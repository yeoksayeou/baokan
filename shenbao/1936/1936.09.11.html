<h3>歐洲二大對壘勢力之消長</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>軍備競爭與同盟外交。為國際戰爭之最重要原因。而數日以來。歐洲軍備競爭及秘密外交之進行。其勢之湍急。其事之危險。實為歐洲史上之空前現象。意大利陳兵南歐。悍然進行其第三羅馬帝國之計劃。德意志增兵達百餘萬。咄嗟之間。可橫行全歐。實現第三帝國之理想。蘇聯則减低軍役年齡。法國則力謀軍火之儲蓄。英則積極建艦。多瑙萊茵之間。小國星羅棋布。而軍營砲壘。亦如雨後春筍之崛起。然軍備競爭。微同盟外交為輔。則其毒尙不致於卽刻發作。今歐洲二大對壘。一則以法蘇為中心。一則以德意為領袖。進行其外交工作。已極露骨之能事。西班牙方面之活動。姑無論矣。波蘭方面。羅馬尼亞方面。捷克奧匈方面。均有連縱合橫之政術家。施其按倆。由外交戰而化為血肉戰。其間分隔祗一髮之微耳。</p>
<p>第一次大戰以前。三國同盟與三國協商之主角。亦卽構成今日法西斯蒂陣綫與反法西斯蒂陣綫之國家。自德奧恊定成立。意奧匈三國集團。與德意志已凝成一片。陣綫旣佈置妥當。乃從事於向外發展。西則鼓動西班牙之內亂。以壓迫法國於比利牛斯山之麓。及威脅英國於直布羅陀峽之間。自伊倫失陷。西班牙之法西斯蒂勢力。巳有奪得政權之可能。此德意陣綫之成功也。東部方面。羅馬尼亞向為法國之友邦。前任外長蒂他萊斯哥。為親法派之領袖。捷克南斯拉夫與羅馬尼亞三國之所以有强固之團結。多瑙河流域所以有十餘年之和平。氏之努力居多。今則以國社黨在巴爾幹活動及德國之經濟誘力之結果。羅閣改組。蒂氏去職。一黨獨裁下之羅馬尼亞。大有轉入德意陣綫之趨勢。此法西斯蒂方面之又一成功也。餘如捷克德意志黨之蠢動。匈牙利攝政之傾向德國。均證明中歐之法西力量。日向東南發展。巴爾幹又成為歐洲角逐之戰塲矣。</p>
<p>在法蘇陣綫方面。發展亦甚迅速。國際聯盟之國家。多為該陣綫之同情者。而波蘭之親法。允為法蘇二國外交之成功。方國社黨跋扈於丹澤及西來西亞一帶之際。波蘭為自固其圉。捨德國而就法蘇。亦其宜也。法蘇外交。失於巴爾幹而得於波蘭。雖得失略可相抵。然法西斯蒂外交。侵略性至為濃厚。法蘇卽為保持已有之勢力。已非準備大衝突不可。論者往往謂武裝和平。可免大戰於一時。蓋二種對壘。勢均力敵。任何一方。不願處發動戰爭之地位。此種觀察。可以應用於第一次世界大戰以前之國際局面。與目前狀况殊不適合。蓋今日之德意。打破現狀之心。固不可以與一九一四年相比。而在公開的謳歌戰爭。提倡侵咯之情形下。武裝和平無存在之可能也。</p>

<p>（倫敦）曼哲斯德保衛報頃評論德國元首希特勒關於恢復殖民地一項要求其言曰、該國提出此項要求、不無相當理由固矣、但希特勒昨日所談、似嫌過甚其詞、「總之、希特勒此决宜言、尙屬合乎理性、吾人自當縝密加以研究、意者各國倘能减低稅則、幷統制貨幣、俾世界各國對於各種原料、均能便於取給、則解决之道、固莫善於此矣、但若各大國不能撤發各項貨幣限制辦法、不能减低稅則、不能將委任統治制度、推行於各該國殖民地、更不能將其所管轄之委任統治地、聽由國聯會管理、則德國上項要求、縱非不能滿足、亦恐難於貫澈矣」云（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>北冰洋　萬公里不停飛行的成功（上）</h3>
<p>— 麥逸譯</p>
<p>在雲霧遮空，風雨交襲，冰雪梗阻的惡劣的氣候之下，蘇聯英勇的飛行家契卡洛夫（Chkalov）巴都柯夫（Baidnkov）貝里雅柯夫（Belyakov）三人，終於完成了北冰洋區萬公里長距離的不停留飛行。飛機為蘇聯自製的“An125”號，於七月二十日自莫斯科附近飛機塲起飛，經巴倫支海—法蘭士約瑟地—塞佛納雅齊莫呈亞—堪察加的　魯巴伐羅斯克，於二十三日下午一時四十五分，在尼古拉也佛斯克（卽廟街）附近小　烏達　着陸。計全程　，三七四公里。沿途所受阻難，真是無以復加：契卡洛夫曾為文　這次飛行的經過甚為動人，茲譯之於後。</p>
<p>當我回想我們這次飛行的全程，首先要記起的，是在莫斯科附近飛機塲動身時，一刹那的　量。</p>
<p>一切都凖備好了，我們坐在機璩裏，馬達旋動着；督造“An125”號機的工程師史多曼（Stoman）舉手關照我們，應該起飛了。我便在飛掛裏　回首對巴都柯夫和貝里雅柯夫作着信號：</p>
<p>「全都好了嗎？」</p>
<p>「全都好了。」</p>
<p>我開放了　飛機開始滑進，沿那水門汀路飛駛起來。大羣送行的人們立在二公里長的路的中心，機的速力增加着，把他們掉在後面，我揮手向他們致意，看他們蠕動的回轉。但誰也不曾想到飛機離開的地面，祗有丟波哩也夫（Tupolyev）算得非常準確，他恰恰立住在那裏—飛機就在那裏離開了地球。我見着丟波里也夫，向他揮揮手。</p>
<p>打了一個小圈子以後，我把機頭轉向北面，飛行的最初幾個鐘頭就由我駕駛。我一面駛着，一面對着貝里雅柯夫說：</p>
<p>「睡吧，保養你的精力」</p>
<p>但是，像這樣剛開始飛行的當兒，誰能够睡得着呢！動身時的輿奮，使我的朋友無論加何不能合攏雙眼。</p>
<p>飛機開入雲端，不斷地向北進，在達到較高的天空，雲霧愈加濃密起來，但我們却愈飛愈高。大約經過了九個鐘頭，我們飛抵巴倫支海。（Barents　Sea）</p>
<p>我們是在海面了，飛騰於雲霧中一處比較明朗的閒隙，很淸楚地看得到海中小塊的碎裂着的冰塊。這裏，我們飛行的高度更加增高，……三十公尺，三千五百公尺，繼續在雲霧中前進。現在，改由巴耶柯夫駕駛，我蘿一州啊！我接替巴都柯夫是在到臨維多利亞島（VictVoria　Js　and）以前，當時我却對他發命令了：</p>
<p>「你一定要睡眠，一定，巴都可夫：」</p>
<p>我仍舊像剛才一般駕駛着飛機向北飛，過了一些路，里維柯夫告訴我應該變更方位，—我們必須轉向法蘭士約瑟地（Frauz　Toref　Land）。。我們已經飛了十　個鐘頭，出乎意外的，雲霧頓然散去，我看到飛機下面的陸地了，我不禁對我的同伴喊起來：</p>
<p>「法蘭士約瑟地！看，法蘭士約瑟地到了！」</p>
<p>我們拍了照，法蘭士約瑟地的莊嚴和美麗，眞使我們驚異；這個沈靜的自然的景物—偉大的北極，確乎引起我們不少的興趣。我們在道裏掃視了很久，直到霧氣遮蔽了我們的視綫。</p>
<p>接着，我們飛向塞佛納雅·齊莫里亞（SSeveruayaZemllya），沒有到達這個地方以前，我就呌巴都柯夫代我駕駛，我决定要休息。我睡在油槽的上面，覆着皮製睡氈，打算熟睡。可是氣候很冷，睡不熟，祇能躺着打瞌。</p>
<p>當我起身時觀察四週，下雨，天空被濃密的雲遮蔽，我們上面有雲，我們下面也有雲！這樣，我們祗能本着經騐，作盲目的飛行了。優秀的機手巴都柯夫，他簡直在黑暗中摸索，然而很使人驚奇的，他却依然操縱得非常純熟。　七月二十一日早晨到達塞佛納雅·齊莫里亞，我們始終在北緯八十度處徘徊。從僅有的雲的隙縫間，僥倖瞰視到幾座島的輪廓。稍後，我們飛向大陸，機頭對着諾特維克（NNor　　　　）和脫克亞　（Tirse　Bay）。氣　的條件非常惡劣，我們穿過很厚很濃的雲霧，並和極猛烈的旋風掙扎，纔到臨哈坦加灣。（Khatanga）。</p>
<p>從這裏，我們飛抵沃里尼克河（Oyenek　River），再赴勒納河（Lena　Piver），過勒納河轉向脫克西灣。大約未達脫克西灣而離它還有十六到二十公里時，我們改對堪察加（Kamchaka）的卜魯巴伐羅斯克（Petropavlovwk）地方飛行，逾越雅庫次克（Yakutsk）的許多山脈。</p>
<p>我們在四千至四千七百米突的高度飛行，氳氣漸漸地稀少下去，使高空中的呼吸有些困難。可是，我們却仍舊不加戴吸氣的面罩，因為計算我們自己所帶的　氣，僅僅足够六個鐘頭的飛程。我們必須保留它直到飛行於從卜魯巴伐羅斯克至大陸的鄂霍大克海（Okboisk　Sea）的路綫上。</p>

<h3>我國世運足球隊　勝日內瓦賽維特記　日內瓦各報一致好評</h3>
<p>中央社日內瓦通訊　數日以來、日內瓦的大街小巷、張掛着很大的廣吿、寫着「日內瓦賽維特隊、定於本月二十日晚六點一刻與世運會中國足球隊友誼比賽」、日內瓦對於體靑素有興趣的、固不必說如何的望眼將穿的等待這一天來臨、卽平素不甚注意體育的人們、也不免磨拳擦掌的等待觀戰、與其說觀戰、莫若說是好奇、因為這是日內瓦體育界破天荒的一次、第一次與中原建兒接觸、究竟中國的體育家、是怎樣的身手、道就是他們所急待領略的、在這裏的大多數人對於勝負的推測、總以體格與技術為標準、好像是賽維特隊可以操必勝之券、以久經大敵的賽維特隊、好像是也未把中原健兒放在心裏、又何况羣衆的心理、足以增加他們的驕敵之心呢、可是日內瓦各報、已為他們抱着戒心、在比賽之前三日、各報的態度、好像對他們下了一些警吿、在本月十八日的日內瓦報（Journal’de　Geneve）上說、賽維特隊在二十日晚將與中國足球隊比賽、我們應知道這十一位天朝的潠手（指中國隊）、在過去二十九决國際戰中、廿三次操過勝利、四次是勢均刀敵、雖在世運中一次敗於英國、但却是一個光榮的敗、……因此各地不斷地請求比賽……」、繼而說「中國隊在技術方面、甚為堅强、運轉之速神出鬼沒……」、同日的瑞士日報（Lasuisse）上說、「這是一個僅有的機會、因為中國隊是一個旅行的性質、一定會引起觀衆的特別興趣、……而這塲比賽、恐怕不是平凡的、因為該隊（中國）曾和最强勁的德國較量過了……」、在十九日的日內瓦論壇報（La　Tribune　de　Geneve）上說、「……賽維特俱樂部、從不使他們的觀衆失望、因為他們專邀請眼前最著名的足球隊、到他們的塲中、在明日晚、他們就要和中國出征世運會的選手相逢了、觀衆們是何等的興奮與焦急的等候着呀、……自很久以來、這是第一次邀請著名的友軍……」、足見在他們驕傲的等待中、也表現着疑慮、在十九日晚日內瓦的車站月台上、鵠候着很多的僑胞、此外還有賽維特俱樂部的代表、大家的目光、似乎都注射在一個方向於機輪轉動的聲中、這二十二個中原健將到了日內瓦、當晚下榻於賽維特俱樂部預定的旅館、記者隨之亦至旅館與我國隊員略談、當時觀察其旅途疲倦的神情、對於明日之戰、頗抱杞憂、僑胞們凡會到旅館晤面者、實有不期而同的感想、因彼主我客、彼逸我勞、我們口中雖有鼓勵之詞、心內實不敢太抱樂觀、歸宿後幾不成寐、</p>
<p>翌日（二十日）比賽的時期將近了、記者於四時半至旅館與各隊員同棹進茶、五時半偕同出發、見各人倦旅情形、雖未恢復然而精神振作、快樂融融、車中談笑、怡然自得、最奇怪的是無人談及比賽的事情、一若對於勝負毫無介意、不能說不是久經大敵、司空見慣了、記者亦因之增加了不少勇氣、</p>
<p>賽維特塲遠在郊外、車行一刻鐘、我們到了、但是在那探出塲外的高杆上靑天白日滿地紅的中華國旗、與瑞士國旗、隨風招展、早巳觸入我們的眼簾、記者因對我國隊員說、這是第一次、第一次我國國旗、飄揚在瑞士的球塲上、我們甚望牠多飄揚幾次、隊員諸君相顧而笑、</p>
<p>初到時觀衆尙不甚多、但到了開塲時、四面八方已圍得水洩不通、正面廂位、巳感恐慌、遂不得不臨時加價、計的有觀衆三千餘人、可惜不是一個星期六的下午、或星期日、否則觀衆定當超出幾倍哩、</p>
<p>比賽開始了、賽維特代表向我隊長貢獻了鮮花一束、以表友誼的歡迎、可謂客氣之至、在最初的二十分鐘內、賽維特的攻擊、猛烈異常、我方似乎側重防衛、未能反攻、這時記者回頭向觀衆的座上一望僑胞們有的面如土色、有的慌張不安、不知是如何焦急、但一轉瞬間、第一個球巳從李惠堂君的脚上、踢進敵人的門去、我方反守為攻、敵陣表現了紊亂、但彼方體格較佳、兩腿旣長、身體高大、佔了不少便宜、所以在上半塲終止時、以二對二之比、但有幾决當我方攻擊緊張之時、彼方竟將球踢回其本陣、或踢出塲外、以避危險、未免太不大方、所以觀衆們齊聲呼嘯、表示不滿、而當我方勝利時、觀衆亦同樣鼓掌毫無偏袒、觀衆的公平態度、惹起彼方守門者大駡曰「蠢的觀衆……」、這固然是很失禮、但我回想當時我的態度、也不免太偏私、因為我只為自家鼓掌、可是我相信僑胞們、也正和我相同吧、</p>
<p>在上半塲我方的陣勢如下</p>
<p>黃紀良</p>
<p>李天生　麥紹漢</p>
<p>陳鎭和　徐亞輝　張顯源</p>
<p>卓石金　孫錦順　李惠堂　馮景祥　楊水益</p>
<p>後備軍　蔡文禮·黃美順·李國威·曹桂成·賈幼良·在下半塲我方陣勢、略有更改、卽以賈幼良代楊水益、以楊水益代替卓石金、十分鐘後下半塲開始了、因為在四十分鐘以內、就要决定勝負、所以雙方均更起勁、觀衆尤為緊張、在這半塲、雙方均有懲罰、我方大都因雙手觸球的關係、此外我方則最守規矩、頗得觀衆的同情、在前二十分鐘內、我方又得了一球後、二十分鐘內、雙方苦鬥尤烈、彼方企圖恢復平衝、然而竟未能得手、總結果我方以三對二勝、僑胞們在半小時前的忐忑心理、已轉為趾高氣揚、好像得着無上榮譽、觀衆們亦不斷的鼓掌、並有很多人來向我方隊員致賀、很多的兒童們包圍着我隊員拍肩握手、天眞爛漫的表示着羨慕與尊敬、當晚九點鐘我駐國聯代表團、及駐國勞代表團聯合在日內瓦中國飯店設宴為隊員諸君洗塵、並慶賀勝利、賓主盡歡、將近午夜始散、中華隊於翌晨赴巴黎、聞在巴黎將作兩塲比賽、在哈佛一塲、在倫敦亦有兩塲、的於。月四日由義大利那坡里搭輪返國、</p>
<p>翌日日內瓦報（Journal　deGeneve）上第一句就說、這是何等的驚奇呀、賽維特竟敗於中國世運隊之手、觀衆或因好寄驅使、或欲觀看在十五天之前在世運會與英國周旋八十分鐘之久的中國隊員之身手、在另一方面因日本世運會足球隊、與居立克格拉掃波斯隊比賽、（記者按十丸日晚日本世運足球隊以零對十六敗於格拉掃波斯）、所以均不相信中國隊是賽維特的勁敵、但是結果吾人始信中國足球高出日本、該報於叙述比賽一節中、說在開塲時、賽維特確實表現了很大的努力、中國的陣綫常在他們的壓迫中、中國方面似乎只有招架無力反攻、但中國隊之守鬥者之敏捷、前鋒健將之厲害、實出乎意料之外、一轉眼竟轉守為攻、繼而說中國隊員因對於眞其前鋒健將、（指李惠堂）有堅固的信仰、故精神頗為一致、而傳球之速、又有鬼神莫測之能力、同時他們的主將（李惠堂）亦絕不使他們失望、最後說……論體格與技術、賽維特本應佔優勝、假如中國隊能向技術方面多下工夫、卽歐洲之各著名球隊、均不能不發生動搖、該報並勉勵賽維特應取長補短、努力整頓、同日的瑞士日報說、我們很好奇的等候着賽維特與中國友誼比賽、賽維特曾與歐洲各名隊甚至與非洲名隊比賽過多决、然而與亞洲比賽還是第一次、這次比賽中國勝利了、但是上半塲賽維特之猛攻、足使中國隊只能招架而不能還手、一般人以為中國隊之對賽維特、不免如日本之對格拉掃坡斯隊、最低限度賓維特亦可以四或五對零中原選手、終不免失敗、乃不意其守門者之靈捷、旣足以防衛、而前鋒主將之雄猛、竟能在二十五米突之距離、將球踢入、其隊員傳球之速、眞是毫無失落、相形之下、我們覺得賽維特諸君動作太遲緩了、該　也說論技術、賽維特實不應敗陣、但當時賽維特之陣綫旣紊亂、態度有時亦不其使人滿意、前鋒主角興中國隊之健將尤不能匹敵矣云云、</p>
<p>誠然此次中華隊之遠征在疲憊的放途上、廿九次國際比賽、能以二十三次勝利、四次匹敵、不能說不是驚奇、同時亦打破了歐美人對於我國體育界素來之觀念、這個不朽的紀念、實為有　宣傳之一、我們由愛護心及敬仰心、允熱烈的希望我們的隊員諸君、將此次遠征之經騐、取長補短、百尺竿頭、再進一步、將來在國際上位置之重要、可斷言也、</p>
<p>記者猶憶本年七月時、南開大學敎授張彭春先生過日內瓦、在日內瓦國際研究院的五日學術講演、聽衆逐次增加、每以講究掌聲雷動、歷數分鐘不斷、日內瓦大學敎授幾乎全體動員、其感動力為從來所未有、而不期一個月中、中國體育界又在此打了一個勝仗、日內瓦的華僑、能參加此為次快事、又何其榮幸　、</p>

<h3>北平研究院七週紀念　李書華報吿研究工作與經費　懷仁堂內拓片展覽學術講演</h3>
<p>（北平特訊）國立北平研究院七週年紀念日、今日（九日）九時在運料門內該院大禮堂、舉行紀念會、該院院長李石會因事在京、不及北返出席、特由副院長李書華主持一切、平市學術界前往參加者異常踴躍、到會者有徐炳昶·吳正之·陶希聖·李麟玉·福開森·李書田·查良釗·曁各界代表等共約二百餘人、屆時開會行禮如儀、首由主席李書華報吿七年工作之概况、繼由該院歷史考古組主任徐炳昶報吿該院與國立北平圖書館合組拓片展覽、各方情形、分誌如次、</p>
<p>李書華報吿</p>
<p>今日本院七週紀念日、院長本擬參加、因南方有事、不能返平、表示極為抱歉、本院開始籌備民國十七年、正式成立民國十八年、今已滿七年矣、成立時所定方針、與各機關各學術團體合作、數年以來、與各方合作事業頗多、鐳學研究所藥物研究所與中法大學合作地質學研究所與實業地質調查所合作、本院與中央研究院及各大學合作、組織太平洋科學恊會、設立海洋生物研究機關、在烟台成立渤海海洋生物研究室、派專入駐烟採集及研究工作、又與靑島市政府合作、組膠州灣海產動物採集團、合作辦法、關於考古工作、與陝西省政府合組考古會、實行陝西古蹟調查及古物發掘工作、本院經常費每月三萬元、我們自己覺得對於國家每月三萬元、未敢浪費、尙不充裕、所幸各庚欵機關帮忙甚多、中法庚欵補助鐳學研究所國幣七千元、藥物研究所國幣七千元、又法金二萬法郞、中英庚欵補助設備費國幣十萬元、補助物理研究所六萬元、化學研究所四萬元、各庚欵之補助、深為感謝云、</p>
<p>徐炳昶講演</p>
<p>此次乘北平研究院舉行七週年紀念會、在懷仁堂陳列各項拓片、此項物件悉在陝西考古時所搜集、其中多為重要部分、今日陳列拓片之表現、但均分組陳列、珍貴者、為唐太祖之石像、及老子之道德經、中國石刻原流、以石鼓·石刻等歷史最悠久、而石像似為漢武帝時代所創、距今的有二千餘年、張遷·武王侯·及昆明池之石刻、亦極聞名一時、關於漢畫在甫陽發現甚夥、陳列者多屬外間未見之品、老子道德經之碑、發現於陝西、為八梭形、所存者已甚尠云、</p>
<p>吳正之講演</p>
<p>略謂、北平研究院今日七週紀念、而中國科學界在此七年間、亦有長足之進步、科學雖早、發起研究、但理化諸科、較三十年前巳有顯著之進步，其成續、處處均可表現、北平研究院在七年過程中、亦有最大之貢獻、北平為全國文化中心、各處名勝及建築物、均能表現中國偉大精神、研究院能在此文化區中蔚然存在、而文化區有此新興科學組織、亦足為幸運云、</p>
<p>陶希聖講演</p>
<p>題為學術與社會之關係、大意謂中國七年來、不獨學術有進步、卽社會亦有進步、因為社會之進步、而影響學術之進步、年來社會進步、實受社會經濟崩潰使然、中國近七年來、可謂最不幸時期、如荒災·匪患·不一而足、但此種種惡劣現象、自有其將來之希望、至於科學產物、如社會不能接受、决不能推動社會進步、蓋舊的心理與新的組織、勢難吻合、舊心理完全基於利的方面、例如小手工業之紡車、若駕之以馬達、當然不克應付、換言之、應視社會有無能力接受科學、欲求社會與科學進步、目前中國社會舊組織已全崩潰、新科學已有急需希望研究院同人今後對研究所得、如何應用於社會一點、實有注意之必要云、講演畢、</p>
<p>本體聚餐</p>
<p>的二時始行散會、會後在懷仁堂後福昌殿空塲攝影、藉誌紀念、旋赴懷仁堂聚餐、約百餘人、席間談笑風生、頗為熱鬧、迄一時許始散、（　）九月九日</p>

<h3>中央大學之最近四年（五）</h3>
<p>— 羅家倫</p>
<p>（三）整理學生宿舍</p>
<p>本校學生宿舍、過去大部分係租用民房、致散處各方、管理上至感不便、且時有非本校學生混入住宿、不特有遠校規、亦且增加學校開支、妨得公共秩序、本校有鑒及此、認為整理宿會、實係刻不容緩、乃於經濟狀况極端困難中、猶勉籌巨欵、建築較大宿舍二所、將過去租賃之房屋全部退租、使一部學生集中於校內弟一宿舍、女生則集中於校內、女生宿舍、至大部分則集中於新建之宿舍、均按人編室、以便學校易於管理、學生便於自修、經此决整理之後、不特管理方便、宿舍頓呈整齊劉一之規模、而且使多年來為社會指摘政府顧念之非在校學生在宿舍居留問題、得以全部解决、</p>
<p>九、擴大校產面積</p>
<p>四年來、校產面積、亦有重大之增加、承江蘇省政府之盛意、議决將近郊烏龍慕府兩山林塲、撥贈本校、計烏龍山面積七千七百餘畝、幕府山面積六千餘畝、合計一萬三千七百餘畝、又在崑山江浦兩縣購擴充農塲、共一百一十八畝、並在校本部附近、增購敎職員第六宿舍一所、計費一一·八零四元（此係二十一年底所購、為時尙在决定建設新校址以前、（最近給價收買新校址的共五千餘畝、此增置校產之大概情形也、</p>
<p>十、集中學院地點俾資觀摩便利</p>
<p>以前各學院辦公授課及研究地點、均極散漫、有同院各茶分在不同地點者、更有一系之中、各課分在各處講授及實騐者、幾經籌劃、現在較為集中、茲以中山院為文學院、科學館為理學院本部、東南院為法學院、南高院為敎育學院本部、新敎室為工學院本部、農學院本係集中三牌樓、自無變更、</p>
<p>十一、集中行政機關俾增辦公效率</p>
<p>以前行政各處組辦公地點、極為星散、接洽不便、監餐難周、茲將大禮堂兩翼、重加間隔、妥為布置、將學校行政機關、悉數遷入、時間旣能節省、效率自可較增、</p>
<p>十二、改革會計制</p>
<p>學校經濟之監督考核、端賴會計制度、本校積習相因、會計漫無成法、流弊所及、甚至人人可以代賣公物、代買公物、而無從加以限制、爰聘請會計師三人、妥立會計制度、於二十一年秋頒布施行、其時尙在政府制定會計條例以前、務使一切賬目、條分縷析、隨時可查、隨時可繳、並確定庶務手續、公開標準物價、留存物品樣件、以便隨時稽核、</p>
<p>十三、維持發薪定期力求敎職員生活安定</p>
<p>四年以來、幸蒙政府維護、敎育經費得無虧欠、然遇熱河閩變諸危難時期、本校亦屢呈捉襟見肘之現象、但無論如何、均曾維持規定發薪時期、不肯移後一日、以維持教職員生活之安定、</p>

<p>新家庭與衛生</p>
<p>— 沈兆荃醫師主編</p>
<h3>中國的靑年有無戰鬬力？</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>一個人想以一個衰弱的身體，去取得成功，是一件可悲的事。一個人活力低微，至於不能愉快地自動地工作，而只由意志勉强着去工作，是一種可憐的景像。</p>
<p>須知一個人所能實施的最大聰明之經濟，就是儲藏起最大量的體力和精神力，以為獲取成效之具。在遭遇非常大事的時候，成功與否，却要看你准備着多少戰鬬力。換句話說，就是要看你有沒有相當的能力儲藏着？這個時候的問題，全看你所儲藏着的能力是否足以使你應付得過？因為强旺的體力，可以使人在事業上處處得到勝利；所以我們相信康健為人生戰鬬中得到勝利的第一條件。</p>
<p>看罷！現在中國的靑年，一般多是贏弱的身髒，萎靡的精神，隨時隨地，都會給我們以驚心怵目的印象；像這模樣的人，有無戰鬬力？可以不言而喩。所以我們的國勢積弱的根源，民族身心的弱點，其極大癥結就在這個地方。若是我們還抱一點奮發圖强的决心，去救國家於危亡的話，必須准備着大量的戰鬬力，如此，平日須要有健全的修養，中華民族纔有復興的希望。</p>
<p>生理學家和醫學家都證明：吾人的體力，精神，和智力，皆由腦劉經產生出來的；所以我們欲培植健全的腦筋！必須奮力除去在黑暗中毀減生命力的『神經衰弱』症，才能够走向光明之路！我們知道要致勝這種惡疾（神經衰弱）須得常服滋養神經的藥物。現在世界醫師所信用的誠Memory者Neurotic（米美爾補腦汁）就是强壯神經，健腦補血的特效劑。能解我們的困乏疲倦，去我們的疾病痛苦，播種健康與幸福，是近代科學至尊無上的貢歡。據各國醫師實騐報吿，凡身體衰弱，精神頹敗的人，不論其原因為先天不足，或病後失調，或荒淫酒色，或勞思過度等而起之氣血虧損與神經衰萎種種症候，都是『米美爾補腦汁』所能迎刃而解，於服用數星期後，即能得着新的活力，去對付一切，自能應付裕如。</p>
<h3>氣喘發生之原因及療法</h3>
<p>— 俞琦錫醫師</p>
<p>氣喘之發生。除神經作用外。血液之性質變化。亦與有莫大之關係。考吾人血液之循環。所以能循正規不變者。全賴製造血液臟器之健全。與夫肺臟皮膚氣體交換之適宜。排泄器官之正當。以及內分泌腺之官能無害耳。內分泌中與氣喘有關係者。即甲狀腺。腦下垂體。副腎。睪丸及卵巢等是也。苟此等腺體一旦官能障礙血液之組成。即因之而變化。斯時好酸性血球或淋巴球增加於腦下垂體及副腎罹病時為尤甚。臨床上因血液或分變化。呼吸即緩悵。炭酸因之增多。酸素因之缺乏。苟此等現象達一定程度以後。血液發生中毒。氣喘之發作。即由是而起矣。</p>
<p>氣喘之治療。若以鎭靜劑應急。祇能緩解一時之苦。大都不克全治。故難免再發之慮。自一千九百〇五年Kaplan氏對於氣喘應用副腎製劑Adren　Alin以來。近世之治療氣喘者。莫不應用內分泌腺之製品。例如副腎之Suprarenin及腦下垂體之Hypophysin均為治氣喘之要品。茲有「哮立平」Hol-ipin一藥。即根據上述原理。採用各種內分泌與麻黃精之混合製劑。不獨收效神速。且其功用有根本治愈頂防再發之特效。遇氣喘發作乏際。給與「哮立平﹂Holipin三片。吞服後約隔五分或十分鐘即見發作症狀消失。病者恢復健康。斯無他。即氣喘發作之時。患者血中所缺乏之副腎及腦下垂體之人分泌素由「哮立平」Holip-in服用後而補足血液組成。即復歸生理狀態。故一切病狀。頓時消失矣。且據歐西臨床家之經騐。謂氣喘患者如平時能持久應用「哮立平」Holipin二至三月。即年久難治之老氣喘亦大多能得根本痊愈云。故歐美各國醫師治療氣喘。現皆拋棄注射方法。專用「哮立平」給患者內服。非祇效力可靠。且安全無害。尤適於家庭治療也</p>

<h3>幸福之敵！　手淫之惡影響</h3>
<p>— 章元楨醫師</p>
<p>神經衰弱</p>
<p>手淫所受之毒害。以腦神經衰弱症為最著。患為時感頭重。頭痛·暈眩·耳嗚·近視·失眠健忘·記憶减退。思想滯鈍。無勇氣和決斷。神志恍惚。動即心悸。精神萎靡。憂鬱寡歡。全身倦怠。缺乏生活力。不能作業。胃納失常。胸脹背痛。消化不良。形容憔悴。貧血贏瘦。雖當壯盛之年。巳呈衰邁老態。總之。病象叢生不盡所述。</p>
<p>攝養與療法</p>
<p>本症之康復法。須努力除去不良的惡習——手淫——避免心身過勞。此外應服用神經系强壯劑。據歐美專家之臨床經騐。以『米美爾補腦汁』Memory　Meurotic最有著效。神經衰弱的種種病象。服後即可迅見消失。自覺頭腦淸爽。精神愉快。思想靈敏。體力旺盛。元氣倍增。</p>
<p>遺精</p>
<p>手淫——能使性神經之射精中樞成為過敏。稍受刺戰。立時就會發起性的興奪——便有夢遺·遺精·滑精等現象。患者須注意一般攝養方洗。治療可用『福郎固精片嗡』Folan　Tad．在就寢前吞服二至三片。即日生效。連服二星期就能痊愈。如有生殖器性的機能障得者。是由於精元虧損所致。必須同時兼服補腎强精劑以『還爾童』Well　Tonic為最有力。</p>
<p>性機能障碍之特效治療</p>
<p>精液——為靑春活力之源泉。若因手淫或性交而消耗過度。則能阻止正常之發育。以致成為生殖器之萎縮短小。或使性機能發生種種的障礙。如陽萎·早洩·快感缺乏等。以致斷絕生殖作用。</p>
<p>性機能障碍之治療。惟以內服畢丸腺製劑『還爾童』Well　Tonic最有特效此為世界醫師所公認之强業劑也。</p>
<p>肺病指迷</p>
<h3>人體與癆菌作戰……</h3>
<p>— 沈兆荃醫師譯自德國肺病月刋</p>
<p>——亦須有堅固之防禦線——</p>
<p>肺結核又名肺癆病。其病原為結核菌（即癆蟲）此菌侵人肺臟後。即於肺部滋生繁殖。而發生硬結。故有肺結核之名也。</p>
<p>結核菌（癆蟲）之抵抗力極為强大。無論何種內服藥與注射藥。皆不能撲滅之。惟有恃吾人體內天然之防禦力。由白血球將結核菌圍困。而於其外又生結締織為之堤防。築成堅固之防禦線。使此菌不能奪圍而出。併絕其糧道。其後該菌方歸死滅。故以結核菌生活力之頑强。非吾人有此天然之防禦機能。實不足以制其死命也</p>
<p>但世人不知利用此防禦力。為根本之治法。乃欲謬恃藥物以撲滅其病菌。故患者往往先服中藥不效。改服西藥又不效。續服報紙上宣傳之各種特效藥又不效。或服猴棗·對口菌·紫河車等種種單方又不效。暮四朝三。百藥亂投。如是者久之皆不效。於是病勢日趨嚴重。終至不可救治。堪為太息。</p>
<p>近世學者所倡導。治療肺癆之惟一方針。惟有以人力補助方法。謀增進患者自身之防禦機能。强盛其肺部生理上的抵抗作用。而促其自然治愈之機轉。最為安全有效。吾人倘欲增進患者之防禦力。及促進其自然治愈之生理上的機能。別無良法。惟有利用臟器製劑之內服（即肺臟與脾臟中提出之內分泌所製之『肺活』Phith　Weal一藥。）始可達到此目的云。</p>
<p>按臟器製劉之『肺活』Phith　Weal係根據德國柏爾託爾特A．A．Berthold及英國史泰林Starling二大生物學泰斗倡導臟器療法之原理而創造。其成分為壯健動物新鮮肺臟及脾臟中抽出之內分泌所製。曾經世界各國肺病療養院。作長期臨床實騐。對於一二三期肺結核·久咳·咯血·哮喘·氣急·潮熱·盜汗等一切癆症現象。確認有非常之效果。非任何化學藥劑之所及。全球醫師均以『肺活』Phith　Weal為現今醫學之名角。有風靡及革新治療界之氣槪。今將此稱臟器療法用於肺病治療異乎一切化學藥劑之優點分述於左。</p>
<p>（一）能調和新陳代謝。促進內分泌之機能。使已衰退之組織復活。以達到生理的防禦機能旺盛——尅服癆菌。</p>
<p>（二）可依組織再生之機能。而塡補病　之缺損。並促進結締組織之增殖。使病　形成疤痕。而促進治愈之機能。縮短經過期間。</p>
<p>（三）於病　之周圍。築成鞏固結締之牆壁。使之硬化。旣造成此完全之堤防。結核菌（癆菌）遂被封鎖。失其活動。終必完全消滅。</p>
<p>（四）刺激脾臟之機能。以促進造血之作用旺盛。而使體重增加。營養佳良。</p>
<p>（五）對於病　之浸潤。能吸收之或溶化之且能抑制癆菌毒素之分泌中和體內毒素。發生解毒作用。故服至數日後潮熱盜汗即可消失。</p>
<p>（六）能增加胃熱。及促進分泌之作用。使消化力旺盛。食慾增進。</p>
<p>（七）有强大凝血力。不論大小咯血。防止效力均甚顯著。</p>
<p>（八）有產生特異之免疫體。能增加體內抗毒作用。並使結核之感受（性體質改造為不感受性（即謂免疫性者）有癆治癆——無癆防癆。</p>
<h3>寫給靑春的女子們</h3>
<p>— 虹口產科醫院婦科主任　陳杏芬女醫師</p>
<p>女子的健美　任何人皆知的朕兆是月經。月經若照常的來潮。按期的反復時。大槪其性的機能。不呈何種異常壯誠。同時可知其身體也無什麽變化。當然是健美活潑</p>
<p>月經正常。就是表示女子身體的健全。若是月經不順。這就是表示女子身體的病弱。所以月經為女子身體健否的測定表。我每見靑年的婦女。顏色蒼白。精神憂鬰。身體衰弱。一經診察和探詢的結果。十有九人。都是月經發生了異常的緣故。</p>
<p>月經不調所發的病狀。大槪是月經前後的苦痛。月經不是過多。就是過少。經期不一定。或一月數次。或數月一次。下腹和腰部常時感覺脹痛。血氣虧損。並發神經衰弱的各種病象。如頭痛。不眠。肩酸。心跳。飮食不振。嘔氣。便秘。小便過多。頭暈。疲勞。浮腫。全身倦怠。性列殖哭的機能障礙。性交時疼痛。性慾減退。發生冷淡及不感症。這些病症的容態。由患者身身的陳述。可以知道實是不少數。</p>
<p>靑年婦女罹患月經的悲慘狀態。眞是苦不堪言。破壞夫婦的美夢。引起家庭的不和。因為精劉的苦悶。將靑春健美的幸福。完全銷蝕在這個月經痛苦之中。是何等可惜。那末。月經的障碍。須及早施以適當療法。且要注意攝生。切不可輕視忽略的。</p>
<p>家庭治療月經不調的藥劉。在臨床上確有效果者。首排『美奴寗』Menorrin此藥對於婦人科的疾病月經不調！赤白帶下。歇司的里（即女性之神經衰弱）等症。如服用『美奴寗』Menorrin且促進女子性器之發育。調整月經。使性感滿足。且能亢進新陳代謝。去瘀生新。補血强生。可預防婦人之老衰現象。久婚不孕者。用以調經種子。無不靈騐。曾經多數醫師之確實證明。認為婦女保健之源泉。</p>

<h3>證券　債市上落範圍狹窄　　各債僅小一角至二角半</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、市况稍見疲軟、在平時存帳數目钜大時、就當前環境論之、其波濤必已甚钜、然目下存　數、除九六金長外、祇餘二千餘萬、新交易絕對不起、已有無形統制現象、交易　前途、殊不易開展、因此市價上落、範圍亦必甚狹窄、昨日經過、上午兩盤、稍形疲軟、四十七及五十三號賣出、十一號買進、十六號亦稍有買進、大都均了結交易為多、大數買賣、直等鳳毛麟角、兩盤行市、亦祇小一二角左右、午後兩盤交易尤為淸淡、市况亦趨　於混沌、有恍惚不定之象、證券交易、在此種環境下、而不起交易、必有原因、前途尚無甚希望也、市價結果、略小一角半至二角半、成交總數、計共四百四十六萬五千元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元、）</p>

<h3>紗花　本月新籌碼略缺　近期紗氣勢愈昂</h3>
<p>紗市　上日狂漲之後、昨則又吿穩定、趨勢較為平靜、但現紗生意不若上日之踴躍、而賣價尚堅挺、某大戶之空額、依然抵補、兼之本月份交貨新籌碼略缺、所以本月份氣勢愈昂矣、</p>

<h3>棉價低昂無定　外埠棉價有見漲說　結果遠期較為堅昂</h3>
<p>棉市平穩、美棉雖回挫、而印棉狂漲、日鄭豫津等處棉價上漲、人心愈堅、於是新拋者益稀市態尚歸、不過天時漸漸放晴、棉田受惠不淺矣</p>

<h3>疋頭棉布現貨大缺　本街舉行秋委廉價營業驟盛　長江流域購買力增加銷路活躍</h3>
<p>昨紗花平穩、棉布市面繼續挺秀、且經連續巨額走動後、存貨廳缺、十六磅·十四磅粗布經軍裝　及津帮大批採辦後、市上存底已枯、各檔一顧致缺乏、市盤均各漲起每疋五分至一角、內地帮採辦最殷、本街門市競於昨日起舉行秋委大廉價、顧客擁擠、營業驟盛、長江沿綫各埠、因本年收穫豐稔、購買力稍增、各貨走勢活潑、前定花色貨·各廠印花絨·直貢·嗶嘰·綫呢、每天派貨隨到隨裝、白貨·細布·細斜·粵·桂帮　辦仍力、昨又成交四百餘件、津帮大批粗布·粗斜辦進後、連日分批裝運、滇帮辦鴻章廠三羊直貢·嗶嘰·美恒等廠縐紋呢·直貢緞·綫呢·光華·仁豐廠士林布及本廠細布·粗斜·恒豐廠老花貢呢等貨二百餘件、華廠直貢·嗶嘰·受東貨四君子昂騰影響、亦增價每碼五厘之譜云、</p>
<h3>海律斯呢殊少需求</h3>
<p>海律斯呢、繼香水呢而風行一時、後因價賤、反為購者所不喜、本年春委售價突漲、則又嫌其昂貴而　之、今秋該種海律斯、開價更貴、普通貨齊售五元半、低檔貨亦需四元六七角、買方因之更不敢進配、祇剪樣先向顧客兜售、然顧客則嫌其多毛而不柔、甚少需求、致市銷見滯、出路呆鈍云云、</p>
<h3>客銷漸動　元芳四價有增無减</h3>

<h3>糧食　麵粉近漲遠跌</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈先疲繼穩之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥小一角零、坎拿大小二三角不等、當開價時、以天時轉晴、洋麥又見微小、故開價時、曾見平平、十一月份以下、因多頭回出、廠方策套、曾回跌一分半左右、惟業外多頭又陸收進、致以後各盤、又復逐步回上、迨至下午開盤、本月份交易雖少、以浮空抵補、市氣見緊、　銷雖不暢、外行依然拉住、遠期則心思殊異、外行雖有收進、出戶亦湧、勢呈盤旋、後步情形、須看實銷能否繼起、然後方入正途云、</p>

<h3>洋荘芝蔴交易復盛　英日意商均有問訊　行家趁低亦在補進</h3>

<h3>厚粳薄稻价尙平定</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、仍祇十二三號、貨共二千餘石、惟零　銷塲均淡、致市况難見回起、厚早粳及薄稻行情悉無上落、東新粳亦屬相仿、廠棧河下俱平、羊川等新尖無軒　、陰變元亦乏榮辱、</p>

<h3>客秈貶價引起粵銷</h3>
<p>昨日客秈新到續有近萬包、本客去化亦有一萬五千包、但連日到頭不絕、存底漸厚、因廣帮停辦數日、市上堆積更多、行販貨主莫不急求脫手、前昨粵帮重行辦裝後、貨主頗有貶價求售、昨市随見回小五六分、去路以粵化為主、辦去沙漢糙米湖南碎砶糙機米安慶米等七千包左右、汕頭亦去湘贛機米三千包、其餘統為本街辦去</p>

<h3>新詩人應有的運動</h3>
<p>— 雷石榆</p>
<p>近年來中國的詩壇，確實蓬勃得多了，但事實上却並未有『近年來的詩歌刋物，新詩集之有如雨後春筍』這種現象。就以所謂文化之樞紐的上海來說吧，不外二三個的詩雜誌，而且不是　花一現，便像在徒刑的審判中似的，老露不出第二回面目，在一年中出現的新詩集也不過寥寥而且薄薄的幾冊。只有在報紙上在一般文藝刋物上，詩作品常常佔了一些地位，表面上看來，似乎相當熱鬧的，但僅比較的地熱鬧些而巳，因為牠是依存着一般文藝雜誌的蓬勃之故。然而把視綫朝向整個的詩壇，就不能不說依然陰氣沉沉了。</p>
<p>全中國不　沒有一個定期的詩歌雜誌，這當然是由於中國的詩人們的無組織。所以他們的活動，也無集團的力量，創作實踐也無計畫，和無統一性。</p>
<p>中國的詩人們如不應着這個多難的時代的洪流，統一地　織起來，廣汎地發展下去，雖有提供我們產生偉大的作品的現實，也會被現實壓倒我們的。</p>
<p>我不反對「詩人俱樂部」等的組織，但若僅採取少數人的集團形式，我是極端反對的！現在我們應提倡而且要從速實踐的是「中國詩歌恊會」的創成。只有這樣統一的地，計劃的地，普遍的地，關聯的地建立中國詩歌的陣綫，詩歌運動才能强健地有效地發展。</p>
<p>中國的出版界是糟透了的，尤其是對於詩歌依然忽視，不但沒有一僩書店肯出版一個專門詩歌雜誌，就是一個文藝刋物跟老板訂發行的合同時，也往往以這個雜誌有多少老大家執筆為前提，而編輯者也老抱偶像崇拜，或『封建的系統主義，化分人事，一分藝術』的通病。更甚的，是不少老閻以雜誌為商品化的漁利政策而至為騙取的一種手段。</p>
<p>在騙局滿佈的出版界中，加以作家生活無保障，出版無把握，創作活動無自由，文化的無發展决不是偶然的。這常然是由中國社會的政治經濟及和那相滲透的複雜關係所形成的結果。但作家無組織，無統一的鬬爭戰綫也未嘗不是一個大原因。</p>
<p>無相互間的批評，鼓勵，無永恒的努力現在，跟着緊張的世界情勢和中國社會之急激的變化的展開，我們的文藝家自覺地携手起而為新詩歌努力。</p>
<p>詩歌是藝術中的一部門，也是人類最先發生的藝術，而且一向被稱為「文學之王」的。然而這「文學之王」在我們中國的現文壇上却依然像「文學的走卒」，但我們也並不要為牠建立「王」位，而是要使牠配當民族解放鬬爭中的有力的喇叭！</p>
<h3>驢</h3>
<p>— 魏東明</p>
<p>「你的牲口老實嗎？」</p>
<p>那是我第一次騎驢，在今年春天，偶然散步走出了校門，幾個驢夫圍上來兜生意；山於想嘗試一下的好奇心，再加上那正是閒得發悶的時候，就跟一個臉上有麻子的中年驢夫講好了價，說定了騎往城門口去。明知道不會有甚麼危險，因為是第一决，心里有點害怕，就緊跟着那樣問，擔心遇見崛强野性的牲口被它摔下來。麻子一邊回答着驢子性子好極了的話，一邊走下土坡把拴驢的繩子從木樁上解下來。等到他牽了繩子往坡上拉的時候，驢　着不肯動，把嘴都扯歪了還是掙着不邁步，一直到驢夫用繩子的一頭在它背脊上抽了兩下，才懶懶地踱上土坡來。這情形增加了我的疑慮心：</p>
<p>「你的驢怕是性子太崛强吧。」</p>
<p>「不礙的，牲口一歇下就懶怠動，跟人一樣。您放心上去好啦。」麻子驢夫這樣回答，他的笑使人覺得他是和善可靠的。他讓驢停在道旁，把鞍子正了正，又把肚帶勒得緊了些，隨後扶着我騎上驢背，帮助我把兩隻脚揷到蹬子里去。看着我扯起了韁繩，端坐在鞍子上靠後那地方，他就走到前面，拉着繫在驢的左臉皮帶上的一段鐵鍊子，吆喝一聲，驢就開始走起來。</p>
<p>剛起上驢才走上幾步的時候，心情很緊張，神經時刻在警醒着，走了一段路就漸漸安靜了。可是正在稍稍放下心來的時候，驢離到了大道，掙着要往一條通到學校的敎授住宅區的小道上走下去。我趕緊又提起心緒，恢復了緊張的狀態，敎驢夫把牲口牽到原路上來。他吿訴我，想讓牲口往哪邊拐，只要緊拉一下靠那一邊的韁繩就成。隨後他又解釋，從小道過去那敎授住宅區里，有幾家的小畢生常常騎驢玩，驢認熟了這個地方，所以不等人說，就往那條道上走。</p>
<p>我讓驢夫還是拉着驢頭左邊的鍊子在旁邊走，走得越慢越好。為了消磨這空閒的時候，同時遮掩這驢走得太慢的情形，我開始尋我一些話來兜搭着跟他談。</p>
<p>「你家住在哪兒啊？」</p>
<p>「就在園子東邊，靠鐵道的村子里。」</p>
<p>「貴姓呢？」</p>
<p>「好說您哪，我賤姓李。」</p>
<p>接着他問我貴姓，我吿訴了他。</p>
<p>「你家幾口人？」</p>
<p>「五口，兩個大的，三個小的。」</p>
<p>「沒有老的嗎？」</p>
<p>「都過去了。」</p>
<p>「三個小的都是你跟前的吧，幾男幾女呢？」</p>
<p>「都是我跟前的，三個丫頭。」</p>
<p>「有個男孩子也好，都念書了嗎？」</p>
<p>「你可是說，哪念得起書呵。」</p>
<p>「園子里大學堂不是有民衆學校嗎？白念書，不花錢。」</p>
<p>「可是家里吃的有三頓沒兩頓的，沒有凖時候喫飯，再加上也沒有穿得出去的衣裳。在家里也可以攬點兒活計做，檢點野菜家里吃。」</p>
<p>「你老早就指着趕驢過活嗎？」</p>
<p>「本來在老人手里還有十幾畝地，可是東捐西稅的又趕上幾回子荒年頭，就借帳押出去了，到我接下來就剩下一條拉磨的小驢了。」</p>
<p>「地押給誰了呢？」</p>
<p>「還不是地面上的大戶？把地文書押給人家使了錢，到時候還不起就歸了人家了。」</p>
<p>這時候驢巳經走上了跟鐵路平行的鄕村土道，靠近車站的一家煤廠門前，一輛小的裝煤車停在那里裝貨，駕那車的也是一匹毛驢，它面朝着我們走的這條土道站着，迎着我們把脖子揚着呌了起來。我騎着的驢子也揚起頭朝着它呌起來，而且踢着後腿要往煤廠那里跑。談話因此不得不暫時中止了。我有些害怕地緊抓着韁繩，想像着用怎樣的姿勢掉下去才可以摔得輕一些。麻子驢郤一點也不忙亂，很熟練地拉着鐵鍊使驢的頭低下來，捺着它使它在道停一會兒，才又牽着它慢慢地走下去。他吿訴我不用慌，不要害怕，這是常有的事；一條驢在半道上看見別的驢，就要兩下都呌喊起來，就像我們人在道上碰見，要互相招呼說，「你上哪兒去啊？」一樣。聽着這話的時候，我的因為發慌的心跳，巳經恢復常態，倒覺得他的話天眞得怪可笑的。又想到了問他，這兩個驢是不是有哪個是母驢，他說都是公驢，母驢是不會呌的。</p>
<p>談話就從人轉到了驢身上。麻子驢夫誇說他的驢安穩可靠，不會把人從背下摔下來。而且——</p>
<p>「你是初騎的，騎常了的人還專要跑得快的呢。從西山八大處跑下來，一路四五十，一氣跑下來，跑到了地方，人下不來驢，驢滿身是汗，站着時候驢腿驢肚子都直哆嗦，嚇，那眞是！……</p>
<p>「那你怎麼跟呢？」我揷進話來問。</p>
<p>「可不也是緊跟着跑，跟不上就遠遠地追着跑！」</p>
<p>就這樣，正如他說的，越騎越膽大，我就吿訴他不用在前面牽着，就跟在後面把驢趕得快一點也可以。實在前面的道路是夾在穀子地中間的，已經不容許一個人跟一條驢很從容地並着通過了。他答應着　又敎繪　　要想讓人驢站住，只要把　繩往後緊拉一下，喊着「吁，吁」……它就不走了。他說着就繞到了驢子後面，　喝出另一種聲音，這條驢就放快了脚步，得得地沿着土路跑下去，在身旁它踢起了　土，這塵土圍繞着驢蹄像黃色的濃烟。</p>
<p>迎面有輕微的風拂在臉上，我騎在驢背上一顚一顚地，感覽着慢走時候所沒有的一種輕快。在背後我聽見驢夫跟着跑的脚步聲，伴着漸漸響起來的咻咻地吁喘。</p>
<p>這樣走下去　時候驢子偶然把頭仰起來向上看，我以為又是呌喚又是踢腿了，就拉了韁繩喊着「吁吁」，驢站住了。</p>
<p>「怎麼的啦，前面又沒有它的夥計，它怎麼又犯病了？」我回過頭來問驢夫。</p>
<p>「不碍的，」他跟上來用手撫摸着驢的後股和肚子：「它抬頭是看看老爺兒，看看現在是甚麼時候了。」</p>
<p>他隨卽又吆喝着道牲口重新跑起來。在這簡單的動作中，我看出了他不止對於這條牲。有着深切的了解，而且有着無限的喜愛。</p>
<p>從郊外的士道轉向大路，城門巳經在望了。</p>
<p>自從那次騎驢以後，到現在一直沒再騎過。前幾天走出校門預備進城去，幾　驢夫和人力車夫又是圍上來兜生意。對於以前那個驢夫老李雖然因為一道上他只是跟在側面或者後面，沒有淸楚地看到他的面貌；但是他的麻子我是認不錯的。這回圍上來的人里就有一張這樣熟悉的麻于臉。我對他說；</p>
<p>「你不是老李嗎？這回我不騎驢了呢。」</p>
<p>他看見我認得他，顯得有些高興，就退下去在一排停着的人力車中間拉了一個出來橫在我面前，出乎我意外地：</p>
<p>「嚇嚇，你上車吧，往哪兒拉，你瞧着給。」</p>
<p>我坐上了車問：</p>
<p>「老李，你把驢賣了買了車啦嗎？」</p>
<p>他回答着：</p>
<p>「嚇嚇，車是租來的。」</p>
<h3>某　行</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>女巫之家</h3>
<p>— 尹光</p>
<p>我的女房東是個女巫，當我才找着這個屋子的時候，覺得各方面都很滿意，尤其是房租便宜，但等我知道了下面的客堂，是一個供神的地方，四週都掛着　有求必應」「誠信則靈」，這類的匾額時，我當時就猶疑起來，旁的倒沒有甚麼要緊，第一我就是怕來燒香的人太多，那就一定會鬧得人不得不安寗。其次是怕他供的是狐仙，因為據別人吿訴我說，這東西是很小氣的，稍為一句話說得不對，馬上就會弄點鬼把戲給你看。我雖然不迷信，然而和這種東西朝夕相處一定是很討厭的。於是我便問和我接洽的這個老太婆——後來我才知道她就是女巫。</p>
<p>「你們是，供的甚麼菩薩？」</p>
<p>她回答道：「是呂純陽太太。」</p>
<p>我忍不住笑了笑：「燒香的人多麼？」</p>
<p>「不多，不多，你住久了就知道了」。她像是看出了在怕吵鬧的樣子，很着急的搖着手這樣回答我。</p>
<p>我因為她旣不是供的狐仙，又不會吵鬧，便决心搬來住下了。現在將近住了有三個月，這一家人的生活情形，我也很熟悉了，而且還對他們感到悠然的與趣。</p>
<p>他們一家共六個人，兩老夫妻，兩個兒子，兩個女兒，一家人都是不折不扣的農民，好像長久的都巿生活對他們毫無反響一樣。</p>
<p>老頭干有四五十歲光景，然而人非常康健；身體高而瘦，頭很小，頭髮花白，眼睛小而深陷，但是有一個小而尖的鼻樑陪襯起來，樣子到還不過分討厭，聲音非常粗暴，平常和人談話都像吵架似的。當我第一天搬來的時候，因為一把拖布還沒有我着適當的地方放，暫時放在樓梯口，他看見了便用起他的大喉嚨，對着替我搬家來的朋友吵起來。我的朋友嚇得不敢開口。我想這可糟了！怎麼那天看屋子的時候，並未見着這樣一個老頭子呢？</p>
<p>到現在我才淸楚了他是生成這樣一副喉嚨，並不是安心和誰吵架，然而這是使人够受的。</p>
<p>他是在替一個外國人種花　　　　　　　　　　　　他愛貪小便宜，那怕是一段銹了的鉛絲，在他也是好的。他常常從外國人那裏拿許多東西回來，甚麼綠的油漆呀，白的油漆呀，桐油石灰呀。這些東西都是用香烟罐或是別的罐子盛着，再用報紙包好，小心謹愼的端回來，一到下午他沒有事情可作了，便提起一罐油漆，不是把那扇門油成綠的，便是把這扇窗油成白的，你總見着他在不停的油就是了。因此將一個屋子裏弄得來這裏一塊綠，那裏一塊白，這裏又一塊黑，不成個樣了。我想在他看起來或將是很好的。他們的神像面前每天都供着鮮花，這不必說也是老頭子拿回來的了。他很怕他的妻子——那個女巫，每遇着她不高興的時候，他用了他的大喉嚨和誰在談話的時候，她妻子放下了臉孔來這樣對他說：</p>
<p>「你又在哇啦哇啦做啥？」於是他會一聲也不響的跑去作事情了。自然又是弄他的油漆。</p>
<p>他們一家都很節省，吃得很壞，穿得也很壞。老頭子常常對別人這樣說：</p>
<p>「你不要看有些人穿得很好麼？眞實他連房租也付不出哩」。</p>
<p>他們的大兒子，是在一家皮鞋店裏學生意，也是這家庭裏面唯一漂亮的人物，他好像與這家庭沒有發生多少關係了，只是每晚回來睡，天一亮又去了。</p>
<p>第二個兒子，是某小學的快要畢業了的高小學生，奇怪的是他對他母親作這種生意並沒有甚麼不滿意的表示。一個暑假只是和別的孩子們玩玩蟬子，燒飯時替母親生生火，並未見着他摸過一决書本，他的年齡並不算小，十六七歲，看起來很高大，有一次我問到他的母親說：</p>
<p>「他小學畢業後，還打算再讀書麼？」</p>
<p>「不再讀了，你看隔壁的中學生不是閒在家裏好久了麼。我是沒有那樣多錢給他讀書」。她說的時候樣子很憤慨。</p>
<p>她又繼續說道：</p>
<p>「我的根弟進學堂，還是光生答應只收半費，半年共　　　　　　　　　　　　起」。還附帶的說到了她的二女兒進學校的原因。</p>
<p>二女兒是個　養慣的七八歲的孩子，很了半年嘗，連男女先生也分不清楚，至於書本上的字，更是一字不識，倒是和着別人哇啦啦的念得很好。</p>
<p>大女兒很像母親，尤其是那雙有長而黑的睫毛的大眼睛，看起來是一個假精靈的樣子。不過她那一張蒼白色白臉孔，和那個完全是骨頭的身體，是遠不及她的父母了。她在一家香烟廠作工，包夠一條烟卷，有一角半的工錢，然而就是這樣廉價的工作，也並不是每天都有的，多半隔一天去一次，甚至要碰到一月以上的長期失業。</p>
<p>現在要說到這家庭裏面的主要人物——女巫了。單看她的外表，並不像一般的女巫那樣陰陽怪氣的可怕，和平常一般的四五十歲的老太婆沒有大差別。身體矮而微胖，頭髮烏黑，眼睛很大，睫毛長而黑，說話時眼睛眨得很快，一望而知是一個利害的老太婆。她的右脚頸比左脚的粗些，走起路來不很方便。她會替人醫病，替小孩挑驚。醫大人的病，是靠她的菩薩，醫小孩是靠她自己的經騐。生意到還不錯，常常都有人來求籤，藥方是籤票上印就的，至於一次給多少錢，那是隨便病人了。我看這個收入到很有限，主要的是要靠她醫小孩的病，對於目己的兒女，人們是樂意多出幾個錢的。——她並沒一定的時間，隨到隨看，一次總有四五毛錢，據說出一次診，還有兩三塊可拿。我有一次會親眼見着她替一個嬰兒挑口裏的白點，她不慌不忙的從藥箱裏取出一根寸多長的針來，並不附消毒，一隻手掀開了嬰兒的嘴，一隻手送進針去，挑得啵啵啵的響，血順着她的手指流了出來，嬰兒哭得失掉了聲音，母親把頭掉開了不敢再看。但她仍是很鎭靜的挑着，臉上沒一點表情，好像她是在一塊木頭上挑。手續完了，便用一根金屬製的管子，一頭放上一點白色的藥粉，吹進了嬰兒的口裏去。等別人走的時候，送上一小捲角票在她手裏，她這才笑了，說道：</p>
<p>「不要客氣囉」！一面慢慢的送進衣袋裏去了。</p>
<p>她們的菩薩是裝在口玻璃箱裏面的，有一次我要求她大女兒給我打開來看看，她很嚴重的拒絕道：</p>
<p>「我不參開！」</p>
<p>「為甚麽呢？」我奇怪了。</p>
<p>「要等我媽來，她是仙骨，菩薩不會怪她。」於是我便問起了她們的「呂純陽太太」一由甚麼地方得來？她很慷慨的把她們供神的原因吿訴我了：「我們從前沒有供神，在三年前我媽病在床上一動也不能動，我爸也病了，還吐過血咧！有一天晚上菩薩附在我媽身上，說要她供她，因為她是仙骨。若相信她們的病都會好起來的。後來果然病都好了。還醫好了許多別的人。」</p>
<p>「那麼菩薩又在甚麼地方請來的呢？」我說時用手指着神像。</p>
<p>她很自若的回答道：「那是在城　　買來的。」</p>
<p>「菩薩也能用錢買麼？」我幾乎這樣地呌出來！但實際上却含糊道：「唔」！便支吾過去了。</p>
<p>這老太婆病倒是沒有甚麼病，只不過在她那支特別粗壯右脚頸上，有一團紅色的丹毒，每月總要發兩三次，一發作起來，就一步也不能走，只好躺着，發出厲害的呻吟，而她那拿喜歡吵鬧的丈夫，便也暫時間變成一個啞子了。</p>
<h3>今天我在白堤向審美者敬禮</h3>
<p>— 大保</p>
<p>今天惚促的旅行，</p>
<p>把我的足跡印上西湖的白堤。</p>
<p>我來這裏要追尋天國的和諧，</p>
<p>要欣賞審美者的靈魂安息的地帶。</p>
<p>在白堤乘風散步，</p>
<p>我一路追懷古代的詩人——</p>
<p>他們歌唱神聖的和平，</p>
<p>歌唱美麗的春天，</p>
<p>靑春的愛情……</p>
<p>他們以不朽的詩篇，</p>
<p>獲得了後代男男女女的崇拜。</p>
<p>我向一切審美者致敬，</p>
<p>他們代表了人類的最崇高的靈魂，</p>
<p>他們向當代和後世傳播幸福的歌音——</p>
<p>首先我向白居易敬禮，</p>
<p>他反對戰爭，歌唱和平；</p>
<p>我向蘇曼殊敬禮，</p>
<p>他歌頌出世解脫痛苦；</p>
<p>向蘇小小馮小靑我都敬禮，</p>
<p>她們的生世本身就是一首動人的歌曲。</p>
<p>和平的詩人，</p>
<p>風流的歌女，</p>
<p>死後你們長眠在美麗的湖邊，</p>
<p>算是找到了自己所歌頌的境界。</p>
<p>可是，我要以讀者的名義</p>
<p>向你們寗靜的墳墓叩問——</p>
<p>是否一切理想的名字，</p>
<p>墳墓是牠最後的歸宿？</p>
<p>西湖有寗靜的水波，</p>
<p>湖邊有微風與楊柳，</p>
<p>古代的詩人在樹影底下安息，</p>
<p>今代的遊客在樹影底下徘徊，</p>
<p>他們來這裏躱避都會的吵鬧。</p>
<p>在都會，在塵世，</p>
<p>人間失却了優美與和諧。</p>
<p>今天，仍舊是亂世！</p>
<p>我們在屠刀之下生有；</p>
<p>成羣不幸的人類，</p>
<p>沒有誰逃得出現世</p>
<p>他們遭逢着饑餓，痛苦與殘殺；</p>
<p>且慢歌頌靑春與愛情吧，</p>
<p>到處都是禮敎，陰謀與墮落！</p>
<p>今天我在白堤向一切審美者敬禮，</p>
<p>明天，</p>
<p>明天快車又要帶我經過荒野向罪惡的都市回去。</p>
<h3>死的地方</h3>
<p>— 欽文</p>
<p>報載有個四十左右歲的苦力男子，因患病元處棲宿，夜臥於法租界馬斯南路空地工部局安放的水門汀瓦筒中，病重竟死在瓦筒里。能貢公先生以為「有一部份人將會把這一具屍首看做人類的野蠻和羞辱的符號，」認定他是個「不說話的證人。」</p>
<p>勞苦了一生，連可以好好躺着死的地方都沒有，只得偷偷的倒在瓦筒里，是够悲哀的了罷。可是苦力男子，還有死得更悲哀的；據說就在前個月里，集美碼頭的斜坡上，躺着個人，是瘦得皮張里面只有了骨頭的。大槪打算搭上同美汽車回鄕去，但已病得不會走，也說不好了話；正當漲潮，海水浸着了身子，他勉強向着岸上爬，爬了些路就停止。潮水又漲到，才再爬一下。死在瓦筒里的要到臭氣四溢才發覺；他是許多人都眼巴巴的看見的；却正因為這樣，連在碼頭上都死不安穩：為着預防臭氣，把他載到了厦門，也在碼頭上。第二天潮又漲了，他還是死不去，苟延殘喘，於是又這樣：潮漲一點，他爬一下；再漲一點，再爬一下。脚是任凭浸着的，總要海水滾上了大腿，他才拚命掙扎。比較起來，好像死在瓦筒里是還好的了，那可以安靜些。</p>
<p>要自己還會走路，才得找瓦筒去死，元家可歸的人，瓦筒是値得隨時留心的了罷！</p>
<p>看到這種紀載，聽了這種消息，我是很吃驚。這並非出於偶然；七年以前，元慶本在俞樓租屋住。要開博覽會了，俞樓不能再住，他只好搬到葛嶺上去。那里又貴又遠，很多不便，不得已再搬，擠在廣化寺的小樓上，熱悶得厲害。病重了，又不得已，勉强轉到我任課的學校里。使我深深的感到，實在是无處可病，无處可死。</p>
<p>他在藝術上是有了不少貢獻的，但只着於綸畫之類好像吃苦原是應該的。</p>
<p>瓦筒吓！的確是個歸宿麼？</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>稽查處到底是一個甚麽東西</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>明明是一個保護走私機關</p>
<p>冀察當局設立稽查處一事，電傳謂華北私貨，自經稽查處查騐後，祗收按照關稅八分之一之消費稅，卽可在冀察平津等處，自由運銷，不作私貨論，自經此種消息傳出後，全國譁然，大為駭異，認為此種制度，完全破壞我國關稅壁壘，維護走私機關，函電交馳，並向冀察當局質問眞相。</p>
<p>冀察當局，不得已，乃於前日對新聞記者發表設立稽查處之原因，其言滑稽搪塞，一派遁辭，其言曰，該處任務，在淸查私貨，凡在冀察平津境內運銷私貨，酌收騐費放行，但非抽稅，運出冀察等處者，仍為私貨，就據冀察當局公布者言之，華北私貨，自經該處查騐之後，在冀察平津等處運銷者，便不算私貨，在冀察平津以外運銷者，方為私貨，我不知冀察平津區域，與非冀察平津區域，何以發生如此嚴重的區別？其可怪者一。</p>
<p>又謂酌收騐費放行，並非抽收關稅，但關稅收入，實佔國家經濟一大命脈，外貨輸入我國境內，自應照章納稅，今該處何以對未收關稅之私貨，僅收騐費，便可任其自由運銷，此種私貨，理應沒收充公，方是正當辦法，乃該處非但不加扣押，反為之查騐放行，是一經查騐，私貨卽變官貨，還鋿便可無阻，此種機關，明明是一個保護走私機關，其可怪者二。</p>
<p>又謂在冀察平津，得以自由運銷，若運出冀察平津者，仍為私貨，是以冀察平津為另屬一個世界，另屬一個組織，完全不似我國中央政府統治下的一個區域，試問冀察平津，究為何國的土地？何國的人民？何國的政治？自傀儡組織出現，而關外數省之地，旣名存而實亡，自冀察政委會出現，而華北一帶之地，亦屬若明若昧，不可究詰，其可怪者三。</p>
<p>查冀察政委會者，為我國之冀察政委會，該會的委員，均經中央政府所派遺，均經中央政府所任命，該常局自應受中央政府所統治，奉行我國的法令，今其所宣布之論調，完全不似中央委任官吏的論調，完全似一種特別組織的說法，此種組織，若不根本糾正，行之關外而騐，行之華北而亦騐，以後若再推行下去，不知我國將成何等樣的國家，何等樣的民族，何等樣的政治。</p>
<p>然而此種措施，尙未滿足野心家的慾望，現在野心的國家，正在大唱其調整中日關係，大唱其華北明朗化，則現在這樣暗昧不明的局面，畸形發展的組織，或者還有進一步的變化，不可測的危機，我退一步，人將進百步！我退十步，人將進千步，眞是我國地有盡，而人之慾無厭，身負國家之重者不當一念及此耶。</p>
<h3>開學</h3>
<p>— 沈家千</p>
<p>「老娘開着銀行？不要臉的！」隨手把呆着的福生刮了一掌：「有種出穩，這樣笨坯讀什麼書，放在店裏學學生意吧。張開眼睛做夢，預備考狀元？」</p>
<p>福生撫摩着熱辣辣的面孔看着他的父親。父親祗是慢慢向後退着，　過了櫃臺，才有保護物似的開口：</p>
<p>「書自然應該讀的。開了一世烟兌</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>店也沒有見到一個邊（錢），孩子明年就要……」劉才福一時記不起那個難呌的名字，就問福生：「是不是明年就要……</p>
<p>福生看了母親的臉，他提防着第二個巴掌，說得那樣低聲：明年畢業」。</p>
<p>「不是嗎？明年就要畢業，這孩子從來就沒有留過級，讀畢業了總比做學生意好得多，這幾個錢總得用的。」</p>
<p>老板一邊說話，一邊兩支手撑在櫃臺上做着保護的姿勢，看着福生又是怪可憐的站在半邊。老板娘聽見畢業，她也不知道畢業是個什麼名堂，但是從洋學堂畢業出來，大槪總有一點好處的，她從批火油的賬上來打這筆學費了：</p>
<p>「要多少錢？這種笨坯看他畢出什麼花樣來？</p>
<p>老板這才高興了。「福生你說，要多少錢？」福生再把信箋讀了一遍，學費十二塊，書費四塊，圖書館費一塊，一共十七塊。</p>
<p>則則一個顧客跑來丟了二毛說：「一包××牌。」</p>
<p>老板對老伴射了一眼，好像你看吧××牌生意不是很好嗎？一邊回答他的顧客，對不起剛賣完，口口牌好哦？</p>
<p>顧客搖搖頭，收回二毛錢走了。</p>
<p>老板娘捧了一口痰，「見鬼！像不像抽××牌。」搭訕着踅進店堂內室去了。</p>
<p>「老板故意高聲對兒子說：</p>
<p>「福生，吃了飯你看着店，我到北海批香烟去。</p>
<p>心裏自然又是「婦道家不懂事！」</p>
<h3>吃飯去！</h3>
<p>— 舍利</p>
<p>——旅途雜記之一——</p>
<p>——客人！吃飯去！</p>
<p>——吃飯去！吃飯去！</p>
<p>夢裏，猛的被這種聲音驚醒了。睜開眼，太陽剛露臉兒，還早呢。</p>
<p>這兒，是一間破樓，對面兩支舖，別嫌髒，在這小旅館裏算是特等的房間。外面那個大房子裏，擺滿了床，臭蟲可以任意在草蓆上打架，那才是猪窩呢。</p>
<p>樓下是飯館，賣飯，賣　　，各色大麵，小菜却只有便宜貨；這兒的顧客沒有一個人吃得起兩毛錢一盤的東西的。</p>
<p>鎭巿雖小，但因為這兒是進城的大路　來往的人根多，　條街上，倒有　多家賣「家常便飯」連帶「安寓客商」的旅店。</p>
<p>好像有緣似地，昨兒晚上的風雨把我仍阻在這裏了。</p>
<p>沒想到在這靜謐的小鎭市上，一淸早會響起這些嘈雜的聲音。</p>
<p>我恨恨地起了身，扳着窗沿向街土望；</p>
<p>街上：幾個鄉下人忽忽地走着，飯店裏，這家，那家，老闆，伙計，都擠在門口，對那幾個鄉下人招着手，拉開了嘴巴，喊：</p>
<p>——客人吃飯去——</p>
<p>——點飯再走吧——</p>
<p>我們樓下那個老闆娘也是一股笑勁，高聲地喊着。</p>
<p>那幾個鄉下人好像有點膽法，低着頭一直走去了。</p>
<p>街上暫時靜了下來。</p>
<p>可是，等我到樓下去洗臉的時侯，猛的這嘈雜的聲音又飛了起來，正端着臉盆的老闆娘，慌張地把臉盆放到我的面前，就趕到門口去了。馬上我聽見她的聲音。我一回頭：三個人影子剛在門口掠了過去。</p>
<p>老闆娘的聲音住了，臉上很失望。</p>
<p>——喊嗎呢？人家要吃飯總要吃飯；不吃，喊破了喉嚨也嗎用的！</p>
<p>我並不同情她的失望，我覺得用這種喊口號似的方法來招攬顧客是很蠢的。</p>
<p>她望了我一眼，便朝着我走來：</p>
<p>——客人！你那裏知道，從前鄕下人上城，到這兒總要歇歇肩，吃點東西的，近年來，光景不對了，喊，他們還不肯來，不喊，更沒人上門了，鄉下人才壞呢！</p>
<p>——這也不能怪，年頭不好，鄉下人那來的錢吃飯？</p>
<p>夥計在旁邊揷了嘴。</p>
<p>我不言語了，我認為夥計的話是對的，而老闆娘的喊嚷正是利用音的誘惑，在生意的法門中並不音錯，許多都巿裏的店家在拍賣的時侯，不也是呌夥計們戴了紙帽子站在門口嚷嚷的嗎；可惜這種誘惑在「年頭不好」的現在已經失了效力了。</p>
<p>我剛這麼想着，聲者又嘈雜了起來：</p>
<p>——吃飯去!</p>
<p>——吃飯去。</p>
<p>是兩重飢餓的呼聲啊！</p>
<h3>神的威權</h3>
<p>— 瑞芝</p>
<p>——山居雜記——</p>
<p>到山林中來居住，這是有生以來的第二次了。</p>
<p>在一個酷熱的午後，友人的着我到他的故鄕去，他說：「避暑的入只知道到靑烏之類的名山去，可是到我的故鄕，一樣有山水有大森林，旣不費什麼錢，又比名入的避暑地淸靜，那該是我們窮書生的好去處呀！」給友人這一說，我終於在那一天的晚上離開了悶熱煩囂的大都市，到這淸靜美麗的山中來。</p>
<p>在都市里，每天就悶坐在那九十度以上的亭子間里，人也好似整天沒有精神的疲倦，可是一到了這里，一切就都變了，大自然的風景的美麗，山民的生活和談笑，都把一個在都市里困得像隻小烏一樣的我，又改變成一個精神奕奕的野貓了。</p>
<p>夏的原野是可愛的天一亮，烏兒就在屋角上呢喃着，朝陽的臉，像一個蛋黃樣的在山坡後浮上來，一點也不令人感到它是討厭的，它的光，射照在山谷中的田野里，條條約金光閃得像無數金河，農人們，背着農具的或騎着牛背，唱着小調和山歌，在金色的陽光里，開始着他們的工作。午後，太陽爬在樹梢頂，合抱的老榕樹，倒下了一片片的陰影，坐着談天，遙望那遠山的一片綠色和帶着蔚藍的澗流，凉風吹過，那中天的炎陽，好似是朱去了權威，像冬日一樣的可愛。騎着牛背的村童，像名畫上的淸雅，在那澗泉中翻着余黃的水浪。大地是靜寂的，只有樹葉微聲在奏着午睡的催眠曲。</p>
<p>午夜，月亮在遠山的黑影里跳出，一綫雪白的銀光，射進了紗窗，遠望着原野，叢林是一片的白色，窗前的樹影動着，月光就像在水中波動的一明一黑，淸風微吹，四野就好似無數的情侶在私語。明火蟲一點點的飛過，像是天上疾馳的流星。　（未完）</p>

<p>曹笑英玉蜻蜓</p>
<p>中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇「潯陽琵琶」</p>
<p>香山司馬　江州。夜泊潯陽渡古頭。送客黯然同惜別。荻花楓葉晚江秋。想我是，自悲宦　飄萍梗。祖餞登帆水上浮。遙望江心盆浦月。已到了，　更　鼓起　樓。忽聽得，哀聲四起調絃索。為問那，何處凄凉似訴愁。故而，賓主尋常鄰舫近。喚敎他，移船相見半含羞。一見那，秋娘老　猶丯韻。座上　添酒一甌。只聽那，自叙生平縈舊夢。奈何是，春花秋月不重留。鵑絃曲按調銀甲。那知道，鴛帳空戀墜玉鈎。往事不堪回首望。說不盡，幾番衷曲話從頭。見他是。殘脂賸粉空餘恨。血染羅裙舊石榴。到後來，車馬漸稀悲冷落。怎嫁得，浮梁夫婿去難留。宛比是，秋風捐棄宮紈扇。月缺難邀玉斧修。可知道，自古歡塲同宦海。滄桑變易去悠悠。我亦是，天涯一樣飄零客。末路知音淚兩眸。但是，江上琵琶千載恨。為勸你，再彈一曲更何求。都只為，卿卿無物重相贈，翻作新腔作歌曲酬。待到那，曲罷酒闌人去後。一聲歸路聽鳴騶。只覺得，紅粉靑衫雙淚流。</p>
<p>邢瑞亭三笑</p>
<p>上海（一一〇〇）下午四時至四時三刻開篇「關壽峯夜探虎穴」</p>
<p>世事如棋一局秤。風雲變幻歙浮塵。自古多少痴情種。閱盡滄桑感古今。想我是，一片俠腸身傲骨。江湖浪跡十年春。自嗟身世蜉蝣客。慣在風塵　不平。家樹是公了多情變　喜。十分思愛十分情。臨行付託情關重。吃我當留一點心。那知鳳喜是，花蕊一株風雨妬。有誰來作護花鈴。只悔他，誤投虎窟紅顔駐。春鎖重門不見人。一任那，淚滴鵑啼憐夜月。繡幃寂寂泣黃昏。好憑他，暗中阿母傳消息。頓觸英雄側耳驚。所以是，冒險捨身探虎穴。有垣屬耳隔墻聽。竊看那，將軍不改在奴態。有時間，婢膝奴顏乞美人。並且是珠串奇珍多耀目。雅琴受託作調停。萬不料，女兒變愛黃金物。祗重黃金不重情。自古情塲多變態。黃金好買美人心。早知道，鏡支水月空成影。悔不該，疑雨疑雲假作眞。但是我，目覩情形常歎息。一時難遏怒潮平。恨不得，為君斬斷此情種。莫負當年付託深。可歎那，公子鍾情如夢裏，慘成後果變前因。所以是，一封書信郵。傳　。頓傳他　辭别高堂促起程。正不妨</p>

<p>張雲亭玉蜻蜓</p>
<p>敦本（八〇〇）下午九時零五分至十時</p>
<p>開篇「國花」</p>
<p>梅花雖不是花王。品格淸高出衆芳。自古詩人曾品定。花魁名譽世無雙那菊是花中之隱逸。蓮樂君子亦相當。周子愛蓮陶愛菊。兩人志趣並非常。不知道，梅花隱逸兼君子。性淑品高貌亦莊。人世多稱桃李好。桃花艷冶李花香。那梅花。只安常。不願時髦學新妝。艷世風流無俗氣。羞與桃李鬥芬芳。無良媒。亦何傷。藐姑仙子本無郎。山中好友松與竹。夜半淸風月與霜。那凡卉只宜聽號令。誰能够先與占春光。所以說，新月舒眉衆星耀。老梅開口百花忙。天荒地老誰知己。只道人間目盡盲。却不料，多情還有林和靖。知音要說孟襄陽。而今國花推定更榮光。</p>
<p>周振主義妖傳</p>
<p>元昌（一一二〇）午夜零時三刻至一時半</p>
<p>「珍珠塔閨訴」（米米集創刋號）</p>
<p>風塵遊子遠投親。巧遇那，解組陳璉慶壽辰。伍十無兒悲伯道。中郎月女態伶仃。盡堂簫鼓添悲咽。難得千里迨遙大阮臨。冠蓋如去紳宦集。故而內堂傳諭見夫人。夫人面目冷如冰。數言不合成冰炭。傲骨猶如花仰面。終身不第不登門。警動了，屛後關心婢翠屛。挾骨柔腸心伶巧。自言自語自呻呤，上閨樓吿訴女東君。說夫人初而警。繼而嗔.終而冷笑兩三聲。願君匡救慈親故。報答當年舅娘恩。至親一脈善調停。千金聞言渾無主。脈脈含羞百感生。從權相見在綠秋亭。上海市（九〇〇）每日節目</p>

Regarding the dispatch of investigators and warships, he stated that the 19th Route Army is a force that does not obey the orders of the Central Government, which is a well-known fact. If the Japanese side insists on sending warships, the conflict may escalate. He then stated that he absolutely opposed the dispatch of warships and requested the recall of the Saga and the destroyer squadron that had gone to Beihai. Acting Consul-General Yoshitake sternly rejected this request. (Domei News Agency Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Nakano Junzo, the victim of the Beihai Incident, was a zealous pioneer overseas. The statement of his friend Kitagaki Kichiro, head of the World Expo Association, is as follows: In November of the thirteenth year of Taisho (1924), when he was dispatched by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry to travel to Hanoi, he visited Nakano, the only Japanese person there at the time. He deeply appreciated his active role and was very grateful, and they firmly shook hands. Now, looking at the photo taken at the time of parting, he cannot help but feel sad and mourn. Nakano was taciturn, his wife was Chinese, and he was determined to give up hope of returning to Japan and wished to be buried in China. When I was there, the people there praised Nakano's character and gave very good reviews, so when this incident occurred, I temporarily suspected it was not true.

<h3>The Rise and Fall of the Two Major Opposing Forces in Europe</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>The arms race and alliance diplomacy are the most important causes of international war. In recent days, the arms race and secret diplomacy in Europe have been proceeding with such speed and danger that they are unprecedented in European history. Italy is deploying troops in Southern Europe, boldly pursuing its plan for the Third Roman Empire. Germany is increasing its troops by more than one million, and in an instant, it can rampage across Europe and realize its ideal of the Third Reich. The Soviet Union is reducing the age of military service, France is striving to stockpile arms, and Britain is actively building ships. Between the Danube and the Rhine, small countries are scattered like stars, and military camps and fortresses are also springing up like bamboo shoots after a rain. However, the arms race, without the support of alliance diplomacy, would not immediately erupt. Now, the two major camps in Europe are pitted against each other. One, centered on France and the Soviet Union, and the other, led by Germany and Italy, are pursuing their diplomatic work with the utmost barefacedness. The activities in Spain are aside. In Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia, there are politicians who use their skills of alliances and conspiracies. The transformation from diplomatic war to bloody war is only a hair's breadth away.</p>
<p>Before the First World War, the protagonists of the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente also constituted the countries of today's fascist front and anti-fascist front. Since the establishment of the German-Austrian alliance, the Italian-Austrian-Hungarian group has been integrated with Germany. After the front was arranged properly, it engaged in external development. In the west, it incited the civil strife in Spain to oppress France at the foot of the Pyrenees Mountains and threaten Britain between the Straits of Gibraltar. Since the fall of Irún, the fascist forces in Spain have had the possibility of seizing power. This is the success of the German-Italian front. On the eastern front, Romania has always been a friend of France. The former Foreign Minister Titulescu was the leader of the pro-French faction. The strong unity of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania, and the peace of the Danube River Basin for more than ten years, were mostly due to his efforts. Now, as a result of the activities of the National Socialist Party in the Balkans and Germany's economic appeal, the cabinet was reorganized and Titulescu was dismissed. Romania, under one-party dictatorship, has a great tendency to turn to the German-Italian front. This is another success of the fascist side. Other events, such as the restlessness of the German Party in Czechoslovakia and the pro-German tendencies of the Regent of Hungary, all prove that the fascist forces in Central Europe are developing to the southeast. The Balkans has once again become a battlefield for Europe.</p>
<p>On the French-Soviet front, development has also been rapid. Most of the countries of the League of Nations are sympathetic to this front, and Poland's pro-French stance is certainly a success of French-Soviet diplomacy. At a time when the National Socialist Party is rampant in Danzig and Silesia, Poland, in order to secure itself, abandoned Germany and turned to France and the Soviet Union, which is also appropriate. French-Soviet diplomacy lost in the Balkans and gained in Poland. Although the gains and losses can be offset slightly, fascist diplomacy is extremely aggressive. Even to maintain its existing power, France and the Soviet Union must prepare for a major conflict. Commentators often say that armed peace can avoid a major war for a while, because the two sides are evenly matched, and neither side is willing to be in the position of launching a war. This observation can be applied to the international situation before the First World War, which is very different from the current situation. Today's Germany and Italy have a heart to break the status quo. It cannot be compared with 1914, and under the public advocacy of war and the promotion of aggression, armed peace has no possibility of existence.</p>
<h3>Hebei-Chahar Inspectorate General Office; Eight Sub-Offices Being Established; Request Instructions from Ministry on Collection Rights and Limits</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei-Chahar General Inspection Office's regulations and tax collection rules have not yet been approved by the Hebei-Chahar Council. The office plans to start releasing private goods next week and collect inspection fees. Eight sub-offices, including Pingbao and Zhang, are being prepared for establishment. Each office will have one director and several inspectors to assist the customs in combating smuggling. The total operating expenses of the general office are 5,000 yuan per month. Since the 10th, many smugglers have gone to the office to apply for inspection. Regarding customs anti-smuggling and the collection rights and limits of the Hebei-Chahar Inspection Office, the Hebei-Chahar Council ordered Ge Dingyuan, Sun Weidong, Guo Zhihan, Deng Zhexu, etc., to negotiate in Peiping, and also telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for instructions to avoid conflicts and double taxation. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The workers and soldiers of the Qikou Cangyan Maritime Defense Inspection Office reported to Tianjin on the 10th. The person in charge of the Hebei-Chahar General Inspection Office still denies that the office's collection of inspection fees conflicts with customs anti-smuggling. After the collection of fees for private goods, the market price can also be discounted. Various trading companies have now received notices from the office to report and inspect goods. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Now that the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee has established the Consumption Tax General Inspection Office in Tianjin yesterday, North China now has two tax collection agencies, one responsible to the local authorities and one responsible to the central government. Observers are now closely watching whether the customs authorities can confiscate the private goods for which the General Inspection Office has already collected consumption tax. Wang Hong'en, the director of the General Inspection Office, has promised that private goods that have already paid consumption tax can be freely transported to Hebei and Chahar for sale. However, according to news from Dagu, the customs authorities have stated that the establishment of the General Inspection Office has nothing to do with the anti-smuggling team established by the National Government, and the team will continue to serve as usual. Wang went to Qikou yesterday and established a new tax collection agency there, and organized a patrol team in Tianjin to investigate and prevent private goods that have not paid the new tax from being transported to Hebei. According to reliable Chinese sources, representatives of 20 stores selling private goods have now registered at the General Inspection Office, and 200,000 bags of sugar, among other private goods stored in Tianjin, will be taxed and put on the market. Whether the customs authorities can stop the sale of these goods is a question that everyone is asking each other today. Yesterday, news came from Nanjing that the Ministry of Finance has decided not to recognize this new tax. Whether its attitude will be effective will be seen in the coming days. (Reuters Telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Hebei-Chahar Establishes Inspection Office; Kong Ling Another Plan; Establishing an Office and Collecting Taxes Hinders the Integrity of Customs Duties</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Hebei-Chahar authorities sent another telegram to Finance Minister Kong regarding the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Inspection Office, still stating that the establishment of the office is only to assist the customs in anti-smuggling and to prevent private goods that have already landed from being arbitrarily sold in the interior, so as not to conflict with the customs' authority. The outside world's transmission of the facts is too extreme. The telegram did not mention the collection of taxes on private goods. It is heard that Finance Minister Kong believes that the Hebei-Chahar authorities' intention to assist in anti-smuggling is very good, but if they truly establish an office to collect taxes, it will ultimately hinder the integrity of customs duties. He is now based on this principle and ordering the competent authorities to formulate another proper plan. He telegraphed the Hebei-Chahar authorities for inspection on the 10th.

<h3>League of Nations General Assembly Scheduled to Hold Regular Meeting; Forecast of the Situation of Council Seat Allocation</h3>
<p>(Geneva) China had previously requested the League of Nations Council for a quasi-permanent council seat. The Council approved it in May of last year and submitted it to the League of Nations General Assembly for review. At the General Assembly this month, it may approve the Council's proposal to establish a quasi-permanent council seat for China. In addition, the terms of the three current non-permanent council seats, namely Argentina, Australia, and Denmark, will expire this year. The General Assembly will hold elections to replace them. Approximately, the successor to Argentina will be either Colombia or Bolivia, the successor to Australia will be New Zealand, and the successor to Denmark will be Sweden. Also, the Council temporarily added a non-permanent council seat in 1933 for Portugal. Now that Portugal's term has expired, if the country is not re-elected, Latvia will succeed it. (Havas Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly is scheduled to hold a regular meeting on the 21st of this month. The Spanish government will send a delegation to attend at that time. The candidates are Foreign Minister Terbalut, former Foreign Minister Teros Rivo, and Catholic Conservative Party member Galadot, with Terbalut as the chief representative. (Havas Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Economic Committee of the League of Nations met this afternoon and advocated convening an international conference with the participation of the United States, Germany, Italy, Britain, France, and other countries to discuss and resolve the economic panic, and to take stabilizing currencies, eliminating commercial restrictions, and the settlement system as the themes of discussion.

<h3>United States Prepares to Implement Large Battleship and Cannon Policy; Believes Japan's Increase in Submarines Violates Treaty; British and American Representatives Discuss Response</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Navy Swanson announced today that a plan to build two new battleships has been drafted and may be equipped with 16-inch or larger cannons, but this will depend on whether Britain and Japan can abide by the restrictions of the New London Treaty. Swanson also stated that it is best to use 20-inch cannons, but naval experts have expressed doubts about this. The Navy Department is now waiting for President Roosevelt's order to begin laying the keels of the two battleships. Swanson also said that next year's naval exercise will be held in the waters off Hawaii and the North Pacific. (Guomin Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) US Chief of Naval Tactics, Admiral Stanley, told reporters today that if Japan does not agree to the 14-inch gun proposal by April 1, 1937, then the armaments of the two battleships to be built by the United States next year will be "sky is the limit." Secretary of the Navy Swanson also attended the meeting, his first since recovering from illness. It is said that Japan's suggestion to retain 15,598 tons of submarines exceeding their age violates the London Naval Treaty. The United States does not want to take any countermeasures before it is certain how Japan will proceed with this matter. The Secretary of the Navy opposes the establishment of a US naval detachment stationed in Europe, as this move would involve the United States in European political events. (Reuters Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) British and American representatives discussed today what policy the two countries should take regarding Japan's expansion of submarine tonnage beyond the limits of the London Treaty. The British Embassy in the United States sent a copy of the Japanese note to the United States last week to solicit the views of the United States. On Monday of this week, Johnson, the secretary of the American Embassy here, held further discussions with British naval expert Holmes. It is reported that the United States believes that Japan's decision is tantamount to invoking the "Escalator Clause," so the United States also has the right to take similar actions, meaning that the United States has also decided to increase submarine tonnage.

<h3>Hebei-Chahar Inspection Office, Eight Sub-Offices Being Prepared for Establishment, Requesting Instructions from Telegraph Department for Collection Rights</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The regulations and tax rates for the Hebei-Chahar General Inspection Office have not yet been approved by the Hebei-Chahar Council. The office plans to begin releasing private goods next week and collect inspection fees. The eight sub-offices, including Pingbao and Zhang, are being prepared for establishment. Each office will have one director and several inspectors to assist the customs in combating smuggling. The total operating expenses of the general office are 5,000 yuan per month. Since the 10th, many smugglers have gone to the office to apply for inspection. Regarding customs anti-smuggling and the collection rights and limits of the Hebei-Chahar Inspection Office, the Hebei-Chahar Council ordered Ge Dingyuan, Sun Weidong, Guo Zhihan, Deng Zhexu, etc., to negotiate in Peiping, and also telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for instructions to avoid conflicts and double taxation. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The workers and soldiers of the Qikou Cangyan Maritime Defense Inspection Office reported to Tianjin on the 10th. The person in charge of the Hebei-Chahar General Inspection Office still denies that the office's collection of inspection fees conflicts with customs anti-smuggling. After the collection of fees for private goods, the market price can also be discounted. Various trading companies have now received notices from the office to report and inspect goods. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Now that the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee has established the Consumption Tax General Inspection Office in Tianjin yesterday, North China now has two tax collection agencies, one responsible to the local authorities and one responsible to the central government. Observers are now closely watching whether the customs authorities can confiscate the private goods for which the General Inspection Office has already collected consumption tax. Wang Hong'en, the director of the General Inspection Office, has promised that private goods that have already paid consumption tax can be freely transported to Hebei and Chahar for sale. However, according to news from Dagu, the customs authorities have stated that the establishment of the General Inspection Office has nothing to do with the anti-smuggling team established by the National Government, and the team will continue to serve as usual. Wang went to Qikou yesterday and established a new tax collection agency there, and organized a patrol team in Tianjin to investigate and prevent private goods that have not paid the new tax from being transported to Hebei. According to reliable Chinese sources, representatives of 20 stores selling private goods have now registered at the General Inspection Office, and 200,000 bags of sugar, among other private goods stored in Tianjin, will be taxed and put on the market. Whether the customs authorities can stop the sale of these goods is a question that everyone is asking each other today. Yesterday, news came from Nanjing that the Ministry of Finance has decided not to recognize this new tax. Whether its attitude will be effective will be seen in the coming days.

<h3>Kong Ling Another Plan for Establishing Inspection Office in Hebei-Chahar, Tax Collection Obstructs Customs Integrity</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Hebei-Chahar authorities sent another telegram to Finance Minister Kong regarding the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Inspection Office, still stating that the establishment of the office is only to assist the customs in anti-smuggling and to prevent private goods that have already landed from being arbitrarily sold in the interior, so as not to conflict with the customs' authority. The outside world's transmission of the facts is too extreme. The telegram did not mention the collection of taxes on private goods. It is heard that Finance Minister Kong believes that the Hebei-Chahar authorities' intention to assist in anti-smuggling is very good, but if they truly establish an office to collect taxes, it will ultimately hinder the integrity of customs duties. He is now based on this principle and ordering the competent authorities to formulate another proper plan. He telegraphed the Hebei-Chahar authorities for inspection on the 10th.

<h3>League of Nations General Assembly Scheduled to Hold Regular Meeting; Forecast of the Situation of Council Seat Allocation</h3>
<p>(Geneva) China had previously requested the League of Nations Council for a quasi-permanent council seat. The Council approved it in May of last year and submitted it to the League of Nations General Assembly for review. At the General Assembly this month, it may approve the Council's proposal to establish a quasi-permanent council seat for China. In addition, the terms of the three current non-permanent council seats, namely Argentina, Australia, and Denmark, will expire this year. The General Assembly will hold elections to replace them. Approximately, the successor to Argentina will be either Colombia or Bolivia, the successor to Australia will be New Zealand, and the successor to Denmark will be Sweden. Also, the Council temporarily added a non-permanent council seat in 1933 for Portugal. Now that Portugal's term has expired, if the country is not re-elected, Latvia will succeed it.

<h3>Arita's Remarks in the U.S.: Discussing Various Issues in Sino-Japanese Negotiations, No Political Ambitions Towards the Philippines</h3>
<p>San Francisco - Former Japanese Foreign Minister Kenzō Arita attended the Pacific Society and returned home, passing through here. It is said that Japan will compete in trade in the Philippines and will do so fairly. Japan values trade in all parts of the world, and the Philippines is no exception. However, the Japanese have no political ambitions towards the Philippines. What we hope for is only the development of legitimate trade. Regarding the naval issue, Arita declared that Japan has no intention of engaging in naval competition. Japan's current naval plan is based on the principle of non-threatening and non-aggressive. The Japanese government is eager to begin negotiations with China to resolve the outstanding issues between the two countries, but whether we can succeed depends on the situation at the time of the negotiations and China's willingness to cooperate.

<h3>Amidst Internal and External Troubles: French Capital Flees, British Equalization Fund Strenuously Maintains</h3>
<p>(London) The British Equalization Fund again made strenuous efforts this morning to maintain the value of the French franc. After the franc's price fell to 76.85, it gradually returned to 76.79. However, the forward price remains weak, proving that the panic among genuine traders has not diminished. These people are desperately seeking self-preservation and are willing to bear a heavy interest rate of 24% per annum. French Premier Blum's failure to reach an agreement with Durães on the Spanish issue makes the life of his cabinet even more precarious than yesterday. Therefore, bold French capitalists are doing their utmost to move capital abroad to prevent the government from implementing a ban on cash exports. The general public now increasingly believes that a united national government that implements a ban on capital flight will be even weaker than the current government. As a result, the Bank of England's intake of French deposits has been increasing day by day. (9th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) The General Council of the British Trades Union Congress, the Executive Committee of the Labour Party, and the Parliamentary Labour Party held a joint meeting in Plymouth today, deciding to support the non-intervention policy in Spain. This was decided by a vote after heated debate. Labour MPs Hicks and Dalton also reported on this decision after their trip to Paris. (9th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The decision of French labor unions to support the current government has considerably strengthened the position of French Premier Blum. The above decision was made at the closing of the General Confederation of Labour today. In addition to reiterating its full support for the Popular Front government, the Confederation also called on British labor unions to make similar contacts with their government. (9th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Executive Committee of the United General Confederation of Labour held a meeting this afternoon, at which the following resolutions were passed. (1) Germany and Portugal have recently successively submitted reservations regarding the non-intervention in the Spanish civil war, so that genuine non-intervention cannot be implemented. The French government should consult with other democratic governments to reconsider the policies adopted regarding the situation in Spain. (2) The French government must urge the Executive Council of the League of Nations to convene as soon as possible in order to request the Executive Council to strictly implement the Covenant of the League of Nations. (3) British trade unions should make the same request to their government. (4) All members of the United General Confederation of Labour should donate a minimum of one hour's work wage per person to help the wives and children of Spanish Popular Front members who have taken refuge in France. If any employer violates the work contract signed by both labor and management, it has violated the social laws promulgated by the government. The United General Confederation of Labour hereby protests and requests the government to take effective measures to force the employers to comply with the law. (9th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) This afternoon, representatives of the left-wing parties in the Chamber of Deputies held a meeting. The Secretary-General of the Communist Party, Thorez, made a declaration to the meeting, stating that the Communist Party has not changed its original opinion regarding the necessity of providing material assistance to the Spanish government. However, the Communist Party continues to support the general policies of the government. If a motion of censure is proposed at the next reopening of the parliament, the Communist Party will still vote in favor of the government. In short, the Communist Party does not want to make things difficult for the government, but it hopes to reserve the freedom to judge on issues not included in the Popular Front platform. It is reported that the delegation of left-wing parties is an organization composed of representatives of the parliamentary groups of the parties participating in the Popular Front, and its purpose is to coordinate the claims and actions of the left-wing parties in the Chamber of Deputies.

He also proposed that the Socialist-Communist Party Adjustment Committee should meet in the near future to discuss joint actions between the two parties to assist the Spanish government, oppose the arms race, and prevent the resurgence of the French fascist threat. The Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, Séverac, replied to Thorez in the name of the Administrative Committee of the Socialist Party. In the reply, he accepted the proposal for the Socialist-Communist Party to elect a delegation to visit Premier Léon Blum. As for the proposal made by the Communist Party for the Adjustment Committee of the two parties to meet for discussion, he said that "your intention has now been recorded, and we are extremely satisfied."

<p>Plymouth, England - The Trades Union Congress, which is currently being held, continued its meeting today, debating the issues of war and diplomacy. Regarding the situation in Spain, it immediately passed two draft resolutions. The first resolution, concerning the issue of war, was unanimously passed by all representatives. The second resolution, concerning the issue of Spain, was also passed by an overwhelming majority (with only seven dissenting votes). The main points of the two resolutions are listed below. The first states, "If the government wishes to mobilize the country's troops or factories in wartime, we, the trade unions, will not provide assistance and will actively resist it." The second states, "The Spanish Civil War was caused by a small number of military officers betraying the republican system and the legitimate government. The Spanish government and the working class are doing their utmost to suppress the rebels. We have the greatest sympathy for them. The peasants, workers, and young volunteers of the country are fighting for freedom and democracy. We can only pay tribute to their bravery. As for the families of the deceased, we are deeply saddened. This congress hereby reiterates that we will strictly monitor whether the recent orders signed by various governments regarding non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War are detrimental to the Spanish government." It is reported that when the congress opened this morning, a representative named Zach proposed an amendment to the second draft resolution, advocating intervention in the Spanish Civil War. The congress rejected it with 2,978,000 votes against 5,000 votes. (10th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) There was a heated debate on the Spanish issue at the Labor Congress held in Plymouth today, and a resolution was passed praising the bravery of the Spanish workers who sacrificed themselves to maintain freedom and democracy. The most severe measures must be taken to prevent anyone from using international agreements to harm the Spanish government. Now, there is a special responsibility on the British government, which is to ensure that the Portuguese government implements the non-intervention agreement. Sir Walter Citrine, Secretary-General of the two Congresses, pleaded with the Congress to "curb impulsiveness and use brains" in order to support the officially approved non-intervention agreement policy. Citrine also stated that without the current non-intervention agreement, all countries would be transporting munitions to Spain. If any country is still supplying munitions to Spain, it can only be Germany and Italy. The only way to deal with this is to blockade the Spanish coast by sea, or it may lead to military action. Does the British labor movement dare to take this action? Citrine also answered himself, saying that he dare not say for sure. (10th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>German National Socialist Party Congress: Discussion of Cultural Issues, Claiming National Socialism Inherits Humanism, Attacking Democratic, Communist, and Jewish Culture</h3>
<p>Nuremberg: The eighth annual congress of the National Socialist Party opened this morning with a ceremony. After the reading of Führer Hitler's address, a meeting was held at 8 PM to discuss cultural issues. Hitler, government ministers, and members of the diplomatic corps were all present. The first speech was given by Rosenberg, director of the National Socialist Party's foreign affairs group, on the development of humanism. He stated that humanism was originally the essence of medieval philosophy but had long been lost. Now, only National Socialism could inherit the tradition of humanism. Hitler then took the stage to deliver an important speech on the cultural tasks in national activities, attacking Jewish culture, democracy, and Bolshevism. The main points are excerpted below. Hitler first stated, "All the great struggles of the world, in essence, are nothing more than the instinct for human preservation and the tendency for national survival. In modern times, all struggles, traced to their origins, are determined by the purpose of some nations to survive." Hitler then recounted "the terrifying history of the French Revolution," saying that the European continent, having been devastated by the revolution, inevitably suffered the ravages of the god of war. Finally, discussing the history of the late 19th century, he said that every period of history produces great prophets. "If a country's prophet is a politician rather than a writer, then its people can be said to have happiness," he said. Hitler then discussed the various conditions that constitute a national society, saying that only by limiting individual freedom can national unity be achieved. He stated, "The world's major powers have been destroyed one after another by democratic politics, because democratic politics inevitably leads to anarchy. One must know that what has been created through hardship and suffering should not be preserved with weakness and mediocrity. There should be no concession to anarchy. The purpose of Bolshevism is to inject Jewish blood into the bodies of the general population. The Spanish people are being slaughtered in large numbers, and the current example serves as clear proof. Moreover, the destructive actions of Judaism in economic life and its destructive actions in cultural arts are inextricably linked." At this point, Hitler asked economic leaders, religious leaders, and cultural leaders of the National Socialist Party to value the effectiveness of authoritarianism, saying, "Without authority, disasters will inevitably arise, and there will inevitably be an abuse of authority." He also said, "In a certain Christian era, there could only be a certain Christian art. In the era of the National Socialist Party, there can only be a National Socialist art." (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>Nuremberg: During the opening ceremony of the eighth annual congress of the National Socialist Party, Wagner, the leader of the National Socialist Party in Monk City, read Führer Hitler's speech, recounting the achievements of the National Socialist Party under its rule and the four-year administrative plan. Finally, he also mentioned the issue of Germany's demand for colonies, which has already been reported in summary by this newspaper's previous telegram. Here, we supplement the following section of Hitler's speech regarding the demand for colonies. Hitler stated that Germany's reasons for demanding colonies were nothing more than two: (1) Germany's economic poverty; (2) the necessity of demanding colonies in order to obtain the raw materials necessary for national survival. He also explained that the reason why Germany must sell its products at low prices is nothing more than to absorb foreign currency in order to purchase imports necessary for German industry. Hitler first stated that a Jewish Bolshevik party, citing poverty as a reason, incites world revolution, wanting to burn and destroy human culture. On the contrary, Germany strives peacefully to solve domestic poverty. Moreover, other countries have an average of 15 to 20 times more land per capita than Germany. Can it still be said that there is poverty for every person who possesses land? Other countries mostly possess abundant raw materials and arable land within their borders. Can it still be said that there are economic difficulties? In Germany, on average, 136 people occupy one square kilometer of land. Although the German people rely on their genius and perseverance to make the most of the land within their borders, they cannot achieve self-sufficiency in food. Since Germany relies on foreign supplies due to a lack of food, it has no choice but to export industrial products as much as possible to compensate. All of Germany's imports are indispensable, and food is especially important. Therefore, Germany cannot but try to export industrial products, even if it lowers prices and even disregards its own losses. Foreigners who do not understand Germany's economic situation often criticize Germany for not dumping industrial products at low prices. Moreover, the German people, feeling the lack of major economic activity areas, do not hesitate to lower prices and export industrial products in exchange for the food that Germany lacks. If this still cannot be understood by the world, then it is truly regrettable. Hitler then quoted the remarks of a British politician, saying that Germany need not purchase raw materials, so there is no need to demand colonies. Hitler said that these words are quite similar to the ingenious theory of Queen Marie Antoinette of France. In the past, when the people of Paris asked for bread, the Queen replied, "If you have no bread, why don't you eat cake?" Is the intention of the British politician to have Germany abandon bread and eat cake? Moreover, if Germany had not suffered the humiliation of the 15 years after the war, if the world had allowed postwar Germany to retain its overseas investments and colonies, then Germany's economy would not have been so difficult. Today, Germany's domestic economy has prospered, and the number of unemployed people in Germany has decreased from 6.5 million to only 1 million. So far, no other country has achieved such satisfactory results. Therefore, Germany has the ability to manage colonies. Is this not clear proof? (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>Nuremberg: In Führer Hitler's address read at the National Socialist Party Congress this morning, there was a section mentioning the four-year administrative plan, explaining that after the completion of this plan, Germany's required materials could be completely self-sufficient without relying on other countries. Now, we will excerpt and translate the original text of this section as follows: "In the next four years, Germany's required materials can be supplied by the country's chemical and mechanical industries and the country's mines, without continuing to rely on foreign countries. Moreover, after the completion of the rearmament program, a large number of domestic workers will no longer have to do things, and they can be used to implement this industrial construction plan. This is of great benefit to the national economy. As for after the completion of this construction, the country's production undertakings can be increased in many aspects, and domestic commercial circulation will inevitably develop as a result. As a result, exports will inevitably increase. We will use the funds obtained from exports to purchase food and various necessary raw materials as soon as possible. Moreover, Germany will never give up on resolving the issue of colonies, because the German nation's right to survival is no less than that of other countries. In short, the current issue is not about democracy and freedom. At this critical moment, posterity will never blame us for guaranteeing democracy and freedom. What they will blame us for is whether we have rescued the great German nation from the path of political and economic collapse." (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>Nuremberg: The National Socialist Party Congress continued this morning. 40,000 members of the Labor Service Corps, carrying luggage and shovels, paraded in front of Führer Hitler. The pace was neat and uniform. Their heads turned to the right, giving a salute. It took two hours to complete the procession. There were as many as 20,000 spectators, including many parents of corps members. They considered it an unparalleled honor for their children to march in front of the Führer, so they did not hesitate to travel a long distance to visit in person. After the parade was over, the leaders on the podium sang loudly with all the corps members in the field. The lyrics were in the form of a dialogue, with one line responding to the other. Here are some of the key sentences: "We are soldiers holding shovels. When there is land to be governed, we build ditches for it. When there is wasteland, we work hard to develop it. We have filled in coastal lowlands. We are also good at building roads and dredging rivers." It is reported that the Labor Service Corps currently has 300,000 members, with each group of members replaced every six months. Apart from the army, this organization is the most popular in the National Socialist Party. (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) Political figures have recently commented on Führer Hitler's speech on the return of colonies, saying that the British Conservative Party will definitely discuss this issue enthusiastically at its annual congress in Margate on the second of next month. Many members of the Lower House of the party have recently drafted a resolution, which will be submitted to the congress for a vote by Duncan Sandys at that time. The content is: "Regarding the issue of colonies, some countries'妄存覬覦之念 (harbor妄存覬覦之念), which will inevitably cause a major crisis. The members of the British Empire are already very anxious. This party hereby requests the government to clarify this atmosphere. It is still remembered that when former Foreign Secretary Sir Simon visited Germany last March, he told Führer Hitler that the issue of transferring jurisdiction of various mandated territories was not something the UK was willing to discuss. The government is now willing to reiterate this statement." (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times recently commented on Führer Hitler's speech on the return of colonies, saying, "Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech at the Extraordinary General Assembly of the League of Nations in July this year, hoping that the regular meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly in September could submit the issue of the redistribution of colonial raw materials for discussion. In addition, the various mandated territories may also be redistributed in the future. However, from now until then, British public opinion, even if it expresses sympathy in theory for Germany's demand to restore colonies, will definitely not be willing to seriously consider it. But if Germany declares that it will not use war as a tool to promote its policies, and agrees to participate in discussions on the general problems of Europe, then that is another matter." (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian recently commented on Führer Hitler's demand for the restoration of colonies, saying that the country's request is not without considerable reason. However, what Hitler said yesterday seemed to be too exaggerated. "In short, Hitler's 决宜言 is still rational, and we should carefully study it. It seems that if countries can reduce taxes and control currency, so that countries around the world can easily obtain various raw materials, then this is the best way to solve the problem. However, if the major powers cannot withdraw various currency restriction measures, cannot reduce taxes, cannot extend the mandate system to their colonies, and cannot allow the League of Nations to manage the mandated territories under their jurisdiction, then Germany's above-mentioned requirements, even if they cannot be satisfied, may be difficult to implement."

<h3>Triangular Battle in San Sebastian: Rebel Army Only 10 Kilometers from the City; Residents in Extreme Panic</h3>
<p>San Sebastian: An Associated Press reporter arrived here today and saw that San Sebastian has become a scene of a triangular war. Anarchists and Basque parties are fighting in the streets, and the rebel army is fighting the Anarchists guarding the city's edge in the field. Thousands of civilians are rushing to escape to safer places such as Bilbao and Santander. Boats and vehicles are mixed together, blocking the roads. It is reported that 400 Anarchists and other extremists were arrested by the authorities today, including one battalion commander. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>San Sebastian: Judging from today's situation, when the rebel army starts its attack and the outposts occupy the outskirts of San Sebastian, the city's garrison will surrender without a fight. There are still a few Anarchists, who are manning machine guns on the heavily guarded De Ling Que Bo mountain, waiting for the enemy. The biggest problem at the moment is whether the Anarchists really intend to blow up the entire city. The rebel army learned today that San Sebastian's civil affairs director, Otega, has ordered the Basque Nationalist Party to organize a special police force to search and arrest hundreds of Anarchists all day long. However, at the same time, the party is also rushing to handle temporary defenses. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>San Sebastian: The governor of Guipúzcoa Province, Olderga, recently told this newspaper's interviewer that the city and the rebel army are still negotiating to avoid the destruction of lives. However, Anarchists threatened to set fire to the city and throw bombs to show their opposition. The governor appointed Basque Nationalist Party Congressman Irujo as the chief of public security yesterday, who took office immediately. He has also decided to stop such violence by Anarchists and has ordered Basque soldiers to escort 625 National Army hostages to the port of Bilbao to prevent them from being harmed by Anarchists, and said that if the faction tries to obstruct them, they will open fire to stop them. In addition, planes belonging to the National Army recently dropped leaflets into the city, stating that the National Army will temporarily stop its attack to wait for the Basque Nationalist Party in the city to stop the actions of the Anarchists and to prevent San Sebastian and Irun from suffering the same disaster. (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>San Sebastian: A special dispatch from this newspaper's interviewer, San Sebastian's two-car positions have not changed much in the past three days. A detachment of the National Army attacking Lentoria City has arrived outside the city and surrounded it. The highways around San Sebastian are controlled by the National Army, and machine guns are set up on the heights near the port of Pasajes and Ancho. The National Army is now attacking in two directions. One route has reached Ancho City, only four kilometers away from San Sebastian, and the other route has reached Haynani City, about nine kilometers away from San Sebastian. The government troops are now advancing towards Tolosa City (southwest of San Sebastian). (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>Saint-Jean-de-Luz, France: A special dispatch from this newspaper's interviewer, the National Army has now arrived three kilometers outside San Sebastian. The residents in the city are in extreme panic. Although the shops were still barely open this morning, all goods were sold at reduced prices. Even luxury goods such as jewelry, cameras, and radios could be purchased for a few cents. The market price of the Spanish currency, the Peseta, has fallen by 20% compared to before. The Basque Nationalist Party is the most powerful in the city, but its attitude is ambiguous. It is still hesitant whether it will support the government or surrender to the National Army. Although the party has requested General Mula, the commander of the Northern Route of the National Army, not to destroy the city, Mula recently replied that if some of the party members still support the government troops, the National Army authorities will never negotiate with them. Another column of the National Army is now attacking Lentoria City. The sound of artillery heard here this morning was very clear. If there are no unexpected changes, the city will undoubtedly fall today. (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>Hendaye: The Spanish rebels claim to have occupied San Sebastian, a famous resort in the north. However, it is reported that the area is still in the hands of the government troops. The rebel army is now five to ten miles from the town, advancing from two sides. One column is advancing from Irún, Fontarrabie and Guadalupe in the east and has reached Interia and Pasajes. The other two columns are advancing from the southwest, hoping to cut off the road to Bilbao and have reached Pasajes. However, the railway from San Sebastian to Bilbao is still running as usual. The armed garrison in San Sebastian totals 14,000 men, but the strength of the front line is feared to be less than 4,000 men. At the same time, internal strife within the garrison is reported. It is said that extremist Anarchists attempted to burn down important buildings in the area. The authorities selected 200 members of the militia to monitor their actions, resulting in a struggle between the two sides in which the militia killed four Anarchists. Last night, two German torpedo boats sailed from San Sebastian and Bilbao to Saint-Jean-de-Luz on the Spanish-French border, carrying 120 refugees, including British expatriates and the famous Spanish football coach, Mr. Granville. According to Mr. Granville, he believes that a civil war has indeed broken out in Spain, but Catalonia will continue to engage in football competitions. (Reuters News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>Irun Gradually Returns to Normal</h3>
<p>Hendaye: Irun, which was besieged for a long time and occupied by the rebel army a few days ago, is now rapidly returning to normal. Barbers were seen setting up chairs in the streets full of rubble to cut hair for people, and beautiful girls in fashionable clothes could be seen strolling on the streets at any time. Red-capped soldiers from the rebel army were everywhere. However, Moroccan soldiers and foreign legionnaires have all been sent to San Sebastian. The fishermen in Fontarabie have all resumed their old fishing business, and their wives and daughters are also selling fish in the seaside market. Some tourists from Navarre visited the war ruins here. Soldiers and laborers were busy filling trenches, repairing roads and bridges. However, their work was often disrupted by government planes that came to bomb the area from time to time. The first thing the rebel army did after occupying Irún was to rebury the bodies of the victims who were taken as hostages. According to the hostages who escaped the tiger's mouth, before the government troops left the city, hostages were executed almost every hour. It is said that more than 200 hostages were imprisoned in a medieval dungeon, where the cells were very small, with each cell only six square feet in area. (Reuters News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>Portuguese Cabinet Decides to Strictly Punish the Mutinying Sailors; State of Alert Lifted</h3>
<p>Lisbon: An emergency cabinet meeting decided to take strict measures to deal with the mutiny of the two warships on Monday. It was resolved that the sailors of the two mutinying warships, regardless of whether they had participated in the rebellion, would all be dismissed, as would the officers and non-commissioned officers.

<h3>Guangzhou Premier's Revolutionary Commemoration Meeting Chairman Chiang's Speech (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) "China has been weak to the extreme. Above, there is perfunctory inaction and embellishment of emptiness. Below, there is ignorance and few can think long-term. A dignified China is looked down upon by the great powers, and a flourishing civilization is despised by foreign races. People with lofty ideals cannot but feel heartbroken. With a population of 400 million and vast lands of tens of thousands of miles, we should rise up with determination and be invincible in the world. However, due to the corruption of the political system, the court sells titles and offices, and the government plunders and exploits the people more violently than tigers and wolves. Bandits are rampant, and famine is rampant, with starving people everywhere. The people cannot live. Alas, how tragic! Now, strong neighbors are surrounding us, watching us like tigers and eagles, coveting the wealth of our Chinese minerals and the abundance of our products. Piecemeal encroachment has already been seen in succession, and the dismemberment and division of the country are truly worrying at present. Alas, how dangerous! People with a sense of responsibility cannot help but cry out loudly to save the people from fire and water and to support the collapsing building, so that our children and grandchildren may be spared from being slaves to other races. Therefore, we have gathered people with lofty ideals to revive China, and we have worked together with virtuous and talented people. I urge all comrades to encourage each other." After reading the declaration and various articles of association of the Revive China Society, we can know that the Premier at that time led a group of martyrs to launch a revolution at the cost of everything in order to overthrow the Manchus and save the 400 million compatriots from deep water and fire, and to revive the nation from humiliation, danger, and destruction. In order to achieve this goal, we must gather a group of people with lofty ideals, establish a common and consistent belief, and agree to abide by the discipline, succeed in a strong revolutionary organization, so that all comrades can unify their will, unite their spirit, concentrate their strength, and obey orders. Under the personal command of the Premier, we will sacrifice and struggle to restore China, establish a republic, implement our doctrine, and complete the revolution. Because of this organization, everyone was able to carry forward the spirit of "sharing life and death and sharing weal and woe" and "succeeding or dying for the cause" in the year of Yimao and launched the first revolution in Guangzhou. The Premier and the martyrs' hard work and difficult struggle should be emulated by our surviving comrades, especially in Guangdong, where the martyrs Lu (Haodong), Cheng (Kuiguang), Zhu (Guiquan), and Qiu (Si) died. How should we work hard to carry on the past and open up the future, and carry it forward? Especially Lu Haodong, the first martyr who sacrificed for the country, the nation, and the doctrine, when he was arrested and imprisoned, no matter how severely the Qing officials tortured him, he was always unwilling to confess a comrade or an organization. In the confession he wrote before calmly dying for the cause, he solemnly expounded the great righteousness of the revolution. Among them, there are a few sentences that our comrades should still firmly believe in, that is, "Only by abolishing the Manchu Qing can we restore the Han nationality. Only by eliminating the traitors can we abolish the Manchu Qing." The situation at that time was really like this. To revive China, we must overthrow the Manchu Qing. To eliminate the Manchu Qing, we must eliminate the traitors. Now, on the one hand, our country is encountering unprecedented national difficulties. On the other hand, the foundation of domestic political and economic construction has not yet been consolidated. At the same time, the general public still lacks a sense of national consciousness and national awareness. Some people are even willing to be traitors and work for the tiger. I don't know that the environment we are in now is still as bad as before, but the dangers we encounter are many times more serious. If our comrades in the party, government, military, and academia, and all compatriots across the country, cannot inherit the revolutionary spirit of the Premier and the martyrs at this time of crisis and survival, if everyone does not distinguish between regions, work together with one heart and one mind, unite sincerely, and struggle together to build the country and revive the nation, then we will not only be ashamed of the Premier and the martyrs, but also our children and grandchildren will be slaves and animals to others when the country is destroyed and the race is exterminated in the future. In this way, we will be the sinners of the country and the nation for all time. Therefore, when we commemorate the Premier's first decision to launch the revolution today, we must especially remember the tragic management and difficult struggle of the Premier and the martyrs for the country and the nation at that time. Everyone should unite in spirit and struggle and sacrifice for the entire country and nation in order to fulfill the responsibilities of our younger comrades. Everyone must also know that since the Premier first initiated the revolution, our Premier has gone through countless hardships and difficulties and spent a lot of effort. Our martyrs have sacrificed countless heads and blood before they were able to overthrow the Manchu Qing, establish the Republic of China, remove obstacles to the revolution, and create the current foundation for the revolution. Now that we have this foundation and a consolidated revolutionary regime, we can freely decide all plans for saving the country and building the country, and we can freely exercise our powers to promote all kinds of work. This is the most rare and good opportunity for our revolutionary nation-building. Now that we have this opportunity, if we still cannot seize the opportunity to develop and thoroughly reform from all aspects of party affairs, politics, military affairs, economy, and education, and strive to build to realize our doctrine and complete the revolution, then if we miss this opportunity, the country will be destroyed and future generations will never get a chance to turn over. Everyone must also know that the reason why the Premier was determined to launch the revolution and overthrow the Manchu Qing was because the Qing court's politics were corrupt, as stated in the declaration of the Revive China Society, "Politics are not reformed, the system is corrupted, the court sells titles and offices, bribery is rampant, the government plunders and exploits the people more violently than tigers and wolves, bandits are rampant, famine is rampant, with starving people everywhere. The people cannot live." Now that we have assumed the entire responsibility of governing and building the country, we must uphold the revolutionary spirit of the Premier and the martyrs and thoroughly eradicate all the bad habits and corrupt phenomena in the current political system, such as corruption, bribery, perfunctory inaction, embellishment of emptiness, ignorance, and forgetting the big picture for the small. We must strive to reform politics, build a clean and capable government, and promote the construction of all aspects of politics, economy, military affairs, education, and culture. We must transform the people into customs, enrich the country and strengthen the military, and complete the great cause of revolutionary nation-building in order to realize the wishes of the Premier and the martyrs and comfort the spirits of the Premier and the martyrs in heaven. If we still cannot promptly develop the revolutionary spirit and strive to complete the revolutionary cause, and we are still as corrupt as the former Qing government, and a kind of昏庸 still leads to "starving people everywhere. The people cannot live," then others will rise up and revolt against us, and we will be the continuation of the亡淸. Therefore, now is the most critical moment for the success or failure of the revolution and the rise and fall of the country. I hope that comrades from all walks of life in the party, government, and military, especially comrades and compatriots in Guangdong, the birthplace of the revolution, will especially know the difficulties of the pioneers in starting their business and the importance of the responsibilities we now shoulder. Everyone must work together with one heart and strive to build Guangdong into a model province of the Three People's Principles in order to consolidate the foundation of the revolution and complete the great cause of reviving the nation.

<h3>Ma Yinchu Talks About Active Rural Finance</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Yinchu answered reporters' questions on the 10th. The Agricultural Development Bureau's plan to commercialize agricultural products and securitize commodities is indeed an important plan to activate rural finance. However, banks are setting up branches in the interior to absorb rural funds, and they should still lend to rural areas and not concentrate in urban areas, so as to avoid this coming and that going. Rural finance is still dull as before. The successive inter-provincial trade in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong provinces is also a different highlight for the future of the rural economy. I hope that other provinces will follow suit. (Central News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Yinchu's foot injury has not fully recovered. He is continuing to write "China's Economic Policy" while leaning on the couch. When someone came to visit, Ma said that the success of our country's monetary policy in less than a year is really amazing. With the initial unification of China's internal affairs and the lack of a foundation for industry and commerce, such success is beyond the expectations of the general economic circles in the central government. The success of China's monetary policy is actually faster than that of the United Kingdom and better than that of the United States. The environment in developed European and American countries is better than that of our country, but the success of monetary policy also takes considerable time and effort. Since the implementation of our country's monetary policy, industry and commerce have recovered, rural areas have been revived, prices have been stabilized, and foreign exchange has been stable. These are all hard evidence of success. Regarding the revision of the Chamber of Commerce Law, Ma said that the draft has not yet reached the Legislative Yuan. His personal opinion is generally sympathetic to changing the organization of trade associations and supports dividing them into three categories: industrial, commercial, and export, and unifying the industrial and commercial industries under the Chamber of Commerce.

<h3>Guangdong Southern Gui Army Enters Huaxian County, County Government and Party Headquarters Move to Meilu, Former 19th Route Army Troops Respond in Southern Guangdong, Gui Army Hastily Builds Defensive Works on Guangxi Border</h3>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence: In recent days, amidst voices for peaceful negotiation in Guangxi, military actions by all parties have not ceased. After the Gui Army units led by Weng Zhaoyuan and others entered southern Guangdong Province, they have been continuously purchasing large quantities of salt, kerosene, and general merchandise in Beihai and other places and transporting them to Guangxi. The county magistrates of counties under the jurisdiction of Qin, Lian, Gao, and Lei have all left their posts. However, the Gui Army is making efforts to keep the staff of various agencies working as usual, and fortunately, archives and files have been preserved, preventing their loss. The tax collection agencies are being managed by personnel dispatched by the Gui Army. As for gambling taxes, gambling merchants in Beihai are paying 100 yuan daily to serve as military expenses. Since arriving in southern Guangdong, Weng Zhaokun has been actively establishing relations with all sectors of society, not interfering in various matters, and only recruiting old troops for military organization with great enthusiasm. The Beihai coastline and nearby mountains are extremely busy with the deployment of defensive works. After the county magistrate of Hepu County abandoned his post and fled, the local self-government organization elected a former county councilor, Mr. Lin, as the temporary county magistrate to temporarily manage county affairs. Public security in the Beihai and Hepu areas is still good, but most wealthy people have moved away. At the beginning of the month, Cai Tingkai personally inspected the defense in southern Guangdong, and former troops of the 19th Route Army flocked to join. Wang Zhisheng, director of the Xuwen military reclamation area, has recently recruited a unit of soldiers to join. Since entering Lianjiang, Weng Zhaoyuan's division has been replenishing its forces daily, and its momentum is growing. Subsequently, as there were no troops stationed in Huazhou, a large number of vehicles were hired the day before yesterday afternoon to transport the troops to Huaxian County, arriving the next morning. County Magistrate Liang of Huaxian, carrying important county government documents, fled to Meilu City, and personnel from the county party headquarters and other agencies also moved to Meilu one after another, temporarily using the Jianjiang Hotel in the city as a temporary office location. County Magistrate Liang and the two executive committee members of the county party, Mr. Chen, urgently telegraphed the provincial government in Meilu to report the Gui Army's entry into Huaxian County. It is noted that Huaxian is the gateway to Gaozhou and Meilu City in southern Guangdong, and Meilu City is the thoroughfare to Yangjiang. Huaxian is only 72 li from Meilu, a distance that can be reached from morning to evening. From Meilu to Shuidong is also only 60 li, and Shuidong is a large port for going out to sea. If Shuidong is lost, Yangjiang City will be threatened. Therefore, the hearts of the people in Meilu have been agitated in recent days. After the 5th, the headquarters of the 4th Route Army of Guangdong has transferred a brigade of a certain division to Meilu for deployment. Since Weng's division arrived in Huaxian, troops from Guangxi Province have continued to arrive in the areas of Bienan, Bobai, Xingye, and Yongchun on the border between Guangdong and Guangxi, deploying defensive works such as digging trenches and building bunkers, without the slightest relaxation. The river surface of Dahe Jilongzhou in Wuzhou was used by the city defense commander yesterday to conduct water mine demonstrations, and the sound was loud. Although the public was notified in advance, residents who witnessed this situation were worried that war would be imminent. Sandbags and barbed wire fences are spread throughout Wuzhou, creating a grim scene. Outside the city, on Baiyun Mountain, Lion Mountain, and the Butterfly Ridge of Sanjiaozui, construction work is being carried out overnight, and the lights are as bright as day. Large cannons are installed in the bunkers along the Dahe River to control waterway traffic, and water is blocked on both banks of the Dahe River to form ponds for military use. In recent days, although negotiations have been ongoing in Nanning, the Gui Army has not for a moment forgotten to deploy military affairs. (8th)</p>
<h3>Various Sections of the Yellow River in Shandong Province Report Emergencies, Luokou Water Level Breaks Highest Record</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The floodwaters from Shaanxi Province are gradually flowing into the sea. The upper reaches of the Yellow River in Shandong Province, at Lisheng Tun, have started to see a drop in the water level to 58 meters. The middle and lower reaches, however, are currently experiencing a surge. The water level at Luokou at 2 p.m. today was 31.05 meters, an increase of 2.2 cun compared to the morning, which is the highest record in three years. Zhang Lianjia, the director of the River Affairs Bureau, upon receiving reports of tight construction conditions in various sections, telegraphed the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission in Kaifeng in alarm. The telegram reads as follows:</p>
<p>(Omissions) In recent days, the river water has risen sharply. The county magistrates of Dong'a and Puyang, the chief of the upstream general section, and the chiefs of the south first, south second, north fourth, and north fifth sections, Yu Qijia et al., have successively telegraphed, stating that the people's embankment in Dong'a, from Niu Tun westward, passing through Wei Shan, Fan Po, Wang Po, etc., is thin and weak, with the rapid flow directly impacting, and conditions becoming increasingly precarious. At the Liuyuan water bend embankment in Puyang County, several dozen li of dangerous works, the entrance to the 31st dam, and the inside of the second protective bank have been scoured by two to three chi. The closing bank of the 32nd dam has also been scoured by two to three chi. At the Sun Lou section of the south first section, the Leikou of the fourth dam, and the stone bank of the ninth protective bank have all been flooded. At the Xinzhuang first dam, the bottom has collapsed for a length of eight chi. At the Yangzhuang section of the south second section, the lower corner of the 16th stone protective bank has been scoured for a length of 1 zhang and 5 chi. The Kai protective bank of the Yangshi Daokou sixth protective bank has been scoured by the surrounding flow. At the Longwang Temple Zhang Xinzhuang dams of the north fourth section, all have been flooded. At the small Gejia third stone dam, Zhao Jia dam, and the upper corner of the 23rd stone dam of the north fifth section, each has been scoured by more than 1 zhang. Moreover, the roots of the 25th and 27th willow dams have also been scoured by eight to nine zhang or more. Having received these reports, in addition to having telegraphed instructions to use willow, stone, and sandbags according to the project conditions and to supervise the soldiers and laborers to be vigilant and patrol all night without any negligence, I am respectfully reporting this matter by telegram. Shandong River Affairs Bureau Director Wang Kairu respectfully kowtows.</p>
<h3>Knife-Wielding Bandits Besiege the Third District Office in Datian County, Fujian Province; Cause is Forced Assessment of Donations</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The folk in Datian County have a secret organization called the "Big Knife Society." This spring, the bandit leader Chen Chengyong led over a thousand members to attack the county seat, but they were defeated by the 26th Brigade of the garrison. Chen was killed by a bullet, and the members scattered, but many lurked in the Taoyuan area of the Third District. On August 28, the Big Knife Society suddenly rose again, gathering over 700 members, each wielding knives and spears, and entered Taoyuan Town, besieging the Third District Office. Stationed in Taoyuan was a company of about 100 men from the newly recruited 11th Security Regiment under Zhang Kewu, who lined up to wait. When they approached, they opened fire. The members retreated and advanced repeatedly, holding out for the whole day, and were eventually defeated by the army. Seventeen bandits were killed and many more were injured. However, although the bandits were defeated, some are still gathering in various villages, which has caused panic among the people, and Tiancheng has suddenly entered a state of martial law. As for the resurgence of the Big Knife Society, it is because Datian is located at the intersection of the north and south of Fujian Province, in the hinterland, with closed transportation and poor land and people. The people's knowledge is particularly ignorant and backward. Recently, due to the management of baojia and the strong-arm team, the expenses are taken from the people at each level from the district to the joint bao and the baojia. In addition, to build roads, establish middle schools, and provide compensation to deceased civil servants, each household should pay a donation of more than one yuan per month. Since Datian has no production at all and the people's livelihood is difficult, it is difficult to cope with each assessment. If the district administrators have no funds, they send teams to urge them. Those who are too poor to pay are also troubled by the army's visits, so in addition to the donation, they must also pay for the food and wages of the visiting soldiers. Moreover, most of those who serve as baojia heads are local gentry or intellectuals, with superior status in the village, and can avoid bearing the burden of various donations themselves. Therefore, all donations are borne by the lower-level poor people, which leads to widespread resentment. Moreover, with bandits harassing everywhere, the people are even more miserable. Members of the Big Knife Society seized the opportunity to promote their主張, which is to oppose assessments and eliminate bandits. Those who follow them will have a day to escape from suffering. Therefore, the simple-minded villagers are easily deceived and blindly follow, and secretly gather, which led to the gathering in Taoyuan to besiege the district office on August 28.

<h3>Fujian Construction Department to Improve Tea and Porcelain Industries</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Tea is the most important special product of Fujian Province. However, in recent years, except for the tea produced in a few western counties (northern Fujian), which still has considerable sales due to its special quality, the black tea products of the northern counties (eastern Fujian) are inferior to Qihong in the country, and it is difficult to compete with the tea of India, Ceylon, Java, and other countries in the world market. As for scented tea, it is also gradually being attacked by foreign tea in the northern provinces of China, and sales are gradually decreasing. In order to improve the tea industry, the Fujian Construction Department established a tea experiment farm in Shekou County, Fu'an County, in 1934 to guide farmers in eastern Fujian to improve tea planting and tea making methods. In 1935, the First Tea Warehouse was established in Taijiang, Fuzhou, to manage export tea. However, at that time, due to the urgency of time and insufficient preparation, the warehouse business was contracted to merchants, and all the accumulated problems were not completely eliminated. In 1936, it was all taken back and reorganized, and the Tea Warehouse Management Office was established in the provincial capital, and the Tea Warehouse Branch was established in Saiqi, Fu'an, and Sandu, Ningde, to centrally manage the tea leaves transported from the eastern Fujian counties with the highest output. The management methods are: (1) Order all tea boats to berth at the wharf, and tea pieces should be directly put into the warehouse as much as possible; (2) Strictly crack down on tea theft; (3) Organize tea transportation, and advance customs duties on behalf of shipping companies; (4) Introduce tea merchants to banks for credit overdrafts with low-interest loans. After this year's reorganization, the tea volume has increased. Last year, the total output of red and green tea in the eastern Fujian counties was more than 156,000 boxes. As of the end of August this year, the output of green tea in the northern provinces reached more than 129,700 boxes, and the output of black tea reached more than 91,100 boxes. Compared with last year, black tea has increased by more than 29,600 boxes, and green tea has increased by more than 33,400 boxes. The industries are booming, which is a good sign for the future of Fujian tea.</p>
<p>Porcelain is also a special product of Fujian Province. Dehua in southern Fujian, Ningde in eastern Fujian, and Minqing in northern Fujian all have production. However, due to the imperfect manufacturing methods, sales have declined day by day. In order to improve the porcelain industry in the province, the Construction Department specially established various research and experimental institutions in important porcelain producing areas of the province last year to handle guidance and improvement affairs. The products produced have been considerably improved. Recently, it was decided to hold a Fujian Porcelain Appraisal Conference in the provincial capital in October this year, and a reference department will be set up to solicit porcelain products produced in various parts of the province, porcelain products collected privately, and various products from foreign provinces and countries, for display and appraisal, to achieve the purpose of improvement. All porcelain producing counties in the province have been ordered by the Construction Department to solicit separately from their respective county governments. Other porcelain manufacturing and sales manufacturers in the provincial capital and porcelain products collected privately have been entrusted to the Provincial National Products Exhibition Hall and the National Products Promotion Association to be widely collected and sent to the Construction Department for counting and receipt before September 20, and delivered for display. During the meeting period, the exhibitors are also allowed to select products to participate in the competition or entrust the appraisal conference to sell them on their behalf. If the porcelain products selected are considered excellent by the appraisal conference, the Construction Department will submit a report to the provincial government to give commendations to show encouragement.</p>

<p>Li Zhankui, 56 years old, who used to be a patrol officer in the first district of the Water Public Security Bureau, opened a sesame cake shop outside the Changmenwai Main Street to make a living after being laid off two years ago. However, Li Zhankui was not an expert in this field, and his work was taken over by his nephew Shao Kui. Recently, due to the sluggish business, the losses were quite large, and his nephew Li Shao Kui suddenly left, which caused Li Zhankui to develop the idea of ​​being tired of the world. On the afternoon of the 9th, at about 4 o'clock, he took a sharp blade and stabbed himself twice in the groin, causing serious injuries. He fell in a pool of blood and soon died from his injuries.

Although the soldiers did not carry guns, they carried bayonets, iron rulers, wooden sticks, and other weapons, and some even rushed into the restaurant opposite to take out long benches to use as weapons, resulting in huge losses. The four injured people were sent to the county hospital. One side reported to the Public Security Bureau for investigation, but County Magistrate Chen Fu, who also served as the brigade commander, was in the province and could not handle the matter that night, allowing the riotous soldiers to play the flute and leave in formation. That night, the newspaper was unable to work due to the chaos of the miscellaneous items, and publication was temporarily suspended the next morning. At this moment, other newspapers in this area, such as the Xinsheng Daily, Qin Daily, Meiri Xinwen, Yi Daily, Chao Daily, and Social Life, held an emergency meeting on the morning of the 10th to first request the Second District Security Command to send personnel to investigate and deal with the matter seriously. As for the cause of the riot by the security soldiers, it was because the newspaper published an article on the 7th entitled "Protecting Prostitutes," which involved the soldiers. After negotiations and corrections, they were still dissatisfied, which led to this action.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Residents Request Widening of Streets</h3>
<p>Zhang Yulin, director of the local Construction Bureau, originally planned to widen the streets from Guanggiao Bridge to Shengxiang Bridge, from Shengxiang Bridge to the North City Gate, and from North Diao Bridge to Lianrong Bridge, and to demolish the Yuecheng outside the North Gate. The plan was incorporated into the construction plan for 1936 and submitted to the Construction Committee for discussion. At that time, due to the construction of rural roads and the issuance of land prices, the expenses were large, and the original construction funds were insufficient, so it was decided to postpone it. However, Director Zhang repeatedly expressed his hope that the shops in the section would raise funds automatically. Yesterday (10th), more than 40 shops in the Datieqiao Street section, such as Tang Ruicheng, Maolun, Xieshengyong, Jiulun, and Zhongxi Pharmacy, were willing to raise funds automatically and planned to widen the street from Shengxiang Bridge to the North City Gate first, and then demolish the Yuecheng outside the North Gate and then gradually implement it to North Main Street. A few representatives were elected to meet with Director Zhang and requested to start the work to improve the appearance of the city and benefit commercial transportation.</p>
<h3>New Developments in Abortion Case</h3>
<p>Xu Yuanzhen, the eldest daughter of Xu Shaotang, the owner of the old Xu Erquan basket sieve wine bag shop at No. 24 Dashiqiao Street in the city, died suddenly on the afternoon of the 31st of last month. According to her family, Yuanzhen committed suicide by taking poison, but outsiders mostly said that she was killed. Later, after the court appointed an investigating police officer to go to the scene with Shen, the examining officer, to inspect the body, it was found that Yuanzhen's abdomen was swollen and her vagina was bleeding. According to the report of the Shen examiner, the result of the examination was that she died of poisoning, but Qian Chengjun, the chief prosecutor, found that Xu Yuanzhen's death had the suspicion of abortion, so he filed a complaint according to law. Yesterday, he ordered the deceased's mother, Xu Wang, to be summoned for interrogation, which lasted for a long time, and ordered her to be sent back. At the same time, he strictly investigated the midwife who performed the abortion for Xu Yuanzhen and other details for review and handling.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Taixian Reporter Candidates</h3>
<p>Taixian news reporters elected Bao Mingshu, Ma Yinliang, Yan Duhe, Sun Dexian, Zou Hangnan, Cao Haibin, and Qian Cangshuo, etc., eleven people with the most votes as candidates for National Assembly representative.</p>
<p>A wooden raft was parked in the Neihe River of Dutian Temple in Yiling, blocking the water surface. On the morning of the 7th, a wheat boat with the surname Wang, carrying more than 200 dan of wheat, was transported from Bengbu to Nantong. It collided with the wooden raft and sank into the water immediately. All the crew members were rescued by people and were fortunately spared.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Extension of Repayment Period for Industrial Revitalization Loan</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Department of Finance had borrowed 720,000 yuan from the China, Jiaotong, Xingye, Yanye, and Continental Banks in Hangzhou last year for industrial revitalization, with a term of one year, and the collateral was Zhejiang local public bonds. Now that the repayment period is approaching, the Department of Finance has negotiated with the lending banks to extend the repayment period by six months, and the collateral will be replaced with 1,496,000 yuan of newly issued second-class public bonds. The monthly interest rate remains at one point.</p>
<h3>Arctic Ocean: The Success of an Uninterrupted 10,000-Kilometer Flight (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Mai Yi</p>
<p>Amidst cloud-covered skies, incessant wind and rain, and the obstructions of ice and snow, the heroic Soviet aviators Chkalov, Baidukov, and Belyakov finally completed their uninterrupted 10,000-kilometer long-distance flight across the Arctic region. The aircraft, a Soviet-made "An125," took off on July 20th from an airfield near Moscow, passing over the Barents Sea, Franz Josef Land, Severnaya Zemlya, and 　Ruba Valoske in Kamchatka, and landed near Nikolaevsk (i.e., Temple Street) at around 1:45 PM on the 23rd. The total distance was three thousand seven hundred and four kilometers. The difficulties encountered along the way were truly insurmountable. Chkalov's account of the flight is very moving, and is translated below:</p>
<p>As I reflect on the entire course of our flight, the first thing I remember is the surge of courage the moment we departed from the airfield near Moscow.</p>
<p>Everything was ready. We were sitting in the cockpit, the engine whirring. Stoman, the engineer who oversaw the construction of the "An125," raised his hand to signal that we should take off. I turned back in the cockpit and signaled to Baidukov and Belyakov:</p>
<p>"Is everything alright?"</p>
<p>"Everything's alright."</p>
<p>I opened the throttle, and the plane began to slide forward, speeding along the cement runway. A large crowd of well-wishers stood in the center of the two-kilometer-long path. The plane's speed increased, leaving them behind. I waved to them, watching them wriggle and turn. But no one could accurately predict when the plane would leave the ground, except for Tupolyev, who stood in exactly the right spot – right where the plane lifted off from the earth. I saw Tupolyev and waved to him.</p>
<p>After making a small circle, I turned the nose of the plane northward. I piloted for the first few hours of the flight. As I steered, I said to Belyakov:</p>
<p>"Sleep, conserve your energy."</p>
<p>But who could sleep when we had just started flying like this! The excitement of the departure made it impossible for my friend to close his eyes.</p>
<p>The plane entered the clouds, constantly heading north. As we reached higher altitudes, the clouds became denser, but we flew higher and higher. After about nine hours, we reached the Barents Sea.</p>
<p>We were over the sea, soaring through a relatively clear gap in the clouds, and we could clearly see small, broken pieces of ice floes in the sea. Here, we increased our altitude even further… thirty meters, three thousand five hundred meters, continuing forward through the clouds. Now, Baidukov took over piloting. Oh, I can’t describe it! I replaced Baidukov before reaching Victoria Island, and at that time, I gave him an order:</p>
<p>"You must sleep, you must, Baidukov."</p>
<p>I continued to pilot the plane northward as before. After some distance, Rivikov told me that we should change direction – we had to turn towards Franz Josef Land. We had already been flying for ten hours. Unexpectedly, the clouds suddenly dispersed, and I saw the land beneath the plane. I couldn't help but shout to my companions:</p>
<p>"Franz Josef Land! Look, Franz Josef Land is here!"</p>
<p>We took photos. The solemnity and beauty of Franz Josef Land truly amazed us; this tranquil natural scene – the great Arctic – certainly aroused a lot of interest in us. We surveyed the area for a long time until the fog obscured our vision.</p>
<p>Next, we flew towards Severnaya Zemlya. Before reaching this place, I asked Baidukov to take over piloting; I decided to rest. I slept on top of the oil tank, covered with a leather sleeping mat, intending to sleep soundly. But the weather was very cold, and I couldn't sleep deeply, only dozing off.</p>
<p>When I got up and looked around, it was raining, and the sky was covered with thick clouds. We had clouds above us, and we had clouds below us! Thus, we could only rely on experience for blind flight. The excellent pilot Baidukov was simply groping in the dark, but surprisingly, he still handled it very skillfully. On the morning of July 21st, we reached Severnaya Zemlya. We always wandered at 80 degrees North latitude. We were fortunate to catch a glimpse of the outlines of several islands through the only gaps in the clouds. Later, we flew towards the mainland, the nose of the plane pointing towards Notvik and Tiksi Bay. The weather conditions were very bad. We struggled through thick, dense clouds and fierce cyclones before reaching Khatanga Bay.</p>
<p>From here, we flew to the Olenek River, then to the Lena River, and after crossing the Lena River, turned towards Tiksi Bay. About sixteen to twenty kilometers away from Tiksi Bay, we changed course to fly to Petropavlovsk in Kamchatka, crossing many mountain ranges of Yakutsk.</p>
<p>We were flying at an altitude of four thousand to four thousand seven hundred meters. The atmosphere gradually thinned, making breathing difficult in the high altitude. However, we still didn't put on our oxygen masks because we calculated that the oxygen we carried was only enough for six hours of flight. We had to save it until flying on the route from Petropavlovsk to the mainland across the Sea of Okhotsk.</p>

<p>Remarks Before Departure</p>
<p>Before his departure, Ambassador Guillaume told the New Sound News Agency reporter at the port, "I have stayed in China for six and a half years (previously incorrectly reported as three and a half years). This time, I am returning to my country. Whether I will come to China again depends on the orders of the government, which has not yet been decided. I have traveled to various places before and have been deeply impressed. I feel that your country has made a lot of progress, especially in terms of construction. I am very reluctant to leave China this time." When Mr. Guillaume said this, the reporter asked about the upgrading of the Chinese and Belgian envoys. He replied, "This matter has not been decided yet. I have not had any contact with your country. Perhaps the Chinese Ambassador to Belgium, Mr. Zhu (Hexiang), has had contact here, but I don't know. However, this matter is very likely to be realized." The reporter then asked about the Belgian loan for the Longhai Railway. Ambassador Guillaume said, "This is a long-standing issue that has been completely resolved about a month ago. As for the details of the resolution, I regret that I cannot tell you." Ambassador Guillaume also stated that after his departure, the embassy's affairs will be temporarily handled by Mr. Tanerfu. The trip to the Dutch East Indies is purely for travel. He will stay there for a few days and then transfer to another ship to return to Europe.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Plans to Establish County and Township Banks; Capital of 6 Million Yuan; To Be Realized Within This Year</h3>

<h3>Western Newspaper Reports that Sino-French Airmail Must Have Sufficient Airmail Stamps and Specify Routing via Hanoi</h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, starting from the beginning of September, there will be airmail transported from Shanghai to Guangzhou every week. Starting from the 9th, the direct air route to France will also be started. The method is that on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, the aircraft of China National Aviation Corporation will transport the mail from Shanghai to Guangzhou, then Southwest Aviation Corporation will transport it from Guangzhou to Hanoi, and then Air France will transport it from Hanoi to France. This airmail service was started a few months ago, but was suspended due to a dispute between China National Aviation Corporation and Southwest Aviation Corporation over which party's aircraft should transport the mail from Guangzhou to Hanoi, and then the Guangdong-Guangxi incident. Yesterday, Huang, Deputy Postal Director of the Maritime District, told the North China Daily News representative that this accident no longer exists, so the air transport will be resumed from today. Recently, some people have criticized that the mail between Guangzhou and Hanoi is often transported by ship. This is indeed the case, but it is due to the bad weather. One aircraft was delayed and could not connect with another aircraft that was scheduled to depart. Rather than waiting for two days for the next aircraft to arrive, it is better to hand it over to the ship for transportation as soon as possible, but this is only done occasionally. The new business allows French postal letters to be transported to Shanghai within twelve days. All airmail destined for France or European cities, whether letters, postcards, or printed matter (including newspapers), must pay an additional 6.5 cents for every five centimeters in addition to the usual postage stamps. Those exceeding five centimeters must pay an additional 6.5 cents. However, those sent to Greece and Italy only need to pay six cents for every five centimeters. These mails must specify "Routing via Hanoi" on the surface. Mr. Huang also said that all airmail sent to Shanghai and other cities in China from foreign countries that have paid sufficient airmail postage will be transported by air, as well as mail transported by Air France or Imperial Airways to Hong Kong. Mail transported to Hong Kong will first be transported by train to Guangzhou, and then transported by aircraft of China National Aviation Corporation. As for those who only pay the airmail postage to Hanoi or Hong Kong, they will be transported by ordinary postal routes.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Opium Smokers' Registration; Registration Extended to 8:00 PM; 208 Refused</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau was ordered to conduct a general inspection of opium smokers in this city during the period, and opium smokers were allowed to apply for supplementary registration. Yesterday (the 10th) was the deadline. Except for the Lao Beimen Police Station, where there were more opium smokers and the time was slightly extended, the remaining branch bureaus and stations, in accordance with the general bureau's telephone call, uniformly closed the registration at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, and all the registered blank receipts and books were submitted to the general bureau. At the Lao Beimen Police Station, there were hundreds of people who applied for registration yesterday, which was completed at 8:00 PM. After this, the opium jail will begin. In the future, opium smokers who are arrested without a license or who are impersonating others will be sent to the jail for compulsory rehabilitation and then sentenced according to law, without any leniency.</p>
<p>It is heard that the Lao Beimen Police Station was ordered to conduct a general inspection of opium smokers. Yesterday was the deadline. Shen Zhenhua, the station chief, supervised the officers and police, and accompanied the investigators from the anti-narcotics section to go out to investigate in the territory in separate groups. It is estimated that yesterday, more than 200 opium smokers were arrested (of which 70-80% did not have a license to smoke, and the rest were impersonating, etc.). They were all taken to the station. In addition to applying for registration, the rest were all sent to the general bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador Hosts Talk with the Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to TASS News Agency, Shanghai, September 10th, Soviet Ambassador to China, Bogomolov, hosted a talk with representatives of the Chinese and foreign press in this city on a wooden morning, and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>"A few days ago, I met with Chinese newspaper reporters in Nanjing and resolutely refuted the malicious rumors of the German news agency, such as the "famine" in Ukraine, the conflict between farmers and the army, etc. The interview from Ukrainian Acting People's Commissar of Agriculture, Gukhevsky, which was published in several Chinese newspapers a few days ago, has proven with figures that these slanders are purely fabricated. I am very pleased that the Chinese newspapers published the above interview. Only one thing is true in the interview, that by the end of this year, no farmer in Ukraine will be without his own cow, which is sufficient to prove the great achievements of agricultural development and improve the living standards of the people.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, you may recall that the German news agency once spread the message that the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, Molotov, had resigned, and unfortunately, many Chinese newspapers also published it. However, Mr. Mo actually represented the Soviet government to review a parade on the Red Square after his "resignation," which is not a strange story. I must point out that the local Japanese newspapers are still echoing and continuing the anti-Soviet propaganda launched by the German news agency. In order to make this kind of false news contain local significance, they have rumored that our military attaché, Mr. Repin, "does not agree with the policy of the Soviet government and was recalled." At the same time, the press also rumored that Repin had been placed in the bottom cabin of the 'Sefuer' ship and 'escorted' to Vladivostok.</p>
<p>"However, gentlemen, now you see that the so-called 'escort' does not prevent Mr. Repin from sitting at the same table with us.</p>
<p>"The local Japanese newspapers are very unhappy about the fact that Soviet films are increasingly popular with the Chinese people, but I do not agree with this view. I think this fact is not only beneficial to the Soviet Union and China, but also has great benefits for the entire future of peace.</p>
<p>"The Soviet Union's foreign policy is entirely based on the sole desire to strengthen the peaceful relations between the Soviet Union and other countries. From this, we can understand the efforts we strive to implement this goal in all human activities.</p>
<p>"We believe that one of the main reasons for governments to trap people into war is that the people of that country fail to fully understand the feelings and thoughts of the people of neighboring countries. People will never be willing to endure war, and this fact further proves that cultural communication between the people of all countries can only further develop the friendly relations between the people, and to a certain extent, can prevent the government from organizing any war and conflict. I am personally very pleased that our cultural activities have received the support of the Chinese government and the Chinese people. "Unfortunately, I must declare that the current development of the international situation is very unfavorable. The threat of war has become increasingly urgent. One of the main reasons for this unfavorable development is undoubtedly the policies of certain countries and their governments. These policies are not based on the desire for world peace like the Soviet Union, but on attempts to expand territory and conquer other countries and peoples. Although the facts in recent years have shown the superficial success of this policy, I am convinced that it will eventually collapse, because the victory of this policy will be equivalent to the destruction of mankind.</p>
<p>"I think it is not an exaggeration to say that today's world is standing at a crossroads. One of the crossroads is the road of national narrow-mindedness, national hatred, and the self-mutilation of the people. The second is the road of promoting international coordination, fighting for peace, and fighting for the prosperity of human culture. I am convinced that after the completion of this great goal, the accompanying ones will be the unprecedented prosperity of culture and the well-being of all nations, and the achievement of this goal must be achieved by the leaders and representatives of all peoples, united and jointly fighting against those who attempt to use various ethnic and national elite 'theories' to base their inhuman activities on peace destroyers and war instigators.</p>
<h3>After the Deadline for the General Crackdown on Narcotics, Door-to-Door Spot Checks Will Begin Today; Opium Smokers without Licenses Will Be Taken to the Bureau; In the Future, They Will Be Sent to the Garrison Headquarters</h3>
<p>Since the start of the general crackdown on opium and narcotics by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, investigations have been strictly enforced. Yesterday was the deadline for the general crackdown. The bureaus and stations of the Public Security Bureau dispatched inspectors to check along the way. Opium smokers with opium faces were immediately questioned. Those who had registered and obtained a license were allowed to pass. Those who had not registered were immediately taken to the bureau to obtain a license. Those who voluntarily wished to quit were sent to drug and opium rehabilitation hospitals for treatment. From today onwards, door-to-door spot checks will be conducted. Those without licenses will be sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for punishment according to law. As for the Office of the Special Commissioner for Anti-Opium Affairs of the Military Affairs Commission stationed in Shanghai, it will be closed after Special Commissioner Ma returns to Shanghai. The Opium Smokers' Registration Guidance Office jointly operated by the Public Education Center of the Temple of Literature and the Public Security Bureau closed yesterday.</p>
<h3>Representatives to the World Power Conference: Wang Shengshan Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday; Has Already Submitted a Written Report to the Ministry of Industry</h3>

The trial took place in the Second Court. First, the presiding judge questioned the defendant about his name, age, and origin. Then, the police lawyer stood up to state the grounds for the prosecution, saying that on August 16th, Ta Kung Pao published an article titled "A Play That Cannot Be Performed." The police believed that it contained elements of inciting others to resist lawful orders and, therefore, prosecuted the defendant under Article 153, Section 2 of the Criminal Code. The judge then questioned the defendant. Mr. Zhang stated several points: (1) He is responsible for editing Ta Kung Pao; (2) Ta Kung Pao has always been extremely cautious regarding opinions and news reporting; (3) Novels and dramas published in the literary section and supplements of the newspaper are for entertainment purposes; (4) The article in question is a play script and does not incite others to commit crimes; (5) He has been frequently ill recently and may not have paid sufficient attention to the editing of the supplements. However, he did not know what specific part of the play the police lawyer claimed incited others to resist lawful orders. The judge further inquired about the source of the script. Mr. Zhang replied that it was a submission and he did not know the author's name. At this point, the debate began. The police lawyer continued to explain that the reason he believed the defendant had violated Article 153, Section 2 of the Criminal Code was due to the fact that the National Government issued a decree on maintaining friendly relations with neighboring countries on June 10th of last year. The article "A Play That Cannot Be Performed" incited emotions against the Three Northeastern Provinces and repeatedly mentioned "Manchukuo," which contradicted the decree on maintaining friendly relations. The defendant then asked the judge to allow him to state his views, roughly saying that the newspaper has always paid attention to and respected laws and regulations in its opinions and reporting regarding maintaining friendly relations with neighboring countries. However, he believed that the police lawyer's claim of violating the decree on maintaining friendly relations, based on the mention of the Three Northeastern Provinces and "Manchukuo" in the article, was a misunderstanding. He emphasized that the Republic of China has not yet abandoned the Three Northeastern Provinces as its territory, and the National Government has not recognized "Manchukuo." Therefore, it should not be considered a friendly nation as mentioned in the decree on maintaining friendly relations. He hoped that the court would understand this. Subsequently, Mr. Cao Shoulian, the defendant's defense lawyer, spoke and further clarified this point. He also explained based on the facts that the elements of legal incitement did not exist. The judge, having heard both sides' statements, declared the debate concluded and scheduled the verdict for next Thursday.</p>
<h3>More Than Eighty Labor Unions in This City Jointly Petition for Thorough Investigation of Forged Labor Organizations</h3>
<p>Ta Kung News Agency reports: More than eighty labor unions in this city, including cotton spinning and dyeing in ten districts, public transportation in six districts, silk reeling in six districts, shipbuilding in one district, soap and medicine in nine districts, papermaking in five districts, cotton spinning in five districts, water and electricity in six districts, shipbuilding in four districts, sauce making, medicine shops, military uniforms, cosmetics in one district, civilian boats in four districts, porters, newspapers, cigarette and wine making in four districts, civilian boat woodworking, candle making, cleaning in one district, elevator operators, dried ginger slices, taxi drivers, tea making in six districts, hotel medicine shops, papermaking in one district, water and electricity in one district, postal workers, postal employees, match making in five districts, cigarette making in five districts, bleaching, rubber in four districts, cotton spinning in three districts, British-owned cars, tugboats, silk reeling in four districts, and shipbuilding woodworking, have jointly petitioned the Central Party Headquarters, the Military Affairs Commission, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Military Affairs, the National Assembly Election General Office, the Ministry of Industry, and other agencies, as well as the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Public Security Bureau, and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting a thorough investigation of forged labor organizations and strict punishment of the instigators. The original text is recorded as follows: "Petition for strict investigation of the use of forged organizational names and the distribution of slanderous leaflets, and for strict punishment of the instigators to reassure the people and benefit the labor movement." It is humbly submitted that under the guidance of the Party and government agencies, the city's labor unions have been led responsibly by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. Over the past few years, they have made many contributions to the labor movement. During the period of elections for representatives to the National Assembly, it was unexpectedly discovered that an organization forged the name of the "United Office of All Trades (Unions) in Shanghai," fabricated facts, distributed leaflets, and wantonly slandered the comrades in charge of the city's labor movement. It is obvious that one or two lawless and treacherous individuals are spreading rumors to confuse the public in an attempt to disrupt the labor movement and sabotage the National Assembly elections. Their conspiracy is insidious and their behavior is contemptible. It is understood that the Shanghai Public Security Bureau has detained Jin, who distributed the leaflets, and is currently interrogating him. His background and the identity of the mastermind will undoubtedly be revealed. Because this matter concerns the disruption of the labor movement, the unions are indignant and find it difficult to remain silent. In addition to submitting separate reports to the central agencies to expose the conspiracy and deny the forged "United Office of All Trades (Unions) in Shanghai," and requesting a thorough investigation of the mastermind and severe punishment, we hereby submit this document to your (department) (government) (bureau) for review and thorough investigation according to the law in order to punish the traitors, which is for the public good. Respectfully submitted."</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves That Purchase Orders from the General Chamber of Commerce Should Be Stamped</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National General Chamber of Commerce received a reply from the Ministry of Finance, Tax Letter No. 10658, stating that the National General Chamber of Commerce's telegram dated June 9, 1936, requesting that purchase orders be exempt from stamp tax, has been noted. According to the regulations in Item 5 of the Stamp Tax Rate Table, which stipulates that receipts for goods and ledgers that are required to be stamped include all receipts, registered or unregistered, issued by shops of all kinds for the purpose of receiving goods. The remarks in the notes column, such as gift certificates, laundry tickets, and receipt books, are examples of the receipts in this item. Other receipts not listed but of the same nature should still be stamped according to the tax rate of this item. This is also clearly stipulated in Article 9 of the Implementing Rules. The receipt used by Shop A to collect goods from Shop B is used by Shop B for accounting and delivery of goods, which is the same as the case of using a receipt book to receive and deliver goods and record them. Therefore, it belongs to the nature of a receipt for goods and should be handled in accordance with the provisions of Item 5 of the tax rate table. Moreover, Article 5 of the Stamp Tax Law stipulates that tax stamps should be affixed to taxable documents before delivery or use. This purchase order becomes effective as a document when it is delivered to the other party, so it should be stamped before delivery. As for the case where the other party occasionally fails to deliver all the goods according to the order, it is another matter and does not invalidate the purchase order itself. If it is said that in this case, the purchase order is not effective and should not be stamped, then is there any reason to affix stamps after the fact if the goods are delivered according to the order? Previously, the Zhejiang Provincial General Chamber of Commerce and the Jiujiang Chamber of Commerce separately requested that these purchase orders be exempted from stamp tax, and they were rejected. Although the tax-exempt column in Item 5 of the tax rate table stipulates that "receipts under three yuan are exempt from stamping," Section 2 of Article 17 of the Stamp Tax Law stipulates that "if the amount is not specified, the tax stamp should be affixed at the highest tax rate of the type in principle." Therefore, if this purchase order does not specify the price of the goods, it should still be stamped with a two-cent tax stamp in accordance with the law. This is for your information.</p>

<h3>Christ Glory Church One-Week Anniversary</h3>

<h3>The Shanghai Real Estate Association Held a Regular Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Ways to Save the Real Estate Industry. Pu Shen, Tian Xin, and Others Discussed the Continued Decline of the Real Estate Industry and Requested an Explanation of the Resale Mortgage Right as a Remedial Measure.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association held a regular committee meeting at its location on Shanxi Road yesterday afternoon. Shen Tianxin, Wang Yiting, Shen Lianfang, and others attended. Chairman Shen Tianxin discussed the issue of property debt disputes submitted by various Shanghai district courts for valuation, and exchanged opinions on the problem of saving the declining real estate industry. However, no decisions were made. The meeting adjourned at approximately 6 PM. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency interviewed Chairman Shen Tianxin yesterday. According to Mr. Shen, the Shanghai real estate industry is suffering from the impact of the overall economic downturn. Prices have plummeted, transactions have sharply decreased, and real estate merchants are on the verge of bankruptcy. Real estate is the largest asset in circulation in the market and is closely related to all industries. If we want to revive the market, we must first make real estate liquid. Although the government and other parties have been trying to find ways to remedy the situation, such as establishing a real estate mortgage bank, the real estate industry is still in decline. In areas such as Rue du Consulat and Beijing Road, which are known to be prosperous, empty houses are common and tenants are in arrears with rent. The courts are busy handling property debt disputes. This kind of economic downturn is difficult to resolve properly in a short time. This association has requested that the Ministry of Finance ask the Ministry of Justice to explain the resale mortgage right case, which is also one way to save the real estate industry. The Silver and Money Trades Association has also agreed with the principle. After consulting with the two associations, we will submit a request to the government for an explanation to remedy the situation.</p>

<h3>### Wang Shubao, Owner of the Xiang Wu Stage, Was Accused of Murder. The Plaintiff Claims There Is Another Wang Shubao, but the Prosecutor Proves Private Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Wang Shubao, the owner of the Xiang Wu Stage, was involved in a case during the January 28th Shanghai Incident where a dismissed detective, Ji Zhongtang, was shot and killed at the Xiangyan Bridge in Hongkou. This spring, someone distributed leaflets to various agencies, claiming that Wang Shubao was involved in a love triangle with the female performer Yu Yanfang, leading to the tragedy. Now, lawyer Huang Zongqia has reached a settlement with the family of the deceased and sought a dismissal of the case. Zhang Xiaowanzi (i.e., the plaintiff), a disciple of Ji Zhongtang, allegedly obtained a bribe and made false accusations. The former Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court, Zhong Shangbin, filed a lawsuit. Judge Wu Deying repeatedly summoned and questioned witnesses. However, the family of the deceased and witnesses all stated that the person who killed Ji Zhongtang was Wang Shubao from Anhui, not Wang Shubao from Yancheng, who was summoned. This raised the issue of two Wang Shubaos. The judge ordered an investigation, which has been ongoing for some time. Now, due to a change of judges, Yu Lüde is presiding over the case. Yesterday, Judge Yu reopened the trial. Wang Shubao testified that he is 48 years old and runs the Xiang Wu Stage. During the January 28th Shanghai Incident in 1932, the theater was used as a headquarters by Japanese soldiers. He moved to the concession to live. He did not know how Ji Zhongtang was killed in the war zone, nor was he involved with any female performer. After the war ended, he returned on May 29 and was arrested by the Public Security Bureau's detective team. Later, the plaintiff, Zhang Xiaowanzi, testified to the team that the Wang Shubao who committed the murder was a small gangster, another person. Therefore, Team Leader Lu Ying released him. He is now suffering an injustice. If this were true, he would be willing to be shot. Zhang Xiaowanzi testified that he is 30 years old, from Yancheng, and Ji Zhongtang was his mentor. On May 4, 1932, at 1 PM, his mentor was shot and killed by three people in a teahouse on Tianjin Road. One of them was named Wang Shubao, who had pockmarks and a northern accent. He reported the incident to the court himself. This is not that Wang Shubao. The family of the deceased and witnesses all claimed that this was not that Wang Shubao. The judge asked how much money they received for the reconciliation in the homicide case. They answered, "None." Yu Yanfang testified that she had no illicit relationship with Wang or Ji and was being slandered. Lawyer Huang Zongqia testified that he is 38 years old, from Yancheng, and accepted 60 yuan from Ji Chenshi in March of this year to file a lawsuit against Wang Shubao. He did not ask for any money for reconciliation. Prosecutor Tang argued that Wang Shubao had privately reconciled with Ji Chenshi for 1,100 yuan. The investigation confirmed this, so he requested a judgment. The judge adjourned the debate and said that the judgment would be announced later.</p>
<h3>### Yellow Poisonous Moths Discovered Near Hongkou Park: The Moths' Yellow Powder Is Extremely Poisonous and Can Be Fatal</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily News, a Japanese person was suffering from a severe poisoning at the Komaya Hospital in Yipin Lane, Wusong Road. On the evening of the 6th, a moth landed on his chest at his residence near Jiangwan Road. When he brushed it off with his hand, he suddenly felt intense pain and itching on his chest, abdomen, limbs, and back. He rushed to the hospital for treatment. According to the Komaya doctor's diagnosis, he was attacked by a highly poisonous moth. This poisonous moth is a small, yellow, scaly moth. When touched, it releases yellow powder, which is extremely poisonous and can be deadly. In the past, Japan suffered from this disease. In the Ganghwa Island and Haeju regions of Korea, there were more than 100 patients daily. Its toxicity is more intense than any poisonous insect. Even applying ammonia to the affected area cannot neutralize the poison. The most effective treatment is to use almond oil mixed with zinc oxide powder. Residents near Hongkou Park and Jiangwan Road are in a state of panic. Windows should be closed tightly before turning on the lights at night to prevent poisonous moths from flying in.</p>
<h3>### Fang Gongpu Hired as Medical Officer by the Garrison Department</h3>
<p>Fang Gongpu, vice president of the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Science Research Association, has practiced medicine in Shanghai for many years. His medical skills are profound, and he has saved countless lives. He is also enthusiastic about community affairs and has served as a member of the Chinese Medicine Examination Committee of the Shanghai Health Bureau, an executive member of the National Medicine Association, a director of the Central National Medicine Museum, and a director of the Shanghai National Medicine Branch. Yang Xiaotian, the Commander of the Songhu Garrison, extended an invitation to Fang when he was the Director of the Security Department. Fang treated his subordinates and achieved remarkable results, which was greatly appreciated. This time, Fang has been specially hired as a medical officer of the Garrison Headquarters to protect health.</p>
<h3>### Trial of Japanese Sailor Case Scheduled for Special Hearing: Written Confessions Obtained from Four Suspects Yesterday; Court Did Not Convene Yesterday Due to Lack of Time</h3>
<p>Yang Wendao, Ye Haisheng, and Zhou Sherong were suspected of being involved in the murder of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo on Baole'an Road on November 9th of last year. The Public Concession Police filed a lawsuit with the Special First Court, which is still investigating the evidence and conducting the trial. Recently, the police obtained four more names from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau: Zhu Guisheng, Jin Daoquan, Chen Siming, and Zhang Yuhua, who are believed to be involved in the murders of Nakayama Hideo and Japanese resident Kayanari Yongzo. Zhang Yuhua was arrested for the assassination attempt on former Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei and was handed over to the First Special District Court, which approved his detention for one week. All of this has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning was the day the detention period expired. Judge Xiao Xiefei opened the Criminal Court No. 3 to hear the case. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, argued that the circumstances of the case were complex and that the time available for questioning in the morning was insufficient. He requested that the hearing be postponed for a special session. Therefore, none of the defendants were brought to court yesterday. All of the confession statements of the four defendants have been recorded and submitted to the court. Judge Xiao approved the request and announced that the hearing would be postponed to 2 PM on the 16th of this month.</p>
<h3>### Inside Story of the Suitcase Corpse Case Revealed: Two Victims Were Female Attendants at the Great World Amusement Park; Two Perpetrators Were Employees of the Fire Brigade; The Murder Was Planned After an Affair Was Exposed; Witness Lin Gendi Narrates the Scene</h3>
<p>On the 11th of last month, a large green suitcase was discovered near the Waibaidu Bridge on Suzhou Road, containing the dismembered body of a woman without a head. Despite the police's best efforts to investigate, there were no leads until recently, when Huang Fusen, Liu Zhaonian, Chen Defu, Deng Shu, and other Chinese detectives from the Hongkou Police Station arrested a Ningbo woman named Lin Gendi, age 17, who lived at No. 32 Huacheng Lane, Xinjiang Road. She was a female attendant at the No. 22 booth at the Great World Amusement Park's Dajing Troupe. She was handed over to the First Special District Court and ordered to be detained. Following Lin's confession, Shao Yu, a driver from the Xinzha Fire Brigade No. 650 (father's name: Agou, age 27, resident of No. 74 Jinlu Lane, Parker Road), and Jiang Yuantan (also known as Xiao Fujian, Xiaotuzi), a firefighter from the Central Fire Brigade No. 231 (age 24, resident of No. 4 Dada Lane, Shikuta Road, Hongkou), were arrested yesterday morning. They were sent to Criminal Court No. 3 of the Special First Court and questioned by Judge Xiao Xiefei. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that since the suitcase corpse case occurred, the female suspect, Lin Gendi, was apprehended on the 23rd of this month. At the entrance of the Tongchangxiang Cigarette Paper Shop at No. 230 Carter Road, she loudly discussed how difficult it is for women to have affairs these days. If they are not careful, they may have their heads chopped off with an axe. Yu Hanwen, a shop assistant at the cigarette paper shop, and Du Changlin, the driver of trolleybus No. 148, overheard the conversation. Police detectives learned about it and arrested Lin. Under detailed questioning, Lin stated that the body in the suitcase was indeed Caiying, a female attendant at the Yang booth at the Great World Amusement Park. Initially, she was also a female attendant at the Great World, but later moved to the Shanghai Great World Amusement Park, so she knew Caiying. In May of this year, Lin met Shao Yu while making tea. On a certain day in June, Shao took Lin Gendi to Caiying's home in a rooming house at No. 3 Cunfu Lane, Baibao Road, North Sichuan Road. Jiang Yuantan was also present. There were no unusual activities that day. On August 8th, at 8 PM, Shao's father accompanied Lin to Caiying's home, and Jiang was also present. After a while, Jiang suddenly started arguing with Caiying, accusing her of having an affair with both him and Shao. Then Jiang started arguing with Shao. They discussed that such women were easy to find, but since this was the case, they might as well kill her. Jiang then pulled out an axe from his waist (because they were both wearing uniforms, they carried the axe with them) and chopped Caiying on the neck. Lin was terrified and ran away. One day later, on the 11th, Shao and others forced Lin to go to Caiying's home, saying that Caiying had been killed. When they arrived, Caiying's body was already in the suitcase, and her head was wrapped in a white cloth and placed in a bamboo basket, which was then covered with a straw bag. Jiang carried the straw bag, and Shao carried the suitcase out of the house. They hired three rickshaws to go to the Waibaidu Bridge. Shao threw the suitcase into the English Concession's wall. Jiang took the head out of the straw bag, added a stone, and threw it into the river, sinking it to the bottom. The police arrested Shao and Jiang and found a photo of a woman at Shao's home at No. 74 Jinlu Lane, Parker Road. Lin Gendi identified the woman in the photo as Caiying, who had been killed. The fingerprints on the photo and the fingerprints of the deceased were compared and found to be generally consistent. Yu Hanwen and Du Changlin have both arrived at the court today to testify. Lin Gendi's confession was recorded and submitted to the court. It was also stated that a more detailed investigation was needed, so it was requested that Shao and Jiang be detained. Yu Hanwen and Du Changlin testified that they did indeed hear Lin Gendi say that a girlfriend of hers had been killed with an axe. Lin Gendi was then brought from the detention center to the courtroom, and Shao and Jiang were questioned separately. Lin described the events in detail, which was the same as what Zhang Shizhu had stated (omitted). The judge then brought the two suspects to the dock and informed them that Lin had confessed to the events. Shao confessed that he met Lin Gendi through a firefighter from the Central Fire Brigade No. 434 in January. Lin insisted on marrying him and had repeatedly gone to his office, so he scolded her and kicked her out. Therefore, she is now framing him. He did not commit this crime. On August 8th, he was on duty and driving for the Western supervisor, so he had no time to go out. The photo that was found was a portrait of his wife, who is currently in Tongzhou. The judge did not believe him and could summon her for questioning. Wu Yuanying stated that he did not know Caiying at all and could not have killed her. He also did not know where Caiying's home was. The judge then ordered Lin Gendi to the stand to repeat what she had said and to identify the person in the photo. Lin repeated her statement and said that the photo was definitely of Caiying. However, Shao and Jiang firmly denied it, saying that they were being falsely accused and requested a thorough investigation. Judge Xiao reviewed the confessions and announced that the case would be postponed to next week for another hearing. Shao Yugen and Jiang Qianyuantan were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>### Pan Jingui and His Brother Sue for Fraud: Hu Zhichang Found Not Guilty; Hu Did Not Fight with the Pans; The Judge Has Learned the Truth</h3>
<p>Hu Zhichang, the manager of the Great World Dance Hall at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Tibet Road, and Sun Ziming (i.e., Zhimin) were recently sued in the Criminal Court of the First Special Court by Pan Yugui and his brother Pan Jinmao, residents of No. 16 Songjia Lane, Beijing Road, who hired lawyers Ling Qihong and Huang Shaochang to accuse them of colluding to defraud them of money and inflicting injuries. Yesterday morning, Court President Qian Hongye presided over the joint trial in Criminal Court No. 1. Defendant Sun Ziming did not appear in court because his address was unknown and the summons could not be delivered. Only Hu Zhichang appeared in court with his defense lawyer, Xu Jia. Pan Jinfang stated that he and his older brother Pan Jingui used to work at the Huiling Deng Dance Hall. Later, Sun Ziming, who was from the same hometown, introduced them to Hu Zhichang. Hu, who was the manager of the Great World Dance Hall, was willing to let them run the cloakroom, toilet, and candy counter in the hall. He took a deposit of 450 yuan and a "activity fee" of 500 yuan. Tang Guanqing, a witness, saw 100 yuan of it being handed over. Unexpectedly, the two defendants saw that they were easy to deceive. They contracted the cloakroom to someone else and only offered them waiter positions. They pocketed the 500 yuan "activity fee." They repeatedly asked for it back but were refused. Later, they were not even given a waiter position. Therefore, on August 26th, at 3 PM, he and his brother went to ask for the money and retrieve the waiter's guarantee. They were beaten by Hu and he ordered dozens of gangsters to surround and beat them, causing serious injuries. Therefore, they filed a lawsuit, requesting that the defendants be punished according to the law and ordered to jointly return the 500 yuan "activity fee." Hu Zhichang testified that he did not know the two plaintiffs. Sun Ziming introduced them to contract the cosmetics display area of the dance hall. It was stated that the deposit was 500 yuan and the rent was 50 yuan. He paid 50 yuan in cash on July 25th and a check from the Silk Industry Bank on August 1st for 100 yuan. The remaining 400 yuan was to be paid before the opening. He also recommended the plaintiffs as waiters, and he agreed to hire them. Unexpectedly, when the check could not be cashed, he sent a letter to Sun Ziming urging him to pay, but he ignored it. He had no choice but to return the original check on the 12th and the 50 yuan in cash on the 24th, terminating the contract. He also returned the receipt he had issued to the plaintiffs, which can be verified in the accounts. Unexpectedly, on August 26th, the plaintiffs gathered four or five gangsters and came to cause trouble. They clashed with the guard, Zhao Haiqing, and went to the police station. He did not participate in the fight. He invited witnesses Zhao Haiqing and Tang Guanqing, the chief inspector of the Great World Amusement Park, to testify. After the lawyers for both parties debated, Judge Qian ruled in court that Hu Zhichang was not guilty and dismissed the plaintiff's attached civil suit. The trial of Sun Ziming was temporarily suspended.</p>

<h3>### Two Corpses Unearthed Due to Odor: Found Inside Women's Hospital</h3>
<p>The house at No. 290 Tangshan Road, Hongkou, at the intersection of Zhaofeng Road, was originally church property and was previously used as a church. It is now leased by Renhe and used to open the Hongkou Women's Hospital, which is luxuriously decorated. Yesterday evening, a foul odor suddenly permeated the area, causing surprise and concern. People rushed to report it to the police at the post. The Huishan Police Station dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives, along with workers, in several cars to search the area. After arriving, they knocked on the door, but no one answered. They broke in through the window and opened the door, allowing the detectives to enter. They first searched the house but found nothing. They then opened the floor and were shocked to find two corpses, which had already decomposed. Their faces were blurred and unrecognizable. However, based on their clothing, it could be determined that there was a male and a female corpse. Detectives continued to search the scene, but the people from the hospital had already fled and disappeared. Whether this couple committed suicide or was murdered is unclear, but based on the circumstances, the latter seems more likely. The police are currently investigating the matter thoroughly.</p>

<h3>### Indian Man Treats Child's Eye Disease, Child Suddenly Dies After Taking Medicine; Cause of Death Unknown After Examination; Stomach and Intestines Awaiting Testing</h3>
<p>Xu Changming, a 37-year-old coolie from Jiangdu, who lives in a straw shed without a number on Feihong Road, Zhabei, has a son named Genbao, who is five years old. Recently, he suffered from a severe eye disease and had difficulty with bowel movements for a week. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, Xu and his wife, Liu, took their son to the ophthalmology clinic of an Indian man named Gharam Singh (transliteration) at No. 623 Zhaofeng Road. The Indian man examined the child and asked for 15 yuan for medical expenses. Xu did not have that much money. After negotiations, the consultation fee was reduced to one yuan. Xu still could not raise the money, so he went home to get it. The Indian man gave the child medicine and laxatives to treat the disease. Unexpectedly, shortly after taking the medicine, the child suddenly died. When his father returned to the clinic and saw that the child was dead, he argued with the Indian man. Detective No. 2177 found out about it and reported it to the Huishan Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. They transported the child's body to the Shanghai Sanitarium for a brief examination, and then transferred it to the autopsy center on Ferren Road. Yesterday morning, Zhang Zongru, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctors Wei Ligong and Zhang Yan, and clerk Wang Zuyi, went to the center to examine the body. Xu Liu, the child's mother, stated that she said the Indian man often gave the child a mixture of red, green, black, and white liquids, as well as laxatives. Shortly after taking the medicine, the child died, so she requested justice. Gharam Singh, the Indian man, stated that he is 30 years old. He gave the child a laxative because he had difficulty with bowel movements. As for the liquid medicine, his mother gave it to the child herself. Zhang asked him if he had a medical license from the Municipal Council. He replied that he only sold Baoyan eye medicine, so he did not need a license. Zhang stated that the cause of death could not be determined from the appearance of the body. In order to clarify the truth, he ordered an autopsy. The autopsy report stated that the cause of death of the boy, Xu Genbao, was unknown and an autopsy was needed. After the autopsy, the body was handed over to his father, Xu Changming, for burial. A package of laxatives was given to the forensic doctor for testing. It is reported that forensic doctors Wei and Zhang have already performed the autopsy and have handed over the internal stomach and intestines to the Municipal Council's testing center for testing.</p>
<h3>The Sorrowful Tale of Yang Xiuzhen: Driven to Despair by Poverty and Abandonment, She Attempts Suicide in a Hotel and is Rescued, Recounting Her Heartbreaking Ordeal</h3>
<p>Yang Xiuzhen, a 33-year-old woman from Hangzhou, recently resided in room 23 of the Anle Hostel on North Zhejiang Road, using the name Wang Yangshi. On the 7th of this month, at 8:05 AM, she suddenly attempted suicide by consuming raw opium. A tea server discovered her and immediately reported it to the Huishi Police Station. Detective Shen Dehui rushed to investigate, while Yang was sent to the Sanatorium Hospital for treatment. Several suicide notes were found in the room, one of which detailed the suicide attempt. The content is worth recording, and here is an excerpt of the main points:</p>
<p>"I (referring to Yang herself), in the twelfth year of the Republic (1923), married Leng Fugen from Lvcheng, Danyang, through a matchmaker. We had a son named Yaoqing, now twelve years old. Our relationship was not bad, but Leng did not engage in proper work. In the eighteenth year of the Republic (1929), I encouraged him to come to Shanghai to find work, but he was unsuccessful. He happened to meet Wang Zhijing, a fellow villager of the owner of the Yunlaifu Button King store at 468 Fuzhou Road, who offered to introduce business and frequently lent money. However, his true intention was to seduce and possess a married woman from a good family. Later, he forced my husband to repay the debt. Unable to repay, my husband fled back to his hometown. Wang seized this opportunity and frequently harassed me. In a moment of weakness, I fell into his trap. From then on, I lived with him at 7 Weiyangfang, Baoshan Road. He gave my husband 100 yuan to divorce me. Afterward, I officially lived with him at [blank] Santuoli Lane, Baike Road. Later, I learned that Wang already had three wives and concubines, and I was forced to live as a minor concubine. Fearing abandonment, I had him sign an agreement. But in April of this year, Wang tricked me to a hotel on the road, got me drunk with wine, and when I woke up, Wang was gone. Later, when I went to Wang's place to ask for expenses, Wang said that I had signed a separation agreement in the hotel, so how could I come back to ask for money? Later, Wang even invited female hooligans to beat me severely. I then hired lawyer Shen Xing [blank] to sue him, but Wang wanted to reconcile. [Blank] As a result, there was no response. On May 10th, at about 11 PM, Wang ordered someone to tell me to go and negotiate a reconciliation. When I arrived at the entrance of the alley [blank], I was suddenly attacked with an axe by two people. The police arrested the assailants. The lawyer helped me book room 53 at the Anle Hotel, instructing me not to go out. After ten days, [blank] he asked me to pay the rent and go home (the following contains many accusations against the lawyer). I have repeatedly tried to assassinate Wang Zhijing to serve as a warning, but I have failed. In addition, due to financial difficulties, I am resorting to this fate," and so on. The suicide note also included a copy of the woman's complaint, filed on June 12th at the Civil Mediation Office of the First Special District Court, suing Wang Zhijing for neglecting his duty to provide alimony and requesting monthly payments of ten yuan in national currency, as well as a letter to her son, Leng Yaoqing. The handwriting is skilled, suggesting that she had received higher education, but there are many mistakes, which proves her state of mental distress at the time. It is now known that Yang has been rescued by the hospital's efforts and is out of danger. She will be discharged from the hospital soon."</p>

<h3>Tong Rongsong, Convicted of Enticement, Appeals: Legal Arguments Examined, Hearing Concluded Yesterday, Judgment Scheduled</h3>
<p>Tu Xiaoying, an 18-year-old woman from Ningbo, currently residing at 5 Yongxiangli, Datong Road, Zhabei, previously, through her uncle Tu Jianren and her mother Tu Chenshi as legal representatives, hired a lawyer to file a complaint in the First Special Court against Tong Rongsong (19 years old, residing at 6 Jinleli, Weihaiwei Road) from Tingdu for enticement and forgery. The first instance verdict found Tong Rongsong guilty of having illicit relations with a girl under sixteen, sentencing him to six months imprisonment, and two months for forgery, to be served consecutively as seven months. Prior to execution, he was to be sent to the Gongbuju Reformation Center for three months of moral education. It was permitted for bail of 5,000 yuan pending appeal. These details have been reported in this newspaper previously.</p>
<p>It is now known that Tong Rongsong, dissatisfied with the first instance verdict, hired lawyers Wu Linkun and Dong Chi to submit a written appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court, requesting that the original verdict be overturned and Tong Rongsong be declared not guilty. The appeal meticulously details the legal points, spanning several thousand words. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu, along with Assessors Zhou and Nie, convened a hearing. Both parties were questioned. Tong Rongsong admitted to having illicit relations with Tu Xiaoying, but claimed that the 2,000 yuan China Industrial Bank deposit book was written under duress and not of his own volition.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the appellant's lawyer, Wu Linkun, argued, "This case is divided into two points: facts and law. The facts were thoroughly investigated in the first instance and there are no major discrepancies, so we will not dwell on them. We will now focus on the legal points. The legal representative of the victim, Tu Xiaoying, in the original complaint was her uncle, Tu Jianren. This violates the litigation procedure. According to Article 212 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the legal representative or spouse of the victim may independently file a complaint. Also, the second paragraph states that if the victim has died, the complaint may be filed by the spouse, direct blood relatives, collateral blood relatives within the third degree, relatives by marriage within the second degree, or the head of the household. In this case, the victim, Tu Xiaoying, is not of age, but she is not deceased. According to the law, only her legal representative can file a private prosecution. Tu Jianren claims to be Xiaoying's uncle, and claims to be serving in the military and completely unaware [of the matter], hoping to avoid the statute of limitations. Her adoptive father and biological mother are both alive, but it is unclear on what basis he independently filed the private prosecution (the private prosecution was entirely initiated by Tu Jianren alone), which is difficult to understand. Furthermore, regarding the statute of limitations in Article 216 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the first instance record shows that Tong Rongsong and Tu Xiaoying had relations on May 6th of last year. When Tong paid 3,000 yuan, Tu Chenshi also knew that her daughter and Tong had a relationship. Therefore, Tu Chenshi was aware of the matter in May of last year. Article 216 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that 'For crimes that are prosecuted only upon complaint, the complaint must be filed within six months from the time the person entitled to file the complaint becomes aware of the identity of the offender.' The statute of limitations has already expired. Moreover, Tu Xiaoying had indeed reached the age of sixteen when the relationship occurred. This is the reason for the appeal against the charge of illicit relations. Regarding the charge of forgery, although the passbook is printed with the words 'China Industrial Bank Savings Passbook', the page with the bank's seal and the manager's signature was torn off before the appellant wrote 2,000 yuan on it. It has lost its validity as a passbook and is obviously a discarded passbook. How can it be considered a document under criminal law? Therefore, we request that the original verdict be overturned and the appellant be declared not guilty. If the court deems it necessary to impose a sentence, we request that leniency be granted in consideration of the appellant's youth and ignorance, and that probation be granted."</p>
<p>Finally, the appellee's lawyer, Peng Qixiu, responded. After the arguments were concluded, the court announced that the judgment would be delivered on the afternoon of the 17th of this month.</p>
<h3>Zhou E'xuan and Son's Status Confirmed, Alimony Dispute Continues: Zhou Only Willing to Give 15 Yuan Per Month, Initial Trial Dismissed, Now Appealing</h3>
<p>Zhou Wei'shi, a wealthy merchant from Suzhou residing in Shanghai, had a physical relationship with a prostitute named Zhang Zhuying ten years ago, resulting in a son named Dunan. Later, Zhang reformed and placed Dunan in foster care, with Zhou E'xuan responsible for the monthly living expenses. Until two years ago, E'xuan suddenly denied fathering the child with Zhang and stopped paying for the child's living expenses. Zhang filed a criminal lawsuit against E'xuan for abandonment, which concluded after three trials with Zhou sentenced to six months imprisonment, suspended for two years.</p>
<p>Dunan's father-son relationship with Zhou has been legally confirmed. Now that he is still a child, Zhou is responsible for his living and education. Therefore, Zhou filed a petition with the First Special District Court, requesting that Dunan's alimony be confirmed at 15 yuan per month in national currency. However, Dunan's mother, Zhang Zhuying, in her capacity as guardian, filed an objection, stating that the Zhou family is wealthy and that E'xuan had been paying 50-60 yuan per month for living expenses before the lawsuit. How can 15 yuan sustain his life? As a result of the initial trial, the plaintiff's lawsuit was dismissed. Zhou, dissatisfied, has now hired lawyer Huang [blank] Yan to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court, still requesting that Dunan's living expenses be confirmed at 15 yuan per month. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen Hong specially convened a collegiate panel for a hearing. Neither party appeared in person. After arguments between lawyer Huang and Zhang's lawyer, Xiang Xun, the court announced that the judgment would be delivered on the afternoon of September 15th.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Government Officials: Selling Official Positions for Profit in Shanghai, Mastermind Yu Dagong Flees, Three Accomplices Arrested</h3>
<p>Yu Dagong has no legitimate occupation and makes a living by fraud. Recently, he conspired with Zhu Lingen from Changzhou, Wang Wenxi, Jin Ayu from Jiangyin, and others to impersonate the Second Division Command of the Jiangshan County Command Headquarters of Zhejiang Province. Under the pretext of recommending positions in the Jiangshan County Command Headquarters, they dispatched accomplices to defraud people of money and issued forged symbols and badges. The victims included Yang Pikang, Liu Yuesheng, Wang Guoliang, Tao Quanlin, Yang Baogen, and five others, who were defrauded of a total of 136 yuan. They lured Yang Pikang and the other five to room [blank] of the Changzhou Hostel at [blank] Lane, North Zhejiang Road to continue their fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Gu Yuncheng, captain of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, discovered the scheme and reported it to the Huishi Police Station around 4 PM the day before yesterday. Together with Detective Shen Jinwen, they went to the Changzhou Hostel and arrested Zhu Lingen, Wang Wenxi, and Jin Ayu. However, the mastermind, Yu Dagong, had fled. They were taken to the police station, and [blank] magnetic badges, one cloth symbol, and four photos were found on each person. They were ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Ninth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted them for fraud and breach of trust under Article 339 of the Criminal Law, stating that the defendants impersonated government agencies, spread rumors and defrauded people, and sold official titles. To gain the trust of the victims, they not only required them to pay registration fees and activity fees, but also had them take photos, as if the matter were real. Except for Yang Baogen, who was defrauded at the Qibaolou Tea House in Laobeimen, Nanshi, the rest of the offenses occurred within the Settlement. However, it is feared that there may be other victims, and the mastermind has not been apprehended. Therefore, it is requested that the hearing be postponed. Furthermore, the victims have successively reported the matter to prove the facts. When questioned, Jin and Wang confessed that the money they received was handed over to Zhu Lingen, and Zhu also confessed that he was manipulated by Yu Dagong and did not even know where Jiangshan County was located. The judge verified the confessions and ordered the three defendants to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing next Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Establishment of a Tuberculosis Clinic to Promote Children's Tuberculosis Work: Adopting the Latest Children's Tuberculosis Rules and Laws, Low Fees Suitable for Long-Term Treatment</h3>
<p>Since the Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association's Medical Committee and the Hongqiao Sanatorium organized X-ray group checkups, initially registered by the Shen Bao, the public has enthusiastically participated in the checkups, as they are related to the early diagnosis of lung disease. However, how to treat lung disease after it is detected has become a serious problem in terms of time and economy for those in the workplace and those with limited financial resources.</p>
<p>Dr. Ding Huikang, director of the Hongqiao Sanatorium in this city, recognizing this situation, has established a specialized "Tuberculosis Clinic" at No. A2, Daxilu, with the aim of serving the public with the latest scientific equipment and affordable fees. The clinic adopts the latest anti-tuberculosis rules and laws from various countries: (1) to popularize early diagnosis so that people do not delay medical treatment until their illness becomes severe, losing the proper time and opportunity for treatment; (2) to popularize physical therapy methods for treating lung disease, as the four major principles of lung therapy—sunlight, air, nutrition, and rest—are only supplementary therapies, and medicines, regardless of type, only have temporary or symptomatic effects and are of little value in fundamentally treating lung disease. Chinese people are superstitious about conditioning and do not know about isolation, leading to a rampant spread of the disease. To implement treatment, it is necessary to make the general public understand that in addition to all symptomatic and supplementary therapies, there are more reliable physical methods that can shorten treatment time, reduce the patient's suffering, save expenses, and increase social production and national construction capabilities; (3) to popularize sanatoriums; (4) to popularize health and insurance.</p>
<p>According to statistics in the United States, in 1904, there were 204 lung disease deaths per 100,000 people, which decreased to 67 in 1931. In recent years, the number of lung disease deaths has decreased even further. The reason for this is entirely due to the accurate proof of the pathological causes, the promotion of early anti-tuberculosis diagnosis, the progress of physical and surgical treatments, and the complete facilities of sanatoriums and public health. China must catch up urgently to promote anti-tuberculosis work.</p>
<p>The clinic has now hired Dr. Li Zubai, a medical doctor from the University of Berlin, Germany, and a former physician at the Internal Medicine Hospital of the University of Vienna, as the medical director. Consultation hours are from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM and 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM daily, specifically to facilitate those in the workplace. The consultation fee is one yuan, and sputum tests are free. Long-term treatment, including X-rays, chemical tests, consultations, and various chemical and physical therapies, is very affordable. The location is No. A2, Daxilu, at the end of Fuxu Road. Dr. Ding's consultation hours for heart and lung problems are scheduled separately from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Dr. Gong Yuanbing Returns from Studying in Europe and America</h3>
<p>Mr. Gong Yuanbing, 45 years old, is the eldest son of Mr. Gong Ziyu, the Chinese manager of the British-owned HSBC Bank in this city. He was intelligent from a young age, graduated from the medical department of Tongji University, and has been practicing medicine in Shanghai for more than ten years. With his meticulous skill and care, all who sought his medical attention were cured, so patients were grateful and praised him widely. He had long been renowned in Chun Shen. Later, he independently founded Zhengde Hospital, which has been operating for six or seven years with excellent results and a good reputation.</p>
<p>Dr. Gong Yuanbing felt that medicine was advancing with each passing day, and treatment methods were constantly evolving. He successively acquired the latest German-style electrotherapy instruments to explore and treat various diseases. Recently, Dr. Gong went to Japan, the United States, England, France, Belgium, Austria, and other countries to study medicine in greater depth. He spent a long time studying in Germany and gained much insight. He arrived in Shanghai last night on the North German Company's Schamborst steamer. He will surely make a great contribution to society with his knowledge of modern new medical techniques.</p>
<h3>Robbery in Caoci Lane</h3>
<p>At 3:15 PM yesterday, six robbers speaking local, Jiangbei, and Ningbo dialects suddenly entered the home of Zhang Baoquan, who runs a redwood furniture store and exchange business at No. 28 Caoci Lane, Wenmiao Road, Nanshi.

<h3>Pudong Waterworks Project Construction Expected to Be Completed by the End of the Year</h3>
<p>According to the Outer Theory Agency's translation of the Continental News, the Pudong Waterworks Project is expected to be completed entirely by next spring, benefiting 120,000 residents. Currently, drinking water is mostly drawn from the riverbank or streams, with sediment mixed in the water, which is inconvenient and detrimental to hygiene. According to research by hygiene experts, Pudong is a center for the spread of infectious diseases. Fire and police authorities are also well aware that the inconvenience of obtaining water makes it difficult to control fires. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, when planning the construction of Greater Shanghai, had long foreseen this and made sure to address all aspects of development. Therefore, before proceeding with the construction of Pudong, he prioritized the laying of water pipes.</p>
<p>According to the construction plan, which was drafted in the winter of the previous year, the municipal government and the Greater Shanghai Waterworks Company requested its implementation. After inspection, it was found that many Pudong residents lived along the river. Therefore, the construction site was determined near the Youlong Road pier opposite Edward Road. The construction project is being undertaken by the Chengtai Construction Company at a cost of one million yuan. When completed, it will be one of the most modern waterworks projects in China. The machinery is being supplied by a German trading company in this city and can supply 350,000 gallons of drinking water per day. If future needs increase, it can be increased to 2.5 million gallons. Construction began a year ago. The water tower has been completed, and the internal water storage and sand filtration projects are under construction. In addition, the water plant office building is also under construction. It is hoped that all construction projects will be completed by the end of this year. The laying of water pipes is also progressing relentlessly, and it is said that one-third has been completed.</p>
<p>Although the waterworks is operated by the Greater Shanghai Waterworks Company, a commercial enterprise, the business plan focuses on public interests. Therefore, the water fees will be kept low. For users who cannot afford to install water pipes, water tanks will be set up at convenient locations on the streets for retail sales, with prices slightly lower than indoor installations to meet the general demand.</p>

<h3>Zhu Baolin Returns from Studying Abroad: Meeting Held to Welcome Him by People from All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhu Baolin, the eldest son of Mr. Zhu Gengtao, a prominent figure in the Shanghai business community, went to the United States two years ago to study medicine. This summer, he obtained a master's degree in medicine and returned to China via Europe. Upon hearing the news, his relatives and friends, considering Mr. Zhu Gengtao's years of service to society and his long-standing reputation, and noting that his son had graduated from St. John's University with a medical degree and was not content with that, but was determined to pursue further studies in the United States, decided to welcome him, confident that he would make many contributions to society in the future.

This is because the sisters have always focused on promoting loyalty, filial piety, and righteousness in their performances, making them extraordinary and deeply appreciated by all walks of life. It is now known that on the 13th and 14th of this month, Zhu and her sister will perform the newly written "The Fox Spirit's Fate" in both the day and night shows.

<h3>China Merchants Bureau Openly Invites Bids for General Supplies</h3>
<p>Since the reorganization of the state-run China Merchants Bureau, efforts have been made to improve some of its operations. All purchases are made through open bidding whenever possible. Due to its business needs, the Bureau requires a large quantity of general supplies, including printed materials and stationery. Since the abolition of the comprador system on all ships and the return to self-management, all general supplies are now issued by the Bureau, resulting in a sharp increase in demand. Dealing with stores for procurement at any time has become cumbersome. Although the procurement procedures are extremely meticulous, there is still concern about not demonstrating complete impartiality. To maximize openness, the Bureau will publicly invite bids for the following seven categories of major items: A. Printed materials, B. Stationery, C. Tea, D. Soap, E. Towels, F. Electrical supplies, G. Firewood, Toilet Paper, Western Toilet Paper and Brooms. Advertisements will be placed in newspapers for several days to invite merchants to bid. The deadline for submitting bids is the 22nd of this month, and the bidding will take place at the Bureau. The Bureau has also prepared bidding rules, draft contracts, and standard price lists, etc., and will welcome businesses to visit the Bureau to obtain them from the 13th of this month.</p>
<h3>Steamboat Passenger Ticket Association Requests China Merchants Bureau to Revise New Ticket Sales Regulations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Steamboat Passenger Ticket Association believes that the China Merchants Bureau recently changed the passenger service rules promulgated by the Ministry of Communications and issued new regulations for ticket sales. After investigation, the association finds that the procedures for agents in the new regulations are far more complicated than the passenger service rules issued by the Ministry, which adversely affects business and is not a minor matter. Therefore, an emergency meeting was convened yesterday to discuss countermeasures. Under the chairmanship of Chen Weifan and recorded by Lu Hongnian, a unanimous resolution was passed to appeal to the Ministry's promulgated rules and the Bureau's agreed-upon methods for selling ship tickets and to request that the China Merchants Bureau withdraw the new regulations to facilitate business and maintain livelihoods.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I recently saw in your newspaper's September 9th issue of the "National Products" special section, that an article entitled "The first inventor of the water battery electrical lamp was the Hua Yi Industrial Company, which only produced a sample, and submitted it to the Ministry of Industry in June to apply for a patent, which was temporarily suspended due to insufficient capital and pending approval from the Ministry." After reading it, I was very surprised and alarmed. The water battery safety lamp invented by our company was approved for a patent by the Ministry of Industry. A notice was published in the Xin Shen and Shen Bao newspapers on August 11th and 12th. As for capital, it has been fully guaranteed. We are currently installing machinery and actively preparing for production to commence. The sections reported in the newspaper are obviously incorrect. Fearing that the outside world will not understand the truth and be confused by the rumors, we have sent this special letter to clarify and hope that you will correct it. Respectfully yours, the editor. Hua Yi Industrial Company of China, September 10th.</p>

<h3>This Year's Western Football League Divided into Three Groups: A, B, and C, and Morning League. Group A Teams Must Join a Reserve Team and Set Up a Reserve Group. Davidson's Dual Management System Fails Again.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Western Football League's annual meeting was held at the Xitong Public School on Jiujiang Road at 5:15 PM yesterday. Eighteen representatives from various teams attended. Chairman Ge Linxu presided over the meeting and reported on the previous season's competitions and financial matters. Then, Litt announced the start of the election, and the reform plan of the league system was passed (as stated in the notice of the 17th of last month). However, Davidson's highly anticipated dual management system was rejected again by the league authorities and was not submitted to the general assembly for discussion, which is a strange thing. As for the teams, no proposals were put forward at this meeting. The meeting adjourned at about 6:00 PM. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Participating Teams</p>
<p>The deadline for registration for this year was the 5th of this month. As a result, a total of forty teams were obtained. Subsequently, the Public School of the Public Concession requested to join, and it has also been approved. Therefore, the total number reaches forty-one teams. The Youyou team will continue to join this year. The Jinan team has also registered to join this year. The lineup of both sides is currently unknown, but most of Youyou's main players last year were Jinan athletes. Now that Jinan has been reorganized, its main players will naturally return to their parent team. Therefore, the strength of Youyou this year will be noted by the general public. Also, this year's Donghua Stadium will be the main venue for the Municipal Sports Stadium. In the future, various competitions in the league may be held at the Municipal Sports Stadium. As for the forty-one teams participating in this session, there are a total of six new members, and the other thirty-five teams are old members. The detailed allocation will be reviewed and implemented by the executive committee of the association and then announced. The full list is as follows:</p>
<p>List of Teams</p>
<p>French Business, Youyou, Donghua, British Army, Lux, Portugal, Western Business, Western Police, Jewish, Shell, St. Francis, British Navy, St. John's, Aurora, Hygiene, French Army, Qinghua, Russian Army, Surveying, Chinese Police, Elementary, Seville, Apperon, Tongwen, Public Union, Guanglu, Railway, Asia, Vitesse, Yousheng, Russian Overseas Chinese, Lansd, Calsa, Pader, Fire Brigade, Jinan, Dongguang, Nie Zhongcheng, Jinde, Bank of Communications, Public School of the Public Concession.</p>
<p>Election Results</p>
<p>The association's annual election has always adopted a voting method. This year, it was changed to an election by nomination. Moreover, each representative received a pre-determined list printed on a typewriter. As a result, the list was passed without any objections. The chairman remains Mr. Ge Linxu. There are four vice-chairmen. Except for Kueil, who was replaced by Ma Qi, there were no other changes. In addition to the five chairman and vice-chairmen who are ex officio members, four people were elected by the general assembly yesterday, and only one new member, Kang Bosi, was added. In addition, five members of the new chapter drafting committee were elected to be responsible for drafting the new constitution and new rules. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman Ge Linxu, Vice-Chairmen Bo Lieqi, Litt, Ma Qi, Shen Siliang, Executive Committee Members Ma Xuer, Kang Bosi, Lei Yanshi, Ke Huat, New Chapter Drafting Committee Ma Qi, Ke Huat, Ai Qixun, Ga Xu, Huo Hua.</p>
<p>Shen's Speech</p>
<p>Then Mr. Shen Siliang was invited to give a speech, which mainly stated that "Although a Chinese football team failed to win the victory in the World Games, it has received an honor, that is, the technology of the Chinese team has been praised by various countries in the world. The Shanghai Football League has been in a very important position in the country, and the future is immeasurable. I hope that the feelings of each team will become more profound, so that Shanghai's football industry can reach the world."</p>
<p>Principles of Reorganization</p>
<p>The association passed the reform plan of the league system for this year, which was planned by the executive committee of the association, on the 17th of last month. Yesterday, it was submitted to the annual meeting for discussion by the member teams. Ge Linxu read it item by item and explained everything. From the first to the eighth items, all were passed without objection. Only the "or" in the seventh item was changed to "and." In the ninth item, Ai Qixun and the representative of the Western Police team spoke successively. As a result, it was revised to increase the number of members of the League Committee to six (originally five), with one elected by the Group A teams, one by the Group B teams, and one by the Group C teams. This plan is still a principle, and the trial period is two years, until 1938. Yesterday, five members of the new chapter drafting committee were elected to be responsible for drafting the new constitution and new rules. The reformed principles passed yesterday are recorded below.</p>
<p>New Charter Contents</p>
<p>(1) This year's Shanghai Western Football League is divided into three groups (Groups A, B, and C).</p>
<p>(2) Set up a "Reserve" group, which is specifically for the reserve teams of Group A to join the competition. Players can also participate in Group A competitions without restrictions. Additional prizes will be awarded.</p>
<p>(3) Member teams joining Group A must join a reserve team in the Reserve Group.</p>
<p>(4) The bottom team in Group A must be demoted to Group B, and the champion of Group B can be promoted to Group A (but must join a reserve team in the Reserve Group). The bottom team in Group B is demoted to Group C, and the champion of Group C can be promoted to Group B.</p>
<p>(5) Another (Sunday Morning League) is established, which is the successor to last year's Group E, with a limit of ten teams.</p>
<p>(6) All member teams can join the League or the "Sunday Morning League."</p>
<p>(7) All member teams can join the League or the Sunday Morning League.</p>
<p>(8) The winner of each game gets two points, the loser gets zero points, and a draw gets one point each. If the score is the same after the end, the average score is calculated.</p>
<p>(9) The number of members of the League Committee for this season is six, three of whom are selected from the executive committee, and the remaining three are selected from the member teams, one is elected by the Group A teams, one is elected by the Group B teams, and one is elected by the Group C teams. Each team is only allowed to put forward one representative to participate in this election. This committee has no power to interfere with administration, but must report to the executive committee for processing.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Speake, Davidson's "dual management system" is a novel and perfect plan based on the latest British football rules, but since the powers are divided, management will be difficult, so the association did not adopt it, which is a pity.</p>

<h3>Our Country's World Games Football Team Wins Against Geneva Servette: Geneva Newspapers Unanimously Praise</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Geneva Dispatch: For several days, large advertisements have been hung on the streets and alleys of Geneva, stating, "The Geneva Servette team is scheduled to have a friendly match with the World Games Chinese football team at 6:15 pm on the 20th of this month." It goes without saying how eagerly those in Geneva who are interested in sports are awaiting this day. Even those who usually do not pay much attention to sports are rubbing their fists and preparing to watch. Rather than saying they are watching the game, it would be better to say they are curious, because this is an unprecedented event in the Geneva sports world: the first contact with the young men of the Central Plains. What kind of skills do Chinese athletes possess? This is what they are eager to experience. Most people here base their predictions of victory or defeat on physique and skill, as if the Servette team holds a sure winning ticket. The Servette team, having experienced many formidable opponents, seems not to take the Central Plains athletes to heart. Moreover, the psychology of the masses is enough to increase their arrogance. However, the Geneva newspapers are already cautious about them. Three days before the match, the attitude of the newspapers seemed to be giving them some warnings. The Geneva newspaper (Journal'de Geneve) on the 18th of this month stated, "The Servette team will play against the Chinese football team on the evening of the 20th. We should know that these eleven chosen players of the Celestial Dynasty (referring to the Chinese team) have secured victory in twenty-three out of twenty-nine international matches in the past. Four times, the strength was evenly matched. Although they lost to England once in the World Games, it was a glorious defeat... Therefore, requests for matches continue to pour in..." It went on to say, "The Chinese team is very strong in terms of technique, and their speed of movement is unpredictable..." The same day, the Swiss Daily (Lasuisse) said, "This is a unique opportunity, because the Chinese team is on a traveling tour and will definitely arouse special interest among the audience... And this match will probably not be ordinary, because the team (China) has competed against the strongest Germany..." On the 19th, the Geneva Tribune (La Tribune de Geneve) said, "...The Servette club never disappoints their audience, because they only invite the most famous football teams of the moment to their field. Tomorrow evening, they will meet the players of the Chinese World Games team. How excited and anxious the audience is to wait... For a long time, this is the first time a famous friendly army has been invited..." It can be seen that in their proud anticipation, they also expressed doubts. On the evening of the 19th, many overseas Chinese were waiting on the platform of the Geneva train station. In addition, there were representatives of the Servette club. Everyone's eyes seemed to be focused in one direction. In the sound of the turning wheels, the twenty-two Central Plains athletes arrived in Geneva and stayed that night at the hotel booked by the Servette club. Reporters also went to the hotel to talk briefly with the Chinese team members. At that time, observing their tired expressions from the journey, they were quite worried about the match tomorrow. Overseas Chinese who met at the hotel had the same feeling without prior agreement. Because they were the host and we were the guest, they were relaxed and we were tired. Although we had words of encouragement, we did not dare to be too optimistic in our hearts. After returning to our accommodation, we could hardly sleep.</p>
<p>The next day (the 20th), as the time of the match approached, the reporter went to the hotel at 4:30 to have tea with the team members. At 5:30, they set off together. Seeing that everyone's fatigue from the journey had not recovered, their spirits were invigorated, and they were happy and harmonious. They chatted and laughed in the car, feeling relaxed and content. The strangest thing was that no one mentioned the match, as if they did not care about winning or losing. It cannot be said that they were not used to formidable opponents and had seen it all before. The reporter also gained a lot of courage because of this.</p>
<p>The Servette field is far in the suburbs. After a fifteen-minute drive, we arrived. However, the national flag of the Republic of China, with the blue sky, white sun, and red earth, and the Swiss flag, fluttering in the wind on the high poles extending out of the field, had already caught our eyes. The reporter then said to the Chinese team members, "This is the first time, the first time our national flag has flown over a Swiss football field. We hope it will fly many more times." The team members smiled at each other.</p>
<p>When we first arrived, there were not many spectators, but when the opening ceremony began, the four sides were already surrounded by crowds. The front box seats were already feeling overwhelmed, so they had to temporarily raise the price. There were more than 3,000 spectators. It's a pity it wasn't a Saturday afternoon or Sunday, otherwise the audience would have been several times larger.</p>
<p>The match began. The Servette representative presented the Chinese captain with a bouquet of flowers to express a friendly welcome, which was very courteous. In the first twenty minutes, Servette's attack was extremely fierce, and our side seemed to focus on defense and failed to counterattack. At this time, the reporter turned to look at the audience, and some overseas Chinese were pale, and some were anxious and uneasy, not knowing how worried they were. But in an instant, the first goal was kicked into the opponent's goal by Mr. Li Huitang. Our side turned from defense to attack, and the enemy's formation showed chaos. However, the other side had a better physique, with long legs and tall bodies, which gave them a lot of advantage, so at the end of the first half, the score was tied at two to two. But a few times when our side's attack was tense, the other side kicked the ball back into their own camp or out of the field to avoid danger, which was a bit too unsportsmanlike, so the audience booed in unison to express their dissatisfaction. And when our side won, the audience also applauded equally without bias. The fair attitude of the audience caused the other side's goalkeeper to scold, "Stupid audience..." This was certainly very rude, but when I think back to my attitude at the time, I couldn't help but be too biased, because I only applauded for my own side. But I believe the overseas Chinese were just like me.</p>
<p>In the first half, our side's formation was as follows:</p>
<p>Huang Jiliang</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng, Mai Shaohan</p>
<p>Chen Zhenhe, Xu Yahui, Zhang Xianyuan</p>
<p>Zhuo Shijin, Sun Jinshun, Li Huitang, Feng Jingxiang, Yang Shuiyi</p>
<p>Reserves: Cai Wenli, Huang Meishun, Li Guowei, Cao Guicheng, Jia Youliang. In the second half, our side's formation was slightly changed, that is, Jia Youliang replaced Yang Shuiyi, and Yang Shuiyi replaced Zhuo Shijin. The second half started ten minutes later. Because the outcome had to be decided within forty minutes, both sides became more energetic, and the audience was even more nervous. In this half, both sides were penalized. Most of our side's penalties were due to touching the ball with their hands. In addition, our side was the most disciplined, which won the sympathy of the audience. In the first twenty minutes, our side scored another goal. In the next twenty minutes, the two sides fought even harder. The other side tried to restore the balance, but failed. In the end, our side won by three to two. The overseas Chinese's anxious mood half an hour earlier had turned into high spirits, as if they had won the supreme honor. The audience also applauded continuously, and many people came to congratulate our team members. Many children surrounded our team members, patting their shoulders and shaking their hands, expressing their admiration and respect in an innocent and innocent way. At nine o'clock that evening, our delegation to the League of Nations and the delegation to the International Labour Organization jointly hosted a banquet for the team members at the Geneva Chinese Restaurant to wash away the dust and celebrate the victory. The guests and hosts were all happy and did not disperse until nearly midnight. The Chinese team went to Paris the next morning. It is said that they will play two matches in Paris, one in Harvard, and two in London. They are scheduled to return to China by ship from Naples, Italy, on the 4th of the month.</p>
<p>The next day, the Geneva newspaper (Journal de Geneve) began with the sentence, "What a surprise! Servette was defeated by the Chinese World Games team." The audience was driven by curiosity or wanted to see the skills of the Chinese team members who had fought against England for eighty minutes at the World Games fifteen days ago. On the other hand, because the Japanese World Games football team played against the Grashoppers team (editor's note: on the evening of the 10th, the Japanese World Games football team lost to the Grashoppers by zero to sixteen), they did not believe that the Chinese team was a strong opponent of Servette. But as a result, we believed that Chinese football was better than Japanese football. In the section describing the match, the newspaper said that Servette did show great effort at the beginning of the match. The Chinese defense was often under their pressure. The Chinese side seemed only able to parry and unable to counterattack, but the agility of the Chinese defenders and the power of the forwards were unexpected. In the blink of an eye, they turned from defense to attack. It went on to say that the Chinese team members had a solid belief in their forwards (referring to Li Huitang), so their spirits were very consistent, and their passing speed was unpredictable. At the same time, their main player (Li Huitang) never let them down. Finally, it said... In terms of physique and technique, Servette should have had the advantage. If the Chinese team can put more effort into technique, even the famous European teams will have to be shaken. The newspaper also encouraged Servette to learn from their strengths and make efforts to reorganize. The same day, the Swiss Daily said, "We were very curious to wait for the friendly match between Servette and China. Servette had played many matches with famous European teams and even African teams, but this was the first time they had played with an Asian team. This time, China won. However, Servette's fierce attack in the first half forced the Chinese team to only parry and unable to fight back. People generally thought that China's match against Servette would be like Japan's match against the Grashoppers team. At the very least, Servette could defeat the Central Plains players by four or five to zero. In the end, they did not expect that their goalkeeper's agility was enough to defend, and the forward's ferocity was able to kick the ball in from a distance of 25 meters. The speed of their team members' passing was truly without loss. In contrast, we felt that the Servette players' movements were too slow." The newspaper also said that in terms of technique, Servette should not have lost, but at that time, Servette's formation was chaotic, and their attitude was sometimes unsatisfactory. The forward protagonist and the Chinese team's strong players were even more unmatched.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Chinese team's expedition, on a tiring journey, with 29 international matches, was able to win 23 times and draw 4 times, which cannot be said to be surprising. At the same time, it also broke the Europeans and Americans' long-standing perception of our country's sports world. This immortal memorial is indeed one of the best ways to promote our country. Out of love and admiration, we sincerely hope that our team members will take the experience of this expedition, learn from their strengths, and make further progress. In the future, their importance in the international arena can be asserted.</p>
<p>The reporter still remembers that in July of this year, Professor Zhang Pengchun of Nankai University passed through Geneva and gave a five-day academic lecture at the Geneva Institute of International Studies. The audience increased gradually, and each lecture was met with thunderous applause for several minutes. Almost all the professors of the University of Geneva were mobilized, and its impact was unprecedented. Within a month, the Chinese sports world won another victory here. How fortunate and honored it is for the overseas Chinese in Geneva to participate in this joyous event.</p>

<h3>Peking Research Institute's Seventh Anniversary: Li Shuhua Reports on Research Work and Funding: Rubbing Exhibition and Academic Lectures in Huai Ren Hall</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Peking) The National Peking Research Institute held its seventh anniversary celebration today (the 9th) at 9:00 am in the auditorium of the institute inside Yunliao Gate. The director of the institute, Li Shihui, was unable to return to Peking due to matters in Nanjing. Deputy Director Li Shuhua presided over everything. The academic community of Peking was extremely enthusiastic in attending. Those who attended included Xu Bingchang, Wu Zhengzhi, Tao Xisheng, Li Linyu, Fook Kenson, Li Shutian, Cha Liangzhao, and representatives from all walks of life, totaling about 200 people. When the meeting began, etiquette was observed. First, Chairman Li Shuhua reported on the overview of the seven years of work. Then, Xu Bingchang, director of the Historical and Archaeological Group of the institute, reported on the joint rubbing exhibition organized by the institute and the National Peking Library. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Li Shuhua's Report</p>
<p>Today is the seventh anniversary of the institute. The director originally planned to attend, but he could not return to Peking due to matters in the south. He expressed his extreme apologies. The institute began preparations in 1928 and was formally established in 1929. It has now been seven years. The guidelines set at the time of establishment were to cooperate with various agencies and academic groups. Over the years, there have been many cooperative projects with various parties. The Radium Research Institute and the Pharmaceutical Research Institute cooperated with the Sino-French University. The Geological Research Institute cooperated with the Industrial Geological Survey. The institute cooperated with the Academia Sinica and various universities to organize the Pacific Science Association and establish marine biological research institutions. The Bohai Marine Biological Research Laboratory was established in Yantai, and specialists were sent to Yantai to collect and conduct research. It also cooperated with the Qingdao Municipal Government to form the Jiaozhou Bay Marine Animal Collection Group. Regarding archaeological work, the institute cooperated with the Shaanxi Provincial Government to form the Archaeological Society to carry out surveys of historical sites and excavations of antiquities in Shaanxi. The institute's regular expenses are 30,000 yuan per month. We ourselves feel that we have not dared to waste the 30,000 yuan per month for the country, which is still not sufficient. Fortunately, the various Boxer Indemnity agencies have helped a lot. The Sino-French Boxer Indemnity subsidized the Radium Research Institute with 7,000 yuan, the Pharmaceutical Research Institute with 7,000 yuan, and 20,000 French francs. The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity subsidized equipment costs with 100,000 yuan and subsidized the Physics Research Institute with 60,000 yuan and the Chemistry Research Institute with 40,000 yuan. We are deeply grateful for the subsidies from the various Boxer Indemnity funds.</p>
<p>Xu Bingchang's Lecture</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the Peking Research Institute's seventh anniversary celebration, various rubbings are displayed in Huai Ren Hall. These items were all collected during archaeological excavations in Shaanxi. Among them, many are important parts. Today, the rubbings are displayed, but they are all displayed in groups. The most precious ones are the stone statue of Emperor Taizong of Tang and the Laozi's Tao Te Ching. The origin of Chinese stone carvings, such as stone drums and stone carvings, is the oldest, while stone statues seem to have been created in the time of Emperor Wu of Han, more than 2,000 years ago. The stone carvings of Zhang Qian, Marquis Wu of Wang, and Kunming Pool are also very famous at one time. A lot of Han paintings were discovered in Puyang. The exhibits are mostly items that have not been seen outside. The stele of Laozi's Tao Te Ching was discovered in Shaanxi and is octagonal in shape. Very few remain.</p>
<p>Wu Zhengzhi's Lecture</p>
<p>In summary, while Peking Research Institute celebrates its seventh anniversary today, the Chinese scientific community has also made great progress in these seven years. Although science started early and research was initiated, the fields of physics and chemistry have made significant progress compared to thirty years ago. The achievements can be seen everywhere. Peking Research Institute has also made the greatest contribution in the seven-year process. Peking is the cultural center of the country, and the famous scenic spots and buildings can all express the great spirit of China. It is fortunate that the research institute can exist in this cultural area, and it is also fortunate that the cultural area has this emerging scientific organization.</p>
<p>Tao Xisheng's Lecture</p>
<p>The topic was the relationship between academia and society. The general idea was that in the past seven years, not only has academia made progress, but society has also made progress, because the progress of society has influenced the progress of academia. The progress of society in recent years has been caused by the collapse of the social economy. The past seven years in China can be said to be the most unfortunate period, with disasters, banditry, and so on. But these various adverse phenomena have their future hope. As for scientific products, if society cannot accept them, they will never be able to promote social progress. The old mentality and the new organization are difficult to match. The old mentality is entirely based on the aspect of profit. For example, the spinning wheel of small handicrafts, if driven by a motor, will certainly not be able to cope. In other words, it should be considered whether society has the ability to accept science. To seek social and scientific progress, the old organization of Chinese society has completely collapsed, and there is an urgent need for new science. It is hoped that the colleagues of the research institute will pay attention to how to apply the results of their research to society in the future. After the lecture,</p>
<p>Lunch</p>
<p>The meeting did not begin to disperse until 2:00 pm. After the meeting, a photograph was taken in the empty space of Fuchang Hall behind Huai Ren Hall to mark the occasion. Then, they went to Huai Ren Hall for lunch, with about 100 people. There was a lot of talk and laughter during the meal, which was quite lively. It did not disperse until about 1:00 pm.

<h3>The Recent Four Years (V) of National Central University</h3>
<p>— Luo Jialun</p>
<p>(3) Reorganizing Student Dormitories</p>
<p>In the past, most of the student dormitories of our university were rented from private houses, resulting in them being scattered in various locations, which was extremely inconvenient for management. Furthermore, non-university students often mixed in to stay, which not only violated school rules but also increased school expenses and disrupted public order. In view of this, our university believed that reorganizing the dormitories was a matter of utmost urgency. Therefore, despite extremely difficult economic conditions, we managed to raise a large sum of money to build two relatively large dormitories, and returned all the previously leased houses. This allowed a portion of students to be concentrated in the first dormitory on campus, female students to be concentrated in the female dormitory on campus, and the majority to be concentrated in the newly built dormitory. All students were assigned rooms by person, so that the school could easily manage them and students could easily study on their own. After this reorganization, not only was management more convenient, but the dormitories took on a neat and orderly appearance. Moreover, the problem of non-university students residing in dormitories, which had been criticized by society and neglected by the government for many years, was completely resolved.</p>
<p>9. Expanding the Area of University Property</p>
<p>Over the past four years, there has also been a significant increase in the area of university property. With the kindness of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, it was decided to allocate the Wulong and Mufu Mountains near the suburbs to our university. The Wulong Mountain area is more than 7,700 mu, and the Mufu Mountain area is more than 6,000 mu, totaling more than 13,700 mu. In addition, farmland was purchased and expanded in Kunshan and Jiangpu counties, totaling 118 mu. Furthermore, a sixth dormitory for faculty and staff was purchased near the main campus, costing 11,804 yuan (this was purchased at the end of the 21st year, before the decision to build a new campus site). (Recently, more than 5,000 mu of land was purchased for the new campus site at market price.) This is a general overview of the increase in university property.</p>
<p>10. Centralizing the Location of Colleges to Facilitate Observation and Learning</p>
<p>Previously, the locations for offices, classes, and research of various colleges were extremely scattered. Some departments of the same college were in different locations, and even within a single department, different courses were taught and experimented in different places. After several planning sessions, they are now more centralized. Currently, Zhongshan Yuan is used as the College of Liberal Arts, the Science Hall as the main building of the College of Science, Southeast Yuan as the College of Law, Nan Gao Yuan as the main building of the College of Education, and the New Classroom as the main building of the College of Engineering. The College of Agriculture has always been concentrated in Sanpailou and has not been changed.</p>
<p>11. Centralizing Administrative Agencies to Increase Office Efficiency</p>
<p>Previously, the office locations of various administrative departments and groups were extremely scattered, making communication inconvenient and supervision difficult. Now, the two wings of the auditorium have been re-partitioned and properly arranged, and all of the school's administrative agencies have been moved in. This saves time and naturally increases efficiency.</p>
<p>12. Reforming the Accounting System</p>
<p>The supervision and assessment of the school's finances depends on the accounting system. Due to long-standing habits, the school's accounting was disorganized and lacked established procedures. This led to abuses, even allowing people to sell or buy public property on behalf of others without any restrictions. Therefore, three accountants were hired to establish a proper accounting system, which was promulgated and implemented in the autumn of the 21st year. This was even before the government formulated accounting regulations. The aim was to ensure that all accounts were clearly categorized and readily available for inspection and submission at any time. In addition, the procedures for general affairs were clarified, standard prices were made public, and samples of items were retained for regular audits.</p>
<p>13. Maintaining Regular Payroll to Ensure the Stability of Faculty and Staff Life</p>
<p>For the past four years, thanks to the government's support, educational funding has not been deficient. However, during the crises of the Rehe Incident and the Fujian Incident, our university repeatedly experienced financial difficulties. But no matter what, we have always maintained the prescribed payroll period and have never delayed it by even a day, in order to maintain the stability of the lives of faculty and staff.</p>
<p>14. Reorganizing Debts</p>
<p>The school's old debts were deeply accumulated, some dating back to the Southeast University era. During this period, efforts were made to reorganize them, and a committee was organized to review the documents. A total of 97,899 yuan and 22 cents were repaid successively. Those that could not be handled were deferred. However, during my tenure, all purchases were made according to the policy of "preparing before purchasing," so there were never any arrears. Our international credit has gradually been restored.</p>
<p>15. Establishing Scholarships and Publicly Funded/Free Student Places</p>
<p>In order to encourage student scholarship and help poor students, starting from the 21st academic year, seventy scholarships were set up each semester, totaling 140 scholarships per year, each worth fifty yuan per semester. A committee organized by professors publicly assessed and awarded scholarships to students with excellent academic performance. Starting from the 25th academic year, in accordance with the Ministry's order, the scholarship system was abolished and replaced with publicly funded/free student places. The number of publicly funded students was set at 20 to 28, and the number of free students was set at 50 to 70.</p>
<p>16. Raising Admission Standards and Paying Attention to School Examinations</p>
<p>University education should emphasize quality over quantity, and it must be so in order to raise standards and develop academics. Therefore, from the 22nd academic year to the present, professors have been hired as examination committee members for each entrance examination to handle the examinations seriously and eliminate all forms of solicitation and malpractice, so that the students' levels are more uniform. However, the number of freshmen in each session has been increasing year by year. As for the various examinations in the school, in addition to the graduation examination, a committee is organized separately in accordance with the Ministry's order, and scholars from inside and outside the school are hired to preside over it together. All other examinations are handled seriously by the professors. Regular examinations, such as required courses such as English and Mathematics, all use the cumulative system to ensure strictness. Therefore, general coursework is becoming more and more serious. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Annual Meeting of the China Vocational Education Society - Members Return to Shanghai - Reportedly, the Spirit of the Meeting Was Excellent - All Proposals Were Practical</p>
<p>The 16th Annual Meeting of the China Vocational Education Society and the 14th National Vocational Education Discussion Conference were held in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, starting on the 16th of this month. The meeting has ended. Shanghai members such as Jiang Wenyu, Yang Weiyu, He Qingru, Yao Huiquan, and Jia Foru, after the meeting, assisted the Sichuan provincial authorities in planning vocational education and stayed for many days. Now that their work is finished, they have returned to Shanghai by taking the Minsheng Industrial Company's ship. According to them, more than 200 members registered for this annual meeting and vocational education discussion conference. The spirit was excellent, and all proposals were practical.</p>
<h3>Two Schools Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Hujiang University</p>
<p>Shanghai Hujiang University opened yesterday. At 7:45 AM, an opening ceremony was held in the auditorium. President Liu chaired the meeting, gave a speech on Hujiang University's new direction, welcomed new students, and introduced new faculty and staff. All students participated. After the ceremony, classes began according to the curriculum. The enrollment quotas for all grades have been filled, and the dormitories are crowded. The opening ceremony of the middle school department was held on the same day. The number of freshmen this semester is greater than last year, and all academic programs have been enriched and improved. It is also learned that the business school in the city center has also started classes and will hold a supplementary opening ceremony on the 12th of this month, with an entrance examination.</p>
<p>Xinhua Art Academy</p>

<h3>Do Chinese Youths Have Combat Power?</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>It is a sad thing for a person to try to achieve success with a weak body. It is a pitiable sight when a person's vitality is so low that he cannot work cheerfully and automatically, but can only work by forcing himself with willpower.</p>
<p>It must be understood that the greatest economy of intelligence that a person can implement is to store up the largest amount of physical and mental strength as a means of achieving results. When encountering extraordinary events, success or failure depends on how much combat power you have prepared. In other words, it depends on whether you have a considerable amount of ability stored up. The question at this time depends entirely on whether the ability you have stored is sufficient to cope with the situation. Because strong physical strength can enable people to achieve victory in their careers everywhere, we believe that health is the first condition for achieving victory in life's battles.</p>
<p>Look! The youth of China today generally have weak bodies and a listless spirit, giving us a shocking impression anytime and anywhere. Is it self-evident whether people like this have combat power? Therefore, the root cause of our country's accumulated weakness and the weaknesses of the national body and mind lies in this. If we still have a bit of determination to strive for strength and save the country from danger, we must prepare a large amount of combat power. In this way, we must have sound cultivation on weekdays, and then the Chinese nation will have hope for rejuvenation.</p>
<p>Physiologists and physicians have proven that our physical strength, spirit, and intelligence are all produced by the brain. Therefore, if we want to cultivate a healthy brain! We must strive to remove the "neurasthenia" that destroys vitality in the dark in order to move towards the path of light! We know that to defeat this disease (neurasthenia), we must regularly take nerve-nourishing drugs. Currently, Neurotic (Mimeier Brain Tonic), which is trusted by doctors around the world, is a special agent for strengthening nerves, strengthening the brain, and replenishing blood. It can relieve our fatigue, remove our illnesses and pains, and sow health and happiness. It is a supreme contribution of modern science. According to experimental reports from doctors in various countries, all those who are physically weak and mentally depressed, regardless of whether the cause is congenital deficiency, post-illness imbalance, debauchery, or excessive labor, and other symptoms of qi and blood deficiency and nerve attenuation, can be readily resolved by "Mimeier Brain Tonic." After taking it for a few weeks, they will gain new vitality to deal with everything and be able to cope with it with ease.</p>
<h3>Causes and Treatments of Asthma</h3>
<p>— Physician Yu Qixi</p>
<p>The occurrence of asthma. In addition to the nervous system function. Changes in the properties of blood. Also have a great relationship. The circulation of our blood. So that it can follow the normal and unchanged. All rely on the soundness of the organs that make blood. And the appropriateness of gas exchange in the lungs and skin. Proper drainage organs. And the endocrine glands are harmless. Among the endocrine glands related to asthma. That is the thyroid gland. The pituitary gland. Adrenal glands. Testes and ovaries, etc. If these glands are once functionally impaired, the composition of the blood. Thus, it changes because of it. At this time, the number of eosinophilic blood cells or lymphocytes increases, especially when the pituitary gland and adrenal glands are diseased. Clinically, the blood changes or divides. Breathing is slow and strained. Carbon dioxide increases because of it. Oxygen is lacking because of it. If these phenomena reach a certain level. The blood becomes toxic. The onset of asthma. Is caused by this.</p>
<p>The treatment of asthma. If you use sedatives as an emergency. Can only relieve temporary suffering. Most of them cannot be completely cured. Therefore, there is no escape from the worry of recurrence. Since 1905, when Kaplan applied the adrenal preparation Adren Alin to asthma. Modern treatments for asthma. No one does not use the products of endocrine glands. For example, Suprarenin from the adrenal glands and Hypophysin from the pituitary gland are important products for treating asthma. Now there is a medicine called "Xiaoli Ping" Hol-ipin. Based on the above principles. A mixed preparation using various endocrine and ephedrine extracts. Not only is it effective and fast. Moreover, its function has the special effect of fundamentally curing and preventing recurrence. When asthma attacks and is in short supply. Give "Xiao Li Ping" Holipin three tablets. About five or ten minutes after swallowing, the symptoms of the attack disappear. The patient recovers health. There is nothing else. That is, when asthma attacks. The patient's blood lacks the adrenal glands and the pituitary gland's secretion. After "Xiao Li Ping" Holip-in is taken, the blood composition is supplemented. That is, returning to physiological status. Therefore, all symptoms. Disappear immediately. Moreover, according to the experiences of European and Western clinicians. It is said that asthma patients who can use "Xiao Li Ping" Holipin for two to three months on a regular basis. That is, old asthma that has been difficult to treat for many years can also be fundamentally cured. Therefore, doctors in Europe and the United States treat asthma. Now they have abandoned injection methods. Specially use "Xiao Li Ping" for patients to take internally. Not only is the efficacy reliable. And safe and harmless. Especially suitable for home treatment.</p>

<h3>Enemy of Happiness! - Evil Effects of Masturbation</h3>
<p>— Physician Zhang Yuanzhen</p>
<p>Neurasthenia</p>
<p>The most obvious harm caused by masturbation is neurasthenia. Patients often experience heaviness in the head, headache, dizziness, tinnitus, nearsightedness, insomnia, forgetfulness, memory loss, sluggish thinking, lack of courage and decisiveness, absent-mindedness, palpitations upon movement, mental fatigue, depression, general fatigue, lack of vitality, inability to work, abnormal appetite, chest tightness, back pain, indigestion, haggard appearance, anemia, and emaciation. Even in the prime of life, they exhibit signs of aging. In short, the symptoms are numerous and cannot be fully described.</p>
<p>Nourishment and Therapy</p>
<p>The way to recover from this disease is to work hard to eliminate bad habits - masturbation - and avoid overworking the mind and body. In addition, nerve tonics should be taken. According to clinical experience of European and American experts, Memory Meurotic is the most effective. Various symptoms of neurasthenia will quickly disappear after taking it. One will feel clear-headed, mentally happy, mentally alert, physically strong, and have doubled energy.</p>
<p>Nocturnal Emission</p>
<p>Masturbation - can make the ejaculation center of the sexual nerves become overly sensitive. Slightly stimulated. It will immediately initiate sexual excitement - and there will be phenomena such as nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, and slippage. Patients must pay attention to general nutrition and washing methods. For treatment, you can use Folan Tad. Swallow two to three tablets before going to bed. It will take effect immediately. A two-week course of treatment can be cured. If there is an obstacle to the sexual function of the genitals, it is caused by the loss of sperm. You must also take kidney-tonifying and sperm-strengthening agents at the same time. Well Tonic is the most powerful.</p>
<p>Special Effects Treatment for Sexual Dysfunction</p>
<p>Semen - is the source of youthful vitality.

<p>The treatment of sexual dysfunction. The most effective medicine is the internal use of the testicular gland preparation Well Tonic. This is a world-renowned strengthening agent.</p>
<p>Guiding the Lost in Lung Disease</p>
<h3>The Human Body Fighting Bacteria...</h3>
<p>— Translated by Physician Shen Zhaoquan from the German Monthly Journal of Lung Disease</p>
<p>——Must Also Have a Solid Line of Defense——</p>
<p>Pulmonary tuberculosis, also known as pulmonary tuberculosis. Its pathogen is Mycobacterium tuberculosis (that is, tuberculosis bacteria). After this bacteria invades the lungs. It multiplies and proliferates in the lungs. And induration occurs. Therefore, it is called pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>The resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (tuberculosis bacteria) is extremely strong. No matter what kind of internal medicine and injection medicine. All cannot put it out. Only by relying on the natural defense power within our body. White blood cells surround Mycobacterium tuberculosis. And connective tissue is produced outside of it to build a dike. Build a solid line of defense. So that this bacteria cannot break out of the encirclement. And cut off its supply route. After that, the bacteria died. Therefore, with the stubborn vitality of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. If we do not have this natural defense function. It is not enough to control its death.</p>
<p>However, people in the world do not know how to use this defense power. As a fundamental cure. They want to rely on drugs to kill the bacteria. Therefore, patients often take Chinese medicine first and it doesn't work. Change to Western medicine and it doesn't work. Continue to take various special medicines advertised in the newspaper and it doesn't work. Or take monkey dates, Antitoxin bacteria, Ziheche and other various folk remedies and it doesn't work. Change direction four times in the morning and three times in the evening. Hundreds of medicines are thrown in a mess. After a long time, it doesn't work. As a result, the disease becomes more and more serious. Eventually, it will be unrecoverable. It is too sighing.</p>
<p>Modern scholars advocate. The only policy for treating pulmonary tuberculosis. The only way is to use human assistance methods. Seek to enhance the patient's own defense function. Strengthen the physiological resistance of the lungs. And promote the natural healing mechanism. The safest and most effective. If we want to increase the patient's defense power. And promote its natural healing physiological function. There is no good way. The only way is to use the internal use of organ preparations (that is, the medicine "Phith Weal" made from the internal secretions extracted from the lungs and spleen). Only then can this goal be achieved.</p>
<p>The "Phith Weal" of the organ preparation is based on the organ therapy theory advocated by the two masters of biology in Germany Berthold A. A. Berthold and British Starling. Its ingredients are made from the internal secretions extracted from the fresh lungs and spleen of healthy animals. It has been used in sanatoriums for lung diseases in various countries around the world. Made a long-term clinical experiment. For all tuberculosis phenomena such as stage 1, 2, and 3 pulmonary tuberculosis, chronic cough, hemoptysis, asthma, shortness of breath, night sweats, etc. It has been confirmed to have a very good effect. Beyond any chemical medicine. Physicians around the world regard "Phith Weal" as a famous name in modern medicine. There is an air of sweeping and reforming the treatment industry. Now I will list the advantages of this organ therapy used in the treatment of lung diseases that are different from all chemical drugs on the left.</p>
<p>(1) Can harmonize metabolism. Promote the function of endocrine. Make the decayed tissue revive. In order to achieve vigorous physiological defense function - overcoming tuberculosis bacteria.</p>
<p>(2) According to the function of tissue regeneration. And fill in the deficiencies of the disease. And promote the proliferation of connective tissue. Make the disease form scars. And promote the function of healing. Shorten the duration.</p>
<p>(3) Around the disease. Build a solid connective wall. Make it harden. Once this complete dike is created. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (tuberculosis bacteria) is locked. Lose its activity. Will eventually be completely destroyed.</p>
<p>(4) Stimulate the function of the spleen. In order to promote the hematopoietic effect and make the body weight increase. Good nutrition.</p>
<p>(5) For the infiltration of the disease. Can absorb it or dissolve it and can inhibit the secretion of toxins by bacteria and neutralize toxins in the body. Produce detoxification effect. Therefore, night sweats can disappear a few days after taking it.</p>
<p>(6) Can increase stomach heat. And promote the effect of secretion. Make digestion vigorous. Appetite increases.</p>
<p>(7) Has a strong coagulant force. Regardless of the size of hemoptysis. The prevention effect is very significant.</p>
<p>(8) Has the ability to produce specific immune bodies. Can increase the anti-toxic effect in the body. And make the tuberculosis susceptible (sex constitution is transformed into non-susceptible (that is, immune)) has tuberculosis cure - no tuberculosis prevention.</p>
<h3>To the Young Women</h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Xingfen, Female Physician, Head of Gynecology at Hongkou Maternity Hospital</p>
<p>A woman's health and beauty is, as everyone knows, indicated by her menstruation. If menstruation comes normally and recurs regularly, it generally indicates that her sexual function is not showing any abnormality, and it also suggests that her body is not undergoing any significant changes. Naturally, she is healthy and lively.</p>
<p>Normal menstruation indicates the soundness of a woman's body. Irregular menstruation indicates a woman's physical weakness. Therefore, menstruation serves as a measure of a woman's physical health. I often see young women with pale complexions, depressed spirits, and weakened bodies, and after examination and inquiry, nine out of ten cases are due to abnormalities in their menstruation.</p>
<p>The symptoms caused by menstrual irregularities are generally pain before and after menstruation. The menstrual flow is either excessive or insufficient. The menstrual cycle is irregular, occurring several times a month or once every few months. The lower abdomen and waist often feel distended and painful. Blood and energy are deficient, leading to various symptoms of neurasthenia, such as headaches, insomnia, stiff shoulders, palpitations, poor appetite, nausea, constipation, frequent urination, dizziness, fatigue, edema, general lassitude, dysfunction of the reproductive organs, pain during intercourse, decreased libido, frigidity, and lack of sensation. The various conditions of these symptoms, as described by the patients themselves, are quite numerous.</p>
<p>The miserable state of young women suffering from menstrual problems is truly indescribable. It ruins the beautiful dreams of couples and causes discord in the family. Because of the mental anguish, the happiness of youthful health and beauty is completely eroded by this menstrual pain. How regrettable! Therefore, menstrual disorders must be treated appropriately as early as possible, and attention must be paid to health maintenance. It must not be underestimated or ignored.</p>
<p>Among the medications for treating menstrual irregularities at home, 'Menorrin' is indeed effective in clinical practice. This medicine is effective for gynecological diseases such as menstrual irregularities and leucorrhea, as well as hysteria (i.e., neurasthenia in women). Taking 'Menorrin' can promote the development of female sexual organs, regulate menstruation, satisfy sexual desire, promote metabolism, remove blood stasis and generate new blood, replenish blood and strengthen the body, and prevent aging in women. For those who have been married for a long time without conceiving, using it to regulate menstruation and promote fertility is invariably effective. Numerous doctors have confirmed its effectiveness, considering it to be the source of women's health.</p>

<h3>Finance: Pure Gold Plummets to .203 — Market Conditions Return to Slackness —</h3>
<p>The gold market saw a sharp drop in London spot gold prices. Central bank benchmark prices were even lower. However, the unchanged exchange rate of shillings to US dollars increased selling pressure and led to a decline. Market conditions returned to a state of slackness. Early in the morning, news from overseas silver markets indicated that the UK market contracted while the US market remained flat. Large traders said that after the market closed, sellers were following the benchmark prices, causing market fatigue. The forward silver price in Montreux contracted by eight hao. Exchange rates continued to rise. London pure gold prices fell by five pence. The central bank's benchmark prices were announced, with both the UK and US markets flat. Customs gold unit prices fell by four li. The benchmark price for gold bars fell further to 1117.8 yuan. Off-market pre-trading opened, falling to within 25 yuan, then briefly rising to above 6 yuan.

Later, with Dah Đức Cheng and Wǔ Chāng Xiáng selling, the price fell to 4.5 yuan, and the situation stabilized slightly. The morning opened with low prices. After opening, supply and demand balanced out, and prices rose and fell briefly on the market, but the range was limited. Later, short sellers took the opportunity to exert pressure, gradually pushing prices down. There were still spot buyers taking advantage of the low prices, providing some support. However, because the exchange rates announced by the banks were flat for both the UK and US, and the silver equalization tax contracted by two-fifths, buying sentiment never really picked up. Although there was a rebound later in the session, it was mostly sideways movement. The overall trend turned mediocre, and the market became even more stable later. The morning session was slightly weak, and the afternoon gradually rebounded. Both the first and second reports on Indian silver were flat, and the market returned to a state of slackness at the end. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 1125 yuan, down two yuan from the previous close. Qià Fēng Yǒng advanced from 4.7 to 5.2 yuan. Chéng Dà, Dah Đức Cheng, Héng Yú, Yuán Mào, and Yǒng shed holdings, falling back to 4.1 yuan. Shēng Yuán Yǒng, Qià Fēng Yǒng still took in, rising to 4.8 yuan. HSBC's benchmark prices were flat for both the UK and US, and the silver equalization tax was reduced by two-fifths. Dah Đức Cheng and Fú Xīng Yǒng shed holdings, falling to 4.3 yuan. Shēng Yuán Yǒng, Yuán Mào Yǒng, and Dà Chāng Xiáng maintained at the low price, and then rebounded to 4.9 yuan, making the sideways trend even more apparent. Cross-trading was sparse. The morning session closed at 1124.7 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 1124.3 yuan. Qià Fēng Yǒng and Fú Tài Yǒng sold strips, falling back to 4.2 yuan. Tóng Tài Chāng, Dah Đức Cheng, and others took in, while Yuán Mào Yǒng and others also added to their positions, rising to 4.9 yuan. Fú Xīng Yǒng, Dah Đức Cheng, and others limited sales at the higher price. The session closed at 1124.7 yuan.</p>
<p>The closing price was benchmarked against the central bank's standard gold bar price, falling to 1117.8 yuan. Speaking in terms of closing prices, it was raised approximately seven yuan. The current month's registered price is 1122 yuan, and October's is 1125 yuan. The morning's water top-up was 1122 yuan. The price of red gold was increased by 13.5 yuan, and boiled red gold was increased by 15 yuan. However, there were no buyers. The selling price was increased by 12 yuan, but there were no transactions.</p>
<p>Trading within the market returned to a flat state. In summary, Shēng Yuán Yǒng, Tóng Tài Chāng, Dà Chāng Xiáng, Huì Xiáng, Yuán Mào Yǒng, Wàn Xīng, and others were on the buying side, while Dah Đức Cheng, Qìng Fā Yǒng, Chéng Dà, Héng Yú Xiáng Fēng, Fú Tài Yǒng, Jiǔ Dà Rùn Chāng, and Yù Xiáng Hé were on the selling side. Qià Fēng Yǒng advanced first and then exited.</p>

The highest price was 1125.2 yuan, and the lowest price was 1124.1 yuan, a difference of 1.1 yuan. The closing price fell 2.3 yuan from the previous close. There were still 672 strips left in the current month's forwards. In total, there were nine long positions and five short positions. For the October futures contracts, there were a total of 8610 strips, with 29 long positions and 41 short positions.

Afterwards, banks traded with each other and took in near-term shillings, with the trend sideways. There were also few changes at noon. In the afternoon, banks were slightly tight, and transactions were normal. Market conditions fluctuated. The first and second reports on Indian silver were unchanged. As a result, the overall trend stagnated. By the close, near-term selling prices were 1 shilling, 2 and 3125/10000 pence and 375/10000 pence against the pound, and 30.25 yuan against the dollar.

<h3>Securities: Bond Market Fluctuates Within a Narrow Range - Each Bond Only Up or Down by 0.1 to 0.25</h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, market conditions appeared slightly weak. Considering the current environment, the fluctuations would have been significant during times of high deposit balances. However, current deposit balances, excluding the 96 Gold Bond Long, are only around 20 million. New transactions are absolutely nonexistent, creating an invisible form of control. The prospects for trading are particularly difficult to develop. Therefore, the range of market price fluctuations is bound to be very narrow. Yesterday's activity, during both morning sessions, was slightly weak. Numbers 47 and 53 were sold, while Number 11 was bought, and Number 16 also saw some buying. Most activity involved settling transactions. Large-scale buying and selling were extremely rare. Market prices during both sessions only moved by about 0.1 to 0.2. Trading in both afternoon sessions was even quieter, and market conditions tended to be chaotic, with a sense of uncertainty. The absence of securities trading in this kind of environment must have a reason. There is not much hope for the future. The final market price results showed a slight decrease of 0.15 to 0.25. The total transaction volume was 4,465,000 yuan. A comparative table showing the results of the price increases and decreases is shown on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: New Chips for this Month are Slightly Lacking, Recent Yarn Market Momentum is Increasingly Strong</h3>
<p>Yarn Market: After the surge of the previous day, yesterday saw stability and a calmer trend. However, spot yarn business was not as active as the previous day, but selling prices remained firm. The short position of a major trader was still being covered, and new chips for delivery this month were slightly lacking, so the momentum of the current month became increasingly strong.</p>
<p>Short Covering Drives Exclusive Rise of .70 This Month</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Market opened with US cotton falling 3 to 14 pounds from the previous day's surge, market sentiment loosened again, and buying was peaceful.

By the third session close, Heng Yi, Chang Yu, Dachang Cheng, and Chang Feng's longs came to absorb again, tightening the market price. However, Yu Da, Feng Yi Cheng, and Tai Chang settled, keeping the market atmosphere calm. As a result, each month rose 0.2 to 0.4 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening market was mediocre. Due to clear weather, sentiment weakened further, and each month fell by 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 jiao. The second session was peaceful.

<h3>Cotton Prices Are Unstable, Foreign Cotton Prices Are Said to Have Increased, The Result is That Far Term Contracts Are More Firm and Expensive</h3>
<p>The cotton market is stable. Although American cotton has fallen back, Indian cotton has surged. Cotton prices in Zhengzhou, Yujin, and other places have risen, and people's confidence is growing. As a result, new selling is increasingly rare, and the market situation is still returning, but the weather is gradually clearing, and cotton fields are benefiting greatly.</p>
<p>New Short Positions Seem to Have Decreased Slightly</p>
<p>The opening of the spot cotton market saw Indian cotton surging, with Robbie up by half to 6.5 Robbie. However, the previous day's soaring American cotton fell back by 14 pounds, and Osaka's Sanpin cotton fell by 0.1 to 0.3 jiao. The weather gradually improved, and the market became ordinary. Each month saw a slight decrease of 0.1 jiao, but as trading moved to distant months, prices rose. Da Chang Cheng, Yu Da, Ming De, Hua Mao, Da Chang, Tong He, Xin Cheng, and Yuan Xing Chang all came to buy, while Geng Feng, Da Feng, Shen Chang, Yuan Yi, and Run Kang's longs sold a lot as well. As a result, the spot cotton market saw a gain of 0.05 to 0.1 jiao for each month compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening, due to the sunny weather and the change in wind direction, saw a decline of 0.2 jiao. The second session was flat. By the third closing session, the yarn market was good, and foreign cotton prices were rising, so prices rebounded again. The result was the same as the morning price, except for February, which rose by 0.15 jiao. It was found that Yu Da sold 3,200 dan, De Da 1,800 dan, Heng Yi 1,600 dan, Da Feng 2,100 dan, Shen Chang 4,600 dan, Ren Feng 5,200 dan, Yuan Yi 3,000 dan, Run Kang 3,800 dan, Yi Kang 1,500 dan, Chang He 1,600 bales, and Yi Cheng 1,600 bales. Ming De bought 3,300 dan, Da Chang Cheng 4,300 dan, Da Chang 9,500 bales, Tong He 5,300 dan, Xin Cheng 3,200 dan, Yuan Xing Chang 3,300 dan, Shan Chang 3,900 dan, and Sheng Yuan 3,400 dan.

<p>Cotton Merchants Quite Intent on Raising Prices</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is still good, and factory digestion is also healthy, but those holding goods are quite intent on raising prices. It is said that 4,000 bales of Yaohua cotton arrived, with an asking price of 34.2 yuan.</p>

<h3>American Cotton Rises Too Quickly, Causes Reaction</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with a rise of 0.4 to 0.7 pounds for each month. Early in the morning, Liverpool's news was strong, and traders, brokers, and foreign merchants all bought in. Soon after, the market price rose too quickly, causing some hesitation, and selling increased, with longs settling positions, causing a market reaction. However, demand from traders was still good, and near-term shorts were covering positions. Most of the current demand was to settle old positions. Factory buyers were average, and textiles were firm and active. The close was flat and weak, with spot prices falling by 0.4 pounds and futures prices falling by 0.4 to 1.2 pounds. English spot cotton rose by 39 points, and futures rose or fell by 1 point. A large number of longs on Indian cotton took profits and manipulators sold, which was absorbed by European exporters and futures traders. After that, cotton merchants cross-bought to meet long settlements. Nagpur rose by 2.25 rupees, Oomra rose by 4.75 rupees, and Broach rose by 6.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 9th).</p>

<h3>Shortage of Spot Piece Goods and Cotton Cloth, Autumn Clearance Sale on This Street is Booming, Purchasing Power in the Yangtze River Basin Increases, Sales are Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn and cotton markets were stable, and the cotton cloth market continued to be strong. After continuous large movements, inventory was short. 16-pound and 14-pound coarse cloth, after being purchased in large quantities by military units and the Tianjin gang, the market's bottom was depleted. Each stall expressed a lack of it, and the market price rose by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan per piece. Mainland gangs were the most eager to purchase. Stores on this street started an autumn clearance sale yesterday with greatly reduced prices, drawing crowded customers and booming business. Various ports along the Yangtze River, due to this year's abundant harvest, had slightly increased purchasing power, and sales of various goods were active. Pre-ordered patterned goods, printed velvet from various factories, Zhigong, Serge, line cloth, were shipped upon arrival every day. White goods, fine cloth, fine twill, were still being vigorously purchased by the Yue and Gui gangs, with over 400 additional pieces sold yesterday. After Tianjin gangs purchased large quantities of coarse cloth and coarse twill, they have been shipping in batches for days. The Dian gang purchased over 200 pieces of Hongzhang Factory's Three Sheep Zhigong, Serge, Meiheng Factory's crepe ne, Zhigong satin, line cloth, Guanghua, Renfeng Factory's Shilin cloth, this factory's fine cloth, coarse twill, Hengfeng Factory's Lao Hua Gong ne and other goods. Zhigong and Serge from Chinese factories, affected by the rising price of Dong goods "Four Gentlemen," also increased in price by 0.005 yuan per meter, it is said.</p>
<h3>Little Demand for Harris Tweed</h3>
<p>Harris Tweed, following Xiangshui Ne, was once popular. Later, because of its cheap price, buyers disliked it. The spring wholesale price suddenly rose this year, so people thought it was too expensive and avoided it. This autumn, the price of Harris Tweed is even more expensive. Ordinary goods are sold at 5.5 yuan, and low-end goods also require 4.6 to 4.7 yuan. As a result, buyers dare not take it. They only cut samples and try to sell them to customers first. However, customers find it too hairy and not soft, so there is little demand, leading to sluggish sales.</p>
<h3>Passenger Sales Gradually Increase, Yuanfang's Prices Increase, Do Not Decrease</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Thursday, was the 3006th auction of Yuanfang Foreign Firm. The goods displayed included Taixi satin, yuan velvet, Zhigong ne, Yugang foreign red cloth, a total of five types, 61 boxes of 46 brands. Patterned foreign yarn, poplin, foreign blue cloth, and bleached fine cloth, which were previously available, were not included because there were no goods arriving from overseas. Customers from various roads and gangs were active, and prices were higher than the previous period for each brand. Taixi satin was sold at 6 brands, increasing by about 0.01 yuan per meter. Yuan velvet at 2 brands increased by about 0.02 yuan each. Zhigong ne rose by 0.03 yuan. In Yuyu silk, there were 37 brands, including the Tongbao Sandingjia brand that had not been available for a long time, and industry members competed to buy it. The other brands mostly increased in price, with Weiluweixiao Xinshang Zhongqiu Denggao Jiulian Deng 4 brand each rising 0.5 yuan per piece, and the rest each rose 0.2 or 0.3 yuan, except for Kuailitu, which rose in price during the previous call, now decreased by 0.05 yuan. The price of four-weight red cloth is still strong, it is said.</p>
<h3>Food: Flour Near Months Rise, Far Months Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the morning opening, presented a tired and then stable trend. According to foreign wheat quotations, Chicago was down 0.001 yuan, and Canada was down 0.002 to 0.003 yuan. When prices opened, the weather turned sunny, and foreign wheat saw a slight decline, so prices at the opening were flat. November and below, due to long exits and factory hedging, had fallen back by about 0.015 yuan. However, off-market longs then took in again, causing each subsequent session to gradually recover. By the afternoon opening, although there were few transactions in the current month, the market atmosphere was tight due to floating shorts covering. Although sales were not smooth, outside firms still held on. The long-term mentality was different, and although outside firms bought in, sellers also flooded in, presenting a fluctuating trend. The future situation will depend on whether actual sales can continue, and then the market will return to the right path, it is said.</p>

<h3>Metals Domestic Copper Sheet Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Domestic copper sheets have seen a significant price surge recently. This is mainly due to the shortage of old copper raw materials plaguing various factories, leading to scarce production. The market demand exceeds supply, causing successive increases in standard prices. Currently, the market price is 52-53 yuan per dan, an increase of 2-3 yuan compared to the previous period. Compared to this time last year, the price has soared by about 10 yuan. It's also noted that thermos bottle factories are actively seeking supplies. Consequently, factories are actively searching for raw materials from Hong Kong and inland regions.</p>

<h3>Wheat Price Re-enters Stability After Fatigue</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market opened steadily in the morning, but then weakened for each month. It then showed signs of rebounding. Initially, although there was a slight decrease in foreign wheat, the market sentiment was mostly cautious. Therefore, the asking price was similar to the previous day. Later, due to the pullback of long positions and the lack of new buyers, the price fell by one or two points. However, when the market opened in the afternoon, transactions for each month were still active. Because the flour market rebounded and stabilized, the asking price for spot wheat also increased by one or two points, causing market sentiment for each month to re-enter stability. According to the current actual situation, the wheat market is inevitably expensive, and flour sales will naturally decrease invisibly. Therefore, insiders generally believe that although international changes are unpredictable, speculators may still take advantage of them. In the spot wheat market, high-quality wheat is asking for one or two points higher, while medium and lower quality wheat remains unchanged. Wuhe wheat is priced at $4.95, second-grade at $4.52, Guzhen wheat at $4.92, Wuyi wheat at $4.80, Zhuzhen wheat at $4.79, Gaoyou wheat at $4.75, second-grade at $4.73, Hushu wheat at $4.75, Nanjing wheat at $4.70, Tuqian wheat at $4.87, second-grade at $4.85, and Yanghe wheat at $4.92, and Zhenjiang wheat at $4.64. Fuxin and Fufeng each handled 3,000 bags, and Shenda handled 2,000 bags.</p>

<h3>Flour Mill Sesame Trading Resumes Vigorously - Enquiries from British, Japanese and Italian Merchants, Industry Insiders Also Replenishing at Low Prices</h3>
<p>The dumping and trading of foreign-grown new sesame seeds is trending towards vitality again. Due to inquiries from British, Japanese, and Italian merchants, and some industry insiders taking advantage of the low prices to counter short positions, the market atmosphere suddenly became tight, and the price was able to rise immediately. The previous night, Dafo and Heyi foreign firms handled 450 tons for October and November delivery, priced at $11.85. Yesterday, a Japanese firm handled 200 tons for delivery within this month, priced at $12.20. Jardine Matheson and others handled 300 tons for delivery in October and November, priced at $12.00.</p>
<h3>Prices for Thick Japonica Rice and Thin Indica Rice Remain Stable</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods from various groups was still only Nos. 12 and 13, with a total of more than 2,000 shih (石). However, both retail and wholesale markets were sluggish, making it difficult for the market to rebound. Prices for thick early japonica rice and thin indica rice remained unchanged. Dongxin japonica rice was also similar, with factory and riverfront prices being flat. New high-quality rice from Yangchuan and other places showed no fluctuations, and the price of “Yinbian Yuan” rice also lacked ups and downs.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, riverfront goods arriving were around No. 20. Various types of rice on the market were being consumed, with some transactions occurring for broken japonica rice, Dongxin japonica rice, old and new Yangjian rice, and new Yangtuanjian rice at lower prices. Sales of Xinbu Jian rice were slightly improved, and high-quality Yinbian Yuan rice was still active, while thin indica rice and new Kejian rice were average. Market prices for broken japonica rice were firm, while prices for new and old Yangjian rice and Dongxin japonica rice were flat and weak. The price of Xinbu Jian rice was slightly lower by two cents, high-quality Yinbian Yuan rice was firm, while medium and lower quality rice was weak. The price of new Tuankejian rice was reduced by a few cents.</p>
<h3>Decline in Kexian Rice Prices Triggers Cantonese Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were continued new arrivals of nearly 10,000 bags of Kexian rice, and sales of the local Kexian rice also reached 15,000 bags. However, with continuous arrivals in recent days, inventories have gradually increased. Due to the suspension of shipments by the Guangdong group for several days, there was more accumulation on the market. Traders and owners were all eager to sell. After the Guangdong group resumed shipments the day before yesterday, owners were quite willing to reduce prices to sell. Yesterday, the market saw a small decline of five or six cents. Sales were mainly to Guangdong, with approximately 7,000 bags of Shahan brown rice, Hunan broken rice, rice milled by machine in brown rice form, and Anqing rice being sold. Shantou also took 3,000 bags of Xianggan rice milled by machine in brown rice form, while the rest was sold by the local market.</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea - Poor Autumn Harvest in Japan, Local Silk Market Gradually Improving</h3>
<p>For more than ten days, the foreign silk market can be said to have been declining daily. However, since the news of the poor autumn harvest in Japan was announced, market sentiment has gradually become firm. As of yesterday, the silk markets in New York and New York showed a unanimous increase. It is estimated that 83 and 75 degrees of Japanese silk in New York each rose by three points, while Shanghai silk and Guangdong silk each rose by one point. Standard silk rose by four points for the near term and one and a half points for the long term. Spot goods rose by two to eight yuan, but Lyon did not show any changes. The silk market in Shanghai has seen healthy sales from various user groups, resulting in more stable prices than in previous days. Yesterday also saw a rebound. The foreign pure market is also gradually approaching, with Dachang and Bira and others having considerable purchasing interest. User sales are no longer quiet. If Yokohama silk prices can gradually become firm, then this local area will</p>
<h3>Qihong Tea is Planning a Complete Sale</h3>
<p>This year, the combined flower fragrance yield of Qimen, Fuliang, Zhizhi, and Ningzhou black tea is estimated to be 100,000 boxes. As of the current market, more than 8,800 boxes of Qining black tea flower fragrance have been sold, with varying qualities. Although British firms such as Xiehe, Jardine Matheson, and Jinlong have continued to replenish their stocks, it is not easy to clear the inventory. In view of this, the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea General Transportation and Sales Office plans to seek a complete sale plan and has ordered the Quality Assessment Committee to estimate the quality for review.</p>
<h3>Xilu Tea Baitou Firms Resume Purchasing</h3>
<p>According to the report from the Tea Shop Association, the green tea market still lacks large-scale transactions. In recent days, foreign firms have achieved some retail success with core-pulled Zhenmei teas, with Baochang and Tongfu each purchasing over 100 boxes and Tianxiang and Huacha each purchasing dozens of boxes at prices ranging from 90 to 112 yuan. Jinlong only has an appetite for Xiaozhenmei tea, purchasing approximately 250 boxes at prices of 22 to 23 yuan. Furthermore, Baitou firms have recently resumed purchasing Gongxi tea, with prices several yuan lower than before, approximately 22 to 23 yuan, resulting in over 400 boxes being traded. Approximately 700 boxes of Pingshui Zhenmei tea were purchased by Huacha at prices of 25 to 27 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Necessary Movement for New Poets</h3>
<p>— Lei Shiyu</p>
<p>In recent years, the Chinese poetry scene has indeed become much more vibrant, but in reality, there hasn’t been a phenomenon of “poetry publications and new poetry collections springing up like bamboo shoots after rain.” Taking Shanghai, the so-called hub of culture, as an example, there are no more than two or three poetry magazines, and instead of flourishing briefly, they seem to be in a criminal trial, never showing their face a second time. The new poetry collections that appear in a year are also only a few and very thin. Only in newspapers and general literary publications do poetry works often occupy some space. On the surface, it seems quite lively, but it is only relatively lively because it depends on the prosperity of general literary magazines. However, looking at the entire poetry scene, one cannot help but say that it is still shrouded in gloom.</p>
<p>The fact that there isn't a single regular poetry magazine in all of China is naturally due to the lack of organization among Chinese poets. Therefore, their activities also lack the strength of a group, and their creative practice lacks planning and unity.</p>
<p>If Chinese poets do not respond to the torrent of this troubled era by uniting and developing widely, even if we have the reality to provide us with great works, we will be overwhelmed by reality.</p>
<p>I am not against organizations such as "Poets' Clubs," but I am extremely opposed if they only take the form of a group of a few people! What we should advocate now and put into practice as soon as possible is the creation of a "Chinese Poetry Association." Only by establishing the front line of Chinese poetry in this unified, planned, universal, and connected way can the poetry movement develop strongly and effectively.</p>
<p>The Chinese publishing industry is terrible, especially with its continued neglect of poetry. Not only is there not a single bookstore willing to publish a dedicated poetry magazine, but even when a literary publication signs a distribution contract with the boss, it is often based on the premise of how many established masters are writing for the magazine. Editors also often hold onto idol worship or the common ills of "feudal systemism, dividing personnel and dividing art." Even worse, many old tyrants use magazines as a means of commercial profiteering and even deception.</p>
<p>In a publishing industry full of scams, coupled with the lack of security for writers' lives, the lack of certainty in publishing, and the lack of freedom in creative activities, the lack of cultural development is by no means accidental. This is often the result of the complex relationships formed by China's social, political, and economic factors and their interpenetration. However, the lack of organization among writers and the lack of a unified fighting front is also a major reason.</p>
<p>Without mutual criticism and encouragement, and without constant efforts, now, along with the unfolding of the tense world situation and the rapid changes in Chinese society, our literary artists consciously join hands and work hard for new poetry.</p>
<p>Poetry is a branch of art, and it is also the earliest art to emerge in mankind, and it has always been called the "King of Literature." However, this "King of Literature" is still like a "literary lackey" in our Chinese literary scene, but we do not want to establish a "kingdom" for it, but rather to make it a powerful trumpet in the struggle for national liberation!</p>
<h3>Donkey</h3>
<p>— Wei Dongming</p>
<p>"Is your animal well-behaved?"</p>
<p>That was the first time I rode a donkey. It was in the spring of this year when I happened to take a walk outside the school gate. Several donkey drivers surrounded me, soliciting business. Out of curiosity and the fact that I was bored, I agreed on a price with a middle-aged donkey driver with pockmarks on his face and decided to ride to the city gate. Knowing that there wouldn't be any danger, but because it was the first time, I was a little scared and asked that question, worried about encountering a stubborn and wild animal that would throw me off. The pockmarked man, while answering that the donkey had a very good temperament, walked down the dirt slope and untied the rope tethering the donkey from the wooden stake. When he pulled the rope uphill, the donkey braced its legs and refused to move, pulling its mouth crooked but still struggling not to take a step until the donkey driver whipped its back twice with the end of the rope, and only then did it lazily saunter up the dirt slope. This situation increased my doubts:</p>
<p>"Your donkey is probably too stubborn."</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, the animal just gets lazy when it rests, just like people. Don't worry, you can get on." The pockmarked donkey driver replied like this, his smile making people feel that he was kind and reliable. He had the donkey stop by the side of the road, straightened the saddle, tightened the girth, and then helped me onto the donkey's back, helping me insert my feet into the stirrups. Seeing that I had pulled up the reins and was sitting upright on the saddle, he walked to the front, pulling a section of iron chain tied to the donkey's left cheek strap, shouted, and the donkey started to walk.</p>
<p>When I first got on the donkey and only took a few steps, I was very nervous, my nerves were alert at all times. After walking a distance, I gradually calmed down. But just when I was about to relax a little, the donkey, upon reaching the main road, struggled to walk down a small path leading to the professor's residential area of the school. I quickly regained my composure, returned to a state of tension, and instructed the donkey driver to lead the animal back onto the original road. He told me that if I wanted the animal to turn in a certain direction, I just had to pull the reins on that side tightly. Then he explained that in the professor's residential area down that small path, there were several young students who often rode donkeys for fun. The donkey was familiar with this place, so without waiting for anyone to say anything, it walked onto that path.</p>
<p>I had the donkey driver continue to walk beside me, pulling the chain on the left side of the donkey's head, walking as slowly as possible. In order to pass the time and conceal the fact that the donkey was walking too slowly, I began to look for some things to chat about with him.</p>
<p>"Where do you live?"</p>
<p>"Just east of the garden, in the village next to the railway."</p>
<p>"What is your surname?"</p>
<p>"It's an honor for you to ask, my humble surname is Li."</p>
<p>Then he asked me my surname, and I told him.</p>
<p>"How many people are in your family?"</p>
<p>"Five, two adults, three children."</p>
<p>"No elderly?"</p>
<p>"They've all passed away."</p>
<p>"The three children are all yours, how many boys and girls are there?"</p>
<p>"They're all mine, three girls."</p>
<p>"It would be nice to have a boy, are they all in school?"</p>
<p>"You're right, but how can we afford to send them to school?"</p>
<p>"Doesn't the university in the garden have a public school? Free schooling, doesn't cost money."</p>
<p>"But the family doesn't even have two decent meals a day, and we don't have clothes to wear out. At home, they can also take on some odd jobs, collect some wild vegetables for the family to eat."</p>
<p>"Have you always made a living by driving a donkey?"</p>
<p>"Originally, my parents had more than ten acres of land, but with donations and taxes, and several years of famine, it was borrowed and mortgaged. When I took over, all that was left was a small donkey for grinding grain."</p>
<p>"Who was the land mortgaged to?"</p>
<p>"Who else but the big landlords on the ground? The land deed was mortgaged to them for money, and if you can't pay it back, it belongs to them."</p>
<p>At this time, the donkey had already walked onto the rural dirt road parallel to the railway. In front of a small coal factory near the station, a small coal truck was parked loading goods, and the donkey driving that truck was also facing the dirt road we were walking on. It raised its neck and began to bray at us. The donkey I was riding also raised its head and brayed at it, and kicked its hind legs, trying to run towards the coal factory. The conversation had to be temporarily suspended. I gripped the reins tightly, somewhat frightened, imagining what posture I should fall in so that I wouldn't get hurt so badly. The pockmarked man was not flustered at all, and very skillfully pulled the iron chain to lower the donkey's head, pressing it to make it stop on the road for a while before leading it slowly forward again. He told me not to panic, not to be afraid, this was common; when a donkey sees another donkey on the road, both of them will bray, just like when we people meet on the road, we will greet each other and say, "Where are you going?" Listening to these words, the panic-stricken beating of my heart had returned to normal, and I found his words rather naive and funny. I also thought about asking him if either of the donkeys was a female, and he said they were both male donkeys, female donkeys don't bray.</p>
<p>The conversation then turned from people to donkeys. The pockmarked donkey driver boasted that his donkey was stable and reliable and would not throw people off its back. Moreover—</p>
<p>"You're a beginner, but people who ride often specifically want fast ones. Running down from the Eight Great Sites of the Western Hills, forty or fifty li in one breath, running all the way to the destination, the person can't get off the donkey, the donkey is covered in sweat, and the donkey's legs and belly are trembling when it stands, wow, that's really!..."</p>
<p>"Then how do you keep up?" I interjected.</p>
<p>"Of course, I also run right behind, and if I can't keep up, I chase after it from a distance!"</p>
<p>In this way, just as he said, the more I rode, the bolder I became, so I told him that he didn't need to lead in front, he could just follow behind and drive the donkey a little faster. In fact, the road ahead was sandwiched between cornfields and could no longer allow a person and a donkey to pass through side by side with ease. He agreed and taught me again, if I wanted the donkey to stop, I just had to pull the rein back tightly and shout "Whoa, whoa..." and it wouldn't go. As he said this, he went around to the back of the donkey, shouting out another kind of sound, and the donkey quickened its pace, trotting down the dirt road. It kicked up the dust beside me, and this dust surrounded the donkey's hooves like yellow smoke.</p>
<p>A slight breeze brushed against my face, and as I rode on the donkey's back, bumping up and down, I felt a lightness that I didn't feel when walking slowly. Behind me, I heard the donkey driver's footsteps as he ran along, accompanied by the gradually louder panting.</p>
<p>As we went on like this, the donkey occasionally raised its head to look up. Thinking that it was going to bray and kick again, I pulled the reins and shouted "Whoa, whoa," and the donkey stopped.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? There aren't any of its buddies ahead, why is it acting up again?" I turned back and asked the donkey driver.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter," he came up and stroked the donkey's hindquarters and belly with his hand: "It raises its head to look at the old man, to see what time it is."</p>
<p>He then shouted again, and the animal started running again. In this simple action, I saw that he had not only a deep understanding of this animal but also an unlimited affection for it.</p>
<p>Turning from the suburban dirt road to the main road, the city gate was already in sight.</p>
<p>Since that donkey ride, I haven't ridden again. A few days ago, when I walked out of the school gate, preparing to go into the city, several donkey drivers and rickshaw pullers surrounded me again, soliciting business. Although I hadn't seen the face of the previous donkey driver, Lao Li, clearly because he was only on the side or behind me all the way, I was sure I recognized his pockmarks. One of the people surrounding me this time had a familiar pockmarked face. I said to him:</p>
<p>"Aren't you Lao Li? I'm not riding a donkey this time."</p>
<p>Seeing that I recognized him, he seemed a little happy, and he stepped back and pulled a rickshaw out from among the row of parked rickshaws and placed it in front of me, unexpectedly:</p>
<p>"Hehe, get in the car, where do you want to go, pay as you see fit."</p>
<p>I got into the car and asked:</p>
<p>"Lao Li, did you sell the donkey and buy a rickshaw?"</p>
<p>He replied:</p>
<p>"Hehe, the rickshaw is rented."</p>
<h3>A Certain Bank</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>The Witch's Home</h3>
<p>— Yin Guang</p>
<p>My landlady is a witch. When I first found this house, I was satisfied with all aspects, especially the cheap rent. But when I learned that the hall below was a place for offering sacrifices to gods, with plaques like "Always Responsive" and "Sincerity Brings Miracles" hanging all around, I hesitated. Other things didn't matter much, but my first concern was that too many people would come to burn incense, which would inevitably disturb my peace. Secondly, I was afraid she was worshipping a fox spirit, because, according to what others told me, these creatures are very petty. If you say something even slightly wrong, they will immediately play tricks on you. Although I am not superstitious, living with such a thing day and night would be very annoying. So I asked the old woman who was dealing with me – I later learned that she was the witch.</p>
<p>"What kind of Bodhisattva do you worship?"</p>
<p>She replied, "It's Madam Lü Chunyang."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but smile. "Are there many people who burn incense?"</p>
<p>"Not many, not many. You'll know after living here for a while." She seemed to see that I was afraid of the noise and hurriedly waved her hand as she answered.</p>
<p>Since she was not worshipping a fox spirit and wouldn't be noisy, I decided to move in. Now I have lived here for nearly three months, and I am very familiar with the family's life, and I even feel a sense of leisurely interest in them.</p>
<p>There are six people in their family: an old couple, two sons, and two daughters. The whole family are genuine farmers, as if a long life in the city has had no impact on them.</p>
<p>The old man is about forty or fifty years old, but he is very healthy. He is tall and thin, with a small head, graying hair, and small, deep-set eyes. However, with a small, pointed nose, his appearance is not too unpleasant. His voice is very loud, and he usually sounds like he is arguing when he talks to people. When I first moved in, because I didn't have a suitable place to put a mop, I temporarily placed it at the entrance of the stairs. When he saw it, he used his big throat to argue with the friend who was helping me move. My friend was so scared that he didn't dare to speak. I thought, "This is terrible! How come I didn't see such an old man when I looked at the house that day?"</p>
<p>Now I understand that he was born with such a voice, and he is not intentionally arguing with anyone. However, it is enough to make people suffer.</p>
<p>He plants flowers for a foreigner.</p>
<p>He loves to be greedy for small advantages. Even a piece of rusty wire is good for him. He often brings back many things from the foreigner, such as green paint, white paint, tung oil, and lime. These things are all contained in cigarette tins or other cans, carefully wrapped in newspapers, and carefully carried back. In the afternoon, when he has nothing to do, he picks up a can of paint and either paints the door green or the window white. You always see him painting non-stop. Therefore, the house is painted with patches of green, white, and black, making it look a mess. I think it might look good in his eyes. There are fresh flowers offered in front of their gods every day, which, needless to say, the old man brought back. He is very afraid of his wife – the witch. Whenever she is unhappy, or when he is talking loudly to someone, his wife lowers her face and says to him:</p>
<p>"What are you yapping about again?" Then he will run off to do something without saying a word. Naturally, he goes back to his painting.</p>
<p>The whole family is very frugal, eating very poorly, and dressing very poorly. The old man often says to others:</p>
<p>"Don't look at some people who dress very well? In truth, they can't even pay the rent."</p>
<p>Their eldest son is an apprentice in a leather shoe store and is the only handsome person in the family. He seems to have little connection with the family. He only comes back to sleep every night and leaves again at dawn.</p>
<p>The second son is a high school student in elementary school, about to graduate. Strangely, he doesn't show any dissatisfaction with his mother's business. He spends his summer vacation playing with cicadas with other children and helping his mother start the fire when cooking. I haven't seen him touch a single book. He is not young, sixteen or seventeen years old, and looks very tall. Once, I asked his mother:</p>
<p>"After he graduates from elementary school, does he plan to study further?"</p>
<p>"No, he won't study anymore. Don't you see those middle school students next door who have been idle at home for a long time? I don't have that much money to pay for his studies." She said with indignation.</p>
<p>She continued:</p>
<p>"My Gengdi can attend school because Guang Sheng agreed to only charge half the fee, for half a year in total." She also mentioned the reason why her second daughter went to school.</p>
<p>The second daughter is a spoiled child of seven or eight years old who has been spoiled, and cannot even distinguish between male and female teachers, as for the words in the books, she doesn't recognize a single one, but she can read very well along with others.</p>
<p>The eldest daughter looks very much like her mother, especially her big eyes with long, black eyelashes, which makes her look like a cunning spirit. However, her pale white face and her completely bony body are far inferior to those of her parents. She works in a cigarette factory, earning one and a half cents for packing enough cigarettes, but even such cheap work is not available every day. She mostly goes once every other day, or even faces long-term unemployment of more than a month.</p>
<p>Now I will talk about the main figure in this family – the witch. Judging from her appearance alone, she does not look as frighteningly strange as the average witch, and is not much different from an ordinary old woman in her forties or fifties. She is short and slightly plump, with black hair, large eyes, and long, black eyelashes. Her eyes blink very quickly when she speaks, and you can tell at a glance that she is a formidable old woman. Her right ankle is thicker than her left, and she doesn't walk very easily. She can heal people and scare away evil spirits from children. She relies on her Bodhisattva to heal adults and her own experience to heal children. Her business is not bad, and people often come to ask for fortunes. The prescriptions are printed on the fortune slips. As for how much money to give, it is up to the patient. I think this income is very limited. The main income comes from healing children's diseases, as people are willing to pay more for their own children. She doesn't have a set time; she sees people as they come, and it usually costs four or five cents each time. It is said that she can also get two or three yuan for a house call. Once, I saw her pick white spots from an infant's mouth with my own eyes. She calmly took out a needle more than an inch long from the medicine box, without sterilizing it. She opened the infant's mouth with one hand and put the needle in with the other, picking with a popping sound. Blood flowed out along her fingers, and the infant cried so hard that it lost its voice. The mother turned her head away and dared not look again. But she was still calmly picking, with no expression on her face, as if she were picking on a piece of wood. After the procedure was completed, she used a metal tube, placing a little white powder on one end and blowing it into the infant's mouth. When the other person left, they slipped a small roll of corner tickets into her hand, and she smiled, saying:</p>
<p>"Don't be polite!" As she slowly put it into her pocket.</p>
<p>Their Bodhisattva is kept in a glass box. Once, I asked her eldest daughter to open it for me to see, and she seriously refused:</p>
<p>"I can't open it!"</p>
<p>"Why not?" I asked strangely.</p>
<p>"We have to wait for my mother to come. She has fairy bones, and the Bodhisattva won't blame her." So I asked her where their "Madam Lü Chunyang" came from. She generously told me the reason why they worship the god: "We didn't worship gods before. Three years ago, my mother was sick in bed and couldn't move. My father was also sick and even vomited blood! One night, the Bodhisattva possessed my mother and told her to worship her because she had fairy bones. If we believed in her, their illnesses would get better. Later, they really got better. She also healed many other people."</p>
<p>"Then where did you get the Bodhisattva from?" I said, pointing to the idol.</p>
<p>She replied calmly, "We bought it in the city."</p>
<p>"Can Bodhisattvas be bought with money?" I almost shouted! But in reality, I vaguely said, "Hmm!" and mumbled past it.</p>
<p>This old woman doesn't have any other illnesses, except that she has a red erysipelas on her particularly thick right ankle, which flares up two or three times a month. When it flares up, she can't walk a single step and can only lie down, emitting terrible groans, and her husband, who likes to quarrel, also temporarily becomes mute.</p>
<h3>Today I Pay My Respects to Esthetes at Bai Causeway</h3>
<p>— Dabao</p>
<p>Today’s hurried journey,</p>
<p>Leaves my footprints on the Bai Causeway of West Lake.</p>
<p>I come here to seek the harmony of heaven,</p>
<p>To admire the resting place of the souls of esthetes.</p>
<p>Strolling in the wind on Bai Causeway,</p>
<p>I recall the ancient poets along the way—</p>
<p>They sang of sacred peace,</p>
<p>Sang of the beautiful spring,</p>
<p>The love of youth…</p>
<p>They gained the worship of later generations of men and women,</p>
<p>With immortal poems.</p>
<p>I pay my respects to all esthetes,</p>
<p>They represent the most noble souls of mankind,</p>
<p>They spread the song of happiness to the present and future generations—</p>
<p>First, I pay my respects to Bai Juyi,</p>
<p>He opposed war and sang of peace;</p>
<p>I pay my respects to Su Manshu,</p>
<p>He sang of transcending the world to relieve suffering;</p>
<p>I pay my respects to Su Xiaoxiao and Feng Xiaoqing,</p>
<p>Their lives themselves are moving songs.</p>
<p>Poets of peace,</p>
<p>Gallant courtesans,</p>
<p>After death, you rest forever by the beautiful lake,</p>
<p>Considered to have found the realm you sang of.</p>
<p>However, I want to, in the name of a reader,</p>
<p>Ask your peaceful tombs—</p>
<p>Is the tomb the final destination</p>
<p>Of the names of all ideals?</p>
<p>West Lake has tranquil waves,</p>
<p>The lakeside has gentle breezes and willows,</p>
<p>Ancient poets rest under the shade of the trees,</p>
<p>Modern tourists wander under the shade of the trees,</p>
<p>They come here to escape the noise of the city.</p>
<p>In the city, in the mortal world,</p>
<p>Humanity has lost its beauty and harmony.</p>
<p>Today, it is still a chaotic world!</p>
<p>We live under the butcher's knife;</p>
<p>Groups of unfortunate humans,</p>
<p>No one can escape the present world</p>
<p>They encounter hunger, suffering, and slaughter;</p>
<p>Hold back on singing about youth and love,</p>
<p>Everywhere is etiquette, conspiracy, and depravity!</p>
<p>Today I pay my respects to all esthetes at Bai Causeway,</p>
<p>Tomorrow,</p>
<p>Tomorrow the express train will take me back through the wilderness to the city of sin.</p>
<h3>The Place to Die</h3>
<p>— Qin Wen</p>
<p>The newspaper reported that a male coolie around forty years old, suffering from illness and without a place to stay, slept at night in a cement tile pipe placed by the Public Works Department on the open space of Route Massenet in the French Concession, and died of serious illness in the tile pipe. Mr. Neng Gong believed that "some people will see this corpse as a symbol of human barbarism and shame," and considered him a "silent witness."</p>
<p>After working hard all his life, he didn't even have a place to lie down and die properly, and had to secretly collapse in a tile pipe, which is sad enough. But there are coolies who die even more tragically; it is said that just last month, on the slope of the Jimei Wharf, there was a person lying there, so thin that there were only bones inside the skin. Presumably, he intended to take the Tongmei bus back to his hometown, but he was so sick that he couldn't walk or speak well; just as the tide was rising, the seawater soaked his body, and he勉强爬向岸边,勉强爬了一些路就停止了.潮水又涨到,才再爬一下。The tide rose again, and he would crawl a little further. To prevent the stench, they carried him to Xiamen, also on the wharf. The next day the tide rose again, but he still didn't die,苟延残喘,苟延残喘,苟延残喘,于是又这样：潮涨一点，他爬一下；再涨一点，再爬一下。脚是任凭浸着的，总要海水滚上了大腿，他才拚命挣扎。Compared to this, dying in the tile pipe seems better, as it would be quieter.</p>
<p>If you can still walk, you have to look for a tile pipe to die in. For people without a home to return to, tile pipes are worth paying attention to at all times!</p>
<p>Seeing such records and hearing such news, I am very surprised. This is not accidental; seven years ago, Yuan Qing rented a house in Yu Lou. Because the expo was about to open, Yu Lou could no longer be lived in, so he had to move to Ge Ling. It was expensive and far away, with many inconveniences, so he had to move again, squeezing into a small building in Guanghua Temple, which was extremely hot and stuffy. He became seriously ill and had no choice but to move to the school where I taught. It made me deeply feel that there was really no place to be sick and no place to die.</p>
<p>He had made many contributions in art, but it seemed that suffering was to be expected for things like painting.</p>
<p>Tile pipe! Is it really a destination?</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement</p>
<p>Talks</p>
<h3>What Exactly is the Inspection Office?</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>Clearly an organization that protects smuggling</p>
<p>Regarding the establishment of an inspection office by the Hebei-Chahar authorities, it was reported that after private goods in North China were inspected by the inspection office, they would only be subject to a consumption tax of one-eighth of the customs duty, and then they could be freely transported and sold in Hebei, Chahar, Tianjin, etc., without being considered private goods. After this news spread, the whole country was in an uproar and greatly shocked, believing that this system completely destroyed China's customs barrier and maintained a smuggling organization, letters and telegrams flew, and they questioned the Hebei-Chahar authorities about the truth.</p>
<p>The Hebei-Chahar authorities had no choice but to announce the reason for the establishment of the inspection office to the news reporters the other day. Their words were humorous and evasive, a series of excuses. They said that the task of the office was to investigate private goods. All private goods transported and sold within Hebei, Chahar, and Tianjin would be subject to an inspection fee and released, but not taxed. Those transported out of Hebei, Chahar, etc., would still be considered private goods. According to what the Hebei-Chahar authorities announced, after private goods in North China were inspected by the office, those sold in Hebei, Chahar, and Tianjin would not be considered private goods, and only those sold outside of Hebei, Chahar, and Tianjin would be considered private goods. I don't know why there is such a serious distinction between the Hebei-Chahar-Tianjin area and the non-Hebei-Chahar-Tianjin area? That is the first strange thing.</p>
<p>They also said that the inspection fee was not the same as collecting customs duties, but customs revenue is a major lifeline of the national economy. Foreign goods imported into China should pay taxes according to regulations. Why does the office only charge inspection fees for private goods that have not been taxed and allow them to be freely transported and sold? Such private goods should be confiscated and confiscated, which is the proper way. However, the office not only does not detain them, but also inspects and releases them. Once inspected, private goods become official goods, and everything is unimpeded. This kind of organization is clearly a smuggling protection organization. That is the second strange thing.</p>
<p>They also said that they can be freely transported and sold in Hebei, Chahar, and Tianjin, but those transported out of Hebei, Chahar, and Tianjin are still private goods. This treats Hebei, Chahar, and Tianjin as another world, another organization, completely unlike an area under the rule of China's central government. May I ask, what country's land is Hebei, Chahar, and Tianjin? What country's people? What country's politics? Since the puppet organization appeared, the land of several provinces outside the pass has existed in name only. Since the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee appeared, the land in the North China region is also unclear and cannot be investigated. That is the third strange thing.</p>
<p>The Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee is China's Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee. The members of the committee are all dispatched by the central government and appointed by the central government. The committee should be ruled by the central government and abide by China's laws. However, the statements it announces are completely unlike the statements of central government officials, but completely like the statements of a special organization. If this kind of organization is not fundamentally corrected, it will be tested in the areas outside the pass, and it will also be tested in North China. If it is promoted further in the future, I don't know what kind of country China will become, what kind of nation, and what kind of politics.</p>
<p>However, this measure has not satisfied the desires of ambitious people. Now, ambitious countries are singing loudly about adjusting Sino-Japanese relations and about clarifying North China. Then, in the current obscure and unclear situation, with the abnormally developing organization, there may be further changes and unpredictable crises. If I retreat one step, people will advance a hundred steps! If I retreat ten steps, people will advance a thousand steps. It is true that China's land has an end, but people's desires are insatiable. Those who bear the weight of the country should not think of this!</p>
<h3>School Starts</h3>
<p>— Shen Jiaqian</p>
<p>"The old woman runs a bank? Shameless!" She slapped the dazed Fusheng: "If you have the guts, get steady, what's the point of this stupid boy studying, put him in the shop to learn business. Dreaming with your eyes open, preparing to be the top scorer in the imperial examination?"</p>
<p>Fusheng stroked his burning face and looked at his father. His father just slowly retreated backward, crossing the counter, and only then opened his mouth as if he had something to protect him:</p>
<p>"Of course, you should study. After opening a cigarette and silver shop for a lifetime, I haven't seen a single penny (money), the child will be next year..." Liu Caifu couldn't remember that difficult name for a moment, so he asked Fusheng: "Isn't it next year...</p>
<p>Fusheng looked at his mother's face, and he guarded against the second slap, saying so softly: "Graduating next year."</p>
<p>"Isn't it? He's graduating next year. This child has never been held back a grade. It's better to graduate than to do business. These few coins have to be used."</p>
<p>The boss spoke, supporting himself on the counter with both hands in a protective posture, looking at Fusheng again, who was pitifully standing on one side. The boss's wife heard "graduate," and she didn't know what graduation was, but graduating from a Western school probably had some benefits, so she looked at the kerosene bill to calculate this tuition fee:</p>
<p>"How much money do you need? Let's see what this stupid boy graduates into?"</p>
<p>The boss was happy then. "Fusheng, you tell me, how much money do you need?" Fusheng read the note again, tuition twelve yuan, book fee four yuan, library fee one yuan, a total of seventeen yuan.</p>
<p>Then a customer ran up and threw two cents and said: "A pack of ×× brand."</p>
<p>The boss shot a glance at his wife, as if to say, "Look, isn't the ×× brand business very good?" While answering his customer, "Sorry, just sold out. How about □□ brand?"</p>
<p>The customer shook his head, took back the two cents, and left.</p>
<p>The boss's wife spat a mouthful of phlegm, "Damn! As if they can afford to smoke ×× brand." Grumbling, she walked into the inner room of the shop.</p>
<p>The boss deliberately said loudly to his son:</p>
<p>"Fusheng, after you eat, you watch the shop. I'm going to Beihai to wholesale cigarettes."</p>
<p>Naturally, he was thinking, "Women don't understand things!"</p>
<h3>Let's Go Eat!</h3>
<p>— Sheli</p>
<p>——One of Travel Notes——</p>
<p>——Guest! Let's go eat!</p>
<p>——Let's go eat! Let's go eat!</p>
<p>In my dream, I was suddenly awakened by this sound. I opened my eyes, the sun had just appeared, it was still early.</p>
<p>Here, is a broken building, two shops across from each other. Don't dislike the dirtiness, in this small hotel, this is considered a special room. In the big house outside, there are beds everywhere, and bedbugs can fight on the straw mats at will, that is the pigsty.</p>
<p>Downstairs is a restaurant, selling rice, 粥 (congee), all kinds of noodles, but the side dishes are only cheap goods; none of the customers here can afford a dish that costs two dimes.</p>
<p>Although the town is small, because this is the main road into the city, there are many people coming and going. There are several shops on the street selling "home-style meals" and offering lodging for traveling merchants.</p>
<p>It seems like fate, last night's wind and rain still kept me here.</p>
<p>I didn't expect that in this quiet small town, these noisy sounds would ring out so early in the morning.</p>
<p>I got up resentfully, leaning on the windowsill and looking down at the street;</p>
<p>On the street: several country people walked by hurriedly. In the restaurants, this one, that one, the boss, the waiter, all crowded at the door, waving to those country people, opening their mouths, shouting:</p>
<p>——Guests, let's go eat——</p>
<p>——Order some rice before you leave——</p>
<p>The landlady downstairs from us was also smiling hard, shouting loudly.</p>
<p>Those country people seemed a little timid, lowering their heads and walking straight on.</p>
<p>The street temporarily quieted down.</p>
<p>However, when I went downstairs to wash my face, suddenly the noisy sound flew up again. The landlady, holding a washbasin, hurriedly put the washbasin in front of me and rushed to the door. Immediately I heard her voice. I turned my head: three figures had just flashed past the door.</p>
<p>The landlady's voice stopped, with disappointment on her face.</p>
<p>——What's the point of shouting? If people want to eat, they will eat; if they don't eat, it's no use shouting until your throat is broken!</p>
<p>I don't sympathize with her disappointment. I think it's stupid to use this kind of slogan-like method to attract customers.</p>
<p>She glanced at me and walked towards me:</p>
<p>——Guest! You don't know, in the past, country people coming to the city always rested here and ate something, but in recent years, things are not right. If you shout, they are still unwilling to come. If you don't shout, even less people will come. Country people are very bad!</p>
<p>——It's not their fault, the times are bad, where do country people get the money to eat?</p>
<p>The waiter interjected from the side.</p>
<p>I didn't say anything. I think the waiter's words are right, and the landlady's shouting is using aural temptation, which is not wrong in the business world. Many shops in the city also have their waiters wear paper hats and stand at the door shouting during auctions; it's a pity that this kind of temptation has lost its effect in the current "bad times."</p>
<p>Just as I was thinking this, the voices became noisy again:</p>
<p>——Let's go eat!</p>
<p>——Let's go eat!</p>
<p>It is a double cry of hunger!</p>
<h3>The Authority of God</h3>
<p>— Rui Zhi</p>
<p>——Random Notes from Mountain Living——</p>
<p>Coming to live in the mountains and forests, this is the second time in my life.</p>
<p>On a sweltering afternoon, a friend asked me to go to his hometown. He said, "People only know to go to famous mountains like Qingwu to escape the summer heat, but my hometown also has mountains and rivers and large forests. It doesn't cost much money, and it's quieter than famous summer resorts. It should be a good place for us poor scholars!" Hearing what my friend said, I finally left the stuffy and noisy metropolis that evening and came to this quiet and beautiful mountain.</p>
<p>In the city, I was stuck sitting in that attic above ninety degrees every day. It seemed like I was tired and without energy all day long. But when I got here, everything changed. The beauty of nature's scenery, the lives and laughter of the mountain people, all transformed me, who was trapped in the city like a little crow, into an energetic wild cat.</p>
<p>The summer countryside is lovely. At daybreak, birds are chirping on the eaves. The face of the rising sun, like an egg yolk, rises behind the mountain slope. It doesn't make people feel disgusted at all. Its light shines on the fields in the valley. Every ray of golden light glitters like countless golden rivers. The farmers, carrying their farm tools or riding on the backs of oxen, sing ditties and mountain songs, beginning their work in the golden sunlight. In the afternoon, the sun climbs to the treetops. The old banyan trees, which require both arms to encircle, cast patches of shade. Sitting and chatting, gazing at the green of the distant mountains and the turquoise streams, a cool breeze blows. The scorching sun in the mid-sky seems to have lost its authority, as lovely as the winter sun. The village children riding on the backs of oxen are as elegant as in famous paintings, stirring the remaining golden water waves in the mountain stream. The earth is silent, only the soft sound of leaves playing a lullaby for the afternoon nap.</p>
<p>At midnight, the moon leaps out from the black shadows of the distant mountains. A line of snow-white silver light shoots into the gauze window. Gazing at the wilderness, the forests are all white. The shadows of the trees in front of the window move, and the moonlight seems to be undulating in the water, sometimes bright, sometimes dark. A gentle breeze blows, and the fields seem to be filled with countless lovers whispering. Fireflies fly by, like shooting stars streaking across the sky. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Cao Xiaoying's Jade Dragonfly</p>
<p>Zhongxi (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening: "Pipa of Xunyang"</p>
<p>Sima Xiangshan, Jiangzhou. Anchored at the ancient ferry of Xunyang at night. Seeing off guests sadly, sharing farewell. Reed flowers and maple leaves in the autumn evening of the river. Thinking that I am, lamenting the official life, drifting like duckweed. A farewell banquet held as the sail is raised on the water. Gazing at the moon in the center of the river, the sound of drums has reached the second watch. Suddenly, the sound of lamentations rises on all sides, tuning the strings. Asking where, the sorrowful sound is like a complaint. Therefore, the host and guests approach the neighboring boat. Asking her to come closer, she appears half shy. Seeing her, Aunt Qiu is still graceful, adding a cup of wine to the table. Listening to her, recounting her life, filled with old dreams. Alas, spring flowers and autumn moon do not remain. The phoenix strings follow the tune of the silver plectrum. Who knows, the mandarin duck curtains are empty, longing for the fallen jade hook. Past events are unbearable to look back on. Countless unspeakable words are told from the beginning. Seeing her, the remaining rouge and powder are only regrets. Blood-stained skirt of old pomegranate color. Later, the carriages and horses gradually thinned, sadly desolate. How could she marry the floating Liang husband and leave? Just like, autumn wind abandons the palace silk fan. The crescent moon is hard to repair with the jade axe. Knowing that, from ancient times, the pleasure ground is like the official sea. Changes in the world go on and on. I am also, a drifting traveler like you. At the end of the road, sympathetic tears meet. But, the pipa of Xunyang has a thousand years of hatred. I advise you, play another song, what more can you ask? It's just that, I have nothing to give you as a gift, so I turn it into a new melody and offer it as a song. When the song ends, the wine is gone, and people leave, a sound is heard from the returning horses. I feel that, red powder and blue shirt, tears flow together.</p>

<p>Shanghai (1100) 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM Opening: "Guan Shoufeng's Night Exploration of the Tiger's Den"</p>
<p>The affairs of the world are like a game of chess, weighed on a scale. The changes of the wind and clouds stir up dust. Since ancient times, how many infatuated people have there been. After experiencing the vicissitudes of life, feeling the past and present. Thinking that I am, a chivalrous heart and proud bones. Ten years of wandering the rivers and lakes. Lamenting my own life as a mayfly, accustomed to being in the world, not fair. Jia Shu's public love has changed to joy. Full of love and affection. Before leaving, he entrusted the important love affairs. I should keep a little of my heart. Who knows that Fengxi is a flower bud envied by wind and rain. Who will come to protect the flower bell. Only regret that, mistakenly entering the tiger's den, her beautiful face is imprisoned. Spring locks the heavy door, and no one is seen. Allowing her to drop tears and cry like a cuckoo in the night moon. The embroidered curtains are lonely, weeping in the twilight. Fortunately, the secret message is passed by the mother. Suddenly touching the hero's listening ears. So, risking his life to explore the tiger's den. There is a wall to listen to, an ear close to the wall. Secretly looking at, the general has not changed his slave state. From time to time, he begs for a beauty with a flattering face. Moreover, strings of pearls and rare treasures are dazzling. Yaqin is entrusted to mediate. Unexpectedly, the daughter has changed her love to golden objects. She only values gold, not love. Since ancient times, the field of love has been full of changes. Gold can buy a beautiful woman's heart. Knowing that, the mirror is a flower in the water and the moon in the mirror, empty into a shadow. Regretting that, suspecting rain and cloud, pretending to be true. But I, witnessing the situation, often sigh. It is difficult to suppress the tide of anger for a while. I can't wait to cut off this kind of love for you. Don't fail the deep trust of that year. Alas, the son's infatuation is like a dream, sadly becoming a consequence that changes the cause. Therefore, a letter is sent quickly, telling him to say goodbye to his parents and set off. Just as well...</p>

<p>Opening: "National Flower"</p>
<p>Although the plum blossom is not the king of flowers. Its character is pure and outstanding. Since ancient times, poets have praised it. The fame of the flower queen is unparalleled in the world. The chrysanthemum is a recluse among flowers. The lotus is also worthy of a gentleman. Zhou Zi loved lotus, and Tao loved chrysanthemum. The interests of the two are very unusual. Don't know, the plum blossom combines reclusive and gentlemanly qualities. Its nature is gentle, its character is high, and its appearance is dignified. People in the world often praise peaches and plums. Peach blossoms are gorgeous, and plum blossoms are fragrant. That plum blossom only settles in peace. Unwilling to follow the fashion and learn new makeup. The beauty of the world is unrestrained and vulgar. Ashamed to compete with peaches and plums for fragrance. Without a good matchmaker, what harm is there? The fairy of Miaogu has no lover. Friends in the mountains are pine and bamboo. The night is clear wind, the moon and frost. Those ordinary flowers only listen to orders. Who can occupy the spring first? So it is said that the new moon unfolds its eyebrows and the stars shine. The old plum opens its mouth, and hundreds of flowers are busy. Who knows the ancient times? Only to say that the eyes of the world are blind. But unexpectedly, there is still Lin Hejing with affection. To say about the voice of Meng Xiangyang. And now the national flower is determined to be more glorious.</p>

<h3>Star Information</h3>
<p>A party to entertain all walks of life is currently being actively prepared. On the vast square of the Fenglin Bridge Main Factory, many colored buildings are being built, similar to the memorial archways at the West Lake Exposition, designed by Wan Guchan.</p>
<p>The Screenwriting Committee has recently established the Star Library, ordering various central drama and film books and newspapers, and major bookstores have donated books and newspapers, especially the Tianma Bookstore, which has given various series of books.</p>
<p>The main factory's "Women's Rights," "Night Party," "Eternal Smile," and the Alber Road Second Factory's "Loyal Hearts in Life and Death" and "Qingming Season" are being actively filmed these days and will be completed around the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>On the vast open-air photography field, there is now a very beautiful garden, dance floor, and grape arbor, everything is available. The visit is all for the new construction, in fact, this is the garden hotel scenery in "Night Party."</p>
<p>The shooting field of Factory One has recently been transformed into a magnificent hall, which is the charity dance party of celebrities in "Women's Rights." The vastness of the entire shooting field can be imagined.</p>
<p>Shen Xiling's new work "Crossroads" will be launched after "Loyal Hearts in Life and Death," and most of the leading actors are newcomers.</p>
<h3>"Water Music House" Song and Dance Venue</h3>
<h3>Seeking "Yegor Bulychov"</h3>
<p>Yegor Bulychov is an important character in Gorky's posthumous work "Yegor Bulychov and Others." It is very, very difficult to create a character like the one Gorky portrayed. This play is being rehearsed by the Haiyan Drama Troupe. Haiyan is a drama group composed entirely of newcomers, and they have spent four or five months of hardship. No one has ever paid attention to them or supported them. They humbly bury themselves in research everywhere.</p>
<p>Now, they feel that this role in rehearsal is somewhat unsuitable and need to find a more wholesome actor to play it. It has been decided to extend the date of the premiere and to seek another actor to play the role of "Bulychov." He must be tall, fluent in Mandarin, have a loud voice, and slightly wide cheekbones. Anyone who thinks they have such talent, please contact the company at No. 7 Huatongfang, Beixizang Road Bridge, every day from 2 PM to 7 PM.</p>
<h3>"Cow Nose" The Third Collection of Blessing Series Will Be Published</h3>
<p>Huang Yao's "Cow Nose," the first humorous cartoon book in China, has published the first two collections, which have been selling well both domestically and abroad, reaching more than 20,000 copies. It has won high praise from the United States, Germany, England, Japan, and other countries, which believe that "it brings together the comedic points of the Chinese people to develop pure Chinese rich jokes, introduces China's unique humor, and truly makes people wake up from sleep. Reminiscing at any time and laughing uncontrollably, it is not only interesting and profound but also contains satire. Its style is unique in the international cartoon world, using extremely simple lines. It can draw very lively movements and delicate expressions, which is even more rare. The protagonist's half-nose face and body are organized and very easy to learn. Therefore, both young and old like to imitate and draw, recognizing this cow nose as a representative of Chinese comedy." The first collection has been published in three editions, and the second collection has been republished. They are all published by the China Book Company on Fuzhou Road in this city. Now, the third collection has been compiled with excellent works, and there is also a "Blessing Collection," which is all single-panel satirical paintings, purely performed by Cow Nose, still taking a humorous tone, satirizing all social figures. The cover is printed in four colors, which is even more magnificent. The selling price is still set at 15 cents, and it is currently being compiled and will be published soon.</p>
