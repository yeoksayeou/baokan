<h3 id="c47">日本記者　與羅斯之問答 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>謂日本可有諒解英無單獨行動意</p>
<p>（東京）李滋羅斯與新聞記者團之問答悄形如下、</p>
<p>記者　閣下力說英日在中國之恊力、然英國關於中國以外諸國之通商問題、有無與日本恊力之意、</p>
<p>羅斯　英日兩國在中國以外之諸外國、對於通商問題、爲恊力之問題、曾於前年日英會商討論、據余意見、日貨在英國以外之各國、受阻害輸入之原因、在於生產過度、欲緩和如此狀態、須要拂除無益競爭、日本自身亦要反省、</p>
<p>記者　　排除競爭之時、如英國領士廣大資源豐富之國、獲得利益、而如日本領士狹小、資原窮乏之國、極爲不利、在此塲合、英國有無對日本與以便利之準偕、</p>
<p>羅斯　此項質問、不能諒解、日本資源雖窮乏、然可由外國廉價購置原料品、因此日本欲打開現在難關、應限制生產、而提高貨價、英國不僅於在中國、擬根基於互相的恊定、在任何塲合實行競爭、</p>
<p>記者　閣下對於日本在束洋特殊地位之意見如何、</p>
<p>羅斯　日本爲東洋之安定勢力、負有重大責担、</p>
<p>記者　本當局之見解、認現在實行對華經濟援助、時期尙早、政治的解决、乃是應先實行之條件、閣下今次來日、對日政府提議對華鐵路之投資、及是正華北走利之必要、使吾人抱閣下爲中國政府代辯者之感念、然據日政府意見、閣下應對中國政府勸告、使其更正對日態度、然則其結果、對於打開中日關係、亦有相當貢獻、閣下對此意見如何、</p>
<p>羅斯　余非中國政府之代辯者、余僅爲自己目的視察中國、諸君慫恿余勸吿中國政府、然余爲經濟專家、不願干涉政治問題、又日本現有意見主張撲滅中國共產黨、中國內地民衆生活困難、故有共產黨之存在、欲撲滅中國共產黨、須要安定其民衆生活、在中國建設鐵路、改善農民生活狀態、則可使日貨輸出可能、對於日本產業家與以利益、</p>
<p>記者　建設鐵路、以中國何地方爲目標、</p>
<p>羅斯　中國爲世界中最少鐵路之國、故應在各她方建設鐵路、</p>
<p>記者　日本政府聞將以物質行使對華援助、此事已得到具體方案吾、</p>
<p>羅斯　具體方案尙未决定、但余聞日本政府有此意向、至感愉快、</p>
<p>記者　若日本不欲對華共同援助之際、英國是吾單獨援助、倘單獨行使援助、則其程度若何、</p>
<p>羅斯　日本政府旣已表示具有共同援華之意向、故余認爲現在當不致發生此種問題、</p>
<p>記者　對於中國建設鐵道以及中央銀行之改組問題、日本政府有無具體提案、</p>
<p>羅斯　在中國提高對外信用之際、不能提出該項具體方案、由此項對外信用進步上觀之、則中國之關稅問題、含有重大意義、對於此事、當有明顯之記述、至於中央銀行之改組、余亦曾相當盡力、中國當局目下亦極形努力中、但其具體之成效、則不得而知、</p>
<p>記者　然則中央銀行改組之主要目標若何、</p>
<p>羅斯　其組織欲倣效日本銀行、從而促成者也、</p>
<p>記者　日前在華府成立之中美新恊定、尊見若何、</p>
<p>羅斯　該案並未正式發表、故其內容不得而知、但對於中國有益、已不待論、不過此事與英國毫無關係、</p>
<p>記者　據謂中國關稅收入之增减、在中國復興上具有重大意義、但不知此項解决辦法若何、爲解决此事、認爲與日本應以任何恊助爲必要、</p>
<p>羅斯　中國關稅收入之减少、當以銀價變動與華北「特殊貿易」爲其主耍原因、但此項解决辦法、乃爲政治問題、余未便發表意見也云云、（十三日同盟電）</p>

<p>美國總統選舉形勢　羅斯福可當選連任　共和黨推諾克斯候選副總統波拉對蘭登金融政策有異議</p>
<p>（華盛頓）甘薩斯州州長蘭登與芝加哥報紙發行人諾克斯雖被選爲共和黨候選正副總統、而現任總統羅斯福在總統選舉運動中仍佔優勢、中立觀察家以爲蘭登與諾克斯之獲選、不致餒重危及羅斯福之機會、恒街對羅斯福膺選預測之賭博、爲八對五之比、（十二日路透電）</p>

<p>— 紀難</p>
<p>一七六三年英國即結束「七年戰爭」而以印度爲其屬地，一八八六年（清光緒十二年）更進而取得緬甸，破我屏藩，於是我國西南之門戶洞開，而滇緬疆界之勘定，遂爲當務之急。</p>
<p>按滇緬疆界，在清乾嘉間，聞以大金沙江爲天然界綫。迨英亡緬甸，我駐英公使曾紀澤與英外相克雷交涉之際，仍力主以大金沙江爲界。然當時並未訂立界約，僅互書節略，作爲存案而已。直至一八九四年（光緒二十年）我駐英公使薛福成與英外相勞思伯力交涉劃界，始有中英續義滇緬條約之訂立。該約將滇緬疆界以北緯二十五度三十五分與東經九十八度十四分之尖高山爲中心而分爲南北兩段。南段自尖高山起，西南至太平江爲第一段界綫；太平江與庫弄河（即葛龍江）相會處起，西南至瑞麗江爲第二段界綫；瑞麗江與孟卯合流處起，東南至湄江爲第三段界綫。並簽定滇緬界圖作爲附件。而北段（北緯二十五度三十五分以北）則因野人山爭執而留爲懸案。一八九六年（光緒二十二年）中法訂立滇越條約，將猛島島得割讓於法，英國認爲兩地乃江洪界內之地，與中英續議滇緬稱約第五條「未經中英預先議定，中國不得將盂連與江洪之全地或片圭讓與別國」之義相違，要求另立新約。於是又訂立一八九七年（光緒二十三年）中緬條約附欵十九條，大致與原約相同，惟界綫向東推進，我國損失更甚。一八九九年（光緒二十五年）中英雙方合肥市約派員勘定南段疆界，不意又生波折，而第三段之南帕南定兩河相匯處至南馬河注入南卡江處一節未能勘定。當時我方劉萬勝與陳燦根據條約所附之薛使界圖將班洪（上葫蘆）所屬各地歸滇，班況（下葫蘆）所屬各地歸緬，循猛林山，帕唱山，公明山，至南卡江，以山脊河流爲界，將猛角，猛董，盂連土司歸滇。而英方忽持異議，指瀾滄縣附近之孔明山爲公明山，欲將猛角所屬之猛戛，拱弄，拱勇，小猛弄各地與盂連所屬之猛撥及西盟各地歸緬，顯與約文不符。其間經彼此之迭次讓步與折衷，總計前後交涉之界綫共分黃藍紫綠紅五色，即所謂南段之五色界綫，茲分別略述於次：</p>
<p>黃色綫即劉萬勝與陳燦按照薛圖之初定綫。係由南帕南定兩河相滙處起，循高山，過猛林山，順山脊，經帕唱山，過大南滾河，登光坎山，至公明山，循山脊徧東，渡南馬河，經山通岩成而至南卡江，順江至南水河滙流處而止。將猛林山東之班洪所屬，帕唱山東永邦各寨，猛角所轄之拱弄，拱勇，猛茅，公明山東各野寨，南卡江西之岩成山通諸野卡，及鎭邊，盂連土司所轄各均歸滇屬。猛林山西之班弄所屬，帕唱山西之班況各寨，及公明山，南卡江以西各野卡，如十一家召華，糯坎烏，下蟒冷各地均歸緬屬。</p>
<p>藍色綫即劉萬勝與陳燦之擬讓綫。按照黃色綫登光坎山後，偏東至南懶山，又東略北至安敦山，再東略南至南瓦山，東南至黑河頭之班定後山轉西，循南馬南項兩河之分水嶺至弄球山，沿斜坡而下，至南卡江源，順江至南永河滙流處而止。將班洪與猛角所轄之信阿，猛戛各寨，鎭邊，里長所屬之璽令，班定各寨，庫杏，南項，弄球山，西盟山，及南卡江東岸之官得，永廣，蠻弄，冷坎，邦北，庸黑，蘇幸各寨均屬滇。紹興，紹巴，上下困馬，山通，岩成，十一家召華，諸卡地均屬緬。</p>
<p>紫色綫即部示綫。按照藍色綫登光坎山後折東至糯果山，向南至南懶山，偏東至安敦山，繞至南瓦山，順山脊而行，東南至黑河北海之班定後山，轉西至庫杏河頭，循河，至南項河滙流處，再順下至南卡江而仍與藍色綫合。是則南北兩端完全與藍色綫相合，而中部向東推進，雖庫杏河東之那卡，籠美，尖猛，猛梭屬之茅壽，博項，黑拉，及南項河南之他郎，南丙各寨仍在滇境，而庫杏河西之作柯，班欠，年呵，及西盟山之永挺，果角，完礦，班戛，班師各寨均歸緬有矣。</p>
<p>綠色綫即英員司格德之議減綫。其北段與此色綫過多全相同，惟至庫杏河與南項河匯合處，則向南循山脊而下，經班順，富岩，邦北，庫黑而至南卡江，然後與藍色綫（即紫色綫）相合。如是則他郎，南丙，官得，富郎，童板，永廣，蠻弄，冷坎，邦北等寨均歸緬界。</p>
<p>紅色線即英員司格德自劃線。係由南帕南定兩河相滙處起，順山脊而行，至猛林山北，偏東經南板，班洪，信阿各地，沿山脊南下至糯果山，向南折東至南瓦山，復向東北，經蠻令，再沿南袋大山經黑河頭至班定，然後循庫杏河東湄潞二江之分水嶺南下，至鎭邊屬邦糯西面，向西南循湄潞二江之分水嶺，而與綠色綫合。如是則北之班洪，信阿，猛戛，拱弄，小猛弄，蠻令各地及中之那卡，籲美，法猛，黑拉，茅壽，猛梭，博項各地均劃歸緬界。</p>
<p>上述劃界情形，北段（尖高山以北）既成懸案，而南段（尖高山以南）又因界綫各執，勘而未定，且英方更藉口我方所用地圖並非薛勞兩大臣簽定之原圖，而堅主以紅線定界，交涉遂無結果，而中英法修緬劃界事宜因之停頓，延四十年而未決。民元以來，國家多故，邊疆問題，無暇顧及。而英人潛移界橋，越境耕種等無形霸佔，時有所聞。在彼任意侵略，本不以疆界爲重，自無急求勘定之必要。然其覬覦東侵之念，初不以疆界未定而稍戢。況北段之野人山正與揚子江發源地密邇，爲打通長江之捷徑；南段之班洪，礦產極多，富源所在，尤爲英人朝夕垂涎之地。二十三年之片馬事件與江心坡事件，即其利用北段未定界以伸展勢力於川康，希圖直下長江流域之野心之表現。同年之班範例事件則爲其南段未定界內之活動，目的在攫取礦權。</p>
<p>我西南邊疆既迭遭蠶食，政府乃重申前議，提議派員勘界，於是乃有二十四年四月中英會勘滇緬南段界務委員會之設立，由中英各派二人，及國聯行政院主席選派中立委員一人組織之。自該委會成立而後，一年於茲，勘界工作開始未久，即以滇邊瘴氣甚烈，無法勘察而暫停工作。乃不幸於此延宕未決之時，本年二月二十一日忽有英兵二百餘人突入滇境，佔領瀾滄縣屬之景冒地方，設置種種軍事工程。其意蓋在造成「既成事實，以爲勘界時侵佔之藉口。惟勘界委員澈查之結果，則謂實係英方測量隊之誤會，而返京委員發表談話亦謂勘界經過頗稱順利。然吾人對於英之侵入景冒，雖未敢必其具有若何嚴重之意義，而界務前途之荊棘尚多，則可斷言也。」</p>
<p>考爭執所在之南段五色界線，即依黃色線而論，較諸一八八六年英亡緬甸後曾使所訂以大金沙江爲天然界限之節略，所讓已多。況復根據一八九四年中英續議滇緬條約及一八九七年中緬條約附欵爲準，自無再事退讓之理。吾人觀乎迭次勘界之枝節橫生，久懸不決，其責任之誰屬，明若觀火。則今後中英法滇緬劃界之能否順利進行，當視英人之有無誠意及是否能本公平之精神，從歷史上地理上勘定一合理之界綫爲斷耳。</p>

<p>— 性病專家詹念曾醫師報告</p>
<p>（診所）上海北京路四川路轉角中國信託公司二樓　（門診）上午十時至下午六時星期日休息</p>
<p>遺精病理及其治法</p>
<p>本症起因多由秉賦薄弱及手淫斷喪而起。患者遺洩成慣。精關既鬆弛。生殖腺亦衰頹。治法以固精為先。「希米脫氏固精片」主之。培補莫廢。「生殖素」最效。取其補力宏偉。藥力直達生殖腺也。春初余迭用以治愈湯君鄭君之遺精夢洩。失眠健忘。上月余用以治愈魏吳二君之大便遺精。面黃肌瘦等症。均克奏取美滿之特效。為期均未愈月云。</p>
<p>早洩性弱電藥並施</p>
<p>性神經衰弱患者獨多。咸由手淫戕傷房勞過度而起。亦有因花柳惡症摧毀而起者。其病源胥在生殖腺素之缺乏。與生殖腺之衰頹。對症發藥自以「生殖素」為最效。如　　工廠之章君。余用以起其上述沉疴。輔以電療。為期祗三旬左右云。</p>
<p>腎虧腰痠體顫背疼</p>
<p>神經系統。密佈全身。全仗生殖腺素之營養。如生殖腺素缺乏或失常。則神經衰弱。各症蜂起。腰痠背疼。其最先之預兆也。對症發藥。治療最速。上月有九江許君。來訴有腎虧腰痠。體顫背疼等症。余即用「生殖素」令其內服。為期不及三星期。即告健全。欣欣稱謝而去云。</p>
<p>胃病骨痛須治痛因</p>
<p>疼痛者。症象現於外之警告也。萬全之法。在治痛因。如僅止痛。則不啻加以掩飾。徒使人失去警惕。而使病患愈形深重也。如前月有常州邵君。來訴有遠年胃痛及骨痛肢麻等症。迭藥未效。余囑向五洲藥房指購「胃痛靈」及強斯登氏「骨痛片」治其痛因。而用「健胃素」培補其弱胃。用「生殖素」調理其病軀。速服四五盒。各症盡失。回復重來未有之壯健。如慶再造云。</p>
<p>月經不調白帶纏棉</p>
<p>婦女環境拘束。一羅隱病。輒自諱秘。延醫不便。服藥無從。身心痛苦。莫可告述。去冬有嚴夫人由其至戚某女士介紹來診。訴有月經失常。白帶轉黃之苦。余囑向太和藥房購內服「女用生殖素」外用「療帶靈」內外兼施。匝月而瘳。不惟乳房　腴。且重返當年少婦時代之青春美。上月承介紹其二妹來治停經不孕等症。得悉已懷孕有四五個月之久云。</p>
<p>遺精失眠未老先衰</p>
<p>精為人身之至寶。腦血全身之營養賴之。如精薄而枯。則種種衰弱症患蜂起。故遺精患者。每訴有腦弱失眠。血枯面黃。肌瘦早老等症。如上月有倪黃二君。所訴雷同。余囑向中英藥房購服「希米脫氏固精片」主治其遺洩外。並投服「生殖素」培補其精血。腦髓神經。立見繁營連服半打重返其少壯時代應有之青春狀態云。</p>

<h3 id="c148">田徑選撥的總檢討 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— 槐青</p>
<p>自出席世運田徑人選發表後，所引起外界的誹議，真是「盛囂塵上」，洋洋乎大觀了。籃球隊的爭論早已過去；足球隊的所謂業餘事件的「馬後砲」，也稱尾斐；而現在田徑選拔的錯誤事件，愈加擴大了。爲了出席世界運動會而成了國內體育界「多事之秋」，豈是始料所及！「言者淳淳，聽者藐藐」，也豈是當事者應由的態度？</p>
<p>田徑選拔的錯誤，已成不可諱飾之事實。全國體協會董事會的議決，不啻成了「一紙具文」，選拔的方式和標準，完全把這議決案推翻，臨時以少數人的舒張，更以「人」的問題，不通盤籌劃，纔鑄成目前的大錯。現在想根據事實逐條的分析。但我得聲明，對於已當選的選手，都表示敬意，並沒有什麽歧視之意；對於落選的選手，也並不代抱不平，特別為其張目；對於當局者也沒有射門呢惡意；完全依照展開在我們面前的事態，作一整個的檢討。</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>根據全國體育協進會的法定刊物－「體育季刊」第二卷第一期載：「二十五年一月二十七日第三任董事第二次會議紀錄第四項載：聘請及追認參加世運會各項運動選拔委員名單，並定選拔原則如下：　品性良正，　成績優異，　年齡較幼而具有造就之希望者。田徑及游泳選拔委員馬約翰（召集者）容啟兆，周家騏，……另定參加預選成績標準」。</p>
<p>田徑及游泳選拔委員三人，容啟兆已領中國足球隊出國，周家騏也已先期出國，除先會晤在爪哇徵戰的足球隊外，再赴德國佈置一切。祗有馬約翰尚在國內，正負責此次田徑選拔及訓練事宜。容周二君出國後，對於田徑選委未見有代理的人員公佈，那末這次選拔事宜，是不是全由馬氏一人主持？抑由全國體協會其他要員共同負責？又何勿先事公佈？</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>又據全國體協會同一期的體育季刊上載：「參加世運預選田徑成績及格標準表」的男子成績，與這次預選的成績，作一比較如下：</p>
<p>（註　×二百公尺第一位英人鮑文，成績二二秒七，拋落劉君有五六公尺之遠。當時因劉君為第二名並無確定之時間發表。據十一日時事新報所載蔣湘青君之「田徑選拔之批評」文中所載為二十三秒四）</p>
<p>上列表中並沒有十項運動和馬拉松的參加預選標準，即在預選當天的秩序裏也並沒有補選，那末這兩項預定不派選手是無疑的了。直到對抗的場　，忽然播音機裏播出了十項運動測騐；既不公佈，又不聲明，用怎樣的理由可以說十項運動派選手是合法的？又用怎樣的理由說是派馬拉松選手是非違法的？更以現所公佈的選手中，他們的成績，是否都已及格了標準成績，參加預選，尚且要及格標準成績，那末選拔世運選手的成績標準，至少也要及到預選的標準，且更當勝過這項預選標準成績是鐵一般無可異議的了。</p>
<p>又參加預選標準成績表裏，也有女子成績，所定的標準如下：</p>
<p>既有女子預選標準成績，而所報參加女子預選的人，共有九名，除李森外，餘都沒有參加，這是她們自己放棄。由田徑選委的召集者馬約翰先生爲什麽要對新聞記者發表談話，說是「至於女子體育，本人素極提倡，惟觀乎成績及生理未有適當保護之前，參加世運似尚嫌太早」。（此段談話見六月六日上海各報）既已定出女子參加預選標準，這當然是想派女選手的；而馬先生又爲什麽要說「參加世運似尚嫌太早」？因之，預選那天報名的女選手的不出席，可說都是爲了馬先生這一句話。然而女子參加世運既嫌太早，又爲什麽要派一名女選手去參加？這是怎麼解說的？</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>預選成績標準和選拔原則，既有公佈，當然要遵照決意公佈的辦理。人選定十二人，自北平訓練班結束和結束後，馬約翰先生和劉長春（訓練班隊長）曾一再表示人選意欲增至十六人，當劉君到了上海後，也曾對新聞記者表示過。增至十六人原無不可，但全國體協會並沒有正式公告，直至人選發表後，果真增至十六名了。而且預選秩序裏沒有的節目也派有代表，不及格預選標準成績的也當選了，幾個預選標準成績的也有落選了的；這樣言行不一致，根本推翻了選拔標準，這是違背「行政」的原則。難道全國體育界領袖對於這麼大的事，可以這樣玩忽的麼？</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>現在要講到十項運動代表張齡佳的問題。自這問題經人指責以後，馬約翰先生立即來一個解說。他說：『……十項運動代表張齡佳，外界認為選拔不當，不知張君之苦幹精神甚佳，而其對於心理學頗有研究，吾國此次參加世運，原係觀摩性質，參加十項，得益較多。而張君回國後，已決定為體育界服務。……』我們不反對派十項運動代表，但爲什麽事前不公佈，給他人也有同樣的機會？更以張君的成績是否合乎「成績優異」的原則？張君的「苦幹精神甚佳……回國後已決定為體育界服務」，為要成績提高，誰沒有這種苦幹精神？誰便可說回國後決定不為體育界服務？這話很不合邏輯。而且張君的運動時代已經過去。既非「年齡較幼」又不是「成績優異」。據董寅初君的「質疑」第三條「十項選手張齡佳在清華大學一覽上，列為體育部助教，此點與業餘資格是否衝突？」（見十七日時事新報）董君既在清華大學一覽上發現張君為體育部助教，諒不是捏造誣諂的。如是，他已不是一位業餘運動者了。那末所謂「苦幹精神」，和「回國後已決定為體育界服務」，「參加十項獲益較多」云云，都有了語病，是很明顯的了。事關國家體面，決不可這樣玩忽溺職。既如此，所有關於十項運動選手張君的論爭，應該完全推翻，立刻取消了張君的代表權。足球的業餘文體已鬧得夠可以了，我們不希望田徑再有這種丟臉的事。而且馬約翰也曾談，關於李惠堂的問題。他說：「李惠堂事件，有關國家體面，主張嚴查」；我們應該請馬先生以身作則，把張齡佳的資格，先來「嚴查」一下。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>誠如馬先生說：「張君的苦幹精神甚佳」，「回國後已決定為體育界服務」，我應該再補充一句「張君的品性良正」。張君有久遠的運動生活，而且的確有上述幾種美得，在體育界他的確可有相當的貢獻；這次吾國參加世運，絕對應給給他一個機會；但不應該以十項運動的非法選他為代表。爲什麽不派他在考察團裏呢？</p>
<p>我們希望十六名選手應該嚴格的審查一下，至少要及格預選標準成績的纔有代表中國參加世運的資格。加入經費充裕的話，把所有離預選標準成績不遠，而符合選拔三原則的落伍選手，不妨另組織一個「觀光團」，隨同赴德觀光，也可以得些技術上和建設上的知識。或者把資格較深似乎已不能再繼續運動者如劉長春張齡佳郝春德等，不希望他們將來再繼續運動。理直氣爽地給他們一個「教練」的名義，給他們參予世運的機會，希望他們回國後老實的當指導員。</p>
<p>一味指責選拔的錯誤，不是聰明的辦法；為某一落選手張目伸冤，也並不光明；當局者的執迷不醒，不體與情，不謀良策，也不是全國體育最高機關和領袖們應有的態度；希望根據上述的第五點，謀一個無可如何的折衷辦法。（六月十二日夜）</p>

<p>粉市昨起意外反動、跌風之銳不亞於日前之飛漲、當時本月份尚有一度回好、繼因市上傳說進局已有緩和之證實、業內外人心均為安定、浮多首先了結、大戶亦有趁機售出、返崗機與浮散各客更為活動、良以前日之飛漲本屬被時局與人心所激起、並非有真正去路也、今時局旣平、大戶又為售出、高漲之局勢旣無所恃、市乃立即反跌矣、本月份一度跌進三元二角、遠期跌風尤比近月為甚、因有各方競出之故、本月份尚有大戶堅持、跌風較緩矣、但比之前日收價亦小去三分許、遠月小四五分云</p>

<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>—小朋友須具有一幹的精神—</p>
<p>在本刊上。有十幾個小朋友，發表過「我將來做怎樣的人？」這個重大的問題，的確目前亟需檢討的，尤其是一般小朋友，更應注意自已的切身問題，好為國家國家出力效勞。看了許多小朋友的志願，非常欣幸，有的要學科學的；有的要做大工程師；有的要做戰場上的看護；有的要辦教育業；這種種宏大的志願在。確是可以救國救民，造福無量。</p>
<p>我們現在的理想，就是將來實行的張本，事世紀末人人有的，成功卻很鮮見，這是什麼緣故？就是沒有實幹，苦幹，硬幹的精神。</p>
<p>譬如有一件事，呌甲去幹，但甲做這事，馬馬虎虎，精裏湖塗，不切實去幹，當然不會好，也不會成功。又呌乙去幹，起初很認真切實，但遇到了困難，吃不慣苦，於是中途拋棄，不去再幹了。又呌丙去幹，比較甲乙好得多了，都能打破這兩難關，但到將要成功的時候，被旁人說：「這件事絕對不會成功，去幹它做什麼？」丙就灰心不再幹下去。甲因為沒有腳踏實地去幹，乙因為沒有埋頭苦幹的精神，丙因為沒有堅強的意志，做事都沒成功。</p>
<p>小朋友！從前有許多人，都有這種志願，但成功的有幾個呢？我希望你們趕快養成起來，才可以達到你們自已的宏願</p>

<p>— 走肖</p>
<p>在江西省廬陵縣城裏有一位學宮祠，是專祭奉地方上偉大的人物的，像歐陽文忠公，楊忠襄公，胡忠簡公，周文忠公，又呌做四先生祠。</p>
<p>有一天，文天祥（這時年經還沒有十歲），走到那祠裏去遊玩，瞻仰一番，聽了人家說是幾們鄉賢，心中非常佩服！他就慨然的說：「我將來死後，不在這祠裏享受，和他們一樣的被大家崇拜，真不是大丈夫呀」小朋友們，你們想想看，他在那小小年紀，就有那樣大的志氣。自然不消說得他的父新，是非常愛他的，常言說得好：「知子莫若父」，又說「父望子成龍」，有了這個後輩，任誰都是喜歡的，何況他自已的父親呢。</p>
<p>果然，他後來長大後，替宋朝幹出一番紅轟轟烈烈火的事業，要想恢復漢族江山，竭力抵抗元兵，但結果不利，竟被捉著。元朝特別優待他，想他降服，元世祖也勸過他，並且還請他做宰相，可是他至死不屈。像他這樣擁護國家，像他這樣的愛國精神，——他不是忠於一姓的忠臣，他實在是擁護國家發揚　民族的志士。這種精神，是一個民族的起死還魂丹。總之：像他那樣的偉大人格，非但可泣可歌，並且還是小朋友們一個模範人物呢！</p>

<p>每天的早晨，敏兒總是獨自的到他家裏的花園中去呼　吸些新鮮空氣，園裏的樹木，已茂盛了，望出去，一片青蔥碧綠的色彩，真使人悅目，所以他是很愛樹木的，但他記得他哥哥會經說過，那些樹木是生物，它們一些兒不會動，怎麼可以呌它是生物呢？</p>
<p>「哥哥，你前向天不是說樹木是生物嗎？你怎麼知道的？」</p>
<p>「是的，樹木是生物，它為什麼是生物呢？那麼必須和非生物　的來比較一下，才能明白，不然是太沒有範圍了。生物和非生物的　區別很多：　構成生物的質料，是極小的細胞，小得連我們肉眼不能瞧，必須放在顯微鏡下放大後，才能看個明白。而非生物是沒有的。　生物時時的要吃食物，因為食物中含有能力，有了能力才能動，但是一部份的食物是被吸收了，所以一方面更需要　有別的食物來補充，　如果沒有食物來補充，　不是要餓死的嗎？你總沒有看見一塊石頭要吃食物，因為石頭是非生物，　是不需要的。　生物都能生長，像一棵樹能漸漸的長大，不過要非生物的冰，冰碎花瓶，怎麼會冰碎？因為水在結冰的時候，就要澎漲，但是這澎漲不是生長，只能增加體積而　不會生長的。　生物不但會生長，並且到了一定的時候，還能產生和它自已相　像的小生物，　非生物是不可能的。　外面如果一有了刺激，生物就應了這刺激發生種種的　運動，譬如你打了一雙狗，這打它一下的力，就是外面的刺激，你瞧，那物一定會很快的逃去　，這逃去就是一動運動。你想，非生物能這樣的嗎？　生物到了一定的時間，就要死亡，樹木要枯死，非生物就沒有死亡的現家象。這樣的一比較，就可以知道生物和非生物的不同點了。</p>

<p>近世的大電磁石有人千七百二十磅重，它的直徑是五尺二寸；它的工作是起重，起卸鐵質的東西。舉單平的鐵片可舉七萬磅。圖中是軍磁石起重機正裝一塊一塊的大鐵塊到貨車裏去的情況；平均每舉一次可裝四○○○磅！</p>

<p>— 章玉卿</p>
<p>小朋友！也許你們對於這個「最後一課」的名詞很生疏吧？現在我就把它　來作個槪括的說明。</p>
<p>「最後一課」本來是法國作家都德　所寫的一個短篇故事，故事的內容是講：一八七○年普法戰爭的時候，普軍侵入法境，一個法國小學校在敵人統治之下上著「最後一課」的情形。然而為什麼是「最後一課」呢？因為敵人　兇橫的到監後，不但土地是被割據了，連學校也被接收了，所以今天是法國自已的教師教書，明天是敵人的教師來教書了！今天教的是法文，明天教的是普魯士文了，今天的教師教小朋友　愛法國，明天的教師卻要教小孩子愛普國了，把侵略壓迫他們的敵人　認作慈祥仁愛的保護使者。教師很荘嚴地上完了這「最後一課」他心痛得流下了淚水來，學生們亦被激動得放聲大哭。小朋友，這是多麼地沉痛的　一個故事呵！</p>
<p>但是，現在為什麼把這故事搬到　中國來呢？這不消說，是因為國難日亟，敵軍長驅直入，於是有人借用了這「最後一課」的話，這是非常適宜的。</p>
<p>小朋友！不過，你們也不需要　因為一時給愛國的熱血衝湯了　而怨恨，慚愧，　甚至於自已小覷著自已。我為什麼要這樣的講呢？正因為我已經碰到了　好幾次小朋友，他們都像是很怨恨，慚愧，小覷自已的口吻對我講：「我衹怨恨自已牛得太幼小了，不能跟著大學生　中學生一同去幹救國工作，這豈不是枉為做了　中國人嗎？真把我羞死了！唉！小孩子太不中用了！」。可是，小朋友！你們是得明白的，救國並不是靠託一時的熱血的，是該要有堅持。中國的交來需要著你們來的主人翁哪！</p>

<p>近来我听到許多醫生們，在預測上海今年又是流行時疫的年頭。真的，回想到四年前的這人季節，上海會經發疫癘。當時死亡的人也不少，幸而撲滅有方，未致蔓延擴大。</p>
<p>小朋友！你們腦海裏還印著這一幕慘象沒有？你們覺得駭怕嗎？也許你們點點頭，會表示驚駭的。但是，僅是害怕有什麼用處？我們必須加以預防，以免「時令病」的侵入。下面所舉幾點，是我所要貢獻給你們的。</p>
<p>（一）要打防疫針　你們每個人都要懷著　未雨綢繆」的精神，及早請醫生注射防疫針，增進你對病魔的抵抗力，同進了可以減少你對於時疫流行的夏慮。</p>
<p>（二）住戶要整潔　上海的房金，的確高貴得可驚！大部份的人民，都不能得到寬大住屋。這也是都市特殊情形之一。居住高樓大廈的小朋友丟開不講，如果為了上面的情形，你們天天住在鴿籠式的房子裏，那未，房子雖然狹小，不十分緊要，只要空氣流通，掃除污積，調整器具，撲滅蚊蠅，諸事切實做到，也可以減少被病魔包圍的危機。</p>
<p>（三）飲食要謹慎　我們除了做到一二兩項之外，謹慎飲食，也要大加注意。諺云：「病從口入」，這話不鍇。如果飲食不講衛生，病魔就容易光顧。腐壞食品以及街頭小販之物，最好絕對不買。國為食物不乾淨，往往有細菌，在它上面不知道寄生著幾千幾萬，你們想罷，這是多麼危險呀！所以要生命安全，飲食一道，要謹於講究清潔的</p>
<p>小朋友！你們都是中國未來的主人翁，現在除掉充實你們的學業外，還要鍛練身體。夏天已降臨了，夏令衛生，先得注意直來！</p>
<h3 id="c192">地圓的證據 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 球</p>
<p>太陽從西方下去，慢慢地不見了：地面上由蒼黃而轉為昏黑。你以為全地球都被黑暗籠罩住了嗎？不是：地球的半面過著黑夜，和我們相反的半面去正在白晝呢。</p>
<p>太陽高高掛在空中，普照著萬方。地球是圓圓的，不住的在那裏轉動。向著太陽的一面便是晝；背著太陽的一面便是夜。</p>
<p>倘使你乘著飛行機上昇。離地面一萬英尺高，可以看到太陽比平地上遲十分鍾落山。</p>
<p>出太陽的情形也是如此。倘使你在日出之前，乘著飛機上昇到離地面兩英里的高度，你可以比平地上早十分鍾看到出太陽。</p>
<p>這個道理和登在高山頂上比平地上先見日出，後見日沒，是一樣的。這是一個明顯的地圓的證據。</p>
<p>地圓的證據，還可以用東西各地時間的不同來說明。在我們所住的東方，每天比我們的先見到太陽。例如東京的時間要比上海早一點多鍾；檀香山要比上海早兩點多鐘。在我們所住的西方，每天比我們後見太陽。例如成都的時間要比上海遲一點多鐘；新疆的伊寗要比上海遲兩點半鐘</p>

<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>全國兒童繪書書覧會，以過了四五個月的籌備，已於六月六日正式開幕。像這樣盛大的兒童書展會，在我國還是第一次，所以大會一切，值得為愛讀本刊的小朋友報告一下。發起這展會的是全國兒童年實施委員會、因為借上海市立體育場舉行，又委託上海市教育局等五團體負責籌備，他們費了很多的時間與精神，纔有這樣美滿的收穫，自然應當感激的。</p>
<p>我昨天到會場的時候，正有整千個兒童列隊參觀，大家覺得很高興，有一位小朋友對着老師說：「我們小孩子居然也會盡得這麼好而且把偌大的會場都佈置得像滿天星！一樣，啊小孩子的力量真是偉大呀。」一個穿綠衣衫的小孩說：「媽！我最愛看東北四省兒童的作品！可惜東四省暫時給人家侵奪去了，不何時纔能收復哩！」還有一位童子軍說：「爸！你不要以為美術不及科學，造房要打圖樣，造機器要打圖樣；造飛機大砲也要打圖樣，圖盡的用處正大呢。」、他們的話，我覺得都有道理。</p>
<p>大會出品是以省市為單位的，共計二十八單位，數量達三萬餘件，雖邊遠省區，均有出品，審查入遠的三分之一，其中分毛筆，鉛筆，粉筆，水彩，木炭，圖案等八組。還有一百六十餘兒童，對客揮毫，畫得十分出神。有幾們是察哈爾來的，其精神真使人佩服。這次參加人數，上海市最多，有一千餘人，浙江一千五百人。出品臘筆最多，佔百分之四十二，水彩次之，粉筆最少。題材風景最多，佔百分之四十，人物次之，動物最少。年齡十四歲至十歲的自由表面之作，最為有趣，高級生很多發揮民族思想，頗有愛國精神，但有些成人授意或潤飾，未免失去純真的創作性了。</p>

<h3 id="c197">評劉王立明女士的「生命的波濤」 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 瑚</p>
<p>——圓明園路二〇五號中國女子生產合作社發行，每冊定價一元二角——</p>
<p>「生命的波濤」是最近才出版的一部長篇小說，它的作者是我們所熟知的劉王立明女士。在這小說的對面上就有這樣的詩句映在我們眼裏——</p>
<p>「前進！生命的小舟，前進！</p>
<p>不要怕大海中的波濤，</p>
<p>不要怕江河裏的駭浪，</p>
<p>古今來，惟有大公無私，</p>
<p>忠，勇，耐勞者勝利——</p>
<p>這就是造物的定律，</p>
<p>這也就是我們的人生。」</p>
<p>這樣的詩句，從表面上一看好像是很前進的，但仔細吟味起來，卻是非常空洞，一點實在的內容也沒有的。因此，它的意義也就沒有一定了：你要把它用來表現眞正前進的思想也可以，你要說它是後退者的好聽的歌詞也未嘗要不得；所謂「忠」，「勇」，「耐勞，所謂「大公無私，」」這些字眼並不是絕對有前進意義的，它們的意義必要由它們的具體內容來判定。假使這樣的詩句可以表現「生命的波濤」的全部內容的話，那在實際上它的具體內容便不一定是前進的；就中的「前進」，「忠」，「勇」等詞句只不過是些好看的裝飾罷了。</p>
<p>先就這小說的題材來說，就是極平凡的青年男女的戀愛生活。雖然在故事的構成和發蔚縣過程中，作者曾提出了許多現實的重大問題，但那並未被當作重要的題材來描寫，當然更未有正確的表現；而是附帶提出並且歪曲地表現了的。自然，文學作品的評價不能單單依據題材，但題材與作品的價值卻是大有關係。如果作品的價值必要以其感人的力量來決定，那麽，藝術地描寫了與最多數人有深切關係的那典型的社會現象的作品，便應該是最有價值的，因爲這才能得到多數人深切的共鳴；至於個人的身邊瑣事，特殊生活，那除個人自身有興味外，對於多數和他生活不同的人是不能發生共感的。「生命的波濤」雖然產生在目前中國這動亂的時代中，但它並不是這時代的典型的社會現象的描寫；它所表現的只是一個反抗舊家庭包辦婚姻的女子的遭遇，特別是她的特殊的戀愛生活：這是「五四」以後的時髦題材；但因爲「五四」時代早已過云，所以這樣的題材在目前已經是喪失前進的意義了。</p>
<p>再看這小說的思想內容。作者首先表現出的，是對於封建家長包辦婚姻這種制度的抗議。她告訴我們：有一個名叫黃慕雲的女郎，因反抗家長包辦婚姻，從家中逃了出來，同時，與他訂婚的青年男子仁邦也因不滿意家長包辦婚事而離家了；後來經過了許多波折，他們竟巧錄用地幣自由戀愛而結成了夫婦。這樣，雖然這對青年男女，曾同時反抗過家長包辦婚事的，終於結合了起來，但在形式上總是經過了一番對於封建家庭的反抗的。這種思想不消說也是「五四」時代的思想，說來是早已過云的了；但作者就是對於這樣的「五四」時代的反封建思想也表現得不大澈底：她用來代替舊的封建思想的並不是這思想的對立物，而是另一形態的賢良主義。她努力讚揚了主人翁黃慕雲在結婚後對於丈夫的順從。在她的筆下，當慕雲發現了丈夫仁邦另有所愛，覺得那樣的家庭生活無味時，雖然也離開家庭，但這卻不是「娜拉的出走」，也不是對於那醜惡的家庭生活的澈底反抗，而是藉以促使對已情感不忠實的丈夫的悔悟；事實的表現是在慕雲離家後，雖然丈夫已一浪漫女子同居，雖然此時她也有她很心愛的另一男子向她要求，但她依然對已婚的丈夫絕對忠實，結果是丈夫果然悔悟，把她接回家庭。像這樣的「忠」，「勇」的精神，像這樣的「從一而終」的思想，像這樣的對男子的順從，像這樣的賢良主義，你說能比完全服從家長包辦婚姻者進步多少？但這正是這小說的主題，正是作者的中心思想；小說中的黃慕雲女士也正是作者的化身。</p>
<p>「生命的波濤」是「×××」到「×××」時代產生的，作者在這中間也表現了這兩大事變的情形。但她對於由這兩大事變所引起的羣衆中的爭論，紀初是抱著諷刺的態度完全否定，隨即便公然表現出了她所讚美的那對青年男女仁邦和慕雲是「右派」，主張「用心讀書，努力自強」。依所過去和現在的情形，這主張是否對，讀者當然知道，我們也無須多說。不過單就這一點看來，也可知道作者在當前的民族解放運動中所站的立塲是怎樣的了。</p>
<p>在這小說中，作者也表現了勤勞者的痛苦，社會的許多黑暗面，但這並不是要引起大家的反抗，以自己的力量去謀解放，而是爲的宣傳基督敎義，爲的要人去信仰上帝，去進博愛，爲的勸人捐欵去辦宗敎的慈善事業。作者所描畫的主人公黃慕雲便是一位基督敎徒，她熱心慈善事業，有「爲主義犧牲」的精神，對於上帝她是信仰到了極點。只要是有什麽災難苦痛來臨時，「果然的，人天感應，風浪平息，而太陽的光輝也慢慢地從雲兒裏射出來了。」看了這小說，使我們不禁想起了托爾斯泰，這位偉大的天才作家便是盡量地暴露了當時俄國社會的僞善黑暗的，但他也同樣叫大家去相信上帝，以阻止在家的澈底反抗，維護當時封建貴族的地位，因此傷害了他的許多偉大作品的價值。「生命的波濤」在表現社會的黑暗面而同時又宣傳基督敎義一點上，應該給與同樣的評判。當然，我並不是說「生命的波濤」的作者可以與托爾斯泰相比；我所說的意思是在於基督敎徒暴露社會黑暗的用意。</p>
<p>至於這小說的藝術的表現力，那也是很低下的。對於事件的發展，人物的表情，作者都只是抽象地敘述，說不上具體地描畫。但文學作品的主要特點便是在於具體地生動地藝術地表現。如要表現一件事情很嚴重，或一種形勢是很緊張，或某人很苦痛，這些都不能以某此抽象的詞句或某些簡單的事實之羅列來表現，而必要深入到事件的核心和人物的心底，從各方面具體地生動地描畫的。一個作品所描寫的事件和人物，必要使人看了如像眞的事件，活的人物出現在眼前一樣，那才是好的，不然就是劣品；而「生命的波濤」在藝術的表現方面便是屬於後者的。隨便舉個例來說，如慕雲被禁在家中，祖父因她反抗婚姻要將她活埋，母親被迫氣死了，這一段的情景，這一段中的各個塲面，應該是如何的緊張，但在作者的筆下，除了慕雲的簡單的哭以外，許多必要的情景，如祖父橫暴的姿態，善良的母親內心的矛盾，慕雲痛苦憤怒的心理和表情，家人親戚等在這一事件中錯綜的關係，都未能具現出來；因此，在這段事實中，沒有使人興奮，緊張，悲痛，憤怒的頂點或高潮，沒有活的塲面，也沒有活的人物：所有的只是平板地告白和敘述。——這便是作者藝術表現力的不足之處。</p>
<p>因爲作者藝術表現力的低下，所以這作品的結構也不嚴密，許多事件的處理和配置都不適當。我以爲在這中間有許多無關緊要的事就當略去，以便集中精力描寫那些重要的塲面。但作者卻把所有瑣碎的事都羅列出來；有時甚至故意企圖使事件發生曲折，引出許多不必要的事來，所以結果反使人感到這小說只是些事實的堆積和羅列，而且這堆積和羅列又很散漫，幾乎完全沒有藝術的意味。至於典型人物的描畫，那更是說不上生動和深刻。慕雲和仁邦以及所有全小說中的人物都沒有個性，看來都不是活人；我們看了這小說後，對於中間的人物的一切表情，對於他們談話，做事的姿態，他們的內心和外表，他們的個性中的主要特點，都不能發生活的印象。我想，就是作者，恐怕也不能具體告訴我們慕雲和仁邦這些人物的性格如何吧。</p>
<p>不過，作者個人是怎樣的思想，好怕　做人態度如何，她所希望的是些什麽，在這作品中倒是可以看出的（已經說過，主人公黃慕雲便是作者自己；至於演男角的是誰，我們還不知道），雖然這中間有她自己的辯護和過分的誇張。</p>

<p>人口問題，說來也是很複雜的一個問題。但在市民的學者裏，被尊泰爲人品問題理論的泰斗的學者，就是馬爾薩斯。在十七八世紀的歐洲，因爲近代的民族國家的勃興，商業資本主義的特殊發達，富國強兵，海外殖民地的掠取，成爲各國最普遍的要求，所以那時各國都競相以獎勵人口增加爲政策，這完全是爲了要建立強大的軍隊，爲了要旅行移民，甚至爲了能夠增加人口以提高消費量擴充國內市場的要求所引起的。但是，同時在十八世紀中，工業</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>資本主義也很快地發達起來了，於是因爲它的集中和毀滅的作用，漸漸在下層社會造成了廣大的貧苦的無產者層，甚至逐漸表現出勞力過剩，經常地發現了產業上的失業的後備軍。於是人口的增加成爲資本主義所不能消化的勞力鼓脹現象，即連過去爲了能够彌補人口增加政策的缺陷而提倡的救貧法等等，亦仍然成爲無益而有害的政策了。所以拋棄增加人口的政策，遂不能不成爲資本士議生產的新的企圖，而馬爾薩斯的人口論也就在這種企圖上發生了。他的人口問題理論是在十九世紀的開始就公表出來了的，而其理論的中心則在反對人口增加的政策，主張節制生育便是顯著的證明。</p>
<p>照馬爾薩斯人口論的要點來說，第一，他認爲若照人類的自然生殖率說來，它是按幾何如1:2;2:4;4:8;8:16;16:32那樣的增加。可是食物的增加，即使人類生產能力是前進的，然其前進的比率也只能照算學級數而增加，即照1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8那樣的等差級數而增加。所以若以食物增加的比率與人口增加的比率相較，前者始終是趕不上後者的。第二，可是爲甚麽人類已經歷這樣多年的歷史，地球上還未至有人滿之患呢？在他看來這是由於當食物與人口增加稍一發生不平衡時，在生產與消費間，需要與供給間　失調和，於是人類自巳中間就發生了生存競爭，弱肉强食，優勝劣敗的現象，而饑荒，戰爭，殺老棄幼等等即行其抑壓的限制，過多的人口仲被淘汰下去，甚至由於貧困等等而行防禦的限制，不能使人口照它的自然增殖率增加。第三，因爲人口增加比食物增加快，　因爲社會的一切貧困和罪惡都發生於此，所以如救貧法的設施和增加工資等等實足助長人口堵加和社會的罪惡的發生，因此要救濟社會的病態就只有實行早婚的矯正和生育上的節制，才是正當而可能的辦法。</p>
<p>馬爾薩斯的人口論，它不但是表明資本主義的生產，以它的機器的生產代替了勞力，以它的集中和毀滅小生產的作用造成了社會的貧困和失業現象，由不能消化過剩的勞力而企圖抑制人口的增加，如我們前面巳經提說過的那梯，而且它還有一種掩飾這一生產制度的矛盾的作用。因爲資本士義社會的戰爭，窮困，和一部分人過度的勞動與另一部分人的失業至於無事可作，乃至營養不足等罪惡現象，完全是它自己本身的矛盾所造成的。然而馬爾薩斯就把這原因歸之於人口增加與食物增加的平衡，，以此發生生存競爭的結果，這完全是想在這理論掩蔽之下，使大家看不見資本主義生產的缺陷，而轉移　目標去對着人類生殖的自然法則，在那裹去想救濟的方法，這是多麼巧妙和便宜的事呢？</p>
<p>在馬爾薩斯的人口問題的理論中，有許多根本上的錯誤點，這是我們所必須指出的。首先就是他所謂人口照幾何級數增加，而食物則照算學級數增加，食物增加趕不上人口增加的理論，是不完全正確的。自然，如果照人口增加之純自然法則說，的確應該是很快的，但是，人類不如一般的生物單純地受自然法則支配，所以就在生殖方面也同樣要受社會法則支配。生產力的發展，社會的生產關係和他的制度等等，都是具體地支配着人口的增减和人類生殖的。比如在生產幼穉的原始民族中，因爲養不活多的人口，而殺老　幼的事實便普遍地存在。在宗法的和對建的社會裏，在宗法制度與農業經濟的生產形態下，由於大家庭的繁榮與農耕上廣大勞力的需要，和兩性的終身聚處而永無分離等等，　發生了多子多孫的要求而影響於人口增殖。但在資本主義社會裏的下　羣衆，却因爲貧困無力婚嫁，以及十家庭的破壊和兩性各　謀生的必須而常常分離等等，都足以影響人口生殖率的低降。所以除非因爲天災，戰禍等等而大量的毀滅過去農業經濟社會中的人口，和近代的資本主義國家因特種關係而獎勵生殖，如意大利之所爲那樣外，在下層社會一般的生殖率上，資本社會之生產率是比過去農　經濟社會的生產率低些的。這裏我只　大戰前後的幾個例子來說，即可證明。一九○八年的人口生產率，在日本爲三三·七；美國爲二六·六；挪威二六·二；瑞典二五·七；丹麥二八·六；荷蘭二九·七；比國二四·九；法國二○·一；意大利三三·七；德國三二·○；可是到一九一八年呢，日本則爲三二·二；英國爲一七·五；挪威為二五·八；瑞典二○·一；丹麥二四·二；荷蘭二五·三；比國九·五；法國一○·○；意大利在一九一七年是一九·○；德國在一九一四年是二六·五。由這些簡單的數字所吿訴我們的，就可以證明資本主義社會愈往下發展，人口生殖率便愈趨於低降。歐洲各國乃至日本，沒有一個國家其人口生殖率在一九八年不比一九○八年低些。這中間難然經過歐戰，但這與戰爭死亡人口無大關係，因爲這是就活着的人每千人生產率來說的。由此可知人口增加之生產率並不能依照生物學的自然法則去說明，它是被社會法則所支配的，它是依照生產力，生產關係的變化法則而表現其進退的。固然，馬爾薩斯也說到由於食物的經濟的生產力的限制而限制了人口的增加，但是他始終是把人口生殖之自然法則作爲主題看的。其實那不過是一個抽象的槪念，並不是人口變動的具體法則。只有依於生產力和生產關係之變化去說明人口變化，纔是具體的眞能適用的法則，馬爾薩斯的法則是無用的抽象的法則，不是人類生殖的眞實法則。</p>
<p>至於食物的增加是不是趕不上人口的增加呢？在這裏馬爾薩斯仍然是陷於抽象的對比的錯誤泥坑中了。第一，在食物增加的本身，它並不是永遠限於不變的算學級數的。在生產力愈向前進中，它的增加率是愈大的，甚至可能地由算學級數躍進於幾何級數的增加。假使你把近代農工業生產的邁進的情形一看，就知道使用和從前回樣的勞力和同樣的土地來生產，現在　能獲得不知高出若干倍的生產品那件事實。第二，即以人口增加和食物增加的對比說，現在一個人的勞力的生產效能，因爲得着科一學與技術的帮助，不知超過了他個人所能消費的數量若干倍。就是說比他的生產能力他的生殖率是高出了若干倍的，因爲以他生產能力所能養活的入數說，絕不是他的生殖能力所能趕得上的。現在一個工人的生產品可以養活幾十幾百人，但他的生殖率有這樣大嗎，事實上是反比從　低了，如果以他的生產而全部來養活他的子女，是消費不完的，還不要說他的子女又要繼續生產。惜乎在現社會他的剩餘生產反轉了資本主去增殖資本和養活許多寄生者，因而他自己和一般勤勞者仍處於窮困之中，但這絕不是他們的生產量不够養活他們。</p>
<p>其次是馬爾薩斯由於那一根本　提的錯誤，遂把人口之無益的損耗　之於食物不足的生存競爭所引起的戰爭，窮困，待遇惡劣等等，把一切社會的罪惡歸之於食物不足，把人口的損耗認爲是生存競爭之優勝劣敗的自然法則，這老實說，他這理論完全只是在掩蔽社會制度的罪惡。因爲一切戰爭與窮困的根源，到現在人人都能明瞭它是資本主義生產關係上的矛盾，並不是由於食物不足，也不是甚麼人類天生成的生存競爭法則所支配的。如果說這是食物不足的必然結果，那麼現在的牛奶，咖啡大王把這些東西向海裏傾倒，把麥子存在倉庫裏聽？如果說這是生存競爭，那麼是不是沒有這種戰爭和資本的剝削壓迫，人類就不能生存呢？而且現今的勤勞大衆又是不是天然地都是些劣種，所以才天然地應當被處罰於貧因，不能婚嫁生育，營養不足，過度勞動等等，以損耗其生命和傳種的權利而歸於淘汰呢？其實現社會的文明都楚勤勞大衆所創造的，以他們的成績來說，他們才正是適於生存的優者，不應當是被生存競爭所淘汰的劣者。所以把一切社會罪惡歸之於食物不足所引起的生存競爭，把勤勞大衆在人口的損耗上看做是生存競爭中被淘汰的劣者，完全是不正確的。這些罪惡應該由社會制度本身來負，是現有生產關係的結果。</p>
<p>旣然社會的貧困，戰爭和一切罪惡，並不是由於人口增加過速，食物增加過緩，而是由於社會的生產關係的結果，那麼根本地來解决這一問題，也不是馬爾薩斯所提出的甚麼限制早婚和生育等等所能奏效的（雖然早婚應當限制），而是應就社會關係本身來加以改造。現在的許多生育節制論者，他們大概也就是以馬爾瞌斯的理論和解决貧困的方法爲根據罷，道我們是絲毫不敢贊同的。</p>

<h3 id="c199">蘇聯外長李維諾夫 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 南</p>
<p>只要是留心國際局勢的人，差不多誰都知道赤色外交家李維諾夫的大名。他是近年來蘇聯和平外交主要的執行者；假使我們不吾認近年來蘇聯和平外交的成功時，那這成功的代表的實踐人物便可說是李維諾夫。</p>
<p>李維諾夫的狀貌頗似大商人，他的臉是肥圓的，腹部突出，走路當然也不很敏捷，那樣兒眞有點像大腹賈。的確，說也奇怪，這位赤色外交家原來的家庭就非赤貧的，他的父親也可算是一時的富豪，而他自己在少年讀書時代也曾立志耍做個大實業家。但後來他受了時代思潮的影響，竟獻身於革命了。因此，在一九一○年他被沙皇政府所逮捕，充軍到了荒凉的西伯利亞；在那里使他第一次嘗到了革命的苦味，同時也更堅决了他的信心。</p>
<p>在俄國的革命運動中，李維諾夫的主耍供獻之一，可以舉出他在經濟方面的帮助。他曾做過書賈，當過建築師的打樣員，作過跑碼頭的販賣商人：那時他做在　的天才可說和他現在辦外交的天才一樣，他能用許多方法獲得勝利，達到賺錢的目的。但他賺來的錢却並不放進自己的腰包，而是拿去資助革命的。現在一般所知道的，是高爾基曾在經濟上資助過當時的俄國革命，却不曉得李維諾夫對過去俄國革命也曾有過大的經濟帮助。這在現刻假如要「論功行賞」的話，那外交家李維諾夫與文學家高爾基是當相提並論的吧。</p>
<p>一九一八年俄國革命成功，那時李維諾夫正在倫敦，莫斯科卽去電任他爲駐英大使。這個消息傳到後，英國人知道了一個曾做過跑碼頭的小販當了大使，其驚異情形是可想見的。但這只不過是李維諾夫在外交界活動的開始，他的驚人表現還在後面呢。</p>
<p>李維諾夫之出現於國際外交舞台，演了重要角色的，是在一九二九年十一月的第四次世界軍縮會議席上。事實是：當着列强正在會議中爭論不休的時候，李維諾夫卽代表蘇聯投下了一顆驚人的炸彈，他提議立刻實行一　的軍縮，完全廢除陸海空軍。這一個驚人的議案雖遭吾决，但從此新外交家李維諾夫之名便爲列强所深切注意了。待到一九三○年時，他更正式地作了蘇聯的外交委員長，常常往來於倫敦巴黎日內瓦等重要都市之間，努力於蘇聯的和平外交活動。</p>
<p>作了正式的外交委員長之後，在一九三一和三二年間，李維諾夫本着蘇聯的和平政策，與波蘭·芬蘭·拉特維亞·愛沙尼亞·立陶宛等鄰近諸國訂立了互不侵犯條的，在蘇聯的四周築好了安全的防綫。接着在一九三三年的倫敦世界經濟會議中，他更施展他的外交手腕，看定列强的內在恐慌和相互矛盾，常塲擊破了德國的進攻，並與十耳共阿富汗等國訂立多邊公的，獲得了西班牙的承認蘇聯，以及英美法等國之親俄。</p>
<p>人們說一九三三到三四年是李維諾夫的外交年，這的確不是誇張的說法。在這時期中，這位新的外交家幾乎每天都在外交的旅途中忙碌着，在蘇聯外交史上留下了許多重要的記載。就中値得特別提出的　　　　　　　　　善。前者在自前看來，對於國際局勢雖無决定作用，但對遠東形勢之發展和變化却是多少有些關係的。至於後者，那可說是最近歐洲乃至世界形勢轉化的一個關鍵。我們知道，在希特勒未上台前，蘇聯是與德國接近抗禦法國的，而法國在那時却是反蘇聯戰綫的組織者；反之，自希特勒上台後，不僅德俄關係惡化，同時德法矛盾也更行尖銳了，於是便促成了法蘇接近；而李維諾夫便是使法蘇接近的媒介人之一。由於法蘇親善關係的發展，使歐洲乃至世界形勢發生了極大的變化。我們單看最近法國內部對於法蘇恊定的爭論，以及希特勒之藉口法國會批准這恊定而撕毀諾加羅公的，進兵萊茵河，便可想見法蘇親近與歐洲和世界局勢之關係了。</p>
<p>當蘇聯被邀請加入國際聯盟時，李維諾夫一面表明了他是世界的一個新國家的代表，同時一面又明言了蘇聯的和平主義。這是因爲蘇聯存在於現實的資本主義社會中，尙須與各資本主義國家發生必要的關係，而不能完全離開這世界的國家關係之外。本此原則，蘇聯一面努力於內部的建設，一面又利用了資本主義國家間的矛盾來保障自身的安全：而李維諾夫便是這安全保障的和平外交的執行者。現在，國際形勢日益緊張，他的外交工作當然也隨着更行緊張了。他現刻已是六十歲以上的老年，但他在外交工作中仍保持着靑年的積極精神，他正在爲蘇聯的安全和世界的眞正和平而奮鬥。</p>

<h3 id="c200">怎樣研究國際政治？ <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 利生</p>
<p>你旣然生活在現實世界中，便不能不注意這世界的政治形勢。因爲不管你是否願意，國際政治的變化都必然要對你的國家發生影響，因而也必然嬰影響到你的生活。比如說由英日美在太平洋上爭奪市場的政治鬥爭所導引出來的它們的貨幣戰爭，便直接地影響到了中國貨幣政策，因而也就影響到了全中國人的生活。又如，離我們較遠的歐州政治的動態也與我們有很大的關係；事實上　由德法俄的衝突所發展出來的日德親近那樣的政治事件，便直接關係到中國人民的解放。至於世界大戰的爆發，遠東局勢的變化，那更是要强烈地影響到每一個人的生活。因此，假使你不願糊裏糊塗地牛活着，處在這世界危機正發展的時期，便當切實注意國內外政治情勢之變化，以决定你的生活態度；所謂「休談時事」的格言，除了自甘愚味的糊塗蟲外，是不會爲一個活人所接受的。</p>
<p>那麽，怎麽硏究國際政治呢？現在我們就要來向你談這個問題。</p>
<p>首先你應該知道經濟是社會的基礎，一定一的政治形態或政治變化都是由一定的經濟基礎發生的；我們可以說國際政治之發展變化是隨着國際經濟之發展變化而行的。這就大的方面說，如目前國際政治關係所表現出的戰爭危機，’便是由世界經濟發展的危機所導引出來的。因爲在世界經濟的發展中，各資本主義國家都發生了生產過剩，無法銷售的矛盾現象，在這矛盾現象之下，它們不得不拚命爭奪市塲，於是，殖民地再分割的問題，爭奪市塲的戰爭，使日益現實化了。又就部分的國際政治動態來說，如意大利的侵略阿比西尼亞，很顯然地也是由意國內部經濟危機發展出夾的；我們必須要了解意國的原料缺芝，人口過多，國民窮化，失業恐慌，貿易萎縮，以及財政危機等現象，才能明白慕索里尼向東菲冒險的侵略行爲。再就各個國家的對外政策來說，那更是必要由它的經濟情形來說明？這裏我們可以舉出一個顯明的例證來，如意大利德國以及它們在東方的同道者的向外侵略，往往是以武力爲先鋒，以軍事政治的侵略扶助和發展經濟的侵略，但美國却是「和平」地進行着經濟侵略，不先作軍事的冒險，這是什麼原因呢？它們不同是帝國主義者嗎？何以它們的侵略字段不同呢？這就是因爲　　　　的</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>上不能和別的帝國主義行「和平」的競爭，所以才不得不行軍事的冒險；而美國則由於它的金元力量太大，可以統制北美，可以攻入其他帝國主義者的殖民地或獨覇的市場，用不着先行軍事的爭奪。依據這些，我們當可想到：要是不明白世界經濟的形勢，各國經濟的概况，那是不能理解錯綜複雜的國際政治關係和各國政治動態的。</p>
<p>其次，你便應該注意國際條約的歷史和內容，特別是上次大戰以後所產生的那些重要的國際條約；如凡爾賽和約，非戰公約，諾加羅條約等等。因爲條約雖不能絕對拘束列强的行動，但一般說來，對於各條約國的內政外交總有密切的關孫；而且，我們甚至可以說，國際關係之形式的構成便是以國際條約爲綫索的。因此，國際間每一新的事件發生，都會引起各國興論對於某某條約的評價和討論。我們不是常常在報上看到某國指摘某國違反什麽條約精神的新聞嗎？那便可說是國際政治的具體的條文的鬥爭。更具體地說，如過去德國的重整軍備，法人即認爲是違反了凡爾　條約；最近德國的廢除諾加羅條約，淮兵萊茵河，史引起了國際信義的鬥爭，不僅是表面的條約問題，而且是在根本上的德法兩國政治的利害衛突尖銳化的表現。因爲凡爾賽和約與諾加雜公約都是法國用以保障其在上次大戰中的勝利品並控制歐洲的工具，所以它非保持這兩個條約不可；反之在德國看來，這兩個條約却是束縛德國發展的，所以它隨時都在設法解除。這樣，在凡爾賽和約與諾加羅條約中，德法便發生了不可調和的政洽爾突。由此看來，如果我們研究國際政治而不知道國際問題重要條約的歷史和內容，那便不僅無法將錯綜複雜的國際關係理出一個頭緒來，恐怕連每天新聞紙上所載的什麼條約的字樣都會不理解，在實際上成爲　報都看不懂的盲人。</p>
<p>再就橫的方面說，世界的地理形勢也是研究國際政治者所當注意的。因爲世界各國的國防和其向外發展的途徑都與它們的地理形勢有直接的關係，所以某些重要地方往往成用列强鬥爭的目的，成爲國際政治問題的中心。如地中海問題，多瑙河流城問題，巴爾韓問題，米美爾問題，太平洋問題等等，都是目前國際上　　　的問題、　便我們不明白世界　　　　的形　，不知道世界上各重要地方的方位及其在政治上，經濟上或軍事上的作用，那也是不能理解國際政治的動態的。舉一個最近的事例來說吧，如意大利用暴力侵佔阿比西尼亞問題，這雖是由意國必然要向外侵略的內在原因產生的，但這兒的問題是意國何以不向巴爾幹或別的地方進兵，而一定要遠征東菲呢？這原因是巴爾幹或別的地方的形勢太複雜，英法等國在那裏都有强大的勢力，使慕索里尼不敢向那些地方妄動；至於阿比西尼亞，雖然與英法等國也有深切的利害關係，但它們在那要的直接的力量並不大；而且阿國與意領耶里特里和索謀里蘭相連接，侵呑阿國可以使意國在菲洲的殖民地連成一片；所以慕索里尼才選擇了這個不致遭到極强烈抗禦的弱國——阿比西尼亞做他向外侵略的對象。我們的這段解說雖不能完全用來說明意國侵阿與地理形勢的關係，但在這中間却可以明白看出這問題在地理形勢上確有很大的關係。因此，假使你不明白意大利在歐洲在世界上所處的地位，不知道阿比西尼亞的地勢，那也是不能理解問題之全部的。</p>
<p>還有，現今地球上六分之五的國家都有許多階層，在這些階層中甚至還有許多集團，它們各自都有政黨和政治上的代言人，常常站在它們的立塲上發表乃至實施某種政治主張；因此，一個國家的內閣的更動，行政人員的交替，便會　　它內政外交的　動：這不　興它本國政治　直接關係，而且對世界形　都有或大或小的影響。比如，在希特勒未上合以前的德國，德蘇邦交是很好的，而法蘇關係却在惡化中，但希特勒上台以後，因他所代表的人羣和所行的政策不同，便使德蘇關係惡化，德法矛盾更尖銳了，同時更促成了法蘇的親近，使歐洲形勢爲之一變。又如最近法國大選的結果，左派人民陳綫大獲勝利，社會黨起而組閣，這也必然要給與歐洲形勢以極大的影響。因之，我們研究國際政治，必要知道世界各主要國家的政黨和政治家所代表的是什麽人羣及其政見如何；否則，不僅不能明白國際政治上所發生的某些變化，看出國際形勢的動向，而且對於各主要國家的政治變化也是莫明其妙的。</p>
<p>此外，硏究國際政治當然須要實際「硏究」，須要常看書報；而且，研究起來還要特別用心，不能馬虎。如報紙上的國際新聞，有些人便是走馬看花，只看一個題目了事；殊不知政治新聞的全部內容並不能在幾個字的題目上顯示出來，有時候某些新聞的眞情甚至不能在記載它的表面字句中可以看得出，那是必要細心硏究，理解其「弦外之音」才能明白其究竟的。於必要時，甚至可以多訂幾份報紙和雜誌來看；我以爲在目前的中國，如「申報」，「申報週刊」，「大公報」，「時事新報」，「大美晚報」，「世界知識」等，硏究國際政治者都有經常訂閱的必要。</p>

<h3 id="c201">怎樣僱用女僕 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 倫衍</p>
<p>僱用女僕，說來也不是一件容易的事。輟耕錄中說得好：「婢僕初來時曰播盤珠，言不撥自動，稍久曰算盤珠，言撥之則動，旣久曰佛頂珠，言終日凝然，雖撥之亦不動。」這很可替女僕寫照。那末怎麽可以使女僕始終如一的做擂盤珠，而不撥自動呢？且聽我道來。</p>
<p>在到薦頭店喚娘姨之前，第一，自己先要决定，喜歡用什麽地方人。譬如喜歡蘇州娘姨，那末到「姑蘇薦頭店」去，喜歡壯健的安徽娘姨，就要到「金陵薦頭店」去。不然你總喚不到滿意的娘姨的。第二，要明瞭自己家裏的情形，用多大年紀的女僕才適當。譬如自己家裏是住在三層樓，有小孩子在學校念書，午飯時要送飯的，或是信札來往很多，時常要到郵局送信去的，那末必定要用一個二十二三歲以上三十五歲以下的壯健女僕，不然就不能勝任愉快了。</p>
<p>自己决定主意後，就可到薦頭店去挑選了。這時候可細細的觀察，那一個衣服最整潔—不是華麗—，態度最端壯，舉止最安詳，身體最强壯，那一個就當選。因爲連自己衣服都弄不淸楚的，做事情也不會乾凈，態度輕浮，舉止魯莽的，容易多惹是非，身體不强壯的，根本就不能做事。爲避免將來糾紛計，最初一定耍股格些。</p>
<p>女僕選定了，先要試做三天，在這三天內是女僕最賣力的時期，卽所謂「擂盤珠」也。可是因爲「新來慢到，不知道缸碗鍋灶」，所以主婦一定要詳細的把每天應做的事吿訴她。但得隨機應變。譬如女僕來時是卑晨九時，這正是揀洗小菜，預備午膳的時侯，就要吿訴她小菜如何分配，米該量幾升等。若是下午二三點鐘來—那很少的，大半是上午來的—，就呌她漿洗衣服和燒晚飯等事。臨睡前該吿訴她明天幾點鐘起身，起身後先生煤爐燒稀飯，再收拾客堂等事，使她不致於起身後無從措手。</p>
<p>三天做滿，主僕雙方認爲滿意，就要「稱工錢」了。工錢稱定後，最少要做一個月，無論那一方都不能「解的」，不然要賠償損失的，—主方主動的，由主方多付一月工錢，僕方主動的則扣除一月工錢</p>
<p>在最初一月內，主婦應特別的小心處理家政，和留心女僕的一切舉動。因爲量初一月內是主婦測騐女僕最好的時期，若主婦處理家政井井有條，那女僕知道主婦是很精明的，就不敢作弊了。「人心不同，各如其面」，在短短三天的試做時期，怎能知道這個女僕是忠厚或是狡猾的呢？所以主婦應隨時隨地加以測騐，—注意別給女僕知道你要測騐她。譬如要知道女僕是吾要偷竊或貪小利，你可假意把銅元遺忘在桌子上，自已暗暗記住有多少銅元。隔一天或半天獨自去看桌子上的銅元是不是還存在，或是短少幾個。若是原封不動，這個女僕是誠實的，若是不在了或短少幾個，就可知道這女僕是不誠實的。</p>
<p>做了一個月後，倘然這女僕確實是忠誠勤儉，可以繼續做下去的，那末你可以把防範比較放鬆些，不必時時留意，嚴加監督，在可能範圍內還可將一部份工作全權託付她，譬如買菜燒菜煮飯等，全呌她做，她一定做得井井有條，也不會有揩油，以少報多的事發生。因爲人們有一種自尊心，若得到了他人的信仰，自尊心滿足了，一定赤膽忠心的幹事，允其是頭腦簡單的她們。多年老僕，對於主人的恭敬衛誰出力，以及不惜犧牲個人，爲主人效努的，不是很多嗎？</p>
<p>主婦對待女僕的態度應和靄而莊嚴，使她感覺到你這人又可親又可畏。說話不要太帶命令式，要在命令式中滲些普通對話的意味，因爲命令式十足的說話，在聽者會發生不快的感覺，而做事就勉强了。</p>
<p>一個人難免有錯的地方，當女僕把事情做錯了，我們該如何辦理呢？我以爲最好不要叱駡她，甚至毆打她。我們先耍問明做錯的原因，若是出於無意的，那末就不必責駡她，只要好好的可嚀她以後當心些就是了。</p>
<p>對待女僕不可太苛刻。不要擺出主人的架子，把主僕的界限分得太嚴，把她當做奴隸看待。飯應該隨她飯量吃，小菜不可太菲薄。也不要任意呼叱差遣她。每天應該讓她有休息的時間，當她做完了應做的事情後。每天應該讓她有充足的睡眠，如無特殊情形，不要使她睡得太遲。她每天應有一小部份的時間，給她自己做私事——如裁製自己和兒女丈夫的衣服，替兒女做鞋子，或出外探視親友等。</p>
<p>傭人不要時常掉換，因爲時常掉換新人，不但浪費金錢——薦頭錢，而且精神上也要蒙很大的損失。當一個新的女僕進來時，你要費去多少的精力心血去訓練她，試騐她。若做了一二個月就掉換了，這些精力心血不是白費了嗎？</p>
<p>有一點主婦最要注意的，就是不要把自己的弱點給女僕知道，因爲狡黠</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>的女僕會利用你的弱點，而滿足她的慾望的。譬如一個喜歡打牌的主婦，十天倒有九天半在打牌的，女僕就利用這弱點，每天替女主人拉「搭子」，這樣，她不但討好了主人，並且每天又有許多「外快——頭錢——進賬，還可以乘女主人無暇顧及家政時任意的玩笑偸懶。一個儒弱的優柔寡斷的主婦，若給女僕知道了她的弱點，女僕就要做出獨斷獨行，越俎代庖的行動了。</p>
<p>還有一點，就是主婦不要和女僕通同作弊，把女僕認爲「心腹人」，這樣最容易養成女僕跋扈的習氣。譬如一個喜歡賭博，却怕丈夫責問的主婦，她怕女僕吿訴她的丈夫，所以她就用金錢賄賂女僕，呌她不要吿訴主人，甚至賭本缺乏時向女僕吿貸，或以物品呌女僕去質當，第一次是命令式的，第二次是商量式的，第三次就成爲懇求式了，這樣女僕的氣燄就大盛，不但輕視主婦，而且漸漸的敎訓主婦，要挾主婦了。而主婦呢，到這時不但不敢得罪她，且要聯絡她，博她的歡心，仰她的鼻息，於是這女僕就成爲你的軍師，參謀，也就是你的附骨疽了。</p>

<h3 id="c202">文學中的自然與人物 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 錫榮</p>
<p>文藝的製作，怎樣描寫才能動人呢？這不能不從技術上下功夫。寫景，是文藝作品的重耍因素之一，要描寫自然，必須具有忠實的態度去觀察自然。作者在平時需要涵養一種愛好自然的習慣，而爲駕馭自然的主人，决不可作受命自然的傭僕。</p>
<p>自然的描寫可分爲輪廓的描寫，情調的描寫，色調的描寫三方面：</p>
<p>文藝也近于繪畫，要能使人讀後如入畫圖中，方爲盡了文學的能事。在浪漫主義時代，文學的技術往往側重于中觀的描寫，所以那時的作品多取材于作者身邊瑣事的描寫，多採用第一人稱的口吻。可是文藝思潮的巨浪已洶湧到新寫實的彼岸了，作品中不顯露作者居介的牠位，須以客觀的態度，透視生活的內層，發現它的美與醜，把牠赤裸裸的呈現于讀者之前，　是一種進步。所以文藝作品的自然描寫，也同樣客觀地精細地描寫出來，像繪畫一樣，這呌做「寫實」，是寫景技術的進步。</p>
<p>如何將那自然景物記置起來呢，這是我們須首先討論的：</p>
<p>一，中心點　大自然的景物雖然很龐雜，但可以採一個中心點，專力于這中心點的刻劃，而把共他部分當作陪襯觀。有一句老話呌做烘雲托月，中心點應爲月，至於雲的寫出，則僅爲托月的使命而來的。譬如：朱自淸作的「荷塘月色」篇，那里面曾說到高處的灌木，依稀的柳影，隱隱的遠山，點點的路燈光，但我們讀後所感覺的却只是「月色的淸新」。這是爲什麼緣故呢？爲那篇文章的中心描寫點是「月」故。</p>
<p>二，配景　除中心點外，一定還要配上近景和遠景，像繪畫一樣，畫一間孤零零的村舍，未免太感單調，在屋旁配上幾樹綠柳，這就是近景的記置，再于屋後配置依稀的遠山，這又配了遠景，這樣構造起來的一幅村舍圖，才覺得完美而諧和，不過這種配景，色彩不宜過分濃郁，大概中心點最濃，近景次之遠景又次之。</p>
<p>描寫景物之深刻者，輪廓而外，尙須賴深刻的銳敏的威覺。威覺是情的，故描寫「情調」亦爲描寫所必要。天空中同樣的掛着一輪明月，在愉快的人看來，「團　明月」益增無窮快感，但在憂鬱的人看來，則「凄凉月色」將使入不勝悲愁之戚。爲什麽同一月也，而入的情感竟會生出如此的懸殊呢？這是所引起的情調各有不同之故。盧隱女士的蓬萊美景中有所謂「超然有世外感」，「另有一種幽趣」，就是描寫情調的例子。</p>
<p>又，自然的色彩常與時候有關係，光綫有明，暗，强弱，自然界所表現的色彩也有不同。晴朗的天空呈現蔚藍色，使入起輕鬆愉快之感；陰暗的天空呈灰暗色，使人感沈悶抑鬱之氣。善寫自然者就從這許多頃刻變幻的色澤上着力注意，使全篇文字在色澤里顯現出興奮，和平，驚　，淡　，純潔等不同的情緒來。</p>
<p>接着我們要說到文學中的人物創造。郁達夫先生說：小說里的事件都係人演成的，人物當然是小說中最重要的要素。根據這種理解，我們對于人物的創造不能不致最大的努力了。魯迅先生的阿Q正傳，不僅奠定了中國文壇的趨向，並且他所創造的阿Q已成爲中國農民的典型表現。這就是一個好例子。</p>
<p>人的個性，習慣，行爲，思想，雖然各各不同，可是無論怎樣偉大的人物總脫不了時間的與空間的制限，時間的影饗是「時代」，空間的影響是「社會環境」和「自然環境」。</p>
<p>第一，時間的環境——如孔子生在周末春秋，當時的時代是尊王，重禮敎的時代，雖以孔子之賢，亦跳不出那個圈套，所以用二十世紀的現代眼光去批評他的思想，自然是枘鑿的。馬克斯生逢工業革命工廠制度發生資本主義昌盛之時，才能有社會主義，剩餘價値思想的醞釀：我們與其驚異馬克斯天賦之偉大，母寗說馬克斯實受當時時代精神之支配。</p>
<p>第二，空間的制限——空間的制限又可分爲社會環境的制限，和自然環境的制限。沒有一個人能脫離當時社會風俗，政治制度，經濟背景等等人爲環境的影響的；墨子正生在戰國相互殺戮極甚的社會里，政治家縱橫捭闔，日以攻戰爲事，遂有「視人之國，若視其國，視人之家，若視其家，視人之身，若視其身」的兼愛論。同樣的，沒有一個人能脫離自然環境的影饗：北方人多雄放，南方人多柔弱，在山谷里的人多頑固褊狹，住海濱的人多閒散風流，住鄕邨的人多忠實樸質，居都市的人多浮薄輕佻，這都是受自然環境之範圍。</p>
<p>創造人物，表現他的思想，行爲，情緒，也應以上述的時間，社會，自然爲背景，而刻劃到他的個性，心理。</p>
<p>個人的特性是某一人獨特的性質，是個別的，從這一人外，在他人中找不出同型的，才算個性。福祿貝爾說：世界上沒有兩個同樣的石，二枚同樣木葉，物各有其個性，若不能找出其個性，則不能描寫物，所以人物的描寫也須要表現個性。紅樓夢所以成爲中國章回小說的絕唱者，就因爲曹雪芹先生能把握大觀園中人物各個個性的特徵，而盡力刻劃的緣故。據說水滸傳的作者曾經把一百零八條好漢的容像預先繪成圖畫，日夕向之凝視揣摩，故他所表現的一百零八個人物乃成各各不同的個性。</p>
<p>郁達夫小說論中論人物有一段說：「作品中的人物大抵是典型的人物，所以較之實際社會的人物更爲有趣，總係具有一階級或一社會的特性者居多，例如Don　Quixote係具有夢想家的特性的代表，Hamlet係懐疑者的代表，Tartufe（毛利哀兒的喜劇中人）是僞善者的代表之類。作家的人物正因爲具有這一種Typical　traits　of　Characteristics的原因，纔能使大多數的讀者對作者的人物感到趣味。但這一種代表特性的抽象化，化得太厲害的時候，也容易使人物的個性（Individuality）失掉，變成寓言中的人物，如盤洋的天路歷程里的Christam　Hypocrite之類，或變成一種Caricature，使讀者感不出滿溢的實現味來，這一層是小說家創造人物最難之點，也是成功失敗的最大關頭。」這些理論眞是小說家的座右銘。</p>

<h3 id="c203">後樓日記（一） <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 叔羽</p>
<p>一九三○年九月八日</p>
<p>我是個貧困的薪水勞働者、不能有一天的賦閒的；可是如今我又失業將近兩個月，而這一次的失業也和前次失業一樣，把我以前千方百計所恢復過來的精神與物力逐漸地　　了！</p>
<p>寫日記彷彿只是有閒階級的一種特殊的享樂。在有職業的時候，我總是終日栗碌的，無暇握筆；趁現在侘傺無聊，愁煩苦悶之際，我正好和這小冊子親近，把我痛苦之一涓一滴向牠傾訴凈盡，積聚在牠裏面，使牠成爲我自己的影子，以分任我一切的不幸之重擔。</p>
<p>在時間卽金錢的現代畸形社會之下，卽使把一寸光陰一寸金這一層撇開不說，一個人太空閒了，究也非計之所得。近來我簡直空閒得乏味，——但這顯然是出於强迫，違反心理的，在事實上我自己却並不游手好閒，——終日寂寂，抑鬱寡歡，因此，當我開始寫這日記時，我又覺得無事可記了。</p>
<p>生活畢竟是太空虛了！除了吃飯和睡覺兩件大事之外，更沒有別的可以充實牠的內容，也無心看書。在意氣日趨消沉，精神逐漸頹廢懶散之中，這兩月來我差不多不大意識到空間和時間。整天整天的把自己幽閉在一間狹籠似的不室裏，什麽地方都不願跑，也不能跑，甚至不敢從窗縫裏窺視到外面黃金和白玉築成的繁榮的都市。我也不大記得日子和時辰，也從來沒有軍過日曆一類的東西。眞的，像在辦公廳裏簽到那樣的玩意兒——不！現在想來，這倒是一件樂事，——也已有好久不曾鬧着了。我不再留心到那一天是星期日可以休息，或是那幾天不是星期日應該辦公；對於時光的流駛，歲月的推移，或是季節的變換，我全然不加以注意。若不是昨天那位女房東這樣的問我：「那末，你幾時搬來呢？明天好嗎？明天是八號。」我委實還不曉得今天是什麽日子呢！「九月」彷彿還聽見誰提起過，但「八號」就有些模糊了。</p>
<p>那位女房東的一副略帶長方形而平扁的嘴臉，眞是再合適不過的，連出錢都買不到的一本活動日曆。她把日子很正確地報吿給我聽了。我答應她於十四日遷居到她那裏去。</p>
<p>記得日子和愛惜光陰，在我眞是一件非常愚蠢的事。近來我對於我這種困苦顚連的生活，確乎比以前更覺得厭倦了。我惟有希望時間迅速地消逝過去，以縮短我那每天只是爲生活忙的，無用的生命。我患的是「生活病」，而「死」却是一味對症的藥！這是我在近代醫學上的一種新發明。</p>

<p>Advising Against Independent Action, Eagerly Awaiting Early Arrival in the Capital</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the Guangdong-Guangxi armies entered southern Hunan, the entire nation has been alarmed. Vice Chairman Feng Yuxiang of the Military Affairs Commission and Central Committee member Li Liejun jointly telegraphed Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi on the 9th of this month, offering deep advice and encouragement. Feng Yuxiang further telegraphed Bai Chongxi on the 10th, cautioning him against independent action and urging him to come to the capital as soon as possible to participate in the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. The main points of the two telegrams are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"To Mr. Li Delin of Nanning and Mr. Bai Jiansheng, Greetings. Privately, thinking of you, my good friends, I always regret not being able to meet. Reading your telegrams of the 2nd and 4th, I am even more impressed. The ancients taught, 'Work together in harmony, plan before acting.' Military strategy values the Changshan snake formation. Sun Tzu spoke of it with utmost urgency. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek does not indulge in fine food and music. He cares for the dead, asks about the sick, and cares for orphans and the bereaved, originally desiring to fulfill the will of the people. Bing Shi and friends, familiar with military strategy, must especially be aware of the intent to quickly defeat the enemy, understand what to avoid, and, those who desire to promote national unity, must be humble in seeking it. I am with you in spirit as I send this telegram, believing that both you gentlemen agree. Urgent."</p>
<p>"To Mr. Bai Jiansheng of Nanning, Greetings. Privately, I believe your telegram of the 9th has been received. This time, Guangdong and Guangxi are generously volunteering, although foreign reports may contain errors. However, I deeply believe that a wise man like Jiansheng can await the Central Government's overall plan and not engage in independent action, demonstrating division. Chairman Chiang's words are extremely sincere. I wholeheartedly assist, based on my long-held aspirations. The Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee is approaching. I sincerely hope that you gentlemen can come to the Central Government early. I respectfully offer this reply and await further news. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)"</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 13th, Wang Chonghui telegraphed Chen Jitang, Xiao Focheng, Li Zongren, and others, stating, "Having read your letter, I am deeply gratified by your earnest commitment to saving the country and the people. Although I am inadequate, I have always been committed to sincere unity and concerted resistance against foreign aggression. Therefore, since returning to the country, I have consistently adhered to this principle, appealing between Nanjing and Guangdong, deeply hoping that comrades can remember the gravity of the national crisis and trust and help each other to save the country from danger. Today, comrades in Guangdong and Guangxi are earnestly committed to saving the country, which is in fact the same as the Central Government's intent. However, there may be room for deliberation and discussion regarding the methods of implementation. If we do not first pay attention to this and hastily send troops to neighboring provinces, I fear we will repeat the mistakes of past internal conflicts, violating the original intention of resisting foreign aggression, and merely benefit others. If you gentlemen intend to save the country, I urge you to avoid internal strife, immediately order the advancing troops to cease their advance, and send responsible comrades to negotiate with the Central Government and attend the Second Plenary Session to jointly formulate a unified strategy for saving the country. In this way, the Central Government and local authorities will have a spirit of cooperation and no regrets of division, which is what I earnestly pray for. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)"</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The China Society for the League of Nations telegraphed various locations across the country today (the 11th), urging a unified appeal to the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities to cease military action. The original telegram is as follows: "To newspaper offices and organizations in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Wuzhou, Regarding the current critical situation in North China, as the Central Government's troops move to defend the border, Guangdong and Guangxi suddenly use resistance against Japan as a pretext, pointing their weapons inward. It is a well-known fact that Guangxi has hired numerous Japanese military advisors, as many as two hundred, and has received military supplies from them. Guangdong has recently transported twenty million in cash to purchase military supplies from its eastern neighbor. Under such circumstances, the purpose of raising these troops is self-evident, and the consequences are unimaginable. We believe that if we are to resist foreign enemies, we must prepare with a unified purpose, and any action must be united across the country. If internal conflicts arise at this time, it will only create opportunities for the enemy to encroach upon the North and the entire country. Our compatriots across the country should not sit idly by and watch the country perish without speaking out. We implore our compatriots in various regions to jointly appeal to the Southwest to cease this kind of free action, abandon personal grievances, and jointly address the national crisis in order to save the precarious situation and resist foreign aggression. Yours sincerely, China Society for the League of Nations, True. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)"</p>
<p>Ba County: Twenty-six commissioners from Sichuan and Guizhou jointly telegraphed the generals in the Southwest yesterday, issuing a warning, hoping that during this period of severe national crisis, they would pull back from the brink and avoid harming the nation's foundation.

<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, five Japanese warships sailed into Xiamen last night, mooring outside Gulangyu.

<p>(Nanjing) Qin Fen returned to Nanjing from Hankou on the morning of the 13th. According to him, after arriving in Zhengzhou, he immediately consulted with Yang Yongtai and others to discuss remedies for the breached dike. Nine articles of post-disaster measures were decided upon and are being implemented. He has reported the progress to Kong Xiangxi. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) After inspecting the breach in the Yaodi dike, Qin Fen returned to Hankou on a special boat on the 13th, then transferred to a plane to return to Nanjing. He decided to request 630,000 for post-disaster relief from the Executive Yuan. Kong Xiangrong, on Kong Xiangxi's orders, came to Hankou to discuss the progress of the project and is expected to arrive here on the 17th. (13th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) President Chiang hosted a banquet at Vice President Kong's residence at 7:00 PM on the 13th for Wang Chonghui, Zhang Xueliang, and other important figures, inviting heads of various Yuan, Ministries, and Commissions of the Central Government to accompany them. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Chonghui arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 13th with his secretaries Feng Zhizheng and Liu Yinglin. Central Committee members Chen Bulei and Ma Chaojun welcomed him at the station. He went to the Lingyuan New Village to rest temporarily. At noon, he attended a banquet hosted by President Sun, accompanied by Ye Chucang, Li Wenfan, Ma Chaojun, Liang Hancao, Fu Bingchang, and others. In the afternoon at 3:00 PM, he visited President Chiang and met with old friends in Beijing. Wang, whose nasal illness has not fully recovered, plans to stay in Beijing for two or three days before returning to Shanghai to recuperate. Wang said that as the national crisis deepens, it is urgently necessary for the whole country to unite in spirit and cooperate with a unified approach to resolve the national crisis. Regarding the entry of troops from Guangdong and Guangxi into Hunan province, he had telegraphed urging them to desist, saying that saving the country and ensuring its survival requires a collective effort to be effective. Independent action will inevitably aggravate the national crisis. After the Guangdong side initiated the action, they sent a letter to him, and he was deeply saddened that they had gone so far. He said that if the Guangdong authorities could immediately pull back from the brink, peace would still be hopeful, but this hope now depends on the Guangdong side realizing this quickly. Rumors that he would travel south to persuade the Guangdong troops to stop moving north are not true. In the current situation, even if he is willing to work for unity, he has no intention of traveling south before the Guangdong side has made a sincere expression of repentance. In short, resisting aggression and saving the country depends on unity, otherwise, it will only grieve those who are close and gladden those who are enemies. Sun Ke also said that he was deeply saddened by the independent action of the Guangdong and Guangxi troops. The steps to save the country should be unified. He had telegraphed Chen Bonan and others, asking them to prioritize the nation and the people and stop military action. As for rumors that Mr. Wang Liangchou would travel south to earnestly persuade the Guangdong and Guangxi troops to stop moving north, he has not heard anything about it at present. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Chonghui's illness has gradually recovered. Because the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities have dispatched troops north, in order to negotiate with the central authorities, he took the night train from Shanghai to Beijing on the 12th and arrived at 7:00 AM on the 13th. Chen Bulei and Ma Chaojun went to the station to welcome him. Wang went to Sun Ke's residence to rest and met with Sun for discussions. He then visited Chairman Chiang and other important figures of the Central Government to discuss everything. Wang will stay in Beijing for two or three days and then return to Shanghai.

<p>— Du</p>
<p>-- The Responsibility of Everyone During the National Crisis --</p>
<p>Since the Guangdong-Guangxi situation changed, the situation on the Hunan border has suddenly become critical. Although news of troop movements is still varied, public anxiety has reached its peak. Today's national situation is like a dilapidated house about to collapse, battered by wind and rain. The difficult situation worsens day by day. How can we tolerate the evil drama of "cooking beans with bean stalks" again, giving foreigners the opportunity to take advantage of our weaknesses? Everyone agrees that there should be no dissent. This is why telegrams calling for peace have been published in newspapers these past few days.</p>
<p>While the nation's attention is focused on the Southwest, the evolution of the situation in North China should not be easily dismissed. Since the increase in troops, diplomacy in Hebei and Chahar has effectively stalled, and the smuggling situation has worsened daily. The sudden occurrence of a bombing incident further reveals the lurking future disasters. With the southern country now stirring up trouble, the serious situation in the north has an additional dimension of threat. Although the surface does not show signs of escalating tension, the behind-the-scenes activities are clear to everyone. Those who have been plotting will seize every opportunity to satisfy their greedy desires. Under these circumstances, the precariousness is self-evident.</p>
<p>According to recent statements from the Hebei and Chahar authorities, they will not succumb to pressure from foreign forces and invite disintegration. All officers and soldiers of the Twenty-ninth Army have repeatedly stated their determination to remain internally focused and not be used by any party. All this reflects the strong sense of unease in the Tianjin-Beiping area and the difficult situation of the local authorities. We believe that if those involved can truly uphold the will of the people without shame and sincerely obey the Central Government, then the current complicated situation may still be able to coexist for a time. One party's desire is to obtain the greatest gain at the lowest cost. The tactics they use are nothing more than threats and bribes, and the objects they rely on are traitors and internal strife. If everyone can see through this and encourage each other, then even if the fire is not completely extinguished, the ambitious at least know that they cannot guarantee complete victory.</p>
<p>With the national strength declining to this point, the authorities have the responsibility of maintaining peace, and we also understand their efforts. However, two points must be clearly recognized and consistently observed by everyone: First, do not be provoked; second, do not be exploited. Avoid emotional conflicts, assert self-respect, and strive to promote sincere unity in order to jointly relieve the national crisis. These are the minimum conditions of compliance and the responsibility of every citizen.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Important Remarks by a Certain Standing Committee Member of the Central Government on the Current Situation; Guangdong and Guangxi's Three Requests Require Overall Decision First; Second Plenary Session to Jointly Discuss Steps to Deal With the Current Situation <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to foreign telegrams yesterday, the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities have sent a sincere telegram (dated the 11th) in reply to the Central Government, requesting three points, etc. On the 13th, a reporter specially visited a certain Standing Committee member of the Central Government to inquire about the contents of the telegram. According to the reply, in order to cope with the national crisis, the whole country must be united, and there must be no divergence. Moreover, since it concerns the survival of the country, the steps must be carefully studied, and they must not be implemented according to the wishes of a few people. Therefore, the Central Government has decided to convene the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in early next month to jointly decide on the appropriate steps to deal with the current situation, and has telegraphed to invite the responsible comrades of Guangdong and Guangxi to participate, so that appropriate decisions can be made according to the will of the whole body. As for the three requests mentioned, such as designating the routes of troop movements, concentration points, and supplying military equipment, etc., these are matters within the steps. If there is an overall decision first, these kinds of problems are easy to solve. Now, the troops of Guangdong and Guangxi have actually taken free action and invaded southern Hunan. Although external sources have reported that they have some background or some excuse, the Central Government does not lightly believe them. However, from the point of view of internal affairs or military administration, they have deviated from the usual practice and only show people the weakness of division and inconsistency. Moreover, without being mobilized, moving troops to neighboring provinces, marching troops on the road, and then asking the Central Government what to do, directly trying to coerce the whole country with blind action, it is no wonder that people in various places are alarmed, various circles have sent telegrams of advice, and even think that they are using the name as a cover, but in fact they have other intentions. A few days ago, the Central Government had uniformly moved the troops stationed south of Hengzhou north in order to avoid conflict. It is hoped that the responsible comrades of Guangdong and Guangxi will wake up, immediately order the troops entering Hunan to return to their original defense, and immediately send personnel to Beijing to jointly plan a major plan. Central Government officials can follow the decisions of the conference in everything. The national crisis is such that everything cannot be done alone, increasing the suffering of the people of the two provinces and leaving endless disasters for the country.

<p>Railway Staff Intervene and Are Beaten; Notification Given to Japanese Police Station to Arrest</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 11:00 AM on the 12th, on the Jinpu southbound Train 305, more than fifty ronin, carrying 120 packages of sugar and rayon each, and seven bundles of cigarette paper, drove ticketed passengers off the train and forcibly occupied four passenger cars, fully loading them with their goods. Railway staff who intervened were beaten. The railway bureau notified the Japanese police station, which dispatched Chief Kumagai and many others to crack down. The ronin did not listen and smashed the car windows. They were eventually arrested, and the train departed twenty minutes late. The Japanese stated to the railway side that they would severely punish them. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A certain concession in Tianjin currently holds 200,000 packages of smuggled sugar. The original price, including labor, was 17 yuan per package. Recently, due to strict anti-smuggling measures in the southern section of the Jinpu Line, smuggling is not easy, and the price has fallen to 14.9 yuan per package. Smugglers are suffering heavy losses. On the 13th, a meeting was held at the Japanese Club, and eighty smuggling traders formed an organization to transport goods south by force. On the evening of the 13th, many people were dispatched to transport 450 tons to Jinan, all loaded on Jinpu Train 305. The remaining goods will be transported successively. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Due to the dumping of smuggled goods, the business of various merchants in Tianjin has plummeted. They plan to hold a meeting within days to imitate the methods of Shanghai merchants, automatically refuse to sell smuggled goods, and form a team to investigate. Violators will be reported to the authorities for investigation. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Municipal Government, Chamber of Commerce, and Capital Promote Domestic Goods Association, because of the saying that smuggled goods have flowed to this capital, notified each industry association to be responsible for reporting the sale of smuggled goods. The Domestic Goods Association sends personnel daily to assist in anti-smuggling efforts, and plans to check door-to-door by responsible organizations. All goods without official tickets will be asked about their source, and if there is any ambiguity, they will be punished according to anti-smuggling regulations. According to the person in charge of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, smuggled goods are most often rayon and white sugar. Nanjing is not a factory area and has no rayon customers, and the sale of white sugar is very common. There may be smuggled goods in various parts of the interior, but none have been found in the capital. (14th Dispatch)</p>

According to Zhou, two weeks ago, there were slight rumors in Beiping and Tianjin, but after the local authorities expressed their firm determination to safeguard sovereignty, the people's hearts have stabilized. In recent days, due to the news of the Guangdong and Guangxi troops' dispatch, people's hearts have turned to worry again. The people of Beiping and Tianjin, living in a dangerous situation, deeply know that at this time, a glimmer of hope is for the whole country to unite to resist foreign aggression. If there are any chaotic steps, it is tantamount to creating opportunities for strong neighbors. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e28">Questions and Answers Between a Japanese Reporter and Rose <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Saying that Japan can understand that Britain will not act alone</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The questions and answers between Lees-Rose and the press corps are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Reporter: You strongly advocate for cooperation between Britain and Japan in China. However, does Britain intend to cooperate with Japan on trade issues in countries other than China?</p>
<p>Rose: The issue of cooperation between Britain and Japan on trade issues in countries other than China was discussed at the Anglo-Japanese consultations the year before last. In my opinion, the reason why Japanese goods are hindered from entering countries other than Britain is overproduction. To alleviate this situation, it is necessary to eliminate useless competition. Japan itself also needs to reflect on this.</p>
<p>Reporter: When competition is eliminated, if countries with vast territories and abundant resources like Britain benefit, countries with small territories and scarce resources like Japan will be at a great disadvantage. In this situation, does Britain have any plans to provide convenience to Japan?</p>
<p>Rose: This question is incomprehensible. Although Japan's resources are scarce, it can purchase raw materials cheaply from foreign countries. Therefore, if Japan wants to overcome the current difficulties, it should restrict production and raise prices. Britain intends to implement competition not only in China, but also in any situation based on mutual agreement.</p>
<p>Reporter: What are your views on Japan's special position in the East?</p>
<p>Rose: Japan is a stabilizing force in the East and bears a major responsibility.</p>
<p>Reporter: The authorities believe that it is too early to implement economic aid to China at present, and that a political solution is a prerequisite. During your visit to Japan this time, you suggested to the Japanese government the need for investment in Chinese railways and the rectification of interests in North China, giving us the impression that you are acting as an advocate for the Chinese government. However, according to the Japanese government, you should advise the Chinese government to correct its attitude towards Japan, which would contribute significantly to opening up Sino-Japanese relations. What are your thoughts on this?</p>
<p>Rose: I am not an advocate for the Chinese government. I am only inspecting China for my own purposes. You urge me to advise the Chinese government, but I am an economic expert and do not want to interfere in political issues. Also, Japan currently has the opinion of eradicating the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese people in the interior are living in difficult conditions, which is why the Communist Party exists. To eradicate the Chinese Communist Party, it is necessary to stabilize the lives of its people. Building railways in China and improving the living conditions of farmers will make it possible to export Japanese goods and benefit Japanese industrialists.</p>
<p>Reporter: Which areas in China are targeted for railway construction?</p>
<p>Rose: China is the country with the fewest railways in the world, so railways should be built everywhere.</p>
<p>Reporter: It is heard that the Japanese government will provide aid to China with materials. Has a concrete plan been obtained for this?</p>
<p>Rose: A concrete plan has not yet been decided, but I am pleased to hear that the Japanese government has this intention.</p>
<p>Reporter: If Japan is unwilling to provide joint aid to China, will Britain provide aid alone? If aid is provided alone, what will be the extent of it?</p>
<p>Rose: Since the Japanese government has already expressed its intention to provide joint aid to China, I believe that this kind of problem will not occur at present.</p>
<p>Reporter: Does the Japanese government have any concrete proposals for the construction of railways in China and the reorganization of the central bank?</p>
<p>Rose: When improving China's external credit, it is not possible to propose these concrete plans. From the perspective of this improvement in external credit, China's tariff issue has great significance. There should be a clear description of this matter. As for the reorganization of the central bank, I have also made considerable efforts. The Chinese authorities are also working hard on this, but the specific results are unknown.</p>
<p>Reporter: Then what is the main goal of the central bank's reorganization?</p>
<p>Rose: Its organization is intended to emulate the Bank of Japan, thereby promoting it.</p>
<p>Reporter: What are your views on the new Sino-US agreement recently concluded in Washington?</p>
<p>Rose: The case has not been formally announced, so its content is unknown, but it is undoubtedly beneficial to China. However, this matter has nothing to do with Britain.</p>
<p>Reporter: It is said that the increase or decrease in China's tariff revenue has great significance for China's revival, but I don't know how to solve this problem. To solve this problem, what kind of assistance from Japan is considered necessary?</p>
<p>Rose: The decrease in China's tariff revenue is mainly due to fluctuations in silver prices and "special trade" in North China. However, this solution is a political issue, and I am not in a position to express my opinion, etc. (Kyodo News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>The Situation of the US Presidential Election: Roosevelt Can Be Re-elected; The Republican Party Nominated Knox as the Vice-Presidential Candidate; Borah Disagrees with Landon's Financial Policy</p>
<p>(Washington) Although Kansas Governor Landon and Chicago newspaper publisher Knox have been selected as the Republican candidates for President and Vice President, incumbent President Roosevelt still has the upper hand in the presidential election campaign. Neutral observers believe that the election of Landon and Knox will not seriously jeopardize Roosevelt's chances. The betting odds on Roosevelt's election on Wall Street are eight to five. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Cleveland: The Republican National Convention today unanimously nominated Chicago publisher Knox as the Vice-Presidential candidate, with 1,003 delegates in attendance. (National News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Cleveland: The selection of Landon and Knox as the Republican candidates for President and Vice President is largely due to William Hearst's newspapers. Landon relied on Hearst's newspapers across the country to promote him, rising from an obscure state politician to a national figure. Knox is famous for handling the sales affairs of Hearst's newspapers. The delegates to the convention are now returning home, and everyone wants to ask, "What about Borah?" Borah, after Landon telegraphed the convention, stating that after stabilizing the currency, his determination to leave the party has become stronger. When he arrived in Washington, he refused to announce whether he supported Landon, saying only that he did not know what Landon's words on gold meant. If he intends to restore the gold standard, then his political views are completely different. Borah also said that he had no objection to Knox's election as the Vice-Presidential candidate. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Experts here believe that the Republican campaign platform clearly does not include the Far East issue, which proves that the party does not want to get involved in the Far East vortex. The platform is silent on the Open Door Policy, the silver issue, and the Philippine issues, which shows that the party is now paying attention to domestic issues, and its enthusiasm for the Far East is not as strong as before. Those familiar with the Far East issue are surprised that the party's campaign platform failed to directly or indirectly mention the Open Door Policy. The platform also does not have a single word of criticism about the government's silver purchase program. According to observers familiar with current affairs, the reason why the silver issue was not mentioned is obviously due to Senator Borah's opposition. The party was quite unsure of what to do with the silver issue when drafting the platform, because supporting the silver purchase policy would harm the interests of hard money advocates in the eastern states, and opposing it would incur the displeasure of the mining areas in the western valley states. Regarding the issue of currency stabilization, the party has little understanding of the currencies of China and Japan, and its wording is empty and unimportant. Regarding the navy and army, the platform only has the phrase "strengthening military power," so the party has little clear expression on this issue. The phrase in the platform protecting the domestic market from the dumping of cheap goods naturally includes Japan, but because the wording is vague, there is no anti-Japanese sentiment. (National News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Ogden: The chairman of the National Veterans Association, Sanders, declared today that the National Veterans Republican Party platform ignores the Red Menace, so it cannot be endorsed, and said that the platform should include an article stating that recognition of the Soviet Union will be withdrawn if the Soviet Union continues to propagate communism in the United States. (National News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Dallas: President Roosevelt also said today that he will take avoiding foreign disputes and curbing commercial monopolies as the government's policy direction. He firmly guarantees that the United States will not be involved in the vortex of European and Asian disputes. The United States hopes to assist international undertakings, thereby serving as a standard for unity, cooperation, and friendship, but this assistance is only of a moral nature. This afternoon, the President also spoke at the Cotton Exchange here, saying that if monopolies are not curbed, the United States will only have hotels and no families. I oppose the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few people, so I firmly declare that I will vigorously maintain the interests of small businesses and workers. The result of a few people controlling economic power will make labor a commodity. If we tolerate this fact, we will abandon the freedom given by history. What we need is not hotels but families. We have now democratized politics, and in the future, we will democratize opportunities. (National News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Dallas: President Roosevelt recently delivered a speech at the "Centennial Celebration of Texas's Admission to the United States," which has been recorded in another dispatch. Here is a supplement: He said, "We in the United States have promoted national ideas and also promoted international ideas, and we should maintain a peaceful situation." Although the United States is willing to encourage all countries in the world to pursue a good neighborly and sincere foreign policy, it should clearly tell all countries that in the event of danger in the future, the United States can only provide assistance in spirit." (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Cleveland: Knox has now been nominated as the Republican candidate for Vice President of the United States. He initially ran a small newspaper in Michigan, famous for criticizing corruption, and then appeared in politics, with unhindered eloquence. To this day, he has devoted himself to the newspaper industry. Since Roosevelt took office, he has written articles criticizing him with all his might, even believing that Roosevelt's policies endanger the American political system. In September of last year, the Illinois Republican State Committee approved his participation in the presidential race, and at the same time, he won the majority of votes in the state's primary election.

<p>Anglo-Russian Naval Conference: Russia Did Not Demand Equal Rights</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Anglo-Russian naval talks, it was rumored that Britain had in principle recognized that the Soviet Navy in the Pacific should be on an equal footing with the Japanese Navy. Officials here solemnly denied this. Naval figures also said that this news is incomprehensible, because the agreement to be established between Britain and Russia is purely a qualitative restriction method. Regarding this, the Soviet Union did not demand equal rights. What it demanded was that if Japan does not accept the existing naval treaties of Britain, the United States, and France for one day, then the Soviet Union will not abide by the qualitative restriction methods stipulated in these treaties for one day, and will reserve the right to build a fleet in the Pacific. Naval figures also said that the future naval agreement between Britain and Russia will be issued in the form of an exchange of letters. Its content is that if Japan does not violate the existing naval treaties of Britain, the United States, and France, then the Soviet Union will naturally abide by the future naval agreement between Britain and Russia. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>British Destroyer Increase Plan: The United States Advocates Using the Escalator Clause</p>
<p>(London) In May, the British government sent a memorandum to the signatory countries of the London Naval Treaty (1920), namely the United States and Japan, requesting that the country's total destroyer tonnage still be set at 190,000 tons (the Sea Treaty stipulated 150,000 tons). As for the 10,000-ton cruisers, there are a total of four that should be destroyed according to the treaty. The country also requested that one of them be converted into a training ship, and the other three be converted into Class B cruisers, which would still be allowed to be retained. The United States government immediately submitted an answer, stating that the country does not oppose this request in principle, but as far as the London Sea Treaty is concerned, Britain should invoke Article 21 of the treaty, namely the "Escalator Clause." The Japanese government recently submitted a verbal answer through its chargé d'affaires, Fujii, and notified Britain of the total tonnage of destroyers and submarines that the country should destroy in accordance with the treaty but wanted to retain. Well-informed sources believe that if Britain had adopted the answer proposed by the United States at that time, that is, implemented the escalator clause, then the situation of this case would definitely have been changed, that is, Japan would have no reason to make equivalent demands.

<p>German University of Frankfurt: Opening of the Chinese Academy</p>
<p>Ambassador Cheng Speaks on Sino-German Relations</p>
<p>(Berlin) The new building of the Chinese Academy of the University of Frankfurt and the affiliated museum have now been completed. Chinese Ambassador Dr. Cheng Tianfang recently presided over the opening ceremony and delivered a speech, stating that since China and Germany signed a treaty of reconciliation on May 20, 1921, based on the principle of equality of rights, the friendship between the two sides has been unbroken and is a model of international relations. China is a raw material producing country, while Germany is a major industrial country, which can complement each other. This is why the trade between the two sides has developed endlessly. At this time, China's domestic transportation industry has been improved, and its natural resources have also been developed more, which can help the rapid development of trade between the two sides. At this point, Ambassador Cheng also elaborated on the philosophical concepts of China for more than 2,000 years, saying that they have many similarities with the modern philosophy of certain Western countries. China and Germany should cooperate in culture. It is a pity that certain European countries still have misunderstandings about the situation in China. The Chinese Academy of the University of Frankfurt will be able to dispel them. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>Full Text of the Draft Soviet Constitution (Part 1)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union passed the following resolution: "The Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, based on the report of Stalin, Chairman of the Constitutional Commission, hereby makes the following resolutions: Approve the draft Constitution of the Soviet Union proposed by the Constitutional Commission of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union; convene the All-Union Congress of Soviets to study the draft Constitution of the Soviet Union; stipulate that the All-Union Congress of Soviets will open on November 25, 1936; publish the draft Constitution of the Soviet Union for national discussion."</p>

<p>Chapter 1: Social Organization</p>
<p>Article 1: The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is a socialist state of workers and peasants.</p>
<p>Article 2: The political foundation of the Soviet Union is composed of Soviets of Workers' Deputies. These Soviets have grown and become stronger due to the overthrow of the landlord and bourgeois regime and the establishment of the proletarian dictatorship.</p>
<p>Article 3: All power in the Soviet Union belongs to the workers in urban and rural areas, in the form of Soviets of Workers' Deputies.</p>
<p>Article 4: The economic foundation of the Soviet Union is the socialist economic system and the socialist public ownership of the means and instruments of production.

<p>Jerusalem: A British police officer was attacked twice yesterday. In one incident, Deputy Superintendent Sigrid was seriously wounded. Sigrid, accompanied by a police officer, was patrolling in a car when, while driving between the St. Stephen's Gate and the Herod's Gate, they were shot at by two people hiding in a dark corner. Sigrid was hit by a bullet, seriously wounding his chest and shoulder. The police officer in the car immediately returned fire, felling one of the assailants. He died shortly after in the hospital. Police dogs are currently tracking down the other assailant. The residence of Farah Tye, Deputy Superintendent of Police in Nazareth, was also shot at during the night. It is widely believed that Sigrid was attacked because Arabs were jealous of his dedication to duty. Last night, a passenger train was bombed while traveling to Kalkilya, seriously injuring four Jews and slightly injuring twelve Jews and one Arab. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<p>Athens: German Economic Minister and President of the Central Bank, Dr. Schacht, arrived here at noon today from the capital of Yugoslavia. He is scheduled to meet with the President of the National Bank of Greece and other important figures from political and financial circles this afternoon. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Athens: Dr. Schacht, the German Economic Minister and President of the Central Bank, is scheduled to arrive here today from the capital of Yugoslavia. People in Greek financial and economic circles attach great importance to this trip. The newspaper "Proia" reported that "One-third of Greece's exports go to Germany. Schacht's visit aims to solve the problem of debt compensation and to further develop Germany's economic influence in Greece, seeking outlets for the country's heavy industry. This is no different from what Schacht is pursuing in other Balkan countries." (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia: Dr. Schacht, the German Economic Minister and President of the Central Bank, arrived here yesterday from Germany. That evening, he gave a speech at the German Embassy, explaining that the economic structures of Germany and Yugoslavia can be mutually beneficial, and that the economic relationship between the two countries has great potential for development. As for the purpose of Schacht's visit, there is no clear official announcement. Some people say that as a result of Schacht's visit, agricultural products from the southeastern region of the country will be purchased in large quantities by Germany. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e31">British Chancellor Favors Lifting Sanctions: Great Shock in All Circles; French and Belgian Ambassadors Visit the British Foreign Office; British Labour Party Leader Sternly Criticizes <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(London) Chancellor Chamberlain's speech on June 10, advocating the lifting of sanctions against Italy, has caused great shock in diplomatic and political circles. The French and Belgian ambassadors to London both visited the Foreign Office today to discuss the impact of this speech. It is reported that although the Chancellor's so-called change of attitude by Britain has not yet been formally endorsed by the government, France and Belgium are both greatly surprised. The British government believes that since Argentina has recently suggested lifting sanctions against Italy, it would be unbefitting of Britain, as a major power, to hide behind South American countries. Therefore, Britain may take the lead in this matter. However, even if sanctions are to be lifted, this should not be taken as Britain's recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Oxford, England: Major Attlee, leader of the opposition Labour Party in the House of Commons, recently delivered a speech here, expressing dissatisfaction with Chancellor Chamberlain's remarks against tightening sanctions. He said: "At a time when the world is facing a crisis, it is regrettable that a powerful nation like England is governed by people who are indecisive." The National Government, through Foreign Secretary Eden, has declared to the world that it intends to uphold peace and must take risks. At the same time, it has advised the people to support collective security mechanisms and the rule of law. Now, Chancellor Chamberlain says that what was done before should be reversed. Why is this? "If the Chancellor's words do not represent the government, then is it not strange that the Chancellor, at a time of national crisis, expresses his views on foreign policy in a personal capacity?" (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) The Welsh branch of the League of Nations Union and other organizations have expressed opposition to Chancellor Chamberlain's speech. They have resolved to send telegrams to Prime Minister Baldwin, Foreign Secretary Eden, and Chancellor Chamberlain, saying, "The Chancellor's remarks are astounding, and this association is very dissatisfied." (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) According to general observation, Foreign Secretary Eden will likely make a statement to the House of Commons before the Extraordinary Meeting of the League of Nations Council, explaining that the Italian-Abyssinian war has now ended. Therefore, the current sanctions measures are of no benefit to continue implementing in the long run. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will also issue a statement, reaffirming his guarantee that Italy is still willing to participate in the work of appeasing Europe and promising that all Italian facilities in Abyssinia will be based on generosity and freedom, and that the inherent rights of the natives will be recognized.

<p>Sanctions Are Not a Permanent Task, Emphasis on Anglo-German Understanding</p>
<p>(London) Chancellor Chamberlain's speech advocated the lifting of sanctions against Italy and mentioned a document distributed by Viscount Cecil to the members of the League of Nations, in which he urged the members to pressure the government to continue implementing sanctions, and even intensify them. The Chancellor criticized this policy, saying that it would cause future harm. Today, The Times published an editorial criticizing the Chancellor's speech, saying that it is a mistake for Britain to unilaterally exert pressure and allow Italian goods to enter, just as the opposite action of imposing sanctions six months ago was a mistake. The so-called "sanctions," which were mistakenly called, are not a permanent task. Since they were jointly implemented as a test, they can only be jointly terminated. This is something that everyone knows. After encountering an international failure in using the League of Nations Covenant to contain war, the general public is paying attention to the proper repair of peace institutions (both positive and negative), and how and when the powers concerned can decide to terminate their attempted passive economic resistance plan against aggression is secondary. The report also strongly stated that the exchange of views between Britain and Germany is of constructive value and is conducive to general peace in Europe. It is now urgent to clear the thorns in the way so that British Ambassador Sir Phipps can go to Berlin to engage in negotiations. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The British government raised questions with Germany at the beginning of last month, but the German government has not yet responded. The National Socialist Party has not indicated when the reply will be submitted, and their tone suggests that Führer Hitler is quite embarrassed by the British questions and is finding it difficult to submit a reply for the time being. Diplomatic circles believe that the government may wait until after the Extraordinary Meetings of the League of Nations Council and Assembly before responding. Moreover, the British questions are detailed, clear, and precise, so the German reply may use generalized language to avoid answering directly. Close associates of Führer Hitler recently declared that since the German government officially announced the abolition of the Locarno Treaty on March 7, it has repeatedly issued declarations and diplomatic documents expressing its desire for peace. However, the British questions still show suspicion and distrust, which is regrettable. (Havas, 13th)</p>

<p>Using Article 11 of the Covenant as the Backbone, Each Country Can Reserve Its Position on Article 16</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the discussion on the reorganization of the League of Nations, "L'Agence Économique" recently reported that the Spanish representative to the League of Nations, Madariaga, yesterday distributed a "Confidential Note on the Amendment of the Implementation Methods of the League of Nations Covenant" to certain member states. The content stated that the original text of the Covenant should not be amended, but the implementation methods could be changed. On the one hand, it advocated that all member states should be able to adopt a reserved attitude when implementing the various sanction measures stipulated in Article 16 of the Covenant. On the other hand, it also proposed adding an annex, based on Article 11 of the Covenant, and inviting the United States, Japan, and Germany to sign and participate, so as to prevent war. According to Article 11 of the Covenant: "It is hereby declared that any war or threat of war, whether directly or indirectly affecting any Member of the League, is a matter of concern to the entire League, and the League shall take action to safeguard peace among nations. At the request of any Member of the League, the Secretary-General shall immediately convene a meeting of the Council. It is also declared that any circumstance affecting international relations which threatens to disturb international peace or good understanding between nations is the right of any Member of the League to bring to the attention of the Assembly or the Council in a friendly manner."

<p>Labor Strikes Largely Resolved</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, after a full day of debate, the Chamber of Deputies passed the government's forty-hour work week bill by a vote of 385 to 175. At the same time, the strike situation continued to ease. It is estimated that 200,000 workers have returned to work in the past 24 hours. Labor and management in the metallurgical factories signed a collective contract at the Ministry of the Interior tonight, which is the most important aspect of resolving the strikes. The dock workers in Le Havre threatened to strike, but this was canceled because the employers had agreed to increase wages by 12 percent. The situation in the north has improved significantly today. 35 factories in Lille and 38 factories in Roubaix have started work. Currently, only over 10,000 people in Valenciennes are still insisting on not returning to work. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies met this morning to discuss the 40-hour work week system bill. After eight hours of discussion, it was finally passed by a vote of 385 to 175. Thus, all five bills on social and labor issues proposed by Prime Minister Léon Blum have been passed by the Chamber of Deputies. At 5:00 PM, they were immediately submitted to the Senate. The Senate immediately convened at 5:15 PM and, after 15 minutes of discussion, decided to organize a special committee to review them, so that they could be submitted for discussion next Tuesday. Prime Minister Léon Blum delivered a speech in the Senate, referring to the labor strikes, saying that if there is any disruption to order, the current government will definitely stop it. The government will also take strict measures to punish anyone with suspicious intentions to interfere with the labor strikes. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Representatives of labor and management in the metallurgical industry held a meeting at the Ministry of Labor at 6:00 PM today and immediately signed an agreement, thus resolving the labor strikes in the industry. The striking workers are scheduled to return to work next Monday. This is the most important event of the day. The strikes in the wholesale and retail butcher shops in the capital were also declared over today, and they are scheduled to resume work tomorrow morning. The bakery union issued a statement saying that labor and management in the industry signed a work contract in 1929, stipulating wage ratios. In the past year, representatives of both sides have also organized a joint committee to jointly study methods of reforming the bakery industry. The relationship between the two sides is very harmonious, and the workers have never intended to strike. Currently, there are only 256,476 striking workers in the Seine region. Almost all construction workers have returned to work. The workers in the small woodworking and locksmith industries are scheduled to return to work tomorrow or next Monday. Several minor accidents occurred in the province today, and 41 workers were arrested, 39 of whom were released soon after. 736 factories in the Nord department have had their striking workers leave. The metallurgical factories in Maubeuge and the Sambre River basin are all scheduled to resume work tomorrow. The Ministry of Labor recently issued a long statement on the labor strike situation, commenting on the resumption of work throughout the country. Local authorities have also reported local situations to the Ministry of the Interior, and the tone is very optimistic. Therefore, the end of the labor strikes is not far away. (Havas, 12th)</p>

<p>Brussels: The labor strike situation in the mining areas is serious and spreading. The total number of striking workers has reached as many as 10,000, and many are occupying the mines. The reinforced police forces have driven them out of 34 locations. Labor strikes also occurred in the metallurgical factories around Liège this morning. In addition, not a single worker has returned to work in the major munitions factories in Estal. It is generally believed that there may be a general strike this afternoon. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Brussels: Since the outbreak of labor strikes in France, workers in various industries in Belgium have responded and gone on strike. In the past two days, the demands of the French workers have been met, and many have returned to work. However, in Belgium, the scope of the labor strikes is expanding. The National Executive Committee of the Trade Union Federation recently met at the Labor Club here and passed four emergency demands: 1. Adjust wages to a minimum of 32 francs (Belgian currency) per day; 2. Implement a 40-hour work week system; 3. Promulgate laws to protect workers' freedom of rights; 4. Determine annual holidays with pay. It is generally expected that the labor strike situation will become more serious next Monday. (Havas, 12th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance recently received a secret report that private smugglers are mortgaging undeclared goods to banks in order to transport them for sale. The Ministry considers the receipt of stolen goods on which taxes have not been paid to be a violation of the criminal law on stolen goods. Banks and money shops that lend money on this type of collateral are essentially receiving stolen goods on which taxes have not been paid, which is a violation of the criminal law. It is imperative to issue strict warnings. On the 13th, a special telegram was sent to all banking and money shop guilds across the country, instructing all banks and shops that when undertaking goods as collateral, if the goods are imported goods, they should provide the stack receipt and bill of lading at the original port of import, and then obtain a certificate from the customs for the import tax receipt to be provided together. For those transported from the original port of import to various places, in addition to providing the stack receipt and bill of lading, a certificate should be obtained from the local chamber of commerce or the corresponding industry guild, proving that the goods have been issued a transportation permit by the customs and are allowed to be transported and sold after being registered by the guild. If the above certificate cannot be obtained and there is suspicion of tax evasion, the bill of lading and stack receipt should be detained and reported to the local authorities or directly submitted to the Ministry for verification. If the banks and shops knowingly accept stolen goods on which taxes have not been paid as collateral, once verified, the managers of the banks and shops will be severely punished according to the criminal law on stolen goods.

<h3 id="e67">The Sino-British Boundary Demarcation Issue in Yunnan and Burma <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Nan</p>
<p>As early as 1763, Britain concluded the "Seven Years' War" and took India as its territory. In 1886 (the twelfth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty), it further seized Burma, breaching our defense barrier, thus opening the southwest gateway of our country. Therefore, the demarcation of the Yunnan-Burma boundary became a matter of utmost urgency.</p>
<p>According to records, during the reigns of Emperor Qianlong and Jiaqing of the Qing Dynasty, the Jinsha River was regarded as the natural boundary line between Yunnan and Burma. When Britain annexed Burma, Zeng Jize, our minister to Britain, still strongly advocated using the Jinsha River as the boundary during negotiations with the British Foreign Secretary Lord Clarendon. However, no boundary treaty was concluded at that time; only memoranda were exchanged and kept on file. It was not until 1894 (the twentieth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu) that Xue Fucheng, our minister to Britain, negotiated with the British Foreign Secretary Lord Rosebery on the boundary demarcation, and the Supplementary Convention between Great Britain and China relating to Burma and Tibet was concluded. This convention divided the Yunnan-Burma boundary into two sections, north and south, with the peak of Mount Hkakabo Razi at 25 degrees 35 minutes north latitude and 98 degrees 14 minutes east longitude as the center. The southern section was further divided into three segments, starting from Mount Hkakabo Razi, southwest to the Taiping River as the first segment; from the confluence of the Taiping River and the Khunlong River (i.e., the Galong River), southwest to the Shweli River as the second segment; and from the confluence of the Shweli River and the Mengmao River, southeast to the Meijiang River as the third segment. A map of the Yunnan-Burma boundary was signed as an annex. The northern section (north of 25 degrees 35 minutes north latitude) was left as an outstanding issue due to disputes over the Triangle Area (aka the "Wild Man's Mountain"). In 1896 (the twenty-second year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu), China and France concluded the Yunnan-Vietnam Treaty, ceding Mengdao (Menglian) to France. Britain believed that the two places were within the Jianghong boundary and violated Article 5 of the Supplementary Convention between Great Britain and China relating to Burma and Tibet, which stated that "China shall not cede the whole or part of Menglian and Jianghong to other countries without prior agreement between China and Britain," and demanded a new treaty. Thus, the 1897 (the twenty-third year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu) Burma Convention with Nineteen Additional Articles was concluded, which was roughly the same as the original convention, but the boundary line was pushed further east, resulting in even greater losses for our country. In 1899 (the twenty-fifth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu), China and Britain jointly appointed officials to survey the southern section of the boundary. Unexpectedly, complications arose again, and the section from the confluence of the Nampa and Namtin rivers to the point where the Namma River flows into the Nanka River could not be surveyed. At that time, our representatives Liu Wansheng and Chen Can, based on the Xue's map attached to the treaty, assigned all areas belonging to Ban Hong (Upper Hulu) to Yunnan and all areas belonging to Ban Kuang (Lower Hulu) to Burma, following the Menglin Mountain, Pachang Mountain, Gongming Mountain, to the Nanka River, using the mountain ridges and rivers as the boundary, and assigned the Mengjiao, Mengdong, and Menglian Tusi to Yunnan. However, the British side suddenly raised objections, pointing to Kongming Mountain near Lancang County as Gongming Mountain, attempting to assign the Mengga, Gongnong, Gongyong, Xiaomengnong areas belonging to Mengjiao and the Mengbo and Ximeng areas belonging to Menglian to Burma, which was obviously inconsistent with the text of the treaty. After repeated concessions and compromises between the two sides, the total boundary line involved in the negotiations was divided into five colors: yellow, blue, purple, green, and red, which is known as the Five-Color Line of the southern section. They are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>The yellow line is the initial line determined by Liu Wansheng and Chen Can according to Xue's map. It starts from the confluence of the Nampa and Namtin rivers, follows the high mountains, passes Menglin Mountain, follows the mountain ridge, passes Pachang Mountain, crosses the Dananggung River, ascends Guangkan Mountain, reaches Gongming Mountain, follows the mountain ridge to the east, crosses the Namma River, passes Shantong Yancheng, and reaches the Nanka River, follows the river to the confluence of the Nanshui River. All areas east of Menglin Mountain belonging to Ban Hong, Yongbang villages east of Pachang Mountain, Gongnong, Gongyong, Mengmao under the jurisdiction of Mengjiao, wild villages east of Gongming Mountain, wild Ka of Shantong Yancheng west of the Nanka River, and areas under the jurisdiction of Zhenbian and Menglian Tusi are assigned to Yunnan. All areas west of Menglin Mountain belonging to Ban Nong, villages of Bankuang west of Pachang Mountain, and wild Ka west of Gongming Mountain and Nanka River, such as Eleven Families of Zhaohua, Nuokan Wu, and Lower Mang Leng, are assigned to Burma.</p>
<p>The blue line is the concession line proposed by Liu Wansheng and Chen Can. After ascending Guangkan Mountain according to the yellow line, it deviates east to Nanlan Mountain, then slightly east and north to Antun Mountain, then slightly east and south to Nanwa Mountain, southeast to the Bantingshan behind Black River, turns west, follows the watershed between the Namma and Nanxiang rivers to Nongqiu Mountain, goes down along the slope to the source of the Nanka River, and follows the river to the confluence of the Nanyong River. The Xin'a and Mengga villages under the jurisdiction of Ban Hong and Mengjiao, the Xiling and Banting villages under the jurisdiction of Zhenbian and Lizhang, Ku Xing, Nanxiang, Nongqiu Mountain, Ximeng Mountain, and Guantian, Yongguang, Mannong, Lengkan, Bangbei, Yonghei, and Suxing villages on the east bank of the Nanka River all belong to Yunnan. Shaoxing, Shaoba, Upper and Lower Kunma, Shantong, Yancheng, Eleven Families of Zhaohua, and all Ka lands belong to Burma.</p>
<p>The purple line is the line shown by the ministry. After ascending Guangkan Mountain according to the blue line, it turns east to Nuoguo Mountain, south to Nanlan Mountain, deviates east to Antun Mountain, goes around to Nanwa Mountain, follows the mountain ridge, southeast to Bantingshan behind Black River, turns west to the head of the Kuxing River, follows the river to the confluence of the Nanxiang River, and then follows down to the Nanka River, where it still merges with the blue line. This means that the north and south ends completely coincide with the blue line, while the middle section advances eastward. Although Naka, Longmei, Jianmeng, Mengsuo belonging to Maoshou, Boxiang, and Heila east of the Kuxing River, and Talang and Nanbing villages south of the Nanxiang River are still within the Yunnan border, Zuoke, Banqian, and Nianhe west of the Kuxing River, and Yongting, Guojiao, Wan Mine, Banga, and Banshi villages of Ximeng Mountain all belong to Burma.</p>
<p>The green line is the line reduced by the British official Scott. Its northern section is completely the same as this color line, but when it reaches the confluence of the Kuxing River and the Nanxiang River, it goes south along the mountain ridge, passes Banshun, Fuyan, Bangbei, and Kuhei to the Nanka River, and then merges with the blue line (i.e., the purple line). In this case, Talang, Nanbing, Guantian, Fulang, Tongban, Yongguang, Mannong, Lengkan, Bangbei, and other villages all belong to the Burmese border.</p>
<p>The red line is the line drawn by the British official Scott himself. It starts from the confluence of the Nampa and Namtin rivers, follows the mountain ridge, to the north of Menglin Mountain, deviates east through Nanban, Ban Hong, Xin'a and other places, goes south along the mountain ridge to Nuoguo Mountain, turns south and east to Nanwa Mountain, then northeast, passes Manling, and then follows the Nandai Mountain through Black River Head to Banting, and then follows the watershed between the Kuxing River and the Meilu River southward, to the west of Zhenbianshubang, then southwest along the watershed between the Meilu River, and merges with the green line. In this way, Ban Hong, Xin'a, Mengga, Gongnong, Xiaomengnong, Manling and other places in the north, and Naka, Yuemei, Fameng, Heila, Maoshou, Mengsuo, Boxiang and other places in the middle are all assigned to the Burmese border.</p>
<p>In the above-mentioned boundary demarcation situation, the northern section (north of Mount Hkakabo Razi) has become an outstanding issue, and the southern section (south of Mount Hkakabo Razi) has not been determined due to different opinions on the boundary line. Moreover, the British side used the excuse that the map used by our side was not the original map signed by the two ministers Xue and Rosebery, and insisted on using the red line to determine the boundary, so the negotiations failed to produce results, and the Sino-British-French demarcation of the Yunnan-Burma boundary was suspended, and has not been resolved for forty years. Since the founding of the Republic of China, the country has been plagued by many problems, and the border issues have not been given attention. The imperceptible encroachment by the British, such as secretly shifting boundary markers and cultivating land across the border, has been heard from time to time. Since they arbitrarily invade, they do not value the boundary, so there is no need to urgently determine it. However, their ambition to encroach eastward has never been slightly restrained due to the undetermined boundary. Moreover, the Triangle Area in the northern section is close to the source of the Yangtze River, which is a shortcut to open up the Yangtze River; the Ban Hong in the southern section has extremely many minerals and is a place rich in resources, which the British have coveted day and night. The Pianma Incident and the Jiangxinpo Incident in the twenty-third year were manifestations of their ambition to use the undetermined boundary in the northern section to extend their power to Sichuan and Kangding, and to attempt to directly descend into the Yangtze River basin. The Banfan Incident of the same year was an activity within the undetermined boundary in the southern section, with the aim of seizing mining rights.</p>
<p>Since our southwestern border has been repeatedly nibbled away, the government has reiterated its previous proposal and proposed to send officials to survey the boundary. Thus, the Sino-British Joint Committee for the Survey of the Yunnan-Burma Boundary was established in April of the twenty-fourth year, composed of two members each from China and Britain, and one neutral member selected by the chairman of the Council of the League of Nations. Since the establishment of the committee, a year has passed. The survey work has not been long before it was temporarily suspended due to the severe miasma on the Yunnan border, which made it impossible to survey. Unfortunately, at this time of prolonged indecision, on February 21 of this year, more than 200 British soldiers suddenly entered the Yunnan border, occupied the Jingmao area belonging to Lancang County, and set up various military projects. Their intention was to create a "fait accompli" as an excuse to encroach during the boundary survey. However, the results of the thorough investigation by the boundary survey committee stated that it was actually a misunderstanding by the British survey team, and the committee members returning to Beijing also stated in their talks that the boundary survey process was quite smooth. However, although we dare not be certain what serious significance the British intrusion into Jingmao has, it can be asserted that there are still many thorns in the future of the boundary affairs.</p>
<p>Considering the five-color boundary lines in the disputed southern section, even according to the yellow line, the concessions have been much greater than the memorandum made by Minister Zeng, who advocated using the Jinsha River as the natural boundary after Britain's conquest of Burma in 1886. Moreover, based on the Supplementary Convention between Great Britain and China relating to Burma and Tibet of 1894 and the Burma Convention with Nineteen Additional Articles of 1897, there is no reason to make further concessions. We observe that the numerous complications in the repeated boundary surveys and the long-term indecision clearly indicate where the responsibility lies. Therefore, whether the Sino-British-French Yunnan-Burma boundary demarcation can proceed smoothly in the future depends on whether the British have sincerity and whether they can base it on a fair spirit and determine a reasonable boundary line based on history and geography.</p>

<p>Lectures on Venereal Diseases</p>
<p>— Report by Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Expert</p>
<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Corner of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road, Shanghai (Consultation) 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, Closed on Sundays</p>
<p>The Pathology and Treatment of Spermatorrhea</p>
<p>This condition is often caused by weak constitution and masturbation. Patients develop a habit of involuntary ejaculation. The seminal vesicle becomes lax, and the reproductive glands also decline. The treatment prioritizes strengthening the essence. "Hymettus Essence Consolidating Tablets" are the primary remedy. Nourishment should not be neglected. "Reproductive Essence" is the most effective, utilizing its strong nourishing power to directly reach the reproductive glands. In early spring, I repeatedly used it to cure Mr. Tang and Mr. Zheng's spermatorrhea and nocturnal emission, insomnia, and forgetfulness. Last month, I used it to cure Mr. Wei and Mr. Wu's spermatorrhea during bowel movements, pale and emaciated appearance, and other symptoms, and all achieved satisfactory special effects. The course of treatment did not exceed one month.</p>
<p>Premature Ejaculation, Sexual Weakness - Electricity and Medicine Combined</p>
<p>There are many patients with sexual neurasthenia. They are caused by the destruction of masturbation and excessive sexual activity. There are also those caused by the destruction of venereal diseases. The source of the disease lies in the lack of reproductive gland hormone and the decline of reproductive glands. Targeted medication, "Reproductive Essence" is the most effective. For example, Mr. Zhang of the factory, I used it to relieve his above-mentioned chronic diseases, supplemented by electrotherapy. The course of treatment was only about three weeks.</p>
<p>Kidney Deficiency, Backache, Tremors, Back Pain</p>
<p>The nervous system is densely distributed throughout the body and relies entirely on the nutrition of reproductive gland hormone. If reproductive gland hormone is deficient or abnormal, neurasthenia occurs, and various symptoms arise. Backache and back pain are the earliest signs. Targeted medication leads to the fastest treatment. Last month, Mr. Xu from Jiujiang came and complained of symptoms such as kidney deficiency, backache, tremors, and back pain. I immediately prescribed "Reproductive Essence" for him to take internally. In less than three weeks, he reported complete recovery and happily thanked me before leaving.</p>
<p>Stomach Problems, Bone Pain - The Cause of Pain Must Be Treated</p>
<p>Pain is a warning symptom that appears externally. The best solution is to treat the cause of the pain. Simply stopping the pain is nothing more than covering it up, making people lose vigilance, and making the disease more severe. For example, last month, Mr. Shao from Changzhou came and complained of long-term stomach pain and bone pain, numbness in the limbs, and other symptoms. Repeated medications were ineffective. I instructed him to go to the Wuzhou Pharmacy to purchase "Stomach Pain Relief" and Strong's "Bone Pain Tablets" to treat the cause of his pain, and to use "Stomach Nourishing Essence" to nourish his weak stomach, and to use "Reproductive Essence" to regulate his diseased body. After quickly taking four or five boxes, all symptoms disappeared. He regained the strength and health that he had never had before, as if he had been reborn.</p>
<p>Irregular Menstruation, Persistent Leukorrhea</p>
<p>Women are constrained by their environment. Once they have a hidden illness, they often keep it secret. It is inconvenient to seek medical attention, and there is no way to take medicine. Physical and mental suffering cannot be described. Last winter, Mrs. Yan was introduced by a relative, Ms. So-and-so, to seek medical attention. She complained of the suffering of irregular menstruation and leukorrhea turning yellow. I instructed her to purchase "Female Reproductive Essence" for internal use and "Leukorrhea Relief Essence" for external use from the Taihe Pharmacy, and to use both internally and externally. Within a month, she recovered. Not only were her breasts plump, but she also regained the youthful beauty of her younger years. Last month, she introduced her second sister to treat amenorrhea and infertility. I learned that she was already four or five months pregnant.</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea, Insomnia, Premature Aging</p>
<p>Essence is the most precious treasure of the human body. The nourishment of brain blood and the whole body depends on it. If essence is thin and depleted, various symptoms of weakness will arise. Therefore, spermatorrhea patients often complain of weak brain, insomnia, blood depletion, pale complexion, emaciation, premature aging and other symptoms. For example, last month, Mr. Ni and Mr. Huang made similar complaints. I instructed them to go to the Sino-British Pharmacy to purchase "Hymettus Essence Consolidating Tablets" to treat their spermatorrhea and to take "Reproductive Essence" to nourish their essence, blood, brain marrow, and nerves. They immediately saw prosperity, and after taking half a dozen doses, they returned to the youthful state they should have had in their youth.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Statistics on Smuggled Goods Arriving in Jinan in April and May <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The total value of the goods is approximately 600,000 yuan. Customs losses exceed one million yuan. Jinan's commerce is greatly affected.</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: A large number of smuggled goods from a certain country have arrived in Jinan. Taking the goods arriving in Jinan from Tianjin from June 1st to 11th as an example, there are approximately 300 to 400 pieces of cigarette paper, more than 320 pieces of rayon, and more than 120 tons and 9 bags of white sugar, with a total value of approximately 230,000 yuan. Customs losses are also estimated at 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. As for the quantity of smuggled goods in April and May, according to the statistics of the freight documents of the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways, a large number of rayon, cigarette paper, and white sugar arrived in Jinan. The number of rayon transported along the Jiaoji Railway to Zhoucun is particularly alarming. Jinan's commerce has been greatly affected, and the domestic silk market has been particularly hit.

In addition, from May 1st to 31st, there were 4,420 tons of white sugar transported from Tianjin to Jinan.</p>
<p>Customs Losses</p>
<p>The total of smuggled rayon from Tianjin and Jiaoji Railways in April and May is 17,536 pieces. The average weight of each piece is approximately 6 kilograms, totaling 105,216 kilograms. The value of each piece is approximately 170 yuan, with a total value of 2,981,112 yuan. There are 1,414 pieces of cigarette paper, with each piece weighing approximately 160 kilograms, totaling 226,240 kilograms. The value of each piece is 160 yuan, estimated at a total value of 226,240 yuan. The total value of the above two items is 524,352 yuan. The customs and all additional taxes are approximately one times the total value, so the customs losses in the past two months should be more than one million yuan. The over 4,000 tons of untaxed white sugar are not included. The numbers in this one area are already so large, and if other areas are included, the numbers would be even more shocking. (11th)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Construction of the Guang-Shan Railway <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways has agreed to allocate construction funds, but whether it will be state-run or province-run is yet to be decided.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Transportation between Guangzhou and Shantou has long relied on maritime routes. Since the completion of the provincial highway main lines, transportation between Guangzhou and Shantou can be done by automobile. However, the provincial government considers Shantou an important commercial port in the Dongjiang region, and products from various counties in the Dongjiang region can be exported through Shantou. Therefore, there is an urgent need to build the Guang-Shan Railway to connect with the Yue-Han Railway, so as to gradually implement the Premier's southwest railway network plan. Therefore, the provincial government instructed the Yue-Han Railway South Section Bureau last year to send technicians to survey the Guang-Shan railway line. The survey has been completed. Later, due to the lack of construction funds, it was initially planned to be jointly supervised by the government and merchants, but it did not materialize due to various reasons. When Minister of Railways Zhang Jia'ao came to the south, Provincial Chairman Lin Yunkai brought up the issue of building the Guang-Shan Railway for discussion and requested that the Ministry of Railways allocate funds for construction. The Ministry of Railways then proposed that the construction of the Guang-Shan Railway would require tens of millions of dollars, which would be allocated from the construction public debt funds or borrowed from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee as construction funds. According to news from the provincial government yesterday, the provincial government has decided to actively prepare for the construction of the Guang-Shan Railway in order to connect transportation in various counties in the Dongjiang region. At the same time, the provincial government has received a reply from the Ministry of Railways stating that the construction funds for the Guang-Shan Railway have been approved. The Ministry of Railways will send personnel to the south to discuss the construction plan with the provincial government. After the Ministry of Railways' technical director arrives in the south, preparations will begin. As for the future management of the Guang-Shan Railway, whether it will be state-run or province-run, it is still to be decided through consultation. Recently, Provincial Chairman Lin sent a telegram to Li Xiangen, director of the Yue-Han Railway South Section Bureau, to consult with Minister Zhang in Beijing as soon as possible regarding the Guang-Shan Railway's progress.</p>
<h3 id="e72">General Situation of Land Use in Beijing <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The total area is approximately 69,871 mu. In the future, land in Beijing will become more uniform and orderly.</p>
<p>Nanjing Communication: The Nanjing Municipal Government has been very active in organizing land administration in recent years, and the results are excellent. The following is a record of the general situation of land use:</p>
<p>Determining the Political District</p>
<p>The Central Political District is the construction area for central government offices. The Capital Construction Committee designed and formulated drawings to delineate the land along the north and south sides of Zhongshan Road within Zhongshan Gate in the old imperial city area, with an area of more than 4,000 mu. Later, due to the increase in the population of Beijing and the increasing lack of housing, the Beijing Municipal Government delineated a portion of the south side, about 2,500 mu, as a residential area, which was contracted by the people for construction. The land price was set at six yuan per square meter, and an additional construction fee of twenty yuan per square meter was charged. Now the entire plan has been finalized, and it can be carried out according to the plan after the collection procedures are completed.</p>
<p>Newly Developed Residential Area</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the capital in Beijing, the population has increased dramatically. The original housing supply cannot meet the demand, and most of it is located in the south of the city, stretching for more than ten miles from Xiaguan to Gulou. Government offices are lined up, and housing is scarce, resulting in rising house prices and rents. The citizens feel extremely distressed about the housing problem. The Beijing Municipal Government, in view of this, planned in June of the 19th year to collect more than 2,000 mu of land in the Dafang Lane, Lao Caishi, and Gulin Temple areas in the north of the city to develop a new residential area, which is divided into four districts. The first district has an area of 417.0615 mu. After deducting 27.7479 mu for public land, all the residential land of 389.8536 mu is divided into 290 lots. The land price is set at eight yuan per square meter, and an additional construction fee of twenty yuan is charged. It was completely released in the 23rd year. Public construction and housing projects in the district have now been largely completed. The second and third districts have not been organized because the location is relatively remote. The fourth district has an area of 418.0216 mu. After deducting 20.6551 mu for public land, all the residential land of 397.3665 mu is divided into 295 lots. It was completely released in the 24th year. Various construction projects in the district have now begun. In addition to developing new residential areas, the Beijing Municipal Government also plans to develop low-cost housing areas for the convenience of citizens. First, three places in the city, including Wudingmen, Gonghoushan, and Hepingmen, were acquired, with a total area of more than 34 mu, and low-cost housing was built for citizens to rent. It was completed in the 24th year and began to be rented out. Now, land is still being acquired in six places, including Mofan Road, Hongmiao, Guangdong Villa, Mint Factory, Laohutou, and Xinghuacun, with a total area of more than 440 mu. They are all being developed as low-cost housing areas and have now been completely acquired.</p>
<p>Land Re-planning</p>
<p>The abandoned land on both sides of the newly built roads in Beijing and the remaining land acquired due to road construction, which do not meet the prescribed construction standards, are all re-planned by the Beijing Municipal Government and reorganized before the people can contract for construction. The Zhongshan East Road, Daxing Palace, Taiping Road, and Menlian Bridge sections have been reorganized in accordance with this re-planning plan. The following is a classified comparison table of the land acquisition area in Nanjing:</p>
<p>In addition to the area listed in the table on the right, there are also rural areas and Pukou, etc., with a total urban area of 69,871 mu (city system).</p>
<h3 id="e73">Fire Arson Plot Suspected Case in Fuzhou <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Insurance premium of more than 240,000 yuan. Fang Meizhen was detained pending trial.</p>
<p>Fuzhou Communication: A sensational suspected arson plot case has recently occurred in Minyuan, Fuzhou. The Chadao area of ​​Cangxiazhou in Nantai is a place where ships from the upper reaches of the Minjiang River gather. There is an Anping warehouse on the riverbank, which is specially rented to people for storing tea, fragrant mushrooms, dried bamboo shoots, and groceries transported from various counties in northern Fujian. The warehouse owner is Fang Meizhen, who subleased it from Southeast Bank. At 2:30 in the morning on June 1, a fire alarm suddenly occurred. All the fire brigades in the city rushed to rescue. By 3:00, the fire was extinguished. The warehouse owner, Fang Meizhen, went to the Minhou Local Procuratorate at about 10:00 am that morning to file a case. After a brief interrogation, he was released on bail. Afterwards, it was found that the warehouse's cargo owners held a huge amount of cargo fire insurance totaling 241,000 yuan, including 65,000 yuan from Siming Company, 20,000 yuan from Taishan Company, 21,000 yuan from Yongfeng Company, 16,000 yuan from Chanson Foreign Company, 24,000 yuan from Taikoo Company, 10,000 yuan from Sun Company, 39,000 yuan from Seaborne Company, 6,000 yuan from Yuchang Company, 10,000 yuan from China Company for building insurance, 23,000 yuan from Yangtze River Company, and 7,000 yuan from Baozhong Company. The amount of loss broke the record of fire insurance compensation in Fuzhou. Each company suspected that its behavior was suspicious, so it telegraphed Shanghai Yizhong, Sanyi, Lu Yishi Moore, and San Justice Line, Ge Jichen, Li Situn, Yin Maozhi, and Laude to come to Fujian by plane on the 2nd for inspection. The Minhou Local Procuratorate also went to the scene for inspection on the 5th by Prosecutor Deng Yinan. According to the warehouse owner, Fang Meizhen, in the case filing, the cause of the fire was caused by the neighboring Longcheng Tea House setting off firecrackers for a funeral. Prosecutor Deng, in order to conduct a careful investigation, opened a temporary investigation court in Longcheng Tea House and summoned He, a cohabitant, who stated that the deceased was not yet 30 years old on the day of the funeral. According to Fujian customs, firecrackers could not be set off, so no firecrackers were set off when the coffin was carried out. However, when returning to Yuyu, a string of Bai Zi cannons worth thirteen copper coins was set off by the river in Chadao to invite auspiciousness. After investigating, there were more than ten houses and two or three high walls between the river in Chadao and the warehouse. After the interrogation, the prosecutor personally went to the river for inspection and drew a picture for record. The next day, Prosecutor Deng also summoned Lu Yishi Moore and Sanyi to inquire about the results of the inspection for reference. The warehouse owner, Fang Meizhen, was allowed to be released on bail for 3,000 yuan. Currently, due to lack of bail, he is still in custody. According to people in the insurance industry, all the Chinese and foreign head offices are paying close attention to the fire insurance claim of this warehouse. They will file charges against all parties involved in accordance with the law to find out the truth and curb the evil trend of fire insurance claims. (June 10)</p>

<p>Urge the completion of the highway</p>
<p>Shen Shixiao, a technician previously sent by the Construction Department to Songjiang to inspect the highway, heard that Shen had inspected various counties in the third district. In addition to the completed highways, he believed that the Songjiang-Jinshan Line and Fengjing-Jinshan Line were particularly urgent, and the Jiading-Huangdu Line, Zhaoxiang-Sheshan Line, and Songjiang-Shanghai Line were secondary and should be urged to be built. After learning the situation, the Construction Department ordered the administrative inspector and commissioner to urge them separately. It is reported that the Songjin and Fengjin lines require about 90,000 yuan, and the two counties are specially ordered to try to attract investment from merchants for construction.</p>

<p>Telegram requesting reduction of agricultural fees</p>
<p>The county's industrial special funds are listed at more than 22,800 yuan per year. The business handling requires 16,720 yuan, leaving only about 6,000 yuan, but the province orders the payment of more than 10,000 yuan each year, and there is always a risk of insufficient funds. Now that the provincial government is aware of this, it will re-determine the agricultural fees to be paid by each county. Some will be completely exempt from payment, and some will be reduced. However, this county still needs to report and pay the amount as scheduled. The agencies believe that they are uniquely and unfairly treated and that the facts are difficult, so they telegraphed the province on the 12th to request a reduction in order to be fair and avoid empty expenditures.</p>
<p>Le'an Township Farmers Robbed</p>
<p>The home of Zhang Zhaorong, a farmer in Le'an Township, First District, was suddenly visited by more than ten bandits at about 12:00 pm on the 11th. They were armed and broke into the room from the roof. Zhang Zhaorong and his wife were awakened from their dreams and were immediately caught by the bandits. They were tied to the pillars with lead wire and beaten. They were robbed of more than 100 yuan in banknotes and a lot of clothes and jewelry.</p>

<p>Cocoon firms suppress cocoon prices</p>
<p>The sericulturists in Lanqiao and other places here have all harvested their cocoons and are waiting for a good price to sell. Unexpectedly, recently, Shaochang Cocoon Firm in the area deliberately suppressed the cocoon price, which is less than 30 yuan per dan, which is too different from the current Wuxi market price. Moreover, the co-breeding cocoon households improved by the guidance station are no different from ordinary cocoons. As a result, many cocoon households are watching and unwilling to sell. Now the cocoon firm is asking the township head to find a way to reward the co-breeding households with 600 yuan, which will be distributed by the township head. As for the cocoon price, it is still the same as ordinary cocoons. Currently, the breeding households add six yuan per dan for the co-breeding households of previous years and disagree with the method proposed by the cocoon firm. They have telegraphed the director of the guidance station to request a solution from the Construction Department.</p>

<p>Armed assistance to collect field rent</p>
<p>Farmers in Xietang Chefang and other townships in Wuxian County have been making trouble over rent, and in the past month, incidents of gathering crowds to cause trouble, resisting officials and police, destroying township offices, and demolishing Baojia houses have occurred one after another, no less than a dozen times. County Magistrate Deng believes that although disputes have occurred repeatedly, he cannot give up eating because of choking, and the issue of urging rent should still be worked hard. On the morning of the 13th, he specially sent Zhang Yijun, a member of the Tenth District Handling Field Rent Disputes, and Li Zilian from the Ninth District to go to Lianmu Jin Temple and other townships in Xietang Township together with the district chiefs and primary school principals to persuade them to pay rent and check the rental conditions. At the same time, he sent the First Squadron of the Security Team to the township to be directed by the committee members to assist in the collection of rent and prevent everything to be thorough. According to those familiar with the field rent situation, the field rent problem in various townships in Wuxian County is very complicated. Strictly chasing the rent rice is the current palliative measure, not the fundamental solution. As for the fundamental solution, it is necessary to improve rural customs, strictly prohibit rural gambling, and ban the transfer of rent. Most of the farmers are lazy by nature. If they need fertilizer to cut grass, etc., they will order Jiangbei migrants to handle it on their behalf, spending money regardless of the cost. Moreover, there are gambling tables in the small tea houses in the countryside, which are shocking to the eye. Farmers often entrust farming to others and spend their good time in the small tea houses from morning to night. The government cannot ban it because its whip is too long. As for the transfer of field rent, this kind of bad habit that harms farmers should be strictly prohibited. If A has a rental field book and transfers it to B, and B transfers it to C, A and B will profit from it (called transfer fee). May I ask who is working hard to cultivate the field all year round, but after the autumn harvest, they have to bear the rent of the warehouse and pay the transfer fee to A and B who do not work for nothing. A and B are all powerful people in the countryside, so the villagers fear them like tigers and dare not resist. Such heavy exploitation is really too much for the poor farmers to bear, so various unfortunate events occur. However, as a result of the government's efforts to educate them over the years, the villagers no longer have the word "resist rent" in their mouths. The current situation is that although some people are deliberately making trouble, most of it is an economic problem.</p>

<p>Cocoon firms stop weighing uniformly</p>
<p>All cocoon firms in the four townships stopped weighing uniformly on the 12th. The silkworm affairs in various townships in Liyang County were very prosperous this year. The total harvest of the whole county is estimated to be above 85%. The silk factories in the county jointly went to Liyang to purchase fresh cocoons. All the cocoon receiving workers set off from Wuxi on the 1st of this month. They then organized a joint cocoon receiving office in Liyang, which was responsible for the management of 40 to 50 large and small cocoon firms. The cocoon quality was still considered excellent, and the cocoon price was bullish at 24 or 25 yuan. The tearing price was 30 yuan, and it also ended uniformly on the 12th. However, Jiangyin and Danyang counties need to extend the weighing for three or four days because the shipments have been surging recently.</p>

<p>The Wu Yi County government stated that the water situation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has recently surged, and the Huai River may also surge. It also promulgated the Jiangsu Province flood prevention measures, and ordered the fourth and second district chiefs of the county to follow them. In addition to mobilizing local people to cultivate and strengthen the embankments, on the 13th, it specially sent technician Gu Weiying to supervise the report.</p>

<p>Civil servants accused of extortion</p>
<p>Shen Qingcheng, a technician from the Third Technology Section of the County Government, was accused of extorting more than 80 yuan of public funds from Zhu Wenjing, the district chief of the Eighth District, when he was checking and accepting the excavation of ditch ponds in various townships in the Eighth District. Yin Pengfei and Zhao Zicai, the chiefs of Huayu Zhang Village, reported to the County Government. The County Magistrate personally opened a court for interrogation. Shen Qingcheng and others were suspected of encroaching on public funds and were ordered to suspend their duties and handed over to the court for trial.</p>
<p>Silkworm farmers reluctantly sell goods</p>
<p>The cocoon firms in various townships in the county have been weighing for several days, and the goods are still coming in large quantities. However, the improved variety of cocoons is only sold for 30 yuan per dan, and the native variety is sold for more than 20 yuan, which is five or six yuan less than the cocoon price in neighboring counties. Therefore, the general silkworm farmers reluctantly sell the goods and complain endlessly. It is said that they will jointly negotiate with the silk merchants who receive goods in Danyang, Shanghai and Wuxi and ask them to increase the price to reconcile the silkworm farmers.</p>

<p>Chen has telegraphed his troops to stop advancing and will send personnel to Beijing to pay respects to the authorities.</p>
<p>Central News Agency said that Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, left Beijing by night train at 11:00 pm the night before. Due to train delays, he did not arrive at Zhenru until 8:40 am yesterday morning. He went straight back to his private residence on West Avis Road to rest. At noon, he went to the Central Bank to handle important official business and met with Chen Xing, Vice President of the Central Bank, and Yang Ge, Advisor to the Ministry of Finance, and many others. A reporter from the Central News Agency went to the Central Bank yesterday to inquire about the current situation. According to him, the Central Government has decided to focus on the overall situation and deal with the changes in Guangdong and Guangxi with leniency. It hopes that the troops in Guangdong and Guangxi will immediately withdraw to their original defenses and hopes that comrades in Guangdong and Guangxi will come to Beijing to attend the Second Plenary Session. If there are any opinions, they can be discussed, and everything can be resolved. According to news I have obtained, Chen Bonan has telegraphed his troops to stop advancing and will send a responsible representative to Beijing to pay respects to and consult with the Central Authorities. As for the report that the Central Government will send personnel to the south, I am busy with my duties and have no intention of going to the south at present. I have not heard of the rumors that Ye Chucang, Wang Chonghui, and others will go to the south. He then talked about the source of smuggled goods, which should be prevented and cracked down on. The sales channels of smuggled goods are also very important. He hoped that merchants and people across the country would uphold their patriotic enthusiasm and investigate the source of goods they buy. If they are smuggled goods, they should not buy them. If smuggled goods have no sales market, those who operate smuggled goods will naturally disappear. Moreover, the government has regulations for those who report smuggled goods, and they will be rewarded with 50%. In this way, our patriotic merchants and people can express their patriotic hearts and also benefit from a 50% bonus. The society may not know about this, and I hope the newspapers will publicize it so that everyone knows about it. With the cooperation of the government and the people, the smuggling problem can be fundamentally resolved.</p>

Interest was charged at 8% per week from the date of payment for the purchase of materials, totaling 161,574 pounds, 13 shillings, and 2 pence. Since the Ministry of Railways supervised the two railway bureaus to deposit special reserve funds from the business revenue to repay the debts on a monthly basis and allocated them to the HSBC Bank to transfer to the Sino-British Bank in London for repayment, the advance payment has been fully repaid as of recently. Now the Railway Bureau has submitted a request to the Ministry of Railways to notify the Sino-British Bank to cancel the advance payment contract.</p>

<p>The Zhushao section of the project is completed and the bond funds have been fully disbursed.</p>
<p>Shin Shi News Agency said that in order to complete the Yue-Han Railway, the Ministry of Railways, together with the Ministry of Finance, issued the 6% British Boxer Indemnity Bond in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. According to the regulations of the bond, a Bond Management Committee should be established. The three ministries of Railways, Finance and Audit, and the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Directors mutually sent representatives to organize and establish the committee to handle the management and disbursement of the bond funds. It has been nearly two years since then, and a total of 1.35 million pounds of bond funds have been received successively, which have been allocated for the construction of the Zhushao section of the Yue-Han Railway. Now the construction project of the Zhushao section has been largely completed, and it has been decided to officially open to traffic on September 1. The bond funds managed by the committee have also been fully disbursed one after another. According to Article 8 of the committee's organizational regulations, "It shall be abolished on the date when the bond funds are fully disbursed," it should be announced immediately. The committee has followed the regulations to handle the liquidation and reported to the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance has also designated the receiving agencies and taken over all documents, archives, official seals, account books, etc.</p>

The administrative organs of various provinces are assisting in anti-smuggling. There is a record of a circular from the Executive Yuan. Now, due to the increasingly serious smuggling situation mentioned above, we specially request you to instruct your subordinate agencies to cooperate wholeheartedly and assist in the investigation and arrest.

<h3 id="e95">Completing the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, Issuing 6% English Gold Bonds <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>A Total of One Million and One Hundred Thousand Pounds Sterling at 6% Annual Interest, Underwritten by Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and HSBC</p>
<p>In order to complete the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, the Ministry of Railways submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan for approval and signed a loan contract with a consortium formed by the British Chinese Corporation and the China Construction Bank on May 8th of this year. The loan amounts to one million and one hundred thousand pounds sterling, and bonds are issued, underwritten by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and HSBC. A fund custody committee is established. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Issuing Bonds: The total amount of bonds is one million and one hundred thousand pounds sterling. The repayment period is from 1941 to 1960. The bonds are underwritten by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and HSBC at a rate of 94, that is, each bond with a face value of one hundred pounds sterling will actually receive ninety-four pounds sterling. The interest rate is six percent per annum, with principal and interest repaid on June 15th and December 15th each year. The first interest payment will be made on December 15th of this year. Holders of the loan's principal and interest who are paid in Shanghai may request the exchange rate for immediate English gold drafts payable in London, in exchange for Chinese legal tender. The bonds are divided into two types: fifty pounds and one hundred pounds.</p>
<p>Use and Guarantee: In order to repay the remaining balance of the 1908 Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway loan and to meet the funding needs for the uncompleted sections of the railway, the Ministry of Railways signed a contract with the above-mentioned consortium on November 29th of the 23rd year of the Republic of China to raise a loan of sixteen million yuan in national currency. However, due to financial and market conditions at the time, the funds were not raised. The consortium advanced funds twice on behalf of the Ministry of Railways in May of the 24th year of the Republic of China, one to repay the remaining balance of the above-mentioned 1908 loan, and the other to provide funds for the commencement of the Qiantang River Bridge. Now, in order to complete the original loan plan of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, a new contract for this loan of one million and one hundred thousand pounds sterling was re-signed on May 8th of the 25th year of the Republic of China, directly by the National Government, and the income of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway (including 70% of the toll revenue from the railway and highway traffic on the Qiantang River Bridge, with the remaining 30% belonging to the Zhejiang Provincial Government) was designated as the first guarantee, and the funds that can be designated by the Ministry of Railways as the second guarantee. The above-mentioned income of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has not been pledged for any loan and can be used exclusively for the repayment of the principal and interest of this loan. The loan is used exclusively for (1) repaying the above-mentioned two advances, (2) repaying the outstanding payments owed to the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Railway Company since the 3rd year of the Republic of China, (3) completing the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway and the Qiantang River Bridge, (4) constructing the Nanxingqiao branch line, and (5) paying for the price of vehicles ordered through the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees. The term is 25 years, starting from the 29th year of the Republic of China, with principal repaid by lottery. Each lottery shall be held in Shanghai three months before each repayment. However, the National Government may, at any time, according to the following methods, notify the consortium in writing six months in advance to repay in advance. From ten years after the loan is established to the sixteenth year, the bonds will be redeemed at face value plus 2.5% (that is, each bond with a face value of one hundred pounds sterling will be redeemed at one hundred and two pounds and ten shillings sterling). After the sixteenth year, the bonds may be redeemed at the face value of the bonds.</p>
<p>Four Banks Underwrite: The underwriting methods of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and HSBC are (1) Application: Applicants should fill out an application form, and the application amount should be in units of fifty pounds sterling. (2) Payment: The amount to be raised should be paid in full once by London telegraphic transfer (telegraphic fees are borne by the bank). (3) Refund: If the amount raised is insufficient to allocate the excess, the bank will refund all or part of the bond funds that have been paid. (4) Subscription Certificate: Applicants should exchange the bond notification for an unregistered subscription certificate from the bank. When the bonds are ready, the prospectus, recruitment prospectus, and application form can be obtained from the above-mentioned banks, or from the British Chinese Corporation at 27 Bund, Shanghai, and the China Construction Bank at 181 Jiangxi Road. (6) Application Forms: Registration has already begun and will be closed on or before June 17th. After the recruitment registration began, the number of people going to the four underwriting banks and the two British-Chinese Construction Banks to obtain stamps and application forms was very enthusiastic yesterday. As soon as the full amount is reached, the registration will be closed immediately. The majority of applicants are British people residing in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Fund Committee: The Custody Fund Committee. The Ministry of Railways appointed five committee members. In addition to Minister Zhang Gongquan, who served as a committee member and chairman, Song Ziliang, general manager of the China Construction Bank, Davidson, the resident representative of the British Chinese Corporation in Shanghai, represented the consortium, and Sa Fuzun and Lin Zhaotang represented the Ministry of Railways, with full supervisory powers. In addition, foreign committee members were invited to participate in the joint management system implemented by the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, and the employment of a British Chief Accountant and a British Chief Engineer was maintained. The railway income is deposited monthly in the HSBC and the Bank of China as a fund for repaying the principal and interest in English gold. The British Chinese Corporation and the China Construction Bank have been appointed as the special agents for the bondholders. If there is a surplus in the railway income, it should be deposited in the bank as a special deposit. The amount of this deposit should be sufficient to cover the principal and interest payable on this loan for two years. According to the statistics published by the railway, the average annual net profit of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway in the past five years was 1,518,551 yuan and 8551 yuan in national currency. In particular, the net profit in the 20th year of the Republic of China reached a record high of 2 million yuan in national currency. Although the situation in the 23rd and 24th years of the Republic of China was slightly worse, the net profit still reached 1,344,928 yuan in national currency. Therefore, after the establishment of this loan, the annual interest payment for the first five years, calculated at an exchange rate of one shilling, two pence, and three-eighths, is 1,100,1913 yuan and 03 yuan in national currency. There is still a sufficient surplus in annual income that can be used as a special deposit. It is expected that after the completion of the section from Zhakou to Baiguan (including the Qiantang River Bridge), the operating income should increase significantly. On the one hand, the Fund Management Committee of this loan, for the benefit of protecting bondholders, shall exercise its supervisory powers and assist the railway operation in terms of economy and savings in expenses as much as possible. After the completion of the railway, the annual income can be increased by at least 720,000 yuan in national currency. In addition, it is estimated that the Qiantang River Bridge will generate 300,000 yuan in national currency per year, for a total increase of 1,020,000 yuan in national currency per year. The consortium also intends to apply to the London Stock Exchange for permission to officially open the bonds of this loan on the Exchange to facilitate circulation. If members of the Shanghai Stock Exchange apply for subscriptions, they should be given 2.5 per thousand of the amount of bonds allocated as commission.</p>
<p>Notify Villagers: If smuggled goods are discovered, they should be reported to the Customs or local military police for investigation and arrest at any time. After the smuggled goods are seized, the Customs will deal with them strictly and reward them generously in accordance with the regulations to encourage them. At this time of turmoil and shared destiny, we sincerely hope that you will assist us sincerely and work together to overcome difficulties. We look forward to receiving your telegrams. "We have endless things to say," etc. Upon receipt of this, we found that customs duties are a major source of national revenue and are extremely important.

Income from entertainment venues is being transferred to donations, and major theaters, amusement parks, and dance halls are holding events one after another. Ms. Deng Lili, the manager of the Dalu Dance Hall on Ningbo Road, due to the rainy weather last Sunday, did not have much income, so she specially scheduled a joint entertainment event for all employees of the hall on the 14th, and the income will also be transferred to help purchase aircraft for birthday greetings. In addition to inviting famous Shanghai dance stars to participate in the dance, the hall also invited movie stars Yan Yuexian, Li Minghui, the four Liang sisters, Dian Meifeng, Shao Feifei, and Wang Xiuling to sing. In addition, the Aircraft Purchase Commemorative Meeting received 407 yuan and 87 cents from donations collected by primary schools under the Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Education Department, 300 yuan from the Cloth Industry Guild, and 618 yuan from the spring concert held by the National Conservatory of Music at the New Asia Hotel on June 1st.

<p>Telegram from the Municipal Party Headquarters' Executive and Supervisory Committee: (Telegram One) To esteemed Guangzhou Committee Member Chen Bonan: With aggressive neighbors and deepening national crisis, our comrades in Guangdong and Guangxi are committed to resisting the enemy. All compatriots share this sentiment. However, the most crucial task for national salvation is to unite national strength. Anti-enemy strategies must be consistent. The recent sudden entry of Guangdong and Guangxi troops into Hunan has not achieved the effect of resisting the enemy but has instead initiated the disaster of division. Resisting the enemy leads to inviting insult, and saving the nation ends up hastening its demise. This is surely not what you intended. The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee is scheduled to convene soon. Salvation and survival will be decided upon. If comrades in Guangdong and Guangxi have sound plans to resist the enemy, there will be ample opportunity to present them. You hold great sway in Guangdong and Guangxi; your words carry weight. If you can pull back from the brink and mediate the overall situation, Li Bai and other leaders will surely restrain their troops and follow, stopping internal strife to resist external aggression, and concentrating all efforts to save the nation from danger. We urgently beseech you to prioritize national interests. The Shanghai Special Municipal Executive and Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. [Seal] (Telegram Two) To esteemed Nanhai Committee Member Li Delin, Bai Jiansheng: With aggressive neighbors and deepening national crisis, our comrades in Guangdong and Guangxi are committed to resisting the enemy.

<p>Telegram from the Security Party Headquarters: (Telegram One) To esteemed Guangzhou Committee Member Chen Bonan, Li Zongren, Nanning Committee Member Bai Jiansheng: Recent reports indicate that the Guangdong troops are advocating resistance against the enemy, a sentiment shared by all. Declaring war against a foreign power is a matter of national survival, of utmost importance. It is reminiscent of Goujian, a feudal king of two thousand years ago, who, before waging war against Wu, prioritized the aspirations of the people. Only when the people approved did the King of Yue dare to mobilize. Today, you have not only failed to consult with the Central Government but have also disregarded the entire populace, recklessly using local troops to seize southern Hunan and deploy them in Jiangxi and Fujian, disrespecting Party and military discipline, and treating the national organization like discarded shoes. Your rashness is even inferior to that of a small feudal court. Saving the nation from danger is not like gambling. To perish without resistance is indeed unacceptable, but recklessly waging war and losing the country is even more criminal. The advantages and disadvantages have already been explained in detail by the Central Government. Furthermore, rumors circulate that your actions have international backing. If true, it would be as Committee Member Zou Haibin said, an unbearable plot to use Chinese to control Chinese. The national crisis has reached a critical juncture; how can we bear to continue internal strife? Preserving even a fraction of our vitality will add to our strength to resist the enemy, and will also leave a blessing for your descendants. If there are matters beneficial to the Party and the country, they can be discussed at length. How can you use national forces for personal grievances? Once a strong enemy presses upon us, how will you extricate yourselves? You will be unable to escape blame for millennia. We hope you will take a broad and far-sighted view, pull back from the brink, maintain unity, and jointly resist foreign aggression. We are apprehensive and await your wise consideration. The Shanghai Security Corps Special Party Headquarters of the Chinese Kuomintang. [Seal] (Telegram Two) To the Central Executive Committee, Chairman Lin of the National Government, Premier Jiang of the Executive Yuan, Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission, Vice Chairman Feng, Vice Chairman Yan: We recently sent a telegram to Committee Member Chen Bonan, Li Delin, Bai Jiansheng, stating (see above). At this time of rapid global changes, with the enemy's flames high and the nation's lifeline hanging by a thread, how can we bear to engage in internal strife, inviting the disaster of division? We admire your loyalty and dedication to the country. We hope you will uphold the spirit of solidarity and promptly devise effective measures to eliminate hidden dangers. The future of the Party and the country rests on this. The Shanghai Security Corps Special Party Headquarters of the Chinese Kuomintang. [Seal]</p>
<p>Telegram from the Seamen's Branch: (Telegram One) Yesterday, the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Union telegraphed the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities, stating: To the Guangzhou Southwestern Political Affairs Committee and Commander-in-Chief Chen Bonan, Guilin Commander-in-Chief Li Delin, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Bai Jiansheng, and all commanders: It is reported that you are mobilizing troops from Guangdong and Guangxi to move north across the border, ostensibly to resist Japan and save the nation, which is what the people desire. However, this matter is of great importance, concerning the survival of the entire nation and people. It cannot be hastily undertaken with the financial and military resources of a single region. Recent reports from both domestic and foreign sources indicate that this is a pretense of resisting the enemy, while in reality, it is venting grievances. Rumors abound, causing heartache. At this critical moment when the nation is in danger of collapse, we should follow the overall strategy to resist aggression, save the nation, and strive for survival. How can we bear to engage in internal strife, falling into the enemy's trap of using Chinese to control Chinese and hastening the nation's demise? You have long held important responsibilities for the Party and the country. You must consider this carefully and avoid leaving shame for future generations. At this critical juncture, we earnestly hope you will put aside all personal grievances, concentrate your will, and present your case at the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, striving for the nation's survival and the people's equality. Four hundred million people are bowing in prayer. We specially submit this telegram for your consideration. The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Union. [Seal] (Telegram Two) The union also telegraphed the Central Government, stating: To Chairman Lin of the National Government in Nanjing, Premier Jiang of the Executive Yuan, Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission, Vice Chairman Feng, Vice Chairman Yan: Recent reports indicate that the Guangdong and Guangxi armies have mobilized on a large scale, with troops approaching Hunan, ostensibly to resist Japan and save the nation. Their words are sweet, but their hearts are like daggers, using this pretext to unite the people and vent their personal grievances, treating the lives of the nation and its people like grass. If they were not completely heartless, how could they do this? A single tree cannot support a mansion, but united wills can form a fortress. Resisting aggression and saving the nation require a comprehensive plan, a complete organization, and unity from top to bottom to achieve success. Otherwise, it will only hasten the nation's demise. The disaster of the Four Garrisons at the end of the Ming Dynasty serves as a warning. We dare to urgently submit that you promptly order a halt to all military actions and convene the Second Plenary Session to jointly plan for the country's future and avert disaster. We are overcome with anticipation. The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Union. [Seal]</p>
<p>Telegram from the Overseas Chinese Federation: (Telegram One) To Guangzhou Commander-in-Chief Chen, Nanning Commander-in-Chief Li, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Bai: Since the Mukden Incident, Japanese imperialists have been taking advantage of every opportunity. All people of conscience share a common hatred for the enemy. Overseas Chinese, in particular, are eager to resist aggression, as this is the only way to save the nation and ensure its survival. However, resistance requires the arming of the entire population, coordinated steps, unified commands, and adequate preparations. Only then can we avenge years of humiliation and realize unprecedented achievements. If only a few people act unilaterally, disregarding the interests of the nation, we fear that the enemy will not be defeated, but the country will be shattered first. We believe that you, who bear important responsibilities, would not do this. It is reported that you have deployed troops to Hunan under the guise of resisting Japan, but in reality, you are engaging in internal conflict. The whole country is shocked and dismayed. At a time when a strong neighbor is pressing upon us and the nation is in danger, the government and the people should unite to respond calmly and protect national rights. How can we bear to engage in internal strife, causing endless harm for generations to come? Even in terms of resisting Japan, it is detrimental to both the country and the public to mobilize troops far away. We hope you will pull back from the brink, promptly withdraw the troops in Hunan, comply with public sentiment, and forever end the scourge of war. We are sending this telegram with tears and earnest anticipation. The Overseas Chinese Federation. [Seal] (Telegram Two) To Chairman Lin of the National Government in Nanjing, Premier Jiang of the Executive Yuan, Vice Premier Kong, Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission, Vice Chairman Feng, Vice Chairman Yan: We recently sent a telegram to the authorities in Guangdong and Guangxi, stating (see original text above). We earnestly implore you to prioritize the nation and the people, weigh the advantages and disadvantages, and take appropriate action to persuade the blind followers and punish the domineering elements to prevent turmoil and strengthen the nation. This is our earnest plea. We respectfully submit this telegram for your consideration. The Overseas Chinese Federation. [Seal] (Telegram Three) To all overseas party branches, Chinese associations, chambers of commerce, labor unions, schools, newspapers, reading rooms, and other overseas Chinese organizations: The depth of the enemy's aggression has never been greater than it is today. All people of conscience share the goal of unity and national salvation. However, the authorities in Guangdong and Guangxi, driven by personal resentment, disregard public sentiment and arbitrarily mobilize troops to invade neighboring provinces, outwardly advocating resistance against Japan and national salvation, while inwardly initiating internal conflict. The Central Government, in a spirit of generosity, has repeatedly made concessions to avoid conflict, recognizing that each instance of internal strife reduces our ability to resist foreign aggression. Those responsible for the central government must consider all aspects and avoid sacrificing our strength to resist external aggression in internal conflict unless absolutely necessary. However, if the Guangdong troops entering Hunan do not heed the Central Government's advice and continue to advance north, there is little hope for peace. If a strong neighbor seizes the opportunity to advance, China will be lost in an instant. Our association is heartbroken by the national crisis and determined to save the nation. In addition to openly urging the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities to pull back from the brink, withdraw their troops, and await a reasonable solution at the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, and telegraphing the Central Government to take appropriate action to eliminate the hidden dangers of division, we also hope that overseas Chinese will unite in their demands, exert public pressure, and avert the impending disaster. It would be a blessing for the nation and the people. The Overseas Chinese Federation. [Seal]</p>
<p>Telegram from the United Association of the First Special Municipality: The branches of the United Association of Citizens of the First Special District and 29 other organizations yesterday jointly telegraphed the authorities of Guangdong and Guangxi, stating: To Commander-in-Chief Li and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Bai in Nanning, Guangxi: We are greatly dismayed and concerned by reports of the Guangxi army's actions in Hengyang. You led the Northern Expedition and unified the country, achieving great achievements that will be remembered for centuries. The Party and the country praised you, history recorded you, and the people admired you. Now, because of foreign rumors and exaggerated propaganda that create conspiracies, internal conflict has erupted. Looking back at your past achievements, how can you not feel heartbroken? We earnestly request that you consider the perilous state of the nation and preserve this remaining strength. Immediately withdraw your troops and return to your original positions to appease the people. We hope you will preserve your elite forces and not be exploited, falling victim to their insidious plots, and jointly plan for the great task of saving the nation and restoring our territories in the future. We earnestly and urgently pray for your determined efforts. The branches of the United Association of Citizens of the First Special District in Shanghai. [Seal]</p>
<p>Telegrams from the Two Public Organizations in Chaozhou: The Shanghai Chaozhou Guild and the Shanghai Chaozhou Fellow Countrymen Association jointly telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Chen Jitang of the First Army Group in Guangzhou, Commander-in-Chief Li Zongren and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi of the Fourth Army Group in Nanning, stating: Misfortune has befallen China, and foreign aggression is rampant. Your commitment to resisting the enemy inspires all people of conscience. However, reports indicate that the Guangdong and Guangxi armies have entered Hunan, causing deep concern among the people. Whether to make peace or wage war with the enemy requires planning and steps, and the country must be united to achieve victory. Moreover, an organized nation must obey the Central Government. If it is a local action, it will only invite contempt from the enemy and also incite internal conflict. Mutual suspicion will lead to destruction. No disaster in ancient or modern times is more tragic than this. You are saving the world and must not resort to such a poor strategy. We hope you will preserve a glimmer of hope and plan for a comprehensive strategy, heed the advice of the masses, and jointly work for the greater good. The nation will depend on it. Some say that you are driven by anger and righteous indignation to conduct a military remonstrance. If so, you must pull back from the brink. A single hair can tip the scales. Your actions must correct the perceptions of the nation. Then the country and its people will be fortunate. The Shanghai Chaozhou Guild, The Shanghai Chaozhou Fellow Countrymen Association.

<p>Telegram from the National Goods Joint Association: The Chinese National Goods Joint Association issued a circular telegram, stating: To the newspapers in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Wuzhou, for the information of all organizations: At a time when the situation in North China is critical, and the central government troops are going to defend the border, Guangdong and Guangxi suddenly use resistance to Japan as a slogan and point their weapons inward. It is a well-known fact that Guangxi has hired as many as 200 Japanese military advisors and receives military supplies from them. Guangdong has recently remitted 20 million cash to purchase military supplies from its eastern neighbor. Under such circumstances, mobilizing troops, the intention is self-evident and the consequences are unimaginable. We believe that foreign enemies have insulted us to this point, and we must fight to the end. However, preparations should be made with unity of mind from top to bottom, and the dispatch of troops should be nationwide. If we suddenly engage in internal strife at this time, it will only create an opportunity for the enemy to invade the north and the entire country. Our compatriots should not sit idly by and watch the country perish. We respectfully request that compatriots in all regions jointly appeal to the southwest to stop this kind of free action, abandon personal grievances, and jointly plan for the great cause of the nation to save the situation and assist the external defense. We would be most fortunate. The Chinese National Goods Joint Association. [Seal]</p>
<h3 id="e104">Various Countries Initiate Celebrations for Yu Qiaqing's 70th Birthday <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Yu Qiaqing is enthusiastic about public welfare and charity, and has made many contributions to the Party and the country over the years. July 6th of this year marks his 70th birthday and the 55th anniversary of his residence in Shanghai. Mayor Wu and leaders from all sectors have initiated a move to transfer birthday gifts for the construction of the Yu Qiaqing Anti-Tuberculosis Hospital, and have designated the coastal area of Wusong as the site for the hospital. It has also been decided to develop it into a park for commemoration. Recently, representatives from all sectors convened a meeting and appointed Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Zuoting, Li Tingan, Li Dachao, and others as members of the preparatory committee for the Yu Qiaqing Anti-Tuberculosis Hospital. The office is located in the Ningbo Fellow Countrymen Association. A commemorative meeting will be held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on July 4th, inviting participation from all sectors. Mayor Wu will also invite foreign dignitaries to attend. On the 5th and 6th, celebrations will be held at the Ningbo Fellow Countrymen Association. Invitations have been sent to various organizations and leaders from all sectors, requesting their enthusiastic support to jointly accomplish this great undertaking. The origin of the project is recorded below:</p>
<p>(Solicitation for Essays on Mr. Yu Qiaqing's 70th Birthday and 55th Anniversary in Shanghai, and the Establishment of the Yu Qiaqing Anti-Tuberculosis Hospital in Wusong) It is said, "To let those who know first awaken those who know later, to let those who are aware first awaken those who are aware later." "Knowing" and "being aware" are listed equally, but the meaning is vastly different. Knowing is a matter of acquired knowledge, while being aware is a matter of innate ability. Knowing comes from accumulation and gradual development, while being aware arises suddenly from nothing. Is Mr. Yu Qiaqing of Zhenhai a man of foreknowledge or a man of foresight? Please examine his life and deeds to judge for yourselves. Mr. Yu came to Shanghai at the age of fifteen to study commerce. Upon entering the market, his talent astonished the experienced merchants. Within a few years, he went from being an employee of the Ruikang Dye Company to a compradore of the Lu Lin Foreign Firm. At a young age, he dominated the market and presided over public associations, which was rare since the opening of the port. Commercial affairs emphasize the accumulation of capital rather than rapid progress, and rely on experience rather than sudden changes. Mr. Yu broke the ordinary commercial history, like a dragon appearing in the fields. In the past, it was rare to see such a change. Who else but Mr. Yu, endowed with creative commercial talent, could have achieved this? Moreover, Mr. Yu is a businessman who excels in business, and his ambition is like an affair. He transforms to engage in politics, and politics is guided by Mr. Yu's ambition. He is not like an official who only works in one position and only serves one region. I once commented that since the opening of Shanghai, the Manchu government has been ignorant of foreign affairs. They signed treaties that ceded rights and humiliated the country without end. The people who were born, raised, and made their living here were restricted and bound by these treaties. They were not allowed to complain or seek redress. They had almost accepted this as their second nature, content to remain in this state forever. But Mr. Yu was like a morning rooster in Runan, mounting the platform to awaken the people. After a long period of accumulation, he took advantage of the dawn to fight for clarity. A great wave was formed, overturning the foreign powers, starting with the cemetery case and followed by the uproar in the public hall. What was the cemetery case? The Siming Public Cemetery was a public area established by the people of Ningbo to honor their ancestors. The people of Ningbo value friendship and righteousness above all else, and they cherish their ancestral graves even more. Thus, the French attempted to seize the land, but they were repeatedly thwarted. Mr. Yu, along with Yan Xiaofang, Ye Chengzhong, Shen Zhongli, and other elders, took charge of the matter and refused to yield. Therefore, on May 28th of the 24th year of Guangxu, the French Consul Bai Zhaotai, realizing that empty threats would not work, hastily mobilized troops to destroy the cemetery walls, determined to seize the public cemetery. The situation suddenly became dire. Yan, Ye, Shen, and others were at a loss. Mr. Yu said, "The French destroy the cemetery walls because the cemetery has no country to protect it. They destroy the country because the country has no people to choose it. If the cemetery walls are destroyed, the country is destroyed. If the country is destroyed, the people are destroyed. We must stand up for the people and fight for the country. People must stand up for the country and fight for the cemetery walls." His thoughts circled like a ring, unspoken but like an order. Next, he used the people of Ningbo to represent the people of the country, and used himself to represent the people of Ningbo's deep awareness, like a shadow following its form, almost without thinking, and so it was. Mr. Yu was furious, and all the people of Shanghai gathered at his command. The case started with Shen Hongmai raising objections, and ended with Bai Zhaotai apologizing. Mr. Yu commanded with calm assurance, as if nothing had happened. His achievement was as great as Xiang Ru's saving Zhao's walls, and his plan was superior to the Lu people's returning the invaded land. This was the most important battle, in which he used righteousness to manage affairs and made decisive decisions. Without precedent or external support, who can say from what source this awareness came? Seven years later, a Cantonese woman named Huang, whose husband had died in Sichuan, was taking her maid back to Guangdong via Shanghai. The Municipal Council accused her of trafficking in persons and detained her. Councilor Jin Gongbo argued for her release. The Western police made a great disturbance, and the so-called New Yamen was instructed by the British Vice Consul De Wei to have the police beat Jin at the gate, tearing his official robes. The people heard this and went on strike. The Western merchants also went on strike in response. The situation was very precarious. At that time, the Manchu Prince Zai Ze was passing through Shanghai on his way to study constitutional government abroad. Yuan Shuxun, the Customs Taotai, was also helpless. Mr. Yu then invited Zhu Baosan, Zhou Jinzhen, Shi Ziying, and others to mediate. After repeated efforts, they finally reached a settlement. De Wei was dismissed, the police chief was punished, and more than 500 arrested people were released. The cloudy sky cleared. Our country had long been restricted by the consular jurisdiction system. At this point, we showed the true strength of the people and took a step toward recovering legal rights. People praised Mr. Yu's ability to plan carefully and never give up when facing difficulties. Who gave Mr. Yu this awareness? Was it Dong Zhongshu's effort to understand or Lao Tzu's natural transformation? After this, foreigners began to respect us. How did we achieve self-governance? Mr. Yu's first priority was to establish himself and others. He resisted the powerful forces from the outside and upheld righteousness from the inside. The Chinese seat on the Municipal Council was available, but it was limited to Mr. Yu alone. Mr. Yu said this was an insult to the Chinese people. Then he invited Hu Jimei and Yuan Hengzhi to build a sports field in Zhabei, change to yellow uniforms, and undergo training to advocate for this. Many merchants joined Mr. Yu. The Chinese self-defense force became a reality. The Chinese team in the International Chamber of Commerce was formed. This team was effective in resisting foreign aggression and protecting merchants. The idea of revolution at the end of the Qing Dynasty was also fostered because of this. During the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Yu and Mr. Chen Qimei relied on this force to restore Shanghai and Songhu. Later, the southern provinces followed suit. Governor Cheng Dequan of Suzhou was able to revolt because of Mr. Yu's mediation and assistance. The republic was founded, and the north and south were united. Everyone thought they had made a great contribution and celebrated, but Mr. Yu did not participate. For more than ten years, the political system changed, but democracy did not advance. Young people were angry and could not be restrained. In May of the 14th year, Shanghai students demonstrated against the Northern government. The Western police fired 44 shots and injured people, causing great disorder. The turmoil was no less than the previous cemetery case and the uproar in the public hall. How did he manage to suppress and coordinate to restore peace, so that the people commemorate the May 30th Incident to this day, without losing the great significance of the national rights movement in history? All of this was due to Mr. Yu's handling of the matter at that time. Everyone says that Fan Zhongyan was the first to worry about the world and the last to enjoy it. Mr. Yu believes that there has never been joy in the world. His own worries have no order. How great is Mr. Yu! The drowned are drowning, the hungry are hungry. For 55 years, he has served the people tirelessly. This is Mr. Yu's heart, but compared to Yu's three passes, eight years is still too short, and his achievements have far exceeded them. At the turn of the Guangxu era, the Chinese first heard about industrial innovation, but they could not implement it. Only Mr. Yu established the Siming Bank and the Ningbo-Shaoxing Steamship Company. The former was to intercept foreign merchants' manipulation of finance, and the latter was to seize foreign ships' monopoly of shipping. The Nanjing Promotion of Righteousness Association was the seed of the national product exhibition. Mr. Yu and Governor-General Duanfang of Jiangsu presided over it. Although the start of this meeting was simple, it will be a great and important event in our industrial history. The hardships and complexities were all managed by Mr. Yu. He forgot his toil and grievances, as if nothing had happened. These are just the most obvious of Mr. Yu's undertakings. These emerging industries in the past 50 years would not have been possible without Mr. Yu's words and actions. Even if his words and actions did not necessarily lead to his involvement, others could succeed. Mr. Yu's principle of action is like this. Moreover, Mr. Yu's awareness is the earliest and most genuine, like water pouring into the ground, penetrating everything. Therefore, he can handle everything calmly and impartially. Recently, he has been taking care of the affairs of the Sanbei Shipping Company and the Longshan Wharf, which are all matters of his hometown. This is a return to simplicity after splendor, to establish a diligent intention and to show his respect for his hometown. It seems that it is not yet time to enjoy the happiness. This year, July 6th marks Mr. Yu's 70th birthday and the 55th anniversary of his residence in Shanghai. We thought we should celebrate it to promote national heroes and wish him longevity. Mr. Yu said no, the country is in such a difficult situation, how can we talk about longevity and commemoration? We said yes, because of the national crisis, Mr. Yu's birthday cannot but be celebrated, and Mr. Yu's deeds cannot but be commemorated. Why? Because if everyone can have Mr. Yu's awareness, or receive his awareness, the country will have no difficulties. Therefore, we all agree with this intention. We will write it down to inspire scholars and allow them to base their own views and celebrate this great man of the world to celebrate the world. We will commemorate this great man of the world to inspire the world. How to celebrate, how to inspire? We all say that anti-tuberculosis is an important health policy today. We should gather funds to build an anti-tuberculosis hospital in Wusong and name it after Mr. Yu to show that we will not forget him. Mr. Yu's kindness will be endless, and the symbol of enlightenment will become clearer with the passage of time. This is the solicitation.</p>

<p>It is a Mediation and Not an Administrative Punishment, and a Party Who is Dissatisfied Can File a Lawsuit in the Judiciary</p>
<p>The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau previously received a letter from the Supervisory Audit Office inquiring about the nature of the Bureau's Collision Committee. After receiving the letter, the Bureau requested the Ministry of Communications to provide an explanation. Yesterday, it received Instruction No. 5807 from the Ministry of Communications, stating: The report has been noted. The organization of the Ship Collision Dispute Resolution Committee is for mediation purposes. The handling letter clarifying responsibility is not an administrative punishment. It is different from the case where people are dissatisfied with the punishment of the administrative authorities and can file an appeal according to the provisions of the Law on Appeals. If one party is dissatisfied with the handling, they should file a lawsuit directly with the judicial authorities. You should be informed of this order.</p>

However, due to the fact that silk manufacturers and merchants are currently busy with cocoon harvesting, it has been decided to postpone the meeting to 2:00 PM on the 22nd, which will still be held at the Commodity Inspection Bureau. The Shanghai Silk Manufacturers Association has scheduled a general membership meeting for 3:00 PM on the 19th to discuss and nominate representatives to attend the conference.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Request for Transfer of Jurisdiction - Xu Wancheng's Testimony in Court <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Initially Unresponsive, He Answered Only After Counsel's Guidance; Judge Refused Bail and Ordered Continued Detention</p>
<p>Xu Wancheng, an editor at the Longwen Bookstore at the intersection of Zhonghua Road and Baiyang Lane in Dananmen, published an advertisement in the Minbao newspaper on June 3rd for a special issue of his work report, "Xu Wancheng's Work Report," promoting his upcoming book. A section in this special issue, entitled "An Investigation into the Dark Side of Chinese Justice," contained</p>
<p>many attacks on the entire Shanghai District Court and implicated Judge Zhao. District Court Judges Zhao Yongzhou and Zhao Yuesheng, citing the mention of Judge Zhao, argued that he should be directed to file charges and that it was discovered Xu Wancheng had previously lost a debt case before Judge Zhao. Furthermore, he had been fined four yuan by the court for failing to affix stamp duty, and upon his failure to pay, the execution division dispatched a bailiff to arrest and detain him. They claimed that these were all private grievances used to libel through newspaper advertisements. Therefore, Judge Zhao and others filed a complaint. Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu of the Prosecutor's Office summoned Xu for questioning, and Xu claimed that Judge Zhao and others had taken bribes, which he had reprinted from other newspapers. The prosecutor was asked to produce the newspapers as evidence. Xu was not detained that day, nor was bail set. Subsequently, on</p>
<p>June 5th, Xu sent a letter to the "Legal Commentary" column of the Minbao newspaper, stating that court clerks openly soliciting money was a fact and that the court's pursuit of libel charges was a face-saving measure, further expressing indignation over the alleged humiliation. Therefore, at 2:00 PM on the 7th of this month, Prosecutor Tang continued the interrogation. However, Xu claimed it was the affair of Du Jiasheng and Tan Zhuohong, etc. The prosecutor pointed out that Du and Tan not only had different characters but also different pronunciations from Zhao, and considered this conduct reprehensible. Xu was immediately detained on charges of obstructing official duties and libel and prosecuted. At 9:30 AM yesterday, Judge Lu Hongyi of the Criminal Division opened the 12th courtroom for trial. Xu Wancheng's attorneys, Shu Shengmin and Ding Zhemin, from his native place, appeared in court. Before Xu was brought into the courtroom, the judge informed the defense attorneys that Xu Wancheng had submitted a petition to the court yesterday requesting a transfer of jurisdiction. Therefore, the case should await the decision of the High Court, and no debate would be held today. At this point, Xu was brought into the courtroom. The judge asked Xu his age, hometown, address, and occupation. Xu replied that he was 31 years old, from Jinshan, Songjiang, and worked as a teacher and editor, residing at the Longwen Bookstore. The judge asked, "Did you publish the work report in the Minbao on June 3rd?" Xu replied, "I am now requesting a transfer of jurisdiction." The judge said, "The transfer of jurisdiction is a matter of transfer; we will question you today first, and you must answer." Xu replied, "I published it. Why did you publish it?" "I want to transfer jurisdiction; this place</p>
<p>cannot question me." The judge said, "The transfer of jurisdiction is a matter for the High Court, and the facts of this case must still be questioned today." "I am requesting a transfer of jurisdiction; I cannot speak," and he pulled out a law book and recited a section of the Criminal Procedure Law on the transfer of jurisdiction. Everyone in the courtroom listening was</p>
<p>speechless. Later, after his defense attorneys guided him, saying that providing testimony was separate from the transfer, and there was no conflict, Xu finally agreed to answer. At this point, the judge continued to question Xu Wancheng: "You published in the newspaper, saying things about a pistol and Judge Zhao and others taking bribes, and so on. What did you mean?" "The stolen pistol was a fact, and writing about the responsibility of the president and others was an emotional outburst from us scholars, so we wrote out the facts." "Do you know you committed a crime?" "I wrote it out; I didn't know it was against the law." "You said court clerks often openly solicit money." "I have witnesses because a court clerk solicited money from me." "What's his name?" "He wouldn't say." "According to what you said, it was one court clerk. Why did you say 'often openly solicit money'?" "When I say 'often,' it could be three people, or one person; it's a matter of sentiment." "What is the name of your witness?" "Liu Lianyuan." "You said Judge Zhao took bribes; which Judge Zhao?" "I saw an image in the newspaper of a judge being escorted to Nanjing. Later, flipping through old newspapers, I learned it was Du Jiasheng. I remembered wrongly, mistaking him for Zhao Jiasheng; it was a case from Pudong." "Du Jiasheng is a prosecutor, not a judge. Judge Tan Zhuohong also committed a crime and was escorted to Suzhou. It was this mistake." "The Minbao of June 5th was also sent and published in your name, saying that court clerks solicit money is real, and that the court is suing you for libel in the matter of Judge Zhao as a face-saving measure?" "It was an error about Du and Tan." At this point in the interrogation, the judge announced</p>
<p>suspension of the trial to await submission to higher authorities and review after the ruling on the transfer of jurisdiction. The defendant's attorney immediately requested bail in court. The judge said that after he published in the newspaper on the 3rd of this month, the prosecutor summoned him to court but did not grant bail. Yet he published again, insulting the court. In his mind, there is simply no court or law. Therefore, bail is denied. Xu Wancheng, anxious, said, "My attorney can guarantee it; I won't publish in the newspaper again." The judge said, "You will still await the ruling of the High Court." Xu then said, "I am sick." The judge said, "If you are sick, there is a medical officer in the detention center. If you are severely ill, you can be sent to the Xinpu Yutang. Bail is still denied." He then ordered Judicial Police Chief Zhang Shuping and others to take him down and return him to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Court Approves Suspension of Jiang Xingjie Estate Case <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Both Parties Reached Agreement on Principles Outside of Court - Establishing an Estate Clearing Committee</p>
<p>After the death of Nanjing-based Shanghai tycoon Jiang Xingjie, his youngest son, Jiang Guopei, claimed that all the estate was controlled by his stepmother, Jiang Yang, and his elder brothers, Guo You and Guo Zhang. He hired attorneys He Shiming and Fan Gang to file a property division lawsuit with the First Special District Court, demanding one-third of his late father's estate of three million yuan, totaling one million yuan, and requesting a preliminary injunction. The First Special Court had summoned the parties several times. The defendant Jiang Yang's attorneys, Jiang Yiping and Wang Fuchang, stated that the plaintiffs and defendants were mother and sons, brothers, and that reconciliation was preferable. Therefore, the court granted a postponement to attempt reconciliation, and the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction was approved. It is now learned that during the postponement, Jiang Yang and others, through their attorneys, submitted a statement refuting the plaintiff's claims that she was Jiang Xingjie's concubine and regarding the amount of the estate. They stated that she was Xingjie's second wife, and Jiang Xingjie's will repeatedly referred to "wife Yang," as did the obituary, which referred to "Retiree" (Jiang Xingjie) in his self-description at age 50 in 1918 as "Yang succeeding in managing the household." The plaintiff's claim that she was not a spouse was unreasonable. As for the plaintiff's claim that Xingjie's estate was three million, the ten-odd mu of land on Jing'an Temple Road, Baker Road, and Parker Road, and the ten-odd mu of land on Yokohoma Bridge, have never been owned by the Jiang family. The plaintiff should bear the burden of proof. Furthermore, the will clearly stated that debts owed amounted to over 470,000, totaling over 600,000 with interest, all secured by property. This was merely the plaintiff's empty claim. Moreover, the plaintiff included in the estate a portion that Jiang Xingjie had given to others before his death and her own personal property, which was inappropriate. Therefore, if division was necessary, the estate should be cleared to thoroughly resolve the matter. It was requested that the lawsuit be suspended until Jiang Xingjie's estate had been cleared of debts, and that one-tenth of the remaining balance be distributed to the plaintiff, dismissing the plaintiff's lawsuit. An appeal was also filed with the Second Branch of the High Court against the preliminary injunction issued by the First Special Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Peng Shi continued the hearing in Civil Chamber Four. The attorneys for the plaintiff and defendant, He Shiming, Wang Fuchang, and Jiang Yiping, stated that both parties had reached an agreement on principles outside of court. The terms were that each side would nominate one or two representatives to form an estate clearing committee to handle the company clearing and analysis according to the following methods: (1) Determine the types and items of Jiang Xingjie's estate. (2) Determine Jiang Xingjie's debts before his death and the debts belonging to the estate, their items, amounts, and payment schedule. (3) Jiang Yang's personal property shall not be included in the estate. The standards are as follows: (A) Property originally registered under Jiang Yang's personal name before the start of inheritance and items for personal use should be considered her personal property. (B) Property transferred to Jiang Yang's name after the start of inheritance should be considered Jiang Xingjie's estate. (4) The method of estate division and the shares to be received by each person should be discussed and consulted with reference to how Xingjie's estate was handled. A contract has been established and should be recorded in the minutes, and the lawsuit should be suspended. Judge Peng approved this and announced that the lawsuit should be suspended.</p>

<p>Recently, rabid dogs and pigs have become extremely rampant in this city, posing a significant threat to pedestrians. According to a report from the Datong News Agency, the Municipal Council's Health Department stated that in April of this year, one ten-year-old girl died from a rabid dog bite on her left cheek. Despite eighteen days of treatment and injections, she ultimately perished. Additionally, a twenty-eight-year-old man died from a rabid pig bite. At the same time, 110 people went to the Municipal Council's Medical Testing Laboratory seeking treatment for rabies. Except for fourteen people who came from other places, the remaining ninety-six were all from this city. This proves the prevalence of rabid dogs and pigs in Shanghai, and residents should pay close attention.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Major Brawl Among Fishing Boat Crews <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Nine People Detained from Each Side</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, boatmen led by Guan Laigen (originally transporting fresh fish) had a misunderstanding with boatmen led by Liu Yousheng (initially loading ice-fresh fish) due to being hired to transport ice-fresh yellow croaker. Subsequently, both sides gathered large numbers of crew members and engaged in a brawl at the fish market dock, wielding weapons as if facing a major enemy. The situation was serious and nearly caused a major disaster. Market employee Fang Xuewen reported the incident to the Shanghai Municipal Water Patrol Corps. Upon receiving the report, Corps Commander Wei personally led officers, including Detective Foreman Liu Jinsheng and Detectives Deng Jiagen, to suppress the riot. They arrested Guan Laigen (47 years old), Guan Bangzhao (42 years old), Wu Tianbi (55 years old), Zhang Bizhu (22 years old), Qian Youfu (44 years old), all from Taizhou, Wang Mingkui (20 years old), Jiangyin County, Liu Shuanglin (40 years old), and Fei Shuangxi (33 years old), along with the nine defendants led by Liu Yousheng (32 years old), Dong Henglong (32 years old), Liu Rusheng (31 years old), Xu Jinlong (38 years old), Jiang Shigui (18 years old), all from Taizhou, Ma Chaojin (40 years old), Xu Zhengfu (30 years old), Yi Chaoyin (30 years old), and Jiang Shifu (34 years old). The remaining people scattered. The authorities seized a steel ruler, an axe, and four wooden clubs. The injured Liu Shuanglin, Ma Chaoquan, and others were sent to the hospital for treatment. The arrested plaintiffs and defendants were taken to the team for questioning.</p>

<p>Zhu Qufeng, a 59-year-old man from Nantong currently residing at the Nanshi Security and Nursing Home, has a biological daughter named Yuqing, who is 16 years old this year. She had been betrothed and sent to her future husband's family as a child bride, but the daughter was unhappy, and the marriage was dissolved, requiring Zhu to return the betrothal gifts. Unable to raise the funds, Zhu borrowed money from Wu Wenhai, a man from Wuxi residing at No. 9 Chunde Lane, Lanweiai Road, French Concession, to cover the debt. After taking his daughter back, he placed her in Wu's home as a maid. Zhu recently learned that his daughter Yuqing had been sold by Wu Wenhai to the Jin family residence of Jin Yuntang in Dujia Lane, Nanhui, Pudong, as a daughter-in-law, and had already been married. Zhu reported the matter to the Songshan Road police station on April 13, requesting an investigation. Zhu claimed that his daughter had been taken out by Zhu from a stove shop at the intersection of Gordon Road and Avenue Road. The police station did not accept the case, as the crime scene was not in the French Concession. Recently, Zhu hired a lawyer to file a self-accusation of obstructing public morals against Wu Wenhai with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, requesting a trial. According to the accusation, the court, yesterday, held a hearing presided over by Judge Zhang Chaozuo. The accuser Zhu Qufeng arrived with his lawyer, but the defendant Wu Wenhai did not appear. According to the accuser, his daughter, Yuqing, who is 16 years old this year, was born on May 13, 1921, the Year of the Rooster. She had been betrothed to the tiger stove shop at the intersection of Gordon Road and Avenue Road as a child bride. On July 12 of last year, she was taken out by Wu Wenhai's daughter, Wu Yu, and hidden at No. 20 Hengfeng Lane, Bazilu. After being found by the groom's family, they rejected the girl, and I paid the silver to take my daughter back and placed her in Wu's home as a helper. Unexpectedly, the defendant and his daughter colluded to sell my daughter to the Jin family in Pudong as a daughter-in-law. I request an investigation. The court reviewed the evidence and, considering that the crime scene provided by the accuser was in the Public Concession, ruled that the lawsuit should be filed with the First Special District Court. The court then ruled that the jurisdiction was improper.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Home of Chinese Head Constable Zhang Xinghai Robbed and Plundered <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Losses Exceed 3,000 Yuan - Three Bandits Captured</p>
<p>Zhang Xinghai, a Chinese head constable at the Hongkou Police Station, originally from Beiping, has served the Municipal Council for over ten years. His home is located at No. 8 Longzhi Lane, Kangnaotuo Road, West Shanghai. On April 6 of this year, several bandits armed with weapons suddenly broke into his home, preventing anyone from making noise, and ransacked the house for over an hour. They stole silver dollars and banknotes worth 1,000 yuan, as well as jewelry and clothing worth 2,020 yuan, and fled with the stolen goods. Head Constable Zhang reported the incident to the police station for investigation. Recently, Chinese Detective Feng Baishun, Detective Yao Changmin, Xia Shikui, Wang Dianchen, and others from the Chengdu Road Police Station learned that the gang was hiding at No. 100 Feihong Road, Zhabei. They coordinated with police detectives from the Public Security Bureau and secretly went to the address, arresting the bandits Yang Benzhang from Anhui and his mistress Yang Tian. They found two handguns, three bullets, and 57.5 yuan in banknotes, one gold ring, and a pair of earrings in a rice bag. According to Yang's confession, they also arrested Ge Xueshan, an accomplice, at No. 126 Shunqing Lane, Dafeng Road, Zhabei. However, Ge was well-informed and fled over the rooftops upon seeing the detectives, escaping capture. Later, Li Desheng, an accomplice from Anhui, was arrested on Zhonghua Road and brought back to the police station separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to Criminal Chamber Eight of the First Special Court. Police attorney Zhang Tianyin stated the case and said that the police investigation was not yet complete, so Ge Laoxiao, Chen Jintang, Xiaoyang and others went to rob him. At that time, Xiaoyang and I each held a pistol, and Li Desheng was on the lookout at the alley entrance. Afterward, I received 500 yuan, and Li received 90 yuan. Someone named Zhang works as a maid in a certain family in Longzhi Lane and is having an affair with a rickshaw puller. Later, after Yang's wife was dismissed, they discussed the robbery. Li Desheng had gone to Longzhi Lane three times beforehand to scout. Yang Tian is my mistress and has been in Shanghai for not long. She knows nothing about this case. Li Desheng's testimony was evasive, denying any participation in the robbery. Judge Huang Risheng, after reviewing the confessions, ordered that Yang and the other three be detained for seven days for further interrogation. Yang Tian's child, Yang Liukouzi, was temporarily sent to the Women and Children's Relief Association for care.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times reported that Fan Jifu Da, an Indian man and graduate of the University of Mumbai, is 22 years old. He began his world tour two years ago and, two months ago, traveled through the Chinese mainland on a motorcycle, first to Nanchang, then to Hangzhou, Nanjing, and Suzhou. He arrived in Shanghai on Friday (the 12th). Mr. Fan stated that traveling through the Chinese mainland on a motorcycle is no longer a major difficulty. Although the roads vary in quality, none are excessively poor. Mr. Fan has given lectures in many places along the way, using this to raise travel expenses, and he relies heavily on Chinese people to translate for him. However, when speaking in English at the Rotary Club of Nanjing and other organizations, listeners did not need translation. His lectures are mostly about Indian affairs. Mr. Fan plans to go north to Pingjin, but his movements will largely depend on the development and changes in the political situation. If going north is unstable, he plans to visit Japan instead. Before arriving in the Far East, Mr. Fan had traveled to India and Ceylon, then to Australia, visiting Melbourne, where the World Scout Jamboree was being held. Mr. Fan, being a Boy Scout from Mumbai and having many years of involvement with the Indian Boy Scout movement, participated in the event. The centennial anniversary of the opening of Melbourne was also held at that time, and he was able to attend the grand occasion. Mr. Fan was bitten by a poisonous spider in Australia and was hospitalized for five months, which delayed his stay for a long time. Mr. Fan set out on his journey on May 20, 1934, and has traveled over 7,500 miles to date. He plans to stay in Shanghai for two weeks, then return to India via Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European continent. It is expected to take another two years to complete this 25,000-mile journey.</p>

<p>Hygiene Training - The conference promotion committee believes that public places such as restaurants and entertainment venues have a greater impact on the well-being of citizens if they do not pay attention to hygiene.

Therefore, this year's hygiene campaign has a provision for hygiene knowledge training in public places. It is scheduled to start on the 16th. Shop owners of teahouses, restaurants, bathhouses, barbershops, hot water shops, inns, apartments, tofu shops, butcher shops, vegetable markets, and entertainment venues must personally or send a representative to the Shanghai South, Shanghai North, Gaoqiao, Wusong, and Jiangwan Five Hygiene Offices to register and await training.

<p>Yue Shurong Suspected in the Abduction of Shi Jinlong's Young Son</p>
<p>Shi Jinlong, a native of Danyang who is over forty years old and owns the Xingsheng small tobacco and paper shop at No. 171 Xiangyan Bridge Road, Zhabei, only has one son named Maotou, who is eleven years old. On the afternoon of the 7th of last month, he was suddenly abducted and went missing. Shi searched for him but could not find him. On June 6th, Shi received three threatening letters by mail, with similar wording, claiming that Shi's son was in a certain location and that a ransom of one thousand yuan was required. The second and third letters reduced the ransom from one thousand yuan to seven hundred yuan and five hundred yuan. Shi was alarmed upon reading the letters. Yue Shurong, a fellow villager (37 years old) residing on Route Conty in the French Concession, went to Shi's place and claimed that he was willing to negotiate with the bandits on Shi's behalf, but to date, there have been no results, and Shi has already been swindled out of a considerable amount of travel expenses. Yesterday morning around 10:00 AM, Shi reported the case to the Linping Road Police Station, which sent officers to arrest Yue for questioning. Because the case involved kidnapping and suspected threatening letters, the situation was serious, so it was reported to the Headquarters for further investigation.</p>

<p>Details of Ping An Dock's "Caisson" Being Washed Away</p>
<p>Not Due to Years of Disrepair, But Due to High Tide</p>
<p>The Ping An Dock, belonging to the Gongmao Machinery Shipbuilding Plant, is located at the mouth of Bailianjing, Pudong. The location is ideal, and it is the only commercial dock. It has been in operation for forty years, starting in the 14th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, and was operated by the late merchant Zheng Liangyu. The dock is 260 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 12 feet deep, which is very suitable for the repair of general ships. The dock fees are low, which is very popular with the shipping industry. After minor repairs this year, the dock work is even busier. The dock's caisson has been used frequently, and for convenience, it was originally planned to add safety equipment to ensure stability. The management carefully considered the matter and consulted shipbuilding experts to ensure that it would meet the needs. It was in the process of estimating the labor and materials for construction when, on the morning of the 10th of this month, it was impacted by a high tide, causing an irresistible accident. The caisson itself is completely a floating cuboid. If the dock has no water, due to the imbalance of water pressure, if the ballast at the bottom is lacking, there is a risk of it being washed away. The dock has always had experience in managing the dock and guiding ships in and out. This Huangpu high tide has been happening for three days. On the afternoon of the 9th, it was also around 13 feet. The sudden impact at 2:00 AM on the 10th was unexpected. The Minsheng Industrial Company's Min Duo ship, which was being repaired in the dock, was not yet completed and suffered the disaster. Fortunately, the loss was not great. Manager Zheng and Manager Zhang of the Minsheng Company have a good relationship with the factory's management and expressed sympathy for the dock's accident. The Gongmao Shipbuilding Plant will completely repair the damaged parts of the Min Duo ship, which shows their business integrity and is very admirable. The dock has been working hard for two days to reorganize and has already completed the work. The planned repair work has also been renewed. From now on, it will be more convenient for ships to enter the dock for repair and inspection. It is reported that the factory will revise the new dock fee collection rate to help alleviate the shipping industry's recession.</p>

<p>To the Editor, I have just read in today's newspaper a news item about the opening of the Xuzhou Highway, which stated that it was built by the "Chinese and Foreign Relief Association." Please note that the name of our association is the "China Chinese and Foreign Relief and Disaster Relief Association," abbreviated as the "Chinese and Foreign Relief Association." It is a group registered with the Ministry of Interior and has obtained legal person status. In order to provide relief to the disaster victims in northern Jiangsu, the Subei Yellow Disaster Relief and Industrial Reconstruction Office was established in February of this year to carry out the Xuhai Second Release Road Project. The Xufang project plans to build five roads, namely Tongpei, Tongdang, Tongshui, Tongsuyi, and Tongxiao, with a total length of 150 li, and 10 li of ring road. The Haifang road construction starts from Xiangshuikou to Banpu, and then turns northwest to Xinpu, with a total length of 130 li. It has not yet been completed. The roads built in Xuzhou have been completed last week. After the opening ceremony is held on the 12th of this month, the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Tong District Commissioner's Office will accept the acceptance and open it to traffic. The newspaper mistakenly called it the "Chinese and Foreign Relief Association," which is neither the abbreviation used by our association, nor does it easily raise suspicions from the outside world, and it does not affect the credibility of our association with donors. Accordingly, we send a special letter to declare this, hoping to check and correct it. Sincerely, The China Chinese and Foreign Relief and Disaster Relief Association Shanghai Office, 25, 6, 13,</p>

<h3 id="e148">A General Review of the Athletics Selection <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Huaiqing</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the candidates for the World Games athletics team, the criticism from the outside world has been truly "uproarious" and a spectacular sight. The controversy over the basketball team has long passed; the so-called amateur event of the football team is also called the "aftermath"; and now the error in the athletics selection is becoming more and more widespread. It has become the "autumn of troubles" in the domestic sports world for the sake of attending the World Games! "Those who speak are sincere, those who listen are indifferent", how can it be the attitude that the parties concerned should have?</p>
<p>The error in the athletics selection has become an undeniable fact. The resolution of the National Sports Association Board of Directors has become nothing more than "a piece of paper". The selection method and standards have completely overturned this resolution. With the rashness of a few people, and the "people" issue, without overall planning, it has led to the current great mistake. Now I want to analyze it item by item based on the facts. But I must state that I express my respect for the elected athletes and have no discrimination against them; I do not feel injustice for the unsuccessful athletes, and I do not particularly promote them; I have no evil intentions in aiming at the authorities; I am completely making a whole review based on the situation unfolding before us.</p>
<p>(One)</p>
<p>According to the legal publication of the National Sports Association - "Sports Quarterly" Volume 2, Issue 1: "Item 4 of the Second Meeting Record of the Third Board of Directors on January 27, 25: Appoint and retroactively recognize the list of selection committee members for various sports participating in the World Games, and set the selection principles as follows: good character, excellent performance, younger age and hope for training. Athletics and swimming selection committee members: John Ma (convener), Rong Qizhao, Zhou Jiaqi, ... Also set the pre-selection performance standards for participation."</p>
<p>There are three athletics and swimming selection committee members. Rong Qizhao has led the Chinese football team abroad, and Zhou Jiaqi has also gone abroad earlier to meet the football team fighting in Java and then go to Germany to arrange everything. Only John Ma is still in the country and is responsible for the athletics selection and training. After Rong and Zhou went abroad, no announcement of the personnel acting for the athletics selection committee was seen. So, is this selection matter entirely presided over by Mr. Ma alone? Or jointly responsible by other officials of the National Sports Association? Why not announce it in advance?</p>
<p>(Two)</p>
<p>According to the National Sports Association's same issue of the Sports Quarterly: "Table of Pre-Selection Athletics Performance Standards for Participating in the World Games", a comparison is made with the pre-selection performance as follows:</p>
<p>(Note: ×The first place in the 200-meter race was British Bowan, with a score of 22.7 seconds, dropping Liu by 56 meters. At that time, because Liu was the second place and there was no definite time to announce. According to Jiang Xiangqing's "Criticism of Athletics Selection" article in the 11th Times News, it was 23.4 seconds)</p>
<p>The above table does not have the pre-selection standards for the ten-item event and the marathon. That is, there was no by-election in the order of the pre-selection day. Then, there is no doubt that these two items are scheduled not to send athletes. Until the day of confrontation, suddenly the radio broadcasted the test of the ten-item event; without announcing it and without explaining it, what reason can be used to say that sending athletes for the ten-item event is legitimate? What reason can be used to say that sending marathon athletes is not illegal? Moreover, among the currently announced athletes, whether their scores have met the standard scores, participating in the pre-selection, they still have to meet the standard scores, then the performance standard for selecting World Games athletes must at least reach the pre-selection standard, and it is ironclad that it should surpass this pre-selection standard.</p>
<p>There is also a table of pre-selection standard scores for participation, and the standards set are as follows:</p>
<p>There are pre-selection standard scores for women, and a total of nine people were reported to participate in the women's pre-selection. Except for Li Sen, the others did not participate. They gave up on their own. Why did Mr. John Ma, the convener of the athletics selection committee, give a speech to the newspaper reporters, saying that "As for women's sports, I have always advocated it very much, but in view of the performance and physiological protection, participating in the World Games seems too early." (This talk can be found in Shanghai newspapers on June 6) Since the women's pre-selection standards have been set, this is of course wanting to send female athletes; and why did Mr. Ma say "Participating in the World Games seems too early"? Therefore, the absence of the female athletes who signed up for the pre-selection can be said to be all because of Mr. Ma's words. However, since women's participation in the World Games is too early, why send a female athlete to participate? How is this explained?</p>
<p>(Three)</p>
<p>Since the pre-selection performance standards and selection principles have been announced, of course, they must be followed according to the announced intention. The number of people selected is twelve. Since the end of the training class in Beiping and after the end, Mr. John Ma and Liu Changchun (captain of the training class) have repeatedly stated that they want to increase the number of people selected to sixteen. When Liu arrived in Shanghai, he also stated to the newspaper reporters. There was nothing wrong with increasing the number to sixteen, but the National Sports Association did not formally announce it. Until the announcement of the selected candidates, it did increase to sixteen. Moreover, there are representatives sent for the programs that are not in the pre-selection order, and those who did not meet the pre-selection standard scores were also selected, and several people with pre-selection standard scores were also not selected; this inconsistency between words and deeds fundamentally overturned the selection standards, which is contrary to the principle of "administration." Could it be that the leaders of the national sports world can be so negligent about such a big thing?</p>
<p>(Four)</p>
<p>Now I want to talk about the issue of Zhang Lingjia, the representative of the ten-item event. After this issue was pointed out, Mr. John Ma immediately gave an explanation. He said: "... Zhang Lingjia, the representative of the ten-item event, is considered to be improperly selected by the outside world. I don't know that Mr. Zhang's spirit of hard work is very good, and he has a good understanding of psychology. Our country is participating in the World Games this time for observation purposes, and participating in ten items will benefit more. And Mr. Zhang has decided to serve the sports world after returning to China..." We do not object to sending representatives for the ten-item event, but why not announce it in advance to give others the same opportunity? Moreover, does Mr. Zhang's performance meet the principle of "excellent performance"? Mr. Zhang's "spirit of hard work is very good... After returning to China, he has decided to serve the sports world." In order to improve performance, who does not have this spirit of hard work? Who can say that he has decided not to serve the sports world after returning to China? This is very illogical. Moreover, Mr. Zhang's sports era has passed. He is neither "younger in age" nor "excellent in performance". According to Dong Yinchu's "Question" Item 3 "Zhang Lingjia, a ten-item athlete, is listed as an assistant teacher in the Department of Physical Education on the Tsinghua University list. Does this conflict with the amateur qualifications?" (See the 17th Times News) Since Mr. Dong discovered that Zhang was an assistant teacher in the Department of Physical Education on the Tsinghua University list, it is presumably not a fabricated slander. If so, he is no longer an amateur athlete. Then the so-called "spirit of hard work" and "After returning to China, he has decided to serve the sports world" and "Participating in ten items will benefit more" have logical fallacies, which is very obvious. The matter concerns the national face and must not be played with negligence. Given this, all the debates about Zhang Lingjia, the athlete of the ten-item event, should be completely overturned, and Mr. Zhang's right to represent should be revoked immediately. The amateur style of football has been enough, and we do not want athletics to have such a shameful thing again. Moreover, John Ma also talked about the issue of Li Huitang. He said: "The Li Huitang incident concerns the national face, and it is advocated to investigate it strictly"; we should ask Mr. Ma to lead by example and "strictly investigate" Zhang Lingjia's qualifications first.</p>
<p>(Five)</p>
<p>As Mr. Ma said, "Mr. Zhang's spirit of hard work is very good" and "After returning to China, he has decided to serve the sports world", I should add one more sentence "Mr. Zhang's character is good". Mr. Zhang has a long sports life and indeed has the above-mentioned virtues. He can indeed make considerable contributions in the sports world; this time, our country should definitely give him an opportunity to participate in the World Games; but he should not be illegally selected as a representative for the ten-item event. Why not send him to the inspection team?</p>
<p>We hope that the sixteen athletes should be strictly reviewed, and at least those who meet the pre-selection standard scores are qualified to represent China to participate in the World Games. If the funding is sufficient, it is possible to organize a "sightseeing tour" for all the lagging athletes who are not far from the pre-selection standard scores and who meet the three principles of selection, and accompany them to Germany for sightseeing, which can also gain some technical and construction knowledge. Or give those who have deeper qualifications and seem unable to continue exercising, such as Liu Changchun, Zhang Lingjia, and Hao Chunde, etc., and do not want them to continue exercising in the future. Give them the title of "coach" with a clear conscience and give them the opportunity to participate in the World Games, hoping that they will honestly be instructors after returning to China.</p>
<p>It is not a smart way to blame the error in selection; it is not bright to advocate for a certain unsuccessful athlete; the authorities' persistence and failure to empathize, and failure to plan good policies, is not an attitude that the highest sports authorities and leaders in the country should have; I hope to seek an irresistible compromise based on the above-mentioned fifth point.

<h3 id="e167">Finance: Market Sentiment Weak; Gold Standard Continues Downward <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The gold market struggled yesterday due to the continued decline in the benchmark gold price. With the swap period approaching, although there were many foreign buyers in the market, the settlement price was only 26.6 yuan, a difference of more than 10 yuan. The short sellers have no intention of settling, so they must wait until the end of the period. Otherwise, this swap will undoubtedly favor the short sellers. As a result, market sentiment was quite loose, leading to poor performance. In the morning, overseas silver markets saw London rising and the US holding steady. Forward silver prices rose by 5 to 20 basis points. Exchange rates remained high. London spot gold shrank by 2 pence. The Central Bank's official rates were announced, with both the British and US rates remaining unchanged. Customs gold unit fell by 2 basis points. The standard gold price fell to 1126.6 yuan. Over-the-counter preparatory trading opened at 38.00 yuan. Fuxing, Yongyuan, and Qianyichang took advantage of the low prices and moved up to 9 yuan. Dadecheng was still selling. The morning opening was slightly lower, but stabilized. The HSBC bank announced its official rates, with both British and US rates unchanged. At this time, the market stabilized somewhat due to Qianyuan's continued advances. However, selling pressure increased, ultimately leading to a decline. Although the silver balance tax did not move, there was a slight pullback. Later, due to the strengthening of the exchange rate, long positions were shaken and declined again. However, due to the continued strong buying interest from Qianyuan and others, the market managed to level off at noon. July contracts increased to over 15,000 lots. The July-August spread will begin next Monday, and it is predicted that the longs will pay around 5 yuan. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1138.8 yuan, down 0.2 yuan from the previous close. Fuxing, Yongyuan, Qianyichang, and Changxiang continued to buy, rising to 9.7 yuan. Dadecheng, Qiafeng, Shuiqing, Fayong supplied contracts at the high price. HSBC bank's rates were announced with British and US rates unchanged, and there were more buyers. Huixiang, Dadecheng, and Yicheng sold contracts, falling back to 8.1 yuan. Qianyuan and Daheng continued to buy, and the silver balance tax remained unchanged, rebounding to 8.8 yuan. Yicheng, Tongyi, Dadecheng, Dafa, and Yongzai sold again, falling to 7.7 yuan. Qianyuan, Chunyuan, and Yong maintained, rising to 8.4 yuan. The noon close was 1138.2 yuan.</p>
<p>The settlement price, based on the Central Bank's standard gold price, fell to 1126.6 yuan. In terms of the closing price, it was approximately 20 yuan weaker, a gain of about 1 yuan from the previous close. The registration for this month is 1134 yuan, and for July is 1138 yuan. The morning water supplement was 1134 yuan, with gold also increasing by 12 yuan, to 1150.8 yuan. The spot market remained stable, with Tianjin goods and 焓赤 both increasing by 15 yuan, with demand exceeding supply. There are still 336 contracts remaining for this month.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was relatively flat. In total, Qianyuan, Hengchang, Yongyuan, Changyong, Chunyuan, Yongdaheng, Fuyu, Hongkangyong, etc. were on the buying side. Fuxingyong, Dafayong, Shunfayong, Dadecheng, Shendayong, Qingfayong, Qiafengyong, Tongtaichang, Wumao, Yonghengyu, Yuxinxiang, etc. were on the selling side.</p>
<p>The market struggled in the first half of the day. The morning opening was 1138.8 yuan, and the noon close was 1138.3 yuan. The highest was 1139.7 yuan, and the lowest was 1137.7 yuan, with a fluctuation of 2.7 yuan. The result was a decrease of 0.7 yuan from the previous close. The total number of transactions was 7,119 contracts in the morning session.</p>
<p>July's line-up: On the long side, Qianyuan has 2,100 lots, Wanxing over 900, Tongtaichang, Hengchang, and Yongdaheng each have over 700, Yingxiang, Yuxinxiang, and Wuchangxiang each have over 600, Chunyuan, Yongyu, Qingyongjiu, and Da each have over 500, Xiangfeng over 400, Juda and Fuda each have over 300, Shunli and Xianghe each have over 200, Dacheng, Huixiang, Jinfeng, Yongrunchang, Yongfuyu, Futaiyong, Bingxingyong, Deyishengyongheng, etc. each have over 100.

<p>The exchange market yesterday was characterized by persistent long positions in foreign exchange, leading to a mixed performance. The British pound remained flat, while the US dollar weakened slightly. Early morning overseas telegraphs indicated that the London market saw the pound rise to nearly 0.0625 for spot rates and 0.125 for forward rates. There were also reports that Indian buyers continued to purchase pounds after the market closed. The New York silver market was stable, while London forward silver prices rose by 0.005 to 0.02. London spot gold fell by 2.5 pence. The pound strengthened by 0.01 against the US dollar and rose by 15 points against the French franc. The US dollar was long at 0.05625 against the pound and short at 0.0625 against the French franc. The central exchange rate postings were unchanged for both the British pound and the US dollar, while the customs gold unit weakened. The exchange market opened in the morning with the near-term selling rate for the British pound at 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 73125, and the US dollar at 30.0625 yuan. These rates were flat compared to the previous close for both currencies. There was some interbank trading after the opening, but the market remained stable. Later, banks showed mixed activity. The HSBC bank kept its posted rates for both the British pound and the US dollar, as well as silver, unchanged, and the stamp duty remained the same. During this period, interbank trading was still prevalent, with many offers circulating. Subsequently, banks began to sell off, and while Chinese merchants were buying, the market gradually loosened. At the midday close, the near-term selling rate for the British pound was 1 shilling and 2 pence 375, and the US dollar was 30.09375 yuan, reflecting a flat British pound and a loosening US dollar by 0.03125 compared to the previous close. Forward rates for both the British pound and the US dollar were up by 0.0625. Chinese merchants bought approximately 100,000 US dollars. The transactions for the first half of the day are recorded below.</p>
<p>The British pound opened in the morning with a near-term selling rate of 1 shilling and 2 pence 375. Eastern sold to HSBC, and Mitsui sold to the British Bank, with matching trades for June at 3125 and 375. Chartered sold to Sin Fung spot at 375. Yokohama Specie Bank covered for September at 125. China Communications Bank sold to foreign firms spot at 375. The closing selling rates were spot at 1 shilling and 2 pence 375, June at 325, July at 25, August at 1875, and September at 125.

<p>The US dollar opened in the morning with a near-term selling rate of 30.0625 yuan. Citibank covered for September at 4375. Shanghai sold to Chartered for August at 625.

<h3 id="e169">Securities: Short Covering Drives Slight Rise in Long Positions <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Government Bonds Rise Again</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, due to the lack of new developments in the political situation, short covering and long position rollovers occurred simultaneously, coupled with slight upward pressure from large long position holders. Sellers showed some signs of withdrawing, and the market turned higher. However, while the door to peace is not entirely closed, it is also not advisable to be overly optimistic about the current situation. The overall trend yesterday was a gradual upward climb. The most active buyers were firms 4 and 35, followed by 11, 21, 30, 34, and 35 (using 77). Retail investors were also active. The largest sellers were firms 1 and 47, while others such as 37 and 48 also sold. Due to the significant difference between the quantity of incoming and outgoing orders, the opening price was good by 0.03 to 0.06, and the second trade was good by 0.02 to 0.03. However, Class A and B securities were slightly weak. The afternoon opening continued to rise by 0.02 to 0.03 to 0.5 yuan, and the closing gains were strong, improving by another 0.1 to 0.35 yuan. This reflects the dull political situation, anxious public sentiment, and the upcoming weekend break, leading to temporary short covering. With many changes ahead and the June settlement approaching, holding long positions is not yet the opportune time. The final market prices showed an overall increase of 0.55 to 1.25 yuan. The total transaction volume was 10.01 million yuan. A table comparing the gains and losses is listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3 id="e170">Yarn and Cotton: Spot Sales Remain Strong, Speculation in Marked Yarn Continues Unabated <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market has retreated, making it difficult to grasp its direction. Market sentiment is divided. Due to the Guangdong-Guangxi incident, some are inclined to sell, but overseas yarn and cotton conditions remain firm. In the spot yarn market, buyers from Sichuan and Hunan are actively purchasing, and there are also those who are taking long positions. However, it is rumored that some long position holders may deliver this month.</p>
<p>Marked Yarn Falls by Around One Yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the marked yarn market, prices for all months showed a downward trend. Due to peace in the external cotton market, and the military news from Guangdong and Guangxi, market sentiment softened. Hop Yih and Yuen Hong, who held substantial long positions, moved to liquidate. As a result, all months fell by 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. At the afternoon opening, there were reports that spot yarn transactions were still manageable. Buyers from Sichuan and Changsha were still actively purchasing spot yarn, and market sentiment improved slightly, with floating long positions covering. As a result, all months rose by 0.1, 0.4, and 0.5 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was noted that Mei Kee sold 700 bales, Da Fu 750 bales, Hop Yih 5,850 bales, Yuan Yi 600 bales, Yih Sing 850 bales, Yuen Hong 2,250 bales, Sin Cheng 1,050 bales, Kwong Fung 500 bales, and Dat Kee 500 bales. Buyers included Cheng Kee 650 bales, Yue Tai 1,950 bales, Hing Chong 1,350 bales, Da Chang Cheng 950 bales, Yih Chang 1,000 bales, Cheung Fung 1,600 bales, Chun Hong 1,015 bales, Ming Wah 500 bales, and Cheung Yue 550 bales. The highest and lowest prices of the day, as well as the closing prices, are listed below, with the number of bales in inventory.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market remains good, with a total of 1,110 bales purchased by various firms. The selling prices varied. The purchase amounts by various firms are as follows:</p>
<p>Tianjin 110, Changsha 455, Weihaiwei 1100, Hankou 40, Sichuan 455, Inland 195, Jiangxi 145, Xiamen 5, Anqing 10, Counterparties 110.</p>

<p>Rumors Suggest Some Long Positions May Deliver This Month</p>
<p>The cotton market has turned weak, with signs of falling prices. However, Xin Hua is relatively firm due to the strength of the US and Indian cotton markets. Sellers are scarce. But there is a rumor that long positions in old cotton not only have no intention of taking delivery this month but are actually considering delivering, which is putting heavy pressure on the market. The market sentiment is extremely weak. At the opening of the marked cotton market, US cotton, which had risen the previous day, turned flat, falling by 0.01 to 0.02 pounds. However, Indian cotton rose by 1.5 to 3.5 rupees. Osaka Sanpin cotton fell by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Market sentiment is mediocre, and the marked money has fallen back. The situation this month is very weak, with all months falling unanimously by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. However, new cotton is more expensive. At the afternoon opening, the momentum was weak, and the near-term situation remained weak. As a result, all months fell by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan compared to the morning closing price, and new cotton fell by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. It was noted that Ruey Yih sold 2,100 piculs, Shen Chang 2,300 piculs, Da Fu 2,900 piculs, Da Fung 2,500 piculs, Hop Hing 7,600 piculs, King Fung 1,600 piculs, Cheung Yue 1,400 piculs, Yuen Hong 2,700 piculs, Jing Hua 3,200 piculs, Sin Cheng 2,000 piculs, Yih Hong 2,800 piculs, Juey Hing 6,900 piculs, Chun Da 1,200 piculs, Yan Fung 2,600 piculs, Yuan Yi 2,100 piculs, Yih Cheng 1,700 piculs, Da Chang Cheng 5,500 piculs, Sheng Yuen 2,000 piculs, Cheung 3,400 piculs, Cheung Fung 3,900 piculs, and Chun Hong 1,400 piculs. The highest and lowest prices of the day, as well as the closing prices, are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption has slowed, and factory demand is slightly lower. The source is 850 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Stripped Cotton 58.25, Yu Feng Factory purchased 110 pieces, spot delivered to the factory.</p>

<p>British and Indian Cotton Remain Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the opening of US cotton trading, mainland and local sellers took profits, leading to fluctuations of 0.02 pounds in prices for all months. However, these sales were absorbed by counterparties and Liverpool. At the same time, brokers had renewed demand, pushing prices to new highs. Spot demand was very good. H. Hentz estimated weekly factory consumption at 187,000 bales, and Liverpool inventory at 307,000 bales. Subsequently, the market calmed down, and the closing was firm. Spot prices rose by 0.01 pounds, and futures prices fluctuated by 0.01 to 0.02 pounds. British cotton spot prices rose by 6 points, and futures prices rose by 5 to 6 points. Indian cotton was initially firm due to good overseas news, but later short covering and purchases by European exporters, coupled with large-scale profit-taking, led to price fluctuations. Spot prices rose by 1 to 3 rupees for both Pingguo and Aomula, and by 1.52 rupees. The original telegram records are on the left (dated the 12th).</p>
<p>According to a Bombay telegram dated the 13th, the opening forecast for White Raw Cotton was 216 rupees, down 0.75 rupees from the previous day.</p>

<p>The Best Sales are to Sichuan and Along the Yangtze River</p>
<p>Although marked yarn and cotton prices fell across the board yesterday, overseas raw cotton remained quite firm. Japanese firms have completely sold out their daily quota, and Chinese yarn factories are also releasing large quantities of coarse and fine cloth. The market is quite prosperous. All factories have no intention of selling white goods for the next month because new cotton is expensive, and there is very little certainty. The volume of sales to different regions varies greatly. Sales to Sichuan, the hinterland, and the Changzhou area are the most vibrant. The Sichuan region buys from both domestic and foreign factories, including the "Four Gentlemen" (textile companies), Hongzhang, Huayang, Mei Heng, and Hui Mie, as well as Xin Ni (yarn), and Ren Fung, Guanghua factory's "Shi Lin" cloth. The counties of Luzhou, Anqing, and Wuhu in Anhui province also buy fabric from Da Cheng, Xie Fung, and Ri Xin factories. Jiangxi province, especially Nanchang, buys large quantities of the factory’s cotton prints, foreign yarns, fine serge, patterned and plain silk fabrics, fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth in an endless stream. Hunan province is gradually reducing its purchases of large quantities of domestically produced patterned and plain cotton cloth for shipment to Japan. Purchases by the hinterland and local buyers include over ten cases each of Jardine Matheson white and bleached cloth, thirty to forty bales of heavy-weight coarse cloth, and about two hundred bales of light-weight coarse cloth. Demand for Dong brand fine cloth is slightly weaker because prices are already high.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Grains: New Wheat Arrives: Floating Long Positions Liquidate, Flour and Wheat Prices Fall <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The flour market unexpectedly reversed course yesterday, with a sharp decline no less dramatic than the previous surge. Although the near-term market had briefly rebounded, it subsequently stabilized due to market rumors of an easing situation within the Customs. Market sentiment among industry insiders and outsiders alike calmed down. Floating long positions were the first to liquidate, and large players also seized the opportunity to sell. Speculators and retailers were even more active. The previous surge was mainly driven by the political situation and public sentiment, and there was no real demand. Now that the political situation has stabilized and large players are selling, the high prices have no support, and the market has immediately reversed course. The near-term market once fell to 3.2 yuan, and the decline in the far-term market was even more significant than in the near-term market due to competition from various parties. Large players are still holding on in the near-term market, so the decline is slower, but it is still less than 0.3 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The far-term market is down by 0.04 to 0.05 yuan.</p>
<p>The wheat market opened yesterday morning, already affected by the easing political situation and reports of lower prices for foreign wheat. News spread that new wheat was being shipped from various locations, and overseas and local players immediately rushed to liquidate. New short positions and traders were all eager to sell. The near-term market once fell to 4.33 yuan, down 0.12 yuan from the previous high. In the afternoon, short covering led to some stabilization, but selling pressure remained strong for both near-term and far-term months, causing prices to fall by varying degrees of 0.06 to 0.07 yuan and 0.04 to 0.05 yuan. Currently, the supply of new wheat is still scarce, and prices may not fall sharply immediately. However, the market is expected to change when the supply of new wheat becomes abundant. Yesterday, only 300 bags of Kunshan wheat arrived, purchased by Fu Xin at a price of 4.25 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Sales of Keh Hsien Rice are Strong <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the supply of Keh Hsien rice gradually increased due to the active market in Shanghai, attracting sources from various ports. Shipments of eastern and western rice were relatively large. However, sales in this area were the strongest, with Fujian and Zhejiang buyers and retailers showing strong interest. Buyers in this area and from Fujian prefer high-quality rice and those above the middle grade, while buyers from Zhejiang and inland rural areas still prefer medium and lower-grade rice. High and low grades are both active, and the market appears to be slightly bullish. If Keh Hsien rice sales continue to be strong, prices may rise again. A total of 8,130 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,500 bags of Hunan rice, 720 bags of Taiwanese rice, 1,700 bags of Jiangbei rice, and 329 bags of Anqing and Nanjing rice were sold. Most of the sales were in this area.</p>

<p>(Li Nan) Yesterday, the total supply from various sources reached 16 or 17 shipments (more than 3,000 bags), mostly Borda rice. Although sales in this area were average, the 1,000 bags of Borda rice purchased by buyers from Dalian and Qinhuangdao, as well as the 200 to 300 bags of thick Geng rice, helped maintain the price of both thick Geng rice and Borda rice. The supply and demand for Doo Fei Jian and Yin Bian Wu rice were similar, and the market remained stable.</p>
<p>(Yuan Bei) Yesterday, the supply from various sources downstream reached about 20 shipments. Sales of white Geng rice in the market have slowed, and prices are slightly tight. The prices of Yin Bian Yuan Yang Doo Bu Jian and other varieties remained similar to before.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Ideals and Realization and its success <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>—Children Must Possess a Doer's Spirit—</p>
<p>In this publication. More than a dozen children have published the major question of "What will I be when I grow up?" Indeed, it is urgently needed to be examined, especially for ordinary children, who should pay attention to their own personal problems, so as to contribute to the country. After reading the aspirations of many children, I am very pleased. Some want to study science; some want to be great engineers; some want to be battlefield nurses; some want to run educational undertakings; These kinds of grand aspirations are indeed capable of saving the country and the people, and creating immeasurable blessings.</p>
<p>Our current ideal is the basis for future practice. Everyone at the end of the century has ideals, but success is very rare. What is the reason for this? It is the lack of a spirit of doing, working hard, and striving hard.</p>
<p>For example, if someone is called A to do something, but A does it carelessly and vaguely, and does not do it practically, of course it will not be good or successful. Also calling B to do it, initially very serious and practical, but encounters difficulties and cannot endure hardship, so give up halfway and do not go back to it. Also calling C to do it, is much better than A and B, and can break through these two difficulties, but when it is about to succeed, others say, "This thing will never succeed, what are you doing it for?" C becomes discouraged and does not continue. A failed because he did not do it practically, B failed because he lacked the spirit of working hard, and C failed because he lacked a strong will, so none of them succeeded.</p>
<p>Children! In the past, many people had this kind of aspiration, but how many succeeded? I hope you will quickly cultivate yourselves, so that you can achieve your own grand aspirations.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Wen Tianxiang in his Childhood <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>In Luling County, Jiangxi Province, there is an ancestral hall in the school palace, which is dedicated to the great figures in the local area, such as Ouyang Wenzhong, Yang Zhongxiang, Hu Zhongjian, and Zhou Wenzhong, also known as the Ancestral Hall of the Four Gentlemen.</p>
<p>One day, Wen Tianxiang (who was not yet ten years old at the time), went to the ancestral hall to play, looking around, and listening to people saying that they were local sages, and he admired them very much! He said with emotion: "After I die in the future, I will not enjoy being worshipped in this ancestral hall like them, this is not a real great man!" Children, think about it, he had such a big ambition at such a young age. Naturally, it goes without saying that his father loved him very much. As the saying goes: "No one knows a son better than his father", and it is also said that "fathers hope their sons become dragons." Anyone would be happy to have this descendant, let alone his own father.</p>
<p>Sure enough, when he grew up, he did a lot of earth-shattering things for the Song Dynasty, trying to restore the Han Chinese state, and desperately resisting the Yuan soldiers, but the result was unfavorable, and he was captured. The Yuan Dynasty treated him especially well, wanting him to surrender. Emperor Yuan Shizu also persuaded him, and even asked him to be the prime minister, but he refused to the death. Like him, who supported the country, and like him, with such a spirit of patriotism, - he was not a loyal subject to a single family, he was indeed a patriot who supported the country and promoted the nation's ambitions. This spirit is a national revival pill. In short: His great personality is not only admirable and commendable, but also a model figure for children!</p>
<h3 id="e187">Living and Non-Living Things <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Every morning, Min'er always goes to his family's garden alone to breathe some fresh air. The trees in the garden are already lush, looking out, a patch of lush green colors, which makes people pleasing to the eye, so he loves the trees very much, but he remembers his brother once said that those trees are living things, and they don't move at all, how can they be called living things?</p>
<p>"Brother, didn't you say that trees are living things the other day? How do you know that?"</p>
<p>"Yes, trees are living things. Why are they living things? Then we must compare them with non-living things to understand. Otherwise, it is too unfocused. There are many differences between living and non-living things: The material that makes up living things is extremely small cells, so small that we can't see them with the naked eye. They must be magnified under a microscope to see clearly. But non-living things do not have this. Living things always need to eat food, because food contains energy, and with energy, they can move, but part of the food is absorbed, so on the one hand, they need other food to replenish. If there is no food to replenish, will they not starve to death? You have never seen a stone eat food, because stone is a non-living thing and does not need it. Living things can grow, like a tree that can gradually grow up, but what about non-living ice? How can ice break a vase? Because water expands when it freezes, but this expansion is not growth, it can only increase in volume but will not grow. Living things can not only grow, but also produce small living things that look like themselves at a certain time. Non-living things cannot do this. If there is a stimulus from the outside, living things will respond to this stimulus and produce various movements. For example, if you hit a dog, the force of hitting it is the external stimulus. You see, that thing will definitely run away quickly, and that running away is a movement. Do you think non-living things can do this? Living things will die after a certain period of time, and trees will wither and die, but non-living things do not have the phenomenon of death. With such a comparison, you can know the differences between living and non-living things.</p>

<h3 id="e189">The Largest Electromagnet of Modern Times <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Xun</p>
<p>Electromagnets can pick up iron objects. All of you children who have played with magnets know this! I think that children who play with magnets must have had this ideal: if small magnets can attract small iron objects, then if we make a large one, wouldn't we be able to attract all the enemy's weapons during war? Isn't that right?</p>
<p>The largest electromagnet in modern times weighs 1720 pounds. Its diameter is five feet two inches; its job is to lift and unload iron objects. It can lift 70,000 pounds of single, flat iron sheets. The picture shows the situation of a military magnet crane loading large pieces of iron into a freight car; it can load an average of 4,000 pounds each time!</p>
<p>This large magnet is entirely made of many thin copper sheets, wrapped on the outside with asbestos tape, and each coil is wrapped to act as a rope edge. Its movement is controlled by electric current.</p>
<p>As for the first electromagnet, it was made in 1828 by the American Jcseph Henry in Princetron; that electromagnet was U-shaped, made by bending an iron rod, and wrapped with many metal windings, the surroundings of which were wrapped with silk strips to serve as rope edges. (See left picture)</p>
<h3 id="e190">"The Last Lesson" <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yuqing</p>
<p>Children! Perhaps you are unfamiliar with the term "The Last Lesson"? Now I will give you a general explanation.</p>
<p>"The Last Lesson" was originally a short story written by the French writer Daudet. The story is about: during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, when the Prussian army invaded French territory, a French elementary school held "The Last Lesson" under enemy rule. But why is it "The Last Lesson"? Because after the enemy's fierce arrival, not only was the land annexed, but even the schools were taken over. So today a French teacher is teaching, and tomorrow an enemy teacher will come to teach! Today they are teaching French, and tomorrow they will be teaching Prussian! Today the teacher teaches the children to love France, but tomorrow the teacher will teach the children to love Prussia, recognizing the enemies who invade and oppress them as kind and loving protective envoys. The teacher solemnly finished this "Last Lesson." He was so heartbroken that he shed tears, and the students were also so moved that they burst into tears. Children, what a painful story this is!</p>
<p>But why is this story being brought to China now? Needless to say, it is because the national crisis is becoming more and more urgent, and the enemy army is driving straight in. Therefore, some people have borrowed the words "The Last Lesson," which is very appropriate.</p>
<p>Children! However, you don't need to resent, be ashamed, or even belittle yourselves just because you are overwhelmed by patriotic fervor. Why do I say this? Precisely because I have encountered children several times who have spoken to me in a tone that is resentful, ashamed, and belittling: "I only resent that I was born too young to follow the university students and middle school students to do national salvation work. Isn't this in vain for being Chinese? I am really ashamed! Alas! Children are too useless!" But, children! You must understand that saving the country does not rely on a moment's fervor, but on perseverance. The future of China needs you, the masters of the country!</p>
<h3 id="e191">Summer Hygiene <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Zong Lin</p>
<p>Recently, I have heard many doctors predict that Shanghai will have another epidemic year this year. Indeed, recalling this season four years ago, Shanghai experienced an epidemic. Many people died at that time, but fortunately, it was extinguished in a proper manner, so it did not spread.</p>
<p>Children! Do you still have that tragic scene imprinted in your minds? Do you feel scared? Maybe you will nod your heads to express your shock. But what's the use of just being afraid? We must take precautions to avoid the invasion of "seasonal diseases." The following are a few points that I want to contribute to you.</p>
<p>(1) Get Vaccinated. Each of you must have a "foresight" mentality and ask a doctor to inject you with a vaccine as early as possible to increase your resistance to disease and reduce your summer worries about the epidemic.</p>
<p>(2) Keep Your Home Clean. The rent in Shanghai is indeed surprisingly expensive! Most people cannot afford spacious housing. This is also one of the special circumstances of the city. Leaving aside the children who live in high-rise buildings, if you live in a pigeon-cage-like house every day because of the above situation, then, although the house is small, it is not very important. As long as the air is circulating, the dirt is removed, the appliances are adjusted, and mosquitoes and flies are eliminated, and everything is done thoroughly, you can also reduce the risk of being surrounded by disease.</p>
<p>(3) Be Careful About Your Diet. In addition to doing the first two things, we must also pay great attention to being careful about our diet. As the saying goes, "Disease enters through the mouth," which is true. If you don't pay attention to hygiene in your diet, disease will easily come to your door. Rotten food and things from street vendors are best not to buy at all. Because food is not clean, it often has bacteria, and I don't know how many thousands or tens of thousands of them are parasitic on it. Just think about it, how dangerous this is! So, for the sake of life safety, you must be careful about being clean in your diet.</p>
<p>Children! You are all the future masters of China. Now, in addition to enriching your studies, you must also exercise your bodies. Summer has arrived, and summer hygiene must first be paid attention to!</p>
<h3 id="e192">Proof of the Round Earth <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu</p>
<p>The sun goes down in the west, slowly disappearing: the ground changes from pale yellow to twilight. Do you think the entire earth is shrouded in darkness? No: one half of the earth is experiencing night, and the opposite half is experiencing day.</p>
<p>The sun hangs high in the sky, shining on all directions. The Earth is round and constantly rotating there. The side facing the sun is day; the side facing away from the sun is night.</p>
<p>If you take a flight and rise 10,000 feet above the ground, you can see the sun set ten minutes later than on the ground.</p>
<p>The situation with the sun rising is the same. If you take a plane before sunrise and rise to a height of two miles above the ground, you can see the sun rise ten minutes earlier than on the ground.</p>
<p>The principle is the same as seeing the sunrise earlier and the sunset later on top of a high mountain than on the ground. This is clear evidence of the round earth.</p>
<p>The evidence of the round earth can also be explained by the different times in the east and west. In the east where we live, we see the sun earlier every day. For example, the time in Tokyo is a little more than an hour earlier than Shanghai; Honolulu is more than two hours earlier than Shanghai. In the west where we live, we see the sun later every day. For example, the time in Chengdu is a little more than an hour later than Shanghai; Yining in Xinjiang is two and a half hours later than Shanghai.</p>
<p>This is a simple and interesting proof of the round earth.</p>

<p>Boy Scout brothers and sisters across the country! Long time no see. We believe that some readers, when they see our signature, will have an interesting memory from their Boy Scout life! That's right, in the past, we met many Boy Scout brothers from all over the place. Although we haven't had the opportunity to shake hands and chat happily, we have become close friends in spirit.</p>
<p>We have always hoped to have a few more gardens to give us more opportunities to stop, take a rest, and chat. In the past, we have opened such gardens in the Ta Kung Pao and Qingdao Morning Post; now we have even more enthusiastically gained the support of the editors of the Shen Bao "Children's Special Issue", who give us some valuable space every week. How happy and grateful should we be?</p>
<p>Here, we are willing to be your loyal friends and serve you sincerely. Here, you can ask questions, express opinions, and find new friends. Come on! Come on! We are willing to serve you!</p>
<p>Please pay special attention: we are willing to be lifelong friends with the children who write to us, so as long as you are not afraid of trouble, we are always prepared to chat with you for a long time. Although sometimes your questions may not be published here publicly—because many questions are limited to individuals, are not very important, or have already been answered publicly—we will still give you a satisfactory answer directly.</p>
<p>In addition, for children who are not yet Boy Scouts, we also welcome them to join.</p>
<p>We would like to dedicate this small "mailbox" to the 170,000 Boy Scout brothers across the country, and even more willing to dedicate it to all the children of the Republic of China at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Children who correspond, please follow the following guidelines:</p>
<p>Send your letters directly to: "China Boy Scout Self-Help Society, c/o Boy Scout Corps, Guangji Righteous School, Fude Lane, North Sichuan Road, Shanghai"</p>
<p>The questions in your letters should be as simple as possible.</p>
<p>Those who want to be introduced to friends must specify what kind of friends they want to make.</p>
<p>We also welcome children to discuss with us any opinions they have about Boy Scouting.</p>
<p>For the first correspondence, please write down the following points in detail: A. Name, native place, age; B. The China Boy Scout Troop × Team (or School) to which you belong (non-Boy Scouts do not need to write);</p>
<p>C. Qualification: elementary, intermediate, or advanced.</p>
<p>D. Position: Troop Leader, Squad Leader, Deputy Squad Leader, or various officers, etc.</p>
<p>E. Mailing address,</p>
<p>F. Permanent mailing address (can be omitted if there is none)</p>
<p>For children who have already corresponded with us, just write down the number we gave you in the second letter. This number is for your use for life, and you can communicate with us in the future without writing your name.</p>
<p>Here, we plan not to publish the letters, but only to announce the names of the writers and our replies.</p>
<p>Because there are only three of us doing this (Zhao Bangqian, Chen Guangxiang, Zheng Wuzhang), and at the same time the space here cannot be expanded, so please forgive us if there is some delay in time. We will never let you down.</p>
<p>Please, children, please shout "All men are brothers"!</p>

<p>They walked to Antwerp with great difficulty. At that time, the clock was striking ten times. Little Nanlo thought to himself, "If I had something on my body to sell, then I could buy bread for Padereshi to eat!" However, he only had a thin cloth coat and a pair of wooden shoes, so where could he exchange for money?</p>
<p>Padereshi understood Little Nanlo's meaning very well, put his nose in Little Nanlo's hand, as if begging him not to care about his pain.</p>
<p>The results of the painting competition were to be announced at noon this day. The place where the announcements will be is in a public building. Little Nanlo went toward that place. On the stone steps of the house and in the vestibule of the entrance, there were a large group of young people gathered, some of whom were of the same age as him, and some of whom were a little older. They were all accompanied by their parents and relatives. Little Nanlo squeezed into them, feeling very scared, and pulled Padereshi closer to his own body. All the large clocks in the city struck twelve times loudly, reporting that noon had arrived. The door of the inner hall suddenly opened; the many young people who had been waiting eagerly rushed in, as it was said that the winning book was placed on a high wooden platform.</p>
<p>A heavy fog seemed to rise before Little Nanlo's eyes, covering his eyes. His head was dizzy, and his hands and feet seemed to be paralyzed. When his eyes were clear, he saw that the book placed on the high place was not his own work! At that moment, a commotion called out the name of the winner, he was called Stephen, the son of a wharf owner in Antwerp.</p>
<p>When Little Nanlo regained consciousness and slowly woke up, he was lying on the stone outside the door. Padereshi was guarding by his side and had used all kinds of methods to wake him up. A large group of young people shouted in the distance, celebrating the victory of their friend Stephen, and they all crowded around him and returned to his home.</p>

<p>The National Children's Painting Exhibition, after four or five months of preparation, officially opened on June 6. Such a grand children's book exhibition is the first in our country, so everything about the conference is worth reporting to the children who love to read this publication. The exhibition was initiated by the National Children's Year Implementation Committee. Because it was held at the Shanghai Municipal Stadium, it was also entrusted to five groups including the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau to be responsible for the preparations. They spent a lot of time and effort to have such a satisfactory harvest, so naturally they should be grateful.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the venue yesterday, there were thousands of children lined up to visit. Everyone felt very happy. One child said to the teacher, "We children can actually do so well and decorate such a big venue like a sky full of stars! Ah, the power of children is really great." A child wearing a green shirt said, "Mom! I love to see the works of children from the four northeastern provinces the most! It's a pity that the four northeastern provinces have been temporarily occupied by others. I don't know when they will be recovered!" A Boy Scout said, "Dad! Don't think that fine arts are not as good as science. Building houses requires drawings, building machines requires drawings, and building airplanes and cannons also requires drawings. The use of drawings is very important." I think their words all make sense.</p>
<p>The conference's products were based on provinces and cities as units, with a total of 28 units and a quantity of more than 30,000 pieces. Even remote provinces and regions had products. One-third of them were reviewed and selected. Among them, they were divided into eight groups: brush, pencil, colored pencil, watercolor, charcoal, pattern, etc. There were also more than 160 children who were wielding brushes in front of guests, painting very vividly. Some of them were from Chahar, and their spirit was truly admirable. This time, Shanghai had the largest number of participants, with more than 1,000 people, and Zhejiang had 1,500 people. Colored pencils were the most common, accounting for 42%, followed by watercolors, and pencils were the least common. Scenery was the most common theme, accounting for 40%, followed by people, and animals were the least common. The free surface works of children aged 14 to 10 were the most interesting. Many senior students expressed national ideas and had a strong patriotic spirit, but some were instructed or embellished by adults, which inevitably lost their pure creativity.</p>

<h3 id="e197">Review of Ms. Liu Wang Liming's "Waves of Life" <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Hu</p>
<p>——Published by the China Women's Production Cooperative, 205 Yuanmingyuan Road, priced at $1.20 per copy——</p>
<p>"Waves of Life" is a full-length novel that has just been published recently. Its author is Ms. Liu Wang Liming, whom we are familiar with. On the opposite page of this novel, we see these lines of poetry:</p>
<p>"Forward! Little boat of life, forward!</p>
<p>Do not fear the waves in the sea,</p>
<p>Do not fear the frightening waves in the river,</p>
<p>Throughout the ages, only the selfless,</p>
<p>Loyal, brave, and hardworking will triumph—</p>
<p>This is the law of creation,</p>
<p>This is our life."</p>
<p>At first glance, such lines of poetry seem very progressive, but upon careful consideration, they are extremely empty and devoid of any real content. Therefore, their meaning is also not definite: you can use it to express truly progressive ideas, or you can say it is a pleasant song for those who retreat; the so-called "loyalty," "courage," and "hard work," the so-called "selflessness," these words do not necessarily have progressive meaning, and their meaning must be judged by their specific content. If such lines of poetry can express the entire content of "Waves of Life," then in reality its specific content may not be progressive; the words "forward," "loyalty," and "courage" are just beautiful decorations.</p>
<p>First, in terms of the subject matter of this novel, it is merely the ordinary love life of young men and women. Although the author has raised many significant real-world issues in the construction and development of the story, these have not been portrayed as important themes, and of course, have not been accurately expressed; instead, they are raised incidentally and distortedly expressed. Naturally, the evaluation of literary works cannot be based solely on the subject matter, but the subject matter is closely related to the value of the work. If the value of a work must be determined by its power to move people, then works that artistically depict typical social phenomena that are deeply related to the majority of people should be the most valuable, because this can resonate deeply with the majority of people; as for personal trivial matters and special life experiences, they are of interest only to the individual and cannot generate empathy among the majority of people who live differently. Although "Waves of Life" was produced in the current turbulent era of China, it is not a depiction of the typical social phenomena of this era; it only expresses the experiences of a woman who rebels against arranged marriages in old families, especially her special love life: this is a fashionable theme since the "May Fourth" Movement; but because the "May Fourth" era has long passed, such a theme has already lost its progressive significance.</p>
<p>Looking at the ideological content of this novel again, the author first expresses a protest against the feudal parental arranged marriage system. She tells us that there is a young woman named Huang Muyun who ran away from home to resist arranged marriages, and at the same time, the young man Renbang, who was engaged to her, also left home because he was dissatisfied with the arranged marriage; later, after many twists and turns, they ingeniously fell in love freely and became husband and wife. In this way, although this young couple had simultaneously resisted arranged marriages, they eventually came together, but in form they always went through a period of resistance to the feudal family. Needless to say, this kind of thinking is also the thinking of the "May Fourth" era, which is already a thing of the past; but the author does not express even this kind of anti-feudal thinking of the "May Fourth" era very thoroughly: she does not use the opposite of this thinking to replace the old feudal thinking, but another form of virtuous doctrine. She strives to praise Huang Muyun, the heroine, for her obedience to her husband after marriage. In her writing, when Muyun discovers that her husband Renbang has fallen in love with someone else, and feels that such family life is tasteless, she leaves the family, but this is not "Nora's departure," nor is it a thorough rebellion against the ugly family life, but rather to promote the repentance of a husband who is unfaithful to her emotions; the fact is that after Muyun leaves home, although her husband is living with a romantic woman, and although she has another man who loves her very much asking for her hand, she remains absolutely faithful to her married husband, and as a result, her husband does repent and takes her back home. How much more progressive can you say that such a spirit of "loyalty" and "courage," such an idea of "remaining faithful to one's husband until death," such obedience to men, and such a doctrine of virtue are compared to those who completely obey parental arranged marriages? But this is precisely the theme of this novel, precisely the central idea of the author; the novel's Ms. Huang Muyun is precisely the author's incarnation.</p>
<p>"Waves of Life" was produced from the "×××" to the "×××" era, and the author also expresses the situation of these two major events in the middle. However, she initially adopts a satirical attitude, completely negating the debates among the masses caused by these two major events, and then openly expresses that the young couple Renbang and Muyun, whom she praises, are "rightists," advocating "studying hard and striving to become stronger." Readers certainly know whether this claim is correct based on past and present circumstances, and we do not need to say more. However, judging from this point alone, we can also know what the author's position is in the current national liberation movement.</p>
<p>In this novel, the author also expresses the suffering of the hard-working, and many dark sides of society, but this is not to arouse everyone's resistance and seek liberation with their own strength, but to promote Christian dogma, to ask people to believe in God, to promote universal love, and to encourage people to donate money to run religious charities. The heroine Huang Muyun, portrayed by the author, is a Christian. She is enthusiastic about charity, has the spirit of "sacrificing for the cause," and has extreme faith in God. As long as there are any disasters or pains, "Indeed, heaven and man are in harmony, the wind and waves subside, and the radiance of the sun slowly shoots out from the clouds." Reading this novel cannot help but remind us of Tolstoy. This great genius writer did his best to expose the hypocrisy and darkness of Russian society at that time, but he also asked everyone to believe in God in order to prevent thorough resistance at home and maintain the status of the feudal aristocracy, thus damaging the value of many of his great works. "Waves of Life" should be given the same evaluation for expressing the dark side of society while simultaneously promoting Christian dogma. Of course, I am not saying that the author of "Waves of Life" can be compared with Tolstoy; what I mean is the intention of Christians to expose the dark side of society.</p>
<p>As for the artistic expressiveness of this novel, it is also very low. For the development of events and the expressions of characters, the author only narrates abstractly, and cannot be said to portray them concretely. However, the main characteristic of literary works lies in concrete, vivid, and artistic expression. If you want to express that something is very serious, or that a situation is very tense, or that someone is very painful, these cannot be expressed by certain abstract words or certain simple lists of facts, but must delve into the core of the event and the hearts of the characters, and depict them concretely and vividly from all aspects. The events and characters depicted in a work must make people feel as if real events and living characters appear before their eyes, that is good, otherwise it is an inferior product; and "Waves of Life" belongs to the latter in terms of artistic expression. Just to give an example, such as Muyun being imprisoned at home, her grandfather wanting to bury her alive because she resisted marriage, and her mother being forced to death, how tense should this section be, and what should the various scenes in this section be like, but in the author's writing, in addition to Muyun's simple crying, many necessary scenes, such as the grandfather's tyrannical posture, the kind mother's inner contradictions, Muyun's painful and angry psychology and expressions, and the intricate relationships between family members and relatives in this incident, have not been concretized; therefore, in this section of facts, there is no climax or culmination of excitement, tension, grief, or anger, no living scenes, and no living characters: all that is there is flat confession and narration. – This is the author's lack of artistic expressiveness.</p>
<p>Because of the author's low artistic expressiveness, the structure of this work is not rigorous, and the handling and arrangement of many events are inappropriate. I think that many unimportant things in the middle should be omitted in order to concentrate on depicting those important scenes. However, the author lists all the trivial things; sometimes even deliberately trying to make the event tortuous, leading to many unnecessary things, so the result makes people feel that the novel is just a pile and list of facts, and this pile and list is very scattered, almost completely without artistic meaning. As for the portrayal of typical characters, it is even more impossible to talk about being vivid and profound. Muyun and Renbang, as well as all the characters in the entire novel, have no personality and do not seem to be living people; after reading this novel, we cannot develop a vivid impression of all the expressions of the characters in the middle, their attitudes in talking and doing things, their inner and outer selves, and the main characteristics of their personalities. I think that even the author probably cannot specifically tell us what the personalities of Muyun and Renbang are.</p>
<p>However, the author's personal thoughts, what kind of attitude she has toward life, and what she hopes for can be seen in this work (as already said, the protagonist Huang Muyun is the author herself; as for who plays the male role, we still don't know), although there is her own defense and excessive exaggeration in the middle.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Critique of Malthus' Theory of Population <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Xian</p>
<p>The population problem is a very complicated issue. However, among the scholars of the bourgeoisie, the scholar who is revered as the authority on the theory of population is Malthus. In Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, because of the rise of modern nation-states, the special development of commercial capitalism, and the enrichment and strengthening of the country, the acquisition of overseas colonies became the most common demands of various countries, so at that time, various countries competed to promote population growth as a policy, which was entirely in order to establish a strong army, to travel and immigrate, and even to increase the population in order to increase consumption and expand the domestic market. However, at the same time in the 18th century, industrial</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Capitalism also developed rapidly, so because of its concentration and destructive effects, a large layer of poor proletarians was gradually created in the lower classes of society, and even gradually manifested as a surplus of labor, and an industrial reserve army of unemployment was constantly discovered. As a result, the increase in population became a labor bulge phenomenon that capitalism could not digest, and even the poor relief laws and other measures that had been advocated in the past to compensate for the shortcomings of the population increase policy still became useless and harmful policies. Therefore, abandoning the policy of increasing the population could not but become a new attempt of capitalist production, and Malthus' theory of population arose from this attempt. His theory of the population problem was published at the beginning of the 19th century, and the core of his theory was to oppose the policy of increasing the population, and advocating birth control was a prominent proof.</p>
<p>According to the main points of Malthus' theory of population, first, he believes that according to the natural fertility rate of human beings, it increases geometrically, such as 1:2; 2:4; 4:8; 8:16; 16:32. However, the increase in food, even if human productivity is advancing, its rate of advance can only increase according to arithmetic progression, that is, according to an arithmetic progression such as 1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8. Therefore, comparing the rate of food increase with the rate of population increase, the former is always unable to catch up with the latter. Second, but why has mankind experienced so many years of history, and there is still no problem of overcrowding on the earth? In his view, this is because when the increase in food and population is slightly out of balance, there is a disharmony between production and consumption, between needs and supplies, so survival competition, the law of the jungle, and the survival of the fittest occur among human beings themselves, and famines, wars, killing the old and abandoning the young, etc. restrict their suppression, and too many people are eliminated, and even defensive restrictions are carried out due to poverty, etc., so that the population cannot increase according to its natural rate of increase. Third, because the population increases faster than food, and because all the poverty and evils of society arise from this, facilities such as poor relief laws and increased wages actually promote population growth and the occurrence of social evils, so to save society's morbid state, only the implementation of early marriage correction and birth control is a proper and possible way.</p>
<p>Malthus' theory of population not only shows that capitalist production replaces labor with its machine production, and creates social poverty and unemployment with its concentration and destruction of small production, and attempts to suppress the increase in population because it cannot digest the excess labor, as we have already mentioned above, but it also has a role in concealing the contradictions of this production system. Because the wars, poverty, and excessive labor of some people and the unemployment of others to the point of having nothing to do, and even the evils of malnutrition in capitalist society, are entirely caused by the contradictions of the system itself. However, Malthus attributed this cause to the balance between population increase and food increase, and as a result of this survival competition, this is entirely to make everyone unable to see the defects of capitalist production under the cover of this theory, and to shift the target to the natural law of human reproduction, where they want to find a way of salvation, how clever and cheap is this?</p>
<p>In Malthus' theory of the population problem, there are many fundamental errors that we must point out. The first is that his theory that the population increases according to geometric progression, while food increases according to arithmetic progression, and the increase in food cannot keep up with the increase in population, is not entirely correct. Naturally, if we talk about the purely natural law of population increase, it should indeed be very fast, but human beings are not simply subject to natural laws like ordinary organisms, so in terms of reproduction, they are also subject to social laws. The development of productive forces, social relations of production and their systems, etc., all specifically dominate the increase or decrease of population and human reproduction. For example, in primitive ethnic groups where production is young, the fact of killing the old and abandoning the young is common because they cannot support a large population. In patriarchal and feudal societies, under the production form of patriarchal system and agricultural economy, due to the prosperity of large families and the need for extensive labor in farming, and the lifelong gathering of the two sexes without separation, etc., there is a demand for many children and grandchildren, which affects the population growth. However, in the lower masses of capitalist society, because of poverty and the inability to marry, as well as the destruction of ten families and the necessity for the two sexes to make a living separately, etc., all of which are sufficient to affect the low decline of the population fertility rate. Therefore, unless there are natural disasters, wars, etc. that massively destroy the population in the past agricultural economic society, and modern capitalist countries encourage reproduction due to special relationships, such as Italy, the general fertility rate in the lower classes, the productivity of capitalist society is lower than that of the past agricultural economic society. Here I will only give a few examples from before and after the Great War to prove this. In 1908, the population productivity rate was 33.7 in Japan; 26.6 in the United States; 26.2 in Norway; 25.7 in Sweden; 28.6 in Denmark; 29.7 in the Netherlands; 24.9 in Belgium; 20.1 in France; 33.7 in Italy; 32.0 in Germany; but in 1918, Japan was 32.2; the United Kingdom was 17.5; Norway was 25.8; Sweden was 20.1; Denmark was 24.2; the Netherlands was 25.3; Belgium was 9.5; France was 10.0; Italy was 19.0 in 1917; and Germany was 26.5 in 1914. The simple numbers tell us that the further capitalist society develops, the lower the population fertility rate becomes. There is not a single country in Europe or even Japan whose population fertility rate in 1918 was not lower than in 1908. Although the European war passed in the middle, this has little to do with the war's death toll, because this is in terms of the productivity rate of every thousand living people. From this, we can see that the productivity rate of population increase cannot be explained according to the natural law of biology, it is dominated by social laws, and it expresses its progress and retreat according to the changing laws of productive forces and relations of production. Of course, Malthus also said that the increase in population is restricted by the economic and productive restrictions of food, but he always regards the natural law of population reproduction as the theme. In fact, it is only an abstract concept, not the concrete law of population change. Only by explaining population change based on the changes in productive forces and relations of production can it be a concrete and truly applicable law. Malthus' law is a useless abstract law, not the real law of human reproduction.</p>
<p>As for whether the increase in food can keep up with the increase in population? Here Malthus is still trapped in the mud pit of abstract comparison errors. First, the increase in food itself is not always limited to an unchanging arithmetic progression. In the more forward advance of productive forces, its rate of increase is greater, and it may even jump from arithmetic progression to geometric progression. If you take a look at the progress of modern agricultural and industrial production, you will know that using the same labor and the same land as before to produce can now obtain many times higher products. Second, even taking the comparison between population increase and food increase, the productive efficiency of a person's labor now exceeds the amount he can consume by many times because he has the help of science and technology. That is to say, his productivity is several times higher than his fertility rate, because in terms of the number of people that his productivity can support, it is absolutely impossible for his fertility to catch up. Now a worker's product can support dozens or hundreds of people, but is his fertility that great? In fact, it is lower. If his production is used to support all his children, it cannot be consumed, not to mention that his children will continue to produce. It is a pity that in the current society, his surplus production has turned against the capitalist to increase capital and support many parasites, so he and the general hard-working people are still in poverty, but this is by no means because their production volume is not enough to support them.</p>
<p>Secondly, because of that fundamental premise error, Malthus attributed the useless consumption of the population to the survival competition caused by insufficient food, wars, poorness, poor treatment, etc., and attributed all the evils of society to insufficient food, and regarded the loss of population as the natural law of the survival of the fittest. To be honest, his theory is entirely just to cover up the evils of the social system. Because the root cause of all wars and poverty, everyone can now understand that it is the contradiction in the capitalist relations of production, not due to insufficient food, nor is it dominated by any natural law of human survival competition. If you say that this is the inevitable result of insufficient food, then why do the current milk and coffee kings pour these things into the sea, and store wheat in warehouses to listen? If you say this is survival competition, then is it that without this war and the exploitation and oppression of capital, human beings cannot survive? And are the current hard-working masses naturally inferior, so they should naturally be punished by poverty, unable to marry and have children, malnutrition, overwork, etc., in order to consume their lives and the right to transmit their species and be eliminated? In fact, the civilization of modern society is created by the hard-working masses, and in terms of their achievements, they are precisely the best for survival, and should not be the inferior who are eliminated by survival competition. Therefore, it is completely incorrect to attribute all social evils to the survival competition caused by insufficient food, and to regard the loss of population among the hard-working masses as the inferior who are eliminated in survival competition. These evils should be borne by the social system itself, and are the result of the existing relations of production.</p>
<p>Since social poverty, wars, and all evils are not due to the rapid increase in population and the slow increase in food, but to the result of social relations of production, then the fundamental solution to this problem is not what Malthus proposed to restrict early marriage and childbirth, etc., that can be effective (although early marriage should be restricted), but to transform the social relations themselves. Many birth control advocates today are probably based on Malthus's theory and the method of solving poverty, which we dare not agree with in the slightest.</p>
<p>Biography of a Famous Person</p>
<h3 id="e199">Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Nan</p>
<p>Anyone who pays attention to the international situation almost certainly knows the famous name of the Red diplomat Litvinov. He is the main executor of the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomacy in recent years; even if we don't acknowledge the success of Soviet peaceful diplomacy in recent years, Litvinov can be said to be the practical figure representing this success.</p>
<p>Litvinov's appearance is quite similar to that of a wealthy merchant. His face is round and plump, his belly protrudes, and his gait is naturally not very agile. He really resembles a corpulent businessman. Indeed, strangely enough, this Red diplomat did not come from an impoverished family. His father could be considered a wealthy man of his time, and he himself aspired to become a great entrepreneur during his youth. However, he was later influenced by the intellectual currents of the time and dedicated himself to the revolution. As a result, in 1910, he was arrested by the Tsarist government and exiled to the desolate Siberia, where he first tasted the bitterness of revolution and at the same time strengthened his conviction.</p>
<p>In the Russian revolutionary movement, one of Litvinov's main contributions can be attributed to his assistance in economic affairs. He had worked as a bookseller, as a draftsman for an architect, and as a traveling salesman. His talent at that time could be said to be the same as his talent in diplomacy now. He was able to use many methods to achieve victory and the goal of making money. However, he did not put the money he earned into his own pocket, but used it to support the revolution. What is generally known now is that Gorky provided economic assistance to the Russian revolution at that time, but few people know that Litvinov also made a significant economic contribution to the past Russian revolution. If one were to "assess merits and award prizes" now, then the diplomat Litvinov and the writer Gorky should be mentioned in the same breath.</p>
<p>In 1918, after the success of the Russian Revolution, Litvinov was in London, and Moscow telegraphed to appoint him as the ambassador to England. When this news spread, the British, knowing that a former traveling peddler had become an ambassador, were understandably astonished. But this was only the beginning of Litvinov's activities in the diplomatic world, and his remarkable performance was yet to come.</p>
<p>Litvinov's appearance on the international diplomatic stage, playing an important role, was at the Fourth World Disarmament Conference in November 1929. The fact is that while the great powers were arguing endlessly in the conference, Litvinov, on behalf of the Soviet Union, dropped a surprising bombshell. He proposed to immediately implement complete disarmament, completely abolishing the army, navy, and air force. Although this astonishing proposal was rejected, the name of the new diplomat Litvinov was deeply noted by the great powers. By 1930, he officially became the Soviet Foreign Minister, frequently traveling between important cities such as London, Paris, and Geneva, working hard on the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomatic activities.</p>
<p>After becoming the official Foreign Minister, in 1931 and 1932, Litvinov, based on the Soviet Union's peace policy, signed treaties of non-aggression with neighboring countries such as Poland, Finland, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, building a secure defense line around the Soviet Union. Then, at the London World Economic Conference in 1933, he further demonstrated his diplomatic skills, seeing through the internal panic and mutual contradictions of the great powers, often defeating Germany's attacks, and signing multilateral agreements with Turkey and Afghanistan, gaining Spain's recognition of the Soviet Union, as well as the pro-Russian sentiments of countries such as Britain, the United States, and France.</p>
<p>People say that 1933 to 1934 was Litvinov's diplomatic year, and this is indeed not an exaggeration. During this period, this new diplomat was busy on diplomatic journeys almost every day, leaving many important records in the history of Soviet diplomacy. Among them, what is particularly worth mentioning are the . The former, from the current perspective, although has no decisive effect on the international situation, is somewhat related to the development and changes of the Far East situation. As for the latter, it can be said to be a key to the transformation of the recent European and even world situation. We know that before Hitler came to power, the Soviet Union was close to Germany in resisting France, while France at that time was the organizer of the anti-Soviet front; conversely, since Hitler came to power, not only did German-Russian relations deteriorate, but the contradictions between Germany and France also became more acute, which promoted the rapprochement between France and the Soviet Union; and Litvinov was one of the intermediaries for the rapprochement between France and the Soviet Union. Due to the development of the friendly relations between France and the Soviet Union, great changes have taken place in the European and even the world situation. We only need to look at the recent debates within France regarding the Franco-Soviet pact, and Hitler's tearing up the Locarno Treaty and marching troops into the Rhineland on the pretext that France would ratify this pact, to imagine the relationship between Franco-Soviet intimacy and the European and world situation.</p>
<p>When the Soviet Union was invited to join the League of Nations, Litvinov declared that he was a representative of a new country in the world, and at the same time, he explicitly stated the Soviet Union's pacifism. This is because the Soviet Union exists in the real capitalist society and must still have necessary relations with various capitalist countries, and cannot completely detach itself from the national relations of this world. Based on this principle, the Soviet Union has been working hard on internal construction and at the same time using the contradictions between capitalist countries to ensure its own security: and Litvinov is the executor of this security-guaranteeing peaceful diplomacy. Now, as the international situation becomes increasingly tense, his diplomatic work is naturally becoming more tense. He is now an old man over sixty years old, but he still maintains the active spirit of youth in his diplomatic work, and he is fighting for the security of the Soviet Union and the real peace of the world.</p>

<h3 id="e200">How to Study International Politics? <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Lisheng</p>
<p>Since you live in the real world, you cannot but pay attention to the political situation of this world. Because whether you like it or not, changes in international politics are bound to affect your country, and thus inevitably affect your life. For example, the currency war triggered by the political struggle between Britain, Japan, and the United States for markets in the Pacific directly affected China's monetary policy, and thus affected the lives of all Chinese people. Also, the dynamics of European politics, which are farther away from us, are also closely related to us; in fact, political events such as the pro-Japanese and pro-German development resulting from the conflict between Germany, France, and Russia are directly related to the liberation of the Chinese people. As for the outbreak of a world war and changes in the Far East situation, they will even more strongly affect the lives of everyone. Therefore, if you do not want to live muddleheadedly, and you are living during this period when the world crisis is developing, you should earnestly pay attention to changes in the domestic and international political situation in order to determine your attitude towards life; the motto of "not talking about current affairs" will not be accepted by a living person, except for a muddleheaded fool who is content with ignorance.</p>
<p>So, how do you study international politics? Now we are going to talk to you about this issue.</p>
<p>First of all, you should know that the economy is the foundation of society, and certain political forms or political changes arise from a certain economic foundation; we can say that the development and changes of international politics follow the development and changes of the international economy. In broad terms, the war crisis currently manifested by international political relations is guided by the crisis of world economic development. Because in the development of the world economy, all capitalist countries have experienced contradictions of overproduction and inability to sell, and under these contradictions, they have to desperately compete for markets, so the problem of redivision of colonies and wars for markets has become increasingly realistic. In terms of partial international political dynamics, such as Italy's invasion of Abyssinia, it is clearly also caused by the development of the internal economic crisis in Italy; we must understand the phenomena of Italy's lack of raw materials, overpopulation, national impoverishment, unemployment panic, trade shrinkage, and financial crisis in order to understand Mussolini's adventurous act of invading East Africa. Furthermore, when it comes to the foreign policy of each country, it is even more necessary to explain it in terms of its economic situation? Here we can cite a clear example. The outward aggression of Italy, Germany, and their fellow travelers in the East often takes military force as the vanguard, using military and political aggression to assist and develop economic aggression, but the United States is conducting economic aggression "peacefully" without first taking military risks. What is the reason for this? Are they not all imperialists? Why are their methods of aggression different? This is because The United States’ situation means that it cannot engage in "peaceful" competition with other imperialists, so it has to take military risks; while the United States, because its financial power is too great, can control North America and can invade the colonies or exclusive markets of other imperialists without first engaging in military competition. Based on these, we should be able to think that if we do not understand the situation of the world economy and the general situation of the economies of various countries, we cannot understand the complicated international political relations and the political dynamics of various countries.</p>
<p>Secondly, you should pay attention to the history and content of international treaties, especially those important international treaties that have been produced since the last world war; such as the Treaty of Versailles, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Locarno Treaty, etc. Because although treaties cannot absolutely bind the actions of the great powers, generally speaking, there is a close relationship between them and the internal and external affairs of the treaty countries; moreover, we can even say that the formal structure of international relations is based on international treaties as a clue. Therefore, every new event that occurs in the international community will arouse public opinion in various countries to evaluate and discuss certain treaties. Don't we often see news in the newspaper that a certain country accuses a certain country of violating the spirit of a certain treaty? That can be said to be the concrete struggle of the provisions of international politics. More specifically, such as Germany's rearmament in the past, the French recognized as a violation of the Versailles Treaty; recently, Germany's abolition of the Locarno Treaty and the deployment of troops into the Rhineland has aroused a struggle of international faith, which is not only a superficial treaty issue, but also a manifestation of the sharp intensification of the political interests of Germany and France at the root. Because the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno Treaty are tools used by France to ensure its victories in the last world war and to control Europe, it must maintain these two treaties; conversely, in Germany's view, these two treaties are binding on Germany's development, so it is always trying to lift them. In this way, in the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno Treaty, Germany and France have an irreconcilable political conflict. From this point of view, if we study international politics without knowing the history and content of important international treaties, then not only will we be unable to sort out a clue to the complicated international relations, but even the words of what treaty is printed on the newspaper every day may not be understood, and in practice become a blind person who cannot even understand the newspaper.</p>
<p>Moreover, from a horizontal perspective, the world's geographical situation is also something that students of international politics should pay attention to. Because the national defense of various countries in the world and the ways in which they develop outward are directly related to their geographical situation, certain important places often become the goals of great power struggles and become the center of international political problems. Such as the Mediterranean problem, the Danube River basin problem, the Balkan problem, the Memel problem, the Pacific problem, etc., are currently the. the problem , and we don’t understand the world's shape , don’t know the location of various important places in the world and their political, economic, or military functions, then we cannot understand the dynamics of international politics. Let's take a recent example. For example, the problem of Italy's use of violence to occupy Abyssinia, although this is caused by the internal reasons why Italy must invade outward, but here the question is why Italy did not march into the Balkans or other places, but must embark on an expedition to East Africa? The reason is that the situation in the Balkans or other places is too complicated, and Britain, France, and other countries have strong forces there, making Mussolini afraid to act rashly in those places; as for Abyssinia, although it also has a deep stake in countries such as Britain and France, their direct power there is not very great; and Abyssinia is connected to Italian Eritrea and Somaliland, and swallowing Abyssinia can make Italy's colonies in Africa into one piece; therefore, Mussolini chose this weak country—Abyssinia—that would not encounter extremely strong resistance as the object of his outward aggression. Although our explanation cannot be used to fully explain the relationship between Italy's invasion of Abyssinia and the geographical situation, it can be clearly seen in the middle that this problem does have a great relationship in the geographical situation. Therefore, if you do not understand Italy's position in Europe and in the world, and do not know the terrain of Abyssinia, then you cannot understand the entirety of the problem.</p>
<p>In addition, five-sixths of the countries on the Earth today have many classes, and even many groups in these classes. They each have political parties and political spokespersons, who often stand on their positions to express or even implement certain political views; therefore, a change in a country's cabinet, the turnover of administrative personnel, will affect it's internal and external affairs that are moving: This is not only directly related to the internal politics of its own country, but also has a greater or lesser impact on the world situation. For example, in Germany before Hitler came to power, German-Soviet relations were very good, while Franco-Soviet relations were deteriorating, but after Hitler came to power, because the groups he represented and the policies he pursued were different, German-Soviet relations deteriorated, and the contradictions between Germany and France became more acute, which also promoted the rapprochement between France and the Soviet Union, changing the European situation. Another example is the result of the recent French general election, where the left-wing People's Front won a great victory, and the Socialist Party rose to form a cabinet, which is bound to have a great impact on the European situation. Therefore, when we study international politics, we must know what groups the political parties and politicians of the major countries in the world represent and what their political views are; otherwise, we will not only be unable to understand certain changes that occur in international politics, see the trends in the international situation, but also be at a loss for the political changes in the major countries.</p>
<p>In addition, studying international politics naturally requires actual "study," and requires regular reading of books and newspapers; moreover, when studying, it must be particularly attentive and not sloppy. For example, some people just glance at the international news in the newspaper and only look at the title; but they do not know that the entire content of political news cannot be displayed in a few words of the title, and sometimes the truth of certain news cannot even be seen in the surface words that record it. It is necessary to carefully study and understand its "meaning beyond the words" to understand its essence. If necessary, you can even subscribe to several newspapers and magazines to read; I think that in the current China, such as "Shen Bao," "Shen Bao Weekly," "Ta Kung Pao," "Shishi Xinbao," "Damei Evening News," "World Knowledge," etc., those who study international politics need to subscribe to them regularly.</p>

<h3 id="e201">How to Hire a Maid <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Lunyan</p>
<p>Hiring a maid is not an easy task. The "辍耕录" says it well: "When a maid first comes, she is called a 'beaded abacus,' meaning she moves without being pushed. After a while, she is called a 'counting abacus,' meaning she moves when pushed. After a long time, she is called a 'Buddha's head bead,' meaning she is always still, and does not move even when pushed." This is a good description of a maid. Then how can a maid always be like a "beaded abacus," moving without being pushed? Let me tell you.</p>
<p>Before going to a matchmaker to call for a nanny, first, you must decide what kind of person you like to use. For example, if you like Suzhou nannies, then go to the "Suzhou Matchmaker Shop." If you like strong Anhui nannies, then go to the "Jinling Matchmaker Shop." Otherwise, you will never find a satisfactory nanny. Second, you must understand the situation of your own family and what age of maid is appropriate. For example, if your family lives in a three-story building, and there are children studying at school who need to have lunch delivered, or there are many letters coming and going, and you often have to go to the post office to send letters, then you must use a strong maid who is between twenty-two or three years old and thirty-five years old, otherwise she will not be able to do the job happily.</p>
<p>After deciding on your own ideas, you can go to the matchmaker shop to choose. At this time, you can carefully observe which one has the neatest clothes—not gorgeous—the most dignified attitude, the most peaceful demeanor, and the strongest body. That one should be selected. Because those who cannot even clean their own clothes will not do things cleanly, those with a frivolous attitude and reckless behavior are prone to cause trouble, and those with a weak body cannot do anything at all. In order to avoid future disputes, you must be stricter at the beginning.</p>
<p>After the maid is selected, she must first do a trial run for three days. During these three days, the maid is at her most hardworking, that is, the so-called "beaded abacus." However, because "newcomers are slow and do not know the pots and pans," the housewife must tell her in detail what she should do every day. But you must be adaptable. For example, if the maid comes at nine in the morning, which is the time to pick and wash vegetables and prepare lunch, you must tell her how to distribute the vegetables and how many liters of rice to measure. If she comes at two or three in the afternoon—which is rare, most come in the morning—, then tell her to wash clothes and cook dinner. Before going to bed, tell her what time to get up tomorrow, and after getting up, first start the coal stove and cook porridge, and then clean up the living room, so that she will not be at a loss after getting up.</p>
<p>After three days of work, if both the master and the servant are satisfied, then it is time to "set the wages." After the wages are set, it must be done for at least one month. Neither party can "terminate the contract," otherwise, they will have to compensate for the loss—if the master takes the initiative, the master will pay an extra month's wages, and if the servant takes the initiative, one month's wages will be deducted.</p>
<p>During the first month, the housewife should be particularly careful in handling the household affairs and pay attention to all the actions of the maid. Because the first month is the best period for the housewife to test the maid. If the housewife handles the household affairs in an orderly manner, then the maid will know that the housewife is very shrewd and will not dare to cheat. "People's hearts are different, each is like their face." How can you know whether this maid is honest or cunning in the short three-day trial period? Therefore, the housewife should test her at any time and anywhere—but be careful not to let the maid know that you want to test her. For example, if you want to know whether the maid is going to steal or be greedy for small profits, you can pretend to forget to leave copper coins on the table, and secretly remember how many copper coins there are. A day or half a day later, go to the table alone to see if the copper coins are still there, or if a few are missing. If it is intact, this maid is honest. If it is gone or a few are missing, you can know that this maid is dishonest.</p>
<p>After working for a month, if this maid is indeed loyal, thrifty, and can continue to work, then you can relax your precautions, and you do not have to pay attention and strictly supervise her all the time. Within the possible range, you can also entrust part of the work to her completely, such as buying vegetables, cooking, and preparing meals, and let her do everything. She will definitely do it in an orderly manner, and there will be no profiteering or reporting less. Because people have a sense of self-esteem. If they gain the trust of others, their self-esteem is satisfied, and they will definitely work wholeheartedly, especially those with simple minds. Aren't there many old servants who are respectful to their masters, loyal to their duties, and willing to sacrifice themselves to serve their masters?</p>
<p>The housewife's attitude towards the maid should be kind and dignified, so that she feels that you are both approachable and awe-inspiring. Do not speak too commandingly, but mix some ordinary conversation into the commanding style, because speaking in a commanding style will cause unpleasant feelings in the listener, and doing things will be reluctant.</p>
<p>It is inevitable for a person to make mistakes. When a maid does something wrong, what should we do? I think it is best not to scold her, or even beat her. We must first ask the reason for the mistake. If it is unintentional, then there is no need to scold her, just carefully tell her to be careful in the future.</p>
<p>Do not be too harsh on maids. Do not put on the airs of a master, and do not divide the boundaries between master and servant too strictly, treating her as a slave. Rice should be given to her according to her appetite, and the side dishes should not be too meager. Do not arbitrarily shout and send her around. She should be given time to rest every day, after she has finished what she should do. She should be given adequate sleep every day, and unless there are special circumstances, do not make her sleep too late. She should have a small portion of time each day to do her own private affairs—such as tailoring clothes for herself, her children, and her husband, making shoes for her children, or going out to visit relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Do not change servants often, because changing new people often is not only a waste of money—matchmaking fees—but also causes great losses in spirit. When a new maid comes in, how much energy and effort do you have to spend to train her and test her. If she is changed after one or two months, isn't this energy and effort wasted?</p>
<p>There is one point that the housewife must pay the most attention to, that is, do not let the maid know your weaknesses, because cunning</p>
<p>Continued on page 5</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>maids will use your weaknesses to satisfy her desires. For example, a housewife who likes to play mahjong, and spends nine and a half days out of ten playing mahjong, the maid will use this weakness to pull "partners" for the mistress every day. In this way, she not only pleases the master, but also has a lot of "extra money"—tips—coming in every day, and can also take the opportunity to joke and slack off arbitrarily when the mistress has no time to take care of the household affairs. A weak, indecisive housewife, if the maid knows her weakness, the maid will take independent action and overstep her authority.</p>
<p>There is also a point, that is, the housewife should not collude with the maid to cheat, and regard the maid as a "confidante." This is most likely to develop the maid's habit of being domineering. For example, a housewife who likes to gamble, but is afraid of being questioned by her husband, she is afraid that the maid will tell her husband, so she uses money to bribe the maid, telling her not to tell the master, and even borrows money from the maid when she lacks gambling money, or asks the maid to pawn items. The first time it is a command style, the second time it is a discussion style, and the third time it becomes a pleading style. In this way, the maid's arrogance is greatly increased. She not only despises the housewife, but also gradually teaches and coerces the housewife. And the housewife, at this time, not only dares not offend her, but also has to contact her, win her favor, and rely on her. So this maid becomes your strategist, advisor, and also your chronic disease.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Nature and Characters in Literature <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Xirong</p>
<p>How can artistic creations be described to be moving? This requires effort in technique. Describing scenery is one of the crucial factors in literary works. To depict nature, one must have a faithful attitude to observe it. The author needs to cultivate a habit of loving nature, and as the master of nature, must never be a servant commanded by it.</p>
<p>The depiction of nature can be divided into three aspects: outlining, describing mood, and describing color:</p>
<p>Literature is also close to painting. Only when people feel as if they are in a painting after reading it can the ability of literature be fully utilized. In the Romantic era, literary techniques often focused on mesoscopic descriptions. Therefore, the works at that time mostly drew materials from the description of trivial matters around the author and often adopted a first-person perspective. However, the huge waves of literary trends have surged to the other shore of new realism. The author's subjective position should not be revealed in the work. It is necessary to penetrate the inner layer of life with an objective attitude, discover its beauty and ugliness, and present it nakedly to the reader, which is progress. Therefore, the natural description in literary works should also be described objectively and meticulously, just like painting. This is called "realism," which is an advancement in landscape painting techniques.</p>
<p>How to record and arrange natural scenery? This is what we must discuss first:</p>
<p>1.  Central Point Although the scenery of nature is very complex, a central point can be selected, focusing on the depiction of this central point, while treating other parts as a foil. There is an old saying called "setting off the moon with clouds." The central point should be the moon, and the writing of the clouds is only for the mission of setting off the moon. For example, in Zhu Ziqing's "Lotus Pond Moonlight," he mentioned tall shrubs, faint shadows of willows, vague distant mountains, and scattered streetlights, but what we feel after reading it is only "the freshness of the moonlight." Why is this? Because the central point of description in that article is the "moon."</p>
<p>2.  Background Arrangement In addition to the central point, there must be foreground and background, just like painting. It would be too monotonous to paint a lonely village house. Adding a few green willows next to the house is the foreground arrangement. Adding vague distant mountains behind the house is the background arrangement. A picture of a village house constructed in this way will feel perfect and harmonious. However, the color of this background arrangement should not be too rich. Generally, the central point is the richest, the foreground is second, and the background is the last.</p>
<p>For a deep description of scenery, in addition to the outline, one must also rely on a deep, keen perception. Perception is emotional, so the description of "mood" is also necessary. The same bright moon hangs in the sky. To a happy person, the "round, bright moon" further increases infinite joy, but to a melancholic person, the "desolate moonlight" will make one unbearable sad. Why does the same moon evoke such a wide range of emotions? This is because the evoked moods are different. Lu Yin's description of the beauty of Penglai mentions "a detached, otherworldly feeling" and "another kind of secluded interest," which are examples of describing mood.</p>
<p>Also, the color of nature is often related to time. The light has brightness, darkness, intensity, and weakness, and the colors expressed by nature are also different. A clear sky presents a blue color, giving people a sense of relaxation and pleasure; a cloudy sky presents a gray color, giving people a sense of dullness and depression. Those who are good at writing about nature focus on paying attention to these ever-changing colors, so that the entire text reveals different emotions such as excitement, peace, shock, lightness, and purity in the colors.</p>
<p>Next, we want to talk about the creation of characters in literature. Mr. Yu Dafu said: The events in novels are all performed by people, and characters are naturally the most important elements in novels. Based on this understanding, we must devote our greatest efforts to the creation of characters. Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q" not only laid the foundation for the trend of the Chinese literary world, but also the Ah Q he created has become a typical representation of Chinese farmers. This is a good example.</p>
<p>Although people's personalities, habits, behaviors, and thoughts are different, no matter how great a character is, they cannot escape the restrictions of time and space. The influence of time is the "era," and the influence of space is the "social environment" and "natural environment."</p>
<p>First, the environment of time—for example, Confucius was born in the late Zhou Dynasty Spring and Autumn period. The era at that time was one of respecting kings and valuing ritual education. Even with Confucius's wisdom, he could not jump out of that circle. Therefore, criticizing his thoughts with the modern eyes of the twentieth century is naturally a mismatch. Marx was born at a time when the industrial revolution, the factory system, and the rise of capitalism were taking place, which made it possible for the brewing of socialism and the theory of surplus value. Rather than being amazed at Marx's innate greatness, it is better to say that Marx was actually dominated by the spirit of the times.</p>
<p>Second, the limitation of space—the limitation of space can be divided into the limitation of the social environment and the limitation of the natural environment. No one can escape the influence of the artificial environment such as social customs, political systems, and economic background at that time; Mozi was born in a society during the Warring States period where mutual killings were extremely severe, and politicians were engaged in diplomacy and war all day long, so he had the theory of universal love of "regarding the country of others as one's own country, regarding the family of others as one's own family, and regarding the body of others as one's own body." Similarly, no one can escape the influence of the natural environment: northerners are mostly bold and unrestrained, southerners are mostly gentle and weak, people in mountain valleys are mostly stubborn and narrow-minded, people living by the sea are mostly leisurely and romantic, people living in rural villages are mostly honest and simple, and people living in cities are mostly frivolous and flighty. These are all restricted by the natural environment.</p>
<p>When creating characters and expressing their thoughts, behaviors, and emotions, the above-mentioned time, society, and nature should be used as the background, and their personality and psychology should be depicted.</p>
<p>Personal characteristics are the unique qualities of a certain person, and they are individual. If a similar type cannot be found among others besides this person, it is considered personality. Flaubert said: There are no two identical stones or two identical leaves in the world. Everything has its own personality. If you cannot find its personality, you cannot describe the thing. Therefore, the description of characters also needs to express personality. The reason why "Dream of the Red Chamber" has become the swan song of Chinese chapter novels is because Mr. Cao Xueqin was able to grasp the personality characteristics of each character in the Grand View Garden and do his best to depict them. It is said that the author of "Water Margin" once drew pictures of the portraits of the 108 heroes in advance, and gazed at them day and night to ponder them, so the 108 characters he portrayed became distinct personalities.</p>
<p>Yu Dafu's "On Novels" has a passage about characters: "The characters in works are mostly typical characters, so they are more interesting than the characters in actual society, and most of them have the characteristics of a class or a society. For example, Don Quixote is a representative of dreamers, Hamlet is a representative of skeptics, and Tartufe (a character in Molière's comedy) is a representative of hypocrites. The reason why the characters of writers can make most readers feel interested in the characters of the author is precisely because they have this kind of Typical traits of Characteristics. However, when this kind of representative characteristic is abstracted too much, it is easy to lose the individuality of the characters and become characters in fables, such as Christam Hypocrite in Bunyan's "The Pilgrim's Progress," or become a Caricature, making readers unable to feel the overflowing sense of reality. This level is the most difficult point for novelists to create characters, and it is also the biggest turning point for success or failure." These theories are really the motto of novelists.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Diary from the Back Building (1) <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Shuyu</p>
<p>September 8, 1930</p>
<p>I am a poor salaried worker, and cannot afford a day of idleness; but now I have been unemployed for nearly two months, and this unemployment, like the previous one, is gradually destroying the spirit and resources that I had painstakingly restored!</p>
<p>Writing a diary seems to be a special enjoyment only for the leisure class. When I have a job, I am always busy all day long and have no time to hold a pen; taking advantage of the current loneliness and boredom, sorrow and depression, I can just be close to this little booklet and pour out every drop of my pain to it, accumulating it inside, making it my own shadow, to share the heavy burden of all my misfortunes.</p>
<p>In the modern deformed society where time is money, even if we put aside the saying that "an inch of time is worth an inch of gold," it is not profitable for a person to be too idle. Recently, I have been so idle that I feel bored - but this is obviously forced and violates my psychology. In fact, I am not idle at all - I am lonely and depressed all day long. Therefore, when I started writing this diary, I felt that there was nothing to write about.</p>
<p>Life is really too empty! Besides the two major events of eating and sleeping, there is nothing else to fill its content, and I have no intention of reading. As my spirit becomes increasingly depressed and my mind gradually declines and becomes lazy, I have hardly been aware of space and time in the past two months. I confine myself to a small, cage-like room all day long, and I don't want to run anywhere, can't run, or even dare to peek out from the window at the prosperous city built of gold and white jade. I don't remember the days and hours much, and I have never touched things like calendars. Really, playing with things like signing in at the office - no! Now that I think about it, that was a pleasure - I haven't been doing it for a long time. I no longer pay attention to which day is Sunday to rest, or which days are not Sunday and should be working; I pay no attention to the passage of time, the passing of years, or the change of seasons. If it weren't for the landlady asking me yesterday, "So, when are you moving in? Is tomorrow okay? Tomorrow is the 8th," I really wouldn't know what day it is today! It seemed like I had heard someone mention "September," but "8th" was a bit vague.</p>
<p>The landlady's slightly rectangular and flat face is really the most suitable, a living calendar that cannot be bought with money. She reported the date to me very accurately. I promised her that I would move to her place on the 14th.</p>
<p>Remembering the days and cherishing time is really a very stupid thing for me. Recently, I have definitely felt more tired of this difficult life than before. I only hope that time will pass quickly, to shorten my useless life that is only busy for living every day. I am suffering from "life sickness," and "death" is a specific medicine! This is a new invention of mine in modern medicine.</p>
