<p>時評</p>
<h3>抗議平津日軍大演戰</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>當京滬各地正以蔣院長壽辰熱烈舉行慶祝之際在同屬於我國主權的華北則因日軍舉行大規模的演操民房被佔居戶被逐恐慌情形達於極點這兩種情形的差別是我們當前所不能忽視的據三十日中央社南京電政府因日軍此舉違反條約與國際公法破壞我國主權已由外部致文日使館提出抗議這是理所當然的茲就外交及政治方面論析此次日軍在華北演戰的違法背理以促起全國上下的注意</p>
<p>年來隣邦侵害我國主權已屬數見不鮮在軍事行動方面尤其表現得厲害華北領空權的被破壞淞滬市區的被侵入沿海要塞港口的被窺探雖屢經我國政府抗議都未見效果而自從今年夏初日本大舉增兵華北以來接連的築兵營闢機塲甚至在鬧市演戰辛丑條約的限制已全被破壞我國人民之安全竟毫無保障但此次平津日軍的演操則爲從來規模最大的一决據中央社所傳全部參加兵員在七千人以上地域廣及平津通豐一帶自上月二十六日開始至今日尙未停息如此破壞我國主權擾害我國人民我國實應以最堅决之步驟加以制止</p>
<p>試就日本的本身地位加以考察美國在東太平洋舉行演操其範圍僅伸及密都威島一帶日方就以爲受到威脅保持最嚴重的注意蘇聯爲預防外敵侵略集中大軍三十萬於遠東邊境日方也以爲受到威脅要求其撤回其實美蘇這些軍隊不過在它們本土的範圍內演習布防而日方已認爲含有威脅性質那麽七千大軍在我國領土內大舉演戰甚至以北平爲攻舉的對象究有何種依據這無疑的是破壞了我國的領土主權也威脅到我們國防與人民的安全</p>
<p>而且中日外交談判已到第六次據說尙無具體效果仍是一團僵局我們不知道這種威脅性質的演操究竟是要使僵局益趨僵化還是要以這種具體的威脅强把僵局打開而達到外交上進取的目的</p>
<p>總之從這决日軍的大演操我們可以想像到華北的危機現在是益加擴大而且深入了這事情實在是値得非常重視的</p>
<h3>基隆事件　英日齟齬益深刻　英對天羽宣言不滿　認爲含有挑撥性質</h3>
<p>（東京）英國駐日大使館對於日外務省發言人天羽昨所發表之「非必要的含有挑撥性質」宣言、表示非常詫異、按該項宣言係根據基隆意外事件、但天羽發言時、早知日本高級當局已下令繼續調查此事、而仍如此措辭、故認爲更含有「挑撥」之意、此事伴實際上已在審判之中、英方對於該發言人所稱、「英潛艇離基隆後、曾發見英海軍旗幟一面、飄流於港內之水面、於此卽可推知英艦在此停泊時、其艦中形狀之若何矣」云、極表反對、至於該發言人聲稱英國駐華體隊司令李德爾中將之展期訪日、乃完全英國本身之事一節、英方對之、亦表示異議云、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間人士認爲英艦「米德威」號水兵三人在台灣基隆地方所受日本警察之待遇、實屬「非常凶暴」、對於日方所傳英水兵未付車資之說、已經鄭重否認、英國駐亞海軍總司令李德爾中將已經詳加調查、並可充分證明該水兵等確將車資照付、並有軍官一名在傍目覩、又據調查所得、當該水兵三人被日方帶至警局時、皆亳無醉態、不料釋出後、三人皆遭毆打、遍體鱗傷、其一之頷部更被擊碎、英國當局以爲各水兵如確有擾亂秩序及酗酒等情事、日警出而干預、乃屬其應有之職務自不足爲怪、惟英海軍方面以水兵紀律素嚴、允以訪問他國領海時更不致有騷擾等行爲發生、目下對於此案、英方所擬抗議者、卽三水兵之被日警非常虐待是也、去年七月間、英方因有印度商人一名、在長春被扣留時、備受苛遇、曾向東京抗議、隨後終以無犯罪嫌疑釋放出外、至於滿境英國商行內中國僱員之受日警暴過者、更不可勝計、其中曾有因傷重而致死者一人、此次英國因基隆事件向日本提出抗議、目的在要求日方對於受傷水兵、給予相當之賠償、英政府深望日本能照此辦理、以便了結此不幸事件云、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）據同盟社台灣消息、該地當局對於英水兵三名在基隆受日警虐待一案、已詳細調查、英方所傳之種種事實、皆亳無根據云、此項調查、係在英國駐台灣領事提出抗議後、始由警署下令實行、據同盟消息、日方調查所得、係英水兵三人在十月七日深夜由某處僱乘汽車前往甚隆、不料三人下車後、卽步入咖啡館、而不將車資照付、於是汽車夫卽報吿附近崗警、日警當命英水兵赴警署、以便查問、其時有英海軍軍官一人、願出作證人、因該軍官之蹬辭與三水兵所供之事實、完全不相符合、遂亦將該軍官帶至警署、惟以上四人、均於决晨釋出、調查所得結果、該水兵等實未受任何虐待、英方此次忽對此事件提出抗議、可見英方或係別有用意、特借此案爲其藉口而已、（三十一日路透電）</p>

<h3>伊拉克政變後　成立軍人獨裁政府　錫德基爲主動人物　前首相出亡陸長槍斃</h3>
<p>耶路撒冷　伊拉克首都報達昨日發生未流血之政變後、該國實際上已成立軍事獨裁政府、在幕後活動之人物、卽爲錫德基將軍、伊拉克野心最大勢力雄厚之軍入也、惟新內閣名單中並無其人在內、消息靈通方面以爲伊拉克此次政變之促成、乃由於雙方對遊牧部落實施徵兵制一點發生齟齬所致、錫德基欲剿平猶佛拉蒂斯河流域希亞各族之叛亂、曾要求調遣軍隊、並準備有作戰能力之援兵、以備應用、故主張施行徵兵制、惟雅辛將軍所領導之政府、擬採取較溫和之態度、對於錫氏主張不允照辦、於是政變遂繼之發生、一般人皆預料薩萊門所組織之新內閣、必將實施一種普遍徵兵制、但各部落對徵兵制均極反對、則恐引起紛亂、錫氏並贊成用殘暴手段、衆信擾亂情形如有進展、世人必將轉移其注意巴力斯坦阿拉伯民族聯合運動之目光、在另一方面、倘使伊拉克各部落果眞叛變、中東一帶恐將陷於不安矣、薩萊門新閣就職後、曾表示願與英國維持原來之友誼、又據報達消息、此次雅辛將軍之內閣、幸提出辭職、否則伊拉克陸軍恐將前來首都、用武力解散之、流血慘禍、卽難倖免、當時伊國軍隊均集中於報達東北七十哩之圭拉格汗地方、當時曾有陸軍飛機多架、在報達上空、擲下小册子甚多、皆係由錫氏署名、要求雅辛內閣速行辭職、並稱閣員之中頗多因私害公之徒、故陸軍方面必須加以驅逐云、隨後各機又擲下炸彈四枚、以示警吿、結果重傷一人、受輕傷者的數十人、雅辛內閣見此形勢、遂立卽官佈辭職、新首相薩萊門今日發表通吿、囑全國人民安居樂業、母相驚擾、昨日城中商肆均閉門、惟地方情形尙稱安謐、大的今日卽可恢復常態、（三十一日路透社電）</p>
<p>開羅　聞伊拉克政界之强有力者耶發將軍今日在報達被槍斃、將軍乃前內閣國防大臣、爲新政府主要讎敵、自暴力政變發生後、卽避匿云、（三十一日路透電）</p>

<p>大馬　伊拉克前任首相雅辛將軍、離國赴比勞斯地方、今日道出此間、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）伊拉克王國於日昨發生政變、雅星將軍所組織之內閣被迫辭職、頃據英國駐伊拉克大使館報吿消息、此項政變並未具有軍事性質、雅星內閣爲其政敵所迫、提出辭職後、業已由國王茄齊費沙爾任命蘇萊曼組織新內閣、閣員七人、蘇萊曼自任總理兼內務部長、政潮遂吿平息、按照一九三〇年英伊兩國條約、英國本已承認伊拉克爲獨立國、對於維持伊拉克國內治安、自不負有何種義務、惟若事變發展、足以影響英國在伊拉克利益時、則英國駐埃及京城之軍隊兩旅、駐巴勒斯丁之軍隊一旅、均準備出動、以防萬一云、（三十一日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>美國總統競選　失業問題重要　羅斯福將主修改憲法　規定最多工時最小工資</h3>
<p>（紐約）羅斯屬總統迄今關於其連任後之政綱、甚少宣露、但衆料羅氏對於其政敵共和黨總統候選人蘭登、所指責全國復興處之各節、將發驚人宣言、以答覆之、民主黨員對於共和黨一再宣布目下全國失業者仍有一千一百萬人之多、深知此種言論影響甚巨、故料羅總統將續定方案、鼓勵僱工、職是之故、或將修正憲法、俾得依全國之規模、制定最多之工時、最小之工資、昨日垣街有人以九千元對五千元賭羅總統之必可重行當選、據全國選民登記之數觀之、此决投票者可較一九三二年增加五百萬人左右、其總數的四千五百萬人、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>布魯克林　羅斯福總統今日在布魯克林音樂研究院演說、坪擊社會安全法之敵人、稱十一月三日美國人民將稱道該法爲要舉、社會安全法乃係保障美國工人之新憲章、開明僱主敎會人士慈善家及敎育家均贊成該法、卽共和黨衆議員亦已有六十七人表示同情、反對者僅十八人、至參院方面、共和黨參議員贊成該法者十五人、反對者僅五人而已、今竟否認君等之參衆議員豈非令人不解、現聞肆無忌憚之僱主利用金錢收買工人、行施壓迫、此無異榨取工人血汗、實不足爲訓、總統對於水旱災工賑機關、官稱此項機關不僅救饑饉、失業、並挽回失望云、（三十日國民電）</p>
<p>（紐約）羅斯福總統今日在此間發表選舉運動最後一分鐘演說、是否將發表關於全國復興處之興奮宣言、一般人對此頗多猜測、前總統胡佛在丹佛演說、謂羅總統在任所提出之各種計畫、渠任總統時多加拒絕、因足延緩國家之復興故也、前全國復興處總裁的翰森將軍在沃克拉菲瑪演說、預料羅總統必續獲大勝利、共和黨候選人藍敦氏能否獲六州之選票、尙屬可疑云、（三十一日路透電）</p>

<h3>晉省局勢之動向　新政施行後上下頓呈朝氣　嚴防漢奸並抗議日機飛幷</h3>
<p>太原通信、晋省偏處西北、交通梗寨、渦去在國內的政局裏、無論就軍事上、政治上、以及經濟文化上、雖並不佔着若何軍要地位、然近以國難嚴重、華北乖危、某方秣馬厲兵精極西侵之會、晋省局勢、遂不僅已形成西北國防之最前綫、實已繫乎華北政局之重心、故晋省最近之景象若何、勳向若何、亟堪注意、爰略紀其情况如下、</p>
<p>厲行新政</p>
<p>晋省自民元迄今、所有重政大權、除關於政治部份民初曾由部派省長分理數載外、民四五問、閣錫山卽以督軍而兼省長、形成一貫之政局、民十九、閻會一度離晋、民二十冬、閻由大連歸來、中央畀以太原綏靖主任職、統理晋綏兩省、於是晋省一切設施、仍為閻負責主持、顧閻在其政治之生命史上、素以趙戴文為其最得力之輔翼、二十餘載、無間朝夕、事無鉅細、必親躬諮詢、以彼此志同道合、感情甚洽也、本年夏間、晋主席徐永昌辭職、趙乃奉中央命繼任、就職以後、與閻共同督促軍政人員、一致埋頭苦幹、在最近晋政中、最為當局所勞力並已確實舉辦者、的有數端、（一）公務員實行早操、（二）公務員一律改換短裝、（三）訓練各級公務員·縣長·各縣主辦公道團人員·各縣教育局長·各縣高小校長·各縣高中學生、最近並將調訓全省各縣村長及商人等、（四）實行禁烟禁賭、（五）令各機開學校、每日舉行升旗降旗典禮、（六）嚴防漢奸活動、（七）整飭社會風化取　飯館女招待·女理髮館等、（八）嚴懲貪官污吏、實行閻氏呈准中央所規定遺誤罪條、以上各項、殆為新政之犖犖大者、且因為早操與改服短裝之故、軍民上下、頓呈朝氣、各級公務人員以及多數民衆、多巳　風景從、蓋已盡穿褐色或灰色之短裝衣服矣、</p>
<p>嚴禁烟賭</p>
<p>晋省於厲行新政之中、復嚴禁烟賭、當趙就職之初、卽飭由公安局畏稈樹榮、召集各大飯店旅館經理、確實負責具結、嗣後各該店館、絕不得冉窩賭聚娼吸食烟毒等情事發生、違者定以槍决處罪、於是一紙明令、立卽澄淸、至於晋省烟政、民三四間、確已絕種、卽吸食姻民、在民七八間、經閻列為六政中三害之一、確實嚴禁、雷厲風行、伊時每兩姻土、直漲至二十餘元、尚屬無從購買、剩餘少數烟民、旣感於法令　嚴、未敢嘗試、益以價値過昂、何從籌此鉅欵、日供消耗、於是不待官禁、而多已先行自禁、民十以還、當局以日忙軍事、對於烟禁、改取罰金辦法、因是遂無形巾漏下一大空隙、藍卽烟禁尚未肅淸、而紅色黃灰色各式各樣之金丹、北自津石、南自鄭洛、偷渡暗運、源源而來、晋民初以為係戒烟藥品、相率服用、常局亦未深切注意、嚴加取締、烟民用之旣久、積而成癮、輾轉傳染、蔓延日廣、姻禍未及淸除、丹毒則又普遍肆猖、至步金丹之後塵而來者、復有料麵等最烈性之毒品、據官方最近統計、晋民近十數年來所受毒禍之損失、有形無形、直達十餘萬萬元之鉅、晋省近年民窮財盡、元氣虧損、殆已不可救藥、廠結所在、其在此乎、民二十間、省府改組、徐永昌主晋、痛恨丹毒之烈、乃由省府特設查禁毒品委員會、任省委馬駿為委員長、釐定單行條例、呈准中央施行、凡在晋　販運發售金丹料麵而被查獲者、無論鉅細、悉予槍決、吸食者亦均分別判處有期或無期徒刑、數年以來、全省執行槍决之是項毒犯、幾達千數以上、自該會厲行查禁以來、丹料之禍、乃始消減、官方在開始禁毒之際、經多方研究、為易於收效起見、曾由省府禁烟考核處、官製戒姻藥餅種、以替替代、藥餅原料、强半卽屬烟土、依成色之高些、分為甲乙丙三種、每塊一兩、外貼印花、發由特許各商號代售、當局原發售之意、純欲藉以贊代丹料、迅速撲滅毒禍、是項姻土、大部運土綏陝兩省、現當局禁毒之計劃、旣已完成、決依中央禁烟規定、厲行禁烟政策、已將舊日所設之查禁毒品委員會及禁烟考核處等機關、悉行裁撒、另組山西禁姻督辦公署、由閻目任督辦、趙任會辦、馬駿等任襄辦坐辦、正式成立、開始辦公、意於姻禁之完成、茲已由該署制定禁姻禁毒員施大綱、及各縣村公道團部協助辦法、宣佈實行矣、</p>
<p>防範漢奸</p>
<p>邇來謠言繁興、各地漢奸、轉蠢盜思動、允以省垣及晉北大同一帶為甚、晉省為嚴加防範計、對於防止漢奸一事、因亦列為最近要政之一、業經制定條例、宣佈施行、飭由各縣軍警及公道團人員、一體戒備、准由人民報告、依章領取賞金、倘敢誣告、則以陷害論罪、比法的與本年防止共匪告發辦法、差為相似、</p>
<p>與防止漢奸而有連帶關係者、則為日方在幷組繼特務機關、先是客冬晋省盛倡防共時期、日方卽派員來幷、與當局商洽、並藉口探訪匪情、要求在幷組織特務機關、派員常川駐幷、伊時當局以旣探訪性筫、故僅允派駐研究員一二人、自是日方卽派遺武官、且在新成街等處、建築樓房、隱以特務機關自居、繼則日人往來日繁、每週一四、且例有日機來臨、月前經當局提出交涉、日方始允不再派機來幷、至所　特務機關、自和知調津後、一切進行、似巳暫趨沈寂、至大同方面、以地臨平綏鐵道、適居察綏兩省要衝、自較太原情形為尢複雜、至渶奸問題、在幷垣以深居內地、交通梗塞、且秩序井然、民多善良、故頗少活動餘地、益以當局列為要政、嚴加防範、以最近情况觀察、似可不至深慮、又幷市軍警憲各機關、連日巳於街市增加崗位、嚴密戒備、冀以防患於未然、</p>

<h3>工商業昨隱度十底　市面活潑三行拆放減少　錢業借欵均已先後歸還</h3>
<p>昨日為滬工商業之十底比期、各業因準備充足、均告穩度、中中交三行雖照常辦理同業拆放、因市面活潑、拆放减少、錢業借欵均已先援歸還、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>銀根寬鬆</p>
<p>中央中國交通三銀行、為調劑同業金融起見、聯合組織拆放委員會辦理各行莊拆放事宜、凡各行莊均得以道契貨物債券等、向該會申請拆放、今年之十月底、各業均因農產品豐收、購買力增强、甚為活潑、所以滬市銀根寬鬆、各行莊向中中交三銀行申請拆放减少、例如錢業市塲昨日上下午兩市之洋拆仍為八分、足見銀根寬鬆、</p>
<p>穩度十底</p>
<p>各業對今年之十底、均已有相當準備、同時滬甬錢莊對到期之信用長期欵項、均予通融展期、所以昨日雖為十底此期、市場上並無緊急現象、與往年之十底則大不相同、各錢莊新做出之信用長期放欵、利息對信用好者、祇在八元至十元之間、至於展期至明年四底之手續、業已完全辦妥、各業均告穩度十底之難關、</p>
<p>借款歸還</p>
<p>各錢莊於去年端節、向中中交三銀行拆放委員會所拆借之一千八百萬元、經各承借錢莊絡續歸還後、今祗辦理收帳之恒賚·恒興·兩莊所借之欵未歸還、今該兩莊已設怯收取放出之欵、以便歸遠日行借欵、但是項借欵均有確實担保品、所以三行一再允該兩莊展期歸還、因係調劑同業金融、其利息為長年八釐、</p>
<h3>須磨　昨日抵滬　談日本外交方針</h3>
<p>中央社云、日本駐華大使館一等參贊兼駐京總領事須磨、十月二十二日、奉川越大使之命返國、向外務省報告川越大使與張外長交涉調整中日問題經過、並請示今後方針、業已事畢、於昨晨九時三十分、乘法郵輪阿拉米斯號抵滬、日頒署代表高橋到埠歡迎、下輪後、卽赴日領署休息、旋卽與在滬日本外交官吏等會晤、卽於當日下午一時二十五分乘坐特快車入京、晋謁川越大使復命、中央社記者、曾晤須磨於輪决、據談如下、</p>
<p>對我交涉　決不讓步</p>
<p>據須磨談、本人此次奉川越大使之命返國、向外務省報告、並有所請示、因時間匆促、在東京僅留滯兩日、日本朝野對華外交方針、仍秉原定主張、決不讓步、故此來實未携有所謂新訓令、</p>
<p>答記者問　謂有辦法</p>
<p>須磨繼謂、關於中日交涉、是否能和平解决、實難測度、惟據本人觀察、中日交涉、不致破裂、決有辦法、可以和平解决、記者詢以日本對華外交方針、仍秉原定主張、決不讓步、則何能不致破裂、須磨微笑而答曰有辦法决不破裂、至於日本對所謂「華北特殊地位」、及「共同反共」、等問題意見、須磨未作明顯之表示、</p>
<p>信用放欵　未作表示</p>
<p>須磨對東京電傳日本朝野、為增進對華貿易起見，將以英國為藍本、對華作短期信用放欽一事、亦未作切實表示、僅示本人在東京時、尚未聞談及、</p>
<p>午後入京　晉謁川越</p>
<p>須磨下輪援、卽返領署休息、旋卽與大使館海軍武官佐藤中將參事官若杉情報部長吉岡等晤談、卽於下午二十五分、由滬偕若杉·吉岡·曾根書記官等、乘特快車入京、晉謁川越大使復命、至川越與我張外長第七决會晤日期、俟須磨抵京後、再行商定云、</p>
<h3>港滬間本月五日通航　中英通航同時實現　爲遠東航空界開一新紀元　中美全綫通航亦實行在即</h3>
<p>中國航空公司、昨正式發表、香港站定十一月五日通航、同日亦實行與英國皇家航空公司正式銜接、直接通航、中美全綫在本月內亦將正式開航、據神州社記者探誌詳情如决、</p>
<p>港站本月　五日通航</p>
<p>昨據中國航空公司負責人正式發表關於中國航空公司、在香港設立航站事、現已由中英雙方接洽妥當、英政府之允許執照、已由中航公司領到、航站各項設備、正在積極進行、刻定十一月五日、正式通航、該日上午六時三十分、由滬起飛、當日下午二時四十五分抵港、北上機定六日上午七時三十分、由港啟飛、當日下午三時四十五分抵港、開航之初、仍每星期來回各飛行三次，現初次航港旅客票預定者極為踴躍、視情形需要、將酌量增加班次、以應需要、滬港間客票價、計單位二百元、來回三百九十元、</p>
<p>中英通航　同時實行</p>
<p>此次主辦港站通航事宜者、中國方面為中國航空公司、英國方面為皇家航空公司、故香港設站、自五日起實行後、中航滬粤綫與英皇家航空遠東航綫，亦將同日起實行正式接銜通航、此後中英旅客及郵件、均可由上海經中英聯運綫抵達倫敦、從此東西兩大國間之空間交通、　可以互相連接、行旅殊多便利，亦遠東航空界之一新紀元云、</p>
<p>中美亦將　全綫貫通</p>
<p>中美航錢、經中航公司港站實現、亦將於最短期內實行全綫通航、此次汎太平洋航空公司總經理屈立伯及董事長威特耐兩氏試飛中美全綫完成、並在華視察、俟屈威兩氏返美决定援、中美全綫通航日期、卽可公佈、屈氏現已由港轉道倫敦返美、威特耐夫婦及美新聞鉅子霍華德氏、亦已於昨晨由滬搭中航機飛粤轉港，搭輪赴馬尼拉搭中美機返美、中美綫在最短期中通航後、則遠東方面中英·中法·中美·三主要幹綫、均將宣告完成、</p>
<p>新機運華　應付需要</p>
<p>中航公司滬粤錢港站通航後、預定客郵必極擁擠、故該公司前已預向美國訂購大號賽可斯水上機兩架，同時可容十六人左右、內部設備亦枸極完全、預定本年年底前後可運華、屆時卽將配置滬粤錢飛航、並將擴充班次、另外尚有DC　三號道格拉斯巨型陸上機、亦將繼續運華應用、</p>

<p>再以九十兩月比較、去年九月份上海雨量、為四寸八分今年九月則祗一寸七分、去年十月雨量為一寸七分二、今年十月、則根本無片雨滴水下降、此種秋旱情形、實為近年來所少見、無怪四郊農民、已望雨殷切、又悉揚子江流域、今年雨量尚較上海為少、故江水日涸、自屬理所必然、</p>
<p>昨晨濃霧</p>
<p>連日夜間、上海迭見霧氣氤氳、尤以昨晨之霧最為濃重、咫尺之間、殊難辨識人面、浦江溟濛、宛被大霧凝鎖、故一時帆檣、均暫停欃棹、至進日輪船、停留口外者尤多、是項重霧、直已上午九時竣、始行消散、水上交通卽復、同時中航公司滬漢機、昨晨起飛時間、亦有躭延云</p>

<h3>車夫互助會　創辦車夫保險　會員四萬全體保險　賠欵中死亡佔多數</h3>
<p>按勞動保險、在歐美各國、行之已久、其坊效之宏大、亦早爲一般人士所稱道、返觀我國則迄今尙不多見、殊堪引爲遺憾、但本埠公共租界人力車夫互助會、巳於本年勞動節（五月一日）起、開始辦理車夫保險、賠欵迅速、成效卓著、實開我國勞動保險之先聲、且其規模頗大、受保險者、達四萬一千餘人、更爲遠東之冠、堪供我國熱心社會福利人士之參考、謹節錄於下、</p>
<p>組織</p>
<p>該會對於車夫死亡殘廢事件、原有互濟部專司救濟之資、惟爲加強車夫保障起見、爰於本年五月一日特設會員保險部、一决提撥經費三萬元、成立保險委員會·由理事會推定朱懋澄·柯幹臣·陸衛理·嚴成德·仇子同·韓玉珊·何武山·股芝齡·八人爲委員、由朱懋澄担任主席、嚴成德充會計、均爲義務性質、經理一席、由該會總幹事張登瀛兼任、亦不另支薪、故該部開支、至爲經濟、</p>
<p>辦法</p>
<p>至保險辦法、經規定凡登記車夫、每人保險賠欵、爲國幣四十元、車夫因任何原因死亡者、觸犯死刑者不在此例、）或因遭意外危險及其他原因、致失去雙肢·雙手·幾足·或一足一手者、或致雙目失明者、或致一目失明及一手或一足終生殘廢者、槪賠全數、凡因遭意外危險、或其他原因、而致一目失明者、或致一手或一足終生殘廢者、賠欵半數、且賠欵極爲迅速、在可能範圍內、必須於二十四小時內付給之、據該會負責人報告、該項保險、自開辦以來、至本年九月底止、賠欵案件巳有一百十二起、計賠去國幣未超五千元云、</p>
<p>分析</p>
<p>又據該會分析、所有一百十二起賠欵案件中、以死亡爲最大多數、計一百零七件、佔百分之九十五强、殘廢者計僅九件、而死亡之中、以息地方病流行病及傳染病爲最多、計五十九人、包括腸熱病　十三人、回歸性熱病六人、瘧疾病五人、痢疾六人、呼吸器管癆病十六人、流行性感胃、腦膜與申樞神經茶癆病及第三期梅毒各一人、普通崁病計六人、包括肝胃癌與惡性腫二人、腹膜腸及直腸癌及其他惡性腫一人、慢性風濕病、骨關節炎及痛風二人、脚氣一人、循環系疾病四人、包括心絞痛及其他心臟病者二人、呼吸器病計八人包括喉病一人、肺炎氣喘各二人枝氣管炎二人、其他呼吸器病一人、消化器系十八人、其中以腹瀉及腸炎佔十二人、胃病四人、其他消化器病二人、泌尿半殖器之非花柳病一人、又該死亡車夫一百零七人中、其年齡以四十五歲至四十九歲爲最多、計二十三人、四十歲至四十四歲十九人、二十五歲至二十九歲、三十歲三十四歲各十三人、三十五歲至三十九歲、五十歲至五十四歲各十二人、平均計算起來、多在四十歲左右、佔三分之二、以此推算、每個車夫、能生存四十三歲、可見車夫生活之一斑矣、</p>

<h3>弁言</h3>
<p>— 許紹棣</p>
<p>浙江自唐宋以來，久爲文物之邦，在中國文化史上，兩浙實有無限之光榮。近年浙江建設事業猛進之中，敎育界亦未敢自懈，在物力艱難之中，力謀多方之改進，薄有成效之可言。嘗以爲敎育事業，對象至廣，而方面亦至多。學校敎育於史地公民各　科之中，固當致意於鄉邦先賢事蹟之講誦，以激起其景仰興起之感。而欲宏溥其效。尤當藉社會敎育之方式，使一般民衆咸能感受其熏沐。斯則展覽之義尚焉。</p>
<p>民國二十三年時，浙省曾舉行省情展覽會，頗富鄉土敎育之意義，惟陳列範圍較廣，於本省先賢之文獻蒐集其鮮。敎育廳近年旣時以表揚先代人文責諸各地圖書館民敎館，復於二十四年度列入舉辦浙江文獻展覽會之計劃；而以省立圖書館蒐藏新舊圖書，平　頗措意於本省文獻之蒐集與整理，爰屬該館主辦其事。以籌備需時，始於本年十月一日開幕。第徵訪之際，曾在木省各專員區及京平滬設徵品分會，並由廳令各縣長從事徵集，並先在各縣或合在本區舉行展覽，會後擇尤送省。集省內外之羣力，徵集鄉賢著作字畫遺像拓片各種文物頗夥，此則深用慰幸者也。</p>
<p>展覽之宗旨，在乎闡揚浙省文獻，推進　術敎育，已詳本會緣起。惟本人所欲爲省人士與參觀諸君進一言者，卽吾人觀於展覽各種文物，固可見前代刻本美術之精，但吾人所應注意者，决不僅在此形式。吾人應就其物以想見其人，知吾浙先賢之如何篤學力行，如何公忠體國，如何以一身繫民族之安危存亡，至於爲國家捨生命身家而不惜。此種鄉賢偉大磅礴之精神，　應爲吾人所深予體會，發揚光大者。蓋由此以興與愛鄉之感，因愛鄉以激發其民族精神，以自獻於吾多難之國家。　幾展覽之事，不致有玩物喪志迷戀過去之譏，而能發揮其深切之敎育意義也。展覽會將在日報編印特刊，爰畫所感以弁其端。</p>
<h3>浙江文獻展覽會之旨趣</h3>
<p>— 陳訓慈</p>
<p>海通以還，風會漸移。浙江文物之邦，對于今日之學術事業雖　多方面之靖獻，而于先代人文表揚考訂之業，則浸以荒墜。故典舊　，研治漸稀，徵文考獻，識者興歎。浙江省立圖書館承文瀾之舊緒，萃新故之典籍，居恒常盡力于本省文獻之徵存與表揚。此次秉承敎廳之命，舉行浙江文獻展覽會，賴省內外各界諸君之匡助，徵品差已琳琅可觀。展覽之始，願就管見所及，揭述四義，以明斯會之旨趣，且與海內賢達相商榷焉。</p>
<p>一曰徵存鄉　之著作兩浙學者，著述如林。四庫著錄，達一千三百九十家，爲書七四三種，合存目都二二六八種。其爲四庫所失收，與乾隆後著作不及收者，允難勝數。其間成稿未刊，或已印而罕傳者，復何可量？方今私家藏書式微，圖書館又欲蒐訪而絀于資力。今茲展覽，彙浙省七十餘縣，及省內外藏家之所徵集，不惟名家原稿精較，足資比勘，而岩棲韋布之士，尤將就此徵闡幽表微之效。會後物歸原主，浙館縱無力盡最孤本以爲錄副；而留目公世，亦要足供學者之徵訪，傳先哲之精英已。</p>
<p>二曰發揚浙江之學風吾浙文化之開發，旣得力于晋宋、一决之民族南遷，故學術亦自南宋以後爲盛。此後宗風相傳，鄉習濡染，卓然漸樹，其特殊之學風。如博大而能守約，寬容而不立門戶，篤學而不忽踐履，經世而趨重實用，在近數百年吾浙學者中，往往有其共通精神之可尋。而經學理學文學以逮象敎之學，吾浙皆代有魁碩，成分途並進之盛。如今次展覽之所彰示，尤可見兩浙所歷代學風之美焉。惜自世變益亟，士趨近功，潛修之風尚漸替，浙學之中衰可懼。將何以闡發吾歷代鄉賢之優美學風，繼承而光大之，固吾浙　下所常共淬勵以赴。抑浙人素無封域之見，大師名儒之敎澤，常遠被夫他鄉。審夫自淑淑人之道，浙人將何以重振其學風，而吾邦人將何以共汲浙之佳風而更醇化之，而轉移全國之趨向以臻于健全，應尤爲斯會之重大使命也。</p>
<p>三曰整理地方之文獻本敬恭桑梓之念，以從事于鄉邦文獻之蒐輯與表揚者，在吾浙爲夙著。宋儒王深寗之四明文獻集，可爲顯例。淸中葉以後，輯刊鄉先賢著作以爲叢書之風，亦以浙省爲獨盛。後先相繼，至今不絕。（台州叢書最先，近年則有仙居叢書，處州叢書，四明叢書規模尤閎，在續梓中）顧風會遷轉，在上者旣不如昔賢之勤于倡率。私人之物力又遜于前古。于是名賢著作，寖就湮淪，古蹟名勝，亦乏整理，即如一省通志，失修且二百年；金石志之輯，亦未聞有續阮文達之緒者。吾人觀夫今茲展覽文物之所題記，卽可懍一地文獻散佚之易；則凡文獻整理之業，如祠墓之修葺，金石之保存。以至邑乘省志之重修，與夫平日志料之保存，皆省縣常局與地方有心之士所應量力以赴者。省會首善之區，縱在明恥修武爲尚之今日，竊謂如興修孔廟，剏建碑林，籌修通志，固並有繫于政敎之重，正應早圖而未可或緩也。</p>
<p>四曰推進愛鄉　國之精神　愛鄉愛國，其源一揆，表裏相維，誼無偏廢。浙人士素篤梓桑，亦惟吾浙人文爲最有繫于民族之安危存亡。溯之上古，勾踐之發憤興國，實先樹之典型。厥後東晋偏安，二謝以一戰保大局；臨安定都，宗忠簡（澤）以留守阻敵氛。在明則有宋濂）劉（基）之佐成帝業，于忠肅之安奠社稷。明季兩浙忠烈蔚起，寗波錢忠介（肅樂）張蒼水（煌言）東陽張玉笥（國維）其尤著者。清季革命之役，克奉膚功，亦多兩浙英雋之捨身成仁，或以文字輔其成焉。此次展覽，周爰咨諏，間關徵訪，于此類有關表章往哲，導揚民氣之文獻，尤三致意；舉凡革命先烈與有功民族之浙賢，其遺像遺書遺物，罔不竭力以求。區區微尚，豈第在表揚一省之人物，要期張此偉大磅礴之氣。使浙人以至舉國志士咸聞風而興起耳。良以値茲國運方艱，外侮孔棘，此愛鄉衛國之精神，自尤應爲國人所共具；願覽者細察深省，以期準往策來之效，毋徒以硃墨紛披，存迷戀往古之感，蹈玩物喪志之譏也</p>
<p>大抵輓近吾國展覽之舉，不外三型；或則羅列文物，考鏡學術；或則蒐求物產，獎進實業；或惟敷陳書畫，供人鑒賞。南方名都大邑，以時會之需求，頗重其次，而杭垣靡麗尚文，書畫展覽亦較多。至若學術意味之文物展覽，則素推舊京爲特盛。浙館此次展覽，意欲於闡揚浙省文獻之外，收推進學風之助。縱未能遂有轉移風氣之效，亦竊願爲較廣之文物展覽試其初桄。徵訪之際，旣在本省九專昌區及南京北平上海分設徵品分會，更有各地賢達，惠而好我，投借多珍者，其大要則以浙人士製作或與浙有關者爲歸。木省各區專昌縣長，地方父老，以逮省外之學術機關與學者，多方贊助，深用銘感。本會果能粗有可觀，略著成效，要皆諸公匡護之賜，至若陳列未當，考撰疏舛，則浙館同人所應向蒞覽者告罪，而求其指正者也。（二十五年十月二十八日記于浙江圖書館）</p>
<h3>浙江文獻與近世中國之關繫</h3>
<p>— 柳詒徵</p>
<p>近世中國，惟浙江之文獻關係最鉅，蒙古荒而明興，朱氏雖起濠泗，而　亮謨謀，肇造區夏，義烏金華靑田諸公之力也，　閩學統，盛極而衰，陽明乃易其幟，屹爲一代宗主，蕞山梨洲，蟬嫣不替，流衍至於鄰域。浙江之於華夏，於亞洲，光靈若是其偉也。滿淸痛鋤刈浙士，浙士蜷伏於淫威，文藝撰著，愈益宣寫其靈秀，而遺民之恫國族之思，隱隱　　，刀鋸屠戮，翎頂利祿，莫能摧而腐之也。山陰餘杭，匹夫匹婦，力能乘長白之敝，捐身命而覆其鼎，運會所極，紛攘廿年，從河山破碎中，持文敎，實業，黨治，軍力，奔走搏控天下，亦惟浙之英傑矣。嗚呼，浙之人　荷中國五六百年，繫浙之文獻旁魄陶冶所表者也，時艱日棘，來軫方遒，僕願觀斯會者，持吾言以爲鍼果，益恢先哲之志量，與我華夏，又我亞洲，則斯會之影響，豈徒域於一省一地已哉。</p>
<p>文獻展覽之擬附日報出特刋，爲時已遲，徵稿允倉卒。丹徒柳翼謀先生覆示，卽以時促未爲專文，而以題辭答其所請，茲爲便於閱者，輒就文意爲妄擬一題如此，維柳先生與讀者諒之。</p>
<h3>浙江文獻展覽珍品述要</h3>
<p>— 槎客</p>
<p>浙省此次舉辦文獻展覽，徵品進行，雖不無受時局之影響，幸賴各地公私藏家熱心贊助，用能珍品駢羅，琳琅滿目。所惜爲時忽促，各地徵品到會，先後參差不一，點檢登記，審查分類，手續復極繁重，致未克預輯全目，以餉覽者。茲但先就編記所及，擇尤簡介於右，藉示一斑。</p>
<p>徵品範圍，徧及南北，惟應徵者要以本省爲多。截至十月二十六止，收到文物，總數已達二萬餘件，六千餘種；甄別取舍，亦去過半。其間堪稱精貴者，（一）鄉賢遺稿如·明山陰張岱手稿石匱書（卽世傳爲谷應泰所剽竊者）及陶庵維稿；諸曁陳洪綬手寫　綸堂集初稿，永嘉吳彥匡花史，靑田王一中靖匪錄，以迄　天台齊召南玉芝堂文集手稿，瑞安孫詒讓名原手稿，定海黃以周儆季雜著原稿，餘杭章炳麟訄書手稿等。（三）校本如：嘉興錢泰吉手抄手校老子道德經，瑞安孫詒讓校禮書通故。（三）鈔本如：明徐渭手寫文集，淸查初白手寫詩，並爲書林瑰物。（四）鄉賢遺像尤多罕見，自吳越錢武肅王像外，若宋揚慈湖像（明季繪），明劉文成一世授經圖（陳老蓮繪），王文成公七代合像，范東明（欽）像，淸毛西河全謝山像，西河與朱竹垞台像，（丁小雅繪　紀昀程晋錢大昕等題詠）張蒼水錢忠介像，其他遺像之攝成大照片者，無慮百數。（五）鄉賢遺物，以國人保藏之不措意與藏家之珍惜，故徵借最難。然所蒐致者，如錢武肅王天册堂寳玉印，元梅花道人嘉興吳仲圭書硯，明雲和王懷彬朝笏，海鹽鄭曉禦倭時用鐵盔，張蒼水公遺硯，（慈谿楊氏藏，甚珍貴）樂淸河山人白遺硯，淸天台陳桂芬武狀元之羽林甲，嘉興張叔未跋秦度等。其間爲革命先烈之遺物，則與其遺墨等，別闢爲（六）民族革命文獻一部（仍限於浙人），因徵訪之不易，蒐得有限。然如光復會首領會糟陶煥卿殉難前三日鉛筆書之光復會歷史，嘉興敖夢姜之秘密宣傳品祖宗敎福書及禱祠，山陰徐伯蓀早歲繪中國沿海圖，並爲國人所罕見，不如秋烈女遺墨及山陰諸烈遺像之曾在本省展覽者。至如陳英士先生之血衣，爲湖社所珍藏，向不輕以公世。此次由本會多方商洽，得以携以供衆瞻仰，應與湖上銅像相輝映焉。（七）鄉賢遺墨選存五百餘軸，尤美不勝收，其著者如元吳鎭倣米山水，明瑞安任道遜山水直幅，諸曁陳老蓮溪山讀書圖，蕭山毛西河書玉　瓏石立軸，錢塘戴文節公墨竹，此外佳作，更難僕數。若宋錢唐夏珪書則以眞僞可疑，岳忠武遺墨眞蹟，臨海葛孝先手札，則以萬賢作品，尚未數計焉。其他（八）刻書文獻，則有自傳世　古刻本之湖州天寗寺發現後周顯德刋「　篋陀羅尼經」（較雷峯塔經卷稱早二十年）宋監本陳解元書籍舖本，元西湖書院本以迄明淸浙省精槧，應有盡有，可作浙江刻書史觀。（九）藏書文獻，自明范氏天一閣祁氏　　淡生堂，淸朱氏潛采堂鮑氏知不足齋以迄丁氏八千卷樓孫氏玉海樓等藏本，咸擇要陳列，其尤罕覯者如嚴久能跋藏周益公書稿宋本，潛采堂藏吳梅村手抄臨浦周先生集，尤稱書林瑰寳（十）選舉文獻，蒐雜明淸鄉試錄極夥，寗波天一閣之明代登科錄，並擇要大宗應徵，共中最觸目者，尤數明山陰祁承燦祁彪佳父子鄉會試硃卷原本，及張氏涉園之消初海鹽張惟赤赴宴麻鳴之銀杯，亦（鄉賢遺物之列）台州徵集之淸天台陳省欽進氏衣曁殿試等等。（十一）榓案徵集最少，然如淸順治間之大學士胡兆龍糾舉張大捷訐告湖州進士沈　行賄案奏摺，嘉慶十四年浙撫阮元題本，以迄餘杭縣抄存楊乃武案定　　稿等，亦殊有價値（十二）浙省地方志蒐羅極富，自宋版四明志赤城志以迄明淸諸志，除浙館三十年來所收者外，復萃天一閣嘉業樓九峯舊　北平圖書館金陵大學及其他私家之珍藏，用能合流衆長，蔚爲大觀。（十三）圖表有新維浙江歷史地理各圖四十幅，暨化平圖書館借陳之明淸浙省舊輿圖等，亦尚粲備。而建設機關所送各種經濟交通圖尚不與。（十四）譜牒一門，明淸本省各地大娃家乘，浙館原有蒐集，益以地方徵借，亦多陳列。就中尤以諸曁楓橋陳氏寳藏之宋代宗譜量稱名貴，譜首有紹興十五年宗高宗御題，陳省筆陳堯佐堯咨等四像贊，並「皇宋之章」國璽，聞各地宋元舊牒，傳世者頗不鮮，然能慨假本會陳列，僅此一種，允爲譜中裒首，不易得覩者。（十五）金石拓片，此次陳列者金石原物甚少，所陳如吳越金塗塔與唐石經幢亦頗珍貴，拓片則合浙館歷年之所蒐　與各方之送徵者，至爲夥頥，其中沂拓之外，亦間有唐宋舊物。（十六）碑帖陳列非夥，有東陽本蘭亭，而孫涉甫先生應徵之南唐澄心堂紙所榻王右軍洛神賦爲淸內府舊藏，朱章斑斑可考，雖非與浙江文獻有特殊之關聯，要爲斯道之尤物也。微集文物旣夥，屬稿陳列未竣，倉卒編記，掛漏失當，願俟他日詳考而細述之。（編者案：此次展覽品目及題記，將在浙江圖書館出版之文瀾學報二卷二四合期展覽專輯中揭布之）</p>

<h3>給讀者的信</h3>
<p>— 施瑛</p>
<p>「國難的故事」代序</p>
<p>我的讀者：</p>
<p>我常常想要明白這一會事：我們的國家，為什么現在到了這個地步呢？滅亡的危險，已經臨到了我們的眼睛前面，我們的弟兄，有的已經做了別人的奴才，有的快要套上奴才的鎖鍊。難道眞像我們的大人先生所說一樣，我們中國人是注定的苦命嗎？我不相信。我去找尋書本，讀了許多歷史書；這些書本裏，有各種不同的記載。它們告訴我說，我們的國家，從前有過光榮的時代，有過許多値得驕傲的地方。但自從外國的大老闆們到中國來做生意之後，便呌中國一天不如一天。中國的國勢從强盛落到現在的破敗樣子，還不到一百年的時間。——這些書本上的記載，總算呌我滿足了。但是我爲了找尋這些東西，費了好久的功夫，讀了幾尺厚的書本；我想現在每一個中國人，都有像我一樣的疑問，都要明白這一會事，可是未必每個人有功夫像我一樣的做。我要把我所知道的東西，講出來，讓大家知道。但是我的文筆很拙劣，不能够像那批戴方帽子的先生們一樣，原原本本地奧深地做得像大學裏的講義；或者用很好看的辭句寫成激昂慷慨有聲有色的文章。好得我的讀者，看學校裏的講義總怕頭痛，讀激昂慷慨的文章，結果又怕太空洞，得不到什麼。還是讓我像鄉下土老兒一樣，用頂通俗的話寫出來吧。我不會說什麼專門的名詞，我不怕有人說我的東西粗俗，不像什麼文章。我只照我的意思來寫，盡我的能力寫得淸楚好懂，免得讀者看不下去。</p>
<p>我不情願在我的書裏，提起許多嚕囌的人名，這批人所以能够在歷史上留下名字，大都不是他們自己的緣故。我們所需要知道的，是我們大家，我們的國家，爲什麼會到現在的地步。至於那批大人物，我們也不必去硬記他們的名字；他們中的大部分除了替自己打算以外，難得有好處給我們。我的讀者只要知道很少的幾個名字，也就够了。至於書裏的地名和別的專門名詞，我也儘量少用，不讓讀者爲這些字眼費心。因此我的書更不像學校的講義。可是讀者看過我的書之後，如果能够明白近百年來，我們中國受列强壓迫的情形，那末我的目的就算達到了。</p>
<p>我這本書的名稱，呌國難的故事。最初曾想用「近百年來列强壓迫中國的故事」這名稱的，其實頂有問題的是「近百年」三個字。歷史不是「西洋鏡，」看了一幅又一幅；歷史是一條很長的河流，從發源地流到汪洋大海裏完全是長長的一條，不能够把它一段一段劃分開來。河水海水前浪推後浪地過去，歷史也是有了過去，才有現在，有了現在，才有將來，不能够指定那一年那一月那一天，古代突然變了近代，世界上的東西也都換過了。我在這書裏所寫的故事，從鴉片戰爭的時候寫起；也並不是說在一八四〇那一年，英國人忽然心血來潮，要向中國來尋開心，才發生鴉片戰爭的。許多過去的原因，己經注定了鴉片戰爭的發生了。但是我也沒有辦法；爲了要省掉許多嚕囌的話，我只好快刀斬麻，丟開過去不講，劈頭就說鴉片戰爭。因爲現在中國的情形，完全由過去六七十年的事情所造成，所以這書裏特地把前面的幾件事情，講得詳細一點；近來的事情，讀者耳聞目見，大概總有點印像遺留在腦裏，我便講得簡單一點。不過我不是留聲機器；單單報告一點從新聞紙上得來的消息，是不够的，我所講的自然比較有系統一點。</p>
<p>我不是歷史家，我手頭的書本又不多，所以這本書裏，錯誤一定難免；然在我已經要感謝我的朋友，他們把有價値的書借給我查考；我不是文學家，我的書不能够寫得活龍活現，呌讀者看了有似親身經歷，那是一定的。君蓮是第一個讀這本書的人。她不會進過高深的學校，對於一切學術上的東西，她知道得比我更少。我把我寫好的東西，四她先讀，看她能不能够都明白。如果她不能够明白，那末這段文章己經染上一點斯文氣了，我還得改過。我總是向頂好懂的路上走。</p>
<p>我在等待讀者看後的批評，希望我的讀者，願意告訴我。最後，我還要謝謝開明書店編譯所裏的幾位先生，因爲他們給我不少有價値的指示。</p>
<h3>爲沙梅君評初中唱歌教本進一解</h3>
<p>— 吳夢非</p>
<p>由友人轉來從十月廿六日上海「立報」上剪下來的一叚書評，對拙編「初中唱歌敎本」加以評論，編者除對評者沙梅君表示感謝外，實有幾句要聲明的話：</p>
<p>原評謂：『其中　了「滿江紅」，「靑年生活」，「天風」諸首外，其餘都是塡上中國詞的外國曲子。』其實「天風」也是外國曲子，評者不知它的來源就是，至於「靑年生活」雖是本國旋律，但已由編者另易歌詞。</p>
<p>原評又謂：『把外國歌曲的歌詞翻成中文，這于原曲的情調並沒有損失。可是把外國曲子隨便塡上中國詞，不管它們適合與吾，只要中國詞的字數，能塡進曲子就了事，這簡直說不過去。』這個見解，編者也深表同情，不過也未可一槪而論，我常見到一般人所直譯的外國歌詞，有很多不能和原曲相融合的；又一般敎會所唱的從外國歌詞譯成中文的讚美歌之類，竟有連詞句也不通的，音韻更不必說了。這樣的歌曲，評者以爲不失原來的情調嗎？至於拿外國的曲調，隨便塡上歌詞，固然不行，但如果能够配上互相融合的詞句，也未始不可取，正不必因原曲是讚美上帝，一定得配上讚美什麼的詞句。原來。聲樂曲的表情，往往靠託歌詞底意義而顯現，倘使抹煞了歌詞，也僅能使聽者感到漠然的情調，所以作曲者往往有在曲首標明種種曲趣的文字，如雄壯，美麗，快活，悲哀等（　都用音樂專門名詞），塡歌詞者紙要認定原曲的節奏，不背全曲的意味就是了。倘使在顧到曲情之外，必須再求其詞義完全相同，然後認爲風馬牛相及，恐未免太膠柱鼓瑟吧。</p>
<p>評者所列舉的「思故鄉」「大無畏精神」「廢除不平等條約」三曲，都是編者從別種出版物上選集得來，所以在每曲上各註明作曲者和作歌者的姓名，以明責任，評者豈未見到嗎？但編者所以選用這三曲，當然以爲道三曲大致尚可用——其中除有小部分的詞句略可訾譏外——。「思故鄉」的曲趣是表情的，（E　pressivo）「大無畏精神」的曲趣是偏於優美，「廢除不平等條約」的曲趣是勇壯的，大致能和中文歌詞相洽。沙梅君以爲原曲寫愛情，塡詞也必不出愛情，才合情調嗎？那末：我要講你去翻一翻外國出版的「世界唱歌集」（Songs　the　Whole　World　Sings）其中選集「大無長精神」的原曲有兩首：一首標題題Believe　me　if　all　those　Ende－aring　Young　Charms，另一首却標題Fair　Har－vard．可見外國人也在一曲兩用呢？又「廢除不平等條約」的原曲，固然出於瓦格耐的歌劇中，然而外國人也都另配上Flag　of　the　free的歌詞而唱着呢！（見外國出版的「兒童唱歌集」Songs　the　Children　Love　to　Sing等書）評者見了外國人把「婚禮進行曲」，配了「自由旗」的歌詞，也將笑得閉不上嘴嗎？</p>
<p>總而言之：我國目前的音樂敎材，十分貧乏，照理想上講，最好要創作些詞和曲十分貼切而不能分離的歌曲，編者也正在嘗試中而且已另有發表；至於用外國曲子來塡中文歌詞，原是爲了自己創作，不一定能勝過外國音樂家的作品時底一種權宜辦法。評者也會看到我國敎育部編的「中學音樂敎材集」及「小學音樂敎材集」嗎？其中歌曲，却是費了不少時間，不少手續，向全國各地方收集攏來的，然而結果竟有一大半都是用外國曲子塡了中文歌詞的東西。拙編「初中唱歌教本」雖不敢自信爲完善之作，但竭力避免春花秋月，你愛我憐而無病呻吟的歌曲，也絕無頹傷悲哀底感覺，這是可以自慰的，編者難，評書也不易，質之沙梅君以爲如何？</p>
<h3>青年修養的南針</h3>
<p>— 證</p>
<p>「續愛的教育」——孟德格查著——夏丏</p>
<p>開明書店出版——六角</p>
<p>記得從前自己出了中學，到一家工廠裏去做練習生的時候，對於手頭的工作，總覺得不大滿意。不是認爲太機械，便是感到枯燥乏味。當時也曾讀過幾本坊間買來的關於職業修養的書，但其中所講到的多半只是一些「吃得苦中苦，方爲人上人」等的大道理，一則因爲自覺並浚有吃得「苦中苦」，當然就不想去憧憬「人上人」。再則對於這些老話，我一向就懷疑是一般自己已經爬上人頂的人講的風凉話，有些不願領敎。直到後來，偶然被我買到這本「續愛的敎育」，經過它那忠實而誠懇的解說，突然打開我以往的心情，一條光明而合乎理想的人生大路，淸晰地展在我的眼前了。我開始有了希望，有了憧憬，有了快樂。那些呆板的工作不但不再使我感到乏味，並且還對於它們抱着很大的目的了。</p>
<p>這本書怎樣會有道樣偉大的力量呢？因爲他能以一種親切透澈的解說，來告訴我們對於「做人」應有的態度；使我們知道應該怎樣去對付身邊的環境，怎樣從我們每天所接觸見聞的事物中瀝取豐富的智識和正當的樂趣。「吃得苦中苦，方爲人上人」道句老話，往往會使我們對於不苦的事情也發出苦的感覺，但在這本書裏却明白地告訴我們；在任何正當的事業中是找不出一個「苦」字的，正像在拿破侖的字典中找不出一個「難」字來一般。</p>
<p>這書全用小說體裁寫成，起頭說「愛的敎育」中的主角安利訶到了中學以後，因爲過於用功，生了一塲大病。病好後，被父母送到海邊的舅父家裏去休養。舅父是一個髮已灰白，雄壯而溫和的，「善良的獅子」一般的老人。他對於安利訶抱着眞純而不過奢的希望，用海濤一般的激情，想把他敎養成意大利的一個身心健全的公民。書中大部分都是這位老人的「海獸的咆哮」一般的敎言，另一部分是他在幾僩月中的行動和安利訶被感化的情形，以及幾則値得記誦的動人的故事。</p>
<p>現在我們先來看看書中的舅父是一位怎樣的人物：</p>
<p>舅父的胸中藏滿着豐富的學識，但他的學識同旁人不同。人家的學識是從書本上得來的，他却「從孩時，不曾受過誰的敎，只是用自己的眼睛看，用自己的心思考」而來的。他說：「世上有學校的先生與學校的敎科書所不能敎的世界，對於這世界，你非自去學習不可。」「研究廣大的自然和活世界，較之學校的功課更是重要。」「無論自然的那一角，路上遇見的那一人，都可以成爲自己的活學問。……自然是智慧之母，是先生的老師。」他十歲死了父親，輟了學，去渡航海的生活；後來做了船長還不算，最可喜的，他竟學得了海一般偉大的人格，海一般豐富的學識。他爲什麼會有了這樣的成功的呢？請看一位牧師敎他的名貴的敎言：</p>
<p>「不要灰心，充了船員，也有做船長的希望，只要有志氣，就可以成任何的有名人物。……無論甚麼職業，都不是可恥的。…」</p>
<p>「你從明日起，每朝起來，請先自誓一日中須行三件好的事。晚上睡時請自省今日預定要做的三件好事曾吾實行。這樣行去，你的一生就會沒有一日浪費。只要能如此，你也不必再入學校，不必再待先生的教導了」他聽了這些教言，怎樣地去實行呢？</p>
<p>「…每日在努力着：第一，增進自己的健康，第二，把心弄好，第三，修養思想這樣地做着，直到　老，從未間斷。</p>
<p>他的人格的修養，實在是他一生中最大的成功：</p>
<p>第一，他的外表雖然好像一個野蠻人，但他的胸懷中却充滿正確的「愛」。他不但愛他回憶中的親友，愛他的國家，並且普遍的愛着一切的人。爲了愛，有時他非常嚴厲，有時又變得非常溫和，有時却是非常勇敢。我們看了「犬與人」中，他救護那個被狗咬傷的孩子的情形，誰都不免要對他肅然起敬的吧！看了「猪肉饅頭和悲壯的回憶」中，他用直率的友愛，把一個奸惡的勃羅斯匹浴感化得那樣馴良，誰都不免要流幾滴歡欣之淚的吧！他的愛有時不但施於人類，而且兼及草木。這在「解語的草木」中，就很容易看到。他說：「哪木也和我一樣，能感受，能快樂，能忍耐，並且，可憐！牠們也和我一樣的要死亡！」這是多麼親切的話啊！</p>
<p>第二，他的藝術的素養非常精深。他喜歡兇湧的海洋，又喜歡生命之母的大地。他的心中充滿美麗的詩。他曾經這樣說：「人應都是詩人。人依了希望，有的爲農夫，有的爲漁夫，有的爲工塲工人，有的爲船員，有的爲機械師吧。但無論作何職業，如果其心非詩人之心，不能開出美的人生之花來。」不過他所說的詩是什麼呢？它不是空洞的讚美，也不是無故的悲傷。它是熱血和靈魂的結晶，奮鬥和勝利的微笑。他以爲意大利的光明，都是太詩人但丁的恩赐。因此，他相信詩能救國，只要這樣做去：「對於一切事都不要灰心，抱了希望，積極勇猛前進。如果遇有困難，常認爲新勝利的豫告而期待其將來，又，在正當的事上，非做英雄豪傑不可。爲了顯現美的精神，當不畏一切。」</p>
<p>第三，他爲人正直，果决，和富有責任心。他做事當仁不讓，豪爽，有條理，有眼力。他接濟瘋了手的乞丐，却不上僞慈善者的當。他在幼時因爲失却了借來的僞金幣，便立刻用袋中所有的錢去買了眞的來賠償。他鄙視金錢與虛榮。他願以全力助人，但不願人以虛僞的禮物交換。</p>
<p>在這樣的一本薄薄的書裏，這位老偉人已經把他會經費盡苦心琢磨出來的這些偉大的修養全盤托了出來。他所要敎導和感化的不但是他的外甥安利訶，而且是整個的意大利民族，不但是整個的意大利民族，而且是全世界的人類。他最大的貢獻，就是指示了一條光明的人生之路給我們。他告訴我們應該去從平常所不注意的地方去尋求寶貴的美麗的詩。我們對於這些美麗的詩只要勇敢地去享受，去工作，去鑑賞，去思索，這些詩中就會滋生出一股偉大的力量，這力量會使你毫無痛楚地突破一切的障礙，像海濤，像在風，像閃電一般的前進！</p>
<p>有許多地方，我們除了感到著者思想的高超外，更不能不佩服他那作風的優美。據序文中說，著者原是一位意大利的詩人，這是很可徵信的；因爲全書的文字幾乎處處都是詩一般的輕鬆，美麗，雄壯。有幾處的描寫，絕非一般小說作家所寫得出來的。請看下面的幾段：</p>
<p>舅父的體格結實，雖不十分修長，肩膀平廣，髮全呈灰色，鬍鬚濃重，眉毛明晰，略一顰蹙，那長長的眉毛之下幾乎看不出眼睛來。</p>
<p>舅父的眼睛眞奇怪。睥睨怒潮似的光與柔和的光，無時不在交代了輝鑠着。</p>
<p>舅父心氣躁急，時常發怒，但雷霆一過，就此完結，以後很是和柔。</p>
<p>舅父的顏色曬得如赤銅般。面上刻着深溝也似的皺紋。一見似乎可怕。但仔細看去，在强的力中却充滿着慈祥，宛如一個年老的善良的獅子。　——第十頁——</p>
<p>小孩穿着無袖的白絨櫬衣從薄的紗布領間露出着春花一般的小頭和小肩。其氣象的淸漸純潔，宛如朝晨的陽空，幾乎使人想像得新時代的曙光。　——第七十四頁——</p>
<p>最後，我也像譯者夏丐尊先生一樣：「希望國內整千萬無福福升學的少年們能從這書獲得一種慰藉，發出一種勇敢的自信來！」</p>

<h3>絲茶滬絲經近期貨奇缺</h3>
<p>昨日橫濱絲市回軟、現貨跌十七元、期貨跌十四元、紐約近期漲半分、遠期跌一分、日華絲品持價續降二分、故海外絲價已不若前之挺秀矣、申埠絲市、未能遷就、且近期貨奇缺、成交寥寥、廠絲等則較有走銷、價頗平穩云、</p>
<h3>針眉綠茶略有走銷</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市、各歐莊行家、均因上星期國外來電預約定購之貨、已辦足額、如以星期六祗有半日市面、市況愈見寥落、全市僅祗協和錦隆等行、買進針眉秀眉珍眉等綠茶、共計二百餘箱</p>

<h3>統計　九月份桐油貿易狀況　歐美去路依然無甚進展　上海漢口市况同見寂靜</h3>
<p>據實業部上海商品檢騐局發表、月份上海桐油出口、計三·八三九公担、較去年同月之六·六一六担、减少二·七七七担、本年九個月总計七八·七九八担、較去年同期之一〇六·六二〇担、减少二七·八二二公担、又查本月漢口輸出數量、計二八·六二三公担、較去年同月增加七·七七九担、本年九個月總計三五三·四六〇担、較去年同期亦增加八九·八五六担、至本月上海內銷桐油之輸出計五四二担、較去年同月增加二八四担、本年九僩月總計一一·五四三担、較去年同期增加五·一〇七担、</p>
<p>本月份桐油市况、以出新漸近、賣買雙方均呈觀望、且存底尚豐、來源又相當踴躍、而歐美去路呆滯如故、故交易沉寂、市勢盤旋下趨、漢市洋莊雖時有交易、但無大宗成交、月初市盤徘徊於六十一二元、而後輒見下跌、至十九日竟跌入五十元關內、其後市况恍惚、陷於沉悶狀態之中、各洋行雖有現貨迆胃、無如開價過廉、行家大都不願脫售、以致現貨交易、幾乎停頓、</p>
<p>上海油價、因漢市頻跌、亦形軟化、各洋行意興索然、市氣靜寂、浙度油同受白桐油跌風影響、相繼貶抑、一般囤戶鑒於新油登塲漸近、讓價脫售、下旬初跌至四十八元、市勢紊亂、概可想見、</p>

<h3>兒童儲金與節約運動</h3>
<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>儲蓄，是一種很好的美德。現在我向諸位親愛的小弟弟，小妹妹，誠懇地報告一個好消息：在本報十月一日的那天，第四張十四版上面，有郵政儲金匯業局，兒童儲金的辦法，啊！小朋友們！你要儲金的話，在那裏說得很詳細，恕不贅述了。</p>
<p>你們是何等的幸運，吃的飯，穿的衣，都是由父兄供給的，是多麼舒適！是多麼快樂！喂！譬如，父親每日供給你的點心錢或糖菓錢，不是就有一角或二十枚銅元？如果，你們祗用掉十枚，每日給二十枚銅元的小朋友，那末，你就剩餘十枚，天天這樣，到了月底，就有一元錢，送到郵政儲金匯業局或銀行裏存起來，將來過了十年……二十年……三十年……就有一筆極大的款子了。</p>
<p>我們應該知道，點心錢，糖菓錢是那裏來的？是父兄的腦汁……血汗換來的，所以我們要節省下來，把零星的錢，集成整款，作爲應付天災，人禍，害病……和一切意外的事故，並且最近國府提倡節約救國，我們小朋友，也應該蜴力推行，節約就是新生活中簡單樸素的精神，儲蓄也是養成節約的最好方法，因爲旣然有餘款儲蓄，對於一切費用，當然就有節省的心理，希望存銀越多越好，將來才有更鉅大的款子小朋友！起來實行吧！我們是節約運動中的小實行家。啊！</p>
<h3>從蘇省小朋友獻劍說起</h3>
<p>— 士鵬</p>
<p>這次江蘇全省的小朋友，以本年爲蔣委員長五十壽辰，每人捐糖果資一枚，由各縣敎育局或學校，直接匯交敎育廳；約千餘元，鑄劍以獻蔣委員長之壽。敎育廳自收到各校繳欵，卽托上海華東運動器具公司鑄劍。該公司已將劍鑄成，其形式與普通指揮刀同；惟全係純銀造成，中間夾以金絲，上鐫「領袖羣倫」四字，異常壯觀。</p>
<p>從這回事實看起來，我們得着兩個敎訓：</p>
<p>一、蘇省的小朋友，他們愛國，救國情緒的熱烈，是値得我們佩服的。他們認爲欲救國，必須先要劃一全國同胞的信念，然後再由賢明的領袖，調整我們的步伐，使全國同胞，站在同一戰綫上，鞏固我們的國防。蔣委員長是我們全國唯一的領袖，誰也不能否認的。所以蘇省小朋友，積資鑄劍，特別表示崇功官勞之意。</p>
<p>二、從這决鑄劍捐欵，可以看得出小朋友們，每天每月每年所消費於糖果的金錢，爲數實屬至巨且大。我們何不一枚一枚地儲蓄起來呢？「聚沙成塔」，「積腋成裘」，一天一枚，一月便有三十枚，一年便有三百六十五枚了。假使全國小朋友都如此，這個數目是何等大呀！</p>
<p>小朋友！美國亞美利加幼童號的軍艦，値得你們羨慕的吧？我也希望我們中國，在不久的將來，有中華幼童號的軍艦逡巡海面，或者某省幼童號的飛機，翱翔天空。</p>
<p>這，我想你們大槪很樂意去做的吧？</p>
<h3>船的駛行</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>一天，敏兒的家裏收到了一封信，才知道他的伯父在廣州生了重病，家裏的人就很擔憂，尤其是他的祖母。伊老人家的愛子之心，是多麼的深刻呀！因此便呌敏兒的父親到廣州去探望他伯父一番。他老人家便在星期六上午獨自的去了。</p>
<p>不知不覺的過了兩個多星期，他的父親才從廣州回來，家裏的人當然是很快樂，因爲他們是盼望了好多天了。便詢問他的伯父現在可痊愈了一些，途中的情形怎樣？是不是風平浪靜？這樣的熱鬧了一下。</p>
<p>下一天，敏兒便開口問他的父親道：「爸爸，你是不是坐招商局的輪船去的？是不是打從海洋去的？」</p>
<p>「我在上海搭了招商局的輪船去的，出了吳淞口，風平浪靜，那時的景色，眞是和陸上的風景大不相同，尤其是在夕陽西下的時候，格外的美麗。後來經過了東海而到了香港，然後由香港到廣州。」</p>
<p>「束海一定是很大的吧，在這廣大無際的海面上，船上的駕駛員怎樣能認識這一條路是到廣州去的呢？」</p>
<p>「東海當然是很大的，再出去便是太平洋了。他們能在海面上認識出一條路來到廣州，他們的駕駛術一定是很精明。你不是坐過了小火輪的，當小火輪開駛的時候，不是有一個呌「老大」的在船頭上擋着一個舵輪來使這艘船左右轉灣嗎？大輪船上也一樣有一個人在舵輪旁把舵。不過在小火輪的「老大」可以隨着情形自由地轉動舵輪，而大輪船的把舵的人必須要聽船長的命令，不可以由自己來轉動，他祗得看前面的一個羅盤，羅盤就是指南針，保持船長所發出的羅盤的方向。輪船一出了港口，就由船長發出羅盤的方向——也可呌做羅盤針路。這羅盤針路是從一張極精細的海面上的地圖上得來的。這張海圖上所記載的是：水的深度，海底的性質，或是泥，或是沙石，山的高度，什麼地方有礁石，那兒有燈塔，都記載得淸淸楚楚，另外還有一張方向圖。船長便從這張海圖上，從出發地到目的地的中間，找尋出一條最安全最簡短的航綫。然後用平方尺推到方向圖上，量出它的方向。再加上了當時當地的風，潮流，船上的鐵質，和着地球磁極和南北極的差等等所發生的影響，於是他們從這羅盤針路，循着一定方向在海面上航行，但是人的智識和經騐到底是有限的，因此常有種種的錯誤。」</p>
<h3>早晚兩個好時間</h3>
<p>— 范顯微</p>
<p>一天之內，小朋友在學校裏，噹，噹，噹，下課，隨着時空一的一搭地過去，形式上，從早上九時起，打開書包，至下午四時止散學，就算一天的工作完了，其實那裏算得做完，僅僅敎室裏的工作，時間有限，何况還有不明瞭的地方，或者尚沒有印進小腦子裏呢？</p>
<p>現在上課用分數制，普通每節只卅分鐘，多也不過四十分，眼睛一霎，又是噹，噹，噹，下課了，說句老實話：上課的鐘點裏，幾樣主要科目，差不多完全是學生受灌輸—聽講的時間，像瓶子盛水一般，那水的漏掉和不漏掉，却全在你們自己去留意和保持！因爲溫習的機會，簡直絲毫沒有「囫圇呑棗」，怎能獲得到實際的好處？好比喫一樣美味小菜，若不在嘴裏咀嚼咀嚼，喉嚨一過，不是要「其味立失」嗎，所以小朋友除上課之外，都該加下一些自修工夫，才算是工作完了，獲得到眞實的學問！</p>
<p>什麼是最好的自修時間呢？「早上」和「晚間」，實在最爲適當，並且天天起早身，還可以增進身體的健康，早上精神和光綫好一點，宜寫作，演算等，（至少一小時）晚間電燈光下要損目力，宜讀書，做日記，做手工等，（也一小時）這樣如能一日不間斷，得益眞未可限量！因爲一天自修兩小時，每月就是六十小時，全年就是七百廿小時，好不偉大哪！</p>
<h3>餞行曲</h3>

<h3>兒童生活剪影</h3>
<p>— （柳攝）</p>
<p>小朋友！指甲要時常修剪　上學前先整理書包</p>
<h3>不服從命令的蛋</h3>
<p>— 子良</p>
<p>你拿一隻鷄蛋，把蛋的兩端各刺一孔，將蛋黃和蛋白倒出來，便用鐵粉和蠟混合起來集於一端，在火熖上供一會兒，使蛋內的蠟融化而將鐵粉凝固於一點，不能移動，這隻不服從命令的鷄蛋便做成功了。你要它睡，它偏偏要立了起來，你要它倒立，它偏偏要翻一個筋斗仍然正立起來。你如果把鷄蛋畫成人形，那便是一個很有趣的不倒翁了。你還可以拿這隻不倒翁在朋友面前當魔術玩。你可以對朋友們說：「大家看呀！這隻鷄蛋這樣的不服從命令，我要它睡，它偏偏不睡，待我來施個法術，使它服從我的命令。』</p>
<p>說着，你便拿起不倒翁來放在火上烘幾下，使蛋內的蠟融化。於是急速搖動鵝蛋，使蛋內的鐵粉和蠟不致凝固在蛋殼上。</p>
<p>這工作做了之後，你便可以對朋友說：「好了，好了，現在不倒翁服從我的命令了！大家看啦，我要它站，它就站；我要它睡，它就睡！」</p>
<p>如果你玩的時候，手法純熟，朋友們一定要驚奇不止。這也是應用物體的重心作用做的。小朋友，在家庭內何妨把這遊戲試試看！</p>

<p>菊花紫，禮義廉恥四個字，尚禮義，明廉恥，改善習慣成大器，努力發奮能作事，小朋友們須切記。</p>
<h3>妹妹的小發明</h3>
<p>— 嫻生</p>
<p>—怎樣洗去瓶內的汚痕</p>
<p>小朋友們，我來告訴你們一件實用的方法；就是怎樣洗淸瓶內的汚痕。這是我的一位小妹妹所新近發明的，伊不敢自秘，要我寫出來告訴諸位；我想發明雖不十分重要，却很合實用的，我就答應了伊，動筆把伊發明的經過和這方法寫出來。倘若你看了讚伊一聲聰明，那我這位小妹妹一定會感到快樂而對你張開伊的小嘴笑哩。</p>
<p>那是這樣的，這半年伊升入了高小一年級，學校裏規定要習寫英文字，那不是需要用藍墨水的嗎？到店舖裏去買藍墨水要八個銅板一瓶，而且是很小很小的一瓶，用不到多的時候就要完的，我的小妹妹是很懂得經濟的，伊去買了五個銅板的靛靑自己來溶，這樣可以溶一大瓶，足够一學期用，那不是很便宜的嗎？</p>
<p>但是靛靑溶了之後，却發覺沒有瓶子來裝，這使伊難住了，雖然像牛奶瓶，果子露瓶是得多的，不過這些瓶都不合用，不但蘸起墨水來不便，就是携帶也很累墜，而且拿到了學校裏不是要笑死人嗎！</p>
<p>後來伊終於在書廚底下找到一個我的用過了的墨水瓶來，這個瓶以前是放紅墨水的，所以裏面盡是紅色的痕跡。伊快樂得什麼似的，連忙用水來洗，可是因爲那紅色的痕跡年代得久了一點，竟象漆似的膠着，很不容易弄去，伊用一隻筷子緾上了一層布塞進瓶裏去擦，底上的一層痕給伊弄去了，但四週圍的一層痕却仍舊存在着，那是因爲瓶口小筷子擦不到。這又使伊苦惱了。伊想盡種種法子，總沒有用，在伊苦惱到極點的時候，不知怎樣在牆角的地上給伊發現一堆細砂，她靈機一動，想把這些砂放入瓶內，再放進一些水，然後用力把那瓶來搖，使砂子在裏面磨擦，那不是一定可以把裏面的汚痕磨去的嗎？伊就照樣的做了，果然，不到一刻工夫已把瓶洗得光光的了。</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們倘若在洗瓶的時候，碰到和我這位妹妹同樣困難，你就可照這方法做去，我可以包你會成功的；因爲我也試騐過好幾决了啊！</p>
<h3>飛魚的飛翔術</h3>
<p>— 董遜</p>
<p>飛魚是魚類中很奇特的一種魚，它在生物學上的學名呌做Cypse＇urus　agoo，又名文鰩魚，是一種屬於喉鰾類的海魚；熱帶和亞熱帶的海洋中，均有產之。這飛魚的身體長約有一尺半左右，和其他各種魚類最不同最特異的地方就是它的胸鰭生得特別長大。它的前端差不多及到尾鰭的基部，張開的時候好像一架單翼飛機的機翼，顏色是半透明的。尾鰭的上葉較大而下葉則較小些。至於它的腹鰭也幾乎位於臀鰭之前，分爲大小二種，腹鰭大的在飛翔時很像飛機的後翼，所以和胸鰭合在一起稱爲四翼型的飛魚；腹鰭小的只好稱爲二翼型的飛魚，這兩種可說是飛魚中主要的種類，因爲它們也和別的魚類，一樣地分爲許多種族的。</p>
<p>飛魚可稱是一種天然的滑翔家，它能以每秒五〇——七〇的速率飛離水面而翱翔於水面之上，它在飛行時候，一對胸鰭是很平穩的，並不像鳥類的翅膀，在飛行時候那麼的撲擊着空氣的。</p>
<p>有一位專門研究飛魚的生物學家卡爾赫白士先生——美國密西根大學動物學研究所中的一位研究員，他經過了多年的研究，說是飛魚的飛翔方法很別緻，在它們快將飛翔水面之時，它們摺攏了胸鰭直趨上水面（甲），胸鰭在露出水面時即行展開、魚體之前部即飛離水面（乙），尾鰭之下葉劃擊水面，產生飛離水面之動力，在一秒之內，它的尾鰭可以擊動五十次甚至七十次之多（丙）及至腹鰭展開時，魚體卽全部飛離水面（丁），兩對魚鰭（胸鰭及腹鰭），完全展開。（此指四翼形型的飛魚而言）（戊）飛魚的飛行時間極爲短促、僅祗半分鐘之久，但是有時候，它們把尾鰭浸入水中，便可以重行飛起，繼續飛行於水面之上。飛魚入水時的姿勢也很好看，它把胸鰭拚合了，打一個轉身趨入水中（己）</p>
<p>飛魚在飛行的時候，常打着快速度的回轉，就因爲太快的緣故，所以常會碰到別的魚身上，或者還會碰到船身上。有時候它們被高浪所擊。它們飛行的姿熊在遠處望去好像成了半圓形的弧綫，眞是好看得很！</p>
<p>海洋中有趣的生物很多，這飛魚不過是其中的一種呢！</p>
<h3>飛魚</h3>
<h3>孝（二）</h3>
<p>— 海</p>
<p>這一天來了；伊走到那謖謖有聲的松林中去，又祈禱着上天給伊勇氣向父親提出這個主張，而使伊父親好好的接受下來。但是祈禱也往往不能立刻有效的。伊的父親悄悄地聽伊說完了一番話就喚着他的夫人道：『噲！這裏來了一位女恩人哩！我們的女兒預備上彼得堡去，給我們向皇帝說情』。當下他就把他女兒的計劃說給他夫人聽。他的心突突地跳着，而他的聲音中含着一種開玩笑的意味。</p>
<p>他的夫人開口說道：「伊還是好好地去做伊的工作，不要說這一種沒意識的話了」。可憐的柏絲可菲聽了這話十分難受，禁不住抽抽咽咽的哭了起來，伊的母親授了一塊布給伊，柔聲說道：「親愛的，快去抹抹桌子，預備用晚餐，然後舒舒服服的上彼得堡去吧』。</p>
<p>這樣一天天的過去，柏絲可菲又提出伊的主張來，要求伊父親加以考慮、伊父親被伊緾繞得生起氣來；就很嚴厲的禁止伊再提這一回事。伊沒法可想，只得自己抑制着；但是一連三年，伊仍然天天祈禱實現伊的計劃。在這三年之間，伊的母親曾害了一場重病，病得很久，柏絲可菲一方面做着看護，一方面又須料理家事，得到伊的父母很大的信任，他們倆也不再當伊是一個小孩子了；到得伊重提舊事時，他們也不再笑伊，只苦苦的勸伊，不要拋下他們，因爲他們倆年老力衰，一天也少不了伊，而伊單身出門趕這長長的路程也是非常危險的，伊一言不發，只是撲簌簌地落淚，但伊對於這年深月久的大計劃，那裏拋撇得下呢。</p>
<p>可是伊要動身出去，非有護照不可，要是沒有護照，就得立刻被送回依吉村來。况且以前伊的父親也曾好幾次遞過呈子上去，全不理會，他倘再提什麼要求，也一樣是沒有用的。幸而柏絲可菲得到了一位同被放逐的官昌的帮助，替伊去請求一張護照，又等了六個月，回音來了，伊自己並沒有犯什麼罪，當然可以自由的離開西伯利亞，那護照也就送來了。伊的父親一見這護照就搶去鎖了起來，他說任伊怎樣的去請求，一定是沒有希望的，因此他不願意讓一個十八歲的女孩子孤另另地去趕這千辛萬苦的長路。</p>
<p>柏絲可菲仍然堅持着伊的主張，天天苦求伊的母親轉勸父親許伊出發，末後伊的父親拗不過伊，終於軟化了。他說：『我們將怎樣對付這個孩呢？伊旣一心一意的要去，那我們也只得讓伊去了』。於是他又向柏絲可菲說道：『可憐的孩子！你以爲上彼得堡去向皇帝說話，也像你在西伯利亞向你父親說話一樣的容易麼？他的皇宮中，每一個門口都有守兵緊緊地把守着，你再也不能跨進門口去。况且我們又窮苦得像乞食的一樣，你旣沒有好衣服穿，又沒有甚麼人給你介紹，你將怎樣去見皇帝？又有甚麼人肯領導你進宮去呢』？</p>

<h3>聯話</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>近數年來，我國長途電話事業，突飛猛進，據交部發表之統計，每歲擴展之綫路，率在一萬公里以上，於是東也開放營業，西也完成通話，通商大埠，重要城邑，推而至於內地市鎭，莫不有話可通，無言不達，國民使用電話之便利，誠日進無已。</p>
<p>考查交部所以發展電話如此之迅捷，乃採用分段建設之法，所謂分段建設，卽爲分工合作，故計畫旣定，工程隊卽分頭進行，在同一時期中，施工架設，因之京銅段成功不久，而銅鄭段亦告完成，京漢段亦隨而工竣，相互聯絡，於是沿綫各地，一通而無所不通，若然，則其建設也分段，結果仍屬一貫，彼此繫連，成爲聯話。</p>
<p>聯話之結果，可以增加人之交接，可以縮短地之距離，可以節省時之消耗，對於發展國內工商業，具重大之助力，此層當爲任何人所熟知。際今國難臨頭，外侮日亟，卽舍工商業而不談，則全國團結一致，整齊步伐，恊力對外實爲當前之急務。我國地大物博，譏之者恒謂如一盤散沙，補救之道，聯合爲先，而交通方面之建設，卽所以促進國內之聯合，京漢綫旣通，則京與漢間，不啻比隣，若更一轉接，則豫皖贛湘等省，亦如饗斯應，如此無形中將全國緊縮，土地密集，使人與人之交接更近，中央與地方間之聯絡更切，增進相互之關係，以充實團結之力量，斯固聯話中應有之意義。</p>
<p>各省之聯話旣通，各省之聯絡亦成，我人對斯話機，與任何省人士通話，覺彼此語音淸晰，歡洽無間，昔也關山修阻，通問爲難，今也談吐可聞，恍同晤對，苟幽然以遐想，確全國係一家，精誠可達，當不免時生親愛團結之感想。</p>
<h3>行政院積極整頓官電收費</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>核准救濟辦法三條　希望政軍機關長官注意</p>
<p>交通部爲整頓官軍電報收費起見，經呈奉行政院自本年七月一日起，切實辦理，並奉附發整頓官軍報辦法三項，印刷布告張貼，同時通飭各電報局，應遵照行政院令，嚴格奉行，嗣後對於官軍電報，一律照章收現，不得有任何通融辦法。</p>
<p>上項辦法實行以來，各機關照章付費者，佔大多數，惟尚有少數局，因經費困難，或限於預算，未能照辦，關於此點，交通部曾會同財政軍政兩部，擬具救濟辦法三條如左：</p>
<p>（一）各機關拍發電報，自二十五年七月一日起，應依照修正官軍電報收費及限制辦法，一律付給現欵，凡屬軍事委員會暨軍政部所轄各機關學校及部隊，如有未能遵辦者，廳由會部負責追繳，至其他各機關倘因二十五年度預算業已支配確定，而所列電費數目不敷支付者，應聲叙理由，專案報請各該主管機關查核，如查明屬實，得准其在該機關原預算各項目內，統籌支用，或另予設法，酌加經費，俾資抵補，而免拖欠。</p>
<p>（二）電政係國家重要事業，如不澈底整頓，其影響於政治軍事者甚鉅！而整理維持，在在需欵，倘各機關不嚴遵付欵辦法，不惟整頓無望，且有崩潰之虞！各機關務須照規定辦理，如再不照辦，電局得停止其發電。</p>
<p>（三）發電不得冗濫，非緊急情形，廳改用快郵，不得動輒發電，電文並須力求簡明，不得冗長。</p>
<p>上述三條辦法，已呈奉行政院核准轉呈國民政府，通飭直轄各機關遵照辦理並分別函令矣。吾人於感激政府苦心維持電政之餘，對於三條辦法，尚應加以闡明，希望政軍機關注意及之！</p>
<p>一·政軍機關應請維持電政　電政爲交通事業之一，關係於政治軍事者甚鉅。平時維持，端賴電費之收入，而根據統計，政軍機關所發之官軍電報，嘗佔每年電報字數百分之六十以上，苟此六十以上字數之官報費，不能全數收到，則所賴以維持電政者，僅百分之四十以下字數之商報費，電政經費，自然感覺不足。又查政軍機關每年所欠之官電報費，恒在三百萬元以上，此項鉅大欠項，若不設法補救，不惟電信建設無望，且有整個崩潰之虞！影響所及，不獨公衆通信，不能維持，且軍事交通，殆將斷絕！電局爲維持電政起見，對於不照章付費發電之機關，不得不遵奉行政院令停止其發電之權。</p>
<p>二·政軍機關應請照章付費　以前各機關，因預算關係，經費有限，對於所發電費數目，不能確定，一旦請其照章付費，自有種種困難。現在行政院旣頒此令，各機關因二十五年度預算業已支配確定，而所列電費數目不敷支付者，得聲叙理由，專案報請各該主管機關查核，准其在預算各項目內統籌支用，或另予設法，酌加經費。自此各機關預算範圍，旣經擴充，則電報經費，可云敷用，而所發電報，似應照章付費，以盡職責，不能藉口經費困難或預算不够等語，以資搪塞也。</p>
<p>三·政軍機關應請節省電費　政軍機關電費，旣有上述救濟辦法，固毫無問題，然欲維持預算，自應限制發電，蓋能限制發電，乃能節省電費，節省電費，始能維持預算也。限制發電之方法有二：（一）非緊急情形，不得發電；（二）電文力求短簡，不得冗長。前者减少發電次數，後者减少發電字數，次數字數减少，則電費自然節省矣。且也，節省不必要發電之費，則必要發電時，不致因預算不敷，而欠付電費。故斟酌損益之間，大有研究之餘地也。</p>
<p>上述三項，一方面闡明行政院核准三條辦法之結果，一方面陳述政軍機關維持電政之職責，維持電政，卽所以維持行政院之功令，與維持政軍機關本身之能力也。想賢明之政軍機關長官，决不河漢斯言</p>
<h3>長途電話通話種類槪述</h3>
<p>— 葆眞</p>
<p>最近修正之交通部國內長途電話營業通則，將自本年十二月一日起實行，新通則內規定之各種通話名稱，均已更改，與現行名稱不同列表對照如下：</p>
<p>原名　更改之名</p>
<p>普通通話　尋常呌號</p>
<p>加急通話　加急呌號</p>
<p>普通預告　尋常呌人</p>
<p>加急預告　加急呌人</p>
<p>普通傳呼　尋常傳呼</p>
<p>加急傳呼　加急傳呼</p>
<p>豫約通話　定時通話</p>
<p>新通則對於長途雷話通話，分爲下列三種：</p>
<p>一，呌號通話　發話人呌接某號某地電話，並未指定某某人前來接　者，稱爲呌號通話。例如，南京—二二四五零」。</p>
<p>二，呌入通話　發話人呌接某地某號電話，並指定某某人前來接話，或指定與合用電話之某一用戶，自用小交換機之某一分機，或商店機關等之某一部份通話者，稱爲呌人通話。例如「天津五一八四七莊永法」。上項通話，發話人除指定某甲爲受話人外，同時得另行指定某乙爲該受話人代表，或指定該受話人之另一電話號碼，以資替代。例如「天津五一八四七莊永法或程葆英」，「天津三二二三九或三二二四一馬國章」。</p>
<p>我國各地商店，住宅，學校，公寓，機關等所裝市內話機，平時往往由僕役接話後轉呌主人或其他負責人前往答話，因須轉呌不免稍費時間。如此辦理，在市內通話並無時間限制，尚無經濟上之損失。然於長途電話通話時，吾人如用呌號通話，照章自發話局接通某地某號電話後，由受話用戶與發話人開始通話之時起，卽須計時收費。故此項呌號通話，如由受話用戶之僕役接話後，再轉呌主人或其他負責人前來談話，其間若耗費一二分時間，連同談話時間如逾三分鐘者，卽須多納一次誥費，殊欠經費。惟呌人通話，照章係自受話人，或其代表。或指定之自用小交換機之某一分機，或指定之商店，機關之某一部份，與發話用戶通話之時起計時收費，不至因轉呌而耗費時間話費。故長途發話用戶，如已知對方之話機係公用性質，或向由僕役接話者，與其因轉呌而耗費時間話費，因不如採用呌人通話有敏捷而省費也。</p>
<p>三，傳呼通話　發話人呌接某地某人，而受話人並未裝有電話，須由受話電局派差傳呼受話人至電局，或指定就近之長途電話零售處，或公用電話處通話者，稱爲傳呼通話。例如「北平武衣庫十三號葉堯城」。上項通話，發話人除指定某甲爲受話人外，同時得指定其他一人爲該受話人之代表，俾受話人不在時，卽由其代表前往！代爲接洽。但此項受話人代表以與受話人同住一處者爲限。例如「北平武衣庫十三號葉堯城或盧文德」。</p>
<p>上述三種通話，均有尋常與加急之分。凡呌號呌人及傳呼三種通話，依照掛號次序通話者，均稱尋常通話。由發話人聲請，將其所發各種長途電話，提在共他各種尋常通話之前，接綫通話，或通知受話電局，提前派差傳呼受話人，至電話通話者，均稱爲加急通話。加急呌號加急呌人及尋常或加急傳呼通話之開放地點，係由交通部規定後，通飭各電局公告之。傳呼通話以受話人在電局營業區域以內者爲限，其未經規定營業區域者，以離局三公里爲限。又照現行長途電話營業通則之規定，傳呼通知須於話費外另加專力費，預告通知須於話費外另加一次通話費之三分之一。新通則實行後，上項呌人及傳呼電話均將同樣收費，並取銷專力費或加收之三分之一通話費。此項新規定，較之現行價目稍有出入，應請長途電話用戶特別注意者也。</p>
<p>新通則內除上述各種尋常及加急通話外，尚有下列三種特別通話：</p>
<p>一，特約通話　發話人如須按日與某處某人在指定之兩電話機間，在預約之一定時刻，作一定時間之通話者，稱爲特約通話。上項特約通話，對於各大商行報告商業行情，頗爲便利。惟其掛號期間，至少須一個月，通話費亦須由聲請人預先繳付。聲請人與電局並須盯立合同，以資信守。</p>
<p>二，定時通話　長途電話，經發話人於掛號時，在電局規定營業時間以內，預定通話時刻者，稱爲定時通話。惟此項定時通話，須於預定通話時刻前若干小時預先掛號，其時間由電局規定公布之。</p>
<p>以上兩項特約通話及定時通話，如屆預定通話時刻，適遇長途話綫已被佔用，應俟該項業已接通之電話通話完畢後，再行接通。</p>
<p>三，夜間通話　長途電話，於夜間規定之某時至某時內通話，其通話價目較日間通話價目低廉者，稱爲夜間通話。此項通話對於新聞記者話傳消息，殊爲便利消費。</p>
<p>以上三種及其他長途電話特別業務之通話地點，均由電政管理局按照事實需要及話綫繁簡情形呈請交通部核准辦理，其詳細辦法及價目，均另有規定。至關於使用長途電話之掛號手續，通話决序及計費收費辦法各節，不在本文題旨範圍以內，容再另文續談可也。</p>
<h3>關於補收住址費的解釋</h3>
<p>— 超鏖</p>
<p>一份用滿期掛號代替收報人姓名住址的來報，照章是停止投送的。交通部爲便利公衆起見，前經訂定通融辦法，遇有這種電報酌補住址費，仍予投送，這原是便利公衆的通融辦法。可是近來常常引起誤會，誤會的原因，不外下列幾點：（一）收報人有時手邊沒有錢，呌電局報差先把電報交付，回頭補付往址費，報差不肯，而收報人急於要看電報，遂引起誤會。（二）有時收報錢躭人取延過久，報差催促，因此引起誤會，現在讓我分別解釋如下：</p>
<p>關於第（一）項，電局原尊重收報人意思，在以前報差是照辦的。後來因爲發生了幾次糾紛，有幾位收報人，看過電報以後，不肯把住址費補付，也有把電報看過以後，推說電報不是他的而不肯補費，報差回來因爲電報已經拆過，就得將住址費賠繳，從此以後，報差不肯先把電報交付。可是這樣一來，因爲一二個人的不守信用，而帶累大部極有信用的收報人感覺不方便。爲補救這個缺憾起見，電局在在研究補救辦法，務使素有信用的公衆們，感到便利。不過最好希望有掛號的收報公衆，在掛號期滿以前，早點到電局續掛，免受補付往址費的損失。</p>
<p>關於第（二）項，電局對於報差投送電報，都有限回時刻，以免躭誤電報，遲延了就有處分，所以報差要是等候許久，就感到職務上的困難，這層希望收報公衆們原諒。</p>
<p>總之，誤會的發生，有時往往兩方都沒有錯，只是一些小小的隔膜，一經明白解釋，就煥然泳釋了！</p>
<h3>廣播節目與兒童教育</h3>
<p>— 徐韋立</p>
<p>—爲各位家長解决一個難題—</p>
<p>嘗閱滬某報載：「滬上廣播電台雖極發達，然所播送之節目，多屬迎合低級趣味者而發，其影響於兒童生活至鉅。一般故事，每涉神怪，甚至荒誕不經，非但不足以輔助兒童敎育，抑且有害兒童思想。故曾有多數家長特製木箱一隻，一至兒童放學而家時間，卽將收音機加鎖，用以禁止兒童收聽」云。</p>
<p>吾人對各位愛護兒童之家長，表示同情，亦可見今日中國家庭敎育進步，爲家長者對兒童敎育已予密切之注意。深願全國各廣播電台，能體會各位家長敎養之苦心，而在兒童放學時間，儘量播送有益於兒童之節目，以輔助兒童敎育也。</p>
<p>今有一可喜消息，可爲各位家長道者：卽交通部上海廣播電台所播送之各項節目，基於輔助社會敎育之不足，並提倡家庭中之正當娛樂起見，特闢兒童節目一項，由兒童敎育專家多人担任播送兒童故事等。用以增進兒童知識，學習國語，鍜鍊口才，於兒童放學時間收聽，對於兒童敎育必收事半功倍之效。面在兒童方面耳聽有趣之敎育故事，當不再作其他有害身心之娛樂。凡家有無綫電收音機者，請試聽週率一三〇〇，呼號XOHC，交通部上海廣播電台所播敎育節目，必能使諸君滿意也。</p>
<p>最近該台播送兒童節目時間，（每日下午六時半至七時）（星期停）特請前北平大學兒童敎育家胡英女士，講苦兒努力記」，略述一個苦兒，原爲貴族子嗣，被族叔奪產拋棄，後爲入收養，至十餘歲，隨一賣藝者，各處亂跑，終於偶然中遇其親母及親弟，其弟正患病甚劇，不幸又卽分散分散後苦兒仍過其流浪生活，經過許多困難危險，最後終又與親母和弟弟相聚，後來竟成爲一大偉人。情節曲折，描寫活潑，胡女士講來有聲有色，兒童收聽，必有興趣，幸各位賢明家長注意及之。</p>

<h3>Premier Chiang Kai-shek's Letter of Gratitude to Compatriots and Comrades Across the Nation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Premier Chiang Kai-shek recently issued a letter entitled "A Letter of Gratitude to Compatriots and Comrades Across the Nation for Raising Funds to Donate Aircraft." The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"I am deeply grateful to compatriots and comrades everywhere for initiating fundraising to purchase aircraft in commemoration of Zhongzheng's 50th birthday. I, Zhongzheng, am but a man growing older with little to show for it, with virtue and accomplishments yet to be cultivated. As I reflect on the passing years, I find myself barely able to make up for past shortcomings, how dare I presume to receive such favor and increase my feelings of guilt? However, the purchase of aircraft is a donation to the nation, not merely a commonplace gift. Moreover, this undertaking has drawn enthusiastic participation from overseas Chinese in Europe, America, and Southeast Asia, as well as from cities in border regions and the heartland. Men and women, young and old, have eagerly contributed, either from their savings on food and clothing or from the entirety of their diligent labor, all of which has been pooled into a large sum to purchase aircraft, which are then donated to the government to strengthen national defense. This is all inspired by the patriotic spirit of our compatriots and is indeed an unprecedented feat in recent years.</p>
<p>As a member of the government, Zhongzheng, upon witnessing such righteousness and courage, can only feel grateful and motivated to work hard for the country. However, I dare not accept this commemoration for myself. Zhongzheng has committed himself to the revolution and has long since ceased to care for his own well-being. Having received this encouragement, I will only strive to improve myself, exert all my efforts to lead the way, and fulfill my duty to consolidate the nation and revitalize the race.</p>
<p>Moreover, I hope that the officers and soldiers of our air force will be inspired by the enthusiasm for this fundraising and will universally understand the people's fervent expectations for our air force. They should strive to improve themselves, be even more diligent and cautious, and live up to the national compatriots' accumulation of donations for the sake of national defense, thereby laying the foundation for the nation's independence and freedom. If the entire nation is united in heart and mind and vigorously strives forward, then the history of the nation will surely be passed down for countless generations. I respectfully express my sincere feelings, and I hope that my compatriots and comrades will take note." (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Opening Address by Chairman of the Assembly Wu Tiecheng</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The opening address delivered by Wu Tiecheng, Chairman of the Aircraft Donation Assembly, is as follows:</p>
<p>"Today, on the occasion of Mr. Chiang's 50th birthday, representatives from all over the country and hundreds of thousands of citizens in the capital are holding this grand and enthusiastic aircraft donation ceremony. We are all greatly honored to be a part of this event.</p>
<p>Mr. Chiang has followed the late Premier, dedicated himself to the revolution for decades, and his contributions to the Party and the country are known to the world and need not be detailed here. Suffice it to say that in the ten years since the Northern Expedition in 1926, he has been engaged in arduous struggles such as suppressing warlords, eradicating communist bandits, completing unification, and supporting the nation in times of crisis. He has done what others could not do, endured what ordinary people could not endure, borne hardships without complaint, and persevered despite countless setbacks. Surrounded by internal and external troubles, he has finally laid the foundation for the revival of the Chinese nation today.</p>
<p>Now, on his 50th birthday, compatriots across the country are offering aircraft as a birthday gift, presenting this extraordinary gift to express their extraordinary respect. This is truly an unprecedented event. Under the leadership of Premier Chiang, the Chairman of the National Government, we are determined to revive our nation, reform our country's customs, and build a solid foundation for our country. He is undoubtedly the leader who is sincerely supported by our compatriots across the country. We must express our highest respect for this leader, and naturally, we must appreciate his painstaking efforts and assist in his work. Therefore, compatriots across the country, regardless of whether they are in the interior or border regions, at home or abroad, have unanimously contributed funds to realize his goal of strengthening national defense.</p>
<p>We believe that Mr. Chiang cherishes the country and is the cornerstone of China. By celebrating his birthday in this way, we are also working together for the country. 'Saving the country through aviation' was the late Premier's legacy. With his prescient vision, the late Premier instructed us more than a decade ago that the path to saving the country must involve the development of aviation. 'Future wars will be determined by the strength of the air force' has also become a universally recognized principle among military experts today. Although China's aviation industry has been catching up rapidly in recent years, it is still in its infancy. This aircraft donation for birthday congratulations is a great record in the history of Chinese aviation and is truly worthy of our utmost respect and satisfaction.</p>
<p>In short, this donation of aircraft for birthday congratulations clearly demonstrates that compatriots across the country recognize the leader, have a deep faith in him, and practically support him. Compatriots across the country have transformed their passionate feelings for saving the country into practical work. Compatriots across the country have turned their verbal advocacy for aviation construction into their own responsibility. At the same time, we know that China's aviation industry is still in its infancy and that China's revitalization work is currently laying the groundwork. The great cause of saving the nation and saving humanity, which compatriots across the country are striving to accomplish under the guidance of the leader, will surely flourish in the future. In today's grand ceremony, in addition to expressing our deepest respect and admiration, we are willing to continue our efforts and encourage each other to implement the Premier's policy of saving the country through aviation."

<h3>Original Text of Chairman Lin's Speech at the Aircraft Donation Birthday Celebration Ceremony</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The original text of Chairman Lin's speech at the aircraft donation ceremony is as follows:</p>
<p>"Fellow compatriots, today, government officials and the people are gathered here to hold the aircraft donation and acceptance ceremony for Comrade Chiang's 50th birthday. I am greatly honored to participate in this grand event. Comrade Chiang has made great achievements and is only fifty years old this year. He has already completed the great task of national revolution and unifying China in military affairs, implemented the New Life Movement in civil administration, and striven for new construction. The national spirit, which has been weak and listless for hundreds of years, has been revitalized, laying a solid foundation for the country and opening up a path to survival for the nation. Therefore, compatriots across the country feel that Comrade Chiang is respectable and lovable and have come to appreciate the value of Comrade Chiang's birthday. Hence, there is this grand gesture of birthday congratulations and aircraft donation. This expression of long-term goodwill and the comfort of popular sentiment are of utmost glory and contain incredible power, all of which stem from Comrade Chiang's spirit of serving the country and the people and are truly admirable.</p>
<p>I am very pleased to participate in today's grand event and see the enthusiastic emotions of the masses. There are a few words that I should say to my fellow compatriots. First, aircraft are a powerful weapon of national defense. Your birthday congratulations and aircraft donation are meant to increase the strength of national defense, not to expand the weapons of aggression. Because the Chinese national character has always been very peaceful and only seeks to strengthen national defense, there is absolutely no foreign ambition. Furthermore, according to the teachings of our Founding Father Sun Yat-sen, we also advocate peaceful struggle to save China, which is to teach us to strive diligently, based on the peaceful national character, to save the country. Now that the country is in a difficult situation, everyone needs to rise up and work together to achieve the goal of saving the country peacefully. Comrade Chiang follows the late Premier's teachings, leads the people, and saves the country together, that is, he is striving to fight based on the principle of peace.</p>
<p>Second, my fellow compatriots do not offer wine, food, or other items for Comrade Chiang's 50th birthday, but rather offer aircraft. This shows that the significance of this celebration is by no means comparable to ordinary birthday celebrations. It commemorates Comrade Chiang's glorious past achievements, comforts Comrade Chiang's glorious experience of enduring countless hardships, and at the same time, it places the future heavy responsibility of saving the country and saving the people on Comrade Chiang's shoulders, increasing the government's reliance on its meritorious officials, and expressing the people's sincerity in trusting the government and supporting the meritorious officials.</p>
<p>Third, although the aircraft that government officials, civil organizations, and groups donate to Comrade Chiang for transfer to the government today may not be enough for a hundred, the accumulation of funds for purchasing aircraft is due to the enthusiastic donations of everyone and can be said to be of one mind. Therefore, these many aircraft are no different from the crystallization of the blood of tens of millions of people, fully expressing the sincerity of the people's close cooperation with the government. Its price and its power can not only defend the country but also expand to become the core of peace and stability in East Asia.</p>
<p>The above is just a general overview of my personal feelings. Today, Comrade Chiang has gone to the Northwest on official business and is not in the capital. Comrade He Yingqin, who represents Comrade Chiang in receiving and donating the aircraft, is also a loyal and patriotic military and political minister who has followed Comrade Chiang through hundreds of battles and made great achievements. The other officials and people in the field are also colleagues who have helped Comrade Chiang through difficult struggles over the years. The government is extremely moved and delighted to accept this. It is hoped that everyone will follow the spirit of Comrade Chiang in saving the country and saving the people, be upright in mind and sincere in will, follow Comrade Chiang's leadership, and continue to move forward. I take this opportunity to wish the Party and the country a long life, Comrade Chiang longevity, and all the officials and people who have raised funds to purchase aircraft and participated in the ceremony good health and good fortune. The end." (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>

<h3>Chairman Lin Awards Premier Chiang the Honorary Certificate</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government's Chairman Lin awarded Premier Chiang the following honorary certificate:</p>
<p>"Auspicious times are opening, and a wise man of the world is born. It is a public service to the country and not the things of the distant lands. Chiang Chung-cheng, the Premier of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the Military Council, celebrated his 50th birthday on October 31st of this year. Various sectors of the nation donated aircraft and sent their congratulations. With a humble heart, he dedicated it to the country. The President of the National Government, on behalf of the National Government, praised him and awarded him a certificate. To wish him a peaceful and long life. Flying across the sky, national defense is more strengthened. May the country be as impregnable as gold, may the mountains and rivers be as great as his achievements. May his meritorious service be passed down for generations. May his honor be glorious. Hereby, Lin Sen, the President of the National Government, October 31st." (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Birthday Airplane: President Chiang Transfers it to the Nation</h3>

<p>(Nanjing) The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance invited representatives from the Ministries of Interior and Industry to hold a meeting on the 31st to discuss grain transportation and sales. Gao Bingfang presided over the meeting. First, representatives from each ministry reported on the handling of grain transportation and sales and the situation of local treasuries. The Ministry of Industry also provided a written opinion on the grain transportation and sales issue for reference. Then, they discussed measures for conducting grain surveys, statistics on grain transportation and sales, and prohibiting exports to the north. The results of the discussion were as follows: (1) The production and storage quantities in various places should be reported to the competent departments at any time and investigated at any time for statistics. (2) Each competent department should also exchange materials and opinions on the handling situation at any time to facilitate adjustments, price stabilization, and unified transportation and sales. (3) Regarding measures to prohibit exports, it was decided to hand them over to the Customs Administration to formulate measures to facilitate overall handling. It was also agreed to hold a meeting once a week to discuss and improve measures at any time. Also, regarding the number of rural warehouses operated by local governments and the number of agricultural loan warehouses operated by various banks, due to the lack of detailed reports from most, it is still difficult to compile statistics. The Ministry of Finance will order them to report within days. Regarding the measures prohibiting rice from leaving the provinces, it is considered to be limited to a part and also conflicts with domestic adjustments. After the Customs Administration formulates measures to prohibit exports to the north, the prohibition order will be revoked. It is also heard that whether it is necessary to establish a unified presiding organization has not been discussed. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Huludao Port to Unofficially Open Today</h3>

The port construction project is being carried out by the South Manchuria Railway. After the opening of the port tomorrow, all matters will be managed by the newly established Railway Bureau. All railways in Manchuria and northern Korea are managed by the bureau. It is heard that the port will become the shipping center in the Jinzhou-Rehe area, and it is scheduled to officially open in February next year. On the 12th of this month, the Railway Bureau announced a five-year plan to expand various facilities of the port. This project will begin next year. Upon completion, the port will be able to handle the loading and unloading of 2 million tons of cargo per year, while it is currently limited to only 60,000 tons. It is widely believed that Huludao will occupy an important position in western Manchuria trade, especially in commerce with North China, the Kwantung Leased Territory, and Japan. The Fushun coal mine is nearby. Zhang Zuolin originally planned to develop the port and had already started construction by a Dutch company, but it was eventually suspended due to the September 18th Incident.

<h3>Protest Against the Japanese Military Exercises in Pingjin</h3>
<p>By Hua</p>
<p>While Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places are celebrating President Chiang's birthday with great enthusiasm, in North China, which also belongs to our national sovereignty, the Japanese military is conducting large-scale exercises. Homes are being occupied, residents are being evicted, and panic is at its peak. The difference between these two situations is what we cannot ignore at present. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 30th, the government, because the Japanese military's actions violate treaties and international law and undermine our national sovereignty, has sent a note to the Japanese embassy to protest. This is as it should be. Now, let us analyze the illegality and unreasonableness of the Japanese military's exercises in North China from diplomatic and political perspectives to arouse the attention of the entire nation.</p>
<p>In recent years, neighboring countries have frequently infringed upon our national sovereignty, especially in military actions. The violation of North China's airspace, the intrusion into the Shanghai city area, and the reconnaissance of coastal fortresses and ports have all been protested by our government, but to no avail. Since the beginning of this summer, when Japan greatly increased its troops in North China, the construction of barracks, the opening of airfields, and even the conduct of military exercises in bustling cities have completely violated the restrictions of the Boxer Protocol, and the safety of our people is not guaranteed. However, the Japanese military exercises in Pingjin are the largest in scale ever. According to the Central News Agency, the total number of participating troops is over 7,000, and the area covers the Pingjin-Tongfeng area. It started on the 26th of last month and has not stopped as of today. Such violations of our national sovereignty and disturbances to our people should be stopped by our country with the most resolute steps.</p>
<p>Let us examine Japan's own position. When the United States conducts military exercises in the Eastern Pacific, its scope only extends to the Midway Islands. Japan believes that it is threatened and maintains the most serious attention. When the Soviet Union concentrates a large army of 300,000 on the Far Eastern border to prevent foreign invasion, Japan also believes that it is threatened and demands its withdrawal. In fact, these American and Soviet troops are only conducting exercises and deployments within their own territory, but Japan believes that they contain a threatening nature. Then, what basis is there for 7,000 troops to conduct large-scale exercises in our territory, even targeting Beiping as an attack objective? This undoubtedly violates our territorial sovereignty and threatens our national defense and the safety of our people.</p>
<p>Moreover, Sino-Japanese diplomatic negotiations have reached the sixth round. It is said that there are no concrete results and it is still a stalemate. We do not know whether these threatening exercises are intended to further exacerbate the stalemate or to use this concrete threat to forcefully break the stalemate and achieve diplomatic progress.</p>
<p>In short, from this large-scale Japanese military exercise, we can imagine that the crisis in North China is now expanding and deepening. This matter is indeed worthy of great attention.</p>
<h3>Keelung Incident; Anglo-Japanese Friction Deepens; Britain Dissatisfied with Amau Doctrine; Believes it Contains Provocative Nature</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The British Embassy in Japan expressed great surprise at the "unnecessary and provocative" statement made yesterday by the spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Amau. According to the statement, which was based on the Keelung accident, Amau made the statement even though he knew that the Japanese high authorities had ordered a continuation of the investigation into the matter. Therefore, it is believed to contain a "provocative" intent. This matter is actually under trial. The British side strongly opposed the statement made by the spokesman that "after the British submarine left Keelung, a British naval flag was found floating on the surface of the water in the port, from which it can be inferred what the condition of the British ship was when it was moored here." As for the spokesman's claim that the extended visit of the commander of the British fleet in China, Lieutenant General Little, was entirely a matter for Britain itself, the British side also expressed its disagreement. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) People here believe that the treatment of three British sailors on the British ship "Medway" by Japanese police in Keelung, Taiwan, was "extremely brutal." The claim made by the Japanese that the British sailors did not pay the fare has been solemnly denied. The commander-in-chief of the British Navy in Asia, Lieutenant General Little, has investigated the matter in detail and can fully prove that the sailors did pay the fare and that a naval officer was present and witnessed it. According to the investigation, when the three sailors were taken to the police station by the Japanese, they were not intoxicated at all. Unexpectedly, after being released, all three were beaten and suffered injuries all over their bodies. One of them even had his jaw broken. The British authorities believe that if the sailors had disturbed order and were drunk, it would not be surprising that the Japanese police intervened, as it was their duty to do so. However, the British Navy believes that the sailors have strict discipline and will not cause disturbances when visiting foreign territorial waters. At present, what the British side intends to protest is the Japanese police's extremely abusive treatment of the three sailors. In July last year, the British protested to Tokyo because an Indian merchant was detained in Changchun and suffered harsh treatment. He was later released after it was found that he had no criminal suspicion. As for the Chinese employees of British commercial firms in Manchuria who were abused by the Japanese police, there are countless cases. Among them, one person died due to serious injuries. This time, the British protested to Japan over the Keelung incident, aiming to demand that the Japanese side provide appropriate compensation to the injured sailors. The British government hopes that Japan can do so in order to end this unfortunate incident. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a Domei News Agency dispatch from Taiwan, the local authorities have conducted a detailed investigation into the case of the three British sailors being abused by Japanese police in Keelung. All the facts reported by the British side are groundless. This investigation was carried out by the police station after the British consul in Taiwan lodged a protest. According to the Domei News Agency, the Japanese investigation found that the three British sailors hired a car from a certain place to Keelung late at night on October 7th. Unexpectedly, after getting off the car, the three immediately entered a cafe and did not pay the fare. Therefore, the driver reported to the nearby police. The Japanese police ordered the British sailors to go to the police station for questioning. At that time, a British naval officer was willing to testify. However, because the officer's testimony was completely inconsistent with the facts provided by the three sailors, the officer was also taken to the police station. However, all four were released at dawn. The investigation found that the sailors had not been subjected to any abuse. The British side's sudden protest over this incident shows that the British side may have other intentions and is taking this case as an excuse. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Important Meeting of Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Discuss Issues with Russia</h3>

<h3>After the Iraqi Coup; Military Dictatorship Established; Sidqi is the Leading Figure; Former Prime Minister Flees, Army Chief Executed</h3>
<p>Jerusalem After a bloodless coup in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, yesterday, the country has effectively established a military dictatorship. The figure behind the scenes is General Sidqi, the most ambitious and powerful military leader in Iraq. However, his name is not on the new cabinet list. Well-informed sources believe that the coup in Iraq was caused by disagreements over the implementation of conscription for nomadic tribes. Sidqi wanted to quell the rebellion of the Shia tribes in the Euphrates River basin, and he requested the deployment of troops and prepared reinforcements with combat capabilities for use. Therefore, he advocated the implementation of conscription. However, the government led by General Yasin intended to adopt a more moderate attitude and did not approve Sidqi's proposal. Thus, the coup followed. It is generally expected that the new cabinet organized by Salaiman will implement a universal conscription system. However, the tribes are extremely opposed to conscription, which may cause unrest. Sidqi also advocates the use of brutal methods. It is believed that if the unrest develops, the world will shift its attention to the Arab National Union movement in Palestine. On the other hand, if the Iraqi tribes do rebel, the Middle East may fall into turmoil. After the new cabinet of Salaiman took office, it expressed its willingness to maintain the original friendship with Britain. According to Baghdad sources, the cabinet of General Yasin was fortunate to resign, otherwise the Iraqi army might have come to the capital and dissolved it by force, and a bloody tragedy would have been difficult to avoid. At that time, Iraqi troops were concentrated in Guila Khan, 70 miles northeast of Baghdad. At that time, many army planes dropped many leaflets over Baghdad, all signed by Sidqi, demanding that Yasin's cabinet resign quickly, and claiming that there were many cabinet members who harmed the public for their own benefit. Therefore, the army must expel them. Subsequently, the planes dropped four bombs as a warning, resulting in one person seriously injured and dozens slightly injured. Seeing this situation, Yasin's cabinet immediately announced its resignation. The new Prime Minister Salaiman issued a notice today, instructing the people to live and work in peace and not to be alarmed. Yesterday, shops in the city were closed, but the local situation was still peaceful. It is expected that the big day will return to normal. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Cairo It is heard that General Yafar, a powerful figure in Iraqi politics, was shot dead in Baghdad today. The general was the former Minister of Defense in the cabinet and a major enemy of the new government. He had been hiding since the violent coup took place. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Baghdad According to official announcements, former Prime Minister General Yasin and resigned cabinet members Aalit and Said have left Iraq for the benefit of the people. It is believed that the three are heading to Syria. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Damascus Former Prime Minister of Iraq, General Yasin, left the country for Beirut and arrived here today. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) A coup occurred in the Kingdom of Iraq yesterday, and the cabinet organized by General Yasin was forced to resign. According to news from the British Embassy in Iraq, the coup was not of a military nature. After the Yasin cabinet was forced by its political enemies to resign, King Ghazi Faisal appointed Sulaiman to organize a new cabinet of seven members. Sulaiman served as Prime Minister and Minister of Interior. The political crisis was thus resolved. According to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, Britain had already recognized Iraq as an independent country and was not obligated to maintain domestic security in Iraq. However, if the events develop to the point where they affect British interests in Iraq, two brigades of British troops stationed in Cairo, Egypt, and one brigade of troops stationed in Palestine are ready to move to prevent any eventuality.

<h3>U.S. Presidential Election: Unemployment Problem Important; Roosevelt to Propose Amending the Constitution, Stipulating Maximum Working Hours and Minimum Wages</h3>
<p>(New York) President Roosevelt has so far revealed little about his platform for re-election. However, it is widely expected that Roosevelt will issue a surprising statement in response to his political opponent, Republican presidential candidate Landon's, accusations regarding the National Recovery Administration. The Democratic Party members are deeply aware that the repeated announcements by the Republicans that there are still 11 million unemployed people nationwide are having a significant impact. Therefore, it is anticipated that President Roosevelt will continue to formulate plans to encourage employment. To that end, he may amend the Constitution to establish maximum working hours and minimum wages on a national scale. Yesterday, on Wall Street, someone bet $9,000 against $5,000 that President Roosevelt would be re-elected. Judging from the number of registered voters nationwide, the number of voters who can vote is about 5 million more than in 1932, with a total of 45 million. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>Brooklyn President Roosevelt delivered a speech at the Brooklyn Academy of Music today, attacking the enemies of the Social Security Act, calling it a crucial undertaking that the American people will praise on November 3rd. The Social Security Act is a new charter to protect American workers, supported by enlightened employers, church leaders, philanthropists, and educators. Even 67 Republican members of the House of Representatives have expressed sympathy, with only 18 opposing. In the Senate, 15 Republican senators support the bill, with only 5 opposing. Is it not puzzling that you now deny your Senators and Representatives? It is now heard that unscrupulous employers are using money to buy off workers and exert pressure, which is tantamount to exploiting workers' blood and sweat and is not to be taken as a model. Regarding the water and drought relief work relief agencies, officials claim that these agencies not only relieve famine and unemployment but also restore hope. (National Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>(New York) There is much speculation here today as to whether President Roosevelt will deliver an exciting declaration regarding the National Recovery Administration in his final minute of the election campaign. Former President Hoover stated in a speech in Denver that he had rejected many of the plans proposed by President Roosevelt during his term because they would delay the nation's recovery. Former National Recovery Administration Director General Johnson stated in a speech in Waukesha, Wisconsin, that he expected President Roosevelt to win a great victory. It is still doubtful whether Republican candidate Landon will win the votes of six states. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<h3>Britain Advocates Control of Armaments, Opposes Nationalization</h3>
<p>(London) The Arms Manufacturing Investigation Committee submitted a report today, stating that the most effective way to eliminate obstacles to the elimination of private arms manufacturing is to conclude international agreements to limit armaments. It is absolutely impossible to establish a universal national patent system, and it is requested that Britain not consider it as part of its national policy. Methods for regulating and controlling armaments domestically should be promoted quickly. The various proposals recently put forward by the United States in the League of Nations regarding armaments can serve as the basis for concluding international agreements. The various recommendations of the committee are listed below: (1) The government should bear full responsibility for the arms industry; (2) Establish government manufacturing plants to supply the equipment for the navy and air force; (3) Limit the profits of various arms merchants in peacetime, and forcibly impose them during wartime; (4) Arms exports should have more active licensing methods; (5) Stop the practice of issuing public and ordinary passports; and (6) Prohibit private exports of surplus and old armaments.

<h3>Central Europe and the Near East Set New Record for Cooperation; Talks Between Romania and Czechoslovakia End, to Engage with Yugoslavia; Yugoslav Prime Minister Leaves Turkish Capital</h3>
<p>Yugoslav Capital, Belgrade Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović went to the Turkish capital the other day to conduct talks with the Turkish authorities. At the same time, King Carol of Romania also went to the Czech capital to meet with President Beneš. Political figures here believe that the new era of cooperation between countries in Central Europe and the Near East will begin with these two talks. If Italy can provide assistance, then this cooperation will not be difficult to fully realize. Furthermore, Italy's relations with Yugoslavia have recently improved greatly. Once the Rome Revised Agreement is signed between Italy, Austria, and Hungary in November, after the Vienna academic conference, Italy may propose a comprehensive solution to various issues in Central Europe, which may also include Germany. However, political figures also believe that in future negotiations, all trends aimed at enabling certain major powers to dominate Central Europe should be rejected. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<p>Czech Capital, Prague King Carol II of Romania held talks with President Beneš today, issuing a communiqué stating that the two heads of state jointly pointed out the need to strengthen the unity of the Little Entente countries. All events arising from the current political situation should be based on the need for unity among the Little Entente countries to determine the course of action. Romania and Czechoslovakia will also hold talks with the Yugoslav government in the shortest possible time to achieve the above-mentioned goals. After holding talks today, King Carol and Crown Prince Michael left by car at midnight for President Zietolajevič's palace to hold a hunt. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<p>Turkish Capital The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Yugoslavia, Stojadinović, came here the other day to celebrate Turkey's National Day and to conduct talks with the Turkish government authorities. He has already started his return journey. A communiqué was issued here stating that Turkey and Yugoslavia share the same interests and hold completely consistent views within the scope of the Balkan Entente. They should now further develop mutual trade and cultural relations. In addition to the signed commercial agreement, universities in both countries should establish lectureships, hold lectures, and send students to study each other's languages ​​and scripts. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<p>Turkish Capital Among the three countries of the Little Entente, Romania has already reconciled with the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia has also established a mutual assistance treaty with it. Only Yugoslavia has not yet recognized the Soviet government. It is widely rumored here that the Turkish government is now working hard to urge the country to formally recognize the Soviet government in the short term. (Havas, 31st)</p>

<h3>This Country's Fascists, Relationship with Germany, Newspaper Reveals, Leader Denies</h3>
<p>Belgian Capital A local afternoon newspaper previously reported that the leader of the Fascist Rexist Party, Degrelle, secretly went to Germany on the 27th of last month and held a long conversation with German Minister of Propaganda Goebbels, who gave him much encouragement. After this news was published, Degrelle denied it. The afternoon newspaper has now published another article, attacking him again, saying that Degrelle's party members have received German funding, and all money transfers are done personally. Although it is not easy to obtain evidence in the accounts, there is no doubt about it. It is also said that Goebbels was indeed in Berlin on September 27th and received Degrelle at the Anti-Comintern headquarters. The so-called "Anti-Comintern headquarters" is the only organization of its kind in Europe, and its nature is equivalent to the international Fascist Party headquarters. These facts will soon be investigated in Degrelle's archives to know the whole truth. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<p>Belgian Capital The Fascist Rexist Party had originally scheduled to hold six gatherings this Sunday, but leader Degrelle temporarily announced their cancellation. (Havas, 31st)</p>

A total of forty-one people were killed and one hundred and thirty were injured in this battle, and several of them may not survive. In addition, when several National Army planes bombed the village of Getafe (the location of the airfield) 15 kilometers south of the capital, a woman holding a baby in her arms and carrying three other children was playing in the village. A bomb flew over, and the woman lost her head immediately, and the other three children also died. Only the baby in her arms was safe and sound, which is also a miracle. A total of twenty people were killed in this battle, and many were injured, several of whom were already on the verge of death. (Havas, 31st)</p>

<h3>Spanish Government Army Progress; Tank Force Unleashes Great Power; Sea Passage No Longer Dangerous</h3>
<p>Madrid Since the Government Army counterattacked on the 19th of this month south of the capital, its right-wing forces have advanced six kilometers, and its left-wing forces have advanced fifteen kilometers. Yesterday, it also consolidated the defenses of the regained areas, and at the same time completely surrounded the towns of Torrijos and Villa de Asko. The rebels in the town have now retreated into the church bell tower, resisting stubbornly. The railway traffic from Madrid to Aranjuez City in the south has also been restored, and armored vehicles can run freely. The Government Army is now concentrating its forces to attack Navalcarnero, southwest, which has been under Government Army artillery fire since dawn this morning. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<p>Madrid Regarding the battle in which the Government Army tank force recaptured the village of Seseña south of the capital yesterday, an eyewitness recently recounted the incident to a reporter from this agency as follows: It is said that when the tanks entered the village, they were not resisted. They were arranged in a line in the center of the village and began to bombard the rebel positions, destroying the rebel artillery. Then they continued to advance towards Esquivias, destroying five rebel artillery pieces, and then returned to the village of Seseña, while destroying the rebel barracks. The rebels were therefore greatly panicked. At that time, a heroic act was discovered. A tank, due to carelessness, suddenly fell into a trench. After seeing this, the Moroccan soldiers belonging to the rebels immediately surrounded it. Seeing that the army was already in danger, the other tanks immediately drove back to rescue them, and finally repelled the rebels, and the vehicle moved forward again after getting out of danger. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<p>Madrid The authorities announced today that as a result of the government army's counterattack, the rebels have retreated, and the railway from the capital to Valencia will soon resume ordinary passenger trains, and there is no danger at any station along the way. (National Telegram, 30th)</p>

He made great achievements in the war with Japan and Russia in 1919 and the war with Poland in 1920.

<h3>Soviet Russia Denies Italy and Germany's Accusations, Submits Reply to the Committee</h3>
<p>(London) Italy and Germany recently submitted notes to the Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee for the Spanish Civil War, accusing the Soviet government of violating the non-intervention agreement by supplying the Madrid government with arms. The Soviet Union has now submitted two notes to answer separately. The Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee has also scheduled a meeting for next Wednesday (November 4) to review the Soviet government's notes. It is said that the content of the notes strives to deny the accusations made by Italy and Germany, and said that the goods transported by the Soviet Union to Spain are only food, fuel, and freight trucks, which were originally not on the embargo list. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Blum told reporters from the Associated Press today that the time when the Spanish civil war would escalate into a European war has clearly passed. Blum did not say a word about the Soviet Union's declaration to resume its transport of arms to the Spanish government, but only said that he believed that all European countries wanted to stop the Spanish civil war or any political and economic conflicts from developing into a European war that could destroy culture. As for the danger of the Spanish civil war being spared from escalation, it should be attributed to the cooperation between France and Britain. All countries are now uniformly abiding by the non-intervention agreement, but the Soviet Union has some complaints. Blum also said that he is now working hard to get the French people to recover from the two world wars. As for France's foreign policy, it will continue to abide by various treaties and maintain friendship with various countries. It will maintain friendship with the Little Entente. During his tenure, there will be no action to isolate Germany, nor will he want to conclude secret alliances. Regarding relations with Germany, he can only reiterate his previous statement, that is, France is willing to participate in any talks that help solve European problems. (National Telegram, 31st)</p>
<h3>Amidst the War, a Knight Rescues More Than 50 Women and Children</h3>
<p>(London) The modern "Scarlet Pimpernel" (the English knight of the French Revolution) is said to have been captured by the communists in Malaga, 65 miles northeast of Gibraltar. This man is of English nationality, named Grace Hutchison. During this Spanish civil war, he rescued at least 50 women and children from danger. His most famous achievement was stealing the 8-ton yacht "Bee" from Malaga and transporting many prisoners to Gibraltar. It is reported that the method used by Grace at that time was to go ashore in the dark, drive to the nearest prison, deliberately talk loudly with the guards, and secretly enable the prisoners in the prison to take the opportunity to escape to the yacht he had prepared and take the risk. It is heard that Grace has been a lawyer in Malaga for nearly ten years before the revolution, and many of his close friends are inclined to the National Army. When the National Army bombed Malaga, many of these sympathizers with the National Army were killed. Seeing this, Grace could not bear it, so he used his methods to contact the local authorities and tried to obtain a visa to allow many of his friends to travel to Gibraltar. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<h3>U.S. Seamen's Strike Spreads; Pickets Appear on the Pacific Coast; Atlantic Workers Advocate Responding</h3>
<p>(San Francisco) Shipping along the Pacific coast came to a standstill today due to the general seamen's strike. The General Federation of Labor has ordered the organization of pickets. There are now 500 pickets in this area, with 12 pickets stationed at each wharf. The General Federation of Labor also warned 40 ships anchored in the port here not to set sail without authorization. It is heard that pickets have appeared in Seattle, Portland, San Pedro, San Diego, and other ports. The police have sent more than 180 special police officers to the coast to maintain law and order, and there are seven police cars on standby, each carrying two police officers armed with pistols and tear gas. Labor Minister McLafferty still hopes today that employers and union representatives can hold reconciliation meetings. This negotiation was suspended yesterday due to the strike. The union has also organized a strike committee and is willing to consider any possible mediation. Shipowners declared that they do not want to operate ships or load and unload goods, nor do they want to try to break the strike, so serious disturbances are expected not to occur. 800 dockworkers in this area and Oakland have joined the strike, resulting in the closure of warehouses and cold storage facilities. In addition, the labor unrest is spreading further today. Seamen in Astoria, Oregon, voted today to carry out a sympathy strike. Seamen in New Orleans are waiting for official reports from the Pacific coast to determine their actions. The situation on the Atlantic coast in New York is also becoming dangerous today. According to a Seamen's Union official, sailors on American ships in the port will strike. The issue of a sympathy strike by New York seamen is scheduled to be voted on tonight. (National Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>(New York) The Seamen's Protection Committee recently unanimously decided to strike for 24 hours to express disagreement with the striking seamen in San Francisco and to urge the International Seamen's Union to announce a general strike of all seamen along the Atlantic coast. The International Committee Union is scheduled to meet here tonight to decide. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>(New York) At a meeting of the Seamen's Protection Committee today, a vote resulted in a unanimous request for a general strike of seamen on the Atlantic coast to express sympathy for the strikers on the Pacific coast. This vote aims to force the executive committee of the International Seamen's Federation to intervene. The executive committee is scheduled to meet tonight. The labor unrest on the Pacific coast is spreading, and more than 150 ships are idle. The strike committee is now demanding that all ships in the port of New York that are scheduled to set sail within 24 hours go on strike. If the strike continues, at least 20,000 port workers on the west coast will be unemployed. (Reuters, 31st)</p>

<h3>The Trend of the Situation in Shanxi Province: A Renewed Vigor Emerges After the Implementation of the New Policies; Strict Prevention of Traitors and Protest Against Japanese Aircraft Flights</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Shanxi Province, located in the northwest, is hampered by difficult transportation. In the past, in the domestic political situation, whether in terms of military, political, or economic culture, it did not occupy an important position. However, recently, with the national crisis becoming severe and North China in danger, and as a certain power is sharpening its weapons to invade the extreme west, the situation in Shanxi Province has not only formed the forefront of national defense in the northwest but has also become the center of gravity of the political situation in North China. Therefore, what is the recent situation and what is the trend in Shanxi Province? It is worth paying close attention to. Therefore, a brief record of its situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Vigorously Implementing New Policies</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Republic of China, all major powers in Shanxi Province, except for the political part where the governors appointed by the central government were in charge for several years in the early Republic, from the fourth and fifth years of the Republic, Yan Xishan served as both military governor and governor, forming a consistent political situation. In the nineteenth year of the Republic, Yan briefly left Shanxi. In the winter of the twentieth year of the Republic, Yan returned from Dalian, and the central government gave him the position of Director of Pacification of Taiyuan, in charge of Shanxi and Suiyuan provinces. Therefore, all facilities in Shanxi Province are still under Yan's responsibility. However, in the political history of Yan, Zhao Daiwen has always been his most powerful assistant. For more than twenty years, without interruption day and night, he personally consulted on everything, big or small, because they shared the same goals and had a very good relationship. This summer, the Chairman of Shanxi Province, Xu Yongchang, resigned, and Zhao was ordered by the central government to succeed him. After taking office, he and Yan jointly urged military and political personnel to work hard together. Among the most laborious and effective measures taken by the authorities in recent Shanxi politics are the following: (1) Civil servants implement morning exercises; (2) Civil servants uniformly change to short clothes; (3) Training all levels of civil servants, county magistrates, personnel in charge of public justice groups in each county, directors of education bureaus in each county, principals of higher primary schools in each county, and high school students in each county. Recently, village chiefs and merchants from all counties in the province will also be trained; (4) Implementing a ban on opium and gambling; (5) Ordering all agencies and schools to hold flag-raising and flag-lowering ceremonies every day; (6) Strictly preventing the activities of traitors; (7) Rectifying social customs, such as female waitresses in restaurants and female barbershops; (8) Severely punishing corrupt officials and implementing the crime of dereliction of duty stipulated by Yan and approved by the central government. The above items are roughly the major points of the new policy, and because of the morning exercises and the change to short clothes, a renewed vigor has emerged from top to bottom. Civil servants at all levels and most of the masses have followed suit, and have all worn short clothes of brown or gray.</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibiting Opium and Gambling</p>
<p>In the midst of vigorously implementing the new policies, Shanxi Province also strictly prohibits opium and gambling. At the beginning of Zhao's tenure, he ordered the chief of the Public Security Bureau, Wei Gengshu Rong, to summon the managers of major hotels and restaurants to be responsible for making guarantees. Thereafter, these hotels and restaurants must never allow gambling, prostitution, or opium smoking to occur. Violators will be punished with the death penalty. With this one order, everything was immediately clarified. As for the opium situation in Shanxi Province, it was indeed eradicated between the third and fourth years of the Republic. Even opium smokers were listed by Yan as one of the three evils in the six major policies between the seventh and eighth years of the Republic, and were strictly prohibited. The ban was carried out vigorously and thoroughly. At that time, every tael of opium soil rose to more than twenty yuan, and it was still impossible to buy. The remaining few opium smokers, feeling the strictness of the law, did not dare to try. Moreover, because of the exorbitant price, where would they find such a huge sum to provide for daily consumption? Therefore, without official prohibition, they had already begun to prohibit themselves. Since the tenth year of the Republic, the authorities have been busy with military affairs, and have adopted a fine method for opium prohibition. As a result, a big gap was invisibly leaked. Although the opium ban has not been completely eliminated, gold pills of various colors such as blue, red, yellow, and gray have been smuggled in from the north from Tianjin and Shijiazhuang, and from the south from Zhengzhou and Luoyang, continuously and secretly. The people of Shanxi initially thought they were opium cessation medicines and took them together. The authorities also did not pay close attention and strictly ban them. After opium smokers had used it for a long time, they became addicted and spread it, spreading wider and wider. Before the opium disaster could be eliminated, the pill poison spread everywhere. Following in the footsteps of the gold pill, there were also the most potent drugs such as noodle flour. According to recent official statistics, the loss suffered by the people of Shanxi from the poison disaster in the past ten years, tangible and intangible, has reached more than 100 million yuan. Shanxi Province has been impoverished and financially exhausted in recent years, and its vitality has been damaged, almost beyond redemption. The cause is here. In the 20th year of the Republic, the provincial government was reorganized, and Xu Yongchang took charge of Shanxi, hating the severity of the pill poison. Therefore, the provincial government specially established a committee to investigate and ban drugs, appointing provincial committee member Ma Jun as the director, formulating separate regulations, and submitting them to the central government for implementation. Anyone in Shanxi who was found to be trafficking in and selling gold pills and noodle flour, regardless of the amount, was executed by shooting. Addicts were also sentenced to fixed-term or indefinite imprisonment. For several years, the number of drug offenders executed by shooting throughout the province has reached nearly a thousand. Since the association vigorously investigated and banned it, the disaster of pill flour began to diminish. At the beginning of the official ban on drugs, after various studies, in order to make it easier to achieve results, the Provincial Government Opium Prohibition Assessment Office officially produced opium cessation medicinal cakes as substitutes. Most of the raw materials for the medicinal cakes were opium soil, and they were divided into three types, A, B, and C, according to the high content. Each piece weighed one tael and was affixed with a stamp. They were distributed to licensed merchants for sale. The authorities originally intended to use this to replace the pill flour and quickly eliminate the drug disaster. Most of the opium soil was transported to Suiyuan and Shaanxi provinces. Now that the authorities' plan to ban drugs has been completed, they have decided to implement an opium prohibition policy in accordance with the central government's opium prohibition regulations. They have abolished the old drug investigation and prohibition committees and opium prohibition assessment offices, and have established the Shanxi Opium Prohibition Supervision Office, with Yan as the supervisor, Zhao as the co-supervisor, and Ma Jun and others as assistant supervisors. It has been formally established and has begun to work, intending to complete the opium ban. The office has now formulated a general outline for the implementation of opium and drug prohibition and measures for assisting the public justice groups in the counties and villages, and announced their implementation.</p>
<p>Preventing Traitors</p>
<p>Recently, rumors have been rife, and traitors in various places have turned restless, especially in the provincial capital and the Datong area of northern Shanxi. In order to strictly prevent this, Shanxi Province has also listed the prevention of traitors as one of the recent important policies. Regulations have been formulated and announced for implementation, ordering military police and public justice groups in each county to be prepared, allowing the people to report and receive rewards in accordance with the regulations. If they dare to falsely accuse, they will be punished for framing. The law is similar to this year's measures to prevent the reporting of communist bandits.</p>
<p>Related to the prevention of traitors is the establishment of special agencies by the Japanese in Taiyuan. Previously, during the period when Shanxi Province strongly advocated anti-communism last winter, the Japanese sent personnel to Taiyuan to negotiate with the authorities and, under the pretext of investigating bandit activities, requested to establish special agencies in Taiyuan and station personnel in Taiyuan on a regular basis. At that time, the authorities, believing that it was only for investigative purposes, only allowed one or two researchers to be stationed. Since then, the Japanese have sent military officers and built buildings in Xincheng Street and other places, secretly posing as special agencies. Subsequently, the number of Japanese coming and going became more frequent, every week on the first and fourth, and there were regular Japanese aircraft coming. A month ago, after the authorities raised objections, the Japanese side agreed to no longer send aircraft to Taiyuan. As for the special agencies, since Hezhi was transferred to Jinan, all activities seem to have temporarily become quiet. As for Datong, because it is adjacent to the Ping-Sui Railway and is located in the key area of the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan, the situation is more complicated than in Taiyuan. As for the issue of traitors, because Taiyuan is located deep inland, with difficult transportation, and with orderly order, and most of the people are good, there is little room for activities. Moreover, the authorities have listed it as an important policy and strictly prevent it. Judging from the recent situation, there seems to be no cause for deep concern. In addition, the military, police, and gendarmerie agencies in Taiyuan City have added posts on the streets in recent days, and are strictly prepared, hoping to prevent problems before they occur.</p>
<h3>A Major Fire on Baiyun Road in Guangzhou: Over a Hundred Shops and Households Destroyed; Over a Thousand Disaster-stricken Refugees</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the beginning of autumn, fire alarms in Guangzhou have occurred almost every day. A few days ago, fires broke out successively in Xinshengsha in the east of the customs, the Eight Banners Road on the South Bank, Huaxieshan in Henan, and Longdaowei Street, destroying hundreds of shops and households, causing heavy losses to the citizens. Residents have been busy with the aftermath, and the fires have continued to occur in recent days. At 2:00 AM on the 26th, a fire broke out in the Changsheng Paper Shop at No. 1, Section South, Thirteen Streets in Xiguan, spreading to the neighboring Guangxing Cotton Shop at No. 2, the vacant shop at No. 3, the Yongchang Shop at No. 4, and the Yongchang Warehouse at No. 5, destroying a total of five shops and causing tens of thousands of yuan in losses. At 2:00 PM on the 26th, a fire broke out in a household in Changan Street near the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Station on the East Bund Baiyun Road, destroying more than 120 shops and households, causing a loss of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, resulting in an unprecedented major disaster. It was found that someone in a residence on Changan New Street near the road was careless in cooking, and in a short time it had become a prairie fire, and the surrounding streets and alleys were turned into ashes. A large number of rails, sleepers, and a passenger car No. 71 on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway track and the workers' residences at Chuanlongkou were destroyed. The railway bureau suffered a loss of 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. The express train from Hong Kong to Guangzhou could not pass that afternoon, and had to unload goods near the Dongshan Stadium, and passengers had to change trains here before they could reach Dashatou. As for the shops and residences in the Changan New Street area, more than 120 were destroyed, and more than a thousand refugees were displaced. It was found that the residents of this area had moved here from Zengcheng County in the 18th year of the Republic of China. At that time, due to infighting among clansmen, the weak were forced to move to the provincial capital to live together, but unexpectedly, they were again hit by a fire robbery. It is truly a double disaster. Now, more than a thousand refugees have suddenly lost their homes and have to support their families under the ruins with thatched sheds to protect themselves from the wind and rain, or they huddle in the rubble piles, hungry and cold, in a terrible state. Charitable halls in the city have been sending people to distribute porridge and dry food to relieve the starving refugees. In the disaster area, there were more than ten streets in total, and more than 110 shops were burned down. A female body was found in the cremated area, and no less than 30 people were injured while escaping the fire. After being treated by the rescue team, they were left behind. A list of the burned shops on each street is as follows: Sili Sheng Vegetable Shop at No. 1 Baiyun Road, Shengji Shop at No. 3, Shengchang Shop at No. 5, vacant shops at No. 7, No. 9, No. 19, and No. 13, Cheng Sheng Shop at No. 11, Gongchang Shop at No. 21, vacant houses at No. 23 and No. 25, Sanjiang Shop at No. 29, Dongxing Shop at No. 1 Changan New Street, Changji at No. 2, Hou Residence at No. 3, Manchang Shop at No. 4, Wu Residence at No. 5, Gongzhan at No. 6, Wu Residence at No. 7, Hequn Factory at No. 8, Zhou Residence at No. 9, Lin Residence at No. 10, Zheng Residence at No. 11, Li He's Residence at No. 12, vacant houses at No. 13, No. 15, and No. 20, Chen Residence at No. 14, Meng Residence at No. 16, Zhang Residence at No. 18, Li Residence at No. 22, and two other residences without house numbers, vacant house at No. 1 Changan Street, Wu Residence at No. 3, Li Residence at No. 5, Liang Residence at No. 7, Liang Residence at No. 9, Faxing Shop at No. 2, vacant houses at No. 4 and No. 6, Liang Residence at No. 8, Huang Residence at No. 10, Liang Residence at No. 12, Yang Residence at No. 14, Lai Residence at No. 18, He Residence at No. 25, Zhang Residence at No. 22, Liang Gengji at No. 2 Linan Street, Helong Shop at No. 4, vacant shop at No. 15, Xingbali Shop at No. 17, Caiji Shop at No. 19, Xincheng Shop at No. 111, Lianan Shop at No. 23, Xingfaxiang Shop at No. 25, Huangxiang Shop at No. 117, vacant house at No. 29, Yuandong Shop at No. 1 Linan South Street, Xie Residence at No. 3, Huang Residence at No. 5, Li Residence at No. 7, vacant house at No. 9, Lin Residence at No. 11, Mo Residence at No. 13, Wang Residence at No. 15, Lin Residence at No. 1 Luheng Street, vacant house at No. 2, He Residence at No. 3, Zhong Residence at No. 5, vacant house at No. 6, Shen Residence at No. 7, vacant house at No. 8 Luheng Lane, Lin Residence at No. 9, Li Residence at No. 1 Luheng First Lane, Liu Residence at No. 3, vacant house at No. 4, Wen Residence at No. 5, Cai Residence at No. 7, Li Residence at No. 1 Luheng Second Lane, Yang Residence at No. 2, Ding Residence at No. 3, Lu Residence at No. 4, Tao Residence at No. 1 Yongan North Street Fourth Lane, He Residence at No. 2, vacant house at No. 3, He Residence at No. 5, Liu Residence at No. 7, Li Residence at No. 8, vacant house at No. 11, Huang Residence at No. 12, Tao Residence at No. 15, Luo Residence at No. 2 Yonggui Li, Qiu Residence at No. 4, Deng Residence at No. 6, Li Residence at No. 8, and seven workers' residences near Dashatou Station on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway.

<h3>The Route of the Guangzhou-Shantou Railway Is Determined: Starting from Zhangmutou on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, Along the Coast Through Lufeng and Jieyang to Shantou</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Guangzhou-Shantou Railway was stipulated in the three-year plan during Chen Jitang's administration, and Long Sihe was appointed as the preparation member. The original route was planned to start from Xicun, bypass the suburbs of Guangzhou, and go through Zengcheng, Huiyang, Zijin, Wuhua, Meixian, Fengshun, and then to Chaoan and Shantou. This route would have to cross the Dongjiang Bridge in Huizhou, and would have to pass through numerous mountain tunnels in Zijin and Fengshun. It would take more than four or five years and more than 40 million construction fees to complete. Therefore, since Long Sihe's preparation, there has been no achievement. Last month, Railway Minister Zhang Jiaxue went south and decided to extend the Huangpu branch line, starting from Xicun, arc-shaped around the suburbs of Guangzhou, crossing the Shipi section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway with an arch bridge, and going directly to the Yuzhu Fort. Then the Guangzhou-Shantou route would no longer need to start from Xicun. The Ministry of Railways believes that Shantou is the only commercial port connecting to various ports in Nanyang, and the Guangzhou-Shantou Railway needs to be started urgently and completed within two years. Therefore, Liang Yonghuai, the director of the engineering department of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bureau, was specially appointed as the preparation director. The new route has been decided, starting from Zhangmutou on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, following the route of the first trunk line of the provincial road, through Pingshan, Sanduozhu, entering Haifeng, Lufeng, Huilai, Puning, Jieyang, Chaoan, and then to Shantou. This route can save one hundred miles of engineering compared to the original route, and has highway assistance, without huge bridge and tunnel projects, making construction easy. According to this plan, it can be completed within two years. Liang Yonghuai has transferred to various sections of the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan Road to inspect the emerging projects. He will return next month to plan construction.</p>

<h3>Kunshan: Exemption of Rent for Land Occupied by Highways</h3>

<h3>A Grand Celebration of Chiang's Birthday</h3>

<h3>Wuxi: Resolution of Disputes at the Vegetable Market</h3>
<p>The Wuxi County Construction Bureau, with the approval of the Construction Department in the spring of this year, reclaimed and demolished ten original municipal buildings at the Jixiang Bridge. These were rebuilt into a two-story cement vegetable market, a large project which has now been completed. The bureau requested the Construction Department to send commissioners to inspect and accept the project. At the same time, the County Property Department stipulated monthly rents of two yuan per square meter downstairs, with a deposit of twenty yuan, and monthly rents of one yuan and five jiao per square meter upstairs, with a deposit of fifteen yuan. Merchants were invited to register and sign leases. However, the First District Office, considering the management of the vegetable market to be a district administrative matter, intended to invite merchants to lease through the district and allow vendors from the original Second Vegetable Market on Wanqian Road to move in freely, charging each household a registration fee of one yuan, without requiring them to sign leases or pay rent. This led to a major dispute over the management of the vegetable market. Subsequently, the County Property Department argued that the vegetable market rent had originally been collected by the Municipal Property Management Committee. Since the committee was abolished the year before last, the county had transferred it to the County Property Department for management. Other donations were collected uniformly by the Local Donation Collection Office. The district's unwarranted interference was seen as undermining the entire municipal property, and a special telegram was sent to the Finance Department for instructions. Now, the county government has received an order from the Finance Department instructing that the vegetable market rent should be managed by the Property Department, and the district office should not seize it arbitrarily. Yesterday, the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau was instructed to notify all vendors to register with the Property Department and officially sign leases and pay rent starting today (the 1st).</p>

However, the county government had previously notified the Rice Industry Association to inform its members of these regulations, but the date of commencement had not been specified. As a result, various firms had not registered in accordance with the law and lacked the necessary food export licenses. The Rice Industry Association telegraphed Wang Xianqiang, the Administrative Inspector of the Jiaxing District and concurrently County Magistrate, yesterday, requesting forgiveness and rectification. They also requested a clear deadline for completing the registration of grain merchants and obtaining licenses under these regulations. The association is currently compiling and checking grain store registrations.</p>

<h3>Hard Court Tennis Tournament Begins Yesterday: Wang Shuzi Loses to Korasa, Yan Jingmei Eliminated in Group Stage</h3>
<p>The 24th French Concession General Association Autumn Hard Court Tennis Championship kicked off yesterday. All twelve matches on the first day were men's and women's singles. Among the Chinese players in the men's singles, six attended yesterday. Except for Chen Yi and Sun Qifang, who repeatedly withdrew indoors to practice, only one had to be eliminated. The rest were only Zhu Shuzi, who lost to Korasa, Li Pijiu, Li Guofan, Sun Qifang, and Zhou Guanjun. In addition, the group results, except for Zhou Guanjun's victory over Dickson, which was slightly close in the first set, the rest became one-sided. The most regrettable thing is that Miss Yan Jingjiang, the only Chinese player in the women's competition, unfortunately lost miserably to Miss Mato, so the future battle for dominance will all be blue-eyed. As for the men's singles, because Carson left Japan and Bao Huadefu gave up, the prediction for the championship should be a battle between Li Pizu, a strong player from Beijing, and Korasa, a Portuguese general from the French Concession. Except for Zhou Shesuan, who unexpectedly defeated Ke in the second and third weeks, Li Pizu will meet Shi Yayu in the semi-finals, and Li Ke's entry into the final week will also be an undisputed fact. The results of yesterday's competition are as follows:</p>

<h3>Industry and Commerce Passed the Tenth Day Yesterday: Lively Market, Reduced Interbank Lending, and Money Shops Have Repaid Their Loans One After Another</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the tenth day period for Shanghai industry and commerce. All industries passed it safely due to sufficient preparation. Although the Central, China, and Communications Banks continued to handle interbank lending as usual, the lending was reduced due to the lively market, and the money shops have repaid their loans one after another. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Easy Credit</p>
<p>The Central, China, and Communications Banks, in order to regulate interbank finance, jointly organized a lending committee to handle lending matters for various banks and shops. All banks and shops can apply to the committee for lending with deeds, goods, and bonds as collateral. This year's tenth day was very lively because of the bumper harvest of agricultural products and increased purchasing power. Therefore, the credit in Shanghai was easy, and the applications for lending from the Central, China, and Communications Banks from various banks and shops decreased. For example, the foreign exchange rate in the money market was still 8% in both the morning and afternoon sessions yesterday, which shows that credit was easy.</p>
<p>Safely Passed the Tenth Day</p>
<p>All industries had made considerable preparations for this year's tenth day. At the same time, the Shanghai-Ningbo money shops provided accommodation for long-term credit loans that were due, so there was no emergency situation in the market yesterday, which was very different from the tenth days in previous years. The interest rate for new long-term credit loans made by various money shops is only between 8 and 10 yuan for those with good credit. The procedures for extending the term to the fourth day of next year have been fully completed, and all industries have safely passed the difficult hurdle of the tenth day.</p>
<p>Loans Repaid</p>
<p>Of the 18 million yuan that various money shops borrowed from the lending committee of the Central, China, and Communications Banks during the Dragon Boat Festival last year, after the borrowing money shops repaid in succession, only the loans borrowed by the Henglai and Hengxing shops, which are responsible for collecting accounts, have not been repaid. Now the two shops have taken measures to collect the loans they have made in order to repay the loans to the banks. However, these loans all have reliable collateral, so the three banks have repeatedly allowed the two shops to extend the repayment period. Because it is regulating interbank finance, the interest rate is 8% per annum.</p>
<h3>Suma Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday: Discusses Japan's Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Suma, First Secretary of the Japanese Embassy in China and Consul General in Beijing, returned to Japan on October 22 under the order of Ambassador Kawagoe to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Ambassador Kawagoe's negotiations with Foreign Minister Zhang on adjusting Sino-Japanese issues and to request instructions on future policies. He has completed his work and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 9:30 on the French mail ship Aramis. Takahashi, the representative of the Japanese delegation, welcomed him at the port. After disembarking, he went to the Japanese Consulate to rest. Then he met with Japanese diplomatic officials in Shanghai. He took the express train to Beijing at 1:25 p.m. to visit Ambassador Kawagoe and report back. A reporter from the Central News Agency met Suma on the ship. According to the interview,</p>
<p>No Concessions in Negotiations with China</p>
<p>According to Suma, I returned to Japan under the order of Ambassador Kawagoe to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and to request instructions. Because of the short time, I only stayed in Tokyo for two days. Japan's diplomatic policy toward China, whether in the government or among the people, still adheres to the original position and will not make concessions. Therefore, I did not bring the so-called new instructions this time.</p>
<p>Answers to Reporters' Questions: Says There is a Way</p>
<p>Suma continued, it is difficult to predict whether the Sino-Japanese negotiations can be resolved peacefully. However, according to my observation, the Sino-Japanese negotiations will not break down, and there is a way to resolve them peacefully. When the reporter asked how it could not break down if Japan's diplomatic policy toward China still adhered to the original position and would not make concessions, Suma smiled and replied that there was a way to not break down. As for Japan's views on the so-called "special status of North China" and "joint anti-communism," Suma did not make a clear statement.</p>
<p>No Statement on Credit Loans</p>
<p>Suma also did not make a clear statement on the Tokyo telegram that the Japanese government and people, in order to promote trade with China, would use the United Kingdom as a model and provide short-term credit loans to China. He only indicated that he had not heard of it when he was in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Arrived in Beijing in the Afternoon to Visit Kawagoe</p>
<p>After Suma disembarked, he returned to the consulate to rest. Then he met with Navy Attaché Sato, Councilor Wakasugi, and Intelligence Minister Yoshioka of the embassy. At 1:25 p.m., he left Shanghai with Secretary Wakasugi, Yoshioka, and Sone on the express train to Beijing to visit Ambassador Kawagoe and report back. The date of the seventh meeting between Kawagoe and our Foreign Minister Zhang will be determined after Suma arrives in Beijing.</p>

Full Sino-US air service is also expected to officially launch within this month. A detailed report from a Shenzhou News Agency reporter is as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong Station to Open on the 5th of This Month</p>
<p>Yesterday, a CNAC representative officially announced that the establishment of a CNAC station in Hong Kong has been successfully negotiated between China and the UK. The British government's operating license has been obtained by CNAC. Preparations for the station's facilities are actively underway. The official opening date is set for November 5th. The flight will depart from Shanghai at 6:30 AM and arrive in Hong Kong at 2:45 PM the same day. The northbound flight is scheduled to depart from Hong Kong at 7:30 AM on the 6th and arrive in Shanghai at 3:45 PM the same day. Initially, there will be three round-trip flights per week. Current bookings for the inaugural Hong Kong-Shanghai flights are extremely enthusiastic. Flight frequency will be increased as needed to meet demand. The one-way ticket price between Shanghai and Hong Kong is 200 yuan, and a round-trip ticket is 390 yuan.</p>
<p>Simultaneous Commencement of Service Between China and the UK</p>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation is handling the Hong Kong station opening on the Chinese side, while British Overseas Airways Corporation is handling it on the British side. Therefore, after the Hong Kong station opens on the 5th, the CNAC Shanghai-Guangdong route and the BOAC Far East route will also officially connect on the same day. From then on, passengers and mail between China and the UK can reach London via the joint CNAC-BOAC route. The spatial transportation between these two major Eastern and Western nations can thus be mutually connected, greatly facilitating travel and marking a new era for aviation in the Far East.</p>
<p>Full Sino-US Air Service Also to Be Established</p>
<p>With the CNAC Hong Kong station established, full Sino-US air service will also commence in the shortest possible time. Both Mr. Qu Libo, General Manager of Pan American Airways, and Mr. Witner, Chairman of the Board, have completed a test flight of the full Sino-US route and are currently conducting inspections in China. The date of the full Sino-US air service launch will be announced after Mr. Qu and Mr. Witner return to the United States and make a decision. Mr. Qu has already transited through London on his way back to the United States from Hong Kong. Mr. and Mrs. Witner and American media mogul Mr. Howard also took a CNAC flight from Shanghai to Guangzhou and then Hong Kong yesterday morning to catch a ship to Manila and then a Sino-US flight back to the United States. Once the Sino-US route is launched in the very near future, the three major trunk routes in the Far East—China-UK, China-France, and China-US—will all be completed.</p>
<p>New Aircraft to Be Deployed to China to Meet Demand</p>
<p>After the CNAC Shanghai-Guangdong route and Hong Kong station open, passenger and mail traffic are expected to be very heavy. Therefore, the company has already ordered two large Sikorsky flying boats from the United States, each capable of carrying approximately sixteen passengers. The internal equipment is also extremely complete. They are expected to arrive in China around the end of this year and will then be deployed on the Shanghai-Guangdong route and flight frequency will be increased. In addition, DC-3 Douglas jumbo landplanes will also continue to be delivered to China for deployment.</p>

<h3>Execution of Li Guojie Case; Order to Provide Assets Within Half a Month; Li Has Petitioned the Executive Yuan for Exemption; Plaintiff Requests Bankruptcy Proceedings</h3>
<p>Li Guojie, the former general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC), mortgaged four warehouses to the China General Edison Company without authorization and entered into a charter agreement with the Dalae Steamship Company, thereby harming national sovereignty. In order to establish the contract, Li bribed Chen Fumu, the director of the CMSNC, with a commission of 700,000 taels of silver. Zhu Jiajhua, the former Minister of Transportation, investigated and prosecuted the case. The Supreme Court ultimately sentenced Li Guojie to eight months of imprisonment with a two-year suspended sentence. He was also ordered to return the 700,000 taels of silver to CMSNC for the damages and interest accrued from the date of the damage, amounting to a total of 1.2 million taels. Li Sihao, the current chairman of the Economic Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, and Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a business leader in this city, posted bail on June 6th of this year for the civil lawsuit portion of the case. However, almost five months have passed since the bail was posted without a single payment. CMSNC has also published rewards to locate Li Guojie's private property, but without success. CMSNC filed a petition with the local court to continue the execution. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Judge Yu Lude convened an execution hearing. Jiang Hechun, an attorney representing CMSNC, and Lu Shifang and Wu Taiyu, attorneys representing Li Guojie as assistants, reported to the court. Attorney Jiang, representing the plaintiff, stated that the execution of the civil lawsuit was attached to the criminal case. Since June 6th, when bail was posted, and in July, when notice was served for the reporting of assets, the defendant was ordered to pay at least one-tenth of the amount, but has not paid a single cent to date. Therefore, he requested the court to pursue the principal amount of 700,000 taels of silver and the interest. At this point, the judge asked Li Guojie, "You should not delay payment." Li replied, "I should abide by the court's judgment, but I have no assets, so I am trying my best to find a solution." The judge asked, "Then how will you handle it?" Li replied, "CMSNC has already offered a reward to find my property." At this point, his attorney, Lu, stated, "CMSNC belongs to the Ministry of Transportation, and the Ministry of Transportation belongs to the Executive Yuan. Li Guojie was implicated due to official duties, so he has submitted a petition to the Premier of the Executive Yuan for exemption from payment." The judge said, "This case is now a legal issue. Regarding the debt, it cannot be suspended unless the creditor applies to dismiss the case. Your request today is without legal basis." Attorney Jiang, representing the plaintiff, stated, "The defendant was previously detained for three years and did not settle the debt. The reward offered to find his assets has only uncovered two properties that are currently under investigation. If we drag this on for another year or six months and still have no results, what can we do? Therefore, the plaintiff requests either an order for detention or a request for bankruptcy proceedings under the court's authority." Attorney Lu, representing the defendant, stated, "The defendant is a person of standing and does not wish to declare bankruptcy." Thereupon, Attorney Jiang, representing the plaintiff, requested that the case be handled according to bankruptcy law, while the defendant's attorney objected. After arguing, the judge ordered the defendant to provide assets within half a month and adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Rainfall Seven Inches Less Than Last Year; Rainfall in the Yangtze River Basin Even Scarcer</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn, Shanghai has experienced scarce rainfall, leading to a gradual drought. Farmers in the suburbs are eagerly awaiting rain. At the same time, the water level of the Yangtze River is steadily drying up, making navigation increasingly difficult. The situation is summarized below:</p>
<p>This Year's Rainfall</p>
<p>According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who inquired with the Hydrology Department of the Xunpu General Bureau, the rainfall record for Shanghai from January 1st to October 31st of this year is only 33.68 inches. Compared to the same period last year (also January to the end of October), which had 40.75 inches, the rainfall this year has decreased by more than 7.07 inches.</p>
<p>Two-Month Comparison</p>
<p>Comparing September and October, Shanghai's rainfall in September of last year was 4.8 inches, while it was only 1.7 inches in September of this year. Last year's rainfall in October was 1.72 inches, while there was absolutely no rainfall in October of this year. This type of autumn drought is rare in recent years. No wonder farmers in the suburbs are eagerly awaiting rain. It is also understood that rainfall in the Yangtze River basin this year is even less than in Shanghai, so it is only natural that the river water is drying up.</p>
<p>Yesterday Morning's Heavy Fog</p>
<p>Shanghai has seen hazy conditions for several consecutive nights, with the fog being especially heavy yesterday morning. It was difficult to recognize faces even at close range. The Huangpu River was misty, as if locked in by a heavy fog. As a result, all sails temporarily ceased rowing, and many ocean-going vessels remained outside the port. The heavy fog only dissipated around 9:00 AM, after which water traffic resumed. The CNAC Shanghai-Hankou flight was also delayed yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Two Guarantors Withdraw Guaranty One After Another; Bao Gang Detained; Guarantors Became Suspicious of His Absence; Court Orders Detention</h3>
<p>Bao Gang, a lawyer, was sued in the local court by Cui Changgui, a driver for the Special Task Force of the Shanghai Municipal Police, for seducing his fiancée, Yang Yuehua, and instigating a divorce, hiding her in Chuansha. During the criminal court's hearing, Bao Gang initially only provided a bond for appearance upon summons, which was later supplemented with a cash bond of 3,000 yuan. However, on the afternoon of the 29th, a subpoena was delivered to the guarantor for a continued hearing. Bao then claimed illness and failed to appear. The guarantor, becoming suspicious of Bao's absence, went to Bao's residence that evening to investigate. He found the place empty, with only a servant who refused to speak. Suddenly, a phone call came. The guarantor answered the phone and recognized Bao Gang's voice. When asked why he had not appeared, Bao abruptly hung up. The guarantor immediately inquired with the telephone bureau and learned that the call originated from No. 9 Annaquin Road. He immediately hired a car and rushed there, finding Bao about to leave. He stopped him and accompanied him to the Wu Gong Hotel in the International Settlement, ostensibly to discuss the matter, and kept watch overnight. The next day, the 30th, the guarantor, Huang Zhichang, hired a lawyer to go to the local court and request Bao Gang's arrest and the withdrawal of the guaranty. By the time the court documents were completed, it was already 4:00 PM. Police officers Cao Ziqian and Tang Shixun were dispatched to the Wu Gong Hotel. Unexpectedly, Bao Gang had gone out to buy something at 2:00 PM and did not return to the Wu Gong Hotel until around 8:00 PM. He was arrested by the police officers and sent to the Lao Zha Police Station for detention. Yesterday (the 31st), he was transferred to the First Special District Court. After the bailiffs delivered the documents, Bao Gang, a lawyer, was brought back to the local court. Xie Zhengong, a judge, convened court at 10:00 AM. The guarantor, Huang Zhichang, testified about Bao Gang's conduct and stated that he was now unwilling to act as guarantor and requested to withdraw the guaranty. Subsequently, Zhu Jianhong, the former guarantor for appearance upon summons, also filed a case stating that he was no longer willing to act as guarantor and requested to withdraw the guaranty. At this point, Bao Gang said, "I really had no intention of fleeing. They misunderstood." He requested to provide another guaranty. The judge said, "You are a lawyer and should know the law. You should abide by the law. Your current foolish behavior is really detrimental to you. Your request for guaranty is now denied. We will wait until after the judgment." He then ordered Bao Gang to be detained.</p>
<h3>Gu Zhensheng Sends Four Threatening Letters to a Western Woman; Demands 1,000 Yuan in Legal Tender; Arrested and Admits to Writing the Letters</h3>
<p>Gu Zhensheng, a native of Pudong, is 24 years old and works as a chauffeur. He lives at No. 66, Lane 17, Longmen Road. Recently, Gu lost his job and often went to the Buddhist Research Association at No. 443 Great Western Road. He often saw Madame S. Lawhood (aged 73), a Western woman who lived in the opposite house at No. 53, acting extravagantly and traveling by car. He suddenly had a bad idea. On the 23rd of this month, he wrote a threatening letter in English and mailed it to the Western woman, intending to extort 1,000 yuan. He instructed her to send it by chauffeur to Room 1, Gongyu 404, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, otherwise he would take her life when she went out for fun or to see a movie. After receiving the letter, the Western woman immediately reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Chinese Detective Wu Chengmo and Western Detective Kai Tai were dispatched to the apartment to investigate. They found that Room 1 was occupied by a Russian, so there were no results. Subsequently, Gu wrote letters again on the 25th and 27th, demanding 1,000 yuan from the Western woman. This time, he requested that it be delivered to Lu Ban in Room B-28, Pao Ma Gongyu, Pao Ma Ting Road. The Chinese and Western detectives went to wait, and although they met Gu Zhensheng (who was wearing a navy blue Zhongshan suit) wandering around the area, they did not arrest him because there was no evidence. Unexpectedly, they received a fourth letter the day before yesterday, instructing the woman to send the money in front of the Nanking Theatre on Avenue Edward the day before yesterday. The Chinese and Western detectives went to wait again and saw Gu going back and forth, acting suspiciously. They arrested him. Gu immediately admitted that he had written the threatening letters. They went to his residence and confiscated a bottle of ink and a pen. He was taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police Lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted him for attempted extortion under Article 346 of the Criminal Code and presented the facts of the case, requesting a postponement. After Judge Huang Risheng briefly questioned the defendant Gu Zhensheng, he ordered him to be detained and scheduled another hearing in seven days.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association to Award Prizes for Member Recruitment</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after the closing of the Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association's Third Member Recruitment Congress, various teams continued to submit points. As of yesterday, another 1,376 points were recruited by Mi Jifang, Zheng Hairuo, Xu Yefu, and others. Together with the previous points, the total is 8,759 points, exceeding the predetermined target by more than 2,370 points, with very satisfactory results. An award ceremony will be held on November 11th. National products factories that agree to the association's preferential purchase plan for members include Taikang Food Company, Central Glass, Yijue Enamel Company, China Food Company, Yapur and Hwart Electric Bulb Factory, Shengchang, Guanyuan Canned Food Company, China Bookstore, China Chemical Industry Society, and Samsung Cotton and Iron Factory, offering discounts ranging from 70% to 90% of the list price. As for the association's "One Day Contribution to the Country" donation from each member, it has been decided to ask them to send it directly to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for centralized transfer to the government. In addition, according to the report of the Nanyang Inspection Group, national products manufacturers often have the common problem of goods not matching the samples, which hinders overseas sales. A special letter has been sent to each member to pay attention and collect information for compiling a national products list.</p>
<h3>National Products Production and Sales Association Invites Physician from Health Association to Lecture; Factory Leaders Express Deep Agreement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Health Assurance Association has recently seen its work develop rapidly, with the total number of participating groups and individual members reaching more than 7,000. An average of about 50 people come to the association for diagnosis every day. The physicians of various specialties provide careful diagnosis and treatment, almost bringing back life, deeply winning the trust of members. Various national products factories in this city have aroused common attention to this public welfare cause of health protection. In order to understand the purpose and content of the association, they have successively invited the association to give public lectures. The association, based on its responsibilities, is extremely willing to closely contact the industrial and commercial circles in order to protect the health of laborers and reduce the pain of diseases. Yesterday noon, the China National Products Production and Sales Association held a luncheon at Zhengyi Society. More than 100 factory leaders attended. Mr. Wang Zhixin presided over the meeting. After delivering an introductory speech, Mr. Chen Zhongjiu, the executive director of the Health Association, delivered a speech, saying that in recent years, major factories have been able to pay attention to labor hygiene and medical affairs in response to the needs of the times. Each factory employs a factory doctor specifically for the treatment of employees. However, with the progress of modern medicine, one or two factory doctors can hardly treat various diseases. It is necessary to have specialized medical consultations. The establishment of the Health Association meets the needs of this kind of fact. The association employs specialized doctors of various departments. Once a factory joins as a member, it can obtain the consultation of specialized doctors of various departments at a comparable price, which is the most economical and appropriate method. Subsequently, Dr. Li Zhongyong, the director of the association, delivered a speech, saying that the industrial sector requires an increase in production and work efficiency. It is necessary to first pay attention to the soundness of the workers' bodies. The Municipal Health Association is willing to dedicate its greatest efforts to this. First, it stipulates group membership to reduce membership fees; second, it provides specialized treatment to obtain expert consultation; and third, it guides factory hygiene and prevents the spread of diseases. The representatives expressed deep agreement with the opinions of Mr. Chen and Dr. Li. The meeting ended at half past two.</p>
<h3>Yang Ziqiu and Others Have Wild Ideas; Pretend to Be Dead People to Swindle Money; Familiar with the Owners of Various Villas in Moganshan; Accomplice Yang Dafu Has Also Been Apprehended</h3>
<p>Yang Ziqiu, a native of Anhui, because his father used to watch over villas in Moganshan, Hangzhou, for Wu Dengying, knew the surnames of the owners of the villas on the mountain. Recently, he colluded with his fellow villager Yang Dafu in Shanghai to defraud the villa owners of money. Initially, they were not discovered. Until the morning of the day before yesterday, Yang Dafu called Pan Ziyi, the acting director of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., at Room S3, Hwa Mow Apartment, No. 173 Seymour Road, and reported that the wife of the steward Li Shengbiao of his Moganshan villa had died, asking for financial assistance. Pan immediately agreed to give 30 yuan. Because Pan was a shareholder of the Nanyang Injunction Company, he ordered Yang to collect it from Deng Wenneng at the company. However, Yang Ziqiu had already gone to the Nanyang Company the day before to tell General Manager Jian Yujie that the wife of Li Shengbiao, the steward of Jian's villa in Moganshan, had died, and Li was asking for help with the funeral expenses. Jian initially agreed to give 30 yuan, but then increased it by 15 yuan. This amount was also ordered to be transferred to Ziqiu by Deng. At the time, Deng saw that what Dafu was collecting was also funeral expenses for Li's wife, and realized that these people were accomplices, specializing in fabricating events and defrauding various parties. He reported it to the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station. Detective Tang Zihong and detective Zhou Kaiwen were dispatched to first arrest Yang Dafu. According to his confession, Yang Ziqiu was hiding in Room 15, Jingsheng Hotel, North Sea Road. They went to the address and continued to arrest Yang Ziqiu, confiscating a forged seal of Hangzhou Huilan Middle School Moganshan Zhao Zhaosong Construction Factory and factory owner Zhao Xirong, as well as two receipts, one for receiving 300 yuan from Chen Mansion (rumored to be Chen Bingqian) and one for receiving 50 yuan from Feng Mansion, both stamped with Zhao's seal. In addition, after Detective Tang verified that the two Yangs had used the same method to swindle 30 yuan from Pan Yucun at No. 21, Lane 608, Yu Yuan Road, the two Yangs were sent to the First Special District Local Court yesterday morning. Judge Ye Shengchao questioned them. Police Lawyer Qian Xunjiu briefly stated the facts of the case, saying that there were probably more victims of the defendants' deception, and that the households that had been identified were requesting an extension to continue the investigation. Judge Ye then interrogated the two defendants, ordered them to be detained, and rescheduled the hearing in seven days, while the body of Jiang Ershi was inspected at the scene by Court Prosecutor Zhang Zongru, who determined that the cause of death of the deceased Jiang Ershi was unknown and ordered a forensic examination. The body was handed over to her father, Jiang Yinchuan, for burial.</p>

<h3>"The Far Eastern Crisis" to Cease Reprinting</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the China Tongyi Society and Wenhua Printing House reprinted Mr. Stimson's "The Far Eastern Crisis" inexpensively to popularize the book.

It is heard that the China Tongyi Society and Wenhua Printing Bureau have voluntarily stopped reprinting. All advance orders that have been placed will be refunded and cancelled.</p>
<h3>Jiang Erbao Pregnant; Abortion Death Requires Autopsy; Ju Jiuhua Arrested for Causing the Incident; Involved Zhou Wang and Chen</h3>
<p>Jiang Erbao, the 22-year-old daughter of Jiang Yinchuan, an Yixing native residing at No. 15 Wender Lane, Linqing Road, works as a female worker at the Rende Yarn Factory on the same road. She had a romantic relationship with Ju Jiuhua (28 years old), a Qingjiang native residing at No. 60 Fululi, Yangshupu Road, for a long time. Later, she became secretly pregnant and her abdomen became swollen. Because the girl had been betrothed to a certain clan from her hometown in her childhood, she discussed with Ju on September 24th that she was six months pregnant and decided to have an abortion. Ju paid five yuan and asked Zhou Wang, a woman living in the three-story loft, to find a midwife for an abortion. Until November 14, Zhou found Zhou Chen, an old woman from the same hometown of Yixing, to come to her home. She stated that the handling fee was eight yuan. At 6:00 PM, she inserted medicinal herbs into the girl's vagina. The next day, the fetus was aborted, but the inside was injured. She became ill and bedridden from then on. The girl's illness worsened the day before yesterday and she was on the verge of death. Her father was impatient and reported the situation to the Mushupu Police Station. Detective Hou Fulin was dispatched to investigate and found that it was true. The girl was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by car, but it was ineffective. She died at 4:00 PM. The body was taken to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road, and Zhou Chen, Zhou Wang, and Ju Jiuhua (an employee of the Shanghai Electric Power Company), three men and women, were all taken into custody at the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fifth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Counsel Zhang Shizhu of the Public Works Department stated the facts of the case and said that in order to best determine whether Jiang's death was due to an abortion or disease, it was best to ask a forensic doctor to perform an autopsy. The three defendants were detained for further investigation. After that, the father of the girl, Jiang Yinchuan, stated the course of events and questioned the statements of the two clans and Ju's confession. Judge Zhong Qing ordered them to be returned to custody and re-examined on another day, while the body of Jiang Ershi was examined by Zhang Zongru, a prosecutor from the court. He stated that the cause of death of the deceased Jiang Ershi was unknown and ordered a forensic examination. After the autopsy, the body was handed over to her father, Jiang Yinchuan, for burial.</p>
<h3>Joint Effort by Education and Film Industries: Film Education Company Established to Promote the Industry and Supply Equipment</h3>
<p>Party and government leaders, educators, and prominent figures in the film industry in this city, recognizing film education as a universally acknowledged tool for social education, and given the enthusiastic promotion by the government and society in our country in recent years, but noting that the supply of equipment relies entirely on foreign powers and is subject to their control, which seriously hinders the development of film education in our country, have organized the "China Film Education Equipment Co., Ltd." After a year of preparation and sufficient fundraising, the inaugural meeting was held on August 22nd, and registration has been filed according to law. Fang Zhi, Pan Gongzhan, Jiang Jianbai, Chen Gongsu, Zhou Bangjun, Tao Shengbai, Bian Yuwu, Sun Daosheng, and Lu Jiangbai have been elected as directors. The grand opening is today. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Grand Opening Today</p>
<p>The company has ordered the latest miniaturized film printers, film processing machines, automatic light meters, and other equipment from abroad, costing seventy to eighty thousand in gold. These have already been shipped and technical experts have been hired to oversee operations. Most preparations are now complete, and the grand opening is scheduled for 10:00 AM today. The business department is located at 400 Fuzhou Road in this city, and the technical department is located at 225 Yanping Road. In addition to managing educational films and small-sized positive and negative film reels from various countries, as well as various projection and photographic equipment, miniaturization, duplication, and processing of small-sized films, the company also plans to manufacture projectors, magic lanterns, film splicers, and other equipment. It is expected that products will be available by next spring, aiming to recover lost rights and prevent the outflow of wealth. It is reported that before the opening, the company, being the only one operated by Chinese, has received considerable support from various parties and has already received many orders.</p>
<p>Opening Declaration</p>
<p>Our country's high rate of illiteracy is well-known throughout the world. Now, our government, recognizing electrical education as a powerful tool for promoting social education and imparting knowledge to the people, has allocated funds, trained specialists, and vigorously promoted its implementation. Therefore, the need for electrical education equipment is extremely urgent. Due to the immaturity of our country's industry and the backwardness of production, electrical education equipment still relies on foreign countries for supply. In the past, private promotion has resulted in significant outflows of wealth. In the future, as film education becomes increasingly developed, the demand for foreign goods will increase, and the outflow of money will also become greater. Moreover, it is inevitable that foreign merchants will monopolize and hoard goods. In the long run, this will be a major obstacle to the future development of electrical education. Our company, after a year of preparation, with the support of prominent party and state figures and members of society, has been established. Although it is a commercial organization, its primary goal is to actively manufacture electrical education equipment and assist the government in promoting film education. At the beginning, we will start with miniaturization, duplication, and film processing, and manage educational films and film reels from various countries to meet the needs of all parties. We also plan to manufacture film equipment and all necessary supplies, hoping to prevent the outflow of wealth and facilitate the government's procurement of electrical education equipment, thus fulfilling our national duty to the best of our ability. On this opening day, we respectfully announce our mission to our fellow countrymen, hoping for your guidance.</p>
<p>Scope of Business</p>
<p>(A) Technical Department: (1) Provides film miniaturization services using the latest miniaturized 16mm film printer.

<h3>Coarse Grains Industry Association Sends Letter to Local Associations Regarding Food Regulation; Requests Transmission by Telegram to Authorities to Revoke Provincial Bans; Zhejiang Rice is Allowed to Ship After Guarantee and Continues to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Following Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Coarse Grains Industry Association, presenting a petition to the Ministry of Industry of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing the night before, the association sent another letter to local associations yesterday morning outlining the reasons why banning the export of grain from provinces is inappropriate, requesting that it be forwarded to the authorities to revoke the provincial bans. The rice boats detained in Jiaxing, Pinghu, Jiashan, and other places in Zhejiang have all been released after guarantees and are now arriving in Shanghai successively. Therefore, the food supply for Shanghai citizens is not affected, and prices are stable and have not risen sharply. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to Local Associations</p>
<p>Having read in the newspaper that the Jiangsu Provincial Government has resolved to strictly prohibit the export of food grains, and having received reports from colleagues that the Zhejiang Provincial Government has already ordered all counties to implement the seizure and prevention of rice shipments and prohibit the export of rice grains across provinces, if each province acts on its own and bans the export of rice grains, it will inevitably cause panic among the people regarding food. This is because some regions are fertile and others are barren, and production varies. If provinces successively prohibit exports, regions with surplus rice grains will have an excess, and prices will fall, while regions lacking rice will suffer from a shortage and be helpless. The ancients valued the importance of food to the people, and the meaning of transferring grain was of utmost importance. Therefore, our association has deep concerns about the strict prohibition of exporting food grains from provinces. We hereby present a summary of the reasons why it is inappropriate to prohibit the export of food grains from provinces, and we earnestly request your consideration and forwarding to the government authorities to revoke the ban and withdraw the order so that domestic food grains can still be handled in accordance with the clear order of the central government in November 1932 regarding the circulation of domestic rice grains, so as to regulate food supply and avoid famine. We hereby present our humble opinions as follows: Our government is currently promoting rural economic development and regulating the national food supply, which are the only policies for the rejuvenation of China. The government has already promulgated clear orders for the circulation of domestic grains. Now, if we prohibit exports from provinces, it is a self-defeating action and not a sincere effort to balance surpluses and deficiencies and care for the food supply of the whole people. This is the first reason why it is inappropriate to prohibit exports from provinces. Our country is fortunate to have a bountiful harvest this year. However, there are many provinces that rely on neighboring provinces for assistance. If one province prohibits exports, and another province suffers from a shortage of food, it is a hidden worry like Wu and Yue looking at each other. This is the second reason why it is inappropriate to prohibit exports from provinces. If it is said that we must strictly prohibit exports abroad in order to strengthen national defense and prevent assisting the enemy, our colleagues have already recognized this and the Coarse Grains and Oil Cake Industry Association has resolved to propose recommendations that have been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government for consideration and implementation. Domestic circulation should be promoted so as to regulate the food supply. If exports from provinces are prohibited and passports are required for transportation, it is feared that cunning people will take the opportunity to engage in activities and create illicit funds, which is unbearable for the people. This is the third reason why it is inappropriate to prohibit exports from provinces. Rural areas deeply fear bankruptcy. Fortunately, this year's rice grain harvest is slightly better, and there may be hope for recovery. Now, the prohibition of exports from provinces by Zhejiang and Jiangsu will cause the rural areas in the surplus rice areas to suffer from an excess of rice grains and low prices, which will harm farmers. The deficit provinces will inevitably suffer from rice shortages. This matter concerns the people's livelihood and is not a trivial matter. This is the fourth reason why it is inappropriate to prohibit exports from provinces. Provinces governing themselves and counties governing themselves are the corrupt policies of the warlord era, and there is no need to hide it. Now is the time for the government to work hard and renew itself with the people. Regardless of provinces or counties, there should be no divisions and everyone should be treated equally. This is the fifth reason why it is inappropriate to prohibit exports from provinces. Shanghai is not a rice-producing region and has always relied on neighboring provinces for food supply. Now that neighboring provinces are prohibiting exports, the sources of supply to Shanghai are gradually decreasing. The daily food consumption of more than three million people in the city depends on the supply from producing areas. Without this supply, not only will there be panic about food, but the security situation will also be greatly affected. This is the sixth reason why it is inappropriate to prohibit exports from provinces. In summary, our representatives dare not remain silent and hereby present our opinions. We earnestly request your association to consider and immediately telegraph the authorities to revoke the ban so as to maintain the food supply of Shanghai citizens. We would be immensely grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Local Association by representatives of the Coarse Grains and Oil Cake Industry Association, Gu Xinyi, Zhu Zixiang, Yan Xiaoxiang, Cai Yukun, and Chen Ziyi.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Approval</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Government Approval No. 4158. The original presenter, Shanghai Coarse Grains and Oil Cake Industry Association, presents a document regarding the prohibition of the export of food grains by Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, requesting that it be forwarded for release in order to maintain the food supply of the people. The contents are noted. A telegram has been sent to the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Please be informed. This approval is dated October 30, 1936, by Mayor Wu Tiecheng.</p>
<h3>Li Sihao Returned to Shanghai Yesterday; Will Go to Nanjing and Then Return to Peiping</h3>
<p>Li Sihao, Chairman of the Economic Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, flew from Peiping to Shanghai on the 27th. On the same day, he returned to his ancestral home in Zhangting, Cixi, to visit his uncle who was ill. After staying there for three days, he took the Sanbei Company's Ningxing ship, which he had taken on his previous trip to Ningbo Zhenhai, and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning at 9:30. After disembarking at the Ning Shao Pier on 16th Street, he returned to his private residence on Yuyuan Road for a short rest and then went out, not returning until late at night. It is understood that Mr. Li will stay in Shanghai for three or four days, complete matters related to the Dazhong Bank and other affairs, and then go to Nanjing to consult with Foreign Minister Zhang and Minister Wu for instructions. Then, he will take his family north to return to Peiping. As for the matter of Mr. Li negotiating the restoration of the China Exchange Bank in Shanghai, all parties are quite indifferent to this. Mr. Li knows that there are many difficulties in this matter and has not proceeded with it.</p>
<h3>Sa Zhenbing Returned to Fujian Yesterday; Xu Zufan and Others Hosted a Banquet to Welcome Him</h3>
<p>Admiral Sa Zhenbing, a veteran of the navy, recently went to Nanjing and various other places for inspections. He met with Yan Xishan, Feng Yuxiang, and others. After finishing his affairs in Nanjing, Mr. Sa arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Xu Zufan and other important figures from the navigation industry hosted a banquet to welcome him. During the banquet, Mr. Sa praised the rapid progress of construction in various parts of the interior, the improvement of roads and transportation, and the greatness of President Chiang's governance and his spirit and perseverance. Mr. Sa was eager to return to Fujian and left Shanghai on the Sanbei Company's Wanxiang ship yesterday to return to Fuzhou. Important figures from the navigation industry went to Pier No. 13 in Nanshi to see him off.</p>
<h3>Numerous Shipping Accidents Reported on the Yangtze River; Tonghua Runs Aground Twice</h3>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tonghua vessel, currently sailing on the Shanghai-Hankou route due to the congestion of cargo on the Yangtze River, was fully loaded with grain from Hankou and scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday. However, when the vessel arrived at the entrance of the waterway at Wusongkou, due to heavy fog in the morning, the pilot, for cautious navigation, was sailing closer to the waterway when the tide suddenly dropped significantly, and the water depth there was only eight feet. The Tonghua ran aground. The shipowner immediately telegraphed Shanghai for assistance. However, before long, the afternoon tide rose significantly, and the Tonghua automatically floated out of the shallows. The Shanghai Bureau was relieved to receive the telegram reporting that the vessel had floated free. However, at 2:45 PM, the Bureau received a third urgent telegram from the Tonghua stating that the vessel had run aground a second time opposite the Lion Grove Fort at Wusongkou. The water depth there was nine feet, but the Tonghua's draft was fifteen feet nine inches, causing it to become deeply embedded in the seabed and unable to move. The Bureau was requested to immediately dispatch a large tugboat with three barges to Wusongkou to unload the cargo onto the barges and send it to Shanghai first, and then attempt to tow the vessel. Upon receiving the report, the Bureau dispatched the tugboat and barges as requested at 6:00 PM yesterday, ordering them to unload the Tonghua's cargo by 3:00 AM this morning and then attempt to tow the vessel.</p>
<p>Huangpu River in Tow</p>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Yangtze River vessel Huangpu left Shanghai at 2:00 AM on the 29th. That evening, when passing the Jiaoshan section of the Yangtze River in Zhenjiang, the water level dropped significantly. Huang Youzhi, the shipowner of the Jiangxin vessel, had previously reported this and asked the navigation industry to pay attention. The grounding of the Huangpu vessel occurred at Crossing Baouy, where the water flow is turbulent and there are hidden reefs. Due to the receding water, these obstacles were preventing navigation. The Huangpu immediately raised a red light for help. The Jiangxin vessel passed by but, because it was heavily loaded and had a deep draft, did not dare to tow the Huangpu. Instead, it reported the incident to the Zhenjiang Customs and telegraphed the Shanghai Bureau, informing the Taikoo Company. Upon receiving the report, Taikoo immediately telegraphed its Yangtze River vessels that were en route, ordering them to rush to the scene to tow the Huangpu. If the vessel could not be freed quickly, the passengers would be transferred to other vessels going upstream and the cargo would be unloaded. Fortunately, the tides have been relatively high recently, making rescue easier.</p>
<p>Huiping Runs Aground and is Damaged</p>
<p>The captain of the Huitong Steamship Company's Huiping vessel telegraphed yesterday, stating that the Huiping had loaded cargo in Andong and was sailing to Dalian when it ran aground near the newly built Marus Lighthouse in Dadonggou due to the receding tide. The vessel's coal bunker deck and other parts were damaged. The Huiping line in Shanghai received the news and informed the insurance company. Further details of the grounding and damage assessment are awaiting a detailed report from the ship.</p>
<h3>Hongxing Labor Dispute Resolved; Work Resumed Yesterday; Months of Stalemate Now Concluded</h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, all the workers of the Hongxing Hosiery Factory at 221 Caishi Road in the French Concession initiated the organization of a labor union in May of this year. Due to disagreements with the factory management, disputes arose repeatedly, and no resolution was reached. Currently, labor and management have filed lawsuits against each other. Although the initial trial has been judged, the labor side is not satisfied and is still appealing. The second labor strike, which began on September 9th, has lasted for two months. Now, both labor and management believe that the prolonged dispute is not beneficial to society. Therefore, in accordance with the Social Affairs Bureau's instructions, with the exception of worker Wang Xiuying, who is temporarily suspended from returning to work, all other workers have returned to the factory to resume work in stages from the 28th to yesterday. The labor dispute, which lasted for four to five months, has finally been completely resolved.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society Establishes Rickshaw Puller Insurance; All 40,000 Members Insured; Deaths Account for the Majority of Claims</h3>
<p>Labor insurance has been practiced in European and American countries for a long time, and its grand scale has long been praised by the general public. Looking back at our country, it is still not very common, which is regrettable. However, the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society of the Public Concession in this city began to offer rickshaw puller insurance on Labor Day (May 1st) of this year. Claims are paid quickly, and the results are remarkable, truly pioneering labor insurance in our country. Moreover, its scale is quite large, with more than 41,000 insured, making it the largest in the Far East. It can serve as a reference for those in our country who are enthusiastic about social welfare. Excerpts are provided below:</p>
<p>Organization</p>
<p>The Society originally had a mutual aid department specifically for the relief of rickshaw pullers in the event of death or disability. However, to strengthen the protection of rickshaw pullers, a Member Insurance Department was established on May 1st of this year, with a resolution to allocate 30,000 yuan of funds to establish an Insurance Committee. The Board of Directors appointed Zhu Maocheng, Ke Ganchen, Lu Weili, Yan Chengde, Qiu Zitong, Han Yushan, He Wushan, and Gu Zhiling as members, with Zhu Maocheng serving as chairman and Yan Chengde serving as accountant, all on a voluntary basis. The position of manager is concurrently held by Zhang Dengying, the Secretary-General of the Society, who also does not receive additional salary. Therefore, the expenses of the department are very economical.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>As for the insurance methods, it has been stipulated that for all registered rickshaw pullers, the insurance compensation for each person is 40 yuan in national currency. Those who die for any reason (excluding those who commit a capital crime) or who lose both limbs, both hands, or both feet, or one foot and one hand, or who become blind in both eyes, or who become blind in one eye and permanently disabled in one hand or one foot due to accidental danger or other reasons, will receive full compensation. Those who become blind in one eye or permanently disabled in one hand or one foot due to accidental danger or other reasons will receive half the compensation. Moreover, compensation is paid extremely quickly, and must be paid within 24 hours whenever possible. According to the person in charge of the Society, since the insurance was launched, as of the end of September this year, there have been 112 cases of compensation, with a total payment of less than 5,000 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Analysis</p>
<p>According to the Society's analysis, deaths accounted for the largest majority of all 112 compensation cases, with 107 cases, accounting for more than 95%. There were only nine disability cases. Among the deaths, endemic diseases, epidemics, and infectious diseases accounted for the largest number, with 59 people, including typhoid fever (13 people), relapsing fever (6 people), malaria (5 people), dysentery (6 people), respiratory tuberculosis (16 people), influenza, gastric disease, meningeal and central nervous system tuberculosis, and tertiary syphilis (1 person each). Common cancers accounted for 6 people, including liver and stomach cancer and malignant tumors (2 people), peritoneal, intestinal, and rectal cancer, and other malignant tumors (1 person). Chronic rheumatism, osteoarthritis, and gout (2 people). Beriberi (1 person). Circulatory system diseases (4 people), including angina and other heart diseases (2 people). Respiratory diseases (8 people), including throat disease (1 person), pneumonia and asthma (2 people each), bronchitis (2 people), and other respiratory diseases (1 person). Digestive system diseases (18 people), of which diarrhea and enteritis accounted for 12 people, stomach diseases (4 people), and other digestive system diseases (2 people). Non-venereal diseases of the urinary system (1 person). Among the 107 rickshaw pullers who died, the age group of 45 to 49 years old was the largest, with 23 people, followed by 40 to 44 years old (19 people), 25 to 29 years old, and 30 to 34 years old (13 people each), 35 to 39 years old and 50 to 54 years old (12 people each). On average, most were around 40 years old, accounting for two-thirds of the total. Based on this calculation, each rickshaw puller can survive to be 43 years old, which shows a glimpse of the life of a rickshaw puller.</p>

<p>Zhejiang Literature Exhibition Special Issue</p>
<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>— Xu Shaodi</p>
<p>Since the Tang and Song dynasties, Zhejiang has long been a land of culture and relics. In the history of Chinese culture, both Zhejiang provinces have had unlimited glory. In recent years, while Zhejiang's construction projects have been progressing rapidly, the education community has not dared to slack off. Despite difficult material conditions, it has strived for various improvements and has achieved some results. It has always been believed that the education cause has a wide range of objects and many aspects. In school education, in the history, geography, and civics subjects, we should pay attention to the lectures on the deeds of the sages of our hometowns to arouse their admiration and inspiration. To broaden and deepen its effectiveness, we should especially use the methods of social education so that the general public can feel its influence. This is the meaning of the exhibition.</p>
<p>In 1934, Zhejiang Province held a provincial conditions exhibition, which was rich in the meaning of local education. However, the scope of the exhibition was wider, and the collection of literature of the sages of this province was rare. In recent years, the Education Department has always been responsible for praising the humanistic aspects of the previous generations to the local libraries and folk education centers, and in 1935, it was included in the plan to hold a Zhejiang Literature Exhibition. The Provincial Library has been collecting new and old books and has been paying attention to the collection and collation of literature from this province. Therefore, it was assigned to the library to host the event, which began on October 1st of this year after a period of preparation. During the solicitation, collection branches were set up in various special districts of the province and in Beijing, Ping, and Shanghai, and the heads of the counties were ordered by the Education Department to engage in the collection, and exhibitions were held in each county or district before selecting the best to send to the province. The power of the group inside and outside the province was gathered, and a large number of writings, calligraphy, portraits, rubbings, and cultural relics of the local sages were collected, which is a matter of deep consolation.</p>
<p>The purpose of the exhibition is to elaborate on the literature of Zhejiang Province and promote artistic education. However, what I want to say to the people of the province and the visiting guests is that when we look at the various cultural relics on display, we can see the essence of the ancient carved editions, but what we should pay attention to is definitely not only this form. We should think of the people from the objects, and know how the sages of Zhejiang diligently studied and practiced, how they were loyal to the country, and how they connected their lives with the safety and survival of the nation, and did not hesitate to give up their lives and property for the country. This great and magnificent spirit of the local sages should be deeply understood, carried forward, and promoted by us. The feeling of love for the hometown is aroused, and the spirit of the nation is inspired by the love for the hometown, and it is dedicated to our troubled country. The exhibition will not be criticized for playing with things and losing ambition and being infatuated with the past, but it can exert its profound educational significance. The exhibition will be edited and published in the daily newspaper, so I will write down my feelings at the beginning.</p>
<h3>The Purpose of the Zhejiang Literature Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Chen Xunci</p>
<p>Since the opening of the sea, the customs have gradually changed. Zhejiang, a land of cultural relics, has contributed to today's academic undertakings in many ways, but the industry of praising and examining the humanities of the previous generations is gradually being abandoned. Therefore, the study and research of ancient classics is gradually becoming rare, and those who know the literature sigh. The Zhejiang Provincial Library inherits the old traditions of Wenlan, gathers the classics of the new and the old, and always tries its best to preserve and promote the literature of the province. This time, under the command of the Education Department, the Zhejiang Literature Exhibition is held, relying on the help of all walks of life inside and outside the province, and the collection of exhibits has been quite complete. At the beginning of the exhibition, I would like to state the four meanings of the meeting in order to clarify the purpose of the meeting, and also to discuss with the sages at home and abroad.</p>
<p>First, collect and preserve the writings of local scholars. The scholars of Zhejiang have written as many books as there are trees in the forest. The Siku Quanshu records 1,390 authors, 743 books, and a total of 2,268 books. The number of books that were lost by the Siku and those that were written after Qianlong and were not included is undoubtedly countless. How much more are there that have not been published, or have been printed but are rarely passed down? Nowadays, private collections are declining, and libraries want to collect and visit but are short of funds. This exhibition collects the collections of more than 70 counties in Zhejiang Province and collectors inside and outside the province. Not only can the original manuscripts of famous authors be compared, but the scholars of the rocks and the cloth will also have the effect of elucidating the mysteries and expressing the micro by this collection. After the meeting, the objects will be returned to their original owners. Even if the Zhejiang Library is unable to make copies of the most isolated copies, it will be enough to provide scholars with information and pass on the essence of the former philosophers.</p>
<p>Second, promote the academic style of Zhejiang. The development of culture in Zhejiang has benefited from the migration of the nation to the south in the Jin and Song dynasties. Therefore, the scholarship has also been flourishing since the Southern Song Dynasty. Since then, the sectarian styles have been passed down, and the local habits have been nurtured. It has gradually established its own special academic style. Such as being broad and able to keep the agreement, tolerant and not establishing portals, diligently studying and not neglecting practice, managing the world and focusing on practical use, in the scholars of Zhejiang in recent centuries, there is often a common spirit to be found. And in the study of classics, philosophy, literature, and even the study of xiangjiao, Zhejiang has had leaders in all generations, forming a flourishing trend of dividing ways and advancing together. As shown in this exhibition, it is even more possible to see the beauty of the academic style of Zhejiang throughout the ages. Unfortunately, since the world has become more urgent, scholars have tended to seek immediate results, and the fashion of practicing in seclusion has gradually declined. The decline of Zhejiang learning is fearful. How can we elucidate the excellent academic style of our sages of the past generations and inherit and carry it forward? It is the common goal of Zhejiang people to strive for. Moreover, Zhejiang people have always had no sense of closure, and the teachings of masters and famous Confucian scholars have often been widely spread to other places. Examining the way of cultivating oneself and others, how can Zhejiang people revive their academic style, and how can our countrymen jointly draw on the good style of Zhejiang and further purify it, and change the trend of the whole country to a healthy state, which should be the important mission of this meeting.</p>
<p>Third, sort out the local literature. The idea of respecting and congratulating the mulberry and zither and engaging in the collection and promotion of local literature has been well-known in Zhejiang for a long time. Song Confucian Wang Shenning's Siming Literature Collection can be a prominent example. After the middle of the Qing Dynasty, the style of compiling and publishing the works of the local sages as a series was also unique to Zhejiang Province. Successive people have continued to this day. (The Taizhou Series was the first, and in recent years there have been the Xianju Series, the Chuzhou Series, and the Siming Series, which is even more grandiose in scale and is being continued.) Looking back on the past, the superiors were not as diligent in advocating as the sages of the past. The private property of the individual is less than that of the ancient times. Therefore, the writings of the sages are gradually lost, and the ancient monuments and scenic spots are also lacking in sorting. Even the general history of a province has been missing for two hundred years; the compilation of the epigraphy has not been heard to have continued the tradition of Ruan Wenda. We can see from the inscriptions on the cultural relics on display in this exhibition that the literature of a place is easily lost. Therefore, all the work of literature collation, such as the repair of ancestral halls and tombs, the preservation of epigraphy, and even the re-editing of the county chronicles and provincial chronicles, and the preservation of Pingzhi materials, should be done by the standing bureaus of the provinces and counties and the people of the local area with a heart. The province will take the lead in the area, even in today's world of honoring shame and cultivating martial arts, it is believed that the construction of the Confucius Temple, the creation of the Stele Forest, and the planning and construction of the general history are all closely related to the importance of political education, and should be planned early and not delayed.</p>
<p>Fourth, promote the spirit of patriotism and love for the country. Loving the hometown and loving the country are the same source, and they are related to each other, and there is no prejudice. The people of Zhejiang are sincere in their hometowns, and the humanities of Zhejiang are the most closely related to the safety and survival of the nation. Tracing back to ancient times, Gou Jian's determination to rejuvenate the country was the first to establish a model. Later, the Eastern Jin Dynasty was in a state of partial security, and the two Xie used a battle to protect the overall situation; the capital of Lin'an was settled, and Zong Zhongjian (Ze) used the garrison to resist the enemy's atmosphere. In the Ming Dynasty, there were Song Lian and Liu (Ji) who assisted in the creation of the emperor's career, and Yu Zhongsu who stabilized the country. During the Ming Dynasty, the loyal and martyrs of Zhejiang rose up, Ningbo Qian Zhongjie (Sule), Zhang Cangshui (Huangyan), and Dongyang Zhang Yusi (Guowei) were the most prominent. In the Qing Dynasty's revolutionary campaign, Ke Fengfu made great contributions, and many of the elites of Zhejiang gave their lives to achieve benevolence, or assisted in their success with words. This exhibition, Zhou Yuan Zizhu, Jiangguan solicited, and paid special attention to the literature related to the expression of the past philosophers and the guidance of the people's spirit; all the martyrs of the revolution and the sages of Zhejiang who have contributed to the nation have tried their best to seek their portraits, writings, and objects. The purpose of the exhibition is not only to promote the figures of a province, but also to show this great and magnificent atmosphere, so that the people of Zhejiang and even the patriots of the whole country will rise up when they hear the news. It is good that the national fortune is difficult at this time, and foreign insults are very difficult. This spirit of loving the hometown and defending the country should be possessed by the people of the country. We hope that the viewers will examine it carefully and deeply in order to achieve the effect of learning from the past and planning for the future, and not just be fascinated by the past with the scattered vermilion and ink, and avoid being criticized for playing with things and losing ambition.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the exhibitions in our country in modern times are nothing more than three types: or they list cultural relics to examine academic studies; or they seek out products to encourage practical industries; or they only display calligraphy and paintings for people to appreciate. The famous cities and large cities in the south, in order to meet the needs of the times, attach great importance to the second, while Hangzhou is more beautiful and respects literature, and there are more calligraphy and painting exhibitions. As for the cultural relics exhibitions with academic significance, the old capital has always been regarded as the most prominent. This exhibition of the Zhejiang Museum intends to promote the academic style in addition to elaborating on the literature of Zhejiang Province. Even if it fails to achieve the effect of changing the atmosphere, it also wants to try its initial scaffold for a wider cultural relic exhibition. During the solicitation, collection branches were set up in the nine special areas of the province and in Nanjing, Beiping, and Shanghai. There were also local sages who were kind and good to me and lent many treasures. The main points were that the productions of Zhejiang people or those related to Zhejiang were returned. The special heads and county heads of the provinces, the local elders, and the academic institutions and scholars outside the province provided various kinds of assistance, which is deeply appreciated. If this meeting can be roughly impressive and slightly effective, it is all thanks to the protection of the public. As for the improper display and the mistakes in the examination and compilation, the colleagues of the Zhejiang Museum should apologize to the visitors and ask for their correction.

<h3>The Relationship between Zhejiang Literature and Modern China</h3>
<p>— Liu Yizheng</p>
<p>In modern China, the literature of Zhejiang has the greatest relationship. The Mongolians were barren and the Ming Dynasty rose up. Although the Zhu family started in Haosi, they planned brightly and created the Xia Dynasty. The strength of the public officials of Yiwu, Jinhua, and Qingtian also contributed. The learning system of Min declined after its peak. Yangming changed its banner and became the patriarch of a generation. Lishan and Lizhou did not replace it, and the flow spread to the neighboring areas. The light and spirit of Zhejiang to China and Asia is so great. The Manchu Qing painfully eradicated the Zhejiang scholars, and the Zhejiang scholars huddled in the lewd power. The literary writings increasingly portrayed their spirituality, and the thoughts of the bereaved people for the country and the nation were hidden. The knives and saws killed people, and the feathers and benefits could not destroy and corrupt them. Shanyin and Yuhang, ordinary people, were able to take advantage of Changbai's disadvantages and donate their lives to overturn their tripods. The extreme of Yunhui caused a turmoil for 20 years. From the broken mountains and rivers, they held the literature, industry, party rule, and military power, and ran around to control the world. Only the heroes of Zhejiang did it. Alas, the people of Zhejiang have shouldered China for five or six hundred years, and what is expressed by the side of Zhejiang's literature is also the Taoist. The difficult times are coming, and the chariots are coming. I hope that those who view this meeting will hold my words as needles and fruits, and expand the ambitions of the former philosophers. With my China and Asia, the influence of this meeting is not only limited to one province and one place.</p>
<p>It is too late to plan to attach the special issue of the Literature Exhibition to the Daily News, and the solicitation of articles is allowed to be hasty. Mr. Liu Yimou of Dantu replied that because the time was short, he did not write a special article, but answered his request with a title. In order to facilitate the readers, he proposed a title based on the meaning of the text. I hope Mr. Liu and the readers will understand.</p>
<h3>Essential Description of Precious Items in the Zhejiang Literature Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Cha Ke</p>
<p>Although the Zhejiang Province's Literature Exhibition has been affected by the current situation, thanks to the enthusiastic support of public and private collectors from various regions, the exhibition is filled with a dazzling array of precious items. Unfortunately, due to the hurried timeframe, the arrival of items from different locations varied, and the procedures for inspection, registration, review, and classification were extremely cumbersome, preventing the compilation of a complete catalog for visitors. Here, we will briefly introduce some of the notable items that have been recorded, providing a glimpse of the collection.</p>
<p>The scope of the collection covers both the north and south, with the majority of submissions coming from within the province. As of October 26th, over 20,000 items, comprising more than 6,000 different types, have been received, with over half having been selected. Among them, noteworthy items include: (1) Manuscripts of local worthies, such as Ming Dynasty Shanyin resident Zhang Dai's manuscript "Stone Cabinet Book" (believed to have been plagiarized by Gu Yingtai) and "Tao'an Manuscripts"; Chen Hongshou of Zhuji's handwritten first draft of "Lun Tang Collection"; Wu Yanku'ang of Yongjia's "Flower History"; Wang Yizhong of Qingtian's "Record of Suppressing Bandits"; and manuscripts such as Qi Zhaonan of Tiantai's "Yuzhi Hall Collection of Writings", Sun Yirang of Rui'an's "Original Manuscripts of Names and Origins," Huang Yizhou of Dinghai's "Original Manuscripts of Jing Ji Miscellaneous Works," and Zhang Binglin of Yu Hang's "Qu Shu" manuscript. (2) Collated Editions, such as Qian Taiji of Jiaxing's hand-copied and collated "Laozi's Daodejing," and Sun Yirang of Rui'an's collated "General Explanation of Rites." (3) Manuscript Copies, such as Xu Wei's handwritten collection of essays and Cha Chubo's handwritten poems from the Ming and Qing dynasties, respectively, are considered treasures of the book world. (4) There are many rare portraits of local worthies, including an image of Qian Wusu Wang of Wuyue, a painting of Yang Ci Hu from the Song Dynasty (painted in the late Ming), a painting of Liu Wencheng Giving Lessons for Generations (painted by Chen Laolian), a portrait of seven generations of Wang Wencheng Gong, a portrait of Fan Dongming (Qin), portraits of Mao Xihe and Quan Xieshan from the Qing Dynasty, and a portrait of Xihe and Zhu Zhuzhai (painted by Ding Xiaoya with inscriptions by Ji Yun, Cheng Jin, Qian Daxin, etc.), and portraits of Zhang Cangshui and Qian Zhongjie. There are also numerous large photographs of other portraits, numbering in the hundreds. (5) Relics of local worthies are the most difficult to collect, due to the lack of attention given to them by the Chinese people and the high regard shown by collectors. However, items collected include Qian Wusu Wang's Tian Ce Tang precious jade seal, Yuan Dynasty Plum Blossom Taoist Wu Zhonggui's inkstone, Wang Huaibin's court tablet from Yunhe in the Ming Dynasty, Zheng Xiao's iron helmet used during the defense against Japanese pirates in Haiyan, Zhang Cangshui's inkstone (collected by the Yang family of Cixi, very precious), Leqing Heshan Renbai's inkstone, Chen Guifen of Tiantai's champion armor from the Qing Dynasty, and Zhang Shuwei's inscription on Qin measuring devices from Jiaxing. Among them, relics of revolutionary martyrs, along with their writings, are displayed in a separate section dedicated to (6) National Revolution Literature (limited to people from Zhejiang). Due to the difficulty of collecting these items, the collection is limited. However, items such as the Guangfuhui history written in pencil by Tao Huanqing, leader of the Guangfuhui, three days before his martyrdom, Ao Mengjiang of Jiaxing's secret propaganda material "Ancestor Worship and Blessing Book" and prayers, and Xu Bosun of Shanyin's early drawing of the Chinese coastal map, are rarely seen by the Chinese people. These are unlike the writings of Qiu Jin and portraits of martyrs from Shanyin, which have been exhibited in the province before. Chen Yingshi's blood-stained clothes, cherished by the Lake Society, are rarely displayed to the public. This time, through the efforts of the association, it was possible to bring them for public viewing, complementing the bronze statue on the lake. (7) The selected collection of over 500 scrolls of calligraphy and paintings by local worthies is exceptionally beautiful. Notable works include Wu Zhen's imitation of Mi Fu's landscape painting from the Yuan Dynasty, Ren Daoxun of Rui'an's hanging scroll of landscape painting from the Ming Dynasty, Chen Laolian's "Reading in the Creek and Mountain" painting, Mao Xihe's vertical scroll of "Jade Long Stone", and Dai Wenjie Gong's bamboo painting from Qiantang. Countless other masterpieces are also on display. A book by Xia Gui of Song Dynasty Qiantang is included, but its authenticity is questionable. As for Yue Zhongwu's authentic writing and Ge Xiaoxian's handwritten letter from Linhai, they are not yet counted among the works of ten thousand worthies. Other (8) printed books include the "Ksitigarbha Dharani Sutra" printed during the Later Zhou dynasty, discovered at Tianning Temple in Huzhou (20 years earlier than the scripture rolls from the Leifeng Pagoda), Song Dynasty supervised editions, Chen Jie Yuan's bookshop editions, Yuan Dynasty West Lake Academy editions, and fine prints from Zhejiang during the Ming and Qing dynasties, providing a view of the history of printing in Zhejiang. (9) Collections of books, including editions from Fan's Tianyige, Qi's Danshengtang from the Ming Dynasty, Zhu's Qiancaitang, Bao's Zhibuzu Zhai from the Qing Dynasty, and Ding's Baqian Juan Lou, and Sun's Yuhai Lou, have been selected for display. Rare items include Yan Jiuneng's inscription on Zhou Yigong's manuscript from the Song Dynasty, and Wu Meicun's hand-copied "Collection of Mr. Zhou from Linpu" from Qiancaitang, which are considered treasures of the book world. (10) Election documents, including a large number of Ming and Qing provincial examination records, the Ming Dynasty examination lists from Ningbo Tianyige, and other important documents have been collected. The most eye-catching items include the original marked examination papers of Qi Chengcan and Qi Biaojia, father and son from Ming Dynasty Shanyin, and the silver cup used by Zhang Wei Chi of Xiaochu Haiyan from Zhang's Sheyuan at Ma Mingzhi's banquet (also listed as relics of local worthies), and the court attire and palace examination papers of Chen Shengqin from Qing Dynasty Tiantai. (11) Very few official documents have been collected, but items such as the memorial submitted by Grand Secretary Hu Zhaolong during the Shunzhi period of the Qing Dynasty, accusing Zhang Dajie of bribing Jinshi Shen of Huzhou, and the report by Zhejiang Governor Ruan Yuan in the 14th year of Jiaqing, as well as the final draft of the Yang Naiwu case preserved by Yu Hang County, are valuable. (12) The collection of Zhejiang local chronicles is very rich, including Song Dynasty editions of Siming Zhi and Chicheng Zhi, as well as Ming and Qing Dynasty chronicles. In addition to the items collected by the Zhejiang Library over the past 30 years, treasures from Tianyige, Jiaye Lou, Jiufeng's old collection, the Peking Library, Jinling University, and other private collections have been brought together, creating a grand spectacle. (13) The charts include forty new Zhejiang historical and geographical maps, as well as old Zhejiang maps from the Ming and Qing dynasties borrowed from the Huaping Library, which are well-prepared. Various economic and transportation maps sent by construction organizations are not included. (14) The genealogy section includes genealogies from prominent families in various regions of the province during the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Zhejiang Library already had a collection, and local borrowing has added to the display. Among them, the Song Dynasty genealogy treasured by the Chen family of Fengqiao, Zhuji, is considered particularly valuable. The beginning of the genealogy includes Emperor Gaozong's inscription from the 15th year of Shaoxing, portraits of Chen Shengbi, Chen Yaozu, Yaozi, and others, and the "Seal of the Imperial Song Dynasty." It is said that there are many old genealogies from the Song and Yuan dynasties that have been passed down, but this is the only one that has been generously loaned to the association for display, making it a rare and difficult to see masterpiece. (15) There are very few original gold and stone artifacts on display, but the Wu Yue gold-plated pagoda and Tang Dynasty stone scripture pillar are quite precious. The rubbings, including those collected by the Zhejiang Library over the years and those sent from various parties, are numerous. Among them, in addition to Yitaku rubbings, there are also old items from the Tang and Song dynasties. (16) There are not many steles and inscriptions on display, but there is a Dongyang version of the Lanting Collection. The Luoshen Fu written by Wang Youjun and rubbed on Southern Tang Chenxintang paper, provided by Mr. Sun Shefu, was once owned by the Qing Imperial Court, and the Zhu Zhang spots can be traced. Although it does not have a special connection with Zhejiang literature, it is a treasure of this art form. The collection of cultural relics is vast, and the arrangement of the manuscripts is not yet complete. This hasty compilation may contain omissions and inaccuracies. We hope to provide a detailed account after further investigation in the future. (Editor's note: The catalog and inscriptions of this exhibition will be published in the "Wenlan Journal" Volume 2, Issues 2 and 4, a special exhibition edition published by the Zhejiang Library.)</p>
<h3>Editor's Notice</h3>
<p>For the special issue of the Zhejiang Literature Exhibition, the Zhejiang Library sent letters in advance to solicit contributions or poems and inscriptions from scholars inside and outside the province. We are deeply grateful for the generous contributions from various sectors. However, due to the limited space available for special issues in various newspapers, in addition to those published in the Shen Bao (Day 1), Southeast Daily (Day 2), Ta Kung Pao (Day 3), and Zheng Bao (Day 1, separately), (most of which are not repeated, please pay attention), many others could not be published due to space constraints. For example, Mr. Zhu Shijia's "Study of the Three Records of Lin'an," Mr. Qian Baozong's "Record of Zhejiang Astronomers," Mr. Jiang Fucong's "Study of Seals of Zhejiang Book Collectors," Mr. Qian Nanyang's "Drama of Zhejiang," and Mr. Chen Yiyang's "Study of the Qian Family's Iron Certificate" could not be published due to their length and the small size of the newspaper. At the beginning of the solicitation, it was stated that a special issue would be published in the "Wenlan Journal," and all the articles are in-depth studies and will be published in the "Wenlan Journal." The "Guofeng Monthly" also plans to publish a special issue on Zhejiang literature, and some articles may also be included in that publication for broader readership. We hope that the authors will understand.</p>

<h3>Letter to Readers</h3>
<p>— Shi Ying</p>
<p>Preface to "Stories of National Crisis"</p>
<p>My dear readers:</p>
<p>I often want to understand this: Why has our country reached this state? The danger of extinction is already before our eyes, some of our brothers have already become slaves of others, and some are about to be chained. Is it really as our elders and teachers say, that we Chinese are destined to suffer? I do not believe it. I searched for books and read many history books; these books have various different records. They tell me that our country once had glorious times, and had many things to be proud of. But since the big foreign bosses came to China to do business, they called China worse than each day. The national power of China has fallen from strong to its current state of decline in less than a hundred years. - These records in the books finally satisfied me. But I spent a long time searching for these things, reading several feet thick of books; I think that every Chinese person now has a question like mine, and must understand this, but not everyone has the time to do it like I do. I want to tell what I know, so that everyone knows. But my writing is very poor, I can't be like the gentlemen who wear square hats, doing it originally and deeply like lecture notes in university; or write exciting and impassioned articles with beautiful words. Fortunately, my readers are always afraid of headaches when reading lecture notes in school, and are afraid that exciting and impassioned articles are too empty and they get nothing. Let me write it in the most common words, like an old man in the countryside. I will not say any professional terms, I am not afraid of someone saying my things are crude and not like articles. I just write according to my meaning, and do my best to write clearly and understandably, so that readers can read on.</p>
<p>I am reluctant to mention many trivial names in my book. The reason why these people are able to leave their names in history is mostly not their own fault. What we need to know is all of us, our country, why we have come to this point. As for the big men, we don’t have to memorize their names; most of them rarely do us any good except for planning for themselves. My readers only need to know a few names, and that's enough. As for place names and other specialized terms in the book, I also use as few as possible, so as not to bother readers with these words. Therefore, my book is even less like a lecture in school. But after reading my book, if you can understand the situation of China being oppressed by the great powers in the past hundred years, then my goal will be achieved.</p>
<p>The name of my book is Stories of National Crisis. At first I wanted to use the name "Stories of the Oppression of China by the Great Powers in the Past Hundred Years", but what is very problematic is the three words "past hundred years". History is not a "magic lantern", watching one picture after another; history is a very long river, flowing from its source to the ocean, completely a long one, and cannot be divided into sections. The river water and sea water pass by wave after wave, and history also has the past, then the present, and the future. It is impossible to specify that on what year, what month, and what day, ancient times suddenly became modern times, and everything in the world was replaced. The stories I wrote in this book started from the Opium War; it is not to say that in 1840, the British suddenly had a whim to come to China to find fun, and then the Opium War broke out. Many past reasons have already determined the occurrence of the Opium War. But I have no choice; in order to save many trivial words, I had to cut the Gordian knot, abandon the past and not talk about it, and start by saying the Opium War. Because the current situation in China is completely caused by the events of the past sixty or seventy years, this book specifically explains the first few things in more detail; recent events, readers have heard and seen, and probably have some impressions left in their minds, so I will explain them more simply. However, I am not a tape recorder; it is not enough to simply report some news from the newspaper, what I talk about is naturally more systematic.</p>
<p>I am not a historian, and I don't have many books on hand, so mistakes in this book are inevitable; but I already want to thank my friends, they lent me valuable books to consult; I am not a writer, my book cannot be written vividly, so that readers feel as if they have personally experienced it, that is certain. Jun Lian was the first person to read this book. She has not attended a deep school, and she knows less about everything academic than I do. I had her read what I had written first, to see if she could understand everything. If she can't understand, then this passage has been tainted with a bit of civility, and I have to change it. I always go in the direction of being the easiest to understand.</p>
<p>I am waiting for readers to criticize after reading, and I hope my readers are willing to tell me. Finally, I would also like to thank the gentlemen in the Editorial and Translation Department of Kaiming Bookstore, because they gave me a lot of valuable instructions.</p>
<h3>Further Explanation for Sha Meijun's Review of the Junior High School Singing Textbook</h3>
<p>— Wu Mengfei</p>
<p>A book review cut from the Shanghai "Li Bao" on October 26th was forwarded by a friend, commenting on the "Junior High School Singing Textbook" that I edited. In addition to expressing gratitude to the reviewer, Sha Meijun, the editor really has a few words to declare:</p>
<p>The original review said: "Among them, except for the "Man Jiang Hong", "Youth Life", and "Tian Feng" songs, the rest are foreign tunes filled with Chinese words." In fact, "Tian Feng" is also a foreign tune, and the reviewer does not know its source. As for "Youth Life", although it is a domestic melody, the lyrics have been changed by the editor.</p>
<p>The original review also said: "Translating the lyrics of foreign songs into Chinese does not lose the original tune's mood. However, filling foreign tunes with Chinese words at will, regardless of whether they are suitable or not, as long as the number of words in the Chinese words can fit into the tune, is simply unreasonable." The editor also deeply sympathizes with this view, but it cannot be generalized. I often see that many of the foreign lyrics translated directly by the general public cannot be integrated with the original tune; and generally, the hymns sung by churches that are translated from foreign lyrics into Chinese are even grammatically incorrect, not to mention the rhyme. Does the reviewer think that such songs do not lose their original mood? As for taking foreign tunes and filling them with lyrics at will, it is certainly not feasible, but if you can match lyrics that are mutually integrated, it is not necessarily undesirable, and there is no need to match lyrics that praise something just because the original tune praises God. Originally. The expression of vocal music often relies on the meaning of the lyrics, and if the lyrics are erased, the listener can only feel a vague mood, so composers often mark the beginning of the song with words that indicate various musical interests, such as majestic, beautiful, cheerful, sad, etc. (all using professional musical terms). The person filling in the lyrics only needs to determine the rhythm of the original tune and not go against the meaning of the whole song. If, in addition to taking care of the mood of the song, it is necessary to seek complete identity in the meaning of the words, and then think that they are as unrelated as horses and oxen, I am afraid it is too rigid and outdated.</p>
<p>The three songs listed by the reviewer, "Missing Hometown", "Fearless Spirit", and "Abolish Unequal Treaties", were all selected by the editor from other publications, so the names of the composers and lyricists are marked on each song to clarify responsibility. Didn't the reviewer see this? However, the reason why the editor chose these three songs is of course because he thought that the three songs were generally still usable - except for a small part of the lyrics that are slightly criticizeable. The mood of "Missing Hometown" is expressive (Expressivo), the mood of "Fearless Spirit" tends to be beautiful, and the mood of "Abolish Unequal Treaties" is brave, which can generally be consistent with the Chinese lyrics. Does Sha Meijun think that if the original tune is about love, the filled lyrics must also be about love to match the mood? Then: I want to ask you to look up the foreign-published "Songs the Whole World Sings", which selects two original tunes for "Fearless Spirit": one is titled Believe me if all those Ende-aring Young Charms, and the other is titled Fair Harvard. It can be seen that foreigners are also using one tune for two purposes? Also, the original tune of "Abolish Unequal Treaties" is of course from Wagner's opera, but foreigners also match it with Flag of the free lyrics and sing it! (See foreign-published books such as "Songs the Children Love to Sing"). Will the reviewer laugh so hard that he can't close his mouth when he sees foreigners match the "Wedding March" with the lyrics of "Flag of Freedom"?</p>
<p>All in all: Our country's current music teaching materials are very poor. Ideally, it is best to create some songs with very appropriate and inseparable words and tunes. The editor is also trying and has already published them separately; as for using foreign tunes to fill in Chinese lyrics, it is a measure of expediency when one's own creation may not necessarily be better than the works of foreign musicians. Has the reviewer seen the "Collection of Music Teaching Materials for Middle Schools" and the "Collection of Music Teaching Materials for Elementary Schools" compiled by our Ministry of Education? Among them, a lot of time and procedures were spent collecting songs from all parts of the country, but the result is that most of them are foreign tunes filled with Chinese lyrics. Although my "Junior High School Singing Textbook" does not dare to claim to be a perfect work, it strives to avoid songs that are about spring flowers and autumn moons, and love and pity, and have no moaning, and there is absolutely no feeling of decadence and sadness, which is gratifying. It is difficult to be an editor, and it is not easy to review books. What does Sha Meijun think?</p>
<h3>Needle for Youth Cultivation</h3>
<p>— Zheng</p>
<p>"Continuation of Love's Education" - by Edmondo De Amicis - Translated by Xia Mianzun</p>
<p>Published by Kaiming Bookstore - Six Corners</p>
<p>I remember when I first left middle school and went to work as a trainee in a factory, I always felt dissatisfied with the work at hand. I either thought it was too mechanical or felt it was dull and tedious. At that time, I had read a few books bought from the market about professional self-cultivation, but most of what they talked about were grand principles such as "Suffering hardship is the price of success." On the one hand, I felt that I had not suffered "hardship," so of course, I didn't want to aspire to be "superior." On the other hand, I had always suspected that these old sayings were the idle talk of people who had already climbed to the top, and I was unwilling to accept them. It wasn't until later that I accidentally bought this book, "Continuation of Love's Education," and after its faithful and sincere explanation, it suddenly opened up my previous mood, and a bright and ideal path of life was clearly displayed before my eyes. I began to have hope, aspiration, and joy. Those monotonous tasks not only no longer bored me, but I also had great purpose in them.</p>
<p>How could this book have such great power? Because it can tell us, in a kind and thorough explanation, the attitude we should have towards "being a person;" it makes us know how to deal with the environment around us, and how to extract rich knowledge and proper fun from the things we encounter and hear every day. The old saying "Suffering hardship is the price of success" often makes us feel bitter even about things that are not bitter, but this book clearly tells us that there is no "bitter" word to be found in any legitimate career, just as there is no "difficult" word to be found in Napoleon's dictionary.</p>
<p>This book is written entirely in the style of a novel. It begins by saying that Enrico, the protagonist of "Love's Education," became seriously ill after entering middle school because he worked too hard. After recovering from his illness, he was sent by his parents to his uncle's house by the sea to recuperate. The uncle is an old man with gray hair, strong and gentle, like a "kind lion." He has pure but not extravagant hopes for Enrico and wants to educate him into a healthy Italian citizen with sea-like passion. Most of the book is the old man's "sea beast's roar" like teachings, and the other part is his actions in a few months and Enrico's being influenced, as well as a few moving stories worth remembering.</p>
<p>Now, let's first take a look at what kind of person the uncle in the book is:</p>
<p>The uncle's chest is full of rich knowledge, but his knowledge is different from others. Other people's knowledge comes from books, but he "never received any education from anyone since he was a child, but used his own eyes to see and his own heart to think." He said, "There is a world that school teachers and school textbooks cannot teach. You must learn about this world yourself." "Studying the vast nature and living world is more important than schoolwork." "No matter what corner of nature, or who you meet on the road, can become your living knowledge... Nature is the mother of wisdom, the teacher's teacher." He lost his father at the age of ten, dropped out of school, and went to live a life at sea; later, he became a captain, but what is most gratifying is that he actually learned a sea-like great personality and sea-like rich knowledge. Why did he have such success? Please see the precious teachings of a pastor to him:</p>
<p>"Don't be discouraged. Even if you are a sailor, you can still hope to become a captain. As long as you have ambition, you can become any famous person... No occupation is shameful..."</p>
<p>"Starting tomorrow, please swear every morning that you must do three good things in a day. When you go to bed at night, please reflect on whether you have actually done the three good things you planned to do today. If you do this, your life will not be wasted for a day. As long as you can do this, you don't need to go to school anymore, and you don't need to wait for the teacher's teaching." How did he implement these teachings?</p>
<p>"...He works hard every day: first, to improve his health, second, to improve his heart, and third, to cultivate his thoughts. He does this until he is old, without interruption.</p>
<p>His personality cultivation is indeed the greatest success in his life:</p>
<p>First, although his appearance is like a barbarian, his heart is full of correct "love." He not only loves his friends and relatives in his memory, loves his country, but also loves all people universally. For the sake of love, sometimes he is very strict, sometimes he becomes very gentle, and sometimes he is very brave. When we read "Dog and Man," about his rescue of the child who was bitten by a dog, everyone cannot help but respect him! When we read "Pork Buns and Tragic Memories," about how he used straightforward friendship to transform a treacherous Brospi into such a tame person, everyone cannot help but shed a few tears of joy! His love is sometimes not only applied to human beings but also to plants and trees. This is easily seen in "Plants and Trees That Understand Words." He said, "Trees, like me, can feel, can be happy, can endure, and, alas! They, like me, will also die!" How kind these words are!</p>
<p>Second, his artistic cultivation is very profound. He likes the fierce ocean, and he also likes the earth, the mother of life. His heart is full of beautiful poems. He once said, "People should all be poets. People rely on hope, some become farmers, some become fishermen, some become factory workers, some become sailors, and some become mechanics. But no matter what occupation they are engaged in, if their hearts are not the hearts of poets, they cannot bloom beautiful flowers of life." But what is the poetry he is talking about? It is not empty praise, nor is it gratuitous sadness. It is the crystallization of hot blood and soul, the smile of struggle and victory. He believes that the light of Italy is all a gift from the great poet Dante. Therefore, he believes that poetry can save the country, as long as it is done in this way: "Don't be discouraged in everything, hold hope, and move forward actively and bravely. If you encounter difficulties, always regard them as a precursor to new victories and expect them in the future, and, in just things, you must be a hero. In order to show the spirit of beauty, you should not fear anything."</p>
<p>Third, he is upright, decisive, and full of responsibility. He does things without hesitation, is generous, organized, and has insight. He helps the mad beggar but is not fooled by false philanthropists. When he lost the borrowed counterfeit gold coins in his childhood, he immediately used all the money in his pocket to buy real ones to compensate. He despises money and vanity. He is willing to help others with all his strength, but he does not want people to exchange for false gifts.</p>
<p>In such a thin book, this old great man has fully entrusted all these great cultivations that he has painstakingly pondered. What he wants to teach and influence is not only his nephew Enrico, but the entire Italian nation, not only the entire Italian nation, but all of humanity. His greatest contribution is to point out a bright path in life for us. He tells us that we should seek precious and beautiful poetry from places that are usually not noticed. As long as we bravely enjoy, work, appreciate, and think about these beautiful poems, a great power will be born from these poems, and this power will enable you to break through all obstacles without pain, like sea waves, like the wind, like lightning forward!</p>
<p>In many places, in addition to feeling the author's superb thoughts, we cannot help but admire the beauty of his writing style. According to the preface, the author was originally an Italian poet, which is very credible; because the text of the entire book is almost everywhere as light, beautiful, and majestic as poetry. Some of the descriptions cannot be written by ordinary novelists. Please see the following paragraphs:</p>
<p>The uncle's physique is strong, although not very slender, with broad shoulders, all gray hair, heavy beard, clear eyebrows, and with a slight frown, you can hardly see his eyes under the long eyebrows.</p>
<p>The uncle's eyes are really strange. The light like gazing at the angry tide and the soft light are always shining alternately.</p>
<p>The uncle is impatient and often gets angry, but once the thunder passes, it is over, and he is very gentle afterward.</p>
<p>The uncle's color is tanned like red copper. His face is engraved with deep, gully-like wrinkles. At first glance, he seems terrible. But on closer inspection, he is full of kindness in his strength, like an old, kind lion. —Page 10—</p>
<p>The child wore a sleeveless white flannel shirt, revealing a small head and shoulders like spring flowers from the thin gauze collar. Its atmosphere is so clear, pure, and clean, like the morning sun, almost making people imagine the dawn of a new era. —Page 74—</p>
<p>Finally, I, like the translator Mr. Xia Mianzun, "hope that tens of millions of young people in the country who are not fortunate enough to go to school can get a kind of comfort from this book and develop a kind of courageous self-confidence!"</p>

In the early morning, overseas telegrams reported that London bulk transactions, both near and far, contracted by 1.25. The New York silver market did not move.

After the opening, the Japanese bank slightly sold Donghui. Banks also supplied more than was demanded. The exchange rates announced by HSBC Bank were flat for both England and the United States, but the process was still stable. The silver balance tax was announced to contract by 0.75. Although the Xinfeng Foreign Company slightly sold near-term American dollars, the banks also operated concurrently with the demand, so the general trend showed a fluctuation. The noon closing price for the near term was 1 shilling 2.5 pence for the English exchange rate and 29.5 yuan and 5.625 for the American exchange rate, which was flat compared to the previous closing. The same was true for the far term. Chinese merchants continued to sell 100,000 yuan of American dollars. The record of transactions is listed below.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Spot Sales Stalled, November Yarn Even Weaker</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rebounded in the afternoon, but the trend was mediocre. The November contract alone fell, because previously there was a consensus that absorbing the November contract would be bullish, but after a large number of orders from customers showed no improvement, it temporarily stalled, so the reaction was particularly strong. Distant-term dealers were still bullish, which was more firm and expensive, it is said.</p>
<p>The Decline in the Forward Yarn Market is Moderate</p>
<p>The opening of the benchmark yarn market was lower in each month, and the momentum was weak. Because spot yarn sales stalled, morale was depressed, and many speculative positions were liquidated, but most people were optimistic, so the decline was moderate. By the time of the third closing, it was heard that the Osaka Sanpin yarn price for the near month had risen sharply by 5.6 yuan, and sentiment was firm. As a result, the near month fell by 1.34 yuan from the previous day's closing price, and the distant month fell by 0.69 yuan. After the afternoon opening, the momentum of the current month was still weak, and selling pressure increased, falling by 0.8 yuan. The distant month was still flat. After the second session, dealers in the distant month still tended to buy and were firm. As a result, each month rose by 0.57 yuan from the morning closing price, but the current month fell by 0.6 yuan. It was found that Dafeng sold 3,200 bales, Yiji 2,000 bales, Zhenda 1,000 bales, Gengfeng 1,150 bales, Huamao 1,350 bales, Changyu 900 bales, Runkang 950 bales, Yongchang 950 bales, Xincheng 750 bales, Yuda 1,150 bales, Xingchang 750 bales, and Dachang 700 bales. Hengyi bought 1,650 bales, Jinchang 2,450 bales, Hexing 2,850 bales, Minghua 650 bales, Yongda 650 bales, Shengyuan 950 bales, Fengtai 1,000 bales, and Jinkang 600 bales. The highest and lowest market prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Still Weak</p>
<p>It was found that the total number of bales bought by each gang throughout the day was 335 bales. The selling price fell by 3 yuan, and the thread fell by 4 yuan. The amount of purchases by each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Inland: 265 Guangdong: 60 Jiangxi: 10</p>
<h3>Congestion of Arrivals from All Routes, Near-Term Cotton Enters 40 Yuan Mark - Foreign Firms Also Dump -</h3>
<p>The cotton market fell sharply in the morning and rebounded slightly in the afternoon, but overseas cotton conditions were flat and weak. Cotton prices in Hankou, Zhengzhou, and other places fell, and arrivals from all routes gradually congested. Foreign firms also dumped, and the market price fell. In the afternoon, some profit-takers bought to settle, and the market rebounded slightly, it is said.</p>
<p>Benchmark Cotton Slightly Improved in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The pre-market opening of benchmark cotton was weak due to flat and weak overseas cotton. Sellers were active in the market. The near month fell sharply, breaking through the 40 yuan mark. The second session continued to fall, because Japanese firms also dumped, and the market was loose. By the time of the closing, there was a slight offset and the market rebounded. As a result, the near month fell by 0.67 yuan from the previous day's closing price, and the distant month fell by 0.35 yuan. The market situation after the afternoon opening was flat, and there were no major changes in the second and third sessions. Because spot cotton mills needed to be quiet and the source of supply from the north increased daily, a portion of profit-takers took profits by going short until the closing, and the market improved slightly. As a result, each month rose by 0.12 yuan from the morning closing price. It was found that Juxing sold 3,000 dan, Xingchang 2,400 dan, Zhenda 1,900 dan, Dafeng 3,900 dan, Huamao 3,500 dan, Shenji 3,700 dan, Renfeng 6,500 dan, Yuanyi 2,600 dan, Yichang 2,400 dan, Yongchang 2,000 dan, Tonghe 3,900 dan, Xincheng 3,100 dan, Yikang 2,900 dan, Yuanxingchang 11,200 dan, and Tongfeng 1,100 dan. Jinchang bought 6,100 dan, Hengyi 4,100 dan, Tongji 1,700 dan, Daqing 2,000 dan, Hexing 12,700 dan, Gengfeng 8,300 dan, Shenchang 2,300 dan, Fengtai 5,400 dan, Dachangcheng 10,300 dan, Runkang 3,700 dan, Xhengyuan 3,000 dan, and Xiecheng 2,600 dan. The highest and lowest market prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>The Needs of Spot Cotton Mills Still Feel Unsmooth</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is turning, and factory needs are not smooth. The source of Yao cotton is 2,890 bales, and the source of Tong cotton is 1,650 bales.</p>
<p>Dulisi 61.50, Dihua Factory entered 400 pieces. Spot delivery to the factory.</p>
<p>Hankou Fine Velvet 50.75, Donghua Factory entered 84 pieces. Same as above.</p>
<p>Shashi Cotton 51.50, also 100 pieces. Also same as above.</p>
<p>Ling Cotton 56.00, Sulun Factory entered 89 pieces. Also warehouse delivery.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Long Positions Largely Liquidated, Sanpin Yarn Price Surged by 5.8 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened, with each month ranging from unchanged to up 5 points. The market price showed no rise or fall in the early morning. Then dealers bought near-month contracts, and Liverpool bought distant-month contracts, and the market price rose. Unfortunately, hedging sales increased, and long positions were largely liquidated, and there was a reaction again. Cotton merchants waited for the election results and the next government report, and most of them remained on the sidelines. Although the spot cotton price was firm, demand was sluggish. Hayesd estimates this week's factory use to be 466,000 bales, and Liverpool's inventory to be 252,000 bales. The weather forecast for the East was good, with a slight frost, the Central region was warmer, and the West had clouds and rain. The closing was stable. The spot price fell by 6 points, and the futures price fell by 2 to 5 points. The spot price of English cotton fell by 2 points, and the futures price rose or fell by 1 or 2 points. Indian cotton was firm because rainfall in the Central Provinces was unfavorable for new cotton, and spot traders bought Oomra and were firm. Pingole rose by 0.75 rupees, Oomra rose by 0.25 to 0.75 rupees, and Baloqui fell by 0.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated the 30th).</p>
<p>Pingole 158.50, up 0.75, 29.30</p>
<p>March futures 158.50, 0.75, 29.30</p>
<p>Oomra 197.25, 0.75, 34.90</p>
<p>March futures 196.2, 0.25, 34.70</p>
<p>Baloqui 128.50, down 0.25, 40.00</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the forecast for the opening on the 31st was Baloqui at 218 rupees, down 0.5 rupees, Oomra at 197 rupees, down 0.25 rupees, and Pingole at 158 rupees, down 0.5 rupees.</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Osaka on the 31st, Sanpin futures yarn rose by 0.9 to 5.8 yuan. The near month was 231.1 yuan, and the distant month was 210.4 yuan. Cotton futures fell by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan. The near month was 65.1 yuan, and the distant month was 65.95 yuan.</p>
<h3>Special Security Deposits for Yarn Transactions Will be Refunded in Batches, Effective from November 2nd</h3>
<p>The trend in the standard yarn and cotton market of the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange has been more moderate recently, and the ups and downs are not as violent as before. The special security deposit for yarn and cotton will change its method and cancel a batch starting from November 2nd. It was found that for new transactions in November, 16 yuan will be collected per bale, and 8 yuan in cash will be additionally collected for each bale in December and beyond. For cotton, 6 yuan in cash will be additionally collected per dan in November, and 3 yuan in cash will be additionally collected for each dan in December and beyond. One party will be charged a storage fee. The special security deposit previously collected will be refunded at 8 yuan per bale of cotton yarn and 3 yuan per dan of cotton after November 2nd, it is said.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shanghai Silk Merchants Face Severe Shortage of Near-Term Cargo</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Yokohama silk market softened. The spot price fell by 17 yuan, and the futures price fell by 14 yuan. The price of Japanese-Chinese silk products continued to decline by 0.02. Therefore, overseas silk prices are no longer as strong as before. The Shanghai silk market was unable to accommodate this and, moreover, the near-term cargo was severely short, and only a few transactions took place. Mill silk and other varieties had better sales, and the price was quite stable, it is said.</p>
<h3>Needle-like and Eyebrow-like Green Tea Sold Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign firm tea market, European firms' dealers had already filled the purchase orders made by foreign telegrams last week. Since Saturday was only a half-day market, the market situation became even more desolate. Only Xiehe Jinlong and other firms bought more than 200 boxes of needle-like, show eyebrow, and precious eyebrow green tea in the entire city.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Tea Warehouse Industry Association, after the green tea market started to move at the end of last week, the market situation developed immediately. This week, each foreign firm has been negotiating on each tea at market prices that are already in line with foreign prices. Transactions have been made for each tea. It is estimated that 1,850 boxes of precious eyebrow tea from all routes, 1,600 boxes of small needle-like eyebrow tea, 1,860 boxes of Pingshui pearl tea, 1,600 boxes of Gongxi tea from all routes, and about 1,000 boxes of Pingshui precious eyebrow tea were transacted. Other teas such as Phoenix eyebrow, shrimp eyebrow, and Pingshui No. 2 and 3 pearl tea also had hundreds of boxes transacted. It was found that the inventory of each tea has gradually decreased, and the market situation is also stable.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: After the Sharp Fall of Fourth Mill Estate Feather Yarn, etc., Low-Grade Goods from Our Factory Have All Retreated</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market saw a slightly larger volume of Japanese-made fine cloth and fine twill transactions due to the handling of the month-end goods sample mortgage slip procedures. The volume of Chinese-made goods was very small. However, the amount of overdue futures that had not yet been settled for fine cloth, fine twill, straight tribute cloth, serge, broadcloth, floral velvet, and diagonal velvet, etc., was also huge, all of which had to be delivered upon arrival. The market was flat yesterday, and business in all sectors remained sluggish. The selling prices of various goods also uniformly declined. Fine cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, and coarse twill fell by about a dime (per piece). In particular, the rebound of heavyweight coarse cloth was the most severe, with some mills falling by two dimes (per piece). About 200 pieces in total of 16-pound and 14-pound military uniforms were transacted. After the sharp fall of third mill estate goods, raw silk, etc., by about three dollars, low-grade goods from our factory, such as Xinhua Xinliao Tu, Gongsheng Pioneer Brand, Dafeng Caishen Brand, and Yuantong Da Deli Brand, all rebounded, falling by three to five dimes per piece. Printed straight tribute cloth and serge from various factories such as Hengfeng's internal and external factories, as well as straight tribute cloth, broadcloth, melton, and serge from various factories, all fell by about five li (per yard). However, most factories are still holding firm because they have undelivered orders and no inventory accumulation, so they are temporarily resisting loosening prices.

<p>Children's Special</p>
<h3>Statistics: Tung Oil Trade in September – Limited Progress in European and American Markets, Stagnant Conditions in Shanghai and Hankou</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, Shanghai's tung oil exports in September totaled 3,839 metric tons, a decrease of 2,777 metric tons compared to the 6,616 metric tons in the same month last year. The total for the first nine months of this year was 78,798 metric tons, a decrease of 27,822 metric tons compared to the 106,620 metric tons in the same period last year. Further investigation shows that Hankou's export volume this month totaled 28,623 metric tons, an increase of 7,779 metric tons compared to the same month last year. The total for the first nine months of this year was 353,460 metric tons, an increase of 89,856 metric tons compared to the same period last year. Domestic tung oil exports from Shanghai this month totaled 542 metric tons, an increase of 284 metric tons compared to the same month last year. The total for the first nine months of this year was 11,543 metric tons, an increase of 5,107 metric tons compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>Regarding the tung oil market this month, with the arrival of new oil approaching, both buyers and sellers adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Inventories were still abundant, and supply was quite active. However, European and American demand remained sluggish, resulting in quiet transactions and a downward trend in the market. Although there were occasional transactions by foreign firms in Hankou, no large deals were made. At the beginning of the month, the market hovered around 61-62 yuan, but then consistently declined, even falling below 50 yuan by the 19th. Subsequently, the market became uncertain and fell into a state of stagnation. Although foreign firms had some spot goods to sell, their asking prices were too low, and traders were generally unwilling to sell, leading to an almost complete standstill in spot trading.</p>
<p>Shanghai oil prices softened due to frequent declines in Hankou. Foreign firms showed little interest, and the market atmosphere was quiet. Zhejiang oil was also affected by the decline in white tung oil and depreciated accordingly. General hoarders, anticipating the arrival of new oil, lowered prices to sell off their stocks. The chaos in the market in the early part of the last ten days of the month, when prices fell to 48 yuan, can be imagined.</p>

<h3>Securities: Public Bond Trading Very Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was extremely sluggish, with a slightly weakening trend. Trading by all parties was very slow. Due to the depressed situation and it being Saturday, various sectors were observing, and the number of attendees at the meeting was particularly scarce. Only the first session in the morning saw more transactions, and subsequent sessions were extremely quiet. Major players remained on the sidelines. Market sentiment remained stable, but it was anticipated that something unfavorable would inevitably happen in North China. Yesterday's trading saw scattered transactions at the opening, with prices falling by a few cents. The closing was quiet. Category B near-term and long-term bonds, and Category A near-term bonds, failed to open. Category E long-term and Category D near-term bonds showed no movement. The remaining bonds fluctuated slightly, with differences of only five cents. The afternoon opening saw most bonds unchanged, with a few rising or falling by five cents or a dime. However, Category A near-term bonds rose by 15 cents. The closing was even quieter, with only Category D and C long-term bonds showing a rise or fall of 10 cents. Most others remained unchanged, and a few did not open. The quiet situation was unprecedented. The final market prices showed only Category D near-term bonds rising by 10 cents, while the rest mostly fell by five cents to two dimes. The total transaction volume was 1.84 million yuan. The results of the price fluctuations are compared in the table below. (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: 100 Yuan)</p>

<h3>More Hexia Rice Arriving Daily, Sales Still Slow… Market Prices Declining</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various regions became even more abundant, with 63 or 64 boats arriving, carrying a total of 13,500 to 13,600 shi (a unit of dry measure). Thin rice accounted for two-thirds of the total, and thin rice was selling well. Merchants from Qingdao, Yantai, and other regions bought 4,000 to 5,000 packages. However, the market conditions were still not good, because the supply was indeed abundant. Despite this buying activity, supply still exceeded demand, leaving a considerable surplus. This led to harsh demands from the buyers, while sellers were more discouraged. As a result, the price of green rice continued to decline, with high-quality rice depreciating by 25 cents and mid-grade rice depreciating by 20 cents. The reason why mid-grade rice depreciated slightly less than high-quality rice was that it had already fallen more in the previous market. Thick new japonica rice remained unchanged, only selling in rural areas. The price was slightly adjusted due to scarcity. Looking back at the overall situation, with the daily surge in shipments, it is still difficult to predict whether the buying activity will lead to a better market. The arrival and sales of Du Yang sharp-pointed rice were equal, with no rise or fall in price. Since Yin Yuan rice had been declining steadily for days, it is now showing a high-stable and medium-weak situation. There is no fixed standard for thick and thin broken japonica rice.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 42 or 43 boats arrived from various Hexia routes. Sales of various goods in the market remained slow. The price of medium-grade new japonica rice fell by 7-8 cents, the price of Yang Du sharp-pointed rice fell by 5-6 cents, the price of Yin Yuan rice fell by 10-20 cents, and the price of top-grade thin rice also fell by about 10 cents. The price of Jiashan Baige rice fell by 20 cents. The sales of various sharp-pointed rice from other regions were not smooth, and prices were barely maintained. In the evening market, the price of a special new japonica rice called Yao Liangbao from Changzhou was sold for 10 yuan and 9 cents, which has not been seen since the Western New Year.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Still the Main Destination for Ke Xian Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival and sales of Ke Xian rice both decreased, and the market returned to a stable state. Yesterday, Ke Xian rice was still mainly sold to Guangdong merchants, with more than 5,200 packages sold throughout the day. Only 100 packages of Taiwan Xian rice were sold by this street, and the rest were all bought by Guangdong merchants. With local demand sluggish and little interest from northern merchants, the market could have declined. However, the continued demand from Guangdong kept people optimistic. A total of 2,134 packages of Jiangxi rice, 300 packages of Hunan rice, 3,080 packages of Shanghai Han brown rice, and 180 packages of Taiwan Xian rice were sold. Prices were similar to the previous day. Sellers wanted to raise prices, but were prevented by the weakening sales to Guangdong.</p>
<h3>Children's Savings and the Thrift Movement</h3>
<p>—Jun Peng</p>
<p>Saving is a good virtue. Now, I sincerely report a good news to all dear little brothers and little sisters: On the fourteenth page of the fourth issue of this newspaper on October 1st, there is the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, children's savings method, ah! Children! If you want to save money, it is explained in detail there, I will not repeat it.</p>
<p>How lucky you are, the food you eat and the clothes you wear are all provided by your fathers and brothers, how comfortable! How happy! Hey! For example, isn't your father giving you pocket money or candy money every day, isn't it a dime or twenty copper coins? If you only spend ten coins, children who get twenty copper coins every day, then you have ten coins left, like this every day, by the end of the month, you will have one yuan, send it to the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau or the bank to save, and in ten years... twenty years... thirty years... there will be a very large sum of money.</p>
<p>We should know, where does the pocket money and candy money come from? It is the brainpower... the sweat and blood of fathers and brothers, so we have to save it, gather the scattered money into a whole sum, to deal with natural disasters, man-made disasters, illness... and all unexpected accidents, and recently the National Government advocated saving the country, we children, should also vigorously promote, thrift is the simple and simple spirit of the new life, saving is also the best way to develop thrift, because since there is surplus money to save, for all expenses, there will naturally be a saving mentality, hoping to save more and more money, so that there will be a larger sum of money in the future. Children! Get up and implement it! We are the small practitioners in the thrift movement. Ah!</p>
<h3>Starting from the Sword Presented by Children in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>—Shi Peng</p>
<p>This time, the children of Jiangsu Province, to celebrate Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday this year, each donated one candy money, which was directly remitted to the Education Department by the Education Bureau or school of each county; about thousands of yuan, a sword was cast to present to Chiang Kai-shek's birthday. After the Education Department received the money paid by various schools, it entrusted the Shanghai Huadong Sports Equipment Company to cast the sword. The company has cast the sword, and its shape is the same as the ordinary command knife; but it is made of pure silver, with gold thread in the middle, and the four characters "Leader of the Group" are engraved on it, which is extremely magnificent.</p>
<p>From this fact, we get two lessons:</p>
<p>1. The enthusiasm of the children of Jiangsu Province for patriotism and national salvation is worthy of our admiration. They believe that to save the country, we must first unify the beliefs of all compatriots in the country, and then have a wise leader adjust our steps, so that all compatriots in the country stand on the same front and consolidate our national defense. Chiang Kai-shek is our only leader in the country, and no one can deny it. Therefore, the children of Jiangsu Province accumulated money to cast a sword, especially to express their admiration for his merits and hard work.</p>
<p>2. From this resolution to cast a sword and donate money, we can see that the money spent on candy by children every day, every month, and every year is indeed huge and large. Why don't we save it one by one? "Many grains of sand form a pagoda", "Many hairs make a fur coat", one coin a day, thirty coins a month, three hundred and sixty-five coins a year. If all the children in the country are like this, how big is this number!</p>
<p>Children! The American America Children's warship is worth your envy, right? I also hope that in the near future, China will have the China Children's warship patrolling the sea, or a certain provincial Children's plane soaring in the sky.</p>
<p>This, I think you will probably be very happy to do it, right?</p>
<h3>The Sailing of the Ship</h3>
<p>—Zhen</p>
<p>One day, Min'er's family received a letter, only to know that his uncle was seriously ill in Guangzhou, and the family was very worried, especially his grandmother. How profound is the old lady's love for her son! So she asked Min'er's father to go to Guangzhou to visit his uncle. He went alone on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Unknowingly, more than two weeks passed before his father returned from Guangzhou. The family was certainly very happy, because they had been looking forward to it for many days. They asked him if his uncle had recovered a little, how was the situation on the way? Was it calm? It was such a lively scene.</p>
<p>The next day, Min'er opened his mouth and asked his father: "Dad, did you go on a China Merchants Bureau ship? Did you go from the ocean?"</p>
<p>"I took a China Merchants Bureau ship in Shanghai, and when I left the Wusongkou, it was calm. The scenery at that time was really different from the scenery on land, especially when the sun was setting, it was particularly beautiful. Later, I passed through the East China Sea and arrived in Hong Kong, and then from Hong Kong to Guangzhou."</p>
<p>"The East China Sea must be very big. On this vast sea, how can the ship's helmsman know that this road is to Guangzhou?"</p>
<p>"The East China Sea is certainly very big, and beyond it is the Pacific Ocean. They must be very skilled in driving to be able to recognize a road to Guangzhou on the sea. Haven't you taken a small steamship? When the small steamship is sailing, isn't there a person called "老大" (Old Man) blocking a steering wheel on the bow to make the ship turn left and right? The big ship also has someone next to the steering wheel to steer. But the "老大" of the small steamship can freely turn the steering wheel according to the situation, while the person who steers the big ship must listen to the captain's orders and cannot turn it by himself. He only has to look at a compass in front, the compass is the compass, keeping the direction of the compass issued by the captain. Once the ship leaves the port, the captain issues the direction of the compass - it can also be called the compass course. This compass course is obtained from a very detailed map of the sea surface. This nautical chart records: the depth of the water, the nature of the seabed, whether it is mud, sand or rock, the height of the mountains, where there are reefs, and where there are lighthouses, are all recorded clearly, and there is also a direction map. The captain finds the safest and shortest route from the starting point to the destination on this nautical chart. Then he pushes the square foot to the direction map to measure its direction. In addition, the influence of the wind, tide, iron quality on the ship, and the difference between the Earth's magnetic pole and the north and south poles at that time and place, etc., so they sail on the sea in a certain direction from this compass course, but human knowledge and experience are limited after all, so there are often various errors."</p>
<h3>Two Good Times in the Morning and Evening</h3>
<p>—Fan Xianwei</p>
<p>During the day, children are in school, dang, dang, dang, class is over, with the passage of time, in form, from 9 am to open the schoolbag to 4 pm to leave school, even if the work of the day is over, in fact, where can it be considered finished, only the work in the classroom, the time is limited, not to mention that there are still unclear places, or have not been printed in the small brain?</p>
<p>Now the class uses a fractional system, usually each session is only 30 minutes, at most 40 minutes, in the blink of an eye, it is dang, dang, dang, class is over, to be honest: in the hours of class, several major subjects are almost entirely the students being instilled - listening to the lecture time, like a bottle filling water, the leakage and non-leakage of that water, is entirely up to you to pay attention and maintain! Because there is simply no chance to review "swallowing dates whole", how can you get practical benefits? It's like eating a delicious side dish, if you don't chew it in your mouth, the throat is over, isn't it going to be "the taste is lost immediately", so children should add some self-study efforts in addition to class, only then is the work finished, and get real knowledge!</p>
<p>What is the best time for self-study? "Morning" and "evening" are really the most appropriate, and getting up early every day can also improve physical health, the morning spirit and light are better, suitable for writing, calculation, etc., (at least one hour) in the evening, the electric light will damage eyesight, suitable for reading, doing diaries, doing handicrafts, etc., (also one hour) if you can do this without interruption for one day, the benefits are really immeasurable! Because two hours of self-study a day is sixty hours a month, and seven hundred and twenty hours a year, how great!</p>
<h3>Farewell Song</h3>

<p>Rest assured that there are successors.</p>
<h3>Children's Life Silhouette</h3>
<p>—(Liu Photography)</p>
<p>Children! Nails should be trimmed often, Organize the schoolbag before going to school</p>
<h3>The Egg That Disobeys Orders</h3>
<p>—Ziliang</p>
<p>Take an egg, pierce a hole at both ends of the egg, pour out the yolk and egg white, and mix iron powder and wax together at one end, heat it on the flame for a while to melt the wax in the egg and solidify the iron powder at one point, so that it cannot move. This egg that disobeys orders is made. If you want it to sleep, it just wants to stand up. If you want it to stand upside down, it just turns a somersault and stands upright again. If you draw a human figure on the egg, it will be a very interesting tumbler. You can also use this tumbler as a magic trick in front of your friends. You can say to your friends: "Everyone look! This egg is so disobedient. I want it to sleep, but it just won't sleep. Let me cast a spell to make it obey my orders."</p>
<p>As you say this, pick up the tumbler and bake it on the fire a few times to melt the wax in the egg. Then quickly shake the egg so that the iron powder and wax in the egg do not solidify on the eggshell.</p>
<p>After doing this work, you can say to your friends: "Okay, okay, now the tumbler obeys my orders! Everyone look, I want it to stand, it stands; I want it to sleep, it sleeps!"</p>
<p>If you play with skillful techniques, your friends will be surprised. This is also done by applying the center of gravity of the object. Children, why not try this game at home!</p>

<h3>My Sister's Little Invention</h3>
<p>—Xian Sheng</p>
<p>—How to Wash Away Stains in Bottles</p>
<p>Children, I will tell you a practical method; that is, how to wash away the stains in the bottle. This is a recent invention by one of my younger sisters, she dare not hide it, and asked me to write it out to tell you; I think the invention is not very important, but it is very practical, so I agreed to her and started writing about the process of her invention and this method. If you praise her for being clever after reading it, then my little sister will definitely feel happy and open her little mouth to smile at you.</p>
<p>It's like this, this half year she was promoted to the first grade of senior elementary school, the school stipulates that she must practice writing English letters, isn't that need to use blue ink? To buy a bottle of blue ink in the store costs eight copper plates, and it is a very small bottle, and it will be finished before long. My little sister is very economical, she bought five copper plates of indigo blue to dissolve herself, so she can dissolve a big bottle, enough for a semester, isn't that very cheap?</p>
<p>But after the indigo blue was dissolved, she found that there was no bottle to put it in, which made her embarrassed. Although there are many milk bottles and juice bottles, these bottles are not suitable, not only is it inconvenient to dip ink, but it is also very tiring to carry, and wouldn't she be laughed to death when she took it to school!</p>
<p>Later, she finally found a bottle of my used ink under the bookcase. This bottle used to hold red ink, so there were only red marks inside. She was very happy, and hurriedly washed it with water, but because the red marks had been around for a long time, they were stuck like paint, and it was not easy to remove. She wrapped a layer of cloth around a chopstick and stuffed it into the bottle to wipe, and the layer of marks on the bottom was removed by her, but the layer of marks around it still existed, because the bottle mouth was small and the chopsticks could not wipe it. This made her distressed again. She tried all kinds of methods, but none of them worked. When she was extremely distressed, she didn't know how she found a pile of fine sand on the ground in the corner. She had an idea and thought of putting these sands into the bottle, adding some water, and then shaking the bottle hard to make the sand rub inside, wouldn't it be possible to grind off the stains inside? She did as she did, and sure enough, in less than a moment, the bottle was washed brightly.</p>
<p>Children, if you encounter the same difficulties as my sister when washing bottles, you can do it in this way, I can guarantee you will succeed; because I have also tried it several times!</p>
<h3>The Flying Technique of the Flying Fish</h3>
<p>— Dong Xun</p>
<p>The flying fish is a very peculiar type of fish. In biology, its scientific name is Cypse'urus agoo, also known as the swallowtail flying fish. It is a type of marine fish belonging to the Ostariophysi order and is found in tropical and subtropical oceans. This flying fish is about one and a half feet long. What makes it most different and unique from other fish is that its pectoral fins are exceptionally large. Their front end almost reaches the base of the caudal fin. When opened, they resemble the wings of a monoplane, and their color is semi-transparent. The upper lobe of the caudal fin is larger, while the lower lobe is smaller. As for its pelvic fins, they are located almost before the anal fin, divided into two sizes. The larger pelvic fins resemble the rear wings of an airplane when flying, so they are called four-winged flying fish when combined with the pectoral fins. The smaller pelvic fins are only called two-winged flying fish. These two types can be said to be the main types of flying fish, because they, like other fish, are divided into many species.</p>
<p>The flying fish can be called a natural glider. It can fly out of the water at a speed of 50-70 per second and soar above the water's surface. When it is flying, its pectoral fins are very stable, unlike the wings of birds, which flap in the air during flight.</p>
<p>A biologist specializing in flying fish, Mr. Carl Hubbs—a researcher at the Zoological Institute of the University of Michigan—said after years of research that the flying fish's flying method is very unique. When they are about to fly out of the water, they fold their pectoral fins and move straight towards the surface of the water (A). The pectoral fins unfold as soon as they emerge from the water, and the front part of the fish's body flies out of the water (B). The lower lobe of the caudal fin strikes the water surface, generating the power to fly out of the water. Within one second, its caudal fin can strike 50 or even 70 times (C). When the pelvic fins unfold, the fish's body completely flies out of the water (D), and both pairs of fins (pectoral fins and pelvic fins) are fully unfolded. (This refers to the four-winged type of flying fish) (E). The flying time of the flying fish is extremely short, only half a minute, but sometimes they dip their caudal fins into the water, which allows them to take off again and continue flying above the water. The posture of the flying fish when entering the water is also very beautiful. It puts its pectoral fins together, makes a turn, and enters the water (F).</p>
<p>When flying, flying fish often make quick turns. Because of the excessive speed, they often bump into other fish or even boats. Sometimes they are hit by high waves. The posture of their flight, when viewed from a distance, looks like a semi-circular arc, which is really beautiful!</p>
<p>There are many interesting creatures in the ocean, and the flying fish is just one of them!</p>
<h3>Flying Fish</h3>
<h3>Filial Piety (2)</h3>
<p>— Hai</p>
<p>The day arrived; she went to the whispering pine forest, praying to heaven to give her the courage to present this idea to her father and have him accept it well. But prayers are often not immediately effective. Her father quietly listened to her speech and then called his wife, saying, "Hey! Here comes a female benefactor! Our daughter is preparing to go to St. Petersburg to intercede with the emperor on our behalf." Then he told his wife about his daughter's plan. His heart was pounding, and his voice contained a joking tone.</p>
<p>His wife opened her mouth and said, "She should do her job properly and not say such senseless things." Poor Pascoffe was very upset when she heard this and couldn't help sobbing. Her mother handed her a cloth and said softly, "Dear, go wipe the table, prepare dinner, and then comfortably go to St. Petersburg."</p>
<p>Days passed like this, and Pascoffe brought up her idea again, asking her father to consider it. Her father became angry after being pestered and strictly forbade her to mention it again. She had no other way but to restrain herself; but for three consecutive years, she still prayed every day for the realization of her plan. During these three years, her mother had a serious illness that lasted a long time. Pascoffe took care of her while also managing the housework, gaining great trust from her parents. They no longer treated her as a child. When she brought up the old topic again, they no longer laughed at her, but earnestly advised her not to abandon them, because they were old and weak and couldn't do without her for a day, and it was very dangerous for her to go out alone on this long journey. She said nothing, but tears fell silently, but she couldn't abandon this long-standing plan.</p>
<p>But to set out, she had to have a passport, otherwise, she would be immediately sent back to Yizhi Village. Moreover, her father had submitted requests several times before, but they were all ignored. If he made any more requests, it would be the same useless. Fortunately, Pascoffe received help from an exiled official, who helped her apply for a passport. After waiting another six months, the reply came that she had not committed any crime, of course, she could freely leave Siberia, and the passport was sent. As soon as her father saw the passport, he snatched it and locked it up. He said that no matter how she begged, there would be no hope, so he was unwilling to let an eighteen-year-old girl go alone on this arduous journey.</p>
<p>Pascoffe still insisted on her idea, begging her mother every day to persuade her father to allow her to leave. In the end, her father couldn't resist her and finally softened. He said, "What are we going to do with this child? Since she is so determined to go, then we have no choice but to let her go." So he said to Pascoffe, "Poor child! Do you think that talking to the emperor in St. Petersburg is as easy as talking to your father in Siberia? His palace has soldiers guarding every gate, and you can't even cross the threshold. Moreover, we are as poor as beggars. You don't have good clothes to wear, and no one will introduce you. How are you going to see the emperor? And who will lead you into the palace?"</p>

<h3>Interconnected Calls</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>In recent years, China's long-distance telephone business has been advancing rapidly. According to statistics released by the Ministry of Communications, the mileage of lines expanded each year is more than 10,000 kilometers. As a result, business has been opened in the east, calls have been completed in the west, and commercial ports, important cities, and even inland towns and cities can all make calls and communicate freely. The convenience for the public to use telephones is indeed improving day by day.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications' rapid development of telephones is due to the adoption of a phased construction method. The so-called phased construction means division of labor and cooperation. Therefore, once the plan is set, the construction teams proceed separately, carrying out construction and erection at the same time. As a result, the Beijing-Tongzhou section was completed soon, and the Tongzhou-Zhengzhou section was also completed. The Beijing-Hankou section was also completed soon after. Interconnected, all places along the line are connected. If so, then its construction is phased, but the result is still consistent, connected to each other, forming interconnected calls.</p>
<p>The result of interconnected calls can increase human interaction, shorten geographical distances, and save time. It has a significant contribution to the development of domestic industry and commerce. This point should be well known to anyone. Now that the country is in trouble and foreign aggression is imminent, even leaving aside industry and commerce, national unity, unified steps, and concerted efforts against foreign enemies are the urgent tasks at hand. China has a vast territory and abundant resources. Critics often say that it is like a plate of loose sand. The way to remedy this is to unite first. The construction of transportation is to promote domestic unity. Once the Beijing-Hankou line is open, the distance between Beijing and Hankou is as close as neighbors. If there is another transfer, then the provinces of Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, etc., will also respond quickly. In this way, the whole country will be tightened invisibly, the land will be concentrated, making the interaction between people closer, and the connection between the central government and local governments closer, enhancing mutual relations, and enriching the strength of unity. This is the inherent meaning of interconnected calls.</p>
<p>Once the interconnected calls of various provinces are open, the connection between various provinces is also established. When we use this telephone to talk to people in any province, we feel that each other's voices are clear, and the communication is pleasant and seamless. In the past, mountains and rivers were obstructed, and communication was difficult. Now, speech can be heard, as if face-to-face. If we think deeply, we are indeed a family across the country. Sincerity can be achieved, and we cannot help but feel a sense of love and unity.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Actively Rectifies Official Telegraph Fees</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Approved Three Relief Measures, Hoping that Heads of Political and Military Institutions Will Pay Attention</p>
<p>In order to rectify the charging of official and military telegrams, the Ministry of Communications submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan to implement it earnestly from July 1 of this year, and also attached three rectification measures for official and military telegrams, printed and posted notices. At the same time, it notified all telegraph offices that they should strictly follow the order of the Executive Yuan and strictly implement it. Thereafter, official and military telegrams should be charged in cash according to regulations, and there should be no leniency.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the above measures, most institutions have paid fees according to regulations, but there are still a few bureaus that have failed to do so due to financial difficulties or budget constraints. Regarding this point, the Ministry of Communications has jointly formulated three relief measures with the Ministries of Finance and Military Affairs, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) All institutions sending telegrams from July 1, 1936, should pay cash according to the revised regulations on the charging and restriction of official and military telegrams. All institutions, schools, and troops under the Military Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Military Affairs that fail to comply shall be responsible for collecting the arrears by the commission and the ministry. If other institutions fail to pay the required amount of telegraph fees due to the 1936 budget already being distributed, they should state the reasons and report to their respective competent authorities for verification. If verified to be true, they may be allowed to use the funds comprehensively within the original budget of the institution, or find other ways to increase funding to compensate for the arrears.</p>
<p>(2) Telecommunications is an important national undertaking. If it is not thoroughly rectified, it will have a great impact on politics and military affairs! Rectification and maintenance require funds everywhere. If various institutions do not strictly comply with the payment methods, not only is rectification hopeless, but there is also the risk of collapse! All institutions must comply with the regulations. If they fail to comply again, the telegraph office may stop sending their telegrams.</p>
<p>(3) Sending telegrams should not be excessive. Unless it is an emergency, fast mail should be used instead of sending telegrams at every turn. The text of the telegram should also be as concise as possible and not be lengthy.</p>
<p>The above three measures have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and forwarded to the National Government, ordering all directly subordinate institutions to comply and issuing separate orders. While we are grateful to the government for its painstaking efforts to maintain telecommunications, we should also clarify the three measures, hoping that heads of political and military institutions will pay attention to them!</p>
<p>1. Political and Military Institutions Should Maintain Telecommunications: Telecommunications is one of the transportation undertakings, which is of great importance to politics and military affairs. Daily maintenance depends on the income from telegraph fees. According to statistics, official and military telegrams sent by political and military institutions account for more than 60% of the annual number of telegrams. If the fees for these more than 60% of official telegrams cannot be fully collected, then the only thing to rely on to maintain telecommunications is the commercial telegram fees of less than 40% of the number of words. Telecommunications funds will naturally feel insufficient. It is also found that the annual arrears of official telegraph fees owed by political and military institutions are always more than 3 million yuan. If this huge amount of arrears is not remedied, not only is telecommunications construction hopeless, but there is also the risk of complete collapse! The impact will not only affect public communication but also military transportation, which will almost be cut off! In order to maintain telecommunications, the telegraph office has to comply with the order of the Executive Yuan to stop sending telegrams for institutions that do not pay fees according to regulations.</p>
<p>2. Political and Military Institutions Should Pay Fees According to Regulations: In the past, various institutions had limited funds due to budget reasons, and the amount of telegraph fees could not be determined. Once they are asked to pay fees according to regulations, there will be various difficulties. Now that the Executive Yuan has issued this order, if the amount of telegraph fees listed in the 1936 budget of various institutions is insufficient, they may state the reasons and report to their respective competent authorities for verification, allowing them to use the funds comprehensively within the budget of the institution, or find other ways to increase funding. Since the budget scope of various institutions has been expanded, telegraph funds can be said to be sufficient. Therefore, telegrams should be paid according to regulations to fulfill their responsibilities and cannot be excused by financial difficulties or insufficient budgets.</p>
<p>3. Political and Military Institutions Should Save on Telegraph Fees: Since there are the above-mentioned relief measures for telegraph fees for political and military institutions, there is certainly no problem. However, in order to maintain the budget, it is necessary to restrict sending telegrams. Only by restricting sending telegrams can we save on telegraph fees, and only by saving on telegraph fees can we maintain the budget. There are two ways to restrict sending telegrams: (1) Do not send telegrams unless it is an emergency; (2) The text of the telegram should be as short and concise as possible and not be lengthy. The former reduces the number of telegrams sent, and the latter reduces the number of words sent. If the number of times and the number of words are reduced, the telegraph fees will naturally be saved. Moreover, by saving the cost of unnecessary telegrams, there will be no arrears in telegraph fees due to insufficient budget when necessary telegrams are sent. Therefore, there is much room for research when considering the gains and losses.</p>
<p>The above three items, on the one hand, clarify the results of the Executive Yuan's approval of the three measures, and on the other hand, state the responsibilities of political and military institutions in maintaining telecommunications. Maintaining telecommunications is to maintain the Executive Yuan's orders and the ability of the political and military institutions themselves. I think that wise heads of political and military institutions will not dismiss these words.</p>
<h3>General Description of Types of Long-Distance Telephone Calls</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhen</p>
<p>The recently revised Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Business Regulations of the Ministry of Communications will be implemented from December 1 of this year. The names of various types of calls stipulated in the new regulations have been changed and are different from the current names. The comparison is as follows:</p>
<p>Original Name　Changed Name</p>
<p>Ordinary Call　Ordinary Dialing</p>
<p>Express Call　Express Dialing</p>
<p>Ordinary Notification　Ordinary Calling for Person</p>
<p>Express Notification　Express Calling for Person</p>
<p>Ordinary Call　Ordinary Paging</p>
<p>Express Call　Express Paging</p>
<p>Reserved Call　Scheduled Call</p>
<p>The new regulations divide long-distance telephone calls into the following three types:</p>
<p>1. Dialing Call: A call in which the caller dials the telephone number of a certain place without specifying a certain person to answer the call is called a dialing call. For example, "Nanjing—22450."</p>
<p>2. Calling for Person Call: A call in which the caller dials the telephone number of a certain place and specifies a certain person to answer the call, or specifies a certain user of a shared telephone, a certain extension of a private small exchange, or a certain part of a store or institution to talk to, is called a calling for person call. For example, "Tianjin 51847 Zhuang Yongfa." In addition to specifying A as the recipient, the caller may also specify B as the representative of the recipient, or specify another telephone number of the recipient for substitution. For example, "Tianjin 51847 Zhuang Yongfa or Cheng Bao Ying," "Tianjin 32239 or 32241 Ma Guozhang."</p>
<p>In various stores, residences, schools, apartments, institutions, etc. in China, the local telephones are usually answered by servants who then call the owner or other person in charge to answer the call. Because it requires a transfer, it inevitably takes a little time. If this is done, there is no time limit for local calls, and there is no economic loss. However, for long-distance telephone calls, if we use dialing calls, according to regulations, the time is charged from the time when the calling exchange connects to a certain telephone number in a certain place and the receiving user starts talking to the caller. Therefore, if the call is answered by the servant of the receiving user, and then the owner or other person in charge is called to talk, and the time spent is one or two minutes, and the talking time exceeds three minutes, then another charge must be paid, which is a great waste of money. However, for calling for person calls, according to regulations, the time is charged from the time when the recipient, or his representative, or a certain extension of the specified private small exchange, or a certain part of the specified store or institution, starts talking to the caller. Therefore, it does not waste time and money because of the transfer. Therefore, if long-distance callers know that the other party's telephone is for public use, or is usually answered by servants, it is better to use calling for person calls, which are faster and more economical, than to waste time and money due to the transfer.</p>
<p>3. Paging Call: A call in which the caller calls for a certain person in a certain place, but the recipient does not have a telephone, and the receiving telegraph office has to send a messenger to call the recipient to the telegraph office, or specify the nearest long-distance telephone retail store, or public telephone office to talk to, is called a paging call. For example, "Beiping Wu Yiku No. 13 Ye Yao Cheng." In addition to specifying A as the recipient, the caller may also specify another person as the representative of the recipient, so that if the recipient is not there, the representative will go to contact him. However, this representative of the recipient is limited to those who live in the same place as the recipient. For example, "Beiping Wu Yiku No. 13 Ye Yao Cheng or Lu Wen De."</p>
<p>The above three types of calls are divided into ordinary and express. All three types of calls for dialing, calling for person, and paging that are made in the order of registration are called ordinary calls. If the caller requests that the long-distance telephone calls he has made be put before other ordinary calls to connect the line, or notify the receiving telegraph office to send a messenger to call the recipient to the telephone to talk, they are called express calls. The locations where express dialing, express calling for person, and ordinary or express paging calls are open are determined by the Ministry of Communications and then announced by various telegraph offices. Paging calls are limited to recipients within the business area of the telegraph office, and those who have not specified a business area are limited to 3 kilometers from the office. According to the current long-distance telephone business regulations, a special fee must be added to the paging notification in addition to the call fee, and one-third of the call fee must be added to the advance notification. After the new regulations are implemented, the same fee will be charged for the above-mentioned calling for person and paging calls, and the special fee or the additional one-third call fee will be canceled. This new regulation is slightly different from the current price, and long-distance telephone users should pay special attention to it.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned ordinary and express calls, there are also the following three types of special calls in the new regulations:</p>
<p>1. Special Call: If the caller needs to talk to a certain person in a certain place between two specified telephones at a fixed time of day for a fixed period of time, it is called a special call. The above-mentioned special calls are very convenient for major commercial firms to report commercial market conditions. However, the registration period must be at least one month, and the call fee must be paid in advance by the applicant. The applicant and the telegraph office must sign a contract to ensure good faith.</p>
<p>2. Scheduled Call: A long-distance telephone call that is pre-scheduled for a call time within the business hours stipulated by the telegraph office when the caller registers is called a scheduled call. However, this scheduled call must be registered several hours in advance before the scheduled call time, and the time is determined and announced by the telegraph office.</p>
<p>For the above two types of special calls and scheduled calls, if the long-distance line is already occupied when the scheduled call time arrives, it should be connected after the already connected telephone call is completed.</p>
<p>3. Night Call: A long-distance telephone call that is made from a certain time to a certain time at night, and the call price is lower than the daytime call price, is called a night call. This call is very convenient for news reporters to transmit news, and it is also cheap.</p>
<p>The locations for the above three types and other special long-distance telephone businesses are determined by the Telecommunications Administration in accordance with actual needs and the complexity of the lines and submitted to the Ministry of Communications for approval. The detailed methods and prices are regulated separately. As for the registration procedures, call order, and billing methods for using long-distance telephones, they are not within the scope of this article, and I will talk about them in another article.</p>
<h3>Explanation on the Supplementary Collection of Address Fees</h3>
<p>— Chao Ao</p>
<p>A telegram that uses an expired registered address instead of the recipient's name and address will be stopped from being delivered according to regulations. In order to facilitate the public, the Ministry of Communications has previously formulated a lenient measure. If there is such a telegram, the address fee will be supplemented, and it will still be delivered. This was originally a lenient measure to facilitate the public. However, it has often caused misunderstandings recently. The reasons for the misunderstanding are nothing more than the following: (1) Sometimes the recipient does not have money on hand and asks the telegraph office messenger to deliver the telegram first and pay the address fee later. The messenger refuses, and the recipient is anxious to see the telegram, which causes a misunderstanding. (2) Sometimes the recipient delays taking the money for too long, and the messenger urges, which causes a misunderstanding. Now let me explain them separately:</p>
<p>Regarding item (1), the telegraph office originally respected the recipient's wishes, and the messenger used to do so. Later, because there were several disputes, some recipients refused to pay the address fee after reading the telegram, and some said that the telegram was not theirs after reading it and refused to pay the fee. The messenger had to pay the address fee back because the telegram had been opened. From then on, the messenger refused to deliver the telegram first. However, because of the dishonesty of one or two people, the vast majority of trustworthy recipients felt inconvenienced. In order to remedy this shortcoming, the telegraph office is researching remedial measures to make it convenient for the public who have always been trustworthy. However, it is best to hope that registered recipients will go to the telegraph office to renew their registration before the registration expires to avoid the loss of paying the address fee.</p>
<p>Regarding item (2), the telegraph office has a limited return time for messengers to deliver telegrams in order to avoid delaying the telegrams. If there is a delay, there will be punishment. Therefore, if the messenger has to wait for a long time, he will feel that there are difficulties in his work. I hope that the recipients will forgive this.</p>
<p>In short, the occurrence of misunderstandings is often that neither party is wrong, but just some small gaps. Once explained clearly, they will be resolved!</p>
<h3>Radio Programs and Children's Education</h3>
<p>— Xu Weili</p>
<p>—Solving a Difficult Problem for All Parents—</p>
<p>I once read in a Shanghai newspaper: "Although Shanghai's radio stations are highly developed, the programs broadcast cater mostly to base and vulgar tastes, which has a significant impact on children's lives. Most stories involve mythology and even absurd fabrications, which not only fail to assist children's education but also harm children's minds. Therefore, many parents have specially made wooden boxes to lock up the radio as soon as their children come home from school to prevent them from listening."</p>
<p>We express our sympathy to all parents who care for their children and see this as a sign of progress in family education in China today, where parents are paying close attention to their children's education. We sincerely hope that all radio stations across the country can understand the parents' painstaking efforts in education and broadcast programs beneficial to children as much as possible during after-school hours to assist in children's education.</p>
<p>Now, there is good news to share with all parents: the Shanghai Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications, based on supplementing social education and promoting wholesome entertainment in the family, has specially established a children's program, with many children's education experts in charge of broadcasting children's stories, etc. This is to enhance children's knowledge, learn the national language, and hone their eloquence. Listening to it after school will surely achieve twice the result with half the effort in children's education. Furthermore, children will no longer seek other harmful entertainment when they hear interesting educational stories. All families with wireless radios are invited to listen to the educational programs broadcast by the Shanghai Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications at a frequency of 1300 and a call sign of XOHC, which will surely satisfy you.</p>
<p>Recently, the station has been broadcasting children's programs (daily from 6:30 PM to 7:00 PM) (except Sundays). They have specially invited Ms. Hu Ying, a former children's education expert from Peking University, to tell the story of "The Hardships and Efforts of a Poor Boy," briefly recounting the story of a poor boy who was originally a descendant of a noble family but was dispossessed and abandoned by his uncle. He was later adopted and, at the age of ten or so, wandered around with a street performer. Eventually, by chance, he met his mother and younger brother, who was very ill. Unfortunately, they were soon separated again. After the separation, the poor boy continued his wandering life, experiencing many difficulties and dangers, and finally reunited with his mother and brother, eventually becoming a great man. The plot is full of twists and turns, and the writing is lively. Ms. Hu tells it vividly, and children will surely be interested in listening. We hope all wise parents will pay attention to it.</p>
