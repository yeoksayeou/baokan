<p>（南京）最近僞匪進犯綏遠、情勢日趨嚴重、民情輿論、允爲激昂、中央宣傳部發言人二十日對記者發表關於時局問題之談話、大意如次、</p>
<p>（一）吾人要知一個獨立國家、其國家之主權、無論對內對外、必須有充分自由之行使、簡言之、卽對內必使其主權爲絕對、對外必使其主權爲獨立、中國目前問題、看來雖似複雜、然苟以此理爲之綱領而貫通之、實爲簡單、中國現已完成統一、政令普及全國、僅西北極小部分匪區內之同胞、尙未脫離水深火熟之苦境、此種匪徒、其組織、其號召、其背景、已爲國人所深刻認識、其爲破壞國家統一與妨害民族生存、殆無疑義、而偽匪軍又復內侵、其存心何在、背景何在、亦屬有目共睹、而其爲侵犯國家主權與危害政府威信、更無稍異、故不論其所居之名爲匪爲奸爲盜爲寇、其爲害同、其爲吾人之敵亦同、站在國家與政府之立塲、對此次不容稍事姑息、誓必盡力勦滅、蓋已爲今日之國是、（二）在南京進行中之中日交涉、時日推移、已逾兩月、政府對此、早經我外交當局前後表明、卽國交調整之原則爲平等與合理、近來國內及國際間之輿論、對於中日交涉、均謂中國政府及外交當局已盡其應盡之最大責任、甚希望日本方面能充分認淸中國立塲、並使中國人民對中日邦交調整交涉、確能改善兩國關係、達到棄嫌修好之願望、此種論調、旣能代表中國國民之心理、亦可見國際間共同合理智之判斷、今日中日交涉關鍵、完全擊於日本方面、最近僞匪大舉內犯、邊氛日亟、國民情緒高漲、甚至注意綏察軍事之熱心、遠過對於進行中之中日交涉、此中態度之歧異、實足爲鄰邦朝野極好之研究資料、</p>
<p>（三）綏東情勢緊張後、國民情緒甚高漲、而態度極沉毅腹地如此、邊省亦然、因今日綏察之問題、極簡單明瞭、來犯者不論其爲僞爲匪、或其他任何勢力、同爲國家民族不共戴天之大敵、於此應付之方、惟有迎頭痛擊、惟有根本勦滅、地方疆吏於此有顯明之表示、中央當局更有明切之指導、態度顯明、毫無猶豫研究之餘地、故數日來前方軍訊、匪衆雖屢决猛犯、無不慘敗、此固由前方將士之英勇、亦賴中央之統籌主持、始有此上下相維內外一心之現狀、全國人民若更能鑒於此種事實、以沉着鎭靜之態度、整齊統一之步驟、信任政府、共赴國難、匪寇之掃蕩殲滅、又奚待蓍龜、</p>
<p>（四）綏察警報傳出後、全國民衆、對於前方將士所給與精神之鼓勵、效用甚宏、近數日來、各地學生及民衆發起之募捐慰勞前方將士運動、允爲踴躍而熱烈、此誠人心民氣最可珍貴之現象、亦國事前途最堪樂觀之點、惟是政府對於勦匪軍事之接濟、自有一定之籌劃、而全國人民之捐募輸將、組織與支配、允須雙方注意、否則散漫混雜、雖一時之勇氣可嘉、而其結果之有裨於實際蓋寡、往事可爲股鑑、故本部前决於「貢獻一日所得」運動、曾訂定推行辦法、登載全國報紙、前日復於慰勞綏遠將士募捐運動、增訂補充辦法、刋載報章、深望愛國人民、能按照各該辦法以求貢獻於國家也、（二十日中央社電）</p>

<p>常熟是江蘇省的一區富庶之地，的確當得福地兩字，　朝的翁同龢就是常熟人，所以那時有八調侃李鴻章和翁同龢，做了一付對聯說：「宰相合肥天下瘦，司農常熟世問荒。」世間的荒歉，雖然不是為了常熟的常常熟年而言，但是常熟是一處好地方，確是對的。</p>
<p>常熟縣城居四鄉之中，城西北卽虞山，一部分山地　在城裏，所以前人有「十里靑山半入城」的名句。</p>
<p>虞山並不大，要是你健步，一天够你窮幽探勝的了。在常熟你是會感到山靈水秀究是什麼一回事的。要是你不信，你可以立在劍門（虞山風景最雄偉處，削壁懸崖，通一小徑。）的道上，放眼一望，只見湖水澄碧，烟樹蓊　，一方方的田畝，種着很整齊很有生命力的農作物，黃一塊，綠一塊，靑一塊的，使你看了不僅是心　神怡，實在使你有把這許農作物揉碎了，攪爛了，和着肥沃的泥塊一同吃到肚子裏去的念頭，你將說眞是塊「虞山福地」呀！</p>
<p>農村的三種吸血者</p>
<p>在常熟，有三積吸農民血肉的人們，他們仗了固有的或新興的勢力，寄生在這塊福地上來殘害農民，毫不留情地把一塊塊農民所有的肥沃的田地和黃一塊，綠一塊，靑一塊的作物呑下去了</p>
<p>常熟是以出米著名的，但是完全種稱的地方，只限東南兩鄕，因爲河港很闊，土地肥沃，確確實實可以稱上魚米之鄕。至於西北鄕，則一半種稻，一半種棉，米只能自給，棉則大都賣去。僅有沙洲一處，都是長江裏淤漲出來的沙地，所以十分之九是種植棉花，十分之一是種稻，另成一個作物區域的。</p>
<p>但是，富庶的農田不是農民所有，豐盛的物產，不是農民所佔，農民一年到頭，胼手胝足，勞苦所獲的，却給不勞的人一層層的剝削而去了。</p>
<p>在常熱，農田是集中在地主手裏的，農民能自有的，依我的估計，不到十分之四，東南鄕的自耕農更少。本來，地主是擁有許多田地，很易剝削農民的，可是常熱的一般地主，另外加上一層勢力，另有一種形態，就是他們大都擁有一種政治勢力，凡是大的地主，很多是做過官的，所以，官越做得大，田地越多：田地越多的人，愈易做官。</p>
<p>大地主家裏常用許多催租吏和賬房，他們就是直接施用威權和剝削農民的人。農民不會計算，只好聽他們從中取利；農民用米還租時，每隻袋裏一定要多放幾升，因爲地主家裏的斗升比較的要大些。</p>
<p>官府是爲他們服役的，每逢秋冬，四鄕都可以看　衙役的奔波，一羣羣貧苦的農民跟着他們到城裏來了，或是典質交租，或是，吃官司。</p>
<p>第二種吸血者是徵收吏，他們不　直接從農民的錢糧上多刮一分二分就算了事，據說最大的進益，還是有田無據，有糧無根的一點上剝削的。</p>
<p>在十地淸丈後，這種積弊或者可以消滅，但是，每年數萬的（據人估計或在十萬左右。）金錢，都是農民的血汗，却被他們吃了幾世了。</p>
<p>第三種吸血者似乎是濱江各縣的特產，因爲沿長江常常有淤積的沙地可以開墾，在開墾之先，有一般被稱作「沙棍」的人，向縣去報稱他有數千畝或幾萬畝沙田在某處，願繳納每畝幾角錢的費用，讓沙地慢慢堆積起來時，沙棍們就可以享受這利益了。爲了不多費錢，可坐收大利，所以沙棍們爭奪得很利害的，凡是一塊沙地要圍築時，一定要招集幾白幾千個勞苦農民，互相搶圍沙田，那方的勢力大，就圍的地多；由此，往往要發生械鬥，傷亡是常有的事。</p>
<p>沙棍們利用農民圍築了沙田後，或是分賣給農民們，只費十元的本錢，可以賣到五六十元，農民們是佔不到分　好處的。或是租給農民耕種，因爲該處濱江，容易？生水災風災，所以一般沙棍把田租給農民時，先要農民繳納所謂「板租」，以後田地的荒歉，統　農民負責。農民們把他們造成了富翁，立刻就來吸收自己血管裏的餘血去了。</p>

<h3 id="c43">世界銀價的前途 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— 幸</p>
<p>從一九三三年美國開始大購白銀以後。世界銀價逐漸高漲起來。到了一九三五年五月。由於美國在世界銀市的　斷。銀價開始猛跌。直到本年一月中旬。才趨穩定。從那時起。到本月初爲止。紐的銀價沒有多大的變動。世界銀市歷史上。這可算是銀價最長的穩定時期了。可是到了最近世界銀價却又發生變動。十一月六日起。倫敦孟買兩地銀價都突然堅漲。九日起。紐的的外國白銀價格跟着大漲。最折幾日。各地銀價似乎略有回跌。但尙未跌到本月前穩定時期的銀價水平。</p>
<p>要明白此次銀價之所以突然上漲。先得認識美國在目下世界銀市是居於獨佔的地位的。這可用統計數字來證明。一九三四年。世界產銀總額達一萬八千萬盎士。用銀國輸出總額達二萬六千萬盎士。合計四萬四千萬盎士。就中美國政府購進了三萬一千萬盎士。一九三五年。它收買的數量更大。不但把世界產銀總額二萬一千萬盎士和投機家囤集的一萬六千萬盎士盡數吞去。還把用銀國所輸出的吸收了一大部分。總數是五萬四千餘萬盎士。本年份截至九月底爲北。據美國商務部報吿。美國所吸收的白銀計値一萬五千萬美金之巨。照每盎士四角五分計。白銀數量的合三萬三千萬盎士。這已經比一九三四年全年所吸收的超過很多了。</p>
<p>美國旣然是目下世界白銀唯一最大的主顧。各自由銀市的投機商似乎再也沒有操縱銀價的可能了。我們很分明的可以看出目下的銀價只是美國政府向個別國家的定的市塲價格。而和自由銀市的市塲價格性質上是有着差別的。世界白銀已不能視作尋常的商品了。</p>
<p>這一種銀市現象不但足使世界白銀投機家無由活動。而且更重要的。足使那些以白銀作爲國際收支準備的國家。感受着不小的隱憂。中國目下雖已脫離了銀本位。可是仍以銀爲貨幣準備。在當今情勢之下。只有我們能在國際收支上找出適當的調整方法。只有我們可以不靠「資本的出超」過活。我們的幣價才不會因銀價的變動而受到嚴重的影。</p>

<p>— 劉湛恩</p>
<p>本校成立於民國紀元前六年，爲美國南北浸禮會所創辦，專路藍縷，慘淡經營，至於今日，滄桑屢易，興革迭乘，敎育權改由國人主持，垂及十年。開辦時，規模簡陋，學生僅有數十人，敎員數人，校舍一所，經濟設施，諸感艱辛。今得於歇浦江濱，購地四百餘畝，　舍連雲，氣象萬千，學生數逾一千，敎員百餘人，畢業生之服務社會者，已達千人。附屬有中學，小學，城中區商學院，滬東公社，鄉村服務處，亦均邁往直前，逐年發展，斯皆我滬大師生三十年中精神合作，努力奮鬬，故能有此表現：而各界之策助，允爲可感者也！</p>
<p>茲者本校爲慶祝三十週紀念，舉校師生，爰于今日，出版紀念冊，天籟季刋，復假各報發行紀念特刋，宜示國人，以期拋磚引玉。余維已往締造之艱辛，與將來應有之努力，夙夜以思，本校前途之亟待發展者，厥有數端：（一）發展各學院，改進課程，添聘敎員，增購儀器圖書，並視需要，增設學系。（二）擴充研究院，創辦研究所，將原有研究學程，加以整理，並特別注重社會，經濟，國際關係，與自然科學之研究（三）改進附屬各部，如中學，小學，城中區商學院，滬東公社，鄉村服務處等，在人才與經濟可能範圍內，均將積極擴充，益宏效能。至推而言之，國際形勢之複雜，社會環境之變遷，外侮日亟，國難嚴重，將如何指導靑年，敵愾同仇，復興民族，以圖自力更生？尤爲本校今後之重大使命。所冀校友同學一秉本校博愛犧牲之精神，恪守信義勤愛之校訓；臥薪嘗胆，警惕隨時，庶于此危難震撼之秋，担負艱鉅，犧牲小我，挽救大我，以達本校爲國儲村之目的。此則余于慶祝立校三十週紀念，歡欣鼓舞之餘，敬述所懷，渴望國內賢達，繼續指導！剴切提携！益增滬大光榮於無極</p>

<p>— 樊正康</p>
<p>本校創立，經多年籌劃，始於一九〇六年成立，一九〇九年正式開學，當草創時期，第一任校長柏德高博士，於其報吿書中曾言：『吾校開辦祗九閱月，最感困難者，厥爲敎員人選。本年有一二位敎員，雖爲飽學之士，而對課室管理及指導學生方面，有須改正者。不幸在此短時期間，已辭去一位，目前問題，爲如何提高程度，完成本校應負之使命。』云云。於此數語，已足瞭解本校過去之方針。三十年來，人事有代謝，而方針迄未變。上年度校長報吿書，有言：『本校成立以來，已有相當歷史。惟今日之成功，祗能稱爲嚆矢。吾人應繼續上進，以促成設立者之理想實現。』時隔卅週，而先後一貫。本校得有今日，不得不緬維今昔立敎之有方，苟有相當進步可言，未始非基於創立時期之功績，所謂根深而葉茂，　其是之請歟。</p>
<p>縱觀本校物質之進步，其足稱者，非在校舍之增加，而在逐年推進建築物之步驟，與夫全部計劃之决第實現。三十年前之建築物，祗課室一座。以後逐年添建，迄無間斷，無非以需要爲前提，因需要而籌劃，由籌劃而實現。有志竟成，此歷任校長所可自豪者也。且每於建築之前，一切費用，妥爲計算，非至欵項有着，不敢貿然興工。故歷年建築費至上年度止，已達一百〇九萬七千餘元，而從未有墊貸等情，蓋非出於自由捐輸，卽挹注於歷年之餘積。惟其有通盤計劃，按時邁進，故得有今日之結果，於此不得不追思三十年來執事者之苦心，嗣後範圍日廣，需要亦應時而增，但仍承旣定方針，祗願漸進，不求猛進也。</p>
<p>私立學校，每感經濟困難，滬江自亦不能例外。查本校經濟報吿，最初一年，經常費（建築費另計）爲九千二百六十二元，十年後爲六萬八千七百八十二元，相差的七倍。至一九二九年，增至二十八萬二千五百四十五元，的遞增五倍。及至上年度預算總數，達三十四萬餘元。前後相去固遠，然若以三十年應有之進步，作一度之比較，則本校落後尙多。但經濟困難乃爲事實，而量入爲出，又爲本校唯一應付方法。每當編製預算，必經多方修改，至出納相抵而後已。因此自開辦迄今，本校尙無絲毫虧負。此誠不足以自誇，蓋應興未興者正多，心有餘而力不足，尤感痛苦。然一念吾校前途，則固非是則不足以保障將來也。</p>
<p>歷年大學部學生人數自七人遞增六百三十一人，其成績頗有可觀。惟歷年全校增加之人數，平均未超過五十人，除一二年受滬戰影響驟减九十餘人外，其餘亦未過二三十人。所謂其進也漸，其退也緩。最近十年內，每屆新生亦不出二百人左右。三十年來，學生人數，順序漸增，以至今日，要爲可慰。其尤可慰者，乃在限制學額，得免重量輕質之嫌。至歷屆畢業人數，自二人至一百十一人。逐年按入學人數比較，（民十至民二十四）最高百分數爲百分之五二，最低爲百分之三二，換言之，一年級新生，能於四年修畢學程得予畢業者，祗半數而已。經濟及學業，當爲其二大原因。前者因經濟拮据，而中途輟學，後者爲成績欠佳而退學，或轉學。要其四年達到目標，而能副學校之所期望者，殊非易事也。</p>
<p>『三十而立』，本校已達壯年時期矣。此後種種展圖，乃爲意料之事。環顧國內大學，各有所長，而國家需要專門人才，方興未艾。木校既負一份之責，已有近千畢業同學，服務全國各地，其成績如何，自有社會人士之鑒別。惟對在校及未來同學，將如何培植之，俾應世爲有用之長才，立身有健全之品格，是不得不加意及之也。綜本校之有今日之成績，一言以蔽之，卽穩進而巳。穩進非猛進，亦非緩進，惟以穩健積極之步驟，應付環境，計劃發展，於校務則與時俱進，無苛求，無浪費，於經濟，則力崇節省，用歸於當。於敎學則注重基本學識，實事求是。世頗有以此爲可取者，故敷陳事實，以備社會人士欲知本校之成功，其關鍵所在云爾。</p>
<h3 id="c136">三十年來之滬大 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— 朱榮泉</p>
<p>浦江之濱，花木扶疏，紅樓三五，轟立共間，滬江大學在焉。蓋自創辦以來，已三十年於茲矣。此三十年中，其經營之慘淡，歷史之優美，有足述者。茲常三十週紀念之辰，特撮要以吿焉。</p>
<p>一　最初之十年　創辦時期</p>
<p>一，創辦計劃之完成　民國前十二年（西元一九〇〇年），美國南北浸禮會駐華敎士，因避拳禍，羣集上海，始有在上海設立大學之議，越二年，兩敎會連開聯合會議於杭於滬，立校之議始决。越三年，校董會正式成立。翌年（民國前六年卽西元一九〇六年），校董會正式選舉柏高德博士爲大學校長，萬應遠博士爲神學院長，購地三十四畝於滬東楊樹浦，鳩工庀材，興建校舍。計劃已久之滬江大學，乃得實現。</p>
<p>二，校務之進展　本校之正式開學，實爲民國前三年（一九〇九年）。其時校舍祗有思晏堂一所，敎員只六人，學生則大學七人，中學四十九人而已。其後校舍續有增築，敎員亦逐年增聘，學生亦每年增多。至民國五年十週紀念時，已新建校舍二所，敎員增至二十六人，學生則大學四十五人，中學百數十人。民國二年，在楊樹浦工人區域，創立滬東公社，本社會敎育之精神，爲貧苦之工友造福。民國五年，改行分科制，大學之規模始具。此數年中，因開辦伊始，百事求簡。執校政者多兼任敎職，而爲敎員者又努力襄助學校行政。上下一心，故校務得蒸蒸日上焉。</p>
<p>三，第一班畢業生民國二年六月，本校初决舉行畢業典禮。畢業生二人，一爲鄭章成博士，現任本校理學院長及生物學系主任，一爲鄔志堅先生，現任律師，會任中國麻瘋救濟院總幹事。二君對於中國科學及社會事業，均有重大之貢獻，亦卽本校所引以爲榮者也。</p>
<p>二　自十年至二十年　發展時代</p>
<p>一，新校舍之建築此十年中，校舍之添築者，有體育館，科學館，麥氏醫院，游泳池，幼稚園，思伊堂，中學上院，中學下院等。校舍既多，設備自周，校務乃益臻發達。前之大中學合設一處者，亦於民國十一年中學上院落成時分立焉。</p>
<p>二，男女同學制之實施　男女同學制，在歐美先進國，久已風行。而在中國，則因舊禮敎之阻力過大，無由實施。本校對於男女同學，主張最早亦最力。民國六年，通過此新計劃。民國九年，招收第一班女生。是時社會人士，狃於舊習，女生之來學者尙少。其後因新文化運動之推行，風氣頓開。而本校之實施男女同學制，亦漸著成效。於是各校之仿行此制者，相繼而起，男女同學之風，遂遍全國。</p>
<p>三，學生之救國事業　民國八年五月四日，北平發生學生運動，上海事生響應之。民國十四年五月卅日，上海發生南京路慘案，全市大震，學生運動，尤爲激烈。他校之遭此風潮而停辦者，屡見報端。而本校則以寬大之精神，盡指導之責任，務期救國讀書，兩不相背，故屢經風潮，而絃誦如故。</p>
<p>四，二十週紀念　民國十五年六月，本校舉行二十週紀念，舉其二十年之成績，昭示社會。蓋本校在中國大學中爲後起，然二十年中，發展極速，是時已與先進諸校，並駕齊驅矣。</p>
<h3 id="c137">本校校景之一女生宿舍 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>三　自二十年至三十年　革新時代</p>
<p>一，立案之經過　民國十七年，校長魏馥蘭博士辭職，改選劉湛恩博士爲校長，樊正康先生爲敎務長，實行華人治校政策，校努力進行立案事宜。民國十八年，奉敎育部令，准予立案，於是本校乃進入一新時代。</p>
<p>二，新時代之新發展　在此十年之新時代，經劉樊二先生之努力，校務益見發達，學生之多，每年超過紀錄，後至者輒因宿舍人滿見拒。校舍之新建者，有圖書館，中學大禮堂，女生體育館等。正在建築中者，有思魏堂，及大學禮堂等。其建築費，多數籌諸國內，足見本校敎育成績，已得國內人士之信任。敎員學生，亦年有增加，積至本年，更超過往年之紀錄計</p>
<p>大學部　敎員五七人　學生六二七人（男生三九二人　女生二三五人）</p>
<p>中學部　敎員二五人　學生四〇〇人</p>
<p>小學部　敎員五人　學生一四〇人</p>
<p>滬東公社　敎員二九人　學生七五二人</p>
<p>城中區商學院　敎員四九人　學生六百餘人</p>
<p>三，城中區商學院之設立　上海爲中國商業之中心，故商業一科，最應地方之需要。况職業靑年，公餘求學，尤苦於無機會。本校有鑒於此，力謀商學院之擴充，添設夜商學院於圓明園路。民國十九年，藝備進行。承商界領袖之贊助，得於民國二十一年正式開學。迄今巳有五載，先後添設大學本科，大學專修科，銀行學會計學專修科，新聞學科，建築科，外國語科，特科。歷年成績，頗得社會人士之贊許。</p>
<p>四，魏前校長之去思　前校長魏馥蘭博士，自民國前一年（一九一一年）繼柏高德博士任校長職，至民國十六年解職。前後凡十七年，之擘劃經營，備受勞苦。本校之有今日，魏博士功獨多。其學問道德，久爲全校師生所景仰。魏博士自退職後，仍在本校敎授哲學，直至本年，始因年老，回國退休，本校爲酬答魏博士勞績，特籌建思魏堂，以留紀念。魏博士又著有滬江小史一書，歷敘本校發展之經過，取材瞻博，敍事詳盡，實爲本校重要刊物。</p>

<h3 id="c148">西康代表馬澤昭　對滬敎育感想　感謝敎育界援助康生　希望全國收邊疆學生 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>西康民衆駐京代表爲澤昭、此次爲接洽西康學生入學手續、會來滬與陳鶴琴·黃警頑·舒新城·劉湛恩·鄭西谷·沈體蘭·何淸儒·吳孝友·等晤面將西康學生分別安置、並領導赴各處參觀、結果異常圓滿馬氏返京後、以印象深刻、特發表對上海敎育之觀感如下、</p>
<p>（一）邊疆一切事業均待建設、而其中之最重要者、莫若溝通文化、提高民智爲急、此爲數年來堅持之信念、然內地求學之西康學生、如果學成以後、即在內地服務、而不返回西康作事、則所謂溝通文化、提高民智之工作、卽僅能完成一部、而不能完成全部、上海文化界敎育界諸先生不僅對於邊疆敎育特別注意、此次向入學之康生訓話、諄諄以學成返康服務爲勉勵、此種卓見、實已把握邊疆敎育問題之核心、</p>
<p>（二）此次來京之西康學生共八人、巳在上海入學者四名、計入潑衷中學者一名、入上海中學者二名、入麥倫中學者一名、其餘或因年齡太幼、或因枸病滯京、暫時不能到滬、最初與陳鶴琴先生晤敎時、卽承於百忙之中領導分別接洽、復得各位先生之允諾、在短時間內卽將此事完全辦竣、其情趣之勢烈辦事之迅述、令人有無限之欽佩、</p>
<p>（三）參觀各校歷時頗久、所有學生均係生氣勃勃、同時承各校當局相吿、關於學校沿革、設校主旨辦理方法等、均極詳盡、並謂仍將以最大努力期望、不僅成爲吾國盡美盡善之中學、而且要成爲東亞盡美盡善之中學、此種精神是何等奮發、將來成績又是何等偉大、</p>
<p>現在受此種良好敎育之西康學生、尙只有四人、此後如何多多介紹自屬自己之責任、並望滬上賢能之敎育當局多多收納造就、俾西康學生繼續不斷到滬入學、回康發展邊疆敎育、更望全國敎育學校、當局均照滬上辦法收納邊疆學生、使全國　校無一處無邊疆靑年、則不徒一隅一地之幸實整個民族之幸也</p>

<p>婦女專刊怎樣纔配做現代的婦女？  童亦珍　　我們穿了二十世的時裝，挾了幾本洋裝書，或者能够信口開河的談些什麼什麼，就配做現代的婦女嗎？不，這些都是决要的問題，我們要做現代的婦女，首先應以懇切的態度，追念檢閱過去，警惕策勵將來，而且下堅强的决心與努力，去踐行左而幾個基本條件：　　一，健全的體格我國人民的體格，和歐美各國比較起來，實在戚覺到有些恐懼和慚愧，尤其是我們女子，和人家比較，那更不能以道里計了：唉！只怪我們從前自己不好，染了「弱不禁風」，「柳腰金蓮」等的餘毒，因此到現在會弄或這可怕的現象，我們要努力地從近於死路的桎梏中解放出來，去和大自然奮鬥，我們要做現代的婦女，第一就必須具備獅子般的體力！　　二，質樸的習氣我相信，誰也不能加以否認，我們婦女的奢侈心，的確是比人家大得多，我們看了海關報吿香水脂粉入口的數字，是多麼的使人寒心！在這國難之秋，我們擔負國家興亡的責任，也忙不分身，又使國家經濟多一很大的漏巵，怎對得起我們的祖國呢？我們要做現代的婦女，絕不應該再花枝招展似的那樣裝飾着，雖然「愛美之性，人皆有之」，但是我們需要的是質樸的美，要認爲香水脂粉以及一切裝飾品，那落伍的人們才會親近它，我們應該把這種東西棄之千里之外。　　三，獨立的精神數十年來，我們天天高呼着「自由平等」，雖然得到一部分人的同情，但是事實上仍舊被重重的壓迫着，我們探求其最主的原因，就是經濟不能獨立，因爲我們從古至今中了「嫁鷄隨鷄，嫁犬隨犬」依賴性的毒，我們要做現代的婦女，應該要有獨立的精神，誰也不能依靠誰，去求眞實的「自由平等」！　　末了，我希望全國女同胞，都成現代的婦女，來負起救亡圖存的使命！美國新聞界之一奇女子  螬食　　美國為婦人之天堂凡男子可為之事，女子盡可與之並駕齊驅，惟有職事最繁，而又須拚九死歷萬險之「從軍記者」，自環境與禀賦而言，似斷不宜於女性。乃不料歐戰方興之一九一四年，已有向充婦女雜誌記者之第一任墨西哥駐舊金山領事女公子慕嘉烈Evira　Virginia　MUGARRIETA氏，潛以三十五齡之壯年婦人，假扮男裝，化名JackBee　GARLAND介侖先生，馳往歐洲西戰塲，親臨深入火綫以內之前敵，探取戰報，以完成美國某大新聞集權公司特派員之使命。蓋介侖之意，深以婦女雜誌之工作範圍爲過小，不足暢遂一生事業之廻旋，特乘歐戰良會，一抒抱負，而遂更遠且大之雄圖也。厥後歐戰旣終，而介侖先生翩然歸國，御高領，吸粗大之葉捲烟，自駕小型汽車，出入於男記者雜座之酒排間，二十二年以來，絕未有人窺破其底蘊。其於非洲男峯Rif土人抗西班牙之戰，南美沛渠及布烈徽兩國之爭，以及近年義國對於非洲炎國之遠征，莫不有論戰之文，在各大報發表，其人久經實地之證騐，已成新聞界戰事一道之專家，人皆知其爲識歷甚富之介侖先生，已有積久成自然之趨勢，直至介侖先生，溘逝於本年九月之初，方有其平生之密友奭朋Miss　George　SHADBURNE女士，向人道及其特殊之行徑。此誠美國新聞史未經前人發見之秘密，有類乎小說家言與神話者也。　　按我國前任西班牙代使黃介淸之女公子訥亭，亦嘗作男子裝，例彼美國新聞界之奇人，可得謂之無獨有偶歟？日本前畑孃的體格  吉雲　　從世運歸來的日本游泳選手前細秀子，在柏林發揮了伊驚人的成績，使幾十萬觀衆腦裏留着一個對日本女子運動的良好印象。伊不但沒有辜負了自己平日練習的動苦，並且已完成了伊所負的使命。不要說女子，就是男子也是如此，勤於運動是足以使體格發達的，反之有驚人的運動成績，必有驚人的體格。我國出席世運的選手隊，號格方面已經落後，是此運動成綾不良，更爲可恥我國除了體操專門學校之外，女學校不但不注意於學生的運動，對女子的體格可以說毫不放在心上的。入學試騐時的體格檢查，也不過是官樣文章。做體育導師的，有誰注意到學生的體格，是否進步還是退步。一般入對於女子的體格的觀察，也僅注重曲錢美，人體美，不是窈窕婀娜，便是圓潤豐滿，是根本錯誤的。我們在此種非常國勢中，不需要此種電影明星和歌舞皇后的體格，而僅需要眞正健全的女子，以爲將來做小國民的母親。　　前細秀子自世運歸來，經竹內茂代女史檢體格之後，發現了可驚的結果。伊的身長爲一米六〇糎二，比日本男子的平均身長還長。（日本男子平均身長，以三十歲至三十五歲最長，僅一米六〇糎。）體重五八瓩五，也比男子爲重，（日本男子平均體重，以四十歲至四十五歲爲最重，五七瓩。）胸圍九〇糎四八，肩闊四一糎二，腰幅二九糎三，皮厚一糎四。下肢長八五糎，背上筋力一〇八兛，兩臂水平長一米六六極八，肺量四〇〇〇立方糎，胸圍比五八兛。　　前畑孃體格的特徵是兩臂水平長比標準長十糎，肺量較常人大至兩倍，背上筋力比全身筋力强二〇兛。胸圍比是胸圍和身長的比例，日本女子不及西洋婦女的便是此項。西洋女子標準胸圍比是五五％，現在前畑孃也勝過了。雖然日本婦女並非個個都和前畑孃一樣的有此種特殊優良的體格，或者我國婦女們未嘗沒有此種健全的體格。但是以一般而論，中日兩國婦女的體格，是相差很遠。我國女子因平日之不注意運動而體格不能發達，不但運動成績無優良希望，連處理家政，服務勞働，生產敎育都有重大影響的。讀者如將自己或是子女的體格和前畑孃的體格相比之後，便可以明白了。歌謠中的婦女問題  巴玲　　『小鼓圓上圓，我媽打我眞可憐。我是我媽浮心草，在家待幾年。人家地士我掃光，人家佛爺我燒香，人家媽媽我呌娘，他媽問他吃什麼？他說：鍋開豆腐煮米吃飯。』　　『白菜葉，舖地黃，我娘生我不氣强；從小吃的娘的奶，長大服侍人家娘；人家吃米我吃糠，入家吃麵我喝湯；渴的渴的怪悽惶，跑到後院哭一塲。鞭竿打在我身上，跳崖去，崖岸深：跳井去，井水小：攀住井橋瞧一瞧，望見娘家楊柳梢，楊柳梢，喜鵲呌，我的寃枉誰知道？　　上面這二首歌謠，在我國北方，是很流行的。使我們讀了以後，深深的感覺到一個苦命的女子，不幸而做了人家的婢女的苦况，是如何的可憐呢？　　的確，同樣是一個圓顱方趾的人類，爲什麼一方面是儘量的享受，而不以爲奇？一方面却要屈膝降尊的去服侍着，而處處地方還要受到極端的虐待與壓迫？這是人類的不平等，實在也是目前社會中一個畸形的狀態。　　「解救婢女，取締蓄養婢女。」這二個口號，在過去曾經給一般婦女界的領袖們，以及關心婦女問題的人高唱過。而且，政府方面，也曾經有過通令，然而，事實上，成千成萬的婢女們，還是不曾得到救濟，得到解救，這是一樁怎樣可憐而應該急切矛以救濟的事情啊！　　「救救婢女們，使伊們早脫苦海！這是伊們自己在歌謠中所流露出來的呼聲，也是婦女界一個不可忽視的問題。母親的愛  閻重樓　　孩子的眼裏還沒有母親，母親的愛裏却先有了孩子。　　母親對孩子很早就懷着一腔熱愛啦，當孩子還在孕育着的時候，母親爲了孩子，曾經做過不少美麗的夢，她夢見孩子那亮大的眸子，那蘋果色的面頰，那蓮藕般的四肢，……她夢裏的孩子眞是多麼活潑可愛呀！雖然母親爲了孩子，也常常發生精神恍惚，體態不適等等的痛苦。　　母親一方面希望她的孩子早點生出來，一方面又希望她的孩子生出來不會像她以前所見的孩子們那樣的愚蠢，致辜負了她約期望；終於在一個風雨的夜裏，母親的肚腹絞痛，母親的鮮血湧流，孩子便呱呱墮地了。　　在孩子無知無識的哭聲中，母親的臉上却露出一絲微笑，她要把孩子放在她的身邊，眼睛不時注視着孩子，她像是一個畫師完成了他的傑作，祗是得意鑑賞着他的傑作，而忘記了他在繪製傑作時所費的辛勞。　　然而母親的辛勞正還沒有終止呢，她時刻要拿乳汁喂着孩子，時刻要顧慮到孩子的寒暖；有時候孩子病了，她更是變心冲冲，寢食俱廢！必定要等到孩子的病痊愈了，她心裏才能曾時安靜。　　孩子漸漸地長大起來，母親對於孩子約期望也隨着年齡增進，因爲母親給孩子的熱愛也日積月纍得太深了；假使孩子是弱懦無能的，那麼母親的心血虛擲　她豈不要陷入絕望的深淵裏了嗎！　　孩子現在雖然漸漸地長大了，然而他的發育還沒有健全，他的智慧還沒有充足，在母親的熱愛以外，那惡劣的環境，也許有墮落他的危險。　　那麼孩子要怎樣努力自己的前途呢？要怎樣愛惜自己的生命呢？要怎樣報答母親的恩愛呢……這些都要看孩子的心，等待孩子將來的事實答覆吧。婦德婦容  　　另外一欄鄭母洪太夫人墓表  陳寳琛　　永春鄭生玉書·曩　及余門，今年秋，道沾上來謁、出所爲洪太夫人行略，以墓表請，泣而言曰：玉書生！五年而吾母沒，其時先君方旅食，玉書與弟玉麟祥麟皆幼，飾終之禮，多未備也。先君之喪後吾母，其生平具吳君曾祺所撰墓誌，而母氏弗詳。母氏無奇節，以玉書所僅知而能　者，則皆門內之庸　也。若得先生之言，表吳君所未及，俾鄭氏世世循爲婦則，斯吾母爲不死矣。按略太夫人系出南安洪氏，贈中憲大夫江淮公之孫，邑癢生致敬公之子，年十　歸鄭君淵如。其時江淮公以商業雄一邑，稱巨富，太夫人生長名門，且體孱善病，舅姑矜之，不令操勞：太夫人曰：婦有職，何敢　也。晨昏奉侍外，大而祭祀賓燕，小而烹飪　濯，莫不躬親。舅嘗患頸疽，日再敷藥，昧爽更進補劑，六閱月無失。時連喪父母，則受弱弟稚妹而篤撫育之，人稱一嫁之女盡心父家，罕如是者，則性情之摯也。早起督子女　學，夜則篝燈自課，館師飲僎，多縣手治，遇風雨則分餉及附學者。家務旣殷，親族復以針黹相干不忍辭。其自奉迺父至的；因病戚中餽海外參，輒以飲家人，紈綺盈筒，所服多補綴之衣。劬多頣寡，暈疾閒發，發則伏枕不御食飲，少兪復强起治事如故，則允行己之毅也毅光緒辛丑，舅巍亭公無疾而終，淵如公兄弟客未歸，伯姒又在產蓐中，內外事一身任之。終以過勞致病，病中又哭殤女，益不自支。初，大夫人嘗爲玉書聘洪氏女，至是自知不起，執玉書手，語之曰：自吾爲汝家婦十餘年，至今幸免　咎，今爾等未有立，而新婦且慳予一面，天乎命也！哭失聲。未幾，遂卒，年甫三十有五。玉書又云母氏沒二年餘，玉書卽授室，補邑弟子員，又年餘生丈夫子，及入仕，迎養吾父任所，益念母劬，乃使人建亭墓側，額曰思母，然而母子之志，皆至足悲也。予許人子有不忍死其親之心，則慈與孝且相永於無窮，夫何幽明之有閒哉？今太夫人雖未享中籌，而子姓蕃衍，報在身後，天之旌德爲不虛矣。用徇鄭生之請，書以揭於阡，亦俾世之修婦德者，無疑於善慶之理云。歲在上章敦牂仲秋之月閩縣陳寳琛表熙哥  雪影　　當我每次走到有竹子的地方，往往就會想　六姑婆家的那一片廣大的竹園大以及他家天井裏，花台上所種的許多別緻的方竹。的確，竹子在他們家裏，彷彿眞是一種特產，或是一個商標，每逢人家說起六姑婆或他家任伺一個人，我就會連帶想起竹子。那時候我年紀還小，當然不知道怎樣欣賞竹的風韻和它所代表的那種勁直的氣節，祗覺得在熱犬到他們家裏去，似乎比別處多少要風凉一些，而在秋天或冬天去，却又像格外要凄凉一些，別的我也不知道了。　　在一座差不多給竹子包圍着的書房中，時常在那裏盤桓的只有兩個人，一個是我的姑丈，—六姑婆的兒子，還有一個就是熙哥，他的兒子。熙哥是一個個性非常倔强的靑年，胆子也大，往往獨自一個人宿在那所離正屋的二三百步的古舊的書房裏；但他却並不歡喜讀書，極歡喜體操，歡喜運動，性格近於武的一方面，閃以很不爲以「世代書香」自命的姑丈所鍾愛，雖然他是一個獨生子。後來，大概還是他的個性太倔强的緣故，姑丈也拗不過他，就讓他進了陸軍學校，並且在畢業之後，馬上就正式入伍了。因爲他已入了伍，記得每决發生內戰，或舉行勦匪動員的時候，姑丈和姑母總是最担心，每天一早就打發人去買報，忙着要知道熙哥所隸屬的六十二師有沒有參加。總算還徼倖，熙哥當了五年的兵，由排長做起，一直做到了營長，論資位也是一個中校了。他大概每隔一年回鄕一决，每决的服裝似乎都比上一决要神氣一些，但是他的倔强的個性，却依舊一些沒有改變。　　今年夏天裏忽然得到了一個消息，說熙哥死了，怎樣死的呢？可是上陣嗎？不，他是目殺的。當時我就很震驚，便仔細從各方打聽了一番，最後才知道了這件事的內容。　　原來他的隊伍在春天奉命移防沿海的某一處小縣，這裏原是某國軍艦時常出沒的所在，艦上的兵士儘多公然上岸攝影，或描繪地圖的，先前的駐軍，往往抱着息事寗人的態度去對付他們，故得無事。熙哥一到那裏，隔幾個月又有同樣的事情發生了，他怎麼能忍耐呢？便立卽指揮部隊把幾個某國兵捉住了，並且還毀壞了他們的攝影機，以及他們所描的地圖。接着也把他們放了。不料第二天的早上，某國兵弄了許外小舢板，一下就有五六十名登陸，並且還帶着充分的武器。他們當然是來尋釁了。熙哥却一些不怕，調齊了隊伍，就在城外嚴陣以待，這樣倒把他們嚇退了。在熙哥想來，事情必然已吿結束，豈知半個月以後，突然有另一營官兵忽忽前來接防，熙哥因爲他們來突得元，便問那新來的營長；這個人就老實吿訴他爲了某國人的抗讓，他們的師長旣担了不是，他的頂頭上司——董團長又因和他有師生關係，竟把這件事自己担承了下來，悄悄地掛冠而去，現在祗要他調防，便沒有事了。熙哥聽了這一番，感憤到了極點，便立卽在營部裏自己用手槍打死了。他的部下知道了沒一個不哭得打滾：而這個英勇有爲的少年軍官，便在他自己的倔强的個性下輕輕地犧牲了。　　竹子，勁直的節，正象徵着他。本報特寫楊瑾珣女士談航空生活  萍　　學會初級飛行　更須進求深造　以報効祖國　婦女學習航空　比海陸軍適宜　願大家努力　　鼓聲鼕鼕，鼓我軍人勇。一鼓雷動，再鼓山嗚，三鼓波濤湧！……三這是我幼年在童軍隊伍裏唱的軍歌中最雄壯的一節，深印腦海，始終不會磨滅；如今國難愈急，匪偽又進犯綏遠，想到前方景象，無意中便哼起這老調來了。的確，我中華健兒，提起國家大事，誰不熱血奔騰，想做一番忠勇救國的事業，男兒如此，女人又何嘗不作此想呢！前天訪問一位楊瑾玽小姐，談了許多話，很切實中肯，堪作一般摩登女子的常頭棒喝！她是中國飛行社社員，早把志願寄託於航空事業，經這六個月的訓練，已能單獨飛行，當然不是輕易的事，以下便是我們的對話：　　據我的觀察，楊女士年紀雖輕，而出言做事，頗爲老練，態度誠懇莊重，意志堅强沉着，起初不願發表任何意見，她說：「自己覺得很渺小，學識也很膚淺，够不上公開講話。」我說：「別太謙虛，像你這樣千里而來，學習航空，犧牲一切的享受，在現代女性羣中，確是不可多得，縱不爲自己吹噓，亦當爲女界爭光。」經一再解釋，終於允許我略述個人的願望。　　首先她介紹自己的身世：「我原籍湖南長沙，今年二十五歲，父母都健在，有兩弟兩妹，一家都住在武昌。民國十八年冬，畢業於湖南省立二中師範科，這七年來，爲着謀生活，流浪過許多地方，却是失業和窮困伴着我奔走的時候多。但這些境遇，對我到有着很大的帮助和進益，同時它給我不少生活的經騐與智識，由困苦的生活中去磨練自己，這是學校敎育所得不到的。過去我曾經當過家庭敎師、公務員，打字員，岡書管理員等，這些工作，却是爲了生活，而不是自己的志願；我終身的志願，還是在航空。　　「你幾時起纔有學習航空的動機？」「我對於航空，有着極大的興趣，自從看見飛機，就想學飛，以前到不過是想飛罷了，現在我却是暸解爲什麼而飛？記得「一二八」淞滬之戰那年，是我剛離開上海不久，住在北平的時期，雖未親歷那塲戰爭，但同樣緊張的心絃，每日接讀申報，只有更多的苦悶，心裏的炸彈，眞要爆發了呵！敵人的飛機，任意來到我國內擲彈，而我們同胞，却是用血和肉去拚，整千萬人的頭顱和身體，在炸彈下變成肉醬，甚至不知去向，建築物更不用說了。這些印象留給我們，不是悲哀，而是憤怒！集攏每個的憤怒爆發出來，會變成什麼呢？那是不能隨便想像的東西，但這不能隨便想象的東西，總有一天會表現它的眞面目來。因此我準備着自己，便决定學習飛行，爲我技術修養上，唯一的目標！」速寫—楊女士　　「加入飛行社後的興趣如何？」　　「我們社裏學習飛行的女社員，只有我和密絲陳兩人，但我相信想學的女性，一定很多，希望第二期招生時，女子能佔一個相當的數目。在別國的飛行訓練班，女性都踴躍參加，並且女子在飛行史上也有着各種新紀錄，難道中國婦女界就不能產生飛行人才麼？我們自然不甘落後的，趁政府提倡航空和人民擁護的現在，願大家努力！再一個多月，我們就要畢業，這不過學會初級飛行，效命空軍，更須嚴格的訓練。據我半年來的經騐，深覺飛行不是一樁極難的事，祇要鍊成金鋼不敗之身，抱定奮鬥的精神，犧牲的决心，必然可以成功的。　　「學習飛行後的感想如何？」　　「我常想：（一）中國民族的獨立生存，抵禦侵略，不單是要人民多買飛機獻給國家，還要國家多培植航空的人村，而且要自己能製造，能大量的生產；（二）二十世紀是航空的世界，不僅空戰將支配這時代，就是民用航空，也普遍的發展，其發展的限度，會使現在的人想像不到；（三）在這幾十年中，一個民族，如果不能保持自己的天空領域，這個民族，必將爲他民族所奴役！」　　「飛行社畢業後，將定何方計？」　　「學完初級的飛行技術，只會駕駛民用機，當然是不够的。我想進一步學會駕駛軍用的戰鬥機和轟炸機，纔可以入空軍，上前錢，殺敵人，以報我們的祖國！所以我惟一的方針，便是升航空學校，進求深造。」　　「對於婦女學習航空有何意見？」　　「女子的體格，也許不及男子，至於天賦的智能，本沒有顯著的高下。現時因爲女子在社會上一切都沒有地位，所以女子學習航空，便覺得奇怪，而女子自身也就縮首不前，其實事在人爲，身歷其境，到也沒甚稀奇。最近報上說西班牙婦女的愛國精神，便想起中國女同胞，要快快的趕上人家。至於婦女與航空，似乎比參加海陸軍適宜得多，因爲駕駛飛機時，只要運用最敏捷的頭腦和最輕快的動作，而不需要多大的氣力，比曠野奔馳的陸軍，與驚濤駭浪搏擊的海軍，自不可同日而語，這是我個人的見解，還希讀者來指敎！」</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊靈樞素問  劉馨柏醫師　主答　　紅腫毒　　第九十八號，浙江餘姚菴東市兩浙鹽務稅警第三區區部易東藩君問，敵人左腿膝後偏面上三寸之處，瘡不似瘡，癤不似癤，西醫亦難診斷。茲將各項病原列後：初起時候如米一粒，覺得且痛且癢，就將國藥號自製的普通拔毒膏藥粘貼，次日潰破稍爲流出血水，因膏藥粘性太足然四圍皮膚稍爲紅腫，一連換貼三日不見有效。然後即用中醫開的藥方其藥名列下（龍骨，海漂硝，黃升丹，冰片，）研成細末搽之，日換一次，覺得痛更甚，見得膿毒流出，其皮膚仍續腐爛，就換用九一四藥膏搽敷，搽之一大歷仍不見效，反四圍漸漸更腐爛，其洞深二分大，雖稍可走路，非要蹺蹺然可走，且甚覺痛。係住在一海濱之處，且無良醫，亦無良藥。請賜敎：（一）是否瘡癤惡毒？（二）會不會蔓延再爛永久不愈？（三）要不忌口什麽可以吃什麼不能吃？（四）用什麽藥治療可以完全照原？（五）請最有效藥指敎我。　　答：（一）是癰·（二）會。（三）忌煙，酒。（四）先請醫肌肉注射『佛哥』（Novargo）二針，（隔日注射）用『得來沙耳』（Trisal）化水三十倍，蘸棉花揩淸創口，用『碘仿』（Iodoform）（此藥用時宜謹愼，不可太多）撒入創口，再用絨布一大塊，塗佈三分厚之『三福消腫膏』（Sanfloid）一塊，在火上微薰貼上，每日更換一次。（五）見（四）。　　胸部刺痛　　第九十九號，天　路一六七號，裕豐號張不弱君問：三年前在乳下內部早九時後，午後五時，微覺刺痛，歷時二分鐘。過後便照常無恙。天亮時感覺喉閒痰鳴有聲，以致咳嗽並作，又有時氣噎。此病狀三年如一日，繼續至今。請問（一）是何病？（二）服何藥？　　答：（一）有肺病嫌疑，不經診查，難以確實說明。（二）『星牌精製魚肝油」（Cod－Liver　Oil＂Star　Brand＂）。　　單睪丸與疝氣　　第一〇〇號，寗波路永亨公內三八號，康必杭君問：敝人生來卽係單睪丸，位於左方。俗謂凡是單睪丸的人，雖不影響於生育，但生男儘管生男，生女儘管生女，不會男女兼生。在上述的病態中，右方尙有疝氣牽制，昨日劇痛。查此病由幼時發現，逐年腫脹，及至最近大如桃子，恐尙續漲不已。請問（一）單畢丸不會兼生男女之說確吾？（二）有無治法？（三）疝氣須服何藥始能見效？（四）楚吾要住醫院，長期診治？　　答：（一）胎兒在成形數月後始决男女，與最初之精蟲關係現尙未明，但此說可决定其不確。（二）診後始知，如係潛伏畢丸，用手術可治。（三）疝氣是器質病，藥物無效。（四）本病亦須手術，手術後須住院，但不須長期診淋。　　大量濃痰　　第一〇一號，虹口如皋路三〇一弄九號等勇君問：敝人前决來函問病，蒙先生答覆，不勝感謝。今來函又有問題數個。我的病情如下：經醫診斷是氣管枝擴張之症，每日吐的濃痰的三四百西西，咳嗽今無，肺癆亦沒有，精神總算很好，熱度亦沒有。就是道濃痰，每天到中午的時候，必須咳出纔好。否則氣管中甚覺不適，連呼吸都有痰的聲音。若使勞動過度，那麼，這痰略覺多些。但是除這痰之外，其他毫無疾病的。我每天作的工作呢？就是在園內散步，但不做任何運動。下午一點至三點睡臥，同時日食三次淸魚肝油。夜間每天八時許睡覺，早晨六時許起身。現在請問先生幾個問題如下：（一）這種病狀是否時常要吐血的？（二）若吐血的時候有何危險？（三）怎樣能預防吐血？（四）吐血的時候應該怎樣治療？（五）這種疾病，讀書及辦事和運動可能否？（六）據我所做的工作相宜吾？（七）我現在的發育尙好，不知此病將後能痊愈吾？（八）鼻子不通，是否與氣管支擴張有關？　　答：（一）無。（二）見（一）。（三）服『新亞鈣』劑（Sinocalcin）一日十次，每小時一粒。（四）見（一）。（五）輕微運動可。（六）相宜。（七）有由身體漸强而自然治愈的，但進不可預期的效果。（八）無關。　　頻咳不已　　第一〇二號，閘北江灣路，上海法學院，敦笛梵君問：家母年四十，久息咳嗽，每至秋冬卽發。發時頻咳不已，並多痰。請明示（一）是否因體衰所致？（二）當服何藥？（三）是否肺病？　　答：（一）年老體衰之人，每至冬季，因寒風刺　而發咳嗽；同樣體質，因受寒風刺　，易患急性氣管支炎，此爲咳嗽之又一因。（二）服「咳利舒開」（Kresocal）。（三）診後始知。　　手淫遺精　　第一〇三號，西摩路四號，楊關宗君問：鄙人幼年誤患手淫，故近數年時患遺精——大的每星期一次。市上遺精丸亦已服有多種，但不能斷根，只能暫止一時。故藥服完後，若稍有刺戟，卽又復發。前閱貴醫師之問答欄中，說及服用『補美心」（Bronmagsin）可治。故請求指敎：（一）『補美新』是丸劑抑水劑，何處購買，價若干，服多少可以全愈？（二）失眠與面瘡與此有關否！（三）痊愈後記憶力可恢復吾，的須多少時間？（四）如服該藥，於早洩亦有效吾？　　答：（一）『補美新』是水劑，各藥房均售，價格逕向藥房詢問，『服多少可以全愈』請閱仿單。（二）失眠爲神經衰弱之症狀，與手淫遺精有關，服此藥有效。面瘡（座瘡）爲春機發動期之皮脂腺分泌較盛，與手淫遺精無關，服此藥無效。（三）病愈後記憶力可略佳。（四）有效。　　失眠早洩　　第一〇四號，赫德路七五號，丁一夫君問：鄙人因身體自幼卽不健康，十五六歲後，卽覺睡眠常有不安。至二十歲，始知已患失眠症，後因生活問題，易地工作，睡眠漸入好景。惟因從事文化事業，且偏於頭腦勞動，失眠時發時止。二十三歲結婚後，失眠更甚；且甫交卽洩，毫無性的樂趣。幸而夫妻相處時期不長，常賦別離；不然，身體當更衰弱矣。來滬以前——卽與我妻同居時期，因担任報社事情，須執筆爲文，竟患過十天以上的失眠。卽不完全失眠，也不過處於半睡眠狀態，似知不知，似夢非夢。自木年五月來滬後，因執筆爲文之時不多，失眠也較少。其故殆因我早晚——臨睡前與起床後——曾靜坐半小時，且因易地和不用腦之故。然間也有全夢失眠，不過沒有從前之甚。最近，稍稍看書，半月以來，睡眠不安之症又來矣。我是一個頭腦勞動者，不看書不寫作便無以爲食，而且也有許多不平事迫我必要執筆者。試問（一）在此情形下應如何療治？（二）我想長服一種治腦的藥，取其便利而又經濟者，應用何藥？（三）有其他天然治療方法否？　　答：（一）調整生活方法，早晨早起，夜間早眠，在夜間六時以後不再用腦，白日行適常這動，（如散步，拉彈簧）睡前行溫水浴有效。此外有氣候療法，遷居中等度高地或海濱，如爲環境所許可，不妨一試。最重要的是睡前央除一切雜念，如念多心經一遍卽甚佳（固然各人有各人信仰，不能相强。且以科學家而介紹宗敎，允屬不對。但吾人反宗敎之原因是因科學之日益進步，神鬼之說，再也不能控制現代人之思想。但如能透視宗敎之內面，因知其尙有高深之哲理在也。抱研究哲學之眼光而讀多心經，孰能謂我迷信？）。（二）可服『補美新』（Bromagsin）此藥是中樞神經鎭靜劑，久服無害。其能致人成習慣性之催眠藥，恕不介紹。（三）見（一）並忌飲茶，咖啡，及煙酒。　　先天遺毒　　第一〇五號，王愼從君問：敝人未婚前好冶遊，惟是否曾患梅毒，則自己亦不淸楚，祗在陰天下雨之際，骨間隱隱作痛耳。今年春間生一女，身體非常衰弱，自生至今無一日不在病痛中。而其身上有二特點：身上常發各種式樣的疹子，和肛門有一塊多肉。此外眼睛怕光，見風流淚，和牙齒（一對）不齊，請問（一）是何病？（二）身上常時發疹是何物？（三）何以眼睛怕光？（四）牙齒不齊何故？（五）不治有無危險？（六）何藥治？　　答：（一）先天梅毒。（二）先天梅毒之患兒身上時常發疹，如小膿疤疹，濕疹，薔薇疹，天疤瘡，丘疹等。（三）大的是虹彩炎。（四）『哈勤松氏齒』。（五）不治預後不良。（六）注射『六〇六』及『梅掃凈』（Merson），前者每星期一針（〇·一五），後者每三日一針，用量請醫酙酬。　　兩脚水腫　　第一〇六號，張致中君問：敝人心跳，精神不安，便秘，食慾不振，疲怠，兩脚無力，從前每日所行之路，現在行一半，已覺疲倦不堪。此外兩脚水腫，起初是在足踝，現在不但兩脚全腫，卽下腿亦腫，已腫至膝下矣。請問：（一）是何病？（二）是何原因？（三）如何治法？（四）如何休養？　　答：（一）脚氣。（二）缺乏維他命B4，兼細菌感染。（三）服『維他命B』（Vitamin－B　＂StarBrand＂），注射『退惡水』（Theosal）。（四）安臥，多食蔬菜和麪包，禁米。談言從「人言可畏」說開去  子南　　阮玲玉小姐被舊禮敎和黃色新聞殺死之後、曾留下「人言可畏」的遺書。使我們悵然傷悼一代藝人的喪亡之外，還明白原來黃色新聞可以作殺害弱者的兇器。　　但在弱者的遺骸還未陳屍堂前的時侯，黃色新間却也是　乎其然的名之爲「輿論」的。事情一過，還是名之爲「輿論」，直待第二次的慘劇重現，並且那被殺害者必須是於社會是稍有聲望者，惹得起社會人士的注目纔算，不然，爲了一則黃色新聞而使你悄悄地去自殺，那是等於死了一隻狗。　　自然，那被殺者是個弱者，不然，他是决不會乖乖地低首下心的授首於人的。　　最近，則是法國的內務部長薩郞格羅氏也因爲受了右派報紙的誣蔑誹謗而自殺了。　　薩郞格羅氏是個社會主義者，牛平又寫過不少政論，照理，他是應該不會自殺的，他的政敵們的機關報雖然誣蔑他說「歐戰期內，臨陣脫逃」，但經審查結果，不是「證明無罪」嗎？旣經證明無罪，從反面看來，就十足暴露了對方無恥的誣蔑，於自己的人格和名譽是一無損失的。　　然而薩郞格羅氏却終於自殺了。這不能不使我們說他一聲弱者。　　一個社會主義者，一個戰士，他越在受到敵入攻擊的時候，是越應該顯出他的英勇來的，這戰鬬不僅是爲了自己，也是爲了大衆：幸虧薩氏的自殺是在案情大白之後，不然，不是更給敵人以「畏罪自殺，的最好藉口嗎？　　若說是他的自殺是爲了家事，因爲他的太太於十八閱月前逝世，老母最近經手術割治之後又體氣衰弱，加之這决的誣蔑，於是就使他「深覺毫無生趣」了。事情是實情，一個有血有肉的人總有他的情感，但自殺是否是事情的解央呢？何况一個戰士，是祗有殺人和被殺的資格，而沒有自殺的權利的。　　然而薩郞格羅氏却自殺了，在這點上他顯出了他的軟弱，而失去了戰士的雄姿。　　說起殺人，在國爭中自然是免不了的，但是總得以光明態度出之，若是弄些花巧，造些謠言，靠冷箭中傷來博勝利，則卽使靠了冷箭誣蔑而使對方跌倒幾個，但勝利却還是渺茫的，理由很明白，冷箭是祗能躱在陰暗的角落裏，偸偸地射幾箭的，要明目張膽的衝鋒陷陣，則便用不到它。而勝利的决定，則是在衝錄陷陣的肉搏中才能見分曉。　　冷箭有時自然也能射倒幾個人，但被射傷者大都是弱者，他們中了一箭之後，便應聲倒地，無法再起，卽使祗傷了一些皮膚，傷愈之後，也終以爲自己是成了殘廢。强者則使不同，暗箭卽使中了，也會裏創再戰的，並且因爲冷箭更增加了他的憤怒，戰起來便格外奮不顧身。　　弱者和强者所不同的，大概也就在這些地方。「賽金花」觀感  莫思　　我高興的看到「賽金花」上演了。　　「賽金花」所取的題材雖是三十六年前的事實，因爲這事實里邊恰恰是同目前差不多的有外敵的侵略，有漢奸賣國，我們就不覺得這是歷史劇，而是我們這一代的。自然，在看到了大紅大紫的官員向洋大人低首下氣的醜態一笑之餘，我們是不能忽略了劇作者拿賽金花的對我們的啟示：「替漢奸救的國是沒有用的！」　　像這樣含有國防意義的劇本，在這民族的危機到了生死存亡的關頭的目前，把它上演是很必要的。　　對「賽金花」的編製，我覺得劇作者是把它電影化」了的。是那麼樣的，一幕幕的開展。要是在銀幕上，的確可予導演者以手注輕鬆簡潔的帮助。但，在舞臺上就不同了。幕數越多，佈景等化</p>
<p>Page 20</p>
<p>費也多。而每慕換佈景的時間的隔離，將會使觀衆對演出打斷精神。我以爲，把幕數劃得過多，並不是很好的辦法。　　其實，第三塲戲是可以節略的。這塲慕前的戲原祗暴露聯軍的强暴。但這一點，在第四塲里是可以加幾句對白加以說明的。　　演出對原作沒有什麽改變。祗是前面的一段電影是沒有的。用了幻燈片映出「一九〇〇年（光緒二十六年庚子）在北京」如「悲劇時代中的一個喜劇的挿畫」的字幕，砲聲，在幕前燃放黃烟。幕敗。這樣做，雖然沒有原來的好，却也聊勝於無。　　對於整個的演出，我覺得他們最努力的是在服裝，佈景，道具上邊。能够做到這樣，的確是很不容易的。　　也許是因爲籌演的時間太忽促吧！每一個演員的台詞都是沒有唸熟。臺詞太生，會使對白沒有情感而妨碍了演技，會影響到調子的快慢。　　爲了臺詞太生的綠故，那舞臺上東西，就顯得沒有情感了。是的，有些對白也能引起臺下的笑聲，然而這楚臺詞本身的成功。如：「皇上祗准咱們唸書，唸書之外什麼也不會。」「奴才祗會叩頭，跟洋大人叩頭！」王瑩師賽金花　　這一個缺點對劇本所受影響最大的是第五塲戲。李鴻章和瓦德齊的談判是很重要的，然而顯不出緊張的空氣來。　　導演者處理得最好的是第七塲。那幕戲的舞臺面就有北方的味兒。如孫三上塲報吿賽二爺無法營救。孫三拿包裹要走，在門帘縫里給我們看到同顧媽的爭奪。孫三逃出，聽見馬呌，然後再說出連賽二爺的鐵皮靑都給帶走了。賽金花先在門外呌顧媽後上塲。都是很好的。較差的是第三塲，忽忽忙忙的，使觀衆捉不住一點影子。　　演員們在演技上確有不少是可取的。但，受了唸詞不熟的牽制，就無盡量的發展。王瑩的賽金花在第七塲是相當好的。可惜給夏霞的活潑的動作，生動的臺詞掩蓋了。在第四塲，賽金花見瓦德齊時欠熱情一點，太冷了似乎不够吸住瓦德齊。我總覺得王瑩的動作，不能表現賽金花那樣機警的人物的。金山的李鴻章在演技上說是不壞的。但氣魄還不够，第五幕導演給了他最好的位置，他盡量做戲，可是他是太賣弄了一點。梅熹在第一塲是很不錯的。其他，那些由銀幕走到舞臺的，王獻齋的臺詞欠自然，張翼的身體是够好，聲音欠洪亮些，孫敏的戲還合身份。　　化裝是很成功的。　　可是，燈光太壞了。頂燈欠亮，脚燈沒有，旁光太弱，而且動搖，樓上的二盞Sport　Light時明時暗，移東移西，不知何故？　　舞臺管理也欠有組織。　　這次的演出，總感到是成熟的藝術之果。螃蟹  羅鬱　　「那决搗房子的是爲什麽呢？像你們這班人都會上了手嗎？」我在那狹長的小堤上走在他底身後這樣問着他。他像很感觸似的，回轉了頭，眉毛提起很高。　　「你也許不大相信，是的，那時候不像平常，我們一家去一個人，好像壯起了膽量，什麽也不懼了。」他又去看前方脚下的堤背，又接着說：一楊景泰有一所瓦房——你在天津也找不到那樣堂皇的瓦房，烟囪飾着　鈴，活像座小閣，院裏有彫木的走廊和方磚的鋪道，房舍比樓房還要高大，可是現在牠變成碎磚了。　　他注意那魚港內內斜陽的典奮而跳蹤着的魚。他接着講：　　「人們衝進地窖去。宅中的女人一邊哭啼，一邊攔護着，她們也會哀求，哀求也是沒用。人們扯出來許多皮衣服，華貴得耀眼，這使我們都想着自身的襤褸，就索性把牠們撕成了碎片：人們又搜出厚厚的賬本，這不錯，是塗着漁人的血的東西，也被憤怒的人們撕得粉碎了。大家都想報仇，想把這個包魚稅的暴發戶搗死。」　　他說完沒有回頭，仍向前走着。我們都在想些有關的事。　　我看着一團團的白沫被微濤捲到脚邊來，幾隻海鷗飛翔在晚風裏，倩美的互喚着。長堤如一個豐滿的丁字，直伸到河面去，那里有船桅的密林，夾着炊霧。我看着他——我底表哥底寬大的肩背，那挽着籃子的大手，那是十分有力氣的。我又看到他底低着的頭，知道他內心的冲激：那或是說：「表弟，你還有錢。」想到這個，我覺得這沉思是不妙。於是問起關於捐稅的事。　　他又帶了一種新約期望講起捐稅，他說年年添加新的捐稅，已經超過一百元了，如果魚稱成立，大家就活不下去了，他又說一隻船不能打許多魚；就是打了好網，也是到營口去抵賬，又說船如果不加修理，要常常鬧岔。連人的性命都是不敢去想：我傾聽着這些，沉入祖母底故事裏去了，那船睡倒在一邊上如飛魚一般行進着，巨風摑着金星，是一種恐怖而且慘淡的夜色。　　河面上船都進口了，桅和帆在兩岸擠攏着，密集的船身，是深褐色的，雖然古舊，却富有童話的深味。在平闊的河口那面，漂着一行白帆。我們坐在對河面的堤上等那有着白色的帆桅。　　表哥把褲管挽了上去，把鞋脫了。他底大的身軀和兩腿顯得格外高長。他底臉頰是勁瘦的。那眼光里有着超冷的沉靜，十分耐心地望着那隻白帆，牠在向夕陽閃着親禮。　　「噲！有大蝦嗎？洪亮的聲音在傍晚空氣中蕩來蕩去，很久才聽到回聲：「沒，沒有大蝦：有幾隻螃蟹呵。」　　「你看××鬼子的鐵舶，專門收買大蝦，又到河口去撒網。」　　於是他一跳跳進泥漿裏去，舉着籃子踏過去。船已拋了錨。我見他兩手攀着船舷，把脚在河水中攪了幾下，扳上去了。　　有幾個小孩在爲了爭買新魚，蝦，在大聲地講道理。　　過了一會，他跑來了，提着幾隻螃蟹。那鬼靑色的螃蟹，互相用甲尖刺碰着，長的指爪起勁地爬着，聽到港的水聲，像陶醉了似地吐着口沫。　　一小時後，和姑母一家坐在院裏吃起煮熟的螃蟹。九月晚的南風帶過來海上的呼颸，感覺有另一個境域我不曾思會而煩惱着。憂鬱  路直　　我像走進春天的森林裏去，耳邊滿是鳥聲，眼前滿是顏色，可楚我更憂鬱了。更憂鬱了，因爲我聽到的是憂鬱的嘆息，看到的，是憂鬱和飢餓的眼睛，常我向我的四周定神考察的時候。　　春天離開我們多遠？不，我們的希望還不至於這麽侈奢，要悅耳的聲音，悅目的色彩。我們要的只是一刻的休息，就剎那的時問都行，容許我們從憂鬱的圍困中脫出，靜靜的躺一下，舐一舐生活所給予的創傷，撫一撫滴着血的創口。可是希望雖然低，低得和沒有希望相仿，而我們也得不到這低微的希望實現。是愚蠢嗎？假若生活在憂鬱中的原因是愚蠢，我將咀咒那些聰　的人類——從同類的身上榨　血，榨着汁，或是用甜蜜的手段從同類的手中攫得他所需</p>

<p>要的東西。這些行爲假若是聰明，那麼人類應該不能誇奬那些哲八留下的話，不能將那些哲人的言行作爲標榜。呵！我多愚蠢，這就證四了我的愚蠢是事實，人類所以誇獎，標榜那些死去了的人，正和用覊勒的管束一匹野馬相同來管束另一批被　爲愚蠢的實際楚樸實的人吧！　　我流轉了幾省的地區，遇到幾萬的人羣，這裏有我所熟知的，亦有我匆匆一會的，我都看出了他們心底憂鬱，爲着生活，爲一點小的希望，掙扎着，掙扎着，最後發生那固有的一聲沉長的嘆息，又埋着頭去生活了。我若楚遇到這些生活在憂鬱中的人。　　人爲什麽老是這一副臉相的？我不能相信我楚被生在憂鬱的國土上，因爲我曾經爲了證明別的國土會勝過我這故國而流浪到被稱爲柔美的島國去，可是亦一樣的，那裏的入，我所能過到的，也有一副拉長了的憂鬱的臉相，拉長了的憂鬱的嘆息。我不禁這樣想着，原來這世界到處是憂鬱的，人是被生下爲了來憂鬱的。　　我這肯定却不能不被推翻，當我聽到說仳界上確是有一塊憂鬱所不能漫長的土地，有一個曾經在長期憂鬱中生活而終於將憂鬱驅出的國家。我找着證明，卽使自那國土飛來的塵點那麽大的事實。的確，我不能不修整我的肯定，，人不是有了憂鬱而生長着的，而憂鬱者却楚爲了愚蠢—然而這愚蠢不是每一個入的愚蠢，而是憂鬱的人羣的愚蠢，他們爲什麽讓那些浪費者，侈奢者，奪掠自己手中的歡樂的人存在着呢！　　我得了啟示，得了最大的允許，我將再進行滿是憂鬱的嘆息，憂鬱的眼睛之羣裏去，而說：我們不應該憂鬱，我們的憂鬱是不合理的！插音節目特別節目　　明社　　交通（一三〇〇）下午四時半至五時一刻　　愛的留連（明朗）人面桃花（明民）鸞鳳引（明輝）天倫歌（明萍）風雨歸舟（明律）新女性（明文）飄泊者（明儉）開路先鋒（明輝）新　鳳陽歌（明文）　　自强歌詠社　　交通（一三〇〇）下午五時一刻至三刻　　立志歌（全體）鐵血歌（朱影）領袖歌（張俊）出發歌（張炯抗敵歌（顧蟾）準備歌（唐皓）好大的西北風（秋影）中國新軍人（全體）　　英雄社　　交通（三三〇〇）下午五時三刻至六時半　　銀漢慶星（曼雄）（曼豪）娥眉月（曼英）舟中曲（曼琪）偉大的手（莉琳）好妹妹（曼雄）光明之路（曼豪）愛情是什麼（經濟）話劇　　電送劇社　　佛音（九八〇）下午九時至十時　　娜拉　　永遠依附着男性而生存的女性們，千數百年來，被那「從父從夫從子」的三從四德的遺毒，以至於今日。女性，永遠是被壓迫着的女性，她們隨着這流毒，隨着男性支配，一任擺佈！　　由於歷來女性的生活不能獨立的積習，一輩虛榮是尚，意志薄弱的她們，也不在生產上着想了！塗抹裝飾，以爲悅己者容，妖豔冶蕩算是媚人工具；尤其是都市的女性，更有種種不可思議的穢行。——因此「玩偶」兩字，便無形中給一般不自覺的女性承受着。　　電霞社平劇　　交通（一三〇〇）下午十時至十一時半　　坐宮（張了良）掃雪打碗（湯起鳳）武家坡（薛玉良）（撤平甫）南陽關（汪緋祖）金鎖記（劉香齋）歌唱　　現代歌劇社　　李樹德（九四〇）下午三時至四時　　丁香山（莉莉）漁光曲（儷影）因爲你（曼琪）飄泊者（陳筠）春又來（徐燕）鴛鴦怨（莉莉）（廿二日）送別（儷影）安眠（徐燕）國花（曼琪）回憶（陳筠）安慰（莉莉）努力（儷影）　　上海歌劇社　　華興（二六〇）下午六時半至八時　　（一）月圓花妤（二）南海美人（三）在歡曲（四）因爲你太美（五）鸞鳳和嗚（六）馬妮娜（七）囚犯歌（八）給歌郎（九）城市之光（十）民族之光（十）（一）迷途的羔羊（十）（二）自由之花（十）（三）湖上之歌（十）（四）夜半的私語　　（廿二日）（一）夜花園裏（二）風雨歸舟（三）長相思（四）從軍別愛（五）鴿子歌（六）茉莉思鄕（七）贊美曲（八）快樂之鄕（九）永久別離我去（十）醉花興酒（十）（一）浮雲掩月（十）（二）知音之愛（十）（三）一身都是愛（十）（四）永遠親愛　　中國歌劇社　　新新（七八〇）下午七時至八時　　愛的新生（黃韻）開心歌（余林）茶山情歌（秋玲）天下太平歌（白璐）一個女明星（秋琍）似水流年（黃韻）父母子女（飛霞）（飛虹）　　（廿二日落花時節（余林）梅蘭曲（黃韻）人間仙子（白璐）天上人間（秋玲）人市塲（秋琍）新漁光曲（飛霞）（飛虹）維他賜保命歌（全體）父歸（黃韻）　　爵士歌劇社　　華興（一二六〇）九時五分至九時五十分　　我要你的一切（張俊）今夜曲（姚莉）薔薇處處開（姚英）航空救國（露茜）心的變遷（張俊）（姚莉）狂歡曲（姚英）琴挑（露茜）　　（廿二日）回憶慈母曲（姚莉）勞苦農工（姚英）可愛的夢鄉（露茜）窮富姻緣（張俊）開始的一吻（姚莉）燕帶春來（姚英）齦色的凄凉（露茜）薔薇之蕊（張俊）明日節目　　毛執中美術講習座　　李樹德（九四〇）上午七時至八時半　　（一）兒童新生活（二）敎人體解剖及透視學（三）奏樂（四）敎中西畫譜　　藝鳴社　　華東（一三六〇）上午九時至十時　　慰勞歌（　瑾）妹　我怪你（藝蕙）黎明前進曲（藝娜）贊美男士曲（蓓霞）醉臥沙塲（藝華）天倫（藝芳）小鸚哥（藝虹）（藝琪）航空救國（裕震）　願意（藝瑾）畢業歌（全體）　　明社　　航業（一一八〇）上午九時半至十時半　　天倫（明輝）娘子軍（明萍）春之花（明律）從軍別愛（明文）回憶（明儉）敎我如何不想她（明朗）鋤頭舞歌（明民）摩登戀愛（明　）芭蕉枼上詩（明文）戰地之花（明律）和平歌（全體）　　鮑明珊　口琴敎授及演奏　　友聯（八八〇）上午十時半至十一時半　　敎授「正式口琴吹奏法」第三章第一節口琴的樂謠，（二）「正式口琴吹奏法」第十一章第　節高低半音奏法，演奏（一）賣花娘（二）拉巴洛馬（三）風流寡婦（四）命也運也　　自强社莉社合組　　大陸（六二〇）中午十二時三刻至一時半　　（一）狼山謠（二）吿別南洋（三）救亡進行曲（四）迷途的羔羊（五）桃李刧（六）睡的贊美（七）國花（八）凱歌（九）早行樂（十）慰勞歌（十）（一）休息五分鐘（十）（二）R　se　Merry　（十）（三）自由神（十）（四）目然的孩子　　蓓蕾歌劇團　　亞東（七六〇）下午二時至三時　　舟中四（白燕）夜　裏（飛霞）鳳求凰（飛虹）空中音樂（王潔）賣油條（金影）迷途的羔羊（佩君）咪咪貓（蓓紅）城市之光（張明宗）蘇三不要哭（玲玲）吹泡泡（斐斐）大路（全體）　　琍琍業餘聲樂社　　敦本（八〇〇）下午二時三刻至三時三刻　　月光光（麗麗）鐵蹄下的歌女（純美）梅娘曲（儷珍）下瓊樓（麗麗）你是我的生命綫（純美）愛情似玫瑰（儷珍）畢業歌（全體）狼山謠（麗麗）　　李樹德堂傳音科　　李樹德（九四〇）下午三時至四時　　圍成記　　在某决某一個城中受到外侮迫急，外兵一次次地摧殘時全城市民，都遭遇了重大的酷刧。　　劇中的老趙他的妻子和鄰居老太太老王這幾個人也是城中市民之羣，老趙的妻子和鄰婦他的兒子和許多同樣命邋的民衆先後都死在敵機炸彈之下。在敵人團攻月餘下之孤城，正亟亟可危時，他們覺悟了以前的懦怯，明白了「先有國後有家」都奮勇地跑上城去抵抗敵人！　　勝利！終是屬於我們的了。　　稚鳴社　　交通（一三〇〇）下午四時半至五時一刻　　浮雲掩月（沈瑛）路柳牆花（沈玲）祝你晚安（柴瑟）娘子軍歌（斐君）永遠親愛（瑛瑛）你的一笑（陳萍）摩登戀愛（沈玲）睡的贊美（沈瑛）　　吼音團歌唱　　東陸（六四〇）下午四時三刻起　　總理紀念歌（全體）軍歌（胡軍）救亡進行曲（全體）勇士凱歌（浩英）示威歌（全體）自强歌（玉琳）勞慟歌（浩民）（浩英）自由神（全體）大地行軍曲（胡軍）義勇軍進行曲（全體）　　幼童播音團　　東陸（六四〇）下午四時三刻至五時半　　贊美勇士（耕娣）姊妹花（琴珍）父母子女（鳳娟）自然孩子（　琴）賣油條（琴珍）漁村之歌（耕娣）漁光曲（銀琍）歡樂之歌（麗娟）迷途羔羊（全體）航空救國（芳恩）　　飛聲歌唱社　　交通（一三〇〇）五時一刻至五時三刻　　大地行軍曲（合唱）迷途的羔羊（徐徐領唱）鳳陽歌（馮玲）天倫歌（范珓）慰勞歌（殷瑩）戰歌（合唱）當兵爲保民（合唱）　　靑年歌詠團　　中西（一〇四〇）下午五時三刻至六時半</p>

<h3 id="e1">武川 My Defense Line Front: Yesterday, Mongol Puppet Cavalry Discovered; Garrison Troops All Awaiting the Enemy in Trenches; Xinghe Bandits Defeated and Retreating; Bandit Group Disguised as Civilians Disturbing the Rear of the Ping Sui Railway; Wang Ying's Bandit Troops Transferred Back to the Rear of Shangdu for Reorganization <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Collected Telegram: On the afternoon of the 10th, Mongol puppet cavalry were discovered in front of my defense line in Wuchuan. The main force of the puppet troops consists of the First and Second Armies of Bao Yueqing and Zhuo Shishai's Mongol Autonomous Army, numbering approximately 4,000. Each soldier has two horses and carries lasso poles. It is predicted that there will be fighting on the evening of the 20th. The Zeng Yibu troops of my garrison, the [unclear] brigade, all went down into the trenches on the morning of the 20th, calmly awaiting the enemy. (Special Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Collected Telegram from Ning: On the night of the 19th, a section of the railway track between Guancun and Suji stations on the Ping Sui Railway in Fengzhen was destroyed. Upon receiving the report, our military headquarters immediately ordered armored vehicles to be dispatched to search along the route. It is reported that several bandit groups disguised as civilians are disturbing the rear of our Ping Sui Railway, causing unease among our troops. (Special Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Collected Telegram from Ning: As of the morning of the 20th, the Wuchuan area remains calm. The puppet troops of Bao Yueqing and Zhuo Shishai's units in Bailingmiao have not launched an attack. The enemy facing Xinghe are currently the troops of Li Shouxin and Zhang Wanqing. Wang Ying's bandit troops, having failed to capture the Honggetu position in a sudden attack and suffering more than half losses, have been transferred back to the rear of Shangdu for reorganization. The bandit troops this time are using heavy firepower, with 3.5-inch caliber field guns being the most numerous, with each infantry company owning several. They are using incendiary bombs to attack our Nanhaogou trenches, causing fires in nearby village houses. (Special Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) Zhang Wanzuo used more than ten heavy artillery pieces and six tanks on the evening of the 19th to attack Xinghe from Nanhaogou. The battle was fierce, with four consecutive attacks all repelled by the Sui army. The enemy retreated more than ten li from the position on the 20th, forcibly taking away able-bodied men from various villages during the retreat to replenish their depleted ranks. Zhang's troops have suffered more than 300 casualties in recent days. Furthermore, the bandit troops of Li, Wang, and others in Shangdu were defeated by the Sui army on the 19th and have withdrawn from the positions west of Shangdu. Wang and the Jehol cavalry bandit generals will be transferred to northern Sui to join forces with Mongol troops to attack Wuchuan and Guyang, aiming to enter the Hetao area and achieve a three-sided encirclement from the east, west, and north. On the 20th, the bridge at Suji Station between Jining and Fengzhen was bombed by aircraft, delaying the second Ping Sui train for more than four hours. According to reliable information, more than 1,000 members of Wang Ying's special task force were killed by the Sui army in Hongge'ertu on the 18th, and the rest were disarmed. The puppet regiment commander Chang Ziyi was killed in action. (Special Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Collected Telegram from Ning: From the 15th to the 20th, the Sui border battles have generally shown that the puppet troops rely mainly on cavalry, but they are not skilled in their use. Each time they decide to attack, our troops lie in wait in trenches or bunkers, not moving until they approach within 300 meters, at which point they unleash concentrated firepower, inflicting heavy blows on the bandit cavalry. Although there are military officers from a certain country directing them and aircraft providing cover, air and ground coordination is still lacking. Furthermore, the puppet troops are mostly hastily formed and lack experience. When one is hit by a bullet, the rest flee, fearing they will be too late. In the battles of the past few days, we have consistently defeated the many with the few. A certain commander once made a bold statement, saying that if no [unclear] troops join, no matter how the bandit troops attack, they will not be able to invade an inch of our territory. (Special Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to related sources, the bandit troops in eastern Sui have recently suffered repeated defeats at the hands of our forces. Their target of attack has definitely shifted to northern Sui. The bandit troops' strategy for attacking Sui is roughly divided into three steps: (1) a policy of terror propaganda; (2) a policy of poisoning and bloodshed; (3) a scorched-earth policy of burning. Currently, the policies of terror and poisoning have both been defeated. The bandits also know that it will be difficult to succeed. In recent days, they have been bombing Jining with aircraft and burning villages in various places, attempting to implement the third policy, but ultimately, due to the calm response of the national army, they will ultimately be unable to realize their delusions. (Telegram from the Central News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to related sources, the bandit troops in eastern Sui sent two aircraft to Hongge'ertu on the 19th for low-altitude reconnaissance. They were fired upon by our troops and both were shot down. The bandit troops know that their strength is far inferior to ours and plan to change their disruptive tactics to northern Sui. (Telegram from the Central News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday, the front lines in Suiyuan were relatively peaceful. Approximately 1,000 "Manchu"-Mongol troops attacked the Suiyuan garrison in the Xinghe area, but were ultimately repelled, suffering several casualties. (Reuters Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The U.S. Consul General in Tianjin, Mr. Hureid, went to Suiyuan to inspect the evacuation of overseas Chinese and visited Fu Zuoyi and Bi. He left Suiyuan on the 18th, arrived in Beiping on the 19th, and reported to Johnson on the morning of the 20th before returning to Tianjin. (Special Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The World Red Swastika Society, due to the outbreak of the Sui eastern incident, is in urgent need of relief. After several days of deliberation, it was decided that the Tianjin and Beijing branches would jointly organize a large relief team, with President Su Jinglin as the team leader. He will lead more than 20 team members, including doctors, and will prepare medicines, equipment, and other items. They are scheduled to depart for the front lines at the end of the month for relief efforts. Furthermore, the Shaanxi branch of the Society has received a request from the Sui branch and has already organized a relief team on the 15th to depart for the front lines. (Special Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>Statement by the Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson:</p>
<h3 id="e2">Dealing with the Sui Incident: China Has Full Freedom; Even If Song Zheyuan Participates in Defending Against Bandit Troops, the Japanese Government Has No Reason to Oppose <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) When answering questions from foreign journalists today, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson made a clearer statement regarding the Japanese government's attitude towards the situation in Suiyuan. He said, "The fighting in eastern Suiyuan is purely a domestic matter of China within its own territory and will not affect the safety of Manchuria. The Chinese government has full freedom to deal with this situation. Even if Song Zheyuan participates in defending against the Inner Mongolian army, the Japanese government feels there is no reason to oppose it." When asked where the Inner Mongolian army's aircraft, tanks, and artillery came from, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson replied that if they could not manufacture such military equipment themselves, they could import it from abroad, just as Outer Mongolia imports military equipment from the Soviet Union.

<p>(Beiping) When meeting with reporters at noon on the 20th, Imai said that the Japanese side had received the official document from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordering overseas Chinese in Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Suiyuan to evacuate. However, since there are few Japanese businessmen and even fewer tourists in these four provinces, it seems unnecessary to relay this document. The Japanese side is not very clear about the bandit situation in Suiyuan, and no Japanese troops are participating in the fighting. Although there has been no significant progress in Sino-Japanese negotiations recently, there has also been no deterioration. (Telegram from the Central News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) When meeting with foreign reporters today, the Japanese military attaché Imai was very skilled at arguing when reporters asked about Japan's position on the Suiyuan incident. He said that the Suiyuan incident is China's internal affair. When someone asked what attitude Japan would take if the Suiyuan army drove away the "Manchu"-Mongol army and entered Chahar, Imai replied, "Because Chahar Province is adjacent to North China and 'Manchukuo', Japan is currently considering the situation in Inner Mongolia." When someone further asked if "the Japanese believe that Japan has vital interests in Chahar Province," Imai replied, "Yes, we do have vital interests in Chahar Province, so we are currently watching the situation with extreme caution." A reporter told Imai, "The Suiyuan Chinese army has seized many bombs dropped by aircraft, some of which have Japanese markings." Imai replied that he knew from the newspapers that bombs had been dropped, but he personally believed that this was just a rumor. Another reporter asked if there were any Japanese in the Mongol army. Imai replied that he had heard nothing about it. (Reuters Telegram, 20th)</p>

He is expected to return to Nanjing to report after a short stay. (Special Telegram, 20th)</p>

However, in any case, the Sino-Japanese negotiations are about to reach their final stage. When mentioning the situation in Suiyuan, Arita reportedly expressed the view that although it is an internal problem of China and has nothing to do with Japan, if the unrest spreads and directly affects the rights and interests of Japan and Manchuria, or Japan's task of maintaining peace and order in Manchuria, the Japanese government cannot stand idly by.

<h3 id="e11">Spokesperson of the Central Propaganda Department Issues Statement on the Current Situation; Key to Sino-Japanese Negotiations Lies Entirely with the Japanese Side; Only Way to Deal with Bandit and Puppet Invasions in Eastern Suiyuan Is to Counterattack Head-On; Attention Should Be Paid to the Organization and Management of Public Donations <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Recently, puppet bandits have invaded Suiyuan, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. Public sentiment is fervent. The spokesperson of the Central Propaganda Department issued a statement to reporters on the 20th regarding the current situation, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) We must recognize that an independent country must have full freedom to exercise its national sovereignty, both internally and externally. In short, its sovereignty must be absolute internally and independent externally. The current problems in China may seem complicated, but if we use this principle as a guide to understand them, they are actually simple. China has now completed unification, and government orders are being implemented throughout the country. Only the compatriots in a very small bandit area in the Northwest have not yet escaped the suffering of being in dire straits. The organization, slogans, and background of these bandits have been deeply recognized by the people. There is no doubt that they are disrupting national unification and hindering national survival. Furthermore, puppet bandit troops have invaded internally. What are their intentions and background? This is also obvious. There is no difference in their infringement of national sovereignty and harm to the government's prestige. Therefore, regardless of whether they are called bandits, traitors, thieves, or rebels, their harm is the same, and they are our enemies. Standing on the position of the country and the government, we will not tolerate this and will definitely do our best to suppress and exterminate them. This has already become the national policy of today. (2) The Sino-Japanese negotiations currently underway in Nanjing have lasted for more than two months. The government has repeatedly stated its position through our diplomatic authorities, namely that the principles of adjusting national relations are equality and rationality. Recently, both domestic and international public opinion has stated that the Chinese government and diplomatic authorities have fulfilled their greatest responsibilities. It is hoped that the Japanese side can fully recognize China's position and ensure that the Chinese people can improve relations between the two countries through the adjustment and negotiation of Sino-Japanese national relations and achieve the desire to abandon suspicion and restore friendship. This kind of argument can represent the psychology of the Chinese people and also reflects the common rational judgment of the international community. Today, the key to Sino-Japanese negotiations lies entirely with the Japanese side. Recently, puppet bandits have launched a large-scale internal invasion, and the border atmosphere is becoming increasingly urgent. National emotions are running high, and the enthusiasm for the military affairs of Sui and Chahar is far greater than that for the ongoing Sino-Japanese negotiations. This difference in attitude is excellent material for the neighboring country to study.</p>
<p>(3) After the Suiyuan situation became tense, national emotions ran high, and the attitude was extremely calm and resolute. The interior is like this, and the border provinces are also like this. Because today's problem in Sui and Chahar is very simple and clear: those who invade, whether they are puppets, bandits, or any other force, are all enemies of the country and the nation who cannot be tolerated under the same sky. The only way to deal with this is to counterattack head-on and to exterminate them completely. Local border officials have made clear statements on this, and the central authorities have even clearer guidance. The attitude is clear and there is no room for hesitation or research. Therefore, in the past few days, military reports from the front lines show that although the bandits have repeatedly launched fierce attacks, they have all been defeated miserably. This is due to the bravery of the soldiers on the front lines and also relies on the central coordination and command, which has created the current situation of internal and external unity and mutual support from top to bottom. If the people of the whole country can further recognize this fact and take a calm and resolute attitude, with orderly and unified steps, trust the government, and jointly overcome national difficulties, the suppression and extermination of bandits and rebels will not require divination.</p>
<p>(4) After the Sui and Chahar alerts were issued, the spiritual encouragement given by the people of the whole country to the soldiers on the front lines had a significant effect. In recent days, students and civilians in various places have launched donation campaigns to comfort the soldiers on the front lines, which is very enthusiastic and passionate. This is truly the most valuable phenomenon of popular support and the most optimistic point for the future of the country. However, the government has its own plans for providing aid to the military operations to suppress the bandits, and both sides must pay attention to the organization and management of donations from the people of the whole country. Otherwise, if they are scattered and mixed, although the momentary courage is commendable, the result will be of little practical benefit. Past events can serve as a warning. Therefore, the Headquarters previously decided on the "Contribute One Day's Income" campaign and formulated implementation measures, which were published in national newspapers. The day before yesterday, we further revised and supplemented the measures for the donation campaign to comfort the soldiers in Suiyuan and published them in newspapers. We deeply hope that patriotic people will be able to contribute to the country in accordance with these measures. (Telegram from the Central News Agency, 20th)</p>

(Special Telegram, 20th)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Song Ziwen met with the Chinese and Western press at the Guangdong Bank at 10:30 AM on the 20th, speaking for 40 minutes. He said that his mission in coming to the South was to open the Guangdong Bank, meet with friends in Guangdong, and take the opportunity to return to Hainan Island for a visit. The exchange rate between Guangdong currency and silver dollars is very fair, and it is incomprehensible why Guangdong merchants are opposed to it. The loans from the United Kingdom are paid in goods, not cash. China welcomes foreign investment under the principle of not undermining sovereignty. The Northwest has been developed by the government and has achieved success. Guangdong has a very promising future and can serve as the rear of the central government. The connection between the Guangdong-Hankou and Guangzhou-Kowloon railways has nothing to do with him, so he has not studied it. Song is scheduled to visit the Governor of Hong Kong at noon on the 21st and go to Guangdong Province on the 24th. Li, Bai, and Huang sent a telegram to Song, welcoming him to Guangxi for inspection. (Special Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) At 9 AM on the 20th, Song Ziwen inspected the operations of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank. At 10 AM, he held a reception for the Chinese and Western press at the Guangdong Bank and made a speech, stating that his visit was to preside over the opening ceremony of the Guangdong Bank. After the event, he will go to Guangdong Province to visit old friends. The economy of Guangdong Province has made considerable progress, and if it can continue its efforts, the future is limitless. Hainan Island is his hometown, and he will visit it if he has time and plan development matters. Since the implementation of China's legal tender policy, it has achieved remarkable results. Regarding the issue of utilizing foreign capital, we of course welcome foreign investment under the principle of not losing sovereignty in order to develop domestic industries.

<p>(Hong Kong) The Hong Kong banking community held a banquet for Song Ziwen at the Hong Kong Hotel at 8 PM on the 20th. (Telegram from the Central News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Song Ziwen, Chairman of the National Economic Council, is expected to arrive in Guangzhou on the 25th of this month, and local people are preparing to give him a warm welcome. This will be the first time that Song has returned to South China since he left Guangzhou with the Northern Expeditionary Army ten years ago. The main purpose of his visit to Hong Kong and Guangdong is related to the restoration and reorganization of the Guangdong Bank. However, people here deeply believe that Song will also assist the provincial authorities in rectifying Guangdong's finances, putting them on a solid foundation, and realizing several great revival plans in the province. According to Song Ziliang, in an interview with Reuters today, the central government has decided to replace the Guangdong currency with the national currency in the near future. He also said that since the tax on opium and gambling has been abolished, the province's tax revenue this year will inevitably be greatly reduced. However, with the assistance of the central government, the provincial budget can remain balanced. At the same time, the Department of Finance will seek to develop new sources of revenue without increasing the burden on the people. When the interviewer asked about the discount for exchanging Guangdong banknotes for central banknotes, Song replied that the central government is currently considering a perfect and fair method to ensure that the people of Guangdong Province do not suffer excessively.

<p>(Tianjin) At 6 PM on the 20th, over 400 men of the 4th Battalion of the 2nd District of the 3rd Regiment of the Fake Hebei-Chahar Peace Preservation Corps from Changli, led by Japanese Kempeitai officer Sakurai, advisor to the regiment headquarters Hirai, and Korean commander Han, boarded passenger and freight train number 44 on the Tang-Yu line to Tangshan for reorganization. The lower-ranking officers of this unit were formerly under the command of regiment commander Li Haitian and, incited by Li, planned a mutiny. After boarding, claiming they were unwilling to go to Tangshan for reorganization, several lower-ranking officers coerced the entire unit, seized the driver, and continued past every station. They forced the train to stop at Wuali Station, between Guye and Tangshan, forcibly halted it, searched the passengers, looted their belongings, cut the railway telegraph and telephone wires, drove railway workers and police into the station building, and imprisoned Sakurai, Hirai, and Commander Han in the freight depot. Upon receiving the report, the Fake Peace Preservation Corps of Tangshan rushed to intercept them. After 8 PM, gun and cannon fire was heard nearby, indicating that the two sides had made contact. However, the exact situation remains unclear. It is said that passengers are still trapped on the train. Traffic out of Shanhaiguan and to Shenyang on the 20th night will be blocked; we await further news before resuming operations. At 11 PM, the Beining Railway Bureau received a report that the train driver had been released, but the train was not allowed to depart. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) General Supervisor Chiang issued a circular telegram to provincial and municipal governments on the 20th, stating: "The deadline for prohibiting opium has arrived. From the 26th year onward, all those who manufacture, transport, or smoke opium will be sentenced to death. However, there are still many ignorant and foolish people in various regions who have failed to repent and reform. The reason for this is largely due to the fact that official propaganda work has failed to penetrate the people deeply enough to awaken them. Within the 25th year, provincial, municipal, and county governments, together with local party, government, military, academic, self-governing bodies, various institutions, and impartial persons such as district and baojia heads, should all participate in organizing anti-opium assemblies. In accordance with the notice previously issued by the General Anti-Opium Association, propaganda should be carried out as quickly and extensively as possible. The methods of propaganda are as follows: (1) Concise and alarming announcements and slogans; (2) Clear illustrations; (3) Assemblies, open-air parades, and lectures; (4) Beating gongs and notifying households one by one. The above four points should be implemented uniformly in urban and rural areas alike. The telegram should be acted upon immediately, with daily teams dispatched to spread propaganda everywhere. The work should be completed and the assemblies dissolved by the end of December of the 25th year. Obey and implement accordingly, and report back. Chiang Chung-cheng, seal of opium prohibition.

<h3 id="e22">The Ministry of Finance Replies by Telegram to the Zhejiang Public Association Regarding the Daishan Salt Issue <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance replied by telegram to the Zhejiang Public Association, stating that since the Daishan incident occurred, the various issues raised by salt farmers' representatives Liu Linzhao and others have been carefully investigated. Specific instructions are hereby issued: Building salt mounds is an important policy for the national reorganization of salt production sites. With the implementation of the new salt law imminent, fundamental construction is actively underway in various districts. Daishan is an important salt production area in Zhejiang, and preparations have not yet begun, which is considered an urgent matter. However, enclosing areas for salt evaporation ponds and limiting the time for mound construction may be inconvenient for the people. The Liang-Zhe Salt Transport Commissioner has reported that the engineering office is doing its best to avoid the location of the salt mound base and that the time for salt production will be adjusted to avoid hindering the work of the salt farmers. The previous difficulties have been resolved. As for the high cost of salt production, improvements should be made to the quality of the salt itself, which has nothing to do with the mound construction. Therefore, the construction of salt mounds cannot be delayed, and there are no obstacles to the implementation. Regarding the use of salt for fishing, the government has already specially reduced the tax rate to facilitate competition with foreigners. It is therefore necessary to prevent the mixing of this salt with heavily taxed table salt to avoid loss of national revenue. Therefore, there are regulations for changing the color of salt for fishing. However, the methods of changing the color vary in different regions. This Ministry has jointly established a fisheries and salt experiment area with the Ministry of Industry to study and implement new methods in order to promote applicable methods. The color change of fishing salt in the Daishan area is still in the trial period. How to improve it in the future and strive for convenience, or whether to formulate strict management measures to avoid the hassle of salt color change, are all under evaluation and discussion. The measures for changing the color of fishing salt are still under consideration. In addition to ordering the Liang-Zhe Salt Transport Commissioner, it is hoped that this information will be forwarded to the salt farmers' representatives. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) In the assassination case, after the three suspects Yu Likui, Zhou Shiping, and Hu Dahai were extradited from Hong Kong to Nanjing, the Fifth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court immediately dispatched Prosecutor Luo Renji to Nanjing for investigation. Besides the aforementioned three suspects, the investigation also involved ten suspects, including Yang Sheng Sun, Yang Qin Jia, Guo Ziping, Hu Changping, Zhang Guoping, Zhu Xinyuan, and the female suspect Xu Yaoying. After more than a month of continuous interrogation, the investigation has now concluded. As a result of the investigation, it was found that there was insufficient evidence against the suspects Yang Sheng Sun, Yang Qin Jia, and Zhu Xinyuan, and they should be dismissed from prosecution according to the law. As for the suspect Guo Yuping, he was arrested for hiding Yang Sheng Sun and Yang Qin Jia. The prosecutor, believing that the crime committed by the suspect was that of harboring criminals, transferred him to the Capital District Court for further investigation. Since the charges against Yang Sheng Sun and Yang Qin Jia were dismissed due to insufficient evidence, the crime of Guo Yuping is also difficult to establish. The Capital District Court prosecutor also decided to dismiss the charges. Since all four suspects had been dismissed from prosecution by the prosecutor, the Capital District Court Detention Center ordered the release of each suspect on bail. The four suspects were released on bail yesterday. As for the other suspects, Yu Likui, Zhou Shiping, Hu Dahai, Hu Changping, Zhang Guoping, and the female suspect Xu Yaoying, the prosecutor believed that they were suspected of having committed crimes and decided to file a public prosecution with the Fifth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for endangering the Republic of China. Prosecutor Luo Renji, having completed his mission, is scheduled to return to Zhenjiang within a few days to report on his duties. It is said that when the case is tried in the future, the presiding judge will be Wu Yuheng, the presiding judge of the case, and Si Wen, the judge in charge of the Jin Shuren case, will be transferred to serve as the presiding judge, and Judge Guan Kai will be appointed as the associate judge. Wu and others will set a date to come to Nanjing after the prosecutor files the indictment and will still hold a public trial in the Capital District Court. (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e34">Wang Yongbin Discusses Judicial Affairs in Five Provinces <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Yongbin recently completed an inspection of judicial affairs in various provinces, including Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Anhui. He returned to Beijing from Wuhu on the 20th, and senior officials of the Ministry of Justice welcomed him. After entering the city, Wang immediately returned to the Ministry of Justice to rest. When reporters inquired about the inspection, Wang said that judicial affairs in the provinces have made significant progress. Since the central government reorganized judicial affairs in Guangdong Province, it has strictly ordered the unification of laws and regulations, rectified official discipline, and created a new atmosphere. It has also implemented a three-level, three-trial system. Although the reorganization period has been short, the results are already visible. Judicial officials in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces are generally able to implement laws and regulations and work hard to clear backlogged cases. New prisons are also under construction in each province. Since the implementation of the Provisional Regulations for the Simplification of Prison Procedures, the number of ordinary criminal offenders has been greatly reduced. However, the number of prisoners detained by military agencies is still too high, and prisons are still crowded. It is still necessary to consult with military agencies to resolve this issue. Every time I go to a province, I urge the active establishment of county judicial offices as a foundation for the future widespread establishment of local courts. According to the current situation, this plan can be implemented, because county magistrates in various provinces hope to establish local courts as soon as possible so that they can concentrate on political affairs. After the reorganization of county court revenues by the Ministry of Justice, there has been an increase, and the goal of self-sufficiency is not far off. This proves that breaking the entrenched habit of not separating administrative and judicial powers is not difficult. Based on the observations made during this trip, it is my opinion that we have previously focused too much on higher-level judicial agencies and neglected to rectify lower-level judicial agencies, which is a mistake. Because the first-level courts and county prisons are most closely related to the interests of the people, and their facilities are the least perfect, the people feel extremely painful. In the future, the Ministry will devote all its efforts to rectifying the first-level courts and county prisons. He also discussed the issue of establishing a special district court in Kowloon, saying that the situation in Kowloon is different from that in Hong Kong. Kowloon is only a leased territory and has not been ceded. However, the people there often appeal to the Hong Kong court, which is detrimental to sovereignty. Therefore, I went to inspect the area and consulted with Diao Zuqian to establish a court in accordance with the precedent of the Shanghai Special District Court to handle appeals from the local people. In the future, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice will jointly carry out this work. (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>— Jin Yong</p>
<p>Blessed Land of Yushan</p>
<p>If you have been to Changshu, you will surely see a large wooden plaque at the foot of Yushan Mountain with the four characters "虞山福地" (Yushan Blessed Land) written on it.</p>
<p>Changshu is a prosperous area in Jiangsu Province, indeed worthy of the two words "blessed land." Weng Tonghe of the Qing Dynasty was from Changshu, so at that time there were eight satires on Li Hongzhang and Weng Tonghe, making a couplet saying: "The Prime Minister of Hefei makes the world thin, and the Minister of Agriculture Changshu makes the world desolate." Although the desolation of the world is not because of Changshu's constant good harvests, it is certainly true that Changshu is a good place.</p>
<p>Changshu County is located in the center of four townships, with Yushan Mountain to the northwest. Part of the mountain area extends into the city, so the ancients had the famous line "Ten li of green mountains, half entering the city."</p>
<p>Yushan Mountain is not very large. If you are a brisk walker, one day is enough for you to explore its depths and discover its beauty. In Changshu, you will feel what mountain spirituality and water beauty are all about. If you don't believe it, you can stand on the road to Jianmen (the most magnificent place in Yushan, with steep cliffs and a small path), and look out. You will see clear blue lake water, lush misty trees, and squares of fields planted with very orderly and vibrant crops, a yellow patch, a green patch, and a blue patch. Seeing this will not only make you feel refreshed, but it will also make you want to crush these crops, mash them up, and eat them with the fertile mud. You will say, "It is truly a 'Yushan Blessed Land'!"</p>
<p>Three Types of Bloodsuckers in the Countryside</p>
<p>In Changshu, there are three types of people who suck the blood and flesh of farmers. Relying on their inherent or newly acquired power, they parasitize this blessed land and harm the farmers, ruthlessly swallowing up the fertile land and yellow, green, and blue crops that the farmers own.</p>
<p>Changshu is famous for producing rice, but the areas that exclusively grow rice are limited to the southeast townships because the rivers and ports are wide and the land is fertile, truly worthy of being called a land of fish and rice. As for the northwest townships, half of them grow rice and half grow cotton. The rice is only enough for self-sufficiency, and most of the cotton is sold. Only the sandbar area, all of which is sandy land silted up from the Yangtze River, is planted with cotton nine-tenths of the time and rice one-tenth of the time, forming another crop area.</p>
<p>However, the prosperous farmland is not owned by the farmers, and the abundant products are not possessed by the farmers. The farmers work hard all year round, but what they gain is exploited layer upon layer by people who do not work.</p>
<p>In Changshu, farmland is concentrated in the hands of landlords. In my estimation, less than four-tenths of the farmers are self-cultivating. There are even fewer self-cultivating farmers in the southeast townships. Originally, landlords own many fields and can easily exploit the farmers, but the general landlords of Changshu have an additional layer of power and take on another form, which is that they mostly possess a kind of political power. Many of the large landlords have served as officials, so the bigger the official, the more land they have; the more land one has, the easier it is to become an official.</p>
<p>Large landlords often employ many rent collectors and accountants, who directly exercise power and exploit the farmers. The farmers cannot calculate and have no choice but to let them profit from it. When farmers pay rent with rice, they must put a few more liters in each bag, because the landlord's measures are comparatively larger.</p>
<p>The government serves them. Every autumn and winter, one can see the yamen runners running around in the four townships, and groups of poor farmers following them to the city, either pawning things to pay rent or facing lawsuits.</p>
<p>The second type of bloodsucker is the tax collector. Not only do they directly extort an extra one or two cents from the farmers' taxes, but it is said that the greatest gain is still from exploiting those who have land without proof or grain without roots.</p>
<p>After the land survey, this chronic problem may be eliminated, but tens of thousands of (estimated by some to be around 100,000) coins every year are the blood and sweat of the farmers, yet they have been eaten by them for generations.</p>
<p>The third type of bloodsucker seems to be a specialty of the counties along the river because there are often silted sandy lands along the Yangtze River that can be reclaimed. Before the reclamation, there are a group of people called "sand bullies" who report to the county that they have thousands or tens of thousands of acres of sandy land in a certain place and are willing to pay a few cents per acre so that the sand bullies can enjoy the benefits as the sandy land slowly accumulates. In order to not spend too much money and reap great profits, the sand bullies compete very fiercely. Whenever a piece of sandy land is to be enclosed, it is necessary to gather hundreds or thousands of hardworking farmers to compete with each other to enclose the sandy land. The side with the greater power will enclose more land. As a result, there are often armed fights, and injuries and deaths are common.</p>
<p>After the sand bullies use the farmers to enclose the sandy land, they either sell it to the farmers, making a profit of fifty or sixty yuan on a capital of only ten yuan. The farmers do not get any benefit at all. Or they rent it to the farmers to cultivate. Because the area is close to the river, it is prone to floods and typhoons, so when the sand bullies rent the land to the farmers, they first require the farmers to pay the so-called "board rent." In the event of crop failures, the farmers are fully responsible. The farmers create them into rich people, and they immediately come to absorb the remaining blood in their veins.</p>
<h3 id="e43">The Future of World Silver Prices <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Fortunately</p>
<p>Since the United States began large-scale purchases of silver in 1933, world silver prices have gradually risen. By May 1935, due to the American monopoly in the world silver market, silver prices began to plummet. It was not until mid-January of this year that they stabilized. From that time until the beginning of this month, silver prices in New York did not fluctuate greatly. In the history of the world silver market, this can be considered the longest period of silver price stability. However, recently, world silver prices have changed again. From November 6th, silver prices in London and Mumbai suddenly rose sharply. From the 9th, the price of foreign silver in New York followed suit. In the past few days, silver prices in various places seem to have slightly declined, but they have not yet fallen to the level of silver prices during the stable period before this month.</p>
<p>To understand why silver prices have suddenly risen this time, one must first recognize that the United States occupies a dominant position in the current world silver market. This can be proven with statistics. In 1934, the total world silver production reached 180 million ounces. The total exports of silver-using countries reached 260 million ounces, totaling 440 million ounces. Among them, the U.S. government purchased 310 million ounces. In 1935, it purchased even more, not only swallowing up the world's total silver production of 210 million ounces and speculators' stockpiles of 160 million ounces, but also absorbing a large portion of the exports of silver-using countries, totaling more than 540 million ounces. For the current year up to the end of September, according to a report from the U.S. Department of Commerce, the silver absorbed by the United States was worth a huge 150 million U.S. dollars. At 45 cents per ounce, the amount of silver totaled 330 million ounces. This is already much more than the amount absorbed in the entire year of 1934.</p>
<p>Since the United States is currently the only largest customer in the world for silver, speculators in free silver markets no longer seem to have the possibility of manipulating silver prices. We can clearly see that the current silver price is merely a market price set by the U.S. government for individual countries, and it differs in nature from the market price of a free silver market. World silver can no longer be regarded as an ordinary commodity.</p>
<p>This kind of silver market phenomenon not only makes it impossible for world silver speculators to operate, but more importantly, it makes those countries that use silver as a reserve for international payments feel considerable hidden anxieties. Although China has now broken away from the silver standard, it still uses silver as a currency reserve. Under the current circumstances, only if we can find appropriate adjustment methods in international payments, and only if we can live without "capital exports," will our currency value not be seriously affected by changes in silver prices.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the tragic accident of the collapse of the Osarizawa mining poison sedimentation pond, according to a telegram from the Akita Prefectural Governor to the Minister of Home Affairs on the 20th, the number of households affected has reached more than 300. The number of bodies discovered so far is 54. However, there are still those floating away, and others buried at the same time as their houses, numbering over 300. In the future, when excavating corpses, it may be necessary to request military assistance. The number of households affected is 300, with an average of 5 family members per household, the number of victims reaches 1,500. Currently, only 75 people have been confirmed to be alive. The others are unknown. Furthermore, the bodies of the victims are under highly toxic mud, so excavation will still take two or three days. (20th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>Osarizawa: Mr. Osato, the director of the Hanawa-cho Hospital, said to reporters at the scene of the accident that the number of deaths seems to exceed 1,000. Underneath this mud, there are still hundreds of dead bodies. Because the reservoir contains mining poison, many victims drank the water, making it difficult to sustain life. (20th, same dispatch)</p>
<p>Osarizawa: After the collapse of the mining poison sedimentation pond, the six villages outside Osarizawa have become a tragic toxic mud street, completely submerged by red-black toxic mud, with an extremely foul odor, creating a desolate scene that is heartbreaking. Three hundred households are buried under six to twenty feet of sulfurized mud, resulting in the sacrifice of over a thousand people. Fathers search for their sons, wives seek their husbands, their cries of grief are unbearable to hear. Entering the green toxic mud is like taking poison, making it difficult to preserve life. Contact with the skin causes immediate corrosion. Its toxicity is evident. Currently, rescuers from various places are arriving successively to provide assistance, and excavation teams are also tearfully excavating, searching for bodies. (20th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>Akita: The embankment of Nakanosawa, at the summit of the Osarizawa Mine in Kazuno County, Akita Prefecture, suddenly collapsed at around 4:00 this morning. Over one hundred houses of the mine company's employees and workers below were swept into the Yoneshiro River by the muddy torrent, creating a living hell. After the accident, the fire brigade rang bells to summon members and the self-defense force to engage in rescue work. Because houses swept away blocked the flow of the Yoneshiro River, causing it to overflow, the surrounding area became a swamp. Rescue teams saved only a dozen or so people, with hundreds more unable to be helped. (20th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>Hanawa: After the collapse of the reservoir at the Osarizawa Mine, 136 houses in Uribata Village, 80 houses in Sasagoya, 50 houses in Shinhotta, and 70 houses in other places in the downstream area, totaling 336 households, were all swept away by the flood. Of the 1,300 residents, only 18 were rescued. 22 bodies have been discovered, with the rest missing. Their survival is almost hopeless. After the floodwaters passed, only a few houses remained in the affected villages, and the surrounding area has become a sea of mud. Houses and furniture are floating on the surface of the Yoneshiro River, and bodies are found everywhere, a very tragic sight. (20th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>Hanawa: The tragic accident of the collapse of the reservoir at the Osarizawa Mine occurred before dawn, making rescue completely impossible. More than a thousand nearby residents were buried alive in the mud and water. By 10:30 this morning, over 300 bodies had been discovered upstream of the Yoneshiro River. After receiving the report, the Akita Prefectural Police Department mobilized all police officers, and the police stations in Kazuno and Kitaakita also dispatched police officers and firefighters to engage in rescue efforts. The Akita branch hospital of the Red Cross Society and officials from the prefectural health department have also dispatched numerous doctors and nurses to provide assistance.

<p>(Tokyo) French aviator Mr. Chappy took off from Hong Kong at 5:25 yesterday morning, completing the final stage of his long-distance flight between Paris and Tokyo. Unexpectedly, news arrived that Mr. Chappy's plane had crashed and shattered 65 miles from Nagasaki. Mr. Chappy suffered a head injury and a broken leg. Although the situation is quite serious, hope for survival remains. Mr. Chappy's flight was intended to win the 400,000 franc prize offered by the aviation department for a long-distance flight between Paris and Tokyo. Since departing from Paris, the journey had been extremely smooth. After taking off from Hong Kong yesterday morning and arriving northwest of Nagasaki, the aircraft suddenly encountered an obstacle and was forced to land. The area happened to be a mountain 1,000 meters high. The plane crashed into the mountain peak and shattered completely. The time was 4:30 yesterday afternoon, but no one noticed at the time. It was not until four hours later that a charcoal burner found it. He carried Mr. Chappy to the foot of the mountain and administered emergency treatment. It is said that Mr. Chappy was unconscious when he was rescued. Many people had already gathered at the Tokyo airfield to welcome Mr. Chappy. When the plane was overdue, they knew that something must have happened en route. The initial news of Mr. Chappy's accident was transmitted from the police station to Moji at 1:40 this morning and immediately relayed to Tokyo. The charcoal burner who rescued Mr. Chappy heard a loud noise when the plane crashed, but couldn't find it until four hours later, as the mountain forest was very dense and searching was extremely difficult. (20th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Moji: Mr. Chappy set out from Paris and flew 15,000 kilometers. It is a pity that his grand plan failed at the last step. His flight time for the 14,000 kilometers was 78 hours, which is an astonishing record. (20th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Paris) News of Mr. Chappy's injury reached Paris on the night of the 19th, causing national shock due to the unexpected event. Although Mr. Chappy was unable to win the 300,000 franc prize, the French government has recognized Mr. Chappy's bravery and achievements. Therefore, it was decided on the night of the 19th to award Mr. Chappy the Fourth Class Medal as a reward for his efforts. (20th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>Fukuoka: Since French aviator Mr. Chappy departed from Hong Kong at 5:25 yesterday morning, news has been scarce. However, at around 8:00 p.m. on the 19th, villagers from Sefuri Village, Kanzaki County, Saga Prefecture, Japan, discovered the plane crashed in the Sefuri Mountains. The aircraft body was severely damaged. They immediately notified the police station. Police Inspector Yoshida led doctors and interpreters to provide immediate rescue. It is said that the plane crashed in the mountains at around 3:00 p.m. on the 19th. Mr. Chappy suffered injuries to his head and thigh, but they are not life-threatening. (20th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>Sefuri Village: Kuboyama in Sefuri Village, where Mr. Chappy's plane crashed, is crowded with prefectural hall staff, military police, police officers, and newspaper reporters arriving by car. Villagers, regardless of age or gender, are all comforting and caring for Mr. Chappy and discussing the circumstances of Mr. Chappy's accident. Therefore, Mr. Chappy's ability to preserve his life can be called a miracle. If it had been delayed by two hours, he might have lost his life due to excessive bleeding or intolerance to the severe cold. Furthermore, Mr. Chappy's condition is improving well, so he will be transferred to the prefectural hospital or Kyushu Imperial University Hospital for treatment within a day or two. (20th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>Mount Sefuri: Mr. Chappy, who failed at the decisive point, is currently being cared for by Mr. Teshima Shigeru at the Onshi Clinic in Kuboyama, Sefuri Village, Kanzaki County, Saga Prefecture, at the foot of Mount Sefuri. When reporters drove to visit him, they saw Mr. Chappy sleeping on a temporary bed, wearing a pure wool undershirt stained with blood. Due to pain and fatigue, he kept groaning. Regarding the events at the time of the accident, he intermittently told reporters: "I arrived in Hong Kong the night before. Due to the strong wind, I couldn't depart. I departed before sunrise at 2:00 a.m. on the 19th. En route, I encountered fierce headwinds. Reaching the south of Kyushu consumed a lot of time, resulting in insufficient fuel to reach Tokyo. At 1:00 p.m. on the 19th, I arrived at Mount Sefuri and realized that there was still enough fuel. I planned to land once to replenish fuel and then depart again. Knowing that Fukuoka had a landing field, I tried my best to search, but due to the dense fog, visibility was poor. I planned to pass over Mount Sefuri when a sudden storm blew the plane down. It was not a mechanical failure that caused the crash. It was due to being attacked by the storm at the end, right above the mountain peak. Due to the fog, I couldn't see even close by. The plane had already overturned. There was no time to level it out. Finally, I collided with the mountain. It is a pity that I couldn't achieve my goal, which was only three hours away. However, it is truly unbelievable that I survived," he said. After recounting his experience, he added that his mother in France must be worried about his accident and asked to send a telegram to his mother to tell her that his injuries were not severe.

<p>(Geneva) Japan today submitted a plan to the League of Nations Mandate Committee to establish an air route between Japan and its mandated islands in the Pacific. Although Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, it still submits reports to the Mandate Committee every year because its mandated islands in the South Pacific are still under its mandate. This aviation plan is quite important because Japan's route will pass through the Pan American Airways Pacific route and the steamship route between the United States and the Philippines and Hawaii. Furthermore, it is also of great military significance. As for Japan's explanation, it is said that this air route is necessary to increase administrative efficiency and inspect fish movements.

However, Mr. Woodring does not support increasing the current number of divisions, as none of them are close to wartime strength. (20th, Reuters)</p>

<p>Barcelona: The German consul here led all the personnel of the consulate and 50 German overseas Chinese today, leaving here by the torpedo boat "Albatross". This move is a direct result of Germany's recognition of the Nationalist government. The Italian consul also led many members of the consulate and overseas Chinese to leave the country on the warships "Volare Bello" and the merchant ship "Tevere". (19th, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is reported that Italy has no intention of withdrawing from the Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War as a result of recognizing the government of General Franco, and denies that Italy intends to blockade the Spanish ports still in the hands of the Western government.

It is reported that several Italian warships are currently anchored in Barcelona and other ports controlled by the Spanish government to protect Italian interests. (20th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The British government today instructed Sir Chilton, the British ambassador to Spain, to propose a compromise to General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the rebel army, for the blockade of the Spanish ports, advocating the establishment of a safe zone outside the port of Barcelona. The Foreign Office had already warned the Spanish government and the rebel army in August that Britain would not tolerate interference with British shipping three miles off the coast.

In short, unless and until the Spanish Nationalist army is recognized as a belligerent party, its right to inspect British merchant ships at sea will not be recognized by the British government.

<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Eden made a statement in the House of Commons today regarding the announcement by General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Nationalist Army, of his intention to blockade Barcelona. Eden stated that the Burgos Nationalist government intends to use all its strength to obstruct, and even destroy, the port of Barcelona because the government army's import of military supplies, bullets, tanks, airplanes, and poison gas shells are all centered on the port of Barcelona. The Nationalist army has warned ships of all countries not to enter the port for the time being to avoid unnecessary losses, and has further advised overseas Chinese from all countries to leave Barcelona. Eden also said that various countries have requested the Nationalist army to guarantee the safety of navigation at designated anchorage points in Barcelona. The British government has requested that a reasonable time limit be given to allow British overseas Chinese to withdraw in an orderly manner. Currently, the British government has notified the British Consul General in Barcelona and the British naval authorities in the Mediterranean of General Franco's statement. (20th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian recently published a report stating that large quantities of military supplies from Sweden will soon be shipped from the port of Hamburg in that country to Spain to supply the Nationalist army. It stated, "German military supplies are being transported to Spain by sea, while airplanes are departing directly from the Böblingen area near Stuttgart, either flying directly to that country or flying over France at night, or via Austria and Italy. In addition to shipping large quantities of military supplies in the past week, Germany has also dispatched volunteer troops to Spain to assist in combat (the two tank vehicle teams of soldiers who went to join recently are one example). The monthly salary for these volunteer troops is very good, with ordinary soldiers receiving 500 marks and military assistants receiving 700 marks. Therefore, there is a high degree of enthusiasm for enlisting and departing. In addition, German air force pilots regard Spain as a good place to practice aerial combat, and many volunteer to go to work for the Nationalist army." The German government is extremely secretive about the export of military supplies. Recently, because a radio station in a certain country broadcast news that Germany had shipped aircraft engines to Spain, several members of the National Socialist Party were detained on suspicion of leaking the news.

<p>Madrid: After the extremely fierce air raids on the central area of ​​Western Beijing last night, the residents of the city are all waiting for the Nationalist army to attack again today. During last night's air raid, a total of 15 three-engine Junkers bombers participated. The extent of the damage was not ascertained until dawn. Many houses were still burning, and many corpses were piled up in the ruins. A large number of civilians were bombed to death. The buildings of the Army Department, the Post Office, and the Bank of Spain were all targets of the Nationalist army's bombardment. There was a huge crater in front of the Post Office, formed by a bomb, which was as deep as six feet. During the Nationalist army's air raid, in addition to the above-mentioned bombers, there were also many fighter planes. A countless number of incendiary bombs and aerial torpedoes were dropped in the city center. Residents along Anton Martin Street all took refuge in cellars during the air raid. It is reported that they were all buried alive in the soil because the houses were destroyed and the ground collapsed. This morning, thousands of civilians fled from their destroyed houses in a state of extreme distress. According to the Reuters special correspondent stationed in the Nationalist army, the air raids by the Nationalist army were immediately followed by a major air battle. The intensity of the situation was unprecedented since the outbreak of the civil war. The correspondent claimed that although the Nationalist army's attacking aircraft had 21 bombers and 24 escorts, when each aircraft completed its bombing and was preparing to fly back, 18 aircraft from the government army side suddenly rose into the air to pursue them. At the same time, the troops of both sides fighting on the ground temporarily stopped firing, looking up at the results of the fierce air battle. Later, because the Nationalist army's bombers safely escaped, the accompanying fighter planes also stopped fighting and flew back one after another. After the air battle stopped, the land battle resumed. (20th, Reuters)</p>

<p>Avila, Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent Tao Sibida: The Nationalist Army has now occupied all the government army positions in the northern district of Madrid and is currently engaged in street fighting with the government army. Panic among the people of Madrid has reached an extreme. Since the Nationalist Army launched its offensive today, the situation in the surrounding areas has completely changed. According to reports, the Nationalist Army began its attack on Madrid this morning, dividing into four routes: (1) General Mola's troops are responsible for the northern front; (2) Three columns led by Colonel Tejado, Colonel Bartolomé, and Colonel Esgamez are attacking in the northwest suburbs; (3) Two columns led by Colonel Barón and Colonel Asensio are responsible for the western front; (4) Colonel De la and Colonel Monasterio are attacking in the south. Nationalist Army aircraft simultaneously bombed the city center, destroying the Interior Ministry (located in the Sun Plaza) office. By 10:00 AM, more than 100 houses in the area between the Segovia Bridge and the Toledo Bridge in the southwest had been occupied by the Nationalist Army. (Havas Dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>Madrid, Thirteen Nationalist Army aircraft flew over the capital again at 4:00 PM today, bombing the city center indiscriminately. The devastation was even more severe than before. In many places, houses were penetrated from the roof to the foundation. A bomb landed in the open space in front of the General Post Office, creating a hole two meters deep, uprooting two large trees, and shattering glass windows in the surrounding area. Another bomb landed in front of the Interior Ministry, destroying a large clock. The area around our branch office was the worst hit, with no houses within 100 meters left intact. Corpses were strewn among the rubble. Refugees on Anton Martin Street were buried alive in cellars. The bombed areas were filled with thick smoke. Thousands of residents, after this catastrophe, abandoned their homes and fled. People are living in constant fear, saying that they do not know what Madrid will look like in a few days. (Havas Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Madrid, Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent Auchinate: It rained continuously in the city last night, and the sky was cloudy, so rebel planes were unable to come and bomb, resulting in a quiet night. This is the first time since the fighting broke out in the suburbs. Refugees in the city, unable to bear the suffering of the bombing, are leaving in droves, carrying their belongings with handcarts or shoulder poles. The defending army has requisitioned many houses in recent days to accommodate refugees. Citizens whose homes have been destroyed and have nowhere to live can go to these shelters. In small rooms that were originally only suitable for one family, more than 50 refugees are now housed. Enemy planes are bombing various areas of the city in shifts, and hardly any area is spared, so the refugee shelters often have to be moved several times a day to avoid the bombing, which is also a hardship.

It is also said that although the rebels have been attacking continuously in the past 48 hours, the Model Prison and the Montana Barracks have not fallen. The rebels' claim that they have occupied these two places is not true. It is believed that the buildings in those two places are currently on fire. (Reuters Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Madrid, After the capital was repeatedly bombed with incendiary bombs by Nationalist Army aircraft, it is still burning today. According to an Associated Press correspondent reporting from a mile outside the city, the houses bombed last night are still emitting black smoke, and the fires at the Montana Barracks and the Alba Palace have not been completely extinguished. A large fire has also broken out near the telephone bureau.

<p>(London) After the notice from the Spanish Nationalist Army government regarding the closure of the port of Barcelona was delivered here, political figures were extremely uneasy, believing that Britain was concerned about two things: first, how to protect British interests when the Catalan coast is blockaded, and second, the general political repercussions caused by this move. Regarding the protection of British interests, the British destroyer "Gallant" is currently in the port of Barcelona, responsible for protecting the safety of British nationals in the port. The government has instructed the ship that if the port is bombarded, it should order British nationals to board the ship for refuge. In addition, the British cruiser "Arethusa" is currently sailing from Mallorca (one of the Balearic Islands belonging to Spain) to the port of Barcelona. Furthermore, British merchant ships will also be instructed by the government not to sail into the blockade area. As for the political aspect, political figures believe that the British government has not yet decided on its attitude, but the various departments of the Foreign Office are currently studying whether to issue a warning to the leader of the Spanish Nationalist Army government. Political figures also believe that what should be clarified first is whether the Nationalist Army government can actually implement the blockade. If not, and only implements a partial blockade, then its nature is extremely dangerous, and the British government will naturally oppose it. In any case, Britain currently does not recognize the two sides as belligerent entities, and therefore does not recognize the Nationalist Army authorities as having the legitimate right to declare a blockade. In short, politically, Britain will not make a decision until it has consulted with the signatory countries of the Non-Intervention Agreement, especially the French government. This consultation has not yet begun. (Havas Dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Eden announced in the House of Commons today the British government's attitude towards the recognition by Germany and Italy of the government established by Spanish rebel leader General Franco. The entire House listened attentively. Opposition leader Attlee rose and said that, judging from the Foreign Secretary's declaration, the British government had no intention of recognizing General Franco and his belligerent state. The Foreign Secretary said that the House should be able to distinguish between recognizing a belligerent state and recognizing any side as the Spanish government. He did not wish to say anything more on these two points. Former Naval Secretary and Labour Party member Alexander asked about reports that General Franco would blockade and bombard the port of Barcelona. The Foreign Secretary replied that Britain's position would remain in accordance with the policy established after the start of the Spanish Civil War. As for the protection of British shipping, British warships would follow the usual international practice in such incidents to defend the legitimate interests of British people. Communist Party member Gallagher asked whether Germany and Italy's announcement of recognition of the government established by General Franco was intended to undermine the Non-Intervention Agreement. The Foreign Secretary replied, "Of course not. Even if one side or the other is recognized as the government, the non-intervention policy regarding the supply of weapons can still proceed unhindered. As for undermining the agreement, there are other countries that are more deserving of blame than Germany and Italy." The Foreign Secretary continued that the information he had received on the matter was now in the hands of the members of the Non-Intervention Agreement Adjustment Committee, and there was no reason to say that the actions of the Soviet Union would render the work of the Non-Intervention Committee ineffective. (Reuters Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden replied to questions from several members of parliament in the House of Commons, issuing a declaration stating, "Regarding the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, the actions of several other national governments (implicitly referring to the Soviet Union and Mexico) are worthy of criticism, and are more so than those of Germany and Italy.

Heaven did not pity, and Wuyang was called away. White clouds for a thousand years, yellow cranes soar again. Red banners write inscriptions, and glorious robes honor you. Flowers of orchids and artemisia are displayed, and wine is offered in small cups of thatch. With respect and sacrifice, the smoke is sad and lingering. Accept this offering." (2) National Government Eulogy: "On November 19, 25th year of the Republic of China, Lin Sen, Chairman of the National Government, sends Lu Zhu, acting Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, to respectfully offer this sacrifice to the spirit of Mr. Changqing, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, saying: When the country is in trouble, we always think of the people's support. Only you are loyal, a model for many scholars. Assisting in military affairs, with grand plans and ambitions, establishing this new country, your achievements are even more significant. The vast Yangtze and Han rivers, the record of the southern country, you are like Shao Bo, reaching the highest principles. Relying on you as a shield, we looked forward to saving the country together. Heaven did not spare you, and you suffered a sudden death. The pillars and beams have collapsed, which is not only a personal pain. Your legacy still exists, and who will share the administration? The country has high rewards, and only you deserve them. We respectfully offer this mourning sacrifice, and may your spirit rest here. Accept this offering." (3) President Chiang's Eulogy: "On November 19, 25th year of the Republic of China, Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government and concurrently Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, respectfully offers this clear wine and delicacies to the spirit of the late Mr. Yang Changqing, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, saying: The new country has just been established, and we were relying on your excellent assistance. You have left us, and how can we not be sad? You embodied virtue, and your brilliance shone forth. You participated in national affairs early on, and later commanded the army. You went to the front lines and deployed troops in the Jiangdian region. You had brilliant plans and stood out independently. We hoped to work together to save the country, and I dared to serve as your subordinate. You were loyal, clear, and diligent, and your achievements were presented well. You excelled in handling affairs and were capable in all aspects. You responded to all tasks and worked diligently from dawn to dusk. You examined the truth and went straight to the point. You were as straight as a line, not afraid of being slandered, and not self-congratulatory. Knowing your sincerity, you worked hard for the country. The Yangtze and Han rivers in the south, your command was exemplary. Your reputation spread with your political achievements, and the people were happy to obey your orders. With extraordinary plans and meritorious service, you suddenly suffered a cruel attack. Thinking of your ambition and loyalty, you were unparalleled. The country has lost its pillar, and this is not only a personal sorrow. Cherishing your efforts, your plans will shine forever. The nine heavens can be reached, but tears cannot be stopped. Your merits will be rewarded and your burial will be grand. The mountains and peaks stand tall, praising your lofty character. Your reputation for integrity and love will be admired for a thousand years. I offer this cup of wine to you, and I am filled with sadness in the wind. Alas, alas, alas, accept this offering." (4) Provincial Government Committee Eulogy: On November 19, 25th year of the Republic of China, Lu Zhu, Meng Guangpeng, Jia Shiyi, Cheng Qibao, Liu Shoupeng, Li Shucheng, Fan Xiji, Wu Guozhen, Director of the Security Department Ding Bingquan, Deputy Director Jin Jutang, and all staff members of the Hubei Provincial Government respectfully offer this sacrifice to the spirit of the late Chairman Yang, saying: Mr. Yang, lofty and upright, soaring alone, sharp and capable, wise and resolute, establishing government in the land of Chu, continuing the legacy of the sages, with virtue comparable to Yang Hu, and strictness comparable to Tao Kan. From the beginning of his administration, he first clarified official standards, removing abuses and promoting benefits. Gentle but not submissive, strong but not overbearing, diligently seeking the people's welfare, and advancing without hesitation. Reforming the mind and changing customs, with unflinching sound arguments, elucidating the arts of governance, and creating a golden rule. Guiding and showing the way to colleagues, a mentor to all. When his ambition was about to be fulfilled, he followed these precepts. But like an orchid that is fragrant and broken, or a jade that is tight and broken, things are jealous of firmness and fragrance, and people dislike brightness and purity. The world's praise and criticism, what do they mean to you? Your illustrious achievements have already been immortalized. The days we spent together are still memorable. Zichan has no successors, who will enrich the town? With this we endure our sorrow, respectfully offer this sacrifice, pour the wine, and gaze with tears and sighs. Accept this offering."

<p>All circles in Baoshan County have scheduled a conference for all circles to support Suiyuan's suppression of bandits and soldiers on the 20th at the county government conference hall. Many important proposals were decided, including fundraising to comfort the front lines and passing a resolution to comfort the soldiers at the front. In addition, prisoners in Baoshan County Prison and Detention Center also voluntarily fasted for one day on the 20th, requesting the county government to transfer the money saved to the front lines.</p>

<p>The entire group of inmates in this county's prison, alarmed by the daily urgency of the national crisis and the siege of Suiyuan by the puppet bandits, believe that as fellow citizens, they have a duty to save the nation during this critical time of survival. They voluntarily stopped eating for one day to transfer the funds to donate to the government for purchasing aircraft, thereby expressing their patriotic enthusiasm. After submitting the request to the prison warden, who then forwarded it to the county government for approval, the county government issued an order stating that the inmates, despite being imprisoned, still had enthusiastic patriotism and were willing to fast to donate for the purchase of aircraft, which was commendable. However, considering that the inmates' daily nutrition was not sufficient, fasting for one day would be detrimental to their health, so they were advised to reduce their food in installments to make up for one day's worth of food. The inmates were delighted after receiving the order and wished to fast for one day on the 21st of this month instead of reducing their food in installments. However, the prison warden, out of concern for the inmates' health, purchased rice and cooked porridge at his own expense to feed the inmates on that day.</p>

<p>In Xiliu Lane in Taifu Township near Anzhen in the seventh district of the county, there are more than ten households, mostly farmers. The other night around 8 p.m., a fire suddenly broke out at the home of Hua A'er due to carelessness. By the time it was discovered, it had already broken through the roof and spread rapidly, making it difficult to extinguish. It spread to the homes of neighbors Li A'wu, Shi Genpei, and others. The fire brigades of the east and west sections of Anzhen heard the alarm and immediately drove to the scene to bravely fight the fire. It took about two hours to extinguish the fire, but all the houses in the village had been reduced to ashes. When the fire was raging, a newborn baby in a farmer's household was buried in the fire because it was too late to rescue it. For a time, the cries of sorrow and grief spread across the fields, a scene too tragic to witness. Afterwards, all the villagers were homeless, hungry, and cold, making it difficult to survive. The Baozhang of Fenghu Lane, Gu Xueli, and others took the initiative to propose raising donations for relief to temporarily sustain their lives.</p>

<p>According to confidential reports, the Jiangdu Anti-Smuggling Team received information that water bandits were entrenched in Erjiangying and other places in the third district. Deputy Captain Zhang Qingan led detectives Zhai Jingwu, Xue Zhiming, and eight others to investigate and suppress the bandits. They discovered multiple bandit ships successively at the mouth of the river in Sanjiangying and at the Shuangjiangkou area in Yangzhou County. The ships raised their sails and attempted to escape. The deputy captain led the detectives to hire boats to pursue them. The bandits resisted on the river, and the two sides fought for several hours. When the distance between them was close, the deputy captain led the detectives to bravely jump onto the bandit ships. They confiscated three box cannons, twenty-six bullets, and three carbines with twelve rows of bullets from the bandits. One of the carbines was thrown into the river by the bandits. The bandits Sun Yonglong, Jin Guangren, Zhang Qicai, Zhou Jinniu, Ye Dechang, Zhou Jinfa, Gao Hongxi, Zhou Wanqing, Zhou Changjin, Dai Xiaoshizi, and Sun Baofu, a total of eleven people, along with eleven bandit ships, thirteen family members of the bandits (women), and a dozen boys and girls, were all captured. That night, they were handed over to Wang Ming, the captain of the He Kou Zhuang Ding Reserve Team, to assist in guarding them. This morning (19th), they were transported by the Longzhen bus of the Yangzhou Company to Huoqiao. In addition to handing over the bandit ships and bandit family members to the Huoqiao Security Regiment for guarding, the deputy captain and eleven bandit criminals, five rifles, and bullets were transported by car from Huoqiao to Yangzhou for interrogation to determine how to handle the case.</p>

<p>Mr. Shen Sifang, General Manager of Wuhu Mingyuan Electrical Company, believes that the movement of contributing one day to the country is the bounden duty of citizens to save the country and survive. If all compatriots across the country can contribute one day's income to the country to enrich national defense construction, the effect will be significant. Recently, the National Federation of Private Electrical Industries held its eighth member representative conference in Beijing. Mr. Shen made a temporary motion requesting the national electrical industry to jointly hold it. The method is to take the company's one-day operating income, deduct all expenses, and contribute it to the country. On the employee side, they are encouraged to contribute all of their one-day salary income. It was decided and approved. It is reported that Mingyuan Company has implemented it on the 13th of this month. In addition to deducting expenses from the operating income of 200 yuan in national currency, all employees voluntarily contributed their one-day salary income of 165 yuan, 2 dimes, and 3 cents in national currency to the country. The money will be sent to the Wuhu County Chamber of Commerce to be forwarded to the National Government National Defense Committee.</p>

<p>The Hangping section of the Shuogan et al. seawall is showing a dangerous situation as the seawall is shifting outwards. The Construction Department has specially dispatched Zhou Zhenlun, director of the Water Conservancy Engineering Office, to conduct an on-site inspection. He returned to Hangzhou on the evening of the 19th. According to reports, a hundred meters of the Shuogan seawall is not only shifting outwards, but also because the silt outside the seawall has recently been eroded by huge tides, the bottom of the seawall is hollow, and the seawall is leaning outwards, teetering on the verge of collapse. If repairs are not carried out quickly, once the tide rises, the seawall will inevitably be washed away, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway along the seawall is also in danger of being cut off. It is now planned to apply to the provincial government for an allocation of 100,000 yuan for major repairs and reconstruction of the stone seawall to protect it.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Sino-American Association and American Chamber of Commerce Held a Grand Banquet Last Night, Chairmen Franking and Guo Bingwen Gave Speeches, Performed Wireless Radio Communication with the Plane, and Wang Xiaolai and Three Others Gave Speeches in the Plane <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-American Trade Association and the American Chamber of Commerce, in order to expand Sino-American trade and enhance Sino-American relations, held a grand joint banquet last night at the American Club. Franking, representative of the Sino-American Trade Association and President of the American Chamber of Commerce, gave a speech. Wang Xiaolai, Arnold, Danegee, Xu Maigan, and others performed wireless radio communication from an airplane. The sound was clear and audible throughout the venue. At 10 o'clock, there were magic shows and trade films, and the event ended joyfully at 12 o'clock late at night. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Venue Decoration</p>
<p>The entire fifth floor of the American Club at 209 Fuzhou Road was decorated with red silk banners with the words "Sino-American Co-prosperity," "International Harmony," and "Exchange of Goods." The doors and windows were decorated with colorful silk fabrics, creating a magnificent atmosphere.</p>
<p>Attending Chairmen</p>
<p>The grand banquet yesterday was attended by Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce; Peng Xuepei, Director of the Ministry of Communications; Wen Yuqing, Director of the Aviation Department; Cai Jingjun, Director of the Public Security Bureau; Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau; Xu Peihuang, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau; Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce; Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Local Association; Danegee, General Manager of China Aviation Corporation; Zheng Lai, Director of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance; Yu Qiaqing, General Manager of Sanbei Company; Gosh, American Consul General; Stantung, Administrative Consul; Hillmeck, Inspector; Arnold, Commercial Counselor; Pallas, Commander of the U.S. Marine Corps; Tan Dewei, Manager of China Electric Company; Franking, President of the American Chamber of Commerce; Directors Feichemai, Hubujin, Kelilai, Graufuo, Feiste, Tugu De, Folimen, Pan Jin, Yadan Shi, Oermen, Jierlan, Makai; Guo Bingwen, Jin Runxiang, Bei Songsun, Directors of the Sino-American Trade Association; Miao Zhongxiu, General Manager; and Wu Yunzhai, Shou Jingwei, Xu Xinliu, and others, totaling more than 300 people.</p>
<p>Aviation Communication</p>
<p>The Sino-American guests were seated at 8:15 PM. Around 9 PM, Franking, President of the American Chamber of Commerce, stood up and requested Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce; Arnold, Commercial Counselor of the United States; Danegee, General Manager of China Aviation Corporation; and Xu Maigan, Manager of Chase Bank, to leave their seats and go by car to Longhua Airport, board a China Aviation Corporation airplane, and fly around the city. At 9:30 PM, Tan Dewei, Manager of China Electric Company, shouted to Franking, and then Arnold in the plane communicated with Franking at the venue. Then Wang Xiaolai in the plane communicated with Tan Dewei at the venue (Wang's speech is below). Finally, Danegee and Xu Maigan in the plane talked with Wen Yuqing and others at the venue. The sound was clear and audible throughout the venue.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai's Speech</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, said in his speech: "Today is the 151st anniversary of Sino-American trade and commerce. I am very honored to speak here. China and the United States are two great republics, located in the eastern and western hemispheres. In these 151 years, we have established a very friendly relationship. We know that 'friendship' is the foundation of everything, especially in the fundamental meaning of trade. Of course, there is a need, but if there are many people supplying the need, then the buyers and sellers will definitely choose to trade with those with whom they have always had a good friendship. There is a Chinese saying, 'Good comes and good goes,' which means that if someone comes with good intentions, they will definitely leave with good intentions. But the so-called good intentions are not just words, they must plant a seed of good intentions in everyone's heart. In the past, there was a debate between Gongsun Longzi and Kong Chuan. Gongsun Longzi said that chickens have three legs, and Kong Chuan said that chickens have only two legs. The result of the debate was that Gongsun Longzi won. For example, all tools, even if they have legs, cannot walk, which is enough to prove it. But Kong Chuan said, 'Gongsun Longzi can win people's mouths, but not their hearts.' Winning people's mouths, though winning, is useless. Winning people's hearts allows the good intentions in their hearts to direct their hands to take the money earned from sweat and blood to buy goods. In the past, China and the United States did indeed plant such good intentions in each other's hearts. I hope that these good intentions will grow longer and prosper, and that we can cultivate these good intentions throughout the world, and that China and the United States can build this foundation."</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>After Wang Xiaolai and the other three left their seats, Franking, President of the American Chamber of Commerce, stood up and gave a speech, welcoming and introducing the distinguished guests. He decided to have Guo Bingwen, Chairman of the International Trade Bureau, represent the Sino-American Trade Association and give a speech in English. He said, in brief, "The purpose of tonight's meeting is to enhance Sino-American friendship and develop Sino-American trade. Representatives of the two countries are gathered here, which is a great event. We cannot help but think of the 150-year history of Sino-American relations, and what runs through it is sincerity and friendship. This pleasant history is the result of mutual understanding and trust. In general, for countries to have smooth trade relations, they must be based on mutual harmony. How to further promote the development of Sino-American friendship and promote political, cultural, and economic relations is a common obligation of the people of both countries. In this era, economic nationalism is prevalent, and countries are vying to set up various trade barriers. In fact, no independent country can do without mutual assistance. This is especially true for China and the United States, because China is an important consumer of American goods, and the United States is also a major customer of China. (Recently, the United States has ranked first in China's foreign trade.) The American economic recovery movement is underway, and China's national economic construction movement is also just beginning. In the future, the increase in the purchasing power of the two countries and the expansion of the volume of trade are expected. However, we must remember that although emotion and purchasing power are important factors in international trade, the success of trade cannot rely solely on emotional factors, nor can it only depend on the purchasing power of its people. International trade is often the goal of international competition. If China wants to maintain the American market, it must strive to improve its products. Conversely, if the United States wants to expand trade with China, its traders must be able to provide more favorable terms to Chinese merchants. If these conditions can be fully realized, the future of Sino-American trade will be even more brilliant."</p>
<p>Entertainment Performances</p>
<p>After the chairman's speech, Gosh, the American Consul General, and others also gave speeches. The speeches were long and omitted for brevity. At 10:10 PM, McLeana, a world-renowned magician, began to perform various novel magic tricks to add to the fun. At 10:50 PM, trade films were shown, and the event ended joyfully at 12:00 midnight.</p>

<p>According to the National News Agency, the 31st of last month was Chairman Chiang's 50th birthday. In addition to holding a city-wide party member dinner to celebrate, the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters also sent a telegram to Chiang to congratulate him. It is reported that the Municipal Party Headquarters has received Chiang's telegram of thanks.

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Liu Zhenhuan, former Commander-in-Chief of the Gui Army, recently went to Zhejiang with friends to visit famous scenic spots such as Tianmu and Mogan. He returned to Shanghai from his tour yesterday. According to him, the German-Japanese alliance has been rumored for a long time, and has recently become more and more solid. Germany and Japan are the two major countries in the East and West that are breaking the status quo. Their need for colonies and outward development is the same, and Communist Russia is indeed the same target of opposition for both countries. Moreover, Japan's hatred of Soviet Russia is no less than that of Germany, so under the same interests.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Ceremony for the Start of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, Shanghai Banking Group to Send Representatives to Participate, Chen Guangfu and Others Reply That They Cannot Attend <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway in Sichuan Province is about to begin. Liu Xiang, Director of the Sichuan-Kangxi Pacification Office, and Lu Zuofu, Director of the Sichuan Construction Department, have specially telegraphed Zhang Gongquan, Minister of Railways, and Wu Dingchang, Minister of Industry, to preside over the ceremony. At the same time, they telegraphed Chen Guangfu, Zhou Zuomin, Xu Xinliu, and other leaders of the financial community in this city to participate in the grand ceremony. It is learned that Chen and others are unable to attend due to busy affairs and have replied by telegram. However, it is heard that the banking group will send representatives to attend. To have today's combination, but at the current stage, it is still stuck in a roundabout manner. The launch of the war against Russia still needs to wait for the development of the future situation. Currently, Germany is only doing preparatory work. The recent tense situation in North China is also this kind of symbolic movement. As for the background of the Suiyuan military, I will not go into detail. However, in recent years, with the efforts of the whole country, the completion of unification, and the determination, we are very confident in the battle in Suidong. The enthusiasm of the various circles in the aid of Sui movement is enough to show the sincerity of the national people in loving the country, and it can also be seen that the future of the Chinese nation is very hopeful. Currently, in terms of warfare, we have repeatedly won victories, and the annihilation of the ugly class can be expected soon. As for someone wanting to use Soviet Russia, which opposes communism, to swallow our country's territory, and to seize our country's territory as a base for war against Russia, the intention is very obvious and does not need to be inferred. In my opinion, if Japan is sincere in adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, if it does not correct this point, the peace of East Asia is very worrying. I hope that the Japanese authorities will realize this as soon as possible, so that the feelings of the people of the two countries will increase misunderstanding, and the future of the Taihe nation will be unfavorable. Liu Zhenhuan, former Commander-in-Chief of the Gui Army, telegraphed Fu Zuoyi, Chairman of Sui Province, yesterday, saying, "To Chairman Fu Zuoyi of Suiyuan, I miss you very much since we said goodbye in the old capital. In recent days, the bandits have invaded the border, and you have hit them head-on and repeatedly defeated the enemy's attack. The good news is frequently spread, and I admire you very much. I hope you will continue to work hard to stabilize the border, fight for survival for the nation, and add glory to the country. All Chinese people should save food and transport it to you, and wait for you with swords and guns to support you. The cold wind is strong, and the snow is full of bows and knives. We look forward to the west, and our expectations are extremely high. I send this telegram to express my condolences and look forward to good news. Your brother Liu Zhenhuan."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government instructed the Public Works Bureau, Land Bureau, and Public Security Bureau, stating that the General Customs Office of the Customs has approved the letter No. 1870 of November 11, 25th year of the Republic, stating that regarding the Jianghai Customs' plan to build a new explosives depot in Laosha, it has been repeatedly supported by your government to assist the Public Works Bureau, Land Bureau, and Public Security Bureau, which is very grateful. However, the original plan has not been implemented due to various difficulties. The Ministry believes that this equipment is urgently needed, and has now come up with another plan to build special ships as floating explosives depots and moor them outside Wusongkou to replace the land-based explosives depot. It has also been approved by the Ministry of Finance. The plan to build an explosives depot in Laosha should be cancelled. Accordingly, I am writing to request that you check and inform the bureaus and announce it to the residents of the area. Approved, and ordered to inform all bureaus and announce to residents.</p>

<p>After the Ministry of Finance approved the extension of the implementation of the deposit interest income tax to New Year's Day next year, the Banking Association and the Money Industry Association each formed an income tax research committee to conduct research separately. The two associations believe that the banking and money industries are engaged in the same business, and deposit is completely the same. It is necessary to conduct joint research. It was decided to hold a joint meeting at 4:00 PM today at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club.

They will submit the opinions on income tax from banks of banking associations in various places, member banks, and money shops of money industry associations in various places for research.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Representative of Dutch Sugar, Stoker, Expresses That There is Absolutely No Request to Reduce Sugar Tax, Met with Liang Hejun of the Sugar Management Committee and Stated in Person, Sugar Industry Association Held a Meeting Yesterday to Report to Avoid Misunderstandings <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, Mr. Stoker, representative of the Dutch Java Sugar Sales Office, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago to investigate the sugar sales situation in China. A few days ago, he met with Chairman Liang of the Sugar Transportation and Sales Management Committee of the Ministry of Finance, and the association officially stated on behalf of the Dutch sugar industry that the previous Western newspaper reported that Dutch sugar merchants and a certain country's sugar industry had signed an agreement to change the Chinese sugar industry market and jointly requested the Chinese government to reduce the import tax on foreign sugar. It is completely false and there is no such thing. Fearing that it would cause misunderstandings among Chinese sugar merchants, he asked Liang to convey this to the sugar merchants. Therefore, at 4:00 PM yesterday, Chairman Liang specifically convened the directors of the China National Sugar Production and Sales Association at the meeting to convey this situation and asked them to inform sugar merchants across the country to avoid misunderstandings. It can be proved that the Western newspaper's report is untrue, and the sugar tax will not change, which is even more firm. Sugar merchants across the country can also operate with peace of mind.</p>

The Federation is also promoting the "One-Dollar Aid Suiyuan Movement" and has sent a special telegram to all agencies, groups, and schools across the country to promote it. The original telegram stated, "The bandits and puppets are invading the border, and the situation is serious. Fortunately, Chairman Suiyuan Chuan and all the soldiers are fighting bravely, but they have not yet succeeded. However, the bandits and puppets are acting recklessly, and their background is obvious. To kill the enemy and achieve results, we must rely on substantial support. Since September 18th, our territory has been shrinking day by day, and Suiyuan has become the only barrier for the country. In terms of the situation, Suiyuan is the gateway to North China. If there is any mistake, the enemy will drive straight in, and the whole country will be in danger. Therefore, the bandit and puppet invasion of Suiyuan is by no means a local war, but a continued step in the enemy's plan to destroy China. We must concentrate the strength of the whole country and rise up to rescue it. Everyone should recognize that saving Suiyuan is saving the country, and saving the people of Suiyuan is saving ourselves. The situation is urgent, and we must not wait and see any longer. Moreover, in this cold winter season, the north is a frozen and snowy land, the disaster victims are starving, and the soldiers are suffering from the cold, urgently awaiting rescue. Therefore, this Federation has launched the 'One-Dollar Aid Suiyuan Movement,' hoping that all compatriots across the country will make a great wish to save the country and enthusiastically donate, and use the collected funds to comfort the soldiers on the front lines and the disaster victims. However, the movement to save the country is not limited to one place, so this telegram is sent to convey the main points of the 'One-Dollar Aid Suiyuan Movement,' respectfully requesting you to lead your subordinates, awaken the people, and promote it uniformly to encourage morale and save the country from danger." Furthermore, the Federation, in view of the increasingly serious Sui border war, and at the same time, a certain party transported a large number of poison gas bombs and poison gas launchers from Dolun, preparing to release poison gas against us, deeply feels that purchasing gas masks and transporting them to the front lines is more urgent than providing winter clothing such as gloves. After a proposal by Federation member Li BieKui, it was decided to launch a mass campaign to collect gas masks so that the patriotic soldiers on the front lines can be fearless.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Good Phenomenon in International Trade, Trade Surplus with the United States <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The main countries in my country's international trade are the United States, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Since the implementation of the legal tender policy, the import and export trade between these four countries and China has been on the rise. According to the customs trade statistics report, my country's trade with the United States has turned into a good phenomenon of surplus over export. According to last year's January to September, the trade deficit between China and the United States was 25,877,000 customs gold units, totaling 45,163,000 yuan in national currency. From January to September this year, this trade deficit has turned into a surplus, with the amount reaching 1,876,000 customs gold units, totaling 4,425,000 yuan in national currency. Other than the increase of 5,057,000 customs gold units in my country's trade deficit with Germany, my country's trade deficit with Japan has decreased by 15,637,000 customs gold units, and the trade deficit with the United Kingdom has also decreased by 5,303,000 customs gold units. Looking at the above figures, the total amount of my country's foreign trade has a trend of reducing the trade deficit. The trade with the United States, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom, the main countries, not only reduced the trade deficit but also had a trade surplus. With the exchange rate and prices reaching stability, if the government and the people can work together to improve the quality of national goods and open up overseas markets, it is expected that in the near future, we will be able to achieve trade balance and turn the trade deficit into a surplus.</p>

<p>Labor Unrest in Cotton Mills</p>
<h3 id="e103">A Large Number of Male and Female Workers Sentenced to Detention Separately… A Total of Sixty-Five People… Gathering in an Open Space in Caoxiebang, Macau Road, Apparently Planning Some Action, Detained for Investigation <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Recently, labor unrest has been frequently occurring in Japanese-owned cotton mills. The Putuo Road Police Station, due to the concentration of cotton mills within its jurisdiction, has been taking strict preventive measures and ordering detectives to gather intelligence. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Detective No. 268 of the Police Station observed over a hundred male and female workers gathered in an open space in Caoxiebang, Macau Road, apparently planning some action. He immediately reported to the Police Station, which dispatched a large number of detectives to arrest them. Ma Guozhen, Wang Xiaosanzi, Liang Qingyou, Liu Jinle (all male), Zhang Adi, Lu Meimei, Zhao Jindi, Wang Jinmei, Zheng Caiyun, Wang Yueying, Zhao Meidi, Zhang Xiumei, Xu Linmei, Wang Caizhen, Han Jvdi, Gan Yingdi, Wang Xiuying, Li Amei, Wu Zhangdi, Wu Hanzhen, Zhu Gendi, Wang Guizhen, Zheng Xiuzhuo, Wang Advan, Gao Yufeng, Xu Xiaomei, Wu Shouzhen, Wang Yuzhen, Gao Miaoying, Chen Xiuying, Wang Xiaomei, Lu Xiaomei, Chen Xiaomei, Chen Guiying, and Xu Longying, thirty-five workers from the Japanese-owned Nei Wai Cotton Mill No. 7, who were on strike, were arrested. In addition, in nearby No. 51, Jiang Yueying, Song Caixia, Zhao Jvfeng, Zhang Dezhen, Wang Yingmei, Wang Amei, and Han Xiaomei, seven people, were arrested. At the time of the arrest, Jiang and others were beating Ni Caifeng, a female foreman at Nei Wai Cotton Mill No. 7, because Ni did not participate in their strike group. They were all taken back to the Police Station. At 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The Police Station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, explained the case and, in accordance with Article 304 of the Criminal Law, requested severe punishment. After questioning by Judge Pan Xingyang, Jiang Yueying and Song Caixia were sentenced to twenty days of detention each, Zhao Jvfeng, Zhang Dezhen, Wang Yingmei, and Wang Amei were sentenced to ten days of detention each, Han Xiaomei was declared innocent because she was under fourteen years of age, and the rest were sentenced to five days of detention each as a warning.</p>
<p>Furthermore, at the Japanese-owned Shanghai Second and Third Cotton Mills, No. 1970 Yangshupu Road, after a labor strike occurred on the 8th of this month, it was quickly resolved. However, at 6:00 AM the day before yesterday, the labor unrest reignited. At the time, a large number of female workers prevented others from going to work and threw spindles, causing the situation to relapse into a strike. When the obstruction of work occurred, the factory immediately telegraphed the Police Station, which ordered a large team of detectives to suppress the unrest. Tao Xiaomei, Wang Jinfeng, Zhou Ada, Yang Xiangxiuzi, Zhou Lingzhen, Wang Xiuying, Yu Genying, Yu Gendi, Cao Linmei, Shi Linmei, Zhou Agen, Chen Xiaolai, Gao Gendi, Dai Qiaozi, Yang Gendi, Wang Zhaodi, Xu Xiuying, Wang Xiuying, Dong Xiaobao, Xu Biying, Wang Jinmei, Chen Xiuzhen, and Chen Guibao, twenty-three female workers, were escorted to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. The Police Station's lawyer, Jiang Baolian, filed charges under Article 305 of the Criminal Law for obstructing freedom. After questioning by Judge Zhan Liangce, Tao Xiaomei and others were sentenced to five days of detention each as a warning for jointly using coercion to obstruct others from exercising their rights.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Case of Japanese Sailor Nakayama Hideo; Yang Wendao Sick; Appeal Not Heard Yesterday; Notice of Postponement Given <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Guangdong native Yang Wendao and Ye Haisheng were arrested by the police and brought before the First Special District Local Court in connection with the gun slaying of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo last winter. After several months of investigation, both were sentenced to death. Yang and Ye both claimed to be dissatisfied and appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. A hearing was scheduled for the 20th of this month. It is now learned that Yang Wendao has been ill since being detained in the Xilao Prison in Tilanqiao. His condition is quite serious, and he has been transferred to the Public Works Department Hospital for treatment. As the scheduled hearing date arrived yesterday morning, the Second Branch of the High Court had been notified in advance of Yang's illness. At 5 p.m. on the 19th, because his condition had not improved and he could not be brought to court for interrogation, it was decided to postpone the hearing. The presiding judge of the criminal court, Yu Hua, notified the lawyers representing the two appellants, Yang and Ye, and the police lawyer of the reason for the postponement. Therefore, the hearing did not take place yesterday morning, and the future hearing date will have to wait until Yang recovers. It is currently difficult to predict.</p>

<p>The third horticultural exhibition organized by the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau officially opened yesterday at the Pudong Donggou Agricultural and Forestry Farm (formerly known as the Garden Farm). Visitors were in high spirits. The exhibition area was decorated from the Donggou ferry terminal, along the way full of national flags. There was a horizontal banner that read "Shanghai Third National Arts Exhibition." Next to the entrance hung a couplet: "Beauty and wealth gathered in the garden, widely collecting all kinds of flowers in the same record, solemnly displaying art and planting, happily looking back to the beginning." The passage inside the gate was wide and spacious, planted on both sides with juniper trees, interspersed with various flowers. Among the greenery, red and purple competed in splendor, creating a refreshing atmosphere. In the western part, there was a shaded pergola, displaying various precious potted plants such as camellias, roses, and azaleas. In the center was a kidney-shaped pond, with a fountain above and fish swimming below, creating a unique and interesting scene. Turning west was a humble room, displaying exotic cacti, succulents, and begonias. Outside the greenhouse along the riverbank was a second gate, with a couplet hanging beside it, reading "Bamboo rhymes with maple red, vegetables and fruits compete for beauty, mountains surround water, pine and cypress flourish." Inside the gate, earthen hills stretched, flowers and trees thrived. Being in it, one felt like in a paradise. In the center of the exhibition area, there was a specially built thatched hall, named "Material Splendor," with a couplet beside it, reading, "Objects contend for novelty, scarlet, yellow, red, and purple, flowers and fruits flourish together, trees are planted and forests are vast." In the center of the hall, there was a plaque inscribed by Mayor Wu, reading "Exhaust the Land's Strength." Below, there was a terraced chrysanthemum slope, arranging precious chrysanthemums, with no less than several hundred varieties. There were also a hundred antique vases, filled with various chrysanthemums and wildflowers. Around the area were distributed the products of various companies, such as fruit trees, vegetables, local fruits, horticulture, and manufacturing tools, which were extremely exquisite. The fragrance of flowers lingered, and the fallen petals were colorful, making a spectacular sight. The prizes from various sectors that had been delivered included a pure silver "Award" shield donated by Mr. Du Yong, a silver shield donated by Director Lin of the Shanghai Municipal Audit Office, inscribed with "The Light of Agriculture," a brocade screen donated by Director Xu of the Finance Bureau, titled "The Joy of the Garden," a silver shield donated by Commander Ji of the Municipal Security Regiment, inscribed with "Proficient in Art and Planting," a shield donated by Mr. Zhao Shuyong of the Shen Bao, inscribed with "Old Farmer's Cold Fragrance," a package of books from the Zhonghua Book Company, a silver shield donated by Mr. Xi Guansheng, inscribed with "The Light of Horticulture," and a pair of silver shields donated by Mr. Zhu Dazhai, inscribed with "A Beautiful Woman Beyond the World, Silent Immortal."

<p>Ke Lai Company, located at No. 410 Sichuan Road, specializes in shoe polish and other businesses. It has a factory at Nos. 307 and 308 East Jiaxing Road, and employs Zhang Rufa from Ningbo as the factory engineer. At about 11 a.m. yesterday, the factory owner, believing that a newly invented oil could also be made into shoe polish, but that the temperature required for distillation had to be higher than usual, instructed engineer Zhang Rufa to try it. He was instructed to increase the temperature of the refining pot to 120 degrees. Zhang obeyed the order. Unexpectedly, the pot exploded when it was subjected to excessive heat, causing the head of engineer Zhang Rufa and the face of female worker Zhang Wang to be scalded by boiling water. Zhang was more seriously injured. After the incident, the factory owner telegraphed the police, who dispatched a car to send them to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Kuang Hongsheng, a 33-year-old Ningbo native, lived at No. 1182 Robert Road, Gordon Road, and ran the Hongfeng Tobacco and Exchange Shop. At around 11 p.m. last night, while Kuang was settling accounts in the shop, a man suddenly knocked on the door and burst into the shop. Without asking questions, he pulled out a pistol and fired a shot at Kuang. The bullet entered Kuang's left back, passed through his left chest, and exited, causing him to fall to the ground immediately, bleeding profusely. The assailant abandoned the gun and attempted to flee. Fortunately, Police Constable No. 1921 from the Putuo Road Police Station was on duty nearby, heard the gunshot, and rushed to investigate. Seeing a man rushing out in a panic, he knew something was wrong and arrested him. Kuang's family members also came out in pursuit, and after questioning them, the police learned the circumstances. They rushed the injured man to the hospital for treatment, while the assailant was taken to the police station for questioning. The assailant confessed that his name was Li Agen and that he and Kuang Hongsheng had worked on the same ship. He was fired due to Kuang's accusations, so he hated Kuang deeply. Today he came to take revenge and firmly denied robbery and murder. After obtaining the confession, the police detained the assailant, as the case still required investigation, and will send him to the court for trial this morning.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Two Married Men, Forcing Prostitution? Ji Wang Accused of Obscenity; Two Witnesses Fail to Appear for Interrogation <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The afternoon before yesterday, a woman from Huzhou named Feng Baozhen (22 years old) reported to the Lao Zha Police Station that she had come to Shanghai on the fourth day of the eighth month of this year, as a guest at the home of her relative, Ji Wang, a woman from Huzhou, at No. 124, Tai Ren Lane, No. 49 North Zhejiang Road. Unexpectedly, the woman forced her to engage in a prostitute's life, accompanying her to the Dahua Hotel at No. 250 Beijing Road every night to receive guests. She was already married to a man named Feng Fachun, who is now at home in Xinshi Town, in her hometown. Because she could not bear the hardship, she requested assistance. Western Detective Crawford, Chinese Detective Yang Dechun, and Chinese Sando Head No. 1013, took Feng and rushed to No. 124 Tai Ren Lane and arrested Ji Wang. At the same time, they found another woman from Huzhou, Zhu Ying (22 years old), in the house. They learned that Zhu was also married, and her husband, A Jin, lived in Baibiao Village, Huzhou. She had come to Shanghai on the sixteenth day of the lunar calendar of this year and was induced by Ji Wang to become a prostitute. She had to hand over all the money she earned to Ji Wang. The detectives detained Ji Wang. Yesterday morning, they sent her to the Criminal Court 1 of the Special First Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the facts and prosecuted her for violating Article 231 of the Criminal Law. He said that Feng Baozhen and Zhu Ying wished to return to their hometowns and should be contacted so that their families would be notified. Ji Wang initially denied the charges, but after the police found tea waiter Luo Aweng of the Dahua Hotel and tenant Xu Chunxian of Tai Ren Lane to testify, she admitted to the charges. Today, although Luo and Xu were summoned, they did not appear in court. Next, the two women, Feng and Zhu, submitted a report of their experiences. When questioned, Ji Wang claimed that the two women voluntarily became prostitutes and were not forced, and that she did not receive any money from them. Judge Qian Hongye reviewed the confession and ordered that the hearing be postponed for a week.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Lu Zhiqing's Career is Boring; Forging Keys to Steal Customs Declaration Boxes; Privately Engraving Seals to Steal and Sell Goods; The Case Solved Because of an Overloaded Rickshaw <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Lu Zhiqing, a Ningbo native who previously worked as a clerk at the Minli Customs Brokerage, had a fanciful idea after losing his job. He manufactured counterfeit keys to the customs declaration boxes of the customs declaration offices and stole bills of lading to defraud goods. The case was discovered by Cheng Yongnian, a detective at the customs water patrol police station. The details have been reported earlier. The day before yesterday, he was interrogated by Detective He. Lu Zhiqing confessed that he was 22 years old, from Ningbo, and lived at No. 169 Hong'an Lane, Haining Road. Last year, he worked as a runner at the Minli Customs Brokerage. The company closed down at the end of last year due to sluggish business, and he was unemployed at home. On the fourth or fifth day of the national calendar of March, he went to the customs waiting room and used a brass key that he had found there in July of last year to try to open the customs declaration boxes. He had been an apprentice at the Yuxiang Public Association, so he knew that the key was for the customs declaration boxes and understood the procedures for customs declaration. He opened the No. 698 customs declaration box, stole a bill of lading for hat blanks, and forged the seal of the Gongxing Customs Brokerage, which was registered in that box. He printed it on the bill of lading and went to the Taikoo No. 10 warehouse. He hired a rickshaw, took out a box of hat blanks, and transported it to his home. He opened the box and found 30 dozen hat blanks. In mid-March, he sold them to the Hong Kong Cork Hat Company in Yangshupu through a buyer of old goods for 60 yuan, giving 6 yuan to the buyer of old goods and 40 cents to the rickshaw puller. From May to July, he studied acting at the Guiyou Drama Club in the Fu'an Amusement Park. Later, because there was no progress, he stopped and stayed at home to imitate the keys to the customs declaration boxes. Every day from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m., he tried to open the boxes in the customs waiting room. He made a mark on the keys and copied the box numbers and tried to find out the names of the customs brokerages registered in each box. Over two months, he made five keys that could be used, plus the two he found, for a total of seven. In mid-September, he went to the waiting room and stole a bill of lading for grapes from the Tongtai Customs Brokerage in the No. 682 customs declaration box. He withdrew 10 boxes of grapes from the Shuntai Yihua Wharf Warehouse, totaling 480 cans. Because there was no trademark paper on the outside, he could not sell them. He only gave the grapes in the cans to others and sold the iron cans to old goods stores. So far, he has sold more than 280 cans. On October 13, he stole a Finance Ministry cigarette transport license from the Meisheng Customs Brokerage in the No. 551 customs declaration box, and took it home. He saw that it was useless, so he left it at home. On the 11th of this month, he stole a bill of lading for lotus seeds from the Jingji customs declaration box (No. 741). He entrusted the Anli Transportation Company to withdraw 10 boxes of lotus seeds, but only five boxes arrived. When the car arrived near his home in Hele Lane, Haining Road, he sent them to his friend Hui Yongfeng's place (Huiheji shaft head workshop in the Chenghuang Temple Academy Road). He opened the boxes and packed the lotus seeds into four burlap bags and hid the rest in an empty coffin in Hui's house. Two days later, he and his friends Sun Zishan and Wang Yukang negotiated the sale of 1 dan (a unit of weight) and received 30 yuan in national currency. He paid off debts and redeemed things from the pawnshop and now has only 10 yuan left. The remaining passes were stolen by him in the customs waiting room during the last two months and have not been used. He engraved four fake seals, including Gongxing, Tongtai, Jingji and Wan Yu Tai. The seals of Gongxing and Tongtai had been destroyed by him. According to his confession, the accomplices Hui Yongfeng and Wang Libai were arrested. They confessed to the crimes. Witness Wang Kezheng testified that Lu Zhiqing went to his Anli Transportation Company to load 10 boxes of lotus seeds, so he sent a rickshaw to carry them. It was purely business and he knew nothing else. Rickshaw puller Shi Jiayao confessed that he loaded five boxes of lotus seeds. Because the rickshaw was considered overloaded on the road by the police, he hired a car to transport them separately, because the sea-ning road Hele lane would not accept the shipment. Because the time was too late, he had to send them to the Hongkou police station, thus cracking the case. After a thorough investigation, the police summoned four victims: Shen Liansheng of Jingji, Xu Yongkang of Tongtai, Dai Shaozhen of Gongxing, and Wu Baoheng of Meisheng. They also confiscated the counterfeit keys, a notebook, 33 passes, 10 yuan in national currency from the sale of stolen goods, three seals, three bills of lading, one cigarette transport permit, seven keys (three copper and four lead), and nine customs declaration box number lists. The defendant was sent to the local court for trial yesterday.</p>

<p>The city's machine donation for birthday celebrations has raised 1 million yuan, with more than 200,000 yuan of pledges yet to be paid. Therefore, all sectors of the city launched a one-day sports event to increase the results. Since the promotion, there has been a surge of implementation, and the results have been quite good. In addition to sending personnel to personally contact the various groups of the Machine Purchase Birthday Celebration Association that have not yet been held, letters were sent yesterday requesting support for an early start. Yesterday, the association received a donation of one day's salary from all the staff of the Shenxin First Workers' Children's School, including Wang Zidong, Lu Yunzhou, Sun Junwan, Yun Hangyun, Hua Qinbao, Zhou Sijing, Sun Ping, Huang Hongbin, Ye Ruiying, small stores, etc., totaling eight yuan. It also received 23 yuan from miscellaneous fundraising, 25 yuan from Zhang Yongliang Dibao, 5 yuan donated by Wang Mengrong, and 1 yuan each from Gu Genfu, Yang Cunquan, and Wu Xiaofu. The association sent letters of thanks separately.

It is reported that it will start soon. The exhibition hall and library are also trying their best to expand, and are collecting materials from various agencies and companies for display, so the public can visit.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Xihe Third Factory Striked the Night Before Last; Labor Disputes at Japanese Factories Stalemate; Du Yuesheng to Serve as Mediator <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Dagon News Agency reports that Du Yuesheng, chairman of the Shanghai Local Coordination Association, is to serve as a mediator in view of the fact that labor disputes at Japanese-owned yarn factories have been rising one after another, and the situation is trending towards expansion. This not only causes losses for both labor and management but also affects local security.</p>
<p>Situation in Factories in East Shanghai Eases</p>
<p>More than 3,500 workers at Shanghai Second and Third Yarn Factories, owned by Japanese merchants on Yangshupu Road Guangxin Wharf, went on a strike because the factory's promise to increase wages had not been formally announced and because the factory reported to the Grantham Road Police Station that 29 workers were inciting the strike and had been arrested. After many persuasion by the heads of various departments and classes, only 50% of the day shift (Class A) went to work yesterday morning, and 70% of the night shift (Class B) went to work. There are only six or seven hundred workers on strike. The other factories, such as Gongda Second, Tongxing, Dakang, Yufeng, First, Second, Donghua, and Shanghai First, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth, are all working as usual, and the situation is very calm, and it is not expected to cause serious disputes again.</p>
<p>Xihe Third Factory Responds to Strike</p>
<p>The Xihe First, Second, and Third Yarn Factories, owned by Japanese merchants on Robert Road in West Shanghai, employ more than 3,400 male and female workers. The factory usually treats workers more harshly than other yarn factories, with daily work hours reaching 14 hours without any breaks. However, the factory has implemented a 5% increase in wages in response to workers' demands, but the 10% increase demanded by the workers has not been met, so they expressed dissatisfaction. At around 7 p.m. the night before last (the 19th), the night shift workers at the Third Factory first went on strike and shut down the motors. The workers at the First and Second Factories followed suit, and all work was suspended. The head of the meal workers at the First Factory persuaded the workers to resume work, so at about 10 p.m., more than 100 workers living in the factory resumed work. At about 6 a.m. yesterday morning, only more than 170 workers living in the factory went to work, but they were released at about 10 a.m. At about 2 p.m., the factory management visited Tan Baoshou, the chief of the Caojiadu Branch Bureau, requesting him to persuade the workers to return to work, and all disputes should wait for resolution. Director Tan and Inspector Gu persuaded the workers, and in order to comply with Director Tan's wishes, about 1,200 night shift workers went to work at about 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Representatives of the Three Factories Petitioned Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>After the workers of the Xihe First, Second, and Third Factories went on strike, they sent 18 male and female representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau at 10:30 a.m. yesterday to petition. Wang Xianqing, director of the mediation section of the Third Department, received them. The representatives stated the factory's usual treatment of workers and the conditions for demanding wage increases and requested assistance from the bureau. Director Wang inquired about the process in detail and stated that the bureau would send personnel to investigate the workers' demands and then find a way to handle them. The representatives left at about 11 a.m.</p>
<p>Dispatching Personnel to Investigate and Request Instructions on Handling</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a reporter from Dagon News Agency interviewed Wang Xianqing, director of the mediation section of the Third Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, to inquire about how to handle the labor disputes at Japanese-owned yarn factories. Director Wang said that in order to understand the situation in the striking factories and the attitudes of labor and management, he would continue to send personnel to investigate the West Shanghai and East Shanghai districts. As for the handling of the labor disputes and whether to visit the authorities of the Japanese Textile Association in China again to discuss a solution, he still needs to ask the director for instructions before determining the policy. From the government's standpoint, he hopes that the labor disputes will be resolved as soon as possible to avoid losses for both parties.</p>
<p>Labor Dispute Inspections at Other Factories</p>
<p>(1) All 3,500 workers at the Toyota First and Second Factories, owned by Japanese merchants near the Zhongshan Road Bridge in Caojiadu, are still on strike. The Caojiadu Public Security Branch Bureau and the concession police have sent police to the factory and the surrounding roads to maintain strict security to prevent incidents. The Japanese have also sent armed marines to be stationed at the entrances of the two factories, and the situation is quite serious. (2) There are a total of 3,249 male and female workers at the Neiwaimian First and Second Factories on Robert Road. Since the workers in the Second Factory's cloth room took the lead in striking the day before yesterday, the day before yesterday, the workers in the First Factory had a conflict with the foremen, so all workers were released. Although the factory started work as usual yesterday morning, only more than 200 day shift workers went to work, and only 127 night shift workers went to work. (3) There are a total of more than 4,500 workers at the Neiwaimian Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Factories on West Suzhou Road. More than 1,000 day shift workers went to work yesterday morning, but the number of night shift workers was reduced. About 120 workers in the Fifth Factory worked, and about 140 workers in the Sixth and Seventh Factories worked. Most of them were workers in the micro-cloth room. (4) Yesterday, two-thirds of the day shift workers and one-third of the night shift workers at the Neiwaimian Eighth Factory on Gordon Road went to work. (5) Yesterday, more than 200 day shift workers and only 147 night shift workers at the Neiwaimian Ninth Factory on MacKinnon Road went to work. (6) The Ri Hua First Factory on Robert Road paid wages yesterday afternoon, but the wages had not been issued to the workers, so no labor disputes occurred. All workers went to work as usual. (7) The workers at Neiwaimian Third and Fourth Factories at No. 19 West Suzhou Road, the Gongda Third Factory at Jessfield Road Xingjiapo Road, and the Tongxing First Factory on Gordon Road have increased their wages by 10%, so they have not been affected. All workers are working as usual.</p>
<p>Representatives of the General Labor Union Visit the Mayor</p>
<p>In order to resolve the labor disputes at Japanese-owned yarn factories as soon as possible, the Shanghai General Labor Union, led by its chairman Zhu Xuefan, Standing Committee members Zhou Xuexiang and Ye Xianggao, visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government at 10 a.m. yesterday. Because the mayor was attending a meeting, Secretary Yu was sent to receive them. The representatives stated the various situations and hoped that the Municipal Government would find a way to mediate to avoid the expansion of the labor disputes.</p>
<p>Key to Labor Disputes No Longer Local</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from Dagon News Agency met a foreman working at a Japanese yarn factory and inquired about the labor situation. According to him, the treatment of workers in Japanese factories in China is too bad. For example, workers work for 12 hours a day, and there are no breaks during meals. While eating, they still have to take care of the work on the machine. If they are slightly careless, they will be punished. Now that the price of yarn is rising, the factories are making profits of tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands a year, but the workers believe that it is difficult to maintain their lives, and the demand for increased wages is not excessive. If the factory does not agree to increase wages by 10%, then the workers can only go on strike to make the factory aware of the situation. This kind of action is supported by the general public in society. Now that the labor disputes have broken out, the factory should quickly formulate concrete measures and increase wages across the board, then the labor disputes will naturally be resolved. Otherwise, local wage increases will still be difficult to stabilize the entire situation. In this serious labor dispute, the Japanese should quickly withdraw the marines stationed in the factory to avoid escalating the labor disputes. Otherwise, any misunderstandings could create other unfortunate events, and the situation will be even more difficult to handle.</p>
<p>Special Precautions in East and West Shanghai</p>
<p>Two days ago, the police authorities in the Chinese Concession received information from various sources that the Japanese-owned yarn factories that had not yet gone on strike would implement a general strike starting at 6 p.m. yesterday, so they prepared in advance. The West Shanghai district was given special attention. The Public Security Bureau police stations along Zhongshan Road Bailinan Road, Gower Road, Robert Road, and West Suzhou Road increased the number of armed police, densely deployed posts, and patrolled. More than 100 Japanese marines were stationed at the entrances of the Japanese-owned yarn factories. Red police cars patrolled the roads. Two armored vehicles and a No. 25 military truck were parked in front of the Toyota First and Second Factories. The police stations in various districts of East Shanghai also increased the number of riding patrols and special patrols, and the security was very tight.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Cautious, Discuss Countermeasures</p>
<p>Osaka, 20th, Allied News Agency Electric Dispatch: The Japanese Textile Trade Association in China held an emergency committee meeting at the Cotton Industry Hall on the morning of the 20th. Based on the information from various factories, they carefully discussed countermeasures. As a result, the local headquarters of the association will be responsible for handling the matter in the future. However, the Osaka branch believes that the issue is quite political, so they must avoid provocative attitudes such as closing down all factories at once and should deal with it carefully.</p>

<p>Li Guoshun, age 42, from Dongtai, residing at 187 Temple Back Road, Zhabei, was suddenly visited by two robbers at 7:45 PM last night. The robbers, wearing black cloth jackets and trousers, each wielding a box gun, entered Zhu's house, silencing them and beginning to loot. As the robbers entered, a vendor recognized them and ran to report to the police on duty, who relayed the message to the Linping Road Police Station. A patrol officer was dispatched to surround and arrest the robbers. The two robbers, realizing they were discovered, grabbed over 20 yuan worth of clothing and jewelry and attempted to escape. They encountered the police and opened fire to resist arrest. The police officer returned fire, and the robbers fought as they fled, firing a total of over twenty shots, the bullets raining down like a string of beads. Third-class officer Xu Zhishun, number 2711, was struck in the abdomen by a bullet that exited through his back, rupturing his large intestine and causing profuse bleeding. He collapsed to the ground. The two robbers seized the opportunity to escape into Temple East Road and quickly disappeared. A suspect was apprehended nearby and taken to the station for questioning. The wounded Officer Xu was transported to Tongren Hospital for treatment, where his condition was critical and his life was in danger.</p>

Hangzhou Mail Returned; Xi Zhoushi Hires Lawyer; Court Orders Defendant to Appear for Further Interrogation <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Nie Guizhi, a thirty-year-old woman from Yushan County, Jiangxi Province, has retained a lawyer to sue Xi Laichun, a man of seventy-two years, in the First Special District District Court for abandonment and other matters. She is also seeking alimony of 36,000 yuan. On the afternoon of the 11th of this month, Judge Huang convened a hearing, but the defendant did not appear. According to the plaintiff's lawyer, the defendant's residence includes 30 Jishan Lane, East-West Huade Road in this city, 21 Mashi Road in Hangzhou, and a villa in Qingdao. The court then ordered that the defendant be summoned for further interrogation. Previous reports mistakenly identified Xi Laichun as Xi Ehan, a wealthy merchant from Suzhou residing in Shanghai. However, the two Xis are distinct individuals and cannot be confused. This correction is made to prevent the spread of misinformation. Regarding the case, Judge Huang Risheng continued the hearing yesterday afternoon. However, the summons sent to 21 Mashi Road, Hangzhou, was returned by the post office as Xi Laichun was not there to receive it. Xi Laichun himself did not appear in court yesterday. However, Xi Zhoushi, from 30 Jishan Lane, East-West Huade Road, retained lawyer Jiang Yiping to represent her in court. Jiang stated that Xi Laichun originally lived in Hangzhou but had recently moved to Qingdao to recuperate due to illness. Lawyer Jiang also denied the facts alleged by Nie, stating that Jishan Lane has always been Xi Chun's residence and that the plaintiff's claim of cohabiting with Xi there is untrue. The court then questioned the plaintiff, who insisted that she was Xi Laichun's concubine, had been abandoned, and was in dire financial straits. She stated that if her livelihood were cut off, she would have no choice but to commit suicide by drowning. Judge Huang, noting the conflicting statements from both sides, determined that it was difficult to clarify the matter without the defendant's presence. He adjourned the hearing to the afternoon of the 27th of this month for further questioning.</p>

<p>Chen Shuxi, a 17-year-old from Yangzhou residing at 9 Renzhi Lane, Huade Road, went to Wanxing Pastry Shop at 949 East Huade Road on the afternoon of the 17th of this month to buy a cake for four copper coins. A dispute arose, and he was punched in the nose and bled by the shop owner, Lin Jinfu from Tongzhou, and Liu Cai from Guangdong. He returned home ill and was sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. After treatment, he recovered slightly and returned home. Unexpectedly, his condition worsened the day before, and his father sent him back to the hospital for treatment. He died at midnight. The body was sent to the Feilun Road morgue for examination. Liu and Lin were arrested by the Huishan Police and taken into custody. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Attorney Zhang Shizhu of the Public Works Department stated that according to the victim's side, Chen went to Wanxing to buy a cake and had a dispute over the selection, and was beaten in the nose and bled to death by the two defendants. According to the defendant Liu Cai, Chen took advantage of the situation to steal a hundred copper coins. Lin Jinfu noticed and they chased him out of the store. In a nearby alley, Lin grabbed the boy's hands while Liu slapped him on the ears, causing the nose injury. Chen Rushi, the boy's father, stated that he was away from home when he learned that his son had been beaten to death by the two defendants for buying a cake. He asked for justice and kowtowed to the court. Questioned, Liu Cai admitted that Chen stole a hundred copper coins and fled. The boss Lin Jinfu caught him and Liu slapped his ears. He did not strike anywhere else. Lin Yu Fu stated that Chen stole money buying the cake, and he caught him in the next alley. Liu Cai slapped his ears, but he did not strike elsewhere. He requested the court to investigate. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered them to be returned to custody and scheduled a further hearing. The body of Chen Shuxi was examined by Prosecutor Tang from the court, who determined that the deceased Chen Shuxi, male, died from injuries sustained in a beating. The body was handed over to his father, Chen Rusong, for burial.</p>

<p>Mr. Feng Bingnan of West Shanghai has obtained a winter melon. While its size may not be as large as a five-stone gourd, it is rare among melons. It was displayed at the recent Sino-Western Flower Show, where all who saw it marveled and it won an award. It weighs around 100 jin on the market scale. Yesterday, Lu Bohong, Gu Xinyi, Huang Hanzhi, and Zhu Jilin attempted to lift it, but they could not move it even an inch.

<p>Guohua Cotton Weaving Factory, located at 861 East Youheng Road, produces cotton毛衫褲 and other items. It has over one hundred workers. The factory closes for rest on the 5th and 20th of each month. Yesterday was a holiday. Unexpectedly, a fire broke out in the cutting room on the third floor of the factory. By the time the watchmen noticed, the raging flames were already spreading outwards. They rushed out to call for help. Workers living near the factory gathered and used the factory's own fire-fighting equipment to put out the fire, but without success. At this time, the fire brigade also received the news and drove fire engines to the scene. They quickly opened the windows and poured water around the area, and the fire gradually subsided, avoiding a major disaster. However, all the cotton pieces in the cutting room were burned to ashes. The yarn-shaking room and weaving room on the second floor, as well as the cargo room on the ground floor, were flooded and suffered water damage. Machine parts also sustained considerable losses. The total loss is estimated to be as high as eighty to ninety thousand yuan. It is said that the factory has fire insurance.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the fifth day of the art exhibition. From morning to evening, the number of visitors was extremely crowded. Due to the high quality of the works on display, including oil paintings, watercolors, landscapes, and portraits, all of which were excellent, Mr. Shu Xincheng, editor-in-chief of the China Bookstore, visited in the afternoon and highly praised the artist's paintings, saying that she was a talented and rare female painter in recent times and that her paintings should be published in a collection.

<h3 id="e124">Renji Hospital: Medical Report for Last Month <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Renji Hospital's report for October of this year states: outpatient visits: 14,617; new inpatients: 305; inpatient days: 6,340; average daily number of meals served: 450; male suicides: 34; female suicides: 31; emergency surgeries: 382; emergency surgeries due to factory accidents: 56; patients sent by the Public Concession Police: 321; patients sent by the French Concession Police: 71; deliveries: 18.</p>
<p>The above statistics indicate that the hospital's work in October followed seasonal trends. The number of outpatient visits decreased slightly compared to the summer months. Among the patients treated, dysentery and similar illnesses decreased. However, the number of patients treated for malaria remained high, including tertian malaria. The number of surgeries due to factory accidents increased. However, it is fortunate that the number of suicide attempts decreased by 20%. The hospital is optimistic and hopes that this decrease is a sign of the general improvement of Shanghai's economy. In October, Dr. Hu Zhujun terminated his work at the hospital, which was a regret for both parties. Dr. Hu was responsible for medical affairs, especially in the hospital's surgical department, and worked with unwavering enthusiasm. What he received in return was only a small amount of travel expenses. Recently, Dr. Hu also took on the work of the women's and children's surgical ward, declining any additional compensation. Dr. Hu's departure from Shanghai to Guangdong was due to family reasons. The loss of Dr. Hu here is a loss, but it is a blessing for Guangdong. In October, two long-term inpatients were discharged. One was Mr. Zhang Yanxi, who suffered from chronic fistula and had been hospitalized for nearly five years. After treatment, his condition showed little response. As a result, Mr. Zhang saw an unfortunate patient come to the hospital and felt that he should give up his bed for that person. The hospital hopes that Mr. Zhang's decision will bring him good results after he changes location. Mr. Zhang is not yet able to work formally. The other patient who left the hospital was a child named Chen Qiaosheng. His departure was due to death. This child Chen was admitted to the hospital four years ago when he was only eight years old. He suffered from chronic hip tuberculosis, which later spread to tuberculous meningoencephalitis, which was the cause of his death. There is a story of generosity in this child's life that the hospital is eager to share. The child's condition, as described by Miss Xue Jisi, was known to the Poor Sunday School. Although the school was also materially poor, it was able to collect 6 jiao per day for the hospital expenses. The members of the school personally sent the money to the hospital. The Liverpool Sunday School also sent comfortable supplies. This act of kindness brought joy to this friendless and orphaned child.</p>

<p>Soochow University 30th Anniversary Special Issue</p>
<p>Our university is holding its 30th anniversary celebration and has received congratulatory inscriptions and artwork from leading figures in the country and sages from abroad, which are too numerous to include in this special issue. In addition to printing a separate special publication, we would like to express our sincere gratitude here.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Inaugural Address <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Zhanen</p>
<p>Our university was founded six years before the founding of the Republic of China by the Northern and Southern Baptist Conventions of the United States. Through arduous pioneering efforts and painstaking management, it has reached its present state. The times have changed repeatedly, and reforms have been carried out one after another. The right to education has been managed by Chinese people for ten years. At the beginning of its establishment, the scale was simple and crude, with only dozens of students, a few teachers, and one school building. Economic facilities were extremely difficult to obtain. Today, on the banks of the Wusong River, we have purchased more than 400 acres of land, with buildings connected by clouds, and a magnificent scene. The number of students exceeds one thousand, and there are more than one hundred teachers. The graduates who serve the society have reached thousands. The affiliated middle school, primary school, downtown business school, Hudong Commune, and rural service center are also moving forward and developing year by year. All of this is due to the spiritual cooperation, hard work, and struggle of the teachers and students of Soochow University for the past 30 years. The assistance of all sectors is also appreciated!</p>
<p>Now, in order to celebrate the 30th anniversary of our university, the teachers and students of the entire school are publishing a commemorative album, the Tianlai Quarterly, and distributing commemorative special issues in various newspapers today, to show the people of the country, hoping to attract wisdom and effort. I think about the hardships of the past creation and the efforts that should be made in the future, day and night. There are several aspects that need to be developed urgently in the future of our university: (1) Develop various colleges, improve courses, hire more teachers, increase the purchase of instruments and books, and add departments as needed. (2) Expand the Graduate School, establish research institutes, sort out the existing research programs, and pay special attention to research in society, economy, international relations, and natural sciences. (3) Improve affiliated departments such as middle schools, primary schools, downtown business schools, Hudong Commune, and rural service centers. Within the scope of talent and economic possibilities, we will actively expand and enhance effectiveness. Furthermore, considering the complexity of the international situation, the changes in the social environment, the increasing foreign aggression, and the seriousness of national difficulties, how can we guide young people to fight against the enemy with the same hatred and revive the nation in order to achieve self-reliance? This is the major mission of our university in the future. It is hoped that alumni and students will uphold the spirit of universal love and sacrifice of our university, abide by the school motto of integrity, loyalty, diligence, and love; sleep on brushwood and taste gall, and be vigilant at all times, so that in this time of crisis and upheaval, we can shoulder the heavy burden, sacrifice the small self, and save the big self, in order to achieve the goal of our university of cultivating talents for the country. This is what I respectfully state in addition to celebrating the 30th anniversary of the school's founding, in the midst of joy and excitement. I hope that domestic sages will continue to guide! Earnestly promote! And add to the glory of Soochow University to the utmost.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Soochow University's 30th Anniversary Address <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Zhengkang</p>
<p>Our university was established after many years of planning. It was founded in 1906 and officially opened in 1909. During the initial stage, Dr. Walter Russell Pettigrew, the first president, said in his report: "Our school has only been open for nine months, and the most difficult thing is the selection of teachers. This year, there are one or two teachers who, although learned, need to be corrected in terms of classroom management and student guidance. Unfortunately, one has resigned during this short period. The current problem is how to improve the level and complete the mission of our school." These few words are enough to understand the past policy of our school. Over the past thirty years, personnel have changed, but the policy has not changed. Last year's president's report said: "Our school has a considerable history since its establishment. However, today's success can only be called the beginning. We should continue to improve in order to realize the ideal of the founders." Thirty years have passed, but the consistency has remained the same. Our school has achieved what it has today, and we must remember the effective methods of teaching in the past. If there is considerable progress to be said, it is based on the achievements of the founding period, the so-called deep roots and luxuriant leaves, is it true?</p>
<p>Looking at the material progress of our school, what is worthy of praise is not the increase in school buildings, but the steps to promote the construction of buildings year by year, and the firm realization of the entire plan. Thirty years ago, there was only one classroom building. After that, buildings were added year by year, without interruption, all based on needs, planned according to needs, and realized by planning. Where there is a will, there is a way. This is what the past presidents can be proud of. Moreover, before each building is built, all expenses are carefully calculated, and construction is not started rashly until the funds are available. Therefore, the construction cost over the years has reached more than 1.097 million yuan by the end of last year, and there has never been any padding or borrowing. This is because it comes from free donations or is drawn from the accumulated surplus over the years. Only with a comprehensive plan and progressing on time can we have today's results. Here, we must recall the painstaking efforts of the executives of the past 30 years. In the future, the scope will become wider and the needs will increase with the times, but we will still adhere to the established policy and only wish to make gradual progress, not rapid progress.</p>
<p>Private schools often feel economically difficult, and Soochow University is no exception. According to the school's financial report, the first year's operating expenses (excluding construction costs) were 9,262 yuan, and ten years later it was 68,782 yuan, a difference of seven times. By 1929, it had increased to 282,545 yuan, an increase of five times. By the time of last year's total budget, it reached more than 340,000 yuan. The difference before and after is solid and far, but if we compare the progress that should have been made in 30 years at once, our school is still lagging behind. However, economic difficulties are a fact, and budgeting according to income is the only way for our school to cope with it. Whenever a budget is prepared, it must be revised in many ways until the income and expenditure are balanced. Therefore, since its opening, our school has not had the slightest loss. This is not enough to be proud of, because there are many things that should be兴 but have not been兴, and the feeling of having more than enough heart but not enough power is particularly painful. However, considering the future of our school, it is not enough to guarantee the future.</p>
<p>The number of undergraduate students over the years has gradually increased from 7 to 631, and the results are quite impressive. However, the average increase in the number of students in the entire school has not exceeded 50 per year. Except for a sharp decrease of more than 90 people due to the Shanghai War in one or two years, the rest have not exceeded two or thirty people. The so-called progress is gradual, and the decline is slow. In the past ten years, the number of freshmen has not exceeded about 200. Over the past thirty years, the number of students has gradually increased in order, which is gratifying. What is especially gratifying is the restriction of the number of students, so as to avoid the suspicion of emphasizing quantity over quality. As for the number of graduates in each session, from two to one hundred and eleven. Compared with the number of admissions each year (from 1921 to 1935), the highest percentage is 52%, and the lowest is 32%. In other words, only half of the freshmen in the first year can complete the program in four years and graduate. Economy and academics are the two major reasons. The former is due to economic difficulties, and dropping out of school halfway, and the latter is due to poor grades and dropping out or transferring. It is not easy to achieve the goal in four years and be worthy of the school's expectations.</p>
<p>"At thirty, one stands firm." Our school has reached the prime of life. All kinds of development plans after this are expected. Looking at universities in China, each has its own strengths, and the country's need for specialized talents is just beginning. Our school has a responsibility, and there are nearly a thousand graduates serving all parts of the country. How good their results are, the community will judge. However, how to cultivate students in school and in the future, so that they can be useful talents in the world and have a sound character, is something that must be taken into account. To sum up the achievements of our school today, in one word, it is steady progress. Steady progress is not rapid progress, nor is it slow progress, but a steady and active step to deal with the environment and plan development. In school affairs, we keep pace with the times, without being demanding or wasteful. In economy, we advocate thrift and use it properly. In teaching, we pay attention to basic knowledge and seek truth from facts. The world has quite a few people who find this commendable, so we state the facts in order to prepare people in the community who want to know the key to the success of our school.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Soochow University in the Past Thirty Years <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Rongquan</p>
<p>On the banks of the Huangpu River, the flowers and trees are lush, and three or five red buildings stand together, Soochow University is located there. It has been thirty years since its founding. In these thirty years, the hardships of its management and the beauty of its history are worthy of mention. Now, on the occasion of the 30th anniversary, I will briefly tell you about it.</p>
<p>I. The First Ten Years: The Founding Period</p>
<p>1. Completion of the founding plan: Twelve years before the founding of the Republic of China (1900 AD), American Northern and Southern Baptist missionaries stationed in China gathered in Shanghai to avoid the Boxer Rebellion, and the idea of ​​establishing a university in Shanghai was first proposed. Two years later, the two churches held a joint meeting in Hangzhou and Shanghai, and the decision to establish the school was made. Three years later, the Board of Directors was formally established. The following year (six years before the founding of the Republic of China, namely 1906 AD), the Board of Directors formally elected Dr. Walter Russell Pettigrew as the president of the university and Dr. Wan Yingyuan as the dean of the seminary, purchased 34 acres of land in Yangshupu, Shanghai, and built school buildings. Soochow University, which had been planned for a long time, was finally realized.</p>
<p>2. Progress of school affairs: The formal opening of our school was actually three years before the founding of the Republic of China (1909). At that time, there was only one building, Sihyan Hall, with only six teachers and seven university students and forty-nine middle school students. After that, school buildings continued to be added, teachers were hired year by year, and students also increased every year. By the time of the 10th anniversary in 1916, two new school buildings had been built, the number of teachers had increased to 26, and the number of students had reached 45 in the university and hundreds in the middle school. In 1913, the Hudong Commune was established in the workers' area of ​​Yangshupu, based on the spirit of social education, to benefit the poor workers. In 1916, the departmental system was implemented, and the scale of the university began to take shape. In these years, due to the initial opening, everything was kept simple. Those who were in charge of school administration mostly兼任 teaching positions, and those who were teachers worked hard to assist in school administration. With one heart and one mind, school affairs were able to prosper.</p>
<p>3. The first class of graduates: In June 1913, our school initially decided to hold a graduation ceremony. There were two graduates, one was Dr. Zheng Zhangcheng, who is currently the Dean of the College of Science and the Head of the Department of Biology, and the other was Mr. Wu Zhijian, who is currently a lawyer and was once the Secretary-General of the China Leprosy Relief Association. The two gentlemen have made significant contributions to Chinese science and social undertakings, and are also the pride of our school.</p>
<p>II. From Ten Years to Twenty Years: The Era of Development</p>
<p>1. Construction of new school buildings: During these ten years, the additions to school buildings included the gymnasium, science hall, McGaw Hospital, swimming pool, kindergarten, Syee Hall, upper middle school, and lower middle school. With more school buildings and complete equipment, school affairs became more developed. The former university and middle school, which were combined in one place, were also separated when the upper middle school was completed in 1922.</p>
<p>2. Implementation of the co-educational system: The co-educational system has long been popular in developed countries in Europe and the United States. In China, however, due to the excessive resistance of the old etiquette, it could not be implemented. Our school was the earliest and most vocal in advocating co-education. In 1917, this new plan was passed. In 1920, the first class of female students was enrolled. At that time, people in the community were stuck in old habits, and there were still few female students. Later, due to the promotion of the New Culture Movement, the atmosphere suddenly opened up. The implementation of the co-educational system in our school has gradually achieved results. As a result, schools that followed this system sprung up one after another, and the trend of co-education spread throughout the country.</p>
<p>3. Students' patriotic undertakings: On May 4, 1919, a student movement broke out in Beiping, and students in Shanghai responded to it. On May 30, 1925, the Nanjing Road Massacre occurred in Shanghai, the city was shocked, and the student movement was particularly fierce. It was often reported in the newspapers that other schools were suspended due to this trend. Our school, however, with a spirit of leniency, fulfilled its responsibility of guidance, striving to ensure that patriotism and studying did not contradict each other. Therefore, despite repeated trends, the strings of chanting were still the same.</p>
<p>4. 20th Anniversary: In June 1926, our school held its 20th anniversary celebration, showing its achievements in the past 20 years to the community. Our school is a latecomer among universities in China, but in the past 20 years, it has developed extremely rapidly, and at that time it was on par with advanced schools.</p>
<h3 id="e137">One of the School Scenes: Female Dormitory <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>III. From Twenty Years to Thirty Years: The Era of Innovation</p>
<p>1. The process of registration: In 1928, Dr. Wei Fuland resigned as president, and Dr. Liu Zhanen was elected as president and Mr. Fan Zhengkang as academic dean to implement the policy of Chinese administration of the school. The school worked hard to carry out registration matters. In 1929, it was ordered by the Ministry of Education to be approved for registration, and our school entered a new era.</p>
<p>2. New Development in the New Era: In this new era of ten years, through the efforts of Mr. Liu and Fan, school affairs have become more developed, and the number of students has exceeded the record every year. Latercomers were often rejected due to the full number of dormitories. New school buildings include the library, the middle school auditorium, and the female gymnasium. Under construction are Syee Hall and the University Auditorium. Most of the construction costs are raised in China, which shows that the educational achievements of our school have won the trust of people in the country. The number of teachers and students has also increased year by year, accumulating to this year, and even exceeding the records of previous years</p>
<p>Undergraduate Department: 57 teachers, 627 students (392 males, 235 females)</p>
<p>Middle School Department: 25 teachers, 400 students</p>
<p>Elementary School Department: 5 teachers, 140 students</p>
<p>Hudong Commune: 29 teachers, 752 students</p>
<p>Downtown Business School: 49 teachers, more than 600 students</p>
<p>3. Establishment of the Downtown Business School: Shanghai is the center of Chinese commerce, so the Department of Commerce is the most needed by the local area. Moreover, young professionals who study in their spare time are particularly troubled by the lack of opportunities. In view of this, our school strives to expand the Business School and add a night business school on Yuanmingyuan Road. In 1930, preparations were made. With the support of business leaders, it was formally opened in 1932. It has been five years now, and undergraduate courses, specialized courses, banking and accounting specialized courses, journalism courses, architecture courses, foreign language courses, and special courses have been added one after another. Over the years, the results have been well-received by people in the community.</p>
<p>4. Thoughts of Former President Wei: Former President Dr. Wei Fuland took over as president from Dr. Walter Russell Pettigrew in 1911 and resigned in 1927. He has been in charge of planning and management for 17 years, and has endured great hardships. Our school has what it has today, and Dr. Wei has made a unique contribution. His scholarship and morality have long been admired by all teachers and students of the school. After retiring, Dr. Wei continued to teach philosophy at our school until this year, when he retired to his home country due to old age. In order to reward Dr. Wei's hard work, our school specially built Syee Hall to commemorate him. Dr. Wei also wrote a short history of Soochow University, which describes the development of our school in detail. The materials are comprehensive and the narrative is detailed. It is an important publication of our school.</p>

To engage in research on normal education, such as investigating the actual situation of normal education, collecting materials, publishing books and newspapers, and studying and experimenting on various issues, are all important tasks of the society. 2. To seek to improve normal education, based on research results, to offer suggestions on normal education to the government, and to promote the reform of normal education, in order to establish a sound normal education system, which is the main task of the society. However, this event is a major one, and it is easy for everyone to work together. They will work together with those who are interested in normal education in the country. It is admired that you have made great contributions to the study of normal education. If you are willing to serve as an initiator of the society, we are looking forward to it.

<p>Director Pan's Speech</p>
<p>The Relationship Between Physical Education and Hygiene Education</p>
<p>Speech at the Municipal Physical Education School (Continued)</p>
<p>There is also one point. At present, the promotion of physical education in our country should not only be studied in terms of technology and methods, but also cultivated from living habits, because the rules of people's lives are closely related to hygiene. For example, daily living habits—that is, clothing, food, housing, and transportation—are disorganized, do not follow a fixed time, do not comply with certain rules, and do not follow ideal methods at all. Then, no matter how strong your physical strength is, it will definitely affect hygiene sooner or later, or even inevitably lead to illness. This school wants to become an ideal physical education school, so it is hoped that everyone will deeply understand the items of a new life that is neat, clean, simple, and plain, and practice them personally. I firmly believe that physical education and hygiene are both beneficial, and they "complement each other." Now I still have a little contribution, that is, I said above that physical education is a part of hygiene education. It can also be said that physical education is hygiene, but to talk about hygiene, it is not only from the physical aspect. We should also pay attention to "mental hygiene." In recent years, Western scholars have studied a lot about the theory of mental hygiene—especially in the field of education. Even in our country, a group of educators have recently been promoting it. Originally, a person's health is closely related to psychological mental activity. People's work certainly requires the use of limbs, but from a psychological point of view, it still requires the spirit to dominate everything. If there is something wrong with the mind, and something abnormal occurs, it will naturally affect the health of the body. You must know that the entire body includes "emotion" and "material" aspects. The material activity of the limbs must be directed by the spirit to succeed as a living person. If there is only an empty shell left, then isn't it a "walking corpse" and a "living dead person"? Everyone should see it more broadly. Both "mind" and "body" are included in the word "body." In the past, educational scholars advocated the distinction between moral education, intellectual education, and physical education, but this was only for the convenience of theory. In fact, how can the connection between "mind" and "body" be separated?</p>
<p>Today, I saw a piece of news in a certain newspaper, which was a dispatch from Tokyo, Japan. It said that a fruit store discovered that a truck had been stolen. The police chased after it on bicycles, but the thieves ran very fast. They only caught the thief, who was fleeing on foot, after chasing him for one or two miles. By then, the police were already very tired, but the thief seemed "very indifferent." Later, after investigation, it was found that he was the person who represented the country in international competitions a few years ago and broke the long-distance running record. Judging from this piece of news, it can very well prove that if physical education only pays attention to "special skills" on the sports field and does not work hard on the rationality and character of the mind, it will not only be useless, but may also inevitably lead to many malpractices.</p>
<p>Furthermore, let's talk about Shanghai. In some schools in Shanghai, students sometimes cause trouble. When investigating the troublemakers, it is found that most of them are athletes. Does that mean that athletes can flaunt their power just because they have good skills? Some schools have heard that student athletes can be more free and casual, even skipping classes and receiving special treatment. If this is true, it is too much. The school authorities think that they are the school's athletes and are representing the school to win honor, so they inevitably "worship them like gods," and they also regard themselves as "the pride of the people," doing the most intolerable things of bullying the weak and oppressing the few. If this is not changed for a long time, then advocating physical education seems to be too insulting to the true value of physical education. If principals or coaches treat athletes like this, to put it jokingly, what is the difference between raising dogs at dog tracks and raising horses at racetracks? This kind of rumored misconception must not be allowed to spread, because according to this statement, those who run schools certainly look down on the personality of others, while those who practice sports are also too unambitious. I hope that the Municipal Physical Education School must take the responsibility to correct this kind of wrong mentality and transform the atmosphere of the domestic sports world. Today, I have said a lot of miscellaneous words. I want to hope that the students of the Municipal Physical Education School will understand the national conditions of this country, see clearly the true meaning of the Physical Education School, and pay attention to the cultivation of living habits and mental hygiene at the same time in addition to physical training, so as not to fail the name of "physical education."

<p>Women's Special Issue: How Can One Be a Modern Woman? By Tong Yizhen</p>
<p>Do we dress in 20th-century fashion, carry a few foreign books, or confidently rattle off something or other, and then consider ourselves modern women? No, these are not the crucial questions. To be modern women, we must first approach with a sincere attitude, reflecting on and examining the past, alerting and encouraging the future, and making strong resolutions and efforts to practice the following basic conditions:</p>
<p>1.  Sound Physique</p>
<p>Compared to the physiques of people in Europe and America, we Chinese people feel some fear and shame. This is especially true for us women, and the difference is even more significant. Alas! We can only blame ourselves for not being good in the past, for being infected with the residual poison of being "frail" and having "willow waists and golden lotuses." As a result, we have reached this terrible phenomenon. We must strive to break free from the shackles of near-death and fight against nature. To be modern women, we must first possess the strength of a lion!</p>
<p>2.  Simple Habits</p>
<p>I believe no one can deny that our women's desire for luxury is indeed much greater than that of others. When we look at the customs reports on the import numbers of perfumes and cosmetics, how disheartening they are! In this autumn of national crisis, we bear the responsibility for the rise and fall of the country, and we are busy and inseparable, yet we add a huge leak to the national economy. How can we be worthy of our motherland? To be modern women, we should no longer be as flamboyantly decorated as flowers. Although "the love of beauty is in everyone's nature," what we need is simple beauty. We must recognize that perfumes, cosmetics, and all decorative items are only for outdated people. We should abandon these things far away.</p>
<p>3.  Independent Spirit</p>
<p>For decades, we have been shouting "freedom and equality" every day. Although we have gained the sympathy of some people, we are still heavily oppressed in reality. The most fundamental reason we seek is that economic independence is not possible. Because from ancient times to the present, we have been poisoned by the dependence of "marrying a chicken and following a chicken, marrying a dog and following a dog." To be modern women, we must have an independent spirit. No one can rely on anyone else to seek true "freedom and equality!"</p>
<p>Finally, I hope all female compatriots in the country will become modern women and shoulder the mission of saving the country and seeking survival!</p>
<p>A Unique Woman in American Journalism By Caoshi</p>
<p>America is a paradise for women. Anything a man can do, a woman can do as well. However, the job of "war correspondent," which is the most demanding, and requires facing death and enduring countless dangers, seems unsuitable for women due to the environment and their inherent nature. Unexpectedly, in 1914, when the European War was just beginning, Margarita Evira MUGARRIETA, the daughter of the first Mexican consul in San Francisco, who was a woman's magazine reporter, secretly disguised herself as a man named Mr. Jack Bee GARLAND. At the age of 35, she went to the European Western Front, personally went deep into the front lines within the fire line, to collect war reports, in order to complete the mission of a special correspondent for a major American news conglomerate. Garland's intention was deeply rooted in the belief that the scope of women's magazines was too small, and that it was not enough to smoothly pursue a lifetime career. She took advantage of the good opportunity of the European War to express her ambitions and pursue a more distant and greater ambition. Afterwards, when the European War ended, Mr. Garland returned to the country in a flamboyant manner, wearing a high collar, smoking large cigars, and driving a small car, frequenting bars where male reporters gathered. For 22 years, no one had ever uncovered her true identity. She has written articles on the war in Africa against the Rif people against Spain, the dispute between the two South American countries of Peru and Bolivia, and the recent Italian expedition to the African country of Ethiopia. Her person has long been proven in the field, and has become an expert in war affairs in the journalism field. Everyone knows that he is Mr. Garland, who is very knowledgeable, and has long developed a natural tendency. It was not until Mr. Garland passed away in early September of this year that his close friend, Miss George SHADBURNE, revealed his special behavior. This is truly an unprecedented secret in American news history, similar to the words of novelists and myths.</p>
<p>It is said that Ms. Huang Nuting, the daughter of Huang Jieqing, the former acting Spanish envoy to our country, also dressed as a man, following the example of the unique people in the American news industry. Could it be said to be one of a kind?</p>
<p>The Physique of Japan's Maehata By Jiyun</p>
<p>The Japanese swimmer Hideshi Maehata, who returned from the World Games, displayed her amazing performance in Berlin, leaving hundreds of thousands of spectators with a good impression of Japanese women's sports. She not only lived up to the hard work of her daily practice, but also completed her mission. Not to mention women, even men, being diligent in sports is enough to develop their physique. Conversely, amazing athletic achievements must have amazing physiques. The physical fitness of our country's athletes who attended the World Games has already lagged behind. It is more shameful that the results of this sport are poor. Except for specialized gymnastics schools, girls' schools not only do not pay attention to the students' sports, but can be said to have no regard for the physical fitness of girls. The physical examination during the entrance examination is also just a formality. How many physical education instructors pay attention to whether the students' physical fitness is improving or declining? The general public's observation of women's physical fitness only focuses on the beauty of curves and the beauty of the human body. If they are not slender and graceful, they are round and plump, which is fundamentally wrong. In this extremely difficult national situation, we do not need the physical fitness of movie stars and dance queens, but only truly healthy women to be the mothers of small citizens in the future.</p>
<p>After Hideshi Maehata returned from the World Games, Ms. Shigeyo Takeuchi examined her physique and discovered amazing results. Her height is 1.602 meters, which is taller than the average height of Japanese men. (The average height of Japanese men is longest between the ages of 30 and 35, only 1.60 meters.) Her weight is 58.5 kilograms, which is also heavier than men (the average weight of Japanese men is heaviest between the ages of 40 and 45, 57 kilograms). Her chest circumference is 90.48 centimeters, her shoulder width is 41.2 centimeters, her waist width is 29.3 centimeters, and her skin thickness is 1.4 centimeters. Her lower limb length is 85 centimeters, her back muscle strength is 108 kilograms, her arm span is 1.668 meters, her lung capacity is 4,000 cubic centimeters, and her chest circumference ratio is 58 kilograms.</p>
<p>The characteristics of Maehata's physique are that her arm span is 10 centimeters longer than the standard, her lung capacity is almost twice that of ordinary people, and her back muscle strength is 20 kilograms stronger than her total muscle strength. The chest circumference ratio is the ratio of chest circumference to height, and this is what Japanese women lack compared to Western women. The standard chest circumference ratio for Western women is 55%, and Maehata has now surpassed it. Although not all Japanese women have this kind of special and excellent physique like Maehata, perhaps our Chinese women have never had this kind of healthy physique. But generally speaking, the physical fitness of women in China and Japan is very different. Because women in our country do not pay attention to exercise on weekdays, their physical fitness cannot develop. Not only is there no hope for excellent sports results, but even domestic affairs, labor service, production and education are all significantly affected. Readers can understand this after comparing their own or their children's physical fitness with Maehata's physical fitness.</p>
<p>Women's Issues in Ballads By Baling</p>
<p>"The small drum is round and round, my mother beats me, how pitiful. I am my mother's floating heart grass, staying at home for a few years. I sweep the ground for other people, I burn incense for other people's Buddha, I call other people's mother 'Mom'. Her mother asks her what she eats? She says: Cooked tofu in a pot, rice to eat."</p>
<p>"Cabbage leaves, covering the ground, my mother gave birth to me, not strong enough; I ate my mother's milk since I was a child, and when I grow up, I serve other people's mother; other people eat rice, I eat bran, other people eat noodles, I drink soup; I'm so thirsty and miserable, I run to the backyard and cry a scene. The whip hits my body, I jump off a cliff, the cliff is deep: I jump into a well, the well water is small: I cling to the well bridge and take a look, I see the willow tips of my mother's house, willow tips, magpies are calling, who knows my grievance?"</p>
<p>The above two ballads are very popular in northern China. After reading them, we deeply feel how pitiful a miserable woman is who unfortunately becomes someone else's maid.</p>
<p>Indeed, we are all the same kind of human beings, why is it that on the one hand, one can enjoy as much as possible and not think it is strange? On the other hand, one has to bow down and serve, and be subjected to extreme abuse and oppression everywhere? This is human inequality, and it is indeed a distorted state in current society.</p>
<p>"Rescue the maids, ban the custody of maids." These two slogans have been chanted by the leaders of the women's world and those who care about women's issues in the past. Moreover, the government has also issued orders, but in fact, tens of thousands of maids have not been rescued and liberated. What a pitiful and urgent thing to rescue!</p>
<p>"Save the maids and free them from the sea of ​​suffering as soon as possible!" This is the cry revealed in their own ballads, and it is also a problem that the women's world cannot ignore.</p>
<p>Mother's Love By Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>The child's eyes do not yet contain the mother, but the mother's love already contains the child.</p>
<p>The mother has long held a passionate love for her child. When the child is still gestating, the mother has had many beautiful dreams for the child. She dreams of the child's bright eyes, apple-colored cheeks, lotus root-like limbs... The child in her dream is so lively and lovely! Although the mother often suffers from mental trance and physical discomfort for the sake of the child.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the mother hopes that her child will be born sooner, on the other hand, she hopes that her child will not be as stupid as the children she has seen before, so as not to betray her expectations; finally, on a stormy night, the mother's abdomen cramps, the mother's fresh blood flows, and the child falls to the ground with a cry.</p>
<p>In the child's ignorant cry, a smile appears on the mother's face. She wants to put the child beside her, watching the child from time to time. She is like a painter who has completed his masterpiece, only appreciating his masterpiece with satisfaction, and forgetting the hard work he spent in painting the masterpiece.</p>
<p>However, the mother's hard work has not yet ended. She must feed the child with milk at all times, and she must always consider the child's cold and warmth; sometimes when the child is sick, she becomes even more upset and loses her appetite and sleep! She must wait until the child's illness is cured before her heart can be at peace.</p>
<p>As the child gradually grows up, the mother's expectations for the child also increase with age, because the mother's love for the child is also accumulated deeper and deeper; if the child is weak and incompetent, then the mother's efforts will be in vain. Wouldn't she fall into the abyss of despair!</p>
<p>Although the child is now gradually growing up, his development is not yet sound, and his wisdom is not yet sufficient. In addition to the mother's love, the bad environment may also be in danger of corrupting him.</p>
<p>So how should the child strive for his own future? How should he cherish his life? How should he repay his mother's love... All of these depend on the child's heart, and wait for the child to answer with facts in the future.</p>
<p>Feminine Virtue and Feminine Appearance</p>
<p>Another Column: Epitaph for Zheng's Mother, Madam Hong By Chen Baozhen</p>
<p>Yongchun's Zheng Yushe formerly served in my ministry. This autumn, he came to Beijing to visit, presented the biography of Madam Hong, and requested an epitaph, tearfully saying: Yu Shu was born five years before my mother passed away. At that time, my late father was still traveling. Yu Shu and his younger brothers Yu Lin and Xiang Lin were young. The ceremony of decorating the end was mostly incomplete. After my late father's death, my mother's life was recorded in the epitaph written by Mr. Wu Zengqi, but my mother's family was not detailed. My mother has no extraordinary deeds. What Yu Shu knows and can describe are all ordinary things within the family. If I can obtain your words, describing what Mr. Wu did not mention, so that the Zheng family can follow it as a model for women for generations, then my mother will not die. According to the biography, the Madam was from the Hong family of Nan'an, the granddaughter of the Grand Master Jiang Huai, who was granted the title of Grand Master of Central Administration, and the daughter of Zheng Zhijing, a member of the local gentry. At the age of ten, she married Zheng Jun Yuanru. At that time, Grand Master Jiang Huai was a commercial magnate in the county, known as a rich man. The Madam grew up in a prestigious family and was physically weak and prone to illness. Her parents-in-law treated her with consideration and did not allow her to do hard work. The Madam said: A woman has a duty, how dare I shirk it. In addition to serving her parents-in-law every morning and evening, she personally handled everything from large events such as sacrifices and banquets to small tasks such as cooking and washing. Her father-in-law once suffered from a carbuncle on his neck, and she applied medicine twice a day and provided nourishing tonics before dawn for six months without fail. At that time, her parents passed away in succession, so she took in her younger brothers and sisters and raised them with care. People said that it was rare to see a married daughter be so attentive to her father's family, which showed the sincerity of her nature. She got up early to supervise her children's studies and prepared meals for the tutors at night, often doing it herself. When there were wind and rain, she would share food with the attached scholars. Her family affairs were already busy, but relatives often asked her to help with needlework, and she could not bear to refuse. She treated herself very frugally; because she was sick, her relatives gave her ginseng from overseas, but she would always share it with her family. Her silk and brocade were plentiful, but she often wore mended clothes. She worked hard and rested little, and she often suffered from dizziness. When it occurred, she would lie in bed and refuse to eat or drink, but after a short while, she would force herself to get up and take care of things as usual, which showed the decisiveness of her conduct. In the Guangxu year of Xin Chou, her uncle, Wei Ting, passed away without illness. The brothers of Yuanru were not home as guests, and his sister-in-law was in labor, so she took on all the internal and external affairs. In the end, she fell ill from overwork, and then cried for her deceased daughter, which made her even more unable to support herself. Initially, the Grand Madam had arranged for Yu Shu to marry a daughter of the Hong family. At this time, knowing that she would not recover, she held Yu Shu's hand and said to him: Since I became a member of your family for more than ten years, I have been fortunate enough to avoid mistakes. Now your generation has not yet been established, and my daughter-in-law will not see me, it is the will of Heaven! She cried out. Not long after, she passed away, at the age of only thirty-five. Yu Shu also said that more than two years after his mother passed away, Yu Shu married and became a student of the local school. More than a year later, he had a son. When he entered the officialdom, he welcomed his father to the post and missed his mother's hard work even more, so he had a pavilion built next to the tomb and named it "Thinking of Mother," but the wishes of both mother and son are all deeply sad. I believe that a person's son has a heart that cannot bear to let his parents die, so filial piety and love will last forever, so what space is there between the living and the dead? Now, although the Madam did not enjoy a long life, her descendants are prosperous, and her reward is in her afterlife. Heaven's praise of virtue is not false. I use this to comply with Zheng Sheng's request and write it on the tomb, so that those who cultivate feminine virtue will not doubt the principle of good fortune. In the month of Zhongqiu of the year of Zhangdun Zang, Chen Baozhen of Min County wrote it.</p>
<p>Xi Ge By Xueying</p>
<p>Whenever I walk to a place with bamboo, I often think of the large bamboo garden at my sixth aunt's house and the many unique square bamboos planted on the flower stand in her courtyard. Indeed, bamboo seems to be a specialty or a trademark in their family. Whenever people talk about Sixth Aunt or anyone in her family, I would immediately think of bamboo. At that time, I was still young, so of course I didn't know how to appreciate the charm of bamboo and the integrity it represents. I only felt that going to their house in the hot summer seemed cooler than other places, but going there in autumn or winter seemed particularly desolate. I didn't know anything else.</p>
<p>In a study surrounded by bamboo, there were often only two people lingering there. One was my uncle—the son of Sixth Aunt—and the other was Xi Ge, his son. Xi Ge was a very stubborn young man with great courage. He often stayed alone in that old study, which was two or three hundred steps away from the main house; but he didn't like to study. He liked gymnastics and sports very much. His personality was close to the martial arts side, so he was not loved by his uncle, who regarded himself as a "family of scholars," even though he was an only son. Later, probably because his personality was too stubborn, his uncle couldn't resist him, so he let him enter the military academy, and after graduating, he immediately officially enlisted in the army. Because he had enlisted in the army, I remember that every time a civil war broke out or a bandit suppression mobilization was held, his uncle and aunt were most worried. They would send someone to buy newspapers early every day, busy trying to find out if the 62nd Division to which Xi Ge belonged had participated. Fortunately, Xi Ge served as a soldier for five years, starting as a platoon leader and rising to the rank of battalion commander. In terms of seniority, he was also a lieutenant colonel. He probably returned to his hometown once every year, and each time his uniform seemed more spirited than the last, but his stubborn personality remained unchanged.</p>
<p>This summer, I suddenly received a message that Xi Ge was dead. How did he die? Was he killed in battle? No, he committed suicide. At that time, I was very shocked, so I inquired carefully from all sides, and finally learned the details of the matter.</p>
<p>It turned out that his troops were ordered to move to a small coastal county in the spring. This was a place where warships of a certain country often appeared. Many soldiers on the ships openly went ashore to take pictures or draw maps. The previous garrison often dealt with them with an attitude of trying to avoid trouble, so nothing happened. When Xi Ge arrived there, the same thing happened again after a few months. How could he tolerate it? He immediately ordered his troops to capture several soldiers from a certain country and also destroyed their cameras and the maps they had drawn. Then he released them. Unexpectedly, the next morning, soldiers from a certain country brought a number of small sampans, and fifty or sixty of them landed, also carrying ample weapons. They were obviously looking for trouble. Xi Ge was not afraid at all, and lined up his troops to wait in formation outside the city, which scared them back. Xi Ge thought that the matter must have come to an end, but who knew that half a month later, another battalion of officers and soldiers suddenly came to take over the defense. Because Xi Ge was surprised by their sudden arrival, he asked the new battalion commander; this person honestly told him that because of the protest of a certain country, their division commander had taken the blame, and his immediate superior—Commander Dong—had taken the responsibility for this matter himself because of his teacher-student relationship with him, and quietly resigned. Now, as long as he is transferred, there will be no problem. Xi Ge was extremely indignant after hearing this, and immediately shot himself in the camp headquarters. None of his subordinates knew that he was not crying: and this heroic and promising young military officer lightly sacrificed himself under his own stubborn personality.</p>
<p>The bamboo, with its straightness and joints, symbolizes him.</p>
<p>This Newspaper's Special Feature: Ms. Yang Jinxun Talks About Aviation Life By Ping</p>
<p>Learning Elementary Flight</p>
<p>One Must Seek Further Education</p>
<p>To Repay the Motherland</p>
<p>Women Learning Aviation</p>
<p>More Suitable Than the Army and Navy</p>
<p>I Hope Everyone Will Work Hard</p>
<p>"The drums are thumping, drumming up the courage of our soldiers. One drum thunders, the second drum mountains roar, and the third drum waves surge!..." This is the most magnificent section of the military song I sang in the Boy Scout troop when I was young. It is deeply imprinted in my mind and will never be erased; now that the national crisis is becoming more urgent and the bandits and puppets are invading Suiyuan again, thinking of the scenes at the front, I hum this old tune involuntarily. Indeed, when the healthy sons and daughters of China mention national affairs, who does not feel their blood surging and want to do something loyal and brave to save the country? Men are like this, and women are no exception! The day before yesterday, I visited Miss Yang Jinxun and talked about many things, which were very practical and pertinent, and could serve as a wake-up call for modern women! She is a member of the China Flying Society and has long placed her aspirations in the aviation industry. After six months of training, she can already fly alone, which is certainly no easy task. The following is our dialogue:</p>
<p>According to my observation, Ms. Yang is young, but she is quite experienced in her words and deeds. Her attitude is sincere and dignified, and her will is strong and calm. At first, she was unwilling to express any opinions. She said, "I feel very small and my knowledge is very superficial, so I am not qualified to speak publicly." I said, "Don't be too modest. Coming from thousands of miles away like you, learning aviation and sacrificing all enjoyment is truly rare among modern women. Even if you don't brag about yourself, you should win glory for women." After repeated explanations, she finally allowed me to briefly describe her personal wishes.</p>
<p>First, she introduced her background: "I am originally from Changsha, Hunan. I am twenty-five years old this year. My parents are both healthy, and I have two younger brothers and two younger sisters. My family all lives in Wuchang. In the winter of 1929, I graduated from the Normal Department of Hunan Provincial No. 2 Middle School. In the past seven years, in order to make a living, I have wandered to many places, but unemployment and poverty have accompanied me most of the time. But these experiences have been of great help and benefit to me. At the same time, it has given me a lot of life experience and knowledge. To temper oneself in a difficult life is something that school education cannot provide. In the past, I have worked as a tutor, civil servant, typist, and library administrator, etc. These jobs were for life, not my own aspirations; my lifelong aspiration is still in aviation.</p>
<p>"When did you have the motivation to learn aviation?" "I have a great interest in aviation. Ever since I saw an airplane, I wanted to learn to fly. In the past, I just wanted to fly, but now I understand why I want to fly. I remember the 'January 28th' Songhu War. That year, I had just left Shanghai and was living in Peiping. Although I did not personally experience that war, I had the same tense heartstrings. Every day, I read the Shen Bao, and I only felt more depressed. The bombs in my heart were really about to explode! The enemy's planes came to our country at will to drop bombs, while our compatriots used their blood and flesh to fight. Tens of millions of people's heads and bodies were turned into meat sauce under the bombs, and they even didn't know where to go. Not to mention buildings. These impressions left us not with sadness, but with anger! What will happen if we gather everyone's anger and explode it? That is something that cannot be easily imagined, but this thing that cannot be easily imagined will one day show its true face. Therefore, I prepared myself and decided to learn to fly, as the only goal in my technical training!"</p>
<p>Sketch—Ms. Yang</p>
<p>"How is your interest after joining the Flying Society?"</p>
<p>"There are only two female members in our society who are learning to fly, me and Miss Chen, but I believe that there must be many women who want to learn. I hope that women can account for a considerable number in the second phase of enrollment. In other countries' flight training classes, women are enthusiastically participating, and women also have various new records in the history of aviation. Can't the Chinese women's world produce aviation talents? We are naturally unwilling to lag behind. Taking advantage of the current government's promotion of aviation and the people's support, I hope everyone will work hard! In another month or so, we will graduate. This is only learning elementary flight. To serve the air force, we need more rigorous training. According to my experience in the past six months, I deeply feel that flying is not an extremely difficult thing. As long as you cultivate an indestructible body, have a fighting spirit</p>

<p>*The Shanghai News*, This City Supplement, *Ling Shu Jing* and *Su Wen*, Dr. Liu Xinbai, Main Answers, Red, Swollen, Toxic Conditions, No. 98, Mr. Yi Dongfan from the Third District Section of the Zhejiang Yuyao Andong City Liangzhe Salt Affairs Tax Police asks: The enemy has a sore, not quite a sore, not quite a boil, three inches above and slightly to the side of the back of the left knee, which is difficult for Western doctors to diagnose. Here are the various possible causes: It started like a grain of rice, feeling painful and itchy, so I applied an ordinary drawing salve made by a national medicine shop. The next day it broke and bled a little. Because the salve was too sticky, the surrounding skin became slightly red and swollen. I changed the salve for three days in a row without any effect. Then I used a Chinese medicine prescription with the following ingredients (dragon bone, sea floating soda, yellow sublimation pill, borneol), ground into a fine powder and applied it once a day. It felt even more painful, and I saw pus flowing out, but the skin continued to rot. Then I switched to 914 ointment, but it still didn't work. Instead, the surrounding area gradually rotted more, and the hole became two-tenths of an inch deep. Although I can walk a little, I have to walk with a limp, and it hurts a lot. I live in a coastal area with no good doctors or medicine. Please advise: (1) Is it a malignant carbuncle or boil? (2) Will it spread and rot permanently? (3) What should I avoid eating and what can I eat? (4) What medicine can I use to completely restore the area to its original condition? (5) Please teach me the most effective medicine. Answer: (1) It is a carbuncle. (2) Yes. (3) Avoid tobacco and alcohol. (4) First, ask a doctor to inject two shots of "Novargo" intramuscularly (inject every other day). Dilute "Trisal" with water 30 times, soak cotton and wipe the wound clean. Sprinkle "Iodoform" (use this medicine carefully, not too much) into the wound. Then, use a large piece of flannel, spread a one-third inch thick layer of "Sanfloid" on it, heat it slightly over a fire and apply it. Change it once a day. (5) See (4).</p>

Afterwards, I was normal. When I wake up, I feel phlegm rattling in my throat, which causes coughing and sometimes choking. This condition has continued for three years. Please tell me (1) what is the illness? (2) What medicine should I take? Answer: (1) There is a suspicion of lung disease. Without an examination, it is difficult to say for sure.

<p>No. 100, Mr. Kang Bihang, No. 38, Yongheng Company, Ningbo Road, asks: I was born with only one testicle, located on the left side. It is commonly said that people with only one testicle, although it does not affect fertility, can only have either sons or daughters, not both. In the above condition, there is also a hernia on the right side, which caused severe pain yesterday. I discovered this condition when I was young, and it has been swelling year by year, and recently it has become as large as a peach, and I fear it will continue to grow. Please tell me (1) is it true that people with one testicle cannot have both sons and daughters? (2) Is there a cure? (3) What medicine should I take for the hernia to be effective? (4) Do I need to stay in the hospital for long-term treatment? Answer: (1) The sex of the fetus is determined several months after it is formed, and the relationship with the initial sperm is still unclear, but this saying is definitely incorrect. (2) I will know after an examination. If it is a hidden testicle, surgery can cure it. (3) A hernia is a structural disease, and medicine is ineffective. (4) This disease also requires surgery. You need to stay in the hospital after surgery, but you do not need long-term treatment.</p>

<p>No. 101, Mr. Deng Yong, No. 9, Lane 301, Rugao Road, Hongkou, asks: I previously wrote to you about my illness, and I am very grateful for your reply. Now I have several more questions. My condition is as follows: I have been diagnosed with bronchiectasis. I cough up three to four hundred cc of thick phlegm every day. I don't cough now, and I don't have tuberculosis. My spirits are generally good, and I don't have a fever. It's just the thick phlegm. I have to cough it up every day by noon, otherwise I feel very uncomfortable in my trachea, and I can even hear the sound of phlegm when I breathe. If I exert myself too much, then the phlegm feels a little more. But other than the phlegm, I have no other illnesses. What do I do every day? I take walks in the garden, but I don't do any exercise. I sleep from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m., and I take clear cod liver oil three times a day. I go to bed around 8 p.m. every night and get up around 6 a.m. Now I have several questions for you: (1) Will this condition often cause me to cough up blood? (2) What are the dangers if I cough up blood? (3) How can I prevent coughing up blood? (4) How should I treat it if I cough up blood? (5) Can I read, work, and exercise with this disease? (6) Is the work I am doing now suitable? (7) My development is still good now. I wonder if this disease can be cured in the future? (8) Is my stuffy nose related to my bronchiectasis? Answer: (1) No. (2) See (1). (3) Take "Sinocalcin" ten times a day, one tablet every hour. (4) See (1). (5) Light exercise is okay. (6) Suitable. (7) It can be cured naturally by gradually strengthening the body, but the effect is unpredictable. (8) Unrelated.</p>

When it occurs, she coughs frequently and produces a lot of phlegm. Please explain (1) is it caused by physical weakness? (2) What medicine should I take? (3) Is it lung disease?

<p>No. 103, Mr. Yang Guanzong, No. 4 Seymour Road, asks: I unfortunately developed the habit of masturbation when I was young, so I have suffered from seminal emission in recent years—severe cases occur once a week. I have taken many kinds of seminal emission pills on the market, but they cannot cure the root cause, only temporarily stop it. So after the medicine is finished, if there is a slight stimulus, it will recur. I previously read in your doctor's Q&amp;A column that taking "Bronmagsin" can cure it. So I request your guidance: (1) Is "Bronmagsin" a pill or a liquid, where can I buy it, how much does it cost, and how much should I take to be completely cured? (2) Are insomnia and facial acne related to this? (3) Will my memory recover after I am cured, and how long will it take? (4) Will this medicine also be effective for premature ejaculation? Answer: (1) "Bronmagsin" is a liquid, and all pharmacies sell it. Please inquire with the pharmacy about the price. "How much should I take to be completely cured?" Please read the package insert. (2) Insomnia is a symptom of neurasthenia and is related to masturbation and seminal emission. This medicine is effective. Facial acne (pimples) is caused by increased sebum secretion during puberty and is not related to masturbation and seminal emission. This medicine is ineffective. (3) Memory may be slightly better after the illness is cured. (4) Effective.</p>

<p>No. 104, Mr. Ding Yifu, No. 75 Hart Road, asks: Because my body has been unhealthy since I was young, I have felt uneasy sleep since I was fifteen or sixteen. By the time I was twenty, I knew I had insomnia. Later, due to life problems, I changed jobs, and my sleep gradually improved. However, because I am engaged in cultural work and tend to use my brain, my insomnia comes and goes. After I got married at the age of twenty-three, my insomnia became even worse; and I ejaculated as soon as I had intercourse, with no sexual pleasure at all. Fortunately, the time I spent with my wife was not long, and we often separated; otherwise, my body would be even weaker. Before coming to Shanghai—that is, during the period when I lived with my wife—I had to write articles because I was working for a newspaper, and I suffered from insomnia for more than ten days. Even if it wasn't complete insomnia, it was only a state of semi-sleep, as if I knew and didn't know, as if I was dreaming and not dreaming. Since coming to Shanghai in May of this year, my insomnia has been less because I don't write as much. The reason is probably because I meditate for half an hour every morning and evening—before going to bed and after getting up—and because I changed places and don't use my brain as much. However, there are occasional nights of complete insomnia, but not as bad as before. Recently, after reading a little, my symptoms of restless sleep have returned in the past half month. I am a mental laborer. If I don't read or write, I have nothing to eat, and there are many injustices that force me to write. Please tell me (1) how should I treat this situation? (2) I want to take a brain tonic for a long time that is convenient and economical. What medicine should I use? (3) Are there any other natural treatments? Answer: (1) Adjust your lifestyle. Get up early in the morning and go to bed early at night. Do not use your brain after 6 p.m. Do moderate exercise during the day (such as walking, pulling a spring). Taking a warm bath before going to bed is effective. In addition, there is climate therapy. Move to a moderately high altitude or seaside. If the environment permits, you may want to try it. The most important thing is to clear all distracting thoughts before going to bed. Reciting the Heart Sutra once is very good (of course, everyone has their own beliefs and cannot be forced. And it is inappropriate for a scientist to introduce religion. But our reason for opposing religion is because science is making progress, and the theories of gods and ghosts can no longer control the minds of modern people. But if you can see through the inner side of religion, you will know that there is still profound philosophy in it. Who can say that I am superstitious if I read the Heart Sutra with the eye of a philosopher?). (2) You can take "Bromagsin." This medicine is a central nervous system sedative and is harmless for long-term use. I will not introduce hypnotic drugs that can be addictive. (3) See (1) and avoid drinking tea, coffee, and alcohol.</p>

<p>No. 105, Mr. Wang Shencong asks: I liked to go out and have fun before I got married, but I don't know if I ever had syphilis. I only feel a dull pain in my bones when it is cloudy and rainy. This spring I gave birth to a daughter who is very weak and has been sick every day since she was born. And she has two special characteristics: she often develops various kinds of rashes on her body, and she has a piece of extra flesh on her anus. In addition, her eyes are sensitive to light and tear when exposed to wind, and her teeth (one pair) are not aligned. Please tell me (1) what is the disease? (2) What are the rashes that often appear on her body? (3) Why are her eyes sensitive to light? (4) Why are her teeth not aligned? (5) Is there any danger if she is not treated?

(2) Children with congenital syphilis often develop rashes on their bodies, such as small pustular rashes, eczema, roseola, smallpox, and papules. (3) The big one is iritis. (4) "Hutchinson's teeth." (5) The prognosis is poor if she is not treated. (6) Inject "606" and "Merson." The former is one injection per week (0.15), and the latter is one injection every three days.

<p>談言從「人言可畏」說開去</p>
<h3 id="e150">Talking about "Fear of Human Words" <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>By Zinan</p>
<p>After Miss Ruan Lingyu was killed by the old moral code and yellow journalism, she left a suicide note saying "Fear of Human Words." In addition to making us feel sad and mourn the loss of a generation of artists, it also made us understand that yellow journalism can be used as a weapon to kill the weak.</p>
<p>However, when the remains of the weak are not yet displayed in the hall, yellow journalism is also called "public opinion." After the matter is over, it is still called "public opinion," until the second tragedy reappears, and the murdered person must be somewhat prestigious in society, attracting the attention of people in society. Otherwise, committing suicide quietly because of a piece of yellow journalism is equivalent to the death of a dog.</p>
<p>Naturally, the murdered person is a weak person. Otherwise, he would never obediently lower his head and submit to others.</p>
<p>Recently, the French Minister of the Interior, Sarraut, also committed suicide because he was slandered by right-wing newspapers.</p>
<p>Sarraut was a socialist and had written many political commentaries. In theory, he should not have committed suicide. Although his political opponents' newspapers slandered him by saying that he "deserted during the European War," wasn't he "proven innocent" after investigation? Since he has been proven innocent, from the opposite point of view, it fully exposes the other party's shameless slander, and he has suffered no loss to his personality and reputation.</p>
<p>However, Sarraut finally committed suicide. This cannot but make us call him a weakling.</p>
<p>A socialist, a warrior, should show his courage even more when attacked by the enemy. This battle is not only for himself, but also for the masses. Fortunately, Sarraut's suicide occurred after the truth was revealed. Otherwise, wouldn't it give the enemy a better excuse for "suicide out of fear of punishment"?</p>
<p>If it is said that his suicide was for family matters, because his wife passed away eighteen months ago, his old mother's health was weakened after surgery recently, coupled with this decisive slander, he "felt that life was meaningless." The situation is true, and a person of flesh and blood always has his emotions, but is suicide a solution to the problem? What's more, a warrior only has the qualifications to kill and be killed, and has no right to commit suicide.</p>
<p>However, Sarraut committed suicide. In this regard, he showed his weakness and lost the heroic spirit of a warrior.</p>
<p>Speaking of killing, it is naturally inevitable in national disputes, but it must be done with a clear attitude. If you play tricks, fabricate rumors, and rely on cold arrows to hurt people and win victory, then even if you rely on cold arrows and slander to make the other party fall, victory is still slim. The reason is very clear. Cold arrows can only be hidden in dark corners, shooting a few arrows secretly. To openly charge into battle, you can't use it. And the decision of victory can only be seen in the melee of charging into battle.</p>
<p>Cold arrows can naturally shoot down a few people sometimes, but most of those who are shot are weak. After being shot by an arrow, they will fall to the ground and be unable to get up again. Even if they only hurt some skin, after the injury heals, they will always think that they have become disabled. The strong are different. Even if they are hit by a dark arrow, they will heal their wounds and fight again, and the cold arrow will increase his anger, and he will fight even more desperately.</p>
<p>The difference between the weak and the strong is probably in these places.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Thoughts on "Sai Jinhua" <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>By Mosi</p>
<p>I am glad to see "Sai Jinhua" being staged.</p>
<p>Although the subject matter of "Sai Jinhua" is a fact from thirty-six years ago, because this fact is almost the same as the current situation with foreign enemies invading and traitors selling the country, we do not feel that this is a historical drama, but rather a drama about our generation. Naturally, after seeing the ugly state of high-ranking officials bowing down to foreigners, we cannot ignore the playwright's enlightenment to us about Sai Jinhua: "It is useless to save the country for the traitors!"</p>
<p>A script with such national defense significance is very necessary to stage at the moment when the national crisis has reached the point of life and death.</p>
<p>Regarding the production of "Sai Jinhua," I feel that the playwright has "cinematized" it. It is so, unfolding scene by scene. If it were on the screen, it would indeed provide the director with easy and concise assistance. But, on the stage it is different. The more scenes there are, the more the scenery etc.</p>
<p>Page 20</p>
<p>cost. And the separation of time to change the scenery every time will cause the audience to interrupt their spirit during the performance. I don't think it is a good way to divide the number of acts too much.</p>
<p>In fact, the third scene can be omitted. The drama before this scene originally only exposed the violence of the Allied forces. But this point can be explained in a few lines of dialogue in the fourth scene.</p>
<p>The performance has not changed much from the original work. It's just that the first part of the movie is missing. Lantern slides were used to show subtitles such as "1900 (the 26th year of Guangxu, Gengzi) in Beijing" as "a comic illustration in a tragic era," with the sound of cannons and yellow smoke being set off in front of the curtain. The curtain fell. Although this is not as good as the original, it is better than nothing.</p>
<p>Regarding the entire performance, I think what they worked hardest on was the costumes, scenery, and props. It is indeed not easy to be able to do this.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because the time to prepare for the performance was too rushed! Every actor's lines were not memorized well. If the lines are too raw, it will cause the dialogue to lack emotion and hinder the acting, and it will affect the tempo of the tune.</p>
<p>Because of the raw lines, the things on the stage seemed to lack emotion. Yes, some dialogues can also elicit laughter from the audience, but this is the success of the lines themselves. Such as: "The emperor only allows us to study. We can't do anything else besides studying." "The slave only knows how to kowtow, to kowtow to the foreigners!"</p>

<h3 id="e152">Wang Ying as Sai Jinhua <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The most significant impact of this shortcoming on the script is in the fifth scene. The negotiations between Li Hongzhang and Waldersee are very important, but they do not show a sense of tension.</p>
<p>The director handled the seventh scene the best. The stage of that scene has a northern flavor. For example, Sun San came on stage to report that Sai Erye could not be rescued. Sun San took the package to leave, and we saw the competition between him and Gu Ma through the crack in the door curtain. Sun San escaped, heard the horse chirping, and then said that even Sai Erye's iron leather Qing was taken away. Sai Jinhua first called Gu Ma outside the door before coming on stage. These are all very good. The relatively poor one is the third scene, which is too hasty, making the audience unable to grasp any impression.</p>
<p>The actors do have many commendable things in their acting skills. However, restricted by the fact that they did not memorize their lines well, they could not develop to the fullest extent. Wang Ying's Sai Jinhua was quite good in the seventh scene. Unfortunately, she was overshadowed by Xia Xia's lively movements and vivid lines. In the fourth scene, Sai Jinhua was not enthusiastic enough when she met Waldersee, and she seemed too cold to attract Waldersee. I always feel that Wang Ying's actions cannot express the alertness of Sai Jinhua's character. Jinshan's Li Hongzhang is not bad in terms of acting skills. But his aura is not enough. The director gave him the best position in the fifth act, and he tried his best to perform, but he was too showy. Mei Xi was very good in the first scene. As for the others, those who went from the screen to the stage, Wang Xianzai's lines were not natural enough, Zhang Yi's body was good enough, but his voice was not loud enough, and Sun Min's acting was appropriate.</p>
<p>The makeup is very successful.</p>
<p>However, the lighting is too bad. The top lights are not bright enough, there are no footlights, the sidelights are too weak, and they are shaking. The two Sport Lights upstairs are sometimes bright and sometimes dark, moving east and west. I don't know why?</p>
<p>Stage management also lacks organization.</p>
<p>Overall, this performance feels like the fruit of mature art.</p>

<p>By Luo Yu</p>
<p>"What was the reason for smashing the house? Would people like you do it?" I asked him, walking behind him on the narrow embankment. He seemed very touched, turned his head, and raised his eyebrows very high.</p>
<p>"You may not believe it, yes, it wasn't like usual. Our family went as one person, as if we had mustered up the courage and were not afraid of anything." He looked again at the embankment in front of him and below, and then said: "Yang Jingtai has a tile house - you can't find such a grand tile house in Tianjin. The chimney is decorated with a bell, like a small pavilion. The yard has a carved wooden corridor and a paved path of square bricks. The houses are even taller than the buildings, but now it has become broken bricks."</p>
<p>He noticed the energetic fish jumping in the slanting sun in the fishing port. He went on to say:</p>
<p>"People rushed into the cellar. The women in the house were crying and trying to stop them. They also begged, but begging was useless. People pulled out many leather clothes, dazzlingly luxurious. This made us all think of our own rags, so we simply tore them into pieces. People also found thick account books. This is right, it is something smeared with the blood of fishermen, and it was also torn to pieces by the angry people. Everyone wanted revenge, wanting to smash this upstart who monopolized the fish tax to death."</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, he did not look back and continued walking forward. We were all thinking about related things.</p>
<p>I watched the clumps of white foam being swept to my feet by the small waves, and several seagulls flying in the evening breeze, beautifully calling to each other. The long embankment was like a plump T-shape, extending straight to the river surface, where there was a dense forest of masts, mixed with cooking smoke. I looked at him—my cousin's broad shoulders, the large hands carrying the basket, which were very strong. I also saw his lowered head, knowing the impact in his heart: that was probably saying: "Cousin, you still have money." Thinking of this, I felt that this contemplation was not good. So I asked about the tax donation.</p>
<p>He talked about the tax donation with a new kind of expectation. He said that new taxes were added every year, and it had already exceeded one hundred yuan. If the fish scale was established, everyone would not be able to survive. He also said that a boat cannot catch many fish; even if a good net is caught, it will go to Yingkou to pay off the debt. He also said that if the boat is not repaired, it will often have problems. Even people's lives are afraid to think about it: I listened to these, and fell into my grandmother's story, where the boat fell on its side, traveling like a flying fish, the giant wind slapping the golden stars, which was a terrifying and bleak night scene.</p>
<p>The boats on the river had all entered the port. The masts and sails were crowded together on both banks. The dense hulls of the boats were deep brown, and although old, they were full of the deep flavor of fairy tales. On the other side of the wide river mouth, a row of white sails was floating. We sat on the embankment opposite the river, waiting for the white sails and masts.</p>
<p>My cousin rolled up his trouser legs and took off his shoes. His large body and legs appeared particularly tall and long. His cheeks were thin and strong. His eyes had a super-cold calmness, watching the white sail very patiently, which was flashing sunlight towards the evening sun.</p>
<p>"Hey! Are there any big shrimps? "The loud voice reverberated in the evening air, and it took a long time to hear the echo: "No, there are no big shrimps: there are a few crabs."</p>
<p>"Look at the iron boat of the ×× devils, who specialize in buying big shrimps and also go to the river mouth to cast nets."</p>
<p>So he jumped into the mud, carrying the basket and stepping over. The boat had already dropped anchor. I saw him climbing onto the side of the boat with both hands, stirring his feet in the river a few times, and climbing up.</p>
<p>Several children were arguing loudly about buying new fish and shrimps.</p>
<p>After a while, he ran back, carrying a few crabs. The ghostly green crabs were poking each other with their carapace tips, and the long claws were climbing vigorously, spitting foam as if intoxicated when they heard the sound of the port water.</p>
<p>An hour later, I sat in the courtyard with my aunt's family and ate boiled crabs. The south wind in September brought the sea breeze, and I felt a different realm that I had not thought of and was troubled by.</p>
<p>憂鬱</p>
<h3 id="e154">Melancholy <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>By Luzhi</p>
<p>It's like I walked into a spring forest, full of bird sounds in my ears, full of colors in front of my eyes, but I am more melancholy. More melancholy, because what I hear is a melancholy sigh, what I see are melancholy and hungry eyes, when I carefully examine my surroundings.</p>
<p>How far away is spring from us? No, our hopes are not that extravagant. We want only pleasant sounds, pleasing colors. All we want is a moment of rest, even if it's just a moment, allow us to escape from the encirclement of melancholy, lie down quietly, lick the wounds given by life, and caress the bleeding wounds. But although hope is low, as low as not having hope at all, we cannot achieve this low hope either. Is it foolish? If the reason for living in melancholy is foolishness, I will curse those clever humans - squeezing blood and juice from their fellow humans, or using sweet methods to snatch what they need from their fellow humans. If these behaviors are clever, then humans should not praise the words left by those philosophers, and should not use the words and deeds of those philosophers as a label. Ah! How foolish I am, this proves that my foolishness is a fact, the reason why humans praise and label those dead people is just like using a rein to control a wild horse to control another group of people who are considered foolish, simple and honest!</p>
<p>I have traveled through several provinces and encountered tens of thousands of people. Some of them I know well, and some I met hastily. I have seen the melancholy in their hearts. For the sake of life, for a little hope, they struggle, struggle, and finally let out that inherent long sigh, and then bury their heads and go back to life. I am always encountering these people living in melancholy.</p>
<p>Why do people always have this same face? I can't believe that I was born in a melancholy country, because I once wandered to an island nation called gentle and beautiful to prove that other countries would be better than my homeland, but it was the same there. The people there, the ones I could see, also had a long, melancholy face, a long, melancholy sigh. I can't help but think, so the world is full of melancholy everywhere, and people are born to be melancholy.</p>
<p>My certainty cannot but be overturned when I hear that there is indeed a land on earth that melancholy cannot extend to, a country that once lived in long-term melancholy and finally drove out melancholy. I find proof, even if it's a fact as small as a speck of dust flying from that land. Indeed, I cannot but revise my certainty: people are not born and grow up with melancholy, but the melancholy are caused by foolishness - but this foolishness is not the foolishness of every person, but the foolishness of the melancholy people. Why do they let those wasters, extravagants, and people who plunder the joy in their hands exist!</p>
<p>I have received enlightenment, received the greatest permission, I will go to the crowd full of melancholy sighs and melancholy eyes again, and say: We should not be melancholy, our melancholy is unreasonable!</p>

<p>Women who have always been dependent on men for survival have been poisoned by the three obediences and four virtues of "obedience to father, obedience to husband, obedience to son" for thousands of years, even to this day. Women are always oppressed women. They follow this poison and are controlled by men, allowing them to be manipulated!</p>
<p>Due to the long-standing habit of women's inability to live independently, vanity has become paramount. Weak-willed women also do not think about production! Applying makeup and decoration, thinking of pleasing others, and enchanting and lewd behavior are considered tools to please people; especially urban women, have all kinds of incredible filthy behavior. - Therefore, the word "doll" has been unconsciously endured by most unaware women.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Xikang Representative Ma Zezhao's Impressions of Shanghai Education Gratitude for Educational Support for Xikang Students Hope for Nationwide Admission of Border Region Students <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Ma Zezhao, the representative of the people of Xikang stationed in Nanjing, came to Shanghai this time to arrange the admission procedures for Xikang students. He met with Chen Heqin, Huang Jingwan, Shu Xincheng, Liu Zhanen, Zheng Xigu, Shen Tilan, He Qingru, Wu Xiaoyou, and others to arrange the placement of Xikang students and led them to visit various places. The results were extremely satisfactory. After returning to Nanjing, Ma expressed his deep impressions and published his views on Shanghai education as follows:</p>
<p>(1) All undertakings in the border regions need to be developed, and the most important of these is to communicate culture and improve the people's intelligence. This has been the belief adhered to for many years. However, if Xikang students studying in the interior serve in the interior after completing their studies instead of returning to Xikang to work, then the so-called work of communicating culture and improving the people's intelligence can only be partially completed, not fully completed. The gentlemen of Shanghai's cultural and educational circles not only pay special attention to education in the border regions but also earnestly encourage the Kang students admitted this time to return to Kang to serve after completing their studies. This insightful view has truly grasped the core of the border region education issue.</p>
<p>(2) There are a total of eight Xikang students who came to Nanjing this time, and four have been admitted in Shanghai, including one admitted to Botong Middle School, two admitted to Shanghai Middle School, and one admitted to Mullen Middle School. The others, either because of their young age or because of illness, remain in Nanjing and cannot go to Shanghai for the time being. When I first met with Mr. Chen Heqin, he took the time out of his busy schedule to lead the separate negotiations, and with the consent of the other gentlemen, this matter was completely completed in a short period of time. Their enthusiasm and speed of handling affairs are admirable.</p>
<p>(3) The visits to various schools lasted a long time, and all the students were full of vitality. At the same time, we were informed by the authorities of each school about the school's history, the purpose of establishing the school, and the methods of operation, all in great detail. They also said that they will continue to strive to become not only the best middle school in our country but also the best middle school in East Asia. What a vigorous spirit this is, and how great will the achievements be in the future?</p>
<p>Currently, there are only four Xikang students receiving this kind of good education. It is my responsibility to introduce more of them in the future, and I hope that the capable educational authorities in Shanghai will admit and train more of them so that Xikang students can continue to come to Shanghai to study and return to Kang to develop education in the border regions. I also hope that educational schools and authorities across the country will adopt the Shanghai method of admitting border region students so that there is no school in the country without border region youth. This is not only the fortune of one area but the fortune of the entire nation.</p>
