<h3>房地產之評價</h3>
<p>— 端</p>
<p>自法幣推行說者謂房地產必有起色其說誠然惟尚不容期望太奢邇來如小塊地產頗有成交然大宗地產仍欠敏活熱鬧地段空曠已久之地皮固不無鱗决櫛比之新建市房然空房减價召租之招貼依然隨處可見而房租糾紛層見迭出减租運動再接再厲此類問題解决允至爲不易有以爲此不易解决者正以房地產之重新評價爲難其實市面上旣有此一種商品不至無價格可求地產所以活動不靈者固爲市面蕭條及往昔投機狂熱所致然市上終不至無地產買賣旣有交易必有價格此種價格雖因供求關係頗有上落然就大體而言要當以成本爲依據也</p>
<p>吾人由此可知建築材料價格之變遷實爲房屋評價之重要因素此不難求之於上海躉售物價指數表中之建築材料類指數查此項指數所包含之物價凡十一如杉木建松板花旗松鋸板料企口板石灰水泥磚頭玻璃生漆漆油等均在內除鋼條法西釘之屬尚需參閱金屬類指數外可云皆備然觀察共趨勢年來大有低落之象爲便於讀者參考起見將建築材料類指數彙列於後（民國十五年物價作爲百分）</p>
<p>十六年　一〇五·四　十七年　一〇三·〇　十八年　一〇八·一</p>
<p>十九年　一一八·二　二十年　一三五·四　廿一年　一二四·四</p>
<p>廿二年　一一三·一　廿三年　一〇六·九　廿四年　九九·一</p>
<p>表中以二十年之物價爲最高故指數達一三五·四自此逐年下降至去年四月中的當於民國十五年之平均物價五月後更形低落直至十一月推行法幣始見回漲然其平均數仍比十五年爲小也</p>
<p>房地產評價旣得有此項根據再加以其他設備費用可望相當完備評價問題設能依此而獲得解决則减租糾紛亦可迎刃而解矣</p>

<h3>日本通吿退出　倫敦海軍會議　今日會議日代表正式宣布　英美法意决續開四國會議</h3>
<p>倫敦　此間今日正式宣布、日本已退出倫敦海軍會議、該項宣布發表之前、海會已决定延會、至星期三下午三時再開、俾日本代表可向東京請訓云、（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據聞海軍會議日本代表團、已將共退出會議之意、通知英·美·法·意四國代表團、總委員會將於明日開會、屆時日本代表團將正式宣吿退會、幷解釋共原因、據本社訪員所知、日本實行退出海會之後、英·美·法·意四國代表團、仍將繼續進行談判云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　日代表永野·永井兩人十三日下午六時十分在英國海軍部會見艾登外相·孟賽爾海相·查德飛軍令部長·大萊其參事等、關於第一委員會議事手續、協議達二小時、其結果日政府之共通最大限案無成立希望、因此日代表團於十三日晚函致英國代表團、正式通吿日代表今後不出席會議、卽其內容、謂永野全權將於十五日下午三時出席第一委員會、說明日本政府之提案、但不要求將該案付表决、十五日之第一委員會散會以後、日本代表不出席會議、雖將由美法意英等四國繼續討論、日本不參加此討論、（十三日同盟社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　英國海軍專家今日預測日本之退出倫敦海軍會議將產生下列各影響、　日本在東亞之地位將因之愈臻鞏固、卽可加緊進行其獨覇中國之計劃、　關於在華相互利益之英日諒解運動將趨停頓、　英國將覓求美國之諒解、允將覓求關於東方及太平洋方面之諒解、據稱英國希望美國助其制裁日本之擴充計劃、　日本軍閥之專政將益趨深刻化、擁護議會政治之人民團體復將如一九三一年至一九三二年滿洲事件後之入於黑暗時代云、（十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>今日會議形勢　五國將宣言不競爭造艦</h3>
<p>倫敦　日本繼續參加海會、今仍爲一疑問、此事端賴主席如何能使第一委員會下屆會議安渡日本平等要求之難關、蓋對該問題之投票結果、終必使日本脫離會議也、日代表團之態度雖使人深信、平等要求之爭議、早遲必須應付、但昨夜會務突有出人意料之發展、蓋英日代表團會商兩小時後、宣布今日之重要會議復將展期、俾日代表得暇續請示柬京、據今日此間消息、日本如退出會議、則擬建議由五國發表共同宣言、聲明不欲作造艦競爭、俾諸國間之友好關係不受擾動、東京方面傳來消息稱、如海會因延會而引起軍備競爭、則日本擬力圖調整國際關係云、此間各報皆謂日本平等建議如付票决、必遭否决、果爾、則日本必停止參加海會、惟各報皆料其他諸國不致將日本此議遽付表决、大會必復允接受此議、續加研究、俾五國會議得安然進行質的限制問題、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據海軍會議本社訪員所知、海會總委員會明後兩日開會之後、日本代表團卽將退出會議、此層雖在理論上尚非最後之决定、但大的不致有所變更、英日兩國代表團昨日會商結果、業已證明對於日本所提海軍共同最高額一案、决無成立妥協之可能、據英國代表表示、該國對於日本要求、原準備再加討論、但英國與其他各國代表團會商之際、各該國對於日本提案、均表反對、可見妥協實屬無望云、總委員會明日開會時、其全部時間、將爲聽聆日本代表之報吿、曁其他各國代表所擬提出之答復、但預料日本代表之報吿勢必十分冗長、故各國代表之答復、大的將延至後日開會時、再行提出、據本社訪員所知日本代表之報吿、措詞尚屬溫和、此其用意、殆不欲各國以日本態度强硬爲口實、而以海軍會議失敗責任、委諸日本也、大抵海軍會議當在本星期中結束、除非發生一種奇蹟、能使日本態度突然轉變、則該國退出之舉、當無挽回之希望、蓋以該國代表團、業向東京方面、請示退出會議時所應採取之程序故也、至以其他各國代表而論、英美兩國代表曾於今晨一度會晤、並於事前分別與法意兩國代表有所接洽、結果聞已决定於日本退出會議之後、由四國代表賡續開會、屆時日本是吾遣派觀察員列席、藉以注視會務發展情形、則此際猶難諗悉、關於此層、日本代表團方而宣稱、該國態度、將以明後兩日會議時、其他各國代表所採之立塲爲斷云（十四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>東京　日政府因軍縮會議已達到實際决裂狀態、準備向中外聲明日本軍縮方針、並對國民通吿决裂後之國際情形、同時與陸軍海軍等關係機關、研究太平洋防備及共他必要問題、（十四日同盟電）</p>
<h3>英日接洽失敗　永野談此後積極擴充實力</h3>
<p>倫敦　永野永井兩全權十三日下午六時十分會見英國代表團時、提議日本擬在第一委員會詳細說明共通最大限案、並希望各國代表審議此問題、得英代表同意、因此下决第一委員會再由日代表詳說日政府之軍縮方針、各國代表開陳意見、但其意見表示反對者殆無疑問、永野全權又提議、圓滿停開會議、以免國情形之惡化、英代表亦表示同意、决定不將共通最大限案付表决、而日代表亦不出於退出會塲等過激態度、决以文書通吿議長不出席今後會議、僅派旁聽員列席而已、（十三日同盟電）</p>
<p>倫敦　永井全權代表於十三日日英私的會談以後語人如下、現在事已至此、早已不能以任何外交技術而圖挽救、本來此事正如所料、他國政府亦知吾人之决心、旣經達到此種程度、當不能如吾人所希望、此後除上下一致、以努力伸張國力外、別無辦法、我代表團始終奮鬥於會議、今能達到此境、當係有賴於國力之背景、故今後更須痛感除實力以外、毫不足賴也云云、（十三日同盟電）</p>
<h3>日代表晤法意　無術打破僵局</h3>
<p>巴黎　賴伐爾總理兼外長曾於本日延見日本大使佐籐、據一般人所知、二人曾對國際時局、允其是海軍會議之形勢、加以討論、賴氏嗣又延見美國大使斯脫洛史、有所商談、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　意大利代表比斯察十三日上午十一時訪問日本代表團、與永野全權懇談四十分鐘、比氏說明意大利政府之造艦通吿案後、探索日本政府之眞意、而謀居中斡旋、以計打破會議僵局、永野全權對其好意表示感謝之意、同時確言日政府不能變更根本方針、並請意政府贊助日本共通最大限案、（十三日同盟社電）</p>
<h3>日本海軍觀察　海軍會議十五日結束</h3>
<p>東京　日本海軍當局關於日代表團不參加會議之决定、表示如决見解、彼此主張根本的背馳時、無論舉行任何會議、非有一方面之讓步、會議難以進行、日本絕對不讓步、而英美又不容認日提案、則可解釋爲事實上之正面衝突、其形式如何、不成問題、日本不參加之四國會議、並非根基於旣存條的之會議、故四國會議係新產生之會議、與日毫無關係、無日本參加之軍縮協定、不能實行、頗爲明顯、英美亦必不爲訂立如斯無意義之條的、白費時間、故會議大抵於十五日結束亦未可知、（十四日同盟社電）</p>
<h3>日產業界動向　海軍競爭有利於工業</h3>
<p>東京　在倫敦召集之國際軍縮會議、日本方面所提之共同最大限度案、未獲承認、於是日本全權代表乃通吿退出軍縮會議、關於此事、對於日本產業界之影饗、茲綜合產業界之意見、其大要如左、軍縮會議之决裂、大致係預料之情形、早已於本年度軍事豫算編制之際、慮及萬一、業經編入、現該項會議决裂已成事實、各國雖不至卽起競爭造艦、而因此當發揮其軍擴熱、自不待言、此項影響、由國內上觀之、則受現在英美財界好轉之影響、於是日本內地產業界亦將乘勢興旺、但今後英美兩國之軍需工業、當更有發展、因之財界形勢轉佳、而日本財界亦將受共好影響也、至國內之軍需工業、如鐵工。造船·化學工業方面、亦將繼續呈其活况、因此產業界全部均可發生活躍之情形、至由對外方面觀察之、輸出貿易今後當不至遭其打擊、依然繼續去年之優勢、蓋歐洲政局之動搖、空氣愈將險惡、英法意德之國際關係、當不能遽然解决、結局日本似有相當利益可圖、且英美財界繼續好轉、故日本商品亦得多向歐美輸出、至於遠柬·近東·南洋等處、素認爲日貨價廉物美、今因日本國力之再决認識等之關係、故增加輸出亦可期待、日本商品之輸出、在過去時期、早已經過無數障碍、而達到今日之隆盛、是以今後縱令增加障碍、必可暢行無阻、不至惹起悲觀之事態、又如中國問題、日本當以其獨自之立塲、竭力推進中日關係之正常化、中國亦必由世界情勢上、糾正其認識者也、故於此種方面、吾人認爲當可期待好轉、似乎在觀察上不無可能耳云云、（十四日同盟電）</p>
<h3>意國傾向重開和議　英法均不存奢望　覺目前環境中談判極困難　國聯派調查團事使人注意</h3>
<p>倫敦　現雖有或種徵象、表示羅馬傾向考慮重開談判之建議、但巴黎與倫敦對東菲旱日和平之希望、均不抱樂觀、而覺在目前環境中作新談判、極感困難、國聯應派調查委員團至阿國之建議、殊為人注意、衆覺此事須由十三人委員會决之、闻法国欲在取切实态度之前得知美国与其他各国之主见、同时羅马负责方面均指倫敦巴黎所傳關於和平新建議之說為狂談、而向視為意政府喉舌之蓋達氏、仍在意大利日報載文、謂意大利今日仍與十月三日（意軍開始攻入阿國之日）同、握有充分之主動力、而不爲和議分心、意政府今專心一志應付東菲戰事、與歐洲所施對意制裁之抵禦、阿國戰事之暫時沉寂、非由於歐洲局勢或阿國强頑之抵抗所迫成、全由軍事家謀在最佳狀况下獲得戰事之效益所致然阿國和平、他日出現、非如制裁主義者所欲之急遽的破產淸理、而爲意國一切要求之具體的組合云、（十四日路透電）</p>

<h3>美最高院判詞　政府再度敗訴　失去農產品營業稅二萬萬金　彭海德案上訴駁回政府有利</h3>
<p>華盛頓　美國最高法院今日開庭僅十分鐘、已使政府失去農產品營業稅美金二萬萬元、尙有已收之營業稅十萬萬元、其命運尚未確定、對於彭海德棉產統制法則並未直接判决、按農產品營業稅部份、上訴人爲路易西安那州米廠八家、最高法院判决、凡在起訴期中已付稅金必須發還、至於其他已付之營業稅、則商家必須證明未會將此項稅金取償於消費者、始能要求發還、故政府已收之十萬萬元前途如何、尚難確定、彭海德棉產統制法案、法院因法律手續關係、駁回上訴人摩爾之訴案、惟一月二十日喬其亞州州政府亦有關於該法之訴案一件、故屆時尙待判决云、（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　美國最高法院今日判决關於羅總統新措施之案件兩起、一有利於政府、一不利於政府、法院維護彭海德棉產管理案、而註銷台克薩斯州麼爾氏之控案、但對於魯西亞那州米廠案、則法院宣布不利於政府之判詞、彭海德案雖與新措施有關、但係產棉諸州參議員之工作、而非政府本身之事伴、至於魯西亞那州一案、法院以爲二萬萬元手續捐、必須交還製造家、法院目前對於彭海德案合法與吾、不願表示意見、故其判詞可認爲利於政府、但喬治亞州州長所提出之另一訟案、將予最高法院以繼續裁判彭海德案之機會、彭海德氏現聲稱、渠前所主動之法案現仿有效、農部有權繼續依此辦理、以救濟棉農、今年棉產當可得保護矣云、最高法院推事之所以對於彭海德案合法與否無所表示者、蓋以爲此乃下級法院所應審判之事、不應提出於最高法院也、故此控案之註銷、尚未可認爲此案合法之判定、而業已付與棉農之手續捐、可吾由納捐者收回之、此層尚　未决之問題故政府因農整法取消而起之惶恐、今猶未减也、</p>
<p>魯西亞那州米廠案、係該州碾米廠若干家所提出、根據此非眞正捐稅之理由、呈請制止政府對於手續捐之微收、米廠訴稱、此種捐稅　係管理農產之一　方法、政府濫用徵收捐稅之　、因此　僅可用以籌集國家收入、以謀全體幸福、而非謀一部份人民之利益也、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　最高法院昨判令政府將所收手　捐二萬萬元發還魯西亞那卅米廠一節、使政府有十萬萬元之出入、查農整法曾經修正、規定如農整法果屬違法、則納捐人可向政府索還之、手捐僅爲其從尋常利益付出、而未轉移于銷費人之一部份、今農整法固被判爲違法、但此修正文尚未經法院宣布無效、故政府是吾將付還十萬萬元之鉅欵、將視法院如何裁判而定、設此修正文有效、則政府祗須發還二萬萬元耳、此外最高法院與政府間尚有一事點、厥為彭海德法案、法院昨雖已不受理台克薩斯州植棉人反對此法案之訴訟、但亦未曾表示此法案是吾合法之意見、衆信喬治亞州州長提出之訴訟、他日審理時、彭海德案必歸失敗、如政府不能另籌代替辦法、則彭海德法案之失敗、勢必使世界棉價大受影響（十四日路透電）</p>

<h3>國語科講演　怎樣閱讀（下）</h3>
<p>關明書店編譯主任夏丐尊</p>
<p>以上所說的是關於參考書的話。參考書因參考的題目隨時决定，閱讀參考書的時候，要顧到自己所參考的題目，勿使題目拋荒，還要把那部書的序文目錄留心一下，記個大略情形，預備將來的翻檢便利。</p>
<p>以下應該講的是趣味修養的書，這類的書，我在上回會經講過，種數不必多，選擇要精。一種書可以只管讀，讀到厭倦才止。這類的書也該儘量利用參考書，例如，如果你現在讀着杜甫的詩集，那末有時候你得翻翻杜甫的傳記，以及別人詩話中對於杜甫的評語等等的書，如果你正讀着王陽明的傳習錄，你得翻翻王陽明的集子，他的傳肥，以及後人關於程朱陸王的論爭的著作。把自己讀着的畫做中心，再用別的書來做幫助，這樣才能使你讀着的書更明白，更切實有味，不至犯淺陋的毛病。</p>
<p>上面所講的是三種書的閱讀方法，關於閱　兩僩字的本身，尚有幾點說說想。我方才曾把敎科書分爲兩種性質，一種屬於一般的科學的，有嚴密的系統，一種是屬於語言文字，沒有嚴密的系統。我又曾說過。屬於一般科學的該偏重在閱，屬於語言文字的，只閱不够，該偏重在讀。現在讓我再進一步來說，凡是書，都是用語言文字寫成的，照普通情形看來，一部書可以含有兩種性質，書本身有着內容，內容上有系統可尋，性質屬於一般科學。書是用語言文字寫着的，從形式上去推究，就囑於語言文字了。一部史記，從其內容說，是歷史，但也可以選出一篇來當作國文科敎材。諸君所用的算學敎科書，當然是屬於算學一類的，但就語言文字看也未始不可爲寫作上的參考模範。算學書裹的文章，樸實正確，秩序非常完整，實是學術文的好榜樣。這樣看來，任何書籍，都可有兩種說法，如果就內容說，只閱可以了，如果當作語言文字來看，那末非讀不可。</p>
<p>這决播音，敎育部托我担任的是中學國語科的講話，我把我的講話限在閱讀方面，我所講的只是一般的閱讀情形，並未曾專就國語一科講話。諸君聽了也許會說我的講不合敎育部所定的範圍條件吧。我得聲明，我不承認有許多獨立存在的所謂國語科的書籍。書籍之中，除了極少數的文法修辭等類以外，都可以不屬於國語科的，我們能說論語，孟子，莊子，左傳是國語嗎？能說紅樓夢，水滸，三國演義是國語嗎？可是如果從形式上着眼，當作語言文字來研究，那就沒有一種不是國語科的材料，不但論語，孟子，莊子，左傳是國語，紅樓夢，水滸，三國演義是國語，諸君的物理敎科書，植物敎科書也是國語，甚至於張三的賣田契，李四的家信，也是國語了，我以爲所謂國語科，就是學習語言文字的一種功課，把本來用語言文字寫着的東西，當作語言文字來研究學習，就是國語科的任務。所以我只講一般的閱讀，不把國語科特別提出。這一層要請諸位注意。</p>
<p>把任何的書，從語言文字上着眼去學習硏究，這種閱讀，可以說是屬於國語科的工作。閱讀通常可分爲兩種，一是略讀，一是精讀。略讀的目的在理解，在收得內容，精讀的目的在揣摩，在鑑賞，我以爲要研究語言文字的法則，該注重於精讀。分量不必多，要精細地讀。好比臨帖，我們臨某種帖，目的在筆意相合，寫字得它的神氣，並不在乎抄錄它的文字，假定這部帖共爲一千個字，我們與其瞎鈔一通，全體寫一兩個字，倒不如揀選十個或二十個有變化有趣味的字，每字好好地臨幾遍，來得有效。諸君讀小說，假定是茅盾的子夜，如果當作　言文字學習的話，所當注意的不該在書裏的故事，對於書裏面的人物描寫，叙事的方法，結構以及用辭造句等等該大加注意，諸君讀詩歌，假定是徐志摩的詩集，如果當作語言文字學習的話，不但該注意詩裹的大意，還該留心它的造句，用韻，音節，以及表現，着想，對仗，風格等等的方面。語言文宇上的變化技巧，其實並不十分多的。只要能留心，在小部分裹也大概可以看得出來。假定一部書有五百頁，每頁有一千個字，如果第一頁你能看得懂，那末我敢保證你是能把全書看懂的。因爲全書所有的語言文字上的法則，在第一頁一千字裹面大概已出現。舉例來說，文法上的法則，像動詞的用法，接續詞的用法，形容詞的用法，助詞的用法，以及各種句子的結合法，都已出現在第一頁了。我勸諸位能在精續上多用力。</p>
<p>爲了時間關係，我的話就將結束，我所講的話，亂雜疏漏的地方，自己覺得很多，請諸君代求敎師替我修正，關於中學國語科的閱讀，我幾年前曾發表過好些意見，所說的話和這回大有些不同，記得有兩篇文章，一篇叫做「關於國文的學習」載在開明靑年叢書中學各科學習法裹，還有一篇叫。「國文科課外應讀些甚麼」，載在中學生雜誌叢刋讀書的藝術裹，諸君如未曾看到過的，請自己去看看，或者對於我這回的講話，可以得到一些補充。我這無聊的講話，費了諸君課外的時間，對不起得很。　（完）</p>

<h3>科學叢談</h3>
<p>— 中國科學社主編</p>
<p>人造絲　高飛</p>
<p>人造絲，我們看着這個名稱，就知道它並不是由蠶身上吐出來的絲，只是由科學家用合成的方法所造出來的一種用品，雖說這個發明不過五十多年的歷史，但在現在，它已佔有世界上廣大的市塲，它已成爲人們所歡迎的主要織品之一種了，我們倘若高興到綢緞店裏用目張張，玻璃櫥裏面所陳設的，櫃檯上面所堆置的，什麽絲光紗呀，什麽巴黎綢呀……五光十色，滿眼琳瑯，這，一切的一切，不過人造絲，或人造絲和蠶絲，棉，毛等隨意組合而成的織品罷了。</p>
<p>人造絲的原料人造絲所織成的織品的種類雖是不少，但它原料却只植物纖維素一種，纖維素是一種碳水化物，是一切植物本身主要的成分，只是世上植物的種類太多了，所以植物本身所含有的纖維量的多少也因之而各各不同，植物含纖維素的量最多的首推棉花，大的含有百分之九十，其决麻類，也含百分之八十，至於稻草，竹，木材，不過百分之五十而已。</p>
<p>人造絲的發明　人造絲首先發明的是法國人沙多內伯爵Count　de　Chardonnet　在西歷一八八五年，他將纖維素溶解於硝酸中，使成爲低硝化織維素，這種東西就是火棉，可作無烟火藥之用，然後帶熱將硝化纖維素溶解於酒精和醚的混合液中成爲粘體，再加五十氣壓的壓力，使這粘體由0，08mm直徑的細孔中壓出，壓出之物，外部雖是凝成固態，內部還是保存粘體，利用這點好處，便可由此製成很細的人造絲了，只是絲中含有硝酸，容易着火，要除去這個弱點，常酒精和醚的混合液蒸發完了以後，還得用硫化錏將硝酸完全洗掉。</p>
<p>人造絲的製造的種類人造絲的原料—纖維素，在大地上，眞有取之不盡，用之不竭的好現象，但，倘要將它溶解，却也不是一件容易的事，除了用强酸或强鹼的溶液來溶解外，其餘一切溶液都是無用，因用溶液的種類不同，於是人造絲的製造的種類也分成四個了，現在將這四個摘要說明如後：</p>
<p>硝化纖維素的人造絲同人造絲的發明，從略。</p>
<p>氫氧化銅錏溶液纖維素的人造絲　第一步，先將氫氧化銅錏溶液配好，配法是將苛性曹達加入硫酸銅溶液中，便有沉澱產生，然後將此沉殿加入阿摩利亞溶液中，而得深藍色的氫氧化銅錏溶液，第二步，將纖維素先浸於苛性鈉溶液中的十分鐘，取出，用水洗滌，然後容解於已配好的氫氧化銅錏溶液中，而成爲酸化銅錏纖維素，再將這酸化銅錏纖維素溶液由細孔中壓出，而入於硫酸中，便凝固而成爲色美而有光彩的絲了。</p>
<p>黏性人造絲　將造紙用的木漿，用苛性曹達處理，再溶解於二硫化碳中便得粘性很强，帶橘黃色的溶液，這種溶液，可供照相軟片，電氣絕緣體，人造象牙，防水布等製造，至於人造絲的製法，也是將這溶液由細孔中壓入於氯化錏或硫酸中，洗去硫化物，便得堅實和具良質的絲。</p>
<p>醋酸纖維素的人造絲　將棉花或木漿加入氷醋酸，脫水醋酸，濃硫酸的混合液中，便溶解而得醋酸纖維素，醋酸纖維素，除溶解於醋酮，哥羅芳，氷醋酸等由細孔中壓入於水中製造人造絲外，此物並可製造照相軟片，電氣絕綠體和飛機翼子的塗料等用，因此物與火接觸，火僅能燃燒接觸一部，而無延及他部的優點。</p>
<p>因有上述四種不同的製法，所以，每種所製出的人造絲，也各有它的不同之點，雖說原料豐富而又值廉，但若加以原料處置的消耗，製造時間的久暫，人工的開支等等計算起來，於是因這種種的差別，人造絲織品在市面上的價值也就因之分高低了。</p>
<p>人造絲和媒焦油染料的關係媒焦油就是媒當乾餾以後所產生黑色油狀和具有不快臭氣的液體，這種液體，一百年前視爲廢物，但在現在，它已成爲工業上重要的原料了，除掉由這種液體可以提出許多不同的重要油類外，並可利用這個而合成不少不少的染料，開始發明利用這個液體合成染料的是英國人拍琴Perpin在一八五六年，他由爚硇的氧化而得到爚硇紫，洋紅甲基紫染料，由是繼起研究而發明者，風起泉湧，到了今日，市塲上所出售的萬種以上合成的染料，都是拜從前視爲廢物的煤焦油所賜了，科學的應用，是如何地去將一般世俗所視爲廢物的而使成爲大衆有用之物，這就是科學家所認爲他們重大努力的一個，由此我們更可了解科學對於人生是如何地密切和重要了，話說遠了，現在再回到本題上，染料用處怎樣？染料的用處，就是將棉麻毛絲的織品染上各種顏色，只是棉麻的本質是纖維素，毛絲的本質是蛋白質，蛋白質是容易於染色，纖維素此較難些，我們可以單獨用一種原料所織成的織品加染，我們也可以用人造絲，棉，麻，毛，絲隨意配合所織成的織品加染，所以，在未染色以前，我們若拿隨意配合的織品來看，初看起來，很是潔白勻凈，可是，等到加染以後，每一種綫，就吸着特種的染料，而複雜的組成，也就隨心所欲地一一顯明了，淡雅鮮艷，五色繽紛，使世界上由此也更多光明，更多愉快了，人造絲因染料而增加共美麗，染料因人造絲而更擴張其用途，他們眞可謂難兄難弟，相得益彰了。</p>
<p>人造絲和蠶絲在各方面的比較　自從人造絲問世以來，它的生產量的年年猛進，品質上的日臻美滿，和需要方面的日趨廣大，因之形成蠶絲唯一的勁敵，而世界上蠶絲的市市塲，也幾乎全爲人造絲所壟斷了，茲將蠶絲和人造絲的各方面比較一下，我們由此可明人造絲的前途正方興未艾，沒有限量的：</p>
<p>品質　上面已經談過，人造絲的本質是纖維素所組成的，蠶絲的本質是蛋白質所組成的，雖然本質小有差異，但因人造絲的逐漸改良，日益美滿，在應用上，人造絲已不感到如何地困難，茲將在現在人造絲的品質不及蠶絲的主要三點，舉出以資比較：一是人造絲比蠶絲的此重爲重，因之所織成的織品也重，不及蠶絲來得輕便，二是人造絲的彈性比蠶絲低下，因之織品皺後不易恢復原狀，有損美觀，三是人造絲的强力只有蠶絲的三分之一，容易吸收潮濕，此外，人造絲的光澤，染色，織度等，完全可和蠶絲並駕齊驅，至於我們隨心所欲需要任何形式—長的短的，厚的薄的，扁的圓的，光的毛的，人造絲固可完全適應，而它的一根單錢，可以紡出幾千碼長，毫無打結和斷裂的毛病，很可博得我們的讚嘆了。</p>
<p>織度　人造絲的本質不及蠶來得優良，但在織物適度方面，不獨堪與蠶絲媲美，並且還有兩點，却非蠶絲所能望其項背，人造絲有此，也很可自豪了，一是人造絲適於織厚綢，二是廣幅織物，人造絲具有特別的適用性，允其和毛，棉的交織品。</p>
<p>價格　人造絲的價格，在近幾年間，在市塲上，和蠶絲都一樣地降落，外表看來，似乎都是不好的現象，但若實際加以考察，我們只有替蠶絲可憂而無須乎代人造絲來躭心的！原來在最近二十年來，蠶絲的產額不到二倍，而人造絲的增加却有二十二倍之多，而人造絲的價格降落，只是因爲它是機械生產，藉技術的改良，應社會的需要，可以很快的减低成本而是生產的能率向上所致，蠶絲不然，蠶綫的價格降落，完全是因市塲的被奪，不得已而出此，因蠶絲本是一種農業和手工業，在生產技術上，進步比人造絲要慢得多，成本便不能隨便的减低了。</p>
<p>由上面三點看來，人造絲在現在，只品質比蠶絲爲差，但因它的織物適度和價格可以從廉看來，蠶絲也只有望洋興嘆了，至於人造絲的光澤，染色等，固可完全和蠶絲並駕齊驅，而它的品質日逐改良日臻美滿和適應於現在世界經濟恐慌，因之供給人們有絕大的需耍性看來，可知人造絲的前途，確是方興未艾，沒有限量了。</p>

<h3>康華織綢廠主　陸如康被狙擊</h3>
<p>暴徒二人當塲逃逸</p>
<p>傷在要害勢甚危殆</p>
<p>本地人陸如康、現年四十歲、家住閘北慶雲路順興里五號、向業人造絲、幷開設康華織綢廠於閘北靑雲路、不意在昨晨八時許、當陸方起身盥洗之際、突來暴徒二名、各持手槍、由後門闖進內室、一見陸如康、卽不問情由、援槍向其亂射、計發三槍、一中左肩、一中頭部、一槍未中、當時陸猝不及避、立卽痛倒地上、臥身血泊中、兩暴徒見目的已達、卽又身出門逃逸無踪、待經家人及崗警等聞聲趕到、兇手早已遠颺、乃急報該管西寶興路分所、派警四出追緝兇犯、一面將陸飛送寶隆醫院救治、以傷在要害、勢甚危殆、至於兇手何人、據云恐爲結仇而起、刻下警務機關正在密查中、</p>
<p>財政部此次改革幣制、停使硬幣、規定以中·中·交·三行鈔票爲法幣、其他有發行鈔票權之銀行、則命令於上年十一月三日止停止發行、而大陸銀行遂藉口該項法令、欲將與華豐等十三家所訂領用中南銀行鈔票、共計一百七十五萬元之契約取消、各莊均以契約並未滿期、一致反對、並延詹紀鳳律師向第一特區地方法院對大陸及其行長葉扶　提起確認</p>
<p>契約有效　並給付所交四成現金之週年利息之訴、經法院一度開庭後、大陸亦延王傳壁律師具狀辯訴、於是原吿亦復具狀、將被吿之辯訴理由、逐點論駁、詳情已備誌報端、惟本市推行名銀行鈔票、卽所謂領用暗記券之錢莊、爲數甚多、故對於是案、認爲於領券者有</p>
<p>深切利害　詎容漠視、是以昨日下午一時半、由黃大熙推事開十三法庭繼續審理時、除原吿各莊代表馬文祥·劉希孟·殷煥之·等、仍皆投案外、金融界到庭旁聽者、不下四五十人之多、旁聽席頓吿滿座、黃推事當因原吿請求判决者、爲　確認契的有效、　給付利息兩點、故向原吿律師詢問其息如何計算、詹律師卽稱、各原吿領券數額、</p>
<p>多寡不等　息金應照契的所定而依領額交存證金之數目計算、請判被吿自二十四年一月一日起至年底止如數給付、此一事實、被吿當無爭執、被吿律師王傳璧遂稱、被吿對於息金、並未計算、且被吿主張在於廢的也、庭上乃轉向被吿律師詢問日、財政部並未停止已發行</p>
<p>鈔票流通　被吿律師答曰、因財部命令、限於十一月三日止、不能再有發行、故被告主張廢的、官續詢之曰、本案爭點、不是發行問題、今試問原吿有無照的尚未領足而要求被吿繼續發行之舉、答曰、無此情形、且已不需再代推銷、問然則房售已領之券、當仍在繼續流通、被吿亦未收回、答曰、然、官旋舉通商銀行與領券者所訂契的、</p>
<p>迄仍有效　向被吿律師詰問、該律師則謂彼此情形、各有不同、故不能相提併論、於是詹律師乃提出鹽業銀行發與該行領券者付息之通知條兩頁、並聲明鹽業。大陸。同爲四行之份子、對於領券一事、步趨當屬一致、今鹽業於領券契的繼續履行、並仍照的付息、而大陸何故竟欲獨異、被吿律師隨亦以</p>
<p>業經取消　之領券契的一疊呈案、謂被吿對他家所訂之的、現多有取消者、今特提出、俾資參考、原告律師卽駁之日、此項取消之契約、內有係業經期滿、及期限將滿都、或係給予一種特別利益而始取消者、殊不能以之束縛本案、黃推事以本案尚須調查、諭令原吿詳製利息計算表呈案、改期二月五日下午再訊、並向雙方表示希望在外和平解决之意、而雙方代理律師亦各尊重法庭善意、唯唯而退、</p>

<h3>上海之調味粉業中國徵信函主編</h3>
<p>（上海工商業槪况之九）</p>
<p>一、沿革</p>
<p>調味粉爲新起化畢製品，入於人類食譜，爲時尚不久速，蓋自德國科學家利德哈孫發明於穀類中提鍊哥羅登酸鈉以後，日人池田博士始知用以製成調味粉，該粉製造方法，即先從麵粉中提鍊麵筋，以鹽酸酒精等物化合，然後再碾成粉末，而爲調味粉，日人製造之調味粉，其牌號最老者卽爲市上通銷已久之「味　素，」考「味　素」之推銷吾國，向由日商鈴木洋行經理，據業中人估計，以往輸入最多之時，平均每月竟達二十萬元，由此可見國人生活程度之日見提高，以及對於調味粉之迫切需要，故愛國之士，爲挽救該項漏巵，遂奮起自行仿造，民十一成立於上海之根泰和合粉廠，即爲其嚆矢，嗣後接踵而起者頗形踴躍，如天廚味精廠於民十二創立，天一味母廠於民十五開設，民十八至民二十之三年間，復有鴻福太乙等五廠勃然而起，極一時之盛。其後因淞滬之戰，世界經濟恐慌以及日貨捲土重來等等原因，該業遂轉趨衰落，新起者僅天元味素廠一家，而收歇者則時有所聞，如味中根泰各廠，即其中規模較大者。洎乎今日，上海方面生產範圍較大者，僅存天廚，天一，中國化學工業社調味品部，太乙，天生，天元等六家而已。</p>
<p>調味粉爲日人之發明物，前已言之，行銷於我國市場，垂一十年。惟自華廠粉起以後，國產味粉增多，日貨遂受相當排擠。迨「九一八」瀋變以後，國人會一致抵貨，日本味粉幾告絕跡，此實爲民族工業之福音。奈何近二年來，中日形勢又起激變，朝野競倡親善，致日貨又復暢銷無阻。現今市上各南貨店所經售之黃聽子及白聽子調味粉，均係輸人之日貨。該項聽子味紛，旣無招紙，又無商標，極易混銷市上，其間且有奸商，願爲改裝，冒充國貨，其勢遂更浩大，據估計目下每年輸入，平均又達百萬元左右，則其發展前途，我人實應加以注意者也。</p>
<p>二、主要華廠之現狀　本埠現存之調味粉廠，其規模較大者僅天廚等六家，前已言之，今將其近况分述於後：</p>
<p>一，天廚味精廠——該廠成立於民國十二年，初時資本僅五萬元，係富商張逸雲，與吳蘊初，王東園，等合夥設立，現有工廠三處，均在法租界菜市路及新橋路，發行所以前設在寗波路中旺弄，現已邀至愛多亞路紫來街附近，其機器如蒸汽鍋，揑粉機，滬機，離心力機等，一應俱備。該廠第一廠係下　及製造工作，的有工人一百五六十名，第二廠佔地頗廣，前係裝瓶及裝璜工作，的有工人二百餘名，第三廠係鍊白工作，的有工人百餘名，據云各廠開支每月的一萬元左右。該廠所出佛手牌味精，色白味鮮，與日貨「味　素」不相上下，前年又出古鼎副牌味宗，以便與同業競爭，每月產量共計的有二萬餘磅，其營業額初時年的數萬元，民國十五年以後，突形增加，最近每年可達二百萬元左右。獲利甚豐。去年秋間該廠有改組爲有限公司之議，至今秋改組成功，擴充資本至二百萬元，內大部均係歷年公積移撥，新招股東不多云。</p>
<p>二，天一味母廠——該廠成立於民國十五年七月，最初範圍甚小，係葉墨君，水渭臣等合夥開設，資本僅一萬元，因範圍擴充，翌年乃增添資本至五萬元，努力經營，年有進展，現已改組爲股份有限公司，資本亦增至二十萬元。該廠有製造廠二所，一在華德路，一在昆明路，發行所設於芝罘路二四三號。並設分發行所於香港莊士頓道。其應用機器，尚稱齊備，工人常有一百餘名，其出品蓮花牌味母，頗爲暢銷，前年並出副牌金星味粉，品貨亦佳。全年營業額，聞常在一百萬元上下云。</p>
<p>三，中國化學工業社調味粉部——該社範圍廣大，資本一百萬元，調味品僅屬營業之一種，定名觀音粉，並利用副產品製造醬油精。廠內澱粉機，糖化器，焦化器等等設備，皆極完備。全年營業額的四五十萬元。近又出副脾味生，以應市銷云。</p>
<p>四，太乙麥精粉廠——該廠設立於民國十八年八月，資本三萬元，係王正餘章靜初等合夥開設，原有工廠二處，第一廠在閘北海昌支路八十五號，第二廠在法租界貝勒路恒慶里五十五號。但第二廠不幸於前年八月間因鍋爐爆炸，全部焚燬（當死工人三十餘名，廠主章靜初亦殉難焉），故目下僅存一廠。該廠範圍不大，設備亦較簡單，其出品雙桃牌麥精粉，售價亦較低廉，尚能獲得一般平民歡迎。</p>

<h3>西靑籃球　海賊蟬聯錦標</h3>
<p>恊興相差四分失敗</p>
<p>結果四五比四九分</p>
<p>協興籃球隊、咋又蹈曁甫覆轍、因擲籃欠缺把　、　四十五比四十九分之差、敗於海賊、如罰　能每擲俱中、實有獲勝之可能也刻海賊以八戰八勝之成續、錦標已屬囊中物、設最後一賽、敗於東華、亦無絲毫影響矣、茲將甲組成績列决、即可窺見形勢之一斑、</p>
<p>先聲奪人比賽延至九時零五分開始、跳球之下、海賊皮塞雨得卡遜助、首開紀錄、協興沉着應戰、丘　燮擲中於先、翁仁安偷襲於後、轉瞬以叫比二後來居上、萊恩再平等之、徐亨遙投中的、周達雲罰球成功、協興又以七比六占先、嗣後翁仁安徐亨相繼增加五分、海賊竟以六比十二屈居下風、</p>
<p>海賊超出此後海賊漸見得手、史密斯兩擲兩中、萊因籃下中的、即成十二平分、史規亞犯規、張錦祥擲球過低、失却上風機會、卡遜連投帶罰、即以十五比十二轉占前導矣、</p>
<p>追隨局面嗣張錦祥遠擲得手、比數僅相差一分、海賊乃經中鋒萊因跳球優勢、史密期連中三元、史規亞隻手托入、又以二十五比十四遙領、張錦祥不甘示弱、再度中的、萊因亦照樣還敬、最後張錦祥逞能、乃成上半時二十五比十八之形勢、</p>
<p>協興居上下半時協與愈戰愈勇、周達云先造成二十比十五之紀錄、卡遜偷襲敏捷、以徐亨犯規、罰取一分、張錦祥復兩投兩中、比數又成二十四比二十六、相差僅二分、海賊再接再厲、卡遜史密斯萊因時來運來、相繼獲中四球、嗣叉成四十比三十一、周達云增加四分、張錦祥勇敢過人、追成三十九比四十二、海賊白乃特入場、巷出皮塞爾、恊興周達云四决犯規出塲、由沈崇敎替代、徐亨沈崇敎兩度投籃命中、恊與又以四十三比四十二、超出一分</p>
<p>勝利關鍵惜入後不能持久、海賊大施活躍、卡遜·史密斯·白乃特相繼射中、又成四十八比四十三、協興丘廣燮於人叢中躍起投入、成四十五比四十八、最後卡遜罰球中的、乃成四十九比四十五之精采、協興以四分受挫、</p>
<p>球藝槪評協興全隊表演、實不在海賊之下、張錦祥翁仁安等能攻能守、確爲不可多得人材、惜全隊擲球不準、而受敗挫、然以始終不懈之奮鬥論、雖敗猶榮、海賊萊因身長體高、占盡便宜、卡遜智勇兼全、罰球九决均告命中、乃海賊唯一功臣也、</p>

<p>這一星期裏旣然出了這麼不幸的亂子，大家疑神疑鬼，好不煩悶，因此日子覺得特別長，到了星期日，孩子們見到唐恩有些異樣都相互問道「唐恩幹嗎」？往常他是忽喜忽怒，可是那天他偏很沉默，無論何人不能刺探出他的心事。他們散步的時候，他離開大衆獨自一人行去，回來也較別人爲遲。他於黃昏叙談時也不參加，獨自己坐在陰影裹，忙着自思想，大有充耳無聞的模樣。後來蜀夫人取出那本修養簿來，給他看一次特別美好的成績報告，他雖然一看，郤毫沒一些笑容，只說道：</p>
<p>「想我還能過去，不是嗎？」</p>
<p>「很好很好，唐恩！我很快樂，因爲我常常在想你只需要一點的帮助，使你成就一個很好的孩子。講題　農村衰落的原因講師　鄒樹文時間　下午六時半至七時週率　六六○（中央廣播電台）</p>

<p>金雞愈穩</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、市極平庸、交易依然缺乏、總結賬時期迫近、大家忙於結束、對於營業範圍縮小、市豪絕無精彩、但本月份某公司中棉公司均要收貨、市價轉昂、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲一·二·五角、午後開盤微見下降、拍至二盤以後、大阪三品紗回昇、本月份有某國紗二十支二百五十包、檢查顏色斤兩皆不合格退下、人心轉堅、市價疲中帶硬、結果各月比上日收盤價漲一·二角、查賣出大孚四百包、大豐一千一百包、賡豐四百五十包、　昌三百五十包、生源一千九百包、明華四百包、長豐四百五十包、大昶四百包、晋康九百五十包、買進裕大三百九十包、達記五百包、明德八百五十包、恒德叫百包、愼記五百包、元一一千一百包、益昶六百包、長豐四百五十包、價誠六百五十包、恒昌六百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>粉交十八日起休假十天</p>
<p>昨粉市又呈疲弱、上午開盤後、以洋麥報價、芝加哥近小三角、遠小四分、坎拿大好四八分不等、市場人心、因收束已近、一部分獲利多頭、均紛紛了結、故開價雖尚平穩、以後則步步低落、不過交易又轉淸淡、毫無生氣耳、迨至下午開盤、因交易更寂、買方回出較稀、近期各月份、大致盤旋、惟六月份新粉、因有客戶套售、勢極平淡、至停市日期、定一月十八日起至一月二十七日止、至二十八日照常開拍、已公布市場、</p>
<h3>少數多頭回出期麥</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面、一致平疲、以結賬日近、各方買賣、全趨停頓、少數多頭、以結賬之故、略有回出、市氣遂平、迨至下午開盤、近遠各月份、更因粉市轉疲、形勢又虛、開價又落一二分、較之前日、計本月份跌七分、遠期小三五分、不過籌碼甚少、脚地仍見老硬、終須結賬之後、方有生色可言耳、現麥因廠胃不動、停頓未開、</p>

<h3>客秈市面須待紅盤</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、到頭續有長江與浙省各屬裝到、而去路則客團久滯本街亦以年底結束、不願多辦、因此市面平軟無神、惟貨主大多仍守至紅盤再售、市價乃無鉅大之降落、紐之目下大結束已近、各方多主收束、與旺之市面須待諸紅盤、昨日開出贛米九百廿二包、前米一百五十包、溫台米三百廿包、均由本街辦云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　節後絲市什九看漲</h3>

<p>桂圓肉前以來貨見增、適值銷路反呆故較最高價曾跌去十餘元、但本屆出數終屬不多、經此一跌、來源遂稀、而近日去胃略見活動、行方復有進意、因此價又回振、比前漲六七元之譜、預測春盤仍看績升、</p>
<h3>龍口粉貨到驟增</h3>
<p>龍口綫粉干、上週因申市軋缺、行盤會暴漲至三十一二元、爲廢兩改元後之最高價、乃前日來源已有續到、共計有千餘包、因此市便驟跌、兼之現在去胃漸淡、愈難穩定、昨市行盤叫售二十六七元、比跌五六元、尚防續鬆、蓋貨底旣增、當然回跌、</p>

<h3>徽州的新年</h3>
<p>— （方正）</p>
<p>我　　州，新年有種風俗，叫做『出行』晨，一家大小，一個一個的排列着出去，由長者領隊，並且各人還拿着油紙糊的燈籠，慢步外出，約行了幾十步，則停下點香膜拜，由長至小，拜畢則燃高升，小爆竹，所謂『連升三發』是也。道風俗很普通，幾乎故鄕每家人家都有這種把戲。還有一種叫做『開筆』，這似乎比較文雅因此只限於讀書和做生意的人家才有。所謂開筆，便是『元旦開筆，萬事大吉』，或是：『元旦試筆，諸事如意』等吉利文句。行畢貼在寫字桌旁，或張之客堂裏。還有一種風俗，叫做『送元實』，乃是於元旦第二天，鄉大總是至親眷或朋友家去拜年，大家互相『送元實』，但並不是眞的元實，而是麵粉製成的大餅；是南貨店所製，式樣猶如上海之饅頭，空心，上面即有『福　雙全』『一本萬利』等字樣，鄉人送時輒云：『送你一雙元實，吃了賺元實。『以取財源之義。鄉人之迷信，於此可見。</p>
<h3>七家茶和百家鎖</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>『七家茶』和『百家鎖』，在我的故鄉，——蘇州，是非常盛行的迷信習俗之一。</p>
<p>七家茶據說可醫治一切腸胃病的。例如胸膈不舒，食積不化等症，只須把七家茶冲着一喝，便可霍然。所謂七家茶，是從對門隔壁七家不同姓的鄭家，各乞取一撮茶葉，便成了。喝這種七家茶的，大率都是貧苦的人，有了病，無力延醫，而更其是這種輕微的疾病，當然無間錢服藥，於是便乞取七家茶，以資救濟。作者没有喝過七家茶，所以也不知七家茶，是否有效。茶葉的是否能治病，也不得而知。總之，鄰近的七家，所能的茶葉，說不定的還是從一個茶鋪子裏購來的，或許還是從同一株茶樹上採下來的也難說。所以我勸迷信七家茶的人們，以後還是省事些，把自己茶葉罐子裏茶葉，冲着喝罷。</p>
<p>百家鎖，是富貧人家，生了孩子，生怕多病多痛，於是備了一百個紅紙套，見到了親戚朋友，求給一個銅子。待到一百個紅紙套裏，每個盛着一個銅子時，於是倒出來，向銀樓中打一金鎖片。雖然一個金鎖片，至少總也得十來塊錢，但那乞討得來的一百個子兒，却總得全數交給銀樓裏作價。據說，掛着這個百家鎖，便能長命百歲。每次我回鄉時，總有人來向我乞討的。某一次，我對向我討一個子兒的某太太說：『我聽人說，掛百家鎖，是很危險的，因爲這被討的一百家中的小孩子，若有不測時，掛百家鎖的小孩子，也有關係的呢。』那位太太聽我一說，花容失色，便停止進行了。</p>
<p>這一種滑稽的打倒百家鎖方法，在實際上，還是用迷信以抵制迷信，不足爲訓的，但是在這敎育尙未普及，民智尙未極度發達之時，我覺得你若在實際上，舍不得一個子兒的破鈔，在表面上，要掛起破除迷信的幌子時，這種滑稽宣傳，倒也大可一用。</p>
<h3>英國的新年</h3>
<p>— 萸譯</p>
<p>英國人對於除舊迎新有幾種類似迷信的風俗。住在　維特地方　北的人對於大除夕，看得比新年更重。住在蘇格蘭地方的人到了大除夕，一定要舉行『歲暮節』的家宴。開宴的時間最好是已經交進元旦，至早也要打過了夜半之鐘，纔能開懷暢飲。這種風俗的起源，大槪是要表示快樂地渡過舊年而安逸地交進新年。僑居海外各地的蘇格蘭人，依舊保存這種風俗。</p>
<p>舉行歲暮節家宴的時候，點着的火突然熄滅，那是非常不祥的預兆。假使在宴會時有隣人來借火，那麽主人無論如何不肯給他的；否則一年的好運道都白白地送給他了。有幾處地方的人，對於大除夕吃年夜飯的時候，吃着最後一瓶酒倒出來恰巧輸到最後一杯酒的人，認爲運氣非凡叫做『幸運的一杯酒』，但是要偶然碰巧，不能預先做就的。假使這幸運的一杯酒被一個未婚的人吃着，那麽預言喜星高照了他或伊，在來年要結婚了。</p>
<p>元旦的莳晨囊中空無所有，那麽他要過着一年的窮苦生活。兩手空空的人不能在元旦日走進别人的家裏去。第一個到的賀年客人叫做新年的初客First　Foot，英國人對此看得很重。假使第一個走進門槛的是一個婦人，那麽一年的運道不好已是確定的了。在區洛帕夏地方認爲幸運的客人，是一頭黑髮的人做新年的初客，最最不祥的是紅頭髮的人來做新年的初客。有幾處地方的人家，備着一杯酒和一塊蛋糕，奉敬給新年的初客吃。</p>
<p>在蘇賽克斯地方，青年男女三三兩兩結成團體，到各村人家去做新年的初客。做着第一個的人；可得一枚銀幣，一塊切碎的蛋糕，和一杯加糖與香料而熱的接骨木漿果酒。做着第二個的人可得銅幣。這裏還有一種風俗，就是在元旦日决不能從家裏拿一些些的東西，帶進家裏來的東西却儘多不妨。即是極小極賤的東西，如茶葉，馬鈴　的皮和煤灰等，也　當心地保留一夜，到明天早晨讒能拿出門去。這樣可以保證一年中的收入超過了付出。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十三回　繞室發高談奮將起訴　傾壼聯舊好利可忘嫌</p>
<p>他就很不在乎的樣子，微笑答道：一個人告我，我是被告。一羣人告我，我也不過是個被告。反過來，我是一個人，大家認爲是很嚴重的婦女問題，告一羣人，也無是一個婦女問題。我就這樣想破了，還怕什麽，他說得高興起來了，不顧一切，只管把那番牢骚之意，陸績的發表。那訪員看他是毫無忌憚的說着，當然是??公開的，於是也就把他最要緊的幾句話，都在日記本子上作了一個記號，暗記下來。賈多才分明是看到了，却向他笑道：兄弟這不過私人說閑話，把閣下當一個朋友，才這樣隨便的說。我想你先生心裏頭很明白的，總不至於把我這些話，到報上去發表的。那訪員笑道：我看這也没有没有什關係。反正賈先生是預備和他們起訴的，還怕得罪他們不成？而且賈先生是位有身分的人，說話决不至於不兌現的吧？說着，把日記本子一夾，收到衣袋裏去了。隨着，也就站起身來，要告辭了。這倒苦壞了賈多才，攔若不便，放任着在勢又有所不可，於是笑着搶到房門面前去，笑道：我還有很多的話，要和你先生談話，當新聞記者的人，對於新聞材料，雖然是多多益善，可是對於被訪問的人，却也要知道一個擒縱有術　。那訪員就笑道：賈先生還有話告訴我，我是十分歡迎的。不過兄弟的工作時間，已經到了，來不及寫了，我想，賈先生允許我把所有的談話，都到報上去發表，那我們就十分感激了。他口裏說說着，人已經側了身子擠出門去，手扶了帽　，笑着點頭道：再會再會。等不及賈多才再說什麽，他已經走得很遠了，賈多才在房門口站着呆想了一想，剛才是自己太興奮了，給了那新聞記者，許多材料，明天發表出來，這些女太太們，必定有很大的反威。這小西天是他們的大本營，也許明天他們又跟着今日的樣，再　一塲。（八九二）</p>
<h3>日本貴邊山麓的戀愛决鬬</h3>
<p>— 沿</p>
<p>貴邊山是日本惟·多松柏的山嶺，附近人民，也有好幾千家。他們的職業，大槪可以分爲四種：一種是農業，除種五穀桑樹以外，兼植各種水菓，並且還經營着很簡單的陶藝事業；一種是漁業，在山的附近，有不少天然河流，供給他們捕魚，但最近大都自己掘池養魚，　成罐頭食品，運鋪都市；一種是手工業，就是雕刻各種貝殼，成爲很簡單而粗糙的美術品；還有一種是商業，把資邊山各村落的出品，運銷各地，同時把山民所需要的東西，搬運進來。這四種職業中，要算經營商業的，最爲省力了，操手工業的人，生活也好，他們大都住在貴邊山麓。</p>
<p>貴邊山麓的各種房屋，因爲有松柏參雜其間，所以另有一種好風景，每家門戶前，往往掛着一件蚌殼的雕刻品，紅絲線綠絲帶，和這美術品隨風招展，非常好看。况且有許多人家，在絲線或絲帶上，縛着一隻小鈴，鈴又作聲，就格外有雜沓，互相唱起歌曲來，和鈴聲相和合，往往終日不倦。每逢節日，尤其是新年，大家都穿了新衣服，手裏拿了許多芙術品，或是抛　當作球戲，或是擊身作爲装飾，好像尙未脫離野蠻時代般的，在松柏樹蔭下，作種種跳舞。在他們跳舞的时候，總是把貝殼類的雕刻品爲伴舞物，跳舞的姿勢，非常奇怪，『跳多舞少』四個字，實在可以形容他們姿势的大部份呢。</p>
<p>他們的跳舞，雖然是男女雜沓，但也有一個極嚴格的界限。這種界限，和其他日本内地，有所不同，就是未婚的男女，除和父母親以外，絶對不能互相跳舞。因此凡是在跳舞的年靑男女，必定是已經結婚的夫婦，否則一經查出，做父母的，就以爲是最大的恥辱，往往把子女寄養到寺院或尼庵裏去，同時他們自己也永不願互相再跳舞，免提起他們的心事。據說在從前這山麓的某一村落裏，有一富翁，他的未嫁女兒，竟和一個不相識的未婚男子，私相跳舞，後來被富翁知道了，竞把他女兒毒死，他自己也削髮爲僧，對世界的一切，都抱着悲觀。這種風俗，却極奇怪。同時還有一種戀愛决鬥的奇俗，在日本各地所没有的，而在山麓，據脱還　在着咧。</p>
<p>戀愛决鬬，每年於一月十五日，七月十五日，和十月十五日三天，在村長監視下舉行的。舉行的原因，往往有兩三個男子，戀上了一個女子，結果使女子的家長，不易取舍，或者女子所喜歡的郎君，家長不允許，或者家長所喜歡的女壻，女子不願嫁，經過一次戀愛决鬬後，由村長判斷究竟誰能當選爲女子的丈夫，那末男女各方，誰都表示服從了。</p>
<p>戀愛决鬬的地方，就在山麓下一個大曠塲裏，决鬬的那天，全村的人，都空巷來觀。决鬬的男子，頭上都戴了黑帽，手裏拿了貝類武器，互相應戰，經過十五分鐘的交戰後，就由村長斷定誰勝誰負。戰勝的男子，就由許多親戚，把他抬起，大聲高呼勝利，一方面失敗者，就垂頭喪氣，和了他的親戚回家，親戚們都默不作聲。</p>
<p>在那决鬬的早晨，爲决鬬對象的女子，却化妝得非常美麗，因爲那天無異是伊訂婚的日子，不過伊不出門外，等在家裏，一等到决鬬終了後，才和着父母親出外跳舞，表示慶祝之意，但在正式結婚以前，總不得和决鬬勝利者跳舞啊。</p>
<h3>天葬與燒屍</h3>
<p>— 鷺華</p>
<p>天葬是西藏地方至今存在的一種風俗。這就是等到一個人死了之後，不論男女老的肉一塊一塊都割了下來，然後再把它的骨頭用大鐵錐敲得粉碎，以供鳥獸的飽餐，名之曰天葬。這種字割的方法，和擎鳥攢攫爭食的怪現象，去年黃??松專使到西藏去的時候，曾由他帶去的攝影隊實地拍取過一段新聞片。這段新聞片已在月明影片公司放映過一次。筆者也是在座參觀之一。看了這凌遲還要加以碎骨的屠刑，得使人感到一種異樣的不忍！但在西藏人的意思，以爲非此不足以消死者生前的罪孽，而且以爲必定要把它的屍體全部給鳥獸吃光了，它的靈魂才好升天。</p>
<p>因爲說西藏的天葬，我又聯帶想起了西南蠻族中沿習的一種燒屍的怪俗。燒屍是在雲南省河縣西北邊境，有一部蠻人的喪葬之法。他們家裏死了人，當時照例不得舉哀，並且也不用棺殮的。只用一根穿心的槓子，把屍身扛抬到荒郊野外，堆起枯樹乾來把它焚化了。這就叫燒屍。直要等到這屍骨燒成了枯炭，大家才放聲大哭，以示悲哀之意。不過在焚燒的時候，在場的人們都要揚手跳躍，狂呼亂喊；同時還要拿了木梆竹筒，或銅鐵響器拼命的敲擊，擂鼓喧嘩，閙得天翻地覆。據說：他們所以要這樣的吵閙，是要把天空的飛鳥嚇開，免得它們下來搶食死者的肉。因爲他們相信，死者的肉如被鳥哭啄食之後，它的靈魂就不能升天了。</p>
<h3>巴答人的婚俗</h3>
<p>— 綠蕪</p>
<p>南洋荷屬蘇門答臘，有一種土人名巴答，batak他們因爲地理上的關係，生理上發育得很早；男女孩子，在十三歲的時候，就到了結婚的年齡。女的還可以遲一兩嵗，没有什麽要緊；男的，到了十三嵗，就非結婚不可了。在那面的華僑子女，到了十七八嵗，還没有結婚的，他們引爲一件很希奇的事情。</p>
<p>巴答人的住屋，分上下兩層，樓上住人，下面養猪，牛等家畜。可是，一個男孩子到了十三嵗的時候，他的家人們就不准他再到樓上來住；要和猪，牛等一同睡覺，等到找着了配偶之後，才允許到樓上來住。</p>
<p>巴答人的知識很幼稚，没有什麽禮敎觀念，男女之間的關係，是很隨便的，祗要女人允許，性交也没有什麽問題。結了婚的女人，藍色的帽子上，再加一道白邊，没有結過婚，祗戴藍色的帽子。無論那一個巴答男子可以隨便和一個女子調情，可是結過婚的女人，不大願意。和一個没結婚的女子調情，伊們是很開心的，無論要求什麽都可以。一個巴答男子見一個不相識的女人以後，可以問『我可以同你一塊去玩麽？』或『我們一塊吃飯好麽？』假使這個女人答應你這個要求以後，你可以和伊到樹林裏去隨所欲爲了。</p>
<p>巴答人是多妻主義，一個男人，可以隨便娶幾個老婆。因爲巴答女子很會做生産工作，吃苦，並且積下很多的財産，去供給伊的丈夫去揮霍，現在巴答族的酋長，就有三十幾個老。</p>
<p>巴答人還有一種奇怪的事情，就是父子很難分别，因爲巴答人的父親死了以後，兒子有娶母親或父親的妾做老婆的繼承義務。假使一個女人懷了胎以後，丈夫死去了，這個孩子生出了以後，就算是繼承的兒子，其實是他的弟弟，可是巴答人想不到有這麽一回事。</p>

<h3>捉拿竊書賊</h3>
<p>— 家爲</p>
<p>偶然跑到一個「非會員寓客或沒有値價每年一元的閱覽證不得入內」的半公工開圖書館里、看見一張「捉使竊書賊」的佈吿。</p>
<p>據佈吿上說：近有「不顧道德的人」將那里一本英文「現代史科」雜誌的一部份自行撕走了：接着又有「同類的」人將里面書架上「任人閱覽」的英文「亞細亞」與「中學生」等雜誌都帶跑了、所以要請後來讀者注意，並共同恊助拿此「靈賊」。</p>
<p>眞該死，我們這個老大的社會，竟在不斷地加工製造着這些「敗類」：前則有大學生作偸兒，詐人財，做強盜……等「艇而走險」的勾當，今則有「讀書人」在公共塲所帶走一二本雜誌作「順手牽羊」的小竊；什麽「禮義廉恥」，竟被「喪失殆盡」。眞是「世風日下，人心不古」—我們的道學先生們將要這樣「感慨系之」了！</p>
<p>記得以前讀魯迅先生的「孔乙己」—是個慣於偸書聞名的人，曾說過：「竊書不算是賊……竊書……讀書人的事，能算是偸嗎？……」</p>
<p>這不過是「孔乙己」先生的強辯吧？然他却還說着「君子固竊」，「何者」等「衛道」的濫調吧。</p>
<p>在這里，我們果不預備把這些圖書錧里「順手牽頭」的「竊書賊」，來與竊書聞名的「孔乙己」先生對比。但由此，我們却更可以認識了我們這社會的一面：一般竊「讀書人」生活的潦倒，是到了怎樣的程度；而一般靑年「智識份子」的出路，是成了個怎樣嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>不過，誰都不能否認的吧，在今日，在整個社會經濟崩潰，而遍地鬧着農村破產，都市不振，市塲凋疲，百樂蕭條等種種「不景氣」的狀態之下，跟隨着一般勞苦者羣的被少數特殊者羣棄驅到飢寒死亡綫上傾軋，掙扎，我們社會的中間階層—小有產者，也就必然地，不斷地潦倒，沒落…而我們的「讀書人」，「智識份子」也就跟着成了問題！</p>
<p>所以，或許我們可以相信：上面所講的那位撕走了一部雜誌與帶走了整本雜誌的「竊書賊」，也正有着「孔乙己」被人譏笑了「強辯」時的意思：「竊書不算是賊；竊書，讀書人的事……」。不過，我們也可相信，或者這幾位「蟊賊」是不會像「孔乙己」賊公那樣「竊」了一二本價値幾毛錢的雜誌，要去變賣了來吃老酒的吧？但事情也似乎差不多，想那人頭攢動撕「竊」了一部份英雜誌的「讀書人」，是預備去翻譯了才賣錢解决肚子的吧？</p>
<p>末了，我們要聲明一聲的，我們不是來這里預備代這幾位「竊書賊」辯護或包庇。像這些「不顧道德」，與「禮義廉恥」的「蟊賊」，「敗類」，我們是應當「共同注意，恊助捉拿」的。不過，事情却得弄淸的，是：這是否僅僅屬於「偸」的問題！</p>
<h3>海鷗</h3>
<p>— 勞心</p>
<p>—海航的故事—</p>
<p>貨船劃出了獅子寳，大家便可以偸一點兒空了。</p>
<p>三老爹用屁股坐着了舵柄，便慢條斯理地替那尺來長的烟稈，裝上了一斗老農夫牌的烟絲，邊劃上一根自來火，邊用那大姆指壓實了烟斗上的烟絲。一會兒，火凑近了烟絲，便呼咧呼咧地吸了起來。當口裏一口濃密密的烟霧噴過了後，便來嚕囌我們：</p>
<p>「掛帆咧，忘記了嗎？中屁用，你們這班光雅里貨！」</p>
<p>我們給駭得站了起來，沒頭沒腦地撐起了檣。老桂手急眼愉搶着張開了帆，我和老七　一個忙，便先豎直了檣，把帆掛了上去，慢慢地撑開了。我們沒有作聲，在工作的時候也沒有往常時一樣地喲哎喲地唱起歌來。三老爹的脾氣，我們是摸慣了的，你不去頂撞他而且順利地聽他的話去工作的時候，是可以少聽許多嚕哩嚕囌的閒話的。</p>
<p>這一會兒，有了一個機會給我們閒扯了。</p>
<p>我們坐在船頭的貨面上。我們三個，連五叔也從舵尾走了上來，掉下了三老爹一個人孤獨地吸他的烟——</p>
<p>「老舉養的，過年也要做，眞要做到年三十晚嗎？」</p>
<p>老七這脾氣頂壞的傢伙，什麽事放到他的肚子里也是變了炸藥地爆炸的。他愛埋怨他自己，他又從來沒有眞正地象他自己講的那末地去做過。這，五叔是常常嘲諷着他的。</p>
<p>「老七，又發媽×的脾氣！誰呌你做，你又不回去自家兒享福——又不呌你的老子番生來供奉你嗎？」</p>
<p>「老子，開口老子，閉口老子，你是臭老舉養的。」</p>
<p>「眞是生番，不講理，人又不是跟你吵架！」</p>
<p>「誰跟你吵架，要打，打到海龍王里去！」</p>
<p>兩隻蟋蟀碰在一起的時候，常常便會打了起來的。我們都很埋怨他們兩個，連這空閒的時候，也吵呀鬧地混着過去，有媽的興趣。老桂斜躺着，眼睛半瞇起來，帶點不耐煩：</p>
<p>「死牛！要打要鬧又不到水里去！人家正愁不得安安樂樂地過去這得閒的時候，你們却死愁有力沒處出的樣子。」</p>
<p>眞咧，一出了獅子寳的寳口，我們便可以想到有一個很好的時候可以過了。這里沒有風，也沒有浪。下水船剛巧給點順風順水帶着走，用不到費半點兒力。</p>
<p>水面很平靜。遠處還不時有一兩條跳魚，忽地跳了起來，把水湧開了一個小洞，水花戳得很高。跟着，一個小的水圈兒，追着一個大的水圈兒，一圈一圈地越追越大，越追越遠。到末了給太陽洗了一個澡，反照着絲微的波紋，便慢慢地隱沒了。</p>
<p>老桂嘆了一口氣，我看他凝視着那三四隻海鷗的飛翔，心里象掛上了什麽心事似地不安樂。走近了他，我輕輕地拍了他一下：</p>
<p>「老桂，海鷗有什麽好看？」</p>
<p>他跳了起來，象給人發現了什麽秘密似的抬了一下頭，望了我一望之後又低了下去。</p>
<p>「娘賣×的！海鷗自由哇，我們過年也要做，連海鷗也比不上。我老七不是脾氣壞，只要有一條是生路，野仔再跑上　　！」</p>
<p>斜　里又挿過來老七的牢騷，老桂冷笑了一聲。五叔說：</p>
<p>「你又怎麽？海鷗自由？他又不是為了吃？過年要做便算苦？眞不知足的人，沒得吃時我看你……」　　「祖宗十八代的，你偏要和我作對，我前世又不是欠了你的錢！」</p>
<p>「吵什麽？」老桂帶點澀苦地說：「罵來罵去都是自己人，有屁用！」老桂還沒有說完，很凄厲地嗤的一聲響着，跟着我們却看見一雙敗了毛的海鷗跌在水上。起頭他還在水上猛力地拘着他的翼，到了掙不過的時候，却那樣無力地浸在水上了。在他的身體旁面集滿了魚，而且還時不時又有別二雙海鷗飛了下來，在他的身上啄去一塊肉，又飛着回去。</p>
<p>我們嘆了一口氣，低着頭。老桂却反站了起來，把他的胳膊操練着，到未還是頹然地跌在貨面上。</p>
<h3>冬陰</h3>
<p>— 莊瑞源</p>
<p>冬是秋日的懷戀與春天的期待的季節。</p>
<p>沒有陽光，沒有落雨和降雪，而冰摧殘了草木的生機，凝結在屋頂，在枝頭，在溝裏，沾在沒有鳥兒的巢上，鋪在沒有行人的路上，冬天裏常有這種日子的。</p>
<p>在這些日子裏，我沒有歡樂，沒有哀愁，情緒是屬於冬陰的，淡白得比冬天的大淸早；便是披着一身陽光，淋着一身雨雪，而我却只有淡然的烟霧的感覺。而且喜歡咀嚼着秋日的殘薄的夢，和春天的瑰麗的憧憬。</p>
<p>於是，冬陰的日子裏，是容易感受寂寞的哩！</p>
<p>室子裏的寂寞比房屋外的寒冷是更其怕人的吧，而且比街頭的憂鬱和郊野的凜冽亦然。</p>
<p>早晨，冬天淒戾地立在我的窗前，於是窗檻窗紗窗簾之間有着大海的澎湃了。玻璃片上　着的冰花，　溜下掛着的冰柱，對於我只是添加着奇異的奇異吧了。我是愛在那擋住北風的牆根下憇息的，因為在十二月的陽光底下棕金，色的舊袍子，鮑和着灰塵的舊帽和翻開着的書本，這意味是適宜於寂寞的調劑的。</p>
<p>我也喜歡街頭的躑躅，從冷靜到熱鬧，雙從熱鬧到冷靜，聽着喧噪的市聲，而且看着自己的脚步。（雖則是在寒冷的冬之街上，我也是有着懶散的步伐的。）於是，在窳屋堆裏走着的，是我；在橋頭看着賣烤山芋的婦人的，是我；在曠塲上尋找着孩子們的陀螺的痕跡的，是我。而又時常自語地說着：要是在冰冷的室子裏，過着淡白無味的日子，那是多麽難挨的呵。</p>
<p>而且走在郊野外也是樂事。在衣領裏縮起脖子，在衣袋裏袖起兩隻手，半閉着眼皮抵擋野大的尖風，冬天是有着更可笑的面貌的。秋日的蕪草經不起一夜的狂風，冰霜，彎倒在地上躺着；冬天的樹木却有着無葉的枝枒有力地直挿在低壓的天幕底下，會叫我想起雁來的方向，和加倍地暗笑粗獷的冬陰的</p>
<p>但這些都是隨便的愛好，對於冬我沒有偏憎也沒偏戀，只是在淡白的情緒裏，我溫着殘薄的夢和瑰麗的憧憬。</p>
<p>冬陰的日子裏，我是憎惡孤寂比於嚴寒的人。</p>
<h3>藍大褂子</h3>
<p>— 華穆</p>
<p>操塲里，楊老師的銀哨子響過了。一羣小山羊般的小學生，跑跑跳跳的走攏來。好容易排成一個方豆腐塊的隊形。站在前面的楊老師再吹了一下哨子，一羣小山羊的小眼睛都向老師這邊望過來。</p>
<p>「聽到，現在準備進城去參觀展覽会。我昨天已經對你們說過，那一個沒穿藍大褂子的就留在學校里。大家自己看看自己，凡是沒穿藍大褂子的就自動退出去。」</p>
<p>楊老師的話剛煞住，小山羊羣里卽飛起一陣嗡嗡之聲，黑黑的小腦袋不住探前翻後，隊伍凌亂了；幾個雜色軍就悄悄從中央退到塲子一角去，小眼睛受了委屈似的望着留在塲子里的同學們。小毛阿三歡喜得直跳，翻過去推了一下後排的馬大成。</p>
<p>「你沒藍大褂子的！」馬大成狠狠的瞪了小毛一眼，沒理她。</p>
<p>楊老師的哨子又響了，面上顯然沒有剛才自然。</p>
<p>「聽到！我不是常常對你們說過嗎。一個好學生是應該聽話，守秩序的。馬大成—你為什麽不退下去？」</p>
<p>前頭的黑黑的小腦袋又一齊翻過來。馬大成的小臉孔隨卽紅紅的像塗了一</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>層胭脂。但他很鎮定的說了。</p>
<p>「我也要去。」口氣顯得很固執很脆利。場子裡頓然肅靜起來。楊老師的面上顯出更不自然的顏色，心里想，這個孩子太頑皮了，於是說：</p>
<p>「你也要去？那你為什麼不穿起藍大褂子來？」</p>
<p>「我媽說，烏大褂子也一樣的，我又沒有做藍大褂子。」場子里嚇的一聲笑起來。</p>
<p>「你曉得沒有就是了，誰呌你媽不給你做？像你這個樣子，一件大褂子也穿得不三不四，外面不比學校里，要給人笑話的，你曉得嗎！快，快給我退下去！」楊老師從前頭走過來，一手把馬大成扯著往外邊推，馬大成一下子哭了：</p>
<p>「我媽說的，烏大褂子也一樣的，我又沒有做藍大褂子的，呦呦……」</p>
<p>場子裡的小山羊覺得好看極了，又噗的一聲笑了。</p>
<p>楊老師沒事般地走回前頭，又把哨子吹了一下，口里喊：</p>
<p>「立—正，原體向左轉。開步走！」</p>
<p>操場里靜靜寂寂留下一陣黃塵……</p>

<p>七年後，這一對夫妻，因為身體不大健康的關係，到乍浦的海濱去休養，德馨對於海濱的貝殼，感到非常的興趣，在海灘上認識了一個比自己大一歲的孩子，由於這孩子的母親的訴說，胡蝶知道這孩子便是她和高占非所生的祥麟，但她不敢承認是自己的孩子，只好暗地裏對祥麟加以撫愛。德馨與祥麟實在太要好了，他倆每天到潮水退了的海難上去拾貝殼。一天，德馨不知道利害，竟一個人跑去，恰巧又是潮將漲的時候，等到祥麟趕來發現了道危險，潮水已佈滿了海灘，他明白叫人去救他已經是來不及，便奮勇地跳下了水，負著德馨在潮水裏掙扎着，但是氣力究竟不濟，等到別人將他倆救起來的時候，已經是呼吸停止了。胡蝶伏在他們的身上，哭得死去活來，她受了被人遺棄的刺激，現在又失去了兩個愛子，這是多大的悲劇呵！</p>

<h3>以木代油的汽車</h3>
<p>— 明德</p>
<p>頃閱德文交通雜誌。見有德國以木代油汽車之記載。特譯之於後。以供硏究汽車燃料者之參考。</p>
<p>用固質之燃料。如木。如煤。如代替流質燃料。如汽車。揮發油。以發動工廠及車輛之引擎。早經法人於歐戰後試更成功。法國化氣代油爐最佳之構。莫若殷倍特（Imbert）氏所發明者。現在法國軍用汽車。幾全部改用殷氏化氣爐。以代汽油矣。</p>
<p>德國方面。亦幾經試騐。先造煤化氣爐。裝於汽車。但煤化氣爐內。所砌火磚。經車輛行動時之震動。甚易脫落。不能合用。後乃改用殷氏木化氣爐。成績甚佳。較之用油。約可省費百分之九十二。</p>
<p>殷氏木化氣爐。可分四大部份。卽化氣爐身。凝濾器。風扇。氣管是也。爐之全部共重約一百至一百五十公斤。化氣爐身。係用鐵板製成。形如圓管。分內外兩層。高約一·五公尺。徑〇·五公尺。內中並無爐火磚及冷却用之水套。爐身下部有孔多處。一部份之孔。有蓋可開閉。用以査騐爐中所存木炭之多少。其他一部份之孔。內有舌瓣。向裏開閉。生火時由此孔燃點木炭。旣着火後。爐內化氣所需空氣。亦由此流入。但爐內之氣。往外流動時。舌瓣卽自閉。此外尚有出灰孔。亦在下部。爐身上部有蓋。蓋啟後可裝木柴。凝濾器四具。各形如鐵管。長一·四公尺。徑〇·二五公尺。內裝篩形隔板。化成之氣。均須先經此篩濾。而至引擎。以上為爐之全體構造。至於應用方法。先將化氣爐。下部盛木炭。上部裝木柴。（無論何種大片木層均可。惟不得長過八公分）爐上之蓋。封閉後。卽由燃點孔將燃着之引火物挿入。一面開動風扇。爐內木炭卽燃燒。但因空氣太少。作不完全之燃燒。而發生氣體。約燃三四分鐘後。爐內所生之氣。已足使引擎發動。於是爐中之氣。經氣管先至凝濾器。將氣中所含之水分及灰屑。凝留於凝濾器中。此净潔冷却之氣。再經氣管風扇而至空氣門。此處與外間流入空氣和合。成為引擎合用之氣。經引擎之進氣門而入汽缺。引擎發動之後。風扇卽可停止動作。以後爐內之氣流。完全由引擎吸引之。氣車引擎停止十五分鐘左右。爐中之氣。尚能發動引擎。惟倘引擎。停止過久。必須用風扇重要生火。風扇可用手搖。倘欲廢除風扇。則有二法。　將爐中所生之氣。儲存一部份於另一箱內。發動引擎。卽用此儲存之氣。　最初用汽車發動引擎。</p>
<p>殷氏化氣爐所生之氣。用於引擎中。每一立方公分。得爆漲氣壓二十公斤。較之汽油每立方公分約小十公斤。汽缺中燃度亦較低。因此引擎動作極穩靜。且於夏日可少引擎發燃弊。至燃料之消耗。每次爐中可裝木柴約一百公斤。可行七十至九十公里之路程。與汽油比較。第二·二公斤木柴。可代替一公斤之汽油。故費用極省。</p>

<p>一九三五年業已結束。一九三六年剛纔開始。美國的汽車製造事業。在這個時候。正是最緊要的關頭。各車廠為應付各方面的需要。儘量地把新車造出來。在顧客方面呢。也因為一九三六式新車業已登塲。在這個時候已决定他們所要購買的車子。定單便似雪片般的由銷售商手中送到廠裏去。據底特羅消息。一九三五年歲尾。十一月和十二月這兩個月間。各廠所製造的汽車。其總數大約在七〇〇，〇〇〇輛左右。這個數目。倒是不可輕看的。各廠間的主要生產者。當然仍推福特和雪佛蘭居首。它們的出品是高踞首位的。每星期的產額在九〇，〇〇〇輛左右。汽車界中人預料如果沒有什麽意外的事情發生。而令汽車銷路受到打擊。那沒各廠的製造計劃。將完全依照預定着的進行。廠裏的出品和銷路方面。同趨着一個步調。前途堪說不錯。總之廠方的出貨全依着銷路而定。市塲一有變化。不難臨時調整的哩。</p>
<p>自從秋季的汽車展覽會舉行以來。底特羅的汽車事業便呈着一種活躍的氣象。這是諸多不加否認的。這次展覽會中推銷員所佔便宜的。就是他們能立刻答應顧客。把新車迅速的交貨。比不得往年正月裏開展覽會的時候。顧客們要貨。而廠中遲遲不能交送。呌人非常地不耐煩。推銷員在去秋的新車展中。又發覺大多數的顧客。都預備着現錢。立刻要把中意的新車帶將回家。因為車子銷數旺盛的緣故。各廠都開日夜工。竭力趕造。底特羅的僱工指數也隨着上漲。最高的時候和一九三三年中九月份相仿。</p>
<p>我們衹要一看各廠的星期產量。就可知道底特羅的緊張空氣了。各廠的每週出車數額如下。福特二五，〇〇〇輛。雪佛蘭二五，〇〇〇輛。潑萊茅斯九，〇〇〇輛。道琪七，五〇〇輛。寳塔克六，〇〇〇輛。哇爾特斯麻別爾五，〇〇〇輛。別克四，五〇〇輛。赫特森透拉平三，五〇〇輛。派卡二，〇〇〇輛。納許拉飛愛脫一，三五〇輛。司蒂倍克一，〇〇〇輛。其他各廠每週造車約在一，〇〇〇輛之下者。為數很多。各種車輛中之產量比較的最多者。要算售價介乎美金一，〇〇〇千左右的，別克·派卡·道琪·賓塔克·哇爾特斯麻別爾。及納許等車的暢銷。可覘略高價車的銷路良好。這種情形。在一九三一，一九三二，一九三三，和一九三四等年是截然不相同的。在一九三五年歲尾看起來。福特·通用·和克雷斯勒幾家大廠獲利最為豐厚。可是一般人的心理。一九三六年對於幾家獨立廠家。倒是個很好的年頭。最近在紐約和支加哥所舉行的銷售員會議。已明顯地表示。各小廠家的努力為他們的業務奮鬥。</p>
<p>司蒂倍克在十二月中舉行努力的推銷計劃據推銷副經理喬治開　說。十二月份的總產額可達一〇，〇〇〇輛。該公司的樂士安極立斯新廠的產額可增多一，〇〇〇輛之譜。納許對於一九三六式新車的推銷。也已定有具體的計劃。最主要的便是利用盛大的廣吿競銷。預計一九三六的銷數當增加百分之七十五。納許和拉飛愛脫的一九三五年產額。其數目約在七五，〇〇〇輛之間。預計增添產額之後。其總數當選一三〇，〇〇〇輛。</p>
<p>一九三五年赫潑麻別爾的銷數。較之已往的三數年。均見顯著的增進。去年的十個月中。該公司曾遇到訟事的糾紛。目下一切都民解决了。推銷部也經過改組。另委麥克唐乃爾為主任。葛萊亨潘奇的一九三六年銷售計劃。着眼於超裝式型的新式低價車。國內和海外的銷路都在刻意推廣之中。這個計劃和該公司副經理葛萊亨的推廣世界市塲。可謂不謀而合了。赫特森預計本年一月一日止其產量當達三三，五〇〇輛。這個比了先期所計的二五，〇〇〇輛要增加許多了。據銷售部副經理脫拉舍稱。紐約的展覽會中的零售數。已打破五年來的紀錄。較了前年增加了兩倍又半。</p>
<h3>奧博爾廠出品　夏令配克號四汽缸車不日到申</h3>
<p>德國奧博爾汽車廠。茲以一九三六年夏令配克運動大會。將在柏林舉行。爰為紀念盛會起見。特精製夏令配克號四汽缸車行世。新車式樣。新穎美妙。機械工程。彌見精良。現悉不日即可運抵此間。由本埠經售商合衆汽車公司經售云。</p>
<h3>一九三六年式黑潑摩別爾新車</h3>
<p>— 敷</p>
<p>不日在滬舉行展覽</p>
<p>一九三六年式六缸及八缸黑潑摩別爾新車。因裝有設計改造之新式車身。與駕駛操縱無往而不得心應手之特優變速機。故其效用宏偉卓絕。式樣極美妙動人。頃據本埠黑潑摩別爾經售商康太汽車公司營業主任顧德南君宣稱。此項新車。至遲儘本月底。卽可公開陳列。以與滬人士相見。蓋顧君刻正積極佈置。冀可於本月份最後一星期內。於福煦路六二七號樣子間。舉行新車首次展覽也。</p>
<p>黑潑摩別爾出品。素以式樣美妙。著稱於世。今則新車尤為漂亮壯觀。新車共分兩大組。其曼妙之姿態。不僅賞心悅目。引人入勝。不特能减少空氣阻力至最低限度已也。其內部且更軒敞寬暢。重量與乘客儘量。均經重新分配。故凡置身其中。彌極舒適之至。此外尤足稱者。黑潑摩別爾。除於二十八年來。以絕對可靠與經久耐用。蜚聲於世外。關於設計與搆造方面。其所具機械工程上的特色。尤屬不勝枚舉。按此種種優點。而僅價格倍蓗之車輛有之。今則黑潑摩別爾新車。無不畢備之。斯誠尤為難能可貴者也。</p>
<h3>英國製造八輪貨車</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>—運費非常經濟—</p>
<p>英國海外運輸指導委員會。幾年以來。正在硏究一種經濟的運輸方法。以補救鐵路運輸的運費較高。這種運輸的方法。一方面可减少費用。他方面更可不必加重道路的維持費。其目的無非在發展殖民地的轉運事業。第一組運輸車遠在一九三三年由黃金海岸政府訂購若干車輛。先行嘗試。第二年才再度訂購一組。包括一輛八輪牽引車。八個車輪都可轉動。載重三噸。和兩輛八輪拖曳車。每輛載重六噸。因此。十五噸貨物。可以裝載在二十四個輕氣車胎的上面。給予地面上的壓力。每方吋比通常三十個CW七的運貨車少多。就為了車輪加多的關係。在海外各地。行駛的貨車。所輾及地面的壓力。要算這種車輛最輕了。所有的輪軸。完全可以獨立而直動。以减少車輛在路面上行駛時的震力。至於拖曳車上。四個一組。兩組車輪。裝在一起。就是完全鎖着的時候。也不會離去車上的輪轍的。</p>
<p>第二組車輛在製造方面。彼此不無相同之處。而關於拖曳車方面。由聯合車廠秉承指導委員會所指示的一切而承造的。採用柴油引擎。以代汽車引擎。衹有第一個和第四個車輪可以滑動。在製造和維持方面。都可减低不少費用。關於載重方面。和第一組相同。也是十五噸。但如果在平坦的道路上面。那麽拖曳車可以加至八噸。而牽引車可以加至四噸。所以三輛貨車。可運貨二十噸。試車的時期。開初在澳洲中部。行駛九，九三七哩的路程。接着在南部又駛行五五〇哩。北部到過奧爾斯賓。然後駛往巴爾登。就是北澳鐵路的終點。此外又到過若干地點。總之。試車的結果。什麽都是很滿意。而且試車所過的地</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Evaluation of Real Estate</h3>
<p>— Duan</p>
<p>Ever since the promotion of the legal tender, some have said that real estate must improve. This saying is indeed true, but we should not expect too much too soon. Lately, small plots of land have seen some transactions, but large-scale real estate remains inactive. Vacant land in prime locations has been empty for a long time. Although newly built city houses are emerging like fish scales and combs, advertisements for vacant houses offering rent reductions are still seen everywhere, and rental disputes arise repeatedly. The rent reduction movement continues unabated. Solving these kinds of problems is indeed very difficult. Some believe that the reason for this difficulty is the challenging re-evaluation of real estate. In fact, since this kind of commodity exists on the market, there should be a price to be found. The reason for the sluggishness of real estate is due to the market downturn and the speculative frenzy of the past. However, the market will not be without real estate transactions. Since there are transactions, there must be prices. Although this kind of price fluctuates greatly due to supply and demand, in general, it should be based on cost.</p>
<p>From this, we can know that the price changes of building materials are indeed an important factor in the evaluation of houses. This is not difficult to find in the building materials index of the Shanghai wholesale price index table. The prices included in this index are eleven, such as fir, construction pine, Douglas fir, sawn timber, tongue-and-groove boards, lime, cement, bricks, glass, raw lacquer, and paint oil, all of which are included. Except for steel bars and French nails, which still need to refer to the metal index, it can be said that everything is available. However, observing the overall trend, there has been a significant decline in recent years. For the convenience of readers, the building materials index is listed below (prices in 1926 are taken as 100%):</p>
<p>1927 105.4 1928 103.0 1929 108.1</p>
<p>1930 118.2 1931 135.4 1932 124.4</p>
<p>1933 113.1 1934 106.9 1935 99.1</p>
<p>The price in 1931 was the highest, so the index reached 135.4. Since then, it has declined year by year. In mid-April of last year, it was equivalent to the average price in 1926. After May, it declined further until the implementation of the legal tender in November, when it began to rebound. However, its average is still smaller than that of 1926.</p>
<p>Since the real estate evaluation has this basis, and then adding other equipment costs, a fairly complete evaluation can be expected. If the evaluation problem can be solved according to this, then the rent reduction dispute can also be easily solved.</p>

<h3>Guangzhou is Covered with Military Police Throughout the City Military Police Conduct Large-Scale Searches of Zhongda, Minda, and Dormitories of Various Middle Schools Miao Peinan is the Martial Law Commander, Strictly Prohibiting Strikes, Gatherings, and Associations</h3>
<p>Hong Kong On the 13th, Chen Jitang announced a martial law order, appointing Miao Peinan as the martial law commander, prohibiting strikes, work stoppages, school strikes, and gatherings and associations, banning newspapers and printed matter, inspecting mail and telecommunications. The city is covered with military police, and the guard is strict. Machine guns are set up in front of various agencies, and troops are also sent to guard various schools. On the morning of the 14th, military police conducted large-scale searches of Zhongda, Minda, and dormitories of various middle schools, and the situation is extremely serious. On the 14th, students did not parade. All primary schools are allowed to suspend classes for five days. Li Shuzong said that this decision to impose martial law was purely to prevent students and has nothing to do with the political situation. It can be lifted in a few days. It is rumored that the constitution has arrested more than 30 students, which is not true. However, if students parade again, they will definitely be brought to justice. (Special dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>Guangzhou After the student conflict yesterday, order was quickly restored. Last night passed peacefully. The streets are under martial law, and there are very few pedestrians. Only armed soldiers are seen patrolling back and forth to prevent accidents. Martial law continues today. Military police are still stationed on various main roads. The authorities are now prohibiting gatherings, parades, and the distribution of inflammatory texts. According to official sources, some students were threatened with guns for refusing to participate in the parade, so martial law had to be imposed to quell the chaos. All schools are now ordered by the Department of Education to suspend classes. The British consul has now notified British nationals not to stay in Chinese territory after 8:00 pm to avoid detention or search. Other consuls have also taken similar actions. The Japanese authorities here have always paid serious attention to student anti-Japanese parades. This afternoon, it was learned that the Japanese consul had lodged a serious protest with the authorities regarding the recent student parade. However, the announcement of martial law was the result of yesterday's incident and not due to the Japanese consul's protest. The safety of Japanese residents does not seem to be a problem, because except for a hospital and a pharmacy, other Japanese shops are all within the Shamian concession. Personnel from the Japanese consulate are now continuing to pay close attention to the situation, but the situation seems to have improved because all parades and demonstrations have now stopped. With strict precautions, students will not riot again. The arrested students and teachers have not yet been released. According to the garrison commander here, the martial law order is only temporary and will be revoked after the student unrest passes. Troops are now stationed in all schools in the city, especially Sun Yat-sen University. Student groups have now dispersed, and most students have returned home. Very few people participated in the National Salvation Volunteer Army. Because the military police headquarters heard that students were hiding weapons, it conducted a strict search of various schools in the city today and heard that it found some pistols that had been issued permits and some that had not been issued passports. All students who are not prepared to join the volunteer army and are unwilling to return to class have returned to their hometowns one after another this afternoon. At the same time, the martial law order is still in effect. The city is divided into four districts, which are respectively responsible for defense by military academy students, military police, military police, and training divisions. Armored vehicles patrol the streets. Traffic is prohibited from 1:00 am to 6:00 am at night. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>

<p>London British naval experts today predicted that Japan's withdrawal from the London Naval Conference will have the following effects: Japan's position in East Asia will become more consolidated, and it can step up its plan to dominate China.

Britain will seek the understanding of the United States and will seek an understanding on the East and the Pacific. It is said that Britain hopes that the United States will help it sanction Japan's expansion plan. The dictatorship of the Japanese warlords will become more profound, and popular groups that support parliamentary politics will return to the dark ages as after the Manchurian Incident from 1931 to 1932.

<h3>Situation at Today's Meeting Five Countries Will Declare No Competition in Shipbuilding</h3>
<p>London Whether Japan will continue to participate in the Naval Conference is still a question today. This depends on how the chairman can safely navigate the difficult issue of Japan's equality demands at the next meeting of the First Committee, because the outcome of the vote on this issue will inevitably cause Japan to leave the conference. Although the attitude of the Japanese delegation makes people firmly believe that the dispute over equality demands must be dealt with sooner or later, there was an unexpected development in the conference affairs last night, because after the British and Japanese delegations met for two hours, it was announced that today's important meeting would be postponed again to allow the Japanese representatives to continue to ask Tokyo for instructions. According to news here today, if Japan withdraws from the conference, it intends to suggest that the five countries issue a joint declaration stating that they do not want to compete in shipbuilding, so that the friendly relations between the countries will not be disturbed. News from Tokyo said that if the Naval Conference causes an arms race due to the postponement, Japan intends to try to adjust international relations. All newspapers here said that if Japan's equality proposal is put to a vote, it will inevitably be rejected. If so, Japan will definitely stop participating in the Naval Conference. However, all newspapers expect that other countries will not hastily put Japan's proposal to a vote. The conference will agree to accept this proposal and continue to study it, so that the five-nation conference can safely proceed with the issue of qualitative restrictions.

<p>London According to the Naval Conference's reporter, the Japanese delegation will withdraw from the conference after the General Committee meets in the next two days. Although this is not the final decision in theory, there is no major change. The result of the consultations between the British and Japanese delegations yesterday has proved that there is absolutely no possibility of a compromise on Japan's proposal for a common maximum amount of naval power. According to British representatives, the country was originally prepared to further discuss Japan's demands, but when Britain consulted with other delegations, all of them opposed the Japanese proposal, showing that a compromise was indeed hopeless. When the General Committee meets tomorrow, all of its time will be spent listening to the report of the Japanese representatives and the replies that the representatives of other countries intend to propose. However, it is expected that the report of the Japanese representatives will be very lengthy, so the replies of the representatives of various countries will largely be postponed to the meeting the day after tomorrow. According to this reporter, the wording of the Japanese representatives' report is still mild. The purpose of this is probably not to allow the countries to use Japan's tough attitude as an excuse to blame Japan for the failure of the Naval Conference. Generally speaking, the Naval Conference will end in the middle of this week, unless a miracle occurs that can suddenly change Japan's attitude, then there is no hope of reversing the country's withdrawal, because the country's delegation has asked Tokyo for instructions on the procedures to be taken when withdrawing from the conference. As far as the representatives of other countries are concerned, the representatives of Britain and the United States met once this morning and contacted the representatives of France and Italy separately beforehand. As a result, it is heard that it has been decided that after Japan withdraws from the conference, the representatives of the four countries will continue to meet. At that time, it will be difficult to understand whether Japan will send observers to attend to monitor the development of the conference. Regarding this level, the Japanese delegation declared that the country's attitude will be based on the positions taken by the representatives of other countries at the meetings in the next two days.

<p>Tokyo The Japanese government, due to the fact that the disarmament conference has reached a state of actual breakup, is preparing to declare Japan's disarmament policy to China and foreign countries, and to notify the people of the international situation after the breakup. At the same time, it is studying Pacific defense and other necessary issues with related agencies such as the Army and Navy. (Domei Telegram on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Japanese Contact Fails Nagano Talks About Actively Expanding Strength Hereafter</h3>
<p>London When Nagano and Nagai, the two plenipotentiaries, met with the British delegation at 6:10 pm on the 13th, they proposed that Japan intends to explain the common maximum case in detail in the First Committee and hopes that the representatives of all countries will review this issue, which was agreed by the British representatives. Therefore, it was decided that the First Committee would explain the Japanese government's disarmament policy in detail again by the Japanese representatives, and the representatives of all countries would open their opinions, but there is little doubt that their opinions expressed opposition. Nagano also proposed to end the meeting satisfactorily to avoid the deterioration of the national situation, and the British representative also expressed agreement, deciding not to put the common maximum case to a vote, and the Japanese representative also did not adopt extreme attitudes such as withdrawing from the venue, but decided to notify the speaker in writing that they would not attend future meetings, but only send observers to attend. (Domei Telegram on the 13th)</p>
<p>London After the private Anglo-Japanese talks on the 13th, Plenipotentiary Nagai said to others: "Now that things have come to this point, it is no longer possible to salvage the situation with any diplomatic skills. Originally, this was as expected. Other governments also know our determination. Now that we have reached this point, we cannot achieve what we hope for. Hereafter, there is no other way but to unite from top to bottom and strive to expand national strength. Our delegation has always fought hard at the conference, and we can reach this point today, which depends on the background of national strength. Therefore, we must now feel more deeply that there is nothing to rely on except strength." (Domei Telegram on the 13th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Representatives Meet With France and Italy No Way to Break the Stalemate</h3>
<p>Paris Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval met with Japanese Ambassador Sato on this day. It is generally known that the two discussed the international situation, which is the situation of the Naval Conference. Laval then met with US Ambassador Strahlos and discussed something.

<p>London Italian representative Biscaccia visited the Japanese delegation at 11:00 am on the 13th and had a cordial conversation with Plenipotentiary Nagano for 40 minutes. After Biscaccia explained the Italian government's shipbuilding announcement, he explored the true intentions of the Japanese government and sought to mediate in order to break the deadlock in the meeting. Plenipotentiary Nagano expressed his gratitude for his kindness, while affirming that the Japanese government cannot change its fundamental policy and requesting that the Italian government support Japan's common maximum case.

<h3>Japanese Naval Observation Naval Conference Ends on the 15th</h3>
<p>Tokyo The Japanese naval authorities expressed a clear view on the decision of the Japanese delegation not to participate in the conference. When the arguments of the two sides are fundamentally divergent, no matter what kind of meeting is held, it is difficult for the meeting to proceed without a concession from one side. Japan will absolutely not concede, and the United States and Britain will not allow Japan's proposal, which can be interpreted as a de facto head-on collision. No matter what its form, it is not a problem. The four-nation conference without Japan's participation is not a conference based on existing treaties, so the four-nation conference is a newly created conference and has nothing to do with Japan. It is obvious that a disarmament agreement without Japan's participation cannot be implemented. It is also quite obvious that the United States and Britain will not waste time concluding such a meaningless treaty, so the conference may end on the 15th. (Domei Telegram on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Movements in Japanese Industry: Naval Competition Benefits Industry</h3>
<p>Tokyo: At the International Disarmament Conference convened in London, Japan's proposed common maximum limit was not approved. Consequently, the Japanese plenipotentiary announced their withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference. Regarding this matter, concerning the impact on Japanese industry, the views of the industrial sector are summarized as follows: The breakdown of the Disarmament Conference was largely anticipated. Contingency measures were already considered and incorporated during the compilation of this year's military budget. Now that the breakdown of the conference is a reality, although countries may not immediately engage in competitive shipbuilding, it is self-evident that this will ignite their military expansion fervor. From a domestic perspective, this will be influenced by the current improvement in the British and American financial sectors, and thus the Japanese domestic industrial sector will also take advantage of the momentum to prosper. However, in the future, the military-related industries of the United Kingdom and the United States will experience greater development, leading to better financial conditions, and the Japanese financial sector will also benefit from this. As for domestic military-related industries such as ironworks, shipbuilding, and chemical industries, they will continue to exhibit vitality. As a result, the entire industrial sector can develop an active situation. From an external perspective, export trade will not suffer a blow in the future and will continue to maintain last year's advantages. The instability of the European political situation and the atmosphere will become increasingly perilous. The international relations between Britain, France, Italy, and Germany cannot be resolved quickly. Ultimately, Japan seems to have considerable benefits to gain. Furthermore, with the continued improvement of the British and American financial sectors, Japanese goods can also be exported more to Europe and the United States. As for the Far East, Near East, and Southeast Asia, Japanese goods are traditionally recognized for their low prices and good quality. Now, due to the renewed recognition of Japan's national strength, an increase in exports can also be expected. In the past, the export of Japanese goods has overcome countless obstacles to achieve today's prosperity. Therefore, even if more obstacles arise in the future, it will surely proceed smoothly and will not lead to pessimistic situations. As for the China issue, Japan should strive to promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations from its own independent position. China will also correct its perceptions based on the global situation. Therefore, in this aspect, we believe that improvement can be expected. It seems that observation is not without possibility, and so on. (14th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Italy Inclined to Reopen Peace Talks; Britain and France Hold No Extravagant Hopes; Feel Negotiations Extremely Difficult in the Current Environment; League of Nations Sending Investigation Team Draws Attention</h3>
<p>London: Although there are some indications that Rome is inclined to consider the suggestion of reopening negotiations, Paris and London are not optimistic about peace in East Africa and feel that new negotiations are extremely difficult in the current environment. The League of Nations' proposal to send an investigation team to Abyssinia is drawing much attention. It is generally felt that this matter must be decided by the Committee of Thirteen. It is reported that France wants to know the views of the United States and other countries before taking a definite stance. At the same time, those in charge in Rome have dismissed reports from London and Paris about new peace proposals as nonsense. Mr. Gaeta, who is regarded as the mouthpiece of the Italian government, continues to publish articles in the Italian newspaper, stating that Italy today still holds the full initiative as on October 3 (the day the Italian army began its invasion of Abyssinia) and is not distracted by peace talks. The Italian government is now focusing on dealing with the war in East Africa and resisting the sanctions imposed on Italy by Europe. The temporary lull in the war in Abyssinia is not due to the European situation or Abyssinia's strong resistance, but entirely due to military strategists seeking the benefits of the war in the best possible condition. However, peace in Abyssinia, when it appears in the future, will not be a hasty bankruptcy liquidation as desired by those advocating sanctions, but a concrete combination of all of Italy's demands.

<h3>Italian Ambassador Visits French Foreign Minister; Only Discusses the Matter of Sending an Investigation Team</h3>
<p>Rome: It is rumored that the Italian government has put forward new proposals regarding the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. According to official sources, the Italian government recently only suggested that the League of Nations send an investigation team to Abyssinia when its ambassador to France, Cerruti, returned home for the New Year. Apart from this, no other proposals have been put forward. As for the cessation of military action by Italy to facilitate the work of the investigation team, this has never been considered. Official sources also believe that there is no urgent need to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute at present. (14th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris: The Italian Ambassador to France, Cerruti, recently returned home to spend the New Year holidays and repeatedly met with Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Suvich to discuss the current situation. He has now returned to his post after the holiday. Today, he was received by Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman declined to announce what was discussed. However, according to this agency's diplomatic correspondent, Cerruti did not bring any new instructions that would change the current situation of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. People in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also believe that before the meeting of the Council of the League of Nations and the Committee of Eighteen, there will be no new developments regarding the reconciliation plan for the Italian-Abyssinian dispute and the strengthening of sanctions. It is also doubtful whether the committees of the League of Nations handling the Italian-Abyssinian dispute will be able to adopt any resolutions at that time, because the new US Neutrality Act cannot be voted on and passed before the 20th of this month. (13th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris: According to reliable sources here today, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini personally sent a letter to French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval, guaranteeing that even if the Council of the League of Nations passes an expanded scope of sanctions, Italy will never withdraw from the League of Nations or attack Britain. Observers believe that Mussolini's statement is clearly intended to clarify the current tense atmosphere in Europe. (13th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Abyssinian Emperor Prepares to Go to the Front Line; Supervises Troops to Attack Magale; One Says the Offensive Has Already Begun</h3>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: It is reported that the Emperor recently sent a telegram from Taissy City to the Abyssinian Patriarch Kopros, saying, "All the national troops have gone to the front line. I plan to go to the front line to supervise the troops on the 20th of this month. Please pray for the soldiers at the front." Royal family members have expressed opposition to the Emperor's personal expedition, but the Emperor's intention is quite firm. According to this agency's special correspondent, Orzana, the northern Abyssinian army will attack the city of Magale at any moment, or perhaps has already launched an offensive, it is not known. Regarding this matter, General Gaben, originally stationed in the Wossa district of the Eastern Route, has been ordered to lead fresh troops to the Tigre Province. It is also reported that the Abyssinian army captured four Italian aircraft and twelve motorcycles near the holy city of Aksum. (14th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Britain Holds Defense Conference; Cabinet Also Scheduled to Meet Today</h3>
<p>London: The Defense Committee held its first formal meeting this afternoon in Downing Street after the holiday. It is reported that this meeting is a sign that the Standing Committee of the Cabinet is resuming its work and preparing for the reopening of Parliament. (13th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: This agency's correspondent has learned that most cabinet members now believe that the outcome of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute should allow the League of Nations to achieve a victory, but neither Italy should be defeated nor Abyssinia should win. The Cabinet is scheduled to meet on the 15th, as the Council of the League of Nations and the Committee of Eighteen will meet on the 20th of this month. Britain's attitude must be decided by the Cabinet, and Foreign Secretary Eden's instructions for attending the two meetings in Geneva must also be given promptly. This afternoon, the Cabinet Defense Committee met, chaired by Prime Minister Baldwin, and Foreign Secretary Eden also attended and participated in the discussion, which was to prepare for the Cabinet meeting on the 15th. It is reported that the cabinet members' opinions on the embargo on petroleum seem to be inconsistent. Some cabinet members believe that Italy's ultimate failure is inevitable, so strengthening sanctions seems to be of no benefit. Other cabinet members believe that a complete ban on petroleum can shorten the war period, and Italy will not weaken its position in Europe due to the prolonged war and depletion of its strength. As for the League of Nations' need to achieve a final victory so that the indigenous peoples under the control of European powers will be warned and dare not revolt, this is a common consensus. All cabinet members hold this view. Furthermore, Germany's rearmament is proceeding steadily. Once the plan is completed, it will put forward demands and will no longer respect the collective security system. This situation is extremely worrying. Therefore, Italy's power in Europe must be restored in an appropriate way. This is also the unanimous view of all cabinet members. (13th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>French Council of Ministers; Laval Reports on Diplomatic Situation</h3>
<p>Paris: The Council of Ministers was held at the Presidential Palace this morning at 10:00 a.m. and adjourned at 11:30 a.m. First, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval presented a report on the current diplomatic situation. It was decided that the Minister of the Navy, Pietri, would report on the developments of the London Naval Conference, and attention was paid to the fact that the Japanese representatives opposed the French proposal. According to this agency's correspondent, Prime Minister Laval reported to the Council of Ministers the recent conversations he had with Ambassador Chambellan stationed in Italy and the Italian Ambassador to France, Cerruti, stating that there are currently no developments in the reconciliation attempts and the strengthening of sanctions against Italy regarding the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. In addition, the Prime Minister also announced that he intends to submit two bills to the Chamber of Deputies, one proposing March 22nd and 29th as the dates for the Chamber of Deputies' re-election, and the other proposing to set the term of the current deputies to expire on April 20th, so that the new Chamber of Deputies can be convened on April 21st. Regarding this matter, the Prime Minister intends to solicit the opinions of deputies from all parties before making a final decision. However, it is reported that the Council of Ministers has not yet discussed the above two bills today. (14th Havas Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3>US Silver Bill; Senate Opinions Differ; Borah Advocates Maintaining Freedom of the Seas</h3>
<p>New York: Regarding the new US Silver Bill, it is reported that due to Senator Borah (former Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee) insisting that the United States should not abandon the traditional principle of freedom of the seas, opinions within the Senate Foreign Relations Committee are quite complex. Senator Nye (Chairman of the Munitions Manufacturing and Sales Investigation Committee) declared that he and his colleagues originally intended to expand the scope of the list of automatically embargoed items. However, this move would amount to an action that goes against the Neutrality Act and would allow Italy to accuse the United States of being a non-neutral country, so they have abandoned this intention.

<h3>British-Egyptian Relations; Lampson Stresses the Necessity of a Military Alliance</h3>
<p>Cairo: Sir Miles Lampson, the British High Commissioner in Egypt, met today with Pasha, the leader of the Egyptian "United Front" political party, and announced Britain's views on the Egyptian political situation, especially regarding the request for a British-Egyptian agreement based on the 1930 treaty. Sir Miles Lampson strongly argued that Egypt's military status had undergone major changes since 1930. For example, the 1930 treaty stipulated that 8,000 British troops be transported to the Suez Canal, but since then, the western part of Egypt has become a very important military location, and it takes considerable time to transport troops from the Suez Canal to the west. Finally, Sir Miles said that an Egyptian-British military alliance is very important, but Britain must know the attitude of Egyptian leaders on various public issues. At the same time, British military preparations are very rapid, and 5,000 sailors have set sail for Egypt. The current number of British troops stationed in Egypt is 40,000, and all kinds of military supplies, firearms, etc., continue to arrive in Egypt. At the same time, considerable attention is being paid to border defense. (14th National Agency dispatch)</p>

Bolivia pays a certain amount of money as nominal compensation for Paraguay's losses in the war. The two countries restore diplomatic relations. An unarmed zone is demarcated in the Chaco region, and each neutral country sends a committee to reside there to ensure Paraguay's security. The above draft has been agreed upon by the delegations of both Paraguay and Bolivia to the Peace Conference and is now being studied by the two governments.

<h3>Italy; Women's Patriotic Spirit; Adopting Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>Rome: Italian clothing stores have long rejected purely foreign or foreign-influenced fashions. Since the nationwide movement to resist sanctions began, this trend has been further promoted. Recently, the National Clothing Bureau, in order to encourage the use of domestic goods, specially created a special mark. All women's skirts made of domestic materials and using domestic styles must wear them for identification. In the past, even if women's clothing and hats were domestic products, they were often adorned with foreign manufacturers' trademarks to show off. This was the custom. The National Clothing Bureau's move is intended to stimulate the patriotic spirit of women. (13th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Pittman; Observations on Silver; US Silver Purchase Act Continues to Exist; Expects China and Mexico to Restore Silver Standard</h3>
<p>Washington: Senate silver advocate Pittman stated today that the US Silver Purchase Act of 1934 will remain in effect, although some leading merchants have proposed repealing or amending the Act. Pittman also criticized the annual report released yesterday by Handy &amp; Harman, saying, "I greatly admire the company's observation of silver from a commodity perspective, but their observation of silver is only that. I am different. I always consider silver from a currency perspective and use this as a starting point." Pittman criticized foreign governments for using propaganda and other methods to oppose the US silver law and predicted that China, Mexico, and other countries will soon restore the silver standard or expand the use of silver. Senate inflation advocate Thomas stated that Handy &amp; Harman's opposition to the silver law is due to the fact that the company's business and commissions have suffered losses after the implementation of the law. Before the United States purchased silver from foreign countries, the company actually manipulated the price of silver in the United States and earned commissions from it. Since the United States began purchasing silver from Mexico, Peru, Chile, and other places, the company's business has plummeted. Frankly speaking, the entire silver plan is manipulated by the enemy. Thomas stated after meeting with Mexican economic expert Oruza that he knew Mexico expressed good feelings about the plan, but it is difficult to say what will happen in the future.

<h3>US Supreme Court Ruling; Government Loses Again; Loses 200 Million Gold in Agricultural Products Sales Tax; Government Advantageous in Pennhyd Case Appeal Dismissed</h3>
<p>Washington: The US Supreme Court, which convened for only ten minutes today, has already caused the government to lose US$200 million in agricultural products sales tax, and the fate of another US$1 billion in collected sales tax remains uncertain. Regarding the Pennhyd Cotton Production Control Act, no direct ruling was made. According to the agricultural products sales tax portion, the appellants were eight rice mills in Louisiana. The Supreme Court ruled that all taxes paid during the litigation period must be refunded. As for other paid sales taxes, merchants must prove that they have not recovered this tax from consumers before they can demand a refund. Therefore, the future of the US$1 billion already collected by the government is still difficult to determine. The court dismissed the lawsuit of appellant Moore regarding the Pennhyd Cotton Production Control Act due to legal procedural reasons. However, the government of the state of Georgia also has a lawsuit regarding this Act on January 20, so it is still to be ruled at that time. (13th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Washington: The United States Supreme Court today ruled on two cases related to President Roosevelt's New Deal measures, one favorable to the government and one unfavorable to the government. The court upheld the Pennhyd Cotton Management Act and canceled the case of Moore in Texas, but in the case of the Louisiana rice mill, the court announced a ruling unfavorable to the government. Although the Pennhyd case is related to the New Deal measures, it is the work of the senators of the cotton-producing states, not the government itself. As for the Louisiana case, the court believes that the 200 million fee donation must be returned to the manufacturers. The court currently does not want to express its opinion on whether the Pennhyd case is legal or not, so its ruling can be considered favorable to the government. However, another lawsuit filed by the Governor of Georgia will give the Supreme Court the opportunity to continue to adjudicate the Pennhyd case. Pennhyd now claims that the bill he initiated is now effective and the Department of Agriculture has the right to continue to handle it in accordance with it to relieve cotton farmers. Cotton production this year can be protected. The reason why the Supreme Court justices did not express their views on the legality of the Pennhyd case is because they believe that this is a matter that should be tried by the lower courts and should not be brought before the Supreme Court. Therefore, the cancellation of this appeal cannot be regarded as a legal judgment of this case, and the fee donation that has already been paid to the cotton farmers can be recovered by the taxpayers. This is still an undecided issue, so the government's fear caused by the cancellation of the Agricultural Adjustment Act has not diminished.</p>
<p>The Louisiana rice mill case was filed by several rice mills in the state, requesting that the government be prevented from collecting fee donations based on the reason that this is not a true donation tax. The rice mill argued that this kind of donation tax is one of the ways to manage agricultural products. The government abused the collection of donation taxes, and therefore, it can only be used to raise national income to seek the well-being of the whole, rather than to seek the interests of a part of the people. (13th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: The Supreme Court's order yesterday that the government return the 200 million yuan it collected in fee donations to the Louisiana rice mills has caused the government to have an income and expenditure of 1 billion yuan. The Agricultural Adjustment Act has been revised, stipulating that if the Agricultural Adjustment Act is illegal, the donor can claim it back from the government. The fee donation is only part of what they pay from ordinary interests and has not been transferred to consumers. Now the Agricultural Adjustment Act has indeed been judged to be illegal, but this amendment has not yet been declared invalid by the court, so it depends on how the court rules whether the government will pay back 100 million yuan. In addition, there is still one point between the Supreme Court and the government, which is the Pennhyd Act. Although the court refused to accept the lawsuit filed by the cotton planters in Texas against this bill yesterday, it did not express the opinion that this bill is legal. The public believes that the lawsuit filed by the Governor of Georgia will inevitably fail the Pennhyd case when it is heard in the future. If the government cannot find an alternative solution, the failure of the Pennhyd Act will inevitably have a major impact on world cotton prices. (14th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>New Soil Conservation Plan; Replaces the Agricultural Adjustment Act; Principles Approved by the National Farmers Union</h3>
<p>Washington: The government's new soil conservation plan, which is used to replace the Agricultural Adjustment Act, has been approved in principle today by the executive meeting of the American General Farmers Union. The Association declared that the Soil Conservation Program has clearly completed a satisfactory plan for agricultural control. However, the Association requested that the government not repeal the law to deposit 30 percent of tariffs to subsidize agricultural exports. This plan is also named the Export Subsidy Program, which has been rejected by government leaders. President Roosevelt recently specifically raised the case to the press, considering it to be out of date. (13th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Mayors Request Allocation; Relief for 800,000 Unemployed</h3>

The mayors' requirements were directly submitted to Vice President Garner and House Speaker Byrns. The main purpose of this proposal, according to the mayors, is that the new work relief program led by Hopkins has failed to provide jobs for the 800,000 people awaiting relief. Local governments are now facing a serious problem, as they must take care of the food and clothing of those who have not obtained work. (13th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Famous British Writer Rudyard Kipling Critically Ill; His Works Popular Worldwide, Royalties Exceed £350,000</h3>
<p>London—Famous author Rudyard Kipling is seriously ill. After undergoing surgery at the Middlesex Hospital yesterday morning, his condition is now critical. It is reported that he is suffering from a severe stomach ailment. Kipling, aged 70, left his home in Sussex last week and arrived in London to prepare for a winter trip abroad, as he often travels when feeling unwell. The hospital issued a report last night stating that Mr. Kipling's condition was quite serious, but he was still able to hold on a month ago. Another report issued early this morning stated that his condition was very critical at midnight. Kipling is married to an American woman, and his works are beloved by Americans. According to his publisher, Doubleday, Doran &amp; Company, Kipling's works sell 100,000 copies annually without slowing down. In the past forty years, his works have sold 3.5 million copies in the United States, with royalties exceeding $1.75 million (or £350,000). The most popular work is "The Jungle Book," which has sold 250,000 copies in the United States since its publication in 1894. Last year, Doubleday, Doran &amp; Company published a selection of Kipling's essays and poems titled "The Kipling Pageant" in commemoration of Kipling's December 30th birthday. The American Literary Guild selected it as a featured publication for December, and over 100,000 copies were sold in the first month. (Reuters Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Attitude Toward British-Japanese Talks; Opposes Limitation to China Only, Wants to Resolve Trade Issues in One Go</h3>
<p>Tokyo—Tokyo attaches great importance to rumors that Britain will propose British-Japanese talks to resolve the issue of harmonizing British and Japanese interests in China. It is rumored that British Foreign Secretary Eden is preparing to make a proposal to Japan. However, the Japanese Foreign Ministry has stated that it opposes limiting discussions with Britain solely to the issue of protecting British interests in China and hopes to resolve all kinds of British-Japanese trade issues in one go, demanding that Britain open its colonies around the world to Japanese access. However, Britain only seeks to alleviate conflicts of interest between Britain and Japan in the Far East. (China United Press Dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>National Language Lecture: How to Read (Part 2)</h3>
<p>Xia Gaizun, Chief Editor of Guanming Bookstore</p>
<p>The above is about reference books. Because the topic of reference books is determined at any time, when reading reference books, you must pay attention to the topic you are referring to, and don't let the topic be wasted. You should also pay attention to the preface and table of contents of that book, remember the general situation, and prepare for future convenient flipping.</p>
<p>The following should be about books for cultivating interest. I have talked about this type of book last time. The number does not need to be large, and the selection should be precise. You can just read one type of book until you are tired. This type of book should also make full use of reference books. For example, if you are now reading Du Fu's poetry collection, then sometimes you have to flip through Du Fu's biography, as well as other people's poetry talks about Du Fu's comments, and so on. If you are reading Wang Yangming's "Instructions for Practical Living," you have to flip through Wang Yangming's collection of works, his biographies, and the works of later generations on the debates between Cheng-Zhu and Lu-Wang schools. Make the book you are reading the center, and then use other books to help, so that you can make the book you are reading more clear, more practical, and more flavorful, and avoid the problem of superficiality.</p>
<p>The above is about the reading methods of three types of books. Regarding the word "reading" itself, there are still a few points I want to talk about. I just divided textbooks into two types of nature, one belongs to general science, which has a strict system, and one belongs to language and writing, which does not have a strict system. I also said that those belonging to general science should focus on reading, and those belonging to language and writing are not enough to just read, and should focus on reciting. Now let me go further, all books are written in language and writing. According to the general situation, a book can contain two kinds of nature. The book itself has content, and there is a system to be found in the content, and the nature belongs to general science. The book is written in language and writing, and if you study it from the form, it belongs to language and writing. A "Historical Records," from its content, is history, but you can also choose an article to use as a national language teaching material. The math textbooks you use, of course, belong to the math category, but from the perspective of language and writing, it is not impossible to use it as a writing reference model. The articles in math books are simple, accurate, and the order is very complete. It is a good example of academic writing. In this way, any book can be said in two ways. If you only look at the content, you can just read it. If you regard it as language and writing, then you must read it.</p>
<p>This broadcast, the Ministry of Education asked me to be responsible for the middle school national language lecture. I limit my lecture to reading, and what I talk about is only the general reading situation, and I have not specifically talked about the national language subject. You may say that what I said does not meet the scope and conditions set by the Ministry of Education. I have to declare that I do not recognize many independent so-called national language books. Among books, except for a very small number of grammar and rhetoric categories, everything else may not belong to the national language subject. Can we say that "The Analects," "Mencius," "Zhuangzi," and "Zuo Zhuan" are national language? Can we say that "Dream of the Red Chamber," "Water Margin," and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" are national language? But if you focus on the form and study it as language and writing, then there is nothing that is not material for the national language subject. Not only "The Analects," "Mencius," "Zhuangzi," and "Zuo Zhuan" are national language, "Dream of the Red Chamber," "Water Margin," and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" are national language, but also your physics textbooks and botany textbooks are national language, even Zhang San's land deed and Li Si's family letter are also national language. I think the so-called national language subject is a kind of homework for learning language and writing. Taking things that were originally written in language and writing and studying them as language and writing is the task of the national language subject. That's why I only talk about general reading and don't specifically bring up the national language subject. Please pay attention to this point.</p>
<p>Studying any book from the perspective of language and writing can be said to belong to the work of the national language subject. Reading can usually be divided into two types: skimming and intensive reading. The purpose of skimming is to understand and obtain content, and the purpose of intensive reading is to figure out and appreciate. I think that if you want to study the rules of language and writing, you should focus on intensive reading. The amount does not need to be large, but you must read carefully. It's like copying a calligraphy model. The purpose of copying a certain model is to match the brush strokes and write the character with its spirit, not to copy its words. Assuming that this model has a total of one thousand characters, instead of blindly copying it and writing one or two characters for the whole thing, it is better to select ten or twenty characters with changes and interesting meanings, and practice each character carefully several times, which will be more effective. When you read a novel, assuming it is Mao Dun's "Midnight," if you are learning language and writing, you should not pay attention to the story in the book, but you should pay close attention to the character descriptions, narrative methods, structure, and wording and sentence construction in the book. When you read poetry, assuming it is Xu Zhimo's poetry collection, if you are learning language and writing, you should not only pay attention to the general meaning of the poem, but also pay attention to its sentence construction, rhyme, rhythm, and aspects of expression, imagination, antithesis, and style. The changes and techniques in language and writing are actually not very many. As long as you can pay attention, you can probably see it in a small part. Assuming a book has five hundred pages, and each page has one thousand words, if you can understand the first page, then I dare to guarantee that you can understand the whole book. Because all the rules of language and writing in the whole book have probably appeared in the first page of one thousand words. For example, grammatical rules, such as the use of verbs, the use of conjunctions, the use of adjectives, the use of auxiliary words, and the combination of various sentences, have all appeared on the first page. I advise you to put more effort into intensive reading.</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, my words are about to end. I feel that there are many messy and incomplete places in what I have said. Please ask your teachers to correct them for me. Regarding reading in the middle school national language subject, I published many opinions a few years ago. What I said is quite different from this time. I remember there are two articles, one is called "On the Learning of Chinese Language," which is published in the "Learning Methods of Various Subjects in Middle School" in the Kaiming Youth Series, and the other is called "What Should Be Read Outside of Chinese Language Class," which is published in the "Art of Reading" in the Middle School Student Magazine. If you have never seen them, please go and see them yourself, or you may get some supplements for my lecture this time. My boring lecture wasted your after-school time. I'm very sorry. (End)</p>

<h3>Sino-British Yunnan-Burma Boundary Demarcation Commissioners Arrive at Survey Site</h3>
<p>The Sino-British Yunnan-Burma boundary demarcation commissioners and all staff arrived at the survey site of the undefined section of Yunnan-Burma boundary on the afternoon of November 30. The British side was stationed in Hu Suan, and the Chinese side was stationed in Nan Da, three miles east of Hu Suan. At 10:30 a.m. on December 1, the British commissioner welcomed the Chinese commissioner half a mile away from Hu Suan. At 11:00 a.m., the Chinese commissioner, along with Chief Secretary Mr. Li and 200 guards, arrived in Hu Suan by car. The British army gave a rifle salute to pay tribute. They invited the Chinese commissioner into the tent for tea and snacks. At 1:00 p.m., the Chinese and British commissioners jointly welcomed Mr. Islyn, a neutral commissioner specially appointed by the League of Nations. The national flags of China and Britain were raised in Hu Suan, and each side sent four soldiers to guard them. Other troops were lined up on the left and right. When the neutral commissioner Islyn arrived in Hu Suan, the Chinese army sounded the horn to welcome him. At the same time, the British army gave a rifle salute to pay tribute. Neutral Commissioner Islyn returned the salute to express his thanks. After the ceremony, he entered the tent prepared by the British side and opened a welcome meeting. British Commissioner Gross gave a speech, saying that he hoped that both parties would embrace the spirit of mutual concession in this demarcation to achieve the goal of success. Chinese Commissioner Liang Yugao said that he trusted that Britain was the most just country in the world and would never treat China unfairly. Neutral Commissioner Islyn said that he hoped that the Sino-British parties would not need him to say a word to demarcate the boundary, and so on. After that, the British side provided lunch, and the meeting ended.</p>

<h3>Catastrophic Flood in Ten Counties of Western Shandong to Cause Losses Reaching 100 Million Yuan, Local Vitality Unlikely to Recover Within a Decade</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The unprecedented flood in western Shandong last year, after a thorough investigation and statistics of the disaster losses by the Commissioner's Office of the Experimental Zone, is truly alarming. The hardest-hit areas include over 300 villages around Wang Guitun in the southwest of Jinning, over 300 villages in the south of Yuncheng, over 300 villages north of Qili River in Heze, over 600 villages north of Juye city, over 500 villages around Makeng in Yutai, over 300 villages in the southwest of Dongping, over 100 villages in Menguanji, Wenshang, over 60 villages in the northeast of Jinxiang, over 200 villages between the Zhao Wang and Zhu Rivers in Jiaxiang, and over 400 villages south of the dike in Juancheng. Currently, as the breaches have not been closed, the plains are still flooded to a depth of three to four feet, houses have collapsed, and livestock have been washed away. Apart from deaths, many disaster victims have fled to various counties. Even if they return to their villages, they not only lack clothing and food, but also have no land to cultivate and no houses to live in. Seeds, farm tools, cattle, and horses are all missing, and their livelihoods have been cut off, urgently requiring assistance. According to the statistics of the Commissioner's Office, the total property loss in these ten counties amounts to 97,888,000 yuan, truly an unprecedented catastrophe. It is feared that the local vitality will not easily recover even after ten years. The statistical table is recorded below:</p>

<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>Theft Case in This County Captured in Songjiang</p>
<p>The 12th Battalion Headquarters of the Provincial Security of this county received a report from Huang Shaoqi, the squad leader stationed in Caoxing, under the 1st Company Commander, regarding a suspected thief named Zhang Rongfu. Additionally, Fan Yonglin and Jiang Xianghai, soldiers dispatched by the 4th Company, 13th Battalion of Fengxian, brought the leader Lu Xiangfu, totaling four people. They stated that Fan and others came to Caoxing to investigate a case involving Zhang Rongfu, who was suspected of robbing Zhou, the head of Xu Jiaqiao Bao, in this county, and injuring an old woman during the process. Because they had no official documents, they apprehended Zhang Yinfu and sent him for punishment. Zhao Zanchen, the adjutant of the battalion, proposed an interrogation. According to Zhang Yinfu's confession, he was a fisherman and was forcibly boarded by thieves, who sailed the fishing boat to Xu Jiaqiao and landed to commit robbery. After the robbery, they returned to the boat, sailed back to Quelideng, and left. He denied being involved. Subsequently, the leader Chen Xiangfu confessed that Zhang Rongfu's robbery was based on information received and that Captain Liu was also aware of it. Due to the suspicion of robbery, Zhang and Chen were temporarily detained, and the investigation was reported to the county government.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Land and Water Police Launch Large-Scale Suppression of Lake Bandits</p>
<p>Manshan in Guangfu Township, isolated in Taihu Lake, was recently looted by lake bandits, who consecutively looted seventeen families in Nanmanshan, Beimanshan, and Zhongcun. The details of the incident have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Nie Dezhao, the attaché of the 7th Battalion of the Provincial Security, personally went to the township to investigate after the incident. Considering that the mountain is surrounded by the lake and a small number of police forces might not be able to defeat the bandits, he consulted with Zhou Weilie, the district chief of the 2nd Water Police District, upon returning to Suzhou. They decided to launch a joint suppression to maintain security. On the morning of the 14th, District Chief Zhou personally led the Baosu warship and special forces, departing from Suzhou and heading directly to Manshan in western Taihu Lake for a search. The Zhaowu warship was dispatched to cooperate with two teams from the 1st District and the 1st Company of the Security Force, heading to Daxuankou in Maji Mountain. The Pei Rong warship and the 3rd Company of the 1st Security Battalion, together with the 5th Team of the Zhejiang Water Police, headed to Xinkai River in eastern Taihu Lake. The Anqing warship and the 3rd Team headed to Hengta, launching a large-scale joint suppression, with Manshan as the central point. The public security bureaus of Dongting East and West Mountains are providing assistance as needed.</p>

<h3>Scientific Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Edited by the Science Society of China</p>
<p>Artificial Silk - Gao Fei</p>
<p>Looking at the name "artificial silk," we know that it is not silk spun by silkworms but a product created by scientists using synthetic methods. Although this invention has only been around for over fifty years, it now occupies a vast market in the world and has become one of the main fabrics welcomed by people. If we happily go to a silk store and look around, what is displayed in the glass windows and piled on the counters—shiny yarn, Parisian silk... all kinds of colors, a dazzling array—all of this is just artificial silk, or fabrics made by randomly combining artificial silk with silk, cotton, wool, etc.</p>
<p>Raw Materials for Artificial Silk Although there are many types of fabrics woven from artificial silk, the raw material is only one type: plant cellulose. Cellulose is a carbohydrate, which is the main component of all plants. However, since there are too many types of plants in the world, the amount of cellulose contained in plants varies. Cotton has the highest cellulose content, containing as much as 90%, while ramie also contains 80%. As for rice straw, bamboo, and wood, they only contain about 50%.</p>
<p>The Invention of Artificial Silk The first person to invent artificial silk was Count de Chardonnet of France in 1885. He dissolved cellulose in nitric acid to make low-nitrated cellulose, which is guncotton and can be used to make smokeless gunpowder. Then, he dissolved the nitrated cellulose in a mixture of alcohol and ether while hot to form a viscous substance. Then, he applied a pressure of 50 atmospheres to extrude this viscous substance through fine holes with a diameter of 0.08mm. Although the extruded material solidifies on the outside, it still retains the viscous substance inside. Taking advantage of this, very fine artificial silk can be made from it. However, since the silk contains nitric acid, it is easy to catch fire. To remove this weakness, after the alcohol and ether mixture has evaporated, ammonium sulfide must be used to completely wash away the nitric acid.</p>
<p>Types of Artificial Silk Production The raw material for artificial silk—cellulose—is truly an inexhaustible resource on the earth. However, dissolving it is not an easy task. Except for dissolving it with strong acid or strong alkali solutions, all other solutions are useless. Because of the different types of solutions used, the production of artificial silk is divided into four types. The following is a summary of these four types:</p>
<p>Nitrated Cellulose Artificial Silk Same as the invention of artificial silk, omitted.</p>
<p>Cuprammonium Hydroxide Solution Cellulose Artificial Silk The first step is to prepare the cuprammonium hydroxide solution. The method is to add caustic soda to copper sulfate solution, which will produce a precipitate. Then, add this precipitate to ammonia solution to obtain a dark blue cuprammonium hydroxide solution. The second step is to soak the cellulose in caustic soda solution for ten minutes, take it out, wash it with water, and then dissolve it in the prepared cuprammonium hydroxide solution to become acidified cuprammonium cellulose. Then, extrude this acidified cuprammonium cellulose solution through fine holes into sulfuric acid, which will solidify it into beautiful and shiny silk.</p>
<p>Viscose Artificial Silk Treat wood pulp for papermaking with caustic soda, then dissolve it in carbon disulfide to obtain a strongly viscous, orange-yellow solution. This solution can be used to manufacture photographic film, electrical insulators, artificial ivory, waterproof cloth, etc. As for the method of making artificial silk, this solution is also extruded through fine holes into ammonium chloride or sulfuric acid, and the sulfide is washed away to obtain solid and high-quality silk.</p>
<p>Cellulose Acetate Artificial Silk Add cotton or wood pulp to a mixed solution of glacial acetic acid, dehydrating acetic acid, and concentrated sulfuric acid, which will dissolve it to obtain cellulose acetate. In addition to dissolving cellulose acetate in acetone, chloroform, glacial acetic acid, etc., and extruding it through fine holes into water to make artificial silk, this material can also be used to manufacture photographic film, electrical insulators, and coatings for aircraft wings. Because this material only burns at the point of contact with fire and does not spread to other parts, it has the advantage.</p>
<p>Because there are the above four different manufacturing methods, each type of artificial silk produced has its own different characteristics. Although the raw materials are abundant and cheap, if the consumption of raw material treatment, the length of manufacturing time, and labor costs are taken into account, the value of artificial silk fabrics on the market will vary accordingly due to these differences.</p>
<p>The Relationship between Artificial Silk and Coal Tar Dyes Coal tar is the black, oily liquid with an unpleasant odor produced after the dry distillation of coal. This liquid was considered waste a hundred years ago, but now it has become an important raw material in industry. In addition to extracting many different important oils from this liquid, it can also be used to synthesize many dyes. The first person to invent the use of this liquid to synthesize dyes was Perpin of England in 1856, who obtained mauvine from the oxidation of aniline, as well as magenta and methyl violet dyes. Since then, many researchers have emerged, and today, the more than ten thousand synthetic dyes sold on the market are all thanks to coal tar, which was previously considered waste. The application of science is about how to turn what the general public considers waste into something useful for the masses. This is what scientists consider a major effort. From this, we can better understand how close and important science is to human life. I've gone too far. Now, let's get back to the topic. What is the use of dyes? The use of dyes is to dye fabrics made of cotton, hemp, wool, and silk in various colors. However, the essence of cotton and hemp is cellulose, while the essence of wool and silk is protein. Protein is easy to dye, while cellulose is more difficult. We can dye fabrics made of a single raw material, or we can dye fabrics made of artificial silk, cotton, hemp, wool, and silk in any combination. Therefore, if we look at fabrics made of any combination before dyeing, they initially look very white and even. However, after dyeing, each type of thread absorbs a special dye, and the complex composition is revealed as desired. The colors are soft, elegant, bright, and colorful, making the world more bright and joyful. Artificial silk increases its beauty because of dyes, and dyes expand their use because of artificial silk. They can truly be called inseparable brothers, complementing each other.</p>
<p>Comparison of Artificial Silk and Silk in Various Aspects Since the advent of artificial silk, its production volume has been increasing rapidly year by year, its quality has been improving day by day, and its demand has been expanding day by day, thus forming the only strong competitor to silk. The world's silk market has almost been monopolized by artificial silk. Here is a comparison of silk and artificial silk in various aspects, from which we can see that the future of artificial silk is booming and unlimited:</p>
<p>Quality As mentioned above, the essence of artificial silk is composed of cellulose, while the essence of silk is composed of protein. Although there are small differences in essence, due to the gradual improvement and increasing perfection of artificial silk, there are no difficulties in its application. Here are the three main points where the quality of artificial silk is currently inferior to that of silk, listed for comparison: First, artificial silk is heavier than silk, so the fabrics woven from it are also heavier and not as light as silk. Second, the elasticity of artificial silk is lower than that of silk, so the woven fabrics do not easily return to their original state after being wrinkled, which detracts from their appearance. Third, the strength of artificial silk is only one-third of that of silk and it easily absorbs moisture. In addition, the luster, dyeing, and weave of artificial silk are completely comparable to those of silk. As for our ability to freely customize any form we need—long or short, thick or thin, flat or round, shiny or matte—artificial silk can fully adapt, and a single strand can be spun into thousands of yards long without any knots or breaks, which is worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>Weave The essence of artificial silk is not as good as that of silk, but in terms of fabric suitability, it is not only comparable to silk, but also has two points that silk cannot match. Artificial silk can also be proud of this: First, artificial silk is suitable for weaving thick silk. Second, artificial silk has special applicability for wide fabrics, allowing it to be interwoven with wool and cotton.</p>
<p>Price The price of artificial silk has been falling in the market in recent years, just like silk. On the surface, it seems to be a bad phenomenon, but if we actually investigate, we should only worry about silk and not about artificial silk! In the last twenty years, the production of silk has not even doubled, while the increase in artificial silk has been more than twenty-two times. The price of artificial silk has fallen only because it is mechanically produced, and the cost can be quickly reduced due to technological improvements and the needs of society, resulting in increased production efficiency. Silk is different. The price of silk has fallen entirely because the market has been taken over, and it has no choice but to do so. Because silk is a type of agriculture and handicraft industry, progress in production technology is much slower than that of artificial silk, and costs cannot be reduced at will.</p>
<p>From the above three points, we can see that the quality of artificial silk is currently only worse than that of silk, but because of its suitable weave and affordable price, silk can only sigh with admiration. As for the luster and dyeing of artificial silk, it can be completely comparable to silk. In addition, its quality is improving day by day, becoming more perfect, and adapting to the current world economic crisis, thus providing people with a great need, so we can know that the future of artificial silk is indeed booming and unlimited.</p>

<h3>Central Committee Recommends Ju and Ye to Greet Hu in Hong Kong Today; Ju and Ye Arrive in Shanghai from Beijing with Chiang's Personal Letter</h3>
<p>The Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee, along with Vice Chairman Chiang and other Central Committee members in Beijing, expressed their delight upon hearing that Chairman Hu would be passing through Hong Kong soon. The committee nominated Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, and Ye Chucang, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, to travel to Hong Kong to greet him. They are to invite Mr. Hu to take the same ship to Shanghai and then enter Beijing to preside over important matters. Ju and Ye have already arrived in Shanghai from Beijing, carrying a new personal letter from Mr. Chiang to Mr. Hu. Chen Ce, a member of the Central Committee, is also traveling with them. Ju, Ye, and Chen arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning by train and visited Mr. Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the Central Political Council, for a meeting. This afternoon, they will set off on the Empress of Canada, accompanied by seven people, including Wu Tiecheng, the Mayor of Shanghai, and Li Dachao, the section chief representing the municipal government. Chen Jiayou, another member of the Central Committee, and Lin Hanlun, Mr. Hu's son-in-law, departed yesterday afternoon on the President Coolidge. We have obtained detailed information on various aspects as follows:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Last Night, Head South This Afternoon</p>
<p>Ju, Ye, and Chen, along with their secretaries and staff, left Beijing on the 11 o'clock night express train the night before last, arriving at the North Station around 7 a.m. yesterday. They returned to their residences to rest before heading to Anhe Temple Road at around 10:30 a.m. to visit Mr. Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the Central Political Council, for a meeting of about 45 minutes before departing. It is reported that Mr. Wang personally wrote a letter at that time, entrusting Mr. Ye and others to deliver it to Mr. Hu Hanmin, urging him to come north and jointly manage national affairs. Ju Zheng had originally planned to travel south with Xu Chongzhi, Vice President of the Control Yuan, but stopped due to an arm ailment. Now that his arm ailment has healed, he has decided to travel with Mr. Ye and others.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye First Negotiates in Shanghai</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency met Mr. Ye at the North Station yesterday and inquired about everything. According to him, he is traveling to greet Mr. Hu Zhantang. After arriving here this morning, he plans to first negotiate with relevant figures in Shanghai before taking a ship south tomorrow (i.e., today). Dean Dai (Chuanxian) will not be traveling with them, and it is said that he has canceled his trip. However, several people from Shanghai will be traveling together, including Chen Jiayou, a member of the Central Committee, and Hu Han.</p>
<p>Chen Jiayou and Others Departed Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Lin Hanlun, Mr. Hanmin's son-in-law, along with many friends and relatives of Mr. Hu in Shanghai, departed on the Great China Company's President Coolidge at 11:45 a.m. yesterday to go to Hong Kong to greet Mr. Hu. According to Mr. Chen before his departure, speaking to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency on the ship, after Mr. Hu arrives in Hong Kong in a few days, the Guangdong province will have prepared a grand welcome, so Mr. Hu will inevitably return to Guangdong first, and then come north himself, at which time he will return to Shanghai with him. As for the previous rumor that Niu Yongjian, Vice President of the Examination Yuan, was scheduled to take the President Coolidge south yesterday, the reporter searched the ship and found no trace of him. Some said he had rescheduled to take the same ship with Ye Chucang and others this afternoon.</p>
<p>Various Circles in This City Send Telegrams of Welcome</p>
<p>Various circles in this city are organizing a preparatory committee to prepare a welcome for Mr. Hu Zhantang's impending arrival in Beijing to preside over the central government.

<h3>Land Bureau Writes to Banks and Money Shops; Requests That Real Estate Outside Concessions Not Be Discriminated Against; Should Be Included in Cash Reserve; In Order to Work Together to Reverse the Downturn</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Land Bureau believes that when banks and money shops grant cash loans, they only recognize real estate within the concessions as reserve assets and do not give the same treatment to those outside the concessions. Therefore, it sent letters to both the Banking Association and the Money Shop Association to argue for equal treatment. The original letter states: "The Bank Loan Committee has five categories of recognized reserve assets when lending cash. Except for categories B, C, and D, which are not related to real estate, category A lists real estate within the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession. Real estate outside the concessions is not included. Although category E states that 'other assets not within the first four categories, which are approved by the Executive Committee, are considered reserve assets,' in reality, it appears to be discriminatory, requiring Executive Committee approval for real estate outside the concessions but not for those within the concessions. The Money Shop Joint Reserve clearly stipulates that real estate within the city with appraised value may be considered reserve assets. However, it is rumored that it is extremely rare for real estate outside the concessions to be recognized as reserve assets. This situation is extremely detrimental to real estate in Shanghai, because the economic and financial source of Shanghai lies in real estate, and most of the real estate is outside the concessions. Discriminating against real estate outside the concessions is equivalent to drying up its financial source. Furthermore, since the Bureau has been conducting land surveys, it has been making great efforts to rectify and divide the maps clearly. During the survey, it invited neighboring land guards to identify the boundaries, and after the survey, it drew sketches and notified the owners to sign and confirm them. The acreage is accurate, and the boundaries are clear. The procedures for exchanging certificates are also very meticulous. The Bureau checks property right documents, checks food based on the certificate, and checks the certificate based on food. It confirms that they match before allowing the exchange of certificates. Once the certificate is exchanged, the Bureau ensures that it maintains the certainty of the land certificate, leaving no room for doubt or concern. Compared to the land within the concessions, its stability and certainty are not only not inferior but even superior. Therefore, in terms of fact, it does not seem appropriate to discriminate against real estate outside the concessions. Also, there are 2 million residents in the city outside the concessions, and the deposits they have in various banks are not small. The guarantee of these deposits should be real estate outside the concessions. Since the banks have obtained a large amount of deposits from residents in the city outside the concessions, they should help the development of real estate in the city outside the concessions. Moreover, the government is making every effort to rescue the declining economy. It is fair to say that it is protecting the interests of banks and money shops. However, the recovery of this economic decline cannot be achieved without the cooperation of the people. The path to cooperation must be based on exploring the origin and determining the priorities. The economic and financial source of this city lies in real estate, so things that hinder the city's real estate should be improved as soon as possible. Currently, banks and money shops in this city treat real estate inside and outside the concessions differently when lending cash, which is deemed necessary to improve. From the perspective of the Ministry of Finance and the Municipal Government, the entire government's strength is used to protect the interests of banks and money shops, but the banks and money shops discriminate against real estate in the city. This situation is unreasonable. At this time of economic depression, only cooperation can help. In addition to sending letters separately, we hereby request that you investigate and revise the cash lending method to include real estate outside the concessions and that you do not discriminate when implementing the method, so that public friendship can be maintained."</p>
<h3>Oil Mill Trade Association Asks Ministry for Relief</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Oil Mill Trade Association sent a letter to the China General Federation of Industry, which reads: "In reply, we received your letter of December 26 of last year, which opened with a letter from the Ministry of Industry stating, 'Recently, various industries have been experiencing difficulties and have requested relief from the Ministry. The Ministry urgently wants to understand the true situation of the recent actual difficulties and their original requests for various industries.' We hereby forward this to you for your investigation and hope you will forward the results of the discussions by various industry meetings regarding whether there are any recent difficulties and the various industry meetings. The oil mill industry is experiencing difficulties, and the matter is not one-sided. To grasp its importance, it seems that financial blockade, high interest rates, and transportation obstruction and high freight rates are the biggest reasons. We hereby list them in two categories, A and B, and present them to your association in detail. (A) Various industries cannot do without finance as a key element. However, our country currently does not have real industrialists, and for hundreds of years, the business system has been based on credit. Therefore, many people use very little capital to operate very large businesses. This is because they rely on credit loans to circulate funds. Most of our oil mills are suffering from this problem. Although each factory has collected 120,000 to 230,000 yuan in capital, most of it is used to build property and set up machines, so all operating funds must be borrowed, and credit loans are the most important. However, since last summer, the financial sector has suddenly contracted, and the money shops were the first to bear the brunt. They were too busy taking care of themselves to help others. However, what was usually relied upon for circulation cannot be abandoned because of this. However, the difficult situation can be said to have reached its extreme. Interest rates should be fair, but the Shanghai financial sector usually charges an annual interest rate of more than 1% for arrears and pledges, while the interest rate for deposits is only 3 to 4% per month. The difference is too great, and an annual interest rate of more than 1% is unheard of in other countries. (B) The raw materials needed by our industry are mainly soybeans and cottonseed. Soybeans are mainly produced in the three northeastern provinces. There are hundreds of oil mills in that area, and the raw materials are consumed locally. The Japanese government encourages factories to produce, so the cost of the oil cakes produced is relatively low, which allows them to be sold in the interior. Shanghai used to be a sales market for that area. However, after the September 18th Incident, Chinese people were forced by righteous indignation, and in order to block leaks, the factories were successively established. Currently, the soybeans purchased by our industry are mostly produced in Anhui, Shandong, and Henan provinces, followed by Jiangxi and Hubei provinces. However, transporting soybeans from Shangqiu, Henan province, to Shanghai costs 270-280 yuan in national currency for every 20 tons, which is 200 bags, or 400 dan, which is a full train, which is 1.34 yuan per bag. If oil cakes made from them are transported to Guangdong province, then there are Guangdong province tax and additional taxes. With such huge expenses, how can the goods from Shanghai factories compete with the goods from the three northeastern provinces? The same price, they can make a profit, but we cannot even cover the cost. The difficulties are already deep. In addition, the beans from Anhui, Shandong, and Henan provinces are mostly transported by the Longhai and Jinpu Railways, but the railway bureau's vehicles are often lacking, and delays are common. Goods shipped from the place of origin can take as long as one or two months to reach Shanghai. The factory cannot receive them, so there are stoppages and late deliveries. Who is responsible for these unexpected difficulties and various losses? The cottonseed purchased by our industry is mostly produced in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Over the years, supply has been insufficient, and work is often interrupted. Although it is known that Shandong, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces are cotton-producing areas, and there must be many cottonseeds, the freight is too high, even exceeding the value of the cottonseeds. Therefore, the goods from that area cannot be transported to Shanghai. In short, industrial production depends on raw materials. Our country is vast and rich in resources, and it can be traded for what is needed. However, transportation is limited and difficult, and freight rates are higher than in any other country. For example, the cost of transporting rice from Siam, Yangon, and Saigon to Shanghai is only 67 cents per bag, but the cost of transporting rice from one province to another in our country is 1.34 yuan per bag. The difference is more than double, which is shocking. The above two items are the recent difficulties of our industry. As for the relief measures for item A, we propose that the Ministry of Industry transfer to the Ministry of Finance, ordering the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to quickly accept the mortgage of various industries and goods at the lowest interest rate and lend money to ordinary commercial banks and money shops at the lowest interest rate, and order the banks and money shops to reduce the lending interest as much as possible, so that they can still circulate funds among themselves and provide some relief. Otherwise, it is not just our industry that will be difficult to bear, but the entire industrial and commercial sector of the city will be on the verge of collapse. As for item B, we propose that the Ministry of Industry transfer to the Ministry of Railways, requesting that it quickly reduce the freight rates for various native raw materials and order the car affairs offices of the Longhai and Jinpu Railways to increase vehicles, so that passengers and goods can be transported as soon as they arrive, without hindrance, so that goods can flow freely and reduce costs. Then the future of industry will be hopeful. Therefore, we have to make our case to your consideration, and we ask you to submit it to the Ministry of Industry, approving the requested relief measures and ordering them to be implemented quickly. We are very grateful. Sincerely, Shanghai Oil Mill Trade Association.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Highway Engineering Expert, Mr. Coursin, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday; Scheduled to Visit Song Ziwen Today and Tomorrow and Go to Beijing in the Coming Days</h3>
<p>After the former League of Nations Technical Cooperation Liaison Officer, Specialist Haas, returned to Europe, the League of Nations sent another expert in civil engineering, Dr. Leon Coursin, to China to take his place. Mr. Coursin arrived in Shanghai on the French Postal Steamship General Joffre at 3 p.m. yesterday. He is scheduled to visit Mr. Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the Economic Commission, today and tomorrow and will go to Beijing in the coming days. He will stay in China for at least six months. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Mr. Coursin was dispatched in December of last year and departed from Geneva, France, to come to China by ship, taking more than 20 days on the way. He arrived in Shanghai at 3 p.m. yesterday, and the ship docked at the China Merchants Wharf on Broadway Road. Qin Fen, Secretary-General of the National Economic Council, specially sent Guo Dehua, along with League of Nations Resident Representative in China Lou Dandike, water conservancy expert Goodly, and silk expert Dr. Marie's representative, Masingh Quan, to welcome him. After disembarking, Mr. Coursin went to the Duchenne Hotel on Jiangxi Road to rest. Mr. Coursin is of French nationality and has served as the Chief Engineer of Roads and Bridges in France, a civil engineer in the French colonies, and the Director of the Public Works Bureau of French Madagascar.</p>
<p>Mr. Coursin's Remarks</p>
<p>Mr. Coursin has a short beard. When he arrived in Shanghai yesterday, he was wearing a gray casual suit with a black wool overcoat. He is about 40 years old and has a very amiable attitude. According to him, speaking to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency on the ship, this is his second time coming here. The last time he came to China, he only stayed for three months before returning to Europe. This time, he will stay for at least six months and will continue to work in the National Economic Council, assisting in the planning and construction of highways, water conservancy, and other projects. He will travel all over China to inspect, but everything must be decided after consulting with Secretary-General Qin of the Economic Commission. He will stay in Shanghai for two or three days and then go to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Director of Yunnan Construction Department, Zhang Banghan, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday; Scheduled to Return South by Ship This Afternoon</h3>
<p>According to the National News Agency, Zhang Banghan, Director of the Construction Department of Yunnan Province, came to Shanghai and then turned to Beijing last year to attend the Fifth National Congress. After completing his official business, he came to Shanghai to work. Later, as the reorganization of the central government was determined, he stayed in Beijing again to visit President Chiang, asking for instructions on future policies, and met with Xu Mo, Director of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and exchanged views on the Sino-British Yunnan-Burma border survey. He left Beijing for Shanghai the day before yesterday morning. The reporter met Mr. Zhang at his residence yesterday and asked about the recent situation of construction in Yunnan Province and future facilities. He gave a very detailed explanation. The conversation is divided into the following sections:</p>
<p>Yunnan-Burma Border Survey is Underway</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang first said that regarding the Sino-British Yunnan-Burma border survey, the Chinese members, Liang Yugao and Yin Mingde, appointed by the central government, led the technical personnel to arrive at the end of last year. The meeting place for both parties, Husuan, met several times with the members sent by the British side. At the beginning of this year, they set off to the border between the two countries, re-surveyed according to the past signs, and established boundary pillars, so that this long-standing work that has not been resolved for decades and has caused disputes could be completed before the end of March. If this time is exceeded, the climate there is harsh, and it is difficult for those who have not lived there for a long time to stay. As for the survey to be carried out this time, it is limited to the southern section, and it is expected that there will be no problems. Recently, the British have not made any unusual moves in the Ban Hong and Ban Kuang areas. In fact, the natives in the Ban Long area do not show much goodwill towards the British, and even if there are any unusual moves, it will be difficult to make them submit.</p>
<p>Financial Stability and Monetary Unification</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang continued, "Yunnan Province has been the source of the revolution since the Republic of China. The military expenses required for the past campaigns have been huge, and no money has been taken from the people. Instead, paper money has been issued. Therefore, for the past few years, Yunnan Province has almost become a world of paper money, and the value of the currency has plummeted, and the cost of living has increased again. The provincial government has been working hard to maintain this situation. Until recently, it has gradually become stable. Another 35 million yuan of new Fudian banknotes were issued, and at the same time, all previously issued banknotes of 30 million yuan were converted at a rate of five yuan to one yuan of silver. As for the small amount of cash in Yunnan Province, because it contains insufficient silver content, it should actually be used at a rate of two yuan to one yuan of silver that was previously used in Shanghai. Currently circulating in the market, in addition to the new banknotes of 35 million yuan, there are also old banknotes converted at a rate of five yuan to one yuan, about 6 million yuan, and the cash guarantee reserve has reached more than 30 million yuan. Therefore, in terms of finance, it can be said that it is completely stable, and the provincial government is also making every effort to recover all the old banknotes. Therefore, the future of Yunnan's monetary system is quite promising."</p>
<p>Highway Construction Has Achieved Good Results</p>
<p>As for the construction within the province, there have been good results recently. More than 3,000 kilometers of highways have been completed throughout the province, and more than 2,000 kilometers are being measured and will be completed. However, Yunnan Province has always been known for its poverty, and the annual provincial tax revenue is only more than 8 million yuan. All construction is mostly limited by the economy and cannot be carried out. Those in charge often feel that a clever woman cannot cook without rice, but we must not give up because of this. Even in extremely difficult circumstances, we must try our best to do it with a spirit of hard work. Taking the construction of highways as an example, Yunnan Province has always been known as "no three miles of flat ground." Now that we have this achievement, it should also be a manifestation of hard work. He is currently planning to build a large-scale hydroelectric power generation room in Kunming City and to realize the provincial telephone network, etc. It is also learned that Mr. Zhang is scheduled to take the Empress of Canada this afternoon to Hong Kong and then to Yunnan to handle department affairs.</p>
<h3>Northern Navigation Company's Beifu Ran Aground in Anqing; Accident Occurred at 10 a.m. Yesterday; Hired Ships to Unload Cargo to Reduce Load and Tow for Rescue</h3>
<p>The Beifu, a ship of the Northern Navigation Company on Consular Road in the French Concession, with a deadweight of 1,975 tons, a length of 262 feet 2 inches, a width of 35 feet 4 inches, a depth of 20 feet 3 inches, a draft of 17 feet, and two decks, built in 1902, was heading to the Yangtze River with coal. Yesterday (the 14th) at 10 a.m., when the ship reached above Wuhu, near Anqing, the river level dropped sharply, causing it to run aground 10 miles below Anqing. The ship was deeply embedded in the shallow sand. The captain repeatedly reversed, but could not move. The river level is expected to continue to fall. It was not until yesterday afternoon that a telegram was sent to Shanghai for help and instructions. The company received a telegram at 6 p.m. yesterday and immediately decided to urgently telegraph the Anqing branch office, ordering it to hire barges nearby to go to the stranded area and unload all the cargo in the Beifu, so as to reduce the draft and float it on the river surface, and then send another ship to tow it for rescue.</p>
<h3>Japanese Inspection Group Returned Home Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Japanese parliamentary inspection group, led by Nakano and others, arrived in Shanghai on the 10th, entered Beijing on the evening of the 12th, visited President Chiang the next day, and took the night express train out of Beijing that night. They arrived in Shanghai at 7:15 a.m. yesterday. After getting off the train, they went to the Japanese hotel to rest briefly, and then went directly to the Huishan Wharf and boarded the Japanese ship Nagasaki Maru, which set sail for home at 9 a.m. Horiuchi, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in China, and others went to the wharf to see them off.</p>
<h3>Japanese Commander Oikawa Went to Southern China Yesterday to Inspect the Japanese Fleet</h3>
<p>Lieutenant General Oikawa, commander of the Japanese Third Fleet stationed in China, accompanied by his staff officer Mori and his senior aide-de-camp Okamura, departed from Shanghai yesterday morning at 10:00 am aboard the flagship Izumo for an inspection tour of the Southern China area, where the fleet is stationed. The trip is expected to take two weeks. Due to a sudden drop in water levels in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the Shanghai Changjiang Liulun Company is experiencing difficulties with navigation. It is particularly severe above Hankou. After a public resolution, a surcharge for shallow water navigation will be implemented for goods traveling upstream on the Yangtze River. Specifically, goods from Hankou to Changsha will have an additional 10% added to the fixed price starting today. An additional 5% will be added for goods going to Shashi and Yichang, effective from the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>National Products Exhibition to be Held in Southeast Asia, Departure Scheduled for August This Year</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in order to promote the sale of national products and initiate foreign trade, plan to hold a series of national products exhibitions in various ports of Southeast Asia and have petitioned the government to open up shipping routes to Southeast Asia. This has already been approved by the Ministry of Transportation. However, due to the resignation of all directors and supervisors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, immediate progress has been hindered. Preparations for the Southeast Asia National Products Exhibition are currently underway, with a departure scheduled for August of this year. The islands of Southeast Asia are the only outlet for our country's industrial products. In recent years, due to the dumping policies implemented by various countries, our country's market share in Southeast Asia has been almost completely taken over. If we do not catch up quickly, we will have no foothold. In addition, the last Singapore National Products Exhibition sold out all goods and was warmly welcomed by overseas Chinese. The National Federation of Commerce has specially compiled a special issue on the advance of national products into Southeast Asia to facilitate the introduction of all products. It is reported that manufacturers of various national products are preparing a large quantity of goods for an expanded exhibition in the autumn.</p>
<h3>National Products Improvement Association Holds National Exhibition in Guangdong, Petitions the Ministry of Industry for Duty-Free Permits</h3>
<p>The Guangzhou Chinese National Products Exhibition, sponsored by the Chinese National Products Improvement Association of this city, was originally scheduled to open this month. Prior to the opening, an application was made to the Guangdong Provincial Government to obtain duty-free permits. Yesterday, the provincial government replied that the association could directly apply to the Ministry of Industry for the permits. Therefore, the association held a discussion meeting with registered manufacturers at the National Products Factory Federation at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than 30 people attended, chaired by Ma Jisheng. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that the association would directly submit a petition to the Ministry of Industry to issue duty-free permits in accordance with the regulations, in order to transport the goods to Guangzhou for the opening. Once the duty-free permits are obtained, the manufacturers will be notified of the opening date. Half of the booth fees already paid by the manufacturers will be refunded first, and the remainder will be settled when they decide to participate.</p>
<h3>Commissioner of the French Concession Police, Mr. Fabar, Receives Honor</h3>
<p>According to sources from the French Concession Police Department in this city, the French government announced on December 20, 1935, the special award of the Fourth Class Honorary Star to Major Fabar, Commissioner of the Shanghai French Concession Police.</p>
<h3>Telephone Issue Committee Sends Letters to Various Organizations for Unified Resistance, New System Implementation Imminent, Hoping for Final Victory</h3>
<p>The Special District Telephone Issue Committee of this city sent letters to various organizations in this city yesterday, stating: "Regarding the proposed price increase by the Shanghai Telephone Company in the concessions, which has been approved by the Public Concession's Public Works Department and the French Concession's Municipal Council, the new charging system is scheduled to be officially implemented on March 1. Although this committee and various organizations have repeatedly protested and opposed it, it has been ineffective. At a time when all industries are in decline, the company and the two concession authorities have disregarded public interests and stubbornly approved it. The committee, after the first resolution of the board of directors, has sent separate letters to various organizations to inform their members to take the same steps when necessary. As this matter concerns the vital interests of our citizens, we hereby record it in a letter to your association, hoping that you will inform your members to unite in resistance in order to achieve final victory. We respectfully hope you will take note."</p>

<h3>First Special Court Tries Opium Cases, Sentences According to Opium Suppression Regulations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Court, in accordance with the ministry's order, will handle opium cases in accordance with the "Opium Suppression and Drug Prohibition Regulations" promulgated by the Anti-Opium Commissioner. This was originally scheduled to be implemented on the 11th of this month. However, the Public Works Department stated that the police personnel were not yet familiar with the regulations, so by the deadline, all opium cases were still prosecuted by the department based on the "Opium Crime Articles" of the Criminal Law. Guo Yunguan, the president of the First Special Court, now believes that the date of implementation has long been decided and it is impossible to postpone it again. Although the Public Works Department, due to procedural reasons, was unable to immediately use the "Opium Suppression and Drug Prohibition Regulations" for prosecution, the court's trial of these opium cases should not continue to apply the "Opium Crime Articles" that have been explicitly abolished by the government. Therefore, he has ordered the criminal court judges of the court to, from today onwards, sentence all opium cases that have been verified according to the "Opium Suppression and Drug Prohibition Regulations" in order to facilitate opium suppression. Therefore, for the opium cases brought to the court by various police stations of the Public Concession yesterday morning, although the Public Works Department still prosecuted based on the Criminal Law, the presiding judges all declared in court that these types of cases must be dealt with in accordance with the newly promulgated regulations. In order to be cautious in sentencing, the court has also, from yesterday onwards, appointed defense lawyers for opium defendants who have not appointed lawyers to defend them.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Writes to Jianghai Customs to Suspend the Sale of Jadeite Boulders</h3>
<p>The case has now been filed for administrative litigation in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Sale will result in irreparable damage. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Commissioner of Jianghai Customs yesterday, stating: "On the 13th of this month, we received a letter from merchant Chen Kaiqing, stating that a jadeite boulder that had been taxed and fined by Jianghai Customs was taken back and detained. Subsequently, the customs imposed various penalties, including fines, confiscation, and supplementary taxes. An objection was immediately raised, and the Customs Administration decided to maintain the original decision of the customs, and an administrative lawsuit has been filed. According to the decision, the first penalty was due to underreporting the value of the goods, and the second penalty was due to submitting a forged document. This is completely wrong. The first penalty was due to the mistaken identification of the invoice and tax bill as forged. (The invoice stated the value of the goods as 825 rupees, and the tax bill stated the tax amount as 200 rupees. Calculating based on the low tax rate in that area, it should be 600 rupees, which the customs did not believe and arbitrarily set it as 2,000 rupees.) Therefore, the submission of a forged document is the reason for the first penalty. The second penalty is still for the same reason, which is clearly punishing the same crime twice. The penalty at that time was already inappropriate, and now it is even more unbearable. This case is currently in litigation, but today we received a letter from the customs stating that the fine imposed should be paid immediately. If you want to buy back the jadeite boulder, you must prepare the price and come immediately and pay the supplementary tax, otherwise it will be sold for public benefit. Executing the disposal means that the value of the jadeite boulder can only be determined after it has been cut and polished. It is speculative in nature and is different from ordinary goods. Once it is auctioned, it cannot be restored to its original state. We have already contacted the customs to stop the execution. We are sincerely afraid that we will not be able to obtain approval. We intend to ask your chamber to uphold justice, provide assistance, and request that no arbitrary execution be carried out. We are deeply grateful.</p>
<h3>Continued Trial of the Dispute Between the Continental Bank, Two or Three Money Exchanges, and Treasury Bill Contracts</h3>
<p>The financial community attaches great importance to this case and many people attended the court to listen.</p>
<p>The judge questioned both parties and advised them to reconcile, and pay the supplementary tax, otherwise it would be sold for public benefit. The execution of the disposal. It must be cut and polished to determine its true value; this is highly speculative, making it different from ordinary goods. Once executed and auctioned, it can never be restored. In addition to asking the customs to suspend the execution, we fear that it will be difficult to gain approval. We respectfully ask your esteemed chamber to uphold justice, provide assistance, and ensure that no arbitrary execution is carried out. We would be eternally grateful." Upon arrival at the chamber, it was noted that Chen Kaiqing had, after the objection was decided, filed an administrative lawsuit according to law to seek final redress. As this case has not been decided by the administrative court, it cannot be considered finalized. If it were to be executed directly, the owner of the goods would suffer irreparable damage. Therefore, Article 9 of the Administrative Litigation Law also stipulates that the original authority may, ex officio or at the request of the plaintiff, suspend the execution. Accordingly, we request that your esteemed commissioner of customs temporarily suspend the execution of this case until it has been adjudicated by the administrative court.</p>
<h3>Lilli Motor Company Declares Bankruptcy Yesterday</h3>
<p>Unable to withstand soaring gasoline prices and intense competition.</p>
<p>The manager has fled, and workers are gathering to demand back wages. Xin Sheng News Agency reports that Lilli Hekiji Motor Co., Ltd., affected by the economic downturn and facing rising gasoline prices and intense competition, has suffered excessive losses and is unable to continue operating. The company declared bankruptcy yesterday, and the manager has fled. One hundred and fifty drivers, coppersmiths, and workers gathered at the company to jointly demand back wages. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for Losses: Lilli Hekiji General Company, located at 329 North Suzhou Road, was established jointly by Li Song General Company and others. It has been in operation for many years. The company had seven telephone stations in the concessions: Songquan, Gude Guang, Fulu, Beikai'er Road, Sapo Sai Road, Jielu, Sichuan Road, and Shanzhong Road. The telephone numbers were "16200" in the concessions and "23232" in the Southern City. The company originally had 80 vehicles, mostly covered wagons. Since being affected by the economic downturn and facing intense competition, the manager and shareholder Li Songquan tried to maintain the company by reducing the taxi fare from two dimes to eight cents. However, this faced opposition and was appealed to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, which ruled that it could not be implemented.</p>
<p>Temporary Shutdown: Now, with the rising gasoline prices, the company closed three branch stations on Jie Road and Shanzhong Road. It scrapped 20 of the 80 old and dilapidated vehicles and tried to tighten its belt to maintain the status quo. It also offered single deliveries for one yuan, exempting the usual two-dime tip, in an attempt to make a final stand. However, the business continued to be affected by the economic downturn, making it impossible to sustain. The company suddenly announced its closure yesterday. The company's vehicles were parked at the general company on North Suzhou Road and at various branch stations. A public notice reading "Temporarily Closed" was posted at the entrance of the general company.</p>
<p>Workers Demand Back Wages: The company's drivers, coppersmiths, and workers, totaling about 150, gathered at the general company yesterday to inquire about the situation after the company closed. A Xin Sheng News Agency reporter visited the general company yesterday afternoon and learned that the manager, Li Songquan, was still at the company. According to reports, the company owed the workers three months' wages. The reporter also learned from reliable sources that the company's debts were not significant, and the amount owed was roughly the same as the amount it was owed. Therefore, it is said that the company will be formally liquidated.</p>
<h3>National Trade Bureau Introduces Domestic Products</h3>
<p>According to the National Trade Bureau yesterday, the bureau has recently received many letters from abroad requesting domestic products. The following is a list of them, and various manufacturers and exporters are requested to contact the bureau's guidance department for introductions: The Puleton Chemical Company of the United States requests information on soybean trading companies for direct procurement. Eastman Company of India requests an introduction to reputable exporters and manufacturers dealing in stationery, flashlights, batteries, antiques, jewelry, cutlery, novelties, and groceries for trading purposes. Commercial credit can be inquired at the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Central Bank of India in Mumbai. Martin Company of Spain needs horsehair, pig bristles, and plant fibers that can be used to make brush belts, and requests that the bureau introduce them to various exporters to save time. The West India Company of the British West Indies is willing to manage rubber-soled shoes, jute, cotton fabrics, handkerchiefs, embroidered silk shirts, towels, sheets, cotton linen, pillowcases, bed sheets, tablecloths, silk cotton god clothing slippers, food, cosmetics, rare and exotic goods, pearls, earrings, porcelain, glassware, shawls, etc. A certain import and export company in the UK needs small walnut kernels.</p>
<h3>Inland Navigation Association Asks for Release of Yuanxiang Ship</h3>
<p>Special telegram to Huzhou Security Command</p>
<p>The criminals have been apprehended, and there is no need to detain the ship.</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that the Yuanxiang ship of the Yuantong Shipping General Bureau, which operates on the Shenhu line at North Suzhou Road, was detained for smuggling opium in Nanxun. The crew members, including Cai Atu, were also detained by the local county government. In addition to sending the Yuanyu ship as a replacement, the bureau also sent a letter to the Inland Navigation Association, requesting it to ask the authorities to release the ship. The relevant information was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the Inland Navigation Association, after receiving the letter, sent a special telegram to the Huzhou Security Command, requesting it to consider the difficulties of the merchants and release the detained Yuanxiang ship. The telegram reads: "To the Huzhou Security Command: According to a letter from member Yuantong Shipping General Bureau (the letter is omitted), the association previously reported to the Zhejiang provincial shipping merchants that the Zhejiang province had established strict rules on prohibiting shipping employees from transporting and smoking opium, fearing that shipping merchants would be subject to unjust imprisonment. The association specially submitted a request to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Department of Civil Affairs, asking them to strictly order the county governments and the naval and land forces to protect the legitimate rights of shipping merchants when investigating opium smuggling and not to arbitrarily detain ships. Zhejiang Department of Civil Affairs No. 1972 approved the request to be forwarded to the subordinate authorities for compliance. This shows the government's utmost intention to protect the shipping industry. In this case, the Yuanxiang ship crew members Cai Atu and others dared to privately carry opium when the government was strictly prohibiting opium, which is extremely illegal. We have already given a warning, but the Yuanxiang ship is a scheduled ship on the Shenhu route, which concerns transportation and should not be detained for a long time. Now that the criminals have been apprehended, there is no need to detain the ship. Please, Your Excellency, consider the difficulties of the merchants and approve the release of the ship. Shanghai Inland River Steamer Shipping Association Chairman Han Yimin."</p>
<h3>Altering Lottery Tickets to Claim Rewards, Attempt to Deceive Discovered</h3>
<p>Cao Chunsheng Detained Awaiting Sentencing</p>
<p>Cao Chunsheng, a 17-year-old worker at the Meiwen Printing House at 622 Nanjing Road, bought a one-yuan "Overseas" lottery ticket from the Fulai Lottery Shop at 623 Nanjing Road, across from the printing house, for the 18th Aviation Highway Construction Lottery. The last digit of the lottery number Cao bought was the same as the last digit of the first prize number. According to the rules, he could redeem a one-yuan prize. However, Cao had a fanciful idea and found a discarded lottery ticket. He cut off the seven Chinese and Western characters in the number and pasted them onto the "Hundred Changes Four" characters on the number of the lottery ticket he bought, changing it to 234775, which happened to be the same as the sixth prize number drawn in this period. At 11:00 AM on the 13th, Cao held the lottery ticket and redeemed the 10-yuan sixth prize at the Dachangcheng Tobacco and Paper Shop, which also sold aviation tickets, at 120 Xin Kaihe Road, Huangpu Beach, French Concession. He was discovered by Gao Zengshi, the shop owner from Ningbo, who immediately called Detective Yao Zhupo and a patrol officer to arrest Cao. Cao was detained and taken to the police station along with the altered lottery ticket. Yesterday morning, Cao was detained and taken to the police station along with the altered lottery ticket. Yesterday, the court stated the facts of the case, stating that the defendant was detained for altering valuable securities with the intention of defrauding money. The police station still needs to conduct a detailed investigation and requested a one-week extension to investigate the case. Then, Detective Yao Zhupo reported the circumstances of the arrest and submitted the altered lottery ticket to the court. According to the witness Gao Zengsai's statement, the defendant fraudulently redeemed the reward with the altered ticket. Cao Chunsheng admitted to cutting and pasting the ticket. After verifying the confession, Judge Wang Gangxu ordered that the trial be rescheduled to 21st. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Peddling Altered Aviation Lottery Tickets, Lu Yuelian Sentenced to Three Years</h3>
<p>Lu Yuelian, from Huzhou, recently secretly peddled various expired aviation lottery tickets that had been altered to resemble the 18th period, as well as American Tianjin Relief Champagne tickets, at the Youxing Teahouse at 827 North Chengdu Road and other places, to profit. This was discovered by Chinese Detective Pan Yunlong of the Yulin Road Police Station. At around 10:00 AM on the 3rd of this month, he secretly went with a Western detective to arrest Lu, seizing 15 altered 18th-period aviation tickets, 50 unaltered tickets, 175 American Tianjin Champagne tickets, and an 18th-period woodblock and dozens of Da Yun Company aviation ticket envelopes at his home at 113 Datong Road. He was taken to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention along with the suspect Luo Xinfa from Ningbo. As reported in this newspaper, yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefei continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Labor Bureau lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that during the alteration, three Fujian-Guangdong highway lottery tickets were also seized at Lu Yuelian's home. It was found that the lottery tickets were completely fabricated and did not exist. He immediately submitted this information for inspection. Luo Xinfa was found to be unrelated. Lu confessed that he had privately sold various lottery tickets for only five days, earning very little money. He did this as a last resort because he was unemployed and hungry, seeking leniency. Judge Xiao sentenced Lu Yuelian to three years of imprisonment, and the evidence was confiscated. Luo Xinfa was acquitted.</p>
<h3>Notorious Bandit Zhang Xibiao Apprehended</h3>
<p>He once shot a French policeman and committed kidnapping.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhongming, also known as Zhang Xibiao, from Shaoxing, committed a major crime in the French Concession in December of the previous year by opening fire and resisting arrest, injuring a French police officer. Due to the intensive pursuit by the police, Zhang went into hiding and was never caught. Until the day before yesterday, Lu Liankui, the Chinese Inspector-General of the Public Concession Police General Inspectorate, learned of Zhang's hiding place. He led Chinese Detectives Liu Shaokui and Feng Zhiming to 30 Nanyongxiang, 800 Hambury Road, Hongkou, at 12:15 PM the day before yesterday and arrested Zhang, taking him back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was taken to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the previous situation and requested that Zhang be detained because the case was still under investigation. Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court, questioned Zhang briefly and ordered that he be detained for one week for further questioning. It is reported that Zhang also committed kidnapping and other cases in the Public Concession, and the police are conducting a thorough investigation in preparation for filing a lawsuit with the First Special Court.</p>
<h3>Woman Stabbed to Death by Robbers, Her Scream for Help Sealed Her Fate</h3>
<p>Wang Maotang, a 36-year-old man from Haimen who lived at 41 Dexingli, Peng Road, sold vegetables for a living at a Japanese establishment. The night before last, he and his wife, Mrs. Chen (39 years old), went to his brother's house on Dulu'an Road to play mahjong. They returned home together at around 1:00 AM yesterday morning. As they were about to enter their backyard entrance, three robbers suddenly appeared. One of them, armed with a handgun, searched Wang and stole 28 yuan in cash. Another robber forced Chen to hand over her money. Chen, terrified, shouted for help, and the robber pulled out a sharp knife and stabbed her violently in the neck. She immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. As she tried to shout again, she was stabbed several more times. The robbers, seeing what they had done, fled in all directions. Chinese officers 3377 and 2029 arrived after hearing the alarm and reported the incident to the Hongkou Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate the scene. An ambulance was sent to the scene and rushed Chen to the Shanghai Tuberculosis Hospital, but she died shortly after. The body was taken to the Fei Lun Road morgue. At around 10:00 AM, Tang, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Court, together with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. After Chinese officer Yin Xingsheng stated the facts of the case, Tang ordered that it be determined that the deceased, Wang Chen, a female, was stabbed to death by robbers. The body was handed over to her husband, Wang Maotang, to claim and bury. The accomplices in this case are at large, and the police station should strictly investigate the case and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Kanghua Silk Factory Owner Lu Rukang Attacked</h3>
<p>Two Assassins Fled the Scene</p>
<p>Seriously Injured in Vital Areas</p>
<p>Lu Rukang, a local man of 40 years of age, residing at 5 Shunxingli, Qingyun Road, Zhabei, is in the artificial silk business and owns the Kanghua Silk Factory on Qingyun Road, Zhabei. Unexpectedly, at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, just as Lu got up to wash, two assassins suddenly arrived, each carrying a handgun, and broke into the inner room through the back door. Upon seeing Lu Rukang, they immediately opened fire at him without asking questions, firing three shots. One shot hit his left shoulder, one hit his head, and one shot missed. Lu was caught off guard and immediately fell to the ground in pain, lying in a pool of blood. Seeing that they had achieved their goal, the two assassins immediately ran out the door and fled without a trace. By the time family members and beat police arrived after hearing the sound, the perpetrators had already fled far away. They immediately reported the incident to the Xibaoxing Road branch police station, which dispatched police to search for the perpetrators. Lu was rushed to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but due to the severity of the injuries in vital areas, his condition is very critical. As for the identity of the perpetrators, it is said that it may have been caused by a grudge. The police are currently conducting a secret investigation.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's recent currency reform has stopped the use of coins and stipulated that the banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications are the legal tender. Other banks with the right to issue banknotes were ordered to stop issuing them as of November 3 of the previous year. However, the Continental Bank took this as a pretext to cancel the contracts it had signed with Huafeng and 12 other banks, totaling 1.75 million yuan, to use the Central Bank's banknotes. The banks unanimously opposed this, arguing that the contracts had not yet expired, and retained lawyer Zhan Jifeng to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court against the Continental Bank and its president, Ye Fuchi, to confirm</p>
<p>The contract is valid and to pay the annual interest on the 40% cash deposit. After the court held a hearing, the Continental Bank also retained lawyer Wang Chuanbi to file a statement of defense. The plaintiff then filed a statement refuting the defendant's arguments point by point. The details have been reported in detail in the newspaper. However, there are many money exchanges in this city that promote famous bank notes, which are so-called "designated banknotes," so this case is considered to have</p>
<p>Serious implications for those who use these notes, and should not be ignored. Therefore, when Judge Huang Dahee continued the trial in the 13th Court at 1:30 PM yesterday, in addition to the representatives of the plaintiff banks, Ma Wenxiang, Liu Ximeng, Yin Huanzhi, and others, more than 40 or 50 people from the financial community attended the hearing. The spectator seats were packed. Judge Huang asked the plaintiff's lawyer about the interest calculation, since the plaintiff requested a judgment on confirming the validity of the contract and paying interest. Lawyer Zhan said that the amount of notes used by each plaintiff</p>
<p>Varies. The interest should be calculated according to the contract based on the amount of security deposited. Please judge that the defendant should pay the full amount from January 1, 24 to the end of the year. The defendant should have no dispute over this fact. The defendant's lawyer Wang Chuanbi then stated that the defendant had not calculated the interest, and the defendant argued that the contract should be terminated. The court then turned to the defendant's lawyer and asked, "The Ministry of Finance has not stopped the circulation of notes that have already been issued."</p>
<p>The defendant's lawyer replied, "The Ministry of Finance's order limited it to November 3 and stated that no more notes could be issued, so the defendant argues that the contract should be terminated." The judge continued to ask, "The point of contention in this case is not the issuance problem. Now, let me ask if the plaintiff has demanded that the defendant continue to issue notes because they have not used up the full amount according to the contract." The lawyer replied, "There is no such situation, and we no longer need to promote sales." The judge asked, "So the notes that have already been sold are still in circulation, and the defendant has not recalled them." The lawyer replied, "That is correct." The judge then raised the issue of the contract signed between the Bank of Communications and the note users,</p>
<p>Which is still valid, and asked the defendant's lawyer about it. The lawyer said that the situations were different and could not be compared. Then lawyer Zhan presented two pages of the notification from the Yanyeh Bank to the note users of the bank regarding interest payments, and stated that the Yanyeh Bank and the Continental Bank are both members of the Four Banks, and their steps should be consistent with regard to note usage. Now that the Yanyeh Bank continues to fulfill the note usage contract and still pays interest according to the contract, why does the Continental Bank want to be different? The defendant's lawyer also</p>
<p>Produced a stack of canceled note usage contracts, saying that the defendant had canceled many contracts with other companies, and they were presented for reference. The plaintiff's lawyer immediately refuted this, saying that some of the canceled contracts had expired, or the term was about to expire, or a special benefit was given before they were canceled, and this could not be used to bind this case. Since Judge Huang believed that the case still needed investigation, he ordered the plaintiff to prepare a detailed interest calculation table and submit it, rescheduling the hearing to the afternoon of February 5 and expressing his hope that the parties would resolve it peacefully outside the court. The lawyers of both parties respected the court's good intentions and withdrew.</p>

<h3>Russian Immigrants Concerned: Bakery Homicide Case</h3>
<p>The shop owner stabbed his employee to death in a fit of anger; the original sentence was deemed too harsh, leading to an appeal.  Bai Liqiang, the 48-year-old Russian owner of a bakery and confectionery shop located at 2346 Avenue D'Ambel in the French Concession, employed a 30-year-old Russian named Sai Miyanuofu. Bai's wife, Bai Qilianzi, informed him that Sai had repeatedly engaged in inappropriate and lewd behavior towards their daughters, Lala and Weiwo Laide, aged nine and five respectively. On the afternoon of November 26th of the previous year, Bai summoned Sai to a small room on the third floor of the shop. He questioned and rebuked Sai, who admitted to the accusations and acted aggressively, which inflamed Bai. Overcome with anger, Bai grabbed a knife</p>
<p>and killed Sai. Afterwards, Bai surrendered himself to the French Concession police. The police department transferred Bai to the Special District Second Court, charging him with homicide under Article 271 of the Criminal Code. After a trial presided over by Judge Zhang Chaozuo, Bai Liqiang was sentenced to twelve years imprisonment on December 7th. Dissatisfied with the heavy sentence, the defendant, Bai, hired attorneys Zhan Jifeng, Zhu Gaorong, and the French lawyer Puleimei, who submitted a petition to the High Court Third Branch, citing reasons for appeal. After the verdict of the Special District Second Court was issued, various Western newspapers in Shanghai</p>
<p>published editorials, arguing that the defendant killed a rogue element in a fit of anger and then surrendered himself. They believed the sentence was too severe and cited Western laws that could exempt the defendant from punishment under such circumstances. Consequently, the French Concession Police Department, in accordance with Article 336, Section 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law, also filed an appeal with the High Court Third Branch for the defendant's benefit, requesting the original verdict be overturned and a lighter sentence imposed. Based on the petition, the High Court Third Branch, led by Acting Chief Judge Sun Honglin, along with Judges Wang Yue and Li Changnian, convened a joint session with Chief Prosecutor Zhao Shibei yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. to hear the case.</p>
<p>The French Concession Police Department was represented by attorney Fei Xizhen. The attorneys hired by the appellant Bai Liqiang, Zhan, Zhu, and Pu, also arrived on time. This case garnered considerable attention from Westerners in Shanghai, with over a hundred Russian men, women, and children crowding the gallery. All seats were filled, and numerous reporters from various Western newspapers in Shanghai, more than ten in total, attended to observe and record the proceedings. After the court was called to order, the court ordered Bai Liqiang to be brought before the court. His age and occupation were verified, and his testimony was interpreted by translator Zhang Qingchun. After the testimony, the Police Department attorney presented the</p>
<p>reasons for the appeal. Afterwards, the court questioned Bai Liqiang about his reasons for appealing. According to the translated testimony, he was appealing because the original sentence of twelve years was too harsh, and the detailed reasons would be presented by his representatives. The court ordered him to also provide a detailed account, as his representatives were only there to defend him. Bai testified that Sai Miyanuofu had behaved indecently towards his two daughters, which he was initially unaware of. On November 26th, his wife suddenly</p>
<p>called him to stop Sai Miyanuofu. He pressed her for the reason, and she was initially unwilling to say. After repeated questioning, his wife revealed that the older daughter had told her mother that Sai Miyanuofu had been engaging in improper behavior towards the two girls. He summoned Sai to a small room upstairs where flour was stored and questioned him. Sai directly admitted it, saying he was just playing around and that it was no big deal. He was extremely agitated and tried to hit Sai but couldn't find anything to use as a weapon. He saw a sharp knife on a flour sack and used it to strike Sai. Sai immediately rushed at him. He didn't know how</p>
<p>Sai was fatally injured. His mind was confused, he didn't understand, and he didn't know how he surrendered himself to the police. The court then summoned Bai's wife and daughter, along with the Western detective from the police station who handled the case, for detailed and repeated questioning. The process took a considerable amount of time before it was completed. The court then ordered the start of the arguments. The Chief Prosecutor delivered his opinion, followed by arguments between the Police Department attorney and Bai's three attorneys, mainly requesting a lighter sentence or probation. After the arguments were completed, the court announced the end of the arguments and scheduled the verdict for 2 p.m. on the 21st. The appellant, Bai Liqiang, was remanded to custody pending the verdict. By the time the court adjourned, the clock had struck seven.</p>

<p>Concluding arguments; sentencing scheduled. Regarding the robbery at the home of Huangbao car puller Zhang Guokang at No. 23, Lane 1229, No. 1229 Zhongxing Road, Zhabei around 11 PM on November 5th of last year, where Tang Shangjin, a police officer from the Zhongxing Road Police Station of the Xinzha Sub-bureau who went to make an arrest, was shot in the chest and died on the spot – an incident previously reported in the newspapers – it is now known that the case was investigated by Yang Yucai, a detective from the Xinzha Detective Team,</p>
<p>Mine Industry Association Announces</p>
<p>National Mining Overview and that the thief Zhou Chang’an was apprehended. After being transported to the Shanghai Local Court, Prosecutor Xiao Jinying repeatedly held court hearings and considered the case should be prosecuted.  On January 8th of this year at 1 PM, Judge Wu Yingbao opened the Third Tribunal, summoning the victim Zhang Guokang, Hao Likai, the chief of the Zhongxing Road Police Station, Zhuang Jingzao, as well as the Zhou offender.  He also summoned Detective Zhong Da, who handled the case of the stabbing death of concubine Wang Huizhen on May 21st of the previous year at around 11 PM, and the police chief of the Tangjiaqiao Police Station, etc., for an open trial.  Judge Wu determined that witnesses still needed to be summoned regarding the robbery and murder of police officer Tang Shangjin at Zhang Guokang's home, so yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, Zhang Guokang, a large creditor who pulls a rickshaw, and Detective Yang Yucai, who handled the case, were again summoned to the Third Tribunal for questioning.  Zhou Chang'an, however, directly admitted to stabbing his concubine Wang Huizhen. As for the reasons for the stabbing, he claimed, "In May of last year, I asked Wang Huizhen to send my father home. My father suddenly disappeared, and Wang also had other lovers," etc. He denied the shooting of the police officer. However, after the victim Zhang Guokang and the large creditor testified, Judge Wu appointed volunteer lawyer Ding Xudong to defend him.  The judge then declared the closing arguments concluded and ordered the defendant Zhou Chang'an returned to custody to await sentencing on a scheduled date.</p>

<h3>Land Bureau Reduces Land Transfer Tax</h3>
<p>The Land Bureau has been collecting transfer taxes according to the regulations of 8.4% of sales prices, without any increase. After dividing the area for collecting land value tax and changing to collect land value tax, the transfer tax was reduced by 2%. It is now learned that the Land Bureau has separately drafted a method to further reduce the transfer tax, which has been submitted to the Municipal Government by the Finance and Land Bureaus. Upon approval, a public notice will be jointly issued to inform the public. The public notice is extracted below:</p>
<p>According to the regulations, the amount of deed tax to be levied on land sales in the city has been previously stipulated as 6 yuan per 100 yuan of deed price for sales deeds, plus an additional construction special levy of 2 yuan per 100 yuan. For pawn deeds, it is 3 yuan per 100 yuan of deed price, plus an additional construction special levy of 1 yuan per 100 yuan. For those within the land value tax collection area, it is reduced to 2 yuan per 100 yuan, which has been followed. However, it has been found that after private land sales are concluded, they are often concealed from taxation and title transfer. Most landowners inherit the land and pay the grain tax, causing the owner's name to lose its accuracy, which hinders land consolidation. However, the financial capacity of the people has been affected by the sluggish market, making it inevitable that they cannot pay taxes according to regulations. Previously, this bureau drafted a method to reduce taxes for old deeds that have exceeded the time limit for tax payment, which was submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and announced for implementation. Now, although the taxes on old deeds that have exceeded the time limit have been reduced, the current deed tax rate should also be reduced to alleviate the people's financial burden. A method has been drafted and tentatively implemented for one year to observe the effects. It has been submitted to the Municipal Government, which has approved the trial implementation. In addition to amending and reporting the "Provisional Rules for Collecting Real Estate Deed Tax in this City," the method for reducing the transfer tax is attached below. All landowners in the city are hereby notified that in the future, if there is a land transfer, they must comply with the tax payment and not betray the intent of sympathy and tax reduction. This special announcement is made, as follows: Method for reducing land transfer tax: For land located in plots where permanent leases can be established and which have obtained land practice certificates, a 1% transfer tax will be levied upon sale and transfer. For land that has not been announced for certificate exchange, the transfer tax will be changed to 4% uniformly. For land holding land practice certificates and not conforming to the first item, if the land is located within the area for collecting provisional land value tax, the transfer tax will be changed to 1%. If the land is not located within the land value tax collection area, the transfer tax will be changed to 4%. For land located in areas where land practice certificates have not yet been developed and not conforming to the first item, a 4% transfer tax will be levied. January, 25th year of the Republic of China. Cai Zengji, Director of the Finance Bureau and concurrently Acting Director of the Land Bureau.</p>

After consulting with Finance Minister Kong on the liquidation method, the general assembly will make a decision.

This matter still needs to be referred to the government authorities for personnel to handle it together in order to show prudence. Furthermore, according to the New Voice News Agency reporter's investigation, the entire committee of the Relief Association believes that the actions of this wife should be commended for future generations and plans to build a memorial hall in Suzhou afterwards to promote benevolence.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Stamp Tax Method for Rent Books</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a notice yesterday stating: "To whom it may concern, regarding the matter of how to affix stamps to the rent book issued by the Public Security Bureau, this association has repeatedly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for approval. Now, we have received approval No. Shui Zi 8353 stating that the first page of the rent book submitted by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau contains the lease agreement. If the tenant fills in the location and rent of the rented house in this agreement and signs or affixes a seal, regardless of whether there is another lease, it has already taken effect and the tenant who made the lease should affix a two-cent stamp according to law. The rent receipts attached to the rent book must be issued to the tenant one by one and are of the nature of money receipts, so the landlord should affix a stamp according to law each time this receipt is issued. However, in ordinary rent books, although there is a lease on the first page, the monthly rent is collected based on this rent book and no separate rent receipt is given. Therefore, this rent book is a certificate with more than two natures. According to Article 8 of the Stamp Tax Law, if the same certificate has more than two natures and the tax rates are different, the higher tax rate should be applied. The landlord should affix stamps according to the regulations in item 4 of the tax rate table for account books, and the tenant does not need to affix any more stamps on the first page. Please be informed, etc." With this, the corresponding letter is sent for your information and compliance.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Association Petitions for Rescue of Lu Deguang and Others</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau Establishes Overseas Chinese Inquiry Office</h3>
<p>Handling guidance, answering questions, and consulting matters. The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau has consulted with customs authorities several times last year, intending to set up an Overseas Chinese Inquiry Office inside the Jianghai Customs Wharf to handle guidance of overseas Chinese work and answer inquiries from returning overseas Chinese. Its intention was excellent, but it could not be realized because there was no space available in the customs house to set up the inquiry office. According to Mr. Jian Jinglun, the director of the bureau, the bureau realized that overseas Chinese have been away from their homeland for a long time, and once they return, they often have little knowledge of the situation in their motherland. Moreover, Shanghai is a place where people from all over the world gather, and the situation is complicated, so there are possibilities for being cheated. Therefore, at the beginning of the bureau's establishment, it contacted the customs authorities repeatedly, requesting permission to set up an Overseas Chinese Inquiry Office in the customs house to prepare for inquiries from overseas Chinese and to send personnel to be stationed there on a regular basis to provide guidance. However, due to location constraints, it was impossible to cede land, and the establishment had to be temporarily suspended. Now, observing the situation from all sides, it seems that there is no room for further delay, so it is proposed to attach the inquiry office to the bureau first, and then expand the organization after a suitable location is found, so that overseas Chinese returning to the country will know where to inquire.</p>

<h3>Mine Industry Association Announces National Mining Overview</h3>
<p>The National News Agency reports that the China Mine Industry Federation believes that the country's mining industry is prosperous, but statistics are still lacking.

It printed a large "Simplified Table of Domestic Mining Overview for the 23rd Year" in December of last year, which has now been printed. This is an innovation in the mining industry. The association is already working on the 24th year's version and will be able to publish it in the second half of the year. The simplified statistics table is recorded below:</p>

<h3>Zhegan Railway Opens Today</h3>
<p>The image shows the Guixi Bridge of the Zhegan Railway, photographed during a test run on the 9th of this month. The bridge is over 1,300 feet long, divided into thirteen spans, each spanning 100 feet, with a total construction cost of 800,000 yuan. It was contracted by Mr. Tao Guilin of the Fuyiji Construction Factory, a famous architect in Shanghai. The engineers responsible for supervision were Peng Qi, Cui Erfeng, and Zhou Yuhong. Construction began in November of the 23rd year of the Republic of China and was completed in December of the 24th year of the Republic of China. The project suffered repeated floods, resulting in unrecoverable losses, and in June of the 24th year, it suffered the worst flood in sixty years, resulting in significant losses. The difficulties of inconvenient transportation, difficult transportation, and rapid water flow made construction difficult. It is said that the actual work on the bridge took less than six months to complete, which can be described as swift. During the test run on the 9th, nineteen trailers were used, and the results were very satisfactory. The entire railway will hold an opening ceremony in Nanchang today.</p>

<h3>Grand Hotel Homicide Case: Court Opens Trial</h3>
<p>Defendants Five Ordered to Provide Solid Shop Guarantees</p>
<p>On December 31st of last year, Wang Lu and other workers from a certain newspaper rented Room 332 at the Grand Hotel on East Xinqiao Road to celebrate the New Year holiday. Unexpectedly, around 1:00 AM, two women suddenly appeared, claiming to be looking for someone named Zhang. Wang replied that there was no Zhang there. The two women immediately left, but within minutes, they returned with more than ten hooligans, all dressed in blue short shirts and trousers. They forcibly accused Wang and Lu of being lewd, and without asking questions, they attacked, injuring Wang's head. Lu's left eye was also punched and swollen. It was said that the internal injuries were very serious. The hotel tea boy, hearing the noise, rushed to mediate but was also beaten. Seeing their objective achieved, the thugs fled in all directions. The tea boy, Yang Jusheng, only managed to apprehend Zhao Wenjun, Wang Aliu, Zhang Genfa, Jiang Asan, and Shen Changsheng. He reported to the police, who charged them with assault and battery in the Second Special District Court. The trial opened yesterday morning at 9:00 AM in the court's eighth criminal division, presided over by Judge Sun Pengxian. First, the first plaintiff, Wang, testified that he was beaten and injured and that he did not know the defendants. He believed that they were incited by someone behind the scenes and requested an investigation. Later, the hotel tea boy stated that the defendants originally wanted to rent Room 306 (next door to Room 332), but because they looked like hooligans, the tea boy refused. As a result, they rented Room 326 at the south of the Grand Hotel. This clearly shows that the incident was premeditated. The second plaintiff, Lu, hired lawyer Yao Junyu to represent him. Yao stated that Lu was unable to attend court due to his injuries. When questioned, the defendants Zhao Wenjun, Wang Aliu, Zhang Genfa, Jiang Asan, and Shen Changsheng gave evasive answers. Lawyer Yao Junyu requested severe punishment. Judge Sun Pengxian ordered the five defendants, Zhao Wenjun, to provide solid shop guarantees. They were detained without bail, and the hearing was adjourned for two weeks.</p>
<h3>Teasing Women Leads to Death by Falling</h3>
<p>Zhang Daowen, a man from Yangzhou in his late thirties, went to 107 Laowende Lane at the intersection of Pingliang Road and Ningguo Road in East Shanghai yesterday. Zhang worked at the Tongxing Cotton Mill at the intersection of Guangxin Road in Yangshupu. Although Zhang was in his forties, he was naturally frivolous. He would tease any woman who passed his door, and the neighbors knew of his bad nature but did not bother to argue with him. Yesterday afternoon, around 2:00 PM, Zhang was working on the second floor of the Tongxing Mill when he suddenly caught sight of a young woman walking below. Zhang's heart was stirred, and he thought it was an opportunity not to be missed. He rushed to the window, leaned out, and began to tease the woman. While he was excitedly enjoying himself, he lost his balance and fell headfirst from the window, his head hitting the ground, and his brains splattering. By the time the mill's staff arrived, Zhang was already dying. He was immediately taken to the hospital by car but died soon after. His body was then sent to the morgue to await a court examination.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Seasoning Powder Industry: Editor of China Credit Letter</h3>
<p>(Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce, Part 9)</p>
<p>I. Origin</p>
<p>Seasoning powder is a newly emerging chemical product that has only recently been added to the human diet. This is because after the German scientist Liedharson invented the extraction of sodium glutamate from grains, Dr. Ikeda of Japan discovered that it could be used to make seasoning powder. The method of manufacturing this powder is to first extract gluten from flour, combine it with hydrochloric acid, alcohol, and other substances, and then grind it into powder to become seasoning powder. The oldest brand of seasoning powder made by the Japanese is "Aji-no-moto," which has been sold on the market for a long time. According to estimates by people in the industry, the promotion of "Aji-no-moto" in our country was managed by the Japanese company Suzuki &amp; Co. In the past, when imports were at their peak, they averaged 200,000 yuan per month. This shows the increasing standard of living of the Chinese people and the urgent need for seasoning powder. Therefore, patriotic people rose up to imitate it themselves to save this drainage. The Geng Taihe Seasoning Powder Factory, established in Shanghai in 1922, was the beginning. Afterward, many others followed suit, such as the Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, established in 1923, and the Tianyi Monosodium Glutamate Factory, opened in 1926. From 1929 to 1931, five factories, including Hongfu and Taiyi, sprang up, which was a great boom. Later, due to the Shanghai Incident, the world economic panic, and the return of Japanese goods, the industry declined. Only the Tianyuan Monosodium Glutamate Factory was newly established, and closures were common, such as the Weizhong and Gengtai factories, which were relatively large. As of today, only six companies in Shanghai have a relatively large production scale: Tianchu, Tianyi, the Seasoning Department of China Chemical Industry Society, Taiyi, Tiansheng, and Tianyuan.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, seasoning powder was invented by the Japanese and has been sold in our market for a decade. However, after Chinese factories began producing seasoning powder, the number of domestic seasoning powders increased, and Japanese goods were squeezed out to a considerable extent. After the "September 18th Incident" in Shenyang, the Chinese people unanimously boycotted Japanese goods, and Japanese seasoning powder almost disappeared. This was truly a blessing for national industry. However, in the past two years, the situation between China and Japan has changed drastically again, and the government and the public are competing to advocate friendship, so Japanese goods are selling unimpeded again. Currently, the yellow-tin and white-tin seasoning powders sold in various Nanhua stores on the market are all imported Japanese goods. These tin seasoning powders have no labels or trademarks, and are easily mixed and sold on the market. Some unscrupulous merchants are willing to repackage them and pretend they are domestic goods, which makes the situation even worse. It is estimated that the current annual imports average about one million yuan, so we should pay attention to its development prospects.</p>
<p>II. Current Situation of Major Chinese Factories: Of the seasoning powder factories currently existing in this city, only six companies, including Tianchu, are relatively large, as mentioned earlier. Their current situation is described below:</p>
<p>1. Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory: The factory was established in 1923 with an initial capital of only 50,000 yuan. It was established by wealthy merchants Zhang Yiyun, Wu Yun Chu, Wang Dongyuan, and others in partnership. It currently has three factories, all located on Caishi Road and Xinqiao Road in the French Concession. The distribution office was previously located in Zhongwang Lane on Ningbo Road and has now been moved to near Zilai Street on Route Edouard. The factory is equipped with steam boilers, flour kneading machines, Shanghai machines, centrifugal machines, and other equipment. The first factory is used for cutting and manufacturing, and has 150 to 160 workers. The second factory occupies a large area and was previously used for bottling and decorating, and has more than 200 workers. The third factory is used for white-making and has more than 100 workers. It is said that the expenses of each factory are about 10,000 yuan per month. The factory's "Buddha Hand" brand monosodium glutamate is white and delicious, comparable to the Japanese "Aji-no-moto." The company also produced a second brand called "Guding" a few years ago to compete with its competitors in the same industry. The monthly production is about 20,000 pounds. The turnover was only tens of thousands of yuan at first, but after 1926, it increased dramatically. In recent years, it has reached about 2 million yuan per year, generating a great deal of profit. Last autumn, the factory had plans to reorganize into a limited company. This autumn, the reorganization was successful, and the capital was increased to 2 million yuan, most of which was transferred from accumulated public funds over the years. It is said that only a small number of new shareholders were recruited.</p>
<p>2. Tianyi Monosodium Glutamate Factory: The factory was established in July 1926. Initially, its scope was very small. It was opened in partnership by Ye Mojun, Shui Weichen, and others with a capital of only 10,000 yuan. Due to the expansion of the scope, the capital was increased to 50,000 yuan the following year. With hard work, there has been progress every year. It has now been reorganized into a limited company, and the capital has also been increased to 200,000 yuan. The factory has two manufacturing plants, one on Huade Road and one on Kunming Road. The distribution office is located at 243 Zhifu Road, and a branch distribution office is located on Johnston Road in Hong Kong. Its application machinery is considered complete, and there are often more than 100 workers. Its "Lotus" brand monosodium glutamate is quite popular. A second brand, "Golden Star" seasoning powder, was also produced a few years ago, and its quality is also good. It is said that the annual turnover is often around 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>3. The Seasoning Department of the China Chemical Industry Society: The society has a wide scope and a capital of 1 million yuan. Seasoning is only one of its businesses, named "Guanyin Powder." It also uses by-products to manufacture soy sauce essence. The equipment in the factory, such as starch machines, saccharifiers, and carbonizers, is very complete. The annual turnover is 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Recently, it has also launched a second brand, "Wei Sheng," to meet market sales.</p>
<p>4. Taiyi Malt Extract Powder Factory: The factory was established in August 1929 with a capital of 30,000 yuan. It was opened in partnership by Wang Zhenyu, Zhang Jingchu, and others. It originally had two factories, the first at 85 Haichang Branch Road in Zhabei, and the second at 55 Hengqing Lane on Beile Road in the French Concession. Unfortunately, the second factory was completely destroyed by a boiler explosion in August 1934 (more than 30 workers died, and the factory owner Zhang Jingchu also died in the accident), so only one factory remains. The factory is not large, and the equipment is relatively simple. Its "Double Peach" brand malt extract powder is also sold at a lower price and is still welcomed by ordinary people.</p>

<h3>Western YMCA Basketball: Pirates Retain Championship</h3>
<p>Xie Xing Loses by Four Points</p>
<p>Result: 45 to 49</p>
<p>The Xie Xing basketball team repeated Ji Fu's mistake again, failing to score baskets, losing to the Pirates by a score of 45 to 49. If they could have made every penalty shot, they really could have won. The Pirates have now secured the championship with eight wins in eight games. Even if they lose to Donghua in the last game, it will not have any impact. The standings for Group A are listed below, so you can see the situation at a glance:</p>
<p>Taking the Lead First The match was delayed until 9:05 PM to begin. After the jump ball, Pirate Pissell, assisted by Carson, scored first. Xie Xing responded calmly. Qiu Guangxie scored first, and Weng Ren'an attacked second, quickly taking the lead with a score of 4 to 2. Ryan then tied the score. Xu Heng made a long shot, and Zhou Dayun succeeded with a free throw, and Xie Xing took the lead again with a score of 7 to 6. Afterward, Weng Ren'an and Xu Heng added five more points, and the Pirates fell behind with a score of 6 to 12.</p>
<p>Pirates Overcome After this, the Pirates gradually found success. Smith made two free throws, and Ryan scored under the basket, tying the score at 12. Squia committed a foul, and Zhang Jinxiang threw the ball too low, losing the opportunity to gain the upper hand. Carson scored with a shot and a free throw, and took the lead with a score of 15 to 12.</p>
<p>Following the Trend Zhang Jinxiang made a long shot, and the score was only one point behind. The Pirates then took advantage of the jump ball advantage of center Ryan. Smith scored three times in a row, and Squia put the ball in with one hand, and the score became 25 to 14. Zhang Jinxiang did not give up, and scored again. Ryan also returned the favor in the same way. Finally, Zhang Jinxiang showed his ability, and the first half ended with a score of 25 to 18.</p>
<p>Xie Xing Takes the Lead Xie Xing became more courageous in the second half. Zhou Dayun first made the score 20 to 15. Carson was quick with his attacks, and Xu Heng committed a foul, resulting in one point on the free throw. Zhang Jinxiang then scored two more shots, and the score became 24 to 26, only two points behind. The Pirates continued their efforts, and Carson, Smith, and Ryan all came at the right time, and scored four goals in a row. Then the score became 40 to 31. Zhou Dayun added four points, and Zhang Jinxiang was very brave, chasing the score to 39 to 42. Pirate White entered the field, replacing Pissell. Xie Xing's Zhou Dayun committed four fouls and was removed from the field, and Shen Chongjiao replaced him. Xu Heng and Shen Chongjiao made two shots, and Xie Xing took the lead with a score of 43 to 42.</p>
<p>The Key to Victory It is a pity that they could not maintain this lead. The Pirates were very active. Carson, Smith, and White scored one after another, and the score became 48 to 43. Xie Xing's Qiu Guangxie jumped up from the crowd and threw the ball in, making the score 45 to 48. Finally, Carson made a free throw, resulting in the exciting score of 49 to 45. Xie Xing lost by four points.</p>
<p>Evaluation of Skills The performance of the entire Xie Xing team was no worse than that of the Pirates. Zhang Jinxiang, Weng Ren'an, and others could attack and defend, and were truly rare talents. It is a pity that the entire team was not accurate with their shots, which led to their loss. However, in terms of their tireless struggle, they were glorious even in defeat. Pirate Ryan was tall and strong, which gave him an advantage. Carson was intelligent and courageous, and made all nine free throws, making him the only hero of the Pirates.</p>

<h3>China Youth Basketball Kicks Off Yesterday: Qingzhong and Two Other Teams Win</h3>
<p>Bank Group: Shanghai Jia Overcomes Zhongnan Team</p>
<p>School and Business Group Matches Become One-Sided</p>
<p>The 7th Men's and Women's Basketball League organized by China Youth kicked off at 5:00 PM yesterday at the association's gymnasium. The opening match was Qingzhong vs. Gezhi in the school group. Qingzhong has strong strength, and Gezhi was not their opponent, suffering a crushing defeat with a score of 51 to 15. This was followed by Shanghai Jia vs. Zhongnan in the bank group. Shanghai Jia has talent in every age group. Although Zhongnan has one or two strong players, they were still no match. The match became one-sided, with a score of 62 to 37. The third game was Guangyi Jia vs. Xiangtai Yi. The strength of the two sides was very different, and the match was not exciting. Guangyi Jia triumphed with a score of 56 to 9. The details of yesterday's match are as follows:</p>
<p>Qingzhong Defeats Gezhi: In the opening match, Qingzhong vs. Gezhi, Qingzhong has young players such as Yan Juxian, and their strength is still stable. Gezhi ultimately surrendered. In the first half, Hu Shouchang and Liu Mingda of Qingzhong made every shot, but fortunately, Gezhi's defense was quite tight, and the score difference was not far, 22 to 11, with Qingzhong in the lead. Not long after the start of the second half, Gezhi's main players He Shuhu and Feng Yaosen were successively called out for four fouls, and their strength became more unstable. It seemed as if it was entirely Qingzhong's world. Yang Mingda showed off his skills under the basket, and the score soared, like a whirlwind sweeping away the clouds. Later, Gezhi was exhausted, but their spirit remained consistent. In the end, Qingzhong defeated Gezhi with a score of 51 to 15.</p>
<p>Shanghai Defeats Zhongnan: Next was Shanghai Jia vs. Zhongnan, the first match in the bank group. Shanghai has many talents, such as Ren Jiexing and Ye Zuyun, and their strength is tough. Zhongnan also has Zhao Qingxiang and Lin Yunchao, who are not weak. The match was quite exciting. Shanghai opened the scoring. Ren and Ye combined well, and the score increased rapidly. Lin Yunchao and Zhao Qingxiang of Zhongnan also scored successively, and the score was very close. However, Zhongnan's shooting was inaccurate, which was a big disadvantage. Shanghai's momentum was strong, and Ren and Li scored consecutively. In the first half, Shanghai took the lead with a score of 35 to 14. In the second half, Zhongnan was careful and tried to recover, but Shanghai's defense was very tight, with no chance to take advantage of. In the end, Shanghai defeated them with a score of 62 to 37.</p>
<p>Guangyi Defeats Xiangtai: Guangyi is a rising force with many strong players. Xiangtai's strength is ordinary, and they were not their opponent. In the first half, Xiangtai worked hard, and the game was lively. Guangyi's Wen and Liu did not fully exert themselves, only taking the lead with a score of 19 to 7. In the second half, Guangyi brought in Lu Chongrui, and their momentum began to rise. Xiangtai was already exhausted. Guangyi's score increased sharply, and Xiangtai's defense became more lax. Lu Chongrui was unstoppable, shooting from long range. At this point, Xiangtai could only parry and could not fight back. In the end, they lost to Guangyi with a score of 56 to 9. The results of yesterday's match are recorded below: School Group: Qingzhong defeated Gezhi, 51 to 15; Bank Group: Shanghai Jia defeated Zhongnan, 62 to 37; Business Group: Guangyi Jia defeated Xiangtai Yi, 56 to 9.</p>

<p>Children's Educational Novel</p>
<h3>Little Men (1) (5) (2) Louisa M.</h3>
<p>— Original by Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>When Ned said it, his expression was so depressed that Don could no longer bear it, so he muttered to himself in a broken voice, "You won't have to wait long." After saying that, he walked away quickly and was not seen for several hours.</p>
<p>Since there was such an unfortunate mess this week, everyone was suspicious and bored, so the days felt particularly long. When the children saw that Don was a little different on Sunday, they asked each other, "What's wrong with Don?" Usually he was happy and angry, but that day he was very silent, and no one could pry into his heart. When they were walking, he left the crowd and walked alone, returning later than others. He didn't participate in the evening conversation, but sat alone in the shadows, busy with his own thoughts, as if he didn't hear anything. Later, Mrs. Shu took out the cultivation book and showed him a particularly good report card. Although he looked at it, he didn't smile at all, and only said:</p>
<p>"Do you think I can still pass?"</p>
<p>"Very good, very good, Don! I'm so happy, because I often think you just need a little help to make you a good kid." Topic: The Reasons for Rural Decline. Speaker: Zou Shuwen. Time: 6:30 PM to 7:00 PM. Frequency: 660 (Central Broadcasting Station)</p>

<h3>Securities: After a Sharp Drop in Early Trading</h3>
<p>Bond Rebound Soars</p>
<p>--This Month's Gold Short Still Less Than One Yuan--</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange experienced a sharp drop in the market, followed by a sudden rebound, as the reporter expected. Market rumors have not subsided, and arbitrage trading has not taken action. In the absence of profitable conditions, it is naturally impossible to swap. It is also reported that some have already prepared to deliver and are unwilling to swap. The current situation is not optimistic. Yesterday, numbers 4 and 69 were buying in large quantities, and retail investors were also covering their short positions. This kind of return wind is a due phenomenon, but the trend is likely to be unsustainable. A sharp rise and quick retreat will inevitably result in the short side prevailing again. Judging from the sales of numbers 48 and 34.43, as well as the Beibang, and the short covering by the long side, the pressure is still heavy and it is not yet the time to expand. Yesterday's process opened extremely weak, with Xinfeng losing a small half yuan, and Cai Bing losing 7.5 cents. After that, the downward trend did not stop, and the gold short this month, number 48, turned short and sold in large quantities, falling by as much as 1.55 yuan. Although numbers 4, 5, 16, and 69 bought a lot, they were still unable to struggle due to excessive high pressure. The settlement disk was mostly due to swap trading, and the market price gradually rose. Numbers 4, 12, and 16 took the opportunity to raise prices, and the salt tax rose sharply by 7 cents, causing retail investors' vision to be confused, and they also made quite a few supplements. Only one disk was made in the afternoon, and the Beibang continued to sell. Cai Bing got rid of a huge amount, and the post was pulled by numbers 4, 16, 69, and 78 again, and continued to rise slightly. The 22-yuan level was raised by 6 cents again. This kind of rebound is still felt to be lacking in strength, and it is ultimately feared that it will be temporary and short-lived. As a result, only the 22-yuan level, the 23-yuan level, and the entire 6-yuan level rose by about 5 or 6 cents, while the rest fell sharply by 2 or 3 cents to 5 or 6 cents. The total transaction volume was 24.87 million yuan. The results of its rise and fall are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported yesterday (the 12th) that the New York stock market finally rebounded under the leadership of railway stocks, because the New Haven Railway announced that it would pay the interest on the bonds due, and at the same time, the market was also affected by the increase in freight volume and the outlook for income. The Dow Jones Railway Stock Index rose to the highest level since 1934. Because it was initially expected that the Supreme Court would declare the power plant case in the Tennessee Valley to be illegal, the price of public stocks was raised, and then the bulls began to sell because the court did not pronounce judgment, but it still recovered high before the close. Automobile stocks had investment purchases, and the price was still firm. Oil, sugar, and special stocks rose, and the transaction was clear, the price market was strong and lively, and small exchange stocks advanced. The total transaction volume for the day was 2.6 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn is Prepared to Receive Goods</h3>
<p>Some Yarn Delivered by Foreign Factories is Unqualified</p>
<p>The yarn market is stable, and the situation is becoming more and more consolidated. There is only one day of business left this month. It is said that 500 bales of 20-count yarn from a certain national yarn factory in Qingdao were discharged, of which 200 bales were found to be too light in weight, and 50 bales of yarn from a certain foreign factory in Shanghai were found to be yellowish in color. A total of 250 bales were unqualified and were unanimously returned. As a result, people's hearts were greatly encouraged. On the receiving side, Changfeng is prepared to accept 3,000 bales, and the China Cotton Company is also said to be receiving goods, so the market situation is relatively quiet.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster is Getting More Stable</p>
<p>The opening of the branded yarn market in the morning session was extremely mediocre, and transactions were still lacking. As the end-of-month settlement period approached, everyone was busy closing out, the scope of business was shrinking, and there were no highlights in the market at all, but in this month, a certain company and the China Cotton Company were both going to receive goods, and the market price turned up. As a result, each month rose by 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 cents compared to the previous day's closing price. After the opening of the afternoon session, there was a slight decline. After taking pictures to the second disk, the Osaka Sanpin Yarn rebounded. This month, there were 250 bales of 20-count yarn from a certain country, and the color and weight were all unqualified and returned. People's hearts turned firm, and the market price was tired but hard. As a result, each month rose by 0.1 and 0.2 cents compared to the previous day's closing price. It was found that DAFU sold 400 bales, Dafeng 1,100 bales, Gengfeng 450 bales, Chang 350 bales, Shengyuan 1,900 bales, Minghua 400 bales, Changfeng 450 bales, Dachang 400 bales, and Jinkang 950 bales. Yuda bought 390 bales, Daji 500 bales, Mingde 850 bales, Hengde called 100 bales, Shenji 500 bales, Yuanyuan 1,100 bales, Yichang 600 bales, Changfeng 450 bales, and Jiacheng 650 bales, Hengchang 600 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Actual Sales Declined</p>
<p>Actual yarn sales were less than before, because the end-of-month settlement period was approaching. The total number of effective statistics for the whole day was 411 bales. The market price was no different from the previous day. The purchase amounts of each gang are as follows:</p>
<h3>Inspected Cotton Passes 30,000 Bales</h3>
<p>The cotton market was weak in the morning but rose in the afternoon. This month's forward contracts expire tomorrow, the last day. Inspected and approved cotton by the Cotton Inspection Bureau has already surpassed 30,000 bales. It is rumored that the China Cotton Corporation is also buying. Many arbitrageurs in the financial sector remain active, pushing the price past the 40-yuan mark and back out of customs.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Sees Positive Market Outlook</p>
<p>In the opening cotton yarn market, American cotton prices varied, slightly increasing by 1 to 5 points. Indian cotton prices plummeted by 0.075 to 2.25 rupees. Gold prices remained unchanged, and market sentiment was generally fatigued, leading to a rather quiet market. As a result, prices for all months fell by 5 fen to 1 jiao compared to the previous day's closing prices. The afternoon opening remained uneventful. After the second trading session, cotton prices in Osaka's three-grade market steadily rose. This month suddenly turned strong and expensive, due to some buying activity. As a result, prices for all months rose nearly 5 fen for near-term contracts and 3 jiao to 3.5 jiao for distant contracts compared to the morning closing prices. Reported sales included 1,000 bales of Da Ji, 1,000 bales of Heng Yi, 1,300 bales of Ji Feng, 2,900 bales of Tong Ji, 1,600 bales of Geng Feng, 1,800 bales of Shen Chang, 900 bales of Chang Feng, 800 bales of Run Kang, 2,100 bales of Sheng Yuan, and 2,400 bales of Chang He. Reported purchases included 1,000 bales of He Yu, 1,700 bales of Shen Chang, 1,200 bales of Da Fu, 2,600 bales of Ren Feng, 1,500 bales of Yi Da, 1,000 bales of Yi Chang, 1,100 bales of Xin Cheng, 1,100 bales of Yi Kang, and 2,700 bales of Yuan Yu Chang. The highest and lowest prices, as well as closing prices, for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Factories Delay Raw Material Purchases</p>
<p>Cotton consumption is gradually declining, and factories are temporarily suspending operations. Raw materials are being temporarily</p>
<p>February Government Bond Repayment and Interest Payment Table is delayed. Source includes 1,060 bales, of which 650 bales are Tonghua cotton, 59.50 bales are foreign and domestic factory imports. 82 pieces of spot goods sent to the factory. 44.40 bales of Anqing cotton sent to the Shenxin factory, and 400 bales of spot goods sent to the factory.</p>
<h3>Previous Month Sees Increase in Japanese Yarn Exports</h3>
<p>This port's Japanese factory yarn exports in December of last year amounted to 30,539 bales, an increase of 317 bales compared to the 20,221 bales in the previous month. Shanghai had the strongest sales, accounting for 18,246 bales. In North China, Tianjin had 3,915 bales. In terms of exports, India had 3,357 bales. The quantities shipped for export and their destinations are listed below (unit: bales):</p>
<h3>Peng Kehai Case Not Accepted; US Cotton Price Inconsistent</h3>
<p>——Must See the Verdict of the Georgia Case——</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened weakly due to poor news from Liverpool. Liverpool sellers, Southern hedge sellers, and long positions were closed, causing prices for all months to fall by 4 to 8 points. Subsequently, short covering and the High Court's inability to overturn the Peng Kehai clause due to legal reasons led to a price rebound. However, the Georgia case may be related to the Peng Kehai case, causing uncertain market conditions. The general opinion is that under the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, the Peng Kehai clause cannot be invalidated. The market closed flat, with spot prices unchanged and futures prices up 1 to 5 points. The Louisiana rice mill case is considered a factor influencing market fluctuations by textile merchants. The exchange reported that global cotton production for this season is 25,500,000 bales, compared to 22,612,000 bales last year. American cotton production is 10,641,000 bales, compared to 9,576,000 bales in the same period last year. Two years ago, American cotton production was 13,200,000 bales. Spot prices for English cotton fell by 5 points, and futures prices fell by 67 points. Indian cotton was bought by European exporters, futures traders sold slightly, and operators also sold off, but speculators bought. In the end, the market weakened due to poor news from Liverpool. Pinkgor fell by 0.75 to 1.5 rupees, and Oomra and White Broach fell by 2.25 rupees. The original telegram is on the left (dated 13th).</p>
<p>According to a Bombay telegram, the opening prediction for White Broach cotton on the 14th is 2.25 rupees higher than the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Grains: Customers Hedge Sell New Flour</h3>
<p>Flour Exchange to Close for 10 Days Starting January 18th</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was weak again. After opening in the morning, the price of foreign wheat was quoted, with Chicago near-term down a little over 3 jiao, distant-term down a little over 4 fen, and Canadian wheat up 48 fen. Market sentiment, due to the nearing of the settlement date, saw some profit-taking by long positions. Therefore, although opening prices were still stable, prices gradually declined. However, trading turned quiet and lifeless. In the afternoon opening, trading was even more quiet, with few buyers. Near-term months generally fluctuated, while June new flour was extremely weak due to customer hedge selling. The closing date has been set for January 18th to January 27th, with trading resuming as usual on the 28th. This has been announced to the market.</p>
<h3>A Few Long Positions Unload Wheat Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was uniformly weak across all months after the morning opening. With the settlement date approaching, trading activities from all parties came to a standstill. A small number of long positions slightly reduced their holdings due to settlement reasons, causing the market to calm. In the afternoon opening, near and distant months weakened further due to the weakness of the flour market, with opening prices falling by 1 to 2 fen. Compared to the previous day, the current month fell by 7 fen, and distant months fell by a little over 3.5 fen. However, volume was very low, and the underlying market remained firm. Only after settlement can some activity be expected. Spot wheat remained stagnant and unopened due to inactive mill demand.</p>
<h3>Abundant Arrivals, Slow Sales, Rice Prices Continue to Weaken</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Sources from various gangs totaling sixty-plus companies, (goods totaling twelve to thirteen thousand piculs) retail sales are sluggish, wholesale activity involves three to four thousand bags, market conditions continue to weaken due to abundant arrivals, Nangang early rice is slightly cheaper, Su Tong glutinous rice is barely stable, thin rice is also reduced by three to five fen, Du Yang pointed rice supply and demand are similar, sales of cloudy rice are not widespread, falling another one or two jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various roads totaling forty-six to forty-seven companies, white glutinous rice sales in the market, although the weather is continuously rainy, shop demand is slightly moving, stockpiles are being delivered, prices have fallen by a few fen to one jiao, early rice and thin glutinous rice retail sales are acceptable, prices are weak by a few fen, Yangbu pointed and Ke pointed retail sales are normal, prices are slightly lower by nearly one jiao, Baiyuan cloudy goods are quite firm, retail sales are stagnant, market prices are high by slightly over one jiao, medium is slightly lower by two jiao, prices for other goods are also showing a weakening trend.</p>
<h3>Ke Rice Market Awaits Better Times</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke rice market continued to see arrivals from the Yangtze River and various provinces in Zhejiang, but buyers have been limited because buyer groups are behind schedule and local businesses are winding down for the year, unwilling to increase orders. As a result, the market is flat and weak, but most cargo owners are still holding out for higher prices before selling, so the market price has not experienced a significant drop. Niu Zhi's year-end is approaching, and most parties are focusing on winding down. For a lively market, we must wait for better times. Yesterday, 922 bags of Jiangxi rice, 150 bags of former rice, and 320 bags of Wenzhou and Taizhou rice were opened, all handled by this street, it is said.</p>
<h3>Silk &amp; Tea: Silk Market Heavily Bullish Post-Holiday</h3>
<p>Recently, overseas markets have been quiet, and silk prices in New York and Yokohama continue to fluctuate, while domestically, due to the approaching Lunar New Year, silk mill customers are reluctant to buy, and manufacturers are closing their books for the year, with most showing a profit. The scarcity of silk and cocoons in storage at sea is well known. It is widely believed that silk prices will rise sharply after the Lunar New Year. Therefore, silk prices in Shanghai are very stable around this time. Yesterday's New York spot price was $1.93, and the futures price was $1.93. Yokohama's spot price was 877 yuan, and the futures price was 857 yuan.</p>
<h3>North &amp; South Goods: Dried Longan Regains Strength After Sharp Decline</h3>
<p>Dried longan meat arrivals have increased recently, coinciding with sluggish sales, causing prices to fall by more than ten yuan from their peak. However, the total output for this season is ultimately not large. This decline has led to a decrease in sources, and recent wholesale activity has slightly increased, with merchants showing renewed interest. As a result, prices have rebounded by six to seven yuan from before. It is predicted that the spring market will continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Dragon Mouth Vermicelli Arrivals Surge</h3>
<p>Dragon Mouth vermicelli suddenly soared to 31-32 yuan last week due to shortages in Shanghai, the highest price since the conversion to yuan. However, the arrival of over a thousand bags yesterday caused the market to plummet, and as current wholesale demand is weak, it is difficult to stabilize. Yesterday, merchants were selling at 26-27 yuan, a drop of five to six yuan, and further loosening is expected. Since the inventory has increased, a decline is natural.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>New Year in Huizhou</h3>
<p>— (Fang Zheng)</p>
<p>In my hometown of Huizhou, there is a New Year custom called "Going Out." On New Year's morning, the entire family, one by one, lines up to go out. The eldest leads the team, and each person carries a paper lantern. They walk slowly for several dozen steps, then stop to burn incense and pray. From the eldest to the youngest, they bow and then light firecrackers, the so-called "Three Consecutive Launches." This custom is very common; almost every family in my hometown practices this tradition. There is also a custom called "Opening the Brush," which seems more refined and is limited to those who study or do business. "Opening the Brush" involves writing auspicious phrases such as "Opening the Brush on New Year's Day brings good fortune to all things" or "Trying the Brush on New Year's Day brings good luck to all matters." After writing, the phrases are pasted near the writing desk or displayed in the living room. There is also a custom called "Sending Yuan Shi," which involves visiting relatives or friends on the second day of the New Year. Everyone exchanges "Yuan Shi," but not the real Yuan Shi, but large cakes made of flour. They are made by southern goods stores in the style of Shanghai steamed buns, hollow inside, with words like "Blessings and Wealth" or "Small Investment, Big Returns" written on them. When giving the cakes, people say, "I'm giving you a pair of Yuan Shi, eat them and make Yuan Shi," to bring wealth. The superstitions of the people can be seen in this.</p>
<h3>Seven-Family Tea and Hundred-Family Lock</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>"Seven-Family Tea" and "Hundred-Family Lock" are very popular superstitious customs in my hometown, Suzhou.</p>
<p>Seven-family tea is said to cure all kinds of stomach problems. For example, chest discomfort and indigestion can be cured by drinking seven-family tea. Seven-family tea is made by begging for a pinch of tea leaves from each of seven different Zheng families across the street. Those who drink seven-family tea are mostly poor people. When they get sick, they can't afford to see a doctor, especially for minor illnesses. Of course, they can't afford to spend money on medicine, so they beg for seven-family tea to help them. I have never drunk seven-family tea, so I don't know if it is effective. I also don't know if tea leaves can cure diseases. In any case, the tea leaves from the seven families may have been bought from the same tea shop or even picked from the same tea tree. So, I advise those who believe in seven-family tea to just save themselves the trouble and brew tea from their own tea canisters.</p>
<p>Hundred-family locks are for wealthy and poor families who have children and are afraid that they will be sick. So, they prepare one hundred red paper envelopes and ask relatives and friends for a copper coin. When each of the one hundred red paper envelopes contains a copper coin, they pour them out and have a goldsmith make a gold lock. Although a gold lock costs at least ten or more yuan, the one hundred coins that were begged must be given to the goldsmith as payment. It is said that wearing this hundred-family lock will ensure a long life. Every time I go back to my hometown, people ask me for money. Once, I said to a certain Mrs. who asked me for a coin, "I heard that wearing a hundred-family lock is very dangerous because if something happens to the children in the hundred families, the child wearing the hundred-family lock will also be affected." When the lady heard me say this, her face turned pale, and she stopped.</p>
<p>This ridiculous method of defeating the hundred-family lock is actually using superstition to resist superstition, which is not worthy of emulation. However, at a time when education is not widespread and the people's intelligence is not highly developed, I think that if you are unwilling to spend a single coin in reality, but on the surface, you want to put up the banner of breaking superstition, this kind of ridiculous propaganda can be very useful.</p>
<h3>New Year in England</h3>
<p>— Yu Translation</p>
<p>The English have several customs related to saying goodbye to the old year and welcoming the new year that resemble superstitions. People living north of Twit consider New Year's Eve more important than New Year's Day. People living in Scotland must hold a "Hogmanay" family banquet on New Year's Eve. The banquet should begin after the new year has started, at least after the midnight bells have rung, so that they can drink to their hearts' content. The origin of this custom is probably to express the joy of passing the old year and the ease of entering the new year. Scots living overseas still maintain this custom.</p>
<p>If the fire suddenly goes out during the Hogmanay family banquet, it is a very bad omen. If a neighbor comes to borrow fire during the banquet, the host will not give it to him under any circumstances; otherwise, all the good luck of the year will be given away. In some places, people believe that the person who pours the last glass of wine from the last bottle during the New Year's Eve dinner is extremely lucky and is called "the lucky glass of wine," but it must happen by chance and cannot be arranged in advance. If this lucky glass of wine is drunk by an unmarried person, then it is predicted that they will have good fortune and will get married in the coming year.</p>
<p>If you have nothing in your pockets on New Year's morning, then you will live a year of poverty. People with empty hands cannot enter other people's homes on New Year's Day. The first guest to offer New Year's greetings is called the First Foot, and the English take this very seriously. If the first person to cross the threshold is a woman, then it is certain that the year's luck will not be good. In Klock Pashar, a black-haired person is considered a lucky First Foot, and the most unlucky person is a red-haired person. In some places, people prepare a cup of wine and a piece of cake to offer to the First Foot.</p>
<p>In Sussex, groups of young men and women gather in groups of three or five and go to people's homes to be the First Foot. The first person gets a silver coin, a piece of chopped cake, and a cup of hot elderberry wine with sugar and spices. The second person gets a copper coin. There is also a custom here that you must not take anything out of the house on New Year's Day, but it doesn't matter if you bring things into the house. Even the smallest and cheapest things, such as tea leaves, potato peels, and coal ash, should be carefully kept overnight and taken out the next morning. This will ensure that income exceeds expenses throughout the year.</p>
<h3>Little West Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 23: Raising High Arguments Around the Room to Start a Lawsuit; Forgetting Grudges by Pouring Out Old Friendship</p>
<p>He replied with a smile, not caring much: "If one person sues me, I am the defendant. If a group of people sues me, I am just a defendant. Conversely, if I am one person and everyone thinks it's a very serious women's issue, and I sue a group of people, it's just a women's issue. I've figured it out this way, so what am I afraid of?" He became excited, disregarding everything, and continued to express his grievances. The interviewer saw that he was speaking without any restraint and that it was public, so he marked the most important words in his notebook, secretly recording them. Jia Duocai clearly saw this but smiled at him: "Brother, this is just private talk, treating you as a friend, that's why I spoke so casually. I think you understand this in your heart and wouldn't publish these words in the newspaper." The interviewer smiled: "I don't think there's any harm in that. Anyway, Mr. Jia is prepared to sue them, so why be afraid of offending them? Moreover, Mr. Jia is a person of status and wouldn't go back on his words, right?" As he spoke, he closed his notebook and put it in his pocket. Then, he stood up to take his leave. Jia Duocai was very distressed, not being able to stop him and not being able to let him go. So, he smiled and rushed to the door, saying: "I still have a lot to talk about with you. As a news reporter, although the more news material, the better, you should also know the art of capturing and releasing the interviewee." The interviewer smiled: "I am very happy for Mr. Jia to tell me more. However, my working hours have arrived, and I don't have time to write it down. I think Mr. Jia would allow me to publish all the conversations in the newspaper, and we would be very grateful." As he spoke, he turned his body sideways, squeezed out of the door, and smiled, nodding and saying: "Goodbye, goodbye." Before Jia Duocai could say anything, he had already walked far away. Jia Duocai stood at the door, lost in thought. He had been too excited just now and gave the reporter a lot of material. When it is published tomorrow, these ladies will definitely react strongly. This Little West Heaven is their base camp, and perhaps tomorrow they will repeat today's scene. (892)</p>
<h3>Love Duel at the Foot of Mount Kiso in Japan</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Mount Kiso is the only mountain in Japan with many pines and cypresses, and several thousand families live nearby. Their occupations can be roughly divided into four types: one is agriculture, in addition to planting grains and mulberry trees, they also plant various fruits and operate simple pottery businesses; one is fishing, there are many natural rivers near the mountain for them to fish in, but recently most people dig ponds to raise fish and make canned foods to be transported to the city; one is handicraft industry, which is carving various shells into simple and rough works of art; and one is commerce, transporting products from the villages of Kiso to various places, and at the same time transporting the things needed by the mountain people. Among these four occupations, commerce is the easiest, and the people who work in handicrafts live well, and they mostly live at the foot of Mount Kiso.</p>
<p>The various houses at the foot of Mount Kiso have a different kind of beautiful scenery because of the pines and cypresses interspersed between them. Often, a shell carving is hung in front of each household, and red silk and green ribbons flutter in the wind with this artwork, which is very beautiful. Moreover, many households tie a small bell to the silk thread or ribbon, and the bell also makes a sound, which is particularly lively, and they sing songs to each other, which is tireless all day long. During festivals, especially the New Year, everyone wears new clothes and holds many art objects, either throwing them as ball games or wearing them as decorations, as if they have not yet broken away from the barbaric era, and they dance in various ways in the shade of the pine and cypress trees. When they dance, they always take shell carvings as dancing objects, and the dancing postures are very strange. The four words "more jumping than dancing" can really describe most of their postures.</p>
<p>Although their dances are mixed with men and women, there is also a very strict boundary. This boundary is different from other parts of Japan, that is, unmarried men and women can absolutely not dance with each other except with their parents. Therefore, the young men and women who dance must be married couples, otherwise, once it is found out, the parents will consider it the greatest shame and often send their children to monasteries or nunneries, and at the same time, they will never dance with each other again to avoid mentioning their feelings. It is said that in a certain village at the foot of this mountain in the past, there was a rich man whose unmarried daughter actually danced privately with an unknown unmarried man. Later, the rich man found out and poisoned his daughter to death, and he himself cut his hair and became a monk, holding a pessimistic view of everything in the world. This custom is extremely strange. At the same time, there is also a strange custom of love duels, which is not found in other parts of Japan, but is still prevailing in the foothills.</p>
<p>Love duels are held every year on the 15th of January, the 15th of July, and the 15th of October under the supervision of the village chief. The reason for holding them is often that two or three men fall in love with one woman, resulting in the woman's parents being unable to make a decision, or the woman's parents do not allow the man she likes, or the woman does not want to marry the man her parents like. After a love duel, the village chief judges who can be elected as the woman's husband, then the men and women all express their obedience.</p>
<p>The place for love duels is in a large open space at the foot of the mountain. On the day of the duel, all the people in the village come to watch. The men who duel all wear black hats and hold shell weapons in their hands to fight each other. After fifteen minutes of fighting, the village chief determines who wins and who loses. The victorious man is lifted up by many relatives, shouting victory, while the loser hangs his head and goes home with his relatives, who are all silent.</p>
<p>On the morning of the duel, the woman who is the object of the duel makes herself up very beautifully because that day is no different from her engagement day. However, she does not go out, but waits at home. As soon as the duel is over, she and her parents go out to dance, expressing their congratulations, but they must not dance with the victor of the duel before the formal marriage.</p>
<h3>Sky Burial and Cremation</h3>
<p>— Lu Hua</p>
<p>Sky burial is a custom that still exists in Tibet. That is, after a person dies, regardless of gender or age, the flesh is cut off piece by piece, and then the bones are smashed with a large iron cone to feed the birds and beasts, which is called sky burial. This method of cutting the flesh and the strange phenomenon of vultures vying for food were actually filmed by the photography team brought by Envoy Huang Musong when he went to Tibet last year. This newsreel has been shown once by the Moonlight Film Company. I was also in attendance. Seeing this torture that involved both dismemberment and bone crushing, one cannot help but feel a different kind of unbearable feeling! But in the Tibetan sense, it is believed that only in this way can the sins of the deceased be eliminated during his lifetime, and it is believed that the soul can ascend to heaven only if its corpse is completely eaten by birds and beasts.</p>
<p>Because I mentioned sky burial in Tibet, I also thought of a strange custom of cremation that is practiced among the southwestern barbarians. Cremation is a funeral method of a tribe of barbarians in the northwestern border of He County, Yunnan Province. When a person dies in their family, it is customary not to mourn, and they do not use a coffin. They only use a carrying pole through the body and carry it to the wilderness, where they pile up dead trees and burn it. This is called cremation. Only when the corpse is burned into charcoal do everyone cry loudly to show their grief. However, during the cremation, the people present must raise their hands and jump, shout wildly, and at the same time take wooden clappers, bamboo tubes, or copper and iron響器 to beat frantically, drumming and making a lot of noise, making a mess. It is said that the reason they make such a noise is to scare away the birds in the sky, so as not to come down and抢食 the meat of the dead. Because they believe that if the meat of the dead is eaten by birds, its soul will not ascend to heaven.</p>
<h3>Batak Marriage Customs</h3>
<p>— Green Moss</p>
<p>In the Dutch East Indies, Sumatra, there is a native people called the Batak. Due to their geographic location, they mature very early physically. Both boys and girls reach marriageable age at thirteen. For girls, it can be delayed by a year or two, which isn't a big deal, but for boys, marriage at thirteen is a must. Overseas Chinese children there who haven't married by seventeen or eighteen are considered quite strange.</p>
<p>Batak houses have two levels: people live upstairs, and pigs, cows, and other livestock are kept downstairs. However, when a boy turns thirteen, his family no longer allows him to live upstairs; he must sleep with the pigs and cows until he finds a spouse, after which he is allowed to live upstairs.</p>
<p>The Batak people have very immature knowledge and no sense of etiquette. The relationship between men and women is very casual. As long as a woman consents, there are no issues with sexual intercourse. Married women add a white border to their blue hats; unmarried women only wear blue hats. Any Batak man can flirt with any woman, but married women are less willing. They are very happy to flirt with unmarried women, and they will grant any request. After a Batak man meets an unfamiliar woman, he can ask, "Can I go play with you?" or "Shall we eat together?" If the woman agrees, you can go to the woods with her and do whatever you want.</p>
<p>The Batak people practice polygamy; a man can marry as many wives as he pleases. Batak women are very good at production work, endure hardship, and accumulate a lot of wealth to provide for their husbands to squander. The current Batak chieftain has over thirty wives.</p>
<p>Another strange thing about the Batak people is that it's hard to distinguish fathers from sons, because after a Batak father dies, his son has an obligation to marry his mother or his father's concubine. If a woman becomes pregnant and her husband dies, the child born is considered the inherited son, but in reality, he is his younger brother. The Batak people don't think about this.</p>

<h3>Catching the Book Thief</h3>
<p>— Jia Wei</p>
<p>I happened to visit a semi-public library that has a sign saying "Non-members or those without an annual reading certificate worth one yuan are not allowed to enter," and I saw a notice about "catching the book thief."</p>
<p>According to the notice: recently, some "immoral person" tore out a part of an English "Modern Historical Materials" magazine. Following that, some "similar" people took away English magazines such as "Asia" and "Middle School Students," which were "for public reading," from the bookshelves. Therefore, readers are asked to pay attention and help catch this "clever thief."</p>
<p>Damn it, our vast society is constantly producing these "scum." Previously, there were university students who became thieves, defrauded people of their money, became robbers... doing things that "铤而走险 (risk their lives)," and now there are "scholars" who take one or two magazines from public places, committing small thefts of "顺手牵羊 (taking something easily)." "Propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame" have been "lost completely." Truly, "the world is deteriorating, and people's hearts are not as good as before"—our moralistic gentlemen will "exclaim with emotion"!</p>
<p>I remember reading Lu Xun's "Kong Yiji" before—a person known for habitually stealing books—who said: "Stealing books doesn't count as theft... Stealing books... It's a scholar's business, how can it be considered stealing?..."</p>
<p>This is just Mr. "Kong Yiji's" sophistry, right? But he still says "君子固窃 (a gentleman steals as a matter of course)," "何者 (why)?" and other such "defending the Way" nonsense.</p>
<p>Here, we are certainly not going to compare these "stealing books" "thieves" who "take advantage of" the library with Mr. "Kong Yiji," who is famous for stealing books. But from this, we can better understand one side of our society: the extent to which the lives of ordinary "book-reading people" have become impoverished, and how serious the problem has become for the prospects of ordinary young "intellectuals."</p>
<p>However, no one can deny that today, with the entire social economy collapsing and the countryside bankrupt, cities depressed, markets withering, and all industries declining, the general working class is being abandoned by a small group of special people to struggle and compete on the line of hunger and death. The middle class of our society—small property owners—will inevitably and continuously become impoverished and decline... and our "book-reading people" and "intellectuals" will follow suit and become a problem!</p>
<p>Therefore, perhaps we can believe that the "book thief" mentioned above who tore out a part of a magazine and took away the entire magazine also has the same meaning as when "Kong Yiji" was ridiculed for his "sophistry": "Stealing books doesn't count as theft; stealing books, it's a scholar's business..." However, we can also believe that perhaps these "pests" will not be like "Kong Yiji," who "stole" one or two magazines worth a few mao to sell and buy wine to drink, right? But things seem to be similar. Thinking about the crowded "reader" who tore and "stole" a part of the English magazine, is he planning to translate it and sell it to solve his hunger?</p>
<p>Finally, we want to declare that we are not here to defend or protect these "book thieves." For these "immoral" and "without propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame" "pests" and "scum," we should "pay attention together and help catch them." However, the matter must be clarified: is this just a matter of "stealing"!</p>
<h3>Seagull</h3>
<p>— Laborious Mind</p>
<p>—The Story of Sea Travel—</p>
<p>After the cargo ship passed the Lion's Gate, everyone could steal a little free time.</p>
<p>Third Uncle sat on the rudder handle with his buttocks, slowly filling the foot-long pipe with a bowl of Lao Nongfu brand tobacco, striking a match, and pressing the tobacco on the pipe with his thumb. After a while, the fire approached the tobacco, and he began to suck on it with a "hulu hulu" sound. After a dense cloud of smoke was exhaled from his mouth, he began to nag us:</p>
<p>"Hoist the sail, did you forget? Useless, you bunch of Guangya Lane goods!"</p>
<p>We were startled and stood up, blindly hoisting the mast. Lao Gui quickly and nimbly grabbed and unfurled the sail. Lao Qi and I rushed to first erect the mast, hang the sail, and slowly unfurl it. We didn't make a sound, nor did we sing "yo ai yo" as usual while working. We were used to Third Uncle's temper. If you didn't argue with him and listened to him and worked smoothly, you could avoid hearing a lot of nagging.</p>
<p>This time, we had a chance to chat.</p>
<p>We sat on the cargo on the bow of the ship. The three of us, even Fifth Uncle, walked up from the stern, leaving Third Uncle alone to smoke his pipe—</p>
<p>"Damn it, we have to work even during the New Year, will we really have to work until New Year's Eve?"</p>
<p>Lao Qi, this guy with the worst temper, anything put in his stomach would turn into dynamite and explode. He loved to complain about himself, but he never really did what he said he would do. Fifth Uncle often ridiculed him for this.</p>
<p>"Lao Qi, you're losing your temper again! Who told you to do it? Why don't you go back and enjoy yourself—don't you want your old man to be reborn to serve you?"</p>
<p>"Old man, opening your mouth with old man, closing your mouth with old man, you are the son of a whore."</p>
<p>"You're really a savage, unreasonable, and no one is arguing with you!"</p>
<p>"Who is arguing with you? If you want to fight, fight in the Dragon King's palace!"</p>
<p>When two crickets meet, they often fight. We all resented the two of them, even during this free time, they mixed it up with吵呀闹地 (fighting and making noise), which was damn boring. Lao Gui lay diagonally, his eyes half-closed, with a bit of impatience:</p>
<p>"Dead cow! If you want to fight or make noise, why don't you go into the water! People are worrying about not being able to spend this free time peacefully, but you look like you have energy but nowhere to expend it."</p>
<p>Really, once we left the mouth of Lion's Gate, we could think about having a good time. There was no wind or waves here. The downstream boat just happened to be carried by the wind and water, without having to exert any effort.</p>
<p>The water surface was very calm. In the distance, there were occasionally one or two jumping fish, suddenly jumping up, opening a small hole in the water, the splash of water piercing very high. Following that, a small circle of water chased a large circle of water, the circles getting bigger and bigger, farther and farther. In the end, after taking a bath in the sun, reflecting the subtle ripples, it slowly disappeared.</p>
<p>Lao Gui sighed. I saw him staring at the flight of three or four seagulls, his heart seeming to be troubled by something, restless. I approached him and gently patted him:</p>
<p>"Lao Gui, what's so good about seagulls?"</p>
<p>He jumped up, raised his head as if someone had discovered a secret, looked at me, then lowered it again.</p>
<p>"Damn it! Seagulls are free. We have to work even during the New Year, not even as good as seagulls. It's not that Lao Qi has a bad temper, as long as there is a way to survive, 野仔 (even a wild child) would run away…"</p>
<p>Lao Qi's complaints插过 (interrupted) again. Lao Gui sneered. Fifth Uncle said:</p>
<p>"What's wrong with you again? Seagulls are free? Aren't they just doing it for food? You complain about having to work during the New Year? You're really an ungrateful person. I'd like to see you when you don't have anything to eat…"</p>
<p>"Ancestors for eighteen generations, you have to go against me, didn't I owe you money in my previous life!"</p>
<p>"What are you arguing about?" Lao Gui said with a bit of bitterness, "骂来骂去 (scolding each other) are all our own people, what's the point!" Lao Gui hadn't finished speaking when a very shrill "chi" sound rang out, and then we saw a pair of seagulls with broken feathers falling into the water. At first, it was still desperately holding its wings in the water, but when it couldn't hold on anymore, it was so weakly immersed in the water. Its body was surrounded by fish, and every now and then another pair of seagulls flew down, pecking a piece of meat from its body, and flying back.</p>
<p>We sighed and lowered our heads. Lao Gui stood up instead, exercising his arms, but eventually collapsed on the cargo again.</p>
<h3>Winter Gloom</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Ruiyuan</p>
<p>Winter is the season of autumn's nostalgia and spring's anticipation.</p>
<p>Without sunshine, without rain or snow, but ice destroys the vitality of grass and trees, condenses on the roof, on the branches, in the ditches, clings to nests without birds, and covers roads without pedestrians, there are often such days in winter.</p>
<p>On these days, I have no joy, no sorrow, my emotions belong to the winter gloom, paler than a winter morning. Even when covered in sunshine, drenched in rain and snow, I only have the feeling of light smoke. And I like to savor the thin dreams of autumn and the magnificent aspirations of spring.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is easy to feel lonely on gloomy winter days!</p>
<p>The loneliness in the room is more terrifying than the cold outside the house, and more so than the melancholy on the street and the harshness of the countryside.</p>
<p>In the morning, winter stands forlornly at my window, so there is a surge of the sea between the window sill, the window screen, and the curtains. The ice flowers clinging to the glass panes, and the ice columns hanging down, only add to the strangeness for me. I love to rest under the wall blocking the north wind because in the December sun, the bronze-golden old robe, the dust-covered old hat, and the opened book mean a suitable adjustment to loneliness.</p>
<p>I also like to wander the streets, from calmness to hustle and bustle, and from hustle and bustle to calmness, listening to the noisy sounds of the city, and watching my own steps. (Even on the cold winter streets, I have a lazy pace.) So, the one walking in the piles of run-down houses is me; the one looking at the woman selling roasted sweet potatoes at the bridgehead is me; the one looking for traces of children's spinning tops in the open space is me. And I often say to myself: how unbearable it would be to live in a cold room, living a bland and tasteless life.</p>
<p>And walking in the countryside is also a joy. I shrink my neck into my collar, put my hands in my pockets, and half-close my eyelids to resist the sharp wind of the wilderness. Winter has an even more ridiculous face. The weeds of autumn cannot withstand a night of狂风 (gale), ice, and frost, bending down and lying on the ground; the trees of winter have leafless branches that forcefully pierce into the low-pressure sky, which makes me think of the direction of the wild geese, and all the more secretly laugh at the rugged winter gloom.</p>
<p>But these are just casual hobbies. I have no bias against winter, neither hatred nor fondness. It's just in the淡白 (pale) emotions that I warm thin dreams and magnificent aspirations.</p>
<p>On gloomy winter days, I abhor loneliness more than I abhor the bitter cold.</p>
<h3>Blue Overcoat</h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>In the playground, Teacher Yang's silver whistle rang. A group of elementary school students, like a flock of little lambs, came running and jumping. They finally formed a square tofu-like formation. Teacher Yang, standing in front, blew the whistle again, and the little eyes of a flock of little lambs all looked over towards the teacher.</p>
<p>"Listen up, now prepare to go to the city to visit the exhibition. I told you yesterday that anyone who doesn't wear a blue overcoat will stay at school. Everyone look at yourselves, and anyone who doesn't wear a blue overcoat should automatically step out."</p>
<p>As soon as Teacher Yang finished speaking, a buzzing sound rose from the flock of little lambs, and their black little heads kept leaning forward and backward, and the formation became chaotic. Several multicolored guys quietly retreated from the center to a corner of the playground, their small eyes looking at the classmates who remained in the playground as if they had been wronged. Little Mao A-san jumped up and down happily, flipping over and pushing Ma Dacheng in the back row.</p>
<p>"You don't have a blue overcoat!" Ma Dacheng glared at Little Mao fiercely, ignoring her.</p>
<p>Teacher Yang's whistle rang again, and his face was obviously not as natural as before.</p>
<p>"Listen up! Haven't I often told you that a good student should be obedient and follow the rules? Ma Dacheng—why don't you step out?"</p>
<p>The black little heads in front all turned around again. Ma Dacheng's little face immediately turned as red as if it had been painted with a</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>layer of rouge. But she said very calmly.</p>
<p>"I want to go too." Her tone seemed very stubborn and crisp. The playground suddenly became quiet. Teacher Yang's face showed an even more unnatural color. He thought to himself, this child is too naughty, so he said:</p>
<p>"You want to go too? Then why don't you wear a blue overcoat?"</p>
<p>"My mom said that a black overcoat is the same, and I didn't make a blue overcoat." The playground burst into laughter.</p>
<p>"You know that's not true, who told your mom not to make one for you? Looking like you, you can't even wear an overcoat properly. The outside is not like the school, you'll be laughed at, you know that! Quick, quick, step out for me!" Teacher Yang walked over from the front and pushed Ma Dacheng out with one hand. Ma Dacheng burst into tears:</p>
<p>"My mom said that a black overcoat is the same, and I didn't make a blue overcoat, wuwu…"</p>
<p>The little lambs in the playground thought it was extremely funny and laughed again with a "poof" sound.</p>
<p>Teacher Yang walked back to the front as if nothing had happened, blew the whistle again, and shouted:</p>
<p>"Attention—at ease, original formation, turn left. March!"</p>
<p>The playground was quiet and寂寂 (silent), leaving behind a cloud of yellow dust…</p>

<p>Opening: "Flower Moon Linked Pearls"</p>
<p>The spring river and flower moon are the most prosperous. The moon reflects the flower wall, the flowers and the moon are together. Flowers love the bright moon, flowers love the moon. The moon moves the flower shadows, the moon moves the flowers. When the flowers bloom, waiting for the moon, the zither stops ringing. In the moonlight, urging the flowers, the drums beat wildly. The fallen flowers cover the ground with golden characters. A crescent moon, a jade hairpin. The world of flowers is always in spring. The monthly tides never fail. A bright moon, trimming jade axes. The plum blossoms, playing the bronze lute. Jianglang's dream revolves around the flower-producing brush. Zhang Ziyou's immortal wanders on the moon's raft. Face like peach blossoms, eyebrows like the moon. The bright moon in the water, the flowers in the mirror. It is good to rely on the old man of the moon to deliver the mandarin ducks. Asking the flower slave to pick up the phoenix hairpin. Worshiping the moon and burning incense, the love is just right. Burying flowers, lamenting that玉 (jade) is infinite. The moon in the reeds, the autumn guest in Xunyang. The lonely moon and plum blossoms, the hermit's home. The moon palace sweeps away the phoenix tail. The flower steps, the moon, the phoenix-head shoes. Scooping the moon in the water, the words become empty. Looking at the flowers in the mist, the interest is naturally good. Liang Yue怀人 (cherishing people), grieving at the Moon Pavilion. Wearing flowers on the head, reaching the top of the list, walking through the heavenly streets. The moon goddess lives in the lunar palace. The jade girl wipes the Linghua mirror. Wanting to roll up the pearl curtain, showing the night moon. For deleting the evil bamboo, irrigating the famous flowers. Falling flowers, crying birds, spring sorrow is eternal. The moon, remnant lamps, night dreams are vague. Planting flowers in the moon, guarding against rain and jealousy. Between the flowers, leaking the moon, borrowing the clouds to cover. The flowers drink wine, the wandering bees dance. The moon cave plays the flute, attracting the phoenix. The moon is a heavy quilt, the flowers are pillows. The flowers are the four walls, the moon is the home. The heavenly flowers are planted,迷 (confusing) the flower shadows. The autumn moon is often round, watching the moon's華 (splendor). The cold moon, the remnant wind, spring is lonely. Hearing the flowers, the willows, the road is askew. White clouds, thousands of miles, the moon at Guanshan. Green blood, thousands of prisons, the imperial son's flower. With the moon but without flowers, there is little interest. With flowers but without the moon, there is silence and no commotion. From now on. The flowers and moon send off the passing years.</p>

Because of the child's mother's story, Hu Die knows that this child is Xianglin, the son she had with Gao Zhanfei, but she doesn't dare to admit that he is her child, so she has to secretly caress Xianglin. Dexin and Xianglin are really too close. They go to the beach every day when the tide recedes to pick up shells. One day, Dexin doesn't know the danger and runs off alone. It happens to be when the tide is rising. By the time Xianglin arrives and discovers the danger, the tide has covered the beach. He knows that it is too late to call someone to save him, so he bravely jumps into the water, struggling with Dexin in the tide. However, his strength is ultimately insufficient. By the time others rescue them, they have already stopped breathing. Hu Die falls on their bodies, crying her heart out. She has been stimulated by being abandoned, and now she has lost two beloved sons. What a great tragedy!</p>

<h3>Automobile Using Wood Instead of Oil</h3>
<p>— Mingde</p>
<p>Recently read a German transportation magazine. Saw a record of German automobiles using wood instead of oil. Translated it below. For the reference of those who study automobile fuel.</p>
<p>Using solid fuel, such as wood, such as coal, to replace liquid fuel, such as automobiles, gasoline, to power factories and vehicle engines, French people had already tried and succeeded after the European War. The best structure of the French gasification-for-oil furnace is the one invented by Mr. Imbert. Now almost all French military vehicles have been converted to use Imbert gasification furnaces instead of gasoline.</p>
<p>The German side has also undergone several tests. First, coal gasification furnaces were built and installed in automobiles, but the firebricks built in the coal gasification furnaces were easily detached due to the vibration of the vehicles during operation, and could not be used. Later, the Imbert wood gasification furnace was used instead, and the results were very good. Compared with using oil, about 92% of the cost can be saved.</p>
<p>The Imbert wood gasification furnace can be divided into four main parts: the gasification furnace body, the condenser filter, the fan, and the air pipe. The entire furnace weighs about 100 to 150 kilograms. The gasification furnace body is made of iron plates and is shaped like a round tube. It is divided into inner and outer layers, about 1.5 meters high and 0.5 meters in diameter. There are no furnace firebricks and water jackets for cooling inside. There are many holes in the lower part of the furnace body. Some of the holes have covers that can be opened and closed to check the amount of charcoal stored in the furnace. Other parts of the holes have tongues that open and close inward. The charcoal is ignited through these holes when starting a fire. After the fire is lit, the air required for gasification in the furnace also flows in through these holes. However, when the gas in the furnace flows outward, the tongues will close automatically. In addition, there is also an ash discharge hole in the lower part. There is a cover on the upper part of the furnace body. After the cover is opened, firewood can be loaded. (Any kind of large wood chips can be used, but they must not be longer than 8 centimeters.) After the cover on the furnace is closed, the burning igniter is inserted through the ignition hole. The fan is turned on at the same time, and the charcoal in the furnace will burn. However, because there is too little air, it will not burn completely, and gas will be generated. After burning for about three or four minutes, the gas generated in the furnace is enough to start the engine. Then, the gas in the furnace passes through the air pipe to the condenser filter first, and the water and ash contained in the gas are condensed and retained in the condenser filter. This clean and cooled gas then passes through the air pipe fan to the air door. Here, it is mixed with the air flowing in from the outside to become gas suitable for the engine. It enters the汽缺 through the engine's intake valve. After the engine starts, the fan can be stopped. After that, the airflow in the furnace is completely drawn by the engine. If the automobile engine is stopped for about 15 minutes, the gas in the furnace can still start the engine. However, if the engine is stopped for too long, the fan must be used to restart the fire. The fan can be operated manually. If you want to eliminate the fan, there are two methods: Store a part of the gas generated in the furnace in another box. When starting the engine, use this stored gas. Initially use the automobile to start the engine.</p>
<p>The gas generated by the Imbert gasification furnace generates a burst pressure of 20 kilograms per cubic centimeter in the engine, which is about 10 kilograms smaller than gasoline per cubic centimeter. The burning rate in the汽缺 is also lower. Therefore, the engine runs very quietly, and it can reduce the engine's ignition problems in summer. As for fuel consumption, each time about 100 kilograms of firewood can be loaded into the furnace, which can travel 70 to 90 kilometers. Compared with gasoline, 2.2 kilograms of firewood can replace 1 kilogram of gasoline, so the cost is very economical.</p>
<h3>Overview of American Automobile Sales at the End of the Year</h3>
<p>— Lingyun</p>
<p>1935 has ended. 1936 has just begun. The American automobile manufacturing industry is at its most critical juncture at this time. Each car factory is trying its best to manufacture new cars to meet the needs of all parties. On the customer side, because the 1936 model new cars have already been released, they have decided which car they want to buy at this time. Orders are sent from the hands of dealers to the factory like snowflakes. According to news from Detroit, the total number of cars manufactured by each factory in the two months of November and December at the end of 1935 was about 700,000. This number should not be underestimated. Of course, Ford and Chevrolet are still the main producers among the factories. Their products are at the top. The weekly output is about 90,000 vehicles. People in the automobile industry expect that if nothing unexpected happens and the sales of automobiles are affected, then the manufacturing plans of each factory will be carried out completely according to the predetermined plan. The factory's output and sales are trending in the same direction. The future can be said to be good. In short, the factory's shipments are entirely based on sales. It is not difficult to adjust temporarily if there are changes in the market.</p>
<p>Since the autumn automobile exhibition, the automobile industry in Detroit has been showing a lively atmosphere. This is undeniable. The advantage that salesmen took in this exhibition was that they could immediately promise customers to deliver new cars quickly. Unlike when the exhibition was held in the first month of the year, customers wanted the goods, but the factory could not deliver them for a long time, which made people very impatient. Salesmen also discovered at the new car exhibition last autumn that most customers were prepared with cash and wanted to take their favorite new cars home immediately. Because of the strong sales of cars, each factory is working day and night, trying its best to rush production. The employment index in Detroit has also risen accordingly, and is at its highest level similar to September in 1933.</p>
<p>We only need to look at the weekly output of each factory to know the tense atmosphere in Detroit. The weekly output of each factory is as follows: Ford 25,000 vehicles, Chevrolet 25,000 vehicles, Plymouth 9,000 vehicles, Dodge 7,500 vehicles, Pontiac 6,000 vehicles, Walters Marmobile 5,000 vehicles, Buick 4,500 vehicles, Hudson Terraplane 3,500 vehicles, Packard 2,000 vehicles, Nash Lafiayette 1,350 vehicles, Studebaker 1,000 vehicles. There are many other factories that manufacture less than 1,000 vehicles per week. The largest comparative output among various vehicles is Buick, Packard, Dodge, Pontiac, Walters Marmobile, and Nash cars, which are priced around 1,000 US dollars. The good sales of these cars show that the sales of slightly higher-priced cars are good. This situation is completely different from 1931, 1932, 1933, and 1934. Looking at the end of 1935, Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler made the most profits. However, in general people's minds, 1936 is a very good year for several independent factories. The recent sales conferences held in New York and Chicago have clearly shown that the small factories are working hard to strive for their business.</p>
<p>Studebaker held an aggressive sales plan in December. According to George, the deputy sales manager, the total output in December could reach 10,000 vehicles. The output of the company's new Los Angeles factory could increase by 1,000 vehicles. Nash has also set a specific plan for the sales of 1936 model new cars. The most important thing is to use grand advertising sales. It is estimated that the sales in 1936 will increase by 75%. The output of Nash and Lafiayette in 1935 was about 75,000 vehicles. After the planned increase in output, the total number will be 130,000 vehicles.</p>
<p>The sales of Huppermobile in 1935 have shown a significant increase compared to the past three years. In the past ten months, the company encountered legal disputes. Everything has now been resolved. The sales department has also been reorganized, and McDonald has been appointed as the director. Graham-Paige's 1936 sales plan focuses on new-style low-priced cars with supercharged models. Domestic and overseas sales are being vigorously promoted. This plan coincides with the company's deputy manager Graham's promotion of the world market. Hudson estimates that its output will reach 33,500 vehicles by January 1 of this year. This is much more than the 25,000 vehicles planned earlier. According to Tralsher, the deputy manager of the sales department, the retail sales at the New York exhibition have broken the record of the past five years, and have increased by two and a half times compared to the previous year.</p>
<h3>The Opel Factory's Summer Olympics No. 4 Cylinder Car Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon</h3>
<p>The German Opel Automobile Factory is commemorating the grand event of the 1936 Summer Olympics, which will be held in Berlin. Therefore, it has specially refined the Summer Olympics No. 4 cylinder car for the world. The style of the new car is novel and beautiful, and the mechanical engineering is even more excellent. It is now known that it will be shipped to this place soon and will be sold by the local dealer, the United Automobile Company.</p>
<h3>The 1936 Model Huppermobile New Car</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Will Be Exhibited in Shanghai Soon</p>
<p>The 1936 model six-cylinder and eight-cylinder Huppermobile new cars are equipped with newly designed and transformed car bodies and a unique superior transmission that allows for carefree driving and operation. Therefore, their effectiveness is grand and outstanding, and their styles are extremely beautiful and moving. According to Mr. Gu Denan, the sales director of the local Huppermobile dealer, the Kangtai Automobile Company, this new car will be publicly displayed at the latest by the end of this month to meet with the people of Shanghai. Mr. Gu is currently actively arranging to hold the first exhibition of the new car in the sample room at 627 Foch Road within the last week of this month.</p>
<p>Huppermobile products have always been famous in the world for their beautiful styles. Now, the new cars are even more beautiful and spectacular. The new cars are divided into two major groups. Their graceful posture is not only pleasing to the eye and fascinating, but also reduces air resistance to the lowest possible limit. The interior is also more spacious and comfortable. The weight and passengers have been redistributed as much as possible. Therefore, it is extremely comfortable to be in them. In addition, what is even more commendable is that Huppermobile, in addition to being famous in the world for its absolute reliability and durability for twenty-eight years, has countless mechanical engineering features in terms of design and construction. These advantages are only available in vehicles with twice the price. Now, the new Huppermobile car has everything, which is even more commendable.</p>
<h3>British-Made Eight-Wheel Truck</h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>—Very Economical Freight—</p>
<p>The British Overseas Transport Advisory Committee has been studying an economical transportation method for several years to remedy the higher freight rates of railway transportation. This transportation method can reduce costs on the one hand, and can avoid increasing road maintenance costs on the other hand. The purpose is nothing more than to develop the transshipment business in the colonies. The first group of transport vehicles was ordered by the Gold Coast government in 1933 to try out some vehicles first. A second group was ordered again the following year, including an eight-wheel tractor. All eight wheels can be turned and carry a load of three tons, and two eight-wheel trailers, each carrying a load of six tons. Therefore, fifteen tons of goods can be loaded on twenty-four light pneumatic tires. The pressure on the ground is much less per square inch than a normal thirty CW seven freight truck. Because of the increased number of wheels, the pressure exerted on the ground by trucks traveling overseas is the lightest with this type of vehicle. All axles are completely independent and direct-acting to reduce the vibration of the vehicle when traveling on the road. As for the trailer, four wheels are in a group, and the two groups of wheels are installed together. Even when they are completely locked, they will not leave the vehicle's ruts.</p>
<p>The second group of vehicles is similar to each other in terms of manufacturing, and the trailer was manufactured by the United Car Factory in accordance with all the instructions given by the Advisory Committee. It uses a diesel engine instead of a car engine. Only the first and fourth wheels can slide, which can reduce a lot of costs in terms of manufacturing and maintenance. The load is the same as the first group, which is also fifteen tons, but if it is on a flat road, the trailer can be increased to eight tons, and the tractor can be increased to four tons. Therefore, three trucks can carry 20 tons of goods. During the trial period, it initially traveled 9,937 miles in central Australia, followed by 550 miles in the south. It went to Olspin in the north, and then to Balden, which is the end of the North Australian Railway. In addition, it has been to several locations. In short, the results of the trial are very satisfactory in everything, and the land that the trial has passed is</p>
