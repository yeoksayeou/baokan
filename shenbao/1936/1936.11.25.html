<p>（北平）此間許多觀察家相信坂垣今日之抵津、及武藤之赴張北、察綏兩省似將因此有迅速之發展、「滿」蒙軍犯綏之企圖、其結果殊使主持此舉者爲之失望、如綏軍克復百靈廟之說、果屬確實、則更將使若輩受一重大打擊無疑、故該省局勢已足發生甚重大之可能性矣、（廿四日路透電）</p>

<p>（天津）關東軍參謀長坂垣、第二課長武藤、第三課長竹下、參謀小野寺少佐等、二十四日午搭機由長飛抵津，下午一鐘到海光寺司令部、晤田代、卽共同召集一軍事重要會議、橋本飯田萱島和知專田淺井塚田河田松室今井濱田等、均參加、關於綏東事件、華北現局、議至下午四時方散、兩軍部已决定一具體新策、俟坂垣廿八日返長時，轉飭各關係者實行、（二十四日專電）</p>
<p>（天津）關內外日方兩軍部、對綏東事觀點微有不同、關外主强硬、華北海軍武官贊成此旨、幷欲籍機建樹功績、華北陸軍部則認有影響經濟開發、宜適可而止、二十四津會議時、曾有詳密討論、仍以權限關係、主硬論者戰勝、（二十四日專電）</p>

<h3>李滋羅斯演說　盛稱我國復興　希望樹立憲政以保安定　中國繁榮足解日經濟困難</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英政府首席經濟顧問李滋羅斯爵士、今日在帝國恊會午餐席上、發表演說、專論中國現狀、並對於蔣委員長表示欽仰、其言曰、「蔣氏處理政局、已證明爲第一流政治家、余信中國輿論、擁護現政府甚力、雖有種稱絕大困難當前、仍能於連年內戰之後、不藉外力、而復興中國、其功績實至偉大、吾人或能希望蔣氏所領導之政府、能長此繼續存在、俾可鞏固行政機關、並進而樹立憲政制度、以維持日後國家之安定、</p>
<p>李氏續稱、彼七日間離中國時、正有各種黯淡之預言、盛傳於人口、但事實上各事皆順利過去、外匯已維持至穩定之境、而毫無困難、晋省之共匪、業已竄入深山、因走私而造成之損失、已有相當限制、西南風雲亦已完全打消、國民政府之權力已遍達全國、世人之游歷歐洲紛亂之區者、已不忍再稱中國秩序之亂、更甚於歐洲、須知中國擁有如此衆多之人口、按照其現狀、實已又稱爲平靖、目下中國大部份皆可安全貿易、毫無阻碍、李氏又述及過去五年來、中國政府一切改革及發展之神速、如公路鐵道之修築、以及法制之改進、均値得世人之法意、故目下之危險、不在中國進步之太遲、而實在其企圖進展之過速、</p>
<p>李氏對於中國貨幣改革之成功、極加讚許、並謂中國現在國際賬册內、或可居債權人地位矣、中國貨幣改革、現時尙須有一事辦到、卽可稱爲完備、卽中央銀行之改組是也、李氏又云、彼以爲中國政府之工作、已入正軌、發展貿易之基本條伴、現已露其端倪、中國淸償鐵路借欵、實爲正策、蓋籍此可使他人繼續以貸欵中國、此實爲發展鐵路建築之正當辦法、</p>
<p>李氏對於　寇爾柏脫利克被任爲英國輸出　信用擔保局駐華代表、深慶得人、並鄭重聲明、英國之輸出擔保、並非一種津貼、實嚴格限於商業方面、且爲信用危險之保障、李氏相信中國之主要危機、實在外來政治糾紛、並引述英外相艾登十一月五日在下院所發表之言論、卽中日間之緊張、已有明顯趨於和緩之確徵、尙望以前緊張局面、能免再見是也、</p>
<p>爵士繼述　及兩次遊日經過曰、「吾人對日本之困難、自當深表同情、其困難與吾人所遭遇者甚相同、卽維持龐大之人口是也、日本主要實業家中、現有一種日見增高之趨勢、承認其本國之困難、半由於出產過量、半由於日人自己之競爭、故主張統制出產與輸出　貿易之運動、現呼聲日高、日人一日承認吾人　不能容許外人推倒吾英之實業、則吾人亦一日不願　增强日人之經濟困難、吾人今切望能覔得一種英日　合作之諒服」、</p>
<p>爵士結語曰、「余對於中國、確抱樂觀、余覺中國繁榮與穩固之發展、有助於日本解除其經濟困難、實較任何事爲大、余相信此節刻漸在日本實現中、將來必有一日、吾人能協同與中政府合作、以推進中國之復興事業」云、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>日武官雨宮談　日浪人參加匪偽軍　任憑中國軍自由處分　日商私運武器中國可自由取締</h3>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本龐大軍事預算的裏面</h3>
<p>]</p>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>日本明年度的預算。已經由大藏省於二十二日編成。將於二十七日提交閣議通過。這次大藏省編成的明年度預算總額。共達三十億四千萬圓之巨。較昭和十一年度實行預算總額。又增七億三千萬圓。實日本歷史上空前未有的大預算在這巨額預算中。海陸軍費的支出。當然佔極大的一部分。共計十四億圓。較本年膨脹三億五千圓。其中陸軍支出佔七億二千圓。海軍佔六億八千圓。</p>
<p>這次的龐大預算。在二十七日的閣議中。大致可順利地通過。卽在將來議會中。也不難順利地通過。卽使議會有什麼的反對。也沒有用處。因爲在軍部勢力影響下的廣田內閣。是可以解散議會。的過去的歷史。就是一個最妥適的解釋。</p>
<p>日本的國防預算。是每年增加的。這增加的原因是什麽呢。用一句簡單的話來說。是日帝國主義的積極準備參加世界大戰。從九一八事件以後。日本是早以戰鬥的武士熊度出現於世界舞台之上了。這八年以來。更以我們的飯土。做他們的軍事演習塲。這是就一般的方面。說明日本國防費不斷增加的原因。至明年度龐大國防費的支出。如果分析起來。則有下面的三種關係。</p>
<p>第一。是日本在華軍事勢力的擴展。從日本佔領東省以後。日本陸軍費的支出就每年增加。尤其是所謂滿洲事件費的支出。增加更甚。這一年來。日本又派遺大批的軍隊增駐華北。並準備繼續的擴充。如最近在綏遠的活動就是一例。這些軍事勢力的擴展。自然需要很大的軍費。將來預算中也許還有「華北事件費」的支出。也說不定哩。</p>
<p>其次。是華盛頓海軍條約與倫敦海軍條約的廢止。日本將大規模的擴充海軍戰備。華盛頓與倫敦兩個海約。都在今年年底滿期。日本已先於去年宣布廢除。不再繼續。而倫敦的海軍會議。又因日本的退出而無結果。因此從明年起。日本的海軍力就可不受條約的束縛。而得大事擴充了。這又非需要巨額的軍事費不可。</p>
<p>最後。是日德同盟的成立。在過去一二年中。日德同盟的消息已不知傳過多少次。但到最近這同盟才正式成立。日德同盟成立後。日本的對蘇軍事準備。自須更形加緊。這樣在將來德日的反蘇戰爭。中日本才能負起一部的責任。因爲對蘇軍事準備的加緊。軍事費的支出也就大增了。</p>
<p>我們不論日本國防費的增加。是由於那一種的原因。但其結果都與我們民族解放的前途。有極重大的關係。這是誰也明白而不容我們忽視的。</p>

<h3>魚雷炸巡艦案　英法人士注意　不干涉委員會　討論監察計劃</h3>
<p>（倫敦）西班牙政府軍所屬巡洋艦塞房蒂號、日昨在西班牙東南部迦泰根港口、穴然發生爆炸、此間政界人士、對於此事極爲關心、據西班牙駐英國大使館發表消息、該艦爆炸、係由不明國籍之潛艇或驅逐艦、施放魚雷所致、此間接到直布羅陀港英國海軍當局報吿、所稱亦與上項消息相符、蒲爾哥斯城國軍當局雖稱、該艦係被國民軍潛水艇所擊中、然國民軍僅有潛艇一艘、故此說殊難徴信、一般人以爲外國潛水艇或驅逐艦之說、比較可信云、（廿三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）此問今日得悉、德意二國如確曾以潛艇「借」給西班牙叛軍、攻擊政府軍巡艦塞房蒂號、則法國將要求華盛頓海軍條約簽字國一致注意、此係直接違反該約之舉動云、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）名記者聖蒲里士頃在日報就西班牙政府軍巡洋艦寨房蒂號被潛水艇襲擊一事、有所評論、略云、「意大利旣欲在地中海上與英國互相接近、按之華盛頓海約第十八條所載規定、意國在此約滿期之前、卽一九三七年一月一日之前、又不得以軍艦售予他國、（按第十八條規定、各締約國承認、不用贈予販賣或其他轉讓方式、處分任何軍艦、致使該艦成爲他國海軍之軍艦、）似此、「塞房蒂號在迦泰根港外被潛水艇襲擊之事、實屬奇特之至、猶憶美國巡洋艦前於一八九八年二月十五日緬因號、曾在哈伐那港發生爆炸、因而沉沒、當卽引起美國與西班牙國之戰事、「塞房蒂號其爲緬因號之第二歟」云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）西班牙內亂不千涉辦法調整委員會所設小組委員會、頃淤本日午後開會、討論西班牙內戰當事雙方轄境內港口邊界及各飛機塲之監察計畫、其中關於各飛機塲之監察辦法、甫經若千國家駐英航空參贊，草定計畫、本日出席小組委員會各國代表、决定將此項計畫、分送各該國政府核閱、英國蘇聯及其他數國代表當主張先將港口及邊界之監察計畫、立卽送交瑪德里與蒲爾哥斯雙方當局、但意大利·德國·葡萄牙三國代表、則加以拒絕、謂應俟全部監察計畫完成之後、始乃送交西班牙內戰常事雙方、小組委員會、現定於本月二十七日繼續開會，决定此事、大多數國家代表、對於德意葡三國所採立塲、印象頗爲不佳、以爲依照三國所提主張、監察制度之實施、勢必爲之延遲一般人亦以爲港口及邊境之監察計畫、現若送交西班牙內戰當事雙方、則國民軍總司令弗朗哥將軍、勢必加以拒絕、若然、其所處地位自不免受歐洲輿論之指摘、今因德意葡三國反對之故、監察計畫、不必由國民軍拒絕、而無形中、業已延遲實施矣、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>本市文化界、學界律師界李公樸·鄒韜奮·章乃器。王造時·沈鈞儒沙千里·及女律師史艮、均以有鼓動工潮嫌疑、經常局令由市公安局密派探員、於二十二日夜半、會同英法兩租界捕房中西探、一併逮捕、翌晨、分解江蘇高等法院第二第三兩分院提審之下、裁定將李等交給各該辯護律師保出、展期、二十五日下午續審在案</p>

<h3>絲銷驟盛價格飛漲　滬各絲廠原料告罄　已不及一月之需停工者踵起　繭價已超過絲價餘繭商居奇</h3>
<p>華絲價格飛漲、外銷驟增後、滬各絲廠原料吿罄、繭價高漲不止、各廠停工者踵起、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>銷路驟盛價格飛漲</p>
<p>歐美市塲華絲銷路驟盛、以致價格飛漲、駐滬各外商洋行、如達昌連納等行、均鉅量買進、同時國內因農產品豐收、人民購買力轉强、各絲織廠日夜開工織綢、所以用戶絲銷大增、至目前截止、華絲價格、以標準B字等級計算、（一）外銷每担合華幣七百九十元、（二）國內用戶每担爲國幣七百七十元、</p>
<p>原料告罄停工踵起</p>
<p>華絲國內外銷路驟盛後、江·浙·兩省各絲廠及絲號存絲大减、各絲廠均開工繅絲、大有求過於供之趨勢、惟原料均發生缺乏恐慌允以上海各絲廠爲最盛、開工之積餘·恒蒼等四十八家絲廠、先後因原料吿罄、已宣吿停工者、計有紹興恒泰復昶源記等八九家、</p>
<p>繭價高漲超過絲價</p>
<p>至於上海存繭、爲數有限、已不足供給各廠一個月之需、所以俟過陽歷年底後開工各廠、勢必完全無原料可繅而停工、關於繭價各餘繭商、均因奇貨可居、不願出售、以致互相抬高、上等繭子每担已高至一百八十五元、如以四百斤繅折計算、則每四担繭子繅絲一担、其成本須七百四十元、外加繅工及一切開支的八十元、則每繅絲一祖、成本爲八百二十元、所以各廠如買繭繅絲、勢必虧耗、</p>
<h3>秦聯奎等建議　募集防毒面具</h3>

<h3>崇啟地權問題　　移轉崇人在啟地權　崇明同鄉誓死力爭</h3>
<p>自崇啟兩縣合治後、崇人發動之分治運動、懸案尙未解决、而啟東人士又有移轉崇人在啟東地權之舉、呈請省方實行、茲事關係甚大、一旦實行、崇明業戶勢將流爲白俄、故紛紛反對、崇明旅滬人士、亦正集議有效辦法、共謀對付、茲將上海社記者探誌詳情如次、</p>
<p>啟束地租情形</p>
<p>啟東原爲崇明隸屬之外沙、至民國十七年、省府接受啟人之請、始分縣、卽名爲今之啟東、全啟耕地的計九十　萬餘畝、以史的關係、大半地權爲崇明業主所有、的佔百分之六十左右、由當地佃農耕種、每年地租上田每畝三元、中田二元五角、下田一元弱、由崇人往啟收取、向爲慣例、惟自啟東立縣以後、啟東縣政府苛收地稅、並以治權不統一、當地農民時有暴動之舉、故事實上崇明業戶、已蒙分縣之苦、屢經該縣耆紳王淸穆等向行政院呼籲分治、懸案迄未解决、</p>
<p>發動土地革命</p>
<p>該縣縣黨部常務委員周儒謙、與解除崇啟糾紛起見、呈請省政府移轉崇人在啟地權、省府以茲事體大、故會飭第四區行政督察專員公署、召集二縣縣政府、縣黨部、及有關各機關代表詳加討論、經由該署於本月十日召集會議一次、因崇人堅持反對、未有結果、</p>
<p>移運地權簡則</p>
<p>由啟東縣黨部縣政府會同聘任地方公正人士、組織栘轉崇人在啟地權委員會、專爲計劃一切移轉事宜、着手調查崇人地權、地質分上田中田下田　等、移轉地權分等給予地價券、付息領價地價券、崇人所有在啟田租、由移轉地權會負責徵收、所收租欵除山會繳納田賦、及地價券息金外、悉數充作地價券還本基金、還本决序抽籤定之、地價券息全年計六厘、上田每畝　元、中田七元五角、下田六元、一律給予地價券、分六年拔還、</p>
<p>旅　同鄕反對</p>
<p>自此事發生後引起崇人之熱烈反對、認爲一旦實行、崇明業主勢成白俄無二、旅滬同鄕童行白等、亦曾一度開會討論、進行步驟、力請省府愼重處理、茲崇明旅滬學會陳東白·楊震中·施翵鵬·童慕葛。陸蔭初·許佩行。朱亞揆等、亦認爲此舉缺乏理論根據、集議堅决反對、上海社記者並以此事就詢於熟悉土地制度之學者、據云、依照總理「耕者有其田」之主張、對地價應由業主自動報價、今該縣所定地價、非由地主自報、實行恐屬困難云、</p>

<p>申報國貨專刊寫給家庭訪員的幾句話  平夫　　這一次，滬市國貨運動聯合會，招考家庭訪員五名，其舉動實令人可佩；而應考之女士，尤令人欽佩萬分，因為在現今的中國，不論是一件什麽事情，在民眾沒有正式受到它的利益以前，他們都不會給一個好印象，這話說來，亦不無理由，緣近年來，社會之上，欺騙之事，頻頻不絕，民眾已因騙而懼，故凡事生疑，因而，家庭訪員實際工作時，難免要受打擊，然而，她們能不避困難，為國家服務，爲家庭服務，自抱奮勇，來擔負起這件困難工作，怎不令人感佩！　　固然，一件事初次做來，感到棘手，不過亦因人而論，倘對人對事，能應付裕如，自可進行順利，謹將筆者想到幾點，貢獻於家庭訪員：　　碰壁，上面已說過，這是在所難免的事，因人性不同，難加揣摸，就如前幾天我地有一商號之夥友，中途遺失大批貨物，消息傳到一位記者耳中，即急訪問，意在調查確實，而主人卻態度傲慢，對於所問，顱頭不對馬嘴，不予正當答覆，結果快快而歸。倘這類之人，社會上並不少見；本來，一個莫不相干的人，到在他人家裏，難免要碰壁，不過家庭訪員，決不能因而灰心，倘一灰心，則不但有礙事情之發展，並對後進之人，亦有莫大影響，谚云：「」失敗乃成功之母」，此話頗恰，筆者謹以至誠獻給家庭訪員。　　印象，也是一件很關重要的事情，倘家庭主婦對於自己印象不佳，就是立論多麼恰當，實用，也難獲得家庭主婦之信用，此正如一對摩登夫婦，一著西服革履，一燙髮著高跟鞋，一同深入農村，宣傳救國，結果不但不能收預期之效力，必遭鄉民之反感，所以，家庭訪員，對於這點，不能不加注意，比如服裝樸素，舉動要莊嚴，言語要誠懇……都是很要緊的條件。　　其餘，口才也是一件很重要的事情，比如口吃容易使人討厭，說話快使人聽不清楚……都不能收到效果：口白的清楚，固然是很重要，可是還必須要沉著謹慎，每一個字，都要送到對方的耳朵裏，同時，對於所講的失物，也要它與趣化，使對方聽了一句，還要側著耳朵聽下一句，這才能收到真正的效果。　　另外，信用更關重要，因為言語與實際不相吻合，以後即永不能獲得家庭主婦的信用，同時。對於國貨的前途，也有莫大關係，所以，家庭訪員，對於此點，不能不加注意！　　上列幾點，筆者隨時想到，寫了出來，獻給家庭訪員，至希採納！婦女服用國貨會成立感言  影呆　　最近我們知道上海的婦女界成立了一個婦女服用國貨會，這當然是一個可喜的消息，何消說你加入這個服用國貨會的女同胞，決心從今而後，無論個人方面，家庭方面，服用所需的東西都要購買國貨了。　　好吧？現在上海的都市之中，有一部份知識婦女，知道婦女界老是愛用洋貨，中國的金錢，無限止的在流向外國，前途是很可怕的。因此，他們發起組織一個婦女服用國貨會，而且這個提倡國貨的團體，已於本月十一日成立了，加入的會員，目前有二三百人之多。她們當然每一個都決心從今而後，所需用的服用物品，完全要買國貨的，對於洋貨，不再購買絲毫。　　提倡國貨服用國貨的團體，單是在上海這一個都市之中，近幾年來也不知成立多少了，但這一次婦女服用國貨會的成立，我們覺得格外的要為國貨界前途慶倖。唯一的原因，就是婦女為家庭中的中心人物，一切服用的東西，購買之權，多半操在婦女之手。一個主婦，一方面自己經手購買的東西，完全採用國貨，另一方面對於自己的丈夫或兒女，有人要購買洋貨決不再會進門口了；所以實行服用國貨，如果由每一個家庭中的主婦來作為領導，那比較要有效果得多。　　不過我們如果想到這次加入婦女服用國貨會的女同胞，總共祗二三百人，在全上海的婦女界中，這個數字，還是少數中的少數，那麼目前已加入的會員，不但自己要服用國貨，而且還要努力徵求會員，勸戒別的婦女一致服用國貨，那麼才能收得比較切實而偉大的效果，所以每一個會員所負責的使命可不小呢？貫獻話國貨工廠應有的檢討  仰葊　　國貨在今日，總算惹人歡喜，到處風行，做到各方一致擁戴的地位了，可是國貨工業界本身，先得自己切實的檢討一下，檢討什麽？　　第一，檢討所有的出品，是否比較以前有進步，倘使沒有進步，原因在那裏？　　第二，檢討所辦的工業，對於技術上有沒有改進的地步，關於技術人才的羅致與培植，已否注意於此？　　第三，檢討所用的原料，有沒有國產，倘使沒有國產原料，已否準備？如果用的是外國原料，以後該怎樣的救濟。　　第四，檢討所有的出品，是否達到標準化的目的。各項出品，能夠滿足用戶的意思，客家定貨時，能否適合他們的需要。　　第五，檢討所有的出品，已否能準期交貨，交出的貨，是否與貨樣相符。是否能得到各方的贊許。　　第六，檢討所有出品的價格，能否用比較人家可以減低？逢到供不應求時，有否高抬貨價的惡習，以灰愛用國貨之人土的信心。　　第七，檢討所有出品，有沒有「掛羊頭賣狗肉」的伎倆，以靳喪國家前途的生命。　　國貨工業家於此，宜仔細檢討，有則改之，無則加勉。提倡國貨原料  怡怡館主　　年來國人，提倡國貨，可謂「不遺餘力。」但是，我覺得大家只有知道提倡國貨，而對於國貨的原料，卻很少有人注意。這不能謂非「捨本逐末，」實在是提倡國貨的一件滑稽的事情！　　因為，如果國貨的原料，是採自國外的。那麼，這所謂「國貨，」「名存實亡！」表面上是國貨，不過因為它是國內工廠的出品，而實際上，它的原料，卻是「舶來品！」這一點利權，依然是外溢。這樣地提倡國貨，甯非滑稽？在下想到了這，便不由的寫了這一篇。希望大家提倡國貨，同時還要提倡國貨原料！一週間國貨新訊　　中華工業總聯合會於二十一日舉行九屆會員大會。　　南洋商業考察團團長高事恒副團長胡士澄秘書楊崇阜聯訣於二十二日晉，向政府報告，並獻杖於吳實長。　　實部籌設國貨聯合營業公司滬代表到京接洽圓滿，日內著手籌辦。　　國際貿易局試辦特產國內運銷，注意國際宣傳，及直接貿易。　　財部核准江南醋酸廠，仲明木炭代油燈，開成公司硫鐵礦，中國汽車公司零件四家出品，各免轉口稅三年。春秋點滴  （戴中新）　　迎接和歡送，不知犧牲了多少精神，浪費了多少時間，靡費了多少金錢！　　深夜恭候在車站上，是多麼可憐？…越是要人越是喜歡乘夜車。　　誰又知道小職員們守候大人先生的苦衷？　　接風也不過是花掉些錢吃吃罷了，這風原是接不著握不住的呀！　　在群眾面前，歡呼著，鬧著，又算什麽？　　走便走了，又多談什麽？　　手帕兒發狂似　　揚著，這樣不怕手酸，不怕風吹，真是何苦呢？　　看見人家登輪去了，又是傷心，又是氣憤。　　爲什麽重有人會苦苦拉著人家去歡迎那些素未謀面的要人？　　爲什麽迎接要人有時是偷偷摸摸的？　　候著了要人，跟在後面出來，是榮是辱？　　爲什麽許許多多去迎接人家的學生們，連歡迎誰也沒有知道？　　朝秦暮楚的局勢，迎接了又歡送，歡送了又迎接，永遠是小職員們的晦氣！冷和溫暖  陳亮　　漸漸地，我歡喜在有太陽的半邊走路了。一種可愛的溫暖循脊樑下注，直達腿足，血脈流轉得和緩而舒暢，一種自然界的光和熱，正如愛人的耳語，慈母的笑容，那般令人從心坎中發出無量數的感激。　　也不知道從那天起，對於那些沒有太陽照到的路的半邊，發生了深切的憎惡。在同一條路上，雖沒有磚牆，也沒有銳刺的鐵欄，來劃分出兩個不同的境域。但是，一邊是陰暗，一邊是光亮，一邊是冷，一邊是溫暖。我和其餘的路人一樣，愛光亮和溫暖，而憎惡陰暗和冷酷。　　這足見不是我使人的偏愛和偏憎了。　　天一冷，在大街上便很少有人在沒有陽光的地方走著或息足，做小生意的都把攤子換了方向。老太婆和大姑娘在太陽光下做些手工，連「癟三」之流也揀在有太陽的牆角邊坐下捫白虱擦項垢了。　　我是素秉陽處一的人，交進冬季，手足便失去了溫暖，因此遇到熱人，不敢學歐派行握手禮，免使那些熱誠的朋友受到冷的刺激。記得有一位詩人跟一位女友握手，女友驚異的說：「怎麼你的手這般冷呵！」詩人急加以解釋道：「小姐，我的手冷嗎，可是，我的內心正熱著呢。」這話，便把他和伊殷商引上了初戀的道路。我卻缺乏詩人那般的心境。終屬遺憾。　　好在，也沒有小姐來跟我握手，不必憂慮的。唯一補救手冷的辦法，便是捧茶杯，不一定要喝茶，也不一定要茶就行。在冷漠中，雙手捧著一杯熱騰騰的茶或開水，在書室里躑躅，可以的著柔美的溫暖感，即使是大寒天，亦毋需圍爐，一可避免熾火的薰灼，二可避免中煤毒。　　在冷酷中得着一些溫暖，已算是滿足的人生，像眼前的世態，並不作「雪中送炭」的妄想。假使要我趨炎附勢。甯可還是捧捧熱茶杯吧。拆字攤  惟經　　跳舞，不知怎的，我雖也不能算是十足道地的鄉下人，同時，還不住地受著「不跳舞是落伍」的脅迫，我對之，總沒有發生興趣的可能，雖然我也曾摟抱著舞女的腰肢，飽嗅過舞女的脂粉味，但這已是半年前之事了。在這半年間，我是沒曾施捨過一張舞票，但在每星期六的晚飯之後，除了風雨之夜，我總是在某一家舞場中，擺著拆字攤，這可說是這半年來的喔的新與味。　　在跳舞場中，擺設拆字攤，是伴著一盞清茶，坐而不跳的。自黃昏七八點鐘，坐起，坐上三四個小時，或一直的坐到舞場打烊，均無不可。這樣的擺拆字攤，在「舞場孝子」眼中瞧來，或許是認為太無聊，而且是認為非摩登的，然而以我的經驗瞧來，若能持之以恆，是僅有不少的與味，可以獲得的。我因每週一次的在一個固定的舞臺中觀光，所以對於若干舞女的個性，以有了輪廓的認識。雖然是在同一個紅燈綠酒的環境之中討生活，我是能從伊們的行動舉止上面，斷定著伊們出身的高下。從若干方面的傳說，已能證明著我的猜測的無訛。因為其中一個，並不能怎麼受人歡迎的舞女，我所認為是好人家兒女的，據說，是一個孝廉公約女兒。但是伊怎會淪為舞女呢？這是我心中，覺得最繫念的一個啞謎，　　舞女，是忙得那麼的分不開身來。坐冷板凳的舞女，整整的一個黃昏，除了屢屢的出入於馬桶間，以資活動之外，是難得有所行動的。但是不拘是紅舞女，或是坐冷板凳的，卻都是跳不出一個共通的公式，那便是最多三個月，便不再出現於這舞場上了。因為紅的，或許是給別個舞場聘去了。坐冷板凳的，或許是脫下了高跟鞋，找腳踏實地的生活去了。所以在舞女國中，是不絕地有陌生面孔出現著的，惟有那些中等的舞女，才是舞場中堅儘有守至半載一年之上的。　　伴着一盞清茶，坐在幽霧也似的燈光之下，大可以瞧得舞海沉浮的種種。同時，更可以瞧得紳士舞客的姿態，揩油舞客的賊頭狗腦，以及處於拖車地位者的討好舞女的殷勤。種種可歌，可泣，可笑，亦復可憐的一切，都可滿足著旁觀者的刺激的需要。因此，我覺得擺拆字攤，是別有風味的生活之一種。假肚  拾玖　　「不孝有三，無後為大。」自從孟老夫子定下這句鐵律以後，數千年來，國人莫不視傳種接代為唯一大事。男子們更有借此作護身符，而大妻其侍妾，以飽那肉欲的。所謂「大丈夫三妻四妾，何足為奇，」至今口頭中常說到此種奇論。至婦女們呢，有的自己肚裏不爭氣，生不出一個男娃娃來，飽受翁姑等白眼，已覺有苦難說：何況「良人者，所仰望而終身者也，」良人因傳種娶妾，那末伊們的終身，向誰託付呢！問問送子觀音，送子觀音一言不發；於是攻心計的婦女們，遂有裝假肚之事。　　甲男乙女，結嫡已久，並且膝下兩位小姐亦已亭亭玉立；現在男女平等，似乎不能說「無後」了。然而甲男心中還常有所不足。因不足而生野心，自是意中之事；於是蓄妾之心遂怦怦動。對乙前，初不過用旁敲則擊之法；既知無效，乃時於飯罷酒後長噓短嘆，謂箕裘克绍，終成虛願，而乙女仍不睬，無何，甲男我出外就職了。乙女乃心生一計，特裝假肚。裝假肚的法兒，據說再腰間縛一個特製的大搭膊，中盛以綠豆殼，逐漸增加，至像十月懷胎時止。那個胎兒則是半夜向某育嬰機關抱來的代價十元。自是乙女振振有詞，快函男報喜哩，雇奶媽哩，開湯餅宴哩，真如諺語所謂「像煞有介事，」有誰知之呢？　　那末甲男如何？甲男的了喜訊，本也無所謂喜。原來有后無後，他滿不在乎；他只想娶妾，娶妾，滿足他的肉欲，而乙女遂終無如之何。嚮導員（續）  王瑜　　這倒不是一件容易的工作，當客人在途中有什麽詢問，都得用英語詳細的回答。客人的興趣當然是各不相同的；有的就喜歡逛馬路，有的一心想瞧瞧我們的京戲，更有喜吃中國菜的，或是到跳舞場酒排間去，倘若有誰歡喜玩女人的，他也會把你帶到鹹水妹家去，或是到東洋堂子，或是找羅宋女人，因為那些妓女們是另有好處給嚮導員的。　　直等到客人感到滿意地說要回去了，他還得用汽車親自送到你原來的船上，於是嚮導員就要伸手向這客人要錢了。特寫一個女職員的一天生活  王莎葩　　張小姐，是某機關裏的一個女職員，論伊每月的薪水，祗不過法幣三十元，除去了飛機捐二角，所得稅五分，實收僅二十九元七角五分，可是看伊身上的衣裳，和化裝品裝飾品等等，非得一百元不可，因為伊的旗袍，不是二天換一件，便是三天換一件，而且都是非常新式的，有時候，還得換換西服，當然：手錶，高跟鞋，電燙的頭髮，那是不必說得，眼鏡，手套，是伊的寶貝，所以伊常說：這區區三十塊錢的薪水，給我剪一次衣料也不夠哪！　　伊最早，每天得九點鐘起身，雖然伊服務的機關，規定九點鐘簽到辦公，但伊不管，在家裏洗臉，先得化去半個鐘頭，吃半碗粥，換衣服，休息，又得半個鐘頭，等到搭車上辦公室，辦公室門口的電鐘，已十點一刻，但伊在簽到的簿上，照例寫「張××九時」，這，還是伊高興，要是不高興的話，呌聽差打個電話給主任，說張小姐今天有事情請假，不來了。伊進辦公室，第一步便是按電鈴，呌茶房絞手巾擦臉，擦過臉之後，又喝一杯茶，茶喝完，便得上女廁所小便。小便回來，然後掏鑰匙開抽屜辦公，等到伊東翻翻，西翻翻，拿起筆杆兒搖了幾搖，外面，已在搖退值鈴了。　　下午，一點鐘辦公，伊上辦公室之後，又得照例擦手巾，喝茶，上女廁所，伊和女廁所是最親密不過的，平均每隔一小時，總的去一次，所以在退值之前的半小時，伊還得溜一溜，溜好出來，便把錢包披肩預備，等到鈴一響好開步走了。　　晚飯以後，在家裏的無線電是真難得的，不是舞場，便是影戲院，總得鬧到十二點以後，才肯回家睡覺。換巢鸞鳳  張恨水著　　第八回　杯水盟心青燈話憔悴　勾金約指紅豆報相思　　請你告訴他，用自己佩帶的東西送人，生平還是第一次。友梅道：還有別的話嗎，夢蘭對於帶戒指的那個無名指，便有了一番依依不捨的狀態，只是將另一隻手的食指來撫摸著。友梅道：那麼，我走了，改天再見罷。夢蘭默然看了他將戒指拿了走去。這戒指藏在友梅身上，總有四十八小時之久，他還想不出一個辦法，應當怎樣的交到國器手上去。自己是一位姑娘，根本就不便替人傳帶信物。第二，國器為人，面皮最薄，在未說明情形以前，突然把這戒指送給他，他是很受窘的。最後他忽然一想，既答應了給人做事，就當做去。只要居心光明磊落，又害什麽羞？有了這麼一個轉念，就找了一個洋式小信封。將戒指封著。然後一人看到章家來。這日中午，恰是章老太睡了午覺，走到天井裏靜悄悄的，沒有一點聲息。看看國器窗戶外懸的那綠竹簾子，被風吹得微微的擺蕩著。天井裏那棵小樹，在青苔地上，作了一個小小的圓陰影。友梅呌了一聲姑母，國器立刻在屋子裏答道：李小姐請進來坐罷。說著，他被了夏布長衫走到堂屋來，元自扣著紐扣。友梅道：老太太睡了午覺了嗎？國器點頭道：是的。友梅道：那我就不用進去吵他了。說到這裏，顏色正了一正道：我有一個同學，很欽佩你的才學，大概表兄很明白。我和他是種好的朋友，可以說是患難相共。所以他又什麽事，是不瞞我的。他也知道我們是親戚，讬我帶一樣東西交給你。至於詳細的話，他一定有信通知你的。（一〇二）遊踪所至鄭成功故里巡禮  蘭人　　民族英雄鄭成功，可以說是一個蓋世的豪傑，在如虎如狼的胡清的鐵蹄下，立志恢復明室，舟師出沒，縱橫無敵，至其去死，不過三十五歲的年齡，這樣一位青年英雄，在這個國難嚴重的今日，真值得我們的景仰呵！　　鄭成功原名霖，明唐王賜姓朱改名成功，封忠孝伯，人因稱國姓爺。他是福建南安縣石井鄉人。石井的得名，據說在白鶴山下有一個天然的石井，泉味甘美，其旁有一石成仙鶴狀，俯啄飲其中，是石井鄉的名勝之一，而石井即以名鄉了。在晉朝的時候，還沒有這一個村莊，到了唐朝，見許多百姓到了那裏，大概都以打漁為生，因此集合成道一個村落。明朝設立多百姓到了那裏，大概都以打漁為生，因此集合成道一個村落。明朝設立了巡司，清末駐有大盈的汎官，因為是南安縣海口的村落，風景十分美麗，簡直難以形容，不妨述之如左。　　石井前臨馬江，馬江的得名，是因為江裏有一塊石，宛然馬狀，故名。江景的幽遠，漁人的往來，都如圖畫。在村的周圍，有十二峯，地勢傾斜，遠望之，如飛燕掠江然。其他如鱷石山，白鶴山，煙樓山，戰兢山，牛嶺，楊子山等，都是遠遠近近很有名的去處。在鰲石山下，有所謂猴洞者，樹木清幽，非塵世地，這地方建設了延平公園。又　鄭成功的故壘，名铳城，只有一個城門，其他已經顯頹了。據志謂，這是戚繼光防倭寇所建。說是鄭公約故壘，恐怕是纏誤的吧，又縣承可倭寇奏凱處，是在煙樓山上，泉州府誌鄭普平寇記稱山為墩台，是敗寇的地方。　　靖海門在十字街，旁邊又平臺碑記。後人改名為忠節，較原名減色不少。可惜這座碑的字跡，已經非常模糊了。　　石井還有八景，頗有名！一，五馬朝江；二，揚子晚照；三，鯉魚吐珠；四，屈鶴飲泉；五，碧莎環帶；六，雙陽華表；七，雙龍渡海；八，紫帽呈案；　　石井原是巨村，村民業漁，不少人都到南洋群島去過活，清朝遷界時，石井曾發生大變動，地方成了一個荒墟。現在掘地時，還不時發見墻基。村民姓鄭的最多，次者姓許為伍，合計其他，也不下無錢人左右，各地都手石井以鄭伍居大姓。　　鄭成公死後，還物有玉帶，及和董妃并的遺像，這楨畫像，外面傳繪或攝影者不少，至其墓，在南安覆船山，離石井約二十里之譜。大家都呼為：「延平王墓」。　　在鰲石山下。有鄭氏祠堂，裏面除供奉歷代祖先木主外，鄭芝龍，成功，克經，塽的木主均在，屋共兩進，現住日本大使許世英先生在其民國四年閩省長任內，曾題一聯如下：東海重澎臺，風景不殊，舉目有河山之異；南天留祠宇，雄闊雖渺，稱名則婦孺皆知。　　現祠旁建延平王專祠，更顯得偉大了。我寫本文竟，覺得福建現在的局面，幾乎成了一個漢奸的世界，想鄭公泉下有知，當亦死不瞑目吧！</p>

<p>康健之路  康健醫藥社主編根據最新學理及臨床試驗的：　淋病療法之進一步認識  陸軍醫大畢業宋忠鈺　醫師　　用披砂煉金的方法找出絕不平庸的治療　　從許多患者的結果看起來，淋病實在是花柳病中的一種險惡症候，它的轉歸多半是不良的。據我的考察，這也是因為淋病向來沒有特效療法，而有些製劑簡直還有莫大的弊害！　　這裏面的講究，大多患者在初起時，為着尿道灼熱，刺痛難堪，巴不得馬上得到仙丹妙藥，立刻治愈；於是胡亂的服一陣淋藥，不管是否藥不對症抑有害，這乃是常見的事！　　其實初起的急性淋病，其淋菌尚在尿道內，如果能施以感應性的特殊療法，即可根本治愈。這時倘服以非正式的製劑，或行透膜殺菌治療，反會將淋菌誘入後尿道的生殖器組織內，以致發生攝護腺炎，精囊及睾丸腫脹他如膀胱炎，腎臟炎等，均屬後尿道疾患。治愈婦女受丈夫傳染得了淋毒，便會使子宮陰道炎爛，赤白帶下。到了最後，淋病不論男女，都有發生會致殘廢的關節炎之可能。而白帶及睾丸腫脹，必致終身滅絕子嗣其平日的痛苦也非常多！本來，淋菌一侵犯後尿道（即急性轉慢性時），其足跡早就散佈到血液當中，流到週身四肢百骸，所以患淋病者常有身體疼痠之感，一旦併發骨膜膿痬及心膜炎，便要發生性命的危險了不可妄治依我二十餘年來的臨床研究，我在許多淋藥中，切實證明了蛋白體黃色素合製劑「克林儂」確為上述男女各種淋病的特效藥，功能減除全身各部病菌，故服後永遠根治。但婦女白帶宜並用「卡而雪地」外治。同時可用藥水洗滌陰道。查最近新發明之「抗淋水」Antt　Gonococci-Aqva乃專供男女兩用外部洗注尿道之藥液，依說明書施行，每日洗射一二次，即見放尿暢利，小便澄清。同時內服「克林儂」以清除淋菌，那好起來更其快速啊！內分泌罷工　內分泌機能障礙與性的不能  南通醫科大學畢業武鐘麟醫師　　因手淫激起性組織的機構失常　等於資本家苛待勞工而起罷工　　我們人的生活，等於一個社會，假如社會上有不健全的地方——那末，社會的病態，也就即刻出現了。現在上海罷工的風潮，日事澎湃，原因自然出於勞資雙方的待遇不平。但是我們人體的內分泌機能失常，也等於社會上組織的破壞。正在發育途中。因外界之引誘，與體內之刺戟，釀成手淫惡癖。將青春腺分泌機能，且旦而犯。致失去正確之分泌工作，等於內分泌機能之罷工。而病百出矣。如遺精，早洩，陰莖勃起力不緊，血行障礙，呈貧血，顏色枯槁。頭痛失眠，讀書過目即忘等，而下部發育不全，尤為手淫及房事過度者，恒見之症象。　　此等症状，既因手淫損失荷爾蒙而起致青春腺失常。故德國Karmlam博士常說，處理青春腺系疾患之有效處置，無過於德國梅倫氏所發明之「補體康」。此藥係用勇壯動物荷爾蒙所製成。服後在短期中發生如下之輸送，得在各器官，尤其是性器官獲得此項荷爾蒙補給，生機重萌，遺精早洩諸症全愈。於是所患既除。神經衰弱，如失眠健忘等，均可治愈。我自南通醫科大學畢業後，迭用「補體康」治愈許多青年發育不全之病，如一方姓少年，在十五歲時即　　手淫，故發育不全。後其　　又偪令早婚，故又有遺精早洩，勃起不能之病狀。夫婦感情冰炭，後囑向五洲藥房服「補體康」及「耐而斯遺精片」各三瓶而愈。夫婦感情歡洽，未愈年又獲一子云。淋毒後尿道炎治愈之又一例  姚菊巖醫師　　患者王仲庭君。年廿六歲，常德人。前因一度宿娼，又失於治療，遂轉成後尿道炎，尿意頻數，艱痛異常，每一小時，必小便四五次。每次小便又有零星血點，混雜於淋絮之中。乃用尿道反射鏡之檢查，粘膜紅腫，且有侵入之狀態。（如第一圖）又以小便不能排除凈盡之故，小腹脹痛，有成尿中毒之勞，乃以手術排清後，隨囑內服『克林儂』，外用『抗淋水』在家注射。計前後服用達四星期，小便快利，腫痛全消，更用尿道鏡檢查，則尿道粘膜，已完全恢復原狀矣。（如第二圖）（第一圖）　　未服『克林儂』及外用『抗淋水』時。粘膜炎腫，多成侵蝕狀態。（第二圖）　　服『克林儂』及外用『抗淋水』後，淋毒全消，粘膜腫痛盡去。白帶病之自療談  陳少華醫師　　白帶病，是我們婦女界中很流行的病患。不過因其來勢不兇，所以都不注意牠。又因為以此為，看做隱患，所以不肯到醫師那邊去，於是就這樣放任不去治療，結果，把膣道腐蝕，惡垢愈來愈凶。對於房既有妨害，而於卵巢機能，又易引起障礙。因此月經不調，而招來不孕的主因。又因白帶很多毒性，所以沾染眼內即有失明的危險。　　但據我們的經驗，婦女白帶可在家用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」於臨睡前插入膣道中一片為坐藥。次晨洗去即得。因淋病而來者，可服「克林儂」，用經乖體虛者，可兼服「補女容」姚菊巖醫師淋病講座　　（診所）：四川路甯波路轉角　（診時）：上午十時至下午六時。　　實行堅壁清野之療淋新法　　無孔不入，有隙即乘，此即淋菌活動之真相也。吾人不幸一旦被淋菌所染，初時不過尚處於尿道的前部，治療得當，無不一鼓成擒，然因社會上之患者，大多不知淋病常識。一旦病發，即驚慌失措，於是朝夕憂懼，服藥求醫，毫無主張，故愈演愈兇。如淋毒性攝護腺炎，輸精管炎，精囊炎，睾丸炎，關節炎等，大多由於初期淋病失治後之結果。故醫治之方，以外用電療，及「抗淋水」，作尿道之注射，以扑滅局部之淋菌，同時內服德國「克林儂」使全體細胞，增多抗淋毒素，此種偉大之抗淋毒素，能在淋毒部份，直接起喰菌作用。進而更起包圍所有全部淋菌，實行其堅壁清野殺菌法。在最短期間，收根治之效。　　有住浙江路之周天熙君，年廿七歲，去年患淋病後，以惑於邪說，誤服劣藥，及行不熟練之手術，致成慢性。由攝護腺炎變成睾丸炎，所以右側睾丸腫痛，艱於步履。尿意艱　，時有血絲從小便發見。會陰肛門脹痛特甚。嗣讀余之「性病全書」，即乞余治療，經用科學方法檢查之下，知周君之淋菌，已分佈各處，勢將引起其他變症。乃囑內服「克林儂」以殺菌消炎鎮痛利尿，外用「抗淋水」，囑在家自行在尿道注射。一方仍用長短波電交互治療，在五星期中，即將全部淋疾肅清，其夫人白帶，亦經余指用「克林儂」為內服藥，外用「卡而雪地陰道片」為坐藥，亦於四星期中奏功。周君夫婦曾同時用血清檢查，證明確無淋毒反應。故偕居迄今，亦無病的變態云。肺癆病之預防與救治  日本帝國醫科大學畢業陳敏伯醫師　　兼患神經衰弱者之正確可靠指導　　各國防癆運動，都蓬勃的方興未替，如公共衛生的設施，　報文字的宣傳，都收到了很大的效力。我國人習慣隨地吐痰，又缺乏醫學常識，有肺病的人，也是把痰　隨意吐在地上，以致痰內的癆菌，得着散佈的機會，這也是我國癆病　行的原因。　　所以有肺病的人，最好注重公德，不要任意吐痰。中國現在已有防癆協會的設立，我們希望它能有很好的成績。　　說道肺癆的治療，本就沒有特效藥，不過參照最新學理，予以適當的療法，亦能全愈。　　今日各國醫院中，最風行的療法是外科手術和理學療法，注射已不甚採用。而藥物却尚占重要之位置。雖一面打空氣針及開割肋骨之患者，醫師固仍囑其服以相當藥劑，如鈣劑，臟器製劑，解熱劑，止咳劑，化痰劑等，然均不能直接治癆，故尚屬憾事。　　邇來科學益加進步，肺癆療法竟致奇葩怒放。如「補肺拿爾」一藥之發明，肺癆患者，幾可全無問題矣。　　據我臨床研究，「補肺拿爾」實兼有臟器及鈣劑之長，而無其他製劑流弊。在服後無論如何，　有和外科手術同樣效力，而　清退濕熱，止　止咳，化痰消腫的實效。倘　患腦　失眠遺精等，可並服「　　　」（女用「補女容」）自佳。女性的兩重奏  俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師　　少似觀音　壯似猴精　　一個人對生理上時時有變動。在　期間，尤其是對於女子變化最大，例如正在發育的女子，她因為內分泌機能之變故，卵巢成熟，月經來潮，脂肪充實，肌肉細膩，兩頰紅潤而豐腴，呈露出一副動人的嬌態。這種美麗青春的保持時間的久暫，視內分泌機能的旺盛與否為斷。大概月經按期而至，經色鮮豔，這女性的青春保持，必然地較一般月經困難，神經衰弱等症的患者為次。這可說一句少似觀音的一語。　　但是一個月經不調，神經衰弱的女子，她年齡雖少，而因內分泌機能的減退。所以皮少脂肪減少，貧血，皺紋深刻，玉容憔悴，兩頰瘦削乳房平坦，現出一副可厭之老態。好象一尊猴精。由我從俄國勞働大學醫科畢業返國後之醫治經驗，以內服「補女容」最為適當。因為此劑有調整卵巢機能，通順月經，挽救青春腺，而旺盛機能，故發育亦歸健全。乳房高聳，肌肉細膩，面色紅潤，彥態動人。且愛受孕力甚強，故不孕者得孕。惟有白帶病者，亦可內服。惟須外用「卡而雪地氏」陰道片為坐藥。庶獲標本兼治之效。讀者園地　　下列各藥均經國內外醫科大學畢業醫師指定。購時請認明各藥名稱！切勿因他人言而購雜牌劣藥，以免誤服危險。　　傷風不愈　　胡精石問：前傷風，迄未治愈。現欬嗆很厲害。吐白色痰液，喉痒氣急；請示治療。尊答恙已成急性氣管炎，宜服『補肺拿爾』除痰欬！　　陰萎戒煙　　九江方淵雷君來函云：余　阿芙蓉癖，至今八九年，體日衰損，失眠心悸。乃迫於禁令，亟思戒除，然苦於早洩陽痿，且遺精頻來。嗣得申地友人魏君介紹，購服德國荷爾蒙製劑「補體康」；服後煙毒早除，各症均愈；邇來體重銳增云！　　洗滌淋病　　馮文如君問：鄙人誤患淋濁，妄投藥劑，致成慢性。目下睾丸腫硬，時發隱痛，尿內淋絲成多，莖中　癢灼熱。請問內服何藥，並外用何法醫治？答此淋毒睾丸炎，不愈即難生育。宜服「克淋儂」滅菌，並向永安公司及太和大藥房購「抗淋水」依法外洗自愈。　　歡迎問病！請函示尊址並附回郵，寄上海武定路八六九號。冬令進補之心得  留俄醫師楊道南　　一個衰　的人，或是　然的老年，或是病後的軀體，　天一過，他的衰態會更加厲害起來，而痛苦也愈甚！　　最顯著的症状，第一就是怕冷，舉動萎縮，四肢　　，其次如頭部覺空洞寒冷，太陽筋痛。以至週身無主，骨筋　痛等症。而一般體力較強的人，雖不致有這些感覺，可是手足發生凍　，也非常痛苦。　　據我在國外多年研究，認為最新發明的「補體康」確是冬令進補之妙品。因為它是荷爾蒙製劑，功能旺盛全身體力，故服後克免畏寒及凍　等，確有偉效。因遺精手淫及房勞而來之　早洩：已有特效法  Garler著　留日陳敏伯醫師譯　　夫妻的愛情，無論從生理或心理的方面說，完全是以性慾為主要因素；伉儷之間，若有了適當滿足的性生活，便能增加那蜜樣的恩情。　　假使患了性能萎弱症，不但妻子一方，得不到快慰：因而家庭破裂，了福掃地，那些要和丈夫離婚的女人，十個有九個是宣城丈夫有隱疾或精神病的；然而究其實在的情形，還不是爲了丈夫喪失掉天賦的男性機能，不能滿足她的慾求麼？　　這樣的丈夫，為着自己能力的薄弱。陰萎腎虧，一觸即洩，無論是怎樣的好漢，終必陷于懊悔與苦悶之中，為性而泣而嘆，甚而失眠，所以表面上頗有些神經病的樣子了。　　可是陰萎早洩，起源全由於少年時手淫，因而遺精夢洩，浪費了體內荷爾蒙及性機能。而由婚後房事過多也能致此。據最近醫學專家Widal及性病博士Kruse　M．D．氏之報告，他們完全證實『補體康』最能補給患者荷爾蒙，功善治療陰萎早洩！至手淫遺精可並服『耐而斯遺精片』，沒有不能治愈的。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言一件可喜的事  我　　自平津學界發起援綏運動後，各地響應，舉國從風，慷慨捐輸，傾囊相助，或節食，或節衣，或節煤炭，甚至監犯囚徒，亦願饑餓一日，以報效國家，供給於前敵將士，如火如荼，熱情熱血，此何現象？竟至於此，這就是表明全國人民的心理，這種心理，是愛國的心理，是同仇敵愾的心理，是永久發舒而未能發舒，今得一朝朝暴發的心理，這種心理的表現，我敢斷言，我國决不致於滅亡，决不致於無復興的希望，决不再會沉淪下去，豈不是一件可驚可喜的事麽？　　我國人有此心理，任何敵人，任何土匪漢奸，任何敵國外患，均不足懼，此種語調，似未免過於樂觀，似未免過於重視心理哲學，看國民的心理，竟有「萬應靈膏」之妙，其實不然，敵人之飛機大砲，雖在綏邊，多方壓迫，但是敵人的皮肉，敵人的骨血，子彈不能進，刀槍不能入，這是無法，倘然敵人的皮肉骨血，照樣能吃子彈，照樣能洞中，則任何利害的敵人，均無足畏，均無足懼，何也？衆志成城一語，假定非誣，則民氣的確有可用之處，民氣是國家的法賓，民氣是一國的錦囊。　　這種民氣，國家必須鄭重愛護，謹愼培養，不摧殘，不浪費，不挫折，更使發揚而廣大之，擴充之，則國家之救亡圖存者在此，復與民族者在此，永不爲强鄰的魚肉者亦在此，現在前方的戰報，多是節節勝利的戰報，多是可喜的戰報，，是綏邊之戰爭，方才開始，還沒有經過最大的激戰，一般土匪漢奸及在幕後策動者，正在調兵遺將，厲兵秣馬，以圖一逞，現在的小小勝利，决不足以自滿，亦决不足以誇人，更應當通盤籌劃，沉着應付。　　現在我們正應當與一般土匪漢奸流氓，淸算一筆舊賬的時候，也是剷除逆種，收復失地，保全主權的時候，我們應當來通盤計算一下，（一）决不可坐向待敵，專門作應接戰，遭遇戰，我們須當認淸敵入，我們須當認淸其實，凡是蒙滿兩處的土地，均爲我中華民國的土地，凡盤踞蒙滿兩地的人民，苟有反抗與叛背我國的命令與行爲者，均得痛痛快快，施行我們的戰略以消滅之，（二）關內之地，更爲我國心腹之地，决不容他人操縱，决不容他人破壞，决不容他人假借名義，有叛離中央的舉動，苟有一絲一毫主權受人牽制，土地爲人分割，這種痛心的事實，我們　當趁此時機，急起剷，再不可飲鴆止渴，再小可偸安一時，這是我人民援綏運動的希望。　　　　　　，我再有句　　，日　　　，　日口口聲聲，雨綏邊的，是中國內部的事，與彼國無干，現在日本大使館武官喜多，最近在滬對泰晤士訪員聲稱，日本對內蒙現局，確已參加，對於日本軍官，曾協助現時集中綏束之蒙偽匪軍事，該武官亦直認不諱，他們帮助匪偽侵略綏邊的計劃，業已公開，我們更應當盡我國力之所能，盡我民族財力民力之所及，必定與他們作最後之總結算。麪包  林娜　　那一家玻璃工塲就在我們底對過，好像一匹受驚的穿山甲似的，蜷縮在菜塲曠地底斜角，寂寞而且孤獨的。這一家工塲，規模並不見得怎樣大，外面那夾長的舖面，是作爲門市部用的，里面便是可以容納百多人底三間工塲。　　在門市部做事的，只有三個人：賬房洪先生，頭手夥計朱明和學徒陳四，除了是特別季節外，他們底工作是自由而且閑適的。照常一個洲府客進來，爲着幾毫錢的貨價不合，陳四那小夥子，會漲紅了面孔，一隻手不時在抓他頭上的癬瘡，用他不鈍正的在地話，呌喊着，說了許多刻薄話，比方如：　　「沒有帶錢來，問着玩」！或：　　「你有沒有帶眼睛來，這是什麽貨色」……　　洲府客，在洲府時他們會用使一百二十磅椰乾，變成一百磅的磅碼騙在地土人，可是一到這輝煌的城市，他們便變得愚笨而且膽小了，他們會紅着面，用聽不淸的嚅囁聲說着話，準備着退出店去。在這時賬房洪先生頭手朱明，便會乘機趕了出來，毫無理由地大聲把陳四斥駡一頓，又用非常客氣的態度把客人做硬做軟的拉轉來。於是乎，這筆買賣便成交了。　　當客人帶了他底貨色踏出門後，他們便擠在賬房里，大聲呌着，祝賀他們策略的成功。　　常常地，他們也用了同樣的策略，去對付私買淫者瑪拉。她是一個西班牙人底土生子，有一個高的鼻樑和兩隻灰的眼睛，年紀已經快三十了，挽着一個螺獅鬆，上身是一條綉花薄紗短杉，露着兩隻乳房，底下是一條印度綢圍成的裙，拖到地底下，腰間束着絲帶，赤足上拖了一雙木拖鞋。　　她常常到這玻璃工塲來，帶了她六歲大的女孩，當她用發顫的步伐，通過了暗探底注視，跨上店門時，便快活的呌道：支那，生意好」！　　他們似怕受了汚衊似的，會連看也不看她一眼，賬房架起他底眼鏡，從硯台上揑起筆來，胡亂地在廢紙頭上畫着，陳四則裝出一副輕視而又厭惡的面孔，頭手也溜走了：爲的只是一種策略，他們知道她來不會着別的。她乏趣地在店里跑來跑去，假裝着端詳每一種貨色的樣子。一會站到這面鏡前照照，一會去摸摸那塊玻璃。顧主們底冷淡並沒有使她吃驚，幾年來，她已習慣去看這些嘴面了，而且她很淸楚：他們這樣做，並非出於惡意，只是爲着表示他們對於這事的感不到興趣，可以在代價上佔點小便宜吧！　　在賬房口，她站住了，嘴里露着微笑。她知道賬房先生懂小了多少話，用不着抹灣轉角，便直截地呌道：「看看上帝底面上，賞點麵包給孩子吧」！　　賬房吃了了一驚似的抬起了頭，而且退下眼鏡，用他苦澀的嘴巴，低聲咕嚕着。他有一個習慣，不敢大聲和在地人講話，因了他底在地話說得太不行的原故，「什麽？」　　她移了步進去，用手按在他底肩上，附在他底耳旁悄悄的說道：　　「孩子餓了，賞片麵包吧……」說罷，又伸手去抬站在門外的孩子，把她拉到他面前。「你看她是多麽衰弱啊………」她深深的明白着，像她這樣的年紀已不足迷惑這一班半飢餓的支那入底心，她是相信上帝的，上帝吿訴過她，善人都有良心，一個良善的人，是不會讓孩子飢餓的。　　然而在洪先生他們，對於一個三十歲的中年婦人，和一個十六七的少女，是沒多大差別的，他們需要的是便宜，付出很少的代價，而能得到很大的滿足。幾年來，在他們這工塲里，差不多是風行着，用集體的方法去包一個或兩個女人，大家輪流着。這辦法，在他們幾個上層職員現在也時行着。看火燒者  韓龍臣作　　於是，他便照這辨法和她辦交涉，提出條件的是一塊半，由頭手和他自己兩人出。她嫌太少，拖了孩子想走。他便輕輕的去按了電鈴，頭手就滿大汗的從里面跑出來，像對付洲府客似的，把她呌轉來，低聲的磋商着，又加三毫錢。她斜眼去看一看孩子底黃色的面孔，輕輕的嘆一聲，便跟着他們到棧房里去了。　　直過了正中，我們才看見她帶了孩子出來，面孔蒼白，好像生了秘瘡似的一拐一拐朝我們這邊走，望櫃台上丟下五個「把那」的一個銀幣，低聲的說道：「麵包」！　　孩子爲了過度的狂喜，那雙小眼里就潤濕起來了。冬天  藩疆　　送一個朋友上船，和他握手吿別，看着輸船緩緩地向黑暗中駛去了，才拱起手來對嘴吹者氣，佇立了半天的兩條腿也有些行動不能自如了。　　已經是夜半，碼頭上沒有一輛街車，幾盞昏黃的街燈照着我們送行的幾個；影子倒在路上彷彿是幾尾僵死了的　蛇。大家敞起了大衣的領，互相投了個眼色，就並行着放開步子走路。</p>

<p>路是　的修長，大家沉默着，或許是迎面的寒風使我們張不開口，或許在懷念離別的朋友，他將要在北方過一個風雪的冬天。　　大都市彷彿已經停止了呼吸，祗有我們幾個堅强的脚步聲。　　在拐進一條小路的時候，我們才被一盞光亮的電炬逗引了我們的目光，那是一家北方的宵夜館。門前是兩個大火爐，一鍋剛燒好的什麽點心由一個大胖子捧着進店堂去，一股濃郁的香味直刺着我們的嗅官，同時遍體都覺得和暖起來。　　「吃一點宵夜？」　　誰忍不住開口了。又像這句話已背得那樣純熟，只等着一個適合的機會去投中每個人的心窩。於是抖抖衣領，來不及等一個回答的聲音大家跑向舖子了　　店堂裏有三五張桌子，靠壁的一張上坐着一對夫婦倆，各自棒着一只粗大的碗，把一鍋大麵分着吃。那個胖子見了我們，馬上攤開手讓我們到裏屋去。那裏有一張竹蘭掛着，上面是一內有雅座」四個白漆大字。我本來沒有雅不雅的預算，在冷風裏跑了許多路，又肚子餓，現在就是那鍋子大麵，也是什麽珍貴的東西都及不來的美味了。但是那個北方典型的堂倌所攤着的那張粗大的手掌彷彿一支察棍，面上又掛着一團和氣似的笑臉，於在一聲聽不淸楚的吆喝之下，由裏屋的一個小伙計打開竹簾押送我們進了雅座。　　所謂雅座和散座簡直沒有一點分別。到算賬時候才知道雅座賈大洋，散座賣小洋的。一位朋友稱之曰「吃雅座，這似乎很幽默的。　　剛坐定，大胖子打着面巾進來了。一邊沒命抹着桌子，問我們吃酒還是吃點心。我們要了幾色南方人常吃的北方點心，要他快做，他才一疊連聲的喊了出去。　　喝了一盅熱茶，彷彿洗了一個溫水浴，手掌，手背，面頰都泛着紅潤的光彩，一股暖氣直透到脚底心。做了大半天啞吧，這時候又談起要在北方過一個風雪的冬天底朋友。　　「北方是個好地方！」一個說：「北方人都是謙和的，樸實的，你看那個堂倌。」　　「是的！另一個回答：」他太爽直了，都市裏實在是沒有像他那樣的傻子的，北方人才是那個樣子的，我希望他在第一封信來的時候就吿訴我們他是怎樣高興着北方呢！」　　胖堂倌端點心進來了。每人面前放了一個碟子，問我們要醋要醬油，一一爲我們倒了。他站在半邊看着我們吃點心，聽我們在講着朋友到北方後的情形時候，他揷嘴了：　　「你老送朋友上天津去？」　　我們點點頭。　　「那邊冷啊！」他會表情，裝做顫抖的樣子，「這時候恐怕要下雪了——雪眞大啊！」　　他彷彿懷念家鄕的風雪似的。聽他那口南腔北調，大槪他離別故鄉已經許多時候了。　　「但是北方人爽直，朋友回答他，我喜歡北方人。　　「你老好說話。」他高興地笑着。　　吃過點心，他又忙着送面巾，牙籤，漱口水，這種股勤招待的態度，在南方的任何那一種館子中所找不出的。我們一共吃了一塊幾毛錢，給他二塊錢就不要找了，於是一聲出乎意外的呌喊從雅座直喊到竹簾外面去，喊着一賞幾毛幾分，」在外面的伙計馬上又高聲和應着。我們就在這喊聲中送出來。　　外面的風更大了，有一個小乞兒檔住在門口對着火爐取暖，他似乎要睡過去似的，沒有見到我們出來，胖堂迷惘刦巳在背後看淸楚了，他立刻趕到我們前面對小乞兒兜胸踢了一腿，那個孩子祗一滾就跌到馬路中心。　　「這兎崽子眞可惡！」他勝利地笑着對我們說。　　我對他有了一眼，又想起在旅途中的朋友，他將要在北方過一個風雪的冬天。播音話劇　　電送劇社　　佛音（九八〇）下午九時至十時　　拉娜　　娜拉又不敢把這種情形對他丈夫直說，她只有好像無理由的要求滔佛不要開除柯樂克在銀行裏的職位。滔佛是個以自己的意志爲意志的人，他决計將柯樂克的位置讓給林敦夫人去做。　　柯樂克得不到娜拉的幫助，他便寫好了一封信，警吿郝爾茂滔佛他要立刻宣佈假冒簽名的秘密；這封信，他是擲在門口那個滔佛的信箱裏的。而信箱的鑰匙又在滔佛自己的手裏，娜拉是無法拿它開開的。　　滔佛終於看了柯樂克吿發娜拉的秘密的信，他覺得娜拉這種行動會斷送了他終身幸福，斷送了他的前程。他怒責着娜拉像犯了不可赦的罪人一樣。特別節目　　蝠影樂會　　交通（一三〇〇）下午四時半至五時一刻（一）行街四合（二）運環扣（三）凱旋（四）孔雀（五）屛粉紅運（浦夢古，李志翱，邢寶蓮）　　怒吼團　　交通（一三〇〇）下午五時三刻至六時半（一）打回老家去（二）頭頂中國天（三）扮禾歌（四）碼頭工人（五）代表糟糕（六）活路歌（七）示威歌（八）中華民族不會亡　　志鵠社國樂　　李樹德（九四〇）下午七時一刻至八時（一）走馬（二）霓裳曲（三）中花六（四）琵琶獨奏（五）琵琶詞彈詞　　曹笑英「玉蜻蜓」　　中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻　　開篇「花名」　　金爐且把國香焚。素馨一片禱神明。奴本是。芍藥嬌軀閨閣秀。紫荊停阻少精神。多時不想山茶飲。無奈聊將罄粟呑。剪春羅帳長思睡。荼糜香夢帶昏沉。梳妝嬾把芙蓉粉。金雀無心揀鬢雲。錦葵披體猶嫌冷。柳腰常盤石榴裙。到晚來。滿腹雪蕉眠未穩。杜鵑枝上月三更。竟做了。姣嫩海棠無力倦。要拜求。那坐蓮花觀世音。保奴家。病恙脫除添百台。四時月季退災星。欵冬度過交新歲。吿禀萱花慈母離。花是金銀心願了。佛見笑神前達志誠。不學那。桃花輕薄隨流水。要修行學道樂長春。十姊妹雖已完花燭。我是素蘭不願染紅塵。要曉得。開盡牡丹誇富貴。幾番蝴蝶夢非眞。說甚麽紫薇郞貌多溫雅。說甚麽荷花凡緻妙娉婷。憑你玉蘭金鳳客。都是　花會襄人。珠籘帝掛也虛名。　　何芸芳何翠芳「雙珠球」　　元昌（一一二〇）下午三時半至四時一刻　　開篇「花月痕」　　絕代奇書花月痕。情塲因果活紛紛。秋心院裏人如玉。春鏡樓頭客斷魂。夢到雙鴛心事件。十年飄泊困風麜。才人落魄尋常事。辜負了昂藏七尺身。莫笑痴珠窮困絕。憐才奇女有秋痕。相逢何必曾相識。都是天涯落淪人。收拾綺　歸恨地。聊將一死報殊恩。采秋同是倡家女。詩賦文章白事能。轉態風流人　絕。一雙巨眼識書生。從來艷福火生就。箭雙雕好事成。富貴貧窮何足道。顯榮困頓英輕論。唐衢涕淚馮唐老。浩氣　然志不仲。麻得千秋佳話在。及身而後布衣尊閑來說盡吾心頭恨。不管天　與地昏。拘琵琶花月淡留痕。　　蔣賓初「三笑」　　新聲（一三八〇）下午七時至八時</p>

<h3>National Army Captured Bailing Temple Yesterday Morning; Enemy Casualties Numbered Nearly One Thousand, Our Troops Victoriously Advancing; Central Government Troops Arriving in Sui Territory One After Another to Assist in Suppression; A Certain Faction's Plan to Invade Northern Sui Thwarted</h3>
<p>(Guihua) Our army began attacking Bailing Temple last night, and by 9:00 AM on the 24th, after seven consecutive assaults, finally occupied the temple. Fu Zuoyi did not sleep all night. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) It is reported that Fu Zuoyi and Zhao Chengzhou jointly telegraphed the cabinet, stating that Bailing Temple was captured by our Zhao Chengzhou's cavalry this afternoon, and is now completely occupied. They are still pursuing and suppressing the enemy in victory. Yan, upon receiving the telegram, immediately sent a reply of commendation and telegraphed 5,000 yuan as a reward. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Northern Sui was still peaceful on the 23rd, but the situation was extremely urgent. Mongolian troops from Bailing Temple moved south, bringing the front outposts of both sides closer. Taolin was quiet on the 23rd. Enemy planes were still scouting the border villages of Xinghe. Xinghe was peaceful. The bandits dispersed into smaller groups and wreaked havoc on the border of Xinghe for days. Our reserve militiamen were often able to achieve surprising victories, capturing many bandits. On the 23rd, Meng Wenzhong telegraphed the provincial government, praising the reserve militiamen. Grain prices in Sui rose sharply, with each yuan buying only ten catties of white flour and nine catties of oiled noodles, posing a very serious food problem for the people. Prince Yun and Beizi Shabai sent representatives to Sui to meet with Fu Zuoyi and beg for assistance on the 23rd. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Gui Sui The bandit army advancing towards our Wuchuan and Guyang from the Bailing Temple area was met with head-on attacks by various infantry and cavalry units of the national army, including those led by Zeng Yan'yi, Sun Changsheng, and Sun Lanfeng, on the night of the 23rd. They repelled the bandits at 10 PM that night. Bandits near Bailing Temple engaged in fierce battles with the national army all night, engaging in hand-to-hand combat more than ten times. The national army bombarded them with artillery fire. Commander Liu of the national army charged into the temple, and various units followed, pressing forward. At dawn on the 24th, the bandits, unable to withstand the assault, fled in disarray to the northeast. The national army completely occupied Bailing Temple at 8:00 AM on the 24th. Bandit corpses littered the field, numbering over 300, with over 600 wounded and over 300 captured. The national army also seized over 400 bandit rifles and countless other radio equipment, automobiles, ammunition, and supplies. When the bandits left the temple, they set fire to nearby houses. The fleeing bandits are currently being pursued. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Gui Sui After a certain faction's mastermind, Wang Ying's bandit troops, failed to attack eastern Sui, they turned their attention to northern Sui. On the 23rd, the bandits first used 100 trucks to transport over 2,000 puppet soldiers to the temple, and planned to transport another 5,000 puppet soldiers to the temple with 200 trucks on the 24th. Therefore, if the national army could not capture Bailing Temple by the morning of the 24th, it would be more difficult by the afternoon. A report has just been received from the front lines that the national army has already reached the temple on the morning of the 24th. The news has greatly boosted morale. Tang Enbo and the cavalry unit of Men Bingyue have already arrived in the Sui region. Tang and Men came to Sui a few days ago to meet with Fu Zuoyi for instructions and have since returned to their respective defense posts to make arrangements. It is heard that more central government troops are entering Sui and will reach their designated defense areas within days. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Guihua) There were no changes in eastern Sui on the 24th. Several enemy planes came to the border of our Xinghe to drop bombs and scout. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) At 7:00 AM on the 24th, five planes flew from Shangdu to northern Sui for reconnaissance. Recently, the bandits and puppets have been actively reinforcing northern Sui and transporting equipment. Over the past three or four days, no fewer than 1,000 troops from Rehe bandits have passed through Kangbao and transferred to Shangdu via Duolun every day. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) On the 24th, Jiang Kanghu arrived in Zhang from Peiping. At 4:00 PM, he gave a lecture at the provincial government on "Our Way Out," attended by hundreds of people from military and political circles. Jiang responded to a telegram invitation and will take the night train to Sui on the 20th. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to sources, the bandit army in eastern Sui has repeatedly attacked but ultimately failed, suffering heavy losses. They have changed their plan and shifted their target to northern Sui. In recent days, there has been fierce fighting in the Wuchuan and Guyang areas. The central government has dispatched a large army to assist Suiyuan in suppressing the bandits. It is heard that the Sui army reached Bailing Temple at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 24th. The whereabouts of De Wang are unknown. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Jining reports that the war in northeastern and western Sui is intensifying. The bandit army is using small units to operate between our positions, keeping our defenses on edge. The current battle line extends from Honggetu and Nanhaogian in the east to Taolin, Wuchuan, and Guyang in the north, and to Baotou in the west, forming a semi-circular shape stretching 280 li. The bandit army is using reconnaissance planes to gain a thorough understanding of our military deployments. At the same time, they are using small units of cavalry to divert our attention while secretly transporting large units to attack our weak points. We have recently devised meticulous plans to strictly prevent this. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Jining reports that over 1,000 newly arrived puppet Rehe troops, 30 armored vehicles, and four planes have arrived at Bailing Temple. A certain faction's air force base has been completed. Four planes arrived on the 22nd and began scouting our northern Sui positions on the 23rd. It is also heard that a large quantity of poison gas has been transported from Zhangbei. Our rear defense units are rushing to prepare gas masks. Our army's position at Honggetu has been moved forward. The area is still peaceful. Residents who had taken refuge elsewhere have returned. (Special Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Gui Sui reports that on the 23rd, the bandit puppet army suddenly launched attacks from Bailing Temple in two directions, heading towards Wuchuan and Guyang in northern Sui, attempting to occupy Daqingshan. Our army immediately engaged them. The two sides made contact and fought throughout the night. The bandits were unable to withstand the assault on the morning of the 24th and retreated north. Our army is still holding its original defenses, maintaining a strict guard. A certain faction's planes have been flying over our positions for days, conducting reconnaissance and putting on a show of force over Pingdiquan. The arrival of a large portion of the central government's aid to the Sui army has boosted morale on the front lines. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A visitor from Zhangyuan reports that the fighting in the Wuchuan and Guyang area of northern Sui was fierce last night and this morning. Puppet planes flew to Xinghe this morning to conduct reconnaissance and drop bombs along the border. Today, a large camel caravan carrying kerosene, supplies, and other goods left Bailing Temple for Wuchuan for use. (Special Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A visitor from eastern Sui reports that Wang Ying and others initially gathered bandits and repeatedly culled them. Although the number of remaining bandits is small, they are all fierce and skilled in battle. Their ranks also include many intellectuals who provide strategic planning. The Mongolian bandits originally used the years of Genghis Khan's reign. Recently, Wang's bandits changed to the Yellow Emperor's era and claimed the title of "Great Han Righteous Army." Their retreat to a position over 30 li from Honggetu is a ploy to lure the enemy in, planning to position their flanks to encircle our army. They have also obtained over ten planes from a certain faction to reinforce the front lines and will invade eastern Sui within days. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Damilingsulong telegraphed from Kuaiyou to Beijing on the 24th, reporting the puppet bandits' attack on Honggetu. The most noteworthy information is that a certain faction ordered Wang Ying's bandit troops to be in the front of this attack, with Li Shouxin's bandit troops monitoring from behind. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to news from Guihua Huafang today, the Sui army has encircled and attacked and has retaken Bailing Temple in northern Sui. Details are not yet known. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>() It is heard in Beiping that this afternoon, "Manchukuo" and Mongolian troops are rapidly advancing towards Wuchuan and Guyang. There is a risk of war breaking out in those two places at any time. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a telegram from Guihua, "Manchukuo" and Mongolian troops in northern Sui have begun to advance southward from Bailing Temple. They number approximately several thousand, divided into two columns moving towards Wuchuan and Guyang, several miles north of Guihua. Chairman Fu Zuoyi of Sui has ordered the garrisons in those two places to resist. Since the crisis in Sui Province, the front lines in northern Sui have remained quiet, with all battles confined to the eastern Sui area. However, the phenomenon is now expanding. The "Manchukuo" and Mongolian troops' invasion from the north is clearly intended to restrain the flanks of the Sui provincial garrison, as that army has repeatedly inflicted heavy blows on enemy forces that directly invaded eastern Sui from Chahar Province. At the same time, the "Manchukuo" and Mongolian army side has reinforcements arriving in Duolun and Guyuan from Rehe. It is said that roughly one thousand troops have entered Chahar from Rehe in the past two days, but it is not yet known which country they belong to. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Holds Emergency Meeting</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Upon hearing the news of our victory at Bailing Temple, the North China Garrison held an emergency meeting at Zhangyuan Residence at 10:00 PM on the 24th. It was attended by Itagaki, Mutō, Takeshita, and other Kwantung Army officers. They had not adjourned when the telegram was sent. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>A Certain Faction Sends Someone to Monitor De Wang</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Jining reports that De Wang's regret is growing stronger. Fearing that he will escape, a certain faction sent the special affairs agency chief Tanaka to Xisuni to monitor him, never leaving his side. He has lost his freedom. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Recently, bandit puppets suddenly attacked Suiyuan. Apart from various places between Shangdu and Xinghe, the bandit puppets are using Bailing Temple as a base to attempt to invade within the Daqingshan mountains. It is heard that the central government sent a telegram to De Wang stating that Bailing Temple is located in the Sui-Mongolian region. Personnel from the former Mongolian Local Autonomy Political Affairs Committee should comply with previous orders and move out of Bailing Temple to avoid inflicting disaster on the Mongolian people. The telegram also criticized De Wang for lightly provoking conflict, meeting with troops, and undermining his years of loyalty, inwardness, and maintenance of the overall situation, which he can no longer explain, causing the central government deep sorrow.

<h3>Tianjin Japanese Military Headquarters Meeting, Important Discussion on Sui Affairs; Hashimoto and Wachi Report on Hebei, Chahar, and Shandong Situations; Kwantung and North China Army Headquarters Decide on Concrete Plans</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At the important meeting held at the Tianjin Haiguangsi Headquarters on the 24th, Hashimoto and Wachi first reported on the recent situations in Hebei, Chahar, and Shandong, respectively. Mutō then reported on the situation in eastern Sui. Subsequently, the discussion was divided into three sections: 1. Methods and measures for monitoring the northward movement of troops; 2. Direct and decisive measures regarding the eastern Sui affair; 3. International propaganda and correcting its views. Tadashi, Itagaki, and others each expressed important opinions. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Many observers here believe that Itagaki's arrival in Tianjin today and Mutō's trip to Zhangbei suggest that there will be rapid developments in Chahar and Sui provinces as a result. The "Manchukuo" and Mongolian armies' attempt to invade Sui will likely disappoint those who initiated it. If the claim that the Sui army has retaken Bailing Temple is true, it will undoubtedly be a major blow to those elements. Therefore, the situation in the province is already likely to undergo very significant changes. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Lieutenant General Itagaki, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, arrived here by plane today and met with the leaders of the Japanese garrison. He plans to go to Tongzhou tomorrow and then head to Zhangbei. It is reported that Kwantung Army Staff Officer Mutō and the officers of this garrison held an important meeting and then hurriedly took a plane to Zhangbei first. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Itagaki is scheduled to travel with Mutō, Takeshita, Ono and others, as well as staff members from the North China Garrison Headquarters, from Peiping to Zhangbei on the 26th to meet with Li Shouxin, and then to Shangdu Bailing Temple to meet with Wang Ying, De Wang and others to give important instructions. At the high-ranking officers' meeting of the Tianjin military headquarters on the 24th, a further clear expression will be given regarding the eastern Sui issue. If necessary, the Kwantung Army will be deployed to directly participate in the war under some pretext. Therefore, the recent disturbances in Wuchuan, Xinghe, and Taolin are still not a formal major war. Once the troops from outside the customs are completely assembled in ten days, a large encirclement and harassment will begin. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Itagaki, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Mutō, Chief of the Second Section, Takeshita, Chief of the Third Section, and Major Ono, arrived in Tianjin from Changchun by plane on the 24th. They arrived at the Haiguangsi Headquarters at 1:00 PM to meet with Tadashi and immediately convened an important military meeting. Hashimoto, Iida, Kayashima, Wachi, Sentada, Asai, Tsukada, Kawada, Matsumuro, Imai, Hamada, and others participated. Regarding the eastern Sui incident and the current situation in North China, they discussed until 4:00 PM before dispersing. The two military headquarters have decided on a concrete new plan, which will be forwarded to all relevant parties for implementation when Itagaki returns to Changchun on the 28th. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The views of the Japanese military headquarters inside and outside the customs differ slightly on the eastern Sui affair. The Kwantung Army advocates a hardline approach, and naval officers in North China support this idea, also hoping to take the opportunity to build their achievements. The North China Army Headquarters, on the other hand, believes that it will affect economic development and should be kept within appropriate limits. There was a detailed discussion at the Tianjin meeting on the 24th. Due to the relationship of authority, those who advocate a hardline approach prevailed. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Chen Juesheng returned to Tianjin from Peiping at 7:00 PM on the 24th, on behalf of Song, to pay his respects to Itagaki. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Nakajima, a Japanese major and military advisor to the Hebei Chahar Council, came to Tianjin from Peiping on the 24th to meet with Itagaki and make a report. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 8:00 PM on the 24th, Tadashi hosted a banquet for Itagaki, Mutō, Takeshita, and others at Zhangyuan Residence. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) From 8:00 AM on the 24th, Tadashi and his staff, Hashimoto and others, began inspecting the troops at the Haiguangsi barracks. The inspection concluded at noon. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3>Sir Otto Niemeyer's Speech Praises China's Revival; Hopes to Establish Constitutional Government to Ensure Stability; China's Prosperity Can Resolve Japan's Economic Difficulties</h3>
<p>(London) Sir Otto Niemeyer, the British government's chief economic advisor, delivered a speech at a luncheon hosted by the Imperial Association today, focusing on the current state of China and expressing admiration for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. He said, "Chiang's handling of the political situation has proven him to be a first-class statesman. I believe that Chinese public opinion strongly supports the current government. Despite the immense difficulties that it faces, it has been able to revive China without external assistance after years of internal warfare. Its achievements are truly great. We can hope that the government led by Chiang will continue to exist for a long time, so that it can consolidate the administrative organs and further establish a constitutional system to maintain the future stability of the country."</p>
<p>Sir Niemeyer continued, "When I left China seven days ago, there were all sorts of gloomy predictions circulating among the population, but in fact everything went smoothly. Foreign exchange has been maintained at a stable level without difficulty. The communists in Shanxi Province have fled into the mountains. Losses caused by smuggling have been significantly limited. The Southwest crisis has also been completely resolved. The authority of the National Government has spread throughout the country. Those who have traveled through the troubled areas of Europe can no longer claim that China is more disordered than Europe. Knowing that China has such a large population, it is actually quite peaceful in its current state. Most of China can now be traded with safely, without hindrance." Sir Niemeyer also mentioned the rapid reforms and developments of the Chinese government over the past five years, such as the construction of highways and railways, and the improvement of the legal system, which are all worthy of the world's attention. Therefore, the current danger is not that China is progressing too slowly, but rather that it is attempting to progress too quickly.</p>
<p>Sir Niemeyer praised the success of China's currency reform, saying that China may now hold the position of creditor in international accounts. China's currency reform still needs to accomplish one thing to be considered complete, which is the reorganization of the Central Bank. Sir Niemeyer also said that he believes that the Chinese government's work is on the right track, and the basic conditions for developing trade are now emerging. China's repayment of railway loans is a positive strategy, as it can enable others to continue lending to China. This is the proper way to develop railway construction.</p>
<p>Sir Niemeyer expressed his pleasure at the appointment of Caulcott to be the British Export Credit Guarantee Bureau's representative in China, and solemnly stated that the British export guarantee is not a subsidy, but is strictly limited to commercial aspects and is a guarantee against credit risk. Sir Niemeyer believes that China's main crisis lies in external political disputes, and quoted British Foreign Secretary Eden's statement in the House of Commons on November 5 that the tension between China and Japan has shown clear signs of easing, and that the previous tension will hopefully not be seen again.</p>
<p>The Knight continued to describe his two visits to Japan, saying, "We should express deep sympathy for Japan's difficulties, which are very similar to those we have encountered, namely, maintaining a large population. There is a growing trend among Japan's major industrialists to acknowledge that their country's difficulties are partly due to overproduction and partly due to competition among the Japanese themselves. Therefore, the movement to control production and export trade is gaining momentum. When the Japanese recognize that we cannot allow foreigners to overthrow British industry, we will not be willing to exacerbate the economic difficulties of the Japanese. We now earnestly hope to find a form of Anglo-Japanese cooperation."</p>
<p>Sir Niemeyer concluded, "I am definitely optimistic about China. I feel that China's prosperity and stable development will help Japan resolve its economic difficulties more than anything else. I believe that this point is gradually being realized in Japan, and there will come a day when we can work with the Chinese government to advance China's revival." (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Attaché Amemiya Talks About Japanese Ronin Participating in Bandit Puppet Armies; Leaves It Up to Chinese Army to Dispose of Them Freely; China Can Freely Suppress Japanese Merchants Smuggling Weapons into China</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign news agencies report that Japanese Army Attaché Kita Seiichi has already directly admitted that Japanese officers are assisting bandit puppets in invading Sui. This action greatly contradicts previous statements by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the embassy. Journalists specifically inquired about this matter with Japanese Army Attaché Amemiya Tatsumi stationed in Beijing yesterday afternoon to learn the truth. Amemiya replied that, according to his imagination, Military Attaché Kita would not make such a blunt statement. Amemiya then solemnly stated two points: (1) He cannot guarantee that there are no Japanese commanding officers among the bandit puppet armies. He believes that if there are any, they would only be Japanese ronin, whom the Chinese formal army can freely dispose of. (2) Even if the majority of the sharp weapons used by the Mongolian bandit puppets come from the Japanese side, they must have been smuggled in by some greedy merchants. The Chinese side can, of course, suppress them at will. The reporter further asked what the Japanese military would think if the war were to spread to Chahar. Amemiya replied that he himself is not clear about that at the moment, but Chahar is Chinese territory, and the Chinese side can, of course, suppress bandits at will.

<h3>Fu Zuoyi's Speech Summary</h3>
<p>(Guihua) On the evening of the 23rd, Fu Zuoyi spoke at a banquet for Duan Maolan, Cheng Cangbo, and other representatives of students who came to Sui to comfort the troops. (1) During this period of serious national crisis, a great change has recently occurred in the minds of the Chinese people, which is the deep understanding that China is a weak country and should not engage in rash actions. However, for the sake of survival, it must be ensured that there is at least no division, no loss of territory, and no loss of sovereignty in order to build a new country. In recent years, Suiyuan has had many interactions with foreigners, especially the Japanese. We have obeyed the central government's order of neighborly relations and have treated them with courtesy and protection for the past year, maintaining our friendship with a sincere attitude and exhausting our efforts to mediate. However, the Sui-East incident still unfortunately occurred, which is extremely disheartening. Rumors have been rampant recently, and there is widespread suspicion of complex international backgrounds. A responsible member of a friendly country has solemnly stated that the Sui-East affair has no international connection but is an internal Chinese problem. However, it is inevitable that there are non-Chinese people involved. We believe that while it is certainly hateful for bad Chinese to act as traitors, it is even more regrettable if citizens of civilized powers violate the strategies of their own countries and participate in it, not hesitating to destroy peace in East Asia. National officials have their respective responsibilities, and defending the territory and protecting the people is the bounden duty of border soldiers. Under this dangerous situation, from the perspective of our country, it is to eliminate the bad elements, and from the perspective of East Asia, it is to remove the obstacles to peace. But even though the war has begun, the principle of neighborly relations will not change. I will definitely not act out of recklessness or fame. Fu Zuoyi has always advocated not causing trouble, but is not afraid of trouble. Throughout my life, I have never spoken harsh words or done weak deeds, so as not to fail in my duties. (2) Recently, the compassion and assistance of the people of the country towards Zuoyi is extremely moving and shameful. However, the defense plan for eastern Sui is all carried out in accordance with the orders of senior officers, while those who face the artillery fire and expose themselves to the blades are the soldiers on the front lines who are far more hardworking than Zuoyi. Ever since the country has been in trouble, comrades everywhere have often communicated their feelings and care, and their love for the country, enthusiasm, and loyalty to the country are all ten times greater than Zuoyi. It is the duty of a soldier to suppress bandits in the bandit area. Now, this empty reputation only increases my shame. (3) This national comfort for Suiyuan is extraordinarily enthusiastic. In particular, the students do not eat or light fires, and some are willing to sacrifice themselves on the front lines, which is even more moving and admirable. Everyone should know that defenses against soldiers are being prepared with all our might. The revival of the country is a long-term struggle that cannot be achieved in five or ten years. The youth are the continuation of the nation's life, with great responsibilities. We do not want them to make light of sacrifice, nor do we want them to suffer hunger and cold. I hope that all the students will provide more mental and intellectual assistance in the future, working together to repay the country. (4) It is planned to immediately establish a joint military-civilian committee to handle the comfort funds and materials donated by all parties, with members from various armies and gentry openly managing them. All the funds received will be set aside, except for the wounded soldiers' comforts, and will be at the disposal of senior officers. In the future, they will be used properly, either as rewards or to replenish weapons, so as not to fail the enthusiasm of our compatriots' donations. I hope you will convey this intention to the schools upon your return. (5) Finally, Zuoyi believes that our country will certainly be revived and our nation will certainly be able to save itself. The reason for this revival and salvation is not that the soldiers can shed blood and dare to fight, but that the Chinese people's hearts are not dead. In other words, although our land can be invaded and our people can be slaughtered, this patriotic psychology cannot be changed by anyone. This sincerity alone is enough to overcome all circumstances. I hope everyone will work together towards that end. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Donations to Console Frontline Soldiers</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) Yu Hanmou's telegram of the 24th to Yan Xishan, Fu Zuoyi, and the frontline soldiers, briefly stated: "You, sir, oversee your troops, defending the borders. The army marches in snowy lands, bravely leading the way. I respectfully lead my officers and soldiers, saving on food to gather funds, offering our sincere contribution to express our humble feelings. Now, we remit five hundred thousand yuan in national currency through the Bank of China. We first beg for your acceptance, etc." (Central News Agency telegram, 24th)</p>

(Special telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Six major criminals involved in the assassination case of (刺注案) Zhang Yutang and others, whose cases have not yet concluded, are still detained at the Capital District Court.

(Central News Agency telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Hankou Boy Scouts held a fundraising campaign to console the Suiyuan soldiers. The results were excellent. After verification, the total amount of donations was four thousand one hundred eighty-eight yuan, one dime, and eight li. The association decided to directly send (the funds) to the Boy Scout General Association on the 25th to be forwarded to Suiyuan. (Central News Agency telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Chengdu) All faculty and students of the Rong Branch of the Central Military Academy donated one day's income to console the frontline soldiers. Yan Xishan replied with a telegram of thanks on the 23rd, briefly stating: "Your telegram has been received. We acknowledge with gratitude your donation of one day's income to console the soldiers suppressing the bandits in eastern Suiyuan. We are extremely grateful. We have announced this to our comrades on the front lines, all of whom are inspired to fight bravely and swear to defend the territory to repay the nation, in response to the enthusiasm of your consolation. We send this reply to express our thanks." (Central News Agency telegram, 24th)</p>

Yan hosted a banquet at the Suiyuan headquarters in the evening. According to Wang, all circles in Shanghai deeply admire the loyalty and bravery of the Shanxi-Suiyuan soldiers in suppressing the bandits. This time, they have brought one hundred thousand yuan to offer comfort in person and inspect the situation at the front lines. Shanghai is still fundraising. The date of departure to Suiyuan can be discussed and decided after Yan's banquet tonight. (Special telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3>Fu Zuoyi Replies to Ma Chaojun by Telegram</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Suiyuan Chairman Fu Zuoyi replied to Mayor Ma Chaojun of Nanjing on the morning of the 23rd, briefly stating: "Your telegram has been respectfully received. I am deeply grateful for your comfort and encouragement in the Suiyuan-Eastern campaign. The three armies, upon hearing the order, are even more inspired. We will certainly exert our best efforts to fulfill our duties and live up to your expectations." (Central News Agency telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yan Xishan replied to the Nanjing New Life Movement Association by telegram, stating: "The bandit-puppet forces are invading Suiyuan, and we are responsible for defending the territory. We are deeply grateful for your praise and encouragement. The military situation on the front lines is favorable, and morale is extremely high. We are determined to resist the enemy and fulfill our duty to defend the country." (Special telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3>Shimizu Visits Gao Zongwu, Still Conducting Sideline Contacts, A Glimpse of the Japanese Newspaper's Tone</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Shimizu, Secretary of the Japanese Embassy, visited Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at around 10:00 AM on the 24th for sideline contacts regarding the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations. However, Shimizu did not express a clear position on the Suiyuan issue. He left at around 11:00 AM. According to Gao, Shimizu's visit was still a general conversation, not involving specific issues or reaching any conclusions. The date of the eighth meeting between (川張) Chuan and Zhang has not yet been determined. (Special telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers here today commented on the Sino-Japanese negotiations in an extremely pessimistic tone. The Jiji Shinpo stated that the Sino-Japanese talks have finally reached a critical juncture of life and death. Should they seek a outline solution to relatively small issues and postpone discussion of anti-communism and the North China problem, or immediately halt the current negotiations altogether? The newspaper also stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement on the 22nd regarding the Suiyuan situation contained the basic assertion that, should the negotiations fail, China would be condemned for lacking sincerity, and that the Mongolian army would actively continue its actions regardless of Japan's attitude. Therefore, the newspaper believes that the Suiyuan war will inevitably expand. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that under these circumstances, the hope of obtaining satisfactory results from the Nanjing negotiations is dwindling. The above two newspapers' comments are quite representative of public opinion. (Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Executive Yuan Approves Temporary Measures for Food Regulation, Issues Jing-Gan Railway Construction Bonds, Appoints Feng Zhi'an as Chairman of Hebei Provincial Government</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan held its 289th regular meeting on the morning of the 24th. Zhang Qun, Chen Shuren, Chen Shaokuan, Wu Zhongxin, Wu Dingchang, Liu Ruiheng, and Zhang Jiaxuan attended. Zhang Qun chaired the meeting.</p>
<p>Items Discussed (1) Reports from the Ministers of Interior, Military Affairs, Finance, Industry, Railways. Submitted for review: The case of various provinces and cities requesting a ban on food exports. It was generally agreed that food should be freely circulated within the country to achieve a balance between supply and demand. The measures proposed by various provinces and cities to restrict food exports are not in line with economic principles and the central government's aim of coordinating food management, and it seems inappropriate to approve them. Also, Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry proposed temporary measures for food regulation and requested its publication. It was resolved to approve the proposal according to the review opinion and to revise the temporary measures for food regulation and circulate them for compliance. (2) Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance and Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Railways requested the temporary issuance of 140 million yuan of Jing-Gan Railway construction bonds and submitted bond regulations and a principal and interest repayment schedule for a decision. It was resolved to pass the motion and send it to the Central Political Council for review by the Legislative Yuan. (3) The Ministry of Health submitted a letter stating that the Shanghai Puci Sanatorium is a hospital for treating mental illness, which can meet social needs and assist academic research. It is still a pioneering effort in the country. It is proposed to request a subsidy from the central government. It was resolved to grant an appropriate subsidy, and the amount will be reviewed by the Ministry of Finance. (4) The National Government submitted a proposal to discuss the general supplementary revenue and expenditure budget for Nanjing City in the 24th year. It was resolved to approve it and consult the Legislative Yuan. (5) Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry requested that a new clause be added after Article 24 of the Fisheries Law, stipulating that inland river fish ponds may be fenced off as Article 25, and that the phrase "compensation for damages" be added to the original Article 41. The revised articles were submitted for review by the Legislative Yuan. It was resolved to approve them and consult the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>Appointments and Removals (1) It was resolved to approve the resignation of Song Zheyuan from his positions as member and chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government. Feng Zhi'an was appointed as member and chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government.

(3) The President proposed that Liu Guanglie, Administrative Commissioner of the 11th District of Sichuan Province, and Xian Ying, Administrative Commissioner of the 13th District of Sichuan Province, should be relieved of their positions as they have other appointments. Xian Ying was appointed as Administrative Commissioner of the 11th District of Sichuan Province, and Liu Guanglie was appointed as Administrative Commissioner of the 13th District of Sichuan Province. The proposal was approved. (4) The President proposed that Han Zhenwen, Administrative Commissioner and Commander of the Security Force of the 4th District of Shaanxi Province, should be approved for his resignation, and Zhong Yu, Administrative Commissioner and Commander of the Security Force of the 7th District, should be relieved of his positions as he has other appointments. Zhong Xiangyu was appointed as Administrative Commissioner and Commander of the Security Force of the 4th District of Shaanxi Province, and Xiong Zhengping was appointed as Administrative Commissioner and Commander of the Security Force of the 7th District of Shaanxi Province. The proposal was approved. (Central News Agency telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan approved the Jing-Gan Railway construction bonds on the 24th. It is learned that the total amount is 140 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%, and will be fully repaid by the 35th year of the Republic. The estimated cost of engineering equipment for the railway is 160 million to 180 million yuan. The Ministry of Railways is responsible for raising the shortfall, and construction will begin soon. (Special telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The temporary measures for food regulation were approved at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 24th. The original measures are recorded below: (1) Food should be freely circulated within the country to achieve a balance between supply and demand. The measures proposed by various provinces and cities to restrict food exports are not in line with economic principles and the central government's aim of coordinating food management. Various provinces and cities should immediately cease all bans on transportation. (2) The current market price of food is not significantly different from the same period last year. According to customs reports for the ten months ending in October of this year, exports of rice were only 217,000 dan, wheat was only 264,000 dan, and miscellaneous grains were only 752,000 dan. Imports of rice were 1.824 million dan, grains were 1.238 million dan, and wheat was 1.167 million dan, far exceeding exports. Various miscellaneous grains also had imports of 126,000 dan. There are taxes on food imports and no taxes on exports. The above export figures are accurate. It is not considered necessary to prohibit food exports at this time. In the future, the Ministry of Finance should order the customs authorities to send a list of the types and quantities of food imported and exported each month to the Ministry of Finance. If it is considered necessary to prohibit any type of food, the Ministry of Finance will immediately consult with the Ministry of Finance and submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval to ensure food security.

<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan's meeting on the 24th approved the Jing-Gan Railway construction bonds of 140 million yuan. According to information obtained by this newspaper's reporter, the bonds are intended for the Ministry of Railways to complete the Southeast transport hub connecting the Jing-Gan Railway. The railway connects Jiangnan Road on one side, passing through Ningcheng, Ningguo, Jixi, Shexian, Xiuning, Qimen, Fuliang, and Leping to Guixi, and connects to the Zhe-Gan Railway. The total length of the route is 480 kilometers. The route is rich in products such as timber, paper, Qimen tea, Jingde porcelain, and Poyang minerals. The total engineering and construction material costs are estimated at over 50 million yuan. It has been provisionally agreed to borrow from a syndicate and the Sino-British Gengkuan Board of Trustees. The shortfall will be covered by these construction bonds. The Minister of Railways, Zhang Jiaxuan, has separately consulted with the Traffic Bank, the Farmers Bank, the four joint savings banks, the China &amp; South Sea Bank, the Yien Yieh Commercial Bank, the Kincheng Banking Corporation, the Continental Bank, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and other banks in Shanghai, and all banks have agreed to undertake the underwriting. It is expected that the entire project will be completed in the second half of next year. At that time, once the Nanping section is completed, it will be possible to travel directly from Beijing to Nanchang via Zhejiang and Jiangxi, then connect to the Yue-Han Railway via Pingxiang and Zhuzhou, reaching Guangzhou to the south and Wuhan to the north. It is also heard that the railway will be renamed the Jing-Gan Railway in the future in combination with the Jiangnan Road. (Central News Agency telegram, 24th)</p>

<h3>Wu Donglu Case: We Do Not Violate the Treaty of Commerce, There is No Reason for the Guangdong-Japan Urgent Protest</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) Regarding the case of Wu Donglu, a Taiwanese of Japanese nationality, impersonating a native of Guangdong Province and having a dispute with the owner, a diplomat recently stated that the Japanese consulate protested, believing that this move was our country's implementation of regulations that do not apply to Japanese residents. In fact, the Treaty of Commerce does not prohibit China from promulgating police regulations. If a foreigner violates police regulations, our country's police station may detain and send him to the consulate to which the foreigner belongs, and the local authorities may render judgment under the principle of safeguarding the interests of the people and protecting foreigners. The handling of the Wu Donglu case is very reasonable and does not violate the principles of the Treaty of Commerce. (Central News Agency telegram, 24th)</p>

<h3>Yangtze River Water Level Drops Sharply, Lowest in 35 Years, Shipping Industry Very Concerned</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The recent low water level of the Yangtze River is the lowest in 35 years. The shipping industry operating on the river is at risk of total shutdown. Today's water level has dropped to 5.9 feet, the lowest since 1901, 26 feet lower than this day last year. The shipping industry is very concerned.

<h3>Behind Japan's Huge Military Budget</h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>Japan's budget for the next year has been compiled by the Ministry of Finance on the 22nd and will be submitted to the Cabinet on the 27th for approval. The total amount of the next year's budget compiled by the Ministry of Finance is a massive 3.04 billion yen, an increase of 730 million yen compared to the total budget implemented in Showa 11. This is an unprecedentedly large budget in Japanese history. Of course, the expenditures for the army and navy account for a very large portion of this huge budget, totaling 1.4 billion yen, an increase of 350 million yen over this year. Among them, the army expenditure accounts for 720 million yen, and the navy accounts for 680 million yen.</p>
<p>This massive budget can generally be smoothly passed in the Cabinet meeting on the 27th. Even in the future parliament, it will not be difficult to pass smoothly. Even if the parliament has any objections, it will be useless, because the Hirota cabinet, under the influence of the military, can dissolve the parliament. The past history is the most appropriate explanation.</p>
<p>Japan's defense budget is increasing every year. What is the reason for this increase? In simple terms, it is that Japanese imperialism is actively preparing to participate in a world war. Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has appeared on the world stage as a warrior bear ready for battle. In the past eight years, it has used our land as its military exercise ground. This is a general explanation of the reason for the continuous increase in Japan's defense spending. As for the expenditure of the huge defense budget for the next year, if analyzed, there are the following three relationships.</p>
<p>First, it is the expansion of Japan's military power in China. Since Japan occupied the Eastern Provinces, Japan's army expenditure has increased every year. In particular, the expenditure on the so-called Manchurian Incident has increased even more. In the past year, Japan has again dispatched a large number of troops to be stationed in North China and is preparing to continue its expansion. The recent activities in Suiyuan are an example. This expansion of military power naturally requires a large amount of military expenditure. It is possible that there will also be "North China Incident Expenditure" in the future budget.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty and the London Naval Treaty. Japan will massively expand its naval preparations. Both the Washington and London Naval Treaties will expire at the end of this year. Japan announced its abolition last year and will not continue. The London Naval Conference also had no results due to Japan's withdrawal. Therefore, from next year onwards, Japan's naval power will no longer be bound by the treaty and will be greatly expanded. This again requires a huge amount of military expenditure.</p>
<p>Finally, it is the establishment of the Japan-Germany alliance. In the past one or two years, news of the Japan-Germany alliance has been spread countless times. But recently, this alliance has been formally established. After the establishment of the Japan-Germany alliance, Japan's military preparations against the Soviet Union must be further strengthened. In this way, Japan can take on a part of the responsibility in the future German-Japanese anti-Soviet war. Because of the strengthening of military preparations against the Soviet Union, military expenditures have also greatly increased.</p>
<p>Regardless of the reason for the increase in Japan's defense spending, the results are of great importance to the future of our national liberation. This is something that everyone understands and cannot be ignored.</p>
<h3>Keelung Incident – Question Raised in the British House of Commons</h3>
<p>(London) Today, during the British Foreign Secretary's appearance in the House of Commons, Conservative Party Member Sir Keighley raised a question, stating that if Japan provides a completely satisfactory response regarding the incident of the Japanese police mistreating British sailors in Keelung, will the British government allow the British fleet to continue to visit various Japanese ports for ceremonial visits, or will they still provide due reception to visiting Japanese warships? Mr. Eden replied that in his previous statement regarding this matter, he had clearly stated that a solution to this incident must be arranged first before any mention of visits by warships from both sides. Mr. Eden also stated that he had previously declared in his response in the House of Commons that the United Kingdom cannot consider this incident to be over until the Japanese government provides a satisfactory final response.

<h3>Netherlands, Switzerland and Belgium Join – Three-Nation Currency Agreement – Equal Rights Adjustment Fund – Another Step Towards Currency Stability</h3>
<p>(Paris) In addition to Belgium joining the currency agreement previously established by the United Kingdom, France and the United States, Switzerland and the Netherlands have now also approved it in principle. The Finance Ministries of the United Kingdom, France and the United States recently issued a joint communiqué regarding this matter, stating that the authorities of the six countries, namely the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, will take various technical measures to implement the agreements reached by each country regarding the operation of exchange equalization funds, in order to adjust the monetary policies of each country. (23rd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced today that Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland have joined the currency agreement between the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, effective tomorrow. At that time, the United States will sell gold to the governments of these countries or their financial representatives. This clause for financial representatives differs slightly from the one announced on October 13th because Belgium lacks an equalization fund, so this measure is necessary. However, individuals and private institutions are still excluded from purchasing cash. This currency agreement still allows other countries to join in order to complete the work of international currency balance. The new agreement can also be revised again. The six countries that have already joined enjoy equal rights and have unanimously agreed to avoid currency wars. However, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States will still control the policies of the participating countries, and it is said that the expansion of this agreement will not have any impact on the circulation of gold. (23rd National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(London) The British government issued a statement today, expressing its pleasure at the Netherlands and Swiss governments' agreement to the principles of the British, French, and American currency agreement, and stating that the British government is pleased to learn that the US Treasury Department is now considering giving all the facilities granted to the original participating countries to Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. The British government welcomes this step, as it is in line with everything agreed upon by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and France, and is suitable for the existing mutual cooperation methods between the financial authorities of the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.

<h3>New York Exchange Market Firm – Mysterious and Incomprehensible</h3>
<p>(New York) Foreign exchange rates here were unusually sluggish this morning, but unexpectedly rose sharply in the afternoon and were quite firm. Therefore, international banking circles regard it as mysterious and incomprehensible. Most experts admit that they do not understand the rise of the pound and franc, because with the widespread war rumors in Europe, the prices of British and French currencies should fall, but instead they have risen. According to some well-informed sources, the current abnormal market phenomenon may be a reaction to some behind-the-scenes political developments. According to the stock exchange, the amount of European currency sold is quite moderate, but a large international trading company claims that the amount of foreign exchange sold is unprecedented.

<p>This Year's and Last Year's Nobel Peace Prize Winners</p>
<p>Argentine Foreign Minister Saavedra Lamas – German Pacifist Writer Ossietzky</p>
<p>The Nobel Prize Committee in the capital of Norway has decided to award this year's Peace Prize to Saavedra Lamas, the Foreign Minister of Argentina and former Chairman of the League of Nations General Assembly. The previous year's Peace Prize, which was not awarded at the time, has now been decided to be awarded to the famous German pacifist writer Carl von Ossietzky. Saavedra Lamas proposed the conclusion of the Pan-American Treaty of Conciliation and Non-Aggression in October 1933, which was successively signed and declared established by the American countries, and then promoted to the member states of the League of Nations. To date, more than twenty countries have participated. Subsequently, Saavedra Lamas proposed convening the Chaco Peace Conference in June 1935 to end the dispute between Paraguay and Bolivia, thus contributing to the cause of peace. Ossietzky was detained in a German concentration camp for believing in pacifism in January 1934, for two years. He was only released by German Propaganda Minister Goebbels on the 17th of this month. He is currently suffering from severe pulmonary tuberculosis and is recuperating in a hospital in Magenburg. (24th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Plans to Control Overseas Trade – Promote Commerce and Increase Tax Revenue – Cotton Merchants Oppose Export Tariffs</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government's plan to control and promote overseas trade will be submitted to the National Assembly convened in January next year. It is reported that the contents of the plan include two special types of tax rules, one is an export tariff, which is expected to generate an annual income of £235,000, which will be used to encourage and control Japan's overseas trade, and the other is a statistical tax, which will generate an annual income of £300,000. This tax will be used exclusively for compiling reliable figures for overseas trade. The majority of the plan will be included in the Overseas Trade Control Act and the Overseas Trade Association Act. The Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry has decided to submit the above two cases in the next National Assembly. If the Overseas Trade Control Act is passed by the National Assembly, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry will have the power to forcibly organize associations, so that manufacturers and traders across the country can form a standing committee to promote harmony between producers and traders, and, when necessary, implement a licensing system for import and export merchants, focusing on controlling the following types of goods. Even if export tariffs are levied, the rate will not be too high, but the types of goods included may be very broad. According to the Ministry of Finance, the implementation of this export tariff can reduce the malpractice of cheap dumping of Japanese goods abroad, and it is believed that the burden of this low tax will be borne by foreign people who consume Japanese goods. The various export goods currently included in the control list, calculated at last year's value, amount to 390,000,000 Japanese yen. At present, exporters engaged in cotton weaving and rayon fabrics are extremely concerned about the above-mentioned export tariffs and have decided to start a movement to prevent the tax from being established. The reason they express their opposition is that this is a plan of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, which is entirely aimed at increasing revenue reduction. The so-called encouragement of trade is just a euphemism. (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Finance Minister Explains – Financial Policy – Seeking to Increase Natural Revenue – Expanding Control and Supervision Rights</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The total expenditure budget for the next year exceeds 3 billion, and nearly 1 billion in new public bonds will be issued. Therefore, all parties are paying close attention to the implementation of future financial plans. Finance Minister Kakuma clarified the financial policy for the future on the 24th as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The budget for the next year has reached a considerable amount because it enriches national defense, promotes industrial trade, and stabilizes the national life. It is based on the increase of national wealth, so it intends to increase natural revenue. (1) The issuance of 1 billion yen in new public bonds annually does not cause any anxiety from the perspective of current absorption capacity. (1) The financial plan for the future takes industrial trade policy as its foundation and focuses on increasing the increase in natural revenue.

<h3>US Seamen – Strike Expands – Affects Atlantic Coast – Shipping Losses are Significant</h3>
<p>(New York) Four thousand merchant ship employees on the Atlantic coast have gone on strike in response to the strike movement of seamen in Pacific ports. Another 12,000 merchant ship employees are also likely to join the strike. The US seamen's strike has lasted for three weeks and has not yet been resolved. The losses suffered by the shipping industry are estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars, and food supplies to the Hawaiian Islands have also been affected. (23rd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>San Francisco – Mexican central troops were deployed at the dock in Ensenada, Baja California, today to prevent American sailors from interfering with the unloading of cargo from the Grace Shipping Company's steamer "Santa Elena." Five strike leaders were arrested in advance and asked to return to the United States. Leaders in the Pilots, Engineers, and Assistants Association here have ordered all members to join the strike in response to the ports on the Atlantic and Mexican Gulf coasts, which are likely to be implemented soon. Therefore, the seamen's strike has affected the entire country. However, leaders of the mutual aid association in Houston claim that their strike has nothing to do with the seamen's strike.

<h3>Two Factions of US Labor Unions Confront Each Other – Mediation is Conducted to Recover the Deadlock</h3>
<p>The Congress of Industrial Organizations in Dunbar, Florida, in the United States, has been divided into two factions, one including ten labor unions, led by Lewis, chairman of the Miners' Union, and the other still led by Green, chairman of the Congress of Industrial Organizations. They have been confronting each other for several months. When the Congress of Industrial Organizations held a conference in August of this year, it passed a resolution to temporarily suspend the membership of the members of each of the ten labor unions, thus making the two factions even more incompatible. By the time the Congress of Industrial Organizations held another conference on the 15th of this month, none of Lewis's faction attended. Although Chairman Green advised them in advance, it was still ineffective. The conference therefore passed a resolution on this day to extend the suspension of membership of each of the labor unions indefinitely, and authorized the executive committee to conduct mediation again in order to recover the deadlock. However, if mediation is ineffective, the executive committee should convene a temporary conference to re-discuss the countermeasures. (23rd Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Romanian Foreign Minister Visits Poland</h3>
<p>Capital of Romania – Colonel Beck, the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, visited Romania in 1934. Romanian Foreign Minister Antonescu is now departing for Warsaw this morning to return the visit. He will stop briefly in Krakow, Poland, to pay his respects at the tomb of the former military and political leader, General Piłsudski, and place a wreath. Romania and Poland were originally allied countries. Recently, since the alliance between Poland and France has strengthened, the relationship between Romania and Poland has become closer. The purpose of Antonescu's trip is to further strengthen the alliance between Romania and Poland, so that Poland and the other two countries of the Little Entente can also cooperate. In addition, Antonescu will also hold talks with Colonel Beck on various issues such as culture, economy, and tourism. (24th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Germany Appoints – Commercial Representative to Manchuria</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Well-informed sources recently stated that the government has appointed Dr. Knore, former commercial counselor at the German Embassy in Japan, as Germany's commercial representative to "Manchukuo." The representative will take office in the shortest possible time. The German government previously sent an economic delegation to the Far East in January of this year (led by Dr. Knopp), and Knore was a member of the delegation. (24th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Seeks to Develop – Qingdao Market</h3>
<p>Osaka – Mr. Otani, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry's correspondent in Qingdao, stated at the Osaka business roundtable meeting that the development of various industries in China is gradually increasing and will soon pose a serious threat to Japan. Since the implementation of the national tax rules in China, its industries have progressed very rapidly. Taking Japanese cotton goods in Re-Island as an example, the quantity sold only reaches 10% of the total consumption, and it is feared that Japanese goods will be completely rejected in the future. The sundries industry in China is currently very active, and 60% of the demand for enamel products and thermos bottles is supplied locally. Otani suggested that Japanese merchants should focus on the machinery and raw materials needed by China to revitalize its industries in the future. He also mentioned that dyes, wool fabrics, and cultural products are easy to sell. Otani further stated that if Japanese merchants carefully study China's tax rules, they will be able to find other opportunities. (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Vicinity of Madrid: Rain and Snow Intermingle, Fighting Temporarily Ceases</h3>
<p>Madrid: Today, due to the combination of rain and snow, fighting cannot proceed. The government declares that rebel forces are still in the university district. The militia takes advantage of the lull in fighting to assist civilians in relocating. Art treasures and valuable scientific objects in the capital have all been moved to safe locations. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The fighting here has been quiet for four days. Today, the sound of rebel artillery and bombs resumed with great intensity. The two armies' artillery units exchanged fire outside the city to cover the advance of tanks and infantry. (Guomin News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>Madrid: Last night, the Nationalist army resumed shelling the city center, with many shells landing, causing significant damage and numerous casualties. While clearing rubble from the site of a printing house recently destroyed by an airstrike, 70 corpses were unearthed. It is believed that another 20 remain buried in the rubble. The exact number of casualties from the recent air raids remains unknown until all the destroyed buildings have been thoroughly searched. The greatest fear is that many were hiding in cellars and were buried alive when the cellars collapsed. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Seville: Tonight, according to a broadcast from an unmonitored radio station, a Nationalist army aircraft dropped a large bomb on the Army Headquarters in Madrid, which stored a large quantity of ammunition, resulting in a huge explosion followed by a large fire. The flames were visible from the Nationalist army lines and lasted for several hours. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>Twelve Submarines of a Certain Country Attack Spanish Cruisers: Government Communiqué Accuses Germany and Italy; Britain and France Decide to Maintain Strict Neutrality, Still Not Recognizing Belligerent Groups</h3>
<p>(London) The diplomatic circles have been very active for the past two days due to receiving reliable reports that when the Spanish government warship Cervantes was attacked yesterday, a German light cruiser and a destroyer were present outside the port of Cartagena. The Spanish ambassador here, Asgaralade, claimed ignorance of the matter but stated that, based on recent reports from Madrid, the attack seemed to be carried out by Italian submarines. An investigation has been launched today. (Guomin News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>Valencia: The government held a seven-hour meeting today and subsequently issued a communiqué accusing Italy and Germany, stating that since the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, the warships of the two countries have been patrolling the Spanish coast, "which is quite contrary to the obligations of neutral countries." (Guomin News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>Valencia: Regarding the attack on the government cruiser outside the port of Cartagena on the southeast coast by submarines, the Navy Department issued a communiqué late yesterday, accusing the German and Italian fleets of obviously aiding the rebel forces, and stating that as many as twelve foreign submarines were involved in the attack on the government cruisers Cervantes and Mendez Nunez. The details are as follows: Initially, the cruisers Cervantes, Mendez Nunez, and Jaime I were all docked in the port of Cartagena. At 9:00 AM yesterday, twelve submarines suddenly launched torpedoes at them. One torpedo hit the Cervantes on its outer hull and detonated immediately. The Mendez Nunez and Jaime I were not hit. As the rebel forces do not possess submarines, and the naval base of Cartagena is under the control of the government forces, it is impossible for the rebel forces to build submarines in that port. Therefore, the attackers of the government cruisers must be foreign submarines without a doubt. Upon inspection of the torpedo that hit the cruiser Cervantes, it was determined that it was neither made in Spain nor in Italy. However, when the submarines attacked the ship, a German destroyer was docked outside the port. Afterwards, the German ship even entered the port to conduct reconnaissance. There are clues to be found in this. (Havas News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Valencia: The Army Department here issued a communiqué explicitly accusing the warships of Italy and Germany of assisting the rebel fleet, stating that Italian and German ships are constantly scouting the movements of the Spanish government fleet to report their actions to the rebel forces. It also claimed that a German cable ship laid mines in the port of Bilbao. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) At today's meeting of the House of Commons, members of parliament asked Foreign Secretary Eden about the dangerous international situation in Spain. After explaining the government's policy of strict neutrality, the Foreign Secretary declared that the government would prohibit British ships from carrying munitions to Spain. He has informed the French Ambassador to Britain, Corbin, of British policy. In the past 24 hours, the French government has expressed its hope that the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War will continue to operate as usual. The Foreign Secretary continued that the Foreign Office has not received any notification from the Spanish Nationalist army of its intention to blockade any port. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to those responsible, France's position on the Spanish situation has not changed. In other words, France will continue to adhere to the Non-Intervention Agreement and does not intend to recognize either side of the Spanish Civil War as belligerent groups. Regarding the non-recognition of belligerent groups, France's decision is in complete agreement with the decision of the British Cabinet announced by British Foreign Secretary Eden in the House of Commons this afternoon. In recent days, the British and French governments have held talks on this matter, and these talks have shown that the viewpoints of the British and French are completely aligned. (Havas News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>France and Russia Also Plan to Send Warships to Protect Merchant Shipping; British Arms Embargo Bill Introduced in the House of Commons; Spanish Rebel Army Responds to the Port Blockade Issue</h3>
<p>(Paris) The government has ordered the Navy Department to take necessary precautions to protect French ships in Spanish waters. French authorities believe that the Spanish rebel forces should not be allowed to blockade the port of Barcelona because no country has yet granted the Franco government the rights of a formal belligerent. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) The Associated Press learned today that Soviet Russia is planning to dispatch warships to escort merchant ships sailing in Spanish territorial waters. (Guomin News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) As a sign of its sincerity, Britain is about to draft a bill to strictly prohibit the transportation of arms to Spain. Foreign Secretary Eden had previously declared that he intended to implement this bill soon to ensure Britain's adherence to neutrality. The bill has been scheduled to be submitted to the House of Commons on Wednesday. It stipulates that British ships transporting arms to any Spanish seaport from any port in the world will be criminally prosecuted. Currently, Britain can only prohibit its ships from exporting arms from Britain, but recent reports have repeatedly indicated that British ships often transport arms to Spain from foreign ports. Therefore, stricter regulations are necessary. The stipulated penalties are quite severe and are enough to deter the general shipping industry. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) After the Spanish Nationalist government prepared to blockade the port of Barcelona and bombard it, the British government immediately instructed Sir Chilton, the British ambassador to Spain, to negotiate to delineate a safe zone in the port. According to the Daily Express correspondent in Hendaye, France, General Franco has sent a reply to Ambassador Chilton, the contents of which designate safe zones in the Spanish ports of Cartagena, Valencia, Alicante, and Tarragona for British ships to dock. However, it does not mention the port of Barcelona. Ambassador Chilton deemed this response unsatisfactory and immediately requested General Franco to provide further clarification.

<h3>American Embassy Withdraws Yesterday, Relocates to Valencia</h3>

<p>(Washington) The American Embassy in Spain has been ordered by the State Department today to lower its flag and withdraw from Madrid. There are still 150 American citizens there who had been repeatedly warned to leave the war zone. Now they have no place to seek refuge. After receiving the order from the State Department, Third Secretary Wendellin telegraphed that he expected to leave Madrid within three days and travel by car to Valencia to establish a temporary embassy.

<h3>London Submarine Treaty Stipulates Humanization of Warfare; Germany Also Signs</h3>
<p>(Berlin) After the representatives of Britain, France, the United States, Italy, Japan, and the British Dominions and India signed the protocol on the "Humanization of Submarine Warfare" on the 6th of this month, the German government has now also signed it. The Berliner Tageblatt commented: "Regarding the naval agreement concluded between Britain and Germany in June of last year, external critics have often said that this agreement has lost its creative force and is unlikely to achieve anything. Now that Germany has joined the above protocol, those who hold this view will naturally retreat in disappointment, and the British-German naval agreement remains a guarantee of European peace, as evidenced once again." (Havas News Agency, 24th)</p>
<h3>Italy and Germany Declare No Material Assistance; Will Support the Rebel Army's Port Blockade Issue in Spirit</h3>
<p>(Rome) Italian officials admitted today that Italy is prepared to adopt a strict plan in principle to prevent Soviet Russia from supplying the Spanish government forces and establishing a Red Republic in Spain. It is also heard that General Franco, Chairman of the Spanish Nationalist government, is about to bomb and blockade Barcelona in early next week. Public opinion here firmly believes that the international disputes gradually arising from the Spanish Civil War will become a touchstone for the European peace organization. (Guomin News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to reports here today, Italy will provide spiritual support to General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Nationalist army, in his blockade of Spanish ports. However, Italy has not provided material assistance in the past and intends to continue to do so in the future, and will continue to uphold the principle of non-intervention. This attitude is a natural result of Italy's recognition of the Spanish Nationalist government. People here all say that General Franco's actions to prevent Soviet Russia from transporting arms to Spanish ports are completely reasonable and vehemently deny that Italian submarines attacked Spanish government warships. According to official announcements, Italy has not sold or lent any submarines to General Franco. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) The fact that British Foreign Secretary Eden announced in the House of Commons that Britain does not want to grant the rights of maritime belligerents to any side in the Spanish Civil War has surprised many people here, because according to reports in Italian newspapers, readers were led to believe that Britain was about to grant such rights. Foreign Secretary Eden also explained that the British government's policy is to not interfere in the Spanish Civil War, so if necessary, British warships will protect British ships outside the three-mile territorial sea limit to reject interference from any side. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Officials here dismissed as nonsense the Spanish government's accusations that German warships attacked Spanish government warships and that German ships scouted the movements of the two ships. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Salamanca: The Italian Chargé d'Affaires in Burgos, Descontes, and the German Chargé d'Affaires, General Foeppel, arrived here after being hosted by General Deriano, Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Route of the Nationalist army, in Seville yesterday. They will soon go to Burgos to take up their new posts. (Havas News Agency, 24th)</p>
<h3>New French Aircraft Conduct Flight Tests; Chinese and Japanese Representatives Invited to Observe</h3>
<p>(Paris) Several of the latest French Air Force aircraft recently conducted test flights at the Villacoublay airfield. Diplomatic representatives from China and Japan were invited to observe the event. (Havas News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Torpedoing of Cruiser Arouses Attention in Britain and France; Non-Intervention Committee Discusses Surveillance Plan</h3>
<p>(London) Political circles here are extremely concerned about the explosion that occurred on the Spanish government warship Cervantes in the port of Cartagena in southeastern Spain the other day. According to a statement issued by the Spanish Embassy in Britain, the explosion was caused by a torpedo launched by a submarine or destroyer of unknown nationality. Reports from the British naval authorities in Gibraltar also corroborate this information. Although the Nationalist authorities in Burgos claimed that the ship was hit by a Nationalist submarine, the Nationalist army only has one submarine, so this claim is difficult to believe. It is generally believed that the theory of a foreign submarine or destroyer is more credible. (Havas News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) It was learned here today that if Germany and Italy had indeed "loaned" submarines to the Spanish rebels to attack the government cruiser Cervantes, France would demand that all signatories to the Washington Naval Treaty pay attention, as this would be a direct violation of the treaty. (Guomin News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The famous journalist Saint-Brice recently commented in Le Journal on the attack on the Spanish government cruiser Cervantes by a submarine, stating, "Italy wants to move closer to Britain in the Mediterranean. According to Article 18 of the Washington Naval Treaty, Italy may not sell warships to other countries before the expiration of the treaty, i.e., before January 1, 1937. (Article 18 stipulates that each contracting party acknowledges that it will not dispose of any warship by donation, sale, or other means of transfer, so that the warship becomes a warship of another country's navy.) Therefore, the incident of the Cervantes being attacked by a submarine outside the port of Cartagena is extremely peculiar. One recalls that the American cruiser Maine exploded and sank in Havana Harbor on February 15, 1898, which immediately triggered the war between the United States and Spain. Is the Cervantes the second Maine?" (Havas News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) The subcommittee established by the Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee on the Spanish Civil War met this afternoon to discuss the surveillance plan for ports, borders, and airfields within the territories of the two parties involved in the Spanish Civil War. The surveillance plan for airfields had just been drafted by several air attachés stationed in Britain. Representatives of the countries present at today's subcommittee meeting decided to forward the plan to their respective governments for review. Representatives from Britain, the Soviet Union, and several other countries advocated that the surveillance plan for ports and borders should be immediately sent to the authorities in Madrid and Burgos. However, representatives from Italy, Germany, and Portugal refused, stating that the entire surveillance plan should be sent to both parties involved in the Spanish Civil War only after it is completed. The subcommittee is scheduled to continue its meeting on the 27th of this month to decide on this matter. The majority of the national representatives were quite displeased with the position adopted by Germany, Italy, and Portugal, believing that the implementation of the surveillance system would inevitably be delayed according to the proposals made by the three countries. It is also generally believed that if the surveillance plan for ports and borders were sent to the two parties involved in the Spanish Civil War now, General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist army, would inevitably reject it. If so, his position would inevitably be criticized by European public opinion. Now, due to the opposition of Germany, Italy, and Portugal, the surveillance plan does not have to be rejected by the Nationalist army, but it has been delayed in implementation in an invisible way.

<h3>Bandits and Puppets Invade Suizhong; Someone is Busy Conveying Messages; Senior Staff Travel Between Tianjin, Chengde, and Changchun; Manchukuo Army Plans a Large-Scale Incursion into Eastern and Northern Suiyuan; Provincial Militia Defends the Homeland and Achieves Remarkable Successes</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: In the battle of Honggetu on the 18th, the Suiyuan army fully demonstrated its spirit of "military prowess." The main force of the bandit army, Wang Ying, was defeated by our army, suffering heavy losses and no longer able to form a division. It retreated to the rear of Shangdu to reorganize. Although there have been battles between Xinghe and Taolin in recent days, they are all reconnaissance skirmishes. Contact with the main force has been prevented because the bandit's reinforcement troops have not yet fully arrived and will not do so for at least a week. Although a certain party has repeatedly stated that the Suiyuan incident has nothing to do with them, on the 19th, they sent senior staff officer Harada Yoshikazu and aviation squadron leader Iijima to Tianjin to contact the commander of the garrison here. On the 20th, they flew to Chengde to meet with the head of the garrison of that party, and then flew back to Changchun on the same day to report. The Kwantung Army headquarters convened a meeting of senior officers of all the garrisons in Manchukuo on the same day for important discussions. Ishihara, chief of the Operations Section of the Tokyo General Staff, also accompanied several colleagues to Changchun on the 21st to convey the intentions of the central authorities and exchange opinions. On the 25th and 26th, they flew to Tianjin to give the same instructions to the garrison commander. Therefore, the total attack by the bandits and puppets, originally scheduled for the 21st, was suddenly postponed, probably to wait for this exchange of opinions and decisions before launching.</p>
<p>In Suiyuan, there are widespread rumors that Prince De's situation is very difficult. In the first place, he has become a tiger to ride, and in the near future, he has been forced to act. He has quite a bit of remorse. A few days ago, he led 300 of his trusted puppet troops and suddenly returned from Bailingmiao to Xisuzhuang, where he will issue a statement declaring his attitude. This is supported by the fact that Wang Ying was defeated and refused entry to Shangdu, and cried loudly. It is reasonable that Prince De is unwilling to be an oppressed puppet. However, in Wuchuan, the Mongol puppet autonomous army has gathered several thousand troops, claiming to be tens of thousands, and will take Guyang and Wuchuan as their targets of invasion. They plan to wait for the arrival of the Wang Ying and Li Shouxin bandit puppet reinforcements to coordinate properly and launch a general offensive in one fell swoop. Since the 21st, troops have been moving busily between Duolun, Bailingmiao, and Shangdu. It is reported that the puppet troops belonging to Yu Shencheng and Ji Xing of the puppet Manchukuo First and Second Military Regions have sent several thousand troops each to be stationed on the Wuchuan, Taolin, and Xinghe fronts, as the main force of the upcoming offensive. Therefore, our defensive work has become more cautious. The bandit puppet army is focusing on northern Suiyuan, and the future fierce battle of attack and defense will be between Wuchuan and Guyang.</p>
<p>The Suiyuan National Army, trained by General Fu Zuoyi, is persevering, hard-working, and resilient. The skill of defending Zhuozhou for three months in previous years has not yet been forgotten. The ability to remain calm and composed in the face of the enemy is its strength. In the battle of Honggetu, Wang Ying's bandit army had already achieved a complete encirclement. Our left and right flanks were under its towering threat. In the bandit's estimation, it was not impossible to break through in a day or two. Fortunately, our division commander Peng Yubin moved with lightning speed, turning defense into offense and launching a counterattack against the puppet forces. The bandit puppets were caught off guard and suffered a great defeat and rout. Even important documents of its headquarters were not taken away. The extent of the damage can be imagined. Xinghe and Taolin are prosperous areas in eastern Suiyuan, lands of fish and rice. Since this summer, Fu Zuoyi's army has punished the bandit forces for their arrogance and is bound to come and harass them. All the magistrates of the five counties along the border have been replaced by military personnel, and strong men have been selected and trained as militia, and firearms have been distributed to them. In peacetime, they watch and help each other, and in times of trouble, they take up arms to defend the border. The deep planning and decisive actions have resulted in significant assistance in the current battle. While the army is responsible for the defense of Xinghe and Taolin, the strength of the militia is not small. When Peng's division and Dong's brigade of Honggetu chased the fleeing enemy troops, the militia also followed up and attacked bravely and skillfully, no less than the regular army. Each time the puppet army comes to harass, it has reservations when passing through a village or town, only fearing that there are teams ambushed there. Therefore, during their rout, they must also set fire to burn everything as a pleasure. When the bandits launched an attack on the 15th, they originally planned to have the First Army detour to the Ping-Sui Railway to cut off the Fengzhen connection, but they failed to succeed, because the isolated army did not dare to go deep, and feared that our militia would intercept and cut off their retreat.

<h3>Puppet Bandits in Shangdu are Already Disheartened; After Wang Ying's Defeat, his Regiment Commander Zhao Dazhong was Shot; The Gates of Shangdu are Tightly Closed, and the People are Extremely Disappointed with the Bandit Puppets</h3>
<p>Zhangbei Correspondence: Zhang Wanqing, brigade commander of Wang Ying's bandit troops, led the bandit puppets from Nanhaogian on the 18th of this month to invade Xinghe in eastern Suiyuan. The fierce fighting was very intense. The attack on the 19th also failed and suffered heavy losses. On the 20th, they retreated to the northwest positions of Yuhe, reorganizing their military strength and attempting to invade the west again. Li Shouxin's unit of 1,600 men arrived at Nanhaogian to assist Zhang's rebellion. On the same day, 10 heavy trucks carrying firearms and ammunition were transported from Zhangbei to Nanhaogian to supply Zhang's bandit troops. There are still more than 100 puppet soldiers in Zhangbei city, and only more than 300 outside the city.</p>
<p>Wang Ying Cries to his Subordinates</p>
<p>According to people from Shangdu, since Wang Ying and Li Shouxin jointly attacked the Honggetu area of Taolin from Shangdu on the 11th of this month, they have suffered repeated heavy losses. The wounded soldiers stationed in the city have reached more than 200, and there are still some who have not been transported. On the 18th and 19th, Wang and Li's units suffered heavy losses. When Wang Ying retreated eastward from Honggetu, when he reached Tuchengzi, he saw the embarrassing situation of his bandit puppets being pursued by the Suiyuan army. He was extremely angry and distressed, and couldn't help but cry out to his subordinates. Because his regiment commander Zhao Dazhong failed to attack effectively, he immediately shot Zhao to vent his anger. Then, two of Wang's orderlies, who had been guarding 20,000 yuan in cash for Wang, took advantage of the chaos of the defeat and carried the money away, and their whereabouts are currently unknown. The gates of Shangdu have been tightly closed since the 20th to prevent defeated soldiers from entering the city and looting, and to prevent Wang Ying's troops stationed in the city from fleeing. There are currently two regiments of Li Shouxin's troops in the city. There are 20 aircraft parked at the airfield. The bandits' meals are all levied from the local area. On the 19th, the bandit puppets ordered the county government to levy 10,000 catties of buckwheat flour from each district, but the official price given was only 1% of the current value. The people are extremely resentful and hope that the Suiyuan army will attack Shangdu as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Troops of a Certain Party Advance Westward in Succession</p>
<p>Because the bandit puppets invaded Suiyuan and suffered a crushing defeat, their ambitions will never be restrained by this. Now, more than 10,000 troops of a certain party and bandit troops from Rehe have arrived in Duolun day after day, and are gradually advancing westward from Duolun. In addition, in terms of military supplies, a certain party is also fully supplying the bandit puppets. On the 20th, a large number of military supplies and gasoline were transported from Duolun to Zhangbei. On the same day, 12 heavy trucks carrying gasoline were transported from Zhangbei to Kangbao. It is reported that there were also 16 heavy trucks directly transporting wooden boxes, four feet long and wide, from Duolun to Kangbao. The boxes were extremely heavy, but it is not known what was contained inside. According to claims by the people of Kangbao, since the 15th of this month, more than 200 civilian carts have been requisitioned by the bandit puppets. Judging from the above situation, if the Suiyuan army can launch an attack and recover Shangdu, it will become the center of military affairs. (21st)</p>
<h3>The Changli False Peacekeeping Force Rebels: Zhang Guogan's Unit Incited by Chi Zongmo and Li Haiting; Japanese Military Captain Commits Suicide Due to Negligence</h3>
<p>Tianjin dispatch: Zhang Guogan's unit, the Second Battalion of the Sixth District Team of the Third General Detachment of the Changli False Jidong Peacekeeping Force, consisting of 460 men, suddenly rebelled at 6:00 PM on the 20th. On the morning of the 23rd, the Japanese garrison stationed in Shanhaiguan assisted the False Third and Fourth Peacekeeping General Detachments in pursuing the rebels, and the matter was resolved at Dongyang Village between Fengrun and Yutian.</p>
<p>The details of the incident are as follows: The False Jidong Peacekeeping Third General Detachment was originally the unit of the deceased Liu Zuozhou. After Liu's death, it was led by Li Haiting. Three months ago, Li conspired with Zhao Lei, with the suggestion of Chi Zongmo, Secretary-General of the False Government, to unite and overthrow Yin Rugeng. Yin learned of this, and preemptively removed Li and transferred Li Yunsheng, commander of the False Peacekeeping Fifth General Detachment, to take over. Although Li Haiting was removed, he remained resentful. Recently, he continued to plot in Tianjin with Chi Zongmo, Zhao Lei, and others, inciting the old troops to mutiny, taking the opportunity to overthrow Yin. In the middle of this month, the First Battalion of the False Fifth District Team stationed in Changli rebelled and fled outside the Great Wall to become bandits. Zhang Guogan, the Second Battalion Commander of the False Sixth District Team, was originally a regimental commander under Shi Yousan. Shi is now the Commander of the Northern Hebei Peacekeeping Force, and Zhang wanted to lead his troops to join Shi. Taking advantage of the incitement by Li Haiting and others, Zhang harbored an unstable mind. The matter was discovered by the False Government, which dispatched Han Zexin, commander of the False Fourth Peacekeeping General Detachment of Tangshan, and Hirai, a Japanese advisor to the False Peacekeeping Department, along with Sakurai, the Japanese military police captain of Changli, to mediate. They planned to transfer the False unit to Tangshan and place it under the command of Han Zexin. The terms had been agreed upon, and they were scheduled to depart at 6:00 PM on the 20th. Several tens of thousands of yuan of departure expenses were issued. They boarded the 44th passenger-freight mixed train between Tangshan and Yulin at Changli Station to go to Tangshan. Unexpectedly, after the unit boarded the train, some people monitored the engine driver, forcing him to drive quickly and not stop at any stations along the way. At around 7:00 PM, they arrived at the Wuli small station between Tangshan and Ping, and forced the train to stop. Zhang Guogan then ordered his troops to cut off the station's telephone lines, guard the station building, and seize five rifles and three pistols from the guards and station police on the train and platform. The railway staff was imprisoned in the guard car, and Sakurai, Hirai, and Han Zexin were also monitored. They then looted all the passengers' belongings and valuables, leaving nothing behind. By 8:00 PM, the Tangshan False Peacekeeping Force, upon receiving the report, dispatched a battalion to rush to the scene and opened fire with the rebel unit, engaging in a fierce battle for dozens of minutes. The rebel unit fled towards Fengrun and Luanxian. The Tangshan False Peacekeeping Force pursued them relentlessly. Han Zexin and the other two were taken away by the rebel troops. The 44th train arrived in Tangshan at around 10:00 PM. The Beining Railway, in response to the innocent losses suffered by the passengers, specially purchased food and drinks to distribute and allowed them to take the next train to their destinations. The Japanese troops stationed in Tangshan, Yuguan, and Tianjin, upon receiving the report, separately dispatched teams of several hundred infantry and artillery soldiers, and special trains were sent to Fengrun and Luanxian to intercept the rebels. The Japanese Army Headquarters in Tianjin also dispatched Staff Officer Kazuo and Military Police Squad Leader Ikeue to Changli on a special train at 2:00 AM on the 21st to investigate. On the railway side, in addition to the loss of firearms by the railway police, trains traveling between Ping and Yulin that night all ran with a clearing train ahead to prevent danger. On the 22nd, the rebel army once fled to the mountains at the border of Aofeng, where they were besieged by Japanese and False troops. On the morning of the 23rd, they broke through the encirclement and fled towards Yutian, intending to go to Tongzhou and then to Beiping to join Shi Yousan. However, they were still pursued by the Japanese and False troops and were disarmed in a major encirclement at Dongyang Village. They were immediately sent to Changli to await reorganization or dismissal. Sakurai and the other two were rescued at that time. However, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Shanhaiguan, Kojima, felt responsible because Changli was within his territory and the False Peacekeeping Force had repeatedly rebelled, but he had failed to prevent it in advance. Therefore, at 10:00 AM on the 23rd, after the rebels were disarmed, he committed suicide by disembowelment in Dongyang Village. He did not die immediately. Upon receiving the report, the Japanese Army Headquarters in Tianjin urgently dispatched the Second Infantry Regiment Commander Kayashima and Adjutant Kawada, leading eleven military policemen, to Tangshan on a special train at 12:00 PM to investigate. Their troops had already returned to defend on the evening of the 23rd. (November 23rd)</p>
<h3>Social Life in Fuzhou: Residents Sell All Their Gold, Used Clothing Prices Suddenly Rise</h3>
<p>Fuzhou dispatch: Various industries in this province have been sluggish in recent years, especially the gold and silver jewelry industry. Gold and silver utensils are only necessary for weddings and funerals. People can only afford them if they have surplus money beyond food and clothing. Therefore, since last year, the business of various gold shops has been changed to collecting gold ornaments, melting them into bars, and selling them in Shanghai. It is estimated that each tael of gold in Fuzhou can be bought for 110 yuan and sold for 120 yuan in Shanghai. Therefore, they are making a profit. So, several new gold shops have opened in the market. As of the end of June this year, more than 100,000 taels of gold have been shipped to Shanghai. Since July, the amount of gold collected has been minimal, with only a few hundred taels exported each month. Because people's gold savings are almost exhausted, the gold shop business has become sluggish. Recently, there have been repeated incidents of insufficient purity being discovered in exchanged gold ornaments. The brand marks on the gold ornaments, such as Guanyin Jing Yuanquan Hao, and the earpicks and glutinous rice ball clasps found in Nanda Road Tianquan Hao, do not match the seals used by Tianquan Hao. Yongxiang Hao in Zhongting Street discovered goldware of insufficient purity from their own shop. Although they all denied that they were made by their shop, the technique of having a high purity exterior but a low purity interior is not something that people outside the industry can do easily. Currently, the gold and silver industry association is investigating the inside story to prevent its future business from being affected. In addition, the pawnshop business in this city used to suffer losses because clothing styles changed frequently and prices fell. When pawned clothes reached their expiration date and were sold as unclaimed items, most pawnshops lost money, which often led to pawnshop closures. Therefore, they changed their business strategy, reducing the value of pawned items. Women's shirts and artificial silk are not accepted for pawning. They also established a sales market for unclaimed items. All originally pawned items are sold to used clothing stores after 18 months (at a price 30% lower than the pawn value, such as clothes pawned for one yuan being sold for only 70 cents). Not only is there no interest earned, but the capital is also lost. Since last year, the price of these unclaimed clothes has gradually increased, and currently they can exceed 30% of the original pawned capital (i.e., items pawned for one yuan can be sold for more than 1.3 yuan). There is already interest to be earned, and used clothing stores still need to increase the price to sell. Therefore, the price of winter clothes this year is especially high, and the cloth quality is even more expensive. Because the areas outside the county are peaceful and people who fled to avoid bandits have mostly returned home, and the late rice harvest is also very abundant, sales are quite smooth.

<h3>Daylight Robbery of Transportation Boat</h3>
<p>At 8:00 AM on the 23rd, the Zhangpu wheel boat left the pier. At around 9:00 AM, when it arrived at Xiaolv River outside Xiaoximen, three bandits in a boat suddenly opened fire with pistols and ordered the boat to dock. The boat owner, Xia Yuxiang, had no choice but to stop. The bandits then boarded the boat and searched the passengers one by one. More than 700 yuan in legal currency were robbed. The bandits fled west.</p>
<h3>Road Maintenance Team Organized and Established</h3>
<p>The road maintenance teams of various districts in this county have been organized and completed. According to statistics, there are a total of 446 teams in the county. They are now undergoing a week of training before being assigned to serve.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Strictly Prohibiting Illegal Business</h3>
<p>There is a special type of business in this county that specializes in acting as an agent for people to buy and sell short in the exchange, without any actual goods being traded. It is an illegal business. Clerks from middle-class shops flock to it. Once they lose money, those with financial resources are ruined, and those without financial resources abscond with embezzled funds, harming the shop owners and affecting the entire market, which is not a minor matter. Yesterday, the county chamber of commerce sent a letter to the county government, requesting a public announcement to strictly prohibit it and asking the Public Security Bureau to pay attention at any time, investigate, and crack down on it to prevent speculation and stabilize business. At the same time, the association also sent separate letters to various trade associations, stating that price cuts and competitive sales among peers are also sufficient to harm legitimate business. The various trade associations should, based on the established industry rules, discuss and formulate measures to stop them based on the actual situation and report to the association for handling at any time.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: Fifteen Homes Burned Down in Ximen</h3>
<p>At Shigongtou outside the west gate of this city, a fire alarm suddenly went off at 5:00 PM on the 18th. The gongs were sounded to raise the alarm, and all the water dragons arrived at the scene to try their best to put out the fire. However, the fire was extremely fierce and spread for up to two hours before being extinguished. It is estimated that more than 30 houses belonging to the Zhao, Chen, and Jin families were burned down, and all the clothes and utensils of each family were reduced to ashes. Eight or nine stacks of hay were also burned down, worth eight or nine hundred yuan. The total estimated loss is more than 2,000 yuan. It is said that the fire started in the Zhao family. Because there had been no rain for a long time, it was very easy for a fire to start.</p>
<h3>Jiashan: Two Traitors Arrested</h3>
<p>The Yiyong Police of Fengjing Town discovered two men dressed as workers in blue short shirts and trousers at the Yong'an Inn a few days ago. Their behavior was strange. They immediately reported to the Public Security Bureau, which sent police to arrest them and take them to the bureau. After Director He Yinting interrogated them once, they confessed to being traitors without denying it. Their purpose was to go to Gan Province. Director He immediately sent the criminals to the county for detention.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Yin Ci Directly Connected to Electricity</h3>
<p>Since taking over the Cixi Ciming Electric Light Company, the Yongyao Electric Light Company in this port has been preparing for the direct connection of Yin Ci to electricity and setting up construction projects, which will still take time. Therefore, the Ciming Company brand is temporarily still in use. Now that the newly purchased machine has been installed, and the wooden poles for the long-distance power lines between Yin Ci and the urban and rural areas of Ci County have also been replaced, the Ciming brand will be changed to the Ningbo Yongyao Electric Light Resident Ci Branch Company. It is scheduled to transmit electricity directly at the end of next month.</p>
<h3>Major Fire in An Er Villages in Northern Ci</h3>
<p>In the Weijia area of ​​An Er Village in northern Ci, the elderly woman Wei Weng did not take precautions against fire in her residence. Because she did not call for help, she fetched water and poured it alone, which led to a prairie fire. After the fire broke out, fire brigades from various places rushed to the rescue upon hearing the alarm, but it was not easy to extinguish. It took three hours to extinguish the fire. The families with the heaviest losses in the neighborhood were the Wei Qianmao, Wei Alin, and Fang Qinghao families. It is estimated that 21–22 houses and more than 30,000 catties of grain were burned, with losses of more than 20,000 yuan. The old woman was rescued from the flames but had a burnt head and face and was severely burned. Her life is in great danger.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Commercial Registration to Be Extended</h3>
<p>In order to manage and control the commerce of Yu Province, the Zhejiang Construction Department began to conduct commercial registration in September. To supervise and promote the progress for nearly three months, Zhu Yeqing, the director of the Industry and Commerce Management Office, was specially dispatched to Shaoxing, Yuyao, Xinchang, Shengxian, Yin County, Zhenhai, Shangyu, Tiantai, Linhai, Huangyan, Yongjia, Ruian, Qingtian, Lishui, Jinyun, Yongkang, Jinhua, Lanxi, Longyou, Qu County, and other counties to inspect and explain. After more than 20 days, he returned to the province last night to report. It was revealed that Shaoxing, Lishui, Leqing, and Qu County had the best results and were expected to be completed on schedule. Most of the others started operating in mid-October. In the counties of Yi Ping, Pingyang, Ruian, Qingtian, etc., due to the rampant banditry, the promotion of commercial registration was extremely difficult.</p>
<h3>Planning to Establish a National Goods Company</h3>
<p>Zhang Zilian, a national goods manufacturer in Shanghai, had previously contracted with the Zhejiang Construction Department to raise 5 million yuan to build a building on the vacant land behind the National Goods Exhibition Hall in the New Market. However, due to the difficulty of obtaining funds, construction has not yet started. Zhang's father was wanted in connection with a case, and the business was virtually suspended. For the sake of prospering the market, the government has decided to take over the operation. At the same time, the Shanghai National Goods Production and Sales Association also expressed its willingness to invest in cooperation. It is reported that the first step in building a new house will cost 200,000 yuan. It is estimated that various equipment and goods will require a capital of 2 million yuan. The Construction Department plans to recruit half of the shares from merchants and the other half to be invested by the National Goods Production and Sales Association. It will send personnel to Shanghai within days to discuss all the details.</p>
<h3>Raising Funds to Aid Suiyuan Soldiers</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce, considering that the soldiers at the front in Suiyuan were fighting bravely in the snow, and in order to express the assistance of merchants and civilians, specially convened a meeting of various trade associations to decide that, firstly, service personnel from various shops would donate one day's salary, which would be notified by the association and transferred to the China Farmers Bank for collection; secondly, they would donate one day's profit. The one-day movements of various agencies, organizations, schools, and factories in Hangzhou would be separately contacted and promoted by the National Salvation Donation Association, which was jointly formed by all sectors.</p>
<h3>Bengbu: Surveying and Mapping the Changhuai Small Vessels</h3>
<p>The Changhuai Water Public Security Bureau, considering that there are many small vessels on the Huai River, some of which have been in disrepair for many years or are poorly managed, and incidents often occur on the way, should conduct on-site surveys and mapping in order to ensure the safety of passengers. The bureau has been dispatching personnel to the river for several days to survey and inspect the hull, cabin, machinery, load, and draft of each small vessel. The survey has now been completed, and restrictions have been placed on the overloading of goods on each small vessel. Violators will be punished.</p>

<h3>Li Gongpu and Six Others: Released on Bail the Night Before Last, Summoned Again Yesterday; Details of the Court Hearing</h3>
<p>Li Gongpu, Zou Taofen, Zhang Naiqi, Wang Zaoshi, Shen Junru, Sha Qianli, and female lawyer Shi Liang, all from the cultural, academic, and legal circles of this city, were suspected of inciting labor unrest. The Municipal Police Bureau ordered detectives to secretly dispatch, and met with Chinese and Western detectives from the British and French Concessions at midnight on the 22nd to arrest them all. The next morning, they were transferred to the Second and Third Branches of the Jiangsu Higher Court for preliminary hearings, and it was ruled that Li et al. would be released on bail to their respective defense lawyers and postponed until the afternoon of the 25th for a continued hearing.</p>
<p>Continued Arrests</p>
<p>By the evening of the 23rd, the Second Higher Court received a public letter from the Municipal Police Bureau stating that Li et al. were at risk of absconding. Therefore, the criminal division chief, Yu Hua, who was hearing the case, issued arrest warrants, and Shen, Wang, and Sha were successively arrested and detained in the prison. Li Gongpu was not arrested that night because he did not return home. The scheduled hearing on the afternoon of the 25th was canceled by the Second Higher Court.</p>
<p>Open Trial</p>
<p>The trial was brought forward to 2:30 PM yesterday. At the appointed time, Chinese and Western detectives escorted Shen, Wang, and Sha to the First Criminal Division of the Second Higher Court. Lawyers E Sen, Chen Zhisui, Zhang Yaozeng, Guo Wei, Li Wenjie, Li Guozhen, Cai Liucheng, Zai Baoji, Yang Tiansun, and others, who were defending Li et al. and providing bail, all came to court together. The Municipal Police Bureau sent legal advisor Zhan Jifeng to court. After the Li Shenwang three-year-old residence was reviewed, the representative of the Municipal Police Bureau arrived in court.</p>
<p>Application for Transfer</p>
<p>Finally, Prosecutor Lin argued that he should be transferred and asked the presiding judge to rule according to law. Judge Yu then announced a recess for deliberation. After a moment, he returned to his seat and the main text said,</p>
<p>Announcement of Ruling</p>
<p>The three people of Li Shenwang are not criminals discovered in the public concession and no transfer problem arises. The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau should negotiate with the Shanghai Public Concession Engineering Bureau. After Yu Ting read the main text, he clarified the common significance, roughly that the residences of the three people, Li Shenwang, were all within the scope of the extraterritorial road construction. Since the three people were not arrested in the concession, there was no so-called transfer, and the arrest warrants issued should be revoked immediately. The prison will take Li and others back to the place where they were arrested, and hand them over to detectives from the Municipal Police Bureau, and then the detectives will take Li and the other three out of the court and execute them in accordance with the ruling.</p>
<p>Try Sha Qianli</p>
<p>One person, Sha’s residence, is the area of ​​the Public Concession, and there is no dispute about jurisdiction. The representative of the Municipal Police Bureau also requested a transfer. The court stated that it still needed to be investigated, and Yu Sha Qianli was temporarily detained and waited for another trial at 2 pm tomorrow (that is, today).</p>
<p>Zou Taofen, Zhang Naiqi, and female lawyer Shi Liang were escorted by the French patrol room to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court for investigation at 5 p.m. the day before yesterday. Wu Tingqi, a judge in the criminal division, accompanied by Wang and Liao, the two judges, and Dong Qiming, the procurator, took the seat for preliminary investigation. As a result, the official issued a decree ordering the defendant Shi Liang to hand over a shop warrant. The Zhang and Zou lawyers handed over two shop warrants for release. At 2 pm yesterday, I received a notice from the Third Branch of the High School to continue the trial at 4 pm on the same day, but because Shi Liang had gone to Suzhou until 12:05 this morning, Justice Wu Tingqi, accompanied by the two Justices Wang and Liao, Prosecutor Dong, and Clerk Wang Lixiang, took the seat at the Third Criminal Tribunal, because the shops that Zhang and Zou were looking for were not well-qualified. If they looked for another guarantor, it would be inconvenient in terms of procedures because it was late at night. The court ordered an immediate detention and waited for Shi Liang to file a case before proceeding with the review.</p>

<h3>Silk Sales Surge, Prices Soar; Shanghai Silk Factories Run Out of Raw Materials; Closures Increase in Less Than a Month; Cocoon Prices Exceed Silk Prices; Surplus Cocoon Merchants Hoard</h3>
<p>After a surge in the price of Chinese silk and a sudden increase in exports, Shanghai silk factories have run out of raw materials, cocoon prices have continued to rise, and closures have increased. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Sales Surge, Prices Soar</p>
<p>The sales of Chinese silk have surged in European and American markets, leading to soaring prices. Foreign firms based in Shanghai, such as Da Chang and Lian Na, have been buying in large quantities. At the same time, domestic silk weaving factories are operating day and night to weave silk due to the bumper harvest of agricultural products and the increased purchasing power of the people, so the sales of silk to users have increased greatly. To date, the price of Chinese silk, calculated by the standard B grade, is (1) 790 yuan in Chinese currency per dan for export, and (2) 770 yuan in national currency per dan for domestic users.</p>
<p>Raw Materials Exhausted, Closures Increase</p>
<p>After the surge in domestic and foreign sales of Chinese silk, the stocks of silk factories and silk firms in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have been greatly reduced. All silk factories are starting to reel silk, and there is a tendency for demand to exceed supply. However, there is a fear of a shortage of raw materials, which is most evident in Shanghai's silk factories. Forty-eight silk factories, including the Jiyu and Hengcang factories, have successively announced closures due to exhaustion of raw materials, including about eight or nine factories such as Shaoxing Hengtai and Fuchang Yuanyuanji.</p>
<p>Cocoon Prices Soar, Exceeding Silk Prices</p>
<p>As for the stock of cocoons in Shanghai, the number is limited and is not enough to supply the needs of the factories for one month. Therefore, factories that start work after the end of the Gregorian calendar year will inevitably have no raw materials to reel and will have to stop work completely. Regarding cocoon prices, cocoon merchants are hoarding because of the scarcity of goods and are unwilling to sell, which leads to mutual price increases. The price of top-grade cocoons has risen to 185 yuan per dan. If calculated on the basis of 400 catties of cocoons being reeled, then every four dan of cocoons reels one dan of silk, and the cost is 740 yuan. Add to that 80 yuan for reeling labor and all expenses, and the cost per silk unit is 820 yuan. Therefore, if the factories buy cocoons and reel silk, they will inevitably lose money.</p>
<h3>Qin Liankui et al. Suggest Raising Funds for Gas Masks</h3>
<p>Qin Liankui, Li Aokui, Zhao Zuwei and others in the legal profession of this city, in view of the invasion of Suiyuan by the bandit troops and the special supply of a large amount of poison gas by a certain party, believe that it is necessary to raise funds for gas masks. Yesterday, they jointly suggested to the Suiyuan Bandit Suppression Relief and慰劳 Committee and sent a letter to the First Special Zone Citizens' Federation, requesting that a joint meeting of municipal mass organizations be convened to launch a mass fundraising campaign for gas masks. The original letter is recorded below: We are writing to you to inform you that the whole country is indignant at the bandits' border invasion. All circles in this city are paying tribute to the soldiers of Suiyuan who are fighting bloody battles to defend our territory and are raising funds to慰劳 or sending telegrams of support. Sincerely, because Sui province is a screen for Xiji and a belt for the whole of Mongolia, we must not allow the enemy to enter an inch and occupy it, so as to fall into destruction. Therefore, since the alarm was transmitted, the citizens of Shanghai have never been indifferent because of the geographical separation between north and south. However, this time, the bandits have launched a large-scale invasion, and the instigator behind them, in addition to fully supplying aircraft and guns, is also preparing to use a large amount of poison gas for slaughter. According to the major newspapers in this city on the 16th, the Suiyuan telegram said, "A certain party transported 17 trucks of poison gas bombs from Duolun to Zhangbei, and there are also two poison gas emitters, which may release poison gas against us." Also, the Guihua telegram said, "It is heard that the enemy has transported poison gas bombs and is preparing to release them against us." Therefore, the bandits' poison gas attack is inevitable. Purchasing and preparing gas masks and transporting them to the front is a matter of urgency. Compared to gifting gloves and other cold-weather items, it is a more urgent need. In addition to sending a letter to the慰劳 Relief Committee with suggestions, we are sending this letter to you to ask you to convene a joint meeting of municipal mass organizations as soon as possible to launch a mass fundraising campaign for gas masks, so that our soldiers who defend the country on the front line can be brave in killing bandits without any worries. This is our greatest prayer. To the First Special Zone Citizens' Federation, the wording of the letters to the Lawyers' Association and the Relief Committee is the same, omitted.</p>
<h3>Huang Bodu Scheduled to Return to Japan</h3>

<h3>Donation Meeting for Aircraft Purchase to Celebrate Birthday; Meeting of Executive Committee; Trade Union Federation Transfers Donations from Various Textile Mills to Celebrate Birthday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Donation Committee for Purchasing an Aircraft to Present to the Government and Commemorate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek’s 50th Birthday convened an executive committee meeting at 5:00 PM on the 21st. Those in attendance included Chief Executive Li Dachao and executive members Zhang Xiamin, among 11 others. Chairman Li Dachao delivered a report which briefly stated, "Aviation saves the nation, presenting an aircraft to celebrate a birthday, a one-day campaign. This was initially initiated by the Lih Pao newspaper. Mr. Yao Songnian of the hotel industry association had already discussed its implementation beforehand. Therefore, a plan was drafted and passed by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, urging its promotion. The publicity efforts of this committee, and the liaison with various organizations, schools, and industries in the city, have received enthusiastic support and generous contributions, which have also inspired similar responses in other provinces and cities, striving to promote it. The central government has also paid close attention, hence the recent instruction for unified measures. Yesterday, the municipal Party headquarters convened a meeting of various agencies and organizations, deciding to establish a committee to promote a one-day income movement. The significance of this organization lies in uniform collection, concentrating efforts, and using the collected donations for designated purposes, with the remaining funds to be remitted to the central government for national salvation. However, the original intention of this one-day movement in Shanghai was to supplement the donation for purchasing an aircraft to celebrate a birthday. I reported to the representatives at the meeting, hoping that everyone would work hard, actively assist, and liaise to ensure that the prescribed donation for presenting an aircraft to celebrate a birthday, which is not yet sufficient, is submitted as soon as possible, so that it can be concluded and announced. Furthermore, the bandits and puppet regime have invaded Suiyuan. Fortunately, our defending soldiers are working hard to resist, loyally defending the country, admired by the world. All sectors are promoting the movement to rescue and慰問 the soldiers fighting bandits in Suiyuan. This committee should do its utmost to assist, publicize, and promote, to fulfill its duty," and so on. Subsequently, each executive member reported on the progress of liaison, and various proposals for future directions were discussed.

The conference opened on September 4th this year and lasted for three weeks. The proposals submitted by China, namely (1) Seamen should be treated equally regardless of nationality or race, and (2) Abolish the deposit system and subcontracting system (both cases discussed together), were passed by the conference. The content and provisions of the case are very perfect. During the conference, the Maritime Labour Advisory Committee of the National Labour Office was formed by representatives from the 48 participating countries, and China was also elected as one of the members. This is the first time we have been elected since the establishment of the Maritime Conference. The Maritime Conference is held annually, and its expenses are borne by the International Labour Office. At the opening of this conference, given the obvious differences between the situation of Chinese seamen and international seamen, Banfu, in addition to fulfilling his mission, did his best to connect with international representatives and was encouraged by colleagues in the domestic maritime industry, resulting in good results," and so on.</p>

<h3>Labor Disputes in Japanese Textile Mills Resolved One After Another; Nongtian Two Factories to Resume Operations This Morning; Workers at Xihua Three Factories Resume Work; Japan-China Inside and Outside Cotton to be Mediated Again; Workers' Representatives in East and West Shanghai Appeal to Mr. Du</h3>
<p>According to Dagongshe, the labor strikes at Japanese textile mills in the western district of Shanghai, have been mediated. Xihua resumed operations yesterday morning, and Fengtian is scheduled to resume operations this morning. The labor dispute at the Japan-China Inside and Outside Cotton mills is still being mediated. Workers' representatives from the two districts appealed to Mr. Du yesterday, and discussions are scheduled for today. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>All Workers at Xihua Three Factories Return to Work</p>
<p>The labor strike at the Xihua First, Second, and Third Textile Mills on Robison Road has been resolved after mediation by party and government authorities and the signing of eight terms of settlement. All 2,600 workers at the factory, including 1,400 day shift workers, returned to work at 6:00 AM yesterday. The remaining 1,198 night shift workers also returned to work at 6:00 PM, and order was maintained. Gu, the patrol officer from the Robison Road Public Security Police Station in charge of the area, also sent 12 police officers to look after the factory gate. All Japanese marines stationed inside the factory also withdrew at approximately 6:00 PM last night.</p>
<p>Japan-China Two Factories' Work Stalled</p>
<p>The workers at the Japan-China Third and Fourth factories on Robison Road went on strike the afternoon before yesterday at 3:30 PM because of slight damage to machinery. The factory believed that the workers had shut down the machines and reported to the Concession police, who dispatched a large number of detectives to drive the workers out of the factory, resulting in a complete strike that has not yet been resolved. Yesterday morning, only 80 or so day shift workers entered the factory, but they left shortly after because they could not work. None of the night shift workers entered the factory, so work was completely stalled. The striking workers at the factory have resolved to present seven demands to the factory.</p>
<p>Fengtian Two Factories to Resume Operations This Morning</p>
<p>The strike at the Fengtian First and Second factories next to the Zhongshan Road Bridge has been resolved through mediation by Mr. Du Yuesheng. The factory has also completed the repair of the machinery inside the workshop and is scheduled to resume operations as usual at 6:00 AM this morning. The workers have also decided to return to work.</p>
<p>Party and Government Mediation of Inside and Outside Cotton Labor Dispute</p>
<p>According to a reporter's investigation, the situation at the Japanese Inside and Outside Cotton factories is as follows: the number of workers who have resumed work at the First and Second factories accounts for 20% of the workforce; the number of workers who have resumed work at the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth factories accounts for 30-40%. Although the number of night shift workers increased compared to the day shift yesterday evening, most are still continuing to strike and will only return to work after the factory accepts all terms. In order to prevent the dispute from dragging on, the Bureau of Social Affairs plans to send personnel again this afternoon to mediate and resolve the dispute as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Representatives from Two Districts Jointly Petition</p>
<p>More than 40 workers' representatives from the following factories in western Shanghai: Inside and Outside Cotton First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth factories; Japan-China Third and Fourth factories; Xihua First, Second, and Third factories; Tongxing First and Second factories; Fengtian Two factories; and the following factories in eastern Shanghai: Shanghai First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth factories; Donghua; Dakang; Yufeng; Gongzheng, etc., presented a joint petition to Mr. Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Local Association of this city, at 10:00 AM yesterday.

After inquiring about the situation of the strike, he agreed to mediate, promising to first find a way to release the arrested workers and to persuade the workers to maintain order and await resolution. The representatives were satisfied and then departed.</p>
<p>Petition Presents Five Demands</p>
<p>Workers' representatives from the western and eastern districts of Shanghai presented a petition to Mr. Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Local Association. The demands presented by the workers are listed below: (1) Increase wages by 10%.

(3) One hour of rest per day (9:00 AM to 9:15 AM, 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM, 3:00 PM to 3:15 PM).

(5) No beating or scolding of workers, and please negotiate for the release of arrested workers.</p>
<h3>Chongqi Land Rights Issue; Transfer of Chongming People's Land Rights in Qidong; Chongming Fellow-Provincials Vow to Fight to the Death</h3>
<p>Since the merger of Chongming and Qidong counties, the motion for separate governance launched by the Chongming people remains unresolved. Now, Qidong people have taken actions to transfer the land rights of Chongming people in Qidong, petitioning the provincial government to implement it. This matter is of great importance. If it is implemented, Chongming landowners will become displaced people. Therefore, they are all opposed to it. Chongming people in Shanghai are also gathering to discuss effective measures to deal with it. The following are the details reported by a Shanghai News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>Qidong Land Rent Situation</p>
<p>Qidong was originally an outer sandbar affiliated to Chongming. In 1928, the provincial government accepted the request of the Qidong people and established the county, which is now known as Qidong. There are a total of 900,000 mu of cultivated land in Qidong. Due to historical reasons, most of the land rights are owned by Chongming landowners, accounting for about 60%. They are cultivated by local tenant farmers. The annual land rent is 3 yuan per mu for upper-grade land, 2.5 yuan for middle-grade land, and slightly less than 1 yuan for lower-grade land. The collection of rent by Chongming people in Qidong has been customary. However, since the establishment of Qidong County, the Qidong County government has levied heavy land taxes. And due to the lack of unified governance, local farmers often riot. In fact, Chongming landowners have suffered from the division of the county. Elders in the county, such as Wang Qingmu, have repeatedly appealed to the Executive Yuan for separate governance, but the issue remains unresolved.</p>
<p>Launch of Land Revolution</p>
<p>Zhou Ruqian, a member of the Standing Committee of the County Party Department of the County, in order to resolve the Chongqi dispute, petitioned the provincial government to transfer the land rights of the Chongming people in Qidong. The provincial government considered this matter to be of great importance and ordered the Fourth District Administrative Inspector's Office to convene representatives from the two county governments, the county party departments, and relevant agencies to discuss the matter in detail. The Office convened a meeting on the 10th of this month, but it did not produce any results due to strong opposition from the Chongming people.</p>
<p>Simplified Rules for Transferring Land Rights</p>
<p>The Qidong County Party Department and the County Government will jointly appoint local impartial people to organize a committee to transfer the land rights of the Chongming people in Qidong, specializing in planning all transfer matters, starting with an investigation of the Chongming people's land rights, land quality divided into upper-grade, middle-grade, and lower-grade land, etc. Land rights will be transferred by giving land price bonds according to the grades, paying interest and collecting the land price. The Qidong Land Rights Transfer Committee will be responsible for collecting the Qidong farmland rent owned by the Chongming people. The rent collected will be used to pay land taxes and land price bond interest, and the remainder will be used as a land price bond principal repayment fund. The repayment order will be determined by lottery. The land price bond interest will be 6% per year. Upper-grade land will be given land price bonds of 8 yuan per mu, middle-grade land 7.5 yuan, and lower-grade land 6 yuan, which will be repaid in six years.</p>
<p>Fellow-Provincials in Shanghai Oppose</p>
<p>Since this incident occurred, it has sparked strong opposition from the Chongming people, who believe that if it is implemented, Chongming landowners will become displaced people. Fellow-provincials in Shanghai, such as Tong Xingbai, have also held meetings to discuss the steps to be taken, urging the provincial government to handle the matter with caution. Chen Dongbai, Yang Zhenzhong, Shi Yunpeng, Tong Muge, Lu Yinchu, Xu Peihang, and Zhu Yakui from the Shanghai Chongming Alumni Association also believe that this move lacks theoretical basis and have resolved to firmly oppose it. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency also inquired about this matter from scholars familiar with the land system, who said that according to Premier Sun's "Land to the Tiller" doctrine, landowners should voluntarily report land prices. The land price set by the county is not reported by the landowners themselves, so implementation may be difficult.</p>
<h3>Kondo, Commander of Japanese Marines, Visited Wu and Yang Yesterday to Bid Farewell</h3>
<p>Kondo, Commander of the Japanese Naval Special Marines stationed in Shanghai, is being recalled to his country and will depart soon. He visited the Songhu Garrison Headquarters at 9:50 AM yesterday, accompanied by his Chief of Staff, Sugiyama, to bid farewell to Commander Yang. Mr. Yang, accompanied by Zhou Jue, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai, and Secretary Sun Lyping, received them. A company of honor guards was sent. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, they departed. Subsequently, at 11:45 AM, they went to the Municipal Government to bid farewell to Mayor Wu. The Mayor, accompanied by Commissioner Wang Changchun, received them, and honor guards were also sent to welcome and escort them in accordance with the ceremony. After a brief and pleasant conversation, they left. Rear Admiral Kondo, Commander of the Japanese Marines stationed in Shanghai, also visited the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel Osugi and other staff members, to bid farewell. An honorary guard of the Russian unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps was organized, and the ceremony was extremely grand.</p>
<h3>Li Gan Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Li Gan, a member of the Tariff Commission of the Ministry of Finance, (Zi Qijun) accompanied Hu Shi and others to attend the Pacific International Academic Conference in California, USA, in July of this year.

It is reported that he was very impressed with his investigation of the various countries.</p>

<h3>Public Works Department: Relocation of Bund Flagpole</h3>
<p>A flagpole of the Public Works Department on the Bund, originally established by the British Shipping Company, was gifted to the Public Works Department in 1912. Due to revisions in traffic regulations and the establishment of a new parking area on the Bund, the flagpole's location was obstructing traffic. With the consent of the British Shipping Company, it has been transferred as a gift to the Shanghai Race Club to commemorate the founders of the Race Club's foundation. It is said that the flagpole will soon be moved to the Racecourse.</p>
<h3>Zhou Lihua: Art Exhibition Closes Today</h3>
<p>Ms. Zhou Lihua's exhibition reaches its tenth day today and will close at 7:00 PM. Despite numerous requests from various circles for an extension, Ms. Zhou has accepted an invitation from friends in Beijing to hold an exhibition there at the beginning of next month. As the time is short and preparations are time-consuming, and before going to Beijing, she must also send a large portion of her works to the Zhonghua Book Company for typesetting and publishing as a collection, it is practically impossible to extend the exhibition further. Therefore, the number of visitors today is especially large.</p>
<h3>Japanese Sailor Case on Haining Road: Appeal Hearing Today</h3>
<p>In the case of the murder of Japanese sailor Tian Gang Chaoguang on Haining Road, Hongkou, near Lane 15, Zhang Ronghe, a porridge vendor from Changzhou, was arrested as a suspect and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Judge Zhong Qing conducted several trials and ruled that Zhang was not the murderer and should be declared innocent. This was previously reported in detail by this newspaper. However, the Public Works Department's police department expressed dissatisfaction and filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court. It is now learned that the Second Branch of the High Court has approved the case and will hold a hearing today.</p>

<h3>Lawsuit over Dog: Each Holds Their Ground; Referred to Bureau for Adjudication</h3>
<p>Dong Zhiying, a resident of Jiguili No. 2, Yanhai Road, Laobeimen, from Wuxian, aged twenty-two or twenty-three, owns a hunting dog. At 8:30 PM last night, the dog ran into the home of Pan Zhu, a local woman, at No. 192 on the same road, startling her child and causing the child to fall. Mrs. Pan Zhu, angered, managed to confine the dog in a room and beat it. Dong Zhiying arrived to argue, stating that it was a livestock and did not understand human affairs, and should not be beaten, and that if it was injured, she should be held responsible. Mrs. Pan Zhu argued that his dog should not be allowed to run into other people's homes and frighten children, and that he should also be held responsible. A fierce argument ensued. Police Chief Ha Xiaozhong and Constable Li Qihan arrived to mediate, but Dong became difficult with the police and was taken to the Laobeimen Police Station for investigation. Officer Hu tried to persuade and mediate with Dong Zhiying, but Dong felt that he was biased and insisted on requesting that the case be referred to the court. As mediation was ineffective, he was referred to the bureau for adjudication.</p>

<h3>Disputes Arise from Purchase of Real Estate; Lawsuit Filed for Joint Fraud; After Purchasing Land and Building a House, Someone Suddenly Claims Property Rights; Song Wenkui Sues Li Dixian, Lu Daocui, et al.</h3>
<p>Local resident Song Wenkui, represented by lawyer Yan Zuodeshou, filed a lawsuit in the Local Court against Li Dixian of No. 361, East Town, Fahua, and Lu Daocui, resident of Meijialong Lane 11, No. 1, City, for joint fraud. The lawsuit stated that in December 1934, the plaintiff purchased 4 mu and 2 fen and 0.01 hao of land at No. 6-113, Liangziping, Yangjing District, from the first defendant. The second defendant signed a guarantee. The plaintiff paid the full purchase price of 1,200 yuan and took over management. After building a house on the land, there were no disputes for more than a year. Unexpectedly, Lu Zhiqing, acting as a representative of the Lu Clan Ancestral Property Management Committee, came forward to claim that the above-mentioned property was the Lu Clan ancestral property. At the same time, he filed a lawsuit to determine property rights, suing the first and second defendants and the plaintiff together. After two trials, the result was that the purchase agreement between the plaintiff and the first defendant was invalid, and the first and second defendants and the plaintiff were jointly liable to return the funds. It is alleged that the first defendant colluded to sell the land to the plaintiff and defraud a large sum of money. This can be seen from the list of ancestral properties listed in the indictment of the second defendant and his brother Lu Shufan in the property division case in the Civil Court of the court, which did not include the above-mentioned property. Moreover, when the property was divided, the first defendant appeared in court to testify, proving that the first and second defendants knew that the above-mentioned property did not belong to them, but still resold it, one claiming to be the owner and the other signing a guarantee, in order to achieve the purpose of defrauding a large sum of money. It is requested that they be punished under Article 339 of the Criminal Law, etc. Judge Liu opened the trial yesterday. Only Li Dixian, the first defendant, was present. The official ordered that the hearing be adjourned to gather evidence.</p>
<h3>Student at Literacy School Shot by Classmate</h3>
<p>Tang Guoren, a native of Anhui, aged twenty-one, was a weaver at the Shanghai Tongyu Cotton Mill at No. 31, Zhongxingshi Village, Kongjiang Road, Yinxiang Township. He was studying at a literacy school nearby in the evening. At around 7:00 PM last night, while Tang Guoren was studying at the school, a classmate, A (said to be a local thug), lured him out of the school and immediately pulled out a pistol and fired at him. The bullet hit Tang's mouth and did not pass through. Tang fell to the ground injured and lost consciousness. Constable No. 2905 nearby heard the sound and rushed to the scene, but the perpetrator had already fled without a trace. He had no choice but to accompany Tang to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the injury is extremely serious and his life is in danger.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Requests Ban on Export of Rags: Preserve a Portion of Raw Materials; Increase Production by a Fraction</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday informed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, requesting a strict ban on the export of rags. The original telegram stated: "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry, Nanjing: On the 23rd of this month, we received a letter from Minfeng Die Paper Co., Ltd., stating that the key to industrial development lies entirely in raw materials. All industrially advanced countries in the world regard raw materials as the lifeblood of industry. Our country has always adopted a laissez-faire attitude, resulting in the burying and abandonment of many excellent products. Foreigners take the opportunity to exploit this, exporting large quantities, while domestic national goods factories feel that the supply is insufficient. This is the main reason why our country's industry cannot thrive. Taking the paper industry as an example, its main raw material is wood pulp. As there is no domestic wood pulp production, relying on foreign wood pulp not only subjects us to foreign control and increases costs, but also undermines the status of purely national goods. Therefore, many domestic paper mills use hemp, reeds, etc. to compensate. In addition, rags, whether cotton or hemp, are rich in fibers and of pure quality. Their need is urgent. These rags are originally waste products and are available everywhere. Once collected, the quantity is considerable. Currently, domestic paper mills have all learned to use them. However, foreign merchants are even more actively collecting and hoarding them, penetrating deep into the interior without restrictions. Our national goods factories are less powerful, resulting in the host being supplanted by the guest. They cannot compete with them and must watch as domestic raw materials are plundered and their own needs have to rely on imports, causing profits to flow abroad. Considering the international principles of commodity circulation, the export of raw materials should be based on comparative advantage. The needs of the country should be assessed and appropriate adjustments made. At a time when the domestic machine-made paper industry is in its infancy, given the heavy use of paper and the huge losses over the years, its development prospects are truly unlimited. The convenience and abundance of raw material supply should be planned early. This type of rag is a readily available raw material, and the use of waste materials is in line with economic principles. Now that domestic demand is urgent, it cannot be allowed to flow out. Our company is engaged in the paper industry and feels the need for these rags more acutely. Therefore, we request that your association review the situation and submit it to the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry, requesting immediate approval to order the customs to ban the export of rags or increase the export tax rate to show restrictions and maintain the industry, etc. Accordingly, considering that our country's machine-made paper industry is still in its infancy and that rags are the main raw material needed, as cotton and hemp rags are rich in fibers and suitable for papermaking, the domestic need for these rags is very urgent. The association has repeatedly received requests from foreign merchants to introduce products for export, but we have refused due to insufficient supply. To preserve a portion of raw materials is to increase paper production by a fraction. The factory's proposal to ban exports or increase export tax rates is indeed to maintain operations and prevent losses. We respectfully request your review and approval to maintain the paper industry. In addition to sending a separate telegram, we request your compliance. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>Paramount Films Still Not Allowed to Be Shown</h3>
<p>According to the foreign news agency in Shanghai, the Central Film Censorship Committee has ordered Paramount to correct the film "The General Died at Dawn" because it contains elements that insult China. As of now, a satisfactory solution has not been reached. Yesterday afternoon, the company's manager in Shanghai agreed to send the film to Nanjing for re-examination within forty days. However, the Censorship Committee believes that its response is not satisfactory and will refuse to issue the company's film screening licenses.</p>
<h3>Misunderstanding Between Father-in-Law and Son-in-Law: Reconciliation of Indecent Assault Case; Cohabitation Before Marriage with Parental Consent; Hu Zhuoxing Found Not Guilty After Explanation and Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Xi Fengkui, a native of Dongting Mountain residing at No. 72 Lafayette Road in the French Concession, was previously a senior clerk at Kongshi Foreign Firm and is now unemployed. His daughter, Ye Xian, aged nineteen, was betrothed to Hu Zhuoxing (formerly known as Hu Xiang), a young man from Hangzhou, with Xi's consent. Before the engagement ceremony, they cohabited and had a physical relationship, resulting in a pregnancy that ended in miscarriage. Hu sent her to the hospital for treatment and stayed there. Xi, due to disagreements with Hu, instructed his son, Jia Zheng (aged eighteen, an apprentice at the Senlin Industrial Company), to report to the French police that Hu had indecently assaulted his daughter and disrupted the family. The police department filed a public prosecution with the First Special Court according to law. Judge Wang Gangxu repeatedly opened the trial for investigation. According to the testimony of Hu and Xi Ye Xian, the marriage was arranged by their parents and they cohabited before the engagement ceremony. They have now explained and reconciled the misunderstanding. Xi made a statement agreeing to hold the engagement ceremony in one week. After verifying the statements, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled a date for the pronouncement of the verdict. This was previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Chief Judge Shan Yi came to the First Criminal Court to pronounce the verdict. The defendant was not present. The court ruled Hu Zhuoxing not guilty. During the appeal period, the defendant remains under the custody of the original guarantor.</p>
<h3>Truth About Yang Ming's Invention of Synthetic Kerosene; Social Bureau Has Refuted It</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, a man named Yang Ming in Shanghai previously claimed to have invented synthetic kerosene, using cooked iron, boiled water, and tea leaves as the main ingredients. He submitted a description and samples to the Municipal Social Bureau for verification and patent application. The bureau immediately sent it to the Industrial Testing Institute for investigation and chemical testing. According to the Institute's reply, after chemically testing the small bottle of samples, the sample was divided into two layers of different liquids. The upper layer was an oily liquid, which was the original oil added, as well as camphor, phosphorus, sulfur, and other substances dissolved in the liquid, which could burn when ignited. The lower layer was an aqueous solution, containing iron, phosphorus, sulfate, and other organic substances, which did not burn when ignited. This was due to the chemical changes caused by mixing cooked iron, boiled water, and tea leaves, resulting in a small amount of iron reacting with the gallic acid in the tea leaves to form a black substance. The majority of the iron was gasified into rust. Over time, with prolonged placement, only dry water, rotten tea, and iron rust would be seen, and it would never be transformed into a combustible oily substance. Even with the addition of silk, thin bamboo, and sulfuric acid, sulfuric acid can only decompose the above-mentioned animal and plant fibers into black liquid and dissolve gasified iron into ferrous sulfate. The addition of ammonia can only neutralize the acidity of sulfuric acid and cannot transform the above-mentioned solution into a combustible oily substance. The inventor claimed that the above-mentioned mixed liquid was "non-flammable kerosene" and needed to be mixed with original oil, camphor, and other substances to burn. This is because oil and water do not mix, and the oil is lighter than the liquid, so the oil floats on the liquid surface and can still burn like kerosene, which has nothing to do with cooked iron, boiled water, and tea leaves. Anyone with a little scientific knowledge should know this. It is said that the inventor Yang Ming only graduated from primary school, and he claims that he purchased all the textbooks in middle school and studied them himself for five years, and also studied Taoist science and body science for nine years. When asked what a chemical change is, he answered with refining qi and alchemy. When asked what a physical change is, he answered with the five elements and transformation. He is already lost in ignorance and deeply entrenched in the wrong path, with a smattering of knowledge and a lot of nonsense. A person who does not know chemistry or physics actually has the whimsical idea of adding original oil impurities to the aqueous liquid and calling it synthetic kerosene. This is no different from coating a magnetic plate with gold glaze and calling it a synthetic gold nugget. How can there be such a reason, etc. The bureau immediately refuted it. Recently, he also transmitted the invention of refining white sugar from flour and red brick, organized the China Ming Research Institute, and applied to the Social Bureau for promotion and sponsorship. It is heard that the Social Bureau immediately refuted it and ordered the China Invention Research Institute to be canceled to prevent those who do not understand the truth from being deceived.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Industry Orders Adoption of Dongya Lithopone</h3>
<p>The Dongya Pigment Factory previously applied to the Ministry of Industry for promotion of domestically produced lithopone, as reported in the newspaper on the 9th. It is now learned that the factory has received a directive from the Ministry of Industry stating: "Noted. We have issued a notice to the provincial and municipal departments and bureaus to instruct the paint industry to comply with the adoption. You are hereby informed." It is said that due to the factory's excellent products and low prices, Chinese people are abandoning imported lithopone and purchasing the factory's products.

<h3>Tianci Steamer Driver Accused of Negligence: Capsized Civilian Boat, Drowning Two People</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the "day of this month, at 2:00 PM, the Tianci steamer was docked at Pier No. 10 in Nanshi. After the ship had stopped, Jiang Jincai, the engineer in charge of the ship, followed the usual procedure of cranking the engine, causing the rudder to move greatly, creating a wave that capsized Yang Wang's civilian boat. All the people on the boat fell into the water. After being salvaged, the woman's son, Husheng, daughter, Laohu, and the woman's family of three were rescued. However, the woman's daughter, Meimei, who was just over a month old, and a relative, Nv Gan Sudi, both drowned. After investigation, the Water Patrol found that Jiang Jincai had indeed neglected the necessary attention to his duties, resulting in the injury of two people.

<h3>Apprentice Steals Money and Then Falsely Claims to Have Taken Poison</h3>
<p>At Songmao Candle Shop No. 170, Wanyu Pier, Nanshi, yesterday, a friend deposited more than 500 yuan in cash, which was placed in the drawer of the shop's account table. At that time, the drawer was forgotten to be locked. Today, at about 3:00 PM, it was discovered that the cash had been stolen. After investigation by the shop owner, Luo Yonghua, a sixteen-year-old Ningbo apprentice in the shop, was found to be suspicious. A search of his bed revealed the stolen cash hidden in his pillow. The shop owner reprimanded him severely. The apprentice, in desperation, ran away, but returned shortly after, muttering to himself, "I have taken opium." He then secretly lay down in the candle box. The shop owner, fearing that he had indeed taken poison, quickly sent him to the hospital for treatment. However, after diagnosis by the doctor, he had not taken poison and was only trying to deceive and scare people.</p>

<h3>National Rice Transportation and Exchange: Banks Handle Independently; Joint Appropriation Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>The Bank of Communications and other banks had planned to allocate 10 million yuan to handle national rice exchange, starting with the transportation of Hunan rice to Guangdong. All the current processes were drafted by the Bank of Communications. Yesterday, a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from banking circles that the Bank of Communications and other banks, in view of the handling of national rice exchange, all banks handle it independently as soon as possible. Regarding the exchange for the transportation of Hunan rice to Guangdong, the Bank of Communications and other banks have all handled it as much as possible. Because exchange is the safest form of lending, there is no urgent need to jointly allocate funds. Therefore, the matter of allocating 10 million yuan to handle national rice exchange has been temporarily suspended.</p>

<h3>Ye Qinghua's Wife Accuses Concubine of Assault; Trial Concludes; Sentence Scheduled for the 30th</h3>
<p>Ye Qinghua, a native of Xiamen, was recently sued in the Special Second Court by a woman from his hometown, Wu Yu, through a lawyer, for crimes of fraudulent marriage, rape, undermining public morals, and abandonment. The court, based on the indictment, issued a summons on the 13th of last month, ordering Wu to accompany the bailiffs to arrest the defendant, but they returned without finding him. That afternoon, Ye's wife, Yang Zhuxia, and her friend, Chen Rong, learned that Wu was at the Dacheng Apartment on Pubei Road and rushed there to beat Wu. The two fought in the middle of the road and were taken to the police station by the patrolmen for punishment. Wu Yu was injured and went to the hospital for treatment. She also filed a lawsuit with the Special Second Court to examine her injuries and accused Ye Qinghua, Yang Zhuxia, and Chen Rong of assault, requesting investigation. The trial judge Sun Pengxian of the Special Second Court summoned both parties on the afternoon of the 23rd, and the two cases were combined for trial. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Ye's wife, Yang Zhuxia, also hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, accusing Wu Yu of assault. She claimed that Wu, on the 13th, gathered women to come and commit violence and insult. She requested investigation. The court, based on the indictment, has held several hearings. Because the defendant Wu Yu was still in the hospital and had not recovered, she could not appear in court. Her lawyer represented her and requested postponement. Yesterday morning, trial judge Zhu Chuzhe presided over the trial in the Criminal Division. Both parties and their lawyers appeared in court. According to the plaintiff's statement, the defendant called people to commit violence. The defendant Wu Yu stated that on that day, she went with the bailiffs to arrest the defendant. When they arrived at the plaintiff's residence, they did not find Ye Qinghua. After returning, the bailiffs went alone to deliver the summons. In the afternoon, Ye Qinghua, accompanied by the plaintiff and Chen Rong, rushed to the Dacheng Apartment to beat her. Many people saw her being injured and she has already filed a lawsuit. She did not call anyone to beat the plaintiff and requested investigation. The court verified the statements and ordered the lawyers of both parties to debate, then announced the conclusion of the trial, scheduling the sentencing for the morning of the 30th.</p>
<h3>Peddlers Going to Europe: Guarantee by Chamber of Commerce Required for Permits; Otherwise, All Will Be Rejected</h3>
<p>According to the "Shenshi News," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that in recent years, a large number of ignorant people have gone to Europe to make a living, and the goods they sell are mostly crude and inferior, which has been criticized by foreign newspapers and has tarnished the country's reputation. Therefore, it has issued a notice to all provincial and municipal governments to take measures to stop this. In the future, all permit-issuing authorities must refuse to issue passports to such peddlers unless they have a formal written guarantee from the Chamber of Commerce. Special attention should be paid to those from Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province. The original notice stated that in recent years, a large number of peddlers from Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province, have gone to Europe to make a living. These peddlers are all ignorant people who do not speak the language, are poorly dressed, and often violate foreign laws when they arrive in foreign countries, suffering detention. This has been criticized by foreign newspapers, and the goods they sell are mostly crude and inferior, which are not welcomed by foreigners. It is already difficult for them to make a living. Recently, due to the European economic panic, even if the Qingtian peddlers wear worn clothes and eat coarse food, live in humble houses, and lead an inhuman life, they still cannot maintain themselves and are drifting in foreign countries, almost like beggars with no fixed livelihood. This has tarnished the country's reputation. In view of this, the Ministry has repeatedly issued notices to all provincial and municipal governments and permit-issuing authorities to stop issuing passports to peddlers going abroad. According to reports from various places, unscrupulous people often lure ignorant villagers to go abroad to make a living and set up agencies under names such as travel agencies to handle passport procedures, taking advantage of this to profit from them. As a result, peddlers from Zhejiang have continued to go to Europe from China. This proves that the permit-issuing authorities have failed to strictly implement the Ministry's repeated instructions. Therefore, we reiterate the previous order: All merchants applying for passports to go abroad must be refused passports if they do not have a reliable guarantee from the Chamber of Commerce or a group, or if they have insufficient capital, lack of knowledge, or do not know a foreign language. In the future, peddlers applying for passports to go abroad must be required to take photos in person, verify the photos, and inquire about their accents. If they are found to be from Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province, they should be strictly suppressed and not be allowed to pass the permit application. Those who lure villagers to go abroad or handle procedures for such people should be monitored at all times and severely punished as a warning to others. In addition to separate notices, this notice is issued for investigation and transfer to your subordinates for strict compliance.</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaoshu Case: Released on Bail for Out-of-Court Settlement</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaoshu, the eldest son of Wang Bin-yan, a prominent figure in Zhabei and a member of the Homeland Defense Committee, was accused of seducing and abducting Zhou, the wife of Wu Zhenjue, a native of Changshu, from No. 144-330, Shan Zhong Road in the French Concession two years ago.

<h3>Sports News: A Record of the Second Performance by Tennis Stars</h3>
<p>Yesterday Morning Arrived in Shanghai, Performed in the Afternoon, and Returned to America This Morning</p>
<p>Plans for a Second Eastern Tour Next Year May Be Difficult to Realize</p>
<p>Two world tennis giants arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from the Philippines. In the afternoon, they continued their second performance at the Notre Dame Road court. The weather was clear, and the audience was more enthusiastic than the first performance. The five-yuan, three-yuan, and two-yuan seats were mostly sold out, with a total of about four thousand people. Many people also "watched the fire from across the river" from the windows and balconies of the surrounding foreign houses. The two performed well, thanks to the favorable location and weather, and were able to show their unique skills. This was incomparable to the first match, which was played in the rain. Unfortunately, the court was relatively loose, with a lot of yellow sand on it, making it very slippery when running. Every time they charged, they had to use ice-skating-style steps. The performance was divided into three sections, but in reality, people only watched the performance of Tilden and Vines. The last two singles and doubles matches could only be considered as entertainment. Tilden lost again with a score of 1-3, which was inevitable. The current "Old Tie" is only an extra for Vines, but without this old man's performance, his appeal would not be strong enough. The two played a total of four sets, thirty-three games, lasting one hour and twenty minutes.</p>
<p>Sensational Performance</p>
<p>Tilden started serving, and both sides casually responded. Tilden won the first game with a score of 6-4. Vines had two light balls that barely crossed the net, and Tilden couldn't return them, so he returned a game. In the next game, both sides had beautiful volleys, shooting left and right. Vines twice returned Tilden's serve, which was extremely fast, and after several back-and-forth volleys, he suddenly played a light ball, causing the ball to land near the net, which won the audience's cheers. Old Tie lost three games in a row. In the fifth game, Vines frequently sent the ball into the net, so Tilden added a game. Vines began to use "cannonball-style" serves. Old Tie occasionally returned one, but it was hit by Vines in a critical area. After the score was 4-2, neither side was willing to relax, and after seven ties, Vines finally won. Vines also won the last game with a slide return, making the score 6-2.</p>
<p>Old Tie Wins</p>
<p>The game still started with Tilden serving and winning, but he lost to Vines' light ball, making the score 1-1. Among them, Vines once had a double fault on a serve. After Vines obtained Tilden's serve, Vines had three net serves in the next game, and the fourth time it was successful, making it impossible for Old Tie to return the ball. However, the result of the game was a victory for Tilden, making the score 2-2. Then it became 3-2, with Tilden taking the lead. In the next game, Vines had the first opportunity to use a smash. The ball came from Tilden's high ball returned from the baseline. Vines quickly retreated, jumped up, and smashed it, with an incomparably beautiful posture, but unfortunately, it hit the end of the racket and fell into the net. After Vines tied the score (3-3), Old Tie won consecutively, with Tilden winning the first set with a score of 6-3. In the seventh game, Vines saved a ball on the baseline. The ball was very high, and with an extremely fast movement, he turned around and smashed it, and the ball was shot into the opponent's area like a cannonball, which was extremely fast. Although Old Tie was waiting on the baseline, he was unable to return the save, which won the audience's applause and cheers like thunder.</p>
<p>Each Displays Their Special Skills</p>
<p>The third set started with Vines serving. Old Tie failed to return two extremely fast serves. Vines repeatedly used light balls. Both sides displayed their special skills. Old Tie also used his best skills to fight back. Vines began to go to the net again and was able to handle it with ease, winning three games in a row. In the fourth game, the two fought tirelessly, tying again and again, and it was difficult to tell who was better. Finally, the teenager won with a score of 10-8. The next two games belonged to Old Tie. Vines occasionally committed the fault of touching the net. After each won another game, Vines ended the set with a serve, making the score 6-3. In the fourth set, Old Tie was exhausted from running, and his old age was fully revealed. Vines controlled the overall situation, only losing the third game, and won again with a score of 6-1.</p>
<p>An After-Party Game</p>
<p>After the competition, Vines immediately played a singles match against Tao Maojian, the Shanghai Magge champion. Tao's skills were quite skilled, but the difference in strength was too great, and there was not much competition. Tao obtained the fourth game. After that, Vines touched the net several times after the score was 5-1, and Tao won another game, resulting in a score of 6-2. Then, a doubles performance was held. Tilden and Vines teamed up, and their opponents were Dai Mingfa and Wang Miaosong. Tilden and Vines performed humorously, and Dai and Wang were exhausted from running. Sometimes there were also many good plays, which were praised by the audience. The results were 6-0 and 6-1.</p>
<p>Leaving Shanghai to Return Home</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, Tilden and the others went straight to the Huizhong Hotel to rest. At 11:00 a.m., Tilden went to the Putuo Trading Company to discuss the matter of Vines and Pan Lai coming to China to perform next spring. According to the company, all the conditions have been negotiated and the contract can be signed. However, according to another rumor, Vines and the others said that because there were not many Chinese spectators, they would have to perform in major cities across the country if they wanted to come to China, so the procedures were more complicated, and everything would have to be further discussed by letter and telegram before a decision could be made. According to another source, the plan for Vines and Pan Lai to come to China again has been cancelled. Canafan Lolo hosted a banquet at Xinghualou last night for Tilden, Vines, and Magge, who performed on stage. Qian and the others boarded the original ship and returned to the United States that night.

<p>Commercial News Shortage of Delivery Chips in Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Remain Firm This Month</p>
<p>—Soaring by 15.1 Yuan Compared to Last Month—</p>
<p>This month is the final act for the cotton yarn market. Market conditions are firm due to a shortage of deliveries and a tight supply of raw yarn. It is said that only over 1,000 bales of new yarn have been delivered, and all have been fully accepted. However, distant months have slightly weakened due to high peaks in Osaka's Sanpin yarn, and market sentiment is slightly tired. Long positions are not advised, and there may be a possibility of a slight drop of a few yuan. However, the closing price of cotton yarn this month is very high, at 246.1 yuan, which is 15.1 yuan higher than last month.</p>
<p>Falling Prices of Long-Term Marked Yarn</p>
<p>Marked yarn prices opened in the morning, with this month being the last day of trading. Short positions delivered thinly, and market sentiment was very firm. Market prices rose steadily, and long-term positions entered a favorable situation. After the second session, it was heard that although Osaka's Sanpin yarn rose this month, long-term positions fell at the same time. At the same time, raw yarn was stagnant due to a shortage of goods, and securities long positions took profits and closed out. Market prices fell back. As a result, this month's closing price was 1.5 yuan higher than the previous day's, and long-term positions fell by 1.28 yuan. In the afternoon, prices opened with this month's market conditions remaining firm due to a weak delivery of chips. However, the market sentiment was weaker and tired due to the closing out of long positions. At the same time, raw yarn transactions became sluggish, and by the time of the third closing, conditions were still ordinary. As a result, this month's prices rose by another 0.1 yuan compared to the morning closing price, and long-term positions fell by 3.467 yuan. The sales volume was 1,350 bales of Jifeng, 1,750 bales of Tongfu, 1,150 bales of Hengyi, 1,150 bales of Yiji, 1,150 bales of Jinchang, 1,2</p>

<p>A Few Words to Home Visitors from the Shēn Bào National Products Special Issue Píng Fū This time, the Shanghai National Products Movement Federation recruited five home visitors, a move that is truly admirable; and the women who took the exam are even more admirable, because in today's China, no matter what it is, people will not give it a good impression until they have officially received its benefits. This is not without reason. In recent years, there have been frequent cases of deception in society, and people have become afraid of being deceived, so they are suspicious of everything. Therefore, home visitors will inevitably be hit hard when they are actually working. However, they can not avoid difficulties, serve the country, and serve the families, embracing courage to take on this difficult task. How can this not be admirable! Of course, it is difficult to do something for the first time, but it also depends on the person. If you can deal with people and things with ease, you can proceed smoothly. I would like to offer a few points that I have thought of to home visitors: Running into walls, as mentioned above, is inevitable. Because human nature is different, it is difficult to speculate. For example, a few days ago, a partner of a business in my area lost a large batch of goods. When the news reached the ears of a reporter, he rushed to interview, intending to investigate the truth. However, the owner was arrogant and did not give a proper answer to the questions, resulting in a quick return. People like this are not uncommon in society. Originally, it is inevitable to run into walls when a person who has nothing to do with you comes to your home. However, home visitors must not be discouraged because of this. If they are discouraged, it will not only hinder the development of things, but also have a great impact on future generations. As the saying goes, "Failure is the mother of success." This is quite appropriate. I would like to offer this to home visitors with the utmost sincerity. Impression is also a very important thing. If the housewife has a bad impression of herself, no matter how appropriate and practical the argument is, it is difficult to gain the trust of the housewife. This is just like a pair of modern couples, one wearing a suit and leather shoes, and the other with a perm and high heels, going deep into the countryside to promote national salvation. As a result, not only will they not receive the expected effect, but they will inevitably be met with resentment from the villagers. Therefore, home visitors must pay attention to this point. For example, simple clothing, solemn behavior, and sincere words are all very important conditions. In addition, eloquence is also a very important thing. For example, stuttering can easily make people annoying, and speaking too fast can make people unable to hear clearly. All these will not achieve the desired effect. Clear pronunciation is certainly very important, but it is also necessary to be calm and cautious, and every word must be delivered to the other person's ears. At the same time, the lost items that are being talked about must also be interesting, so that the other person will want to listen to the next sentence after hearing one sentence. This can achieve the real effect. In addition, credibility is even more important, because if the words do not match the actions, it will never be possible to gain the trust of the housewife. At the same time, it will also have a great impact on the future of national products. Therefore, home visitors must pay attention to this point! The above points are what I thought of at any time. I wrote them down and offered them to home visitors, hoping that they will be adopted! Thoughts on the Establishment of the Women's National Products Association Yǐng Dāi Recently, we learned that the women's community in Shanghai has established a Women's National Products Association, which is of course welcome news. It goes without saying that the female compatriots who have joined this National Products Association are determined to buy national products for all the things they need, whether personally or in their families, from now on. Is that right? Now, in the city of Shanghai, there are some knowledgeable women who know that the women's community always loves to use foreign goods, and China's money is flowing to foreign countries without limit. The future is very terrible. Therefore, they initiated the organization of a Women's National Products Association, and this organization that promotes national products was established on the 11th of this month. There are currently two to three hundred members who have joined. Of course, each of them is determined to buy only national products for all the items they need from now on, and they will no longer buy any foreign goods. There have been many organizations promoting national products and using national products in the city of Shanghai in recent years. However, this time, with the establishment of the Women's National Products Association, we feel particularly fortunate for the future of the national products community. The only reason is that women are the central figures in the family, and the right to buy everything they need is mostly in the hands of women. If a housewife completely adopts national products for the things she buys herself, and on the other hand, will never let her husband or children buy foreign goods; therefore, if the implementation of using national products is led by the housewife in each family, it will be much more effective. However, if we think that there are only two to three hundred female compatriots who have joined the Women's National Products Association this time, which is still a minority among the women's community in Shanghai, then the members who have already joined must not only use national products themselves, but also work hard to solicit members and persuade other women to use national products together, so that they can achieve a more practical and great effect. Therefore, the mission that each member is responsible for is not small, is it? Sincere Words: A Review of What National Products Factories Should Have Yǎng Ān National products are now generally welcomed and popular everywhere, achieving a position of universal support. However, the national products industry itself must first conduct a thorough review. What should it review? First, it should review whether all the products have improved compared to before. If there is no improvement, what is the reason? Second, it should review whether there is room for improvement in the technology of the industries it runs. Has it paid attention to the recruitment and training of technical talents? Third, it should review whether the raw materials used are domestic. If there are no domestic raw materials, has it made preparations? If it is using foreign raw materials, how should it be remedied in the future? Fourth, it should review whether all the products have achieved the goal of standardization. Can each product meet the user's intentions? When customers place orders, can it meet their needs? Fifth, it should review whether all the products can be delivered on time and whether the delivered goods are consistent with the samples. Can it get the approval of all parties? Sixth, it should review whether the prices of all products can be reduced compared to others. When supply cannot meet demand, does it have the bad habit of raising prices, thereby discouraging the confidence of those who love national products? Seventh, it should review whether all the products have the trick of "hanging a sheep's head and selling dog meat" in order to sacrifice the life of the country's future. National product industrialists should carefully review this, correct it if they have it, and strive to do better if they don't. Advocate National Product Raw Materials Yí Yí Guǎn Zhǔ In recent years, the Chinese people have been advocating national products, which can be described as "sparing no effort." However, I feel that everyone only knows how to promote national products, but few people pay attention to the raw materials of national products. This cannot be said to be "abandoning the fundamentals and pursuing the trivial." It is really a ridiculous thing to promote national products! Because, if the raw materials of national products are sourced from abroad, then this so-called "national product" is "nominal but not real!" On the surface, it is a national product, but because it is a product of a domestic factory, but in fact, its raw materials are "imported goods!" This point of interest is still overflowing. When I thought of this, I couldn't help but write this article. I hope that everyone will promote national products and also promote national product raw materials! National Product News of the Week The China Industrial Federation held its ninth member conference on the 21st. Gao Shiheng, head of the Nanyang Commercial Delegation, Hu Shicheng, deputy head, and Yang Chongfu, secretary, jointly reported to the government on the 22nd and presented a report to Wu Shichang. The Shanghai representative of the Ministry of Industry's planned National Products Joint Sales Company arrived in Beijing and the negotiations were successful. Preparations will begin soon. The International Trade Bureau is conducting a pilot program of domestic sales of special products, paying attention to international publicity and direct trade. The Ministry of Finance approved the exemption of transshipment tax for three years for the products of four companies: Jiangnan Acetic Acid Factory, Zhongming Wood Charcoal Substitute Oil Lamp, Kaicheng Company Sulfur Iron Mine, and China Automobile Company Parts. Spring and Autumn Anecdotes (Dài Zhōngxīn) Welcoming and sending off, I don't know how much spirit is sacrificed, how much time is wasted, and how much money is spent! Waiting late at night at the station is so pitiful? ...The more important people are, the more they like to take the night train. Who knows the suffering of the little clerks waiting for the adults and gentlemen? Welcoming guests is nothing more than spending some money and eating. This wind cannot be caught or held! What does it mean to cheer and make noise in front of the crowd? They leave when they leave, what more is there to talk about? Handkerchiefs wave frantically, aren't they afraid of sore hands and wind? What's the point? Seeing people boarding the ship, they are both sad and angry. Why do some people desperately pull others to welcome those important people they have never met? Why is welcoming important people sometimes done secretly? Waiting for the important people and following them out, is it honor or disgrace? Why don't many students who go to welcome people even know who they are welcoming? In a situation of changing allegiances, welcoming and sending off, sending off and welcoming, it is always the bad luck of the little clerks! Cold and Warm Chén Liàng Gradually, I like to walk on the sunny side of the road. A kind of lovely warmth flows down my spine, reaching my legs and feet. The blood flows smoothly and comfortably. A kind of light and heat from nature is just like the whispers of a lover and the smiles of a loving mother, which make people feel immeasurable gratitude from the bottom of their hearts. I don't know from what day on, I have developed a deep hatred for the side of the road that is not sunny. On the same road, although there are no brick walls or sharp iron fences to divide the two different realms. However, one side is dark, and the other side is bright, one side is cold, and the other side is warm. Like the rest of the passers-by, I love the light and warmth, and hate the darkness and coldness. This is enough to show that it is not I who make people biased in love and hatred. When it gets cold, there are very few people walking or resting on the street in places without sunlight. Small businesses have changed the direction of their stalls. Old women and young girls do some handicrafts in the sunlight, and even the "bums" sit down in the sunny corners of the walls to pick lice and rub their necks. I am a person who has always been in the sun. When I enter winter, my hands and feet lose their warmth. Therefore, when I meet enthusiastic people, I dare not learn the European style of shaking hands, so as not to cause cold stimulation to those enthusiastic friends. I remember that a poet shook hands with a girlfriend, and the girlfriend said in surprise: "Why are your hands so cold!" The poet hurriedly explained: "Miss, are my hands cold? But my heart is hot." This remark led him and her to the road of first love. I lack the poet's state of mind. It is always a pity. Fortunately, no young lady has come to shake hands with me, so there is no need to worry. The only way to remedy cold hands is to hold a teacup, not necessarily to drink tea, and it doesn't have to be tea. In the coldness, holding a cup of hot tea or boiling water in both hands and wandering around in the study can give you a gentle feeling of warmth. Even in the coldest weather, there is no need to sit around the stove, which can avoid the burning of the fire and avoid coal poisoning. Getting some warmth in the cold is considered a satisfactory life. Like the current world situation, I don't have the delusion of "giving charcoal in the snow." If I were to follow the trend, I would rather hold a hot teacup. Fortune Teller's Stall Wéi Jīng Dancing, I don't know why, although I can't be considered a thorough countryman, and at the same time, I am constantly being threatened by "not dancing is outdated," I have never been able to develop an interest in it. Although I have hugged the waists of dancers and smelled the fragrance of their powder, it was half a year ago. In the past half year, I have never given away a dance ticket, but after dinner every Saturday night, except for rainy nights, I always set up a fortune teller's stall in a certain dance hall. This can be said to be the new interest of the past half year. Setting up a fortune teller's stall in a dance hall means sitting and not dancing with a cup of tea. Starting from seven or eight o'clock in the evening, sitting for three or four hours, or even sitting until the dance hall closes, is all possible. In the eyes of the "dance hall filial sons," setting up a fortune teller's stall like this may be considered too boring and unmodern. However, in my experience, if you can persevere, you can get a lot of flavor. Because I visit a fixed stage once a week, I have a rough understanding of the personalities of some dancers. Although they make a living in the same environment of red lights and green wine, I can judge the level of their origins from their actions and gestures. From some rumors, I have been able to prove the accuracy of my guesses. Because one of them, a dancer who is not very popular, whom I think is a daughter of a good family, is said to be the daughter of a Xiàolián public official. But how did she become a dancer? This is a dumb riddle that I feel most concerned about in my heart. Dancers are so busy that they can't spare any time. Dancers who sit on the sidelines, the whole evening, except for repeatedly going in and out of the toilet to exercise, can hardly take any action. However, whether they are popular dancers or dancers who sit on the sidelines, they can't jump out of a common formula, that is, at most three months, they will no longer appear in this dance hall. Because the popular ones may have been hired by other dance halls. The ones who sit on the sidelines may have taken off their high heels and gone to find a down-to-earth life. Therefore, there is a constant appearance of new faces in the country of dancers. Only those middle-level dancers are the mainstays of the dance hall, and some of them can stay for more than half a year or a year. Accompanied by a cup of tea, sitting under the dim, misty lights, you can see all kinds of ups and downs in the sea of dance. At the same time, you can also see the postures of gentlemen and dancers, the sly looks of oil-smeared dancers, and the diligence of those who are in the position of trailers to please the dancers. All kinds of things that can be sung, cried, laughed, and pitied can satisfy the stimulation needs of onlookers. Therefore, I think setting up a fortune teller's stall is a kind of life with a special flavor. Fake Belly Shí Jiǔ "There are three unfilial acts, and having no descendants is the greatest." Since Mencius established this iron law, for thousands of years, the Chinese people have regarded passing on the lineage as the only major event. Men have even used this as a talisman to abuse their wives and concubines in order to satisfy their lust. The so-called "a great man has three wives and four concubines, what is so strange?" is still often said today. As for women, some of them are not good at bearing children themselves and cannot give birth to a baby boy. They have already felt that it is difficult to say that they are being treated coldly by their in-laws. What's more, "a good man is the one who is looked up to and relied on for life." If a good man takes a concubine to pass on the lineage, then who can they entrust their lives to! Ask the Child-Giving Guanyin, but the Child-Giving Guanyin does not say a word. Therefore, women who are good at scheming have the matter of faking a belly. Mr. A and Ms. B have been married for a long time, and their two daughters are already tall and beautiful. Now that men and women are equal, it seems that they cannot be said to have "no descendants." However, Mr. A often feels that something is lacking in his heart. It is natural to have ambitions because of lack. Therefore, the heart of taking a concubine began to beat. At first, he only used indirect methods with Ms. B. Knowing that it was ineffective, he often sighed long and short after meals and drinks, saying that it would be a vain wish to carry on the family tradition. However, Ms. B still ignored him. Soon after, Mr. A went out to work. Ms. B then came up with a plan to fake a belly. The method of faking a belly is said to be to tie a specially made big apron around the waist, filled with mung bean shells, gradually increasing until it looks like ten months of pregnancy. That fetus was brought from a certain infant care institution in the middle of the night for a price of ten yuan. Since then, Ms. B has been justified in sending a quick letter to Mr. A to report the good news, hiring a wet nurse, and holding a soup cake banquet. It is really like the proverb says, "acting as if it is a real thing." Who knows? Then how is Mr. A? Mr. A was not so happy to hear the good news. Originally, he didn't care about having descendants or not. He just wanted to take a concubine, to take a concubine and satisfy his lust. Therefore, Ms. B will eventually have no way to deal with him. Guide (Continued) Wáng Yú This is not an easy job. When guests have any questions on the way, they have to answer in detail in English. The interests of the guests are of course different. Some like to stroll on the streets, some are eager to see our Beijing opera, and some like to eat Chinese food, or go to dance halls and bars. If someone likes to play with women, he will take you to the house of saltwater girls, or to Dongyang Tangzi, or find Russian women, because those prostitutes have other benefits for the guides. After waiting until the guest is satisfied and says he wants to go back, he has to personally send you back to your original ship by car. Then the guide has to reach out to ask the guest for money. Special Feature: A Day in the Life of a Female Office Worker Wáng Shāpā Miss Zhang is a female office worker in a certain institution. Her monthly salary is only 30 yuan in legal tender. After deducting the aircraft donation of 2 jiao and the income tax of 5 fen, she actually receives only 29 yuan, 7 jiao, and 5 fen. However, the clothes and cosmetics, ornaments, etc. on her body must cost 100 yuan, because her cheongsam is changed every two or three days, and they are all very new. Sometimes, she has to change her suits. Of course, watches, high heels, and permed hair go without saying. Glasses and gloves are her treasures. Therefore, she often says: This meager salary of 30 yuan is not enough for me to cut a piece of clothing material once! At the earliest, she has to get up at 9 o'clock every day. Although the institution she serves stipulates that she signs in at 9 o'clock to work, she doesn't care. It takes half an hour to wash her face at home. It takes another half an hour to eat half a bowl of porridge, change clothes, and rest. By the time she takes the bus to the office, the electric clock at the entrance of the office is already 10:15. However, she still writes "Zhang ×× 9 o'clock" in the sign-in book as usual. This is still when she is happy. If she is unhappy, she asks the errand boy to call the director and say that Miss Zhang has something to do today and is taking a leave of absence and will not come. The first thing she does when she enters the office is to press the doorbell and ask the tea boy to wring a towel to wipe her face. After wiping her face, she drinks a cup of tea. After drinking the tea, she has to go to the women's toilet to urinate. After returning from urinating, she takes out the key to open the drawer to work. By the time she flips through it here and there, and picks up the pen to shake it a few times, the bell for the end of work has already been ringing. In the afternoon, she works at 1 o'clock. After she goes to the office, she has to wipe her face with a towel, drink tea, and go to the women's toilet as usual. She is very close to the women's toilet. On average, she has to go once every hour. Therefore, half an hour before the end of work, she has to sneak out for a while. After sneaking out, she prepares her wallet and shawl. As soon as the bell rings, she starts walking. After dinner, it is really rare to stay at home and listen to the radio. If it is not a dance hall, it is a movie theater. She always has to stay out until after 12 o'clock before she is willing to go home to sleep. Swapping the Phoenix and the Luan Zhāng Hènshuǐ Chapter 8 A Cup of Water Pledges the Heart; a Blue Lamp Talks of Witheredness; a Golden Hook Appoints the Finger; Red Beans Report Mutual Yearning Please tell him that it is the first time in my life to give someone something that I wear myself. Youmei said: Is there anything else? Menglan had a reluctant feeling for the ring finger, and just stroked it with the index finger of the other hand. Youmei said: Then I'll go, see you another day. Menglan silently watched him take the ring away. This ring had been hidden on Youmei's body for a total of forty-eight hours, and he still couldn't think of a way how to hand it over to Guoqi. He is a girl, and it is fundamentally inconvenient to pass on tokens for others. Second, Guoqi is the most thin-skinned person. Before explaining the situation, it would be very embarrassing for him to suddenly give him this ring. Finally, he suddenly thought, since he had promised to do things for others, he should do it. As long as his heart is bright and upright, what shame is there to be afraid of? With such a change of mind, he found a small Western-style envelope. He sealed the ring. Then he went to Zhang's house alone. It was noon that day, just after Aunt Zhang had taken a nap. She walked into the courtyard quietly, without a sound. Looking at the green bamboo curtain hanging outside Guoqi's window, it was swaying slightly in the wind. In the courtyard, the small tree cast a small round shadow on the mossy ground. Youmei called out "Aunt". Guoqi immediately replied in the house: "Miss Li, please come in and sit." As he said that, he was wearing a summer cloth long shirt and walked to the hall, buttoning his buttons. Youmei said: "Has the old lady taken a nap?" Guoqi nodded and said: "Yes." Youmei said: "Then I won't go in to disturb her." Saying this, his face straightened and he said: "I have a classmate who admires your talent very much. I guess my cousin understands. He and I are good friends, and we can be said to share weal and woe. So he doesn't hide anything from me. He also knows that we are relatives, so he entrusted me to bring something to you. As for the details, he must have a letter to notify you." (102) Traces of Travel: Pilgrimage to the Hometown of Zheng Chenggong Lán Rén The national hero Zheng Chenggong can be said to be a peerless hero. Under the iron hooves of the Hu Qing, who were like tigers and wolves, he was determined to restore the Ming Dynasty. His naval forces came and went, invincible. He died at the age of only thirty-five. Such a young hero is truly worthy of our admiration in this serious national crisis today! Zheng Chenggong's original name was Lin. The Ming Tang King bestowed the surname Zhu and changed his name to Chenggong. He was named the Earl of Zhongxiao. People called him Lord Guoxing. He was from Shijing Township, Nan'an County, Fujian Province. Shijing's name is said to be derived from a natural stone well at the foot of Baihe Mountain. The spring water is sweet and delicious. Beside it is a stone in the shape of a fairy crane, bowing its head to drink from it. It is one of the famous scenic spots in Shijing Township, and Shijing is named after it. During the Jin Dynasty, there was no village yet. In the Tang Dynasty, many people were seen coming there, presumably making a living by fishing. Therefore, they gathered to form a village. During the Ming Dynasty, more people came there, presumably making a living by fishing. Therefore, they gathered to form a village. In the Ming Dynasty, a patrol division was established. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, a general of Daying was stationed there. Because it is a coastal village in Nan'an County, the scenery is very beautiful. It is simply indescribable. I might as well describe it as follows. Shijing faces the Ma River. The Ma River is named because there is a stone in the river that looks like a horse. The scenery of the river is secluded, and the fishermen come and go, all like paintings. Around the village, there are twelve peaks, with a sloping terrain. Looking at them from a distance, they look like swallows skimming the river. Other places such as Crocodile Stone Mountain, White Crane Mountain, Yanlou Mountain, Zhanjing Mountain, Niuling, and Yangzi Mountain are all famous places far and near. At the foot of Ao Stone Mountain, there is a so-called Monkey Cave. The trees are quiet and secluded, not a place for the mundane world. Yanping Park was built in this place. Also, Zheng Chenggong's old fort, called Chongcheng, has only one city gate, and the rest is already dilapidated. According to the records, this was built by Qi Jiguang to defend against the Japanese pirates. It is probably a mistake to say that it is Zheng Gong's old fort. Also, the place where the magistrate of the county reported the victory over the Japanese pirates is on Yanlou Mountain. The Quanzhou Fuzhi Zheng Pu Ping Kou Ji calls the mountain a pier, which is the place where the bandits were defeated. Jinghai Gate is at the intersection of the streets, and there is also a monument on the platform next to it. Later generations changed its name to Zhongjie, which is not as good as the original name. Unfortunately, the handwriting on this monument is already very blurred. Shijing also has eight scenic spots, which are quite famous! 1. Five Horses Facing the River; 2. Yangzi Evening Glow; 3. Carp Spitting Pearls; 4. Quhe Drinking Spring; 5. Bisha Ring Belt; 6. Shuangyang Huabiao; 7. Shuanglong Crossing the Sea; 8. Zimao Presenting a Case. Shijing was originally a giant village. The villagers were engaged in fishing. Many people have gone to the Nanyang Islands to live. During the Qing Dynasty's relocation of the border, Shijing underwent a major change, and the place became a wasteland. Now, when digging the ground, the foundations of walls are still found from time to time. The villagers with the surname Zheng are the most, followed by the surname Xu. Counting the others, there are no less than no money people or so. Shijing is known everywhere as the place where the Zheng and Xu surnames are the largest. After Zheng Cheng Gong died, there are still jade belts and portraits of him and Concubine Dong. There are many imitations and photographs of this portrait. As for his tomb, it is on Fuchuan Mountain in Nan'an, about twenty li away from Shijing. Everyone calls it "Yanping King's Tomb." At the foot of Ao Stone Mountain, there is the Zheng Clan Ancestral Hall. Inside, in addition to enshrining the wooden tablets of past ancestors, the wooden tablets of Zheng Zhilong, Chenggong, Kejing, and Shuang are also present. The house has two courtyards. Mr. Xu Shiying, the Japanese ambassador, wrote the following couplet when he was the governor of Fujian Province in the fourth year of the Republic of China: The East Sea repeats Penghu and Taiwan, the scenery is the same, and there is a difference in the rivers and mountains when you look up; the Southern Sky leaves the ancestral hall, which is majestic and broad, and everyone knows the name. Now, a special ancestral hall for King Yanping has been built next to the ancestral hall, which is even more magnificent. After I finished writing this article, I felt that the current situation in Fujian is almost a world of traitors. I think Zheng Gong would not rest in peace even in the afterlife!</p>

<p>The Road to Health The Chief Editor of Kangjian Medical Society Based on the Latest Theories and Clinical Trials: Further Understanding of Gonorrhea Treatment Sòng Zhōngyù, Physician, Graduate of the Army Medical University Find an Extraordinary Treatment Using the Method of Refining Gold from Sand Judging from the results of many patients, gonorrhea is indeed a dangerous symptom of venereal disease, and its prognosis is mostly poor. According to my investigation, this is also because there has never been a specific treatment for gonorrhea, and some preparations even have great disadvantages! The key here is that most patients, in the beginning, find the urethral burning and stinging unbearable, and they can't wait to get a panacea to cure it immediately; therefore, they indiscriminately take some gonorrhea medicine, regardless of whether the medicine is right or harmful, which is a common thing! In fact, in the early stage of acute gonorrhea, the gonococcus is still in the urethra. If a sensitive and special treatment can be applied, it can be completely cured. At this time, if unofficial preparations are taken or membrane-permeable sterilization treatment is performed, it will instead induce the gonococcus into the reproductive tissue of the posterior urethra, resulting in prostatitis, seminal vesicle and testicular swelling, such as cystitis, nephritis, etc., which are all posterior urethral diseases. If a woman is infected with gonorrhea by her husband, it will cause uterine and vaginal inflammation, and red and white leucorrhea. In the end, gonorrhea, regardless of men or women, may develop arthritis that can cause disability. And leukorrhea and testicular swelling will inevitably lead to lifelong extinction of offspring, and their daily suffering is also very much! Originally, once the gonococcus invades the posterior urethra (i.e., when acute turns into chronic), its footprints have already spread to the blood and flowed to all parts of the body. Therefore, gonorrhea patients often have a feeling of soreness and pain in the body. Once osteomyelitis and pericarditis occur, it will endanger life. Do not treat it recklessly. Based on my clinical research of more than 20 years, I have practically proven that the protein-pigment complex preparation "Clinon" is indeed a specific drug for the above-mentioned various types of gonorrhea in men and women. It functions to reduce germs in all parts of the body, so it can be cured permanently after taking it. However, women's leukorrhea should be treated externally with "Cardilac." At the same time, you can wash the vagina with medicinal water. Recently, the newly invented "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" Antt Gonococci-Aqva is a special drug solution for both men and women to wash and inject the urethra externally. Perform according to the instructions, wash and inject once or twice a day, and you will see that urination is smooth and urine is clear. At the same time, take "Clinon" internally to clear the gonococcus, so it will be better faster! Endocrine Strike Endocrine Dysfunction and Sexual Impotence Wǔ Zhōnglín, Physician, Graduate of Nantong Medical University Abnormal Functioning of Sexual Tissues Caused by Masturbation Is Like a Capitalist Mistreating Workers and Causing a Strike Our human life is like a society. If there are unhealthy places in the society—then, the social pathology will appear immediately. Now the wave of strikes in Shanghai is surging day by day, and the reason naturally comes from the unequal treatment between labor and capital. However, the dysfunction of the endocrine system in our human body is also equivalent to the destruction of the organization in the society. Being in the process of development, being induced by the outside world and stimulated by the body, it leads to the bad habit of masturbation. It violates the secretory function of the youth gland, and Dan does it. It causes the loss of correct secretory work, which is equivalent to the strike of the endocrine system. And hundreds of diseases will occur. Such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, weak penis erection, blood circulation disorders, anemia, and withered complexion. Headache, insomnia, and forgetting what you read quickly, etc., and incomplete lower body development are common symptoms for those who masturbate and have excessive sexual activity. These symptoms are caused by the loss of hormones and the abnormality of the youth gland due to masturbation. Therefore, German Dr. Karmlam often said that the most effective treatment for youth gland diseases is "Bǔ Tǐ Kāng" invented by Mr. Méilún in Germany. This medicine is made from the hormones of brave and strong animals. After taking it, the following transfer will occur in a short period of time, and each organ, especially the sexual organs, will receive this hormone supply, and the vitality will re-sprout, and all the symptoms of spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation will be completely cured. Therefore, the disease is eliminated. Neurasthenia, such as insomnia and forgetfulness, can also be cured. After graduating from Nantong Medical University, I have repeatedly used "Bǔ Tǐ Kāng" to cure many young people with incomplete development. For example, a young man surnamed Fāng, who started masturbating at the age of fifteen, caused incomplete development. Later, his family forced him to marry early, so he also had the symptoms of spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and inability to erect. The relationship between the couple was cold, and later they were instructed to take "Bǔ Tǐ Kāng" and "Nài Ér Sī Spermatorrhea Tablets" from Wuzhou Pharmacy, three bottles each, and they were cured. The relationship between the couple was happy, and they had another son before they were cured for a year. Another Case of Gonorrhea Posterior Urethritis Cured Yáo Júyán, Physician Patient Mr. Wáng Zhōngtíng, 26 years old, from Chángdé. Previously, due to one prostitution, and failure to treat it, it turned into posterior urethritis, with frequent urination, and abnormal pain. He had to urinate four or five times every hour. Each time he urinated, there were also sporadic blood spots mixed in the purulent discharge. He was examined with a urethral reflector, and the mucous membrane was red and swollen, and there was an invasive state. (As shown in the first picture) Also, because the urine could not be completely discharged, his lower abdomen was distended and painful, and he was at risk of becoming uremic. After the operation to clear the discharge, he was instructed to take "Clinon" internally and "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally for injection at home. After taking the medicine for four weeks, the urination was smooth and the swelling and pain disappeared completely. A urethroscopic examination showed that the urethral mucosa had completely returned to its original state. (As shown in the second picture) (First picture) Before taking "Clinon" and using "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally. Mucosal inflammation and swelling, mostly in an erosive state. (Second picture) After taking "Clinon" and using "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally, the gonorrhea was completely eliminated, and the mucosal swelling and pain disappeared. Self-Treatment of Leukorrhea Chén Shàohuá, Physician Leukorrhea is a very popular disease among us women. However, because its onset is not fierce, no one pays attention to it. Also, because it is regarded as a hidden danger, they are unwilling to go to the doctor, so they let it go without treatment. As a result, the vagina is corroded, and the foulness becomes more and more fierce. It is both harmful to sexual intercourse and easily causes obstacles to ovarian function. Therefore, menstrual irregularities are the main cause of infertility. Also, because leukorrhea is very toxic, there is a risk of blindness if it gets into the eyes. However, according to our experience, women's leukorrhea can be treated at home with "Cardilac Vaginal Tablets." Insert one tablet into the vagina as a suppository before going to bed. Wash it off the next morning. Those caused by gonorrhea can take "Clinon," and those with weak constitution can also take "Bǔ Nǚ Róng." Yáo Júyán's Gonorrhea Lecture</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Enamel Industry (Continued) (Shanghai Industry and Commerce Cotton Paper Report No. 38)</h3>
<p>— Compiled by the China Credit Telegraph Editor</p>
<p>3.  Zhu Feng Tong Ji Enamel Company – The predecessor of this factory was the Guangda Factory, founded by Americans. In 1920, it was reorganized into the Zhu Feng Enamel Factory. In 1924, due to business losses and inability to sustain operations, it was transferred to Mr. Tong Shiheng for sole proprietorship, adding the words "Tong Ji" to distinguish it. In 1929, it was again reorganized into a joint-stock limited company, increasing the capital to 300,000 yuan. Subsequently, due to the impact of labor unrest and the "January 28th Incident," the losses were significant. In 1934, a Restoration Committee was established to strengthen its reorganization. Almost all affairs within the factory were managed by Mr. Tong Shiheng alone. The current directors of the factory are Chen Dezhang, Tong Shiheng, Jin Guzhi, Wu Yunzhai, Tang Qiudi, Tong Shoumin, and Ye Jianxiu, a total of seven gentlemen. The supervisors are He Jingzhi and Xia Xiaofang, two gentlemen. The factory's sales office is located at 228 Avenue Edward VII, and the factory is located at 476 Hengbang Road, Zhabei, covering an area of 45 mu. The factory buildings are divided into blank making, printing, enamel coating workshops, as well as powder mixing, decal pasting, and mold repairing rooms, with a complete scale. It has seven or eight furnaces and employs over three hundred workers. The products use "Three Victories" as a trademark. The factory relies on Manager Tong's keen management, and the business is improving day by day. Furthermore, by saving expenses, it is expected to still have a considerable surplus this year.</p>
<p>4.  China Enamel Co., Ltd. – The predecessor of this company was the enamel department of the China Vocational School, originally for students' practical training. In 1922, as the school was unwilling to continue operating it, it was taken over by Chen Dezhang and Fang Jiange, transforming the department into a factory. At that time, the capital was only 4,000 yuan. After 1928, it was reorganized into a joint-stock limited company, with the capital increasing to 60,000 yuan. At the end of the year before last, it further increased to 120,000 yuan. Mr. Pan Yangyao is the current managing director. Shen Panqing, Huang Luobei, and Yao Shanfu are the current directors, and Zhang Jiyou and Pan Zhixing are the current supervisors. The factory's general sales office and office are located at No. 50-6 Laobeimen Road. Branch sales offices are also located in the Penglai Market in Nanshi and the National Goods Market on Henan Road. Branch sales offices are also located in Hangzhou, Hankou, and Nanjing. There are three factory locations: Factory 1 is at No. 54 Yingdong Road, Nanshi, and the factory buildings are rented from the China Vocational School. Factory 2 is at No. 7, Lane 518, Weining Road, Nanshi, with buildings built on rented land, covering an area of nearly six mu. Factory 3 is in Puyi Lane, Chezhan Road, Nanshi, also with buildings built on rented land, covering an area of six mu. The factory has more than 20 machines, valued at more than 44,000 yuan, and depreciation reserve of more than 43,000 yuan. The products use "Standing Crane" as a trademark. The factory is known for its stability, so even though the market is sluggish, it still has surplus profits every year. The total business volume for 1935 was more than 670,000 yuan, with a net profit of more than 20,000 yuan.</p>
