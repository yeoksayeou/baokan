<h3>靑島事件之嚴重性</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>在綏邊烽火正吿緊急之際。而景物宜人之靑島市。又突然攪起無端之風雲。日艦陸戰隊千餘名。武裝登岸。密布崗位。包圍黨警機關。搜索圖書文件。又復毆辱職工。濫捕人士。割斷電綫。肆行無忌。雖被逮諸人。旋卽釋出。而成羣日兵。依然逗留市面。執行梭巡職務。以友邦駐泊之軍隊。有如此越軌之行動。豈特駭國人之聽聞。抑亦爲並世所震驚。今後變化如何。猶難逆睹。而中日兩國間不絕如樓之友誼維擊。至是又遭受意外之摧隳。以造成更趨緊張之局勢。則固目前明白確定無可否認之事實也。</p>
<p>此次事變之肇端。在日方藉口工潮之惡化。逕作斷然之措置。而按諸事實。適得其反。查日商在靑所設之紡續廠。共有九家。最近大康等三廠工人。以要求增加工資。而有怠工之情事。迭經地方官廳之調處。原已有捎弭之可能。乃廠方突於前日會同議决。。一律停工。卽在未經參加怠工之公大滄口等六廠。亦復悉數予以鎖閉。一方令三萬勞工。遽陷失業。一方則調艦遺兵。故涉慌張。馬昭用心。路人皆知。不然。以念工之細故。原社會所習見。果能披誠相與。不難使歸平息。奚事疑猜紛紜。轉成不了之局。且卽如日方所聲述。感經營之無法。則亦自有其適當探取之步驟。分別應付之必要。何至幷未曾參加工潮之六廠。而一律予以停閉。更何至借重軍隊非法之手段。以造成不可究詰之情勢。外電稱日武官矢作少佐之來靑。與此次武力行動有關。識曲聽眞。固已慨乎其言之矣。</p>
<p>靑市長沈鴻烈於事變發生後。卽向日領提出抗議。而外長張羣於會晤川越大使時。亦面提要求三點。此後交涉之進行。誠爲一般所注視。尙有一節吾人須特別提示者。以我國領土所在地。而忽來外國軍隊之蹂躪。以尊嚴所寄之黨部。而竟任外兵包圍與搜查。以堂堂機關之領袖。而無端遭受非法之逮捕。則國家主權一語。尙復成何解說。就令交涉結果。日兵撤退。文件返還。而此一幕侵犯主權之事實。豈容吾人隱忍含胡而過去。在外部發言人一再申述擁護領土主權之决心以後。而竟有此公然侵犯主權之事實發生。當局之悲憤。自無待言。爲貫澈主張計。果將以何術盡其最大之努力乎。</p>

<p>（倫敦）今日下午英首相鮑爾溫氏在下院宣稱、政府方面不準備提出法制、以便利英皇所主張之婚事、目下所討論之事件、係與聯邦全部有共同之關係、不得各自治領之同意、此項變動决難發生效力、鮑氏又稱、彼向各方詢問之結果、極爲滿意，因對此事皆無同意之表示也、鮑氏復云、「全自覺在本日散會之前、發表此項宣言、甚爲得體、因藉此可銷除誤會也、目下余並無其他之意見表示」云、鮑氏又答覆勞工反對黨領袖阿特里氏質問云、曾有某某數報主張英皇如必欲與辛浦森夫人結婚、其名義未必定爲皇后云云、此種觀念並無任何憲法上之根據、英國法律中、亦無此類貴賤聯姻之前例可援、按一七七二年所頒佈之皇家婚事法案、對於英皇本人並無規定、僅載明共他皇族中人之婚事、如未獲國皇之許可卽不生效力、此法與目下事伴毫無關係、英皇固可不必獲得任何其他當局之許可、惟其所娶之女子名義上必須稱爲皇后也、欲先去此種結果之唯一辦法、卽對此特殊事件另立法律、惟其政府並不準備提出此項辦法、且如欲有所改革、亦必須各自治領同意後、始能發生效力也、鮑氏語畢、隨即散會、（四日路透電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）據悉、太后瑪麗曾直接或問接向干表示、不贊成與辛夫人之關係、約克公今日謁見太后時、亦頗多間言、王則尙懇求太后、惟當時太后共爲不悅云、（三日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）王今日偕的克公省視太后後、卽返白金漢宮、外傳太后與瑪麗公主曾於王辭出後、相對而泣、（三日國民電）</p>
<h3>憲法上發生爭點　英帝國圖窮匕見　首相奔走調和憂形於色　各自治領願為政府聲援</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據消息靈通方面聲稱、英皇昨夜與母后皇弟首相鮑爾溫會商後、因憲法爭執所引起之局勢、巳大見和緩、衆信現正考慮可由英皇內閣自治領政府諸有關方面接受之調和建議、其性質尙未宣露、今晨十一時下院重行開會時、首相對該問題仍不肯有所公布、首相以疲乏之語調蒼白憂切之面容、答覆反對黨領袖艾特里之問話、謂渠在此際無言可吿、艾氏又問似在何時、始可以此事眞相向衆公布、首相答稱、渠固知下院對於此事至爲關切、亟欲知其眞相、但渠目前不能續有所言云、上院亦於今晨十一時集議、惟稍逾一分鐘卽延會、今日下院開會前、閣員曾會商兩小時之久、大的午後仍將會商、因諸閣員皆取銷其日間的辦之諸事也、英皇在比爾維特爾堡睡的四小時，侵晨卽興、未在園中作每晨輒行之散步、晨間皇弟的克公爵乘車赴瑪爾波羅廈與母后會商、公爵之私人秘書亦至唐寗街十號訪問首相、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）帝國與內國政府之意見、今皆以爲英皇婚事已臻「圖窮匕首見」之地步、英皇非與辛浦森夫人割愛、卽不得不遜位、二者必居其一、衆信自洽領各政府均堅决贊助內國政府之意見、曾毅然聲明帝國各自治領决不贊成目前之婚事云、倫敦與各自治領都會間現來往之電報、接續不斷、豫料一二日內定有切實之决議、內閣白金漢宮與曼麗太后所居之瑪爾波羅廈、均忙碌至午夜後始已、昨夜九時十五分首相鮑爾溫入白金漢宮覲見英皇、歷五十五鐘始出、十時四十分、英皇乘車赴瑪爾波羅廈見母后、而於四十分鐘後回宮、維時首相赴下院與財相張伯倫·自治飯大臣麥唐納·南菲聯邦駐倫敦辦事專員華特·加拿大駐倫敦辦事專員麥賽會商、十時四十分首相離院、二十分鐘後、麥唐納華特麥賽三人同至自治領部繼續會商、華麥二人於十一時四十分與麥作別、二人皆稱無意見發表而將返寓、麥氏於午夜後十分鐘始出自治領部、</p>
<p>下院於昨晚七時五十五分延會、各員因憲法上發生爭點、較常日早三小時辦竣例行公事、兩院於今晨十一時集議、</p>
<p>聞自治領現依威斯明斯特法規施行彼等之權利、凡彼等信爲涉及自治頒之任何問題、將向英皇直接呈詞、彼等致內國政府之電文意見堅决、故英皇今不特須對付其內閣、且須對付代表帝國中各政府意見之各團矣、自治頒表示之意見、反映自治領對於美國各報之紀載毫未加以遏阻一節、至爲關切、蓋恐長此繼續、將有影饗及於帝國全部也、</p>
<p>衆意內國政府未必將創訂法制、而使結婚有通融之方式、縱使有合法之可能、而亦爲一疑問也、閣員顯不能迫皇委棄愛人、或實行遜位、而皇則能免閣員之職、否則內閣亦可自行辭職、表示不滿、但在目前時勢中、內閣辭職後、實難得適合之人物以代之、故爲國家與帝國大局計、免職與辭職似無一能成事實也、</p>
<p>現因自治領直接關切此事、其來電所表示之意見、均須加以注意、故政府至早須於一二日內始能作最後之決議也、</p>
<p>昨日白金漢宮與唐寗街相邸附近均有羣衆　集、竚立多時、足徵人民關事此事之股切、各報皆紀載首相與下院反對黨領袖艾特利及駐倫敦各自治領辦事專員會商情形、衆皆注重此項會商、（四日路透電）</p>

<h3>英下議院　討論大婚問題　加冕縱無玉敎主持典禮　國會仍應向王宣誓效忠　—反對黨員驚人動議—</h3>
<p>（倫敦）下議院本日午後開會時、反對派工黨領袖阿德里少校、曾就國王大婚問題向首相鮑爾溫提出質問、其時議塲座無隙地、然均肅穆無譁、阿德里少校常謂、「憲法是否已發牛困難乎、首相是否將於本日發表官言乎」、首相當卽退席數分鐘後、復行列席、其時面容慘淡、當答稱、「余目前不擬發表何項宣言、至所謂憲法上之困難、目前尚未存在、情形如斯、諸君向余提出質問、殊屬不合時宜」云、極端派保守黨領袖邱吉爾繼起發言、謂「首相能向吾儕提出保蹬、在向國會發表正式宣言之前、不致有何不可挽回之舉動乎」、首相答稱、「邱吉爾君此項問題余當加以考慮、但余此際所言、僅此爲止」、阿德里少校繼又提出質問謂、「目前人心惶惶、首相是否可向下院保瞪、俾儘速發表宣言乎」、首相答稱、此項要求自當加以考慮、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>至是前閣員韋治胡德大佐（前下院自由黨議員、今屬超然派、坐反對黨席中）、在下院提出動議、謂效忠英皇之誓詞、不謂因加冕禮之任何方式、或加冕時任何高貴者缺席而受影響、下院且不得奉戴他人爲英皇、下院議員對此動議、大爲惶惑、路透電社探悉韋氏所稱任何高貴者缺席、乃指康特白里大主敎。勃萊德福特主敎首相。暨其他人物而言、韋氏語路透訪員、加冕之宗敎儀式、不過爲一種敎會舊規、除守慣統習憤之志願外、與英國人民毫無關係、無論如何、皇必爲皇、當不惜代價、避免遜位之實現云、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>韋氏又宣稱、無論如何遜位之舉、務當股法避免、蓋「今王極得人民愛戴、王位倘有變動、足使全國陷入分裂狀態、假令下議院舉行改選、俾就遜位問題徵詢人民意見、則其結果、人民亦必歸附國王也、總之此項問題不應僅由內閣加以决定、而應取决於國會全體、與李却二世時無異」云云、（按李却二世生於一三六七年、薨於一四〇〇年、曾於一三九九年遜位）（三日路透電）</p>
<h3>測騐民意舉行總選　　韋氏主張各方響應</h3>
<p>（倫敦）韋治胡德在下院之動議消息旣播、韋氏於頃刻間卽接函電五十通、贊助其當不惜代價、避免英皇遜位實現之意見、並主張舉行總選舉、俾求全國贊助英皇云、（三日路透電）</p>
<h3>倫敦輿論　充滿擁戴熱忱　平民非偶傅統慣例　希望覓求妥善辦法　使遜位不致於實現</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日泰晤士報載有社論一篇、對於反對英皇與辛浦森夫人之婚事有所說明、略稱吾人對於反對英皇所提議婚事之性質、切勿發生誤會、須知所以引起反對之根源、他國報紙已有審愼之紀載、本國輿論界亦已屢有表示、均以爲除由於一種習俗相傳之慣例、不欲國皇與一平民或美國女子結婚是也、如英皇幸能博得其國民之一之愛情、然後全國皆將分享其快樂、且更自多數美國人民之女兒、彼或可獲得同樣之讚許而與之結婚也、惟此次英皇所提議之婚事、有一絕大之障碍、卽皇所擬娶之女子、已經兩度離異、且其兩前夫今均猶存於世也云云、</p>
<p>該報又稱、英國現有一種普遍之印象、卽英皇已將其欲結婚之意通告內閣、各閣員對於英皇所選擇之配偶、已加以反對之干預、又據本日該報議院訪員聲稱、此事之眞相卽英皇已有表示、故締結一種婚事之需議院通過特別法案者、其本人已首先詢問此事能否獲得通過、而各部大臣皆答以不可能云、於是各閣員干涉英皇私事之理論、已難加以辯護云、</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國各報對於英皇婚事之批評、仍極和緩、且對皇之本身均滿充熱烈之愛戴及同情、今日英倫有銷路甚廣之大報數家、已漸有不願見英皇官布遜位之表示、例如每日郵報中、卽載有消息一段、謂昨晚有民衆七千餘人、集議於亞爾倍會黨、羣呼英皇萬歲並唱國歌、神情全爲興奮、據該報宣稱、遜位事可不成問題、因此事之種種可能的弊害將無限制、且使大英帝國受莫大之影響、因此聯邦國家、際此世界空前危機時代、决不能捨去此富於天才智識之國皇也、該報又云、「遜位事决不致實現、英皇及各閣員、必須設法解决此事、國民正需要彼等之國君、蓋今皇對帝國服務、至爲忠誠熱烈、全國民心對彼極爲擁護也云云、每日捷聞則於其論文內、發問曰、「吾人對於今皇、願失去之乎、抑願保留之乎、其答案、固不難於國民之表示見之也、彙聞報則謂目下已有種種徵象、可見國民對英皇之同情心理、日趨滋長、並感覺皇之遜位必將引起不幸、現時如有一種解决辦法、英皇及閣員均能予以接受、英國人民必將感覺非常之欣慰、倘使因急遲之决定、而使帝國失去其所愛戴之國皇、則國家必將感受損失、固不待言也云云、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>每日電聞報載稱、「國王或則結婚或則遜位、務當擇一而行之此在全體閣員則兢兢業業、惟在保全國王個人與英國王室之尊嚴、觀於鮑爾溫首相昨日出席下議院時、在塲議員、均向之歡呼、於以見內閣態度已得各黨之贊助、卽各自治領總理亦莫不加以聲援也」、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法外長　將發宣言　履行援英義務　響慶艾登言論</h3>

<h3>紗花　標紗至收盤　同見新高價　本月期二六二元五角　現紗成交一千二百包</h3>
<p>上回跌之紗市、昨日復告上騰、且漲勢殊烈、所持理由、以現金存義缺乏、倉庫中僅剩千包左右、同時靑島日紗廠有紗綫錠子五十萬枚、已全部停業、北帮又來採辦、蜀帮進意亦濃、然各廠苦無現貨盡量供給、人心激昂、市價乃節節前進、十二月復出六十元關外、再創二百六十元元半之新高價、</p>
<p>各月期各漲六七元</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月均呈上漲之勢，但靑島日水兵登陸、及該處紗廠全部停業兩項消息、一般以爲似有矛盾、人心參差不一、二盤以後十二月期漲力殊强、迫近六十元關日、多說靑島紗價大漲、天津帮採辦現紗、蜀帮亦動辦、由此市勢愈形緊俏、步開步跳、本日漲出六十元外、收盤遠期牽入佳境、結果、各月比上日收盤價均漲四元半至五元三角、午後開盤、市情依然挺秀、近月漲力仍熾、遠期略平、二盤市上浮言又起、忽跌一元三·四角、迫至三收盤、聞現紗交易仍有一千二百包外、人氣重振、各日一致見最高價、收盤結果各月比上午收盤價再漲一元六角至二元四角、査賣出聚興二千包、裕大一千一百包、振大二千四百包、明華九百五十包、義成三千四百包、泰昌一千八百包、益昶一千八百五十包、恒昌一千包、生源一千八白五十包、長餘一千七百包、恒德三千包、大昌成一千六百包、買進恒益一千七百五十包、大豐三千七百包、明德三千五百五十包、合興三千七百包、長豐八千七百五十包、同和一千零五十包、錦昌一千三百包、愼記二千包、潤康二千三百包、福康二千包信誠二千包、茲比較於下、</p>
<p>現紗亦加起三元</p>
<p>現紗銷路尙屬不薄、査全日各帮買去統計一千二百十包、售價漲二·元、上日十支五獅、係五星、抄行情單者誤筆、附此更正、各帮買額如下、</p>
<h3>同是受靑島罷工影響　棉價反感不支</h3>
<p>棉市本屬平淡、但紗市日見上升、唇齒相依之原料、疲其牽動、然靑島紗疲停工、人心受其打擊、市價穩靜、漲勢緩和、廠需尙堪維持云、</p>
<p>多少得期紗助力</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、市象疲憊不振、以靑島紗廠一律停工、人心受其重大打擊、兼之美印棉市傾向下游、塲中買者不旺、二盤以後、因紗市良好、市况略形激昂、結果各月比上日收盤價漲一角半至三角、午後開盤、價仍參差不齊、入後紗價再創高價、市氣振動而堅、結果各月比上午收盤價再漲一角半至二角半、査賣出生源二千八百担、娶興三千担、明德一萬〇七百擔、豐泰二千七百擔、愼記三千六百擔、義成三千六百擔、益昶三千　、永大五千五百擔、源興昌七千九百擔、昶記二千　、長豐二千擔、買進、合興二千六百擔、裕大四千六百擔、仁豐一千三百擔、恊成三千七百擔、信誠六千五百担、長和六千担、振大五千担、賡豐二千七百担、大昌成二千九百担、同和二千四百担、比較如下、</p>
<p>到貨以通花爲多</p>
<p>現棉消費稍滯、廠胃轉呆、來源姚花三百</p>
<h3>美棉至收市始堅</h3>
<p>美棉開盤、各月跌七至十二磅音、交易較呆、利物浦消　不佳、英國政局不安、十二月期因有交割通知單　十四紙、多頭了結、外商套賣、均爲晨初跌價之因、日後、同業買進、空戶抵補、股市有力、市况回堅、業外新戶漸增、買戶依然審愼、收盤堅穩、計現貨漲一磅音、期貨跌三磅音·至漲二磅音、英棉貨跌一點、期貨跌五六點、印棉投機家買進、爲套賣所推　、後因利物浦消島不佳而疲、計平果爾及奧姆辣跌一羅比、白羅溪跌〇•七五羅比、原電錄左、（三日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、四日開盤預測、白羅溪爲二百十九羅比、輿姆辣爲一百九十八羅比、平果爾爲一百六十羅比二五、均不動、</p>
<p>四日大阪電、三品期紗漲七角至跌一元一角、近月爲二百四十四元七角、遠月爲二百十七元九角、期棉跌二角五分至五角五分、近月爲六十七元一角、遠月爲六十七元九角、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布易漲難跌　漂布漲已近一元　昨又各貨漲起數角</h3>
<p>昨棉布市况、以南北銷路暢旺、日華紗廠又起工潮、紗價前日梢一回軟、昨又反漲過頭、人氣一致堅昂、進意大濃、隨漲市購進、致市盤扶搖直上、粗布前以北銷不暢、重磅粗布漲勢尤為緩和、現下貨底枯竭、漲勢湍急、昨市又猛升（每疋）三·四角、輕磅精布漲二角、細布細斜原布色布漲（每疋）一角至二角、花絨直貢絨呢亦繼漲（每碼）二厘半、更以漂布現下　失令之貨、市盤頗低、而廠方新坯布漲勢甚急、相距殊遠現在距遠路客銷時期已甚密邇、故近日高檔漂布存貨、迅速提漲近（每疋）一元之巨、印花直貢嗶嘰色子貢色丁花布雖在淡令、亦以坯布價格、大非昔比、人心看好、銷路亦稍轉　、市盤回漲每疋二·三•五角不等、日商東棉日信伊藤等行、前昨共開出二·三月份白貨細布細斜近二千件、價亦步增、惟與現貨售盤尙低過五角左右、一月份貨額業經開罄、廠家現貨逐日派出、尙不敷客需云、</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初平繼則猛漲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥加拿大回小一二角不等、利物浦亦跌一二便士之巨、故開價時、本月份市面、曾見軟弱、開價祗九角六分、較前日跌　分、惟一月份開始、因業外買氣激昂、陸續暢吸、開價卽跳二三分、二盤以後、廠家抵補近期、故開價亦衝出四元大關、遠期則廠方套售、故買氣雖盛、漲度尙覺平和、迨至下午開盤、本月份因客帮亦有問訊、廠方又有略補、開價曾高至四元零四分旋則多頭了結、回落一二分、遠期則業外大戶、依然猛吸、市氣續騰、照目下情形、終以國內籌碼缺乏、洋麥又未能脗合、人心當未能半定云、</p>
<h3>小麥市况平穩</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初平後穩之象、以洋麥報價、一致報跌、不過市塲人心、因國內麥價、未易鬆落、北路一帶、則以軍用及民間之購囤、趨勢　較本埠爲俏、是以洋麥雖跌、市氣依然堅硬、各月份祗互有一二分之出人、迨至下午開盤、人心重佳、傳天津廠家、微有期貨購買、陝帮亦續吸現麥、致交易轉暢、市面轉升三四分、不過市値究已昂貴、買戶亦不免觀望、漲勢漸平、亦非無因也、現麥市面、因客戶扳售、廠胃未貪、故無正式見交、祗聞陝帮吸進二十餘噸、高郵麥開六元五角半、羊河麥六元六角云、</p>
<h3>客秈昨日粵銷復暢</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、來源依然續續不斷貨主大多有意求售、故河　米雖有罷斛與阻運之舉、而客秈市價並不見好、蓋客秈去路以粵銷爲主要、今粵　久無暢胃、市面乃呈供過於求、形勢立見下趨矣、但前昨到頭略减、銷化尙活、市面仍可站住、汕頭與本街去化均活、午後有河南續辦、市形始見帶俏、全日開出贛米二千六百七十三包、湘米一千零五十包、溫合甬各米一千七白二十包、廠元五百包、價與前市相似云、</p>
<h3>粳米店銷在觀望中</h3>

<h3>首都特快籌備就緒　卽可定期實行</h3>
<p>京滬滬杭甬路局遵照鐵道部意旨、在南京與上海間、開辦「首都特快」、所有各項籌備、大體就緒、將再經數度鄭重試騐、卽可定期實行、茲將其籌備及試車經過、錄誌如下、</p>
<p>歷次速率</p>
<p>京滬鐵路因行車設備沿襲舊制、號誌轍鎖等多不完全、故行車速率極受限制、站與站間、規定最高速率爲每小時八十公里經過迎面轍尖時、規定最高速率爲每小時四十八公里、且全路除上海至南翔間、已加設雙軌外、均屬單軌、加以站點旣多、停開時間亦多、車次旣多交會時間亦多、故行車時間不易縮短、又沿綫與各公路之平交道、所在而有、行車過速、亦極易發生危險、然自二十年以來、京滬問各列車、行駛全程時間、亦已一再縮短、卽以特別快車爲例、二十二年三月一日修訂行車時刻七點四十八分、六月修訂行車時刻六點五十分、九月一日修訂行車時刻六點二十分、二十四年十二月二十一日修訂行車時刻五點五十分、本年五月間部長囑再硏究縮短京滬間特別快車之行車時間、希望將全程减至四小時、</p>
<p>三次試駛</p>
<p>該局遵部旨、當先令機務處王處長、於六月九十兩日、以C類機車掛客車六輛試駛、在吳縣無錫武進鎭江四站各略停、結果上行（由滬至京）實需時二百五十一分鐘、下行（由京至滬）實需時二百五十六分鐘、嗣後令機務處王處長、工務處懷德好施代辦處長、車務處蕭處長、於十八十九兩日仍照上次、以C類機車掛客車六輛、會同試駛、結果上行實需時二百五十二分鐘、下行實需時二百五十五分鐘、總括兩次試駛、站與站間最高行車速度每小時均約爲八十公里經過迎面轍尖時、均在五十五公里至六十公里之間、四站之停靠時間、約共需時十八分鐘、但其時正當夏季、故能如此、若在冬令、蒸汽較爲難燒、父需供給客車暖汽、且卽在平時工程等限制亦所不免、故京滬間全程之行駛時間、實在當不止此數、至九月十五日、復由機務處干處長、工務處懷德好施代辦處長、偕京錫錫滬兩段關係人員、陪同鐵道部德籍顧問羅魯與馮洛侯、以C類機車掛客車六輛、作第三次試駛、由京至滬實需時二百五十九分鐘、</p>
<p>改良設備</p>
<p>試駛結果、固顯示京滬間行車時間尙有縮短之可能但欲實在行駛客列車、仍有先改良行車設備之必要、據工務處估計、如卽照全程四小時爲標準、則須將全路一律換舖重鋼軌及新枕木、並加固橋梁換新號誌等、約共需國幣四百二十九萬元、如暫以四小時五十分爲標準、則所需經費、約爲國幣七十五萬元、仍分兩部辦理、先需國幣約十九萬元、其後經呈鐵道部於八月十八日核准、先照四小時五十分鐘之標準試辦、於是所有改良行車設備工程、亦卽着手進行、其重要者、（一）裝設警吿號誌、計三十七站、（二）裝設銷轍器、均由奚福記承辦、（三）加墊枕木、每條鋼軌原墊枕木十四根、現每條加墊二根、共用五萬六千七百根、（四）加鋪道磕、用道磕一萬五千二百五十立方公尺、此外路基溝渠等、亦加以改善整理、計用巒石九千立方公尺、又片石二千八白七十五立方公尺、至各站授受路簽、經改用自動方式、又所需用機車之輛一列、一併加固飾新、機車係採用C類、惟該類機車之引輪輪徑只一〇七公厘、行車速率增高後、誠恐更易發熱、當擬改用輥座軸箱、車輛包括頭等客車（附餐車二輛、二等客車兩輛三等客車兩輛、及暖爐行李郵件車長車一輛、各客車均經加裝均熱油箱、以免燒軸、刻並新購客車底架三十三輛、將來「首都特快」之一列車、當全用此項最新式裝配之客車、又萬國臥車公司、擬就「首都特快」、加掛歐美最新式頭等客廳車輛、正在接洽中、</p>
<p>規定時刻</p>
<p>「首都特快」行車時刻、經呈奉鐵道部核定如下、（一）下行車列爲第一次車、每日十七點三十分、由南京下關站出發、經過鎮江西站、武進站、無錫站、吳縣站停靠、二十二點二十分到達上海北站、全程爲四小時五十分、（二）上行車列爲第二次車、每日八點由上海北站出發、停靠吳縣站、無錫站武進站、鎭江西站、十二點四十八分到達南京下關站、全程爲四小時四十八分、蓋卽將「首都特快」一列車、於每日上午由上海開往南京、下午由南京開回上海云、</p>

<h3>盜刦申新九廠工資　一盜中彈被擒　法幣一皮箱未遭損失　稽查與巡捕保全非小　獲盜受劇傷命在旦夕　另一盜乘隙逃逸無蹤</h3>
<p>昨晚九時許、滬西澳門路東京路申新第九廠、正在發放工資之際、突有於事前混入廠中雜於衆工人內身懷手槍之盜匪兩名躍出、將該廠賬房手中所持內儲一千八百元法幣之手提皮箱一隻刦奪圖逃、詎適被該廠稽查及廠中僱用之華捕二人撞見、該捕遂開槍追捕、結果一盜彈中腹部就擒、另一盜則被乘間逸去、至被刦之皮箱、完全珠還合浦、絲亳未蒙損失、詳情錄後、</p>
<p>發放工資</p>
<p>滬西澳門路東京路一四零號申新第九紗廠、循例於每月四日晚間發給工人工資、爲數輒在二三千元左右、昨日又屆發放工資之期、至晚間九時許、該廠賬房顧某携來手提皮箱一隻、內儲法幣一千八百元、尙有一千元則置於身畔衣袋內、逕至廠中、擬按名發放、</p>
<p>攫奪皮箱</p>
<p>詎顧某正待啟箱取欵分發之際、突由工人人叢中、躍出持有手槍之盜匪兩名、迫近顧之身旁、逼禁聲張、一盜卽將顧手中之皮箱攫奪、一盜執槍殿後、奔出塲屋、冀圖自裕門逃逸、</p>
<p>稽查經過</p>
<p>查甲新各廠前此曾屢次發生搶刦工資情事、廠方爲審愼起見、故嗣　後每屆發給工資之日、　防範特別注意、至該廠除平日僱有華捕十名、駐廠保護外並增加稽査人員、日夜分班防衛、以策安全、而當時兩盜正逃出塲屋時、適有該廠夜班稽査劉春蘭正偕同第七六七號華捕巡視經過、</p>
<p>一盜中彈</p>
<p>常時劉稽査正手持電筒四下探照、華捕執槍隨後、且巡且走、忽然瞥見兩人倉皇逃出、更見一人手提存放工資之皮箱、知有事變、待喝令止步、兩人竟棄箱亡命飛奔、該捕遂開槍向其轟擊、一彈命中刦箱一匪之腹部、立時倒地就擒、</p>
<p>工資無恙</p>
<p>尙有執槍一匪、卽乘隙自該廠後門逃逸無踪、此時稽查劉春蘭、卽偕該華捕先將皮箱檢拾、交還賬房顧某、點視箱內法幣、絲毫未失、一面電知普陀路捕房、捕頭立派中西包探馳往、將截獲傷盜車送工部局院醫救治、聞傷勢甚重、性命堪虞、</p>
<p>事後研究</p>
<p>事後經捕房調査結果、悉認此種刦案、完全爲事前有組織之行動、　非對廠中知之有素、决不致如此易於混入、且自後門逃脫之一匪、更有硏究之必要、蓋該處後門係通莫干山路、廠中除運進煤炭得臨時啟　通行外、平日均緊鎖下鍵、此次匪徒竟事先將該門設法　啟而預爲兔脫之餘地、若非預有組織、則其計劃决不致如是週密也、</p>

<p>（四）母心醫院開幕　該院係本市實業界及慈善界　子陸伯鴻君所創設，蓋陸氏鑒于閘北區域遼闊，住戶眾多，而尤以貧苦者為多，然適合於彼等之慈善醫院，尚覺不多，能較具規模者，更屬鳳毛麟角，爰於寶興路牛橋　附近，闢地二十餘畝，於本年三月初動工建築，其經費即由陸氏將前年六十大慶時所收禮金作基金，復承市政府及各慈善　捐助二千餘元，至八月底始告完成，聞全部建築費共達七萬元，內部設備完備，規模宏大。於本月二十六日開幕，據云每月經常續費約一千五百元以上，均由陸氏及市政府，南市水電公司，華商電車公司，內地自來水公司等擔負云。</p>
<p>（五）麗都公司新創　該公司係將　滬上富商稈貽澤君之住宅改建而成，內開跳舞廳，夜花園，大飯店，游泳池四部，範圍頗大，經理為馬積乾君，長袖善舞，前途未可限量。</p>
<p>製造工業類本月份新創者，與上月份同，閉歇者較上月份減一家，般情形與上月份相差甚微，惟棉紡織業因本年各地棉產豐收，花價逐步降低，且棉紗銷路漸形活躍，價格上昇，故已略見　機。茲將其較重要之異動分述如後。</p>
<p>（一）恒豐紡織所局出知復業　該局算我國紡織業之鼻祖，係聶雲台君獨資創辦，成立於光緒十六年，迄今已四十六年，資本總額，百十五萬　千元，為有限公司組織。現任廠長聶潞生君。挑有紗錠五一四·五　六枚，布機六一一台，電力·八〇〇匹，汽力一〇〇匹，工人三千三百餘人，職員一百五十餘人。每年用花七萬六千擔，出紗線二二·〇〇〇包，出布一〇·三六〇平方碼。廠其佔地四十餘畝，因其建築新穎，管理科學化，於我國紡歷史上，厥功甚偉。該局商業之初，營業逐步發展，其後歐戰爆發，該廠獲得頗鉅。故範圍日益擴大，除添設第二廠及布廠外，聶君復另創大中華紗廠於蕰藻浜，不意歐戰結束，英匯回漲，外紗傾銷，該廠遭此打擊，一時險為動搖，不得一廼將大中華廠出盤與永安紡織公司，復經銀行界竭力援助，始告脫險。以後數年間營業蕭條，直至民國十四年復見轉機民十九與二十年間重獲盈餘，然此後即因市面不振，購買力日趨薄弱，日花實紗賤，外貨傾銷，遂又重陷虧蝕，三年來竭力支持，負債達三百餘萬元，聶君以長此以往，前途恐不堪設想，故於今春停工，至今半載有餘。入秋後因各地棉產豐收，紗業前途重現轉機，故經浙江興業妊懷聶氏計劃磋商，決將該廠無條件賃租與中國棉業貿易公司加中記經營，訂期三年，聶氏退任該公司稽核及中棉公司顧問，另由中棉公司胡　庵君任經理，聘汪孚禮任協理及總工程師。至該公司前該浙江興業之債務，於租賃期決停止付息，如營業盈餘，則提百分之五，為聶氏生財微利，餘百分之九十五則由浙江興業中棉公司對拆，如有虧折，則全由中棉公司負責，當經三方訂立協定，於本月二七十日開工復業云。（未完）</p>

<h3>怎樣做一個革命的婦女？</h3>
<p>— 童亦珍</p>
<p>我們幾千年來，是在黑暗中過生活，政治上的壓迫，社會上的輕視，什麼「女子不得加入政治結社，」「婦孺何知」，「女子無才便是德」等等孺禮教的束縛，簡直束縛得我們透不過氣來，自從轟轟烈烈的「五四運動」以後，直接就掀起了我們「婦女運動」革命的波浪，大聲疾呼著「自由平等」！可是到現在快有二十年的光景了，我們的成績是怎樣呢？唉！很多的女同胞們仍舊束縛在層層的黑暗中，如此看來，我信應該要做一個革命的婦女，抱著「我不入地獄誰入地獄」的壯志，去拯救黑暗中的她們，那麼我們怎樣才做一個革命的婦女呢？依我的意見，應該努力地去實行幾個革命的條件：</p>
<p>（一）思想革命　我們古時向來是「治內」的，除了日常生活，家庭職務外，一切都不聞不問，試問這樣下去，那有「出山」的一天呢？西哲說：「思想者，事業之母也」，不錯，我們要做革命的婦女，去幹一番偉大的事業，就應該先從思想方面去著手，我們要努力地去打破幾年來的陳腐思想，來修養高超的思想。</p>
<p>（二）意志革命　我們的意志，是比較人家薄弱得多，受了外界的引誘以後，就很容易更變初衷，一味盲從，受人家支配，這是多麼的危險！我們要做革命的婦女，非把意志鍛鍊不可，意志能把持我們前途的一切，我們要充實勇氣，養成不屈不撓的毅力，和環境去奮鬥！</p>
<p>（三）習慣革命　我們向來流行的通病，像奢侈，虛榮，吝嗇，妒嫉等等都是最不好的習慣，習慣是品性的原素，這些都要意圖的避掉，我們需要的習慣，進取的精神和創造的魄力！</p>
<p>女同胞們！一致起來，我們要做革命的婦女，徒然的高唱，是無濟於事的，應該要切切實實的去做！尤其在這非常的時期，我們都要抱著「國將不國，何以為家」的決心，「皮之不存，毛將安附」的悲憤，我們要為自身要為國家來努力努力的革命！</p>
<h3>僑居我國的日本婦女</h3>
<p>— 一髮</p>
<p>日本人居留在我國的，雖然不多，但是內容十分複雜，在兩國國交正在調整的現在，各地發生了不幸事件的時候，我們對於僑居於我國內地的日本婦女，應有特殊的認識。</p>
<p>僑居在我國的日本婦女，大約可分三種，第一種是日本駐華官吏的家眷，或是日本大商人的家屬。這一類人數很少，平日深居簡出，不易和我們接近。在我國是暫居性質，短時間中便要回國的。第二種是我們常見的女子，是正當小商人的家屬。他們自己均開關鋪子，販賣經營，有半久居的狀態。第三種是不務正業的或是操著秘密職業的。他們可以到處為家，往來中日間，沒有一定居的留約期間。</p>
<p>東京一帶所謂關東地方的女子，身材較細，以鵝蛋臉為多。就是到中國來，都　是官吏我資本家的妻子女兒，知識程度很高，極能尊重自己人格的。在上海北四川路虹口一帶的日本女子，梳著很高的髪髻，拖著木屐的，都是小商人的家屬。時間住得長久之後，中國話也可以說幾句了，至少可以聽得懂上海白。他們的身材較東京人粗大，皮膚粗黑，顴骨很高，這都是九州神戶橫濱的人民，在國內無可發展而跟著丈夫到我國來經商的。倘若在我國生活無憂，故鄉並無可戀，伊們便可以一輩子不回祖國去。伊們已熟識我國人的心理，和我國男女交接，都十分客氣，和在國內對待同胞一樣。尤其是接待顧客，其應酬之殷，比我國商人更熟練。伊們的知識程度，雖不高明，但愛國愛鄉之心是極重的。伊們雖居我國，仍不買中國貨，常以集團居住，於是凡有日本人居住的地方，便有日本的商店，發買日本的貨物，伊們只願意到日本人的店裏去買日本貨，還不願意到中國店裏去買日本貨呢。在我國生育了子女之後，等到小學畢業，便送到日本親戚家去，受祖國的教育，所以除非是嫁給中國人的，普通商人的子女，是絕對不會被中國人同化的。</p>
<p>漂泊無定，不務正業的日本女子，尤以北平上海為多。伊們的職業終不脫舞女，娼妓，按摩女，咖啡女，酒侍等。而伊們的伴侶，有商人，軍隊，水手，浪人，混雜已極。因此終日沉緬於秘密生活的日本女子，其妖艷浪漫之態度，是一望而知的。我國喜低級趣味的人，也有雜足其間的，極易發生不幸事件，有害國際情感。年齡較長，色藝已衰的女子，為生活計，但不得不營私舞弊了。日本東京的「話」雜誌，記載華北的走私，和上海的私買銀元，最初都由中年的不良婦女為始的。為了國家邦交計，兩國的婦女界，應自尊尊人，互相敦睦親善才是。</p>
<h3>羅斯福夫人</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>美國總統夫人羅斯福夫人，本年因羅斯福氏的重被當選，於是遂賡續著度其四年的白宮女主人生活。查夫人在其已往的四年白宮生活中，已有不少的佳言懿行，足資述說的，茲特摭述如左。</p>
<p>夫人雖為白宮的女主人，然並不因其地位的崇高，而減少酬應。未貴時的女友，她是依然時相往還的。在白宮中，有幾間旅舍形的屋子，是專設著，供她的女友們來盤桓小住的。所以她的女友，不來則已，一來，部得住上一二個星期。有時，夫人若和女友談得高興時，竟會得不回到自己臥室去，而與女友同室的宿上一宵。若是她的女友，舉行宴會，而邀請夫人參與，除非因助丈夫辦理重要的事件，而實在無法分身之外，她是不論寒暑遠近，總是親往宴聚的。在去年的一月間，有一位遠在紐約的一位女友亡故了，定於下午三時半　殯，而偏巧這一天的上午，她忙得分不開身，於是只得於下午，搭著飛機，帶著花圈，趕往紐約，參與執　。而那一天的天氣，是異常惡劣，風雨交作，但夫人並不因此而中止前往。她的交友，大率皆類此。</p>
<p>愛好小孩子，是夫人的習性之一。在已往的四年中，她曾參與過小學校的畢業典禮，而授憑授獎，共有二十次以上。參與全國的兒童運動會，十餘次。參與各慈幼機關所舉行的同樂會之類，凡二十餘次。最遠，曾南至福洛裡達，西至亞裡頌那。這是前此的總統夫人，對於愛好兒童的表示，所從未有過的高紀錄。在前年的兒童節，去年的聖誕節，夫人都曾假日白宮，而執行兒童，備著茶點玩具，都曾盡情的樂一天。對於婦女，也極肯援助。若有一技之長的失業婦女，只須寫一封信給夫人，夫人便會給留心著，找尋適當的位置。據說，在這四年中，每年，平均總有三百五十四至四百人，被她介紹得合於自己所有的技能人位置。夫人對於貧無所依的老婦人，寫來的訴苦信，也總是復信，而加以慰藉，或致函所屬的州政府，請託代為固濟。夫人現任著若乾出版界的撰述之職，報酬之所得，完全捐助給國內的若乾慈幼機關。同時，他的地產股票之所得，完全捐贈給國內向她訴苦的老婦人們。據說，在這四年中在這二項之下，每年總得捐出二十萬元左右。</p>
<p>對於烹飪一事，夫人是很精擅的，而且她也很愛自己動手。平日的賓朋宴聚，總有一半菜餚，是自己動手烹製的。若是遇到大宴會時，至少，她也得自己親製一道菜，以享來賓。白宮中的廚房，是在一八八七年建築的，但於一九三三年，由夫人招集了若干工程師，加以翻建，而造成了一個最新式不過的廚房。從這一點上，也就可以見到夫人對於烹調一事的注意。</p>
<p>這些，便是美國第一婦人的生活的輪廓。據說，在已往的四年白宮生活中，夫人已減少了體重十五磅左右。面上的皺紋，也深刻了許多。但她的精神，卻還是那麼的健旺，因為夫人的身體，是十分康健的。在最近十年間，據說，沒曾因病而躺過一天。</p>
<h3>歌謠中的婦女問題</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>『小二姐，北軋車，北不動，四哥送，送到家，坐下就軋花，一軋軋到上午錯，婆婆給個糠窩窩，啖一口，好難過，跳井吧，井又深，跳河吧，河又高，扒著河沿四皇天！』</p>
<p>『太陽出來一盆花，厲害婆婆會當家，兒媳要來去做飯，一合小米往外抓，先燒火，後切菜，忙將米飯作出來，翁婆挖稠飯，兒媳喝菜湯，悽慘，悽慘，兒媳難當！』</p>
<p>『搥布石，登登響，我來配你十六兩，十個公公一個婆，十個小姑管著我：管的我腳尖不沾地，拿著羅圈打水去，腳又小，細又細，累的小腳怪痛的，螞蚱咬，啯啯四，我想家，誰知道？低低頭，看見娘家小門樓；毛毛腰，看見娘家槐樹梢。』</p>
<p>『小大姐，看皇會，走一走，跪一跪；走到家裏裏蒙牀被，公公打，婆婆罵，小姑子過來揪頭髪，揪一根，不理會，揪兩根，怪痛的；揪三根，跳河去，河又遠，跳井去，井又深，扒著井口罵媒人，媒人媒人婆，你賺錢，我受屈，一陣大風刮到娘家去，看看我的媽，杵大拐；看看我的爺，穿破鞋；看看我的妹，疊花被；看看我的嫂，疊花襖；看看我的哥，吃餑不讓我；狠心的爹娘不趕狗，撕了我的裙子咬了我的手氣的小姐快快走。』</p>
<p>上面這四首歌謠，在我國北方是很流行的。在這四首歌謠裏，我們可以一貫的看出：婆媳不和的真相，和婚姻和自由的痛苦。關心婦女幸福，以及領導婦女運動的人，對於這個問題，是不予以討論一下子的必要的。</p>
<p>就作者的愚見看來，要解決上面所提出的一個問題，根本的癥結，還是在於婦女的教育，沒有普及的緣故。我們一方面希望教育當局，要積極的普及全民教育使無論何人，不論男女，都有受到相當教育的機會。同時，尤其希望一般婦女界的領袖們，對於這個問題，提出來研究一番，定出一個適當的解決的方案，做一次大規模的宣傳與運動，引起一般人的注意。而後漸漸的才有解決的可能。拙見如此，未知閱者以為何如？</p>

<h3>李霞卿女士談航空救國</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>建設空軍　纔能立足於未來的世界　早為準備　應訓練技術高超的人材</p>
<p>航空救國，是全國同胞一致的呼聲，當此綏邊匪寇緊張，抗戰激烈的時候，敵機在我們的領空，橫行無忌，尤其覺得航空真是救國惟一的利器。這三四年來，經政府與人民熱烈的提倡，航空在我國，總算具備相當的成績，可是與列強比較還是相去甚遠，今而後必須盡力推進，繼能增加國防的力量。依現勢而論，我國飛機不能自供自給，人材不能普遍訓練；汽油不能大量開採；於航空事業的發展‘確是絕大的障礙。要是這三項我們都有了辦法，那可斷言中國航空是不會落於人後的。這裏單就第二項來說，航空人材的訓練，比別種技術，困難得多，學習者也特別的少。年來因國難愈深，青年愛國志士，投效空軍者已較踴躍，這是多難興邦的好現象。然而女子學習航空的，依然寥寥數人，因此我認為學航空的女子便是出類拔萃的巾幗英雄。關個月前，曾發表一篇楊瑾珣的航空生活，居然有十餘位女青年來信，問及飛行社的內容，這倒很有意思，所以今天再介紹一位李霞卿女士給讀者，相信必能引起諸位史深的同情。</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>李女士是廣東人，幼年就讀於香港聖大提凡學校，後來上海入中西女中，（幼時曾在她父親手創的民新影片公司充演員，別名李旦旦，如今她表示這已不值得回憶的了。）民十七年赴英留學二年，轉赴瑞士，在日內瓦住了四年，其中一半的時間，是在克萊姆卻利飛行社研習民用航空，畢業後又在美國波音飛行學校研究，該校是美國最著名的民用航空學校，在一百五十個學員中，女的衹有她一人，課程很繁重，晨八時至晚五時止，全在學科術科上用功夫，製造，裝配，修理，駕駛，什麼都幹；天文，地理，無線電，等各科具備；盲目飛行，畏途飛行，無線電指揮，降落傘等最新飛行術，什麼都學過了。她說：「我曾獲得瑞士的飛行執照兩張，美國一張，回國後經中央考騐及格，也發給執照，外間有人說我不會飛行，真是笑話，既有事實為證，似可不必多辯。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>我問她研究航空的動機，她說：「我喜好運動，比埋首窗下來得有趣，「一九一八」，「一二八」事變，連續發生，我遠居瑞士，神經大受刺激，想到敵機如此殘暴，我們女子要為國效命，惟有學習航空，於我自己的體力和興趣，都很相近，一則表示女子的自覺，能　時代前進，二則那麼大祖國，航空竟毫無建設（四年前的話）怎能立足於科學化的世界？實際上海軍不易擴充，陸軍非賴空軍合作，不能發施威力，這樣長的海岸線，隨時有受敵人控制的危險，只有建設空軍，機可以對抗，假使我們女子先行提倡，男子必不廿落後的，於是堅定了我的意願。」</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>「歐美各國女飛行家的數量，及中國航空界有那幾位女子？」我想她總會知道，便提出這疑問來，她想了一想；「歐美各國女子在航空界有貢獻的人也寥寥無幾，但從事學習的，卻與日俱進，數量方面，尚無正確的統計，據我所知的，美國各大城都有九九俱樂部，（Ninty-nine　club）會員以女子得有飛行執照的為限，少則二十人，多則四五十人，全美總數至少約五百人以上，蘇聯德國次之，英法又次之。以技術而論，大概蘇聯女子最為特色，因美國女子都從事民用航空，而蘇聯女子有參加軍事航空的。我國女子學習飛行的，最多不過六七人，如李月英，林鵬俠，王燦芝，但可惜我們學過就算了還不曾能為國家服務！本來學以致用，不用學也沒有意義；航空與其他學術不同，學不學在我，而用不用權在政府。目前政府所需要的是軍事航空人材，學民用的，絕少插足的機會。全國除「歐亞」及「中國」兩航空公司以外，還沒有第三家，需才實在有限的，但我相信將來一定是航空的世界，為國儲村，必須早為準備，技術學成了，英雄不愁沒有用武之地的。」</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>「在此國難時期，女士有何意見發表？」這句問話，似乎觸動了她愛國的心機，她滔滔不絕的講了十分鍾之久大意是說「中國當此存亡危急之秋，報國無分男女，必須有一分力，盡一分力，以我們學飛行的女子來說，雖不能編入空軍，上前線殺敵，儘可以組空軍中救護隊，空中輸送隊，　後方的工作。我自己是準備著了，虹橋，龍華，是我常到的地方，練習飛行，也是日常的功課，一旦政府徴募的命令來到，迅速奔命，願效先驅。近幾時我和顏雅清女士等正發起一個婦女集團，旨在喚起女子提倡航空事業，不會飛行而熱心或有志於此的女子，一概歡迎，只要能邀中央核準的話，便可順利進行。」最後又說，女子學航空，並非不可能的事，但須具有強健的體格，靈敏的手腦；堅強的意志；耐性及恒心；和打破家庭與社會的環境，最要緊的還在政府的提倡，鼓動，及民眾同情的心理。</p>
<h3>李女士在龍華駕機起飛時之神情（此機係海軍飛機製造處自造）</h3>
<h3>給全國婦女們的一封信</h3>
<p>— 肖白</p>
<p>——關於援綏的意見——</p>
<p>親愛的姊妹們：</p>
<p>我渴望著有一個和你們通信的機會，是已經很久了。可是，我一直就不能做到，現在，我因為又有許多很重要的事情，要非和你們談談不可，所以，我懇借這園地的一角，寫了這樣一封公開的信給你們：</p>
<p>在目前，我們的國家，顯然是已到了最後的關頭，尤其是最近偽匪軍的進攻緩遠，它企圖奪取我們僅存的國防第一錢，華北西北的屏障，如果我們還有人心，如果我們不願做敵人的順奴，那末，誰也感到當前是只有我們每一個國人奮勇起來，努力自救。我們全國的婦女們，是佔全國人口的半數，我們是也決不可再抱著隔岸觀火的態度，躲在一邊，我們要和男子們，共同來掀起民族自救的巨浪，參加和努力一切援綏的工作。</p>
<p>現在，我們前線忠勇的將士們，是已經展開了一幅英勇的衛國抗戰的場面，他們為了祖國的山河，為了民族的生存，已經在冰天雪地中，在砲火彌漫裏，浴血應戰，二十四日克復百　廟，那更是替國家爭回最大的光榮，值得全國民眾無限的景仰。</p>
<p>這兩星期多來全國各地民眾熱烈的援綏運動，更是值得我們欣慰和興奮。而我們姊妹們也紛紛組織救護隊，募捐慰勞戰士，這更足見我們婦女們，在努力救亡工作中，是英勇果敢的，我們也一樣地愛民族，愛國家，沒有忘掉了婦女在抗戰中應負的責任。</p>
<p>在這裏，我還要向全國婦女們，對當前的援綏工作，提出更具體的切實的三點，因為那是我們必須應該做到的。</p>
<p>第一，我們應該擴大救護的運動，我們已經懂得救護工作的，果然應設法赴前方救護戰士，我們沒有懂得的，更應該開始學習，因為那是在抗戰中我們婦女最重要的工作。</p>
<p>第二，我們要發起縫製寒衣的工作，和結絨線衫的運動，因為這是冰天雪地中戰士們的必需品，也是我們很迫切的主要的工作。</p>
<p>第三，我們要和男子們一樣努力募捐工作，能夠向自己的親戚姊妹中去勸募。</p>
<p>總之，現在是怒吼的時候了，我們不要空談，高聲吶喊，我們要大家切實地做去！姊妹們！希望你們加以討論，補充和立刻實行。</p>
<h3>佩英利伊的弟弟</h3>
<p>— 雪影</p>
<p>天，好無情的天，昨晚佩英利從廠裏回來的時候黑暗而醜惡的草鞋浜一帶的小路上，元是鋪罩著一派水銀似的月光，空氣中也不覺得有怎樣濃厚的濕氣，誰會想到今天竟下起不急不慢的長腳雨來了！</p>
<p>佩英在五點鍾就醒了，這倒不是雷把伊鬧醒的，而是一重重愁苦的心事激到了伊的心弦，使伊無論如何，困倦也不能再　熟：待到伊一醒，窗外的雨聲就跟著鑽進了伊的耳膜，伊也不用推出窗去瞧，一聽聲音便知道是不會馬上就停的長腳雨。</p>
<p>伊借著那一盞火　發了紅的煤油燈的燈光望桌子上摺著的一件新衣服看了一眼，忍不住又深深地嘆了一口氣。這件新衣服是伊節省了六個月的點心錢才做起來的，雖然不襯什麼皮，不襯什麼絲絨，駱駝絨，甚至連夾裏都不用，衹是一件薄綢的單衫，但從籌　，剪料，一直到裁製，已不知道耗去了伊多少的心思。可是這件衣服卻不是伊自己穿的，而是為伊弟弟做的。伊弟弟就躺在伊對面的那張床上，清秀而瘦削的小臉，使伊每次多看他一眼，就會多增加一分的愛憐。自從父親在關外給××獸軍慘殺之後，伊就盡伊所有的力量，使他從高小畢業，再進初中，再從初中畢業；並且還守著伊自己的約言，給弟弟做了一件新衣服，讓他在畢業的那一天穿著去和全班的同學拍了一張照。</p>
<p>弟弟也著實肯聽話，一學期除掉學·膳·宿·書費等約摸八十餘元之外，每個月往往用不到一塊錢的零用，而且畢業的名次也很前，依佩英那樣的疼他，真想再硬一硬頭皮，送他升高中。可是幾個親戚都覺得佩英自己太苦了，便勸伊趕快托人給伊弟弟薦一個生意，其中有一位舅父還剪了某某電報局招考事務生的廣告來。佩英一瞧：資格，初中畢業；年齡，十六至十九歲；待遇，月給薪資二十元；都還很適合，但是報名約期限真太侷促了，明天上午十二時就要截止了，明天偏又不是禮拜日，工廠裏請假是要扣錢的，這個佩英也就不管了，但願弟弟去報上一個名，考進了電報局，月薪二十元，一個初中畢業生也就很僥倖了。</p>
<p>為著要去報名，昨夜就決定讓他穿那件新衣服去，不料無情的天，偏又下起雨來了：佩英現在還無暇給伊弟弟擔心考取或考不取的問題，伊的注意力暫時都一起集中在那件新衣服上。「不要為著愛惜衣服，給弟弟錯掉了一個機會」。「不要弄得考既考不取，衣服又弄糟了」；這兩個不同的念頭終在伊的腦海裏交戰著，最後，伊決定還是讓弟弟穿新衣服去，因為伊知道現在的人是最重衣貌的。</p>
<p>弟弟在七點半鍾醒來，不知道他姊姊已為他轉了兩個多鍾頭的念頭了。當他們攜著雨具想走出去時，弟弟看外面的雨實在太大了，也不舍得穿這件新衣服，自己願意換一件，可是佩英卻覺得不妥，雖讓他換了一件舊的，但仍把那新的包了起來，和那畢業證書一併名著，小心翼翼地挾在伊自己的腰下，像挾著什麼珠寶一樣的鄭重。、</p>
<p>到了電報局的附近，佩英找了一條僻靜的弄堂，自己動手給弟弟換了新衣服，又把衣領和衣角再三替他拉正了，才讓他一個人走進電報局去。其時局子門前已擠著許多趕來報名的青年，佩英覺得人數是實在太多了，伊弟弟或許已報不到名了；再瞧雨是越下越密，伊又擔心弟弟的新衣服這一次要完全弄壞了。伊在那弄堂口比擬知道等候了多少時候，好容易才看見弟弟混身淋得像落湯雞似的奔回來了，不待伊問，便告訴伊報名已經報到了，立刻，笑就在伊的臉上湧了起來，但當伊的視線射到弟弟那一件滿沾著雨水和泥垢的新衣時，伊的眼淚也就簌簌地滾下來了。</p>

<h3>國府明令徵兵</h3>
<p>— 汶</p>
<p>軍政部布告，將於最近起，於豫皖贛江浙五省，試行徵兵。剴切布告民衆</p>
<p>對於這一爲國家充足實力的徵兵法，應奉行無違。中國現豐正遭逢到一個生死關頭，整個國家的生命在死神掌上跳舞。全中國每一個不是漢奸不願做漢奸的民衆，誰都願以最後的熱血，貢獻於國家，爲民族爭取最後的生存權利而流洒。在這樣一個抗敵情緒異常高漲的情形下，對於政府的徵兵命令，我想每一個國民都會予以最熱烈的擁護的。</p>
<p>政府徵兵命令，在以抗敵爲前提下，必能獲得全民衆的最熱烈的擁護。我們知道，鋼鐵被燒到熔點時，若不立卽澆鑄成某種模型，它就會立刻冷却而凝固的。再燒。再燒一次，就得把前此所消費的煤火與熔燒時間，都浪費了。兵法上也有一個最忌的部門，呌作：「師老」。師老者，不能乘其銳氣，一鼓而攻克敵人之營壘，徒然稽廷時日，使敵人得從容布置其進攻方略，而我方銳之士氣，一經頓挫，卽勇氣大减，疑異紛起，不復能再如盛銳之時，併力以向前也，這是極淺近的常識。但回過來看看我們今日民族抗戰的陣容，是否正在盛銳之時呢？請看一二八之役，全國民衆，特別是居處上海近縣的民衆，怎樣如痴如狂以全部熱情作十九路軍最有力的支援。那時我在上每附近的某縣，有一事至今不能使我忘記：有一個四十歲以上的小脚婦人，親手提了二大圓塊的上等白糖年糕（這糕看來她們平時捨不得隨便送人吃的），送到那時該縣作爲徵集慰勞品中心的「救國會」來，還說：「沒有別的東西好送，這糕是我家老太太呌我送來的」。可是我們却始終沒有到各家各戶去募捐過，也未發過一張募捐的傳單，只口頭傳出：我們在徵集犒賞十九軍慰勞品罷了。又一次，無綫電播音筒傳來（那時滬報已斷），說：各方送到十九軍的食品已太多了，吃不了，用不到再送，却希望能送幾萬雙用麻縷紮的草鞋去。該縣草鞋是不大有的，而且平時决無存積，麻紥草鞋尤難得，但在二日夜間，終於連趕帶收集到了三千雙。再看正在目前展開的全國不分上下，一致以最大的熱情擁護綏遠作戰軍士的援助運動，比之過去的援助十九路軍，又何嘗有兩樣呢？這正是無論如何不能用什麽藉口把它掩過的正當盛銳的全民族的「士氣」！</p>
<p>因此，國府明令公布徵兵法，我們全體國民應以最大的熱誠來擁護它；同時，我們尤其熱烈的擁護政府趕快結集這一正當盛銳的全民族的「士氣」，「及鋒而用」！</p>
<h3>島上</h3>
<p>— 林娜</p>
<p>這島上，只有一方里左右大小，終年罩着潮濕的霧氣。</p>
<p>當西班牙皇朝，用神父和聖經來統治這三十六島時，這兒是一個死囚犯的禁囚地。百年後，統治權換了新主，這兒仍舊是死囚犯的禁囚地。不同的，那時牧師們諄諄善導的告訴了囚犯，說他們有一個女皇陛下，而現在，沒有人告訴，們也會知道自己是羅斯福的人民。</p>
<p>在島的最高峯，聳立着一座堡壘式的宏大監牢，是一座由囚徒們自己動手造起來關禁自己的建築物。外面有成十座的瞭守台，散置着，台上　駐着白皮膚的巡守兵。托着槍把，威嚴地坐在那兒看看蔚監色的天，傾聽着海的鳴咽。</p>
<p>在堡內，巨大的機械吼聲，成天地響着，透過了高大的圍墻，播遍全個寂靜的海島，這是從四個不同的監牢工塲發出來的。囚徒們拖着鏘鏘的鐐扣，當氣笛嗚嗚鳴着的時候，便被整羣的從監房內趕出來，逐向工塲里去。在那兒，他們要勞動着，管理着吸血的機械。據說這還是平常犯才有這權利，政治犯們就連這點自由，也被剝奪的。</p>
<p>武裝的看守，和拖着輕鐵繚的工頭，不時揮動着皮鞭，在他們間奔走着，爲着一個小小的錯誤，這羣穿着無領囚衣，剃光了頭的囚徒，就要被拖出去吊着鞭打，或釘上大架關在潮濕的地下室里於是柔弱的被死亡光顧了，頑强的便又得抱住他們底傷痕，勞動着，爲着連自己也想不出的理由而勞動着。</p>
<p>當我們以記者團的資格，坐在一匹輕便的電艇上，逐　Manila海港平靜的波濤，被導向這可怕的島上時，已經是午後二時左右了。我們奔過了不少陰冷的廢場和牢房，朝發出機械聲的工塲過去。這兒是一條狹長的房間，只可以容了一百人，可是却擠上了約一百五十人，機械帶着粗笨的聲音，奔吼着，間雜以空人的熱氣和汗臭，在混濁的空間迴旋着，使人感到了沉重的昏眩。</p>
<p>囚徒們是那　熟練着自己底工作，他們用超過限度效率在工作，細心而且沉靜的，似怕做錯了，或做得趕不上人家，到那時他們很淸楚會發生了怎樣可怕的現象。</p>
<p>我們靜寂的站着，剛想移向另一邊去，忽然，大家都被一種奇異的現象吸住了。在那陰暗的一角，一個瘦削的老人昏倒了，馬上他便被拖向曠地上去，仰臥着全身發着可怕的痙攣，額角冒着汗，眼球翻白，嘴角吐着白沫。旁邊却站着一位工頭打扮，拖輕鐵扣的高大漢子，揮着手中的皮鞭，在他而上着力的抽打着，嘴里發着喃喃的呌駡聲：</p>
<p>「現在，看你還會裝死麽！」</p>
<p>這類工頭，是從囚徒中選擇出來的，他們本身被監官優待着，被允許有一根皮鞭，可以任意抽打每一個弱小的同伴，雖然他們也是囚犯，也要在這孤島里度過一生。</p>
<p>工塲里，馬上便現得緊張起來了，可是他們却不敢停頓手中的工作，跑去看一看被虐待的同伴，他們不敢喘息，也不敢發出怨恨的嘆息。我在那兒呆立着，抱着極端惡劣的心情，向每張流汗的面孔看着，我想明白着，他們底憤怒稈度。可是，我所看到的，却同樣是那絕望而且悲哀的面孔，有一個二十左右歲的小夥子，甚至嘻笑着，向我作鬼臉</p>
<p>「先生是上面派來的？」我過去，他便悄聲的問着。</p>
<p>「不是，我是新聞記者……」答着，我搖搖頭。</p>
<p>「唔……」他底手又動着了。「那麼，你能給我幾根烟嗎，」接着他又介紹了自己道。「我呌黎剎，二十二歲，馬車夫，犯殺人罪。……」</p>
<p>「你們不是也有工錢嗎？我遞給了他幾根吸剩的雪茄烟。</p>
<p>「天才曉得，他們是怎樣扣，每個月弄到手的還不到塊把錢。……」他答着，把烟藏好。</p>
<p>那老入已被抬跑了，有一陣輕脆的皮鞋聲，從另一角落響了過來，他機警地向我使着眼色，便又若無其事的動手工作去。接着，我也提起脚，望出口處移動。</p>
<p>回到家，我抱着苦痛的心情，寫下了如下的感想：「……囚徒們，都在一種血腥氣　飢餓里生活着，他們做着十四小時以上的工，被虐待而且吃着極惡劣的糧食。……」</p>
<p>第二天在顯著的地位，却改變了如下的樣子：</p>
<p>「……我們幾乎不相信，那是死囚犯底監房。在這兒，他們生活得和平常的工人沒有兩樣，他們熱誠地工作和娛樂着，據說有許多人，還把自己底工錢積蓄着，寄回家去。…」</p>
<p>我大聲的在笑着，那一張報紙就在我底手中，變成一片一片的碎片了。</p>
<h3>春園街</h3>
<p>— 時玳</p>
<p>在北平的時候我慣喜歡逛「天橋，」到「天津」又跟「三不管」結下不解之緣。這次跑到香港來，滿以爲沒有平，津那樣下層階級娛樂的會聚地可玩，不料事實把我的意測擊破，香港有個一灣仔，」地方的熱鬧並不在「天橋」和「三不管」之下　當我發現這地方時，是多麽高興啊！我不再去爬那亂石嶙嶙的「摩星嶺，」不再跑進松林和榕樹下玩味那可咚的奔泉，把每個黃昏和夜晚的時光都消磨在「灣仔」的懷抱裏。彷彿解除了覊絆似的，心頭是那麽舒暢，那麽愉快，「灣仔」的世界跟我沒有隔閡，沒有仇恨，所見所接的事物都是和靄可親，而且最爲我所瞭解。</p>
<p>「灣仔」一帶最使我感興趣的是「春園街」這兒是下層階級者娛樂的中心地點，特別是勞働者，他們從碼頭上，從工廠裏，從魚市菜塲裏，不斷的擁到「春園街」來。黃昏一到，熱鬧就加倍的澎湃。</p>
<p>窗外的街燈放光時，我就脫掉那雙整天不離脚的木展，換上橡皮底鞋便出門去。對面海上，內耀着星點燦爛的燈火，平靜的海把香港和九龍劃開，兩面的無數燈光輝耀着，好像彼此在互相誘惑。街市擾着，麻將聲充滿着各處，述急躁的電車鈴鐺都掩蓋不煞它。黃衣的印度巡捕，指揮來往的車輛，忙得滿頭是汗，稍微閒一會兒，他就拿眼去瞟街旁飯館里的盛餚盛饌。在霓紅燈照耀下，印度人和馬來人就不容易分淸楚？怎麽這殖民地上白種人那麼少呢？所見到的幾乎全是中國人，日本人，菲律濱人，馬來人，夏威夷人都是極少數，無論在街頭，在市塲，在碼頭，除却中國人只有印度人是多數的了。</p>

<p>靈樞素問</p>
<p>— 劉馨柏醫師主答</p>
<p>氣喘難過</p>
<p>第一一六號，徐家滙土山灣，施彥昌君問：敝人體質素弱，又因操勞過度，非半夜不能睡眠。有時熟睡中忽急跳而醒，一身虛汗。向左側臥時則氣喘難過，呼吸困難。友人謂恐爲心臟病，聞之手足無措。請問（一）是何病？（二）服何藥？</p>
<p>答：頗似心臟病，但心臟病有數十種，療法，預後，各不相同，但靠來函所叙，無法判明究爲何種心臟病。不得確實診斷而下藥，難保無錯誤，以致發生危險。故請先診査一次，斷定究是何病，以後服藥調養爲適。</p>
<p>夜視蒙朧</p>
<p>第一一七號。李警忠君問：家妹年方十五歲，一至下午六時以後，兩眼卽不能視物，據謂只能見糢糊之燈光，其他物雖擺在目前，亦不能見之。但一至白日，則視力又恢復。故請問：（一）是何病？（二）有無藥物可治？（三）因何而起？</p>
<p>答：（一）夜盲症。（二）營養不足及神經衰弱。（三）服『維他命A』（Vilamin－A）</p>
<p>尿道奇癢</p>
<p>第一一八號，南市迎勳路程新君問：鄙人被劣友所誘，曾作冶遊一次，越十五日後，尿道奇癢，二十日後，左股間後內發出一核，現漸漸外透。請問：（一）何病？（二）服荷藥最有效？</p>
<p>答：（一）尿道癢是尿道炎，『左股間後內』部位不明，不知是否指肛門外部。如是，則當爲痔瘡。（二）尿道炎服『淸濁便』（Citropin）痔瘡須用腐蝕法，此非自己所能辦，非請敎醫師不可。</p>
<p>陰莖不舉</p>
<p>第一一九號，白利南路三七弄一〇五號，黃天炯君問：鄙人現年三十歲，身體甚强壯，做事不知勞苦。病狀爲頭腦漲疼，心胃等處痛疼，生殖器不能舉起，舉起亦不過一二秒鐘，敝人有此病惟恐生育絕望，故請問（一）是否房事過度？（二）身體强壯何來此病，（三）何藥可治？（四）生育絕望否？</p>
<p>答：（一）房事過度能致此，但房事過度之外，原因尙多。（二）旣有頭腦漲痛，宜檢查有無脊髓病，糖尿病，及神經衰弱，此三者均爲陽萎之最大原因。心胃部痛疼須檢査心臟及胃，是否有心臟病及胃病。心臟病及胃病雖不是陽萎之原因，但到底是人體上之可厭疾病。疾病有必須衰弱之人息之者，有必須强壯之人患之者，如閣下之病，本與體之强弱無關，任何易性皆有染之可能也。（三）注射「保利多命」（Polytonin）並行電療，（四）不至。</p>
<p>肛門出血</p>
<p>第一二〇號，趙之瑛女士問：我今年不過二十二歲，起初肛門內熱痛，大便不通，兩三天始有一次，大便裏混有血液。現在症狀依然，面黃肌瘦，並且還有頭痛，呼吸困難，苦悶等，這些病狀在肛門痛得利害的時候增加，到肛門不痛就好了。請問：（一）是什麼病？（二）怎樣治療？（三）有無生命危險？（四）出血怎樣治？（五）頭痛，呼吸困難，苦悶，有無療法？</p>
<p>答：（一）是內痔核。（二）局部注射『却痔病』（Caseobin）。（三）無。（四）服「新亞鈣劑」（Sinocalcin），或用『腎上腺鹼栓藥』（Aorenalin　Suppository塞入肛門。（五）此名「痔核苦惱」，不必治療，原病治好，自然痊癒。</p>
<p>鼻孔流血</p>
<p>第一二一號，浙江路橋南堍，永茂鋼鐵號，錢產原君問：敝人前年患鼻孔流血，到現在二十二歲，已有六七年了。在去年上半年就醫某醫師前，蒙施手術浸洗，以藥水塗擦。流血時祗有一右鼻孔，翳治時當也注重右鼻孔。流血雖然好了，現在有時還是要流的，眞沒有辦法。現在敝人的右鼻孔內竟然沒有似時，透不過氣來。（一）這是什麽道理？（二）怎樣治？</p>
<p>答：（一）先診査鼻孔內有何病。（二）用棉花淺以『腎上腺鹼』（Adrenalin）塞入鼻孔。並常服『新亞鈣劑』（Sinocalcin）</p>
<p>耳朶流膿</p>
<p>第一二二號，張叔之君問：小女年方九歲，呼右耳痛，發聾，後來耳裏流出膿水，百治不癒，請問（一）是否即所謂紅耳朶？（二）有無危險？（三）請示最有效之療法。（四）科學名稱？</p>
<p>答：是，學名急性化膿性中耳炎。（二）速治，否則變爲乳嘴突起炎（耳朶後面起一大疱），或轉爲慢性，則治療維難了。（三）用過氣化氫（Hydrcgen　Peroxide）洗耳，用棉花吸乾，吹入海　仿（Haibiform）粉，數日卽癒。注射『百乃定』（Panadin）亦有大效。（四）見（一）。</p>
<p>面部紅燒</p>
<p>第一二三號，閘北永興路交通部電話局國際部，林永輝君問：鄙人每於冬季，忽而面部發紅燒，同時鼻部也紅的厲害。假如那時心裏稍覺得刺戟，則面部越熱越烈。平常一經發熱，不會立刻就好。這種情形傍晚較日間爲甚，與冬風無關。有的時候用飯時和餐後立即發燒，兩手冰冷，眼睛朦朧，精神倒還好，可是覺得難過得很。請問（一）這是什麼病？（二）由何而來？（三）應當怎樣治好？（四）可有什麼自療的法子否？</p>
<p>答：（一）顏面毛細血管充血。（二）血管神經興奮。（三）服「補美心」（Bromagsin）。（四）見（二）。</p>
<p>吞酸　氣</p>
<p>第一二四號，王大成君問：敝人腹部常有很不適服的感覺，又像被東西壓着了。有時反胃，吐酸水，吐酸臭地，喉嚨麻辣辣的痛，喫過飯兩三個鐘頭肚子要痛了，喫些東西就不痛了。所以請問：（一）是什麼病？（二）有無危險？（三）飲食？怎樣調養？（四）要不要洗胃？（五）喫什麼藥</p>
<p>答：（一）胃酸過多。（二）無，但纏綿。（三）不可以喫的東西是胡椒，辣椒，葱，薑，蒜，酒，荷蘭水，醋，檸檬，山渣，咖啡，香煙。可以喫的東西是鷄蛋，肉湯，牛奶，馬鈴薯，荳腐，和各種肉。（四）用一％重炭酸鈉水洗胃。（五）「的是開胃」（Biscama），或「雙氣鎂」（Dioxima）。</p>
<p>雜問一束</p>
<p>第一二五號，江灣翔殷路，復旦實騐中學，陳燮榮君問：敬啓者，鄙人現年十六，一一年前起患遺精，身體欠强。現有疑問幾則，務請賜答：（一）胸塞悶，略痛，患神經衰弱能否有之？（二）　中出血，而同時咳嗽亦帶血，鄙人照X光，打診，均無肺病徵，此究爲何部出血？（三）醫云。「鼻樑偏壞，而鼻塞，鼻後有痰，幷多涕」　否鼻膜炎或其他？（四）照上列症狀，且患貧血，可舉行深呼吸及冷水摩擦否？（五）夜間多夢，熱水洗足有微效否？（六）眼藥以何種爲佳？（七）貧血宜服何藥？家常蔬菜中何種有效？（八）冬天牛奶可否冷飲？隔日吃有害否？（九）因經濟國難，來源斷絕，擬赴先生處就診，可不可以酌量减費？（十）此症欲根治至少需多少時日？</p>
<p>答：（一）此是心臟病之症狀，亦能合併神經衰弱。（二）鼻出血之血液能混入痰中。（三）此句意義欠明，大概是慢性鼻黏膜炎。（四）此等療法須視身體是否適當，强行反而有害。（五）有效。（六）不知閣下患何等眼病？（七）貧血服「利凡命」（Livemin），蔬菜中蔬菜與蘿葡中均有多量鐵質，可醫貧血。（八）以溫食爲佳，免惹起胃卡他耳。牛奶是營養品，隔日多少，本無問題。（九）請來面談。（十）鼻出血，貧血，皆短時日所能愈。心臟病，鼻病，治愈須時。</p>
<p>血虧療法</p>
<p>第一二六號，愚園路一一五五號，王今君問：鄙人身體衰弱（面色蒼白，作事容易疲勞，冬日畏寒……）。前經請醫診治，斷爲血虧，請問：（一）應服食何種補血藥，及注射何種補血針？（二）市土所售之補血針，何種牌子功效最爲確實而可靠？（三）注射前是否須先騐血型？</p>
<p>答：（一）『利凡命』（Livemin）。此藥爲肝膏製劑，肝膏對於貧血之效力，歷載各種有名醫學雜誌，世界名醫師之爲文介紹者更多，無待贅叙。現今貧血之肝膏療法，已成標準療法，昔日之鐵劑，已成過去。『利凡命』有注射內服兩種，閣下可擇一使用。（二）見（一）。（三）須要騐血，但非騐血型（血型是輸血時用的），而是騐紅血球計數（Red　cell　Countng），白血球計數（White　cell　Counting），血球種類（有無小血球，多型血球，巨大血球，有鹼性色素嗜染性顆粒之紅血球……），及血色素含有量（Cocr　Index）。騐血之好處不但閣下之疾病可得一確實之診斷，又能爲治療之標準。換句話說，紅血球恢復到五百萬，血色素含有量恢復到八〇％，是不需要繼續施治的明徵。</p>
<p>踱進「春園街口」，最先映入眼幕的是街邊擺滿了一担担食物，擺担的小販都是面黃肌瘦的中國人，他們的眼請出神的注意着過路人，扯着嗓子喊呌：</p>
<p>—啞（一）個仙好大個—</p>
<p>—兩個仙一大堆……</p>
<p>兩邊騎樓下掛「通天曉」「李半仙」，「鬼谷有咁靈」等等招牌的哲學家，像受了經濟恐慌的威脅，瘋在的挽救他的垂危的命運似的，鼓動如簧之舌，高談相命神術。有時竟跟上海的雉妓差不多，動手拖人，不知道的倒被他嚇一跳。</p>
<p>口渴得很，在小担子旁喝了兩碗紅豆粥，我就去瞧搓麻雀的，一條短短的「春園街」竟有五六個「拍麻雀」的舖子！劈拍拍的聲浪充滿了全街，使你有一種如入戲塲之感。每一麻雀館子里至少有十幾檯「拍」客，多的有廿來檯！屋子那麼小，可是他們耐心的擠下去，六七十個人佔據着那些牌桌，靠背或貼到牆壁過賭癮。到這兒來參加竹戰的將士們，都是無業的流氓，苦力，小市民，他把整個的生活放在這上面，希望和幻想也放在這上面。看看他們瘦得那麼可憐，精神幾乎都耗費盡了。然而他們沒有覺醒，忘記是自己在殺害自己。</p>
<p>「麻雀館」過去便是飲冰室。凉茶舖，冷熱食品店等等，錯列其間，差不多佔去全街十分之九的地面。誰都知道廣東人是專門講究「吃」的，（這里廣東人佔百分之八十有餘）每個飯館和食品店都「座上客滿」。如果摸摸袋里還有幾個仙時，不妨進凉茶舖里去消遣，化一個仙的茶資就够了，旣可看搽胭脂抹粉的女侍，又有幾種報紙看。袋里仙多，還可花四個仙聽舞台紅伶的歌曲。有的人一盅茶坐到舖子關門時才出來。</p>
<p>走到靠近犬道的那邊，有茶樓和影戲院，花一毫仔便可進去看兩個鐘頭。</p>
<p>在街中橫連那條交加街，人人都知道那呌「爲食街」。這名稱顧名思義，便可想像到那條街是陳列着種種色色的食品，那來往的人們也多「爲食」而來的。</p>
<p>春園街！我把許多時光消耗在這里</p>
<h3>嚴七</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>初冬的細雨微風緊鎖了乾枯的樹梢的時侯，我又想起了嚴七。</p>
<p>他有一幅飽經風霜的臉，短短地小鬍子遮蓋了他那缺了口的上嘴唇，兩個眼珠子總歡喜一豎一豎地斜瞟着人。</p>
<p>他在我們住居的門口，架了一面攤子，上面陳列些極容易引誘孩子們口饞的束西，花花綠綠地一大堆，那僻靜的街頭，是不能講什麼「衛生」的，何况又是小本經營呢？任夏天的蚊蠅吮吸了每樣東西的內髓，任冬季的風沙蒙住整個的攤子上，使貨物都失去了光艷的色澤，這些，對孩子們是無效的，畢竟，那一堆一堆的，會引這饞涎的呑嚥呵！</p>
<p>——嚴七，喊他一聲，跟着看了一下他的臉色，小心的指了那玻璃盒子：再把冷粉賒兩個子兒吧！</p>
<p>——還賒？上回的賬沒還，知道麽？他的眼珠子又一豎，去，跟媽要錢來買！</p>
<p>在小心眼裏很迅速的浮上了一個念頭，「要錢」不是件容易的事。好！你敢不賒，有你的。於此，跑回去喊了幾個同院的夥伴，像小毛頭和小五也都在被邀之列，走出來，自然在聲勢上就有點兩樣，洶湧的走上去，問他到底賒不賒，這一羣小鬼起先沒有放在他的眼睛裏，他自然不便「屈服」，這樣，我們聯合起來都把嘴往上一　，仿效他的樣子，指頭劃在臉上——</p>
<p>——看唷，嘴饞偸肉被人砍了一刀，缺了口，弗！弗！</p>
<p>這缺點，他是不願意掛在孩子們的口頭，留鬍子對於這，也有相當的連繫。就利用這弱點，我們在向他進攻，爲了免去格外的張揚，結果，却能輕巧的滿足了本身的慾望。</p>
<p>時間是快的，兩個年頭像一陣風，輕輕地過去了。</p>
<p>春天了，萬物都泛濫了「生之活躍」但嚴七，却深深地鎖上愁容，憂鬱使得他的神經受了刺激，常常地把賒的賬目會相互的調錯，這情形我們知道在他的內心裏一定有無限的隱痛，但他不肯說，可是憂慮的程度却逐漸的加深了。</p>
<p>之後，在他的攤子旁邊出現了一個小孩，有五六歲的光景，喊他作爸爸。怎麽？他不是沒有家屬麼？在過去兩年裏，不管由直接或是間接也沒有聽說過他有小孩的。</p>
<p>從那時起，他的攤子就發生了問題，有時還照常的攤設，有時也能停歇好幾天。</p>
<p>是深秋的一個夜晚，攤子上燃着美孚行的火油燈，光芒從玻璃罩子分射到各方，怪幽暗的，伴了落寞的街頭，更顯得有一種凄淸之感。一個三十來歲的女人坐在攤邊，顏色挺難看的，仙們間有一團不能接近的殺肅的空氣。</p>
<p>跟着，他有十多天沒有擺攤子，這孩子們的債主不時的引起莫名的牽掛。初冬的厲風橫掃着大地上的殘葉細雨把泥土的街面合成了泥粥，上燈以後，傅說在南下窪子砍傷了一個人，據說傷的入就是擺小攤的嚴七，傷得很兇，性命怕都要發生危險。</p>
<p>爲點什麽呢？不知道，有的說情殺，有的說復仇，也有的歸之於命運！</p>
<p>從此，街頭再不看見他的攤子，呵，我們還欠了他一些零星的賬欵呢！乾枯的樹梢又被初冬的風雨緊鎖着，於是、，我又想起嚴七，然而，已經有八個年頭了。</p>

<h3>Within 60 Li Around Bailing Temple, Remnants of Bandits and Puppets Have Been Completely Cleared Out. The Counter-Attack Plan Failed Miserably; Bandits Retreat to the Big Temple for Reorganization. Certain Side’s Heavy Artillery Fiercely Bombards Our Mountain Top Positions. Bandit Planes Rampage; National Army Planes Prepare to Engage.</h3>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) On the evening of the 3rd, a certain regular infantry force of 2,000, arrived at the temple from Dolun, including over 200 artillerymen, more than a dozen large and small cannons, and a machine gun squad of more than ten guns. There are reports that they will immediately open the front line to Suidong Taolin. At the same time, a large batch of military supplies such as grain, ammunition, etc. arrived on sixty trucks. The ammunition boxes were all printed with the names of a certain country and puppet state manufacturing plants. On the 3rd, 2,000 Rehe troops arrived near Bailing Temple to assist the bandits in counter-attacking. Currently, there are more than 8,000 bandit Mongolian troops in Xila Mulengtai, mostly cavalry, stationed in Nanhangqian. Zhang Wanqing has received puppet orders to attack Xinghe immediately after the Rehe reinforcements arrive. From the morning of the 4th to 4:00 PM, over twenty trucks transported gasoline, etc. from Zhangbei to Shangdu Jiaxia Temple. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) On the morning of the 3rd, after the puppet bandit army's counter-attack on Bailing Temple failed, the bandits re-invaded at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, with many planes providing cover and dropping many bombs. On the afternoon of the 3rd, the bandits attacked the temple six or seven times, but were all repelled by our army. The number of bandit deaths was over 500. There was a strong blizzard on the night of the 3rd. Captured bandits confessed that they had not eaten for two days and nights. The bandit army's morale was low, and they surrendered in droves. On the morning of the 4th, the bandits launched another dawn attack on the temple. Our army met the attack and fought fiercely for several hours. At 10:00 AM on the morning of the 4th, our army bravely launched an attack, and the bandits could not withstand it and scattered in different directions. At that time, planes provided cover, and cars carried the bandits as they fled in disarray, with casualties everywhere. They surrendered in droves, and our army treated them kindly and accommodated them. The remaining defeated soldiers are also being separately taken care of. From the afternoon of the 4th onwards, there were no traces of bandits within 60 li around Bailing Temple. The bandit army's plan to counter-attack Bailing Temple has completely failed. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining dispatch: Over a thousand puppet army cavalry were discovered in the Hongfangzi Beihou area within Wuchuan territory, attempting to cut off our connection to Bailing Temple. At the same time, over a thousand infantry surrounded our Guandi Temple garrison. Our Sun Changsheng Division is engaging them separately. The bandits are using armored vehicles as a weapon, and there are also planes providing cover. The battle situation is extremely urgent. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining dispatch: According to reports from here, enemy planes continued to bomb Bailing Temple in large numbers on the morning of the 4th and dropped bombs on Nanxiang Village. The number of bandits and puppets in the Big Temple continued to increase on the 3rd and 4th nights. The Rehe 1st Division Regiment [missing text] army, about one regiment, has been replaced with puppet Manchukuo troops, and many cannons have been transported and arranged to fiercely bombard our mountain top positions, attempting to destroy our positions. The sound of cannons continued from the night of the 3rd to the morning of the 4th. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Suidong remained quiet until the 4th. After Fu Zuoyi arrived in Jining on the evening of the 2nd and gave instructions to the garrison officers and soldiers, the defenses became even more consolidated. Fu returned to Sui from Jining on the morning of the 3rd and is currently intensifying the bandit suppression work in Sueibei. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Zhang Xuanze, a counselor from the Bandit Suppression Headquarters, returned to Sui on the 4th after inspecting the Suidong front. According to reports, the morale of the troops on the Suidong front is extremely high, and the defenses are absolutely consolidated. Commercial vehicles between Shangdu and Jining are still operating, and the local area is peaceful. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining dispatch: The main force of the bandit army attacking Bailing Temple this time is a part of the Rehe [missing text] Army's [missing text] Division, accompanied by the puppet Rehe armies of Zhang Junzhe, Wang Jingxiu, and Peng Jinsheng, commanded by the [missing text] Brigade Commander of the [missing text] Division. Machine guns were used to supervise the battle from behind the lines, and those who retreated were killed. Therefore, the puppet army was extremely stubborn. Our army, commanded by Brigade Commander Sun Lanfeng, occupied advantageous terrain, and the soldiers responded calmly. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Fu Zuoyi issued a brief announcement on the 4th, stating that we are fully prepared for defending against bandit troubles in Suidong and Sueibei, and our troop strength is also sufficient. There is absolutely no problem with the security of the entire province. We hope that the people will live in peace and not easily believe rumors and be disturbed. We will also establish regulations for requisitioning vehicles and mules and purchasing fodder, so that the people will not suffer losses, and strictly prohibit officials from disturbing the people. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Wang Jingguo from Baotou and Zhao Chengzhou from Jining arrived in Sui on the 4th to meet Fu Zuoyi to discuss military affairs. Fu hosted a banquet for Wang and Zhao on the evening of the 4th. Wang immediately went to Bing to meet with Yan. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Guihua dispatch: After the Mongolian puppet bandits led by Jiang Chen launched a counter-attack on Bailing Temple from the west of the Big Temple and were defeated by the National Army, they still occupied the area around the Big Temple on the 4th, reorganizing their remnants and attempting to resist stubbornly again. On the morning of the 4th, a certain side dispatched a part of the heavy artillery regiment from Pangjiang to the Big Temple, totaling 300 people, accompanied by many military trucks carrying many military supplies. Aircraft from a certain side are continuously increasing, reaching more than 20 planes, planning to use air power to destroy our defense works and use infantry and cavalry as the vanguard to disturb Bailing Temple. The Mongolian bandit leader Bao Yueqing flew to the Big Temple on the morning of the 4th to command military affairs. This morning, four aircraft from a certain side scouted and dropped more than ten bombs over Suidong, Taolin, and Xinghe, and then flew away. National Army planes are ready to engage. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wang Ying Bandit Troops Attempt to Invade Sueixi</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to sources, as a result of active replenishment by a certain side, the remnant bandit troops were reinforced from Damiaozi, 40 li away from Bailing Temple, some time ago. The transportation was handled by the Dabe, Wenlin, and Donglu automobile companies operated by a certain side. The bandits transported to the Damiaozi area, in addition to machine guns and artillery teams, also included only about 4,000 cavalry and infantry. They started attacking our positions on the morning of the 3rd, with planes dropping bombs to assist, but were ultimately bravely repelled by the National Army. Although Wang Ying bandit troops have recently stated that they will attack Suidong, they actually still want to invade Sueixi's old nest. According to those who recently came from Bailing Temple, the bandits have lost their elite troops after suffering two defeats and are now at the end of their strength. Although they are now launching a full-scale attack, it is actually a reluctant move to obey orders. After another painful blow by the National Army, their complete collapse is just around the corner. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a well-informed Chinese source, "Manchu" and Mongolian mixed troops, numbering 5,000, attacked Bailing Temple yesterday morning under the cover of ten planes and a heavy artillery barrage. After five hours of fierce fighting, they were finally repelled by the defending troops. Two hundred people were captured. Yesterday afternoon, the "Manchu" and Mongolian mixed troops launched another attack, but were still driven away. When the two sides made contact, planes dropped many bombs, but the damage was minimal. According to Chinese newspapers, the attacking Mongolian and "Manchu" troops were led by officers wearing "woolen uniforms," presumably referring to Japanese. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Zhang Arrives in Shanghai This Morning</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Zhang took the night express train to Shanghai on the evening of the 4th, reportedly to attend Duan Zhizhiquan's funeral and visit Huang Fu, who is ill. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Three-Minister Summit Discusses China Policy; Rumor is They will Demand A Definite Reply from Us; Also Claiming to Take Self-Defense Measures; Shigeru Kawagoe Arrives in Shanghai This Morning for Rest</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to well-informed sources, as a result of today's meeting of representatives from the Foreign, Navy, and Army Ministries, Japan will demand that the Chinese government give a definite reply to Ambassador Kawagoe's note to Foreign Minister Zhang Qun yesterday afternoon. This note has been rejected and returned to the Japanese Embassy by Foreign Minister Zhang. Today's meeting of representatives from the three ministries also decided that if Sino-Japanese negotiations break down, Japan will take appropriate self-defense measures. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The sudden meeting between Foreign Minister Zhang and Ambassador Kawagoe on the evening of the 3rd and the lengthy statement issued by the Japanese Embassy in Nanjing have caused some surprise here. Although the Nanjing and Shanghai dispatches of various Japanese newspapers all contain the impression that Sino-Japanese negotiations have actually failed since the meeting between Ambassador Kawagoe and Foreign Minister Zhang on the evening of the 3rd, according to the Domei News Agency, if Japanese Consul General Suma stationed in Nanjing and Director Gao of our Asian Department can once again exchange opinions to their satisfaction on the 4th, it is expected that Sino-Japanese negotiations may achieve some conclusions. A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated this morning that he did not believe that the Nanjing talks had failed. Whether to order Ambassador Kawagoe to remain in Nanjing depends on Ambassador Kawagoe's official report on his meeting with Foreign Minister Zhang on the 3rd, which has not yet been received. Asked about the motive for the Japanese Navy and Marine Corps landing in Qingdao to search local institutions, the spokesman said that this action was a defensive measure to deal with labor unrest and defended the reason why Japan did not resort to normal diplomatic policies, saying that the time was urgent and there was no time to do so. Asked whether Japan recognizes that the Anyuan Incident would not affect Sino-Japanese negotiations, the spokesman said that the Suiyuan Incident has greatly strengthened Chairman Chiang's position and directly admitted that it has had an adverse impact on Sino-Japanese negotiations. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Embassy Secretary Suma visited the Foreign Ministry at 4:30 PM on the afternoon of the 4th to meet with Foreign Minister Chen Jie for an hour and a half, reportedly to discuss the issue of the location of the Japanese Embassy. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Pengsheng, Counselor of the Embassy in Japan, has visited various officials of the Foreign Ministry for several days after arriving in Nanjing, reporting on everything. It is reported that Wang will take a plane to Luoyang on the 5th to meet with President Jiang and report on embassy affairs in Japan. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ambassador Kawagoe will go to Shanghai by train early in the morning on the 5th. According to a spokesman for the embassy, Kawagoe has been in Nanjing for a long time, and this trip to Shanghai is for a short rest. Shimizu and others will also go to Shanghai with him. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ambassador Kawagoe invited Suma, Amemiya, Tajiri, Nakahara, and other heads of the Foreign, Army, and Navy stationed in Nanjing to report on the content of the meeting with Zhang Qun on the evening of the 3rd and discuss the policy of continuing talks between Suma and Gao Zongwu. Because the Japanese side believes that the formal negotiations have ended, Ambassador Kawagoe plans to leave Nanjing within a few days. (4th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The meeting between Consul General Suma and Director Gao of the Asian Department will not be held today at the request of the Chinese side and will be postponed until tomorrow or later. (4th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Arita visited Prime Minister Hirota again at the Prime Minister's residence on the afternoon of the 4th to report in detail on the results of the Three-Ministry Conference and continue to exchange important opinions. (4th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhang Zizhong Returns to Tianjin to Maintain Security</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Zizhong returned to Tianjin from Beiping at 6:00 PM to maintain the security of Tianjin. It is scheduled to convene a meeting of various bureau directors on the 5th to discuss a solution. Cheng Xixian went to Beiping on the 4th to meet with Song, and then took office as the commander of the First Brigade of the Hebei Provincial Security Forces. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Zizhong came to Beiping to meet with Zhu Ziyuan to discuss the security of Beiping, Tianjin, and the Chahar Province, and to ask for instructions on Tianjin's municipal affairs. Now that things have been completed, he returned to Tianjin at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Cheng Xixian arrived in Beiping on the morning of the 4th and met with Song in the afternoon to report on the handover process. Cheng will be responsible for training the Hebei Security Brigade. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen Speaks on Developing Hainan Island</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) Song Ziwen delivered a speech at the welcoming rally in Wenchang on the 3rd. The original text is as follows: Chairman, elders, brothers, and sisters, although I am from Hainan Island, I have never returned to my hometown. Today, arriving in Wenchang and meeting with all of you fellow villagers is truly the most joyful thing in my life. At the same time, I hold infinite hope for my hometown. This visit to Hainan Island is not just a tour of my homeland; it is with Commander-in-Chief Yu, Vice Minister Zeng, Commander Chen, Director Song, and other officials to Hainan Island, all embracing the implementation of the late Premier's instructions on national defense and economic construction. Since the Premier advocated the development of Hainan Island, countless people have continued to propose it, believing that Hainan Island has endowed resources and that the people of Hainan Island have the most courage. They can develop their own hometown, but until now, it has not been realized. Speaking of this, I have a feeling: hundreds of thousands of Hainanese people travel far overseas, and the money they earn from their hard work is continuously remitted back to the motherland, which shows that they do have the ability. In particular, they have recovered a lot of leakage for the country in terms of trade deficits, which is extremely admirable and praiseworthy. However, the reason why they develop outward despite the long distance is that they are oppressed by the environment and the economy at home and have to endure hardships and travel across the ocean to seek a way out in foreign lands among foreign races. We Hainanese people are very similar to the Irish in Europe. There is no place for them to live in their hometowns, and they can only exchange blood and sweat for food and clothing abroad. This kind of perseverance to fight and take risks instead of sitting still and waiting for death is the true courage of the Hainanese people. Since Hainan Island is endowed with natural resources and possesses a nation with perseverance, why has it not been developed until now? In my observation, there are three major obstacles. The first obstacle is the issue of public security. Since the Republic of China, Hainan Island has been ravaged by Long Jiguang, Deng Benyin, and the Communist Party, and the subsequent Guangdong authorities have paid no attention to Hainan Island as if it were a remote foreign land. Whenever there was trouble on the mainland, they would transfer all the garrison troops away, and they did not carefully select honest and capable officials in politics, which resulted in bandits everywhere and people living in misery for several years. Well-to-do overseas Chinese naturally did not dare to return home, and poor villagers had no choice but to migrate abroad. Now, everyone has admitted that Hainan Island is an important area in terms of national defense. The purpose of Commander-in-Chief Yu stationing a large army is not only for local public security but also for the needs of national defense. I firmly believe that no matter what happens in the future, there will be sufficient military force to protect the local area so that everyone can live and work in peace. This is something I can tell the elders. The second obstacle is the political issue. In recent years, domestic politics has been bad, as everyone knows, and there is nothing to hide. Our Hainan Island is isolated in the sea, and the officials governing the county are like the saying goes, "The sky is high and the emperor is far away," and they carry out tyrannical politics and arbitrary exploitation. The people of the countryside suffer from the devastation of bad politics even more than their compatriots on the mainland. Today, Commander-in-Chief Yu and all the military and civilian officials have come to our hometown, and Director Song also has the mission of Minister Kong, all for the purpose of seeing the suffering of the people and seeking welfare for our villages. It has been decided to abolish the salt monopoly and continue to eliminate all kinds of exorbitant taxes. Commissioner Huang is a local administrative official with rich experience and new knowledge. He has had the greatest enthusiasm for the development of Hainan Island for more than ten years. I firmly believe that he will be able to implement the various plans of the central and local military and political officials to purify officialdom and eliminate corrupt practices. The third obstacle is the transportation issue. We know that the biggest key to developing any region is to solve the transportation problem first. There is no seaport construction along the coast of Hainan Island, and there is no railway transportation in the hinterland. This time, Commander-in-Chief Yu, Railway Minister Zeng, Director Song, Commissioner Huang, and I have discussed several times and have established basic transportation plans. Moreover, the development of Hainan Island has a major connection with national defense and economy. Using the financial resources of various provinces to help complete the transportation plan will definitely be possible. Based on the above, the three major obstacles to the development of Hainan Island can be removed by some means. The so-called favorable weather, geographical advantages, and harmony among the people have all come together. My fellow villagers can rely on their own efforts to work hard for their hometown and for the party and the country, without having to work for others and develop in foreign lands. And my overseas Chinese can use their capital and experience to come back and serve their hometown. Today, I am honored to be invited by the conference. I was originally scheduled to arrive at two o'clock, but I was delayed along the way, and it was too late to arrive in Wenchang. I am very sorry for making you fellow villagers wait so hard. The reason for the delay was that I took a plane around the island and flew over the Wuzhi Mountain to observe the situation, which took more time. But this made me think of the past when I wanted to circle the island and climb the Wuzhi Mountain, which could not be completed in one or two months. Today, it can be achieved in three hours. This proves that what could not be done in the past can now be done, and what was very difficult in the past is now easy. This is the most accurate and best metaphor for the development of Hainan Island. I believe that under the leadership of the central government, Commander-in-Chief Yu, Chairman Huang, and other officials, with the help of the national economic strength, and with the courage of my millions of fellow villagers who have developed Southeast Asia, transferred to their hometown, and working together, the results in the next three to five years will definitely exceed the progress of the previous thirty to fifty years. I also believe that we can realize the late Premier's instructions on developing Hainan Island in the shortest possible time. I am a part of Hainan Island. Although I had the desire to develop it in the past, it was only based on an ideal. Today, when I actually arrived in my hometown, I felt infinite emotion in my mind. Under the guidance of implementing the late Premier's instructions and in the desire of the fellow villagers returning to Hainan Island and the compatriots of the whole country, I will devote all my efforts at any time and place to follow everyone to achieve success.

<h3>Legislative Yuan Meeting Passes the Organizational Law of the Department of Health, The Proposal to Add a Deputy Director-General Fails to Pass</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its eighty-second meeting on the morning of the 4th, with 69 members including Wang Kunlun present. Sun Ke presided as Chairman, with Liang Han Cao as Secretary-General. The agenda included: (1) The proposal that labor creditors should have the highest priority of repayment. Resolution: Passed according to the review report of the Civil Law Committee, and the case was handed over to the Labor Law Committee to add provisions when drafting the Labor Contract Law. (2) Amendment to the Organizational Law of the Department of Health. Resolution: Passed with amendments according to the review report of the Legal Affairs Committee. (3) Amendment to the Chinese Medicine Ordinance. Resolution: Passed with amendments according to the review report of the Legal Affairs Committee. (4) The Labor Law Committee reported on the drafting of the Labor Contract Law. Due to time constraints, only the second reading was passed. Chapter 1 of the law, General Provisions, consisted of seven articles. The original provision in the General Provisions chapter, "If a wife's labor for others is detrimental to the interests of her family, the husband may revoke it," was deleted according to the motion of Lin Gengbai, Wei Tingsheng, Chen Changheng, etc., to prevent the husband's rights from being higher than the wife's and to maintain gender equality. The other four chapters on the obligations of laborers, the obligations of employers, the termination of labor contracts, penalties, and supplementary provisions were left for discussion at the next Yuan meeting. In addition, the amended Organizational Law of the Department of Health has 13 articles. The main points of the amendment are to add a seaport quarantine office within the department to take over all the functions and powers of the abolished seaport quarantine administration, and to establish a Chinese Medicine Committee within the department with one director and five to nine members appointed by the Department of Health from those with knowledge of Chinese medicine. When the Yuan meeting discussed the case, Peng Yangguang, Liu Tong, Lu Zhiyi, and others advocated adding a deputy director-general to the department to position Chinese medicine talents and promote the integration of Chinese and Western medicine. Some legislators strongly opposed it, which led to a debate about the merits of Chinese and Western medicine. After a vote, only eight people agreed, and it was not passed. Later, when the name and functions of the newly established agency for managing Chinese medicine in the department were discussed, the committee members had disputes again. Later, according to the chairman's motion, the name of the agency was changed to the Chinese Medicine Committee, and its functions were changed to handle matters related to Chinese medicine. The main point of the amended Chinese Medicine Ordinance is to change the agency that reviews the qualifications of Chinese medicine practitioners from the original "Ministry of Interior" to the "Chinese Medicine Committee of the Department of Health."

<h3>Preparatory Committee of the National Goods Joint Venture Company Holds Inaugural Meeting, Wu Dingchang Presides and Delivers Opening Remarks</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Preparatory Committee of the National Goods Joint Venture Company held its inaugural meeting at the Ministry of Industry at 3 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. More than ten people including Weng Wenhao, Wu Dingchang, Zhou Zhichun, Wang Xiaolai, Liu Hongsheng, Hu Xiyuan, Fang Yexian, Qian Xinzhi, Huang Yanpei, Wang Xingyao, and Pan Yangyao attended. Wu Dingchang presided and delivered the opening remarks. He first stated that Chairman Jiang believes that the National Economic Movement is the new life of the Chinese nation and his lifelong career. Therefore, in addition to being involved in politics and military affairs, the Chairman still devotes most of his energy and time to economic construction and strives for progress. Even during his inspection tours in various provinces, he continuously telegraphed to urge us, which made us very excited and dared not to slack off. He hoped that the gentlemen in the industrial and commercial circles and the financial circles would understand the Chairman's good intentions and work together to help the General Economic Construction Association. He then stated the significance of the General Economic Construction Association's advocacy of establishing a National Goods Joint Transportation Company and explained two points: (1) The purpose of the government in organizing this company is to seek benefits for national goods throughout the country, not to develop national goods in one place. Its nature is very universal. In terms of categories, it includes machine-woven products, handicrafts, and local products. (2) In terms of machine-made products, it is not limited to machine-woven products in Shanghai. Machine-woven products from all over the country are also being collected. Therefore, its source is not limited to products from a certain place, nor is it specifically for the development of any factory or company. Therefore, the government has four key points when initiating the National Goods Joint Venture Company, which it hopes will be noted: A. When the company raises capital, all national goods companies and factories across the country will be given the same opportunity to invest so that they can participate. Therefore, the method of publicly soliciting funds is adopted. When the shares needed by the company and factory are insufficient to control, the government can transfer them. The government intends to promote and will never compete with the people for profits. B. After the National Goods Joint Venture Company is established, no matter where or which factory produces the goods, as long as the goods are fairly determined by the government agency to be needed by the people, they will have the opportunity to wholesale and sell within the company's scope. The same treatment will be given to national handicrafts and local products. C. The identification of all national goods must be accurate, and the price of the goods must be fair. The government will strictly supervise these two points to prevent consumers from being deceived. D. Department stores or vendors outside the scope of the joint venture company will be allowed to sell national goods by the National Goods Joint Venture Company at wholesale prices, and they will never be deprived of the opportunity to sell. The establishment of this company is to systematically promote the sales of national goods and has no intention of monopolizing the market. The government will never allow it to become a monopolistic business. Finally, he hoped that all national goods factories, national goods companies, and other people in the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors would help with the progress with the spirit of seeking the public good for the benefit of the masses and sacrificing individual private interests. After Wu finished his opening remarks, he continued to report on the purpose and process of the preparatory work. Subsequently, Wang Xiaolai, Huang Yanpei, Wu Yun, Chu, and Zhang Yiou successively delivered speeches, contributing many opinions on the preparatory matters. Finally, Wu Dingchang delivered a speech, hoping that the committee members would provide more comments so that the company could be prepared perfectly and the business could develop rapidly. The meeting adjourned at 5 PM. In the evening, Wu Dingchang hosted a banquet for all the attendees. The atmosphere was extremely pleasant, and they dispersed. In addition, fifty factories including the Family Industry Cooperative sent representatives such as Li Xinpu to petition the Ministry of Industry to expand the organization of the National Goods Joint Venture Company to popularize it. It is said that the result was very satisfactory. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<h3>Central Government Unifies Foreign Affairs Authority, and Three Methods of Joint Ventures Between China and Foreign Countries, The National Government Reissues Orders to the Executive Yuan to Instruct Compliance</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government instructed the Executive Yuan on the 4th: In order to comply with the matter, according to the decision of the 171st meeting of the Central Political Conference on January 16 of the 18th year, all foreign affairs negotiations by the provinces should be handled by the central government. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should notify both China and foreign countries that no matter what agreement is signed between any country and the provincial officials, the central government cannot recognize its validity. On April 9 of the 19th year, the 222nd meeting of the Central Political Conference also discussed three methods for utilizing foreign capital: (1) Investment method, (2) Franchise method, (3) Loan method. The central government has already made clear regulations on unifying foreign affairs authority and methods for joint ventures between China and foreign countries, and officials of all provinces and cities should abide by them. Recently, there have been discussions about foreign affairs events and joint ventures between China and foreign countries in various provinces and cities. The 26th meeting of the Central Political Committee on November 19 of this year decided to reissue the previous order. Therefore, it is hereby reissued that all foreign affairs negotiations by provinces and cities and clauses on joint ventures with foreigners are invalid unless approved by the central government. It is instructed to comply in order to show solemnity and maintain national rights. This order. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 4th)</p>

<h3>Manager of Xuchang Tobacco Company Assassinated</h3>
<p>(Hankou) A telegram received here today states that Mr. Newson, an American and advisor to the Nanjing government, as well as the manager of the government-run Xuchang Tobacco Company, was assassinated in Xuchang, Henan Province, by an unknown assailant. Mr. Newson was a native of Salisbury, North Carolina, USA, and was 40 years old. His wife and 11-year-old daughter are currently in Hankou. Yesterday, the first telegram only mentioned that Mr. Newson was seriously injured in the assassination. A certain famous doctor here and the manager of the British American Tobacco Company immediately prepared to take the plane borrowed from Mr. Zhang Xueliang to Xuchang this morning. However, before they could depart, the tragic news of Mr. Newson's death had already reached here.

At the same time, the US Consulate is investigating the case. Mr. Newson's mother is currently in her hometown. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)</p>

<h3>Audience with Mongolian and Tibetan Political and Religious Leaders Postponed</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission originally planned to summon Mongolian and Tibetan political and religious leaders to Beijing on the 20th of this month to facilitate communication between the central government and the border areas. However, this move has now been decided to be postponed to next year. According to the person in charge of the commission, the reason for the postponement is that those who were summoned to Beijing this time included dozens of League and Banner leaders and religious leaders from Suiyuan and Qinghai provinces. Currently, banditry is rampant in Suiyuan Province, and the League and Banner leaders are responsible for maintaining local security and protecting their territory. Therefore, they cannot spare the time. Moreover, the date of the audience is relatively hurried, and some remote provinces may not be able to arrive in time. Therefore, due to these various practical difficulties, it has been decided to postpone it to next year, and the exact date has not been determined. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 4th)</p>

<h3>The Seriousness of the Qingdao Incident</h3>
<p>— All</p>
<p>At a time when the beacons of war on the border were urgently signaling danger, the scenic city of Qingdao unexpectedly stirred up unwarranted storms. Over a thousand Japanese naval landing troops, fully armed, disembarked and densely deployed to various positions, surrounding Party and police institutions, searching for books and documents, and even beating and insulting staff, and indiscriminately arresting people. They cut off communication lines and acted with unrestrained impunity. Although those arrested were soon released, groups of Japanese soldiers remained in the city, carrying out patrol duties. Such excessive behavior by the military of a friendly nation is not only shocking to the people of our country, but also astonishing to the world. The future course of events is difficult to predict, and the increasingly fragile friendship between China and Japan has once again suffered an unexpected blow, creating an even more tense situation. This is an undeniable fact clearly evident at present.</p>
<p>The root of this incident lies in the Japanese side using the pretext of worsening labor unrest to take decisive measures. However, according to the facts, the opposite is true. It is found that there are nine textile factories established by Japanese merchants in Qingdao. Recently, workers at three factories, including Dakang, engaged in slowdowns to demand wage increases. After repeated mediation by local government officials, there was a possibility of calming the situation. However, the factory owners suddenly convened a meeting the day before yesterday and unanimously decided to shut down all factories. Even the six factories that did not participate in the slowdown, such as Gongda Cang Kou, were also completely closed. On one hand, 30,000 laborers were suddenly thrown into unemployment, while on the other, warships were dispatched and troops were sent, deliberately creating panic. Everyone knows what Ma Zhao is up to. Otherwise, with the trivial matter of labor disputes, a common occurrence in society, it would not be difficult to achieve peace if sincerity were shown. Why engage in suspicion and speculation, turning it into an unresolvable situation? Even if, as the Japanese side claims, they feel unable to manage the businesses, they still have appropriate steps to take and the need to respond separately. Why close down all six factories that did not participate in the labor unrest? And why resort to illegal military means to create an unfathomable situation? Foreign dispatches claim that the arrival of Japanese military officer Major Yazaki in Qingdao is related to this military action. Understanding the truth, one can see the implications of this.</p>
<p>Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie protested to the Japanese consul after the incident occurred, and Foreign Minister Zhang Qun also raised three demands when meeting with Ambassador Kawagoe. The progress of subsequent negotiations is being watched by the general public. One point we must especially emphasize is that in our own territory, we are suddenly subjected to the trampling of foreign troops; the Party headquarters, the repository of our dignity, is subjected to encirclement and search by foreign soldiers; and the leaders of our respected institutions are subjected to unwarranted and illegal arrest. What then is the meaning of national sovereignty? Even if the negotiations result in the withdrawal of Japanese troops and the return of documents, how can we tolerate and gloss over this act of infringing upon our sovereignty? After the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs repeatedly stated the determination to defend territorial sovereignty, this blatant act of infringing upon our sovereignty occurred. The grief and indignation of the authorities are self-evident. In order to implement their claims, what means will they use to exert their greatest efforts?</p>
<h3>British King Fights for Freedom of Marriage: Prefers to Sacrifice the Throne for Love Rather Than Compromise; Various Parties Plead to Change His Mind; Mrs. Simpson Quietly Leaves England for France</h3>
<p>(London) According to the Daily Mail, despite the entreaties of the cabinet and autonomous governments, the British King remains unmoved. The King insists that this matter is difficult to compromise. If he decides to abdicate, he will announce it to Parliament. The Daily Mail also learned that the King's lover, Mrs. Simpson, plans to travel to Paris this morning on the King's private plane. (December 4th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The cabinet convened a special meeting of the House of Commons today to discuss King Edward VIII's marriage to Mrs. Simpson. However, both the government and the public have effectively given up hope of dissuading Edward from abdicating. At 9:00 this morning, the King returned to London from Belverdere Fortress, but at the same time, a truck loaded with luggage departed from the fortress. (December 4th, Guomin News)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the wedding issue, well-informed sources recently stated that after the King discussed the matter with Queen Mary, his brothers the Duke of York, the Duke of Gloucester, and the Duke of Kent yesterday, he is now considering a compromise that would prevent the abdication from occurring. (December 4th, Havas News)</p>
<p>(London) King Edward VIII, after conferring with Queen Mary, his brothers the Duke of York, and Prime Minister Baldwin yesterday, abdication is inevitable unless there are unexpected changes. Regarding this matter, political figures recently stated that the King's decision will be announced in Parliament next Monday. Therefore, the King theoretically has three days to carefully consider and change his mind. Some members of Parliament also hope that the King can cancel his original decision. However, semi-official sources believe that the King has already made up his mind and does not intend to change it, and the abdication could be announced today, but it is delayed because the succession issue has not been completely resolved. Well-informed sources also stated that the courtiers originally hoped that the King could change his mind after Queen Mary's earnest persuasion, but the King, due to the scandalous private affairs causing public uproar and damaging the dignity of the monarch, has already decided to abdicate, and he made this clear when he met with Prime Minister Baldwin. (December 4th, Havas News)</p>
<p>(London) It was learned from reliable sources today that if the government does not compromise on King Edward's marriage, Edward has decided to abdicate within 48 hours. Although this news has not been confirmed, Edward spoke briefly with the Duke of York at Buckingham Palace at 8:00 this evening, and then together they went to Marlborough House to visit Queen Mary. It is said that the King plans to meet with the cabinet and the Privy Council tomorrow to announce his final decision. It is reported that Prime Minister Baldwin informed the King that if Mrs. Simpson does not leave England, the cabinet will resign. The King was furious upon hearing this and made the decision to abdicate. It was later learned that Mrs. Simpson may depart for France, and Edward may also abdicate to follow her. Baldwin also told the King that he has the support of the Labor Party and that if the King does not heed the cabinet's advice, he will not be able to form a government. (December 3rd, Guomin News)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is learned here that Mrs. Simpson arrived in Rouen from London at 3:30 this morning and then came to Paris before 11:30. It is said that Mrs. Simpson will go to Versailles to visit an American friend. (December 4th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) Mrs. Simpson arrived at the Petit Trianon in Versailles this afternoon. When Mrs. Simpson left Dieppe at 2:50 this morning, she was accompanied by several plainclothes detectives. (December 4th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Announces No Intention to Create Legislation: Obtains the Consent of the Entire Federation; There Is No Precedent for Unequal Marriage</h3>
<p>(London) This afternoon, British Prime Minister Baldwin announced in the House of Commons that the government is not prepared to introduce legislation to facilitate the marriage proposed by the British King. The issue currently being discussed is a matter of common concern to the entire federation. Without the consent of all autonomous dominions, this change cannot take effect. Baldwin also stated that he was very satisfied with the results of his inquiries to all parties because there was no indication of consent to this matter. Baldwin added, "I feel it is very appropriate to make this statement before adjourning today, because this can dispel misunderstandings. I have no other comments to make at this time." Baldwin also replied to a question from Labor opposition leader Attlee, stating that some newspapers have argued that if the British King insists on marrying Mrs. Simpson, her title does not necessarily have to be Queen. This concept has no constitutional basis whatsoever. There is no precedent in British law for such an unequal marriage. The Royal Marriages Act of 1772 does not apply to the British King himself, but only stipulates that the marriages of other members of the royal family are not valid without the King's permission. This law has nothing to do with the current matter. The British King does not need to obtain the permission of any other authority, but the woman he marries must nominally be called Queen. The only way to avoid this outcome is to create a separate law for this special event, but the government is not prepared to propose this method. And if there is to be any reform, it must take effect after the autonomous dominions agree. Baldwin finished speaking and then adjourned the meeting. (December 4th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Discussions in the Palace: Queen Mother Reveals Unhappiness; Brothers Also Offer Advice</h3>
<p>(London) The Duke of York, the heir to the throne, turned back on his way to Edinburgh and arrived in London yesterday morning, visiting the Queen Mother and having dinner with her, accompanied by his wife. The Duke of York, his younger brother the Duke of Kent, and his uncle Earl of Athlone all canceled all public appointments yesterday.</p>
<p>Last night, after the British King visited the Queen Mother and returned to Buckingham Palace, the Duke of York came to visit, and the brothers had a long talk. At 1:30 this morning, the British King went to Belverdere Fortress and planned to return to London before noon. Before leaving, the Prime Minister conferred with the Department of Autonomous Dominions and then entered the palace to pay his respects. The Prime Minister spent the whole day advising and, after leaving the palace, returned to his residence on Downing Street to rest. Queen Mary took time yesterday to take a car to Sidingham to see the ruins of the burned-down Crystal Palace.</p>
<p>(London) It is reported that Queen Mary has directly or indirectly expressed to the King her disapproval of his relationship with Mrs. Simpson. The Duke of York also offered much advice when he visited the Queen Mother today. The King earnestly pleaded with the Queen Mother, but she was very displeased at the time. (December 3rd, Guomin News)</p>
<p>(London) After the King visited the Queen Mother with the Duke of York today, he returned to Buckingham Palace. It is rumored that the Queen Mother and Princess Mary wept together after the King left. (December 3rd, Guomin News)</p>
<h3>Constitutional Disputes Emerge: The British Empire Reveals Its True Intentions; Prime Minister Runs Around to Mediate, Looking Worried; Autonomous Dominions Are Willing to Support the Government</h3>
<p>(London) According to well-informed sources, the situation caused by the constitutional dispute has greatly eased after the British King conferred with the Queen Mother, his brothers, and Prime Minister Baldwin last night. It is generally believed that a compromise proposal acceptable to all relevant parties, including the British King, the Cabinet, and the governments of the autonomous dominions, is currently being considered. The nature of this proposal has not yet been disclosed. When the House of Commons reconvened at 11:00 this morning, the Prime Minister was unwilling to disclose anything about the issue. The Prime Minister, in a tired tone and with a pale and worried face, answered questions from opposition leader Attlee, saying that he had nothing to report at this time. Attlee also asked when the truth about this matter could be disclosed to the public. The Prime Minister replied that he knew that the House of Commons was very concerned about this matter and eager to know the truth, but he could not continue to speak at the moment. The House of Lords also met at 11:00 this morning, but adjourned after just over a minute. Before the House of Commons convened today, cabinet members had been meeting for two hours, and they will continue to meet in the afternoon, as all cabinet members have canceled their daytime affairs. The British King slept for four hours at Belverdere Fortress, rising early in the morning. He did not take his usual morning walk in the garden. In the morning, his brother the Duke of York drove to Marlborough House to confer with the Queen Mother. The Duke's private secretary also visited the Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street. (December 4th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The Empire and the domestic government now believe that the British King's marriage has reached the point of "revealing the dagger after the map has been unrolled." The British King must either give up Mrs. Simpson or abdicate, one or the other. It is generally believed that the governments of the dominions are firmly supporting the domestic government's opinion, having resolutely stated that the autonomous dominions of the Empire do not approve of the current marriage. Telegrams between London and the capitals of the autonomous dominions are constantly being exchanged. It is expected that a concrete decision will be made in one or two days. The Cabinet, Buckingham Palace, and Marlborough House, where Queen Mary resides, were busy until after midnight last night. Prime Minister Baldwin entered Buckingham Palace at 9:15 last night to pay his respects to the British King, leaving after 55 minutes. At 10:40, the British King drove to Marlborough House to see his mother, returning to the palace 40 minutes later. At the same time, the Prime Minister went to the House of Commons to confer with Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs MacDonald, High Commissioner for the Union of South Africa in London Walters, and High Commissioner for Canada in London Massey. At 10:40, the Prime Minister left the House of Commons. Twenty minutes later, MacDonald, Walters, and Massey went to the Department of Autonomous Dominions to continue their discussions. Walters and Massey said goodbye to MacDonald at 11:40, both saying they had no comments to make and would return to their residences. MacDonald left the Department of Autonomous Dominions at ten minutes after midnight.</p>
<p>The House of Commons adjourned at 7:55 last night, completing its routine business three hours earlier than usual due to the constitutional dispute. Both Houses convened at 11:00 this morning.</p>
<p>It is reported that the autonomous dominions are now exercising their rights under the Statute of Westminster, and any issue they believe involves autonomy will be directly presented to the British King. Their telegrams to the domestic government express firm opinions, so the British King must now deal not only with his cabinet, but also with the various groups representing the opinions of the governments within the Empire. The opinions expressed by the autonomous dominions reflect their deep concern about the fact that the United States has not suppressed the coverage of the news, fearing that this will continue to affect the entire Empire.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the domestic government may not create legislation to allow for a compromise marriage, even if there is a legal possibility. Cabinet members clearly cannot force the King to abandon his lover or implement abdication, and the King can dismiss cabinet members or the cabinet can resign to express their dissatisfaction. However, in the current situation, it is difficult to find suitable candidates to replace the cabinet after resignation, so for the sake of the country and the Empire, neither dismissal nor resignation seems likely to occur.</p>
<p>Because the autonomous dominions are directly concerned about this matter, the opinions expressed in their telegrams must be taken into account. Therefore, the government will need at least a day or two to make a final decision.</p>
<p>Yesterday, crowds gathered near Buckingham Palace and the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street, standing for a long time, demonstrating the people's concern about this matter. All newspapers reported on the Prime Minister's meeting with opposition leader Attlee and the London-based commissioners for the autonomous dominions. Everyone is paying attention to these discussions. (December 4th, Reuters)</p>

<h3>British King Seeks Private Funds: Offers Canadian Property for Sale</h3>
<p>(London) It was learned here today that Antarctic explorer Ellsworth is now planning to purchase the British King's ranch in Canada. Negotiations on this matter began on Wednesday. The British King is willing to sell the land due to financial reasons. (December 4th, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) Yesterday morning, the King summoned three of his closest old friends to Belverdere Fortress. They were Home Secretary Major Alexander, Equerry Major Lee, and Assistant Private Secretary Dr. Thomas. It is generally believed that the King's meeting with Major Alexander may confirm his plan to abdicate, as the Home Secretary may need to prepare for the King's future financial matters. (December 3rd, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<h3>American People Add to the Discussion: Newspapers Sympathetic to the British King</h3>
<p>(New York) No one in the United States is not talking about King Edward's plan to marry the American Mrs. Simpson as Queen. In recent years, no event has attracted so much public attention. Many ordinary people express sympathy for the British King and are proud that an American woman may become Queen. However, other sectors, especially in Washington, are extremely concerned about the overall situation caused by this matter, fearing that it may trigger international repercussions. Chicago newspapers express sympathy for the British King, but also strongly emphasize the British King's obligations to the throne. (December 4th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Berlin Newspapers Exercise Caution in Reporting</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Semi-official sources recently notified newspapers, saying, "The British King and government currently have differing opinions on the marriage issue, the content of which seems to be related to the British King's private life." German newspapers must not publish any news or comments. (December 4th, Havas News)</p>

<h3>British House of Commons: Discusses the Wedding Issue; Even Without a Royal Mandate to Preside Over the Ceremony, Parliament Should Still Swear Allegiance to the King - Startling Motion by Opposition Member -</h3>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, opposition Labor leader Major Attlee questioned Prime Minister Baldwin about the King's wedding issue. The chamber was full, but it was solemn and silent. Major Attlee often said, "Has a constitutional difficulty arisen? Will the Prime Minister make an official statement today?" The Prime Minister immediately withdrew for a few minutes, and when he returned to his seat, his face was pale. He replied, "I do not intend to make any statement at this time. As for the so-called constitutional difficulty, it does not currently exist. In such a situation, it is inappropriate for you to ask me questions." Extreme Conservative leader Churchill then rose to speak, saying, "Can the Prime Minister provide us with assurances that there will be no irreversible actions before a formal statement is made to Parliament?" The Prime Minister replied, "I will consider Mr. Churchill's question, but that is all I will say at this time." Major Attlee continued to ask, "People are currently in a state of panic. Can the Prime Minister assure the House of Commons that a statement will be made as soon as possible?" The Prime Minister replied that this request would be considered. (December 3rd, Havas News)</p>
<p>Then former cabinet member Colonel Wedgwood (former Liberal member of the House of Commons, now independent, sitting in the opposition seats) proposed a motion in the House of Commons, stating that the oath of allegiance to the British King is not affected by any form of coronation ceremony or the absence of any dignitaries at the coronation. The House of Commons must not support anyone else as British King. The members of the House of Commons were greatly bewildered by this motion. Reuters learned that the "absence of any dignitaries" referred to by Wedgwood was referring to the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of Bradford, the Prime Minister, and other figures. Wedgwood told a Reuters reporter that the religious ceremony of coronation is merely a church tradition, and is not related to the British people other than the willingness to maintain customary practices. In any case, a King must be a King, and all costs must be spared to avoid the realization of abdication. (December 3rd, Reuters)</p>
<p>Wedgwood also stated that in any case, the act of abdication must be avoided at all costs, because "the current King is extremely popular with the people, and any change in the throne could plunge the country into a state of division. If the House of Commons were to hold a general election to solicit public opinion on the abdication issue, the result would be that the people would also be attached to the King. In short, this issue should not be decided solely by the cabinet, but should be decided by the entire Parliament, as was the case with Richard II." (Note: Richard II was born in 1367 and died in 1400, and abdicated in 1399) (December 3rd, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Hold a General Election to Test Public Opinion: Wedgwood's Proposal Resonates with Various Parties</h3>
<p>(London) As soon as the news of Wedgwood's motion in the House of Commons was broadcast, Wedgwood received 50 letters and telegrams in an instant, supporting his opinion that all costs should be spared to avoid the realization of the British King's abdication, and advocating holding a general election to seek national support for the British King. (December 3rd, Reuters)</p>
<h3>London Public Opinion: Filled with Enthusiasm for Support: Commoner Marriage Does Not Violate Tradition: Hope to Find a Proper Solution to Prevent Abdication from Occurring</h3>
<p>(London) Today, The Times published an editorial explaining its opposition to the marriage of the British King and Mrs. Simpson, stating that we must not misunderstand the nature of the opposition to the marriage proposed by the British King. It is important to know that the root cause of the opposition has been carefully reported by foreign newspapers and repeatedly expressed by domestic public opinion, all of which believe that it is due to a long-standing custom that the King should not marry a commoner or an American woman. If the British King can win the love of one of his citizens, then the whole country will share his happiness, and from the daughters of most American people, he may gain the same approval and marry them. However, there is a major obstacle to the marriage proposed by the British King this time, that is, the woman whom the King intends to marry has been divorced twice, and both of her former husbands are still alive.</p>
<p>The newspaper also stated that there is a general impression in Britain that the British King has informed the cabinet of his intention to marry, and the cabinet members have interfered with the British King's choice of spouse by objecting to it. According to the newspaper's parliamentary reporter today, the truth of the matter is that the British King has indicated that he intends to conclude a marriage that requires a special act of Parliament to pass, and he has first inquired whether this matter can be passed, and the cabinet ministers have all replied that it is impossible. Therefore, the theory that cabinet members interfered in the British King's private affairs is difficult to defend.</p>
<p>(London) The British newspapers' criticism of the British King's marriage remains very moderate, and they are full of enthusiastic love and sympathy for the King himself. Today, several widely circulated newspapers in Britain have gradually expressed their unwillingness to see the British King announce his abdication. For example, the Daily Mail contained a piece of news stating that more than 7,000 people gathered at Albert Hall last night, enthusiastically chanting "Long live the British King" and singing the national anthem. According to the newspaper, abdication is not a question, because the possible harms of this matter are limitless and will greatly affect the British Empire. Therefore, the federal nation, at this time of unprecedented global crisis, cannot abandon this King rich in talent and knowledge. The newspaper also said, "Abdication will not occur. The British King and the cabinet must find a way to resolve this matter. The people need their monarch, because the current King serves the Empire with loyalty and enthusiasm, and the national sentiment is extremely supportive of him." The Daily Express asked in its editorial, "Are we willing to lose the current King or retain him?" The answer is not difficult to see in the people's expressions. The News Chronicle said that there are now various signs that the public's sympathy for the British King is growing, and they feel that the King's abdication will cause misfortune. If there is a solution that both the British King and the cabinet can accept, the British people will feel very gratified. If the Empire loses its beloved King due to hasty decisions, the country will suffer a loss, which goes without saying. (December 4th, Reuters)</p>
<p>The Daily Mail reported that, "The King must choose to either marry or abdicate. All cabinet members are working diligently to preserve the dignity of the King and the British royal family. When Prime Minister Baldwin attended the House of Commons yesterday, the members present cheered him, showing that the cabinet's attitude has won the support of all parties, and the prime ministers of all autonomous dominions are also supporting him."

<h3>British King's Love Story: Mrs. Simpson Divorced Twice; Fell in Love with the King at a Banquet at First Sight</h3>
<p>(London) It is known that King Edward VIII first met Mrs. Simpson in 1933. At that time, Edward was the Prince of Wales. After ascending the throne, his status changed, and the relationship between the two became the subject of public discussion. Mrs. Simpson is 40 years old this year, two years younger than the British King. They first met at a banquet hosted by Mrs. Furness. Mrs. Simpson is naturally lively, and the British King fell in love at first sight, and then traveled together to various parts of Europe. This summer, the King traveled the Mediterranean, inseparable from Mrs. Simpson. Mrs. Simpson divorced her husband a month ago, and since then, a huge uproar has occurred with the cabinet. Mrs. Simpson has been divorced twice. Her first husband was named Spencer, a U.S. Army adjutant who served at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, so Mrs. Simpson is not without connections to China. However, this was ten years ago. Mrs. Simpson's maiden name is Wallfield Wallace. (December 3rd, Guomin News)</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister to Issue Declaration, Fulfilling Obligation to Aid Britain, Echoing Eden's Remarks</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies is scheduled to debate the government's foreign policy starting this Friday. According to official sources, Foreign Minister Delbos will issue a declaration in the Chamber of Deputies on Saturday, guaranteeing that if Britain is attacked without provocation, France will provide assistance. It is reported that British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in a speech in Leamington Spa that if France and Belgium were attacked without provocation, Britain would provide assistance. Therefore, Delbos decided to issue an official statement in the Chamber of Deputies to respond to Eden's speech and express that France is willing to bear the obligations stipulated in the Locarno Treaty with Britain. Official sources also stated that Delbos will reiterate that France remains committed to the Covenant of the League of Nations and the treaties France has signed with Central and Eastern European countries. France will not accept any solutions to Western European issues that do not guarantee the aforementioned treaties. As for the Spanish situation, France will consistently support the non-intervention policy. Finally, Delbos will announce that France firmly upholds the principle of freedom of navigation on the seas and will closely monitor the situation to ensure that France's interests in the Mediterranean are protected.

<p>(Tokyo) Yoshida, Director of the Investigation Bureau, suddenly submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Hirota on the 4th. The Prime Minister reported this at the Cabinet meeting on the 4th, and it was decided to issue an order on the 5th, appointing Ishiguro Jotaro, investigator of the Cabinet Investigation Bureau, as acting Director of the Cabinet Investigation Bureau. It is reported that Director Yoshida was requested by Prime Minister Hirota to stay on at the time of the cabinet formation, to maintain close contact with the military and to expect the current cabinet to realize the so-called comprehensive renewal of government. However, since the issue of important national policies on the 7th of this month, the government's actions have been contrary to his expectations, and he has expressed great dissatisfaction with the current cabinet. Especially since the issue of administrative reform became public recently, the opinions of the Investigation Bureau have rarely been adopted. Yoshida is regarded as a representative of the military's strong reform opinions, and there have also been calls for criticism from political parties.

<h3>Japanese Naval Landing Party Lands Armed in Qingdao, Posts Abound, Like Facing a Major Enemy, Searching Party Headquarters and Arresting Many People</h3>
<p>Qingdao News, the workers of various Japanese-owned textile factories in this city once went on strike to demand improved treatment from the factories. The city authorities have tried their best to mediate, and the factories have resumed operations one after another. Unexpectedly, the factories refused to fulfill the terms of the agreement and dismissed more than three people without cause, which further provoked a labor unrest. Factories such as Dakang, Nei Wai Mian, and Longxing also went on strike one after another. In order to preemptively strike, the factories jointly decided at noon on the 2nd of this month to suddenly close all six other factories that did not participate in the strike, causing tens of thousands of workers to lose their jobs overnight and creating an unstable situation in the market. The factories also requested the Navy to send nine warships to patrol the front and rear seas to demonstrate, citing the protection of factories and expatriates. At around 3:00 AM on the 3rd of this month, more than a thousand naval landing party members suddenly landed armed, and rushed to the areas around the country's factories in Dongzhen, Sifang, and Cangku, posting abudant positions like facing a major enemy. They also sent teams to occupy various key points to cut off traffic. They then went to the city party headquarters, the Jiaoji Railway Party Headquarters, the National Martial Arts Hall, the First Section of the Jiaoji Railway Police, the Municipal Library, and the Pingmin Daily News, searching each one, and arrested nine people including Xiang Zongding, secretary of the National Martial Arts Hall, and Zhang Legu, editor of the Pingmin Daily News, and detained them at the Japanese Naval Assembly Hall on Diping Road for strict interrogation. It is said that the reason for the arrest of Xiang and Zhang was that they had launched a patriotic movement and donated funds to support Suiyuan. The Japanese side believes that this labor unrest was incited by the patriotic movement. When the Japanese army carried out the search, they also confiscated all the guns and ammunition of a part of the Public Security Bureau's security team and the First Section of the Jiaoji Railway Police, but returned the guns and ammunition immediately afterwards. After receiving the report, the city government was led by Mayor Shen Honglie to convene the heads of the various bureaus to discuss countermeasures. On one hand, they telegraphed the central government to report the situation of the Japanese Navy landing in Qingdao and requested instructions on everything. On the other hand, they made a serious protest with the Japanese consulate and the Navy. The Japanese army also knew that they were in the wrong and released the arrested people at the same time. At 12:30 PM, the Public Security Bureau sent police to bring back the arrested people. Mayor Shen personally consoled the arrested people. In the afternoon, the Japanese Marine Corps began to return to the ships one after another, but the Japanese troops stationed in the factories remained on guard at each factory. They also dispatched armed patrol teams to patrol the city from time to time, and the citizens avoided them. However, the order of the city remains normal, and there are no changes at present. According to Mr. Zhang, who was arrested, when he was released, the Japanese military authorities strictly instructed that newspapers are not allowed to publish any news about anti-Japanese and patriotic movements in the future, otherwise they will be dealt with by military law.</p>
<h3>Tensions in Suiyuan, Hebei Province's Aid-Sui Movement is Enthusiastic, Education Sector Takes the Lead in Unanimous Response, Farmers and Merchants Follow Suit and Actively Contribute</h3>
<p>Baoding Correspondence: Since the situation in Suiyuan became critical, our troops fighting bandits on the front lines have been winning victories in the frozen wasteland, and have recently bravely recovered Bailingmiao, which has inspired the entire nation. Recently, the matter of sending supplies and comforting the troops has swept the country like a storm, and the enthusiastic emotions have reached a boiling point. Hebei Province is located in the gateway to North China, and although it is currently still in a state of temporary peace, the future evolution is also of great importance. Therefore, the inspiring atmosphere of the people of this province is extremely profound. Starting from Baoding, where the provincial capital is located, to the counties, villages, and towns, they have launched an aid-Sui movement, actively sending supplies. All official and private schools have begun to organize various forms of aid-Sui movement. As for official propaganda lectures and street fundraising, in order to maintain public order and respect the wishes of the local authorities, they are generally not carried out. Although the surface is very quiet, the enthusiastic spirit of the people has indeed penetrated the lower levels. Therefore, in recent decades, the education sector in Hebei Province has taken the lead in launching the "Donate One Day's Income to Contribute to the Government" campaign. The Baoding Colleges and Museums Federation took the lead by example, donating 2,500 yuan and sending a condolence delegation to Suiyuan to comfort the troops. Zhao County, Renqiu, Xincheng, Qingyuan, and other counties have responded one after another and donated money successively. The Hebei Provincial Medical College has also organized a medical team, providing its own medicines to set off to the front. The Provincial Women's Normal School has also recently held a large-scale fundraising entertainment fair to raise large sums of money to purchase woolen cloth, foreign leather, etc., and personally rush to make fur sets for the soldiers fighting the enemy, so as to send them to the front to keep out the cold. In addition to doing their best to raise funds, all the teachers and students of Baoding Middle School have also set out on different routes, going deep into the rural suburbs and persuading merchants and farmers. They have achieved great success in recent days. Therefore, in addition to the education sector unanimously conducting the aid-Sui movement in Hebei Province, farmers, merchants, and even vendors in other counties have also followed suit and are increasing day by day. There are many people who donate one or two yuan, or even one or two dimes, or even two or three cents. Some ordinary citizens only know to donate money to comfort the troops, but do not know where to donate, so there are many people who ask the police where to donate. This kind of enthusiastic emotion is enough to make us feel extremely excited and gratified. (2nd) There are more and more unemployed people. If they lack food, they will inevitably take risks. Local security is worrying. It is reported that Guangdong Province relies on Annam and Siam for its food supply. In the past, foreign rice imports were not taxed, because food is the most important thing for the people. If there is surplus food in the market, it can be expected that every family will have enough to eat. Even in recent times, when the customs levies taxes, it is feared that foreign rice will be dumped, which will hurt farmers and hinder their livelihoods. The tax rate on foreign rice is inherently elastic, and can be adjusted according to the situation to regulate the market. Now, Guangdong Province has suffered from summer floods and autumn droughts, and a famine is imminent. The price of rice is also rising, and there is a trend of continued increase. The people are complaining and the situation is dangerous. Han Mou and Mu Song have repeatedly discussed that it is impossible to provide relief without suppressing the price of rice. Moreover, the winter defense is tight, and the people are poor and prone to theft. It is estimated that there will be another half year before the next harvest, so it is urgently necessary to stabilize the price of rice to alleviate the people's difficulties. It is proposed that the central government should consider the famine in Guangdong Province and the difficulty of the people's food supply, and order the Guangdong Customs to temporarily exempt foreign rice imports from taxes from the date of the order until the end of July 26, in order to reduce costs and gradually stabilize the price of rice. Once the early rice is harvested next year and the harvest is abundant, the taxes can be reinstated. The people of Guangdong will be deeply grateful. In addition to submitting a report to the Executive Yuan and a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, we jointly request your review and implementation.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province is Suffering from Famine and the Price of Rice is Extremely High, Authorities Appeal to the Central Government to Temporarily Remove the Foreign Rice Tax to Stabilize the Price of Rice and Relieve the Current Distress of the People</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province has recently suffered a poor late rice harvest, and the domestic supply of food is insufficient. The import of foreign rice has been cut off due to excessive taxation. In this transition period, the price of rice is high and rises several times a day. Currently, one yuan can only buy six or seven catties of brown rice, and the lives of ordinary people are difficult. The lower classes are working hard all day long, and are sighing "have food but no place to live" or "have a place to live but no food to eat." This is because there are many unemployed people in the society, and the people are about to take risks. The future of public security is truly unbearable. The Rice Industry Association has previously strongly advocated the abolition of the foreign rice import tax in order to regulate the grain supply and prevent the interruption of the source, which is a symptomatic treatment for stabilizing the price of rice. After this proposal was launched, the provincial government and the Department of Finance also considered it feasible. They convened several studies by financial experts and decided to maintain the food supply. On the one hand, they negotiated with Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces to transport rice to Guangdong. On the other hand, they decided to ask the central authorities to order the Guangdong Customs to temporarily abolish the foreign rice import tax until the early rice harvest in June or July of next year, and then reinstate the tax in order to relieve the current panic over food. Yesterday, Yu Hanmou, Director of the Guangdong Pacification Office, and Huang Musong, Chairman of the Provincial Government, jointly sent a telegram to the central government, the original text of which is as follows: Director Jiang of the Executive Yuan, Guangdong Province's rice production has always been insufficient. Even in good years, it is only enough for a few months. This summer's floods have resulted in no hope of a harvest. The price of rice is rising every day, with each yuan only buying six or seven catties. At this time of rural bankruptcy, the lives of the people are difficult.</p>
<h3>Guizhou Province Abolishes Exorbitant Taxes, Amounting to 1.28 Million Yuan Annually</h3>
<p>Guiyang Correspondence: Since the Republic of China, there have been many changes and chaos, and the central government's policies cannot be unified. Various provinces have embraced military separatism and drained the pond to catch all the fish. Ordinary taxes are insufficient, and exorbitant taxes are flourishing. Guizhou, a corner of the country, is no exception. In recent years, the central government has been unified, Guizhou's provincial administration has been reformed, and the province has started anew with the people. The abolition of exorbitant taxes has been listed as the key to governance. The reporter believes that this kind of record should have accurate statistics, so he does not avoid the tediousness of detailing the names and figures of the exorbitant taxes that have been abolished in each county of this province, based on what can be investigated, as follows: At the end of the fourth year, a total of 160 types of donations and taxes were abolished, amounting to more than 100,000 yuan annually. In addition, those that were abolished uniformly throughout the province include the tobacco acreage tax in each county, amounting to 1.14 million yuan annually, and the national calendar tax in each county, which was too harsh and detailed to be statistically significant. As for this year, those newly ordered to be abolished include the provincial middle school deed tax surcharge collected on behalf of 94 counties including Chishui (because the provincial middle school is completely supported by the province), as well as the Chishui grain tax, the orphanage surcharge donation, the Wuchuan lacquer export donation, the Danjiang goods donation, the Qingxi market donation, and several types of Guiyang city stall donations. The statistics show that the total amount of exorbitant tax donations abolished before and after amounts to more than 1.28 million yuan annually. If we add the profits of the contractors and the embezzlement of the tax collectors, the number should be twice as much. At present, there are still many local donations and taxes in each county, but they are mostly used to fund local education or have other legitimate uses. If they were completely abolished suddenly, various local undertakings would inevitably be affected. The combing, sorting, and tracking of the orbit remains to be the effort of the financial authorities.</p>
<h3>The Construction of Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Kunshan is Completed</h3>

<h3>Suzhou Inspects the Xiangcheng Parricide Case</h3>
<p>Gong A'gen, the son of Gong Qian, a rural woman from Qiu Jiabang Village, Xiangcheng, Suxiang, recently had a dispute with his mother over a trivial matter. Unexpectedly, A'gen threw a stool violently at his elderly mother, causing Gong Qian to be injured and bleed profusely from her face and other places. Later, her younger brother Qian Xueyuan treated her unsuccessfully. On the 3rd, Gong Qian died of her injuries. The neighbors in the village were very upset and twisted the rebellious son A'gen to the seventh sub-office of the Public Security Bureau and sent him to the local court on the same day with Qian Xueyuan.

<p>Gao A'xing, a 53-year-old villager from Shedu Dam Village, Di Rang Township, Zhang Zhenqiao, Luoshe, County, farmer, wife Wu, with four sons and one daughter. A'xing was weak and often bullied. On the 1st of this month, Wang Fuhai, a villager from Beitangli, Qianwang Township, and Wang Jinfu, a villager from Da'anqiao Township, Fushan Township, borrowed five yuan in legal currency from A'xing, but A'xing refused. Later, Jinfu and Fuhai went to A'xing's house and took a load of rice without permission, sold it for three yuan and six corners, and divided the money. The next day, Gao's wife, Wu, negotiated with the two and went to the Luoshe teahouse to reason, but to no avail. At this time, Gao A'xing suddenly disappeared and did not return until late at night. The day before yesterday, in the early morning, A'fu Niang, while passing by a broken three-room house in Shedu Dam Village, saw A'xing's body in the broken house. From the situation, he was strangled to death. A white belt was wrapped around his neck. When his wife, Wu, heard the news, she suspected Wang Fuhai and Wang Jinfu, and twisted them into the second police station of Luoshe Public Security Bureau and transferred them to the General Bureau for interrogation. On one hand, Liu Jianquan, the head of the fifth bao, and Jia Yunchang, the head of the fourteenth and third tu, reported to the court to request a phase inspection. Yesterday (4th) at 8:00 AM, Prosecutor Huang led Zhang Examination Official and bailiffs, etc., took a motorboat to the countryside to conduct a phase inspection. It was verified that the body was indeed strangled and hung on the belt. He ordered the corpse's wife to place the corpse in a coffin and wait for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Zhenjiang: Two Banks Rectify Subsidiary Currency</h3>
<p>In view of the prevalence of private notes in the counties north of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province, and the deeply rooted malpractices they engendered, the Jiangsu Provincial Government had repeatedly issued strict prohibitions. However, there was a severe shortage of subsidiary currency in the market, and the need was extremely high. In order to eliminate private notes and facilitate the people, the Provincial Government, upon consulting the Ministry of Finance and obtaining its approval, authorized the Jiangsu Farmers Bank and the Jiangsu Bank to jointly issue subsidiary currency notes of 10-cent, 20-cent, and 50-cent denominations, totaling 3 million yuan, to provide relief. In accordance with the central government's approved method, they jointly provided cash and various guarantees as reserves, which were transferred to the Central Bank for storage and safekeeping. Since their issuance, they have circulated freely throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River. The Jiangsu Farmers Bank and Jiangsu Bank branches in various locations fully exchange them for legal currency, and public and private institutions alike universally accept them, providing convenience to merchants and the people. In the future, private notes will gradually be eliminated, which can be a great help in consolidating finance in Jiangsu Province. It is also reported that the 10-cent notes issued by the Xuzhou Ping City Official Money Bureau are also being fully exchanged by the two banks.</p>

<h3>University Football Second Round: Guanghua vs. Jinan Today; 2:30 PM at Jinan University in Zhenru; Tongji vs. Fudan at Fudan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai University Sports Federation football championship began on the 28th of last month. Because only Fudan, Jinan, Guanghua, and Tongji are participating this year, a single round-robin system is being adopted, so there are actually only six games, held in three rounds. Today is the second round, with two games scheduled: Guanghua vs. Jinan and Tongji vs. Fudan. Tongji is relatively weak, so its chances of winning are slim. Fudan has the advantage of home field and is very confident of winning this year's championship. As for the Guanghua-Jinan match, although Jinan has the initial advantage of home field and its strength is also growing rapidly, Guanghua has been unusually strong this season, repeatedly achieving impressive results, and its future is unlimited. When they meet today, there should be a wonderful contest. Since Jiangda was reorganized into the Shanghai University Sports Federation, the scope has become narrower and the number of participating units has decreased. Looking back at the lively and enthusiastic scenes of Jiangda football matches in previous years, which attracted the attention of the entire Shanghai, and comparing them with today's decline and obscurity, the difference is immeasurable. Today's schedule is as follows:</p>
<h3>Western Youth Basketball: Qingguang Lost to McLing B Yesterday; 43 to 36</h3>

In the first quarter, Shakel attacked hard and won 14-7. In the second quarter, Mingqiang tried its best to resist and surprisingly showed impressive momentum, winning 11-5. In the third quarter, both sides were cautious and the score was very close. As a result, Shakel won again 8-6. In the last quarter, Mingqiang had a good performance, but Shakel scored continuously, so Mingqiang only took the lead by 10-9. The final result was a 34-34 tie, so overtime was played for three minutes. Shakel relied on Gu Lunsi's last shot to secure the victory, resulting in a 36-34 victory for Shakel.

Although McLing tried hard to catch up, Qingguang still won the first half 24-22. Switching sides, Qingguang was still very strong and led 28-24, and then led 30-27. However, due to a lack of stamina, McLing seized the opportunity to score 21-12, reversing the situation. The final result was 43-36, with McLing winning. The schedule for today and the results of yesterday's games are listed below:</p>

Medina made 21 shots to reach the goal, averaging slightly less than 14 points per shot. The highest scores were 124, 53, 39, 21, 40, and 38. Zhang Yingda scored 23 and 24. In this 300-point short-distance goal, Medina scored over 20 points seven times, including 45 points and 39 points twice, which were achieved by unexpected luck. The Portuguese are very skilled in pocketing. Once they get into a rhythm, they continue to score. When they finally reached 300 points, the 56-point shot was not yet finished. Zhang Yingda is better at open shots than pocketing. He had bad luck yesterday, with many balls hitting the edge of the pocket. The goal was only 300 points, which gave the hero no room to maneuver. Zhang had no choice but to watch his defeat. As a result of the five-game match between the two teams, Portugal won.</p>

In the second quarter, both sides defended tightly, and it was very difficult to score. Although Fudan launched a major counterattack, they only scored three goals, while Qixiu also scored two. Although Fudan pulled back two points, the distance was still large. In the third quarter, Fudan gradually made progress, still leading 5-2. In the last quarter, Qixiu won by a narrow margin of 4-2. In the end, due to the large losses in the first quarter, Fudan lost 14-26.</p>

Fudan's Ma Zhou and Fu scored every time they shot, reversing the score to 15-12 at the end of the first half. In the second half, Jinan's Yu Yao Ya scored continuously, and Wang Han also added three points, surpassing Fudan again 19-15. Fudan's players tried their best to start scoring, but Cai Yanxiong scored again, leading by two points. Ma Zhou made one of one free throw, bringing the score to 21-20. Fudan chased to within one point again. Before long, Yin Guiren scored two consecutive shots, and Chen Zongqi also made two free throws. The score was still in the twenties. Jinan's Cai Wang was too hasty and lost two chances under the basket. After Wang Nanzhen made a free throw, Zhou Dayun chased to 24-26. Jinan urgently called a timeout, changed from attack to defense, and Kuang Yaoya seized the opportunity to score again, reversing the victory with a score of 28-24.</p>

But soon Wulong became active again, ending the first half with a score of 12-16, with Wulong in the lead. At the start of the second half, Chizhi suddenly rose up, surpassing Wulong 23-20. Wulong fought hard to cope, but Chizhi still took the lead. After 27-27, Chizhi became sharper again, and Wulong declined. After 37-34, Chizhi became more and more courageous, scoring four more goals in one breath, resulting in a 46-36 victory for Chizhi.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Standard Yarn Reaches New High at Closing, Spot Transactions at 262.5 Yuan for Current Month, 1,200 Bales Transacted</h3>
<p>The previously declining yarn market rebounded yesterday with a significant surge. The rationale for this surge is attributed to a shortage of spot goods. Only about a thousand bales remain in warehouses. Simultaneously, the Qingdao Japanese Cotton Mill, with 500,000 spindles, has completely ceased operations. Northern merchants are also procuring yarn, and merchants from Sichuan also have strong buying intentions. However, factories are struggling to supply enough spot goods, leading to heightened sentiment and rising market prices. December futures climbed above the 260 yuan mark, reaching a new high of 260.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Futures for all Months Increase by Six to Seven Yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard yarn trading session, all months showed an upward trend. However, news of the landing of Japanese marines in Qingdao and the complete shutdown of the Qingdao yarn mill created uncertainty, as these two pieces of news seemed contradictory. After the second trading session, the December contract showed particularly strong upward momentum, approaching the 260 yuan mark. Many speculated that yarn prices in Qingdao were soaring, with merchants from Tianjin procuring spot yarn and those from Sichuan also making moves. As a result, the market became increasingly tight, advancing rapidly. Today, prices exceeded 260 yuan, with long-term contracts performing well at closing. Consequently, all months rose by 4.5 to 5.3 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The market remained strong after the afternoon opening. Near-term contracts showed stronger upward momentum, while long-term contracts remained relatively stable. During the second afternoon session, rumors resurfaced, causing a sudden drop of 1.3 to 1.4 yuan. By the third closing, there were reports of 1,200 bales of spot yarn still being transacted, boosting morale. Prices for all days reached new highs. At closing, prices for all months rose by an additional 1.6 to 2.4 yuan compared to the morning closing. Selling orders included 2,000 bales from Juxing, 1,100 bales from Yuda, 2,400 bales from Zhenda, 950 bales from Minghua, 3,400 bales from Yicheng, 1,800 bales from Taichang, 1,850 bales from Yichang, 1,000 bales from Hengchang, 1,850 bales from Shengyuan, 1,700 bales from Changyu, 3,000 bales from Hengde, and 1,600 bales from Dachangcheng. Purchase orders included 1,750 bales from Hengyi, 3,700 bales from Dafeng, 3,550 bales from Mingde, 3,700 bales from Hexing, 8,750 bales from Changfeng, 1,050 bales from Tonghe, 1,300 bales from Jinchang, 2,000 bales from Shenji, 2,300 bales from Runkang, 2,000 bales from Fukang, and 2,000 bales from Xincheng. A comparison is provided below:</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Also Increases by Three Yuan</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are still considerable. It is estimated that all merchants bought a total of 1,210 bales throughout the day. The selling price increased by 2 yuan. Yesterday's "Ten-Count Five Lions" was actually "Five Stars"; the reporter who copied the price list made a mistake. This is hereby corrected. The purchase volume of each merchant is as follows:</p>
<h3>Also Affected by the Qingdao Strike, Cotton Prices Feel Unsupported</h3>
<p>The cotton market was originally flat. However, the yarn market has been rising daily, affecting the raw materials. However, the Qingdao yarn mill stoppage has negatively impacted sentiment, resulting in a stable market with moderated price increases. Factory demand is still sustainable.</p>
<p>Assisted by Period Yarn to Some Extent</p>
<p>At the opening of standard cotton trading, the market appeared sluggish and weak, as the complete shutdown of Qingdao yarn mills had a significant impact on sentiment. Additionally, the American and Indian cotton markets were trending downward. The number of buyers in the market was low. After the second session, the market rebounded slightly due to the positive performance of the yarn market. Consequently, prices for all months rose by 0.15 to 0.3 yuan compared to the previous day's closing. The market price was still uneven after the afternoon opening. Later, as yarn prices reached new highs, the market sentiment became volatile but firm. As a result, prices for all months rose by an additional 0.15 to 0.25 yuan compared to the morning closing. Selling orders included 2,800 dan from Shengyuan, 3,000 dan from Juxing, 10,700 dan from Mingde, 2,700 dan from Fengtai, 3,600 dan from Shenji, 3,600 dan from Yicheng, 3,000 dan from Yichang, 5,500 dan from Yongda, 7,900 dan from Yuanxingchang, 2,000 dan from Changji, and 2,000 dan from Changfeng. Purchase orders included 2,600 dan from Hexing, 4,600 dan from Yuda, 1,300 dan from Renfeng, 3,700 dan from Xiecheng, 6,500 dan from Xincheng, 6,000 dan from Changhe, 5,000 dan from Zhenda, 2,700 dan from Gengfeng, 2,900 dan from Dachangcheng, and 2,400 dan from Tonghe. A comparison is provided below:</p>
<p>Arrivals Consist Mainly of General Grade Cotton</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is slightly sluggish, and factory demand has turned sluggish. The source of cotton is 300 bales of Yaohua cotton.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Ends the Day Firm</h3>
<p>American cotton prices opened down 7 to 12 points for all months, with trading being relatively slow. Liverpool's consumption was poor, and the political situation in England was unstable. The December contract had 14 delivery notices, prompting bulls to close out positions and foreign merchants to short sell, all contributing to the early morning price decline. Later, industry players bought in, short positions covered, and the stock market was strong, leading to a market rebound. New accounts from outside the industry gradually increased, but buyers remained cautious. The closing was firm, with spot prices rising by 1 point and futures falling by 3 points to rising by 2 points. English cotton fell by 1 point in spot and 5-6 points in futures. Indian cotton speculators bought in, driven by short selling. Later, prices weakened due to poor consumption in Liverpool. Bengal and Oomra fell by 1 rupee, while White Broach fell by 0.75 rupees. Original telegram recorded (from the 3rd).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 4th was White Broach at 219 rupees, Oomra at 198 rupees, and Bengal at 160.25 rupees, all unchanged.</p>
<p>Osaka telegram, 4th: Three-grade futures yarn rose by 0.7 to fall by 1.1 yuan, with near-term at 244.7 yuan and long-term at 217.9 yuan. Cotton futures fell by 0.25 to 0.55 yuan, with near-term at 67.1 yuan and long-term at 67.9 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth is Easy to Rise, Difficult to Fall, Bleached Cloth Rises Nearly One Yuan, Yesterday Prices of Various Goods Rose Several Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was characterized by strong sales in both the north and south. Labor unrest broke out again at the Japanese-owned Nisshin Cotton Mill, and yarn prices, which had softened slightly the day before, rebounded sharply yesterday. Sentiment was unanimously firm, with strong buying intentions, leading to purchases as prices rose, causing the market to soar. Coarse cloth, which had previously seen sluggish sales in the north, experienced a relatively moderate increase in prices for heavyweight varieties. However, with current inventories depleted, the price increase has become rapid. Yesterday, the market rose sharply by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan (per bolt). Lightweight fine cloth rose by 0.2 yuan, while plain fine cloth and dyed cloth rose by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan (per bolt). Flannel and Zhigong velvet also continued to rise by 2.5 li (per yard). Bleached cloth, currently out of season, had a rather low market price. However, the rising prices of new gray cloth from factories were very rapid, creating a significant gap. As the peak sales season for long-distance customers is approaching, high-end bleached cloth inventories have rapidly increased by nearly 1 yuan (per bolt). Printed Zhigong, Serge, Colored Zhigong, and Satin, although off-season, have significantly higher gray cloth prices than before. Sentiment is optimistic, and sales have also slightly improved, with market prices rebounding by 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 yuan per bolt, respectively. Japanese firms such as Toyo Menka Kaisha, Nisshin, and Ito have collectively issued nearly 2,000 pieces of white fine cloth and fine twill for February and March, with prices also increasing gradually. However, they are still about 0.5 yuan lower than the current spot market prices. The January quota has already been exhausted, and factories are shipping out spot goods daily, but they are still insufficient to meet customer demand.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Orders See Resurgence, Market Goods are Scarce and Insufficient for Sales, Shipments are Particularly Heavy in March and April</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the woolen fabric market remained excellent. Local and inland merchants continued to show strong interest in purchasing men's and women's colored overcoat woolen fabrics, with particularly strong sales. Western firms had robust shipments, and domestic products were largely insufficient to meet sales demand. Benchmark prices were firm both openly and secretly. Merchants were able to profit from most of the goods they had previously acquired. Recognizing the scarcity of market goods and active sales, merchants placed more orders with Western firms, leading to a resurgence in ordering activity. Merchants were actively ordering goods for spring, summer, autumn, and winter, especially English and Japanese goods for shipment in March and April of next year.</p>
<h3>Food: Flour Prices All Hit Four Yuan, Outside Buyers' Enthusiastic Purchases Cause Unusual Surge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market, after opening in the morning, displayed an initial period of stability, followed by a sharp surge across all months. Foreign wheat quotations from Chicago and Canada were down 0.1 to 0.2 jiao, while Liverpool also experienced a significant drop of 0.1 to 0.2 pence. Therefore, when prices opened, the current month showed weakness, opening at only 0.96 yuan, down a fen from the previous day. However, starting with the January contract, outside buyers drove eager purchases, causing prices to jump by 0.2 to 0.3 fen immediately. After the second session, factories covered their near-term positions, pushing prices above the 4 yuan mark. Factories were shorting long-term contracts, so while buying interest was strong, the increase was more moderate. When the market opened in the afternoon, the current month saw inquiries from merchant houses, and factories also slightly covered, raising prices as high as 4.04 yuan. However, bulls closed out positions, causing prices to fall back by 0.1 to 0.2 fen. Large outside players continued to buy eagerly in the long-term contracts, and market sentiment continued to rise. Given the current situation, domestic supplies are scarce and foreign wheat prices are not favorable, so market sentiment is unlikely to stabilize.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market, after opening in the morning, showed an initial period of stability, followed by a firm trend across all months. Foreign wheat quotations unanimously reported declines. However, market sentiment was firm due to domestic wheat prices not easing and the purchasing and stockpiling by the military and civilians in the northern regions being stronger than in this port. Therefore, despite the fall in foreign wheat, market sentiment remained firm, with only minor fluctuations of 0.1 to 0.2 fen across all months. When the market opened in the afternoon, sentiment improved again. There were reports of slight futures purchases by Tianjin factories, and merchants from Shaanxi continued to purchase spot wheat, leading to increased transactions and a market rebound of 0.3 to 0.4 fen. However, the market value was already high, and buyers were inevitably watching, so the upward trend gradually leveled off, which was not without reason. In the spot wheat market, there were no official transactions due to customers selling and factories not being interested. It was reported that merchants from Shaanxi purchased more than 20 tons, with Gaoyou wheat opening at 6.55 yuan and Yanghe wheat at 6.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Customer White Rice Sales Rebound Yesterday in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Yesterday's customer white rice market situation: the supply continued unabated, and most of the owners intended to sell. Therefore, although there were actions such as strikes and transport blockades for river rice, the market price of customer white rice did not improve. Because the main route of customer white rice is the Guangdong sales market, and Guangdong has not had a smooth channel for a long time, the market showed that supply exceeded demand, and the situation immediately trended downward. But the arrival volume yesterday and the day before was slightly reduced, and the digestion was still active, so the market can still stand. Shantou and this street's digestion are all active. In the afternoon, Henan continued to handle it, and the market situation began to show signs of being popular. The opening throughout the day was 2,673 bags of Gan rice, 1,050 bags of Xiang rice, 1,720 bags of Wenhe Yong various rice, and 500 bags of factory yuan. The price was similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3>Japonica Rice Store Sales are Watching</h3>
<p>(Yesterday, the source of various gangs in Shanghai South was slightly sparser than before. A total of more than 80 households arrived, with more than 16,000 names in total. Among them, more than 50 households were Bo Dao, but the sales market on this street also suddenly declined slightly. Pingjin Qiyan and other gangs only handled more than 6,000 bags of Bo Dao (and more than 1,000 bags of thick japonica, so the market turned flat again. As a result, the market conditions of thick and thin japonica did not show any glory or shame. Due to the lack of goods, Dujian continued to perform well for 5 cents. Yang Jian was flat, Yinyuan was high and low,</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, the chairman of the rice industry consulted with his colleagues that more than 200 rice boats that are currently being detained in Jiading County. The Municipal Social Bureau forwarded a telegram to the Provincial Government, hoping that they would be released within two or three days, so the public's hearts were stable. Although the stores did not have much inventory, they heard this news and that a large number of rice boats would come to Shanghai, so they instead stood by and watched and did not buy. The various goods were sluggish and did not digest. The market conditions of high-quality japonica were stable due to the lack of goods, and the price of high-quality japonica was small. The price of top-quality Bo Dao was flat, and the price of medium-quality Bo Dao early rice was a little over a tenth. The price of Yang Jian was nearly a tenth lower, and the price of Bu Dujian was a few cents lower. Yinyuan was showing signs of fatigue again, but the customer's supply was dry, and the price remained tight.</p>

<h3>Securities: Government Bond Market Fluctuates Greatly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange government bond market continued to be weak, and the trend continued to brew. The public's minds were even more confused by the current situation. However, the bulls and bears were fiercely opposed to each other, and there were large amounts of trading in and out. As a result, the market price fluctuated more violently, and the amount of chips thrown out on the table was very strong, and the market price fell across the board. However, because the bulls and bears were both strong, the rise and fall in the short term was still within a certain range. Yesterday morning, the market opened very weakly. Grade E was heavily sold off in No. 3, and it fell sharply by 5 to 6 cents, and retail investors also sold off in groups. Grades D and B also fell by 5 cents to 4 cents. In the second session, the trend turned firmer, and Nos. 10, 22, 47, etc. bought in strongly, while Nos. 5, 10, 5, etc. sold off. The market price rebounded across the board from Grade E by 1 to 4.5 cents. In the afternoon, the market price went from firm to weak. Grade D No. 35 had a very strong appetite and rose by 5 cents to 4 cents. Long-term contracts in Grade C rose, and retail investors sold off. Nos. 35 and 10 also turned to selling. Grades A and B fell again by about 1 cent. At the close, Nos. 45 and 18 suddenly had a large amount of selling, and the market price continued to decline weakly, all down by a little over a tenth to 6 cents. However, Nos. 10 and 32 bought in quite a bit. The result for the whole day was a uniform decline of 1.5 to 4 cents. Grade A for this month rose by 5 cents. The total number of transactions was 6,977,700 yuan. The rise and fall and high and low are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>Thoughts on the Memorial of the Zhaohe Uprising</h3>
<p>— Yang Hu</p>
<p>Twenty-one years have passed since the Zhaohe Uprising. Recalling the past and looking to the future, I cannot help but feel deeply moved again. Therefore, I express my thoughts and tell my fellow countrymen: The Xinhai Revolution, which overthrew the Manchu Qing, was only a preliminary goal. After overthrowing the Manchu Qing, we must always guide the national power back to the people, abolish unequal treaties externally, and strive for both material and psychological construction internally, so that the country can enter a truly free and equal realm. Therefore, on the day the Republic of China was established, the Premier of our party showed this revolutionary proposition to the future. Unfortunately, the party members of that day were weak in will, fearful of difficulties, and content with the status quo, deceived by the rhetoric of "the revolutionary army rises, the revolutionary party disappears," and no longer adhered to the initial revolutionary beliefs. As a result, the revolutionary cause suffered a great setback in both substance and spirit. From the second year of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai carried out large loans, recruited troops and purchased weapons, cultivated party members, and eliminated dissidents. When his wings were completed, he did not hesitate to overthrow the Republic of China and declare himself emperor. In order to seek foreign aid, he did not hesitate to sign traitorous treaties, opening up opportunities for powerful neighbors to covet, and almost causing the disaster of national subjugation and extinction. Today, the national crisis is so serious. How can we know that it was not Yuan Shikai's momentary mistake that accumulated and formed? If the party members of that day could all understand the revolutionary proposition, obey the leader's orders, and not fear difficulties or be content with the status quo, Yuan Shikai, although he thought of stealing the divine weapon and satisfying his dictatorial desires, would not be able to act recklessly and do whatever he wanted. Therefore, the Zhaohe Uprising's opposition to Yuan Shikai was also to alert those who did not revolutionize or pretended to revolutionize to their ignorance and harm to the country. This is one. For thousands of years, Chinese scholars and officials have been deceived by the benefits of the art of diplomacy, so they have become skilled in seizing, coercing, and tempting, which has become the worldly skill of Chinese scholars and officials. When Yuan Shikai was in power, he gathered all of this into one. What he sought in politics was not to benefit the country and the people, but to cultivate party members for personal gain. What he associated with in society was not righteousness and sympathy, but conflicts of interest. Therefore, ambitious people used treacherous strategies as a ladder to seek advancement, and scholars all over the world ran around for fame and gain. Therefore, when Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor, countless shameless people submitted memorials urging him to advance, and even beggars organized groups to write letters on the issue of changing the national system. The ridiculousness and absurdity were unmatched. Yuan Shikai was complacent, thinking that all the heroes in the world were in his shell, but he did not know that there were still many patriots in our party who raised their arms and shouted at the Huangpu River. Therefore, the Zhaohe Uprising's opposition to Yuan Shikai was also to destroy the decadent psychology of the scholars and officials of that time, not only to bomb away Yuan Shikai's body, but also to bomb away the ideas of power and tricks on which Yuan Shikai's spirit relied. This is two. From the situation at the time of the uprising, the soldiers who participated in the uprising, including myself, were only more than thirty, while the enemy's military strength was strong and the land and sea defenses were strict. The disparity between the few and the many, and the different strengths, meant that the failure was determined on the day of the uprising. However, the soldiers of the uprising strengthened their will, expanded their perseverance, and shouted loudly, hoping to die. This was because they were inspired by the Premier's decree that if they did not succeed, they would die for righteousness. This determination to die for righteousness was the most valuable treasure for saving the country and the people, and it could guide and develop the revolutionary forces latent in various inland areas, until Yunnan rose up and Yuan Shikai was overthrown. Therefore, the Zhaohe Uprising's opposition to Yuan Shikai was also to enlighten that the success of the revolution and the future of the Chinese nation standing independently in the world must all be due to the determination to die for righteousness. This is three. In summary, the Zhaohe Uprising had a significant impact on the party, the country, and the nation. Today, the national crisis is deepening, but fortunately we have Chiang Kai-shek, who still upholds the consistent spirit of leading the Zhaohe Uprising and makes unremitting efforts to save the country. May our countrymen never forget the historical lessons of the Zhaohe Uprising, tread on the blood of the martyrs, and advance at full speed under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek to promote our nation and save our country. Then the soldiers of the Zhaohe Uprising, whether alive or dead, will feel gratified.</p>

<h3>Zhang Fang Visited Various Circles Last Night to Report on the Henan Disaster and Request Relief</h3>
<p>Zhang Fang, Chairman of the Henan Relief Commission, and Chang Zizhen, a standing committee member, have come to Shanghai due to the severity of the disaster in Henan Province and the urgent need for relief. They specifically visited charitable organizations in the city to seek assistance. Last night, a special reception was held at the Hua'an Building for prominent figures from all walks of life in Shanghai. During the gathering, Mr. Zhang Fang reported on the disaster situation and relief measures. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Invited Guests</p>
<p>The invitees included Mayor Wu (represented by Li Dachao), Yang Xiaotian, Wang Yiting, Chu Huiseng, Wen Lanting, Gu Xinyi, Jiang Yiping, Lin Kanghou, Wang Boqi, Yu Qiaqing, Ye Gongchuo, Xue Dubi, Zhao Jinqing, Chen Guangfu (represented by Zhu Ruqian), Qu Wenliu, Huang Hanzhi, Song Hanzhang (represented by Ou Yongkang), Lu Liankui, Zhang Weiruo, Zhang Xiaolin, Xu Xinliu (represented by Zhang Yucheng), and more than seventy others.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang's Address</p>
<p>During the gathering, Zhang Fang reported, saying, "Due to geographical reasons, Henan Province has been suffering from either floods or droughts almost every year. We are not unfamiliar with the assistance from all sectors of Shanghai. On behalf of the people of Henan, I would like to express my deep gratitude. This year, Henan Province has suffered another drought, which is particularly severe in western Henan, affecting more than nine million people. The harvest of farmland is less than 10%. Although the province has actively handled the disaster relief, due to our weak strength, we have to rely on the rescue from enthusiastic people in the country. Henan Province occupies a very important position in the country. The disaster has not only caused extreme suffering to the people but also has a great impact on public security. Therefore, the province has formulated a concrete plan for disaster relief and hopes to implement it step by step with the assistance of all sectors in Shanghai."</p>
<p>Guests' Response</p>
<p>Mayor Li Dachao then delivered a speech of thanks on behalf of Mayor Wu, saying, "Henan occupies a very important position in history and geography. All sectors of Shanghai are very concerned about the severe disaster situation. We hope that the newly organized charitable organizations in the city will have concrete relief methods for the severe disaster in Henan and send personnel to express condolences. The government authorities also hope to allocate huge sums of money to fundamentally relieve the disaster in Henan. Finally, on behalf of everyone, I would like to thank the host for this grand banquet."</p>
<p>Severe Disaster Situation</p>
<p>According to another report, Henan Province has not rained for several months since this autumn. The autumn harvest has not yielded any grain, and spring wheat has not been sown. In the most severely affected areas of the province, about forty counties are in a state of destitution, which is extremely tragic. Mr. Zhang Fang has asked for leave from his post in Jiangxi to come to Shanghai to describe the disaster situation to various charitable organizations, seeking donations. He also carries a draft of a plan to be presented to the Executive Yuan for work-relief, which is comprehensive and thoughtful, and speaks to both immediate and long-term concerns. Its main points are (1) The fundamental solution to drought is to develop water conservancy; (2) Developing water conservancy can reduce droughts and floods; (3) Work-relief can ensure that funds are not wasted. In thousands of words, it is not only a plan for disaster relief in Henan Province but also a good strategy for local public security. After consultations in Shanghai, Mr. Zhang will go to Luoyang to meet with Chairman Chiang to personally report on the defense situation and disaster relief measures in Henan.</p>

<h3>Preparations for the Capital Express Are Complete and Can Be Implemented on Schedule</h3>
<p>The Jing-Hu and Hu-Hang-Yong Railway Bureau, in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Railways, will operate the "Capital Express" between Nanjing and Shanghai. All preparations are generally complete and will be officially implemented on schedule after several more solemn tests. The preparations and test run are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Historical Speed</p>
<p>Because the Beijing-Shanghai Railway's traffic equipment follows the old system, many signals and switches are not complete, so the traffic speed is extremely limited. The prescribed maximum speed between stations is 80 kilometers per hour. The prescribed maximum speed when passing facing switch points is 48 kilometers per hour. In addition, the entire line, except for the Shanghai to Nanxiang section, which has been double-tracked, is single-tracked. In addition, there are many stations, long stopping times, and many train times and meeting times, so it is not easy to shorten the travel time. In addition, there are level crossings with various highways along the line, and speeding is very likely to cause danger. However, since 1931, the travel time of each train on the Beijing-Shanghai line has been shortened again and again. Taking the special express train as an example, the revised timetable on March 1, 1933, was 7 hours and 48 minutes, the revised timetable in June was 6 hours and 50 minutes, the revised timetable on September 1 was 6 hours and 20 minutes, and the revised timetable on December 21, 1935, was 5 hours and 50 minutes. In May of this year, the Minister instructed that the research on shortening the travel time of the special express train between Beijing and Shanghai be continued, hoping to reduce the entire journey to four hours.</p>
<p>Three Test Runs</p>
<p>The bureau followed the ministry's instructions and first ordered Chief Wang of the Locomotive Department to use a Class C locomotive to haul six passenger cars for a test run on June 9th and 10th, stopping briefly at the four stations of Wuxian, Wuxi, Wujin, and Zhenjiang. The result was that the actual time required for the up train (from Shanghai to Beijing) was 251 minutes, and the actual time required for the down train (from Beijing to Shanghai) was 256 minutes. Later, Chief Wang of the Locomotive Department, Chief Huai Dehao of the Works Department, and Chief Xiao of the Traffic Department were ordered to conduct a joint test run on the 18th and 19th, using a Class C locomotive to haul six passenger cars, as before. The result was that the actual time required for the up train was 252 minutes, and the actual time required for the down train was 255 minutes. Summarizing the two test runs, the maximum speed between stations was approximately 80 kilometers per hour, and the speed when passing facing switch points was between 55 kilometers and 60 kilometers per hour. The stopping time at the four stations took approximately 18 minutes in total. However, it was summer at the time, so this was possible. If it were winter, it would be more difficult to burn the steam, and it would be necessary to provide warm steam to the passenger cars, and the restrictions of normal engineering would be unavoidable. Therefore, the actual travel time for the entire journey between Beijing and Shanghai would be more than this. On September 15, Chief Gan of the Locomotive Department and Chief Huai Dehao of the Works Department, together with the relevant personnel from the Beijing-Xixi-Shanghai sections, accompanied Dr. Lull and Von Rochow, German consultants of the Ministry of Railways, to conduct the third test run with a Class C locomotive hauling six passenger cars. The actual time required from Beijing to Shanghai was 259 minutes.</p>
<p>Improvement of Equipment</p>
<p>The results of the test run showed that it was still possible to shorten the travel time between Beijing and Shanghai. However, in order to actually operate passenger trains, it was necessary to first improve the traffic equipment. According to the estimate of the Works Department, if the standard of 4 hours for the entire journey is to be met immediately, the entire line must be uniformly relaid with heavy steel rails and new sleepers, and the bridges must be reinforced and new signals must be replaced. The total cost is approximately 4.29 million yuan in national currency. If the standard of 4 hours and 50 minutes is temporarily used, the required funds are approximately 750,000 yuan in national currency. It will still be handled in two parts. First, approximately 190,000 yuan in national currency is needed, which was approved by the Ministry of Railways on August 18. First, a trial run will be conducted according to the standard of 4 hours and 50 minutes. Therefore, all the improvement projects of traffic equipment will be started. The important ones are (1) Installation of warning signals, a total of 37 stations. (2) Installation of switch locks, all contracted by Xi Fuji. (3) Adding sleepers, the original 14 sleepers were padded for each steel rail, and now 2 are added to each, for a total of 56,700. (4) Paving the road, using 15,250 cubic meters of road bedding. In addition, the roadbed ditches were also improved and sorted out, using 9,000 cubic meters of sandstone and 2,875 cubic meters of sheet stone. As for the awarding of road signs at each station, it has been changed to an automatic method. In addition, one train of locomotives required is being reinforced and renovated. Class C locomotives are used, but the wheel diameter of the leading wheel of this type of locomotive is only 107 mm. After the speed is increased, there is a real fear that it will be easier to heat up, and it is planned to replace it with a roller bearing axle box. The vehicles include first-class passenger cars (with two dining cars, two second-class passenger cars, two third-class passenger cars, and one long car for heating, luggage, and mail). Each passenger car has been equipped with a heating oil tank to avoid burning the axles. Thirty-three new passenger car chassis have been purchased, and one train of the future "Capital Express" will use all the latest equipment passenger cars. In addition, the International Sleeping Car Company plans to add the latest European and American first-class parlor cars to the "Capital Express," which is under negotiation.</p>
<p>Prescribed Timetable</p>
<p>The "Capital Express" timetable has been submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval as follows: (1) The down train is train No. 1, departing from Nanjing Xiaguan Station at 17:30 every day, passing through Zhenjiang West Station, Wujin Station, Wuxi Station, and Wuxian Station, and arriving at Shanghai North Station at 22:20, the whole journey takes 4 hours and 50 minutes. (2) The up train is train No. 2, departing from Shanghai North Station at 8:00 every day, stopping at Wuxian Station, Wuxi Station, Wujin Station, and Zhenjiang West Station, and arriving at Nanjing Xiaguan Station at 12:48, the whole journey takes 4 hours and 48 minutes. That is, the "Capital Express" train will run from Shanghai to Nanjing every morning and return from Nanjing to Shanghai every afternoon.</p>
<p>Ticketing Method</p>
<p>The "Capital Express" will still charge special express ticket prices, and the principle is to ensure that each passenger has a seat. Therefore, the ticketing method has been separately determined and submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval. (1) Tickets for all classes of passenger cars on the "Capital Express" will be sold by the ticket office according to the number of seats. The detailed method is as follows: (A) The departure station of each train should reserve seats according to the number specified in the following table, to prepare for selling tickets to each stop along the way. (1) The up train North Shanghai Station reserves seats for each station: 4 first class, 8 second class, and 16 third class for Wuxian; 2 first class, 4 second class, and 8 third class each for Wuxi, Wujin, and Zhenjiang West. (2) The down train Nanjing Station reserves seats for each station: 4 first class, 8 second class, and 16 third class for Zhenjiang West; 2 first class, 4 second class, and 8 third class each for Wujin, Wuxi, and Wuxian. (B) Each stop along the way can sell tickets at any time according to the above regulations, but if the number of seats is sold out, it must wait for the train to depart from the previous station and notify the remaining vacant seats by telephone before selling tickets again. (C) The above reserved seats can still be sold when they do not hinder passengers boarding midway. (D) After each train departs, the departure station should notify the first stop by telephone of the details of the vacant seats of each class (the passengers arriving at the first stop and the seats reserved by the reservation are included in the vacant seats), so that the station can sell tickets according to the number (this number must not be less than the number reserved in item (A)). At the same time, the departure station will telegraph each station concerned with the details of the tickets of each class sold to each station. When the train departs from the first stop, the second stop will notify each station concerned with the details. In this way, each station can determine the number of tickets that can be sold. (2) Those who hold round-trip tickets, domestic tour tickets, or tickets purchased in advance, if taking the "Capital Express" train, must contact the ticket office to arrange seats. The date of the vehicle will be stamped by the ticket office and included in the number of tickets sold. (3) Once all the prescribed tickets have been sold out, each station should immediately stop selling tickets and hang a "Sold Out" sign. (4) Each travel agency is granted a certain number of seats for each class of vehicle according to the sleeper car method (but limited to the two departure stations). After inquiring about passengers taking the "Capital Express" train, it must be noted that the train number is stamped when selling tickets. The agency should notify the ticket office by telephone of the seat situation 10 minutes before departure so that statistics can be compiled. As for the three cases of traveling without a ticket, traveling beyond the station, and traveling beyond the class, tickets are still allowed to be supplemented in accordance with the regulations. However, the seat should first be given to passengers who purchased tickets at the station, so when there are no seats, they should still give way. The Ministry of Railways has been approved for record.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Approves the Shanghai Joint Association's Decision to Stop Industrial and Commercial Loans</h3>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' Joint Association received a reply from the Ministry of Finance, Qian Zi No. 11516, which stated: "The submission on November 17, 1936, requesting approval to postpone the closing of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee for adjustment purposes, has been received. The Ministry established the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee last year for the purpose of rescuing Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors. For a year, Shanghai's small industrial and commercial sectors have been revitalized through the Committee's loan rescue. Recently, the Committee has repeatedly stated that small industrial and commercial sectors in Shanghai in need of loans have mostly borrowed, those applying for loans recently mostly lack both assets and credit, and the market is gradually improving. Continuing would not be relevant to the market, and the Committee requests approval to close its operations, etc. The Ministry has verified that the situation is factual, and hereby orders the cessation of loans. This request should not be discussed further. This approval is dated December 3, 1936, and is signed by Minister Kong Xiangxi."</p>

<h3>Haichang Runs Aground; Heshun Breaks Chain and Loses Anchor</h3>
<p>Haichang Shipping Company's Haichang, a ship with a deadweight of 955 tons and a draft of 15 feet, is currently sailing to various northern ports. This time, it sailed from Yingkou to Tianjin and ran aground inside the Dagu Estuary due to heavy winds and waves, making it impossible to move. At that time, Datong and Heshun arrived. Haichang asked for help. Heshun had to throw anchor first in the heavy wind and waves, and planned to wait for the wind and waves to calm down before going to rescue. Unexpectedly, Heshun's anchor chain was broken by the wind and waves, and the anchor was also lost, making it impossible to tow Haichang. It had to return to Yingkou. Yesterday, it was confirmed that Haichang had hired another tugboat in Dagu to rescue the ship after the wind subsided.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Return Home, Scammed in Shanghai: Canadian Chinese Newspaper Records in Detail, Local Authorities Are Requested to Pay Attention</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to a letter from the Huashang Public Bus Company to this newspaper, it received a newspaper clipping from the Canadian New Republic Daily, detailing the scams suffered by overseas Chinese returning home in Shanghai, and attached the original newspaper. The excerpt is published as follows, hoping that those responsible for local security will pay attention.</p>
<p>Comrade Zhang Xinghui, former standing committee member of the Canadian General Branch and editor of the Xinghua Daily, after returning to China from last year, successively served as the director of the Overseas Department of Guangdong National University and a member of the General Branch's Guangdong Office. In recent years, he has devoted himself to education, providing much guidance to overseas Chinese children studying in Guangzhou. Mr. Zhang has been back in China for two years. Due to the restrictions of the Canadian immigration regulations, he could not stay in the country for a long time, so on the sixteenth of last month, he boarded the Japanese Empress ship from Hong Kong to return to Canada, and safely arrived in Vancouver three days ago to disembark. Mr. Zhang is now stationed at the Vancouver General Branch. According to Mr. Zhang, when the ship passed through Shanghai this time, many scammers on the pier pretended to be passengers on the same ship. When they saw overseas Chinese disembarking, they immediately approached them and took them to various places in the city for sightseeing, eating, and buying Beijing glue, Liushen Pills, ginseng shavings, etc. When ordering, they either pretended to forget to bring money or pretended that the money was not enough, put on an act, and then asked you to lend them money to pay, claiming that they would return the money after returning to the ship. At the same time, they handed over the purchased items to you for safekeeping to show their sincerity. After getting the money, they took the opportunity to leave. All those who accompanied them were deceived. Little did they know that the so-called Beijing glue was all cowhide glue, and the so-called Liushen Pills, ginseng shavings, etc., were all fake goods. Only afterwards did they realize their mistake, but it was too late. According to investigations, there were more than a dozen passengers on this trip who were scammed in the same way. Some were scammed out of two or three hundred yuan, and some were scammed out of dozens of yuan. There were big scams and small scams, depending on the amount of money you were carrying to determine their tactics. It is said that passengers on every ship have encountered similar scams in recent years, especially those returning from overseas. Even those who boasted on the ship that they were not easily fooled could not avoid being scammed once they landed in Shanghai. It must be known that the tricks of scammers in Shanghai are novel and numerous. Overseas Chinese passing through Shanghai, if they are not careful, will fall into their trap. Special caution is required. According to investigations, the overseas Chinese compatriots of Canadian nationality, Mr. Situ Tiehun, opened the Lingnan Hotel in Shanghai, Mr. Huang Zhongwen opened the Huashang Public Bus Company, and Mr. Li Mianchen opened a trust company. All of them are honest and reliable. When compatriots arrive in Shanghai, if they ask for guidance on everything, they will be happy to help, so that they can avoid being scammed by scammers.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Zhang Zhirang and Others Publish an Advertisement Urging Shi Liang to Surrender, Shi's Mother Faints and Vomits Blood, Her Siblings Also Urge Her to Return Quickly</h3>
<p>Ms. Shi Liang was arrested by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, together with the French Concession police, late at night on the 22nd of last month, because the authorities believed that she had political activities. She was handed over to the Third Branch of the Higher Court and ordered to be released on bail. Initially, the defending lawyers Zhang Zhirang and Tang Hao were responsible for releasing her on bail. Later, after leaving Shanghai for Suzhou, Shi saw a newspaper publishing the Shanghai Municipal Government's announcement of the reasons for the arrest of Shi and Shen Junru and seven others. Shi then fled and failed to appear in court. The Procuratorate of the Third Branch of the Higher Court has issued an arrest warrant and ordered the Procuratorate of the First Special Court to summon lawyers Zhang and Tang to court, ordering each of them to pay 500 yuan in cash as bail and to find and hand over Shi Liang within ten days. This was reported in this newspaper. Now it is reported that lawyers Zhang and Tang and Shi's family have been sending people to search in all directions for days, and [blank] letters to relatives and friends to inquire about her whereabouts, but they have not been able to find any trace of Shi. Shi's mother also fainted, vomited blood, and fell ill after receiving the letter of Shi's escape. Now that lawyers Zhang and Tang have heavy responsibilities and the court deadline is approaching, they published a notice in the newspaper yesterday urging Shi Liang to surrender immediately. Shi's younger siblings Shi Gongzai, Mengyun, and Shuzhi also published a notice in the newspaper yesterday, urging Shi Liang to surrender quickly to comfort their mother, because Shi's escape was causing their old mother great anxiety while she was sick. The two advertisements have already appeared on the front pages of yesterday's Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao and will not be repeated here. It is not known whether Shi Liang, after seeing the newspaper abroad, will surrender immediately.</p>
<h3>Dire Market Conditions Make Sustenance Difficult: Tai Feng Company Declares Bankruptcy Again, Court Ruling Approves and Announces</h3>
<p>*Shen Shi News* reports: The Tai Feng Canned Foods Company, previously unable to pay its debts due to losses, had once suspended operations. Later, it petitioned the court for a settlement ruling, which was approved, and it resumed business as usual.

<h3>Robbery of Wages at Shenxin No. 9 Factory: One Thief Shot and Captured, Box of Legal Tender Unharmed, Investigation and Patrol Prevented Great Loss, Captured Thief Severely Injured and Near Death, Another Thief Escaped Without a Trace</h3>
<p>At around 9:00 PM last night, while the Shenxin No. 9 factory on Tokyo Road, Macau Road, in Shanghai's west was distributing wages, two robbers, armed with pistols, who had infiltrated the factory by mingling among the workers, suddenly jumped out and snatched a briefcase containing 1,800 yuan in legal tender from the factory accountant's hand, attempting to escape. However, they were spotted by the factory's investigator and two Chinese police officers employed by the factory. The police opened fire, resulting in one thief being shot in the abdomen and captured, while the other thief escaped during the chaos. The stolen briefcase was completely recovered, and not a single cent was lost. Details follow:</p>
<p>Wage Distribution</p>
<p>The Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Mill at No. 140 Tokyo Road, Macau Road in Shanghai's west, routinely distributes wages to workers on the fourth evening of each month, totaling around two to three thousand yuan. Yesterday was another wage distribution day. Around 9:00 PM, the factory accountant, Mr. Gu, arrived with a briefcase containing 1,800 yuan in legal tender. Another 1,000 yuan was in his pocket, and he went to the factory to distribute the wages by name.</p>
<p>Briefcase Snatching</p>
<p>As Mr. Gu was about to open the briefcase and distribute the money, two robbers armed with pistols suddenly jumped out of the crowd of workers, approached Gu, and threatened him to remain silent. One robber snatched the briefcase from Gu's hand, while the other guarded the rear with a gun. They rushed out of the factory building, hoping to escape through the side gate.</p>
<p>Investigator's Intervention</p>
<p>Previously, several incidents of wage robberies had occurred in the Shenxin factories. To be cautious, the factory had paid special attention to security measures whenever wages were distributed. In addition to the ten Chinese police officers regularly employed to protect the factory, they also increased the number of investigators who guarded the factory day and night in shifts to ensure safety. As the two robbers were escaping the factory building, investigator Liu Chunlan, on the night shift, was patrolling with police officer No. 767.</p>
<p>One Thief Shot</p>
<p>Investigator Liu was shining a flashlight around while the police officer followed with his gun. They suddenly noticed two people fleeing in a panic, and one was carrying a briefcase containing wages. Realizing something was wrong, they shouted for them to stop, but the two abandoned the briefcase and fled for their lives. The police officer fired at them, hitting one of the robbers in the abdomen, who immediately fell to the ground and was captured.</p>
<p>Wages Recovered</p>
<p>The remaining robber took the opportunity to escape through the factory's back door without a trace. Investigator Liu Chunlan and the police officer immediately retrieved the briefcase and returned it to the accountant, Mr. Gu. After checking the contents of the briefcase, they found that not a single cent was missing. They immediately notified the Putuo Road police station, and the police chief dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene. The injured robber was taken by car to the Public Concession hospital for treatment. It is reported that his injuries are severe, and his life is in danger.</p>
<p>Post-Incident Investigation</p>
<p>After the police station's investigation, it was concluded that this robbery was a pre-planned, organized operation. The robbers must have had prior knowledge of the factory to infiltrate it so easily. Furthermore, the escape of the robber through the back door requires further investigation. The back door leads to Moganshan Road. It is usually locked, except when coal is being transported. The fact that the robbers had managed to open the door beforehand to create an escape route indicates that they must have had prior organization and a carefully laid plan.</p>
<h3>Female Workers Fight for Freedom of Marriage</h3>
<p>Residing at the Women's Relief Association, Father Accuses Her Lover</p>
<p>Teng Kaotang, from Yancheng, resides on Hengfeng Road in Zhabei. His eldest daughter, Jin Gui, is 20 years old and has been betrothed to someone. She and her sister work at the Yutai Silk Factory in Tanziwan. Recently, she fell in love with Yang Zizhen. Because her father disapproved, Jin Gui first hired lawyer Wu Kaisheng to publish a statement declaring her right to choose her own marriage. Fearing that her father would use his authority as a parent to force her, she also moved into the Women's Relief Association, declaring that she would fight for her freedom of marriage, or she would rather not leave. Teng Kaotang became extremely angry and hired a lawyer to sue Yang Zizhen in the district court for abduction, claiming that Yang first seduced his daughter and then, fearing the consequences, incited her to devise this plan as a form of resistance. Yesterday, Judge Shao Qinzhi of the court held a hearing. The defendant, Yang Zizhen, stated that he is from Nanjing, resides at No. 787 Jiaotong Road in Zhabei, and works as a foreman in an iron factory. He denied any adulterous activities. He also said that after the lawsuit, the plaintiff, along with Zhu Zigao and Guo Xiaochu, proposed a settlement, agreeing that neither party would sue. Witnesses Zhu Zigao and Guo Xiaochu testified that the settlement did occur, but the defendant instructed them to settle the matter at lawyer Wu Kaisheng's office. Finally, female lawyer Tu Kunfan, representing Jin Gui, stated that Jin Gui opposed the old marriage system, voluntarily moved into the Women's Relief Association, and hired her to appear in court. She would not return home unless the marriage arranged by her parents was dissolved and she was granted freedom. The judge ordered Jin Gui to appear in court at the next hearing, but she must not be forced to return home. The plaintiff agreed, and the judge ordered the defendant to post a 4,000 yuan bail and await further questioning.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Theft Case at Bank of Communications Warehouse Concluded</h3>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled</p>
<p>Regarding the theft of 15 large packages of white silk worth over 10,000 yuan from the second floor of the Bank of Communications warehouse at No. 865 Suzhou Road, which occurred on the evening of November 22nd at approximately 9:00 PM, the Hongkou Police Department, led by Chinese detective Feng Qishan, arrested the suspects Kong Qingfu and Liu Jianzhong from Zhenjiang, brokers Xiao Eryi and Xu Wenfu from Shaoxing, and Jin Binhan (detained at the Public Security Bureau) from Shaoxing, residing on Xinmin Road in Zhabei, as well as suspects Jia Shaoyun and Zhu Xiangfu from Zhenjiang, totaling seven individuals. Furthermore, they retrieved the stolen 15 large packages of white silk from the Japanese-owned Sato Yoko at No. 7 Wusong Road and brought them all back to the police station for questioning and detention at the First Special District Court. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the police department sent Kong Qingfu, Jin Binhan, and the others to the Third Criminal Court. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu from the Public Concession stated that after investigation, Jia Shaoyun and Zhu Fuxiang were found to be uninvolved and requested their release, which the court granted. Questioning Kong Qingfu and Liu Jianzhong, they confessed that the instigators were Tian Dalian, also known as Da Longbao, and two others who are on the run. They claimed that they were only lookouts. Xiao Eryi confessed that Jin Binhan came to him and said that there were 15 packages of white silk from Wuxi in Shanghai, selling for 800 yuan per package, and asked him to help sell them. He then entrusted Xu Wenfu to sell them to a Japanese, Ke Da, earning a commission of 5 yuan per package, unaware that they were stolen goods. Xu Wenfu's confession was the same, and he claimed that he was introduced to Ke Da by his Japanese friend, Fukuda. Jin Binhan confessed that the white silk came from his friend Liu Changlin and that the fake invoice from his Dacheng Silk Factory was also his. The remaining confessions were evasive. Xiao Eryi and Xu Wenfu hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend them. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that the investigation revealed that the suspects met at the Tongfangju teahouse on Gongguan Road in the French Concession approximately one month before the theft to discuss the plan. Judge Xiao Xieffen ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and scheduled the sentencing for a later date.</p>
<h3>Bigamy Case Unresolved, Another Charge of Assault, Zhu Yundi Accuses of Being Beaten, Zhuang Tinggui Fined 100 Yuan</h3>
<p>Zhuang Tinggui, from Wuxi, married Luo Lili (father's name Yingming), a woman of questionable character, after divorcing his wife Zhu Yundi. However, Zhu suddenly claimed that she had not divorced Zhuang and reported Zhuang and Luo to the police for bigamy. The First Special District Court has repeatedly summoned them, but the case has been adjourned due to the need to verify whether Zhu's signature on the divorce document is genuine. Zhuang was released on bail while awaiting trial. Zhuang and Zhu had a daughter named Yu Ying, now nine years old. After Zhuang and Zhu separated, Yu Ying was raised by Zhuang and studied at the Peicheng School on Haifang Road. On the 24th of last month, Zhuang and Zhu took Yu Ying from school without allowing her to return home. Zhuang first sent a servant to Zhu's residence at No. 1136 Xiaoshadu Road to retrieve Yu Ying, but she refused. Zhuang then went in person. Although Yu Ying was retrieved, a dispute arose between the father and Zhu. After Zhuang left, Zhu reported to the Putuo Road police station, claiming that she had been beaten by Zhuang, resulting in bruises on both arms. The police ordered detective Wu Hanzhang to summon Zhuang to the police station, but Zhuang vehemently denied beating Zhu. However, because Zhu insisted on pressing charges, the police requested a warrant from the First Special District Court and summoned Zhuang yesterday morning. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu charged Zhuang with assault under Article 277 of the Criminal Law. Subsequently, Zhuang and Zhu testified, explaining the events. When questioned, Zhuang firmly denied assaulting the plaintiff. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Pan Zhenyang sentenced Zhuang Tinggui for assault.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Promote One-Day Movement</h3>
<p>National Goods Factory Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Association, in order to continue promoting the one-day movement to donate to the anti-Japanese war effort, yesterday sent a letter to all member factories, stating: "The Standing Committee of the Executive and Supervisory Committees held a joint meeting on the 2nd of this month. The Standing Committee proposed a comprehensive plan for resisting aggression and saving the country. With bandits and puppet troops encroaching on our borders and foreign aggression intensifying, and since the recovery of Bailingmiao in Suiyuan province, reports indicate that the puppet troops are actively advancing, attempting to succeed (omitted). The people in our rear are donating funds to support the troops, a trend that is sweeping the nation. The patriotic fervor to resist aggression and save the country has shown a unified expression of the entire nation. How should we decide on a comprehensive plan to support the government, strengthen national defense, and achieve the goal of striving for strength, and how should we first raise funds to support the troops? Please decide." It was resolved that the military affairs in Suiyuan cannot be resolved in the short term. It is now resolved that the employees and workers of the association's member factories should continue to donate one day's income each month until the end of the war against the enemy. The factories are responsible for implementation and external publicity to reach all sectors of Shanghai and proceed uniformly. The record is on file. The case is hereby recorded and you are requested to check, implement it promptly, and report the implementation date for record. Sincerely, to all member factories, implementation methods: (1) Employees and workers should contribute one day's salary each month. The factory should contribute the total salary of all employees and workers for one day to the military expenses until the end of the war in Suiyuan. (2) Donors should send the donations to the National Bank for collection and register the bank receipt with the association for public announcement."</p>
<p>Tenant Association</p>
<p>Yesterday, letters were sent to the Citizens' One-Day Income Contribution to National Cause Promotion Association, the Purchase Aircraft to Celebrate Birthday Association, etc., regarding the fundraising method for the one-day movement in the real estate industry. The original letter stated: "This year is Generalissimo Chiang's 50th birthday, and the fundraising by all sectors to purchase aircraft is extremely enthusiastic. Subsequently, the Chamber of Commerce initiated the one-day movement, and the donation of funds has progressed even further. However, the real estate industry in this city, which owns huge assets, has not yet made any representation. Recently, reports have indicated that all sectors are eagerly hoping that the real estate industry will also rise up and participate in the one-day movement to jointly overcome national difficulties. Our association expresses its utmost sympathy. However, the fundraising method must be appropriate. According to our association's limited understanding, we propose that your association and others be responsible for leadership, designate a bank for payment, and have all tenants in the city pay one day's rent. Tenants can deduct it in the payment of the monthly rent by presenting the bank receipt. The bank should announce it in the newspaper every day to show credibility. If this method is revised and implemented, our association will persuade the tenants to comply. We hereby request that you check and reply."</p>
<h3>Red Swastika Society Raises Funds to Relieve Disaster in Suiyuan</h3>
<p>Madam Liu Generously Donates</p>
<p>With the outbreak of war in northern Suiyuan, the general association of the Red Swastika Society of Jin, Chahar, and Sui has organized two teams to go to the war zone to provide relief to wounded soldiers and civilians. The Red Swastika Societies of Southeast China convened a meeting of representatives from various societies yesterday, including President Xiong Xiling of the general association and representatives from branch societies in various provinces and counties in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Fujian. Xiong Xiling was elected as chairman, and Hua Wenchuan and Tao Xishan were elected as vice-chairmen. They discussed important relief matters and resolved to follow the resolutions of the general meeting and raise 50,000 yuan from the Red Swastika Societies in various provinces in Southeast China to relieve the disaster caused by the war, and that various societies should do their best to raise funds to ensure a continuous supply. The eight relief teams pre-organized in the Southeast region are actively purchasing medicines and equipment for use. It is also reported that Madam Liu Huixing generously donated 500 yuan worth of gold jewelry to be used for the relief of wounded soldiers and refugees. In addition, Ms. Yang Shenfang donated a large amount of gauze and cotton wool, Dr. Zang Boyong donated 40 sets of cotton clothing, and Mr. Ma Ziqiang donated two large bottles of Huatuo's Refined Gold and Huatuo Powder, wound healing medicines.

<h3>Detained Rice Boats Not Released Yesterday, Wusong River Traffic Blocked</h3>
<p>*Dagon News* reports: The rice markets in the Zhabei, Xinzha Bridge, and North Suzhou River areas of this city have been cut off from supplies because rice boats from Wuxi, Changshu, Kunshan, Suzhou, Jiangyin, and other inland areas being transported to Shanghai have been detained by the Jiwangmiao police station in Jiading County. It has been three days and they have not been released, causing a sudden disruption of rice supply. All shops uniformly closed their doors yesterday morning, awaiting a resolution. The Wusong River, from Huangdu in the east to Beixinjing, is shallow and crowded with parked rice boats, completely blocking traffic.</p>
<p>Limited Rice Reserves</p>
<p>Due to the influence of the Shanghai North Rice Market, rice prices in the South Rice Market suddenly soared. The prices of rice in the upper and middle grades uniformly rose by 2 to 4 jiao the day before yesterday. When trading opened yesterday morning, prices rose again by more than 2 jiao. The prices of local rice have also risen. According to a reporter's investigation, the rice reserves in Shanghai, in the warehouses and shops in Pudong in the south of the city, are only over 200,000 dan. The reserves of milled rice in the north of the city are less than 10,000 dan. If the detained rice boats are not released, there will be panic in Shanghai's food supply, and prices will likely skyrocket.</p>
<p>General Meeting</p>
<p>The Bean and Rice Trade Association is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting of all rice merchants in the city at 2:00 PM today at Cuixiu Hall on Fuyou Road to discuss countermeasures. Representatives will be sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Department of Civil Affairs, together with representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, the Shanghai North Rice Merchants Association, and the Changshu Association, to request consideration and demand immediate release in order to maintain the food supply of Shanghai citizens.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Market Continues to Rise Yesterday, Exchange Establishes Supplementary Trading Measures</h3>
<p>The flour and wheat market in this city has recently been manipulated by speculators and affected by the current situation, resulting in severe fluctuations. Yesterday, the flour and wheat market continued to rise. In order to stabilize market transactions, the Flour Exchange, in addition to the regulations stipulated in the original operating rules, established supplementary measures. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Exchange Notice</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Flour Exchange issued a notice to stabilize market transactions, stating: "For the purpose of announcement, the shareholders' meeting on August 30th of this year entrusted the board of directors to handle the case of canceling public warehouses proposed by shareholders Zhang Weiyun and others. After soliciting opinions from various parties, the board of directors decided to continue to operate in accordance with Article 71 of the exchange's operating rules from January 26th, and to set additional supplementary measures as follows. Special announcement: (1) The delivery of forward contracts shall still be governed by Article 71 of the exchange's operating rules, but the exchange shall decide one month before the daily delivery whether the delivery on that day shall be applicable to the warehouse receipts of the warehouses prepared or designated by the exchange, or to the factory warehouse receipts, and announce it in the market. (2) For those delivered by factory warehouse receipts decided by the exchange, the buying broker shall still pay the price according to the exchange's usual practice (ten-day bank drafts or bank drafts approved by the exchange) and hand the factory warehouse receipts to the buying broker, who shall pick up the goods within ten days. The selling broker shall hand the factory warehouse receipts to the exchange, which shall issue a receipt and pay the delivery money on schedule within ten days. (3) The buying broker shall clear all the goods within ten days from the date of delivery of the factory warehouse receipts obtained at delivery. The exchange shall not be liable for any consequences if the goods are not delivered on time. (4) For those decided by the exchange to be delivered by the warehouse receipts of the self-provided or designated warehouses, the payment of money and goods shall still be handled in accordance with the regulations in the latter paragraph of Article 71 of the exchange's operating rules."</p>
<p>Yesterday's Rising Trend</p>
<p>Yesterday, the prices of flour in various months all rose. The recent market price broke the record of four yuan again, reaching four yuan and four fen, while the distant price reached four yuan and five jiao. This rising trend is indeed rare in recent years. As for wheat, due to buying by merchants and chasing by short sellers, the rising trend did not subside. The market price at the close was one jiao higher than the day before. Due to price limits, it could not go higher, so it is expected that it will be difficult to see a low price in the short term.</p>

<h3>College Student Dances with Woman, Steals Camera, Because Dancer Will Soon Give Birth, Camera Was Stolen and Pawned for Money</h3>
<p>Zhang Baocheng, a fifth-year student at Soochow Law School, founded a Guoguang News Agency at No. 8 Xiangkang Lane, Meibaige Road. On the 25th of last month, Wu Guoxiong (24 years old), a former second-year student from Soochow, visited Zhang Baocheng. Zhang treated Wu generously as a former classmate, and they had a long conversation. For two consecutive days, until 3:50 PM on the 27th, Wu visited Zhang again. At that time, Zhang was out, and Zhang's classmate, Zhou Zhen, entertained him. Later, Zhou had to go out as well, so he asked Wu to stay temporarily in the office outside the bedroom, and locked the bedroom door. Unexpectedly, Wu Guoyou had a sudden change of heart. Seeing that no one was in the room, he used an iron tool to pry open the lock of the room and entered, stealing a camera worth 150 yuan, and fled without a trace. When Zhang Baocheng returned home and discovered that the camera was missing, he began to investigate. Later, according to the tea boy Ni Baozhang, he saw Wu Guoxiong carrying a black box in the alley when he returned to the agency that day. Only then did he realize that Wu had done it and immediately reported it to the Xinzha police station. As late as 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, Zhang Baocheng learned that Wu Guoxiong was currently in the Huaan Insurance Company on Jing'an Temple Road, so he informed the police to arrest him. Unexpectedly, Wu found out and took the opportunity to escape. Around 12:00 PM the night before, Zhang learned that Wu lived with a certain dancer at No. 60, Lane 7, Chengdu Road, so he reported to the police station and dispatched detectives to arrest Wu. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Dayin prosecuted him for theft under Article 321, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law and presented the case. Zhang Baochong also testified to the above situation. The defendant Wu Guoxiong confessed, "I used to work at the Shanghai Trust Company, and I went to Soochow Law School at night, but then I dropped out. Since last month, I have been working as a street vendor for the Continental News Agency. This time, because the dancer I love is pregnant and about to give birth, I was in financial difficulties and resorted to this tactic. I have now pawned the camera at Chengan Pawnshop at No. 108 Wusong Road and spent all 43 yuan I received. Now the dancer has also come to court and is asking for forgiveness." After the interrogating judge verified the confession, he ordered the defendant to be detained and await the rescheduled hearing next Wednesday.</p>

<h3>Two Theaters Today Screen Films to Celebrate the Dedication of Aircraft</h3>
<p>The central photography department's short film dedicated to celebrating the donation of aircraft was brought to Shanghai by a member sent by the central propaganda minister a month ago and handed over to various theaters for screening. It has been a long time since then, and the Da Guangming and Nanjing theaters have not yet screened it. Section Chief Wu of the Central Propaganda Department therefore came to Shanghai in person to inquire. After being contacted by Section Chief Li Dachao of the municipal government, it is now heard that the Nanjing and Da Guangming theaters have decided to add the film to their day and night shows today (the 5th), while the Da Shanghai and International Thai theaters will screen it tomorrow (the 6th).</p>
<h3>Wu Qinmu Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>Wu Qinmu from Wujiang specializes in painting. He once stayed at Xu Qi Pang's residence, observing famous paintings for more than a year. His works all capture the spirit of the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties. Now, he is exhibiting more than 100 of his finest works at the Hushe Hall at the intersection of Beijing Road and Guizhou Road, scheduled for December 5th to 7th for two days. Those who are interested in calligraphy and painting can feast their eyes.</p>
<h3>Yang Weiquan's Calligraphy and Painting Are Increasing in Value</h3>
<p>The "Jinhui Dui" (pile of brocade ashes) painted by famous calligrapher and painter Yang Weiquan are exquisitely and realistically depicted. Famous figures of the time all praised them. The original price was 10 yuan per foot, and the fan face was 10 yuan per piece. In the year of Guiyou, it was increased by 20%, and in the year of Bingzi, it was increased by another 20%. However, those who love his works are still willing to pay heavily and compete to ask for paintings. This is because Mr. Yang never perfunctorily brushes off his work due to being too busy. Each painting takes five or six days, or more than ten days of work, and he must imitate it to the fullest extent so that the requesters are satisfied. Therefore, paper pieces are piled up like a mountain and he is overwhelmed. It is said that he is still burying himself in work all day long to meet the demand.</p>
<h3>Baby Face Lives Up to Its Name</h3>
<p>"Baby Face," sold by the French-Chinese Pharmacy, is the only skin-beautifying and moisturizing agent, and can be called the leading cosmetic product.

The name "Baby Face" truly lives up to its name.</p>

<h3>Lying About Death to Obtain Compensation, Li Bingchang Sentenced, Li Detained for 50 Days, His Wife Sentenced to 30 Days</h3>
<p>Li Bingchang (also known as Li Benchu), the owner of the Liyuan Money Shop in Huyang County, Guangdong, and a native of Shantou, took out a life insurance policy with American United Life Insurance Company for HK$50,000 in May 1932. However, Li had recently suffered business losses and the money shop had closed down. He came up with a bizarre idea and colluded with his wife, Li Liang Zhiying, to write a letter to United Life Insurance Company stating that Li Bingchang had committed suicide by drowning and demanding compensation of HK$50,000. After United Life Insurance Company learned that he was not actually dead, it sent a telegram to Li's family asking them to come to Shanghai for a face-to-face discussion. Li Liang Zhiying then came to Shanghai with her fellow villager Zhang Zhengde and stayed at the New Asia Hotel. Meanwhile, United Life Insurance Company's investigation revealed that Li Bingchang was hiding in Room 17 of the Lingnan Hotel on Wuchang Road. Based on this information, they reported to the General Police Department, which sent detectives to arrest Li Bingchang and Zhang Zhengde at the New Asia Hotel, and handed them over to the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted them for fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Code. After an interrogation, the defendants were ordered to appear in court again on another day. Yesterday morning, under the continued interrogation of the three defendants by Judge Pan Zhenyang in the Criminal Court, Li Bingchang was sentenced to 50 days of detention for attempted joint fraud, Li Liang Zhiying was sentenced to 30 days of detention, and Zhang Zhengde was acquitted.</p>
<h3>General Overview of Shanghai's Industrial and Commercial Changes in September 1936 (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Edited by China Credit Information Agency</p>
<p>(Shanghai's Industrial and Commercial Overview - No. 39)</p>
<p>(3) Qinglian Pavilion Teahouse Transfer - This teahouse, which has eyes above it, has long been well-known. Since the old site was renovated and moved to the intersection of Hubei Road and Fuzhou Road, the owner of the building, Mr. Sun Furen, has actively reorganized it, and it has a completely new atmosphere. The interior is divided into a shopping mall and a small Guanghan theater. Recently, due to the impact of the depression, business has been sluggish. Mr. Sun has no intention of operating, so he transferred all the property, decoration, and trademarks to Dan Gui Company for operation, and added a note to show the distinction.</p>
<p>(4) Mother's Heart Hospital Opens - This hospital was founded by Mr. Lu Bohong, a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist in this city. Mr. Lu realized that the Zhabei area is vast, with a large number of residents, especially the poor. However, there are not many charitable hospitals suitable for them, and there are even fewer large-scale ones. Therefore, he opened up more than 20 acres of land near Niuqiao on Baoxing Road and started construction in early March of this year. The funds were from the gifts received by Mr. Lu during his 60th birthday celebration the year before last as a foundation, and he also received more than 2,000 yuan in donations from the municipal government and various charities. It was completed at the end of August. It is said that the total construction cost reached 70,000 yuan, and the internal equipment is complete and the scale is grand. It opened on the 26th of this month. It is said that the monthly recurring expenses are about 1,500 yuan or more, which are borne by Mr. Lu, the municipal government, the Nanshi Water and Electricity Company, the Huashang Tram Company, and the Inland Tap Water Company.</p>
<p>(5) Lido Company Founded - This company was converted from the residence of the wealthy Shanghai businessman Gan Yize. It includes a dance hall, a night garden, a hotel, and a swimming pool, with a large scope. The manager is Mr. Ma Jigan, who is good at dancing and has unlimited prospects.</p>
<p>In the manufacturing industry category, the number of new creations this month is the same as last month, and the number of closures is one less than last month. The general situation is very similar to last month, but the cotton textile industry has slightly improved due to the bumper cotton harvests in various places this year, the gradual decline in cotton prices, and the gradual increase in sales and prices of cotton yarn. The more important changes are described below.</p>
<p>(1) Hengfeng Textile Bureau Announces Resumption of Operations - This bureau is considered the originator of the textile industry in China. It was founded by Mr. Nie Yuntai as a sole proprietorship and was established in the sixteenth year of Guangxu, which is 46 years ago. The total capital is 1.15 million yuan and it is a limited company. The current factory director is Mr. Nie Lusheng. It has 514,506 yarn spindles, 611 looms, 800 horsepower of electricity, 100 horsepower of steam power, more than 3,300 workers, and more than 150 employees. It uses 76,000 dan of cotton and produces 22,000 bales of yarn and 10,360 square yards of cloth annually. The factory covers an area of more than 40 acres. Because of its novel architecture and scientific management, it has made great contributions to the history of the textile industry in China. At the beginning of the bureau's business, its operations gradually developed. Later, the outbreak of the European War brought the factory a lot of profit. Therefore, the scope was increasingly expanded. In addition to adding a second factory and a cloth factory, Mr. Nie also founded the Da Zhonghua Yarn Factory in Yunzaobang. Unexpectedly, the European War ended, British exchange rates rebounded, and foreign yarn was dumped. The factory suffered a blow and was almost shaken. I had to transfer the Da Zhonghua Factory to Yong'an Textile Company, and with the vigorous assistance of the banking community, it was finally saved from danger. In the following years, business was sluggish. It was not until 1925 that it saw a turnaround. It made a profit again between 1930 and 1931. However, since then, due to the depression in the market, purchasing power has become increasingly weak, and foreign goods have been dumped cheaply, it has fallen back into losses. It has tried its best to support itself for three years, with debts reaching more than 3 million yuan. Mr. Nie believes that if this continues, the future may be unimaginable. Therefore, he stopped work this spring, and it has been more than half a year. After autumn, due to the bumper cotton harvests in various places, the future of the yarn industry has shown a turnaround again. Therefore, after discussions between Zhejiang Xingye and Mr. Nie's plan, it was decided to lease the factory unconditionally to China Cotton Industry Trading Company for operation, for a period of three years. Mr. Nie resigned as the company's auditor and the consultant of China Cotton Company. Hu Huan of China Cotton Company will serve as the manager, and Wang Fuli will be hired as the associate and chief engineer. As for the company's previous debts to Zhejiang Xingye, interest payments will be suspended during the lease period. If there is a business profit, 5% will be taken as Mr. Nie's business micro-profit, and the remaining 95% will be split between Zhejiang Xingye China Cotton Company. If there is a loss, the China Cotton Company will be fully responsible. After the three parties signed an agreement, work was resumed on the 27th of this month. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>How to Be a Revolutionary Woman?</h3>
<p>— Tong Yizhen</p>
<p>For thousands of years, we have lived in darkness, political oppression, social contempt, and the shackles of Confucian etiquette such as "Women are not allowed to join political associations," "What do women and children know," and "A woman without talent is virtuous," which simply suffocated us. Since the vigorous "May Fourth Movement," it has directly set off the revolutionary wave of our "Women's Movement," shouting loudly for "freedom and equality!" But now it has been almost twenty years, what are our achievements? Alas! Many of our female compatriots are still bound in layers of darkness. In this view, I believe that we should be a revolutionary woman, embracing the ambition of "If I don't go to hell, who will?" to save them in the darkness. So how can we be a revolutionary woman? In my opinion, we should strive to implement several revolutionary conditions:</p>
<p>(1) Ideological Revolution - In ancient times, we have always been "governing the inner circle." Except for daily life and family duties, we don't ask or care about anything. I ask, if we continue like this, when will there be a day for us to "come out of the mountain"? The Western philosopher said, "Thought is the mother of enterprise." That's right, if we want to be revolutionary women and do a great cause, we should start with ideology. We must strive to break the corrupt ideas of the past few years and cultivate transcendent ideas.</p>
<p>(2) Revolution of Will - Our will is much weaker than others. After being tempted by the outside world, it is easy to change our original intentions, blindly follow, and be controlled by others. This is so dangerous! If we want to be revolutionary women, we must temper our will. Will can hold everything in our future. We must fill ourselves with courage and develop an indomitable perseverance to fight the environment!</p>
<p>(3) Habit Revolution - Our popular common problems, such as luxury, vanity, stinginess, jealousy, etc., are all the worst habits. Habits are the original elements of character, and these must be intentionally avoided. The habits we need are the spirit of enterprise and the魄strength of creation!</p>
<p>Female compatriots! Unite, we want to be revolutionary women. Vainly shouting slogans is useless. We should do it truly and practically! Especially in this extraordinary period, we must all embrace the determination of "If the country is not a country, how can there be a home?" and the悲愤 sorrow and indignation of "If the skin does not exist, what will the hair cling to?" We must work hard and revolutionize for ourselves and for the country!</p>
<h3>Japanese Women Residing in Our Country</h3>
<p>— A Single Hair</p>
<p>Although the number of Japanese residing in our country is not large, the composition is quite complex. Now, as the diplomatic relations between the two countries are being adjusted and unfortunate incidents are occurring in various places, we should have a special understanding of the Japanese women residing in the interior of our country.</p>
<p>Japanese women residing in our country can be roughly divided into three types. The first type is the family members of Japanese officials stationed in China or the families of large Japanese merchants. This category is small in number, usually lives a secluded life, and is not easy to approach. Their stay in our country is temporary, and they will return to their country in a short period. The second type is the women we often see, who are the families of legitimate small merchants. They themselves run shops, selling and managing, and are in a semi-permanent residence state. The third type is those who are not engaged in legitimate occupations or are engaged in secret professions. They can make their home anywhere, traveling between China and Japan without a fixed period of stay.</p>
<p>Women from the Kanto region around Tokyo are generally slender, with mostly oval faces. When they come to China, they are mostly the wives and daughters of officials and capitalists, with a high level of education and a great respect for their own personality. The Japanese women in the Hongkou area of North Sichuan Road in Shanghai, with high hairstyles and wearing wooden clogs, are the families of small merchants. After living here for a long time, they can speak a few words of Chinese, or at least understand Shanghai dialect. They are larger in stature than Tokyo people, with rough, dark skin and high cheekbones. These are people from Kyushu, Kobe, and Yokohama who could not develop in their own country and followed their husbands to our country to do business. If they have a comfortable life in our country and have no attachment to their hometown, they may never return to their homeland. They are familiar with the psychology of our people, and are very polite in their interactions with Chinese men and women, just as they treat their compatriots in their own country. Especially in receiving customers, their hospitality is even more skillful than that of our merchants. Although their level of knowledge is not high, their love for their country and their hometown is extremely strong. Although they live in our country, they still do not buy Chinese goods, and often live in groups. Therefore, wherever Japanese people live, there are Japanese shops selling Japanese goods. They only want to buy Japanese goods in Japanese shops and are unwilling to buy Japanese goods in Chinese shops. After giving birth to children in our country, they send them to relatives in Japan to receive education in their homeland after they graduate from elementary school. Therefore, unless they marry Chinese people, the children of ordinary merchants will never be assimilated by the Chinese.</p>
<p>Japanese women who are rootless and do not engage in legitimate occupations are especially numerous in Beijing and Shanghai. Their professions ultimately include dancers, prostitutes, masseuses, coffee girls, and wine servers. Their companions include merchants, soldiers, sailors, and vagrants, a complete mixture. Therefore, Japanese women who are immersed in secret lives all day long have an alluring and romantic attitude that is immediately recognizable. There are also those among our people who enjoy low-level entertainment, and it is very easy for unfortunate incidents to occur, which is harmful to international relations. Older women whose beauty and talent have declined have no choice but to engage in illicit activities to make a living. The Japanese magazine "Talk" in Tokyo reported that smuggling in North China and private buying of silver dollars in Shanghai were initially started by middle-aged, unscrupulous women. For the sake of national relations, women in both countries should respect themselves and others, and promote friendship and goodwill with each other.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Roosevelt</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Mrs. Roosevelt, the wife of the American President, will continue her life as the First Lady in the White House for another four years due to Mr. Roosevelt's re-election this year. Mrs. Roosevelt has many admirable words and deeds in her past four years in the White House that are worth mentioning. Here are some excerpts:</p>
<p>Although the Mrs. Roosevelt is the First Lady of the White House, she does not reduce her social engagements because of her high position. She still visits her female friends from before she became famous. In the White House, there are several hostel-like rooms specially set up for her female friends to come and stay for a short time. Therefore, her female friends, when they come, always stay for one or two weeks. Sometimes, when Mrs. Roosevelt is talking happily with her female friends, she will not return to her own bedroom and will spend the night in the same room with her female friends. If her female friends hold a banquet and invite Mrs. Roosevelt to participate, unless she is assisting her husband in handling important matters and is really unable to spare the time, she always personally attends the banquet, regardless of the cold or heat, distance or proximity. In January of last year, a female friend of hers in New York passed away, and the funeral was scheduled for 3:30 in the afternoon. Coincidentally, she was too busy to spare the time on the morning of that day, so she had to take a plane in the afternoon, carrying a wreath, and rush to New York to participate in the funeral. The weather that day was extremely bad, with wind and rain, but Mrs. Roosevelt did not stop her trip because of this. Her friendships are generally like this.</p>
<p>Liking children is one of Mrs. Roosevelt's habits. In the past four years, she has participated in the graduation ceremonies of elementary schools and awarded diplomas and prizes more than twenty times. She has participated in national children's sports meets more than ten times. She has participated in various amusement activities held by childcare organizations more than twenty times. She has traveled as far south as Florida and as far west as Arizona. This is a high record that previous First Ladies have never had in expressing their love for children. On Children's Day of the year before last and Christmas of last year, Mrs. Roosevelt took the opportunity of being at the White House to entertain children, preparing refreshments and toys, and having a great day. She is also very willing to help women. If there is an unemployed woman with a skill, she only needs to write a letter to Mrs. Roosevelt, and Mrs. Roosevelt will pay attention to it and look for a suitable position. It is said that in these four years, on average, a total of 354 to 400 people are introduced to positions that match their skills each year. Mrs. Roosevelt always replies to letters of complaint from old women who are poor and helpless, and comforts them, or sends letters to the state government to ask for help. Mrs. Roosevelt currently holds the position of writer for several publishing houses, and the income from her remuneration is entirely donated to several childcare organizations in the country. At the same time, the income from his real estate stocks is entirely donated to the old women in the country who have complained to her. It is said that in these four years, under these two items, a total of about 200,000 yuan is donated each year.</p>
<p>Mrs. Roosevelt is very proficient in cooking, and she also likes to do it herself. For daily banquets with guests and friends, half of the dishes are cooked by herself. If there is a large banquet, at least she has to make a dish herself to entertain the guests. The kitchen in the White House was built in 1887, but in 1933, Mrs. Roosevelt gathered several engineers to renovate it and create a state-of-the-art kitchen. From this point, we can also see Mrs. Roosevelt's attention to cooking.</p>
<p>These are the outlines of the life of the First Lady of the United States. It is said that in the past four years in the White House, Mrs. Roosevelt has lost about fifteen pounds. The wrinkles on her face have also deepened a lot. But her spirit is still so vigorous, because Mrs. Roosevelt's body is very healthy. It is said that in the past ten years, she has not been sick and bedridden for a single day.</p>
<h3>Women's Issues in Folk Songs</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>"Little Sister Er, pushes a wheelbarrow to the north, can't push it, Fourth Brother sends her, sends her home, sits down and spins cotton, spins cotton until noon, mother-in-law gives her a bran cornbread, takes a bite, so sad, jump into the well, the well is too deep, jump into the river, the river is too high, clings to the riverbank and cries to the heavens!"</p>
<p>"The sun comes out with a pot of flowers, the cruel mother-in-law knows how to manage the house, when the daughter-in-law comes to cook, she grabs a handful of millet, first starts the fire, then cuts the vegetables, and quickly cooks the rice. The father-in-law and mother-in-law scoop thick rice, the daughter-in-law drinks vegetable soup, miserable, miserable, it's hard to be a daughter-in-law!"</p>
<p>"Pounding cloth stones, banging, I'll give you sixteen taels, ten fathers-in-law and one mother-in-law, ten sisters-in-law watching over me: watching me so that my toes don't touch the ground, taking a basket to fetch water, my feet are small, thin, and thin, my little feet are so painful, grasshoppers bite, chirp, chirp, I miss home, who knows? Lower my head and see the small gate of my mother's house; bend my waist and see the locust tree of my mother's house."</p>
<p>"Young girl, watch the imperial fair, walk a little, kneel a little; go home and cover yourself with a quilt, father-in-law beats, mother-in-law scolds, sister-in-law comes to pull your hair, pull one strand, ignore it, pull two strands, it hurts, pull three strands, jump into the river, the river is far away, jump into the well, the well is deep, clinging to the wellhead and scolding the matchmaker, matchmaker, you make money, I suffer, a gust of wind blows me back to my mother's house, look at my mother, leaning on a cane; look at my grandfather, wearing broken shoes; look at my sister, folding a quilt; look at my sister-in-law, folding a jacket; look at my brother, eating steamed buns and not letting me have any; cruel parents don't chase the dog, tear my skirt and bite my hand, angry young lady, hurry away."</p>
<p>The above four folk songs are very popular in northern China. In these four folk songs, we can consistently see the truth of the disharmony between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, and the pain of marriage and freedom. Those who care about women's happiness and lead the women's movement need to discuss this issue.</p>
<p>In the author's humble opinion, the fundamental problem to be solved in the above question lies in the lack of universal education for women. On the one hand, we hope that the education authorities will actively promote universal education so that everyone, regardless of gender, has the opportunity to receive a considerable education. At the same time, we especially hope that the leaders of the general women's circles will put forward this issue for research, set out a suitable solution, and conduct a large-scale publicity and campaign to attract the attention of the general public. Only then will there be a possibility of a solution. Such is my humble opinion, I wonder what the reader thinks?</p>

<h3>Ms. Li Xiaqing Talks About Saving the Country Through Aviation</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Building an Air Force is the Only Way to Gain a Foothold in the Future World. Prepare Early and Train Highly Skilled Personnel.</p>
<p>Saving the country through aviation is the unanimous call of compatriots across the country. At this time when the border bandits are tense and the war of resistance is fierce, enemy planes are rampant in our airspace, making us feel that aviation is truly the only weapon to save the country. In the past three or four years, with the enthusiastic promotion of the government and the people, aviation in our country has achieved considerable results, but it is still far behind the great powers. From now on, we must do our best to promote it, so that we can increase the strength of our national defense. According to the current situation, our country cannot supply itself with aircraft, talents cannot be universally trained, and gasoline cannot be mined in large quantities, which are indeed great obstacles to the development of the aviation industry. If we have a solution to these three items, then we can assert that China's aviation will not lag behind others. Here, focusing on the second item, the training of aviation talents is much more difficult than other technologies, and there are particularly few learners. In recent years, due to the deepening national crisis, young patriotic people have been more enthusiastic in joining the air force, which is a good phenomenon that promotes the prosperity of the country through adversity. However, there are still very few women learning aviation. Therefore, I believe that women learning aviation are outstanding heroines. A few months ago, after publishing an article on Yang Jinxun's aviation life, more than a dozen young women wrote to inquire about the content of the Flying Club, which is very interesting. Therefore, today I will introduce Ms. Li Xiaqing to the readers, and I believe it will arouse the deep sympathy of everyone.</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Ms. Li is from Guangdong. She studied at St. Stephen's School in Hong Kong in her childhood, and later entered the Zhongxi Girls' High School in Shanghai. (She once worked as an actress in her father's Minxin Film Company, under the alias Li Dandan, but now she says that this is not worth recalling.) In 1928, she went to study in England for two years, and then went to Switzerland, where she lived in Geneva for four years. Half of the time was spent studying civil aviation at the Crendmerville Flying Club. After graduating, she went to the Boeing Flying School in the United States to study. The school is the most famous civil aviation school in the United States. Among the 150 students, she was the only woman. The curriculum was very heavy, from 8:00 in the morning to 5:00 in the evening, all focused on academic and technical subjects. Manufacturing, assembly, repair, and driving were all done. Astronomy, geography, radio, and other subjects were all available. Blind flight, dangerous flight, radio command, parachute, and other latest flying techniques were all learned. She said: "I have obtained two Swiss flight licenses and one American license. After returning to China, I passed the central examination and was also issued a license. Some people outside say that I cannot fly, which is really a joke. Since there is evidence of the fact, it seems unnecessary to argue more.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>I asked her about the motivation for studying aviation. She said: "I like sports, which is more interesting than burying myself in front of the window. The "1918" and "January 28" incidents happened one after another. I lived far away in Switzerland and was greatly stimulated. Thinking of the enemy planes being so brutal, if we women want to serve the country, the only way is to study aviation. It is very similar to my own physical strength and interests. One is to show women's self-awareness and be able to advance with the times, and the other is that such a large motherland has no aviation construction (speaking four years ago), how can it gain a foothold in the scientific world? In fact, the navy is not easy to expand, and the army cannot exert its power without the cooperation of the air force. With such a long coastline, there is a danger of being controlled by the enemy at any time. Only by building an air force can we confront them with aircraft. If we women take the lead in advocating it, men will definitely not be willing to fall behind. So I strengthened my will."</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>"What are the numbers of female pilots in Europe and the United States, and which women are in China's aviation industry?" I thought she would know, so I asked this question. She thought for a while; "There are very few women in Europe and the United States who have contributed to the aviation industry, but the number of people engaged in learning is increasing day by day. There are no accurate statistics on the number of people. As far as I know, all major cities in the United States have Ninety-nine Clubs, (Ninety-nine club) membership is limited to women who have obtained a pilot's license. There are as few as 20 members and as many as 40 or 50 members. The total number in the United States is at least about 500 or more. The Soviet Union and Germany are next, and then England and France. In terms of technology, Soviet women are probably the most distinctive, because American women are all engaged in civil aviation, while Soviet women participate in military aviation. There are no more than six or seven women in our country who are studying flying, such as Li Yueying, Lin Pengxia, and Wang Canzhi, but unfortunately we have only studied it and have not been able to serve the country! Learning should be applied, and it is meaningless not to learn. Aviation is different from other academic disciplines. Learning or not learning is up to me, and using or not using is up to the government. At present, what the government needs is military aviation talents, and there are very few opportunities for those who study civil aviation. There are no third companies in the country other than Eurasia and China Airlines, and the need for talents is really limited, but I believe that the future will definitely be the world of aviation. To store villages for the country, we must prepare early. Once the technology is learned, heroes do not have to worry about not having a place to use their skills."</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>"What are your opinions on this time of national crisis?" This question seemed to touch her patriotic heart. She talked incessantly for ten minutes, mainly saying, "In this critical autumn of survival for China, there is no distinction between men and women in serving the country. We must do our best. As women who have learned to fly, although we cannot be incorporated into the air force and go to the front line to kill the enemy, we can organize rescue teams and aerial transport teams in the air force to take care of the rear. I am preparing myself. Hongqiao and Longhua are places I often go to. Practicing flying is also a daily lesson. Once the government's conscription order comes, I will quickly rush to serve and be willing to be a pioneer. Recently, Ms. Yan Yaqing and I are launching a women's group, which aims to awaken women to advocate for the aviation industry. Women who do not know how to fly but are enthusiastic or interested in this are all welcome. As long as we can invite the central government to approve, we can proceed smoothly." Finally, she said that it is not impossible for women to learn aviation, but they must have a strong physique, sensitive hands and brains, a strong will, patience, and perseverance, and break through the family and social environment. The most important thing is the government's advocacy, encouragement, and the public's sympathy.</p>
<h3>Ms. Li's Expression When Taking Off in Her Plane at Longhua (This Plane Was Made by the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Bureau)</h3>
<h3>A Letter to Women Across the Country</h3>
<p>— Xiao Bai</p>
<p>——Opinions on Assisting Suiyuan——</p>
<p>Dear Sisters:</p>
<p>I have been longing for an opportunity to communicate with you for a long time. However, I have never been able to do so. Now, because I have many very important things that I must talk to you about, I am humbly borrowing a corner of this garden to write this public letter to you:</p>
<p>At present, our country has clearly reached the final juncture, especially with the recent attack on Suiyuan by the puppet bandit army, which is trying to seize our only remaining first line of national defense, the barrier to North China and the Northwest. If we still have humanity, if we do not want to be obedient slaves of the enemy, then everyone feels that the only way forward is for each of our compatriots to bravely rise up and work hard to save ourselves. We women across the country account for half of the country's population, and we must never again adopt an attitude of watching the fire from the other side and hiding on the sidelines. We must join hands with men to set off a huge wave of national self-salvation and participate in and work hard in all work to assist Suiyuan.</p>
<p>Now, our loyal and brave soldiers on the front line have launched a heroic scene of defending the country in the war of resistance. For the sake of the mountains and rivers of the motherland and for the survival of the nation, they have been fighting bloody battles in the icy and snowy weather and in the midst of the flames of war. The recovery of Bai Lingmiao on the 24th is even more worthy of the greatest glory for the country and worthy of the infinite admiration of the people across the country.</p>
<p>The enthusiastic movement across the country to assist Suiyuan in the past two weeks is even more worthy of our joy and excitement. And our sisters have also organized rescue teams and raised donations to comfort the soldiers, which shows that our women are brave and decisive in their efforts to save the country. We also love the nation and the country in the same way, and have not forgotten the responsibilities that women should bear in the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Here, I would also like to put forward three more concrete and practical points to the women across the country on the current work to assist Suiyuan, because they are what we must do.</p>
<p>First, we should expand the rescue movement. Those of us who already understand rescue work should indeed find ways to go to the front line to rescue soldiers. Those of us who do not understand it should start learning, because that is the most important work for us women in the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Second, we must launch the work of sewing winter clothes and knitting woolen sweaters, because these are necessities for soldiers in the icy and snowy weather, and they are also our very urgent main work.</p>
<p>Third, we must work as hard as men to raise donations, and be able to solicit donations from our relatives and sisters.</p>
<p>In short, now is the time to roar. We don't want empty talk and loud shouts. We want everyone to do it practically! Sisters! I hope you will discuss, supplement, and implement it immediately.</p>
<h3>Pei Yingli's Younger Brother</h3>
<p>— Xue Ying</p>
<p>Oh, heartless heavens! Last night, when Pei Yingli returned from the factory, the path in the dark and wretched Caoxiebang area was bathed in silvery moonlight, and the air felt only faintly humid. Who would have thought that today it would start raining a steady, persistent drizzle!</p>
<p>Pei Ying woke up at five o'clock, not because of the thunder, but because the layers of sorrowful thoughts stirred in her heart, preventing her from falling back into a deep sleep. As soon as she woke up, the sound of rain outside the window drilled into her ears. She didn't need to open the window to know that it was a long-lasting rain that wouldn't stop anytime soon.</p>
<p>Using the red glow from the kerosene lamp, she glanced at a new piece of clothing folded on the table, and couldn't help but sigh deeply. She had saved six months' worth of snack money to make this new outfit. Although it wasn't made of leather, silk, velvet, or even lined, just a thin silk shirt, it had consumed countless thoughts from planning, cutting the fabric, to tailoring. However, this outfit wasn't for her to wear but was made for her younger brother. He was lying on the bed opposite her, his delicate and thin face filling her with more love and pity each time she looked at him. Since their father was brutally killed by the XX army in Guanwai, she had done everything in her power to help him graduate from elementary school, then enter middle school, and then graduate from middle school. She also kept her promise to make her brother a new outfit so he could wear it to take a photo with his classmates on graduation day.</p>
<p>Her brother was indeed obedient. Each semester, in addition to tuition, board, lodging, and books costing around eighty yuan, he rarely spent more than one yuan a month on pocket money. Moreover, his grades were excellent. Pei Ying loved him so much that she really wanted to grit her teeth and send him to high school. However, several relatives felt that Pei Ying was already suffering too much and advised her to quickly find someone to recommend her brother for a job. One of her uncles even clipped an advertisement for the telegraph office's recruitment of clerks. Pei Ying saw that the qualifications—middle school graduate, age 16 to 19, salary of 20 yuan per month—were all suitable. However, the application deadline was too tight: it was noon tomorrow, and tomorrow was not a Sunday, so taking leave from the factory would result in a deduction of pay. Pei Ying ignored this, hoping that her brother could apply and get into the telegraph office, where a monthly salary of 20 yuan would be a very fortunate start for a middle school graduate.</p>
<p>To apply, they had decided last night that he would wear the new outfit. Unexpectedly, the heartless heavens sent rain. Pei Ying now had no time to worry about whether her brother would pass the exam. Her attention was temporarily focused on the new outfit. "Don't let caring for the outfit cost your brother an opportunity." "Don't end up failing the exam and ruining the clothes." These two conflicting thoughts fought in her mind. In the end, she decided to let her brother wear the new outfit because she knew that people nowadays value appearance the most.</p>
<p>Her brother woke up at half past seven, unaware that his sister had been wrestling with these thoughts for more than two hours. When they were about to leave with rain gear, her brother saw that the rain outside was too heavy and was reluctant to wear the new outfit. He wanted to change into something else, but Pei Ying felt it was inappropriate. Although she let him change into an old outfit, she still wrapped the new one up and carefully tucked it under her waist along with the graduation certificate, as if carrying a precious jewel.</p>
<p>Near the telegraph office, Pei Ying found a secluded alley and helped her brother change into the new outfit herself. She repeatedly straightened his collar and hem before letting him walk into the telegraph office alone. By this time, many young people had gathered at the entrance to register. Pei Ying felt there were too many people, and her brother might not be able to register. Seeing that the rain was getting heavier and heavier, she worried that her brother's new clothes would be completely ruined this time. She waited at the alley entrance for what seemed like an eternity before finally seeing her brother running back, soaked to the bone. Without waiting for her to ask, he told her that he had registered. Immediately, a smile surged onto her face, but when her eyes fell on her brother's new clothes, which were covered in rainwater and mud, tears streamed down her face.</p>

<h3>National Government Issues Conscription Order</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>The Ministry of Military Administration issued a proclamation that a conscription system would be implemented on a trial basis in the five provinces of Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu. A sincere announcement to the people.</p>
<p>This conscription law, aimed at bolstering the nation's strength, should be followed without fail. China is currently facing a critical moment, the life of the entire nation dancing in the hands of death. Every Chinese citizen who is not a traitor and does not want to be a traitor is willing to contribute their last drop of blood to the country, to shed it to fight for the nation's final right to exist. Under such circumstances of unusually high anti-enemy sentiment, I believe that every citizen will give the government's conscription order the most enthusiastic support.</p>
<p>The government's conscription order, premised on resisting the enemy, will surely gain the most enthusiastic support of the entire populace. We know that when steel is heated to its melting point, if it is not immediately poured into a mold, it will cool and solidify. Reheating it would waste the coal and time spent melting it previously. There is also a taboo in the art of war called "an aging army." An aging army is one that fails to capitalize on its initial momentum to conquer the enemy's camp, instead prolonging the situation, allowing the enemy to calmly prepare their offensive strategies. Once the morale of our side's valiant soldiers is dampened, their courage will greatly diminish, doubts and disagreements will arise, and they will no longer be able to exert their strength together as they did in their prime. This is very basic common sense. But looking back at the current state of our national resistance against Japan, is it still at its peak? Consider the January 28th Incident. The people of the whole country, especially those living in the counties near Shanghai, supported the 19th Route Army with all their enthusiasm. At that time, in a certain county near Shanghai, an event remains unforgettable to me: a middle-aged woman with bound feet personally brought two large, round blocks of high-quality white sugar rice cakes (which they normally would not casually give away) to the "National Salvation Association," which served as the collection center for comfort items in that county, saying, "There is nothing else to send. My old mother told me to send these rice cakes." But we never went door-to-door to solicit donations, nor did we issue a single fundraising flyer. We only announced verbally that we were collecting comfort items to reward the 19th Route Army. On another occasion, the radio broadcast (since the Shanghai newspapers had stopped reporting) that there were already too many food items sent to the 19th Route Army, more than they could eat, and that they hoped to receive tens of thousands of pairs of straw sandals tied with hemp. The county did not have many straw sandals, and they were never stored in advance. Hemp-tied straw sandals were especially rare, but within two days and nights, they managed to rush-make and collect three thousand pairs. And consider the current nationwide movement, from top to bottom, unanimously supporting the officers and soldiers fighting in Suiyuan. How is it any different from the support given to the 19th Route Army in the past? This is precisely the "morale" of the entire nation, which is at its peak and cannot be obscured by any excuses!</p>
<p>Therefore, with the National Government issuing the conscription law, all of our citizens should support it with the greatest enthusiasm. At the same time, we especially fervently support the government's rapid mobilization of this "morale" of the entire nation, which is at its peak, and "use it while it's hot!"</p>
<h3>On the Island</h3>
<p>— Lin Na</p>
<p>This island is only about one square mile in size and is shrouded in damp mist year-round.</p>
<p>When the Spanish monarchy ruled these thirty-six islands with priests and the Bible, this place was a penal colony for condemned prisoners. A century later, the ruling power changed, and it remained a penal colony for condemned prisoners. The difference was that the priests then instructed the prisoners about their Queen, but now, no one tells them, though they know themselves to be the people of Roosevelt.</p>
<p>On the island's highest peak stands a fortress-like, grand prison, a building constructed by the prisoners themselves to confine themselves. Outside, dozens of watchtowers are scattered, manned by white-skinned guards. Holding their gun handles, they sit there majestically, gazing at the azure sky and listening to the sea's murmur.</p>
<p>Inside the fortress, the roar of enormous machines echoes day and night, spreading across the entire silent island through the tall walls. This comes from four different prison workshops. Prisoners, dragging their clanging shackles, are herded out of the prison cells in groups when the siren wails, heading to the workshops. There, they must labor, managing the blood-sucking machines. It is said that even ordinary prisoners have this privilege, while political prisoners are deprived of even this small freedom.</p>
<p>Armed guards and foremen dragging light iron chains constantly run among them, brandishing whips. For even a small mistake, these prisoners wearing collarless uniforms and with shaved heads are dragged out to be hung and whipped or nailed to large frames in damp basements. Thus, the weak are visited by death, and the strong must embrace their wounds, laboring for reasons they themselves cannot fathom.</p>
<p>When we, as a group of reporters, boarded a light electric boat, chasing the calm waves of Manila harbor, and were led to this terrifying island, it was already around two o'clock in the afternoon. We passed many cold, desolate fields and prison cells, heading toward the workshops emitting the mechanical noise. This was a narrow, long room that could only accommodate about a hundred people, but it was crammed with about one hundred and fifty. The machines roared with clumsy sounds, mixed with the heat and sweat of empty people, swirling in the turbid space, making one feel heavy and dizzy.</p>
<p>The prisoners were skilled in their work. They worked with excessive efficiency, carefully and quietly, as if afraid of making mistakes or falling behind, for they clearly knew what terrible consequences would ensue.</p>
<p>We stood silently, about to move to the other side, when suddenly, everyone was captivated by a strange phenomenon. In that dark corner, a thin old man fainted. Immediately, he was dragged to an open space, lying on his back, his body convulsing terribly, his forehead sweating, his eyes rolling back, and white foam coming from his mouth. Standing next to him was a tall man dressed as a foreman, dragging light iron chains, wielding a whip in his hand, forcefully lashing at him, murmuring curses:</p>
<p>"Now, let's see if you'll pretend to be dead!"</p>
<p>These foremen are chosen from among the prisoners. They are treated favorably by the prison officials and allowed to have a whip, with which they can arbitrarily lash every weak companion, even though they are also prisoners who must spend their lives on this isolated island.</p>
<p>The workshop immediately became tense, but they dared not stop their work to look at the abused companion. They dared not breathe or utter a sigh of resentment. I stood there, bearing extremely bad feelings, looking at every sweating face. I wanted to understand the extent of their anger. However, what I saw were the same desperate and sorrowful faces. A young man of about twenty even grinned and made a face at me.</p>
<p>"Sir, are you sent from above?" he asked me quietly.</p>
<p>"No, I'm a journalist..." I replied, shaking my head.</p>
<p>"Hmm..." his hands were moving again. "Then, can you give me some cigarettes?" he continued, introducing himself. "My name is Rizal, twenty-two years old, coachman, convicted of murder..."</p>
<p>"Don't you also get paid?" I handed him some leftover cigarillos.</p>
<p>"God only knows how they deduct it. We get less than a dollar a month..." he replied, hiding the cigarettes.</p>
<p>The old man had been carried away. There was a series of crisp leather shoe sounds coming from another corner. He winked at me alertly and then went back to work as if nothing had happened. Then, I also lifted my feet and moved towards the exit.</p>
<p>Returning home, I wrote down the following thoughts with a painful heart: "...The prisoners are living in a bloody and hungry atmosphere. They work more than fourteen hours a day, are abused, and eat extremely poor food..."</p>
<p>The next day, in a prominent position, it was changed as follows:</p>
<p>"...We almost can't believe that it is a prison for condemned criminals. Here, they live no differently from ordinary workers. They work and entertain themselves enthusiastically. It is said that many people even save their wages and send them home..."</p>
<p>I laughed loudly, and the newspaper in my hand turned into pieces of scrap.</p>
<h3>Spring Garden Lane</h3>
<p>— Shi Dai</p>
<p>When I was in Beiping, I used to enjoy strolling around "Tianqiao." When I got to Tianjin, I became inextricably linked with the "Three No Zone." This time I ran to Hong Kong, thinking there would be no gathering place for lower-class entertainment like Ping and Tianjin to play around in, but the reality shattered my expectations. Hong Kong has a "Wan Chai" area whose liveliness is not inferior to "Tianqiao" and the "Three No Zone." How happy I was when I discovered this place! I no longer climb the rocky "Mount Davis," no longer run into the pine forest and under the banyan trees to savor the lovely gurgling springs, but spend every dusk and evening in the embrace of "Wan Chai." As if freed from restraints, my heart is so comfortable and so happy. The world of "Wan Chai" has no barrier, no hatred with me. The things I see and encounter are all amiable and kind, and most of all, understandable to me.</p>
<p>What interests me most in the "Wan Chai" area is "Spring Garden Lane." It is the central location for lower-class entertainment, especially for laborers. They continuously pour into "Spring Garden Lane" from the docks, from the factories, from the fish and vegetable markets. Once dusk arrives, the liveliness doubles in intensity.</p>
<p>When the streetlights outside the window shine, I take off the wooden clogs that never leave my feet all day, put on rubber-soled shoes, and go out. Across the sea, countless lights sparkle like stars, the calm sea separating Hong Kong and Kowloon. The countless lights on both sides shine brightly, as if enticing each other. The market is noisy, the sound of mahjong fills every place, and even the urgent ringing of the trams cannot drown it out. The yellow-uniformed Indian police officers direct the passing vehicles, so busy that they are covered in sweat. After a short break, they glance at the sumptuous dishes in the restaurants on the side of the street. Under the neon lights, it is not easy to distinguish between Indians and Malays? Why are there so few white people in this colony? Almost all I see are Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos, Malays, and very few Hawaiians. Whether on the street, in the market, or at the dock, besides the Chinese, only Indians are numerous.</p>

<p>Spiritual Pivot and Simple Questions</p>
<p>— Answered by Dr. Liu Xinbai</p>
<p>Difficulty Breathing and Discomfort</p>
<p>No. 116, Shi Yanchang from Tushanwan, Xujiahui, asks: My constitution has always been weak, and because of overwork, I cannot sleep until after midnight. Sometimes, I am suddenly startled awake from a deep sleep, covered in a cold sweat. When lying on my left side, I experience difficulty breathing and discomfort. A friend said it might be heart disease, which has left me distraught. I would like to ask: (1) What is the illness? (2) What medicine should I take?</p>
<p>Answer: It sounds like heart disease, but there are dozens of types of heart disease, and the treatments and prognoses are all different. Based on your letter alone, it is impossible to determine which type of heart disease it is. Prescribing medicine without a proper diagnosis may lead to errors and even danger. Therefore, please get examined first to determine what the illness is. Then, take medicine and recuperate appropriately.</p>
<p>Blurred Night Vision</p>
<p>No. 117, Li Jingzhong asks: My younger sister is only fifteen years old. After 6 PM, she cannot see with both eyes. She says she can only see blurry lights. Even if other objects are placed right in front of her, she cannot see them. But during the day, her vision returns. Therefore, I would like to ask: (1) What is the illness? (2) Is there any medicine that can cure it? (3) What is the cause?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Night blindness. (2) Nutritional deficiency and neurasthenia. (3) Take "Vitamin A" (Vitamin-A).</p>
<p>Urethral Itching</p>
<p>No. 118, Cheng Xin from Yingxun Road, Nanshi, asks: I was tempted by bad friends to visit prostitutes once. Fifteen days later, my urethra started to itch. Twenty days later, a lump appeared on the inside of my left thigh, and now it is gradually becoming visible. I would like to ask: (1) What is the illness? (2) What medicine is most effective?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Urethral itching is urethritis. The location "on the inside of my left thigh" is unclear. I don't know if you are referring to the outside of the anus. If so, it is likely hemorrhoids. (2) For urethritis, take "Qingzhuobian" (Citropin). Hemorrhoids require cauterization, which you cannot do yourself. You must consult a doctor.</p>
<p>Erectile Dysfunction</p>
<p>No. 119, Huang Tianjiong from Lane 37, No. 105, Bailinan Road, asks: I am thirty years old and very strong. I can work without feeling tired. My symptoms are headaches, pain in my heart and stomach, and the inability to get an erection. When I do get an erection, it only lasts for a second or two. I am worried about not being able to have children. Therefore, I would like to ask: (1) Is it due to excessive sexual activity? (2) How can I have this illness when I am so strong? (3) What medicine can cure it? (4) Is it hopeless for me to have children?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Excessive sexual activity can cause this, but there are many other causes besides excessive sexual activity. (2) Since you have headaches, you should be checked for spinal cord disease, diabetes, and neurasthenia. These are the biggest causes of impotence. Heart and stomach pain should be checked for heart disease and stomach disease. Although heart disease and stomach disease are not causes of impotence, they are still undesirable diseases. There are diseases that only weak people contract, and there are diseases that only strong people contract. Your illness is not related to the strength or weakness of your body. Anyone is susceptible. (3) Inject "Polytonin" and undergo electrotherapy. (4) No.</p>
<p>Anal Bleeding</p>
<p>No. 120, Ms. Zhao Zhiying asks: I am only twenty-two years old. At first, my anus felt hot and painful, and I had constipation. I only had a bowel movement once every two or three days, and there was blood in my stool. My symptoms are still the same. I am pale and thin, and I also have headaches, difficulty breathing, and feelings of distress. These symptoms worsen when my anus hurts badly and disappear when my anus doesn't hurt. I would like to ask: (1) What is the illness? (2) How should I treat it? (3) Is it life-threatening? (4) How should I treat the bleeding? (5) Is there a treatment for the headaches, difficulty breathing, and feelings of distress?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Internal hemorrhoids. (2) Local injection of "Caseobin." (3) No. (4) Take "Sinocalcin" or insert "Adrenalin Suppository" into the anus. (5) This is called "hemorrhoid distress." No treatment is necessary. Once the original illness is cured, it will naturally disappear.</p>
<p>Nosebleeds</p>
<p>No. 121, Qian Chanyuan from Yongmao Steel Company, South Embankment, Zhejiang Road Bridge, asks: I had nosebleeds two years ago, and I am now twenty-two years old. It has been six or seven years. In the first half of last year, I went to a doctor who performed surgery, washing and applying medicine. The bleeding was only from my right nostril, and the doctor focused on my right nostril. The bleeding stopped, but it still happens sometimes. There's really nothing I can do. Now, the inside of my right nostril seems to be blocked, and I can't breathe through it. (1) What is the reason for this? (2) How can I treat it?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) First, examine your nostril for any illness. (2) Lightly insert cotton wool soaked in "Adrenalin" into your nostril. Also, take "Sinocalcin" regularly.</p>
<p>Ear Discharge</p>
<p>No. 122, Zhang Shuzhi asks: My daughter is nine years old and complains of pain in her right ear. She has become deaf, and pus is coming out of her ear. It has not healed despite many treatments. I would like to ask: (1) Is this what is called "red ear"? (2) Is it dangerous? (3) Please tell me the most effective treatment. (4) What is the scientific name?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, the scientific name is acute suppurative otitis media. (2) Treat it quickly, otherwise it will become mastoiditis (a large blister behind the ear) or turn chronic, which will be difficult to treat. (3) Wash the ear with hydrogen peroxide, dry it with cotton wool, and blow in Haibiform powder. It will heal in a few days. Injecting "Panadin" is also very effective. (4) See (1).</p>
<p>Facial Flushing</p>
<p>No. 123, Lin Yonghui from the International Department of the Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, Yongxing Road, Zhabei, asks: Every winter, my face suddenly turns red and hot, and my nose also becomes very red. If I feel even slightly irritated at that time, my face becomes even hotter and redder. Once the fever starts, it doesn't go away quickly. This happens more often in the evening than during the day, and it is not related to the winter wind. Sometimes, the fever starts immediately when I eat or after a meal. My hands are cold, my eyes are blurry, and although I feel mentally alert, I feel very uncomfortable. I would like to ask: (1) What is the illness? (2) What is the cause? (3) How should I cure it? (4) Is there any self-treatment?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Facial capillary congestion. (2) Excitation of the vasomotor nerves. (3) Take "Bromagsin." (4) See (2).</p>
<p>Acid Reflux and Gas</p>
<p>No. 124, Wang Dacheng asks: I often have a very uncomfortable feeling in my abdomen, as if something is pressing down on it. Sometimes I have nausea, regurgitate acid, and regurgitate sour-smelling things. My throat feels numb, spicy, and painful. Two or three hours after eating, my stomach starts to hurt, but it stops hurting if I eat something. Therefore, I would like to ask: (1) What is the illness? (2) Is it dangerous? (3) What should I eat? How should I recuperate? (4) Do I need a stomach wash? (5) What medicine should I take?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Hyperacidity. (2) No, but it is lingering. (3) Foods to avoid are pepper, chili, scallions, ginger, garlic, alcohol, soda water, vinegar, lemons, hawthorns, coffee, and cigarettes. Foods to eat are eggs, meat broth, milk, potatoes, tofu, and various meats. (4) Wash your stomach with a 1% sodium bicarbonate solution. (5) "Biscama" or "Dioxima."</p>
<p>A Bundle of Miscellaneous Questions</p>
<p>No. 125, Chen Xierong from Fudan Experimental Middle School, Xiangyin Road, Jiangwan, asks: I am sixteen years old and have been suffering from nocturnal emission for eleven years. My body is weak. I have several questions and would be grateful for your answers: (1) Can chest tightness, slight pain, and neurasthenia occur together? (2) There is blood in my sputum, and I am also coughing up blood. I have had an X-ray and percussion, and there are no signs of lung disease. Where is the bleeding coming from? (3) The doctor said, "The bridge of my nose is damaged, and I have nasal congestion, phlegm in the back of my nose, and a lot of mucus." Is this rhinitis or something else? (4) Given the above symptoms, and also suffering from anemia, can I do deep breathing and cold water friction? (5) I dream a lot at night. Is washing my feet with hot water effective? (6) What kind of eye drops are best? (7) What medicine should I take for anemia? What common vegetables are effective? (8) Can I drink cold milk in winter? Is it harmful to eat it after it has been left out for a day? (9) Due to the economic crisis and national crisis, my source of income has been cut off. Can you reduce the fees if I come to you for treatment? (10) How long will it take to cure these illnesses completely?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) These are symptoms of heart disease and can also be accompanied by neurasthenia. (2) Blood from a nosebleed can mix into sputum. (3) The meaning of this sentence is unclear. It is probably chronic nasal mucosal inflammation. (4) These treatments must be appropriate for your body. Forcing yourself to do them may be harmful. (5) Effective. (6) What kind of eye disease do you have? (7) For anemia, take "Livemin." Spinach and carrots contain a lot of iron, which can treat anemia. (8) It is best to eat warm milk to avoid causing gastric catarrh. Milk is nutritious, and eating it after it has been left out for a day is not a problem. (9) Please come and talk to me in person. (10) Nosebleeds and anemia can be cured in a short period of time. Heart disease and nasal disease take time to cure.</p>
<p>Treatment for Blood Deficiency</p>
<p>No. 126, Wang Jin from No. 1155, Yuyuan Road, asks: My body is weak (pale complexion, easily fatigued when working, afraid of the cold in winter...). I consulted a doctor who diagnosed me with blood deficiency. I would like to ask: (1) What kind of blood-tonifying medicine should I take and what kind of blood-tonifying injections should I get? (2) What brand of blood-tonifying injections sold in the market is the most effective and reliable? (3) Do I need to have my blood type tested before getting an injection?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) "Livemin." This medicine is a liver extract preparation. The effectiveness of liver extract for anemia has been recorded in various famous medical journals, and many world-famous doctors have written articles introducing it, so there is no need to elaborate. Liver extract therapy for anemia has now become the standard therapy. Iron preparations from the past have become obsolete. "Livemin" is available in both injectable and oral forms. You can choose one to use. (2) See (1). (3) You need to have your blood tested, but not your blood type (blood type is used for blood transfusions). Instead, you need to have a red blood cell count, a white blood cell count, a blood cell type (are there small blood cells, polymorphic blood cells, giant blood cells, red blood cells with basophilic granules...), and a hemoglobin content test (Cocr Index). The benefit of a blood test is not only that your illness can be accurately diagnosed, but also that it can serve as a standard for treatment. In other words, the clear sign that you do not need to continue treatment is when the red blood cell count returns to 5 million and the hemoglobin content returns to 80%.</p>
<p>Walking into the entrance of "Spring Garden Lane", the first thing that catches your eye is the food stalls lining the street. The vendors are all thin, sallow-faced Chinese, their eyes staring intently at passers-by, shouting at the top of their voices:</p>
<p>—A big one for a dime—</p>
<p>—A big pile for two dimes...</p>
<p>Under the arcades on both sides, philosophers with signs like "Tong Tian Xiao", "Li Banxian", "Guiguzi You Gan Ling" and so on, as if threatened by the economic panic, desperately trying to save their precarious fate, agitate their eloquent tongues and talk loudly about the magic of fortune-telling. Sometimes they are almost like the Shanghai prostitutes, dragging people, and those who don't know are startled by him.</p>
<p>Feeling very thirsty, I drank two bowls of red bean porridge next to a small stall, and then went to watch mahjong. There are five or six "mahjong playing" shops on the short "Spring Garden Lane"! The sound of clapping and banging filled the whole street, giving you the feeling of being in a theater. Each mahjong parlor has at least a dozen tables of players, and some have as many as twenty! The rooms are so small, but they squeeze in patiently. Sixty or seventy people occupy those mahjong tables, leaning their backs or sticking to the walls to satisfy their gambling addiction. The soldiers who come here to participate in the bamboo battles are all unemployed hooligans, coolies, and petty citizens. They put their entire lives on this, and their hopes and fantasies are also placed on this. Looking at how pitifully thin they are, their energy is almost exhausted. Yet they are not awakened, forgetting that they are killing themselves.</p>
<p>Past the "mahjong parlors" are the ice rooms, herbal tea shops, hot and cold food stores, etc., interspersed with each other, occupying almost nine-tenths of the entire street. Everyone knows that Cantonese people are especially particular about "eating" (Cantonese people account for more than 80% of the population here). Every restaurant and food store is "full of seated guests". If you have a few cents in your pocket, you can go to the herbal tea shop for some entertainment, and a dime's worth of tea is enough. You can watch the female waitresses applying rouge and powder, and there are several newspapers to read. If you have more dimes in your pocket, you can spend four dimes to listen to the songs of the famous stage stars. Some people sit with a cup of tea until the store closes.</p>
<p>Walking closer to the dog track, there are teahouses and movie theaters, where you can enter and watch for two hours for a penny.</p>
<p>The Jiaojia Street that runs horizontally through the street is known to everyone as "Weishijie" (Food Street). The name itself suggests that the street displays all kinds of food, and the people who come and go are mostly "for food".</p>
<p>Spring Garden Lane! I spent a lot of time here.</p>
<h3>Yan Qi</h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>When the early winter drizzle and breeze tightly lock the dry treetops, I think of Yan Qi again.</p>
<p>He had a weathered face, and a short, small beard covered his chipped upper lip. His eyes always liked to squint at people up and down.</p>
<p>He set up a stall at the entrance of our residence, displaying things that easily tempted children's appetites, a colorful pile. You couldn't talk about "hygiene" in that remote street, let alone a small business. Let the mosquitoes and flies of summer suck the marrow of everything, let the wind and sand of winter cover the entire stall, making the goods lose their luster. These were ineffective on the children. After all, those piles and piles would cause the swallowing of greedy saliva!</p>
<p>——Yan Qi, call him, then look at his face, carefully pointing at the glass box: Lend me two cents for cold noodles!</p>
<p>——Lend again? You haven't paid off the last time, do you know? His eyes squinted again, go, go ask your mother for money to buy it!</p>
<p>A thought quickly floated in Xiaoxinyan's mind, "Asking for money" is not an easy thing. Fine! You dare not lend me, you'll get yours. At this point, he ran back and called a few partners from the same courtyard. Little Maotou and Little Wu were also invited. When they came out, the momentum was a little different. They surged up and asked him if he would lend them or not. He didn't put these little ghosts in his eyes at first, so naturally he wouldn't "yield". In this way, we all united and turned our mouths up, imitating his appearance, drawing our fingers across our faces——</p>
<p>——Look, the glutton who stole meat was cut with a knife, chipped, pfft! pfft!</p>
<p>He didn't want this shortcoming to be on the children's lips. Keeping a beard also had a considerable connection to this. Using this weakness, we attacked him. In order to avoid extra publicity, in the end, we were able to easily satisfy our own desires.</p>
<p>Time is fast, two years are like a gust of wind, gently passing by.</p>
<p>It's spring, everything is overflowing with "the vitality of life", but Yan Qi is deeply locked in sorrow. Depression stimulated his nerves, and he often mixed up the accounts of loans. We knew that there must be endless hidden pain in his heart, but he refused to say it, but the degree of worry gradually deepened.</p>
<p>After that, a child appeared next to his stall, about five or six years old, calling him Dad. How? Didn't he have no family? In the past two years, whether directly or indirectly, we had never heard that he had a child.</p>
<p>From that time on, problems arose with his stall. Sometimes it was set up as usual, and sometimes it could be closed for several days.</p>
<p>It was a late autumn night, and the Meifu Line kerosene lamp on the stall was burning, its light radiating in all directions from the glass cover, strangely dim, accompanied by the desolate street, even more showing a sense of desolation. A woman in her thirties sat next to the stall, her complexion quite ugly, and there was an unapproachable, bleak atmosphere between them.</p>
<p>Then, he didn't set up his stall for more than ten days. This creditor of the children often aroused inexplicable concern. The harsh wind of early winter swept across the residual leaves on the earth, and the fine rain mixed the muddy streets into a muddy porridge. After the lights were lit, it was said that someone was stabbed in Nanhuawozi. It was said that the injured person was Yan Qi, who set up a small stall. The injury was very serious, and his life was in danger.</p>
<p>Why? I don't know. Some say it was a love killing, some say it was revenge, and some attribute it to fate!</p>
<p>From then on, his stall was no longer seen on the street. Ah, we still owed him some odd bits of account! The dry treetops were tightly locked by the early winter wind and rain again. Therefore, I thought of Yan Qi again, but eight years had already passed.</p>
