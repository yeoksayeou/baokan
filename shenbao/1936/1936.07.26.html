<p>— 宜</p>
<p>兩廣的局面已經安定了。中國除却日軍所佔領的地區以外。可以算得完全統一了。在這全國軍事政治和經濟的力量集中起來的時候。在這友好諸國對我們增添了不少希望的時候。我們的外交應該採取怎樣的新步驟呢。</p>
<p>我們决不容認一切侵害我國主權和領土的事實。决不簽訂一切侵害我國主權和領土的條約。我們在外交上固然一向堅守着這樣的防禦陣綫。然而我們終究只不過招架住了近年外交上所受到的種種壓迫。還沒有用了外交的武器。從過去各種不平等條約和所謂「旣成事實」所造成的苦難中間。把整個民族解放出來。這就需要着我們進一步的努力。</p>
<p>我們現在應該趕緊作這進一步的努力了。否則我們就連固有的外交陣綫也終於要守不住的。為什麽呢。因為抱着大陸政策的帝國主義者顯然不會有滿足的日子。他們决不輕易讓我們守住一定的陣綫。過去他們的種種舉動很多可以證明這一點。現在當然也還是一樣。例如最近日本三相會議所發出的半官式宣言。以及內蒙偽軍大肆活動。日海軍定期在福建海面操演這些消息。都直接間接表示着。他們還是要用恐嚇威脅的手段。來衝破我們外交上的防禦陣綫的。</p>

<p>— 本報記者胡仲持胡一臧</p>
<p>（六）從神戶到大阪</p>
<p>次日早上，兵庫縣警署的一個巡查到旅館裏來，向我們嚕嚕囌囌地探問了一番。等他去後，我們忽忽地收拾好行李，便到丸之宮車站上阪神電車。不一會電車就開了。從車窗一路望去，滿眼盡是朝天的大砲似的工廠的烟囱，以及密如蛛網的電綫，在地平綫上襯托着明媚的遠山景色。車道兩旁各個村落上，鱗次櫛比地矗立着日本風和西洋風的各式的住宅。那些日本風的住宅有許多看去很精雅，連帶着綠色的美麗的庭園。這一帶眞是日本可以誇耀的區域，我們很少見到破陋的農家。</p>
<p>到大阪車站已經是中午時分了。這車站是電車和火車都停的，雖還在擴充工程進行的期間，可是規模的宏大，從站台上就看得到了。出了車站，我們跟着大羣的行人，穿過了滿是電車汽車和公共汽車的極闊的馬路，便在車站前一條較狹的馬路上，找到了一個旅館，把行李安頓下來。於是我們踱進附近的酒家，吃了一頓牛肉的鍋燒。飯後呌了「太克希」到本田町中華北幫公所去。大阪的「太克希」眞多得可驚。有些馬路上，只見空車連串地駛着兜生意。這種現代的交通利器已經使日本自國所發明的人力車漸漸兒歸於淘汰了。現在大阪全市聽說只剩着三百部人力車，是專給好奇的西洋旅客乘坐的。</p>
<p>「太克希」的租費，在大阪和東京都比神戶便宜些，起碼是三十錢（日金）。車廂前部裝有租費自動指數計。過了三十錢的里程，指數計上就跳出四十錢的數字來。此後每逢駛過了一個什麽單位的路程，就再加十綫。乘客呌車子用不着問價錢。我們的「太克希」從車站前到本田町中華北幫公所只要五十錢。</p>
<p>中華北幫公所是北幫華僑集資自建的一所大洋房，附設着我國駐大阪領事辦事處。大阪是東亞最大的工業都市，歐美各國都設有領事館，可是跟日本關係最密切的我國偏在大阪沒有正式的領事館，這委實是一種遺憾。我國政府早想在日本添設　自領事館，可是一則因為領館經費缺乏，二則因為要獲得日外務省的同意，難免要有交換的條件。所以只在重要的都市添設幾個領事辦事處就算了。原來添設領事辦事處照例是用不着微求日本政府的同意的。然而自從我國在日本添設了幾個辦事處以後，日本政府要在華北一帶發展日僑的勢力，也就在我國許多非通商口岸添設起領事出張所來了。</p>
<p>我國駐大阪領事辦事處設在中華北幫公所的樓下，有一大間屋子是貨單簽證處。在這對面的領事辦公室裏，我們會見了任家豐領事。他是宜興人，從小在日本讀書，奉派到大阪任職已經三年餘了。他一見如故地跟我們閑談了許多時候，還給我們寫了一封致大阪市長的介紹信。我們問到大阪的僑胞情形，承他答覆如下：</p>
<p>「大阪華僑的有二千二百餘人，大部分是貿易商行商理髮匠和廚子。貿易商的生活常然比較的好些，可是他們的營業狀况也一年不如一年了。此外的僑胞就都只能苦苦地過着日子。僑胞的鄕土觀念很濃厚，商人方面分成南北兩大幫，各設有公所。北幫公所勢力較大，入會商號的有三百家光景，還附設着一個學校，呌振華小學。這是大阪華僑自辦的唯一的學校。南北兩幫共同組織的團體，呌華商商會，採用着委員制，有常務委員七人。此外大阪華僑的團體還有旅阪華商綢業公會，大阪華僑理髮公會和大阪華僑料理業公會。」</p>
<p>回到旅館，一個大阪警署派來的便衣巡查正等候在那裏。他問明了一切，知道我們不是什麽Spy便對我們說道，「在這次的長途旅行中，你們當然有稿子寄到貴報去。寫的時候，請不要寫到我們社會上壞的方面，只寫寫好的方面就是了。」我們不願他纏下去，便順口回答道「不打算在貴國長住下去，恐怕要看出你們骨子裏的壞處來，也不很容易吧。况且我們是到貴國來觀光的，當然想在好的方面多多學得些。」</p>

<p>— 家禾</p>
<p>目前成為軍部與廣田直接肉搏的，不是別的問題，而是調查局的擴大職權，和由之而來之無任所大臣的設置，與行政機構的改革。當內閣審議會廢止時，有許多人以為這是內閣調查昇格的先弊，事實也並非如此。內閣審議會的存在，是補强內閣的機能，那時為着第一黨的政友會，採取野黨的態度。廣田內閣，旣得政黨的援助，（雖然是有限度的），自然無需這樣的機關，而且自失去高橋是淸和齋藤實兩長老後，要我到同一的人物來塡補，也勢所不能，因此痛快地廢了牠，這並不足供吉田茂們可以彈冠相慶的反證。事實也是如此，軍部所希望之具有立案權，具有預算權，成為內閣中小內閣的調查局，至今還是一個未知數。（三月二十日的東朝尙有閣僚反對內閣調查局强化的新聞）。另傳來的消息。無任所大臣，可依軍部之意而設立，但這位大臣，不是聽命於三宅坂的吉田茂長官，而是貴族院議長迎衛文磨（六·二三中外）；目前各報對於此事，均愁眉不展，好似不得其人，則無任所大臣的設置，很難通過於閣議。到穴月二十九日，內閣調查局與內閣閣僚的對立更加明顯。因為前者以全體議官决定的改革行政機構案—卽廢拓務省，合併農林商工為產業省，合併鐵道遞信為交通省，擴大衛生局為衛生省，計將原有十二省，縮小為十省，—送於閣議，要求三長官所提出的國策先議，也受閣僚的排斥。有些閣僚們尙不肯把調查局全體議官的議案作為提案，只許供留參考，置吉田茂的反對而不顧。（六·三〇中外）。</p>
<p>切斷軍部與少壯官僚的聯絡，早非少壯軍人所能忍；後者唯一的希望是把調查局昇格，如成為泡影，那不等於將軍部拋出政治的圈外嗎？軍部僅在閣議中，參與政治，永久得不着勝利的，因為只佔兩個議席；如有調查局的擴大職權，上有無任所大臣兼長官吉田茂，下有少壯官僚和軍部派遣的議官，自然可收臂指之效。現在廣田內閣不獨不滿足他們的慾望，反要他們後退，道絕不是軍部所能忍。所以到六月末，寺內大將以「國策氾濫」（各省提案太多，新聞界諷為「國策氾濫」機會，向廣田「進言」而且極力支持賴母木的「電力國家統制案」。　受這個「進言」壓迫的結果，廣田打破自己手訂的規章，七月三日閣議時，允許三長官列席。雖然尙沒有議到行政機構改革的問題，而賴母木的提案，巳足釀成重大的糾紛。原來，日本這個國家，基於地理和燃料資源缺乏的緣故，電氣業特別發達。目前所有電力，分操在東電（東京電燈），東邦電力，大同電力，日本電力和宇冶川電氣五大電氣卞特爾的手裏，錯什地連鎖以三井·三菱·住友·安田各財閥的資金。由於獨佔利爺的分割，常常發生重大的政潮，大正一代和昭和初期，內閣的更迭，對牠都發生了密切的關係。後來為着彼此的鬥爭，有害於財閥的權利，便由有關係的財閥，促進他們的合作，卽「電力聯盟的規的」，便應運而生。這種暫時的停戰，並沒有消滅內部的紏紛：甲州系財閥屬於東京電燈的若尾璋八（政友會的大人物）素來主張「電力國營」；宇冶的林社長，則堅持「發電國營」，「賣電民營」；三井財閥的小林一三，都用東京的勢力，統治全日本的電業，要求「五大電力的合併」。這些各以背後財閥為後盾的主張，仍舊潛伏在各電力卞特爾負責人的腦裏。現在為着軍部的要求（這對於工業家頗有利益），遞相接受吉田茂一手造成國營的提案，名曰所有權操於投資者，營業權歸於政府，實際上是剝奪財閥獨佔的利益。這秤政策，連民政黨（與柬邦有密切關係）的幹部，都取反對的態度，其他反對聲，也瀰漫三島。素來受昭和電力（大同電力的子公司）資助的賴母木遞相，究竟抱何存心，我們不得而知，目前如無修改地執行吉田茂的原案，顯然對各大財閥，有害無益。依過去歷史的指示，這會釀成了今後重大政潮的一個主因。如果廣田沒有適當的處置，由於閣僚的齟齬，（七月三日閣議時各相意見巳有參差）。財閥的憤怒，內閣前途，是未可樂觀的。</p>

<p>— 上海光華大學教授廖世承</p>
<p>三，誤解學習的性質和應用有一個中學生參加公民常識測騐競賽時，得到第一名的獎品，他對於公民應具的理想資任等，知道得很淸楚。大家認他是一個好公民。不道過了數個月，他因為做了一件妨害公共秧序的事情被警察拘了去。常人的批評，以為那個學生並沒有眞的了解公民的資任。他的話是空虛的。詳細的審度，知道問題沒有這樣簡單。歷來的學校，祗注重理智的了解，以為可以涵蓋一切生活。對於欣賞的，情緒的反應，特別忽略。卽以上述的例子而論，學校祗供給了理智的學習，了解的反應，以為可以控制情緒和道德的環境。實則關於這一類的學習反應，應該偏重情感或欣賞方面，偏重態度及行動方面。所以不單是要知道何者為眞實的學習，並須知道生活中什麽情景需要什麽學習反應。沒有情感作用的事情，可用理智的學習來控制，需要行動的情景，僅僅理智的反應，便無濟於事。</p>
<p>誤解學習的性質和應用，還有一種壞影響。例如英文至少需要四種教學法；文法應用科學的方式，文學須用欣賞的方式，作文是一種文學的藝術，拚法最須應用練習的原理。文法同文學的差別，猶之代數同運動的差別。所以文法教得好的，文學未必教得佳。但現在統稱為英文，教學的方法不分，結果那裏會好呢！</p>
<p>除了上述的三種誤解以外，教學方面，還有一個絕大的弊病，就是教得太多，學得太少。學生在課室內，祇有聽教師的講解，自己很少活動。以後應設法教學打成一片，在各科目內抽出一部分教學時問，指導學生自習。要知教學效率的大小，不在教學時間的多寡，而在時間的善用。</p>
<p>中學的訓育巾學校內最難處置的是訓育問題，但是最重嬰的也是訓育問題。一個學校風紀的好壞，影響全校整個的行政；一個學生品性的優劣，影饗一生整個的事業。所以各國對於訓育，都很重視。近來我國中學的風紀，已視前進步。但學生怠惰苟且，散漫頽唐的精神，依然存在。其故由於過去的學校，對於訓育的見解，不無錯誤。過去的學校，把教學看作一件事，訓育看作又一件事。因此教師上課，祇知教書，對於學生的行為方面，思想方面，絲毫不去理會。學生在校，祗知讀書，對於體格的鍜鍊，情感的陶冶，視為次要的事。履霜堅冰，由來久矣！</p>
<p>談到學風，我們大家都羨慕英國的「公立中學」。他們的學風所以好，就因為教訓不分家，不論在教學，運動，或其他的生活方面，都能把整個的學生來訓練。所以師生之間，感情融洽，學生沒有一個不愛他的師長，不愛他的學校。德國中學向來拘束呆板，偏重理智主義，但自靑年運動勃興後，全國的精神態度為之一變。靑年運動的主旨，在解脫都市的束縛，多與自然相接觸。參加運動的人們提倡組織小團體，過那漫游野宴的生活，藉以培養靑年獨立的扶能，强健的身體，樹立團體的風紀，互助的精神。他們一致的口號是愛祖國，愛人民，愛本國的風土人情。這個運動。不單是使靑年的身心，發生重大的變遷，就是對於教育原理和實施方面，也有影響。照他們的見解，知識是文化的基礎，不是文化的目的。文化所代表的是活動，意志，創造，和一個均衡的，和諧的人格。所以教育的目標，不應以獲得知識為能事，應發展個人的各方面，身體，意志，和情感。試騐教育的效率，不應以複述教材為標準，應以學生有否興趣和能力去發明事理為準則。</p>
<p>從上邊兩個例子看來，中國中學的趨勢，不重在知識的灌輸，而重在全人格的培養。我們現時雖提倡教訓合一，但在制度及人事方面，稍有變更，精神方面，依然隔閡。隔閡的主要原因，為一般教師不能深切了解教訓合一的重要性。所以師生間的情感疏淡，教育效率，渺乎其微。以後的教育，必須把訓教打成一片，把整個的靑年，作為訓練的對象；把服務社會，獻身國家，作為訓練的目標。</p>
<p>國難到了如此嚴重地步，我們不希望中學校內養成一般潔身自好，讀死書的靑年。我們希望個個靑年受過中學教育以後，有强健的體格，知道性的衛生；讀書明理，有豐富的常識，應用的技能，幷能隨時運用思想，研求高深的學理；意志堅强，不怕危難，責任分明，不執我見，服從團體的命令，遵守公衆的紀律。個個靑年，都有革新社會的精神，抱着復興民族的决心。我們知道中國的大患，不在强鄰，而在人心沒有改造，民衆沒有團結。如這兩點弊病不改除，縱使徼倖打了一個勝仗。以後還是國難重重。倘使人心漸漸地改造了，民衆漸漸地團結了，雖屈服於一時，終必有復興的一日。改造人心，團結民衆的責任，必須受過中學教育的一般靑年來担任。必須受過中學教育的一般靑年從本身做起，綫可袒當這個重任。</p>

<p>華東社云、本市國勞調查機關、昨接漢口來電、謂湘鄂贛皖新米、已經登場出新、每袒（合市斤一百六十斤）祇六元一二角左右、農民莫不雀躍歡騰、長江水勢、較去年淺一丈五六尺、兩岸田疇、均受惠不少、如此雨水調勻、得有十足豐收、為數十年來未有之盛事、從此粤局奠定、湘贛米可由粤漢路（現正籌備通車）直達粤省、不需再購暹羅西貢米、國內經濟得賴復興、「天災人禍」一語、已可謂不適用於今後之中國矣、茲誌詳情如次、</p>
<p>四省豐收</p>
<p>某大金融業昨接漢口確報、謂湘贛鄂皖四省新米、已開始登塲、米珠圓潤、粒粒挺秀、尤以鄂皖沿長江兩灘為豐收、統扯每畝田有十元左右之生產、農民除償租賦外、尙有三四元餘利、若往年並不虧欠、則可敷半年至九個月之開支、故四省農民、莫不歡忭萬狀</p>
<p>米價低廉</p>
<p>該項新米、每担價祇六元一二角、平均每百斤不及四元、較小麥·麵粉·價格尤為便宜、農民若攙入粗雜之大麥·蠶豆·之類、並佐以菜蔬、每人一斗米可維持半月至二十天、農民為最儉省、從此政治上若得安定、準可安居樂業、</p>
<p>直接運粵</p>
<p>往年粤省人民所需食米、除極少部份由該省自產外、餘均向暹羅西貢購進、每年損失、頗為不貲、蓋往時並不因政治上有崎形、而不願與國內各省往來、實因交通阻塞、購國米反較洋米為貴也、今茲而後、有粤漢路直接運送、又可由國營航業機關、由武漢經上海、直運廣州、合價决不致超過於洋米價格、政治經濟、連成一片、於國民經濟建設運動、裨益尤非淺鮮、</p>
<p>長江水淺</p>
<p>該機關又接得同樣報告、謂長江水勢、較去年同時期、祇達一丈五六尺、其水位並不因築堤而更易、乃依據實在紀錄、兩灘堤岸、若能時時修理疏濬、田疇受惠、較人為方法、决可事半功倍、此稱天助成功之水源、隱然若中國復興之徵兆云云、</p>
<p>棉花滋長</p>
<p>再者棉花因雨水調勻、天時晴雨有度、滋長甚為有勁、近旬日來雨少晴多、於刈草工作上、尤為有利、今年全國經濟委員會、棉業統制委員會聯絡銀行界、賡續作經濟上援助外、且於產棉區域、分派技術人員與農夫「同辛共苦」、澈底改良結果、預料本屆秋收、有超出十一萬萬担以上、三年以後、可不需要外棉供給、五年以後、且可有餘貨輸出云、</p>

<p>華東社云、財政部中央直接稅籌備處正副處長高秉坊·梁敬錞、前日自京來滬、向孔部長請示所得稅開徵事宜、除高氏業已返京外、梁氏尙留滬辦理其他事務、華東社記者昨特往訪、叩以所得稅開徵期及徵收方法等情、承告各情如下、</p>
<p>謁孔部長呈閱細則</p>
<p>據梁氏談、本人係於二十二日與高秉坊處長同自京來滬、昨日（按卽二十四日）晋謁孔部長、並將業已草竣之所得稅暫行條例、施行細則、呈孔氏核閱、該項細則共六十條、俟孔部長核閱後、卽携京供專家審查後、再轉呈行政院通過公布、高處長業已事畢返京、本人則因尙有其他事務、須展至下星期一日始返京、</p>
<p>九一開徵全國實行</p>
<p>所得稅開徵之確期、預料九月一日可以實現、屆時全國一律實行、因暫行條例已完成立法手續、並經國府明令公佈、現在施行細則亦已草竣、俟孔部長檢閱後、卽送呈行政院、再經行政院會議通過、卽可施行、開徵方法、施行細則中、已有明文規定、祇待孔部長取决、將來外僑亦照章徵收、卽我國在海外人民、亦均須遵照歐美各該國法律、繳納該稅也、所得稅一經開徵後、每年收入數目、在最初創辦之一二年、預料年可三千萬至五千萬元光景、</p>

<p>申時報云、我國蛋及蛋產品、居出口貨之第三位、以英德美三國為輸出目的地、維邇來英美鑒於吾國產品如是活躍、頗有戒心、亟思培養其國內生產力、故限制吾國蛋品之進展、尤以德國自統制匯兌以來、華蛋品輸德大受打擊、察其貿易之趨勢、前途殊堪憂慮、實部對此甚為注意、除咨外交部令駐外大使隨時注意外、並令國際貿易局、積極劃解辦法、同時上海英國商會與中國國際貿易協會、合組之中英貿易協會、為促進中英貿易起見、亦首先注意及此、擬具五項改進辦法、呈請實部核示、茲分誌五面辦法如下、</p>
<p>改進蛋產</p>
<p>研究改進蛋產、由蛋業公會及商檢局、中英貿易協會等推舉代表、組織蛋產品改進委員會、聘任專家、設立塲所、研究推廣改良鷄種、增加產量、同時並指導飼養預防疾病等工作、所需經費、除上列各機關捐助一部分外、並請政府倣中國合眾蠶桑改良會辦法、按月補助的欵、</p>
<p>敎育宣傳</p>
<p>以敎育宣傳、灌輸國內農民養鷄之智識、此項工作、現由私人舉辦養鷄雜誌、力量旣微、收效自少、以後應增加刋物、以淺顯文字、載飼養防治疾病方法、傳佈民間、俾知改善、</p>
<p>對英宣傳</p>
<p>英國蛋商、鑒於華蛋品在英銷路之活躍、竭力宣傳華蛋產品、品質不佳、主張禁止進口、或加重稅率以限制之、華蛋輸英、因之大受打擊、近年此項破壞宣傳、雖暫停止、但吾國為發展蛋業計、不能不積極推銷、不得不擴大宣傳、應由政府刋印英文小冊、說明我國蛋廠之整潔、檢騐工作之完備、此外並應將自農村養鷄至蛋品輸出之經過情形、攝成影片、在英國民間團體集會時、設法開映、則宣傳力量旣大、而收效之宏、自可想見、</p>
<p>减免捐稅</p>
<p>吾國出口關稅、為國家歲收之一、在此財政困難之際、自難一律豁免、惟查內地如蕪湖運滬之鷄蛋、已經納稅、抵滬後此項鷄蛋、改成流質、裝運出口、上海稅關仍徵出口稅、此種一貨兩稅制、應設法變更、將來國家收稅稍裕、出口稅卽應免除</p>
<p>擴大檢騐</p>
<p>蛋品檢騐、除以化學方法、分析其內容外、蛋廠檢定、亦至重要、現查上海商品檢騐局、檢騐蛋廠、僅及滬市、其內地蛋廠、因路途遙遠、尙未劃入檢查範圍、以後似應同受檢查、庶在國外宣傳、吾國蛋產品之整潔、較有力量、</p>
<p>進行槪况</p>
<p>聞實業部已接受上項條陳、卽令國貿局與各關係方面商談後、復召集各蛋廠方面、詳細研究、對於五項辦法、已議有端倪、今後蛋產品出口、當能增加不少力量、至於美國方面、近亦有提高蛋產品稅之議、除由實部轉咨外交部、令駐美大使妥為交涉外、復由國貿局集合蛋業鉅商、商議補救及應付方法、現已有相當途徑、</p>

<p>兒童專刋準備  子系　　大凡一件事情，要想獲得成功，事前就非有充分的準備不可。譬如國家同敵國戰爭，那在戰前就非先將軍械啦，糧食啦，戰略啦等等充分的準備起來不可；再像在校裏舉行考試或畢了業投考學校，事前也非先把各科充分的準備一下不為功。總之：不論一件什麽事情，事前有了充分的準備，不怕事情不達成功而得圓滿結果。反轉來說：要是事前沒有準備，或缺少準備，那結果遭着失敗而白費精神徒耗金錢，原也在意料之中。關係有準備而獲成功無準備而遭失敗，在中外古今的歷史上不知有幾多的事實足夠我們證明，不過這裏我也不想去一一嚕囌了。此刻，我只用十萬分的誠意來恭請全國小朋友，今後不論幹什麽事情，事前都要有一個極充分的準備。記牢，與其想苟且，偷懶，無準備而遭失敗，母寗發奮，苦幹，有準備而獲成功。組織補蠅隊  君朋　　火傘高張，炎暑逼人的當兒，蒼蠅大肆活躍，人們就有生病而性命危險的可怖，我記得在三四年前的上海，發生極可怕極危險的時疫流行病，當時死亡的入很多，並且這種疫癘，大多在數小時卽無救，一傳十，十傳百，互相傳染，頓時可以死人幾十，幾百，幾千，豈不是可怕麽？　　蒼蠅這種東西，性喜麕集於污穢的物上，身體上有無數細毛，在細毛上就帶有幾千萬的細菌，它時常在我們的飯菜上停留，不免有無數細菌，停滯在我們吃的東西上，誤食後免不了要生病，雖說身體强壯，抵抗力强，然而究竟是少數。　　小朋友！我們住居附近的小朋友，就可以聯合起來，組織一個捕蠅隊，人數不拘多少，每隊要推舉一個隊長，主持和督促，隊員的捕蠅工作，每人只要備火柴匣子一隻，竹筷一雙，捕蠅拍一個，（商店裏七個銅元買一個）每天各人拍了若干，聚集在隊長家的空塲上，用火燒掉，並且隊長要把各隊員的成績記出來，每星期報告一次，使大家競爭，更希望小朋友的家長，時常鼓勵，或再備以練習簿，鉛筆，橡皮等的獎品，以成續優勝者獎之，使他們肯努力，小朋友，趕快組織起來吧！反芻  眞　　在暑期中的一天，敏兒閒着無事可做，他覺得這樣的度日子是太乏味了。於是他便到書房裏尋書本來看看。不一會他看到了牛的反芻，便很驚奇的去找尋他的哥哥去詢問這奇怪的問題。　　「哥哥，你總知道牛是反芻的動物。它為什麽要這一番反芻的手續？是不是很麻煩的嗎？」　　「你要知道凡在自然界中的一切有生命的生物，無論它的一舉一動，都是能適應它四周一切的環境，所以牛的反芻也是適應環境的一種。至於它到底為什麽要反芻？簡括的說起來，不外有兩個原因：（一）在從前沒有人畜養牛之前，它是生長在荒野之中，四周的猛獸都要來侵害它。牛性本是很和善的，它要在這兇猛的環境中生活，不得不謹愼起來，所以它在吃草的時候，便草草了事，不去細嚼，以防猛獸的侵害。（二）草類這樣的東西，不十分容易消化。有了這兩大原因，牛類便有了這一番反芻的工作，來消化食物，維持生命，因此它的胃也具有一種特別的構造了。」　「牛反芻的程序是怎樣的？」　　「牛胃的構造是很複雜，分做四個小胃：第一胄是瘤胃，第二胃是蜂巢胃，第三胃是重瓣胃，第四胃是皺胃的時候，不細細的咀嚼，就經食道而到瘤胃，這胃是四個胃中最大的一個。食物在這胃中經過沒有多時的潤濕而柔軟後，便到蜂巢胃。這胃的內部，有細胞構成的網，像蜜蜂案一般，所以有這名稱。食物在這胃中再加以潤濕，更使道食物柔軟些，然後從這胃反到嘴裏，再細細的咀嚼。使食物細碎。我們平日看見牛的嘴，不是常常的在動嗎？這就是在咀嚼。經過細嚼的食物，重又嚥下，那知道這食物不經第一第二兩胃，而直接到重瓣胃，然從再從重瓣胃到皺胃，這胃和其他動物的胃差不多，也能分泌胃液，消化食物　　「巡很奇怪！為什麽第一次嚥下的食物到第一胃？而第二次從蜂巢胃反到嘴裏咀嚼後的食物，嚥下時，直接到第三胃，這是什麽的道理？」　　「這種奇怪的現象，因為它的構造很奇巧。為什麽第一次嚥下的食物到第一胃？因為當牛把不經細嚼的食物，經過食道，到食道和各胃的管口相通的地方，所嚥下粗大的食物，把接通第一胃的管壓開，於是食物便到第一胃了。為什麽第二次嚥下的食物，直接到第三胃？當第二次嚥下的食物，已經是咀嚼過了，所以變成了半流動的像漿糊一般的，它的壓力不及粗大的食物，於是它不能使第一胃的管口壓開，只得經過其他的管道，而到第三胃去了。」槍桿歌  齋夫　　文人拿筆桿；武人拿槍桿。筆桿好駡人；槍桿好搗亂。駡人還被衆人罵；搗亂終被大衆趕！　　筆桿要向內；槍桿要對外。向內好修身；對外可禦害。人人修身世可治；一致禦侮國常泰！犁鋤歌　　織婦拿機梭；農夫拿犁鋤。機梭會織布：犁鋤耕田禾。織布可免天下寒；禾熟可免衆人餓。　　梭勤土布多；鋤忙國產富。人人穿土布；人人用國貨。認明國產吃穿住，纍纍私貨奈我何！科學小問題風是從那裏來的？  子系　　風，小朋友！恐怕沒有一天不威覺到吧。有時它肯為我們人類服務：像帮助駛船啦，為花果作媒啦等等；有時却同我們人類搗蛋：像吹翻船隻啦，傾覆房屋啦等等，並且風是來無形去無踪的，說不定小朋友因此就以為風眞是一種奇怪的東西，其實一些也沒有奇怪可言，原是自然界裏一種極普通的現象。我們知道地球的表面包着一層空氣，空氣受到太陽的熱，就膨脹起來。空氣一膨脹，密度就稀薄。冷地方受到太陽的熱度少，空氣自然很濃厚，濃厚的空氣為要塡補稀薄空氣的空隙，因此，馬上很迅速的向薄空氣方面趕，於是後面的空氣，也就接着飛駛上來。這樣空氣就發生了很大的運動，這便是我們普通所說的風。因為地面上，所受太陽的熱度是永遠不會平均的，所以，地球上的風，也因此永遠沒有停止的時候，不過有時大些，有時小些的分別罷了。　　要是小朋友！不信空氣的厚薄會發生風的話，那末請卽用手掌在耳邊搖動，也準可證明這原理的不錯哩。合羣  戶人　　天氣雖然熱，可是，螞蟻們仍舊要出來尋食，大概它們不以為熱罷，一隻黑蟻在地上爬來爬去尋食，忽然，被它看見了一條蜈蚣橫在樹根旁，它以為死了——其實是在打盹——所以很快活，便很快的跑回去報信了；果然，不一會兒，在窠中出來了許多螞蟻，由這發見的黑蟻領導着向樹根爬去。　　螞蟻們把　蜈蚣密密的圍着，用口想把它拖動，可是，這蜈蚣被它們驚醒了，它看見自己被這許多螞蟻圍着，便想掙扎逃去，但是螞蟻旣尋到了這頓點心，豈肯白白的放棄？所以拚命地用口咬着，那蜈蚣見它們不肯退讓，便用毒鉗向螞蟻進攻，這一來螞蟻們被咬死的很多，但是它們並不因有損失而退却，反愈聚愈多，大家都向蜈蚣身上亂咬　經過了好久的劇鬥，結果蜈蚣的脚都被螞蟻咬下，一雙毒鉗也被咬去，螞蟻們也死了許多，最後的勝利却是屬於螞蟻的——蜈蚣力　盡而斃，螞蟻們便共同把它拖回窠去了。微小的禮物  子基　　當日俄戰的時候，國中的百姓，很踴躍的各把金錢糧食以及各種物品捐給政府，慰勞在戰塲上的兵士。一天，俄國的市政廳門口，站着一個美麗的女郞，看她的樣子，雖然不是一個富人的女兒，但穿得很淸潔。她羞澀地觀望在她前面的人。她是等侯着走到那個接受捐贈傷兵禮物的櫃臺前面　　踴躍輸捐的人，潮水般的在她前面走過，——一個商人把一袋金錢放在櫃臺上，一個婦人捐了一串很値錢的珠練，一個工人把他辛苦換來的幾塊錢也捐了……　　那個女郞候了許久，方才輪着她上去。她鼓着勇氣道：「我也有一件禮物，贈給為我們祖國奮鬥而受傷的兵士。不過這禮物極小，使我不敢拿出來。牠是很不値錢的，但是，我除了這東西外，再沒有別的了。」　　櫃臺裏的人微笑道：「就是極小的禮物，我們也極歡迎的。」說完伸出一隻手來。　　女郞羞澀地道：「在這裏呢，除了這個，我沒有別的東西了。」她一邊說，一邊從她那斗篷底下抽出兩條金色而柔潤的髮辮來。當她把髮辮交給櫃臺的人的時候，斗篷上那頂兜帽，向後脫落了，露出一個美麗的，金髮篷鬆的頭。有趣的科學把戲滑翔飛機  王云　　現在，不用汽油開動的滑翔飛機，非常時行，各國都在研究着。你如果高興的話，我可以敎你拿一張普通紙來摺隻滑翔飛機玩玩。如果你依照我所說的方法做，牠就能在空中繼續的打轉，或成螺旋形的飛出去，那是非常有趣的。第一你必須細心的做，做成有規則的形狀（如圖一）牠就可以一直飛出去了。　　倘使要使滑翔機做得能在空中打轉，那末，你就應該把牠後冀的角，向上摺成直角形，（如圖二）當你把牠擲出去的時候，大部份的力量，把飛機的尖頭偏向上方滑走。這需要一些實際的經騐，才能做成功，不過，你立刻就可以學得這種巧妙的。當牠在空中打了一個旋轉之後，便低落下來，向下滑走。（如圖三）如果你把這種滑翔機，從高處放落下來，牠自己還會糾正自己，一直的滑走出去（如圖四）。　　倘若你要你的飛機在空中成螺旋形的旋轉起來，你就得把滑翔機，做成像圖五那樣。有一隻後翼的角，向外摺，另一隻角摺得向下。這極滑翔機在空中飛走的時候，牠突然很快的繞着牠的長軸旋轉時，牠會忽然向上，忽然向下的滑走起來，例如第六圖。　　要使牠飛起來的時候，會向下廻轉，那末，牠後翼的兩隻角，就要摺得向上彎曲過來，成直角，（如圖七）於是，照平常的擲法，把牠擲出去，牠就會像圖八那樣的飛射出去　　這種滑翔飛機，為什麽會在空中飄行？說起來，牠所含的道理，也是很簡單的。我們知道，空氣和水一樣，也是有一種浮力的。比方飛艇就能够浮在天空飛行。但是，同樣大的一張紙和同體積的空氣比起來，紙要比空氣重，所以紙並不能浮在空中。但當紙向下落的時候，牠把空氣向下壓，同時空氣就發生一種反抗力量來抵抗牠，把紙向上抬。紙的面積越大，空氣把牠向上抬的力量也越大。所以紙飄飄的落下來，落得非常慢。因為我們的紙飛機前部小而重，後部的翅膀大而輕，所以牠就能一直向前飄行出去。夏令兒童健康營巡禮（下）  雅非　　營房共有二十二個，男的十六營，女的六營，每營裏有十一隻鐵床，十隻小床是孩子睡的，另有一隻大床却是一個護士睡的。營房的左面是膳堂，西首乃乒乓球室，前面是一個花園。花園裏遍植着冬靑黃楊，及各種花卉，那二百二十個小朋友，每天便可逗留其間。教職員的辦公室，却在大禮堂的前面。　　這里的兒童，男童有一百六十人，女童僅六十人，最高的年齡為十三歲，最低的年齡祗七歲：程度方面，多數是幼稚園，其餘是初小一年級到三年級。　　關於生活方面，他們裏面也有一個標準；現在，我且將他們的生活作息程序抄錄在下面：每日，上午六時未起床前測騐體溫。六時三十分起身，及盥洗。七時朝會，日光操。七時三十分早餐。八時至十時大便，柔軟體操，診療，均分班舉行。十時四十分上課，（假期作業）。十時五十分起休息，十一時三十分上課，（圖晝手工）。十二時午餐。下午，三十分盥洗。一時午睡。二時三十分起床及盥洗。三時上課，（常識音樂）。三時半五十分進滋補品牛奶餅乾等。四時十分沐浴。五時五十分洗手帕。六時戶外遊戲。七時晚餐。七時三十分豐洗及靜息。八時聽音樂講故事。八時四十分安艘。九時熄燈。此外，還有一種特別活動，如：兒童衛生教育電影，名人演講，音樂會，遊藝會，演說競賽，兒童表演。野外生活有，團體旅行，游泳，採取動植物標本。於每星期日舉行，地點在葉家花園，砲台灣，市中心區，江灣公園，市中心區第一公園，吳淞等各地，其他則臨時决定。　　收費，每人是十二元，期間三個月，營裏除正副營長外，有護士二十二人，教職員等數十人。國王與牧童（一）  新　　從前在某一個國中住着兩個孩子，名兒都呌做華樂。這一個孩子，長着一頭黃色的　髪，亮閃閃地好像金子一般，凡是女人們都得喜歡將手去撫摸一下的；而瞧他的眼睛又好似從兩扇圓窗裏瞧到明藍的天色。總之，在他母親的眼中看來，眞是世界中最美麗的孩子。那一個孩子，却長着一頭黑色的鬆髮——在黑色中帶一些深藍，似是一頭烏鴉的毛羽。你倘瞧到他的眼中時，却好像在一條棕色的山溪深處瞧見空中的兩顆明星。總之，在他母親的眼中看來，他眞是世界中最美麗的孩子。　　這兩個孩子華樂，恰好是同日誕生的，但那黃頭髮的華樂，是一位高貴的國王的兒子，住在一座很富麗的王宮中，而那黑頭髪的華樂，却是一個窮苦的牧人的兒子，住在一所很矮小的草屋裏。　　那黃頭髮的華樂在開始學步時，是在光滑的地板上搖搖擺擺地走去，他要是一跌倒，就跌在那又軟又厚的地毯裏。在他的房間中，也沒有一些兒危險，連什麽桌子和椅子，也特別製造得毫無稜角，所以他從來沒有瞧見過身上有一些傷痕。　　但那黑頭髮的華樂開始學步的時候，可是不同了。他在那冰冷和不平的石地板上踏來踏去，那一個小小的房間，全是許多尖角的東西，因此常常會使他撞痛的。那堅硬的地板似乎爬起來拷打他，一會兒打在這裏，一會兒又打在那裏，他的母親把嘴來親着，使他忘却了苦痛。他很歡喜母親這樣的親着地，而樂於瞧他身上的許多傷痕，尤其是那兩個紅紅的膝蓋，總好像塗着一層楊梅醬一般。　　這兩個華樂也像普通的小孩子一樣，不願意上牀去安睡，可是他們又不得不睡。那黃頭髮的華樂，把他的頭納在一個大枕頭裏，柔軟得幾乎把他的鼻子也蓋沒了；而那黑頭髪的華樂，却枕在一個硬硬的小枕上，每天早上，他往往覺得耳朶也擦痛了。　　這兩個孩子都是愛吃愛喝的，黃頭髮的華樂，吃的都是美味可口的東西。你只要瞧他房間裏的桌子上，高高的堆滿着鮮美的水菓，五色斑爛的糕餅和果凍。他天天有童子雞吃，而所喝的茶中也總是加着果醬的。黑頭髪的華樂，却難得吃什麽可口的東西，除非是一些厚粥，一塊黑麵包和一小片鹹猪肉。然而他常常吃得津津有味，勝過王宮中的玉食萬方。因為他總是在極餓的時候才吃，所以分外的可口了。他的父親因為害了風濕病，躺着不能起身，所以那黑頭髪的華樂剛能走路，他就不得不掮着牧人的那根重重的杖，吹着口哨，帶同牧羊狗出去，看守他父親的羊羣。　　他瞧着那些羊，　　哼地呌着，一面嚼吃地上短草，頭頸裏的鈴子，隨着它們的動作在玲玲地作響。可憐這寂寞的小牧童每到冬天，往往在刻骨的冷風中打顫，每到夏天，都又在炙人的烈日下喘息着。他很願意留在家裏，靠着火爐讀一本書，一面瞧他的母親攪動着所煮的粥，這是多麽的舒服呀！蒼蠅  影天　　夏天到了，我們隨時隨地都可以聽到那些嗡嗡嗡的討厭的聲音，飛在四週；那，便是一切人類所認為可怕的蒼蠅。　　這是大家所公認的一種害蟲；而且，它們的生殖力也快得駭人，普通日常都能生殖，每一次產卵四五個不等。　　它們的生長，可分四個步驟：　　（一）卵（二）幼虫（三）蛹（四）成虫（見圖）　　它們的口器和一個管子似的，便於吮吸。污濁不堪的地方，便是它們的棲身之所；於是，每一隻蠅的脚下藏有千萬顆惡毒的病菌，飛到人們的食物上，人們便傳染着可怕的疾病了。　　我們不是時常看到它在平滑的玻璃上，及其他一切直立的物體上爬行嗎？因為它的脚下有一種富於勾黏性的吸盤，所以不會跌下來。　　蠅的種類，可分家蠅，靑蠅，麻蠅，等三種。除蠅的辦法：祇要把一切弄得淸潔，徘除污物，把垃圾桶蓋好了，時常用藥水噴射；以及用捕蠅器和蠅拍等來殺滅蠅的成蟲。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　業餘周刊外埠郵政代辦所臺灣人生活調查  林文煥　　厦門通訊　　儘管是一個善操方言的人，但對於福建的方言總很少能學得好的。雖然通行着的福建話大別之只有兩種，卽福州話和厦門話，但在閩南，則除厦門話較可通行於幾個大城市外，差不多每一縣，甚至每二個鄉鎭，都各有牠的方言。然而，那異邦的臺灣人，他們却通用着閩南的厦門話，為了這言語的易通，閩南遂成為臺灣人集中之地，逋逃之藪了。　　厦門自開闢商埠之後，因其為閩南漳江口門戶，商貨均集於此，因之僑民　集，五方雜處，市面日興。任何地方，均有一種慣例，一到繁華起來，必有烟賭妓館等應運而生。在厦門也是如此，所不同的就是，在厦門，此項事業的經營似乎已為臺灣浪人所獨覇了。　　當然，臺灣人在厦門和鼓浪嶼經營正當事業的，如銀行，醫院，酒店等，也未嘗不多，但終不及經營烟賭等業者之佔絕對多數。在厦門市內，有一條著名的「臺人街」，那是和美洲各地的「唐人街」命名相彷彿，據當地稱謂，則呌作「局口街」（與新闢的中山路相近）。在表面上，誰也看不出局口街竟是「藏垢納污」之地。比方，好好的一間精緻美覜的咖啡館，它的樓上竟有作為烟鬼們吞雲吐霧之所的。那其間的簡陋和齷齪，有很多到過上海的人都以為是不亞於上海的燕子窠。有時，一家富麗堂皇的公館，彷彿是在車水馬龍地請客，誰知道那正是一家賭塲生意在鼎盛着。衣冠楚楚，遠道而來的，無非是逐臭的賭客而已。妓館也不是公開掛牌招攬顧客，在表面上看來，差不多全是一家家的住宅。但一到夜色蒼茫，華燈初上，便免不了笙歌達且，鶼鶼鰈鰈者觸目皆是了。　　在那條街上，也如同華南港粤間的澳門，世界公園瑞士的蒙脫卡羅一樣，它不受甚麽當局政令的的束，因為經營這些事業的人都是很有體面的大族，它和官塲中人往往可以分庭抗禮的。據說厦鬥的臺人大族有著名的三姓：一是李姓，為三姓中之頂兒尖兒，潛勢力廣佈，資本雄厚；其次為林姓，以經營舞塲咖啡店者為最多，平日結交官紳，長袖善舞，威名震閩南；其三為高姓，則頗有强弩之末的情况，未足與李，林比也。　　上述三姓實握有厦市貿易中心之權，尤以最近為甚。蓋三姓俱臺籍土著，而又為强國保護下之子民。所聚徒衆，大多由臺逋逃入厦，類皆幹練狡黠，走慣江湖。除從事營業外，還作種種為人庇護之事。如有人須借招牌而營「特殊貿易」，只消向彼等接洽卽可，且往往能節省許多糜費，而可得切實保障。故其徒衆遂日多一日。　　臺籍更多浪人，其人品更在「特殊貿易」人物之下。於是販賣軍火，接濟土匪，亦在所不惜。據說：一個幹練的浪人，他能在一天之內，為一個新編的軍隊購得一師人用的快槍。　　臺籍的女人，高貴些的，也有嫁作外商婦要人妾者。中級的則善良者助夫經營正當商業，狡黠者則充「特殊貿易」助手。下焉者，則隨處賣唱賣淫，恬不知恥。這之中，也有一種尙保持着封建社會遺跡的「女班子街戲」。　　每到舊歷七月中旬，在俗稱「中元佳節」的時候，厦門市上的人也和別的地方一樣，大家忙着醵錢打太平公醮。街上到處懸褂些紙錢，紙衣褲等，飄飄然凌風而飛舞。一到夜間，便每家輪流着請「女班子」來唱戲，有時一直鬧到天亮。而所唱的戲多半還是流行於我國民間的「梁山伯祝英台」之類，但唱的人則全是臺籍婦女。　　好像是成了習慣吧？厦門的人是常常把這「臺灣戲」當作本鄉調似的，無論老少男女，如果無事哼呼的話，總是哼這種調。固然，這些戲多半也跳不出我國老套的「小姐贈金後花園，落難公子中狀元」，但唱這種街戲的她們究竟不是中國的人民，她們已成了强隣的被鞭策者。所以，往往在悽婉的歌聲中會使人想起唐人的詩句：「商女不知亡國恨，隔江猶唱後庭花！」　　旅厦台人總數共的五六萬人，今歲尙有陸續入口者。記者因台友甚多，故常被邀往局口街窺探神秘的佈置。現在先說賭的方面：　　他們的賭法可謂別出心裁，名為「十二樣」賭。十二樣者卽：白王，白仕，白相，黑王，黑仕，黑相，白車，白馬，白砲，黑車，黑馬，黑砲，類如棋子之十二記號。賭塲中之開寳處並不聚集多數賭客，僅有少數新加入人物常往當面看彩。其餘，欲賭者只消知道十二樣名稱，安居家中，預備好賭本，將欲賭之銀錢數目包於紙包內，紙包內並附帶自己所猜定之某樣（比如猜黑砲卽寫明賭三角錢黑砲），自然有該賭塲專派之跑街前來收取（編者按：頗像上海花會聽筒形式）。如果開彩時是黑炮，則猜黑炮所交去之三角錢中彩，可收回三元三角。（三元是贏的錢，三角是本，見一賠十也）。開彩時亦是把十二樣彌封而隨便抓了來開拆、且可分批開彩（如收了第一批的跑街回來，卽開一次；第二批又開一次）。做跑街的，可以兩邊拿錢。比方，跑街收到顧客的錢交到賭塲，可在每一元之中抽出一角為車費酬勞。如果中獎，還可以再向顧客索每元一角之酬勞花紅。假使顧客賭本大（假定是數百元）而中得數千元，那末，所出的幾百元本錢便統統送給跑街了。同時跑街又多半是賭塲老板黨徒，當他發現猜某一種「樣」的多時，便向老板通風報信，使他注意，也有的賭塲甚至舞弊作假，以坑害顧客。　　但在厦門，「十二樣」賭已成為日常生活中的一件大事，差不多每家人家總有一兩個嗜「十二樣」如命的，甚至有作孤注一擲，因而傾家蕩產者。　　不特是厦門人，連泉漳各屬以及閩北都有不少的人把厦門局口街當作銷金窟的，尤其是專講做官的閩北人來得最多。雖僅是彈丸之地，但都市的弊害則巳很顯著了。　　台籍妓館有時是同旅館咖啡店關係很深的。你如果在旅館中和老茶房商量好便可問津；咖啡店中如果有女招待的，那便有些意思了。往往，在舞塲式的咖啡店中，兼有妓館和旅館的設備；大些的，還兼有賭塲的設備（有時也有番攤及牌九之類）。至於妓女的來源，則有如下的幾種：　　一，養女：養女的性質同蓄婢沒有兩樣，小時候專門從事操作，做家庭的奴隸，長到十二三歲時，便從她的姿態美醜方面分出待遇的高低來。美的，便成了妓館的錢樹子，其次的，有些是轉賣到別處或者轉入女戲班等處去，有些則一輩予在院中做婢女了。不過，當那鴇母開始買養女的時候，大半在十歲左右，相貌總不致過於改變，所以醜的到很少。　　二，誘騙與被人拐賣者：妓院中用手段去誘騙來的婦女也有。被人拐騙而賣到院中的也很多。其中年齡較大者多屬此類。　　三，寄押者：有父母之女或童養媳，或有夫之婦，由經濟窘迫而寄押院中為妓者亦有，大都以三，五年為押期。押時彷彿賣，但有錢時可贖回。因人可生利，故押得之錢不取利息　　女戲班中的女戲子，以寄押者為多。　　鴉片烟完全是走私。據說除從閩西南進口外，也有從海船載來的。烟館老板多為台人，卽不是也要借招牌。地點多半在咖啡店樓上；旅館中也有；賭塲中也有，在賭塲中的賭客可以免費吸烟（包含鴉片，雪茄，香烟等）。　　局口街不特為閩省下野要人聚集處，也免不了是土匪消遣地。閩省以民軍著名；但所謂民軍，如未經中央招撫的，當然仍是匪了。所以局口街不特是台人逋逃藪，也是閩人逋逃藪　　慘殺的事情在局口街也很多，事態的擴大與消滅也往往出人於意料之外。如果我們要形容局口街，可以稱之為「特區」之一。　　但是，厦門市的上層與下層社會却暗地裏以局口街為歸趨，影饗者。如果為地方桑梓想，便會覺得那是一個燬滅厦門的噴火口。書報春秋評張益弘的「哲學槪論」  亮夫　　（該書最近由辛墾書店出版，定價九角）　　關於哲學概論這一類的著作，在坊間也可找得許多，有些是自己著的，有些是從西歐　譯來的，有些是根據人家的書為藍本而編纂成的，然而大體上說來都是承襲轉錄，一套舊哲學的體系，沒有新的意見表現。我們讀了這一類的哲學概論，彷彿覺得牠們都是千篇一律，一點也沒有新的內容。原來這類的哲學入門書並沒有給我們指示出現在新哲學的具體內容，也沒有運用高級的新哲學研究方法，而還只是泛論甚麽本體論呵，宇宙論呵，人生論呵等等陳腐的死去的哲學的空架，羅列一些一神論呵多神論呵獨斷論懷疑論呵等等舊哲學派系中的各種意見，牠並沒有站在新哲學的立塲，具體地把握着當前的活生生的哲學的內容。　　最近出了一本張益弘著的「哲學概論」。近數年來，關於哲學入門這類的書已經沒有人著述了，也許是一般研究哲學的人，在舊的方面的，威覺到從前的哲學體系已經够了，無再另行建立之必要；在新的方面的，不是感覺到改弦更張，自成一格之困難，便是認為前人所論的等等新哲學綱要已經完備，用不着再來依樣書葫蘆。所以張益弘這部哲學概論，在現在總算是打破了這個多年的沈默。　　自然，這部哲學概論也有牠的與衆不同的地方。例如其他許多書，內面所論列的只是觀念論一派系中的各家意見，如一神論，多神論等，從沒有提到物質論，更沒有提到辯證物質論的。這可見牠們完全是舊哲學的哲學概論，觀念論的哲學概論，是過去的哲學的哲學概論，决不是眞正地當前的哲學概論。但</p>
<p>Page 20</p>
<p>我們現在這本書，雖然在體制上也是承襲舊哲學概論的排列，然而到底於每一章或每一節的末尾，在把各家意見敘述了時，也提出新興的物盤論來，並不讓觀念論的哲學意見就完全佔據了哲學概論的全領域，也把新物質論抬出來同觀念論分庭抗禮，平分天下。這一點算是本書與其他哲學概論不同的地方，也表示出著者之注意到辯證物質論或偏向於辯瞪物質論。　　但是我們認為只是這樣還是不够的。根據本書一貫的方法，在討論每一意見中，只是把各家各派的說法敘述過後，再把辯證物質論去統一牠，似乎各種意見都各有是處，都各應永久保留，兼收並蓄，儲藏在新物質論中。而且在有許多地方並沒有發表一點自己的意見，只是同舊哲學者一樣，完全羅列敷陳各家的意見，提供一些材料而已，並沒加以抉擇和批判。根據這些，我們知道作者的立塲只是有意無意地不知不覺地意識到了辯證物質論，並沒有堅决地站在新物質論的立塲去批判以前舊哲學上所有的意見。他只想統一，折衷，調和：他忽略了克服，否定。　　還有就是關於體裁方面。自然，形式是為內容所規定的。因為本書還不能完全脫出舊的哲學概論的體系，所以仍然把哲學的內涵分做認識論，宇宙論，本體論，人生論幾部門。雖然著者在本書上面說過，「本體論與宇宙論統一於自然哲學之中」，「稱為自然哲學，則與自然科學相當」，而「人生哲學（人生論—著者註）則為社會科學的內容」，但是說儘管說，而本哲學概論之體制還是要列有本體論，宇宙論，人生論幾項。我想本書著者也是讀過恩格斯的著作吧？恩格斯不是明明說過嗎？「領會了二千五百年間的哲學發展的成果之後，自然科學一方面可以脫離特殊的，離牠而立，處牠之上的自然哲學……」又說：「因為自然哲學的長足進步，……我們就可以拿經騐的自然科學本身所提供的材料，製成一個整個自然界現象相互連繫的圖表。……現在人們只要觀察那以辯證法方法去研究自然界所得的結果，卽研究各種自然界過程間相互連繫所得的結果，已經可以得着現時代够用的一個自然界系統，……於是自然哲學也就確定地被消除了。」所以「與自然科學相當」的自然哲學，卽張先生之所謂本體論和宇宙論「也就確定地被消除了」。恩格斯又說：「這個歷史觀（物質論史論）結果了整個歷史的哲學，亦如自然界的辯證法觀使一切自然界的哲學都成為無用的和不可能的一樣。」那麽「為社會科學的內容」的人生哲學還有存在之餘地嗎？所以「哲學從自然界和歷史中被驅逐出來以後，只剩下一個地域可以給牠藏身了。這個地域就是純粹思想：研究思想規律的學說—邏輯和辯證法。」而辯證法又是自然社會和思惟之運動的一般的規律，所以現在哲學的任務是在研究這一點。共具體的內容則為辯證法的物質論和物質論的辯證法。甚麽本體餘呵，宇宙論呵，人生論呵，都是舊哲學的哲學概論的內容。這一點是本書著者所不明白的，也是和舊哲學落於同窩臼的地方。　　但是，著者雖然仍把舊哲學中之人生哲學和自然哲學抬在哲學概論之上，然而在他論到哲學的去向時，却又結論出哲學之消滅，同以前和現在許多主張哲學消滅論的人一樣。如果明白了以前的哲學是些甚麽內容，又朋白現在的哲學內容是甚麽，那我想就會知道新哲學是有其特殊的地域的，卽是研究「邏輯和辯證法。」也許這一點又是張先生矯枉過正的地方吧？恩格斯只是說從前的自然哲學和歷史哲學「已被消除了」，「古典哲學」到了「末日」了，决沒有說新哲學，「邏輯和辯證法」已到了末日。張先生一要鋪張哲學的內容時，便不惜將那已被消除的古典哲學中之自然哲學和人生哲學都拉進來，一要否定哲學時，便連那「剩下一個地位可以給牠藏身」的邏輯和辯證法這種哲學也一概趕出去，那麽張先生又何必要來做這一部哲學概論呢？依前者，已有舊哲學概論在，何必另作？依後者，哲學都沒有了，那裏來的哲學概論？　　上面是隨便提出我對本書不能贊同的兩個主要意見，這也是本書內重要的兩點。至於其他細節目，値得商量的也很多，此地不能再說了。不過同坊間一般的哲學概論比起來，這本書對於一般讀者說來，倒是更整齊，更通俗；其排列分明，分配勻稱，還是其餘的事。而且對於新哲學也略略指出了一些，並有引導讀者偏向牠的用意，這可算是本書最特色的地方了。播音節目　　上海市（九○○）每日節目　　上午　　一一·四五　愛國音樂（黨歌　自勵　破波成行　美哉中華　保國　蘇武牧羊）　　一二·○○　報時　西樂　　下午　　○·三○　氣象　上週重要新聞　西樂　　一·○○　休息　　四·一五　粵曲（驚濤　巧梳妝　吳宫醉舞　寶鴨穿蓮　小桃紅）　　四·三○　口琴（中華口琴會）（一）雙鷹進行曲（二）金婚曲（三）湖畔明月，波拉波，（四）賣花女探戈舞，（五）春之微笑　　五·○○　防空淺説　　五·三○　平劇（探母坐宫四段　法門寺　宇宙鋒　洪羊洞　大保國）　　六·○○　歌唱（漁光曲　鋤頭歌　歡烏樂　大地進行曲）　　六·三○　新聞　氣象　國際貿易介紹　消息　　六·五○　歌唱（大路歌　開路先鋒　郊遊　慈母心　自由神之歌本事歌）　　七·三○　平劇（孝感天　忠孝全　荒山淚四段　武家坡）　　八·○五　預報明日節目　　八·一○　停止海外通訊網土耳其故宮巡禮  賀榮宗　　士坦保爾通訊　　士坦保爾，卽舊日的君士坦丁，為土耳其的舊都。它與斯庫寳台相對，中間隔着有名的博斯破魯斯海峽。因為這海峽是黑海和地中海的咽喉，歐亞交通的要道，所以士坦保爾和斯庫寳台在地勢上都非常重要。大戰以後，洛桑條約會規定這博斯破魯斯海峽和韃靼尼爾海峽二岸解除武裝及海峽由特設的國際委員會管理；最近引起全世界人注意的蒙德婁會議，便是討論的土耳其要求海峽設防的問題。目前這裏的土耳其人民都在熱烈希望海峽實行設防，收回他們的權利，恢復士坦保爾和博斯破魯斯海峽的舊觀。　　但是，這士坦保爾的一般情形怎樣呢？　　從海船上看來，士坦保爾是非常美觀，壯麗的；特別是在夜問，在輝煌的電燈照耀着一層一層的近代建築的情况下，看來眞有點像香港。但是，當你登岸走進這都市的時候，便一切都會使你戚到失望了。這里的街道有許多都是很狹小而且不整潔的，與近代的大都市幾乎完全兩樣；在旅館中，尤其是暑天，首先和你親近的便是臭虫和跳蚤，使你終夜無法安眠。　　這里的人大多有一種怪迷信，卽是他們相信犬和許多獸類是神的侍從，必要好好的飼養，不然便要受神的懲罰。據說有一個時期這里的犬非常多，直到大戰爆發後才由英國軍隊將幾十萬隻犬一齊捕去，放逐到馬爾馬拉的一個孤島上；這個島後來卽呌放大島。現在這里的犬的確很少了，但貓却又非常多，幾乎隨處都可以聽到咪咪的呌聲，隨處都可聞到貓糞的臭味；這也許是因為貓還沒有遭遇過一網打盡的大檢舉吧。　　不過，士坦保爾也有許多名勝可以參觀，如舊的皇宮，尤其是那中間的大寳庫，就是在別處所難得見到的。這個地方在過去是被封鎖着的，未得土爾其皇帝的准許，任何人都不能進去一看。從土耳其最後的皇帝謨罕默德五世至現今的大總統凱末爾，不知道經過了好多波折，到現在才好容易全部開放了，就是外國人也可隨意進去參觀。　　在皇宮內最為遊人所注意的大寳庫中，收藏了許多珍奇貴電的寳物。首先可以使任何人望而却步的，是培爾西亞皇帝的王座。這王座據說是建造於一五〇一年，當培爾西亞皇帝愛斯馬利亞一世在位的時侯。牠是由黃金製成的，它的四脚都鑲嵌着無數同一色彩的眞珠寳石，上面還覆着一個巨大的水晶蓋；看起來輝煌奪目，眞像一座寳山。此外，還有一個同樣的王座，也是黃金製的，也鑲嵌着許多金鋼石，紅玉，錄玉，眞珠等寳物。但這王座上面覆着的不是水晶蓋，而是黃金製的圓蓋，在這圓蓋，還吊着一把嵌有綠玉的金鎖，牠的大小說來也有點驚人，單是它的末端就有六英寸長，二英寸厚，而且，在它上面還鐫的有回教的聖經文句。　　當我們凝視着這兩個王座的時候，總想伸手去摸摸，總想把它移動，移到自己面前來；有時甚至也情不自禁地想去坐坐，嘗一嘗坐在那上面究竟是一種什麽味兒。眞的，在看到這樣寳貴的王座時，就要發生當皇帝的幻想；誰不想作皇帝呢？假使可能的話。　　在那樣的兩個王座旁邊，有一個水晶製的櫃子，那中間收藏的不是別的物品，而是巨大的三個綠玉和許多寳物。此外還陳列的有許多黃金製的並嵌有寳物的刀鞘，以及無數的鎧甲，短刀，寳劍等，光芒射目，令人心驚胆戰　　但是，上面所說，只是實庫的第一室的情形，此外還有第二室，又呌做寳玉室。室內有十二隻水晶缸，都是高七八寸的；那中間所藏的全是金鋼石，眞珠，綠玉，紅玉，靑玉等寳物。此外還有幾塊大石，是以細碎的玉鐫着各種各樣的花紋或獸類的形態的；因為光芒閃動，所以看來像是幾隻巨獸在那裏轉動它的眼睛。不過，這裏最有價値的，我以為還是從十六世紀以來的許多鐘表，這可以使人看出近代文明發展所經過的各階段；而且，在那無數的鐘表中，有一隻從一七四〇年遺傳下來的時鐘，它一天要發出二十四種不同的聲音，向人們報告時刻；這不僅是珍品，而且是在科學上，文化上最有價値的東西。　　總之，皇宮大實庫的珍貴物品是很多的，一時說也說不盡；假使你要來士坦保爾的話，就希望你先去參觀這個地方。書報介紹介紹「文學界」  吉崇　　—定價每册大洋二角，代售處四馬路光明書店——　　最近中國出現的文學雜誌，恐怕比新文學運動以來的任何時期出現的還要多，這是每一個文學愛好者都可感覺到的。現在我們所要介紹的，便是在新出現的許多文學雜誌中値得注意的「文學界」，希望由此能使讀者對於最近的中國文壇有一個大概的了解。　　當前中國文學界所提出的一個最新的問題，卽是大家已經熟知的「國防文學」問題。對於這個問題「文學界」是以最多的篇幅來討論和實踐的。如創刊號中何家槐的「文藝界聯合問題我見」，周揚的「關於國防文學」，周木齋的「水滸傳和國防文學」，第二期中郭沫若的「國防，污池，煉獄」，艾思奇的「新的形勢和文學的任務，魯迅的「論現在我們的文學運動」，茅盾的「關於論現在我們的文學運動」，黃峯的「國防文學在蘇聯」等論文，都是建立和發展國防文學的理論的。在創作方面，多數作品的思想內容可說都是國防文學的意識。這樣，如果要問「文學界」的特點，那第一便是在於國防文學的提倡和建立。　　在討論國防文畢的那些論文中，値得特別提出來談論的共有三篇：第一是周揚的「關於國防文學」，這對於國防文學的反對者的意見有明確的批判；第二是艾思奇的「新的形勢和文學的任務」，在這中間，作者指出了目前形勞的特點，並依此闡明了國防文學的意義和任務；第三是郭沫若的「國防，污池，煉獄」，我以為這是自「國防文學」的口號提出後，最好最明白的一篇解說道文學的文章——作者在這兒除了對於國防文學給與一般說明外，並對於「愛國主義」作了正確的解說：他一面揭露了「內聯國賊」「外媚强權」的「污池」式的「愛國主義」者和「臥鋼絲床」「嘗龍肝鳳膽」的勾踐主義者的眞面目，一面更亳不含混地指出：「在目前的中國，只有進步的現實主義者才是眞正的愛國主義者，而眞正地有愛國熱情的人，他所走的路也就是進步的現實主義的路」。這樣，問題的各方面不是都明明白白地顯露出來了嗎？　　至於國防文學的創作，則有穆哥的「某校的一日」，舒羣的「沙漠中的火花」和「萧苓」，徐懋庸的火熖……等。就中我以為舒羣的兩篇値得特別評價。據說作者是東北人，亡國的痛苦是已經實際受過的，所以他的作品能很自然地流露出抗敵的熱情。「沙漢中的火花」和「蕭苓」的題材也是作者所身受的東北等地民衆的亡國慘劇，由此所表現出的抗敵思想和熱情也非常眞實，與那些坐在家里幻想出來的反帝文學完全兩樣。我們看了這兩篇作品後，所感覺到的是：在故事的發展過程中沒有離奇的地方，一切事變的出現都是很自然的，但在這中間，却把敵人的橫暴，漢奸奴才的無恥，眞正愛國者英勇的反抗熱情都一幕一慕地活現出來了。作者所用的詞句雖很樸素，雖沒有特別能煽動人的什麽警句，但看了之後却可使你感動，興奮，燃燒起同樣的反抗熱情。例如，對於「讀書救國」主義者的諷刺和責駡，過去也有一些作品是表現出了這點的，但那些表現多半是依靠激烈的詞句和理論的說教，或者虛構的故事，而舒羣的「萧苓」的表現則是由於事件的自然的發展。還作品吿訴我們，當敵兵尙未打到自己身邊時，有一位張訓育員卽大談其「讀書救國」，但當敵兵已經到來，她吩咐校役快燒國旗時，一位眞正愛國的女生却冷冷地說：「你怎麽不說「讀書救國」啦」。這是多麽簡潔而有力！自然，這兩篇創作也有一些缺點，如在許多地方的描寫的過分簡略，開快車，使人覺得作者的表現力還不够，但最後說來，作者仍可說是新進作家中之最有希望的一個。　　除上述的之外，在「文學界」中還有兩篇創作是値得一讀的，卽沙汀的「在祠堂里」和郭沬若的「司馬遷發憤」，尤其是後者。這應該是歷史小說，是作者藉着司馬遷被割掉睾丸後努力作史記的事來諷刺，嘲罵一般權勢的，他以司馬遷的嘴，在述說了秦始皇巴結有錢的烏氏倮和巴寡婦之後，說道：「向着書籍放火，向着牛羊叩頭，向着讀書人頭上酒尿，向着有錢的寡婦捧玉帶，這便是權勢啦！……文學家假如有烏氏倮巴寡婦那樣的富豪，權勢自行割掉卵袋子來奉仕文學，那裏會讓文學被割掉卵袋子去奉仕權勢？」這樣無情的嘲罵，我想就是現在的漢武帝和任少卿之流聽見了也要面紅耳赤吧。作者是很長於用歷史的故事來創作的，如過去的「三個叛逆的女性」等，都頗有名，這裏我們還可順便介紹一篇作者的歷史小說，也可說是歷史小品，卽「雜文」第四期上的「秦始皇將死」，那是寫得更好，更生動，而且更有現實意義的。　　復次，對於報告文學的理論介紹，在一文學界」創刋號中有兩篇文章：Plere　Merin的「報告文學論」（徐懋庸譯）和Andre　Marlux的「報告文學的必要」（沈起予譯）。前者指出了報告文學表現客觀眞實的方法是最輕便，最直接，最迅速的，說明了寫作報告文學的辯證的道路：「就是從實際的觀察，到抽象的思想，然後再轉到客觀的現實的實騐」；因而並理淪地表現出了報告文學的積極意義和任務。在這　　以下接第五版</p>

<p>中間，對於從巴爾扎克，左拉到辛克萊，基希等報告文學作家都有簡要的批判。至於後者，卽「報告文學的必要」，則是理論地實際地證明了報告文學的存在意義及其積極作用的。同時，「文學界」還刊載了基希的報告文學作品：「秘密的中國」（立波譯）。這位作者是一個所謂「快步的報告文學家」，他的報告文學作品是被認為當今世界最優秀的。這裏的「秘密的中國」，是由許多描寫中國現實的社會現象的報告文學作品所集成，現在已刊出了三篇：「士兵慕地的吉原」「污泥」（創刋號）和「紗廠童工」（第二期），據說以後還要陸續刊出：這不僅可以使我們能實際地理解報告文學的創作形式之特點，而且能使我們眞實地知道中國社會的許多「秘密」。　　最後要說的是「創作月評」和「座談會」，這也可說是「文學界」的一個特點。我會說，在近來的中國，批評與創作已經分離了，因為批評家都不大理睬現實的新產生的創作，他們喜歡談荷馬，但丁，歌德，拜倫；同時作家也覺得這批評與他無直接關係，因之也不願去理睬批評；所謂批評與創作的發展，可說是未在一起的。現在「文學界」旣有「創作月評」的設立，對於這個缺點當有相當的補救，希望該刊以後能繼續努力，直到將這缺點完金克服為止。自然，這個工作是有點喫力不討好的，但它的意義却很重大：它可以振興批評，幫助創作。至於創刋號中梅雨的幾篇短的評論，說來雖是太簡單，太不充分，但作者能在目前的中國不畏艱難地開始嘗試這個工作，也是値得佩服的。其次是評論創作的座談會的設立，這也有與「創作月評」同樣重大的意義。創刊號中所載的「賽金花座談會」（劇作者協會主催），對於「賽金花」這劇作的批評大部分都可說是很恰當的；就中凌鶴的意見尤其値得注意。我們希望以後能多來一些道樣的座談會，最好是每期都有一次，實行集體地評價新生的文藝作品乃至新生的作家。雜文點心考  費　　湯丸　命名為丸，以粉襲成圓形，望而團圓之意也。事物紺珠謂為周公所創。又開元遺事云：「宮中於端午造粉丸角黍，貯於盤中，以小角弓射之，中者得食。　　麻丸　相傳孫公劉氏所製，公劉氏為殷時御膳夫，故創始較湯丸尤古，—亦見事物紺珠。　　粽　別名角黍，相傳漢武中長沙太守區曲所創。某日區曲夢見一士人，自稱日三閭大夫，謂曲曰：「蒙君祭甚惠，但常為蛟龍所竊取，當以棟箬塞其上，以綠絲裏之，」（此二物蛟龍所憚）曲依其言而製之，今五月五日作粽子，卽共遺風也。然考太平御覽引吳苑云：「屈原之婦，作稷子以祭大夫，」則粽子似非始於區曲矣。　　糕　按糕古謂之粢。周禮疏云：「羞邊之食，糗餌粉粢是也。」至鄭箋始有糕之名。宋子京九日題糕，歲時紀載：「都人九月九日以菊糕相饋。」李肇李翰林志：「每歲重陽，內賜酒糖粉糕。」又陶穀淸異錄：「皇都僧舍傍有糕作坊，主人郭兢，大有金帛，入貲為員外郞，人呼之糕員外，」是業糕者且能得官也。又崔實四令民食錄云：「寒食啖棗糕，」觀此，則糕不僅用之於重九矣。　　饅頭　相傳饅頭始於諸葛武侯，唐人稱為籠餅。徐君山倦游雜記曰：「世稱籠餅卽饅頭，此物原出於諸葛武侯，當日祭神，以代人首者也。按武侯征蠻人時，日必殺一人，以首祭山神，冀得神助，後武侯不忍，乃用羊豕等肉，以麵粉像人面之形，名之日饅頭。」然今之饅頭，有饀以白糖，豆酥，猪油者，則與原意不無逕庭矣。　　包子　張光漢燕翼貽謀錄云：「宋仁宗生辰，賜羣臣以包子，」並謂包子卽饅頭之別名，蓋古者生日多食包子也。然近人生日每進長壽包麵，此則為南宋以後之風俗矣。　　餛飩　相傳古塞外有運屯二氏，所製炊餅，謂之餛飩，此唐人之說也（見中華古今注）。又考歐陽修歸田錄：「國朝飲食名號，隨時俗言而異，餛飩唐人謂之「不托」，近人俗謂之「餛繁飩」，此實北音之轉也。」由此可知餛飩本為胡品，非華人所創也。業餘咖啡座性與女人  豈文　　讀達爾文「人類的系統」，有一節論及雌雄淘汰的文字，覺得很有趣味：　　「因此許多生物，為了『生之快樂』，常帶着色香味聲等特色，作為勾引對手的條件。鳥獸的羽毛，草木的花等，無非是為生殖目的而生得美麗的。所謂麝香，乃產生於一種鹿的雄性的生殖器問，這種奇特的香氣無非也是誘惑雌性的一種手段。不僅麝香鹿如此，在獸類之中，為達生殖目的以香惑雌者不少。」　　人，也是與禽獸同源的生物之一種，在性的機能上原也無別於高等的諸動物。只是人類總算是披了一件「文明」與羞恥的外衣，往往在一切性行為上常加隱秘。芥川龍之介說：「人的性慾關係所以異於禽獸者，是因為成功一種詩的表現，如「有女懷春，吉士誘之；求之不得，輾轉反側。」這是一種。「畫堂南畔見一晌偎顫，戚郎不羞郞，迥身就郞抱。」這也是一種。或是承襲了西廂記上酬簡的慣技，或者跪了一條腿，讀英文詩，種種，卽可謂詩的表現吧！」無怪乎克士先生在「戀愛與貞操」中要說男女的戀愛如同貓捕魚一樣，雖因此曾引起許多先生女士們的爭辯，其實假使僅在學理上作為一種研究或闡理，克士先生的意思誠可贊同，但若因此使一般在熟戀中的男女將美夢驚醒，憬然若有所失，則亦未免缺望了。　　至於麝香鹿之散奇香，這恐怕在人類性關係上也不乏類似的例子。海關報告進口之香水香粉等化妝品，達一百四十萬元的驚人數目，有的人懷疑這是中國人性慾亢進的證據，也有的人竟將國難的責任都借此推到了女子的糜費上。魯迅說：「其實那不是女人的罪狀，眞是她的可憐。這社會制度把她擠成各種谷式的奴隸，還要把種種罪名加在她頭上。西漢末年，女人的墮馬鬍，愁眉啼妝，也說是亡國之兆，其實亡漢的何嘗是女人。」　　女人天生是愛美的，加上「女為悅己者容」，女人的美的觀念，也常以男人眼光中所認為美的程度為迎合的標準的。這難道說男人能完全脫離干係嗎？叔本華曾悲觀的浩嘆道；「大自然對少女們好像早已存心設下羅網，用戲劇中的話頭來說，呌做一種開塲吸人的效力；短短的幾年里面牠賦她們以豐盈的美，濫賜以動人的魔力，不惜置她們一生共餘的一切於不顧；如此，在這幾年內，她們可以顚倒男子到那麽一種程度，驅策他趕緊光榮的為她們服勞，……終她們的一生，——這一路幹的似乎一些也不會有充分的祖保，要是單只理性領導着男子思想的話。……大自然在這里，如在無論那里，一本其慣常的經濟手段幹去；正猶雌蟻受胎以後失去她的翅膀，翅磅那時是嫌多的，甚至危及生育的；女子產了一二個孩子以後也大概失去她的美；眞恐怕為了同樣的緣故吧。」　　造物是否因女子生來須負担這担子才帶來暫刻的美，等到她嫁過了人，為男人生過了孩子，這樣就算完了她的人之使命？為了否定這一切，於是女人要求解放，要求職業，然而女人們衝向男人的羣中，獲得了些什麽？據我們所看到的，彷彿只有娼妓這門行業倒非常多，同時略含有娼妓成分的如女招待之類也不見少，或者，如要人的秘書，機關的花瓶……，女人一貫的仍在性的誘力里支持着她的生活。　　以前的男人希望女人為他多生幾個孩子，現在大公司招收女職員，食堂游藝塲招收女招待，他們的心理與女子的丈夫希望她們多生幾個小孩又有什麽兩樣呢？　　然而女人今後的路途在那里呢？陳衡哲女士說：「婦女運動現在是到了一個盤根錯節的時期了，我們還能浪費那百年來先知先覺為我們爭來一點小小的地位與權利和道德上的勢力呢？我們一方面聽到希特拉所代表的「回到你們的原來世界去」的反動呼聲，看到那殘賊人性的舊禮教的重新抬頭，一方面又眼見許多女子投降到那粗俗醜惡的好萊塢的人生觀的麾下去，把自己的天才與婦女的前途都浪費到一個變相的買賣市塲中去；我們該發生什麽威想，什麽决心？一這只有倍倍爾回答我們的話最好。「我們以為一切婦人，不問她社會地位如何，在社會進化的過程上都受着男子的壓迫和虐待，所以改變現存國家的法律制度和社會組織，以解除她們的不便，才是婦人全體的共同利益。」世界知識世界最長之國—智利  素才　　熱帶和寒帶是位置在南北兩極端的；但世界上有一個最長的國家，它的北部是在熱帶，南部却鄰近寒帶；這個國家便是南美的智利共和國。同時，又因為國境多火山，雪山，硝石及銅的產量很豐富，農產物很富饒，所以，這個世界上最長的國家又有「雪國」，「火山之國」，「硝石之國」，「銅國」及「穀倉」等名稱。　　聞名世界的南美安達斯山，從北到南地經過智利的全境，成為它與阿根廷的天然界限。這　長大的山脈有許多秀麗的山峯，遠遠望去，好像有許多高入雲端的白塔紛立着一樣。但是，這些山峯多是火山，常常噴着火熖；最近的大噴火更是這些火出所表現的新紀錄。　　火山很多的國家，常有發生地震的可能。在智利，過去也曾發生過幾度地震，損害了許多人的生命和財產。近來因為各火山都有爆發的危險，而近代科學知識又還沒有解除這種危險的可能，所以此間的人都非常恐懼，恐懼大地震災難的來臨！　　說到智利的鑛產，如硝石及銅煤金銀等的開採歷史是很早的；就中特別是銅鑛的發現和開發，尤有頗有興味的歷史。據這里一般的傳說：大的是在一百年以前，卽在一八一四年時，南美各地發生了狂熱的民族獨立運動，波及到了這個世界上最長之國智利；當時智利獨立軍有一個將校，在為了使智利脫離西班牙的蘭加庫之戰中大敗了，結果被迫逃匿於安達斯山中；但是，這位民族英雄在山中偶然發見了銅鑛，及到他獲得自由時，更使這個發見成為了智利銅鑛實際開採的開始；現在智利的爾·特琴特銅鑛區，便是這樣為人所知的。這座銅山是世界最大的銅山；它位置在智利的中央；鑛區之長達三六八籽，鑛井深到十四層，並有許多地道橫在安達斯山中二，五〇〇乃至三，五〇〇米的地下。它每日所產的銅量，有二萬二千瓩。這樣的銅鑛，它的規模之犬，不消說是可完全想見的。但不幸的是這個銅鑛現刻却是在美國資本支配之下；因之，每一個智利的人民看見美帝國主義採掘他們的銅鑛時，都好像覺得在挖他們的心肝樣，是非常難過的。　　銅鑛區的中心都市名呌塞維爾。這都市位置在海拔二五〇〇呎的高處；若與普通建立在平原上的城市比較起來，那牠眞可說是高空的都市，所謂「空中樓閣」。在這個都市中，有用機械的工廠，有一層一層的街道，有許多大大小小的商店；都市的住民多是鑛區的勞動者，他們的總數在一萬以上。至於勞動者們的住宅，也都用鑛石築成，看來倒好似磚瓦修的。但他們的生活却和一般勞動者一樣痛苦，他們在地下工作，每日所得僅足以果腹；在這高山城市的街道上，我們平時所遇見的那些從鑛裏出來的眼中無光的人們，大都垂頭喪氣，好像非常疲乏的樣子；但當嗚嗚的氣笛聲傳出，他們一齊下工時，却又可以看出那一羣平素眼中無光的人的活精神來：這也許是因為氣笛的聲音是他們聚會團集的信號，是他們獲得解放的最先的泡聲吧。　　最後還須的略談一談的，是智利的首都三地牙哥。這個都市位置在智利的中部，的有七十萬人口，為南美著名都市之一。在這七十萬居民中，大多為西班牙人的後裔，他們奉舊教，說西班牙話，有許多生活形式也與西班牙人的相類似，這不消說是因為智利原來是西班牙殖民地的緣故。不過，這裏用英語說話大致也可通行，因為英美人的勢力在這裏的也不小；當然，若要接近一般居民，要考察他們的生活，那却是非會說西班牙話不可的。　　現在，這個世界上最長之國，火山之國，銅之國，雖然早已脫離了西班牙的統治，但它的政治經濟却是為美國的金元所支配的。就在國都三地牙哥，雖也有近代式的百貨商店，大工廠，大建築，大銀行，但在這些東西的背後，却隱藏着侵略殖民地的帝國主義者的鬼臉；同時，一般居民的住宅建築及生活形式也很落後，那情形與一般殖民地和半殖民地的都差不多。應時文章摩登小姐夏季露營須知　（一）  靑軍　　夏季，正是和大自然接觸的最適宜的季節，正是作有益身心的運動最便利的時候；露營運動也就是其中之一。你只消一幻想到在山上，或是在郊外，或是在海濱露營時的情景，已能使你悠然神往了。可是露營雖能使你樂而忘返，但也往往同時要遭遇到許多討厭又而困難的問題，所以，若果在事先沒有各方面的準備，也許你在露營期間便會對這運動發生不快，甚至嫌惡，而不願再作第二次的露營。因為假如沒有準備的話，到那時便會感覺到種種的不便，或是鍗時為陽光曬得面目全非了。現在特地依照經騐所得，寫下出發露營前應注意的數點如下：　　首先，切不可忘帶除臭藥水和滑石粉，且必須把它們安置在安穩的地方，若果能有一隻琺瑯質的漂亮的小箱子，安放所有的雪花膏，粉，以及一切美容用品，那是更好了；不過，這種箱子選擇的最重要的條件，便是它必須能在旅行時期，無論怎樣顚簸搖勤，而這箱子仍能安全地不致傾覆為要。因為這些美容用品在露營期中特別有用，而這一隻箱子也可以暫時作為小梳妝臺之用。假如這種箱子選擇得適合的，它能永遠保持這些美容品瓶子等的平穩：反之，若果對於這種箱子的選擇馬虎從事，那末，便後患匪淺了，因為動不動，這些一瓶子等等便會翻倒，使美容品傾瀉滿地。　　有一點亦須加以注意。當準備出發露營之先，必須預備好一種防備被地上蟲類可咬的藥水，尤其是在月亮和星星底下躺看，更切不可缺少：假如你等到躺在地上已被蟲類咬着，才趕忙搽藥水，貼橡皮膏，到這時，非特興味索然，且為時也太遲了。因此，一瓶以歐薄荷油（Oil　of　lavender）作主劑的搽擦藥水决不可少，因為它能保護肌膚不致為蟲類所可咬。每天晨起洗浴後，將此種藥水搽遍週身，尤其是兩隻腿上更須留意，因為在夏季的露營期間是赤脚的季節，通常都不穿襪子的。（完未）</p>

He has always been appreciated and greatly admired his great personality and his detailed plans for the country. In the past seven or eight years, Chairman Chiang has been very generous to the Third Route Army. He should support it publicly and privately. Chairman Chiang also knows and understands that Shandong is in a difficult situation. Han did not indicate that he would go to Qingdao recently, nor would he go elsewhere. He is paying attention to the Yellow River flood control matters in Jinan and hopes that there will be no breach again this year. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e19">Further Efforts <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— Suitable</p>
<p>The situation in Guangdong and Guangxi has stabilized. China, except for the areas occupied by the Japanese army, can be considered completely unified. At this time when the military, political, and economic strength of the whole country is concentrated, and at this time when friendly countries have added a lot of hope to us, what new steps should our diplomacy take?</p>
<p>We will never recognize any facts that infringe on our country's sovereignty and territory, and we will never sign any treaties that infringe on our country's sovereignty and territory. We have always adhered to such a defensive line in diplomacy, but in the end we have only been able to withstand the various oppressions we have suffered in diplomacy in recent years. We have not yet used the weapons of diplomacy to liberate the entire nation from the suffering caused by various unequal treaties and so-called "faits accomplis." This requires further efforts from us.</p>
<p>We should hurry up and make these further efforts now. Otherwise, we will eventually not be able to hold on to our inherent diplomatic front. Why? Because the imperialists who embrace the continental policy will obviously not have a day of satisfaction. They will never easily let us hold on to a certain front. Many of their past actions can prove this point. Of course, it is still the same now. For example, the semi-official declaration recently issued by the Japanese Tripartite Conference, as well as the large-scale activities of the Inner Mongolia puppet army, and the news that the Japanese navy regularly conducts exercises in the waters off Fujian, all directly or indirectly indicate that they still want to use intimidation and threats to break through our diplomatic defensive line.</p>
<p>In the current environment, in any case, we must consider new diplomatic steps. What new steps are the most correct and appropriate? Since passing through Mr. Sun Yat-sen's edict, we should still be able to think of it in our minds. By adopting this diplomatic step to strive for all the sovereignty that an independent country should have, we are convinced that we, such a great nation, have sufficient strength.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Japanese Army Establishes Air Force Command, Unifying Air Force Command Matters, Standing Side-by-Side with the General Staff and Education Departments <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to strengthen national defense and expand the air force, the army has decided to create an air force corps, and it will be implemented from August 1st. The Army Ministry announced it this afternoon. According to the army authorities, in order to seek the rapid progress of aviation and make modern national defense flawless, an air force corps headquarters will be established, and the flight regiments that are now affiliated with each division will be under the jurisdiction of the air force corps. On the 24th, the order for the air force corps headquarters was presented to the emperor and approved, and it will be implemented from August 1st. The current army aviation has not yet escaped the era of the end of the European War when it was active as the eyes and ears of the army. However, the situation of aviation in the great powers has changed greatly, and it has become the most elite force, undertaking important tasks in national defense. The air force organization and formation are epoch-making activities, which is well known. Although the Japanese army aviation has added modern elements in the meantime, it must go a step further to ensure the perfection of national defense. Therefore, it will be under the jurisdiction of the air force corps, and the flight regiment will be separated from each division and become the air force corps. It seems to be isolated from the army, but in fact it is to make the powerful air force a force with the most effective ground operations.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, the official gazette announced the revision of the Army Aviation Headquarters Order. The main points are as follows: (1) From now on, all aviation-related matters that were previously scattered among the Army Ministry and the Technical Headquarters will be under the jurisdiction of the Army Aviation Headquarters.</p>
<p>(2) From August 1st, an Air Force Corps Headquarters will be newly established in Tokyo. The Air Force Chief of Staff, for the sake of experimentation or research, deems it necessary, in addition to the Director-General of Education, the Army Commander, and the Divisional Commander, may consult with the Air Force Corps Commander. According to this amendment, the Air Force Headquarters has become a major central agency in fact due to the expansion of aviation, standing shoulder to shoulder with the General Staff Headquarters and the Director-General of Education Department of the Army Ministry, the three major government agencies.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the new 12-year national defense plan submitted by the Army Ministry, the First Flight Corps Headquarters will be established in Gifu on August 1st, and the Second Flight Corps Headquarters will be established in Huining. At the same time, the Air Force Main Factory will be established, with several branch factories in key locations throughout the country. In addition, the Aviation Technical School will be established in Hamamatsu, and the Flying School will be established in Kumagaya. In addition, the internal structure of the Aviation Headquarters will be reformed to strengthen its organization. From August 1st of this year, the Army Ministry's official system will be greatly revised again. As a result, all aviation administrative affairs will be under the control of the Aviation Headquarters, and the command of the air force will be unified. (Allied News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>— Our Correspondents Hu Zhongchi and Hu Yizang</p>
<p>(6) From Kobe to Osaka</p>
<p>The next morning, a patrolman from the Hyogo Prefecture Police Station came to the hotel and questioned us at length. After he left, we hurriedly packed our luggage and went to the Marunouchi Station to take the Hanshin Electric Railway. Soon the train started. Looking out of the window, all we could see were factory chimneys like cannons pointing to the sky, and electric wires as dense as spider webs, contrasting with the bright distant mountain scenery on the horizon. On both sides of the track, various Japanese-style and Western-style houses stood side by side in villages. Many of the Japanese-style houses looked very elegant, with beautiful green gardens. This area is truly a region that Japan can boast about; we rarely saw dilapidated farmhouses.</p>
<p>It was already noon when we arrived at Osaka Station. This station is used by both electric trains and regular trains. Although it is still under expansion, the scale of its grandeur can be seen from the platform. After leaving the station, we followed a large crowd of pedestrians and crossed an extremely wide road full of electric trams, cars, and buses. We found a hotel on a narrower road in front of the station and settled our luggage. Then we strolled into a nearby restaurant and had a beef hot pot. After the meal, we called a "taxi" to go to the North Gang Public Association of the Chinese in Honden-cho. The number of "taxis" in Osaka is truly astonishing. On some roads, only empty cars could be seen driving in strings to solicit business. This modern means of transportation has gradually eliminated the rickshaw, which was invented in Japan itself. Now, there are reportedly only 300 rickshaws left in the entire city of Osaka, exclusively for curious Western tourists to ride.</p>
<p>The fare for "taxis" in Osaka is cheaper than in Kobe and Tokyo, with a minimum of thirty sen (Japanese currency). The front of the car is equipped with an automatic fare meter. After the thirty-sen mark, the meter jumps to forty sen. After that, every time a certain unit of distance is traveled, ten sen is added. Passengers do not need to ask for the price when calling a car. Our "taxi" from the station to the North Gang Public Association of the Chinese in Honden-cho cost only fifty sen.</p>
<p>The North Gang Public Association of the Chinese is a large Western-style building built with funds raised by the overseas Chinese of the North Gang, and it is annexed with our country's consulate office in Osaka. Osaka is the largest industrial city in East Asia, and various European and American countries have consulates there. However, it is a real pity that our country, which has the closest relationship with Japan, does not have a formal consulate in Osaka. Our government has long wanted to establish consulates in Japan, but partly because of the lack of funds for the consulates, and partly because obtaining the consent of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs would inevitably require exchange of conditions. Therefore, only a few consulate offices were added in important cities. Originally, the establishment of consulate offices does not require seeking the consent of the Japanese government. However, since our country has added several offices in Japan, the Japanese government wants to develop the power of Japanese residents in the North China area, and has also added many consulate branch offices in our country's non-treaty ports.</p>
<p>Our country's consulate office in Osaka is located downstairs in the North Gang Public Association of the Chinese, and a large room is the bill of lading certification office. In the consulate office opposite, we met Consul Ren Jiafeng. He is from Yixing and studied in Japan from a young age. He has been assigned to Osaka for more than three years. He talked to us like old friends for a long time, and also wrote us a letter of introduction to the mayor of Osaka. When we asked about the situation of the overseas Chinese in Osaka, he replied as follows:</p>
<p>"There are more than 2,200 overseas Chinese in Osaka, most of whom are traders, merchants, barbers, and cooks. The lives of the traders are naturally better, but their business conditions are also getting worse year by year. The rest of the overseas Chinese can only live a hard life. The overseas Chinese have a strong sense of their hometown, and the merchants are divided into two major gangs, north and south, each with its own public association. The North Gang Public Association has greater power, with about 300 member firms, and also has a school called Zhenhua Elementary School. This is the only school run by the overseas Chinese in Osaka. The organization jointly organized by the north and south gangs is called the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, which adopts a committee system with seven executive committee members. In addition, the overseas Chinese organizations in Osaka also include the Osaka Overseas Chinese Silk Industry Association, the Osaka Overseas Chinese Barbers Association, and the Osaka Overseas Chinese Catering Industry Association."</p>
<p>Back at the hotel, a plainclothes patrolman sent by the Osaka Police Station was waiting there. He asked about everything, and when he knew we were not spies, he said to us, "During this long trip, you certainly have manuscripts to send to your newspaper. When writing, please do not write about the bad aspects of our society, just write about the good aspects." We did not want him to pester us, so we replied casually, "We don't plan to live in your country for a long time, so it may not be easy to see the bad things in your bones. Besides, we are here to sightsee, of course we want to learn more about the good aspects."</p>

<p>Madrid The recent war in the vicinity is actually a war between labor and the army. Those loyal to the government have the upper hand today. Five thousand militiamen from the provinces of Murcia and Valencia arrived in the capital in time to replenish the vacancies of those killed and wounded in the past few days, and morale was greatly boosted. After the rebel army approaching the capital was defeated, the troops, shock troops, garrison troops, and militiamen loyal to the government formed three columns, and then began to prepare to attack the rebel army in Zaragoza (Reuters dispatch on the 25th).</p>
<p>Guadalajara, Northern Spain Special dispatch from our agency, the reinforcements sent by the government have already arrived in this mountainous area, and many planes have also been concentrated and are waiting for orders. General Legmi, the commander of the front line, has set up his headquarters in the local post office, and personally went to the front line to inspect this morning, preparing to order an attack. Outposts have already made contact. It is generally believed that the decisive battle between the government forces and the rebel army is imminent. It is said that the government forces have gained the upper hand in the battles in the southern mountains after bombarding them with light artillery (Havas dispatch on the 25th).</p>
<p>Barcelona Four columns of government troops composed of garrison troops, shock troops, militiamen, and regular troops, as well as many armored vehicles and transport vehicles, left here for the Chai Valley today. People also automatically flocked to the temporary recruitment office to sign up for the army. The Catalan autonomous government today allocated a temporary military expenditure of three million pesetas to help with military expenses. The city is very quiet today, factories are unanimously closed, the power supply is cut off, and there are many electric poles lying down (National Telegraph on the 24th).</p>
<p>Madrid The Ministry of Interior announced today a military victory, saying that the rebel army could be conquered in a few hours, and that it has been confirmed that the rebel army's military expenses were provided by the Spanish millionaire Maki. The government forces are now firmly defending the mountain passes of Guadalajara, Chamucilla, and Navacerrada. The defense of the capital is very strong. After 3,000 government troops and 3,000 militiamen fought fiercely with the rebel army in the mountains north of the capital, they defeated the rebel army. The government forces have advanced 15 miles towards Segovia. The outcome of the battle will soon be known (National Telegraph on the 24th).</p>
<p>Rebel Headquarters on the North Road of Burgos The leader of the rebel army on the North Road, Mala, announced here today the establishment of a new Republican government of Spain, saying that the current government has collapsed, and more than eight-tenths of Spain's land has fallen into our hands. Free Spain should immediately restore its status as a civilized country, and nominated Gabaleras as the new president. Since hearing that the defense of the capital is strong, the rebel army has now postponed the attack (National Telegraph on the 24th).</p>
<p>Madrid Official sources recently stated that the government now controls 22 of the 50 provinces in Spain. The rebel army in the southeast is still stubbornly resisting in the Zhenchira area. The government forces have gone from the two cities of Cartagena and Aligande to suppress them. The radio station in Cadiz Port in the west is still in the hands of the rebel army. Many government-owned aircraft have recently flown to bomb it. The situation of the battle in the Guadalajara mountain area north of Madrid can be decided today. The government forces have been fighting there for four days and are exhausted. Today, fresh troops will be transferred to reinforce them, and the strength of the main army will also be strengthened. As for the positions occupied by the government forces, they have been stabilized since they captured the Lion Ridge yesterday. All the officers and soldiers on the front line are now allowed to use postcards and pencils to write letters home. This is the first time since the chaos occurred, which shows that the front line is not very tense. All the civil corps in the capital and the groups belonging to the People's Front have moved into various public agencies to work yesterday. Other major hotels, such as the Casino Hotel, the Royal Palace Hotel, and the Ritz Hotel, and magnificent private residences have been converted into the headquarters or hospitals of these groups. In addition, the problem of the people's food is still tight. The mayor of this capital recently stated that he has taken various measures and decided to distribute rations to the families of the civil corps who are serving on the front lines every day, the total amount of which is equal to the food needed by 20,000 people (Havas dispatch on the 24th).</p>
<p>(Paris) This question received a telegram from the US Embassy in Spain today stating that the government forces are fighting fiercely with the rebel army north of Madrid. The outcome is unknown. Foreign nationals in Madrid are gradually feeling uneasy (National Telegraph on the 24th).</p>

Currently, there are still 8,500 members of the militia who have been formed into three columns and will serve on the front lines very soon. The first column, consisting of 3,000 members, gathered in Catalonia Square this afternoon to prepare to depart. All the strong men who joined the army said goodbye to their families, and some young lovers came to see them off, whispering sweet words and being reluctant to part. The square suddenly presented a wartime scene. The second column, consisting of 2,000 members, gathered in the Tarragona area, mostly composed of a mixed force of security team infantry, gendarmes, and militiamen belonging to the People's Front. They have already left for the city of Zaragoza. The third column, consisting of 2,500 members, and another 1,000 members of the anti-fascist militia, are also preparing to depart.

According to the pilots, they saw in the sky that the city of Yega had been captured by the government army (Havas dispatch on the 24th).</p>
<p>Hendaye, France The great chaos in Spain for days has caused the number of losses in life and property to increase daily, and the government army and the rebel party are still in a state of uncertainty as to who will win. Fierce fighting broke out in the Entellaza mountain pass today, and it continued all day long. The sound of artillery was heard here, and it could be clearly distinguished. Our agency's interviewer recently learned that there was no winner in this battle. The government army and the rebel army are still holding their original positions. This afternoon, several Spanish refugees fled to the village of Biarritz in France, with frightened faces and in a very miserable state. According to them, the battle was very fierce, and the number of gendarmes killed on the government army side was very large. At 5:00 in the afternoon, another group of refugees crossed the Bidasoa River and asked the French authorities to allow them to bring their livestock into the country. Another three gendarmes fled into French territory, claiming that when the rebel army came to attack, they were in the Entellaza mountain pass. After the battle, they were captured and taken to the Behobia area. After being briefly interrogated by the rebel army, they were ordered to be executed. Fortunately, they escaped and fled into France. In addition, according to news from San Sebastian, the station there was not burned down. The remaining rebel party fled into the Daria Hotel. The government army immediately surrounded it. For a time, the sound of gunfire was very dense around the hotel. Finally, the government army attacked the hotel and saw 27 members of the rebel party. All had committed suicide and were lying dead on the ground, knowing that they were no match and would rather shoot themselves than surrender. It is also heard that Salamanca and the port of Bilbao are currently still in the hands of the government army, and the local area is as peaceful as usual (Havas dispatch on the 24th).</p>
<p>Burgos General Mala, the commander-in-chief of the rebel army on the North Road, led 60,000 regular troops and volunteers and occupied the main road to Madrid today. As soon as the army on the South Road succeeds, it will attack the capital. Its advance team is searching for left-wing elements in the countryside. General Mala declared that several detachments of his troops are less than 40 miles from Madrid and are waiting for orders to attack, hoping that there will be no major bloodshed when the capital is occupied (National Telegraph on the 24th).</p>
<p>Rebel Headquarters in Tétouan, Morocco The leader of the Spanish rebel army, Franco, told the United Press reporter today that he is fighting according to the planned plan and is convinced that the revolutionary army will be able to achieve the final victory. The purpose of the revolution is to eliminate the power of Moscow. The revolutionary army has not encountered any difficulties so far, but the attitude of the navy has surprised him, saying that if the navy could be supplied with arms and food earlier, the navy could also join the revolution (National Telegraph on the 24th).</p>
<h3 id="e28">Prospects for the Five-Power Conference Britain Expresses Optimism Italy and Germany Have Not Yet Officially Replied <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden met with the German and Italian representatives this afternoon and informed them of the Locarno Conference held by the representatives of Britain, France, and Italy in London yesterday. The diplomatic representatives of the three countries in Germany and Italy also notified the governments of the two countries of the results of the three-nation conference and sent a letter of invitation for the five-nation conference this morning. Berlin issued a communique stating that Foreign Minister Neurath is not currently at the ministry, so the director of the political department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with the representatives of the three countries. It was not convenient to give an immediate reply at the time, only saying that they were willing to accept the document with interest and sympathy. It is also learned here that Germany and Italy are very satisfied with the acceptance of the three-nation proposal. The European situation has been deteriorating in recent years, and there is now hope for a turning point. Countries can now cooperate again to seek a general and lasting solution. In addition, according to a commentary by a diplomatic interviewer from a major British newspaper on the three-nation conference, yesterday can be called the anniversary of the turbulent Europe moving towards a new path to a solution. The newspapers here were moved and praised for the speed and consistency with which the three countries fulfilled the British government's real purpose. The location and date of the future five-nation conference will be resolved by the five countries through diplomatic channels (Reuters dispatch on the 24th).</p>
<p>(Berlin) Newspapers generally take a reserved attitude towards the communique issued by the representatives of Britain, France, and Belgium in London on the 23rd, but express hope, saying that if a peaceful construction plan is sought to be easily realized, then the future five-nation conference should only be attended by Western European countries. The Frankfurter Zeitung also issued an optimistic tone, "The achievements of this London talk are at least better than the first Locarno Conference on March 19. Since Germany abolished the Locarno Pact on March 7, after all parties were indignant, they have made various harsh demands. Up to this point, these harsh demands have been covered up by subsequent events and no longer maintain their original appearance. It is a pity that the three-nation communique still implicitly mentions "the situation caused by Germany's actions on March 7." This remnant of thought must be eradicated, and then the new Locarno Pact will be easier to establish." (Havas dispatch on the 25th).</p>
<p>(Rome) Italy has recently received invitations from Britain, France, and Belgium to participate in the future five-nation conference. Political figures here stated that Italy must wait a few days before replying. Informed sources said, "Once the conditions that Italy considers indispensable are put into practice, Italy will gladly re-enter into cooperation on European events." According to reports, Italy previously refused to participate in the Montreux Conference on the pretext that the Mediterranean Mutual Assistance Agreement had not yet been abolished. The so-called indispensable conditions here probably refer to this (Havas dispatch on the 24th).</p>
<p>(London) After the representatives of Britain, France, and Belgium held talks here on the 23rd, they immediately issued a communique. The German and Italian sides have commented on it. After hearing the news, the newspapers here still expressed optimism, but believed that before the construction of true peace in Europe could begin, there were still hidden difficulties that needed to be overcome urgently. The diplomatic reporter of the Manchester Guardian recently published a commentary, "It is natural for Germany and Italy to still have doubts about this communique. However, the hostile attitude expressed by each country is not as severe as generally expected. As for the last paragraph of this communique, which advocates that in addition to the five countries, other countries should also be able to participate in future conferences, Germany believes that there is still room for discussion, because this statement is equivalent to inviting Soviet Russia to participate in the conference."

<h3 id="e29">The Future of the Hirota Cabinet (6) <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— Jia He</p>
<p>Currently, the direct confrontation between the military and Hirota is not about any other issue, but about the expansion of the Investigation Bureau's authority, the establishment of a minister without portfolio as a result, and the reform of the administrative structure. When the Cabinet Deliberation Council was abolished, many people thought this was a precursor to the Investigation Bureau's elevation, but that is not the case. The existence of the Cabinet Deliberation Council was to strengthen the cabinet's function because the Seiyukai, the leading party at the time, adopted an opposition stance. The Hirota Cabinet, having obtained the support of political parties (albeit to a limited extent), naturally did not need such an organ. Moreover, after the loss of the two elders, Takahashi Korekiyo and Saito Makoto, it was impossible to find the same kind of people to fill the gap. Therefore, it was abolished with pleasure, which is not enough to be evidence for Yoshida Shigeru and others to celebrate. In fact, the Investigation Bureau, which the military hopes will have the power to initiate proposals and the power to budget, becoming a small cabinet within the cabinet, is still unknown. (The "Tokyo Asahi Shimbun" of March 20th still carried news of cabinet members opposing the strengthening of the Cabinet Investigation Bureau). Another message came that a minister without portfolio could be established according to the military's wishes, but this minister would not be at the beck and call of Yoshida Shigeru, the chief of the Miyakezaka district, but rather Prince Fumimaro Konoe, the president of the House of Peers (June 23rd "Chugai Shogyo Shimpo"); currently, all newspapers are frowning upon this matter, as if they cannot find the right person, then the establishment of a minister without portfolio will be difficult to pass in the cabinet meeting. By June 29th, the opposition between the Cabinet Investigation Bureau and the cabinet ministers became more obvious. This is because the former submitted to the cabinet meeting a plan to reform the administrative structure decided by all the councilors – namely, abolishing the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, merging the Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry, Commerce and Industry into the Ministry of Industry, merging Railways and Communications into the Ministry of Transport, and expanding the Bureau of Health into the Ministry of Health, reducing the original twelve ministries to ten – and the national policy proposal put forward by the three chiefs was also rejected by the cabinet members. Some cabinet members were unwilling to treat the proposal of all the councilors of the Investigation Bureau as a proposal, only allowing it to be kept for reference, ignoring Yoshida Shigeru's opposition. (June 30th "Chugai Shogyo Shimpo").</p>
<p>Cutting off the connection between the military and the young officers is something the young military officers could not tolerate. Their only hope is to elevate the Investigation Bureau. If that becomes a bubble, doesn't that mean throwing the military out of the political circle? The military only participates in politics in the cabinet meetings and can never win because it only occupies two seats. If the Investigation Bureau has expanded powers, with Yoshida Shigeru, the minister without portfolio and chief, at the top, and young officers and military-sent councilors at the bottom, it will naturally be able to achieve effective control. Now, the Hirota Cabinet not only does not satisfy their desires but wants them to retreat, which is absolutely unacceptable to the military. Therefore, at the end of June, General Terauchi "advised" Hirota, saying that there were too many "national policies" ("national policy overflow" was satirized by the press), and strongly supported Raimoki's "National Power Control Plan." As a result of being pressured by this "advice," Hirota broke his own rules and allowed the three chiefs to attend the cabinet meeting on July 3rd. Although the issue of administrative structure reform was not yet discussed, Raimoki's proposal was enough to cause a major dispute. Originally, Japan, due to its geographical location and lack of fuel resources, had a particularly developed electricity industry. Currently, all electricity is controlled by the five major electricity cartels: Tokyo Electric Power, Toho Electric Power, Daido Electric Power, Japan Electric Power, and Ujikawa Electric Power, intricately linked to the funds of the Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda zaibatsu. Due to the division of monopoly profits, major political tides often occur. The changes of cabinets during the Taisho era and the early Showa era were closely related to this. Later, in order to prevent mutual struggles from harming the rights of the zaibatsu, the relevant zaibatsu promoted their cooperation, and the "Electricity League Rules" came into being. This temporary truce did not eliminate internal disputes: Wako Shohachi of the Koshu-based zaibatsu, belonging to Tokyo Electric Power (a major figure in the Seiyukai), has always advocated "nationalization of electricity"; President Hayashi of Uji insists on "nationalization of power generation" and "privatization of power sales"; Koayashi Ichizo of the Mitsui zaibatsu uses the power of Tokyo to control the entire Japanese electricity industry, demanding the "merger of the five major electric power companies." These claims, backed by the respective zaibatsu, are still lurking in the minds of the heads of each electricity cartel. Now, due to the military's demands (which are quite beneficial to industrialists), they are accepting Yoshida Shigeru's nationalization proposal, which stipulates that ownership is held by investors and operating rights belong to the government, which is actually depriving the zaibatsu of their monopoly profits. Even the executives of the Minseito (which has close ties to Toho Electric Power) have taken an opposing stance, and other voices of opposition are spreading throughout the country. We do not know what Raimoki is thinking, who has always been subsidized by Showa Electric Power (a subsidiary of Daido Electric Power). Currently, if Yoshida Shigeru's original plan is implemented without modification, it will obviously be harmful and not beneficial to the major zaibatsu. According to the instructions of past history, this will become a major cause of future political tides. If Hirota does not handle it properly, due to the discord among the cabinet members (there were already differences of opinion among the ministers at the cabinet meeting on July 3rd), the anger of the zaibatsu, the future of the cabinet is not optimistic.</p>

<p>Marseilles Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British government's economic advisor, who was dispatched to China for nearly a year, recently returned to the country, passing through here, and issued a statement saying that if the situation in the northern provinces of China can be resolved, and domestic peace can be maintained for a long time, then the country's finances can reach a good state. The Chinese government has made many efforts to revive its financial economy. At present, if foreign private sectors can actively invest to support the development of various enterprises, then the revitalization work will naturally see more rapid progress. He also said that the current urgent task is to reform the tariff system: (1) to reduce tax rates; (2) to curb smuggling. Regarding the second item, the Chinese government has already implemented strict punishment measures to promote its progress. Those who violate the law in the most serious circumstances will even be sentenced to death. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>Gibraltar General Kindelan, the air force commander of the Spanish rebels, is an assistant to the rebel leader General Franco. He recently telegraphed the foreign ministers of Italy and Germany, asking them to forward a request to the British government to stop the Spanish government fleet from operating near the port of Gibraltar, so as not to endanger the port of Gibraltar when our army's aircraft conduct bombing. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Madrid The government recently broadcast a radio message saying that the money used by the rebels was supplied by financier March. March is a famous Spanish banker. When General Sanjurjo, the leader of the restoration party, started an incident in 1932, he secretly provided funds and was sentenced to imprisonment. He then found a way to escape and lived abroad. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Marseilles The Spanish ship Tarragona and torpedo ship No. 17 have recently arrived in this port, reportedly with secret missions. The Spanish consul in Marseilles met with the captains of each ship, but refused to make a statement. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Barcelona The French cruiser Duguay-Trouin arrived in this city today. Admiral Soustel also arrived on the ship and immediately went ashore to visit Mr. Companys, the president of Catalonia. The French Citroen car factory also sent a telegram to Mr. Companys, expressing its congratulations on the province's victory over the fascist rebels. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the French government's plan to supply arms to the Spanish Republican government, although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has denied it, the right-wing newspapers here are still criticizing the People's Front government for not supplying arms to the Spanish People's Front government. Among them, "Le Journal" reported that "The Spanish government has purchased aircraft from France, the first batch totaling four, and the transaction has been completed. The country's chargé d'affaires, Castillo, has resigned because he refused to sign the check. The military attaché of the country's embassy, Mr. Barroso, and the consuls-general stationed in Marseilles and Bayonne have also resigned for the same reason. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Spanish civil war has caused repercussions internationally. The French right-wing newspapers are still continuing to attack the People's Front government for not supplying arms, aircraft, aircraft grenade launchers, field guns, and other military supplies to the Spanish People's Front government. Their rhetoric is becoming increasingly blatant. "Le Peuple", the organ of the orthodox Socialist Party, also published a message from Antwerp, Belgium, stating that General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Spanish rebels, had purchased 24 aircraft from Italy. "The Italian government is eager to assist the Spanish right-wingers and establish a fascist system, thereby profiting from it and establishing hegemony in the Mediterranean." (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the French government's plan to supply arms and aircraft to the Spanish Republican government, "L'Intransigeant" reported that France and Spain have been in talks on the issue of purchasing arms, but deliveries have not yet begun. Aviation Minister Cot stated to the Spanish representative that France can supply 25 fighter planes, 25 reconnaissance planes, and light bombers. In addition, the Spanish government also requested the supply of 20,000 aircraft bombs, 50 machine guns, 8 75mm field guns, and 13 million rounds of ammunition. According to a message from the port of Bordeaux, the airmail plane that flew from Madrid to Paris a few days ago carried ten Spanish air force personnel. After landing at the port, it continued to fly to the capital. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Castillo, the Spanish chargé d'affaires in France, has resigned due to the country's government purchasing arms from France, and made a statement to the press, stating, "Regarding my resignation, the reports in various newspapers are inconsistent. I really have to issue a brief statement to clarify the truth. Since taking office, I have been deeply grateful for the preferential treatment I have received from the French government. I have always served the republican government of my country, including the current government, with loyalty. Now, driven by my conscience, I am unwilling to purchase foreign arms to kill my compatriots, so I have to resign. I don't want to say more than that." Afterwards, the Spanish embassy issued a statement firmly denying what Castillo said, and said that Castillo's false statements were a violation of diplomatic customs. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The cabinet is scheduled to hold an extraordinary cabinet meeting at the presidential palace this afternoon. According to political figures, Prime Minister Léon Blum, Minister of War Daladier, and Foreign Minister Delbos decided to convene a cabinet meeting this morning after a meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This move is related to the Spanish situation. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian recently commented on the Spanish situation, stating that the arms used by the rebels in the country, especially the rebels in Morocco, mostly came from Italy. In addition, German power is very strong in the Balearic Islands of Spain in the Mediterranean. If the rebels succeed in this Spanish rebellion, Germany can obtain the concession of the Balearic Islands. Therefore, the victory of the rebels is considered beneficial by Germany. Not only that, but if the rebels succeed, the situation will take on a new look, making it easier for Germany to operate in Western Europe. Germany already has many National Socialist Party branches in Spain, and its organization is very complete. In recent weeks, Germans have often gone to the country to strengthen its power. At the same time, German personnel are secretly deployed in the area, using the name of diplomacy and education as a cover for political or military espionage, and their organization is also very powerful. As for Morocco, it is most concerned by Germany. If the rebels win, Germany can not only obtain territorial concessions there, but also gain a foothold in North Africa. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) Although the Spanish government claims that Madrid is no longer in danger of being occupied by the rebels, according to the contradictory news received here today, the truth about the Spanish capital is confusing. Although railway and highway traffic in the area has been disrupted, there is no shortage of food for the people. Many British women and children in Madrid have been provided with food and accommodation by the British Embassy, which has also requested the Spanish government authorities to provide full protection for British nationals. The situation in Barcelona is still quite tense, but according to news received today, the local authorities have brought to justice those who have committed arson. It is reported that these villains mostly live in the city's major hotels and clubs. The British warship stationed in Barcelona has taken most of the British women and children and several American nationals aboard. However, most British women have decided to stay on shore with their husbands. Although food prices have risen sharply, they can still be purchased. A few newspapers also resumed publication for the first time yesterday. Two British destroyers that arrived in San Sebastian yesterday have left the country with more than 300 nationals. Another British destroyer has set sail for La Manga to transport another group of British nationals. Several British and American nationals in Tarragona were evacuated yesterday on a British destroyer. The remaining British warships are actively transporting nationals at various ports. There have been few injuries to foreigners during this disturbance. The only major incident is that the wife of the Norwegian consul in San Sebastian was seriously injured by a gunshot while looking out the window. In addition, a British student was also injured in San Sebastian. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) State Department officials said today that the U.S. Ambassador to Spain, Bowers, reported by telephone at 10:30 this morning that he is now vacationing in a villa five miles outside of San Sebastian and is safe and sound. The U.S. mail ship Oklahoma and the Coast Guard cutter Cayuga have arrived in San Sebastian.

The U.S. Consul in Tangier has protested to rebel leader Darranco. Johnson, the counselor of the U.S. Embassy in Spain, reported by telephone that 15 American nationals have left San Sebastian today. The remaining American nationals have decided to stay in the capital temporarily because the street fighting has stopped. (National Electric, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) Staff members of the British, French, and German embassies in Spain have recently gone to San Sebastian for vacation. Now that a riot has occurred in the area, the safety of these individuals is unknown, and people are very worried about them. Warships are now rushing to the area and other three towns to rescue foreigners. Two British destroyers have rescued many British nationals from San Sebastian. In addition, two German pocket battleships are rushing to Barcelona, where there are 6,000 German nationals. The British destroyer HMS Intrepid, carrying British nationals from San Sebastian, has arrived in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, France. Another three British destroyers, carrying 150 British nationals from Barcelona, have arrived in Marseilles. Another destroyer, carrying more than 100 people, is expected to arrive at a French port within days. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The government has decided to dispatch a pocket-sized cruiser to protect German nationals. Political figures recently stated that there are as many as 15,000 German nationals in Spain. It is only reasonable for the government to send a warship to protect them. This move also has important significance, that is, it can prove that Germany is a strong country and should act in concert with the major powers. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) The governments of Italy and Germany have both sent warships to Spain to protect their nationals. Upon hearing the news, political figures here have expressed great concern about the situation in Spain and fear that the arrival of Italian and German warships in the rebel areas of Spain will cause serious accidents and have an impact internationally. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Navy Minister Gasnier issued a statement to the newspapers tonight, saying that the French destroyer L'Indomptable had carried 300 French and other nationals at 5 pm this afternoon from the port of San Sebastian in Spain back to Saint-Jean-de-Luz, France. For those foreigners who did not have time to leave on this ship, another gunboat will be sent to transport them tomorrow. Also, two British destroyers have arrived at the port to carry their nationals out of the country. The Navy Department has ordered the cruiser Duguay-Trouin to light its fires and stand ready to depart. It is generally known that the Duguay-Trouin will sail to the port of Barcelona in Spain to protect the lives of French nationals. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to official sources, the Italian cruisers Fiume and Montecuccoli, the hospital ship "De Weile", and the mail ship Princess Maria have now arrived in the port of Barcelona in Spain and will soon transport nationals back to the country.

<h3 id="e35">British Scientific Luminary Sir Henry Wellcome Passes Away <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(London) Sir Henry Wellcome, the renowned British scientist, archaeologist, ethnologist, and author, passed away today due to illness. Wellcome was the current chairman of the Wellcome Trust Board of Trustees and the founder and director of the Wellcome Research Institute, the Historical Medical Museum, and the Scientific Research Bureau. In 1913, Wellcome made the Scientific Research Institute available to the government. In 1914, he established a special committee to study and improve the design and construction of military ambulances. In the same year, he created a mobile chemical microbial experiment vehicle for use by the British Army Medical Corps on the battlefield. During the last World War, it proved practical and effective in both Palestine and Egypt. In 1901, Wellcome personally went to the upper reaches of the Nile River in British Egypt and Sudan for archaeological and ethnological exploration. He revisited the area in 1910 to continue his unfinished work. Wellcome also discovered the previously unknown ancient city ruins of the Upper Egyptians in several places. He then implemented excavation and research work in four of these locations, which was temporarily suspended due to the outbreak of the war. He was also a pioneer in aerial photography, using it as a tool to explore and measure various ancient city ruins and record excavation sites. In 1927, he established the Lady Stanley Maternity Hospital in Uganda, Central Africa. In 1905, he founded the Wellcome Hospital Pharmacy, both managed by church medical officers. Wellcome also established a publishing fund, managed by the Chinese Medical Association, to provide standard textbooks of medicine, surgery, and chemistry, translated into Chinese at low prices, making them easily accessible to Chinese students. Wellcome was also the vice-president of the Anthropological Institute, the vice-chairman of the Fine Arts Society, and a member of many other societies. (Reuters, 25th)</p>

<p>Three, Misunderstanding the Nature and Application of Learning</p>
<p>A middle school student won first prize in a civic knowledge test competition. He knew very clearly about the ideal responsibilities of a citizen. Everyone thought he was a good citizen. But a few months later, he was arrested by the police for doing something that harmed public order. Common criticism was that the student did not truly understand the responsibilities of a citizen. His words were empty. Closer examination reveals that the problem is not so simple. Historically, schools have only focused on intellectual understanding, assuming that it can encompass all of life, and have particularly neglected appreciative and emotional responses. Taking the above example, the school only provided intellectual learning and understanding responses, assuming that it could control emotional and moral environments. In reality, learning responses of this kind should emphasize emotions or appreciation, and attitudes and actions. Therefore, it is not only necessary to know what constitutes true learning, but also to know what kind of learning response is required in what situations in life. Matters without emotional influence can be controlled by intellectual learning, but in situations requiring action, mere intellectual responses are of no use.</p>
<p>Misunderstanding the nature and application of learning also has another negative impact. For example, English requires at least four teaching methods: grammar uses scientific methods, literature must use appreciative methods, composition is a literary art, and spelling requires the principle of practice. The difference between grammar and literature is like the difference between algebra and sports. Therefore, someone who teaches grammar well may not teach literature well. But now it is all called English, and the teaching methods are not differentiated, so how can it be good?</p>
<p>In addition to the above three misunderstandings, there is another major flaw in teaching, which is teaching too much and learning too little. Students in the classroom only listen to the teacher's explanations and rarely engage in activities themselves. In the future, efforts should be made to integrate teaching and learning, and a portion of teaching time should be extracted in each subject to guide students in self-study. It should be known that the efficiency of teaching depends not on the amount of teaching time, but on the proper use of time.</p>
<p>The most difficult issue to handle in secondary school education is moral education, but it is also the most important. The quality of a school's discipline affects the entire administration, and the quality of a student's character affects their entire life. Therefore, all countries attach great importance to moral education. Recently, the discipline of secondary schools in our country has improved compared to the past. However, the spirit of students being lazy, perfunctory, undisciplined, and decadent still exists. The reason for this is that schools in the past had mistaken views on moral education. In the past, schools treated teaching as one thing and moral education as another. Therefore, teachers only knew how to teach in class and did not care about students' behavior or thoughts. Students only knew how to study at school and regarded physical training and emotional cultivation as secondary matters. The accumulation of frost leads to hard ice - this situation has been long-standing!</p>
<p>Speaking of the academic atmosphere, we all admire the "public schools" in England. The reason why their academic atmosphere is good is because teaching and moral education are not separated. Whether in teaching, sports, or other aspects of life, the entire student is trained. Therefore, the relationship between teachers and students is harmonious. There is not a student who does not love their teachers and their school. German secondary schools have always been constrained, rigid, and focused on intellectualism, but since the rise of the youth movement, the national spirit and attitude have changed. The main aim of the youth movement is to break free from the constraints of the city and engage more with nature. Those who participated in the movement advocated organizing small groups, living a life of roaming and picnicking, in order to cultivate young people's independent ability, strong bodies, and establish group discipline and a spirit of mutual assistance. Their unanimous slogan is to love the motherland, love the people, and love the local customs and traditions. This movement not only brought about major changes in the minds and bodies of young people but also influenced educational principles and implementation. According to their view, knowledge is the foundation of culture, not the purpose of culture. Culture represents activity, will, creativity, and a balanced and harmonious personality. Therefore, the goal of education should not be to obtain knowledge as the only skill, but to develop all aspects of the individual: body, will, and emotions. The efficiency of education should not be tested by the standard of repeating teaching materials, but by whether students have the interest and ability to discover the truth of things.</p>
<p>From the above two examples, the trend of Chinese secondary schools is not to focus on the inculcation of knowledge, but on the cultivation of the whole personality. Although we are currently advocating the integration of teaching and moral education, there are some changes in the system and personnel, but in spirit, there is still separation. The main reason for the separation is that teachers in general cannot deeply understand the importance of the integration of teaching and moral education. Therefore, the emotions between teachers and students are distant, and the efficiency of education is minimal. Future education must integrate teaching and moral education, and regard the entire youth as the object of training, and regard serving society and dedicating oneself to the country as the goal of training.</p>
<p>The nation is in such a serious crisis that we do not want secondary schools to cultivate a group of young people who are self-serving and study dead books. We hope that every young person, after receiving secondary education, will have a strong physique and know about sexual hygiene; read books and understand principles, have rich common sense, applied skills, and be able to use their minds to study profound academic principles at any time; be strong-willed, not afraid of danger, have clear responsibilities, not be stubborn, obey the orders of the group, and abide by public discipline. Every young person has the spirit of reforming society and the determination to revive the nation. We know that the great problem of China lies not in its powerful neighbors, but in the lack of transformation of people's hearts and the lack of unity among the people. If these two problems are not corrected, even if we are fortunate enough to win a battle, the country will still face repeated crises. If people's hearts are gradually transformed and the people are gradually united, even if we succumb for a time, there will eventually be a day of revival. The responsibility of transforming people's hearts and uniting the people must be borne by young people who have received secondary education. Young people who have received secondary education must start with themselves in order to be able to shoulder this heavy responsibility.</p>

He also said that if the leftist government continues to cling to power, this revolution will never end. He deeply hopes that Spain will break free from terror and killings as soon as possible. Only the failure of the leftist government can end the civil war and bring peace to Spain. This revolution is purely a national movement, that is, the positive action of the Royalists and right-wing Republicans to overthrow the leftist government. (National Telegraph, 24th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Smuggled goods going south from Tianjin have not been transported for five days. The No. 305 train south on the Jinpu Railway has resumed normal order every night, and passenger traffic remains constant. Since the forced loading and transportation of smuggled goods by train, the Jinpu Railway's passenger transport losses have averaged 1,500 yuan per day, and freight losses have exceeded 4,000 yuan, totaling around 400,000 yuan. Tianjin Customs officers will now resume responsibility for anti-smuggling matters, proceeding according to ministry orders, and will no longer relax. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese nationals have stored a total of 300,000 bags of sugar in Tianjin. Only 15,000 bags have been shipped south this month so far, compared to the past average monthly sales of 56,000 bags. According to sales, it will take half a year to clear the stock. Recently, due to strict customs anti-smuggling efforts, the Japanese are losing more than 100,000 yuan per week. The price of a bag of sugar has fallen from 15.7 yuan to 14.5 yuan. Currently, Dalian has 400,000 bags of sugar in stock, and they are still worried about finding a market. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Jinling Customs has successively seized a large number of smuggled goods such as sugar and rayon. After separate auctions, no tax-evading goods have been found recently. All anti-smuggling personnel have nothing to do and are now transferred to the northern section of Jinpu to continue working in various anti-smuggling sub-offices. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the central government promulgated the regulations on punishing the leakage of customs duties, the Jinpu Railway has strengthened its assistance to the customs in anti-smuggling efforts, making it even stricter. A large number of smuggled goods smuggled on various passenger cars on the railway, from late May to the end of June this year, various passenger cars forcibly loaded more than 10,000 pieces of smuggled goods without tickets at Tianjin East Station, with rayon, sugar, cigarette paper, and cloth being the main items. The average freight cost of these smuggled goods, based on reaching Jinan, has not been less than 30,000 yuan. In addition, the third-class carriages of passenger cars are filled with smuggled goods, and passengers boarding the train are often squeezed off the train and demand a refund. This loss averages 8,000 yuan per day. In addition, the sugar car in Jinan was robbed, resulting in a loss of more than 8,000 yuan. In recent days, due to the abundance of smuggled goods, legitimate goods of the same type transported north from Pukou have almost disappeared. In addition, due to overloading, vehicles are damaged, and windows and other items are destroyed. It is reported that the railway has suffered direct and indirect losses of more than 350,000 yuan in the past month. (Central News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Based on a tip-off, the customs stationed in Xuzhou and the Public Security Bureau discovered that the Fuyi Sugar Warehouse in Nanguan was smuggling 168 bags of white sugar. They had no tax documents and refused to report. On the 24th, the two agencies jointly sealed it up, and on the 25th, they handed it over to the Jinpu Railway to allocate a car to transport it to Shanghai for customs to handle.

<p>(Tianjin) Lu Longzhi, the manager of Hengyuan and Beiyang Cotton Mills, said that since Chengxin Trust Company has been operating the two cotton mills, Hengyuan has invested more than 700,000 yuan, and Beiyang will also invest 600,000 to 700,000 yuan due to the expansion of its business. Currently, the two mills' operations are still sufficient to maintain. The news of Japanese investment and sale is absolutely inaccurate. Previously, the spread of this news shocked the cotton industry in the north and south, and many people came to inquire. So far, there has been no conclusion to the reply. The cotton industry in North China is not unfeasible. Labor is cheap, fundraising is easy, and it is convenient to obtain raw materials. Sales can be entirely in the domestic market, which is incomparable to the Japanese cotton industry, which obtains raw materials from others and also needs to expand sales abroad. Past failures of the industry are due to their own lack of effort. At the moment, the fear of being oppressed is close to being a self-inflicted worry. Although the Huaxin and Baocheng mills have been sold, it cannot be determined who the buyer is. If the shareholders of the two mills are determined to take the lead, and if industrialists are willing to help, the future is still bright. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e69">Jiangxi Province: Yumin Bank Embezzlement Case: Deputy Director and Others Embezzle Huge Sums; Responsible Parties Arrested After Discovery <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang correspondence: A major embezzlement case has recently been discovered at the Jiangxi Provincial Yumin Bank, causing a stir throughout the entire province. The Jiangxi Yumin Bank originally had a capital stock of one million yuan, which was later handled by Director of the Provincial Department of Finance Wu Jiantao, responsible for establishing it as a provincial financial center. Wu immediately expanded the bank's official shares to two million yuan, appointing Liao Xinren as the bank director and Qian Yuqi, from the money industry, as the deputy director. It issued one-dime, two-dime, and five-dime auxiliary coins totaling one million yuan, with branch offices and agencies established throughout various counties and cities, serving as agents for the provincial treasury and sub-treasuries for grain collection and tax collection in various counties. The business grew daily. However, Qian, at this time, openly pursued private gain. Last year, he colluded with Wu Meisun, the branch manager of the Shanghai Yumin Bank, to embezzle bank funds and repeatedly engage in speculative transactions such as buying and selling government bonds, resulting in losses of hundreds of thousands of yuan. At the same time, Qian's Yishengheng Money Exchange, with a capital stock of tens of thousands of yuan, presented a facade of hundreds of thousands of yuan, relying on the Yumin Bank as its backing. As a result, the outside world criticized the Yumin Bank. Director Wu also felt uneasy. Later, Director Wu was transferred to Guangdong, and Secretary-General Liu took over the Department of Finance. Chen Wei took over the Yumin Bank and, after thoroughly investigating, understood the details of the embezzlement. The bank secretly reported to Provincial Chairman Xiong Shihui, who telegraphed Wu Meisun to come to the province from Shanghai, and arrested both he and Qian Yuqi, handing them over to the local court for trial. Qian's Yishengheng Money Exchange has also been sealed, and all account books have been submitted to the local court for review. It is rumored that the amount embezzled by Wu and Qian from the bank is approximately several hundred thousand, approaching one million yuan. However, authorities are currently secretly investigating the true situation in order to severely punish them in the future. (July 22)</p>
<h3 id="e70">Situation in North China: The Situation in the Midst of Dullness: Zhang Zizhong Arrives in Beiping to Report on the Tianjin Incident; Cao Rulin and Tang Erhe Still Express Intention to Resign; Japanese Side Eagerly Hopes for Realization of Economic Cooperation; In Chahar, Prince De Forced to Form Eight Divisions <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Beiping correspondence: In the past week, Beiping has entered the hot season, although there have been two heavy rains, the heat has not diminished, only the mornings and evenings are relatively cool. Due to the heat, various military and government agencies have changed their office hours to operate from 7:00 AM to 12:00 PM. In the afternoon, personnel from various agencies seek medicine to alleviate the heat. Regarding the diplomatic corps, ambassadors, ministers, or chargés d'affaires have begun to go to Beidaihe for summer, so the situation seems rather dull for a time. However, amidst this dullness, Qi Xieyuan suddenly came to Beiping, and Shi Yousan took the post of political commissioner, which is noteworthy. Furthermore, regarding Tianjin, during this dullness, the Tianjin Security Team shot and killed Zhang Delu, a special agent of the Japanese police station. Afterward, on the 23rd, the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin made demands to the Tianjin municipal government for apology, compensation, punishment of the perpetrator, and guarantees, which were accepted. It is heard that the Japanese side requested 30,000 yuan in compensation, and the perpetrator and instigator, Zou Fengling, was handed over by the Japanese police station to the Tianjin Public Security Bureau for punishment on the 24th. Tianjin Mayor Zhang Zizhong, on the evening of the 24th, came to Beiping from Tianjin to meet with Song Zheyuan to report on the resolution of the incident. According to Zhang, "The demands made by the Japanese side after this incident were still reasonable, and our side also conducted negotiations based on reason, and fortunately, a satisfactory resolution was reached. I have come to report the process to Chairman Song. My feelings about this matter are that although the occurrence of this incident was unfortunate, it can prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future. I will return to Tianjin in two or three days in Beiping."</p>
<p>Regarding the situation of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, in terms of personnel, in addition to the change of the chief of political affairs and the assignment of Pan Yugui to prepare for the Cangzhou-Shijiazhuang Railway project, four new members, Cao Rulin, Tang Erhe, Liu Ruming, and Ge Dingyuan, were added. Cao and Tang have expressed their intention not to assume their positions in Tianjin and Beiping. On the 24th, the committee held its 12th regular meeting, which Cao and Tang did not attend, while Liu and Ge were present as observers. Pan also expressed his intention to resign from the Cangzhou-Shijiazhuang Railway project, but Song Zheyuan immediately retained him and, during the 12th regular meeting, temporarily proposed that the Transportation and Economic Committees properly draft measures for constructing the Cangzhou-Shijiazhuang Railway, which was passed. The two committees are preparing to start drafting jointly. As for the coming of Qi and Shi to Beiping, in addition to discussing matters that should be noted at present, the issue of the re-emergence of a certain important figure was also discussed, but it is understood that now is not the time.</p>
<p>The issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is most concerned by the Japanese side, and they are eager to see it realized. Wang Kemin previously came to Beiping and had contact with various parties concerned, but they were all general discussions of opinions, and no concrete aspects were discussed. When Wang left Beiping, he said that he planned to return to Beijing by the end of the month, but according to what is known here, Wang may not be able to come north as scheduled, and the twists and turns are not easily known to outsiders. The general situation of the situation is still not stable.</p>
<p>Regarding northern Chahar, everything remains the same. It is rumored that Prince De has been forced to form eight divisions and is currently recruiting new soldiers. Three divisions have already been established. These three divisions are under the command of the traitor Li Shouxin, and the candidates for the division commanders of the eight divisions are also said to have been appointed, but the Mongolians staying in Beiping are still keeping it secret.</p>
<p>Japanese Embassy Military Attaché Takeo Imai met with European and American reporters on the 24th, saying that the weather is hot now, and it is a good opportunity for everyone to travel and avoid the heat, and he believes that there will not be any problems at this time, but there are still obstacles in the situation in Hebei and Chahar, and methods will be gradually found to remove them.

<h3 id="e71">Hebei Province Completes Rural Cleanup; Decides to Continue Summer Defense; Formulates Plan and Orders All Counties to Comply; Decides to Officially Begin on August 1st <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Baoding correspondence: The Hebei Provincial Government, in order to consolidate local security in the province, specially requested the Department of Civil Affairs and the Security Department to jointly formulate a provincial rural cleanup plan, ordering all county governments to strictly comply. The main tasks included checking household registrations, organizing baojia (a system of mutual responsibility groups), and strengthening the county governments' capabilities to ensure smooth implementation. Chairman Song Zheyuan also ordered the troops stationed in various parts of the province to assist in the nearby areas. Since the start of the program, progress has been very rapid. The checking of household registrations and the organization of rural areas (five households form a neighborhood, five neighborhoods form a village, and two villages form a township) have been completed one after another, and reports have been sent to the province. At the same time as organizing rural areas, residents of each household have also signed mutual security pledges, with the five households in each neighborhood mutually guaranteeing each other and having the responsibility to supervise and report at any time. If illegal behavior is found in one household in a neighborhood and the other four households do not report it, then the other four households will also be subject to the same punishment. As a result, it is extremely difficult for illegal and unscrupulous elements to establish themselves locally, and the basic organization of the local people has formed an extremely sound and consolidated phenomenon. As for the organization of baojia, it is currently being carried out based on the results of the organization of rural areas. The provincial government has set a deadline of the end of August for completion, and the county governments are actively promoting it. In the future, after the baojia is organized, the local able-bodied men will receive considerable training, so that the local people will have sufficient self-defense capabilities. In the event of banditry, it will naturally be easier to eliminate, and the local people will have no chance to rebel. The provincial government has recently decided to carry out summer defense this year, as the rural cleanup work in various counties has been largely completed, but at this time when the green gauze screens are rising, it is inevitable that illegal elements will seize the opportunity to act. Furthermore, bandits have recently been frequently moving back and forth in the border areas of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, and many bandits are also lurking in the deep reed ponds in the Wen'an and Ba County areas. In addition to the county governments and local troops increasing their efforts to suppress them, the Department of Civil Affairs and the Security Department have formulated a plan for implementing summer defense this year. Security Director Zhang Yunrong presented it to Chairman Song for approval, and it was approved to be implemented as planned. Originally, it was planned to convene a provincial security conference of county magistrates, administrative commissioners, and county defense corps leaders to instruct them on the steps to implement summer defense. However, due to the importance of local security in various counties, it was feared that a lack of leadership would allow bandits to take advantage of the situation, so it was decided to change the form of the meeting and separately communicate this summer defense plan to the county governments, administrative commissioners, and county defense corps leaders, ordering them to advance the plan nearby. The main contents of the summer defense plan can be divided into three aspects: First, allocate the police and regiment forces of each county so that they are evenly and effectively used; second, strengthen the anti-bandit military forces of each county; and third, establish contact methods for joint defense and joint patrols in the border areas of each county. The provincial government has now formally promulgated this summer defense plan, ordering all counties to begin preparations and to begin summer defense on August 1. The provincial government attaches great importance to the liaison for joint defense and joint patrols between counties, ordering all county governments to immediately take action to establish contact nearby. In the event of banditry, they must mutually attack and jointly suppress the bandits, and must not sit idly by and allow them to roam, causing the banditry to spread. If any county encounters bandits and does not establish contact and allows them to cross into neighboring counties, the county magistrate will be subject to dismissal. The provincial government has repeatedly ordered all county governments to comply. Now, all counties have prepared thoroughly and are ready to begin summer defense on August 1. (July 24)</p>

<p>Wuhu correspondence: The China Agricultural Bank has been providing agricultural loans in Anhui for several years, which has helped regulate the rural economy in various counties. The increase in agricultural products has also been rapid. The bank, in order to benefit the entire province and truly benefit agriculture, is cooperating with the Anhui Provincial Rural Cooperation Committee to handle rural loans in various counties and towns, expanding the loan scope. Regarding the construction of provincial and county grain warehouses, the Anhui Grain Warehouse Management Office has also been in contact with the bank, which will provide large amounts of funds to complete the construction as soon as possible in order to store food. This year, in more than sixty counties in Anhui, except for a small number of high-lying fields in the northwest and east that have been slightly affected by drought, the harvests are better than in previous years. This is the best phenomenon since the major flood of the past twenty years. In the future, when the harvest is complete, the surplus grain will be managed and stored in grain warehouses by the province, waiting for prices to rise before selling, in order to prevent market monopolies and affect the farmers' economy. In addition, in order to circulate rural finances in Anhui Province, the Agricultural Bank plans to increase the number of farmer loan offices in Anqing, Wuhu, Tunxi, and Lu'an. Farmers can mortgage their clothing and utensils, with the monthly interest rate temporarily set at 1.5%, and they will be given convenient access, which is only 60% of the interest rate of ordinary pawnshops. The Wuhu loan office has already begun preparations, renting the former Futai pawnshop on Heng Street as its location and is currently renovating it. It will soon be able to start lending. Staff will be sent to other places to prepare. (July 24)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Suzhou: Conflict Between Merchants and Police Outside Xumen <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Outside the Xumen Wanning Bridge Main Street, around 9:00 PM on the 23rd, all the shops had closed, and the shop employees were cooling off in front of the shops. Due to the police arresting bare-chested people, a conflict broke out, and several merchants were beaten and injured by the police, with Xue Quan, the owner of the Xueshunxing Tinware Shop, being the most seriously injured. He was arrested and transferred to the branch office, which aroused public outrage and caused a great uproar. The next morning (24th), threatening notices were found in the doorways of the Da Youfu Sauce Garden and Tong Simao Native Products Shop, with a tone that seemed to be from the police. As a result, the shops were greatly dissatisfied and, after some discussion, planned to close down to show their opposition. Fifty-four shops jointly reported to the Wanning, Xujiang, and Zaoshi three-town office, requesting assistance. After town head Yu Shengzu and others came out to persuade them, they all started business around 10:00 AM. On the morning of the 25th, the town heads met with County Magistrate Deng and submitted a petition, expressing the citizens' dissatisfaction with the police and demanding the removal and punishment of the patrol officer and police. Cheng Ganqing, chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, also met with County Magistrate Deng at noon on the 25th to report everything and ask for instructions on how to handle the situation. County Magistrate Deng has ordered the Public Security Bureau to thoroughly investigate the matter before further action. Zhang, the director of the Public Security Bureau, dispatched Chief Inspector Lei on the 25th to conduct an impartial and thorough investigation.</p>

<p>The West Counter Grain Office in our county recently discovered that someone was forging grain certificates and fraudulently collecting national taxes, which is no different from forging banknotes and harming national revenue. The forger Zhou Laosi has been arrested and detained, awaiting disposal. Zhou Laosi, 38 years old, was originally an employee of the West Counter Micro-Grain Office of the county government and was very familiar with the internal situation. Later, due to his addiction, he left his position this spring. Zhou, feeling bored at home, came up with a wild idea and changed the appearance of old certificates from 1934 to fake new certificates, going to Xiqiao to fraudulently collect taxes. Many people were deceived. It was only when the tax collection official went to collect the money that the matter was discovered. After investigating, it was found that Zhou was responsible. The county government attaches great importance to this matter.</p>

<p>Zhou Jingyu, an accountant in the Bureau of Education, was reported for smoking opium. After verification, it was proven. However, when he was being sent back to the county government from the hospital, Zhou suddenly escaped from the police room out of fear of punishment. Afterwards, the bailiff was dismissed, and he was ordered to recapture him within three days. Chen Shu, the director of the Bureau of Education, presented a report to the county asking for punishment because he did not pay attention beforehand. The county government has now forwarded the report to the province for approval and has issued a warrant to all counties to arrest Zhou and bring him to justice.</p>

<p>After the silk mill strike throughout Wuxi County was resolved, the factories have resumed work as usual. However, the female workers of the Yongtai and Yongchang factories outside the South Gate mistakenly believed rumors that the factory had no intention of genuinely improving treatment, so they successively went on strike starting on the 23rd. The factory said that if the workers could not understand the factory's difficulties, then they could only let them do as they pleased. Therefore, on the morning of the 24th, the workers were not taken back to the factory, causing some workers to have no work to do, and the two sides reached a stalemate. This also affected the Dingchang and Minfeng factories, which also did not work that day. The female workers specially appointed representatives to report to the General Labor Union. Cadre Zhu Ruoyu and staff from the Industrial Labor Union held an emergency meeting at Qingming Bridge Elementary School and then went to Yongtai to negotiate with Assistant Manager Xue Zukang. The Public Security Bureau, fearing that the workers would gather everywhere, sent police to protect the area. After negotiations, it was decided: (1) The factory will take the workers back to the factory as usual on the morning of the 25th; (2) Wages will be in accordance with the standards set by the county government; (3) A standard clock will be hung in the workshop, and work will be carried out according to the specified time; (4) The staff will change to a more friendly attitude towards the workers. After the above items were confirmed, the workers' representatives expressed their satisfaction and immediately returned to inform the female workers. Yesterday, they returned to work as usual, restoring the original state.</p>

<p>Wang Azhong's house, located at No. 8 Tonghui Road, Wuqiao South, outside the North Gate of our county, caught fire around 10:00 PM the night before due to carelessness, causing a great conflagration. At that time, there was a strong wind and heavy rain, so the god of fire took advantage of the wind and raged, spreading to the neighboring Pinxian Tea House, Gao Quanrong, Zhang Xianyuan, and 14 other households. After the firefighters from the North District, sections 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, and Ximen heard the alarm, they drove to the scene to put out the fire. It took about an hour to extinguish the fire, but the buildings in the area had been reduced to ashes. The total loss is estimated to be over 20,000 yuan. When the fire was raging, Wu Xianzai, a resident of No. 9, was burned on the face and arms when he escaped from the fire. His daughter, Yan Qiaoyun, jumped from the building and injured her buttocks. Fortunately, the injuries are minor, and there is no danger to life. In addition, the house of Yang Gouda, located at No. 21 Jia, Section 3, Xijingzhen, outside the East Gate, suddenly caught fire around 1:00 AM yesterday (25th) and could not be contained, spreading to Shengxi Wang Lingen, Gu Axi, Zhu Linshi, and the neighbors Yang Ahe, Mao Julin, Qin Jinpei, Yang Hongyi, and eight other households, with losses of over 10,000 yuan. Yang Gouda and Yang Hongyi suffered the greatest losses because they were both newlyweds, and all their belongings were not salvaged.</p>

<p>Ni Shengfu, the abbess of the Jinghui Nunnery in Huaidong Township, Fourth District of Wuyi County, was targeted by thieves because the nunnery had some assets. On the night of the 23rd, seven or eight bandits, each carrying weapons and flashlights, entered by scaling the wall from the north, tying up more than a dozen nuns, large and small, burning Shengfu's breasts with fire, and beating her indiscriminately for about an hour before fleeing with the stolen goods. They planned to divide the loot outside Xiaonanmen, and one of the thieves, while walking along Chunting Bridge on Xinfeng Road, was caught by a watchman. The watchman and the local police took him to the Fifth Police Station of the First Public Security Bureau. The thief, named Li Ben, confessed to the robbery of the nunnery. Another suspect, Zhang Wenzi, who harbored the thief, was arrested and, along with Li Ben, was sent to the First Public Security Bureau on the 24th for investigation.</p>

<p>A shocking murder and concealment of a body occurred in Yong'anli, Zhengzhong Town, Xubu East Station, a few days ago. After much investigation, the case has become clear, but the murderer has already escaped before being discovered. The details are as follows: In Yong'anli, there is a resident named Wang Wenjin, who formerly held an important position in the Zhili-Lu Army. At the same time, there was a Shandong native, Jiang Bojue, who also served as a regimental commander in the Zhili-Lu Army, both of whom were subordinates of Chu Yupu. The two became friends and became sworn brothers. Wang betrothed his eldest daughter to Jiang Ziqing at the age of five. They were married in Tianjin in 1926. At that time, Jiang was 21 years old, and Wang's daughter was just entering her youthful years. Later, the Zhili-Lu Army was defeated, and Jiang Bojue was executed by Chu. Wang Wenjin became unemployed and temporarily worked as a receptionist at the Civilization Hotel. Qingwu became addicted to drugs and squandered his family property. After struggling to make a living in Tianjin and Beiping, he lost his job last winter and sent his wife back to Xuzhou to live with her mother's family. Qingwu himself also came to Xuzhou on the 12th of this month and lodged with his wife's mother. The mother-in-law, feeling that it was inconvenient for her 18-year-old second daughter to be at home, sent her to the countryside, leaving only the 8-year-old son named Yu De at home to live with his sister. Unexpectedly, Qingwu boarded a train north on the morning of the 20th, and his wife has been missing ever since. On the 22nd, the Wang family discovered that Wang had floated in a pile under the bed where Jiang lived, and there was a fishy smell. They reported to the baojia head and the Fourth Public Security Bureau sent police to monitor the excavation. A foul-smelling female corpse was found. There was a white cloth belt around her neck. The court was notified for inspection. Her tongue was protruding, her eyes were bulging, and her entire body was naked. It was confirmed that she had been strangled to death before being buried. The pit under the bed was three feet long and two feet wide, and the corpse was sitting upright inside. When the 8-year-old child Yu De, who lived in the same room and opposite the bed, was questioned, he said that he heard the sound of shouting in the opposite room on the night of the 19th. He called his sister but she did not respond. His brother-in-law said that a wolf had come and told him to sleep, so he went to sleep. The next morning, his brother-in-law washed his face and left, and he never saw his sister again. The testimony confirmed that it was her husband Jiang Qingwu who murdered her. As for the reason for the murder, neighbors said that the couple's relationship was good, but they had quarreled over money issues. The night before the murder, Jiang had asked his wife to borrow six yuan from a neighbor, claiming to return to Tianjin. Unexpectedly, he committed this heinous act at night. Wang's daughter has been coffined and buried by Wang Wenjin, awaiting the court's warrant for the arrest of Jiang Qingwu for legal action.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Minister Kong's Telegram Order to Zou and Song: Thoroughly Rectify Guangdong's Finances, Abolish Oppressive Taxes and Start Anew with the People, Unify the Currency System and Stabilize Finance <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently Minister of Finance, regarding Guangdong's finances, which have long been known to be chaotic, with particularly numerous oppressive levies and miscellaneous taxes, causing distress to society, the economy, and the people's livelihoods, now that the Guangdong situation has been stabilized and governance renewed, it is imperative to thoroughly rectify the situation and start anew with the people. Therefore, in addition to dispatching Finance Vice Minister Zou Lin to inspect the financial situation in the province, and appointing Song Zi Liang as the Special Commissioner of Guangdong Finance and concurrently Director of the Provincial Department of Finance, to be responsible for rectifying the province's finances, a telegram was specifically sent to Zou and Song yesterday, giving practical instructions on (1) rectifying finances, (2) abolishing oppressive levies, and (3) unifying the currency system. The original telegram is excerpted below:</p>
<p>(1) To Special Commissioner Song in Guangzhou: Upon reviewing the opening of Guangdong's sea ban, trade was at its peak, and the annual national and local tax revenue was considerable. Deep-seated malpractices are particularly severe, and the people's livelihood has been greatly harmed. The people of Guangdong have suffered greatly and eagerly await relief. Letters and telegrams requesting assistance have poured in. The Central Government is deeply concerned and compassionate towards the people of Guangdong and should immediately rectify the situation to improve their lives. Now that the Guangdong situation is largely settled and governance is being renewed, you, as the official responsible for rectifying the finances of the entire province, should strictly adhere to and implement the Central Government's unified measures for the division of national and local tax systems. All malpractices in tax collection should be thoroughly eliminated, so that the national treasury can be enriched above, and the people's burden can be lightened below. The Minister has high hopes for you. You are hereby urgently ordered to comply and report back for verification. Minister Kong, Yes.</p>
<p>(2) To Director Song, concurrently Commissioner in Guangzhou: Upon reviewing the Fourth National Financial Conference in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), in order to relieve the people's suffering, the Ministry specifically formulated a concrete plan to abolish oppressive levies and miscellaneous taxes, which was submitted to the National Government for clear orders and circulated for implementation. Subsequently, various provinces and cities such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Fujian, Henan, Hebei, Chahar, Shanxi, Shandong, Shaanxi, Gansu, Yunnan, Guizhou, and places like Peiping and Weihaiwei reported the abolition of over 5,000 tax items, amounting to over 50 million yuan annually. It is evident that most provinces were able to earnestly implement the plan, and the people's hardships were somewhat alleviated. However, in recent years, there have been no reports from Guangdong province regarding whether the aforementioned general orders have been implemented. According to elders and gentry in Guangdong, the people of Guangdong are still suffering from oppressive levies and miscellaneous taxes. The Minister is saddened by this. Now that the Guangdong situation has been stabilized and governance is renewed, and it is time to start anew with the people, all oppressive levies and miscellaneous taxes should be thoroughly abolished to demonstrate the Central Government's benevolence, rescue the people of Guangdong from their suffering, and comfort the hopes of the entire Guangdong region. You are hereby urgently ordered to report in detail whether the aforementioned orders have been complied with, so that it can be verified, and to propose concrete implementation measures for approval, in order to show the Central Government's concern for the southern border region. Minister Kong, Yes.</p>
<p>(3) To Vice Minister Zou and Special Commissioner Song in Guangzhou: Upon reviewing that Guangdong province has the earliest trade with overseas countries, its industry and commerce are well-developed, and there are many overseas Chinese in various places, with substantial remittances sent back to the country. Therefore, the unification of the currency system and the stability of finance in Guangdong province are not only related to the economy of the people of Guangdong, but also have a significant impact on China's overall international balance of payments. Last year, the Central Government implemented the legal tender policy, originally for the purpose of economic recovery. However, the former authorities in Guangdong province failed to fully understand this significance and earnestly implement the laws and regulations, merely adopting the name of legal tender and using the fractional currency issued by the provincial and municipal banks as legal tender. The issuance reserves were not in accordance with the Central Government's regulations, resulting in the excessive issuance of paper money, a sharp rise in the exchange rate between Hong Kong and Shanghai, financial instability, and harm to industry and commerce. The remittances of overseas Chinese were also greatly reduced, hindering the unification of the currency system and causing great losses to the social economy and people's livelihoods in Guangdong province. The Central Government, concerned about the overall situation, has repeatedly advised the province in order to unify the currency system and alleviate the suffering of the people of Guangdong, but the province has not sincerely complied. When the credit of the fractional currency greatly declined and it was unable to cope with foreign exchange, officials were sent to Beijing to seek assistance. The Central Government then ordered important personnel from the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to engage in frank discussions and formulate concrete measures, and sent personnel to Guangdong to facilitate the implementation. However, the province still showed no sincere intention to comply, resulting in the unresolved issue, and the financial markets, social economy, and people's livelihoods are still in a state of doubt and agitation. Now that the obstacles have been removed and governance has been renewed, rectifying finance and unifying the currency system are particularly urgent. You are hereby urgently ordered to promptly investigate the detailed situation, consult with the personnel sent by the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, and properly discuss concrete rectification measures to be submitted for approval and implementation, so that the finances of Guangdong province can be permanently stabilized, and industry and commerce can prosper, in order to fulfill the Central Government's concern for the southern border region. This is of utmost importance. Minister Kong, Yes.</p>

<p>At the China General Confederation of Labor yesterday, Standing Committee member Hu Xiyuan proposed that labor union members assist the National Anti-Smuggling Federation in preventing smuggling. The original text roughly stated that rampant smuggling endangers the foundation of the nation, and people have been appealing urgently, recognizing that if smuggling does not cease, there will be unimaginable disasters. Fortunately, the Anti-Smuggling Federations of Chambers of Commerce in various parts of the Republic of China have been established. This large-scale organization of private stakeholders is the most effective way to crack down on smuggling. However, the Anti-Smuggling Federations of Chambers of Commerce in various places are based on trade associations as units. Those public organizations that have not joined the Chambers of Commerce and enterprises that have not formed associations because they have fewer than seven members should all, based on their conscience, strictly inspect smuggling, so that the organization of private anti-smuggling efforts is not limited by region and extends to all levels of society, so that unscrupulous merchants have no way to escape, and the effectiveness of sanctions will be even stronger. This General Confederation and its branches in various places have an unshirkable duty to carry out anti-smuggling work. The General Confederation should notify all members and branches in various places to strictly inspect smuggling within the scope of their own business and assist anti-smuggling agencies in various places, so that the entire population is mobilized in the anti-smuggling work, to increase the strength of the Anti-Smuggling Federations of Chambers of Commerce in various parts of the Republic of China, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Banks and Money Shops Promote Discounting to Increase Capital <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai's industry and commerce have been affected by the global economic downturn, leading to closures and reorganizations. Since the implementation of the new currency system policy, various industries have gradually become active. To increase capital and revitalize the market, banks and money shops, such as the Bank of Communications and the China Development Bank, have taken the lead in promoting bill discounting. Since the implementation of commercial acceptance bills in various industries and the establishment of the Bank Bill Acceptance Center by the Bank Joint Reserve Committee, banks and money shops such as the National Goods Bank, the China-South Bank, the Continental Bank, and the Silk Industry Bank have successively handled bill discounting. At the same time, they also allow discounting of unmatured interest coupons for unified public bonds and drawn bonds that have not yet reached their redemption date. The Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications allow for the rediscounting of bills, so capital in the market is gradually increasing, and the turnover of funds is becoming more active.</p>

<h3 id="e93">New Rice Harvest in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui, Good Cotton Harvest Expected <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>According to Huadong News Agency, the National Labor Survey Agency in this city received a telegram from Hankou yesterday, stating that the new rice in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui has been launched and is being sold for only about 6.12 yuan per dan (equivalent to 160 market catties), and the farmers are all overjoyed. The Yangtze River water level is five to six feet lower than last year, and the fields on both sides have benefited greatly. With such even rainfall, there is a full harvest, which is the most prosperous event in decades. From then on, the situation in Guangdong is stabilized, and Hunan and Jiangxi rice can be directly transported to Guangdong province via the Yuehan Railway (currently being prepared for opening to traffic), without the need to purchase Siamese and Saigon rice. The domestic economy is able to recover. The phrase "natural disasters and man-made calamities" can be said to be no longer applicable to China in the future. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Harvest in Four Provinces</p>
<p>A major financial institution received a confirmed report from Hankou yesterday stating that the new rice in Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Anhui has begun to be launched, with round grains and upright ears. In particular, the two beaches along the Yangtze River in Hubei and Anhui have a bumper harvest. On average, each acre of land has about 10 yuan of output. After paying rent and taxes, farmers still have a surplus of three or four yuan. If there are no deficits in previous years, it can cover expenses for half a year to nine months. Therefore, the farmers in the four provinces are all extremely happy.</p>
<p>Low Rice Prices</p>
<p>The price of this new rice is only 6.12 yuan per dan, with an average of less than 4 yuan per hundred catties, which is even cheaper than wheat and flour. If farmers mix in coarse grains such as barley and broad beans, and supplement it with vegetables, one dou of rice can support each person for half a month to twenty days. Farmers are the most frugal. From now on, if political stability can be achieved, they will be able to live and work in peace.</p>
<p>Direct Transportation to Guangdong</p>
<p>In previous years, the rice needed by the people of Guangdong province, in addition to a very small portion produced by the province itself, was purchased from Siam and Saigon, resulting in considerable annual losses. In the past, it was not because of political anomalies that they were unwilling to interact with other provinces in the country, but because transportation was blocked, and buying domestic rice was more expensive than foreign rice. From now on, with the Yuehan Railway directly transporting it, and also through state-run shipping agencies, directly transporting it from Wuhan to Guangzhou via Shanghai, the combined price will definitely not exceed the price of foreign rice. Politics and economy are linked together, which is especially beneficial to the National Economic Construction Movement.</p>
<p>Shallow Yangtze River</p>
<p>The agency also received the same report stating that the Yangtze River water level is only five to six feet from the same period last year. Its water level does not change due to the construction of embankments, but is based on actual records. If the embankments on both sides can be repaired and dredged at all times, the fields will benefit. Compared to human methods, the results can be doubled with half the effort. This is called the source of Heaven's help for success, vaguely like the omen of China's rejuvenation.</p>
<p>Cotton Growth</p>
<p>Furthermore, cotton is growing vigorously due to even rainfall and moderate sunny and rainy weather. In recent decades, there has been less rain and more sun, which is particularly beneficial for weeding. This year, the National Economic Committee and the Cotton Industry Control Committee, in conjunction with the banking industry, continue to provide economic assistance, and dispatch technical personnel to the cotton-producing areas to "share the hardships" with farmers. As a result of thorough improvement, it is expected that this year's autumn harvest will exceed 110 million dan. After three years, there will be no need for foreign cotton supply, and after five years, there may be surplus goods for export.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Lawyer Ma Junshuo Returned to China Yesterday and Arrived in Shanghai, Will Compile a Report and Submit It to the Judicial Yuan <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Shanghai's famous lawyer Dr. Ma Junshuo was ordered by the Judicial Yuan in January last year to go to various countries in Europe, America, and Japan to investigate judicial affairs. After going abroad, Mr. Ma passed through Japan, England, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Brazil, the Netherlands, Belgium, and other countries, and was personally received by the judicial leaders and chief judges of the Supreme Court, prosecutors, etc. of each country, and was well received. He also attended the National Conference of Commercial Courts in France. At the same time, he promoted the progress of Chinese law and judicial reform in order to abolish consular jurisdiction in the future. Mr. Ma also took advantage of this trip to browse foreign legal books and had in-depth discussions with legal scholars. His comparative legal system thesis was evaluated by the Graduate School of New York University in the United States, and he was awarded a Doctor of Jurisprudence degree. He also won praise from Professor Essera of the University of Paris, the National Government Advisor, and Provost Punt of Harvard University in the United States. Mr. Ma returned to China by ship from Italy last month and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. When interviewed by reporters and asked about his impressions of this trip, he said that the legal systems of various countries have their own strengths, but what is applicable to country A may not be suitable for country B. I investigated their differences and used them as a reference for what suits China's national conditions. Last year, President Ju and Vice President Tan and others convened a national judicial conference and established the China Law Society to bring together judicial organs, academia, and the legal profession to jointly study and improve China's judicial system. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, thanks to the planning and improvement of Dr. Wang Liangchou, the former President of the Judicial Yuan, the situation has been impressive. The current President Ju and Minister Wang have also made many contributions. If sufficient judicial funding can be fully determined and specialized talents can be selected, then the future of our judiciary has unlimited hope. The most important thing I paid attention to in this investigation of the legal systems of various countries was: (1) the English circuit trial system. This system can also be found in ancient China; (2) juvenile courts and educational institutions; (3) new prisons, of which Wormwood Scrub in the United Kingdom is more complete, with facilities such as schools, hospitals, and factories, and chapels of three religions. Due to limited funding, it is difficult for our country's prisons to imitate them for a while. However, it is heard that Minister Wang is actively carrying out the construction of new prisons and the transformation of old prisons; (4) Regarding the prosecutorial system, I had long discussions with Prosecutor General Maitre of the French Supreme Court and Professor Essera; (5) the lawyer system; (6) maritime courts and labor courts, etc. I will compile a report based on the above points and submit it to the Judicial Yuan, and plan to jointly study it with the legal community.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Shanghai Grain Merchants Association Telegraphed Guangdong Province Requesting Reduction of Miscellaneous Taxes <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chen Dayi, supervisor of the Mixed Sugar Association and executive director of the Oil Mill Association, stated that since Chen Jitang took power in Guangdong, no customs duties have been levied on imported foreign rice. Instead, various agricultural products from other provinces transported to Guangdong have been subjected to exorbitant and abnormal taxes. Merchants have long harbored resentment. Now that Chen has left and political orders are unified, the association has issued three official letters to President Jiang of the Executive Yuan, Special Commissioner Song of the Guangdong Finance Department, and Director Yu of the Guangdong Pacification Commission, requesting a reduction of miscellaneous taxes on agricultural products transported from various provinces to Guangdong. The original text of their letter to Director Yu is recorded below. Chen Jitang, while holding the reins of Guangdong's administration, pursued his ambition to expand the provincial treasury, disregarded the central government's financial system, falsely advocated the noble cause of preventing foreign goods from encroaching on the market, established a special agricultural tax bureau, specialized in taxing goods imported from other provinces, and practiced violent levies and exorbitant exactions, exhausting all means of exploitation. The burdens were as harsh as fire and water, causing the people immense suffering. During the recent changes in Guangdong and Guangxi, Chen realized he could not stand firm, resigned, and retreated. Political orders have returned to unification. The central government has appointed Your Excellency, trusting you to rejuvenate Guangdong's administration and dispel the clouds to reveal the blue sky. At this moment of universal joy and anticipation of new policies, our association dares to meticulously present several aspects of Chen's past actions that harmed the people and caused deep pain. (1) The import tax on foreign rice has long been implemented by the government's general order, with the aim of protecting domestic rice and relieving rural areas. However, Guangdong province acted independently, with the Guangdong Customs not levying taxes on imported foreign rice, but rather the special agricultural tax bureau collecting special taxes. The intention was to seize national taxes to enrich provincial taxes, thereby undermining the tax system and failing to plug the loopholes. This not only harmed the national treasury's income but also hindered the development of rural areas, acting perversely and daring no one to criticize. This year, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and other provinces have experienced abundant harvests. Guangdong province is inherently a rice-deficient area, and with the convenience of the Yuehan Railway, it could unify the foreign rice tax collection, block imports, and instead obtain surplus rice from Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui. This supply and demand could be balanced. However, due to the imposition of customs duties, foreign rice has encroached upon the market, causing rice from Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui to sigh in vain. Moreover, provinces in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are rich in rice production but have little demand, leading to a lack of sales, concerns about deterioration, and a sharp drop in market prices, causing great suffering to the people. Fortunately, Guangdong province has returned its administration to the central government, without the narrow vision of regionalism. It is requested to urgently unify customs tax collection to comply with the national tax system, allowing the circulation of domestic rice and aiding in the relief of rural areas. This is the first point. (2) Oilseeds and beans are daily necessities in people's diets. Guangdong province produces none and relies entirely on imports from other provinces for supply. However, the special agricultural tax bureau levies a tax of five yuan and four jiao in silver dollars per dan on imported raw oil, bean oil, sesame oil, and rapeseed oil, and one yuan and eight jiao plus change per dan on raw kernels, beans, sesame seeds, and rapeseed. The tax rate is higher than anything else. The transfer of goods within the country should not be subject to repeated taxation. This was decided at the National Financial Conference in the 22nd year of the Republic of China. Chen disregarded national laws and regulations, ignored the people's burdens, and indulged in exploitation, which is truly hateful. Now that Your Excellency has been ordered to preside over Guangdong's administration, you should prioritize relieving the people's suffering. The special taxes previously levied on oilseeds and beans, which are vital to the people's livelihood, should be urgently abolished. This is the second point. (3) Cake (bran) is a fertilizer for farmland, and Guangdong farmers need a large amount annually. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, Guangdong province began levying a surcharge on imported fertilizer to fund the construction of Zhongshan University, at a rate of eight jiao per dan. Merchants attempted to levy this surcharge on domestic cake, but after vigorous protests from related groups in various regions, a proclamation from the former Finance Department exempted all domestically produced bran in Guangdong and other provinces. In May of the 23rd year, merchants again associated domestically produced cake with products from the three northeastern provinces and levied a surcharge. After several protests, the former Southwest Political Affairs Council decided that bran transported to Guangdong that was not produced in the three northeastern provinces would be exempt from the surcharge. In September of last year, the old case was revived. The previous levy of three jiao in small silver dollars per dan on cake imported from the three northeastern provinces was changed to two jiao and five fen in silver dollars. The previous exemption for cake transported from ports in Tianjin, Qingdao, the Yangtze River, and Shanghai was also changed to a levy of two jiao and five fen in silver dollars. Our association believed that domestic oil mills were in their infancy and their vitality would be cut off, so we repeatedly appealed for the abolition of the tax but without effect. We then petitioned the Fifth National Congress, which decided to transfer the matter for rectification. It was not until May 1 of this year that the rate was reduced to one jiao and five fen in silver dollars per dan. Recently, we received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance stating that the Southwest Political Affairs Council had decided to wait until the current merchant contract for the Zhongshan University bean cake donation expired before exempting all domestic cake, while fertilizer from foreign countries and the three northeastern provinces would still be taxed as before. The merchant's contract is set to expire in September of this year, so the abolition of this domestic cake surcharge should not be far off. However, it is currently the peak season for fertilizing farmland and selling cake. To alleviate the burden on farmers and facilitate merchants' sales, it is appropriate to abolish the tax in a timely manner. As the saying goes, "Let the people rest a little from their labor." If we wait until the merchant's contract expires, supply and demand will have passed their peak, and the benefit to farmers and merchants will be minimal. We now implore Your Excellency to abolish this cake donation, which harms farmers and merchants, on a specified date, strictly ordering merchants to comply. Fertilizer and cake transported to Guangdong from foreign countries and the three northeastern provinces should still be taxed as before, to protect domestic products and alleviate merchants' difficulties. This is the third point. In summary, Chen Jitang contended with the people for profit, and the people's suffering under his oppressive policies was unprecedented. The above points are of utmost importance to the people's livelihood and should be included in Your Excellency's careful planning. Our association dares to reiterate its sincere plea, deeply hoping that you will adopt and implement it swiftly. We await your command with apprehension. Sincerely, Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Shanghai Grain, Oil, and Cake Industry Association.</p>

<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, Gao Bingfang and Liang Jingchun, Director and Deputy Director of the Preparatory Office for Central Direct Taxes of the Ministry of Finance, came to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday to seek instructions from Minister Kong regarding the implementation of income tax. Gao has already returned to Beijing, while Liang remains in Shanghai to handle other matters. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency visited Liang yesterday to inquire about the date of income tax implementation and the method of collection. Liang provided the following information:</p>
<p>Visiting Minister Kong to Submit Detailed Rules for Review</p>
<p>According to Liang, he and Director Gao Bingfang came to Shanghai from Beijing on the 22nd. Yesterday (i.e., the 24th), they visited Minister Kong and submitted the drafted provisional regulations and detailed rules for income tax for Kong's review. The detailed rules consist of 60 articles. After Minister Kong reviews them, they will be taken to Beijing for review by experts and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation. Director Gao has completed his business and returned to Beijing, while Liang will remain until next Monday to handle other matters before returning to Beijing.</p>
<p>Implementation Nationwide on September 1</p>
<p>The definite date for income tax implementation is expected to be September 1. It will be implemented uniformly nationwide. The provisional regulations have been completed through legislative procedures and have been officially promulgated by the National Government. The detailed rules have also been drafted. After Minister Kong reviews them, they will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. The method of collection is clearly stipulated in the detailed rules and awaits Minister Kong's decision. In the future, foreign nationals will also be taxed according to the regulations. Chinese citizens overseas will also be required to pay taxes in accordance with the laws of the respective European and American countries. Once income tax is implemented, the annual revenue is expected to be between 30 and 50 million yuan in the initial one or two years.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Britain and the United States Resist the Import of Chinese Eggs, and the National Trade Bureau Seeks Solutions, Submitting Five Measures to the Ministry of Industry for Approval, and Consulting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Negotiate with the United States Regarding Increased Tax Rates <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shenshi News, Chinese eggs and egg products rank third among exported goods, with Britain, Germany, and the United States being the destinations. Recently, Britain and the United States have become wary of the activity of Chinese products and are eager to cultivate their domestic productivity. Therefore, they restrict the progress of Chinese egg products. In particular, since Germany has controlled foreign exchange, the export of Chinese egg products to Germany has been severely impacted. Observing the trend of trade, the future is concerning. The Ministry of Industry is paying close attention to this and, in addition to consulting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct ambassadors abroad to pay attention, is also instructing the National Trade Bureau to actively resolve the issue. At the same time, the Anglo-Chinese Trade Association, jointly formed by the Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce and the China International Trade Association, is also paying attention to this matter for the sake of promoting Sino-British trade and is submitting five improvement measures to the Ministry of Industry for approval. The five measures are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Improve Egg Production</p>
<p>Research and improve egg production. Representatives from the Egg Industry Association, the Commodity Inspection Bureau, and the Anglo-Chinese Trade Association should be selected to form an egg product improvement committee. Experts should be hired to establish sites for researching and promoting improved chicken breeds and increasing production. At the same time, guidance should be provided on feeding and disease prevention. In addition to donations from the above-mentioned institutions, the government should provide monthly subsidies, following the example of the China United Sericulture Improvement Association.</p>
<p>Education and Propaganda</p>
<p>Use education and propaganda to instill knowledge of chicken farming in domestic farmers. Currently, private individuals are running chicken farming magazines, but their strength is weak and their effectiveness is limited. In the future, more publications should be added, using simple language to convey methods of feeding and disease prevention to the public, so that they know how to improve.</p>
<p>Propaganda Towards Britain</p>
<p>British egg merchants, seeing the activity of Chinese egg products in the British market, have been vigorously promoting that Chinese egg products are of poor quality, advocating for a ban on imports or an increase in tax rates to restrict them. The export of Chinese eggs to Britain has been greatly impacted. Although this destructive propaganda has temporarily stopped in recent years, China must actively promote and expand propaganda for the sake of developing the egg industry. The government should print English booklets explaining the cleanliness of Chinese egg factories and the completeness of inspection work. In addition, the process from rural chicken farming to egg product export should be filmed and screened at gatherings of British community groups to increase the strength and effectiveness of propaganda.</p>
<p>Reduce and Exempt Taxes</p>
<p>China's export tariffs are one of the country's annual revenues. In this time of financial difficulty, it is difficult to exempt them all. However, it has been found that eggs transported from inland areas such as Wuhu to Shanghai have already been taxed. After these eggs arrive in Shanghai, they are converted into liquid, packaged, and exported, and the Shanghai Customs still levies export duties. This system of taxing the same goods twice should be changed. When the country's tax revenue is slightly more abundant in the future, export tariffs should be eliminated.</p>
<p>Expand Inspection</p>
<p>In addition to analyzing the content of egg products using chemical methods, the certification of egg factories is also very important. Currently, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau inspects egg factories only in Shanghai. Egg factories in inland areas have not yet been included in the scope of inspection due to the long distance. In the future, they should also be inspected, so that there will be more strength in promoting the cleanliness of Chinese egg products abroad.</p>
<p>Progress Overview</p>
<p>It is reported that the Ministry of Industry has accepted the above-mentioned proposals and immediately ordered the National Trade Bureau to discuss with relevant parties, and then convene representatives from various egg factories for detailed research. Endings have been discussed for the five measures, and the export of egg products will be increased in the future. As for the United States, there has also been a proposal to increase taxes on egg products recently. In addition to the Ministry of Industry forwarding the proposal to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct the ambassador to the United States to negotiate properly, the National Trade Bureau has also gathered major egg merchants to discuss remedies and countermeasures, and there is already a considerable path.</p>
<h3 id="e101">The Sihai Steamer: Replacement of the International Safety Certificate Valid Today; Passengers to Hong Kong Not Affected <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Chinese merchant ships sailing to Hong Kong and carrying passengers must have an international safety certificate and must be approved by the British government and recognized by the Hong Kong authorities in order to sail. Among the Chinese ships that can carry passengers to Hong Kong, only the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Sihai is authorized. Last year, the company fought for equal treatment for Chinese shipowners and had to negotiate with various countries to allow the Sihai to carry passengers in Hong Kong. After a long period of negotiation, they succeeded, and the international safety certificate issued by the Ministry of Communications was officially recognized as valid by the Hong Kong authorities for a period of one year. As of the 25th of this month, the first international safety certificate for the Sihai has expired. Before the new certificate is obtained, passengers to Hong Kong cannot be carried according to regulations. This issue occurred when the Haizhen steamer sailed the day before yesterday. The company had already requested the ministry to replace the certificate, but it had not been issued due to procedural reasons. Due to business and route reasons, the company specially sent personnel to Beijing to urge the issuance of the certificate, which has now been obtained and given to the Haizhen steamer first, so that the new certificate will take effect from today (the 26th). The remaining Haiyuan, Haily, and Haiheng are also being delivered to the shipowners for safekeeping, so that the Hong Kong authorities can inspect them. The safety equipment of the four ships has been further refined. Each ship has eight lifeboats with a capacity of 376 people, plus 10 floats with a capacity of 200 people, 16 lifebuoys, and 1200 life jackets. The load line of the two parts of the hull is set at a freeboard of 7 feet 8 inches for all four ships. The new safety certificate will be uniformly changed starting today, so passengers to Hong Kong on the four ships can still ride as usual and will not be blocked, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Measures for Delivering Agricultural Products Within a Specified Time Limit: The Ministry of Railways Formulated a Circular to All Railways to Implement on August 1 <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus received a circular from the Ministry of Railways stating that the ministry had previously drafted "Regulations on the Number of Days and Calculation Method for Specifying Time Limits" and "Regulations on the Start and End of Specified Time Limits" for the case of agricultural products delivered within a specified time limit and ordered all railways to review and discuss them. Reports have now been received in succession, and they can generally be followed. The ministry has specially revised the previous regulations slightly in accordance with the opinions of various railways. From now on, all agricultural product transportation that is not a full military unit or a full truck on each railway should uniformly arrive within the specified time limit according to the distance traveled. The methods are as follows: (A) Regulations on the number of days and calculation method for specifying time limits: (1) One day (24 hours) for the first 1 to 100 kilometers, half a day (12 hours) for the first 101 to 200 kilometers, and an additional half a day (12 hours) for every 150 kilometers or less after 200 kilometers, and so on; (2) Add one day for goods that are not a full truck; (3) Add one day for full truck goods loaded and unloaded by the railway (half a day for loading, half a day for unloading); (4) Add one day for goods that pass through the capital ferry or need to be barged across the river; (5) Add half a day for each joint track station passed (six hours for the delivering railway, six hours for the receiving railway). The Maigen Road on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways should be regarded as a joint track station; (6) Add half a day for full truck and non-full truck goods originating from a branch line; (7) For goods passing through more than two railways, the date should be calculated separately according to the mileage of each railway, and the total mileage of each connecting railway should not be accumulated. (B) Regulations on the start and end of specified time limits: (1) For non-full truck goods, from the time of consignment to the time of unloading; (2) For full truck goods, one, for those loaded and unloaded by the railway, from the time of loading to the time of unloading; two, for those loaded and unloaded by the consigner, from the time of completion of loading and preparation for shunting to the time of arrival and delivery. The above two methods should be implemented uniformly by each railway from August 1 of this year as the standard for supervising the management of agricultural product transportation by the dispatching, scheduling, and station staff. As for the audit method of these specified time limit regulations, the vehicle affairs office of each railway should formulate a plan according to the situation of the railway and submit it to the ministry for review in order to plan a unified method and issue a circular for compliance. Furthermore, the period from consignment to allocation of vehicles is more complicated and no time limit is temporarily specified, but each railway should try its best to make it fast to benefit the consigner and should comply with the following six principles shown in the instruction No. 1911 issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on May 4 of this year: (1) Repair locomotives and vehicles as soon as possible during the slack season in the summer to be used in the peak months; (2) Road coal, stone ballast, and other materials and road member coal and other non-time-sensitive goods should be transported in advance in the summer; (3) Transport agricultural products as they arrive without causing backlog; (4) Speed up loading and unloading work and implement night loading and unloading; (5) Open scheduled direct freight cars as much as possible, increase the number of times, and increase their speed; (6) Make a comprehensive plan in advance and temporarily reduce coal transportation and other transportation when necessary to transfer agricultural products. In addition to separate orders, this order is for compliance and reporting. The bureau has forwarded this order to the vehicle affairs office for compliance and reporting, it is said.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications previously established a telephone exchange at Dajing Town and connected it to the Zhabei Telephone Branch Bureau to meet the needs of residents for telephone communication. Later, due to the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the machine lines were destroyed, residents moved away one after another, and telephone service was interrupted. After the war, because the vitality of the people had not recovered and business was not booming, the Telephone Bureau set up several public telephones and subscriber telephones in the town to temporarily cope with the situation. In recent years, the town's market has gradually become prosperous and the number of residents has also increased, and there have been many requests to install telephones every month. The Telephone Bureau immediately planned and prepared, and presented it to the Ministry of Communications, and leased several houses in Pushan Villa in the town to restore the original exchange and install a 50-door magneto exchange to transfer all existing telephones to the exchange. Four pairs of trunk lines are available between the Zhabei Telephone Branch Bureau and the Dajing New Exchange, so that incoming and outgoing telephone traffic can be smooth. Since the Telephone Bureau began planning and preparing two months ago, various projects are about to be completed, and it is expected that official service will begin on August 1. The telephone number of the exchange has also been determined to be "41151." Outside calls should dial "41151" first and then transfer to the area. Users must also dial this number first and then connect.</p>

<p>The Municipal Police Bureau, due to the previous cracking of a case involving Wenzhou natives like Chen Heming and others forging passports for going abroad, had transferred several individuals to the court for investigation. It is now reported that these fake passports were mostly counterfeited from those issued by the Guangdong Public Security Bureau. All rubber stamps, hard seals, vermillion seals, and signatures were meticulously carved to resemble genuine passports, making them easy to use to slip abroad. Currently, many are scattered across European countries. Furthermore, the value of these fake passports is approximately fifty yuan each, totaling over four hundred yuan with the ship ticket, equivalent to a genuine passport. Many petty traders were fooled by this. Now, several European countries, such as Belgium and the Netherlands, have inspected and found twelve peddlers holding fake passports (all from Wenzhou and Chuzhou areas). All were detained, escorted onto ships, and deported. They arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, and because their funds were exhausted, they temporarily returned to their hometowns. It is said they will negotiate with Chen Heming for compensation.</p>

<p>Lu Chao, a 26-year-old woman from Guangdong, resides at No. 3, Lane 300, Beidang Road, in the French Concession. Her brother, Lu Yuzhang, works at the Shanghai Power Company in the International Settlement. Lu Chao lives with her elderly mother. Yesterday morning, around 9:00 AM, a strange young man in a Western suit knocked on their door. He claimed that someone from Beijing had sent several packages and requested someone to accompany him to retrieve them. Lu Chao received him and then asked her mother to go with the young man in the Western suit. As they walked to the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Avenue Albert, the young man asked Lu's mother to wait, saying he would be right back with the packages. At this time, Lu Chao feared something might happen, so she followed them with their maid. When they reached the intersection of Avenue Albert and Avenue Joffre, they saw her mother standing by the roadside, waiting for a long time. The young man in the Western suit did not return. Lu Chao became suspicious, fearing that the young man was a bandit using a diversion tactic to rob her home. She immediately called the French police and reported that there were robbers at her house. Upon receiving the report, the police immediately dispatched a full contingent of Chinese and foreign detectives in armored vehicles to Lu's residence to make arrests. However, they found no robbery in progress. The police brought Lu Chao, the reporter, to the police station for questioning. According to her statement, the young man in the Western suit acted suspiciously, so she speculated that his behavior was improper and suspected a robbery plan, hence the prior report to the police. The police chief, after hearing the statement, reprimanded Lu and ordered her to return home. However, the police detectives wasted a trip, and Lu's neighbors were alarmed by the false alarm.</p>

<p>Lawyer Gu Wenguang, styled Doucai, is a native of Qingpei, Jiangsu. He joined the Lawyers Association in March of the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935). His office is located on the second floor of the Dahuxia Building on Nanjing Road, and his home is at No. 7, Xilin Lane, Jin Shenfu Road, in the French Concession.

<h3 id="e123">Illegal Actions of French Water and Electricity Company - Taxpayers' Association Requests Cease and Desist - Instigating Police Detectives to Cut Off Electricity; Penalties Imposed Without Court Trial <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession, based on a report from citizen Zhang Linchen, stated that the French Water and Electricity Company instigated the police to illegally cut off electricity, unlawfully detain light users, and impose huge fines. A letter was sent to the French Municipal Council requesting them to stop. The letter stated: "To the esteemed Municipal Council, according to a letter from Zhang Linchen of Zhang Yisheng Noodleshop at No. 468 Xujiahui Road, at 2:00 PM on June 10th, Western officials from the French Water and Electricity Company, accompanied by French police detectives, came to the shop and accused him of stealing electricity. They immediately cut off the electricity. The next morning, the citizen went to the police station to turn himself in. A Western policeman, without investigating, physically assaulted him, knocking out the citizen's front teeth and causing the citizen's wife's ear to bleed. He was ordered to pay a fine of 300 yuan. After repeated pleas, the fine was reduced to 120 yuan, with 80 yuan paid first, with the remaining 40 yuan to be paid off by the end of June. On July 2nd, because he was unable to pay, the electricity was cut off again. We believe that the citizens are ignorant and can only be at their mercy under this threat of violence. We have heard that your Council can uphold justice and fairness, so we are sending this letter to request your Council to ask the French Municipal Council to correct the errors of the Water and Electricity Company, to negotiate for the reconnection of electricity, and to return the fine of 80 yuan. If there is evidence of electricity theft by a light user, the Water and Electricity Company should consult with a specialized electrical engineer from the Municipal Council for verification before action is taken. The Water and Electricity Company did not follow the legal procedure and rashly instigated the police to arrest people, illegally cut off electricity, unlawfully detain light users, and assault them physically. Afterwards, they did not send them to the court for punishment, but instead allowed the police station to impose penalties at will. All of these actions are obviously in violation of the law. Therefore, we are forwarding this information and requesting the Municipal Council to stop all illegal actions of the Water and Electricity Company and to order the police station to return the fine of 80 yuan to Zhang Yisheng and restore the electricity supply to ensure business stability. Sincerely, To the French Concession Municipal Council."</p>
<h3 id="e124">Rickshaw Guild Requests the Vehicle Committee to Supplement Registration and Postpone Inspection <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The police department of the Shanghai Municipal Council is arbitrarily punishing rickshaw pullers by inspecting their armbands. The Rickshaw Guild has asked the Vehicle Committee to supplement registration and determine how to handle rickshaw pullers leaving Shanghai. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Investigation of Armbands, Detention and Punishment</p>
<p>The Public Security Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council started to inspect the armbands of rickshaw pullers on all roads from the 16th of this month. However, the number of registered rickshaw pullers in each rickshaw company is gradually decreasing, and coolies from other places are applying to pull rickshaws. Those found by the Public Security Department without licenses are detained and fined one yuan. In the past ten days, more than 400 people have been fined. Yesterday, the Special District Rickshaw Industry Association issued a statement regarding the registration of rickshaw pullers. The Vehicle Committee conducted registration for 40,000 people from the 23rd to the 24th year of the Republic of China (1934-1935). However, this period coincided with the busy farming season in northern Jiangsu, and most rickshaw pullers returned to their hometowns to farm. By the time they returned to Shanghai, they had lost the opportunity to register and were unable to pull rickshaws. The number of unemployed rickshaw pullers is 20,000 to 30,000, and their livelihoods are threatened, which is very miserable. For example, in April of this year, when the Municipal Council allowed the continued registration of 5,000 people, the actual number of people who came to register at that time was more than 20,000, which is enough to prove the accuracy of the Association's statistics on unemployed rickshaw pullers. These unemployed rickshaw pullers have been pulling rickshaws for many years and have no other skills or capital to switch to other industries. The rural areas of northern Jiangsu are bankrupt, and there is no other way out except to pull rickshaws. In the past, unregistered rickshaw pullers could still replace registered ones to make a living, but recently the Vehicle Committee requested the Public Security Department to strictly inspect the armbands, so hundreds of unregistered rickshaw pullers have been detained and fined. Rickshaw companies are suffering from the downturn in the rickshaw business, and the large number of unemployed rickshaw pullers makes it impossible to provide relief. Now that it is summer, most of the registered rickshaw pullers have returned to their hometowns to farm, so there are more rickshaws than pullers. Although the Vehicle Committee stipulates that when a rickshaw puller leaves Shanghai, the rickshaw owner can recommend a temporary rickshaw puller, most rickshaw pullers leave without saying goodbye, and refuse to hand over their armbands. Rickshaw owners cannot know their whereabouts and cannot introduce temporary rickshaw pullers. Many rickshaws have been parked in recent days. At the same time, tens of thousands of unregistered rickshaw pullers want to register but cannot. This is a distorted social phenomenon.</p>
<p>Supplement Registration and Postpone Inspection</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Special District Office of the Rickshaw Guild sent a letter to the Rickshaw Committee, requesting to supplement registration and postpone inspection. The original text reads: "To the respected Committee, it has been found that since your Committee limited the number of rickshaw pullers to 41,330 last year, some rickshaw pullers have lost the opportunity to register because they were limited by the quota, and others occasionally returned to their hometowns to farm. The number of people who are unable to pull rickshaws and are unemployed has reached tens of thousands. This Association has repeatedly reported that these unemployed rickshaw pullers have no rickshaws to pull and their lives are very difficult, which has a major impact on the future of society. This Association has repeatedly reported the situation and requested an increase in the quota to save the rickshaw pullers. In March of this year, your Committee resumed increasing the quota by 5,000 people. This Association considered that there were too few porridge and too many monks, which was not enough to distribute. This Association requested that your Committee consider increasing the number, and you agreed to register 5,000 people first and then consider increasing the number later. Now, the quota of 5,000 people has been fully registered by the introduction of rickshaw owners, but the number of people who are unable to register due to the quota limit is still very large. According to reports from rickshaw owners, the Public Security Department suddenly executed the inspection of rickshaw puller registration certificates on the 16th of this month, and all those who pull rickshaws without licenses have been detained and fined. In the past few days, hundreds of rickshaw pullers have been punished, and the community is in a state of panic, and they are unable to make ends meet all day long. Also, now that it is summer, most of the registered rickshaw pullers have returned to their hometowns to farm. Rickshaw owners cannot find out their whereabouts and request replacements. The number of rickshaws is more than the number of pullers, and many rickshaws are parked. At the same time, the families of the general unemployed rickshaw pullers are waiting to be fed, which is very miserable. Therefore, we respectfully present three points, hoping that you will consider them: (1) We should consider the livelihood of the poor and allow the expansion of the quota and supplement the registration of rickshaw pullers to help the unemployed rickshaw pullers. (2) We should clearly define the measures for examining rickshaw pullers leaving Shanghai in order to facilitate inspection and benefit the rickshaw industry. (3) Please inform the Public Security Department to consider the livelihood of the poor and postpone the inspection and punishment. The above three points are related to the livelihood of rickshaw pullers. Please approve them to benefit the rickshaw industry and help the rickshaw pullers. We deeply look forward to it."</p>

<p>The French Concession Municipal Council has recently started to levy a classified business tax on tobacco exchange shops within the concession and collect investigation fees. Yesterday, Shenhe Tai, located at the Caishi Road intersection, sent a letter to the Tobacco Exchange Industry Association's Punan Office, requesting to convene a joint meeting of relevant trade associations and industry representatives to discuss countermeasures. The office has already sent letters on their behalf to the Sauce and Wine Guild, the Coal Oil Guild, the Match Guild, and the Candle Guild, and notified the industry as follows: "To all esteemed colleagues, we have recently received a letter from Shenhe Tai Tobacco Exchange Shop at No. 87 Caishi Road, Lafayette Road, in the French Concession, stating that a Westerner and a Chinese official from the French Municipal Council's Business Classification Office came to the shop and forced them to obtain a sanitary license and pay an investigation fee of ten yuan in advance. If they delay, they will be fined tens or hundreds of yuan. Merchants are struggling to survive in this economic downturn, which has reached an extreme point. How can they be subjected to further oppression? Therefore, we specifically request your association to provide assistance and quickly negotiate with the Bureau to waive the fine and donation in order to maintain our business. According to our investigation, our industry has been affected by the currency reform and has declined indescribably. If we add extra burdens, we will simply be waiting to die. This office, considering the suffering of our colleagues, should assume the responsibility of providing assistance and relief. Therefore, we are urgently inviting all colleagues in the French Concession to attend an emergency meeting at this office to jointly devise a good plan to achieve the purpose of saving ourselves and others. The meeting is scheduled for this month's 26th (i.e., Sunday) from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM. In addition to sending letters separately, we are sending this special letter to you, hoping that your esteemed company will investigate, quickly send a responsible representative to attend our office on time and discuss everything. It concerns our personal interests, so please do not disregard and be absent." The meeting location is the Punan Office of the Tobacco Exchange Industry, No. 427 Fumin Road, Dananmen.</p>

<p>Hua Cheng Cup Singles Final Today</p>
<p>Carlson vs. Fox starting at 4:30 PM</p>
<p>Student Group Final: Tang Baojia vs. Li Guofan</p>
<p>The semi-finals of the Hua Cheng Cup All-Shanghai Open Singles Tennis Tournament at the Kang Ti venue were held yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM. There were four players, with only Luo Min'e being Chinese. The results of the semi-finals were as follows: Carlson defeated Roberts in straight sets, and Kola defeated Luo Min'e 3-1. The student group also held semi-finals yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Li Guofan and Kang Jiade qualified for the final. The winners of both groups will hold semi-finals starting at 3:00 PM this afternoon. Tickets are half a yuan.</p>
<p>The techniques in both semi-finals of the student group were not satisfactory. Li Guofan's victory over Ye Baosheng can be said to be easy. Ye had many unforced errors and little control over his shots. Tang Baojia vs. Hu Xuguang was fiercely competitive and quite spectacular. Every point and every game was hard-fought. Tang won the first set 8-6. In the second set, Hu's strength waned, and he was helpless, losing 6-0 to Tang.</p>
<p>Starting at 4:30 PM was the open singles semi-final. Carlson is a champion in Shanghai, and Fox is also a veteran of many years, with added stability. Carlson's victory was expected, but the two were fiercely competitive. Carlson's sharp and decisive left and right shots were met by Fox's calm response and fierce returns, making the performance quite exciting. However, the situation was entirely controlled by Carlson, so he won in straight sets, losing only five games.</p>
<p>The other open semi-final was Kola vs. Luo Min'e, the only remaining Chinese player. The two had similar hitting styles, each using long baseline shots, and occasionally going to the net. Kola is a first-class player in Shanghai, known for his steady play, correct ball placement, and few errors. Luo tried his best, but was no match for him. Kola won the first two sets with two 6-2 victories. In the third set, Kola was ahead 5-3, but Luo Min'e suddenly rallied, using steady and fierce shots to make Kola tired, and won the set 8-6. In the fifth set, Luo Min'e was leading 3-1, but Kola won five consecutive games to end the match.</p>
<p>Results of Each Group</p>
<p>Today's Schedule</p>
<p>The three groups of doubles - the third week match between Honmura and Uchida against Hu Xuguang and Li Guofan, the second week match between Kola and Costan against Anderlu Suolobao, and the match between Fox and Mermen against Tang Baojia and Ye Baosheng - were originally scheduled to be held today, but have been changed to tomorrow (Monday) at 5:15 PM.

<p>Wang Zhengting Arrives in Berlin and Makes a Statement</p>
<p>National Maritime News Agency, Berlin, July 24 - Dr. Wang Zhengting, former Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs, arrived here from the United States today. Dr. Wang is the chief leader of the Chinese World Games athletes this time. He has spared no effort in promoting sports in China, and has made many contributions to the Far Eastern sports world. Chinese Ambassador Cheng Tianfang and the Chinese World Games delegation all arrived at the station to welcome Mr. and Mrs. Wang.</p>
<p>Dr. Wang told this agency's reporter that China's promotion of sports is still short-term. Compared with world heroes, it is naturally impossible to expect supreme performances and contributions from athletes produced during this short period. China's participation in this conference is more important than the results obtained. China must first learn to walk and then learn to run. The knowledge and skills brought back by the Chinese athletes participating in this conference will be the foundation for China's victory in the future.</p>

<p>*The Shanghai News Extra, Amateur Weekly - Overseas Postal Agency Taiwan People’s Life Survey*</p>
<p>Lin Wenhuan</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence</p>
<p>Even a person skilled in dialects rarely masters the Fujian dialects well. Although the commonly spoken Fujian dialect is broadly divided into only two types, namely Fuzhou dialect and Xiamen dialect, in southern Fujian, except for Xiamen dialect which is somewhat passable in a few large cities, almost every county, even every two towns, has its own dialect. However, the Taiwanese people from that foreign land all use the Xiamen dialect of southern Fujian. Because of the ease of communication, southern Fujian has become a gathering place and refuge for Taiwanese people.</p>
<p>Since Xiamen was opened as a commercial port, it has become the gateway to the Zhangjiang River in southern Fujian, and goods are gathered here. As a result, overseas Chinese gather, people from all directions mix, and the market flourishes daily. Everywhere, there is a custom that once a place becomes prosperous, gambling dens and brothels will emerge in response. This is also the case in Xiamen. The difference is that in Xiamen, the operation of these businesses seems to be monopolized by Taiwanese vagrants.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many Taiwanese people in Xiamen and Gulangyu who operate legitimate businesses, such as banks, hospitals, and hotels, but they are ultimately not as numerous as those engaged in gambling and other such businesses. In Xiamen city, there is a famous "Taiwanese Street," which is named similarly to the "Chinatowns" in various parts of America. According to local terminology, it is called "Ju Kou Street" (close to the newly opened Zhongshan Road). On the surface, no one can see that Ju Kou Street is a place for "hiding dirt and harboring filth." For example, a fine and beautifully decorated cafe may have a place upstairs for opium addicts to indulge. The simplicity and squalor in between are thought by many who have been to Shanghai to be no less than Shanghai's Swallow's Nest (a reference to opium dens). Sometimes, a magnificent mansion seems to be bustling with guests, but who knows that it is actually a gambling den doing thriving business. Those who are well-dressed and come from afar are nothing more than gamblers seeking the foul odor. Brothels do not openly solicit customers with signs. On the surface, almost all of them look like residential houses. But once night falls and the lights come on, singing and dancing are inevitable, and couples everywhere are a common sight.</p>
<p>That street, like Macau between southern China's Guangdong and Hong Kong, and Monte Carlo in Switzerland's World Park, is not restricted by any authorities or government orders, because the people who run these businesses are very respectable families. They can often stand on equal footing with people in officialdom. It is said that there are three famous Taiwanese clans in Xiamen: the Li clan, which is the most prominent of the three, with widespread influence and abundant capital; the Lin clan, which mainly operates dance halls and cafes, and cultivates relationships with officials and gentry, excelling in social skills and wielding great influence in southern Fujian; and the Gao clan, which is in a relatively weak position and cannot compare with the Li and Lin clans.</p>
<p>The above three clans actually hold the power of the trading center of Xiamen, especially recently. This is because the three clans are all local Taiwanese and also citizens under the protection of a strong country. The followers they gather are mostly fugitives from Taiwan who have fled to Xiamen, all of whom are capable and cunning, and experienced in navigating the world. In addition to engaging in business, they also provide various kinds of protection for others. For example, if someone needs to borrow a signboard to engage in "special trade," they only need to contact them, and they can often save a lot of expenses and get real protection. Therefore, their followers are increasing day by day.</p>
<p>There are even more vagrants among the Taiwanese, and their character is even lower than that of the people engaged in "special trade." Therefore, they do not hesitate to sell arms and aid bandits. It is said that a capable vagrant can buy enough quick-firing guns for a newly formed army in one day.</p>
<p>Some of the more noble Taiwanese women marry foreign businessmen or become their concubines. Those of middle rank, if they are kind, assist their husbands in running legitimate businesses; if they are cunning, they serve as assistants in "special trade." The lowest of them sell songs and engage in prostitution everywhere, without shame. Among them, there is also a kind of "female troupe street opera" that still retains the remnants of feudal society.</p>
<p>Every year in mid-July of the lunar calendar, during the so-called "Zhongyuan Festival," people in Xiamen, like elsewhere, are busy collecting money to hold a Taiping Gong Jiao (a religious ceremony). Paper money and paper clothes are hung everywhere in the streets, fluttering in the wind. At night, each household takes turns inviting "female troupes" to perform opera, sometimes all night long. The operas performed are mostly "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" and other stories popular among the Chinese people, but the performers are all Taiwanese women.</p>
<p>It seems to have become a habit. People in Xiamen often treat this "Taiwanese opera" as their local tune. Whether old or young, male or female, if they have nothing to do, they always hum this tune. Of course, most of these operas cannot escape the old Chinese plot of "miss gives gold in the back garden, and the fallen young master becomes the top scholar," but the people who sing these street operas are not the people of China. They have become the whipped subjects of a strong neighbor. Therefore, the sad and beautiful singing often makes people think of the Tang Dynasty poet's lines: "The merchant girl does not know the sorrow of a conquered nation, and still sings the 'Backyard Flower' across the river!"</p>
<p>The total number of Taiwanese living in Xiamen is about 50,000 to 60,000, and more are still entering this year. Because the reporter has many Taiwanese friends, I am often invited to Ju Kou Street to peek at the mysterious arrangements. Now, let's talk about gambling first.</p>
<p>Their gambling method can be described as unique, called "Twelve Varieties" gambling. The twelve varieties are: White King, White Minister, White Elephant, Black King, Black Minister, Black Elephant, White Chariot, White Horse, White Cannon, Black Chariot, Black Horse, Black Cannon, similar to the twelve symbols of chess pieces. The opening treasure place in the gambling den does not gather many gamblers. Only a few new entrants often go to see the lottery in person. The rest, those who want to gamble only need to know the names of the twelve varieties, stay at home, prepare the gambling capital, and wrap the amount of money they want to gamble in a paper package. The paper package also includes their guess of a certain variety (for example, if guessing Black Cannon, specify gambling three corners of money on Black Cannon). Naturally, a runner specially assigned by the gambling den will come to collect it (Editor's note: quite like the Shanghai flower meeting telephone form). If the lottery is Black Cannon, then the three corners of money paid for guessing Black Cannon wins the lottery, and you can get back three yuan and three corners. (Three yuan is the winning money, and three corners is the principal, seeing one paying ten). When drawing the lottery, the twelve varieties are also sealed and randomly drawn to be opened, and the lottery can be drawn in batches (for example, once the first batch of runners returns, the lottery is drawn once; then the second batch is drawn again). The runners can take money from both sides. For example, the runner receives money from the customer and delivers it to the gambling den, and can deduct one corner from each yuan as a fare reward. If you win the lottery, you can also ask the customer for a reward bonus of one corner per yuan. If the customer's gambling capital is large (assuming it is several hundred yuan) and wins several thousand yuan, then the hundreds of yuan of capital spent will all be given to the runner. At the same time, most of the runners are accomplices of the gambling den boss. When they find that many people are guessing a certain "variety", they will inform the boss to pay attention, and some gambling dens even cheat to harm customers.</p>
<p>But in Xiamen, "Twelve Varieties" gambling has become a major event in daily life. Almost every family has one or two people who are addicted to "Twelve Varieties" gambling as if their lives depended on it, and some even make a desperate bet, resulting in bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Not only people from Xiamen, but also many people from Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, and northern Fujian treat Ju Kou Street in Xiamen as a den of consumption, especially those from northern Fujian who specialize in becoming officials come the most. Although it is only a small place, the evils of the city are already very obvious.</p>
<p>Taiwanese brothels sometimes have close relationships with hotels and cafes. If you discuss it with the old waiter in the hotel, you can find your way; if there are female attendants in the cafe, then there is some meaning. Often, dance hall-style cafes also have brothel and hotel facilities; larger ones also have gambling den facilities (sometimes there are also Fan-Tan and Pai Gow games). As for the source of prostitutes, there are the following types:</p>
<p>1.  Adopted daughters: The nature of adopted daughters is no different from keeping maids. When they are young, they specialize in doing chores and are slaves in the family. When they reach the age of twelve or thirteen, their treatment is divided according to their beauty. The beautiful ones become money trees for the brothel, and the rest are either sold to other places or transferred to female opera troupes, etc., and some are maids in the brothel for life. However, when the madam starts buying adopted daughters, they are mostly around ten years old, and their appearance will not change too much, so there are very few ugly ones.</p>
<p>2.  Those who are lured and abducted: There are also women who are lured into brothels through tricks. Many are abducted and sold into brothels. Most of those who are older belong to this category.</p>
<p>3.  Those who are pawned: There are also those whose parents or daughters-in-law, or wives with husbands, pawned into the brothel as prostitutes due to economic difficulties, mostly with a pawn period of three to five years. Pawning is like selling, but they can be redeemed when they have money. Because people can generate profits, no interest is charged on the money obtained from pawning.</p>
<p>Most of the female actors in female opera troupes are pawned.</p>
<p>Opium is entirely smuggled. It is said that in addition to importing from southwest Fujian, some are also brought in by sea ships. Most of the opium den bosses are Taiwanese, or they have to borrow a signboard. The locations are mostly upstairs in cafes; some are in hotels; some are in gambling dens. Gamblers in gambling dens can smoke for free (including opium, cigars, cigarettes, etc.).</p>
<p>Ju Kou Street is not only a gathering place for dismissed dignitaries from Fujian Province, but also inevitably a place for bandits to relax. Fujian Province is famous for its people's army; but the so-called people's army, if not recruited by the central government, is of course still bandits. Therefore, Ju Kou Street is not only a refuge for Taiwanese fugitives, but also a refuge for Fujianese fugitives.</p>
<p>There are also many tragic killings in Ju Kou Street, and the expansion and disappearance of events are often unexpected. If we want to describe Ju Kou Street, we can call it one of the "special zones."</p>
<p>However, the upper and lower classes of Xiamen city secretly regard Ju Kou Street as the trend, influencing them. If we think about the local community, we will feel that it is a fire-breathing mouth that destroys Xiamen.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Book Review: Zhang Yihong's "Introduction to Philosophy" <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Liangfu</p>
<p>(This book was recently published by Xin Ken Bookstore, priced at 9 corners)</p>
<p>There are many books on the introduction to philosophy that can be found in bookstores. Some are written by themselves, some are translated from Western Europe, and some are compiled based on other people's books. However, generally speaking, they are all inherited and transcribed, a set of old philosophical systems, without new opinions. After reading this kind of introduction to philosophy, we feel as if they are all the same, without any new content. Originally, this kind of introductory book on philosophy did not give us specific content of the current new philosophy, nor did it use advanced new philosophical research methods, but only talked about ontology, cosmology, and philosophy of life, etc., the empty framework of decadent and dead philosophy, listing some opinions from old philosophical schools such as monotheism, polytheism, dogmatism, and skepticism. It does not stand on the standpoint of new philosophy and specifically grasp the content of the living philosophy of the present.</p>
<p>Recently, a book "Introduction to Philosophy" by Zhang Yihong was published. In recent years, no one has written books on the introduction to philosophy. Perhaps people who study philosophy, in the old aspects, feel that the previous philosophical system is enough, and there is no need to establish another one; in the new aspects, they either feel the difficulty of changing the strings and becoming a unique style, or they think that the new philosophy outlines discussed by the predecessors are complete, and there is no need to follow the same pattern. Therefore, Zhang Yihong's "Introduction to Philosophy" is now considered to have broken this silence of many years.</p>
<p>Naturally, this "Introduction to Philosophy" also has its own unique features. For example, many other books only discuss the opinions of various schools in the idealism school, such as monotheism, polytheism, etc., and never mention materialism, let alone dialectical materialism. This shows that they are completely old philosophical introductions to philosophy, idealistic introductions to philosophy, and introductions to philosophy of the past. It is by no means a truly current introduction to philosophy.</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>Page 20</p>
<p>Now in our book, although the system also inherits the arrangement of the old introduction to philosophy, after all, at the end of each chapter or section, when describing the opinions of various schools, it also puts forward the emerging materialism, and does not let the philosophical opinions of idealism completely occupy the entire field of the introduction to philosophy, but also raises the new materialism to compete with idealism, sharing the world equally. This point is what makes this book different from other introductions to philosophy, and also shows the author's attention to dialectical materialism or bias towards dialectical materialism.</p>
<p>However, we think that this is still not enough. According to the consistent method of this book, in discussing each opinion, it only describes the statements of various schools, and then uses dialectical materialism to unify it. It seems that all opinions have their own merits, and should be permanently preserved, encompassing all, and stored in new materialism. Moreover, in many places, it does not express its own opinions at all, but only, like old philosophers, completely lists and elaborates the opinions of various schools, providing some materials, without making choices and criticisms. Based on these, we know that the author's standpoint is only intentionally or unintentionally and unconsciously aware of dialectical materialism, and has not resolutely stood on the standpoint of new materialism to criticize all the opinions of the previous old philosophy. He only wants to unify, compromise, and reconcile: he ignores overcoming and negating.</p>
<p>Another thing is about the style. Naturally, the form is determined by the content. Because this book cannot completely escape the system of the old introduction to philosophy, it still divides the connotation of philosophy into several departments: epistemology, cosmology, ontology, and philosophy of life. Although the author said in this book, "Ontology and cosmology are unified in natural philosophy," "Called natural philosophy, it is equivalent to natural science," and "Philosophy of life (philosophy of life—author's note) is the content of social science," but despite saying this, the system of this introduction to philosophy still lists ontology, cosmology, and philosophy of life. I think the author of this book has also read Engels's works, right? Didn't Engels clearly say: "After understanding the achievements of the development of philosophy for two thousand five hundred years, natural science, on the one hand, can break away from special natural philosophy, stand apart from it, and above it..." He also said: "Because of the great progress of natural philosophy,... we can use the materials provided by empirical natural science itself to create a chart of the interconnections of all natural phenomena. ...Now people only need to observe the results obtained by studying nature with the dialectical method, that is, the results obtained by studying the interconnections between various natural processes, and they can get a natural system that is enough for the present era,... so natural philosophy is also definitely eliminated." So natural philosophy "equivalent to natural science", that is, what Mr. Zhang called ontology and cosmology, "is also definitely eliminated." Engels also said: "This historical view (materialist historical view) resulted in the philosophy of the entire history, just as the dialectical view of nature made all philosophy of nature useless and impossible." Then, is there still room for the philosophy of life, which is "the content of social science"? Therefore, "after philosophy is driven out of nature and history, only one area is left for it to hide. This area is pure thought: the study of the laws of thought—logic and dialectics." And dialectics is the general law of the movement of nature, society, and thinking, so the task of philosophy now is to study this point. The specific content is dialectical materialism and the dialectics of materialism. What ontology, cosmology, and philosophy of life are all the content of the old philosophical introduction to philosophy. This is what the author of this book does not understand, and it is also the place where it falls into the same old rut as the old philosophy.</p>
<p>However, although the author still raises the philosophy of life and natural philosophy in the old philosophy above the introduction to philosophy, when he talks about the direction of philosophy, he concludes that the elimination of philosophy is the same as many people who advocate the elimination of philosophy before and now. If you understand what the previous philosophies were, and understand what the content of the current philosophy is, then I think you will know that new philosophy has its own special area, which is the study of "logic and dialectics." Perhaps this point is also Mr. Zhang's overcorrection? Engels only said that the former natural philosophy and historical philosophy "have been eliminated", and "classical philosophy" has reached "the end", and never said that new philosophy, "logic and dialectics" has reached the end. When Mr. Zhang wants to elaborate on the content of philosophy, he does not hesitate to pull in the natural philosophy and philosophy of life that have been eliminated from classical philosophy. When he wants to negate philosophy, he even drives out the logic and dialectics that "leave one place for it to hide", then why did Mr. Zhang have to do this introduction to philosophy? According to the former, there is already an old introduction to philosophy, why make another one? According to the latter, there is no philosophy, where does the introduction to philosophy come from?</p>
<p>The above are just two main opinions that I disagree with about this book, which are also two important points in this book. As for other details, there are many things worth discussing, but I can't say more here. However, compared with the general introduction to philosophy in bookstores, this book is more neat and popular for general readers; its arrangement is clear, and the distribution is even, which are its merits. Moreover, it also slightly points out some new philosophy and has the intention of guiding readers to be biased towards it, which can be regarded as the most characteristic place of this book.</p>

<p>He Rongzong</p>
<p>Istanbul Correspondence</p>
<p>Istanbul, formerly known as Constantinople, is the old capital of Turkey. It faces Scutari across the famous Bosphorus Strait. Because this strait is the throat of the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, and the main transportation route between Europe and Asia, Istanbul and Scutari are very important in terms of terrain. After the war, the Lausanne Treaty stipulated that the Bosphorus Strait and the Dardanelles Strait should be demilitarized and the straits should be managed by a special international committee. The Montreux Conference, which has recently attracted the attention of people all over the world, discussed Turkey's request to fortify the straits. At present, the Turkish people here are eagerly hoping that the straits will be fortified, their rights will be recovered, and the old appearance of Istanbul and the Bosphorus Strait will be restored.</p>
<p>But what is the general situation of Istanbul?</p>
<p>Seen from a sea ship, Istanbul is very beautiful and magnificent; especially at night, under the illumination of brilliant electric lights on layers of modern buildings, it looks a bit like Hong Kong. But when you land and walk into this city, everything will make you feel disappointed. Many of the streets here are very narrow and unclean, almost completely different from modern big cities; in the hotel, especially in summer, the first to get close to you are bedbugs and fleas, making you unable to sleep all night.</p>
<p>Most people here have a strange superstition, that is, they believe that dogs and many animals are servants of God, and they must be well raised, otherwise they will be punished by God. It is said that there were very many dogs here for a period of time, until after the outbreak of the war, the British army captured hundreds of thousands of dogs and exiled them to a lonely island in Marmara; this island was later called Big Island. Now there are indeed very few dogs here, but there are very many cats, and you can hear the sound of meowing almost everywhere, and you can smell the stench of cat feces everywhere; this may be because cats have not encountered a large-scale investigation that catches them all in one go.</p>
<p>However, Istanbul also has many places of interest to visit, such as the old palace, especially the great treasury in the middle, which is rare to see elsewhere. This place was closed in the past, and no one could go in to see it without the permission of the Turkish emperor. From the last Turkish emperor, Muhammad V, to the current president, Kemal, I don't know how many twists and turns it has gone through, and it has finally been fully opened now, and even foreigners can go in to visit at will.</p>
<p>In the great treasury of the palace, which is most noticeable to tourists, there are many rare and precious treasures. The first thing that can make anyone shrink back is the throne of the Persian emperor. It is said that this throne was built in 1501, when the Persian emperor Ismail I was in power. It is made of gold, its four feet are inlaid with countless pearls and gemstones of the same color, and it is covered with a huge crystal cover; it looks magnificent and dazzling, like a treasure mountain. In addition, there is a similar throne, also made of gold, also inlaid with many diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls and other treasures. But this throne is not covered with a crystal cover, but a round gold cover, on which is also hung a gold lock inlaid with emeralds, its size is a bit surprising, its end alone is six inches long and two inches thick, and on it is engraved with Islamic scripture verses.</p>
<p>When we stare at these two thrones, we always want to reach out and touch them, we always want to move them to ourselves; sometimes we even can't help but want to sit on them and taste what it is like to sit on them. Really, when you see such precious thrones, you will have the fantasy of being an emperor; who doesn't want to be an emperor? If possible.</p>
<p>Next to those two thrones, there is a crystal cabinet, in which are not other items, but three huge emeralds and many treasures. In addition, there are also displayed many gold-made and gem-inlaid scabbards, as well as countless armors, daggers, swords, etc., their light is dazzling and frightening.</p>
<p>But what is said above is only the situation of the first room of the treasury, in addition, there is a second room, also called the treasure room. There are twelve crystal tanks in the room, all seven or eight inches high; all of them are filled with diamonds, pearls, emeralds, rubies, sapphires and other treasures. In addition, there are also several large stones, with delicate jade carvings of various patterns or animal shapes; because the light is flashing, it looks like several giant beasts are turning their eyes there. However, I think the most valuable thing here is still the many clocks and watches since the sixteenth century, which can let people see the various stages that the development of modern civilization has gone through; moreover, among the countless clocks and watches, there is a clock inherited from 1740, which makes twenty-four different sounds a day to report the time to people; this is not only a treasure, but also the most valuable thing in science and culture.</p>
<p>In short, there are many precious items in the palace treasury, and it is impossible to say them all at once; if you want to come to Istanbul, I hope you will visit this place first.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Book Review: Introduction to "Literary Circles" <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>

<p>Recently, the number of literary magazines that have appeared in China is probably more than any period since the New Literature Movement. This is something that every literature lover can feel. What we are going to introduce now is the "Literary Circles" which is worthy of attention among the many newly appeared literary magazines, hoping that this will enable readers to have a general understanding of the recent Chinese literary world.</p>
<p>One of the newest issues currently being raised by the Chinese literary world is the "National Defense Literature" issue that everyone is already familiar with. "Literary Circles" is discussing and practicing this issue with the most space. For example, He Jiahua's "My Views on the United Problem of the Literary and Art Circles," Zhou Yang's "On National Defense Literature," Zhou Muzhai's "Water Margin and National Defense Literature" in the inaugural issue, and Guo Moruo's "National Defense, Dirty Pool, Purgatory," Ai Siqi's "New Situation and Literary Tasks, Lu Xun's "On Our Current Literary Movement," Mao Dun's "On Our Current Literary Movement," Huang Feng's "National Defense Literature in the Soviet Union" and other papers in the second issue are all establishing and developing the theory of national defense literature. In terms of creation, the ideological content of most works can be said to be the consciousness of national defense literature. In this way, if you want to ask about the characteristics of "Literary Circles", the first is the promotion and establishment of national defense literature.</p>
<p>Among those papers discussing national defense literature, there are three that are worth mentioning in particular: the first is Zhou Yang's "On National Defense Literature," which has a clear criticism of the opinions of opponents of national defense literature; the second is Ai Siqi's "New Situation and Literary Tasks," in which the author points out the characteristics of the current labor situation and clarifies the significance and tasks of national defense literature based on this; the third is Guo Moruo's "National Defense, Dirty Pool, Purgatory," I think this is the best and clearest article explaining literature since the slogan "National Defense Literature" was put forward—the author, in addition to giving a general explanation of national defense literature here, also gave a correct explanation of "patriotism": on the one hand, he exposed the true colors of the "dirty pool" style "patriots" who "collude with national traitors internally" and "flatter strong powers externally" and the Goujianists who "sleep on steel wire beds" and "taste dragon liver and phoenix gall", on the other hand, he also pointed out without any ambiguity: "In the current China, only progressive realists are true patriots, and the road taken by those who truly have patriotic enthusiasm is also the road of progressive realism." In this way, aren't all aspects of the problem clearly revealed?</p>
<p>As for the creation of national defense literature, there are Mu Ge's "One Day in a Certain School," Shu Qun's "Sparks in the Desert" and "Xiao Ling," Xu Maoyong's Flame... and so on. Among them, I think Shu Qun's two are particularly worthy of evaluation. It is said that the author is from the Northeast, and the pain of national subjugation has already been actually suffered, so his works can very naturally reveal the enthusiasm for resisting the enemy. The subjects of "Sparks in the Sand" and "Xiao Ling" are also the tragic events of national subjugation suffered by the people in the Northeast and other places, which the author has personally experienced. The anti-enemy thoughts and enthusiasm expressed by this are also very real, completely different from those anti-imperialist literatures that are fantasized sitting at home. After reading these two works, what we feel is that there are no bizarre places in the development of the story, and the appearance of all events is very natural, but in this process, the enemy's tyranny, the shamelessness of the traitors, and the heroic resistance enthusiasm of the true patriots are vividly presented one by one. Although the words and sentences used by the author are very simple, and there are no particularly sensational slogans, after reading it, it can make you moved, excited, and ignite the same anti-resistance enthusiasm. For example, for the satire and condemnation of the "studying to save the country" doctrine, some works in the past have also expressed this point, but those expressions mostly rely on fierce words and theoretical preaching, or fictional stories, while Shu Qun's expression of "Xiao Ling" is due to the natural development of events. The work also tells us that when the enemy soldiers have not yet reached her, a training instructor, Zhang, is talking about "studying to save the country", but when the enemy soldiers have already arrived, she told the school servant to burn the national flag quickly, and a truly patriotic female student said coldly: "Why don't you say 'studying to save the country' now?"" How concise and powerful this is! Naturally, these two creations also have some shortcomings, such as the oversimplified description in many places, and the fast pace, making people feel that the author's expressive power is not enough, but in the end, the author can still be said to be one of the most promising new writers.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, there are two creations in "Literary Circles" that are worth reading, namely Sha Ting's "In the Ancestral Hall" and Guo Moruo's "Sima Qian's Determination", especially the latter. This should be a historical novel, which the author uses to satirize and mock the general powers by telling the story of Sima Qian's efforts to write the Historical Records after his testicles were cut off. Through Sima Qian's mouth, after telling the story of Qin Shihuang currying favor with the wealthy Wu Shi Luo and Ba widow, he said: "Setting fire to books, kowtowing to cattle and sheep, urinating and defecating on the heads of scholars, offering jade belts to wealthy widows, this is power!... If a literary scholar had rich men like Wu Shi Luo and Ba widow, power would voluntarily cut off their testicles to serve literature. How could literature be allowed to be cut off from its testicles to serve power?" I think that even the current Han Wudi and Ren Shaoqing and his like would blush at this merciless mockery. The author is very good at creating historical stories, such as the past "Three Rebellious Women", etc., which are quite famous. Here we can also introduce the author's historical novel, which can also be said to be a historical sketch, namely "Essays" in the fourth issue, "Qin Shihuang is About to Die", which is written better, more vividly, and has more realistic significance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the theoretical introduction of reportage literature, there are two articles in the inaugural issue of "Literary Circles": Plere Merin's "On Reportage Literature" (translated by Xu Maoyong) and Andre Marlux's "The Necessity of Reportage Literature" (translated by Shen Qiyu). The former points out that the method of expressing objective truth in reportage literature is the easiest, most direct, and fastest, and explains the dialectical path of writing reportage literature: "that is, from practical observation to abstract thought, and then to the objective reality of experimentation"; thus it theoretically expresses the positive significance and tasks of reportage literature. In this</p>
<p>Below connects to page 5</p>
<p>Page 21</p>
<p>Page 22</p>
<p>Page 23</p>
<p>In the middle, there are brief criticisms of reportage writers from Balzac, Zola to Sinclair, and Kisch. As for the latter, namely "The Necessity of Reportage Literature", it theoretically and practically proves the existence significance and active role of reportage literature. At the same time, "Literary Circles" also published Kisch's reportage work: "Secret China" (translated by Li Bo). This author is a so-called "fast-paced reportage writer", and his reportage works are considered to be the best in the world today. "Secret China" here is a collection of many reportage works describing the social phenomena of Chinese reality, and three articles have been published so far: "Soldier Mudi's Yoshiwara", "Sludge" (inaugural issue) and "Child Labor in Cotton Mills" (second issue). It is said that they will be published one after another in the future: this can not only enable us to actually understand the characteristics of the creative form of reportage literature, but also enable us to truly know many "secrets" of Chinese society.</p>
<p>Finally, what needs to be said is the "Creation Monthly Review" and the "Symposium", which can also be said to be a characteristic of "Literary Circles". I would say that in recent China, criticism and creation have been separated, because critics do not pay much attention to the newly produced creations of reality, they like to talk about Homer, Dante, Goethe, Byron; at the same time, writers also feel that this criticism has no direct relationship with them, and therefore do not want to pay attention to criticism; the so-called development of criticism and creation can be said to be not together. Now that "Literary Circles" has the establishment of a "Creation Monthly Review", there should be a considerable remedy for this shortcoming, and it is hoped that the magazine will continue to work hard in the future until the shortcoming is completely overcome. Naturally, this work is a bit thankless, but its significance is very significant: it can revitalize criticism and help creation. As for Mei Yu's several short reviews in the inaugural issue, although they are too simple and insufficient, the author can be admired for starting to try this work in the current China without fear of difficulties. Secondly, the establishment of a symposium on commenting on creation has the same important significance as the "Creation Monthly Review". The "Sai Jinhua Symposium" (sponsored by the Playwrights Association) published in the inaugural issue can be said to be very appropriate in most of its criticisms of the play "Sai Jinhua"; among them, Ling He's opinion is particularly worthy of attention. We hope that there will be more similar symposiums in the future, preferably one every issue, to collectively evaluate newly created literary and artistic works and even newly emerging writers.</p>

<p>Han Juemin, 39 years old, from Hubei, residing at No. 23 Dongchang Inn on Avenue Joffre (present-day Huaihai Road) in the French Concession, the principal of Pudong Middle School, recently engaged lawyer Lin Qingchi to file a complaint with the local court accusing students Wang Jiayou, Zhang Yuansong, Gong Panlong, Gong Baoren, Hu Yongcheng, Zhang Bingchi, Yuan Ziqiang, Li Wenyu, and others of defamation and damage. The complaint stated that the defendants were students who had previously been ordered to withdraw from the school. On the 27th of last month, around 7 PM, they gathered more than 30 ruffians and suddenly came to the school auditorium for a secret meeting, the content of which was unknown. Afterwards, they posted declarations and slogans, damaging the reputation of the principal. At the same time, they organized a disciplinary team, vandalized various offices in the school, occupied the school building, and used violence to prevent staff members from working and moving freely. The defendants openly assembled a crowd to carry out violent coercion, disrupting the school's administration, committing the crime of disturbing order under Article 150 of the Criminal Law. They also intruded into the school without reason, using violence to obstruct school staff from exercising their duties, committing the crime of obstructing freedom under Articles 304 and 306 of the Criminal Law. They also spread declarations and posted slogans, falsely damaging the principal's reputation, committing the crime of defamation under Article 310, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Furthermore, they destroyed and damaged the office and the miscellaneous items inside, committing the crime of destroying and damaging property under Article 354 of the Criminal Law, and so on. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Deying opened the court for trial. The plaintiff did not appear. On the defendant's side, Zhang Yuansong, Wang Jiayou, and Xi Baoren were present. All three denied the accusations, claiming that the principal had fabricated the charges due to a long-standing disagreement. The court adjourned the case for further questioning after summoning witnesses.</p>

<p>Zhu Tongsheng, from Changshu, operates the Yu Kang and Ning Yuan cigarette and paper shops at No. 955 and No. 937 on The Bund. One morning recently, at about 7 AM, a man resembling a service worker on a ship suddenly appeared at the old shop, Yu Kang, holding 95 ten-cent nickel coins and 5 twenty-cent nickel coins, and asked apprentice Zhu Hengfu to exchange them for banknotes. Weng, unsure of the authenticity of these nickel coins, asked the man to wait for a moment and took them to the new shop, Ning Yuan. There, partner Weng Fuliang examined them and found that the ten-cent nickel coins were completely counterfeit, while the twenty-cent coins were genuine. He quickly returned, but the man had already fled without a trace. He stored the nickel coins and later handed them over to the owner, Zhu Tongsheng. At 10:20 AM, Zhou Enxiang (40 years old) from Tianjin arrived and took out 80 similar ten-cent nickel coins, 5 genuine twenty-cent coins, and 1 genuine five-cent coin from his pocket. He told the apprentice Zhu Hengfu, "Please take a look at these nickel coins and see if they can be used," trying to take advantage of his youth. The apprentice Zhu knew that he was an accomplice of the first man and reported it. Chinese detective Zhao Yongqing and Chinese constable No. 1863 arrested him and took him along with the nickel coins abandoned by the first man to the Wayside Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Municipal Council lawyer Zhang Shizhu presented the case, stating that the defendant claimed at the police station that he had arrived in Shanghai from Yantai on the Lishun ship, selling candy, and obtained these nickel coins. His testimony was very evasive, and he requested a postponement for further investigation. He presented the nickel coins for inspection. Subsequently, apprentice Zhu Hengfu, owner Zhu Tongsheng, and partner Weng Fuliang testified to the events. When questioned, the defendant's statement was the same as the one he gave at the police station. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered that he be remanded in custody for further investigation at a later date.</p>
