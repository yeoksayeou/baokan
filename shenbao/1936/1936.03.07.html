<p>— 朗</p>
<p>舉世矚目的英國國防計劃白皮書已於三日發表文長萬餘言首述最近國際形勢的緊張與各國競相擴充軍備的情形繼卽說明英國於最近一年間之增加軍備充實國防的計劃其要點爲一九三七年建造主力艦二艘巡洋艦及其他補助艦多艘擴張艦隊中之空軍設備增加海軍將士六千人步兵四營整頓現有陸軍之編制添編皇家空軍新輔助隊四隊增置第一道防綫之空軍飛機至一千七百五十架擴充或倍增政府軍火製造廠這個防軍擴充計劃的巨大是近年英國國防史上所少見的可是極端的保守派還以爲不足表示不滿惟反對派的工黨與愛好和平的民衆却大不贊成在下星期的議會中必將有劇烈的辯論而在國際上英國的國防計劃允將引起重大的影饗</p>
<p>擴充軍備準備第二决世界大屠殺本是英國保守黨政府的一貫政策自去年東菲戰事發生後英國因有切身利害關係更戚到擴充軍備的迫切需要去冬舉行總選舉時保守黨卽以擴張軍備充實國防爲其競選的重要政策不過爲迎合愛好和平的民衆之心理起見却推說擴充軍備的目的在於鞏固集體安全制度的勢力因爲英國大多數人民是極企望和平擁護集體安全制度而不願戰爭的這可以拿去年和平投票事伴來證明保守黨政府有鑒於此就到處表示其擁護集體安全區的態度不過在他們看來要增厚集體安全制的勢力非有充實的武力不可而英國的現有國防力與其他各國比起來顯然非常薄弱所以應趕卽擴充軍備保守黨要人到處玩着這套魔術很能欺騙一般淺見的民衆例如最近（二月二十四日）外相艾登在議會中所發的重要外交演說從表面上看去好像英國的外交政第是極端擁護集體安全制的可是我們若加以澈底的分析却全在替英國擴充軍備辯護艾登的結論說「今因各國之好意殊乏信任而恐怖復四面襲來吾人實不得不重整軍備逐漸增固集體安全制實力消除無端侵略的恐怖之唯一途徑必俟各國皆知無論如何侵略行爲得不償失而後已」艾登的招供不是很明顯的嗎要是英國眞有擁護集體安全制的决心那末它爲什麽不積極參加歐洲區域互助公的以愛好和平國家之集體的武力去制裁侵略者所以英國的所謂擁護集體安全制不過是擴充軍備的藉口而這軍備擴充的目的不在於增厚集體安全的勢力而在於擴充大英帝國的武力以保護其遍布於全世界的殖民地利益並準備參加第二决的世界大屠殺罷了</p>
<p>我們以前常常聽到各國的政治家說要保障國家的安全非裁减軍備不可而現在大英帝國主義的代言人却要以擴充軍備來鞏固集體安全了擴充軍備果能鞏固集體安全嗎這是誰也不會相信的擴充軍備的結果祇有刺激戰爭的早日爆發我們當還記得去年英國發表國防白皮書後德國就藉口撕破凡爾賽和的而重整軍備今年英國大增軍備後各國又必將繼之而擴充軍備軍備競賽的結果戰爭的危機自然更加迫近集體安全制還有成功的希望嗎</p>

<p>一九三六年空軍預算今晨發表、計其經費共爲四三·四九〇·六〇〇鎊，比一九三五年原有預算多一九·六三九·五〇〇鎊、比最後預算亦增一二·四八八·五〇〇鎊、據政府說帖、空軍擴張計畫在一九三六年會計年度末期大致可望完成、故有增多經費之必要、合計海陸空三軍一九三六年預算經費增多二六·五四四·五〇〇鎊、今年空軍預算規定俸給六·五一八·〇〇〇鎊、比去年增一·五一六·〇〇〇鎊、試騐與研究等技術經費爲一八·四九一·〇〇〇鎊、比去年增八·三三九·〇〇〇鎊、民事航空經費爲七六〇·〇〇〇鎊、亦較去年增一六四·五〇〇鎊、空軍擴張計畫始于去年、在一九三七年三月底英京空軍力量將增多七十一隊而爲一百二十三隊、此外擬增置新輔助隊四隊、而現與陸軍合作之常備隊五隊、將改編爲七隊、於是國內共可有空軍一百二十九隊、其中二十隊爲後備性質、計其第一防錢飛機的共有一七五〇架、（六日路透電）</p>

<p>「國家之安全與世界之和平、不能依賴軍備而得之、唯堅决進行國際諒解之政策、遵守國聯盟的之條文實行軍縮、逐漸改善國際勞工之標準、與謀取經濟之合作、方可消釋戰爭原因、故本院不能贊同事實上僅從國家軍備方面覓取安全、以致加緊國家間武裝競爭終必釀成戰禍之政策、</p>
<p>「本院對於在戰事根據上改組工業之提議、頗爲惶駭、此舉將大增軍火製造業中固有之利益、並將造成不利於有組織的勞工與工會標準之重大危害、本院對於閣員未有信任、因其無價値而抱野心的外交政策、頗助成目前世界不寗之狀態也」、</p>
<p>預料此案辯論將延長二日之久、政府黨因事關重要、將照向例發出緊急通吿、分致擁護政府之議員、囑其於星期二日一律出席、盡力設法務使此案獲有大多數同意、（五日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　關於國防計劃之白皮書發表之後、反對派自由黨各議員决於下議院下星期一日討論此項問題時、提出動議案、表示反對意見、其內容如下、</p>
<p>再度聲明贊成集體安全制度、　政府所提國防計劃、幷未包括一種方案、可使英國依據集體安全制度精神、而與他國互相諮詢擴充軍備程序幷定一比率、實堪扼腕、　政府幷未努力防止軍備競爭之危險、　白皮書幷未載有擴充軍備所需欵項之數字、</p>
<p>又上項動議案提出時、當由該黨議員前蘇格蘭事務大臣辛克萊補充說明、該黨黨魁路易喬治大的亦當發言、至政府方面聞將由首相鮑爾溫。樞密大臣麥唐納。內相西門·財相張伯倫相繼答辯、工黨方面則黨魁阿德里·總工會派頒袖克林伍德，前運輸大臣現任倫敦市議員瑪里遜。前外决該黨執行委員達爾頓均將分別發言、申述反對意見、（六日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>— 趙君豪</p>
<p>（本報記者旅行通信）　自漢口到長沙</p>
<p>吉和輪於二日晨八時卽抵漢口，先赴中國旅行社江邊招待所稍憇。漢口天氣酷寒，冷風刺骨。十時許，由粵漢路株韶段武昌運輸所胡選堂君招待赴武昌，乘湖北建設廳輪渡過江，自漢陽門上岸，卽登黃鶴樓眺覽。黃鶴樓已非故物，係新建之高聳洋樓一所，所謂昔日之黃鶴樓者，僅於照相館橱牕中一窺其陳跡而己。自黃鶴樓遠望，漢口漢陽，歷歷在目，而長江中風帆上下，氣勢異常雄偉，武漢三鎭之險要，不難於黃鶴樓頭見之。游畢，卽乘人力車沿江岸赴徐家棚，徐家棚者，粵漢路武長段（卽湘鄂路）之起點站也，株韶段之材料運輸所，亦設於是。余始意湘鄂路規模初不甚宏，豈知身臨其地，則湘鄂路管理局之範圍，並不在津浦平漢之下，各種設備，應有盡有，辦公房屋與員工住宅，允鱗决櫛比，不下數十宅之多。但此路車輛之壞，行車之巔簸，在國內各路，恐無出其右者，抑亦異矣。余等以赴長沙之車，須於夜間八時半開行，枯守徐家棚，亦無濟於事，乃復渡江至漢口，作半日留連。漢口街衢整潔，法租界房屋，允稱美觀，惟市面甚屬蕭條，居民購買力，極爲薄弱，卽素以「聲光並佳譽滿武漢三鎭」之中央大戲院，亦寥落萬狀，余等往觀馬克斯兄弟主演之「明月照三星」，僅有觀客十餘人，偌大戲院，如此好片，而營業不振，至於如斯，卽此一端，可槪其餘矣。</p>
<p>晚六時，乘粵漢路渡輪過江，返武昌徐家棚的十分鐘卽達。粵漢路全綫通車時，徐家棚地方，必更形重要，將來與長江各輸辦理聯運，旅客貨物，如先至漢口，再渡江來此，必多週折，鄙意應在徐家棚加緊設置碼頭，以應需要，如是則上海開漢各輪，先灣徐家棚，再至漢口，方爲妥善，國營招商局，允宜亟起圖之。余等旣至徐家棚，卽登湘鄂路開長沙之車。徐家棚車站甚小，以滬杭甬路徐家匯站比較，猶有弗如，站上雖有電燈，但慘淡無光，情狀蕭瑟。是夕僅有頭等室三間，每室備舖位四只，故挈女眷同行者，大費躊躇；如同時有頭等客多人，必須男女同室，極爲不便，余等在上海享受預定舖位之偵利，在此打破無餘。頭等室中電燈亦甚昏暗，且無被褥，必須向茶房出錢租貨，州　前三日自滬至京，車上燈火輝煌，毛氈潔白如雪，兩兩相較，實有霄壤之別，余並非以享樂爲目的，實以旅客出相當之車價，應受相當之待遇也。自武昌至長沙，僅三百六十五公里，頭等票價，售十四元餘。八時半車行，震撼之劇烈，令人心房都碎，旅客在車廂中，如小兒之睡搖籃，其震動之程度，可使身體每一部份，均受其影響。是夜，余臥車中，昏昏沉沉，似睡非睡；痛苦情形，筆難罄述。决晨，天甫黎明，卽披衣起坐，强自鎭定，看車外景色，以祈求長沙之終於到達而己。余嘗研究湘鄂路所以敗壞至此，亦有其原因，蓋以自鄂至湘，原有水路，時間亦不甚長，湘鄂往來者，均謀節省金錢，乘坐小輪，旣經濟，又舒適，故鐵路營業，因之不振，收入旣少，養路費用，自然無着，於是枕木糜爛，無從更換，車輛破舊，無從購置，一任其陷於萬刦不復之境矣。現粵漢全路，通車在卽，湘鄂路當局以全路一通，於本路至有希望，亦在力謀整理之中，果能澈底改革，則後之經行該路者，可免坐搖籃之苦乎！</p>
<p>自鄂至湘，中途最大之站爲岳州，惜於昏夜中馳過，未能一見洞庭爲憾。早晨過汨羅站，得睹澄潔之汨羅江，水淺沙明，景色絕麗。自汨羅以下，天已大明，兩旁風物，盡收眼底。湘省之田，都作梯形，水深土厚，肥沃可知，老樹連山，籬落相間，大有水田漠漠，陰陰夏木之槪。沿途所見之山，多作赭紅色，山盡必爲大平原，蓋湘省完全屬於盆地也。十時四十分抵長沙，承株韶段株州材料廠仲廠長樹聲，武昌運輸所王主任寅淸，中國旅行社吳堯叔君到站相接。長沙市面之佳，秩序之好，殊出人意料。街衢多鋪大石板，整齊爲蘇州杭州所不及。繁盛之區，商舖規模，幾與上海相埒。長沙亦厲行新生活運動，路上隨時可見「行人靠左邊走謹守秩序」之磁牌，余細加視察，果見街上行人，去者循左，來者循右，絲毫不苟，余偶不注意，在途中吸姻，亦爲警察勸阻。長沙有一特異之現象，卽無論何處，可以見到靑年之兵士，亦不知其屬於何部隊，此種情形，似為他處所無。市中出售湘繡，到處可得，惟價均昂貴，且又非精品。余等跨水陸洲（如西湖中之湖心亭）兩渡湘江，至嶽麓山游覽。山下嶽麓書院，爲朱子講學四大書院之一，卽今之湖南大學，規模宏偉，環境幽雅，誠治學良所也。校門外懸有對聯，爲「惟楚有材」，「于斯爲盛」八字。自嶽麓山頂，俯瞰長沙，一覽無餘，湘江映帶，帆影往還，允極壯觀。是夕余等宿於長沙，將於明日（四日）赴株州淥口。（三月三日自長沙寄）</p>

<p>申時社云、暹羅商務專使奧撤他拿大氏、自星期二（三日）來華後、卽晋京謁見我外交鐵道等當局、商洽增進中暹貿易事宜、並擬在滬設立商務專署、以溝通中暹商情、公畢後、當予三日晚返滬、定本月十日乘輪赴港返暹、然後再于五六月間首途來滬、設立專署、據奧氏對中西記者團表示、報載暹政府苛待華僑情事、實不如所傳之甚、茲略誌其談話要點如下、</p>
<p>華僑暹民　同等待遇</p>
<p>華僑旅居暹地者、爲數甚衆、大半以經營米業爲多、雖中暹兩國、並未正式簽訂商約、但暹政府對於散居之華僑商民、槪與當地暹民同等待遇、並無歧視、卽暹民與華僑間之私人往來、亦情感極厚、絕無虐待及仇視等情事、外傳暹政府苛虐華僑、不可置信、</p>
<p>華僑在暹　敎育狀况</p>
<p>奧氏繼又述及暹政府施行强迫敎育法規等情、此事已遠在十五年以前、並不單獨施行于華僑子弟、暹民亦受同樣處分、華僑分子弟入校學習暹語、本無足異、在暹羅境內、華僑所辦之私立學校、來華、至南京北平及各文化區域、實地考察中國教育及文化狀況、以資借鏡、目下華僑私立學校所應用之教科書、亦為教育考察專員所編制、故無論暹民與華僑之子弟、入校求學、實與在華求學情況相等、惟其中有華僑所辦之十餘私立學校、因查有某種嫌疑故下令封閉、</p>
<p>華僑赴暹絕對自由</p>
<p>在暹撫養長成之華僑、外傳不能任意返國、此事亦絕對虛妄、蓋暹境華僑、無論何時、均可任意返國、或重行來暹居留、華僑在暹有確實地址、並經暹政府有記錄可查者、進出口均不需納費、按照暹羅入口法規、亦並無對華僑特加限制之事、中國人民之赴暹遊歷或考察者、可在境內免費停留三月、惟逾限或久居者、則每年須納暹幣一百元、的合華幣一百四十元之譜、</p>
<p>華僑在暹　貿易狀况華僑在暹者、不下百餘萬人、除大部份經營米業及種田外、其他均經營國貨事業、故國貨之運銷暹羅市場、其重心仍爲華僑所操縱、每年營業數量、亦頗可觀、又華僑在暹經營橡皮業及水菜業者、潛勢力亦不可海、華僑在邏設置地產者、暹政府亦予以自由、並無限制云云</p>

<p>中華與葡萄牙兩足球隊、今日下午三時在逸園决賽、以解决本年度上海萬國盃足球賽錦標、此爲上海最大而引入注目之錦標賽、</p>
<p>中華足球隊會連獲一九三〇·一九三一·及一九三五年三屆錦標、葡萄牙隊固亦曾得過錦標、但近數屆則從未實現攫取該杯之願望、本季該隊實力甚强、故無論如何必將有劇烈競爭曁引人入勝之比賽也、</p>
<p>前因一度小糾粉、馬賽兒及雷米狄兩埠際選手被擯於葡萄牙隊外、刻因種種困難之發生、己重行商請該兩選手投效葡隊、但今日比賽中、祇可見雷米狄之活動、馬賽兒則於前决慈善杯賽對中華隊一役中傷膝而未愈、仍在醫治中、</p>
<p>葡隊中鋒柯拉沙受傷後、已使葡萄牙斷送史高塔杯、今日能否出場、猶未可必、惟無論如何、該隊爲中華隊之危險物、中華隊係集東華優海兩隊菁華而成、雖獲勝之呼聲甚高、而意外結果之發生、並非難事、中華隊員必能極其全力、使萬國盃繼續爲中華保持也、</p>

<p>— Louisa　M．Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>「我當小心；不過個個人吃得很多，我想我還是盡量罷」。太腓說道，他還是傾向於那種俗見以爲感謝節就是吃得幾乎耍到中風的程度，或者至少也要肚痛或頭痛一回才行。</p>
<p>大家坐得已經很久，末了還各用蘋果露互祝各人的健康，然後立起來紛紛離座，蜀夫人於是對他們說道：「現在，我的，辟雨更立人你們安安靜靜玩耍，因爲今晚還要大熱鬧一番呢。」</p>
<p>裴先生却說道：「我想要帶着我整個的隊伍坐了車，外面去跑一趟，那是很暢快的；你可以在家裹息息，親愛的，要不然，你今晚耍太乏了。」等到他們披上了衣帽，滿滿地裝足了一大車，就立即出發作一决久長而愉快的游行，讓蜀夫人留在家裹好生休息，並且可以安靜地做了幾件小事情。</p>

<h3 id="c219">旣婚的職業婦人 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 郭柏霖</p>
<p>近年來，因着經濟的恐慌，生活的艱難，旣婚婦人之對於職業戰綫的進出，確是一個很顯著的可注意的傾向。但是在僱主方面，其採取的時節，却差不多以獨身爲主要條件，裁員的時候更是先裁旣婚的婦人，因此，勞働婦人的不安和不滿是日漸增加了。</p>
<p>無論怎樣說，生活負担之輕微的年靑女性，對於職業頗缺乏着熟情，就是爭議的時候等，也雖然一時很熱心，可是不能永久持續關心於有組織的運動。但是結婚後依然留在職位的人若愈增加，則婦人的組織便會變成恒久的，其運動亦會活潑了。旣婚職業婦人問題之熱烈地被提出討論的外國之例，最顯著地證明着這一點。</p>
<p>去年七月，在勃拉茜爾所開催的比利時社會黨的婦人大會席上，也曾被提起此問題，而由懷孕婦女提出了不可搶奪其職業，對其休養，醫療或哺育給予特別便利，又擁有失業中之丈夫的人，或未婚夫之母親視爲家長，對其被扶養者支給家族扶養金等等的要求。再婦人勞働無論任何塲合並不威脅男子的職業，並且舉起同等或者以上的能率，但是在工資方面却每比男子低廉。彼等用着種種的事實來立證，而要求了對於同一勞働的同一工資。在比利時，男女敎員的初任薪及昇薪率本來是同等的，自現內閣成立以來始吿撤廢，但根據此等的運動，去夏又告復活了。</p>
<p>去年六月所舉行的英國勞働黨婦人大會席上，也被吶喊了擁護旣婚職業婦人之勞働權的呼聲，特別是同等工資與懷孕婦女的地位確保及健康保證等，形成着問題的中心。</p>
<p>旣婚婦人的被裁，是使生活負担奇重的人，成爲犧牲。而因更換年靑價廉的人的結果，惟有更使女子工資低下及待遇惡化而已，而對此的防衛戰，各國已同樣地形成了無產階級的工作了。</p>
<h3 id="c220">日本職業婦女的現狀 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 曼之</p>
<p>除了星期日和特別的假日，每天的早晨都有成羣結隊的靑年婦女們忙碌的走向職塲去。在那裏，機械，事務，一切繁忙的事情，在等待着伊們，薪金在等待着伊們，勞動生活的報酬，擴大了伊們的自由。這種明朗的職業生活，以百分之百的魔力，吸引了伊們。</p>
<p>曾經把結婚生活的快樂當着甜蜜的夢而幻想着的姑娘們，只是在做妻和做母的等待中生活着，伊們的眼睛祗是向着內面——家庭裹瞧。但現在一踏進了現實的生活，過去的夢，就像水泡一般的破了。</p>
<p>婦女在職業戰綫上不住地進展着，伊們在非寄生的獨立生活中，去領略人生的滋味。但是誰都明瞭，現代婦女的職業生活，是爲着僱主的利益而展開的。雖然千千萬萬的婦女被採用，也不能認爲是婦女的世界被打開了，走進了幸福之門。例如日本主要的產業，製絲，紡織工廠的勞動條伴，在世界上的批評是非常壞的。公共汽車賣票的職務，非常損害婦女之性的機能，這也是常常受到一般識者所指摘的。但是婦女被採用的數目，却一天一天的增加，一般銀行，公司，商店等，都是因爲婦女勞動的低廉，並且什麽時候都可以便宜的使用，而大大地採用伊們。不但是結婚者不被辭退，而長期繼續工作的也有很大的增加，也就不得不多少加點薪水如，僱入的電話接錢生，開始每天祗有八角錢，漸漸加到月薪四十元，五十元，甚至八十元的也還是讓伊繼續工作下去。</p>
<p>但是到了近來，可以讓婦女參加的職業，多半是不須要多天熟練的機械的，補助的勞動。老練的長期間工作下來的勞動者，就沒有必要了。因此僱主大大的進行新陳代謝，每每以新的興趣來接近工作的生手——新來的更低廉的勞動者，才是他們所要求的了。這樣，近年來職業婦女的停年制的問題，就被提了出來。</p>
<p>在甲銀行，從昭和十年起，將女職員停年制，從四十五歲，一下减到三十歲，從前從從是一年加薪一决，現在隔年才一决，加薪率也减到三分之二以下。乙銀行，丙銀行，丁公司，都有了三十歲的停年制，戊銀行，和公共汽車行，甚至規定了以二十五歲爲停年標準。（這祇是限於事務員侍女與奴僕還是以二十歲爲停年期。）雖然婦女在二十五歲，三十歲是正當工作能力旺盛的時代，可是停年的斧，都把伊們從職業塲趕出來。被當做近代產業社會的選手，而受到一切職塲歡迎的婦女們，這一决却被壓制在三十歲的停年制之下了。</p>
<p>送子觀音對山額人人説：「這裡怨伯　　是我的世界呢。」</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>在有些塲所就是沒有停年制，也用爲結婚而被解職，就是結婚的事被放過了，因爲懷孕或生產而被解職的事情也很多。在己銀行，庚銀行，辛公司都是這樣的。設定「生產期間休息」規定的地方也有，因爲有這種規定而不能辭退已結婚者，就用別的方法使伊們解職，這樣悲慘的現象，什麽地方都可以看見。</p>
<p>對於工塲勞動者，有法定的產前產後的特別保護，在六星期的休息期間內，可以支取六成工資，此外在適用健康保險法上，可以支取生產費二十元。女敎員根據敎育部令，在生產前後也有六星期的休息，但在職業婦人中已婚者的此率最大（大的佔百分之六十），而且號稱已婚者方才適任的小學敎員們，伊們也因爲去年六月的帝都敎育會議上作了「懷孕女敎員休職一年」的决議而發生了問題。可以說現在一切職業婦女的動向都是如此，除女敎員，女工之外，郵務方面服務的女子，也有產前產後休息十個星期，薪水六成支取的規定，但一般的說來，是沒有實行過。據報章所載，A銀行有分娩期間休息三星期的規定，也是沒有實行過，所實行的只是隨着結婚而被解職的慣例。就拿那些分娩期休息三星期的規定來說，那是拿什麼爲標準來規定的？這除了用「聊勝於無」一語來形容外，實在沒有別的可說。</p>
<p>在這種情形之下，婦女在職業戰錢上的開拓，並沒有給伊們帶來什麽幸福，舊的幻夢已經被打破了，但伊們的前程，正隱藏着無數的暗礁呢。</p>
<h3 id="c221">顯微鏡下的俄國職業婦女　（上） <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 芝雲</p>
<p>「每一個人，都須作工；每一個人，都有職業。」這幾乎已是現在的俄國的一個普遍的信條。不祇全國的男子，是如此，全國的婦女，也都如此。第一决五年計劃的完成，百分之四十二，是由婦女負責的。從這上面，已可瞧見俄國婦女，對於工作的努力了。的確，在俄國，從十六歲起，到五十歲的婦女，可說每一個，都是職業婦女。所以在實際上，俄國的婦女，是儘不用再冠以職業二字的了。</p>
<p>俄國的婦女，已是深入到各個職業圈中去的了。任何職業中，都有女子的足跡。此輩女子，除了生理上的差別外，甚麽都和男子一樣。而且如今已有若干婦女，把頭髮也剪短了，高跟鞋也除掉了，改穿着男子的衣帽鞋襪，完全男化了。在俄京莫斯科，已經改裝的婦女，計百分之十七至二十，而允以從事於重工業的婦女，改裝的熱度最高，居改裝婦女中的百分之四十至四十五。</p>
<p>在第一决五年計劃中，莫斯科的婦女，幾乎有百分之三十以上，都是在重工業工廠中作工。因爲在重工業工廠中作工，所得的報酬，比了其他職業，較爲優厚。但是在那時候，俄政府消費節制的管理，十分嚴厲，所以此輩婦女，雖得較優的報酬，其生活，還是十分因苦。於是在那時候，儘有若干婦女，在每天的六小時或七小時工作之後，要求着再繼續工作三四小時，以謀獲取再好一些的生活報酬</p>

<p>婦女職業，在中國向來公認爲很幼稚的。一個女子，能在社會上奮鬥成功，能爭得經濟獨立的地位，已經不算容易；倘如更進一步，創辦某項事業，爲公衆謀編利的，那自然可推爲女中之傑了。在這個意念裏，我使想起了張湘紋女士，伊是一位產婦科女醫師，民國六年首創入和醫院及產科學校於霞飛路，十一年渡美入紐約醫學研究院深造，復赴歐考察各調醫　事業，造詣更深，回國後便發展伊的抱負，迄今二十年來，伊所艱苦經營地「人和」，被推爲海上完善的產科醫院，其精神毅力，値得欽佩。在它裏面服務的，都是女子，而且多數是獨身的女子，說「人和」是海上女子職業的發祥地之一，亦未嘗不可。此回我曾和張女十談了一小時的話，歸納起來，有以下五點：</p>
<p>「世界節育運動領袖山額夫人，業已來華，國人對伊的觀感，各有不同，女士爲產婦科名醫，不知對伊的感想怎樣？我覺得山額夫人爲人們所注視，因此首先提出節育的問題。</p>
<p>張醫生不假思索的答復我，好像對此早有主見，伊說：「山額夫人的節育運動，不過是喚起一般人明瞭多產的苦難，及節育的智識，要如說到效果，那就未必顯著。因爲能生產的夫婦，你要叫她節制，或是定期的生育，是極困難的事，决不是用言語或文字的宜傳所可奏效的。山額夫人鼓吹節育，已有多年的歷史，然而她不一定有成效的節育方法，平常書本上所說的用藥用器具等，也不一定靠得住，除非婦人經醫生的切實指導，纔可以有效</p>
<p>我常勸一般胎數已多而身體虛弱不堪再育的婦人節育，而眞能服從醫生指導者，僅十之三四，可目節育的方法，不易普遍。凡夫婦之有神經病。心臟病。肺病。花柳病等，固然不許生育，婦人生產過多或體虛者，我主張不論貧富，都該節育。有些人說貧者應節育，而富者可以多產，其實富貴之家的子弟，往往只知揮霍，不務正業，反爲社會之蠹；而貧家子弟，每多刻苦自勵，努力於社會國家有益的事業，但看中外古今歷史上正有許多成功的人，出身都是貧困的；但爲非作惡的人，大半是沒落的富貴後裔，所以智識階級可以研究優生，而節育是不限貧富的。我想女人最多生四個子女，就可以節育，至於不生育的女人，惟有以精力爲社會服務。再靑年男女，萬不能研究節育，吾則必增無形的危險。婚後多產的婦人，如要節育，只有淸心寡慾及聽信醫生的指導兩種方法。「聽說張醫生一向熱心社會事業，請問過去所做，以那一項最感興趣？」</p>
<p>「我很慚愧！二十年來，了無成績，不通　度光陰而已。過去所做工作，當以人和醫院助產學校　有興趣。此外如資助　苦有志者深造補助苦學生，免費治療貧苦產婦及貧病者　　　　裁培的人才，爲社會服　　　　成績者，都是我所滿意的　　時我遇到重症及難產的婦人，生命十分危殆，及至醫治與險，最爲快意。大槪世上一切事，凡打破非常困難而成功者，最爲得意。</p>
<p>「張醫生創辦人和醫院產校的經過情形，並應付困難之處，能吾追述一二？」</p>
<p>「我於民國六年創辦人和醫院及產科學院，當時上海還沒有產科學校，新法接生，亦不爲人所注意，入學的學生，大都是中學或師範畢業，程度比現在高些。民國十三年購地造屋、即今莫利愛路的院址，「人和」今年恰爲二十週年，畢業的助產士的二百餘人，分佈各省，都能熱心服務。民十七因學生不　實習，添辦尚賢堂婦孺醫院，並增設護士學校，說到困難二字，那是產科醫生所常遇到的。爲了病人產婦，每致日夜不安，寢食俱廢；惟有犧牲了自己的精神，來應付一切的困難；幸而我是沒有家室之累的，否則必不勝其繁碌。」</p>
<p>「張醫生對女子職業有何見解？並以何者最爲適宜？」</p>
<p>「女人治理家政，爲基本工作，若治家而外，兼能服務社會。那可算傑出的人材了。我以爲女子經濟有力量者，常然要求專門的學術：其次者，除普通學識外，一律學習看護的技能。我國人的舊觀念，往往藐視看護，而歐美日本各國，護士極爲普遍，甚至以公主之尊，亦有學習護士者。因爲做了護士，小之可爲家庭服務，講求衛生，或照料丈夫子女，不失爲賢妻良母；大之可爲國家効勞，戰時前方後方，都極重要。」</p>
<p>「張醫生爲獨身者，敢問對於獨身的利害見地　何？」我在發問之先，自覺胃味，但爲了好奇心的驅使，終於提出這爲人忽略的開題。</p>
<p>「我不主張女子獨身，但立志獨身的女子，必須先有牢不可破的信念，即誓願犧牲自己的一切與家庭的幸福，而獻身於社會，只爲大衆盡義務；吾則獨身便失却眞正的意義。我早年爲了醫院與學校的前途，便决心獨身，使我整個身心，，不爲家庭所牽累；到如今，我區區的志願，總算小有成就，於願已足。不過我不希望他人獨身，畢竟與民族前途，也很有影響的。」伊說這些話，態度是非常嚴疋的。</p>

<h3 id="c224">女子職業在哈爾濱的一頁 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 祝嘏</p>
<p>現在東北四省中的女子職業，要算是哈爾濱最盛行，起先一切的職業，都被男子們所把持，自從九一八事變後，女子們才慢慢的有出路了，也就是提倡女子職業的起始，在那時侯各機關也開始任用女職員，談到哈爾濱的女子職業，實在眞可憐，剛有一錢曙光發現在哈爾濱人們的眼簾裹，一轉眼便消滅黑暗了，像那種被污爲「花瓶」的女子職業，非但不能給女子們得到一些幸運，反而給女子們受了許多的痛苦！</p>
<p>各機關對於選擇女職員，完全重貌不重才，在應聘的當兒，他們先把女子頭上，身上，脚上，看了再看，相了又相，然後再决定伊們的去留，倘使前去應聘的女子沒有一張漂亮的面孔，那是很難錄取，如錄取之後，除了給伊們專司打字外，再也不給旁的工作了，據他們說：「女子祇有專司打字的能力」，有時女職員竟有工作做，祇得坐在辦公室裹，給人瀏覽，戲謔，當初的時候，這輩女職員大半是在高級職員的身旁，後來才普遍到每一個辦公室裹去了，於是，女職員被戲謔的事更加多了。</p>
<p>商店的老闆也被事變變得聰明了，他們知道店中沒有女店員來吸引顧客，那是營業一定不會發達，所以爲了維持商業的不景氣，也就僱用女店員了，不過，老闆對於女店員的主要條伴，是要一張標緻的面孔和一個苗條的姿體，利用女子的美來做廣吿，吸引顧客前來買賣，不到半月，營業突然的發達了不少，同時，飯館也僱用女侍者，烟館也僱用女招待，像這類的女子職業，好似在過着地獄生活，怎樣可說他是職業呢？完全是變相的賣笑生涯，把自己的肉和靈來兌換一些薪金罷了。</p>
<p>最近新興了一種女子職業，就是以前哈爾濱旅客大汽車被收歸市營後，市政的當局爲提倡女子職業起見，特地招考一輩女售票員，他們的條件是要年輕，最好年齡在十五至二十五爲止，並且要有高小以上的程度爲合格，前去投考的女子，大都是中學卒業的佔多數，在女售票員工作的第一天，一輩男子爭先恐後的觀看女售票員，也有專爲看女售票員而來坐一段汽車，所以那天汽車的收入，成了一個驚人的數目，無論何人肯相信號稱「東方小巴黎」的哈爾濱竟有如此奇特的現象嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c225">女推銷員 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 心</p>
<p>某一天的午後，當我們開出後門，想到馬路上去閒蕩一回的時候，突然來了兩個姑娘，面上不敷脂粉，兩個人的身上，都穿着黑色的旗袍，皮鞋是平跟的，每個人的手裏，拿着一隻十二吋的小皮箱。</p>
<p>「奶奶！阿要買幾槐香肥皂？」兩個中的一個看見了我的妻就來兜生意；同時，把伊的小皮箱打了開來，裏面是花花綠綠的香皂。</p>
<p>「這種香皂貨色很好，價鈿又非常便宜，祇賣八分大洋一塊，是我們公司裏面做廣吿的，別處地方買不到」！另一個接着又嘮嘮叨叨說這一大堆話。</p>
<p>啊！這樣一來，我才知道伊們是女推銷員；同時，便打開話盒子，和伊們談了一刻，才明白到女推銷員的生活，也自有其別入所不知道的苦痛。</p>
<p>爲了都市的不景氣，各業都是在一天天蕭條，衰歇起來，商人欲渡過這非常時期，當然非從推銷上着手不可。香皂是女人用的化裝品，招一批沒有麵包吃的姑娘來推銷，原是再切當沒有了，商人的用心，未始不苦，然而不景氣總究是不景氣，推銷而沒有主顧，伊們的麵包問題，還是沒有解决的方法。</p>
<p>伊們原是失業者羣中的兩個，被某公司招去做女推銷員還祇有兩個星期，薪水是沒有的，銷去一塊錢香皂，拿到兩角錢的回扣，如果有生意，一個月賺到一二十塊錢也不難，可是伊們在這兩個星期中，一天到晚在奔走，結果所推銷的，不到五塊錢的香皂，所謂回扣，也不滿一塊錢。十四天的麵包問題，不到一塊錢能够解决嗎？</p>
<p>妻終於拿出兩毛大洋，十四個銅子，買了三塊香皂，當伊們走出弄堂的時候，使我戚到這兩個女推銷的生活，非常可憐！</p>

<h3 id="c238">三百餘渡夫擾亂 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 大木</p>
<p>嘗經看過一部外國影片，裏面有一個機械構成的人體，會做一切人類所做的工作，干練而敏捷，而且不疲乏，不飢餓，不穿衣，不生病，生產多而消費少，當時我甚喜世界上有這批機械人出來工作，更希望能到中國來。</p>
<p>二十世紀的物質科學文明原已達到尖銳化，進而求之，不難有人事全部機械化局面。然而，真正到那局面實现後，生人褂着手閒在半邊，是否能有飯吃？是否能得到生活？就成為莫大的問題。即就眼前社會情形而論，亦就可見一斑了。這「一斑」在中國，尤其明顯。</p>
<p>報載：「南市董家渡……行駛渡輪之第一日……東西兩岸碼頭上，彙集舊有渡夫三百餘人……聾势洶湧，該處碼頭管理員，見此情况，誠恐肇成事端，遂將鐵柵門緊開。……一面由市公安局另派……警士七十名，分頭勸導各渡夫散去……」云云</p>
<p>這件事在一般人看來，似乎是不足道的小紛擾。實際上講，渡輸究竟比小渡船迅速而穩妥为「行旅稱便」，這一便又當然便在機械上了。可是，我們再替那「　有渡夫三百餘人」想想，他們每天賴以活命的工作被一二具機械盡行奪去了，今後他們將賴什麼養活一家大小。他們連出賣氣方汗血的地方都沒有了，而眼巴巴望着萬能的機械在面前肆威。他們的擾亂，無異是向社會呼援：要求恢復失去了的工作，要求生活的繼續。</p>
<p>我們在這一世紀做人，並不反對科學，物質，及機械的吉化與需耍。可是，畸形的發展恐怕還不是社會的幸福。资本家原想利用機械以增進生產力而攫取雄厚的財富；但另一方面亦得替千萬被擠出於生活圈外的失業羣想一條出路。「三百餘渡夫擾亂」就是一個雛形，「勸導散去」畢竟是暫且的吧？</p>
<p>影戲裏的機械人體，真有些使我不寒而慄了。</p>
<h3 id="c239">車廂里 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 卓爾</p>
<p>「別提啦！自從—他向那大國民看了看，自從……佔了關東就沒有一天安穩日子過，簡直什麼都成了他們的啦，不是刀把在人家手里握着了嗎？還說什麼，還說……</p>
<p>好好地人，無緣無故的被抓走了，說不定馬上就槍斃，他們說這是什麼「馬賊」，什麼「鬍匪」哪里有天日呵？　實（他壓小了聲音》真給他拚死命的義勇軍他倒沒法辦了……」　　　．</p>

<p>— 子南</p>
<p>家裏老鼠很多。白天還好，晚上簡直成了老鼠世界，它還是會在帳頂上打起架來。</p>
<p>半夜醒來，聽到老鼠正在咬床底下的破箱子，心裏便記惦着那一箱舊書了，次日一早打開來一看，果然不出我所料，一箱子的舊書已經變成了半箱，沒咬成碎紙的，也東一個洞西一個洞的殘缺不全，更且尿屎堆積，騷臭撲鼻，老鼠們你們已經老實不客氣的盤踞起來作為公館了。</p>
<p>整理書籍我有一個習慣！一面整理一面翻着看，因之每整理一次總得化費半天工夫。這一次自然也不能例外。</p>
<p>翻呀翻的我翻到了一本殘破的「三閒集」，這本書因為遭了尿瀆，所以頭上幾頁給我撕下來丢了，剩下的就從五十一頁起。第五十一頁上，有一篇「述香港恭祝聖誕」的文章，起先因為「聖誕」二字上有「香港」字樣以為是講所謂「外國冬至」的「聖誔節」的繼而一看，却原來是講「文宣王大成至聖先師孔夫子聖誕」的。於是拍拍有些骚臭的手看下去——</p>
<p>那篇東西「述」到「文人雅士，卽席揮毫」，「述」到各學校於祝聖禮後於「夜间或演新劇，改演電影」，也「述」到學校門口的「新式對聯」及報紙上面的「孔誕祝聖言感」也「述」到「孔聖會」主催演出的「風流皇后，」以及旁的戲院演的「濟公傳」，大鬧天宫」，「武松殺嫂」之類。</p>
<p>看了之後，我微微一笑，也就擱置在一旁，等整理完畢，報紙包好，用繩準備紥起的時候，我不禁一呆，原來那</p>

<p>張報紙上，就有關於「聖誕」的「北平通信。」</p>
<p>那通信說：「本年北平祀孔，此間當局主張特別隆重舉行，一切儀制恢復古禮，故事前卽積極籌備，因近數年來祀孔多用新式，讀遺囑，唱黨歌，行鞠躬禮，儀節簡單，致舊有之太牢俎豆，金鐘玉磬等，樂器已多年存置，積塵盈寸，皆須從事整潔，且現任官吏，多新貴人不諳古禮，亦須從事演習……市府為敬謹將來起見，特組祭典籌備處，規定二十五日拂曉為大祀之期，二十四日下午二時先在國子監演禮，初獻奏孔子歌，亞獻逢迎樂，終獻奏綿庭曲（皆古樂），祭品為太牢（計全牛二頭，全猪全羊各十六隻）邊豆（計栗子花生等五種），及帛爵等，由宋氏親率各機關首長致祭，一切敬謹舉行。」（二月二十八日時事新報）</p>
<p>北平的戲院近來演什麽戲？我不知道。至於上海，則向培良先生「巧格力姑娘」剛巧演過不久，而「濟公傳」，「潘金蓮」，「火燒紅蓮寺一，「唐僧取經」等「發揚國光」的「國粹，」正在演得非常熱鬧則也是實情。</p>
<p>「述香港恭祝聖誕」文中有男女學校的兩副「新式對聯，」現在也一併恭錄於後。蓋年代雖相差十年，翻那本破書，在六十一頁上有一九二八年字樣，想來該文至少是一九二七年作的。）而現在則依舊用得着。他</p>

<p>— 梁啟筠</p>
<p>我愛燈。</p>
<p>晚上，躱在小房間裹，靜悄悄兒，把看膩了的書本掩起來，我祇覺得除了這淡靑色的燈光，再沒別的什麽可愛了。</p>
<p>在前人的筆記或小說中，時常讀到有些年靑的孤孀，和苦修行的尼姑，伴着靑燈，寂寞而凄凉地了却一生。假如在靜穆的秋夜，聽外邊兒的梧桐在夜風裹訴着哀怨，而恰巧讀到這些，也許會淌下點同情淚吧。不過我並不是為了這樣而愛燈的。</p>
<p>因為——</p>
<p>在它的溫情的撫慰之下，沒有人不覺到光明是偉大的，永恒的。——應該感謝燈，這黑夜裹的唯一的「光明使者」</p>
<p>（你曾看見在黑暗的塲所生長出來的小草兒麼，那是多可憐呢！纖弱的，蒼白的。</p>
<p>（……沒有光明，就等於沒有生命一樣的嗄。）</p>
<p>由於燈，我就想起燈蛾，看那小東西儘繞着燈火，下死勁地飛着，舞着，聰明的人們會露出卑視的冷笑，說，</p>
<p>——愚蠢的東西啊。</p>
<p>然而，誰是愚蠢，誰是聰明呢？</p>
<p>頂聰明的往往是頂愚蠢的。</p>

<p>——那，我們看。</p>
<p>匆匆地整理了一下衣服，一脚兩步地跨上洋車，到火車站已是九點只差五分，買了票，奔進月台，站長已將紅綠旗準備好了。車廂裹擠滿了人，走，走，一直走到最前列的三等車廂裹，才發見了兩個空着的座位。這眞彷彿對於卓民及秋華是天作之合那樣的。車子開出了眞茹，初冬的江南的景色，一點兒也沒有枯凋的神氣。樹葉老是那麽常靑的，田野的一望無垠，離則是單調，却也是人胸境開拓了起來；紅的楓葉，點綴在這平疇，更感覺到郊野的自然的風趣。太陽又那麼嬌柔的從車窗裹照射進來。人的顏色又那麽期快，在不用了現代種種Cosmetics的柔軟的臉上，浮着那種自然的，從心臟裹反射出來的調和的顏色。</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the Jin Army in Taiyuan recovered Sanquan Town in Fenyang, the various armies continued to pursue and suppress the bandits, reaching the vicinity of Dui Jiuyu in Xiaoyi County. The bandit leader Mao Zedong and others personally commanded in that area, stubbornly resisting, and the fighting was quite fierce. In Zhongyang, our army yesterday eliminated the bandits in Nuanquan Town and has now advanced to the vicinity of Wannianpu. The communist suppression army of Xi County is now advancing towards Shilou. The entire Jin Army officers and soldiers issued a proclamation to the Communist officers and soldiers, which will be distributed by plane today. The main points of the proclamation are to specify reward methods for those who surrender with their weapons, whether soldiers or officers. Those who are willing to join the army will be employed, otherwise they will be given travel expenses to return to their hometown. Zhang Huafu and Hou Cheng, special commissioners sent by the central government to Jin to inspect the communist situation, paid a visit this morning to the Executive Yuan and, after consultation, decided to fly to various counties in western Shanxi tomorrow morning for inspection. It is reported that the central government will decide to assist Jin with force to eliminate the communists as soon as possible after receiving accurate reports. (Sixth Dispatch)</p>
<p>Taiyuan: Zhang Huafu, Hou Cheng, Gong Jicheng, and other special commissioners sent by the central government to Bing to inspect the communist situation, have been consulting with Yan, Xu, Zhao, and others for several days. They have thoroughly understood the communist situation and have agreed on joint suppression methods. They have sent several telegrams to the central government to report. Chairman Shang Zhen of Henan telegraphed Yan, expressing his deep indignation at the communist bandits' disturbance in Shanxi. His subordinates have all expressed their courage and determination to send a part of their troops to Shanxi to assist in the suppression. (Sixth Dispatch) It is also telegraphed that the bandits in Dui Jiuyu, Xiaoyi, are commanded by Mao Zedong. Yan has ordered Xu Yongchang's troops to suppress them. According to the Executive Yuan's statement, the Jin Army is fully capable of handling the situation. (Sixth Dispatch) Today, Taiyuan issued a public statement stating that after the provincial army defeated the communist bandits ten miles from Fen County, they are now pursuing the victory. The provincial army is invincible. (Sixth Dispatch by Reuters)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Yan Xishan telegraphed his Shanxi fellow villagers in Nanjing on the 6th, reporting on the progress of various armies in suppressing the fleeing remnants of the communists in Shanxi.

Therefore, the authorities of the three provinces decided to meet in Hankou to determine fundamental strategies to completely eliminate the bandits and ensure the peace of the border areas. The people can then successfully advance the government's construction projects. He reported the political arrangements of Jiangxi to President Jiang in Nanjing, with no other mission. He will return to Jiangxi in a few days after staying in Hankou.</p>
<p>Changsha: He Jian returned to the province from Liling at noon on the 6th and took a fast train to Hankou to attend the joint defense and bandit suppression conference of the three provinces.</p>

<p>Nanjing: Reports stated that President Sun will go south to celebrate the 70th birthday of his mother, Madam Lu. The reporter visited Liang today, who said that since the newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai published this news, comrades and friends inside and outside the capital have inquired about Madam Lu's birthday and Sun's departure date to the Legislative Yuan, and sent congratulatory telegrams and gifts. However, Sun himself believes that Premier Sun Yat-sen devoted his life to revolution, forgetting his family for the country. He never notified others of his annual birthday, and his subordinates never congratulated him. Even when President Sun got married in Honolulu, only a few relatives participated. When his daughter Sun Wan married Dai Ensai, most people in the Marshal's Mansion did not know, even when Premier Sun Yat-sen was the Grand Marshal. Premier Sun never used private and family celebrations to burden his relatives and friends with unnecessary social engagements. The spirit of the leader of the revolution should be like this. Although Madam Lu is reaching the age of seventy this year, President Sun believes that he should inherit his father's legacy and preserve the family style. Therefore, apart from family celebrations, he will not engage in any extravagance. He will not notify relatives, friends, and subordinates. He will not accept congratulations from all parties. There are still several months before the birthday, and those who have already sent congratulations have been declined. Those who have not sent congratulations are requested not to engage in unnecessary formalities.</p>

<p>Nanjing: Fishermen in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have been unable to raise cash in recent years, and the fishing industry is declining. Recently, the government established a fish market and will implement unified control. Fishermen have repeatedly requested subsidies. The most urgent appeal came from Ningbo gentlemen Yu Qiaqing and Liu Hongsheng, who sent a telegram requesting loans to maintain the fishing industry. It is heard that this loan has been discussed by the Ministries of Finance and Industry, and a decision has been made to handle it appropriately. The Ministry of Finance issued an order to the Farmers Bank on the 6th to provide loans to fishermen. At the same time, the two ministries jointly requested the provincial and municipal governments and the Navy Department to assist in protecting the safety of the fishing industry.</p>

<p>Nanjing: The accounting system and reporting forms of the Salt Affairs Audit Office of the Ministry of Finance have been modeled after the British system, which is different from the methods of other agencies under the central government. The Accounting Department has repeatedly sent letters to the Ministry of Finance, ordering it to be revised to ensure uniformity and facilitate auditing. On the 6th, the Ministry of Finance instructed the office to investigate and implement the changes, and appointed Zhang Shansui and Chen Jiayou to jointly handle the revision.</p>

<p>Nanjing: The Judicial Yuan explains two ambiguities regarding the application of provincial single-line regulations and the addition of litigation procedures for foreigners as follows: Provincial single-line regulations may be applied in judgments to the extent that they do not conflict with central government orders. A request by a foreigner to participate in litigation by means of an official letter cannot be regarded as a formal written application.</p>

<p>Regarding the provision of crimes of misconduct by civil servants, after being reviewed by the Legal System Group of the Central Political Council, the group reported that there are already regulations on rewards and punishments for general civil servants in the current regulations such as the Civil Service Regulations. The revision proposed by the Administrative Yuan to supplement the provisions in the Criminal Code does not seem to be in line with the spirit of the Criminal Code and is difficult to apply. Moreover, the current Criminal Code has not been promulgated for a long time, and it seems inappropriate to modify it easily. It is proposed that the Executive Yuan reply, and the council has issued a notice to the National Government to comply. The National Government has copied the original proposal and ordered the Administrative Yuan to return it as is.</p>

<h3 id="e34">British Defence Plan and Collective Security <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>The long-awaited British Defence Plan White Paper was published on the 3rd. The document, over ten thousand words in length, first described the recent tense international situation and the arms race among various countries, followed by an explanation of Britain's plans to increase armaments and strengthen national defence in the past year. The main points are: to build two battleships, cruisers, and many other auxiliary ships in 1937; to expand the air force equipment in the fleet; to increase the number of naval officers and soldiers by six thousand; to add four infantry battalions; to reorganize the existing army structure; to add four new auxiliary squadrons to the Royal Air Force; to increase the number of air force aircraft in the first line of defence to 1,750; and to expand or double the government's munitions manufacturing plants. The scale of this defence expansion plan is rare in the recent history of British national defence, but the extreme conservatives still consider it insufficient and express dissatisfaction, while the opposition Labour Party and peace-loving people strongly disapprove. There will be fierce debates in Parliament next week, and Britain's defence plan will have a significant impact internationally.</p>
<p>Expanding Armaments to Prepare for a Second World Slaughter is the Consistent Policy of the British Conservative Party Government. Since the outbreak of the East African War last year, Britain has felt the urgent need to expand armaments due to its vested interests. During the general election last winter, the Conservative Party made the expansion of armaments and the strengthening of national defence an important campaign policy. However, in order to cater to the psychology of the peace-loving people, they claimed that the purpose of expanding armaments was to consolidate the power of the collective security system, because most people in Britain are eager for peace, support the collective security system, and do not want war. This can be proven by the peace vote last year. The Conservative Party government, aware of this, everywhere showed its support for the collective security zone, but in their view, to enhance the power of the collective security system, there must be sufficient military force, and Britain's existing national defence force is obviously very weak compared with other countries, so it should expand armaments immediately. The Conservative Party leaders everywhere played this magic trick, which was very effective in deceiving the general public. For example, Foreign Secretary Eden's important diplomatic speech in Parliament recently (February 24) seemed on the surface that Britain's diplomatic policy was extremely supportive of the collective security system, but if we analyse it thoroughly, it is all to justify Britain's expansion of armaments. Eden concluded, "Now that good intentions are lacking trust among countries and terror is attacking from all sides, we must reorganize our armaments and gradually consolidate the strength of the collective security system. The only way to eliminate the terror of unprovoked aggression is to wait until all countries know that aggressive behaviour is not worth the loss, no matter what." Isn't Eden's confession very obvious? If Britain is really determined to support the collective security system, then why doesn't it actively participate in the European regional mutual assistance pact and use the collective force of peace-loving countries to punish aggressors? So Britain's so-called support for the collective security system is just an excuse for expanding armaments, and the purpose of this armaments expansion is not to enhance the power of collective security, but to expand the military power of the British Empire to protect its colonial interests spread all over the world and prepare to participate in the second world slaughter.</p>
<p>We have often heard politicians from various countries say that to ensure national security, armaments must be reduced, but now the spokesmen of British imperialism want to consolidate collective security by expanding armaments. Can expanding armaments really consolidate collective security? No one will believe this. The result of expanding armaments is only to stimulate the early outbreak of war. We should still remember that after Britain published its defence white paper last year, Germany used it as an excuse to tear up the Treaty of Versailles and reorganize its armaments. After Britain increases its armaments this year, various countries will inevitably follow suit and expand their armaments. As a result of the arms race, the crisis of war will naturally become closer. Is there still hope for the success of the collective security system?</p>
<h3 id="e35">In Response to Future Events, Britain Actively Expands its Air Force, with a Total Budget of £43 Million, Increasing the Domestic Air Force to 129 Squadrons <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The 1936 Air Force budget was released this morning, with a total expenditure of £43,490,600, an increase of £19,639,500 over the original 1935 budget and an increase of £12,488,500 over the final budget. According to the government's memorandum, the Air Force expansion plan is expected to be largely completed by the end of the 1936 fiscal year, hence the need for increased funding. The total budgeted expenditure for the three armed forces (Army, Navy and Air Force) increased by £26,544,500. This year's Air Force budget allocates £6,518,000 for salaries, an increase of £1,516,000 over last year. Technical expenses such as trials and research amounted to £18,491,000, an increase of £8,339,000 over last year. Civil aviation expenses amounted to £760,000, an increase of £164,500 over last year. The Air Force expansion plan began last year, and by the end of March 1937, the strength of the British Air Force will increase by 71 squadrons to 123 squadrons. In addition, it is planned to add four new auxiliary squadrons, and the existing five regular squadrons that cooperate with the Army will be reorganized into seven squadrons. Thus, there will be a total of 129 Air Force squadrons in the country, of which 20 squadrons are of a reserve nature. It is estimated that there are a total of 1,750 aircraft in the first line of defence.</p>
<h3 id="e36">British House of Commons to Debate Defence Plan on Monday, the Arms Race Only Hastens War, the Labour Party Prepares to Propose a Motion of Opposition <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>London: British Prime Minister Baldwin will move in the House of Commons on Monday to approve the defence proposals in the White Paper published on Tuesday. The government considers this motion to be a vote of confidence in its proposals and expects it to be passed by a majority. The Labour Party members of Parliament have today agreed on an amendment to oppose the government's defence proposals, which will also be submitted to the House of Commons on Monday. The text is as follows:</p>
<p>"The security of the country and the peace of the world cannot be obtained by relying on armaments. Only by resolutely pursuing a policy of international understanding, abiding by the provisions of the League of Nations, implementing disarmament, gradually improving international labour standards, and seeking economic cooperation can the causes of war be eliminated. Therefore, this House cannot support a policy that seeks security only from the national armaments aspect, which will intensify the arms race between countries and ultimately lead to war.</p>
<p>"This House is horrified by the proposal to reorganize the industry on the basis of war, which will greatly increase the inherent interests in the arms manufacturing industry and will create significant harm to organized labour and union standards. This House does not trust the members of the Cabinet because their worthless and ambitious foreign policy has contributed to the current state of unrest in the world."</p>
<p>It is expected that the debate on this case will last for two days. Because the matter is important, the government party will, as usual, issue an emergency notice to the members who support the government, instructing them to attend on Tuesday and do their best to ensure that this case is approved by a majority.</p>
<p>London: After the release of the White Paper on the Defence Plan, the opposition Liberal Party members have decided to propose a motion in the House of Commons to express their opposition when discussing this issue next Monday. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>Reiterating Support for the Collective Security System: The defence plan proposed by the government does not include a plan that would enable Britain to consult with other countries in accordance with the spirit of the collective security system and to set a ratio for expanding armaments. It is regrettable that the government has not made efforts to prevent the danger of an arms race. The White Paper does not contain the figures for the funds required for expanding armaments.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when the above motion is put forward, it should be supplemented by Sinclair, the former Scottish Affairs Minister and a member of the party. The party leader Lloyd George will also speak. On the government side, it is heard that Prime Minister Baldwin, Lord President of the Council MacDonald, Home Secretary Simon, and Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain will reply in succession. On the Labour Party side, party leader Attlee, Trade Union leader Clynes, former Transport Minister and current London City Councillor Morrison, and former Foreign Minister and member of the party's Executive Committee Dalton will speak separately to express their opposition.</p>

<p>The Times here published an article yesterday, detailing the importance of Hong Kong's position and future, saying that Hong Kong is the foremost base for trade with China in Malaya and a defence line for British interests in the Far East. We must preserve it at all costs. Therefore, it is also important for Britain to control the entire Kowloon Peninsula. Britain and China have common interests, and an understanding should be established on this matter. Other countries may be jealous of this move, but China and Britain should complete it automatically and should not be deterred by conflicts with other countries' policies and ambitions. The Singapore naval base uses Hong Kong as an outpost to achieve this goal.</p>
<h3 id="e38">British Cabinet Meeting, Eden Reports on the Anglo-French Talks, to Inquire Separately About the True Intentions of Italy and Germany <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>London: After returning here from Geneva, Foreign Secretary Eden recently presented a report to the Cabinet on the two issues discussed with French Foreign Minister Flandin in Geneva: 1. If the oil embargo is implemented, Italy may declare the Franco-Italian military agreement invalid. What attitude will Britain take? 2. Germany may re-establish defence in the demilitarized zone along the Rhine River, which France will resolutely resist. According to political figures, the first issue does not need to be paid attention to at present, as Italy may still be willing to conduct peace talks with Abyssinia. Therefore, the oil embargo is not yet being discussed. As for the issue of Germany violating Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles (i.e., violating the demilitarized zone system along the Rhine River), political figures also believe that it will not be realized immediately, or at least it will not happen suddenly. In general, if Germany gradually violates the demilitarized system by secret means, the reconciliation procedure in the Locarno Pact may be followed. If it publicly declares the abolition of the demilitarized system, then when France requests assistance from Britain, Britain will be happy to comply. The general opinion in political circles now supports resolving the Rhine River issue through diplomatic means, allowing the adoption of a "sky pact" to supplement the shortcomings of the Locarno Pact.</p>
<p>London: At yesterday's Cabinet meeting, the talks between British and French cabinet members in Geneva were discussed. It is generally believed that the British government will make inquiries to Rome and Berlin in order to ascertain the intentions of Italy and Germany. Regarding Italy, people in that country have said that if the oil embargo is implemented, the Franco-Italian military agreement and the Locarno Pact should be declared invalid, and Italy intends to withdraw from the League of Nations. It is not known whether this statement can represent the official opinion. Regarding Germany, if Italy declares the abolition of the Locarno Pact, what attitude will Germany take? In Britain, as soon as the Franco-Italian military agreement is declared invalid, the southeast border of France is threatened, and Britain should fulfil the obligations stipulated in Article 16, paragraph 3 of the League of Nations Covenant (referring to mutual assistance). Furthermore, if Germany takes the opportunity to re-establish defence in the demilitarized zone along the Rhine River after Italy abolishes the Locarno Pact, then Britain should also fulfil the obligations stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno Pact. However, at present, the British government clearly wants to find a way to prevent this situation from happening, and its attitude can be summarized in the following three points: (A) Abyssinia has accepted the recommendations made by the League of Nations' Committee of Thirteen on the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, but Italy has not yet replied. A decision will be made after Italy's reply arrives. (B) Contact should be made with the Italian and German governments in order to ascertain the dangers that may arise after the oil embargo is implemented. (C) If the recommendations of the Committee of Thirteen are rejected by Italy, making it impossible to resolve the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, then Britain must prevent Italy from taking drastic actions, so that Britain will not be forced to take military mutual assistance measures. If this effort fails, then Britain should resolutely implement the oil embargo and, if necessary, resolutely fulfil the obligations stipulated in Article 16, paragraph 3 of the League of Nations Covenant and the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno Pact. It is said that it is not certain that the Italo-Abyssinian dispute cannot be resolved amicably and the British government may abandon the oil embargo.</p>

<p>Addis Ababa: According to reliable semi-official sources, when the Ethiopian Emperor formally replied to the peace proposals put forward by the League of Nations' Committee of Thirteen, he declared that the negotiations should not contain the possibility of Italy retaining the Abyssinian land it has occupied by force. The Abyssinian government has today cabled a reply to the League of Nations Secretariat, accepting the peace proposals, and declaring that these negotiations should be conducted within the League of Nations' framework in accordance with the spirit of the Covenant.</p>
<p>Rome: Officials here today declared that Prime Minister Mussolini has not yet decided how to reply to the League of Nations' peace proposals, and that all kinds of rumours are speculation.</p>
<p>Rome: Tonight, Mussolini discussed the overall situation caused by the recent actions in Geneva and the entirety of European politics with the French Ambassador to Rome, Chambrun. It is generally believed that the French Ambassador will urge Mussolini to accept the League of Nations' recent appeal to stop the East African War. The French Ambassador will continue to meet with Mussolini and Italian Foreign Minister Suvich several times.</p>
<h3 id="e40">British Red Cross Ambulance Team Bombed by Italian Air Force; Attack Three Kilometers from Eritrean Camp Demonstrates Intent; British Government Prepares to Issue Strong Protest <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Addis Ababa, Special Correspondent Ochana Reports: Yesterday near Gua Lan Town on the Northern Front, an Italian aircraft suddenly bombed a British Red Cross ambulance team, seriously injuring four people. Three of them were reportedly British natives from Kenya. The tent where the doctor was performing surgery was completely destroyed, and three ambulances were also damaged. The British ambulance team was located three kilometers away from the nearest Eritrean military camp. On the same day, the Italian aircraft first bombed Gua Lan Town, killing ten men, two women, and four children. Then, it flew to the British ambulance team's location, flying low and circling nine times before dropping bombs. At the time, three Eritrean soldiers were inside the ambulance team's camp being treated. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>London: The Foreign Office today received a formal report from Mr. Mei Lai, the director of the British ambulance team in Eritrea, regarding the Italian aircraft bombing. It is currently being actively considered. British authorities had notified the Italian government one day earlier that the British ambulance team would move from Tai Xi to Hua Er Di Ya, and then to Zhua Lan. However, they only continued to notify the Italian government after the team had already arrived in Zhua Lan, following yesterday's bombing. It is expected that the British government will issue a strong protest to the Italian government. According to Mr. Mei Lai's report, the team's location was two miles away from the nearest troops in open terrain. The Italian aircraft repeatedly flew low over the team's tents, dropping a total of forty bombs, destroying three hospital tents, including the surgery and disinfection tents, as well as a heavy-duty vehicle. Initial reports indicated that three children from Kenya who were being treated as wounded were also killed, but it is now known that no staff members were killed or injured. The report also stated that all tents had Red Cross markings, and in the center was a flagpole with a large forty-foot square Red Cross flag hoisted on it. There is no doubt that this bombing was intentional. Since the team arrived in Zhua Lan, and previously in A La Ma Tai and Hua Er Di Ya, Italian aircraft had repeatedly flown low over the tents. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>London: The news that the British Red Cross ambulance team near Gua Lan Town on the Northern Front in Eritrea was bombed by Italian military aircraft yesterday has caused considerable shock in political circles here. It is said that the ambulance team led by British Major Boergena in Hua Er Di Ya City on the Northern Front in Eritrea was bombed by Italian forces on January 16th of this year. Afterward, British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Drummond, immediately received instructions from the government to notify the Italian government of the British Red Cross ambulance team's moving locations at any time to avoid a recurrence of misunderstandings. Foreign Secretary Eden also notified Italian Ambassador to the UK, Grande, to pay close attention and prevent similar incidents from happening again. However, less than two months later, the tragedy has reoccurred. It is generally believed that the Cabinet will engage with the Italian government regarding this bombing incident, but will wait for the formal report from the British Minister to Eritrea before deciding on the attitude to be adopted. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Rome: An Italian government spokesman today mentioned the "unfortunate incident" of Italian aircraft bombing the British ambulance team's tents near Gua Lan in Eritrea, saying that the Italian military believed the British ambulance team was still in Tai Xi. The British Embassy only notified the Italian authorities today that it had moved to Gua Lan. Regarding this matter, the British government has not yet issued a protest to the Italian government. The Italian aircraft dropped a total of forty bombs with great force, killing seven patients, but no staff members were harmed. The tents were clearly marked with a forty-foot Red Cross flag. According to the Italian side's description of the bombing, the day before, Italian aircraft were fired upon while flying low to inspect the tents, so they decided to bomb them with explosives the next day. When the bombs fell, thick black smoke rose from the ground, leading the Italian military to believe that ammunition was stored in the tents. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: After the Italian aircraft bombed the British ambulance team near Zhua Lan, British Army Major Bogeon, was killed by an Italian aircraft's bomb on the Northern Front. The major was a lawyer by profession and had previously served in the Third Dragon Guard and the Fourth Royal Irish Rifle Regiment. He was currently working as a transport officer for the British Red Cross team in Eritrea in an honorary capacity. He unfortunately died while retreating with General Gaza's troops from Amba Alarago to Zhua Lan. He arrived in Addis Ababa in early November last year and joined the service of the King of Eritrea, who ordered him to lead the Red Cross team with one hundred mules and ordered them to go to Tai Xi. He was sixty-two years old but still physically strong and had walked three hundred miles from Addis Ababa to Tai Xi. He had participated in the South African and European campaigns.

<p>Stockholm, Swedish Capital: The Swedish Minister to Rome today sent another dispatch to the Italian government, firmly stating that the Italian aircraft bombing of the Swedish Red Cross ambulance team on December 30th was intentional. The Swedish people suffered losses in this bombing, and the Italian government must provide compensation. At that time, in addition to the team leader, Hai Lan De, two doctors were injured, and all other staff members were killed. Swedish medical assistant Long Te Si Te Lang was also injured and died from his injuries on January 4th. The team was formed by donations from the Swedish people. When the news of the bombing broke, the entire country was shocked and many flew flags at half-mast to express their grief.

<p>Addis Ababa: The Eritrean government regards as laughable the Italian claim that all Eritrean troops except for General Nasibu's troops on the Southern Front have been defeated. It is said that at the beginning of the war, the King of Eritrea issued an edict to avoid concentrated large-scale battles, and this edict has been followed to this day. Now that Italian East African Commander General Badoglio has joined the Northern Front campaign with five army corps, it would be foolish for the Eritrean army to resist firmly. Therefore, the retreat of the Eritrean army on the Northern Front is in accordance with a predetermined strategy. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>

It is expected that Hitler will not immediately announce the abolition of the Locarno Treaty, fearing that after the announcement, the signatory countries to the treaty will rise up and implement the various clauses contained in the treaty, which would be detrimental to Germany.

<h3 id="e45">French and American Representatives Agree on Warship Plan; Hai De to Begin Drafting Soon; British-Russian Talks to Begin in Days <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>London: The final stage of the naval conference is progressing rapidly. French and American representatives have agreed on a warship plan today, so the drafting committee can immediately begin work. This plan stipulates warships of 15,000 tons with 14-inch guns, but specifies that if this plan is not signed by the signatories to the Washington Treaty by the end of this year, then the gun caliber will still be changed to 16 inches. Therefore, the gun caliber will depend on whether Japan agrees to sign. British Naval Minister Monsell is currently discussing alternative clauses with the American Chief Representative Davis. The British Naval Minister argues that the agreement should be invalid if the following situations occur: a war occurs, the signatory countries violate the agreement, or non-signatory countries exceed the limits of the agreement. Davis advocates for more specific clauses. This issue is currently being discussed. At the same time, British-German talks are now underway and are promising. Furthermore, British Foreign Secretary Eden has now returned from Geneva, so British-Russian talks are expected to begin in days. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>London: The General Committee Experts Group of the Naval Conference met this afternoon and first passed the report submitted by the drafting committee regarding qualitative restrictions on various warships (excluding battleships). Then, they studied the problem of "Non-Building Zone" (i.e., stipulating that warships cannot be built between two tonnage figures). It was decided in principle that warships cannot be built between 8,000 tons and 17,500 tons. The tonnage of Class A cruisers was originally set at 10,000 tons, but the Naval Conference has now agreed that construction of this class of cruisers cannot begin in the next eight years. Therefore, the tonnage of Class B cruisers, which is 8,000 tons, is the highest tonnage for cruisers. As for 17,500 tons, it is the lowest tonnage for battleships. The Experts Group then discussed the "Tonnage Flexibility Limit," because after each ship is built, its actual tonnage will inevitably differ slightly from the planned tonnage. If the actual tonnage is less, it will not be a problem, but if it is more, it must be restricted. This limit is set at 100 tons. For example, after a 7,000-ton cruiser is completed, its tonnage cannot exceed 7,100 tons. Finally, the experts studied the following issue: the problem of the displacement of various warships increasing with age according to the laws of physics. It is said that a solution has been found for this. The Experts Group will continue to meet tomorrow to discuss the maximum limits for battleship tonnage and gun caliber. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>Tokyo: Hirota's cabinet formation has suffered a setback due to a failure to obtain the cooperation of the army. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Because the members of the Hirota Cabinet remain the same as before, the army authorities have decided to demand that Prime Minister Hirota change the cabinet members. Otherwise, they will refuse to join the cabinet. (Allied Press) General Terauchi resigned from his position as Army Minister this morning. (Allied Press) At 10:30 AM this morning, a high-level meeting was held at the Army Minister's residence. General Terauchi, officers Gu Zhuang and Gang Bu, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Imai, and Chief of the Investigation Department Shan Xia attended to discuss the attitude that the army should take towards the new cabinet. Because the new Hirota Cabinet still relies on veterans from the political and railway fields as Minister of the Interior, and there is no sign of refreshing personnel selection or the possibility of implementing innovative policies, it was decided to demand that Hirota change the cabinet members, thus thwarting the cabinet formation work. (Allied Press)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Although the negotiations between Foreign Minister Hirota and General Terauchi have not yet reached the point of breakdown, the army's attitude towards Foreign Minister Hirota is very poor. Foreign Minister Hirota's attitude has also changed. If he makes changes to the cabinet members, it will be sufficient to expose his lack of conviction. The New Cabinet Headquarters is now engaged in vigorous coordination, but opinions have not converged. There is no communication with the senior politicians. The situation will inevitably lead to the surrender of the mandate, and it has now become a matter of time. (Allied Press)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Minister Hirota, who received the mandate to form a cabinet, worked hard all night last night to select cabinet members. Today, he personally asked for help from both political parties, hoping to gain their assistance. The only remaining problem seems to be a matter of position allocation. It was originally scheduled that the list of cabinet members would be submitted to the Emperor at noon, and a ceremony would be held to appoint the new cabinet. However, the bad atmosphere from the military suddenly intensified. This new cabinet, which was about to be smoothly delivered under the welcome and support of the people, suddenly ran aground. (Allied Press)</p>

<p>Tokyo: Army Director Gang Bu met with Foreign Minister Hirota at noon today and told people that the army felt that Foreign Minister Hirota's cabinet formation policy was vastly different from the army's understanding of the international situation, so General Terauchi visited Hirota. The army has no objection to the appointment of any individual, but Foreign Minister Hirota's current cabinet formation situation and understanding of domestic and foreign situations have not reached the point where the military can be satisfied. (Allied Press) Military Councilor General Terauchi Shouta said:</p>
<p>"The new cabinet, which is shouldering the heavy responsibility of unprecedented times, must have the power to fundamentally refresh the currency, strengthen national defense, and actively and fundamentally carry out a strong national policy. Maintaining the status quo with a free and inclusive color means compromise and regression. The army hopes that the cabinet will actively and decisively cultivate national policy. Compromise and regression will only complicate the situation and leave behind future troubles. If the cabinet does not have these conditions, I am afraid it will be difficult to overcome these difficult times." (Allied Press)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The navy has been closely watching Foreign Minister Hirota's cabinet formation policy and the composition of the new cabinet since the 5th, believing that although the cabinet formation policy is said to adopt a gradual approach, it still lacks the fresh air and practical courage that was initially expected. Therefore, it feels quite dissatisfied in some respects. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 6th, it dispatched official Ku Jingi to the cabinet formation headquarters to visit Foreign Minister Hirota and directly express the navy's overall views.

<p>Tokyo: Hirota Koki stated the following regarding the cabinet formation policy at 0:30 AM on the 6th: "The recent situation is serious, and the change of cabinet is unavoidable. In view of Japan's international relations, I have selected a diplomat to shoulder the heavy responsibility of resolving the situation. I am of limited ability and talent, and I am overwhelmed with fear upon receiving the mandate to form a cabinet. I will consider selecting cabinet members from a wide range of candidates and adopt new people. The army authorities hope to establish a military department and will certainly recommend appropriate talents as Army Minister. The number of cabinet members from both political parties will be the same. The position of Minister of the Interior will not necessarily be taken by a political party figure. In short, I have decided to select personnel based on the principle of using talents according to their abilities." (Allied Press)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Minister Hirota, who is currently carrying out the work of forming a cabinet, visited the presidents of the Seiyukai Suzuki and the Minseito Nagata at 9:50 AM this morning to report the process of receiving the mandate and explain the policy of the new cabinet. He also earnestly discussed the national perspective, humbly and frankly, and sought their cooperation and support. Hirota then went to the residence of the Minister of Finance to attend the last cabinet meeting of the Okada cabinet, requesting the Prime Minister Okada and other cabinet members to provide assistance. He also visited the presidents of the Kokumin Domei Adachi and the Abe of the Shakai Taishuto for the same request. (Allied Press)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Seiyukai expressed the following opinion regarding the request for support from the new Prime Minister Hirota: "The responsibility of national affairs is not a trivial matter. Foreign Minister Hirota has made an extraordinary decision. In this time of crisis, he has accepted the mandate to form a cabinet and engage in cabinet formation. As long as the new Prime Minister can value political parties, recognize constitutional politics, and strive for national unity, the Seiyukai, in view of the importance of the current situation, is willing to join the cabinet and provide assistance." (Allied Press)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Minseito held a cadre meeting at 1:00 PM today. Secretary-General Ooma reported on the details of the discussions with Hirota and agreed to recommend candidates to join the cabinet and support the party. All members agreed without objection. (Allied Press)</p>

<h3 id="e84">Details of the Suppression of a Heretical Sect in Southern Shandong; The Inside Story of the "Paiqian Dao" Resembles the Communist Party; Investigation Reveals This to Be the Second Group in Shandong <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The counties of Zouteng, Mengfeng, etc., in southern Shandong are characterized by overlapping mountains, inconvenient transportation, and a strong-willed populace. Furthermore, bordering northern Jiangsu, the area has long been known as a region difficult to govern due to the prevalence of bandits. It once produced notorious bandit leaders such as Liu Hei Qi (i.e., Liu Guitang), Zhang Hei Lian (already executed in Jinan), and Sun Meiyao and Sun Meizhu. There were also associations such as the Huangsha, Hongqi, and Heiqi. Fortunately, all of these have become a thing of the past due to the provincial authorities' combined efforts of suppression and pacification. Recently, the "Paiqian Dao," also known as the "Yiguan Dao," emerged again in Xicang Village, Teng County. When officials attempted to persuade them to disband, they resisted arrest with knives, injuring police officers. Fortunately, they were quickly suppressed before they could cause major harm. As for its internal workings, it indeed has an effect, resembling communism. It has many followers. The sect was introduced from Jiangsu. The Xicang Paiqian Dao is the second group in Shandong. Its leaders, Wang Shoujin and others, have been arrested and imprisoned in the Teng County Jail. The acting county magistrate, Wang, has come to Jinan to report the details of the situation to the chairman of the provincial government, Han Fuqu, and to request instructions on how to handle the aftermath. The rumor that descendants of Sun Meiyao were inciting rebellion is a misunderstanding of this incident. The details of its beginning and end are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Paiqian Dao, also known as the Yiguan Dao, has been spreading in southern Shandong for a long time, reportedly for over a year. All those who join the sect must hand over all of their personal property to the sect. After this, the individual no longer has any say in the management and disposal of the property. This sect was introduced from Jiangsu several years ago. The leaders of the Paiqian Dao in Xicang Village, Teng County, are two brothers, Wang Shoujin and Wang Shouyin. Initially, they simply set up altars to teach disciples and provide medical treatment, so many ignorant villagers followed them. Currently, there are many believers in the southeast villages, and many Buddhist halls have been established. The sect members hold their meetings at night in secluded places. Outsiders cannot learn about its internal secrets. This arrest was made because the captured criminals confessed, revealing that its internal workings do indeed have an effect, and its behavior is quite similar to that of the Communist Party. The disciples of Xicang Village are the second group in Shandong Province, numbering several hundred. The mark carried by sect members is a red silk symbol with a large red seal. Recently, the sect (during the first month of the lunar calendar) suddenly forged hundreds of steel knives near Yangzhuang Village near Xicang Village. Villagers were shocked and informed each other, knowing that they had ulterior motives.</p>
<p>Xie Xiweng, the County Magistrate of Teng County, is currently in Beijing for training, and Wang is acting as county magistrate. After receiving a confidential report, he immediately dispatched Director Ma of the Public Security Bureau, accompanied by several followers, to the village on the morning of the first of this month to persuade the leaders to disband immediately and return to farming. He also wanted to take Wang Shoujin, Wang Shouyin, and others to the county seat. Director Ma first went to Lincheng, met with Inspector Ma, and led twenty armed police officers to Xicang Village to persuade the sect members and announce the county magistrate's order. However, they not only ignored the warnings but also gathered dozens of sect members, wielding knives and resorting to violence. Seeing the unfavorable situation, Director Ma immediately escaped over the wall. His accompanying police officers were cut and injured. After escaping, Ma reported to Battalion Commander Kong of the Lincheng garrison and requested reinforcements to rescue the surrounded police officers. After receiving the report, Battalion Commander Kong dispatched two companies of soldiers and went to the rescue with Director Ma. After arriving in the village, Battalion Commander Kong first sent Platoon Leader Wang with six soldiers into the village for a final warning. Unexpectedly, the sect members, upon seeing the government troops, attacked them with knives before they could even speak. Platoon Leader Wang defended himself with a pistol, fighting as he retreated. The sect members, relying on their heretical arts, disregarded the law and cut down several soldiers, pursuing them out of the village. Seeing that persuasion was impossible, the main force of government troops attacked with platoon fire. However, the sect members were in high spirits and chased the government troops half a li away. After a long stalemate, the sect members' heretical arts failed, and they were completely defeated. Platoon Leader Wang and the besieged police officers were rescued. In this battle, three soldiers were killed and five were seriously injured. On the second day, they were all sent to the Huabei Hospital in Teng County for treatment. At noon on the second day, a meeting was held in the county government to discuss the aftermath. That evening, the captured criminals and suspects, twenty-seven in total, were escorted to the county government, along with a list of sect members, which included hundreds of people. Acting County Magistrate Wang reported to Han in Jinan that evening and returned to Teng County on the 4th. (4th)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Guangdong Province Prohibits Gold Exports, Limiting the Export Quota to 200 Yuan Worth of Gold; Provincial Bank Formulates Regulations for Purchasing Pure Gold <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the currency reform in Guangdong Province, legal tender has been in circulation. At the same time, provincial and municipal banks have been buying silver and fractional currency from various locations, which has been steadily concentrated in Guangzhou. According to a report from the Provincial Bank, it has collected more than 50 million yuan of silver and continues to buy it. It has also begun to buy gold, announcing that people should bring gold to the Provincial Bank to sell. The Provincial Bank has formulated regulations for purchasing gold to facilitate people's requests to sell. The regulations are as follows: In order to collect gold, the bank has specially formulated purchase regulations. Merchants and people may bring their stored gold to the bank for purchase at any time. Gold shall be limited to gold leaves and gold bars. The minimum weight for each delivery shall be 25 taels. The price will be announced daily by the bank. After the bank collects gold, it must be refined and tested to determine the fineness. A refining fee of one yuan per tael of gold shall be charged. The standard gold fineness shall be 99%. If the fineness is too low, and the test results show that it is less than 99%, the seller shall pay a smelting fee of one yuan per tael of gold. After the bank tests and accepts the gold delivered by merchants and people, it will first issue a receipt. After the test is completed, the price will be given according to the fineness. However, if the seller has a substantial shop guarantee or is jointly guaranteed by several shops, and the bank approves it, it may issue a portion of the value in advance at the time of purchase. The final settlement will be made based on the fineness after the test. If there are any changes to the regulations, they will be announced separately.</p>
<p>While the authorities are buying gold, they are strictly prohibiting the export of gold leaves and gold bars to prevent the outflow of gold. Anyone carrying gold jewelry for export must not exceed 200 yuan in value. If this amount is exceeded, the excess gold will be confiscated and treated as smuggling. The temporary regulations on the prohibition of gold exports were formulated by the Department of Finance yesterday and submitted to the Provincial Government for promulgation and implementation on the first of this month. The Customs Superintendents of all customs offices were also ordered to comply with the regulations. The five items of the Temporary Regulations on the Prohibition of Gold Exports in Guangdong Province are attached below. Article 1: These regulations are based on Article 3 of the Measures for the Prohibition of Gold Exports issued by the Ministry of Finance, which sets the export limit at 500 yuan in national currency. This is considered too high and, given the situation in this province, there is a risk of gold outflow, so special regulations are made. The other two articles still follow the Ministry's regulations. (Note: Article 1 of the Ministry of Finance's Measures for the Prohibition of Gold Exports states that the term "gold jewelry" refers to items whose shape or part is made of gold. Article 2 states that the gold jewelry carried by travelers must be for their own personal use only.) Article 2: The total value of gold jewelry carried by travelers must not exceed 200 yuan of legal currency in this province. Article 3: If the gold jewelry carried by travelers exceeds the limit in the preceding article, the excess portion may be confiscated. Article 4: Anyone who stores gold jewelry or gold leaves and gold bars, as well as ornaments containing gold, may go to the Guangdong Provincial Bank and its branches to have them purchased by the bank at the price of pure gold announced by the Provincial Bank. Article 5: These regulations shall be submitted by the Provincial Government to the Political Affairs Committee for approval and promulgation. (March 2)</p>

<p>In the kidnapping case of the grandson of the Fan family in Xiaokunshan, the subordinate county, last October, the Public Security Bureau devised a plan to capture Mao Jinzhang, who was in charge of negotiating the ransom with the victim's family, on the spot. Mao confessed that Zhu Guangyuan was the mastermind and that Sheng Qinghe and Zhu Baokang were accomplices. All three confessed to the Public Security Bureau and wrote their confessions. Since the case was a criminal matter, they were sent to the local court for trial. However, they repeatedly recanted their confessions during the investigation. However, due to the existence of written confessions and solid corroborating evidence, they were sentenced on the 6th. Zhu Guangyuan was sentenced to death for kidnapping and demanding ransom. Sheng Qinghe, Zhu Baokang, and Mao Jinzhang were each sentenced to life imprisonment. It is reported that the defendants all declared their intention to appeal upon hearing the verdict.</p>

Although the original incumbents still come to the office every day, they are very uneasy. New personnel are arriving one after another and being placed in various departments. On the 5th, Pang Shoubai, the head of the Third Department, resigned because the Third Department handles construction affairs and the clerks are all specialized. Now, new people are being inserted, and it is impossible to know whether they can handle affairs effectively. If mistakes are discovered in the future, the department head cannot be held responsible. Therefore, he applied for resignation. The technicians in his department also resigned one after another.

<p>After the county government was ordered to carry out the self-renewal registration of opium addicts, the number of opium addicts increased sharply.

Fang Guoding, the head of the Third Department, went to the countryside to inspect and formulated measures for increasing the number of retail and smoking locations, divided into A, B, and C grades. Grade A is allowed to set up eight lamps and accommodate sixty opium smokers. Grade B is allowed six lamps and accommodate forty people. Grade C is allowed four lamps and accommodate twenty people. In addition, the county's opium addiction treatment center can only accommodate 120 opium addicts per round. According to the provincial order to ban opium addiction within four years, it is necessary to expand the center. Therefore, it was decided to actively expand the center to accommodate more opium addicts and ban opium addiction as scheduled.</p>

<p>The military properties in various places in Yangzhou City, such as Yuanmen Bridge, Jiaochang Street, east and west barracks, etc., were previously reported for land registration and compliance with regulations, resulting in the suspicion of repeated payment of land tax. The property owners submitted a request to the county government to be forwarded to the department for instructions and explanations. The county government has now received instructions from the Finance Department, which roughly stated that if the households have been paying military rent in accordance with regulations, they can be exempted from land tax. However, the amount of military land must be delineated from the civilian land and counted separately. On the 3rd, County Magistrate Ma instructed the relevant First District Public Office to start the investigation and report to the county for verification and forwarding.</p>

<p>Lu Jinxian, a resident of Jiusheng Township, Third District of Jiangdu, learned of the whereabouts of the well-known opium dealer Shu Fanggui. He gathered many people, hoping to intercept and seize the opium he was carrying. As expected, in the afternoon of the previous day, he encountered Shu carrying dozens of taels of opium passing through the area. During the struggle, Shu Fanggui's head was beaten and injured by Lu, and he was bleeding profusely. Seeing that he had caused injury, Lu arrested Shu, together with dozens of taels of opium, and reported to the township public office, which reported to the Toutouqiao Security Third Detachment stationed there. The detachment sent a team to escort them to the Li Dianzhen Detachment Headquarters for investigation. On the 4th, the detachment sent the prisoners and opium to the county government for disposition.</p>

The Farmers' Bank of Jiangsu Province has branches in various counties and towns to provide rural relief, but this county has not yet established a branch. They have repeatedly appealed, but to no avail. As the spring famine approaches, farmers are in urgent need of loans. They recently telegraphed Zhao Dihua, the Director of the Jiangsu Finance Department and the Manager of the Provincial Farmers' Bank, requesting that a branch be established in You as soon as possible to provide relief.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Travel Notes from Hankou to Guangzhou (II) <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Junhao</p>
<p>(Travel Communication by Our Reporter) From Hankou to Changsha</p>
<p>The Jihe Wheel arrived in Hankou at 8:00 a.m. on the 2nd. We first went to the Jiangbian Hostel of the China Travel Agency for a short rest. The weather in Hankou was extremely cold, and the cold wind was biting. At about 10:00 a.m., Mr. Hu Xuantang of the Wuchang Transportation Office of the Yuehan Railway Zhushao Section entertained us to go to Wuchang. We crossed the river by the Hubei Construction Department ferry and landed at Hanyang Gate. We immediately climbed the Yellow Crane Tower to look around. The Yellow Crane Tower is no longer the original building, but a newly built tall Western-style building. The so-called Yellow Crane Tower of the past can only be glimpsed in the window of a photography studio. Looking out from the Yellow Crane Tower, Hankou and Hanyang are clearly visible, and the sails rising and falling in the Yangtze River are magnificent. The strategic importance of the three towns of Wuhan can be seen from the Yellow Crane Tower. After the tour, we took a rickshaw along the river bank to Xujiapeng, which is the starting station of the Yuehan Railway Wuchang-Changsha Section (i.e., Xiang-E Road), and the material transportation office of the Zhushao Section is also located there. I originally thought that the scale of the Xiang-E Road was not very large, but when I was there, I found that the scope of the Xiang-E Road Administration was no less than that of the Jinpu and Pinghan lines. All kinds of equipment were available, and there were dozens of office buildings and staff residences. However, the damage to the vehicles and the bumps in the ride on this road are probably unmatched by any other road in the country. We had to wait for the train to Changsha to depart at 8:30 p.m., and it was no use waiting in Xujiapeng, so we returned to Hankou to spend half a day. The streets of Hankou are clean and tidy, and the buildings in the French Concession are beautiful, but the market is very depressed, and the purchasing power of the residents is very weak. Even the Central Grand Theater, which is known as "the best in sound and light, and famous in the three towns of Wuhan," is very desolate. We went to see the "Three Stars Shining on the Moon" starring the Marx Brothers, and there were only a dozen spectators. Such a good film in such a large theater, but the business is so sluggish, this alone can illustrate the rest.</p>
<p>At 6:00 p.m., we took the Yuehan Railway ferry across the river and returned to Xujiapeng in Wuchang. Ten minutes later, we arrived. When the entire Yuehan Railway is open to traffic, Xujiapeng will become more important. In the future, if we handle joint transportation with various Yangtze River lines, and passengers and goods first arrive in Hankou and then cross the river to here, there will be many detours. I think we should speed up the construction of wharves in Xujiapeng to meet the needs. If the Shanghai-Hankou ships first call at Xujiapeng and then go to Hankou, it will be appropriate. The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company should take action immediately. After we arrived in Xujiapeng, we boarded the Xiang-E Road train to Changsha. Xujiapeng Station is very small, even smaller than Xujiahui Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. Although there are electric lights on the station, they are dim and the situation is bleak. That night, there were only three first-class rooms, each with four berths, so those who were traveling with female relatives had to hesitate. If there were many first-class passengers at the same time, men and women had to share a room, which was very inconvenient. We enjoyed the convenience of pre-booked berths in Shanghai, but here it was completely ruined. The electric lights in the first-class room were also very dim, and there were no quilts. We had to pay the porter to rent them. Three days ago, from Shanghai to Beijing, the lights on the train were bright and the blankets were as white as snow. Compared with this, there was a world of difference. I am not aiming at enjoyment, but that passengers should receive the corresponding treatment for the corresponding fare. From Wuchang to Changsha is only 365 kilometers, and the first-class fare is more than 14 yuan. The train started at 8:30 p.m., and the severe shaking made people's hearts break. Passengers in the carriage were like babies sleeping in a cradle. The degree of vibration affected every part of the body. That night, I lay in the car, drowsy, half asleep, half awake; the painful situation is difficult to describe. At dawn, I got up and sat up, trying to calm myself, and looked at the scenery outside the car, hoping that Changsha would finally arrive. I have studied the reasons why the Xiang-E Road has deteriorated to this point, and there are also reasons for this. Since there is a waterway from Hubei to Hunan, and the time is not very long, those who travel between Hunan and Hubei are trying to save money and take small wheels, which are economical and comfortable. Therefore, the railway business is sluggish, and the income is small, and the road maintenance costs are naturally unavailable. Therefore, the sleepers are rotten and cannot be replaced, and the vehicles are dilapidated and cannot be purchased, and they are left to fall into a state of no return. Now that the entire Yuehan Road is about to be open to traffic, the Xiang-E Road authorities are hoping that the entire road will be open to traffic, and they are also trying to reorganize it. If they can thoroughly reform, then those who travel on the road in the future can avoid the suffering of sitting in a cradle!</p>
<p>The largest station on the way from Hubei to Hunan is Yuezhou, but unfortunately, we passed through it in the dark, and I was sorry that I could not see Dongting. In the morning, we passed Miluo Station and saw the clear Miluo River. The water was shallow and the sand was bright, and the scenery was beautiful. From Miluo onwards, the sky was bright, and the scenery on both sides was fully visible. The fields in Hunan Province are all terraced, with deep water and thick soil, which is known to be fertile. Old trees are connected to the mountains, and the fences are interspersed, with a general view of paddy fields and shady summer trees. The mountains seen along the way are mostly ochre-red, and at the end of the mountains there must be large plains, because Hunan Province is completely a basin. At 10:40 a.m., we arrived in Changsha. Mr. Zhong Shusheng, the director of the Zhuzhou Material Factory of the Zhushao Section, Mr. Wang Yinqing, the director of the Wuchang Transportation Office, and Mr. Wu Yaoshu of the China Travel Agency met us at the station. The beauty and order of Changsha surprised us. The streets are mostly paved with large stone slabs, which are more neat than Suzhou and Hangzhou. In the prosperous areas, the scale of the shops is almost the same as that of Shanghai. Changsha is also vigorously carrying out the New Life Movement. Magnetic signs of "Pedestrians walk on the left and keep order" can be seen everywhere on the road. After careful inspection, I saw that pedestrians on the street walked on the left, and those who came walked on the right, without any slack. I occasionally did not pay attention and smoked in the middle of the road, and was also dissuaded by the police. Changsha has a unique phenomenon, that is, young soldiers can be seen everywhere, and it is not known which troops they belong to. This situation seems to be unique to other places. Xiang embroidery is sold in the city, and it can be found everywhere, but the prices are expensive and not fine products. We crossed the waters of the land continent (such as the Huxin Pavilion in West Lake) and crossed the Xiang River twice to visit Yuelu Mountain. At the foot of the mountain, Yuelu Academy is one of the four major academies where Zhu Zi lectured. It is now Hunan University, with a grand scale and elegant environment. It is a good place for study. There is a couplet hanging outside the school gate, which reads "Only Chu has talents" and "Here is the prosperity". From the top of Yuelu Mountain, you can overlook Changsha and have a panoramic view. The Xiang River reflects the sails back and forth, which is extremely spectacular. That night, we stayed in Changsha, and will go to Zhuzhou Lukou tomorrow (4th). (Sent from Changsha on March 3)</p>

<h3 id="e105">New Appointed Ambassador to Japan, Xu Shiying, Departed Yesterday for His Post; Boarded Ship Last Night and Set Sail at Midnight This Morning; Mayor Wu Hosted a Tea Party to Bid Farewell Before Departure <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Our newly appointed ambassador to Japan, Mr. Xu Shiying, along with his staff, departed last night on the Japanese ship Asama Maru to take up his new post in Japan. Before his departure, he telegraphed Ding Shaoyi, the chargé d'affaires at the embassy in Japan, to inform him of his itinerary. Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng held a special tea party before Mr. Xu's departure to bid him farewell. The details are recorded below, along with a conversation with Japan.</p>
<p>Conversation with Japan</p>
<p>Ambassador Xu, at 11:00 AM yesterday, responded to an invitation from the Japanese Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun newspaper and spoke with a representative of the newspaper via international wireless telephone. The representative first inquired about Mr. Xu's confirmed date of arrival and then requested Mr. Xu to express his aspirations for accepting the mission to Japan and his opinions on future Sino-Japanese diplomacy. Ambassador Xu answered each question in detail. The conversation lasted for more than ten minutes. As he was about to leave the country, Mr. Xu could not continue to serve as the chairman of the Guanghua Petroleum Company and sent a letter to the company's board of directors to resign.</p>
<p>Mayor's Tea Party</p>
<p>In addition to arranging all the matters for his departure, Mr. Xu also bid farewell to the retired army veteran Duan Zhigui, who was living in Shanghai, and other parties. Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng held a grand tea party at his private residence on Haig Road from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM last night to bid him farewell. Those invited to accompany him included Zhou Yu, the director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office, Yu Hongjun, the secretary-general of the municipal government, the directors of various bureaus of the municipal government, and over a hundred leaders from various sectors.</p>
<p>Departure Last Night</p>
<p>After attending Mayor Wu's tea party, Mr. Xu returned to his private residence for a short rest. Then, at 11:20 PM, accompanied by his secretary Huang Ruixuan, he went directly to the Huishan Wharf in Yangshupu and boarded the Japanese ship Asama Maru. Those who went to the wharf to bid him farewell included Guo You'an, representing Duan Qirui; Li Dachao, representing Mayor Wu; Zhou Yu, director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office; Zhao Tiezhang, deputy director; Cai Jingjun, director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau; Wang Zhinan, representing Yang Hu, the director of the Security Department; Wang Simo, the president of the Second Special District Court; and Qian Xinzhi, Xu Xinliu, Wen Lanting, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Zhao Jinqing, Zhu Qinglan, Xu Xiuzhi, Liu Yunfang, as well as Ashino, the intelligence chief of the Japanese Embassy; Ishii, the consul general in Shanghai; Funatsu, the Japanese director of the Public Works Department; and representatives from the Huangshan Construction Committee and the Renji Hall, totaling over a hundred people. Mr. Xu immediately met with reporters from various newspapers on the ship. According to his answers to the reporters' questions, he said, "Having been ordered to serve as ambassador to Japan, I will abide by the government's orders and do my best to promote the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations, so as to live up to the expectations of the entire country." Afterwards, they bid farewell one after another. The ship set sail from Shanghai at midnight.</p>
<p>Telegram Announcing Departure</p>
<p>After deciding on his departure date, Mr. Xu telegraphed Ding Shaoyi, the chargé d'affaires at the embassy in Japan, on the evening of the 5th to inform him of his itinerary. The Asama Maru will arrive in Kobe on the 9th and will not transfer elsewhere. He will then take a train directly to Tokyo to take up his post. The embassy staff accompanying Mr. Xu include Counselor Wang Pengsheng, Secretaries Huang Ruixuan and Hu Mai, and a retinue of five people. Mr. Xu's private secretary, Lin Xiaogu, went to Japan last week to make all the arrangements.</p>
<p>Carrying Local Products</p>
<p>Upon deciding to go to Japan to take up his post, Mr. Xu purchased a large quantity of famous domestic products, such as Jiangxi porcelain, Anhui brushes and ink, and Xuan paper, in preparation for bringing them to his post and distributing them to Japanese officials and friends in Japan. In addition, he purchased thirty small bottles of Shaoxing aged wine to bring to his post to be used for banquets.</p>
<p>Reason for Changing Ships</p>
<p>It is reported that Mr. Xu originally planned to take the Dollar Steamship Company's President Hoover on the 3rd of this month to take up his post. However, the departure date was suddenly postponed. According to a reporter from the New Sound News Agency, the reason for Mr. Xu's postponement was due to the recruitment by the shipping company. When Mr. Xu intended to take the Hoover, the Dollar Steamship Company expressed goodwill and was willing to fly the ambassador's flag for Mr. Xu to show its respect. When the matter was heard by the Nippon Yusen Kaisha, they sent personnel to request Mr. Xu to take a Japanese ship, as it was appropriate for the ambassador to Japan to take a Japanese ship during this time of Sino-Japanese friendship. They also promised an 80% discount on tickets and other items, and also agreed to fly the ambassador's flag to show their respect. Therefore, Mr. Xu, considering the sincerity of the Japanese shipping company, postponed his departure and changed to a Japanese ship.</p>
<h3 id="e106">The Mint's February Production: Factory-Made Subsidiary Coins; Approved for Release, Announcement to the Public <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Announcement by the Central Mint Examination Committee (No. 31): For the purpose of announcement, upon investigation, the Class B 1,000-yuan factory bars (880 fineness) produced by the Central Mint in February of the 25th year, from No. 56294 to No. 56381, a total of 88 bars, have been stamped by Inspector Ge Laide, who was appointed by the committee, in accordance with the regulations. The fineness and weight of each bar have been listed and registered. In addition, the new subsidiary coins produced by the factory in the same month include 890,000 20-cent nickel coins, 2.7 million 10-cent nickel coins, 4.68 million 5-cent nickel coins, 25.5 million 1-cent copper coins, and 8.52 million half-cent copper coins. All five types of subsidiary coins have been sealed under the supervision of personnel sent by the committee. In addition to being approved for release separately, a detailed table is attached for public notice. This announcement is made by Chairman Kong Xiangxi, Republic of China, March 2, 25th year.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Large Batch of New Subsidiary Coins Shipped to Beijing; Transferred to Xuzhou, Jinan, and Qingdao for Circulation; Three Batches Totaling Over 23,000 <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance issued new subsidiary coins, they have been used uniformly in various places, and the exchange is extremely crowded. Although the Central Mint has added night shifts to speed up production, it still feels insufficient for circulation. For the sake of needs in Xuzhou, Jinan, Qingdao, and other places, a large batch of new subsidiary coins has been shipped to Beijing in recent days, and then transferred by the Central Bank of Nanjing to the Xuzhou, Jinan, and Qingdao branches for circulation. The first batch was 12,800 yuan, the second batch was 6,000 yuan, and the third batch was 5,000 yuan. They were shipped to Beijing on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiang'an ship a few days ago. The three batches totaled 23,800 yuan. The Central Mint is still continuing to add night shifts to meet the needs of various places.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Jiangxi Yumin Bank Transports Goods for Customers; Transported from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway to Shanghai <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>In order to facilitate people's livelihood and develop agricultural, industrial, and commercial enterprises, the Jiangxi Yumin Bank has established branches and offices in various counties of western Jiangxi and other places in recent years, and has established special transportation departments in places where various steamships converge to engage in the transfer and transportation of import and export goods for customers. Jiangxi exports include rice, porcelain, tea, summer cloth, and paper, while imports include cotton yarn, piece goods, flour, hardware, and miscellaneous foreign goods. It is said that rice exports are the largest, with a huge annual volume of hundreds of thousands of bags. Since the bank established an office in Shanghai, its transfer and transportation of import and export goods for customers has become even more developed. However, before the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was extended to Nanchang, Jiangxi, a small number of these transports were still entrusted to foreign shipping companies for shipping on the Yangtze River. In order to seek faster and more convenient transport, it has now been changed to transport via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, through the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. The bank has negotiated with the Traffic Department of the two railway bureaus and has been allowed to report and transport goods for customers (limited to goods imported and exported from Jiangxi) and given special treatment, exempting it from all deposits. The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus believe that the matter is related to the development of the interior and is also beneficial to the business of the railway, and have agreed to a one-year trial. However, in order to prevent merchants from citing this as a precedent, they have instructed the bank to submit a letter of certification from the主管官廳主管官廳 (responsible authorities) in order to emphasize the intention of cooperation and high regard for transportation.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Ministry of Finance Approves the National Goods Factory Association; Detailed Rules for Relief Loans Have Been Established <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Association previously requested the Ministry of Finance to allocate 20 million yuan of Reconstruction Public Bonds to relieve industry and commerce due to the economic downturn. Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance replied: "Your petition of February 13, 25th year, requesting the approval to allocate 20 million yuan of Reconstruction Public Bonds to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications for exclusive management of chattel and real estate mortgage loans for national goods factories in order to maintain the national goods industry and the livelihood of all workers, has been noted. The Ministry has always attached great importance to the relief of industry and commerce. Last year, the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Loan Review Committee was established to handle industry and commerce loans, and the Ministry allocated 20 million yuan of treasury bills as the second guarantee for the loans, and stipulated ten principles for the relief of Shanghai's industry and commerce loans. Article 2 clearly stipulates that loan applications for industry and commerce are limited to factories that manufacture national goods, merchants that sell national goods, and those that transport national goods for export. The Loan Committee has been ordered to comply with the regulations and instructed the Shanghai Bankers Association and the Chamber of Commerce to file the case. If the factories of the association do need loan relief, they should directly negotiate and handle the matter in accordance with the loan rules approved by the Loan Committee."</p>
<h3 id="e110">Siamese Commercial Envoy Talks About the Situation of Overseas Chinese in Siam; Emphatically States That the Siamese Government Does Not Mistreat Overseas Chinese <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shenshi News Agency, Siamese Commercial Envoy Ao Chetanata, since arriving in China on Tuesday (the 3rd), has gone to Beijing to meet with our foreign affairs, railway, and other authorities to discuss increasing Sino-Siamese trade and plans to establish a commercial office in Shanghai to communicate Sino-Siamese commercial information. After completing his official duties, he will return to Shanghai on the evening of the 3rd and is scheduled to take a ship to Hong Kong on the 10th of this month to return to Siam. Then, in May or June, he will first come to Shanghai to establish the special office. According to Ao's statement to the Chinese and Western press corps, reports of the Siamese government mistreating overseas Chinese are not as severe as reported. Here is a brief record of his key points:</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese and Siamese Citizens Receive Equal Treatment</p>
<p>A large number of overseas Chinese reside in Siam, most of whom are engaged in the rice industry. Although there is no formal trade agreement between China and Siam, the Siamese government treats overseas Chinese merchants and citizens scattered throughout the country equally with local Siamese citizens and does not discriminate against them. Even the private interactions between Siamese citizens and overseas Chinese are very affectionate, and there is absolutely no mistreatment or animosity. The rumors that the Siamese government mistreats overseas Chinese are unbelievable.</p>
<p>Educational Situation of Overseas Chinese in Siam</p>
<p>Ao went on to describe the Siamese government's implementation of compulsory education regulations, etc. This matter was already in place fifteen years ago and is not solely implemented on overseas Chinese children; Siamese citizens are also subject to the same treatment. It is not unusual for overseas Chinese children to attend school to learn Siamese. Private schools run by overseas Chinese in Siam have come to Nanjing, Beiping, and various cultural regions to conduct on-the-ground investigations of China's education and culture to learn from them. At present, the textbooks used in private schools run by overseas Chinese are also compiled by education inspection specialists. Therefore, whether Siamese or overseas Chinese children attend school, the situation is equivalent to studying in China. However, more than ten private schools run by overseas Chinese were ordered to be closed because they were found to be suspicious.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Are Absolutely Free to Go to Siam</p>
<p>The rumors that overseas Chinese who are raised in Siam cannot return to their country at will are also absolutely false. Overseas Chinese in Siam can return to their country at any time or return to Siam to reside. Overseas Chinese who have a definite address in Siam and are recorded by the Siamese government do not need to pay fees for import and export. According to Siamese import regulations, there are also no special restrictions on overseas Chinese. Chinese people who travel or investigate in Siam can stay in the country for free for three months. However, those who exceed the limit or reside for a long time must pay 100 Siamese coins per year, which is equivalent to 140 Chinese coins.</p>
<p>Trade Situation of Overseas Chinese in Siam</p>
<p>There are no fewer than one million overseas Chinese in Siam. In addition to most of them being engaged in the rice industry and farming, others are engaged in the national goods industry. Therefore, the transportation and sale of national goods in the Siamese market is still controlled by overseas Chinese. The annual business volume is also quite considerable. In addition, the potential power of overseas Chinese engaged in the rubber and aquatic vegetable industries in Siam cannot be underestimated. The Siamese government also gives overseas Chinese freedom to set up real estate in Siam without restrictions.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Poor Weather Between Guizhou and Yunnan; Kunming Aircraft Forced to Land; Aircraft Dispatched Yesterday to Search Have Not Yet Found the Landing Site <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation's Chongqing-Kunming Qian San three-engine Kunming Ford aircraft flew from Chongqing to Guiyang at 12:15 noon on the 5th of this month. It arrived in Guiyang at 2:15 PM on the afternoon of the same day. It refueled in Guiyang and left Guiyang at 2:50 PM, originally planning to fly back to Chongqing. At 3:30 PM, it received a wireless telegram from the aircraft stating that the aircraft had flown near Tongzi at that time. At 4:10 PM, it was reported that the weather ahead was extremely bad and it could not proceed, so it had to turn back to Guiyang. At 5:05 PM, it was reported that the weather in Guiyang had also suddenly changed for the worse, so it could not fly to Guiyang either. At 5:50 PM, the pilot reported that the aircraft was covered in ice and snow. The pilot decided that the weather was good at the time, so he raised the aircraft above the clouds and decided to proceed to Kunming. Until 6:25 PM, the aircraft reported that it was still above the clouds and flying towards the Yunnan border. At 6:30 PM, it was reported that the aircraft would land in Qujing, Yunnan. Since then, the company has not received any report on the landing situation. It is questionable whether the wireless machine was damaged by the shock after the aircraft landed. The company has been deeply concerned that the Kunming station has not reported the aircraft's arrival in Kunming since 7:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th. On the 6th (yesterday), it received a telegram from the Fei Yang office stating that Director Gu had dispatched a military aircraft to search for the aircraft's whereabouts. However, according to the latest telegram, the military aircraft returned to Anshun due to poor weather. Therefore, as of 6:00 PM last night, the company had not received any definite news about the aircraft's landing. The Kunming three-engine aircraft was carrying three passengers, pilot O'Harai, co-pilot Tan Boqi, and wireless operator Chen Naian. The company also sent a telegram to the Kunming station yesterday ordering personnel to take cars along the land route to search for the aircraft in the Qujing area, but it has not received any reply on the outcome.</p>

<p>Only a Few Transactions</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Sound News Agency visited a leader of a real estate merchant yesterday and asked about the recent situation of the real estate business. According to the conversation, after the decline of the real estate industry, it was fortunate that the government and the banking industry tried their best to provide relief, and it has gradually become active. According to the current real estate prices, it is about half of the peak period. However, there are few transactions. Recently, the China Construction Bank purchased the 19-story building at the corner of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road from the China General Chamber of Commerce for 1.5 million yuan. The Bank of China purchased more than 60 acres of real estate behind the Hardoon Garden on Fuxing Road from Yeguang Real Estate Company, and also purchased the real estate north of the New World on Jing'an Temple Road. The expectation of the real estate industry now is to quickly establish a real estate mortgage bank to accept real estate mortgages.</p>

<p>The Federation of Labor and Industry Will Regularly Invite Him to Conduct On-Site Testing</p>
<p>Qian Chengxu of the China Industrial Federation told a reporter from the New Sound News Agency yesterday that in recent years, emerging industries abroad have been changing rapidly. If China promotes domestic products, it can only solve the difficulty of import surpluses by establishing factories and manufacturing them domestically. After investigating artificial leather spray paint, artificial ivory, and artificial flavors, several industries do not yet exist in China and are in great demand. Currently, Dr. Joys, a British Royal Technician, is an expert in seven items and four industries. He will come to China from Japan soon and return to his country via Shanghai. The China Industrial Federation has specially invited Dr. Joys to the meeting to conduct on-site testing on a regular basis. If domestic industrialists are interested in establishing this business, they can first register with the China Industrial Association at No. 115 Hankou Road. The association will regularly invite them to meet and discuss the above-mentioned four industries.</p>

<p>The Stern Faces the Sky and the Bow Faces Down, a Dangerous Situation; No Hope of Escape During This Shallow Water Period</p>
<p>The Tongshang steamer of the Tongshang Steamship Company ran aground on Shiyezhou Beach due to the river pilot's mistaken navigation on the Yangtze River. At that time, it was unknown what happened, but the stern was high on the beach, and the bottom of the ship had no water scale, while the bow was still on the shallow beach by the river, with only a little more than a foot of river water, resulting in a high stern and low bow. It is very dangerous. The stern cabin is suspended on the shore because the ship ran aground first, and then tried to free itself and turn the ship, resulting in the current situation. There is no hope of escape during this one or two months of shallow water. After receiving the news, the Shanghai company provided food to the crew, but there was no way to rescue it.</p>

<p>The First Ship After Navigation in the North Sea</p>
<p>From the beginning of January to today, for more than sixty days, the sea off Dagukou has been blocked by ice. A total of more than forty ships have been stranded in Shanghai and Tianjin, and the goods piled up in the warehouses in both places. No Chinese merchant ships in Shanghai dared to sail to Tianjin. Now that the ice is gradually melting and the sea route is open, the Taikoo Company's Hunan steamer has decided to sail as usual because the ship's hull has not been damaged. Fully loaded with passengers and goods, it will depart from Shanghai for Tianjin today. This is the first ship from Shanghai to Tianjin after the ice blocked Dagukou. The Ewo Steamship Company's Fuxing steamer, also fully loaded with passengers and goods, will follow the Hunan steamer.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Antiquities Exhibited in England Will Be Shipped Back; Ye Gongchuo's Opinion <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Foreigners Participating in the Display of Our Country's Antiquities Is a Great Shame to Our Country's History</p>
<p>The Chinese Antiquities Exhibition held in London has been attracting a large number of visitors since it opened at the end of November last year. Westerners who appreciate our country's art have praised it in unison. However, the exhibition closed on the 3rd of this month, and the exhibited antiquities will be shipped back to China in the middle of next month. According to Ye Gongchuo, a member of the Antiquities Preservation Committee, the Chinese antiquities exhibited in London will be shipped directly to Beijing after they are shipped back next month, and will be unloaded in Beijing. After being publicly exhibited in Beijing, they will be sent to the Antiquities Preservation Library for preservation. However, the impression given to Westerners by the Chinese antiquities exhibited in England this time, although praised by Westerners for the art itself, is a great shame to our country on the other hand. The antiquities that our country transported to England for display are only a part of them. Other countries such as England, the United States, Japan, and France all have our country's antiquities participating in the exhibition. This is enough to show the stain on our country's history. The Chinese antiquities obtained by foreigners were mostly taken away when the Sino-French Allied Forces and the Eight-Nation Alliance attacked Beijing during the wars of the Former Qing Dynasty. In addition, there were many unscrupulous Chinese who coveted heavy profits and privately sold national antiquities to foreigners. These antiquities were all displayed at the exhibition by foreigners, which we feel is a great shame.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Ministry of Industry Supports the Shanghai International Exposition; Guo Bingwen, Director of the International Trade Bureau, Gives a Speech <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Various matters for the Shanghai International Exposition (i.e., the Shanghai World Exposition reported in the previous newspaper), which is being actively prepared to be held in Shanghai, are being carried out separately. The construction of the venue can be completed in June, and it will officially open on July 1. The Ministry of Industry and leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, believe that the holding of the exposition in Shanghai is sufficient to save the decline of the city's market and have expressed their support. Guo Bingwen, Director of the International Trade Bureau, gave a special speech on this yesterday. In addition to expressing his support, he also hoped that the national goods industry throughout the country would send their fine products to the exhibition at that time so that the people of the country would have a deep understanding of purchasing and using national goods. The details of Guo's speech and the recent progress of the exhibition are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Guo's Speech</p>
<p>According to Guo Bingwen, Director of the International Trade Bureau, to a reporter from the Central News Agency, the depression of our country's industry and commerce is partly due to the lack of purchasing power of the people and partly due to the psychology of the middle and upper classes who love to use foreign goods. For example, in cosmetics and clothing, there are fine national goods, but annual imports still account for a large figure. After repeated national goods exhibitions, this psychology has gradually changed slightly. Now that Chinese and foreign people are preparing for the Shanghai International Exposition in Shanghai and will gather Chinese and foreign goods for public exhibition at the venue, on the one hand, consumers can know that there are indeed national goods that rival foreign goods, and on the other hand, manufacturers can know how to improve by observing and comparing. At the same time, foreign audiences can also have a considerable understanding of excellent Chinese goods and know what to purchase. Therefore, if the exhibition is handled properly and the products displayed by the manufacturers are carefully selected, it will be helpful to the future of revitalizing national goods.</p>
<p>Display of National Goods</p>
<p>The venue of the exhibition, at the intersection of Yangshupu Road and Guangxin Road, has already started construction and can be completed in mid-June. It will officially open on July 1. As for all the preparatory matters, according to news from the preparatory office of the exhibition at No. 356 Jing'an Temple Road, the equipment in the venue is divided into two parts: exposition and entertainment. The entertainment part will concentrate various mechanical and artistic entertainment in one place to enhance the interest of visitors. The exposition part, in addition to setting up a special national goods display department and a national goods retail department to promote national goods, will also collect and display various Chinese and foreign cultural and artistic goods in categories for the public to view. In recent days, many national goods manufacturers have heard the news and have come to request to participate. Because there are many famous local products and valuable items in various provinces and cities of our country, letters have been sent to the agencies in various provinces, cities, and border areas to invite them to select excellent items and transport them to the exhibition for the public to observe.</p>

<p>Concrete Measures Not Yet Decided at Yesterday's Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association states that since the six shipping companies, including Jardine Matheson, Swire, China Merchants, Nissin, Sanbei, and Ning Shao, jointly implemented a water freight surcharge for the Yangtze River route, cargo transportation has been measured using a standardized company scale, resulting in a doubling of water freight costs. The Shanghai Customs Brokers Association and the Foreign General Merchandise Customs Brokers, considering the current period of commercial decline and the difficulty of maintaining existing water freight rates, sent representatives to request a reduction in water freight from the companies to sustain their business. To date, no progress has been made. Yesterday at 2 PM, the six companies held a meeting at the Shipping Club. Representatives from the Shanghai Customs Brokerage industry, including Association Chairman Chen Pan Shi, and foreign general merchandise customs brokers Cao Fuyuan, Yang Zhiqing, and Dai Chen, attended the meeting. Chairman Zhi Mu from Swire was appointed to preside. The customs broker representatives presented their requests, outlining their difficulties and hoping for a reduction in water freight rates on the Yangtze River route to sustain their businesses and alleviate the suffering of merchants. However, after discussions, no concrete measures were decided upon, and the issue will be submitted for a decision at the next meeting.</p>

<p>There are still four to five hundred thousand people living without food or shelter, and the spring cold in the disaster area is severe. Although daytime temperatures reach around ten degrees Fahrenheit, they drop below freezing at night. Floods cover the land with ice, and the disaster victims live in an ice world. Furthermore, tree bark and grass roots have been exhausted. They have no place to live and no food to eat. The disaster victims are dying from starvation or freezing. Moreover, eight or nine out of ten are suffering from measles, smallpox, skin diseases, and other infectious diseases. The commission has established dozens of temporary disaster relief hospitals in Jinan, Jining, Yanzhou, Longshan, Teng County, Juye County, Wenshang, Tai'an, Fei County, Cao County, and other places. Each hospital diagnoses over a hundred people daily. Even at Qilu Hospital alone, approximately nine thousand people received medical treatment and vaccinations at various shelters in December of last year. It is evident that in addition to suffering from cold and hunger, disease is a serious problem facing the disaster victims in western Shandong. Philanthropists should find ways to save them.</p>

<p>Philanthropist Lu Bohong was sent by the fundraising committees of various provinces to inspect the drought and flood conditions in Xuzhou, Shandong, and Bengbu last month. He returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. According to him, the floodwaters in the affected areas of Shandong have not receded, and over a hundred thousand disaster victims are trapped without food or clothing, which is a dire situation. Even the shelters and temporary hospitals in Jinan are still accommodating tens of thousands of homeless disaster victims. Chairman Han is deeply concerned and has agreed to cooperate with the flood relief committees to provide assistance. After holding a spring relief meeting, it was decided that the urgent tasks are: 1. Purchasing food for March and April; 2. Purchasing plowing cattle and farm tools; 3. Repairing houses damaged by the floods; 4. Purchasing spring planting seeds, etc. The situation in Xuzhou and the proposed measures are generally similar to those in Shandong, but the disaster area is not as extensive. He then went to Bengbu and met with Father Disder of the Catholic Church and local gentry to discuss the severe drought conditions, which are no less severe than the floods in Xuzhou and Shandong, particularly in the four counties of Huo Qiu, Meng County, Ying Shang, and Fuyang. In summary, the disasters in all these places are severe and widespread. Effective relief efforts require at least one million yuan. He has sent letters to the flood relief fundraising committees and the international famine relief committees to seek assistance.</p>

<p>Lu Bohong, the general manager of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, noted that when Han Ziruo was in charge of provincial administration, he strongly supported the Zhabei privately-run water and electricity company. Although Han Ziruo declined birthday celebrations for his eightieth birthday, the company still sent a gift of one thousand yuan to be used for disaster relief in the disaster areas. They received a reply from Han stating, "I have received your letter, and I am donating the one thousand yuan given for my birthday to spring relief efforts in Xuhai. Your generosity is admirable. I, Guojun, am incompetent and have aimlessly spent eighty years. This is supposed to be the time of life to enjoy health and longevity, but considering these difficult times, it is not a time for celebration. I have already announced in the newspapers that I am declining all ceremonies. Now, I am receiving your generous gift for spring relief in Xuhai, which is a time when money is urgently needed. I will deposit the money in the name of your company at the Zhenjiang Farmers Bank for collection and transfer. I express my gratitude on behalf of the disaster victims."</p>

<p>The following subsidies for charitable organizations have been recommended to the board of directors by the finance committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The board of directors has approved the original proposal at its regular meeting the other day and included it in this year's budget. These include: The Foreign Women's Relief Society, 3,500 yuan. This year, due to the reduced relief work, the subsidy has also been reduced by 1,500 yuan compared to last year.</p>
<p>The Foreign Women's Shelter on Yulin Road. Regarding the shelter's request for subsidies, it is stated that the nature of the shelter's work is the same as that of the Foreign Women's Relief Society, which is to help foreign women in need. However, the Council's opinion is that subsidies should only be granted after the shelter has been operating for one year, and its work report and financial statements have been reviewed and approved by the Municipal Council. Before subsidies are granted, the house tax for the shelter, originally calculated at 900 yuan per year, will be temporarily reduced to 600 yuan.</p>
<p>The Liang Gong Suo and the School for the Blind. This year's subsidies remain the same, i.e., 4,900 yuan for the Liang Gong Suo and 4,200 yuan for the School for the Blind.</p>
<p>The Girl Scouts Association, 300 yuan, reduced by 120 yuan compared to last year. The following subsidies for hospitals and charities were jointly discussed by the Finance and Health Committee of the Municipal Council, recommended to the board of directors, and approved to be included in the budget. These include:</p>
<p>The Chinese Leprosy Hospital. When leprosy cases are discovered in the Public Concession, they are sent to the hospital for treatment. This year's subsidy will be capped at 1,200 yuan.</p>
<p>The Japanese Residents Group Clinic. This year, the first subsidy of 5,000 yuan is allocated. Fumin Hospital, this year, the subsidy remains the same at 500 yuan.</p>
<p>The Russian Pulmonary Tuberculosis Sanatorium, 1,000 yuan this year, an increase of 300 yuan compared to last year.</p>

<p>A Business that Corrupts Morals - Each Sentenced to a Fine of 500 Yuan</p>
<p>Lu Dagong, the Chinese head of the Lao Zha Public Concession, and Chinese detective Lang Chengpei, inspected various hotels at 10:45 PM on the 29th of last month. When they inspected room 27 of the Tongli Public Hotel at 195 Fujian Road, they found Gu A'quan from Shanghai and Yao Wenhan from Suzhou living there. After a search by the head, a large number of pornographic pictures were found in a rattan suitcase. The pictures included both Chinese and Western styles, totaling hundreds of pieces. It was indeed an organization selling pornographic pictures. Therefore, Gu and Yao were taken back to the police station and handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Yesterday, Judge Yang Qianchang reopened the criminal court for further questioning. Lawyer Jiang Baolian from the police station prosecuted them for violating public morals. Then, the head and others reported the process of the investigation. According to Gu, the pictures were deposited by a friend. Yao stated that although he had been engaged in this business before, he had reformed after being caught and punished. He had just sat down at the hotel when he was arrested. Judge Yang believed that the defendants could engage in any business, but they engaged in this business that corrupted morals and harmed young people. Unless they were severely punished, it would not be enough to deter others. Therefore, he announced the judgment, fining Gu and Yao 500 yuan each. If they chose to perform labor, it would be at a rate of three yuan per day. The pornographic pictures were confiscated.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Reasons for the Soaring Price of Soybean Oil <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>In reality, it is being manipulated by a certain party. Shanghai Oil Factories are trying to find a way to save the situation.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that soybean oil has a very wide market in China. Its main sources are Dalian, Yingkou, Niuzhuang, and other places. The three northeastern provinces are particularly rich in soybeans. In addition to transporting soybeans to various ports for sale, they are also pressed into soybean oil and sold in the interior. However, since the Northeast was occupied, all kinds of production have been manipulated, and soybean oil is inevitably monopolized. Therefore, the price of soybean oil has been soaring recently. It is understood that in the past, a large number of soybeans and soybean oil were transported from the Northeast to Shanghai. However, since last year, the soybeans produced in various parts of the Northeast have been manipulated by a certain party, and the production of soybean oil has become increasingly scarce, which has led to the soaring price of soybean oil in the country. The highest price reached 20 yuan per picul, which is 5 or 6 yuan higher than in the past. The Shanghai oil factories are running out of raw materials from the Northeast, and the domestic production is minimal, so there is no way to meet the market demand. The oil factories are now planning to find ways to save the situation, such as replacing it with rapeseed oil and raw oil. Rapeseed and peanuts are still abundant and cheap in China. If they can be used, they can both resist the manipulation of the soybean market by a certain party and meet the needs of the market.</p>

<p>Sending Representatives to Ask Premier Chiang for Assistance</p>
<p>Ningbo's silver supply is tight, and rice reserves in various rice shops are weak. This is causing concern, especially as it is between harvests. Concerned Ningbo gentry and merchants sent representatives Zhao Zhishi and Wang Wenhan to Shanghai to ask Ningbo compatriots in Shanghai to work together to find a solution. Yesterday, Yu Zuoting and Wang Wenhan convened a meeting of Ningbo compatriots in Shanghai at the Ningbo Compatriot Association to discuss solutions.

<h3 id="e135">Raw Silk and Finished Silk Industries - A Portion of the Public Assessment Has Been Decided <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that the Shanghai Raw Silk Association, since being ordered by the ministry to switch to using the municipal public foot (unit of measurement) for pricing, has been well-received by customers due to its convenience in calculation. However, at the end of February when settling accounts, customers still felt the pricing was too high. Therefore, the Silk and Satin Industry Association and the Electric Silk Weaving Factory Association, together with their affiliated associations (Zhejiang Provincial Association, Qianjiang Guild Hall, Yunjin Guild Hall, Shengjing Guild Hall, etc.), came forward to request that the Fine Weaving Association reduce the public assessment price per foot. After several meetings, the pricing for the Zhejiang Raw Silk Association's silk has been announced as follows: 3.5 fen per foot for top-grade, 3 fen for medium-grade, 2.5 fen for light-grade, and 2 fen for the lightest-grade. The Electric Silk Weaving Factory Association has also decided on a pricing of 2.5 fen per foot for grade A genuine silk/artificial silk woven goods, 2 fen for grade B, and 1.5 fen for grade C. However, the pricing for the Silk and Satin Industry Association is still under discussion. As the public assessments are being changed one after another, the fine weaving factories have no choice but to reorganize their accounts, which has been very busy in recent days. It can be said that the two industries have spared no effort to promote its success, and can be described as wiping clean for a fresh start.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Detective Tao Shiwei of the Xin Zha Police Station Uncovers the X-Ray Mirror - Under the Guise of Science, it Truly Exhibits Immorality - The Beautiful Woman Turns into a Skeleton - A Detestable Third Act <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>In general entertainment venues in Shanghai, in order to attract customers recently, in addition to various entertainment activities, they have mostly added an X-ray mirror section, saying that it uses scientific methods to see through the body and turn it into a skeleton, attracting many curious people to be tempted. Everyone wants to see it first, and the venue owner stipulates that the cost of visiting is two cents per person. In reality, the so-called scientific change is purely a deception. The other day, Detective Tao Shiwei of the Xin Zha Police Station, while inspecting the Shanghai World Entertainment Venue on Jing'an Temple Road, made a special visit to the X-ray section and carefully observed it, immediately exposing this dark secret of teaching licentiousness and defrauding money. The so-called X-ray mirror is placed in a dark room. When someone enters to view it, the manager turns on the light on one side and orders a young woman to stand behind the mirror in a yukata (bathing gown), and her graceful shadow is revealed from the mirror. This is the phenomenon of the first act. Then, the manager turns the light from bright to dark, and then immediately restores the light. In this moment, the person standing behind the mirror has been replaced by someone else, and the clothes have also been changed to only wearing a shirt and pants. However, the former faced the mirror, while this one faces the wall, so the mirror shows the back of the beautiful woman's neck, and it is impossible to see her true face. This is the change of the second act. At this time, the manager still uses the same trick, turning the light off and then on again, so that the person behind the mirror retreats and is replaced by the girl who appeared in the first act, but she is completely naked, with every detail visible. Therefore, both the performers and the audience recognize that this third act is the most exciting, but it harms public morals, especially in this act. When the audience is focused, the fourth act is performed. What appears in the mirror is a skeleton. This object is man-made, and the so-called "beautiful woman turns into a skeleton" is also the end of the viewing. However, the customers still have regrets about the fleeting glimpse of the third act, so they often shout the slogan "One more time!" Whenever the manager sees the enthusiastic requests from the audience, he orders the performing girl to sacrifice her sex appeal and repeat the act, so that the viewers can feast their eyes. Detective Tao, having discovered this secret that day, recognized the need to immediately crack down on it. In addition to joining forces with foreign detective Huierkaosi to go to the venue to order that the performance be prohibited, he also found out that among the two women who performed, the naked one was named Shi Fengying, who is 22 years old. He immediately brought her, along with the venue manager Hu Chao (named Fengxiang), to public prosecution. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang of the First Special District Court summoned them for questioning. Lawyer Jiang Baolian of the police station presented the course of events. Judge Yang stated that Shi Fengying had not yet been summoned, and after briefly questioning Hu, he ordered him to pay a 1,000 yuan deposit and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>

<p>Xue Xueling, a doctor from Wuxi at 60 Huade Road, has a daughter named Herong (13 years old) who is deaf and mute. He has employed a maid, Yao A'jin, 21 years old, from Zhenjiang for three years. Recently, A'jin suddenly had evil intentions. Between December 26 of last year and March 5 of this year, she instigated the mute young lady to steal checks from her father that were deposited at the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank in Tilanqiao, stamp them with the chop, and secretly cash them at the bank, totaling 4,325 yuan, four times, which was used up. When the case was exposed, the Huishan Police Station was notified the other day and sent Detective Ji Peijin to secretly arrest the maid Yao A'jin, seizing 59 yuan, which was taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday, she was escorted to Criminal Court Three of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Zhang from the Municipal Council stated that the defendant stole seven checks in total, and cashed them four times. Currently, one check has been found, and two are still missing. She refuses to hand them over. He requested an adjournment. Then, the victim Xue Diling stated that he received the bank's deposit slip yesterday and discovered the matter because the numbers did not match. According to the girl Herong, she used sign language to indicate that the defendant had tricked her into taking the checks to the bank to withdraw money, saying they were for shopping. She only received 20 yuan, and she does not know where the rest is hidden. When questioned, Yao A'jin claimed that she only gave Herong 59 yuan. The statement was cunning. She said she did not know about the other two missing checks. She asked for a careful investigation. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered that she be remanded in custody and the case be investigated further at a later date.</p>

<p>At 12:30 PM on January 4 of this year, six notorious robbers, Chen Zongbao, Zhao A'tang, Wang A'ming, Ni Wenming, Wu A'qing, and Mao A'yu, held guns and attempted to rob the home of Lu Renzhu at 11 Heng'anfang, Fangbang Bridge, Ximen. The detective team had learned of this beforehand and secretly dispatched several detectives in disguise to wait. When the robbers broke into Lu's home, they gave a secret signal and surrounded Lu's home. The robbers then fought like cornered beasts. Both sides opened fire, and the order was in chaos. Traffic in the area was immediately cut off. As a result, all six robbers were captured, and four pistols and fourteen bullets were seized, and they were sent to the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the local court for interrogation and detention. Detectives Bian Wenguang and Zhang Mengsheng were both shot in the legs. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the case was thoroughly investigated by Prosecutor Lei Binzhang, who filed a public prosecution. Judge Lu Wuyi opened a court for interrogation. Chen Zongbao stated that he was 35 years old, Zhao A'tang stated that he was 38 years old, and Ni Wenming stated that he was 26 years old, all from Dinghai, Ningbo. Mao A'yu stated that he was 31 years old, Wang A'ming stated that he was 32 years old, and Wu A'qing stated that he was 27 years old, all from Yuyao. All admitted to the attempted robbery. The day before yesterday afternoon, an order was issued to sentence the six criminals Chen Zongbao and others to ten years of imprisonment each. After the sentencing, they were returned to custody. Yesterday morning, the Lao Zha Police Station ordered Chinese and Western detectives to take a document to the local court, requesting that the above six criminals be transferred because the police station had recently captured a bandit leader who confessed that he and the six criminals had committed several robberies in the concession and urgently needed to be questioned. Judge Lu Hongyi opened a court and ordered that the six criminals be brought to the case and handed over to the visiting officers to be taken away. They will be returned for execution after the concession robbery case is concluded.</p>

<p>Zhang Hongzhao, the manager of Ren Ren Tang Pharmacy at 197 Tongfu Road, suddenly received a threatening letter delivered by gangsters on January 12th of this year. The letter was signed by the "Minduo Righteous Courage Corps," and its main content stated that the corps was short of military funds and requested a subsidy of 5,000 yuan, to be discussed at the French Park. Zhang ignored the letter after receiving it. On the morning of January 16th, a person suddenly came to the Chengdu Road branch of Ren Ren Tang, pretending to buy medicine. They carried a paper box, took out a prescription, and after the medicine was prepared, the person suddenly claimed they didn't have enough money and hurriedly left, intentionally leaving the paper box behind. Later, the shop assistants opened it and found a bomb inside, as well as a threatening letter to Zhang Hongzhao. The letter said, "We sent a letter earlier, but you ignored it. Now we are giving you another warning. If you still don't comply, we will kill your two sons," etc. The branch reported to the manager of the main store, who then reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station. Detectives were sent to investigate and took the bomb and letter back to the police station. After taking photos of the bomb, it was deemed unsuitable to store such a dangerous item for long, so it was destroyed in conjunction with the Water Police Station. Unexpectedly, the pharmacy then received two more letters, demanding a meeting at a room in the Dajiangnan Hotel on Fujian Road. The police station sent detectives, along with Zhang's representative, Si Kunsheng, to wait, but no gangsters appeared. It wasn't until 4:15 PM yesterday that the Chengdu Road Police Station's Chinese Detective Chief Feng Baishun, Detective Chen Yaoting, Zhang Liansheng, etc., arrested Cai Jingming (also known as Juan Xiu), a Tianjin native, on Xinzha Bridge Road. He was taken to the police station. According to Cai's confession, all the threatening letters were written by him alone. He also led the detectives to 1198 Huade Road, where they arrested another accomplice, Zhong Heng (also known as Zhong Peheng), a Jiangyin native. He was taken to the police station and detained. This morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated the case according to criminal law, saying that the defendant Cai Jingming confessed at the police station that the Minduo Righteous Courage Corps was formed by him and four other fugitives: Wang Youzhi, Miao Kunyuan, Lin Bao, etc. The letter was signed by the corps' secretary, Yao Ming, and all four threatening letters were written by him alone. Zhong Heng used to work at the Ren Ren Tang pharmacy and was fired on January 29th of this year. His older brother is also a shareholder, so he knew the inside information. Currently, Wu Baojin, a shop assistant at the branch, and Wang Xingyu, an accountant, can identify Cai Jingming as the person who placed the bomb at the time. Furthermore, this case still requires investigation and handwriting comparison, so a request was made for a postponement. According to Si Kunsheng, the representative assistant of Ren Ren Tang, Cai Jingming confessed that he wrote the letter, but the matter was initiated by Wang Youzhi and led by Miao Shenyuan. The bomb was initially sent to the main store by Lin Shi, but because Lin knew a shop assistant there, he didn't dare to leave it and later sent me to deliver it to the branch. When questioned, Zhong Heng's statements were vague. Judge Liu Yukui reviewed the confessions and ordered the two defendants to be detained for a further hearing next Wednesday. [There was also a case of a kidnapped child: "A seven-year-old boy, named Ruihai, from Tongzhou, did not know Yuan, but was abducted by him. The official reported to the Water Police Station, and detectives Xu Lenian and Yao Guofa arrived and arrested Yuan Shihong and Yuan Xu's wife, a child abductor, and the abducted child. It was learned that the child lived at 181 Gansidong Road, and his father, Li Zhengsuo, earned a living by pulling rickshaws. On March 1, the child was playing at the door and was seen by the abductor, who gave the child a banana candy and a sesame ball to eat. Taking advantage of the opportunity, he took the child into his arms and left. Li Zhengsuo's wife had attempted suicide several times after losing the child, but was rescued and survived. Yesterday morning, the customs officer went to inform him, and Li Zhengsuo could not help but dance with joy and rejoice that the pearl was returned. They went to the police station together to confirm that there was no error. In the afternoon, on the order of the court, they were transferred to the local court for interrogation. Later, after an interrogation by Prosecutor Tang, Yuan Shihong and Yuan Xu's wife were ordered to be detained for further action, and the child was handed over to his father to reunite."].</p>

<p>Gao Bao, a 39-year-old woman from Suzhou, was previously married to Gao Shi, a wealthy Teochew merchant and head comprador of Taikoo Yanghang, as a concubine. Gao Shi died in July 1933, and his position was inherited by his son, Gao Yonglian, who can earn tens of thousands of yuan a year, resulting in a very extravagant lifestyle. However, he provides no support for the daily life of his concubine mother, Bao. Therefore, Bao hired lawyer Ma Lewu to file a lawsuit with the Second Special Court, requesting a court order for living expenses. When questioned, the defendant said, "I acknowledge that the plaintiff is my concubine mother, but we do not live together." The judge ordered bailiffs to investigate the defendant's residence at 10, Lane 177, Luban Road. The case was postponed for further verification. The bailiffs confirmed that the plaintiff and defendant did live together. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Li Liang heard the case in the Seventh Court. The defendant was not present, only his lawyer, Tao Yimin, appeared. The plaintiff, Gao Bao, appeared with her lawyer, Ma Lewu. According to Bao, her husband has been dead for three years. She lives upstairs in the defendant's house. Although she has food to eat, she has no vegetables and must provide them herself. Her daily treatment is very harsh. She even pawns her clothes to make a living, and she has pawn tickets to prove it. Lawyer Ma stated that Mr. Xu Yubo previously mediated the case, and the defendant was to pay the plaintiff 30 yuan per month for living expenses. However, the defendant initially paid it but stopped after a few months, and nothing has been paid for two years. When Gao Shi was alive, he had a will that his sons must support their concubine mother. The defendant earns 500 to 600 yuan a month and only cares about his own extravagance, leaving his concubine mother behind. He is unfaithful and unfilial. He should be ordered to pay the plaintiff 60 yuan per month for living expenses, calculated for ten years. The judge said that the plaintiff requested 60 yuan per month for ten years, totaling 7,200 yuan, but the plaintiff only paid four yuan in court fees and still owes a large sum. The plaintiff's lawyer said that the calculation should be for five years. The judge said that the amount also needs to be supplemented. The defendant's lawyer, Tao, said that the plaintiff lives in the defendant's house and all food, etc., is provided by the defendant. Furthermore, the defendant's father had shares in the Atlantic Restaurant to give to the plaintiff. In addition, the plaintiff has another residence in Danshui Road and had an affair with a Mr. Yang. Judge Li Liang adjourned the case and scheduled a further hearing on the afternoon of the 13th of this month, at which time the defendant must personally appear for questioning.</p>

<p>Weng Kelong, the 15-year-old son of Weng Jingqing, the owner of the Dehe Pawnshop at 366 Qiwu Pei Road, was kidnapped on the morning of December 10th last year at about 8:00 AM while traveling with his older sister, Huiying, in a private chartered car to Jianhai Middle School on Jingzhou Road. The driver of the Lili car hired by the bandits, Han Yueqing, was also shot and killed by the bandits. The case was not resolved until the morning of February 22nd of this year, when Lu Liankui, the inspector of the criminal division of the Public Concession Police Department, Chinese Detective Chief Wang Chengying, and Xu Zhaoyuan, the captain of the First Squad of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Division, rushed to the Yu Family Garden on Xiangyin Road in Zhabei and arrested eight suspects, including the kidnappers Dong Xuezeng, Zhang Sheng, the gardener Dong Da, Dong's wife Zhu, and his mother-in-law Zhu Han. Firearms and ammunition were found, and the kidnap victim was rescued on the spot. Inspector Lu, based on the confessions of the gangsters about the whereabouts of their accomplices, raided Jiajiage No. 138, Yangjing Town, Pudong, at around 1:00 AM yesterday, and arrested Zhao Junda, also known as Zhao Maolin, 26, from Yancheng, and Tang Yaodong, 46, from Huaicheng. After they were brought back, Tang confessed that there were accomplices named Xia Qichang, etc., hiding at Tianda Bridge, Tanziwan, Zhabei. Therefore, at around 5:00 PM, the original team of Chinese and Western detectives, along with police officer Jiang Shulin dispatched from the Xinzha Branch, went to cooperate. However, Xia had fled upon hearing the news. Only a photo of Xia and a red wine label were found in his home and taken to the bureau. Wang Yuanren, the acting branch chief, ordered them to be handed over to the detectives for further investigation and handling.</p>

<p>The Shanghai South Office of the Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry Association, in view of the fact that most of its members are small businesses and women's stores with limited business knowledge, and therefore most of the goods they sell are brought to their doors by street vendors, often being deceived and fined for detention by the tax bureau, issued an emergency notice yesterday to protect its members from being penalized, saying, "Informing you, in recent times, various agencies have been rigorously inspecting and penalizing counterfeit goods and tax evasion. We hereby notify you so that everyone is aware. The key points of the inspection include the following three items, which are listed in detail below: Recently, several cases have been discovered of various counterfeit brand matches, cigarettes, and cigars being sold door-to-door and seized and penalized by the tax bureau. All our members should pay attention and refuse to sell goods sold door-to-door to avoid being deceived, implicated, and penalized. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau will soon send uniformed police officers to conduct a spring inspection of stamp tax. The ledgers, account books, and all other contracts and evidence used by member stores should be fully stamped according to the new regulations, and the stamps must be covered with a overlapping seal to avoid omissions or short stamps, which will result in fines. The Municipal Social Bureau's Bureau of Weights and Measures will soon conduct a general inspection. All member stores should pay attention to purchasing weights and measures (scales, rulers, bushels, pecks, hanging scales, etc.) that have been inspected by the bureau and stamped with a hard stamp. The use of any uninspected items is prohibited. If discovered, you will be summoned and fined by the court. Please pay attention to the above three items and do not neglect them to your own detriment. This is an important notice."</p>

<h3 id="e147">The Tragic Fate of Smokers <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>My friend Mr. Zhou, who was talented in his youth and unconventional, has been addicted to opium for nearly twenty years. Although his ancestors left him a small amount of land that could barely be farmed, he was unable to manage it well and almost sold it all, leading to his wife's departure and his daughter's prostitution. Now he is destitute and has nowhere to return. I remember more than ten years ago, I strongly advised him to quickly take Feng's "Save the Suffering Golden Pill" to quit smoking as early as possible, but he did not wake up and drifted along. Yesterday, I heard from a friend that he has become a beggar, running around the streets all day, begging for pity, without shame. Hearing this, I couldn't help but feel sad. If he had taken Feng's "Save the Suffering Golden Pill" to quit smoking earlier, he wouldn't have fallen to this point. Although he is to blame for his own fate, how many people in the world are like Mr. Zhou? I still hope that fellow opium addicts will wake up as soon as possible, be determined to quit, and avoid endless regrets.</p>
<p>Smoking opium and red pills causes one to be despised and abandoned by relatives and friends. Why bring disgrace upon oneself?</p>
<p>Smoking opium and red pills leads to economic insolvency. Why look for trouble?</p>
<p>Smoking opium and red pills violates national criminal law. Why throw oneself into the legal net?</p>
<p>Smoking opium and red pills harms physical health. Why hasten one's death?</p>
<p>Using valuable and useful money to buy illegal and harmful drugs is truly the world's number one fool. Gentlemen of the opium dens can wake up now! Feng's "Save the Suffering Golden Pill" was invented in the seventh year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty and has been around for sixty-nine years. No less than millions of people have taken this pill to quit opium, red pills, morphine, heroin, and other drug addictions. When quitting, one can smoke as usual, and the desire for smoke will decrease naturally every day. For mild cases, one or two doses are enough, and for severe cases, four or five doses. Take the medicine once every night before going to bed, and you will feel comfortable and pain-free, without vomiting or diarrhea, and without interfering with official business. After taking the medicine, the medicinal power will help to clear the stagnation of smoke, moisten the intestines, and nourish yin, so that the amount of smoke will naturally decrease every day. It can also break the habit of addiction and push the time of addiction back day by day. In a short time, you will completely quit without realizing it. Everyone is satisfied, and those who quit send letters of thanks every day. The general hall welcomes visitors. Feng's "Save the Suffering Golden Pill" has been praised by former Presidents Li, Xu, and Cao, praised by Chairman Zhang of the Central Anti-Opium Commission, and praised by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Tianjin Anti-Drug Association. Customs and post offices have no restrictions. In addition to the above honors, even doctors in anti-smoking institutions in various places use this pill to help people quit smoking and have achieved good results. Each dose is one and a half yuan, and the mailing fee is one yuan. A shortcut to quit smoking is available upon request.

<p>Yesterday, a letter was sent to the French Concession Taxpayer Association requesting them to negotiate with the French Municipal Council to abolish the tax.</p>
<p>The Fenjiu Industry Association of this city believes that the sudden increase in stall taxes by the French Concession Council hinders commercial development. Yesterday, it sent a letter to the French Concession Chinese Taxpayer Association, requesting them to negotiate and request the abolition of stall taxes in order to maintain the industry's livelihood. The original letter stated, "To whom it may concern, according to the reports from our members Xinsheng Wine Shop, Renji Kanghou Wine Shop, Dade Wine Shop, etc., regarding the application, our members have been operating in the French Concession for many years. Now that the market is depressed and business losses are very large, it is difficult to maintain. Suddenly, we received a letter from the Taxation Department of the French Concession Council stating that, starting in February of the lunar calendar, each household must pay an additional third of the stall tax. Our members directly negotiated to no avail and had no choice but to request the general assembly to transfer the negotiation in order to reduce the burden and maintain business. The situation is extremely urgent, etc., to the association. Based on this, it has been found that the market is depressed, and all industries are sluggish. Our members are generally small-scale businesses and are already difficult to maintain at ordinary times. How can we add additional donations to increase the burden? This is the real situation. This matter concerns the issue of Chinese taxpayers. In addition to our association directly asking the French Concession Council to exempt the increase, we should ask your association to provide strong support for the citizens in the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation and negotiate on our behalf to avoid the increase. Our members will be truly grateful. A corresponding letter is sent to your association, hoping that you will check and inform us of the handling situation. After receiving this request, the association sent staff to the Fenjiu Industry Association and various Fenjiu shops to conduct on-site investigations on the business situation and tax rates of the Fenjiu industry, etc., in order to have a basis for submitting a negotiation to the French Concession Council, requesting its abolition."</p>

<p>Complete Relocation by the End of June This Year, No New Construction Allowed for Unrelocated "Bing She"</p>

<p>New Scam in the Western District of Shanghai, Extorting Money Under False Pretenses, Truly Despicable</p>
<p>Zhang Bin Chen, Li Gen Sheng, Lu Lian Yuan, and other three people from Hebei have no legitimate occupation and live by extortion. Recently, they came up with a far-fetched idea, falsely claiming that a friend had died, leaving behind family members with no funds to return home. They then went around soliciting travel expenses from residents. Many families in the western district of Shanghai have been fooled. Yesterday morning at 11 AM, these fellows went to the Shanghai Dairy Farm milk stall on Jinyi Road, Zhongshan Road, to solicit donations for travel expenses. After being refused by the stall, they refused to leave and made intimidating remarks. The stall sounded the whistle for help. Soldiers from the 6th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the Security Corps stationed there heard the sound and went to investigate. After learning the details, they arrested Zhang, Li, and Lu and sent them to the Xujiahui Police Station. Director Yi is currently preparing a proposal. During the preliminary hearing, the owner of the Xiefeng Fish Shop on Zhongshan Road reported to the station that he had also been extorted three dollars by the suspects the day before. When questioned, Zhang Bin Chen and others gave evasive answers. Director Yi, considering that these fellows are unemployed vagrants who dare to extort money under false pretenses, which is extremely illegal, ordered that a document be prepared immediately and sent to the bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>The Chinese and Portuguese football teams will compete in the final at Yiyuan at 3 PM this afternoon to decide this year's Shanghai International Cup football championship. This is Shanghai's largest and most eye-catching championship.</p>
<p>The Chinese football team has won the championship three times in a row in 1930, 1931, and 1935. The Portuguese team has also won the championship before, but has not realized its desire to win the cup in recent sessions. This season, the team is very strong, so there will definitely be a fierce competition and a fascinating game.</p>
<p>Previously, due to a minor dispute, Marseille and Le Métayer, two inter-city players, were excluded from the Portuguese team. Now, due to various difficulties, they have been re-invited to join the Portuguese team. However, only Le Métayer will be seen in today's game. Marseille injured his knee in the charity cup game against the Chinese team and has not recovered, and is still under medical treatment.</p>
<p>The injury of Portuguese center Corazza has already caused Portugal to forfeit the Scota Cup. Whether he can play today is still uncertain. However, in any case, the team is a dangerous factor for the Chinese team. The Chinese team is composed of the elite of the Tung Wah and Youlian teams. Although the call for victory is very high, an unexpected result is not difficult to occur. The Chinese team members will do their best to keep the International Cup in China.</p>

<p>The final week of the first round of the eighth Western Youth Volleyball League took place last night. Because the China Youth team withdrew, the game between that team and Mai Ling was canceled. Therefore, there was only one game last night, between Hai Qing and Western Youth. It was expected that Western Youth's skills were mediocre and could not withstand a single blow from Hai Qing. Last night, except for the second game, where Western Youth was able to rally slightly, the other two games saw Hai Qing's imposing manner and became one-sided. As a result, 15-4, 15-9, and 15-1, Hai Qing won a straight three sets and Western Youth suffered a major defeat. Hai Qing won four games in four and holds the top spot in the first round. The second round is scheduled to begin on the 9th of this month. The details of last night's game and today's schedule are listed below:</p>
<p>Hai Qing Takes the Lead</p>
<p>At 7:30, the two Western Youth teams began contact. Hai Qing served first and immediately scored one point. Zheng Mai quickly smashed the ball, taking a遥遙 lead of 6-0. Seeing that the situation was not good, Western Youth actively resisted. Burton made a leaping shot and regained one point. Hai Qing’s Grey responded in kind. Zheng Mai made several out-of-bounds shots, and Western Youth sat and won two cities. After 9-4, Hai Qing's momentum greatly increased, and they played smoothly.

<h3 id="e189">Ministry of Education Circular: Increase Funding for Volunteer and Vocational Education; Report to the Ministry Before May 15; The Central Government Will Allocate Subsidies <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 6th) The Ministry of Education issued a circular to all education departments on the 6th, stating that volunteer and vocational education should be regarded as the central work for the next year, and the following items should be followed when preparing the budget for the 25th year:</p>
<p>Increase funding for volunteer education, aiming to increase it by more than double compared to the previous year. In the future, the continued allocation and increased allocation of central subsidies will be proportional to the actual amount of funding expansion for this cause in each province.</p>
<p>Increase funding for vocational education, striving to expand it according to the ratio of the previous year, so as to reach the proportion of vocational education funding within the time limit. Provincial governments should also be consulted to seek implementation. Each department must draft an implementation plan and list the exact amount of increased funding and report it to the Ministry for review before May 15.</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 6th) The central government approved a subsidy of 2.4 million yuan for compulsory education funding in the previous year, plus 500,000 yuan for border education funding and 300,000 yuan for subsidies from the Gengkuan (Boxer Indemnity) organization, totaling 3.2 million yuan. The Ministry of Education distributed the funds to various provinces and cities. Due to the establishment of volunteer schools, the cost was huge, and local fiscal revenue was limited. It is requested that the funding be increased appropriately starting from the next year. Recently, the Ministry of Education sent personnel to inspect vocational and volunteer education and deeply felt the lack of funding. It has again ordered the central government to increase the subsidy for the next year in order to promote it. As for the volunteer education plans of various provinces and cities, the Ministry has ordered the provincial and municipal governments to prepare them and submit them to the Ministry for review.</p>

<p>"I must be careful; but everyone eats so much, I think I’ll just do my best." said Teddy, still inclined to that common notion that Thanksgiving is about eating almost to the point of stroke, or at least a stomachache or headache.</p>
<p>Everyone had been sitting for a long time, and at the end, they each toasted each other's health with apple cider, then stood up and dispersed. Mrs. Brooke then said to them, "Now, my darlings, you may play quietly, because there will be a big celebration tonight."</p>
<p>Mr. Brooke said, "I want to take my whole team for a ride in the carriage; that would be very enjoyable. You can rest at home, dear, or you'll be too tired tonight." After they put on their coats and hats, filled a large carriage to the brim, they immediately set off for a long and pleasant excursion, leaving Mrs. Brooke at home to rest and quietly do a few small things.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange saw an increasingly sluggish market, completely sideways. Trading was still extremely quiet, market price fluctuations were increasingly small, the time spent on each market was increasingly short, and the number of people attending meetings was even more sparse. The market was idle. Because the market price was leveled, it could be implemented at any time, and sellers naturally decreased. Buyers held on to the principle of current interest, and would not enter unless prices were low. As a result of mutual observation, the market tended to move sideways. Yesterday's transactions saw only No. 72 slightly buying in, and the rest were only scattered transactions. The opening was slightly higher by two or three jiao, and the second market immediately tended to be sluggish, with only five fen or one jiao fluctuations. Transactions were clearest in the second market. The afternoon opening saw No. 72 continue to have needs, but the number was not large. Sentiment slightly weakened, and market prices slightly weakened by one or two jiao. The closing rebounded slightly. Considering the increase in public bond chips, market prices should have trended smaller, but the environment, due to the equipment of the Stabilization Committee, made the shorts wary. The previous pull whenever it was small could be a lesson. Therefore, they waited for an opportunity to move. Yesterday's market price resulted in a slight rebound of about two or three jiao. 96 rose by four jiao. The total number of transactions was 2,765,000 yuan. The results of its rise and fall are compared and listed on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit hundred yuan).</p>

<p>Recent Drop of One Yuan</p>
<p>The yarn market is calm, and the situation is peaceful again. The yarn stored in warehouses is still outside of 27,000 bales. This cotton yarn lacks liquidity, and the sellers' intention to dump is still present, so the pressure is increasing. Spot yarn sales are slightly dull, so the market is ordinary. However, the cotton market is firm, and the yarn market is rising with it.</p>

It was found that Dafu sold 750 bales, Feng 850 bales, Sen Kang 1,300 bales, Shen Ji 950 bales, Da Chang Cheng 400 bales, Yong Chang 450 bales, Tong He 700 bales, Jin Chang 400 bales, Ming De 400 bales, Da 650 bales.

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with good news from Liverpool. Foreign firms and fellow traders bought, and each month rose by one to five pounds. The government did not close out the March longs, and there were not many who bought and hoarded cotton while hedging. New trading was lacking, and fellow traders waited for a detailed explanation of the new farmland case. Spot cotton needs were mostly of an urgent nature. The closing was firm, with spot prices rising by four pounds and futures ranging from unchanged to rising by seven pounds. British cotton spot prices rose by one point, and futures rose by five or six points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (5th telegram).</p>

<p>About 50 Yuan Difference Per Dan</p>
<p>Therefore, Transactions in Foreign Firms Are Still Rare</p>
<p>The Shanghai silk market has had a turnaround recently. User transactions can be called active, and prices have been brisk for a week. However, foreign trade is still sluggish due to the stagnation of European and American markets. The domestic and foreign silk prices are about 50 yuan apart per dan, so deals are rare, it is said.</p>

<p>Today, customers in various ports need to purchase flannel, and the price has soared by more than six or seven jiao per yard. Because not much new flannel has arrived in Shanghai, and the existing inventory has declined, the market is unusually lacking in goods. And when the sellers see that sales are quite strong, they all shout higher prices. Especially the grade between four yuan and five yuan is particularly brisk. Those in the industry and Western clothing tailors with sharp eyes are mostly secretly searching and absorbing, anticipating that the summer weather will turn hot, and this goods will surely become even more expensive. Currently, white and gray plain flannels are mostly considered rare goods.</p>

<p>Wheat Transactions are Also Very Quiet</p>
<p>The flour market opened this morning and remained weak. The quoted price for foreign wheat, Chicago, had fluctuations of one dime, and Canada was only slightly above four to eight cents. The market sentiment is that although the inventory is not very large, actual sales have shown little improvement. Business in Tianjin is only about 20-30% of what it was at its peak three to five years ago. Therefore, supply is not high, and demand has also decreased invisibly. This is evidence of the decline of both rural areas and the economy. The market fluctuations are also due to this. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, trading was even lighter, with prices for each month fluctuating by about one cent. Observing future trends, there may be several more rounds of fluctuations.</p>

<p>There have been no recent transactions in the wheat market. New wheat for June and later months is being compared on a large scale. Moreover, the trend for foreign wheat, due to the European war, is such that there are slight declines. Compared to the closing prices of the previous days, prices have fallen by five to six cents. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, only June and July had transactions, and the rest were not open. The prices were similar to those in the morning. The current wheat market has limited arrivals, only about 500 to 600 bags, and the price is still 5.22 to 5.23 yuan.</p>

Therefore, the thin rice market has shown a promising trend, with prices increasing by five cents. Thick early japonica rice is selling at a normal rate, and prices have stabilized. Duyang sharp rice has no market, and Yinyuan rice has no good or bad performance.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were about eighty to ninety boats from the river.

<p>Yesterday, new Customer Xian rice arrived, still loaded from ports such as Jiujiang. However, the owners are pushing prices up due to high costs, and sales are still active. Mainland, South Shanghai, and local hoarders continue to inquire. Hoarders' intentions are very firm, and actual sales in this area are also strong. The market is gradually increasing by about one dime. Currently, market sentiment in various regions is optimistic. Even production areas along the Yangtze River lack hope of recovery. Therefore, if sales remain strong today and tomorrow, market prices will still need to be increased. Daily sales included 2,300 bags of rice, 2,623 bags of Wental rice, 300 bags of Shaoxing rice, and 500 bags of rice, with prices being half a dime higher than last month.</p>

<p>South Seas Businesses are Actively Purchasing Doudou Sha Huang</p>
<p>Recently, the soybean market has been firm and stable due to oil prices and thin inventories. There are only about 30,000 to 40,000 bags of soybeans from various carloads, and the supply is also scattered, with no whole batches arriving. Therefore, although Dalian reported a decline, the market atmosphere in this area remains resistant to decline. The overall situation is still quite stable. Yesterday, two carloads of Bengbu soybeans were sold at a price of 4.78 yuan, and five carloads of Tongliao soybeans from roads were sold at prices ranging from 5 yuan to 4.98 yuan. South Seas businesses are very actively purchasing Doudou Sha Huang. Yesterday, 1,600 to 1,700 bags were sold. The market situation is that high-quality goods are quite strong, and medium and lower-quality goods are increasingly stable.</p>

<p>Recently, peach kernels have been in short supply, and production prices have been rising, resulting in an exceptionally firm market. According to investigations, the inventory in the Shanghai market is also low, and the sales season is still long, so the trend is very tight. Yesterday, good quality goods were already at 49 yuan, goods at 48 yuan, and ordinary goods at 35-36 yuan. The market is still expected to rise.</p>

<p>The quality of the goods is inferior… Opening at 21.9 yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable. The guild quoted 22.3 yuan for current goods of No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar, up five cents, with some transactions. Transshipment goods were at 7.1 yuan, with limited availability. Dong Chi Bai had no changes. The local factory's cotton white sugar was stable, with little fluctuation. Chaobang quoted 10.4 yuan for top-grade Qing sugar and 10.1-10.2 yuan for yellow sugar, with a total of 400 bags sold. Also, Fanchi was at 13.5 yuan to 11.8 yuan, with more than 200 bags sold. In addition, full-weight ice white sugar was at 19.4 yuan, with several dozen bags sold. However, it was heard that the numbered stores received telegrams from Shantou stating that the bill of exchange suddenly decreased by more than 20 yuan, so the cost increased by about two dimes invisibly, and the market is expected to tighten.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the deadline for bidding and exchange for the Sugar Industry Cooperative. A total of 3,750 bags of Five Sheep coarse white sugar were at 22.1 yuan, up five cents, with 350 bags sold. In addition, the first batch of Quxi factory's coarse white sugar was 3,300 bags, with the quality being relatively poor. The price was two dimes lower, at 21.9 yuan, with 1,000 bags sold. No. 2 Five Sheep cotton white sugar was 88 bags at 21.1 yuan, and No. 4 was another 10 bags at 20.9 yuan, with no changes.</p>

<p>— He Boxiong</p>
<p>Shanghai is the commercial center of the country and the main hub for financial allocation. Since the gap between the silver price in Shanghai and the silver price abroad has widened daily, it has been quite profitable to transport silver for export (see the sections on "Foreign Exchange" and "Spot Silver Reserves and Silver Movement" later). Therefore, various foreign merchant banks have been transporting large amounts of silver for export, resulting in a daily tightening of silver in Shanghai. In December of the 23rd year, the highest rate reached six dimes. In January of last year, the interbank lending rate carried on the tight momentum of the previous month and remained firm, with the highest rate being five dimes and five cents. This was because the closing period was near, various industries were replenishing their positions, and there was a demand for funds due to the delivery of public bonds and the year-end cash settlement. Finally, the China, Central, and Communications Banks released 10 million yuan to maintain the market, and the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee also purchased a large amount of spot silver for shipment to Shanghai. By the second half of the month, the situation gradually became peaceful. February was the beginning of the Lunar New Year. Based on past experience, the interbank lending rate in this month should have been extremely low, often referred to as "white paper." However, it opened at two cents at the beginning of the month and suddenly rose to one dime and one cent on the 13th. From the 20th, the foreign market resumed full-day operations, and the situation eased slightly. In March, the interbank lending rate remained at eight to nine cents throughout the month. The financial stagnation was such that the highest rate was nine cents, the lowest was six cents, and the average was eight cents. Adding water to the base rate, except for a rate above one dime at the end of the month, most were also white paper. The situation of apparent ease and hidden tightness had not changed slightly. In early April, the interbank lending market was extremely stable. The interbank lending rate opened at one dime in the early part of the month and gradually increased after the middle part of the month. This was because the long-term loans from "April" were about to expire, and there were not many people actually repaying the loans. Therefore, the interbank lending rate showed an upward trend and reached two dimes by the end of the month. In May, the interbank lending rate, in the first and middle ten days of the month, was stagnant due to the lack of improvement in the commercial market and the financial stagnation. From the 24th, due to the stranding of banks such as Minghua and Meifeng, the base rate soared to as high as three dimes and eight cents. The interbank lending rate ranged from one dime and six cents to one dime and eight cents. The urgency of the situation was no less than that of the Spring Festival in early February and the difficulties at the end of April. June began with the Lunar Dragon Boat Festival and ended with the mid-year closing period, so the finance in this month was particularly tight. In addition, at a time when finance was depleted and panic was rising, the interbank lending rate remained at one dime and eight cents in the first half of the month. In the second half of the month, due to the annual year-end closing of banks and the need to clear transactions between colleagues, the market atmosphere became even more tense, and the interbank lending rate stabilized at two dimes. In July, the interbank lending rate was two dimes throughout the month, except for one dime and eight cents on the 21st. The market atmosphere was exceptionally quiet. In August, the interbank lending rate remained at two dimes in the first and middle ten days of the month, and then gradually decreased in the last ten days, from two dimes to one dime and eight cents, and finally stabilized at one dime and five cents. This was because the financial situation in Shanghai had gradually stabilized in this month, and after the silver and money industry agreed that the China and Communications Banks would stop drawing in, the finance became more and more bland. In September, the interbank lending rate was low, with the average for the whole month being only one dime, three cents and seven mils, a decrease of slightly less than five cents compared to the previous month. The reason for this was that the market gradually stabilized. Even the difficulties of the Mid-Autumn Festival did not show any flaws. In October, the average was one dime and four cents, and the market atmosphere still did not improve. In November, since the reform of the new currency system, the interbank lending rate in the silver and money market in Shanghai has been easing daily. It opened at two dimes at the beginning of the month and had fallen to one dime and two cents by the 15th. Afterwards, it stabilized at one dime and five cents, and then slightly increased at the end of the month. This was because, after the implementation of the new currency system, the issuance of legal tender was more relaxed than before, and the China, Central, and Communications Banks also slightly relaxed their lending to the market. Therefore, the interest rate eased (to be continued).</p>

<p>Women's Special Issue</p>
<h3 id="e219">Married Working Women <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Bolin</p>
<p>In recent years, due to economic panic and the difficulty of living, the involvement of married women in the professional front has indeed been a very significant and noteworthy trend. However, on the employer's side, the primary condition for employment is almost always being single, and during layoffs, married women are laid off first. As a result, the insecurity and dissatisfaction of working women are increasing daily.</p>
<p>No matter how you put it, young women with minimal living burdens often lack enthusiasm for their jobs. Even during disputes, although they may be enthusiastic for a while, they cannot permanently maintain their interest in organized movements. However, if the number of people who remain in their positions after marriage continues to increase, women's organizations will become permanent, and their movements will be more active. The foreign example of the heated discussion of the issue of married working women most clearly proves this point.</p>
<p>Last July, the issue was also raised at the Women's Congress of the Belgian Socialist Party held in Brussels, and pregnant women put forward demands that their jobs not be taken away, that they be given special convenience for rest, medical care, or nursing, and that those who have unemployed husbands or unmarried mothers-in-law be regarded as heads of households, and that family allowances be paid to their dependents. Furthermore, women's labor does not threaten men's jobs in any case, and they demonstrate equal or even greater efficiency, but their wages are always lower than men's. They used various facts to prove this and demanded equal pay for equal work. In Belgium, the initial salaries and promotion rates of male and female teachers were originally equal, but they were abolished after the current cabinet was established. However, based on these movements, they were restored last summer.</p>
<p>At the British Labor Party Women's Congress held last June, calls were also made to defend the labor rights of married working women, with equal pay and the protection of the status and health of pregnant women being the focus of the issue.</p>
<p>The layoff of married women is making people with extremely heavy living burdens become victims. And as a result of replacing them with younger, cheaper people, only the wages of women are lowered and their treatment worsened. The defense against this has similarly become the work of the proletariat in various countries.</p>
<h3 id="e220">The Current Situation of Japanese Working Women <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Manzhi</p>
<p>Except for Sundays and special holidays, every morning there are groups of young women busily walking to their workplaces. There, machines, paperwork, and all kinds of busy work are waiting for them. Salaries are waiting for them. The rewards of a working life are expanding their freedom. This bright professional life attracts them with one hundred percent of its magic.</p>
<p>Girls who once fantasized about the happiness of married life as a sweet dream lived in the wait to be wives and mothers. Their eyes were only looking inward—toward the family. But now, as soon as they step into real life, their past dreams shatter like bubbles.</p>
<p>Women are constantly advancing on the professional front, and they are experiencing the taste of life in a non-parasitic, independent life. But everyone understands that the professional life of modern women is being developed for the benefit of employers. Even if millions of women are employed, it cannot be considered that the world of women has been opened up and they have entered the door to happiness. For example, the labor conditions in Japan's major industries, silk and textile factories, are criticized as being very bad in the world. The job of selling tickets on buses is very harmful to the female sexual function, and this is often pointed out by general intellectuals. However, the number of women employed is increasing day by day. General banks, companies, stores, etc. are all greatly employing them because women's labor is cheap and can be used cheaply at any time. Not only are married people not dismissed, but there is also a large increase in the number of people who continue to work for a long time, and they have to add a little salary. For example, a telephone operator starts with only eight dimes a day and gradually increases to a monthly salary of forty yuan, fifty yuan, or even eighty yuan, and they are still allowed to continue working.</p>
<p>But in recent years, most of the jobs that women can participate in are mechanical and auxiliary labor that does not require much skill. There is no need for skilled workers who have worked for a long time. Therefore, employers are carrying out a great metabolism, often approaching the work of novices with new interest—new and cheaper workers are what they demand. In this way, in recent years, the issue of the retirement age for working women has been raised.</p>
<p>In Bank A, since the tenth year of Showa, the retirement age for female employees has been reduced from forty-five to thirty years old. In the past, they used to get a raise every year, but now they only get one every other year, and the rate of pay raises has also been reduced to less than two-thirds. Bank B, Bank C, and Company D all have a retirement age of thirty, while Bank E and the bus company even stipulate that the retirement age is twenty-five. (This only applies to clerks and maids, while servants still have a retirement period of twenty years.) Although women are at the height of their working ability at the age of twenty-five or thirty, the ax of retirement is driving them out of the workplace. Women who were welcomed in all workplaces as players in modern industrial society are now being suppressed by the retirement age of thirty.</p>
<p>"Everywhere, I hear people complain. Is this my world?" said Songzi Guanyin to Shan'e.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>In some places, even if there is no retirement system, they are dismissed because they are married. Even if the matter of marriage is let go, there are many cases where they are dismissed because they are pregnant or giving birth. This is the case in Bank F, Bank G, and Company H. There are also places where "maternity leave" regulations are set, and because there are such regulations that they cannot dismiss married people, they use other methods to dismiss them. Such tragic phenomena can be seen everywhere.</p>
<p>For factory workers, there is legal special protection before and after childbirth. They can receive 60% of their wages during the six-week rest period. In addition, under the application of the Health Insurance Law, they can receive a maternity allowance of 20 yuan. Female teachers also have six weeks of rest before and after childbirth according to the Ministry of Education Order, but the rate of married women in working women is the highest (accounting for 60%), and elementary school teachers who are said to be only competent when married have also had problems because of the resolution made at the Imperial Capital Education Conference in June last year to "grant pregnant female teachers a year of leave." It can be said that the current trend of all working women is like this. In addition to female teachers and female workers, women serving in postal affairs also have regulations for ten weeks of rest before and after childbirth, with 60% of their salary paid, but in general, it has not been implemented. According to newspaper reports, Bank A has a regulation for three weeks of rest during childbirth, but it has not been implemented. The only thing that has been implemented is the practice of being dismissed upon marriage. Even if we take those regulations for three weeks of rest during childbirth, what standards are used to stipulate them? There is really nothing else to say besides using the phrase "better than nothing."</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the development of women on the professional front has not brought them any happiness. The old illusions have been shattered, but their future is hiding countless reefs.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Russian Working Women Under the Microscope (Part 1) <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Zhiyun</p>
<p>"Everyone must work; everyone has a job." This is almost a universal belief in Russia today. Not only the men of the country are like this, but also the women of the country. The completion of the First Five-Year Plan was 42% the responsibility of women. From this, you can see the efforts of Russian women in their work. Indeed, in Russia, almost every woman from the age of sixteen to fifty is a working woman. So in reality, there is no need to add the word "professional" to Russian women.</p>
<p>Russian women have already penetrated into all professional circles. There are traces of women in every profession. These women are the same as men in everything except for their physiological differences. Moreover, there are now some women who have cut their hair short, removed their high heels, and changed into men's clothes, hats, shoes, and socks, completely becoming men. In Moscow, the capital of Russia, an estimated 17% to 20% of women have been altered, and women engaged in heavy industry have the highest heat for alteration, accounting for 40% to 45% of the altered women.</p>
<p>During the First Five-Year Plan, nearly 30% or more of the women in Moscow worked in heavy industry factories. Because the compensation for working in heavy industry factories was more generous than in other professions. However, at that time, the Russian government's management of consumption control was very strict, so although these women received better rewards, their lives were still very difficult. Therefore, at that time, some women, after working six or seven hours a day, asked to continue working for three or four more hours in order to earn a better living wage.</p>

<h3 id="e222">A Record of an Interview with Ms. Zhang Xiangwen <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiping</p>
<p>Women's professions in China have always been considered very immature. It is already not easy for a woman to succeed in society and gain an economically independent position. If she goes a step further, starts a certain business, and seeks to benefit the public, then she can naturally be considered an outstanding woman. With this thought in mind, I thought of Ms. Zhang Xiangwen. She is a female obstetrician. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, she founded the Renhe Hospital and Obstetrics School on Avenue Joffre. In the eleventh year, she went to the United States to study at the New York Medical Research Institute, and then went to Europe to study various medical careers. With deeper knowledge, she returned to China and developed her ambitions. For the past 20 years, the "Renhe" she has painstakingly managed has been regarded as a complete obstetric hospital at sea. Her spirit and perseverance are admirable. All those who serve in it are women, and most of them are single women. It is no exaggeration to say that "Renhe" is one of the birthplaces of women's professions at sea. This time I had a ten-hour conversation with Ms. Zhang. To sum up, there are the following five points:</p>
<p>"Mrs. Sanger, the leader of the world's birth control movement, has already come to China. People in our country have different views on her. As a famous obstetrician and gynecologist, I wonder what your impressions are of her? I think Mrs. Sanger has attracted people's attention, so I first raised the issue of birth control."</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang answered me without hesitation, as if she had long held her own opinion on this. She said: "Mrs. Sanger's birth control movement is nothing more than arousing people's awareness of the suffering of multiple births and the knowledge of birth control. As for the effect, it may not be significant. Because it is extremely difficult for couples who can reproduce to control themselves or have children on a regular basis. It is by no means something that can be achieved through verbal or written propaganda. Mrs. Sanger has been advocating birth control for many years, but she does not necessarily have effective birth control methods. The medicines and equipment mentioned in ordinary books are not necessarily reliable. Unless women receive practical guidance from doctors, it can be effective."</p>
<p>"I often advise women who have had many children and are too weak to have children to practice birth control, but only 30 to 40 percent of those who can obey the doctor's guidance. It can be seen that birth control methods are not easy to popularize. Couples with nervous diseases, heart disease, lung disease, venereal diseases, etc. are of course not allowed to have children. I advocate that women who have had too many children or are physically weak should practice birth control regardless of whether they are rich or poor. Some people say that the poor should practice birth control, while the rich can have more children. In fact, the children of wealthy families often only know how to spend money and do not engage in proper business, but become social parasites; while the children of poor families are often hardworking and self-motivated, and strive to engage in careers that are beneficial to society and the country. Just look at the history of successful people at home and abroad, ancient and modern, who were born in poverty; but most of the people who do evil are descendants of the declining rich and powerful, so the intellectual class can study eugenics, and birth control is not limited to the rich and poor. I think women can practice birth control after having a maximum of four children. As for women who do not have children, they can only use their energy to serve society. Furthermore, young men and women must not study birth control, otherwise they will inevitably increase invisible dangers. For women who have many children after marriage, there are only two ways to practice birth control: to be pure-hearted and have few desires and to listen to the guidance of doctors." "I heard that Dr. Zhang has always been enthusiastic about social undertakings. May I ask which one you are most interested in in the past?"</p>
<p>"I am very ashamed! I have achieved nothing in the past 20 years, and I have wasted my time. Among the work I have done in the past, I am most interested in Renhe Hospital and the midwifery school. In addition, I have provided financial assistance to those who are suffering and ambitious to pursue advanced studies, subsidized poor students, provided free treatment to poor pregnant women and poor patients, and cultivated talents to serve society. I am satisfied with those who have achieved results. At that time, when I encountered women with serious illnesses and difficult labor, and their lives were in great danger, I was most happy when I treated them and avoided danger. Generally speaking, in the world, everything is most satisfying when extremely difficult difficulties are overcome and success is achieved."</p>
<p>"Dr. Zhang, can you recall the process of founding Renhe Hospital and the midwifery school and how you dealt with the difficulties?"</p>
<p>"I founded Renhe Hospital and the School of Obstetrics and Gynecology in the sixth year of the Republic of China. At that time, there was no school of obstetrics and gynecology in Shanghai, and people did not pay attention to new methods of delivery. Most of the students who enrolled were graduates of middle schools or normal schools, and their level was higher than now. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, I bought land to build a house, which is now the address of the hospital on Molier Road. "Renhe" is exactly 20 years old this year. More than 200 midwives have graduated, and they are distributed in various provinces and can serve enthusiastically. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, in order to allow students to practice, I added the Shangxian Hall Women and Children's Hospital and added a nursing school. Speaking of the word difficulty, that is what obstetricians often encounter. For the sake of patients and pregnant women, I often feel restless day and night, and I forget to eat and sleep; I can only sacrifice my own spirit to deal with all the difficulties; fortunately, I am not burdened by family, otherwise I would not be able to bear the busy work."</p>
<p>"What are Dr. Zhang's views on women's professions? And which one is the most suitable?"</p>
<p>"Women's management of household affairs is a basic job. If they can serve society in addition to managing household affairs, then they can be considered outstanding talents. I think women who have economic power often demand specialized academic knowledge: secondly, in addition to ordinary knowledge, they should all learn nursing skills. The old concept of our people often despises nursing, while in European, American and Japanese countries, nurses are very common. Even princesses learn nursing. Because as a nurse, she can serve the family, pay attention to hygiene, or take care of her husband and children, and she will not fail to be a good wife and mother; she can also serve the country, and the front and rear are very important during the war."</p>
<p>"Dr. Zhang is single. May I ask what your views are on the advantages and disadvantages of being single?" I felt a bit awkward before asking the question, but driven by curiosity, I finally raised this overlooked topic.</p>
<p>"I don't advocate women being single, but women who are determined to be single must first have an unbreakable belief, that is, to vow to sacrifice everything of their own and the happiness of their family, and devote themselves to society, only to fulfill their obligations to the public; otherwise, being single will lose its true meaning. In my early years, for the sake of the future of the hospital and the school, I decided to be single, so that my whole body and mind would not be burdened by the family; now, my humble ambition can be considered a small achievement, and I am satisfied. However, I do not hope that others will be single, after all, it also has a great impact on the future of the nation." She said these words with a very serious attitude.</p>

<h3 id="e224">A Page on Women's Professions in Harbin <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ga</p>
<p>Now, among the four northeastern provinces, Harbin is the most popular for women's professions. At first, all professions were controlled by men. Since the September 18th Incident, women have slowly found a way out, which is also the beginning of the promotion of women's professions. At that time, various institutions also began to employ female staff. Speaking of women's professions in Harbin, it is really pitiful. Just as a glimmer of dawn appeared in the eyes of the people of Harbin, it disappeared into darkness in the blink of an eye. The kind of women's profession that is污as a "vase" cannot only give women some luck, but instead causes women a lot of pain!</p>
<p>Various institutions completely value appearance over talent when choosing female staff. When applying for a job, they look at the women's heads, bodies, and feet again and again, and then decide whether to stay or leave. If the woman who goes to apply does not have a pretty face, it is difficult to be hired. If hired, they are only given the job of typing, and no other work is given. According to them, "women only have the ability to type." Sometimes, female staff have no work to do, and they have to sit in the office, being browsed and joked. In the beginning, most of these female staff were next to senior staff, and later they became popular in every office, so the incidents of female staff being joked increased even more.</p>
<p>The bosses of the stores have also become smart because of the incident. They know that without female shop assistants to attract customers, the business will not develop, so in order to maintain the economic downturn, they also hire female shop assistants. However, the main condition for the boss to hire female shop assistants is a beautiful face and a slender body. They use the beauty of women to make advertisements and attract customers to come and buy. In less than half a month, the business suddenly developed a lot. At the same time, restaurants also hire female waiters, and opium dens also hire female receptionists. This kind of women's profession seems to be living a hellish life. How can it be said that it is a profession? It is completely a disguised form of selling laughter, exchanging one's flesh and soul for some salary.</p>
<p>Recently, a new type of women's profession has emerged, that is, after the Harbin passenger buses were taken over by the municipal government, the municipal authorities specially recruited a group of female ticket sellers in order to promote women's professions. The requirements were to be young, preferably between the ages of 15 and 25, and to have a senior elementary school education or above. Most of the women who applied were high school graduates. On the first day of the female ticket sellers' work, a group of men scrambled to watch the female ticket sellers. Some even came to ride the bus for a while just to see the female ticket sellers, so the income of the bus that day became an astonishing number. Would anyone be willing to believe that Harbin, known as the "Oriental Little Paris," actually has such a unique phenomenon?</p>

<p>— Xin</p>
<p>One afternoon, when we opened the back door and thought of strolling on the road, two girls suddenly came. They did not wear any makeup on their faces. Both of them were wearing black cheongsams, and their leather shoes were flat-heeled. Each of them was carrying a small 12-inch leather suitcase.</p>
<p>"Grandma! Do you want to buy some Fragrant Soap?" One of the two saw my wife and came to solicit business; at the same time, she opened her small leather suitcase, which was full of colorful soaps.</p>
<p>"This kind of soap is of very good quality and the price is very cheap. It only sells for eight cents a piece. It is for advertising in our company. You can't buy it anywhere else!" The other continued to babble a lot of words.</p>
<p>Ah! Only then did I realize that they were female salespersons; at the same time, I opened the conversation box and talked with them for a while, and then I understood that the life of female salespersons also has its own pain that others do not know.</p>
<p>Because of the economic downturn in the city, all industries are becoming more and more desolate and declining day by day. Merchants who want to survive this extraordinary period must of course start with sales. Soap is a cosmetic for women. Recruiting a group of girls who have no bread to eat to sell it is really the most appropriate thing to do. The merchants' intentions are not bitter, but the economic downturn is still an economic downturn. If there are no customers for sales, their bread problem still has no solution.</p>
<p>They were originally two of the unemployed. They had only been recruited by a certain company to be female salespersons for two weeks. There was no salary. They would get a rebate of 20 cents for selling one dollar of soap. If there was business, it would not be difficult to earn one or two dollars a month, but in these two weeks, they were running around all day long. As a result, they only sold less than five dollars worth of soap, and the so-called rebate was less than one dollar. Can less than one dollar solve the bread problem for fourteen days?</p>
<p>My wife finally took out 20 cents and 14 copper coins to buy three bars of soap. When they walked out of the alley, I felt that the lives of these two female salespersons were very pitiful!</p>

During the quitting period, he was mentally depressed, seminal emission occurred frequently, and stomach pain occurred in bursts. Just as he was about to smoke again, fortunately his colleague Mr. Tang Xuehua directed him to seek treatment at my place. I prescribed the following prescription for him.</p>

<p>(1) Safe Smoking Cessation for Women's Diseases</p>
<p>Patient Mrs. Shi Dexin. (Complaint) - Menstrual pain. Leukorrhea. (Medical History) - Mrs. Shi was born weak and was prone to melancholy and illness. She lost her conditioning, which led to more losses. Before she got married, she often felt tired because she helped her mother with work. She suffered from uterine cold and menstrual pain. She also became addicted to smoking with her mother. She had repeatedly tried to quit but failed. After marriage, she suffered from leukorrhea. She secretly hid it. The relationship between husband and wife gradually faded. It was not until last autumn that her mother's smoking addiction and stomach problems were safely treated by me with "Female Reproductive Hormone" and "Stomach Pain Ling." She also came to me to quit. (Treatment) - I observed that Mrs. Shi suffered from severe uterine inflammation. I immediately instructed her to purchase "Female Reproductive Hormone" from the medicine department of Yong'an Company to warm the uterus, regulate menstruation, eliminate inflammation, and relieve pain, and gave her "Leukorrhea Ling" to let her use it externally at home. Because "Female Reproductive Hormone" can also replenish vitality and eliminate toxins and addiction, she recovered her health and beauty in about a month. The affection between husband and wife was better than that of newlyweds.</p>

It was not until last autumn that he came to my clinic for diagnosis. (Treatment) - In addition to performing the latest scientific surgical electrical therapy, I also treated the source of Mr. Cheng's disease in the reproductive glands. Only "Reproductive Hormone" could achieve the effect of symptomatic treatment.

<p>Separate Cures for Waist Pain, Bone Pain, and Stomach Pain</p>
<p>Patient: Hong Wenhua. Age 42. Local resident. Businessman. (Chief complaint) – Sore back and waist. Sore bones and joints. Intermittent stomach pain. (Medical history) – Mr. Hong's symptoms have been long-standing, all caused by a lack of attention to health maintenance. Improper treatment has led to him being trapped in the torment of illness. Over many years, he has progressed from numbness in his hands and feet to hemiplegia, from lumbar and back pain to premature aging, and from frequent stomach pain to loss of appetite and a weak stomach. It wasn't until last autumn that, upon recommendation from his colleague Mr. Li, he came to me for treatment. (Present symptoms) – Premature aging. Hemiplegia. Loss of appetite and weak stomach. (Treatment) – I prescribed Stomach Pain Remedy to treat his stomach pain. "Jianwei Su" to strengthen his stomach. "Strong's Bone Pain Tablets" to treat his rheumatism and bone pain. "Shengzhi Su" to treat his sore back and waist and premature aging, etc. Mr. Hong was instructed to purchase and take these medicines according to the instructions at the Huamei Pharmacy for a period of one month. All three ailments have been reported to have been cured.</p>
<p>Salvation for Patients Suffering from Insomnia and Nocturnal Emission</p>
<p>Patient: Leng Yuanrong. Age 20. Not specified. (Chief complaint) – Nocturnal emission. Wet dreams. Insomnia. Forgetfulness. (Medical history) – Mr. Leng, at a young age, was poisoned by indecent books and mistakenly indulged in the bad habit of self-pollution, secretly harming himself. This severely depleted his essence and weakened his brain, leading to the symptoms he described. Neglecting treatment, the frequency of his nocturnal emissions has increased. Over time, even without dreams, he unconsciously experiences involuntary emission. He suffers from dizziness, lower back pain, and unbearable weakness. Last autumn, he sought treatment from me. (Present symptoms) – Weakened sexual function. Weak brain and depleted essence. Neurasthenia. (Treatment) – I determined that Mr. Leng's condition could not be radically cured with ordinary preparations. I immediately instructed him to purchase "Shengzhi Su" and "Ximitu's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" from the Xin Xin Company's pharmaceutical department and take them. Once his sexual function was strengthened, his nocturnal emissions ceased. His mind became clear and healthy, and all symptoms disappeared. Taking half a dozen courses of the medication achieved the most satisfactory results, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e238">More Than Three Hundred Ferrymen Cause Disturbance <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Da Mu</p>
<p>I once saw a foreign film featuring a mechanically constructed human body that could perform all human tasks, efficiently and quickly, without fatigue, hunger, clothing, or illness, producing more and consuming less. At the time, I was delighted at the prospect of such robots working in the world and even hoped they could come to China.</p>
<p>Material scientific civilization in the 20th century has already reached a critical point, and it is not difficult to imagine a situation where all human affairs are mechanized. However, once that situation is realized, the question of whether people left idle can eat or obtain a livelihood becomes a major problem. This is evident even in the current social situation. This "evident" aspect is particularly pronounced in China.</p>
<p>According to reports: "At Dongjiadu in the Southern District... on the first day of operating the ferry... more than three hundred former ferrymen gathered at the docks on both the east and west banks... Their momentum was fierce. The dock manager, seeing the situation, feared that an incident would occur and immediately opened the iron gate... The Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched an additional... seventy police officers to persuade the ferrymen to disperse..." and so on.</p>
<p>To the average person, this may seem like an insignificant disturbance. In reality, ferries are faster and safer than small boats, which is "convenient for travelers." This convenience, of course, relies on machinery. However, let us think about those "more than three hundred former ferrymen." The work they depended on for a living has been completely taken away by one or two machines. How will they support their families in the future? They have no place left to sell their strength and sweat, and they are forced to watch the omnipotent machines flaunt their power before them. Their disturbance is nothing less than a plea to society: to demand the restoration of their lost jobs, to demand the continuation of their lives.</p>
<p>As people living in this century, we do not oppose science, material progress, and the improvement and needs of machinery. However, distorted development is probably not beneficial for society. Capitalists originally wanted to use machinery to increase productivity and seize vast wealth; but on the other hand, they also have to find a way out for the millions of unemployed people squeezed out of the circle of life. "More than three hundred ferrymen causing disturbance" is just the beginning. "Persuading them to disperse" is, after all, only a temporary measure, isn't it?</p>
<p>The mechanical human body in the movie makes me shiver a bit.</p>

<p>"Don't even mention it! Ever since—" He glanced at that Greater Empire citizen, "ever since... the occupation of Guandong, there hasn't been a single day of peace. It's as if everything belongs to them. Aren't they holding the knife handle in their hands? What's there to say? What's there to say..."</p>
<p>"Perfectly good people are being arrested for no reason and might be shot at any moment. They call them 'bandits' or 'outlaws.' Where is justice? Really," (he lowered his voice) "it's the righteous army fighting them to the death that they can't handle..."</p>
<p>"Why did you come south?"</p>
<p>"I couldn't stay there any longer. I really couldn't stand it. We just can't bear the injustice! There's simply no justice... alas..." He couldn't go on!</p>
<p>"Is escaping the solution?" I asked him again.</p>
<p>"Well, it's still better than being a subjugated slave, isn't it?" he continued, his tone now resolute and forceful! "This, as long as we have breath, we'll settle the score later..."</p>
<p>He said hatefully, as if forgetting himself and everyone else. He recalled his experiences and poured them out endlessly. Undoubtedly, an indelible record had already formed in his mind. Let his record deepen! Deepen! When it can't deepen any further, let it erupt! Truly... let it erupt uncontrollably... let it be replaced by a bloody, glorious, and clear record!</p>
<p>After that, he fell silent! His face was expressionless, and he sank into thought!</p>
<p>The train stopped at Hangzhou Station. The incomprehensible hawking voices from outside the station still filled my ears! At that time, that citizen from the friendly nation had already left the station, still wearing that stiff-faced, self-important, and arrogant expression! His face was still raised, desperately raised—raised to the sky, until he disappeared into the crowd. (The End)</p>

<p>There are many rats in my house. It's alright during the day, but at night it's practically a rat world. They even fight on top of the mosquito net.</p>
<p>I wake up in the middle of the night to the sound of rats gnawing at the broken box under the bed. I worry about that box of old books. The next morning, I open it up and, as expected, a box of old books has turned into half a box. The ones that haven't been shredded are riddled with holes and covered in urine and feces. The rats have impolitely taken up residence as their mansion.</p>
<p>I have a habit when organizing books! I read them as I organize them, which means it always takes me half a day. This time is no exception.</p>
<p>As I flipped through them, I came across a tattered copy of "Sanxian Ji". Because the top few pages had been soiled with urine, I tore them off and threw them away, so what was left started from page fifty-one. On page fifty-one was an article called "Describing Hong Kong's Congratulations on Christmas". At first, I thought it was about the so-called "foreign winter solstice" "Christmas" because the words "Christmas" were followed by "Hong Kong". But then I saw that it was actually about "The Birthday of the Great Accomplished Sage and Teacher Confucius". So I patted my slightly smelly hands and continued reading—</p>
<p>The article "described" "literary figures and scholars improvising with their brushes", "described" various schools "performing new plays or showing movies at night" after the Christmas ceremony. It also "described" the "new-style couplets" at the school gates and the "speeches expressing congratulations on Confucius' birthday" in the newspapers. It also "described" the "Licentious Empress" produced by the "Confucius Sacred Society," as well as "Ji Gong's Biography", "Havoc in Heaven", and "Wu Song Kills His Sister-in-Law" being performed in other theaters.</p>
<p>After reading it, I smiled slightly and set it aside. When I had finished sorting and was about to wrap the books in newspapers and tie them up with string, I suddenly froze. It turned out that the</p>

<p>According to reports, elementary school textbooks in North China must be rewritten or replaced with existing textbooks from outside the Pass (Northeast China). Tan Lao San said that the textbooks of the puppet state are no different from Japanese textbooks. Since September 18th, the number of Chinese youths studying in Japan has surged. Now that North China is using Japanese textbooks, wouldn't that save Chinese youths who aspire to study in Japan a lot of tuition fees? One cannot deny that this shows their consideration.</p>
<p>Five organizations, including the American Anti-Occupation Association and the Pacifist Association, held a demonstration on the 29th to protest Japan's national policy and demonstrated at the Japanese consulate. Tan Lao San said that such actions are somewhat comical. They are called demonstrations but are essentially requests. Japan, under its blatant policy of aggression, is not afraid of any demonstrations. If the Japanese hear about such actions, they will merely laugh and say, "Understood, noted," and that's it. There will be no other response.</p>

<p>newspaper actually had a "Beijing dispatch" about "Christmas".</p>
<p>That dispatch said: "This year, Beijing is advocating a particularly grand celebration for the worship of Confucius, restoring all ancient rituals. Preparations have been actively underway since before. In recent years, new-style rituals have often been used for the worship of Confucius, such as reading wills, singing party songs, and bowing. The ceremonies are simple. As a result, the old sacrificial vessels and musical instruments have been stored for many years, covered in inches of dust, and all need to be cleaned. Furthermore, many of the current officials are newly appointed and unfamiliar with ancient rituals, so they also need to rehearse... The Municipal Government, to show its respect and caution, has specially formed a ceremonial preparation office and stipulated that the grand ceremony will be held at dawn on the 25th. At 2 PM on the 24th, they will first rehearse the ceremony at the Imperial College. The first offering will be accompanied by the Song of Confucius, the second offering will be accompanied by the Music of Welcoming, and the final offering will be accompanied by the Melody of Mian Ting (all ancient music). The offerings will consist of a full sacrifice (two whole cows, sixteen whole pigs and sixteen whole sheep), bian dou (chestnuts, peanuts, etc., five kinds in total), and silk and jue cups, etc. Mr. Song will personally lead the heads of various agencies in offering sacrifices, and everything will be carried out with the utmost respect." (February 28th, Current Affairs News)</p>
<p>I don't know what plays are being performed in Beijing theaters lately. As for Shanghai, Mr. Xiang Peiliang's "Chocolate Girl" has just finished its run, and the "patriotic" "national essence" of "Ji Gong's Biography", "Pan Jinlian", "Burning the Red Lotus Temple", and "Tang Monk's Journey to the West" are being performed with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The "Describing Hong Kong's Congratulations on Christmas" article included two "new-style couplets" for male and female schools. I will now respectfully copy them down. Although there is a ten-year difference in time, the broken book has the year 1928 on page sixty-one, so I assume the article was written in at least 1927.) But they are still applicable today.

<p>Based on the history of Lu, writing the Spring and Autumn Annals, condemning Tian Heng of Qi, the principle is righteous and the way of heaven is right, overthrowing treacherous sons and rebellious ministers, avoiding red propaganda, demanding revenge for the father's hatred, communism and public wives, destroying moral principles and ethics.</p>
<p>Slaying the Three Du, emerging from Cangjia, executing Shaozheng Mao, the wind acts swiftly and the thunder is fierce, eradicating corrupt officials and tyrannical clerks, training youth in moral education, cultivating oneself and managing the family, loving parents and respecting elders, saving the world and the hearts of the people.</p>
<p>Kun (Female) School Gate Couplet</p>
<p>The mother relies on the son's nobility, the wife relies on the husband's honor, now is the time to sincerely celebrate the sacred, it is appropriate to revere the three obediences, how can you speak of freedom, shut your mouths and submit, blindly misunderstanding freedom, following the trend and becoming fickle.</p>
<p>Men receive Qian's strength, women occupy Kun's compliance, at this moment we respect the principles of Confucius, do not violate the four virtues, don't say what is what, what is what, until you don't know what is what, following society and showing off.</p>
<p>The original book has an explanation for the latter couplet: "Mai" means to close, "you" means what, "you" means none. It is because women and petty people do not know elegant teachings, so vulgar words are used.</p>

<p>— Liang Qijun</p>
<p>I love lamps.</p>
<p>At night, hiding in my small room, quietly, I put away the books I'm tired of reading. I only feel that there is nothing else as lovely as this pale blue light.</p>
<p>In the notes or novels of my predecessors, I often read about young widows and nuns who are devoted to asceticism, accompanied by green lamps, spending their lives lonely and desolate. If, on a quiet autumn night, you hear the paulownia trees outside telling their sorrows in the night wind, and you happen to read these stories, you might shed tears of sympathy. However, I don't love lamps for this reason.</p>
<p>Because—</p>
<p>Under its gentle comfort, everyone feels that light is great and eternal. – We should thank the lamp, the only "messenger of light" in the dark night.</p>
<p>(Have you ever seen the small grass growing in a dark place? How pitiful it is! Weak, pale.</p>
<p>(...Without light, it's like having no life.)</p>
<p>Because of the lamp, I think of the moth. I watch the little thing constantly circling the lamp, flying and dancing with all its might. Clever people will reveal contemptuous sneers and say,</p>
<p>— A foolish thing.</p>
<p>However, who is foolish and who is clever?</p>
<p>The most clever are often the most foolish.</p>

<p>— Qiu Yuan</p>
<p>It was already past mid-morning, and the sun was shining. Qiuhua was tidying her disheveled hair.</p>
<p>— We still have to go to one place, to Jiading, to Suzhou, to Kunshan?</p>
<p>— No, let's go to Qingyang Port. We've never been there before. Have you been there before?</p>
<p>— No, good, let's go together.</p>
<p>— I'm afraid it's too late now, we won't make the train.</p>
<p>— Well, let's see.</p>
<p>She hurriedly tidied her clothes, stepped onto a rickshaw, and arrived at the train station at five minutes before nine. She bought a ticket and ran onto the platform. The stationmaster had already prepared the red and green flags. The carriages were crowded with people. They walked and walked until they reached the foremost third-class carriage, where they found two empty seats. It seemed as if it was a match made in heaven for Zhuo Min and Qiuhua. The train left Zhenru. The scenery of the Jiangnan region in early winter showed no signs of withering. The leaves were always so green, and the fields stretched endlessly, which, although monotonous, also broadened one's horizons; the red maple leaves dotted the plains, making one feel the natural charm of the countryside even more. The sun gently shone in through the train window. People's complexions were so pleasant, and on the soft faces that didn't use any modern cosmetics, there floated a natural, harmonious color reflected from the heart.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Lin Daiyu"</p>
<p>The beauty of Xiaoxiang Fairy is unmatched. Listening to the parrot reciting poetry, her heart is about to break. The golden wind blows down the autumn paulownia leaves. Her slender and delicate body feels the evening coolness. She stops embroidering. She closes the gauze window. In her boudoir, after bathing, she arranges her remaining makeup. She lightly applies spiral ink to her green spring mountains. She thinly paints rouge with orchid musk fragrance. She loosely combs her cloud-like temples. Her faded red shirt reveals her fair skin. Standing silently on the jade steps. She lightly holds a round fan facing the sunset. The golden crow gradually sinks into the western mountains. The moon shines on the flower tips, reflecting a silver wall. She turns and pities her beautiful shadow. She whispers to the snow goose to light the silver lamp. Ziyuan, the maid, asks, "My lady, why do you always sigh with tears in your eyes? Your heart is full of things that people don't understand. For whom are you losing weight and beauty?" Helplessly, the night is long. She loosens her silk clothes and gets on the ivory bed. She hears the rain beating on the banana leaves and wetting the crabapple flowers.</p>

<p>He was a poor, skinny child prodigy. He constantly worked hard by reflecting snow and using fireflies. His brothers died early, and his parents passed away. He had no place to live but a broken kiln. He didn't complain about not having enough to eat or wear. Suddenly, he heard a commotion outside the wall. He was sent a city-toppling beauty. The family servants left in a hurry. The scholar was so frightened that he was witless. Chang'e should be in the Guanghan Palace. He bowed deeply and asked carefully. The thin-fated girl's name was Yao Cao, the daughter of Ma Rong. She diligently worked at needlework every year. She was going to offer her talents to the Liang Prime Minister's mansion. She vowed not to follow the path of literature. How could she be like those unfilial people? She wanted to marry a poor scholar. This involved the meddlesome Prime Minister Jian. If you don't mind my ugly appearance, I'm willing to be a humble servant. Where can I accompany you to study until the fifth watch? Otherwise, I will be buried in a ditch. I fear falling into the eighteenth level of hell. I will never fail you in this life.</p>

<p>Warner Brothers' latest aviation passion blockbuster, "Ceiling Zero," starring the "daredevil" superstar James Cagney and Pat O'Brien (who will collaborate again in "China Clipper"), is scheduled to premiere today at the Grand Theater. The film is adapted from the Broadway stage hit that ran for six months. It tells the story of a brave and promising young man who sacrifices his life for science. The director is Howard Hawks, renowned in Hollywood for his aviation films. "Hell's Angels" was one of his directorial works. At a time when slogans of national salvation through aviation are shouted everywhere, this film serves as an excellent stimulant. As for James Cagney's acting, he remains true to his past style, portraying a courageous and lively young man.</p>
<h3 id="e252">"Bridal Chamber Night" Premieres in Paris <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>"Bridal Chamber Night" is the film that made Gary Cooper, the lead of "A Farewell to Arms," famous, and is also the first collaboration between him and Anna Sten, the star of "Nana" and "Resurrection." The story revolves around the lack of freedom in women's marriages, a delicate flower ravaged by storms. Beauty has always had a tragic fate. The bridal chamber is like a execution ground, filled with sorrow and lingering emotions. Even a heart of stone would shed tears upon seeing it, and even plants would be moved. May all the sentimental movie fans in the world have the fortune to see it.</p>

<p>"Fa Yang" Bai Nan said: "Film criticism is now in complete decline." (Confucius said: Probably because "Daily Film" has ceased publication.) I wonder if the articles written by Bai Nan in Silhouettes count as "film criticism"?</p>
<p>Tell Mr. "Philosopher" that Wu Han's "service attitude" is "very responsible," arriving early and leaving late. After the six o'clock working hours, he still goes to the director's department to discuss for an hour, very "actively working."</p>
<p>Wu Han's first achievement in Mingxing: From now on, all drafts written by the publicity department will be reviewed by the director's department before publication. (It is said that the position is presided over by the superficial Wang Gong, congratulations!)</p>
<p>"Philosopher" Xu Suling (current "Prime Minister" of Yi Hua) said: "Those who truly bury themselves in hard work will always get what they deserve. Yi Hua Company was ruined in the hands of a large number of amateurs, and the corrupt group also left Yi Hua. Everyone thought Yi Hua was hopeless, with no money, no actors, no future, nothing. But recently, Yi Hua Company has shown signs of revival. Who says there is no hope for Chinese films?" (Confucius said: "To represent one's own words as public opinion - I really don't understand how humans can be so despicable.")</p>
<p>Has Yi Hua been revived? I think it's a little too early to say. But our obligatory advertisement must be made: To the "helpless" film company bosses: Currently, there is "someone who can produce some results and is definitely not an amateur," a "contributor to the revival of Yi Hua," those who want to "revive," why not come! Addendum: The so-called "revival" probably means being able to run to Nanjing.</p>
<p>(Confucius said: What is Xu Suling's "a bit of achievement"? It's "Bridal Chamber Night." To avoid saying "representing one's own words as public opinion," right and wrong should be left to public opinion.)</p>
