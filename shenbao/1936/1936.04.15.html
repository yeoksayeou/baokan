<p>— 柳</p>
<p>自法幣推行未及半載成效卓著惟使用銀幣之續展期限轉瞬屆滿此後銀貸失其交換之價值成爲死幣自無待言所可慮者人民有重視硬幣之心習從地域交通信用智識各方面一爲觀察欲於短時期內盡行改革就緒自非易易如處理稍或失當徒增人民之疑慮勢必出於隱藏之一途若嚴隱藏之禁宏告發之獎誠恐奸胥乘機閭閻騷擾明季開掘銀鑛之弊可爲殷鑑故立法院審議妨碍國幣懲治條例於隱藏現銀獨不列入立委馬寅初氏之言曰「民間偶藏少數現銀如規定應受懲治不啻爲警察開方便之門徒擾人民此其一用政治力量强迫人民交出現銀反足以使人民隱藏現銀祇須穩定法幣信用人民自當樂於以存銀兌換法幣此其二」此不失爲扼要之論深得爲治之本蓋政府但使人民自知隱藏現銀爲錯誤不智之行爲不待刑勸誅求而現銀自交出矣</p>
<p>現在集中之現銀雖尚未盡人民之所有然都市人民對於貨幣之信用觀念已不如以前之偏執當無死藏硬貨之心理卽偶有所存數絕微細猶是「積穀防飢」之用意耳至於內地以年來現銀不絕外流之結果民間幾全行用紙幣且自災患頻仍農村破產資金向都市移動集中於銀行者居多卽有狃於積習以及歷來所窖藏數必不鉅故寬假時日使現銀集中誠非難事若使用之禁决難再寬則掉換之期不宜限制蓋人民至迫於使用之際亦必戚覺死藏之無謂而思出於掉換如不予掉換在人民固屬損失於國家亦豈有利故能使銀幣掉換法幣之門長啟不閉民間現銀自必不絕而來也</p>
<p>至將來掉換手續亦堪研究吾則易被誤認爲「意圖供行使之用而收集或意圖營利而運輸刑章所在隱藏之幣又將趙趄不前故必保障其安全凡向就地兌換法幣機關兌換者不禁就地無可掉換得申請本地公共機關出給證明書或護照之類持赴最近兌換法幣之塲所兌換之或用以繳納公家捐稅及保證金如此則銀貨無逃亡之虞民之藏有現銀者有陸續兌換之便上下相維民不擾而事自集矣</p>

<h3>本星期中國際會議　歐局和戰所擊　對意問題英法意見參商　一注目萊茵一關心尼羅　集體安全勢將空成夢想</h3>
<p>日內瓦　本星期有關歐局和戰之議事程序、有下列數種、　星期二日十三國委員會主席西班牙代表瑪達里伽、將代表該委員會與意阿兩國代表交換關於東菲事件和議之條件、　星期三英法比三國之參謀本部將集議於倫敦、討論一旦德國攻擊三國時、陸空海三方共同防禦之方法、　星期四十三國委員會將聽取瑪達里伽之報告、於此除非意國能排受一種公允之和平方穿外、國必要求對意重施新制裁、此　步驟、必將引起兩種極自然之結果、　卽英法意見參商而成正面衝突、　卽意國必因是而重復仇英、加深地中海之戰機、但英國對此二結果、皆將唯力是視以為應付、一則因英國公衆對於意大利慘無人道之空軍轟炸與毒氣彈之施放、大爲震怒、政府不能不有所顧忌也、二則墨索里尼在東菲與地巾海之野心、英政府亦不能再行漠視、</p>

<h3>親英抑親意　法國徘徊歧途</h3>
<p>薩勞總理將發演說　說明對意阿案立塲</p>
<p>（巴黎）星期四十三國委員會開會時、法國究將採取親意政策、抑將採取親英政策、頗使法國政治家絞盡腦汁、總理薩勞今日特與意國駐法大使賽路蒂會談、其後據官塲發言人聲稱、法國之態度、於星期二日英閣集議之前、不欲有所確定同時薩勞又將與彭古會商、巴黎午報對於目前之時局、有如下之評論、其言曰「今日英法意見之紛歧、不僅將破壞英法在歐洲之合作、同時更將使國聯爲之瓦解也、自辭職以來始終沈默之前總理賴伐爾、今日亦發言主張法國速與德國成立諒解、彼以爲一味拒絕談判、並無利益、同時賴氏又主張解除各國對意之制裁、裨其充分恢復參預歐事之地位、最後賴氏對於英國對德毁的之優容、允爲憤慨、（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）薩勞總理於午後六時半延見意國大使賽呂蒂、談至八時始畢、總理當卽往公府晋謁勒勃崙總統、報告談話情形、據聞賽呂蒂係向總理詢問法國政府對於意阿議和問題、採取何種態度云、外長佛蘭亭日前赴鄉間渡復活節假期、頃通知薩勞總理謂、當於星期三（卽十五日）返京、總理已定於是日發表重要政治演說、用無綫電廣播、屆時全國無綫電台對於他入所作政治演說、當一律停止播送、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德法不獲諒解　歐洲和平難期</h3>
<p>賴伐爾重申前政策　主復斯特萊薩陣綫</p>
<p>法國克萊芒斐朗城　前總理兼外長賴伐爾、頃向此間某報訪員發表談話云、「德法之間、苟不妥協、則歐洲和平、卽不克獲致」當余任總理兼外長時、會多方設法、俾使德法兩國互相接近、無如德國竟以廢止羅卡諾公的之舉、報答法國之妥協企圖、法國前曾要求德國、加入束歐公的、當時德國外長牛賴特、卽曾宣稱、縱使他國商定互助辦法、只須列入個別的文、則德國對於東歐公的、亦準備加入、孰知俄法兩國訂立互助公的之後、德國希特勒元首、卽以此爲口實而廢止羅卡諾公的乎、余對法國現政府之行動、不欲加以阻礙、「此際希特　業已提出具特建議、其細目余雖不欲加以考慮、但余相信、法國苟固執成見、拒絕談判、實屬錯誤、蓋時至今日、人心之不安、局勢之混亂、可謂瀰漫全歐、爲政者、自當以快刀斬亂麻之手段、迅速有所行動、舉凡德法兩國間懸案、均當迅速設法解决也、」賴伐爾嗣父追述渠在任時、對於意阿爭端所持之政策、謂英法兩國之間、苟能相互了解、卽可合作無間、溯當去年年杪、余與英國前外相霍爾爵士、在巴黎分袂之時、（卽擬定意阿兩國議和方案之後）余曾宣稱、吾人所行妥協政策、若果成功、則國際形勢、卽將豁然開朗、異日吾人可設法使德國厕身於集體安全組織之林矣云云、惜乎東菲之和平、旣未恢復、而歐洲之和平、亦尚有待於締造也、試問吾人現所爲者何事乎、吾人一面援引羅卡諾公的、而要求意大利通力合伴、另一方面、則履行國聯會盟的、而繼續對意實施制裁辦法、此種矛盾現象、詎可聽其持久、吾人對於斯　萊柴會義所造成之英法意三國陣綫、現當加以恢復、而將制裁辦法、予以撤消、俾意阿國和議、得以告成、夫然後可以較大之信用心注視歐洲之命運、而和平機構之組織、亦庶幾有豸矣」云云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英政府不欲　加緊對意制裁</h3>
<p>艾登定今日赴日內瓦　擬努力覓取解决方案</p>
<p>（倫敦）據此間人士所稱、英國政府對於意國、此際不擬加緊制裁手段、國聯大會十八國小組委員會、不久雖當召集、但其用意、非爲討論加緊制裁問題、而僅爲審食現行制裁辦法之實施情形、各該人士又謂、意阿和議談判、不日當在日內瓦開始舉行、英國政府極願其克底于成云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）謠傳英國因經濟制裁不足使意阿戰爭終止故有實施軍事制裁之意、國聯其他重要會員國亦準備贊助英國取此行動　衆聞此訊、大爲驚惶、惟據消息靈通方面聲稱、此項謠言絕無根據、英政府之政策、並未更變、巴黎各界亦不之信、據法外交部聲稱、現僅十八國委員會能决定國聯應對意實施軍事制裁、法國政界相信英外相艾登法外長佛蘭亭絕不致計議軍事行動、日內瓦未聞此種謠言、且不信重要國聯會員國保證贊助英國取軍事行動之說、日內瓦現覺任何更有效力之新制裁、必將引起非常重大之爭論、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）外相艾登頃於本日午間、自鄉間返抵京城、定於明日午後前往日內瓦、出席國聯會行政院十三國委員會、並將於今晚在沙遜爵士別墅脫蘭特公園與首相鮑爾溫討論一切、據負責人士宣稱、英國代表主要任務、乃對於意阿爭端、覓求解决方案、至若調解失敗、英國究當採取何項立塲、則不允有所表示、至對於德國則在本星期杪之前、不致進行接洽、駐德大使費潑斯爵士此際亦未接有何項訓令、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意派員赴日內瓦　會商媾和問題</h3>
<p>十三國委會開會展期</p>
<p>日內瓦　意國首相公署機要秘書阿洛锡、卽當與國聯會行政院十三國委員會主席瑪達里亞加會商意阿兩國議和問題、頃自羅馬來電稱、至早須俟星期三日午後始可到達日內瓦、消息靈通人士以爲、十三國委員會雖定於星期四日舉行會議、但爲瑪達里亞加與阿洛錫談話便利計、或當延至星期五日再行開會、瑪達里亞加、並當於事前與阿國代表卽該國駐法公使華特相會晤云、（十四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）政府頃已决定任命阿洛錫爲代表、俾與十三國委員會主席會商意阿和議談判問題、此間政界人士以爲此際爭執、不在意國與國聯會之間、而在英意兩國之間、蓋英國艾登外相近方就意軍作戰方式多方蒐羅材料藉以指控意國、而爲加緊制裁之口實、此在意國對於英國利益、雖當完全予以尊重、但本國所有利益則决當盡力保障、任何成脅、無不力予抵抗云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）政界人士頃官稱、意國對於阿比西尼亞國、係欲直接完全加以控制、英國與國聯會無論如何反抗、均不足以遏止法雪斯黨之動力、至英意兩國在軍事上相衝突一層、雖屬莫須有之事、但英國若以武力攻擊意國、則意國自能應付裕如云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>遵由外交途徑　英德賡續談判</h3>

<h3>英國將提建議　調和法德計劃</h3>
<p>中歐東歐和平亟須維持　國聯範圍內訂不侵犯約</p>
<p>（倫敦）據般人所知、英國政府對於東歐中歐兩處和平、亟欲加以維持、不日當向德國提出建議、藉以調和法德兩國之和平計劃、大抵英國主張、德國所提議之雙方互不侵犯公的常列入互助條欵、而簽訂此項公的之各國其所祖負之義務、當以國聯會盟的所規定者爲先、其他的束决之、庶幾可與盟約相適各、而與法國之建議亦可融洽、蘇聯外交委員李維諾夫前曾提出異議、謂依照德國所擬辦法、一旦德國侵略他國、則與德國訂立互不侵犯公的之各國卽無從履行國聯會盟的所載互助義務、今若以互助條欵列入互不侵犯公的之內、則蘇聯異議、自亦不能成立矣、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英法比參謀部　談話今日開始</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英法比三國參謀部依照羅卡諾協定草案所當進行之談話、定於明日（星期二）開始、意國政府尚未批准、此項協定、幷不派員參加、比國參謀部係以特丰敦中將。華特爾斯少校（駐英大使館陸軍參贊）充任代表、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（羅馬）意軍攻陷台西之說、未經官塲徵實、但據可靠方面消息、意軍現正努力進攻、期於四月二十一日羅馬誕生節日下之、意軍如佔據台西或哈拉爾、則南路陣錢意軍總司令格拉齊亞尼將軍卽將開始進攻阿京、東菲意軍總司令巴杜格略上將在耶穌復活節日與戰事訪員互相致賀時曾告諸訪員、彼等不久將有許多工作矣、同時阿王之下落、仍爲一疑團、有謂已割鬚遁走、以免爲部落之民識而攻擊者、有謂旦夕行將遜位者、有謂意國擬以哈拉爾公爵爲傀儡王者、但諸說無一能徵實（十四日路透電）</p>

<h3>偽官被捕事件　莫斯科報之倫評</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）消息報」論關東軍關於「發覺北興安省蒙人治理高級長官陰謀」報告訐此必將引起全世界之深刻注意、</p>
<p>世界各報必將詢問、日人設置之一省省長、負責保衛貧苦滿洲蒙民軍隊之參謀長（此等蒙民愛戴日人、反對蒙古人民共和國之侵害）最後竟連　察廳長自身、何能亦均領導驅逐日本解放者、及併入蒙古人民共和國之陰謀、</p>
<p>在此關東軍所處地位殊非易易、然而禍不單行、吾人不僅發見滿洲蒙人缺乏忠誠、且更發見關東軍總部缺乏機智及鎭靜、關束軍總部諸先生决將一切罪惡歸諸布爾色維克黨人、因而不加思索、决定指斥蘇聯爲忠實蒙民之誘惑者、</p>
<p>然而發生問題、卽關東軍總部如何選擇其最重要之邊省最高長官、當一軍隊準備作戰、而竟不知如何管理邊境、一旦發見省長自一九二九年來卽與蘇聯聯絡、竟在日本警察監視之下、與「敵」來往、供給後者軍事消息、此事實至嚴重、吾不知報告作者、將置關東軍總部於如何怪異地位也、</p>
<p>容余等爲關東軍總部辯護、卽關於被捕北興安省各領袖與蘇聯聯絡之種種傳說、乃爲舊傳說之又一返覆、視此關東軍總部之可笑報告、謂蘇聯代表參加北與安省高級長官活動、吾人敢謂此等長官、與滿洲其他各省長官相同、視日本爲侵害者、僅在威迫之下表示服從、</p>
<p>不僅關東軍總部、卽東京政府亦知滿洲長官及滿洲軍隊之效忠所費代價、及蒙古各王公擁護彼等所費代價、關東軍及日本帝國主義者咸知滿洲遍地鼎沸、「被解放」之滿蒙人民、正爲彼等貯藏各種駭怪事物、滿洲旣有如此困難聰明之帝國主義者必可得一結論勿再前進、然而關東軍見不及此、不僅準備作新冒險、且以神怪故事、致將　與日本和平共處之蘇聯關係日見緊張、日本帝國主義在滿洲有此不智長官、彼等必不能造成任何善果也、」（十四日塔斯電）</p>

<h3>論非常時期財政政策</h3>
<p>— 蕭淑宇</p>
<p>本　日，　寅初博士在南京中山學社講演非常時期的財政政策」，據他分析，我國歲入的主要部門為關鹽統二稅，待非常時期到臨，這一種稅都靠不住，第一因為海口遭受對鎖，對外貿易將致停頓，故　稅當然沒有，第二因為主要的鹽場，都在東南沿海，將必遭受佔令，鹽場旣失、自無鹽稅可收，第二統稅向恃上海天津和其他幾個大商埠，到那時這　地方都　遭　爛或佔領，所以統稅也　不住，以上　稅收旣然都沒希望，而同時公債因無抵押，也發不　，沒　子　有寶　通貨臌脹，然而鈔票發出太多，復原時善　維艱，最後他提出兩種辦法，作為對策，</p>
<p>實行徵收所得稅，</p>
<p>有限度膨脹通　，</p>
<p>上所記，約為當上馬博士　講之大意，（　建時先生　有他的講　紀錄）對於　的分析和結論，我　得很有研究的價値，但　不能完贊　，所以當時　　經很簡單　發博了我所不同的意見，此　我也引　的記載出來，　供研究，</p>
<p>對於馬博士的分析，我認為確實値得顧慮，但是他未免過於消極和悲觀了，我們試從國家的歲入和歲　兩方面夾估量一下，</p>
<p>從歲入方面說，一十四年度的總槪算，經臨兩門合計九五七，一五四，〇〇六元，其中關稅項下三四一，三六一，四〇〇元，（佔百分之三十五强）鹽税一八四，二一九，〇四四元，（佔百分之十九强）统税一一三，二九八，一七七元，（佔百分之十二弱）这三項收入，佔了國家純收入的絕對多數，假如馬博士的預言果眞實現，則國家財政將　絕境，但是事實並不如　簡單，即就關稅方　說，敵人雖能將我東南沿海對鎖，未必連廣州和香港的交通也斷絕，如其不然，則我國在非常時期的對外貿易，不至於完全沒有，列從鹽稅來說，將　沿海的主要鹽塲雖會遭受佔領，但是我們儘可預先多量　藏，何况四川的陆海井鹽，亦能供幾省的食用，誠使我國家的準備管理得宜，食鹽實行公賣之後，其收和就好不至於比現在鹽稅的數目還少，最後講到統稅，那就更複雜而伸縮性大了，如果政府和人民事前一無準備，所謂西南西北的建設計劃，只屬空言，自然統稅將無可收，否則政府而能領導和恊助人民實現下面怕略舉的「非常時期經濟政策」，則本國內地的幼稚工業，因為海口被對鎖，外貨少流入的關係，反能　盛起來，如此統稅也就不見得絕無希望，依照我上面的分析，我國非常時期的主要稅收，只會部分的减少，不會嚴　到如馬博士所談之甚，</p>
<p>單從歲入的多寡，　不足以判定　　的財政政策，所以我們還得對於歲出方面分析的研究一下，照廿四年度總預算表看來，歲出九五七，一五四，〇〇六元，其中最高之數，雖為軍費，（三二八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇）我們假定非常時期這項支出是要增加的，但是次於軍費的支出是　務費，總數一七厲害，八〇三，二七九元，其中內債本息金一四五，二二二，一九〇元，外債本息金四四，五五六，〇五七元，庚子賠欵三三，九〇八，七〇六元，借欵四〇，四四二，八五二元，這項去出，到了非常時期當然可以完全停付，再次的支出為補助費（一〇一，九八〇，〇八九元）及財務費（六六，〇一一，三四三元）敎育文化費，（三七，二一一，六二一元）關於財務和敎育兩項的支出，那時當然可以减少，其大部分补助费中之主要数目，乃对於各省将来应在国防建設項下總籌算，此外如國務黨務諸費，為數雖鮁不多，亦可各减少到一半以上，到於那时的支出数字，此刻誰者不能假定，要看環境和事實的要求，但是需要比平進擴大預算是無疑議的，</p>
<p>我於簡略的叙談過我國現時總　算之後，接續要到本題了，馬博士以徵收所得稅為非常時期財政上的主要對策，對於他這種主張，我非常懷疑，固然我是同情實行徵收所昨稅的，可是照財政部的估計，每年收入不過五百餘萬（總預算中列為五百萬元）但是除去現時對於公務人員已實徵四百餘萬元所昨捐外，只有一百多萬的好處，何况一到非常时期，公务人员僅能得受最低限度的维持费，那裏还有所得税可收呢，其他如敎員醫生律師工廠商店和銀行等處之職員，亦不免因受時事影響，而减少其收入，所得税当然也要减少，所以　所得税以充实非常时期的國家財政，不免近於　餅充饑了，（未完）</p>

<h3>昨與探捕發生衝突　電車公共汽車擊壞多輛　商店臨時停業雙方受傷　華董調停可望不致擴大</h3>
<p>大公社云、公共租界工部局人力車務委員會、前因限制車夫登記數、及减低車租、被車商反對、於本月一日罷市、嗣經互商解决、對於車租决定减低、但車夫登記、則繼續舉辦、定於昨日開始、但祇額定五千人、而車商則表示須無限制登記、昨晨、車夫之前往登記者、竟達二萬人之多、要求登記處增加名額、當因人多龐雜、發生紛擾、經捕房前往彈壓、結果有數人略受微傷、刻此事已經工部局華董出而調停、事態或不致擴大也、</p>
<p>額定五千到者二萬　人力車委會定淤本月十四日、在滬西麥根路舢舨廠新橋東、舉行車夫登記、但僅額定五千人、而車商方面、以爲上海之人力車、不下六七萬、雖有四萬人登記、未登記者仍多如有此限制、將使彼等有失業之虞、遂卽表示反對、要求繼賣無限制登記、昨日工部局乃在麥根路順德里人力車夫登記處、舉行登記、按照登記手續、車夫應先由車主以四月份捐照路單、向登記處領取申請書、然後保舉車夫、向登記處進行登記、其保舉方法、係每輛車或每二輛車推荐一人、三輛車推荐二人、上海共有車輛一萬、乃得推荐車夫五千人、但昨晨登記時、竟有二萬餘人、直接前往麥根路登記處耍求登記、以致秩序頗爲紊亂、</p>
<p>人多嘈雜發生紛擾　車委會登記處、本定於上午八時開始登記、而鑒於車夫到者甚多、一時秩序紛亂、竟無從開始進行、而是時有少數車夫、尙在高聲、呼請增加登記、當因車夫人數太多、自麥根路東盡頭之登記處起、至卡德路舢舨廠新橋咸爲車夫集中之區、一時交通幾被阻絕、斯時車夫之中、忽有數外來之暴徒、高聲要求增加登記、少數車夫、則附和之、於是遂發生紛擾、</p>
<p>車輛被毀交通斷絕　是時適有公共租界十路公共汽車經過卡德路麥根路一帶、復有十九路無軌電車、亦經卡德路麥根路、被人上前攔阻、加以毆擊、以石子小塊、擲擊車身、致損毁玻璃窗甚多、共達九輛、而車內乘客則無受傷、惟路上行人、見此情形、咸大爲驚懼、紛紛躲避、而後來之公共汽車及無軌電車、並其他車輛、恐作城魚、均不敢前往、公共租界方而、立由新閘捕房戈登路捕房等處、派出大批警士前往、並爲免使事態擴大。防止歹人混入起見、暫時令車輛斷絕往來、在舢板廠新橋之華租交界處、只准租界人民過橋至閘北、而不准閘北人民過橋至租界、並由捕房商得公安局新閘分局及市保安隊之同意、派警察保安隊駐守橋上、維持秩序、車夫中之紛擾、於九時</p>
<p>捕房彈壓各有微傷　十分發生、捕房方面、立卽派中西深捕、前往彈壓、是時略有紛擾、因車夫與警捕、互有衝突、結果、有車夫十人左右、被木棍所擊傷、分別送往醫院、（據捕房方面稱、僅有一人、因被推倒受傷、復有一人被捕房拘押、）西捕方面、則有一八五三號右眼被擊傷、手槍亦被擊落、現已送至寶隆醫院診治、因傷勢不大、可無大碍、尙有西探克勞·西副捕頭毛佛脫·被擊輕傷、更有華副捕頭陶士偉亦被石子擊傷、</p>

<h3>公共租界工部局衞生報吿</h3>
<p>上海之草帽業　中國徵信　主編　（上海工商業概况之廿二）</p>
<p>概述　上海草帽業分兩帮，一曰草帽出口行，　曰草帽製造廠，其營業性質，絕對不同，前者採取舶來原因，經人工手編，運銷國外，後者採取國產草辮，用機器製造，行銷國內，兩者組織互異，不通聲氣，惟其發展之速，與夫衰落之厲，則同出一轍也，考草帽出口，巳有二十年，其先在華洋行，利用我國工資低廉，以小呂宋之金絲草蔴草，發給寗波餘姚海鬥農戶編結，然後銷售各國，迨華商自設出口行，直接與國外商家貿易，各洋行因難以抗衡，遂相率放棄，民十九年爲出口草帽行全盛時代，嗣以各國購買力低落，兼受日本紙帽及意大利粗帽傾銷之影響，市面　落千丈，而原料供給問題，亦喧傳菲政府將禁止出口，頗起恐慌，回顧上海草帽廠自發軔以至褻落，爲時僅十餘年，在民十九年問，全市草帽廠，不下九十家，不旋踵而宣吿停閉者，比比皆是，近年內地小規模草帽廠之風起雲湧，亦上海草帽廠衰落之重要因素也。</p>
<p>草帽之原料及製造　草帽之原料分金絲草，蔴草，玻璃草，草辮等，金絲草蔴草產於小呂宋，玻璃草產於瑞士，草辮產於山中河北等省，以掖縣陽信滄縣南樂所出最負盛名，以價値論，玻璃草昂貴，大概每風草帽成本，玻璃草的一元三角，金絲草的八角，蔴草的八分，草辮爲麥桿編製，品質不一，高貨每包値一百五十元，粗貨値四十元，每包容量爲二百四十支，每支一百二十碼，每包可製草帽五十打，上海草辮行有恒豐，洪祥源，乾和永，洪昌祥等，民二十三年，日貨蠟綫辮進口，廠商感於利誘，經福源草帽廠試用，一時繼起仿傚者，頗不乏人，此種綫辮，係屬毛坯，須經上蠟編結手續，方能應用，現今上海蠟綫上蠟廠，有華成，和豐，公利三家，蠟綫編結廠有天綸鴻昌等，考日貨蠟綫，乃　種棉織品受潮發軟，不若我國草辮之經久耐用，苟用戶加以鑑別，當知日貨之疵點也。</p>
<p>草帽製造，分人工與機製兩種，人工編結，屬於上品，即爲出口貨　機器製造者，泰半屬粗决貨，即一班上下階級所用者也，我國寗波餘姚海門等處婦女，不論老幼，均視編織草帽爲副業，在全盛時代，達五十寓人，蓋手續簡便，易於學習，應用工具，祇立體圓木一塊，出口行在上述各地設立莊口，分給原料，託代編織，待製成後，視工作之優劣，按件給以工資，精於編結者，每五日可出帽一頂，普通每月亦能編二三頂，在民十九年問，每人按月工資，平均可得二三十元，惟此種計件辦法，流弊時起，或以决貨混充，或以成份减少，故現今行家，都發售原料，再向農戶收買，逮草帽跌價以後，出口行爲减輕成本起見，對於農戶工資，减低甚鉅，向之女工，平均得三十元者，今則不過十元，此輩結帽女工，須富有藝術思想，蓋國外草帽式樣，倏忽千變，時而高頂，時而平頂，出口行隨時留意，遇有變動，隨時用傳單，或鳴鑼通吿，彼輩亦樂予接受，寗波餘姚一帶，編結金絲，玻璃帽，海門則以蔴帽爲多，殆亦習慣便然耳。</p>
<p>上海草帽廠，製造時期，通常自一月至六月，過此時期，大廠織呢帽，小廠織便精，製草帽所用之機，普通採用勝家公司之草帽機，上海各廠，設備最多者，有草帽機二十二部，最少一部，全市的有五百部，製造步驟，　　將草辮盤製預定草帽之式樣，二·將毛坯草帽加以整理，三。加膠水用及立丁或牛皮膠，四·第一决烘燥，五·上壓機，六·裝布及皮圈，七·第二次烘燥。</p>
<p>草帽之種類　草帽之種類，因原料不同，名目繁多，嚴格分之，不下二百三十種，普通則分金絲帽蔴帽玻璃帽三種，金絲帽可分特超，超等，頭號二號三號四號五號决貨各種，蔴帽玻璃帽亦有超等，頭號二號三號四號五號次貨之區別，僅少特超一種耳，上海草帽廠所織草帽，向祗軟帽硬帽之分，自日貨蠟綫辮進口，乃有棉毛製品，及棉毛草辮混合製品，惟普通混稱草帽也。</p>
<p>草帽之營業　草帽出口季節，自九月至翌年四月，夏令國外添貨，僅屬偶然之事，澳洲生意，則在落令期中，賣買以定貨爲多，出口行在紐的，倫敦，巴黎，漢堡，均有代理人，行方隨時向國外各行，報吿貨品價格，以電報協商，倘有成交，行方即出立售貨單，記載花色數額價格及交貨日期，規定洋莊客戶，必須由銀行電吿開立銀行信用狀，亦有行方信用國外客戶，自行押匯或脫手裝去草帽出口同業公會，爲維護同業利益起見釐訂營業規程，其中第十條屬於國外洋行者，一·訂明開具銀行信用狀延不照辦者，二·無理退貨者，三·濫削貨價者，四·曾經倒閉或素無信用者得通吿同業，對洋行停止往來。（未完）</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （唐增庚）</p>
<p>每一個人，天才的平庸和高超，並不能斷定他未來的失敗和成就，生成着是一　平庸天才的，假使他能够努力，能够不畏一切艱鉅的埋首於苦幹硬幹之中，最後，他還是得到美滿的成功；反之，一個有着高超天才的，他一味的憑着自己的天才而傲慢而大意，結果呢？是深深地墮人了失敗的陷阱，所以，奉勸天下每一個平庸天才的朋友們，請你們不要因爲自己的天才平庸而喪失了努力的勇氣，亦不耍甘自落伍而消極；同時，那些有着高超天才的朋友，請你們切不可因爲自己的高超，而斷送了錦繡的未來，當然，也不能靠着自己的幸運而藐視着　切的。</p>
<p>靠天才而獲得的人生，那是苦澀的，乏味的，靠奮鬥而獲得的人生，那才是有意義的，可以値得歌頌的，朋友，眼前放着「天」和「奮鬥」的兩條路綫，你是選擇着那一條去　進呢？</p>

<p>江北鹽城，亦名瓢城，以其形似也。爲裏下河之一等縣，故於政治方面，則有專員駐在：於經濟方面，則中國交通農民三銀行，俱有分行；於交通方面，則北達阜寗，東達東臺，西南達泰州興化邵伯等處，咸通小輪，近更有阜滬外海輪，經過該縣南洋岸口，鹽與棉花之運出尤便，新計劃之鈸東鐵路，亦擬擴充抵此；是將來之繁榮可期待也。</p>
<p>鹽城敎育極發達，升學者亦多，大學畢業生總數有一千左右，在江蘇可首屈一指。惟其所學大都文法科，無事在家，則辦小報，因是有健訟之風。近來專　施奎齡，創息訟運動，恐亦無濟於事。一般人民，皆樸實耐勞苦，善積蓄，日常生活，雖屬布衣蔬食，然偶遇荒歉，絲亳不受影響。較之蘇滬一帶人，身上穿得綢翩翩，家中沒有夜飯米者，不可同日而語。</p>
<p>裏下河各縣，如泰州東臺興化鹽城等處，娼妓甚夥，故有「到了與化心開放，到了鹽城不想家」之諺。以鹽城一縣城而論，據云不下二百餘家。平時並不花枝招展，出外賣弄風騷；欲問津者，報以和酒，始得留髡。北地燕脂，有異於南朝金粉矣。</p>
<p>鹽城南鄕有鎭曰卞倉，以枯枝牡丹著名，鏡花緣說部中亦載其事。惟所說稍異於鹽城縣志。縣志略云：元末卞元亨入張士誠幕，頗多建樹，洎士誠敗，隱居鹽瀆卞倉，明太祖徵之不出，怒，遺戍遼左，瀕行以酒　其手植牡丹曰，待我南還花再開，自是不復含蕾，凡十稔。一歲風雪中，作花甚奢，元亨竟以赦歸。厥后本被盜於鹺使，植官舍，日萎見棄，卞氏拾其枯者，培之又芽，久而彌茂，遂稱枯枝牡丹。色分紅白，占地可半畝，夏之蓉詩云，奇哉卞氏雙珠花，白如香雪紅朝霞，卽詠此也，每年穀雨，四方人士之來觀者，屑摩踵接，盛及一時。乙亥春，余以講學餘晷，曾往玩賞，紀有一律云：何處牡丹好？淮南有卞倉，枯枝傳異穩，絕色信眞王；更得雙珠譽，自留千載芳，令辰逢穀雨，我亦爲花忙。今者花柳春風，令長又將屆矣，江南雅客，其有興來一游乎！</p>
<h3>尋妻廣吿</h3>
<p>— 儷琴</p>
<p>走失了人口，就得張貼出若干張尋人廣吿，這好像已成了尋人方法的一定公式了，而這廣吿的寫法，也有一定的格局：一幅狹長的紙上，上端橫寫着兩個很大的字，「尋人」，又把這尋人的「人」字，顚倒寫成了「人」字；人字倒寫，這其間包含着音韵學，心理學，希望心，吉口利等等諸般因素；再說明白一點，就是人倒人到，出門有利，這張廣吿一經張貼出去，那未走失了的人馬上就會尋回來，這種話雖覺幼稚可笑，却是我們中國自有五千年歷史以來的因襲而成的「國風」，茅山道士盡了一道符籙就會召請天神天將去捉拿妖怪，諸如此類的奇妙之談，都可歸納在這一圈子的裏面。除了人字倒寫的格局以外，其餘的詞句，寫起來也有一定的程式，例如：開首先寫「今因走失××一口」，以下接寫的，說明這走失者的姓名，年齡，面貌，身材，籍貫同口音，以及走失時身上穿的衣服的式樣質料等等，末了因爲覺到自己的找尋力量够不到，便帶着詢問的口氣而籲請「仁人君子，如有知其下落，因而尋獲送到某地某處者：酬洋若干。」懸賞尋人，理所當然，聖人說過：「君子喻於義，小人喻於利。」中國不是「鏡花緣」裏的純粹君子國，社會的機搆，是由君子與小人的二階段混合組職而成，所以耍仰仗他人的大力之處，如果不顧到義務與權利的一方面的不平衡，而不預　把這輕重擔子拉成了一條水平綫，那麼有誰個君子或小人來玉成其美？這一種附帶條件，確然算得合乎社會哲　的邏輯了。最後緊接「酬洋若干」之處，特別又加上一截尾巴：「儲欵以待，决不食言」，這一截尾巴加得也很必耍，而且又落落大方；因爲不如此不足以呌人曉得他的口袋裏的法幣是麥克麥克的。總而言之，這種章法，是很絲絲入扣，無懈可擊的。自從最初發明或創造的人傳下這個典型以來，後人遇着走失人口，要寫上幾張尋人廣吿，總是如法泡製，依樣盡葫；沒有誰　膽敢違反這個法則的。可是最近被我發見了，丹陽延陵在某，這位朋友不幸走失了他的老婆，他沒有法幣登報，就抄老文章寫上幾百張「尋妻廣吿」張貼在四鄕八鎭的巷口街頭，可是無論那堵牆壁上一經貼上他的「尋妻廣吿」，就轟動了許多人來駐足而觀，這一種吸引力就在於他的「尋妻廣吿」的章法，一反從前的程式：可說是自有尋人廣吿以來的革命第一砲，而日妙趣環生，大有孔聖人被圍陳蔡而仍不輟絃歌的觥觥氣度。下面附錄的，就是「尋妻廣吿」的原文：「梅霞吾妹愛鑒：爲何一去不回？老母憂急成疾，兒女啼飢號寒；日間四處找尋？夜間腸　九轉；家中一切事情，弄得無入經管。自從結婚以來，光陰倏忽五載，吾亦待你不惡，你竟當我洋盤：日常出外遊玩，夜深更盡歸來；有時在外過夜，倒說奉陪姊妹；究竟啥格路道，算吾大倒其霉！如此鐵石心腸，拋却家務不管，我雖在外工作，每月只有八塊，生活非常艱難，經濟方面不寬。昨日岳母來舍，與吾大哭小喊；限吾三天裏頭，定要呌吾尋還；若不依限尋來，呌吾如何交代；否則將欲起訴，眞眞性命交關　望你回心轉意，見字速卽回來！萬勿受人利誘，以免將來懊悔。以念夫妻情深，寶鏡可以重圓，决不查究旣往，保持雙方情愛。登報沒有法幣，只能紙上發言，若仍在外不歸，我將欲尋短見；望你大發慈悲，勿再使吾爲難！特此忠言敬吿，梅霞妹妹吾愛。」</p>
<h3>雨後春筍</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>跳舞</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>跳舞救國」這句話，現在雖已過去了，可是今年的上每，眞可說得是「跳舞年」。大致這個年頭兒，喊口號的時期已過，而已進了實行時期了。</p>
<p>「跳舞」，一個男子，擁着一個女入，跟着音樂的調子一顚一縱，一個向前進，一個向後退那麼的踱着方步兒，這原是西方人的一種玩意。有些愛說「我們中國也有」的先生們，說的「舞」在我國二代時，已有。但是，得認淸，我國古代的舞，可總沒有一個男的，摟着一個女的那麼個樣兒「舞」的吧。有人說，跳舞是挺衛生的，這是戶內運動之一種。　是，我見沈迷跳於舞，而肌瘦面黃，神魂顚倒者矣，我未見有因跳舞，而延年却病者也。怕的要依跳舞，而增進健康，正和每天吸雅片，以治病，同樣的有些那個罷。</p>
<p>西方人對於跳舞，目爲交際之一種，是一種高尙的娛樂。自然，「我們中國也有」，不瞧見對外賓歡迎歡送，都得舉行茶舞會麼？　是跳舞這一回子事，在外國，也不見得是絕對的高尙。紐約巴黎等地的舞女，便老是那麼的富有着誘惑性。我們中國，自然也有。在這裏？——在一塊錢跳八隻，跳十雙，甚至於一塊錢跳十二雙的小舞塲裏。在那裏，是充滿着紐的巴黎等地夜總會中所具備的色彩的。</p>
<p>一塊錢十雙，以至十二雙，可謂已書「價廉」之能　了。但是這年頭兒，生意眞是難做，舞塲老闆，也不能例外，因爲精明的舞客，都紛紛地自帶着以更廉的價格，雇來的舞伴入塲，以致舞女終宵坐着「荐頭店」，分文無着，冷淸淸地與討着一盃白開水，自始至終安着「拆字攤」的不舞者，遙遙相對着。供應者與消費者，過者過，剩者剩，這或許在經濟學家目光中，大有文章可做。然而事實吿訴我們，舞塲老闆，却沒一個不是眉心打着結，嘆氣連連，雖然今年是一個十足不扣的「跳舞年」。</p>
<h3>聲明</h3>
<p>茲據阿鴛先生來函，謂三月四日「一春無事爲花忙」專頁中署名企東之「水仙」一篇，實抄　其曾刋他報之舊作，似此文賊，實屬可惡云云。企東不知爲何許人，除取消其潤資外，更予以名譽上之懲戒，特此聲明。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>楔子　賞菊近重陽尋幽小集　聯珠溫舊夢飮恨千秋</p>
<p>蘭厂對我將茶碗一舉，笑說：你先喝碗茶，再翻閱文件。在沒有看文件以前，不必去胡猜。若是像你這樣神經過敏，那就我今天所請的客，都成了書中人了。他這樣一說，倒顯着我這人太多心，我就依了他的話，先凝了一凝神，喝了幾口茶，然後把布包打開，見裏面是厚厚的三個書本子。那本子是藍布面，黃綢書簽，上寫含悲集三個字。將那三本書，我都翻了一翻，全是很秀媚的行書寫的手抄本。其中有日記，有詩，有書信，甚至帳單也有，完全是一種不曾整理的稿件。這稿件是關於某人的一生，那是可以斷言的。不過這種文字，走馬看花，是看不出頭緒來的，我只好放下。另外有一疊宣紙詩箋，朱絲格子，間有仿古式的鐘鼎圖案，印在上面。箋上也是一筆很流利的蘇字。上面一行題目是石點館新聯珠，下寫惜玉外史戲擬。我說：這詩箋又是一個人的筆墨，怎麼回事？蘭厂說：呵！是的。那阮先生說，這文件裏，有二十四首聯珠，只要把這聯珠念上一遍，你就知道了。我於是把這詩箋移到茶几中間，將椅子拖得和蘭厂並排，兩人同看。每首聯珠上，都記有號碼，我就看第一首是：</p>
<p>蓋聞蘭生空谷，流泉度其孤芳，月落秋階，蒼鶴憐其皓魄。是以高山一曲，焦桐託生死之交．落花無言，巾車感相逢之晚。</p>
<p>我就點點頭說：對了，這是說兩個人交情的開始。但是一開塲，就帶着傷感的意味呢。蘭厂說：你先不用挿嘴，往下看。於是掀開第二張詩箋，看第二首。</p>
<p>蓋聞二南之叶，好逮爲往晢所不能諱言。三問之辭，鐘情亦騷人所有以自託。故銅溝流翠，有緣得葉上之詩，彩鳳求凰，憐才悟零中之意。</p>
<p>蓋聞春風巷陌，絲柳情長。烟雨江頭，盡樓夢冷……</p>
<p>我看到下面八個字，覺得有些費解，就不免把手撑起來托着下巴，出神的想了一想。不料在這個時候，蘭厂不會注意到我，巳經看過好幾首去了。我便停止了揣想，接着向下看第八首。</p>
<p>蓋聞求三年之艾，雖扁鵲莫起沉疴。索十萬之錢，是天孫允須重聘。故灰盡万心，商女不知亡國恨。撑將淚眼，落花猶似　樓人。（九）</p>

<p>查暹　政府自前年頒布所謂强迫敎育條例後凡居留該國之華童、均須攻讀暹文、當時僑胞雖一致反對、但以孤立無援、結果卒歸失敗、嗣後華即紛紛停辦、或被暹政府無理對閉、所留存之寥寥數校、亦均改授暹文、即所謂强近敎育班是也、僅少數超過該國規定學齡　之華童、方能敎授中文、至於受强迫敎育之華童、每週雖有敎授中文五六小時之規定、但以時間過少、實不足支配、請求增加時間、但以時間過少、實不足支配、請求增加時間、暹政府又不許、不得已、各華校祗能於上午上課、及下午散課後、（暹羅因氣假突熱故普通下午三時後即行放學）酌授中文若干時、藉謀補救、不意此種不得已之辦法、規定除暹文外、修身·算術·常識·衛生·圖畫·童軍等必修科、仍須用暹文課本外、一年級至二年級、每　有五時二十分鐘為選科時間、四年級與　年級、每週有十　小時二十分為選科時間（暹學制五年畢業）在此選科時間內、可選讀英文法文或中文、而上課時間、規定自上午九時起至下午二時止、止課前與放學後、不許再延長時間、而選修課本、（指中文課本）須送該國敎育部審查、批准後方可採用、此項新例、表面上似與華人有利、因四五年級敎授中文之時間、　過去略增、然實筆法上反得不償失、蓋　課外不能再增加敎授中文之時間也、</p>

<h3>復興民族與救濟流浪兒童（一）</h3>
<p>— 雷震</p>
<p>全國兒童年實施委員會播音講演</p>
<p>今天兄弟來和諸位討論復興民族與救濟流浪兒童問題、現在的兒童是民族未來的中堅、國家未來的主人翁、這是誰都知道不用費詞解釋的事、一個人一生的習慣·個性·品行·好　都是由於童年時其養成、所以就個人來說、童年的修養是一生事　的基礎、就民族和國家來說、兒童敎育便是民族國家盛衰根本、我們的民族國家自從以前承襲亡清積弱之後、民國成立二十多年、社會秩序不能得到案寗、政治不能澄清、學術不能進步、而農村破產、商業停滯、各種產業日趨凋敝、這種病象的　結、固然不是單純的原因、但是過去對於兒童敎育之忽視、實在是主要原因之一、須要知道一個人在童年時代養成了自私、攘奪偷惰、無恥等等惡習、長成後即為社會之不良份子、故今日盜匪·貪汚·拆白·十之八九係當年之不良兒童、故欲復興民族、對於兒童敎育、必須亟起直追的　去、</p>
<p>現在我閃試探討我國兒童敎育的情形·我國學齡兒童、據敎育部民國二十一年度調查的數目是四千九百六十八萬八千九百一十七人在這四千九百餘萬學齡兒童中在學兒童、只有千　百二十　萬三千零六十六人、失學兒童數目是三千七百四十六萬五千八百五十一人、我們試、計算、失學兒童的數目超過在學兒童竟有三倍之多、在學兒童的敎育情形如何、我們現在不必討論、我們現在要討論的是失學兒童何以如此之多、兒童失學依據兄弟　觀察、大槪有　種原因、</p>
<p>第一種原因、是小學設備之供不應求、現在全國的小學據敎育部　十一年度的統計、全國的數目為二十六萬　千四百三十　校而且是分布在都市城鎭的多、因為小　不拘容納學齡兒童、所以有　部失學兒童是無處攻讀、此種失學情形、出於不得已、關於此點、敎育正在積極　法、力行義務敎育、增設小學、擴充原有小學之容納數量、本年因推行　年短期義務敎育、可增加就學兒童四百萬人預戎五年之後可使百分之七八十的學齡兒童都有就學的機會、</p>
<p>第二種原因、是兒童父母的頑固心理、在過去宗法社會的情形之下、國人對於自己的兒女、因認為是家族傳種接代的後代根並未認清他的兒女是國家的一個小國民、所謂「人留兒女草留根」、所以父母對於兒女、多只肯養其成人而不思敎其成為國家有用這國民、有產者之子女、則終年　縱慣養、聽其度浪漫頹靡之生活、不顧其將來對社會所生之惡影響、無產者之子女、則携事隨從父母帮助耕種、或同作苦工、而不思使其就學識字、兒童因此失學者所在多有、此種情形、將來義務敎育實行後强近入學、失學兒童亦可减少、</p>
<p>第三種原因、便是我閃怕要辦的流浪兒童問題、這種流浪兒童、是現在的社會所最不重視而對將來的社會為害最大的失學失養兒童、現在我們在都市或鄉鎭裏、時常可以看見許多乞兒的小孩子、度著野獸一般的生活、檢煤子、拾破布、討剩飯、偷柴草、日裏在拉圾堆邊打架、夜裏在小店的灶　邊倒臥、這種孩子有的是沒有父母的孤兒、有的是農村破立後災民的子女、這種兒童、一般人看他們、比猪狗不如、受盡社會的輕視和虐待、旣受不到知識的陶融、也求不到職業的技藝、長成以後、貧無所歸、便變成盜匪、帮票·前綹尋細、尤其是他們兒童時代、受盡人類之不幸的待遇、便養成了、冷酷、無恥的心理、所以這類兒童長成後、叵是做了盜匪、便是殘忍酷虐的殺人兇犯、若是做了奸細、便是毫無羞恥的狡賊、他們因為沒有人生的顧忌、的怪是不怕國法、不畏人言、不知道德、不顧廉恥、刑罰不足以嚇、禮義不足以制裁、從積極的方面說、在這般流浪兒童中、不知道埋沒有多少有為的天才、遺棄了多少有用的國民、從消商業方面說、擾亂國家治安、危害民族生存、都是這些失敎養的人們作出來的、出此言之我們要復興民族、不可不積極的討論救濟流浪兒童的辦法、</p>
<p>我們現在試一考慮我國現有救濟流浪兒童的組織、現在救濟流浪兒童的唯一組織、便是孤貧敎養院、據敎育部二十二年統計、全國省市立孤貧敎養　有六所、縣市立的有九十五所、私立的五十七所、合計全國的孤貧敎養院、祇有一百五十八所、所收容的兒童、祇有一五千七百七十二人、諸位試想、我們全國的失學兒童有三千上百四十多成人、失學兒童中的流浪兒童、恐怕單以一個都市而言、也不祇一萬多人、　此說全國的孤貧敎養院、不夠收容一個都市的流浪兒童·這樣的救濟、實是太不濟事了、現時我們雖然在積極推行義務敎育、但是義力敎育祇能救濟失學兒童、對於救濟流浪兒童仍鮁沒有　力、因為義務敎育、只負　敎而不負責養、救濟流浪兒童是要敎養兼施、而且還要謀兒童成年時的出路、所以救濟流浪兒童必須另想辦法、</p>

<h3>國貨界與政界之合作</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>一昨中華工業國外貿易協會中華國貨產銷合作協會，公宴實業部長吳達詮先生於銀行俱樂部，出席者除行政院工廠視察專員外，均爲上海實業界領袖，經營國貨事業之有力分子。行政界與工商界相聚一堂，彼此發表其改進實業之意見，與訴述工廠之疾苦，恍似一家人相見，質直無隱，頗得沆瀣一氣之象，信爲十數年來未有之情景。吳氏之言：首以各工廠在此外貨傾銷，市面不景氣之下，各工廠能以自力求進步，使所有出品，日新月異，日有進步，頗有駕舶來品而上之勢，此則極可敬佩。惟事業之進展，與其恃他力，不如仗自力。國貨工業當求自力更生，自己有進步，自己求精美，則本國貨品，自然爲入樂用，不能强人，亦不必勸人。目下國貨工業應取之途徑，不可在營業上作無謂之競爭，或粗製濫造，以貶損國貨之價値。當在技術上求精進，成本上求低廉，效能上求便捷，而如何使舉國人士之愛用國貨，其推動力亦在國貨界自身；如何使產銷合作，以推及於全國與國外亦在實業界自身。我國今日機械工業，尙在幼雅時代，不妨採取「生產工具，歡迎外貨，銷費物品，專用國產，」爲過渡時代之辦法。此後能自給自足，尤仗國貨界之努力如何。而席間實業界諸君所提出之希望，則在各廠原料稅之發還，以示鼓勵。同業公會組織，應厚其力量，不稍通融。各省工業之設置，應統籌全局，有全盤整個之計盡，不使重複，不涉偏枯，而歸結於隨時交換意見，彼此接洽，如某一問題之討論，可與宮廳相聚一堂，互述意思，以祛除巳往之隔閡，與無謂之官樣文章。此種官民一致之精神，澦卜國貨界前途之無限希望。吳氏自長部以來，努力扶助國貨工業，設置商務官於國外，組織農本局，派員調查各地工業，在在予中國實業以發展之便利，此後行政界與實業界携手合作之機會正多，此爲首决之盛集，敢懸無限之期望，以騐未來之展布何如？</p>

<h3>對於國貨飛行機的認識</h3>
<p>— 孟</p>
<p>方纔欣幸去年十二月份和今年一月份對外貿易的出超新紀錄！可是江海關發表滬市二月份對外貿易輸出减少，進口又增加，又轉入超，入超額爲一七·七七七·三九一元，然則十二月份的出超一·〇八〇·〇〇〇元，與廿五年一月份的出超一·三九二·〇七三元又何濟於事？國人對於提倡國貨與服用國貨，應格外加緊進行，多多認識，務須達到對外貿易，有月月出超的可能，因此，筆者對於中國海軍飛機製造處自製的雙翼水·陸兩用機，能採用國貨材料，異常可貴！據報載「該機係供練習飛行之用，故除駕駛員外，尙可坐一人，僅發動機係購自美國外，所有五金，磁漆，杉木，蓬布，一切零星物件，均爲國貨」云云。</p>
<p>吾們知道國貨救國與航空救國並重，認識飛行的興趣，更其要認識提倡國貨的與趣，「我們有國貨的飛行機了！」大家可以拍掌稱快喊着響亮的口號來！</p>
<h3>南京呂冕南博士　硏究提煉汽油成功</h3>
<p>— 瘦</p>
<p>每噸煤可煉十加侖　其他副產物亦不少</p>
<p>在這幾十年來，中國的一切事業，都是非營發達，尤其是汽車事業：和航空事業；都是一日千里，有長足的進步。這，自然是我們引爲欣慰的。可是無論什麼事情，總得詳細的觀察一下，汽車和航空事業，日漸發達，固然是一種好現象。但是另一方面，我們要想想汽車和飛機所用的必需品——汽油——究竟是那裏來的？凡是稍有相當常識的人，總知道我國是沒有汽油出產的。所以現在所用的汽油，都是仰給於英，美，俄，等國，在從前，這汽油的漏巵，還不怎樣的驚人，可是自從汽車飛機兩種事業發達以後，汽油的輸入，可就使人昨舌了，據過去的報紙記載；每年汽油的漏巵總在好幾千萬元。雖然是在國貨年中，這種汽油的輸入額，依然是日有增加，因爲汽車飛機，沒有汽油作燃料，是不能開動的，而且除了仰給外貨以外，竟沒有國貨代替，於是祗好忍痛使用外貨了！</p>
<p>汽油的原料，據說是由煤裏面提煉出來的。煤的出產，在我國是很豐富的，尤其是山西省，更到處都有媒鑛。如果國人能够提煉的話，則這種原料，——煤——是不會缺乏的，不但可以自給，或者還可以供給國外呢！可惜一般人沒有注意到這　點，任令外貨汽油，源源輸入，這是多麼痛心的一件事！</p>
<p>首都建設委員會化學試騐室的主任呂冕南博士，他是一個有心人，他在幾年前已經注意到這一層了：經過他幾年來的研究，對於提煉汽油，已獲有相當的成綪，——也可以說是相當的成功。他煉汽油的原料，是烟煤：各處的烟媒，他都提煉過，最好的，是江西樂平縣所產的烟煤。提煉的方法，大槪有兩種：第一是低溫蒸溜：但是每　噸煤——千六百八十斤——低能煉十加侖汽油，不過副產物，如焦煤；柏油；非樂爾是很多的。第二是輕化提煉：每一噸煤可以煉很多的油，然而却沒有副產物，兩相比較，還是低溫蒸溜來得合算，所以現在還是採用第一種的辦法，他巳經煉了不少决數，成續是很好的。</p>
<p>據說：烟煤提煉汽油的時候，有好幾分別，第一次的呌做輕油，這是作汽油用的。第二次呌做中油；第三次的呌做重油；中油和重油，不能再煉汽油，但是可以提煉燈油；（卽媒油）和機器油的，最後的就是油渣，可以製成柏油和石臘，並且非樂爾還可以製造電木器具。所以這種煉油，是很合算的。</p>
<p>他們的提煉汽油，總算是成功了！第二步自然應該設廠製造了。可是資本　層，倒也成爲問題，大概最低的限度，要一百多萬元。他們正在計劃着一到了相當的時期，就要呈請實業部准予專利了！我們很希望他們這個設廠製造的計劃，能够早日實現。</p>
<p>關於提煉的手續，因爲限於篇幅，等有機會的時候，再來報吿吧！</p>
<h3>組織兒童國貨服用團的必要</h3>
<p>— 系</p>
<p>兒童的意識幼稚，經騐薄弱，什麼事情都容易上人勾當，就拿兒童購買　西　事來講：往往給　般常用着花言巧語的奸商騙購許多洋貨，因爲兒童只要貨色好看，大都對於這東西底來路屬國貨遝屬洋貨這事忽略了，其實，也難怪他們，在校裏在家中有誰去時常指出國貨與洋貨區別的地方呢？們所聽到大人們的指導的僅是「服用國貨」「不買洋貨」等抽象的名詞。所以，我們今後要使兒童的的確確能做到大家不買洋貨而服用國貨實踐的一步，那就有積極組織兒童國貨服用團的必要。</p>
<p>兒童國貨服用團：就是便兒童相互規勉，彼此督察，做到大家小買洋貨，大家服用國貨的一步。團內也可由兒童自己推出　員五人或七人組織委員會，務使大家分任這類工作。至於怎樣不買洋貨？怎樣服用國貨？怎樣辨別洋貨與國貨？怎樣處置購買洋貨的兒童？怎樣檢察兒童購買的東西等等雜亂而迫切的問題，自然由他們（兒童）在會議上共同討論出好的　法，敎師只站在輔導的地位，指示兒童一切關係國貨常議及服用國貨一方法。</p>
<p>總之：各地如能都組織了兒童國貨服用團以後，使兒童對於國貨與洋貨的認識確可增進不少的觀察力，日大家一定還能養成自服用國貨的習慣。對於國貨前途確有莫大的裨益，謹希各地負有敎育兒童責任的先生們！趕快指示兒童組織兒童國貨服用團吧。</p>

<h3>衰弱——癆瘵</h3>
<p>— 兪伯符</p>
<p>癆瘵一症。患者最多。轻重不一。而要以身體衰弱者最易患之。蓋衰弱者對於抵抗病魔之力。至爲薄弱。病菌易染。作祟迅劇。故身體衰弱者。允宜速求所以回復壯健之道也。</p>
<p>夫衰弱症狀。紛歧不一。大都由於生殖腺內分泌缺乏。以致神經衰弱而起。故共治法自以生殖腺製劑爲最對症。則神經繁榮。血旺精足。身壯體健。且生殖腺內分泌旺盛者。不惟生機蓬勃。且抵抗病魔之力。亦極强大。</p>

<p>性病治法。如能兼就著名之性病專家施行電療。則治療期可更迅速。如內服名藥自療。則下列兩大名藥爲最效。</p>
<p>「希米脫氏固精片」。治遣精。固精關。臨睡吞服三片。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言湖南籌辦妓女學校  家為　　這或許是令人可嘉的事吧，我們今日的社會確在不斷的「建設」，不斷的「改善」中了！可不是嗎，什麼「經濟建設」，「航空建設」，「國防建設」，「××建設」，以至什麼「節儉運動」，「母敎運動」，「土貨運動」，「××運動」……，許多許多轟轟烈烈地都說是為「謀」改革今日的社會國家而「建設」，「而運動」！　　果眞，我閃雖沒有清楚地兒到這些事例的效果與成績究竟怎樣，但是，在當局「煞費苦心」地提倡與推行之下，或許終可以暫時給予人們些微的興奮與刺激嗎？　　就在今日的報端，我們又發現了一個事例，據載——　　湖南表運會，擬開辦妓女學校一所，計劃能納五百名。授以刺　縫級各種手藝，並國語珠算等應用科。先行辦理登記，妓女經登記後，即舉行考試，就考試成績，分別程度，以便分班敎練。其畢業期間，至多二年，至少年；每日課程六小時，一如普通學校。一班畢業後，續將以後登記者列入敎練。刻此項計劃，正在籌備進行，預計可於今歲秋間實現云。　　本來，我們還記得，在不久以前，有妓女舞女要進校讀書竟不得其門而；更有以母親出賣肉體為生而其子女就被學校當局拒之門外等事，是聞之又的了。而他們的理由是：因為要防腐化了其他「良家子弟」，更恐影響了學校聲譽。然而，這些「理由」是不是有着事實的根據，尚屬疑問；但是，在這里却終於十足地反應了我們這舊社會的病態，跟一部份人的社會心理！所以，今日，在湖南，能有專為敎育被人歧視而遺棄的妓女的學校畢辦，不能不說一件差强人意的事！　　然而，歷來我們所見到的各地方當局所謂「廢娼」，「禁娼」，以至「公娼」等等，那些「寓禁於徵」的變相徵稅辦法，正相反地增加着妓女們的負担與通苦，而永不得到一個正確的出路！　　所以，今日湖南當局的舉辦，「妓女學校」，確可說是「廢娼」聲中的一個新面目！　　不過，話又得說回來啦，在這樣「斬草不除根」的辦法之下，在當前的環境之下，我們能夠受到其預料中的效果嗎？木匠的兒子  巖　　這一番裝腔做勢，把同伴都引笑了。小花兒的爸雖然扭紅了臉，但他心里正說不出的高興着：小花兒再一年要畢業了呵！　　小花兒實在太總敏，又用功，好像他比同學們多生一點什麼，卽是課外的問題，他沒有答不上來的。回到家來，他總在那張小書桌上做功課，等爸回來一同吃夜飯。但是今天爸回來不見小花兒，問媽，說早回家來了。這屋子除了正門通大街之外，就是後門上河邊去了，但爸開了後門喊着小花兒的名字，沒有人答應。天色將完全落黑了，河面上還有一些亮光反射過來，爸打起手照瞧去，有一團黑影坐在何邊的樹根下，是穿着一套光荣的衣服的，是縣立小學校的制服呵！於是木匠爸跑過去了，當他把兒子抱起來的時候，他瞧見兒子的眼眶里蓄着清涙。這是從來沒有的事，兒子講過書本上的故事，做人不應該有哭的時候，無論什麼艱難的呈都要打起精神做去，那末，這個講故事的小學生為什麼哭起來呢？　　爸和媽用了許多好話盤問自己的兒子。兒子講了下面的一席話：　　一個同學遺失了一枝自來水筆，梭長來檢查敎室的時候，那枝筆在我的抽屜里搜了出來。他們都扮着鬼臉罵我是偷兒。校長帶我到敎務室里盤問我，我實在沒有偷，我不知那枝筆從那兒來的？校長明天要爸一同到學校去…　　木匠爸跳了起來，他知道自己的定貝决不会倫人家东西的。他想马上到學校去責問校長，兒子再一年是要畢業了！一個縣立小學畢業生該是如何高貴的呵！　　但是他馬上想起兒子講的故事來了，無論什麼艱難的事都要打起精神做去，做人不應該有哭的時候！於是他又坐下來拍着兒子的肩頭低地熱異常地問：　　「告訴爸爸，你倒底沒有偷那枝自來筆嗎？」　　兒子張大了眼睛注視着爸，仰不懂爸為什麼不信任兒子的話呢？　　那邊煤油燈光下映着媽的臉，鎖着眉毛，咬着下嘴唇，她也怀疑兒子做偷兒嗎？　　木匠的兒子小花兒大放聲哭了……　　（完）　　你這可怕的惡魔又來了！  椿年殺人的惡魔  除邪　　在上面這一張圖畫裏面，有一個惡魔，睜着慾眼，張着巨口，显出很可怕的樣子。　　這惡麼就是像微着瘟疫的毒菌，瘟疫的毒菌每年要殺人幾千萬，並且菌體極小，人的目力看不見，所以牠的禍害實在比較圖中的魔怪還要利害！　　現在這可怕的魔怪（瘟疫）又來了，我們如果能注意防範，也可以氫這麼怪殺滅，那就是每天要用「亞林防疫臭水」（五洲大藥房出品）在各處澆酒，殺滅菌類，使物們無法寄生，那麼病源旣絕，疾息自免，這　在是最簡便最有效的防禦方法了。醉  牧野　　夜深了，這爿小酒店里客人們在燈影搖曳中漸漸地散去，那位年輕而漂亮的女店主，仍然是堆着嫵媚的笑臉，嚮着銀鈴一樣地嗓子說笑着；向着每個客人親熱的告別，嘴里招呼着：「明天早點兒來，呵……。」於是牠一面把數好了的錢就：「光郎」的一下扔到竹筒子造成的錢櫃里去。牠就再轉過臉來向着另一個……　　客人漸漸地散完了，最後，就只剩下了李大魁。　　每天總是他落後的，他喝酒也喝得最多，勁兒最大的白乾至少也要來他斤半，他底酒量大嗎？不，他比誰都要醉的利害！有時候醉得人事不省的簡直像一堆爛泥。他是一個少了一隻眼睛的軍官，他常向人家講起在火綫上一鼓氮殺掉十三人的事，那眼睛就是給人家在斜刺里一顆子彈打掉了。他脾氣暴燥的很，肇禍是常有的事，看吧，在別的桌上可以坐七八個人或者再多些，他的桌上就只有一個人，別人都遠地躱開了。有時候他說了：「到我這個桌上來呵，咱們大夥兒談談，怕什麼？我又不是個吃人的　虎。」但是並沒有誰敢去冒那個險。如果眞有人坐過去，他就把臉一翻，大聲的呌着：「滚开呵，我要砍你，看你怕不怕……。」结果人家也只好陪笑着躱開了。　　女店主對他是沒有辦法的，對於這個客人她特別感到是難以應付他如果發起了脾氣來，打霈了東西，趕走了別的客人，這當然一筆沒有代價的捐失。可是，他每次會賬時，總是糊里糊塗的抓下了大把錢或鈔票。（比他所消費的要多上幾倍的數目。）女店主也就不聲不嚮地高高興興地收下來了。　　他已經喝醉了，嘴里吐着含　糊不清的言語，他省軍區盪着一顆無力的被火酒燒紅了的腦袋，眼睛眯成了一條綫，沒有光煇，臉上的肌肉鬆弛着，他莫名其妙的在微笑他咕嚕着：「喂…小嫂子…你…你…哼！」……他突然狂笑起来，那笑是那麽奇特的倒像是哭一样地凄惨，他寬大的胸部肩頭隨着笑聲而抖動，他滑稽的伸出了舌頭。做出了各式各樣的醜陋的怪相來。　　店夥們都嘻的笑了，瞧瞧李大魁，又瞧着女店主，又把视綫集中到李大魁。　　「天哪！又醉了　…」女店　自己像是在抱怨着誰似的，她又放大了聲音向着李大魁：「天不早了，快回去吧　什麼時候，還不走，眞是……」（未完）特寫海軍江南造船所第三塢落成禮  雨　　昨午，天氣怪陰暗的，似乎快要下雨的樣子。　　許多破舊衣服的男人和女人雜在藍布灰服的工人隊伍里，向「海軍江南造船所」高大的門戶連笑說的跑進去：「今天進塢的兵船怪大的吶」！　　也許是他們都住在造船附近的而且常常上那兒去玩的，很熟悉地跑進了第三船塢。　　很快的，這些跑進去的，又增厚了包　船塢的陣綫，海軍站在他們的前面，障礙了他們的前進。　　第三船塢的確是很大的，望上去好像小湖那麼的。塢的二端是二條橋，靠黃清江的那條浮橋便時閘門。塢的沿邊是鋼板，身子是木製的，梯形的。都上了黑的柏油，也許上了不久吧，柏油氣味還是那樣濃厚的</p>
<p>Page 18</p>
<p>塢的四周掛着鮮明的萬國旗。塢腰的空間，紅白藍三條綢帶橫橫地掛三個三色的紅白藍的彩球。　　抽水機房是在閘門的右首。拖重機有五架分裝在塢的兩邊。　　禮台，臨時的設在里邊的橋上，很簡單的，一張總理遺像，二隻花瓶。　　禮台旁漸漸地集合了十來位海軍部軍官，制服都是怪挺的，指揮刀黃色把手被捏在白色手套里，更顯出他們的威武來。他們的手不時的在帽沿上碰着。　　就在這當兒，同地平綫一樣高的閘門，漸漸由水下浮上來，超過地綫有四五尺高。二根鐵纜繫住了這閘門，在二架拖重機拖動下，閘門離開原來的地位，在閘口外黃浦上靠住。　　一艘汽油船開始駛到離船塢不遠的寗海艦去了。　　這里，禮台旁的海軍的喇叭「啦拉」地一吹，軍官們結隊至橋上，依儀式行禮。　歌在一隊藍布制服的小學生口中唱得很響很整齊。　　塢內的工人也開始動起手來，把擱在塢旁的木頭一根根推到水里去，他們浮着木排，以掃帚作槳，在塢內做着工作。　　小汽油船把「進塢禮艦」寗海拖過來，衹見艦頭上立着一些整齊的穿着制服的軍官。近了一些，才看到艦頭上除了軍官和海軍外，還有七八位小姐，其中有一位立在正中的，披着白綢披肩，白綢旗袍，白皮鞋；手里捧着一束鮮花。不要人吿訴，大家都知道了是剪彩禮的馬明葉小姐。　　艦頭進了塢口，塢旁大小邊砲哩哩啦啦的爆發起來，軍樂聲中，二旁看着的人，給從天空落下來的碎邊砲紙打得一身，像是新郎新娘那樣的。　　艦頭快要接觸到彩球了，立在馬小姐旁邊的艦長伸出手去抓住了彩球，馬小姐白手套中的剪刀很快的把彩帶剪斷了，彩帶向二邊落下，彩球落到艦上。　　馬小姐棕色臉蛋上，露着絲絲笑容，讓幾隻攝影鏡頭從艦底下攝取她的笑容。　　寗海艦被二旁拖重機上的鐵索拖着，盪漾似的盪進，鐵索過處，二旁的人都給趕到後邊去了。工頭拿着話筒和　子「快點！慢點」地在指揮着工人。　　這樣一直駛到離橋的丈來餘的地方定下了，站在艦頭上的馬小姐艦長以及其他官員退下，橋上的軍官們也在軍號聲下退了下去。　　在辦公處吃了茶點之後，這海軍江南造船所第三船塢增長工程到這時完了。　　據該所發出的消息：說該所原有乾船塢兩，一為五百餘尺，一為四百餘，對於中型萬噸左右的軍艦商船，有鉅量的修造，第三號船塢增長工程後，長度為六百四十餘尺，闊一百尺，深二十六尺，以後，各國來華巨船過滬，均可從容入塢勘騐。　　回來，雨又像眼淚似的下着了。播音節目特別節目　　稚鳴社　　交通（一三〇〇）下午五時半至六時半　　丁香山　（劍虹）　　長記得　（沈瑛）　　舟中曲　（璐玲）　　夜深深　（瑛瑛）　　飄泊者　（柴瑟）　　夜花園裏　（徐微）　　浣衣曲　（斐君）　　蛾眉月　（劍虹）　　小東西　（沈瑛）　　怒吼歌詠團　　交通（一三〇〇）下午六時半至七時　　自强歌　（全體）　　偉大的手　（楚君）　　新鳳陽歌　（克競）　　活路歌　（包痕）　　漁光曲　（雪霞）　　防癆歌　（震球）　　義勇軍進行曲　（靜喻）　　老母親　（嚴莊）　　天倫歌　（吳影）　　自由神　（全體）彈詞　　何芸芳何琴芳雙珠鳳　　中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻　　開篇「馬融」　　家貧赤骨簡神童。映雪囊螢恒苦功。兄弟終鮮父母故。容身無地住破窰中。衣食難周不怨窮。忽聞門外人聲沸。相送傾城絕色容。家丁僕婦去匆匆。嚇得書生渾無主。嫦娥宜乎廣寒宮。常常作揖細細問。薄命家君是馬融。身藏　院名瑤草。針綫年年勤女工。欲獻奸權梁相府。立志命違端不從。豈與蕁常不孝同。有心　嫁寒酸子。累　多才簡相公。倘若不嫌貌醜陋。糟糠不厭亦高風。情願執炊為婢子。何妨伴讀五更終。不然溝壑埋身體。恐陷阿鼻十八重。餘生端不負相公。歌唱　　上海歌劇社　　華興（一二六〇）五時一刻至六時一刻　　淡白梅花　（周璇）　　慢牛快馬　（葉紅）　　回憶　（徐健）　　長期抵抗　（姚敏）　　滿目凄凉　（姚敏）　　勇十凱歌　（葉英）　　秋夜簫聲　（葉英）　　瑪麗若是你願意　（周璇）　　華興（一二六〇）下午七時至七時三刻　　鴛鴦怨　（周璇）　　小寳寳　（葉紅）　　春潮回來吧　（徐健）　　漁光曲　（葉英）　　蘇三不要哭　（葉英）　　新鳳陽歌　（徐健）　　別矣巴黎　（姚敏）　　知音之愛　（周璇）　　李樹德（九四〇）下午七時三刻至八時半　　寄來的吻　（周璇）　　鋤頭籌歌　（葉紅）　　雙搖舟　（徐健）　　蝶戀花　（葉英）　　寄給父親的詩　（葉紅）　　聲聲慢　（徐健）　　一封快信　（姚敏）　　春的煩惱　（周璇）　　大陸（六二〇）下午九時半至十時一刻　　夜花園裏　（周璇）　　孤星淚　（葉英）　　瀟湘夜夢　（徐健）　　民族魂　（姚敏）　　水東流　（葉紅）　　無冕的皇帝　（徐健）</p>

Chiang's letter of condolence stated briefly: "To the wounded generals and soldiers of the bandit suppression battle in Shanxi Province: Since the bandits Mao, Peng, Xu, and Liu led their remnants across the river to the east, the counties in western Shanxi have been the first to suffer, the people have been displaced, their homes have been reduced to ruins, and the flames have been rampant, threatening to spread. Fortunately, under the command and leadership of Director Yan, all of you generals and soldiers have fought bravely and vigorously, and the main force of the Red bandits has been defeated between Zhongyang and Shilou, with many captured and killed. The news of the victory is deeply gratifying. All of you wounded generals and soldiers have been fighting for weeks and have endured many hardships. Now that you have been wounded and sent to the rear for treatment, this chairman, due to official duties in Nanjing, cannot personally visit you, but I cherish your loyalty and courage and think of you with concern. I have specially sent Ning Shiyi, Major General Section Chief of the Military and Political Department, to carry items and travel to Taiyuan to convey my condolences. However, it is reported that there are still many remnant bandits who are gathering and lurking, trying to take the opportunity to break through and disturb the area. I have already increased the mobilization of a large army, divided and surrounded, to completely eliminate this group of remnant bandits and prevent them from spreading to the local area, causing endless hidden dangers. It is hoped that all of you wounded generals and soldiers will recuperate peacefully and recover your health as soon as possible, and continue to fight for the salvation of the country and the people with the spirit of fighting against the enemy in the past. As long as there is one breath left, this ambition must not be relaxed. This is what this chairman earnestly expects from all of you." (14th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Smuggling Rampant, Beining's Revenue Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The exact amount of smuggled goods entering Tianjin for consecutive days: On the 12th, 6,000 bags of sugar and 800 pieces of rayon; on the 13th, 2,200 bags of sugar are currently stopped at Tianjin Central Station, intending to be transported to Ji'nan in the original train cars. Currently, the ronin are planning a forceful protection method. At the Aokou, Yanghekou, Beidaihe, and Nandasi in East Hebei, smuggled goods are piled up like mountains. The warehouses built by smuggling groups will not be completed until two months later. The ronin plan to transport as much as possible before the specific anti-smuggling law in North China is implemented. Two trains can arrive every day. Because of the implementation of the new anti-smuggling law by the customs and railways on the Jinpu line, it is inconvenient for illicit goods to be transported south. Illicit merchants along the Jinpu line are asking smuggling groups in Tianjin to transport goods to the Pinghan line by force. Many illicit merchants pay deposits in advance, leading the ronin to increase their efforts to transport and sell goods for profit. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Smuggled goods such as silk and sugar are transported from Luandong by Beining trains, so the freight revenue of the line has increased sharply recently, averaging 180,000 yuan per day.

<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 14th and immediately went to the Executive Yuan to preside over the routine meeting on behalf of President Chiang. He met with reporters from the Central News Agency in the evening. According to him, there is no so-called old or new method to curb the problem of smuggling in North China. It depends on the ability of the anti-smuggling personnel to carry out the "anti-smuggling" work, which can be effective. Regarding the silver standard issue, Kong said that China's silver standard before the implementation of the legal tender policy was a free silver standard, and the current silver standard is a managed silver standard, because the exchange rate of each legal tender yuan has been set at one shilling and two and a half pence. As for the rumor that the Tianjin Mint is minting coins, it is indeed a rumor. The Tianjin Mayor Xiao Zhenying recently telegraphed to borrow the Tianjin Mint for machinery repairs. They mistakenly thought it was for minting coins, and the right to mint coins belongs to the central government. (14th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Issue of the Deadline for Exchanging Silver Coins for Legal Tender</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Since the implementation of legal tender, which has not been six months, the effect has been remarkable. However, the extension period for the use of silver coins will soon expire. After this, silver loans will lose their exchange value and become dead currency. What is worrying is that people value hard currency and are accustomed to observing from various aspects such as regional transportation, credit, knowledge, etc. It is not easy to complete the reform and transition in a short period of time. If the handling is slightly improper, it will only increase people's doubts and will inevitably lead to concealment. If the ban on concealment is strict and the rewards for reporting are generous, I am afraid that corrupt officials will take advantage of the opportunity and disturb the people. The drawbacks of opening silver mines in the late Ming Dynasty can serve as a warning. Therefore, the Legislative Yuan's deliberation on the regulations on punishing acts that hinder national currency does not include the concealment of silver. Legislative member Ma Yinchu said: "Occasional concealment of a small amount of silver by the people, if it is stipulated that they should be punished, is tantamount to opening a convenient door for the police and only disturbing the people. This is one reason. Using political power to force the people to hand over silver is enough to make the people hide silver. It is only necessary to stabilize the credit of legal tender, and the people will naturally be happy to exchange their silver for legal tender. This is the second reason." This is an essential argument that deeply understands the fundamentals of governance. If the government only makes the people aware that hiding silver is a mistake and unwise, the silver will be handed over without the need for criminal persuasion.</p>
<p>Although the silver that has been concentrated now has not yet been exhausted from the people, the credit concept of currency among the urban population is not as biased as before, and there is no mentality of hoarding hard currency. Even if there is a small amount of hoarding, it is still the intention of "storing grain to prevent famine." As for the interior, as a result of the continuous outflow of silver over the years, paper money is used almost entirely among the people. Moreover, since disasters have been frequent and rural areas have gone bankrupt, capital has moved to cities and is mostly concentrated in banks. Even those who are accustomed to hoarding and those who have hoarded over the years must not have large amounts. Therefore, it is not difficult to give a grace period to concentrate the silver. If the ban on use is difficult to be extended again, the exchange period should not be limited. When the people are forced to use it, they will certainly feel the futility of hoarding and think of exchanging it. If they are not allowed to exchange it, it will be a loss to the people and will it be beneficial to the country? Therefore, if the door for exchanging silver coins for legal tender can be kept open and not closed, private silver will certainly continue to come.</p>
<p>As for the exchange procedures in the future, they are also worth studying. Otherwise, it is easy to be misunderstood as "intending to collect for the purpose of circulation or intending to transport for profit." The criminal law is in place, and the concealment of currency will cause hesitation. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure its safety. Those who exchange legal tender at local legal tender exchange agencies must not be prohibited from exchanging it locally. If there is no way to exchange it locally, they must apply to the local public agency for a certificate or passport to go to the nearest place to exchange legal tender, or use it to pay public donations and taxes and deposits. In this way, silver will not escape, and people who hoard silver will have the convenience of exchanging it successively. The top and bottom will be linked, the people will not be disturbed, and things will gather themselves.</p>

<h3>Juancheng Yellow River Rises Sharply, Opening the Peach Blossom Flood's New Record</h3>
<p>The Yellow River in the territory of Juancheng, Shandong Province, rose sharply by one meter. The water level at Lisheng Village reached 58 meters, only 6 cm lower than the highest water level during the flood season. The biggest reason for the new record of the peach blossom flood is that the riverbed is gradually silting up and the estuary is silting up. This year's flood season is still extremely worrying. The Executive Yuan ordered the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to survey the estuary and prepare for dredging. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>

The proposal was passed at the Executive Yuan meeting on the morning of the 14th. The proposal includes the following measures: The national highway administrative authority should belong to the Ministry of Railways. The ministry should quickly draw and publish a general map of railways and highways. The national land transportation network should facilitate the mutual use of highways and railways, each maximizing its benefits, and the competent authorities should consider and handle this. To avoid competition between the two, all facilities should be properly planned by the Ministry of Railways. Uniform standards should be established for highways, bridges, and automobile construction. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Wireless Telegraph Test Achieves Excellent Results</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) For Sino-Japanese wireless telegraph communication, the Ministry of Communications has newly purchased two transmitting and receiving machines, one with a wavelength of 60 meters and one with a wavelength of 24 meters. They have now been installed and commissioned. Tests were conducted on the 9th, 11th, and 14th, with clear sound and good results. Formal communication is scheduled to begin on May 1st. The proposed rate for future telegrams is 8.5 jiao per word, compared to the previous rate of 1.45 yuan per word, representing a reduction of 5.7 jiao per word for formal communication. The Ministry of Communications has transferred 15 telegraph operators from Qingdao. Before implementation, two matters remain to be decided by the Ministry of Communications and the Japanese side: the issue of telegram rates and the issue of telegram rate division.

<h3>This Week's International Conference in Geneva: Focus on European Peace or War; Discussion of Italian Issue, Conflicting Opinions Between Britain and France; Attention on the Rhineland, Concern on the Nile; Collective Security Likely to Become a Dream</h3>
<p>Geneva The following agenda items relate to the discussion of European peace or war this week: On Tuesday, the Chairman of the Committee of Thirteen, Spanish representative Madariaga, will exchange conditions for a peace agreement on the East African issue with representatives of Italy and Abyssinia on behalf of the Committee. On Wednesday, the general staffs of Britain, France, and Belgium will meet in London to discuss joint land, air, and sea defense methods in the event of a German attack on the three countries. On Thursday, the Committee of Thirteen will hear Madariaga's report. Unless Italy can accept a fair peace proposal, the League of Nations will be required to impose new sanctions on Italy. This step will inevitably lead to two natural consequences: either a head-on conflict due to conflicting opinions between Britain and France, or Italy's inevitable revenge against Britain, deepening the war crisis in the Mediterranean. However, Britain will do its best to deal with both consequences, first because the British public is outraged by Italy's inhumane air bombings and the use of poison gas, and the government must take this into account; second, the British government can no longer ignore Mussolini's ambitions in East Africa and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Today, someone here made a very insightful criticism of the current stalemate, saying, "If France only focuses on the Rhine and Britain only cares about the Nile, then the so-called collective security will forever become a beautiful dream for mere talk." (National Telegram on the 13th)</p>
<h3>Pro-British or Pro-Italian: France Hesitates on the Wrong Path</h3>
<p>Premier Sarraut to Deliver Speech Explaining Position on the Italian-Abyssinian Case</p>
<p>(Paris) Whether France will adopt a pro-Italian policy or a pro-British policy when the Committee of Thirteen meets on Thursday is causing French politicians to rack their brains. Premier Sarraut met with Italian Ambassador to France Cerutti today. Afterwards, according to a spokesperson from official circles, France's attitude will not be determined before the British cabinet meeting on Tuesday. At the same time, Sarraut will also consult with Peng Gu. The Paris Afternoon News commented on the current situation as follows: "Today, the divergence of opinions between Britain and France will not only destroy British-French cooperation in Europe, but will also disintegrate the League of Nations." Former Premier Laval, who has remained silent since resigning, also spoke out today, advocating that France quickly reach an understanding with Germany. He believes that there is no benefit in simply refusing to negotiate. At the same time, Laval also advocated lifting sanctions against Italy to fully restore its participation in European affairs. Finally, Laval expressed indignation at Britain's tolerance of German rearmament. (National Telegram on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Premier Sarraut received Italian Ambassador Cerutti in the afternoon at 6:30 and did not finish the meeting until 8:00. The Premier immediately went to the Presidential Palace to meet with President Lebrun to report on the conversation. It is said that Cerutti asked the Premier what attitude the French government would take on the Italian-Abyssinian peace issue. Foreign Minister Flandin, who had gone to the countryside for the Easter holidays, recently notified Premier Sarraut that he would return to the capital on Wednesday (the 15th). The Premier has scheduled to deliver an important political speech on that day, broadcast by radio. At that time, all national radio stations will suspend broadcasting political speeches made by others. (Havas dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<h3>No Understanding Between Germany and France: European Peace Difficult to Achieve</h3>
<p>Laval Reiterates Former Policy: Advocates Restoring the Stresa Front</p>
<p>Clermont-Ferrand, France Former Premier and Foreign Minister Laval recently gave an interview to a reporter from a local newspaper, saying, "If there is no compromise between Germany and France, then European peace cannot be achieved." When I was Premier and Foreign Minister, I tried in many ways to bring Germany and France closer together. However, Germany repaid France's compromise attempts by abolishing the Locarno Treaty. France had previously requested Germany to join the Eastern European Pact. At that time, German Foreign Minister Neurath declared that even if other countries agreed on mutual assistance measures, Germany was also prepared to join the Eastern European Pact, provided that they were listed in individual documents. Who knew that after Russia and France concluded a mutual assistance pact, German Führer Hitler used this as an excuse to abolish the Locarno Treaty? I do not want to hinder the actions of the current French government. "Although I do not want to consider the details of the specific suggestions already put forward by Hitler, I believe that it is a mistake for France to stubbornly adhere to its prejudices and refuse to negotiate. Today, the unease in people's hearts and the chaos in the situation can be said to permeate the whole of Europe. Those in power should act quickly and decisively to resolve all outstanding issues between Germany and France as soon as possible." Laval then recalled his policy on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute when he was in office, saying that if Britain and France could understand each other, they could cooperate seamlessly. When I parted ways with British Foreign Secretary Sir Hoare in Paris at the end of last year (after drafting the Italian-Abyssinian peace plan), I declared that if our compromise policy was successful, the international situation would be clear. In the future, we can find ways to bring Germany into the ranks of collective security organizations. Unfortunately, peace in East Africa has not been restored, and peace in Europe is still awaiting creation. What are we doing now? On the one hand, we are invoking the Locarno Treaty and asking Italy to cooperate fully. On the other hand, we are fulfilling the League of Nations Covenant and continuing to impose sanctions on Italy. How can we allow this contradiction to persist? We should now restore the British-French-Italian front created by the Stresa Conference and lift the sanctions to allow the Italian-Abyssinian peace agreement to be concluded. Only then can we look at the fate of Europe with greater confidence, and the organization of the peace mechanism will also be somewhat promising." (Havas dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<h3>British Government Does Not Want to Intensify Sanctions Against Italy</h3>
<p>Eden Scheduled to Go to Geneva Today: Plans to Strive to Find a Solution</p>
<p>(London) According to people here, the British government does not intend to intensify sanctions against Italy at this time. Although the sub-committee of eighteen nations of the League of Nations General Assembly will be convened soon, its purpose is not to discuss intensifying sanctions, but only to review the implementation of the current sanctions. These people also said that Italian-Abyssinian peace negotiations will begin in Geneva in the near future, and the British government sincerely hopes that it will be successful. (Havas dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(London) Rumors say that because economic sanctions are insufficient to end the Italian-Abyssinian War, Britain intends to implement military sanctions. Other important member states of the League of Nations are also prepared to support Britain in taking this action. The public was alarmed by this news. However, according to well-informed sources, this rumor is completely unfounded. The British government's policy has not changed. The Paris community also does not believe it. According to the French Foreign Ministry, only the Committee of Eighteen Nations can decide whether the League of Nations should impose military sanctions on Italy. French political circles believe that British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Foreign Minister Flandin will never discuss military action. No such rumors have been heard in Geneva, and the claim that important member states of the League of Nations guarantee to support Britain in taking military action is not believed. Geneva now feels that any new sanctions that are more effective will cause very serious controversy. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden recently returned to the capital from the countryside this afternoon and is scheduled to go to Geneva in the afternoon tomorrow to attend the meeting of the Committee of Thirteen of the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations. He will also discuss everything with Prime Minister Baldwin at Sassoon's villa in Trent Park tonight. According to responsible sources, the main task of the British representative is to seek a solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. However, it is not allowed to express what position Britain should take if mediation fails. As for Germany, no contact will be made before the end of this week. British Ambassador to Germany Sir Phipps has not yet received any instructions. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Italy Sends Personnel to Geneva to Discuss Peace Issues</h3>
<p>Meeting of the Committee of Thirteen Postponed</p>
<p>Geneva Italian Prime Minister's confidential secretary Alocchi will discuss the peace issues between Italy and Abyssinia with Madariaga, Chairman of the Committee of Thirteen of the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations. A telegram from Rome said that he would arrive in Geneva no earlier than Wednesday afternoon. Well-informed sources believe that although the Committee of Thirteen is scheduled to hold a meeting on Thursday, it may be postponed to Friday for the convenience of Madariaga's talks with Alocchi. Madariaga will also meet with the Abyssinian representative, Abyssinian Minister to France Huater, beforehand. (Havas Agency dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The government has recently decided to appoint Alocchi as its representative to discuss the Italian-Abyssinian peace negotiations with the chairman of the Committee of Thirteen. Political figures here believe that the current dispute is not between Italy and the League of Nations, but between Britain and Italy. British Foreign Secretary Eden has recently been collecting materials on the Italian military's methods of warfare in order to accuse Italy and provide an excuse for intensifying sanctions. Although Italy will fully respect Britain's interests, it will do its best to protect all its own interests and resist any threats. (Havas dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Political figures recently said that Italy wants to directly and completely control Abyssinia, and no matter how Britain and the League of Nations resist, they will not be able to contain the power of the Fascist Party. Although military conflict between Britain and Italy is unlikely, if Britain attacks Italy with force, Italy will be able to deal with it easily. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Following Diplomatic Channels: Britain and Germany Continue Negotiations</h3>
<p>Eden's Visit to Berlin Unconfirmed</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden is currently in the countryside for the Easter holidays and is scheduled to return to the capital tomorrow. According to inquiries from this agency's reporters, the British government has now decided to continue negotiations with Germany through diplomatic channels. Foreign Secretary Eden himself will not go to Berlin to meet with Führer Hitler. Regarding these negotiations, the government will soon order British Ambassador to Germany Sir Phipps to raise questions with the German government regarding several points in the German memorandum. At that time, the British government will decide its attitude based on the German government's response. (Havas dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<h3>Britain to Propose Suggestions: Reconciling French and German Plans</h3>
<p>Peace in Central and Eastern Europe Urgently Needs to be Maintained. Conclusion of Non-Aggression Pact within the Scope of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>(London) As far as people know, the British government urgently wants to maintain peace in Eastern and Central Europe. It will soon make suggestions to Germany to reconcile the peace plans of France and Germany. Generally speaking, Britain advocates that the mutual non-aggression treaties proposed by Germany should be regularly included in the mutual assistance clauses, and that the obligations undertaken by each country that signs this treaty should take precedence over those stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant, and that the others should be determined so as to be compatible with the alliance and also harmonize with France's suggestions. Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov had previously raised an objection, saying that according to the method proposed by Germany, if Germany invaded another country, the countries that had signed a non-aggression treaty with Germany would not be able to fulfill the mutual assistance obligations contained in the League of Nations Covenant. If mutual assistance clauses are included in the non-aggression treaty, then the Soviet Union's objection cannot be established. (Havas dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-French-Belgian General Staff Talks Begin Today</h3>
<p>(London) The talks that the general staffs of Britain, France, and Belgium should conduct in accordance with the draft Locarno Treaty are scheduled to begin tomorrow (Tuesday). The Italian government has not yet ratified this agreement and will not send personnel to participate. The Belgian general staff is represented by Lieutenant General Terfonton and Major Waters (military attaché at the British embassy). (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to responsible sources here, the Locarno Treaty countries will hold military talks and have asked Italy to send a representative to participate. However, the Italian government has not yet decided whether to participate. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<h3>Rome Claims: Italian Troops Occupy Dessie</h3>
<p>News Not Confirmed: Aircraft Scatter Leaflets Over Addis Ababa</p>
<p>(Rome) According to news here, Dessie has been occupied by Italian motorized troops without any resistance. Mussolini, in order to eliminate Abyssinia's last resistance, has ordered the Italian troops on the northern route to hasten their advance towards Addis Ababa. According to Italian speculation, the fall of Addis Ababa will not be more than two or three weeks away. According to diplomatic circles in Addis Ababa, Mussolini may force the Emperor of Abyssinia to abdicate and support Duke Hara as a puppet. If the Emperor of Abyssinia resists further, the Italian army will occupy Addis Ababa. (National Telegram on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The claim that Italian troops have occupied Dessie has not been confirmed by official circles. However, according to reliable sources, Italian troops are currently working hard to attack, hoping to capture it by the Roman birth festival on April 21. If the Italian army occupies Dessie or Harar, General Graziani, commander-in-chief of the Italian army on the southern route, will begin his attack on Addis Ababa. General Badoglio, commander-in-chief of the Italian army in East Africa, congratulated war correspondents on Easter, telling them that they would soon have a lot of work to do. At the same time, the whereabouts of the King of Abyssinia remain a mystery. Some say that he has cut off his beard and fled to avoid being recognized and attacked by the tribal people, some say that he will abdicate sooner or later, and some say that Italy intends to use Duke Harar as a puppet king. However, none of these claims can be confirmed. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>Asmara Ten Italian bombers flew south from Magal, a city in northern Abyssinia, along the Dessie Road yesterday, and met with nine reconnaissance planes south of Dessie. They circled several times over Addis Ababa but did not drop bombs. They only dropped leaflets saying that the army led by the Emperor of Abyssinia had been destroyed and that the Italian army was here to abolish slavery and introduce modern civilization. Before leaving, the aircraft performed various aerobatic maneuvers in the air before safely returning to their base, a total flight time of seven hours. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>All-India Congress Opposes Imperialist War</h3>
<p>Sympathy for Abyssinia's Resistance to Italian Aggression</p>
<p>Lucknow The All-India Congress's plenary session today passed a resolution opposing India's participation in any imperialist war, expressing sympathy for Abyssinia's resistance to Italian aggression, and denouncing the policy of the League of Nations' powers in the Italian-Abyssinian War. As soon as the congress began today, several members of a certain Hindu faction rushed into the venue to resist the congress's interference in religious affairs. Chairman Nehru had to temporarily leave his seat until the demonstrators dispersed. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th)</p>

<h3>Foreign Minister Arita Decides on New Framework for Diplomacy Towards China: Focus on Economy, Politics and Military as Secondary: Japanese Foreign Ministry Convenes Senior Officials Meeting</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reliable sources, Foreign Minister Arita's diplomacy towards China will be actively negotiated in accordance with the following framework, with the aim of achieving it step by step:</p>
<p>Direct negotiations on the North China issue with the Hebei-Chahar Political Council.</p>
<p>Assisting and strengthening the Hebei-Chahar Political Council in cultural, political, and military aspects to establish a closer relationship with Japan.</p>
<p>Starting formal negotiations with the National Government to urgently seek to adjust Sino-Japanese economic relations, especially to request the National Government to reduce tariff rates, as the most urgent plan at present. As for political and military aspects, they can be temporarily placed in a non-essential position.</p>
<p>After the adjustment of economic relations is successful, further promote the Sino-Japanese-Manchurian Customs Union.</p>
<p>Regarding the existence of "Manchukuo," it is not necessary to force the National Government to recognize it, but at the very least, it must tacitly recognize "Manchukuo" and participate in the Sino-Japanese-Manchurian Customs Union or economic group.</p>
<p>Regarding the joint anti-communist issue, it is still necessary to establish a Sino-Japanese-Manchurian economic group as a prerequisite and not be too hasty. However, it is still necessary to urge the joint adoption of effective prevention measures against the red forces spreading eastward from Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang. (Hualian dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita convened his first senior officials meeting since taking office at 5 p.m. on the 14th in the Minister's office. The attendees included Vice Minister Horiuchi, Togo of the European and Asian Bureau, Kuwashima of the East Asian Bureau, and the heads of various departments. Important discussions were held on the specific strategies for implementing an independent and active diplomatic policy, and the meeting did not end until 7 p.m. The meeting conducted a comprehensive review of Japan's future diplomatic policy, and also decided on a draft for the Foreign Minister's speech on diplomatic policy to the special parliament. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to meet for two or three days to decide on the fundamental diplomatic policy. As for the situation of today's meeting, Vice Minister Horiuchi and the heads of various departments first explained in detail the various diplomatic issues from the past, and the most important points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The diplomatic policy towards Britain and the United States after the withdrawal from the London Naval Conference and being in an era without naval treaties.</p>
<p>The fundamental policy towards China and the Soviet Union for implementing the East Asian policy.</p>
<p>The recent series of border disputes between "Manchu-Soviet" and "Manchu-Mongolian" and the relations between the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and China.</p>
<p>The strategy for removing obstacles to the progress of Japanese trade. After reporting the progress since Foreign Minister Hirota, Foreign Minister Arita was asked to consider it, so the Foreign Minister will reveal the fundamental policies he holds on various issues at the next meeting in order to adjust Guangxi's diplomacy, so the general public is paying close attention to this.

<h3>Three Ports in North Korea to be Managed by South Manchuria Railway</h3>
<p>Transportation Between Japan and Manchuria Shortened: Extremely Important Strategically</p>
<p>(Dalian) Next month, Korea will transfer its three northern ports to the South Manchuria Railway, so that "Japan and Manchuria" will be closer. These three ports are mostly built with funds from the South Manchuria Railway, so that the shortest sea and land route between northern Manchuria and the Sea of Japan can be connected. Therefore, the relationship between these three ports in terms of economy and strategy is very important. This transfer is formed by a contract concluded between Korea and "Manchukuo," and "Manchukuo" will transfer the management rights to the South Manchuria Railway. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Matsuoka Yosuke Returns Home to Negotiate South Manchuria Railway Investment</h3>

<p>(Tokyo) Matsuoka Yosuke, President of the South Manchuria Railway, arrived in Moji at 6:30 this morning aboard the "Nekkha" (熱河) ship. According to him, considerable progress has been made on the unification of the Manchurian railway and the increase of the South Manchuria Railway's capital. The purpose of his return to Japan is to negotiate with various parties in Japan regarding investment in the development of Manchuria, Mongolia, and North China. He is expected to stay for two to three weeks before going to Dalian to resume his duties. (Hualan 電, 14th)</p>
<p>Soviet Armaments Sufficient to Resist Any Aggression; Vigorously Training Air Force Personnel</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Secretary-General of the Communist Youth League, Kossarev, said in a speech somewhere yesterday that if Soviet Russia were attacked, our planes and tanks, with the help of Japanese, Polish, and German workers, could destroy the enemy forces. Soviet youth are now preparing for war, but their preparation must be greatly accelerated. Last year, the Soviet Russian amateur aviation club trained 3,500 reserve pilots, and this year plans to continue training 8,000 people. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>Incident of Arrested Puppet Officials: A Commentary from a Moscow Newspaper</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The "Izvestia" newspaper commented on the Kwantung Army's report regarding the "discovery of a conspiracy by high-ranking Mongolian officials of Beian Province," stating that this will inevitably attract the profound attention of the world.</p>
<p>All newspapers in the world will inevitably ask: How could the governor of a province established by the Japanese, the chief of staff responsible for protecting the poor Manchurian Mongolian soldiers (these Mongolians love the Japanese and oppose the invasion of the Mongolian People's Republic), and even the head of the Secret Service, all lead a conspiracy to expel the Japanese liberators and merge with the Mongolian People's Republic?</p>
<p>The Kwantung Army is in a particularly difficult position here. However, misfortunes never come singly. We have not only discovered a lack of loyalty among the Manchurian Mongolians, but also a lack of intelligence and calmness in the Kwantung Army headquarters. The gentlemen of the Kwantung Army headquarters decided to attribute all evils to the Bolsheviks, and without thinking, decided to accuse the Soviet Union of being the seducer of the loyal Mongolians.</p>
<p>However, the problem arises: How did the Kwantung Army headquarters choose the highest officials of its most important border province? When an army is preparing for war but does not know how to manage the border, and suddenly discovers that the governor has been in contact with the Soviet Union since 1929, and has been communicating with the "enemy" and providing them with military information under the supervision of the Japanese police, this fact is extremely serious. I do not know what strange position the author of the report will place the Kwantung Army headquarters in.</p>
<p>Allow me to defend the Kwantung Army headquarters, namely, that the various rumors about the arrested leaders of Beian Province contacting the Soviet Union are just another repetition of old rumors. Viewing this ridiculous report from the Kwantung Army headquarters, which states that Soviet representatives participated in the activities of high-ranking officials of Beian Province, we dare to say that these officials, like the governors of other provinces in Manchuria, regard Japan as an invader and only express obedience under duress.</p>
<p>Not only the Kwantung Army headquarters, but also the Tokyo government knows the price paid for the loyalty of Manchurian officials and Manchurian troops, and the price paid for the support of various Mongolian princes. The Kwantung Army and Japanese imperialists are all aware that Manchuria is in turmoil everywhere, and that the "liberated" Manchurian and Mongolian people are storing up all sorts of monstrous things for them. Since Manchuria has such difficult problems, intelligent imperialists must come to the conclusion: do not move forward. However, the Kwantung Army does not see this point, and is not only preparing for new adventures, but is also using monstrous stories to make the relationship between it and the Soviet Union, which wants to live in peace with Japan, increasingly tense. If Japanese imperialism has such unwise officials in Manchuria, they will not be able to achieve any good results. (TASS, 14th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Extradites Japanese Soldiers' Bodies</h3>
<p>(Moscow) At the request of the Japanese Ambassador Ota, the commander of the Far Eastern Border Guards has been ordered to hand over three bodies of Japanese soldiers killed during a clash with Soviet border guards on April 9 when Japanese-Manchu troops invaded Grotekovo (i.e., the Suifenhe River area of the Soviet border) to Japanese officials.

<h3>The Spirit of National Unity in China is Sufficient to Resist Foreign Aggression</h3>
<p>Impressions Gained by an American Senator from a Conversation with Chen Guangfu</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator King, a Democrat, after meeting with Chen Guangfu, the head of the Chinese Bank inspection team, expressed his opinion today that Chinese nationalism will gradually increase and be sufficient to deal with future Japanese aggression. Although Westerners see China's position as hopeless, there are actually important ingredients that are sufficient for China to resist foreign insults. The most important is the gradual development of the concept of the nation. Now the remote provinces are gradually approaching the center. I have traveled in China before, and now I have the opportunity to meet with Mr. Chen, and I am convinced that China, under the leadership of General Chiang Kai-shek, the head of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, will see an increasing spirit of unity. As for the international silver issue, the only important event that may occur in the future is probably that the South American countries will unite with China and the United States to form a bimetallic standard group to promote the use of more silver. Recently, China's sale of silver to the United States to purchase cash indicates that China is ready to cooperate with the United States. (Guomin 電, 13th)</p>
<h3>Continued Economic Talks Between China and the United States</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau officially announced today that the negotiations between the Chinese Bank inspection team and the Secretary of the Treasury may continue for another two weeks. However, until a definite result is obtained from the talks, all circumstances will not be disclosed. As for the rumors circulating in Mumbai, saying that China has agreed not to sell silver below the world price, the authorities of the Treasury Department have denied it today. (Guomin 電, 13th)</p>
<h3>Shi Zhaoji on the Far Eastern Situation</h3>
<p>(Washington) Chinese Ambassador to the United States Shi Zhaoji said in a speech at the National Convention of American Women Writers today that there is no security in the world unless the rule of international law can be restored in Asia. Since the European War, all peace treaties have been almost completely destroyed, which is a major reason for the current instability of the world. Therefore, he suggested convening a world conference to restore peace and order, and said that the political situation in the Far East has become more unstable and more difficult to satisfy than in 1922 since a country that signed various treaties violated its actions.

<h3>Pan-American Peace Conference</h3>
<p>To Be Convened in Washington Today; Representatives from Twenty-One Countries to Attend</p>
<p>(Washington) Representatives from twenty-one countries in North and South America will meet here on Tuesday to discuss preliminary plans for a Western Hemisphere peace conference. The Dominican Republic has proposed the establishment of a League of American Nations, which has been seconded by Uruguay and will be submitted to the conference for discussion. (Guomin She 電, 13th)</p>
<h3>US Government Plan</h3>
<p>(Washington) The government will submit a plan to the Preparatory Committee of the Pan-American Peace Conference for review. The main points are no more than the following four items:</p>
<p>The countries of the Americas implement a tariff truce.</p>
<p>Any country in the Americas that has an act of aggression will be subject to economic sanctions by other countries.</p>
<p>Establish a permanent security system to protect American peace.</p>
<p>All related countries act in unison to maintain neutrality in the European war. Regarding the first item, Secretary of State Hull attaches the most importance to it, wanting to set a period of five years during which the related countries must not raise tariff rates. Regarding the second item, American public opinion has always been extremely opposed to the economic sanctions decided by the League of Nations. The government is not unaware of this, but believes that the economic sanctions decided by the League of Nations are European sanctions, which are very different from the cooperation of American countries to deal with those who disturb the peace of the Americas. State Department officials also declared that the above four items are only suggestions and can be used as the basis for discussion. Once all related countries unanimously agree, they should be submitted to the Pan-American Peace Conference. (Havas 電, 13th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Campaign Speech: Continuing to Strive to Restore Prosperity</h3>
<p>Still Advancing Towards the Economic Goals of the New Deal; Six Ways to Reduce Domestic Unemployment</p>
<p>Baltimore President Roosevelt delivered a broadcast speech from the Maryland Young Democrats tonight, informing the whole country that this was his first decisive statement to begin his re-election campaign, declaring that he would continue to strive for social progress. He would reconsider shorter work weeks and adequate minimum wages, and the reduction of the number of unemployed people each year. President Roosevelt said that social work has only just begun. Although production increased and profits were higher in 1928 and 1929, the number of unemployed people increased rapidly to an alarming extent. Therefore, merely wanting to restore what ordinary people call a state of prosperity is of no use. Now, while restoring prosperity, we must also reduce unemployment. There are six ways to do this:</p>
<p>Expand purchasing power and distribute it more widely.</p>
<p>Raise the age at which children leave school.</p>
<p>Have older workers retire and give them pensions.</p>
<p>Shorten weekly working hours.</p>
<p>Distribute employment evenly throughout the year.</p>
<p>Provide an adequate minimum wage. President Roosevelt's remarks indicate that even though he has suffered setbacks, he still wants to pursue policies similar to the National Recovery Act. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Celebration of Republican Anniversary: Firecrackers Mistaken for Bombs</h3>
<p>Government Figures Experience a False Alarm; Drunkard Responsible Has Been Arrested</p>
<p>Madrid Today is the fifth anniversary of the establishment of the republican system. The government held a military parade to celebrate. President Barrio and members of the cabinet all attended the parade. Several explosions occurred at their seats, causing great panic throughout the audience. The presidential guard and the troops participating in the parade团 thought that someone was trying to sabotage, and immediately surrounded each of the seats. The audience, panicked, fled to the nearby streets. At that time, an officer was seen pulling out his pistol, and it was mistaken for a thug trying to deal with him privately. After an explanation, it was stopped. Later, it was found that the explosions were caused by firecrackers. The security team then held an inspection, and the explosions occurred again, and there were pistol sounds. A soldier was shot twice in the leg. At that time, a young man was pointed out as the shooter and was arrested by the police. Later, it was found to be incorrect. The audience thought it was the provocation of the Fascist Party people in Italy, and was deeply uneasy. (Havas 電, 14th)</p>
<p>Madrid During the military parade held today, there was an incident of opening a pistol. A total of three people were injured on the spot.

<h3>External Consolidation: Staff of Overseas Embassies and Consulates</h3>
<p>A Special Qualification Review Committee is Established with Chen Jie as the Chairman; Emphasizing Virtue, Learning, Writing, Appearance, and Physical Fitness; Recruiting Real Talent</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to carefully select staff for overseas embassies and consulates and to consolidate the diplomatic ranks, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has established a Qualification Review Committee for Staff of Overseas Embassies and Consulates. On the 14th, it announced that Chen Jie would be the Chairman, and Tan Shaohua, Lin Chunxian, Wu Songgao, Liu Shishun, Gao Zongwu, and Li Dijun would be the committee members. In the future, personnel assigned to overseas posts, in addition to being handled in accordance with the Law on the Appointment of Civil Servants, their qualifications should first be strictly reviewed by the committee in accordance with regulations. According to a certain authority in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, since Minister Zhang took office, he has spared no effort in adjusting the Ministry's structure and personnel. The performance evaluation within the Ministry has been completed, and the personnel of various overseas missions will also be actively consolidated. Because the staff of overseas embassies and consulates are representatives of the country, they bear a heavy responsibility. In addition to possessing the qualifications that ordinary civil servants should have, special attention must be paid to the following five words: "Virtue," "Learning," "Writing," "Appearance," and "Physical Fitness." Virtue should be pure, learning should be refined, writing should be proficient, appearance should be dignified, and physical fitness should be strong. If one has the legal qualifications of an ordinary civil servant and also possesses these five qualities, then going to other countries will enhance the glory of the country and gain the good reputation of foreigners. Now our country pays attention to the rule of law and strives to guarantee rights. But since we want to talk about guarantees, we must first carefully select officials for appointment. Since the qualifications required for embassy and consular personnel are different from those of ordinary civil servants, when appointing embassy and consular personnel, in addition to the standards stipulated in the Law on the Appointment of Civil Servants, one must also consider these factors as the goal and be especially careful. Moreover, since the opinion of a single senior official in the Ministry may not be comprehensive, the method of a committee has been specially adopted in order to pool ideas and benefit from each other. Although the Ministry had previously promulgated the "Provisional Regulations for the Qualification Review Committee for Diplomatic and Consular Officials," it has not yet been established. In order to implement it thoroughly, the existing regulations have been revised and formulated as the Provisional Regulations for the Qualification Review Committee for Staff of Overseas Embassies and Consulates of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which was promulgated on the 10th. The Permanent Vice Minister serves as one of the committee members, and six senior officials of the Ministry serve as committee members. The qualifications of all personnel in overseas embassies and consulates, other than ambassadors and ministers, regardless of the transfer of existing personnel or the dispatch of newly appointed personnel, must first be carefully reviewed by the committee. The criteria for review, in addition to being handled in accordance with the provisions of general laws and regulations, will also take into account the above-mentioned five words: "Virtue," "Learning," "Writing," "Appearance," and "Physical Fitness," so as to prevent redundancy, recruit good talents, and promote the fame of outstanding individuals at home and abroad. In addition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an order saying that employing people based on talent has been a clear lesson since ancient times. In the way of selecting talent, qualifications come first. The staff of overseas embassies and consulates represent the country, promote friendly relations, and protect overseas Chinese affairs. With regard to the selection of personnel, how should we carefully select them to be appropriate? However, the law has been lax for many years, and the appointment has been redundant. In order to prevent opportunism and recruit real talents, the Ministry has specially established a Qualification Review Committee for Staff of Overseas Embassies and Consulates to specialize in review. In the future, personnel assigned to overseas posts by the Ministry, in addition to complying with the Law on the Appointment of Civil Servants, their qualifications should first be strictly examined in accordance with the newly formulated regulations. Virtue and learning must be excellent, language skills must be refined, appearance and physical fitness must be emphasized, and compatibility between people and places is especially important. In this way, outstanding individuals can be promoted and used in all directions, without deviating from the fundamental purpose of the country in employing people. There is high hope for this. This order. (Central News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has established a Qualification Review Committee for Staff of Overseas Embassies and Consulates. After the Provisional Regulations are promulgated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Minister Zhang will appoint Chen Jie as the Chairman of the Qualification Review Committee for Staff of Overseas Embassies and Consulates, and Tan Shaohua, Lin Chunxian, Wu Songgao, Liu Shishun, Gao Zongwu, and Li Dijun as committee members. Qian Yi, the head of the Records Section of the General Affairs Department, also serves as the secretary. It was officially established on the 14th. From that day on, the list of existing consuls-general, consuls, vice-consuls, and staff members of overseas missions will be collected and reviewed by the Records Section. If there are those who are not suitable for the place or whose virtue and learning are not very rich, they will be transferred separately. In the future, all Ministry orders announcing embassy and consular personnel must first be reviewed and approved by the committee before they can take office. The first meeting will be held within days, and eight regulations will be announced. (Special Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>Dr. He Lian Publishes: Insight into Financial Problems</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Economic expert He Lian recently came to Nanjing after completing his inspection in Sichuan. The reporter, because Mr. He is not only a famous economist in our country, but has also conducted on-the-spot inspections of the economy of various provinces, specially visited him to ask for his opinion on the financial problems in the extraordinary period when economic circles are hotly debating. He answered in great detail. Mr. He advocated that we should take advantage of the enthusiastic psychology of the people across the country in preparing for financial problems in the extraordinary period to seek the soundness of our country's tax system, thereby establishing a solid foundation for finance in the extraordinary period. Mr. He believes that a sound tax system is indeed the only way for our country to achieve self-reliance, and it is also a more reliable way to enrich financial revenue in the extraordinary period. Because most of our country's current taxes are indirect taxes, they will change during the extraordinary period. If direct taxes are gradually implemented, they can not only meet the financial needs of the extraordinary period, but also conform to the spirit of modern tax systems. Mr. He also advocated that among direct taxes, income tax and inheritance tax should be implemented first. Someone said that our country's socio-economic situation is still in the state of the Middle Ages, and it is not suitable to implement modern tax systems. He replied that our country cannot stick to the old ways and not cater to the spirit of modern tax systems. Others said that the revenue from direct taxes in the future, during the extraordinary period, may not be sufficient to offset the shortfall in indirect taxes. He replied that if the implementation of direct taxes falls into an extraordinary state at the beginning, of course there will be no tax revenue. If it has a considerable history, even if we only talk about income tax, it will definitely not be limited to the revenue of 5 million yuan set in the national budget for the 24th year. Finally, Mr. He hoped that the government should pay attention to three things when implementing direct taxes: The legislation must be simple. Initially, it can be handled concurrently by other financial institutions. It should be promoted in stages. (Central News Agency, 14th)</p>

It may mean occasionally touching land.

<h3>The Seventeen Kings of Kawa Advocate Using the Salween River as the Yunnan-Burma Border; Issue an Open Letter to Compatriots Calling for Unified Advocacy; And Write to Neutral Commissioner Ehlers</h3>
<p>Kunming Correspondence: The Yunnan Provincial Guomindang Steering Committee received a letter yesterday from the Kawa Seventeen Kings Tribal People's Council, requesting assistance in the Yunnan-Burma border survey, advocating the use of the southern section of the Salween River as the natural boundary, and attaching the Kawa Seventeen Kings' Open Letter to Compatriots and a letter to neutral commissioner Mr. Ehlers. The committee copied the attached documents and submitted them to the Provincial Government for review and handling. This matter concerns the border region peoples' self-determination regarding border demarcation. The Open Letter to Compatriots and the letter to Mr. Ehlers are recorded below:</p>
<p>Open Letter to Compatriots</p>
<p>We, the Kawa Seventeen Kings region, border Shuangjiang and Lancang to the east, Mengliang to the south, the lower reaches of the Salween River to the west, and Keqian and Mengding to the north. Since ancient times, our ancestors have been enfeoffed by the Chinese Emperor to guard the frontier for thousands of years. This is not only recorded in history books, but also evidenced by seals issued by successive dynasties. Although we, the Kawa people, are from the uncivilized frontier of Yunnan and have not received the benefits of Chinese culture and education, our languages and scripts are different, yet our men diligently cultivate the land, and our women focus on weaving, working day and night to support ourselves, which is largely the same as the Han people. Due to the dangers of the high mountains and the isolation caused by miasma and rain, travel is fraught with fear, leading to distance and separation from our motherland. This is the general situation of the division between the uncivilized and the civilized. Since the loss of Burma, and our motherland has faced many difficulties over the years, British imperialists have taken advantage of their management of Burma to advance into the north and south Yi mountains, and even send troops across the river. They have dispatched over a thousand soldiers, equipped with modern weapons, ostensibly to explore and investigate mines, blinding and deafening our motherland, and confounding the world's sense of justice. They have secretly occupied our Banghong, Honglufang, and other mining areas to satisfy their ambitious aggression, disregarding the League of Nations treaties, and using all means to oppress us, wanting to obtain our Kawa land and enslave our Kawa people to achieve their goals. Alas, we Kawa people are simple and unsophisticated, without any prior planning, how can we defend against the comprehensive plan of a civilized world power for decades? How can bows, arrows, and matchlocks defend against modern weapons? Helpless, we can only wait for our demise, losing our land and being exterminated, which is imminent. Alas, we are responsible for protecting the land passed down by our ancestors, but we will lose it, and our descendants will not inherit it from us. We cannot face our ancestors in the afterlife, and what can we say to future generations? We kings should have planned long ago, sacrificing sleep and food, gathering together to discuss and swear oaths. Although Kawa is small and its people weak, it has thousands of square miles of land and hundreds of thousands of people. Relying on the natural barriers and our inherent bravery, we vow to cut off our heads rather than lose our duty to defend our land, and shed our blood rather than become colonial slaves. Even if we have only one gun and one bullet, one woman and one child, we will break our bodies but never change our hearts. From now on, we will rely on the spirit of self-determination and self-defense, and the resolve to die to live, not fearing the invasion of powerful enemies' ambitions. Our Kawa land is the extreme western frontier of China's national defense, and is the western and southern part of China. Its gain or loss is important and relates to the security of the motherland, especially Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guizhou provinces. How can we not be in danger? Moreover, the Kawa region is rich in gold and silver, renowned throughout the world. British imperialists have long coveted it, taking advantage of our motherland's troubled times to boldly send troops and establish camps, intending to occupy it permanently. At this time of border survey, if we do not forcefully argue and reclaim our land, it would be no different than handing over our treasures to the enemy, and handing over the entire Kawa nation to imperialists as a tool to suppress other small and weak nations. Our motherland's government is forced to endure and concede. We Kawa people, although foolish, are determined not to willingly submit and allow ourselves to be driven and divided as slaves of British colonialism, giving up this precious and useful territory. Furthermore, the Kawa region borders the Salween River to the west. Since ancient times, our ancestors have lived here, relying on the river as a natural boundary. The customs and habits of the people are not much different from those of China. We kings believe that this border survey should be based on the boundaries familiar to the local people as recorded in the former Yunnan-Burma treaty, and also the envoy's note should be based on the terrain relevant to the issue, which is the fundamental way to resolve disputes in the border survey. What is more familiar to the local people than our Kawa kings' ancestral homeland seals, and the determination to use the river as the boundary? Considering that our government officials may be weak and follow precedents, willing to satiate the imperialists' greed with our Kawa land and people, we dare to convene the Kawa Tribal People's Self-Determination Representative Assembly in Gansai, and publicly elect representatives to collect seals and evidence, and plead with the border surveyors to state the Kawa people's pain and vow not to be slaves or beasts of burden, requesting our border survey team to forcefully argue based on this. Although it is uncertain whether we can fully achieve our goal, we Kawa people recall the early oaths and the gradual announcement of the self-determination and unity policy to heaven and earth. We vow to cut off our heads rather than be colonial slaves. Therefore, we respectfully inform our government, provincial officials, legal groups, and compatriots, as well as neighboring county magistrates and government offices, overseas compatriots, elders, brothers, sisters, asking you to have compassion on the suffering and helplessness of our small border nation, to remember the fear of lip loss and teeth chill, and the danger of scraping rice to see the kernel, and to provide practical assistance directly or indirectly, or to write requests to widely inform our national compatriots, so that the Kawa people can achieve self-determination, self-defense, and the preservation of our national territory, and not suffer the fate of being subjugated like the Burmese. Then the border people will be fortunate, and the national defense will also be fortunate. Respectfully, the Kawa Seventeen Kings.</p>
<p>Letter to Mr. Ehlers</p>
<p>Mr. Ehlers, Chairman of the Sino-British Border Survey Committee, we respectfully express our most sincere trust and heartfelt wishes to you. You, entrusted by the League of Nations to resolve the border disputes in the southern section of the Yunnan-Burma border, have come from afar. Your position is the position of the League of Nations, and your glory is the glory of the League of Nations. We are deeply gratified to see your arrival, like seeing light in a dark room. Previously, China lost Burma, but the British were not satisfied and wanted to obtain our Wa land. We believe that Wa land is China's border area, and the Wa people are a part of the Chinese nation. We also have seals issued by the Han Emperor as evidence. Our customs and habits are largely the same. We are all part of the same body and do not want to be divided. We also have a duty to defend our land, so how can we give up? Therefore, we have always been united, preventing the British from advancing even one step on the border line. This is why the Yunnan-Burma border issue has been unresolved for so long. Now, you are presiding over public deliberation, resolving doubts and analyzing disputes. May your wisdom shine brightly and without concealment.</p>
<p>We respectfully request that you, based on our inherent territory, with the spirit of fearlessness and the means to quickly resolve disputes, resolutely advocate that this section should use the Salween River as the natural boundary, then the disputes can be resolved, the people's hearts can be satisfied, the tragedy of bloodshed can be avoided, and your noble benevolence can shine with the sun and moon. In recent times, the self-determination of the Saar people has been praised throughout the ages. Although the Wa land is small, we admire justice. We believe that Great Britain, with its vast territory and wealth, has already gained much and should not abandon the friendship between the two countries for this small area, nor mobilize troops to oppress our helpless and weak nation, which would be ridiculed by the world. If not, entering our borders, invading our territory, enslaving our people, and forcefully seizing our territory, then we Wa people, although foolish, will also exhaust our knowledge and ability to carry out legitimate defense. We may break our bodies, but we will never change our hearts. Even if we have only one gun and one bullet, one woman and one child, we will fight to the end and never willingly submit and be slaughtered, bringing indelible shame to the Chinese nation. Now, at the time of the Sino-British border survey, we have gathered in Gansai and decided to hire Mr. Yin Peiyun, a resident of Gansai in Wa land, as our plenipotentiary representative to lead us to attend. We believe that you, with your foresight, will be able to understand the key to this problem. We dare to inform you of our humble intentions, hoping that you will consider them and forward them to the General Assembly of the League of Nations in Geneva. (Central News Agency)</p>

<p>*   All public security sub-bureaus that have not been approved for retention will be abolished. From now on, public security matters in each district will be handled by the district offices.</p>
<p>*   The abolished public security bureaus and posts should immediately prepare a detailed list of documents, equipment, firearms, and income items, and submit it to the county government for verification and transfer to the district office. The seals should be returned and cancelled.</p>

<p>*   The original income of the abolished public security bureaus and posts that is deemed to be exploitative should be reduced or exempted to reduce the burden on the people.</p>
<p>*   The number of police officers to be established in the district office should be approved by the county government based on local needs and reported to the Civil Affairs Department for record.</p>
<p>*   If the number of police officers in the district office is [unclear] or more, a chief should be established. If the number exceeds ten, the number of chiefs may be appropriately increased.</p>
<p>*   If the number of [unclear] in the district office is ten or more, a patrol officer should be established to assist the district chief in handling public security matters.</p>

If it is not the location of the district office but the location of a township office, the original income will be allocated to the township office. Township offices may also establish police officers as appropriate.</p>
<p>*   The establishment of police officers in township offices should be handled in accordance with Articles 8 to 10 of these measures.</p>
<p>*   District and township offices handling public security matters should comply with existing laws and regulations.</p>

<h3>Taxpaying Chinese Association – Representative Assembly This Afternoon – Election of Chinese Directors and Executive Committee Members – Chairman Wang Xiaolai Returned to Shanghai Yesterday to Preside</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports: The Shanghai Concession Taxpaying Chinese Association will hold its 15th First Representative Assembly at 2 PM this afternoon on the fifth floor of the Association’s premises at 59 Hong Kong Road, to elect Chinese directors to the Shanghai Municipal Council and executive committee members, and to discuss other important matters. Chinese directors and Chinese committee members of the Municipal Council will attend to report. The Association's Chairman, Wang Xiaolai, also returned to Shanghai last night to preside over today's meeting, and is scheduled to hold the first meeting of the Executive Committee at 3 PM on the 16th to elect a chairman and vice-chairman, three standing committee members, and to discuss the cases submitted by the first Representative Assembly of this session. The Chairman's speech and the Director's report are recorded below:</p>
<p>Chairman’s Speech</p>
<p>Speech by Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the 15th First Representative Assembly of the Shanghai Concession Taxpaying Chinese Association: Representatives of the Shanghai Special City Party Department of the Chinese Nationalist Party, Representatives of the Shanghai Office of the Executive Yuan of the National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Government, Ladies and Gentlemen, Today marks the establishment of the ninth Representative Assembly of the Taxpaying Chinese of the Public Concession, and it is also the day when this Representative Assembly holds its first meeting. In this autumn of internal troubles and external threats, which is even more pressing, the mission of this Representative Assembly, although entrusted only by the million residents of the First Special District of Shanghai, has a relationship, in form and in reality, that extends to the entire country, and even to the world. Therefore, the responsibility of this Representative Assembly is even more difficult than that of previous sessions. This is something that all representatives cannot deny or abandon. It is noted that the first meeting of the first Representative Assembly (April 1928) was chaired by Mr. Yu Qiaqing. His concluding remarks stated, "In short, if taxpaying Chinese wish to obtain real benefits, the legislative power is of utmost importance. However, if administrative and executive affairs are not presided over by Chinese, there will eventually be a situation where the tail wags the dog." Also, at the first meeting of the seventh Representative Assembly (April 1934), the chairman's speech legally recognized the status of this First Special District, characterizing the district's autonomous organs as "autonomous organs jointly managed by Chinese and foreign residents. If this can be evolved, and given a short period of transition, it is the most peaceful and straightforward method for unifying and completing the Shanghai Municipality." Although the impact of the above two points cannot be explained one by one, the enthusiastic participation of individual and group members of this Association is sufficient to indicate that their understanding of the future is real and accurate. The competition for rights should go hand-in-hand with the competition for obligations; otherwise, the competition becomes selfish. Our Chinese nation's love of peace, harmony, and propriety are indeed supreme virtues, but there should be limits, that is, to ask ourselves if our obligations are not inferior to others. Statutory rights should be strived for; otherwise, there will be problems in survival. Therefore, our people's enthusiasm for competing in the election of foreign taxpayers this time is considered unprecedented in the history of the Shanghai Municipal Council. However, we can regard it as an excellent lesson. What is regrettable is that after the ballots were counted, 323 unselected ballots were found in the empty ballot box, and they were added after the list of elected candidates was announced. This seems to be a misunderstanding. In 1931, during the major Yangtze River flood and the September 18th Incident, this Association sent a letter to the Municipal Council, in the form of a memorandum, requesting that they observe the economic situation and implement austerity policies. Although the Municipal Council did not deny it, it was not effectively implemented. During the first meeting of the previous Representative Assembly, the economic depression in this First Special District was almost indescribable. Therefore, the chairman's speech stated, "Judging from the current financial methods of the Municipal Council's income and the decline of the market, it will definitely be insufficient to meet expenditures next year." Fortunately, Mr. Ford, the Director of Finance of the Municipal Council, was adept at coping, and there were no major flaws. However, regarding the most important eight-year education plan that has been set to improve the educational level of citizens, it has not been implemented. After several consultations, only one Municipal Council primary school was established this year, and the education subsidy was increased by 19,000 yuan. This shows their straitened circumstances, which cannot be concealed. Judging from the Municipal Council's budget for 1936, although their act of cutting expenditures cannot be considered "preventing a fire before it starts," it is still commendable to "mend the fold after the sheep are lost." However, the "duplication of agencies" and organizations that provide entertainment for a very small number of people can still be seen in the budget, and it is difficult to understand what the intention is. In the speech by the chairman of the previous Representative Assembly, it was stated, "Individual expenditures must be based on income, but those who handle municipal affairs often despise the general economy of society, always expanding the budget year by year to show gradual prosperity, and some even consider it to be respectable." He also quoted the warning from former British Prime Minister MacDonald at the Lausanne Conference, "Public prosperity depends on individual prosperity," to urge the Municipal Council to pay attention to finance. At the same time, in order to help the Municipal Council open up new sources of revenue and reduce expenditures in finance, he proposed the implementation of cases such as collecting general vacant property taxes without violating the law. Unfortunately, the Municipal Council specializes in the method of "killing the goose to get the golden eggs," that is, not implementing the ratio of ten to one for property tax and land tax, but instead increasing the estimated amount of existing actual rent to increase the tax, and further invalidating the ratio of twenty to one stipulated in the Land Regulations. As a result, the total revenue from both property tax and land tax has actually decreased. This Representative Assembly should take this opportunity to urge the Municipal Council to pay attention. In terms of personnel, local talents should be selected as much as possible so that salary items can be saved. For equipment, construction, printing, and other materials, those with low prices and equivalent effects should be selected as much as possible to show people the fact of waste. Accumulating small amounts makes a large amount. The tax burden on taxpayers is lightened, and the Municipal Council's budget is also easy to balance. Why not do it? The population of this First Special District, with us as the masters, accounts for more than 95%, and the taxes paid, even based on the memorandum issued by the Municipal Council in 1927, not to mention that the actual number is more than this, is more than 55%. Therefore, the allocation of seats on the Municipal Council board, even if it does not follow the population ratio, should at least follow the tax ratio. Our Chinese directors on the Municipal Council should have at least ten seats. Regarding the issue of increasing the number of our Chinese directors on the Municipal Council board, there was a clear suggestion in the exchange of letters between this Association and the Municipal Council on March 26, 1928. Based on the words and spirit of the exchange of letters, this Association proposed increasing four seats on February 12, 1934. Unexpectedly, the authorities of the Municipal Council at that time forgot their own position and arbitrarily expressed their rejection beyond their authority. In their reply letter, they said, "Out of consideration for the public opinion of foreign residents, the foreign directors believe that increasing the number of Chinese directors is not yet the right time, and even if the proposal is put forward, it will not be supported by the representatives of the countries concerned." The chairman's speech at the previous Representative Assembly stated that these words have the following fallacies:</p>
<p>1. Dividing the entire Municipal Council into two parts, namely, the foreign directors and the Chinese directors. This is detrimental to the dignity of the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>2. Foreign directors unilaterally decide the rights of Chinese residents, completely stifling the opinions of Chinese directors.</p>
<p>3. Arbitrarily determining the opinions of the representatives of the countries concerned.</p>
<p>4. Still regarding A taxpayers as able to restrict or open up the rights of B taxpayers. Our people understand that increasing the number of Municipal Council directors means increasing responsibility. The manifestation of this responsibility is the taxpaying obligation. After having fulfilled obligations beyond rights for many years, putting forward this legitimate request is in line with the so-called "normal course of events" in the above-mentioned exchange of letters from the Municipal Council. This Representative Assembly should, based on legal principles and public opinion, express and implement genuine cooperation between Chinese and foreign residents, and resolve to "petition the government and authorize the Municipal Council to negotiate with the representatives of the countries concerned to increase the number of Chinese directors on the Municipal Council by four seats, starting from 1937, to show the sincerity of genuine cooperation." Those who understand the prosperity of this First Special District through cooperation should not hinder it, but should support it. The market in this First Special District is still in a slump. We should be of one mind and work together to make every effort to seek its revitalization. We also hope and urge the Municipal Council to follow the methods of the Shanghai Municipal Government in providing relief to the unemployed and safeguarding the poor, and to build public housing and run orphanages, etc., so that everyone can be properly cared for. Then the threat to security can be reduced day by day, and the defense funds used to suppress this threat can be transferred to "education" and "care." The work reports of the directors and committee members of this Association who attended the Municipal Council in the previous session can be found in the booklet. Please refer to it. We respectfully thank the Party and government representatives for their presence and supervision.</p>
<p>Director and Committee Report</p>
<p>Report on Participation in Government by the Directors and Committee Members of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council for the Year 1935. We were entrusted by the previous Representative Assembly to serve as directors of the Municipal Council and committee members of various committees for the year 1935. One year has passed, and our term has expired. Today, we are pleased to attend the first meeting of the Representative Assembly for the year 1936. We respectfully report on the important matters related to our Chinese people that we have participated in during our term:</p>
<p>1. Allocation of Duties in the Administrative Committee: The powers and responsibilities of the various administrative committees of the Municipal Council, and their position in the administrative system of the Municipal Council, have been explained in detail in the previous report, and will not be repeated here. Although the number of committees has increased or decreased over the years, they have generally remained the same. There are currently twelve committees, not including those that are temporarily formed due to special circumstances. There are about 30 Chinese members, which is several times the number when Chinese first joined. Chinese people participate in all important matters. The Chinese School Subsidy Committee is composed entirely of Chinese people. The Library and Water Rate Review Committee are both chaired by Chinese people. The committee set up last year to review the telephone rate increase also hired Chinese experts. The Land Committee has increased two Chinese members, which is especially important for the amendment of the Yangjingbang Regulations. It has been formally approved by our government last year, and all legal procedures have been completed. According to the years of Chinese participation in government affairs, although the number of directors and committee members has increased, Chinese and foreign taxpayers are still not in an equal position, which is truly regrettable. Last year, we exchanged views with Chairman Arnold several times, and drafted methods as a basis for discussion. However, due to the importance of this matter, it is difficult to achieve success without careful and thorough consideration. We still hope that the representatives will uphold the inalienable rights of citizens and the equality of Chinese and foreign status, and urge the new directors and committee members to continue their efforts to achieve full success. We sincerely hope so. The list of our committee members on each major committee is as follows: Finance Committee: 8 seats, 3 Chinese seats, held by Xu Xinliu, Wang Yansong, and Xi Yushu; Police Committee: 9 seats, 3 Chinese seats, held by Yu Qiaqing, Jiang Yiping, and Xi Yushu; General Affairs Committee: 8 seats, 3 Chinese seats, held by Guo Shun, Wang Yansong, and Zhu Wenqi; Staff Committee: 8 seats, 3 Chinese seats, held by Yuan Ludeng, Guo Shun, and Xi Yushu; Public Utilities Committee: 8 seats, 3 Chinese seats, held by Feng Bingnan, Jiang Yiping, and Yu Hualong; Health Committee: 9 seats, 3 Chinese seats, held by Chen Jicheng, Yu Hualong, and Xu Xiaochu; Transportation Committee: 12 seats, 4 Chinese seats, held by Yu Qiaqing, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, and Zhu Wenqi; Education Committee: 9 seats, 4 Chinese seats, held by Lin Kanghou, Liu Zhanen, Ou Yuanhuai, and Xi Yushu; Library Committee: 5 seats, 2 Chinese seats, held by Xu Xinliu and Chen Jicheng.</p>
<p>2. Retention or Abolition of the Music Band: The proposal to improve the music band in order to reduce municipal spending has been made for a long time. Last year, the proposal to abolish the band or transfer it to a private institution was simultaneously submitted to the Chinese and Western taxpayers' meetings, and the results were either yes or no, and no consensus was reached. The Bureau then formed a music subcommittee to consider this issue in detail. The subcommittee recommended that the existing music band be disbanded and a new band be formed, based on the principle of economic efficiency. The annual cost should not exceed 200,000 yuan. The members of the new band should sign separate employment contracts and should not enjoy the benefits enjoyed by other Municipal Council employees. The organization is tentatively set to have a director, a deputy director, and a brass band instructor, each with one person, and 44 members. After repeated assessments by the board of directors, they did not want to make a decision immediately, and planned to seek the opinions of taxpayers before proceeding with the review. If taxpayers believe that the music band should still be retained, then the reorganization should be approved according to the subcommittee's recommendations, in order to save costs. If the annual expenditure does not exceed 200,000 yuan, then the savings should be 80,000 yuan, which would be a small supplement to the municipal treasury. The concert will still be held as usual this year. Students from the National Central Conservatory of Music will participate in the performance from time to time, which is a rare event and has won great praise.</p>
<p>3. Improvement of the Transportation System: This city is densely populated and vehicles block the roads. In recent years, the Bureau has repeatedly improved the transportation system. The previous report described it in detail. When the Chief of the Police Department was on leave, he was instructed to consult extensively at any time to see whether it would be more beneficial to hire an expert to handle transportation matters, or to use existing personnel to specialize in it. The Chief of Police Department then appointed a Deputy Inspector on leave to go to the traffic department of the Scottish police district to practice managing pedestrians and vehicles, in order to adopt it and observe its effectiveness. Other important matters related to transportation include:</p>
<p>(1) Improving the Transportation Regulations and Restricting Parking: Any vehicle parked in a busy city is only allowed to park within a limited time and must not be delayed arbitrarily. On the roads between Xiaoshadu Road and the Bund, parking is not allowed for more than half an hour from 8 AM to 6 PM, and violators will be punished. This new regulation was decided in April last year and will be implemented after a nine-month postponement, followed by a two-month notice.</p>
<p>(2) Issuing Licenses to Drive Small Rental Cars: This was approved by the Transportation Committee, but when the Board of Directors reviewed it, they thought that the service of small cars might not be as good as that of larger models, and that their structure was not strong enough, which could easily lead to accidents. They also felt that they would make traffic more crowded, so they rejected it.</p>
<p>(3) Amending New Regulations to Ban Random Honking: No car shall have more than two horns, and any horn that makes a loud noise shall be prohibited. Only sharp, short sounds are allowed. In addition, except for special circumstances, no vehicle is allowed to use the horn when it is stopped. This new regulation came into effect on October 3. At first, many drivers were punished for violating the regulations, but as the ban gradually became known, everyone complied. The noisy sounds in the city on a daily basis, which disturbed people's minds, were reduced a lot, and it has been effective.</p>
<p>4. The General Situation of Chinese-Foreign Relations: Chinese and foreigners live together in the concession, and they share prosperity. Therefore, all municipal facilities must be based on harmonizing ethnic sentiments and promoting local prosperity. In recent years, there have been debatable aspects of Chinese-foreign cooperation, but there are also some that can be permitted. In the summer of 1934, the National Government promulgated regulations prohibiting the private storage and smuggling of goods. Last year, the Bureau and the Customs authorities agreed on methods to assist in searching shops in the concession for contraband. If such a case occurs, the Legal Department will file a public prosecution with the First Special District Court for legal punishment. In addition, various agencies in our country have sent trainees to the Bureau for internships. This year, many people from Nanjing and Hangzhou were sent to various administrative offices for training, with special emphasis on firefighting, finger-printing research, and firearms identification. The responsible personnel gave separate guidance and detailed explanations, which were highly valued by various authorities in our country. In addition, Chinese-foreign county-related cases, such as cross-border road construction and factory inspections, have not been resolved due to the complexity of the relationship, which is an obstacle to cooperation and should be addressed as soon as possible in order to eliminate them.</p>
<p>(Handling of the Telephone Issue: Last year, the Shanghai Telephone Company applied for a price increase because its operating income was insufficient to pay interest. When citizens heard about this, they strongly opposed it. The Chinese and Western Taxpayers' Annual Meetings simultaneously passed resolutions authorizing the Municipal Council to form a special committee to explore the entire case. The Bureau followed the wishes of the taxpayers and proceeded to organize the special committee. Initially, it was planned to have four committee members, one each from China, Britain, Japan, and the United States, and to hire one telephone expert to assist. Later, Japan requested that a Japanese expert be added, but our country believed that this case was closely related to the interests of the Chinese people. Without the participation of Chinese experts in the research, the interests of the Chinese people would inevitably be ignored. Therefore, the Board of Directors decided to change the committee to an expert committee, composed of one expert each from China, Japan, Britain, and the United States. The Chinese expert was borrowed from Mr. Hu Ruixiang, Director of the Nine Provinces Long-Distance Telephone Engineering Office of the Ministry of Communications. The number of charges was scheduled to be implemented in January this year, and it was recognized that there was still an urgent need to reduce the company's operating expenses. In November, the experts' report was submitted to the Board of Directors for review. We proposed that the implementation period be postponed by two months. If the company's operating income exceeds the amount of interest, the price should be reduced immediately, and various expenses should be reduced in accordance with the experts' recommendations to reduce the burden on users. After discussion, it was agreed that the current price would be used as a trial period for one year. All surplus reserves, which should be half owned by the company, were cancelled with its consent, also for a period of one year. The length of each call should not be restricted. Various installation fees should be reduced according to the prices set by the experts. As for the company's calculation of profits and losses, such as the payment of income tax to the US government and the management fees of the International Telegraph and Telephone Company, there is room for negotiation. The income tax item is not within the scope of the contract and should not be borne by users. The management fees paid to the international company (calculated at 4.5% of the total income per year, about 300,000 yuan) should not be borne by Shanghai for a long time. As for depreciation, the Bureau borrowed money at the end of the year before last to help the company change its debt from gold to silver. Therefore, the amount of investment should be reduced by 3 million yuan, and the amount of annual depreciation can also be greatly reduced. These three items should be further discussed and properly handled by the Bureau and the company, in order to maintain the interests of users and to live up to the deep trust of taxpayers.</p>
<p>(Investigation of Household Registration in the Concession: The investigation of household registration in the concession is scheduled to be held once every five years. Last October, it was held as usual. The calculation is based on the total number of people who spent the night in the survey area on the night of October 23. The survey forms are explained in Chinese, English, Japanese, and Russian. The Bureau also asked the Municipal Government and the French Concession Board of Directors to work together to ensure the accurate number of households in Shanghai, the age of each household, and the population density in each district. The Bureau investigates the foreign household registration in the cross-border road construction area, and the Municipal Government provides the number of Chinese households. The Chinese aspect of this survey is more advanced than the previous one in four aspects:</p>
<p>1. In the past, Chinese household registration was only divided into adults and children. This time, it is divided by age.</p>
<p>2. In the past, servants were listed separately for each household. This time, they are included in the occupation item.</p>
<p>3. A separate item is listed to indicate how many homes there are in each household.</p>
<p>4. A detailed breakdown of the number of people in each occupation of Chinese citizens is provided. The results of the survey have been published. There are 51 nationalities. The number of Chinese citizens is 1,120,860 (excluding the cross-border road construction area). The number of foreign citizens is 38,915. The total number of Chinese and foreigners is 1,159,775. If calculated as a percentage, Chinese citizens account for more than 96%, and foreign citizens account for less than 4%. The difference in numbers is so great. Compared with the previous survey, the number of Chinese citizens has increased by 149,463, and the number of foreign citizens has only increased by 1,618.</p>
<p>(Current Situation of Drug Prohibition in the Concession: Since the National Government adopted a six-year plan to strictly ban opium, the drug situation in the concession has been of concern to us. Last year, the Bureau drafted a drug prohibition report and submitted it to the League of Nations. According to the investigation by the Police Department, drug use is still a serious problem in this city. It is deeply hidden and difficult to eradicate. Although it seems that there has been a decrease in the number of opium smokers, the number of users of morphine and heroin is increasing day by day, and there is a rapid rise to replace opium. Therefore, the amount of raw and cooked opium seized is decreasing day by day, while the amount of heroin seized is increasing sharply. The registration of opium addicts is still being carried out slowly in the concession, and the exact number is unknown. In the year before last, 7,996 opium offenders were arrested, and 6,655 were convicted, which is a considerable number. The Bureau is making every effort to crack down on the manufacture and sale of drugs at any time. The difficulty is that there are often large-scale international drug traffickers who forge names, fraudulently obtain passports, and sneak into Shanghai to buy and sell drugs for sale to other countries. The number of manufacturers of morphine and heroin is also increasing day by day. Therefore, it is difficult to cope with. Crude morphine is often smuggled from the Sichuan-Yunnan area to Shanghai, which is also one of the reasons for the sharp increase in the number of private drug manufacturers.</p>
<p>(Progress of Chinese Education: The educational policy of the Municipal Council has been divided into two major outlines since the Education Committee redefined it in 1931:</p>
<p>1. Establishing Municipal Schools</p>
<p>2. Subsidizing Private Schools</p>
<p>In recent years, educational administration has been carried out in accordance with these two outlines. Last year, the Japanese Residents' Association suggested stopping the establishment of new schools and transferring all construction funds to subsidies. The Bureau's Education Committee expressed its opinion that this move is contrary to the current education policy. The current policy is to build new schools and subsidize private schools, and the two should be carried out in parallel and complement each other. It is not advisable to be biased. It is not advisable to concentrate educational construction funds on subsidizing private schools, which would be a great waste of effort. This was approved by the Board of Directors, and the original educational policy was maintained. As for the educational facilities for Chinese people last year, in terms of building new schools, the Education Committee initially recommended continuing the eight-year school construction plan, adding one primary school and one girls' middle school. However, the Board of Directors felt that the local economy was declining, tax revenues were short, and the municipal treasury was exhausted, so they decided to first build one primary school, accommodating more than 500 people, using the existing school buildings of the Xinvxue on Penglu Hanbili Road. Another night school will be established in the eastern district, specializing in the reception of female workers, teaching simple knowledge. Both schools have opened one after another. There are now four Municipal Chinese schools, with 2,341 students, one girls' middle school, with 840 students, six primary schools, with 4,000 students, and one night school, with 800 students. Except for Chinese middle schools, all schools are headed by Chinese principals and teachers. Chinese middle schools have also been approved by the Ministry of Education, and students can participate in the joint examination. Those who pass can be admitted to national universities. The curriculum has also been revised and implemented in accordance with the standards set by the Ministry for many years. Each school now has a Chinese vice-principal, and the Bureau plans to find ways to transfer Western teachers and gradually reduce them. As for subsidizing private schools, it has been expanded year by year since it was implemented in 1932. The initial subsidy was 110,000 yuan, which has been increasing year by year. It is now nearly 130,000 yuan. There are 36 middle schools and 187 primary schools that receive subsidies, with a total of 46,111 students. The Bureau has formed a private school subsidy committee to be responsible for the distribution of funds. The Health Department sends staff to inspect each school from time to time, and those whose sanitary facilities do not meet the regulations can be suspended from payment. As for teaching, its quality is still supervised and guided by the Education Bureau of the Municipal Government, to show that the educational power belongs to it and cannot be transferred. Some of the above points may be known to you, and some may not be known to you, but what is important is that they are the important policies implemented in the concession in the past year, which can be asserted. We are not good enough, but we were entrusted by the previous Representative Assembly to take on the difficult task of dealing with Chinese-foreign relations and being responsible for local administration. We are often short of talent and ability. It is difficult to live up to the ardent expectations and strict supervision of the citizens, and we feel guilty. However, our love for the country is the same as that of the wise, and our desire to protect our rights has never been behind others. We have made every effort to protect the welfare of the people and the sovereignty of the country, and we have done our best. This is enough to reassure you. As for other administrative affairs in the concession, the annual report for 1935 is sent to each taxpayer by this Association every week and will be completed soon. It discusses them in more detail. It will be sent to the secretariat of this Association within days and can be read at any time. What is not covered in this report is detailed in it. Directors Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Guo Shun, Jiang Yiping, and Xi Yushu; Committee Members Wang Yansong, Lin Kanghou, Yu Hualong, Chen Jicheng, Zhu Wenqi, and Xu Xiaochu.</p>
<h3>Verdict on Bribery Case of Patrol Officer</h3>
<p>Ge Yunpeng, a patrol officer of the Second Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau of Houqiao Town, arrested gamblers at the home of a villager, Pu Fucheng. Pu Fucheng bribed him with ten yuan, which was split and used by police officers Wang Qinglin, Qi Mingxuan, Chen Xiang, Yang Yaochao, and Chen Jinrong. After police officer Chen Ziming reported this to Patrol Inspector Chen Shaohua, Ge Yunpeng and others were transferred to the court for trial. Yesterday was the scheduled date for sentencing. Judge Liu presided over the court, sentencing Ge Yunpeng to three years and six months in prison, and Qi Mingxuan to six months, suspended for three years. After the sentencing, they were taken back into custody. Wang Qinglin and the other four were released on bail and therefore were not sentenced.</p>
<h3>Completion of Road Paving on Changzhou-Lishui Road</h3>
<p>After the opening of the Su (Jiangsu) - Li (Shui) Road (from Wujin to Lishui), traffic was initially allowed on the earthen road, and business was quite good. However, since the road surface had not yet been paved, vehicles had to stop during rainy weather, causing considerable inconvenience to travelers. The authorities dispatched special personnel and allocated funds to implement the paving of the road surface in sections, which has now been gradually completed. From now on, the road should be unobstructed, allowing cars to run on schedule. Shen Zhe from the Jiangsu Provincial Highway Administration Department departed from the province today to inspect the road construction along the route and provide instructions.</p>
<h3>Planning to Establish a Women's Reformatory</h3>
<p>Xu Baoguang, the Director of the Wuyi Public Security Bureau, believes that punishing and releasing prostitutes who are arrested does not fundamentally solve the problem, as they gradually return to their old habits. He has specifically suggested to the county government that a women's reformatory be established, so that prostitutes can be housed and educated to fundamentally eliminate prostitution. The county government raised this issue for discussion at the tenth day political affairs meeting, deciding that the Public Security Bureau and the Relief Institute should jointly consult and formulate concrete measures, and then submit them for review and establishment.</p>
<h3>On Financial Policies During Extraordinary Times</h3>
<p>— Xiao Shuyu</p>
<p>Today, Dr. Yin Chu gave a speech at the Nanjing Zhongshan Society on "Financial Policies During Extraordinary Times." According to his analysis, the main sources of revenue for our country are customs duties, salt taxes, and consolidated taxes. When extraordinary times arrive, these taxes will become unreliable. First, because the seaports will be blockaded, foreign trade will come to a standstill, so there will naturally be no customs duties. Second, because the main salt fields are located in the southeastern coastal areas, they will inevitably be occupied. Once the salt fields are lost, there will be no salt tax to collect. The consolidated tax relies on Shanghai, Tianjin, and other major commercial ports. At that time, these places will be destroyed or occupied, so the consolidated tax will also be unreliable. Since the above tax revenues have no hope, and at the same time, public bonds cannot be issued because there is no collateral, lacking funds, the only thing left is to inflate the currency. However, issuing too much currency will make restoration difficult in the future. Finally, he proposed two methods as countermeasures:</p>
<p>Implement the collection of income tax,</p>
<p>Limit the inflation of currency.</p>
<p>The above is a summary of Dr. Ma’s speech. (Mr. Jian Shishi has a record of his speech.) I find his analysis and conclusions very valuable for research, but I cannot completely agree with them. Therefore, at that time, I simply expressed my different opinions. Here, I also quote his records for research.</p>
<p>Regarding Dr. Ma's analysis, I believe it is indeed worth considering, but it is inevitably too negative and pessimistic. Let us try to estimate it from both the revenue and expenditure aspects of the country.</p>
<p>From the revenue side, the total budget for the 24th year is 957,154,006 yuan, of which 341,361,400 yuan is from customs duties (accounting for more than 35%), 184,219,044 yuan from salt tax (accounting for more than 19%), and 113,298,177 yuan from consolidated tax (accounting for slightly less than 12%). These three items account for the absolute majority of the country's net income. If Dr. Ma's predictions come true, the country's finances will be in dire straits. But the reality is not that simple. Even in terms of customs duties, although the enemy may be able to blockade our southeastern coast, they may not cut off traffic to Guangzhou and Hong Kong. If not, our foreign trade during extraordinary times will not be completely nonexistent. As for salt taxes, although the main coastal salt fields may be occupied, we can stockpile large quantities in advance. Moreover, the land and well salt from Sichuan can also supply the consumption of several provinces. If our country's preparations are well managed, and salt is publicly sold, the revenue should not be less than the current salt tax. Finally, when it comes to the consolidated tax, it is even more complex and flexible. If the government and the people are unprepared in advance, and the so-called southwestern and northwestern construction plans are just empty words, then naturally there will be no consolidated tax to collect. Otherwise, if the government can lead and assist the people in implementing the "economic policies for extraordinary times" briefly listed below, then the domestic nascent industries will prosper because the seaports are blockaded and fewer foreign goods flow in. In this way, the consolidated tax will not necessarily be without hope. According to my analysis above, our country's main tax revenues during extraordinary times will only be partially reduced, and will not be as severe as Dr. Ma described.</p>
<p>It is not enough to determine financial policy solely from the amount of revenue. Therefore, we also need to analyze and study the expenditure side. According to the general budget statement for the 24th year, the expenditure is 957,154,006 yuan. Although the highest amount is for military expenses (328,000,000 yuan), we assume that this expenditure will increase during extraordinary times. However, the expenditure next to military expenses is debt service, totaling 175,803,279 yuan, of which 145,222,190 yuan is for domestic debt principal and interest, 44,556,057 yuan for foreign debt principal and interest, 33,908,706 yuan for the Boxer Indemnity, and 40,442,852 yuan for loans. This expenditure can of course be completely suspended during extraordinary times. The next largest expenditure is subsidies (101,980,089 yuan) and financial expenses (66,011,343 yuan), education and cultural expenses (37,211,621 yuan). The expenditure on finance and education can of course be reduced at that time. The main item in most of the subsidies is the total amount to be planned by each province under the national defense construction item in the future. In addition, although the expenses for national affairs and party affairs are not very large, they can also be reduced by more than half. As for the expenditure figures at that time, no one can assume them at this moment, it depends on the requirements of the environment and reality. But it is undoubtedly necessary to expand the budget more than usual.</p>
<p>After briefly discussing our country's current general budget, I will move on to the main topic. Dr. Ma regards the collection of income tax as the main countermeasure in financial policy during extraordinary times. I am very skeptical of this proposition. Of course, I am sympathetic to the implementation of income tax collection, but according to the Ministry of Finance's estimates, the annual income is only more than five million (listed as five million in the general budget). But excluding the more than four million yuan currently collected from public servants for income tax donations, there is only slightly more than one million benefit. Moreover, once extraordinary times arrive, public servants can only receive the minimum maintenance expenses, so where will there be income tax to collect? Other employees such as teachers, doctors, lawyers, factory workers, shopkeepers, and bankers will inevitably have their income reduced due to the impact of current affairs, and income tax will naturally be reduced. Therefore, using income tax to enrich the country's finances during extraordinary times is akin to drawing a cake to satisfy hunger. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Jiangnan Shipyard's Largest Dock Opens Yesterday</h3>
<p>Ms. Ma Mingqu cuts the ribbon; the Ninghai warship enters the dock for the first time.</p>
<p>The No. 3 dock built by the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy was completed at the end of last month. The opening ceremony was held yesterday afternoon at 3:30 p.m. Chen Jiliang, Vice Minister of the Navy, presided over the ceremony, and Ms. Ma Mingye, daughter of Ma Deji, Director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, cut the ribbon. The ceremony was solemn and enthusiastic. The ceremony was held at 3:30 p.m., and attendees included Chen Jiliang, Vice Minister of the Navy, Ma Deji, Director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, Lin Yuanquan, Director of the Ordnance Department of the Navy, Huang Xianqi, Staff Officer, Wu Zhennan, Director of the Coastal Defense Office, Fang Ying, Director of the Pilot Training Institute, Liu Depu, Director of the Survey Bureau, Cai Baoqi, Battalion Commander of the Navy Guard Battalion, Cao Yijing, Director of the Aircraft Manufacturing Department, Chen Pengfan, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Jiangnan Shipyard, and section chiefs Yu Jianfu, Liang Xunying, Ye Zaifu, Guo Xizhi, Yan Shouhua, Captain of the Yongji warship, Gao Yishen, Captain of the Ninghai warship, engineer Sheng Qunhe, soldiers from various warships, students from the Jiangnan Shipyard's workers' children's school, and about a thousand guests.</p>
<p>A glimpse of the venue: The dock is the largest in the country and can accommodate 20,000-ton ships. It was designed by the American World Industries Corporation and constructed by the Xinheng Construction Company. The engineer was Sheng Qunhe. The ceremonial platform was set up in the north of the dock, with a portrait of Sun Yat-sen hanging in the center, and the Party and national flags hanging above it. The surroundings of the venue were decorated with various colored ship flags. The entrance to the dock was covered with colorful ribbons. The Navy Guard Battalion was stationed along the way to maintain order. The Ninghai warship was designated by the Navy to perform the dock entry ceremony.</p>
<p>Ceremony Held: After the ceremony was performed according to protocol, Chen Jiliang, Vice Minister of the Navy and Commander of the First Fleet, reported on the construction process of the dock. Then music was played, and the Ninghai warship slowly entered the new dock amidst the melodious music. Ms. Ma Mingqu, holding鲜花, accompanied by Captain Gao Xianchen, stood in front of the ship. When the Ninghai warship approached the ribbon, Ms. Ma waved the scissors and cut the ribbon. A burst of firecrackers erupted, and the ceremony was completed. Then, the staff of the shipyard entertained the guests, showed them around the various departments of the factory, and served tea and snacks until about 4 o'clock.</p>
<p>Construction Process: The Jiangnan Shipyard originally had two docks, one over 500 feet long and the other over 400 feet long. It has historically undertaken a large amount of construction and repair of medium-sized warships and merchant ships of around 10,000 tons. From the 21st to the 24th year of the Republic, Chen Shaokuan, Minister of the Navy, concurrently served as the director of the shipyard. Considering that there were no large-scale facilities in the country's shipyards, and that there was often insufficient supply during the annual dock inspection of naval vessels and various merchant ships, which was detrimental to the maintenance of the shipping industry, he began to build the third dock in May of the 22nd year. The first phase was completed by October 10th of the following year. Its scale was already one of the largest in our country. Chen continued to promote and expand it, ordering Ma Deji, the director of the shipyard, to continue to work hard, and painstakingly raising funds to support it amidst difficult financial circumstances. His determination to construct it was unparalleled. Therefore, on April 1st of the 24th year, construction was started again, extending the dock by several hundred feet. Today, it has been completely completed, with a total length of over 640 feet, a width of 100 feet, and a depth of 20 feet. Both sides are built with steel sheet piles and filled with cement. The gate is rectangular, and the pumping room is built next to it. The solidity of the engineering and the novelty of the layout can be called great. From now on, when large ships from various countries come to Shanghai, they can enter the dock with ease and conduct inspections, which will greatly benefit the future of the shipping industry.</p>

<h3>Ding Shaoji Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Will Go to Nanjing to Report Today or Tomorrow</p>
<p>Ding Shaoji, a counselor at the Chinese Embassy in Japan, was transferred back to China. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. from Japan aboard the Japanese ship Shanghai Maru, accompanied by his son and others. Zhou Jue, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Director Zhao Tiezhang, and Zhang Mengling, among others, all welcomed him at the Huishan Wharf. After disembarking, Ding rested at the New Asia Hotel. He is scheduled to go to Nanjing tonight or tomorrow morning to pay respects to Foreign Minister Zhang and Interior Minister Jiang and report. According to Ding, who spoke to a Central News Agency reporter on board, he was transferred back to China because he had private matters to attend to in Shanghai, so he planned to stay in Shanghai for a day or two before going to Nanjing to report, and because he had been away from his hometown for a long time, he would take the opportunity to return to his ancestral home in Hubei before going to Nanjing to take up the position of expert member of the Treaty Committee of the Ministry. As for Sino-Japanese diplomatic issues, he has now left his position and is not in a position to express any opinions. According to what he personally knows, after the political changes in Japan, there will be no changes in Japan's foreign policy toward China or toward Europe and the United States. Although the situation between Japan and Russia is frequently tense, it is unlikely to lead to war, because although Japan is urgently preparing for war domestically, it does not advocate war. The candidates for ambassador to China include Shigemitsu Kawa and others, but no decision has been made yet. Ding continued to say that Japan's industry and commerce have developed greatly in recent years, and the social economy has naturally been affected by the global economic downturn, but the impact on overseas Chinese in Japan is still slight.</p>

<h3>Conflict with Police Detectives Yesterday; Many Trams and Buses Damaged; Shops Temporarily Closed; Both Sides Injured; Mediation by Chinese Directors Expected to Prevent Escalation</h3>
<p>Dagon News Agency reports that the Public Concession's Labour Committee of the Municipal Council previously restricted the number of rickshaw pullers registered and reduced rickshaw fares, which was opposed by the rickshaw owners, leading to a strike on the first of this month. After mutual consultation, a solution was reached to reduce rickshaw fares, but the registration of rickshaw pullers would continue, scheduled to begin yesterday, but only allowing 5,000 people. The rickshaw owners stated that there should be no restrictions on registration. Yesterday morning, as many as 20,000 rickshaw pullers went to register, demanding that the registration office increase the quota. Due to the large number of people and the complexity of the situation, disturbances occurred. The police went to suppress them, resulting in minor injuries to several people. This matter has been mediated by the Chinese directors of the Municipal Council, and the situation may not escalate.</p>
<p>Quota of 5,000, 20,000 Arrive: The Labour Committee of the Municipal Council scheduled the registration of rickshaw pullers to take place at the sampan factory in the west of Shanghai, at Ma Gen Road, east of the new bridge, on the 14th of this month, but only allowed 5,000 people. The rickshaw owners believed that there were no fewer than 60,000 to 70,000 rickshaws in Shanghai, and even if 40,000 people registered, there would still be many who did not register. If there were such restrictions, they would be unemployed, so they immediately expressed their opposition, demanding that unrestricted registration continue. Yesterday, the Municipal Council held the registration at the rickshaw puller registration office in Shun De Lane on Ma Gen Road. According to the registration procedures, the rickshaw puller should first obtain an application form from the registration office with the owner's road permit for the fourth month, and then the rickshaw puller should be recommended and registered at the registration office. The recommendation method is that each rickshaw or every two rickshaws recommend one person, and three rickshaws recommend two people. There are 10,000 rickshaws in Shanghai, so 5,000 rickshaw pullers can be recommended. However, when registering yesterday morning, more than 20,000 people went directly to the registration office on Ma Gen Road to demand registration, resulting in considerable disorder.</p>
<p>Many People and Noise Cause Disturbances: The registration office of the Labour Committee was originally scheduled to start registration at 8:00 a.m., but given the large number of rickshaw pullers who arrived and the chaotic order, it was impossible to start. At that time, a few rickshaw pullers were still loudly calling for an increase in registration. Because there were too many rickshaw pullers, the area from the eastern end of Ma Gen Road registration office to the sampan factory on Carter Road was the concentration area of rickshaw pullers, and traffic was almost blocked. At this time, several hooligans from outside suddenly loudly demanded an increase in registration, and a small number of rickshaw pullers echoed them, and then disturbances occurred.</p>
<p>Vehicles Damaged and Traffic Cut Off: At this time, the Public Concession's No. 10 bus passed through the area of Carter Road and Ma Gen Road, and the No. 19 trolleybus also passed through Carter Road and Ma Gen Road. They were stopped and attacked. The bodies were hit with small stones, causing much damage to the glass windows, totaling nine vehicles. However, the passengers in the car were not injured. However, pedestrians on the road were frightened and fled. Later buses and trolleybuses and other vehicles were afraid of being involved, so they dared not go. The Public Concession immediately dispatched a large number of police officers from the New Zha and Gordon Road police stations to prevent the situation from escalating and to prevent bad people from mixing in. They temporarily ordered the vehicles to cut off traffic. At the intersection of the Chinese concession at the New Sampan factory and the new bridge, only people from the concession were allowed to cross the bridge to Zhabei, and people from Zhabei were not allowed to cross the bridge to the concession. The police station agreed with the Public Security Bureau's New Zha Branch and the city's security team to send police officers and security teams to guard the bridge to maintain order. The disturbances among the rickshaw pullers occurred at 9 o'clock.</p>
<p>Police Suppression, Minor Injuries on Both Sides: At ten minutes, the police immediately sent Chinese and foreign police detectives to suppress them. At that time, there was a slight disturbance, because there was a conflict between the rickshaw pullers and the police, resulting in about ten rickshaw pullers being injured by wooden sticks and sent to the hospital. (According to the police, only one person was injured by being pushed down, and one person was detained by the police.) On the Western police side, Officer No. 1853 had his right eye injured and his pistol was also knocked off. He has now been sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Because the injury is not serious, there is no major problem. There was also Western detective Crowe and Western Deputy Head Moffatt who were slightly injured, and Chinese Deputy Head Tao Shiwei was also injured by stones.</p>
<p>Shops Closed and Registration Temporarily Suspended: After such disturbances lasted for half an hour, they stopped. The Municipal Council dispatched a large number of police officers, distributed from Carter Road and New Zha Road to the northern end of the Sampan Factory, the new bridge, and the area of Gordon Road and Ma Gen Road, to prevent accidents, and closed the iron gate of the new bridge, leaving only a one-meter wide sidewalk for pedestrians to enter and exit. The Western District Branch of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association on Ma Gen Road sent a large number of detectives to guard against accidents. When the incident occurred, the shops along the way closed their doors to prevent beatings. They began to open their doors and do business as usual after 10:00 a.m. Traffic, such as buses and trolleybuses, etc., also resumed after 10:00 a.m., and everything returned to normal, but the police detectives were still stationed there. After this incident occurred, the registration office of the Labour Committee of the Municipal Council announced the temporary suspension of registration.</p>
<p>Detailed Statistics of Injuries to People and Damage to Vehicles: Regarding this sudden incident, according to investigations by the Dagong News Agency reporters to various parties, it was learned that more than ten rickshaw pullers were slightly injured, one police detective was injured, one Western police officer was injured, and a pistol was lost. As for the No. 10 buses that were damaged, there were four in total, with registration numbers 15063, 15033, 15026, and 15009. There were five trolleybuses damaged, with numbers 32, 322, 356, 299, and 302. All of them had damages to the glass and bodywork, but there were no major problems. The loss of the above nine buses and trolleybuses is around several hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Statement by the Labour Committee on This Matter: The person in charge of the Labour Committee issued the following statement to the Dagong News Agency reporter yesterday afternoon after the incident: This morning, more than 10,000 people went to the rickshaw puller registration office on Ma Gen Road to make trouble, but these more than 10,000 people were not rickshaw pullers, but mostly unemployed hooligans, and a very small number of rickshaw pullers who were exploited, as well as garbage collectors. Because according to the rickshaw puller registration method, the rickshaw owner must first obtain an application form, the rickshaw pullers were unwilling to make any expressions on that day. The reason why the Labour Committee restricts the registration of rickshaw pullers to only 5,000 people is none other than to seek to remedy the exploitation of rickshaw pullers and protect their interests. As for the reasons for the restrictions, the Labour Committee has previously published them. The Labour Committee will still accept rickshaw pullers who register with a letter from a rickshaw owner in accordance with formal procedures. According to the Labour Committee's investigation, most of the rickshaw pullers in Shanghai have already been registered, and there are really fewer than 20,000 who have not yet registered.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Owners' Expression on This Matter: The Dagong News Agency reporter also consulted with the persons in charge of the rickshaw owners last night about their views on this matter. According to them, today's matter is purely a problem of rickshaw pullers demanding a livelihood and has nothing to do with the rickshaw owners. However, the rickshaw owners had previously notified the Municipal Council that there are still 20,000 to 30,000 rickshaw pullers who have not yet registered. If the Municipal Council only restricts the registration of 5,000 people, there will inevitably be too many monks and too little gruel, and it will not be enough to distribute. Today, unfortunately, disturbances occurred. The rickshaw owners only hope that this matter can be resolved as soon as possible. Before the Labour Committee of the Municipal Council has a clear solution to this matter, the rickshaw owners do not want to make any expressions for the time being.</p>
<p>Chinese Directors Took Office Last Night to Mediate: The Chinese directors of the Municipal Council, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Jiang Yiping, etc., consider this matter to be a serious problem in the Public Concession, and they cannot bear to sit idly by and allow this matter to be delayed. They specifically contacted the Labour Committee and the rickshaw owners last night to mediate the rickshaw puller disturbance case yesterday morning, in order to resolve it as soon as possible, and asked the rickshaw owners to persuade the rickshaw pullers not to take any further action. The rickshaw owners have agreed and are willing to do their best to explain to the rickshaw pullers. At the same time, the representatives of the Rickshaw Owners Association, Yin Zhiling and Hou Shaoan, visited the chairman of the Labour Committee, Macy, and members Zhu Maocheng and Wang Zhiren at the Municipal Council yesterday morning to discuss the handling methods.</p>

<h3>Fish Market Board of Directors Hold Meeting: Banquet for Wang Xiaolai and Others</h3>
<p>Wang Ding to Enter Beijing Tonight to Consult Wu on All Matters; Board of Directors to Discuss and Amend Business Regulations This Morning</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fish Market, sponsored by the Ministry of Industry, held its inaugural meeting in Shanghai on the 10th. After the election of officials and business representatives to the board of directors and supervisors, preparations for its establishment were actively underway. Mr. Wang Xiaolai, the General Manager of the market, returned to Shanghai yesterday. The Standing Committee of the Board of Directors held a banquet last night at the East Asia Restaurant to welcome Standing Director Wang Xiaolai, Deputy Managers Zhu Kaiguan and Sun Yichen, and former Manager Yu Kaizhan. Among those present were Standing Director and Chairman of the Board of Directors Du Yuesheng, Standing Directors Tang Chengzong, Fang Jiaobo, and Gui Yanfang. Standing Director Xu Tinghu was unable to attend due to a trip to Beijing. The meeting discussed the market's preparation policy, the date of takeover, and other matters, adjourning at 9 p.m. Mr. Wang Xiaolai is scheduled to take the night express to Beijing tonight to consult with Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang on all matters. He is expected to return to Shanghai tomorrow and plans to take over the fish market on the 17th, appointing Directors Lin Kanghou and Zhang Fayao as the receivers. The Ministry will send Secretary Qian to supervise the inventory. The Board of Directors is also scheduled to hold a standing meeting at 10 a.m. today. The market preparatory committee specially notified Directors Du, Tang, Fang, Xu, Gui, and Wang of the meeting, scheduled for 10 a.m. on the 15th of this month, at the Zhonghui Building, 1st floor, to discuss business regulations. It is also understood that today's meeting will only discuss business regulations, so only Tang Chengzong, Qu Hemen, Fang Jiaobo, Gui Yanfang, and Yu Kaizhan will attend. These five individuals have been designated as responsible for amending the regulations. General Manager Wang Xiaolai and Deputy Managers Sun Guchen and Zhu Kaiguan will also be present. According to Tang Chengzong, Standing Director of the Shanghai Fish Market, the establishment of the market is primarily to assist the fishing industry, to promote the production and sales of fish through regulation, and to reduce the burden on fishermen. Following the Japanese fish market's fish cargo sales procedure, producers (i.e., fishermen or fish farmers) sell their fish to wholesalers, who then seek to sell it to the fish market. The market uses an auction method, with brokers buying and then reselling to fishmongers, who then sell directly to consumers. Thus, fish passes through five stages from production to consumption. The current transaction sequence in Shanghai's fish industry is: producers sell to fish shops, fish shops sell to fishmongers, and fishmongers sell to consumers, only four stages. Historically, the focus of fish trading in this city has been on the fish shops, a practice that has been followed for many years. Fish shops and producers have various deep business relationships. Once the market opens, if the centuries-old habits are suddenly changed, there will inevitably be many obstacles. In the future, a gradual approach will be adopted to achieve the purpose of establishing the fish market. As for the fishermen, they are eager for the establishment of the market. Representatives of offshore fishermen, such as Xu Yifei, have been campaigning and appealing, as repeatedly reported in the newspapers. The reduction of the burden on fishermen after the opening will be strived for. In short, the business regulations of the fish market are currently being revised, taking into account the above situation and considering all aspects. They will be submitted to the Board of Directors for approval and then submitted to the Ministry of Industry for promulgation. As for the takeover date, it has been decided to proceed on the 17th of this month.</p>

<h3>National Goods Groups Hold Banquet for Wu Dingchang: Promoting National Goods Does Not Mean Excluding Foreign Goods</h3>
<p>The China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association and the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association held a banquet at the Bank Association Club at 12 p.m. the day before yesterday to welcome Wu Dingchang, Minister of Industry, and factory inspection specialists Cen Depeng and Gu Yuchuan. The guests included Minister Wu, Cen Depeng, Gu Yuchuan, Wang Shiding, Liu Shimu, Pan Yangyao, and others, as well as factory representatives Cai Shengbai, Chen Diexian, Fang Yexian, Wang Xingyao, Hu Xiyuan, Xiang Kangyuan, Zhang Huikang, Lao Jingxiu, Fang Jiange, Ren Shigang, Ye Youcai, Xu Xiaochu, Hu Shicheng, and others, totaling more than 60 people. During the banquet, Chairman Zhang Huikang delivered a welcome speech, stating that it was an honor for the national goods community that Minister Wu could come to provide guidance amidst his busy schedule. Minister Wu was also a leader in the industrial and commercial community, so he knows the pain of the industrial and commercial community and will certainly be able to improve and expand our industry and commerce in the future. Minister Wu then delivered a training speech, saying that national goods factories have made significant progress in their difficult operations. The government feels that the current economic situation is closely related to politics and pays great attention to development. Therefore, the Executive Yuan has sent specialists to inspect various national goods factories. On the government's side, it is currently trying to promote the sales of national goods. At least in the three items of clothing, food, and housing, we must use our own goods. Soviet Russia is also an economically backward country, but they wear less, eat less, live less well, and use the best things to exchange for the tools produced by other countries. We can certainly wear well, eat well, and live well, but we cannot use our own Chinese goods, because our own things can provide us with comfortable production in terms of clothing, food, and housing. Our promotion of national goods does not mean excluding foreign goods. We should still make the most of foreign goods for production tools. As for the manufacture and promotion of national goods, that still depends on the efforts of the factories themselves. The government will, of course, help as much as possible within its power. In addition, Cai Shengbai, Wang Xingyao, Lu Zhixue, Xiang Kangyuan, and others successively expressed their opinions on improving industry and commerce. The guests and hosts dispersed happily at around 3 p.m.</p>

<p>Encountering Fog and Running Aground</p>
<p>On the morning of the 11th, the ship arrived at the Longkou sea area outside Zhifu, near Shihuzui. There was fog on the sea, and the ship ran aground on a hidden reef. The hull was stuck and could not move. The shipowner initially wanted to use full speed to reverse and get off the shoal, but because there were many goods and passengers on board and the draft was deep, the shipowner did not dare to move the ship again. He urgently telegraphed for help from Yantai, Tianjin, Longkou, and other places. The Shanghai branch also received this report yesterday.</p>
<p>Offloading Cargo and Passengers</p>
<p>Currently, several barges have been dispatched from Yantai and Longkou to the Shihuzui area.

Then, the bottom of the hold will be inspected for any holes. Only then can the ship be lightened with the high tide and floated to the surface. It can then be towed out of the shoal. The extent of the loss is currently unknown.</p>

<h3>Boiling Oil Accidentally Splashed on Young Girl's Face, Causing Excruciating Pain and Rolling on the Ground, Cold Water Poured Over Her</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday evening, a Ningbo woman, Dai Zhou, residing at No. 17 Xuexi Street in the city, took her six-year-old daughter, Xiangjun, to Wenfuqi Noodle Restaurant at No. 3 Xueqian Street for refreshments. After they sat down, the restaurant staff, eager to cook noodles for the arriving customers, moved the oil pot used for stir-frying on the stove, replacing it with a noodle pot. Unexpectedly, due to carelessness, the boiling oil in the pot splashed onto the girl's head, face, hands, and feet. Instantly, she experienced excruciating pain and rolled on the ground.

<h3>Widow Accuses Clansmen of Demolishing Her House</h3>
<p>Xia Li, a widow from Xiacaoche Residence, Leicao Township, West Shanghai, recently filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the Local Court against her clansmen Xia Liansheng, Xia Gengsheng, Xia Xiangsheng, Xia Zhou, Xia [blank], Xia Wang, Xia Ni, Xia Shanyun, and eight others, accusing them of jointly destroying her building out of spite. Yesterday morning, Judge Li Xuedeng opened the court for trial. Both parties appeared in court as summoned. Xia Li stated that she was 38 years old, her husband had passed away early, leaving behind only one daughter, and she was lonely and often bullied. On February 8th and February 13th of the lunar calendar this year, the defendants twice demolished her thatched cottage. She requested legal punishment and demanded compensation. Defendant Xia Liansheng denied demolishing the house. Xia Gengsheng and Xia Xiangsheng jointly stated that the thatched cottage was prone to fire and was ordered by the police station to be demolished within a time limit, so they demolished the thatched cottage they had built. Xia Li's thatched cottage was adjacent, so it collapsed, and so on. Xia Zhou and others claimed that they had not demolished the house. Witness Lu Huanquan and others testified that they witnessed Xia Zhou and others demolishing the house that day. The judge noted that the testimonies were conflicting and would be investigated further.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Puller Attempts to Kill Police Officer with Knife Because the Officer Took Away His Permit, Arrested and Charged with Attempted Murder</h3>
<p>Rickshaw puller Wang Genlang, 44 years old, from Haimen, residing at No. 2, Lane 4, Liyuan Road, was pulling his rickshaw past the intersection of Jin Shenfu Road and La Fitte Road at 7:30 the night before. Because he did not obey the police officer's instructions, officer No. 740 took away his permit No. 15023. Wang Genlang became enraged and rushed to the [blank] meat stall set up by [blank] and Long at the intersection of La Fitte Road, seized a meat cleaver, and attempted to kill officer No. 740. Fortunately, officer No. 43 saw it, stepped forward to take the knife, arrested Wang, and took him to the police station.

<h3>Zheng Meikang Sues Mother-in-Law for Enticement Due to Wife's Departure, Wife Arrives in Court During Trial, Acquittal After Investigation</h3>
<p>Zheng Meikang (26 years old), a postal administration employee from Ningbo, residing at No. 221, Changle Lane, Dixiwei Road, married Yang Shimei (21 years old), a woman from the same hometown, in 1931. Since the marriage, Yang attended China Women's Middle School. Recently, she became pregnant and gave birth this month. Due to a difficult labor, she was sent to a sanatorium for delivery. She gave birth to a boy. When she returned home on the 31st of last month, Yang left with the child around 7:00 PM on April 1st without saying goodbye. That night, Yang's mother, Yang Guo, went to Zheng's house to demand the return of the person. Zheng Meikang believed that his mother-in-law had come to his house a few hours before his wife left, so he suspected that his mother-in-law, Yang Guo, had enticed his wife to hide. He filed a lawsuit against his mother-in-law with the First Special District Court for the crime of disrupting the family. Since his wife took away a 1,000-yuan deposit book from Siming Bank when she left, he filed a civil suit demanding its return. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Xie [blank] of Criminal Court No. 5 summoned him for questioning. Zheng Meikang stated the previous situation in his petition and requested legal punishment. Yang Guo stated that on April 1st, because her daughter returned home from the hospital, she prepared some dishes and went to visit her. She returned home soon after. She did not know about her daughter's departure beforehand and had no enticement. She only found out after being notified by the plaintiff's family. Yang Shimei was also summoned to the case by Judge Xiao. She stated that after she gave birth in the hospital, the plaintiff was unwilling to pay the medical expenses and only paid them after being forced to, but he was reluctant. After returning home, her aunt and the other woman expelled her, saying that if she didn't leave, they would beat her. She had no choice but to leave with the child and live at her maternal uncle Guo Jinhe's house in Pudong. It was not her mother's instigation. Subsequently, witnesses Dai Hu, Xu Wang, Li Chunquan, Shen Boliang, etc. were presented by both parties. Some proved that Yang Guo did go to Zheng's house before Yang Shimei left, and some proved that Yang Shimei did go to her maternal uncle's house that night. Judge Xiao reviewed the testimony and acquitted Yang Guo in court and dismissed the plaintiff's incidental civil suit. He also instructed both parties to reconcile out of court and not to litigate, so that the feelings of both parties would not reach an irreparable point.</p>
<h3>Shi Meiliang Sends Newborn Daughter to Police Station, Falsely Claims Lost Girl, Unable to Support Daughter After Unemployment, Shi Meiliang's Circumstances Are Understandable</h3>
<p>Shi Meiliang, a Ningbo native residing at No. 1420, Avenue Edward VII, 34 years old, took a twelve-year-old girl, [blank], to the Huishi Police Station at 11:30 the night before. He reported that he saw this child lost on Henan Road a moment ago, so he sent her to the police station. It was later found by the Chinese and Western detectives that the girl's name was Shi Chiying, and she was actually Shi Meiliang's biological daughter. He was ordered to be detained because Shi should not have fabricated a lie and intended to abandon his biological daughter. Seeing that the girl's face was injured, she was sent to the sanatorium to verify that her eyelid was slightly injured. Yesterday morning, Shi Meiliang was escorted to Criminal Court No. 8 of the First Special Court. Police Station lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a lawsuit for abandonment under Article 294 of the Criminal Law and stated the case. When questioned, Shi Meiliang stated that the girl, Shi Chiying, was indeed his biological daughter, now twelve years old. Because she often urinates and defecates messily and has bad behavior, his couple often quarreled. He used to do business in silk stores, but he is now unemployed and stuck at home, so he was worried and wanted to send Chiying to the Women and Children's Relief Association for temporary custody. Because it was late last night, there was no one in the association. He turned to the Shaoxing [blank] Township Association, but no one would accept her, so he went to the Huishi Police Station, intending to entrust the police station to transfer her to the Relief Association. Because of a temporary confusion, he falsely claimed that he had found her on the road. Judge Liu reviewed the testimony and ruled that Shi was not guilty because his circumstances were understandable. Shi Chiying was temporarily sent to the Relief Association for foster care.</p>

<h3>Detective Peeps from Hotel, Extorting Money for Amusement, Arrested, National Doctor Lu Mujun Extorted 5,000 Yuan by Gang, Three People Involved, Including Father and Son, Arrested in Lane</h3>
<p>No. 44 Shanquan Lane, Longquan Garden Road, is the clinic of National Doctor Lu [blank] and his [blank] Zhao Lin. On the 23rd of last month, Lu Mujun suddenly received a threatening letter from the gang, demanding 5,000 yuan. The wording in the letter generally stated that someone intended to harm Lu Zhaolin and was willing to pay 10,000 yuan for his life. They had already paid 5,000 yuan in advance. Now, in order to mediate and settle the matter, please pay 5,000 yuan immediately, then this matter can be canceled. The delivery location is at the iron gate at the entrance of Shanquan Lane. Lu ignored the letter after receiving it. Unexpectedly, on the 2nd of this month, he received another letter, with similar wording and delivery location. Lu Mujun reported the letter to the Old [blank] Police Station. The detective was ordered to wait at the agreed location on the 4th, but the gangster did not come as promised. On the 10th of the month, another letter arrived, instructing to place the money in the hole under the iron gate at the entrance of Shanquan Lane at 10:00 PM on the 10th. Someone would come to pick it up. After reporting to the police station, Chinese detective Lang [blank] Tang went to the Da Shang Hotel and opened room 217. Because the window of the room faced the iron gate of Shanquan Lane, Detective Lang was stationed in the room. Chinese detectives Zhu Shanghe, Cao Qishan, Gao Yongan, and Zhang Keqin disguised themselves as peddlers, rickshaw pullers, etc. and ambushed near the lane. Around 10:00 PM that day, a man came forward and took out the paper bag placed under the iron gate by the detectives. At that time, Detective Lang saw it in room 217 and immediately sent a signal. The detectives ambushing around rushed forward and arrested the man. His name was Ye Aweng, a Ningbo native, living at No. 30 Shanquan Lane. At that moment, [blank] in Shanquan Lane [blank] Dongliang [blank] Yesong [blank], suddenly came out to stop the detectives from arresting him, saying that A [blank] was a relative. They were about to [blank] the detectives when Ye and his son were arrested together and taken back to the police station. It was learned that the matter was initiated by an Aqing. Ye Aweng followed him. Ye Dongliang and Ye Songnian knew about it. They immediately ordered the arrest of A [blank], who escaped after hearing the news. Yesterday morning, the three Ye were escorted to Criminal Court No. 1 of the First Special District Court. Police Station lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the case. Further investigation was needed, and a postponement was requested. After Judge Feng Shide questioned the defendants, he ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Inland Waterway Shipping Association Strives to Eliminate Cargo Boat Tax, Subcommittee Has Drafted Report, Requests City Chamber of Commerce to Submit to Central Relief</h3>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, the local Inland Waterway Shipping Industry Association believes that the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau's collection of cargo boat tax on tugboats is illegal and duplicates taxation, so they have unanimously protested and organized a subcommittee to study and discuss the protest methods and their legal basis. A subcommittee has drafted a report on the results of the discussion and submitted it to the 71st Executive Committee of the association for approval. The following is a summary of the conclusions of the report: Before the promulgation of the Regulations on the Management of Tugboats, the Finance Bureau's collection of cargo boat tax does not violate the law. Although the boat tax is a legitimate local tax, tugboats pay boat money to the customs on a regular basis, so the Finance Bureau's additional collection of cargo boat tax is indeed a duplication of national income. The nature of Shanghai's civil boats is different from tugboats, so they cannot be exempted from boat tax by analogy. Therefore, the city's boat tax will not be affected by the elimination of cargo boat tax on tugboats. Tugboats are vessels that pay tax to the customs and should be treated the same as steamers, port sailboats, etc. They meet the legal basis of Article [blank] of the Shanghai [blank] Special City Regulations for Eliminating Cargo Boat Penalties. The Detailed Rules for the Collection of Boat Tax by the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau were only amended and promulgated by the Municipal Government's instructions on February 11, 20th year of the Republic, and were not submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review and record in accordance with the Interim Law on Supervising Local Finance, which is a dereliction of duty to collect from the people. After the association passed the report of the subcommittee, it decided to continue to strive to achieve the goal of eliminating the tax. Its letter (letter from the president omitted) and attached report requested the City Chamber of Commerce to submit it to the Central Political Council [blank] the Executive Yuan to continue its efforts.</p>
<h3>New Life Movement Headquarters Thoroughly Investigates Fundraising in Shanghai Under False Names, Municipal New Life Movement Association Sends Letter to Public Security Bureau to Investigate</h3>
<p>The local New Life Movement Promotion Association received a letter from the New Life Movement Promotion Headquarters yesterday, stating: Since the establishment of the association, it has never solicited donations from any party. The various publications printed by the association are also distributed to all sectors of society for free and have never been charged. Recently, a certain Western newspaper in Shanghai published information about the New Life Movement publications in Guan under the name of the association, which not only damages the reputation of the association, but also hinders the promotion of the New Life Movement. In order to avoid misunderstandings from all parties, in addition to sending a letter to the public security organs for investigation, it is solemnly stated again that if such situations are found in the future, it is hoped that they will be sent to the local public security organs for investigation in accordance with the law, so as to serve as a warning to others. After receiving the report, the local New Life Movement Promotion Association has transferred a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, ordering it to pay attention to the investigation.</p>
<h3>China Foreign Joint Relief Association Relief General Association Transfers Four-Province Cooperation Undertaking to Economic Committee for Handling</h3>
<p>The China Foreign Joint Relief Disaster Relief General Association, located at No. 505 Henan Road, is the pioneer of rural cooperative societies in China. There are now more than 1,000 societies in Hebei Province, and there are plans to gradually promote them in various provinces. In the spring of 1932, the association was entrusted by the National Government's Flood Relief Committee to handle the closure of agricultural relief in the four provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei. After the closure, the association's offices in Anhui and Jiangxi and the Hunan and Hubei sub-associations separately organized rural cooperation matters in their respective provinces, which achieved considerable success. Farmers found it convenient. Later, the National Economic Committee was established, and all the undertakings of the Flood Relief Committee were transferred to its jurisdiction. In November 1934, the Righteous Relief General Association believed that the four-province cooperation undertaking was entrusted in nature, and since a competent authority had been established, it should be transferred to it for handling. It sent a letter to the Economic Committee requesting it to take it back and handle it itself, but it has not been implemented yet. [blank] After the Economic Committee established the Cooperative Undertaking Committee, it sent a letter to the Consultative Relief General Association in December last year, requesting them to separately inform the Anhui and Jiangxi offices and the Hunan and Hubei sub-associations to compile a roster of employees, as well as a list of society names, files, funds, and public property, and send them to the committee first, so that they could arrange to send personnel to take over. The Righteous Relief General Association followed the instructions and sent special commissioners Xiong Guoqing and technician Wang Wu Ke to take over separately. All the procedures were completed last month, and the directors of the Cooperative Committee's offices in Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei were stationed there, and their work was proceeding as usual. The rest of the personnel remained unchanged.</p>

<h3>Xu Fuji, Judge of the Second Branch of the High Court, Is Accused of Debt Incurred by His Late Father, Xu [blank] Pursues More Than 11,000 Yuan, Transferred to Second Special Court Due to Jurisdictional Error</h3>
<p>Xu Fuji, the current judge of the Civil Court of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, is the son of the late lawyer Xu Bingcheng. When his father was practicing law in Shanghai, he had [blank] grievances with Xu [blank], who resided in Xiangxing Lane on Aierjin Road. He issued a promissory note for 8,000 taels of silver to Xu, which he was unable to pay when due. After his death, Xu believed that this debt should be inherited by Xu Fuji, so he sought compensation and has been urging him to pay for more than two years, without getting a penny. Now, lawyer Zhu Honglie has sued him in the First Special District Local Court, requesting that the defendant Xu Fuji be ordered to repay 1 [blank],000 yuan and interest and litigation costs in national currency in accordance with the statutory conversion rate. Judge Xu was sued and filed a statement, stating that his residence was at No. 12 Yude Lane, La Fitte Road, in the French Concession and was not under the jurisdiction of the First Special Court. Yesterday afternoon, when Judge Xu Gongdian opened the court for trial, Xu Fuji did not appear in court, but entrusted someone to represent him. However, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that the defendant was still employed by the High Court, so he filed a lawsuit in the court. The court ruled that the Second Branch of the High Court was the defendant's office, and since he had a residence, the court with jurisdiction should hear the case. The case was transferred to the Second Special District Local Court for review. The plaintiff and his representative lawyer withdrew.</p>
<p>Early Morning Robbery on Zhaojia Road</p>
<p>A Weng family at No. 7 Huishan Lane, Zhaojia Road in the South City, was suddenly attacked by six or seven robbers at 8:30 yesterday morning. They spoke in Jiangbei and local dialects and wore blue and black [blank] clothes.

<h3>Lawyer Guo Ci-mei Sues Zhu Yun-wang for Defamation</h3>
<p>Alleging Improper Conduct with His Daughter-in-law</p>
<p>Lawyer Guo Ci-mei, 39 years old and a native of Minhou, Fujian, joined the Shanghai Lawyers' Association as a member in May of the 4th year of the Republic [1915], practicing law. Recently, he suddenly filed a private prosecution with the Criminal Court of the District Court, accusing Zhu Yun-wang, a local merchant residing at No. 12, Tianzhutang Street, South City, of fabricating facts and defaming him, etc. The complaint stated in brief: In the autumn of last year, the plaintiff was engaged by the defendant's daughter-in-law, Zhu Shen Jing-fen (i.e., Mrs. Zhu Shen), who came to the plaintiff's office to request that the plaintiff represent her in a lawsuit before your court, seeking support from the defendant. The litigation lasted for a year and has already been finalized after three trials. Zhu Shen, burdened with heavy debts, requested to temporarily store her dowry and spare parts, etc., with the plaintiff, so that she could go to other ports to raise funds. The plaintiff, feeling pity for the orphaned woman, agreed to the storage. Unexpectedly, the defendant seized upon this as a pretext to falsely accuse the plaintiff of improper conduct with Zhu Shen. Subsequently, during the three trials, he fabricated facts in the complaint against Zhu Shen in various ways, damaging the plaintiff's reputation. All the newspapers in this city have reported on this. According to his actions, it is clear that he intended to defame the plaintiff. Therefore, the plaintiff requests legal action. Based on the complaint, the court, at 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon, had Criminal Court Presiding Judge Cai Ding-cheng preside over the trial in Criminal Court No. 12. The plaintiff, Guo Ci-mei, appeared in court and stated the prior circumstances. The defendant, Zhu Yun-wang, did not appear due to illness, but sent a lawyer as his agent, who replied that he had not yet received a copy of the plaintiff's complaint, did not know the cause of the case, and was unable to respond. He requested a postponement, which the presiding judge granted, and then the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>Li A-lin Saved After Jumping into the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Around 4:30 PM the day before yesterday, on the Zhapu Road Bridge over the Suzhou Creek, a young man suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide. Fortunately, a Chinese constable, number ten, from the Customs Water Police Station, saw him and quickly rescued him. He was brought back to the police station, where he identified himself as Li A-lin, 29 years old, from Tongzhou. He stated that due to unemployment and boredom, he had recently come to Shanghai from his hometown, seeking his brother but failing to find him. He then went to the Zhou residence to look for a friend, also without success. Mr. Zhou, taking pity on him, gave him ten silver dollars, intending to start a small business to make a living. However, while walking along Rue du Consulat in the French Concession, all the silver dollars vanished. In extreme frustration, he became weary of the world. The head constable instructed the officers to send him to the Tongxiang Association for assistance.</p>

<h3>"Ciyuan Bianzheng" (Corrections to the Ciyuan Dictionary) to be Published</h3>
<p>Since its publication, the "Ciyuan" dictionary by the Commercial Press has been widely used by all circles due to its comprehensive compilation and ease of reference. Wu Ren-jie, a staff member of the Jiangsu Educational Institute, has revised and corrected the main and supplementary volumes of the dictionary, consulting historical works and correcting errors.

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor of Shen Bao: Upon reading the "Local News and Miscellany" column of your newspaper on the 12th of this month, the news item "The Tiān Hòu Gōng Temple in Hongkou to be Consecrated Tomorrow" contains inaccurate facts, which has caused misunderstandings in the outside world and numerous inquiries. Upon investigation, our school has been established for more than ten years, and all the former site of the Tiān Hòu Gōng Temple and all the buildings have long been renovated and used by the school. The former shrines and other objects have also been burned. Therefore, the location of the Tiān Hòu Gōng Temple in Hongkou mentioned in your newspaper is not at our school and has nothing to do with the school. We hereby send this letter for clarification and request that you check and correct the facts. Sincerely, Zhai Shu-rong, Principal of Shanghai Municipal Shuji Primary School, April 14, 25th year of the Republic [1936].</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Health Report</h3>
<p>The Straw Hat Industry in Shanghai, compiled by China Credit Information (Shanghai Industry and Commerce Overview, No. 22)</p>
<p>Overview: The straw hat industry in Shanghai is divided into two categories: straw hat export firms and straw hat factories. Their business nature is completely different. The former uses imported materials, hand-woven by workers, and sells them abroad. The latter uses domestic straw braids, manufactured by machines, and sells them domestically. The two organizations are different and do not communicate with each other, but their speed of development and severity of decline are the same. The export of straw hats has been around for twenty years. At first, foreign firms in China used the low labor costs in our country to distribute golden silk grass and Manila hemp from Luzon to farmers in Ningbo, Yuyao, and Haimen to weave, and then sold them to various countries. Later, Chinese merchants established their own export firms and traded directly with foreign merchants. The foreign firms found it difficult to compete, so they gave up one after another. The 19th year of the Republic [1930] was the golden age of straw hat export firms. Later, due to the decline in purchasing power of various countries, coupled with the impact of Japanese paper hats and Italian rough hats, the market plummeted. The issue of raw material supply was also rumored that the Philippine government would ban exports, causing considerable panic. Looking back, the straw hat factory in Shanghai has only been in existence for over ten years, from its inception to its decline. In the 19th year of the Republic [1930], there were no less than ninety straw hat factories in the city, and those that announced their closure one after another were numerous. The rise of small-scale straw hat factories in the interior in recent years is also an important factor in the decline of Shanghai's straw hat factories.</p>
<p>Raw Materials and Manufacturing of Straw Hats: The raw materials for straw hats are divided into golden silk grass, Manila hemp, glass grass, and straw braids. Golden silk grass and Manila hemp are produced in Luzon, glass grass is produced in Switzerland, and straw braids are produced in the mountains of Hebei Province, etc. Those produced in Yexian, Yangxin, Cangxian, and Nanle are the most famous. In terms of value, glass grass is the most expensive. Roughly, the cost of each straw hat is 1.3 yuan for glass grass, 8 jiao for golden silk grass, and 8 fen for Manila hemp. Straw braids are made of wheat straw, and the quality varies. High-quality braids are worth 150 yuan per package, and rough braids are worth 40 yuan. Each package contains 240 pieces, each piece 120 yards long. Each package can make 50 dozen straw hats. Straw braid firms in Shanghai include Hengfeng, Hongxiangyuan, Qianhe Yong, and Hongchangxiang. In the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], imported Japanese wax-lined braids entered the market. Manufacturers were tempted by the profits. After the Fuyuan Straw Hat Factory tried it, many followed suit for a time. This type of braid is a semi-finished product and must be waxed and woven before it can be used. Currently, there are three wax-lining factories in Shanghai: Huacheng, Hefeng, and Gongli. Wax-lining braiding factories include Tianlun and Hongchang. Japanese wax-lined braids are a kind of cotton fabric that becomes soft when exposed to moisture, unlike our straw braids, which are durable. If users can distinguish them, they will know the flaws of Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Straw hat manufacturing is divided into manual and machine-made. Manual weaving is a superior product, which is exported. Machine-made hats are mostly rough and determined goods, which are used by all classes. Women in Ningbo, Yuyao, Haimen, and other places in our country, regardless of age, regard weaving straw hats as a sideline. In its heyday, it reached fifty residents. The procedure is simple, easy to learn, and the tools used are just a block of three-dimensional round wood. Export firms set up zhuang-kou in the above-mentioned areas, distribute raw materials, and entrust them to weave. After they are made, they are paid according to the quality of the work. Those who are skilled in weaving can produce one hat every five days. On average, they can also weave two or three hats per month. In the 19th year of the Republic [1930], the average monthly wage per person was 20 or 30 yuan. However, this piece-rate method often had drawbacks, such as mixing rough goods with fine goods, or reducing the ingredients. Therefore, current merchants sell raw materials and then buy them from farmers. After straw hats depreciated, export firms reduced wages for farmers in order to reduce costs. The female workers who used to earn an average of 30 yuan now earn only 10 yuan. These hat-weaving women must have artistic ideas, because foreign straw hat styles change suddenly, sometimes high-crowned, sometimes flat-crowned. Export firms pay attention to them at any time. When there are changes, they use leaflets or sound gongs to inform them, and they are happy to accept them. Ningbo and Yuyao mostly weave golden silk and glass hats, while Haimen mostly weaves Manila hemp hats. This is probably just a matter of habit.</p>
<p>The manufacturing period of straw hat factories in Shanghai is usually from January to June. After this period, large factories weave woolen hats, and small factories weave casual hats. The machines used to make straw hats are generally straw hat machines from the Singer Company. The Shanghai factories with the most equipment have 22 straw hat machines, and the least have one. There are 500 units in the city. The manufacturing steps are: 1. Winding the straw braid into the predetermined style of the straw hat. 2. Organize the semi-finished straw hat. 3. Add glue and Ding or cowhide glue. 4. First rough drying. 5. Pressure machine. 6. Install cloth and leather rings. 7. Second drying.</p>
<p>Types of Straw Hats: The types of straw hats vary due to different raw materials. Strictly speaking, there are no less than 230 types. Generally, they are divided into three types: golden silk hats, Manila hemp hats, and glass hats. Golden silk hats can be divided into special, super, first-class, second-class, third-class, fourth-class, fifth-class rough goods. Manila hemp hats and glass hats also have super, first-class, second-class, third-class, fourth-class, fifth-class, and substandard goods, but only lack a special grade. The straw hats woven by Shanghai straw hat factories have always been divided into soft hats and hard hats. Since the import of Japanese wax-lined braids, there have been cotton wool products and mixed products of cotton wool and straw braids, but they are generally called straw hats.</p>
<p>Straw Hat Business: The straw hat export season is from September to April of the following year. Foreign additions in summer are only a coincidence. Australian business is mostly based on orders during the fall season. Export firms have agents in New York, London, Paris, and Hamburg. The firms report the prices of goods to foreign firms at any time and negotiate by telegram. If a transaction is concluded, the firm will issue a sales order, recording the color, quantity, price, and delivery date. It is stipulated that foreign bank customers must open a bank letter of credit by telegram. Some firms also credit foreign customers, remit their own remittances, or sell off. The Straw Hat Export Association has formulated business regulations to protect the interests of the industry. Among them, Article 10, which belongs to foreign firms, states: 1. Those who fail to open a bank letter of credit or delay in doing so, 2. Those who unreasonably return goods, 3. Those who abuse the price of goods, 4. Those who have gone bankrupt or have no credit may notify the industry and stop dealing with the foreign firms. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Random Notes</h3>
<p>— (Tang Zeng-geng)</p>
<p>A person's genius, whether mediocre or outstanding, cannot determine his future failure or success. A mediocre genius, if he can work hard and bury himself in hard work without fear of any difficulties, will eventually achieve satisfactory success. On the contrary, a person with outstanding genius who relies solely on his own genius and is arrogant and careless, will end up falling deeply into the trap of failure. Therefore, I advise all my mediocre genius friends, please do not lose the courage to work hard because your genius is mediocre, and do not be content to be backward and passive; at the same time, those friends with outstanding genius, please do not ruin your bright future because of your outstanding talent, and of course, you cannot despise everything because of your luck.</p>
<p>A life gained by genius is bitter and uninteresting. A life gained by struggle is meaningful and worthy of praise. Friends, there are two paths of "genius" and "struggle" in front of you. Which one will you choose?</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Words from Piaocheng</h3>
<p>— A Yuan</p>
<p>Jiangbei Yancheng is also known as Piaocheng because of its shape. It is a first-class county in Lixiahe, so there is a commissioner stationed in the political aspect: in the economic aspect, the three banks of China Communications Farmers have branches; in the transportation aspect, Xiaolun is connected to Funing in the north, Dongtai in the east, and Taizhou Xinghua Shaobo in the southwest. In recent years, there have been Fuhu offshore vessels passing through the Nanyang port of the county, making it easier to transport salt and cotton. The newly planned Haidong Railway is also planned to be extended to this place; the prosperity of the future can be expected.</p>
<p>Education in Yancheng is extremely developed, and there are many people who are promoted to schools, with a total of about 1,000 university graduates, which is one of the best in Jiangsu. However, most of them study liberal arts and law, and if they have nothing to do at home, they run small newspapers, so there is a trend of advocating litigation. Recently, Shi Kuiling, a specialist, launched a campaign to stop litigation, but I am afraid it will not help. The general people are simple, hardworking, and good at saving. Although their daily life is simple clothing and vegetarian food, they are not affected by occasional famines. Compared with people in the Suzhou and Shanghai area, who wear silk clothes but have no rice for dinner at home, they cannot be compared.</p>
<p>In Lixiahe counties, such as Taizhou, Dongtai, Xinghua, and Yancheng, there are many prostitutes, so there is a saying, "When you arrive in Yu Hua, your heart is open, when you arrive in Yancheng, you don't want to go home." Taking Yancheng as an example, it is said that there are no less than 200 households. Usually, they do not dress up and go out to sell their charm; those who want to inquire are reported with wine, and then they can stay with the Kun. The Rouge from the North is different from the Golden Powder of the Southern Dynasties.</p>
<p>There is a town in the south of Yancheng called Biancang, which is famous for its dead branches and peonies. Jinghua Yuan's book also mentions this matter. However, what is said is slightly different from the Yancheng County Chronicles. The County Chronicles roughly say: At the end of the Yuan Dynasty, Bian Yuanheng entered Zhang Shicheng's curtain and made many contributions. When Shicheng was defeated, he lived in seclusion in Yandu Biancang. Emperor Taizu of Ming Dynasty called him but he did not come out. In anger, he left him to guard Liaodong. Before leaving, he poured wine on the peony planted by his hand and said, "Wait for me to return south, and the flowers will bloom again." Since then, they have not contained buds for ten years. One year, in the wind and snow, the flowers were extravagant, and Yuanheng was pardoned and returned. Later, they were stolen by the salt envoy and planted in the official residence, and they withered and were abandoned. The Bian family picked up the dead ones and cultivated them to germinate again, and they became lush for a long time, so they were called dead branches and peonies. The colors are divided into red and white, and the area can be half an acre. Xia Zhirong's poem says, "Strange Bian's double pearl flowers, white as fragrant snow and red as morning glow," is also chanting this. Every year, on Guyu, people from all directions come to watch, and they are crowded and crowded, and they are prosperous for a while. In the spring of Yihai, Yu once went to enjoy it during the spare time of lecturing and recorded a poem: Where is the peony good? Biancang is in Huainan. Dead branches are famous for their stability, and their beauty is truly kingly. I also work for flowers during Guyu today. Now, in the spring of flowers and willows, the commander is about to arrive again. Will the elegant guests of Jiangnan come for a visit?</p>
<h3>Seeking Wife Advertisement</h3>
<p>— Li Qin</p>
<p>Losing a person necessitates posting several missing person advertisements, which seems to have become a fixed method for finding someone. Even the way these advertisements are written follows a certain pattern: a narrow, elongated piece of paper with two large characters written horizontally at the top, "尋人" (Seeking Person), and the character "人" (person) is written upside down as "人." Writing the character upside down involves elements of phonetics, psychology, hope, auspicious sayings, and so on. To put it more plainly, "人倒人到" (person upside down, person arrives), meaning that going out will bring good fortune. Although this kind of talk may seem naive and laughable, it is a "national custom" inherited from our Chinese history of five thousand years. Just as a Taoist priest uses a talisman to summon heavenly gods and generals to capture demons, such wonderful tales can all be categorized within this realm. Apart from the convention of writing the character "人" upside down, the remaining wording also follows a certain formula. For example, it begins by stating "今因走失××一口" (Now, due to the loss of one member of family ××). Then, it proceeds to describe the missing person's name, age, appearance, build, native place, accent, and the style and material of the clothing they were wearing when they disappeared. Finally, realizing that one's own search efforts may not be sufficient, it appeals to "仁人君子" (benevolent people and gentlemen) with an inquiring tone, saying, "如有知其下落，因而尋獲送到某地某處者：酬洋若干。" (If anyone knows their whereabouts and can find them and deliver them to such and such a place: a reward of so many foreign dollars will be offered). Offering a reward for finding someone is a matter of course. As the sages said, "君子喻於義，小人喻於利." (The gentleman understands righteousness; the petty man understands profit.) China is not a purely virtuous country like the one in "鏡花緣" (Flowers in the Mirror). The structure of society is formed by a mixed organization of both gentlemen and petty men. Therefore, if one relies on the great effort of others, one must consider the imbalance between obligation and right, and balance the heavy burden on a level playing field. Otherwise, which gentleman or petty man would help to bring it to fruition? This kind of attached condition can indeed be regarded as logical and consistent with social philosophy. Finally, closely following "酬洋若干" (a reward of so many foreign dollars), a special ending tag is added: "儲欵以待，决不食言" (Funds are reserved to await, and we will definitely not break our word). This ending tag is also very necessary and generous because, without it, people would not know that the legal tender in his pocket is 麥克麥克 (full of money). In short, this composition method is very meticulous and flawless. Since the initial inventor or creator passed down this archetype, when later generations encounter missing persons and need to write several missing person advertisements, they always follow the same pattern, imitating it exactly. No one dares to violate this rule. However, recently, I discovered that a friend named Dan Yang Yanling at a certain place unfortunately lost his wife. He didn't have legal tender to place an advertisement in the newspaper, so he copied old articles and wrote hundreds of "Seeking Wife Advertisements," posting them in the alleyways and streets of towns and villages in the surrounding areas. However, as soon as his "Seeking Wife Advertisement" was posted on any wall, it caused a sensation, attracting many people to stop and watch. This appeal lies in the composition of his "Seeking Wife Advertisement," which reverses the previous pattern. It can be said to be the first revolutionary shot since the advent of missing person advertisements, full of wit and a dignified demeanor reminiscent of Confucius being besieged in Chencai and still not ceasing his stringed instrument songs. Below is the original text of the "Seeking Wife Advertisement": "Mei Xia, my dear sister: Why did you leave and not return? Our old mother is worried and has fallen ill, and the children are crying from hunger and cold. I search everywhere during the day, and my intestines twist nine times at night. All the affairs at home are in a state of disarray. Since we got married, five years have passed in a flash. I have never treated you badly, yet you treat me like a fool. You go out to play every day, and come back late at night. Sometimes you spend the night out, claiming to be accompanying your sisters. What exactly is going on? I've been really unlucky! You are so hard-hearted, abandoning your family affairs. Although I work outside, I only earn eight dollars a month. Life is very difficult, and our finances are tight. Yesterday, my mother-in-law came to our house and wailed and shouted at me, demanding that I find you within three days. If I don't find you within the time limit, how will I explain myself? Otherwise, she will sue me, and it will truly be a matter of life and death. I hope you will change your mind, and return immediately upon seeing this letter! Do not be tempted by others, to avoid future regret. Think of the deep love between husband and wife, and the precious mirror can be reunited. I will definitely not investigate the past, and we will maintain our love for each other. I don't have the legal tender to publish an advertisement in the newspaper, so I can only speak on paper. If you still don't return, I will try to commit suicide. I hope you will have great compassion and not make things difficult for me any further! I hereby sincerely inform you, Mei Xia, my dear sister."</p>
<h3>Bamboos After Rain</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>Dancing</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>"Dancing to save the country" may be a thing of the past, but this year's Shanghai can truly be called the "Year of Dancing." Generally speaking, the era of shouting slogans has passed, and we have entered the era of implementation.</p>
<p>"Dancing" involves a man embracing a woman, following the rhythm of the music, stepping forward and backward in a measured pace. This was originally a Western pastime. Some gentlemen who like to say "We have it in China too" claim that "dancing" existed in our country during the Second Dynasty. However, let's be clear, the ancient dances in our country never involved a man embracing a woman in that way, did they? Some people say that dancing is quite hygienic, a type of indoor exercise. However, I have seen people who are addicted to dancing become thin and pale, and mentally disturbed. I have never seen anyone extend their life and cure illnesses through dancing. Fearing that relying on dancing to improve health is like taking opium every day to cure illness, it's a bit like that.</p>
<p>Westerners regard dancing as a form of social interaction, a refined form of entertainment. Naturally, "We have it in China too." Don't you see that tea dances are held to welcome and send off foreign guests? However, dancing is not necessarily absolutely refined in foreign countries either. Dancers in New York, Paris, and other places are always so tempting. We have that in China too, of course. Where? In small dance halls where one dollar buys eight, ten, or even twelve dances. There, it is full of the colors found in nightclubs in places like New York and Paris.</p>
<p>One dollar for ten, even twelve dances, can be said to have exhausted the possibilities of "cheap prices." But business is really difficult to do these days, and dance hall owners are no exception. Because shrewd dance patrons are bringing in dance partners they hired at even cheaper prices, the dance girls are sitting all night in "matchmaking shops," earning nothing, and quietly facing the non-dancers who are asking for a cup of plain water and setting up "character-splitting stalls" from beginning to end. Suppliers and consumers, those who have too much and those who are left over, perhaps economists can find a lot to analyze in this. However, the reality tells us that dance hall owners are all frowning and sighing, even though this year is a fully-fledged "Year of Dancing."</p>
<h3>Statement</h3>
<p>We have received a letter from Mr. A Yuan, stating that the "Water Lily" article by Qi Dong, published on March 4th in the "A Spring of Leisure Spent Admiring Flowers" special page, was actually plagiarized from his old work previously published in another newspaper. Such literary thieves are truly detestable. We do not know who Qi Dong is, and in addition to canceling his compensation, we will also impose a reputational penalty. This statement is made to this effect.</p>
<h3>Swapping the Phoenix in the Nest</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Prologue: Appreciating Chrysanthemums Near the Double Ninth Festival for a Secluded Gathering, Stringing Pearls Revisits Old Dreams, Drinking Hatred for a Thousand Autumns</p>
<p>Lan Chang raised his teacup to me and said with a smile, "Have a bowl of tea first, then read the documents. Don't start guessing before you see them. If you're so nervous, everyone I've invited today will become characters in a book." Hearing him say this made me feel like I was overthinking things, so I followed his advice, calmed myself down, took a few sips of tea, and then opened the cloth package. Inside, I found three thick notebooks. The notebooks had blue cloth covers and yellow silk bookmarks, with the words "含悲集" (Collection of Sorrow) written on them. I flipped through all three books and found that they were all handwritten in very elegant cursive script. There were diaries, poems, letters, and even bills, all completely unorganized manuscripts. These manuscripts were about someone's life, that much could be said. However, one couldn't make heads or tails of this kind of writing by glancing at it, so I had to put it down. There was also a stack of Xuan paper poetry slips with vermilion silk grids, some with antique-style bronze cauldron patterns printed on them. The slips were also written in a very flowing Su style. The title at the top of the slip read "石點館新聯珠" (New Linked Pearls of the Stone Dot Pavilion), followed by "惜玉外史戲擬" (Jaded Historian's Playful Imitation). I said, "These poetry slips are also from another person's hand. What's going on?" Lan Chang said, "Ah! Yes. Mr. Ruan said that there are twenty-four Linked Pearls in these documents. Just read through these Linked Pearls once, and you'll understand." So I moved the poetry slips to the middle of the tea table, dragged my chair next to Lan Chang, and we both looked at them together. Each Linked Pearl was marked with a number, so I looked at the first one:</p>
<p>"蓋聞蘭生空谷，流泉度其孤芳，月落秋階，蒼鶴憐其皓魄。是以高山一曲，焦桐託生死之交．落花無言，巾車感相逢之晚。"</p>
<p>"It is said that orchids grow in empty valleys, and flowing springs nurture their solitary fragrance. The moon sets on autumn steps, and gray cranes pity their bright souls. Therefore, a tune from a high mountain expresses a friendship that transcends life and death, and fallen flowers are silent, as the curtained carriage feels the lateness of their meeting."</p>
<p>I nodded and said, "Okay, this is talking about the beginning of a friendship between two people. But it already has a sad tone at the beginning." Lan Chang said, "Don't interrupt yet. Keep reading." So I opened the second poetry slip and read the second poem.</p>
<p>"蓋聞二南之叶，好逮爲往晢所不能諱言。三問之辭，鐘情亦騷人所有以自託。故銅溝流翠，有緣得葉上之詩，彩鳳求凰，憐才悟零中之意。"</p>
<p>"It is said that the harmony of the Two Nans cannot be concealed by even the wise men of the past. The words of the Three Questions express affections that the poets also use to confide in. Therefore, in the Bronze Ditch, there is a chance to receive poems on leaves, and the colorful phoenix seeks its mate, understanding the meaning within the droplets."</p>
<p>"蓋聞春風巷陌，絲柳情長。烟雨江頭，盡樓夢冷……"</p>
<p>"It is said that in the spring breeze alleys, the silk willows are full of emotion. At the misty riverside, the dreams in the towers are cold..."</p>
<p>When I saw the eight characters below, I found them a bit difficult to understand, so I couldn't help but prop my hand under my chin and think deeply. Unexpectedly, at this time, Lan Chang didn't notice me and had already read several more poems. I stopped speculating and continued reading downwards, to the eighth poem.</p>
<p>"蓋聞求三年之艾，雖扁鵲莫起沉疴。索十萬之錢，是天孫允須重聘。故灰盡万心，商女不知亡國恨。撑將淚眼，落花猶似　樓人。（九）"</p>
<p>"It is said that seeking wormwood that is three years old, even Bian Que cannot cure a persistent illness. Demanding a hundred thousand coins is what the Heavenly Grandson surely needs for a second betrothal. Therefore, all hearts are reduced to ashes, and the singing girl does not know the hatred of the fallen kingdom. Straining tearful eyes, the falling flowers still resemble people in the tower.

<h3>Chinese-Western Boxing Match, Wang Yonglan Defeats Sayer, Wang's Performance is Excellent, Opponent Falls to the Ground after Being Hit, Ben Menghua is Defeated, Chinese Win Five Groups in Total</h3>
<p>The Chinese-Western boxing match was held last night in the Western District, with a total of ten groups. Except for one Westerner's match in the eighth group due to abandonment, nine Chinese members took turns to fight. As a result, they won five and lost four, achieving excellent results. Of the four athletes in the 32nd Year, only Li Menghua lost in the last heavyweight group. The rest all won. Wang Yonglan's fighting style in the ninth group was highly praised by Chinese and Westerners. In the second round, he knocked down his opponent Sayer twice. The first time, he hit his opponent's right forehead, causing him to stagger and fall to the ground, unable to get up. Wang was agile and difficult to hit. When he had the opportunity, he would continuously strike fiercely, leaving his opponent breathless and unable to retaliate. Li Menghua's defeat was due to the strength of his opponent. Li was punched and fell in the second round. After the end of the second round, he was unable to continue the fourth round and lost. Guo Fang, the Jingwu lightweight, had the best posture, being agile, good at fighting, and possessing a deep understanding of strategy. He is a promising talent. In the fifth group, Huang Fayuan could have won. In the third round, he had a clear advantage, but he did not take advantage of his opponent's weakness to strike fiercely. As a result, he was defeated, which was a pity and due to a lack of strength. In the sixth and seventh groups, Jin Gui's victory over Hillman was rather reluctant. Jin Gui and Ha Huideng fought fiercely, but neither landed a heavy blow. Jin won by repeatedly hitting his opponent. The results of each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Weight (Pounds)  Winner  Loser</p>
<p>105  Yang Zusheng (Jingwu)  Chen Jun (Western Qing)</p>
<p>112  Su Qi (Western Qing)  Xing Yuzhang (Yueda)</p>
<p>118  Ke Li Geidu (British Army)  He Shaotang (Jingwu)</p>
<p>126  You Fang (Jingwu)  Lopafsky (Western Qing)</p>
<p>135  Krausley (Mackeiling)  Huang Fayuan (Yueda)</p>
<p>147  Jin Gui (32nd Army)  Hillman (Mackeiling)</p>
<p>160  Jin Gui (32nd Army)  Halingden (Mackeiling)</p>
<p>135  Bax (British Army)  Smith (Western Qing)</p>
<p>160  Wang Yonglan (32nd Army)  Sayer (Western Qing)</p>
<p>Heavyweight  Hui Dun (Mackeiling)  Li Menghua (32nd Army)</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Announces Elementary School Joint Sports Meet, Competition Guidelines, and Selection Rules for Callisthenics Teaching Materials</h3>
<p>The regulations for the Municipal Education Bureau's Eighth Elementary School Joint Sports Meet have been published in yesterday's newspaper. The competition guidelines, callisthenics teaching materials, organizational rules for preliminary selection meetings, and guidelines for participating in group exercises will be continued below. (Note: The previously announced Elementary School Joint Sports Meet was the Seventh, but according to the Municipal Government's intention, last year's was the Seventh District Elementary School Joint Sports Meet. This year's should still be continuously named, so it is corrected to the Eighth.)</p>
<p>Joint Sports Meet Competition Guidelines</p>
<p>Male and female track and field athletes are generally divided into two groups, A, B, and C. (For the grouping standards, see yesterday's regulations.) Male and female athletes in Group B must be re-weighed before participating in each sports competition. Male and female athletes from each district must wear spiked running shoes for Group A track and field events. All other groups must wear ordinary running shoes. If an athlete competes in one group for a certain event, they cannot move up or down to any other group for another event. If such a situation is discovered, all points earned by the athlete will be canceled. Any athlete who engages in immoral behavior will be immediately disqualified. Any athlete who engages in unethical behavior on the field will be immediately disqualified from the competition. All athletes must wear the designated number (matching the one specified on the order list) on both the chest and back. The order of each race will be determined by a draw conducted by the organizing committee. The starting position or running line for each track athlete will be determined by a draw. Athletes in each field event should attempt to jump or throw in the order determined by the organizing committee. If the number of participants in each event is too large to compete in one session, preliminary and semi-final heats should be held before the final. Athletes who have already forfeited their right to compete may not rejoin the competition. There must be at least eight athletes in the final. If this is not possible in reality, this rule does not apply. At least two athletes should be selected from each group in the preliminary and semi-final heats. Athletes participating in both field and track events must obtain permission from the field event judges before attempting to jump or throw out of the prescribed order. If a track athlete intentionally pushes or obstructs another athlete's progress, whether it occurs in the preliminary, semi-final, or final, their qualifying status will be canceled. Athletes must not use equipment or other stimulants to enhance their performance and gain an unfair advantage. If the scores of each event are the same, the tied athletes will compete again, jumping or throwing higher or further until a winner is determined. The attire of the athletes will be determined by each district, and must be clean and elegant. If athletes have any protests, they must submit them in writing within one hour of the incident, along with a deposit of five yuan, to the appeals committee for review and decision. If the appeals committee believes that the protest is without sufficient grounds, the deposit will be forfeited. The protest letter must be signed and sealed by the chairman of the athlete's district selection committee. The decision of the appeals committee on the protest letter is final and cannot be appealed further.</p>

<h3>More Than 300 Athletes for the Olympic Games Will Depart Starting Today</h3>
<p>(Daimon News Agency, Tokyo, 14th Dispatch) The total number of Japanese athletes and others participating in the Berlin Olympic Games will reach 300. The Sports Association and the International Liaison Section of the Railway Department have been working hard on this matter in recent days. Due to the number of days and expenses involved, except for the equestrian athletes, it has been decided that all will travel via Abelia with second-class treatment. The railway will transport them. The railway bureau will add trains or attach temporary trains as a gesture of goodwill to speed up the journey between Manchuria and Stulpley as much as possible. The travel expenses are roughly estimated at 640 yuan per person, but for groups of 100 or more, the price is halved. Equestrian athletes such as Major Otaki, Captain Matsui, and Lieutenant Iwahashi will depart from Yokohama on the Pozda on April 15.

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>The Siamese Government Inflicts New Harsh Regulations on Overseas Chinese Education: No Chinese Language Teaching Allowed Outside of Class; Chinese Textbooks Must Be Submitted for Review</h3>
<p>In recent years, the Siamese government's various harsh regulations to undermine overseas Chinese education have been frequently reported in Shanghai and Guangdong newspapers. Recently, the country has intensified its efforts, not only oppressing Chinese children residing in the country to study Siamese language step by step, but also prohibiting Chinese people from studying their motherland's literature outside of class time. This new regulation is scheduled to take effect on the Buddhist calendar's New Year's Day (i.e., April 1st of the Gregorian calendar). All levels of overseas Chinese schools are currently fighting for reason, but based on the failure of previous petitions, it can be concluded that this new harsh regulation is bound to be implemented. The contents of the new harsh regulation are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Since the Siamese government promulgated the so-called Compulsory Education Ordinance the year before last, all Chinese children residing in the country must study Siamese language. Although overseas Chinese compatriots unanimously opposed it at the time, they were isolated and helpless, and ultimately failed. Afterwards, the Chinese people stopped running schools one after another, or were unreasonably closed down by the Siamese government. The few remaining schools have also been changed to teach Siamese language, which is the so-called compulsory education class. Only a small number of Chinese children who exceed the age limit stipulated by the country can be taught Chinese. As for Chinese children receiving compulsory education, although there is a provision for teaching Chinese for five or six hours per week, the time is too short to be sufficient for distribution. Requests to increase the time have been denied by the Siamese government. As a last resort, each Chinese school can only hold classes in the morning and after school in the afternoon (Siamese schools usually dismiss after 3:00 PM due to the hot weather), and teach Chinese for a certain amount of time to make up for it. Unexpectedly, this method of last resort stipulates that in addition to Siamese language, required subjects such as self-cultivation, arithmetic, general knowledge, hygiene, drawing, and scouts must still use Siamese textbooks. From the first to second grades, there are five hours and twenty minutes per week for elective subjects. For the fourth and fifth grades, there are ten hours and twenty minutes per week for elective subjects (the Siamese school system graduates in five years). During this elective subject time, English, French, or Chinese can be selected. The class time is stipulated to be from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM. It is not allowed to extend the time before class or after school, and the elective textbooks (referring to Chinese textbooks) must be sent to the country's Ministry of Education for review and approval before they can be used. On the surface, this new regulation seems to be beneficial to the Chinese, because the time for teaching Chinese in the fourth and fifth grades has slightly increased compared to the past. However, in reality, it is counterproductive in terms of writing skills, because the time for teaching Chinese cannot be increased outside of class.</p>

<h3>Rejuvenating the Nation and Rescuing Homeless Children (I)</h3>
<p>— Lei Zhen</p>
<p>Broadcast Speech by the National Children's Year Implementation Committee</p>
<p>Today, I am here to discuss the issue of rejuvenating the nation and rescuing homeless children with you. Children today are the backbone of the nation's future and the masters of the country's future. Everyone knows this, so there is no need to waste words explaining it. A person's lifelong habits, personality, character, and hobbies are all developed in childhood. Therefore, for an individual, the cultivation of childhood is the foundation of one's life. For a nation and a country, children's education is the foundation of the nation's rise and fall. Since our nation and country inherited the weakness and poverty of the late Qing Dynasty, the Republic of China has been established for more than 20 years. Social order has not been stabilized, politics cannot be clarified, academic studies cannot progress, and rural areas have gone bankrupt, commerce has stagnated, and various industries have declined. The crux of this disease is certainly not a single cause, but the past neglect of children's education is indeed one of the main reasons. It must be understood that if a person develops bad habits such as selfishness, greed, laziness, and shamelessness in childhood, they will become a bad element of society when they grow up. Therefore, today's bandits, corrupt officials, and swindlers are mostly bad children of yesteryear. Therefore, to rejuvenate the nation, we must catch up in children's education with great haste.</p>
<p>Now, let us try to explore the situation of children's education in our country. According to the Ministry of Education's survey in the 21st year of the Republic of China, the number of school-age children in our country is 49,688,917. Among these more than 49 million school-age children, only 11,923,066 are in school. The number of children out of school is 37,465,851. Let us try to calculate: the number of children out of school exceeds the number of children in school by more than three times. We do not need to discuss the education situation of children in school now. What we want to discuss now is why there are so many children out of school. Based on my observations, there are roughly three reasons for children being out of school:</p>
<p>The first reason is that the supply of elementary school facilities does not meet the demand. According to the Ministry of Education's statistics in the 21st year of the Republic of China, the number of elementary schools in the country is 260,437, and they are mostly distributed in urban areas. Because elementary schools cannot accommodate all school-age children, some children are out of school because they have nowhere to study. This kind of out-of-school situation is unavoidable. Regarding this point, education is actively seeking methods, practicing compulsory education, increasing the number of elementary schools, and expanding the capacity of existing elementary schools. This year, due to the implementation of the short-term compulsory education in the National Children's Year, the number of children attending school can be increased by 4 million. It is expected that after five years, 70 to 80 percent of school-age children will have the opportunity to attend school.</p>
<p>The second reason is the stubborn mentality of children's parents. Under the conditions of the patriarchal society in the past, Chinese people considered their children to be descendants of the family and did not recognize that their children were small citizens of the country. As the saying goes, "People leave children and grass leaves roots." Therefore, parents are mostly only willing to raise their children to adulthood and do not think about teaching them to become useful citizens of the country. The children of those with property indulge in extravagant lives all year round, regardless of the adverse effects they will have on society in the future. The children of those without property are engaged in farming or hard labor with their parents and do not think about letting them go to school and become literate. There are many cases of children being out of school because of this. After the implementation of compulsory education in the future, forced enrollment will reduce the number of children out of school.</p>
<p>The third reason is the problem of homeless children that we are afraid to handle. These homeless children are the most neglected by today's society and the most harmful to future society, as they are children who are out of school and lack care. Nowadays, we can often see many beggar children in cities or towns, living like wild animals, picking coal, picking up rags, begging for leftovers, and stealing firewood. During the day, they fight by the garbage dumps, and at night, they lie down by the stoves of small shops. Some of these children are orphans without parents, and some are the children of disaster victims after rural bankruptcy. These children are generally seen as worse than pigs and dogs, and suffer the contempt and abuse of society. They do not receive the edification of knowledge, nor do they seek the skills of a profession. After growing up, they have nowhere to turn and become bandits and accomplices. In particular, because they have suffered the misfortune of humanity in their childhood, they have developed a cold and shameless mentality. Therefore, these children, after growing up, either become bandits or cruel murderers. If they become spies, they are shameless and cunning thieves. Because they have no scruples about life, they are not afraid of national law, do not fear human words, do not know morality, and do not care about integrity. Punishment is not enough to scare them, and propriety and righteousness are not enough to restrain them. From a positive perspective, we do not know how many promising talents have been buried and how many useful citizens have been abandoned among these homeless children. From a negative perspective, disrupting national security and endangering national survival are all done by these uneducated people. From this point of view, if we want to rejuvenate the nation, we must actively discuss ways to rescue homeless children.</p>
<p>Let us now try to consider the existing organizations for rescuing homeless children in our country. The only organization for rescuing homeless children now is the orphanage. According to the Ministry of Education's statistics in the 22nd year, there are six provincial and municipal orphanages in the country, 95 county and municipal orphanages, and 57 private orphanages. In total, there are only 158 orphanages in the country, accommodating only 15,772 children. Think about it, there are more than 37.4 million out-of-school children in our country. The number of homeless children among the out-of-school children is probably more than 10,000 in one city alone. In this sense, the orphanages in the country are not enough to accommodate the homeless children in one city. Such rescue is really too inadequate. Although we are actively promoting compulsory education now, compulsory education can only rescue children who are out of school. It still has no power to rescue homeless children, because compulsory education is only responsible for teaching and not responsible for care. Rescuing homeless children requires both teaching and care, and also requires finding a way out for the children when they grow up. Therefore, we must find another way to rescue homeless children.</p>

Dadecheng and Shunmao took advantage of the low price to purchase notes, rising from 1141.5 yuan to 1141.6 yuan, and the situation was uncertain.

<h3>Foreign Firms Settling Accounts, Foreign Exchange Rates Tighten Slightly Recently—Chinese Merchants Selling Forward Contracts, Rates Are Level—</h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange market saw foreign firms settling accounts, leading to very level rates. Chinese merchants were selling near-term contracts, making them tight, while forward contracts were level. Early morning saw overseas telegrams; there was some squeezing during the closure period. The London exchange rate for both near-term and forward contracts rose by .875. The New York silver market remained unchanged. The Bombay forward silver price rose by four to six percent.

Compared to before the closure, both the British pound and the U.S. dollar showed a slight tightening. After the opening, market confidence was not strong, and prices hardened slightly. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's posted rates were announced, with the British pound decreasing by .0625. Later, the rate gradually leveled out due to some settlements by foreign firms. The silver balance tax was announced, increasing by .75 compared to before the closure. Although Chinese merchants were selling, banks maintained their position. Japanese banks were selling Eastern exchange, and the market was still level at noon. Later in the day, market confidence was stable, and Chinese merchants were mostly observing. The silver market was the same, with little buying or selling. However, foreign firms continued to settle accounts, and banks began to become slightly active, but the process remained level. The two drops in Indian silver, totaling four annas, also lacked significant impact. By the close of trading, near-term selling prices were one shilling two and a half pence, and U.S. dollars were $19.875.

<h3>Long-Term Settlements Less Than 300,000, New Loans Still Not Few</h3>
<p>Today (the 15th) is the date for a large batch of long-term settlements. In principle, negotiations must be conducted in advance. The day before yesterday, they were still in the middle of negotiations, and there was no way to finalize things. Starting yesterday, the day the market reopened, everyone rushed to various departments to negotiate settlements. The overall trend is that it is difficult to recover old loans this year, and it is also not easy to issue new loans. According to our investigation, the amount of this settlement is no less than 10 million or more. Most of them require interest to be rolled over. Therefore, the amount that can actually be recovered through settlement is very small. It is also heard that creditors require debtors to repay at least two or three tenths of the principal, while requesting full collateral. By the evening, it was only discovered that 260,000 to 270,000 had been repaid. All other old long-term loans were rolled over, but the interest rate was half a yuan or one yuan higher than the previous period (the end of October last year), ranging from 8.5 yuan to 10.7 yuan, a difference of as much as 2.15 yuan. It is also heard that in the southern city, those who failed to repay amounted to more than 100,000, while new loans amounted to more than 100,000. Ningbo money shops gradually arrived in Shanghai in the past few days. The total amount of long-term loans receivable is still slightly less than 10 million. Generally, most of them are rolled over. Even if a small portion is recovered, it may not be as accommodating as the previous period and must be remitted back to Ningbo. Furthermore, although yarn factories, flour mills, and handicraft factories made a large number of new loans yesterday, the amount was about 1 million, with interest rates ranging from 8.5 yuan to 9 yuan. As for long-term deposits, such as Chengyu, Gengyu, Ankang, Anyu, and Tongyu, etc., most of them refused to accept them due to the poor market conditions and inability to transfer funds.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Bonds, Bullish Swaps, Market Prices Supported...Rising by Two to Three Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, the market conditions did not change even after a four-day holiday. There were only a few swap transactions on the floor to liven things up. In general, it still did not escape the state of stagnation. According to the investigation, most of the long positions held by various parties were confident, while the bullish side was heavily burdened and wanted to take advantage of off-exchange swaps, but it was extremely difficult to find hedging accounts. With no way to turn around, a few bullish parties used methods of manipulation to raise prices, so the market showed signs of fatigue and recovery. For example, if smuggling in the north and south is not cracked down on, tariffs will inevitably be affected. Over the course of yesterday, the closing prices generally rose slightly, ranging from five fen to two or three jiao. Numbers six and forty-eight were sold, and number thirty-seven was a bullish swap. In the secondary market, number eleven continued to pull in, seemingly afraid of missing out on opportunities, so it still recovered slightly. The situation in the morning still showed signs of weakness. In the afternoon session, number five was bought, and number eleven was important. Number fifty-six was a bullish swap, and it rose again by five fen to two and a half jiao. At the close, numbers five, ten, and twenty-three, etc., were pulled up by bullish forces, rising again by five fen to a jiao. The overall trend was that bullish forces were in control, and the market prices uniformly rose by one to two jiao. The total trading volume was 5,155,000 yuan, of which types E and C accounted for 3 million. The resulting increase and decrease are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>U.S. Stock Market's Rise and Fall Inconsistent</h3>
<p>According to the Xinfeng Foreign Firm's report on the New York stock market yesterday (the 13th), the market was extremely sluggish, and the rise and fall were very inconsistent. Buyers were very selective. The largest decline was seen in Kennecott Copper, which fell by 7.50 points. The largest increase was seen in Missouri Pacific Railroad, which rose by 13 points. Most stocks rose by a few points. Railroads and copper mines were turbulent, automobile stocks saw ups and downs, and agricultural implement stocks were flat. It is estimated that farmers' income in February increased by 17% compared to the same period last year. Steel associations estimate that steel mills are currently operating at 67.9% of capacity, 54% higher than this time last year, so steel stocks were quite stable. Small exchange stocks were quiet, the bond market was dull, and the total trading volume for the day was 1.45 million shares.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Actual Sales Not Smooth, Yarn Market Rises and Then Returns</h3>
<p>The yarn market started to rise and then fell, forming a chaotic situation. This was because gold merchants came to drag the market up forcefully, with very large amounts, but they were all concentrated in forward contracts. There were fewer near-term purchases. However, most colleagues, seeing that actual sales were not smooth and that there were no external profits, were unwilling to accept goods and leaned towards the bearish side. As a result, market prices fluctuated greatly.</p>
<p>The benchmark price fell in the near term and leveled out in the long term.</p>
<p>The opening of the benchmark yarn market in the morning saw prices increase in all months, and the situation was urgent. During this spring break, the overseas yarn market leveled out, market sentiment was good, and new sellers were not enthusiastic. Large firms came to drag the market up, and the market was dry. The peak for September was 212.10 yuan, a difference of two jiao from the peak price on December 4 of the previous year. The trend turned weak after the second session because yarn sales were not very active, and market sentiment suddenly softened and fell back. As a result, each month rose by 0.5, 0.7 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The market situation was even worse in the afternoon session, and rumors spread, favoring the bearish side. Dachangcheng still came to trade. As a result, the price this day fell by 1.20 yuan compared to the morning closing price, falling by 0.5, 0.6, 0.7 jiao. Check out the sales of Shenji 1,350 bales, Deda 850 bales, Changchang 800 bales, Hengde 600 bales, Changfeng 3,850 bales, Shengyuan 650 bales, Tonghe 750 bales, Jinghua 650 bales, and Kanjun 550 bales. Purchases were Dachangcheng 6,800 bales, Ji 600 bales, Mingde 800 bales, Geng 2,100 bales, Ren 850 bales, and Yongda 750 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for one day are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot yarn from Guangdong sells best.</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. According to the Yunzheng Daily Sales Statistics, 1,050 bales were sold, and the selling price was stable. The purchase amount for each is listed below.</p>
<p>Settlement this month on the 29th</p>
<p>The monthly benchmark standard yarn is scheduled to be settled on the 29th of this month. Trading in this month's yarn will be suspended on the 25th, 27th, 28th, and 2nd. The market will be closed for assembly on the settlement day.</p>
<h3>Bullish Side Gives Up Receiving Goods, Near-Term Cotton Presents Instability, Distant Months Also Decline</h3>
<p>The cotton market has eased recently, because the bullish side is concentrated in distant months. They are giving up receiving goods this month. The market is near low and far high. The further the distance, the more intense the pressure from cotton merchants near the month. However, the distant bullish side is still holding on tightly.</p>
<p>The near term fell by five yuan.</p>
<p>The benchmark cotton market opened in the morning, and all months turned higher. The distant rise was particularly strong. The industry merchant Dachangcheng came to buy alone again. The peak for August was 46.40 yuan, an increase of one "jiao" from the peak on December 4 of the previous year. However, Shenji and Juxing, who were long, came out together. By the third close, all months fell back. As a result, all months did not move from the previous closing price. The bullish side had no intention of receiving goods in this month's opening in the afternoon, breaking the five-yuan mark. The distant months declined in the division. Tongji sold in the morning and bought in the afternoon. Yuanxingchang and Yikang bought in the morning and sold in the afternoon. The benchmark cotton results for each month fell by 1.5 to 2.5 "jiao" compared to the morning closing price. Check the sales of Dafu 4,400 piculs, Juxing 6,000 piculs, Xingchang 2,200 piculs, Shenji 6,100 piculs, Changfeng 2,100 piculs, Runkang 2,700 piculs, Yongchang 3,300 piculs, and Yuan 1,600 piculs.

The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for one day are listed below.</p>
<p>Velvet has slightly lower transactions.</p>
<p>Cotton consumption is still dull, and factory demand is low. The source is 650 bales of Yaohua and 780 bales of Tonghua.</p>
<h3>U.S. and Indian Cotton Rise Together</h3>
<p>Yesterday's U.S. cotton was stable, and the market situation was extremely firm. Each month rose by four to seven pounds. Domestic and foreign cotton merchants and colleagues bought at limit prices in the near month. As for new cotton, because the atmosphere was not good, the Mengfei side had a big flood, and some brokers bought it. There were not many purchases. During the rise, a little bullish side closed. Currently, the weather is quite concerning. The increase in new cotton depends on the weather. Unfortunately, foreign buying expectations are limited. The market turned dull, and Hess estimated that last week's factory use was 198,000 bales. Liverpool's inventory was 341,000 bales. The close was firm, with spot goods rising by six pounds and futures rising by four to nine pounds. British cotton was closed. The Indian cotton bullish side closed, but it was overturned by the cool day and purchases by European exporters. The price of apple fruit rose by 3 to 3.25 rupees, the price of plum rose by 2.25 to 2.5 rupees, and the price of Bairuxi rose by 1.25 to 1.5 rupees. The original telegram recorded on the left (telegram from the 13th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for Bairuxi cotton for the July-August period on the 14th was 401.5 rupees, an increase of 0.75 rupees compared to the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Three Product Yarn and Cotton Rose and Fell Slightly</h3>
<p>According to the Osaka telegram on the 14th, three product futures yarn rose by one to three jiao. The near month was 196.90 yuan, and the distant month was 198.40 yuan. Cotton futures rose and fell by five fen to two jiao. The near month was 63.95 yuan, and the distant month was 61.65 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains and Flour Markets See Bullish Profit-Taking</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market showed an initial rising trend in all months after the opening in the morning, followed by a softening trend. Foreign wheat quotations saw Chicago rising by 0.1 yuan and Canada falling by 0.04 yuan. At the initial session, because of the previous day's remaining momentum, opening prices for all months were good, up to 0.5 jiao. Later, because buying was not smooth, and bullish profit-taking occurred, the near and distant markets eased slightly again, with little change in the near term compared to the initial rise, and the distant term falling by more than 0.01 yuan. At the opening of the afternoon session, because both sides were tending to wait and see, transactions became clearer, and the market fell slightly again. Both sides made few large movements in and out. The only hope is that if a good harvest can be obtained, the market will be able to become enthusiastic again.</p>
<h3>Local Gang Cashes Out, Wheat Prices Fall Back by 0.09 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the wheat futures market, the price of foreign wheat was slightly high. The weather was still good, and the industry and outside people's attitude eased. The price was slightly high by 0.02 yuan, and then followed by 0.02 or 0.03 yuan. At the opening of the afternoon session, because local customers had cash out, and the flour market was also stable, the price of each month fell by 0.02 or 0.03 yuan again. The June price fell particularly quickly because it had risen too much the day before, falling by 0.09 yuan. Such ups and downs are not surprising because the color has increased like this every year before the new wheat is launched. The spot wheat market is still stable because the arrival of wheat is not abundant. The opening mountain wheat in Yaowan is 5.33 yuan, and the Hankou wheat is 4.90 yuan, followed by 0.04 yuan, totaling 1,100 bags, which Fuxin and Fufeng will recover.</p>
<p>U.S. wheat's Taishan forecast continues dry weather in the southwest. The government estimates that the winter wheat harvest will be 493 million bushels, which is good for the bullish side. Last week's estimate of Canadian wheat supplies decreased by 995,000 bushels, and the estimate of U.S. local wheat decreased by 174,000 bushels.</p>
<h3>Passenger Xian Arrives Rarely, and Stomach Qi is Also Bland; Foreign Rice Market Atmosphere Turns Silent</h3>
<p>Yesterday's passenger xian market conditions saw weak arrivals and bland clearing. Yesterday's Zhuhu office has stopped receiving, and passenger gangs have also not inquired. Local gangs only sold 50 bags each of Guangdong and Taiwan red rice. Other sales included 1,500 bags of Gan rice, 600+ bags each of Wenzhou and Taiwan rice, and 156 bags of Anqing rice. 400 bags of Jiangbei rice were all paid for by the office on this street. Foreign rice, due to the full tax on broken rice, briefly gave people hope. However, the Zhuhu office's appetite was bland, and the excited market atmosphere also turned silent. The turning point in the future market still needs to be shifted to actual sales.</p>
<h3>Sales Still Active, Rice Market Continues Firm</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from each gang turned to prosperous, with a total of 60+ numbers arriving, totaling 14,000 shi. Although the sales market still has active offices, the appetite is dull. Only Tianjin and Qingdao offices have 1,000+ bags, so the market conditions are very different. The added-price increased by one "jiao", the early japonica increased by one "jiao", and the broken rice increased by one "jiao", those who went to Banhua increased by one jiao, and those who went to Banhua were only a few steps to Du Yangjian to imitate. Yinyuan was also beautiful.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 38 or 39 numbers from the Hena Office. The goods in the market had accumulated sales. The market price of white glutinous rice rose again by 0.05 yuan, thin rice rose by 0.1 yuan, Yangjian price rose by one jiao, and Du Bu's customer was quite active. The price rose by 0.15 yuan, Yinyuan stood firm, and Baimi moved slightly, with the price rising by nearly one jiao. The other goods were also better by one jiao.</p>
<h3>Bean Oil and Bean Cake Rebound and Fall Back</h3>
<p>The benchmark bean oil and bean cake had risen too much the day before. Although there was no telegraphic news yesterday, most people in the industry thought that the daily rise was too great, so they took advantage of the high prices to throw out, and the outside hoarders also returned with profits, with new buyers watching. As a result, the market immediately presented a rebound. In particular, the cake beans were thrown out by factories, and the decline was more severe. The closing price saw benchmark beans falling by 0.25 yuan to 0.37 yuan, benchmark cake falling by 0.06, 0.07, 0.08 yuan, and benchmark oil falling by 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Fragrant Mushrooms Plunge 20-30 Yuan, Mushrooms are also Watching the Trend</h3>
<p>With the arrival of goods from various sources in the mushroom market, customers' clearing is sluggish. In order to avoid inventory risks, the office is currently holding a slow attitude. Therefore, it is not easy to sell the goods, and the inventory on the street is gradually increasing. The weather is gradually heating up, and the office is preventing early insect damage. It is necessary to scald or bake the goods before the loss occurs. After scalding, although the goods can be stored for a long time without damage, the weight is lost. Every 100 pounds is 10 pounds short. Since the gradual cost is high, the profit is small, so those who are engaged in this business are wary. Yesterday, the selling price of good goods from Jiangxi was 195 yuan, the price of ordinary goods was 160 yuan, the price of Tunxi goods was 210 yuan to 175 yuan, the price of Fujian goods was 160 yuan for the superior and 130 yuan for the inferior. Compared with last week's market price, each grade has plunged by 20 to 30 yuan, and the speed of the migration is unexpected.</p>
<p>(Winter Mushrooms) The source is relatively rare, and there is not much inventory, so the price will not plummet. The current price of Osaka goods is 400 yuan, the price of thinner goods is 380 yuan, and the price of domestic Hua mushrooms is 380 yuan to 350 yuan. However, the price has stood at the top, and it is difficult to prevent danger at a high position. In the event of an accident, there is a downward trend.</p>
<h3>Metals: Blue Lead Market Conditions Exceptionally Firm, Short Supply of Blue Lead Iron</h3>
<p>Blue lead has recently seen active customer sales, and the sales market on this street is also becoming more prosperous, so the market is very solid, and the market is exceptionally firm, at 23.5 yuan per dan. The transaction price for future contracts is as high as 23.75 yuan.</p>
<p>The table lead iron is selling well due to the low selling price, but the arrivals are very limited, and the inventory is shallow, so there is often a situation of insufficient supply. The market price is 29.5 yuan to 30 yuan per box. Yesterday, thermos factories, cigarette factories, toy factories, etc. all transacted, reaching as many as 1300 boxes.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shanghai Silk Export Statistics for March</h3>
<p>According to the silk inspection group of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, a total of 3,110 bales of silk were exported this month. The list is as follows:</p>
<h3>Delicate Embroidery Recovers Movement in Northern Sales</h3>
<p>Recently, the sales of green tea to foreign firms are still sluggish. However, Xiumei green tea, which is delicate, is mostly replenished by the Pingjin Gang because the situation has turned slightly stable. Yesterday, tea firms such as Tongtai, Nao Li, and Laodongtai sold 1,100+ bales, and the pulling price was 10.6 yuan. The goods will be shipped out within days.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News: Large Batch of Domestically Produced Porcelain Sold to England; Buddha Statue Toys are the Main Products</h3>
<p>In recent years, the porcelain industry in Jiangxi Province has fallen sharply due to the impact of Jingdezhen porcelain. However, since this month, the English have suddenly purchased a large amount of Jiangxi porcelain. The main types of porcelain needed are Buddha statues, toys, etc. According to people in the industry, the current sales of these porcelain products have reached as much as 500,000 yuan, which is an unprecedented good sign.</p>

<p>National Products Special Issue</p>
<p>A Word of Contribution</p>
<h3>Cooperation between the National Products Industry and the Political World</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Yesterday, the China National Industry and Foreign Trade Association and the China National Products Production and Marketing Cooperation Association hosted a public banquet at the Bank Club for Mr. Wu Daquan, Minister of Industry. In addition to the factory inspection specialists from the Executive Yuan, the attendees were also leading figures in Shanghai's industrial sector and powerful members engaged in the national products business. The administrative and industrial/commercial sectors gathered together to express their opinions on improving industry and to address the hardships of factories. It was like a family reunion, direct and without secrets, which seemed to foster a sense of camaraderie and represented a situation unseen for over a decade. Mr. Wu stated that he greatly admired the fact that various factories were able to seek progress on their own under the circumstances of foreign goods dumping and a sluggish market. He noted that all of their products were improving with each passing day, demonstrating the potential to surpass foreign-made goods. However, he also noted that in the development of business, it is better to rely on one's own strength rather than depend on others. The national products industry should strive for self-reliance, improve itself, and seek excellence, so that domestic goods will naturally be used and enjoyed by the people. There is no need to force or persuade people to do so. Currently, the national products industry should avoid engaging in meaningless competition or producing substandard goods to devalue national products. Instead, it should focus on improving technology, lowering costs, and improving efficiency. The driving force behind encouraging the people to love national products lies within the national products industry itself. How to achieve production and marketing cooperation to extend to the entire nation and abroad also lies within the industrial sector itself. China's mechanical industry is still in its infancy. It may be beneficial to adopt the transitional method of "welcoming foreign goods for production tools, while using domestically produced goods for consumer items." In the future, self-sufficiency will rely even more on the efforts of the national products industry. During the banquet, the industrial sector representatives expressed the hope that the raw material tax would be refunded to demonstrate encouragement. They also stated that trade association organizations should be strengthened without compromise. The establishment of industries in various provinces should be coordinated to consider the overall situation, to have a comprehensive plan, to avoid duplication and prevent partiality. They concluded by emphasizing the need to exchange opinions and coordinate with each other at any time, and that discussions of certain issues could be conducted with government officials to mutually express opinions and to eliminate past misunderstandings and meaningless bureaucracy. This spirit of unity between government and people portends unlimited hope for the national products industry. Since taking office as minister, Mr. Wu has worked hard to support the national products industry by establishing commercial officials abroad, organizing the Agricultural Foundation Bureau, and sending personnel to investigate local industries. He has provided convenience for the development of China's industry in every way. In the future, there will be many more opportunities for administrative and industrial sectors to work together. This inaugural gathering promises to fulfill many aspirations and to serve as a test for future development.</p>

<p>Self-Treatment for Leukorrhea, Qiao Wenbin. This condition is generally caused by inflammation of the uterus. The treatment should emphasize both internal and external approaches. Internal medication using female gonad preparations that strengthen the uterus and reduce inflammation is the most effective. For external use, a combined product of lactic acid bacteria vaginal suppositories and liver starch is best.</p>
<p>(Letter from Mrs. David Crane states) Illness is unavoidable for humans, and medicine is indispensable for the sick. However, if we women suffer from hidden ailments, seeking medical help is inconvenient, let alone taking medicine. For example, my close relative, Mrs. Song, has suffered from leukorrhea for years, keeping it a secret and delaying treatment, leading to physical weakness and menstrual irregularities. Fortunately, after reading this publication, she learned that she could take "Female Gonad Extract" internally and use "Leukorrhea Relief" externally. She immediately purchased them from the nearby Wuzhou Pharmacy and used them both internally and externally according to instructions. The leukorrhea cleared up, her menstruation became regular, and her body quickly regained strength and health. Her breasts even developed, and happiness returned to her marriage as if it were her honeymoon.</p>
<p>Treatment for Tinnitus and Dizziness, Jia Zhizhong. Neurasthenia, when it reaches the point of brain neurasthenia, is at its most severe. Its external symptoms include tinnitus, dizziness, blurred vision, insomnia, forgetfulness, frequent dreams, palpitations, etc. The cause lies in the lack of endocrine secretions from the gonads. Therefore, the fundamental cure is best achieved with gonad preparations, which ordinary preparations cannot match.</p>
<p>The patient, Yu Yuting, had long suffered from brain weakness, forgetfulness, and insomnia, causing him great distress. Last autumn, due to tinnitus, dizziness, palpitations, and frequent dreams, he sought treatment from me. I instructed him to purchase and take "Gonad Extract" from Zhengwei Pharmacy. After taking it, his mind felt clear and strong, his ears and eyes were sharp, his heart was calm, and he slept soundly. He also regained his memory and recovered his health. In short, the treatment took less than a month.</p>

<h3>Case Records of Venereal Disease Treatment, Dr. Zhan Nian Zeng. (Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road.</h3>
<p>(1) Comprehensive Care During Smoking Cessation Treats Stomach Pain and Indigestion. Treats Seminal Emission and Insomnia. Safe Smoking Cessation.</p>
<p>Patient Shen Yinong, from Yixing, 41 years old, worker. (Chief Complaint) - Painful smoking cessation. Repeated attempts have failed to completely quit. Accompanied by stomach problems, indigestion, seminal emission, and insomnia. (Medical History) - Mr. Shen has been addicted to smoking for 17 years, starting to alleviate stomach pain. However, once addicted, the pain not only remained but also worsened. He repeatedly tried to quit, but stopped midway due to mental anguish and frequent seminal emissions and insomnia. Last autumn, after seeing his close friend safely quit smoking with my help, he asked to be introduced to me for treatment. (Treatment) - I instructed him to purchase and take "Reproductive Industry" from Huamei Pharmacy for safe smoking cessation, and supplemented it with "Hemit's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to treat his seminal emission. "Stomach Pain Relief" was prescribed to treat his kidney pain, and "Stomach-Strengthening Essence" to stimulate his appetite. He achieved the same complete success as his close friend.</p>
<p>(2) Premature Ejaculation, Kidney Weakness, Seminal Emission, and Nocturnal Emission. Venereal disease persists, symptoms worsen. Renowned drugs are used for treatment, and recovery is swift.</p>
<p>Patient Zhuo Qingji, from Hefei, 38 years old, businessman. (Chief Complaint) - Seminal emission, nocturnal emission, kidney weakness, premature ejaculation. (Medical History) - Mr. Zhuo committed masturbation in his youth, leading to seminal emission. He married too early and also suffered from premature ejaculation. Excessive sexual activity led to kidney weakness. Delaying treatment worsened the condition. He lost vitality and interest, and suffered from various ailments, both physically and mentally. Last autumn, he was introduced to me by his colleague, Mr. Du. (Treatment) - In addition to performing the latest scientific surgery, painless wave therapy, I also prescribed "Hemit's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" and "Gonad Extract" because Mr. Zhuo's seminal gate was loose and his gonads were declining. Mr. Zhuo was instructed to purchase and take them from Sino-Western Pharmacy. After taking them, his sperm was consolidated and his ejaculation was cured. His chronic illness quickly disappeared. In total, the treatment took 27 days.</p>

(Medical History) - Mr. Gu is a traveling representative for a certain industry, traveling throughout the country and working hard. He first suffered from lower back pain and rheumatism. Due to delayed treatment, he developed kidney deficiency and back pain, as well as numbness in his limbs. Repeated medications were ineffective. He was introduced to me by Mr. Zhou Huyong last winter. (Treatment) - After diagnosing that Mr. Gu suffered from neurasthenia, I also found that he had residual toxins that had not been cleared, causing pain in his bones. I immediately instructed him to take the famous medicine "Strong's Bone Pain Tablets" and "Gonad Extract" from the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company to remove the residual toxins and replenish his deficiencies. His bones and joints felt comfortable, his hands and feet were flexible, his qi and blood became vigorous, and his lower back felt light and strong, as if he were a lively dragon and tiger.</p>

She suffers from the symptoms described above. Delayed treatment has worsened her condition. Repeated tonics have had superficial effects. She was introduced to me by Mrs. Tang Xiji last winter. (Treatment) - I diagnosed that the root of Mrs. Ji's illness lies in the atrophy of her gonads, which other medications cannot treat. I immediately instructed her to purchase and take "Female Gonad Extract" from China-British Pharmacy to regulate menstruation, strengthen the uterus, reduce inflammation, and treat leukorrhea. For rapid treatment, I prescribed the external use of "Leukorrhea Cloud." After a month, all symptoms disappeared, and her breasts developed and became shapely, giving her the figure a young woman should have.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement - Idle Talk - Hunan Plans to Establish a Prostitute School by Jiawei. This may be a commendable thing. Our society today is indeed in constant "construction" and "improvement"! Isn't that right? What "economic construction," "aviation construction," "national defense construction," "XX construction," and even "thrift movement," "mother education movement," "local goods movement," "XX movement"..., many, many grandly said to be "planning" to reform today's society and country through "construction" and "movement"!</p>
<p>Indeed, although we haven't clearly seen the effects and results of these examples, under the authorities' "painstaking" advocacy and promotion, perhaps they can temporarily give people some excitement and stimulation?</p>
<p>In today's newspaper, we found another example. According to reports - Hunan Provincial Games Association plans to open a prostitute school, planning to accommodate 500 people. They will be taught embroidery, sewing, and various handicrafts, as well as practical subjects such as Mandarin and abacus. Registration will be carried out first. After registration, the prostitutes will take an exam, and based on the exam results, they will be divided into classes for training according to their level. The graduation period is at most two years and at least one year; the daily course is six hours, just like a regular school. After one class graduates, those who register later will be enrolled for training. It is said that this plan is currently being prepared and is expected to be realized in the autumn of this year.</p>
<p>Originally, we still remember that not long ago, prostitutes and dancers wanted to enter school but could not find a way; even more so, children whose mothers sold their bodies for a living were rejected by the school authorities. Their reason was: because they wanted to prevent the corruption of other "good family children," and were even more afraid of affecting the school's reputation. However, whether these "reasons" have a factual basis is still questionable; but here it fully reflects the morbidity of our old society and the social psychology of some people! Therefore, today, in Hunan, the establishment of a school dedicated to educating prostitutes who have been discriminated against and abandoned is undoubtedly a somewhat satisfactory thing!</p>
<p>However, what we have seen in the past from various local authorities, so-called "abolition of prostitution," "prohibition of prostitution," and even "public prostitution," etc., those disguised taxation methods of "imposing taxes in the name of prohibition" are, on the contrary, increasing the burden and suffering of prostitutes, and never finding a correct way out!</p>
<p>Therefore, today's Hunan authorities' "prostitute school" can indeed be said to be a new face in the sound of "abolition of prostitution"!</p>
<p>However, we have to say it again, under such a method of "not eradicating the roots," under the current environment, can we receive its expected effects?</p>
<p>Carpenter's Son by Yan A pretentious act that made his companions laugh. Although Little Flower's dad's face turned red, he was extremely happy in his heart: Little Flower will graduate in another year!</p>
<p>Little Flower is really too smart and hardworking. It seems that he was born with something more than his classmates. Even extracurricular questions, he can answer them all. When he gets home, he always does his homework at his small desk, waiting for his dad to come back to eat dinner together. But today, when Dad came back, he didn't see Little Flower. He asked Mom, who said he came home early. This house, besides the front door facing the street, has a back door leading to the riverbank. But Dad opened the back door and called Little Flower's name, but no one answered. The sky was about to turn completely dark, and there was still some light reflecting from the river. Dad turned on his flashlight and looked around. There was a dark shadow sitting under the roots of a tree by the river, wearing a glorious uniform, the uniform of the county elementary school! So the carpenter dad ran over. When he picked up his son, he saw clear tears welling up in his son's eyes. This had never happened before. His son had told stories from books, saying that people shouldn't cry, and that no matter what difficulties they faced, they should cheer up and do it. So, why was this storytelling elementary school student crying?</p>
<p>Dad and Mom used many kind words to question their son. The son told the following:</p>
<p>A classmate lost a fountain pen. When the monitor came to check the classroom, the pen was found in my drawer. They all made faces and called me a thief. The principal took me to the teaching office and questioned me. I really didn't steal it. I don't know where the pen came from. The principal wants Dad to go to school with me tomorrow...</p>
<p>The carpenter dad jumped up. He knew his son would never steal anything. He wanted to go to the school immediately to question the principal. His son was going to graduate in another year! A graduate of a county elementary school is such a noble thing!</p>
<p>But he immediately remembered the story his son had told, that no matter what difficulties you face, you must cheer up and do it, and that people shouldn't cry! So he sat down again and patted his son's shoulder, asking in a low voice, "Tell Dad, did you really not steal that fountain pen?"</p>
<p>The son widened his eyes and stared at Dad, not understanding why Dad didn't believe his words.</p>
<p>Over there, under the light of the kerosene lamp, Mom's face was reflected, her eyebrows furrowed, biting her lower lip. Did she also suspect her son of being a thief?</p>
<p>The carpenter's son, Little Flower, burst into tears...</p>
<p>(End)</p>
<p>That terrible demon is here again! Chun Nian's Murderous Demon! Exorcism</p>
<p>In the picture above, there is a demon with lustful eyes and a huge open mouth, looking very scary.</p>
<p>This demon is like a germ carrying the plague. Plague germs kill tens of millions of people every year, and their bodies are extremely small, invisible to the human eye, so their harm is actually more severe than the monster in the picture!</p>
<p>Now this terrible monster (plague) is here again. If we can pay attention to prevention, we can also kill this monster. That is to use "Yalin Disinfectant Water" (produced by Wuzhou Pharmacy) to sprinkle and disinfect everywhere, killing germs and making them unable to parasitize. Then the source of the disease will be eliminated, and the disease will naturally be avoided. This is the simplest and most effective method of defense.</p>
<p>Drunk by Muye. It was late at night, and the customers in this small restaurant gradually dispersed in the flickering lamplight. The young and beautiful proprietress still had a charming smile on her face, laughing with a silver-bell-like voice, saying goodbye to each customer affectionately, calling out, "Come early tomorrow, eh..." Then she took the counted money and threw it into the bamboo tube money box with a "Guanglang" sound. Then she turned around to another...</p>
<p>The customers gradually dispersed, and in the end, only Li Dakui was left.</p>
<p>He was always the last to leave, he drank the most, and he drank at least half a catty of the strongest liquor. Was he a big drinker? No, he got drunk more easily than anyone else! Sometimes he was so drunk that he was completely unconscious, just like a pile of mud. He was a one-eyed officer who often told people about how he killed thirteen people in one go on the front line. That eye was shot out by a bullet from an ambush. He had a very hot temper, and causing trouble was common. Look, other tables could seat seven or eight people or more, but his table only had one person, and everyone else kept their distance. Sometimes he would say, "Come to my table, everyone, let's talk. What are you afraid of? I'm not a man-eating tiger." But no one dared to take the risk. If someone really sat down, he would turn his face and shout loudly, "Get out of here, I'm going to chop you, see if you're afraid..." As a result, people had to smile apologetically and walk away.</p>
<p>The proprietress had no choice but to deal with him. She found this customer particularly difficult to handle. If he lost his temper, smashed things, and drove away other customers, it would naturally be an uncompensated loss. However, every time he paid the bill, he would always grab a handful of money or banknotes in a daze. (Several times more than what he consumed.) The proprietress would silently and happily accept it.</p>
<p>He was already drunk, mumbling incomprehensible words. He shook his powerless head, which had been burned red by the liquor, his eye squinting into a line, without any light, and the muscles on his face were relaxed. He was smiling inexplicably. He muttered, "Hey... little sister-in-law... you... you... huh!"... He suddenly burst out laughing, that laughter was so strange that it seemed like a cry, so miserable. His broad chest and shoulders shook with laughter, and he comically stuck out his tongue, making all sorts of ugly and grotesque faces.</p>
<p>The shop assistants all laughed, looking at Li Dakui, then at the proprietress, and then focusing their attention on Li Dakui again.</p>
<p>"Oh my god! He's drunk again..." The proprietress seemed to be complaining to someone, and she raised her voice to Li Dakui, "It's getting late, go back quickly. What time is it, still not leaving, really..." (To be continued)</p>
<p>Feature - The Completion Ceremony of the Third Dock at the Jiangnan Shipyard by Yu. Yesterday afternoon, the weather was strangely gloomy, as if it was about to rain.</p>
<p>Many men and women in tattered clothes mixed in with the blue-cloth and gray-clothed workers'队伍, running into the tall gate of the "Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy" with smiles: "The warship entering the dock today is very big!"</p>
<p>Perhaps they all lived near the shipyard and often went there to play, and ran very familiarly into the third dock.</p>
<p>Soon, these people who ran in thickened the line surrounding the dock, and the navy stood in front of them, blocking their advance.</p>
<p>The third dock was indeed very large, looking like a small lake. At both ends of the dock were two bridges, and the pontoon bridge near the Huangpu River was also a gate. The edges of the dock were steel plates, and the body was made of wood, trapezoidal in shape. They were all coated with black asphalt, perhaps not long ago, because the asphalt smell was still so strong.</p>
<p>Page 18</p>
<p>Bright national flags were hung around the dock. In the space in the middle of the dock, three red, white, and blue silk ribbons were hung horizontally with three tricolor red, white, and blue彩球s.</p>
<p>The pumping station was on the right side of the gate. There were five winches installed on both sides of the dock.</p>
<p>The stage, temporarily set up on the bridge inside, was very simple, with a portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and two vases.</p>
<p>Gradually, a dozen or so naval officers gathered next to the stage. Their uniforms were all very smart, and the yellow handles of their command swords were held in white gloves, making them look even more majestic. Their hands frequently touched the brims of their hats.</p>
<p>At that moment, the gate, which was as high as the horizon, gradually floated up from under the water, rising four or five feet above the ground. Two iron cables secured the gate, and under the traction of two winches, the gate left its original position and leaned against the bank outside the gate in the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>A gasoline boat began to sail towards the Ninghai warship not far from the dock.</p>
<p>Here, the navy bugle next to the stage blew "lala", and the officers formed a team to the bridge and saluted according to the ritual.</p>
<p>The song was sung loudly and neatly by a team of elementary school students in blue cloth uniforms.</p>
<p>The workers in the dock also began to work, pushing the wood stacked next to the dock one by one into the water. They floated on木排s, using brooms as oars, working in the dock.</p>
<p>The small gasoline boat towed the "ceremonial ship entering the dock" Ninghai over. Some officers in neat uniforms stood on the bow of the ship. Closer, I saw that in addition to the officers and navy on the bow of the ship, there were also seven or eight ladies, one of whom was standing in the middle, wearing a white silk披肩, a white silk旗袍, and white leather shoes; holding a bouquet of鲜花 in her hand. Without anyone telling me, everyone knew that she was Miss Ma Mingye, who was there for the ribbon-cutting ceremony.</p>
<p>As the bow of the ship entered the dock entrance, the small and large边砲s next to the dock burst out with a rattling sound. Amidst the military music, the people watching on both sides were hit by碎边砲纸 falling from the sky, like a bride and groom.</p>
<p>The bow of the ship was about to touch the彩球s. The captain standing next to Miss Ma stretched out his hand and grabbed the彩球s. Miss Ma quickly cut the彩带 with the scissors in her white-gloved hand. The彩带 fell to both sides, and the彩球s fell onto the ship.</p>
<p>Miss Ma's brown face showed a hint of a smile, allowing several camera lenses to capture her smile from under the ship.</p>
<p>The Ninghai warship was towed by the iron cables on the winches on both sides, swaying into the dock. As the iron cables passed, the people on both sides were driven to the back. The foreman held a microphone and shouting, "Hurry up! Slow down!" to direct the workers.</p>
<p>In this way, the ship sailed until it was more than ten feet away from the bridge before it was settled. Miss Ma, the captain, and other officials standing on the bow of the ship retreated, and the officers on the bridge also retreated under the sound of military号s.</p>
<p>After having tea and snacks in the office, the expansion project of the third dock of the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy was completed at this time.</p>
<p>According to the news released by the shipyard: The shipyard originally had two dry docks, one over five hundred feet long and one over four hundred feet long, which could repair and build a large number of medium-sized warships and merchant ships of about 10,000 tons. After the expansion project of the third dock, the length is over six hundred and forty feet, the width is one hundred feet, and the depth is twenty-six feet. In the future, large ships from various countries coming to Shanghai can easily enter the dock for inspection.</p>
<p>On the way back, the rain was falling like tears again.</p>

<p>Poor family, bare bones, simple prodigy. Reflecting snow, gathering fireflies, always working hard. Brothers died early, parents gone. Nowhere to live, living in a broken kiln. Difficult to make ends meet, not complaining about poverty. Suddenly, I heard the sound of people outside the door. Farewell to a beautiful woman, a peerless face. Servants and maids leave in a hurry. The scholar was frightened and at a loss. Chang'e should be in the Guanghan Palace. Often bowing and asking carefully. The unlucky father is Ma Rong. Hidden in the brothel, named Yao Cao. Diligent needlework year after year. Wanting to offer herself to the treacherous Prime Minister Liang's mansion. Determined to disobey fate, not following suit. How can she be the same as an unfilial person. Intending to marry a poor scholar. Burdening a talented and concise prime minister. If you don't mind my ugly appearance. I don't mind the hardships and high winds. Willing to cook and be a maid. Why not study with me until the fifth watch. Otherwise, bury my body in the ditch. Afraid of falling into the Avici Hell, the eighteenth level. I will not let down my lord in the rest of my life.</p>

<p>Movie News</p>
<p>Lianhua's First Sound Film "Waves Washing Sand" to be Released Soon Lianhua's first film. Lianhua Company has been established for several years, and the films it has produced have been welcomed by audiences at home and abroad. However, all of its products have always been silent films with配击. Recently, in order to keep up with the trend, it has specialized in producing dialogue sound films. After a year of preparation, it is finally being released. "Waves Washing Sand" is its first product. Of course, this Lianhua's first sound film, which has been called for a thousand times, is indeed worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>Opening up new themes. Chinese film themes are obviously becoming increasingly constrained due to various influences. Under this circumstance, "Waves Washing Sand" can be said to be a film that opens up new themes.</p>
<p>The front of the script reads:</p>
<p>"A kind person will commit a crime in an accidental unfortunate encounter; a law-abiding detective is forever pursuing the criminals they want to arrest. When these two people stand on the same line of life, they will abandon their hostility and become the highest form of friendship; but once they encounter a conflict of interest and the agitation of human desires, they will immediately restore their hostility. This kind of tragedy is forever produced between people."</p>
<p>Just from reading those few preface sentences, we can know that this is a new type of影剧.</p>
<p>The sad and tragic poem "Waves Washing Sand" is extremely poetic. After watching this film, we seem to be immersed in the realm of poetry, but this poem is not a fantasy, but a very practical and tragic poem.</p>
<p>Human blood records. Human history is written in blood, but there is originally no hatred between people, only because they need to survive, cannot understand each other, and forever plunder, kill, and wage war against each other. This "Waves Washing Sand" can be said to be a microcosm of the human world, and can also be said to be a record of human blood.</p>
<p>Lai Fu Bailaimei and Ge Lulixiya co-star in "Business Warfare Inside Story"</p>
<p>Human Shanghai Reflects</p>
<p>Emphasizing psychological depiction. "Waves Washing Sand" not only has a transcendent meaning in its theme, but also has a special success in its depiction. As a whole, it starts from the psychology of human beings and writes a tragedy that contains infinite philosophical meaning, which can make every viewer have a personal spiritual touch.</p>
<p>Exterior scenes taken from Qingdao. A quarter of the entire film is set against the background of a beach and a lonely island, which was taken from Qingdao. The sea and sky are the same color, the scenery is natural, and the raging waves are majestic. Dao Jue "The harvest of "Waves Washing Sand" in terms of exterior scenery can be said to be extremely satisfactory.</p>
<p>Interior scenes can be arranged. 布景师, Xu Ke, is a new and excellent talent. The setting of "Little Angel" was made by him. This is his second collaboration with the film director Wu Yonggang. Xu Jun's setting, simple money rules, has a unique style. The excellent achievement of the setting in this "Waves Washing Sand" is enough to放 one outstanding color in Chinese film settings.</p>
<p>Photography and sound recording are excellent. The photography of "Waves Washing Sand" is handled by photographers Hong Weilie and Zhou Damin. They have achieved amazing success in配光. The sound recording is by Kuang Zan. Because this is Lianhua's first sound film, they are meticulous and naturally have excellent results. In the past and present domestic sound films, the light is clear and soft, and the sound is clear and loud. In terms of vision and hearing, this can be considered a relatively satisfactory sound film.</p>
<p>Jin Yan and Zhang Zhizhi. "Waves Washing Sand" is not only Lianhua's first sound film, but also Jin Yan's first sound masterpiece in Lianhua. Watching Jin Yan's amazing acting skills in this film, it is not an exaggeration to say that it is the greatest success he has seen in the past three years. And Zhang Zhizhi has taken a step further on the ladder in "Goddess". Partnering with Jin Yan in this play can be called a perfect combination.</p>
<p>Director Wu Yonggang. The director of this film is Wu Yonggang. Wu Yonggang became famous with the film "Goddess", and then made the film "Little Angel", which was especially praised by those who are enthusiastic about film education. "Waves Washing Sand" is his third work, and the good results are naturally expected.</p>
<p>This film will be released soon. As it has been discussed with film people across the country, this film has been scheduled to be released in Shanghai and other parts of the country in the coming days</p>
<h3>Regarding Understanding Domestically Produced Airplanes</h3>
<p>— Meng</p>
<p>I was just delighted by the new record of trade surpluses for external trade in December of last year and January of this year! However, the Jianghai Customs announced that Shanghai's external trade exports decreased and imports increased in February, reversing to a deficit, with a deficit amount of 1,777,391 yuan. In that case, what is the use of the December surplus of 1,080,000 yuan and the January surplus of 1,392,073 yuan in the 25th year of the Republic? The people of the nation should redouble their efforts to promote and use domestic goods, and understand them more fully, so that it will be possible to achieve monthly trade surpluses. Therefore, I find it extremely commendable that the Chinese Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Department has been able to use domestic materials to manufacture a self-made biplane seaplane/amphibious aircraft! According to reports, "This aircraft is intended for flight training, so in addition to the pilot, it can also seat one person. Except for the engine, which was purchased from the United States, all the hardware, enamel, fir, canvas, and all miscellaneous items are domestic products."</p>
<p>We know that saving the nation with domestic goods and saving the nation with aviation are equally important. Recognizing the interest in aviation, it is even more important to recognize the interest in promoting domestic goods. "We have a domestic airplane!" Everyone can clap and cheer, shouting resounding slogans!</p>
<h3>Dr. Lü Miannan of Nanjing Successfully Researches and Refines Gasoline</h3>
<p>— Shou</p>
<p>Each Ton of Coal Can Refine Ten Gallons; Other Byproducts Are Also Numerous</p>
<p>In the past few decades, all of China's industries have developed extraordinarily, especially the automobile and aviation industries, which have made rapid progress. This is naturally something that we find gratifying. But in everything, we must observe carefully. The growing development of the automobile and aviation industries is, of course, a good phenomenon. But on the other hand, we must consider where the essential commodity used by automobiles and airplanes—gasoline—comes from? Anyone with even a little common sense knows that our country does not produce gasoline. Therefore, the gasoline we currently use is supplied by countries such as England, America, and Russia. In the past, the outflow of gasoline was not so alarming, but since the development of the automobile and airplane industries, the import of gasoline has been staggering. According to past newspaper reports, the annual outflow of gasoline is always several tens of millions of yuan. Even in the year of promoting domestic goods, the amount of gasoline imported is still increasing daily, because cars and airplanes cannot run without gasoline as fuel, and there is no domestic substitute besides relying on foreign goods. So, we have no choice but to use foreign goods with a painful heart!</p>
<p>It is said that the raw material for gasoline is refined from coal. The production of coal is very abundant in our country, especially in Shanxi Province, where coal mines are everywhere. If the Chinese people can refine it, then there will be no shortage of this raw material, coal. Not only can we be self-sufficient, but we may even be able to supply foreign countries! Unfortunately, most people have not paid attention to this point, and foreign gasoline continues to be imported, which is such a heartbreaking thing!</p>
<p>Dr. Lü Miannan, the director of the Chemical Laboratory of the Capital Construction Committee, is a person with a purpose. He has been paying attention to this for several years. After several years of research, he has made considerable achievements in refining gasoline—one might even say a considerable success. The raw material he uses to refine gasoline is bituminous coal. He has refined bituminous coal from various places, and the best is the bituminous coal produced in Leping County, Jiangxi. There are roughly two refining methods: the first is low-temperature distillation, but each ton of coal (1,680 catties) can only refine ten gallons of gasoline, although there are many byproducts, such as coking coal, asphalt, and phenol. The second is light refining: each ton of coal can refine a lot of oil, but there are no byproducts. Comparing the two, low-temperature distillation is more cost-effective, so the first method is still used. He has already refined a considerable amount, and the results are very good.</p>
<p>It is said that when refining gasoline from bituminous coal, there are several separations. The first is called light oil, which is used to make gasoline. The second is called middle oil; the third is called heavy oil. Middle oil and heavy oil cannot be refined into gasoline, but they can be refined into kerosene (i.e., lamp oil) and machine oil. The last is oil residue, which can be made into asphalt and paraffin, and phenol can also be used to make bakelite appliances. So, this kind of oil refining is very cost-effective.</p>
<p>Their refining of gasoline can be considered a success! The second step should naturally be to set up a factory to manufacture it. However, capital is also a problem. The minimum requirement is probably more than one million yuan. They are planning to apply to the Ministry of Industry for a patent at a suitable time! We hope that their plan to set up a factory for manufacturing can be realized soon.</p>
<p>Regarding the refining procedures, due to space limitations, I will report on them when there is an opportunity!</p>
<h3>The Necessity of Organizing Children's Domestic Goods Consumption Groups</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>Children's awareness is naive, and their experience is weak. It is easy for them to be taken advantage of in everything. Take the example of children buying things. They are often deceived into buying many foreign goods by unscrupulous merchants who use sweet talk, because children only care about whether the goods look good, and they mostly ignore whether the source of the goods is domestic or foreign. In fact, it is not surprising that they do so. Who in school or at home often points out the differences between domestic and foreign goods? What they hear from adults is only abstract terms such as "use domestic goods" and "don't buy foreign goods." Therefore, in the future, if we want children to truly take the step of not buying foreign goods and using domestic goods, then it is necessary to actively organize children's domestic goods consumption groups.</p>
<p>A children's domestic goods consumption group is a way for children to encourage each other, supervise each other, and take the step of not buying foreign goods and using domestic goods. The group can also elect five or seven members to form a committee, so that everyone can take responsibility for this type of work. As for how not to buy foreign goods? How to use domestic goods? How to distinguish between foreign and domestic goods? How to deal with children who buy foreign goods? How to check what children buy? And other messy and urgent problems, naturally they (the children) will jointly discuss good methods in meetings. Teachers only stand in the position of guidance, instructing children on all common knowledge related to domestic goods and methods of using domestic goods.</p>
<p>In short, if children's domestic goods consumption groups can be organized everywhere, the observation power of children's understanding of domestic and foreign goods can definitely be greatly enhanced, and everyone will definitely be able to develop the habit of using domestic goods. It will definitely be of great benefit to the future of domestic goods. I sincerely hope that the teachers in various places who are responsible for educating children will quickly instruct the children to organize children's domestic goods consumption groups.</p>

<h3>Weakness - Consumption</h3>
<p>— Yu Bofu</p>
<p>Consumption is a disease that affects the most patients, with varying degrees of severity. Those with physical weakness are most susceptible to it. This is because the ability of weak people to resist disease is very weak. Pathogens are easily infected and cause rapid and severe harm. Therefore, those with physical weakness should quickly seek ways to restore their health.</p>
<p>The symptoms of weakness are diverse and inconsistent, mostly due to the lack of endocrine in the gonads, leading to neurasthenia. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment is to use gonad preparations. This will nourish the nerves, strengthen the blood, replenish the essence, and strengthen the body. Moreover, those with vigorous gonadal endocrine not only have vigorous vitality, but also have extremely strong resistance to disease.</p>
<p>Men should take "Male Gonad Extract."</p>
<p>Women should take "Female Gonad Extract."</p>
<h3>Seminal Emission - Premature Ejaculation - Kidney Weakness</h3>
<p>— Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>The Three Major "Sexual Neurasthenia Syndromes"!</p>
<p>Masturbation is an evil habit that young people are most prone to. Therefore, seminal emission has become a common disease among young people. If marriage is too early, it will cause premature ejaculation. If sexual activity is excessive, it will easily lead to kidney weakness. There are also those who suffer from the above three major sexual diseases at a young age due to excessive masturbation or weak constitution. This is all because the gonads are destroyed, vitality is lost, sexual nerves are weakened, and sexual performance becomes sluggish.</p>
<p>The treatment of sexual diseases, if combined with electrotherapy by a famous venereal disease expert, can speed up the treatment period. If you take famous medicines internally for self-treatment, the following two famous medicines are the most effective.</p>
<p>"Ximitos Solidifying Essence Tablets" Treat seminal emission, solidify the seminal gate. Swallow three tablets before going to bed.</p>
<p>"Germinal Essence" Treats sexual diseases, restores vitality. Three tablets each time, three times a day.</p>
<p>Or follow the doctor's instructions.</p>
<p>(Note) The famous venereal disease expert Dr. Zhan Nianzeng is equipped with the latest electrotherapy equipment. He is not only good at treating the above three major sexual diseases, but also an old hand in treating new and old leukorrhea and phimosis. Therefore, I am happy to introduce him.</p>
<h3>Stomach Pain, Bone Pain, Quitting Smoking Example</h3>
<p>(Report by Medical Instructor Wang Shiying) Last autumn, Mr. Hu Lancai from Nanchang came to complain about stomach pain and bone pain and sought help in quitting opium. He claimed to have tried to quit repeatedly, but the pain always made it difficult to complete. (Omission) I immediately instructed him to purchase and take "Stomach Pain Relief" from a Chinese and Western pharmacy to treat his stomach pain, and "Gastric Strengthening Element" to strengthen his weak stomach. He took "Johnston's Bone Pain Tablets" to treat his bone pain. The pain was completely relieved, and the disease was completely cured. Then he took "Germinal Essence" to remove the opium poison and restore his health. Within a month, he safely quit smoking and achieved a satisfactory result.</p>
