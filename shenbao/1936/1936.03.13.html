<p>— 中國科學社主編　杏邨</p>
<p>昆蟲的生殖和發生（上）</p>
<p>昆蟲的種數佔動物界全體百分之七十以上，他們非但種數極多，卽每種中所有個體的數目有時也很足驚人，因此，昆蟲在在和人類發生利害衝突，蝗蟲螟蟲爲害我國農作物，每年動至若千萬萬元的損失，想來大家已經很熟聽的了昆蟲的生殖和發生情形，不獨爲學農的人所當了解，卽一般愛好自然的人，也定樂於一聽，因爲這是一個富有興趣的問題，我所以着手寫這篇文字的動機，便在這兩點上。</p>
<p>昆蟲生殖的方法就昆蟲的生殖能力講，有的能生殖，例如，蝗蟲及其他大多數昆蟲，有的不能生殖，例如，在白蟻羣裏，只有后蟻才具有產卵能力，通常兵蟻和后蟻是不能生殖的。就受精與吾來講，有的行兩性生殖，卽雌雄交配受精後，產卵蕃殖，大多數俱是如此的，有的行孤雌生殖，卽雌體無須和雄體交配受精，也可產生後代，例如，蚜蟲（但蚜蟲也非絕對行孤雌生殖，在一年中之某一時期，也要交配受精的。）和蜜蜂。（后蜂所產的受精卵，將來發育成雌蜂，未受精卵，將來發育成雄蜂。）就後代出母體時的形態講，有卵生和胎生的區別，所謂卵生，卽當子代離開母體時，仍爲卵期，將來在外界孵化爲幼蟲，大多數昆蟲皆爲卵生，所謂胎生，卽當子代離開母體時，已非卵期，而爲已經孵化的幼蟲，例如，有些蚜蟲和肉蠅（俗稱麻蠅）便具有胎生現象。</p>
<p>見蟲產卵的地位昆蟲產卵的地位，因種類而有不同，現在試舉幾個例子，以代表各種不同的產卵位置，例如，一般蛾類產卵在植物的表面，蝗蟲產卵在土中，蟬產卵在樹枝裏，少數的蠅產卵在葉的組織裏，寄生昆蟲（昆蟲中有寄生在別種昆蟲體上，以取得營養物的，呌做寄生昆蟲。）產卵在別種昆蟲體上，蜻蜓產卵在水中。關於昆蟲產卵習性上最奇特的一點，卽一種昆蟲，自然能够把卵產到他所需要的寄主（植物或動物）上，使幼蟲孵化後，容易取得所需的食料，所以昆蟲對於產卵地位的選擇，是非常準確的。</p>
<p>見蟲之生殖能力昆蟲生殖能力的大小，因種類而有不同，例如，有一種馬胃蠅，每决僅產卵一枚，但蜜蜂羣裏的后蜂，一生可產卵至1500000枚。赫胥黎敎授Prof．Huxely對於蚜蟲的生殖能力，曾經做過一種極饒興趣，而且很足驚人的統計，據赫氏的計算，設最初開始時祇有一個蚜蟲，其壽命爲二十日，此一個蚜蟲終生可產下二十個小的蚜蟲，則三百日以後，由這一個蚜蟲所生後裔，歷代蕃殖而得的個體數目，可增至。32768000000000000000假定一千個蚜蟲之總體重爲一克冷grain，（一克冷＝.0648gram）又假定一個人的體重爲2000000克冷，則一個人的體重，相當於20000s0000個蚜蟲之總重量，再2000000000一數，除32768000000000000000所得之商爲163840000這個意思就是說，以一年內，由一個蚜蟲開始蕃殖而得許多個體的總重量，應和1638400000個人的總體重相當，這個數目，比世界上任何人口繁盛國家的人口數，還要高出幾倍。昆蟲界裏有一部分專營寄生生活的寄生蜂，他們在發育上，有一種特殊方法，以增多個體的數目，此種方法，稱做增胚生殖，甚麼呌增胚生殖呢？通常一個受精卵只發育成一個個體，如果在胚胎發育期裏，具有增胚生殖現象，則一個受精卵，可以發育成一個以上的個體。</p>
<p>昆蟲在發育期間形狀上的改變古書上說過「腐草爲螢」，意思是說，夏天的螢蟲，是由腐草變成的，從前還有一般人，認魚子或蝦子可以變做蝗，而臆造所謂「化生說，」其實這些話皆不正確，腐草旣不會化成螢，魚子和蝦子更不會變成蝗，只有螢的子才會變螢，只有蝗的子才會變蝗，前人因爲對於昆蟲發生的情形，不甚明瞭，所以才有這種誤會。我們談到見蟲發生情形的時候，首先感覺到的，就是昆蟲在發育過程中，身體形狀，經過相當改變，這種改變，稱做變態。（也有很少數昆蟲在發育期間，形狀沒有改變的。）諸位看見過蝗蟲嗎？蝗蟲所產的卵，（蝗卵在土中成塊狀，每塊含有許多卵。）孵化後，成小的蝗蟲，（俗稱跳蝻）由跳蝻時期到飛蝗時期，身體形狀顯然經過改變，因爲跳蝻的體軀較飛蝗爲小，翅膀最初極小，在發育上愈趨近於飛蝗時期，翅便愈形長大，跳蝻時期生殖器尙未成熟，飛蝗時期則具發達的生殖器管。此外還有一類昆蟲，在發育期間，身體形狀的改變，更爲顯著，我們可以用家蠶來做代表，蠶卵孵化而成家蠶，家蠶體外沒有翅，胸部具有眞足，腹部具有假足，利用咀嚼式的口器，以嚙食桑葉，家蠶幼蟲發育到了相當程度，便呈第一次的形狀改變，而達蛹期，蛹期的形狀，漸趨近於蠶蛾，但却靜止不動，由蛹羽化爲蠶蛾，便呈第二决的形狀改變，蠶蛾和家蠶幼蟲的形狀，截然不同，蠶蛾體外具有翅和胸足，觸角等，但沒有假足，具有吸收式的口器，故不能　食桑葉，家蠶幼蟲的生活方法，旣和蠶蛾不同，則幼蟲期的身體構造，根本不適於蟲蛾期之用，因此，不得不經過一種改變，靜止的蛹期，便是形成這種改變的過渡時期</p>

<p>— 中央農業試騐所技師張乃鳳</p>
<p>諸位：今天這次敎育播音，是輪到兄弟講土壤改良法淺說。兄弟要講的土壤，是在農業上應用的土壤，是植物所賴以生長的東西。本來土壤的用處很多，可以築路，造房子，做磚瓦，做陶器等等。然而大部分的土壤是用作種植的。主要的農作物，都是生長土壤上面，所以兄弟要講的土壤，是用以種植的土壤。</p>
<p>在未講改良之前，我們應當先知道好土壤是怎麼樣，壞土壤是怎麼樣，然後才可以講怎樣拿壞的土壤變成好的土壤，這就是兄弟講這個題目的次序。換言之，我所要講的，第一是好土壤的條件，第二是壞土壤的種類，第三是怎樣改良土壤。</p>
<p>土壤對於生長在牠上面的植物的影響，可以分成一下六個因子：第一是供給水分。第二，供給空氣。第三，供給暖氣。第四，供給營養料。第五，沒有病蟲害。第六，有相當的深度，可以讓植物的根　，充分發展她的地位。這六個，就是由土壤所供給而可以支配植物生長的因子，如果有一個有缺點的時候，上面的植物就不能生長到很美滿的程度。</p>
<p>植物所需要的水分是很多。就一般而論，每一斤乾的植物，無論是稻草，是榖子，需要三百至六百斤的水來滋長牠。空氣也是一樣的重要，如果空氣不通，植物就要悶死。並且，土壤裏炭氣很多，如果沒有調節，植物也要受傷的。至於溫度，大半是靠天，小半也是靠土壤，有的土壤是暖的，有的土壤是比較冷一些。假如太冷，則植物不能生長，甚至於凍壞。假如太熱，則植物一樣的會熱死。就植物的營養料而言，當然是靠土壤供給，並且土壤裏面要沒有含着病蟲的成分，才不致妨害植物的生長。最後，土壤還要有相當的深度，大致要有兩三尺深，如果不到兩三尺，祗有少數的植物能生長，大的植物就不行了。</p>
<p>如果土壤是好的，那麼，牠的質地一定要不鬆也不粘。土壤粒子是兩三糎對徑的樣子。如果在同一地方的土壤，一種是成大塊的構造，一種是小團粒的構造，那麼。成大塊的土壤一定是差一些。諸位聽衆，你們不要以為所有的土壤，都是同你們所看到的一樣，有機會的時候，如果留意一下，便可以看到許多不同的構造，不同的顏色，和不同的性質。如果拿到化騐室裏邊來化騐一下，那麼，不同的性質是格外多了。再者，好的土壤挖下去，面上的七八寸應當很鬆，底下的稍微硬一些，但不至於硬到像磚塊的樣子，挖到七八尺深，底下應當是水。以上是說明好土壤的物理上的性質。至於牠的化學上的性質，應當富於營養料和有機質，（就是所謂腐植質）應當是不　也不太酸，大槪PHS.5.0-7.0之間。又土壤裏的可溶鹽分應當在百分之零點一以下。如是，物理上的性質既好，化學上的性質也好，那麼，微生物方面的性質也一定是合宜了。這種好的土壤，是直接的調節以前所講的六個因子。這六個因子就是水分，空氣，溫度，營養，植物的根鬚有可以發展到底下去的機會。</p>
<p>壞土壤的種類，可以分成氣候的關係，地熱的關係，土壤的鈉化的關係，和利用不合宜的關係六種。</p>
<p>氣候對於土壤的影響是很大，一種土壤所以成為某種的土壤，都是因為氣候的關係。關於這點，所以今天不預備細講，只拿兩種因為氣候的關係而使得土壤惡劣的情形講一講。第一是太乾，太乾的時候因是缺乏水分，以前說過，生長一斤乾的植物，需要三百至六百斤的水。所以水分缺乏，可以直接影響到植物生理上的作用。因為在這種情形之下，不但土壤中間的營養料不容易溶化，同時也减少植物吸收營料的機會。水分不夠的土壤，往往缺乏腐植質，即使有植物質藏在地裏面，因為水分太少的緣故，也是不容易腐爛。並且這樣的土壤又往往沒有滲濾作用，可以溶化的鹽類像炭酸鈣，硫酸鈣等物質留在土裏而造成一種富於可溶鹽類的土壤。土壤中既有大量的鹽類的存在，那是有害於植物的。第二是太濕，水分太多，土壤中間的空氣减少，植物就會首缺乏空氣的害處，又因為水分太多，土壤中間許多氧化作用，都停止了。同時水分的蒸發需要很多的熱力，所以濕的土，又比較冷一些，以上種種情形，都是不利於植物的生長的。</p>
<p>地勢對於土壤的關係，是很大的小坡上的土，常常受雨水的冲洗，非但土壤中間的養分和腐植質，被雨水冲去了，甚至整個的表土，受冲洗的作用而流到底下去。因表土　失而顯出來的底土，（即普通所謂之生土）往往是很瘠薄。新開的土山，最初兩年的地方很好，種了幾年之後，便不行了，大半是因為這個原因。在坡下的土，因為受到坡上冲下來的營養料和腐植質，這固然是很好，然而冲下来的也有不需要的鹽類，以致這個山坡下的土地變壞了。其次，就水分配而言，在山坡上的土壤中的水分，容易遺失，而在山坡下的山谷裏邊的水分，又不容易排泄，這都是地勢不良的害處。</p>
<p>土壤的質地對於土壤的性質的關係，可以分成兩種：一種是太鬆，一種是太粘，太鬆的土壤就是就是砂土，牠的毛病是缺乏粘土，因此。沒有保存水分的能力。雨水下來，馬上就排泄出去。也沒有保存養分的能力，施以肥料以後，不久就遺失了，並且括大風的時候，有整個的砂土，被風吹去的危險。太粘的土壤，不容易耕種，且因為粘韌的緣故，不但空氣不能流通，水分也不能調節。雨量多的時候水分太多，雨量少的時候水分便不夠，其次，因為粘的土壤裏，有許多很細的粒子，濕的時候漲大，乾的時候收縮，以致土壤容易起裂痕，在這種情形之下，植物根鬚容易傷。誠然，粘土在很多的時候，吸收水分的能力很大，但是土壤裏的水分雖多，植物却不能利用，同時，吸收肥料的能力也大，但是施用肥料以後，却往往不容易見效。總而言之，太粘的土壤，因為物理方面化學方面和微生物方面的種種影響，都使牠起一種不衛生的變化，對於一般的農作物都不合宜。</p>
<p>土壤的層次不適宜的時候，也可以使土壤很壞。有的土壤，底下有一層硬的磐層，這一層是很硬，使得植物的根，鑽不下去，天上下來的雨水也鑽不下去。有的土壤，底下有一層很鬆的砂土，在天旱的時候，水分升不上來，再有一種是土壤很薄，不到幾寸以下便是石頭，這三種都是土壤的層次不合宜。</p>
<p>所謂土壤鈉化是指一處土壤受了食鹽的侵蝕以後。最初是鹽分很多，慢慢的這些鹽裏邊的鈉質侵蝕到土壤的質地裏邊。這就是說，這些鹽不僅是存在土壤裏邊而和土壤起了一種化學上的作用。這樣的土壤，濕的時候往往是太粘，乾的時候又往往是很硬，並且土壤的塊頭很大，土壤的肥力很低，雨水略不適宜，所種的植物便容易出毛病。</p>
<p>以上五種壞的土壤，都可以歸納為天生的壞土壤。第六種是人為的壞土壤了。人為的壞土壤是因為土壤中間的營養料受了繼續的利用，而沒有相當的補充，以至愈種愈壞。這種情形，在我們中國是很普遍。其原因：一則由於沒有足夠的肥料，二則由於沒有注意到好的輪栽制度，所以就發生這種結果。不過這種人為的壞土壤，是容易改良的，只要施用適當的肥料便行了。至於怎樣施用適當的肥料，這個問題很複雜，兄弟在今天不預備細講。</p>

<p>西陲通訊</p>
<h3 id="c73">青海旅行記（續） <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— 莊學本</p>
<p>地理和歷史　關於我們在塘巴堡有二天的考察，土人的一功知道一些大概。</p>
<p>塘巴堡共分六個莊子：一塘巴堡，二白崖莊，三崖頭莊，四小寺莊，五菜子溝，六塘巴莊，都在沙塘川的東岸，現在劃分爲進化共和二鄕，以前僅有十三戶，名塘巴大戶，長受大戶，崖頭戶，永安戶，新莊戶，小寺戶，布隆戶，小莊戶，二郎保戶，鐵嶺戶，公他戶，大菜子戶，藥木戶。但是現在已繁殖至四百戶；其間十分之八是純粹的土民，十分之二爲移來的漢民。</p>
<p>前淸的時候他們還是土司制，受着東祁土司的管轄，土司底下還有一名千總，一名把總，二名總管。</p>
<p>東祁土司的先祖：朶兩只失結仕，是西域的纏頭族，元朝爲甘肅行省右丞。明洪武四年授指揮僉事世職，子端竹洪武二十九年襲職，歿於陣，贈驃騎將軍，賜姓祁。至十世孫祁秉忠，萬歷十九年襲指揮同知職，後以功提督薊遼左都督，加太子少保，樹碣湟中，至淸，秉忠之子祁國屛，順治二年歸附，九年襲指揮同知職，生子祁伯豸仲豸，俱有武略。伯豸以功陞鑾儀使，仲豸康熙九年武進士，後以功晋浙江金華副總兵。嗣後子孫世襲，今住樂都縣北四里勝番溝，祁煥即其裔也。（上錄「最近之，靑海」）</p>
<p>所以他們的道喇中間有唱他們土司祁總兵的歷史，民國成立以後，幾個頭腦淸醒的土民，在西寗府提了一張狀紙，從此把祁土司的頭銜革掉，塘巴堡也就脫離了土司的束縛，十九年八月以前，互助新縣尙未成立，此地西寨縣管轄。</p>
<p>女勤而男惰</p>
<p>塘巴的土人很早已脫離了遊牧社會，耕山地務農爲生，但是他們的習氣還和遊牧社會相彷彿，家庭和田中的工作都依頓女子爲中心，懶惰的男子除了耕地以外一切田中事家中的事都不去過問。莊稼一年出一季因爲當地的氣候很冷，寒季長，暑季短。夏季又多氷雹，八九月就下雪。所以莊稼在立夏下種，立秋收穫。主要的農產爲靑稞，麥子，大豆。</p>
<p>他們從事商業的很少。手工業也幼稚，祇能製毡，製褐，（羊毛布）。所以他們的經濟多不很寬裕。有五六畝田，一二頭牛，十幾隻羊，的就稱「小大戶，」——小康之家了。借貸的利息很高，普通自二分半至四五分。田價很低，每畝僅値五六十釧，的合國幣十元左右。捐稅很大，每畝田須年納糧稅五六十釧。此外的差徭也很多，工資則很低，每日替人做苦工的代價，除供給勝食以外，僅得五分至一角。</p>
<p>奇特的裝束</p>
<p>土人的衣篩，四五歲以上的小孩，多沒有袴穿，現在在零下十度的冬天，他們小腿都凍得像紅蘿葡一樣。男子富的和漢人一樣穿布匹，普通就用褐子做衣料。式樣和漢人的長衫一樣，他們也有黃色的皮膚，棕黑色的眼球，和黑色的頭髮，扁平的臉部，漢裝以後，和漢人已不能分別。但是他們女子的裝飾很値得來介紹，普通工作的時期！布袴，長褐衣，束腰，赤足，戴翻邊氊帽。夏季載傘式的小圓笠帽。新年節日，穿紅袖衣，束花腰帶兩耳戴銀環下垂如練，頸中套一個大項圈：上面釘滿如銅圓般磨光的白蚌殼，髮飾：戴一聳起尺許如簸箕形的紅帽，帽子用紅紙版鐵絲做成，邊上全是下垂的紅鬚頭，因牠像簸箕，所以通稱叫「簸箕頭」，後面用鏽花如銀碗式的飾物，覆在她們的髮髻上，另外再用一尺長的一支銀簪或銅簪橫挿在腦後。她們額際的紅鬚頭，作三角形，如舊式的前留海一般。成年的女子，未嫁的褲管上棍一塊很闊的大紅邊，已嫁的棍黑色邊，這也算是她們處女與婦人外表的一些分別。</p>
<p>與牛羊同睡</p>
<p>他們的飲食以靑稞麥子爲主；製成麵，或　，或炒爲　耙。夏季麵片中什以野菜，呼爲「綠草飯」。平常男子多喜歡喝酒，酒用清複核加麯釀成，十日可飲。色清味淡，因爲容易上口，所以他們每飲輒醉。</p>
<p>住屋大多是方形的平房，外面一轉土墻，圍成一個院落。中間養着鷄犬豬，同時作爲牛羊牲口的圈柵。住屋多用土墻隔成三四閒，中間的一間作爲掛神像的經堂，和會客之用。一面是寢室。一面作廚房。小輩和冬季中的牛犢羊羔均睡在灶房中。睡的土坑，就和灶相連。用一條矮矮的土壁隔開，前面煮飯，後面睡人。他們在冬季的寒夜，不用再另行燒坑，正是他們一種聰明而經濟的辦法。他們睡時很混雜，多數的男女都睡在一起，他們也和番人一樣沒有被褥，睡時解下他的腰帶，白天的衣服就作晚上的被褥。</p>
<p>婚喪的禮俗</p>
<p>土人的風俗男女的社交很公開，同年的男女交朋友，叫「連手」。男子與男子交朋友，叫「拜弟兄」。女子與女子交朋友，叫「拜乾姊妹」。</p>
<p>然而他們的婚事多由父母主張，中間有一個媒人往來說合，還脫不了專制的遺習。財禮有牛·羊·牲口·布匹·毡子·靑稞·酒·等，以男家的經濟狀况而定，富者納聘七八十元，貧者二三十元不等。接親用牲口作代步，入門參拜天地，新婦進灶房。此時女家的親屬也都到男家來歡宴，大家圍坐在莊前的庭園中；抱酒罈，上飾羊毛一片，開始「道喇」，且飲且歌，兩相酬唱，以歌調多，聲音脆的，爲榮耀。男家欵待親戚的酒席，用油炸　　，菜包子等，分爲三道；第一道名「盤山茶」，第二道名「燒麥茶」，第三道名「牛肋巴茶」</p>
<p>現在的婚姻，也比較自由，但是雙方對後，仍須經過父母媒妁的一翻聘定手續。結婚的年齡多在十五歲以下。</p>
<p>喪葬多用火葬，土人死後，抬屍於野外，一請喇嘛誦經超度，挖一土坑，架火焚化。</p>
<p>宗教的信仰</p>
<p>土人的宗敎亦爲喇嘛敎，所以有幾個兒子的家庭，也要抽送一二個去當喇嘛。每一個人烟稠密的莊子上，必有一所莊廟。莊子附近的高山尖上，堆一個麻柳堆，插幾根樹枝，掛幾塊經布，作爲他們的山神。</p>
<p>他們對於護法神箭信仰很深，護法：有「五台護法」，「牛頭護法」，「羊頭護法」，等名稱。他們的家中都供着一個護法，他們又對於Lamason「騾子天王」，也生相當信仰；騾子天王是一位靑面獠牙醜陋的神道，騎着一匹靑騾子。他在喇嘛敎中，並沒有很高的地位。此外他們對於大鵬鳥，十二個天神，也都相當的敬禮。</p>
<p>莊子附近的山坡上，大路口，建了很多的「彭康」。彭康是一個四方事子，中間用土封的木版印成的泥佛「喳喳」。這樣的彭康，在各地喇嘛寺附近本來也有，但是土民建築更多，因爲他們很信仰彭康能擋去夏季的雹災。當土人的莊上未建彭康以前，雹災很多，以後就逐漸减少了。他們在初一，十五，及空閑的時候，多繞着牠轉誦嗡嘛呢叭咪吽，祈禱。</p>
<p>土人不很洗臉，更不知洗澡，因爲不講求衛生，所以疾病很多，生了病到廟中去許願或請神。他們迷信神權。一次我們在莊上閑遊。土人抱了一個多病的小孩，要我們舉足在他的小頭上踏一下，這樣小孩就能却病延年。不可理喩的土人，我們也只能照他的吩咐踏了一脚。</p>
<p>路旁的煤礦</p>
<p>初三的晚上，我們回到縣政府，過了一宿。一月二十七日，一早，由縣長派了王主任和一個警察，幾匹牲口，送我們赴縣東六十里的紅康子溝去；因爲我們須要在比較純粹一些的土民莊子上，再作進一步的考察。</p>
<p>十時出了東門，迎着太陽趕去。五里到東溝，也是土人的莊子，幾個親戚家去的紅衣土女，抱着孩子，騎上白馬，映着山尖的白雪，溝中的堅冰，構成一幅美麗和諧的圖畫。</p>
<p>以下人跡稀少，十里經哈拉直溝，也是互助的一條巨川，溝沿上發現有灰黑色的煤炭，雖然表面上的品質很劣，但是底下定有較好的煤層。</p>
<p>翻過了二個較高的土山、，馬蹄就踏上紅崖子溝的邊岸，和平的土人們望着幾個新旅客訝異，穿過了一段苗條的白楊林，左首的山坡下就有一排土房接觸我們的眼簾警察牽着我的牲口在一段土牆前站下。幾個土人很恭敬的迎出門來，很小心的取過我們的毯子，舖在正屋中火坑上，　我們進去。</p>
<p>這裏有寬大的庭院，軒敞的房屋，繫齊的馬槽，過去就是桑思格李土司的衙門。垂暮的時時候，一位六十五歲瘦削蒼老的老叟，扶病出來，與我們寒　，他就是土司李承襄，我們得他的招待，一連就在此地躭擱了五天，直到初八「佑寗寺」的跳神過後，纔回西　。</p>

<p>埋頭苦幹有志竟成</p>

<p>研製十年</p>
<p>該廠廠長葛天民、奉、前於旅日期間、因邦著名、製造捲菸紙增井辰三郎氏為莫逆交、曾於茶餘酒後、探討其原料製法、寖假歲月、獲悉頗多、復派共戚洪紹亭、入北川造紙廠為工役、實地工作、達十年之久、沉著觀察、埋頭苦幹、深悉其製造方法、不復能忍、於去年購機歸國、設廠仿製、經一年之改善、竟得成功、</p>
<p>正式出貨</p>
<p>該廠現已籌足十萬資本、另向外國購到、專造捲菸紙大機器一部、連同舊夠者共有二部、現已在製造中、惟因註册手續、一時未易辦就、且按實業部前頒獎勵工業條例第一條所規定、該廠此項創製、照例應獲得全國各地行銷十年以下之專製權、除已派員赴京、向實業部長呈請獎勵外、聞該廠於組織方面、力求科學化、據樂君言、該廠現正籌辦安全設備·衛生設備·暨工人簡易壽險等、每年列入預算數耳、不下數千元云、</p>
<p>挽回漏巵</p>
<p>查捲菸紙雖極微小之物、然因國人嗜吸者多、故內年消耗數量極大、按華商菸廠、每年出烟、達百萬箱、每箱需捲菸紙一圈、故每年所耗捲菸紙亦需百萬圈、但事實上該廠决無偌大產量、因其範圍有限、兩部機器、供不應求、為異日必然之趨勢、近日本外埠捲菸廠、向該廠索取樣品者、為數頗多、惟該廠因發行手績、部署未臻妥貼、致暫時未饜各界之所望云、</p>

<p>閩省實施識字敎育、民國十八年就巳開始、因經費缺乏、設校無多、民國二十一年敎育廳廳長鄭貞文、回閩主持敎政、認識字敎育、有加緊進行的必要、向省政府提議組織普及識字敎育委員會、專辦識字敎育事宜、由省會各社敎機關、社團聯合組織、直接隸屬於省政府、開辦伊始、先舉行宣傳工作、繼以全市文盲調查、一面由識字會設立民衆學校、全市九十四所、共一百七十七級、利用各公私立學校敎室、及公共機關、為施敎場所、並通知不識字民衆就學、計民衆入學者、五千六百六十八人、至於敎學人員、由各機關公務員、及各學校敎員充任、完全義務職、不給津貼、第一期自四月起至八月止、舉行畢業測騐、結果民衆畢業者二千五百零三人、第二期民校於九月開始、設校計畫漸由城市、移到附城各鄕、並就省會五個警區內、設立中心民校五所、分任各該區行政事項、統計設校一百一十級、就學學生四千五百餘人、於九月十五日開課、不幸開課纔有兩月、閩變發生、各校停頓、識字會亦受影響停辦、此為閩省普及識字運動之第一時期、</p>

<p>强迫時期</p>
<p>因此種辦法、過去未有先例、可為標榜、欲推行順利、應先加以試騐、藉作將來寔施標準識字會於去年八月起、辦理全省强迫識字、至今已六個月、劃定閩侯第三區內十三鄕、並長樂第四區為試騐區、先後派員分別辦理、除閩侯第三區業已結束、受强迫識字計四千一百二十六人外、長樂試騐區尙在繼續辦理、至本省各縣市奉令辦理强迫識字後、都已積極推行、截至二十五年一月底止、各縣市中已設校寔施强迫識字的、共有三十八縣市、一特區、計辦一千六百八十一校、除四百六十一校、未將就學人數報吿外、計已知就學人數、有五萬六千餘人、尚有十七縣一特區、籌備至二月底止、亦可開課、至完全未籌設民校的、只有八縣一特區、</p>

<p>— Louisa　M.Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>到此方發現了全劇裏最大的精采。先看見一根粗繩在台板上拍着，忽然見它拉緊一抽，聽見愛彌聲音喊着：「舉起，開向前來！」又聽見賴司務一個粗聲音回答道，「穩些—呀—穩些！「接着是一陣笑聲，因為四個大的灰色老鼠出現了，腿是在發抖，尾巴也頗異樣，然而頭部很神氣，黑鬍子看去是維妙維肖的。它們：拖着—或者意思是要看去像是拖着的樣子—一輛高大美好的車子，這是用那個南瓜王的一半做成的，放在坦第小車的輪盤上，這幾個輪盤也是塗黃了以與那顏色鮮明的車身相配。高樓在前面的位子裏的是一個快樂的小御者，他戴上白的假髮，聳起的帽子，穿上大紅的短袴，和鑲花邊的上衣，抽着一條長鞭，勒動幾個紅韁繩，那麼有力，竟使四匹灰色的駿馬，人－般地立了起來。這馬夫是坦第份的，他向客人點頭笑着，看去那麼有趣，他們便先對他喝一陳朵；勞笠姨丈說道，「假如我能夠找到那麼一個認眞做事的御者，我便當立即僱定了他。」馬車停了，義母將小娘子抱上，她於是高踞在上，轟轟而去，一路還向看客揮手表情，她的玻璃鞋子，崛起在前面，她緋色的拖裙後面一直掃着地上，因為車上雖然美好，可是這美人兒坐在其中已是很緊凑的了。</p>
<p>下一幕是跳舞會，在這裏南恩和小梅打扮得絢爛有如孔雀一般。南恩扮那個驕傲的異母妹特別合式，她一路掃過那個宮中的殿裏時，彷彿可使那兒無數的紛黛齊被壓倒。那個王孫公子，孤獨地坐在一偭不穩的寶座上，從一個重大的冠冕底下注視他的四周，同時在舞弄他的寶劍，或者欣賞他鞋上絲織的玫瑰花。他看到灰娘進來了便一躍而起，急不擇言，但却亦很熱誠地喊道。</p>

<p>就大勢言，去年一月份至五月份，各匯均一致放長，六月份及七月份匯市，以外銀步跌，隨而下游，英匯自一先令七便士一二五落至一先令六便士七五，美匯自三十九美元三一二五落至三十六美元七五。迨人八月初旬，貿易出口略動，進口呆滯，按理外匯應有變動，惟數月以來，真正商業上之匯兌需要，所占殊微，至其所以如是，由於一般人對於前途有戒心，故如中旬倫敦銀價跌落，上海匯價背道而馳，由於有力投機家之操縱明甚。蓋自去年十月開徵平衡稅以後，匯價與平價已脫離關係。上下其間，可由人為，至下旬始歸於穩定。九月匯市平淡無奇，十月足以引起匯價之變動者，厥為中國貨幣問題之將來·蓋通貨膨脹貨幣貶值之聲浪，傳聞已久，尤以是月份為最烈；上海對外匯價即在此穩聲浪中節節下降，英匯竟由十月一日之一先令六便士八一二五，縮至三十一日之一先令二便士七五，英匯二月期之價格最低至一先令二便士六二五，美匯由三十八元半跌至三十元三一二五，各匯前後相差，英匯在四便士以上，美匯在八元以上，十一月初，英匯每國幣一元縮去半便士，美匯每國幣百元縮去一元美金，蓋由於財部四日頒布停止使用現銀並令三行無限制買賣外匯，財部緊急法令第六項原文曰：「為使法幣對外匯價按照目前價格穩定起見，應由中中交三銀行無限止買賣外匯」（註六）遂自十一月四日起，中央銀行之掛牌價，即公定英匯為一先令二便士合法幣一元，美匯為二十九元美金又四分之三，合法幣百元，日匯為一百零三元日金合法幣百元，不加變化，茲再將一年來各匯波動狀況，列表如下：（註七）</p>

<p>去年一月份，金市極為清淡，二月份金價步步下降，絕少回升，全月最高為九百七十八元七角，最低為八百七十二元，一月之差額，竟達一百零六元五角之鉅。查其慘跌之原因，　美國金條方案判決，政府幾獲全部勝利。　我國財部一再獎勵白銀進口。　謠傳中英借欵，可告成立。　海外銀價節節上漲。結果市價跌入九百元大關。三月份金價跌風再接再厲，一因受用金國家故意人為方法，抑低其貨幣價值。一因我國現銀流出過鉅，不得不在倫敦收購白銀，同時於上海拋售標金，因此金市奔放直下，中旬始見平穩。下旬則以英商沙遜氏建議，以英借欵發行上海鎊劵，及美銀派領袖湯麥斯白銀修正案，遭眾院否決，加以金市籌碼缺乏，市場形成軋空局面，金價隨之扶搖直上，有迫近八百九十元關之勢。四月份再起反動，金價重向下游，每日差度亦自十餘元增至三十餘元，及二十五日，因傳美國政府正式提高銀價，跌風尤見慘厲，一日之間猛跌三十元，是月份金市最低為七百四十一元五角，實為前年關金結價以來之第一次新低價。五朋市況呈盤旋之勢，金價最高為八日之收盤八百零一元七角，最低價為十八日之七日四十九元八角，全月金價，始終起伏於七百五十元至八百元之間。六月份徘徊於七百七十元左右，下旬市況豁然轉漲，二十二日衝出八百元大關，蓋為中央銀行有運現出口及通貨有膨脹之說。七八九月，金價無特殊變動。十月份發生金業交易所恐自有史以來所未見之狂漲，由八七九元二角之價漲至一千二百十一元，前後相差竟達三百三十七元八角之鉅。雖中央銀行竭力維持，亦難挽回其狂瀾。至月底數日，傳說中國改革幣制將於十一月初實現，海關金單位，有即將提高至二元五說，大戶猛購，散戶追隨金價直上雲霄，於三十一日見一千二百十元新高峰，十一月事已實行，金市亦失其雄姿（未完）</p>

<p>— 林石</p>
<p>呂敎授覺得近幾年來很少如此憂鬱過，今天似乎簡直就體騐到憂鬱的最深的滋味。他委實在屋子裏待不住，無論如何非到外面去溜達溜達不可。何况他是一个无家室的人，並沒有一個女性來安慰他，所以格外覺得從　　到　　都很空虛，這　他拚命的在踱來踱去的吐着烟圈也不能塡滿的。唯一的機會只有當差的送上茶來的時候，他很想就和他談談也好，可是一看到平素就十分拘謹到呆笨的樣子，簡直就不能和他多談半句話，所以還只好瞪着他加了一些煤到爐子裏去，再瞪着他一點聲音也沒有的，像個幽靈似的兩脚筆直的移出了房門。而且連他剛才所帶來的一些活氣也依然帶走了，只留下煤爐裏輕微的煤塊炸裂聲。這使呂敎授由憂悒轉爲氣憤，狠狠的將手裏的半根纸烟摔在地下使勁的　熄了，好像就是抽烟使他煩惱似的。立刻　捷的披了外　　了　　　　　，預備出門。可是回轉身來，看見剛才　熄的烟蒂，不免污了地板，而且大半根烟也很可惜，便又平心靜氣的拾起來放在桌上，然後挺了一挺腰走出門去。</p>
<p>出得門來，心頭還是憂　，似乎今晚的街燈也陰黯了許多。北風使勁的刮在他的臉上，他不得不將頭縮在大氅領子裏去。</p>
<p>走了許多路，拐了好多次灣，可是他還沒有確定該向什麽地方走去。不久，一家京戲場擺在旁邊，他便買了座位走進場去。果然裏面熱鬧得很，空氣也和外面大不相同，祗要觀客們喜形於色的神氣和纸烟的瀰漫，已經夠使塲子裏暖和起來。可是沒有多久，他又懊悔着不該進來。理由可以找出很多：　如台上的大　大鈸，簡直就吵鬧得幾乎要刺破他的耳膜。平常他總覺得在劇場裏很可以休息一下，然而今天却惱恨那些吹鼓手是在有意和他搗麻煩。還有那些觀客們，一刻也不肯停的咳嗽，　額上和頸上的靑筋都硬起來。他們用着各種不同的姿態和聲音爭着吐痰，這兒在吐，那兒也在吐，好像他們原來是約好了花錢到這兒來吐痰的，否則就犯不着白花錢。這使呂敎授　了好幾口氣，表示他眞有些厭煩的意思。再有許多娘兒們，却拚命的嗑瓜子，跟着台上的丑角兒小小樂樂，一點也不來體會呂敎授憂悒的心情，這也使他很氣。總而言之，這裏的人們，對於呂敎授那漠不關心，誰也不來安慰他一下，誰也不來理睬他，好像人世間根本就沒有他存在，但在他認爲這是很不應該的。當然他也頗能　　　理，　使他和身旁的人說：</p>
<p>「喂！今天我看了上海的外國報，我的兄弟　給打死了，一點也不錯。你知道他很年輕，也確實不應該死。」可是聽話的人會同情他一番嗎？不會，他猜得準；何况在坐的都是他不認識的人。</p>
<p>他忿忿的走出劇場，因爲他相信這兒一定找不着一點安慰。唯一的辦法，只好去找平素過往最密的周先生談談去。他向西方走去，他沒有忘記周先生是住在系邊度一條胡同。</p>
<p>還是刮着風，總算是沒有落雨下來。</p>
<p>一路上呂敎授愈想愈難過；弟弟的血淋淋的頭，老在他眼前隱隱約約。一想到這裏，他幾乎要哭出來了。</p>
<p>到了周先生的書房，周先生忙着在桌上寫，一面很隨便的讓他在旁邊坐下。因爲屋子裏有火，他便脫了大氅坐下來，一句話也沒有說。其後周先生擱了筆旋轉身來和他說：</p>
<p>「這些時候，趁着學生們罷課，我要把我的政治　　　完成它。現在已經寫了五分之三了。不過一天到晚忙着寫，手也　痛了。」</p>
<p>呂敎授沒有答一句話，只是聽着。接着周先生又說：</p>
<p>「你怎麼的？這些時候你怎樣消遣？趁着學校裏不上課，你不編　　，　在屋子裏待着，也悶得慌呀。」</p>
<p>「嗯」！</p>
<p>「昨天我打了一次牌」，周先生又說：「我運氣還不壞，贏了二十幾塊。」</p>
<p>「嗯」。呂敎授　是嗯，使周先生很掃興，他又旋轉身去寫講義，看來今晚一定非寫完不可。留下呂敎授向着爐子裏的火光發呆。因爲太靠近火爐的原故，他的兩腿給烤得很痛。這使他聯想起家裏的火爐，出門的時候，忘記敎當差的熄掉，燒到現在，一定白燒了不少。想來他非回家不可，然而他是打定主意來和周先生談談的，他怎麼　跑來一句話也不說的又跑回去呢？他燃上纸烟，吸了很久，周先生還是忙着寫講義不理他。看看手錶，已經快到十點半鐘，他畢竟向周先生　口了：</p>
<p>「喂，我的兄弟最近給打死了。」</p>
<p>「噢？你還有一個兄弟的麽？」周先生並不旋轉身來，還在不停的寫。</p>
<p>呂敎授决定立刻回家去，唯一能同情他的，恐怕還祗有他的僕人。很迅速的他走上了回家的道上。走着，沒有歡喜，也沒有哀愁，祗是微微的憤恨</p>
<p>這一個找尋同情的人，想到了已死的兄弟，也想到家裏沒有熄掉的爐火；他心頭的憤怒在燃燒着。</p>

<p>—北國素描之二—</p>
<p>潮水慢慢地退去，海也在漸漸消瘦了。先前隱在水中的一些暗礁，都嶙峋地裸露出來，現着黛綠的或者赭黃德姿影，仿佛一羣海中動物，要在初出的陽光中，曝晒牠們的背脊似的。</p>
<p>孫大漢子在後海沿上走着，朝海灣瞟了一眼，便趕快加緊了足步，高低不平的人行道上，就立即有潮濕的泥沙，在他足後跟下，濺跳起來。他平日是不注意什麽鐘錶的，而他自己裏以及左右鄰居，都沒有置備這類奢侈品的能力，可是他也能推測日子和時間的，那便是憑他門外按時漲退的海潮了。</p>
<p>和他一道走的一位鄰居，是要道東洋宰畜公司去殺牛的，身上用皮帶斜掛着幾把尖刀子，足下穿着長統的膠皮鞋子，（倘若衣褲上沒有粘污着牛血的話，說成將軍倒滿像的。）嘴角上　着短烟管，慢吞吞地拉着大步，一面說着這後海沿的美國海軍棧橋一成功，洋兵都打這兒登岸，他敢打賭，一切生意都會好起來的，假如大家朋友肯揍錢，開家熟食店，把公司里面爛掉的牛雜牛血之類弄出來，燉給拉洋兵的車夫吃，那可了不得。話雖是像往天早上的閒談一樣，看見什麽就隨便講什麽，但歸根結蒂，還是隱隱乎想脫離了公司，自家做老板，幹一點小本生意的　孫大漢子對這可沒有趣味，他是在外國漁業公司里面做工的，即使平日有過什麽夢想，也不外是，回到先前的日子，驾着一隻船，　兩個夥計，到膠州灣以及更遠處的海面，去　理打漁的生涯罷了。而何况海的姿容，潮的消退，在告訴他時間已不早了呢，自然更沒心腸，把鄰居的閒談，再聽下去。</p>
<p>「　，那麼急，做什麽？去早了，恐怕還沒開門哩。」</p>
<p>「哪里？你看哪，今天怕遲一點！」</p>
<p>孫大漢子一面急急忙忙地走，一面向路邊的海灣揮一揮手，意思是要他的鄰居，看看那架自然界的鐘錶。</p>
<p>但他的鄰居，雖是老居住海邊，和海很接近，可對於海的性子，却是極其不熟悉的了，只是漠然地，一面隨着孫大漢子指點的方向觀望去，一面取下短烟管來，彈彈烟上燒去灰燼。</p>
<p>海的近處，美國的海軍棧橋，剛在水面造成許多水泥的　子，旁邊　着機械的小火輪，正把疏浚泥沙的一串鐵　箕拉動着，看去仿佛許多烏龜，不斷地在從水里爬出來一樣。</p>
<p>再遠些地方，便是掛茶褐色風帆的小船，正吃飽着晨風，滿載洋貨，趁着退潮，馳到灣口外邊去。</p>
<p>一切，都同往天差不多，看不出孫大漢子所指的意義來，但也沒有趕去聽着他，下細深究的必要，因爲一向就見慣不驚了，這個陰沉的漁夫，自從船和網子押當以後，便愛說些使人莫名其妙的話。更何況，自己只是信口閒談，沿路消遣而已，其他，有什麽計較頭呢。</p>
<p>所以，一見孫大漢子不等他，他便立刻令旁邊另一個人談起別的來了。</p>
<p>外國漁公司是在小港的邊上，幾隻叫做什麽丸的小輪船，就一個挨一個地停在門前。一些短壯的外國漁夫，頭上勒着污舊的白毛巾，足下登着長統的膠皮靴子的，都忙忙碌碌地從艙底抓出魚和冰塊來。中國苦力便兩人一箱地，從船上抬到公司裏去，好像一羣搬家的螞蟻一樣。</p>
<p>大家都是忙得要命的，只一個短小瘦削的中年人，上身穿着皮馬靴的，態度非常悠閒，時而立在岸邊，時而站在過道上，手裡拿着一根筆直的木棍子。不是用来点点他的馬靴尖頭或者馬靴中部。</p>
<p>孫大漢子跑到他的面前，一邊舉起魚腥的袖頭，揩揩額頭上的汗珠，一邊惶恐地說着，今天來遲的原因，是女人和孩子病了，不得不待在家一會兒。希望原諒，不要扣除工錢。</p>
<p>「呵，太太和少爺病了」，瘦削短小的人，斜起眼睛瞟孫大漢子一眼，「你還來做什麽呢，該待在家裏侍候哪」。說畢，就走到門前過道上去。</p>
<p>孫大漢子見他並沒有發氣，雖是話不對勁，也不管了，就一直走進門去，打算動手幹起活來。但那瘦削短小的人，却把棍子朝門口一擱，冷冷地說道：</p>
<p>「怎麼不聽話，我叫你家去哪。」</p>
<p>接着厲聲起來：</p>
<p>「讓開，讓開，你看，携着別人了！」</p>
<p>隨即靜靜地走到岸邊去，更把木棍子慇懃地點着馬靴的尖頭。</p>
<p>孫大漢子尾在他得後面，低聲懇着，一面心裏恨恨地想道：這個三寸丁榖樹皮一樣的傢伙，只消咱老子一拳就打下海去了。但他也明白，在這個港邊威脅他的，並不是這個小東西，而是一個更大更厲害，有如惡魔的，可是他却把牠表達不出來。所以他不得不彎下腰幹，對這小東西，說些可憐的話語。</p>
<p>那個瘦削矮小的人，老是冷冷靜靜的，毫不生氣的樣子。當這個巨人低下的額頭，快要挨近他得肩膀時，才斜起眼睛說道：</p>
<p>「你還是養息一天的好，再不然，你也會生病的。像你的太太少爺一樣。」</p>
<p>孫大漢子，只有勉強苦笑着。</p>
<p>「先生，不要開玩笑，俺們苦人兒，一天不做工，就要餓肚皮。」</p>
<p>瘦削矮小的人，沿着岸邊輕輕走開了。孫大漢子仍然着頭，尾了過去。</p>
<p>「先生，求你老人家做做好事吧，老婆兒子，唔，病的爬不起來，說不定會……（聲音哽咽起來）讓俺做一天，算半天的工錢，唔，好不好？」</p>
<p>瘦削矮小的人心裏動了一下，但他看看碼頭下的漁輪，這早上已經少到了幾隻，工作是比往天少的，何必再添人呢。便沉默地走開幾步，眼睛並不瞧一下身邊這個巨人。</p>
<p>幾個高麗人，穿着不潔淨的白衣白裙，提着小小的洋鐵桶，走下碼頭去叫小船。她們是要到海島上去採蠔和海葉的，一路輕捷地笑語着。</p>
<p>一瘦削矮小的人，便拿眼睛盯着她們，當她們的小船。已經浮在港中的時候，他還沒有　開一會兒。</p>
<p>孫大漢子竭力壓着哽哽噎噎的聲音。</p>
<p>「先生，俺家裏，一個板兒（銅板）也不剩了，……又……又借不出。……俺今天一定要找點工錢，家去買……買藥哩。」</p>
<p>瘦削矮小的人，忽然忘乎其境地，用手觸一觸孫大漢子的腰部，像對老朋友那麼似的說道：</p>
<p>「你看，那幾個婊子，哪一個漂亮？」……媽的，還不坐下去，呵，一定閃着腰幹了」。</p>
<p>說尾後兩句話時，他的眼睛，又望到港中去了。小船上的高麗女人，有一個年紀最靑，臉蛋兒胖胖的，始終沒有坐着，正在這時，突然給船搖擺了兩下，她的身子就馬上傾側起來。同船的女人，大聲嘩笑着。笑聲和魚腥的海風，一齊播送過來。</p>
<p>孫大漢子禁不住抬起頭來，隨着望去，但眼睛已有點兒潤濕了，什麽也瞧不淸楚，只見一些船的糢糊影子，在水上來來去去的。</p>

<p>— 魏中天</p>
<p>自己的身體，雖然不能說是十分好，可是，這二三年來，雖曾餓了不少次肚子，受了許多驚嚇，嗅過死尸里紫血的臭味，聞過地獄里各種啼聲，而仍未曾害過一次病，在不幸中還算是値得慶倖的事。我自己常常是這樣感到安慰。</p>
<p>萬不曾料到，在最近，却害了一次小病。不過，總說是「病」，也不能說是「不幸」吧，橫豎窮人在這年頭，生病或挨餓，那眞是平常又平常的了。說句笑話吧，「病對於窮人也許是有益的事呢，因爲病了三天五天，就可以節省下三天五天的食糧了。但這却是只限於「小病」，如果是大病，那可不行了，因爲大病需得進醫院，可是醫藥費從何而來呢？</p>
<p>說老實話，一個人如果閑着無工作，生活又不好，那末，小病一二次也確是不壞的事情。所謂「小病」，當然是無需乎請醫生，也無需乎吃藥，靜靜地躱在床上，却有一個較好的機會給自己思索過去與未來。過去：在什麽地方在什麽時候中了敵人的暗箭？什麼時候又給狗咬過一次？……未來：世界何時才會變了顏色？何時才不會有人吃人的血？……這些事，只有在小病中，反覆地思索着，才另有一種情味埋在心頭。</p>
<h3 id="c194">論空想小說 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 芷英</p>
<p>「空想小說」在近世文學史上，佔着相當廣訊的位置。像莫理恩的「　無　消息」，辛克萊的「兩千年」，傑克倫敦的「鐵　」等書，也早被我國介紹過了，並且在我們本國的作品中，也有同樣的作品，如張天翼的「鬼土日記」，老舍的「貓城記」之類。</p>
<p>作爲文藝現象的一種重要的流派，是値得我們加以考究的。我們應該從社會的基本的觀點上來看看空想小說（烏托邦小說）的本質，然後，我們才能批判空想小說的價値。而且，我們在這裏還得限定談論的範圍，即我們所要說的空想小說，是社會的空想小說。像「西遊記」或唐人的「遊仙　」之類的東西，是不在我們的討論範圍內的。</p>
<p>在社會的空想小說之發展史上，英國的莫理思是一個典型的作者。莫理思生在十九世紀後半的英國，在六七十年代，英國的市民社會還保存着可　的「安穩」，還閃着「黃金時代」的光輝。所以作爲作家的莫理思，是一個藝術的唯美主義者。但到了八十年代，英國因爲德國和美國等新興的市民國家的打擊，經濟上已顯出了窘绌人破　。因此國內的階　人軋　，也特別地明顯和尖銳化了。在這種社會的經濟基礎上，唯美主義的莫理思也在作品的美容上起了變化；這是因爲莫理思的唯美主義，沒有和那純粹觀念論的神秘主義結在一起的綠故。現實在畸形的制度下產生了悲慘的黑暗面，一切的發展和自由，變成了財富和權力的奴隸。莫理思曉得在這樣的環境下，藝術是必要死滅的，因爲人類正在走着沒落之路。因此他對於這種制度，發生了一種反感。這種反感，促成他投身在社會運動之中，他想用美和藝術來鼓舞下層人民的運動的發展。然而，作爲一個小市民的他，並不能堅決地把對於過去的懷　之衣脫下，他仍然保留着他的過去的藝術樂園幻想。弗理契對此稱之爲「革命性　考古學的交錯」，可說是恰切的形容句。這種不滿現在，憧憬過去，幻望未來的「交錯」，被藝術地反映在他的有名的小說「虛無鄉消息」中。在這部小說裏，奏着自由平等的未來社會和十四五世紀的手工業社會的交響樂，即出現在莫理思的心眼中的未來社會，是機械和都會都消滅了的農業的手工業的自由樂園。一切的勞作者都是藝術家，一切的物品都是藝術品。這種小說，不消說是「空想」的，但它有着改造人類的積極的能動性在。</p>
<p>在世界大戰以後，社會的經濟狀態更加惡劣了。幾乎在地球的大部份土地上，都充塞着飢餓和死亡，病疫和苦困的幻影。特別是在受創最巨的德國，更表現的彰著。因此，小市民的智識分子都馱着沉重的社會的絕望，生出一種超現實的心理和希望。這時，空想小說極爲風　雷行。這種傾向，大體上都是一個共同的地方，即幻想在全人類絕滅後，由一部份特殊的殘餘的人們重新創出美麗的地上樂園。這是廿世紀初頭的小市民作家的「理想世界」。作爲這時候的空想小說的典型作品的，在德國有維爾納·　兹夫的「火夫」，在美国有辛克莱的「两千年」，在捷克斯拉夫有加列　·卓倍克的「人造的人」等等。</p>
<p>維爾納·謝茲夫的「火夫」，完全是戰後德國的小市民的「絕望　學」的表現。這小說敘述德國戰後被凡爾賽條約所束縛，但國民工業及技術却得到了空前的發達。有一個天才的技師發明了一種大型的潛水艇，可以在水中經過幾晝夜。在公　　潛水艇的下水時，有一日本敎　在席上　　世界立刻就要毀滅了，但人們都以爲他是狂人的瘋話。於是潛水艇下水了，一晝夜之後，天才的技師即　駛　港灣，但機械的螺旋給日本敎授拿去了，　艇的人都陷入於焦迫的絕望中。經過許多麻煩之後，日本敎授把螺旋歸還了，於是船才浮出水面。然而，地球上的一切的生物，都已經中了日本敎授的預言，完全死滅了！法國人，凡爾賽條約的作者，都死滅了！這些幸而得救的人們，這時方才感謝日本敎授，開始建設地上的新生活的工作</p>
<p>辛克萊的「兩千年」則是以美國爲背景的。表現在這部作品裏面的「哲學」，大體上也和維爾納·　茲夫的相似。他寫着北美洲的一個大富豪，有一座高聳入雲的樓房，有一架新式的神秘的飛機，還有一種足以全地上的生物的要素，以及一種少量即能飽腹多時的食品。當那種使萬物具亡的要素作用起來的時候，那個大富豪和他的家屬正坐在飛機上，所以沒有死滅了。他們回來的時候，就在這荒涼的地上經營起生活來，一向寄生的人們，現在都變成世界的建設者。他們由原始混沌的也滿狀態，經過封建時代，資本主義時代，終於達到了「共和國」的時代，不勞動即不得食的時代。</p>
<p>加列爾·卓倍克的「人造的人」，在結末處也宣告了人類的絕滅。當時捷克斯拉夫的小市民，受着匈牙利的進步運動的威嚇，不敢正規眞正的現實。所以把這種進步運動，全歸於絕亡的深淵中。但在這作品中，最後還宣言着自然的　美，和人間性的不减之力。總之，在卓倍克的作品裏面，也存在着要使歷史回還到人類有史以前的最初的狀態上，以及化人類社會的必然的抗爭爲宗敎的無抵抗的道德。</p>
<p>此外，把古典的空想小說保持得最完全的，是瑞典作家莫多事，　　·愛托卡。他有一部自稱爲「現代的未來小說」的空想作品「太陽之　」，描寫將來的世界分爲五國，由五十個「庶維益」去支配。他的理想是「肉體，理性，和精的三位一體」。將來的人都是「莫多事主義者」。所謂「莫多事主義者」就是盡量地把人類固有的積極性——力與意志——「同化於大事業」的。他的這種理想，是威爾遜式的民主主義及現代都市知識分子的空想，以至於基爾特的小經營之折衷的混合物。</p>
<p>社會的空想小說，在新文學中又有略爲不同的表現。我們可以把傑克倫敦的「鐵　　來作爲典型的空想小說而觀察。</p>
<p>這種新的空想小說，和以前的空想小說的傳統差別，最主要的是在於不消滅社會的鬥爭這一點上。像上面所敘述過的一樣，過去的空想作家都是以技術的發達和人間倫理的破壞來使人類滅亡，然而再建設起「自由的樂園」來的。這種思想，在新文學的空想小說，完全被揚　了。這在傑克倫敦的「鐵　」表現得最明顯。在這作品中，社會的鬥爭是以抽象的空想的形式被描寫着的。傑克倫敦的這部「鐵　」，幾乎是完全用新經濟學，即說明並改革現制度的經濟學去做骨子的。在形式上幾乎是一種宣傳的紙品。這種作品的形式，即半空想半幻想的形式，主要的是因爲作者沒有深刻地理解現實，他的主觀性（例如傑克倫敦本來是個個人主義者和浪漫主義者）和他在理論上所認識的東西相矛盾，所以他不能在更具體的形象上去描寫社會的鬥爭；只能在空想的抽象的形式上去描寫</p>
<p>在我國，像上面所說的空想小說，還沒有見到。「鬼土日記」「貓城記」等類的作品，在形式上雖然是採取了空想小說，但內容主要是諷刺小說。當然，在這些作品中，我們也不能把握到藝術的具體的現實認識，雖然在部份上也有其成就的地方。這是和「加利略遊記」的血統有關的空想的諷刺小說。</p>
<p>據瑪察的分析，這種空想小說對于新文學是沒有用途的。因爲在其中隱藏人類「本性」之絕對性與不變性。</p>
<p>站在現實主義的新世界觀上，當然，這種主觀主義的創作方法是應該揚棄的。但如果說這種空想小說對于我們一點用途也沒有，却是太過籠統的說法。我們所揚棄的主要的是空想小說家的認識現實的方面。我們要創造新的有「空想」的作品，這種作品是吻合於現實的發展的新的「烏托邦小說」。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3 id="c195">從「猶太人飯店」說起 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>種族觀念一天不破除，人類間的糾紛，也一天難以消滅。像德國的排斥猶太人，眞是無所不用其極！德國自國社黨執政以還，對於居住德國境內的猶太人，一排再排。猶太人所受德國人的壓迫和侮辱，痛苦實不堪言。然而這有什麼法子呢？在强暴的高壓下，弱者是只能吞聲忍氣的。何况猶太人還是亡了祖國的可憐人呵！</p>
<p>而今不是又看到了一决侮辱嗎？德國哈諾佛城，最近新開設一所飯店，那是專供猶太人就膳之用的。因爲自紐倫堡法律實施以後，猶太人的家庭，極不容易雇用僕役。舉凡菜館的購買和烹調，都須親自操勞，甚感不便。故官廳乃有這種設施，以資補救。不過這所飯店，却不准亞里安種人入內。德國禁止亞里安種人和猶太人結婚，是早經法律規定實行了。現在連飯店也不許亞里安種人和猶太人同食，這種種族差別待遇，實極盡侮辱之能事！</p>
<p>然而侮辱又要怎樣呢？德國人是自稱爲上帝的選民，是人類中最優秀份子。猶太人，不消說是劣種。劣種人怎配和優秀份子平等？而况猶太人在德國人眼中看來，還是社會上犯罪最多的壞人。先前有一個德國警察司令，曾作過報吿，說就德國犯罪統計而觀，犯罪之事，以猶太人爲最高。那末猶大人之受德國人鄙視，自屬當然的事了。並且希特勒也說過，猶太人寄居德國，儼同食毛踐土，而對於主人，竟不知感激，馴至忘其所以，作惡為非。這就更不可恕了！</p>
<p>不過種族受悔辱的，又豈只猶太人而已。其實這種悔辱，一定要說是起因於種族的差別，也是不對的。倒不如認爲是國家强弱的關係。猶太人因爲亡了國，故有人欺侮他們。中國因爲國際地位低落，故有人欺侮我們。不見日本也是黃種人，然而待我們是怎樣呢。</p>
<h3 id="c196">沒有色彩的街 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 家人</p>
<p>它雖然亦是一條街，可並沒有通常的街所有的色彩，它的姿態是特別的。允其是缺少近代式精緻的建築物大百貨商店富麗的陳飾窗，以及勁然飄搖在半空上各種紅紅綠綠的廣吿布幅，爲街披着面更燦爛的袍褂，妝飾着這些人工傑作的街，於是顯出異樣的華美了。就是在街上走着的人，模樣兒也還在挺閒適的，拖著迂緩的步調，一邊走一邊悠雅」流覽街間的景物。</p>
<p>這一切，它完全不相同——一條沒有色彩的街。</p>
<p>窄狹的，走道是崎嶇的碎石子合沙土舖成，雨一下來，水沈浸着，沙士溶散，石子却高高露出來，到處是窟窿，路簡直變成泥沼了。每逢這種時候，我打從這要經過，雖是不怎樣長遠的脚程，但往往要走上半天，一面揀石子的地方落脚步，一面得留神它的滑溜，當心跌交，等到走過這條街，鞋子已塗滿汚泥。於是我不禁下意識對它憎惡起來——一條要不得的街。可是一條要不得的街，我每天總是往返着，至少有兩决的時候。因爲這樣，居住在街上的人們，和街的情形，日子一久，便漸漸瞧得狠熟悉了。</p>
<p>每次走過，差不多都可以聽到女人咒駡男人，或慣打孩子，或孩子們自夥洵裏互相揪打，啼哭，各樣嘈雜的聲音。假如停了足，多觀望一下子，就常有一更精彩的活劇出現於眼前：</p>
<p>也許是在早上，一個女人從低矮的木板屋子奔到街上，頭髮亦沒理好，亂蓬蓬地披散到額際間，衣襟的鈕扣竟忘記扣全，裸出雪白的一角胸脯來，</p>
<p>——天呀，我屋後鷄籠裏兩隻正在生蛋子的鷄忽然不見了。準是那短命賭鬼三喜子偸了去，</p>
<p>她這麼一邊跳，一邊嚷，一邊洶洶地直走進隔壁三喜子的屋裏，跟他要回偷去的鷄。</p>
<p>於是人圍攏在尾外，七嘴八舌的說這說那。</p>
<p>若是彼此都不認錯，接着便起了一陣鬥嘴，毒咒的擾亂，而依然不能完結，則將引出兩家的男人出場，說不定是女人鬧開的了，終局卻由男人的動武，弄得不能收拾，方了事。</p>
<p>三喜子到底是不是眞的偸了他家的鷄，沒人瞥見，當然也沒證據，但鄰居的人都是同情於被偸者，爲了三喜子的確是壞傢伙，街上有名的，誰都小覷他，何况他壯個子，不想找活計，却儘白相，吊兒哴噹過日子，兼拼命賭錢，可是他沒一個銅子入息，錢打那兒來的？因此，祇敎誰家掉了東西，卽使不是三喜子那傢伙的份，人亦一定疑心到是他合夥幹的。在街上，一同放蕩殺野的不止三喜子一個人。這種人，大家是瞧不上眼的。</p>
<p>在這上面，我不時發見了人的最眞摯的情感的表現，善與惡的分界綫。</p>
<p>而他們被生活趕着，却絲毫不覺疲倦，——也許是神經麻木了。除了幾個不守分的人，爲大家在一塊談話時候，加以一種惋惜或嘅嘆。誰都認眞，勇敢地迎着生活揚起來的鞭子，整年月無休止的勞碌着。在骯髒的街上，住着陰暗的，破舊的，鴿子籠一樣木房子，十分安寗，一點兒沒有其他的奢求。</p>
<p>但對於它的混亂，騷雜，我始終是厭惡着，而他們都狠習慣了。特別令人氣悶的是：在晴天，打這裏走過，頸上老是架着密密的竹竿子，亂七八糟地撩滿了新洗後的破碎衣衫，有女人的短褲，孩子的尿布，像在開空中圖畫展覽，水一串串滴下，會滴在頸髮上，臉上，而自己唯好認晦氣而已：</p>
<p>一條沒有色彩的街！</p>

<p>法外長佛蘭亭說，「若使有一德兵駐紮萊茵，便說不上談判，」德政府表示「萊茵退兵絕對談不到」若德軍再退出萊茵，則海國丟不下臉子，德軍若不退出萊茵，則法國丟不下臉子，眞是釘頭碰着鐵頭，有些尶尬，現在且看楊家勸的英國如何。</p>

<p>娜拉：那麼請你到他書室裏去坐罷</p>
<p>幾天他是患着頭痛的病，飯已經不如平常吃　那樣多了。他每天是沉在憂鬱的煩惱　　對於自己的工作沒有得到一點興趣。然而他知道這是生活。偶而想到他在沒有得這個小的職業之前那個飢餓，窮困，與不安的陰影，於是他反戚到心滿意足了。可是及至知道他每月把所得的二十塊錢的代價拿回家，他絕望似的往往要用手猛力握着那二十元鈔票，用着怒意凝視着發暗的天花板，半天沒有說一句話。這時他正在想他沒有法子讓他的妻，他的孩子，度着一個平安歡心的日子。漸漸的，他的眼前飛滿了一些散亂的無影的黑影了。</p>
<p>算來他進鐵路已經快快三個月了。在這個凄陰的季候里，他的心眞被冬天的寒氣吹冷了。風天，雪天，雨天，他的影子幽靈似的，悲哀地從車站走回家，又從家走到車站。有時，當夜深時分，他踏出了車站，在死寂的冷落的大街上往家走，或者穿過了黑暗的牆角時，那眞會使人疑心他是一個無家的夜的流浪者。更有時，當他一個整夜的工作，面在早晨五點三十分下班回家時在路上他的眼已經發花了，所看到的東西，像是一串紅色的，黑色的交織的數目似的。他只是低着頭往前走。他的腦袋深縮在大衣領里。及至走進了時堂，從腰袋里摸出鑰匙來把門開好爬上樓，又呌開了自己的門，他悄悄的無精打采的跳上了床，沒有幾分鐘他猶如一個死人，靜靜的安然的睡去了。</p>
<p>今天，當他剛踏進自己屋里，他看見那個一隻眼的女二房束正在和妻嚕囌什麼。經他一問，才知道她是跟他們討房租。他沒有用溫和的態度，張口就是蠻理蠻氣地…「…難道說我們能欠下你的嗎？今天才到期，你就跑上來要…我們明天搬家，搬家…」</p>
<p>二房東沒趣的笑了笑，說了幾句客氣話，便走了。</p>
<p>妻一邊收拾桌子要吃飯，一邊問：「不是今天領薪嗎？」</p>
<p>他沉默了一回，從桌子上端起了飯盌，便：「已經來發過了，我沒有領。明天我到會計處……」</p>
<p>妻沒有再問他。然而他把筷子豎起來往桌子上一使勁，生氣似的說：「這個　倒霉？只能拿到十五大　　。」</p>
<p>「爲什麼呢？」</p>
<p>「賠上了，打行李票，算錯了賬。」</p>
<p>妻幾乎跳起來，沉着臉　呶：「呵呀，不要命的幹一個月，這麼點小事還賠錢，有什麼意思：」</p>
<p>這個月怎樣生活呢？他默默的想，漸漸的，漸漸的，他的眼前又飛滿了一些散亂的無影的黑影子。</p>

<p>Grand Commemorative Meetings Held in Various Locations</p>
<p>Nanjing: At 8:00 AM on the 12th, the Central Committee and the National Government jointly held a memorial meeting in front of the Premier's Mausoleum to commemorate the 11th anniversary of the Premier's death. Present were Central Committee Vice Chairman Chiang, National Government Chairman Lin, Central Committee members Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Ye Chucang, Sun Ke, Feng Yuxiang, Kong Xiangxi, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Qin Zhen, Zhang Zhizhong, Gu Zhenglun, Gu Zhenggang, Chen Gongbo, Li Liejun, Cheng Qian, Zhang Ji, Wu Jingheng, Hong Lanyou, Xu Enzeng, Jing Hengyi, Xiao Tongzi, Zhou Qigang, Li Wenfan, Maksud, Shao Hua, Miao Peicheng, Shao Yuanchong, and Hui Kuoqing, totaling over eighty individuals. All department heads and above from the Central Party Headquarters, Grade 9 civil officials and above from the various Yuan, ministries, and commissions of the National Government, officers of the rank of Colonel and above, as well as all students from various classes, teams, and departments of the Central Military Academy, all officers and soldiers of the Training Corps, and all students of the Central Political Academy, stood in formation on the stone steps in front of the sacrificial hall. The lines were very orderly, with an estimated eight to nine thousand people. Central Committee members stood in shifts inside the sacrificial hall. At exactly 8:00 AM, the meeting commenced with music. Chairman Lin led the attendees in performing the ritual, and wreaths from the Central Executive Committee and Supervisory Committee were offered. After a moment of silence, Dai Chuanxian delivered a report, stating that when the Premier went north from Guangdong thirteen years ago, it held great significance and aspirations. We should all earnestly recognize this significance and these aspirations, which can be seen in the Premier's discussions with the press when he passed through Shanghai that year and in his public speech when he passed through Kobe. These two publicly expressed opinions were the Premier's last words. In summary, the Premier's propositions can be divided into two aspects: the first is for the world, advocating the implementation of the Kingly Way and peace to seek lasting happiness for mankind; the second is for the country, calling for unity from top to bottom to save the nation from peril. Therefore, at that time, he did not hesitate to compromise and went north resolutely to discuss national affairs with responsible leaders in the north, exhausting his final efforts. Unfortunately, he fell ill and passed away shortly after arriving in Beijing. Today, as we commemorate the Premier's death, we should inherit his legacy and bear the responsibility of national reconstruction. After Dai finished speaking, all Central Committee members, led by the chairman, entered the mausoleum in single file to pay their respects to the Premier's remains. They returned to their positions after twenty minutes, and the ceremony concluded. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The Central Party Headquarters and the National Government jointly held a Premier's death anniversary memorial meeting on the morning of the 12th. The main points of Dai Chuanxian's report are as follows: Fellow comrades, today is the eleventh anniversary of the Premier's death. On this day in the fourteenth year of the Republic, around this time, the sorrowful state of many comrades around the Premier's sickroom in Beijing (formerly Peking) is still vivid in my mind. Today, as we commemorate the Premier's death, everyone should feel the weight of their responsibility even more, which is how we can fulfill the Premier's lifelong aspirations. As for the Premier's aspirations, they are clearly expressed in his writings and deeds and are well understood by all comrades. There is naturally no need to report them again today. On this day of commemorating the Premier's death, I particularly want to remind everyone of the Premier's aspirations when he went north. When the Premier left Guangdong in November of the thirteenth year of the Republic, passing through Shanghai and Japan to Beijing, his aspirations were, simply put, to govern the country and bring peace to the world. On the eve of his departure from Shanghai, the Premier expressed his views to Shanghai journalists, earnestly advising the compatriots to unite. After arriving in Beijing, he personally met with the political and military leaders of the time, shaking hands with them. The reason for this painstaking effort was that he saw the perilous state of the world and the internal disorder and weakness of China at its extreme. In such a world, if the Chinese people did not quickly awaken and unite to complete the construction of the Republic of China through peaceful means and promote the realization of the Three Principles of the People, China's future would certainly be very dangerous. At that time, the people of the whole country also greatly supported the Premier's proposals. Therefore, at that time, the Premier held many telegrams from people's organizations across the country supporting his proposal to convene a National Assembly and resolve all national affairs through peaceful means. He said to Shanghai journalists that this force was stronger than a million soldiers, and as long as the universities could awaken, China could immediately achieve peace and unity and move towards prosperity and strength, and the future would certainly be bright. The Premier's words often enter our minds very deeply. After leaving Shanghai, the Premier first went to Kobe, Japan. At Kobe Higher Girls' School, he gave a large public lecture. The audience, both indoors and outdoors, totaled tens of thousands. At this time, the Premier clearly explained the dangers of the era. The nation-building and governing policies of imperialist countries were disrupting the world and harming the happiness of mankind, which was contrary to China's inherent peaceful policies of the Kingly Way. If the people of the world wanted to achieve happiness, they must reject the civilization of hegemony and strive for the civilization of the Kingly Way. This lecture was the Premier's last major public lecture. On the same night, at the hotel where the Premier was staying, there was another dinner party. The people at the table were all overseas Chinese comrades and old Japanese friends who had studied in Japan, with a total of no more than a hundred people. At this dinner, the Premier gave another most poignant speech. The Premier himself almost shed tears, and no one who listened did not weep. This speech fully expressed the Premier's benevolent spirit of loving China and the people of the world. Although this speech is also recorded in the complete works of the Premier, what is recorded is only the text. The Premier's lofty, great, and benevolent spirit at the time cannot be expressed even in one-tenth of it. This speech was also the Premier's last farewell to the people of the world, hoping that all countries in the world would voluntarily tear up the unequal treaties that oppressed China, especially hoping that our neighbor Japan, the Premier said that China and Japan were like brothers, closely related. Japan should be especially sympathetic to China's current environment. If all countries in the world cannot abandon the sins of the civilization of hegemony and embark on the path of the civilization of the peaceful Kingly Way, the result will not only harm the weak and small nations, but all powerful and tyrannical nations and states will themselves suffer infinite disasters. The Premier has been dead for eleven years, but the Premier's spirit will forever remain in the spirit of the people of the world. I believe that all countries and nations in the world will eventually awaken. The Blue Sky with a White Sun will eventually achieve lasting victory. We very much hope that the strong countries of the world will quickly awaken and not force all the people of the world onto a path of mutual killing with no results. From the Premier's talks and lectures in Shanghai and Kobe, we can know that although the Premier had made the determination to launch the Northern Expedition and the determination that the revolutionary army would start the revolution and the revolutionary party would succeed, he still held the most compassionate heart and worked hard for peace both domestically and internationally. Domestically, he sincerely shook hands with the leaders in charge of political affairs and military affairs in Beijing and Tianjin, hoping that everyone would sincerely support the Three Principles of the People, implement the Three Principles of the People, and sincerely revive China and build the Republic of China. This is a major fact of the Premier going north to govern the country and going north for the world. Originally, the Premier's plan at that time was to stay in Beijing and Tianjin for at most one or two months, and use these one or two months of effort to achieve the goal of peaceful unification of China. The next step was to travel to Russia via Siberia, then to re-travel to various European countries from Russia, and then to the United States to proclaim the Three Principles of the People to all the people in the world, awakening the world from the cruel dream of suicide and killing, so that all the people of the world could jointly reach the great unity goal of peaceful development of all nations on the path of the Three Principles of the People. Although this great aspiration was not achieved by the Premier himself, we must believe that this is the only right path for the people of the world. Those who do not awaken will only harm themselves and others. All their attempts will eventually be a nightmare. The crisis in the world today is becoming more and more urgent, which makes us believe more and more in the Premier's ideology and the Premier's last efforts for the ideology, his benevolent and great. The revival of China is determined to be conceived from the Premier's benevolent spirit. The peace of the world and the happiness of all countries are determined to be realized only after all people understand the Three Principles of the People and believe in and practice the Three Principles of the People. We hope that all comrades and compatriots will continue to make the greatest efforts and the most solid unity to prove the Premier's ideology, to guarantee the unification and revival of China, and to be the pioneers of world peace. Finally, I will conclude with two sentences: "Governing the country is the foundation of bringing peace to the world, and bringing peace to the world is the essential element of the spirit of governing the country."

<p>Nanjing: Considering the 12th as the anniversary of the Premier's death, Sun Ke not only dispatched legislator Zhu Hezhong to attend the Legislative Yuan's memorial meeting to report, but also led his family to the mausoleum in the morning to pay their respects.

(Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The Ministry of Finance held a memorial meeting for the anniversary of the Premier's death on the morning of the 12th. Kong Xiangxi gave a detailed report on the historical facts of the Premier's northward journey, stating that the Premier went north that year because Feng Huanzhang contacted comrades to launch an uprising in the north, welcoming him to the north to preside over the overall plan. The reason why Feng advocated the uprising was that Yu, upon the Premier's orders, presented Feng with a handwritten outline of national construction, which moved Feng. When the Premier went north, Yu was ordered to make contact in Qingdao, and then transferred from Tianjin to Beijing. When the Premier fell ill, Yu attended to him day and night, and he passed away not long after. Yu was entrusted by his comrades to take charge of the funeral arrangements. Reflecting on the past, he could not help but feel particularly emotional, and then described the Premier's thoughts and aspirations, and encouraged all members to deeply understand and practice them, and finally encouraged his colleagues to strictly abide by President Chiang's instructions to cultivate integrity and serve the public selflessly.

<h3 id="e2">Grand Tree Planting Ceremony in the Capital <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: The Capital Afforestation Movement Committee held a tree planting ceremony at Jinzigang, 35 miles from the city, at 2:00 PM on the 12th to commemorate the 11th anniversary of the Premier's death. Despite the spring rain, the participants were still very enthusiastic. Chairman Lin of the National Government, Vice Chairman Chiang of the Central Committee and his wife Soong Mei-ling, Dai Chuanxian, Wu Dingchang, Chen Shaokuan, Cao Haosen, Chiang Tingfu, Xu Chonghao, Xu Chongqing, Ma Honghuan, Zhang Lisheng, Luo Jialun, and representatives from various agencies, schools, party headquarters, civil organizations, and soldiers of the Training Corps, totaling more than a thousand people, attended. After Chairman Wu Dingchang led the attendees in performing the ritual and delivered the opening remarks, Chiang and Lin delivered speeches. After the ceremony, the entire group went to the forest to plant trees. The forest area was approximately 35 acres, and Lin, Chiang, Dai, and others personally planted a cypress seedling, and a stone tablet was erected to commemorate it. A total of 8,000 seedlings were planted. In his opening remarks, Wu Dingchang stated that since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the tree planting movement has expanded year by year, which is the most gratifying thing in the process of economic construction. According to statistics, this year's capital tree planting covers a total of 167,000 acres and 6,543,000 trees, which is the largest record since the capital began the afforestation movement since the establishment of Tree Planting Day. In addition to the capital, the Ministry also telegraphed the administrative organs of various provinces and highway agencies in advance, limiting them to carry out afforestation movements during the Tree Planting Day period. Replies have been received one after another, and they are proceeding unanimously. The Ministry has further proposed a Northwest afforestation plan, intending to integrate the five provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, and conduct a comprehensive design according to the mountains and rivers, and cooperate with the five provinces. The five provinces have a vast area, and there are countless abandoned lands between the mountains and rivers, which are suitable for large-scale afforestation. It is expected that the afforestation movement will progress with each year, in order to offer our great Premier as a permanent souvenir. In his speech, Vice Chairman Chiang said that China has a vast territory, and not only are the underground resources extremely rich, but also treasures can be found everywhere on the ground. For example, if everyone plants a tree every year, there will be 400 million trees in ten years, which will increase the country's endless wealth. Afforestation can prevent floods and droughts, and the benefits are endless. Therefore, we must develop the habit of planting trees. Moreover, afforestation is easy to do. In the future, everyone should persuade friends, relatives, and the general public to plant trees, at least two trees per person per year. Chairman Lin said in his speech that we use trees in many places every day, from small things like matches and toothpicks to large things like boats, vehicles, houses, gun stocks, sleepers, tables, and chairs. There is nothing that does not require trees. We only know how to use them, but we don't know how to accumulate them, which is really disrespectful to those who plant trees. Moreover, China uses foreign pine trees every year, and we don't know how much we spend. Afforestation can also prevent floods and droughts and can enrich the country, so it must be strongly promoted. On the one hand, we must also protect the forests. If everyone plants a tree every year, we can increase the country's endless wealth in ten years. Today is the 11th anniversary of the Premier's death. We commemorate the Premier by planting trees, which contains a permanent and infinite meaning. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>— Editor-in-Chief of the Science Society of China, Xingcun</p>
<p>The Reproduction and Development of Insects (Part 1)</p>
<p>The number of insect species accounts for more than 70% of the entire animal kingdom. Not only are there a vast number of species, but the number of individuals within each species is sometimes astonishing. Therefore, insects are always in conflict of interest with humans. Locusts and borers damage agricultural crops in our country, causing losses of tens of millions of dollars each year. I believe everyone is very familiar with the reproduction and development of insects. Understanding this is essential not only for those studying agriculture but also for general nature lovers, as it is a fascinating issue. This is the motivation behind my writing this article.</p>
<p>Methods of Insect Reproduction. In terms of reproductive capacity, some insects can reproduce, such as locusts and most other insects, while others cannot. For example, in termite colonies, only the queen termite has the ability to lay eggs. Usually, soldier termites and queen termites cannot reproduce. In terms of fertilization, some insects reproduce sexually, where females and males mate and fertilize eggs for reproduction, which is the case for most insects. Others reproduce parthenogenetically, where the female does not need to mate or be fertilized by a male to produce offspring, such as aphids (but aphids do not always reproduce parthenogenetically; they also mate and fertilize eggs at certain times of the year) and honeybees (fertilized eggs laid by the queen bee develop into female bees, while unfertilized eggs develop into male bees). In terms of the form of offspring when they leave the mother's body, there is a distinction between oviparous and viviparous. Oviparous means that when the offspring leaves the mother's body, it is still in the egg stage and will hatch into larvae in the external environment. Most insects are oviparous. Viviparous means that when the offspring leaves the mother's body, it is no longer in the egg stage but is already a hatched larva, such as some aphids and flesh flies (commonly known as blowflies), which exhibit viviparity.</p>
<p>The Position Where Insects Lay Eggs. The position where insects lay eggs varies depending on the species. Here are a few examples to represent various different oviposition locations. For example, moths usually lay eggs on the surface of plants, locusts lay eggs in the soil, cicadas lay eggs inside tree branches, and a few flies lay eggs in the tissues of leaves. Parasitic insects (insects that parasitize other insects to obtain nutrients are called parasitic insects) lay eggs on the bodies of other insects, and dragonflies lay eggs in the water. The most remarkable aspect of insect oviposition habits is that insects can naturally lay eggs on their required host (plant or animal), making it easy for the larvae to obtain the necessary food after hatching. Therefore, the selection of oviposition sites by insects is very accurate.</p>
<p>The Reproductive Capacity of Insects. The reproductive capacity of insects varies depending on the species. For example, a horse botfly lays only one egg at a time, but the queen bee in a honeybee colony can lay up to 1,500,000 eggs in her lifetime. Professor Huxley once conducted a very interesting and astonishing statistic on the reproductive capacity of aphids. According to Huxley's calculation, if we start with only one aphid, whose lifespan is 20 days, and this aphid can produce 20 small aphids in its lifetime, then after 300 days, the number of individuals obtained from the descendants of this aphid through generations of reproduction can increase to 327,680,000,000,000,000,000. Assuming that the total weight of 1,000 aphids is one grain (one grain = 0.0648 grams), and assuming that the weight of a person is 2,000,000 grains, then the weight of a person is equivalent to the total weight of 2,000,000,000 aphids. Dividing 327,680,000,000,000,000,000 by 2,000,000,000 yields a quotient of 163,840,000. This means that the total weight of the individuals obtained from the reproduction of one aphid in one year is equivalent to the total weight of 163,840,000 people. This number is several times higher than the population of any populous country in the world. Some parasitic wasps, which specialize in parasitic life in the insect world, have a special method of development to increase the number of individuals. This method is called polyembryony. What is polyembryony? Usually, one fertilized egg only develops into one individual. If the embryo exhibits polyembryony during development, then one fertilized egg can develop into more than one individual.</p>
<p>Changes in the Shape of Insects During Development. Ancient books said, "Rotten grass turns into fireflies," meaning that summer fireflies are transformed from rotten grass. In the past, some people believed that fish eggs or shrimp could turn into locusts, and fabricated the so-called "transformation theory." In fact, these words are all incorrect. Rotten grass will not turn into fireflies, and fish eggs and shrimp will not turn into locusts. Only the offspring of fireflies will turn into fireflies, and only the offspring of locusts will turn into locusts. People in the past had these misunderstandings because they did not understand the development of insects. When we talk about the development of insects, the first thing we notice is that the body shape of insects undergoes considerable changes during development. This change is called metamorphosis. (A very small number of insects do not change their shape during development.) Have you seen locusts? The eggs laid by locusts (locust eggs are in clumps in the soil, each clump containing many eggs) hatch into small locusts (commonly known as nymphs). From the nymph stage to the flying locust stage, the body shape clearly undergoes changes, because the body of the nymph is smaller than that of the flying locust, and the wings are initially very small. As development progresses closer to the flying locust stage, the wings become larger. The reproductive organs of the nymph are not yet mature, while the flying locust has developed reproductive organs. In addition, there is another type of insect whose body shape changes more significantly during development. We can use silkworms as a representative. Silkworm eggs hatch into silkworms. Silkworms do not have wings, have true legs on the thorax, and have prolegs on the abdomen. They use chewing mouthparts to eat mulberry leaves. When silkworm larvae develop to a certain extent, they undergo the first shape change and reach the pupa stage. The shape of the pupa gradually approaches that of the silkworm moth, but it remains still. When the pupa transforms into a silkworm moth, it undergoes the second shape change. The shapes of the silkworm moth and silkworm larva are completely different. The silkworm moth has wings and thoracic legs, antennae, etc., but no prolegs, and has sucking mouthparts, so it cannot eat mulberry leaves. Since the lifestyles of silkworm larvae and silkworm moths are different, the body structure of the larva stage is not suitable for the moth stage. Therefore, it must undergo a change, and the static pupa stage is the transitional period for this change.</p>

<h3 id="e21">The Problem of Tax Evasion and Smuggling in North China <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— Rui</p>
<p>In recent years, Japanese and Korean ruffians in North China, relying on the non-war zone as a protective shield and a powerful background, have openly organized smuggling groups to secretly transport foreign goods into the country. Occasionally, when exposed, they surround and assault customs officials, using force to plunder, rendering anti-smuggling authority unenforceable. The seriousness of this problem cannot be ignored. According to relevant statistics, smuggling losses in North China, in rayon alone, have reached more than 8 million yuan in recent months. The amount of other categories such as sugar, salt, and cosmetics must be even more considerable. During normal times, the income from salt and customs taxes in Hebei and Chahar, in addition to being allocated to the foreign debt principal and interest repayment fund, has surplus funds to supply the military and political expenses of Hebei and Chahar. Now, because of rampant smuggling, tax revenues have sharply decreased. If this continues, the payment of foreign debt principal and interest will certainly have problems. Moreover, because the prices of smuggled goods are surprisingly cheap and sales are brisk, not only will nascent domestic products suffer a fierce blow, but also European and American businesses in China will inevitably decline rapidly. Therefore, this problem also has international implications.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Northeast Incident, North China has suffered many misfortunes year after year, and most seaports are controlled by the Japanese military. The main reason why smuggling groups can proceed unimpeded is precisely this. During September and October last year, as the situation in North China was tense, the trend of smuggling became even more intense. Smugglers formed groups of three to five or seven to eight people, and resisted with force upon being discovered by customs officials. On September 7th of last year, customs officials in Qinhuangdao were surrounded and beaten by more than a hundred Japanese and Korean ruffians, resulting in seven seriously injured and two slightly injured. Subsequently, similar incidents have occurred from time to time. Customs anti-smuggling patrol boats are equipped with weapons, but when approaching seaports such as Qinhuangdao to suppress smuggling, they are often disarmed by the Japanese military police under the pretext of non-armed zones. Smuggled goods are protected by the military, so they can arrive at the seaports of North China and be landed with a 100% guarantee of safety. From this, we can see that smuggling in North China is not merely a simple profit-seeking issue, but a complete and planned action. Its intention may be to disrupt our customs administration, break down our tariff autonomy barriers, so as to restore the customs status under foreign management before 1929, or to use this as a threat to reduce import tariffs.</p>
<p>After the Executive Yuan ordered the Ministries of Finance and Railways to consult on effective measures to deal with smuggling in North China, the Beining and Jinpu Railway Bureaus were ordered to assist the customs in strictly suppressing smuggling. Finance Minister Kong also expressed yesterday that he intended to formulate concrete measures. However, according to our observations, it may be impossible to eradicate tax evasion and smuggling in North China as long as the puppet organization in eastern Hebei has not been abolished and the special zones still exist. What we can hope for during this transition period is that: 1. The government can find ways to gradually reduce smuggling, or at least not allow it to increase. 2. Outside the special zones, the customs and railway bureaus can each fulfill their inspection responsibilities to prevent smuggled goods from penetrating inland. 3. Neighboring countries can use strict measures to restrain Japanese and Korean ruffians and stop smuggling organizations, so that the commerce of both countries can return to normal. Tax evasion and smuggling also hinder the interests of legitimate Japanese merchants. As evidenced by a recent telegram stating that major Japanese trading houses in Tianjin, such as Mitsui and Mitsubishi, were deeply dissatisfied with the impact of smuggling in North China on legitimate commerce and requested Consul-General Kawagoe to assist our side in taking action. 4. Since the shortage of tax revenue in North China affects foreign debt credit, the governments of the relevant countries can provide us with assistance in various aspects so that our government's anti-smuggling policy in North China can be successful.</p>

<p>Tokyo. At the time of the February 26th Incident, some people provided information on the domestic situation to a certain embassy. The Foreign Affairs Division of the Metropolitan Police Department considered it inappropriate and immediately began operations. A few days ago, the translators of a certain embassy, Inoue Mitsuru, Kuroda Tatsuo, Ms. Nakayama Tatsuko, and eight others, were all reported and detained in various substations for serious investigation. These individuals, during the outbreak of this major incident, automatically collected various intelligence and provided it to a certain embassy, which was deemed to be suspected of violating the Public Security Preservation Law and the Military Secrets Protection Law. The investigation was immediately started. (12th, Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo. Recently, three Japanese people working as translators at the Russian Consulate General were detained by the Japanese police for providing news of the recent military coup in Tokyo to the Russian mission. Nine other Japanese people were also arrested for this reason. The Japanese side accused them of being communists. The Russian mission has protested.

<p>Adjusting the Previous Cabinet's Harmonious Diplomacy</p>
<p>Tokyo. The Hirota Cabinet's political program and policies will be formally announced soon. Regarding the foreign policy within it, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has carefully drafted it and is gradually finalizing it. It has been decided to submit it to the cabinet meeting for discussion on the 13th. Its spirit is that Japan is the only stabilizing force in East Asia. To achieve this great purpose, it is necessary to make independent and active adjustments to the harmonious diplomacy of the previous cabinet. The main points are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Political Sphere: Establishing stability in East Asia is an absolute requirement for promoting world peace. Under this conviction, the Japanese government should first correct the perceptions of various countries regarding East Asia. At the same time, in order to adjust the relations between China, Japan, Manchuria, and the Soviet Union, the best possible efforts must be made. (A) Japan, as the homeland of our East Asian policy and our allied country "Manchukuo," will devote the full strength of the nation to assisting it in achieving sound development. (B) Restore the relations between China, Japan, and Manchuria to the right track, in order to realize the cooperation and facilitate the establishment of stability in East Asia. In the same sense, adjust the relations between Japan, Manchukuo, and the Soviet Union, with "Manchukuo" as the center, and strive to eliminate the real causes of disputes.</p>
<p>Commercial Sphere: The various economic demands of the Japanese people must be met throughout the world. (A) Demand the opening of resource markets and free transportation. (B) Demand that various countries moderate or abolish the harsh tariff policies imposed on Japanese goods. (12th, Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo. According to the Jiji Shinbun, an opinion in political circles is gaining momentum, namely that in order to facilitate national mobilization in times of emergency, the cabinet should be reorganized according to the following guidelines: 1. Merge the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways into a Ministry of Transportation. 2. Merge the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Commerce into a Ministry of Industry. 3. Abolish the Ministry of Overseas Colonization. 4. Establish a Ministry of the Air Force and a Ministry of Propaganda. 5. Organize a large-scale "Headquarters Trust." (12th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Tokyo. As a result of Privy Council President Ichiki's resignation, it has been decided to promote Vice President Kiichiro Hiranuma to succeed him. Privy Council Advisor Kentaro Arai will be appointed as Vice President. Prime Minister Hirota entered the palace on the 12th to request the Emperor's approval, and the investiture ceremony was held immediately. (12th, Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo. Privy Council President Ichiki has formally expressed his intention to resign on the occasion of the establishment of the new cabinet. The issue of replacing the Privy Council members, which has been the center of profound discussion due to the National Essence Clarification issue, has also become concrete. Therefore, it will be decided today to appoint current Privy Council Vice President Kiichiro Hiranuma as the new Privy Council President, and an investiture ceremony will be held. When considering the appointment of the President, Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa and Chamberlain Matsudaira were extremely cautious because of the recent changes in important close officials and the connection with the subtle political situation. They also exchanged views with Prince Saionji. Therefore, there was talk of Count Kiyoura for a time, but the result was the appointment of Baron Hiranuma. As for the successor to Baron Hiranuma as Vice President, General Kawai Osamu and Kentaro Arai are more likely candidates. (12th, Dentsu News Agency Dispatch)</p>

All aircraft on the northern front are still very active. (12th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome. Regarding the progress of the Italian-Ethiopian war, informed sources here are keeping silent. As far as the general public knows, the Italian army on the northern route will soon continue its advance. As for the southern route, General Graziani, the Italian commander, is also planning to depart from Italian Somaliland and attack the Ethiopian army soon. General Graziani has now received many trucks to transport troops. However, the above news has not yet been confirmed. According to news from Asmara, a city in the Italian territory of Eritrea, High Commissioner for East Africa and Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force General Badoglio has returned to the city and is stationed at headquarters. The Duke of Bergamo (the King of Italy's nephew) has rushed to the front lines, and Duke Spaurato has also returned to his command of the Red Sea Fleet. (11th, Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Addis Ababa. According to confirmed information today, fifty Ethiopians died when the Italian army bombed Debre Markos. This may be a prelude to the resumption of the offensive on the southern route. At the same time, the lack of news from several British and American missionaries here has caused great concern. War reports released today state that five women and three children were killed and twenty-one women and twelve children were injured when the Italian army recently bombed Iga Alen.

<h3 id="e26">Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Pact Will Undoubtedly Pass the French Senate <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Paris – The approval proposal for the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Pact, having previously passed the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, has now had a report drafted by Committee Chairman de Trocquaux, submitted to the Senate, advocating for its ratification. The main reasons cited in the report are threefold: The Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Pact is, in fact, a step towards the “Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact,” which Germany may also join in the future. (The Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact was proposed by France in July 1934, advocating for its signing by Soviet Russia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany, and the Baltic coastal states.) The Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Pact does not conflict with the Locarno Pact, just as the Franco-Polish Defensive Alliance and the Franco-Czech Mutual Assistance Pact do not. After the establishment of the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Pact, if Czechoslovakia is attacked by another country, the obligations that France would bear according to the Franco-Czech Mutual Assistance Pact would be partially reduced because Russia and Czechoslovakia would already have a mutual pact.

<p>Vienna – The Nazi Party propaganda movement is reviving throughout Austria, especially noticeably after German Führer Adolf Hitler's speeches last Saturday and Sunday. The police department has arrested over thirty leaders of the party here and, in their residences, seized significant propaganda materials and numerous suspicious documents. Among those arrested, the most prominent is a former editor-in-chief of the Austrian German People's Newspaper, a major. The newspaper is the official organ of German Führer Hitler and was ordered to cease publication by the authorities two years ago. However, the editor-in-chief remained in Austria, overseeing everything on behalf of Hitler. Another, an Intermann, who formerly served as a cavalry battalion commander and is currently a Vienna correspondent for the Berlin Germanic People's Newspaper, is accused of being responsible for financial liaison between the central party headquarters of the German Nazi Party and the central party headquarters in Austria. In addition, the intelligence officer of the German envoy to Austria, Henry Riemann, who is currently ill, is also reportedly implicated and is being guarded by the police department in the hospital.

<p>Berlin – A leading figure in German industry recently gave an interview to our correspondent regarding the domestic economic situation, saying, "If the League of Nations were to impose economic sanctions on Germany, the impact on Germany would be extremely serious. Foreign currency is currently very scarce in the market, and foreign goods cannot be purchased. Therefore, the quantity of domestic inventory will inevitably decrease rapidly. If certain major food sources are cut off, our lives can only be sustained for a few days. Moreover, this year's grain imports have been severely depressed because grain purchases require cash payments, as can be seen from the recent report of the Deutsche Bank, which shows a shortage of cash. As for raw materials, if Soviet Russia were to implement sanctions against Germany, the manganese needed to refine special steel would be greatly lacking." Our correspondent also learned from reliable sources that Economic Minister Schacht and Foreign Minister Neurath strongly opposed Führer Hitler's abrupt move to abolish the Locarno Pact, suggesting that negotiations should be held with the relevant countries regarding the re-establishment of defenses in the Rhineland region. In addition, Defense Minister Blomberg stated firmly that Führer Hitler's decision might force Germany to take military action, a responsibility that was too great, and the defense forces were currently ill-equipped to handle it, so he also expressed his opposition. Those who supported Hitler's proposal included Aviation Minister General Göring, Propaganda Minister Goebbels, and Justice Minister Frank, all of whom advocate for a policy of authority. The above information has not been confirmed by well-informed sources, but they say that this news is old and does not need to be mentioned again. (Havas, 11th)</p>

<p>London – It is now generally acknowledged that France has inquired about Britain's opinion on economic sanctions against Germany and advocated for talks between the two countries' general staffs on the issue of assistance under the Locarno Pact. Although there is no final decision at present, diplomatic circles believe that Britain will propose a plan at today's meeting, the solution of which is the "symbolic" withdrawal of German troops from the Rhineland. British Foreign Secretary Eden and Lord Privy Seal Halifax both attended the Paris conference of signatory countries to the Locarno Pact. After returning to London last night, they went straight to the House of Commons and held a temporary cabinet meeting in the Prime Minister's office to consider the situation based on the results of the Paris talks. It is said that no resolution was reached, and another meeting is scheduled for this morning. It seems that the Paris talks failed to make progress due to France's firm attitude. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>London – Our correspondent reports exclusively that if one of the signatory countries to the Locarno Pact makes a strong argument regarding Germany's treaty abrogation, the League of Nations Council will undoubtedly accept it. France and Belgium are currently demanding, based on Article 4 of the Locarno Pact (i.e., if one of the contracting parties violates Article 2 of the pact or Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles, the other contracting parties should immediately assist the invaded country, etc.), that Britain and Italy, in their capacity as guarantors, immediately come forward to assist. It seems that the British government should issue a statement notifying Germany that the signatory countries to the Locarno Pact must wait until Germany withdraws its troops from the Rhineland region and demonstrates sincerity before beginning negotiations with it and concluding a new treaty, as it has proposed.

<p>Berlin – A lengthy communiqué was issued here today, stating Führer Hitler's peace proposals and the reasons for abrogating the Locarno Pact. If countries do not give this orderly consideration, Germany will abandon its peace efforts and instead isolate itself for self-defense. The statement said that the German government would rather choose honorable isolation than continue to be a discriminated nation within the community of nations. Before signing the Locarno Pact, France had concluded military alliances with Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and Poland and had amassed a large army along the border. The border had now become a huge bulwark. Germany initially had no objection to this, but the recent Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Agreement was actually farcical, as Soviet Russia had announced the imperialist program of aggression and now sought world revolution. France had the Locarno Pact and the Little Entente countries as guarantees of its security. In reality, Germany had never taken any action that could lead France to believe that it was harmful to France. Before concluding the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Agreement, France should have notified the signatory countries to the Locarno Pact, as the agreement stipulated that the decision on which country was the aggressor could be made without consulting the League of Nations Council and the signatory countries to the Locarno Pact. France now claimed that the nineteen battalions that Germany had sent into the Rhineland were a threat to French security, guaranteed by half the world. In fact, Germany only sent a small number of troops to occupy the Rhineland in order to avoid the impression that Germany was exerting pressure on France. Germany had also made a great contribution to European peace; otherwise, Germany could have withdrawn from all subsequent collective work and focused on developing its own strength. All Germany needed was honorable negotiations with France and Europe. Germany was prepared not to increase its troops stationed in the Rhineland during negotiations, but Belgium and France must adhere to the same attitude. In any case, Germany was unwilling to abandon any part of its sovereignty. Germany felt that this discrimination would leave seeds of disappointment in the future of European pacification. Germany would honorably adhere to pacification based on the free decisions of all European countries on an equal footing. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<p>London – French Foreign Minister Flandin led the delegation and arrived here last night at 11 p.m. at Victoria Station. Upon arriving at the hotel, he told reporters, "I am a loyal old friend of Britain, as you all know. I have expressed my support without hesitation for the transfer of the conference of signatory countries to the Locarno Pact from Paris to here, for that reason. I firmly believe that the representatives of the countries concerned will continue to meet here and will definitely achieve something. At this moment, the future of peace is at a critical juncture. France can only uphold its inherent claims, which is to seek a collective security system based on the League of Nations Covenant. British public opinion fully supports the League of Nations Covenant. I dare to ask British people to carefully examine the various articles of the Locarno Pact, so that they can accurately know the obligations stipulated in this pact. If we consider ourselves practical people, then the most obvious thing is to abide by the freely concluded treaties, because all international negotiations that promote lasting peace should be based on respecting treaties," he said. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>London – The rumor that France may withdraw from the League of Nations if it believes that the collective security treaty system is ineffective has been denied by Foreign Minister Flandin today. Someone asked Flandin whether it was true that the United States and other places were spreading the rumor that France would withdraw from the League of Nations if Britain could not support France's demand for the withdrawal of German troops from the Rhineland. Flandin replied, "This statement is extremely ridiculous and not true at all." (National Telegraph, 11th)</p>
<p>Paris – According to today's news, the highest political and military authorities in France have very different opinions on whether to take immediate military action against Germany. In the Congress and the Cabinet, many believe that war is unavoidable and that France should take preemptive action before Germany completes its rearmament. It is said that Prime Minister Sarraut, Foreign Minister Flandin, and Interior Minister Pengou all hold this view. However, the General Staff believes that France has nothing to worry about from Germany.

However, the Ministry of War denied that it would mobilize immediately, but said that there were currently 32,000 armed soldiers, and 500,000 more could be mobilized at any time, not including reservists. If the existing troops must be increased, it is not necessary to mobilize, but only to summon the border guard reserves and give them appropriate training.

Although the number of war hawks in the House of Representatives is still small, it is increasing at any time. The Communist Party and the radical leftists mostly advocate war, but although the Socialist Party hates Hitler, it does not advocate the use of force. There are also some moderates who believe that Germany's current financial and economic situation is extremely dangerous. If strict economic sanctions can be imposed, their effectiveness should not be less than that of military sanctions. The government, in view of the divergence of opinions in the House of Representatives, is now considering adjourning it in the middle of next week to cover it up. (National Telegraph, 11th)</p>

The meeting lasted for an hour, but no major decisions were made, as it wanted to wait for the results of the talks between British and French diplomats at the French Embassy this afternoon. The British cabinet has not set a date for the next meeting, but all cabinet members are prepared to meet at any time. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>London – Foreign Secretary Eden and Lord Privy Seal Halifax arrived here from Paris this morning. The cabinet immediately convened a meeting at 5:30 p.m. to hear reports from Eden and Halifax on the conference of signatory countries to the Locarno Pact in Paris. According to the Foreign Office, after hearing the report, the cabinet was quite shocked by the attitude adopted by France, and at the same time, it became more aware of the critical state of the situation. The Foreign Office believes that at this moment, Führer Hitler should be made aware of the need to rein in the horse before the precipice, so as to ease the current situation, and then a way can be found to start negotiations. Although there is currently no concrete proposal on this matter, most people advocate that Germany should withdraw some of its troops stationed in the Rhineland Province and promise not to set up fortifications along the Rhine River. If Germany is unwilling to make concessions automatically, then Britain, France, Belgium, and Italy may jointly uphold the Locarno Pact regardless of Germany's treaty abrogation and exert spiritual pressure on Germany, or even take a further step and have the countries concerned conclude a military agreement, which is also possible. It is reported that the cabinet was quite concerned that the Soviet Union, the Little Entente, and the Balkan Entente countries all expressed support for the stance adopted by France. However, British public opinion advocates adopting a compromise and opposes imposing pressure or sanctions on Germany, which is enough to hinder the cabinet's actions. (Havas, 11th)</p>

In addition, the general public believes that Britain's attitude is becoming tougher because its Foreign Secretary Eden and Lord Privy Seal Halifax were deeply impressed during the Paris conference the day before yesterday. At that time, the delegations from France and Belgium, especially the arguments made by Belgian Prime Minister Janson, were all strong and powerful.

<p>London – According to Reuters diplomatic correspondent, there is credible reason to believe that various countries have instructed their ambassadors to France to declare to the French government that they are willing to cooperate with France in the current political situation in exchange for France's guarantee to use its influence to ensure that the solution to the Albanian issue is acceptable to Italy. This move by Italy may not imply that Italy can support the implementation of sanctions against Germany, but it seems to say that France will support a plan similar to that previously proposed by Hoare and Laval to resolve the Italian-Albanian war. It is believed that France, in view of the crisis caused by Germany, will advocate for the termination of sanctions against Italy. Italian Ambassador to Britain Grandi, who will represent Italy at the London talks, will declare at the meeting that Italy can only cooperate with the Stresa Front if the sanctions against Italy are terminated.

<p>London – The opinions of the Council members of the League of Nations can be divided into two factions: one faction supports France and does not want to inflict a major diplomatic blow on Hitler; the other faction advocates negotiations as long as Germany has not taken any act of war against France and Belgium. The countries belonging to the first faction are currently considering whether to propose in advance the condition that German troops are not allowed to remain in the Rhineland.

<p>Brussels: Prime Minister Janson, in his speech to the Chamber of Representatives today, used fervent language regarding Germany's abandonment of the Locarno Pact, urging everyone to remain calm, use common sense, and make rational decisions to protect children from the horrors faced by modern people. He stated that Germany's excuse was the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, which has nothing to do with Belgium. There is no political agreement or military obligation between France and Belgium. People have always believed that international organizations should not be based on violence but should be founded on agreements. This belief has now been shattered by Germany's actions, and it may take generations to recover, which is truly regrettable. He feels that if the signatories of the Locarno Pact can unite and take collective action, then we can escape danger; otherwise, the world may face dire consequences. Belgium is ready to participate in any collective action, agreeing to cooperate with France and Britain. At the same time, Belgium will uphold the Locarno Pact until a new one replaces it. (Reuter's dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Brussels: Janson continued, stating that Belgium's border with neighboring countries is longest with Germany, and the area is a plain with no natural defenses. Therefore, Germany's re-establishment of defenses in the Rhineland area seriously endangers Belgium's security. As for Germany's abandonment of the Locarno Pact, it is also groundless as far as Belgium is concerned, because Belgium was not a signatory to the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact. Janson then read out the recent military agreement between the French and Belgian general staffs, stating that Belgium's security depends on this agreement. Back in 1920, France and Belgium originally had a military agreement that applied to the situation arising from the Allied occupation of the Rhineland after the European War. Now, times have changed, and the old agreement is no longer practical. Therefore, the French and Belgian general staffs have revised a new one to replace the old one. Its purpose is to maintain close contact between the two general staffs so that they can fulfill the obligations stipulated in the mutual assistance clauses of the Locarno Pact when necessary. This agreement was approved by France on March 6, just one day before Germany abandoned the Locarno Pact. Janson also commented on the proposals in the German memorandum, saying that some suggestions seem to be constructive and of interest to Belgium. However, Belgium's security is threatened by Germany's re-establishment of defenses in the Rhineland area. Therefore, if any agreement is concluded based on Germany's proposals, it should be supplemented with appropriate compensation to ensure that Belgium's security is not diminished.

<h3 id="e71">A Brief Discussion on Soil Improvement Methods (Part 1) <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Naifeng, Technician at the Central Agricultural Experiment Station</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen: Today's educational broadcast is my turn to talk about a brief discussion on soil improvement methods. The soil I am going to talk about is the soil used in agriculture, which is what plants rely on to grow. Originally, soil has many uses, such as building roads, building houses, making bricks and tiles, making pottery, and so on. However, most of the soil is used for planting. The main crops all grow on the soil, so the soil I am going to talk about is the soil used for planting.</p>
<p>Before talking about improvement, we should first know what good soil is like and what bad soil is like, and then we can talk about how to turn bad soil into good soil. This is the order of my topic. In other words, what I am going to talk about is, first, the conditions of good soil, second, the types of bad soil, and third, how to improve the soil.</p>
<p>The influence of soil on the plants growing on it can be divided into the following six factors: first, providing moisture; second, providing air; third, providing warmth; fourth, providing nutrients; fifth, being free from diseases and pests; and sixth, having sufficient depth to allow the roots of plants to fully develop. These six are the factors provided by the soil that can control plant growth. If one of them is deficient, the plants above cannot grow to a perfect extent.</p>
<p>Plants need a lot of water. Generally speaking, every pound of dry plant, whether it is rice straw or grains, needs 300 to 600 pounds of water to nourish it. Air is equally important. If the air is not ventilated, the plant will suffocate. Moreover, there is a lot of carbon gas in the soil. If it is not regulated, the plant will also be injured. As for temperature, most of it depends on the weather, and a small part also depends on the soil. Some soils are warm, and some soils are relatively cold. If it is too cold, the plant cannot grow, or even freeze. If it is too hot, the plant will also die from the heat. As for the nutrients of the plant, of course, it depends on the soil supply, and the soil should not contain any disease or pest components, so as not to hinder the growth of the plant. Finally, the soil must also have sufficient depth, generally about two or three feet deep. If it is less than two or three feet, only a few plants can grow, and large plants will not work.</p>
<p>If the soil is good, then its texture must be neither loose nor sticky. The soil particles are about two or three centimeters in diameter. If, in the same place, one type of soil has a large block structure and the other has a small granular structure, then the soil with the large block structure must be worse. Listeners, don't think that all soils are the same as what you see. If you pay attention when you have the opportunity, you can see many different structures, different colors, and different properties. If you take it to the chemical laboratory for chemical testing, then there will be more different properties. Furthermore, if good soil is dug down, the top seven or eight inches should be very loose, and the bottom should be slightly harder, but not so hard as to be like a brick. When digging seven or eight feet deep, there should be water underneath. The above describes the physical properties of good soil. As for its chemical properties, it should be rich in nutrients and organic matter (that is, humus), and should be neither alkaline nor too acidic, generally between PHS. 5.0-7.0. Also, the soluble salt content in the soil should be below 0.1 percent. If the physical properties are good and the chemical properties are also good, then the microbial properties must also be appropriate. This kind of good soil directly regulates the six factors mentioned earlier. These six factors are moisture, air, temperature, nutrition, and the opportunity for plant roots to develop to the bottom.</p>
<p>The types of bad soil can be divided into six types: climate-related, terrain-related, soil sodification-related, and improper use-related.</p>
<p>Climate has a great influence on soil. The reason why a soil becomes a certain type of soil is because of the climate. Regarding this point, I will not prepare to talk about it in detail today, but only talk about two situations in which the soil is bad because of the climate. The first is too dry. When it is too dry, it is because of lack of water. As I said before, growing one pound of dry plant needs 300 to 600 pounds of water. Therefore, lack of water can directly affect the physiological functions of the plant. Because in this case, not only the nutrients in the soil are not easy to dissolve, but also the opportunity for plants to absorb nutrients is reduced. Soil that lacks water often lacks humus. Even if there is plant matter buried in the ground, it is not easy to rot because there is too little water. Moreover, such soil often does not have a leaching effect, and soluble salts such as calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate remain in the soil, creating a soil rich in soluble salts. The existence of a large amount of salt in the soil is harmful to plants. The second is too wet. If there is too much water, the air in the soil will be reduced, and the plant will suffer from lack of air. Also, because there is too much water, many oxidation processes in the soil stop. At the same time, the evaporation of water requires a lot of heat, so wet soil is also colder. All of the above situations are not conducive to plant growth.</p>
<p>Terrain has a great influence on soil. The soil on the small slopes is often washed away by rainwater. Not only the nutrients and humus in the soil are washed away by rainwater, but even the entire topsoil is washed away to the bottom. The subsoil (that is, the so-called raw soil) exposed due to the loss of topsoil is often very barren. The newly opened soil mountain is very good for the first two years, but after planting for a few years, it will not work. This is mostly because of this reason. The soil at the bottom of the slope is good because it receives nutrients and humus washed down from the slope. However, there are also unnecessary salts washed down, which makes the land at the bottom of the slope worse. Secondly, in terms of water distribution, the water in the soil on the hillside is easy to lose, while the water in the valley at the bottom of the hillside is not easy to drain. These are all the harms of bad terrain.</p>
<p>The relationship between the texture of the soil and the properties of the soil can be divided into two types: one is too loose and the other is too sticky. Too loose soil is sandy soil. Its problem is the lack of clay, therefore, it does not have the ability to retain water. When rainwater comes down, it is immediately drained away. It also does not have the ability to retain nutrients. After applying fertilizer, it is soon lost. Moreover, when there is a big wind, there is a danger of the entire sandy soil being blown away by the wind. Too sticky soil is not easy to cultivate, and because of its stickiness, not only air cannot circulate, but also water cannot be regulated. When there is a lot of rainfall, there is too much water, and when there is little rainfall, there is not enough water. Secondly, because there are many fine particles in the sticky soil, it swells when wet and shrinks when dry, so the soil is easy to crack. In this case, plant roots are easily injured. Indeed, clay soil often has a great ability to absorb water in many cases, but although there is a lot of water in the soil, plants cannot use it. At the same time, it also has a great ability to absorb fertilizer, but after applying fertilizer, it is often not easy to see results. In short, too sticky soil, because of the various influences of physical, chemical, and microbial aspects, causes it to undergo an unsanitary change, which is not suitable for general crops.</p>
<p>When the soil layers are not suitable, it can also make the soil very bad. Some soils have a hard layer of bedrock underneath. This layer is very hard, making it impossible for plant roots to penetrate, and rainwater from the sky also cannot penetrate. Some soils have a layer of loose sand underneath. In dry weather, water cannot rise up. Another type is that the soil is very thin, and there are stones below a few inches. These three types are all unsuitable soil layers.</p>
<p>So-called soil sodification refers to the fact that after a soil is eroded by salt, it initially has a lot of salt, and slowly the sodium in these salts erodes the texture of the soil. That is to say, these salts not only exist in the soil but also have a chemical effect with the soil. Such soil is often too sticky when wet and often very hard when dry, and the soil clumps are very large, the soil fertility is very low, and the plants that are planted are prone to problems if the rainfall is slightly unsuitable.</p>
<p>The above five types of bad soil can be summarized as naturally bad soil. The sixth type is man-made bad soil. Man-made bad soil is because the nutrients in the soil have been continuously used without adequate replenishment, so it becomes worse and worse. This situation is very common in our China. The reason: one is because there is not enough fertilizer, and the other is because there is no attention paid to a good crop rotation system, so this result occurs. However, this kind of man-made bad soil is easy to improve. Just apply the appropriate fertilizer. As for how to apply the appropriate fertilizer, this issue is very complicated, and I will not prepare to talk about it in detail today.</p>

<p>— Zhuang Xueben</p>
<p>Geography and History: Regarding our two-day investigation in Tangba Fort, the locals have a general understanding.</p>
<p>Tangba Fort is divided into six villages: 1. Tangba Fort, 2. Baiya Village, 3. Yaitou Village, 4. Xiaosi Village, 5. Caizi Gully, 6. Tangba Village. All are located on the east bank of the Shatang River and are now divided into two townships, Jinhua and Gonghe. Previously, there were only thirteen households, namely Tangba Major Household, Changshou Major Household, Yaitou Household, Yong'an Household, Xinzhuang Household, Xiaosi Household, Bulong Household, Xiaozhuang Household, Erlangbao Household, Tieling Household, Gongta Household, Dacaizi Household, and Yaomu Household. However, it has now grown to four hundred households; eighty percent are purely local people, and twenty percent are Han people who have migrated here.</p>
<p>During the late Qing Dynasty, they still had a Tusi system, under the jurisdiction of the Dongqi Tusi. Under the Tusi, there was also a Qianzong, a Bazong, and two Zongguans.</p>
<p>The ancestors of the Dongqi Tusi: Duo Liangzhi Shijieshi, were Chuantou people from the Western Regions, and served as the Right Minister of the Gansu Province during the Yuan Dynasty. In the fourth year of Hongwu in the Ming Dynasty, he was awarded the hereditary post of Commander Qian Shi. His son Duan Zhu succeeded to the post in the twenty-ninth year of Hongwu and died in battle, posthumously awarded the title of General of the Flying Cavalry and赐姓祁. By the tenth generation grandson, Qi Bingzhong, in the nineteenth year of Wanli, he inherited the position of Commander Tongzhi. Later, for his meritorious service, he was promoted to Chief Supervisor of the Ji Liao Left Capital Commander, added the title of Junior Guardian of the Crown Prince, and erected a monument in the middle of Jiehuang. By the Qing Dynasty, Qi Guoping, the son of Bingzhong, submitted in the second year of Shunzhi and inherited the post of Commander Tongzhi in the ninth year. He had two sons, Qi Bozhizhong, both of whom had martial talents. Bozhi was promoted to Luan Yi Shi for his merits, and Zhongzhi became a Jinshi in the ninth year of Kangxi and later promoted to Deputy General of Jinhua, Zhejiang for his merits. Later generations inherited the title. Now they live in Shengfangou, four miles north of Ledu County. Qi Huan is his descendant. (The above is recorded in "The Recent Qinghai")</p>
<p>Therefore, their Daolas sing about the history of their Tusi General Qi. After the establishment of the Republic of China, several sober-minded locals submitted a complaint to the Xining Prefecture, and from then on, the title of Qi Tusi was abolished. Tangba Fort was also freed from the Tusi's control. Before August of the nineteenth year, when the new Huzhu County was not yet established, this place was under the jurisdiction of Xizhai County.</p>
<p>Women are Diligent, Men are Lazy</p>
<p>The locals of Tangba have long abandoned the nomadic society and live by farming mountain land. However, their habits are still similar to those of nomadic societies. Family and field work are centered on women. Lazy men, except for cultivating the land, do not care about anything else in the fields or at home. Crops are harvested once a year because the local climate is very cold, with long winters and short summers. Hailstorms are also common in summer, and it snows in August and September. Therefore, crops are planted at the beginning of summer and harvested at the beginning of autumn. The main crops are Qingke barley, wheat, and soybeans.</p>
<p>Few of them are engaged in commerce. Handicrafts are also immature, only able to make felt and Hezi (wool cloth). Therefore, their economy is not very prosperous. Those with five or six mu of land, one or two cows, and a dozen sheep are called "Xiaoda Households," – a small well-off family. Lending interest rates are very high, generally from 2.5% to 4.5%. Land prices are very low, only worth 50-60 Chuan per mu, which is about 10 yuan in national currency. Taxes are very high, and each mu of land must pay 50-60 Chuan in grain tax per year. There are also many other corvée duties. Wages are very low. The price for doing hard labor for others every day, in addition to providing meals, is only 5 to 10 cents.</p>
<p>Unique Costumes</p>
<p>The clothing of the locals: children over four or five years old mostly do not wear trousers. Now, in the winter when it is ten degrees below zero, their calves are frozen like red radishes. Wealthy men wear cloth clothes like Han people, and ordinary people use Hezi to make clothes. The style is the same as the Han people's long gowns. They also have yellow skin, dark brown eyeballs, and black hair, and flat faces. After wearing Han clothes, they cannot be distinguished from Han people. However, the decorations of their women are worth introducing. During ordinary work periods! Cloth trousers, long Hezi clothes, waistbands, barefoot, wearing brimmed felt hats. In summer, they wear small round bamboo hats in the style of umbrellas. During New Year's festivals, they wear red-sleeved clothes, tie floral belts, wear silver rings hanging down like chains in both ears, and wear a large necklace around their necks: the necklace is full of white clam shells polished like copper coins. Hair ornaments: Wearing a red hat that rises more than a foot high, like a dustpan. The hat is made of red cardboard and wire, and the edges are all drooping red tassels. Because it looks like a dustpan, it is commonly called a "Dustpan Head." Behind it, a silver bowl-style ornament with embroidery covers their hair bun, and another silver or copper hairpin a foot long is inserted horizontally behind their heads. The red tassels on their foreheads are triangular, like old-fashioned bangs. Adult women, the unmarried, have a wide red border on the trouser legs, and the married have a black border. This can also be considered some external distinction between virgins and married women.</p>
<p>Sleeping with Cattle and Sheep</p>
<p>Their diet is mainly Qingke barley and wheat; made into noodles, or 　, or fried into Ba. In summer, wild vegetables are added to the noodles, called "Green Grass Rice." Usually, men like to drink alcohol, which is brewed from Qufu grain and yeast and can be drunk in ten days. The color is clear and the taste is light. Because it is easy to drink, they get drunk every time they drink.</p>
<p>Most of the houses are square bungalows, with a circle of earth walls outside, forming a courtyard. Chickens, dogs, and pigs are raised in the middle, and it also serves as a pen for cattle and sheep. The houses are mostly divided into three or four rooms with earthen walls. The middle room is used as a scripture hall for hanging god statues and for entertaining guests. One side is the bedroom. One side is the kitchen. The younger generation and calves and lambs in winter sleep in the kitchen. The sleeping earthen pit is connected to the stove. A short earthen wall separates them. Cooking is done in front, and people sleep behind. They don't need to burn the pit separately in the cold winter nights, which is a smart and economical method for them. They sleep in a very mixed way. Most men and women sleep together. Like the Fan people, they don't have quilts. When they sleep, they untie their belts, and the clothes they wear during the day become their bedding at night.</p>
<p>Marriage and Funeral Customs</p>
<p>The customs of the locals: the social interaction between men and women is very open. Boys and girls of the same age make friends, called "Holding Hands." Men make friends with men, called "Sworn Brothers." Women make friends with women, called "Sworn Sisters."</p>
<p>However, their marriages are mostly decided by their parents. There is a matchmaker who comes and goes to mediate, and they cannot get rid of the habit of autocracy. The betrothal gifts include cattle, sheep, livestock, cloth, felt, Qingke barley, wine, etc., depending on the economic situation of the man's family. The rich pay 70-80 yuan, and the poor pay 20-30 yuan. They use livestock as transportation to pick up the bride. Upon entering the door, they worship heaven and earth, and the bride enters the kitchen. At this time, the woman's relatives also come to the man's house for a banquet. Everyone sits around in the garden in front of the village; they hold wine jars decorated with a piece of wool and begin to "Daola," singing and drinking, praising each other, taking pride in those who have many songs and crisp voices. The wine banquets the man's family uses to treat relatives include fried , vegetable buns, etc., divided into three courses: The first course is called "Panshan Tea," the second course is called "Shaomai Tea," and the third course is called "Beef Rib Tea."</p>
<p>Now, marriage is also relatively free, but after the two parties are aligned, they must still go through the process of parental matchmaking. The age of marriage is mostly under fifteen years old.</p>
<p>Funerals mostly use cremation. After a local dies, the corpse is carried to the wilderness, and a Lama is invited to chant scriptures to transcend the soul. An earthen pit is dug, and a fire is built to cremate the corpse.</p>
<p>Religious Beliefs</p>
<p>The religion of the locals is also Lamaism, so families with several sons must send one or two to become Lamas. Every densely populated village must have a village temple. On the tops of the high mountains near the village, a pile of Mahayana trees is piled up, a few branches are inserted, and a few sutra cloths are hung, serving as their mountain god.</p>
<p>They have a deep belief in the guardian deity arrow. The guardians have names such as "Five Platform Guardian," "Cow Head Guardian," and "Sheep Head Guardian." They all have a guardian enshrined in their homes. They also have considerable faith in Lamason "Mule Heavenly King"; the Mule Heavenly King is a blue-faced, fanged, ugly deity riding a green mule. He does not have a very high position in Lamaism. In addition, they also pay considerable respect to the Garuda bird and the twelve gods.</p>
<p>On the slopes near the village and at the intersections of the main roads, many "Pengkang" are built. A Pengkang is a square object with mud Buddhas "Zhacha" sealed in the middle, printed with wooden boards. Such Pengkang are originally also found near Lama temples in various places, but the locals build more because they have great faith that Pengkang can block the hail disasters in summer. Before the Pengkang were built in the local villages, there were many hail disasters, but they gradually decreased afterward. On the first and fifteenth of each month, and during their spare time, they mostly circle around it, chanting Om Mani Padme Hum, praying.</p>
<p>Locals do not wash their faces very much, let alone take baths. Because they do not pay attention to hygiene, they suffer from many diseases. When they get sick, they go to the temple to make a wish or invite a god. They are superstitious about divine power. Once, we were wandering around in the village. A local held a sick child and wanted us to raise our feet and step on his little head, so that the child could recover from illness and prolong life. We could only follow his instructions and step on it.</p>
<p>Coal Mines by the Roadside</p>
<p>On the evening of the third day, we returned to the county government and spent the night. On January 27th, early in the morning, the county magistrate sent Director Wang and a policeman, along with several livestock, to take us to Hongkangzigou, sixty miles east of the county; because we needed to conduct further investigations in more purely local villages.</p>
<p>We left the east gate at ten o'clock, facing the sun. Five miles to Donggou, which is also a local village. Several red-clothed local women visiting relatives were holding children and riding white horses, reflecting the white snow on the mountain peaks and the solid ice in the gully, forming a beautiful and harmonious picture.</p>
<p>Below, there were few traces of people. Ten miles through Halazhigou, which is also a huge river in Huzhu. Gray-black coal was found along the gully. Although the quality on the surface is very poor, there must be better coal seams underneath.</p>
<p>After climbing over two relatively high earthen mountains, the horses' hooves stepped onto the edge of Hongya Zigou. Peaceful locals looked at several new travelers with surprise. After passing through a slender poplar forest, a row of earthen houses on the hillside to the left came into view. The policeman led my livestock to stop in front of an earthen wall. Several locals greeted us respectfully and carefully took our blankets and spread them on the fire pit in the main room, inviting us in.</p>
<p>Here, there are wide courtyards, spacious houses, and neat mangers. In the past, it was the Yamen of Tusi Sang Siege Li. At dusk, an emaciated and aging old man of sixty-five, supported by illness, came out to greet us. He was Tusi Li Chengxiang. We were entertained by him and stayed here for five consecutive days, until after the "You Ning Temple" Devil Dance on the eighth day, before returning to Xining.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Shandong Province Motor Road Starts Carrying Mail <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Mail Transportation Agreement Has Been Finalized</p>
<p>Civilian Communication is Increasingly Convenient</p>
<p>Jinan Communication: The construction industry in this province is making rapid progress. The provincial telephone network has been completed early. In addition to the government transmitting orders, it is also open to the public. Civilian transmission is convenient, but the cost is still too high, so we must pay attention to mail delivery. Naturally, mail delivery is rapid along the Jinpu and Jiaoji railways. Those farther away from the railway are still extremely inconvenient. Taking the counties in Jiaodong, Luxi, and Lunan as examples, letters sent to Jinan often take three or four days. Jinan newspapers sent to various counties still lack interest because the news is delayed, which has a major impact on culture. In recent years, the motor roads in this province have been expanded one after another, reaching more than 10,000 miles. Although they carry passengers, they do not transport mail. Letters and packages are still mostly transported by porters or old-fashioned carts, so they cannot be fast. The people suffer from this. Recently, the Shandong Provincial Postal Administration and the Provincial Motor Road Administration have finalized a contract for transporting mail. The Motor Road Administration reported to the Construction Department, and Construction Director Zhang Honglie presented it to the provincial government's political affairs meeting for discussion today (the 11th). It was resolved to approve it, and the post office and the Motor Road Administration will determine the date and start transportation immediately. This is truly a new era in the transportation of this province. The contract signed by the Post Office and the Motor Road consists of 25 articles, and the transportation method is stipulated in great detail. The routes are divided into two types: one is the transportation route, and the other is the agency for escorting and transporting routes. The types of transportation include letters, postcards, ordinary registered newspapers, printed matter, trade contracts, samples, etc., small packages within the weight limit, and occasional packages, as well as all official business to and from the post office, can also be transported. Each route opens once a day each way, and the specified weight is limited to 500 kg for the Yanwei Road, and 150 kg for other roads (if the Yanwei Road Bureau operates official cargo vehicles, it may transport large packages, and the package limit and remuneration will be determined separately by both parties at that time). All mail transported by the post office, light mail, is exempt from freight. For heavy mail, the remuneration is one cent per kilogram for every 100 Chinese miles. In order to save the trouble of classification and calculation, 20% of the total weight is used as free light mail, and the remaining 80% is used as the weight of heavy mail for which remuneration should be paid. It will be settled and paid at the end of each month. Regarding the agent transportation, the post office sends an escort to escort the vehicle along the way. If there is any damage, the Motor Road Bureau is not responsible. The escort can ride the car for free. If the Motor Road Bureau acts as an agent for escorting and transportation, the Motor Road Bureau is responsible. The post office pays the Motor Road Bureau a considerable subsidy for the escort every month.</p>
<h3 id="e75">The Jin Cheng Railway Across Rehe is Completed <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>First Constructed by Mantetsu, Still Managed by Mantetsu</p>
<p>The Japanese Will Use It to Counter Russia and Mongolia and Control North China</p>
<p>Jinzhou Communication: The Jin Cheng Railway, commissioned by the puppet organization to Mantetsu to construct and manage, was announced by Mantetsu on the 1st of this month to start business on March 10th. It is verified that the completion of the line is the 436-kilometer railway between Jinzhou and Chengde, which is now fully open. This line crosses Rehe and occupies an extremely important position militarily. On the one hand, it can deal with Soviet Russia and Mongolia, and on the other hand, it can control Hebei, Chahar, and other provinces. The Japanese have planned carefully and thoroughly, and on the surface, it is said to be for business purposes, to facilitate travel and transportation of industries. According to its scheduled timetable, from March 10th, Train 3 will depart from Jinzhou at 7:00 a.m. and arrive in Chengde at 9:50 p.m. Train 4 will depart from Chengde at 7:00 a.m. and arrive in Jinzhou at 9:50 p.m. In the future, it will run according to this timetable. The Japanese also boasted that the projects in Pingquan and Chengde were the most difficult, because the number of tunnels and bridges is said to be unique among all "Manchukuo" railways. Most of them are along the river, so the scenery is excellent, and there are historical sites in Chengde, which can be called the only tourist railway in Northeast China. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Honor of Zou Yixin, a Female Astronomer Studying in Japan <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Currently Diligently Studying at the Azabu Observatory</p>
<p>Japanese Newspapers Praise Her as the Shining Star of Astronomy</p>
<p>Tokyo Communication: Zou Yixin, a Chinese astronomer, was originally an assistant professor at the Guangzhou National Sun Yat-sen University Observatory. Last spring, she was sent to Japan by Zou Lu, the president of the university. After arriving in Japan, she studied diligently and was praised by scholars in Japan. Although the Tokyo Imperial University, which never accepts female students, also specially approved her admission to study. Newspapers here have reported on this matter. The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on January 8th of this year praised Ms. Zou as the only female astronomer in the Orient and a brave woman. Recently, a reporter from the "Miyako Shimbun" personally visited the Azabu Observatory to see Ms. Zou and asked for permission to take pictures. After returning, he wrote an article in the Miyako Shimbun on February 17th. The article praised her as the shining star of the observatory and praised her extremely. It is truly a highlight for the Chinese students studying in Japan. Now, the original text is translated as follows: "Ms. Zou, who is slender and dressed in a celadon Chinese dress, is truly a unique highlight in the ancient and majestic Azabu Observatory built by the Ministry of the Navy, which has a Meiji flavor. She is a top student at Sun Yat-sen University. After graduating, she immediately served as a technician at the astronomical observatory of her alma mater and wrote papers such as "Research on Sunspots." With such a young age and such achievements, her future is indeed infinitely promising. After the cherry blossoms bloomed last spring, she came to Japan to study. She first entered the Taiho School to learn Japanese, and then entered the observatory. Her daily conversations with the director and professors are naturally in Japanese, but when it comes to academic conversations, she uses English entirely. She also takes notes, attends lectures, and observes with telescopes. She is extremely enthusiastic about research and is truly a shining star of the observatory. She also reports to her alma mater every month. After returning to China, she will become a professor at her alma mater. It is also heard that Ms. Zou was married last year, and her husband is also an astronomer. He will be sent to France by Sun Yat-sen University next month. Because of the mission of Chinese academics, these two young people have to temporarily part ways like loving swallows. It is heard that the astronomical terms used in their correspondence are more than the words of love of newlyweds," etc. According to the observatory staff, since the construction of the observatory, there have been two Chinese students, both men. They returned to China seven or eight years ago and are now university professors. Ms. Zou is the only female student studying astronomy, and she is thought to be the only one in the Orient. From the director to the professors, they all praise Ms. Zou extremely. I look forward to O'Ddy Yun.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Chaoshan: Strictly Prevent Smuggling <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>—Newly Revised Regulations for Unpacking, Transporting, and Selling Rice and Beans—</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Last year, smuggling was rampant in the Chaoshan area. The smugglers had powerful backgrounds and illegally imported large quantities of rice and beans. They established numerous branch offices in the market towns of Chaozhou and Meizhou counties. These smuggled goods were first escorted by ruffians into the interior, and then the smugglers found ways to sell them off. Even today, smuggled goods continue to flow into Shantou unabated. Some unscrupulous merchants collude with foreign smugglers, committing all sorts of evils. When smuggled goods are seized by anti-smuggling checkpoints and tax police, ruffians come forward to demand their return. As a result, tax evasion incidents occur frequently. Furthermore, the anti-smuggling tax police conduct searches and inspections with extreme strictness, which sometimes leads to the mistaken seizure of goods on which taxes have already been paid. Last month, the Chaoan Chamber of Commerce, based on a petition from the Rice and Bean Industry Association, stated that Chaoan City is a distribution center for goods from the upper and lower reaches of the Han River. Sometimes, the tax-paid certificates affixed to the bags are lost en route. If the original bags of rice and beans must be opened for retail sale, Shantou also needs to repackage the original bulk into smaller containers before selling. Without opening and unpacking, it is impossible to sell; opening and unpacking risks being suspected by the tax police of repackaging or dealing in smuggled goods, and many merchants have been arrested and fined. The merchants feel it is unacceptable to be mistakenly charged with criminal offenses, and they have specially petitioned the Agricultural Tax Bureau to request the Finance Department to find a remedy to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. Yesterday, Xiao Sheng, the director of anti-smuggling in Shantou, resigned, and the Finance Department appointed Ye Hanzhi, the anti-smuggling commissioner for the Southern Route, to succeed him in Shantou. He also issued a "Regulation for Unpacking, Transporting, and Selling Rice and Beans," which was forwarded to the Shantou North and South Port Grain and Miscellaneous Goods Association for compliance as follows: All unpacking, transporting, and selling of foreign rice and beans must be declared to the local tax collection office or anti-smuggling agency before unpacking, so that personnel can be dispatched to supervise the unpacking. Foreign beans and other legumes that are sold in loose form must have the sales receipts submitted to the tax collection office or anti-smuggling agency for inspection, stamping, and release. The agency will register the quantity on the sales receipt for auditing purposes. When carrying goods accompanied by inspected sales receipts, the anti-smuggling checkpoints along the way should verify that the goods match the items on the receipt and release them immediately. If the retail quantity is within 50 catties and there is a formal merchant's sales receipt, reporting and inspection may be waived. Merchants who sell foreign rice and beans in loose form must report the retail quantity to the local tax collection office or anti-smuggling agency for verification on a ten-day basis. The report form must be submitted on the day following the end of each day. If domestically produced bean oil from places where the Agricultural Tax Bureau or tax collection office is established is transported and sold, a guarantee must be filled out in accordance with the Finance Department's order, together with the oil mill's sales receipt, and submitted to the Agricultural Tax Bureau or tax collection sub-office for guarantee and verification. A transportation permit will be issued to accompany the goods. For domestically produced oil sold in places where there is no tax bureau office, the "Regulations for the Free Transportation and Sale of Domestically Produced Oil" sent by the Provincial Assembly shall be followed. All sales receipts from domestically produced oil mills, as well as customs release forms and certificates from the local township office or chamber of commerce, should be inspected and released. The above regulations can be said to be extremely strict, but merchants feel that the procedures are very troublesome.</p>

<p>Finance Ministry Dispatches Personnel to Investigate Stamp Tax</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, in order to investigate the stamp tax in Wuxian County, specially dispatched Li Guoqi, together with Tong Yixiang, a member of the Suzhou Finance Department, to Suzhou. The county government dispatched Xu Hengbo, a staff member, to accompany them yesterday (12th) morning to various places to investigate the stamp tax from store to store. After the urban area is investigated, they will go to various rural areas for investigation.</p>
<p>Wujiang Secretary Accepts Bribes and Will Be Sent to the Provincial Capital</p>
<p>Huang Heng, who resides at No. 2 Taohuawu in Liumen, accepted bribes and committed malfeasance while serving as the secretary of the Wujiang County Anti-Smoking Association last year. After the Jiangsu Supervisory Envoy's Office dispatched personnel to investigate, Huang was arrested and sent to the Wujiang County Government for detention by the security team. It has been proven by the bribing soil vendors such as Cai Zhiqian that Huang received a bribe of 1,800 yuan, delivered in two installments at the Lao Danfeng Restaurant and Lu Wang Ruiyu Teahouse in Suzhou. County Magistrate Xu was greatly angered and has submitted a request for instructions to the province. It is rumored that he will be sent to the Zhenjiang Provincial Security Office for investigation.</p>
<p>Wind and Rain Devastate Incense Snow Sea</p>
<p>Dengwei Mountain in Guangfu Township, Suzhou, is planted with plum trees within ten li, and is known as the Incense Snow Sea. Every year during the first and second months of the lunar calendar, tourists flock there. This year, the spring cold was particularly severe, and there was continuous rain and snow. Until today, the plum blossoms of Dengwei have not yet bloomed, so there are few tourists. Although a few people still go to explore the plum blossoms, they all return disappointed. According to the locals, the plum blossoms have been devastated by the wind and rain this year, and their roots have been damaged. Even if they bloom when the weather warms up, they may not be as prosperous as in previous years, and the fruit production will be greatly affected in the future.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>筹建公共大會堂</p>
<p>筹建公共大會堂</p>
<p>This district's first district office held its 75th district affairs meeting yesterday, resolving the following: The office's expenditure report for October to December of the 24th year has been compiled and reported to the county for record and should be retroactively acknowledged. The staff members of the township offices in this district should undergo short-term training, with the district office formulating implementation measures. In a democratic nation, people's gatherings are of utmost importance, but this district lacks a suitable venue. It is proposed to construct a public assembly hall, with the district head serving as the preparation director and the township heads serving as the preparation members, named the "First District Public Assembly Hall," with a provisional budget of 10,000 yuan. The entire district has only seven small vegetable markets. Temporary vegetable markets should be set up in prosperous street areas. Self-government research associations keep self-governance information that can be claimed from the township offices. Obey the order to bury floating coffins on the Jinghu and other roads to prioritize public health. Obey the universal vaccination methods order; township offices should publicize the benefits of vaccination and find ways to implement them. The replacement of roadside trees on Tonghui Road within the district this year will have its location determined by the district office and planned for implementation.</p>
<p>Flour Mills All Shut Down</p>
<p>There are four flour mills in this county: Maoxin Numbers 1 and 2, Jiufeng, Tailong, etc. Their flour has a wide sales area, reaching various provinces in North China. Since the September 18th Incident, the loss of the Northeast has greatly impacted sales. In recent years, due to droughts and floods in various regions, sales have seen a rebound and become profitable. Last summer, the wheat harvest in various regions was poor, and the mills could not procure raw materials smoothly. Furthermore, the price of wheat has been increasing daily, almost as expensive as rice. Since the start of operations this year, the flour market has been even better, and the mills have been processing goods around the clock. However, raw materials are scarce, and the rice shops have also sold out their stocks. The mills have sent personnel to various counties to purchase, but the counties also have no grains to spare. Therefore, they have been forced to shut down in the past two days. Currently, the mills have less than 40,000 bags of flour in stock, and the flour shops have only slightly more than 10,000 bags in stock. If there is no import of foreign wheat or flour, prices will inevitably rise. Yesterday (12th), the market price of flour shops was 3.42 yuan per bag for Green Mountain Foot and Green Battleship brands, and 3.27 yuan per bag for Red Mountain Foot. The noodle shops will also raise prices soon.</p>

<p>Communications Soldier Commits Suicide Out of Patriotism</p>
<p>Song Xueyun, a communications soldier of the 552nd Regiment of the 87th Division of this county, around 30 years old, from Hunan, suddenly committed suicide with a rifle at 7:30 PM the day before yesterday. The bullet entered through the stomach and exited through the back, piercing the stomach. He immediately fell to the ground, groaning in a pool of blood. After being discovered, he was immediately sent to the Shensu Yiyuan Hospital in Dongchu for treatment. It is said that the reason for Song's suicide was that he felt that the foreign troubles were becoming increasingly urgent, the national affairs were deteriorating, and there was no joy in life, so he committed suicide.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce Holds Extraordinary Joint Meeting</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce held a joint meeting of executive and supervisory members in March yesterday, chaired by Yu Xiaochuan. Matters for discussion: The Wuxian Chamber of Commerce proposed to continue forwarding the case for the addition of auxiliary coins. It was resolved that the association would continue to petition for the addition and also write to the chambers of commerce in other provinces and cities to jointly advocate for it. The Yixing Chamber of Commerce proposed that inland copper coins are flooded. Is it feasible to petition the provincial government to order all counties to comply with the standards of the Ministry's order and not freely expand or contract in order to provide relief? Resolution: Telegraph the Ministry of Finance to notify the three banks of China, Communications, and Bank of China to comply with the ministry's standard of 300 copper coins and 12 silver dimes per silver dollar, and, depending on the circumstances of each region, redeem as much as possible to stabilize market prices and provide a standard rate. The Yixing Chamber of Commerce proposed that the dime notes issued by various banks have the same face value but different styles, making them difficult to distinguish. It is proposed to petition the Ministry of Finance to order the banks to clearly distinguish the grades of the face value of the new dime notes issued in the future by size and color for easy identification. Is it feasible? Resolution: Forward the case as is. The Changshu Chamber of Commerce proposed that the business tax on soybean cakes and wheat gluten be increased by order. At this time of rural decline and commercial depression, please continue to collect it at 2 per mille to reduce the burden on the people. Resolution: Forward the case as is to the Ministry of Finance.

<p>Dispute Arises Over Labor Service</p>
<p>The people of Shounan Township in Yin County began winter labor service at town construction jobs at 9:00 AM on the 10th in Zhou Su Du, south of Yin. More than 4,000 conscripted laborers arrived to attend the opening ceremony. However, after the ceremony, many of the conscripted laborers began to criticize. Troublemakers incited conflict and made things difficult for the organizers. A fashionable woman with permed hair wearing a gray tweed overcoat in the crowd even shouted for the organizers to be overthrown. A tumult arose, and order was disrupted. Mud clods and wooden sticks flew. Ni Weixiong, a section chief of the county government, technician Wang Dianzhang, and the township chiefs who were present saw that there was no reasoning and temporarily avoided the fray, and immediately telegraphed the county government to send police to suppress the crowd. However, due to time constraints, by the time the police arrived, two rooms of Township Chief Rong Gu's residence and the Daonan Elementary School building, as well as three flat rooms of the Shounan Township Office's offices and school supplies and documents, had been almost completely destroyed. Also, six rifles, four broadswords, and sixteen spears belonging to the township office were thrown into the river. Afterwards, the police apprehended more than ten people, including Lou Xiaomao, who had acted recklessly, and sent them to the Jiangshan Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

The Prime Minister devoted his life to the revolution, enduring great hardships. The Prime Minister still upheld his spirit of perseverance and created the Republic of China. During this commemorative occasion, we trace the Prime Minister's great revolutionary deeds and the revolutionary legacy left to us. We firmly believe that the Prime Minister is not only the highest revolutionary leader of this party but also the only revolutionary leader of the Chinese nation. However, the Prime Minister passed away in 1925, and this party lost this great revolutionary leader, and the Chinese nation also lost a respectable and lovable nanny. Now that this party has unified China, but internally the Red bandits are scurrying eastward and disturbing the west, and in some areas, they are still extremely rampant, while externally the enemies are still baring their fangs and claws, destroying our Chinese nation. The national crisis is deepening, and the nation is on the brink of danger. We firmly believe that to save this crisis, there must be a leader to succeed the Prime Minister to lead us out of this critical environment and save our people from this sea of suffering. The Prime Minister's dying words to us were: "Peace, struggle, save China." Therefore, what we hope for from this party's leader is to be able to uphold the Prime Minister's spirit and work hard to save the country. Today, the international situation is becoming increasingly tense, and we should promptly and actively prepare strategies for national survival, so as not to disappoint the Prime Minister's spirit in heaven.</p>
<p>Commemorative Slogans</p>
<p>After the Chairman's report, slogans were immediately shouted: Promote the Prime Minister's revolutionary spirit! Continue the Prime Minister's revolutionary cause!恪Strictly abide by the Prime Minister's revolutionary teachings! Step up production and construction! Commemorate the Prime Minister and strive to resist aggression and save the country! Commemorate the Prime Minister to revive the Chinese nation! Commemorate the Prime Minister to eliminate all traitors! Long live the Republic of China! Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party! Long live the Three Principles of the People!</p>

<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>After the ceremony, Chairman Wu, the Mayor, delivered a speech saying: Today is the 11th anniversary of the Prime Minister's death, and we are holding a commemorative ceremony and tree planting ceremony in order to commemorate the Prime Minister's legacy of advocating afforestation. The Prime Minister said in his will that the purpose of the revolution is construction, and the most important thing in construction is people's livelihood. Therefore, the purpose of the revolution is to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood. Afforestation is the construction of the national economy, that is, the construction of people's livelihood. In recent years, our country has been plagued by frequent disasters. Both central and local authorities are actively engaged in water conservancy construction, and at the same time advocating afforestation, in order to achieve lasting stability and social livelihood. Agriculture is the foundation of our country, but the amount of agricultural imports is very large every year. The cultivation abilities inherited from the past have gradually disappeared. Therefore, in order to save the country and seek national prosperity, we must implement the Principle of People's Livelihood. As the ancient saying goes, "It takes ten years to grow a tree, but a hundred years to cultivate a man." All of you children who are participating in the ceremony today must understand this principle. To be a human being, one must first receive good education from the country, society, and family, acquire sufficient knowledge, and contribute to society and the country in order to exert the ability to be a human being. Only then will life have value.</p>

On the right were the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Assembly, the New Life Movement Promotion Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Education Association, the Municipal Agricultural Association, and the Municipal Defense Committee. Led by Mayor Wu, they braved the rain on the roadside, holding iron shovels, and personally planted the trees. The ceremony ended at 11:00 AM.</p>

<h3 id="e79">City Health Bureau Director Li Tingan Returned to China Yesterday <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Resumes Duty Today</p>
<p>Report to the Capital in the Coming Days</p>
<p>Mr. Li Tingan, the Director of the Municipal Health Bureau of this city, was ordered to go abroad in early November of last year to inspect health administration affairs in Europe and the United States. After spending four months and visiting more than ten countries, he arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon on the Norddeutscher Lloyd's Scharnhorst. The ship docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf at 4:00 PM, and all the welcoming personnel boarded the ship to shake hands and greet Mr. Li. He then disembarked and returned to his residence in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Inspection Process</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reporter met with Mr. Li on the ship. According to him, he was ordered to go abroad for inspection and visited more than ten countries. He first went to Japan, then crossed the Pacific Ocean to Canada and the United States. Then he crossed the Atlantic Ocean to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Switzerland, Italy, and other countries. In Geneva, he met with Dr. Rajchman, the former League of Nations technical expert sent to China, to exchange ideas on improving China's health administration.</p>
<p>Impressions</p>
<p>During this trip, I visited Japan and various European and American countries. My impression is that all countries are striving to update their health facilities, and there are many improvements in health administration that can be used as a model for our country. Among them, Yugoslavia's health administration is particularly suitable for China's national conditions. Therefore, in the future, I plan to use Yugoslavia's health administration as the basis for reforming China's health administration.</p>
<p>Resumes Duty Today</p>
<p>Mr. Li has been away from the country for a long time, and all important bureau affairs need to be handled personally. Therefore, he will resume duty today. All health facilities in this city are being actively improved, and various health construction projects are being actively undertaken. The opening of municipal hospitals, the expansion of health offices and health laboratories in various districts, and the development of various other health affairs all await Mr. Li's planning.</p>
<p>Visit to the Mayor</p>
<p>Mr. Li was sent abroad by the Municipal Government and the Central Health Administration to inspect the health administration of various countries. Therefore, he will visit Mayor Wu Tiecheng today to report on the inspection process, so that the capital city can learn from it in developing health undertakings. He will also go to the capital in the coming days to report to Liu Ruiheng, the Director of the Health Administration. As for Mr. Li's detailed report on his overseas inspection, it will be published after it has been organized.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Tea Association Received a Reply Telegram Yesterday</p>
<p>The National News Agency reported that the foreign tea firms in Shanghai, after hearing rumors that the National Economic Commission was going to control Qihong black tea, telegraphed the relevant authorities to express their opposition. The association yesterday received a letter and telegram from the National Economic Commission and the Anhui Provincial Government forwarded by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, stating that such rumors were a misunderstanding and not factual. The letter and telegram are recorded below:</p>
<p>Anhui Provincial Government Telegram: In direct reply, regarding the telegram arguing against the control of Qihong tea, we previously received a reply telegram from the National Economic Commission and have already forwarded it to your association. Now, on the 4th of this month, we received another telegram from Chairman Liu of the Anhui Provincial Government and the Deputy Director of the Construction Department, stating, "We acknowledge receipt of the telegram. This was decided at the Qihong Tea Technology Discussion Conference of the National Economic Commission, which only discussed the marketing methods of Qihong black tea and did not decide to control Qihong tea. Even the marketing methods are still under careful discussion and will not hinder tea firms from making loans. Please inform them not to worry too much." This telegram has been received. A corresponding letter is hereby sent to you for your information. Addressed to: Foreign Tea Firms Association of Shanghai, Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Economic Commission Letter: In direct reply, on the 2nd of this month, the Secretariat of the National Economic Commission approved Document No. 22109 of the Agriculture Department, stating, "We acknowledge receipt of the telegram. The purpose of the Agriculture Department convening the Tea Technology Discussion Conference is to improve Chinese tea, not to control Qihong tea. Although a representative from the Anhui Construction Department proposed Qihong tea marketing methods, after extensive discussion, only the principles were approved, with the caveat that export tea merchants (i.e., tea firms facing unemployment and debt) must be considered. The conference had already taken the position of the tea firms into account. In summary, the Agriculture Department of the Commission has always held the principle of cooperation and mutual assistance to revitalize Chinese tea. Although there were many advocates for control at the time of the discussion, the conference believed that this matter was of great importance, and the purpose of the conference was to focus on technical research. It treated all sectors of the tea industry equally, considered all aspects, and did not discriminate. The Foreign Tea Firms Association had previously telegraphed Mr. Zhou to express their thanks, and we have already sent a detailed reply. We are now sending another telegram for your information." Approved. We have received your association's letter regarding this case and have forwarded it for investigation and reply. The reply is now approved. Please inform them accordingly. Addressed to: Foreign Tea Firms Association of Shanghai, Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<h3 id="e89">The Four Banks Separately Receive the Preparations of the Provincial Banks <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The preparations of the eight banks in this city have been received clearly</p>
<p>The National News Agency reported that the Issuance Preparation Committee of the Ministry of Finance has entrusted the four banks, namely the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China, to receive the cash reserves and guarantee reserves of various banks inside and outside this city. The provincial and local banks have now been assigned to the four banks for separate receipt. The banks in this city have been received clearly, and only minor issues remain to be resolved in accordance with the ministry's order. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Two Methods Determined for Receiving</p>
<p>Before the Farmers Bank of China obtained the right of issuance, the provincial and local banks were first received jointly by the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. However, due to the relationship of joint receipt, everything, big or small, had to be discussed by the three banks before it could be carried out, which was not unified in authority and not economical in time. Therefore, the Issuance Preparation Committee decided on two new methods yesterday: The provincial and local banks that have already been received by the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications will continue to be received by the three banks, but they will be assigned separately, each receiving one or several banks. The provincial and local banks that have not yet been received will be entrusted to the Farmers Bank of China for receipt in order to unify authority and facilitate prompt action.</p>
<p>Methods for Distributing Banks Already Received</p>
<p>As for the provincial and local banks that have already been jointly received by the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, the method of assigning receipt is based on the depth of the mutual relationship between the banks, as follows: (A) The Central Bank of China receives the Shaanxi Provincial Bank; (B) The Bank of China receives the Peiping Baoshang Bank, the Zhejiang Local Bank, and the Henan Agricultural and Industrial Bank; (C) The Bank of Communications receives the Hubei Provincial Bank, the Tianjin Bianye Bank, and the Dazhong Bank, which moved its head office from Tianjin to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Receipt of the Eight Banks in This City is Clear</p>
<p>The Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications received the cash reserves and guarantee reserves of the eight banks that issue banknotes (originally nine banks, but the Farmers Bank of China has now been specially licensed by the government to issue banknotes). Except for minor issues such as the banknotes of the branches of the eight banks in other cities being exchanged for cash at the three banks whenever they are transported to Shanghai, the rest has been received clearly. As for the new banknotes that have been printed but not yet issued by the eight banks, except for the new banknotes of the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank which will be overprinted and issued by the Central Bank of China, and the new banknotes of the China Industrial Bank which will be overprinted and issued by the Bank of Communications, there are many new banknotes of other banks that have been printed but not yet issued. How to dispose of them has been communicated by the three banks to the Issuance Preparation Committee and forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for review and decision. The new banknotes of each bank are still sealed and awaiting orders.</p>

<p>Wang Guan Chang is an inland river fishery and should still be used</p>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reported that the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, at the request of Rongcheng County, Shandong, sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance on October 25 last year, stating that changing the color of fishery salt would hinder the fishing industry and requesting exemption from color change. The Federation has received a reply from the Ministry of Finance stating, "We acknowledge receipt of the telegram. Regarding the case of using red soil to change the color of fishery salt in the Shandong area, the Shandong Rongcheng County Chamber of Commerce and others previously submitted a petition to the ministry, stating that using red soil to change the color of fishery salt would affect the sales of fish and requesting permission to use white salt as before. After verification, it was found that except for Wang Guan Chang fishery salt in the Shandong area, which is an inland river fishery used for pickling shrimp paste, which should still be used and the color should still be changed with red soil as before, the other fishery salt farms do not need to implement the color change for the time being in order to avoid disturbances. Separate instructions have been issued to the relevant departments to comply with the above. Please be informed of the above information. This approval."</p>

<p>And Offers Discounting, Welcoming Inquiries from All Sectors</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency reported that Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank has recently been striving to promote acceptance bills in order to circulate the market and aid industry and commerce. It has specially formulated nine measures to welcome inquiries from all sectors for handling.

Any bank acceptance bill or commercial acceptance bill approved by the bank may be discounted. Commercial acceptance bills are limited to those arising from genuine goods transactions.

<h3 id="e92">Municipal Federation Branch Sends a Letter to the Ratepayers' Association, Proposing to Increase Chinese Directors <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>To Equalize Chinese Municipal Sovereignty</p>
<p>The 26th Branch of the Municipal Federation of Citizens proposed to increase the number of Chinese directors in order to equalize Chinese municipal sovereignty and suggested that this be discussed at the upcoming ratepayers' meeting. The text is as follows: To the Shanghai Ratepayers' Association: Since our country has respected the treaty and opened up the concessions, allowing the Shanghai Concession to be the general hub for commerce with various countries and establishing municipal organs, Chinese and foreigners reside here, fulfilling the obligations of taxpayers and gaining the right to participate in municipal affairs. The proportion of Chinese ratepayers in the Shanghai Public Concession has reached 70%. The Chinese directors and Chinese committee members should occupy 7/10 and 3/10 of the seats, respectively, in order to form a legal organization. Now, our Chinese people fulfill the majority of the obligations of taxpayers, but their rights are particularly biased and uneven, which is not the main body of the organization of the concession authorities. With this in mind, and in order to promote the construction of the municipality, the number of Chinese directors and Chinese committee members should be increased appropriately in order to develop the sovereignty of the municipality. Why have the resolutions and facilities of the Public Works Department been echoed by the taxpayers every time? This is because the number of our Chinese people participating in municipal power is too small, which is due to unfairness. The telephone problem can be seen from this. The ratepayers' meeting is about to open, and in order to safeguard the rights of the cloth, it is necessary to discuss the increase of Chinese directors and Chinese committee members and to pass a resolution to submit to the Public Works Department for recognition and increase, and to strive for the equalization of taxpayer rights. The selection of Chinese directors and Chinese committee members should be carefully considered. Former Chinese advisors and Chinese directors attending the Public Works Department, such as Wu Yunzhai, Yuan Ludeng, and Chen Guangfu, have worked hard for the municipality and have made outstanding contributions in the aftermath of the May Thirtieth Incident, which is well-known both at home and abroad. They are the leading figures of the citizens, so attention should be paid to the election. Accordingly, we hereby submit a letter to your association for presentation to the general meeting for discussion and implementation. Addressed to the Shanghai Ratepayers' Association.</p>

<p>Li Ciwen Broke His Left Hand and Foot</p>
<p>The Company Claims That This Did Not Happen</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that the CNAC Yundian Qian Kunming aircraft previously made a forced landing in Yizikong, causing damage to the aircraft body. The company immediately sent Aviation Director Ellison and Nie Kaiyi to Yunnan in a Douglas jumbo jet, where they transferred to cars to inspect the scene of the accident. The matter has been completed, and the passengers of the Kunming aircraft have been brought back to Chongqing. According to company sources, the Douglas aircraft left Chongqing for Shanghai yesterday morning. Details of the damage to the Kunming aircraft will be known after the report is received. All three passengers are safe and sound. The rumor that Li Ciwen broke his left hand and foot is not true. It is feared that this is a mistake due to the remote location of Yizikong and the inconvenience of transportation.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Japanese Set Up Ramie Spinning Mills in Korea to Resist Our Summer Cloth <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Consul in Korea Recently Reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Urging Our Summer Cloth Industry Merchants to Pay Attention</p>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently received a report from the consulate in Korea that the famous summer cloth produced in our country is imported into Korea every year, reaching more than 10 million bolts with a total value of 6 million yuan. Since Korea increased tariffs in 1920, there have also been about 1 million bolts. Unexpectedly, in the past two or three years, it has decreased sharply. The amount imported into Korea last year was only about one-tenth of what it used to be, only about 100,000 bolts. The reason for this is that Korea raised tariffs again in 1932. It was recently learned that Kanebo Textiles, a Japanese company, is planning to establish the world's only ramie spinning factory in Daejeon, Chungcheongnam-do, Korea. It has purchased 200,000 ping of land for the site and is engaged in construction. It has also transported 2 million ramie plants from Taiwan, planning to complete the project within three years. In addition to meeting the needs of all Korean people, it can also manufacture various ramie yarns and ramie cloths and extend its sales to various countries. In the future, our summer cloth industry will not only have its sales to Korea completely wiped out, but also be eliminated by Japanese summer cloth due to heavy tariffs and uneven quality and length of cloth. Therefore, it is proposed that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should forward this information to the Ministry of Industry to instruct merchants engaged in the summer cloth industry in our country to pay close attention in order to save the situation.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Shanghai Parents Education Research Association Held Its Ninth Regular Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Su Zengxiang Gave a Lecture on Children's Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Hu Zuyin Elaborated on the Mechanism of Children's Behavior</p>
<p>The Shanghai Parents Education Research Association held its ninth regular meeting at Hu's residence in Pingliang Village, Pingliang Road, at 6:30 pm yesterday. Members Zhu Duanfang, Liao Jiayi, Gu Jingren, Zhang Liling, Li Jingde, Wang Liufen, Hu Zuyin, Tao Shaoyuan, Ge Liting, Zhao Chuanjia, Mei Jinliang, Zhang Shizhang, Chen Hanming, Chen Zhengfan, and specially invited pediatric expert Su Zengxiang, who studied in Germany, attended. After dinner, Su Zengxiang first gave a lecture on children's tuberculosis, saying that children's tuberculosis is by no means hereditary but arises from various acquired causes, such as contact with patients, hugging and kissing adults, drinking unsterilized milk, and parents taking them to dirty public places. Prevention methods focus on three major conditions: sunlight, air, and cod liver oil. When studying in Germany, she saw newborn babies in that country lying in nurseries with open windows and circulating air, even in snowy weather. Their bodies were covered with extremely warm blankets, with their mouths and noses fully exposed. Hot water bottles and electric heaters were placed beside them to increase the heat. This method can be used for reference by parents in our country. Then, Hu Zuyin elaborated on the mechanisms of children's behavior, roughly divided into identification, compensation, transfer, regression, rationalization, suppression, projection, escape, and self-defense reactions. In general, behavioral mechanisms are mechanical movements in behavior, representing various methods for people to cope with the environment. If parents can understand the various behavioral mechanisms of children, it will be easier to guide and manage them. Finally, Chairman Zhu Duanfang reported on the association's affairs. Member Chen Zhengfan has recently completed a book entitled "The Road of Chinese Parents," which is scheduled to be published on Children's Day this year and dedicated to parents across the country. The book's content includes: The Song of Chinese Parents, The Road of Chinese Parents, Chinese Parents in Extraordinary Times, Inspiration from the Souls of War Heroes, Ten Commandments for Parents, Intelligence Tests for Parents, Standards for Family Education, An Overview of Children's Health Science, An Introduction to Twenty Famous Works on Parents Education, The Soviet Mother-Child Competition, French Parents' Life, Notes for Mothers, and Notes for Infant Care. The author's purpose is to destroy the familyism of the East and replace it with collectivism, hoping to transform the psychology of ordinary parents and enable them to change their ways, work hard, and keep pace with the parents of modern civilized countries. It is expected that once this book is published, its impact on the future of our society will be far-reaching. The China Child Welfare Association is scheduled to convene the Second National Child Welfare Conference in Qingdao, Shandong, from July 14 to 18 this year. Our association, as one of the child welfare organizations, has received informal notice that in the future, in addition to sending representatives to participate in the conference, we must also prepare papers on parents' education to be presented and read at the conference. After the chairman's report, several motions were passed, and the meeting was adjourned, already at 9:30 pm.</p>

<p>The Shenshi News Agency reports that Xu Fu, Director of the Fujian Finance Department, after being transferred by the National Government to serve as Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau and concurrently Director of the Land Bureau, originally intended to go to Fujian to handle the handover.

Therefore, his trip to Fujian is temporarily uncertain. However, the new Director of the Fujian Finance Department, Chen Ticheng, arrived in Fujian on the 10th of this month and went to the department to take over on the 11th.

<p>The New Sound News Agency reports that Jin Xing Real Estate Company, operated by Sun Chunsheng, mortgaged its properties on Henan Road, including the Jin Xing Building and properties on Baker Road, to China United Trust Company and other banks and money shops for huge sums. Since the real estate industry declined, Sun Chunsheng not only ignored the maturity dates but also openly resisted under the name of a foreign merchant, causing significant disputes. Now, at the request of member banks and money shops, the Silver and Banking Industries Guild has jointly petitioned the authorities for sanctions and to recover the mortgage funds.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Trial Defendant Denied Witnesses Will Be Examined Again</p>
<p>Dou Zhen, a Shandong native, 36 years old, residing at No. 328, Zhoujiazui Road intersection, Youheng Road, recently hired lawyer Li Pengcheng to file a criminal self-accusation with the Second Special Court, accusing his fellow villagers Zhang Ren'an and Zhang's wife (residing on the upper floor of a barbershop at No. 87, Jixiang Street, Fada Road) and Zhao Lingsheng of the Caichan Department of the Zhongnan Hotel on Aiduya Road, of disrupting the family and requesting severe punishment according to law. The main points of his lawsuit are as follows: The plaintiff's wife, Wang Yuying, was having an affair with the third defendant while residing in Shanghai. After being discovered by the public, he took his wife and young son to live in Yongan Lane, Jiaozhou Road, Qingdao. On January 15, 1934, not long after the third defendant lured the plaintiff's wife away, she secretly fled back to Shanghai and cohabited with him (as evidenced by the defendant's letter). Later, because the plaintiff was very strict in preventing Yuying from running away, and also treated her with special care, she was able to live in peace. However, because the third defendant had not seen her in Shanghai for a long time, he sent the second defendant to Qingdao to lure her back to Shanghai, taking the plaintiff's wife and young son together. After his wife and children were abducted, the plaintiff became ill with anger and could not move, so he could not come to Shanghai to search for them. It was not until the end of last year that he came to Shanghai to investigate and learned the defendants' addresses, but did not know where his wife was hidden. The actions of the first and second defendants are sufficient to constitute the crime under Article 240, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code. The third defendant has committed crimes under Article 240, Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the same law. He requests that they be investigated and punished according to law. At the hearing the day before yesterday, the first defendant, Zhang Ren'an, was present, but the second and third defendants were not. The plaintiff first stated the background, and Zhang Ren'an replied that his wife was ill and could not attend. He denied abducting the plaintiff's wife and said he was falsely accused, requesting clarification. The judge dismissed him and adjourned the hearing to summon all the witnesses for further verification.</p>

<p>The Route Was Not Wrong Wang Jinfa Commits Manslaughter</p>
<p>Chuan Yunian, a native of Shandong, 33 years old, lived at No. 514, Hengfeng Road, Zhabei, and had been serving as a policeman at the Hengfeng Road Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for more than eight years. At 5 pm on the 8th of last month, he was ordered by his superior to deliver official documents to the General Bureau by bicycle. After finishing the task, he returned to the station on the same bicycle. Traveling from east to west, he passed Xinwen Road, Chihang Road, and the entrance of the Xihai Grand Theater, when suddenly a No. 15041, Route 10 public bus, driven by Wang Jinfa, came head-on at full speed, crushing his skull and killing him instantly. The scene was tragic. Afterwards, the Hengfeng Road Police Station sent an official and a policeman, Chen Fengqi, to the scene to investigate. It was found that the bus route was not wrong. However, because the Municipal Council Police did not prosecute the driver Wang Jinfa, it was reported that the deceased had 70-year-old parents, a young wife, and a four-year-old son. The entire family's livelihood depended on him. Now that he has been tragically crushed to death, the entire family's life is in a desperate situation. Therefore, the Municipal Public Security Bureau appointed legal counsel Ji X to act as the agent for the deceased's wife, Zhu, and filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the First Special District against Wang Jinfa for causing death by negligence, and attached a civil suit, demanding compensation of 1,800 yuan in national currency. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Hua Yugui of the First Special Court opened the eighth criminal court for a hearing. The defendant Wang Jinfa was not present, and lawyer Fan Gang appeared on his behalf, stating that the defendant had requested leave to return to his hometown before the court summons was served, and his leave would expire soon, so he requested that the hearing be adjourned. Then, Zhu and Chen Fengqi testified successively. Judge Liu announced that the hearing would be adjourned to summon the defendant for further questioning.</p>

<p>Her Husband Argues Ineffectively, Reports the Case, and the Defendant Is Arrested and Admits the Crime, Sentencing Is Scheduled</p>
<p>Hu Fuying, a native of Hubei, due to poverty, adopted out her four-year-old daughter Dongying to a fellow villager, Gao Wu, a housewife residing in a bungalow in Caoxiebang, Gordon Road, West Shanghai, on November 6 of last year. At that time, in addition to a written agreement, Hu also gave a dowry of 12 yuan. However, Gao Wu was by nature violent. After Dongying entered her home, she abused her, using the excuse that Dongying did not know how to be clean and made a mess with urine and feces, often whipping her. In addition to pressing her fingernails all over her body, she also used iron needles to prick the palms of both her hands, causing Dongying to be injured all over her body in a few months, and her cries were incessant. Nearby neighbors could not bear it and gossiped about it. Hu Fuying, Dongying's biological father, heard about it and went to Gao Wu's house to investigate. He found Dongying's face pale and her body full of injuries. When he argued with Gao, she was stubborn and unreasonable. Seeing that she could not be reasoned with, Hu went outside and called Chinese police officer No. 671, who arrested Gao Wu and took her to the Putuo Road Police Station, which transferred her to the women's prison for detention. He sent Dongying to Guangren Hospital, where it was confirmed that she had scars all over her body and two needle pricks on the palms of both hands. He issued an injury certificate and handed it over to the police station for filing. Gao Wu was sent to the First Special Court the day before yesterday, and prosecuted under Article 286, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code for the crime of injury. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case, saying that when he went to arrest the defendant yesterday, the neighbors all said that they often heard the defendant beat Dongying. This kind of fierce and evil person should be arrested. Dongying has also been brought to court. He presented the injury certificate to the court. According to Dongying's testimony, she was beaten and pricked with needles by the defendant, and Judge Liu verified in court that there were black dots and many scars on the palms of Dongying's hands. When questioned, Gao Wu admitted that because Dongying did not know how to be clean and often urinated on her pants, she beat her four times with her hands and pricked her once with a needle. Judge Liu ordered that the debate in this case be concluded and the sentence be announced next Wednesday. Gao Wu was remanded in custody, and Dongying was examined by the court's forensic doctor and taken back by her father, Hu Fuying.</p>

<p>Datong News Agency reports that since the China Public Huang Automobile Company ceased operations last year, the Second Special Court, at the request of creditors, ruled the company bankrupt.

<h3 id="e108">Large Group of Bandits Scheduled for Sentencing <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese and Western detectives of the Yulin Road Police Station arrested the notorious bandits Lu Kangming, Xu Fusheng, Zhao Xinquan, Zhang Jinsheng (from Suzhou), and Zhang Amao (from Pudong) at a teahouse at No. 541, Xiaoshadu at 8:10 pm on the 25th of last month and sent them to the First Special Court for detention. Detailed investigations are ongoing. It was found that between August 29 of last year and February 19 of this year, they formed a gang and robbed six households on Gansu Road (No. 129, Fang Wu), Jiaozhou Road (No. 5, Sun Bao), Aivenyi Road (No. 7, Wang Zhang), Maigen Road (No. 11, Wang Li), Xinzha Road (No. 22, Shen Faxiang), and Chengdu Road (No. 23, Zhou He), stealing clothing and silver worth more than 2,600 yuan. They were sent to the third criminal court for questioning the day before yesterday. Municipal Council lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated the case and requested punishment. Then, the victims testified about their robbery experiences. Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned them clearly and ordered them to be remanded in custody. The sentencing is scheduled for next Monday. Except for Zhang Amao, the other four bandits have committed two robbery cases in the French Concession. Detective Wang Rusong of the responsible police station requested their extradition. The court approved their extradition after the sentencing.</p>

<p>Wei Daosheng (a 22-year-old Fujian native), the accountant of Jin Fa Hao at No. 16, Yong'an Street, French Concession, previously failed in speculation and gambling, resulting in a deficit of more than 3,300 yuan in the shop's funds.

After the incident, Wei surrendered himself to the French Police Station on the 27th of last month and was sent to the Second Special Court for questioning according to law. Wei admitted his recklessness and mistakes. After the debate was concluded, on the morning of the day before yesterday, Judge Wang Xuhsu sentenced Wei Daosheng to six months of imprisonment for embezzlement in his business and two months of imprisonment for theft, to be served concurrently for a term of six months.

<h3 id="e110">Le Shinong Talks About the Successful Development of Cigarette Paper <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Perseverance Pays Off</p>
<p>The China Cigarette Paper Manufacturing Co., Ltd. has completely succeeded in researching and manufacturing cigarette surface paper, which is expected to reduce leakage by more than 4 million yuan annually. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency specially visited Le Shinong, the assistant manager of the company, yesterday to inquire about the imitation process.</p>
<p>Ten Years of Research and Development</p>
<p>The factory director, Ge Tianmin, had a close relationship with Mr. Zengai Tatsusaburo, a famous Japanese cigarette paper manufacturer, during his stay in Japan. Over tea and wine, they discussed the raw materials and manufacturing methods. Over the years, he learned a lot. He also sent his relative Hong Shaoting to work as a laborer in the Kitagawa Paper Mill for as long as ten years, observing and working hard, and deeply understanding the manufacturing method. Unable to endure any longer, he purchased a machine and returned to China last year to set up a factory to imitate the product. After one year of improvement, he succeeded.</p>
<p>Official Shipment</p>
<p>The factory has now raised a capital of 100,000 yuan and purchased a large machine specially for making cigarette paper from abroad. Together with the old one, there are two machines in total, which are currently in production. However, due to registration procedures, it is not easy to complete for the time being. According to Article 1 of the Regulations for Encouraging Industry promulgated by the Ministry of Industry, this invention of the factory should, as a rule, obtain the exclusive manufacturing right for ten years or less for sales throughout the country. In addition to sending personnel to Beijing to apply for awards from the Minister of Industry, it is heard that the factory is striving for scientific organization. According to Mr. Le, the factory is currently preparing for safety equipment, hygiene equipment, and simple life insurance for workers, with an annual budget of no less than several thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Recovering Leakage</p>
<p>Although cigarette paper is an extremely small item, the annual consumption is extremely large because many Chinese people like to smoke. According to Chinese cigarette factories, the annual output of cigarettes reaches one million boxes, and each box requires one roll of cigarette paper. Therefore, the annual consumption of cigarette paper also needs one million rolls. However, in fact, the factory does not have such a large output because its scope is limited, and the two machines cannot meet the demand. This is an inevitable trend in the future. Recently, many cigarette factories in Japan and other foreign countries have requested samples from the factory. However, because the factory's issuance procedures are not well-arranged, it has not been able to meet the expectations of all sectors for the time being.</p>

<p>Each Criminal Confessed Without Denial at the Police Station, Further Investigation Needed, Rescheduled for Another Hearing</p>
<p>Ke Long, the fifteen-year-old son of Weng Jingqing, the owner of Dehe Pawnshop on Qiwu Pu Road and a wealthy merchant from Chaozhou, was kidnapped on December 12th of last year at around 8 a.m. near Donghai School on Liaoyang Road. He was hidden in the Shanghai Planting Garden on Xiangyin Road, and a large ransom was demanded. After the case was reported, Lu Liankui, the Chief Inspector of the General Inspectorate, along with Detectives Liu Shaokui and Wang Chengying, and Detective Qian Xianting, successively arrested nine people, including Dong, Madam Zhu, men and women, who were separately escorted to the First Special District Court and detained for investigation. Yesterday, the Yulin Road Police Station sent Dong Xuezeng and his accomplices to the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that further investigation revealed that there were still accomplices at large in this case. Tang Yaodong admitted at the police station that after the Weng child was kidnapped to the garden, he went to Pudong three times to negotiate the ransom with representatives sent by his family, and obtained a sum of 8,500 yuan. The leader gave him some expenses to hand over to Dong Da to cover the expenses of supporting the hostage. Zhao Junda, a blind man, claimed to be a relative of Dong Da, and had visited the garden once to talk to the Weng child and reassure him not to worry. Xue Jinzhai admitted to receiving 200 yuan from the ransom money. Xue Chunhai did not arrive, and further detailed investigation is needed. Therefore, he requested an extension. Judge Jiang Shuzi interrogated each of the defendants and ordered them to be remanded for further review and rescheduling.</p>

Shi received over 1,000 yuan in payment for the goods but did not turn it over to the factory, using the excuse of going to Hankou to promote the goods. He left and never returned. Shi was hiding in Shanghai, indulging in pleasure. Yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., Lin bumped into him on the road and called the police to take him to the Yimiao Police Station for investigation. After questioning by Chief Liu, the defendant Shi Baoshan made excuses to prevaricate. The case involves the plaintiff's accusation of embezzling account funds, violating criminal law. He was sentenced and sent to the bureau for legal action.</p>

<p>Tan Zhuohong, a former judge of the Criminal Court of the Shanghai Local Court, and lawyer Yang Shaopeng, etc., were accused of soliciting bribes. The victims reported the case to the Ministry of Justice. The Ministry of Justice ordered Zhong Shangbin, the Chief Prosecutor of the Court, to first arrest and detain lawyer Yang and then place Judge Tan under supervision, assigning a supervising judge to escort Tan and Yang to the Wuxian Local Court in Suzhou for investigation and trial. This information has been reported in various newspapers. It is now learned that lawyer Yang Shaopeng is a native of Jiangyin and joined the Shanghai Bar Association as a member in June of the 17th year of the Republic of China. He organized a specialist office at No. 20, Lane 150, Baker Road in this city and practiced law in Shanghai. However, he has an opium addiction. After being detained, his opium cravings flared up. He negotiated with the guards, produced his license, and requested to eat. As a result, he was still rejected. He has now been sent to Suzhou. His wife, Yang Chen Xiuying, has been running around to seek rescue since her husband was detained but has not achieved her goal. She also sent a letter to the Shanghai Lawyers' Association, the content of which was roughly, "My husband has been falsely accused and has been arrested and detained. Please help to rescue him." It is heard that the Association replied to Yang Chen Xiuying, stating that since the court is already in the process of investigation, the case should be judged by the court, and the Association is not in a position to interfere.</p>

<p>Dong Rongkang, a 45-year-old man from Ningbo, has been running a pastry shop at No. 12, Luban Road in the Chinese Concession. On the 10th at 7 p.m., Dong was passing through Huage Nie Road in the French Concession when he was seen by the gangster woman Ye Ayu, (25 years old, from Ningbo). Thinking that Dong could be deceived because he was from the countryside, she went up to Dong and said, "We are familiar with each other. Why don't you come to my house to play today?" Dong vaguely refused. After walking a few steps, more than ten gangsters suddenly rushed out, dragged Dong into Hongyun Lane, and beat him. They then extorted five yuan from him before dispersing in a panic. Dong reported the case to the Songshan Road Police Station. Detective Li Binchang was ordered to arrest Ye Ayu and the assailants Chen He Biao and Feng Aju. They were yesterday taken to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. First, the police lawyer Chen Ming stated the case, requesting another review on a later date. When questioned, Ye Ayu confessed that the woman knew the plaintiff when she worked as a tea server in the New World. At that time, the plaintiff owed me eighteen cents. Now, I met him on the road and asked for it. He voluntarily gave me five yuan in national currency and dragged me to the inn. Because the woman refused to agree, there was an argument. I did not dare to demolish the shop. When Chen He Biao and Feng Aju were questioned, they both confessed that the civilians went forward to dissuade him and did not commit any acts of violence or demolition. Judge Wang ordered another review on the 16th. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

Therefore, after 7 a.m., he arrived at the court and signed in first. By 8 a.m., the prepared sign-in book had been sent to the Court President's office, so staff who arrived at the court slightly later were unable to sign in.

<p>Since the Shanghai Telephone Company implemented a per-call charging system, it has been very difficult for litigants in various courts in this city to use the telephone when they encounter urgent matters. Therefore, the Shanghai Lawyers Association, in order to facilitate lawyers and litigants, has proposed a joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees, which resolved to send a letter to various courts in this city, requesting the installation of public telephones specifically for the use of lawyers and litigants. The cost will also be paid by the users on a per-call basis, which will not increase the court's expenses and will also increase convenience for litigants. This is a win-win situation. Yesterday, the Association drafted an official letter and submitted it to the Standing Committee for signature and stamping, and sent it separately to the Second and Third Branch Courts of the Jiangsu High Court, the Shanghai Local Court, and the First and Second Special District Local Courts, requesting that they adopt and install public telephones.</p>

<p>The Industry is Suffering and Unable to Cope, A Letter is Sent to the City Federation Requesting an Announcement.</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the flower industry in this city is now being forced to pay a deposit for telephones after the telephone company implemented the new system. The industry is suffering and unable to cope. Yesterday, they sent a joint letter to the First Special District Citizens' Federation for assistance. The letter reads, "We humbly report that due to the new telephone regulations and the per-call charges, the industry is burdened by harsh rules. In the current economic downturn and the industry's declining business, we are unable to cope. In addition, the telephone company recently sent staff to each house to forcibly collect a deposit of 60 yuan per telephone. The industry has repeatedly discussed methods of resistance, but the company ignores them and continues with its one-sided policy. The industry has no choice but to request that the telephones be removed. For the sake of prudence, we are sending this letter by registered mail with return receipt, which we received several days ago. However, the company has still not sent anyone to remove the telephones. We don't know why. We earnestly request that your Federation publish the industry's difficulties in the newspaper. We believe that your Federation will spare no effort to help the industry. We are eagerly awaiting your approval."</p>

<h3 id="e121">The Public Bus Company in the International Settlement's Revised Fare Regulations Approved by the Engineering Bureau <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that the Public Bus Company in the International Settlement has revised its fare regulations due to the use of new fractional currency in China. It is said that it has been approved by the Engineering Bureau. According to an employee of the company, the new regulations can now be implemented, but because the daily revenue of new fractional currency is only about 250 yuan, it is planned to implement the new regulations after the revenue greatly increases. It is expected that the increase will be gradual. The Public Works Department fully approved the new regulations submitted by the company this time, without making any modifications. The new regulations do not increase the fare. The new fractional currency is equivalent to three old copper coins, and the current fare is not divided by "three", so it has to be revised. Some of the fares are slightly increased, and some are slightly reduced. For example, the fare for Route 1, which is ten cents, has to be changed to nine cents, which is equivalent to three new fractional currency. However, in order to compensate for the loss of income, the two fares are calculated based on the converted new fractional currency, which has slightly increased. The company predicted several weeks ago that the new regulations could be implemented on March 1, but based on the current situation, it is not likely to be implemented in the near future. The implementation of the new regulations will inevitably be a bit troublesome at the beginning. Therefore, the managers hope to implement them after the new fractional currency is widely used. The new fractional currency is indeed more convenient than the old copper coins. It is lighter and easier for passengers to carry, and it can also reduce the weight on the ticket seller's shoulders by two-thirds. Although the company currently only receives 250 yuan of new fractional currency per day, the number is still small, but it has increased compared to several weeks ago, which proves that the number of users has gradually increased.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Cai Zengji Discusses the Reorganization of the China Merchants Bureau's Debts, Rumors Are Not True <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that reporter met Cai Zengji, the Director-General of the state-owned China Merchants Bureau, at the Municipal Government yesterday to discuss the issue of reorganizing the old debts of the Bureau. According to him, the Bureau is currently studying a fundamental solution to the reorganization of old debts in detail. After the plan is drafted and submitted to the central government for approval, it will be published in writing. This matter is of great importance and cannot be announced casually orally. As for the amount of old debts, he said that the total amount of principal and interest is about 39 million yuan. Among them, the principal and interest owed to the British HSBC Bank is about 13 million yuan, and the principal and interest owed to the American Citibank is about 1.5 million yuan. The remaining debts are owed to domestic banks and money shops, and a small part is for guarantees and employees' savings. Therefore, the content is very complex. The foreign debt part is related to China's foreign debt credibility and diplomatic issues between China and the creditor countries, as well as financial issues. The domestic debt part is also of great importance to the domestic economy, social finance, and the government's credibility to the people. However, in any case, the most reasonable and fair principles will be followed in the future, and the economic, diplomatic, and credit relations of all parties, as well as the economic capabilities and shipping plans of the China Merchants Bureau itself, will be taken into consideration, and detailed measures will be formulated to seek a thorough solution. Cai concluded that since the relations of this matter are as complex as described above, it will take a considerable amount of time to study and agree on it.</p>
<h3 id="e125">All Parties Support and Unanimously Promote Commercial Ethics, China-China Silk and Satin Company Takes the Lead and Loudly Calls for Action <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Trustworthiness is the foundation of commercial ethics, hence the ancient Chinese saying "Trustworthiness leads to commerce." However, in recent years, due to fierce commercial competition, most people only seek immediate benefits and disregard their own credibility. Furthermore, there is a lot of infighting and jealousy among peers. The two words "trustworthiness" are no longer valued by merchants today, and commercial ethics have been completely destroyed. The China-China Silk and Satin Company, in view of this, deeply feels that it is necessary to improve commercial ethics in order to achieve the permanent survival of various industries. Therefore, it sent a letter to the Silk and Satin Industry Association of this city the day before yesterday, requesting that it forward the letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. On the one hand, it should persuade all industries to establish a unified market price, create mutually beneficial industry rules, and jointly abide by them. On the other hand, it should submit a request to the government authorities to take concrete and effective measures to ban exaggerated and false advertisements and broadcasts that undermine commercial peers and damage commercial ethics. In this way, a permanent foundation can be established for the future of industry and commerce. It is heard that after the China-China Company issued the letter, the Silk and Satin Industry Association forwarded it to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce is also considering implementation measures, and industry leaders are also paying close attention to it. Therefore, the promotion of commercial ethics may become a new movement in the industrial and commercial sectors. (The original letter from China-China Silk and Satin Company to the Silk and Satin Industry Association has been seen in yesterday's newspaper and is omitted here.)</p>

<h3 id="e155">Overview of the Literacy Campaign in Fujian Province <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The literacy campaign in Fujian Province began in 1932 and has been going on for three years with considerable success. The process can be divided into three periods: initiation, promotion, and compulsion. A detailed description follows:</p>
<p>Initiation Period</p>
<p>The implementation of literacy education in Fujian Province actually started in 1929. Due to lack of funding, not many schools were established. In 1932, Zheng Zhenwen, Director of the Department of Education, returned to Fujian to preside over educational administration. Recognizing the need to intensify literacy education, he proposed to the provincial government to organize a Popular Literacy Education Committee to handle literacy education affairs specifically. It was jointly organized by social education organizations and social groups in the provincial capital and directly under the provincial government. At the beginning of the program, publicity work was carried out first, followed by a survey of illiteracy in the city. At the same time, the Literacy Association established public schools, totaling ninety-four schools with one hundred and seventy-seven classes. Classrooms of public and private schools and public institutions were used as teaching venues, and illiterate people were notified to attend school. A total of 5,668 people enrolled in these schools. As for the teaching staff, they were filled by civil servants from various agencies and teachers from various schools, all on a voluntary basis, without subsidies. The first phase was from April to August, and a graduation test was held. As a result, 2,503 people graduated. The second phase of public schools started in September. School establishment plans gradually shifted from cities to the surrounding rural areas. Five central public schools were established in the five police districts of the provincial capital, each responsible for the administrative matters of their respective districts. A total of 110 classes were established, with over 4,500 students enrolled. Unfortunately, only two months after the start of classes, the Fujian Incident occurred, and all schools were suspended. The Literacy Association was also affected and suspended operations. This was the first phase of the literacy campaign in Fujian Province.</p>
<p>Promotion Period</p>
<p>In January 1934, the Fujian Incident was quelled. Zheng Zhenwen, Director of the Department of Education of the newly established provincial government, resumed his post, and the Popular Literacy Association was also restored on February 22. The name was changed to the Fujian Provincial Popular Literacy Committee, under the Department of Education, with a committee of seven members. In addition to the Director of the Department of Education serving as the chairman, the remaining members were appointed by the Department of Education. Immediately, the second phase of public schools continued, but after a survey, only sixty-one schools were deemed capable of opening classes, with over 1,800 students. By the time of the graduation test, 1,623 students had passed. The third phase of public schools was extended to the thirteen autonomous districts under the jurisdiction of Minhou County. A total of ninety-seven schools were established throughout the county, with some schools running two levels. In total, there were one hundred and nine classes. The teaching staff was generally appointed by the Literacy Association and started classes in March. A total of 4,940 students enrolled. By the end of July, after the test, 3,487 students graduated. The fourth phase of public schools began in September 1934. In addition to continuing to establish schools in Minhou County, the program was also extended to Changle and Jian'ou Counties. At the same time, considering that Minhou County had already run three phases of public schools and had many graduates, higher-level public schools were selectively established in villages where schools had previously been established, so that the public could have opportunities for further education. A total of five senior public schools, four central public schools, and forty-six ordinary public schools were established in Minhou County, totaling sixty-nine schools. Three central public schools and twenty-two ordinary public schools were established in Changle County, totaling thirty-three classes. Ten ordinary public schools were established in Jian'ou County, totaling ten classes. In total, ninety-two schools were established, totaling one hundred and twelve classes. The number of students was 3,427 in Minhou County, 1,618 in Changle County, and 437 in Jian'ou County, totaling 5,482. The program was completed in January 1935. The number of graduates was 2,302 in Minhou County, 1,012 in Changle County, and 257 in Jian'ou County, totaling 3,571. The fifth phase of public schools began in March 1935 and was further extended to Fuqing and Lianjiang Counties. Only senior classes and children's classes were held in Minhou County. The establishment of public schools in Jian'ou County was temporarily suspended. Schools were still established in Changle County. A total of eleven schools were established in Minhou County, running eighteen classes, with 844 students. Sixteen schools were established in Changle, running thirty-five classes, with 1,732 students. Seventeen schools were established in Fuqing County, running twenty-two classes, with 1,003 students. Nine schools were established in Lianjiang County, running thirteen classes, with 639 students. In total, fifty-three schools were established in various counties, running eighty-eight classes, with a total of 4,218 students. In July 1935, a graduation test was held, and the program was reported as completed. The total number of graduates was 611 in Minhou County, 1,162 in Changle County, 819 in Fuqing County, and 570 in Lianjiang County, totaling 3,162. The establishment of schools by the Popular Literacy Association came to an end at this point. Later, the association was ordered to carry out compulsory literacy work, entering another stage. According to statistics, the association ran five phases of public schools, establishing a total of 446 schools, with 596 classes and 19,346 graduates.</p>
<p>Compulsory Period</p>
<p>Since this method had no precedent, it could be promoted. To ensure smooth implementation, it should be tested first, to serve as a future standard for implementation. The Literacy Association began implementing compulsory literacy throughout the province last August and has been doing so for six months. Thirteen villages in the third district of Minhou and the fourth district of Changle were designated as pilot areas, and personnel were dispatched to handle them separately. Except for the third district of Minhou, which has already ended, with 4,126 people receiving compulsory literacy, the pilot area in Changle is still ongoing. As for the counties and cities in this province that have been ordered to implement compulsory literacy, they have all actively promoted it. As of the end of January 1936, a total of thirty-eight counties and cities and one special zone had established schools to implement compulsory literacy, running 1,681 schools. Excluding the 461 schools that did not report the number of students enrolled, it is known that over 56,000 people are enrolled. Seventeen counties and one special zone are also preparing to open classes by the end of February. Only eight counties and one special zone have not yet established public schools.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Pinjia of this city has specially organized a Public Education Group. Scholars only need to have five or more people. The required subjects, times, and locations can be communicated to the group by letter, and teachers will be dispatched to teach in accordance with the agreement. Lectures are prepared for each subject. The group's address is No. 24, Yuehua Fang, Jingzhou Road, Huade Road.</p>

<p>China in times of crisis faces two major problems: one is the direction of national defense economic policy, and the other is the cultivation of youth. The recently published "Cultural Construction," Volume 2, Issue 6, focuses on discussing these two problems. Regarding the former, there are papers by Professors Liu Zhendong and Zheng Shubu. Regarding the latter, there are five essays, all of which study these problems from a theoretical perspective. In addition, there are many essays on land and rural issues, such as Weng Zhizhen's "An Evaluation of the Problem of Village Ownership of Land," Zhang Jueren's "On the Reform of the Old Land System in China," Chen Yun's "Disaster Relief Policy and Public Granary System," Cheng Zhicheng's "An Analysis of the Inherent Organization of Chinese Rural Society and Its Evaluation," and Ji Hongfa's "The Reality of Debt Among Chinese Farmers." Organizing farmers and consolidating the rural economy is the primary task in building our national defense economy, so the publication of these essays in this issue also has special significance. It is reported that in view of the increasingly urgent international situation, the next issue of the journal will be a "Special Issue on International Political Economy," which will feature specially commissioned articles by experts on recent major international issues, such as the world panic, tariff policy, world trade, currency issues, silver issues, the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, the Sino-Japanese problem, the Italian-Ethiopian problem, the disarmament problem, and the re-division of colonies. It is hoped that this journal will provide readers with valuable reading and reference materials. In addition, the journal's monthly essay contest for April is themed "A Tragic History," which requires writers to extract the most tragic and moving episodes from historical facts in this country, and describe them in a way that is relevant to the present era. The length of the article should be two to three thousand words, and the deadline is March 25th.</p>

<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>It was only now that the greatest brilliance of the entire play was discovered. First, a thick rope was seen slapping on the stage, then suddenly it tightened and jerked, and Amy's voice was heard shouting, "Lift up, move forward!" Then the gruff voice of the Quartermaster Rice answered, "Steady—steady!" Followed by a burst of laughter, as four large gray mice appeared, their legs trembling, their tails rather peculiar, but their heads very dignified, their black whiskers looking lifelike. They: dragged—or were meant to look as if they were dragging—a tall, beautiful carriage, made from one half of that pumpkin king, placed on the wheels of Tandy's cart, the wheels being painted yellow to match the brightly colored carriage body. In the front seat was a happy little coachman, wearing a white wig, a towering hat, and red breeches and a lace-trimmed coat, whipping a long whip, tugging on several red reins, so vigorously that the four gray steeds stood up like people. This coachman was Tandy himself, he nodded and smiled at the guests, looking so funny that they gave him a round of applause; Aunt Laurie said, "If I could find such a serious coachman, I would hire him immediately." The carriage stopped, and the stepmother carried the little maiden up, and she sat high up, booming away, waving to the audience along the way, her glass slippers rising in front, and her scarlet skirt sweeping the ground behind her, because although the carriage was beautiful, the beauty sitting in it was already very cramped.</p>
<p>The next scene was a dance party, where Nan and May were dressed as splendidly as peacocks. Nan, playing the proud stepsister, was particularly well suited, and as she swept across the palace hall, she seemed to be able to overwhelm all the other beauties there. The prince, sitting alone on an unstable throne, gazed around from beneath a heavy crown, while twirling his sword or admiring the silk roses on his shoes. When he saw Cinderella enter, he jumped up and exclaimed in a rush, but also very warmly.</p>

In the early morning, the telegrams indicated that London's large bars were up 0.0625 for both near and far terms.

After opening, the near-term trend loosened slightly due to daily trading. The exchange rates announced by HSBC were unchanged for both British and US dollars. The overall trend remained stable, but limited transactions meant that there was little change in the process thereafter. The trend loosened further at noon, due to a lack of counterparties. Later, as the market stabilized slightly, banks engaged in slight swaps. The initial report on Indian silver showed an increase of 5 annas, with little change. Finally, the Indian silver price increased by another anna, but due to even more sluggish transactions, no changes occurred until closing.

<h3 id="e171">Securities: Maintained by Large Investors' Absorption, Public Bonds Rise Again, Unified Ding Bonds Rise the Most by $1.20 <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend in the Chinese Securities Exchange suddenly turned upward. Many believed that the situation in France and Germany had somewhat eased, and there was no immediate threat of a breakdown. Rumors about the Fujian situation had also subsided. Large investors were actively absorbing, while retail investors were mostly selling. Observing the price increases from various parties, it was only a momentary excitement, and difficult to sustain. The market still seemed fleeting. It is also reported that 340 million in Fuxing Public Bonds are planned to be traded as futures, which, if realized, would further crowd the market with chips, making the future less optimistic. Yesterday's activity saw significant buying of No. 4, No. 5, and No. 47 in the morning opening, with only scattered retail investors selling. The price of Class C bonds rose by as much as six dimes. The second session was slightly more stable, and the trend remained firm, with further increases of two or three dimes. In the afternoon opening, No. 55 and No. 75 and others took aggressive long positions, with strong buying. No. 4 took the opportunity to raise prices. Only No. 11 and Northern bonds saw more selling, with the rest being scattered spot market outflow. Ding bonds were suddenly raised by as much as nine dimes, with the rest also uniformly raised by three, five, or six dimes. The advances were sharp but quickly reversed, and the closing price uniformly fell back. No. 16 saw more selling, and buyers suddenly became quiet, uniformly retreating by one or two dimes to three and a half dimes. Currently, most sellers are those with goods, while most of those taking long positions are speculators. Therefore, occasional price increases are difficult to establish. Overall, yesterday's market results showed uniform increases ranging from six or seven dimes to one dollar and two dimes. The total transaction volume was 6,235,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that yesterday (the 11th), the New York stock market saw little change in the recently high-flying stocks. Secondary stocks, however, with their lagging prices, quickly caught up, rising sharply. Farm equipment stocks were particularly outstanding, soaring by about $6. At the close, oil stocks were very active, with Amerada Corporation jumping by $11.50. Chemical stocks were quite strong, and auto stocks were quiet but firm. Small exchange stocks rose under the leadership of Aluminum Company of America. Bonds rose across the board except for German bonds. The total daily trading volume was 2.19 million shares.

<p>The yarn market fell ten times in the morning. After a large increase the previous day, profit-takers started selling. At the same time, third-grade yarn fell back six or seven dimes. As a result, market sentiment slightly loosened, and the market situation slightly weakened. However, cash was extremely tight, and the financial sector absorbed at low prices. The yarn stock in Shanghai warehouses shrank, decreasing by more than 10,000 bales compared to last month. The cotton yarn itself can be considered consolidated.</p>
<p>Yarn is still perceived as tight this month.</p>
<p>The opening price of the marked yarn market in the morning was lower because the longs from the previous day released, and the situation turned loose. The Osaka third-grade yarn telegram showed a small decrease of a few dimes. The market price fell, but the situation in the current month is urgent because of the lack of spot yarn and the gradual increase in selling prices. Raw materials are expensive, and factories find it difficult to sell short. As a result, the market outlook is tighter, and shorts for distant months are still unwilling to cover and have slightly turned to fatigue. As a result, prices for each month fell by six, eight, nine dimes to one dollar and one dime compared to the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon opening market situation was still flat and weak. It was heard that spot yarn transactions were still good in the second and third sessions. The Osaka third-grade yarn result was only down six or seven dimes compared to the previous day. By closing, the market turned firm, and the results for each month rose by one, two, three, and four dimes compared to the morning closing price. Sold: Yuda 400 bales, Dafeng 1,000 bales, Hexing 950 bales, Changyu 400 bales, Shenji 950 bales, Yida 500 bales, Taixing 1,300 bales, Yongchang 700 bales, Mingde 1,050 bales, Xingchang 1,000 bales, Dachangcheng 500 bales. Bought: Daji 600 bales, Yifeng 2,150 bales, Changji 550 bales, Yichang 1,000 bales, Changfeng 1,500 bales, Xincheng 950 bales, Tongfu 550 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Marked Yarn  Highest Price  Lowest Price  Closing Price  Compared to Previous Day  Remaining Account</p>

<p>Total  293,650</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Prices are Firm</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. It has been found that various trading groups bought a total of 1,430 bales throughout the day. Selling prices are firm. The amounts bought by various trading groups are listed below:</p>
<p>Changsha 265, Tianjin 200, Inland 515, Wuhu 70, Jiangxi 70, Guangdong 130, Xiamen 15, Shantou 5, Anqing 20, Hankou 65, Peers 75</p>

<p>Without Large Imports of Foreign Cotton, Market Prices are Not Expected to Fall</p>
<p>After rising sharply, cotton has returned to level. Some longs have taken profits, and the market is selling off due to loosening chips. However, the condition of spot cotton is exceptionally tight, and inventory is dwindling. Unless large quantities of foreign cotton are imported, the future of the cotton market cannot be seen as bearish.</p>
<p>Longs Release Marked Cotton</p>
<p>The market opening for marked cotton saw all months fall by one or two dimes. American cotton continued to rise by six to nine points, Indian cotton was suspended, and Osaka third-grade cotton rose and fell by two or three dimes. The market situation was not tight because long positions were being liquidated. Yuanchangxing, on behalf of a large firm from Jun, sold 15,000 dan, causing the market to sell off due to abundant chips. However, Tongji continued to buy.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened, with all months unchanged to up five points. On the dealer side, seeing that cotton brokers in the warehouse sold about 10,000 bales of March contracts at 11.36 to 11.33, they could not help but feel disheartened. At the same time, there were also longs taking profits and cotton farmers hedging. Later, spot merchants actively bought, and foreign firms also entered. March short positions were covered, and market prices rebounded. New buying and selling were still lacking, and the market was waiting for developments in Washington and Europe. The closing was firm, with spot prices up six points and futures prices up one to nine points. British cotton spot prices were up nine points, and futures prices were up four or five points. Indian cotton was suspended. The original telegram is recorded on the left (March 11th telegram):</p>

<p>As of the end of February, the total yarn stock of Chinese, British, and Japanese factories in this city was 68,047 bales, a sharp decrease of 10,817 bales compared to the 78,864 bales at the end of January. Among them, Japanese factory yarn was 6,433 bales, a decrease of 3,024 bales compared to last month. Chinese and British yarn was 61,615 bales, a decrease of 7,793 bales compared to last month. The sharp decrease is due to the development of spring sales and the increasing buying power of cloth. (Yarn stored in yarn and cloth warehouses is also included in the calculation.)

<p>Price Increases by 2.5 to 3 Dimes, Overseas Wheat Prices Fluctuate Slightly</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of over 30 firms arrived with supplies (totaling over 7,000 piculs). Sales in this street were normal, but wholesale buying was very active. It is estimated that the Tianjin and Qingdao trading groups bought around 3,000 bags, so people are firmly bullish, and the market continues to rise. The price of thin rice actually rose by 2.5 to 3 dimes, but the price of early round-grain rice only increased by a few fen to 1.5 dimes. The price of Du Yang tip increased by a few dimes, and the price of Yinyuan Bianwu also increased by nearly a foot.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the weather was still overcast and rainy. 23 or 24 boats arrived from various rivers. The asking price for white round-grain rice was tight by one or two dimes in the morning market, but the buying appetite in the evening market was stagnant, and prices remained firm. Sales of thin rice were normal, and prices were high by one dime. Yangdu Buxian and other prices increased by about one dime. Bianwu increased by nearly a foot, Yinyuan increased by one or two dimes, and the price of customer tip was slightly tighter. The prices of all other goods were firm.</p>
<p>Overseas wheat prices are reported as follows:</p>

<p>The sales channel for red sorghum has been quite active recently because inland wine brewing sales have started to bud. Market transactions are becoming more lively. Currently, spot goods are insufficient, and the market is firm. Niuzhuang red shell has already risen to 4.02 yuan. Transactions of road goods that have thawed have opened at 3.85 yuan (seven cars were successfully transacted the day before). Yesterday, the market slightly fell by two fen. A total of 600 bags of spot goods and four cars of road goods were traded. The Shantou trading group continued to order over 40,000 pieces of each factory's four-brand soybean cake for delivery on April 15, and the price rose by two fen compared to the previous day, opening at 1.7 yuan. The overall trend remains tight. Soybeans were able to remain stable. Soybean oil only had transactions for road goods to be delivered in the future, so the market situation became stagnant.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Zhangzhou dispatch on orchid seeds stated that the winter water goods of Quanhuang Gaozhuang were already out of stock. Even at high prices, it was difficult to find supplies. Therefore, the goods arriving by ship recently were all common Zhuang varieties, with inferior color and fragrance, making them less suitable for sales. As a result, they were weak and had few buyers. There are hopes for good sales of high-grade goods stored in Shanghai in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Metals: Smoked Sheet Iron Prices Soar <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Recently, smoked sheet iron has been scarce due to thin arrivals and stock, and the market atmosphere has been very good. Customer groups and enamel factories, thermos bottle factories, etc., in this street have been adding to their purchases, so there have been quite a few transactions. Prices have soared, with each dan opening as high as nine yuan, a sharp increase of three or four dimes compared to the previous day. Transactions amounted to 600 or 700 dan. In addition, the price of 3.6-foot goods has remained the same because there are not many buyers and the stock in the market is thick.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Piece Goods: Mercerized Feather Yarn Supply and Demand are Both Strong, The Result of Domestic Factory Competition <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Domestic mercerized feather yarn is selling twice as well with the arrival of spring. Various Western clothing tailoring groups have made large purchases. The #3 and #4 goods are selling extensively. However, the selling price is cheap. The cost of silk yarn raw materials used to weave this product has increased sharply, and there is no reason for it to fall. The reason for this is that there are too many small-scale machine households at sea, causing the products to be overstocked. Because they are smaller in scale, financial resources are often insufficient, so they all adopt a low-profit principle in order to compete for sales. This makes the market more and more fatigued. The group patterned mercerized feather yarn are all selling at four dimes, and fine patterned are four dimes and three fen.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Yuanfang Auction House Sales are Not Smooth <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Thursday, was the Yuanfang 2980th auction. 46 boxes of various goods were displayed. Because the weather was cold, customer sales were not smooth. There was no major change in Western satin. Yuanrong Tribute and Yuanfu silk both rose slightly. Feather silk rose by several dimes each. Foreign red and blue cloth also increased. The price of Qi cloth was the same as the previous one.</p>

<p>The lowest price of gardenia seeds in the spring market was only around nine yuan. Recently, due to a lack of arrivals and stock, there has been a sudden turnaround in tightness, and the goods with good color are particularly rare. It has been found that only 27 pieces were imported by Huaping from Quanzhou the day before. Because of the rain, they have not yet been placed on the dock. If they are high-grade Zhuang goods, they will definitely be popular. It is said that the asking price must be 13 yuan, a rise of more than two yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e186">German's Inspection of Sino-German Trade Talks <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Dispatch from the National Maritime News Agency, March 11: Dr. Klepp, head of the German Far East Economic Investigation Group, gave a speech at the Pan-Pacific Association in this city today on "The German Economic Situation." One section on Sino-German trade stated: "Although Germany is under import restrictions, it still imports large quantities of raw materials to meet the needs of industry, so that the unity and planning under the new economic policy can be realized. Due to the lack of foreign exchange, Germany's payment for raw materials purchased abroad relies solely on the export of industrial products to those countries. This is the reason why Germany's imports from certain countries are less or more than from other countries. Under this system, according to a report by the China Social and Economic Research Institute, the import of Chinese products to Germany increased by 45% from 1934 to 1935. We believe that the upward trend is still likely to continue. Currently, assuming that the production of raw materials in various countries around the world will always increase without end, and that Germany's export of industrial products is also sufficient to offset the import price of raw materials, the premise for implementing Germany's economic system can also be considered resolved."</p>

<p>— He Boxiong</p>
<p>Generally speaking, from January to May of last year, all exchange rates consistently rose. In June and July, the exchange market experienced a decline, starting with foreign banks and spreading downwards. The British exchange rate fell from 1 shilling 7 and 125/10000 pence to 1 shilling 6 and 75/100 pence, and the US exchange rate fell from 39.3125 US dollars to 36.75 US dollars. Around early August, there was a slight increase in trade exports and sluggishness in imports. Logically, there should have been changes in foreign exchange rates. However, for several months, the actual commercial exchange needs accounted for very little. The reason for this was that people were generally cautious about the future. Therefore, when London silver prices fell in mid-August, Shanghai exchange rates moved in the opposite direction, which was clearly due to the manipulation of powerful speculators. Since the implementation of the equalization tax in October of last year, the exchange rate has become detached from parity. Its fluctuations can be artificially controlled, and it only stabilized towards the end of the month. The exchange market was uneventful in September. In October, the key factor that could cause changes in exchange rates was the future of China's currency problem. Rumors of currency inflation and devaluation had been circulating for a long time, and were particularly intense in that month. The exchange rate of Shanghai against foreign currencies declined steadily amidst these rumors. The British exchange rate even decreased from 1 shilling 6 and 8125/10000 pence on October 1st to 1 shilling 2 and 75/100 pence on the 31st. The two-month forward price of the British exchange rate reached a low of 1 shilling 2 and 625/10000 pence. The US exchange rate fell from 38 and a half dollars to 30 and 3125/10000 dollars. The differences between the exchange rates before and after were more than 4 pence for the British exchange rate and more than 8 dollars for the US exchange rate. In early November, the British exchange rate decreased by half a penny per national currency unit, and the US exchange rate decreased by one US dollar per hundred national currency units. This was due to the Ministry of Finance's announcement on the 4th to cease the use of silver currency and ordering the three banks to buy and sell foreign exchange without restrictions. Article 6 of the Ministry of Finance's emergency decree stated: "In order to stabilize the exchange rate of legal tender against foreign currencies at the current price, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications shall buy and sell foreign exchange without restrictions" (Note 6). Therefore, from November 4th, the posted prices of the Central Bank, which are the official rates, were fixed at 1 shilling 2 pence for 1 yuan of legal tender for the British exchange rate, 29 and three-quarters US dollars for 100 yuan of legal tender for the US exchange rate, and 103 yuan of Japanese currency for 100 yuan of legal tender, without any changes. The following is a table summarizing the fluctuations of various exchange rates over the past year: (Note 7)</p>

<p>Gold Bar Market</p>
<p>The Shanghai Gold Bar Market sometimes has the power to influence the exchange market and finance. The changes in the gold market are often dramatic, especially in February and April. The following table shows the fluctuations in the gold market over the past year: (Note 8)</p>

<p>In January of last year, the gold market was extremely quiet. In February, gold prices steadily declined with very few rebounds. The highest price for the entire month was 978.7 yuan, and the lowest was 872 yuan. The difference in January reached a significant 106.5 yuan. The reasons for this sharp decline are: The US gold bar scheme was adjudicated, and the government largely won. The Ministry of Finance repeatedly encouraged silver imports. Rumors circulated that a Sino-British loan was about to be established. Overseas silver prices steadily increased. As a result, market prices fell below the 900 yuan mark. In March, the downward trend in gold prices continued unabated. One reason was that countries using gold deliberately manipulated methods to lower the value of their currencies. Another reason was that China's outflow of silver currency was too large, forcing it to purchase silver in London and sell gold bars in Shanghai. As a result, the gold market plunged sharply, only to stabilize in the middle of the month. In the last ten days of the month, Sassoon, a British merchant, suggested issuing Shanghai pound bonds with British loans, and the US banker Thomas's silver amendment was rejected by the House of Representatives. In addition, there was a shortage of chips in the gold market, creating a short squeeze situation. Gold prices rose sharply, approaching the 890 yuan mark. In April, a reaction occurred again, and gold prices fell again. The daily difference also increased from more than 10 yuan to more than 30 yuan. On the 25th, rumors spread that the US government officially raised silver prices, and the downward trend became even more severe, with a sharp drop of 30 yuan in one day. The lowest price in the gold market for that month was 741.5 yuan, which was the first new low since the settlement price of customs gold in the previous year. In May, the market situation showed a revolving trend. The highest gold price was the closing price of 801.7 yuan on the 8th, and the lowest price was 749.8 yuan on the 18th. Throughout the month, gold prices fluctuated between 750 yuan and 800 yuan. In June, it hovered around 770 yuan. In the last ten days of the month, the market situation suddenly turned upward, breaking through the 800 yuan mark on the 22nd. This was due to the Central Bank's shipment of gold for export and rumors of currency inflation. In July, August, and September, there were no special changes in gold prices. In October, the gold exchange experienced a frenzy unprecedented in its history, rising from 879.2 yuan to 1211 yuan, a difference of 337.8 yuan. Although the Central Bank tried its best to maintain it, it was difficult to reverse the wild surge. In the last few days of the month, rumors spread that China's currency reform would be implemented in early November, and there was talk that the customs gold unit would soon be raised to 2 yuan 5. Large investors bought aggressively, and retail investors followed suit, pushing gold prices straight into the sky, reaching a new high of 1210 yuan on the 31st. In November, the events had already been implemented, and the gold market also lost its heroic posture (to be continued)</p>

<p>— Lin Shi</p>
<p>Professor Lu felt that he had rarely been so melancholic in recent years, and today he seemed to be experiencing the deepest taste of melancholy. He really couldn't stay in the house, he had to go for a walk outside no matter what. Moreover, he was a man without a family, and there was no woman to comfort him, so he felt particularly empty from morning to night. This emptiness could not be filled no matter how hard he paced back and forth, blowing smoke rings. The only opportunity was when the servant brought tea, and he really wanted to talk to him, but as soon as he saw his usual reserved and dull appearance, he simply couldn't talk to him for more than half a sentence, so he could only stare at him as he added some coal to the stove, and then stare at him as he silently, like a ghost, moved his two feet straight out of the room. And even the bit of vitality that he had just brought in was still taken away, leaving only the slight cracking sound of the coal in the stove. This made Professor Lu turn from melancholy to anger, and he angrily threw the half-smoked cigarette on the ground and stomped it out, as if smoking was what was making him annoyed. He immediately and nimbly put on his overcoat and prepared to go out. But turning around, he saw the cigarette butt he had just extinguished, which would inevitably dirty the floor, and it was a pity to waste most of the cigarette, so he calmly picked it up and put it on the table, then straightened his back and walked out the door.</p>
<p>Coming out of the door, he still felt melancholic, and it seemed that the streetlights were also much dimmer tonight. The north wind blew hard on his face, and he had to shrink his head into the collar of his cloak.</p>
<p>He walked a long way and turned many corners, but he had not yet decided where to go. Soon, a Beijing opera theater was nearby, so he bought a seat and went into the theater. Sure enough, it was very lively inside, and the atmosphere was very different from outside. Just the joyful expressions of the audience and the smoke were enough to warm up the place. But before long, he regretted coming in. There were many reasons: for example, the drums and cymbals on the stage were so noisy that they almost pierced his eardrums. Usually, he always felt that he could relax in the theater, but today he hated that the musicians were deliberately making trouble for him. And the audience members coughed incessantly, their foreheads and necks strained. They used various postures and sounds to compete to spit phlegm, spitting here and spitting there, as if they had originally agreed to spend money to come here to spit phlegm, otherwise it would not be worth spending money for nothing. This made Professor Lu sigh several times, indicating that he was really annoyed. There were also many women who were desperately cracking melon seeds, enjoying the jokes of the clowns on stage, not understanding Professor Lu's melancholy mood at all, which also made him very angry. In short, the people here were indifferent to Professor Lu, no one comforted him, no one paid attention to him, as if he did not exist in the world at all, but he thought this was very wrong. Of course, he was also quite able to sympathize with himself, and he wanted to say to the people next to him:</p>
<p>"Hey! Today I read the foreign newspapers in Shanghai, and my brother was beaten to death, that's right. You know he was very young, and he really shouldn't have died." But would the listener sympathize with him? No, he guessed right; besides, everyone sitting there was someone he didn't know.</p>
<p>He angrily walked out of the theater, because he believed that he would definitely not find any comfort here. The only way was to talk to Mr. Zhou, who he usually associated with most closely. He walked west, not forgetting that Mr. Zhou lived in a hutong on the edge of the department.</p>
<p>The wind was still blowing, but at least it wasn't raining.</p>
<p>Along the way, Professor Lu felt more and more sad; his brother's bloody head was vaguely in front of him. Thinking of this, he almost cried.</p>
<p>When he arrived at Mr. Zhou's study, Mr. Zhou was busy writing at his desk, and casually let him sit down next to him. Because there was a fire in the room, he took off his overcoat and sat down, without saying a word. Afterwards, Mr. Zhou put down his pen, turned around and said to him:</p>
<p>"These days, while the students are on strike, I want to finish my political theory. I've already written three-fifths of it. But I'm busy writing all day long, and my hands hurt."</p>
<p>Professor Lu didn't answer a word, just listened. Then Mr. Zhou said again:</p>
<p>"What's wrong with you? How do you spend your time these days? While school is not in session, you don't write anything, and staying in the house is also boring."</p>
<p>"Hmm!"</p>
<p>"Yesterday I played cards once," Mr. Zhou said again, "My luck wasn't bad, I won twenty-some dollars."</p>
<p>"Hmm." Professor Lu was always "hmm," which disappointed Mr. Zhou, and he turned around again to write his lecture notes, it seemed that he had to finish writing them tonight. Leaving Professor Lu staring blankly at the fire in the stove. Because he was too close to the stove, his legs were burned painfully. This made him think of the stove at home, and when he left, he forgot to tell the servant to turn it off. Burning until now, it must have been a waste. He thought he had to go home, but he was determined to come and talk to Mr. Zhou, how could he run back without saying a word? He lit a cigarette, and after smoking for a long time, Mr. Zhou was still busy writing his lecture notes and ignoring him. Looking at his watch, it was almost half past ten, and he finally spoke to Mr. Zhou:</p>
<p>"Hey, my brother was recently beaten to death."</p>
<p>"Oh? Do you still have a brother?" Mr. Zhou didn't turn around, still writing non-stop.</p>
<p>Professor Lu decided to go home immediately, and perhaps only his servant could sympathize with him. He quickly walked onto the road home. Walking, without joy or sorrow, only a slight resentment.</p>
<p>This person seeking sympathy thought of his dead brother, and also thought of the unextinguished fire at home; the anger in his heart was burning.</p>

<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>— Northern Sketch Two —</p>
<p>The tide slowly recedes, and the sea gradually thins. Previously submerged reefs now jut out jaggedly, revealing their dark green or reddish-brown forms, like a group of sea creatures sunning their backs in the early morning light.</p>
<p>Sun Da-hanzi walked along the Houhai embankment, glanced at the bay, and quickly quickened his pace. The wet sand on the uneven pavement splashed up behind his heels. He usually didn't pay attention to clocks, and neither he nor his neighbors could afford such luxuries, but he could gauge the days and times by the tides that regularly rose and fell outside his door.</p>
<p>Walking with him was a neighbor on his way to the Dongyang Abattoir to slaughter cattle. He wore several sharp knives slung across his body with a leather belt and long rubber boots on his feet. (If his clothes weren't stained with cow blood, he would look quite like a general.) A short pipe was clamped in the corner of his mouth as he trudged along, saying that once the American naval pier on the Houhai embankment was completed, foreign soldiers would disembark here, and he'd bet everything would improve. If his friends chipped in, they could open a deli and get the rotten beef scraps and blood from the company, stew it for the rickshaw pullers serving the foreign soldiers – that would be something! Though his words were like the casual morning banter, saying whatever came to mind, ultimately, he subtly wanted to leave the company, be his own boss, and run a small business. Sun Da-hanzi wasn't interested in this. He worked for a foreign fishing company, and even if he ever dreamed, it was nothing more than returning to the days when he sailed a boat with two crewmen to Jiaozhou Bay and the farther reaches of the sea to make a living fishing. Besides, the sea's appearance and the tide's retreat were telling him it was getting late, so naturally, he wasn't in the mood to listen to his neighbor's idle talk.</p>
<p>"Hey, what's the rush? If you go too early, they might not even be open yet."</p>
<p>"What do you mean? Look over there, it's going to be late today!"</p>
<p>As Sun Da-hanzi hurried along, he waved toward the bay on the side of the road, signaling his neighbor to look at nature's clock.</p>
<p>But his neighbor, though living by the sea and close to it, was unfamiliar with the sea's nature. He casually followed Sun Da-hanzi's pointing direction, took the short pipe from his mouth, and tapped off the ashes.</p>
<p>Near the sea, the American naval pier had just erected many cement pillars in the water. Beside it, a small mechanical tugboat was pulling a string of iron dredgers, which looked like many turtles constantly emerging from the water.</p>
<p>Further away, small boats with tea-brown sails, filled with morning wind, were laden with foreign goods, taking advantage of the receding tide to sail out of the bay.</p>
<p>Everything was much the same as usual, and he couldn't see the significance of what Sun Da-hanzi was pointing at. But there was no need to rush and listen to him for a detailed explanation, because he had long been accustomed to it and was no longer surprised. Since pawning his boat and nets, this gloomy fisherman had taken to saying things that made no sense. Moreover, he was just chatting casually, passing the time along the way, so why bother calculating anything else?</p>
<p>So, seeing Sun Da-hanzi leave him behind, he immediately started talking about something else with another person nearby.</p>
<p>The foreign fishing company was on the edge of the small port. Several small boats called "Something-Maru" were lined up one after another in front of the door. Some short, stocky foreign fishermen, wearing dirty white towels tied around their heads and long rubber boots on their feet, were busy hauling fish and ice from the hold. Chinese coolies carried the boxes, two men per box, from the ship to the company, like a colony of ants moving house.</p>
<p>Everyone was extremely busy, except for a short, thin middle-aged man wearing leather riding boots, whose attitude was very relaxed. He would stand on the shore or in the aisle, holding a straight wooden stick, using it to tap the tips or sides of his riding boots.</p>
<p>Sun Da-hanzi ran up to him, wiping the sweat from his forehead with the fishy sleeve of his shirt, and anxiously explained that the reason he was late was that his wife and children were sick, and he had to stay home for a while. He hoped to be forgiven and not have his wages deducted.</p>
<p>"Oh, your wife and young master are sick," the thin, short man squinted at Sun Da-hanzi. "Why did you even come to work? You should have stayed home to take care of them." With that, he walked to the aisle by the door.</p>
<p>Seeing that he wasn't angry, Sun Da-hanzi didn't mind that his words didn't sound right. He walked straight in, intending to start working. But the thin, short man placed his stick across the doorway and said coldly:</p>
<p>"Why don't you listen? I told you to go home."</p>
<p>Then, he raised his voice:</p>
<p>"Move aside, move aside, look, you're bumping into people!"</p>
<p>He then quietly walked to the shore, continuing to tap the tips of his riding boots with the wooden stick.</p>
<p>Sun Da-hanzi followed behind him, pleading in a low voice, while thinking angrily: This three-inch runt, I could knock him into the sea with one punch. But he also understood that what threatened him by this harbor wasn't this small thing, but something bigger and more terrifying, like a demon, which he couldn't express. So he had to bend over and say pitiful things to this little thing.</p>
<p>The thin, short man remained cold and calm, without any sign of anger. When the giant's lowered forehead was about to touch his shoulder, he squinted and said:</p>
<p>"You should take a day off to rest, or else you'll get sick too, like your wife and young master."</p>
<p>Sun Da-hanzi could only force a bitter smile.</p>
<p>"Sir, don't joke around. We poor people will go hungry if we don't work for a day."</p>
<p>The thin, short man walked away along the shore. Sun Da-hanzi still lowered his head and followed him.</p>
<p>"Sir, please do a good deed. My wife and son, uh, are so sick they can't get up, they might even... (his voice choked up) let me work for one day, even if it's just half a day's wage, uh, please?"</p>
<p>The thin, short man's heart twitched, but he saw that there were fewer fishing boats at the dock this morning, so there was less work than usual. Why add another person? He walked away a few steps in silence, without looking at the giant beside him.</p>
<p>Several Koreans, wearing unclean white clothes and skirts, carrying small tin buckets, walked down the dock to call for a small boat. They were going to the island to collect oysters and seaweed, laughing and chatting lightly along the way.</p>
<p>The thin, short man stared at them, and even when their boat was already floating in the harbor, he hadn't looked away for a while.</p>
<p>Sun Da-hanzi tried his best to suppress his choked voice.</p>
<p>"Sir, there's not a single copper left in my house... and... and I can't borrow any... I must earn some wages today to go home and buy... buy medicine."</p>
<p>The thin, short man suddenly forgot himself, touched Sun Da-hanzi's waist like an old friend, and said:</p>
<p>"Look, which one of those bitches is pretty?"... Damn it, why don't you sit down? Huh, you must be flashing your waist."</p>
<p>When he finished the last two sentences, his eyes looked back at the harbor. One of the Korean women on the boat was the youngest and had a plump face. She hadn't been sitting down and was suddenly swayed by the boat twice, causing her body to lean to the side. The women on the boat burst into laughter. The laughter and the fishy sea breeze were carried together.</p>
<p>Sun Da-hanzi couldn't help but raise his head and look in that direction, but his eyes were a little moist, and he couldn't see anything clearly. He could only see some blurred shadows of boats coming and going on the water.</p>

<p>— Wei Zhongtian</p>
<p>Although my body can't be said to be very good, in the past two or three years, despite going hungry many times, being frightened many times, smelling the stench of purple blood in corpses, and hearing various cries from hell, I haven't had a single illness, which is something to be thankful for amidst misfortune. I often feel comforted by this.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, I recently had a minor illness. However, since it's just called an "illness," it can't be called "misfortune," can it? After all, in this day and age, illness or hunger is very common for the poor. As a joke, "illness might be beneficial to the poor, because being sick for three or five days can save three or five days' worth of food." But this only applies to a "minor illness." If it's a major illness, that won't do, because a major illness requires going to the hospital, but where will the medical expenses come from?</p>
<p>To be honest, if a person is idle without work and has a poor life, then a minor illness or two is indeed not a bad thing. A "minor illness," of course, doesn't require seeing a doctor or taking medicine. Quietly hiding in bed provides a better opportunity to reflect on the past and future. Past: Where and when did I get hit by the enemy's hidden arrow? When did I get bitten by a dog?… Future: When will the world change color? When will people stop eating people's blood?… Only during a minor illness, repeatedly reflecting on these things, does a different kind of feeling bury itself in the heart.</p>
<h3 id="e194">On Utopian Novels <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Zhiying</p>
<p>"Utopian novels" occupy a significant position in modern literary history. Books such as Morris's "News from Nowhere," Sinclair's "The Millennium," and Jack London's "The Iron Heel" have already been introduced to China, and there are similar works in our own country, such as Zhang Tianyi's "Ghost Earth Diary" and Lao She's "Cat Country."</p>
<p>As an important genre in literary phenomenon, it is worthy for us to study. We should look at the essence of utopian novels (utopian fiction) from the basic point of view of society, and then we can criticize the value of utopian novels. Moreover, we must limit the scope of discussion here, that is, the utopian novels we are talking about are social utopian novels. Things like "Journey to the West" or the Tang people's "Travels of the Immortals" are not within the scope of our discussion.</p>
<p>In the development history of social utopian novels, Morris of England is a typical author. Morris was born in England in the second half of the nineteenth century. In the 1860s and 1870s, British bourgeois society still preserved a lovely "stability" and flashed the brilliance of the "Golden Age." Therefore, Morris as a writer was an artistic aesthete. But in the 1880s, because of the impact of emerging bourgeois countries such as Germany and the United States, the British economy showed embarrassment. As a result, domestic class struggles were particularly obvious and sharpened. On this social economic foundation, Morris's aestheticism also changed in the beauty of his works; this is because Morris's aestheticism was not combined with pure idealist mysticism. Reality has produced tragic darkness under the deformed system, and all development and freedom have become slaves to wealth and power. Morris knew that in such an environment, art would necessarily die out, because mankind was heading towards decline. Therefore, he developed a sense of revulsion towards this system. This revulsion prompted him to devote himself to the social movement, and he wanted to use beauty and art to encourage the development of the movement of the lower classes. However, as a member of the petty bourgeoisie, he could not resolutely take off the cloak of nostalgia for the past, and he still retained his past artistic paradise fantasy. Frieche aptly described this as "the intertwining of revolutionary and archaeological studies". This "intertwining" of dissatisfaction with the present, longing for the past, and fantasizing about the future is artistically reflected in his famous novel "News from Nowhere". In this novel, the symphony of a future society of freedom and equality and a handicraft society of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries is played, that is, the future society that appears in Morris's mind is a free paradise of agriculture and handicrafts in which machines and cities have disappeared. Needless to say, such a novel is "utopian", but it has a positive dynamic for transforming mankind.</p>
<p>After the World War, the social and economic situation deteriorated even further. Almost everywhere on earth was filled with the illusion of hunger and death, disease and distress. This was especially evident in Germany, which was the hardest hit. As a result, the petty-bourgeois intellectuals were burdened with heavy social despair and gave rise to a surrealistic psychology and hope. At this time, utopian novels were extremely popular. This tendency generally had a common point, that is, the fantasy that after the extinction of all mankind, a special remnant of people would recreate a beautiful paradise on earth. This is the "ideal world" of petty-bourgeois writers in the early twentieth century. Typical works of utopian novels at this time include Werner Scheff's "Stoker" in Germany, Sinclair's "The Millennium" in the United States, and Karel Čapek's "R.U.R." in Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>Werner Scheff's "Stoker" is entirely a manifestation of the "despair science" of the German petty bourgeoisie after the war. This novel tells how Germany was bound by the Treaty of Versailles after the war, but the national industry and technology have achieved unprecedented development. A genius technician invented a large submarine that could pass through the water for several days and nights. At the launching of the submarine in a public ceremony, a Japanese professor predicted that the world would be destroyed immediately, but people thought he was a madman. So the submarine was launched. After a day and night, the genius technician drove the submarine back to the port, but the mechanical propeller was taken away by the Japanese professor, and the people on the boat fell into urgent despair. After many troubles, the Japanese professor returned the propeller, and the boat floated to the surface. However, all living things on earth have been poisoned by the Japanese professor's prophecy and have completely died out! The French, the authors of the Treaty of Versailles, are all dead! The people who are fortunate enough to be saved at this time thank the Japanese professor and begin to build a new life on earth.</p>
<p>Sinclair's "The Millennium" is set in the United States. The "philosophy" expressed in this work is roughly similar to that of Werner Scheff. He writes that a great American tycoon has a towering building, a new type of mysterious aircraft, as well as an element that can destroy all living things on earth, and a food that can satisfy the stomach for a long time with a small amount. When the element that destroys all things is activated, the tycoon and his family are sitting in the plane, so they are not destroyed. When they come back, they start to live their lives on this desolate earth. People who have always been parasites now become the builders of the world. They go from a state of primitive chaos, through the feudal era, the capitalist era, and finally reach the era of the "republic", an era where you cannot eat if you do not work.</p>
<p>Karel Čapek's "R.U.R." also announced the extinction of mankind at the end. At that time, the petty bourgeoisie of Czechoslovakia was threatened by the progressive movement in Hungary, and dared not accept the real reality. Therefore, this progressive movement is entirely attributed to the abyss of destruction. But in this work, the beauty of nature and the undiminished power of human nature are finally proclaimed. In short, in Čapek's works, there is also the desire to return history to the earliest state of mankind before history, and to transform the inevitable struggle of human society into a religious morality of non-resistance.</p>
<p>In addition, the writer who has most completely preserved the classical utopian novels is the Swedish writer Modoza, Ido Ka. He has a utopian work called "The Modern Future Novel" "The Sun's", which describes the future world divided into five countries, controlled by fifty "She Wei Yi". His ideal is the "Trinity of Body, Reason, and Essence". Future people are all "Modozaists". The so-called "Modozaists" are those who try their best to "assimilate with great undertakings" the inherent positive characteristics of mankind - strength and will. His ideal is a mixture of Wilsonian democracy and the utopia of modern urban intellectuals, and even the compromise of Gilt's small business.</p>
<p>Social utopian novels have slightly different expressions in new literature. We can take Jack London's "Iron Heel" as a typical utopian novel for observation.</p>
<p>The main difference between this new utopian novel and the tradition of previous utopian novels is that it does not eliminate social struggle. As described above, past utopian writers all used technological development and the destruction of human ethics to destroy mankind, and then rebuild a "free paradise." This thought has been completely abandoned in the utopian novels of new literature. This is most clearly expressed in Jack London's "Iron Heel". In this work, social struggle is depicted in an abstract utopian form. Jack London's "Iron Heel" is almost entirely made with new economics, that is, economics that explains and reforms the existing system, as the foundation. In form, it is almost a propagandistic paper product. The form of this work, that is, the form of semi-utopian semi-fantasy, is mainly because the author does not deeply understand reality, and his subjectivity (for example, Jack London was originally an individualist and romanticist) contradicts what he theoretically recognizes, so he cannot depict social struggle in a more concrete image; he can only depict it in an abstract utopian form.</p>
<p>In our country, utopian novels like the ones mentioned above have not been seen. Works such as "Ghost Earth Diary" and "Cat Country," although in form adopt utopian novels, are mainly satirical novels in content. Of course, in these works, we cannot grasp the concrete realistic understanding of art, although there are achievements in some parts. This is a utopian satirical novel related to the lineage of "Gulliver's Travels".</p>
<p>According to Matcha's analysis, this kind of utopian novel is not useful for new literature. Because it hides the absoluteness and immutability of human "nature".</p>
<p>Standing on the new world view of realism, of course, this subjective creative method should be abandoned. But if we say that this kind of utopian novel is of no use to us at all, it is too general a statement. What we abandon is mainly the utopian novelist's aspect of recognizing reality. We want to create new works with "utopian" elements, works that are consistent with the development of reality, new "utopian novels".</p>

<h3 id="e195">Starting from the "Jewish Hotel" <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>As long as racial prejudice is not eradicated, conflicts between humans will be difficult to eliminate. The German exclusion of Jews is truly without limit! Since the National Socialist Party came to power in Germany, Jews residing in Germany have been repeatedly excluded. The oppression and humiliation suffered by Jews at the hands of Germans is truly unspeakable. But what can be done about it? Under violent oppression, the weak can only swallow their anger. Moreover, Jews are pitiable people who have lost their homeland!</p>
<p>Haven't we seen another insult now? A new hotel has recently been opened in Hanover, Germany, which is exclusively for Jews to dine in. Because since the implementation of the Nuremberg Laws, it has been extremely difficult for Jewish families to hire servants. All tasks, such as purchasing and cooking food, must be done personally, which is very inconvenient. Therefore, the authorities have this facility to make up for it. However, this hotel does not allow Aryans to enter. Germany's ban on marriage between Aryans and Jews was legally stipulated and implemented long ago. Now, Aryans are not even allowed to eat with Jews in restaurants. This kind of discriminatory treatment is the ultimate in insult!</p>
<p>But what can insult do? The Germans claim to be God's chosen people, the most excellent people in mankind. Jews, needless to say, are inferior. How can inferior people be equal to excellent people? Moreover, in the eyes of Germans, Jews are still the worst people in society who commit the most crimes. Previously, a German police commander made a report, saying that according to German crime statistics, the number of crimes committed by Jews was the highest. Therefore, it is only natural that Jews are despised by Germans. Furthermore, Hitler also said that Jews live in Germany as if they were eating and trampling on the land, but they are not grateful to their masters and even forget their place, committing evil and doing wrong. This is even more unforgivable!</p>
<p>However, are Jews the only race that suffers humiliation? In fact, it is not correct to say that this humiliation originates from racial differences. It is better to think of it as a relationship of national strength. Jews are insulted because they have lost their country. China is insulted because its international status is low. Isn't Japan also of the yellow race, but how do they treat us?</p>
<h3 id="e196">A Street Without Color <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Family Member</p>
<p>Although it is a street, it lacks the color usually associated with streets, and its appearance is unique. Specifically, it lacks modern, exquisite buildings, large department stores with lavish window displays, and vibrant advertisements fluttering in the air, which usually drape the street in a more brilliant robe. Streets adorned with these man-made creations appear exceptionally magnificent. Even the people walking on the street seem quite leisurely, strolling with a slow pace, leisurely browsing the sights.</p>
<p>But this street is entirely different—a street without color.</p>
<p>Narrow and cramped, the walkways are composed of uneven pebbles and sandy soil. When it rains, water inundates it, the soil dissolves, and the pebbles are exposed, creating potholes everywhere. The road practically turns into a mire. Whenever I have to pass through it, even if it's not a very long distance, it often takes me half a day, as I have to watch where I step and be careful not to slip and fall. By the time I cross this street, my shoes are covered in mud. I can't help but develop an unconscious aversion to it—a street to be avoided. Yet, it is a street to be avoided that I traverse daily, at least twice a day. Because of this, I have gradually become very familiar with the people who live on the street and the street's condition over time.</p>
<p>Almost every time I pass by, I hear women cursing men, or habitually beating children, or children fighting and crying amongst themselves in groups, all kinds of noisy sounds. If you pause to observe a bit longer, a more exciting drama often unfolds before your eyes:</p>
<p>Perhaps in the morning, a woman rushes out of a low wooden house onto the street, her hair unkempt, disheveled and covering her forehead, her collar unbuttoned, revealing a glimpse of her pale chest.</p>
<p>“Heavens, the two chickens in the coop behind my house that were laying eggs have suddenly disappeared. It must be that short-lived gambling ghost, Sanxi Zi, who stole them!”</p>
<p>She shouts this as she hops, and storms into Sanxi Zi’s house next door to demand the stolen chickens back.</p>
<p>People gather around to gossip.</p>
<p>If neither side admits wrongdoing, a quarrel ensues, filled with vicious curses. If it still cannot be resolved, the men of both families are drawn into the fray. What starts as a quarrel between women often ends with physical violence between men, escalating out of control before it settles.</p>
<p>No one saw whether Sanxi Zi really stole the chickens, and of course, there is no evidence. However, the neighbors sympathize with the victim because Sanxi Zi is indeed a bad guy, notorious on the street. Everyone despises him because he is a burly fellow who doesn't bother to find work, but instead mooches around all day, living idly and gambling like crazy. But he has no income at all, so where does the money come from? Therefore, whenever anyone loses something, even if it wasn't Sanxi Zi, people are bound to suspect that he was involved. Sanxi Zi is not the only one living licentiously on the street. Everyone looks down on such people.</p>
<p>In this, I occasionally discover the expression of people's most sincere emotions and the dividing line between good and evil.</p>
<p>Driven by life, they show no signs of fatigue—perhaps their nerves are numb. Except for a few unruly individuals, everyone expresses regret or sighs when they talk together. Everyone earnestly and bravely faces the whip of life, toiling relentlessly year after year. They live in dark, dilapidated, pigeon-coop-like wooden houses on the dirty street, perfectly content, without any other extravagant desires.</p>
<p>But I am always disgusted by its chaos and commotion, while they are all very accustomed to it. What is particularly annoying is that on sunny days, as you walk along, your neck is always brushed by dense bamboo poles, messily draped with newly washed, tattered clothing, including women’s shorts and children’s diapers, like an open-air art exhibition. Water drips down, possibly onto your neck, hair, or face, and you can only resent your bad luck:</p>
<p>A street without color!</p>

<p>Old Man Hu said, the Great War ended, and Germany and the other nations signed the Treaty of Versailles, but only eighteen years have passed. Now, the Great Mongol armies are once again advancing mightily, heading for the Rhine. The nations are alarmed and helpless. I think foreigners are really resourceful.</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Flandin said, "If even one German soldier is stationed on the Rhine, there can be no negotiations." The German government stated, "Withdrawing troops from the Rhine is absolutely out of the question." If the German army withdraws from the Rhine, France will lose face. It’s truly a case of an unmovable object hitting an irresistible force, somewhat awkward. Now, let's see how the English, as mediators, advise.</p>

<p>As soon as the second Beijing-Shanghai express train has left the station, his work is done. He leaves the ticket booth and enters the luggage room, signs his name on the register, and slips out like a gray, defeated mouse. He shivers, raises the collar of his coat to his neck, and awkwardly scratches his hair with his frozen fingers. He has no desire to linger around there. He takes a deep breath of cold air. He reaches out and wipes his dry, astringent mouth, which hasn’t had a bite to eat or a drop to drink from five in the morning until one twenty in the afternoon, and feels a bitter taste lingering. Originally,</p>

<p>— Written by Wan Chao Chen, Explained by Xin Xin</p>
<p>Mrs. Lindon: (Standing up) The bell rang outside. I’d better go.</p>
<p>Nora: No need, just sit. No one comes here. It must be for Tao Fo.</p>
<p>Ailan: (At the door) Madam, there is a guest who wants to see the master.</p>
<p>Nora: Who is the guest?</p>
<p>Korek: (At the door) Mrs. Hao, it’s me.</p>
<p>(Mrs. Lindon is startled and quickly hides by the window.)</p>
<p>Nora: (Approaching Korek, sounding anxious, and speaking softly) Is that you? What’s the matter? What do you want to talk to my husband about?</p>
<p>Korek: Well—it’s about the bank. I have a small position at the bank, and I heard your husband has become our new manager.</p>
<p>Nora: So you think—</p>
<p>Korek: Mrs. Hao, only for some unpleasant matters, nothing else.</p>
<p>Nora: Then please go sit in his study.</p>
<p>He had been suffering from headaches for several days, and he wasn’t eating as much as usual. He was mired in melancholy and had no interest in his work. Yet, he knew this was life. Occasionally, he remembered the hunger, poverty, and unease he experienced before getting this small job, and he felt content. But when he realized that he was taking the twenty yuan he earned each month home, he would often clench the bills tightly in his hand in despair, staring angrily at the darkening ceiling for a long time without saying a word. He was thinking that he couldn't provide his wife and children with a peaceful and happy life. Gradually, his vision filled with scattered, intangible black shadows.</p>
<p>It had been almost three months since he joined the railway. In this bleak season, his heart was chilled by the winter air. Windy days, snowy days, rainy days, his shadow, like a ghost, mournfully walked home from the station, and from home to the station. Sometimes, late at night, when he stepped out of the station and walked home on the desolate, silent streets, or passed through dark corners, one might suspect him of being a homeless vagrant. Even more often, when he finished his work and went home at 5:30 in the morning, his eyes were blurred, and everything he saw looked like a string of interwoven red and black numbers. He just walked forward with his head down, his head buried in his coat collar. When he reached the alley, he took out his key from his pocket, opened the door, climbed the stairs, unlocked his own door, and quietly, listlessly, jumped into bed. Within minutes, he was asleep, still and peaceful like a dead man.</p>
<p>Today, when he just stepped into his house, he saw the one-eyed landlady was nagging his wife about something. After he asked, he found out she was asking for the rent. He didn’t use a gentle tone, and started off unreasonably and rudely: “…Could it be that we can owe you? It’s only due today, and you’ve come up to ask…We’re moving tomorrow, moving…”</p>
<p>The landlady laughed awkwardly, said a few polite words, and left.</p>
<p>His wife was clearing the table to eat dinner and asked, “Isn’t today the day you get paid?”</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment, picked up the bowl of rice from the table, and said, “It’s already been given out, I didn’t receive it. I’ll go to the accounting office tomorrow…”</p>
<p>His wife didn’t ask him further. But he put the chopsticks down hard on the table, and said angrily, “This unlucky thing! I can only get fifteen big ones.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Lost it, miscalculated the accounts when checking the luggage tickets.”</p>
<p>His wife almost jumped up, and said with a sullen face: “Oh my, working for a month like crazy, and still losing money on such a small matter, what’s the point?”</p>
<p>How will we live this month? He thought silently, and gradually, gradually, his vision filled with scattered, intangible black shadows again.</p>

<p>Opening, "Woman Crying Over Agarwood," the autumn scene, osmanthus is fragrant in August. A passionate woman cries in her boudoir. Only hearing, the cold insects chirping outside the window. The wind blows the purple bamboo rustling. The iron horse under the eaves rings. Secretly lowers her head, thinking to herself. Thinking of the handsome and talented man from her mother's home. She married into her husband's family for less than half a month. The maid sent a letter to her room. Saying the talented man is ill in bed. She is like a incense altar, making an empty bow. Praying to the heavens and the city god. Wishing him peace and health. She married into her husband's family for less than a month. The maid sent a letter to her room. Saying the talented man's life is fleeting. Making her, cry to death several times before she is resurrected. Her husband asks her why she is sad. She only says her stomach aches, it is hard to bear. She should have offered condolences before his spirit. Only because she is a new bride less than a month married. Not attending the funeral in the hall. She can only secretly wear three points of mourning. Tying a piece of linen cloth to her chest. Not wearing red or green clothes. Only wearing two plain pieces of clothing. A pair of embroidered shoes with linen on them. Asking the maid to buy a piece of agarwood. She carves the talented man's handsome face. Carving him wearing a square scarf with double ribbons. White jade in the center shining. Wearing a dark blue gown with a light yellow belt. Red satin shoes with black satin trim. She has trouble carving you, pacing back and forth in the study. Difficult to carve you. Opening your mouth to call her younger sister. Difficult to carve you. Playing chess across from each other, watching "The West Chamber." Difficult to carve you. Urging several times, difficult to separate. Only because the bridal sedan chair arrives at the hall. She has to grit her teeth and say goodbye to the talented man. When turning around, she cries sadly. The idle people only talk idle talk. Only saying she is reluctant to leave her parents. How would they know. She is reluctant to part with a affectionate and righteous talented man. Talented man, she says you open your mouth for offerings on the dressing table. In the evening. Using the green gauze curtain as a shrine. There are so many sad things in the world. Others' sadness can be mourned. Her sadness is hidden in her stomach.</p>

<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin arrived in Shanghai and lingered in Nanshi, unable to tear himself away. After that, he saw "Burning Red Lotus Temple". According to his Shanghai impressions, he said: "Too excited." What is included in this "too excited"? It's better not to say. Saying it will make some people too "disappointed."</p>
<p>After Charlie Chaplin watched "Burning Red Lotus Temple," the communal stage used it as an advertisement. This can indeed be done, there is no need to discuss it. However, by analogy, our film "Burning Red Lotus Temple" can also be exported, with the advertisement saying: "The 'Burning Red Lotus Temple' that Charlie Chaplin enjoyed watching is now specially transported to be dedicated to Westerners." I wonder if our Grand Premier Zhang also has this intention?</p>
<p>(Confucius said: The shallow Wang Gong can be advised.)</p>
<p>Anna May Wong was rejected by the Taishan Compatriot Association in the four rural areas, so our "American star" had to leave Hong Kong in disappointment. Shanghai has given her gracious treatment, banquets and revelry, fearing that important people and celebrities would hear about it, I wonder what they would think?</p>
<p>(Confucius said: If you hear that you are invited to take a group photo, I wonder what you would think?)</p>
<p>According to Wu Han's news, the editor of "Twentieth Century" is going to be replaced. I hope this is a rumor. Otherwise, … Heavens!</p>
<p>(Confucius said: The history of March's season, the melancholic rain, the sighs of the six-stringed lute!)</p>
<p>In addition to "certain people often using pseudonyms to promote themselves and deceive the masses," there is a more wonderful method: asking friends to write (maybe using a pseudonym themselves) manuscripts such as "talent is not declining," and then asking celebrities to forward them to the other party's newspaper. In this way, "praise surges," and "talent" naturally "commercializes."</p>
