<h3>非常時期之教育</h3>
<p>— 乘</p>
<p>本月十七日入京會談之專科以上學校及中學校長百餘人發表簡要之宣言凡三事其第二項日「盡力實施切合國難時期需要之教育」十九日北平學生聯合會召開執委會議決五事其第四項日「各校開學時各同學一律複課但要求校方施行非常時期課程」是後值舊層歲除報紙循例停刊不知其他地方學生會有無相類之決議然就上舉兩事以觀足知施教者與受教者對於現行課程已有透切之認識共以為弦　從容緩不濟急當此最後關頭非實施特殊之教育即無異施教者與受教者獨貪逸豫退伍於爭求民族解放之陣綫是豈有血氣者所甘因而非常時期之教育遂為雙方所殷盼</p>
<p>夫我國之需要非常時期之教育固不自今日始自遠言之當廢除科舉創辦學校之初即宜有此遠識自近言之九一八之砲聲一二八之戰氛亦當促起覺悟發此大願乃歷來之教育舉棋不定仿此效彼學說之介紹紛如波斯炫　而教育之實際別為一事一言以蔽之無非變相之科舉而已至於最近觀於標舉之教育宗旨亦自冠冕堂皇然核實效則養成適用之技術人才解決個人之生計問題二項猶未能盡量做到　言應付非常時期爭求民族解放乎此皆舊賬無事細算請言今日今日者我全國大眾領受唯一之緊急課題即如何挽救危亡是今日而猶不實施非常時期之教育徒然　「讀書不忘救國」之陳言為「率由舊章」之教學則教育誠毫無意義之舉罷課固不是　復課亦奚足欣耶</p>
<p>非常時期教育之綱領近來頗有擬議者排比衆說斟酌損益求其至當而實施之一以滿足學生之望一以自盡報國之道此教育家之責任也既求而得之即當竭盡心力真切領受凡有所研究行動一以目前之緊急課題為中心務期其不落空虛確有實效此一般學生之責任也徒然之號召無所用虛名之標榜尤不可必也教育之本質確有變更所期之效率確有可計始得謂施教者與受教者真盡其責任</p>
<p>實施非常時期之教育自不須廢棄平時之學科與訓練平時之學科與訓練雖云有所為而實則殊無所為今悉令環拱於目前之緊急課題每一學科每一訓練皆成應對此課題之一節目乃為真有所為復因其為非常時期教育之故更必自平時之學科與訓練推而廣之如研究方面之國情探討國際局勢分析特種應用技術之修習訓練方面之生活體化意志堅強化皆平時所不甚措意而今則非特別注重不可者如是學生受教育並不單純「讀書」並非「預備生活」教師施教亦與金針度人有異蓋學生與教師共同為救亡而有所行動有所學習由行動而引起學習由學習而推進行動此聯合陣綫之說也亦教學做合一之說也</p>

<h3>故皇喬治第五小史</h3>
<p>英皇喬治第五、愛德華皇之决子、維多利亞女皇之孫也、一八六五年六月三日生於倫敦、年甫十二、與其兄克拉倫斯公爵同登練習艦不列坦尼亞號為海軍見習生、閱二年、昆仲奉命隨英艦隊之帆船巴强特號巡弋四海、所受待遇、與其他見習生同、歷經西印度羣島南菲洲澳洲日本中國埃及巴力斯坦各地、而以一八八二年八月返京、翌年供職海軍以勤奮從公、由海軍士官候補生歷陞至大尉職、年二十四、始獨當一面、任頭等魚雷艇管帶、閱二年、受封的克公爵、未幾攖重疾、甫愈、而其兄克拉倫公爵遽以短病棄世、於是喬治乃不得不脫離海軍現役、而担負儲君之更大責任、時為一八九二年一月也、</p>
<p>决年七月六日、喬治與曼麗郡主結褵、喬治年二十八、郡主年二十六、伉儷至篤、終身無違言、生子女六、長威爾斯親王愛德華、决的克公爵亞爾培、决宮生曼麗、决格洛塞斯特公爵亭利、决坎特公爵喬治、最幼者為的翰、於一九一九年一月病歿、年甫十四、</p>
<p>喬治登　後、曼麗后以質樸表率家庭、兼助良人處理國政、蓋后幼丞庭訓、長後好學、性情醇厚、識見遠大、而伉儷又同具愛民服勞之志、英民得斯國母、咸以為慶、而皇亦以得賢內助為其一生無上之幸福、一日有老友問皇、朝中輔弼孰最得力、皇不假思索而答、曰「余妻」皇對后愛情之摯、信任之堅、以此二字為表白、實勝千百言也、故英國歷史上皇之與后、在公共生活中密切聯合者、殆無過於喬治之與曼麗、二人之名將永永相述、長留於英民之紀念中矣、</p>
<p>一九零一年維多利亞女皇崩、喬治奉命偕其夫人曼麗巡綏帝國全部、時四子猶幼、長者僅七齡、幼者甫周歲、悉託付亞力山大后撫養、白登程至返國　閱八月、行四萬五千哩、歷十七屬地、旣歸、愛德華　嘉其　、授以威爾斯親土兼　斯德伯爵封號、</p>
<p>一九一零年五）月六日、愛德華皇晏駕、喬治乃登大位、翌晨、召集樞密院會議、向衆宣布曰、「遵循父規、保持憲政、將為朕一生最殷切之志云、　年六月二十一一日行加冕禮、舉國歡騰皇偕后巡幸杜白林曁蘇格蘭、受民衆極盛之歡迎、繼駕蒞印度、在德里受各王公與印民之至大敬禮、英皇遠適印度、此為創舉也、</p>
<p>一九一四年七月杪、歐洲戰雲瀰漫、皇關心綦切、嘗於晨二時自寢起、召首相考慮親懇俄帝中止動員事、但卒無效、至八月四日、英國朝野咸覺為保全國家生存計、不得不用干戈矣、後此四年、皇無日不處於憂患中、宵旰勤政、不遑稍休、開戰後三月、皇躬臨法國、勉屬國軍、巡視醫院、慰勞傷兵、時皇長子亦服役軍中、第二决巡閱西部陣綫、墜馬受傷、幸地軟無大礙、第三决至法、行近火綫、法軍砲火震撼天地、而皇泰然若自皇並巡閱泊於遠站之大艦隊、居國時頻頻偕后赴各地醫院、慰勞傷者、且至各軍火廠、鼓　工末年、皇與其后慶祝銀婚、偷敦市民獻金五萬三千鎊、以伸敬衷、而皇悉移與善舉、、</p>
<p>一九一八年十一月十一日、休戰協定簽字消息傳至倫敦、民衆歡喜若在、旋有數萬人集於白金漢宮外、歡呼「吾人欲面喬治皇」、皇乃引后出臨宮廊、向衆示感、當時景狀、實未前覩、一九一九年十月十日皇親筆署定和約、於是歷史上最大之戰爭乃告結束、全歐復覩昇平、</p>
<p>一九二一年、皇偕后適貝爾法斯行此愛爾蘭新成立之議會開幕禮、勸勉全愛人民當尊重和平、釋嫌相好、因是愛爾蘭恊定得吿成立、南愛另建自由邦政府、南北愛同趨自治之途徑、一九二三年皇遊意國、而憑弔陣亡將士塋地、英兵葬於是者、實繁有徒、皇不勝欷歔、諄諄以希望全世界勿再以戰爭為人類不可避免之負担為言、一九二八年休戰紀念日、皇以免冠立雨中致祭無名英雄墓、而感受風寒、旋成重恙、為勢頗危、綿延五月、至翌年四月中旬始驅車出遊、厥後雖數攖小極、而以醫治得法、迅吿痊愈、理玫行樂、行之金準備源源流出、英國預算案出入不能平動、於是皇覺時局阽危、不得不親問萬機、乃以八月二十一日由巴爾摩拉爾休憇中馳回倫敦、翌晨八時十分抵白金漢宮、忽進晨餐畢、即召首相麥唐納入宮、深談一小時許、繼文分別召見包爾溫與薩繆爾、垂詢一切、蓋欲先知各黨態度而從事平衡預算案、並應付其他財政困難萬至九月二十日內閣後因大局急迫、召集緊急會議、决議廢棄金本位、是時皇仍居巴爾摩拉爾、即於星期日午後在該處召集閣議、並署令授權皇家委員會代其核准新法制、翌日、廢棄金本位議案提出於國會、即經兩院於一决會議中三讀通過、而由皇家委員會核准、十月六日皇徇閣員之請、下令解散國會、總選舉之結果、麥唐納與國民政府獲大勝利焉、皇遇關係國家安危之大事、當機立斷、不稍遲疑、皇之一生展其主領全國之治才、厥以是年八至十月之時代為最、</p>
<p>一九三五年五月六日、為皇登極二五年紀念日、先數月、即作大規模之慶祝籌備、屆日全國各地至京參與盛典者數十萬人、是日全國休假、同仲慶祝、世界各國莫不發電致賀、皇對國民發廣播演說、遠東之中國日本亦能聞之、是年六月七日、國民政府改組、麥唐納辭揆席而以包爾溫為代、七月七日皇臨米爾登賀爾校閱空軍、芙皇校閱空軍在英國歷史上此為第一决、同日、空軍二十分隊飛過皇前、皇顧而樂之、閱七日臨魯煦摩爾校閱陸軍、步騎砲隊與坦克車隊參加之士兵都十四萬九千人、閱二日、復臨斯闢特海特校閱海軍、地中海艦隊內國艦隊後備艦隊參加此禮之大小軍艦都一首六十餘艘、皇乘御遊艇居艦隊者兩日、校閱既畢、皇導艦隊入海舉行大操、參加者都九十艦、繼於二十一日在海德公園校閱代表全國警隊之警士八千人、於是登極慶祝典禮乃告完畢、</p>

<p>皇深知一切行動、為國家憲法所限、故從不企圖微越共權、但同時對於其所負國家元首而亦為國家首僕之責任、未敢稍懈、皇自幼歷受應練、備悉甘苦、故一旦濟登大位、掌理萬機、乃能出於至誠而勝任愉快、皇之理政也、敏捷而合準繩、閣員從未有以皇决策遲延為怨者、皇每臨一事、夙夜　晝、絲毫不亂、凡今日能為之事决不延至明日、第一切　以閣員之意旨為依歸、從未自作主張也、</p>
<p>皇一生唯一之目鵠、厥為增進國民之幸福、皇謹守各界中之平和與善意、實為國利民福最要因素之原則、故皇念念不忘使帝國星羅棋布之各屬地密切團結而相親善、以為此乃共國民繁榮至穩固之希望、而亦即世界和平至穩固之保障也、</p>
<p>今者意阿戰爭進行方殷、歐洲各國多秣馬厲兵、以防巨變、而關係全世界和平之海軍會議復告破裂、前途吉凶未可逆料、乃此歐洲賢明之君、適於此時溘然長逝、不第可為英國扼腕、而亦可為全世界惋惜者也、所幸威雨斯親王方當年富力强、而又閱歷廣博、才識豐贍、一旦君臨全國、必能繼父志而光大之、此則可以預决者也、（路透電）</p>
<h3>日本議會開幕後卽解散　廣田宣布外交方針　調整對華關系仍以三原則為根據對俄擬要求撤東部西伯利亞軍隊　决定二月十日舉行選舉</h3>
<p>東京　廣田外相本日上午十一時在貴族院演說外交外針、其全文如决、關於日本外交問題、茲述最近經過、且開陳見、係余所以引為光榮者也、近時日本國際的地位、日愈提高、其責任亦愈加重大、然幸而日本欲貢獻於確保眞正世界和平之意圖、漸决澈底於世界、允其日本為東亞之安定專心努力之事、各國亦已認識、而至日本善鄰關係之確立、决第實現、不勝慶幸之至、日本盟邦「滿洲國」、年來進步發達、非且良可慶賀、且其與日本之關係、使加緊密狀態、因此、日本决定將在該國所有治外法權、漸决實行撤廢、並調整滿鐵附屬地之行政權、以期援助「滿洲國」之獨立發展、日本與「滿洲國」之緊密不可分離之關係、除有旣成立之共同防衛外、在經濟方面、應申兩國互相提携、於是遂見日滿經濟共同委員會之設立、此新興「滿洲國」之儼然存立與其健全發達、實為安定東亞之必要條件、吾人為達成此目的、應加努力、提高該國國際的地位、同時增進其與接攘諸國問之善鄰關係、換言之、在一方面調整中日滿三國關係、在他方面為最大努力、處理日滿俄三國關係也、</p>
<p>重述三原則　更觀中日滿三國關係、其關係雖决第改善、然未能謂之復歸常道、因此、吾人深覺更進一步、因此關係完全變為常態、以强固安定東亞之基礎、至為必要、於是日本政府經愼重審議之結果、樹立確定的對華方針矣、此方針以如决三項要旨而成、其第一點為關於中日兩國關係之根本的調整者中日兩國應積極恊力、以舉親善提携之實、中日兩國互相對立、不但於兩方不利、且由東亞大局上觀之、亦不能再忍之事也、然在中國、關於此點、如有充分覺醒、則日本為中國之發展、準備有形無形之援助固不待言、日本從來由上述大局的見地、隱忍自重，日本政府會於第六十七屆議闡明對鄰邦不威脅不侵略之很本政策、並努力利用機會、謀兩國國交復於常道、以期調整兩國利害關係之工作有進步、然截至今日為止、未見充分成果、實為遺憾、要中日關係完全復歸常道、應有使中滿關係進行正軌之必要、固不待論、中日滿三國各種利害、直接接觸之華北方面、其必要特別重大然因中國尙未承認與華北接續之「滿洲國」又因在北方長期間傳來之地方的特殊傳統、華北地方一時出現不安空氣、然述、不但調整中日直接關係、非於同時調整中日滿三國關係、難得東亞之安定、欲達成此目的者乃日本决定方針之第二點東亞之不安定、為赤化運動將可趁乘之機會、赤化運動之危險、雖不限於東亞地方、然其在東亞地方、共活動特別允甚、於是吾人為安定東亞及世界起見、防止在東亞之赤化運動、使中國脫離此危險、此不僅為中國之重耍問題、且係各國共通之重大事件、此卽今决决定方針之第三點、日本欲與中國為種種協力、以防止赤化之主旨卽是也、以上三點、為日本政府之確定方針、然其實、此並非新考案者、乃係達成安定東亞大目的之當然的基礎觀念、因此、其精神可稱為東亞各國共運方針、</p>
<p>日俄滿關係　其决、關於日滿俄三國關係、日本政府常向和平親善方面進行努力、而買收中東路交涉之成立、為排除多年跨於三國間之障得者、日本因為「滿洲國」負担共同防衛之義務、與「滿洲國」鄰接國家之政治及軍事上關係、自動的對日本致直接影饗、故日滿關係須要特別注意、「滿洲國」與蘇俄之間、有長距離之共通國境綫、因其間有國境不明瞭之地點、動輒發生紛爭、現在以解决此紛爭為目的、有設立混合委員會之說成為問題、然「滿洲國」政府主張先要劃定不明瞭之國境為必要也、唯在日滿俄三國關係中有不堪吾人關心者、為蘇俄在其邊境殖民地之東部西伯利亞、整備過大軍備是也、因此事直接對「滿洲國」民又對於日本國民於以多大刺戟、每有機會要求蘇俄當局考慮此點、（下略）（二十一日同盟電）</p>

<h3>農村生活叢談　杭縣凌家橋的土地關係及農業經營　續二十日</h3>
<p>— 郭人全</p>
<p>市區內許多大地主固然把大批土地分割得很零細地分租給本村各小農，本村有田三十畝以上的村戶，也都把一部分或大部分的田分租給本村各小農。本村農戶的耕種面積一般講來是很狹小的。有兩三家佃戶耕種農田達三十畝以上，但他們都是爲了人口多，勞動力有餘而逼得要如此的，他們並未大批雇用農工，絲毫未帶有資本主義的意味。普通農家（佃農）耕田都在十畝以下。</p>
<p>耕種技術無論在那一方面都表現得十分落後。非但打水機或較新式的打稻機及新式籬笆等，在本村從未看見過連運用耕牛戽水這件事，也屬寥寥無幾，而且還在逐年减少十去。此地稻田戽水一般都用人力，因爲河道很淺，只要二三人合起來，就可用一丈左右長的車槽從浦道裏汲上水來。合夥車水在其他各個運用人力車水的地方異常普遍，本地則連這點需要也沒有。</p>
<p>貧窮的結果迫使他們出賣了耕牛。車水雖可用人力代替，耕田（翻土）却非牛力不辦。所以每到國曆六月初頭預備翻土種稻時，專爲本地農民翻土的客牛便應時而來了。本村的有二千畝稻田，估計用客牛翻土的，的佔十分之七。這些客牛大都來自鄰縣蕭山富陽及諸暨等地，允以諸暨來的爲最多。他們有的是先在本鄉種定早稻再來，回去再種晚稻（富陽。諸暨）；有的先來本地耕田，耕定後再回去開始耕種自己的稻。每一頭牛有兩人跟了來，一個成人把犂耕田，一個牧童割草喂牛。耕田的犂也是他們自己帶的。他們來本村要住十天到二十天不等，各人年年借住在某些人家家褱，耕定田臨走時，普通是在借住的人家裏請一决菩薩，再出一元租金。每畝耕田的工資，在五年前是三角三分，近五年漲至四角五分，今年因穀價低落，又减至四角了。還有兩個人的飯食，是要主人供給的。本村運用客牛耕田，據說尚是最近十年內的事；從前多借用本村的牛，因爲那時農家對於茶樹的栽種不像現在這末重視，可以有較長的時間來種稻（從前四十天，現在縮至三十天），本村的耕牛在較長的時間內，逐家輸用，頗感足够，於是當地富有的農家遂養了牛來給人耕田，以圖微利。現在的情形已大不同了。</p>
<p>過去六七年內，茶的價錢很好，轉移了農民的視錢，都掉轉頭來努力開墾茶山去。種茶的全部勞動，除中耕施肥修剪外，嚴繁忙的是春季裏的摘「頭茶」。摘頭茶普通在榖雨節前，到這時節本地農家驟然需求很多的摘茶女工。因爲本村差不多每一家都種茶，無女工可雇，於是應時而起的，便從紹與，蕭山，諸暨，東陽等地，來了大批的摘茶女工，允以蕭山（的八十人）和東陽（的二十人）爲多。她們每年在差不多的時日，在兩三天中，都蜂擁似的趕來了。她們各有各的老東家，預先在前一年摘好茶以後的定了人數的多少，决年便準有多少人來。她們在本村的有四十天的逗留，住在東家，吃的是東家的飯。工資按伴計算，最近五年間，每摘一斤鮮葉便得一〇〇文，五年前則爲六〇——八〇文，十年前僅三十二文。這些女工正因爲是按伴計工資而另供飯食，於是她們的算計很好，每四五人中常有一位只會吃飯而摘不來茶的人，混在一起。這些女工的年齡以十餘歲至五十餘歲不等，摘得快的每天能摘五六斤，慢的三四斤。在四十天的時期內，每人平均的可掙得四元工資、帶着回家去。</p>
<p>如果茶市是長此以往極有前途的話，則茶樹的栽種大有向資本主義的道路發展的可能。本村有一位李姓的富農，在近五六年內每年曾化了二百元的租金，租進三十二畝茶地。僅僅摘茶女工的工資，要支付百六十元。製茶的短工二人，也要二十四元。</p>
<p>關於茶樹栽培及製茶的技術發展等等，作者以後再作詳細調查。</p>

<h3>世運籃球預選　今晚南京對華北　南京勝上海四七比卅六　上海勝華北五二比三十</h3>
<p>出席亞林比克全國得預選、於春節間在上海舉行、上海南京最先接觸、上海不幸以卅六比四十七敗北、第二幕上海對華北、客軍以三十比五十二受挫、各地籃球精萃、會集一地比賽、全運會外、此為第一次、以技術而定、實較全運會中、尤為精彩、今晚七時為南京對華北之戰、仍在申園舉行、是賽結束後、將從三隊中挑選混合隊、約上海錦標海賊及麥令斯作友誼比賽、今晚門券一元、裁判員張彼得呂葛馥、</p>
<p>南京克上海</p>
<p>京滬之戰、於廿三日晚七時在申園揭幕、南京隊有蜚聲遠東之名將王玉增、實力異常強勁、上海隊則以去年出席全運會者為基本、經一冬之練習、球藝亦進步不少、開始接觸、戒懼互嚴、久久不開紀錄、相持四分鐘時、李公瑜打開紀錄、上海由徐亨還中、南京王玉增再中後、上海從此後來居上、氣燄旺盛、南京極力抵抗、形勢緊張、滬隊常以一二分之差估先、上半時終了、則以十八比十七歸上海勝利、</p>
<p>易籃再戰、上海陣容略有更動、馮念華許文奎奮勇當先、左右逢源、連連得分、但南京不稍示弱、急起直追、王士先趙志華嚴加堵防、滬隊從此不能突破防綫、而王玉增鮑文沛屢建奇功、李公瑜奔搶敏捷、全隊合作佳妙、表演純熟、上海至此、不免相形見拙矣、結果四十七比三十六、勝利屬南京、</p>

<p>下半時起、上海從此一路順風、分數扶搖直上、反見華北心慌意亂、動作失常、運球進襲時、每遭王蔡之阻截、一籌莫展、結果華東以五二對三十大勝、是賽以孫寳慶與王南珍表演最佳、後孫以四次犯規罰出、易以蔡演雄、蔡王乃老搭擋、故益見錦上添花、暢所欲為、</p>

<p>埠際足球賽</p>
<h3>雨雪交加下　香港三比二勝上海　上半時一比一港隊攻守俱佳　冐雨雪作戰從來未有之奇觀</h3>
<p>一年一度之滬港埠際足球賽、於廢曆元旦（星期五）下午、雨雪交加這中、在逸園足球場舉行、此賽循例風雨無阻、故雙方健兒、均以大無畏之精神、冐雨雪而作戰、結果香港以三比二之成績、戰勝上海、保持「香港電聞杯」、是日雖雨雪交加、趨往逸園者、人數仍在五六千左右、北面看臺、後來者幾無立錐地、南面乙等看臺中、則僅佔三分之一、觀衆歡呼之熱烈、並不因天時之惡劣而稍形減色、全隊表演、港勝於滬、但上海前鋒、因射門之欠準、失落機會纍纍、尤為萬分可惜之事、否則出人意外之結果、並非不可能也、</p>
<p>靜默二分鐘</p>
<p>此次埠際足球賽、適値英皇逝世、本擬停止舉行、滬方特向港足球總會請示、旋得覆電、通知照常比賽、惟一切歡讌娛樂、均須停止、故昨日雙方健兒登場、均臂緾黑紗、帶孝應戰、開賽之前、雙方復列陣後、靜默兩分鐘、以示哀悼、原定念八日之埠際歡宴、臨時通吿取消、</p>
<p>港攻守咸佳</p>
<p>在此種雨雪交加之下、若非有眞實工夫、不克出塲參戰、以表演而論、港隊任何部份、俱較上海為佳、前鋒後衛、一氣貫穿、羅渣老將、救險不知其數、中衛綫之堅固、加以兩後衛、眞如銅牆鐵壁、滬隊屢攻不得志、即在此耳、前鋒在李惠堂領導之下、合作亦甚完美、尤以兩內鋒之活動為可怕、李惠堂在考司泰監視之下、較少活動、然鳥一出籠、險象即在眼前、雖在此種情形之下、其射門之妙、猶如在天時佳麗時也</p>
<p>滬缺欠合作</p>
<p>上海隊諸人、以柯拉沙最為努力、兩　亦十分拼命、惜乎力不從心、志與願違、因前鋒綫之缺少合作、徒然無濟於事、結果形成各個之作戰、不能常利用二翼、亦為大病、麥達最為減色、因此小吿山奴、遂得任意活動、下半時麥達傷出、陳鎭和落後、前鋒之攻力更薄、考雷兩人尙佳、李江二將、苦去大局、當爾勞苦功高、鮑賽促功罪參半、雖云救險不少、而球因接得而失落、致為敵中者、亦咎不容辭也、</p>
<p>球塲之景色</p>
<p>球塲之景象、可得而述者、開賽之前、球塲已一片是水、雙方在雨雪中稍加練習、開賽後、雨愈下愈密、球員此起彼仆、滿身泥漿、至下半時、雨化為雪、雪花紛飛、入後幾不能遠辨球在何處、甚至球員亦幾不可辨、雪積塲上、至少半寸、球在雪水中、浸得重加數斤、重而且滑、其苦可以想見、下半時、雙方球員俱各換衣、皮球亦重掉一隻、稍輕球員負擔也、</p>
<p>托　開紀錄</p>
<p>裁判陳吉祥勞苦功高、在雨下鳴笛開戰、上海隊開球、鮑塞列傳送福恩、黑炭越位而退、雷米迪推進、派路踢成角球、福恩未曾踢好、然上海隊之希望、殊為高大、如此者凡五分鐘、吿山奴沿邊直進、李惠堂攻門太輕、巴賽仲送出、巴路度接得、傳與托拔、直飛網角、巴接得而復為溜入、上海之龍門先陷、</p>
<p>造成一比一</p>
<p>海經此一失、傾全力反攻、前鋒五虎、圍逼香港球門、一時砲火連天、其勢殊烈、鮑塞列柯拉沙、連珠砲下、設非羅渣、港門早陷、一次羅渣拳擊脚踢、連救四次、球卒不進、凡三十分鐘、考司仄傳福恩、福恩傳中、霍威一脚低球、羅渣接得一滑、鮑塞列趕上一脚、造成和局、</p>
<p>接連進二隻</p>
<p>下半時雙方戰將易裝重行登場作戰、雨止而雪則大飛、接觸僅二分鐘、港隊全師進取、李惠堂盤過三關、一脚高球、擦過江善敬之頭頂而落入巴賽仲之手、巴又得而復失、遂成二比一、越七分鐘、港隊吿山奴沿邊進窺、李惠堂從旁恊助、盤過李寗、至安全地帶、由吿山奴從容命中、</p>
<p>二比三慘敗</p>
<p>上海以一比三屈麥達突在門前受傷出、上海以十人應戰、其情更苦、全隊出死力以圖挽救、一時竟猛攻甚烈、考司泰傳黑炭、黑炭越史溫而前進、一脚傳中、羅渣揮拳擊出、鮑塞列趕上一頂而中、麥達旋見歸伍、而上海隊一球之差、則始終不得救、</p>

<h3>三比一　中華敗於香港　積雪未乾場地濘滑　雙方表現稍形遜色　李惠堂射中二球</h3>
<p>香港足球隊於昨日下午三時、在申園足球場、與本埠中華隊作友誼比賽、因積雪未乾、場地濘滑、雙方表現、稍形遜色、觀衆六七千人、結果港以三比一勝、茲將戰情誌次、</p>
<p>上半時鏖戰成和局</p>
<p>港先開球、你嘶我殺、旗鼓相當、積水場滑、英雄時感無用武之地、不克展其所長港隊復施以遠射、均因球出軟弱、未能臻功、李國威在中華隊進攻聲中、一度受傷離場、未幾即入、但港氣不稍餒、小吿山奴門前一頂、予華隊以極大驚嚇、李義臣賈幼良先後射門、失諸不準、港環攻不已、殊佔優勝、托拔小吿山奴門下逞雄、危如卵石、危險萬分、幸內衛堅強、球王李惠堂復遭陳鎭祥嚴密監視、得免於難、黑炭陳鎭和、奔馳全場、頗著功績、然前鋒腳頭欠準、動作遲緩、中衛綫應接不靈、致雖有良機、亦等閒過去、上半時各無所獲、</p>
<p>李球王舉足開紀錄</p>
<p>休息後、易地再戰、中華隊轉展傳入、淸晰美觀、惜至最後關頭、賈幼良誤失戎機、中華隊一氣呵成、又至敵門、時氣燄甚熾、屢興大師、苦無射門腳頭、香港危機一過、又臨城下、球在門前兩過未入、亦云幸矣、港再攻球掠內衛、向門傍滾去、榮才未接、致成角球、不料竟鑄成大錯、碧福一腳、落點極佳、李惠堂得之在亂軍中、輕輕向門左角舉足送入、遂開紀錄、</p>
<p>陷三關奮戰復一城</p>
<p>中華隊最大之缺點、即在門前動作太緩、一度三鋒在港門前圍攻、羅渣臥地、但球仍為派路救出、惡運之來、接踵而至、江善敬踢球中梁樹棠身、復彈至李惠堂腳上、舉足一蹴、球向門之右角竄入、張榮才臥地仆救、已不及矣、遂失二球、再接再厲、小吿山奴一腳傳中、托拔趕上一腳、又陷三關、中華中路三鋒、收集殘兵、直撲內衛綫、果然福至心靈、李義臣一腳派司、孫錦順候得正好、趕上一腳應聲入網、雙方再經過七分鐘混戰、卽以三比一之結果、鳴金收兵、</p>

<h3>複本位制度與銀問題</h3>
<p>— 森禹</p>
<p>（一）提高銀價與複本位制度</p>
<p>銀在一般資本主義國家的貨幣范疇中被排除出來，除極少數經濟落後國家尙用作為幣材外，大致已不復視爲財富的對象，而形成與單純的普通商品無異。因之，銀之需要日見減退，價格下跌。復由於黃金需要的增加，金價上漲，銀價相對的益形低落，歐戰時，雖曾一度回漲，但究屬曇花一現，戰後依然下落。輓近世界經濟恐慌加深，跟着一般商口價格的跌落。銀價亦益跌。更因銀的生產技術發達及產量的增加，遠東南美各落後國家自無法盡行消納，於是銀價的降落便愈現愈烈，且遠過於普通物價下跌之程度。</p>
<p>銀價的下跌，實係資本主義世界矛盾發展中必然的結果，我們自然不能像俗流經濟學者倒果為因，把它當作世界經濟恐慌的主要因素：不過，它所反映出來的經濟恐慌之深刻，及它對於恐慌的反作用，倒亦爲無可吾認的事實</p>
<p>爲恢復銀價起見，許多人正在設法調劑銀的供求，　使銀的需要增加。他們認爲解决了銀問題，便可解决經濟恐慌。現時關於提高銀價的對策很多，包括起來，大致可以分作貨幣方面的出路和商品方面的出路兩類，列表如下：（參閱金原　之助著「世界貨幣制度上之若干問題」）售存銀；</p>
<p>從商品方面以圖回復銀價的方案，已由美國積極實施，如世界經濟會議中的銀恊定，以及歷决頒布的白銀法案等。但這種人爲的勉强的方法，終不免要產生畸形的結果，即使一時能够維持銀價於某種水凖，然而畢竟不能期望其長久持續，短期後仍有下跌之危險。因之，一般人認爲要根本救濟銀慌，必須另行向貨幣方面去尋求出路，而美國的白銀政策，在着眼於商品方面外，同時實亦復有貨幣方面的路綫</p>
<p>但上表貨幣方面之　擴大銀輔幣的形體及其使用，對於回復銀價的貢獻極少，似無補於事。　各國回復銀本位制度，在目前世界貨幣動態之下，顯然為事實上所不可能。最近比較被熱烈地所討論着的，係屬於（五）之金銀複本位制度，及由金銀複本位制度所發展出來的（六）金銀混合木位制度。至於（二）之金凖備中包含白銀，實亦近於金銀混合本位制度，（三）之在金本位制度下發行以銀爲準備的銀證券，近於金銀複本位制度。</p>
<p>（二）金銀複本位制度的內容</p>
<p>現在，讓我們來看看金銀複本位制度的內容如何？</p>
<p>金銀神筆本位制度（Bimelallism）和金銀平行本位制度（Barallel　Standard）及跛形本位制度（Limping　Standard）不同。在金銀平行本位制度之下，金銀幣兩者雖同樣得爲無限法貨，同機容許自由鑄造，但並不確立法定比價，人民在使用時，純依市價爲凖則。在跛形本位制度之下，金銀幣兩者也都被認爲無限法貨，且制定比價，然而却不許銀幣的自由鑄造。至於純粹金銀複木位制度，則必須具備下列四個主要條件：</p>
<p>法律規定金銀幣俱爲無限法貨；</p>
<p>允許金銀幣自由鑄造；</p>
<p>金銀幣間有一定的法定比價；</p>
<p>金銀輸出入自由。</p>
<p>但所謂法定比價常和市場上的實際比價發生差異，所以在余幣與銀幣之間，往往出現格萊雪姆法則（Gresham"s　Law）—惡幣驅逐良幣的法則。譬如金銀之法定比價爲一與十六，即金一盎斯等於銀十六盎斯，倘使現在市場上金銀的實際比價爲一與十五，則金賤銀貴，金爲惡幣，銀爲良幣：於是在支付時，多使用金幣—惡幣，銀幣—良幣將在市場絕跡，羣携赴造幣廠鎔鑄爲銀塊，或輸出國外圖利，或以銀易鑄金幣，結果，複本位制不免成了金單本位制。反之，若金貴銀賤，如現在的一與六十之比，則金爲良幣，銀爲惡幣，市場上將只見銀幣而不見金幣，成爲銀單本位制了。此種作用稱爲交替作用，所以複本位制度實類交替木位制度（Alternative　Standard）。</p>
<p>不過在另一方面，當銀貴金賤，一般人多使用低價的金幣時，金的需要大增，因而金價即趨回漲，而銀之相對的價格乃回跌；又在銀幣紛紛鎔鑄銀塊，銀塊供給量增多時，銀價必致回跌；而金價乃相對的回漲。結果，金銀之市場比價仍可回復到以前之平衡，而與法定比價相似。反之，當金貴銀賤之際，其情形亦正相同。此種作用謂之平準作用（EcuiiibratoryAction）或補償作用（Compensatory　Aetioin）爲複本位制度最重要的理論根據。</p>
<p>因着世界經濟情勢的推移，目下流通於市場上的，硬幣絕少，幾全係紙幣；金屬的本位貨幣實際上巳脫離了流通行程，金屬對國內純作保證手段，僅用於對外支付之際。所以，今後複本位制度已不能全與半世紀以前者絕對相同，其型式大致有下列二種：</p>
<p>第一，金銀俱作爲發行紙幣準備而集中於中央機關，對金發金紙幣，對銀發銀紙幣，金銀依據法定比價由中央機關貿賣，人民得持金紙幣兌金，銀紙幣兌銀。此種場合，僅係由金紙幣代金幣，銀紙幣代銀幣而使用，與以前複本位制度實質上無何多大分別。至格萊雪姆法則及交替作用與平準作用，則因須經過紙幣兌現階段，出現較爲遲緩。</p>
<p>第二，金銀亦同樣俱爲發行紙幣的準備而集中於中央機關，中央機關以一定價格買賣，但對於金凖備及銀準備所發行的紙幣，並不明白區別爲金紙幣或銀紙幣，紙幣兌現時，付金抑或付銀，中央機關有選擇權。此種場合，中央在金銀價格變動時，若仍能完全依照要求兌現者的願望，而支付金或銀，則情形與第一型式無甚差異，仍可由於補償作用，維持複本位制度的存續。然而倘使中央不理要求兌現者的願望，當銀價低落時，只允付銀而拒絕付金，則事實上金在貨幣意義中已被排斥，複本位制度便一變而爲銀的單本位制了。</p>
<p>複本位制度的效果究竟如何？</p>
<p>照目前複本位制度論者的見解，認爲採行複本位制度可有下列數種優點：</p>
<p>以銀補金的不足，俾挽救由於金不足而產生的物價下落及經濟蕭條。</p>
<p>通貨及信用數量旣以兩種金屬爲基礎，可使物價水準上昇。</p>
<p>由於平準作用可使物價趨於平衡。</p>
<p>銀之出路問題解決，銀價得以提高，因之由於銀價跌落所產生的經濟恐慌可克服。</p>
<p>銀價提高，用銀國允其是中國的購買力可增進。</p>
<p>複本位國與金本位及興銀木國之相互間匯兌行市可以安定。</p>
<p>現在，來分析這幾項的效果究竟如何？</p>
<p>先就第　項來說，資本主義經濟學者多盲目地或故意地掩蓋了現社會商品生產矛盾的諸種關係，抹煞了目前經濟恐慌的基本因素，因果倒置，反把恐慌責任大部分推卸於貨幣身上，他們有認爲現時物價下落，經濟簫條，係黃金不够應用所致。於是產生如卡薩爾（GustavCassel）等之「金不足論，」卡薩爾謂物價之所以下落，係缺乏金的供給之故。此種淪調實爲基於金的「物神崇拜性」的結果，他們完全忽略了金的恐慌乃資本主義經濟發展下生產不均衡之必然的現象。而且，在獨占資本主義時代，金的蓄積增大化，允屬無可避免的事實。複本位制度論者，認定以銀補金的不足，可挽救經濟蕭條，實係同樣中了金的「物神崇拜性」之迷。縱使白銀可能解决金不足的恐慌，然而跟着資本主義矛盾的再發展，結果還是要重臨危機的。</p>
<p>通貨及信用數量改以金銀爲基礎，可使物價水凖上昇一點，也未必盡然。倘若複本位制度實行後，金銀的法定比價和市塲比價相同，或相差極微，則在限前一與十六相比的情形之下，即使將銀生產的全部供作貨幣用途，貨幣之金屬素材之相對的增大額，與單以金爲基碰之時代，實覺所差無幾；因此對於物價上昇，便不能多大期待。假定金與銀的法定比價遠離市塲比價，而人爲地勉强大加提高，如一與十六之比，其刺激上昇，亦是有限，且爲非常動盪的。况格萊雪姆法則必劇烈地起作用，所謂良幣之金幣，勞將盡被惡幣之銀幣所驅逐，而卒成爲混亂的銀單本位制了。金凖備未具豐富的國家，金流出後，平準作用恐亦無由產生，回復面有平衡便不可能。結果，失去複本位商品無政府的大量生產，造成生產過剩；一方面大衆處於極度的被剝削地位，缺乏購買力。在此種畸形的矛盾狀態之下，試問物價焉得不跌？貨幣政策只是打嗎啡針，又貨得長使物價維繫而不再墜？</p>
<p>由於複本位制度之平凖作用，可使物價趨於平衡：這在理論上是對的，亦即複本位制度最主要之理論的根據。可是事實上却未必完全如此。物價之動邊，非純由貨幣政策所能安定，已如上述。况平凖作用須多數國家都採用複本位制度時才得順利，在當前經濟的國家主義盛行之時，國際間協調難期，採用複本位制度的領域未必廣汎。國際間旣乏相互間之調劑，因之平準作用自不得不橫受牽制。而如前述，金準備未具充分之國家，將僅止於格萊雪姆法則之累，而不易轉演其補償作用。又若金或銀的產量一時過多，到無法盡行吸收時，平準作用也無濟於事了。</p>
<p>所謂提高銀價，恢復繁榮，也並不這樣簡單。照眼前金銀的市場比價的一與六十言之，提高銀價似適與複本位制度相衝突；如前述，若金銀法定比價與市場比價相同或相差無幾，則銀價根本不見提高。倘使提高金銀法定比價爲一與十六，則銀生產必大增，藏銀亦將盡量傾出，銀價仍無以維持到底。復以格萊雪姆法則的關係，銀的惡幣驅逐金的良幣，如不同時繼起補償作用；即有化爲不自然的銀單本位之處。或銀價誠提高矣，苟其他一般商品價格未隨之同時上漲，繁榮依然無由。</p>
<p>銀價提高是吾可使用銀國允其是中國的購買力增進一節，已有過去事實爲之證明，似母待再行贅述。自美國積極的實施白銀政策以來，中國消納商品胃口不僅未見絲毫增進，抑且反因恐慌加劇而益形降退。銀價提高，在用銀國方面却相對的表現物價低落；此與促進物價之普遍的上昇之原來主旨，適得其反。</p>
<p>實行複本位制度的國家，其與金本位國及銀本位國之相互間滙兌行市，確可獲得相當安定，而相互間之貿易，亦可較爲順調。然而此非具有豐富的金準備和銀準備以調劑不可。像半殖民地的中國，根本談不到這一點。</p>
<p>綜上分析，可知複本位制度的效果决不能一如論者所想像的那麼完美，正有無可磨滅的許多缺點存在。</p>
<p>所謂金銀混合本位制度</p>
<p>現在尚有一種從純粹複本位制度發展出來的金銀混合本位制度（Symmetallism）；亦有稱之爲新複本位制度或科學的複本位制度。</p>
<p>這是英國新古典派經濟學者馬夏爾（Alfred　Marshall）所主張的，他認純粹的複本位制度尚不够穩定價值標準，應由金銀兩種金屬混合鑄成本位幣，以代替金銀兩者獨立的貨幣。或不鑄硬幣，發行紙幣使用，規定金銀二種的法定重量比率，一鎊紙幣本係含金一一三克冷（Grain,　I　grain　0.0648　gram）者，現在代以金五六·五克冷，及數倍或二十倍之銀（一·一三〇克冷），即依此種比率發行紙幣，紙幣兌現時，亦照此比率交付兩種金屬。所以在這種制度之下，一切的支付都不是一種金屬，而必須爲一定比率的兩種金屬了。馬夏爾論這種制度的特征約有下列幾點：</p>
<p>貨幣價值得依金及銀的平均價值而變動</p>
<p>可不致產生格萊雪姆法則，得免除惡幣驅逐良幣的現象；</p>
<p>可不致變形而爲交替本位制度或單本位制度；</p>
<p>可由一國自己單獨規定金銀比價而實行，不必如純粹複本位制度須獲得國際恊定；</p>
<p>如世界各國都能採行，即可完成通貨及物價之完全的國際的基礎。</p>
<p>然而，金銀混合本位制度果眞儘有這樣穩妥的作用嗎？照事實觀察，純粹複本位制度所包有的缺點，在大體上它也是避免不了的。就理論言，發行紙幣必須提供金銀兩物，兌現時亦係同樣付以金銀兩物，所以中央發券機關方面確無金或銀之一種，獨特發生恐慌的危險，而得保持凖備的平衡，這是對的。不過格萊雪姆法則仍可內在的醞釀着，如遇金或銀的市場價格發生激變時：就不得不遭遇困難了。倘使中央機關在必要時對金或銀之一種停止兌現，則這一制度便被破壞無餘。又國際恊調顯然困難，如果一國單獨樹立這種制度，則該國和其他金單木位國及銀單本位國的滙兌行市必致動盪無定，從而貿易與投資亦發生障碍：蓋因重量比率和市價不一致之故，以金或銀單獨測定該項貨幣價值時，不免常見動拖。</p>
<p>或謂金銀的合成可不用重量比率，而採行價值比率；例如其合成比率規定金之價值爲四分之三，銀四分之一，僅金的重量固定不變，銀的重量則並無一定，係依照銀對金的市價變動而增减，以保持其價値比率。然而這種方式的缺點尤多：</p>
<p>第一，金銀合成比率，如依照市場價格為標準，則其原來所期望的銀價以及一般物價的提高，便更難達到；</p>
<p>第二，合成比率旣以金銀市價變動而有增减，則該項貨幣勢必長處變幻之中：</p>
<p>第三，由於銀價的變動，發劵機關的銀準備價値必同時隨之變動，將有蒙受意外損失之虞。</p>
<p>美國與複本位制度</p>
<p>美國爲世界銀產的大主人翁，具自身居世界白銀生產的第二位；第一位的墨西哥，所有銀鑛資本中美國占十分之八；世界第四產銀國的加拿大，銀鑛資本十分之二屬於美國，計全世界白銀生產總量在美國資本支配之下者，達百分之六十以上。美國和白銀旣有這樣不可分離的密接關係，所以對於白銀價格的下跌，自然十分切心。除最近的白銀政策外，遠在十九世紀的下半，就已有提高白銀的法案了。</p>
<p>現時美國白銀政策的因素，雖有其國內的以及國際的根據，非常複雜；但準備實施金銀方法，所以它積極企圖把白銀恢復作爲貨幣用途。最近幾决銀法案中，複本位制度的活動己表現得非常明顯：一九三三年五月緊急農業救濟法第三部所謂湯姆斯修正條欵，曾規定援權總統得决定金銀比價，自由鑄造金銀貨幣，以及採用複本位制度之權；一九三四年三月戴士法案（dies'silver　Bill）中，復有增鑄銀幣的附加條欵；同年六月購銀法（The　silver　Purchase　act　of　1934）對於物品用金銀複本位制度問題，事實上已有更進一步的發展，計要點如下：</p>
<p>增加國庫的白銀凖備，達金七五銀二五，即金與銀的準備比率爲三對一；</p>
<p>授權財政部長得發行以銀為準備的銀票</p>
<p>美國除自身盡力使白銀在國內恢復其貨幣地位，俾形成金銀複本位制度外，同時並與各國亦商議炭復金銀複本位制度問題。</p>
<p>目前，美國對於複本位制度上益形活躍，不僅在其本國國內從事進行，且巳開始向外發展。美國把複本位制度一方面作為提高物價，恢復國內經濟繁榮的工具，一方面復企圖擴大到國際領域，要挾各國同時實行，而由彼控制之，藉以操縱國際金融。其最先的對象為墨西哥與加拿大；其决爲智利·秘魯·其他各拉丁美洲國家，以及中國埃及等；最後則擬威脅世界各主要國亦完全包羅之。其野心之深遠，實堪驚人。去年杪，墨西哥財政部長蘇萊士訪美時，聞美國又將與秘魯，加拿大等作同樣之討論，並有國際白銀會議的醞釀。此外，美國之進取中國，又始終不能忘懷，所以它切望中國幣制從速脫離英鎊關係，向複本位制度之路走。盛傳美國正擬以黃金易中國白銀，究非無因。</p>
<p>總之，美國之終極的目標，在於實行國際複本位制度；然而是吾有成功的希望呢？依照現實狀勢前途似乎還非常渺茫。若由恊調立，則根據過去歷史經騐，以及眼前國際鎊集團之對美抗戰，乃爲必然事實。縱言局部的複本位集團，例如包括美國·墨西哥。加拿大。其他中南各國以及中國等，恐亦未必能有理想中之順利。至於美國單獨一國或附加一二國，雖有相當可能性，可是困難點仍然有，實行後的成效也不一定絕對可靠。已擁有大量的金和銀，但究不能將全世盡行握之手中，倘便國際市場上金銀比無法單獨使其穩定不變，則複本位制度搖的危險，能吾維持到底，殊未敢必。</p>
<p>複本位制度與中國</p>
<p>最後不得不談到中國和複本位制度問題。</p>
<p>根據以上所述種種缺點與　碍，複本位制度對於中國，當然有同樣的許多困難點；且就黃金易中國白銀等；又中國內亦頗不乏贊同的人士，有的以為中國旣受白銀價格驟漲驟跌之禍害，應以金來作牽制，故實行複本位制度很宜，有的主張以複以複本位制度為過度，走向金木位之路。然而，這些都爲不顧審實之論，照個人意見，覺中國實行複本位制尚有特別應注意者數點：</p>
<p>金準備來源未必如想像之容易，縱使美國願意援助，但必爲附有相當條件的，或將損傷中國主權；</p>
<p>世界金銀市價完全握在他人手中，中國毫無過問之權，故法定比價絕難維持，勢將遭受金銀雙重變動的禍害；　在目下中國多一種通貨；徒然更增混亂，難獲圓滑流通；</p>
<p>如在他人操縱之下而成長，而實行，結果，仍陷附庸地位而已。</p>
<p>總之，現時中國實行複本位制度乃頗不易，抑亦不宜。</p>

<p>今年西曆是『一九三六』我爲這「一九三六』年測個字，算個命吧『一九三六』是『一救衰落』的變音！在剛過去的上一年，一切『衰落』的怪現象波及中國；商業的『衰落』，國勢的『衰落』已日趨共極了。</p>
<p>但在今年，只要我國同胞能一致努力復與，救國，那便能『一救衰落』了。</p>

<p>在那時，中國的『衰落』終止了！得救了……</p>
<h3>談雪</h3>
<p>— 逸梅</p>
<p>「仙人衣裳雲不染，天人顏色玉無瑕。」此崔德符詠雪之什也。雪之爲物，霏霏雰雰，洋洋灑灑，忽凝忽消，可茗可賞。洵極造物之能，盡化工之巧已。</p>
<p>幽夢影云：「樓上看山，城頭看雪。」蓋取其據高臨下，一覽無餘也。予謂若乘飛機，俯瞰下界，一白無垠，精光蕩射，覺此塵世，不復有些子齷齪，則更足快人意志也。</p>
<p>相傳有忌白者，遇大雪，卽閉戶不出，以其色也，抑何可笑。</p>
<p>昔鐵脚道人赤脚走雪中，嚼梅花滿口，和雪燕之。如此行逕，不必燒丹練汞，已足羽化登仙。</p>
<p>古人詩詞中，往往以瓊比雪，如裴乾餘云：「霽日雕　彩，」李商隱云：「己隨紅令誇瓊樹。」唐太宗云：「凝瓊遍雪華。」晏殊云：「一一瓊干十二樓。」張正見云：「雲夢起瓊田。」然困學紀聞云：「瓊爲赤玉，詠雪者不宜用之。」</p>
<p>頃檢一斑錄，載曩年之大雪云：「江浙　寒，遠遜北地，雪未有及尺者。道光十二年已云罕觀，乃去年辛丑冬，常昭雪至二尺，路斷行人，開而通之，略似金川維西之雪牆然。南路。湖州南潯等處允大，杭城更大雪及尋丈，市中開一丈，需錢三百五十文，房屋多遭坍壓，室中畫亦燃燈，出門莫辨方向，窮民凍餓死者甚多，從來所未經也。」較之此决美國喬治亞州與紐的州之雪災，街車全停，電燈電話被毀損，用掃雪夫役四萬五千人，剷雪機二千架，與雪暴相鬥，不相上下也。</p>
<p>予曾見任阜長所繪雪中送炭圖，人物古逸，躍然紙上。據云：「阜長作此圖時，天寒歲暮，困於窘鄕，有慨然惠以二十金者，阜長卽以此圖報之。」</p>
<p>蔬類中有雪裏蕻，雪天諸菜凍損，此菜獨靑，故名。醃以爲夢，滿飫肥甘後，略進少許，爽雋無與倫比，亦宴席不可或缺之物也。</p>
<h3>環境</h3>
<h3>寒窗淸供</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>案頭淸供，厥類甚多，而小小的石菖蒲，種於粉瓷白盆中，最足供人玩賞，允其值此嚴冬，置之硯旁筆架間，細碧如茵，悅目怡情，可稱獨一無二之佳品也；唯培養較難，倘不施以人工。任其天然生長，則無甚可取，僅資藥用與之輔佐品而已。</p>
<p>培植之法，先將菖蒲之根，從地中掘起，繼乃去葉，用缸盛河水過半，然後根於其內，歷數小時，如見水面浮有汽泡，連績發出，須將渾濁之水棄去，再換澄淸之水以調劑之，此爲最要。若至兩三日後，根旁露有生機，或見萌芽，則其秧已成，卽可加以手術矣。</p>
<p>其法用椶樹之皮，紮於極長之松葉兩端，特須先在鍋中煮之，因松葉中含有酸質多量，非經沸熱以排除之，不能適用；後將松葉聚成一束，的直徑二寸餘，以刀橫切之，分爲兩橛，乃將菖蒲之根，剪至半寸許，以决挿入松葉之中，愈細密，愈見佳妙，至無可再挿爲止；最後，復將稷皮裹於外，再用椶繩緊緊紮縛，仍投入水缸中，置於不見日光之處，墻隅苔砌之間，隨時注意其燥濕，速者一月之後，已靑葱可愛，吾亦兩月後，必成盆玩，殊可欣賞焉。</p>
<p>所謂棧紮萬蒲者，其實本非稷紮，不過相沿成爲一名詞耳：唯常列室中，缺乏空氣，亦非相宜，因植物亦需呼吸，久之，不免受窒息之害，故於夜間，務須移置庭院，俾沾露水，以潤其枯渴，非此其葉漸呈萎黃之色，而根亦必腐爛以盡，此不可不愼；此種栽植法，如在秋間爲之，現正可觀，目前行之，至廢歷歲朝，亦必靑靑可愛也。</p>

<h3>易君左的「半月」</h3>
<p>— （葛賢寗）</p>
<p>易君左是當代特出的詩人。他的詩篇早已膾炙人口，且有譜入音樂流佈於軍學兩界者。他不獨詩好，文亦雄健潑刺，挾有感人大力。　這個「半月」就是君左每半月所作詩文的總匯，現巳出至第十九期。它流佈了江蘇各縣，並且隨着時光之流，溢出蘇省，有傳佈全國之勢。一種刊物之盛行於一時代，絕非偶然的。從純文學的見地來講：「半月」上君左之詩文俱是爐火純靑之作，而爲一切文士所喜　所迷戀。從「半月」與社會之　用來講：它是有三種口號的：　接近民衆撫慰民衆而使民意日伸：　啟發激厲讀書人而使士氣日振；　歌咏英雄　揚先烈而使兵魂日强。</p>
<p>讀者諸君！民意，士氣，與兵魂三者，是不是目前中國所必需？君左，是最先盡其國民的犬職而有志於針砭國體之麻痺與癱瘓的，從這意義上，作者的精神是高貴的，激進的，熱烈的。</p>
<p>讀君左詩有如杜叟的沈吟天寶，陸游的悲憤興國，熱惰湃渀處，如讀拜倫大海弔希臘諸作，沉着雄健處，又可媲美　牙利愛國詩人彼得斐山陀爾·君左散文，近作以紀遊爲多，描畫江山之美，彌增人愛國愛家思想。語云「見景生情」，君左所見之景，皆中土最美之景，而所發之情亦皆國難重重中最沈痛最哀惋之情也，以最哀之情，融入最美之景，其文字之凄凉　遠處當可爲一切素心人所共欣賞。</p>
<p>筆者不揣冒昧，藉着拙劣的筆，來向國人介紹「半月」發行處：鎭江靑雲門續書樓易寓，代售處：全國各大書局，價格：每期銅元六枚全年廿叫期連郵叫角五分。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十三回　繞室發高談奮將起訴傾壺聯舊好利可忘嫌</p>
<p>只聽到那個操南方口音的人道：你不要妄想，火車就是再過三年，能不能通到西安，還是問題，你指望着目前，那是笑話了。這也難怪你們，你們全不看報，那裏知道外面的情形。修鐵路不是修汽車路，挖挖地就行了，這是鋪石子要鋪枕木和鋼軌的。由潼關到西安，還要上千萬工欵呢。觀音堂到潼關，不過是那一截路，總修了上十年，這才得通。現在車子到潼關，不過是一年，你想馬上就能够通到西安來嗎？現在收買西安地皮的人，都是押寶一樣，猜中就算中了，猜不中只好拉倒。像我們都是大公司，收買地皮，有得是錢，丟了就丟了，那毫不在乎。你不賣，我可要找別家了，整萬大洋錢，你可不要後悔。在這一套言語說過之後，那隔壁屋子裏，却是寂然。接着便是那個說南方話的人，連連咳嗽了兩聲。在這幾聲咳嗽之後，讓賈多才想起了一件事這個人姓金，是預備到西安咸陽打開包公司的，聽他這話音，必是騙本地的地主，來賣他的地皮，自己受銀行之托，也要在這兩個地方，買兩塊好地皮，而且也打算投資到打包公司去。現在這個姓金的，在上海方面，彼此狠有來往，他雖說是要到西北來辦實業，可是並沒有說什麼日子着手，不想他是偷倫的來了。這倒可以和他拉攏拉攏。索與把性子按捺下去，再在靠墻的椅子上坐着聽下去這就聽到那個本地人道人西安這塊地，是我一家人的，我倒沒有什麼爲難。咸陽那塊地皮，是好幾姓的地皮，我一家人作不了主，你若是再和我打折扣，我只好另找別個主顧了。姓金的道：旣是這樣說，我們先把西安這塊地皮生意作好了，咸陽的地，將來我們再商量。那本地人道：先生，你是個聰命人，還有什麼不明白的，我門就是為了等着錢用，才把這兩塊地同時出賣，假使可以以一塊地後賣，我門就索與等兩年了。無諭如何，兩年的利錢，總是等得出來的。（八九四）</p>

<h3>「那個」原來是手槍</h3>
<p>— 孫麟昌</p>
<p>「那個」這兩字，在近來的新聞紙上，　有發現，東也一個「那個」，西也一個『那個』。我們看了，眞不免有些「那個」。誰知最近無錫地方，有個中學生華永錫，因爲濫用「那個」，却闖了禍了。原來華、永錫近來因阮囊羞澀，寫了封信向朋友去告貸。中有這麼兩句：「如若不肯救弟一難，出門請你吃那個」。不料對方拏了道信去報告警局，因事涉恐嚇，就把華某拘來移解法院起訴，檢察官在他起訴書上，很肯定的說；「那個」當係指手槍，顯有嚇詐行爲，……這也可說是因文字而賈禍了。</p>

<h3>希特拉與麵包</h3>
<p>— 方殷</p>
<p>一月十三日爲德國收復薩爾一週年紀念，據哈瓦斯電云，是日該處曾有一度熟烈之慶祝，德意志陣綫廣塲（卽前市政廳廣塲）之前，並有國社黨退伍軍人一萬五千名，列隊遊行。隨後又在華德堡大廈，舉行盛大的集會，薩爾區域高級委員布克爾與德國內務部長費里克，均蒞會演說，布克爾的演說中，有謂「……吾人之在敎堂，先則誦讀『予吾人以麵包』之禱詞，繼乃禱告日：『願上帝爲吾人保存元首希特拉，庶幾吾人日常之麵包，母再爲人攘竊而去也。』……」此語殊堪耐人尋味，而允爲吾人觸目者，則唯布氏把麵包與希特拉，相提並論也。</p>
<p>自德國國社黨當政以後，我們始終未見希特拉實踐了他底『予吾人以麵包』的諾言，失業工人的數量固未見减少，且爲了取消失業救濟以擴充軍備的原故，反使一般失業者的生活更形惡劣。何况近來由於國社黨政府之加緊軍火工業的發展之故，使國內其它工業則大大落後，糧食的生產也大爲减縮，而另一方面也因爲軍火原料之輸入與食物之輸入相距太遠，至令目前國內大鬧食物恐慌。雖則在去年十一月間，德國經濟部長沙赫特，曾以「缺乏牛油」爲名，以證明其有「獲得新領十」之必要的妙論，但這只是帝國主義者侵略弱小民族和分割世界的一種藉口，於德國人民的本身，其實仍然是無補絲毫的。</p>
<p>近年來德國國社黨的專政，其暴厲的手叚，使一般人民只敢怒而不敢言。希特拉固未實踐其予人民以麵包的諾言，然而在街頭上，在廣塲中，卻到處都要人民高呼「聖希特拉」！「聖希特拉」一語，幾乎代替了一切口號和「早晨」「晚安」，不呼「聖希特拉」者，也常受嚴厲之處罰。今布克爾氏之演說又重提到要德國人民禱告：「願上帝爲吾人保存元首希特拉，庶幾吾人日常之麵包，母爲他人攘竊而去」，難道今日正在「保存元首希特拉」之時，德國人民的「日常之麵包」就「保存」得住了麼？何况有許多人旣未領有麵包，而又何從爲「他人攘竊而去」呢？……</p>
<h3>麥城的英靈</h3>
<p>— 林豪</p>
<p>十月的夜。</p>
<p>天是暗得怕人，沒有星也沒有月亮，天容是黑霧霧地帶些雨意；風在不息地吹着，呼呼呼的聲響又如虎吼，有時像大浪的撞在岩壁那樣的雄壯，有時却鳴咽地會使人起了痙　。森林裏的一帶枯椏殘枝，完全是光禿禿的沒一些敗葉零絮，給風一吹，搖呀搖的吟着一種非常古怪的不熟悉的聲音。城頭上還積着薄薄的銀霜，斑斑地亂雜着深褐色的足跡。挑在老高的桅桿上搖搖欲墮的掛着一盞燈，寫了一個「關」字，燐火般的閃着慘綠的，細微的光亮。下面不時可瞧得見幾個巡夜的兵丁，他們的臉黑得差不多像個鬼，眼皮漸漸地將合下來了，便提起了力，用勁把眼珠勉强地撑開來，惺忪地瞧瞧同伴，瞧瞧遠處敵人的營帳，誰都顯露着衰疲與沉鬱的模樣；偶然在角隅裏飄來了幾陣眠鼾，很饗。</p>
<p>「媽的，這懶牛！」嘴裏說着，心裏也就有些冤透：（敵入扣住了要道，糧食又斷了幾天，兵將傷死了大半，白天也得躭着心，黑夜裏這麼地受苦，不是關將軍的賢良，哼！老實說，誰也管不了許多，各走他媽的路了）。風吹來了的削骨似冷，肚子裏又空隆空隆地呌起來，沒法兒，緊了緊褲帶。混身打着抖，上牙得得得地碰着下牙，模了摸刀柄：「他媽的，殺出去算啦！殺光這些囚囊的就完事啦」！可是，想一想咱們的人，咱們的肚皮……沸騰的血頓時冷得像泳，咬了咬牙，重又疲勞地在城頭上　着來去。心，愁得像有千萬條的絲緾着一樣的煩。</p>
<p>見了他們這一個個尖瘦的蒼白色的臉底時候，就知道他們己有若干天沒有好吃了；眞的，他們已是斷了幾天的糧，廖將軍到上庸求救都沒回音，過幾時不戰死也得餓死了。因此，有好多個都越城投降去了。關將軍也沒法見，每天祇是張着丹鳳眼駡孫權：「媽的，這碧眼賊」！</p>
<p>城頭，祇是死洋洋的一片，搖着幾個疲透了的腦袋，間或幌着三數盞手提燈籠的微光，在幽幽地跳着垂危的燈蕊；風，不斷地吹着，吹着。</p>
<p>遠遠的，像踱來了一叢人，在那兒燈籠光的閃爍裏，可以瞧得見一個爛熟的臉，那個，就是「關雲長」，關將軍。一個瘦長臉的兵丁首先發現了：</p>
<p>「喂！關將軍來啦」！</p>
<p>「喂！這懶猪，關將軍來啦」！有的便把脚踢踢靠在牆角打盹的同伴們。</p>
<p>「怎麼！關將軍」？夢鄕裏驚醒過來，打了個呵欠，揉揉眼皮，沒頭沒腦地跳了起來：「呀！的是拿犒勞酒來的吧」</p>
<p>「呸！你想嗎。哼！做夢呢，這懶猪」！瘦長的冷笑一下：「快起來走走吧！」</p>
<p>「……」垂着腦袋，和幾個同伴迎了過去：</p>
<p>「迎見關將軍」。將軍和善地拂了拂手，和着同來了趙累，王甫，周倉，關平等幾個，巡着城向外望：「你們瞧，北門外的敵人看來還少，咱們準定還是打那兒殺出去吧」？</p>
<p>「是」。異口同聲地回答一下。</p>
<p>四週是黑憧憧的，頭項上時時掠過了蝙蝠，或是陰悽的九頭烏，貓頭鷹，斷續的嗚聲連人的腸子也幾乎給呌得迸斷了。將軍默默地沉着半嚮，抬起了頭，開始一番悲哀的，歉意的祈禱：（並不是關某的膽寒而丟掉了麥城，也不是關某的怕死而走西川，實在的話，關某是想重整旗鼓地來决一死戰。老天哪！你能佑我平安地到達西川吧）！</p>
<p>於是，雲長帶了二百多個殘卒，關平，趙累等突出北門，城中祇留周會王甫二個以及部卒百餘人。臨別，王甫悽然地哭泣着：</p>
<p>「我們是死據着這城的。雖然城破，我們也不會負了將軍而降，我們希望的是將軍快來救援呵！珍重吧！將軍。」</p>
<p>二十餘里的過程過去了。是一個山凹裏，驀地裏幌出了幾百盞明亮的燈，鼓聲不斷地震着耳膜，人，像翻山那樣地殺過來。</p>
<p>「殺呀！」</p>
<p>「殺呀！」</p>
<p>掀起了心的怒潮，火般的狂燒，白的刀，亮的鎗，閃爍的劍鋒，一幌幌的戈芒，鐵的力，紅的血，熱的氣氛，怒張的凶眼，倒豎的濃眉，光閃閃的鎧甲……在黑暗的山凹裏，在點得像白畫一樣的燈籠的下邊，幾百幾千個壯男，虎也似的撲斬，喊聲在山谷中回饗過來，更見得響了。血像黃河的水，在緊縮的脖子空裏轟然地湧了出來，射得半天高，馬，嘩啦嘩啦地悲啼着，鈴聲不斷地可噹可噹地在彼此死拼的交響中淸澈地震進人的耳鼓，天，也像給這狂大的嘈雜聲喊開了般的亮起來了。</p>
<p>手砍斷了，脚斬去了，腦袋平空地飛去……；在這時候，是算不了一會事的，更設不到驚奇。</p>
<p>雲長揮着刀，眼見敵人的兵愈來愈多了。半響，趙累的腦袋　地在雪亮的刀一揮之下墜在亂軍中了·心，像給千萬把刀刺着那樣的痛，惘然地和關平倆奮着力地殺，瞧瞧兵，却又殺得個一乾二凈，但也有些是投降了。</p>
<p>終於，在敵人的擊攻之下不支被擒了。</p>
<p>敵人，都顯着勝利的微笑，像是在說：「蓋世的關雲長也都給咱們抓住啦，」的那樣高傲。遠遠的，却又飄來疏落的幾陣垂死的傷兵的號歎！</p>
<h3>故鄉的花訊</h3>
<p>— 華穆</p>
<p>依照廢曆推算，現在可正是臘殘春始的節候，在南方嶺表之地的故鄉，已是東風飄忽，隨地溢揚起新春的戚覺了。江南的春來到底遲了些時。北地當然又更遼遠的。冰風獵獵的草原林樹之間，幾曾嗅得到些微新春的氣息。花店裏雖然儘有鮮紅艷紫的盆花擺着，原係人工開出來的，與自然節令仍屬無關；蹤使站到花房邊，對眼前的紫紅艷綠，於春的感覺仍很淡漠；冰雪飛積的郊野間，固然有梅可賞可摘，無如從來習見又是看作仍與春天無關的，都是因雪纔想到梅，梅的聲價也常賴雪而增高博得人們的愛好。我初來上海那年，是在廢曆新年元宵後，離家時屋背園中的桃李早經開花過了，心想，上海雖說此故鄉冷，這時總當暖和了的，而結果是坐在黃</p>

<h3>Hebei-Chahar Problem: Negotiations Appear Dim, Disagreement Wide, Actual Talks Stalled, Chen Zhongfu Visits Doihara Yesterday to Consult with Song</h3>
<p>Tianjin: Authentic sources say that the Hebei-East Hebei negotiations still face many difficulties. Due to vast differences in opinion on both sides, the actual negotiations have been stalled since before the Spring Festival. A certain party is using the puppet East Hebei organization as a tool to contain the activities of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. The majority of staff at the North China Garrison Headquarters oppose abolishing the East Hebei government and oppose the Hebei-Chahar authorities negotiating directly with a certain influential figure in Shenyang. This influential figure wants to create another situation in North China and is also finding ways to avoid negotiating the East Hebei incident. The key now lies in whether a certain country's hoped-for new situation in North China can be realized. If it is realized, then the East Hebei puppet organization will be eliminated by that country without any negotiation, and we will only waste our breath, making it difficult to achieve success. The future of the situation still appears dim. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Athletics: Doihara returned to Tianjin by plane on the 24th after meeting with Yan Xishan in Taiyuan. Negotiations on the East Hebei issue have been suspended for several days due to the Spring Festival, with all parties busy with social engagements. Chen Zhongfu, a member of the Diplomatic Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, went to the Changpan Hotel at 2:00 PM on the 26th to visit Doihara and consult with him on behalf of Song Zheyuan. Xiao Zhenying went to Ping to visit relatives before the Spring Festival and returned to Tianjin at noon on the 26th with Shi Jingting of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, Wang Shijiu, the Secretary-General of the Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters, and others. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Song Zheyuan went to Tianjin on the 14th to discuss issues such as East Hebei with the Japanese side. It is heard that Doihara, the representative of the Japanese Kwantung Army, will go to Jinan to meet with Han in the next few days. A solution to this matter has been discussed for several days, and the details still need to be considered at length. Negotiations on the Chahar North issue will begin after the East Hebei matter is resolved. Xiao Zhenying, the Mayor of Tianjin, Shi Jingting, the Chief Advisor to the Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters, Wang Shijiu, the Secretary-General of the Pacification Headquarters, and Zhang Weifan, the Director of the Ping-Sui Railway Bureau, went to Tianjin in the same car this morning. Xiao said that the negotiation of the East Hebei issue would continue after he returned to Tianjin. Tianjin: Exempting eight miscellaneous taxes can reduce the burden on the people by more than 300,000 yuan. After Lei Jihe was assassinated, orders were issued to intensify the search for the murderers. He himself came to Ping for the Spring Festival and is now returning to Tianjin because of official duties at the municipal government. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Hebei-Chahar diplomatic negotiations have recently been temporarily suspended. Although Chen Zhongfu, Chen Juesheng, and others in Tianjin are still in constant contact with the Japanese side, it is only in the nature of private social engagements. It is heard that the reason for the suspension is not an unexpected breakdown, but that some of the minor issues are quite difficult to study. At the same time, it is the Spring Festival, and Xiao Zhenying and others came to Ping for business, so it is generally speculated that Song Zheyuan may move the negotiations to Ping after he comes to Ping. According to official sources, the future is not pessimistic, but the length of time is uncertain. (25th Central News Agency Electric Wire)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Starting this month, the Changlu Salt Tax will provide 250,000 yuan in assistance to the puppet East Hebei government. This will be allocated by the Changlu Salt Transport Office. The Bei-Ning Railway Bureau will also allocate 100,000 yuan to the puppet organization as construction funds starting this month. The puppet East Hebei government will use these two sums as the entire district's administrative expenses. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Jinan: A Tianjin newspaper reported that Doihara came to Jinan to meet with Han, but after investigation, this is not accurate. (24th Central News Agency Electric Wire) other tasks. (24th Central News Agency Electric Wire)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The Bei-Ning Railway Bureau has agreed with the Japanese side that in order to crack down on unlicensed rides by Japanese and Korean vagrants and to investigate and prohibit the smuggling of untaxed Japanese goods, starting next week, each train between Ping and Yu will have one Japanese military police officer escorting the train. The railway bureau has issued a notice to all stations to comply, but is not responsible for any Chinese passengers. (26th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Arima to Go to Nanjing Tomorrow, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Denies Agreeing to Japanese Three Principles</h3>
<p>Nanjing: Arima is scheduled to take the night train to Nanjing on the 28th and has requested appointments with Foreign Minister Zhang and Premier Jiang. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Arima is coming to Nanjing to bid farewell, and Foreign Minister Zhang is scheduled to host a farewell banquet on the evening of the 29th. Premier Jiang is scheduled to host a luncheon banquet on the 30th. Arita, the newly appointed ambassador, has been officially telegraphed by the Japanese Foreign Ministry to our government on the 24th to seek agreement and is scheduled to be submitted to the Central Political Council on the 29th. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: A Reuters dispatch stated that Foreign Minister Hirota's Three Principles said that China had already expressed its approval. One point also included the intention to recognize Manchukuo. The reporter found that the three points mentioned by various newspapers varied greatly, so he visited a Foreign Ministry spokesman to inquire about the truth. According to the spokesman, the so-called Three Principles of Hirota towards China refer to the three points proposed by Foreign Minister Hirota to our Ambassador Jiang in mid-September last year. Although we recognize the relationship between China and Japan, we have tried our best to resolve disputes that have occurred repeatedly in recent years, but there has been an endless stream of incidents. Therefore, our government proposed basic measures to improve Sino-Japanese relations to the Japanese government last year. Foreign Minister Hirota then expressed to former Ambassador Jiang that the measures proposed by China were, in principle, not unfeasible, but China must first agree to three points: First, China must absolutely abandon the policy of using barbarians to control barbarians; second, China must respect the existence of the "Manchukuo" reality; third, China and Japan must jointly discuss effective ways to prevent the spread of communism in the northern part of China. Our side felt that the wording of these three points was too vague to be discussed, so we asked the Japanese side to present its specific content. The Japanese side has not yet presented it, and Foreign Minister Hirota's speech that China has already agreed is not true. Recently, after Minister Zhang took office, he proposed that China and Japan must conduct negotiations through diplomatic channels in a normal manner, so that the relations between the two countries can be fundamentally adjusted. Now, Foreign Minister Hirota expressed his approval of this proposal in his parliamentary speech and reiterated the fundamental policy of not threatening or invading neighboring countries, striving to normalize the relations between the two countries and adjusting the interests of the two countries. This is no different from our position. If we continue to negotiate along this path in the future, the relations between the two countries can be improved.

After the incident of a police officer from the Japanese Consulate being shot to death, another Japanese cruiser arrived at the port. It is now known that the port is still peaceful. Local officials are currently trying to resolve the case locally, so it has not yet been transferred to the provincial government for handling.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Education in Extraordinary Times</h3>
<p>— By 乘</p>
<p>Over a hundred presidents of specialized schools, universities, and secondary schools who gathered in Beijing for talks on the 17th of this month issued a brief declaration with three points. The second point was: "Exert efforts to implement education that meets the needs of this time of national crisis." On the 19th, the Peiping (Beijing) Student Union convened an executive committee meeting and resolved five points, with the fourth being: "When schools reopen, all students should return to classes, but they request the schools to implement a curriculum for this extraordinary period." Afterwards, it was near the end of the old year, and newspapers were closed for the holidays as usual. It is unknown whether student unions in other places made similar resolutions. However, based on the two incidents mentioned above, it is clear that both educators and those being educated have a thorough understanding of the current curriculum. They both believe that playing stringed instruments at a leisurely pace is not effective in addressing the urgent needs. At this final critical juncture, if we do not implement special education, it would be no different from educators and those being educated indulging in ease and retreating from the front line of the struggle for national liberation. How can any spirited person be willing to do this? Therefore, education for this extraordinary period is eagerly anticipated by both parties.</p>
<p>In fact, the need for extraordinary education in our country did not begin today. From a long-term perspective, we should have had this foresight from the very beginning when we abolished the imperial examination system and established schools. From a recent perspective, the sound of gunfire on September 18th (Mukden Incident) and the atmosphere of war on January 28th (Shanghai Incident) should have also prompted awareness and inspired this great aspiration. However, education throughout has been indecisive, imitating this and following that. The introduction of theories is as numerous as Persian carpets, while the reality of education is a separate matter. In short, it is nothing more than a transformed version of the imperial examination. As for the recently proclaimed educational goals, they are also grand and impressive. However, in reality, even the two goals of cultivating practical technical talents and solving personal livelihood problems have not been fully achieved. What about responding to extraordinary times and striving for national liberation? These are all old debts that need not be meticulously calculated. Let us talk about today. Today, the only urgent issue that the masses of our entire country are facing is how to save the nation from peril. If we still do not implement education for this extraordinary period today, and only chant empty slogans such as "Studying without forgetting to save the country" and "Following old practices" in teaching, then education is truly a meaningless endeavor. Going on strike is certainly not right, but returning to class is also not something to celebrate.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been many proposals for the guidelines of education in this extraordinary period. By comparing various views, carefully considering gains and losses, and seeking the most appropriate approach, we can satisfy the students' expectations and fulfill the duty of serving the country. This is the responsibility of educators. Once a solution is found, we should devote all our efforts to sincerely understand it. All research and actions should focus on the urgent issues at hand, ensuring that they are not empty and have practical effects. This is the responsibility of the general student body. Empty slogans are useless, and emphasizing superficial fame is especially undesirable. Only when the essence of education is truly changed and the expected efficiency is truly calculable can it be said that both educators and those being educated have truly fulfilled their responsibilities.</p>
<p>Implementing education for this extraordinary period does not mean abandoning regular subjects and training. Regular subjects and training, while claimed to be purposeful, are actually largely without purpose. Now, let us surround them around the current urgent issues, so that each subject and each training becomes a program to address these issues. This is truly purposeful. Furthermore, because it is education for this extraordinary period, we must expand upon regular subjects and training. For example, in the realm of research, we should study national conditions, explore the international situation, and analyze specialized application technologies. In the realm of training, we should cultivate a practical lifestyle, strengthen will, and enhance physical fitness. These are aspects that were not given much attention in ordinary times, but now they must be specially emphasized. In this way, students' education is not simply "reading books" and not "preparing for life." Teachers' teaching is also different from simply imparting knowledge. Students and teachers work together to save the nation through action and learning. Action leads to learning, and learning promotes action. This is the idea of a united front, and it is also the idea of integrating teaching, learning, and doing.</p>

(Reuters dispatch on the 22nd) New Monarch Edward VIII.</p>
<h3>Both Houses Pass Resolutions of Condolence to New King and Queen Mother</h3>
<p>London: Today, both houses of Parliament passed resolutions of condolence to the new King and Queen Mother. When the House of Commons reconvened, the speaker and all officials were in formal attire, and all members were in heavy mourning. Prime Minister Baldwin stood at the head of the house and announced the receipt of the decree signed by the new King, which he then handed to the speaker to read to the house. It said that the late king had served the people throughout his life and upheld the constitution. He was determined to follow the late king's legacy to fulfill his responsibilities. Baldwin then read a motion from the House of Commons expressing condolences to the new King, expressing its deep gratitude for the merits of the late King, and expressing its deep belief that the new King's reign would consistently promote the welfare of the people and protect the freedom of the people. He also read a motion from the House of Commons expressing condolences to the Queen Mother. When the Prime Minister spoke in support of the two motions, he mentioned that the new King would be crowned in Westminster Abbey next year, because that church was the first meeting place of Parliament. Then, he praised the late King's merits in eulogizing the constitution and his sincere love for his subjects. After the Prime Minister's speech, Labor leader Attlee and Liberal leader Sinclair spoke in support. The two texts were then passed unanimously. The House of Lords also passed the same two texts. Before the passage, the Archbishop of Canterbury spoke, saying that on the day of his death, the late King struggled to get up to sign the decree to organize the regency, but he could not support himself. He gave everyone a final smile, which showed that the late King was still loyal to his responsibilities at the moment of his death. Reuters later learned that the late King had indeed made a symbol on the final decree, but it could not be recognized as his signature. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Baldwin Gives Radio Address, Late King Still Concerned About National Affairs on His Deathbed, New King Is Wise and Will Live Up to Expectations</h3>
<p>London: British Prime Minister Baldwin gave a radio address last night, announcing to the nation that the King was conscious several times on his deathbed. On one occasion, he summoned his secretary, Wigram, and asked, "How is the Empire?" Wigram replied, "Your Majesty, please rest assured, everything is fine with the Empire." The King smiled, and then fell back into a coma. This shows that even when the King was critically ill, he was still concerned about national affairs. There is no one in the Empire who is not saddened by this bad news, and this is not only the case in the United Kingdom. The King has been in power for 25 years and has never had a moment of leisure. The world has been in a state of chaos during this period, and there has never been a moment when the King could think that the world situation was peaceful. The King worked tirelessly every day, and his physical strength has been depleted. Therefore, the disease was able to invade. The King lived in a high position and worked tirelessly day and night. Now he is exhausted and his soul has returned to heaven. How can we, the people of our country, comfort the late king and commemorate him? The only best way is to unanimously support the new king. The new king has inherited his father's position and will be able to shoulder heavy responsibilities. The new king has been taught since childhood, and his life's deeds are known to the Empire. He is now at the peak of his youth and strength, and his future prospects are limitless. The new king knows the earnest expectations of hundreds of millions of people, and he knows that he has the loyalty of the people of the whole country. He will live up to the expectations of the people. May God bless him. (Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>A Brief History of the New King of England, Edward</h3>
<p>When the new King of England, Edward VIII, was the Crown Prince, he was one of the most gentle and beloved nobles in the world. The Crown Prince is rich in emotion. Not only is he respected and loved by the people of his own country, but he is also welcomed wherever he goes in other countries. This is something that previous Crown Princes have never had. The reason why he can do this is nothing special. It is just that he can treat people with sincerity and treat everyone equally. He never prides himself on being the Crown Prince, so people are happy to associate with him, and he is loved by all classes and races. In addition to being taught since childhood, which has become a habit, it has also played a powerful role.</p>
<p>The Crown Prince has been sent to visit countries all over the world. At the beginning of the European War, he was an adult. His service and enjoyment can be a model for the men of the Empire. He always seeks to complete everything he does. He always helps those who are not as fortunate as himself. The Crown Prince is very familiar with the people at home and abroad, which no previous Crown Prince could have achieved. In his country, he associates with politicians, generals and soldiers, nobles and commoners, and even workers in factories. The Crown Prince is concerned about national affairs, large and small. Whenever a problem arises in the country, he studies it carefully, so he can always give advice when it is solved.</p>
<p>The Crown Prince was born on June 23, 1894, in the White Lodge in Richmond. His early life was much the same as that of children in good British families. He often lived in Sandringham and played football with his younger brother, the Duke of York, and the village children. His education was no different from that of ordinary children in the country. At the age of eight, he was taught by Mr. Hansell, and he only separated from him when the European War broke out. In May 1907, he passed the entrance examination for Osborne Naval College and became a naval cadet. After two years, he was promoted to Dartmouth Naval College, where he studied for two more years. He served as a naval officer candidate and boarded the cruiser Hindustan for three months of maritime training. At this time, he had already become the heir to the throne. After the death of Edward VII, he was created Duke of Cornwall. On his sixteenth birthday in 1910, he was created Prince of Wales. In the spring of 1912, he began to work in the navy. Soon, he went to Paris with his teacher, Mr. Hansell, and stayed at the home of the Marquis de Breteuil to study local customs. Because his grandfather had concluded a treaty of friendship with France, the friendly relations between Britain and France became closer. For the sake of knowing each other and knowing ourselves, this trip was made. After returning, he entered Oxford University. This move was of great significance to his life, because he was able to meet the talented young people in the country and learn about their ambitions and character. He also unconsciously absorbed many new trends, which changed his behavior in later years. After school, he often participated in various ball clubs, listened to lectures, and read constitutional law with Sir Anson. He also wrote from time to time. During the holidays in 1913, he went to Germany as a guest of Emperor Wilhelm. In 1914, he continued to study at Oxford. He initially planned to stay for another semester, but then the assassination of Sarajevo occurred, and he and hundreds of millions of people in Europe completely changed their lives.</p>
<p>When he lived in Oxford, he was listed in the officer training corps and served diligently. He was a naval officer for life, but he paid special attention to the corps, hoping to serve in the army one day. As soon as the European War broke out, he asked his father for permission to serve in the land army. Therefore, the Gazette on August 12 published his appointment as a second lieutenant in the 1st Battalion of the Grenadier Guards. Then, he repeatedly asked to go to the front line, but he was not allowed. One day, he personally begged Kitchener, saying, "What harm would it do if I died in battle? There is someone else to replace me." Kitchener replied, "Even if I dare to decide that Your Highness will die in battle, I will stop Your Highness. It is not worth it. But our front line is not yet fixed, and I do not want the enemy to have the opportunity to capture Your Highness alive." A few months later, he got his wish. On November 17, he was appointed as an adjutant in the staff of the British Commander, Sir John French. Because of this, he was able to join the new era of tactics near the front line. In the spring of 1915, during the Battle of Neuve Chapelle, he had been reassigned as the signal officer of the General Staff of the French Army. Soon, he returned home with the battle report on this decisive battle from the British Commander-in-Chief. French praised him in the report, saying, "The Crown Prince has been in the army for a short time, but he has quickly become familiar with the affairs of the various departments of the army, and he is very concerned about the comfort of the soldiers. I am deeply moved. The Crown Prince often went to the battlefield and hospitals to comfort the soldiers, and the officers and soldiers were deeply grateful. On one occasion, he did his duty in the trenches of his battalion." The Crown Prince soon returned to the war zone. In June 1916, when he came of age, he was still in the army. In March 1916, he was transferred to the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force. After arriving at the Ismailiya headquarters, he became friends with the new fortresses and spent some time in the army on the battlefield. After staying in Egypt for several weeks, he returned to France. On the way, he visited the Italian front line and went to the front line with the Italian commander at the Lower Isonzo, and inspected the Vosso front line. During his service in France, he encountered many dangerous things, almost losing his life. One day in 1915, when he was traveling by car to a place near the trenches, the German artillery fire was very fierce. He got out of the car and walked forward. Unexpectedly, a bullet flew over, destroying his car and killing his driver. One afternoon, the Crown Prince suddenly disappeared. The staff was shocked. Soon, they learned that he had gone to the regiment to which he belonged to participate in the battle. He returned safely, and everyone was greatly relieved. In the spring of 1918, he was promoted to the rank of major in the army.</p>
<p>After the armistice, the Crown Prince gradually engaged in public life. He often attended Parliament, but did not speak. He occasionally gave speeches outside Parliament. His words were humorous and full of common sense, and he was always able to express the opinions of the people on the road. Therefore, the Crown Prince was known for being able to understand the people's feelings. In 1919, he went to Canada and became friends with the Prairie Indians, who gave him the name "Morning Star". He then visited the Rocky Mountains and crossed the border to Washington, D.C., where he visited the American president. He then arrived in New York and received the "Freedom" of the city. In the spring of the same year, he went to Australia and laid the foundation stone for the capital of Australia in Canberra. In 1921, he went to India and was warmly welcomed. He then went to Japan and returned home in June. In 1925, he went to West Feinanfei, and then to South America, visiting Uruguay, Argentina, and Chile. In 1923, 1924, and 1927, he visited Canada for short trips. In September 1928, he went to East Africa. The British possessions in Africa were the only area that his travels had not reached. This trip was purely for pleasure. He prepared his own funds. Soon, he received the news that King George was critically ill. He rushed back to London by land and sea. The 6,000-mile journey was completed in nine days, setting a record. When he arrived at the sickbed, his parents were greatly relieved. In 1929, he began to take on heavy responsibilities, serving as a regent and representing his father at various ceremonies. The Crown Prince's actions were always planned in a table weeks in advance. He was active almost every day of the year. In the spring of 1930, King George's health recovered, and the Crown Prince was able to return to East Africa to continue his unfinished journey. He traveled throughout the continent by land, sea, and air, returning after three and a half months. In 1929, the Crown Prince often traveled by plane himself. He once sold his hunting dog and bought a plane. In the spring of 1931, the Crown Prince traveled to South America again. This was the beginning of the development of his life's work. After returning home, he worked hard to promote industry and commerce. In this year and the following year, he gave many speeches to industrial and commercial groups, urging manufacturers to closely study foreign markets to promote the sales of British goods. He also made many suggestions. Listeners did not expect that the Crown Prince knew so much about the latest production and sales methods. Although his words sometimes did not agree with the intentions of overseas traders, the Crown Prince was not discouraged and continued to work hard. In the spring of 1932, the Crown Prince gave a speech at the Albert Hall in London, advising the young people of the country to work together to engage in social affairs to help the unemployed. Immediately, there was a response from all sides. Social education movements and production groups were established throughout the country to seek happiness for the unemployed. The Crown Prince also traveled throughout the country to promote the movement. In several places, small items manufactured by the unemployed sold very quickly due to his suggestions. In this year, he traveled to Denmark, Sweden, and Northern Ireland. In the summer of 1933, the trade treaties signed between Britain and Denmark were largely due to this trip. The Crown Prince had used hunting as his fitness method for many years, but recently he gradually became fond of golf. He has a deep understanding of this technique. In the past three years, in addition to representing King George at various ceremonies, the Crown Prince has continued to work hard to develop British trade and seek livelihoods for the unemployed.

<h3>The Solemn Scene Was Truly Moving: The Golden Coffin Arrived in London, Displayed at Westminster Abbey, and 100,000 People Paid Their Last Respects</h3>
<p>London: The solemn scene when the golden coffin of the late King George V was transported from Sandringham to London by train today was truly moving. In Sandringham, crowds wearing black gauze stood silently on both sides of the snow-covered streets, bidding their beloved monarch a final farewell. The crowds gathered in London were larger than any seen in recent years, hoping to catch a glimpse of this simple, dignified, and unforgettable ceremony. Despite the large numbers, there was silence, which shows that the people's love for the late King came from the bottom of their hearts. A short religious service was held in Sandringham Church today, and then the hearse set off, slowly advancing towards the station, a distance of two and a half miles, taking an hour to complete. The golden coffin was placed on a gun carriage, with four guards walking on either side, and a flautist playing a mournful tune. The new King Edward, with a look of grief, followed closely behind the carriage, followed by his brothers, all wearing thick fur coats. Queen Mother Mary, the Duchess of York, and the princesses followed in curtained carriages, followed by several cars carrying the ladies-in-waiting and the two nuns who had attended to the late King during his illness. The late King's favorite white horse, Jock, and his inseparable parrot, Charlotte, also accompanied their late master to London. The loss of people and things makes those who see it feel melancholy. The train traveled slowly, and when it arrived at King's Cross Station, the new King disembarked first, helping his mother down. Then the golden coffin was transferred to a gun carriage, pulled by a squadron of the Royal Horse Artillery, escorted by guards on both sides, and led by mounted police. The golden coffin was draped with the royal standard, with the royal crown and the Queen Mother's wreath placed on top. The new King still walked closely behind the gun carriage, followed by his brothers and the Earl of Harewood, with the mounted police bringing up the rear. The procession slowly proceeded through the dense crowds, taking an hour to travel two and a half miles to Westminster Abbey. At that time, the sound of cannons boomed and the bells tolled, adding to the solemnity. The Queen Mother, the princesses, and the royal duchesses entered a car and went directly to Buckingham Palace, barely seen by anyone. After a short stay, they went to Westminster Abbey, wearing thick veils, to wait for the coffin. The Archbishop of Canterbury formally received the golden coffin. Many viewers remembered the scene when the late King visited the Abbey on May 8th last year to receive the congratulations of Parliament on the 25th anniversary of his reign, amidst the splendid decorations. They could not help but feel the contrast between then and now. Today, all the decorations were gone. The great bell struck four times, the Abbey doors slowly opened, and the ushers moved towards the altar to light four candles. Then the guards carried the golden coffin to the altar, led by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Grand Master of Ceremonies. The new King, the Queen Mother, and others followed closely behind the coffin. After it was placed properly, the royal family members stood at the head of the coffin, and the officials took their places. The Archbishop then announced the start of the prayer service. The choir then sang hymns. After the service, the new King and the Queen Mother left the Abbey and returned to Buckingham Palace by car. The nobles and members of Parliament then slowly walked out through both sides of the altar. Four soldiers of the inner court and four guards were left to guard the coffin day and night. Then the doors of the Abbey were closed again, to make public the final arrangements for the public to pay their respects. From 8:00 a.m. tomorrow, the public will be allowed to enter the Abbey. When the carriage was on its way, the Maltese cross on the crown, inlaid with an Indian gem, suddenly fell off on the way. An officer picked it up and put it in his pocket. After the service at Westminster Abbey, the cross was placed back on the crown. (Reuter's dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>London: The special train carrying the golden coffin of the late British King from Hooton station to London will arrive at King's Cross Station at 2:30 p.m. today. Then it will be transferred to a gun carriage and taken to Westminster Abbey for public viewing. There will be mounted police and civilian police to clear the way. There are 6,000 police officers. The period for public viewing will be from tomorrow until January 27, from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. daily. It is estimated that at least one million people will pay their respects. (Reuter's dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>London: The golden coffin of King George of England is enshrined in Westminster Abbey for public viewing. Yesterday, over 100,000 British people came here to pay their last respects to their beloved and respected monarch. When the curtain was first lifted, the Queen Mother presented a new wreath, made of white chrysanthemums in the shape of a cross, and placed it in front of the coffin. Yesterday was rainy, which made the atmosphere even more depressing. However, the number of people coming to pay their respects did not decrease due to the rain. Today, the number of people coming to pay their respects is even greater than yesterday. They gathered on the banks of the River Thames in order to be admitted to the Abbey. On the 1.75-mile road from Westminster, there was hardly any space left for the waiting crowds. The police department has transferred a large number of police officers from other places to maintain order. Traffic in the three-mile area around the Abbey is extremely inconvenient.

<h3>The Death of the Late King Caused Universal Grief: Condolence Telegrams Arrived Like Snowflakes</h3>
<p>London: The people of the British Empire, from South Africa to North America, were greatly saddened by the news of the death of King George V of England. Before the New Year, the radio broadcast the King's wishes for health and prosperity to all parts of the British Empire. Now, less than a month later, the radio broadcasts the sad news of the King's death. According to Reuter's dispatches, the shock of the King's death was the same as in England. Reuter's Paris dispatch said that after the bad news arrived in Paris, everyone was talking about it, and people could be seen stopping and standing in silence on the streets. French officials recalled the late King's wisdom, humility, and loyalty. Minister Herriot told people in Lyon that King George had protected the freedom of the people and set an example for working for the public good. His dignified behavior was admired by France. Reuter's Washington dispatch said that President Roosevelt had telegraphed King Edward VIII, expressing the deep sympathy of the American people and offering condolences to the Queen Mother. Reuter's Doorn dispatch said that King George was the cousin of the deposed German Emperor, so the deposed German Emperor could not sleep after hearing the news of the King's death at night, and was filled with grief. German leader Hitler telegraphed condolences to King Edward VIII, saying that he was very saddened by the shocking news. The German government and people expressed their sympathy for the great loss suffered by the British royal family and Britain. A statement issued by German officials said that the death of the King had aroused the sadness and sympathy of the entire German people. Although the British government was an enemy in the European War, the German people respected the British King as a chivalrous man who had done his best to restore the broken relations between the two countries after the European War. Reuter's New York dispatch said that the first reaction of the American people after hearing the news of the King's death was deep sympathy for the British people. According to Reuter's Rome dispatch, the Italian people expressed sympathy and mourning. Reuter's Ottawa dispatch said that from the Atlantic to the Pacific, Canadians, both men and women, old and young, were saddened by the death of the King. Many politicians issued obituaries. Canadian Prime Minister King telegraphed King Edward VIII, expressing the condolences of the entire Canadian people. Reuter's Peking dispatch said that many people in Peking shed tears after hearing the bad news of the King's death. (Reuter's dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>The New British Monarch Is Still Single and Does Not Want to Stick to Traditional Rules</h3>
<p>London: When the Prince of Wales acceded to the throne, he took the reign name Edward VIII (his grandfather was Edward VII). The new monarch is not yet married. Since 1760 (when George III acceded to the throne, and did not marry until a year later), this is the only time that a British monarch has acceded to the throne as a bachelor. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>London: After acceding to the throne, the new King Edward VIII did not follow traditional rules in some trivial matters, which shows that the new King does not want to be bound by tradition and intends to present himself as a modern monarch. This impression on public opinion is very profound. These trivial matters include the following: 1. In the royal address to Parliament, the King traditionally refers to himself as "We," but now he directly refers to himself as "I." 2. The new King flew by plane from Sandringham to London, and when he returned to Sandringham, he did not take the royal train, but took a regular first-class passenger train. 3. After the death of the late King, the whole country should mourn, causing all businesses to stop. Now, the new King has only ordered all institutions to mourn for nine months. 4. The new King has decided to abandon the traditional Buckingham Palace and reside in St. James's Palace. It is generally believed that although the new King does not want to adhere to established practices, the conservative elements in Britain are very powerful and can be an obstacle.

After Reuter's relayed the bad news to the Hong Kong government and the naval and land authorities, flags were immediately flown at half-mast everywhere, and church bells rang to express mourning. The University of Hong Kong has suspended classes, and movie theaters and other entertainment venues will also be closed. The festivities of the Chinese Lunar New Year will be greatly reduced as a result, which is also a way to express sympathy. (Reuter's dispatch, 21st)</p>

<h3>A Brief History of the Late King George V</h3>
<p>King George V of England was the younger son of King Edward VII and the grandson of Queen Victoria. He was born in London on June 3, 1865. At the age of twelve, he and his elder brother, the Duke of Clarence, enrolled as naval cadets on the training ship HMS Britannia. After two years, the brothers were ordered to cruise the seas aboard the British fleet's sailing ship HMS Bacchante. They received the same treatment as other naval cadets, traveling through the West Indies, South Africa, Australia, Japan, China, Egypt, and Palestine before returning to London in August 1882. The following year, he served in the navy, diligently performing his duties. He rose from naval officer cadet to the rank of captain. At the age of twenty-four, he began to take charge independently, serving as captain of a first-class torpedo boat. After two years, he was granted the title of Duke of York. Not long after, he suffered a serious illness. Shortly after recovering, his elder brother, the Duke of Clarence, suddenly passed away after a brief illness. Thus, George had to leave active naval service and assume the greater responsibility of heir to the throne. This occurred in January 1892.</p>
<p>On July 6 of the following year, George married Princess Mary. George was twenty-eight years old, and the Princess was twenty-six. The couple was deeply devoted, never disagreeing throughout their lives. They had six children: the eldest, Edward, the Prince of Wales; the Duke of York, Albert; Princess Mary; the Duke of Gloucester, Henry; the Duke of Kent, George; and the youngest, John, who died of illness in January 1919 at the young age of fourteen.</p>
<p>After George ascended the throne, Queen Mary, with her simplicity, set an example for families and assisted her husband in handling state affairs. Having received a good upbringing and being fond of learning, she possessed a pure and honest nature and far-reaching vision. The couple shared a common ambition to love the people and serve diligently. The British people considered it a blessing to have such a queen mother, and the King considered having such a capable wife as the greatest happiness of his life. One day, an old friend asked the King which minister in the court was most helpful. The King replied without hesitation, "My wife." The King's deep affection and unwavering trust in the Queen, expressed in these few words, spoke volumes. Therefore, in British history, no King and Queen have been as closely united in public life as George and Mary. Their names will forever be mentioned together, remaining in the memory of the British people.</p>
<p>In 1901, Queen Victoria passed away. George was ordered to accompany his wife, Mary, on a tour of the entire empire. At that time, their four sons were still young, the eldest being only seven years old and the youngest just one year old. They were all entrusted to Queen Alexandra for care. From departure to return, it took eight months, covering 45,000 miles and visiting seventeen colonies. Upon their return, Edward VII, pleased with their accomplishments, bestowed upon him the title of Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester.</p>
<p>On May 6, 1910, King Edward VII passed away, and George ascended the throne. The following morning, he convened a meeting of the Privy Council and announced to the assembly, "Following the rules of my father and upholding the constitution will be my most ardent wish throughout my life." On June 22 of the same year, the coronation ceremony was held, and the entire country rejoiced. The King and Queen toured Dublin and Scotland, receiving an extremely warm welcome from the people. Subsequently, they traveled to India, where they received the greatest respect from various princes and the Indian people. It was the first time a British King had ever visited India.</p>
<p>In late July 1914, the clouds of war loomed over Europe. The King was deeply concerned. He would rise from his bed at two in the morning to summon the Prime Minister to consider earnestly persuading the Russian Emperor to cease mobilization, but to no avail. By August 4, the British government and the public felt that, for the sake of preserving the nation's survival, they had no choice but to resort to arms. In the four years that followed, the King was constantly in distress, diligently attending to state affairs day and night without a moment's rest. Three months after the outbreak of the war, the King personally went to France to encourage the soldiers of the allied nations, inspect hospitals, and comfort the wounded. At that time, the King's eldest son was also serving in the military. The second son, while inspecting the western front, fell from his horse and was injured, but fortunately, the ground was soft, and the injury was not serious. The third son went to France and approached the front lines, where the French artillery fire shook the earth, but the King remained calm. The King also inspected the large fleets anchored in distant stations. While in the country, he frequently accompanied the Queen to hospitals throughout the land to comfort the wounded and visit munitions factories to encourage the workers. At the end of the war, the King and Queen celebrated their silver wedding anniversary. The citizens of London donated 53,000 pounds to express their respect, and the King donated all of it to charitable causes.</p>
<p>On November 11, 1918, when news of the signing of the armistice agreement reached London, the people rejoiced. Tens of thousands of people gathered outside Buckingham Palace, cheering, "We want to see King George!" The King then led the Queen onto the palace balcony to show their appreciation to the crowd. The scene was unprecedented. On October 10, 1919, the King personally signed the peace treaty, thus ending the greatest war in history, and all of Europe saw the return of peace.</p>
<p>In 1921, the King and Queen traveled to Belfast to attend the opening ceremony of the newly established Parliament of Northern Ireland, urging all the people of Ireland to respect peace, resolve their differences, and be friendly to each other. As a result, the Irish Agreement was established, and Southern Ireland established the Irish Free State government, with both Northern and Southern Ireland moving towards self-governance. In 1923, the King visited Italy to pay respects at the cemeteries of fallen soldiers. Many British soldiers were buried there, and the King could not help but sigh, repeatedly expressing his hope that the world would never again consider war an unavoidable burden for humanity. On Remembrance Day in 1928, the King stood bareheaded in the rain to pay tribute at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and caught a cold, which soon developed into a serious illness. His condition was quite critical, lasting for five months. It was not until mid-April of the following year that he was able to go out for a drive. Although he suffered several minor relapses afterward, he recovered quickly with proper medical treatment and resumed his duties and recreation. However, as the gold reserves flowed out steadily and the British budget could not be balanced, the King felt that the situation was perilous and had to personally attend to all matters. On August 21, he rushed back to London from his vacation in Balmoral. The next morning, at 8:10, he arrived at Buckingham Palace. After finishing breakfast, he immediately summoned Prime Minister MacDonald to the palace and spoke with him for over an hour. He then separately summoned Baldwin and Samuel to inquire about everything, intending to first understand the attitudes of the various parties and then work towards balancing the budget and addressing other financial difficulties. On September 20, due to the urgency of the situation, the cabinet convened an emergency meeting and decided to abandon the gold standard. At that time, the King was still in Balmoral, where he convened a cabinet meeting on Sunday afternoon and signed an order authorizing the Royal Commission to approve the new legislation on his behalf. The next day, the bill to abandon the gold standard was presented to Parliament and was passed by both houses in a single session, with the Royal Commission approving it. On October 6, at the request of the cabinet members, the King ordered the dissolution of Parliament. As a result of the general election, MacDonald and the National Government won a great victory. The King made decisive decisions without hesitation when faced with major events concerning the safety of the nation. The King's talent for leading the nation was most evident during the period from August to October of that year.</p>
<p>May 6, 1935, marked the 25th anniversary of the King's accession to the throne. Preparations for large-scale celebrations began months in advance. On the appointed day, hundreds of thousands of people from all over the country came to the capital to participate in the grand ceremony. The entire country took a holiday to celebrate together. Countries all over the world sent congratulatory messages. The King delivered a radio address to the nation, which could be heard even in China and Japan in the Far East. On June 7 of the same year, the National Government was reorganized. MacDonald resigned as Prime Minister and was replaced by Baldwin. On July 7, the King reviewed the Air Force at Mildenhall, the first time a British monarch had reviewed the Air Force. On the same day, twenty squadrons of the Air Force flew past the King, who watched with pleasure. On July 9, he reviewed the Army at Rushmoor, where 149,000 soldiers from the infantry, cavalry, artillery, and tank corps participated. On July 16, he reviewed the Navy at Spithead, where over 160 warships of all sizes from the Mediterranean Fleet, the Home Fleet, and the Reserve Fleet participated in the ceremony. The King spent two days aboard the royal yacht among the fleets. After the review, the King led the fleet into the sea for a large-scale exercise, with 90 warships participating. On July 21, he reviewed 8,000 police officers representing police forces from across the country in Hyde Park. The accession celebration ceremony was then concluded.</p>
<p>Of the King's children, one son and one daughter survive today. The eldest son, the Prince of Wales, is over forty years old and has not yet married. The other, Princess Mary, married Viscount Lascelles in 1922 and had a son the following year. The second son, Albert, married in 1923 and had a daughter three years later, who was the King's first grandchild. The youngest son, George, married Princess Marina of Greece in 1934.</p>
<p>The King deeply understood that all his actions were limited by the nation's constitution, so he never attempted to overstep his authority. At the same time, he never dared to slacken in his responsibility as the head of state and also as the first servant of the nation. Having experienced hardship from a young age, the King, upon ascending the throne and handling all matters of state, was able to perform his duties sincerely and joyfully. The King's governance was swift and accurate, and cabinet members never complained about delays in his decisions. Whenever faced with a matter, the King worked tirelessly day and night, without the slightest confusion. He never delayed what could be done today until tomorrow. He always relied on the intentions of the cabinet members and never acted on his own.</p>
<p>The King's sole objective in life was to increase the happiness of his people. The King firmly adhered to the principle that peace and goodwill among all sectors were the most important factors for national interest and the welfare of the people. Therefore, the King never forgot to closely unite the various territories of the empire and promote goodwill, believing that this was the most solid hope for the prosperity of the common people and the most solid guarantee for world peace.</p>
<p>Now, as the Italo-Ethiopian War is in full swing and European countries are mobilizing their troops to prevent major changes, and as the Naval Conference concerning world peace has broken down, the future is unpredictable. The sudden passing of this wise European monarch at this time is not only a cause for regret for Britain but also for the entire world. Fortunately, the Prince of Wales is in the prime of his life and has extensive experience and knowledge. Once he ascends the throne, he will surely carry on his father's legacy and enhance it. This is a predictable outcome. (Reuters)</p>

The full text is as follows: Regarding Japan's diplomatic issues, I will now describe the recent developments and express my views, which I consider a great honor. In recent times, Japan's international standing has been steadily rising, and its responsibilities have also become increasingly significant. Fortunately, Japan's intention to contribute to ensuring genuine world peace has gradually permeated the world, and various countries have recognized that Japan is wholeheartedly striving for stability in East Asia. I am extremely pleased that the establishment of Japan's good-neighborly relations is being gradually realized. Japan's ally, "Manchukuo," has been making progress and development in recent years, which is not only commendable but also strengthens its relationship with Japan. Therefore, Japan has decided to gradually abolish all extraterritorial rights in that country and adjust the administrative rights of the Manchurian Railway attached areas to assist in the independent development of "Manchukuo." The close and inseparable relationship between Japan and "Manchukuo," in addition to the established joint defense, should be strengthened through economic cooperation between the two countries. Thus, the establishment of the Japan-Manchukuo Economic Joint Committee has been seen. The upright existence and sound development of this newly emerging "Manchukuo" are necessary conditions for stabilizing East Asia. We should strive to achieve this goal, enhance the country's international standing, and promote good-neighborly relations with neighboring countries. In other words, we should make the greatest efforts to adjust the relations between China, Japan, and Manchukuo on the one hand and to handle the relations between Japan, Manchukuo, and Russia on the other.</p>
<p>Restating the Three Principles - Looking further at the relations between China, Japan, and Manchukuo, although these relations have been gradually improving, they cannot be said to have returned to normal. Therefore, we deeply feel that it is necessary to take further steps to fully normalize these relations and strengthen the foundation for stability in East Asia. As a result, the Japanese government, after careful deliberation, has established a firm policy toward China. This policy consists of the following three main points: The first point concerns the fundamental adjustment of relations between China and Japan. The two countries should actively cooperate to achieve genuine friendship and cooperation. Mutual confrontation between China and Japan is not only detrimental to both parties but also intolerable from the perspective of the overall situation in East Asia. However, if China is fully aware of this point, Japan is ready to provide tangible and intangible assistance for China's development, which goes without saying. Japan has always taken a broad perspective and exercised restraint. The Japanese government clarified its fundamental policy of not threatening or invading neighboring countries at the 67th session of the Diet and endeavored to use opportunities to restore normal relations between the two countries to make progress in adjusting their interests. However, it is regrettable that sufficient results have not been seen to date. For the complete restoration of normal relations between China and Japan, it is necessary to put the relationship between China and Manchukuo on the right track, which goes without saying. The various interests of China, Japan, and Manchukuo, which are in direct contact in North China, make this particularly important. However, because China has not yet recognized "Manchukuo," which is connected to North China, and because of the special local traditions that have been passed down for a long time in the north, an atmosphere of unease has temporarily appeared in North China. As mentioned above, it is difficult to achieve stability in East Asia without adjusting the direct relations between China and Japan and simultaneously adjusting the relations between China, Japan, and Manchukuo. The second point of Japan's determined policy is to achieve this goal: The instability in East Asia provides an opportunity for the Red Movement to take advantage of. Although the danger of the Red Movement is not limited to the East Asian region, its activities are particularly blatant in East Asia. Therefore, for the sake of stability in East Asia and the world, preventing the Red Movement in East Asia and enabling China to escape this danger is not only an important issue for China but also a major event common to all countries. This is the third point of the determined policy: Japan intends to cooperate with China in various ways to prevent the Red Movement. The above three points are the Japanese government's determined policy. In reality, this is not a new idea. It is a natural and fundamental concept for achieving the great goal of stabilizing East Asia. Therefore, its spirit can be called a common policy for the countries of East Asia.</p>
<p>Relations Between Japan, Russia, and Manchukuo - With regard to the relations between Japan, Manchukuo, and Russia, the Japanese government has consistently strived for peace and friendship. The successful acquisition of the Chinese Eastern Railway was to eliminate the obstacles that had spanned the three countries for many years. Because Japan bears the obligation of joint defense with "Manchukuo," the political and military relations of the country adjacent to "Manchukuo" automatically have a direct impact on Japan. Therefore, special attention must be paid to the relationship between Japan and Manchukuo. "Manchukuo" and Soviet Russia have a long common border, and disputes frequently occur due to unclear border points. Currently, the establishment of a joint committee to resolve these disputes is being considered. However, the "Manchukuo" government insists that it is first necessary to demarcate the unclear borders. The issue of greatest concern to us in the relations between Japan, Manchukuo, and Russia is that Soviet Russia is excessively developing its military capabilities in Eastern Siberia, its colony on the border. Because this matter directly stimulates the people of "Manchukuo" and the people of Japan, we take every opportunity to request the Soviet Russian authorities to consider this point.

<p>Washington - Senior naval authorities today believed that as a result of the dissolution of the Japanese parliament, the international naval competition may be temporarily avoided because the dissolution of the parliament indicates that Japan is unwilling to immediately begin naval competition. Those responsible here said that it is still unknown whether Japan intends to start building submarines and other special types of ships. However, judging from the wording of Foreign Minister Hirota's speech yesterday, Japan may be satisfied with the freedom it has gained after the abolition of the Washington Treaty. However, Hirota's statement did not explain Japan's intentions, so it must be viewed with a very reserved eye. (National News Telegram on the 21st)</p>
<p>London - The Japanese delegation has accepted the invitation and agreed to send members to observe the four-power naval conference. (Reuters Telegram on the 20th)</p>
<p>Dalian - Japanese Ambassador to "Manchukuo," Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army, Governor of the Leased Territory, General Minami, is currently inspecting the leased territory. After arriving here from Changchun today, he issued a message to the people, urging them to redouble their determination to cope with national difficulties. He said that Japan must now cope with an unfriendly world alone, so this determination is absolutely necessary. At the beginning of the new year, the Japanese delegation withdrew from the London Naval Conference and dissolved the Imperial Parliament. These events have greatly increased the national difficulties. Japan first withdrew from the League of Nations and now from the Naval Conference. It is now free internationally but like an orphan, no longer able to rely on others and must rely on its own strength, especially to consolidate spiritual unity and develop industrial independence, to show its greatest loyalty. All Japanese people have this solemn obligation. The Kwantung Army's policy has not changed. Its main mission is to assist the smooth development of "Manchukuo." The current methods for coping with difficulties are as follows: 1. As soon as possible, entrust the responsibility of maintaining the security of "Manchukuo" to the Manchurian military police to relieve Japan's burden in Manchuria. 2. Sincerely support the abolition of extraterritorial rights so that "Manchukuo" can truly be independent. 3. Develop the industries of "Manchukuo." 4. Demarcate the border between "Manchukuo" and Mongolia to promote friendship and fundamentally resolve the constant border disputes. 5. Quickly realize the friendship between China, Japan, and "Manchukuo." (Reuters Telegram on the 20th)</p>
<h3>New Border Disputes Between Manchukuo and Mongolia, Both Sides Lodge Protests, Japanese and Manchukuo Troops Open Fire with Machine Guns, Mongolian Border Guards Retaliate</h3>
<p>It has been learned here that Japanese and Manchukuo troops have again provoked Mongolia. On January 22, a unit of Japanese and Manchukuo troops, traveling in three trucks (with five more trucks hidden), rushed to the Mongolian border defense post. The post is located in Genghis Khan, near Lake Khara-Nuur, 25 kilometers from the border. The Japanese and Manchukuo troops immediately opened fire with machine guns to cover their advance towards the defense post. The Mongolian border guards retaliated fiercely, and the Japanese and Manchukuo troops retreated towards the border, leaving one dead and one light machine gun behind. During the retreat, the Japanese and Manchukuo troops kidnapped two Mongolian soldiers, whose whereabouts are currently unknown. (TASS Telegram on the 24th)</p>
<p>Moscow - Reports from Kuren state that Japanese and Manchukuo troops attacked the Mongolian border defense station (Genghis Khan, near Lake Khara-Nuur in Mongolian territory) on the 22nd. The government of the Mongolian People's Republic has protested to Manchukuo, demanding that Manchukuo immediately cease its provocative actions of invading Mongolian territory and its systematic attacks on Mongolian border guards. The Mongolian side further stated that such provocative actions are continuing to occur and will have serious consequences in the future, for which Manchukuo will bear full responsibility. (TASS Telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>Dalian - The Foreign Minister of "Manchukuo" today issued two stern notes to Outer Mongolia, warning that if violent acts occur again on the border, unfortunate consequences will inevitably follow. The first note states that on January 14, 15, and 17, Outer Mongolian soldiers invaded the border, demanding the immediate return of the captured people and their property and guaranteeing that such acts will not occur again in the future. The second note refutes Outer Mongolia's letter of January 12, stating that it is purely a sophistical argument and that if there are any more actions that incite anger and hostility towards "Manchukuo," Outer Mongolia must bear the consequences.

<h3>Passing of Two Resolutions: League of Nations Administrative Council Meeting Concludes; Urges Swift Negotiations Between Russia and Uruguay; Settlement of Danzig Issue Attributed to Eden's Mediation</h3>
<p>Geneva - The current session of the League of Nations Administrative Council recently concluded in Geneva. Before adjourning, the Council passed two resolutions. One registered the agreement reached between British Foreign Secretary Eden and representatives of the Free City of Danzig (see separate dispatch). The second addressed the dispute between the Soviet Union and Uruguay arising from their severing of diplomatic relations. It stated, in essence, "The Uruguayan representative has not been able to present evidence, as requested by the Soviet representative, to substantiate the Uruguayan government's accusations against the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Administrative Council hopes that the suspension of diplomatic relations between the two countries is only temporary." (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>New York - Uruguay, in South America, previously expelled the Russian ambassador from Uruguay due to alleged subversive revolutionary conspiracies. Russia, claiming Uruguay's action violated the League of Nations Covenant, appealed to the League. Today, the League rapporteur presented a proposal stating that the interruption of diplomatic relations between Russia and Uruguay is temporary. The League of Nations Administrative Council requests both parties to restore friendly relations and refrain from any actions that could endanger peace. This case was thus resolved. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>New York - Regarding the dispute between Soviet Russia and Uruguay, rapporteur and Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu recently submitted a draft resolution to Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov and Uruguayan representative Guani. The content states: 1. Any nation has the freedom to establish or sever diplomatic relations with other nations. 2. Uruguay failed to present evidence regarding its accusation of Soviet Russian interference in its internal affairs. 3. A strong hope that the two parties concerned will promptly resume diplomatic negotiations. It is reported that Litvinov has already expressed his acceptance. Guani sought instructions from his government at noon today but has not yet received a reply. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Geneva - The dispute over the Nazi Party's mistreatment of minorities in the Free City of Danzig was fully resolved after negotiations this morning.

(Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Geneva - The League of Nations High Commissioner for the Free City of Danzig, Lester, previously submitted a report to the Administrative Council exposing the Free City Senate's violations of the Free City constitution. After accepting the report, the Administrative Council appointed British Foreign Secretary Eden as rapporteur to handle the matter together with representatives of the Free City of Danzig. The representative agreed to amend two draft laws proposed by the City Senate, which Lester considered to violate the constitution. Therefore, the Danzig issue has come to an end. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>China's Request for Council Seat: League of Nations Tacitly Acknowledges Reasonableness; More Than Ten Nations Express Support; Decision to be Made in April</h3>
<p>Geneva - The League of Nations Administrative Council's Organization Committee, at its meeting tonight, resolved to hand over the case of China's request for a semi-permanent council seat to the Secretariat. The Secretariat will first collect materials and formulate methods, and a decision will be made at the meeting on April 27th. Chinese representative Guo Taiqi proposed that Sir Cecil serve as the rapporteur for this case and present a report at the decision-making meeting, which was accepted by the meeting. (Central News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Geneva - This afternoon, when the League of Nations Administrative Council's Organization Committee met to discuss China's request for a semi-permanent council seat, Chinese representative Guo Taiqi immediately stated that the Administrative Council had tacitly acknowledged the reasonableness of China's request, which is why this committee was specially formed and convened a meeting in September of last year to decide to notify member states to express their opinions. At several committee meetings, six members explicitly expressed their support for China's request, which he was very pleased about. Subsequently, the Secretariat received written replies from a total of eighteen countries, of which thirteen expressed their support. The replies of the other five countries made suggestions regarding the organization of the Administrative Council but did not affect China's request at all. The current organization of the Administrative Council clearly fails to comply with the repeated resolutions of the General Assembly that the distribution of Council seats should be based on geographical considerations. When the Organization Committee met in 1926, Chairman Motta stated that if the number of permanent Council seats were increased, the representation of countries and continents around the world would be more balanced. However, since 1926, although the number of non-permanent Council seats has increased, and the number of Asian member states has also increased, the Council seats are uniquely lacking in representation from Asia. He hoped that the meeting would pay attention to this. (Central News Agency, 24th)</p>

<h3>Laval Resigns; New French Cabinet Formed; Sarraut Becomes Premier, Flandin Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Paris - The Laval cabinet recently submitted its resignation to President Lebrun. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Paris - New Premier Sarraut has now formed a new cabinet, concurrently serving as Minister of the Interior. The foreign affairs portfolio goes to Flandin, while the Minister of Finance and the Minister of the Navy remain unchanged. General Maurin has been appointed Minister of War, Pengu has been appointed Minister without Portfolio, and Chaudanne has been appointed Minister of Public Works. This new cabinet is effectively a joint Sarraut-Flandin cabinet. Sarraut fully supports the League of Nations, while Flandin is known to be pro-British. Furthermore, keeping the Minister of Finance unchanged is also very important. This shows that France will continue with the Gold Franc. (Reuters, 25th)</p>

<p>Nanjing - Following the National Government's promulgation of the organization and personnel of the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Council, a reporter from the Central News Agency specifically interviewed Huang Musong to inquire about the establishment process. According to Huang, the Council was originally established based on the requests of officials and civilians of the leagues and banners in Suiyuan Province. When the Central Government established the Mongolian Political Council, it originally intended to aspire to Mongolian autonomy and proceed under a unified organization. However, due to numerous difficulties in the trial implementation, it agreed to the request for divided governance by districts. As for the system of the leagues and banners, it originally belonged to divided governance, and forcibly uniting them was inevitably a case of achieving half the results with twice the effort. Now that the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Council has been established, it can proceed more conveniently by adapting to local conditions. The original Mongolian Political Council can also dedicate itself to the affairs of the Xilin Gol League and the Chahar border area, and the results will be significant. In the future, working together under the central leadership, the future of Mongolian local autonomy, although exhibiting divergence, is particularly optimistic. (Central News Agency, 26th)</p>

<h3>Yellow River Ice Thaws and Accumulates to Great Heights; Chengdong Wangmin Embankment Breached; Water Flows Eastward Along Old Course Rapidly; Efforts to Block the Breach Will Likely Change</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: On July 10th last year, the Yellow River breached the people's embankment at Lishengtun in Juancheng, and then breached the Limu Ji dike, flooding ten counties in western Shandong and northern Jiangsu. The breach has not yet been closed. Over 90% of the river's water now flows through it. However, the water flowing south from Lishengtun makes a large bend, and its flow is not very smooth, gradually tending eastward. At that time, Li Yizhi, chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, proposed to open the north and south people's embankments in Juancheng, guiding the water through the embankment (inside the dike but outside the people's embankment) eastward along the old course of the 14th year of the Republic, entering the river from the old breach at Huanghuasi. He believed that this would change the water flow at the breach, mitigating the disaster situation in western Shandong and northern Jiangsu. However, due to various reasons, this was not implemented. Around October 19th, the southern end of the Juancheng Gedi (i.e., the north-south people's embankment) was again breached by the water. The people of Juancheng then retreated to the embankment further back. At this time, Li Yizhi, already out of office, again requested the Economic Commission to follow this water flow, guiding the Yellow River back to the old course of the 14th year of the Republic, and asked that the officials and people of Juancheng be prohibited from building embankments to obstruct the water. Kong Xiangrong, acting chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, considered this unacceptable, and the matter was again shelved. The officials and people of Juancheng, fearing that the retreated embankment would not hold, worried not only about the city of Juancheng, but also about the ten thousand hectares of farmland in the counties of Fanxian, Yuncheng, and Shouzhang within the embankment, which would be flooded. So, in October, they built a people's embankment from Dongkou on the north of the people's embankment to Wangtan on the south of the dike, called the Dongwang People's Embankment, as a safeguard. Up to the present, because the climate is unstable, the Yellow River ice thaws and freezes alternately. On the evening of the 17th, the retreated embankment breached first, and on the 18th, the Dongwang People's Embankment was also breached. The Yellow River water has automatically returned to the old river course eastward, flowing very rapidly. Judging from this situation, it is not difficult for the Yellow River water to return to the old river course at Huanghuasi. The water originally flowing south from Limu Ji will turn northeast. The shape of the breach will change greatly, and the disaster area in western Shandong and northern Jiangsu will not expand. However, the dike from Limu to Huanghuasi, which has been in disrepair for many years, will become particularly important from now on. It is found that the Dongwang People's Embankment was breached last month, when the weather was severely cold, and the Yellow River in Zhengzhou was very solid. In recent days, the weather has turned warmer, and the ice has thawed and flowed with the water. On the 16th and 17th, it suddenly turned severely cold again, dropping to minus 17.3 degrees Celsius. As a result, the ice blocks re-accumulated and froze, then thawed and froze again. The impact of the ice blocks was very violent. According to a telephone report from Qin Daoyu, magistrate of Juancheng County, to the River Affairs Bureau on the evening of the 17th, at 11 PM, the ice blocks breached the Du Zhuang behind the retreated embankment, and the water flowed northeast. On the 18th, another report was received that the water breached the Dongwang People's Embankment at 2 PM today (the 18th), and the water had reached Dafengl ou. A follow-up report in the evening said that the ice water had passed Zheng Ying Erli at 6 PM, and Xujia Ji Shuli at 10 PM. By the morning of the 19th, it had passed Shuibao. The water was over 20 meters wide and about 1 meter deep (not yet full of the old river channel). On the morning of the 20th, it passed through Fanxian and reached Zhang Tan in Yuncheng, its momentum very smooth. According to general observation, the Yellow River water flowing east from Juancheng, through the old river course, still enters the river from the old breach at Huanghuasi, turning south from Limu Ji, its momentum is smoother. The disaster area in ten counties of western Shandong and northern Jiangsu, due to the cutting off of the water source, may dry up and recover. The breach blocking project, or may also undergo major changes. The River Affairs Bureau's report on the breach is recorded below: Respectfully to Chairman Han Jun of the Provincial Government, Recently received Qiao Dian from Jiang Jiugui, head of the Nan Yi sub-section, stating, that the river water has been rising continuously in recent days, and the small retreated embankment of Du Zhuang (impacted by floating ice, breached at 11 PM the previous evening, with a breach 25 zhang wide and 7 chi deep, the main current rushing straight at the Dongwang New People's Embankment, with multiple breaches occurring, and now due to the frozen ground, it is difficult to obtain soil, and the rush to block it is strenuous, and this morning at 11 AM, a breach occurred at Yan Zhuang, the water head has reached the Cao Zhuang, etc. in the south of Juancheng, etc., apart from rushing to the worksite at dawn to supervise and protect, reporting respectfully, Zhang Lianjia, Director of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau, bowing reverently. Respectfully to Han, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, Kong, Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, concerning the breach of the Juancheng Dongwang People's Embankment by ice impact, and the situation of rushing to the worksite to supervise and protect, has been reported previously, and now it is reported that the water head has reached Zhang Tan in Yuncheng County, still flowing downstream along the old river channel of the 14th year of the Republic, with a width of over 20 meters and a depth of over 1 meter, much of the ice water has not left the channel, apart from supervising and strictly preventing the great embankment, reporting respectfully, Zhang Lianjia, Director of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau, bowing reverently.

<h3>Liu Guitang's Bandit Troops Plotting to Disturb Shandong Again; Troops Loitering Around Daming Area; Han Has Ordered Garrison Troops and Militia to Strictly Guard</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Liu Guitang (i.e., Liu Heiqi) and Zhang Heilian's bandit troops had previously harassed Yixian, Caoxian, and Mengyin in southern Shandong. Around the 17th and 18th years of the Republic, their troops numbered no less than ten thousand, with great momentum. After being pacified and reorganized by the Central Government, they mutinied again. Zhang Heilian was captured by the 3rd Route Special Detective Team last year and executed in Jinan. Liu Guitang, after rebelling in Puyang, had previously crossed the Yellow River in the previous year through Dongming and Puyang along the Jingxing Pingshan area on the border of Chahar, Shanxi and Hebei, disturbing the southwest counties of Shandong again. After Han Fuju led a large army of 60,000 men to pursue and attack them in the Tai'an Jieshou area, he completely defeated several thousand bandits near Anqiu in eastern Shandong. Liu Guitang barely escaped and secretly took a boat from Haizhou in northern Jiangsu to Tianjin. For many years, although Liu Guitang had sent remnants into Shandong several times to secretly engage in activities, they were all captured and executed by the Shandong authorities, failing to achieve their goals. Recently, under the support of outside forces, Liu has gathered followers, reportedly reaching over a thousand, and has several cannons. He seems to be following the old path, disturbing Jingxing and Pingshan, as if he intends to make a comeback and enter Shandong again. Therefore, people in Shandong are paying close attention. Some say that Liu's group has already sneaked into Shandong. On the 23rd, Han Fuju telegraphed Rong Guangxing, Chen Dexin, Zhao Renquan, and other garrison troops and militia in western and northern Shandong, ordering them to strictly guard against it. According to sources in Dezhou, Liu's troops are still near the Pinghan Railway. According to sources in Linqing, Liu's troops had contact with the local defense forces in the Daming area and fled south. According to Han Fuju, Liu Guitang's bandit troops are now in the chaotic mountains west of Shunde and Yongnian. Chairman Ji (Song Zheyuan) is currently sending two regiments of troops to pursue and suppress them. According to reports, Liu seems to want to flee to Shexian in Henan and has other plans. His total bandit forces number about 1600-1700, with about 400-500 mounted bandits. The province has already prepared for defense, based on the experience of annihilating Liu's bandits in the previous year. If Liu's bandits still sneak into Shandong, it is expected that they can be eliminated in the shortest possible time. (24th)</p>
<h3>Foreign Banks in Xiamen Comply with Order to Exchange Legal Tender; Amdach Has Already Exchanged Half; HSBC Will Exchange Soon; No News from Taiwan</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: After the currency reform and the nationalization of silver, all silver stored in banks in Xiamen, belonging to Chinese banks, immediately transferred it to the Central, China, and Communications Banks in compliance with the order. However, foreign banks have not yet implemented it. At the end of December, the American-owned Central Bank of China transferred 600,000 yuan of silver to the Bank of Communications in exchange for legal tender. The British-owned Overseas Chinese Bank also handed over its silver in early January. Although these two banks are foreign-owned, their capital comes from overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. The purely foreign banks include the British HSBC, the Dutch Amdachs and the Japanese Taiwan Bank. Initially, they waited for orders from their head offices and watched. It is said that HSBC has over 1.2 million yuan in silver, Amdachs has 1.1 million, and Taiwan Bank has over 1 million. After January 20th, Amdachs received a telegram from its head office instructing them to exchange the hard currency with the Central Bank for 500,000 yuan in legal tender in two batches. The remaining 600,000 will be exchanged after the Spring Festival. HSBC had already received an order from its head office to comply with the use of legal tender. On the 22nd, the head office in Thailand telegraphed a special order to transfer the entire stock of over 1.2 million yuan in hard currency to the Bank of China for exchange into legal tender. The bank has decided to exchange it with the Bank of China after the Spring Festival. There is no news from the Bank of Taiwan. (January 23rd)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Banking Community Grants Loans to Rescue Commerce - Total Loan Amount 1 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Tianjin commerce has been declining year by year. Before this Spring Festival, the Bank Association, the Money Industry Association, and representatives of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce held several meetings to discuss rescue measures. Until the 17th, it was decided to organize a loan of 1 million yuan for lending. This method is modeled after the Beijing and Tianjin banks' plan to rescue the market. Two weeks ago, the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee established the Beijing-Tianjin Financial Maintenance Association to plan for the lending of cash by banks to support various industries. The Tianjin side instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to handle the loan applicant registration procedures, compile the loan request letters, and transfer them to the Beijing-Tianjin Financial Maintenance Association for discussion with the banks on lending procedures. The Tianjin Chamber of Commerce started registration on January 10th. Merchants in all industries requesting loans must clearly state the amount of the loan, the type of collateral, and the loan period in a confidential letter to the Chamber of Commerce, and wait to be unsealed when the summary is transferred. It is also promised to keep it secret. The original registration period was until the 12th, but due to the large number of loan requests, it was extended for two days, ending on the evening of the 14th. That night, the envelopes were opened and examined, and a total of 187 loan applications were received, mostly from the silk, cloth, yarn, printing, glass, and grocery industries. The chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Ji Hua, originally planned to go to Beijing on the 16th to negotiate, but the Tianjin banking community believed that if it were handled by the Beijing-Tianjin Financial Maintenance Association, the guarantee conditions might not be entirely in line with the bankers' intentions. Therefore, it was decided to directly lend the money, taking the same steps as the banks and money industry in Beijing and Tianjin. On the 17th, the Bank Association decided to organize the Tianjin Municipal Relief Commercial Loan Review Committee, with one representative from the Municipal Government, the Chamber of Commerce, the Bank Association, and the Money Industry Association, and five representatives from the loaning organizations, for a total of nine members of the Review Committee. The nine members mutually elected one person as chairman, and separately hired one appraiser each from the Chamber of Commerce, the Bank Association, the Silver Industry Association, and the Jincheng, Dalu, and Hebei Banks to appraise the collateral submitted by the merchants. As for the loan amount of 1 million yuan, the Central, China, Communications, and other members of the Bank Association will be responsible for 800,000 yuan, the Hebei Province will be responsible for 100,000 yuan, and the money industry associations will be responsible for 100,000 yuan. The Bank of China was publicly elected as the general agency for loan transfers, and a Review Committee charter of 12 articles and loan rules of 15 articles were established. The loan interest rate was set at 7% per month, and the longest loan period was three months. Applicants for loans are limited to merchants and shops in the city that are continuously operating and are members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Each household's loan may not exceed 10,000 yuan. If the request exceeds this amount, the Review Committee will review the applicant's content and collateral situation and handle it at its discretion. The types of collateral submitted by the merchants requesting loans are limited to: 1. Goods, 2. Real estate, and it is stipulated that the maximum value of the goods is 70% of the actual price. If the price of the goods falls or they are sold, the banking group will notify the borrower to increase the collateral. In addition to providing reliable collateral, the merchant requesting the loan should have a general guarantor. Borrowers are not allowed to guarantee each other.</p>

Recently, Hu Hanmin returned to the country. In order to greet Hu and cancel his leave from the Political Affairs Council, Li left Yong on the 17th and passed through Wuzhou on the 18th. On the morning of the 19th, he arrived at Sanshui Kouzhen in Guangdong at 5 AM, transferring to the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway train to Guangzhou. After breakfast that day, Li went to the Southwest Political Affairs Council to cancel his leave and also visited Xiao Focheng, Zou Lu, and Lin Yunge. Mr. Li stated, "I took leave to return to Guangxi some time ago purely to discuss the implementation of the Guangxi Provincial Construction Outline with the military, government, party and other comrades in Guangxi. As a result, the Guangxi Provincial Government decided to re-establish the Construction Department as the responsible agency and internally appointed Zhang Yunsong, commander of the 53rd Division of Guangxi Province, to be transferred to the position of Director of the Construction Department. The department is currently being established and has not yet been established. One of the main items in the construction plan is the establishment of village and street public granaries. The main purpose is to relieve the general poor population. It is stipulated that each village and street must establish a granary, and collect grain for storage at a fixed time each year, collected according to a progressive rate for each household. This stored grain is the public property of the village and street. In the event of floods, droughts, and famines, grain will be sold to provide relief. This is a fundamental self-help method for the people of Guangxi. In recent days, the national crisis is serious. I believe that the authorities should have a basic understanding and a minimum stance on diplomatic issues. At present, the diplomatic policy towards Japan must recognize that the Eastern Neighbor's Continental Policy aims at annexing East Asia and turning China into a colony. The invasion of our Northeast and the current nibbling of North China are just a process. Its ultimate goal is to encompass the entire Asian continent in order to fulfill its Greater East Asia Doctrine. As for our response, we should have a minimum stance. In short, the right to survival of our entire national country cannot be forfeited. The diplomatic authorities should correct past mistakes, make diplomacy public, so that the people have the opportunity to participate and supervise, and then the so-called minimum stance can be consolidated. As for the bandit suppression issue, Guangxi has always participated in the decision to suppress the communists. We do what we see, and we don't have time to consider the title. As the appointment order and official seal for the commander of the three-province bandit suppression have not yet been issued, I cannot discuss when I will take office. As for the Xiao He Communist bandits fleeing to the border areas of Guizhou, Hunan and Guangxi, the Guangxi army has already dispatched troops to intercept them. After suffering heavy blows from both decisions, the bandits have recently returned to Jiangkou and Shiqian in Guizhou. At present, the vanguard troops of the three divisions of the Guangxi army, Wei Yunsong, Zhou Zuhuang, and Wang Zanbin, have stationed in the Duyun Dushan area on the border of Guizhou, looking for opportunities to encircle and suppress them." That afternoon, Li took the Guangzhou-Kowloon Express to Hong Kong to greet Hu. (Evening of January 19th)</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Student Movement Has Turned to the Right Track, Zhongda Students Go to Various Subordinates to Promote, Li Shuzong Inaugurated as Commander of the Righteous Army Corps</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Southwest authorities have consistently adhered to a principle of non-interference in the student movement for several years and have never slightly changed. With the current national crisis being severe and the border defense becoming increasingly urgent, Sun Yat-sen University previously convened a general meeting of all faculty, staff, and workers, held a city-wide parade, and sent telegrams to the national public, urging them to rise up and save the country. Some slogans and catchphrases crossed the line. The Southwest authorities, considering that the student movement was motivated by patriotic enthusiasm and that the parade team was well-organized and maintained very good order, did not suppress it. Subsequently, the students held a second decisive demonstration parade, with participants including Zhongyuan, Zhixin, and other schools in addition to Sun Yat-sen University, numbering no less than several thousand people. Students from various colleges and affiliated high schools of Sun Yat-sen University decided to suspend classes for one month and mobilize entirely to set out to the countryside for propaganda. A total of 225 teams were formed, including university departments and affiliated schools (147 teams from university departments, 40 teams from high schools, and 38 teams from junior high schools). Except for those going to distant provinces, who departed by boat first, the remaining propaganda teams in various counties of this province decided to set off on the 10th of the month. Each team leader must hold a numbered propaganda team flag and carry a letter to compatriots throughout the country and other propaganda materials for distribution to the public. The conference also emphasized that the following points should be paid close attention to when propaganda teams go to various places: a special propaganda outline was prepared, divided into three sections: (A) the meaning of propaganda in other counties, (B) the basic tasks of the propaganda teams in other counties, and (C) key points of propaganda. Furthermore, to regulate the team members, specific rules were drafted for compliance, which are recorded as follows: Strictly enforce discipline; team members must gather frequently and are not allowed to leave the team for the shameful act of going home for the New Year.  Formulate the team's departure route and work procedures.  Investigate the attitude of local governments and party departments.  Before each activity, a team member meeting must be convened in advance to discuss work methods and assign individual tasks.  After each live movement, people from all walks of life must be invited to talk, and you must not focus on forum-style speeches. Use a conversational style so that every person can freely express their opinions.  The language and expressions in talks and speeches should be as popular as possible.  In any gathering or speech, local students and people should be invited to speak as much as possible.  Team members' words and actions should be summarized into a general report. The report should include a joint discussion by all team members, in addition to the work process, and should include self-criticism of the entire team and individual team members. On January 9, while the students of Sun Yat-sen University were free from going to the countryside for propaganda, they once again contacted students from various schools in the city to hold a third demonstration parade. In addition to Sun Yat-sen University, the participants included students from Guangya Middle School, Jiaozhong Middle School, Dazhong Middle School, Zhixin Middle School, Zhongyuan Middle School, and the Municipal Third Vocational School, totaling three to four thousand people. At 2:00 PM, they began parading through the city, and the situation was very volatile. At about 6:00 PM, the large group arrived in front of the Education Department on Huiai West Road, and there was a proposal to petition the Education Department. It happened to be the time when the Education Department was closing work, and no one received them, so the momentum was fierce, and they poured into the hall and carried out sabotage. A student leader gave an order, and the students immediately took bricks and stones and smashed the doors, windows, and electric lights in the hall chief's office and the first, second, third, and fourth sections, the reception hall, and various other places. At the same time, the calligraphy, paintings, full-length mirrors, flower pots, and other items displayed in various places were smashed, but fortunately, the documents were not destroyed. At that time, the special police in the hall returned to the branch office to report, which was forwarded to the Public Security Bureau. By 6:30 PM, the students had left the hall, and the sign of the "Guangdong Provincial Education Department" hanging at the door was removed and stored somewhere. The team did not disperse until 7:30 PM. By the morning of the 10th, Director Huang returned to the hall and immediately ordered the general affairs department to supervise the workers to move away the bricks, tiles, broken windows, doors, electric lights, and other debris and rearrange them. By 9:00 AM, the order had been largely restored, and the staff were working as usual. A portion of the students from Guangya Middle School, after returning to school with the Sun Yat-sen University students after the parade on the 9th, because all of Sun Yat-sen University had set off for propaganda, also convened a meeting that night and decided to request the school to return their food expenses, grant a one-month vacation for rural propaganda, and request that there be no semester make-up exams after returning to school next semester, and that the first-stage grades be doubled and used as the semester score. Starting on the morning of the 10th, they organized a disciplinary team and closed the school gates, and all teachers, staff, and students were not allowed to enter or exit. After the persuasion of many teachers, order was restored at noon on the 11th. Students in the junior high school grades and the first and second grades of high school all went home in the afternoon. The students staying at the school were only a few students in the third grade of high school. It was found that after the students disrupted the Education Department, the authorities were very surprised. The students' patriotic movement has always been sympathized with by the government. The goals and responsibilities of both sides are the same, and they should work together to overcome the national crisis. However, what the students are doing now only increases the government's external difficulties and does not help the actual saving of the country. They should be enlightened, persuaded, and brought into the right track. Therefore, Chen Jitang, Commander-in-Chief of the First Group Army, Lin Yinhai, Chairman of the Provincial Government, Xiao Focheng, a member of the Central Committee, Zou Lu, President of Sun Yat-sen University, Huang Linshu, Director of the Education Department, and Lu Yougang, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, and several others, specially gathered at the Southwest Political Affairs Committee at about 10:00 AM on the 10th to discuss solutions. As a result, the Southwest Political Affairs Committee ordered the Commander-in-Chief of the First Group Army to take responsibility for organizing patriotic men and women students into national salvation volunteer armies and national salvation nursing teams for separate training, in order to lead the student national salvation movement to the right track. After receiving the order, the Commander-in-Chief of the First Group Army began organizing the teams and decided to set up a general headquarters at Sun Yat-sen University with an attached first battalion headquarters, a second battalion headquarters at Guangya Middle School, and a first third battalion headquarters at Municipal Second Middle School. He also appointed Li Shuzong, Commander of the Military Police, to concurrently serve as the Commander-in-Chief of the National Salvation Volunteer Army, Hua Zhong to concurrently serve as the Commander of the First Battalion, Yao Hanjie to concurrently serve as the Commander of the Second Battalion, and Ruan Baohong to concurrently serve as the Commander of the Third Battalion. Li Shuzong and others took office after receiving the order on the 11th. From this, it can be seen that the demonstration movement of Guangzhou students has gradually shifted from passionate blind action to disciplined practical work.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Robbers Injure Merchants with Knives on the Road</h3>
<p>At the end of the year in the former county, heavy rains led to a significant reduction in the harvest of rural accounts. On the 23rd night, Shi Yunfei, an apprentice at the Dongmen Gongda Rice Shop, and worker Xu Sigen went to the South Gate to collect accounts. The money collected along the way was hidden on the apprentice's person. While passing through the Wangxian Bridge, two robbers suddenly appeared, speaking with a Hakka accent, and blocked their way. Shi Yunfei immediately dodged to the side, and Xu Sigen shouted for help. Seeing that things were not going well, the robbers angrily drew out sharp knives and stabbed Xu Sigen twice. Fortunately, neither strike was fatal. He was sent to Ruose Hospital for treatment and reported to the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: General Inspection of Opium Offenders in Urban and Rural Areas</h3>
<p>The general inspection of opium offenders in Suzhou's urban and rural areas is about to begin, and the province will send personnel to Suzhou to supervise the process. The method will start with the reorganization of Baojia (household registration system), which is currently being rechecked. Starting on the 5th of next month, spot checks will begin, with 46 spot check personnel dispatched (6 from the county government, 2 from the county party headquarters, 20 from the Public Security Bureau, 4 from the Security Team Headquarters, and 14 from the Education Bureau and People's Education Museum). Half of all Baojia numbers will be spot-checked, totaling 12,139 Jia (units of ten households) and 60,659 households. The checks must be completed within one week, and then the general inspection of opium offenders will be carried out.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Merchants Struggling to Pass the Old Lunar New Year</h3>
<p>Business was sluggish last year, and it was extremely difficult to close the Old Lunar New Year. Starting at dawn on New Year's Eve, there was a sudden heavy snowfall, making it difficult for merchants to collect debts. The heavy snow stopped in the afternoon, which benefited the merchants. On New Year's Day, it snowed heavily all day, and there were few pedestrians on the streets, which greatly affected amusement venues. Small vendors in Chong'an Temple in the city were unable to operate and complained bitterly. On the 26th, the weather cleared, but the accumulated snow on the roads had not melted, restoring the appearance of the Old Lunar New Year. Merchants must open for business on the fifth day of the New Year.</p>
<h3>Pinghu: Wanted Fugitive from Minsheng Cotton Mill</h3>
<p>Yu Botang, an employee of the Minsheng Cotton Weaving Factory in Qingyangdi in the city, was assigned to work at the general office in Shanghai. Recently, he suddenly changed his normal behavior and indulged in gambling every day. A few days ago, he stole goods worth more than 2,000 yuan and fled. Yesterday, the Shanghai French Concession police arrested three accomplices, Lan Shuming, Du Jingshan, and Tang Hourong, but Yu alone escaped. After receiving the report, the Public Security Section of this county has strictly ordered its subordinates to issue a warrant for his arrest.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Nanping Section to Start Construction Early Next Month</h3>
<p>The Yunan Section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway held a traffic opening ceremony on the 15th of this month and officially opened for business on the 18th. The groundbreaking ceremony for the Nanping Section was also held on the same day as the opening ceremony, and Wu Xiang, the Chief of the Engineering Section of the Railway Bureau, was appointed as the Director of the Engineering Office, responsible for preparing for the construction work. It was originally planned to start construction at the end of the month, but due to lack of time, it was decided to postpone it to the beginning of next month. In addition, Hou Jiayuan, Deputy Director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and Wu Jingqing, a technician from the Ministry of Railways, were ordered to go to the Guangdong-Hankou Railway to inspect and supervise the Zhushao Section project. They returned to Zhejiang yesterday. According to them, the track-laying project of the Zhushao Section only lacks the section from Hengzhou to Shiping. There are still three major bridge projects on the Hengzhou-Zhuzhou-Guangdong border that must be completed by the end of May before the entire line can be opened to traffic.</p>
<h3>Rural Life Essays: Land Relations and Agricultural Management in Lingjiaqiao, Hang County Continued from the 20th</h3>
<p>By Guo Renquan</p>
<p>Many large landlords in the urban area have divided a large amount of land into very small pieces and rented it to the small farmers in this village. Villagers in this village who have more than 30 mu of land also rent out a part or most of their land to the small farmers in this village. Generally speaking, the cultivated area of ​​the farmers in this village is very small. There are two or three tenant farmers who cultivate more than 30 mu of farmland, but they are forced to do so because of a large population and surplus labor. They do not hire farm laborers in large numbers and do not have any capitalist meaning. Ordinary farmers (tenant farmers) cultivate less than ten mu of land.</p>
<p>Cultivation techniques are very backward in all aspects. Not only have water pumps or newer rice threshers and new-style fences never been seen in this village, but even the use of plowing cattle to drain water is also very rare, and it is decreasing year by year. Here, rice fields are generally drained by human power, because the river channel is very shallow, as long as two or three people work together, they can use a water trough about ten feet long to draw water from the river channel. Partnering in water draining is extremely common in other places where manpower is used to drain water, but here there is not even this need.</p>
<p>Poverty has forced them to sell their plowing cattle. Although water draining can be replaced by manpower, plowing the land (turning the soil) cannot be done without cattle power. Therefore, every year in early June in the Gregorian calendar, when preparing to turn the soil and plant rice, guest cattle specially for turning the soil for local farmers come in response to the season. There are 2,000 mu of rice fields in this village. It is estimated that guest cattle are used to turn the soil in 70% of them. These guest cattle mostly come from neighboring counties such as Xiaoshan, Fuyang, and Zhuji, with the most coming from Zhuji. Some of them first plant early rice in their hometown and then come here, and after returning, they plant late rice (Fuyang, Zhuji); some come here to plow the land first, and after plowing, they return to start cultivating their own rice. Each cow is accompanied by two people, an adult who plows the land with a plow, and a shepherd boy who cuts grass to feed the cow. The plows for plowing the land are also brought by them. They stay in this village for ten to twenty days. Each person borrows accommodation from certain households every year. When the plowing is finished and they are about to leave, they usually invite a Bodhisattva at the house where they are staying and pay one yuan in rent. The wage for plowing each mu of land was three corners and three cents five years ago, it has risen to four corners and five cents in the past five years, but this year it has dropped to four corners due to the low price of grain. In addition, the two people's meals must be provided by the host. It is said that the use of guest cattle for plowing in this village is only a recent thing within the last ten years; in the past, they mostly borrowed cattle from this village, because at that time, farmers did not pay as much attention to the planting of tea trees as they do now, and they could have a longer time to plant rice (40 days in the past, now reduced to 30 days). The plowing cattle in this village were used by each household in turn for a longer period of time, and it was quite sufficient. Therefore, wealthy farmers in the area raised cattle to plow land for others to make a small profit. The situation is very different now.</p>
<p>In the past six or seven years, the price of tea has been very good, which has diverted the farmers' attention to money, and they have all turned their heads to work hard to develop tea plantations. The entire labor of planting tea, except for cultivation, fertilization, and pruning, is extremely busy in the spring when picking "head tea." Picking head tea is usually before the Grain Rain solar term. At this time, local farmers suddenly need a lot of female tea pickers. Because almost every household in this village grows tea, there are no female workers to hire. Therefore, large numbers of female tea pickers from Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Zhuji, Dongyang, and other places came in response to the season, with the most coming from Xiaoshan (80 people) and Dongyang (20 people). Every year they came in hordes on about the same day, in two or three days. They each had their own old employers, who had determined the number of people to be hired in advance after picking tea the previous year, and they knew exactly how many people would come the following year. They stayed in this village for 40 days, living in the employer's house and eating the employer's food. Wages are calculated by the companion. In the past five years, each catty of fresh leaves picked has been worth 100 cash, while five years ago it was 60-80 cash, and ten years ago it was only 32 cash. Because these female workers are paid by the companion and are provided with meals, their calculations are very good. Among every four or five people, there is often one who only knows how to eat and does not know how to pick tea, mixing in with the others. The ages of these female workers range from ten to fifty years old. Those who pick fast can pick five or six catties a day, and those who pick slow can pick three or four catties. During the 40-day period, each person can earn an average of four yuan in wages and take it home.</p>
<p>If the tea market has a very promising future in the long run, then the planting of tea trees is likely to develop in the direction of capitalism. There is a wealthy farmer surnamed Li in this village who has rented 32 mu of tea land every year in the past five or six years, paying 200 yuan in rent. Just the wages of the female tea pickers alone require paying 160 yuan. The two short-term workers who make tea also require 24 yuan.</p>
<p>The author will conduct a detailed investigation on the technical development of tea tree cultivation and tea making in the future.</p>

<h3>Exchange of Silver for Legal Tender is Limited to Remote Areas and the Deadline is Extended</h3>
<p>Regarding the previous report on the extension of the deadline for the exchange of silver for legal tender for three months, a responsible source stated that the so-called extension is limited to remote areas. Because banks have not yet been widely established in the interior, it is not possible to supply a large amount of legal tender in a short period of time, so the people holding a small amount of silver have no way to exchange it on schedule. Based on this special situation, the above-mentioned accommodation measures are temporarily set. The Ministry of Finance issued an order in November last year, originally stipulating that remote provinces and cities would be temporarily allowed to use silver for three months. Now that the deadline has expired, the silver held by the people still needs to be collected and exchanged. The extension is based on the previous order to continue processing.</p>

<h3>Various Solicitation Teams of the Aviation Association; Enthusiastically Pay Membership Fees and Donations; Measures for Collecting Aviation Donation Emblems from Restaurants Have Been Approved</h3>

<h3>The Air Association Headquarters Office; 43rd Office Affairs Meeting; Aviation Exhibition Opened in Shanghai North District Yesterday</h3>

Chairman Li Dachao reported that the solicitation work of the various solicitation teams, except for those that have been completed, is still being actively carried out by some team leaders, deputy team leaders, and team members. Field secretaries should work hard to assist in the activities to improve the results. The collection of aviation funds from dance halls has been formally implemented since the change of method on the 5th of this month, which has been warmly supported by the dance halls and the generous donations from all walks of life, and the results are excellent. All entertainment venues in the city publicize aviation to save the country and solicit aviation funding. Each venue estimates that there are 20,000 to 30,000 visitors every day, so its future power is extremely great. The results of the hotel aviation funding project are increasing day by day. However, due to the sluggish market and poor business conditions, the donations have not yet reached half of the quota. In order to achieve the original intention, and in accordance with the regulations, it should continue to be carried out. Notices have been issued to various hotels so that everyone knows. As for the item of boiled water, which is a daily necessity for the people, in order to promote and collect at the same time, Li Shengxian, Chairman of the Industry Association, has been specially appointed as the team leader of the 449th Solicitation Team, and He Qichang, Bian Hesheng and other thirty-one people as the deputy team leaders to engage in planning and collecting aviation funds.

In addition, the Shanghai West District Aviation to Save the Country Mobile Simple Exhibition has been closed on the 10th of this month, which has been recorded in previous reports.

<h3>Director of the Finance Department of the Ministry of Railways; Chen Yaozu Submitted His Resignation; Resignation Was Determined and He Has Come to Shanghai for Recuperation</h3>

Recently, Chen's insomnia has worsened day by day, and doctors have repeatedly told him that it will not be easy to recover unless he quickly takes a rest and recuperates.

<h3>Two Charity Organizations' Report on Relief Efforts in Zhongxiang</h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Joint Relief Committee on Renji Road, along with the Red Swastika Society, have been jointly managing relief efforts in the Yangtze River region for several months. Relief efforts in Hanyang and Hanchuan counties have already concluded, and the Zhongxiang relief efforts have also come to an end. We have received a letter from the Hankou office of the aforementioned committee reporting on the situation of the relief efforts in Zhongxiang, and we are recording it as follows: The Zhongxiang relief efforts have concluded, benefiting a total of four districts. Districts one and six together comprised 178 Bao (units), 11,849 households, with 31,762 adults and 13,730 children. A total of 20,000 yuan was distributed in relief funds, with 5 jiao (0.5 yuan) per adult and 3 jiao per child. Districts two and nine together comprised 216 Bao, 12,258 households, with a total of 45,349 adults and children. 4,534 shi and 9 dou of broad beans were distributed, with one dou per person, regardless of age. In addition, 5,945 items of clothing and 5,800 doses of various medicines were distributed. However, due to the accumulation of several feet of sand in various places, it was impossible to sow seeds. Once the cold season passes, there will be widespread famine in the spring, and more than 100,000 disaster-stricken people will still not be able to avoid dying in ditches. We urgently hope that benevolent people and gentlemen at home and abroad will work together to find a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>Furthermore, news has been received that Mr. Yu Jiashen, the relief commissioner of the Chinese and Foreign Joint Relief Committee, inspected the disaster situation in Yichang and Jiangling counties. In Yichang, 42,500 mu of farmland were affected, 14,689 houses were destroyed, and the number of disaster victims was 110,251. In Jiangling County, more than 1.6 million mu of farmland were affected, 56,560 houses were destroyed, and the number of disaster victims was more than 350,000. The total number of disaster victims in the above two counties is more than 460,000. The severity of the disaster is no different from that in Zhongxiang. The counties had previously decided to dispatch relief teams one and two from the Red Swastika Society to be responsible for investigation and distribution in different areas. However, the previously allocated relief fund of 20,000 yuan has already been distributed. Although the Chinese and Foreign Joint Relief Committee has continued to allocate 4,000 yuan and 2,000 sets of cotton clothing, and the Red Swastika Society has allocated 3,200 yuan, it is actually not enough to distribute. We urgently hope that all great philanthropists will express their great wishes and save these disaster-stricken people who are dying in the freezing cold. The merit will be immeasurable.</p>

The Central Government specially dispatched Judicial Yuan President Ju Zheng, Central Party Department Secretary General Ye Chucang, and Central Committee Member Chen Ce to Hong Kong to welcome him. Ju and others originally planned to travel north with Mr. Hu, but it has now been learned that Mr. Hu decided to stay in Hong Kong for a while to rest due to the fatigue of the journey and to go to Guangdong to handle everything. However, Ju, Ye, and others, due to the urgent need to deal with government affairs in the capital, left Hong Kong on the morning of the 25th aboard the Coolidge President of the Da Lai Company and returned north.

<h3>Shanghai General History Museum Proceeds with Compilation; The Second Shanghai Municipal Yearbook; Planned to be Divided into 24 Sections, Focusing on Evolution and Statistics; All Institutions and Public Associations are Welcome to Provide Materials</h3>
<p>This city is the center of national economics and culture. In recent years, the municipal government has followed the Premier’s Great Shanghai Plan and has worked hard to construct it, and the progress is particularly rapid. The current statistical situation and historical evolution can all be used as a reference for administration and scholarship. These two tasks are undertaken by the Shanghai General History Museum. Last year, the museum already published the first Shanghai Municipal Yearbook. The entire book contains two million words, collected historical materials, arranged facts, and is precise and rich. Several famous scholars called it a powerful work that made up for the cultural shortcomings of Shanghai in the past century. Its value can be known. The museum has now decided to compile the 1936 Shanghai Municipal Yearbook. The proposed plan has been approved by the Municipal Government, and the Shanghai Municipal Yearbook Committee will be organized to compile it in accordance with last year's method. This year’s yearbook is divided into special articles, a summary of major events, land and population, weather and climate, party affairs, administration, justice, diplomacy, military affairs, finance, banking, education, transportation, industry, labor, commerce, agriculture, forestry and fisheries administration, academics, religion, social undertakings, the First Special District, the Second Special District, a diary of current events, and a reference section, totaling twenty-four sections. The content is mainly statistical tables, supplemented by text. All statistical tables are based on the most recent and latest publications. Each section has a history item, so as to show the traces of the development of the industry. As for the source of information, in addition to collecting it from the Municipal Government and various agencies and receiving enthusiastic assistance, the museum also welcomes all legal entities, industry associations, and major stores to provide business statistics and historical evolution to enrich the content.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal National Goods Association Plans to Form an Investigation and Observation Group</h3>
<p>Chen Jiufeng, Director of the Investigation Section of the Shanghai Municipal National Goods Movement Association, yesterday sent a letter to the association suggesting the establishment of a national goods investigation and observation group to promote production efficiency. The original letter stated, "To whom it may concern, the concept of using national goods to save the country is already familiar to everyone. To increase production, we must first improve technology, but without statistics, it is still like scattered sand. Therefore, the national goods movement has been around for several years, and except for superficial propaganda work, there is no actual benefit. This association will name this year as 'Shanghai Municipal National Goods Year'. Time flies quickly, and the lessons of the past should not be ignored. We must seek achievements to be worthy of the people. As far as Jiufeng can see, I suggest that this association organize a 'National Goods Investigation and Observation Group' to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Start with investigation, investigate the equipment of factories, the quality of products, the structure of machines, the composition of raw materials, the work system rate, distinguish between good and bad, and submit for awards and protection, or declare on behalf of them, to awaken producers to compete for improvement, so that national goods have a bright future. At the same time, it enables aspiring entrepreneurs to conduct on-site inspections, the distribution of components, the dissection of ingredients, the principles of chemistry, the management of engineering, and the manufacturing methods, to understand everything, create industrial talents, and seek technical cooperation. It can also make the bourgeoisie happy to invest and develop industries, so that national goods can not only be popularized throughout the country, but also be sold to the world. If it can be systematically organized, it seems to be more effective. The establishment of the Shanghai Municipal National Goods Year will achieve practical results. I have attached a copy of the organizational outline and an investigation form, hoping that you will submit them to the meeting for discussion, so as to improve technology and increase production. It is the responsibility of this association to do its best."</p>
<h3>Health Bureau Responds to National Medical Association, Explaining Questions About License Renewal</h3>
<p>Since the Health Bureau of the Republic of China examined the business licenses of physicians in this city this year, and issued three new renewal methods, the National Medical Association of China had four questions that it could not understand, and specifically requested the Health Bureau to explain them. Now it has received reply No. 14456 from the Health Bureau, with detailed explanations. The original text is recorded as follows: "Both letters have been received. In addition to sending 500 copies of the registration form for this year's license, please check and use them. Now, I will answer the questions in the letter separately as follows: 1. The registration license for physicians in this city is issued based on the Provisional Regulations for the Management of Physicians in this city. The aforementioned regulations do not stipulate that physicians who practice outside this city must also register in this city. Therefore, anyone who has registered with this bureau in accordance with the aforementioned regulations has already proved that they are practicing medicine within the area of this city. This is very clear. If it is said that after registration, due to personnel changes, the location is moved, or moved to another city, then you can follow the provisions of Article 16 of the regulations and report to the bureau, then the address can be easily checked, and communication will be convenient. Therefore, the first two points in your association's letter that 'external members cannot be notified' and that counties outside the urban area of this city submit registration licenses of this city to the province for registration, are not reasonable in principle, and are also in conflict with the regulations of this city. It is really impossible to verify. 2. The third point in your letter, regarding the fine for overdue license renewal, should be calculated from the year the amendment regulations (24th year of the Republic of China). 3. The fourth point in your letter, regarding Article 14 of the regulations for overdue license renewal, 'a fine of not more than five yuan will be imposed'. The fine for one overdue should be based on five yuan as the standard. However, this bureau may check the situation and deal with it at its discretion. Also, this fine should be paid to the bureau along with the license for processing. The license renewal methods stipulated this year are all for the convenience of investigation and rectification. I hope that your association will inform all members and abide by them together." After receiving the reply, the association has been actively processing it.</p>
<h3>Taifeng Food Company Postpones Resumption of Business to the 12th of Next Month</h3>
<p>Taifeng Canned Food Company, which is actively preparing to resume business, immediately repaired the machinery in the factory and renovated the retail department on Nanjing Road after the new shareholders successively paid their shares. It was originally scheduled to resume business on the 30th of this month, but because the parts for the machinery in the factory need to be reconfigured, it is not possible to prepare them all at once. Therefore, it has now been postponed to the 12th of next month for the opening.</p>
<h3>DeMark Forbids Mailing Back to Germany</h3>

<h3>Winner of Invincible Brand Thousand Yuan Prize - Xu Wentian of Lanzhou, Gansu</h3>
<p>Household Industrial Society produces Butterfly Cream and潔白 [clean white] toothpaste, with a lottery ticket attached, divided into one yuan, five yuan, fifty yuan, and one thousand yuan, and the most can get a price of two thousand yuan. The product sells very widely, so lottery tickets have also been found repeatedly. Recently, a thousand yuan prize was also found in Lanzhou, Gansu. According to the general manager of the company in North China, Mingyi Store in Lanzhou batched five dozen Butterfly Cream, including a thousand yuan lottery ticket. The Household Industrial Society entrusted the Central Bank to remit 1,000 yuan in legal currency, which was received by Mr. Xu Wenyuan of Huaian Store, Nanguan Street, Lanzhou. Because the Butterfly Cream toothpaste of the company is sold within the customs, it has been popular, and it is the first time that a huge prize has been obtained in a remote area. Therefore, it is proposed to request the winner to send a small photo to be published in the newspaper, so as to arouse the interest of all those who love to use national goods.</p>

<h3>During the Lunar New Year, the Exchange Rate of Copper Coins Rose</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance implemented legal currency, the exchange rate was uniform, with 300 copper coins per yuan and 12 jiao per small foreign coin. Although some small money changers and tobacco shops have reduced the exchange rate to 120 wen per yuan, since the Lunar New Year's Eve, it has suddenly been greatly reduced. Exchanging one yuan of legal currency, the exchange rate is only 2,780 to 2,890 wen, the small foreign coin is 10 jiao and 180 to 190 wen, and the double毫 [small denomination currency] is exchanged for 470 to 480 wen. During these three days of rest, exchanging one yuan of legal currency is actually a loss of more than 200 wen.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Mayor Ma Chaojun's Home in Shanghai Burglarized; Arrest and Interception Recovered Stolen Goods</h3>
<p>The 洋房 [Western-style house] at No. 182 Jufu Road, French Concession, is the residence of the current Nanjing Mayor Ma Chaojun. On the morning of the 20th of this month at about 4 o'clock, burglars Zhu Rongbao, Xu Jingui, Xu Juesheng, etc., and four accomplices who are at large, climbed over the wall and broke into the garden, pried open the glass window and door, sneaked into the hall and upstairs inner rooms, and stole antiques such as擺式 [display-style] jadeite jade ornaments and jade stones worth more than a thousand gold, as well as silverware and foreign wine for food and drink, and dozens of yuan in cash and several pieces of clothing. They escaped with the stolen goods and went to the intersection of Fuxi Road and 20th East Road, where they happened to meet French patrol room detectives Zhou Ruzhang, detective Li Baochang, and Zhou Diqing on patrol. They saw Zhu and two others walking ahead, their demeanor was suspicious, and they immediately stopped Zhu and others for a search, and found the stolen goods. After interrogation, they confessed to stealing them. An accomplice had escaped in the meantime, so they took Zhu and others along with the stolen goods to the patrol room. At the same time, they notified Mr. Ma's residence, filled out a detailed lost list, and in the afternoon of the same day, they sent Zhu and others to the Criminal Court One of the Second Special District Court. Judge Wang Gang interrogated them, because the police department lawyer requested a postponement of the investigation before prosecuting. The detectives in charge reported the process of breaking the case against the defendants and presented the stolen goods. The court核准 [ratified/approved], after briefly questioning the defendants, ordered that the postponement be granted for one week, and the matter will be investigated again. The defendants were detained.</p>
<h3>Mi Jingshen's Lawsuit Against Huang Xianyao Has Hope for Settlement; Huang Claims Mi is Not Involved in the Forged Evidence Case</h3>
<p>Mi Jingshen, a Hangzhou native who used to be a lawyer, was previously sued in the Second Special District Court for forgery in a promissory note dispute of 100,000 yuan by Huang Xianyao, the second son of the late Huang Chu Jiu. Huang claimed that this promissory note was forged by Mi and Wu Jiajin, believing that Huang Xianyao deliberately妨害 [obstructed] his reputation, so he hired lawyers Wang Shizong and Yin Shouguang to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court to sue Huang Xianyao for defamation, requesting that he be investigated according to law. The case has been reported in this newspaper that Judge Qiu Huan Ying has repeatedly opened court sessions to summon him, and Huang has failed to appear in court due to illness. On the 22nd, another court session was held. The defendant Huang Xianyao came to court with his defense lawyer. The plaintiff Mi Jingshen was represented by his attorney. It was claimed that this case had hope for settlement, but the specific details had not been agreed upon, and a postponement was requested. The court asked Huang Xianyao whether he participated in the joint forgery of this 100,000 yuan promissory note. Huang claimed that this promissory note was given to Mi Jingshen by Wu Jiajin, a lawyer's runner. I did not directly give the promissory note to Mi. When I initially applied to the local court for mediation, I had not yet seen this promissory note. Later, Mi knew that this promissory note was forged, so he did not proceed with the formal lawsuit. Mi did not actually participate in the forgery of the promissory note. It was Wu Jiajin who caused a dispute. The court核供 [verified the confession] and ordered both parties to quickly submit a petition to this court to withdraw the lawsuit if a settlement could be reached outside the court. If no settlement could be reached, they would wait for another summons on a scheduled date.</p>
<h3>Plum Blossom Pole Flashes in the Pan; Great Shanghai Garden Accuses of Chasing Losses; Continued Hearing This Afternoon</h3>
<p>In August of the year before last, Zhang Xuebin, who claimed to be a famous master of the Lingji Orthodox Sect of Shaolin Temple from Mount Emei in Sichuan, was introduced and guaranteed by Shen Huating and Sun Lie, who lived at No. 13 Xinmin Lane, Buerbu Road, French Concession, and signed a contract with Feng Yixiang, manager of the Great Shanghai Garden at No. 543 Haig Road, to perform amazing skills such as the plum blossom pole擂台 [platform] and Gecko work in the Great Shanghai Garden. The surplus from ticket sales, after deducting expenses, would be divided equally between the two parties. After the contract was signed, the Great Shanghai Garden刊登 [published] advertisements in various newspapers in this city to promote the event, causing a sensation for a time. People in Shanghai only saw these techniques in novels. Once a real special discovery was made, they all rushed to buy tickets in order to feast their eyes. Who knew that when Zhang Xuebin took the stage on October 17, he was greatly disappointed. The audience shouted that they had been deceived. Zhang then lost his courage and did not take the stage again. The Great Shanghai Garden suffered losses due to the advertising costs and borrowed money given to Zhang in advance. Manager Feng Yixiang negotiated compensation with the original introducers and guarantors, Shen Huating and Sun Lie, but could not resolve the issue for a long time. Moreover, Zhang's whereabouts were uncertain. The introducer Shen Huating was perfunctory, while Sun Lie's whereabouts were unknown. The matter was delayed until now, for more than a year. Recently, Feng Yixiang, manager of the Great Shanghai Garden, hired lawyer Wu Peng to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the Second Special District against Zhang Xuebin, Shen Huating, and Sun Lie, requesting that Zhang, Shen, and Sun be jointly ordered to compensate for losses of 11,097 yuan, 3 jiao and 3 fen in national currency, as well as a loan of 1,900 yuan and an annual interest rate of 5% from November 1, 1934 until the end of the execution, and litigation costs. The court approved the petition and summoned the defendants Zhang Xuebin, Shen Huating, and Sun Lie to court on the 20th of this month at 11:00 am by Judge Wu Xiaoke in Civil Court Seven. None of the defendants appeared in court. The plaintiff Feng Yixiang, represented by his attorney Wu Peng, stated that the defendants had not been served with summons and requested the court to allow public service. Judge Wu核词 [reviewed the statement] and ordered another summons to be issued for a hearing on the 27th (today). If the defendants still fail to appear, public service will be made again.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Injury in Zhoujiadu, Pudong</h3>
<p>At about 10:00 pm on the 22nd of this month, six robbers, speaking the 客家 [Hakka] dialect, suddenly came to the Xiexing South Goods Store opened by local Zhang Shifu at No. 10 Xicun, Zhoujiadu, Pudong. They had a pistol and a small knife and threatened the store to rob it. Because the shop assistant resisted, the robbers fired a gun and wounded the shop assistant Zhu Renying in the right hand. The bullet did not come out, and the shop assistant Zhuang Li Hou was stabbed in the left eye with a knife. They robbed about a hundred yuan in banknotes and fled through the door. The shop owner's wife, Zhu, went out to call for help to catch the robbers, and was hit in the head by the robbers with a wooden stick, causing serious injuries. The family immediately sent the injured people to Shanghai Hospital for treatment, and reported to the police station to arrest the robbers according to law.</p>

After the case, the detective from the 山捕房 [Shanghai Municipal Council Police Station] apprehended Li and Wu and sent them to the First Special District Court. The plaintiff Xu Jiaxiang proved that the brothers were at the scene of the robbery at the time. The工部局 [Shanghai Municipal Council] lawyer Zhang Shizhu requested severe judgment.

They袖出 [pulled out] a fake pistol and threatened him to keep silent. Seeing that the呢 [woolen] overcoat he was wearing was valuable, they stripped it off and fled in different directions. Shao reported the situation to the Yangshupu patrol room under his jurisdiction. The patrol chief sent detective Li Xiucheng to investigate and arrested Mao and the other three at No. 52 Zhoujiapai Road and took them into custody at the patrol room. The next morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court Three of the First Special District Court. 工部局 [Shanghai Municipal Council] lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated the case and said that the defendants denied it in the patrol room and that the stolen goods had not been retrieved. He asked for a postponement for a detailed investigation. Then, Detective Ji stated the circumstances of the arrest. Questioning Mao Jinfu and others, their供词 [confessions] were evasive. The推事 [judge] ordered that they still be detained and that the matter be verified again on another date.</p>
<h3>Bathroom Attendants Dropping Dragon Lanterns Fined Two Yuan Each</h3>
<p>The堂倌 [attendants] of a certain bathroom on Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, raised funds every Lunar New Year to make colorful dragon lanterns and beat gongs and drums loudly. For five days, from New Year's Day to the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, they went to the gates of major mansions and商号 [businesses] to drop dragon lanterns and beg for tips, as was their custom. This Lunar New Year, they also raised funds to make a colorful dragon with thirteen sections. At about 8:00 pm the night before last, they carried it to the front of the Rixinchi Bathroom on Weimar Road, French Concession, and dropped it hard, with loud gongs and drums. Pedestrians gathered to watch the热闹 [lively activity], with crowds of people blocking traffic. The巡捕房 [police station] on Songshan Road was nearby, and after learning of the situation, immediately dispatched Central Vietnam detectives to drive them away. However, there were so many spectators that it was not easy to disperse them for a while. After about half an hour, in addition to dispersing the spectators, they took the four leaders and the dragon lantern, gongs and drums to the patrol room. The patrol chief ordered them to be fined two yuan each and released them.</p>
<h3>Robbers Claim to be Delivering Gifts Before Robbing</h3>

On the spot, they showed pistols and threatened the victims. As a result, they robbed jewelry, clothes, and banknotes worth more than 300 yuan in foreign currency. After robbing, the robbers fled without a trace. The victims then reported to the老闸 [old gate] patrol room for investigation.</p>

<h3>The Good Companion Publishing Company Establishes a Five Hundred Yuan Literary Prize</h3>
<p>Literary prizes are held annually in foreign literary circles. However, in China, since the one and only trial run of a social essay prize ten years ago, there has been no further attempt to continue this practice. It is now learned that the Shanghai Good Companion Publishing Company, in commemoration of the continued publication of the "Good Companion Literary Collection, Volume Two," has specially established a five hundred yuan prize to solicit original full-length novels. Five well-known writers have been appointed as judges. In recent years, the Good Companion Company has published many books on literature and art. The "Great Series of Philosophical and Literary Works" published last year received high praise from the press. Following the recent major restructuring within the company, Yu Hansheng has been appointed as manager. Significant reforms are underway regarding business policies and publishing plans. The "Good Companion Pictorial," published by the company, has particularly rich content in its annual issues and is about to be published.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors of the Co-operative Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Co-operative Association held its twenty-ninth joint meeting of directors and supervisors the day before yesterday. More than thirty people, including Wei Ming, attended. Yang Wendao chaired the meeting, and Shi Guang served as recorder. The meeting proceeded as usual. The chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating in brief that the association, since its enthusiastic organization by comrades, has been in existence for over a year. It has made diligent efforts in all aspects of social welfare, implementing the spirit of mutual assistance and jointly seeking social well-being. He expressed reliance on the collective efforts of the members to serve society and ensure the implementation of mutual support. He then requested the heads of each department to report on the achievements of the past year in 1935, so that all members would be fully informed.</p>
<p>(A) Reporting Items:</p>
<p>* The Organization Department reported that 282 new members had joined in the past year, including eight who went abroad to do business, thirty-two who returned to their hometowns, and three who passed away.</p>
<p>* The Finance Department reported on the income and expenditure of the past year. According to Article 13 of the regulations, congratulations were given to nine members who had sons or daughters.

<p>* The Medical Department reported the issuance of aid to the poor and sick for the past year.</p>
<p>* The Training Department reported that the association originally intended to open a free school to provide relief for out-of-school children. However, due to the economic downturn, the school's operating expenses could not be raised. Furthermore, the number of out-of-school children seeking relief has increased daily due to the impact of the downturn. The Education Section submitted a petition to the Standing Committee, hoping to find ways to address the expectations of those seeking relief as soon as possible. It was later resolved to expedite the establishment of a free night school. Over fifty male and female children have enrolled, and the school's performance is quite good.</p>

<h3>Reasons for Train Delays on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway</h3>
<p>Since the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway shortened train travel times and revised train schedules, travelers have found it very convenient. However, recently, passenger trains on the Beijing-Shanghai line have occasionally failed to arrive on time. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited a responsible person at the railway administration yesterday to inquire about the reasons. According to the official, the railway shortened travel times for the convenience of most travelers. In the initial period, all trains were able to arrive on time. However, recently, delays have occurred on the Beijing-Shanghai passenger trains. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>* Due to business needs, the railway has added large locomotives. Before these locomotives can be put into operation, efforts are being made to strengthen the bridge foundations and tracks along the route to ensure safety. As a result, trains must reduce their speed when passing through construction sites, which affects the overall travel time.</p>
<p>* The weather is cold, the tracks are slippery, and snow falls frequently along the route. The strong winds are unfavorable for train travel, causing trains to fail to adhere to the scheduled times.</p>
<p>* It is the end of the lunar year, and travelers are crowded. As a result, the number of cars attached to the train exceeds the prescribed engine power. In addition, passengers and luggage are constantly getting on and off at each station, which takes more time, making the original stop time insufficient.</p>
<p>The above three points are unavoidable in practice. However, for the sake of rectification, relevant departments have been instructed to make every effort to remedy the situation within their power, in order to maintain the punctuality of train travel and fulfill the original intention of convenience for passengers.</p>
<h3>Yu Rizhang Passes Away at the Age of Fifty-Four, Leaving Behind Four Sons and Three Daughters</h3>
<p>Dr. Yu Rizhang, former General Secretary of the National Association of the Young Men's Christian Association of China, returned to China for medical treatment after contracting an illness in the United States two years ago. He never fully recovered, and his condition recently deteriorated. He passed away at his residence on Yuyuan Road at 8:00 PM on the 22nd, at the age of fifty-four. The funeral service will be held at St. Peter's Church on Edinburgh Road at 2:00 PM on Saturday, the 25th, followed by interment at the Anglican Cemetery in Tanjiaqiao, Zhabei. Dr. Yu was the eldest son of Mr. Yu Wenqing, an Anglican pastor in Hubei (Mr. Wenqing is still alive). He was born in Wuchang in the eighth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. He graduated from Wenhua College in Wuchang, St. John's University in Shanghai, and Harvard University in the United States, earning a Master of Education degree. After returning to China, he taught at Wenhua College and later served as its president. During the Xinhai Revolution, he served as a negotiator for Hubei Province. In the first year of the Republic, he served as secretary to Vice President Li Yuanhong. Later, at the invitation of the National YMCA, he served as the Director of the Intellectual Education Department, dedicating himself to the promotion of social education. Dr. Wang Rutang was the General Secretary of the YMCA at the time. When Dr. Wang went to Beijing to serve as Vice Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dr. Yu succeeded him as General Secretary of the YMCA. From then on, he abandoned his ambition for officialdom and devoted himself to the YMCA for over twenty years. He resigned last year due to illness. In addition to his service at the YMCA, Dr. Yu also devoted himself to social movements. During the Washington Conference, he and Dr. Jiang Menglin were elected as representatives for public diplomacy, attending the conference and giving speeches to various American organizations, changing international public opinion. China's diplomacy was ultimately successful. Dr. Yu also founded the Pacific International Institute with non-governmental leaders from Pacific countries to promote understanding and friendship among the nations of the Pacific. In the twelfth year of the Republic, the National Christian Council of China was established, and Dr. Yu was elected as its president. Dr. Yu often traveled to various places to give speeches for the sake of the council, often exhausting himself to the point of hoarseness, which gradually led to heart weakness. In the twenty-first year, he disregarded the doctor's advice and made another trip to the United States. While talking with former US Secretary of State Stimson, he suddenly suffered a stroke. He was treated for several months before returning to China, but the disease had already taken root, and he eventually succumbed to it. It is a pity. Dr. Yu is survived by four sons and three daughters. The eldest son, Xin'en, is currently an intern at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The second son, Xin'an, works for Dala Company. The eldest daughter, Qing Shou, is married to Mr. Huang Renlin, the General Secretary of the Lihzhi Society. The rest are all of school age.</p>
<h3>American Millionaire Mrs. Taylor to Depart Shanghai Soon, Yacht to Remain in Shanghai to Await Her Return</h3>
<p>Mrs. M. B. Taylor, the daughter of the head of Citibank, the American financial magnate, suffers from a medical condition, and doctors have advised her to travel to various countries for treatment. Her father specially allocated a huge sum of money for his daughter's travels, purchasing a world-renowned yacht and bringing along servants to cross the Mediterranean Sea and reach the Far East. Mrs. Taylor admired the scenery of the Yangtze River and the gorges of Sichuan and planned to sail the ship to Chongqing. However, due to the shallow water and the deep draft of the ship, her wish could not be fulfilled. Mrs. Taylor left the ship in Shanghai and went to Sichuan by land. She originally planned to leave Shanghai for Taiwan on the 24th, but due to delays in her itinerary, she will have to postpone her departure by a day or two. The ship will remain in Shanghai to await her return. The latest information is as follows:</p>
<p>Luxurious Yacht: The yacht Mrs. Taylor is traveling on is a sailing and motor vessel named Oolnada, with a displacement of 1,670 tons. It is one of the largest yachts in the world and was purchased by Mrs. Taylor. The equipment inside the ship is superior to that of a 10,000-ton passenger ship, and the anti-theft measures are even more comprehensive. The ship is equipped with a large number of weapons and firearms, and all the sailors on board are able to fight temporarily. Mrs. Taylor put a lot of effort into this before her departure, as her travels do not focus solely on famous cities but also include places where few people have been.</p>
<p>No Visitors in Shanghai: Mrs. Taylor departed from Southampton, England, and is scheduled to travel around the world for 18 months. She first went to Africa, then through the Mediterranean Sea, the Suez Canal, past Ceylon Island, through Southeast Asia, then to Annam, and then to Hong Kong before arriving in Shanghai. Upon Mrs. Taylor's arrival in Shanghai, all import inspections of the ship were handled by a British merchant in Shanghai. The yacht was moored at buoy number six. Before Mrs. Taylor disembarked, the British merchants in Shanghai who came to welcome her were all heads of foreign firms. However, when they tried to board the ship, they were all turned away and not allowed to see her. The sailors who served as guards were even more careful in guarding her bedroom.</p>
<p>Arrival in Sichuan: She originally intended to sail the yacht up the Yangtze River to view the scenery of our new capital, and then follow the route through Hankou, Shashi, and Yichang to reach the Sichuan River and personally admire the Three Gorges. However, things did not go as planned. Mrs. Taylor arrived in Shanghai just as the lunar year was ending and the water level of the river was low, making it difficult for the yacht to navigate upstream. She changed her plans and went to Nanjing by train on the Beijing-Shanghai line, then flew to Chongqing to admire the scenery of the Sichuan Gorges. She will have to wait for another day. Mrs. Taylor is accompanied by three female servants on her travels, while the yacht remains in Shanghai to await her return before setting sail again.</p>
<p>Astonishing Travel Expenses: The expenses for Mrs. Taylor's travels around the world are truly astonishing. The salaries of the yacht's crew alone will cost over 400,000 yuan for 18 months. In addition, the taxes and fees paid by the ship in each place, the local agency fees, and her personal expenses and shopping will amount to no less than 2 million yuan. It is only a wealthy person from a gold-producing country who can afford to buy a ship and spend 2 million yuan to travel the world. She was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai and set sail yesterday, but due to unforeseen circumstances, she had to postpone her departure. However, she will only stay for one or two more days before taking the original ship to Taiwan, crossing the Pacific Ocean to Japan, then to the United States, and then to other places. This is also a special dispatch from Shanghai during the winter vacation.</p>
<h3>Retired British Constable Detained on Suspicion of Counterfeiting, Mills Claims Ignorance of Forged Bills, Treated Comfortably While Detained in Yokohama</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd: Mills, a retired constable from the Shanghai Municipal Police, was detained by the Yokohama Port Police this morning for questioning in connection with the use of counterfeit bills from the Zhongnan Bank. Mills claimed that he was unaware that the bills he possessed were forged. The British Consul in Yokohama is currently paying attention to the matter. Mills was traveling to Canada with his wife and daughters on the Empress of Japan, but was detained by the police as the ship left Yokohama. His wife and daughters have all been released.</p>
<p>Yokohama, 23rd: Mr. Mills, former Western constable of the Shanghai International Settlement, has been accused of using counterfeit banknotes and will be detained at the Yokohama Waterfront Police Station for several days pending investigation of the truth of his crime. After the police station completes its investigation, it will report to the public prosecutor, who will decide whether to prosecute him. At the same time, the British Consulate has sent special food and blankets to Mr. Mills to make him comfortable. Mr. Mills' wife and daughters are currently staying at a local hotel pending the outcome of the case. According to reports, Mr. Mills left Shanghai on the Empress of Japan four days ago and disembarked here yesterday with his family for a short trip when he was arrested by the police. (Reuters)</p>
<h3>Man Brutally Murdered in Sangongtang, Dongjiadu, Corner of Head Chopped Off, Bridge of Nose Broken and Bloody</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 20th of this month, a male corpse was found murdered in the Hutungbang south of Sangongtang in Dongjiadu, Pudong. The deceased was wearing a blue cloth long gown with an interlining inside. He appeared to be in his twenties. A corner of his head had been chopped off with an axe, and the bridge of his nose had also been broken with an axe handle, leaving a bloody mess. The scene was quite gruesome. The next day, the relevant police station ordered the headman Qiu Bangxue to report the case to the court for an official investigation. No family members were found to claim the body, which was ordered to be taken to the charity hall for burial pending the arrest of the murderer.</p>
<h3>Mother and Child Both Dead, Tragic Case of Abandoned Corpses, Done Due to Lack of a Coffin, All Relevant Persons Detained</h3>
<p>Yuan Shunfeng, who works as a rickshaw puller, lives in the Huangbao rickshaw workshop at No. 26 Xiaopi Lane in Nanshi. His wife, Zhu (28 years old), was seven months pregnant and suddenly felt abdominal pain on the evening of the 21st, indicating that she was about to give birth. Yuan was not at home at the time. A neighboring woman, Li Tao, heard about it and went to check, and asked Song Wang, who lived outside No. 26, to hire a midwife to deliver the baby at home. As a result, both Yuan Zhu and the baby girl she delivered died. When her husband Yuan Shunfeng returned home and saw what had happened, he realized that he was destitute and could not afford coffins for his wife and daughter. He then asked his brother Yuan Jiafu to go to the Wanyu dock in Nanshi and discuss with Xu Huangpu, the boss of the Kaitai rickshaw company, about finding coffins. Unexpectedly, Xu said he could not get coffins and advised Yuan to abandon the bodies of his wife and daughter in a remote place to save trouble. Yuan Shunfeng was confused by this. He invited Yang Qigou to help him wrap the bodies of his wife and child in cotton quilts. At around one o'clock in the middle of the night, Yang Qigou used his rickshaw to transport them to a deserted area near the Qinxin Girls' Middle School outside the Dananmen and abandon them. This was discovered by the patrol police of the street police station, who reported it to Chief Jin. Chief Jin immediately ordered the local headman to report the case to the Shanghai Local Court and requested an autopsy. After the autopsy, the court ordered the family to claim the bodies and bury them. After the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's Detective Brigade Chief Ji Yuanpu and Deputy Chief Wang Huibai immediately ordered the Third Detachment Chief Qiu Yifan and Yang Yufu to order team leader Shen Jinchu and Gao Wansheng, to conduct a thorough investigation. Only then did they discover the abandonment of the bodies. On the same day, they dispatched more detectives to arrest Yuan Shunfeng and Yuan Jiafu, brothers, as well as Li Tao, Xu Huangpu, Song Wang, and Song Xueting, Yang Shaowu, Xu Henglin, and other male and female suspects. After interrogation, because the case involved the abandonment of bodies and was inhumane, they were all detained for further investigation to apprehend Yang Qigou, who transported the bodies, and send him to the headquarters for punishment.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xibiao, a Wanted Criminal in the Double Murder Case of Chinese and Russian Detectives Two Years Ago, Arrested, Confronted with a Bandit Sentenced to Life Imprisonment, Second Special Court Scheduled to Hold Trial Today</h3>
<p>On October 15, 1933, Liu Changrui and others, leaders of the Detective Team of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, cracked a robbery case at the Hongda Fresh Meat Shop on Route Sayzofficier in western Shanghai. A bandit named Chen Bingsheng confessed that he had a pistol hidden in the front room of No. 12 Henging Lane, Route Balle in the French Concession. The detectives, led by detectives Gong Lixiang and Chen Liangfu, reported the case to the French Concession police for assistance. Russian detective Mike Zhaolaf and investigator Lu Zhixiang accompanied them to No. 12 Henging Lane, Route Balle. They knocked on the door and entered. The bandits had prepared for the arrival. Seeing the Russian detective and Gong Lixiang, the detective from the Public Security Bureau, leading the way, they opened the door and refused to be arrested with both hands holding a box cannon and a pistol. The Russian detective Mike Zhaolaf was the first to be shot and killed. Lu Zhixiang and Chen Liangfu were also shot in the arms and legs. The bandits who refused to be arrested escaped over the roof. Chen Bingsheng, the bandit they brought along, was frightened and fell from the window of the front room and was injured. As a result, the escaping bandits carried a box cannon and hand pistol, took a rickshaw from Route Balle to the north, and escaped to the intersection of Route LaFayette. They got out of the rickshaw and fled into the bungalow in the dark alley of No. 5 Fengli, Route Lafayette. They squatted high up and resisted with gunfire. The detectives returned fire. The bandit was shot eight times, injured, and fell to the ground. He was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment by the police car. It took two months to recover. He was transferred to the Second Special Court for prosecution according to law. The bandit confessed that his name was Wu Yaoting, also known as Yao Ren, 32 years old, from Shaoxing. He came to Shanghai from Hangzhou that day and stayed at his cousin Zhang Xibiao's place. That night, he went back from the Great World amusement park and met Zhang Xibiao, who handed him the box cannon and pistol and ordered him to escape. He admitted to opening fire and resisting arrest, but he thought that Zhang Xibiao opened fire and killed people. As a result, Wu was sentenced to life imprisonment. A warrant was issued to arrest the fugitive Zhang Xibiao and bring him to justice. This case has been cracked so far, and he has been sent to the First Special Court for questioning and detention. The detective obtained the court's approval from the French Concession police. Judge Xiong Huiping came to the First Criminal Court for interrogation. Because the police department requested a seven-day extension to investigate the case, it was asked to be tried. Zhang Xibiao was questioned and denied opening fire to resist arrest and kill people. The court ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for the 27th (today) to investigate the case again. During the rescheduling, the police department proposed to the Second Special Prison to confront and interrogate the bandit Wu Yaoting, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment. The court will hold a hearing today. The police department often brings charges according to law, and there are detailed interrogation records. The record will be continued tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Case of Female Doctor Canceling Engagement, Fiancé Unable to Be Served, Single-Sided Argument Concluded</h3>
<p>Cai Mary, a female doctor from Pudong at the Renci Obstetrics Hospital at No. 926 the intersection of Route Edward VII and Route Longmen, became engaged on the eighth day of the fourth lunar month of 1934 to Wang Songpo, a fellow villager residing at No. 11 Changyuan Lane, Route Hainan. At that time, Wang claimed to be a graduate of Jinan University and had served as a section chief in the political arena. Five months after the engagement, Wang used the excuse of seeking the position of section chief of the Second Section of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau and borrowed 1,000 yuan from Cai. Wang said he would return it immediately after taking office. Cai did not refuse because of her fiancé's career prospects and tried her best to raise 1,000 yuan for Wang, and they drew up a written agreement as proof. Recently, Cai found out that Wang's actions were all false and that she could not spend her life with him. She hired lawyer Wu Baotai to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court, requesting to cancel the engagement with Wang and return the 1,000 yuan loan. The court once summoned Wang, but because Wang's whereabouts were unknown and his family refused to accept the summons, the court ordered a postponement to summon his parents to court for a retrial. Yesterday, Judge Peng Shi continued the hearing in the Fourth Civil Court. Wang's parents, Wang Ruiqing and Wang Hang, were present in court. According to their testimony, although the engagement between their son and Cai was arranged by them, it was also with the consent of both parties. They were not informed of the loan beforehand, and after their son went out, he never returned. Cai came to them to demand the money, but they posted notices to find him without any news. Therefore, the case must be resolved by Wang himself. They could not make the decision on his behalf. Then, Cai Mary and her lawyer stated Wang Songpo's various falsehoods, saying that Wang had boasted in his letters that he was friendly with Finance Minister Kong, Zheng Hongnian, Director Cai of the Finance Bureau, and Director Chen of the Jiangnan Shipyard, but all of these were lies to borrow money from the plaintiff. Furthermore, if one looks at Wang's letters to the plaintiff, every one of them mentions borrowing money. At the time of the engagement, he claimed to be a graduate of Jinan University, but now he says he graduated from Jinan High School. With such behavior, there is not a single indication of truth. How can they spend their lives together? Therefore, in accordance with Article 976, Paragraph 1, Item 9 of the Civil Code, it is requested that the engagement be cancelled and the loan of 1,000 yuan be returned. Because the defendant is not present, it is requested that a judgment be made based on the single-sided argument. Judge Peng then announced the conclusion of the argument and set a date for the judgment.</p>

<h3>Rice Store Collection Clerk Refuses to Give Money to Robbers to Protect Accounts, Flees Injured Regardless of Life, All Robbers Arrested</h3>
<p>At one o'clock in the afternoon on the 22nd of this month, Huang Buqing, a 20-year-old Zhejiang native who was a collection clerk for the Tong Shen Rice Store on Guangfu Road, Xinzha Bridge, was riding a bicycle from the store to collect accounts, totaling more than 700 yuan. When he was traveling on the Xishou Zhongshan Road of Huta Road, he suddenly encountered three robbers. One robber stopped him with a gun and forbade him from making a sound. Another robber dragged the bicycle. The collection clerk refused to hand over the accounts and struggled with the robbers to escape. The robbers, seeing him fleeing on his bicycle, were very angry that the robbery was not successful. They immediately fired three shots, three of which hit him. He continued to ride at full speed, despite his pain. He reported to the police at the nearby Changhe Rice Store before collapsing from the extreme pain. There was too much blood loss along the way, and the injury was very dangerous. The Yi Changhe Rice Store reported the incident separately. A rescue vehicle was dispatched from the Xinzha Police Station and sent Wang to Renji Hospital for treatment. The doctor at the hospital examined the injury and saw that one bullet had penetrated the chest and had not come out, so surgery was necessary. One bullet had penetrated the throat from the left neck, but fortunately, there was no obstacle. After the incident, Li Xiaobao, the captain of the Detective Branch of the West Gate Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Deputy Captain Qian Tianxiong, received confidential reports stating that the bandit Wang A'er was hiding near the small garden on Zhejiang Road. Captain Li and Deputy Captain Qian reported to Detective Brigade Chief Ji Yuanpu, Deputy Chief Wang Huibai, and West Gate Branch Chief Yao Guang, and then led detectives Jin Yushan, Lv Qingkang, and Liu Wenhui to the above-mentioned location, and together with Western detective Hui Erkao Si of the Central Police Station and Chinese detective Qian Xianting, etc., arrested the bandit Wang A'er, 30 years old, Wuxi native, living in a bungalow on Binlang Road, Gordon Road, and seized a six-inch White Langlin pistol and a bullet on the spot. The bandit was taken to the police station for registration and brought back to the West Gate Branch for interrogation. The bandit confessed that his accomplices Zhao Zhisheng and a man surnamed Chen were discussing matters at the tiger stove in Maojia Lane, Shuimending Bridge. He claimed the gun was given to him by the man surnamed Chen, and Zhao Zhisheng lived at No. 5 Zhangjiazhai, near the Fifth Bridge, Zhongshan Road. Captain Li and the original officers led the bandit Wang to the above-mentioned address to arrest Zhao Zhisheng, 31 years old, a local. According to the confession, Zhao admitted that on the 21st of this month, he, Chen, Wang A'er, and others discussed matters at the tiger stove in Maojia Lane. Later, Chen handed over a pistol at Xiamai Village. Chen investigated the news at the rice store. Wang A'er and the three of us waited at Zhongshan Road, Huta Road. Before long, the bill collector passed by on a bicycle. At that time, we blocked the road to rob, but we did not succeed. We fired to cause trouble. I also avoided it. Later, they were waiting for me at Luchun Pavilion on Zhejiang Road, but I did not go. After a brief interrogation by the West Gate Branch Chief, he ordered the Detective Branch Captain to strictly arrest the fugitives and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>The Three Robbers All Had Bloodstains, Revealing a Murder Case</h3>
<h3>They Carried No Weapons, Why Did They Flee?</h3>
<h3>Pursuit and Interrogation Will Unravel the Truth</h3>
<p>On the 21st of this month, at 7 p.m., a male corpse was discovered in a creek near Gui's residence at the southern end of Dongjiadu, Pudong. The deceased was dressed in blue cotton shirt and pants, wearing running shoes, and carried a leather wallet containing twenty yuan in banknotes and two pawn tickets. The deceased had three knife wounds to the head, a belt tied around the neck, and a felt hat lay beside the body. Because it was already dark, no one noticed. At that time, Zhang Longsheng, the head of the Nomatou Security Team, happened to be leading his men on patrol and passed by the scene. They apprehended three men acting suspiciously. Because they carried no weapons, they were released. The three men, feeling guilty, jumped into the creek and tried to escape. The team members re-crossed the creek, caught the three suspects, and brought them to the team's office. Upon seeing bloodstains on their sleeves, the murder was discovered. According to the joint confession of the three suspects, Chen Ziqing, Li Awu, and Bao Yinkui, all from Anhui, they were instigated by the wanted fugitive Li Xiaowan, so they dared to resort to such means. The deceased was identified as Li Xiaoshandong, and so on. The team then escorted the three suspects to the Tangqiao police station and transferred them to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. A message was also sent to the local Baozhang, Zhu Zhangsheng, to report to the court for an autopsy to be conducted, ordering the search for relatives of the deceased to claim the body.</p>
<h3>Russian Woman Died from a Glass Bottle Inserted into Anus</h3>
<h3>How It Was Inserted Is Unknown</h3>
<h3>Although the Bottle Was Removed, Her Life Could Not Be Saved</h3>
<p>A Russian woman named Sophia Romanova (transliteration), residing at No. 23, Lane 682, Rue Paul Beau, French Concession, was thirty-seven years old, unemployed, and depended on two lovers for a living. She was a heavy drinker, unable to go a day without alcohol. She would drink until she was completely drunk. Her health was usually excellent, but she suddenly fell ill and was confined to bed. Her lover, Sergei Philipov (transliteration, age forty-three, resident of Rue Ratard, No. 271), visited her on the 14th of this month and asked her about the cause of her illness. The woman was delirious and unable to answer. However, she had been bedridden for four or five days. Upon seeing this, her lover sent her to the Guji Hospital for treatment. After examining her, the doctor discovered a glass bottle inserted into the woman's anus, with the bottom of the bottle slightly exposed, making it impossible to extract with forceps. When asked how it had been inserted, she did not answer. The doctor performed surgery, cutting into the anus, to remove the bottle. (It is said that the inserted bottle was similar in size to a No. 2 Eau de Cologne bottle.) It was found that the internal organs had been severely damaged, and it was determined that the bottle had been inserted for some time. She was treated with medication, but ultimately died at 9 p.m. on the 22nd due to the severity of the injuries, after a week in the hospital. The hospital reported this to the French Police, who sent Detective Yang Gusiji (transliteration) to investigate. The deceased's lover, Sergei Philipov, also did not know how the bottle had been inserted, causing the illness. Another lover could not be found for questioning. The body was then sent to the morgue attached to the Public Works Department Hospital on Rue Delastre. On the 25th, the Second Special Court Prosecutor's Office was notified, and Prosecutor Wang Ren was appointed, along with a forensic doctor, clerk, and interpreter, to visit the morgue and examine the body. The investigating detective reported the details of the case and the investigation process. He then questioned the deceased's lover, Sergei Philipov, about discovering the deceased's illness and sending her to the hospital for treatment. Later, because the lover was unable to claim the body, the authorities ordered that the body be buried by the Public Welfare and Charity Association of the Public Works Department. The Police Department will investigate the cause of the deceased's injuries during her lifetime and handle the case in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Dr. Ding Huikang, Director of the Hongqiao Sanatorium, Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<h3>Returned to the Country via the Siberian Railway</h3>
<h3>Compiled World Tuberculosis Statistics in Europe</h3>
<p>Dr. Huikang, the second son of Mr. Ding Fubao, a respected figure in the Shanghai medical community, went to Europe last spring to investigate tuberculosis prevention facilities and the latest sanatorium conditions in various countries. It is now learned that Dr. Ding has completed his investigation in Europe and returned to the country via the Siberian Railway with Doctors Wang Shaoshi, Lu Yihou, and Gu Honglie. He has now arrived in Shanghai. During his time in Europe last year, Dr. Ding personally visited the North Sea Islands, European spas, Southern Germany's Mulheim, and the Swiss Alps to study the different climates and their functions. He also investigated specialized research institutes, including the Koch Institute in Berlin, the Tuberculosis Research Institute in Hamburg, the Tropical Disease Research Institute, the German National Tuberculosis Sanatorium, the Naheim Heart Disease Research Institute, the Physiological Clinic, the Children's Sanatorium, the Fort Girls' Sanatorium, the Davoss Children's Bone Tuberculosis Hospital, the Ophthalmic Tuberculosis Sanatorium, the Infectious Disease Isolation Hospital, and the Dresden Hygiene Museum, and the National Disease Insurance Company. In addition, he visited the University of Vienna, the University of Berlin, the University of Düsseldorf, the University of Hamburg, and the Universities of Munich, and their affiliated hospitals. He also met with prominent figures in the academic world, such as Professor Chai Hubaihe of Berlin, Professor Bolaoer of Hamburg, Professor Buckmeister of Frankfurt, and Professor Hulluf of Switzerland. They all highly praised the design of China's future medical center and the Hongqiao Sanatorium. They presented Dr. Ding with over a hundred specialized books. Dr. Ding also published his research on infectious diseases and donated it to various university libraries. He also compiled the latest statistics on tuberculosis in various countries in Europe for the reference of the Chinese people. Dr. Ding studied at the National Tongji University in his early years, receiving eight honorary scholarships. He was awarded a doctorate in medicine by the University of Hamburg, Germany. In 1927, he founded a tuberculosis sanatorium in Shanghai, advocating early diagnosis, X-ray group examinations, and pulmonary collapse surgery, which was widely praised. During the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, Dr. Ding established the Second Refugee Relief Hospital in the western Shanghai war zone. The facilities and treatment results were excellent. Two years ago, the Hongqiao Sanatorium, jointly designed by Dr. Ding and his respected father, was completed, and Mayor Wu held an opening ceremony. All the facilities were of the highest quality. The enthusiasm and determination of the Ding father and son in medical construction are admirable. After Dr. Ding was ordered by the Ministry to go abroad last year, the affairs of the tuberculosis hospital were continued by Du Yuesheng and Huang Hanzhi. The affairs of the Hongqiao Sanatorium were handled by Dr. Yan Fuqing, the president of the National Shanghai Medical College.</p>
<h3>The Jiangnan Company's New Locomotive Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<h3>Not a Giant Locomotive</h3>
<p>The locomotive recently purchased by the Jiangnan Railway Company from Poland arrived at the Wusong Machine Factory Wharf on the morning of the 22nd aboard the "City of Heaeforx". It was immediately unloaded. The ship left port at 3 p.m. that afternoon. It is reported that this locomotive is not a giant locomotive, and is similar to the other eighteen locomotives on the line, costing about 100,000 yuan. Because it was assembled and transported, it can be driven to the Jiangnan Railway for use as soon as it is fired up.</p>
<h3>After Li Lajie Returned the Train Fare</h3>
<h3>The Two Railway Bureaus Thoroughly Investigate the Source of Free Tickets</h3>
<h3>Li Testifies for Friends, Unwilling to Disclose; Ministry of Finance Has Sent a Letter to the Ministry of Railways Requesting Discretionary Reward</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng She reports: On the 15th of this month, newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai reported that a foreign woman, Ms. Li, feeling that using a free railway ticket given to her by a friend several years ago to travel between Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin was tantamount to stealing public funds, especially following the teachings of the Bible, repaid the full amount of the fares owed, plus one-fifth interest, and sent it to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance for transfer. Upon reading this news, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway authorities, feeling that Ms. Li's self-respect and devotion to morality was highly commendable, but in order to prevent the generosity of giving away public property, they had to thoroughly investigate who gave the tickets and when they were given. On the 16th, they sent Cao Shengzhi, Deputy Director of the General Affairs Department of the Bureau, and Wan Changqing, Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Traffic Department, to Beijing to visit Ms. Li and inquire about the truth. Ms. Li's name is Lajie, she lives at No. 7 Tian'an Lane, Zhou Biyou Lane, Nanjing. She is originally from Laiyang County, Shandong Province, not a foreigner. She studied in the United States for five years. After returning to China, she taught at Jinling University and has now resigned to devote herself to preaching. After meeting with Director Cao and others, Ms. Li replied, "I used the free tickets four or five years ago (between 1931 and 1932). I cannot recall the exact dates because it has been so long. At that time, I traveled back and forth between Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin for business. I was given the free tickets by a kind friend. Because I did not understand that this was illegal, I accepted them. I used them twice between Beijing and Tianjin and three times between Beijing and Shanghai. But I am a Christian and a pastor, so three years ago, I realized that this behavior was inappropriate and deeply regretted it. I wanted to return the ticket money to the railway authorities, but I lacked the courage to do so, and I felt uneasy in my heart. It happened that my brother (Ms. Li only used the word "Brother", so it is not clear whether it is her younger or older brother) and the current Minister of Finance Kong are members of the same organization. He suggested that I send the money to Minister Kong for deposit into the national treasury. I followed his advice and wrote a letter in English in October 1935, along with the ticket money and the Christian Bible, stipulating one-fifth interest, totaling 199.38 yuan in national currency. I sent it all together, and on November 8, I received a reply from Minister Kong stating that it had been deposited into the national treasury, and expressing his gratitude." When asked who gave the tickets, she said that she could not remember because it was so long ago. Deputy Director Cao and others then inquired at the Ministry of Finance to Secretary Li, who confirmed that the matter was true and that the ticket money had been deposited into the treasury. Deputy Director Cao and others delivered letters from the bureau when they met with Ms. Li and the Ministry of Finance. The bureau has since received reply letters from Ms. Li and Xu Jianping, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance. They are transcribed below: "I have received your letter and understand everything. Regarding the year I used the free train tickets, it was approximately between 1931 and 1932. I cannot recall the exact dates. Please forgive me. As for the friend who gave me the tickets, I am really unwilling to disclose. I am doing this only to bear witness for the Lord. I did not expect Minister Kong to announce it in the newspapers, and it also involved you. I am deeply sorry. I hope you will understand. Respectfully, Li Lajie." "In reply, we have received your Bureau's Letter No. 114, stating that a foreign woman, Ms. Li, returned the free ticket fare, and you sent Deputy Director Cao to the Ministry to inquire about the matter and requested that we provide information. After investigation, Miss Rachel Lee is actually of Chinese nationality. She is from Laiyang County, Shandong Province, and lives in Zhou Biyou Lane in Beijing. The newspapers have already corrected this. The woman sent a letter in October of last year, stating that she had used free railway tickets several years ago to travel from Nanjing to Tianjin and Shanghai. Because she was baptized and followed the teachings of the Bible, she dared not harm public funds for private gain. She especially returned the ticket fare of 199.38 yuan to the government. Our Ministry deposited the money into the treasury, and Minister Kong replied with a letter of thanks. The Ministry has also sent a letter to Minister Zhang and Vice Minister Zeng of the Ministry of Railways explaining the circumstances and requesting a discretionary reward. (The following is omitted.) Xu Jianping, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance."</p>
<h3>Brief Report on the Four Banks Savings Association's Accounts</h3>
<h3>Full Year's Net Profit of Over 2.3 Million, Members' Dividends Total 8.7 Hao</h3>
<p>Guowen She reports that the Four Banks Savings Association, known for its stability, has maintained considerable development even in years of economic recession. Recently, the Association's 1935 annual report showed that total deposits were still gradually increasing, and the use of funds was also generating profits. Statistics show that last year's net profit reached over 2.3 million, and the total amount of dividends and interest earned by depositors was 8.7 hao. The distribution of dividends based on depositor status is somewhat reminiscent of a cooperative bank. The joint and several guarantee liability undertaken by the Shanxi Salt, Yincheng, Zhongnan, and Dalu Banks for the principal and 7% interest is something that cooperative banks cannot match. Therefore, since its establishment more than a decade ago, total deposits will reach 100 million yuan, making it one of the leading savings banks in the country. Those in charge are able to be pragmatic and diligent, and are particularly frugal in spending. The total annual expenditure is only over 300,000 yuan, making the operating costs relatively low, and the benefits for depositors are also more secure.</p>

<p>Huang Guande, the owner of Da Cheng Silk and Satin Shop in Xiaodongmen, recently issued a notice stating that the shop has been established for over thirty years, with thriving business and a good reputation. However, due to the current economic downturn, development has become difficult and maintenance is also difficult. Rather than repairing after the fact, it is better to rein in the horse on the edge of the cliff. With no intention of continuing business, the decision was made to close down. Transactions with trading partners have already been cleared. All depositors are scattered in various places. Because the funds cannot be used due to the closure, the deposits should be settled and repaid as soon as possible, so that the debtors will not have to bear non-interest-bearing interest, and the creditors can deposit elsewhere to earn money. All deposits will be settled up to January 23, 1936, the end of the lunar year, and the principal and interest will be paid together. The passbooks will be collected and canceled. Because the settlement will take time, and it is also the Lunar New Year holiday, it is scheduled to begin on February 10th, the eighteenth day of the lunar New Year, at the shop, where depositors can claim their funds with their passbooks. The issued gift certificates have also been reserved with funds and will be redeemed simultaneously at the above-mentioned date and location. Starting and ending with caution, establishing trust and keeping promises. In this time of economic hardship, Mr. Huang's closure in this manner can be said to prioritize faith and righteousness.</p>

<h3>Snatching a Wallet, Shot Dead</h3>
<p>Hu Peihuan, a female student from Jiangxi Province at Fudan University in Jiangwan, residing at No. 10, Lane 27, Avenue Sieyes, French Concession, went out shopping on Nanjing Road at approximately 7 p.m. on the 20th of this month, due to having nothing to do during the winter vacation. While walking near the Guanshengyuan store, two robbers suddenly emerged from the roadside and snatched the wallet Hu was carrying. The woman shouted for help, and the robbers fled south into Huajin Lane. Nearby detectives had already heard the alarm and rushed to the scene. Among them, Chinese Constable No. 2111 chased the robbers for a considerable distance. He suddenly saw one of the robbers put his hand into his pocket. Fearing that the robber would pull out a gun and resist arrest, the constable fired four shots at the robber's back as a preemptive measure. Two bullets penetrated the robber's chest, killing him instantly. The constable retrieved the stolen wallet and returned it to the woman. He then reported to the police station and had the body taken to the morgue for examination. During the pursuit, a suspect named Ji Ziqing from Tongzhou was arrested. After strict interrogation by the police station, Ji consistently denied the crime. The next day, he was sent to the First Special Court for a brief interrogation, awaiting a later hearing.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>Regarding the article "Dispute Between Special District Rickshaw Pullers and Mutual Aid Society" published in your newspaper on January 10th, it has come to our attention that on January 9th, a number of rickshaw pullers suddenly came to our society and caused trouble, acting violently and being sentenced to imprisonment by the court. Such acts of violence should not be regarded as a dispute with our society. Furthermore, the investigation committee for this incident was organized by the board of directors of the Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society, not by the Shanghai Municipal Council Rickshaw Affairs Committee. We request that you correct this information accordingly.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>

In the second game, Shanghai played North China, and the visiting team was defeated 52-30.

The referees are Zhang Bide and Lü Gefu.</p>
<p>Nanjing Defeats Shanghai</p>
<p>The game between Nanjing and Shanghai kicked off at the Shanghai Recreation Ground at 7 PM on the 23rd. The Nanjing team has the Far East renowned player Wang Yuzeng, with exceptional strength. The Shanghai team is based on those who participated in last year's National Games, and their skills have also improved considerably after a winter of practice. At the beginning, both sides were cautious and it took a long time before a score was made. After four minutes of stalemate, Li Gongyu opened the scoring. Shanghai's Xu Heng responded. After Nanjing's Wang Yuzeng scored again, Shanghai took the lead from then on, with strong momentum. Nanjing resisted with all its might, and the situation was tense. The Shanghai team often led by a point or two. By the end of the first half, Shanghai won 18-17.</p>
<p>Changing sides and starting the second half, Shanghai made slight changes to its lineup, with Feng Nianhua and Xu Wenkui bravely taking the lead, scoring repeatedly. However, Nanjing did not show any weakness and quickly caught up. Wang Shixian and Zhao Zhihua strictly blocked the Shanghai attack, preventing Shanghai from breaking through the defense. Wang Yuzeng and Bao Wenpei made outstanding contributions, and Li Gongyu ran and grabbed quickly. The whole team cooperated well and performed skillfully. Shanghai seemed inferior at this point. As a result, Nanjing won 47-36.</p>

<p>Shanghai Defeats North China</p>
<p>In the second game, Shanghai faced North China at the Shanghai Recreation Ground on the evening of the 25th. The Shanghai team's performance improved significantly. Although North China was strong, it seemed out of sync. After each struggling in the first half, Shanghai took the lead all the way in the second half, and the victory was no longer in doubt. At the beginning, North China took the initiative and scored consecutively, taking a temporary lead of 11-4. Shanghai called a timeout and changed its strategy. Wang Nanzhen attacked and defended, boosting the morale of the whole team. Xu Heng and Feng Nianhua scored several times, and North China fell behind. By the end of the first half, Shanghai led 23-17.</p>
<p>Starting from the second half, Shanghai had smooth sailing all the way, with the score rising rapidly. North China became flustered and their movements became abnormal. When dribbling and attacking, they were often blocked by Wang and Cai, and they were at a loss. As a result, East China won by a large margin of 52-30. Sun Baoqing and Wang Nanzhen performed the best in this game. Sun was sent off for his fourth foul and replaced by Cai Yanxiong. Cai and Wang were old partners, so they added icing to the cake and did whatever they wanted.</p>

<p>Port Football Match</p>
<h3>In Rain and Snow, Hong Kong Defeats Shanghai 3-2. The Hong Kong Team's Offense and Defense Were Excellent in the First Half, 1-1. An Unprecedented Spectacle of Fighting in Rain and Snow.</h3>
<p>The annual Shanghai-Hong Kong port football match was held at the Recreation Ground on the afternoon of the Lunar New Year's Day (Friday), amidst rain and snow. As this match is traditionally held regardless of weather, both teams fought bravely in the rain and snow. As a result, Hong Kong won 3-2, retaining the "Hong Kong Radio Cup." Although it was raining and snowing, the number of people who went to the Recreation Ground was still around five or six thousand. The north stand was crowded, while the south second-class stand was only about one-third full. The enthusiasm of the audience was not diminished by the bad weather. The Hong Kong team's overall performance was better than Shanghai's, but the Shanghai forwards missed many opportunities due to inaccurate shooting, which was a great pity. Otherwise, an unexpected result would not have been impossible.</p>
<p>Two Minutes of Silence</p>
<p>This port football match coincided with the death of the British Emperor. It was originally intended to be suspended, but the Shanghai side specifically requested instructions from the Hong Kong Football Association. They received a reply by telegram, notifying them to proceed with the match as usual, but all banquets and entertainment should be suspended. Therefore, yesterday, both teams wore black armbands to show mourning when they entered the field. Before the start of the game, both teams lined up and observed two minutes of silence to show their condolences. The planned port banquet on the 8th was temporarily canceled.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Offense and Defense Are Excellent</p>
<p>Under these rainy and snowy conditions, one could not participate in the battle without real skill. In terms of performance, all parts of the Hong Kong team were better than Shanghai's. The forwards and defenders were connected seamlessly. Veteran Roger saved countless times. The firmness of the center defense line, coupled with the two defenders, was like a copper wall and iron barrier. The Shanghai team repeatedly failed to attack successfully, which was why. Under the leadership of Li Huitang, the forwards also cooperated very well, especially the activity of the two inside forwards was terrifying. Li Huitang had less activity under the surveillance of考司泰, but once he was out of the cage, danger was immediately at hand. Even under these circumstances, his shooting was as wonderful as when the weather was beautiful.</p>
<p>Shanghai Lacks Cooperation</p>
<p>Among the Shanghai team,柯拉沙 was the most hardworking, and the two also tried very hard. It is a pity that they were unable to do what they wanted. Because of the lack of cooperation among the forwards, they were unable to do anything. The result was individual combat, and the failure to make frequent use of the two wings was also a major problem. 麥達 was the most lackluster, so 小吿山奴 was able to move freely. In the second half, 麥達 was injured and replaced by陳鎭和, weakening the attack of the forwards. 考雷 are still good, and 李江 made great contributions. 當爾 was hardworking, and 鮑賽 was both meritorious and guilty. Although he saved a lot, he could not avoid the blame for losing the ball after receiving it, which led to the enemy scoring.</p>
<p>The Scenery of the Football Field</p>
<p>As for the scenery of the football field, before the start of the game, the field was already covered in water. The two sides practiced slightly in the rain and snow. After the start of the game, the rain became heavier and heavier. The players were falling up and down, covered in mud. By the second half, the rain turned to snow, and the snowflakes were flying. It was almost impossible to see where the ball was. Even the players were almost indistinguishable. The snow accumulated at least half an inch on the field. The ball was soaked in the snow and water, weighing several pounds more. It was heavy and slippery, and the suffering can be imagined. In the second half, both teams changed clothes, and a new ball was dropped to ease the burden on the players.</p>
<p>托 Scores First</p>
<p>Referee陳吉祥 was hardworking and blew the whistle to start the game in the rain. The Shanghai team kicked off. 鮑塞 sent the ball to 福恩. 黑炭 was offside and retreated. 雷米迪 advanced and passed to 派路 for a corner kick. 福恩 did not kick well, but the Shanghai team's hopes were very high. This went on for five minutes. 吿山奴 advanced straight along the side. 李惠堂's shot was too weak. 巴賽仲 sent the ball out. 巴路度 received it and passed it to 托拔, who shot straight into the corner of the net. 巴 received the ball and slipped it in. Shanghai's goal was lost first.</p>
<p>Creating a 1-1 Tie</p>
<p>After this loss, Shanghai launched a full counterattack. The five forwards besieged the Hong Kong goal. For a time, the cannon fire was continuous and the momentum was fierce. 鮑塞列 and 柯拉沙 fired continuously. If not for Roger, the Hong Kong goal would have fallen long ago. Once, Roger saved four times by punching and kicking. The ball still did not go in. After thirty minutes, 考司仄 passed to 福恩. 福恩 crossed the ball. 霍威 shot a low ball. Roger slipped after receiving it. 鮑塞列 caught up and kicked it in, creating a tie.</p>
<p>Conceding Two More Goals</p>
<p>In the second half, the players from both sides changed their clothes and returned to the field to fight. The rain stopped, but the snow was falling heavily. Only two minutes after the start, the Hong Kong team advanced with all their strength. 李惠堂 dribbled past three defenders and shot a high ball, which brushed past 江善敬's head and fell into 巴賽仲's hands. 巴 lost the ball again, making it 2-1. Seven minutes later, Hong Kong's 吿山奴 probed along the side. 李惠堂 assisted from the side, dribbling past 李寗 to a safe area. 吿山奴 calmly scored.</p>
<p>A Bitter Defeat of 2-3</p>
<p>Shanghai lost to 麥達 who was suddenly injured in front of the goal. Shanghai fought with ten men, making the situation even worse. The whole team tried their best to save the situation. For a time, the attack was very fierce. 考司泰 passed the ball to 黑炭. 黑炭 advanced past 史溫 and crossed the ball. Roger punched the ball out. 鮑塞列 caught up and headed the ball in. 麥達 was then seen returning to the team. However, Shanghai's one-goal deficit could not be saved.</p>

<h3>3-1: China Loses to Hong Kong. The Field Was Slippery with Undried Snow. The Performance of Both Sides Was Slightly Inferior. Li Huitang Scores Two Goals.</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong football team played a friendly match against the local Shanghai China team at the Shanghai Recreation Ground at 3 PM yesterday. Due to the undried snow and slippery field, the performance of both sides was slightly inferior. There were six or seven thousand spectators. As a result, Hong Kong won 3-1. The following is a record of the battle:</p>
<p>A Stalemate in the First Half</p>
<p>Hong Kong kicked off first. Both sides attacked each other fiercely, and their strength was evenly matched. The slippery field made the heroes feel useless, unable to display their talents. The Hong Kong team repeatedly tried long shots, but they were all weak and failed to achieve their goal. 李國威 was injured and left the field during the Chinese team's attack. He returned shortly after, but the Hong Kong team's morale was not discouraged. 小吿山奴's header in front of the goal gave the Chinese team a great fright. 李義臣 and 賈幼良's shots were inaccurate. The Hong Kong team continued to attack, taking the upper hand. 托拔 and 小吿山奴 showed their prowess in front of the goal, which was very dangerous. Fortunately, the inside defense was strong. The ball king 李惠堂 was also closely watched by 陳鎭祥, so he was spared from danger. 黑炭陳鎭和 ran all over the field, making great contributions. However, the forwards' feet were inaccurate and their movements were slow. The center defense line was unable to respond quickly, so even if there were good opportunities, they were missed. Neither side scored in the first half.</p>
<p>Li the Ball King's Kick Opens the Scoring</p>
<p>After the break, the teams switched sides and continued the battle. The Chinese team's passing was clear and beautiful. It was a pity that 賈幼良 missed the opportunity at the last moment. The Chinese team attacked the enemy's goal in one go, with great momentum. However, they lacked shooting skills. After Hong Kong survived the crisis, they were back in front of the city. The ball passed twice in front of the goal without going in, which was also fortunate. Hong Kong attacked again and snatched the ball past the inside defense, rolling it towards the side of the goal. 榮才 failed to receive it, resulting in a corner kick. Unexpectedly, this led to a big mistake. 碧福's kick was perfectly placed. 李惠堂 received the ball in the midst of the chaos and lightly kicked it into the left corner of the goal, opening the scoring.</p>
<p>Conceding Three Goals, Fighting Back to Score One</p>
<p>The biggest shortcoming of the Chinese team was their slow movements in front of the goal. Once, three forwards besieged the Hong Kong goal in front of the Hong Kong goal. Roger lay on the ground, but the ball was still saved by 派路. Misfortune came one after another. 江善敬's kick hit 梁樹棠's body and bounced back to 李惠堂's feet, who kicked it in, and the ball窜 entered the right corner of the goal. 張榮才 lay down and tried to save, but it was too late. They conceded two goals. Continuing their efforts, 小吿山奴 crossed the ball. 托拔 caught up and kicked it in, conceding three goals. The three center forwards of the Chinese team gathered the remaining troops and attacked the inside defense line. As expected, luck came and 李義臣 passed the ball to 孫錦順, who caught up and kicked it in, scoring a goal. After seven more minutes of melee, the game ended with a score of 3-1.</p>

<p>—More Than Twenty Important Proposals for Social Education Facilities Resolved</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Guangzhou, our newspaper) The previous three annual meetings of the China Social Education Society were held in Hangzhou, Jinan, and Kaifeng respectively. This year's (fourth) annual meeting, with the welcome of National Sun Yat-sen University and the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education, was held at the old site of National Sun Yat-sen University on Wenming Road, Guangzhou, starting from January 18th and lasting for five days, closing on the 22nd.</p>
<p>Attending Representatives　At this annual meeting, representatives from various provinces including Jiangxi, Hebei, Guangxi, Fujian, Shandong, Hunan, and Hubei, along with individual members, totaled more than 220 people. Their ancestral homes included more than 20 provinces and cities such as Henan, Hubei, and Hebei. The official opening ceremony was held on the 18th. Central representatives Qu Fangpu, Ministry of Education representative Huang Linshu, Guangdong Provincial Government representative Jin Zencheng, National Sun Yat-sen University President Zou Lu, Lingnan University President Zhong Rongguang, and member Yu Qingtang, among others, were present, and the atmosphere was exceptionally enthusiastic.</p>

There were more than forty proposals in total. After the meeting, everyone took cars to the Tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs at Huanghuagang to pay their respects, then visited the new campus of National Sun Yat-sen University in Shipai and attended a banquet hosted by the university.</p>
<p>Focus of Discussion　The focus of this annual meeting was "Social Education to Assist Local Autonomy and Promote Social Production." The board of directors had previously established a Central Issues Committee to collect opinions from all members and compile discussion outlines, divided into three sections: "Assisting Local Autonomy," "Promoting Social Production," and "Actions the Society Should Take." The discussion began on the second day of the annual meeting and continued until the fourth day. During the discussion, members repeatedly examined the causes of the failure of local autonomy and the lack of social production in China and their solutions. Ultimately, it was decided that the issues were extremely important and should be returned to the Central Issues Committee for further analysis and summarization to serve as a path for members' future efforts and research.</p>
<p>Resolutions of the General Assembly　The proposals were reviewed by the group review meetings and then submitted to the general assembly for discussion.

At the closing ceremony, Mr. Niu Tiesheng, a member of the society and current Vice President of the Central Examination Yuan, gave a speech, full of warnings.</p>
<p>Supplementary Election of Directors　At this general assembly, five directors whose terms had expired were to be re-elected. The results of the vote showed that Yu Qingtang, Liang Shuming, Gao Yang, and Zhao Mian received the most votes. The board of directors then publicly elected Li Zheng as a director. At the fourteenth board meeting held in Guangdong, Liang Shuming, Yu Qingtang, and Zhao Mian were publicly elected as standing directors, and Zhao Mian was appointed as general secretary.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the meeting in Guangdong, the society organized a Guangxi inspection group to visit Guangxi to inspect the popular basic education and various construction projects. About sixty people joined the inspection group, and it is said that they set off for Guangxi immediately after the closing of the meeting.</p>
<h3>Dispute Between the Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Over Subsidies for Students Studying in Japan　Subsidies for 300 Students Totaling 180,000 Yen　The Ministry of Home Affairs Opposes the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Intention to Maintain Them</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Tokyo by our Shanghai office) The Cultural Affairs Department of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs subsidizes 300 students studying in Japan each year, with 50 yen per student per month, totaling 180,000 yen annually. Recently, the Ministry of Home Affairs believes that the use of this large sum of money has resulted in many anti-Japanese elements and communists, which contradicts the original intention, and therefore opposes it. The debate has been fierce. The following is a translation of the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun's report as a dispatch:</p>
<p>Ministry of Home Affairs Claims Kindness Repaid with Enmity</p>
<p>The Cultural Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs provides subsidies of 50 yen per month to 300 middle school students studying in Japan, amounting to 180,000 yen per year. Among these students, some have been found to be communists and deported by the Ministry of Home Affairs. Other returning students with excellent grades have also repaid kindness with enmity, joining anti-Japanese groups. Because they have studied in Japan and understand the situation in Japan, their anti-Japanese tactics are even more malicious. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, regretting that the subsidies, intended to promote amicable Sino-Japanese relations, have had the opposite effect, has issued a warning, drawing the attention of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and will raise the issue for discussion at the upcoming joint meeting of the two ministries.</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Claims Facts Do Not Match</p>
<p>According to Director Okada of the Cultural Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the approximately 300 Chinese students studying in Japan who receive subsidies from the Cultural Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have all been carefully considered and recommended by their schools, and there have been no inappropriate cases. As for the fact that some of the Chinese students receiving subsidies have engaged in communist or anti-Japanese movements after returning to China, there has been no such information so far.</p>

<p>Children's Educational Novel</p>
<h3>Little Men (1)(5)(8)</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"You can't teach me to believe that he did it, even if you say it with all your might, I won't believe it," said Tom, and others even whistled, indicating that the child's sophistry was ridiculous; because this little saint—that was their nickname for him—was beyond any suspicion.</p>
<p>When Ned saw that they spoke of the bridge and spoke of him with different tones, he would rather give up all that he had, or all that he could ever have, to gain that kind of unconditional trust; because he had seen how easy it was for a person to lose the trust of others, and how difficult it was to restore it, so he suddenly realized how precious honesty was, because he had already suffered greatly from his occasional negligence.</p>
<p>Mr. Bhaer was happy to see that this matter had come to a conclusion, and was optimistically waiting for some new developments. They actually came, more quickly than they expected, but this matter also left him shocked and bewildered. That day they were at dinner when a loaf of bread was delivered to Mr. Bhaer from Mrs. White, the neighbor. There was also a letter. As Mr. Bhaer read the letter, Nat opened the loaf and, upon seeing the contents, shouted:</p>
<p>"Oh, this is Uncle Tandy's book for Don!"</p>
<p>All that was heard from Don's side was a sound of "Damn!"</p>

<h3>The Bimetallic System and the Silver Problem</h3>
<p>— Sen Yu</p>
<p>(I) Raising the Price of Silver and the Bimetallic System</p>
<p>Silver has been excluded from the monetary scope of general capitalist countries. Except for a very few economically backward countries that still use it as a monetary material, it is generally no longer regarded as an object of wealth and has become no different from an ordinary commodity. As a result, the demand for silver has been declining and its price has fallen. Furthermore, due to the increasing demand for gold, the price of gold has risen, and the price of silver has become relatively lower. During the European War, it once rebounded, but it was only a flash in the pan, and it continued to fall after the war. Recently, the world economic panic has deepened, followed by the decline in the prices of general commodities. The price of silver has also fallen further. Moreover, due to the development of silver production technology and the increase in production, it is impossible for backward countries in the Far East and South America to fully absorb it. Therefore, the decline in the price of silver has become more and more severe, and far exceeds the degree of the decline in ordinary commodity prices.</p>
<p>The decline in the price of silver is actually an inevitable result of the development of contradictions in the capitalist world. We naturally cannot, like vulgar economists, put the cart before the horse and regard it as the main factor of the world economic panic. However, the profoundness of the economic panic it reflects and its reaction to the panic are also undeniable facts.</p>
<p>In order to restore the price of silver, many people are trying to adjust the supply and demand of silver, so as to increase the demand for silver. They believe that solving the silver problem can solve the economic panic. At present, there are many countermeasures to raise the price of silver. Generally speaking, they can be divided into two categories: monetary outlets and commodity outlets, as shown in the table below: (See "Some Problems in the World Monetary System" by Kanahara Zunosuke) Sell and store silver;</p>
<p>The plan to restore the price of silver from the commodity aspect has been actively implemented by the United States, such as the silver agreement in the World Economic Conference and the silver bills promulgated over time. However, this kind of artificial and forced method will inevitably produce deformed results. Even if it can maintain the price of silver at a certain level for a while, it cannot be expected to last for a long time, and there is still a risk of falling after a short period of time. Therefore, most people believe that to fundamentally relieve the silver panic, it is necessary to seek a way out in the monetary aspect, and the US silver policy, in focusing on the commodity aspect, also has a monetary route.</p>
<p>However, the expansion of the shape and use of silver subsidiary coins in the monetary aspect in the above table has very little contribution to the recovery of the silver price, and it seems to be of little help. It is obviously impossible in fact for various countries to restore the silver standard system under the current world monetary dynamics. Recently, what has been discussed more enthusiastically belongs to (5) the gold and silver bimetallic system, and (6) the gold and silver mixed standard system developed from the gold and silver bimetallic system. As for (2) including silver in the gold reserve, it is actually close to the gold and silver mixed standard system, and (3) issuing silver securities with silver as reserve under the gold standard system is close to the gold and silver bimetallic system.</p>
<p>(II) The Content of the Gold and Silver Bimetallic System</p>
<p>Now, let's take a look at the content of the gold and silver bimetallic system?</p>
<p>The gold and silver bimetallic system (Bimelallism) is different from the gold and silver parallel standard system (Barallel Standard) and the limping standard system (Limping Standard). Under the gold and silver parallel standard system, although both gold and silver coins can be infinitely legal tender and can be freely coined, a statutory ratio is not established, and people use the market price as the standard when using them. Under the limping standard system, both gold and silver coins are also recognized as infinite legal tender, and a ratio is established, but the free coinage of silver coins is not allowed. As for the pure gold and silver bimetallic system, it must have the following four main conditions:</p>
<p>The law stipulates that both gold and silver coins are infinite legal tender;</p>
<p>Free coinage of gold and silver coins is allowed;</p>
<p>There is a certain statutory ratio between gold and silver coins;</p>
<p>Free import and export of gold and silver.</p>
<p>However, the so-called statutory ratio often differs from the actual market ratio, so Gresham's Law—the law of bad money driving out good money—often appears between surplus coins and silver coins. For example, the statutory ratio of gold and silver is one to sixteen, that is, one ounce of gold is equal to sixteen ounces of silver. If the actual ratio of gold and silver on the market is one to fifteen, then gold is cheap and silver is expensive, gold is bad money, and silver is good money: therefore, gold coins—bad money—are mostly used for payment, and silver coins—good money—will disappear from the market, and they will all be taken to the mint to be melted into silver ingots, or exported abroad for profit, or gold coins will be cast in exchange for silver. As a result, the bimetallic system will inevitably become a gold single standard system. Conversely, if gold is expensive and silver is cheap, such as the current ratio of one to sixty, then gold is good money and silver is bad money, and only silver coins will be seen on the market, and gold coins will not be seen, becoming a silver single standard system. This kind of effect is called the alternating effect, so the bimetallic system is actually a type of alternating standard system (Alternative Standard).</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, when silver is expensive and gold is cheap, and most people use low-priced gold coins, the demand for gold increases greatly, so the price of gold tends to rise again, and the relative price of silver falls. Also, when silver coins are melted into silver ingots, and the supply of silver ingots increases, the price of silver will inevitably fall back, and the price of gold will rise relatively. As a result, the market ratio of gold and silver can still return to the previous balance, and is similar to the statutory ratio. Conversely, the situation is exactly the same when gold is expensive and silver is cheap. This kind of effect is called the equalization effect (Ecuiiibratory Action) or compensatory effect (Compensatory Aetioin), which is the most important theoretical basis of the bimetallic system.</p>
<p>Due to the shift in the world economic situation, there are very few coins circulating on the market, almost all of which are banknotes. The metallic standard currency has actually been separated from the circulation process. Metal is purely a means of guarantee domestically and is only used for external payments. Therefore, the bimetallic system in the future cannot be exactly the same as that of half a century ago, and its form roughly has the following two types:</p>
<p>First, both gold and silver are used as reserves for issuing banknotes and concentrated in the central agency. Gold banknotes are issued for gold, and silver banknotes are issued for silver. Gold and silver are traded by the central agency according to the statutory ratio. People can hold gold banknotes to exchange for gold and silver banknotes to exchange for silver. In this case, only gold banknotes are used in place of gold coins, and silver banknotes are used in place of silver coins, and there is not much difference in essence from the previous bimetallic system. As for Gresham's Law and the alternating effect and equalization effect, they appear more slowly because they have to go through the banknote exchange stage.</p>
<p>Second, both gold and silver are also used as reserves for issuing banknotes and concentrated in the central agency. The central agency buys and sells at a certain price, but the banknotes issued for gold reserves and silver reserves are not clearly distinguished as gold banknotes or silver banknotes. The central agency has the right to choose whether to pay gold or silver when banknotes are exchanged for cash. In this case, if the central bank can still fully comply with the wishes of those who request redemption and pay gold or silver when the price of gold and silver fluctuates, the situation is not much different from the first type, and the continuation of the bimetallic system can still be maintained due to the compensation effect. However, if the central government ignores the wishes of those who request redemption and only allows silver to be paid while refusing to pay gold when the price of silver falls, then in fact gold has been excluded from the monetary meaning, and the bimetallic system has changed into a silver single standard system.</p>
<p>What is the effect of the bimetallic system?</p>
<p>According to the current views of bimetallic system advocates, it is believed that adopting the bimetallic system can have the following advantages:</p>
<p>Using silver to supplement the shortage of gold, so as to save the decline in prices and economic recession caused by the shortage of gold.</p>
<p>The quantity of currency and credit is based on two metals, which can raise the price level.</p>
<p>Due to the equalization effect, prices can tend to balance.</p>
<p>The problem of silver outlet is solved, and the price of silver can be increased, so the economic panic caused by the decline in the price of silver can be overcome.</p>
<p>The increase in the price of silver can increase the purchasing power of silver-using countries, especially China.</p>
<p>The exchange rate between bimetallic countries and gold standard and silver standard countries can be stabilized.</p>
<p>Now, let's analyze what the effects of these items are?</p>
<p>First, let's take the first item. Capitalist economists mostly blindly or deliberately cover up the various relationships of commodity production contradictions in the current society, obliterate the basic factors of the current economic panic, put the cart before the horse, and instead shift most of the responsibility for the panic to the currency. They believe that the current decline in prices and economic recession are due to the lack of gold for application. As a result, the "gold shortage theory" of Gustav Cassel and others was produced. Cassel said that the reason why prices have fallen is because of the lack of gold supply. This kind of argument is actually based on the result of the "fetishism" of gold. They completely ignore that the panic of gold is an inevitable phenomenon of production imbalance under the development of capitalist economy. Moreover, in the era of monopoly capitalism, the increase in gold accumulation is undoubtedly an inevitable fact. Advocates of the bimetallic system believe that using silver to supplement the shortage of gold can save the economic recession, which is actually also caught in the confusion of the "fetishism" of gold. Even if silver can solve the panic of gold shortage, the result will still be a crisis with the redevelopment of capitalist contradictions.</p>
<p>It is not necessarily true that the quantity of currency and credit is changed to be based on gold and silver, which can raise the price level a little. If the statutory ratio of gold and silver is the same as or very close to the market ratio after the implementation of the bimetallic system, then in the case of the current ratio of one to sixteen, even if all the production of silver is used for currency purposes, the relative increase in the metallic material of the currency is actually not much different from the era when gold is the only base; therefore, not much can be expected for the rise in prices. Assuming that the statutory ratio of gold and silver is far from the market ratio, and artificially force a large increase, such as a ratio of one to sixteen, its stimulation of the rise is also limited and very volatile. Moreover, Gresham's Law will definitely play a dramatic role. The so-called good money, gold coins, will be driven out by the bad money, silver coins, and will eventually become a chaotic silver single standard system. Countries without abundant gold reserves will be exhausted after the outflow of gold, and the equalization effect may not be produced, and it is impossible to restore the balance. As a result, the bimetallic commodity loses the anarchic mass production, resulting in overproduction; on the one hand, the masses are in an extremely exploited position and lack purchasing power. Under this kind of deformed contradiction, how can prices not fall? Monetary policy is just a shot of morphine. How can it be possible to maintain prices for a long time without falling again?</p>
<p>Due to the equalization effect of the bimetallic system, prices can tend to balance: this is theoretically correct, and it is also the most important theoretical basis of the bimetallic system. However, in fact, it is not necessarily so. As mentioned above, the change in prices cannot be stabilized purely by monetary policy. Moreover, the equalization effect can only be smooth when most countries adopt the bimetallic system. In the current era of economic nationalism, international coordination is difficult to expect, and the scope of adopting the bimetallic system may not be extensive. Since there is a lack of mutual adjustment among countries, the equalization effect will inevitably be restricted horizontally. And as mentioned above, countries without sufficient gold reserves will only be burdened by Gresham's Law, and it is not easy to transform its compensatory effect. Also, if the production of gold or silver is too much for a while, and it cannot be fully absorbed, the equalization effect will be of no avail.</p>
<p>The so-called raising the price of silver and restoring prosperity is not that simple. According to the current market ratio of gold and silver of one to sixty, raising the price of silver seems to conflict with the bimetallic system; as mentioned above, if the statutory ratio of gold and silver is the same as or not much different from the market ratio, the price of silver will not be raised at all. If the statutory ratio of gold and silver is raised to one to sixteen, the production of silver will inevitably increase greatly, and the stored silver will also be dumped as much as possible, and the price of silver will still not be able to maintain to the end. In addition, due to the relationship of Gresham's Law, the bad money of silver drives out the good money of gold. If the compensatory effect does not follow at the same time, there is a place where it will turn into an unnatural silver single standard. Or the price of silver is indeed raised, but if the prices of other general commodities do not rise at the same time, prosperity will still have no way out.</p>
<p>The increase in the price of silver is that silver-using countries, especially China, can use it to increase their purchasing power. There have been past facts to prove this, and it seems that there is no need to repeat it. Since the United States has actively implemented the silver policy, China's appetite for absorbing commodities has not only not increased at all, but has even declined due to the intensification of panic. The increase in the price of silver relatively shows the low price of goods in silver-using countries; this is contrary to the original purpose of promoting the general rise in prices.</p>
<p>The exchange rate between countries implementing the bimetallic system and gold standard countries and silver standard countries can indeed be relatively stable, and trade between them can also be smoother. However, this requires abundant gold reserves and silver reserves to adjust. China, as a semi-colonial country, cannot talk about this at all.</p>
<p>Based on the above analysis, it can be seen that the effect of the bimetallic system can never be as perfect as imagined by the advocates, and there are many indelible shortcomings.</p>
<p>The So-called Gold and Silver Mixed Standard System</p>
<p>There is now another gold and silver mixed standard system (Symmetallism) developed from the pure bimetallic system; it is also called the new bimetallic system or the scientific bimetallic system.</p>
<p>This was advocated by Alfred Marshall, a neoclassical economist in England. He believed that the pure bimetallic system was not stable enough as a value standard, and that gold and silver should be mixed to cast a standard coin to replace the independent currency of gold and silver. Or banknotes are issued and used without coining coins, stipulating the statutory weight ratio of gold and silver. A pound of banknotes originally contained one one three grams of gold (Grain, I grain 0.0648 gram), but now it is replaced with five six point five grams of gold, and several times or twenty times of silver (one point one three zero grams), that is, banknotes are issued according to this ratio. When banknotes are exchanged for cash, two kinds of metals are also delivered according to this ratio. Therefore, under this system, all payments are not one kind of metal, but must be two kinds of metals with a certain ratio. Marshall discussed that the characteristics of this system are roughly the following:</p>
<p>The value of the currency varies according to the average value of gold and silver</p>
<p>It can avoid the occurrence of Gresham's Law and avoid the phenomenon of bad money driving out good money;</p>
<p>It cannot be deformed into an alternating standard system or a single standard system;</p>
<p>It can be implemented by a country alone by stipulating the gold and silver ratio, and it does not need to obtain international agreement like the pure bimetallic system;</p>
<p>If all countries in the world can adopt it, it can complete the complete international basis of currency and prices.</p>
<p>However, is the gold and silver mixed standard system really so stable? According to factual observation, the shortcomings included in the pure bimetallic system cannot be avoided in general. In theory, banknotes must be issued with both gold and silver, and the same amount of gold and silver must be paid when they are exchanged for cash. Therefore, there is indeed no danger of a unique panic of gold or silver on the side of the central issuing agency, and it can maintain the balance of reserves, which is correct. However, Gresham's Law can still be brewing internally, such as when the market prices of gold or silver fluctuate sharply: it will inevitably encounter difficulties. If the central agency stops exchanging for one kind of gold or silver when necessary, this system will be completely destroyed. International coordination is obviously difficult. If a country alone establishes this system, the exchange rate between that country and other gold single standard countries and silver single standard countries will inevitably be volatile, and trade and investment will also be hindered: because the weight ratio is inconsistent with the market price, when measuring the value of this currency with gold or silver alone, it is inevitable that it will often be unstable.</p>
<p>Or it is said that the synthesis of gold and silver can adopt a value ratio instead of a weight ratio; for example, its synthesis ratio stipulates that the value of gold is three-quarters and silver is one-quarter. Only the weight of gold is fixed and unchanged, and the weight of silver is not fixed, but increases or decreases according to the market price fluctuation of silver to gold to maintain its value ratio. However, there are even more shortcomings in this method:</p>
<p>First, if the gold and silver synthesis ratio is based on the market price, it will be more difficult to achieve the originally expected increase in the price of silver and general prices;</p>
<p>Second, since the synthesis ratio increases or decreases with the fluctuation of gold and silver market prices, the currency will inevitably be in a state of constant change:</p>
<p>Third, due to the fluctuation of the silver price, the value of the silver reserve of the issuing agency will also change at the same time, and there will be a risk of suffering unexpected losses.</p>
<p>The United States and the Bimetallic System</p>
<p>The United States is the great owner of the world's silver production, and it ranks second in the world in terms of its own silver production; in Mexico, the first place, the United States accounts for eight-tenths of all silver mine capital; in Canada, the fourth silver-producing country in the world, two-tenths of the silver mine capital belongs to the United States. It is estimated that more than 60% of the total global silver production is under the control of US capital. Since the United States has such an inseparable close relationship with silver, it is naturally very concerned about the decline in the price of silver. In addition to the recent silver policy, as far back as the second half of the nineteenth century, there were already bills to raise the price of silver.</p>
<p>Although the current factors of the US silver policy have very complex domestic and international bases; it is preparing to implement the gold and silver method, so it is actively attempting to restore silver as a monetary use. In the recent silver bills, the activities of the bimetallic system have been very obvious: the so-called Thomas Amendment in the third part of the Emergency Agricultural Relief Act in May 1933 once stipulated that the President has the right to decide the gold and silver ratio, freely coin gold and silver coins, and adopt the bimetallic system; the dies' silver Bill in March 1934 also has additional clauses for increasing the coinage of silver coins; the Silver Purchase Act of June of the same year has in fact made further progress on the issue of gold and silver bimetallic system for goods, and the main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Increase the silver reserve of the treasury to reach gold seventy-five and silver twenty-five, that is, the reserve ratio of gold to silver is three to one;</p>
<p>Authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to issue silver certificates with silver as reserve</p>
<p>In addition to doing its best to restore the monetary status of silver in the country, so as to form a gold and silver bimetallic system, the United States also discusses the issue of restoring the gold and silver bimetallic system with other countries.</p>
<p>At present, the United States is becoming more and more active on the bimetallic system, not only engaging in it domestically, but also starting to develop it abroad. The United States regards the bimetallic system as a tool to raise prices and restore domestic economic prosperity on the one hand, and on the other hand, it attempts to expand it to the international field, coercing countries to implement it at the same time, and controlling it, so as to manipulate international finance. Its first targets are Mexico and Canada; its resolutions are Chile, Peru, other Latin American countries, and China, Egypt, etc.; and finally it intends to threaten the major countries in the world to completely include them. Its ambition is far-reaching and astonishing. At the end of last year, when Mexican Finance Minister Zuarez visited the United States, it was heard that the United States would also conduct the same discussions with Peru, Canada, etc., and there was a brewing of an international silver conference. In addition, the United States' advancement to China has never been forgotten, so it is eager for China's monetary system to get rid of the relationship with the pound sterling as soon as possible and take the road of the bimetallic system. It is rumored that the United States is planning to exchange gold for Chinese silver, which is not without reason.</p>
<p>In short, the ultimate goal of the United States is to implement the international bimetallic system; but does it have the hope of success? According to the current situation, the future seems to be very slim. If it is established through coordination, then according to past historical experience and the current war of resistance against the United States by the International Pound Group, it is an inevitable fact. Even if a partial bimetallic group, such as including the United States, Mexico, Canada, other Central and South American countries, and China, etc., is afraid that it may not be as smooth as imagined. As for the United States alone or adding one or two countries, although there is considerable possibility, there are still difficulties, and the effectiveness after implementation is not necessarily absolutely reliable. It already possesses a large amount of gold and silver, but it cannot grasp the whole world in its hands. If the gold and silver ratio in the international market cannot be stabilized independently, then the danger of the bimetallic system shaking, whether it can be maintained to the end, is not dare to be certain.</p>
<p>The Bimetallic System and China</p>
<p>Finally, I have to talk about the problem of China and the bimetallic system.</p>
<p>Based on the above-mentioned various shortcomings and obstacles, the bimetallic system naturally has many of the same difficulties for China; and as for the exchange of gold for Chinese silver, etc.; and there are quite a few people in China who agree with it. Some people think that since China has suffered from the sudden rise and fall of silver prices, it should use gold to restrain it, so it is very suitable to implement the bimetallic system. Some people advocate using the bimetallic system as a transition to the gold standard. However, these are all arguments that disregard the actual situation. In my personal opinion, I feel that there are several points that China should pay special attention to when implementing the bimetallic system:</p>
<p>The source of gold reserves may not be as easy as imagined. Even if the United States is willing to provide assistance, it must be with considerable conditions attached, or it will damage China's sovereignty;</p>
<p>The world's gold and silver market prices are completely in the hands of others, and China has no right to intervene, so it is extremely difficult to maintain the statutory ratio, and it will inevitably suffer the harm of double fluctuations of gold and silver; having one more currency in China at present will only increase the chaos and make it difficult to circulate smoothly;</p>
<p>If it grows and is implemented under the control of others, the result will still be reduced to a subordinate status.</p>
<p>In short, it is quite difficult and not advisable for China to implement the bimetallic system at present.</p>

<h3>General Summary of Financial Conditions After the End of the Year</h3>
<p>This Thursday was Lunar New Year's Eve. Business, industry, and various aspects of income and expenditure generally used this day as the final accounting period. Therefore, business on this day lasted all night. Although this difficult period was passed relatively smoothly on the surface, the market afterwards was generally not as smooth as usual. In the past few days, it was customarily closed for business and will only fully start business on (the 28th), but only half a day in the morning. And the afternoon is temporarily closed as usual. The desire to open the afternoon market will be after the Lunar New Year Lantern Festival. Now the silver and money industry market conditions during the suspension period of this newspaper will be recorded as follows. The interest rate on short-term loans was completely unchanged and was 8%. There was not much change in interbank bills. The daily turnover was more than 3 million, the new trading was more than 670,000, and the afternoon trading was 2-300,000. The small general association completely returned to the treasury.

<h3>Securities: Speculators are Cautious, New York Stock Market Finally Declines</h3>
<p>New F丰 洋行 reported that yesterday (24th) the New York stock market saw mixed gains and losses. Rumors of inflation were widespread, creating a sense of impending storm. When the House rejected the President's bonus bill veto, automobile, railroad, utility, steel, and farm equipment stocks all rebounded. However, as speculators became more cautious, prices fell again. Although President Roosevelt issued a statement denying the rumors, it was still widely rumored that the government was about to announce a surprising silver policy. Copper mines were relatively strong, as buyers used them to hedge against inflation. In terms of commodity exchanges, coffee, wool, rubber, and cocoa all rose to new highs. Small exchange stocks were active and mixed. Bond prices rose slightly, except for US government bonds. The total daily trading volume was 2.54 million shares.

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Yidao)</p>
<p>The Western calendar year is "1936." Let me measure the character and calculate the fate for this "1936" year. "1936" is a homophone for "一救衰落" (yi jiu shuai luo), meaning "save decline"! In the past year, all kinds of "decline" phenomena have affected China; the "decline" of commerce and the "decline" of national power have become increasingly extreme.</p>
<p>But this year, as long as our compatriots can work together to recover and save the country, we can "save decline."</p>
<p>Isn't it? Some fortune tellers have said that the Second World War will occur in "1936" in northern China!</p>
<p>If our country can quickly prepare for the incident, it will be as hopeful as the revitalized countries after the European War.</p>
<p>At that time, China's "decline" will end! It is saved…</p>
<h3>Talking about Snow</h3>
<p>— Yimei</p>
<p>"The immortal's clothes are not stained by clouds, the celestial being's appearance is flawless like jade." This is Cui Defu's poem about snow. Snow, lightly fluttering, widely falling, sometimes solidifying and sometimes melting, can be tasted and appreciated. Truly the ultimate ability of creation, exhausting the ingenuity of craftsmanship.</p>
<p>"Youmengying" says: "Looking at mountains from a building, watching snow from a city wall." It takes its height and overlooks the entire scene. I say that if you take an airplane and look down at the world, all white and boundless, with dazzling brilliance, you will feel that this mortal world is no longer so cramped, which is more than enough to please people's minds.</p>
<p>It is said that some people hate white and stay indoors when it snows heavily because of the color, which is laughable.</p>
<p>In the past, the Iron-Footed Daoist walked barefoot in the snow, chewing plum blossoms, and using it with snow. With such behavior, there is no need to burn pills and practice mercury, which is enough to become immortal.</p>
<p>In ancient people's poems, jade is often compared to snow, such as Pei Qianyu's saying: "After the rain, the carved jade is colorful," Li Shangyin said: "I have praised the jade tree with the red decree," Emperor Taizong of Tang said: "Coagulated jade covers the snow," Yan Shu said: "Each jade trunk is twelve stories high," and Zhang Zhengjian said: "The cloud dream rises from the jade field." However, "Kunxuejiwen" said: "Jade is red jade, so it should not be used by those who praise snow."</p>
<p>Recently, I checked "Yibanlu" and recorded the heavy snow of the past year: "Jiangzhe is extremely cold, far inferior to the north, and the snow has not reached a foot. In the twelfth year of Daoguang, it was said to be rare, but in the winter of Xinchou last year, Changzhao snow reached two feet, roads were cut off, and pedestrians could not pass. After opening it, it was slightly like the snow wall of Jinchuan Weixi. The southern roads, Huzhou Nanxun, etc., were large, and the snow in Hangzhou was even larger and reached the height of a human. Opening a zhang in the city cost 350 wen, and many houses were collapsed. It was necessary to light a lamp in the room, and it was impossible to distinguish directions when going out. Many poor people died of freezing and starvation, which had never been experienced before." Compared with the snow disasters in Georgia and New York in the United States, streetcars were completely stopped, electric lights and telephones were damaged, and 45,000 snow sweepers and 2,000 snow plows were used to fight the snowstorm, which is equally comparable.</p>
<p>I have seen Ren Fuzhang's painting "Sending Charcoal in the Snow," and the characters are ancient and vivid on the paper. According to legend, "When Fuzhang made this painting, the weather was cold and the year was late, and he was trapped in a poor village. Someone generously gave him twenty gold coins, and Fuzhang used this painting to repay him."</p>
<p>Among the vegetables, there is Xue Li Hong. When the vegetables in the snow are damaged by frost, this vegetable is the only one that is green, so it is named after it. After pickling it for a dream, and eating plenty of fatty and sweet foods, eating a little bit of it is refreshing and incomparable, and it is also an indispensable thing for banquets.</p>

<h3>Elegant Offerings for a Cold Window</h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>There are many kinds of elegant offerings on the table, but the small stone calamus, planted in a white porcelain pot, is the most enjoyable to appreciate. It is indeed worth putting it next to the inkstone during this severe winter, between the brush rack, finely green like a lawn, pleasing to the eye and delightful to the heart, and can be called a unique masterpiece. However, cultivation is more difficult. If you do not apply manual work and let it grow naturally, it is not very desirable, and is only used for medicinal purposes and as an auxiliary product.</p>
<p>The method of cultivation is to first dig up the roots of the calamus from the ground, then remove the leaves, fill a tank with more than half of river water, and then place the roots inside. After several hours, if you see air bubbles floating on the surface of the water, continuously emitting, you must discard the turbid water and replace it with clear water to adjust it. This is the most important. If after two or three days, the roots show signs of life, or you see sprouts, then the seedlings are ready, and you can add surgery.</p>
<p>The method is to tie the bark of the palm tree to both ends of the extremely long pine needles, but you must first boil them in a pot, because the pine needles contain a lot of acidity. If it is not removed by boiling heat, it cannot be applied. Then gather the pine needles into a bundle, with a diameter of more than two inches, and cut it horizontally with a knife, dividing it into two halves. Then cut the roots of the calamus to about half an inch and insert them into the pine needles. The finer and denser, the better. Stop when you can't insert any more. Finally, wrap the millet skin on the outside, and then tie it tightly with palm rope, and put it back into the water tank, placing it in a place where you cannot see the sunlight, between the moss masonry in the corner of the wall, and pay attention to its dryness and wetness at any time. After one month, it will be green and lovely, and I will definitely make it a pot play after two months, which is very enjoyable.</p>
<p>The so-called "stacked calamus" is actually not tied with millet, but it has become a term along the way: however, it is often listed in the room, lacking air, which is also not suitable, because plants also need to breathe. After a long time, it is inevitable to suffer from suffocation. Therefore, at night, you must move it to the courtyard to soak in the dew to moisten its dryness and thirst. If not, its leaves will gradually turn yellow, and the roots will also rot. This must be taken with caution; if this kind of planting method is done in the autumn, it is now visible, and if it is carried out at the present time, it will definitely be green and lovely until the Lunar New Year's Day.</p>

<h3>Yi Junzuo's "Half Month"</h3>
<p>— (Ge Xianning)</p>
<p>Yi Junzuo is an outstanding poet of the contemporary era. His poems have long been well-known and have even been set to music and circulated in military and academic circles. Not only is his poetry good, but his prose is also vigorous and sharp, with a great power to move people. This "Half Month" is a collection of Yi Junzuo's poems and prose that he makes every half month. It has now been published to the nineteenth issue. It has spread throughout Jiangsu Province, and with the passage of time, it has spread out of Jiangsu Province and has the potential to spread throughout the country. The popularity of a publication in an era is by no means accidental. From a purely literary point of view: Yi Junzuo's poems and prose in "Half Month" are all works of pure fire, and are loved and fascinated by all literati. From the point of view of the use of "Half Month" and society: it has three slogans: Approaching the masses, comforting the masses, and making public opinion daily spread; inspiring and encouraging readers and making the morale of scholars daily rise; singing heroes and praising martyrs to make the spirit of soldiers daily stronger.</p>
<p>Dear readers! Are public opinion, morale, and the spirit of soldiers what China needs most at present? Yi Junzuo is the first to fulfill his national duties and is determined to criticize the paralysis and paralysis of the national system. In this sense, the author's spirit is noble, radical, and enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Reading Yi Junzuo's poems is like Du Fu's pondering the Tianbao period, Lu You's grief and anger in reviving the country. In the hot and sluggish place, it is like reading Byron's "Ode to Greece". In the calm and vigorous place, it can be compared with the Hungarian patriotic poet Petőfi Sándor. Yi Junzuo's prose, recently mostly travel notes, depicts the beauty of the mountains and rivers, and increases people's love for the country and family. As the saying goes, "Seeing the scenery gives rise to feelings." The scenery seen by Yi Junzuo is all the most beautiful scenery in China, and the feelings expressed are also the most painful and sorrowful feelings in the face of the national crisis, with the most sorrowful feelings, integrated into the most beautiful scenery, his writing is desolate and distant, which should be appreciated by all pure-hearted people.</p>
<p>The author is humble and takes the liberty to introduce the "Half Month" to the people of the country: Publisher: Qingyunmen Xushulou Yi Residence, Zhenjiang; Distributor: Major bookstores across the country; Price: Six copper coins per issue, twenty issues throughout the year including postage of five cents.</p>
<h3>Xiaoxitian</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Three: Discussing loftily around the room and enthusiastically filing a lawsuit, forgetting old grievances for profit.</p>
<p>Only the man with the southern accent was heard saying: Don't dream. Even if the train takes another three years, it's still questionable whether it can reach Xi'an. It's a joke for you to rely on the present situation. It's no wonder you don't read newspapers at all, so you don't know the situation outside. Building a railway is not like building a car road, just digging the ground. It's about laying stones, sleepers, and steel rails. It will take tens of millions of construction funds from Tongguan to Xi'an. The section from Guanyintang to Tongguan is only that section of the road, and it took more than ten years to complete. Now that the train arrives in Tongguan is only a year. Do you think it can reach Xi'an immediately? The people who are buying land in Xi'an now are like betting treasures. If they guess right, they win. If they guess wrong, they have to give up. Like us, we are all big companies, and we have a lot of money to buy land. It doesn't matter if we lose it. If you don't sell it, I can find another one. Ten thousand silver dollars, don't regret it. After this set of words was said, the room next door was silent. Then the man with the southern accent coughed twice. After these few coughs, Jia Duocai was reminded of one thing. This person's surname is Jin, and he is preparing to open a packing company in Xi'an and Xianyang. Listening to his tone, he must be deceiving the local landlords to sell his land. He himself, entrusted by the bank, also has to buy two pieces of good land in these two places, and also plans to invest in the packing company. Now this Jin, in Shanghai, is very close to each other. Although he said that he was going to the Northwest to run a real estate, he didn't say when he would start. He didn't think he was sneaking here. He might as well try to win him over. He decided to suppress his temper and sit on the chair against the wall and listen. Then he heard the local saying that the land in Xi'an belongs to my family, so I don't have any difficulty. The land in Xianyang belongs to several surnames. My family can't make the decision. If you give me a discount again, I'll have to find another client. Jin said: Since that's the case, let's first do the land business in Xi'an. We'll discuss the land in Xianyang later. The local said: Sir, you are a smart person. Is there anything you don't understand? We are just waiting for money to spend, so we sold these two pieces of land at the same time. If we can sell one piece of land later, we will wait for two years. In any case, we can always get the interest for two years. (894)</p>

<h3>Feasting at the Butcher's Door</h3>
<p>— Shou Juan</p>
<p>Recently, when reading the newspaper, I especially like to read the news of Abyssinia's victory; whenever I see the Black Brothers regain a lost territory, I get so excited that I dance and stomp.</p>
<p>A friend ridiculed me and said: "You and the Black Brothers have nothing to do with each other, so why are you so nervous?"</p>
<p>I replied, quoting literature: "Feasting at the butcher's door, even if you don't get meat, you can still be happy."</p>
<h3>Scolding for Stealing Chickens</h3>
<p>— Zhecun</p>
<p>In the past, Lu Fangweng kept a female goose at home, but suddenly lost it. He once wrote a sentence saying: "I often worry that it will be caught by others when it flies low, why does it need to tell me where it went?" Fangweng can be said to be open-minded, with the intention of putting gains and losses aside. My fellow villager Yao Ye Tang, Mr. Yao Ye Tang, was honest and upright, and his poems were quite humorous. One day, he lost his family chicken, knowing that it was stolen by a neighbor, so he wrote a sentence: "I hurriedly taught the children to look for it for three days, and also learned from the village women to scold for a while." Reading it makes people laugh. I am a guest in Shanghai and have been a tutor for three years. On August 4th last autumn, I suddenly received the visit of a gentleman on the beam, who stole four pieces of summer clothes. The old cotton clothes were not taken. I also jokingly wrote a sentence: "I am ashamed of losing my bedding when guests come in the dark, and I am grateful for leaving the old green felt." I not only don't scold him, but also thank him.</p>
<h3>"That" Turns Out to Be a Pistol</h3>
<p>— Sun Linchang</p>
<p>The two words "that" have been discovered frequently in recent newspapers, with "that" appearing everywhere. When we look at it, we can't help but feel "that." Who knew that recently in Wuxi, a middle school student named Hua Yongxi got into trouble because of the indiscriminate use of "that." Originally, Hua Yongxi recently wrote a letter to a friend to borrow money because he was short of money. There were two sentences in it: "If you are not willing to save your brother from a difficult situation, please eat 'that' when you go out." Unexpectedly, the other party took Daoxin to report to the police station. Because the matter involved intimidation, Hua was detained and transferred to the court for prosecution. The prosecutor said very affirmatively in his indictment; "'That' refers to a pistol, which clearly has intimidation behavior..." It can also be said that it was because of the text that he brought disaster on himself.</p>
<h3>Sideline Talks</h3>
<h3>Discussion on the Abbreviation of National Currency</h3>
<p>— Chengming</p>
<p>Reading Xiao Chunqiu, Miss Zhenru's "Contributing a Small Opinion," briefly stated that "the two characters of national currency are always inconvenient to write, and it is proposed to use the abbreviation '巾'," etc. I express my support for this and it is very reasonable. National currency is paper currency, and the "幣" character follows "巾," just like "for example, using "羊" to replace "洋" and "長" to replace "銀" in the past." Since there are precedents that have been used in the past, it may as well be used after the new example is used. If only one "巾" character is used, is it too simple? You might as well use the "紙" character to represent "national currency," then the meaning of the two characters "national currency" is both. People in our business community have always been accustomed to using simplified characters, such as using "入洋" to replace "實洋" and "角" to replace "圓" and other characters, which are commonly used in ordinary ledgers and invoices. Ask the seniors in the business community, what do you think?</p>
<h3>Don't Talk Nonsense</h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>The new rules for submissions to this column have "Don't talk nonsense" as an agreement. Because of this meaning, I will write some precepts and hope to encourage each other with my fellow writers. If the words are sufficient, the merit lies in the country. As long as my tongue still exists, who will be silent? A careless word can easily lead to permission, or it is insincere, and it is shameful to open your mouth. Don't say that no one listens, from the inside to the outside, don't say it's a subtle word, accumulate small to large. Words cannot be verbose, and if they are verbose, they will be obscene. Words cannot be contemptuous, and if they are contemptuous, they will be insulting. If you lose your words, you can't catch up. Rather be a golden man to fulfill your duties. If there is an error in the words, the stain cannot be erased. It is difficult to know and act, so don't blame being alone. The Book of Changes says to keep your promise, and the Book of Songs says to settle your fate. Only then is it strict, only then is it cautious. Therefore, in seclusion, there is no sound, it is suitable for writing, harmonious and not arguing. People value exaggeration, but I keep my humility. People are skilled in rhetoric, but I hide my clumsiness. Prepare to spit and chew again, prepare to come out and stop again, be cautious and cautious, and be a gentleman. Preventing the people's mouths is more important than preventing rivers. Is it also possible to discuss horizontally? Therefore, hold your heart and be careful, publish it on the newspaper, and encourage each other.</p>

<h3>Harms of Masturbation</h3>

<p>Destroying the Gonads Leads to Spermatorrhea and Other Diseases</p>
<p>Masturbation is against physiology. Its harm is a hundred times greater than sexual intercourse. Some say that its harm is equal to starvation and bloodletting. This metaphor is extremely alarming to the general youth who are addicted to it.</p>

<h3>Records of Sex Disease Treatment</h3>
<p>— (Dr. Zhan Nianceng)</p>
<p>(1) Saving the Impotent with Electrical Waves and Medicine</p>
<p>Patient: Liang Yongxi, Guangdong native, 38 years old, in business. Mr. Liang was romantic and had many affairs. Excessive indulgence led to significant depletion, initially suffering from premature ejaculation, followed by impotence. Not only did his encounters become scattered, but he was met with scorn and ridicule. Even his youthful vigor vanished, prematurely aging. He experienced backaches, tinnitus, blurred vision, a sallow complexion, and exhaustion. Only last autumn did he, after much searching, come to me for treatment. Seeing the severity of Mr. Liang's condition, I administered electrical wave induction therapy while primarily using "Reproductive Essence" to treat the impotence and premature ejaculation caused by the weakening of his reproductive glands. After about a month, his symptoms disappeared. Since then, he has followed my advice to pay attention to his health, he says.</p>
<p>(2) Separating and Treating Nocturnal Emission and Premature Ejaculation</p>
<p>Patient: Wu Zhongguang, local, 25 years old, in the working class. Eight or nine years ago, Mr. Wu was led astray by bad friends and mistakenly engaged in masturbation, severely damaging himself in secret. Before marriage, he suffered from nocturnal emission, which remained untreated. After marriage, he suffered from premature ejaculation. This not only affected his ability to have children but also harmed his health. He resolved to seek treatment. Last summer, Mr. Ji Shi introduced him to me for diagnosis and treatment. I performed scientific surgical electrical wave therapy and prescribed "Schmid's" sperm-strengthening pills for his nocturnal emission and "Reproductive Essence" for his premature ejaculation and weakness. After taking several boxes, his symptoms were cured. I recently met him unintentionally at a factory. He mentioned that his wife was pregnant and repeatedly expressed his gratitude. He said the effectiveness of "Reproductive Essence" was truly unbelievable.</p>

<h3>Clinical Case Studies of Kidney Disease</h3>
<p>— Yao Erchang, Medical Doctor of the University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>
<p>Kidney Atrophy from Smoking and Wasted Youth</p>
<p>Patient: Liu Wenhuan, 40 years old, local, in business. Mr. Liu was congenitally weak. After marriage, due to a lack of moderation, he developed kidney atrophy, losing all vitality and becoming physically weak, with numerous complications and extreme suffering. Later, at a friend's place, he tried opium a few times and became addicted. Although he felt various inconveniences afterward, he could not quit. The kidney atrophy became more and more severe, practically non-existent. He tried various medications but could not cure the chronic disease, wasting time and suffering greatly. Last autumn, Mr. Yu Yiren introduced him to me for diagnosis and treatment. I explained the pathology and medical principles to him, and he realized that the previous medications were not suitable. He followed my advice and purchased "Reproductive Essence" from the Yong'an Company's Western medicine department. After about a month, the kidney atrophy was cured, and he became energetic. He unknowingly quit his smoking habit, he says.</p>
<p>Nocturnal Emission and Insomnia Causing Extreme Suffering</p>
<p>Patient: Gan Dacheng, 21 years old, from this province, in academia. Mr. Gan developed weakness of the reproductive system and relaxation of the seminal ducts due to mistakenly engaging in the bad habit of self-abuse. The following year, he developed nocturnal emission, insomnia, and forgetfulness, causing extreme suffering. The frequency of nocturnal emission increased, and his academic performance declined sharply. Treatment was ineffective, and his wedding was postponed. In early autumn last year, Mr. Shao, his landlord, introduced him to me for diagnosis and treatment. (Note: Mr. Shao had suffered from the same condition and was cured by me). I prescribed "Schmid's" sperm-strengthening pills and instructed him to purchase the reproductive gland preparation "Reproductive Essence" from the China-England Pharmacy. After about a month, his symptoms disappeared, and his body quickly recovered, becoming strong, muscular, and energetic, completely transforming him, he says.</p>

<h3>Stomach Pain is Not a Terminal Illness</h3>
<p>— Contribution from Wei Songbai</p>
<p>Treating Both the Symptoms and Root Cause of Long-Term Stomach Problems</p>
<p>(Above omitted) After suffering from stomach problems, I often experienced bouts of pain that were difficult to bear. I took many kinds of medicine, which only treated the symptoms temporarily and had to be taken regularly for a long time, almost becoming an addiction. (Middle omitted) I read in the 15th issue of this publication that Mr. Luo Huaiqing, who suffered from the same condition, was cured by treating both the symptoms and root cause with "Stomach Pain Relief" and "Stomach Strengthening Essence." I followed suit and purchased them from a nearby Chinese and Western pharmacy. After taking them, I felt that they were very different from ordinary stomach medicines. Not only did my stomach feel comfortable and strong, but my appetite also increased significantly. After taking several boxes, this previously thought to be incurable terminal illness was gone. The joy is greater than being "debt-free," he says.</p>

<p>(Chief Complaint) Backaches, sallow complexion, weak qi and blood, aversion to exertion.</p>
<p>(Medical History) Mr. Xiang was congenitally weak. He married early at the age of seventeen, which damaged his body before it could fully develop, leading to the decline of his reproductive glands.

Last autumn, Mr. Xiang Xinhua introduced him to me for diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>(Treatment) In addition to advising him on health maintenance methods, I instructed him to purchase "Reproductive Essence" from the China-France Pharmacy, two tablets three times a day.

After taking several boxes, his qi and blood were strong, and he was not tired even after heavy labor. His aged condition disappeared. He used to look like he was in his forties, but now he looks like he is in his early twenties, he says.</p>

<h3>Hitler and Bread</h3>
<p>— Fang Yin</p>
<p>January 13th marked the first anniversary of Germany's recovery of the Saar region. According to a Havas report, a passionate celebration was held there on that day. Fifteen thousand National Socialist Party veterans paraded in front of the German Front Square (formerly the City Hall Square). Subsequently, a grand gathering was held in the Waldburg Building. Saar Regional High Commissioner Buckel and German Interior Minister Frick both attended the meeting and delivered speeches. In his speech, Buckel said, "...We first read the prayer 'Give us bread' in the church, and then prayed: 'May God preserve our leader Hitler, so that our daily bread may no longer be stolen by others.'..." This statement is thought-provoking, and what strikes us is Buckel's comparison of bread with Hitler.</p>
<p>Since the German National Socialist Party came to power, we have never seen Hitler fulfill his promise of "Give us bread." The number of unemployed workers has not decreased, and to eliminate unemployment relief to expand armaments has made the lives of the unemployed even worse. Moreover, in recent years, due to the National Socialist government's intensified development of the arms industry, other domestic industries have fallen far behind, and food production has been greatly reduced. On the other hand, because the import of arms raw materials is far greater than the import of food, there is currently a food panic in the country. Although in November last year, German Economy Minister Schacht used "lack of butter" as a reason to prove the necessity of "obtaining new territories," this is just an excuse for imperialists to invade weak nations and divide the world, and it does nothing to help the German people themselves.</p>
<p>In recent years, the German National Socialist Party's autocracy and its brutal methods have made the people dare to be angry but not dare to speak. Hitler has not fulfilled his promise to give the people bread, but in the streets and squares, people are required to shout "Holy Hitler" everywhere! The phrase "Holy Hitler" has almost replaced all slogans and "Good morning" and "Good evening." Those who do not shout "Holy Hitler" are often severely punished. Now Buckel's speech mentions again that the German people should pray: "May God preserve our leader Hitler, so that our daily bread may no longer be stolen by others." Is it possible that when "preserving our leader Hitler" today, the German people's "daily bread" will be "preserved"? Moreover, many people have not received bread, so how can it be "stolen by others"?...</p>
<h3>The Heroic Spirits of Maicheng</h3>
<p>— Lin Hao</p>
<p>October night.</p>
<p>The sky is frighteningly dark, with no stars or moon, the sky is filled with black mist and a hint of rain; the wind is blowing incessantly, the sound of "whoosh whoosh whoosh" is like a tiger roaring, sometimes as majestic as waves crashing against cliffs, but sometimes it is sobbing and makes people cramp. The dead branches in the forest are completely bare, without any fallen leaves or fluff. When the wind blows, they sway and sing in a very strange and unfamiliar voice. A thin layer of silver frost has accumulated on the city wall, mottled with dark brown footprints. A lamp hangs high on the mast, swaying precariously, with the word "Gate" written on it, flickering with a pale green, faint light like a will-o'-the-wisp. Below, one can occasionally see a few patrolling soldiers. Their faces are almost as dark as ghosts, and their eyelids are gradually closing. They gather their strength and forcefully open their eyeballs, sleepily looking at their companions and the enemy's camp in the distance. Everyone reveals a look of exhaustion and depression; occasionally, a few bursts of snoring drift from the corners, very loud.</p>
<p>"Damn it, this lazy cow!" They say in their mouths, but their hearts are full of grievances: (The enemy has seized the key points, and food has been cut off for several days. Most of the soldiers have been injured or killed. They have to worry during the day and suffer so much at night. If it weren't for General Guan's virtuousness, hum! To be honest, no one could care about so much, and everyone would go their own way). The wind is cuttingly cold, and their stomachs are rumbling. There is no way to tighten their belts. Their whole bodies are shivering, and their upper teeth are clattering against their lower teeth. They feel for the hilt of their swords: "Damn it, let's just kill them all! It'll be over if we kill all these bastards!" But, thinking about our people, our stomachs... the boiling blood suddenly becomes as cold as ice. They clench their teeth and drag themselves back and forth on the city wall again, exhausted. Their hearts are troubled as if a thousand threads are entangled around them.</p>
<p>Seeing their thin, pale faces, I know that they have not had a good meal for several days; indeed, their food has been cut off for several days. General Liao has gone to Shangyong for help, but there is no news. In a few days, they will either die in battle or starve to death. Therefore, many have crossed the city walls to surrender. General Guan can't do anything either, and he just opens his phoenix eyes and curses Sun Quan every day: "Damn it, this green-eyed thief!"</p>
<p>The city wall is just a lifeless scene, shaking a few exhausted heads, occasionally flickering with the faint light of two or three handheld lanterns, with the dying wicks dancing faintly; the wind is blowing constantly, blowing, blowing.</p>
<p>In the distance, a group of people seems to be walking over. In the flickering light of the lanterns, one can see a familiar face, that is "Guan Yunchang," General Guan. A thin-faced soldier was the first to notice:</p>
<p>"Hey! General Guan is here!"</p>
<p>"Hey! You lazy pigs, General Guan is here!" Some kicked their companions who were dozing off in the corners.</p>
<p>"What! General Guan?" Startled from a dream, they yawned, rubbed their eyelids, and jumped up without thinking: "Ah! Is he bringing the reward wine?"</p>
<p>"Bah! You wish. Hum! Dreaming, you lazy pig!" The thin-faced man sneered: "Get up and walk around!"</p>
<p>"..." They lowered their heads and greeted them with several companions:</p>
<p>"Greetings, General Guan." The general kindly waved his hand and, together with Zhao Lei, Wang Fu, Zhou Cang, Guan Ping, and several others who came with him, patrolled the city and looked outwards: "You see, there seem to be fewer enemies outside the north gate. We are sure to break out from there."</p>
<p>"Yes." They replied in unison.</p>
<p>The surroundings are dark, and bats or eerie nine-headed birds and owls constantly flit over their heads, and the intermittent wailing almost breaks people's intestines. The general silently pondered for a long time, raised his head, and began a sad, apologetic prayer: (It is not because Guan is timid that he lost Maicheng, nor is it because Guan is afraid of death that he is going to Xichuan. In fact, Guan wants to reorganize his forces for a final battle. God! May you bless me to reach Xichuan safely)!</p>
<p>So, Yunchang led more than two hundred remnants of his troops, Guan Ping, Zhao Lei, etc., and broke out of the north gate, leaving only Zhou Hui and Wang Fu and more than a hundred soldiers in the city. Before leaving, Wang Fu cried sadly:</p>
<p>"We are holding this city to the death. Even if the city is broken, we will not betray the general and surrender. We hope that the general will come to rescue us soon! Take care! General."</p>
<p>More than twenty miles passed. It was a mountain depression, and suddenly hundreds of bright lights flickered out, the sound of drums constantly shook their eardrums, and people rushed over like tumbling mountains.</p>
<p>"Kill!"</p>
<p>"Kill!"</p>
<p>A surge of anger rose in their hearts, burning like fire, white knives, bright spears, shining sword blades, rows of halberds, iron strength, red blood, hot atmosphere, glaring fierce eyes, raised thick eyebrows, shining armor... In the dark mountain depression, under the lanterns that lit up the night like daylight, hundreds and thousands of strong men, like tigers, pounced and slashed, and the shouts echoed in the valley, making them even louder. Blood, like the water of the Yellow River, gurgled out of the constricted necks, shooting half the sky high, the horses, whinnying sadly, the bell sound constantly "ding ding ding" clearly vibrating in people's eardrums in the symphony of mutual death, and the sky seemed to be brightened by this loud cacophony.</p>
<p>Hands are chopped off, feet are cut off, heads fly into the air... At this time, it is not worth a moment's thought, and it is even more unthinkable to be surprised.</p>
<p>Yunchang wielded his knife, and saw that the enemy's troops were increasing. After a while, Zhao Lei's head fell into the chaotic army under the wave of the gleaming knife. Their hearts hurt as if they had been stabbed by thousands of knives, and Guan Ping and he desperately fought, but the soldiers were almost completely wiped out, but some surrendered.</p>
<p>Finally, they were captured by the enemy's attack.</p>
<p>The enemies all showed triumphant smiles, as if saying, "The peerless Guan Yunchang has also been caught by us," with such arrogance. In the distance, however, a few sporadic moans of dying wounded soldiers drifted by!</p>
<h3>News of Flowers from Home</h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>According to the lunar calendar, it is now the time of the end of winter and the beginning of spring. In my hometown in the Lingbiao area of the south, the east wind is fickle, and the feeling of the new spring is overflowing everywhere. Spring in Jiangnan comes later. The northern land is even more distant. Among the icy winds and hunting grasslands and forests, how can one smell the slightest breath of new spring. Although there are plenty of bright red and purple potted flowers in the flower shops, they are artificially cultivated and still have nothing to do with the natural seasons; even if you stand by the flower room, the feeling of spring is still very faint in the face of the purple, red, bright green; in the snow-covered suburbs, there is indeed plum to appreciate and pick, but they are still seen and regarded as unrelated to spring, and it is only because of the snow that people think of plum, and the value of plum is often increased by snow and wins people's love. The year I first came to Shanghai was after the Lantern Festival of the Lunar New Year. When I left home, the peach and plum trees in the garden behind the house had already bloomed. I thought that although Shanghai was colder than my hometown, it should be warmer at this time. But as a result, I was sitting in a yellow</p>
