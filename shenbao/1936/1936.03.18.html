<p>— 期</p>
<p>意大利自從去年十月發動東菲戰爭梭本想在一二星期內就征服了整個的阿此西尼亞可是為阿此西尼亞民族之英勇的抗戰覓給黑衫首相的侵略野心以極大的打擊意大利非但在軍事上沒有如所預期的順利地達到完全勝利的目的而在國際上反蒙了「侵略者」的罪名受國聯會五十餘國的經濟制裁使整個國家陷入極端孤立的狀態中更是這樣久持下去非但征服阿比西尼亞的希望沒有把握就是意大利的伕西斯蒂政權也將有被傾糧之虞不過最鈑德國的廢棄羅卡諾公的進兵萊因非武裝區域的行動卻給意大利以一個絕好的機會可以做一筆極好的買賣本旱期中在倫敦開會的國聯十三國委員會對於意阿紼和的辦怯當必有更進一步的擬議</p>
<p>阿此西尼亞在東菲戰事中所以能雊支持至半年之久一方面固然是由於阿國民眾之英勇的抗戰而另一方面卻是因為在國際上得到英國與愛好和平國家的稱助要是沒有這賽外來的援助東菲的侵略戰爭也許不會有這樣的持入英國的支持阿國抗意中耍的原因自然是在於意國獨吞阿國從將危害共地中海上的通路安全而並不是眞為弱小民簇的利益著想法國的參加對意制裁亦因為在國聯的義務下不能不選從國際的集體行動因為它是一向以擁護國聯及集體安全制度為共外交政策的基礎的而並不是由於意大利的侵略行動妨害了怯國的殖民地利益至共他國聯會員國的制裁意國雖然多出於擁護和平的誠意可是力量並不根大因為英法等帝國主義者的擁護國聯制裁意國都各有其自私的目的並不是眞正替弱小民族的利益著想因此瓜分阿國的和平建議就贗决提出來代替國聯之正義的行動去年賴伐爾與霍爾的和平建談忱是共中之最顯著者可是這種和平建議終因為愛好和平民眾的反對而流產了</p>
<p>不過到了最近德國的廢的行動已使國際形勢大形轉擲國聯的注意力已由地中海移轉到萊茵河上去而先前麥加對意制裁的法國導則正需要意大利的援助履行羅卡諾公的下的義務可是要想得到意大利的援助自然非予以交換的條件不可這就是說取消國聯對意的經濟制裁而在和平雞膳的面具下犧性阿國墨索里尼已經表示「意國願意屐行羅卡諾公的的雞務不過假使日內瓦要對德國制裁則因為意國自身受者制裁的威脅一時礙難同意」這已表明法國耍意國藷忙此非先行取消對意制戴不可吾則意大利非但不能履行羅卡諾公的下的義緘而貝還會站到德國一面去在這種情形下沃國為看自己的利益當然會接受意國的條件而英國也因為萊茵河問題比東菲戰事嚴重而遷枕意國因此這决的好買賣意國是准可做成了</p>
<p>從上面的觀察中我們可以看出帝國中義奢的對外政策都是為它們自己的利益著想的弱小民族要想得到澈底的解放還須靠若自己更大的努力與更央勇的鬥爭阿比西尼亞現在並沒有失敗非但軍事上遼可以支持而且在精神上也已獲得了猛大的勝利它為了它的前途一定還會有更光榮的鬥爭的</p>

<p>到塔爾寺去</p>
<p>西郵通訊</p>
<h3 id="c89">青海旅行記（續）　塔爾寺燈會 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>二月一日陰曆的初九，我們離開了有趣的桑思格，順著紅崖子溝而下，過了二十里的下寨，就是漢人的村落，當夜歇在赴西寗大道上的高寨。當地漢人的祖先，據說六朝時從南京珠子巷充軍來的。他們的講話：我音「奴」，很有松江府的韻味。</p>
<p>第二天很早到了西寗，承蒙馬步芳軍長的招待，一連在崑崙旅社住了四天，陰歷十叫的早上，他又派了一輛汽車及王處長王秘書，送甘肅于主席的代表張熙光處長同我們到塔爾寺去看燈會。</p>
<p>塔爾寺在西寧之南九十里，汽車出了南門，在冰河上拋了幾决錨。修好以後，駛上大路，沿途趕會的人，五光十色絡繹不絕。騎馬的也有，坐驕車的也有。汽車揚着塵幕前駛，沒有見過汽車的番馬，很多在路旁脫羈逃去；馬在前頭跑，車在後面駛，牠以爲是吃牠的野獸，牠就落荒的奔逃。幾只村狗，牠們也拚命的追着汽車，奔跑在吠，似乎在和汽車賽跑一樣。</p>
<p>五十里，汽車經過熱鬧的魯沙而市鎭，駛上山坡，雪白的帳房，下滿了山溝，嗚嗚的喇叭聲分　了人潮，汽車歇在高二八〇〇公尺的塔爾寺前面，由一位喇嘛引導我們在「小金瓦寺」後面的一所儈房中歇下。</p>
<p>謁班禪印象</p>
<p>時間還早，我們隨著以為　導的喇嘛，先去參謁班禪大師，大師的行轅，就在對面閃耀的紅墻中，順著山坡上去，沿路擠滿了紅衣的喇嘛，因為他　著今天受塔爾寺三千五百個喇嘛的朝拜。明天受人民的朝拜。現在他還沒有出殿，我們隨着引導的喇嘛擠進了大門，一個黃緞子的法座，巳設在院子的中央。</p>
<p>幾個紅頂子的堪布出來招待，到秘書處，我們都失　得很，預備朝大師而沒有帶一根哈達，絲帶藏人的見面禮。最後祗有用我們的名卡提上去。等了很久，我們和他的隨從閑談，知道大師定在陰歷二月底赴拉卜楞－甘肅夏河縣。四五月間纔取道玉樹德格回藏。</p>
<p>一個穿紫紅袍的翻譯，下來說「請」。我們一共九人，跟着他穿過院子，登上一段小梯，折進一間光錢黯淡的禪房。一位身披袈裟，臉色蒼老，留着鬍子，面現慈祥，的老者大師，迎了出來。吾們用漢禮鞠一惆躬，他很客氣的每人送上一根靑灰色的哈達，並且學着漢話招呼「請坐」，「請坐」。我們隨後由翻譯的轉述，請安。又互相寒暄了幾句。他因爲急於要出去，所以我們不能談着回藏的一切，臨別的時候，他又向大家握了一握手，此時發現他的臉部，比前年在南京見面時瘦削多了，大概因爲憂國憂時的關係吧？</p>
<p>聖陵的頂禮</p>
<p>走出行轅的大門，「大金瓦寺」房頂上的金瓦，向着我發光。一般傳說他的　值，相等於庚子賠狄，所以我們多很注意，屋頂分上下兩層，仿宮殿式，中間圍上一轉六字眞言的布簾。屋脊的正中，裝着三個金頂，美麗的瓦片，向着觀衆射出不可這視的黃色光芒。至於牠是吾全金，或是溜金，那就不暇深究了。</p>
<p>寺週的墻脚下，擠滿了瞌長頭的蒙藏人民，爭先恐後用五體投地去測量寺的週圍。旁邊是一所轉經的房子，一排「嘛呢輪」不息的在旋轉，推動的人排緊得沒有空隙，有時甚至於二個人同時推一個輪軸。</p>
<p>喇嘛引着我們進寺中去頂禮「聖陵」！入鬥的地板上，被一般　頭的佛徒磨成了很深的糟子，打開大門，走進崇閎肅穆的大殿，這裏藏着「黃敎祖師」宗喀巴的肉身。所以大金瓦寺在喇嘛敎中，更有無上的價值。聖陵中的光綫異常的黑黯，從酥油燈的光亮中發現一個高大的塔子，塔的四壁掛滿了精細美麗的神帳。佛　。</p>
<p>走出寺門的左手，有一棵木欄圍着的枯樹，幹枝散漫。喇嘛指着說「宗喀巴」的胞衣，埋在此地。所以長起這一株菩提樹。同時我們在一根新枝上，發現有幾個黃色的藏文字母，他的筆劃彷彿虫蛀的一樣，這多是宗喀巴的靈蹟。幾個虔誠的番婆，她們就用頭在木欄上碰了一下，表示着頂禮的意思。</p>

<p>— 趙君豪</p>
<p>（本報記者旅行通信）</p>
<p>自衡陽至郴州坪石</p>
<p>八日晨，余等乘株韶局工程汽車離衡陽，向耒陽郴州進發，而以坪石爲終點，鐵道部督工專員周夏聶三君同行，彼等蓋均赴郴州督工者也。自衡陽至郴州，原已通車，惟以路軌初成，車行稍緩，須至薄暮，始可行抵郴州，余等以規定行程，必須於今日馳抵坪石，故以工程汽車仍循湘省公路前進。白衡陽出發後，地漸向南，氣候較暖，兼之今日天公已放晴光，車中乃大爲舒適。途中時見鐵路綫橫過公路路錢，蓋公路可隨地勢曲折，而鐵路則注重截灣取直，不能過於灣曲也。車過耒陽，未及停車，仍繼續前進，的中午抵郴州。</p>
<p>梆州爲湘南大邑，以接近粤省，峯巒重疊，地方向稱不靖，共匪朱毛，最先亦發難於此，現已歸順中央之李宗保，在紅軍中向極著名，聞亦係郴州人。余等在公路車站下車後，卽先至株韶局第四工程總段，晤總工程司劉寶善君，鐵部三專員，即暫駐於此。在段午膳後，卽由此　工程員譚議君導余等出游郴州古跡，頗多價值，有三絕碑，係秦少游作詞，米南宮所畫，蘇子由所刻，故稱三絕，碑文漫遺，非細加審覽，對證古書，實難辨識。　譚君言，渠與郴州中學校長某君善，得知原文，亟鈔錄如下：</p>
<p>霧失樓臺，月迷津渡，桃源望斷知何處？可堪孤館閉春寒，杜鵑盤裏殘陽樹。</p>
<p>驛寄梅花，魚傳尺素，砌成此恨無重數。郴水本自繞郴山，爲誰流下瀟湘去。</p>
<p>此外有蘇仙亭，其掌故詳載今古奇觀，大致係蘇耽之母感仙孕而生耽，耽旣長，跨鶴仙去，至今亭上有神仙石，石上猶有鶴之爪印。又有橘井觀，謂蘇耽之母將死，遺言郴州明年必大疫，如以橘葉取井中之水飲之必可解，後其言果騐，今井址尙存，醫家所常用之「橘井」二字，實發源於此云。除上述者外，更有義帝墓，爲漢高祖與項羽故事。義魚亭爲韓愈南謫過郴時故事。凡上所言，類多神話，然郴州有久遠之歷史，自不待言矣。郴縣縣府，頗與鐵路合作，且請工段爲地方計劃馬路，一係沿山而築者，一係貫通城區者，其貫通城區之馬路，且與郴資公路相啣接，今一切正在力疾進行之中。</p>
<p>郴州又有一溫泉，距車站的六華里，余等以猶有餘暇，更倩譚君爲導，作溫泉之游。此泉聞係譚延閱氏所發現，在長沙時嘗至此沐浴。余等仍以汽車行二十分鐘，下車後更步行二十分鐘卽至，泉在一小山之麓，終年汨汨不絕，水微溫，含鑛質甚富，惟設備甚屬簡陋，浴池作方形，且爲露天，上蓋瓦屋，四周繚以短垣，余等至時，有鄉民十餘人，正裸體磅磚，狀甚不雅，嗣經路警勸令退出，始得至池旁詳爲觀覽。泉流恐僅一支，惟水勢甚旺，余試以手探之，水溫似與南京之湯山溫泉相仿。路局現正計劃自車站闢一馬路至此，四周嘉樹葱蘢，環境尙稱不惡，果再加以經營，設置精美浴盆，則郴州一地，藉此溫泉與上述之名勝，必可吸收不少游客也。</p>
<p>游溫泉後，仍乘原車前進，此時車已駛行山上，坡度極陡，因湘粤邊境，山嶺極多，公路蓋隨山勢爲轉移也。午後四時，過宜章，見路旁有大道，亟停車往觀，大道甚爲寬闊，均鋪極整齊之石板，兩旁古松成行，枝葉蒼翠，一望無際，以意度之，非一二百年，决不能植此古松，最可異者，此種植樹鋪路之方法，與現代都市設計，絕無二致，可見中國古代建築之文明，實足令人矜式。聞車夫言，此大道名郴州大道，可自郴州直通宜章，惟大道之歷史，尙有待於查考，旅中無可寫吿也。自此一路以下，風光愈好，途中挑鹽擔北去者絡繹不絕，先後何止數百人，均係自粤省販鹽入湘者。車更前行，過小塘站後，卽爲粤省之境界矣。粤省公路奇陡，路隨山轉，盤旋往復，成一大環，車幾在山頂上行駛，俯視左右，則小山都在足下，若非車夫調度得宜，必多危險。入粤境後，行駛未久，卽至坪石，株韶局第三工程總段所在地也，辦公房屋，建在小山之上，遠望靑峯片片，風景極盡天然之美，是晚卽宿於工段。</p>

<h3 id="c154">上海之魚鮮業　（上海工商業槪况之十八） <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>一　上海魚鮮業之地位魚行（註）曁衡源愼記魚行於去年春相繼收歇</p>
<p>據一般估計，上海每年之魚鮮貿易。（一部份爲鹹魚海味），當全盛時期，嘗超出六千萬元以上，近年市塲衰落，亦達一千五六百萬元之鉅，上海魚市之重要於此可以洞見。考其原因，實有兩端：一爲上海有三百四十餘萬人，需要巨大；一爲地臨海濱江口，居魚鮮集散之總匯，如吳興，崑山，吳江等縣之養殖魚，沿江各縣之江鮮魚，浙江沿海各地（如鄞縣定海等縣）及山東沿海各區（如靑島，威海衛等處）之冰鮮魚及鹹乾魚，皆以上海爲其銷售之尾閭，至本埠漁輪所捕獲之魚鮮，則更全部求售於本埠市塲。故上海成爲全國唯一之魚市，實非偶然也。</p>
<p>二　上海之魚行及漁輪</p>
<p>公司　上海旣為魚鮮之集散總滙，故有專業行商，代客買賣，從中取相當之佣金。因歷史與地點關係，經營是業者皆會集於十六舖小東門一帶，內計冰鮮魚行一十餘家，淡水魚行五六家，兼營者尚不與焉。此外尚有鹹魚行三十餘家，海味行（連兼者在內）五十餘家。惟每年營業最多者爲冰鮮魚行，淡水魚行次之。</p>
<p>近年來社會經濟不景氣，各業皆受影響，魚行，）赤非例外。按去年一年而論，如洽豐發記魚行（註一）暨衡源愼記魚行於去年春相繼收歇，公大魚行（註二）暨源通興記魚行，叉於同年七月間宜告淸理，凡此皆足證經營冰鮮魚業之困難。但就大體觀察，該業仍能維持相當盈餘也。</p>
<p>註一：洽豐發記於春間收歇後，會力謀復業，於同年十二月間即告實現，將原來之合夥經營改爲有限公司性質，改發記爲衡記，資本分三百股，每股一百元，共計三萬元，當收足叫分之三，經理爲張順根（原爲陸錦棠），監督爲張筱初云。</p>
<p>註二：公大亦於同月復業，改稱公大忠記，資本定爲一萬八千元，分作十二股，股東爲蔣阿順，周永炤，施阿榮等，經理即推施阿榮負責。</p>
<p>至十六舖小東門一帶之鹹魚行，去年營業雖亦較往年减少十分之二三，但因營業審愼，不吃倒賬，均有盈餘，今亦附記於後，以備參考。。</p>
<p>本埠除各魚行販賣魚鮮而外，尚有漁輪公司經營捕魚。圪上海之有漁輪業，迄今的有三十餘年之歷史，內有手操網漁輪與拖網漁輪兩種，今將其現狀分項列表於後：</p>
<p>註。。自興華至海利八家爲拖網漁輪，春興以後之七家爲手操網漁輪。前記十五家中，除集熒爲厦門集美水產學校獨資創辦之實騐輪外，餘均爲合資公司組織。興華係接盤前中華漁業公司改組而成</p>
<p>從前表觀察，我人可得二概念，一爲本埠現存之漁輪業，皆爲近年新起者，二爲資本額及漁輪噸數皆極微小，由是可知日本漁輪得在我國沿海侵捕，除一般政治關係外，亦實有其經濟上之條件，此吾人所不應忽視者也。</p>

<p>— Louisa　M．Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>一晚的歡娛，最後殿以全部年靑人的大游行，開頭就是那南瓜車子，中間坐着改裝了的灰娘和御者，前面的四大老鼠奔跑跳躍得要發在了。</p>
<p>當孩子們在欣賞這最後一次的嬉戲時，大人們坐在客窒裹一面看着，一面在以家長和朋友的興味，談論着這些小孩子。</p>
<p>「你在那邊獨自個兒想什麽，臉上倒有一副快樂的神氣，蜀姊姊」？勞笠問道，他正將身子坐落在一個蘇乏上，貼近她的身旁。</p>
<p>她讓他一點地位，又笑嘻嘻回答道：『坦第，我夏天的工作，幷且在設想我的童子們的將來，倒也覺得有趣的。』</p>
<p>『他們都要成就了詩人，畫家，，政治家，有名的軍事家，或者至少也是實業領袖，我推想。』</p>
<p>『不，我並不如以前，我曾有過的那麼奢望，我想假如他們是誠實的人我已心滿意足了。不過我也願承認我確對於裏面的幾個懷抱着一些榮譽和較遠大的前途。小橋不是一個尋常的孩子，我想他要秀發到眞正美好與偉大的人格，別的也可有相當的成就，我希望，特別是我最近收來的兩個童子，因爲今晚聽到到了乃德的奏藝，我想他是有天才的。』</p>

<p>堪輿學術，流傳到現今已經很久。稱呼善於堪輿術的人，大概都喚做「地理家」，或是「風水先生」，但是關於地理，風水，究竟和活人死人有什麽禍福的關係，似乎有不可思議的神秘。</p>
<p>據說紹興籍的三主席之一商啟予（震）氏，有祖墳在保定的浙江義地，這墳從安葬到現今已經有數十年了，並且未會修理過一决，可是望去竟然還是和新葬的一樣，連土色也不變。一到了春夏時期，便顯得卓色靑葱，油然可愛。然而在那義地中墳墓很多，都互相連接着，不過倒的已倒，塌的已塌，沒有一個能像商氏祖墳這樣經數十年不變的。所以有風水先生說；這墳恰在地的落脈處，鍾靈毓秀，前途方興未艾。如此說來，風水的道理豈眞値得相信？</p>
<p>還有馮玉祥氏也有祖墳在保定，年前遷葬南方的時候，掘開泥土，便見熱氣蒸騰，紫籐繞滿在棺木的四週，而且棺木也和新的一樣。用刀割斷籐枝，籐枝都流出白汁。據識風水的人說；這裏是一處好風水，可惜被馮氏破了。須知馮玉祥素來不喜迷信，在他祖墳遷葬後，並沒遭遇什麼禍難，而且現今還是黨國的要人。那末所謂風水，似叉不可信了。</p>
<h3 id="c204">五號出店 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>近來，我們公司裏，從漢口分公司中，調來了一位會計部主任。大家在背地裏，却都紛紛地呼之爲「五號出店」。我覺得很是奇怪，用心一打聽，才知這個所謂「五號出店」，却是很有來歷的。</p>
<p>那大的還是在七年之前吧，他還是在某洋行中，充當一個出店。那時他已是三十餘歲了，每月只掙得二十元左右的薪水，一家的生活，自然是非常困苦的，所以他的一個妹子，便給他押在北里中。可巧那時，那洋行中的買辦，涉足花叢，一見傾心，和酒報效無虛夕。但初猶不知道個意中人，就是行中五號出店的妹子呢。這麽着厮混了一陣，二入竟訂了嚙臂之盟，由買辦出資，給脫了花籍，而列作小星，擅專房之寵。五號出店因恐自己的地位影響於妹子的恩寵，所以兄妹倆，相的着對着買辦守秘密。但從此五號出店的家庭經濟，自然是逐漸好轉了。</p>
<p>這麽着二月餘，也是合該有事一天，五號出店上妹子家去，正遇買辦也在那裏。一經盤問，兄妹倆無法隱瞞，只得和盤托出。過了二天，出乎意外的，五號出店，竟被擢升爲「寫字」，而同時，買辦還命他晚上進夜校讀書。二年之後，因他的用功苦讀，學業大進，而同時，他因出身微賤，頗爲同事所蔑視，頗有去志，於是買辦便把他薦往我現在服務的公司中當賬務員。這公司，是買辦任着董事的，同時，買辦的見子，還任着協理，所以是十分有招呼。</p>
<p>一年之後，買辦的見子，看中了他的一個十五歲的女兒了，他便很知趣的把女見送給了他當外室。於是，接着，便被派往漢口分公司，當賬務主任。一直到去年秋間，才調回來，當總公司的賬務主任，月支薪水二百五十元。</p>
<p>這位賬務主任，人是挺精明强幹的，而且也很忠於職守，所以大家對於他，倒也並無甚麼惡感。但是一般人，熟知他的掌故的，却總是愛在背地裏，用「五號出店」四字，代表着他的尊姓大名。</p>
<h3 id="c205">狗的墳墓 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 何家樂</p>
<p>一二月前上海發現了狗學校，轟動一時；因爲在中國，狗的保護素來不大注意的緣故。在美國赫斯特爾地方，早有關於狗的特殊的設備；就是在一八九六年的時候；建築了一個富麗堂皇的公墓。和普通人類的公墓一樣；某家一頭愛狗死了的時候；也須買一具棺材；據說最玫究的棺材耍費二百金鎊。最普通的也要一二十鎊。送進公墓安葬以後，也免不了要立一塊石碑，寫明狗的名字，和安葬的年月，有的竟然還要刻上「墓誌銘」。</p>
<p>在這赫斯特爾的狗公墓里：有一頭狗，在生前因爲是參加歐戰而在前錢上陣亡的；所以特地造了一個銅像；矗立天空，傲視一切。下面墓碑上刻着「爲國犧牲的戰犬」七個大字。每逢忌日，總有許多人拿了花圈去致祭。</p>
<p>有人說：「寗作太平狗，不做亂世人！」言詞之間，倒有些羨慕黃金國度裏的畜生呢。</p>

<p>成先生却矮小一點，沒有鬍子，但是黃黑的面皮，禿着一颗圓頭，也是神氣很足的。郭卓然道首先握住了志的手導：周縣長說，程先生願意加入我們這團體，我們十分歡迎，决計把行期展長半年。志前笑道：這就不敢當了。我上决西行，只到蘭州爲止，是不無遺憾的。聽了人說，眞要看西方的情形，非出玉門關不可，因之我遲留在西安，不進不退的，就是等着這樣一個機會。現在有了你二位組織旅行團到西邊去，那正是完全適合了我的意思。郭卓然直待他把話說完，方才放開了手。坐到一邊去，向志前點頭笑道：我一聽到周縣長說，程先生楚到過一决甘肅的，我們就非常歡迎。因爲不楚旅行趣味十分濃厚的人，他不能第一决冉向那邊去。上一次我們由寗夏那條路到迪化，只覺得那不過是新疆的一角，不能算是認識了新疆，這一决我們重新西去，是預備向南疆走。志前十分高興，彷彿心裏頭那種痛快，無法可以表示出來，只是坐在一邊，把兩隻手不住的搓着。成石公笑道：看程先生這情形，實在是我們一個同志。聽說程先生願意到靑海去，我們一定可以奉陪。聽說甘肅西南角，還有個拉卜楞族，我們也打算去看看。志前道：我在蘭州，遇見過這一族人的，穿了紫色布的皮襖，袖子長到三尺多，衣長也只有三尺多，頭戴尖頂帽子，倒有些像戲台上的皂班。一雙高腰靴子，高平了膝蓋。但是他們很强健，都能跑馬打槍，成石公笑道：談到人民的模樣，是新疆最有意味了。看到纏回，我們誤認是印度人。看到南疆回人，我們誤認是土耳其人，其實是我們同胞。一個人只要不辜負這兩隻腿，字宙裏面，到處楚知識的寳庫，只怕我們自己不肯去尋找。志前拍了兩腿笑道：別什麼，我不敢自負，若說這兩條腿，那倒是相當結實的。（四一七）</p>

<h3 id="c207">浦江之渡 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 黄克威</p>
<p>像秋天的洛葉似的，在黃浦江的濁流上，巨大的軍艦商　下，一片片，一片片悄悄地漂流着。</p>
<p>每天，每天，從早晨到夜晚，冒着迷離的烟霧，和着嘹亮的汽笛，輕輕地搖起了伊啞的木檐，　着滿船的人，打浦東到浦西，浦四到浦東，那麽不停地往來着掙取一些微薄的渡資。</p>
<p>他們是生活在水上的，黃浦江對於他們是多麽熟悉而又親熱呵！</p>
<p>也許由於好奇心的衡動吧，有一决從朋友家回來，特地坐着小舢板撬到沛西，做一種新鮮的帶點刺激味的嘗試。</p>
<p>正是早春的下午，太陽明朗地把江水塗上了一層金色，微波燦爛地閃耀着，水珠在櫓板上濺起來，像許多細碎的透明的珍珠。</p>
<p>在這浩蕩的江面上，坐在這樣一隻小渡船，自身眞覺得太渺小，而江面郤更感到非常廣闊了！當有一隻輪船駛過時，船就劇烈地顚簸起來，一上一下震蕩，神經上小小受了一點恐怖的刺激。</p>
<p>搖船的是一個五十多歲的老年人，雖然臉上已刻劃了許多生活磨煉出來的縐紋，顯得很蒼老，但精神郤很飽滿，搖船也非常有勁。在這發分鐘短短的水程上，在瀏覽沛東景色之中，我無意地問了他一句：</p>
<p>「你一天能搖多少錢呵」？</p>
<p>「至多也只有一千多錢，有時候連幾百文都掙不到手」！</p>
<p>他說話的聲調裏隱藏着一個悠長的嘆息，但是沒有吐出來，祗把苦笑的神精表示他內心的苦悶！</p>
<p>一隻太古公司的小火輪正從對面雄壯地駛了過來，船上擠滿了人，他忽然又輕輕地說道：　　「像這種公司船又快又穩，又不要錢，自然乘的人多了，吾們生意都給搶大了」！</p>
<p>這時，船又劇烈地震蕩起來，我悵然望着那些擠滿客人的公司船，深深地感到道些小渡船正是在顚簛的江流上掙扎呵！</p>
<p>遊踪所至</p>
<h3 id="c208">踏雪訪梅記 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 霞飛</p>
<p>梅花在故鄉洞庭西山，本來原不値什麽希奇，因爲我們的屋子差不多也建築在梅林裹的，只要推開門去，抬頭就是那潔白可愛的梅花；有時甚至一兩里路啣接着都是梅林，我們在林下小徑裏行着，也不會讓我望見一片天空的。可是今年我返鄉時，雖已是看梅的季節，但爲了天氣陰寒之故，所以各處的梅花還祇含苞着，並且在十天半月中也不會像開放的樣子。</p>
<p>一星期後，天氣突然加倍寒冷了，這寒冷的程度實在有點兒彷彿似三九嚴冬；並且從晚上起，天空中竟然會飄起鵝掌般大的雪片來，整整一夜沒有住。第一天早晨我開門出去一望，只見許多屋上，樹上，地上，全已積下了一厚層的白雪，睜開眼來，自己好像置身一個粉裝玉築的世界裏面；就是前面的四龍山，鷄籠山，下面的林屋山，上面的八砲嶺，背後的毛公塢，也已披上了一襲白衣。</p>
<p>在這樣一個偉觀美麗的景緻裹，附近的梅花還是酣睡着沒有醒來，於是自已祇得捨近求遠，到包山去踏雪訪梅了。因爲那兒地位向陽，朝陽山上的梅花照例是要先開一個月的。</p>
<p>我和雄兩個人。在一個淡淡的陽光照射着大地的午後，走上了常山路，循着和尚們的芒鞋痕跡，過了紅山門，從背陰山翻過去，便到了朝陽澗畔。</p>
<p>我在梅叢中走着，偶然觸及梅條，那雪花和梅瓣便簌簌地跌在髮上衣上；然而我却不忍將道些積雪和梅瓣拂去，願意它永遠留在我的髮際，留在我的衣袂。</p>
<p>皮鞋在雪面上走着，很是容易滑跌的，雄當時就在山坡上，跨過一塊大石的時候摔了一交。我因爲前車可濫，所以行路特別小心，每換一步，總是攀住那些小樹幹的。</p>
<p>朝陽週裏，溪流琤淙，澗水是淸澈可愛的，澗底一些小圓石子也都歷歷可數，山坡上那片靑葱蒼翠的松林裏，送來那雄壯的松濤聲，山中一些野花的幽香，雖然壓在雪下，它們還是一陣陣地在　送着。</p>
<p>雄倚在一株老梅樹下對我說：「可惜我們沒帶得快鏡來，不然大可攝幾張雪景梅花回去留作紀念呢！」</p>
<p>那時我正繞着那片梅林在走着，望着道一片銀白的梅花，心裏也好像一塵不染的快活得了不得，雖則在春寒料峭，西北風橫掃中，可是我終於爬上了那座不十分崇高的山麓，縱覽四方的梅花；找到了一株奇幹橫枝的梅樹下，我就在一塊岩石上坐了下來，無言默默地仰視着樹頂。漾起了無限的悵惘與感槪！想自家爲了生活，半生飄泊，十載淪洛，可是每决歸來時山水似舊，而人事屢更，疇昔故人，　年伴侶，都已不復可得，只有這一片梅林還能使我憑吊一下童年的殘跡；然而靑春已逝，心境已非，這也不過徒使再來人感慨係之而已！</p>
<p>「隔斷紅塵三千里，這天仙般的姿質，淸高不俗的品性，多麽地令人可愛呵一！我正在沉思的時候，却給雄幾句唱詩似的詵讚詞喚醒了。</p>

<h3 id="c220">禁舞重議 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 史楫</p>
<p>第一特區市聯會又在「以肅風化，而維社會治安」的重申前議呈請市政府取締跳舞塲了。</p>
<p>「呈請取締」的理由，還是和從前提出的相同：「瀝陳弊害四端，先施限制兩項。」</p>
<p>市聯會諸公的能關心於「社會安寗，及整個國家民族之前途，」因而對「乃今滬上舞塲營業，畸形發展，每晚吸引男女靑年，通宵達旦，狂歌歡舞，放浪淫逸，達於極點」表示看不慣而呈請取締，原是値得擁護的。不過在擁護之後，我們却不能無言。</p>
<p>從第一次呈請取締到現在第二次呈請取締之間，這幾個月來，跳舞塲已經有了很大的變遷了：第一，一元八跳十跳的小舞塲雨後春筍似的開出來；第二，各舞塲競以「艷舞」，「大會」，以及「神秘表演」之類的名稱來拉攏舞客　第三，延長時間，「晚舞」之外，又有「茶舞」，而為了競爭起見，還「奉送精美茶點」；第四，這些之外，最近「畸形發展」得更厲害的，是名為跳舞學校或舞藝研究社而實為變相的更廉價的小舞塲的興起，這些跳舞學校裏的舞客，大都是一般商店的小職員，從這些現象看來，我們可以看出，跳舞這件事，已經是從紳士淑女，富室少年而流入於市民層了。不過，在這跳舞普遍地成為一般市民嗜好的現在，我們試一留心於舞塲的情况，則又可以發現兩伴事情，就是：舞塲裏坐着不跳的所謂「拆字攤」，較之於跳的舞客要多過許多，而新的舞塲的典起，雖似雨後春筍，而關門大吉的也是前仆後繼。</p>
<p>從上面的事實中，我們也能看出跳舞塲的「每况愈下」的景况來，何以跳舞塲的景况是每况愈下，而又深入於市民層呢？我們祗要細細地想一想，便知道這是並非無因的。中國現在是個苦悶的時代，為了受不住這悶熱的煎熬者，便走到頹廢的慢性自殺的路上去。例如不久之前請願回來的學生，便有許多在車上誓言以後將於歌塲舞榭中了此一生的。</p>
<p>這僅是一例　再譬如同日報上的一位「曾一度留學法國」的靑年，被跳舞塲主控吿濫發支票，便因為「回國後賦閒在家」。在這社會中的靑年，不是懦弱的慢性自殺，便是堅强的「挺而走險」！</p>
<p>頭病醫頭，脚痛醫脚的辦法是祗有庸醫於無可奈何時纔想出來的；何况這還是「頭痛斬頭」的辦法！</p>
<p>至於禁舞後的舞女及附庸於舞塲為生者的出路問題，那還在其次。</p>
<h3 id="c221">起程 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>—還鄉苦雪之五</p>
<p>這一條長列，蛇樣的臥在雪地裏，除了首車以外，其餘都是沒有頂的。所謂首車，並不像普通的客車，如果在京滬綫上，只不過是一段行李車而已。</p>
<p>當然，牠是不會有什麽窗子的，兩個鐵門分開在車子的兩端，裏面是一大間統廂呵！</p>
<p>於是，我們把蓆子拉開，釘在上面的鐵板上，對面，也採取同一的方式，僅僅地，留一個長方形的洞口預備着進出。這樣，那大的統廂，是分隔成了三間，靠南面的，被我們這一夥佔住了，那一面是幾個塲地的隨從，還有，當中的這一間甬道呢？幾位落難的不知名姓的朋友，在一種哀感的情形下也搬了上來。</p>
<p>午飯後，各人的箱籃都送上了車，餘剩的蓆子像地氈一樣平鋪在鐵板上，行李，不分什麽决序的攤開，把箱子都堆在一角上，疊得高高地。</p>
<p>天，眞短，黑了，張順走過來，把煤油燈燃着了，順便的問了句要不要吃什麼，一轉身，又走去了。</p>
<p>—過來！老裘喊住他：看一下，水够麼？吃的乾糖要多預備點，留神在路上說不定要躭擱呢！</p>
<p>不知怎麽，我們總覺得老裘的臉色有點不大好看，彷彿有憂盧的事。</p>
<p>—今天到底能開麽？小魏在平靜的空氣裏劃了一句。</p>
<p>—九點開，他看着錶：等着吧，還有三個鐘頭。</p>
<p>聽聽，前面的車頭拉出了響聲，跟着，車子也有點動了。許是孤苦的老母在期待着游子的回旋吧？那響聲里帶過來輕微的音訊，我將以什麼來安慰她的心呢？辛酸，從心底深處直躥到鼻管，捺不住這苦痛的悲愁，我落着淚，但不敢給旁的人看見，讓頭埋在被筒裏，呵，在一個拜受別人恩賜的毛孩子的身上，怎能不防備他們忌諱這不幸的動作呢！</p>
<p>—各位，有一句話是要聲明的，裘老同着甬道裏的人說：坐車是不生問題的，但，倘若在路上出了毛病，或者遭遇到檢查，這責任……</p>
<p>許多的眼睛看着老裘，思索着，他們都不說話。自然，他們又能說什麽呢？寄托在他人的籬下，須要那春風的施與，恐慌，那簡直是不可能的在鋼絲繩上動盪着的生物，與其遭受着恐慌的襲擊　不如去犬膽碰一下的，他們和我具有同一的命運呵！</p>
<p>快了，輪子壓着鐵軌上的薄泳，天氣冷得使人不能伸手。</p>
<p>—但願這一去能够不出亂子，安穩的回到天津吧！</p>

<p>十三日羅迦諾公約簽字國　在倫敦會議，英外相張伯倫先出外，面露憂色，掌　大臣哈利法克斯勳爵，與意國大使格蘭第，接踵而出，亦有　容。譚老三曰，這次會議，一定愁雲慘霧，滿佈會塲，情形十分難過，決不像開跳舞會觀　會等之寫意矣，何也，「看人挑担不吃力，自上肩頭嘴欲歪。」</p>
<p>故宮坤寗宮旁，有廂房三間，　閉甚嚴，從未開啓，卽溥儀出宮時，組織故宮保管委員會，亦未點騐，故宮淸册上，亦未載此房古物，譚老三曰，此足見故宮委員會委員辦事之認眞矣。</p>

<p>楊廣以前的待經上就有「昔我往兮楊柳依依」的句子，那末楊柳這名字「由來久矣」。自然據詳於各物訓詁的人說來，「楊」「柳」本來是兩種樹。所以「昔我往兮楊柳依依」底下就是「今我來思雨雪霏霏」，雨和雪就是兩種東西，這自然也對的；但是當時的詩人是不是也和後來一樣講對仗工，我們還不得而知，何况「雨雪」兩字更有，作下雪講呢？</p>
<p>雖則如此，而在我們鄕下楊和柳却的的確確是兩種樹，柳是下垂的，而楊却上伸，自然有人說楊樹倒栽，就成垂楊，但據實騐幷不確實。</p>
<p>在一切樹木中，（長綠樹餘外）楊柳是最足以做着春的特徵的，因為春天一到，牠就最先發芽，而一到春深，牠也就穠然暗綠了。就因為這樣，上邊所說的詩人就把牠當作春天的代表，他說「楊柳依依」來暗示着春天，到後來却連無可奈何的春去也希望柳條來牽繫了。</p>
<p>楊柳大概本來是南方的產物，「樹猶如此人何以堪」所謂「如此」之樹，就是漢南之柳，因此到老殘的游記，描寫濟南風景，還說「家家泉水，戶戶垂楊，彷彿江南」。</p>
<p>楊柳在一切樹木中，又是最易長大的一種，凡是易長大的一定不堅固。所以「蒲柳之姿望柳先零」拿柳怎然和草本的蒲幷稱，古人有言「十年樹木」，我想十年有成的大概也只有柳樹，至少松柏楡楠之流，是非三四十年不可的。我們鄕下，更有諺云「柳樹成國暴發戶」，說一家宅旁只是柳樹成圍，一定是暴發戶，因為假使是積世財主，那一定楡楠成圍了。</p>
<p>「江南臨水之處多種之」這是一句有各的關於楊柳的說明，其實不一定臨水之處可種，牠是隨處可以種的，因為他長成容易，故亭邊橋畔隨在都是。古人別離大都是陸行在亭邊，水行在橋畔，當時舉頭一望，就看到柳樹，於是一伸手就折下些柳條來贈別，或則是完全無意，或則是忘記了馬鞭而作代用品。總之，因為離別時接觸得多，楊樹就隱隱成了象徵難別的東西，例子自然舉不勝舉的。</p>
<p>楊柳是垂綠的，牠的好處是在搖曳生姿，而恰恰女子的腰也以纎細而搖曳生姿者為佳，於是詩人們就更把楊柳比着女子的腰了。「金覊玉勒臨風望，認得楊家靜婉腰」，「莫敎移入靈和殿，宮女三千又妬伊」，這不是很好的證據嗎？</p>
<p>因為「望秋先零」，所以秋柳更是詩人們傷心的材料，古來秋柳詩不知道有多少，這裏暫且不說，白石道人的詞引是古今少有的佳作，他在凄凉犯中就有下邊的句子：</p>
<p>「合肥巷陌皆種柳，秋風夕起騷騷然，予客居闔戶時，聞馬嘶，出城四顧，則荒烟野草，不勝凄黯」。</p>
<p>這雖則不是專說秋柳，但是他所刻劃種種，實在是攝秋柳之魂的，這和「樹猶如此」一語，大概可算寫「柳」的雙絕罷！</p>
<p>窗外有一株楊柳，雖則春寒如水，但在這連綫的春雨中，已經很有些萌孽了，大概淸明寒食左右，總有不少的孩子來攀折着嫩枝做楊柳球罷。「淸明戴楊柳」我又沉浸在回憶的海中了。雨是不停的下着。</p>

<p>娜拉正在和孩子們捉迷藏，柯樂克又來了，他盤問着林敦夫人是吾是要在銀行裏有個位置，他要求娜拉替他保全他的位置，並且，他以娜拉冒簽她父親的名字的借據作為耍挾，他開誠布公的說：「好幾年之前我鬧了一點事，那伴事雖然不曾鬧到法庭上去，但是從此以後我前進的路條條都斷了，現在我要洗手不幹了，我必須極力恢復我的名譽才是。這銀行裏的位置正是我爬上去的第一步，不想你的丈夫要把我從梯子上踢下來再跌到泥溝裏去」。最後他說，「我犯的那椿使我聲名掃地不容於社會的事，和你所做的恰是一樣，一些也不多，一些也不少。」</p>
<p>娜拉說：「我不相信。難道法律不許做女兒的想個法子免得他臨死的父親煩惱嗎？難道法律不許做妻子的救他丈夫的命嗎？要是這樣，這種一定是笨法律！」</p>
<p>柯樂克可冷冷地：「法律不管人的居心怎樣。」</p>

<p>Nanjing – Japanese Ambassador Arita revisited Foreign Minister Zhang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 2:30 PM on the 17th for further discussions, departing at 5:10 PM, for a total conversation time of two hours and forty minutes. Foreign Minister Zhang's conversation consisted of explaining his views on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations from China's standpoint. He first recounted various past circumstances between China and Japan, then mentioned the current general state of affairs between China and Japan, reflecting on the past and considering the present, stating his opinions on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. Arita also stated his opinions on this, and the circumstances on the Japanese side were also mentioned, but concrete issues between China and Japan were not discussed throughout. It is understood that the discussions between the two are not yet complete, and Arita plans to visit Foreign Minister Zhang again on the 18th, but the time has yet to be determined. It is reported that Arita is scheduled to go to Shanghai on the 21st, staying in Nanjing for only three or four days. Given the complexity of the past general circumstances between China and Japan, it will be impossible to discuss concrete issues in such a short period of time. Although Zhang and Arita talked for more than two hours on the 17th, they only recounted and expressed their views. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<p>Japanese Ambassador Arita revisited Zhang Qun at 2:30 PM on the 17th, continuing their discussions for three hours, departing around 5:00 PM. It is reported that Zhang and Arita's discussion involved explaining his views on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations from China's standpoint. Arita also responded with his opinions. It is also reported that Zhang and Arita will meet again on the 18th. After Arita returned to the embassy, he told reporters that today's meeting with Foreign Minister Zhang involved exchanging opinions on Sino-Japanese issues. Because Zhang and he are old friends, the conversation was conducted in a friendly manner, with both parties expressing their views as much as possible, which was very pleasant. After this meeting, it may be possible to achieve considerable proximity regarding Sino-Japanese issues. However, he does not intend to reach any conclusions before returning to his country, but he wants to use this opportunity to open a new path for Sino-Japanese issues, paving the way for formal negotiations between the two countries in the future. He concluded by saying that he is scheduled to meet Zhang again on the 18th to continue their discussions. According to diplomatic sources, Arita will have several more meetings with Zhang before leaving Nanjing, but they will only exchange views on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations from their respective standpoints. Furthermore, Jiang Zuobin and Chen Shaokuan are scheduled to host banquets for Arita on the evenings of the 18th and 19th, respectively. It is reported that Arita is scheduled to leave Nanjing for Shanghai on the 21st to await a ship back to Japan. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e10">The Future of Italian-Abyssinian Reconciliation <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>– Issue</p>
<p>Since Italy launched the East African War last October, it had hoped to conquer the entire Abyssinia in a week or two. However, the heroic resistance of the Abyssinian people gave the Blackshirt Prime Minister's aggression a major blow. Italy not only failed to achieve complete victory in military terms as expected, but also suffered the crime of "aggressor" internationally and was subjected to economic sanctions by more than 50 countries of the League of Nations, plunging the entire country into extreme isolation. If this continues for such a long time, not only will the hope of conquering Abyssinia be uncertain, but the Fascist regime in Italy will also be in danger of being overthrown. However, Germany's abandonment of the Locarno Pact and its invasion of the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland gave Italy an excellent opportunity to make a very good deal. During the meeting of the League of Nations' Thirteen-Nation Committee in London in this early period, there must be further deliberations on the method of Italian-Abyssinian reconciliation.</p>
<p>The reason why Abyssinia was able to maintain its resistance for as long as half a year during the East African War was not only due to the heroic resistance of the Abyssinian people, but also because it received assistance from Britain and peace-loving countries internationally. Without this external assistance, the East African War of Aggression might not have lasted this long. The reason for Britain's support for Abyssinia's resistance against Italy is naturally that Italy's exclusive possession of Abyssinia will endanger its Mediterranean sea lane security, and not truly for the benefit of small nations. France's participation in sanctions against Italy is also because under the obligations of the League of Nations, it cannot but choose to follow international collective action, because it has always based its foreign policy on supporting the League of Nations and the collective security system, and not because Italy's aggression has harmed France's colonial interests. Although the sanctions against Italy by other member states of the League of Nations were mostly out of a sincere desire to uphold peace, their strength was not very great. Because the imperialists such as Britain and France support the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy, they each have their own selfish motives, and they are not really thinking about the interests of small nations. Therefore, the peace proposal of dividing Abyssinia was hastily put forward to replace the League of Nations' righteous action. The peace negotiations between Laval and Hall last year were the most prominent of these, but this peace proposal ultimately failed because of the opposition of peace-loving people.</p>
<p>However, recently, Germany's actions have greatly changed the international situation. The League of Nations' attention has shifted from the Mediterranean to the Rhine, and France, which previously advocated sanctions against Italy, now needs Italy's assistance to fulfill its obligations under the Locarno Pact. However, to obtain Italy's assistance, it is natural to give it conditions in exchange. This means canceling the League of Nations' economic sanctions against Italy and sacrificing Abyssinia under the mask of peaceful reconciliation. Mussolini has already stated that "Italy is willing to fulfill its obligations under the Locarno Pact, but if Geneva wants to sanction Germany, it is difficult to agree for the time being because Italy itself is threatened by sanctions." This has shown that France wants Italy to help, so it must first cancel the sanctions against Italy, otherwise Italy will not only be unable to fulfill its obligations under the Locarno Pact, but will also stand on Germany's side. In this situation, France will naturally accept Italy's conditions for the sake of its own interests, and Britain will also accommodate Italy because the Rhine problem is more serious than the East African War. Therefore, Italy is sure to make this deal.</p>
<p>From the above observation, we can see that the foreign policies of the imperialist countries are all for their own interests. If small nations want to achieve thorough liberation, they must rely on their own greater efforts and more courageous struggles. Abyssinia has not failed now. It can not only sustain itself militarily, but has also gained tremendous victory in spirit. For the sake of its future, it will surely have more glorious struggles.</p>

<p>Moscow: According to news from Kulun received here, Outer Mongolia and "Manchukuo" have agreed to organize a joint committee to resolve all border disputes. (National News, 16th) On March 16th, Japanese Ambassador Ota, under the order of the Japanese government, visited Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Stomonyakov and made the following suggestions:</p>
<p>First, a committee of representatives from the Soviet Union and "Manchukuo" should be organized to re-establish boundary markers between Lake Xingkai and the Tumen River (the junction of the Soviet Union, Korea, and Manchuria). These representatives should jointly investigate the treaty-specified boundary and inspect the condition of the boundary markers, re-establishing new boundary markers where necessary. Erect electric fences or earthen walls between the boundary markers and clear a small lane in the forest. This was Ota's response to the memorandum issued by Stomonyakov on March 9th, in which the Soviet Union stated that if border security could be guaranteed, the Soviet Union would not object to re-establishing boundary markers and that the Japanese government had also agreed to this.</p>
<p>Second, if the Soviet government agrees to start re-establishing boundary markers, the Japanese government is prepared to accept the Soviet proposal to organize a mixed committee to investigate border conflicts in the same section of the Soviet-"Manchukuo" border.</p>
<p>Stomonyakov said that these proposals by the Japanese government were in line with the will of the Soviet government, but he believed it was still necessary to inquire whether the Japanese government was willing, in order to safeguard the interests of peace in the Far East, to immediately find a way to organize a similar committee on the Mongolian-Manchukuo border, as he firmly believed that under these circumstances, Japan's proposal would be suitable for the Soviet government's benevolent attitude. In addition, Stomonyakov asked Ota to pay attention that while the two governments were discussing the organization of a mixed committee to resolve border conflicts, this committee should investigate the entire border between the Soviet Union and "Manchukuo," and not be limited to any part. Ota promised to convey Stomonyakov's views to the Japanese government. (TASS, 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Since the establishment of the Hirota Cabinet, the diplomatic work of Japan regarding the border issue between "Manchukuo" and Russia has attracted the attention of various parties at home and abroad. The Hirota Foreign Minister has set the following solution plan for the border issue and will instruct the ambassador to Russia to conduct negotiations soon. The main points are to establish a border demarcation committee and a border dispute settlement committee composed of Japanese, "Manchukuo" and Russian commissioners. In addition to eliminating the causes of disputes, in case of exceptional disputes, the handling committee will automatically mediate the matter to prevent its expansion and deterioration. As for adjusting the "Mongolian-Manchukuo border issue," any third country's participation should be rejected. The "Manchukuo" and Mongolia should follow the example of the Japanese-"Manchukuo"-Russia three-nation committee to establish a border demarcation committee and a dispute settlement committee to eliminate the causes of disputes and resolve sudden incidents.

<h3 id="e46">Japanese Hirota Cabinet Announces Policy Outline: Actively Enrich National Defense to Adapt to the Situation, Pursue Independent Diplomacy to Correct International Relations, Refresh General Administration to Maintain the Dignity of the Constitution <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Hirota Cabinet announced a new political program and policies. The full text of the statement is recorded below: Our domestic and foreign situations are difficult, and their origins are very deep. The government, in this situation, is determined to thoroughly refresh general administration in order to break through the difficult situation. The basis of governance lies in promoting the ideals of the founding of the nation and exemplifying the beauty of one emperor, all people, and the unity of the whole country. Therefore, clearly demonstrating the consolidated concept of the national polity is the government's primary task. All domestic and foreign policies should be directed towards this, without saying. Among them, such as refreshing education and culture, revitalizing the national spirit, and at the same time eliminating ideas that are incompatible with the national polity, it is always necessary to maintain the dignity of the national constitution and national laws. It is considered most important to deal with the current situation. Based on international trust, to enhance the friendship of various countries, for the co-existence and co-prosperity of East Asian countries, the inseparable relationship between Japan and "Manchukuo" must be the foundation in order to promote the reality of East Asia's stabilizing force. This will contribute to world peace and human welfare. This is our country's consistent policy. Regardless of diplomacy and national defense, this national policy should be followed. In view of the current state of the international situation, the government, regarding the enrichment of national defense and the improvement of its various facilities, must strive for value and enrichment. At the same time, the establishment of independent and proactive diplomacy should also be expected. In order to adapt to the development of national fortune, it is necessary to reform the tax system, improve finance, refresh financial economy, and expand industry and trade, and make every effort to cultivate the basic strength of the country. This is the most urgent task to be carried out now. In recent years, evils are rampant everywhere in the world, and the oppression of national life is about to increase. Various interests tend to provoke conflicts everywhere. This is a violation of our great spirit of establishing the country with morality, and there is nothing more worrying for the country. Therefore, the government will thoroughly investigate and manage all areas of national life to achieve stability and upward mobility, so that the people can get the reality of living and working in peace. As for reforming various policies, it is difficult to achieve perfection if only in terms of action and administration. Therefore, we should revitalize the administration of officials, update the administrative structure, and recognize the necessary diagrams. The government will not be content with old habits and is determined to widely observe the internal and external situation and implement appropriate improvements in governance. When various tasks are realized, the government should encourage its departments to strive for perfection, and it is necessary to deeply examine public opinion by gathering public wisdom. Although it is not appropriate to rush it, those who believe it is right should resolutely move forward bravely, and dare not be confused for a while, leading to the delay of a century of great plans.

<p>Tokyo: Army Minister Terauchi met with other important figures in the army this morning to consider the new political program statement by Prime Minister Hirota. They unanimously agreed that this draft differed slightly from the military's accepted opinion on the current situation in Japan. Therefore, it was decided that the wording must be revised so that the proposals put forward by the army during the formation of the cabinet would be included and the government would be determined to implement them. At the same time, Navy Minister Nagano and others also discussed the original draft of the statement. Although the wishes expressed by the navy during the formation of the cabinet had been included, the wording was too abstract and unclear. Therefore, it was doubtful whether the government had the will to vigorously implement its policies. Nagano submitted the navy's views before the cabinet meeting, and the cabinet decided to revise it according to his suggestion. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<p>Nanjing: During today's cabinet meeting on the budget for the next year to be submitted to the special parliament, Finance Minister Baba said that it largely followed the decisions made by the previous cabinet. All cabinet members had no objections, so it was approved and decided. (Dentsu, 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Finance Minister Baba talked about the foundation of the so-called "Baba Finance" as follows:</p>
<p>All the members of the current cabinet are determined to take on national politics with extraordinary awareness and hope that the people will also have the same determination and cooperate with the government. The current cabinet has the policy of seeking a new perspective on economic and political aspects, but it is not appropriate to implement overly drastic reforms and cannot "kill the cow while trying to straighten its horns." However, it is also impossible not to straighten the horns, and therefore it is quite difficult to start. "The Tax System Reform Cabinet Deliberation Council has also established a policy of implementation within one or two years, but the Ministry of Finance has no intention, so it is intended to fully study the actual implementation of tax system reform, or it is not impossible to partially implement a tax increase from the Showa 12th degree, but it seems more appropriate to do it at the time of implementing tax system reform." "As for the digestion of public bonds, there is no need to worry about it immediately, but for the sake of smooth digestion, it may be necessary to study what kind of measures should be taken in administration and legislation.</p>
<p>In short, the premise of the public debt problem is to stabilize the financial world, which is what we hope to pay attention to. (Dentsu, 17th)</p>

<p>Tokyo: The national control of electricity is an important item of national policy in times of emergency.

The specific method is currently being studied by the Cabinet Investigation Bureau. Raidenki intends to advocate the nationalization of electricity at the cabinet meeting on the 17th, but adopts a gradualist approach to avoid causing sharp impacts on all parties.

<p>Nanjing: In order to establish foreign communications, improve international countermeasures, and reduce the burden on users of telecommunications, etc., and in order to expect the thorough implementation of national wireless electricity policy, the Ministry of Communications has decided to enrich the international wireless electricity network and improve existing equipment. Starting this year, it will establish a five-year plan for external wireless electricity, so that the face of Japan's external communications will be new. In the plan, the first step is to establish two major transmitting and receiving stations in Tokyo and Osaka. In principle, the Tokyo side will handle communications with the United States and international wireless electricity broadcasts, while the Osaka side will handle part of the communications with Europe and communications with the Far East and the South Seas. Therefore, the external wireless electricity set up in Nagoya will be abolished. In Tokyo, the already established Oyama transmitting station and Fukuoka receiving station will be brought together. The Osaka transmitting station will also use the already established Isami as a starting point. The receiving station, which has been in Yokkaichi, will be abolished and newly established in the Hyogo prefecture. This equipment is scheduled to be completed in the Showa 12th year. The Ministry of Communications will base on the completed equipment and formulate a five-year plan, expanding to New York, Canada, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Panama, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, the European Soviet Union, Australia, Czech Republic, Turkey in the United States, to Qingdao, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangdong, Hong Kong, Australia, the Malay Peninsula, South Africa, Egypt.

<h3 id="e73">British House of Commons Passes Navy Budget, Battleship Retrofitting, Defending the Skies, Providing Addressed Submarines Obtain Effective Methods <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>London: Yesterday, the House of Commons debated the 69,930,000-pound Navy budget. Lord Stanley, Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty, spoke first, offering condolences for the passing of Admiral Beatty, saying that another great figure of Britain has weakened. He then explained the Navy budget, saying that the funds needed for the plan proposed in the White Paper to improve efficiency and correct defects, as well as the 1936 shipbuilding program, were not included in this budget, but would be included in a supplementary budget. This year's budget is 9,880,000 pounds higher than last year's, of which 4,645,000 pounds is for the costs of carrying out the already approved 1934 and 1935 shipbuilding programs. More ammunition is needed for anti-aircraft guns, and the cost of fuel supplies will also increase, so these two items have also increased slightly. The cost of fleet air equipment has also increased by 1,193,000 pounds due to the addition of 27 aircraft, of which 3 are for aircraft carriers, and 12 each for battleships and cruisers, increasing the air power of the British fleet from 190 to 217 aircraft. Also due to the replacement of 84 old aircraft with new ones. Regarding the effectiveness of battleships, there is currently debate. The question is whether aircraft can prevent battleships from performing their duties, and whether battleships can be replaced by cruisers and aircraft, or by aircraft and smaller warships. He wished to inform the House that large-scale experiments have recently been conducted to determine the damage caused by bombs above and below the waterline. The results show that this danger can be dealt with by new construction or retrofitting. The counterattack of anti-aircraft guns on warships has now been developed to the best of our knowledge. The Admiralty will continue to improve this knowledge with new experience. Therefore, according to the analysis of British naval experts, battleships will not lose their effectiveness due to aerial attacks. Battleships will remain the strongest objects at sea. The unanimous opinion of naval experts at home and abroad is that battleships are an indispensable part of the fleet. Battleships do not need to be very large. Britain advocates for battleships of 25,000 tons, but there must be a sufficient difference between battleships and cruisers to avoid using cruisers as the mainstay. Since other countries have large battleships, British battleships must also have large battleships to counter them. Labor Party member Alexander spoke on behalf of the opposition party, criticizing the government for not engaging in active or sufficient consultations with other countries of the League of Nations to determine its contribution to collective security. Labor Party member Sinclair said that if the costs between overseas and aerial defenses were readjusted, who knows if it could not provide more efficient and economical protection for trade routes. Conservative Party member Churchill said that the first foundation of British naval policy is the acceptance of British-American equality. There will never be any naval rivalry between Britain and the United States. The three major naval powers of the world are each located in one corner of the earth, making mutual attacks impossible. This is indeed fortunate. The Labor Party moved to reduce the number of naval personnel, but this motion was defeated by 191 votes to 75. The House then passed the 1936 Navy budget. The funding for this case is 9,880,000 pounds higher than last year, and its new uses are as follows: 4,645,000 pounds is used to carry out the already approved shipbuilding program, 1,193,000 pounds is used to increase air equipment for the fleet, and 3,936,000 pounds is used to maintain naval strength, such as repairs, retrofitting, and defending against aerial attacks. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>London: During the House of Commons debate on the Navy budget today, Conservative Party member Somerset Ganer, son of Admiral Ganer, declared that he hoped not to be suspected of leaking any secrets, but that we have almost completed an effective method of resisting submarines based on the principle of reflection. This is already a fact. Any ship equipped with this device is at risk of being immediately destroyed if a submarine enters its torpedo range. He also said that the Admiralty has converted a cruiser into a completely new type of aircraft-resistant ship that can emit extremely fierce fire to defend the harbor. Admiralty Parliamentary Secretary Stanley Zeng had previously declared before Ganer that the advantage that Britain gained at the end of the European War in defeating the submarine threat can still be maintained today.</p>
<p>London: When the House of Commons discussed the Navy budget today, former Navy Minister Churchill, a Conservative right-wing member, declared, "The foundation of British naval policy is the principle of naval equality between Britain and the United States. The so-called equality is not only for battleships, but also for the entire fleet. Although the United States may be forced by circumstances to expand its naval forces to be above Britain at a certain time, we should also treat it with goodwill and without suspicion, because Britain may also be forced by circumstances to increase its naval forces to be above the United States at another time." From another perspective, if the United States needs to expand its naval forces to be relatively equal to Britain due to the influence of Japanese policy, it will not indirectly threaten Britain. "As for Singapore, it was originally the base of the British Navy in the Far East. Its distance from Japan is the same as the distance between our country's Portsmouth Harbor and America's New York Harbor. Its function is limited to defending the empire and not to attack Japan's naval base. This is the case now, and it will be the case in the future. Japan does not need to be uneasy about the Singapore base. This is the same as Britain using Portsmouth as a military port, and the United States does not need to worry about it." Admiral Keyes, the former commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, then spoke, advocating that Singapore should become a strong naval base. At this point, Navy Resolution Officer Lord Stanley stood up to answer, saying that the government should take measures to strengthen maritime control in Singapore without neglecting it. As for the navies of Britain and the United States, there is no competition, and this can be clarified by Mr. Churchill. (Havas, 16th)</p>

<p>Berlin: Hitler returned to Berlin from Frankfurt early this morning and immediately held secret consultations with his advisors regarding the League of Nations' invitation to Germany to attend the Executive Council meeting.

<p>London: Germany has accepted the League of Nations' invitation to attend the Executive Council meeting and is said to have made important reservations, one of which is that if the German delegation arrives in London, it should have the right to negotiate with the other signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty.

<p>London: According to sources in Berlin, the German government has informed British Ambassador to Germany Sir Phipps that the country is willing to accept the British opinion in principle and is prepared to send representatives to London to attend the League of Nations Executive Council meeting. Once the British government provides more detailed information on the telegram sent by League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, the acceptance will be confirmed. It is reported that Germany had made conditions to the League of Nations, the second of which was to require the League of Nations to promptly submit the various proposals made by its head of state, Hitler, for discussion. Avenol replied that this condition could not be met and the Executive Council had no right to guarantee it. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin: After the League of Nations Executive Council formally invited Germany to send representatives to attend the meeting, Germany immediately submitted a reply, which the Executive Council considered could not be fully accepted. It then entrusted Secretary-General Avenol to reply again. According to various observers, the reason why Germany delayed replying to Avenol's telegram was that Head of State Hitler wanted to wait for the British government to provide assurances that it would consider the various proposals made by Germany before sending representatives to London. This morning, important diplomatic talks were held between Berlin and London by British Ambassador to Germany Sir Phipps. Phipps reiterated the British government's views, saying that Britain hoped that Germany would send representatives to London to discuss ways to maintain peace. (Havas, 17th)</p>

<p>Frankfurt: Today, Hitler spoke to 25,000 National Socialist Party members here, declaring that we will never withdraw from the Rhineland, and we will never give up our demand for equal rights. Today's question is not whether the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno Treaty have been broken, but whether it is just to exclude Germany from the society of equal nations. Foreign politicians who have studied history must know that treaties not based on equality cannot be permanently maintained. He then spoke of the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty, and Hitler declared that although we cannot prevent France from concluding such a treaty, France's conclusion of this treaty cannot but make me restore its inherent sovereignty. Mr. Hitler then said, "I am prepared to abandon past grievances with France and establish an agreement. I firmly believe that the people of both countries must expect such an understanding. I firmly believe that the French do not want me to always be in a forced position. As for military alliances, I do not want to hear about them, because they only add to the disaster and do not help peace. I firmly believe that the countries of Europe will one day realize that the losses of war can never be compensated by any plunder, and will abandon all their hatred, suspicion, and terror."

<p>London - After the League of Nations Executive Council formally invited Germany to send a representative, Germany submitted a reply yesterday, accepting the invitation in principle, but with two conditions: 1. The rights enjoyed by the German representative during the Executive Council's discussions and votes should be completely equal to those of other countries' representatives. 2. The resolute stance of France and Belgium, which originally insisted that negotiations on the suggestions in the German memorandum should not begin until German troops withdrew from the Rhineland, must be abandoned. The Executive Council has now responded to this reply, with League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol sending a telegram to Berlin stating, "According to the Locarno Treaty, France and Belgium, like Germany, are guaranteed nations. Therefore, Germany's conditions for participating in the Executive Council's review of the applications from France and Belgium will be the same as those of the two countries. In other words, they have full rights to participate in the discussion, but when voting (to determine the consensus of the Executive Council members), the votes of Germany, France, and Belgium will not be counted. (Note: This means that if the voting results show a consensus among all countries, then regardless of whether Germany, France, or Belgium cast opposing votes, it will be considered a consensus.) As for the guarantee requested by Germany in its second condition, the Executive Council has no authority to grant it to the German government." It is generally understood that British Ambassador to Germany Sir Phipps will engage in further contact with the German Foreign Ministry to facilitate Germany's participation in the Executive Council meeting. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London - The League of Nations Executive Council held a closed-door meeting at 3:45 PM, chaired by Bruce. He began by reading the German reply. Subsequently, French Foreign Minister Flandin raised several objections to the two German conditions. Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu then proposed that the closed-door meeting be changed to a secret meeting, which the Executive Council decided to do. Therefore, all experts and delegation members, except for the chief representatives of each country, left the venue. Foreign Minister Flandin then continued to express his views, concluding that the first German condition was acceptable, but the second condition was firmly rejected. Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu, Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü, Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, Polish Foreign Minister Beck, and Spanish Foreign Minister Basilio all spoke, stating that the German conditions could not be accepted. Other national representatives (Great Britain, Argentina, Australia, Portugal, Denmark, Chile, Italy) supported the German view. The meeting then reverted to a closed-door format, ending at 5:20 PM. After two hours, a public meeting was convened, during which French Foreign Minister Flandin presented a joint draft resolution from France and Belgium and made a brief statement beforehand: "The clauses of the Locarno Treaty and Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles have been violated. Our government and our delegation request that the League of Nations Executive Council clearly announce this. The reasons for this have already been explained to the Executive Council, and I do not intend to add anything further. The Belgian government has also authorized me to speak on its behalf. Therefore, I am presenting this joint draft resolution to the Executive Council on behalf of the governments of France and Belgium." Chairman Bruce then read out this draft resolution and stated that due to time constraints, it would be discussed tomorrow. Bruce also read out the Executive Council's reply to Germany. The Executive Council adjourned at 7:40 PM, and a decision was made to hold the next meeting at 3:30 PM tomorrow afternoon. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London - At the beginning of the public meeting, French Foreign Minister Flandin moved that Germany's military reoccupation of the demilitarized zone in the Rhineland violated Article 43 of the Treaty of Versailles. Belgian Prime Minister van Zeeland seconded the motion. Chairman Bruce then rose and made the aforementioned announcement, and without any discussion, adjourned the meeting until 3:30 PM in the afternoon. At the first closed-door meeting of the Executive Council, Chairman Bruce announced the opening of the meeting. Bruce then asked the representatives whether the subsequent meetings should be held publicly or in private. If held in private, all advisors and secretaries would not be allowed to attend. French Foreign Minister Flandin then rose to speak, criticizing the nature of Germany's reply to the League of Nations' request. Bruce interrupted him due to order concerns. It was then resolved that the Executive Council would hold a secret meeting at 6:00 PM to consider Germany's reply. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London - The Executive Council held a public meeting for fifteen minutes today and then declared an adjournment until 3:30 PM tomorrow afternoon.

<h3 id="e79">France and Belgium Submit Draft Resolution to the League of Nations: Condemning Germany for Violating Treaties <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>London - French Foreign Minister Flandin has submitted a joint draft resolution from France and Belgium to the League of Nations Executive Council, which states: "The League of Nations Executive Council, based on the application submitted by France and Belgium on the 8th of this month, hereby resolves as follows: 1. The German government, disregarding the obligations stipulated in Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno Treaty, has sent troops into the demilitarized zone along the Rhine River and stationed them in that area. This action constitutes a violation of Article 43 of the Treaty of Versailles. 2. The Council instructs the Secretary-General to notify the signatory nations of the Locarno Treaty of Germany's violation." (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London - It is generally understood that during today's closed-door meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council, the British representative requested that France and Belgium postpone the submission of their joint draft resolution until the League of Nations received Germany's second reply. However, this proposal was opposed by France. Therefore, the draft resolution was ultimately submitted at the Executive Council's public meeting. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London - Since Germany abrogated the Locarno Treaty, some have argued that the relevant countries should conclude a new treaty to replace the old one, regardless of whether Germany participates at that time. The representatives of Britain, France, and Belgium immediately submitted separate memoranda to explain the views of their respective governments for presentation at the conference of the Locarno Treaty signatory nations. The Locarno conference was held in private at the Foreign Office this morning at 11:00 AM (originally scheduled to be held at Foreign Secretary Eden's private residence). In addition to Foreign Secretary Eden and Lord Privy Seal Halifax, French Foreign Minister Flandin, Belgian Prime Minister van Zeeland, and Italian Ambassador Grandi also attended. It is reported that the memoranda were discussed. Although the contents of these memoranda have not been disclosed, it is generally understood that the memorandum submitted by France includes three approaches: 1. The Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact should be submitted to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for a ruling to determine whether it conflicts with the Locarno Treaty. 2. The German troops stationed in the Rhineland should be reduced, and its heavy artillery units should be withdrawn to a point 50 kilometers east of the Rhine River. If Germany cannot accept this approach, the relevant countries should immediately decide on economic sanctions. 3. European countries should establish a new security system to replace the Locarno Treaty, so that if the Rhineland cannot be demilitarized, this new security system can provide France with guarantees that are more comprehensive than those originally stipulated in the Locarno Treaty.

<p>London - It is reported that the Thriteen-Nation Committee will hold a meeting here on Wednesday. French Foreign Minister Flandin will return to Paris to consult with the French cabinet on all matters. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>London - Our diplomatic correspondent has learned that French Foreign Minister Flandin and Minister without Portfolio Penancier plan to return to France this Thursday to report the progress of the diplomatic situation here to the Council of Ministers. It is also said that if the negotiations here can achieve tangible results before the two depart, then future negotiations will continue in Geneva.

<h3 id="e80">British Cabinet Decides to Continue Mediation Policy: All Locarno Signatories Must Make Concessions <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>London - Regarding Germany's reply to the League of Nations, the British Cabinet held a meeting yesterday and decided to instruct Foreign Secretary Eden to continue the mediation policy. The proposed approach is to demand that each signatory to the Locarno Treaty make some sacrifices in order to reach a peaceful solution. The content of this plan is: 1. Germany must withdraw a portion of its troops stationed in the Rhineland as a sign of good faith. 2. France and Belgium must reduce their hardline attitude towards Germany. In Britain's case, it must fulfill its obligations under the Locarno Treaty and provide military assistance to France and Belgium if they are attacked by Germany in the future. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>London - It is generally understood that at tomorrow's meeting of the Locarno Treaty signatory nations, the British delegation will propose a suggestion to guarantee the security of France and Belgium. When a broader security system is established in the future under the terms of the Locarno Treaty, the measures to guarantee the security of France and Belgium can be incorporated into it. At this time, British officials are still striving for Germany to make concessions and agree to participate in negotiations in order to improve the diplomatic situation, and believe that if Germany can send a representative to the League of Nations Executive Council meeting, it can be considered the first step in making concessions. As for Germany's future representative, Ribbentrop, a confidant of Chancellor Hitler, would be the most suitable. Given the difficult situation, Germany must send a signal of compromise, which Ribbentrop will surely understand. The British Ambassador to Germany will contact the German government again to encourage it to send a representative to the Executive Council meeting. However, the reply issued by the Executive Council today is clearly worded, and any further conditional response from Germany will not be accepted by Britain. It is likely that Germany will request the Executive Council to postpone the meeting so that the German representative can arrive in time. If so, the Executive Council's meeting tomorrow afternoon will inevitably be postponed. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>Rome - The authorities of Italy, Austria, and Hungary had originally scheduled a meeting to be held here from the 18th to the 20th of this month to strengthen their joint policy based on the Rome Protocols signed by the three countries on March 17th of the year before last. The meeting date has now been changed to the 21st to the 23rd. According to official statements, this meeting has no connection with the events currently being negotiated in London. However, the current international situation is making the future negotiations between Italy, Austria, and Hungary increasingly important, which officials do not deny. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Budapest, Hungary - Prime Minister Gömbös of Hungary was scheduled to depart for Rome tomorrow to attend the meeting of Italy, Austria, and Hungary. Due to the postponement of the meeting, the Prime Minister's departure has also been delayed, and he will likely depart on the 19th, but this is not yet certain. It is reported that the Italian government hopes that Gömbös will postpone his departure until the issue of Germany's entry into the Rhineland has been resolved in London before proceeding. (Havas dispatch, 16th) Italian government and German Embassy spokesmen today both denied that Germany had warned Italy not to participate in League of Nations sanctions against Germany. The London Daily Telegraph previously reported that Germany had warned Italy that its attitude towards the Rhine issue was not friendly and that Germany would stop exporting to Italy, making it unable to resist League of Nations sanctions.

<p>Changchun Correspondence: The Manchurian Lead Mine Company, established jointly by South Manchuria Railway and the Japan-Manchuria Mining Company, is currently mining lead and zinc ore at the Yangjiazhai mine. This type of ore is a crucial mineral that is most lacking in Japanese minerals and of very high quality. Therefore, when the ore is sold, the Japanese industry pays exceptional attention to it. Furthermore, when the machines were started at the end of last year, the ore dressing plant could not operate at all due to the temperature. Later, heating was installed to improve the situation, allowing operations to continue. The capacity of the ore dressing is 70 tons per month, and there is an experimental plant capable of processing the raw ore. There are 200 tons of selected ore in storage.</p>

<p>Lanzhou Correspondence: Provincial Chairman Yu Xuezhong believes that the appropriation system is riddled with corruption. While Longdong and Longnan have already abolished it, the Hexi counties have not yet done so. Why should there be such a distinction among the people of the same county? Therefore, he resolutely decided to follow the precedent of last year's case and abolish it uniformly from March 1st of this year. As for the issue of military expenses, an agreement has been reached with the New 2nd Army's 100th Division and the 1st Cavalry Division to abolish the appropriation system. The main measures are as follows: 1. No designated appropriations will be made from March 1st onwards. 2. Appropriations that were approved but not yet paid before March 1st will be handled in accordance with the precedent of abolishing military and political appropriations in the 24th and 25th years of the Republic. Payment should be stopped immediately upon receipt of the telegram and the amount stopped should be reported within three days. 3. After the abolition of appropriations, the regular and miscellaneous taxes and land surcharges levied this year should be divided equally and remitted to the provincial treasury monthly without delay. 4. Any long-term appropriations or surcharges used for loans in the past should be handled separately. Unless expressly ordered, this year's tax collections should not be disbursed without authorization to avoid affecting the budget, and any violation will result in compensation. It is reported that the provincial government has clearly instructed and telegraphed the heads of the Hexi counties of Wuwei, Gulang, Linze, Minle, Jinta, Dingxin, Dunhuang, Yongchang, Zhangye, Shandan, Jiuquan, Gaotai, Anxi, and Yumen to comply with these measures. A long-standing corrupt practice has been eliminated in one fell swoop, greatly benefiting the people.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Guangdong Provincial Government Issues Order: People to Serve the Public <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Provincial Assembly Proposal Passed to Implement Policy Plans to Continue Abolishing Various Harsh Levies Guangzhou Correspondence: At the recent fourth regular meeting of the Guangdong Provincial Assembly, the provincial assemblymen proposed that the people of the province should serve the public to increase the province's production. The proposal was resolved and passed and was sent to the provincial government for handling by the Provincial Assembly. After the provincial government approved the letter, it ordered the Department of Civil Affairs to handle the original proposal. The Department of Civil Affairs, considering this case to be important, should immediately notify all counties to implement it conscientiously, and it has ordered all counties to comply and report to the provincial government for review. The implementation measures are divided into several points: 1. Every able-bodied man in the province should serve the public for one day each month, designating local land reclamation, afforestation, water conservancy, and other public undertakings, which will be directed and supervised by the county and municipal governments and implemented by the district, township, and town offices. If any of these able-bodied men are unable to perform public service due to their duties or work outside the area, they will need to pay a service fee of 1 cent of legal tender per month in lieu of service to the relevant township office, which will be allocated to subsidize the necessary service expenses required to organize local services. 2. Public welfare undertakings should be organized by the counties, starting with the most urgent needs of the locality. The rest should be handled in Egypt. The standard for the most urgent needs of the locality will be resolved by a local villagers' meeting, reported by the district office with its evaluation, and forwarded to the county government for approval. 3. The machinery and medicines required for local people in the counties to serve the public will be proportionally subsidized by the substitution fee for able-bodied men or local public funds, all according to local circumstances. A letter is requested to the provincial government to order the Ministry of Civil Affairs to instruct the counties and cities to comply conscientiously, and the progress of each county and city is to be compiled and submitted to the Ministry for assessment every six months.</p>
<p>In the first three-year policy plan of Guangdong, the abolition of harsh, petty miscellaneous taxes is one of the important tasks. Now that the three-year implementation period has expired, most of the harsh levies in the counties have been abolished. However, there are still a small number of levies that have not been abolished due to the circumstances or insufficient adjustments. Therefore, in the second three-year policy plan, the authorities have decided to abolish all of them, leaving nothing behind. The local budget assessors, who departed yesterday to investigate the counties, and the Ministry of Finance, which sent personnel to inspect the changes in land tax collection in the counties, are all responsible for investigating the status of the harsh, petty miscellaneous levies in the counties. As soon as the Ministry of Finance collects the investigations from the various personnel who have returned to the province, it will formulate a plan to abolish them and include them in the second-stage policy plan for implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Xiamen Prison: Second Escape by Tunneling <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The tunnel was over a丈 in length, the project was massive, and the mastermind, inmate Su, designed it meticulously.</p>
<p>(Xiamen Correspondence)</p>
<p>Last November, inmates from cell number eight at the Xiamen Court Prison escaped by digging a tunnel. Afterwards, the prison poured a layer of洋灰 (cement) one尺 thick and five尺 wide near the walls of each cell. It was as hard as stone to prevent further digging. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the twelfth of this month at 4:50 AM, during the shift change between Head Guard Xie Baosen and Guards Xie Zhongpin and Xie Shujie, they initially heard inmates in cell number nine chanting Buddhist scriptures very loudly, then suddenly silence. Upon investigating, they found the lower level of the bunk beds had the upper level covered with raised blankets, as if everyone was sound asleep. Feeling something was off, they went to inspect and discovered a deep, dark, immeasurable hole in the ground. When they lifted the raised blankets, they found sacks filled with soil. Greatly alarmed, they raised the alarm.</p>
<p>Military police mobilized and entered the prison to search, while a headcount of the eighteen inmates in cell number nine revealed that nine had escaped. Subsequently, military police captured Lin Zhuang and Zhang Kan, who had not escaped far, nearby. Seven remained at large. As of the evening of the fourteenth, they were still untraced.</p>
<p>The escapees included:</p>
<p>*   Su Jianqiu, 26 years old, from Jiangsu, convicted of略誘 (luring away), sentenced to seven years and eight months, plus an additional year and four months for a previous escape.</p>
<p>*   Huang Shuizha, 29 years old, from Tong'an, convicted of kidnapping, sentenced to twelve years.</p>
<p>*   Wu Ben, from Tong'an, 30 years old, convicted of murder, sentenced to ten years.</p>
<p>*   Wu Qi, 23 years old, from Guangdong, convicted of robbery, sentenced to one year and six months.</p>
<p>*   Lin Zhu, 20 years old, from Jinmen, convicted of murder, sentenced to life imprisonment, appeal pending.</p>
<p>*   Xie Derun, 35 years old, from Tong'an, convicted of robbery, sentenced to ten years.</p>
<p>*   Lin Pengfei, 18 years old, from Nan'an, convicted of robbery, sentenced to five years.</p>
<p>An inspection by the court revealed that the opening of the tunnel was only one尺 eight寸 long, one尺 three寸 wide, and three尺 deep, located about five尺 from the wall, precisely at the edge of the洋灰 (cement) flooring. After removing two bricks, they dug down to a depth of three尺 eight寸, then turned horizontally to form a secret passage. It extended seven尺 outside the wall of cell number nine, then four尺 through a passageway by the women's prison, reaching the side of Jiangcuo Lane outside the prison wall. The tunnel was one丈 two or three尺 long, one尺 seven寸 high, and one尺 three寸 wide, only allowing one person to crawl through. The exit was one尺 eight寸 long and one尺 four寸 wide.</p>
<p>Questioning the captured Lin and Zhang, they confessed that Su Jianqiu was the mastermind. Su was originally sentenced to seven years. He escaped once two years ago, was caught, and had his sentence increased by eight months. Last year, he escaped again, was caught, and had his sentence increased by another year and four months. This was his thirteenth attempt. The digging tool was only a small wooden stick, about a尺 long. It had taken a long time to dig. A mouthwash cup was found in the tunnel, containing flour and oil mixed with a little soot. At night, they quietly dug, and during the day, they covered the bricks, using the mixture to seal and smooth the brick seams to make them look normal, avoiding the guards' attention. The excavated soil was placed in broken bedding and old clothes torn and sewn into bags. During the day, they were kept inside the tunnel, unnoticed, and at night, they were taken out for work. This went on for several days. On the day they completed the tunnel and escaped, they distributed the soil bags on the beds of the escapees and covered them with blankets, creating the illusion of sound sleepers. Later, over sixty bags of soil were discovered, revealing the magnitude of the project and the length of time it took. The nine inmates who did not escape all claimed ignorance. Cell number nine was directly adjacent to cell number eight. Less than four months apart, two separate tunneling escapes occurred. Head Guard Xie Maisen and the other two guards were all detained.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Su Jianqiu, having escaped twice before, was originally under close observation by the guards. Recently, Su had suddenly changed his behavior, strongly expressing remorse and encouraging fellow inmates to do good deeds and chant Buddhist scriptures together. As a result, the guards viewed him favorably and did not suspect ulterior motives. Two matchboxes were found in the tunnel, connected by over a丈 of white silk, used for communication within the tunnel, like a telephone. The depth of his planning is evident.</p>

<p>Going to Ta'er Monastery</p>
<p>West Post Correspondence</p>
<h3 id="e89">Travelogue of Qinghai (Continued): Ta'er Monastery Lamp Festival <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>On the ninth day of the second lunar month, we left the interesting Sangsige and followed the Hongyazi Gorge down. After passing the Lower Village, twenty li away, we arrived at a Han Chinese village and spent the night at Gao Village, located on the road to Xining. According to local Han Chinese tradition, their ancestors were exiled from Nanjing Zhuzixiang during the Six Dynasties. Their pronunciation of "I" as "nu" sounds very similar to the dialect of Songjiang Prefecture.</p>
<p>The next day, we arrived in Xining early. We were graciously hosted by Commander Ma Bufang and stayed at the Kunlun Hotel for four consecutive days. On the morning of the tenth day of the lunar month, he sent a car, along with Director Wang and Secretary Wang, to take Director Zhang Xiguang, representative of Chairman Yu of Gansu, and us to Ta'er Monastery to see the Lantern Festival.</p>
<p>Ta'er Monastery is ninety li south of Xining. The car exited the south gate and struggled several times on the frozen river. After repairs, it drove onto the main road. People rushing to the festival were everywhere, a colorful and endless stream. Some were riding horses, others were in轿車 (sedan cars). The car sped forward, raising a cloud of dust. Many Tibetan horses, having never seen a car, broke free from their tethers and ran away. The horse ran ahead, the car drove behind, the horse thinking it was a wild beast trying to eat it, running away in panic. Several village dogs frantically chased the car, barking as they ran, as if racing against the car.</p>
<p>After fifty li, the car passed through the bustling town of Lusha, drove up a hillside, and the snowy white tents filled the valleys. The sound of trumpets dispersed the crowds. The car stopped in front of Ta'er Monastery, which was 2800 meters above sea level. A lama guided us to rest in a僧房 (monk's cell) behind the "Little Golden Tile Temple."</p>
<p>Impression of Meeting the Panchen Lama</p>
<p>Since it was still early, we followed the guiding lama to visit the Panchen Lama. The Lama's 行轅 (official residence) was located in the red walls shimmering across the street. We went up the hillside, crowded with red-robed lamas because he was to receive the worship of 3,500 lamas from Ta'er Monastery today and the worship of the people tomorrow. Since he had not yet come out of the palace, we followed the guiding lama into the gate. A yellow satin 法座 (throne) was already set up in the center of the courtyard.</p>
<p>Several red-hatted堪布 (abbots) came out to greet us and took us to the secretariat. We were all embarrassed because we had prepared to pay homage to the Lama but had not brought a哈達 (ceremonial scarf), the Tibetan greeting gift. In the end, we could only offer our name cards. After waiting a long time, we chatted with his entourage and learned that the Lama was scheduled to go to Labrang Monastery (Xiahe County, Gansu) at the end of the second lunar month and would return to Tibet via Yushu and Derge in April or May.</p>
<p>A translator wearing a purple-red robe came down and said "Please." A total of nine of us followed him through the courtyard, up a short flight of stairs, and into a dimly lit禅房 (meditation room). A master in a袈裟 (robe), with a wizened face, a beard, and a benevolent expression, came out to greet us. We bowed in the Han Chinese manner, and he very politely gave each of us a cyan-gray哈達 (ceremonial scarf), and greeted us in broken Chinese, "Please sit," "Please sit." Afterwards, through the translator, we offered our respects and exchanged pleasantries. Because he was in a hurry to leave, we could not discuss his return to Tibet. As we parted, he shook hands with everyone. At this time, I noticed that his face was much thinner than when we met in Nanjing the year before, probably due to his worries about the country and the times.</p>
<p>Paying Respects at the Holy Mausoleum</p>
<p>Walking out of the 行轅 (official residence) gate, the golden tiles on the roof of the "Great Golden Tile Temple" shone towards me. It is commonly said that its value is equivalent to the庚子賠款 (Boxer Rebellion Indemnity), so we paid close attention. The roof was divided into two layers, in the style of a palace, surrounded by a cloth curtain with a six-character mantra. In the center of the ridge, there were three golden domes. The beautiful tiles reflected an unbearable yellow light towards the audience. As for whether it was pure gold or gilded, we had no time to investigate further.</p>
<p>At the foot of the temple walls, crowds of Mongolian and Tibetan people were prostrating themselves, competing to measure the circumference of the temple with their bodies. Next to it was a revolving scripture house, a row of "嘛呢輪" (prayer wheels) spinning non-stop. The people pushing the wheels were packed so tightly that there was no space, sometimes even two people pushing one axle at the same time.</p>
<p>The lama led us into the temple to pay respects at the "Holy Mausoleum"! The floor was worn into very deep grooves by the heads of the Buddhist believers. Opening the gate, we entered the solemn and majestic hall, which houses the body of宗喀巴 (Tsongkhapa), the founder of the "Yellow Sect." Therefore, the Great Golden Tile Temple has unparalleled value in Lamaism. The light in the Holy Mausoleum was exceptionally dim. In the light of the butter lamps, we saw a tall pagoda, the four walls of which were covered with delicate and beautiful神帳 (divine curtains) and佛　(Buddhist images).</p>
<p>To the left of the temple exit, there was a withered tree surrounded by a wooden fence, its branches scattered. The lama pointed and said, "宗喀巴 (Tsongkhapa)'s" placenta is buried here, so this bodhi tree grew. At the same time, we found several yellow Tibetan letters on a new branch, their strokes resembling wormholes. These are mostly the灵迹 (miraculous traces) of 宗喀巴 (Tsongkhapa). Several devout Tibetan women touched their heads to the wooden fence to show their respect.</p>
<p>Kunshan Jiancha Shi, Ding Chaowu, Arrives in Kunshan for Inspection</p>
<p>Jiangsu Inspector Ding Chaowu arrived in Kunshan from Shanghai on the morning of the sixteenth. After getting off the train, he drove directly to the county government to meet County Magistrate Peng. He inquired in detail about the county's administrative facilities. He then attended the joint memorial week speech. He said that all counties must focus on production and construction to solve the people's livelihood problems. In the afternoon, he went to various agencies for detailed inspections. He is expected to stay for one or two days.</p>
<p>A Jiangbei Woman Dies Tragically Under Train Wheels</p>
<p>A Jiangbei woman, about forty years old, a resident east of the railway洋橋 (foreign bridge) in Zhengyi Shiliting, a suburb of the county, was walking along the railway tracks on the evening of the previous day when a third- or fourth-class Shanghai-Nanjing train sped by. The woman was unable to avoid it in time and was knocked down, her thigh severed. She died on the spot, her flesh and blood blurred, a tragic sight. The driver, realizing he had caused the accident, stopped the train and dragged the body to the side of the tracks. He then drove to Zhengyi Station and informed the stationmaster to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>
<p>Suzhou Policemen Murder Case Appeal Opens</p>
<p>The case of He Naikang, a patrolman from the fifth precinct of the first public security bureau; Hong Shiqin, a patrol officer; Xu Baosheng, a patrol chief; Zhou Fan Qian Shugang; and four others conspiring to murder Gu Agen, a incense man from the Chen family nunnery at No. 46 Guanzai Lane, had its first hearing in the Jiangsu High Court yesterday (17th). The Wu County District Court originally sentenced He Naikang to death and Hong Shiqin to ten years in prison, with the other defendants also receiving separate sentences. The defendants refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. In addition to summoning the detained defendants, the court also subpoenaed Yan Jishi, the Chief Inspector of the Public Security Bureau, Xue Yijun, the Detective Captain of the Detective Team, and witnesses Cao Xiangshi and others. He Naikang hired lawyer Yao Xiaoqiu, Hong Shiqin hired lawyer Zhu Fucheng, and Xu Baosheng hired lawyer Jin Henian to defend them separately. At 10:30 am, Judge Siwen took the stand in the first criminal court to hear the case. He Naikang and others adamantly denied conspiring to murder Gu Agen. Because the case was complex, the interrogation lasted for five hours before the court adjourned. He Naikang and others were returned to custody, and subpoenas will be issued to witnesses for another scheduled court hearing. In addition, He Naikang's mother, He Zhou, published a large number of grievances yesterday (17th), defending her son on the grounds that he was falsely accused of murder and wrongly sentenced.</p>
<p>Wuxi Qu Shus Large Petition</p>
<p>The county government of this county recently approved a letter from the county party department to abolish the district book collection fee in order to reduce the burden on the people. After learning of this, the bookers believed that if the collection of books were abolished while their duties remained the same, their livelihoods would be at risk. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, they elected petition representatives Shi Shouxuan, Wang Hanchen, Zhang Gongmei, Mao Fengming and other representatives. Ten people led more than 400 district officials to the county party department to petition for relief. Gao Zugao received them and promised to forward the letter to the county government for review. Then, they went to the county government to petition. Section Chief Huang received them and relayed to the representatives that the district officials will be allowed to continue under the old system until the land survey is completed and the district officials' positions are not abolished. The representatives were satisfied and withdrew.</p>
<p>Changzhou Murderer Who Strangled His Nephew Sentenced to Death</p>
<p>Tan Guangyu, a villager from the Nanmin Weixiang township in the third district of Wu County, was strangled by his uncles, Tan Falong and Tan Faming, for fighting over inheritance. During a night patrol last winter, they strangled Guangyu and threw his body into the river. The body was later recovered, and the murderers, Tan Falong and Tan Faming, were arrested and sent to the District Court Procuratorate for investigation. After repeated investigations, the debate was declared closed and the sentencing was scheduled for the 16th. The main text stated that Tan Falong was sentenced to death for the crime of joint murder, and Tan Faming was sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang National Goods Year Opening Ceremony Scheduled.</p>
<p>The Jiangsu National Goods Year opening ceremony will be held in the Provincial Party Department Auditorium at 9:00 a.m. on the 25th of this month. At the same time, a parade will be held at the Provincial Public Stadium, and a lantern parade will be held in the evening.

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Donation and Tax Supervision Committee, because the local budgets of each county in this province for the 25th year have been successively compiled and sent to the province, previously sent a letter to the Ministry of Finance, proposing to order the hall to participate in the review, and the Ministry of Finance has approved it. It is now known that the Financial Hall has received the Ministry's order and expressed its welcome, because it will be helpful in abolishing excessive taxes and reducing surcharges, and has written to the Association to immediately send members to participate in the review. At the same time, the compensation money for the four batches of excessive taxes abolished can also be discussed together.</p>
<p>Yangzhou District Court Appoints and Dismisses Officials</p>
<p>After Guo Wei took office as the President of Jiangdu District Court, Luo Ren, the general affairs officer, and Han Zhumin, the dispatch officer, and Su Zesheng, successively left their posts. Guo Mutiang, who came with him, was specially appointed as the general affairs officer, and Zhang Baonan was appointed as the chief of dispatch, and Chen Yuru, the original dispatch officer, was transferred to dispatch. It is also known that Zhang Liqing, the student clerk of the court, was also dismissed at the same time. The bailiffs, Ma Qingbo and Liu Yongyu, also left their posts, and President Guo appointed Ji Chengzhe and Xiong Tujun as bailiffs, and reported to the High Court today (16th).</p>
<p>Gaoyou Bandits Rampant, Two Robberies</p>
<p>Bandits have been rampant in this county recently, and robbery cases have occurred repeatedly. There have now been two robbery cases, described as follows:</p>
<p>*   At 2:00 a.m. yesterday (12th), eight bandits, each carrying guns, swords, broke into the home of Qiu Changxiao, a villager in the Qili township in the fifth district. The family members were awakened from their dreams. The bandits first tied up Geng Yong with ropes, then robbed 51 yuan in silver dollars and clothes and other items from the boxes in the room, before leaving. Geng has reported to the county government, requesting a strict investigation of the bandits.</p>
<p>*   Around 10:00 p.m. the other day, two bandit ships, carrying more than a dozen bandits armed with guns, came to the home of Lu Chenzhi and Wang Longkou in Donggou, Gonghu township, in the second district. The bandits searched the Wang family for a long time, but found no silver dollars, only stealing clothes and jewelry worth more than 100 yuan. When the bandits left, one of them fell behind. Wang immediately invited neighbors to pursue them. The bandit then fired a shot, hitting neighbor Xu Er's head. Wang and others dared not pursue them further, and the bandit was able to escape leisurely.</p>
<p>Nantong Clearing District's Accumulated Opium Cases</p>
<p>The cases of trafficking opium in the counties of Tong, Ru, Hai, Chong, Qi, and Jing under the Nantong District Hall are all under the jurisdiction of the Commissioner's Office Military Law Office for trial. Because the counties are constantly sending prisoners, there are many accumulated cases, and the male and female prisoners in the detention center are extremely crowded. Commissioner Ge is implementing a clearance, and Military Law Officer Zhu Feiru is expediting the resolution. Once a case is closed, it will be returned to the original county for execution.</p>
<p>Strange Kidnapping and Arson</p>
<p>Ge Jinfeng, a girl from Guanyin Mountain, was betrothed to Qian Lifan. Recently, something changed. The Qian family then gathered a crowd to kidnap the bride and hid the Ge girl in Cheng Rongshou's house. The Ge family then invited relatives and friends, such as Luo Huiyi, to Cheng's house in an attempt to snatch her back. Because they could not find her, they set fire to the house, hoping that the Ge girl would run out so that they could snatch her back, but they still did not see her. Cheng Rongshou accused Luo Huiyi. The court opened the trial on the 14th, and Luo and others were released on bail.</p>
<p>Guard Accidentally Kills Merchant</p>
<p>Mao Ganru, the班長 (squad leader) of the Yushu Baochang guard post, led his patrol officers on patrol at midnight. They went to Zhang's tofu shop to eat tofu soup. The rifle of guard Shi Fengfei accidentally discharged, and the bullet entered the adjacent Li Tongmao store. The shop owner was settling accounts, and the bullet hit a vital point, killing him on the spot. Shi Fengfei was taken into custody by the court.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Haimen Pond Presents a Dangerous Situation</p>
<p>Near Guanyintang in the North River of Hangzhou City, the soil embankment was destroyed by the surge of the Qiantang River spring tide, and the farmland was flooded, which was very dangerous. Zhou Zhenlun, Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, went to investigate in person on the afternoon of the 17th, intending to ask the city government to allocate money to build a dam for defense. Also, the Tangjiao of the Hangping Section Bingzi Haimen Pond was destroyed by the water, and cracks were found in the Tangjiao. The Water Conservancy Bureau has rushed to repair it. Also, the Duzi Tang body is tilted outward, and the Tangjiao is empty, which is extremely dangerous. The Water Conservancy Bureau specially telegraphed the Construction Department to allocate money for repairs.</p>
<p>Central Savings Association Establishes Branch</p>
<p>The Central Savings Association opened in Shanghai on the 16th. Hangzhou has decided to set up a branch and has appointed Zhang Shaofu as the director, responsible for preparations. The address is located at the original site of the Wanguo Savings Association in Chenchang Money Shop in Zhubao Lane. It is expected to open on the 24th of this month. There are many depositors of the Chinese and French Savings Association in Hangzhou, who will all be transferred to the Association.</p>
<p>City Government Takes Over West Lake Auditorium</p>

<h3 id="e90">Travelogue of Han and Yue (7) <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Junhao</p>
<p>(Travel Correspondence from Our Reporter)</p>
<p>From Hengyang to Chenzhou Pingshi</p>
<p>On the morning of the eighth, I and others took the Zhushao Railway Engineering Automobile from Hengyang and headed towards Laiyang and Chenzhou, with Pingshi as the destination. Zhou Xia and Nie, three engineering inspectors from the Ministry of Railways, traveled with us. They were all going to Chenzhou to supervise the construction. The road from Hengyang to Chenzhou has already been opened to traffic, but the train runs slowly because the track is newly built. It will take until dusk to reach Chenzhou. According to our planned itinerary, we had to reach Pingshi today, so we continued to advance along the Xiang Province Highway in the engineering automobile. After departing from Bai Hengyang, the land gradually moved south, the climate became warmer, and the sky was clear today, making the car very comfortable. On the way, we sometimes saw the railway line crossing the highway. The highway can be bent according to the terrain, while the railway focuses on cutting off bays and taking shortcuts, so it cannot be too curved. The car passed Laiyang without stopping and continued to advance, arriving in Chenzhou at noon.</p>
<p>Bangzhou is a large city in southern Hunan. Because it is close to Guangdong Province, with overlapping peaks and mountains, the area is known for its instability. The communists Zhu and Mao first launched their uprising here. Li Zongbao, who has now returned to the Central Government, was very famous in the Red Army, and is said to be from Chenzhou. After getting off the car at the highway station, we first went to the Fourth Engineering Section of the Zhushao Railway Bureau to meet Chief Engineer Liu Baoshan. The three Ministry of Railways inspectors were temporarily stationed here. After lunch in the section, we were led by engineer Tan Yi to visit the historical sites of Chenzhou, which have great value. There is the Three Perfections Stele, with lyrics by Qin Shaoyou, paintings by Mi Nangong, and carvings by Su Ziyou. It is called the Three Perfections, but the text on the stele is too worn, and it is difficult to identify without careful examination and reference to ancient books. Mr. Tan said that he is on good terms with a principal of a Chenzhou middle school, and learned the original text from him, and eagerly copied it as follows:</p>
<p>Mist loses the terraces, the moon confuses the ferry, where can we hope to reach Peach Blossom Spring? How can one endure the cold of spring in this lonely inn, amid the rhododendrons and the setting sun?</p>
<p>Postal service sends plum blossoms, fish deliver letters, layer upon layer of regrets are accumulated. Chen River originally circles Chen Mountain, for whom does it flow down to Xiaoxiang?</p>
<p>In addition, there is the Su Xian Pavilion, the story of which is detailed in Ancient and Modern Wonders. Roughly, it is said that Su Dan's mother conceived because she was touched by a fairy, and gave birth to Dan. After Dan grew up, he rode a crane to become an immortal. To this day, there is a fairy stone on the pavilion, with the claw marks of the crane still on the stone. There is also the Orange Well Temple. It is said that Su Dan's mother left a message before her death that Chenzhou would definitely have a major epidemic next year. If the orange leaves are taken from the water in the well and drunk, it can be resolved. Later, her words were verified. The site of the well still exists today, and the word "Orange Well" commonly used by doctors originated from this, it is said. In addition to the above, there is also the Tomb of Emperor Yi, a story of Han Gaozu and Xiang Yu. The Yi Fish Pavilion is a story of Han Yu passing through Chenzhou on his southern exile. All of the above are mostly myths, but it goes without saying that Chenzhou has a long history. The Chen County Government cooperates well with the railway, and even asked the engineering section to plan roads for the local area, one built along the mountains, and one running through the urban area, which is connected to the Chenzi Highway. Everything is now in full swing.</p>
<p>Chenzhou also has a hot spring, six huai away from the station. Because we still had time, we asked Mr. Tan to guide us on a tour of the hot spring. It is said that this spring was discovered by Tan Yanyue, and he bathed here when he was in Changsha. We still took a car for 20 minutes, and then walked for 20 minutes to reach the spring. The spring is at the foot of a small mountain, bubbling endlessly all year round. The water is slightly warm and rich in minerals. However, the facilities are very simple. The bath pool is square and open-air, with a tile roof and short walls around it. When we arrived, there were more than a dozen villagers naked, pounding bricks, which was very unsightly. After the patrol police persuaded them to leave, we were able to see the pool in detail. There is probably only one spring stream, but the water is very strong. I tried to explore it with my hand, and the water temperature seemed to be similar to the Tangshan hot spring in Nanjing. The road bureau is now planning to open a road from the station to here. The surrounding trees are lush and the environment is not bad. If we add management and set up exquisite bathtubs, Chenzhou, with this hot spring and the above-mentioned attractions, will surely attract many tourists.</p>
<p>After visiting the hot spring, we continued to move forward in the original car. At this time, the car was driving on the mountain, and the slope was very steep. Because the border between Hunan and Guangdong has many mountains, the highway follows the mountain trend. At 4:00 p.m., we passed Yizhang and saw a avenue by the roadside. We stopped the car to watch. The avenue was very wide, and all of the stone panels are neatly paved, with rows of ancient pine trees on both sides. The branches and leaves are green and lush, and it is endless. It is impossible to plant these ancient pine trees in less than one or two hundred years. The most amazing thing is that this method of planting trees and paving roads is no different from modern urban design, which shows that the civilization of ancient Chinese architecture is worthy of our admiration. The driver said that this avenue is called Chenzhou Avenue, and it can go directly from Chenzhou to Yizhang, but the history of the avenue still needs to be investigated, and there is nothing to write about in the journey. From this all the way down, the scenery is better and better. There are countless numbers of people carrying salt to the north on the way, no less than several hundred people, all of whom are selling salt from Guangdong Province to Hunan. The car went further, and after passing Xiaotang Station, it was the boundary of Guangdong Province. The highway in Guangdong Province is extremely steep, and the road turns with the mountains, circling back and forth, forming a large loop. The car was driving almost on the top of the mountain. Looking down to the left and right, the small mountains were all under our feet. If the driver had not handled it properly, there would have been many dangers. After entering Guangdong, we soon arrived at Pingshi, where the Third Engineering Section of the Zhushao Railway Bureau is located. The office buildings are built on small hills, and the green peaks are in pieces from a distance. The scenery is extremely beautiful and natural. That night, we stayed in the engineering section.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Ambassador Liu's Observations: A Major European War Unlikely to Erupt <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, China's Ambassador to Italy, Liu Wendao, traveled to Hangzhou on the 15th and then to Moganshan to visit Huang Yingbai. That evening, he came to Shanghai to proceed to Nanjing, where he successively met with Chairman Lin, President Chiang, and Foreign Minister Zhang. He also attended the Central Memorial Week. On the afternoon of the 16th, at 5 PM, he left Nanjing to return to Shanghai, arriving here around 10:30 PM that night and going directly to his private residence on Haig Road to rest. On the evening of the 17th, at 7 PM, he hosted a banquet at his private residence for the Italian Ambassador to China, Aloisi, the Consul General in Shanghai, Nielong, and senior officials from the embassy and consulate. Liu had originally planned to go to Hangzhou on the 19th at the invitation of the Central Aviation School to give a lecture on international issues, returning to Shanghai that evening or the next morning. On the 20th, he was to attend a banquet hosted by Mayor Wu. On the 22nd, he would take a night train to Nanjing to meet with Chairman Lin, President Chiang, and Foreign Minister Zhang again to receive further instructions and bid farewell. After a one-day stay in Nanjing, he would return to Shanghai. On the 24th, he would attend a banquet on the Italian mail ship Victoria, and on the 26th, he would board the Victoria to return to his post in Italy. Mrs. Liu decided to postpone her departure for a few months due to her recent childbirth. As for the newly appointed Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Italy, Shen Zutong, who had originally planned to accompany Liu on the same ship, he also decided to postpone his departure until the 24th of next month, when he will travel with his family on the Italian mail ship Conte Verde, due to some private matters at home. Shen flew from Nanjing to Xi'an on the 17th to meet with Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang and returned to Nanjing on the 19th to await Liu's audience. When a reporter visited Liu on the morning of the 17th to inquire about the developments in the European situation, Liu declined to comment, only saying that the European countries deeply felt the pain of the European War and were unwilling to rekindle the flames of war. Furthermore, the current opposing fronts in Europe are not clear, and the strength is not balanced. Therefore, in his observation, the possibility of a second major war breaking out is more than 90%. As for his decision to go to Hangzhou to visit Huang Yingbai, it was because they had not met for many years, so he made a special trip to reminisce about old times, and there were absolutely no other missions.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Advocates Commercial Rectification Movement <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, upon receiving a letter from the Shanghai Silk Industry Association, stated that Huahua Silk Company proposed that businesses in the same industry cut prices and compete for sales and use false advertising to deceive customers, requesting that measures be taken to ban such practices. The City Chamber of Commerce believes that this kind of false competition is rampant in the market. In recent months, the Chamber has also frequently received letters from customers in other cities entrusting the Chamber to inquire about cases of receiving money but not shipping goods, and false low prices. The Chamber believes that this kind of loss of commercial ethics should be strictly rectified. Yesterday, it specifically issued a notice to merchants and submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry to stipulate penalties to maintain commercial regulations. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Notice to Merchants</p>
<p>To all store managers and supervisors in the city: The morality of Chinese merchants has always been respected by both domestic and foreign parties. Therefore, "genuine goods at fair prices" and "no deception of the old or young" have been popular terms in the business world for hundreds of years. In recent years, the market has been sluggish, and business has become increasingly difficult. Therefore, each store, in order to struggle for survival, invariably does not hesitate to use all extraordinary means in order to attract customers. There are so-called "buy one get one free," "buy one get two free," and even, according to the report of the Silk Industry Association, advertised sales of fine satin at a price of one cent per foot. Consider that merchants seek profit from capital, and at least they must preserve their capital. Such behavior that harms others and does not benefit oneself is not only a public enemy to the same industry, but also inevitably artificial and deceptive to customers. Although some customers who are greedy for small gains may be used by them, they can only deceive for a while. Over time, the public will spread rumors, the tricks will be exposed, and in the end, no one will ask about them. Therefore, wanting to rely on these extraordinary means to maintain and develop business is tantamount to abandoning a smooth road and heading towards a dead end. Since ancient times, the success of a merchant's career has no other secret. It is nothing more than encouraging oneself with caution and diligence, treating others with fairness and clarity, treating customers with humility, and treating the same industry with mutual assistance. If the above principles are abandoned and new patterns are desired, there is no one who will not stumble and fall. This Chamber, as the leader of the city's business community, shares the same fate and speaks with sincerity. From now on, correct mistakes if there are any, and strive harder if there are none. This notice.</p>
<p>Document Submitted to the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>Submitted for the matter of submitting a request, (excerpt) It has been found that stores use fraudulent methods to attract customers or use improper means to undermine each other. Your Ministry issued instruction number 40287, ordering the City Social Affairs Bureau to ban and punish such practices, and the industry rules established by various industries in the city and filed with the competent authorities also have similar public restrictions. Those who violate the rules may have the trade association formulate penalty measures and submit them to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval and execution. However, the commercial center of this city is located in the concessions. The Social Affairs Bureau's decision to ban and punish those who violate industry rules is difficult to implement due to the limitations of the established international situation. Therefore, Your Ministry's instruction number 40287 and the current request of the trade association are consistent in substance. However, the difficulty lies in how to eliminate the obstacles to banning and punishing. It has been found that in the concessions, the execution of administrative penalties is mostly entrusted to the Special District Court. For example, in the case of stamp tax violations, when the mainland was still organizing a violation case hearing committee under the tax bureau to hear and punish the case, the concessions first handled it through the Special District Court. This is because the administrative power in the concessions is limited, and there is no way to provide relief except in this way. In the future, in the case of violations of industry rules in the concessions, if we can follow the stamp tax precedent and change the hearing and punishment to be executed by the Special District Court, it concerns the maintenance of the entire commercial regulations. It is appropriate to prepare a document and request your Ministry to examine, approve, and instruct to comply. This is truly in the public interest.</p>
<p>Reply to the Silk Industry</p>
<p>Replying directly, we received your association's letter regarding the matter of various industries using dishonest means to entice customers, requesting that the government investigate and ban such practices and notify various industries to stop them. We have noted the details. It has been found that these malpractices are prohibited in the industry rules that have been submitted and approved by various industries. All trade associations are deeply distressed by this matter. Moreover, the Ministry of Industry's instruction number 40287 also ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to strictly ban and punish such practices, and those who violate industry rules may formulate penalty measures and submit them to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval and execution. However, the most difficult point in this case is that the shops opened in the concessions, whether they are members of the trade association or not, are bound by the established international situation, and the Social Affairs Bureau cannot exercise its power to ban and punish them. Today, in order to eliminate obstacles, we should start from this point. This Chamber has already submitted a separate document to the Ministry of Industry based on your association's letter to plan effective measures. On the other hand, it has also issued a notice to merchants in order to encourage mutual vigilance. It is appropriate to reply and request your attention.</p>
<h3 id="e96">French Concession Taxpayers' Association Suggests Increasing the Number of Chinese Directors <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>According to Shenshi News Agency, the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association believes that the number of Chinese residents in the concession is increasing daily. According to the investigation report, it is nearly 500,000 people. These 500,000 people directly bear the responsibility of paying taxes, and their relationship with the prosperity or decline of the concession's businesses is extremely close. Therefore, representatives of these 500,000 people cannot be lacking. Currently, there are only five Chinese directors attending the concession's board, which must be increased in fact to gather ideas and benefit widely. Increasing the number of Chinese directors attending the board is extremely fair in terms of the proportion of taxes paid. The association also believes that education is considered important by all, regardless of Chinese or foreign. Moreover, Chinese residents in the concession account for an absolute majority, but the board's establishment of Chinese children's schools is very few. Although there are several private schools that have obtained subsidies to establish Chinese schools, they are not widespread, resulting in incomplete equipment. The reason is that the funds in the French Concession are too small, limiting the number of children who can receive a good education. It is requested that the proportion of Chinese funds be increased. Both of the above points have been submitted to the French Municipal Council, requesting that they be forwarded to the French Consul General in Shanghai for review and approval.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Mr. Fritz's Lecture: Modern Long-Distance Telephone <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>According to a National News Agency dispatch from Shanghai on the 17th, the China Branch of the Institute of Electrical Engineers held an academic lecture yesterday afternoon at the Lester Institute of Technology. Mr. Fritz was specially invited to lecture on "Modern Long-Distance Telephone." The audience included members of the Chinese Institute of Engineers. Mr. Fritz said that although various problems related to long-distance telephone have been studied in electrical engineering laboratories for more than 50 years, there was no significant progress until between 1912 and 1915. After the European War, the United Kingdom and the European continent began to conduct considerable experiments. In terms of international aspects, after the President of the Institute of Electrical Engineers, Mr. Gill (Mr. Gill also resided in Shanghai), called attention to long-distance telephone in his inaugural speech, Europe officially began to plan the development of long-distance telephone lines. Later, the International Telephone Discussion Committee was established in Paris, which also made considerable contributions to long-distance telephone. In the past 15 years, the world has invested no less than 30 million pounds in long-distance telephone. The telephone networks between European countries are expanding day by day. In 1927, the scope of long-distance telephone was expanded with wireless electricity. Initially, there was communication between Europe and the United States, and the progress was very rapid. It has changed from long wave to short wave. In 1928, passengers in boats and vehicles were able to enjoy the convenience of telephone. Transatlantic mail ships can communicate with London, New York, and various places on the mainland. Now China has a network covering nine provinces, and plans have been made for future expansion. A line between Shanghai and Guangzhou is being laid. The most difficult problems in telephone engineering are echoes, distortion, and noise. Now there are considerable solutions. Today, there are 33 million telephone users worldwide. The hope of Shanghai communicating with the farthest places in the world is not far away. In short, the task of telephone engineers is to reduce engineering costs and increase efficiency, because long-distance telephone is really necessary for the business community and the convenience of the public, and it is not just a luxury for the rich.</p>

The meeting place was decorated extremely simply and solemnly. No less than a thousand people from all walks of life and the Chinese medicine community attended. Party and government agencies sent representatives to attend and guide. The meeting adjourned at 4 PM. The details are recorded as follows: Those who attended included Mao Xiaxuan from the City Party Headquarters, Wu Liguo from the Municipal Government, Zhong Zhiqi from the Health Bureau, Nie Haifan from the Education Bureau, Mao Shenghe from the Social Affairs Bureau, Lin Kanghou from the National Federation of Commerce (represented by Tao Leqin), Ding Zhongying from the Shanghai Branch of the Central National Medical Museum (represented by Ye Jinqiu), Zhu Shoupeng from the National Medicine Chunqiu Society, Ding Boan from the Guangyi Shantang, Shen Shenxiu from the Kunshan Chinese Medicine Association, and all members of the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Association, Shanghai Chinese Medical Society, Chinese National Medical Society, Shenzhou National Medical Society, and the Shanghai Chinese Pharmaceutical Industry Trade Union, as well as all teachers and students from the Chinese Medicine College and the China Medical College, totaling more than a thousand people.</p>
<p>Meeting Staff</p>
<p>Presidium: Xie Liheng, Xia Yingtang, Guo Boliang, Gu Weichuan, Ding Jiwan, Gao Zhiwen; Secretaries: Zhang Zanchen, Xu Ziming, Cheng Diren, Yu Tongfang, Fei Yongzuo; Master of Ceremonies: Huang Peisheng; Accountant: Xiao Tuian; Directors: Xue Wenyuan, Ding Zhongying, Qin Bowei, Shi Jiqun, Pan Yusheng, Bao Juxiang, Guo Zhongliang, Sheng Weizhou, Hong Juqing, He Yunsheng, Yu Hongsun, Song Furen, Shen Hefu, Qiu Yanling; Disciplinarians: All executive and supervisory committee members of the Chinese Pharmaceutical Industry Trade Union; Reception: Jiang Wenfang, Huang Saizhong, Sheng Xinru. After the ceremony, Chairman Xie Liheng delivered the opening remarks, saying that the establishment of a memorial day must have a meaning and its mission. On the static side, it is to make everyone not forget this day of historical value. On the dynamic side, it is to encourage everyone to work hard to expand the excitement given by this day, so that new life and new glory can reach the state of creation from excitement. Therefore, the arrival of a memorial day is a wake-up call for reflection, absolutely different from a story dramatized in such a plain way. When the second March 17th memorial arrives, due to reflection, we trace the historical facts of the March 17th memorial: 1. The national medical and pharmaceutical circles rose up and united to seek transformation on March 17th of the 18th year. 2. The Central National Medical Museum was officially established on March 17th of the 20th year. After the two meanings, the March 17th memorial day was produced. The mission of this memorial day is because imperialists invade weak nations, always using culture and economy as the vanguard of political and military aggression. Medicine and pharmacy are the two major tributaries of culture and economy. Where our duties lie, how can we wait with our hands tied? The first March 17th memorial became the date of general mobilization for the Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical circles to rise up together and stand on the front line of national struggle. The importance of the mission and the seriousness of the meaning are unparalleled. The second and third memorials should be exhibitions of battles, explorations of tactics, and replenishment of combat power, which is what was said earlier, to enable new life and new glory to reach the realm of creation through continuous exploration and replenishment.</p>
<p>Other Remarks</p>
<p>After the chairman's report, the representative of the City Party Headquarters, Mao Xiaxuan, delivered a speech, saying that he firmly believes that the enthusiastic celebration of the National Doctors' Day by the city's national medical community is a manifestation of the spirit of the national medical community. National medicine has a long history of thousands of years and has undeniable characteristics, but due to the conservative and mysterious thinking passed down from the past, national medicine has not been able to make full progress. In the future, this kind of concept should be broken, and scientific methods should be used to conduct open research, so that national medicine can make great progress. In the future, not only will it be valued by the general public in the country, but also countries around the world will be able to confirm that Chinese medicine and Taoism really have their unique characteristics that are beyond the reach of the medicine of various countries. Then, the representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, Mao Shenghe, delivered a speech, saying that the reason why national medicine in China has been able to continue for thousands of years without being replaced must have its characteristics. Today, countries around the world have paid attention to Chinese medical theory and are conducting practical research, which shows that Chinese medical theory really has the value of existence. He congratulated everyone on using past experiences and knowledge to strive for the improvement of national medicine, and there will definitely be unlimited hope in the future, and it will also have a great contribution to human health. There were also speeches by Nie Haifan of the City Education Bureau and Tao Leqin of the National Federation of Commerce, and the words were omitted from the length.</p>

This matter has been submitted to the 246th resolution meeting of this court, resolved and recorded. Please comply with the above.

<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission, located at 505 Henan Road, is a charitable organization that first advocated for construction and disaster relief in China. It was established in the tenth year of the Republic of China. Its branches and offices are now located in Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Sichuan, and Suiyuan provinces. Recently, due to the increasing scope of relief work, a Beijing office has been added in the capital to facilitate contact with various parties and benefit relief efforts.

<h3 id="e112">Two Charitable Organizations Jointly Conclude Winter Relief in Shuyang <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission and the Chinese Relief Society have jointly concluded the winter relief effort in Muyang, Jiangsu, and have submitted a report this month. A total of six townships in the seventh district, including Kelang, Lianhualongji, Baodang, Mengdun, and Zhouji, and eight townships in the eighth district, including Machang, Yanbei, Yannan, Fanwan, Xiping, Nanping, Zhongzheng, and Xiaodian, have been provided with assistance. The total number of people assisted was 12,200 adults and 7,531 children, with a total of 1,758 shi and 1 dou of corn distributed. In addition, 3,000 sets of cotton clothing were distributed in the 7th, 8th, and 9th districts and the urban area. Each person received only 9 sheng of corn, and only the poorest received a set of cotton clothing. The relief was minimal compared to the severity of the disaster, and could only save a few people. The winter period has just passed, and the spring famine is coming again. The people in the disaster area are starving and freezing all day long, and cannot avoid filling the gullies. According to the report from the eighth district of the county, the eighth district is located in eastern Shuyang, and the land is low-lying. It used to be one of the water towns. Every time there is a mountain flood, all the fields become swamps. Last autumn, the Yellow River breached its banks, and the flood flowed horizontally, turning the entire area into a sea. Villages and houses were destroyed. Fortunately, the two associations came to provide food and clothing last winter, which allowed the people to survive. At that time, the disaster victims either carried unwashed grain or sought help from relatives and friends, which could barely sustain them. Now that the flood has returned to the channel, there is a desire to return but no way to do so. There is a time for sowing seeds, but there is a shortage of millet. There is a need to complete the gathering, but there is no way to resist hunger. The actual number of households in this situation has reached more than 7,000, which is several times more than the number investigated during the fall. In this spring famine, the people are waiting to be fed. This situation is unbearable. Since food has been provided in the past, it is hoped that relief will come again in the future. We sincerely hope that people will be saved thoroughly, and we dare to present the disaster situation and plead for the people. In this spring famine, when hunger and cold are intertwined, how can people in the world rise up to provide relief and save the remaining lives in the gullies from death?</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce responded yesterday to a letter from the Engineering and Construction Industry Association regarding the matter of whether trade certificates issued by the association need to be stamped, stating, "We have received your letter of the 16th of this month, stating that your association must issue a certificate before members of the industry register with the Bureau of Public Works. You have requested that we investigate whether this certificate should be stamped. Article 1 of the Stamp Tax Law stipulates that all types of certificates stipulated in this law shall pay stamp tax in accordance with this law. In other words, certificates not stipulated in this law are not required to be stamped. This is one of the main points of this law that should be recognized first. Item 28 of Article 16 of the Stamp Tax Law, 'Certificates for proving identity or qualifications,' states under the heading 'Nature' that all types of certificates and licenses issued by the competent authorities to prove the identity or qualifications of the people fall under this category. Therefore, the stamping of certificates under this item is limited to those issued by the competent authorities. Certificates not issued by the government are not within the scope of this item and are not required to be stamped according to law."</p>

<p>The capital of the official-merchant joint venture China Paper Manufacturing Company, which is presided over by the Ministry of Industry, has been estimated by experts to be a total of 4.5 million yuan in national currency, of which 600,000 yuan are merchant shares and 3.9 million yuan are official shares. The merchant shares have been determined by the preparatory committees and publicly offered. The official shares are borrowed from the Gengzi Indemnity. The previous rumors that all the funds of the Gengzi Indemnity were used for cultural affairs are no longer a problem. It is only necessary for the authorities of the Gengzi Indemnity to review and approve the company's plan, and the funds can be allocated in full. Liu Weichi, the director of the company's preparation, believes that after the factory is established, the amount of raw materials used will be very large. Although there is a large production of Wenzhou wood, it is feared that demand will exceed supply. In order to ensure that the raw materials will be inexhaustible in the future, it has been decided to plan forests before the factory is completed, so as to enrich the source of raw materials and not be subject to lack of panic.</p>

<p>After the opening of the Central Savings Association the day before yesterday, although it was rainy yesterday, savers went to the association to subscribe for savings enthusiastically. The association will hold the first lottery at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on April 15. Generally, savers need to have 50,000 numbers to have a special prize of 25,000 yuan. Now, in order to give preferential treatment to new savers, the association will also issue 25,000 yuan if there are not enough 50,000 numbers. In the future, the number of lottery numbers will gradually increase to 50,000 yuan if it exceeds 50,000 numbers. Now that the association is just starting, there are not many numbers included in the lottery, so it is easy to win. In addition, the association's regulations have various preferential features for savers that are different from previous savings associations, so savers are vying to join.</p>
<h3 id="e123">China Industrial Gas Company - Successful Experiment in Self-Made Calcium Carbide <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The China Industrial Gas Company, located at 537 Liaoyang Road, has been established for many years, producing industrial raw materials such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and light gas, which have long been sold throughout the country and have earned a good reputation. Later, due to calcium carbide being a necessity for the welding industry and a major raw material for manufacturing carbon dioxide and other industrial products such as acetic acid, alcohol, fertilizer, glue, graphite, etc., it was previously imported in large quantities. Since there were no domestically produced goods, the company was always subject to foreign control. Therefore, several years ago, the company planned to produce its own, and after arduous efforts, it was finally produced in February of this year. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited the factory and saw the calcium carbide produced. According to Guo Chengen, the chairman of the company, the electricity consumption is no less than four or five times cheaper per unit than using hydroelectric power from foreign countries. The production costs are being reduced. However, the original motivation for self-manufacturing was to stop the leakages and strive for self-reliance, and all the raw materials used are domestic products. Therefore, the company does not hesitate to make significant sacrifices to conduct an industrial experiment, and it will continue to research and gradually improve in the hope that this industrial raw material can be self-sufficient.</p>

<p>Since the implementation of the new regulations for telephones in the First Special District, various industries have been greatly affected. Therefore, the Municipal Federation of the First Special District convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon and decided to hold a special telephone users' conference to discuss countermeasures. The Telephone Issues Committee of the First Special District sent a letter to apartment building operators yesterday, asking them to unite and refuse to pay the fees and allow the telephones to be removed. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Scheduled Users' Conference</p>
<p>The Municipal Federation of the First Special District held an emergency meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday regarding the issue of telephone price increases in the Special District. More than twenty people attended, including Tao Leqin, Zhang Xianfang, Li Aokui, Yu Yaoqiu, Liu Zhongying, Lu Wenzhong, Cao Zhigong, Zhu Baoluo, Zheng Dongshan, and Chen Jiufeng. Zhang Yichen chaired the meeting. Tao Leqin first reported on the measures to deal with the telephone price increases, and then they discussed (1) the case of the telephone price increases in the Special District. It was resolved that, regardless of whether it is the basic or excess number, a fee of three cents should be charged for each number. Otherwise, refusal to pay the fee would be a sign of protest. (2) A telephone user conference for the district would be scheduled to carry this out together. The case of strictly regulating the qualifications of candidates for representatives of Chinese taxpayer groups was resolved. A letter would be sent to the Taxpayers Association to handle it in accordance with the announcement of March 8. (3) The municipal party headquarters ordered a general promotion of the use of domestic goods. It was resolved to forward the order to all district branches for compliance. The Telephone Issues Committee of the First Special District sent a letter to the apartment building industry yesterday, stating, "We have received a letter from the Municipal Federation of the First Special District, which was forwarded from your industry (omitted). We are requesting assistance, etc. We believe that the Shanghai Telephone Company, regardless of the current difficulties, has changed prices in disguise. Since the implementation, various industries have suffered greatly. In order to implement our proposals, the association has already formulated the final resistance measures, which will involve the united efforts of all sectors. As for your industry's economic struggles, we deeply admire them. We are writing to you to ask you to unite the entire industry and remove the telephones together in order to promote the company's awareness and achieve a final victory.

<p>In the autumn of 1934, they departed from Warsaw, the capital of Poland, via Berlin, Bourg Land, Vienna, Safia, Constantinople, Cola, Arapu, Badastan, Dehelen, Guopei, Delhi Sea, Bombay, Benares, Calcutta, and Rangoon, and then entered China via Longzhou, a border town in Guangxi, through Hanoi and Dong Dang in Annam. Then they followed the Guangxi Highway to Nanning, Wuzhou, and then to Guangzhou before transferring to Shantou and coming to Shanghai. They arrived in Shanghai on the 16th and stayed at the Polish Overseas Chinese Association. Yesterday, a reporter visited them. The Polish couple was covered in dust, and the motorized bicycle they were riding was covered in yellow mud, which was a testament to their hard work on the journey. According to them, this journey relied entirely on this motorized bicycle as a means of transportation. Since departing from Warsaw on August 23, 1934, to the day they arrived in Shanghai, they have traveled 34,300 kilometers, crossing the Great Desert and various tropical regions. Although the journey was extremely difficult, they were able to personally experience various countries and investigate their social customs, which was infinitely interesting. Before departure, they received introductions from the embassy in your country, and after entering your country, they received various conveniences from the authorities of various provinces, for which we are deeply grateful. The scenery of your country is beautiful, and the cultural relics are rich, which makes people have infinite admiration. They planned to rest in Shanghai for a while, and then take the original bicycle to visit various ports in your country, expecting to stay in China for a year before returning home. When we stayed in Nanning, we were specially entertained by Huang Xuchu, the chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, and toured various places. The trip from Longzhou to Shanghai, including the stopovers along the way, took a total of twenty-three days. We are correspondents for the Warsaw newspaper in Poland, and we will attach photos of what we have seen along the way and send them back to our country for publication. When asked about the situation of Polish newspapers, they said that Polish newspapers are now very developed. There are fifteen famous daily newspapers in Warsaw, and the largest circulation is 250,000 copies per day. The newspaper we represent has two daily newspapers, two evening newspapers, and four weekly newspapers, for a total of seven. They also said that after we came to your country, we ate your country's meals every day, which have a unique flavor and are inexhaustible. It is truly the most famous food in the world. The motorcycle we ride is a Three Guns brand motorcycle, which is sturdy and durable. It has traveled tens of thousands of miles and is still intact. What is even more amazing is that the Dunlop tires we used when we set off from Poland have not been changed, which can also be introduced.</p>

<p>In order to dredge the Divine Shoal at the mouth of the Yangtze River outside the Wusong Estuary, the Shanghai Dredging Bureau ordered a giant mud dredging wheel called the Jianshe from Germany last year. It is currently working at the Divine Shoal. At the same time, the bureau continues to order another similar mud dredging wheel. The hull of the ship is larger than the Jianshe and the mud suction power is also increased. The bureau will start inviting merchants with extensive experience from all countries to bid for the construction today. The Datong News Agency reporter has recorded the situation as follows.</p>
<p>Completion of Divine Shoal</p>
<p>According to Dr. Chadley, the chief engineer of the bureau, the Divine Shoal has recently been completed. The dredging work on the shoal has reached two miles, and the amount of mud removed is estimated to be 500,000 cubic meters (4 tons per cubic meter). Work is still limited to daytime, and in the future, plans will be made to add nighttime work. The progress of the completion of the dredging is extremely smooth.</p>
<p>Addition of New Machine</p>
<p>The bureau plans to add a mud dredging wheel of the same size as the Jianshe. It is now possible to start inviting shipyards with extensive experience from all countries to construct the wheel. The hull of this mud dredging wheel should be slightly larger than the Jianshe. It is a seagoing suction dredger, which can operate normally without anchoring when it has a mud hold. It is the world's most advanced mud dredging wheel, personally designed by Chadley. Regarding the dredging efficiency, it only needs to work ten hours a day to dredge 20,000 cubic yards of solidified sand and mud in the Yangtze River and can continue to drive to a mud disposal site two miles away. After the bidding for the mud dredging wheel starts today, if European shipyards submit bidding letters, they must be sent from Siberia to expedite delivery and avoid delays. It is also learned that the magnitude and mud dredging efficiency of the wood-hulled mud dredging wheel will match any mud dredging wheel in the world.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Cancellation of Contract for Receiving Banknotes Still in Dispute - Twenty-Five Qian Zhuang File Suit - Continental Bank and President Ye Fuxiao Accused - Requesting Confirmation That Cancellation of Contract is Invalid and Compensation for Profits <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance reformed the currency system last winter, banks that had contracts with Qian Zhuang (traditional Chinese banks) to sell secretly marked banknotes (i.e., banknotes) generally wanted to take the opportunity to cancel the contracts, which led to lawsuits. For example, the Continental and Donglai banks had been sued for breach of contract by Qian Zhuang that were receiving the banknotes. The two banks then brought in people to mediate and resolve the disputes. However, before the Continental Bank was sued by Hua Feng and thirteen other Qian Zhuang, it had already canceled the contract for receiving banknotes with Bao Kang and twenty-five other Qian Zhuang. At that time, the Continental Bank told the Qian Zhuang receiving the banknotes that the contract signed under the instructions of the Ministry was no longer applicable to Bao Kang and other Qian Zhuang, who mistakenly believed that it was sincere. As a result, they accepted the unconditional cancellation of the contract. Later, after learning that the Continental Bank had been sued by Hua Feng and other Qian Zhuang, they learned that those with banknotes had settled the case, and they knew that the Continental Bank had done this. They felt that Ye Fuxiao, the president of the bank, should not have treated them differently, causing them unnecessary losses. Therefore, Bao Kang, Qing Kang, Yucheng, Hengmao, Hongfu, Yucheng, Lianyi, Hongkang, Hongchang, Hongda, Dingyuan, Lianxing, Yuanheng, Shuntai, Yongtai, Yucheng, Yongtai, Zhenxing, Tonghe, Hongmao, Qiantai, Shuntai, Yufeng, and Fukang, twenty-five Qian Zhuang jointly hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to sue the Continental Bank and its president, Ye Fuxiao, in the District Court of the First Special District. The plaintiffs stated that they had contracted to receive a total of 3.05 million yuan in banknotes, and the contract stipulated the important rights and obligations of both parties. The obligations of the plaintiffs were to promote the banknotes in accordance with the contract and deposit the reserve funds for the returned amount with the defendant. The obligations of the defendant were to pay interest at 40% of the reserve funds in accordance with the contract. Both parties fulfilled the contract without any problems. Unexpectedly, on November 4 of last year, they suddenly received a letter from the defendant stating that, due to the unified issuance and centralized preparation, the contract for receiving banknotes was no longer applicable and should be canceled immediately. After receiving the letter, the plaintiffs repeatedly consulted with the defendant to maintain the original contract, but the defendant refused, saying that the Ministry's instructions were no longer applicable, and who would dare to violate them? They also said that if they did not hand over the contract, they would not be paid the interest they were entitled to. The plaintiffs had inquired about the experiences of others who had contacted the defendant, and the answers were consistent. They believed that operating a bank required a strong sense of trust and that the defendant would not intentionally deceive them. Therefore, they reluctantly handed over the contracts that had not yet expired. However, the intention and behavior of handing over the contracts were not voluntary. The means by which the defendant carried out the contract can be said to be obvious. Although the plaintiffs were deceived for a while, they were not willing to accept it. Therefore, they investigated the truth of the Ministry's order and found that the plaintiffs had been fooled by the defendant. The order issued by the Ministry of Finance was only a few months old, and the Central China banknotes were still circulating in the market, which was clear evidence. Moreover, the Central Bank has now established regulations for receiving banknotes, which are no different from the regulations for receiving banknotes signed by the original parties. The defendant's letter falsely stated that the Ministry of Finance's order was not applicable to the regulations for receiving banknotes, which was fraudulent. The fact that the defendant was sued by the Zha Chang Zhuang and others in the High Court in the same case and knew that it was in the wrong, and that it had desperately begged people to reconcile with the plaintiff in the case and pay interest to settle the case, further proved that the defendant's cancellation</p>
<p>The original plaintiff's contract</p>
<p>Was an act of using fraud to exercise its rights under the law, and the act of fraudulently eliminating the rights of others should be confirmed as invalid. According to Article 92 of the Civil Code, if a declaration of intent is made due to fraud or coercion, the declarant may revoke his declaration of intent. Article 101, paragraph 2, states that if a party who benefits from the fulfillment of a condition improperly promotes the fulfillment of the condition, the condition shall be deemed not to have been fulfilled. Moreover, the previous judgment of the High Court stated that "fraud" in civil law refers to intentionally showing untruthful matters to the other party, causing them to fall into error and make a declaration of intent due to the error. Another previous judgment stated that if the establishment of a legal act</p>
<p>Due to fraud or coercion</p>
<p>To the extent that the declaration of intent made by the parties is not free, in order to protect the declarer, they should be allowed to revoke it. It is found that since the plaintiffs in this case signed the contract with the defendant, the obligations they have fulfilled have been considerable. Therefore, the existence of this contract has considerable rights to be recovered. If the defendant had not intentionally used fraud and threatened with the Ministry's order, the plaintiff would have been willing to abandon its rights and make a declaration of cancellation. The handing over of the contract by the plaintiffs was clearly not of their own free will, and the fulfillment of the condition of unconditional cancellation was purely promoted by the defendant's improper behavior. The condition of cancellation should be deemed not to have been fulfilled. Based on the above reasons, in accordance with the above-mentioned legal precedents, it is requested that the defendant be summoned to court to render a judgment confirming that the defendant's act of canceling the contract is</p>
<p>The act is invalid</p>
<p>And compensate the plaintiffs for the benefits they should have enjoyed under each contract and bear the litigation costs. The defendant then hired lawyers such as Wang Zhuan to file a statement of defense. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Mo Runhua of the First Special Court opened a court hearing. Zhan Jifeng, the plaintiff's attorney, first stated the intent of the lawsuit, saying that the guarantee money paid by the plaintiff in accordance with the contract was set at 40% in cash. Since the reform of the currency system, the defendant believed that the 40% in cash was also legal tender, and that from then on, banknotes would be exchanged for banknotes, and they did not want to pay the agreed interest. Therefore, they sent a letter to each plaintiff saying that they were acting on the order of the Ministry and had to cancel the contract, otherwise the interest before November 3 would not be paid. At that time, each plaintiff</p>
<p>Because the Ministry's order was difficult to disobey, each handed over the contract. However, other banknote recipients with better knowledge or thought, fearing that they would be deceived, sued the bank. As a result, the bank saw that it could not use threats and reconciled with them, paying all the interest. Later, the plaintiff learned that the Ministry of Finance had not issued any orders, so they negotiated with the defendant again. The defendant suddenly changed its tone and no longer said that it was acting on the order of the Ministry but said that it was due to the Ministry's order. This shows that the defendant was actually using a kind of tactic at that time to cancel the contract. Therefore, it is requested that the act of canceling the contract be confirmed as invalid, and that the defendant be ordered to pay the original interest of 85,667 yuan, 6 jiao, and 6 fen. The defendant's lawyer replied, first saying that the contract for receiving banknotes was based on the bank's right to issue banknotes,</p>
<p>Today's issuance is stopped</p>
<p>Since there is no need to promote sales, he went on to say that the plaintiff's cancellation of the contract was not accompanied by threats, fraud, or improper means. Finally, he said that the case of Fuchang and others suing the Continental Bank did not result in a reconciliation between the Continental Bank and the plaintiffs of the case automatically withdrew the lawsuit. The plaintiff's lawyer then refuted them one by one, saying that receiving banknotes and issuing banknotes were two completely different things. The defendant deliberately distorted the truth, and other banks that were no longer issuing banknotes were still continuing to fulfill the contract for receiving banknotes, and Donglai even signed a new one. As for the lawsuit filed by Fuchang and others, if the defendant had not paid interest to settle the case, how could it have been willing to withdraw halfway? In short, the defendant threatens those who are weak and reconciles with those who cannot be deceived. After both sides had finished arguing, Judge Mo decided to announce the judgment at noon on the 23rd of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Adventures of a Merchant Ship <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Merchant Ship Aground - Danger of Rising Tide - The Tongshang, a merchant ship of the Wengsi Shipping Company in this port, ran aground on Shiyezhou in the upper reaches of Zhenjiang due to the pilot miscalculating the channel. The stern of the ship was high on the shore, and the bow was submerged in the river. This was reported in this newspaper. Later, the company sent tugboats and barges to the vicinity of Gaozi to transfer all the cargo in the Tongshang in order to reduce the draft. Then, they repaired the hull and waited for the rising tide to prepare for towing. Recently, the river water has risen sharply, and the Tongshang has taken advantage of the rising tide and been towed out by a tugboat. It has already sailed downstream and docked at Pukou yesterday.</p>
<p>Taisun's Dangerous Crossing - Horrific Waves and Yellow Sand</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Taisun, which was returning to Shanghai from Shantou this time, was supposed to carry 5,000 bags of domestic sugar to Shanghai as usual. Unexpectedly, the bureau telegraphed the ship to go to Xiamen as well. Sugar merchants in Shantou stopped loading because the ship's detour to Xiamen would take more days. As a result, the Taisun sailed to Xiamen empty, thinking it could load cargo to ballast the ship. Unexpectedly, it only carried dozens of steerage passengers to Xiamen. When it left Xiamen and reached the waters off Fuzhou, it encountered a storm. The empty ship sailed in frightening winds and waves, and it was extremely dangerous. The ship's hull rose and fell suddenly, and the captain Jiang Changqing went through all kinds of hardships before avoiding an accident. However, the outer side of the iron plate had already been smashed with a hole by the storm showing the fierceness of the waves. Fortunately, it was filled in time and was able to continue sailing. When it reached the waters off Wenzhou, it encountered yellow sand covering the sea, making it impossible to see anything in front of it, similar to a heavy fog. Fortunately, Captain Jiang was familiar with the waterway and was not in danger. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday and was still trembling with fear when he spoke. The damaged hole in the hull has been reported to the head office for immediate repair.</p>

<p>Yang Xien, a local man, was nearly thirty years old and lived at No. 24 Zhujia Shed, Haige Road. During the day, he worked at the Shanghai Hospital on Haige Road. Because his residence and workplace were very close, Yang always walked back and forth in the morning and evening. The landlord of his residence was surnamed Tang. Yesterday, at around 6:00 PM, Yang finished work and returned home to prepare dinner. Unexpectedly, there were four bandits robbing the Tang's house at that time, and all the family members had been detained. Therefore, when Yang walked into the house, he was surprised to find that it was silent. Just as he was about to step into his own room, he did not expect that the bandits in the Tang's room were also withdrawing after the robbery at that time. In a panic, the bandits caught a glimpse of Yang Xien and thought that the matter had been leaked and detectives had arrived. They panicked and pulled out their pistols, firing three shots in a row, knocking Yang down. Tang Lingxun, the daughter of the landlord Tang, was also shot. The bandits then left the house and fled. When the bandits had gone far away, his family members ran out to see what had happened. They saw that Yang had been shot in the abdomen and Tang Lingxun had been shot in the leg. They were both bleeding profusely and unconscious. They immediately reported to the police station in charge and sent Yang and Tang to the hospital for treatment. At the same time, they inquired about the appearance of the bandits and searched for them everywhere. However, Yang Xien was fatally wounded and lost too much blood. He eventually died in the hospital at 11:15 PM and will be reported to the local court for inspection this morning.</p>

<p>Xiang Songshan, a villager from Xicun Village, Yangjing Township, Baoshan County, recently found a large clam on the beach, weighing four or five pounds. The shell was hard. After dissecting it, he saw a Maitreya Buddha statue on the inner layer of the clam shell, which was two inches square and protruding two minutes and zero. The eyes, ears, mouth, and nose were completely lifelike, and he held rosary beads in his hands, clasping them in meditation, with a lovable appearance, no different from a sculptor's carving. Xiang was overjoyed at obtaining this treasure and cherished it, unwilling to show it to others easily. He plans to wait for a good price to sell it. According to the February report of the Parks Management Office of the Public Works Department, the total number of visitors to the various parks and children's playgrounds this month was 151,500. The work of planting and transplanting flowers and trees in various parks continued as usual. However, there were many large trees in Zhaofeng Park that had grown beyond their plots, so they had to be moved to better locations. All the places that needed to be rearranged had been planned, which took a lot of effort. In addition, rare flowers bloomed in the greenhouse, vying for beauty. This greenhouse is open to the public every Saturday afternoon and all day Sunday. Unfortunately, few visitors know about this. As for other notable work in various parks, such as the rearrangement of the western part of the Bund Public Park to isolate it from the outside world to prevent idlers from standing and watching, which would spoil the visitors' enjoyment, and the planting of shade trees and short holly hedges on the vacant land where Weihaiwei Road and Fuxu Road meet, to create a quiet atmosphere in the midst of the noise. As for the sports grounds in various parks, due to the cold weather and frequent rain, business was very bleak.</p>

Afterwards, a Ningbo woman, Sun Fei, came forward to identify the man as her husband, Sun Dayuan, who worked as a painter at Ma Xiangji Paint Store on Jiujiang Road. He was on his way home from work that day and was mistakenly killed. Therefore, Sun Fei sued the constable for manslaughter. The Special First Court issued two summonses, but neither Sun Fei nor the constable appeared. This information has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui continued the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. Sun Fei appeared in court as summoned, stating that she was 28 years old and resided at 134 Xujiatang, Xiafei Road.

Cai recently married Hu, a woman from Suzhou, as his second wife. They live together at No. 16, Lane 583, Zhejiang Road. Hu is extremely fierce and abuses Yueying in every way, beating her severely several times, causing the girl to be covered in scars and bruises. She is also not given enough to eat, and her cries and the sound of whipping often reach outside the house. Cai is also bewitched by his wife's words and abets her in her cruelty. Kong Zaoxian and Qiu A'quan, who live in the same house, could not bear to watch and reported it to the Laozha Police Station, who sent Detective Qiu Sijiu to arrest Cai Wenxin and Cai Hu. Together with the iron hammer and clothes hanger used in the assault, they were handed over to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. This information has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Qian Hongye continued the hearing in the First Criminal Court. The police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, requested that the court release the forensic report for review.

The court then ordered Cai Yueying to be brought to the court to inquire about the source of the rope marks. She confessed that her mother tied her hands and neck with a rope because she was slow in doing things. The two defendants continued to deny everything. The court then summoned Cai Wenxin's brother, Wenbiao, to the court and asked if he could take Cai Yueying back to be cared for and educated instead of leaving her with Cai Wenxin. He replied that he could do so. After mutual arguments between the two lawyers, Judge Qian announced the verdict: Cai Hu was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for abusing a young girl and hindering her physical development. Cai Wenxin was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for the same crime, suspended for two years. During the probation period, he will be supervised by the police station. Cai Wenbiao was ordered to provide bail and submit a written request to the court to take Cai Yueying.</p>

<p>Feng Zhang, a widow aged 40 from Nanhui, residing at No. 94, Little Putuo Bridge in Nanshi, suddenly died suddenly on the seventh night of this year's lunar calendar. The local headman reported it to the local court, which sent someone to determine that Feng Zhang had died from poisoning, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that she was adopted as a child bride but unexpectedly, before she was formally married, her fiancé died of illness. She considered herself unlucky, practiced vegetarianism and worshipped Buddha, and endured hardship to maintain her chastity for over twenty years. Relatives and neighbors praised her. She usually spent her days chanting scriptures with Feng Songtao, an elderly man in his seventies. (Feng Songtao used to be a clerk at Jiu Ji Bei Zhan in Nanshi, but now he is too old to perform his duties, so his eldest son, Feng Zilin, has taken his place.) However, after the incident, Feng Zilin, the husband's elder brother of the deceased, noticed that the items in the room were in a mess, and the clothes in the box were all gone. Neighbors also testified that on the evening of the incident, at around 8:00 PM, Zhu A'er, a tailor who was the deceased's nephew, and a young man came to visit his aunt (the deceased). After the tragedy was discovered the next day, Zhu A'er and others disappeared without a trace. It is possible that Feng Zhang was designed to be poisoned by Zhu A'er and others. Therefore, he filed a complaint with the court requesting justice. Yesterday, Prosecutor Li Xulin ordered Feng Zilin to be summoned to court for questioning. Although it had been determined that Feng Zhang had died from poisoning, what kind of poison was still unknown. To clarify the truth, Feng Zilin was ordered to send Feng Zhang's coffin to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for an autopsy immediately. At the same time, Zhu A'er and others were ordered to be arrested for further investigation.</p>

At around 4:00 PM in the afternoon, Zhang Cailan went to Yao A'mao's teahouse with his friends Feng Huobiao, Chu A'luan, Hu Aisan, Xu A'er, Zhu Kefu, Chen Bingsheng, and Tang Jinquan. Unexpectedly, Lu Jigen and Yao A'mao had gathered many people in advance to wait in the teahouse. Upon seeing Zhang and the others arrive, they started beating each other without asking questions. As a result, Tang Jinquan (34 years old, from Changzhou, residing at No. 313, Jinfei Bridge Road) suffered knife wounds on his head, face, and legs and cried out in pain. Feng Huobiao (34 years old, from Shaoxing) was severely beaten on the head and face. Chu A'luan (32 years old, a local resident of No. 7, Qinren Lane, Xujiahui) fell into the river and was rescued.

<h3 id="e146">Letter from Lao Jiu He to Fellow Trade Associations <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Letter from Lao Jiu He to the Silk and Satin Trade Association regarding the sale of one foot for one cent: Esteemed Sirs, Having read in the newspapers of this month, the 12th, that your esteemed association believes that commercial ethics have been completely destroyed by fellow traders who do not abide by good faith, you have written to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to issue a call for guidance, and to jointly raise commercial ethics in order to save industry and commerce. This bureau sincerely expresses its sympathy. However, this bureau's business has always been based on the principle of long-term, low-price, and high-volume sales. Any special sacrifices are based on facts and truth. Therefore, the unethical behaviors mentioned in your letter, such as selling inferior goods, seeking exorbitant profits, and making false propaganda to deceive customers, are abhorrent to this bureau and have nothing to do with us. There is no need to argue. However, the phrase "even selling silk and satin for one cent to a few cents per foot" is a concern. Upon investigation, no fellow trader has made such a statement recently, except for this bureau. Considering the facts, your association's words are clearly directed at this bureau. However, although there is no such thing as buying one foot for one cent as a common practice in the market, this bureau has the fact of selling one foot for one cent, with accounting books and customers to inquire. (Omitted). In order to support your association's efforts to raise commercial ethics and eliminate false propaganda with facts, this bureau has decided to publicly sell 100 bolts of real silk spun silk for one cent per foot, limited to one zhang per person, from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM on the 19th of this month, in order to prove that this bureau's previous sale of one foot for one cent was not false, and to give those who claim to have far-sighted vision an even higher and farther understanding. Fearing that doubts will not be resolved and that right and wrong will not be distinguished, we have specially sent this letter to your esteemed association's chairman and request that you forward it to the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, inviting them to jointly come to the venue for supervision before 9:00 AM on the morning of that day in order to make a great declaration of faith. I believe that your esteemed association will treat all members equally and will not be biased or refuse this request. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Silk and Satin Trade Association.</p>

<p>Kangjian Bookstore Opens Today Kangjian Bookstore, located at No. 44, Xiafei Road, intersection of Luba Road, was founded by Kangjian Magazine. The magazine believes that there are many schools and a dense population in the western district. In addition to the Commercial Press, which has a branch on Xiafei Road, there are few other well-established bookstores. Therefore, Kangjian Bookstore was specially founded to meet the needs of people in West Shanghai. In addition to publishing books on medicine, health, and sports, the bookstore also sells general books from major bookstores. The bookstore has a very complete selection of books on medicine, health, and sports for purchase by all sectors. It also sells Chinese and foreign maps, various magazines, and all kinds of stationery and sports supplies. It is reported that there will be a major sale and free gift event for one month during the opening. Books published by the bookstore will be sold at half price, and foreign books will also be sold at 60% to 90% off. All stationery and sports supplies will be sold at 80% of the list price, and customers who purchase goods worth more than five jiao will receive an exquisite and practical gift as a souvenir.</p>

<p>Shanghai Telegraph Bureau Rehearses Peking Opera The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications Employees' Club will rehearse Peking Opera at the Lake Society on Beijing Road on the 21st of this month. The program is as follows: Tang Qifeng's "Nine Watches" (i.e., Ma Yi Saves the Lord), the scene where Ma Yi kills his daughter is the most exciting; Jin Shixin's "June Snow," the scene where the mother-in-law goes to the prison to deliver food to Dou E, is very realistic; Wang Jianzhong's "Wujiapo"; Wang Jintang and Zhu Huanwen's "Fenhe Bay"; Wang Pingshi's "Stealing the Soul Bell" is humorous, and Bajie's ecstatic look when he sees a beauty is the most amusing; Gu Decheng and Zhu Shouyi's "Lianhuan Tao"; Li Huying and Zhang Yihua's "Yutang Chun" perform the scene where Su San confesses her grievances, which has long been praised by opera lovers; Liu Junjie's "Beheading Hua Xiong" has unique features in both singing and acting; Heng Zhen and Lu Huijian's "Si Lang Visits His Mother" compare "the love between husband and wife" to everything in the universe, all of which must be great, and the song expresses it perfectly, which is very rare; Fan's "Hitting the Dragon Robe," etc. Madam Fan was famous in Peiping and is one of the four heroes of Huangpo, which is a rare opportunity for opera lovers. Because the club's venue cannot accommodate many people, admission tickets are sold for one yuan each as a restriction. It is also reported that the club has many valuable and exquisite gifts to give to guests. The admission tickets have numbers printed on them, and some of the numbers on the ticket corners will be drawn that night and prizes will be awarded accordingly.

<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>We have received a statement from our client, Tsai Chang-sheng, claiming that he read a news item in your newspaper, the Shen Bao, dated the 16th, under the local news section, titled "Dispute over Apprentices Leads to Open Armed Brawl," which mentions him as being present at the scene. He finds this utterly astonishing. Upon investigation, he asserts that on the morning of the 15th of this month, around 8:00 AM, he went to a friend's house in Pudong to discuss important matters and only returned home around 8:00 PM. The report is clearly inaccurate. Therefore, he has specifically entrusted your esteemed lawyer to send this letter, requesting a correction to avoid any misunderstanding. We hereby forward this correspondence and hope for your attention. Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>To the Editor of the Shen Bao,</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lawyer Yang Qianmao</p>
<p>March 17th</p>
<p>Esteemed Chief Editor of the Shen Bao:</p>
<p>I am writing to express my shock and dismay regarding the article published in your paper on the 16th of this month, entitled "Fuan Amusement Park Broadly Advertises: 'Death is Not Compensated,' and Huang Shigong Foolishly Takes the Fall, Bleeding After Being Struck." From my youth to adulthood, I have practiced Chinese martial arts and mastered internal energy cultivation techniques. I previously performed voluntary stage acts at the World Amusement Center disaster relief fundraising event, earning the undeserved title of "Strongman" from the event organizers, a title I find deeply humbling. This time, the Fuan Amusement Park hired the Xiaying Martial Arts Troupe to perform martial arts. Being a friend of the park's director, Wang Rui, I offered to help. Unexpectedly, the Fuan Amusement Park placed large advertisements in various newspapers, changing my name to Wang Zhiqing and inviting the audience to strike my entire body with iron weapons. I was not injured in any way, nor did I bleed. The report in your paper is far from the truth. Upon investigating the advertisements placed by the park, I found them to be outrageous. No one in the world is truly invincible. No expert in Chinese martial arts would dare to make such a boastful and deceptive statement. The park's act of substituting names is unacceptable. If I were to be beaten to death, would I not be giving my life away for nothing? Neither I nor the martial arts troupe have signed any life-or-death contracts with the park. The park's purpose in placing this advertisement is solely to attract an audience and generate revenue at the expense of others' lives. The night before last, I invited my brothers and others to question the park's manager and request to see the life-or-death contract, but we found nothing. This led to a dispute, and we went to the police station together. After the patrol officer clarified the facts, we were released as there was no wrongdoing on our part. There was no matter of a settlement or Bao Qinxuan, the manager of Fuan, posting bail for our release. This matter concerns my lifelong reputation, so I am writing to request a correction, urging your esteemed newspaper to publish it to clarify the facts and correct public perception. I am deeply grateful. Respectfully, I wish you well in your writing endeavors.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Huang Shigong</p>

<h3 id="e154">The Shanghai Fish and Seafood Industry (A Survey of Shanghai's Industry and Commerce, No. 18) <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>I. The Position of the Fish and Seafood Industry in Shanghai. The Qiafeng Faji Fish Shop (Note) and Hengyuan Shenji Fish Shop both closed down last spring.</p>
<p>According to general estimates, Shanghai's annual fish and seafood trade (part of which is salted fish and seafood) exceeded 60 million yuan during its peak. In recent years, with the decline of the market, it still amounts to a huge sum of 15 to 16 million yuan. The importance of Shanghai's fish market is evident from this. The reasons for this can be attributed to two factors: first, Shanghai has a population of over 3.4 million, creating a huge demand; second, it is located on the coast near the river estuary, serving as a hub for the distribution of fish and seafood. Cultured fish from counties like Wuxing, Kunshan, and Wujiang, river fish from various counties along the river, fresh chilled fish and dried salted fish from coastal areas in Zhejiang (such as Yin County, Dinghai County, etc.) and coastal areas in Shandong (such as Qingdao, Weihaiwei, etc.) all rely on Shanghai as their final distribution point. Furthermore, the fish and seafood caught by local fishing vessels are sold entirely in the local market. Therefore, it is no accident that Shanghai has become the only major fish market in the country.</p>
<p>II. Shanghai's Fish Shops and Fishing Vessels</p>
<p>Companies. Shanghai, as a hub for the distribution of fish and seafood, has specialized merchants who act as agents for buying and selling, taking a commission. Due to historical and geographical reasons, these businesses are concentrated in the Xiaodongmen area of the 16th Wharf, including over ten ice-fresh fish shops, five or six freshwater fish shops, and some that operate both. In addition, there are over thirty salted fish shops and over fifty seafood shops (including those that operate both). The ice-fresh fish shops have the highest annual turnover, followed by the freshwater fish shops.</p>
<p>In recent years, the social and economic situation has been poor, and all industries have been affected, including the fish shops, which are no exception. Last year, the Qiafeng Faji Fish Shop (Note 1) and Hengyuan Shenji Fish Shop closed down last spring. The Gongda Fish Shop (Note 2) and Yuantong Xingji Fish Shop also announced liquidation in July of the same year. All of this proves the difficulties of running an ice-fresh fish business. However, overall, the industry is still able to maintain a reasonable profit.</p>
<p>Note 1: After Qiafeng Faji closed down in the spring, they worked hard to resume operations, which was realized in December of the same year. The original partnership was changed to a limited company, renamed Hengji, with a capital of 30,000 yuan divided into 300 shares of 100 yuan each. One-third of the capital was collected, and Zhang Shungen (formerly Lu Jintang) was appointed as manager, and Zhang Xiaochu as supervisor.</p>
<p>Note 2: Gongda also resumed operations in the same month, renamed Gongda Zhongji, with a capital of 18,000 yuan divided into 12 shares. The shareholders were Jiang Ashun, Zhou Yongzhao, and Shi Arong, etc., and Shi Arong was appointed as manager.</p>
<p>As for the salted fish shops in the Xiaodongmen area of the 16th Wharf, although their turnover decreased by 20-30% compared to previous years, they all made a profit due to prudent operations and avoiding bad debts. This is also noted below for reference.</p>
<p>In addition to the fish shops selling fish and seafood, there are also fishing vessel companies engaged in fishing. Shanghai's fishing vessel industry has a history of over thirty years, including both hand-operated net fishing vessels and trawlers. Their current status is listed below:</p>
<p>Note: From Xinghua to Haili, eight are trawlers, and from Chunxing onwards, seven are hand-operated net fishing vessels. Of the aforementioned fifteen companies, except for Jiying, which is a training vessel solely funded by the Xiamen Jimei Fisheries School, the rest are joint-stock companies. Xinghua was reorganized from the former Zhonghua Fisheries Company.</p>
<p>From the above table, we can derive two concepts: first, Shanghai's existing fishing vessel industry is all newly established in recent years; second, the capital and tonnage of the fishing vessels are extremely small. This shows that the economic conditions are a factor contributing to Japanese fishing vessels being able to intrude and fish in China's coastal waters, in addition to general political relations. This is something we should not ignore.</p>

<p>Frog King Guo Zhenheng's Training of the Women's Class is Very Successful</p>
<p>Liang Weisheng Leaves Shanghai, and There Is One Less Long-Distance Swimmer</p>
<p>As spring returns and the football and basketball season comes to an end, track and field and swimming are about to begin. The recent activities of Shanghai's swimming athletes are of concern to all sectors of society. Here is a summary:</p>
<p>Guo Zhenheng - Guo Zhenheng, the Frog King who was selected to attend this year's World Games, enrolled in Fudan University in Jiangwan after representing Guangdong at the 6th National Games last winter. Guo has many old friends in Shanghai, such as the three Jian brothers, who have been close friends since childhood. Last winter, they joined the Zhongqing Warm Water Swimming Pool together and organized a women's class. The training results have been very good, and Guo has also been diligently practicing. His technique is constantly improving. It will not be difficult for him to demonstrate his power in this year's city open competition. With the efforts of Jian Erzhi, the talent in frog swimming in Shanghai will be further enhanced.</p>
<p>Liang Weisheng - At the 6th National Games, the Shanghai men's swimming team ranked fourth with twelve points. This was mainly due to the support of Shi Xungen and Liang Weisheng. Shi is still studying at Aurora University in Fan Huangdu, while Liang graduated from the Taxation College last year and is working at the Shanghai Customs. In November of last winter, he was ordered to be transferred and is now working at the Guangzhou Customs. The development of swimming in Shanghai is lagging behind, and there are very few short-distance swimmers. Besides Liang Weisheng, only Huang Rixiong can be considered. Now that Liang has gone to Guangdong, the short-distance strength will be even weaker. Weisheng and Yang Xiuzhen have been engaged for a long time and are said to be getting married soon.</p>
<p>Chen Wenhe - Chen Wenhe, who studies at Datong University, showed some promise last summer and performed well. In winter, he joined the Zhongqing Warm Water Swimming Pool and worked hard. After months of training, he has made rapid progress. He is expected to put on an amazing performance in this year's swimming season and will compete with Shi in the long distance. There will be another new talent in long-distance swimming.</p>

<p>The Youyou Athletic Association has made tireless efforts to promote sports and has achieved remarkable results. The football and basketball teams it has organized have excellent skills. The Youyou Cup basketball tournament, which the association has held for many years, could not be held this year due to time constraints and other reasons. However, the association has recently received numerous requests from outside basketball teams for friendly matches. Therefore, in order to promote communication between all parties, it plans to hold ten friendly matches. It recently held a friendly match with the Tianxing team, which the Youyou team won. If any Shanghai teams wish to have a friendly match with the association, please send a letter to the basketball team at 306 Maitehesituo Road to arrange the date and time. You will then be notified of the match.</p>

<p>The Netherlands Has Strong Strength and Ambitious Aspirations to Win the Championship</p>
<p>Assuming that the 10th World Games, to be held in Berlin this August, is not affected by the abolition of Germany, the Netherlands has a good chance of winning the football championship. Uruguay is the current Olympic football champion, having won the final against Argentina in 1928 in the Dutch capital. There was no football program at the 10th World Games held in Los Angeles, USA in 1932. The Dutch football team is very strong and has a record of ten victories against European countries, although they have not played against South American teams. In 1931, they defeated Denmark in Copenhagen 2-0. In 1931, they defeated France in Paris 4-3. In 1932, they defeated Belgium in Brussels 3-2. In 1932, they defeated Germany in Dusseldorf 2-0. In 1933, they defeated Belgium in Antwerp 3-1. In 1934, they defeated Belgium in Antwerp 4-2. In 1934, they defeated Switzerland in Bern 4-2. In 1935, they defeated Belgium in Brussels 2-0. In 1935, they defeated Ireland in Dublin 5-3. In 1936, they defeated France in Paris 6-0. The Dutch football team is composed of diverse members, but they all participate as amateurs. They include a police officer, a hotel waiter, a milkman, a chauffeur, two junior clerks, and two students. They only have the opportunity to practice in their spare time. Although they lost to England last year, the defeat was glorious. England played with ten professional players and one amateur player and only narrowly won 2-1. The Dutch team's trainer is the Englishman Glenn Denning. Their tactics have become Anglicized, as has their orange velvet jersey. Their attacking style is to make good use of the wings, and they are also very skilled at heading the ball.</p>

All public and registered private specialized schools and above must comply with the above regulations and report by a specific date. The Ministry will not review the qualifications of graduates, nor will it stamp their graduation certificates. All are instructed to comply.</p>

<p>Datong University: Datong University has been engaged in production and business since the year before last, starting with fish farming and tree planting as pilot projects. The school site is surrounded by streams for several miles, with clear and fertile water. Last spring, more than 300,000 fish fry were raised, and within a year, each grew to over a foot long. Last year, the Zhejiang Agricultural Experiment Station purchased many of them. Moreover, the school covers an area of more than 300 acres, and there is a lot of open space besides the buildings, so it is very suitable for planting tree seedlings. The current plantings include poplar, peach, willow, plum, osmanthus, paulownia, fir, and other trees, totaling no less than 100,000 plants. Due to proper cultivation, they are growing very rapidly. This month, the Shanghai Municipal Council purchased a large batch of poplars and willows from the school for use as roadside shade trees. It is heard that the school is also planning to decide on other production and business ventures, and the prospects are limitless.</p>

<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>The finale of one night's enjoyment was the Grand March of all the young people, starting with the pumpkin carriage, with Cinderella and the coachman transformed sitting in it, and the four great mice running and jumping in front.</p>
<p>As the children enjoyed this last prank, the adults sat in the living room watching, discussing the little ones with the interest of parents and friends.</p>
<p>"What are you thinking about there by yourself, with such a happy look on your face, Miss Shu?" Laurie asked, as he sat down next to her on a sofa.</p>
<p>She made room for him and replied with a smile, "Teddy, I was working on my summer plans and imagining the future of my boys, and I found it quite interesting."</p>
<p>"They will all become poets, painters, politicians, famous military strategists, or at least business leaders, I presume."</p>
<p>"No, I don't have as much hope as I used to. I would be content if they were honest people. But I must admit that I do harbor some hopes for the honor and greater future of a few of them.

<h3 id="e183">Grain: Flour and Wheat Surge and Plummet <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The flour market initially surged, but plummeted sharply in the afternoon. At the opening in the morning, although the quoted price of foreign wheat was still slightly lower by one cent, off-market participants were keen on speculation and actively buying, so the market atmosphere was also volatile. The highest for this month jumped to 3.322 yuan, for April to 3.3441 yuan, for June to 3.1195 yuan, for July to 3.115 yuan, and for August to 3.117 yuan, which were higher by three, four and five cents compared to the previous day. After three rounds, as the buyers slightly cleared out, it fell back by two or three cents. By the opening in the afternoon, after two rounds, the market remained tight due to the large buyers from outside the market. Afterwards, as the buying sentiment receded, although the factories continued to hedge, the momentum was hit. Each month fell by three, five and six cents compared to the highest in the morning. Looking at the current market atmosphere, it has entered such a high level. If the domestic new wheat harvest is good, it is necessary to guard against the reaction. However, the exchange's margin has been increased by one time to 500 yuan.</p>

<p>At the opening of the wheat market, due to the alarming rise in prices in recent days, off-market buyers were universally excited. Therefore, after the opening, due to the activity of the buyers, the market improved step by step. Each month rose by five or six cents compared to the previous day. By the opening in the afternoon, it was initially calm. Afterwards, due to the return of bulls and the sharp reversal in the flour market, the market sentiment was very weak, and they were selling off. Compared to the highest price in the morning, it fell by a huge one cent. Compared to the previous day's closing price, it also fell by three to five cents. This kind of rise and fall is purely the result of market sentiment and has nothing to do with the facts. Currently, the high-quality wheat is being bid up by three to five cents. The medium-quality wheat remains the same. Kaihaizhou Shandong Yaowan wheat is 5.3 yuan, Hankou Che wheat is 5.25 yuan and 5.1125 yuan. The sub-quality wheat is 4.97 yuan. Fuxin bought 3,600 bags, and Shenda and Nafeng each bought 1,000 bags.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 30 ships arrived from various sources (nearly 7,000 shi of goods). The sales in this street are still sluggish, and the consumption is also not good, so the market conditions turned soft. The price of thick early japonica rice fell by five cents to one jiao. The price of thin indica rice is barely holding steady for the high-quality rice, and the medium-quality rice also continues to fall by nearly one jiao. According to statistics, Tianjin and Qingdao merchants bought more than 1,000 bags of thick japonica rice and more than 2,000 bags of thin indica rice. Duyangjian rice has no formal market, and sales are sluggish and falling by two or three jiao. The price of Yuan rice is fluctuating.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 18 or 19 ships arrived from various sources downriver. The market transactions are quiet. The price of white japonica rice is slightly lower by one jiao, and the price of early rice is slightly lower by nearly one jiao. The price of thin indica rice is slightly lower by seven or eight cents, and the price of Yinbian Yuan rice is slightly lower by six or seven cents. The sales of Yang Dufu Xian rice are weak, and the price is flat.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Indica Rice Sales Turn Sluggish <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Indica rice market continued to see arrivals from various ports, but the interior has long stopped buying, and the local consumption is also sluggish. Stockholders are even selling off, and the market conditions are quite weak and lifeless. However, Quanzhou merchants bought more than 300 bags of brown rice in small quantities, and Tianjin merchants also inquired about foreign rice, so Siamese rice bucked the trend and rose by four or five cents, with 500 bags sold. Although Indica rice did not fall, it still fell by about one jiao. A total of 1,000 bags of Gan rice, 62 bags of Anqing rice, 134 bags of Beijing brown rice, 400 bags of Hankou brown rice, and 200 bags of Taiwan indica rice were sold throughout the day. The market is still stable.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Oil Cakes Rebound and Fall – Slight Impact on Spot Market <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The standard soybean cake markets fell sharply yesterday morning after the opening as various firms and merchants sold off along with factory hedging. All months saw flat prices, although Dalian telegrams had reported slight declines in both the cake and bean markets, the oil price briefly rose, which briefly turned the oil market in the morning. But in the afternoon, rumors were rampant, Dalian's telegrams returned lower, and the flour and wheat markets all shifted in unison, with continuous sales by factories and merchants and profit-taking by off-market bulls, resulting in a unanimous decline due to excessive gains in recent days and an immediate reaction to unexpected news. At closing, standard oil fell by three to four jiao, standard beans by one jiao, standard cakes by two to three cents, and foreign sesame by slightly more than two jiao.</p>
<p>The current spot soybean cake market has not been affected by the sharp decline in standard soybean cakes. The bean market was not good, but sales were inevitably reduced. The spot soybean market opened unchanged. Soybean oil transactions totaled 200 pieces of factory oil, delivered in ten days; 50 pieces of Dashu oil, delivered in fourteen days; 50 pieces, delivered in ten days; and 50 pieces of Dalian Qishan oil. Soybean transactions saw 100 bags of Luohe beans, 1,400 bags of Doudou Sha Huang, and 400 bags of Hankou Late Beans. The opening was made for one truckload of Sipingjie beans to be delivered frozen, and another truckload to be delivered two weeks after defrosting.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Yarn and Cotton: Standard Yarn Rises to Fill Gaps <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The May contract rose to 210 yuan outside the customs.</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending firm, and the rising trend is rising again because Huaibei Tianjin merchants are eagerly buying 10-count and 17-count coarse yarn, and the market price is soaring, people are shaken, and those floating in the air, in view of the good environment, are scrambling to make up for their positions. This month, a certain bank received goods for arbitrage, and the situation became even more vigorous. The May contract rose to 210 yuan outside the customs.</p>
<p>Standard yarn rises sharply across all months. At the opening of the standard yarn market, the現紗sales price soared due to the massive buying of coarse yarn by Tianjin merchants on the previous day, and people's hearts were shaken. As the delivery period for this month approaches, there is great preparation for receiving goods, and the banking sector is also taking advantage of arbitrage. Therefore, the market in the near month is exceptionally tight, and the buying sentiment is strong. All months are rising in unison. As a result, each month rose by 1.5 yuan to 2.5-6 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. At the opening in the afternoon, the trend in the near month was quite strong, but the far month was flat. However, Xincheng bought in bulk to make up for positions. After two rounds, each month fell back by eight or nine jiao due to the step-by-step decline in Osaka Sanpin yarn, and morale was affected. However, Xincheng alone bought 7,750 bags. As a result, there was no movement in the current month, and the price fell by 3.7 jiao to 1.1 jiao in the distant month. Dafu sold 1,400 bags, Tongji 950 bags, Yuda 900 bags, Jinchang 1,550 bags, Yicheng 4,000 bags, Taichang 1,850 bags, Yichang 1,850 bags, Changfeng 2,050 bags, Tonghe 1,700 bags, and Yukang 900 bags. Hexing bought 1,150 bags, Gengfeng 850 bags, Senkang 1,300 bags, Dachangcheng 1,300 bags, Xincheng 7,750 bags, Jinkang 550 bags, and Runkang 550 bags. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for one day are listed below:</p>

<p>The comparison of Indian cotton prices is close, and market sentiment is hit.</p>
<p>The cotton market started rising and then falling, and the situation is weaker than the yarn market, because the comparison of Indian cotton prices is gradually approaching, which hits the market sentiment and reduces buying interest. At the same time, Indian cotton factories have slightly定成, and the bulls have lost interest.</p>
<p>Standard cotton Xincheng is拖進 in large quantities. At the opening of the standard cotton market, the prices of American cotton fluctuated, up and down 1-5 points, the prices of Indian cotton rose and fell by 0.5 to 1.5 rupees, and Osaka Sanpin cotton fell by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. The market sentiment was average. However, it was reported that the European political situation was fatherly serious, and the bulls were active. At the end of the second round, the纱市 was strong and rose again. By the end of the third closing, it was rumored that the purchase order of Indian cotton was very strong, and it turned soft again. As a result, the closing prices of each month rose by 1, 2, and 3 jiao compared with the closing prices of the previous day. The opening in the afternoon was still good. After the second round, it turned into a tired state. With the price of Osaka Sanpin cotton falling, market sentiment was sluggish. However, Xincheng and Dafeng dragged in 17,100 dan. As a result, the closing prices of each month fell by jiao compared with the closing prices in the morning.

<p>World Cotton Consumption Increases</p>
<p>US Cotton Fertilizer Usage Decreases</p>
<p>Yesterday's US cotton opening saw each month fluctuate by two to three points. Peers were waiting for developments in the European situation and Washington's attitude towards cotton. The March contract rose due to peers and short sellers buying, and cotton囤棉 had not yet been sold off, so it rose. The remaining months saw foreign merchants sell off hedging, bulls closing positions, and a lack of buying interest, so it was tired. At closing, peers were covering short positions, which was relatively stable. It is estimated that spot prices rose by five points, and futures fell by one point to rising five points. The Cotton Exchange estimates that world cotton consumption is approximately 27,000,000 bales, the largest amount in any previous year was 25,778,000 bales. The New Orleans Exchange estimates that in the seven months ending at the end of February, a total of 927,000 tons of fertilizer were used in ten provinces, compared to 990,000 tons last year. British spot cotton was unchanged, and futures fell by two or three points. Indian cotton initially rose due to purchases by Japanese merchants and spot merchants, but later declined due to upper India selling and bulls closing positions. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by 1 to 1.25 rupees, Aomula fell by 0.5 to 0.75 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 16th).</p>

<p>Final maneuvering around fifty yuan, market conditions were slow, resulting in a slight drop of one cent.</p>
<p>Although the gold market's major transactions shrank yesterday, large holders still sold at the high, causing the upward trend to ultimately lack sustained momentum. The balanced tax was slightly lower by one cent, moving lower after rising. However, it ultimately became slow with little change.

The HSBC listed price was revealed, with England and America both flat, and some maneuvering continued. Later, the silver balanced tax was revealed to have fallen by one cent, causing weakness for a time. Before long, transactions became even scarcer, and market conditions were stagnant. Therefore, there was considerable support at the low, gradually pulling up. The overall trend was stable at noon, and the overall trend was even flatter in the afternoon, always maneuvering around 50 yuan. Although it slightly rose after opening, it was difficult to sustain due to slight restrictions from banks. However, the Indian silver report fell by one anna, and there was also much support after the low, resulting in a lack of change in market conditions. The same was true at the end. Spot price trading of May futures was offered by the long side at 7.1 yuan, with May swaps quoted at 4.5 yuan. This record of today's market conditions follows:</p>

<p>The exchange market's process was slightly erratic yesterday. Indian silver prices contracted, resulting in a slight tightening. Early in the morning, foreign telegrams showed London's near-term major transactions shrinking by 0.1875 and forward shrinking by 0.125. It was said that after the close, there were a few local sellers at the listed price, but local Indians also bought in. The New York silver market remained unchanged.

After opening, banks actively traded with each other. The HSBC listed price was revealed, with England and America both flat and maneuvering. The silver balanced tax was revealed to have fallen by one cent, slightly loosening. However, because banks were still buying at low prices and there were interbank transactions, the process gradually became stable. Banks still had acceptance, and it remained flat at noon. In the afternoon market, banks traded with each other and swapped futures, causing the situation to become even flatter. The Indian silver report showed a small decrease of seven annas, and Chinese merchants slightly bought. Finally, it tightened, extending to the close.

<p>Most Results are Slightly Down by 0.01 or 0.02 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the market still did not see much activity, and the market atmosphere became increasingly weak. The path for entry and exit on the table became narrower. Observing that a few tens of thousands bought in, the price was raised by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan. A few tens of thousands sold out, and the price was reduced by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan. It can be seen that most people have no intention of participating in this. Since the government's control, going short means guarding against being raised, and going long is not permitted by the environment. Those with slightly larger appetite are avoiding this and going to other exchanges. The securities market is becoming increasingly stagnant. Yesterday, the 16th type A slightly sold out, and the 48th type E slightly bought in. Therefore, these two types had slightly more advances and retreats. The rest remained as stagnant as before. Only the opening round of type D had some trading. The other three rounds had no transactions at all. The degree of stagnation can be imagined. The process yesterday was that only the opening round in the morning had relatively more transactions. The 16th sold over 100,000 of type A, and the 47th was also slowly emerging. The market price was down by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan. The type D final settlement failed to open, and the transactions further decreased. The market situation continued to decrease by about 0.01 yuan. The afternoon opening saw the 48th slightly buy type E, raising it by 0.25 yuan. The rest saw highs and lows, with a situation of not being able to raise high and not being able to decrease. The closing transactions became more and more clear. Only type C had more entry and exit. The market price was still seeing highs and lows. Most results continued to decrease by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan. Only type C was slightly better by 0.01 yuan, because the market price of type C and type E had almost increased relative to each other, and type C was relatively cheaper. The total number of transactions was still only 1,785,000 yuan, which was only a slight increase of 230,000 transactions compared to the previous day. The comparison of the results of the rises and falls is listed on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan):</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that yesterday (16th) New York stock market transactions were quite stagnant. Prices initially declined, then rebounded under the leadership of public utilities. The results were mixed. The Steel Society announced that the steel mill operating rate is now 60%, up 4.2% from last week. Steel and silver stocks had no trend. Airline stocks were firm. Auto stocks were stagnant and slightly soft. In the small exchanges, public utilities also rose, while the rest were semi-quiet. The bond market was stagnant and firm.

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat. The guild's marked prices, such as 24 coarse white and Dongchi white, as well as the factory's refined white, were all quoted at the original price with no increase or decrease. Domestic Five Sheep coarse white was 22.05 yuan, with slightly more being marked out, 0.05 yuan less than the listed price. The factory's ice number 1 was 25 yuan, and number 2 was 24.9 jiao. The number plates were also very weak. Chaoqing, such as Tizhuang, was quoted at 10.8 yuan, Huanggangqing at 10.4 yuan, and Longgangqing at 9.2 yuan, with little acceptance. The price offered by the firms for Diaoqing was too short, and there was not much appetite, so no transactions were made. It was heard that some firm's goods had been transferred to Ningbo for sale. The market outlook is temporarily difficult to be optimistic about.</p>

<p>Recently, miscellaneous road longan arrivals have been sporadic. Checking the market, the firms have little stock, but because sales are currently quiet, the firms are only selling and not buying. The selling price of sifted village goods is 0.01 or 0.02 yuan lower than before, so the firm's price is limited too high by the cargo owner, and it is impossible to form a transaction. Unless there is a large amount of consumption, it will be difficult to rebound. It was also heard that the price of Xinghua products is also slightly lower.</p>

<p>After the fennel price rose to 30 yuan, it remained unchanged for nearly a month, failing to continue to rise. Although arrivals have been low recently, sales have been quiet. Firms with relatively thick stocks cannot avoid the intention to sell quickly. Therefore, the selling price is declining, 0.01 or 0.02 yuan lower than before.

<p>Since the price of thin tinplate increased, the source has been scarce. Recently, because cigarette factories and biscuit companies have been buying, stocks have become shallower and prices have soared. Each box is opening at 65 yuan.</p>
<p>Since enamel thermos factories have been buying black iron sheets, transactions have been quite prosperous. Yesterday's transactions reached over 2,000 bundles. However, the supply of goods circulating in the market suddenly decreased, so market conditions are very good. Each bundle is opening at 9 yuan, which is 0.25 yuan better than before. It is heard that the cost of subsequent arrivals will be around 9.7 or 9.8 yuan, so the market conditions have the potential to rise again.</p>

<p>The human heart is like the brilliance of the bright moon, eternally bright and pure; it is also like a pool of clear water, endlessly deep.</p>
<p>However, the human heart cannot be eternally bright and pure like the moonlight. It is like a pure white silver ingot, which turns into dark silver nitrate when it encounters nitric acid. Yet it will not become a valuable piece of black gold. It is also like a stone dropped into a pool of clear, bottomless water, "bang!" Splashes of water scatter everywhere, stirring up the silt at the bottom of the lake, immediately turning clarity into turbidity.</p>
<p>When a dark cloud comes, it obscures the brilliance of the bright moon, and the heavens and earth immediately turn dim. Therefore, when a person takes their bright heart and throws themselves into the world, brightness and purity will turn into turbidity. To go further, the world will easily form darkness!</p>
<h3 id="e204">The Ancestral Graves of the Feng and Shang Families <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Bright Moon</p>
<p>The art of geomancy has been passed down for a long time. People who are good at geomancy are generally called "geographers" or "feng shui masters." However, the relationship between geography, feng shui, and the fortunes of the living and the dead seems to be shrouded in incredible mystery.</p>
<p>It is said that Shang Qiyu (Zhen), one of the three chairmen from Shaoxing, has an ancestral grave in the Zhejiang Yidi in Baoding. This grave has been buried for decades and has not been repaired at all. Yet it still looks like a newly buried grave, with the soil color unchanged. In the spring and summer, it appears especially verdant and lovely. However, there are many graves in that Yidi, all connected to each other, but those that have fallen have fallen, and those that have collapsed have collapsed. None can remain unchanged for decades like the Shang family's ancestral grave. Therefore, a feng shui master said that this grave is located at the end of the earth's pulse, accumulating spiritual energy, and the future is promising. If this is the case, is the principle of feng shui really worth believing?</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang also has an ancestral grave in Baoding. When it was exhumed and reburied in the south a few years ago, hot air steamed up from the soil, and wisteria vines were wrapped around the coffin, which was as new. When the vines were cut, white sap flowed out. According to those who know feng shui, this is a place with good feng shui, but it was ruined by Feng. It should be known that Feng Yuxiang has never liked superstition. After his ancestral grave was relocated, he did not encounter any disasters, and he is still an important figure in the party and the country. Then, so-called feng shui seems unbelievable.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Shop Number Five <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Recently, our company transferred an accounting department director from the Hankou branch. Everyone secretly calls him "Shop Number Five." I found this very strange, and after inquiring, I learned that this so-called "Shop Number Five" has quite a history.</p>
<p>It happened seven years ago, when he was working as a shop assistant in a certain foreign firm. At that time, he was already in his thirties, earning only about twenty yuan a month. His family's life was naturally very difficult, so he pawned his sister in the red-light district. Coincidentally, the compradore in that foreign firm frequented prostitutes and fell in love at first sight, spending every evening there. At first, he did not know that his beloved was the shop assistant's sister from shop number five. After mingling for a while, the two even swore a blood oath, and the compradore paid to get her out of prostitution and made her a concubine, enjoying her exclusive favor. The shop assistant feared that his position would affect his sister's favor, so the siblings agreed to keep the secret from the compradore. But from then on, the shop assistant's family finances naturally improved.</p>
<p>After two months or so, something was bound to happen one day. The shop assistant went to his sister's house and met the compradore there. After questioning, the siblings could not hide it and had to confess everything. Unexpectedly, two days later, the shop assistant was promoted to "clerk." At the same time, the compradore ordered him to attend night school. Two years later, because of his hard work and study, his academics greatly improved. At the same time, because of his humble origins, he was despised by his colleagues and had a strong desire to leave. So the compradore recommended him to the company I now work for as an accountant. The compradore was a director of this company, and the compradore's son was also the associate manager, so he had a lot of influence.</p>
<p>A year later, the compradore's son took a fancy to his fifteen-year-old daughter, and he cleverly sent his daughter to him as an outside concubine. Then, he was dispatched to the Hankou branch as the accounting director. It was not until last autumn that he was transferred back to the head office as the accounting director, with a monthly salary of 250 yuan.</p>
<p>This accounting director is quite clever and capable, and he is also very loyal to his duties, so everyone does not have much ill feeling towards him. However, people who are familiar with his history always like to use the words "Shop Number Five" in private to represent his distinguished name.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Dog's Grave <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— He Jiale</p>
<p>One or two months ago, a dog school was discovered in Shanghai, causing a sensation, because in China, dog protection has never received much attention. In Herrstel, USA, there have long been special facilities for dogs, including the construction of a magnificent cemetery in 1896, like a regular human cemetery. When a beloved dog of a certain family dies, they must buy a coffin. It is said that the most exquisite coffin costs 200 pounds. The most ordinary one also costs 10 to 20 pounds. After being sent to the cemetery for burial, a tombstone must be erected, stating the dog's name and the year of burial. Some even have "epitaphs" engraved on them.</p>
<p>In this Herrstel dog cemetery, there is a dog that died on the front lines during the European War, so a bronze statue was specially made and erected in the sky, looking down on everything. The words "War Dog Sacrificed for the Country" are engraved on the tombstone below. On every anniversary of its death, many people bring wreaths to pay tribute.</p>
<p>Some people say, "Better to be a dog in a peaceful time than a person in a chaotic world!" Their words show some envy for the animals in the land of gold.</p>

<p>Mr. Cheng was a little shorter and had no beard, but his yellow-black face and bald head were full of energy. Guo Zhuoran held Zhiqian's hand first and said, "County Chief Zhou said that Mr. Cheng is willing to join our group, and we are very welcome. We have decided to extend the trip by half a year." Zhiqian smiled and said, "I don't deserve that. My original plan to travel west only to Lanzhou was regrettable. I heard that to truly see the situation in the West, one must go beyond the Yumen Pass. So, I lingered in Xi'an, neither advancing nor retreating, just waiting for such an opportunity. Now that you two are organizing a tour group to the West, it perfectly suits my wishes." Guo Zhuoran waited for him to finish speaking before letting go of his hand. He sat to the side and nodded to Zhiqian, smiling, "We were very happy to hear from County Chief Zhou that Mr. Cheng had been to Gansu before. Because people who have not truly felt the joy of traveling cannot go there for the first time. Last time we went to Dihua via the Ningxia route, we only felt that it was just a corner of Xinjiang and could not be considered knowing Xinjiang. This time we are going west again, preparing to go to southern Xinjiang." Zhiqian was very happy, as if he couldn't express the joy in his heart. He just sat to the side, rubbing his hands together. Cheng Shigong smiled and said, "Seeing Mr. Cheng's situation, it is clear that he is one of our comrades. I heard that Mr. Cheng is willing to go to Qinghai, and we will definitely accompany you. I heard that there is also the Labrang tribe in the southwest corner of Gansu, and we also plan to visit them." Zhiqian said, "I met this tribe in Lanzhou. They wear purple cloth leather robes with sleeves that are more than three feet long, and the robes are only three feet long. They wear pointed hats, which look somewhat like the soap operas on the stage. A pair of high-waisted boots reach the knees. But they are very strong and can ride horses and shoot guns." Cheng Shigong smiled and said, "Speaking of the appearance of the people, Xinjiang is the most meaningful. When we see the Hui people, we mistakenly think they are Indians. When we see the southern Xinjiang Hui people, we mistakenly think they are Turks. In fact, they are our compatriots. As long as a person does not let down these two legs, there is a treasure trove of knowledge everywhere in the universe. We are only afraid that we ourselves are unwilling to go and find it." Zhiqian clapped his legs and laughed, "Don't say anything else, I dare not be arrogant, but speaking of these two legs, they are quite strong." (417)</p>

<p>— Huang Kewei</p>
<p>Like fallen leaves in autumn, on the turbid currents of the Whangpoo River, huge warships and merchant vessels move up and down, piece by piece, quietly drifting.</p>
<p>Every day, from morning to night, braving the misty haze, accompanied by the loud steam whistles, gently rocking their creaky wooden awnings, carrying boats full of people, from Pudong to Puxi, from Puxi to Pudong, tirelessly shuttling back and forth to earn a meager fare.</p>
<p>They live on the water; the Whangpoo River is so familiar and dear to them!</p>
<p>Perhaps driven by curiosity, one day, on the way back from a friend's house, I deliberately took a small sampan to Puxi for a fresh and slightly thrilling experience.</p>
<p>It was early spring afternoon, and the bright sun painted a layer of gold on the river water. Tiny waves shimmered brilliantly, and droplets splashed on the oars like many tiny, transparent pearls.</p>
<p>On this vast river, sitting in such a small ferry, one truly feels so small, while the river surface feels even more expansive! When a steamboat passes by, the boat violently pitches, shaking up and down, giving one's nerves a little jolt of terror.</p>
<p>The boatman was an elderly man in his fifties. Although his face was etched with many wrinkles from the trials of life, making him look very old, he was full of energy, and rowing was very vigorous. During this short several-minute voyage, while admiring the scenery of Puxi, I casually asked him:</p>
<p>"How much money can you make in a day?"</p>
<p>"At most, only a little over a thousand cash; sometimes, I can't even earn a few hundred!"</p>
<p>His tone of voice concealed a long sigh, but he didn't utter it, only expressing his inner distress with a bitter smile!</p>
<p>A small steamer belonging to the Taikoo Dockyard &amp; Engineering Company was steaming majestically towards us from the opposite direction, packed with people. He suddenly said softly: "Ships like these company boats are fast and stable, and they don't cost money, so naturally more people ride them. They've taken a big chunk of our business!"</p>
<p>At this moment, the boat shook violently again. I stared wistfully at the company boats crowded with passengers, deeply feeling that these small ferries are struggling on the turbulent river!</p>

<h3 id="e209">A Record of Visiting Plum Blossoms in the Snow <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Xiafei</p>
<p>Plum blossoms are originally nothing rare in my hometown of Xishan, Dongting Lake, because our houses are almost built in plum groves. As long as you open the door and look up, you see the pure white and lovely plum blossoms; sometimes, plum groves stretch continuously for one or two miles, and as we walk along the paths under the trees, we can't even see a patch of sky. But this year when I returned home, although it was the season for viewing plum blossoms, because of the cold weather, the plum blossoms everywhere were still only budding, and wouldn't seem likely to bloom for another ten days or half a month.</p>
<p>A week later, the weather suddenly turned much colder, so cold that it felt almost like the depths of winter; and from the evening, goose feather-like snowflakes began to fall from the sky, without stopping for the entire night. When I opened the door the first morning and looked out, I saw that the roofs, trees, and ground were all covered with a thick layer of white snow. Opening my eyes, I felt as if I were in a world of powdered makeup and jade construction. Even the Four Dragon Mountain, Chicken Cage Mountain in front, the Linwu Mountain below, the Eight Cannon Ridge above, and the Mao Gong Wu behind were all draped in white robes.</p>
<p>In such a magnificent and beautiful scene, the nearby plum blossoms were still sound asleep, so I had to abandon the close and seek the distant, and go to Baoshan to visit plum blossoms in the snow. Because the location there faces the sun, the plum blossoms on Chaoyang Mountain usually bloom a month earlier.</p>
<p>Xiong and I set off. In the afternoon, with a faint sunlight shining on the earth, we walked onto Changshan Road, following the traces of the monks' straw sandals, passed through the Hongshan Gate, crossed Beiyin Mountain, and arrived at the Chaoyang Stream.</p>
<p>As I walked among the plum trees, I accidentally touched a branch, and snowflakes and plum petals fell rustling onto my hair and clothes; but I couldn't bear to brush away these accumulated snow and plum petals, wanting them to stay on my hairline and on my sleeves forever.</p>
<p>Walking on the snow in leather shoes was very easy to slip. Xiong slipped and fell on the hillside while stepping over a large stone. Because I had learned from his mistake, I walked particularly carefully, always grabbing onto the small tree trunks with each step.</p>
<p>In Chaoyang Gully, the streams flowed gurgling, the water was clear and lovely, and the small round stones at the bottom of the gully were all clearly visible. The verdant pine forest on the hillside sent forth the majestic sound of the pine waves, and the fragrance of some wildflowers in the mountains, although buried under the snow, still drifted in bursts.</p>
<p>Xiong leaned against an old plum tree and said to me, "It's a pity we didn't bring a camera. Otherwise, we could have taken some pictures of the snow scene and plum blossoms to take back as a memento!"</p>
<p>At that time, I was walking around the plum grove, gazing at the silver-white plum blossoms, and my heart felt incredibly carefree, as if cleansed of all dust. Although it was the chill of early spring, with the northwest wind sweeping across, I finally climbed up that not-very-high foothill, overlooking the plum blossoms in all directions; I found a plum tree with a unique trunk and horizontal branches, and sat down on a rock, silently gazing up at the treetop. Infinite melancholy and emotion welled up! Thinking that for the sake of life, I had been wandering for half my life, falling into obscurity for a decade, but every time I returned, the mountains and rivers were still the same, while people had changed repeatedly, and the old friends and companions of the past were no longer to be found. Only this plum grove could allow me to reminisce about the remnants of my childhood; but youth had passed, and my state of mind was no longer the same. It was only making future generations feel sentimental!</p>
<p>"Separated from the mortal world by three thousand miles, this heavenly fairy-like beauty, this noble and unsullied character, how lovely it is!" Just as I was lost in thought, I was awakened by a few lines of poetic praise from Xiong.</p>

<p>— Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>Everyone knows that opium contains potent toxins. Some who are weak and frail seek relief by smoking opium, becoming addicted and poisoned. This is quite common. Once the addiction is deep, weakness worsens, making it even more difficult to quit.</p>
<p>Indeed, using the wrong medicine is like scratching an itch through a boot. But when the medicine is right, it's like an echo to a sound.</p>
<p>Last autumn, Mr. Zhu Huaqing came to me complaining of symptoms such as ringing in the ears and a sore back, seeking help to quit his smoking habit. I instructed him to purchase "Shengzhisu" from Zhengwei Pharmacy. He immediately felt his ears clear and his back strengthen. He got rid of the poison and quit smoking, regaining his health and escaping the sea of suffering. In just four weeks, he was cured.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Use Different Medications for Sore Back and Bone Pain <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Bofu</p>
<p>Those who are physically weak or suffer from wind-dampness toxicity often experience back pain and joint aches. The medication used should be different for each. Those with weakness and deficiency should focus on tonifying and strengthening agents, while those with wind-dampness toxicity should focus on expelling toxins and dampness. When both approaches are used, the pain will be quickly relieved, and strength will be restored.</p>
<p>A patient, Feng Songshan, came for a consultation last autumn, complaining of back pain. He had repeatedly taken tonics without full effect. After examining Mr. Feng, I found that he still had residual toxins, which had penetrated into his bones. I instructed him to purchase "Shengzhisu" from Huamei Pharmacy to strengthen his back and "Jiangsidengshi Bone Pain Pills" to expel residual toxins and dispel wind-dampness. After taking them, the effects were remarkable. He confidently continued to take several boxes, and in four or five weeks, his back became strong and his whole body felt light and healthy. He gratefully thanked me and left.</p>

<p>— Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Abdominal pain in women originates from the uterus, either due to cold causing pain or uterine inflammation. Therefore, treatment must involve medicine that directly reaches the uterus to be effective. Female reproductive gland preparations are the only effective remedy for regulating menstruation, treating leukorrhea, warming the uterus, reducing inflammation, ensuring safe pregnancy and childbirth, rejuvenating and restoring youth. Therefore, it is a blessing for all kinds of gynecological diseases. However, if leukorrhea is persistent and untreated, a special remedy for leukorrhea should also be used externally at the same time, so that internal and external remedies can be used in combination to achieve rapid treatment.</p>
<p>Last summer, Mrs. Lin Hongfang, introduced by Mrs. Bao Chengbo, whom I had previously cured, came for a consultation. She complained of symptoms such as abdominal pain during menstruation and persistent leukorrhea. I instructed her to purchase "Female Shengzhisu" for internal use and "Liao Dailing" for external use from Taihe Pharmacy. In about thirty days, she achieved the same satisfactory results as Mrs. Bao. Not only was her menstruation regulated and her leukorrhea cleared, but all her symptoms disappeared, and her breasts became full and shapely, restoring the youthful beauty that a young woman should have. She gratefully thanked me and left.</p>

<p>(A letter from Mr. He Yizhai states:) Because of my weakened and frail body, I suffer from seminal emission. I am mentally confused, have insomnia and many dreams, and experience seminal emission two or three times a week. My essence is depleted, my brain is weak, and my physical strength is unsustainable. As my wedding day approaches, I am even more anxious. Later, I read in this journal that a gentleman suffering from a similar condition to mine was cured by taking "Shengzhisu" and "Ximitushi Sperm-Consolidating Pills" together. I immediately went to the nearby Wuzhou Pharmacy, specifically purchased the above two medications, and took them according to the instructions. After taking them, my seminal gate was consolidated, my seminal emission stopped, my essence was sufficient, my brain was healthy, all my symptoms disappeared, and my health was restored. I began to prepare for my wedding with peace of mind. The self-treatment period did not exceed four weeks.</p>

<p>— Qiao Wenbin</p>
<p>The causes of stomach pain are varied. Ineffective treatment may provide temporary relief, but stomach pain is often considered a difficult and incurable disease, leading to delays in treatment. I treat long-term stomach pain by considering all aspects of the problem and using both treatment and tonification, resulting in radical cures in many cases. The following is one such example.</p>
<p>Mr. Le Qingde, nearly sixty years old, had suffered from stomach pain for almost twenty years. He regarded his stomach medicine as his second life. When the pain attacked, he suffered greatly. Last winter, after seeing that his roommate, Mr. Zhao, who had suffered from stomach pain for seven years, had been radically cured by me, he also came to me for treatment. I instructed him to purchase "Weitongling" and "Jianweisu" from Zhongxi Pharmacy and take them together. In about a month, he achieved complete success. Mr. Le said that he had always thought that stomach pain was a difficult and incurable disease and had given up hope of treatment. He was very grateful for my help in making his later years healthy.</p>

<p>(A letter from Mr. Fang of a certain flour mill in Zhenjiang states:) Because of illness and pain, I became addicted to smoking. The accumulation of tobacco toxins led to frequent weakness and decline. Before reaching the age of forty, I was already like a man in his twilight years. Last year, due to the government's order to quit smoking, I began to seek ways to quit. However, because of the recurrence of illness and pain and my mental depression, I found it difficult to complete the task. Later, I read in this journal that "Shengzhisu" had the effect of treating weakness, removing disease, eliminating toxins, and breaking addiction. I immediately sent a letter to the pharmaceutical department of Shanghai Wing On Company and purchased three boxes. After taking it, I felt refreshed and lost my desire for tobacco. Knowing that it was effective, I confidently continued to take half a dozen boxes. My body became strong, and I developed an aversion to tobacco on my own. To this day, the illness and pain have not reappeared. I have achieved the amazing effect of safely quitting smoking on my own. It is truly a savior for those blacklisted addicts in the midst of the anti-smoking campaign.</p>

<p>(Report by Dr. Wang Shiying) Last autumn, Mr. Hu Guoxuan came to me complaining of symptoms such as seminal emission, many dreams, stomach pain, and back pain. He said that with such a diseased body, there was no need to cling to life, so he often had thoughts of despair. After examining him, I found that Mr. Hu was indeed suffering from a multitude of diseases. I instructed him to purchase "Ximitushi Sperm-Consolidating Pills" and "Shengzhisu" and "Weitongling" and other famous medicines from Zhongfa Pharmacy and take them. After taking them, his essence was consolidated, his seminal emission stopped, his brain was nourished, his sleep was sound, his back was strong and comfortable, his stomach was soothed, and his pain was cured. Moreover, he felt refreshed, his muscles were strong, his mind was broad, and he was infinitely optimistic.</p>

<p>(1) Premature Ejaculation Saved</p>
<p>Patient Wang Haifeng, 29 years old, from Zhenjiang, businessman (chief complaint): Premature ejaculation, sexual weakness, long marriage with no children, physical weakness. (Medical history): Mr. Wang had indulged in sensual pleasures and had frequent relations over the years, leading to the withering of his reproductive system and the symptoms described above. He had been married for nearly ten years without any children, and his vitality was dying out. The husband and wife were in name only. Last summer, he was introduced by a colleague to come for a consultation. (Treatment): After performing the latest scientific surgical electrical therapy, I instructed him to purchase the specific medicine "Shengzhisu" from the pharmacy department of Xinxin Company, taking three tablets three times a day. With the combined effect of electrical therapy and medicine, the effects were remarkable. His body became strong, and his vitality was rekindled. The chronic illness of many years suddenly disappeared, and the couple's relationship was better than it had been during their honeymoon. Mr. Wang was very grateful and has repeatedly introduced many patients with similar conditions for treatment. Last month, when he introduced Mr. Feng for treatment, he said that his wife was already pregnant for several months.</p>
<p>(2) Female Hidden Disease—Safely Quit Smoking</p>
<p>Patient Mrs. Wei Hanzhang, 34 years old, from Beiping, has lived in Shanghai for many years (chief complaint): Leukorrhea. Abdominal pain with cold sensation during menstruation. Smoking cessation stopped. (Medical history): Mrs. Wei had not received proper care after childbirth, and her lochia was not cleansed. She always felt cold and abdominal pain during menstruation due to suffering from leukorrhea. She was physically weak and mentally depressed, leading to her addiction to smoking for seven or eight years. She had repeatedly sought to quit smoking, but it was difficult to succeed. Last year, due to strict prohibitions, she came to me for consultation in late autumn. (Treatment): Since Mrs. Wei's source of illness was in the uterus and could not be reached by ordinary preparations, I instructed her to purchase "Female Shengzhisu" from Tianhua Pharmacy to warm the uterus, relieve pain, regulate menstruation, and treat leukorrhea. I also had her use "Liao Dailing" externally for a combined internal and external effect. Because "Female Shengzhisu" also has the effect of eliminating toxins, breaking addiction, nourishing the body, and benefiting the spirit, it was able to achieve unprecedentedly satisfactory results in about a month, restoring the youthfulness that a young woman should have.</p>

<p>Neurasthenia, Sore Back, and Back Pain</p>
<p>Patient Fu Jinkun, 37 years old, from Ningbo, businessman. (Chief complaint): Sore back and back pain, neurasthenia. (Medical history): Mr. Fu was congenitally deficient, thin and weak, and had suffered from the above symptoms for no less than twelve years. Repeated treatments had been ineffective, and the pain had increased frequently. In recent years, the symptoms of neurasthenia had become more severe, with dizziness, blurred vision, and stabbing pain in the brain. He was in great distress. Last autumn, he was introduced by a close relative to come to me for treatment. (Present symptoms): Stabbing pain in the brain, wind-dampness, and soreness. (Treatment): After examination, I found that Mr. Fu was also suffering from wind-dampness, so his head, brain, back, and spine were all sore and painful. In addition to electrical therapy, I instructed him to purchase "Jiangsidengshi Bone Pain Pills" from Wing On Company to remove his wind-dampness and treat his bone pain, and "Shengzhisu" to relieve his weakness and strengthen his back. After taking five or six boxes consecutively, he immediately felt his back light and healthy, his bones comfortable, and all his ailments were eliminated.</p>
<p>Seminal Emission, Youthful Rebirth in Chongqing</p>
<p>Patient Li Bingyao, 19 years old, from Shantou, student. (Chief complaint): Seminal emission, nocturnal emission, insomnia, forgetfulness. (Medical history): Mr. Li had been poisoned by pornographic books, made the mistake of masturbating, secretly harmed himself in a dark room, and gradually lost his vitality. He became essence-depleted and brain-weak, his thinking ability sharply declined, and his studies were affected. He began to force himself to quit, but it had already caused seminal emission and nocturnal emission. The frequency of emissions increased, coupled with insomnia and forgetfulness, mental depression, and great distress. His muscles became thin, and his complexion was withered and yellow. Until last autumn, he was introduced by his classmate, Mr. Lu, to come to me for treatment. (Present symptoms): Essence depletion, muscle wasting, blood deficiency, body weakness. (Treatment): ... I instructed him to purchase "Ximitushi Sperm-Consolidating Pills" from Zhongying Pharmacy to treat his seminal emission and nocturnal emission, and also to supplement his essence and blood, strengthen his muscles, and strengthen his body, I also instructed him to take "Shengzhisu" for targeted treatment. In four or five weeks, all symptoms were eliminated, as if he had been reborn in Chongqing.</p>

<h3 id="e221">Reconsider the Ban on Dancing <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Ji</p>
<p>The First Special District City Federation has again submitted a petition to the Municipal Government to ban dance halls, reiterating the previous proposal to "maintain social order by rectifying public morals."</p>
<p>The reasons for "petitioning for a ban" are the same as those presented before: "Detailing the four harms and first implementing the two restrictions."</p>
<p>It is commendable that the gentlemen of the City Federation are concerned about "social peace and the future of the entire nation and people," and therefore express disapproval of "the abnormal development of dance halls in Shanghai today, which attract young men and women every night, dancing and singing wildly all night long, and indulging in licentiousness to the extreme," and petition for a ban. However, after expressing our support, we cannot remain silent.</p>
<p>Between the first petition for a ban and this second petition, dance halls have undergone significant changes in the past few months: First, small dance halls charging one yuan for eight dances or ten dances have sprung up like mushrooms after rain; second, dance halls compete with "erotic dances," "conventions," and "mysterious performances" to attract dancers; third, they extend the hours, adding "tea dances" in addition to "evening dances," and even "offering exquisite refreshments" to compete; fourth, in addition to these, what has "abnormally developed" even more recently is the rise of dance schools or dance art research societies that are in fact disguised as cheaper small dance halls. The dancers in these dance schools are mostly junior employees of general stores. From these phenomena, we can see that dancing has spread from gentlemen and ladies and wealthy youths to the common people. However, now that dancing has become a popular hobby among the general public, if we pay close attention to the situation in the dance halls, we can discover two other things: the so-called "observers" sitting in the dance halls who do not dance are much more numerous than the dancers, and although new dance halls seem to spring up like mushrooms after rain, those that close down one after another are also numerous.</p>
<p>From the above facts, we can also see the "ever-declining" state of dance halls. Why are dance halls in an ever-declining state, and yet penetrating into the common people? We only need to think carefully to know that this is not without reason. China is now an era of suffering. Those who cannot bear the torment of this suffering turn to the path of decadent, chronic suicide. For example, many students who recently returned from petitioning vowed on the train that they would spend the rest of their lives in song and dance halls.</p>
<p>This is just one example. Another example is a young man "who once studied in France" reported in the same newspaper, who was sued by a dance hall owner for issuing bad checks because he was "unemployed at home after returning to the country." The youths in this society are either weak and chronically suicidal or strong and "taking risks!"</p>
<p>The method of treating the head when the head hurts and treating the foot when the foot hurts is only conceived by mediocre doctors when they have no other choice; moreover, this is still the method of "cutting off the head when the head hurts!"</p>
<p>As for the issue of the future of the dance girls and those who depend on dance halls for a living after the ban on dancing, that is secondary.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Departure <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>—Returning Home in Bitter Snow, Part 5</p>
<p>This long line, like a snake, lay on the snowy ground. Except for the lead car, the rest were without roofs. This so-called lead car was not like an ordinary passenger car; on the Beijing-Shanghai line, it would just be a baggage car.</p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn’t have any windows. Two iron doors were separated at both ends of the car, and inside was one large, undivided compartment!</p>
<p>So, we spread out our mats and nailed them to the iron plates on top. We did the same on the opposite side, just barely leaving a rectangular opening for entry and exit. In this way, the large compartment was divided into three sections. The southern side was occupied by our group, the other side by several attendants from the arena. And what about the passageway in the middle? Several friends in distress, whose names we didn't know, also moved in under a sense of sorrow.</p>
<p>After lunch, everyone's boxes and baskets were brought onto the car. The remaining mats were spread flat on the iron plates like carpets. Luggage was spread out without any particular order, and the boxes were piled high in one corner.</p>
<p>The day was really short. It got dark. Zhang Shun came over, lit the kerosene lamp, and casually asked if we wanted anything to eat. Then, he turned and left.</p>
<p>"Come here!" Old Qiu called out to him. "Check if we have enough water. Prepare more hard candy, in case we get delayed on the road!"</p>
<p>For some reason, we always felt that Old Qiu's face didn't look good, as if he had something to worry about.</p>
<p>"Will we actually be able to leave today?" Little Wei said, breaking the calm air.</p>
<p>"Nine o'clock," he said, looking at his watch. "Just wait, there are still three hours."</p>
<p>Listen, the engine in front let out a sound, and then the car moved a little. Perhaps an lonely old mother is waiting for the return of her wandering son? The sound carried a slight message. What shall I use to comfort her heart? Bitterness surged from the depths of my heart straight to my nose. Unable to suppress this painful sorrow, tears fell. But I didn't dare let others see, and I buried my head in the quilt. Alas, how could I not be careful of them resenting this unfortunate action, on the part of a 毛孩子 who is receiving the grace of others!</p>
<p>"Everyone," Old Qiu said to the people in the aisle, "There is something I need to clarify. Riding the car is not a problem, but if something goes wrong on the road, or we encounter an inspection, the responsibility..."</p>
<p>Many eyes looked at Old Qiu, thinking. They didn't say anything. Naturally, what could they say? Relying on the eaves of others, needing the giving of the spring breeze, being terrified—it was simply like creatures trembling on a tightrope. Rather than suffer the attack of fear, it was better to take a chance. They and I shared the same fate!</p>
<p>Soon, the wheels pressed against the thin ice on the tracks. The weather was so cold that people couldn't stretch out their hands.</p>
<p>"I hope this trip goes smoothly and we can return to Tianjin safely!"</p>
<h3 id="e223">Willow <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Mingxia</p>
<p>Originally, a topic like this should be written by someone as erudite as Mr. Zhou Zuoren to produce an outstanding article. Someone as shallow as I am is really "not the right choice." But just as Mr. Zhou Zuoren said, finding a topic is not easy, so I'll still write a little now.</p>
<p>Willow, or just called "Liu," according to legend, Yang Guang opened the Grand Canal and had people plant willows along the banks. Later, when he went down to Yangzhou, the lush shade provided coolness along the way, so he bestowed the surname "Yang" upon them. This legend doesn't seem to be entirely accurate, because in</p>
<h3 id="e224">Nonsense <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— (Bragging)</p>
<p>On the 13th, the countries that signed the Locarno Treaties met in London. British Foreign Secretary Chamberlain went out first, looking worried. Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Halifax and Italian Ambassador Grandi followed, also looking concerned. Tan Laosan said that this meeting must have been filled with gloom and sadness, not at all like attending a dance or a viewing party. Why? "Watching others carry burdens doesn't seem hard, but when you put it on your own shoulders, your mouth twists in pain."</p>
<p>Next to the Kunning Palace in the Forbidden City, there are three side rooms that are tightly closed and have never been opened. Even when Puyi left the palace and the Forbidden City Preservation Committee was organized, they were not inspected. The inventory of the Forbidden City doesn't record any antiquities in these rooms. Tan Laosan said that this shows how diligent the members of the Forbidden City Committee are in their work.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Before Yang Guang, there were already lines in the classics such as "In the past when I went, the willows were lush," so the name "willow" has "a long history." Naturally, according to those who are knowledgeable in the study of things, "Yang" and "Liu" are originally two different kinds of trees. So, after "In the past when I went, the willows were lush," there is "Now when I return, the rain and snow are heavy." Rain and snow are naturally two different things, and this is certainly correct. But we don't know whether the poets of that time were as concerned with parallelism as later generations, especially since the two characters "rain" and "snow" can also mean "snowing."</p>
<p>Even so, in our hometown, Yang and Liu are indeed two different kinds of trees. Willow droops, while Yang stretches upwards. Naturally, some people say that if you plant a poplar tree upside down, it will become a weeping willow, but in practice, this is not true.</p>
<p>Among all trees (except evergreens), willow is the most characteristic of spring, because it is the first to bud when spring arrives, and it becomes lush and dark green as spring deepens. Because of this, the poet mentioned above used it as a representative of spring, saying "The willows are lush" to hint at spring. Later, even when faced with the helplessness of spring's departure, they hoped to use willow branches to tie it back.</p>
<p>Willows were probably originally a product of the south. "Trees are like this, how can people bear it?" The "like this" tree refers to the willows of southern Hubei. Therefore, in Lao Can's Travels, describing the scenery of Jinan, it is said, "Every house has springs, every household has weeping willows, resembling Jiangnan."</p>
<p>Among all trees, willows are also the easiest to grow. Anything that grows easily is certainly not strong. Therefore, "The weak willow's shape anticipates willow first withering." Taking willow to be mentioned alongside the herbaceous cattail, the ancients said, "It takes ten years to grow a tree." I think that only willow trees can be grown in ten years; at least pine, cypress, elm, and nan trees take at least thirty or forty years. In our hometown, there is even a saying, "A willow tree surrounding a house indicates a newly rich family," saying that if a house is only surrounded by willow trees, it must be a newly rich family, because if it were a family that had been wealthy for generations, it would definitely be surrounded by elm and nan trees.</p>
<p>"Many are planted in Jiangnan near water." This is a statement about willows that has merit. Actually, it's not necessary to plant them near water; they can be planted anywhere, because they grow easily, so they are found everywhere near pavilions and bridges. In ancient times, farewells mostly took place on land at pavilions and by water at bridges. At that time, people would look up and see willow trees, so they would reach out and break off some willow branches to give as farewell gifts, either intentionally or forgetting their horse whips and using them as substitutes. In short, because they were encountered frequently during farewells, willow trees subtly became a symbol of reluctance to part. Naturally, there are countless examples of this.</p>
<p>Willows are green and drooping. Their beauty lies in their swaying grace, and it just so happens that a woman's waist is also considered beautiful when it is slender and swaying. Therefore, poets even compared willows to women's waists. "With golden reins and jade bridles, he gazes in the wind, recognizing Yang's quiet and gentle waist." "Don't let them be moved into the Linghe Palace; three thousand palace maids would be jealous of her." Isn't this good evidence?</p>
<p>Because they "wither first in autumn," autumn willows are even more of a source of sadness for poets. There are countless autumn willow poems from ancient times; I won't mention them all here. Bai Shidaoren's ci poems are rare masterpieces throughout the ages. In "Wretched Grief," he has the following lines:</p>
<p>"In the alleys of Hefei, willows are planted everywhere. In the autumn wind at dusk, they rustle softly. When I lived there, with my door closed, I heard the neighing of a horse. I went out of the city and looked around, and all I saw was desolate smoke and wild grass, an unbearable sadness."</p>
<p>Although this doesn't specifically talk about autumn willows, everything he describes truly captures the spirit of autumn willows. This, along with "Trees are like this," can probably be considered the two greatest writings on "willow"!</p>
<p>There is a willow tree outside the window. Although the spring is as cold as water, there are already some sprouts in this continuous spring rain. Around Qingming and Hanshi, there will probably be many children climbing and breaking off tender branches to make willow balls. "Wearing willows on Qingming" — I am immersed in a sea of memories again. The rain keeps falling.</p>

<p>Opening: "Dream of the Red Chamber"</p>
<p>Jia Yucun cherishes a talented lady in the wind and dust. Zhen Shiyin recognizes a spiritual being in a dream. A stone at the foot of the Great Desolate Mountain is spiritual. It follows the vague and misty path to the mortal world. Returning to its original source, its spirit is not extinguished. It is used by the empty one to create a strange text. Outside Gusu City, there is the Gourd Temple. The neighbor next door is named Zhen. They are both called Squire Shiyin. They have no sons but a single daughter at their knees. Her name is Yinglian, and they cherish her like a treasure. She is only three years old and intelligent. One day, she puts down her book and falls asleep. She dreams of two monks and a Taoist talking about her past life. They say that a romantic debt of splendor has descended to the mortal world. On the banks of the Spirit River, there is the Crimson Pearl Grass. It deeply feels the grace of Divine Stone's irrigation. It wants to repay the kindness with tears and hugs. Hearing a clap of thunder, she awakens from her illusory dream. At the door, she sees a crazy monk holding a girl. With a lame Taoist,</p>

<p>Nora is playing hide-and-seek with the children. Krogstad comes again. He questions Mrs. Linde about whether she wants a position in the bank. He asks Nora to secure his position for him. Furthermore, he uses the IOU with Nora’s forged signature of her father’s name as leverage. He openly says, "Many years ago I had a bit of trouble. Although it never went to court, since then every path forward for me has been blocked. Now I want to turn over a new leaf. I must try my best to restore my reputation. This position in the bank is the first step for me to climb up. I don’t want your husband to kick me off the ladder and back into the gutter." Finally, he says, "The thing I did that caused me to lose my reputation and be unacceptable to society is exactly the same as what you did, not one bit more, not one bit less."</p>
<p>Nora says, "I don’t believe it. Does the law not allow a daughter to find a way to prevent her dying father from being worried? Does the law not allow a wife to save her husband's life? If so, this must be a stupid law!"</p>
<p>Krogstad says coldly, "The law doesn't care about a person's intentions."</p>

<p>a person approaches. He sees Yingmai weeping loudly. Shiyin is returning to his study to see his good friend. It is Jia Yucun, who has settled in the temple. He sells his writings for a living. They sip tea and chat and laugh. From outside the window, there is the sound of coughing. He sees a flower-picking maid with a graceful demeanor. A smile and a glance are filled with affection. Shiyin is inviting Yucun to enjoy the Mid-Autumn Festival together. At the banquet, he generously gives Yucun money for travel expenses. Yucun is rushing to seek fame the next morning. It happens to be the Lantern Festival night. Shiyin is losing Yinglian. Where can he find her? When the flowers are falling, the God of Fire arrives. Burning down the house, he joins his father-in-law. After two or three years, he realizes the truth and becomes a monk. Following the crazy and deranged Taoist. Madam Feng is heartbroken. In the middle of the night, there is a knock at the door. It turns out to be the maid Jiaoxing, a lucky star.</p>

<p>With a temper like fierce fire, the brave Huanhou. Sworn brothers in the Peach Garden, sharing a bond of loyalty. Raising the banner to quell the Yellow Turban rebels. Once whipped a corrupt official in Anxi. Who can break through Hulao Pass? Killing until Lü Bu is shamed with cut hair and a displaced crown. His imposing presence overwhelms the many lords. After the brothers are scattered, it is difficult to see each other. Only because the troops are weak and the generals are few, he is trapped in Xuzhou. One is swearing an oath not to surrender to Cao first. Alone he is besieged on Tushan Mountain. One is going far north to rely on Yuan Shao. One is gathering troops, horses, money, and supplies in Gucheng. In Gucheng, they meet, clarifying their hearts. Relieving suspicions, he is fortunate to behead Cai Yang. Cao's millions of soldiers are on the path to Dangyang. With a roar, he wields his serpent spear. The waters of Changban Bridge flow in reverse. He righteously releases Yan Yan, once treating him as a subordinate. The treacherous roads of Shu are easily conquered. The resourceful military advisor is still one step behind. At Waqianzhai, he is drunk all day. Suddenly, the rough and rash general has wisdom. He cleverly deceives Zhang He, securing Zhongzhou. Outside Jiameng Pass, he raises his banner and drums. Wielding double spears, gods and demons are worried. Killing until the stars shift, the battle does not end. Long stationed in Xichuan, who dares to invade? All his life, he hates not avenging his brother. He whips his strong soldiers, heavily instructing them. Fan Jiang and Zhang Da stab his throat. If the general is delayed for a moment, he will die. Why fear that the mountains and rivers will not belong to Liu? How can autumn grass not grow, leaving sorrow all over the ground?</p>

<p>Shanghai (1100) 4:00 PM to 4:45 PM Opening: "Liu Bei"</p>
<p>Descendant of Prince Jing of Zhongshan in the Han Dynasty. The imperial uncle, his reputation known throughout the world. With an extraordinary appearance, yet poor and bare. How can his aspirations be realized in life? Sworn brothers in the Peach Garden, the three of them. Praying to the gods, not betraying their oath. Working together to quell the Yellow Turbans. Clad in coarse clothes, people inevitably underestimate him. A weaver of mats and maker of shoes. For his merits, he is awarded the official position of Anxi County. His fame shakes the world at Hulao Pass. Relying on Yuan Shao and Liu Biao. No match for Cao Cao's millions of troops. Temporarily borrowing Jingzhou to take refuge, then entering into marriage with the Wu kingdom. The brother-in-law harbors the heart of an enemy country after all. Afterward, he enters Sichuan and establishes the Shu Han Dynasty. He actually stands as one of the three powers. The military advisor, Mr. Zhuge Liang, devises a plan. He urges the officials to submit a memorial. For Cao Cao not to claim the title of emperor, let him be a lord. Guan and Zhang are killed, and Jingzhou is lost. Helplessly, the linked camps are burned. On his deathbed, he entrusts the orphan and supports the young master. Liu Shan is over forty years old. He is granted the title of Prince of Anle for his whole life. He compiles the writings of Master Zhu in his own hand. The Shu Han Dynasty is ultimately the orthodox ruler. Respectfully supporting the small imperial court of the Southern Song Dynasty.</p>

<p>Shirley Temple's latest masterpiece, "The Littlest Rebel," was very popular when it was screened at the Grand Theater last time. It is said that it will be re-screened at the theater for two days starting today.</p>
<p>"Red-Handed King" (Professional Soldier) is a grand production recently assembled by the 20th Century Fox Company with the highest level of manpower and financial resources. The director of the film is David Butler, the director of "Malaysian Pirates". The protagonists of the film are Freddie Bartholomew, the child star of "David Copperfield", and Victor McLaglen, the heroic hero of "The Lost Patrol". This is a war-themed, comedic, palace-intrigue extravaganza, which will be released at the Grand Theater after "The Little Heroine".</p>
<p>Since "The Movie Fan" (Keystone Hotel), comedian Harold Lloyd has had almost no new films released for three years. Harold Lloyd's new film, "The Milky Way," which has been rumored in foreign magazines for a long time, has been shipped to China, according to the Shanghai Paramount branch. It is expected that it will soon meet the people of Shanghai on the screen.</p>
<p>"The Clairvoyant" is a mysterious and bizarre film about the protagonist's ability to see the past and predict future misfortunes, but he almost lost his life because of it. The actors are the best male actor, Claude Rains, and Miss Fay Wray. It is said that it is scheduled to be released at the Cathay Theater today (Wednesday).</p>
<h3 id="e231">"Rose Marie" <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>This opera, "Rose Marie," which moved the world ten years ago, was originally a musical opera produced in 1924 by the great playwright Arthur Hammerstein. When it was performed at the Imperial Theatre in New York, it was a great success and lasted for two years. It was re-edited in 1927. Now, MGM has starred in it with the silver screen darlings Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy and directed by W. S. Van Dyke. The music and songs in the film are all guided and created by the famous American musicians Rudolf Friml and Herbert Stothart. Therefore, the famous songs in the film, such as the Indian "Indian Love Call", "Rose Marie", and Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet", are all extremely precious. The totem pole dance, sincere open history of wonders, is blessed to those who love music and movies.</p>

<p>According to "Tip News," Huang Gongtian will soon be traveling to Nanchang. Nanchang is the source of the New Life Movement. After putting on a Zhongshan suit, he should shave his head like a monk to appear more revolutionary. However, dancing is not allowed, and Nanchang probably doesn't have spring-loaded dance floors like the Yangtze Dance Hall.</p>
<p>(Confucius said: And Nanchang probably doesn't have a second Miss Mary!)</p>
<p>"Spring Flower" was officially released today. Under heavy "scissors," I wonder if it can be as expected, "using many of the most factual advantages to win over a wide audience and praise"?</p>
<p>The news of the resurrection of the Dian Tong Company is quite impressive. According to sources, Ma Dejian has agreed to produce Sun Shiyi's "Streets and Alleys" with 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>It is said that Chaplin's new work "Modern Times" after "City Lights" will be released simultaneously by Nanjing and Da Shanghai Theaters.</p>
