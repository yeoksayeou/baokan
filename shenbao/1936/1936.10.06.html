<p>時評</p>
<h3>今後的中日談判</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>日本外務者東亞局長桑島昨日到滬。要把廣田首相和外陸海三相最近所决定的新訓令。傳達給川越大使。已吿中斷的中日調整國交的談判又有繼續的希望了。桑島帶來的新訓令。內容如何。因為雙方當局嚴守秘密的緣故。我們無從探知。然而就現在的情勢看來。我們却也可以推想到。那新訓令所指示的交涉方針。比川越巳經提出的一切要求來。在性質上也許和緩些。在範圍上也許縮小些。但是骨子裏一定仍然含有着充分的侵略精神。在上月二十三日的中。日談判中我國政府顯巳拒絕了川越大使的要求。自此以後。華北日軍準備着示威性質的大規模演習。上海日陸戰隊甚至把警戒綫擴充到蘇州河畔。而日本當局又口口聲聲說是準備在必要時作有效的應付。險惡的陰霾的確在遠東的天空聚集起來。危害着和平。然而明眼人郤很容易斷定。在這時際使用武力是于日本極大不利的。現在中國在政治上經濟上軍事上已經完成了統一的局面。在民衆方面。愛國的情緒也高漲到了極度。至于日本則不但財政沒有出路。而且對遠東方面其他列强的國際關係也還未好轉。大家知道。日本慣于取巧。除非抓住九一八當時那樣的機會是不肯輕易使用武力的。它當然極不願意在目前對中國開戰。日本常局那樣的散播着戰爭空氣。誠如東京外人所傳。無非是策動華北獨立的一種威脅作用罷了。这次桑島到中國來。正表示着日本打算轉圖。日本總該把交涉方針修改得『近情』些了罷。</p>
<p>然而日本的根本國策是在擴張在華的勢力。它無論把交涉方針修改得怎樣『近情』。總非侵害到中國的獨立主權不可。况且現在是廣田三原則的起草人桑島。把新訓令帶來的而威脅的。情勢還不見消减下去。我們怎能指望日本對華的交涉方針有了什麽根本的修改呢。不過在今日的形勢之下。日本要打開外交的僵局。郤也不能不想到中日問題上一向發生着重大作用的因素。就是英國。因此它把交涉方針修改到可以獲得英國諒解的『近情』程度。是很有可能性的。我們記得李滋羅斯在離華的臨別贈言上勸吿過我國修正關稅。我們知道英國的保守分子一向把新興的日本當作牽制美俄兩强的重要勢力。可以默認日本在華北方面的自由行動。我們又知道英國是决不願中日兩國發生戰事的。那麼日本目下的交涉方針。是不是可以求得對英的妥協呢。這的確是値得我們注意的問題了。</p>
<p>就以上所說看來。我們對於今後的中日談判固然不能過於樂觀。而英國當局對於中國現局的密切關心。在我們也是不能過於樂觀的。</p>

<p>大會演說詞　諸君、我很榮幸而愉快的能參加此次的國際勞工大會海事會議、本會在全世界勞苦海員的熱望之下、使各國的政府僱主以及勞方的代表、相聚一堂、以求正義人道的維繫、余謹代表中國全體海員、慶祝大會成功、希望大會的工作、不僅能使中國以及全世界的海員滿意、且更以此消弭國際經濟競爭、而影響於海員之弊害、局長之報吿書、已將全世界海員情形分晰淸楚、關於中國海員的情形、余極願乘此機會、向諸君補充幾句、中國海員自各帝國主義者先後在中國取得內河航行權之後、卽開始為各外國輪船公司所雇用、因其勞力低賤、同時可收對華貿易及運輸上之便利、故百餘年來、人數日多、幾全世界都有中國海員之蹤跡、一九二二年（卽民國十一年）中國海員因求改善待遇上之不平等、以及取締包工制度、曾有一月十三日大規模之大罷工、此一頁空前的生活革命史、我想努力於社會和平的諸君、大槪都還記得、巴黎和會以後、中國海員期待國際上有平等待遇之規定、迨無日不在熱望之中、但十餘年來、中國海員之希望、不僅無絲毫進步、而若干外國輪船公司、特別為駐華之外國船公司、對於中國海員待過之苛刻、更日甚一日、茲謹舉共犖犖大者為睹君言之、一九二二年一月十三日、中國海員之大罷工、共目的為求不平等待遇之改善、及取締包工制度、己如上述、中國海員之痛恨同一工作而有不同待遇、以及包工制度之剝削、實甚於毒蛇猛獸、此决罷工之結果、雖然勝利屬於海員、但事後各船公司方面、不僅未履行其諾言、而且事過境遷、更逐漸變本加厲、直至現在、其僱用中國海員的手續，不求之於健全合法的中國海員工會、而逕與以營利及剝削為目的之包工頭議定極苛刻之僱用條伴、海員本身旣無選擇船舶之自由、對於僱用條件之內容更根本無參加意見之可能、於是包工頭一面以最低廉之工資、替船公司取得最艱苦之勞力、而向公司取得一部份剩餘的利潤外、一面照例又向海員索取種種介紹費、海員在雙重的剝削之下、欲求苟全生活而不可能、以致輕身自殺、時有所聞、船公司方面除掉利用包工頭來榨取海員的低廉勞力外、復向海員强迫收取一種押櫃金、每人自三百元至七百元不等、海員迫於失業的恐慌、不得不以最高利息、借貸繳納、以中國海員之低價勞力、最高者每　每入不過四十四元、最低者每月每人祇得八元、欲求維持其一家或個人之生活且不可能、焉有餘力償付利息、諸君、此種悲慘之事實、苟不卽行取締、則中國海貝迫於生存的要求、其結果恐不能想像、吾人從經濟的觀點、及人類和平的觀點而言、假使平等待遇的問題不規定、不人道以及不合法的制度不消除、則資本家旣有這許多的便宜可佔、必將儘量地僱用勞力低賤的海員、以從事於國際或私人企業之競爭、其結果不僅中國海員將永淪於牛馬生活中、而各國海員亦將蒙受極大的不利、因為資本家一方面旣以最低廉的代價、儘量地換取中國海員最艱苦的勞力、一方面必至儘量地欺騙或减少僱用共本國的高價海員、歷年以來、世界經濟及失業的恐慌、日趨嚴重、居留於外國之中國海員、上受當地政府之歧視、下受當地同一階級的海員之排斥、其原因雖不止一端、而其普通的心理、卽視為中國海員已佔有其生活位置、如是海員發生種族之歧視與敵視、欲求人類和平、豈非空想、諸君、吾人固都為求入類和平而來、吾人不能坐視着人類鬥爭的趨勢、日趨嚴重、而袖手不顧、應知人類和平的道路、决不是勞力或資方以及政府單獨一方面可以建築得起來、而是要大家開明一致的努力、欲求打破這個危機、我認為祇有立刻將中國的海員待遇平等、此外我還有一件事、要向諸君報吿、一九二七年（卽民國十六年）六月、香港政府藉口共黨搗亂、將中國海員工會的香港分會加以封閉、近幾年來雖經迭决向港政府交涉、給果皆等於零、夫工人結社自由、乃世界文明國家之法律所許可、中國海員工會在中國政府法令的監督之下、是一個保護海員經濟利益的組織、港政府之至今不許港分會的恢復、是否誤認中國海員工會是一個有政治作用的機關、是否法治文明地港政府的政策、不許有合法的海員組織、誠百思而莫得一解、中國海員酷愛和平、不至不得已時、决不希望再有第二次「一九二二」年的大罷工、所以忍受忍耐、十年於茲、余今代表余中國的海員、請求國際公道的援助、希望國際勞工局對於這個問題、亦給中國海員一個有力帮助、最後余謹宣言中國海員對於國際勞工組織之工作及政策、是十二分的擁護、相信國際勞工大會是人類和平及一切公道之門、而給中國以及全世界的海員一個很滿意的答復的、</p>

<h3>沈聿恭談世運籃球　我國失敗情形　連大會規則都還不懂　董守義要負相當責任</h3>
<p>我國世運籃球隊在歐慘敗消息傳來後、舉國莫不同憤、現全體代表、業　歸國抵滬、國光社記者、咋値良華老隊員世運代表沈聿恭君於德鄰公庽、承吿我國籃球隊在大會中失敗情形如下、</p>
<p>沈君稱、關於我國籃球隊的慘敗原因、在體力未復、神經興奮等老調、當然也是一因、但最重大的、我想要由董先生（守義）負責的、因為董先生在淸華訓練的時候、敎訓的都是新規則、好像罰球中了、不必再到中綫去跳球、跑兩步要算犯規、並且打的多是十秒鐘的新規則、想不到這一次他們還採用的是一九三四年以前的老規則、所以一到那邊、我們所學的、都非所用、趕緊改變方法、都因為手脚不順、而格格不入了、到了大會中臨比賽那一夭、董先生又病了、眞的病了、他雖然也同具着勝利的心理、曾經在賽前表示過、他一定要抱病登塲、後來醫院裏警吿他說、出去了假使發生危險、他們不能負責、終於董先生慌了、呌了李　安先生去、可囑他許多臨陣的策略、可是董先生心裏所想到的、與比賽時的情形、完全不同、因此李先生也無法應付、因為他要運守董先生的囑咐、不能隨便主張、譬如董先生囑咐他在什麼情形時應當換人、李先生到了裏　、一見他們是不許換人的、卽使不得已而換人、也就不能換上去了、並且限定入塲的至多七人、所以他也慌得無法措施、你想、指導是一軍的主帥、現在指揮乏人、臨陣的隊員、當然又多了一種顧忌、怎樣不敗呢、</p>
<p>總之、我們是有負了國家的付托、而失敗了、但是回想了當時情形、也不無遺憾、那就是我國的缺乏組織、</p>
<p>在大會籃球未開始以前、日本的隊員、看見我們練習時的技術、他們甚至要求大會當局改換比賽秩序、想不與我國遇於初賽中、但是我們沒有知道、一直到了臨塲的時候、纔知道一切、關於日本要求的事、也是後來才知道的、在當　、誰不預測着是我們勝的呢、</p>
<p>至于美國隊的技術、當然他們個子的高大、佔了不少便宜、但是他們的敎練、也與我們不可同日而語了、他們在上半時儘管去失收、在下半時總可以勝過米、這就是指導的有力、因為他們的指導、祇下須一個晤示、全隊就像另換了一隊、一切的戰略、都隨着指導的意思去打、至于他　的傳遞從來不會落入人家的手內、更加個子高大、球就尙在他們的手中了、卽使他們到了極不得已的時候、他們也有一種戰法、就是一面遠遞、中鋒站在相當地位、跨兩步就可放入籃內、但是他們不願意這樣做、</p>
<p>後來記者問到天津良華隊情形，他說、良華老隊員、現在都為了衣食關係、而奔走四方了、所以以後良華的勁旅、恐怕也不容易組成、論理、一個團體的力量、要顧到隊員的生活、而使之永久集合、那是不可能的、所以我也希望政府出來組織一個國家球隊、積極的訓練、怕不能在下屆世運會中爭雄馬、</p>
<p>最後他說、在滬尙有一二天躭擱、後天七日北上、至徐兆熊因為他的家住在上海、所以他暫時不會到天津去、</p>

<h3>參加世運　歐遊雜感　復興的德意志（一）</h3>
<p>— 李惠堂</p>
<p>英諺有云、『天助自助者』、德國人的自治精神、無論男女都有透切的認識、在一個偉大的塲合裏、他們分工辦事、祇有協助、却不倚賴、就是男女間也極無他地客氣的習慣、在車中年靑的婦女很少有人讓坐的、除了年事過高、或四肢殘廢的人們外、總是各走各的路、從沒有理會他人的、也沒有希望人家理會他、家庭中中等以下的人家、從不夢想到僕役兩個字、家中什務總是主婦自己親自料理、也就是富庶之家、也很少僱員的、社會上的職業、也分配得極為平均、聽說嫁了丈夫的婦人、有了丈夫去維持她的生活、便不許再找事做、免致阻塞他人的機會、因此德國境內失業的工人、是絕少絕少、總之、他們－尤其是婦女們－那種自治的精神、確令人敬佩的、</p>
<p>（七）體育的提出與獎勵</p>
<p>德國民族的健全男女的雄壯、推其原由、大都是政府與社會提倡體育之偉大收穫、在任何城市中體育的塲所、遍地皆是、同時養息的地方也顧慮週到、像柏林數百萬人口的大城、土地雖是寸金尺土、但城的當中、却是一座一室無際森翠的大園林、聽說在小學裏已開始强迫懈育的中學大學裏體育更成為必修的科目了、德國人擊劍的古風、還未泯絕、我們在路上常可看見面帶疤痕的壯士、創痕的多寡、是經騐深淺的表徵、創疤愈多、愈得女人們的敬愛、他們愛護英雄和體育家、眞非他國所能及、像那賣技式的拳術大家『史美林』、舉國當他是民族英雄般愛戴、連元首希德婁、也親自勉嘉、又像这次大會中新五項運動的優勝者是德國的一位軍官、他獲勝的第二天、竟被擢陞兩級、這樣榮耀而又爽心怏意的事情、誰不想努力去播散佳種、用心培植、希冀着將來有同樣的收穫、誰不要向體育一途去特別地痛下苦功、聞說政府和社會、最近幾年來、把各項的體育、都樹立標準、無論何人、能　得上或超過那樣準的、都按照成績來頒發獎章、或獎狀、有相當功夫的人、隨時隨地、可去試騐、這眞是一種　良的提倡和獎勵的辦法、這一决德國在大會裏、得着優異的佳績、良非無因、某體育雜誌說得妙、「體育的進展端賴平素的培植滋長、與文化相輔而行、一朝一夕的訓練是徒勞無功』、“Atuleticprogress　is　fron　growthand　culture，and　not　frommere　training”我國總是臨渴掘井、弄那揠苗助長的把戲、怎能比得上人家、</p>
<p>（八）商品價格劃一</p>
<p>我們初到德國去購買紀念物品、為了要審愼一點、探聽各處的貨價、却跑了無限的寃枉路程、原來德國所有本地或外來的商品、都經過總商會評議過、價格劃一不二的、任您由城東走到城西、同樣的一件貨物、總找不出有便宜一點價格、如果有人私自廉價出售商品、政府查出來是要嚴重處罰的、但其中仍有猶太商店，遇有熟人介紹、可以打個折扣、此類的勾當、是秘密中之秘密、不能讓人家知道的、德國近來排斥猶太人、恐怕這也是其中之一原因罷、商品價格劃一、可以袪除奸商商們攏斷、詐取欺騙等等流弊、確屬有益社會人羣、希望我國的商會、也起而效允、雖則我國地大物博、幹起來有點困難、但如果各地的商會、不憚蔴煩地協力共幹、也必有做得到之一日、</p>
<p>以上所舉八端、是我知到較為詳盡、足以師法的事實、其他像建設的宏麗、（均科學化）軍警之威武、交通的利便、（單就柏林一地而言、交通有火車、長途汽車、電車、地底車、天面車、飛艇、飛機、卽電車一項、全市有一百七十餘路、汽車近三十萬輛）、都是德人足以自豪的、我並不是替牠吹牛、但事實告給我們、我國事事在相形之下、益覺醜拙、我愛國雖不後人、但也不敢為之强辯諱飾、掩住自己良心、來埋沒了人家的好處、不過事在人為、今日的德意志、並不是上天造成和賜予的、是牠本身的掙扎和奮鬥得來的佳果、同是方趾圓顫、人家可以成功的事、我們奚必畏懼、願同胞們戮力一心、起來奮鬥、大奮衆鬥起來、趕上前去、</p>
<h3>二千公尺跑　更新世界紀錄</h3>

<p>（一）省短期小學創設伊始、由該廳統籌全局、分區派員主持辦理、因能如期成立、辦法一致、設計周密、準備充足、辦理甚屬盡力、唯因時間忽促、敎員訓練時期略短、應於再度訓練時略予延長、</p>
<p>（二）視察所經各縣如靑城·齊東·臨淄·益都·濰縣·黃縣·蓬萊·平原等處短期小學、學生人數充實、敎員工作緊張、形式整齊、精神振作、大體均有相當成績、殊堪嘉許、</p>
<p>（三）該廳以各縣第五科為中心、所組設之各地小學通訊網辦法、於傳達政令、介紹知識、促成聯絡等事、均有實效、惟應將小學通訊及基礎敎育月刊擴大取材範圍、力求充實、</p>
<p>（四）一般短期小學學生成績、與初小二年級修業終了時程度相當、其年齡稍長者、則相當於初小三年級上期之程度、若能延續一年、略可等於初小畢業、該廳原有擇定一部分短小延長一年之計畫、似應准予試辦、按之河南省立開封敎育實騐區、原有兩年半完成初小四年課程之試騐、已著有成績、但其入學年齡、仍以小學學齡為準、短小學齡較高、以兩年修畢初小四年課程允多可能、如將來辦有成績、則以鄉村初小、改辦短小、效力增加、當以倍計、</p>
<p>（五）根據全省實際狀况、擴充短期義務、不出兩途、一為保留原有學校基礎、繼統辦理、一為就未經設校地址、從新設立、依現在情勢考察、已有平均設置、稍涉零散之感、雖小學通訊網」推行盡利、已難完全補救、應斟酌各地實情　於鄉鎭適中地點、就學校基礎較　而失學兒童較多者、增加學級、不必限定一校一班、校長應擇素有成績者選用、藉以樹立短期小學之中心、而收聯絡統一之實效、</p>
<p>（六）一般短期小學、女生人數較多、膠東各縣幾乎盡為女生、男生幾於絕跡、其女生中年齡較大者、允不乏人、家事訓練、頗有需要、應於下屆甄別敎員時、兼用籍隸本貫、身體强健、資格相符之女敎員、以求事實上之便利、</p>
<p>（七）長山列島旣為特區、不隸蓬萊、應予設置短期小學、其或就島民分居情形、由廳規定設立校數、或照人口數目比照同等縣分成案、應由該廳酌定辦理、</p>
<p>（八）靑城縣長楊承榮、蒞任未久、能就貧瘠之區、多方籌畫、於短期之內、將全縣義務敎育完全普及、實屬熱心盡職、應請嘉獎、以示鼓勵、</p>
<p>（九）膠東各縣一般小學、校舍設備、均有可觀、但帥資頗不整齊、敎法亦多陳舊、應由該廳擇適中地點、（烟台或濰縣）派定專員、主持舉辦訓練班。講習會。研究會等、授以敎學訓育之實際知識、並啟發其興趣、以變風尙、而資改進</p>
<p>（十）省立弟一實騐小學、省立濟南女師附屬小學、濟南市立第一實騐小學、過去實騐工作、已著成績、今後設施計畫、正在推行、大體均切實研求、甚為努力、其他未經視察之相負實騐工作之各小學當亦不乏優良之選、唯實小及附小之設置、皆負有輔導地方小學之使命、除一般的硏究外、宜考察地方小學之實際問題、兼為硏究工作之對象、如省立第一實騐小學、業已執行各縣地方小學之輔導、自應首先趨重各縣完全小學之改進辦法、其鄰近之實小及附小、自不必與該校研究同一之問題、又如省立濟南女師附小對於敎材編選、已有基礎、他校原不必羣趨於自編敎材之一途、儘可另擇其他工作、以求供獻、現在濟南城廂各小學、自編敎材、成為一時風尙、立意求勝、則偏枯掛漏之弊、反所難免、敎育問題本極廣泛、應力矯合掌雷同之風、冀收分工合作之效、</p>
<p>（十一）該廳設立之儀器標本兩製造所、開辦未久、成績赫然可觀、現在小學應備之科學用具、巳無須購自津滬、兼以價廉物美、易於普及、允為難能可貴、唯兩所設置僅六千元、廠所器械、仍多未備、應隨時注意擴充、</p>
<p>（十二）本年中等以上學校集中軍部、紀律嚴肅、精神健旺、辦理頗有成績、並對於風紀、勤務等項、能剴切向學生說明、坐收潛移默化之功、與敎育原理相械符合、允為可許、</p>
<p>（十三）省立第一第二兩民敎輔導區、辦理頗有精神、其中心事業已著有相當成績、第一民敎輔導區主任屈振騫、第二民敎輔導區主任楊翼心、均屬實心任事、不辭勞瘁、應予嘉獎、以示鼓勵、</p>
<p>（十四）省立民衆實騐學校、設於濟南城內、因環境關係、殊少實效、應遷往工業日見發達之濰縣、擇較為適中之地點與工廠及社會取得聯絡、繼續辦理、</p>

<p>依法執行　遷延乃月、始由該院定期本月二十三日將王彬彥抵押之房屋查封、詛料竟有自稱為閘北各界援助王彬彥因公受累理事會者、不明底蘊、貿然召集會議、發出通電、志在以非法手段、推翻法院確定判决效力、延緩執行、殊屬詫異、查最高法院判决確定王彬彥等於民國十四年、與江蘇省長兼軍事善後督辦而訂之契的、係在借據成立之後、可見主張該欵係為</p>
<p>維持地方　秩序籌墊軍事費用者、實係意圖影射、另有作用、誠恐各界莫明眞相、發生誤會、特託貴律師代為登報公告俾明是非」等語、王彬彦見此啟事、認為「意圖影射另有作用」兩語、與彼之信譽攸關、亦卽於民報刊登啟事、聲明當年三團體全部墊欵、共計四十七萬二千三百十二元二角、如謂彬彥所墊之欵、係屬影射、則其他各團體所墊之欵</p>
<p>豈均影射　耶、冀促該行所登啟事自行更正、或停止登載、因見其繼續刊登、王乃致函詰責、函云、「請貴行將借欵並非維持地方秩序籌　軍事費用之證據提出、昭吿世人、使彬彥無逃於欺罔政府、欺罔社會之罪、否則所有當時商借作為維持地方籌墊軍用之欵項發生不能淸理之影響、或政府動搖訂的之義務、以及彬彥名譽財產上之一切損失、當由貴行負其全責、惟希亮察</p>
<p>明白見復　」迄今未獲滿意答復、故王現延屠振鵠高朔等律師向第一特區地方法院對該行張榮薄曁代為登報之盧興原律師、提起妨害信用之刑事自訴、瀝述被吿登報散佈流言、妨害名譽信用之事實、請求依法懲治外、並附帶民訴要求賠償其甲子軍事墊欵二十二萬八千六百四十九元七角、蓋以被吿登報後、政府已不允撥還也、又要求賠償其個人經濟上之損失、每年五千元以十年計算、</p>
<p>共五萬元　昨日下午、由戴榮鐸推事傳審、原告王彬彥未曾親到、被吿張榮溥亦不投案、祗盧興原到庭、首卽提出反訴誣吿書狀，繼乃詳述其受該銀行委任辦理起訴王彬彥等不贖抵押案之經過手續、末乃謂王彬彥今番起訴、殊屬無聊、希圖憑空發財、不恤借題發揮、並可使我丢臉、此種風氣、我已屢受、實則人詣法庭、聽候法官</p>
<p>論斷是非　祇不能算係丢臉之事、倘認我為有罪、雖殺頭猶無怨、若無罪應請治原吿以誣吿之罪、今未見王到案、諒其愧於對我、應請庭上將原告傳案、秉公裁判、至張榮溥則已因事去港、日實與彼並無關係云云、原吿之律師隨亦將報紙呈案、聲明原吿下决自當到庭、並願指傳張榮溥、庭上遂諭改期本月十六日下午再訊、</p>

<p>期棉有巨量抵補</p>
<p>棉布回高、因紗市良好、兼之空方巨量抵補、致檯面乾涸、市價漸昇、但海外棉市、趨勢軟化、</p>
<p>棉價逐步漲</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因美棉續跌六至八磅音、印棉亦疲憊不振、大阪三品花跌二·三角、市塲人心平凡、各月微升五分至一角、詎料二盤、以紗市上漲、　豐錦昌突來　批購買、一時救過於供、市價忽然跳起三角半、迨至三收盤、依然良好、續漲五分至一角、　賣者益康·裕大·長豐·潤康·豐泰·益昶·長和·大孚·均屬零　、惟　豐　進二萬一千餘擔、錦昌亦購一萬　千餘擔、大昌成·　　昌·興　·　大·亦抵補不少、結果、各月比上日收盤價均漲三角至四角半、午後開盤、本月平平、惟遠月尚佳、二三盤無甚出入、但氣勢殊緊、因大戶扒空所致也、收盤尤硬、結果各月比上午收盤價再漲一·二角、本月跌五分、查賣出長豐一萬二千二百擔、益昶五千四百擔、潤康三千擔、信誠四千二百擔、豐泰二千五百擔、大康二千三百擔、源大三千九百擔、裕大六千三百擔、聚　三千一百擔、長和一萬二千六百擔、益康二千四百擔、華懋二千擔、買進錦昌一萬三千一百擔、　豐三萬四千七百擔、　昌五千八百擔、同和二千六百擔、源興昌三千二百擔、泰興四千一百擔、大昌成二千四百擔、振大二千七百擔、茲將一日間市價高低列表於後、</p>

<p>印度棉產懼成頗順利</p>
<p>上週市塲因法郎貶值、引起投機興味、全週趨勢甚堅、惟所有交易、大半投機性質、在美棉下屆政府報告發表前、或將引起多頭了結、出口問訊平和、日本買進新棉、大陸方面、因金融不定、興味薄弱、棉收情形、大致順利、獨白羅溪花略在常年平均數之下、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、五日開盤預測、白羅溪為二百二十羅比、漲一羅比、奧姆辣為一百九十八羅比、漲一·五羅比、平果爾為一百五十七羅比、漲〇·七五羅比、</p>

<h3>疋頭　棉布現貨需要孔亟　原料紗綫不敷各廠出貨大减</h3>
<p>昨棉布市面、因時局稍告緩和、標紗花因現銷活躍而猛漲、棉布市盤、亦堅升、東疋細布·細斜漲價每疋五分、本廠細布、細斜亦漲五分至一角、輕磅粗布、粗斜售盤如故、而重磅粗布、粗斜最為鋒俏、漲每疋一角至二角、花色貨售盤與上週末彷彿、而現貨愈見緊俏、實緣市上需貨孔亟、而坯布及原料紗綫不敷之故、本色細布粗布亦一致缺乏現貨、如重磅十六磅粗布原有二十餘種牌子應銷、目前已减至六·七種、現貨尚零星派交、可見出品之寡、昨各帮交裝花絨綫呢直貢嗶嘰最為繁盛、均係當天各廠派出之貨、目下市盤雖逐步昂騰、而客　新成交轉形旺盛、人氣殊為興奮、以川滇閩粵兩地諸路為尤佳云、</p>
<h3>麥爾登市况超過平厚呢</h3>
<p>麥爾登最近趨勢益好、遠近客帮　有採辦、因軍政學界大批制服、十之六七俱用此呢、而到貨又薄、存底缺乏、大有越漲市面越好之象、其趨勢已超過平厚呢矣、昨頭　高檔麥爾登、每碼　批沽售三元八角半、最底下檔起碼貨、整箱每碼批沽二元二角半、</p>
<h3>糧食　津商暢辦粉　各月份均見新紀錄</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午　盤、各月份呈初平繼續猛提之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、均續好二三角左右、惟開價時、人心尚定、旋因天津粉銷旣暢、（近有七八萬之銷額）、價亦見提、因此人心逐步大佳、交易亦甚　旺、各月份　　　　週收價、計好三四分不等、迨至下午開盤、　　　　勢、更　嚴重、一二月份均在五角以外、　　月份之最高價竟達三元六角、（各月份均　新紀錄）、交易大暢、　盤以後、　本月份亦高、三角五分半、惟以逐步漲勢一盛、大戶多頭、　　利了結、故市氣逐步平靜、目下之漲風不退、大部分原因、初為津帮之動辦、終則仍為洋麥不能接近所致云、</p>

<h3>麥市漲風有謂未已</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份一致挺穩、因洋麥報價、續好二三角、是以市塲人心、均見穩站、各月份開價、較前週均好三五分、惟小麥業外賣買較稀、故成交未見大暢、迨至下午開盤、因上午粉市之　提、業中人心思、遂為激動、一時空頭暢補、投機客戶京有跟買、各月份又較上午漲五六分、各月份之漲度、最高均為一角一二分之巨、觀察後步、恐漲風尚未　也、現麥市面、特高貨亦提一角、計颕州山東麥五元四角、合肥麥五元二角、次一角九分、江北麥五元一角半、蕪湖麥五元一角七分、次五角零五分、又次五元、淮安麥五元二角半、次二角、洋河麥五元三角半、次三角二分、瑤灣麥五元二角九分、宿　麥五元一角半、高郵麥五元　角、南京麥五元一角、福新夫七千包、申大去五千包、</p>

<h3>客秈喊價步高</h3>
<p>昨日客秈新到不足萬包、而本街與汕粵去化均貪、統市成交二萬五千包以上、兼以產地被客囤吸收、出數漸稀、而河下米已見上升、洋麥又不合劃、因此貨主心思向上、喊價逐高、昨以本客暢辦、價乃激漲一二角、粵　繼續暢辦糙秈米、汕頭與本街則注重機米、北洋帮亦有少數洋米一千包成交、內地與浙帮亦稍有點綴、故市形轉俏、後市客化再旺、則市價或須步砌也、全日開出江西米一萬三千四百包、湖南米五千二百多包、沙漢糙米五千包、乍秈六百六十包、小絞一千包、</p>
<h3>北帮採辦種米</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源轉湧、共到有近五十號、貨共萬餘石、本街銷塲亦見活絡、且包胃有大連青島威海衛秦皇島烟台等帮辦　種一千餘包、及薄破二百餘包、故若　種百哥及新粳市况、雖到湧未見續跌、與呈平定之局、惟白粳以走化較遜、步低二尺、杜尖亦以供過於求、貶小角半、洋尖則無軒輊、厚薄破礱時將落令、銷路頓滯、故價再降一二角、陳變元貨稀無榮辱、新陰元平庸</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各貨到頭三十七八號、市上各色去胃早市平淡、午市轉佳、市形破粳高貨平定、中次帶緊角許、新粳高貨挺立、中次價加一角左右、新羊杜埠尖價略緊扣、薄稻變元客尖無榮辱、　中早疲晚緊、</p>

<h3>綠茶交易依然寥落</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊綠茶交易、依然寥落、英法各莊行家、因摩洛哥來電、認價過低、與現市茶價、未能符合、是以多持觀望態度、市勢尚存沉悶中、全市僅祇恊和等行、買進路莊珍眉針眉等綠茶、共計三百餘箱、售價較前又跌一二元、</p>
<h3>南北貨　厦橘餅來何遲也　—汕橘餅個大色佳—</h3>
<p>厦門橘餅、前因產區存貨軋缺、久乏到貨、號貨斷　多時、查昨日太原輪已有少數運到今日可以見樣、如果貨品紅亮、尚屬好銷、惜乎來貨過遲、否則倘在節前、尚可加價云、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （葉心佛）</p>
<p>你要是和中等學校學生常相接近的話，就覺得自瀆的情形，非常嚴重。他們正在發育强盛的時代，很多面色萎黃，精神不濟，頭暈耳鳴。對於功課，都抱及格主義，尤其是數學一科，成績大都平常，因腦髓的　喪，神經的衰弱，數學的題目最繁複，最費腦力，自然難于應付。所以歷年來物理化學機械上的發明，可說絕無僅有，便是仿傚亦不能。</p>
<p>自瀆者的體格，因為各部組織皆告疲乏，所以非常偷懶，勞動筋骨的勾當，往往怕做，對於運動不感興趣，像這次世運，中國一分都得不到，這顯而易見是　體力不濟，　喜歡運動的太少：世運的成績，真是察騐各國强弱的最公平的試金石。</p>
<p>青年到了生理成熟時期，不免有性的衝動，倘在這個嚴動時期，以相當的娛樂來調劑那就可以避免，這種娛樂，便是運動。因為在運動疲勞之後，性慾不期然而降低下去，自瀆的行為，自然可以避免了，倘在這個時候，各學校用盡方法，鼓勵提倡運動，一方面再灌輸性的衛生教育，那末便不難在下屆世運奪回幾個錦標，工業方面的仿造和發明，亦有相當的產生了。好嚴重的手淫，切莫忽視呀！</p>
<h3>頭髮的命運</h3>
<p>— 韓阿石</p>
<p>頭髮實在是個命途多舛者，在中古時代就看中了它，創下髠刑，就是將頭髮剃得一乾二凈，成個光頭。</p>
<p>髠刑廢除後，它總算茍全了若干年，和尚尼姑還是不算，直到清初，它就又不幸了，一律把束髮改作辮子，還要剃去。</p>
<p>到了清朝中季，洪楊起義，失去了一大半江山，他們的人民，是永不剃髮，所以呌長毛。在這時的人民，可真難極了，剃頭髮，遇見長毛是沒命，不剃頭髮，遇見清兵也是沒命，這時也會產生一度二道毛。</p>
<p>等到太平天國平了以後，全國又都一致人人腦後拖了一條豚尾，頭髮好像可以不再發生問題了。不打算到了清末，西洋風氣傳到中國，有心人知道，拖這條辮子是可恥的，然而國法又不容你剪去，雖是這樣那遭刦的動機已伏下了，武漢起義，義旗所至，第一就是剪辮子，到與已已經二十五個年頭，辮子總該剪完了，其實不然，那怕在前清作過一天芝蔴大的小官兒，掩掩藏總要保留頭頂上的一根小辮子，算是個遺老。還有窮鄉僻壤不見天日的老百姓，也留着一條豚尾，以為禮失而求諸野，古道尚在人間哩？</p>
<p>現在頭髮的花樣，便是除了女人，也就多極了，什麼分頭平頭和尚頭……總以為頭髮可以長此以往，不再發生問題，那知人事演進，它仍有討論的必要，如學生軍人都要剃光。最可笑的是去年夏天，江北上下河十幾縣，由新五師查保甲，發生謠言，說是留頭髮的，都有嫌疑，於是一傳十，十傳百，不上幾天，各地街上都是光光亮亮依樣葫蘆，其實何嘗有這回事呢？無非替理髮店添些生意罷了。</p>
<p>頭髮以後的命運，是不能預料，大約總不致十分冷淡，一樣會隨着時代變化而變化的。</p>
<h3>赤豆粽子</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>那似乎還在二十餘年前，在××浜一帶，已很馳名着『赤豆粽子』。赤豆粽子，是用赤豆和在糯米之中，裏着的粽子。但在××浜的赤豆粽子，却是物以人貴，人以物名的，說來倒也具有着相當的歷史。</p>
<p>說起這赤豆粽子的起原，或許已是遠在三十年前的事了。在×８浜的南岸上，住着一個可憐的寡婦，帶着三個孩子挨度着。因為無以為炊，於是糶了些赤豆豆糯米，裏賣着赤豆粽子。那時，這寡婦，還只有二十七八歲，姿容雖不美麗，但也相當的不惡。都時上海的風氣，還沒有現在那麼的放蕩，所以在市間，一旦發現了這麼個賣粽子的青年女子，便都紛紛地前往光顧。偏巧那寡婦的臉上，是有三顆紅痣的，於是大家便給伊提了個外號，就呌做『赤豆粽子』。</p>
<p>自從伊的外號，呌做赤豆粽子之後，她的赤豆粽子，便一天一天的馳名起來，生意也一天一天的好起來。過了五六年，伊把屋子裝修了一番，索性的開起點心店來了。但是最受顧客歡迎的，自然還是赤豆粽子，因為伊積着五六年的經騐，做起赤豆粽子來，確有一種特有的風味。雖然也有輕薄的顧客，是為了老闆娘有赤豆粽子之號，才去光顧，但大部份的顧客，却都是為了伊的粽子，具有着特有的風味。</p>
<p>二十餘年中，伊非但靠着裏售赤豆粽子，一家人足食暖衣，同時，還在裏面掙出了可觀的田地房屋若干。在數年前，伊的大兒子，小兒子，以及女婿，都在社會上，有了一些兒地位，於是逼着伊放棄這個點心店，以娛晚景·伊雖然有些兒不捨，但終以拗不過子媳婿女的求懇，才把那店盤掉了，安間地度着伊的老太太生活。但是知道伊的歷史的，見着伊時，總還有偷偷地在背地裏，呼之為『赤豆粽子』。</p>
<p>昨天，偶然因事行經伊的新宅門首，見伊家正在舉殯。仔細一瞧，某聞人題的『懿範長存』橫額之下的遺容下，顯然地排列着的三顆痣。這便不啻告訴着我，白手成家的赤豆粽子老太太，已騎鶴西去了。但是赤豆粽子的印象，是一世不會在我的腦筋中，磨滅的了。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第七回　手足情高匿函憐弱妹　詩書氣重窺影笑寒儒</p>
<p>夢蘭笑道：我怎麼是豈有此理了？友梅道：你自己說的話，含的是什麼用意，你當然知道，還用得着我細說嗎？你說這話，是什麼意思？難道……說到這裏，自己也紅了臉，把話突然的停止。好像是有一點笑容，要　了出來。可是他不等到那笑意露着，却又把嘴撅起來，鼓　腮幫子。夢蘭笑道：你對於我這句笑話，還放在心上嗎？友梅這才噗嗤一聲笑了。因道：那個把你的話放在心上，我不過同你鬧着玩罷了。而況你現在正是心裏難受的時候，我還要找你的錯處，那也於心不忍。夢蘭聽到，也只微笑了一笑，沒有說其他的話。彼此把話說到這裏，友梅到這裏來的原因就不能接着向下說了。閑談了一些別的話，他自告辭而去。不過這樣一來，夢蘭在心裏，却生了一種很大的感觸，覺得自己的命運萬萬不如友梅，他有那樣文明的家庭，有那樣自由的環境，而且還有那極康健的身體，自己却是把那一點去比他呢。為了這一點，心裏極端不舒適，仿彿又有一點病了。當日睡在樓上一天，也不曾和家裏打一個照面。依着自己的心境，是不願意到學堂裏去的。可是轉念到國器在這幾日之中，不能沒有信來。這信不寄到家裏來，當然就寄到了學校裏去。在三天五天之間，這信放在號房裏，不會出什麼事。若是日子太久了，却也怕信落別人手上去的。因之勉强掙扎着，又到學堂去了。說起來是一件極端矛盾的事。憑着夢蘭自己的表示，是不願同章國器有書信來往的。可是老不接着國器的信，心裏頭又像有一件事放不下，這教自己也　釋不過來，這是什麼理由。在他這盼望的時間，國器總算能不負他所望的，在每個星期裏，總有一封寄到夢蘭手上來，在這一情形下，另外還有一件奇事，便是他儘管來信，兩人在路上遇至的時候：只是遠遠的看上一眼，到了近處，還是低頭走了過去，在國器方面，夢蘭不知道他是什麼意思。在夢蘭自己，　覺得一個作女孩子的人，不能無故和一個陌生的人說話。民國九二年的時候，和現在雖只差二十年的距離，可是這在最近的中國，就仿彿隔了兩個世紀。那個時候的男女社交如何閉塞，今日二十歲附近的青年，他們並不相信。（八一）</p>
<p>短訊一　吳中名士蔣君仲川，任行營綆處長時，在河南洛陽漢光武陵　近旁民家，收集得光武陵墓磚十餘方，兩面有馬或鳳，或嘉禾，或武士，或文臣或斗方，圖案，各各不同，香古古色，名貴絕倫，現携歸陳列于蔣君手創之木瀆繡谷公墓大禮堂上，公開賞覽云。</p>

<h3>使命和死命</h3>
<p>— （陸國維）</p>
<p>聽說意國墨束里尼，負有恢復古代羅馬帝國光榮的使命。德國希特勒，負有必得歐戰前大德意志領土的使命，××人負有做東亞主人翁的使命…你也負有使命，我也負有使命，大家都負有使命。為了要達到自己的使命，便不惜拼命增加軍費擴張軍備，延長兵役，於是鬧得內使失業餓死的人數日日增加，外使二次大屠殺的危機一天迫近一天，唉！這種撈什子的『使命』，簡實是在預備致全人類的『死命』，有什麼別的可說呢！</p>
<h3>畫眉考始</h3>
<p>— 趙鐵帆</p>
<p>畫眉事，見於我國舊史者，當以前漢書張敞傳；『……又為婦畫眉，長安中傳張京兆眉撫……』，記載為最先，劉熙釋名；『黛代也，滅去眉毛，以代其處也。』解釋較為詳切，事文類聚；『漢宮人掃青黛蛾眉。』是可見畫眉之風，實遠肇西漢，劉熙訓黛為代，蓋亦本音同義近之意，如說文解字，訓天為顛，訓考為老之意。崔豹古今注；『魏宮人好畫長眉。』唐李義山無題詩；『長眉已能畫，』朱慶餘沂試上張水部詩；『畫眉深淺入時無，』可見畫眉之風，傳至魏唐，尚未衰熄，朱氏畫眉深淺之句，當係指黛色深淺而言，宋朱翌猗覺寮雜記：『今婦人削去眉毛，畫以墨，蓋古法也。』朱氏以為宋人用墨釋名以為漢人用黛，考楚辭；『粉白黛黑，』是可見黛亦係黑色，漢宋二代，採為畫眉用者，固無異也。自宋以降，關於畫眉之記載，雖不經見，然詩人用畫眉事者，則極為平凡，近代畫眉之風甚盛，亦可推見，宋以後畫眉之風，未嘗絕也。</p>
<h3>桄榔樹</h3>
<p>— 陳天賜</p>
<p>廣東有一種桄榔樹，（此樹產於熱帶地方），高有五六丈，葉是由多數小葉合成，幹的中心有紛，作赤黃色，可做餅餌。</p>
<p>但是粵俗多迷信，因為桄榔樹的枝幹直上而無枝節，據說可以象徵男子的一心一德。所以凡是女子有丈夫而有外遇的，必往桄榔樹前禱祀，（相傳此樹有神），且私以男子褲帶縛於樹幹，如此則男子可以一心與要女的白頭偕老云。</p>
<p>因之廣東的每一棵桄榔樹，時常能見到許多香腳，咒文，紙人等的禱祀品，貼滿樹腳。</p>
<h3>秋蟲雜談</h3>
<p>— 成軒</p>
<p>『以蟲鳴秋』的季節，又輪流到了！的確，不論在早上，或是晚間，在都市，或者鄉村，隨處可以聽到秋蟲唱着的以大自然為譜的曲調，然而被傷感的人們聽了，非但不去享受這歌曲的美妙，而反觸起了他的愁思，像六一居士歐陽修秋聲賦中『但聞四壁蟲聲啷啷，如助予之嘆息』一般！</p>
<p>在秋蟲中，蟋蟀，最是受人的青睞，雖然秋暗，蛣蛉子，也有一部人去捧它。所以談到秋蟲，歷來的文人學士，把蟋蟀來引起他們的文興和詩意，不知多多少少。的確，蟋蟀怪有趣的，它啷啷翟翟的鳴聲，不像別的秋蟲，却可以利用來作寒暑表，它好像是鳥類中的燕子，知時的候鳥，預告着氣候的變遷，這因為它的一舉一動，跟氣候溫度變轉的關係，在五月裏，它只能跳躍，六月則能飛鳴，到了八月，因了寒氣的侵襲，進攻，為自衛計便從草野中，移到墻腳下，到了十月，便到床下來求生存，記得從前有個着名的氣象學家勃羅克氏，說蟋蟀最活躍的時期，是從夏天仲秋，在華氏寒暑表十五度時，是蟋蟀鳴聲最低的極限，勃羅克了再說，在華氏七十九，每分鐘呌聲一百八十三回，溫度下降，鳴聲也跟着下降，直到溫度的極限外止，所以依它的鳴聲，可以做寒暑表，並且十分的的真確無誤！而且假使它的鳴聲比平時清晰的話，可以知道有暴風雨來的朕兆呢！談到中蟋蟀，便覺得它鳴聲的偉大，真不是平常一般的秋蟲，所能比擬呢！</p>
<h3>讓他多睡一會罷！</h3>
<p>— 張皇</p>
<p>一清早的聲響這麼大！</p>
<p>不是大哭小喊，便是老媽做活，東手碰來西腳帶。</p>
<p>輕揭帳門瞧他有給驚醒麼？</p>
<p>掩進房來，一埭又一埭。</p>
<p>回頭暗罵一聲：</p>
<p>『不知那一世裏欠下你們的債？』</p>
<p>想他連年吃苦精神壞，怎經得，老是睡得少來醒得快？</p>
<p>多謝你們讓他多睡一會罷！</p>
<p>望他身體康强，我願為他一日拜到夜。</p>

<h3>醫學檢騐</h3>
<p>— 姚星叔</p>
<p>醫學檢騐，漸漸引起社會的注意了。病人需要檢騐，不生病的人也要檢騐，呌做健康檢騐；一個人去受檢騐之外，又有什麽集團檢騐。不論怎樣的說，醫學檢騐的效能，似乎有入在那兒天天把他提高。雖然這與檢騐本身價値是漠不相關的。</p>
<p>平日默察一般人對於檢騐的觀感有兩種：一對於檢騐過分相信，跡近迷信，一對於檢騐不相信，未免固執。兩種相反的態度，却犯了過猶不及的毛病。</p>
<p>大家總該曉得了，新醫診病，有視診，觸診，打診，聽診的法子，這是利用天賦的五官能力，在病人身上下些探索的工夫，用他來帮助診斷，以便利於治療的處置。方法簡單，甚切實用，不可謂非醫學檢騐的濫觴。然而五官的力量有限，有時不夥滿足我們的需要，也是事實。</p>
<p>醫學天天進步，同時其他科學日見昌明，於是醫學檢騐的方法，隨之日趨復雜。可分他為三種：一，生物學的檢騐，各種細菌，微生物檢查，血液反應等屬之；二，理學的檢查，血壓測定，愛克司光透視等屬之，三，化學的檢查，檢查糖質，蛋白質，胃液等屬之。這些儘管器械精良，方法緻密，有不可吾認的價値；但那視做醫學檢騐濫觴的視觸打聽四法，依然保持着倨傲的姿態。凡是純正的醫家都知道，一對黑眼睛，兩片肉耳朶，玉手一雙在病狀上有所獲得，加以我們是考的經騐，時亦大可補助機械化的試驗管，顯微鏡，愛克司光等等之不足。</p>
<p>我們要明白，一切的檢騐在醫療上不過居輔助的地位，僅僅乎有益於診斷與治療罷了。迷信他的人，把輔助看成獨辦，未免使檢騐受寵若驚；不相信他的人，把輔助的價値，看得一文不値，可太委屈他了。原來檢騐所得的結果，可以表示事實的一部，不能及於事實的全體，不該看做是每個病人的全部報告</p>
<p>比方說，生肺癆病的人，痰內可以檢出癆菌：瀝白濁的人，分泌物內可以騐得淋菌。騐出了，鐵證如山，所患確為肺癆，白濁無疑，檢騐不就够人相信了。但檢騐不出，亦事所常有，我們祇可說痰內未見癆菌，分泌物內未見淋菌，可不能說此人並無此病，因此檢騐又够人不相信了。又如梅毒有無，普通人多已知道去騐血解决，但梅毒患者在特種情形之下，血的反應，竟可騐他不出；這不是說他不患梅毒。瘧疾發作時，的確血內可以騐得瘧蟲，但儘也有許多病人騐不出的，我們還得把他看做虐疾。歸總一句話，一切的檢騐，如某騐不出什麽出來，不足為絕對無此病之表示。</p>
<p>話要說回頭，假使檢騐竟有什麽騐出，似乎可靠了，然而在有經騐的醫生，可不是這樣看法，還得要與全部症狀對照，仔細的研究一番，然後才下診斷。此乃醫生之事，在此不必多說。</p>
<p>總之，醫學檢騐的結果，要受諸種環境的影響，例如一個人生閉鎖性肺癆（卽肺病的部分不與氣管枝交通的肺癆），痰內不容易發現癆菌：梅毒患者受了不完全的驅梅療法，血液梅毒反應就可不表現出來。此外擔任檢騐工作人的人，其技術，其性情如何，在在與檢騐的結果相關。因此，騐不出什麽，除去事實上的困難外，有時要負疏忽的責任；騐出什麽來了，有時又負正確的責任。雖然這兩種責任，在法律上並不成問題；這更可看得出檢騐是所佔的位置了。</p>

<p>（三）利用保甲—照上所述；單靠連絡舊醫來推進新醫藥衛生，而散砂似的農民，從來沒有受過他入的管束，更沒有挨過別人的壓制，緣此而養成沒有團結力，沒有組織的習慣，更沒有一致的心，而想跑到人地生疎，散砂般的組織起來的農村上，辦理一伴完美的事情，眞是一件不輕易舉的事啊！在上半年，政府有鑒及此，感覺農民的精神太散漫，太無組織，舉辦保甲訓練，同時被推為保甲長的人又是農民中的優秀人物；加之又受過多時的正當訓練，有事和他們接洽，要比一般無知的農民好得多，因為他們是他們（農民）中的首腦，大小事都要他們來過問；所以要新醫藥衛生的推行，必先設法和他們合作，無異於一般的農民服從我們，又省却了許多的麻煩，同時在簡單中收到美滿的效果：</p>
<p>（四）要使政府與人民合作——要普及農村新醫藥衛生，單靠少許的力量是不能够的。所以要政府與人民合作，一方面籍政府的財力和勢力，來推進這種工作：一方面要靠民衆們自動的組織起來，能够接受這種工作，務求上下一致，充分合作，共謀這種事業的進行。然後這種組織工作始能奏效而持久；並且新醫藥衛生有自動推行的希望。</p>
<p>（五）要設立施診所——要在農中心處所設立施診所，因有一點醫療救濟的施給，而引起被醫療救濟的地方一般農民對於「農村醫藥衛生機關的好戚」。這一點的效果，姑且不論他對於農村醫藥衛牛治療機有沒有相當的成效；同時在他們來就診時，可以利用些圖畫，標語，或將些普通所常患的疾病護理的常識，病前的預防，病後的處置，以及日常生活的衛生，灌輸給他們，使他們認識新醫藥的技術與價値，知道衛生與不衛生利害的關係。這樣不但對於新醫藥建有鞏固的基礎，實為普及農村醫藥衛生的極大帮助。</p>
<p>（六）訓練人員——雖有健全的組織，設置的完備，沒有相當的工作人員，也就是一件美中不足的事，換言之，推進農村醫藥衛生地個基本困難；所以確定了目標，就要訓練工作人員，依照所規定的組織，可以知道需要那幾種人材，然後根據這種需要去訓練這種人材，使供與求有切實相符，人材的應用也可以妥適了。但是訓練工作技術方面應充分以科學的醫學的方法及學識為根據外，尤黨以特別注意人格的培養，這是一件普通訓練工作人員所最容易忽略的事，關於人格的訓練，應注意下列的幾點，</p>
<p>（一）培植「以服務為目的」底精神。（二）訓練儉樸的生活；務求工作人員的生活，須能與當地一般的人民生活差不多，使農民見了不要發生「懸殊」之感；如生活程度能减低，薪給自然不會求高，每月祗有三十至四十元左右，當能滿足。（三）待人接物須「至誠」，處事要「忠實」！（四）决對糾正苟且，重表面，懶情，不求進步，敷衍，欺驪等不良的習慣。</p>
<p>最後還有一點意見，貢獻給現在從事農村醫藥衛生的工作人員，像這種工作使能整個的社會可以一齊推行，這是非常重要的事。同事關於復興農村的事業，由推進農村醫藥衛生着手，而奠定農村復興的基礎；不過，將來推進的程度，要看我們有沒有整個的目標，健全的組織和努力謹愼去幹，完成這個農村的使命，不但對於農民有所保障，就是對於農村復興的工作也有很大的帮助。</p>
<p>（一）改良敎育——農民僻居深鄉，距城甚遠，敎育的制度仍是古舊法，讀的還是古書，至於什麼中學敎育，高等敎育，就是連初級敎育也沒有享受的機會：人民知識不開，醫藥衛生固然不易推行。所以希望辦理農村醫藥衛生的先覺者和敎育界的領袖，來竭力推行新的敎育，共謀農村的新敎育的普及和改良；可將衛生一課，列為基本課程因為衛生敎育是有關民族生存的根本敎育，可以用淺近的文字，疾病的原因，患病的預防，以及新醫藥衛生之益處，急救的療法，求神問卜，一些不可靠的學識來灌輸給他們，使他們在幻小的時侯；種下了减單的醫藥知識，衛生的觀念；已年大的，敎些新的科學常識，新生活的習慣，以開闢他們的茅塞，這樣不數年後，就可造成一個新的農村了，同時對於新醫藥衛生的推行，佔有沒大的協助。</p>
<p>（二）連絡舊醫——農民不能得到新敎育的培植，更不能得到新醫藥的享受，除得求神問卜之外，比較稍具知識或家境富裕的人們，完全採用舊醫，深信舊醫，絲毫沒有新醫的影響和槪念：因此一般的腐舊醫？往往勸人家包醫，所用之藥大都是些昇藥降藥，或是些對症下藥，敷衍了事。所以一般無知的農民，蒙其流毒，以為包治醫生方可盡心診治，多用好藥，這是一般農民的錯誤觀念；所謂醫生有悲天憫人的心腸，豈有不悉心診治之理。而且新醫無包治之理，同時包醫又被法律所禁止，加以農民性多頑癖，誠為新醫推行前途的一大阻礙物；所以要新醫藥衛生推行，前途無阻，極應連絡舊醫，站在一條戰錢上，合作研究，共謀新醫藥衛生的普及推行。（完）</p>

<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（九十二）痛風（下）</p>
<p>痛風病的豫後，吉凶如何？</p>
<p>若能行合理療法，可以全愈，若合併腎臟心臟病的時候或起尿毒症或甚至中風，那就危險。診斷痛風，容易不容易？</p>
<p>痛風發作時診斷自是容易，可是應該和急性風濕痺相區別。平常則和慢性多發性關節炎或變形性關節炎相區別痛風症應該怎樣療治？</p>
<p>療治痛風要從食品療養，藥物療治和物理療治三方面進行。</p>
<p>食品療養是怎樣的？</p>
<p>食品首宜禁制食肉和飲酒。可多食植物性食品如水果菜蔬之類。乳汁咖啡鷄蛋，茶，鑛泉果汁都可儘量使用。藥物療治是怎樣的？</p>
<p>內服阿托方最為有效或用阿托方尼爾注射。此外用柳酸黨劑的內服也行。鎭痛劑只許暫用。物理療治是怎樣的？</p>
<p>為促進新陳代謝起見，宜常行運動，溫浴等。在急性發作時，將關節包裹，安靜臥床等到炎飛消退後再行操作。</p>
<h3>浙江硖石衛生狀况調查報告（三）</h3>
<p>— 沈松年</p>
<p>公共娛樂塲所，最高尙者為民敎館，其决審山麓之公共體育塲，再决為硤石戲院，現正在開演京劇。紫薇山麓鐵路勞之硤西公園，因管理不善，早已腐敗不堪：倒不如橫港橋外沈氏花園，亭臺花卉精彩，樹竹葱籠，風景淸幽，內有名產如水蜜桃，白蘭花等早已名聞遐邇，園內各處頗整潔，最適為公共遊息塲所，惜為私家花園，絕少開放，普通民衆不能一飽眼福。</p>
<p>（七）慈善機關</p>
<p>硤鎭慈善機關稍具規樓者為育嬰所，貧兒院，貧民習藝所，樓留所等，其他各業曁各善士所設立者不下十餘名稱，惜常因經費支絀，不易盡量發展。</p>
<p>（八）出產藥物</p>
<p>此地無特出藥物，所產藥品，亦不能作為正式醫用，因農田以蠶荳稻麥，為大宗，無正式播種藥物者。唯無人耕種之地，如山地等處所產之藥品名稱甚多，茲述其要者如下：荆芥，半蒡子，桃仁，除虫菊，野菊花，海金沙，地骨皮，薄荷，藿香，枇杷葉，杏仁，香櫞等。</p>
<p>（九）小規模工廠</p>
<p>硤鎭無大規模工廠，電燈公司可執硤鎭工廠之牛耳，其决為康泰，泰隆，泰豐，萬有餘等十餘家碾米廠，工人江北人居多，蓋江北人能耐勞苦，忠於職守，工資比較微薄，故各廠家咸樂意僱用。至衛生設備方面，有待改進之處甚多。</p>
<p>（十）地方病</p>
<p>殎石無特殊地方病，唯脚蛀（俗名香港脚）一症甚普遍，自國產「民生」必治愈油膏出，民衆都能自己醫治，故這　「必治愈」銷路大暢。</p>
<p>（十一）流行病</p>
<p>這裏法定急性傳染病除百斯篤絶對未曾流行外餘如霍亂，腦脊髓膜炎等均流行過，唯不甚劇，這不得不歸功於當局曁醫療機關防治之嚴密。</p>

<p>（甲）戒烟所</p>
<p>區立戒烟所於去年十月間奉令開辦，所長爲硤石公安局長陳育人氏，副爲區長吳觀瀾氏兼任，醫師二，縣派醫師一，助理醫師一，幹事二，工役二，其戒烟法採取發泡法及嗎啡减癮法，成績卓著，頗得上峰嘉許，特派員吳望級氏曾讚曰：爲附近各縣中成效最佳者，曾戒絶出所者不下三百餘名。其所需經費爲每月三百元，經費來源大部分係由當地士紳募集。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼疾病衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（一〇二）何謂夜盲症及晝盲症</p>
<p>我們的眼睛。是有一種辨別明暗的機能。這種機能。在醫學上稱為光覺。在網膜視細胞中的桿狀體。專司光覺。至於圓錐體。則司視力與色覺。網膜的中心部。多圓錐體。邊緣部少桿狀體。所以我們感覺弱光的機能。當以邊緣部為最强。再有所謂暗適應者。就是我們從戶外進入暗室的時候。室內一切物體常不得見。須經片刻時間。而與暗處適合後。方可明瞭認識室內一切物體。反之。久居暗室後。突然走出戶外的時候。卽感目眩。但是不久卽可與之適合。回復原有普通的狀態。這種情形。稱為明適應。</p>
<p>光覺如果减弱。或者暗適應發生障礙。在醫學上。特稱之為夜盲症。簡言之。就是畫間的視力。雖與常人無異。然至黃昏的時候。或在光綫不足的地方。則視力卽可極端减退。所以俗間特有雀目及鷄盲等名（此因雀與鷄的眼睛。亦係暮暗朝明。）</p>
<p>夜盲症有先天性及後天性的兩種。後天性夜盲症中。則又分為特發性夜盲症及由網膜的器質變化而起的兩種。</p>
<p>（一）先天性夜盲症——譬如在小口氏病及白點狀網膜炎等時。常可發生。小口氏病乃係日人小口忠太氏所發見。是一種先天性網膜異常。幼時卽訴夜盲。白點狀網膜炎。是網膜外層的一種先天性變性。在網膜面上。發生散在性的小白點。自覺症候中。常訴夜盲。</p>
<p>（二）特發性夜盲症——此病槪因營養不良。缺乏甲種維他命（VitaminA）而起。屢伴結膜乾燥病。貧兒居多。夏秋易發。身體常瘦弱。俗間所謂雀目疳眼者。卽指本症而言。患者的視力。於畫間雖覺正常。但至薄暮。卽吿不能察兒物體。本症宜多進滋養物。內服魚肝油。當有奇效。我國古方對於雀目疳眼。亦多賞用鷄肝，猪肝，牛肝，及羊肝。據云確有著效。所以肝臟對於本症。確已早有著明的治療價値。</p>
<p>（三）因網膜變性或萎縮而發夜盲症——例如在網膜色素變性及先天性梅毒性網膜脈絡膜萎縮等時。常可發生。網膜色素變性是一種遺傳性疾患。血族結婚的子孫。每易遭罹。同時常有全身發育不全，聾啞，或內分泌異常。通常兩眼併發。它的主訴。就是夜盲。有先天性梅毒性網膜脈絡膜萎縮的患者。於幼時卽覺夜盲。</p>
<p>盡盲症適與夜盲症相反。就是患者在强光下。反覺視力减退。若在稍暗處。則視力卽可轉佳。此在軸性視神經炎及全色盲等時。屢可遇見。</p>

<h3>勞工飲食調查</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>勞工的生活是最苦的，我們用「牛馬生活」四字作比喩，可說再恰當也沒有。他們日夜辛辛勞勞，出賣血汗，所得到的代價，很是微薄，幾乎不足以維持起碼的生活。別的不提，單就飲食一項而言，不受飢餓，已算幸事，那里還說得上營養？</p>
<p>近據中華醫學會的報吿，就上海七家工廠及其員工曁家庭的勞工飲食，加以調查，結果發現童工的飲食，質與量兩方面，都在標準需要限度之下，並較其他各種工人的飲食，更為不如，又勞工的飲食中，炭水化合物過多，所含的獸類脂肪和獸類蛋白質，均嫌不足，且質地不佳，顯見營養不良。</p>
<p>人們說，「勞工是神聖」，這話當然不錯。但我們一見勞工的生活狀况，便不免要寒心。勞工的工作，貢獻不能不算大，而過的是苦生活，或者比牛馬還不如。牛馬能望一飽，勞工却求不到最低度的飲食。尤其是童工，正在發育中，飲食更此其他工人為壞。這直接可以影響勞工的健康，間接可以影響工作的效能。</p>
<p>邇來我們常聞有人主張「保障勞工」，惟要保障勞工，首要應改善勞工的生活。這里所說的改善，並不奢望舒適，祇求其不凍餒。但僅僅這要求，恐就很難以達到。資方正時時在想盡法子，作無厭的剝削。他們只見自己的利益，顧不到勞工的死活。</p>
<p>中華醫學會的調查報告，是注重在勞工的飲食方面，這有關於生理衛生，足資醫學上的研究，但同時也可作為關心勞工生活者的參考。惟勞工的生活，值得注重的地方很多，若能從各方面，加以調查，這對於勞工生活的改蕃，當有不少的帮助。</p>
<h3>出征</h3>
<p>— 芷夫</p>
<p>——舊史新編——</p>
<p>連接括了三天的北風，把一大隊的軍馬全阻住在花家村地方，要等那暴風靜止了，扌能拔營登程呢。</p>
<p>這次，營部是預備開發到黑水頭一帶去駐紮的。當軍隊未曾出發的前一天，營裏派遣了不少兵卒，到各處徵寡隨行的壯丁，甚至還下鄉去挨戶催吿的。</p>
<p>木蘭——花家村裏一位年靑的女子，這天她常戶閒坐着，眉心鎖得緊緊地，好像心裏有什麽難事要待解决似的，不息底長嘆着。</p>
<p>周遭的空氣很是靜寂。忽然，有一陳馬鈐的聲音從遠而近，接着，有人來扣她的門了。</p>
<p>「那一位啊？」她向外問道。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>「我們是軍營中來下書的。」一張怪粗噪的喉口在門外回答。</p>
<p>木蘭便毫不疑惑地把大門啟了開來，她一眼就瞧見那個粗眉的漢子把手要的軍帖遞進來。神氣顯得非常的侷促。</p>
<p>「明天中午，大隊就要啟程了。你們花老頭兒也得去歸隊啊！如果他老邁了，應該你的兄弟們，準時去集合，不可有誤卯期哪！」那個兵卒說了幾句話，急促地跨上了馬鞍，向山坡那邊飛一般地馳去了。</p>
<p>「唉！」木蘭回頭又嘆息了一下，像有所感慨似的，隨卽返身跑進了門。裏邊她的爸媽，從臥房裏一蹺一拐地走出來。</p>
<p>「木蘭啊！是那一位來了哦？」</p>
<p>「是軍隊裏人來的，」她邊把那木軍帖呈給爸瞧。</p>
<p>媽媽驚異地用着慌張的眼光，向老頭子震顫的手腕望着，眼眶幾乎紅得快要發腫了。</p>
<p>「爸啊！剛才那漢子說的要我們準備去歸隊，我想你老人家不必着急，這是為了我們整個的國土！在此存亡的關頭，本來人民應當負起各人的任務。現在我决意喬裝着花家的壯丁，去隨跟大軍出征去……」</p>
<p>滿臉激昻地說着，二條柳似的垂眉，豎了起來，頰上更透出了一片鮮明的紅霞。</p>
<p>「你，你發瘋了啦！難道女兒家……」媽媽更顯得驚慌了，哭傷着臉子竭力地阻止她。</p>
<p>「……誰說女兒家不能負起偉大的使命來呢！眞的木蘭决然起來。</p>
<p>「軍中歹人多啊！你……」爸爸也幾乎哭了起來：……喉嚨像哽住了一塊鐵餅似的。</p>
<p>木蘭却是忖劃着出征的行裝。她又偸偸的跑出了家門，到市上去選了一匹挺壯的白駒，和那些弓矛，鞍轡……帶了回來。</p>
<p>又經過了半天精細的改裝，木蘭從臥房里出來，已儼然變了個勇武的男漢，她的弟弟望着她，猛的狂喊了起來：</p>
<p>「啊！姊姊可變相了！竟是我的哥哥了啊！」</p>
<p>就是爸和媽呢，這時候也分辨不出來了。他用着昏花的老眼瞧住她，突然失笑起來。然而一想到心愛的女兒卽刻就要離開了自己的身懷，心頭一股酸味湧上來，兩注飽盈的老淚滾到了唇邊。</p>
<p>「爸啊！心痛什麼呢？……」木蘭豪爽地道。</p>
<p>「我的一家人好好兒在的，為什麽要……這麽分散啊……呃！……」爸媽抱着她的臂膀，號啕地大哭了。</p>
<p>「說的什麼啊！如今我們的國土快將淪亡了，我們還有什麽家。我們要盡我們的力量，去驅逐了那些胡兒，待女兒帶了血腥的利劍來，那時再建立我們的神聖融和的家庭吧。……」</p>
<p>木蘭竭力掙脫了爸媽的擁抱。</p>
<p>老年的兩顆苦澀的心，也被說得把哭聲收住了。一邊，慌忙地預備替女兒收拾殘零的行裝。</p>
<p>慕氣沉重地壓了下來，村莊的原野全籠上了一層黑暗，風，似乎也止住了。遠處嘹饗地傳來了一陣　哨的聲音，營火照得山坡也通紅的。就在這個夜晚的時光，木蘭終於頭也不回地跨上馬鞍疾馳地遠去了。……</p>
<p>爸媽倚靠在自己的家門邊，含着淚，目送着他那長途遠征的心愛的女兒。</p>
<h3>風</h3>
<p>— 鄭明子</p>
<p>風寒冷地，飄拂地吹着。</p>
<p>田野裏開始變得荒凉起來：稻桿子全發黃了，葉子疏疏地離開枯萎的枝條，落到泥地上，給路人殘路淸，這樣，便慢慢地腐爛在泥土裏，消失掉了。誰也不再記得牠們，誰也不再記得夏日的濃蔭！而今，那些樹枝是禿裸的，夜晚廣塲上也不再有人談笑，四野裏漸漸地變得蕭條起來：是秋天了。</p>
<p>風吹着吹着，把原野吹得不個個樣子了：當凋零的季節來到的時候，什麼也不能幸免牠底衰亡。樹枝漸漸地變得赤裸而枯萎，連長在石縫邊的三兩片小小的草葉，也一樣的萎黃起來了……</p>
<p>正如金家鎭上的馬老婆子想不透年來這「世界的僻鄉」所遭到的艱苦的命運一樣：「這到底是怎麽一回事，到底是遭到了什麽惡風呢？……」</p>
<p>馬老婆子一家住到金家村來，據她自己撥着指頭仔細的算起來，少說些也有上八十來年了。據說，她給祖上帶到這裏來，是在「長毛」造反的時候，那時馬老婆子祇還是一個六個月的嬰兒。</p>
<p>一家人在這裏住下，勞作，繁息，日子便那樣地過去了，老年的人一代代地死去，躺在他們底血汗所灌溉過的泥十裏，而現在是—照算起來，馬老婆子該連曾孫也有了，而且不久，也許會跟着一代代的先人躺在泥裏的—然而，現在馬老婆子是什麽也沒有，近五十歲的那個她惟一的兒子，也在貧困與憂急中磨壞了性情，每天喝下了酒，便再也不會用好聲氣來對待她了。「臨死的人了，還要過那種日子！造孽囉，造孽囉，遭到了什麽惡風呢…？」</p>
<p>眞像是遭到了什麽「惡風，」這日子，活了七十多歲的馬老婆子，是從來沒有過到過的。以前—就說五年以前，日子多少還好過的多。兒子在上海的一家紗廠裏做工，那一年做了「上手，」加了五塊錢的工錢，年上回家的時候，還帶了一個年紀輕輕的女人來，趕着馬老婆子呌婆婆……</p>
<p>這一回，馬老婆子可笑開了心，兒子加了工錢，還多了一個媳婦，一家子高高興興的。日子是一天天地在好起來，眞的，就像是太平世界了。</p>
<p>這小小的金家村像隔絕了醜惡世界的桃源，生活是平易的，日子是輕快的……</p>
<p>可是就在第二個年底，還沒到回家過年的日子，在上海做工的兒子媳婦都趕回來了；說是××人打上海，廠裏停了工，而上海也慌起來了。</p>
<p>然而「上海，」好像是遠得很啊，馬老婆子也時常聽她兒子說起「上海，」那是個好地方，該是和那個僻小的金家村沒有什麽大關係的。</p>
<p>可是，接連四個月下來，他們也着急起來了。金家村裏漢子們在上海做工的也不止一家，可是在家裏坐吃，全有點支不住了，到第五個月急急到上海去看一看：好多的店廠都不再開了，就有開的，也把工錢减了好多。就說馬老婆子的兒子，到開工後三個月又回到了鄉裏來，說是廠關了門，這一回是沒有事情好做，得在家裏呆起了。</p>
<p>這樣，日子一天天的艱難起來，無辦法起來了，失了業，一切都不順手，再找工做是比登天還難，馬老婆子的兒子天天把自己浸在酒要，喝醉了回來駡老娘，打女人。女人受不了磨折，第三年上也就悄悄地溜走了，剩下金家村上那些沒法的人，過着野狗一樣的殘生：飢餓，貧窮，與悲慘……</p>
<p>「是什麽惡風啊！」馬老婆子依然想不懂：然而，世界的確是落在凋零的季節裏了……</p>
<h3>小主人</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>老拉克與蕊莎</h3>
<p>— 林娜</p>
<p>拉克從王城內趕馬車回來。他坐在車臺上，微閉着眼，嘴角咬住一把煙斗，現着深思的樣子。在他背後，那揚着灰塵的一長列棕櫚樹林里，就映出了黃昏的晚霞。</p>
<p>老頭子很沉悶，他正想起了家。在家里三年前還有老婆，兩個兒子和女兒，三年後的現在，情形就變了，老婆子死了，兩個兒子參加了丹牛蘭（農民暴力政黨）暴動，一個被判處了永久的徒刑，一個在流亡着，現在家里剩下的，就只有這老頭子，和十八九歲的一個女兒。照一般菲律濱士人底習慣，她可以自由地和人家戀愛或結婚了，而他底終身也就有了依靠，女兒和女婿要擔負起看養他老境的義務的，雖然，他自信筋骨還很結實還可從小市鎮里把士產運載上岷里拉去，又可以把岷里拉的洋貨趕回鄕下山店舖里去。</p>
<p>但是，女兒却從小就生就那麽膽小，沒决斷。她是在園主人底椰子林裏長大起來的，她沒有一般女孩子底好動和頑皮。有許多和她同等年紀的，已突起肚皮在走路，而她却連一個情人也沒有找着。有一回她被追逐者底情歌從椰林里趕出來，面紅耳赤的躱在屋子里流淚；有一回，她用整盆的冷水，澆在窗底下向她求愛的年靑歌唱者身上。為的只是她害怕，害怕那些男人，和從他們底喉嚨里發出淫猥的歌聲。</p>
<p>這使這年老的父親很焦急，他相信她將永遠得不到情人的，因為村里的年靑人已害怕和她接近了。（未完）</p>

<p>調虎離山計最良。笑唐實一味假裝腔。說枝山勾引我吳中去。我是。為受深恩莫敢行。相公聽。怒非常。恨狂生作事太荒唐。你不過一個儒士輩。那裏有。金釵十二列兩行。非是我今朝誇大口。靑衣中儘有美紅妝。命僮兒揀選也何妨。忙喚管家老婆子。傳齊合府衆梅香。待雀屛中選便成雙。好事多磨從古說。穠桃艷李各呈方。惟有花王不出堂。莫非是。此時常未巧梳裝。且把凡花隨意選。評量瘦燕與肥楊。連選數人天已暮。無情無緒意皇皇。鴻山看出書僮意。進房廳夫婦共商量。夫人出對試僮郞。說道好待紅蓮迎夏雨。那知他。欲攀丹桂領秋香。此童眼力果然强。一個石榴心着急。穩瓶打碎拍浪蕩。閉房哭死又還陽。</p>

<p>開篇「林處士」</p>
<p>湖上孤山一角靑。梅花三百種成林。好一個，天懷澹遠林君復。竹籬茅舍自甘心。不受塵埃半點侵。豈但好學未嘗求仕進。而且廿年足趾未臨城。梅是作妻小子鶴。可知鐵心傲骨本天成。天寒有鶴梅花守。彷彿萱實承歡還有母子情。梅頩頰。鶴嗚陰。一個是，姑射仙人工笑　。一個是，輕淸雛鳳讀書聲。偶遊山寺佳賓至。他奚奴縱鳳入靑雲。只見對舞蹁　把家主迎。先生是，小艇瓜皮歸路遠。勝陶家稚子候柴門。工書畫。愛詠吟。說我無須名世稿休存。然而疏影橫斜水淸淺。暗香浮動月黃昏。已經佳句傳流直到今。厥後君王頒粟帛。還易名和靖號先生。高潔獨留身後名。說茂陵他日求遺稿。幸喜會無封禪文更可見，風流放浪早薄長卿。</p>

<p>香蓮碧水動風凉。水動風凉夏日長。長日夏。碧蓮香。鶯鶯小姐喚紅娘。與你香閨閒無事。後園中消悶散心腸。紅娘聽。意洋洋。隨千金移步下樓房。轉灣曲折身向內。竹屛風穿過木香棚。行至白梅亭上站。則見森森遮太陽。好一個伶俐小紅娘。急忙推開四面窗。桌兒擺中央。遙琴去了囊。寳鼎爐中焚了香。千金坐下按工任。先彈一曲湘妃怨。又彈一曲鳳求凰。數曲遙琴方已畢。見金烏漸漸落西方。紅娘忙碌亂。閉上四面窗。遙琴掛在墻。寳鼎爐中熄烟香。雙雙主婢轉閨房。打從原路行前去。小橋曲折映池塘。見池中戲宿兩鴛鴦。丫頭吓，早日夏凉風動水。水動風凉夏日凉。固然美景不尋常。</p>

<h3>大上海將映「女王殉國」</h3>
<p>大上海大戲院將於國慶日前後，公映雷電華偉大宮闈巨片「女王殉國」。該片係凱絲琳赫本及茀德立馬區主演，的翰福特氏導演。內述蘇格蘭皇后瑪麗一生可歌可泣之事蹟。瑪麗冲齡蒙難，流居法國，及長，許與法王為后，惟不旋踵法王猝崩，於是乃浩然有歸志。英女王伊麗莎伯間訊，多方阻撓，惟瑪麗終於一葉孤舟，安抵故土。歸國後，羣臣反側，骨肉參商，幸得識包司惠爾伯爵輸誠輸忠，芳心乃得稍慰。惟後以政治作用，乃不得不下嫁唐萊公爵。時羣臣藉英后之力，陰謀變亂，瑪麗之秘書里齊亞被刺，唐萊公爵蒙難身亡。瑪麗於是乃與包司惠爾伯爵結褵，惟以圍城日急，不得已與反臣訂盟，與伯爵生別，後始受騙，被迫傳位於太子，以皇后之尊，淪為階下之囚。獄中設法求助伊麗莎伯，得以安抵英國。滿以為光明重覩，後此可逍遙歲月。不意英后叵測，又下瑪麗於獄，且以謀圖英后生命之大逆罪，處瑪麗於死。定讞之日，瑪麗初猶痛責英后詭謀，尋知包司惠爾伯爵已斃於流所，因思孑然一身，更無獨存之趣，於是萬念俱釋，從容就義。片中之悲歡離合，實極盪氣廻腸之概。海上人士，尙希勿將此超凡入聖歷史宮闈巨片交臂失之。</p>

<h3>Guangdong Officials Sworn Into Office in Large Numbers</h3>

Tang stated that the Guangdong Salt Affairs Audit Office would be merged with the Salt Transport Department and reorganized into the Guangdong and Guangxi Salt Affairs Administration.

<h3>Sino-Japanese Diplomacy: Negotiations to Continue This Week; Kawagoe Visit Appointment Pending; Hirota Believes Negotiations Can Be Resolved; Military Believes Future Prospects Are Dim</h3>
<p>Japanese Foreign Ministry Denies British Government's Reproach</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe plans to visit Foreign Minister Zhang within this week to continue negotiations on Sino-Japanese diplomacy. The time will be determined ad hoc. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Prime Minister Hirota went to Hokkaido to inspect the army's grand exercises. While passing through Aomori, he gave local journalists the impression that Hirota believed that the negotiations with China could ultimately achieve a satisfactory resolution. As Foreign Minister, Hirota strongly advocated Sino-Japanese friendship, and the current negotiations are the final test of this policy. Therefore, Hirota believes that the success or failure of the negotiations will have a significant impact on the future of both countries. The press has learned that the current negotiations are essentially the same as the previous ones, but Japan is now going further to guarantee that it has no territorial ambitions, so that China can accept them without any worries. The press also believes that the Prime Minister also has a belief that after the principle of negotiation and progress is established, a Sino-Japanese committee should be established to discuss specific strategies. However, at the same time, the heads of the Army General Staff Headquarters in Sapporo expressed very little hope for the future of the Nanjing negotiations. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A London dispatch from the Havas, Associated Press, and United Press reported that Britain is deeply concerned about the Sino-Japanese situation. If Japan establishes a protectorate over all or part of Chinese territory, Britain will not ignore it. This has caused quite a stir here. The Associated Press report that if Sino-Japanese negotiations fail, Britain is prepared to evacuate its expatriates in the Yangtze River basin has also attracted attention here. A Foreign Ministry spokesman today explicitly denied the Havas report that British Ambassador to Japan Clive had notified the Japanese government of Britain's concerns, and said that the British government had not formally reprimanded the Japanese government, and that British Ambassador Clive's inquiries to the Foreign Ministry about information on China were purely a personal initiative. The spokesman also said that the Japanese government has explained Japan's position on China to the British and American embassies and will do so again. Semi-official sources said that the Japanese government's attitude towards the Sino-Japanese dispute has not changed, and it still insists that the problems between the two countries should be resolved by the two countries, and does not allow any third country to interfere. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It was rumored that the British government had sent a document to the Japanese government regarding the overall Sino-Japanese situation. When a Foreign Ministry spokesman met with members of the press today, someone asked about this matter. The answer was that this statement was not true. The British government has not sent any documents to the Japanese government. Japan has not heard of any foreign attitudes towards the Sino-Japanese dispute. It was also rumored that Song Zheyuan and Lieutenant General Tashiro had reached a basic compromise on clarifying the situation in North China. The Foreign Ministry has not received any information. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese negotiations, the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States have attached great importance to their development and have taken various actions. Recently, it was reported that the British government had instructed its ambassador to the United States, Lindsay, to make suggestions to the United States government. On the one hand, it was reported that the British government had instructed its ambassador to Japan, Clive, to express his views to the Foreign Ministry regarding the Sino-Japanese negotiations. However, the Foreign Ministry clearly denied the news on the 6th, stating that the Japanese government has not accepted any suggestions from the British government on the China issue. British Ambassador to Japan Clive visited Foreign Minister Arita and Secretary-General Horiuchi on the 24th of last month to obtain information on the China issue, but this was a matter for the ambassador himself and was not based on any instructions from his home government, and did not go beyond the scope of obtaining information. However, before Ambassador Kawagoe started negotiations, the British and American governments speculated about Japan's demands on China. Because of the encroachment of Japanese power, they were worried that their national interests would be infringed upon, and they planned Anglo-American cooperation to hinder the smooth progress of Sino-Japanese negotiations. At the same time, they instructed the Governor of Hong Kong and the Ambassador to China to take action towards the Chinese side. However, the Japanese side insisted that Sino-Japanese negotiations should be resolved by the two countries and would not allow any third country to participate. Therefore, even if the United Kingdom and the United States or others put forward any suggestions, they would only be resolutely rejected. (5th Allied Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hirota Met with the Emperor Last Night to Report on Sino-Japanese Issues and General Political Affairs; The Center of Japanese Politics Has Moved to Hokkaido</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Hirota arrived in Hokkaido this morning. At 11:00, he entered the Sapporo Imperial University. It is scheduled to meet with the Emperor at the headquarters at 8:00 tonight to report on the progress of Sino-Japanese negotiations and general political affairs. (5th China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Aomori: Prime Minister Hirota arrived in Sapporo, Hokkaido, at 9:00 a.m. on the 5th. He plans to pay his respects to the Emperor after the completion of the grand exercises and report on the Sino-Japanese issue and other general political affairs. The Prime Minister has a strong determination to adjust relations between the two countries through Sino-Japanese diplomatic negotiations. The Japanese government's policy towards China is based on the so-called "Three Principles." (5th Allied Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Sapporo: After Prime Minister Hirota arrived in Sapporo on the morning of the 5th, the center of Japanese politics and military affairs has almost moved to this place. Sapporo is the location of the headquarters of the army's grand exercises. Army Minister Terauchi, Navy Minister Oikawa, Transportation Minister Maeda, Agriculture Minister Shimada, Justice Minister Hayashi and other cabinet members, as well as Generals Suzuki, Nara, Abe, Araki, Honjo, Kawashima, Matsuki, Matsui, Takarabe, Osumi, and other army and navy generals, Inspector General of Education Sugiyama, Korean Army Commander Koiso, Commander of the Imperial Guards Division Katsuki, Commander of the Second Division Okamura, and other important army figures are staying here. Prime Minister Hirota and other cabinet members plan to hold meetings here to exchange views on important matters such as the current China issue and administrative reform issues. Therefore, important political meetings will be held here temporarily. (5th Allied Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance: New Organization Law, Reorganization of Various Departments, Preparations Nearing Completion</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The new organizational law of the Ministry of Finance expands the scope of the General Affairs Department, changes the Accounting Department to the Audit Department, establishes a new Chief Accountant, changes the Salt Affairs Department to the Salt Affairs Division, and changes the Salt Affairs Audit General Office to the Salt Affairs General Bureau. After the Minister ordered preparations, they are largely ready. However, since most of the Ministry's offices are converted from private residences, they are not sufficient. New houses are now being built. After completion, the reorganization will be completed within the year. As for whether the salt transport commissioners in the salt-producing areas and the salt affairs audit branch offices will be changed to salt affairs administration bureaus in selected areas first, or reorganized at the same time as the above-mentioned departments, the Salt Affairs Department is planning in detail. However, the Guangdong and Guangxi salt areas will be implemented first, so as to start improving the salt administration in the Guangdong area. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>

Then he took a car with his wife to the official residence to rest. Many military and political leaders in Nanjing went to the residence to pay their respects. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek flew from Nanjing to Jiangxi on July 18 and stayed in Guling. Then, on August 11, he flew from Jiangxi to Guangdong to handle the Liangguang Incident and instructed on all follow-up matters. He stayed for more than 40 days and worked hard to promote national unification in the spirit of peace.

<p>(Tianjin) The rebel Yin visited Tashiro and Hashimoto at Haiguang Temple at 10:00 a.m. on the 5th to thank them for their help in resolving the Zhao Lei affair and had some discussions about the pseudo-organization.

<h3>Detailed Statistics by the Ministry of Finance on Two Types of Income</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Income Tax Office launched the collection of the second and third categories of income tax. The director, Gao Bingfang, ordered the second and third groups to collect and report salary and remuneration income and government bond interest income in detail so as to check against the actual amount collected. As for the total amount collected for the two categories, it is still difficult to estimate before the statistics are completed, because the collection of the second category is more universal than the income tax, so it cannot be estimated based on the income tax.

<h3>Guangzhou Press Circle Issues Statement on Current Situation: Key to Resolution Lies in Japan's Sincerity; Hankou Journalists Association Also Sends Telegram Expressing Views</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) The Guangzhou press circle expressed deep sympathy for the article "Our Common Opinions and Beliefs Amidst Tensions in Sino-Japanese Relations" issued by the Beijing and Shanghai press circles. They jointly published an article on the 5th, titled "How to Deal with the Current Situation," approximately one thousand words in length. The original text is as follows: The various newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai jointly issued an article respectfully advising the people of the whole country and the Japanese government, expressing the solemn stance of the media and sincere and honest opinions. After reading it, we not only share their equal enthusiasm but also feel a deep sense of sorrow and inspiration. Therefore, we specially unite with the newspapers in Guangzhou to discuss it. Today's Sino-Japanese situation has reached an extremely tense state. Our country is at a critical juncture of survival, rise, and fall. The great historical mission has descended upon the Chinese nation. How can our national citizens fulfill this great mission without regret? It lies in the national citizens' self-awareness and self-confidence. Regarding this, there are two points that we wish to sincerely tell our national citizens. First, the national citizens should make the greatest determination to dedicate their individual lives to the country and strive for the survival and competition of the entire nation. Our revolutionary leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, often used the supreme principle that "the life of an individual and the life of the nation are inseparable" to enlighten the people. This is the highest belief of our national citizens in loving our country and nation. An individual's life belongs to the entire country and nation. Only with the life of the entire country and nation can there be an individual's life. Saving an individual's life cannot have any private secrets. In today's era of prevalent nationalism, the principle of survival competition is believed by the world. How the future world will be cannot be predicted, but we, who live in the present world and bear the historical evolution of the Chinese nation, must adapt to the present world in order to prosper in the future. This is the fundamental plan for our Chinese nation to establish and build the country, not just to prepare for extraordinary events today. Second, the national citizens should have unified steps to support the central government's national policy of "not giving up peace until hope is lost, and never lightly sacrificing until the final moment." Peace is the highest morality of mankind, and patriotism is the duty of citizens. Maintaining a fair attitude towards these two is the practical spirit of our implementation of national policy. Our national citizens must fulfill their duty to love and defend the country while also doing their utmost to pray for and seek peace. To put it bluntly, the reason why we fulfill our duty to love and defend the country is to make our greatest efforts for human peace. Therefore, regarding today's situation, we believe that narrow revenge is only satisfying for a moment, and passionate anger is of no practical help. It is neither the usual way of patriotism nor the right path to peace. Our national citizens must deeply understand the true meaning of "great patience leads to great courage." Today, we have decided to dedicate our individual lives to the country and the nation. How the country and the nation will use our lives is only to trust the government sincerely and wait for the government's final command. When the government has not declared that peace is hopeless, we should calmly and firmly respond to the changes. On the day the government instructs us to make the final sacrifice, we will strive to be the first to die for glory. If our national citizens understand this matter and do their best, we can report to our ancestors without guilt and tell our descendants without shame. Secondly, what we expect from our neighboring country is, in short, that the way to resolve Sino-Japanese diplomacy is to restore the normal track of diplomacy, and the key lies in Japan's sincere reflection. The necessity of resolving the Sino-Japanese problem and improving Sino-Japanese relations is the common intention of the governments and people of both countries. However, how to resolve it and where to base the improvement require a deep understanding. The correct way to resolve it is to follow the normal track of diplomacy, and the real basis for improvement lies in establishing a foundation of equality and mutual respect. If we only point out vague principles, argue with each other, or use threats and retaliatory measures to compete with each other, it will not help the matter. Therefore, how to eliminate and save the tense situation today depends entirely on whether Japan has the sincerity to establish peace in East Asia. We sincerely hope that the Japanese government and people will deeply reflect on this day of crisis. (Central News Agency telegram on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Hankou Journalists Association issued a telegram on the 5th, echoing the "Intentions and Beliefs Regarding Sino-Japanese Relations" of the Beijing and Shanghai newspapers, stating: (1) Facing a great catastrophe, all our compatriots should endure for the sake of the country, abide by social order, and avoid increasing the government's difficulties. If our sincere efforts to seek compromise are not understood by the other party, and they insist on cutting off the vitality of our nation, then peace has reached a point of hopelessness and sacrifice has reached the final moment. All our national citizens should rise up together under unified command and orderly steps, sacrifice their lives and property, and defend the country with a spirit of rushing into boiling water and fire, to accomplish the great cause of turning heaven and earth. (2) What we hope from our friendly countries is that the key to whether Sino-Japanese relations can improve lies entirely with Japan. If Japan can have a broad vision, respect our territorial sovereignty, not hinder the survival of our nation, and establish a foundation for coexistence and co-prosperity based on the principle of mutual respect and mutual benefit, then not only will our government be happy to accept it, but all our people will also sincerely approve of it. If Japan insists on using the power of its aircraft and artillery to force us to sign treaties that will destroy our country and exterminate our race, then our national people would rather suffer under the city walls and leave endless worries to our descendants, and mothers would rather shed blood on the front lines and seek a way out of death for the country. (Central News Agency telegram on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Chengdu) The Chengdu press circle, considering the recent tense situation in Sino-Japanese relations, expressed sympathy for the joint article by the Beijing and Shanghai press circles and also jointly published an article, with the main points being: (1) Firmly believe that China will never perish; (2) Explain the limits of war and peace; (3) In recent years, who is to blame for the alienation of the feelings of the Chinese and Japanese people; (4) Historical evidence shows that those who embrace the doctrine of aggressive militarism are not the ultimate victors. Dare to warn the Japanese government and people not to be the leaders of destroying East Asian peace. (Central News Agency telegram on the 5th)</p>

This is a perfect opportunity to revive our country. How we use this opportunity to create a new life for our country is something that every citizen should never forget. At this time, we must deeply understand our responsibility to the country, do our best to work hard, and if everyone can do this, our country's strength can naturally be strengthened. At the same time, we must also understand that the government has a consistent policy for national affairs and must act under the government's consistent policy to achieve consistency from top to bottom and promote national progress. There must be no transgressions that increase the government's difficulties, because such behavior, no matter how legitimate the name, can often put the country at a disadvantage. This should be absolutely avoided. (Central News Agency telegram on the 5th)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Denies Political Negotiations with the Japanese, Claims to Have Discussed Sino-Japanese Aviation Issues, North China Mainly Focused on Peace</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan told reporters this morning that the recent rumors about various speculations on North China's diplomacy are not credible. He met with Tashiro several times in Tianjin regarding the issue of Sino-Japanese air traffic in North China, which was a continuation of negotiations that had not been settled by the previous Political Council and Military Branch Council. As for economic cooperation such as mining iron ore and laying railways, as long as it is truly equal and mutually beneficial and beneficial to both sides, he is willing to promote its realization with sincerity. Although the situation in Shanghai is tense recently, China and Japan are two major nations, of the same origin and culture, like brothers, sharing interests and obligations. All problems should never be resolved through war, nor can they be resolved by war. As long as both sides can meet each other with sincerity, they can clear the haze and transform it into peace, to achieve the effect of cooperation between the two major nations. North China is mainly focused on peace both internally and externally, because only under the principle of peace can we seek benefits and eliminate pain for the people. (Special telegram on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan met with Tashiro several times in Tianjin, and there were rumors that it involved the entire issue of North China. According to sources, Tashiro did not raise any opinions on the entire issue of North China. His repeated visits to Song were all about economic issues, mainly: 1. Aviation issues: Sino-Japanese cooperation invested in the construction of air routes, continuing the negotiations from the previous political council that had not decided that the Chinese side would account for two-thirds of the total capital and the Japanese side would account for one-third of the draft. 2. Longyan Iron Mine mining issues. 3. Cangshi Road construction issues. In short, both sides are currently adopting an attitude of discussing the facts based on the environment to solve the current practical problems. This morning, he received important officials from the Suiyuan Military and Political Council at his private residence, listening to reports on various important military and political issues. (Special telegram on the 5th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan returned to Beiping from Tianjin yesterday. When he met with Chinese journalists this morning, he stated that the rumors that he had political negotiations with Tashiro, the commander of the Japanese garrison in North China, were groundless. Song also mentioned Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, saying that he only sought to realize this move based on the principles of reciprocity and mutual benefit. It is reported that several days ago, there were rumors that Tashiro had made several harsh demands to Song, so Song denied having political negotiations with the Japanese authorities.

<h3>Preparations for the Sino-Siamese Association</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, after the return of the delegation to Siam, in order to promote Sino-Siamese culture and strengthen Sino-Siamese relations, they have proposed the establishment of the Sino-Siamese Association. The charter has been drafted by Siamese People's Representative Nai Salit and the Siamese Chinese Chamber of Commerce. The preparations for the association have been progressing actively in recent months, and many prominent figures in the overseas Chinese community have enthusiastically joined the association. On the 9th of last month, a meeting was convened at the Dah Han Kong Association in Siam to discuss and revise the association's charter. A preparatory committee of 21 members was established to be responsible for registering with the government. The selection of the chairman of the Siamese preparatory committee will be determined in the coming days. Once the preparatory committee is fully formed, it will proceed with registration with the government. (5th, Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Future Sino-Japanese Negotiations</h3>
<p>— Should</p>
<p>Kuwashima, the director of the East Asia Bureau of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. He is to convey the new instructions recently decided upon by Prime Minister Hirota and the three ministers of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs to Ambassador Kawagoe. There is renewed hope for the continuation of the interrupted Sino-Japanese negotiations to adjust diplomatic relations. What is the content of the new instructions brought by Kuwashima? Because both parties are maintaining strict secrecy, we have no way of knowing. However, judging from the current situation, we can also speculate that the negotiating policy indicated by the new instructions may be more moderate in nature and smaller in scope than all the demands already made by Kawagoe. But at its core, it must still contain a full spirit of aggression. In the Sino-Japanese negotiations on the 23rd of last month, our government clearly rejected Ambassador Kawagoe's demands. Since then, the Japanese army in North China has been preparing for large-scale exercises of a demonstrative nature. The Japanese Marines in Shanghai even extended their security lines to the banks of the Suzhou Creek. And the Japanese authorities have repeatedly claimed that they are prepared to take effective measures when necessary. A dangerous haze is indeed gathering in the skies of the Far East, endangering peace. However, discerning people can easily determine that using force at this juncture is extremely unfavorable to Japan. Now China has completed a unified situation politically, economically, and militarily. In terms of the public, patriotic sentiment has also risen to an extreme. As for Japan, not only is its finances without a way out, but also its international relations with other powers in the Far East have not improved. As everyone knows, Japan is accustomed to taking shortcuts. Unless it seizes an opportunity like the one in the September 18th Incident, it will not easily use force. It certainly does not want to go to war with China at this time. The Japanese authorities' spreading of war atmosphere, as the foreign press in Tokyo reported, is merely a threatening tactic to instigate the independence of North China. This time Kuwashima's arrival in China indicates that Japan intends to change its approach. Japan should modify its negotiating policy to be more 'reasonable.'</p>
<p>However, Japan's fundamental national policy is to expand its influence in China. No matter how 'reasonable' it modifies its negotiating policy, it cannot but infringe upon China's independent sovereignty. Moreover, now it is Kuwashima, the drafter of the Hirota Three Principles, who has brought the new instructions, and the threatening situation has not diminished. How can we expect Japan to have any fundamental modification of its policy toward China? However, in the current situation, if Japan wants to break the diplomatic deadlock, it cannot but consider the factor that has always played a significant role in Sino-Japanese issues, namely Britain. Therefore, it is very possible that it will modify its negotiating policy to a 'reasonable' degree that can gain British understanding. We remember Sir Otto Niemeyer's farewell advice to China to revise its tariffs. We know that the conservative elements in Britain have always regarded the emerging Japan as an important force to check the United States and Russia and may tacitly approve of Japan's free actions in North China. We also know that Britain is determined not to let war break out between China and Japan. So, can Japan's current negotiating policy seek a compromise with Britain? This is indeed a question that deserves our attention.</p>
<p>Based on the above, we cannot be too optimistic about future Sino-Japanese negotiations. Nor can we be too optimistic about the British authorities' close concern for the current situation in China.</p>

<h3>French Communist Party Congress, Anti-Fascist Demonstrations, Unite to Uphold Democracy, Right-Wing Crowds Resist Demonstrations, 1,000 Arrested and Immediately Released</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Communist Party's demonstration congress was originally scheduled to begin at 3:00 PM, but by 2:30 PM, all the podiums and seats in the Prince's Park stadium were already full, with an audience of 40,000 people, leaving almost no space. First, Communist Party leader Senator Cachin delivered a speech, saying, "The world is in turmoil, and the tide of Fascism is sweeping through various countries. Only France is still the only country with democratic politics. This is thanks to the strength of the Popular Front. The French Popular Front is based on 7 million workers, with 5 million already joining the General Confederation of Labor. This is why the Popular Front is so powerful." Then, Deputy Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Duclos, delivered a speech, saying that any attempt to divide the Popular Front was a "destructive policy." Regarding the devaluation of the franc, he said, "Our party, in order to alleviate the poverty of the people, has already stipulated in the Popular Front's program a method to reform the tax system based on democratic principles. This method was not adopted, and instead, it was replaced by currency devaluation, which our party did not approve of. The reason why our party voted in favor of the currency bill in the parliament was to maintain the Popular Front." Then, Communist Party Deputy Malter delivered a speech. Having recently returned from an investigation in Spain, Malter specifically defended against various slanders by foreign countries against the Spanish Republican government, and said that the Spanish rebels were receiving large amounts of military supplies from Italy and Germany, and that effective action should be taken immediately to lift the blockade against the Spanish government. He also said, "The French Fascist Party, after being completely defeated in the elections on May 3rd of this year, has been attacking the republican system and the French people with all its might. Therefore, we must unite our forces to complete the program of the Popular Front." Finally, Communist Party Secretary General Dorais delivered a speech, praising the various actions of the Chamber of Deputies and the government that benefited the working class, but said, "We must now pay attention to ensuring that these measures are strictly implemented. Workers' wages must be guaranteed, and unjustified price increases must be prohibited. The connection between the middle class and the general public is the most beneficial guarantee for both parties. Any concession to the reactionaries will inevitably lead to further encroachments. Taking the devaluation of the franc as an example, the only ones who will suffer losses will be the poor families. Therefore, I sincerely advise my comrades in the Socialist Party that if we make many promises beforehand but do not deliver on them afterward, causing most people to be disappointed, the result will inevitably allow those who specialize in empty rhetoric and intend to destroy to take advantage of the situation. This is why democratic politics in Germany and Austria failed. The lessons of the past are a warning. The Popular Front must not repeat the same mistakes." Regarding the Spanish issue, Dorais also said, "The government's neutral attitude toward the Spanish events is a disgrace. Surrendering to Fascism will not only fail to save peace, but will also harm it." (4th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>(Paris) The western district of Paris is a residential area for wealthy households. West of the Porte d'Auteuil is the famous Bois de Boulogne, with its dense forests and beautiful scenery, a place where Parisians usually relax and enjoy holidays. It is usually quiet and secluded, without the bustling atmosphere of the city. However, it has recently been transformed into a center of political demonstrations, with crowds of people moving about and shouting constantly, a truly rare phenomenon. The Communist Party held a demonstration congress in Prince's Park outside the Porte d'Auteuil this afternoon. Arrangements had been made in advance, and the Social Problems Research Association organized by Fascist leader Colonel de la Rocque also held a counter-demonstration at the same time. Although the government had issued a ban beforehand, it was not canceled. It is estimated that 40,000 people participated in the Communist Party's demonstration congress this afternoon, while 15,000 people participated in the Fascist counter-demonstration. Fortunately, the police maintained order, so the two sides did not engage in direct conflict, nor did any serious incidents occur, which was also fortunate. At noon today, the quiet area of western Paris was already crowded with people. Public and private cars, as well as underground trains, brought in passengers, thousands upon thousands, in an endless stream. At 1:00 PM, 2,000 demonstrators from the Social Problems Research Association arrived in formation, led by right-wing Deputy Grilys, and were dispersed by the police. At 4:00 PM, the Porte d'Auteuil square was extremely crowded, but no incidents occurred. Fascist Party demonstrators tried to break into the venue of the Communist Party's demonstration congress in Prince's Park, but were stopped by the police. A large number of people were arrested and temporarily detained in various police stations in the 14th arrondissement. At 5:45 PM, someone threw a flower vase at the police on the street from a cafe on Auteuil Street, and then used water bottles as weapons, throwing them into the center of the street. The police immediately drove the crowd out of the cafe and arrested many people. At around 6:00 PM, the crowd participating in the congress in Prince's Park began to exit. Thanks to the effective protection of the police, no conflict occurred with the Fascist crowd. By 7:00 PM in the evening, the crowd gradually dispersed, and the Auteuil area returned to calm. After the incident, a total of 1,300 people were arrested. Except for ten of them who were temporarily detained for illegally carrying weapons, the rest were released. Most of those arrested were members of the Social Problems Research Association, many of whom came from other provinces. The police authorities did not find out that a large number of people had come to Paris from various provinces this morning to participate in the Fascist counter-demonstration, because the Fascist Party felt that there were not enough people in Paris, so it temporarily mobilized people from various provinces. During today's demonstration, two members of the crowd and two police officers were injured and sent to the hospital. In addition, several police officers and members of the crowd suffered minor injuries and left after being bandaged at the pharmacy. There were no other major incidents. In addition, taxi drivers complained to the police that their cars were pelted with stones while carrying Communist Party members to Prince's Park for the meeting. There were a total of thirty such incidents. (4th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<h3>Conflicts Between Left and Right Wings in London, Stones and Glass Bottles Used as Weapons, Police Suppression, Many Arrested</h3>
<p>(London) British Fascist Party members marched in formation in the East End of London yesterday, injuring several people and arresting 84. When the incident first occurred on Royal Mint Street, the authorities, fearing that the demonstration would cause riots, immediately dispatched 5,000 special police officers to the area to suppress the unrest. The police had no choice but to use batons to disperse the crowd, resulting in injuries to several people, nine of whom were seriously injured and sent to the hospital for treatment. Soon after, Sir Oswald Mosley, the leader of the British Fascist Party, arrived and met with Police Commissioner Sir Game, who informed him that Fascist Party members were not allowed to march in the East End and were only allowed to pass through Blackfriars and disperse at Embankment. Subsequently, a large crowd attempted to rescue someone who had been arrested on Leman Street, and the police again used batons to suppress the unrest. The rioters were extremely violent, throwing stones and sharp objects at the police. Yesterday, many Fascist Party members drove cars through the streets, with iron mesh on the windows of the cars. Afterwards, Jewish and labor groups filed serious protests with the authorities, opposing the Fascist Party's demonstrations. The Jewish National Council submitted a document to the Home Office petitioning to ban Fascist Party members from demonstrating, with a total of 100,000 signatures. This morning, all newspapers detailed the riots that occurred during the Fascist Party members' demonstration in the East End yesterday. Newspapers estimated that 2,500 Fascist Party members participated, and 6,000 police officers suppressed the unrest. There were also 100,000 anti-Fascist Party members who joined in the protests. The worst riots occurred in the Stepney area. Fascist Party members robbed the lumberyard of a contractor on a street in the area and blocked the street with a loaded truck and paving stones. When the police arrived, the Party members threw stones and broken bottles at them, and threw garbage and wooden chairs out of the windows, and set off blank cartridges and firecrackers to scare the horses of the mounted police. The ground was littered with broken glass and stones to hinder the police's actions. The police repeatedly swung their batons to disperse the crowd, injuring several people. The street was eventually cleared. After the incident, various weapons were found, including iron bars, chair legs wrapped in barbed wire, and broken glass bottles. Fascist Party members now claim that the authorities' decision to ban the Party's march is a surrender to "Red terror." The Communist Party said that Fascist Party leader Sir Oswald Mosley has suffered the most shameful defeat. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>British Labour Party Congress Opens This Morning</h3>
<p>Female Chair Passes Resolution Protesting Blackshirt Atrocities</p>
<p>Edinburgh: The Labour Party Congress of the Opposition faction opened this morning. Chairperson Mrs. Adamson attended, with over 700 representatives. The chairperson delivered the opening address, saying that there was an insurmountable spiritual divide between Germany and its neighbors. The congress then passed a resolution protesting the atrocities committed by the British Fascist Party's Blackshirts during their march and demonstration in the East End of London yesterday, and demanding that the government investigate the background and sources of funding of the Party's leader, Sir Oswald Mosley. Morrison, the chairman of the London City Council, then spoke, criticizing Foreign Secretary Simon, saying that his failure to act against Fascism was cowardly. (5th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>Edinburgh: The Labour Party Congress will open here tomorrow. Several hundred representatives will attend, chaired by Mrs. Adamson. This is the second time a woman has served as chair in the 36 years since the Labour Party was founded. The first was Ms. Lawrence. The main issue of debate is what attitude the Labour Party should take toward Britain's rearmament program. This issue will be the dividing line between the pro-government faction and the anti-government faction. The Executive Committee has drafted a resolution which, in view of the threatening attitude and military expansion of various authoritarian countries in Europe, supports Britain's rearmament to fulfill its national responsibilities as a member of the League of Nations and to defend the rights and freedoms of the people, but reserves the Labour Party's right to criticize the government's policies at any time. The absolute pacifist faction will oppose the resolution, but it is expected that the resolution will pass by a majority. It is also expected that the Communist Party will again make efforts to organize a People's Front in Britain, but it is not expected to succeed because the trade unions do not support it. Internal divisions seem likely to consume a great deal of time in closed-door meetings. The Manchester Guardian today carries an editorial deeply regretting that the Labour Party will therefore expend much energy, and says that the Labour Party still feels that it has not yet produced a leader who can attract the attention of floating voters. The mechanism is now in place, but the heartbeat is rather weak. (5th, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Mussolini Announces 40% Devaluation of Italian Currency, Strict Measures to Prevent Price Hikes, Tax Reductions on Imports of Food and Fuel</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian Cabinet decided today to devalue the Italian lira by about 40%, with the exchange rate set at 90 lire to one pound sterling and 19 lire to one US dollar. The Cabinet also decided to reduce import duties to prevent price spikes. The import duty reduction for wheat is from 75 lire to 45 lire per 100 pounds, for fresh meat from livestock is reduced by 60%, for livestock it is reduced by 65%, for coal it is reduced from 10 lire to 5 lire per ton, for charcoal it is reduced from 42.5 lire to 30 lire per ton, and import duties on other food and raw materials are also reduced or even eliminated. (5th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini announced the devaluation of the Italian lira after this morning's cabinet meeting, with its new value set at 92 lire to one pound sterling and 19 lire to one US dollar. As for the amount of pure gold contained in the lira, it has also been stipulated that each 100 lire contains 4.677 grams of pure gold, whereas previously the amount of pure gold in each 100 lire was 7.9191 grams. Mussolini also announced that the tariffs on various essential necessities, including food and coal, will be reduced. The gold reserves of the Bank of Italy have been revalued according to the new parity and the difference paid by the Treasury. Landowners will be notified to purchase new 5% government bonds worth 5% of the net value of their property to offset the currency devaluation. Rents, gas, electricity, and public and private transportation services will not be increased for two years. Hotel or apartment owners who charge excessive prices will be severely punished. In addition, strict measures have been taken to manage the cost of food and other necessities of life. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Italian Economic Policy Leans Toward Liberalism</h3>
<p>(Rome) Although Italy's economic policy will continue to aim at self-sufficiency, as it did when the Italian-Abyssinian war began last October, in other words, the foreign trade policy will still be determined with reference to national defense needs, it is already more inclined towards liberalism. This can be seen from the Prime Minister's approval of the temporary suspension of the current restrictions on capital flows and foreign exchange. In short, although the date of full restoration of economic liberalism cannot be determined, it is clear that the new monetary policy has liberalism as its ultimate goal. (5th, Havas News Agency)</p>

<h3>Declaration of Sympathy from the Three Nations</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian Prime Minister fully agrees with the statement in the joint declaration of the three nations (England, France, and the United States) (i.e., issued after the establishment of the currency agreement) that the peaceful cooperation of all nations in the world should take economic recovery as its primary condition. The government will continue to strive to achieve economic autonomy, which is essential to national defense policy. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>Running Counter to Germany</h3>
<p>(London) After the Italian government decided to reduce the value of its currency, political figures here commented from a political point of view, saying that this runs counter to Germany's insistence on maintaining the current value of its currency. It shows that even countries implementing a dictatorship have realized the benefits of adjusting currency. It can be seen that the steps of Fascism and National Socialism are inconsistent. From an economic point of view, England and Italy are currently negotiating a trade treaty, and the negotiations will naturally be affected. British importers expect the prices of Italian agricultural products, wines, and rayon fabrics to decrease soon. However, British farmers, in order to protect their agricultural products, may demand that the government increase import taxes to counteract this. However, if Italy can follow France and reduce import tax rates, then it will be a different matter. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>London Not Surprised</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign exchange traders here did not express much surprise at Italy's decision to devalue its currency. Although some hinted that the extent of Italy's devaluation seemed greater than they had anticipated, the general opinion is that from a technical point of view, the lira market will not be materially affected because transactions involving the lira are strictly controlled. British merchants generally welcome Italy's reduction of import taxes on raw materials, but believe that the immediate benefits of the tax reduction are limited because merchants are unwilling to continue selling on credit to Italy before the previous debts are cleared. Currently, negotiations on clearing old debts are underway in Rome. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>France Appeals to the World: Reduce Tariff Barriers, Economic Prosperity May Be Expected; Establish a Committee to Control Domestic Prices</h3>
<p>(Paris) French Minister of Economy, Mr. Spinasse, appealed to all countries in the world via radio broadcast today to emulate France's example in reducing tariff barriers. It is said that international commercial meetings have begun and will be completed within a few weeks. At that time, the world's prosperity will surely become a reality. Before Mr. Spinasse gave this radio address, the French government ordered the establishment of a tariff commission to handle matters such as controlling prices, reducing import tariffs, various taxes and license fees, and relaxing quotas. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Minister of Economy Spinasse recently delivered a radio broadcast speech, strongly arguing that currency devaluation will not cause prices to rise. The past examples of England, the United States, and Belgium can be used as evidence. In terms of bread, milk, and wine, which are daily necessities for the people, their national distribution will not be affected by currency devaluation. However, the prices of some foreign goods may increase slightly, but goods imported from Switzerland and Belgium are an exception, because the currencies of Switzerland and Belgium have devalued along with the French currency. Spinasse went on to explain that the government has established price monitoring committees in various provinces to monitor price fluctuations in various places and take effective measures at any time to prevent price increases. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Economic Committee: Draft Resolution Content Proposed by the British Representative</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Second Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly, namely the Economic and Financial Committee, held a meeting this afternoon. The British representative, Mr. Morrison, the country's financial decision-maker, immediately proposed a draft resolution, advocating that all countries in the world should have equal access to certain raw materials. Regarding this matter, the League of Nations should consult with non-member countries and then organize another committee to discuss it, with the members of the League of Nations' Economic and Financial Standing Committees as ex officio members. Morrison also declared that the monetary agreement established by England, France, and the United States is a prelude to the development of international trade. The British government is currently taking two measures to promote the world's economic recovery. First, although the currencies of other countries have depreciated, the British import tax will not be increased as a result. Second, the United Kingdom intends to adopt all methods to prevent obstacles to international trade. France, the United States, and Switzerland have already promoted liberalism in the economy, and it is expected that other countries will follow suit. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>Egyptian Prime Minister Visits German Head of State: Denies Devaluing Currency</h3>

Nahas plans to meet with German Head of State Hitler on October 6, and then travel to Genoa, Italy, on October 8 to take a ship back to Egypt. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebel Army Converges to Attack Capital: North and South Roads Establish Contact; Fierce Fighting Occurs Near Toledo; Government Army's Counterattack on Oviedo Repulsed</h3>
<p>Lisbon: According to a bulletin issued by the rebel army, the north and south rebel armies attacking Madrid have recently established contact east of the city. The vanguards of these two armies met at Piedralbes when it fell, 50 miles east of the capital. At the same time, 90 government militiamen attempted to defend a specialized school in Toledo to resist the rebel army. It is now reported that they were all executed by firing squad after surrendering. The rebel army besieged this school for six days, and then set it on fire before capturing it. It is also reported that many other militiamen were captured by the rebel army when Toledo fell, and they have all been executed. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Yesterday, the rebel army launched a fierce attack with artillery and air force on various fronts near the capital, especially in the area of Toledo to the south of the capital and Navalperal to the west (more than 60 kilometers as the crow flies from Madrid). The government army resisted and launched a counterattack in Vargas, near Toledo, but was forced to retreat due to attacks by rebel aircraft. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Madrid: It is now believed that General Mola's troops, departing from the northwest, and General Franco's troops, departing from the southwest, will soon join forces. Once the two armies join forces, they will jointly attack the capital. According to rebel radio broadcasts, the government army's all-out attack on Oviedo has been defeated, and the People's Front troops have suffered heavy casualties. At the same time, it is reported that after the rebel army occupied Oviedo, the nuns returned to the convent. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Although political circles admit that some children have left the capital because they cannot find suitable food in the city, they declare that the authorities have not ordered people to leave the city. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Drug Menace to China: The World Suffers; U.S. Senator Submits Report</h3>
<p>Sacramento, California: Senator Woggl and Mezhjer today submitted a report to the Senate Narcotics Committee, stating that China is deeply affected by Japanese heroin and morphine, and the impact is enough to harm the whole world. No one knows whether Japan is willing to abide by existing treaties, but it is heard that all Japanese territories and northern China have become the main outlets for this drug. The California authorities should step up the crackdown on narcotics and announce Japan's actions to the world so that people will know that Japan is actually using this drug to achieve its ambition to conquer Asia.

<h3>Two Major Pending Issues: Japan-Russia Compromise; Fishing and Oil Issues; Border Disputes to be Negotiated</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Negotiations on the Japan-Russia fishing issue took a turn for the better on the 2nd of this month and reached a compromise. A formal signing will be held soon. At the same time, the issue of revising the North Sakhalin oil agreement was also resolved. Two major pending issues between Japan and Russia have been satisfactorily resolved. The remaining issues are only negotiations on determining the Manchu-Russian border and establishing a mediation committee. This issue is the most important event for establishing peaceful relations between Japan-Manchukuo and Soviet Russia. The Soviet authorities have recently expressed their intention to respond to Japan's negotiations with a sincere attitude. (Daimon Telegram, 5th)</p>
<h3>German Harvest Festival: Air Transport Demonstration; Heavy Rain Spoils the Scenery</h3>
<p>(Berlin) One of the features of the mass drill held on the Harvest Festival Thanksgiving Day in Buckeburg was a machine gun team descending from an airplane by parachute. When 30 parachutes suddenly descended from the air, the audience did not know what was happening, but in an instant, the teams were all assembled and moving. This performance was the first public demonstration in Germany. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Large gatherings to celebrate the harvest festival were held simultaneously throughout Germany at the end of this week. On the opening day, there was heavy rain, which greatly reduced people's interest. Today, German Head of State Hitler gave a speech to 500,000 farmers gathered in Buckeburg in central Germany. The speech was broadcast nationwide by radio. Most of it was a condemnation of farmers who resented the official agricultural prices, saying that if Germany's harvest decreased by 20 percent, disaster would be inevitable. As for the four-year plan, it can enable Germany to have countless large factories manufacturing raw materials within a year to supply Germany's needs. A year later, the world may be even less peaceful than it is today, and we can be the mainstay. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) One of the features of today's Harvest Festival Thanksgiving Day held in Buckeburg was the National Military Supplies Bureau's donation of 6,000 acres of flax to Head of State Hitler. This symbolic gesture is particularly meaningful because it shows that Germany, which previously relied on foreign countries for the supply of raw materials, can now produce them itself. The value of this flax is 650,000 marks, and it represents workers in flax factories working for six hours without pay. On the part of the workers, this is also a representative cash donation.

<h3>Opening of the International Labor Organization Maritime Conference; Speech and Proposals of Our Country's Representative, Zhao Banfu</h3>
<p>Berlin Correspondence: The 21st International Labor Conference Maritime Session is scheduled to open on October 6th. The Chinese labor representative designated by the government is Zhao Banfu. The speech given by Mr. Zhao at the conference, as well as our country's proposals, are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Speech at the Conference: Gentlemen, I am honored and delighted to participate in this International Labor Conference Maritime Session. Under the ardent hope of hardworking seafarers around the world, this conference brings together representatives of governments, employers, and labor from various countries to uphold justice and humanity. I respectfully represent all Chinese seafarers in celebrating the success of the conference and hope that the conference's work will not only satisfy seafarers in China and around the world but also eliminate the detrimental effects of international economic competition on seafarers. The director's report has clearly analyzed the situation of seafarers around the world. Regarding the situation of Chinese seafarers, I would like to take this opportunity to add a few words. Since various imperialists successively obtained navigation rights on Chinese inland waterways, Chinese seafarers have been employed by foreign shipping companies. Because their labor is cheap, and it is convenient for trade and transportation to and from China, their numbers have increased daily for over a century. Almost the entire world bears the footprints of Chinese seafarers. In 1922 (i.e., the 11th year of the Republic of China), Chinese seafarers, seeking to improve inequality in treatment and eliminate the contractor system, launched a large-scale strike on January 13th. I believe that those of you dedicated to social peace still remember this unprecedented chapter in the history of the struggle for a livelihood. After the Paris Peace Conference, Chinese seafarers hoped for international regulations on equal treatment and have been eagerly anticipating this day. However, for more than a decade, the hopes of Chinese seafarers have not made the slightest progress, and some foreign shipping companies, especially foreign shipping companies based in China, have become increasingly harsh in their treatment of Chinese seafarers. Now, I would like to mention some of the most prominent examples for your consideration. As mentioned above, the great strike of Chinese seafarers on January 13, 1922, aimed to improve unequal treatment and eliminate the contractor system. Chinese seafarers hate unequal treatment for the same work and the exploitation of the contractor system more than poisonous snakes and fierce beasts. Although the strike resulted in a victory for the seafarers, the shipping companies not only failed to fulfill their promises afterward but also gradually intensified their practices as time passed. Until now, their procedures for employing Chinese seafarers do not seek healthy and legitimate Chinese seafarer unions but directly negotiate extremely harsh employment terms with contractor bosses who aim to profit and exploit. The seafarers themselves have no freedom to choose ships, and they have absolutely no opportunity to participate in the content of the employment terms. Thus, the contractor bosses, on the one hand, obtain the most arduous labor for the shipping companies at the lowest wages and, on the other hand, routinely demand various introduction fees from the seafarers. Under this double exploitation, it is impossible for seafarers to secure a basic livelihood, leading to frequent suicides. In addition to using contractor bosses to squeeze cheap labor from seafarers, shipping companies also force seafarers to pay a deposit ranging from 300 to 700 yuan per person. Faced with the fear of unemployment, seafarers have no choice but to borrow at the highest interest rates to pay the deposit. The wages of Chinese seafarers are low, with the highest being no more than 44 yuan per month and the lowest being only 8 yuan per month. It is impossible to maintain the livelihood of their families or themselves, let alone pay interest. Gentlemen, if this tragic situation is not immediately addressed, the consequences for Chinese seafarers, driven by the demands of survival, are unimaginable. From an economic perspective and from the perspective of human peace, if the issue of equal treatment is not regulated and inhumane and illegal systems are not eliminated, capitalists, having so many advantages to exploit, will inevitably employ low-cost seafarers as much as possible to engage in international or private enterprise competition. As a result, not only will Chinese seafarers be forever reduced to a life of servitude, but seafarers from all countries will also suffer greatly. Because capitalists, on the one hand, obtain the most arduous labor of Chinese seafarers at the lowest cost and, on the other hand, will inevitably deceive or reduce the employment of their own high-cost seafarers as much as possible. In recent years, the world's economic and unemployment crises have become increasingly severe. Chinese seafarers residing abroad are subject to discrimination by local governments and exclusion by local seafarers of the same class. Although there are many reasons for this, the common sentiment is that Chinese seafarers have taken away their livelihoods. As such, racial discrimination and animosity arise among seafarers. How can one hope for human peace? Gentlemen, we are all here to seek human peace. We cannot sit idly by and ignore the increasingly severe trend of human conflict. We must recognize that the path to human peace cannot be built by labor, capital, or government alone. It requires the enlightened and unified efforts of everyone. To break this crisis, I believe that the only way is to immediately ensure equal treatment for Chinese seafarers. In addition, I have one more matter to report to you. In June 1927 (i.e., the 16th year of the Republic of China), the Hong Kong government, citing the pretext of Communist Party disturbances, closed the Hong Kong branch of the Chinese Seafarers' Union. In recent years, despite repeated negotiations with the Hong Kong government, the results have been zero. Freedom of association for workers is permitted by the laws of civilized countries around the world. The Chinese Seafarers' Union, under the supervision of Chinese government laws, is an organization that protects the economic interests of seafarers. Whether the Hong Kong government's refusal to allow the restoration of the Hong Kong branch is due to a misunderstanding that the Chinese Seafarers' Union is an organization with political functions or whether the policy of the Hong Kong government, which claims to be governed by law and civilization, does not allow for a legitimate seafarers' organization, is a mystery that I cannot understand. Chinese seafarers cherish peace and, unless absolutely necessary, do not wish to have a second "1922" great strike. Therefore, they have endured and tolerated for ten years. Today, I represent the Chinese seafarers of my country in requesting the assistance of international justice. I hope that the International Labor Office will also provide strong assistance to Chinese seafarers on this issue. Finally, I solemnly declare that Chinese seafarers fully support the work and policies of the International Labor Organization and believe that the International Labor Conference is the gateway to human peace and all justice, and will give a satisfactory answer to seafarers in China and around the world.</p>
<p>Proposals by the Chinese Representative: 1. Regarding the issue of equal treatment for domestic and foreign seafarers, please decide to include it in the agenda of the next session and promptly draft a convention. (Explanation) In 1936, the 20th International Labor Conference discussed "The Recruitment and Placement of Migrant Workers" submitted by the Labor Office, and the conference decided to include it in the agenda of the 1938 conference. In particular, regarding the issue of equal treatment for migrant workers, the conference made great efforts to promote the principles of human peace, equality, and justice. The work of seafarers is related to life safety and public interest, and its difficulty and burden are no less than that of ordinary workers, and it does not differ due to racial differences. Seafarers have been awaiting international regulations on fair treatment for sixteen years. From an economic point of view, if the issue of equal treatment is not jointly negotiated internationally, shipowners of countries with higher wages will inevitably employ seafarers from countries with lower wages as much as possible to engage in international or private enterprise competition. To avoid sacrificing seafarers to engage in such competition, this issue cannot be ignored any longer. Also, the 13th Maritime Conference in October 1929 passed the following resolution: "The issue of equal treatment for Asian seafarers should be placed on the agenda as soon as possible, and the Labor Office should pay attention to the investigation of this fact." Although the passage of this proposal only mentions Asian seafarers, its spirit and effect are to seek human peace and eliminate international or private competition. Its importance has already been recognized by the conference. Based on the above explanation, please decide to include this issue in the agenda of the next session and draft a convention. 2. Please suggest that relevant member states assist the Chinese government and the Chinese Seafarers' Union in effectively eliminating the contractor system. (Explanation) The contractor system is the most inhumane system for exploiting workers, which needs no explanation. The 2nd and 9th Maritime Conferences in 1920 and 1926 respectively formulated two draft conventions, "Facilitating the Employment of Seafarers" and "Conditions of Seafarer Employment Contracts". The spirit of these two draft conventions is to protect the interests of seafarers during employment so that they are not contracted by agencies or individuals for profit and exploitation. The meaning is very clear. Since the Chinese government established its capital in Nanjing, it has strictly prohibited the contractor system. But the most unfortunate thing at present is that some foreign shipping companies, especially foreign shipping companies based in China, negotiate all their procedures for employing Chinese seafarers with contractor bosses, with extremely harsh employment conditions. The seafarers themselves have no freedom to choose ships, and they have absolutely no opportunity to participate in the content of the employment terms. The contractor bosses, in addition to demanding various introduction fees from the seafarers, also demand them from the companies. On the company side, because they can obtain the most arduous labor at the lowest wages, they are happy to pay the introduction fees. Although they are taken directly from the company, they are still taken indirectly from the seafarers, and the company still has surplus profits to be made. Faced with the fear of unemployment, seafarers have no choice but to seek a basic livelihood through layers of exploitation, but as a result, their lives cannot be secured, leading to frequent suicides. The occurrence of such inhumane and illegal facts is a regret for social justice and the conference. It should be suggested that relevant member states assist the Chinese government and the Chinese Seafarers' Union and warn their foreign shipping companies based in China to effectively eliminate it. 3. Please suggest that relevant member states assist the Chinese Seafarers' Union in effectively eliminating the deposit system. (Explanation) Chinese seafarers who serve in various foreign shipping companies based in China, in addition to being contracted by illegal contractor systems, are also required by the companies to pay a deposit ranging from 300 to 700 yuan per person. Faced with the fear of unemployment, seafarers have no choice but to borrow at the highest interest rates to pay the deposit, resulting in their monthly salary income being insufficient to maintain their livelihood after paying interest. The salaries of Chinese seafarers are low, with the highest being no more than 44 yuan per month and the lowest being only 8 yuan per month, and they must provide their own meals. With such meager treatment, it is already impossible to maintain the minimum livelihood of their families or themselves, let alone the exploitation of the contractor system and the deposit system. We urge all of you at the conference to pay close attention to the cruelty of this issue, suggest that relevant member states earnestly warn their foreign shipping companies based in China, and assist the Chinese Seafarers' Union in effectively eliminating it.</p>
<h3>Zou Lu Returns to China and Arrives in Guangzhou; Fell Ill En Route and is Resting at Home for Several Days; Zou Advocates Transforming the Foundational Concepts of Education; Replacing Utilitarianism with the Teachings of Benevolence and Love</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Zou Lu, a standing committee member of the Central Executive Committee and president of Sun Yat-sen University, has been abroad for four months. Recently, after attending the Third World Education Conference and participating in the 550th Anniversary Celebration of the University of Heidelberg in Germany, he began his return journey. He initially boarded the Italian ship "Conte Verde." However, when passing through Singapore, the ship's machinery was damaged, and he transferred to the British postal ship "Carthage" to sail eastward. On the 30th, he arrived in Hong Kong. Zou's staff and comrades had been waiting in Hong Kong to welcome him. Members of the Guangdong Party, military, political, and academic circles who went to Hong Kong to welcome him included Hu Wencan, Luo Yiqun, Wu Zhimei, Li Xiangen, Xiang Hanping, Xie Yibang, Li Xiaosheng, Chen Ce, Tan Huiquan, Zou Zhuoran, Zheng Yanfen, He Yanyan, Liu Jiwen, and others, numbering over a hundred. At approximately 1:00 PM that afternoon, the "Carthage" slowly docked at the Kowloon Wharf. Mr. Zou, ailing, emerged to greet those who had come to welcome him. Due to the arduous journey, he had fallen ill several days prior. However, he shook hands and exchanged greetings with those who welcomed him, speaking normally. Afterward, he went directly to the welcome reception hosted by seven Hong Kong organizations. Due to his discomfort, Mr. Zou did not give any interviews to reporters. He only handed over a written statement on educational philosophy, advocating for the reform of the foundational concepts of education, to the newspapers for publication. The statement's main points are: "The mission of education is not only to provide knowledge to the current society but also to create benefits for humanity. If it only provides knowledge to the current society, then in this world of the survival of the fittest, education at all levels and all sciences will only increase the ferocity of its sharp teeth and claws. In fact, all countries are currently preparing for war. Directly, this is through the increase and improvement of armaments. Indirectly, all food, transportation, industry, and other aspects are preparing for war. What promotes its authority for war is education. This is no different from politicians and militarists wanting to kill, and educators preparing excellent executioners and excellent killing knives for them. In this situation, if another major war occurs in the world, humanity will inevitably die at the hands of the executioners prepared by educators. The reason education has achieved this result is due to the erroneous foundational philosophy of education, driving humanity towards the path of war. If this foundational philosophical thought is not improved and created by education, then a world of humans devouring each other will inevitably be seen in the future. Therefore, the responsibility of educators at present must extend beyond the scope of current society and seek happiness for future humanity. The path to achieve this is to integrate the essential meanings of love for humanity from various religions and scholars in the past, and to integrate and organize them using scientific methods. With the ultimate goal of universal harmony, establish a philosophical foundation of extending oneself to others, benevolence to the people, and love for all things, to replace the current world's philosophy of competition and mutual struggle. In this way, the cruel devastation of war can be eliminated through educational philosophy, and humanity can obtain the most advanced science in this philosophical foundation of benevolence and love, for production, for distribution, for growth, for education, and for nourishment. Then education will truly bring benefits to humanity and will also have meaning. Whether education brings happiness or disaster to humanity depends entirely on the 'shift' in the purpose of education," etc. Due to his illness, Mr. Zou could not stay in Hong Kong for long. He boarded the "Tianyi" ship the next morning to return to Guangdong Province. Several hundred representatives from the Party, political, and academic circles in Guangdong Province were waiting at the pier to welcome him, carrying banners with slogans such as "Welcome Principal Zou back to the University" and "Welcome Committee Member Zou back to the Country," lined up on both sides of the road, creating a lively atmosphere. At 2:30 PM, the "Tianyi" ship docked, and Mr. Zou went ashore. He shook hands with each of the welcoming representatives. He then drove back to his private residence on Dongdi Road to rest. The welcoming party drove their cars, waving flags and setting off firecrackers, following behind to celebrate. After returning to his private residence, Zou first sent Xiao Guanying as his representative to Sun Yat-sen University in Shipai to meet with the deans of the various colleges and inquire about the recent situation of the university. It is reported that Zou, still recovering from his illness, has temporarily declined various social engagements and will return to the university to resume his duties after he recovers.

<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Widespread Malignant Malaria</p>
<p>Since January, malignant malaria has been prevalent in various villages, affecting two to three-tenths of the entire population. The symptoms are similar to those of a sudden illness, with no chills, and the fever does not decrease after sweating. It often takes more than ten days to recover, and many people have died. Doctors are making rounds day and night, unable to keep up. Poor patients cannot even afford to seek medical treatment. Pharmacies are also making double the profit.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Expanding Air Defense Propaganda</p>
<p>The Wuxi Air Defense Exhibition has been in preparation for many days. All kinds of equipment have been arranged in various exhibition rooms in the park for days. All the staff are extremely busy. Yesterday afternoon, the propaganda group of the exhibition held its first group meeting at the county education bureau. Those who attended were Zhang Manyu and Liang Zhiping, instructors of the air defense exhibition, Wang Zhaolong, director of the education bureau, Xu Chizi, head of the propaganda group of the air defense exhibition, and more than ten principals of primary and secondary schools. The meeting was chaired by Xu Chizi, and the following resolutions were made: (1) to formulate the number of propagandists assigned to each school and to determine the principles for selecting team leaders and members; (2) to have the propagandists from each school watch an air defense film at the Zhongnan Theater on October 7th from 8:00 AM to 9:30 AM. After 10:00 AM, the propagandists will receive instruction from the organizers of the air defense exhibition and then depart to give speeches; (3) to schedule the team members to gather at the park on October 9th at 3:30 PM to visit the air defense exhibition; and (4) to determine the locations for the speech teams from each school to give their speeches. The association also believes that the designated areas for each propaganda team are not yet comprehensive enough. In addition to carrying out practical propaganda in the tentatively designated locations, each school should further carry out propaganda in nearby other townships and towns to expand the propaganda force. From the 8th to the 14th of this month, 200 speech teams will be temporarily formed, organized by 1,000 team members. Each team will have one team leader and four team members. Each school will have one chief captain, who will be a faculty member. At 5:00 PM, the association also invited the deputy editors of various newspapers, including Jiang Dabai, Zhu Bingdie, Yu Shaozhou, Sun Boliang, and Zhang Rongliang. The association's instructor, Zhang Manyu, hosted them. Regarding the publication of special air defense supplements in various newspapers, it was decided that special air defense supplements would be published in the deputy sections of various newspapers starting on October 10th. The content will focus on air defense construction. Each newspaper will publish continuously for five days.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>Chairman Huang Visits Jiashan for Inspection</p>
<p>Provincial Chairman Huang Shaohong arrived in the county today on the 11:00 AM express train with a very small entourage. County Magistrate Yu Shumi, Standing Committee Member of the County Party Committee Shen Jiren, and section chiefs Guan Pengfan and Hu Weixin, etc., went to the station to welcome him. After Mr. Huang got off the train, he took a rickshaw into the city, first going to the Qixin Hotel for a short rest. Then he went to the county junior high school for lunch. He then set off to inspect the construction status of the Hangzhou-Fengjing Road. Finally, he went to the county government to inspect the Baojia system and asked about it in detail. After the official business was completed, he returned to the province by night train.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Police Arrest Female Opium Trafficker at Station</p>
<p>The county government of this county suddenly received a phone call from Shanghai, stating that a female opium trafficker was carrying a large amount of smuggled opium and would be arriving in Changshu. After receiving the call, the county government immediately ordered officials from the anti-smoking section to accompany patrol captains from the Public Security Bureau to meet the train and conduct an inspection. Near Taicang Station, they found a carriage containing only a woman. She identified herself as Ma Wu. Two hemp bags were found on the roof of the carriage, filled with smuggled opium, estimated to be over two hundred taels. They were immediately taken to the county government. She confessed to the names of her accomplices, Zhang Maoli, the Zhang Maochun brothers, and Ma Changsheng. Unexpectedly, when they arrived at their destination, Zhang Maokui and Ma had already heard the news and fled. Only Zhang Maochun was still ill and was found in bed when the case was discovered. He could not escape and died of fright in bed. When the police went to arrest him, not only was there no one at home, but no one claimed the body. Currently, the county government plans to transfer the female opium trafficker Ma Wu to the Wuxi District Security Command for investigation.</p>
<h3>Haizhou</h3>
<p>Notorious Bandit Chen Bujin Arrested</p>
<p>Chen Bujin, also known as Xiao Yejiji, from Gaoyou, has been a bandit for many years. He was arrested in Shuyang County last month. The county government repeatedly interrogated him, and he confessed to robbery. Recently, the Gaoyou County government received a report and sent personnel to Shuyang to bring him back to Gaoyou for interrogation. According to reports, Chen led hundreds of bandits in the Gaoyou area, burning, killing, and looting, running rampant without restraint. He personally killed over a hundred people. There were numerous accusations against him, and the Gaoyou County government had offered a reward of 1,500 yuan for his arrest. He had been arrested several times, but he had either escaped en route or broken out of prison and fled. This time, he was arrested in Shuyang, and he will surely be publicly executed to eliminate this scourge.</p>

<h3>Shen Yugong Discusses the World Games Basketball: Our Country's Failure, Still Don't Understand the Tournament Rules, Dong Shouyi Should Bear Considerable Responsibility</h3>
<p>After the news of our country's basketball team's disastrous defeat in the World Games spread, the entire nation was indignant. Now, all the representatives have returned to the country and arrived in Shanghai. The reporter from Guoguang News Agency interviewed Mr. Shen Yugong, a veteran Lianghua team member and World Games representative, at Mr. Delin's residence. He explained the reasons for our basketball team's failure in the tournament as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Shen stated that regarding the reasons for our basketball team's disastrous defeat, the old arguments of not having recovered physical strength and being nervous were certainly factors. However, the most important reason is that Mr. Dong (Shouyi) should be responsible. This is because when Mr. Dong was training at Qinghua, he taught new rules, such as that after a free throw is made, there is no need to go to the center line to jump ball, taking two steps counts as a foul, and he mostly practiced the new ten-second rule. Unexpectedly, this time they were still using the old rules from before 1934. So, when we arrived there, what we had learned was not applicable, and we rushed to change our methods, but our hands and feet were not coordinated, and we were out of sync. When the competition day arrived at the tournament, Mr. Dong fell ill, truly ill. Although he also had the desire to win, he had expressed before the game that he would go onto the court despite his illness. Later, the hospital warned him that if he went out and something dangerous happened, they would not be responsible. Finally, Mr. Dong panicked and called Mr. Li An to entrust him with many on-the-spot strategies. However, what Mr. Dong had in mind was completely different from the situation during the game, so Mr. Li was also unable to cope. This is because he had to follow Mr. Dong's instructions and could not make decisions casually. For example, Mr. Dong instructed him when to substitute players, but when Mr. Li arrived, he saw that they were not allowed to substitute players. Even if it was necessary to substitute, he could not put them in. Also, there was a limit of at most seven players entering the court, so he also panicked and was unable to take measures. You see, the instructor is the commander of an army, but now there is a lack of command, and the players on the spot naturally have more concerns. How could they not lose?</p>
<p>In short, we have failed and let down the country's trust. However, looking back at the situation at the time, there are some regrets. That is, our country lacks organization.</p>
<p>Before the World Games basketball tournament began, the Japanese players saw our skills during practice. They even asked the tournament authorities to change the order of the games, wanting to avoid meeting our country in the preliminary round. However, we didn't know this until the game was about to start. We only learned about the Japanese request later. At that time, who didn't predict that we would win?</p>
<p>As for the skills of the American team, their tall stature certainly gave them a lot of advantages. However, their coach was also incomparable to ours. They could lose in the first half, but they could always win in the second half. This is the power of guidance. Because their guidance only requires a simple signal, and the whole team is like a completely different team. All the strategies follow the coach's intentions. As for their passes, they never fall into the hands of others. Furthermore, with their tall stature, the ball is still in their hands. Even when they are in dire straits, they have a tactic, which is to pass from afar, with the center standing in a suitable position and able to score with two steps. However, they are unwilling to do this.</p>
<p>Later, when the reporter asked about the situation of the Tianjin Lianghua team, he said that the veteran Lianghua team members are now running around for food and clothing. Therefore, it will probably not be easy to form a strong Lianghua team in the future. Logically speaking, the strength of a group requires taking care of the lives of its members and keeping them together permanently, which is impossible. Therefore, I also hope that the government will come forward to organize a national team, actively train them, and hope to compete in the next World Games.</p>
<p>Finally, he said that he would stay in Shanghai for one or two more days and then go north to Tianjin on the seventh. As for Xu Zhaoxiong, because his home is in Shanghai, he will not go to Tianjin for the time being.</p>

<h3>Reflections on Participating in the World Games and Traveling in Europe: The Rebirth of Germany (1)</h3>
<p>— Li Huitang</p>
<p>As the English proverb says, "Heaven helps those who help themselves." The German spirit of self-governance is deeply understood by both men and women. In a great occasion, they divide the work and cooperate, but do not rely on others. Even between men and women, there is no habit of excessive politeness. In the car, young women rarely give up their seats, except for the elderly or those with disabilities. Everyone goes their own way, without paying attention to others, nor expecting others to pay attention to them. In middle- and lower-class families, they never dream of having servants. The housewife always takes care of the housework herself. Even in wealthy families, there are very few employees. Occupations in society are also distributed very evenly. It is said that women who are married and have husbands to support them are not allowed to look for jobs again, so as not to block the opportunities of others. Therefore, there are very few unemployed workers in Germany. In short, their—especially the women's—spirit of self-governance is truly admirable.</p>
<p>(7) Promotion and Reward of Sports</p>
<p>The health of the German nation, the robustness of both men and women, is largely due to the great gains made by the government and society in promoting sports. Sports venues are everywhere in any city, and places for rest and recreation are also well considered. Like Berlin, a city with millions of people, the land is worth its weight in gold, but in the middle of the city, there is a vast and lush park. It is said that physical education has begun to be compulsory in elementary schools, and it has become a required subject in middle schools and universities. The German tradition of fencing has not yet disappeared. We often see strong men with scars on their faces on the road. The number of scars is a sign of the depth of experience. The more scars, the more respected they are by women. They love heroes and athletes, which is something that other countries cannot match. Like the acrobatic boxing master "Smith," the whole country treats him as a national hero and loves him. Even the leader Hitler personally encouraged and praised him. Also, the winner of the modern pentathlon at this conference was a German officer. The day after he won, he was promoted two ranks. Who wouldn't want to work hard to sow good seeds and cultivate them carefully, hoping for the same harvest in the future? Who wouldn't want to put in special effort in the way of sports? It is said that in recent years, the government and society have established standards for various sports. Anyone who can reach or exceed those standards will be awarded medals or certificates according to their performance. People with considerable skill can test themselves anytime and anywhere. This is truly an excellent way to promote and reward. This is why Germany has achieved excellent results in the conference. A certain sports magazine said it well, "The progress of sports depends on the cultivation and growth in ordinary times, and it goes hand in hand with culture. One or two days of training is in vain." "Athletic progress is from growth and culture, and not from mere training." Our country always digs a well when thirsty and plays the trick of helping seedlings grow by pulling them up. How can we compare to others?</p>
<p>(8) Uniform Commodity Prices</p>
<p>When we first went to Germany to buy souvenirs, we wanted to be careful and inquired about the prices of goods everywhere, but we ran an infinite amount of unnecessary errands. It turned out that all local or foreign goods in Germany have been reviewed by the General Chamber of Commerce, and the prices are uniform and unchangeable. No matter if you go from the east side of the city to the west side, you will never find a slightly cheaper price for the same item. If someone privately sells goods at a lower price, the government will severely punish them if they find out. However, there are still Jewish shops where you can get a discount if you are introduced by an acquaintance. This kind of activity is a secret within a secret and cannot be made known to others. Germany's recent exclusion of Jews is probably one of the reasons for this. Uniform commodity prices can eliminate the evils of unscrupulous merchants monopolizing, defrauding, and deceiving. It is indeed beneficial to society and the people. I hope that our country's chambers of commerce will also rise up and follow suit. Although our country is vast and rich in resources, and it may be a bit difficult to do, if the chambers of commerce in various places cooperate without fear of trouble, there will be a day when it can be done.</p>
<p>The above eight points are the facts that I know in more detail and are worthy of learning from. Other things such as the magnificent construction (all scientific), the might of the military and police, and the convenience of transportation (just in Berlin, there are trains, long-distance buses, trams, subways, elevated trains, airships, and airplanes. Just trams alone, there are more than 170 routes in the city, and nearly 300,000 cars) are all things that Germans can be proud of. I am not bragging for them, but the facts tell us that our country looks uglier in comparison. Although I love my country as much as anyone else, I dare not argue for it or conceal it, cover up my conscience, and bury the good things of others. However, things are done by people. Today's Germany was not created or given by God. It is the good fruit obtained through its own struggle and striving. Since we are all human beings, what others can succeed in, why should we be afraid? May my compatriots work together with one heart and rise up to fight, and strive to catch up.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Sets Examination Items for Vocational School Performance</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th: The Ministry of Education believes that the education administrative organs in various provinces and cities do not have consistent and specific standards for assessing the performance of vocational schools. It has specifically set four items that should be noted when examining the performance of vocational schools. On the 5th, it ordered various education bureaus to forward them for compliance.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Advisor Gu Zhaolin's Report on Inspecting Education in Shandong Province</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued an order to the Shandong Provincial Department of Education on the 3rd, stating: According to the report on inspecting education in Shandong Province submitted to the Ministry by Gu Zhaolin, Advisor of the Ministry, the department has achieved considerable success in handling compulsory education, and deserves commendation. In addition, there are many commendable aspects regarding various other educational endeavors. Now, the inspection opinions submitted are copied and issued separately. You are hereby instructed to comply with them and report back. This order includes a copy of the inspection opinions as follows:</p>
<p>(1) At the beginning of the establishment of provincial short-term elementary schools, the department took overall responsibility for the situation, assigning personnel to various districts to oversee the implementation. As a result, they were established on schedule, with consistent methods, meticulous planning, and thorough preparation, demonstrating great effort. However, due to the urgency of time, the training period for teachers was somewhat short and should be extended slightly during the next training session.</p>
<p>(2) The short-term elementary schools in the counties inspected, such as Qingcheng, Qidong, Linzi, Yidu, Weixian, Huangxian, Penglai, and Pingyuan, were filled with students, teachers were working diligently, the format was orderly, and the spirit was invigorated. Overall, they have achieved considerable results and are highly commendable.</p>
<p>(3) The department's method of establishing a local elementary school communication network centered on the fifth section of each county has been effective in conveying government orders, introducing knowledge, and promoting communication. However, the scope of material for the elementary school communication network and the "Basic Education Monthly" should be expanded and enriched.</p>
<p>(4) The academic performance of general short-term elementary school students is comparable to that of students completing the second grade of regular elementary school. Those who are slightly older are comparable to the upper semester of the third grade of regular elementary school. If they can continue for one year, they can roughly equal the graduation level of regular elementary school. The department already had a plan to select some short-term elementary schools to extend for one year, which should be approved for pilot implementation. According to the Henan Provincial Kaifeng Education Experimental Zone, the experiment of completing the four-year curriculum of regular elementary school in two and a half years has already achieved results. However, the age of admission is still based on the school age of elementary school. The school age of short-term elementary schools is higher, so it is more likely to complete the four-year curriculum of regular elementary school in two years. If successful in the future, changing rural regular elementary schools to short-term elementary schools will increase their effectiveness many times over.</p>
<p>(5) According to the actual situation in the whole province, there are only two ways to expand short-term compulsory education: one is to retain the original school foundation and continue to operate, and the other is to establish new schools in locations where schools have not been established. According to the current situation, there is a feeling of average distribution, with a slight tendency to be scattered. Although the "Elementary School Communication Network" is implemented to the greatest extent, it is difficult to completely remedy the situation. The local conditions should be considered. In the moderate locations of the townships, where the school foundation is better and there are more out-of-school children, the number of grades should be increased. It is not necessary to limit one class per school. The principals should be selected from those with proven results, in order to establish the center of the short-term elementary school and achieve the practical results of communication and unity.</p>
<p>(6) In general short-term elementary schools, there are more female students. In the counties of Jiaodong, almost all are female students, and male students are almost non-existent. Among the female students, there must be many who are older and need training in household affairs. In the next selection of teachers, female teachers who are from the local area, physically strong, and qualified should also be employed to facilitate practical needs.</p>
<p>(7) Since Changshan Islands are a special zone and are not subordinate to Penglai, short-term elementary schools should be established there. The department should decide the number of schools to be established based on the dispersed residence of the islanders, or compare it to counties of the same population and divide them into cases. The department should decide how to handle this.</p>
<p>(8) Yang Chengrong, the magistrate of Qingcheng County, has not been in office for long, but he has been able to plan in many ways in a poor area. Within a short period of time, he has completely popularized compulsory education in the whole county, which is truly enthusiastic and responsible. He should be commended as an encouragement.</p>
<p>(9) The school buildings and equipment of general elementary schools in the counties of Jiaodong are quite impressive. However, the salaries of teachers are quite uneven, and the teaching methods are also outdated. The department should select a moderate location (Yantai or Weixian), assign a special commissioner to preside over the organization of training classes, seminars, and research meetings to teach practical knowledge of teaching and moral education, and stimulate their interest to change the atmosphere and improve their skills.</p>
<p>(10) The provincial No. 1 Experimental Elementary School, the attached elementary school of the Jinan Women's Normal School, and the Jinan Municipal No. 1 Experimental Elementary School have achieved results in their past experimental work. The future facilities plan is being implemented, and they are generally working diligently with practical research. Other elementary schools that are responsible for experimental work that have not been inspected must also have excellent selections. However, the establishment of experimental elementary schools and attached elementary schools are all responsible for guiding local elementary schools. In addition to general research, it is appropriate to investigate the actual problems of local elementary schools and also serve as the object of research work. For example, the provincial No. 1 Experimental Elementary School has already implemented the guidance of local elementary schools in various counties, so it should first focus on the improvement methods of the complete elementary schools in various counties. The nearby experimental elementary schools and attached elementary schools do not need to study the same problems as that school. For example, the attached elementary school of the Jinan Women's Normal School has a foundation for compiling teaching materials, so other schools do not need to gather together to compile their own teaching materials. They can choose other work to contribute. Currently, the elementary schools in Jinan City and the suburbs are compiling their own teaching materials, which has become a fashion of the time. If they intend to win, the drawbacks of partial and incomplete omissions will be difficult to avoid. Educational problems are very broad, so it is appropriate to correct the wind of general agreement and hope to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation.</p>
<p>(11) The two manufacturing plants for instruments and specimens established by the department have not been open for long, but the results are remarkable. Now, the scientific equipment that elementary schools should have does not need to be purchased from Tianjin or Shanghai. In addition, they are cheap and of good quality, and easy to popularize, which is truly commendable. However, the two plants are only set up with 6,000 yuan, and the factory equipment is still largely incomplete and should be expanded at any time.</p>
<p>(12) This year, secondary schools and above are concentrated in the military department, with strict discipline and vigorous spirit, and the handling is quite successful. In addition, they can explain the matters of discipline and service to the students in detail, and sit back and reap the benefits of subtle influence, which is in line with the principles of education and is permissible.</p>
<p>(13) The provincial No. 1 and No. 2 People's Education Guidance Zones are handled with great spirit, and their central undertakings have achieved considerable results. Qu Zhenqian, director of the No. 1 People's Education Guidance Zone, and Yang Yixin, director of the No. 2 People's Education Guidance Zone, are both conscientious and do not avoid hardship. They should be commended as an encouragement.</p>
<p>(14) The Provincial People's Experimental School is located in Jinan City, and due to environmental factors, it has little practical effect. It should be moved to Weixian, where industry is growing, to select a more moderate location and establish contact with factories and society to continue operating.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Department of Education Investigates the Number of Middle and Elementary School Graduates</h3>
<p>Orders to the Education Bureaus of Each County to Report</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education urgently needs to investigate the number of graduates from middle and elementary schools in various counties in the 24th year in order to compile statistics. Therefore, it has drafted (1) a statistical table of the number of graduates from secondary schools, (2) a statistical table of the student graduation examinations of secondary normal schools, and (3) an investigation table of the number of elementary school graduates in the county in the 24th year. The department has issued orders to the education bureaus of various counties, including Shanghai, to fill out and report separately, so as to compile them.</p>

<h3>Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Kuwashima, Arrived in Shanghai from Japan Yesterday to Go to Beijing and Convey New Instructions to Kawagoe</h3>
<p>Kuwashima, Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, who was specially sent to China to meet with Ambassador Kawagoe and convey new instructions, arrived in Shanghai yesterday at 3:20 PM on the Japanese ship Nagasaki Maru, accompanied by Secretary Tanoue.

The Japanese Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai also sent armed soldiers to the port to maintain security. After landing, Kuwashima went to the Consulate General to rest due to the fatigue of the journey and refused to meet with Chinese and foreign reporters. He then held consultations at the Consulate General with Vice Admiral Sato, Naval Attache of the Embassy, Major General Kitadoshi, Military Attache, Wakasugi, Councilor and Consul General in Shanghai, Tajiri, and Yoshioka.

He is scheduled to stay in Beijing for two or three days and then return to Shanghai to wait for the ship to return to Japan to report on his mission. Those traveling with him include Secretary Tanoue and Naval Attache Sato.</p>
<p>According to the Domei News Agency, Director of the East Asia Bureau Kuwashima said at the Embassy that he could not disclose the contents of what he brought to Nanjing until he met with Ambassador Kawagoe.

The city's party, government, military, and bureau officials, as well as various cultural organizations, will jointly welcome him at that time. It is reported that after resting in Shanghai, Dai will rush to Beijing to attend the Central Government and National Government's National Day celebrations on the Double Tenth Festival.</p>
<h3>Shallow Water in Hunan Interrupts Navigation</h3>
<p>Ships Arrive at Jinggang and Barges Transfer Cargo, Increasing the Barge Fee by 15%</p>
<p>The shipping route from Shanghai to Changsha, Hunan, is served by regular liners operated by five companies: Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Sanbei, China Merchants, and Nisshin. This year, due to the bumper harvest in Hunan Province, the amount of goods going to and from this route is unprecedented in the past 20 years. Food is the main commodity coming from Changsha, and cotton textiles and sundry goods are the main commodities going from Shanghai. The transportation on the Changsha route has been very developed for each company in the past four months. Now, at a time when cargo transportation is supposed to be congested, the Xiang River suddenly reported a sharp drop in water level. At its highest, the water level reached more than 50 feet, but it has been decreasing day by day in the past month. Recently, it has dropped to a few inches above four feet, and navigation has been obstructed. Yesterday, it dropped even further to three feet and eight inches. The Hunan liners of each shipping company have all been blocked because each ship has a draft of more than ten feet for larger ships and six feet even for shallow-water ships. As a result, the Jiangda and Jiangjing ships of the China Merchants Bureau, the Changsha of Taikoo, and the Hongyuan, Hongheng, Hongli, and Hongzhen ships of Sanbei are all unable to reach Changsha from the Xiang River. The navigation route has been interrupted, and cargo transportation has also been hindered. Now, in order to remedy the situation of transportation on the Hunan waterway and to dredge the accumulated goods to and from, each shipping company has decided that each river ship will only open to Jinggang, and then each shipping company will send small motorboats and flat-bottomed barges to Jinggang to pick up and transfer the goods to Changsha. At the same time, goods from Hunan will also be barged to Jinggang and transferred to ships. In addition, starting tomorrow, the shallow-water lotus fee will be increased by 15% across the board, and the Hunan-Changsha route will be maintained with great effort.</p>

<h3>British Taikoo Company Resumes Operations of Suspended Ships</h3>
<p>Heavy Cargo to Nanhua, Taking the Opportunity to Ship Three Ships First</p>
<p>The Nanhua route of the British Taikoo Company is its main route. It has more than 20 regular and irregular ships operating between Shanghai, Shantou, Hong Kong, Xiamen, Guangdong, and also calling at various ports in North China. Before the past half year, due to the decline in cargo transportation and the fact that the shipping in North China was exclusively dominated by Japan, the company's coastal shipping line was severely affected. At that time, it announced the suspension of seven ships on the Nanhua route to reduce losses. Since the unification of the two Guangdong provinces and the abolition of the special tax collected by Chen Jitang, the economy of the two Guangdong provinces has been revived, and the amount of goods going from Shanghai to Nanhua has greatly increased. The three companies have already agreed to increase the water fees from Shanghai to Nanhua by 15%. Recently, due to the increase in outgoing goods, Taikoo Company is taking advantage of this opportunity to resume the operation of the seven ships that have been suspended for half a year. In the past two days, it has first resumed the shipping of the Suiyang and Ganzhou ships to Nanhua to transport goods from Shanghai. Today, it has sent the Chongqing ship to resume service. The other four ships are also in the process of planning and arranging schedules. Once determined, all ships will resume operations.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Industry Sends Personnel to Investigate Company and Business Registration</h3>

<p>The Ministry of Finance has announced that the second and third categories of income tax will be levied from the first of this month. However, the taxation of the first category of business income will be levied from the first day of next year. The Ministry of Industry believes that the tax rate covers all profit-making businesses such as companies, firms, shops, factories, etc. As the registration of companies and businesses is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry, and the Ministry of Finance has requested assistance in advance, it has been decided to send personnel to Shanghai to investigate and register data for the Ministry of Finance's reference.</p>
<h3>Amidst Easing Tensions in Shanghai, A Glimpse of Japanese Military Activity, Japanese Military Posts in Various Places Still Conceal Hidden Dangers, Japanese Military Still Conducting Drills in Hongkou and Zhabei</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng She reports that although the situation in the Zhabei and Hongkou areas has eased on the surface, the Japanese troops who have entered the city have not yet completely withdrawn. The Japanese military posts in Hongkou still exist, and the hidden dangers have not been eliminated. At about 9:30 yesterday morning, two platoons of Japanese troops, about sixty or seventy people, all carrying long guns, marched from the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters on Jiangwan Road, across the Tiantong'an railway tracks, through the Dongbinshan Road intersection, and Tongji Road, and marched into the open space at the end of Huayuan Street and the Tanwu Shipyard behind the 63rd Garden. It seems that the number of Japanese troops stationed there has increased, and at the same time, seven or eight trucks drove there loaded with supplies and returned empty. A Xin Sheng She reporter patrolled the area at about 10:00 yesterday morning and looked out from a high place. At that time, seventy or eighty Japanese soldiers were moving around in the open space, looking very busy. A Japanese soldier was on the lookout platform on the roof of the Tanwu Distillery, holding binoculars to observe. The reporter also saw two Japanese men who looked like plainclothes detectives prowling around Tongji Road, Jiangwan Road, and Hengye Road. This is the situation in the western part of Zhabei. In the eastern part, there are still Japanese military posts at the intersection of Disiwei Road and Qimei Road, the intersection of Tiantong Road, and the Jiaxing Road Bridge. However, Ouyang Road, the Qimei Road and Xiangyan Bridge area are completely devoid of Japanese troops. As for the concession area, there are still Japanese military posts at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Qiujiang Road, the intersection of Laobazi Road and Wusong Road, and Hai'ning Road, where infantry and vehicles are patrolling. It is also reported that a large number of traitors have been found near Shanghai, and hundreds of Korean vagrants have come to Shanghai to participate in activities. Also, at about 9:00 yesterday morning, six or seven hundred Japanese soldiers were conducting drills in Hongkou Garden. However, this is a common occurrence. Before the Japanese sailor incident on the 23rd of last month, Japanese troops often conducted drills there.</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that all Japanese schools in the Hongkou district announced the suspension of classes after the Tian'anmen Incident. Now that the situation has gradually eased, the authorities of the Japanese elementary schools have held a meeting and unanimously announced the formal resumption of classes, and notified the parents of all students to immediately send their children to school. Therefore, all schools, such as Yokohama Bridge Japanese Elementary School and Shigaota Road Sida Road Japanese Girls' School, have formally resumed classes since the day before yesterday. However, the Japanese Marine Corps has added guard posts and patrol teams to protect students when they arrive at and leave school. Sangashima Accountant Pictures (International News Agency)</p>

<h3>Japanese and British Coal Compete Fiercely, Seeking to Dominate Our Coal Industry Market, Domestic Coal Sales Account for Only One-Tenth, Due to Weak Capital and High Transportation Costs</h3>
<p>The dumping of Japanese coal in China is managed by the Mitsui and Mitsubishi trading companies. Their sales base is in major commercial ports such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Qingdao, and Hong Kong. The sales method in the interior is managed by Chinese agents. Therefore, China's coal market is almost in the hands of the Japanese. However, in Shanghai, Australian coal used to have the greatest sales power, but recently, it has also changed greatly, and Fushun coal mined by Japanese merchants has taken the lead. Kailuan coal has been overwhelmed by Fushun coal. The coal mine areas in various parts of North China are mostly mined by foreigners. For example, Kailuan Coal Mine is mined by British merchants, and dozens of major coal mines in Shandong's Fangzi, Yinzhen, Zibo, Jilin's Majiagou and Shisonggang, and Liaoning's Benxi, Fushun, Yantai, and Liaoyang are mined by Japanese merchants. Because the Chinese have weak capital and a harsh environment, the production and market share of the Jingxing, Lincheng, Shimensai, Tongshan, Jiawang, Cixian, Wanping, Pingshan, and Changxing coal mines they have mined have fallen behind. Currently, Fushun coal and other Japanese coal are being dumped heavily in Shanghai. Although British merchants' Kailuan coal is competing with it, Chinese coal is unable to compete. Therefore, it is estimated that Japanese coal such as Fushun accounts for 70% of coal sales in Shanghai, Kailuan coal accounts for 20%, and Chinese coal accounts for only 10%. The reason why Chinese coal cannot compete with Japanese and British coal is that transportation costs are expensive and costs are higher. Therefore, the North China coal market is dominated by Japan, and the coal markets in the provinces along the Yangtze River and the provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong are being competed for by Japanese and British coal. Although the Shanghai Coal Industry Trade Association has a strong patriotic enthusiasm and is actively promoting it, it is unable to do so due to the environment, and the coal production in our country is being manipulated by foreigners, which is a cause for concern.</p>
<h3>Fierce Competition in Sino-European Shipping, Foreign Merchants' Pooling Alliance Breaks Down, Netherlands to Build Three Giant Ships After Japan</h3>
<p>Shanghai Times News Agency reports that the issue of Sino-European shipping is not only a struggle between Britain, Germany, and Japan, but also involves the participation of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>There are more than 400 ships</p>
<p>from various countries belonging to the shipping companies of various countries in Shanghai. At first, they competed for their strengths and competed with each other. Since the implementation of the pooling system, the foreign shipping companies have reluctantly reached an agreement. For the shipment of goods, ships are evenly distributed according to the pooling points. After the implementation of this measure, the German North German Lloyd shipping company's monthly dispatch was reduced from three ships to the current one ship per month, which was the most affected. The company expressed its opposition, but was constrained by other companies and failed.</p>
<p>Recently, the Japanese</p>
<p>International Steamship Company suddenly built a giant ship and joined the Sino-European shipping competition. (The two ships that have sailed before are the Xiangteng Maru and the Yizhi Maru.) It has now decided to build two 10,000-ton giant ships with a speed of 20 nautical miles per hour, which can be added successively within the year, and intends to compete with other countries' postal ships with low water freight. After the announcement of this measure, other shipping companies were quite uneasy. For the sake of competition, merchants such as Germany and Britain have risen up to build ships, and the Shanghai Foreign Merchants' Cargo Pooling Alliance has suddenly broken down.</p>
<p>The Dutch Shipping</p>
<p>Company is now following in the footsteps of Japanese merchants and building three giant ships. Two of them are larger, with a tonnage of 16,000 tons, and one is smaller with a tonnage of 10,000 tons. The speed is 19 nautical miles to 21.5 nautical miles per hour. It is heard that the larger one is being built in Hamburg, Germany, and one is being built in the Netherlands. It is expected to arrive in the Far East in May next year. From then on, there will be another strong enemy in Sino-European shipping.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hankou and Shanghai-Chengdu Ticket Prices Reduced</h3>
<p>Airlines Seek to Develop Business</p>
<p>In order to reduce the burden on passengers and develop business, China National Aviation Corporation has specially reduced the original one-way ticket price from Shanghai to Hankou (National Currency) 120 yuan to National Currency 100 yuan, and the round-trip price from the original 210 yuan to 180 yuan, from October 10 this year. The original one-way ticket price from Shanghai to Chengdu, National Currency 400 yuan, has been reduced to National Currency 380 yuan, and the round-trip ticket price from the original National Currency 720 yuan has been reduced to National Currency 685 yuan, all effective from this year's Double Ten Festival. The Douglas aircraft used on the Shanghai-Hankou and Shanghai-Chengdu routes are stable and comfortable, and have long been known to Chinese and foreigners. Moreover, the long-distance travel from Shanghai to Chengdu only takes eight hours to arrive.</p>
<h3>Pudong Waterworks Project Nears Completion</h3>
<p>Water Supply May Be Opened Next Month</p>
<p>The Pudong Youlong Street Pudong Waterworks established by the Shanghai Xingye Trust Company has completed the construction of the plant building and the installation of internal machinery since construction began. It is currently carrying out the laying of water pipes on various roads. It could have been completed and opened for water supply earlier, but because there are many curved streets in Pudong, the laying project has been quite difficult. The plant is operated by the city and aims to serve the public and citizens, so it continues to proceed regardless of any difficulties. It is now known that the laying of pipelines on various roads of the plant is about to be completed, and it is expected that water supply can be opened in the middle of next month. The water price will be reduced compared to commercial operators.</p>

<h3>County Land Value Tax Issue Closes Yesterday, Decision to Levy This Month, County Magistrate Li Goes to Province to Report</h3>
<p>Li Zhifu, the magistrate of Shanghai County, convened local gentry and leaders from various districts to discuss their opinions on the pilot land value tax at the Daquanfu Restaurant on Zhaojiabang Road yesterday (5th) at noon. The attendees included Qin Yanqi, Tang Fuyin, Shi Ansheng, Yao Huibo, Zhang Fengshan, Peng Yintian, Zhang Jingye, Wu Jingqing, Shi Yangyong, Zhao Qianli, Ge Xiusheng, Xing Zhigang, Wu Shifang, Chen Pinyi, Zhang Wuwu, and 18 others. First, County Magistrate Li reported on the important points of the provincial order to pilot the land value tax and the county's preparations for collecting the land value tax. Then, Wu Shifang, Zhang Fengshan, Ge Xiusheng, Xing Zhigang, and Zhao Qianli reported on the wishes of the people in each district and their opinions on the land value tax. Zhang Fengshan suggested that local people should support the implementation of the land value tax in order to complete local autonomy. The total county tax revenue should not be less than in the past, but the benefits that landowners derive from the land should be sufficient to pay the land tax. The fairness and accuracy of the standard price should be ensured, and adjustments should be made in a timely manner to meet the needs of the situation. Then, Qin Yanqi, Shi Ansheng, Yao Huiquan, Wu Jingqing, Shi Yangyong, and others expressed their opinions. County Magistrate Li also explained the laws and regulations and expressed his opinions after the gentry expressed their opinions. The general points were: (1) to maintain the safety of the revenue budget, (2) to not increase the burden on rural land, and (3) to moderately adjust the tax rate. After joint discussion, it was agreed that the land value tax is one of the land policies set by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and the county should be the first to pilot it this year. The county government will collect it on schedule, and will examine the actual situation. When the second phase of the tax is opened, the standard land price and tax rate will be adjusted to ensure fairness and accuracy. The people and the government will all benefit from the actual benefits. The county magistrate and the local leaders all believed that a satisfactory result had been achieved, so they held a dinner party. County Magistrate Li also hoped that local leaders would persuade the various households to pay taxes on time. However, although the tax collection documents have been rushed, they are still far from being completed. The opening date of the tax will definitely be delayed for a few days. County Magistrate Li returned to the county government to handle everything after the banquet, and went to the province last night to report everything to Chairman Chen and Finance Director Chen.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Cancels Fictitious Price, French Franc Exchange Rate Temporarily Stabilizes, 630 French Francs Equal 100 National Currency, Unless There Are Other Changes, It Will Not Fall Again</h3>
<p>After the French government implemented a new monetary policy to prevent capital outflow and devalued the French franc, international exchange rates changed drastically. Various countries are seeking ways to deal with it separately, and our country's exchange rate against the French franc has also been affected. The Central Bank's foreign exchange listing has been set at a fictitious price of 582 French francs per 100 National Currency since the 28th of last month. Afterwards, it continued to fall, falling to 620 French francs per 100 National Currency last Saturday (3rd), but it was still a fictitious price. Now the French government's French franc devaluation policy has been successful. It is scheduled to reduce tariffs from October 10, and reduce the surtax on our country's imported goods from 15% to 10%. Other countries have also cancelled the surtax. This move aims to realize its free trade policy and has no impact on us. However, according to a reporter from Xin Xin News Agency, at 10:00 a.m. on the 5th, the Central Bank's foreign exchange listing was 630 French francs per 100 National Currency, which was 10 French francs lower than last Saturday. Compared with the 464 French francs per 100 National Currency before the French franc devaluation, the difference is a huge 166 French francs. The "fictitious price" has been cancelled. According to the financial community, if the French government does not take other actions, the current price of the French franc can be temporarily stabilized and will not fall again. The exchange rates of London, New York, Berlin, Japan, Hong Kong, etc. are still normal and have not changed.</p>

<p>Last Meeting of the Office, Sub-Committees Have Taken Over Separately</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Recruiting Team Headquarters Office of the China Aviation Association held its 79th office meeting at 2:00 p.m. on the 3rd.

Chairman's report briefly stated that today is the last meeting of the office. The association has been established for several battles and has received support from compatriots across the country, which is roughly in scale. The Central Government has decided to merge the National Aviation Construction Association and the China Aviation Association in order to concentrate its efforts, and reorganize them into the China Aviation Construction Association. A branch has been established in Shanghai, and the General Association sent personnel to Shanghai on the 1st to take over, and the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Ministry of Finance of the Executive Yuan sent personnel to supervise the handover. The entire former China Aviation Association and the Shanghai City Recruiting Team Headquarters Office were handed over to the branch for safekeeping. The branch started working at the former China Aviation Association's headquarters since the day before yesterday, and has submitted a report to the Ministry for filing and notified it separately. The future work plan will be to start work under the aviation salvation movement. Comrades are collecting aviation salvation funds, and unless there are special circumstances, the civilian shipping industry has changed the collection method, which has already been implemented. Starting from the 1st of this month, the Finance Bureau's various ship donation offices will continue to collect donations, and the grades will be set separately for collection. The original purpose was to reduce the burden on shipowners. It is hoped that more widespread publicity will be carried out so that shipowners can understand and actively contribute. The movement to purchase aircraft for birthday wishes will be expanded and publicized to make all sectors of society pay attention. The deadline for the Chairman's birthday is approaching, and donations should be urged and remitted as soon as possible. All donations from various organizations should be promoted and transferred as soon as possible. Then, secretaries from various overseas departments reported on the situation of the contact, and then discussed many routine cases, and then adjourned the meeting.

In order to commemorate this occasion, the Directorate General of Posts has presented it to the Ministry of Communications for approval to issue commemorative stamps for the 40th anniversary of the opening of the postal service, divided into four types: 2 cents, 5 cents, 25 cents, and 1 yuan. Each type has a different design. It is scheduled to be sold at various post offices from October 10, 1936. When the public purchases them, they can also apply for them to be canceled with the post office date stamp. In order to facilitate collectors to collect them, a commemorative stamp album for the 40th anniversary of the opening of the postal service has been specially printed. It will be sold simultaneously by major post offices. This commemorative stamp album comes with a set of commemorative stamps, which are sold at the face value of the stamps (i.e., 1 yuan, 3 jiao, and 2 fen) and no additional fees will be charged. If you want to paste the stamps in the test album and apply for them to be canceled with the date stamp, you can also do so. The sale of the above commemorative stamps and stamp albums is limited to the end of March 1937. The sale will be stopped after the deadline, but they can still be used to pay postage. From July 1, 1937, they will be abolished and will not be allowed to be used. However, the public who hold these stamps will still be allowed to exchange them for ordinary stamps of the same value at various post offices every month (i.e., from July 1, 1937 to September 30, 1937). This is to inform Director Zha Peilin of the Bureau, September 30.</p>

<h3>Superior Trial Planting of White Cottonseeds</h3>
<p>Improvement Association Actively Promotes</p>
<p>The Zhuanqiao Township Rural Improvement Association previously purchased Jiangyin White Cottonseed cottonseeds and distributed them to members for trial planting. The results showed that Jiangyin White Cottonseed is well suited to the local soil. The resulting cotton bolls are not only abundant but also have thin shells, large cotton fibers, long fibers, small cottonseeds, bright white color, and a high lint percentage. Currently, each mu (unit of area) has yielded about two bales. If the weather remains sunny, each mu can yield more than three bales. Even the poorer-quality ones can yield about five he (unit of volume). Seeing these results, the Association plans to actively promote it outside the association to benefit farmers.</p>
<h3>Shen Xin No. 2 and No. 5 Factories Prepare to Resume Production</h3>
<p>Syndicated Loan Not Yet Secured - Work to Begin After Agreement</p>
<p>Shen Xin Textile Company's Yichang Road No. 2 Factory and Huade Road No. 5 Factory, which have been closed, originally planned to resume operations simultaneously when the new cotton season began this year. However, the two factories remain closed to date. According to a reporter from Dagongshe, the main reason for the failure to resume operations is that the issue of financial assistance from the financial community has not yet been properly discussed. Rong Zongjing is struggling to maintain the operations of Factories No. 1, 6, 7, and 9 in the face of sluggish yarn sales. In reality, he has no capacity to raise substantial funds for Factories No. 2 and 5. Therefore, after several attempts, he managed to obtain the consent of the Bank of China and the Shanghai Bank to form a syndicate to provide loans to assist in the process. However, due to the substantial foreign debts of the two factories in the past, the property collateral has become a problem. Although repeated discussions have been held to resume operations, a concrete plan for syndicated assistance has not yet been finalized. Both parties are continuing to negotiate everything and have found a way forward. The two factories can only schedule a start date once all issues have been negotiated and resolved and the syndicate is formally established and loans are issued.</p>

However, according to a reporter from Xinshengshe who inquired with the Silver and Money Industries Association, the two associations have now separately studied their opinions on income tax and have designated Secretaries-General Lin Kanghou and Qin Xieqing of the two associations to contact each other. It has now been decided that after the two associations have completed their separate studies, a joint meeting will be held to discuss them together and then jointly submit them to the ministry for adoption.</p>

<h3>Huang Butian Sues Zhu Ziyun - Confirming Biological Mother-Daughter Relationship - Willing to Undergo Blood Type Testing with Zhu and Her Daughter - Court Orders Zhu Ziyun to be Summoned for Further Interrogation</h3>
<p>Huang Butian, daughter of the late famous national physician Huang Xiaochu, previously filed a complaint with the Mediation Office of the Special First Court, suing throat specialist and national physician Zhu Ziyun, requesting confirmation that the girl Zhu Amao, raised by Zhu, was born to her and Zhu. The mediation failed, as reported in this newspaper. Huang then retained lawyer Sha Xunxi to formally file a lawsuit against Zhu Ziyun and Zhu Amao to confirm their biological mother-daughter relationship and to order them to cease abusing their rights. The facts of the lawsuit are, in brief: The plaintiff was previously married to Shi Xiugang, while Zhu was a disciple of the plaintiff's father, and therefore they were like siblings. Later, after the plaintiff became a widow, Zhu seduced her, and they had a daughter named Amao (also known as Yuejuan, now 23 years old), who was raised by Zhu. Now Zhu is abusing his rights by not allowing Amao to meet with the plaintiff, so she is requesting confirmation of her biological daughter's identity and an order to cease abusing his rights. The order is to send Zhu Ziyun, Zhu Amao, and the plaintiff to the Zhenru Forensic Institute to test their blood types to determine if they are of the same type, etc. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Gui Yu of the Civil Seventh Division of the Special First Court held a hearing. Zhu Ziyun did not appear because he was seeing patients due to illness and retained lawyer Lu Qi to appear in court to defend him and submit a defense statement. The summons for Zhu Amao was not delivered because Zhu Ziyun refused to accept it. According to Zhu Ziyun's defense statement, he absolutely denied having cohabited with the plaintiff Huang Butian. The daughter Xiao Mao (i.e., Amao) born to the plaintiff was not accepted by the plaintiff's husband's family or her mother's family, so she had no place to go. Therefore, the plaintiff's mother ordered Zhu Ziyun to introduce her to a foster family. Zhu introduced her to his mother-in-law, Ms. Ma, who adopted and raised her to adulthood. Last summer, Xiao Mao fell in love with a Mr. Zhang and married him in early winter. Therefore, the plaintiff's claims are all unfounded rumors and baseless gossip. He also refuted the plaintiff for adding the character "Zhu" to her name and, based on legal principles, requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed, etc. After the lawyers for both parties presented their facts, Judge Gui ordered that Zhu Ziyun and Zhu Amao be summoned for another interrogation at a later date.</p>

<h3>Case of Obstructing Credit Arises After Seizure of Wang BinYan's Property - Zhang Rongpu and Lawyer Lu Xingyuan Sued - For Lu's Newspaper Publication Alleging Wrongdoing by Wang</h3>
<p>Shanghai gentleman Wang Dong, also known as Binyan, mortgaged real estate deeded under the British Certificate No. 552, with Chen Bingqian of a major business serving as the intermediary, and Shen Lianfang serving as the guarantor, to borrow 10,000 taels of silver from the Old Guangdong Bank during the Jiazi Qilu War. When the bank called for repayment, Wang claimed that the funds were used to maintain local order and support the military and provide relief to refugees at the time and should be repaid by the government.  He ignored the request.  Zhang Rongpu, the manager of the bank, retained lawyer Lu Xingyuan to sue him in court, and subsequently, after a three trial judgment, Wang Binyan lost the case. However, there were repeated twists and turns in between.  Not until March of this year did the court execute the seizure of the mortgaged property.  Lu Xingyuan, the representative lawyer of the bank, published an announcement in the Xinwenbao regarding the mortgage dispute, stating: "The case of this bank suing Wang Binyan and Shen Lianfang for the execution of the mortgage was based on the final judgment of the Supreme Court of March 25, 1935, and the Shanghai District Court was petitioned to execute it. The original date for seizing the mortgaged property for compensation was August 10th of last year. Later, for some unknown reason, changes occurred and the matter was suspended.  After this bank repeatedly petitioned the Judicial Yuan, the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the Supreme Court, and the Jiangsu Higher Court to order the Shanghai District Court to expedite enforcement in accordance with the law, after months of delay, the court scheduled the seizure of Wang Binyan's mortgaged property on the 23rd of this month. Unexpectedly, someone claiming to be the 'Zhabei All Circles Relief Association for Wang Binyan Suffering for Public Affairs' convened a meeting without understanding the truth and issued a telegram, intending to overturn the final judgment of the court and delay execution by illegal means, which is quite surprising.  The Supreme Court ruled that Wang Binyan's contract with the Governor of Jiangsu Province and Commissioner for Military Rehabilitation in 1914 was after the establishment of the loan agreement, so the claim that the loan was for maintaining local order and raising military expenses is actually an attempt to imply something else.  We are afraid that all circles will not understand the truth and misunderstand, so we have entrusted your lawyer to publish this announcement on behalf of us to clarify the truth."  Wang Binyan, upon seeing this announcement, believed that the words "attempt to imply something else" were relevant to his reputation and also published an announcement in the Minbao, stating that the total funds advanced by the three groups in those days amounted to 472,312.20 yuan. If it is said that the funds advanced by Binyan were an insinuation, then wouldn't the funds advanced by the other groups also be insinuations? He hoped that the bank would correct the announcement it had published or stop publishing it.  Seeing that it continued to be published, Wang wrote a letter of inquiry, stating, "Please provide evidence that the loan was not used to maintain local order and raise military expenses and announce it to the world so that Binyan cannot escape the crime of deceiving the government and deceiving society. Otherwise, all the consequences of the inability to clear the loans borrowed at that time for maintaining local order and raising military expenses, or the government's wavering commitment to repay, and all losses to Binyan's reputation and property shall be borne by your bank. I hope you will understand and reply clearly."  Since no satisfactory response has been received to date, Wang has now retained lawyers Tu Zhengugao and Shuo to file a criminal self-accusation against Zhang Rongpu of the bank and lawyer Lu Xingyuan, who published the announcement on his behalf, with the First Special District District Court, detailing the facts of the defendant spreading rumors and obstructing his reputation and credit, requesting punishment according to the law, and also attaching a civil lawsuit requesting compensation for his Jiazi military advances of 228,649.70 yuan, because the government has refused to return them after the defendant published the announcement.  He also requested compensation for his personal economic losses of 5,000 yuan per year, calculated over ten years, for a total of 50,000 yuan.  Yesterday afternoon, Judge Dai Rongduo held a hearing. The plaintiff Wang Binyan did not appear in person, and the defendant Zhang Rongpu also did not surrender himself. Only Lu Xingyuan appeared in court. First, he submitted a counterclaim for false accusation, and then he detailed the procedures of his handling of the lawsuit against Wang Binyan and others for failing to redeem the mortgage on behalf of the bank. Finally, he said that Wang Binyan's lawsuit this time was frivolous, hoping to get rich out of thin air, not hesitating to make an issue out of nothing, and could make me lose face. This kind of atmosphere, I have suffered repeatedly. In fact, people come to court to await the judge's judgment of right and wrong. It cannot be considered a loss of face. If I am found guilty, I will have no regrets even if I am beheaded. If I am innocent, I should ask the court to punish the plaintiff for false accusation. Now that Wang has not appeared in court, I assume he is ashamed to face me. I should ask the court to summon the plaintiff and make a fair judgment. Zhang Rongpu has gone to Hong Kong for business and has nothing to do with him at all. The plaintiff's lawyer then submitted the newspaper to the court and stated that the plaintiff would definitely appear in court and was willing to subpoena Zhang Rongpu. The court then ordered that the hearing be adjourned to the afternoon of the 16th of this month for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Remarried Couple Arrested in Yangtze Hotel - First Wife Went to Wei Ya Where Wedding Had Already Been Held - Police Discovered Location and Arrested Them Late at Night - Judge Advises Both Parties to Seek Reconciliation Out of Court</h3>
<p>Liu Guangfa, also known as Buyun, 26 years old, a native of this county, lived in a bungalow at No. 176 Jules Pasteur Road in the French Concession. His family was well-off. On the fourth day of the first lunar month in 1928, he married Chen Lindi (28 years old), also a native of this county, through the introduction of Xu Xinquan and Chen Liangxing. They have been married for nine years and have four children, two of whom have died. There are now one son and one daughter. In January of this year, when Liu worked at the Sino-American Hospital in the French Concession, he met Shen Huizhen (also known as Cizhen, 18 years old), a nurse from Shanghai, who lived at No. 14 Yuanfuli, No. 544 Xinzha Road. In February, Liu changed jobs to the Maichang Hospital on Wuzhou Road, and he and Shen had an affair. Since then, Shen became pregnant, and she is now six or seven months along and will soon give birth. Therefore, they discussed getting married and decided to hold the wedding at the Wei Ya Restaurant on Fuzhou Road on the 4th of this month. On the 3rd of the month, Liu asked his wife Chen for a divorce or separation, but she refused and they parted unhappily. At that time, Liu did not mention that he was going to marry Shen the next day. Liu did not return home that night. Unexpectedly, Chen learned of the wedding and rushed to Wei Ya at about 6:00 PM the day before yesterday. However, the wedding of Liu and Shen had already been completed at 4:00 PM, and all the guests had left. Chen had no choice but to report to the old police station. After investigation by Chinese Detective Li Shugui and Detective Song Wenqing, they learned that Liu and Shen had opened a room at No. 231 Yangtze Hotel as their honeymoon suite. They then went there with French Detective Huo Gengsheng at 2:00 AM and arrested Liu and Shen together. They were taken back to the police station along with a wedding certificate and temporarily detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal First Division of the Special First Court. Criminal Presiding Judge Qian Hongye interrogated them. Lawyer Ru Baozhi of the police station stated the facts and prosecuted them for bigamy under Article 237 of the Criminal Law. Then Chen Lindi identified Liu and asked him, Liu Xianfa, to confess that he had committed bigamy with Shen Huizhen and claimed that he had obtained the consent of his wife Chen and that they had met. Shen Huizhen confessed that she had married Liu, which was true, but she did not know that he already had a wife. Liu also retained lawyer Jiang Yiping to defend him. Judge Qian verified the confessions and ordered both parties to seek reconciliation out of court. He then ordered the case to be adjourned, and Liu and Shen were each granted bail of 300 yuan in cash or a guarantor from a store.</p>

<h3>A Mutiny of the Sijiao Mountain Defense Corps: One Soldier Arrested, Li Jilong Hiding in Shanghai, Chongming County Requests Assistance in Apprehension</h3>
<p>Sijiao Mountain, located in Zhejiang waters, is under the jurisdiction of the Chongming County government in Jiangsu Province and is designated as the Fifth District. Xu Yunming, a native of Chongming, was appointed district chief by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs. Shen Ranya, a native of Qidong, was appointed head of the defense corps by the county government, stationed on the island to protect the residents. In early July of this year, during the handover of district chief and defense corps detachment leaders on the island, for unknown reasons, the Anhui and Shandong factions of the defense corps suddenly mutinied. On the night of July 4th, they killed the district chief and the defense corps detachment leader. They seized thirty-six rifles, more than ten Mauser pistols, and three Browning pistols, extorting three thousand gold pieces from local gentry before fleeing by boat. The Chongming County government, upon receiving the report, ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate. It was discovered that the mutinous soldiers hired a small boat to escape after the incident. En route, they encountered a customs officer's boat passing by. Just as the officer was about to inquire, the soldiers cleverly bound two of their companions at the bow of the boat, falsely claiming that they were escorting captured pirates to Nantong for prosecution. Upon hearing that it was official business, the customs officer did not investigate further, allowing them to escape. When the boat reached Wusong, the soldiers discarded the rifles into the Huangpu River and fled ashore with the Mauser pistols and handguns. Recently, it was discovered that Li Jilong, also known as Li Jilong or Li Xingfu, a 34-year-old native of Jinan, Shandong, was among the mutinous soldiers. His brother resides in Wusong. Li was hiding at his brother's place. The Chongming County Public Security Bureau dispatched detectives to inquire with Li's brother, who revealed that Li was hiding at No. 114 Caishi Road in the French Concession of this city. The detectives, together with detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, requested assistance from the French police the day before yesterday. A detective, Liu Jinrong, was dispatched by the police chief to the address and arrested Li Jilong. He was taken back to the police station. Under interrogation, Li confessed to participating in the mutiny on Sijiao Mountain. He was ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 Court. Judge Zhang Chaozuo presided over the hearing. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the Police Department, presented the case, prosecuting him under Articles 271 and 325 of the Criminal Code. Detective Liu Jinrong reported the process of assisting in the arrest of the defendant. According to Zai Chujun, the leader of the Chongming Public Security Bureau's detective team, who surrendered, requested to be transferred. When questioned, the defendant Li Jilong stated, "At the time, I was playing mahjong when they surrounded me, ordering me to call the detachment leader. The detachment leader walked out with me, and after a dozen steps, they opened fire, killing the detachment leader. When asked how much of the three thousand gold pieces extorted he received, he replied, 'I didn't receive a single cent. It was the Anhui gang who mutinied; I am from Shandong.'" After reviewing the statements, the court ruled that the defendant Li Jilong could be temporarily detained and taken away by the Chongming County detectives, with a three-day deadline to submit official documents for his extradition.</p>
<h3>Ant Society Expansion Drive</h3>
<p>The Ant Society, known for its dedication to cultural endeavors, whose projects originally included the Ant Library, the Ant Theater Troupe, the Ant Tutoring School, and the Ant Monthly, has resolved to establish a national Ant Library network after the recent annual general meeting, to promote the society's unconditional book lending program. The society's work is developing rapidly, and thus, the need for talent and financial resources is extremely urgent. Therefore, according to the one-year plan passed by the general meeting, Gao Enming, Ding Xibao, Zhao Jiabin, Ge Jianren, He Ju, and others have been appointed to form a solicitation committee, enlisting enthusiastic members to expand the solicitation.

<h3>Collapse of a Portuguese-Owned Silver Company Due to Poor Reputation and Slow Business</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Jidai Silver Company, located at No. 150 Guangdong Road, was established last April with funding from Portuguese national Remetes and registered at the Portuguese Consulate. Its business activities were ostensibly described as organizing bidding clubs and savings clubs. However, the bidding clubs were essentially the same as lending money at high interest rates, and the savings clubs were a variation of the Wan Guo Sino-French Savings Society. The company's business targeted the hard-earned money of the working class, employing extremely ruthless methods. The Social Affairs Bureau and other agencies were paying close attention, but due to its Portuguese ownership, they were unable to take action. Recently, the company suddenly ceased operations. It is understood that the company suffered from a poor reputation, resulting in very slow business since its opening, and its limited capital was insufficient for turnover. It collapsed a few days ago.</p>

<h3>In Divorce Case, Husband Suspected of Having a Venereal Disease; Sent for Medical Examination</h3>
<p>Wei Aijuan, a 21-year-old woman from Suzhou, residing at No. 33, Shunxing Lane, Baike Road, recently filed for divorce from her husband, Lu Zhonglv, through lawyer Huang Xiubo at the local court. She claimed that she had only married Lu Zhonglv, a native of Shangyu (residing at No. 35, Xing'an Lane, Lujiabang), in April of this year. However, her husband was of bad character, had an affair, turned to violence when she advised him against it, and contracted syphilis, which was difficult to cure. Therefore, after only two months of marriage, it was difficult to stay together, and she requested a divorce. The defendant, Lu Zhonglv, retained lawyer Chen Rui, who argued that the accusations were completely fabricated and that his wife sought a divorce because he did not provide financial support to her mother. He presented a certificate from the Health Bureau proving that he did not have syphilis and requested that the court order them to live together. However, the plaintiff's lawyer insisted that he had a venereal disease. Judge Zhang ordered Lu to be sent for a medical examination and scheduled the next hearing for the 7th of this month.</p>

<p>On the first of this month, Zhang Mingqin, the director of the Pudong Public Security Branch Bureau, received a secret report stating that a certain person from Shaoxing was secretly running a large-scale gambling den near Tongxing Street in Yangjiazhai. As the report lacked a detailed address, Director Zhang could not make an arrest. He secretly dispatched officers Ye Shouchun and Huang Youfen, a household registration officer, who spent two to three days investigating before finally discovering that the gambling den was located inside No. 61, Maoye Lane. On the evening before last, at around 9 PM, officers Ye and Huang, along with senior police officers, surrounded the front and back doors of the gambling den and arrested twenty-three gamblers inside: Wang Shunfa, Chen San, Wang Wenbin, Hu Axiang, Qiu Heqing, Zhang Awu, Song Wuyan, Chen Wenkui, Wang Agen, Wang Qingxiang, Ye Xing, Zhu Amao, Yang Caibing, Chen Changfa, Sun Fugen, Shao Axun, Lu Guiying, Wang Jinchu, Dong Shunxing, Ye Boying, Han Jinguang, Shu Afa, and Ye Wenyuan, all from Shaoxing.

<h3>Grand Opening of the Huxi Domestic Goods Department Store Yesterday; Liang Sisters Cut the Ribbon; Citizens Enthusiastically Visit</h3>
<p>The Huxi Domestic Currency Department Store held its grand opening ceremony yesterday afternoon. Liang Saizhen cut the ribbon, and Liang Saishan unveiled the plaque.</p>
<p>Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, the department store held its opening ceremony on Carter Road. Attendees included actresses Liang Saizhen and Liang Saishan, Cao Zhigong of the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession, Zhang Yichen of the National Physical Education Association, Liu Zhongying of the Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association, Chen Jiufeng of the Leather Goods Industry Association, Hu Fengxiang of the First Special District Citizens Federation, Ge Futian of the Nantong Fellow-Villagers Association, and approximately two hundred others, chaired by Xie Baosheng.</p>
<p>Ribbon Cutting and Unveiling</p>
<p>After the ceremonial rites, the chairman accompanied the Liang sisters as they cut the red and green ribbons at the entrance to the strains of music. Then, Liang Saishan pulled back the curtain covering the main entrance, unveiling the plaque. The crowd entered in droves amidst thunderous applause, and participating manufacturers began their business at that moment.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>The opening ceremony was then held in the auditorium. Chairman Xie Baosheng reported, "Distinguished guests, comrades, we are extremely honored to have you attend the opening of this department store today. We are particularly fortunate to have the presence of Misses Liang Saizhen and Liang Saishan, who are presiding over the ribbon-cutting and unveiling ceremonies. In recent years, our country has suffered from the economic invasion of foreign powers, leading to the decline of our domestic industries. Although the industrial and commercial sectors have strived to improve, the lack of discerning ability among the populace has resulted in a failure to reduce the annual surplus of foreign goods. The purpose of this department store exhibition is to provide an opportunity for producers and consumers to jointly promote industry and revive our economy. It is hoped that from now on, the industrial sector will strive to improve manufacturing, and consumers will increase their support of domestic goods."</p>
<p>Declaration</p>
<p>The department store issued a declaration stating, "Our country's material progress lags behind its craftsmanship. As foreign goods are sold alongside domestic products in the market, buyers lack the ability to distinguish between them, or they shift their gaze and happily use foreign goods. Only by centrally promoting domestic goods can we arouse the interest of customers. The area of Huxi is densely populated and vast, and it is urgent to expand as much as possible to meet the needs of all sectors of Huxi, allowing them to purchase nearby. We have specifically created this department store to collect the best domestic products. Please do not underestimate the insignificance of individual purchases. It should be known that 'many hands make light work,' and 'many a little makes a mickle.' If everyone has the same heart and fulfills their patriotic duties, it is not impossible to stem the tide of foreign goods."</p>
<p>Divisional Display</p>
<p>The interior of the department store is divided into more than thirty sections, including silk fabrics, cloth head, camel [unclear character], fashionable coats, boots and shoes, wool textiles, socks, clothing, [unclear character] shirts, water bottles, cosmetics, felt hats, wool yarn, glass products, leather goods, domestic umbrellas, enamelware, ginseng and swallow's nest, lottery tickets, handkerchiefs, native produce, silver shields, miscellaneous goods, stationery, toys, copper and iron beds, snacks, fresh fruits, sweets, wild game, etc. The exhibition will last for six months, and it is planned to set up an entertainment section to enhance the interest of visitors.</p>
<h3>News from Trade Associations</h3>
<p>Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry Association, due to the rampant offering of excessively low bids by fellow businesses, which has disrupted industry regulations, issued a notice to all members yesterday. The original text of the notice is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Notice: It has been reported that recently, fellow businesses have been soliciting dyeing orders from various silk shops and silk and satin foreign goods shops, using a voting-style method to set dyeing prices at excessively low rates. In addition, there are unscrupulous street runners who deliberately offer prices far below cost, in order to undermine business and sow doubt among silk manufacturers, intending to cause disruption. All of these are detrimental to the entire industry's overall dyeing prices and overall business. The impact will only lead to the further decline of our industry to the point of no return. It is necessary to warn against cunning and deceit."</p>
<p>"The association discussed this matter at the 18th Executive Supervisory Committee meeting on the 4th of this month. The consensus was that 'This kind of unfair competition not only destroys business, but also harms oneself and the industry. The malicious intent is extremely regrettable. From now on, if any fellow business solicits orders from the silk industry with excessively low bids through a bidding-style method, causing damage to the standard dyeing prices set by the entire industry, upon investigation and confirmation, the member will be held fully liable for all damages incurred, in accordance with the oath made in their voluntary statement, and will be prosecuted according to law without leniency. As for the silk shops' requests for dyeing price lists, all fellow businesses must first create and submit the lists to the association. After the association reviews them, they may be sent out; otherwise, price discrepancies will cause suspicion and harm the business. Violations of the industry regulations should also be thoroughly investigated."</p>
<p>"The above resolution has been passed. This important notice is hereby recorded, and all members must strictly comply."</p>

<h3>Elementary School Principal Punished for Fraudulent Fundraising: Donating in the Name of the Shicai Association; Fined One Hundred Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chengji Shicai Charity Association previously raised funds from all walks of life for the purpose of providing coffins. Its address was located at No. 1163, Tonghe Lane, Wuding Road. However, the charity association closed down the year before last, and all documents, seals, origins, etc., were kept by Peng Kangnian, a member of the association from Suzhou. Peng opened the Huimeng Elementary School at No. 49, Lane 781, Xinzha Road, and served as its principal. However, starting in April of this year, Peng suddenly had malicious intentions and continued to use the name of the Chengji Shicai Charity Association, assigning Jiang Jinqing, a former member of the association from Changzhou, to solicit donations from businesses with a donation book. The proceeds were split between them. At around 10 AM the day before yesterday, Jiang went to the home of Wang Shiqing at No. 26, Taili Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, to solicit donations. Wang agreed to donate one yuan, but he needed to check with the association to verify its authenticity. Unexpectedly, Jiang fled, and Wang reported this to Chinese Constable No. 1735, who took Jiang, along with the donation book, receipt, origin, newspaper, etc., to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Under investigation by Chinese Detective Wang Wenbin, Peng Kangnian was subsequently arrested at the Huimeng Elementary School on Xinzha Road, and seven seals were confiscated and taken back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted them for fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Code and presented the above circumstances. Jiang Jinqing admitted to soliciting donations on Peng's orders and that he had collected more than thirty yuan from April to the present, of which he gave Peng more than ten yuan. Peng Kangnian denied conspiring with Jiang, making evasive statements, and retained a lawyer to defend him. After verifying the statements, Judge Pan Zhenyang sentenced Jiang Jinqing and Peng Kangnian to joint continuous fraud, with a fine of one hundred yuan each. If they were to serve labor service, it would be calculated at two yuan per day. The receipts and seals were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Performing Artist Accused of Abusing Female Apprentice</h3>
<p>Beiping - Wu Gong performing artist Zhang Debing, stage name Gaitianhong, age 22, recently came to Shanghai from Jiangxi after his troupe disbanded, residing at 40 Baokang Lane, Avenue Joffre, French Concession. Zhang married Wu, a Shaoxing woman (18 years old this year), two years ago. In October of last year, through introductions from his wife's family, he took in Wang Huahua, a 12-year-old girl from Lanxi, as his apprentice, teaching her Wu Gong opera arts. During training, beatings with sticks and hands were unavoidable. Zhang's wife, Wu, young and quick-tempered, also frequently beat the girl, causing discontent among the neighbors. The French police received a report letter the day before, alleging Zhang's abuse of his female apprentice. Detective Zhou Ruiyuan was dispatched to investigate and found bruises on both sides of the girl Wang Huahua's cheeks and soreness in her right arm, confirming the assault. Zhang was arrested and, along with the girl, taken back to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special District, where Judge Zhang Chaozuo presided over the hearing. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer representing the police department, presented the case and requested an extension for further investigation before proceeding with the trial. Subsequently, the girl Wang Huahua testified that her master usually treated her well, and only lightly disciplined her when she didn't perform well in training. However, she stated that her mistress was very fierce and often beat her. She said she did not want to report on her master but wanted her mistress to be investigated. Questioned, the defendant Zhang Debing denied the abuse and beatings. Zhang's wife, Wu, was listening outside the court and was summoned for questioning. She admitted to occasionally scolding and hitting the girl for breaking bowls and dishes. The court reviewed the testimonies and adjourned the hearing to the 12th for further investigation, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Xu Bokang Arrested for Concealing Opium</h3>
<p>Xu Bokang, a grain merchant from Wuxi, residing at 22 Zhujiaqiao, French Concession, was found at 4:30 PM the day before, concealing seven packages of opium, totaling six and a half taels. He was riding the No. 18 trolleybus when, near the intersection of Dongyouheng Road and Zhaofeng Road, he was stopped by Chinese detectives Lin Aizhong and Xu Bingnan of the Huishan Police Department, along with Chinese constable No. 2051, who found his behavior suspicious and arrested him. Xu claimed that the opium belonged to Yuan Shisheng, residing at 42 Kaifeng Road, who had asked him to deliver it to 30, Lane 783, Zhoujiajui Road. The detectives rushed to Kaifeng Road but couldn't find Yuan. They then went to 30 Anle Lane, Zhoujiajui Road, and apprehended two Ningbo men, Lin Yunzhang, and Anhui man, Zhu Huazai, who were consuming opium, along with their opium paraphernalia. All were taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian presented the case and requested an investigation. Detective Sun then reported the details of the arrest and presented the evidence. Questioned, Xu Bokang confessed that a friend, Lin Genbao, had asked him to deliver the opium in a "triangular" trade, offering vague explanations and begging for leniency. The two defendants, Lin and Zhu, denied knowing Xu and claimed to have quit opium a long time ago. Judge Zhan ordered them to be remanded in custody, pending sentencing.</p>
<h3>Caojiadu Police Station Arrests Gambling Syndicate Members</h3>
<p>Wang Zhenxin, 36 years old from Nanxiang, residing at 41 Xin Gongyi Lane, Rue de Zikawei, Shanghai West, specialized in running "flower society" betting dens in the Shanghai West area, enticing people to gamble. Recently, due to carelessness, his activities were discovered by Inspector Liu Pei of the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau. Inspector Liu, along with Inspector Li, led police officers to the location quietly. They arrested Wang on the spot and confiscated numerous "flower society" ledgers, betting slips, and gambling funds. During questioning, Wang confessed and revealed that his betting den was located at 76 Cunshan Lane on the same road. The police then dispatched detective squad leader Xu Jintang and detectives Zhao Jinhui, Li Bingsen, and Li Pinquan to arrest Li Xu's, Weng Jingeng, and Huang Furu, who were also taken into custody for questioning. Wang confessed without hesitation, while Li and the others denied any knowledge. The bureau deemed Wang and his accomplices to be extremely unlawful in establishing "flower society" betting dens to swindle money. They prepared a document to be sent to the main bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Partner Flees After Failure, Court Orders Arrest of Ji Yi</h3>
<p>Ji Yi, a lawyer from Anhui who had withdrawn from the bar association, was recently sued in the Second Special District Court by Wang Zhenhua, a former county magistrate, who hired a lawyer to claim that Ji Yi had defrauded him of 1,500 yuan last winter under the guise of a joint speculative venture. Based on the complaint, the court, presided over by Judge Sun Pengxian, summoned Ji Yi and ordered him to provide a guarantor who would ensure his appearance. Ji Yi's younger brother, Ji Qizong, persuaded Gao Yaozhang, a Suzhou native residing at 9 Liuxian Village, Avenue du Maréchal Joffre, to entrust Chen Yifei, the owner of Tianle Tailor Shop at 2 Yushun Lane, Dongxin Bridge Street, to vouch for Ji Yi for 15 days, falsely claiming that Ji Yi was involved in a fight. Chen, being illiterate, rashly agreed and provided a written guarantee. However, after Ji Yi was released on bail, he claimed illness and disappeared without a trace. Chen Yifei learned that Ji Yi was charged with fraud and requested the withdrawal of his guarantee. The Second Special District Court transferred the case to the prosecutor's office and detained Gao and Chen for questioning, ordering them to provide Ji Yi. This matter has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun again presided over the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. Wang Zhenhua accused Ji Yi of fraud, but the defendant was absent. The court ordered the arrest of Ji Yi for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Driver's Bestial Act</h3>
<p>Du Jinxiang, a police officer at post No. 33, Xinkou, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, was approached at around 10 AM yesterday by Shen Shaofu, a resident of the area, who accused Liu Baohua of raping his ten-year-old daughter, causing injuries and bleeding. Shen also presented several bloodstained pairs of pants. Police Officer Du arrested the accused and, along with the victim, took them to the Zhongxing Road Police Station. Inspector Xie Zhong conducted the investigation. Shen Shaofu, 33 years old from Chongming, residing at the rear building of 12 Tongxing Lane, Qiujiang Road, and working as a rickshaw puller, stated that his twelve-year-old daughter, Mao Nv, was currently studying at a nearby primary school. On the morning of the first of this month, at around 7 AM, Shen had left to pull his rickshaw, and Mao Nv was still asleep in the room. Liu Baohua, a friend living in the front building, snuck into the room and raped Mao Nv, causing injuries and incessant bleeding. Initially, Shen suspected it was her menstruation but, realizing the situation was wrong, he forced his daughter to reveal the truth and arrested the accused, presenting the bloodstained pants as evidence, requesting severe punishment, adding that Liu Baohua was also a friend. Shen Mao Nv testified that she was thirteen years old and currently attending school. Liu Baohua covered her mouth to prevent her from making noise and removed her lower clothing. She was unable to resist and was violated. Her lower body was swollen and bleeding incessantly. She was still asleep at the time, and no one was upstairs. The door was also tightly closed by Liu, so she was helpless and had to endure the act. Liu Baohua, 33 years old from Haimen, admitted to being a friend of Shen Shaofu and also working in the same trade, pulling a rickshaw at Zifeng Money Exchange, 240 Ningbo Road, but was evasive about the rest. After reviewing the testimonies, the interrogating officer immediately reported the case to the Xinzha Sub-bureau. The bureau, deeming the case to involve the rape of a minor, ordered it to be transferred to the Public Security Bureau. It was learned that the Public Security Bureau had taken custody of the suspect at around 5 PM yesterday for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Fire at Tiediqiao, Pudong</h3>
<p>Two rooms rented by a Zhang from Chongming, without a street number, at Tiediqiao, Pudong, caught fire yesterday morning around 11 AM when Zhang was cooking. The fire quickly spread, and the family escaped in haste. Another three tenants were living in the house, Fan Wu (55 years old) from Tiantai, making a living by farming. He had returned from the field in the morning, had breakfast, and was fast asleep. He woke up screaming when the flames touched him. At that moment, the Pudong Fire Brigade was returning from putting out a fire in a thatched hut in Yangjia, north of Tiediqiao, which fortunately did not cause significant damage. Seeing the fire at Tiediqiao, they rushed to the scene. Firefighters braved the flames and rescued Fan Wu, who was severely burned, with skin peeling off, hair charred, and face lacerated, unconscious. He was rushed to Pudong Hospital, where his condition was critical. The two thatched huts were reduced to ashes in an instant. The Zhang family, fearing punishment, fled without a trace.</p>

<h3>Steamed Bun and Pancake Factory Planned - Survey of Over Two Hundred Shops - Fundraising in Progress</h3>
<p>According to Guomin She, most working-class people in this city have limited income, and their main food consists of steamed buns and pancakes. There are no fewer than three hundred shops in the city selling these foods, but the production and operation are highly unreasonable. The sales scope has been decreasing, lacking a balanced adjustment mechanism. Furthermore, due to inefficient methods, they cannot handle large-scale business, and after being exploited, they can hardly survive. To rescue the situation and improve this business, a centralized steamed bun and pancake factory is planned for the entire city. The plan aims to rationalize production and operation, improve the quality of products, help most shops reduce losses, and expand the sales of these foods. A survey has been conducted among over two hundred existing shops in the city, soliciting their opinions, and they all support the idea. Fundraising is now actively underway, and the factory is expected to be established in the shortest possible time. Anyone wishing to know more about this detailed plan or to discuss it should contact Mr. Hai Bibo directly at 232 Po Sai Road.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping for Ransom - Criminals Fall Into Their Own Trap - Kidnapping First, Demanding Money Later - One Detained and Confessed</h3>
<p>Recently, a type of child kidnapping case resembling kidnapping for ransom has occurred in this city, and several cases have been solved. Yesterday afternoon at 6 PM, Luo Chaowei, a Danyang native (residing at 11 Huaxin Road, Zhabei), reported that his seven-year-old daughter, Kouzi, had been kidnapped several days ago and was missing. He had reported it to the Mongol Road Police Station. Yesterday morning, Inspector Xuan Shan of the Tianbao Lane Police Station received a report from the family that Xu Guozhen had claimed to know Kouzi's whereabouts. If the girl was to be returned home, several tens of dollars would need to be paid, which he could assist with. The man was detained and confessed that the girl had been kidnapped and hidden for ransom by Zang Jinsheng, a Danyang native (35 years old, residing at 65 Shipin Lane, inside the city). Inspector Xuan then took the suspect Xu to the Lao Beimen Police Station, requesting police chief Zhang Xiangshang to go to the address and arrest the kidnapper Zang Jinsheng. Zang confessed to the kidnapping, stating that the kidnapped girl, Kouzi, was hidden in Danyang. He was handed over to the investigating officers to be dealt with.</p>

<h3>Securities Forward Government Bonds Experience a Stronger Downturn</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange market was extremely volatile, and people were also very uneasy. Mr. Sangshima's arrival in China has already led to a hurried transfer from Shanghai to Beijing. The negotiations with Japan seem to be reaching the final stage. Opinions differ, and it is difficult to grasp whether the news is positive or negative. Although the market appears tight, it cannot withstand the impact of rumors. Although the situation feels tense, it is all demonstrative action. The future of the market is likely to see a larger range of fluctuation. Yesterday, the market opened in the morning with prices still tight. Category D rose sharply by about ten cents, while the rest were up by a small five cents to three cents. Sellers were mostly offering November and 16 bonds, while buyers were most eager for number 4. When the market opened in the afternoon, numbers 5 and 51 were also being sold. Except for categories 1 and 2, which remained slightly firm by five cents, most others continued to decline by a small five cents to a dime or two and a half cents. At closing, there were some unfounded rumors, and retail investors sold heavily, causing a further decline of five cents to a dime or three cents. Since the currency reform, the foundation of government bonds has become more solid than before. Therefore, although the number of chips has increased significantly, market price fluctuations have been less severe than before because government bonds are equivalent to legal tender. Yesterday's market price results showed that Categories E, D, and C rose slightly, from five cents to three and a half cents, while the long-term Category C fell slightly by two cents, and Category A plummeted by as much as fifty-five cents. The total trading volume was 12,490,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Sales to Sichuan are Strong</h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned firmer, and the situation is rising again. The situation has eased and short positions have been covered. At the same time, the spot yarn supply is still tight and sales to Sichuan have improved. As a result, people's confidence has recovered and the market has turned from decline to briskness. However, it has been found that various parties have handled 40,000 to 50,000 bales, of which November futures yarn accounts for 20,000 bales. The future situation is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Long Positions in Futures Yarn Increase Their Bets</p>
<p>At the opening of the futures yarn market, all months rose in unison. Due to the easing of the situation and the stabilization of people's sentiment, there was a lack of sellers in the market, and the momentum became tighter. The second round was slightly weaker. By the third round, large players were covering short positions and gold firms were increasing their long positions. At the same time, sales to Sichuan Province were active, and the market atmosphere suddenly became tense. Market prices then moved forward. It was found that Yu Da, De Da, Ming De, Shen Ji, Tai Chang, and Run Kang were selling, while Geng Feng, Xing Chang, Da Chang Cheng, and Tong He were buying heavily. As a result, all months rose by 1.50 to 2 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. At the opening in the afternoon, it was heard that yarn sales to Sichuan Province were strong, people's sentiment was high, and the market rose sharply. As a result, near-month prices rose 25 cents compared to the morning closing price, while far-month prices fell 10 cents. It was found that Yu Da sold 5,900 bales, De Da 1,510 bales, Ju Xing 1,400 bales, Shen Ji 1,150 bales, Tai Chang 2,450 bales, Run Kang 1,100 bales, and Xie Cheng 1,300 bales. On the buying side, Zhen Da bought 1,500 bales, Geng Feng 5,650 bales, Xing Chang 4,000 bales, Da Chang Cheng 4,250 bales, Chang Feng 1,650 bales, Tong He 2,150 bales, Tong Ji 1,300 bales, and Heng Yi 1,300 bales. A comparison of the highest and lowest prices for the day is shown below.</p>
<p>Futures Yarn　Highest Price　Lowest Price　Closing Price　Compared to Previous Day　Inventory</p>
<p>October　206.8　205.1　206.6　Up 1.50　108,450</p>
<p>November　206.0　204.5　205.9　Up 2.20　179,150</p>
<p>December　205.9　204.4　205.7　Up 1.90　250,850</p>

<p>March　206.9　205.6　206.6　Up 1.50　14,100</p>
<p>Total　884,100</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Transactions Exceed 3,000 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are strong. It has been found that various firms bought a total of 3,175 bales throughout the day, with prices rising by 1 yuan. The purchase amounts of various firms are as follows:</p>
<p>Sichuan　2,360　Hankou　25</p>
<p>Yunnan　20　Guangdong　95</p>
<p>Jiangxi　50　Nanjing　20</p>
<p>Changsha　200　Inland　315</p>
<p>Wuhu　30　Shantou　20</p>
<p>Futures Cotton Sees Significant Short Covering</p>
<p>Cotton cloth prices rebounded due to the good yarn market and significant short covering, which dried up the market. Market prices gradually rose. However, the overseas cotton market is trending softer.</p>
<p>Cotton Prices Rise Gradually</p>
<p>At the opening of the futures cotton market, because U.S. cotton continued to fall by 6 to 8 points and Indian cotton was also sluggish, with Osaka Three-Product cotton falling by 2.3 yuan, the market was mediocre, with each month rising slightly by 5 to 10 cents. Unexpectedly, in the second round, due to the rise in the yarn market, Feng Jin Chang suddenly came in to purchase in bulk, and supply was temporarily unable to meet demand. Market prices suddenly jumped up by 35 cents. The situation remained good until the third closing, with prices continuing to rise by 5 to 10 cents. Sellers Yi Kang, Yu Da, Chang Feng, Run Kang, Feng Tai, Yi Chang, Chang He, and Da Fu all sold in small quantities. Only Feng Jin bought more than 21,000 dan, and Jin Chang also purchased more than 11,000 dan. Da Chang Cheng, Jin Chang, Xing Chang, and Da also covered short positions significantly. As a result, prices for all months rose by 30 to 45 cents compared to the previous day's closing price. At the opening in the afternoon, the near-month prices were flat, but the far-month prices were still good. There was not much change in the second and third rounds, but the momentum was very tight due to large players covering short positions. The closing was particularly firm. As a result, prices for all months rose again by 10 to 20 cents compared to the morning closing price, with the near month falling by 5 cents. It was found that Chang Feng sold 12,200 dan, Yi Chang 5,400 dan, Run Kang 3,000 dan, Xin Cheng 4,200 dan, Feng Tai 2,500 dan, Da Kang 2,300 dan, Yuan Da 3,900 dan, Yu Da 6,300 dan, Ju 3,100 dan, Chang He 12,600 dan, Yi Kang 2,400 dan, and Hua Mao 2,000 dan.

<p>Indian Cotton Crop Feared to Be Quite Smooth</p>
<p>The market trend was quite firm last week due to the devaluation of the French franc, which sparked speculative interest. However, most transactions were speculative in nature. Before the U.S. cotton next government report is released, it may trigger long liquidation. Export inquiries are peaceful. Japan is buying new cotton. On the mainland side, interest is weak due to financial instability. The cotton harvest is generally smooth. Only the Broach cotton crop is slightly below the annual average. The attached statistics for last week are as follows (unit: 1,000 bales).</p>
<p>According to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast on the 5th was: Broach 220 rupees, up 1 rupee; Oomra 198 rupees, up 1.5 rupees; Pingal 157 rupees, up 0.75 rupees.</p>
<h3>Private US Cotton Estimates Reported Increase</h3>
<p>A New York telegram dated the 3rd stated that the Pinnate Company's estimate for the current new cotton crop is 54.3% for production, with a yield of 11,331,000 bales, an increase of 151,000 bales compared to the previous estimate (August 29).</p>
<p>Three-Product Yarn and Cotton Prices Fluctuate in Osaka</p>
<p>An Osaka telegram dated the 5th stated that three-product futures yarn fell 6 cents to 1.80 yuan, with the near month at 213.60 yuan and the far month at 206 yuan. Futures cotton rose 10 cents to a drop of 6 cents, with the near month at 66.65 yuan and the far month at 66.30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Spot Cotton Cloth Demand is Extremely Urgent Raw Materials, Yarn and Thread are Insufficient, and Factory Shipments are Greatly Reduced</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market strengthened as the situation eased slightly. Futures yarn and cotton rose sharply due to active spot sales, and the cotton cloth market also rose firmly. Eastern fine cloth and fine twill prices increased by 5 cents per piece. Local factory fine cloth and fine twill also rose by 5 to 10 cents. Light-weight coarse cloth and coarse twill sales were as usual, while heavy-weight coarse cloth and coarse twill were the most popular, rising by 10 to 20 cents per piece. The sales of fancy goods were similar to those at the end of last week, but spot goods became increasingly tight, due to the extremely urgent demand in the market and the insufficient supply of gray cloth and raw materials, yarn, and thread. Unbleached fine cloth and coarse cloth were also uniformly lacking in spot goods. For example, heavy-weight 16-pound coarse cloth originally had more than 20 brands to sell, but now it has been reduced to 6 or 7 brands, and spot goods are still being delivered sporadically. This shows the scarcity of production. Yesterday, the delivery of printed flannel, thread, and tribute drill was the most prosperous, all of which were goods dispatched by various factories on the same day. Although the market is gradually rising, new customer transactions are becoming increasingly active, and people's sentiment is very excited, especially in Sichuan, Yunnan, Fujian, and Guangdong.</p>
<h3>Melton Market Condition Exceeds Flat Thick Cloth</h3>
<p>The trend of Melton cloth has been getting better recently, and customers from near and far are making purchases. This is because 60-70% of military, government, and school uniforms are made of this cloth, but arrivals are thin and inventories are lacking. There is a strong sense that the market will get better as prices rise, and its trend has exceeded that of flat, thick cloth. Yesterday, high-end Melton cloth was sold in batches at 3.85 yuan per yard, and the lowest-grade, basic goods were sold in batches at 2.25 yuan per yard for the whole box.</p>
<h3>Grains Tianjin Merchants Actively Purchase Flour, All Months See New Records</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, prices in the morning showed an initial flat trend, followed by continued strong increases in all months. The quoted prices for foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada continued to be good, rising about 20 to 30 cents. However, when prices opened, people's sentiment was still stable. Then, because Tianjin flour sales were strong (with recent sales of 70,000 to 80,000 units), and prices were also rising, people's sentiment gradually improved and transactions became very active. The closing prices for each month of the week were up by 3 to 4 cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, the momentum became even more severe. January and February prices were all above 50 cents. The highest price for the March contract even reached 3.60 yuan (all months setting new records). Transactions were very active. After the closing, this month's prices were also high, at 35 and a half cents. However, as the upward trend became strong, large long positions closed positions for profit, so the market gradually calmed down. The current upward trend is mainly due to the initial active purchasing by Tianjin merchants, but ultimately it is still because foreign wheat is not easily accessible.</p>

<h3>It is Said that the Wheat Market's Rising Trend is Not Yet Over</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market opened in the morning with prices consistently firm across all months. Because foreign wheat quotations continued to improve by 20 to 30 cents, the market sentiment was stable. Opening prices for each month were better by 30 to 50 cents compared to the previous week. However, wheat trading outside the industry was relatively rare, so transactions were not very active. When the market opened in the afternoon, the improved flour market in the morning stimulated the industry's sentiment, and short positions were actively covered. Speculative clients from Beijing also followed suit and bought, and each month rose by 50 to 60 cents compared to the morning. The increase in each month was as high as 110 to 120 cents. Observing subsequent developments, the rising trend may not yet be over. In the spot wheat market, the price of extra high-quality wheat also increased by 10 cents, with Yingzhou Shandong wheat at 5.40 yuan, Hefei wheat at 5.20 yuan, second-grade at 5.19 yuan, Jiangbei wheat at 5.15 yuan, Wuhu wheat at 5.17 yuan, second-grade at 5.05 yuan, third-grade at 5.00 yuan, Huaian wheat at 5.25 yuan, second-grade at 5.20 yuan, Yanghe wheat at 5.35 yuan, second-grade at 5.32 yuan, Yaowan wheat at 5.29 yuan, Suqian wheat at 5.15 yuan, Gaoyou wheat at 5.20 yuan, Nanjing wheat at 5.10 yuan, Fuxin bought 7,000 packages, and Shenda sold 5,000 packages.</p>

<h3>Demand for Ke Xian Rice Increases</h3>
<p>Yesterday, less than 10,000 packages of newly arrived Ke Xian rice were available, but both this street and Shantou and Guangdong had keen demand. Total market transactions exceeded 25,000 packages. In addition, merchants in the producing areas were hoarding, and the number of shipments gradually decreased. River rice had already seen an increase, and foreign wheat was not cost-effective. Therefore, sellers had upward momentum and gradually raised prices. Yesterday, Benke actively purchased, and prices rose sharply by 10 to 20 cents. Guangdong continued to actively purchase brown Ke Xian rice, while Shantou and this street focused on machine-milled rice. North Ocean merchants also transacted a small number of foreign rice, 1,000 packages. Inland and Zhejiang merchants also made small purchases, so the market turned brisk. If Ke merchants continue to buy actively in the future, market prices may need to rise further. Throughout the day, 13,400 packages of Jiangxi rice, 5,200+ packages of Hunan rice, 5,000 packages of Shashi and Hankou brown rice, 660 packages of Zha Xian rice, and 1,000 packages of Xiaojiao rice were shipped.</p>
<h3>Northern Merchants Purchase Seed Rice</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various merchants surged, with a total of nearly 50 firms arriving, carrying over 10,000 piculs of goods. The sales market on this street was also active, with purchases including over 1,000 packages of seed rice from Dalian, Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Qinhuangdao, and Yantai, as well as over 200 packages of thin and broken rice. Therefore, although the arrival of seed rice, Baige, and new glutinous rice was strong, they did not continue to fall, and the market was stable. However, white glutinous rice sales were weaker and fell by two cents, and Dujian rice, due to oversupply, depreciated by a small amount. Foreign glutinous rice remained unchanged. The sale of thick and thin broken rice slowed down at times, so prices fell again by 10 to 20 cents. Old and deteriorated original goods were rare and showed no profit or loss. New Yin Yuan rice was mediocre.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 37-38 firms from the river arrived with various goods. Sales in the market were flat in the morning but improved in the afternoon. The market for broken and high-quality rice was stable, with medium and low-quality rice being slightly tight. High-quality new glutinous rice stood firm, while prices for medium and low-quality new glutinous rice increased by about 10 cents. The prices of new Yangdu and Bujian rice were slightly tight. Thin, early-season, deteriorated and original, and Ke glutinous rice showed no profit or loss. Sales were weak in the morning but tight in the evening.</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea Overseas Silk Market Sees Another Turnaround</h3>
<p>Yesterday there was no market in New York. Yokohama spot and forward goods rose by about 30-50 yuan. The Shanghai silk market seemed to be thinking of moving after a long period of quiet. Also, overseas silk prices have remained relatively stable. Therefore, yesterday, many telegrams were sent externally by local Western firms to reverse the situation. Whether this will happen will depend on tomorrow's New York market conditions. It is understood that the foreign purchase price for White Factory Brand characters seven and eight, with an even fineness of 0.22 strands, only fetched a price of 640-650 yuan. 13.15 strands fetched 680-690 yuan. However, the local market's usual price for the former is around 670 yuan, and the latter is around 720 yuan. Therefore, transactions were difficult. Yesterday, only Da Chang and other foreign firms made small purchases. Among users, the Hangzhou merchants made some transactions. Market sentiment and people's confidence were still stable, but transactions were quite slow.</p>
<h3>New Arrival of Thin Iron Sheets</h3>
<p>Thin iron sheets, which had been out of stock for many days, arrived at various warehouses such as Kung Ho Cheung, New Taikoo, etc., over the past two days (estimated to be three hundred twenty to thirty boxes). This has alleviated concerns about stock shortages in the market. The market price is 65 yuan per box. It is reported that fellow traders have already sold forty to fifty boxes, mainly purchased by cigarette companies and biscuit factories.</p>

<h3>Green Tea Transactions Still Scarce</h3>
<p>Yesterday, green tea transactions by foreign firms remained scarce. British and French firms hesitated due to telegrams from Morocco indicating prices were too low and didn't align with current market prices. A wait-and-see attitude prevailed, and the market remained sluggish. Only a few firms like Xiehe purchased approximately 300 chests of Lu Zhuang "Zhen Mei" and "Zhen Zhen Mei" green tea, with prices falling by one or two yuan compared to previous sales.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Why are Xiamen Tangerine Cakes Arriving Late? — Shantou Tangerine Cakes are Large and Beautiful —</h3>
<p>Xiamen tangerine cakes have been in short supply due to inventory shortages in the producing areas, resulting in prolonged unavailability. It had been out of stock for a long time. It has been found that a small amount has arrived on the "Taiyuan" ship yesterday, and samples can be seen today. If the goods are bright red, they should sell well, but unfortunately, the goods have arrived too late. Otherwise, if they had arrived before the holidays, the prices could have been increased.</p>
<p>Tangerine cakes from Meishuitou are large, beautiful, and of excellent quality. Supplies are also scarce. Only five pieces arrived at the market a few days ago, which were sold yesterday, rising by one or two yuan compared to before.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Guangdong Coarse White Sugar Transactions Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable. The association's set price for coarse granulated white sugar was 21.8 yuan, and imported goods were 6.4 yuan. Only Dong Bai No. 8 spot goods rose by five cents, to 21.45 yuan, with no other changes. Mian Bai Zhen No. 1 from this factory was 20.5 yuan; the rest remained unchanged. The market saw the Chaozhou gang selling over a hundred bags of second-grade red sugar at 13.45 to 13.65 yuan, Yi Ji red sugar at 14.95 yuan, trading over forty bags, Zhiyang forty bags at 17.8 yuan, Nanjin green sugar several dozens of bags at 14.3 yuan, and ordinary Longxing over a hundred bags at 12.9 yuan.</p>
<p>The joint venture company held its first tender for Guangdong sugar this week, with a total quota of over ten thousand bags. Tender prices remained as before. The company sold 750 bags of Dechang's "Five Rams" coarse white sugar at 21.5 yuan, 70 bags from Jieyang Factory at 21.3 yuan, another 100 bags at 20.9 yuan, and 74 bags of granulated white sugar from the market at 19.4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Thick Tinplate Sales Robust</h3>
<p>Thick tinplate sales have been exceptionally strong recently. It has been found that four to five hundred boxes were sold in the past few days. The best quality is priced at 100 yuan per box, the second best at 80 yuan, and the best "wild chicken" goods (i.e., those with uneven sizes) sell for 80 yuan, the second best for 60 yuan. In addition to the military's needs, yarn factories have also been stocking up on this product recently.</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Ye Xin Fo)</p>
<p>If you frequently interact with middle school students, you will find that masturbation is a very serious problem. They are in a period of vigorous development, and many have sallow complexions, poor spirits, dizziness, and tinnitus. They adopt a passing-grade mentality toward their studies, especially in mathematics, where their performance is generally average. Because of the loss of brainpower and weakened nerves, mathematics problems are complex and mentally taxing, making them difficult to cope with. This is why there have been virtually no inventions in physics, chemistry, or mechanics over the years, and even imitation is impossible.</p>
<p>The physiques of those who masturbate become very lazy because all parts of their bodies are exhausted. They often avoid physical labor and are not interested in sports. That's why China didn't get a single award at this World Games. It is obvious that their physical strength is insufficient and too few people like sports. The results of the World Games are truly the fairest litmus test of the strength of each country.</p>
<p>Young people inevitably experience sexual urges when they reach physiological maturity. If they use appropriate entertainment to regulate themselves during this critical period, they can avoid masturbation. This entertainment is exercise. Because sexual desire decreases naturally after exercise-induced fatigue, the act of masturbation can be avoided. If schools use every means to encourage and promote sports at this time, and also instill sexual health education, then it will not be difficult to win back a few championships in the next World Games, and there will be a considerable amount of imitation and invention in the industrial field as well. Masturbation is a serious problem, and should not be ignored!</p>
<h3>The Fate of Hair</h3>
<p>— Han Ashe</p>
<p>Hair truly has a tumultuous fate. In medieval times, it was targeted and used in the "kun" punishment, which involved shaving the head completely bald.</p>
<p>After the abolition of the "kun" punishment, it managed to survive for several years. Monks and nuns don't count, but in the early Qing Dynasty, it suffered another misfortune when all hair was changed into queues and shaved off.</p>
<p>By the mid-Qing Dynasty, the Taiping Rebellion had lost a large part of the country. Their people never shaved their heads, so they were called "Longhairs." People at that time were in a very difficult position: shaving their heads meant death if they met the "Longhairs," and not shaving their heads meant death if they met the Qing soldiers. This was a time when "double hair" might have emerged.</p>
<p>After the Taiping Rebellion was quelled, the whole country uniformly dragged a pigtail behind their heads, and it seemed that hair would no longer be a problem. However, by the late Qing Dynasty, Western customs had spread to China, and people with vision knew that dragging this queue was shameful, but the national law did not allow you to cut it off. Even so, the motive for disaster had been planted. When the Wuchang Uprising started, the first thing they did wherever the righteous flag went was to cut off queues. It has been twenty-five years since then, and queues should have been completely cut off. But in reality, this is not the case. Even someone who had been a minor official in the Qing Dynasty for even a day would hide and keep a small queue on the top of his head, as a former loyalist. And there are also old folks in poor and remote areas who keep a pigtail, thinking that if the rites are lost, they should be sought in the countryside, and that the ancient ways are still in the world.</p>
<p>The styles of hair now, apart from women, are many: parted hair, flat hair, monk's head... It is always thought that hair can continue like this, and no longer cause problems. But who knows that with the evolution of human affairs, it still needs to be discussed, such as students and soldiers who have to shave their heads. The most ridiculous thing was that last summer, in more than a dozen counties up and down the Huai River in northern Jiangsu, the new Fifth Division checked the Baobians, and rumors spread that those with hair were suspected. So one told ten, and ten told a hundred. In a few days, the streets everywhere were shining brightly, all in the same mold. But in reality, there was no such thing at all. It's just adding some business to the barbershops.</p>
<p>The future fate of hair cannot be predicted, but it will probably not be very dull. It will change with the times.</p>
<h3>Red Bean Rice Dumplings</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>It seems like it was more than twenty years ago, in the ×× River area, that 'Red Bean Rice Dumplings' were already quite famous. Red bean rice dumplings are made by mixing red beans with glutinous rice and wrapping them in rice dumpling leaves. However, the red bean rice dumplings in ×× River were valued for their maker, and the maker was known for her dumplings, which had quite a history.</p>
<p>Speaking of the origin of these red bean rice dumplings, it might have been as far back as thirty years ago. On the south bank of the ×× River lived a pitiful widow with three children, barely making ends meet. Because she had nothing to cook, she sold some red beans and glutinous rice, selling red bean rice dumplings. At that time, the widow was only twenty-seven or eight years old. Although not beautiful, she was quite attractive. At that time, the atmosphere in Shanghai was not as debauched as it is now, so when such a young woman selling rice dumplings was discovered in the market, everyone flocked to patronize her. Coincidentally, the widow had three red moles on her face, so everyone gave her a nickname, calling her "Red Bean Rice Dumpling."</p>
<p>Since her nickname became "Red Bean Rice Dumpling," her red bean rice dumplings became famous day by day, and business became better and better. After five or six years, she renovated the house and simply opened a snack shop. But the most popular item with customers was naturally red bean rice dumplings, because she had accumulated five or six years of experience and made red bean rice dumplings with a unique flavor. Although there were also frivolous customers who patronized her because the proprietress was known as "Red Bean Rice Dumpling," most customers were there because her rice dumplings had a unique flavor.</p>
<p>In more than twenty years, she not only relied on selling red bean rice dumplings to provide for her family, but also earned considerable farmland and houses. A few years ago, her eldest son, younger son, and son-in-law all gained some social status, so they forced her to give up the snack shop to enjoy her old age. Although she was reluctant, she finally gave in to the requests of her children and sold the shop, living a peaceful life as an old woman. But those who knew her history still secretly called her "Red Bean Rice Dumpling" behind her back when they saw her.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I happened to be passing by her new house and saw that her family was holding a funeral. Looking closely, under the epitaph "Lasting Example" written by a certain celebrity, three moles were clearly arranged on the deceased's face. This was tantamount to telling me that the red bean rice dumpling old woman, who had built her wealth from scratch, had passed away. But the impression of red bean rice dumplings will never be erased from my mind.</p>
<h3>Swapping Phoenixes</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Deep Brotherly Love Hides Letter, Pities Weak Sister; Heavy Poetic Air Reveals Shadows, Laughs at Poor Scholar</p>
<p>Menglan smiled and said, "Why am I unreasonable?" Youmei said, "You know what you mean by what you said. Do I need to explain it in detail? What do you mean by this? Could it be..." At this point, she blushed and suddenly stopped talking. It seemed as if she was about to smile, but before the smile could show, she pursed her lips and puffed out her cheeks. Menglan laughed and said, "Are you still taking my joke to heart?" Youmei laughed and said, "Who takes your words to heart? I'm just kidding with you. Besides, you're feeling sad right now. I wouldn't bear to find fault with you." When Menglan heard this, she just smiled and didn't say anything else. Since they had said this much, Youmei couldn't continue with the reason for her visit. After chatting about other things, she took her leave. However, in this way, Menglan felt a great emotion in her heart, thinking that her fate was far worse than Youmei's. She had such a civilized family, such a free environment, and such a healthy body. What could she compare to her? Because of this, she felt extremely uncomfortable, as if she was getting sick again. She stayed upstairs all day and didn't even show her face to her family. According to her own mood, she didn't want to go to school. But then she thought that Guochi must have sent a letter in the past few days. If the letter wasn't sent to her home, it would definitely be sent to the school. In three to five days, the letter would be safe in the mailroom. But if it was too long, she was afraid that the letter would fall into someone else's hands. Therefore, she reluctantly struggled and went to school again. Speaking of which, it was an extremely contradictory thing. According to Menglan's own expression, she didn't want to correspond with Zhang Guochi. But if she didn't receive Guochi's letter, she felt like something was missing in her heart. She couldn't explain this to herself. What was the reason? During this time of expectation, Guochi was able to live up to her expectations. He sent a letter to Menglan every week. In this situation, there was another strange thing, that was, even though he sent letters, when the two met on the road, they just glanced at each other from afar. When they got close, they still lowered their heads and walked past. On Guochi's side, Menglan didn't know what he meant. On Menglan's own side, she felt that a girl couldn't talk to a stranger without reason. Although there was only a difference of twenty years between 1920 and now, in recent China, it felt like two centuries had passed. The young people around the age of twenty today don't believe how closed off the social interactions between men and women were at that time. (81)</p>
<p>Short News 1: Jiang Jun Zhongchuan, a famous scholar in Wuzhong, when he was the director of the camp support office, collected more than ten pieces of Guangwu Mausoleum bricks in the homes of civilians near the Guangwu Mausoleum in Luoyang, Henan. Both sides have horses or phoenixes, or Jiahe, or warriors, or civil officials, or Doufang, patterns, each different, fragrant and antique, extremely valuable. They are now brought back and displayed in the Grand Auditorium of the Xiugu Cemetery in Mudu, which was created by Jiang Jun, for public viewing.</p>
<p>Small Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Mission and Death Sentence</h3>
<p>— (Lu Guowei)</p>
<p>It is said that Mussolini of Italy has the mission of restoring the glory of the ancient Roman Empire. Hitler of Germany has the mission of obtaining the territory of Greater Germany before the European War. ×× people have the mission of becoming the masters of East Asia... You also have a mission, I also have a mission, everyone has a mission. In order to achieve their own mission, they spare no expense in increasing military spending, expanding military equipment, and extending military service. As a result, the number of unemployed and starving people at home is increasing day by day, and the crisis of a second major massacre abroad is approaching day by day. Alas! This kind of "mission" is simply preparing a "death sentence" for all mankind. What else can be said!</p>
<h3>Beginning of Eyebrow Painting</h3>
<p>— Zhao Tiefan</p>
<p>The matter of eyebrow painting, as seen in our old history, should be from the Biography of Zhang Chang in the Han Shu; "...Also painted eyebrows for his wife, and in Chang'an, Zhang Jingzhao was known as 'Eyebrow Fude'...", the record is the earliest. Liu Xi's Shi Ming; "Dai represents, it means to remove the eyebrows and replace them." The explanation is more detailed. Shi Wen Lei Ju; "The Han palace women swept green Dai to paint moth eyebrows." This shows that the custom of eyebrow painting originated in the Western Han Dynasty. Liu Xi trained Dai as a substitute, which is also based on the same sound and meaning, as in Shuowen Jiezi, training Tian as Dian, training Kao as the meaning of old age. Cui Bao's Gujin Zhu; "The Wei palace women liked to draw long eyebrows." Tang Li Yishan's Untitled Poem; "Long eyebrows can already be painted," Zhu Qingyu's poem on Yishi Zhang Shuibu; "How deep or shallow is the eyebrow painting in fashion?" It can be seen that the custom of eyebrow painting was transmitted to the Wei and Tang dynasties and had not yet declined. Zhu's phrase "deep or shallow eyebrow painting" refers to the depth of the Dai color. Song Zhu Yi's Yijue Liao Miscellaneous Records: "Today's women shave off their eyebrows and paint them with ink, which is an ancient method." Zhu thought that the Song people used ink to explain that the Han people used Dai. Kao Chu Ci; "Powder white Dai black," it can be seen that Dai is also black, and the Han and Song dynasties used it for eyebrow painting, which is no different. Since the Song Dynasty, although there are no frequent records about eyebrow painting, poets often use eyebrow painting, which is extremely ordinary. The custom of eyebrow painting is very popular in modern times, and it can also be inferred that the custom of eyebrow painting has never been cut off since the Song Dynasty.</p>
<h3>Sago Palm</h3>
<p>— Chen Tianci</p>
<p>Guangdong has a kind of sago palm (this tree grows in tropical areas), which is five or six zhang high, and its leaves are composed of many leaflets. The center of the trunk has pollen, which is reddish-yellow and can be used to make cakes.</p>
<p>However, Cantonese customs are often superstitious, because the branches and trunks of the sago palm go straight up without branches, which is said to symbolize a man's devotion. Therefore, whenever a woman has a husband and has an affair, she must pray in front of the sago palm (it is said that there is a god in this tree), and secretly tie the man's belt to the trunk, so that the man can be devoted to the woman and grow old together.</p>
<p>Therefore, every sago palm in Guangdong can often see many incense sticks, incantations, paper figures, and other sacrificial offerings, plastered all over the foot of the tree.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Talks on Autumn Insects</h3>
<p>— Cheng Xuan</p>
<p>The season of "Autumn Sounded by Insects" has come again! Indeed, whether in the morning or evening, in the city or the countryside, you can hear autumn insects singing tunes composed by nature everywhere. However, when sad people hear it, they not only don't enjoy the beauty of this song, but instead arouse their sorrows, like Ouyang Xiu's Autumn Sound Fu, "But I only hear the sound of insects chirping on all four walls, as if to assist my sighs!"</p>
<p>Among the autumn insects, the cricket is the most popular. Although it is autumn and dark, some people also support the cricket. Therefore, when it comes to autumn insects, scholars in the past have used crickets to arouse their literary interest and poetic inspiration, I don't know how much. Indeed, crickets are quite interesting. Its chirping sound, unlike other autumn insects, can be used as a thermometer. It is like the swallow among birds, a migratory bird that knows the time, predicting climate change. This is because its every move is related to climate temperature changes. In May, it can only jump, in June it can fly and chirp. By August, due to the invasion and attack of the cold, it moves from the wilderness to the foot of the wall for self-defense. By October, it comes to the bed to seek survival. I remember that a famous meteorologist Broc said that the most active period of crickets is from summer to mid-autumn. When the Fahrenheit thermometer is fifteen degrees, it is the lowest limit of cricket chirping. Broc went on to say that at Fahrenheit 79, it chirps 183 times per minute. When the temperature drops, the chirping also decreases, until it stops outside the temperature limit. Therefore, its chirping can be used as a thermometer, and it is very accurate! And if its chirping is clearer than usual, you can know that there are signs of a storm! When it comes to Chinese crickets, I feel that the greatness of its chirping is really not comparable to ordinary autumn insects!</p>
<h3>Let Him Sleep a Little Longer!</h3>
<p>— Zhang Huang</p>
<p>The sound is so loud early in the morning!</p>
<p>It's not crying and shouting, it's just the old woman doing housework, bumping into things left and right.</p>
<p>Gently lift the curtain to see if you have been awakened?</p>
<p>Coming into the room, one after another.</p>
<p>Looking back and cursing in a low voice:</p>
<p>"I don't know what I owe you in that life?"</p>
<p>Thinking that he has suffered for years and his spirit is bad, how can he bear to always sleep less and wake up quickly?</p>
<p>Thank you for letting him sleep a little longer!</p>
<p>Hoping that he is healthy, I am willing to pray for him all day and night.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "Gold is priced, but the body is priceless!"</p>

<p>Shen Bao Medical Special</p>
<h3>Medical Examination</h3>
<p>— Yao Xing Shu</p>
<p>Medical examinations are gradually attracting social attention. Patients need examinations, and healthy people also need examinations, called health examinations; in addition to one person being examined, there are also group examinations. No matter what, the effectiveness of medical examinations seems to be being elevated by someone every day. Although this is irrelevant to the value of the examination itself.</p>
<p>Usually, I observe that the general public has two views on examinations: one is that they overbelieve in examinations, bordering on superstition, and the other is that they do not believe in examinations, which is somewhat stubborn. These two opposite attitudes commit the fault of going too far.</p>
<p>Everyone should know that when new doctors diagnose illnesses, they use the methods of visual examination, tactile examination, percussion, and auscultation. This is using the innate abilities of the five senses to do some exploratory work on the patient's body, using it to help diagnose, in order to facilitate treatment. The method is simple, very practical, and can be said to be the beginning of medical examinations. However, the power of the five senses is limited, and sometimes it is not enough to meet our needs, which is also a fact.</p>
<p>Medicine is progressing every day, and other sciences are also becoming more prosperous day by day. Therefore, the methods of medical examinations are becoming more complex. They can be divided into three types: 1. Biological examinations, including various bacteria, microbial examinations, blood reactions, etc.; 2. Physical examinations, including blood pressure measurement, X-ray fluoroscopy, etc.; 3. Chemical examinations, including examination of sugars, proteins, gastric juice, etc. Although these have excellent equipment and meticulous methods, they have undeniable value; but the four methods of visual, tactile, percussion, and auscultation, which are regarded as the beginning of medical examinations, still maintain their arrogant posture. All pure doctors know that a pair of black eyes, two fleshy ears, and a pair of jade hands can gain something from the symptoms. In addition, our past experience can also greatly supplement the shortcomings of mechanized test tubes, microscopes, X-rays, etc.</p>
<p>We must understand that all examinations are only in a supporting position in medical treatment, and are only helpful for diagnosis and treatment. Those who are superstitious about it regard the auxiliary as the only one, which makes the examination feel flattered; those who do not believe in it regard the value of the auxiliary as worthless, which is too unfair to it. Originally, the results of the examination can only represent a part of the facts, and cannot reach the entirety of the facts. It should not be regarded as the entire report of each patient.</p>
<p>For example, people with pulmonary tuberculosis can detect tuberculosis bacteria in their sputum; people with purulent leucorrhea can detect gonorrhea in their secretions. If it is detected, it is ironclad evidence that the patient is indeed suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis or purulent leucorrhea. Isn't the examination enough for people to believe? But not being able to detect it is also common. We can only say that no tuberculosis bacteria were found in the sputum, and no gonorrhea were found in the secretions. We cannot say that this person does not have this disease. Therefore, the examination is not enough for people to believe. For example, whether or not there is syphilis, most people already know to solve it by testing blood, but in special circumstances, the blood reaction of syphilis patients cannot be detected; this does not mean that they do not have syphilis. When malaria attacks, malaria parasites can indeed be detected in the blood, but there are also many patients who cannot detect them, and we still have to regard them as malaria. In short, all examinations, such as not detecting anything, is not an absolute indication that there is no such disease.</p>
<p>To bring the conversation back, if something is detected in the examination, it seems reliable, but experienced doctors do not think that way. They still have to compare it with all the symptoms and study it carefully before making a diagnosis. This is the doctor's business, and there is no need to say more about it here.</p>
<p>In short, the results of medical examinations are affected by various environments. For example, a person with closed pulmonary tuberculosis (that is, the part of the lung disease does not communicate with the trachea) is not easy to find tuberculosis bacteria in the sputum; syphilis patients who have received incomplete syphilis treatment may not show a blood syphilis reaction. In addition, how is the technology and temperament of the person in charge of the examination work, which is related to the results of the examination. Therefore, not being able to detect anything, in addition to the factual difficulties, sometimes bears the responsibility of negligence; detecting something, sometimes bears the correct responsibility. Although these two responsibilities are not a problem legally; this makes the location occupied by the test even more visible.</p>
<h3>Some Views on Promoting New Rural Medicine and Hygiene (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Han Zhongying</p>
<p>(3) Utilizing the Baojia System—As mentioned above; relying solely on connecting with old doctors to promote new medicine and hygiene, while dealing with farmers who are like scattered sand, never having been subjected to the control of others, nor having experienced the suppression of others, thus developing a habit of lacking unity and organization, and lacking a consistent mind, and wanting to run to a rural area where one is unfamiliar and the organization is like scattered sand, to handle a perfect matter, is truly not an easy task! In the first half of the year, the government, in light of this, felt that the spirit of the farmers was too scattered and too unorganized, and held Baojia training. At the same time, those who were promoted to be Baojia chiefs were also outstanding figures among the farmers. Moreover, they had received a long period of proper training. It is much better to deal with them than with ordinary ignorant farmers because they are the leaders of the farmers, and they must be consulted on matters large and small. Therefore, for the promotion of new medicine and hygiene, it is necessary to first find a way to cooperate with them, which is no different from having ordinary farmers obey us, and saves a lot of trouble, while achieving satisfactory results in a simple way.</p>
<p>(4) To Make the Government and the People Cooperate—To popularize new rural medicine and hygiene, it is not enough to rely on a small amount of power. Therefore, the government and the people must cooperate. On the one hand, we should use the government's financial resources and influence to promote this work. On the other hand, we must rely on the masses to organize themselves automatically so that they can accept this work, striving for consistency between top and bottom, full cooperation, and jointly seeking the progress of this cause. Only then can this organizational work be effective and lasting; and new medicine and hygiene will have the hope of being promoted automatically.</p>
<p>(5) To Establish Free Clinics—To establish free clinics in the central locations of the countryside, because the provision of a little medical relief will arouse the "good feelings of the general farmers in the area where medical relief is provided for rural medical and health institutions." Regardless of the extent of the effect of this point on the effectiveness of rural medical and health treatment facilities; at the same time, when they come to the clinic, you can use some pictures, slogans, or impart some common knowledge of nursing for common diseases, pre-disease prevention, post-disease treatment, and daily life hygiene to them, so that they can understand the technology and value of new medicine, and know the relationship between the benefits and harms of hygiene and unhygienic conditions. This not only builds a solid foundation for new medicine, but also greatly helps to popularize rural medicine and hygiene.</p>
<p>(6) Training Personnel—Even with a sound organization and complete facilities, the lack of adequate staff is still an imperfection. In other words, it is a basic difficulty in promoting rural medicine and hygiene. Therefore, once the goals are determined, staff must be trained. According to the stipulated organization, you can know what kind of talents are needed, and then train such talents according to this need, so that supply and demand can be effectively matched, and the application of talents can also be appropriate. However, in terms of technical training, in addition to being fully based on scientific medical methods and knowledge, special attention must be paid to the cultivation of personality. This is the most easily overlooked thing in ordinary training of personnel. Regarding personality training, attention should be paid to the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Cultivate the spirit of "serving as the purpose." (2) Train in a simple life; it is necessary to ensure that the staff's life is almost the same as the life of the local people, so that the farmers do not feel a "disparity"; if the standard of living can be reduced, the salary will naturally not be high, and about thirty to forty yuan per month will be enough to satisfy. (3) Treat people with "sincerity" and be "faithful" in doing things! (4) Absolutely correct bad habits such as perfunctoriness, emphasis on appearances, laziness, lack of progress, perfunctory performance, and deception.</p>
<p>Finally, I have one more opinion to contribute to the current staff engaged in rural medicine and hygiene. It is very important that this kind of work can be promoted together by the entire society. At the same time, regarding the cause of rural revitalization, start by promoting rural medicine and hygiene and lay the foundation for rural revitalization; however, the degree of promotion in the future depends on whether we have a whole goal, a sound organization, and work hard and cautiously to complete this rural mission, which will not only provide security for farmers, but also greatly help the work of rural revitalization.</p>
<p>(1) Improving Education—Farmers live in remote villages, far from the city, and the education system is still the old method. They still read ancient books. As for what secondary education and higher education are, they do not even have the opportunity to enjoy primary education. People are not knowledgeable, and medicine and hygiene are naturally difficult to promote. Therefore, it is hoped that the pioneers in running rural medicine and hygiene and the leaders in the education field will do their best to promote new education and jointly seek the popularization and improvement of new rural education. The hygiene course can be listed as a basic course because hygiene education is the fundamental education related to national survival. Simple words can be used to teach them the causes of diseases, the prevention of diseases, the benefits of new medicine and hygiene, first aid treatments, and some unreliable knowledge such as praying to gods and asking divination, so that they can plant simple medical knowledge and hygiene concepts when they are young; for older people, teach them some new scientific knowledge and new living habits to open up their minds. In this way, a new rural area can be created in a few years, and at the same time, it will greatly assist in the promotion of new medicine and hygiene.</p>
<p>(2) Connecting with Old Doctors—Farmers cannot get the cultivation of new education, let alone the enjoyment of new medicine. In addition to seeking gods and asking divination, people who are relatively knowledgeable or wealthy all adopt old doctors and deeply believe in old doctors. There is no influence or concept of new doctors at all. Therefore, the general corrupt old doctors often persuade people to take out a medical package. The medicines they use are mostly some ascending and descending medicines, or some symptomatic medicines, just perfunctorily doing things. Therefore, the general ignorant farmers are poisoned by it, thinking that only doctors who offer a package of treatments can do their best to diagnose and treat, and use more good medicines. This is a common wrong concept of farmers; so-called doctors have a compassionate heart, how can they not diagnose and treat with all their heart. Moreover, new doctors do not offer a package of treatments, and at the same time, packages of treatments are prohibited by law. In addition, the nature of farmers is mostly stubborn, which is a major obstacle to the promotion of new doctors. Therefore, for new medicine and hygiene to be promoted without obstacles, it is necessary to connect with old doctors, stand on the same battle line, cooperate in research, and jointly seek the popularization and promotion of new medicine and hygiene.

<h3>Describing Li Kejia and Li Kejia's Illness (II)</h3>
<p>— Chen Duanbai</p>
<p>Local Exanthematous Typhus Rndemischer Elethty dhus</p>
<p>Tsutsugamushi Disease Uberschezsfieber Saelz Tautsuzanussyi-Kraukheeit, T.fever Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica has the following records under the article on sand fleas:</p>
<p>Compendium of Materia Medica of Sand (Explanation of Names) Xuan Sound Geng Xuan Guangya Peng Huo Wanbi Technique</p>
<p>Land brand</p>
<p>Collection and Explanation Shizhen said, according to Guo Yigong's Guangzhi, sand fleas are in the water, red in color, no larger than a machine, entering people's skin, killing people. Wan Hong's Baopuzi said that fleas are found in both water and land, and after rain, in the morning and evening, stepping on sand will definitely attach to people like hairs pricking people, entering the skin, and can be picked out with a needle. It is as red as cinnabar. If not picked out, it will enter the flesh and can kill people. Whenever you encounter this flea, you should walk back and forth with fire to bake your body, and it will come out, following the fire. Also, Zhouhou Fang said that there are many sand fleas in the mountains and waters, which are very small and barely visible. When people enter the water or walk in the grass in the shade, these insects often attach to people and drill into the skin, causing people's skin to feel like being pierced by awn needles, red like millet beans. After three days of piercing, cold and heat cause sores, and the insects gradually enter the bones, killing people. People in Lingnan initially had this, and scraped it off with thatch leaves or bamboo leaves, and then applied bitter lettuce juice. If it is deep, pick it out with a needle, and the insects are just like scabies insects. I think that the poison of creek poison, the poison of shooting workers, and the poison of sand fleas are all similar, and all seem like typhoid fever, so there are methods of picking sand and scraping sand. Now, people who are sick with wind and cold scrape their whole body with hemp and peach and willow branches, which is also called scraping sand, which originated from scraping sand disease. Sand disease is also called water sand, water typhoid fever. In the beginning, it is like typhoid fever, headache, strong cooked nausea, slight coldness in the end of hands and feet, or abdominal pain and confusion, killing people in a moment, which is called twisting intestine sand.</p>
<p>Appendix, Shizhen said, according to Luyi Ji, there are sand insects in Tan Yuan Chu Ji and other states, which are poisonous snakes. The insects in the scales and shells are tormented. Every time they enter the rapids and are crushed out, people are poisoned by them and die in three days. This is also the amount of sand fleas.</p>
<p>Carefully reading the records proves that the vector of tsutsugamushi disease is the red mite Aka.muslin (scientific name Trombioua Akamushi). Its symptoms are similar to typhoid fever, so I dare to add a question mark to the term water typhoid fever and list it as a synonym for tsutsugamushi disease. Kawamura Rin'ya, a Japanese researcher of tsutsugamushi disease, also mentioned in his book "Research on Tsutsugamushi Disease" that this disease was also prevalent in the Xiangjiang and Ganjiang River basins in ancient China. He did not mention where his research came from, but I am afraid that it is not unrelated to the Compendium of Materia Medica mentioned above. Furthermore, based on our current situation, we cannot conclude that this disease has become extinct just because there are no reports from relevant parties (such as church hospital doctors). Li Kejia's research methods and paths are still in their infancy. The fact that typhoid-like diseases are confused with paratyphoid fever or similar symptoms is even a must-have fact in the current medical field. Regarding this disease, there is still room for discussion and necessity as to whether it actually exists within our country.</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge Q&amp;A on Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(92) Gout (Bottom)</p>
<p>What is the prognosis of gout, good or bad?</p>
<p>If reasonable treatment can be carried out, it can be completely cured. If it is combined with kidney or heart disease, uremia or even stroke may occur, which is dangerous. Is it easy to diagnose gout?</p>
<p>Gout is easy to diagnose when it occurs, but it should be distinguished from acute rheumatic stiffness. Usually, it should be distinguished from chronic multiple arthritis or degenerative arthritis. How should gout be treated?</p>
<p>The treatment of gout should be carried out from three aspects: food therapy, drug therapy, and physical therapy.</p>
<p>What is food therapy?</p>
<p>The first priority of food is to prohibit eating meat and drinking alcohol. You can eat more plant-based foods such as fruits and vegetables. Milk, coffee, eggs, tea, mineral spring juice can all be used as much as possible. What is drug therapy?</p>
<p>Taking Atophan internally is the most effective, or using Atophan Neil injection. In addition, internal administration of salicylic acid can also be used. Analgesics should only be used temporarily. What is physical therapy?</p>
<p>In order to promote metabolism, exercise and warm baths should be carried out regularly. During acute attacks, wrap the joints and rest quietly in bed until the inflammation subsides before operating again.</p>
<h3>Investigation Report on the Health Status of Haining Xiashi, Zhejiang (III)</h3>
<p>— Shen Songnian</p>
<p>Among the public entertainment venues, the most elegant is the People's Education Hall, followed by the public sports field at the foot of Jue Shen Mountain, and then the Xiashi Theater, which is currently performing Peking Opera. The Xixi Park of the Tie Lu Labor at the foot of Zihui Mountain has long been corrupt and unbearable due to poor management; it is not as good as the Shen Garden outside Henggang Bridge, with its exquisite pavilions, flowers, and lush trees and bamboos, and its serene scenery. Famous products such as honey peaches and white orchids have long been well-known. The garden is quite tidy everywhere, and is most suitable as a public recreation place, but it is a private garden and rarely open, so the average public cannot feast their eyes.</p>
<p>(7) Charitable Organizations</p>
<p>The charitable organizations in Xiashi Town with slightly larger scale buildings are the Nursery, the Poor Children's Home, the Poor People's Skills Training Center, and the Homeless Shelter. There are more than ten names set up by other industries and philanthropists, but they often cannot be fully developed due to financial constraints.</p>
<p>(8) Produced Drugs</p>
<p>There are no special drugs here, and the produced drugs cannot be used for formal medical purposes because the farmland is mainly used for broad beans, rice and wheat, and there are no formal planting drugs. However, there are many names of drugs produced in uncultivated land, such as mountains, etc. The main ones are described as follows: Jingjie, Banbangzi, Taoren, Pyrethrum, Wild Chrysanthemum, Haijinsha, Digupi, Mint, Patchouli, Loquat Leaves, Apricot Kernels, Xiangyuan, etc.</p>
<p>(9) Small-Scale Factories</p>
<p>There are no large-scale factories in Xiashi Town. The electric light company can hold the bull's ear of Xiashi factories, followed by Kangtai, Tailong, Taifeng, Wanyouyu, etc., more than ten rice mills. Most of the workers are from Jiangbei because Jiangbei people can endure hardship and are loyal to their duties, and their wages are relatively low, so each factory is happy to hire them. As for health facilities, there are many areas for improvement.</p>
<p>(10) Endemic Diseases</p>
<p>There are no special endemic diseases in Xiashi, but beriberi (commonly known as Hong Kong foot) is very common. Since the domestically produced "Minsheng" cure-all ointment came out, the public can all treat themselves, so the sales of this "cure-all" are very good.</p>
<p>(11) Epidemics</p>
<p>In addition to the fact that the legally defined acute infectious disease plague has never been epidemic here, cholera, cerebrospinal meningitis, etc. have all been epidemic, but not very severely. This has to be attributed to the strict prevention and control of the authorities and medical institutions.</p>
<p>(12) Public Medical Institutions</p>
<p>(A) Anti-Smoking Center</p>
<p>The district-run anti-smoking center was ordered to open last October. The director is Chen Yuren, director of the Xiashi Public Security Bureau, and the deputy is Wu Guanlan, who is also the district chief. There are two doctors, one county-appointed doctor, one assistant doctor, two officers, and two workers. The smoking cessation method adopted is the foaming method and the morphine addiction reduction method, which has achieved remarkable results and has been praised by the superiors. Special Commissioner Wu Wangji praised it and said: It is the most effective among the nearby counties. No less than 300 people have quit and left the center. The required expenses are 300 yuan per month, and the source of funding is mostly raised by local gentry.</p>
<h3>Hygiene Knowledge of Ear, Nose, Throat and Eye Diseases</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(102) What is night blindness and day blindness?</p>
<p>Our eyes have a function of distinguishing between light and dark. This function is called light perception in medicine. The rods in the retinal visual cells are dedicated to light perception. As for the cones, they are responsible for vision and color perception. The central part of the retina has more cones, and the edge part has fewer rods. Therefore, our ability to sense weak light is strongest in the edge part. There is also the so-called dark adaptation, which is when we enter a dark room from outdoors, we often cannot see everything in the room. After a moment, and after adapting to the darkness, we can clearly recognize everything in the room. Conversely, after staying in a dark room for a long time, when we suddenly go outdoors, we feel dizzy. But soon we can adapt to it and return to the original normal state. This situation is called light adaptation.</p>
<p>If light perception is weakened, or dark adaptation is impaired, it is specifically called night blindness in medicine. In short, the vision during the day is no different from ordinary people, but at dusk, or in places with insufficient light, the vision can be extremely reduced. Therefore, there are special names in the common people, such as sparrow eyes and chicken blindness (this is because the eyes of sparrows and chickens are also dim in the evening and bright in the morning.)</p>
<p>There are two types of night blindness, congenital and acquired. Acquired night blindness is further divided into two types: idiopathic night blindness and night blindness caused by organic changes in the retina.</p>
<p>(1) Congenital night blindness—For example, it often occurs in Oguchi's disease and white spot retinitis. Oguchi's disease was discovered by Japanese Oguchi Chuta. It is a congenital retinal abnormality. Children often complain of night blindness. White spot retinitis is a congenital degeneration of the outer layer of the retina. Scattered small white spots occur on the retinal surface. Among the subjective symptoms, night blindness is often complained of.</p>
<p>(2) Idiopathic night blindness—This disease is generally caused by malnutrition and lack of vitamin A. It is often accompanied by conjunctival xerosis. It is more common in poor children. It is easy to occur in summer and autumn. The body is often weak. The so-called sparrow eye and dry eye in the common people refers to this disease. The patient's vision is normal during the day, but he cannot see objects at dusk. This disease should be treated with more nourishment and internal administration of cod liver oil, which should have a miraculous effect. In ancient Chinese prescriptions for sparrow eye and dry eye, chicken liver, pig liver, beef liver, and sheep liver are often used. It is said that they are indeed effective. Therefore, the liver has indeed had a clear therapeutic value for this disease for a long time.</p>
<p>(3) Night blindness caused by retinal degeneration or atrophy—For example, it often occurs in retinal pigmentary degeneration and congenital syphilitic retinochoroidal atrophy. Retinal pigmentary degeneration is a hereditary disease. The descendants of consanguineous marriages are prone to suffer. At the same time, there are often systemic developmental disorders, deafness, or endocrine abnormalities. Usually both eyes are affected at the same time. Its main complaint is night blindness. Patients with congenital syphilitic retinochoroidal atrophy feel night blindness in childhood.</p>
<p>Day blindness is the opposite of night blindness. That is, the patient's vision is reduced in strong light. If it is in a slightly darker place, the vision can be improved. This can often be seen in axial optic neuritis and achromatopsia.</p>

<h3>Labor Diet Survey</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>The life of workers is the most difficult. It is very appropriate to use the four words "cattle and horse life" as a metaphor. They work hard day and night, selling their blood and sweat, and the price they get is very meager, almost insufficient to maintain a basic life. Not to mention anything else, just in terms of diet, it is fortunate to not be hungry, where can we talk about nutrition?</p>
<p>According to a recent report from the Chinese Medical Association, an investigation was conducted on the diets of workers and their families in seven factories in Shanghai. The results found that the diet of child laborers was below the standard required limit in terms of both quality and quantity, and was worse than the diet of other workers. Also, the diet of workers is too high in carbohydrates, and the content of animal fat and animal protein is insufficient, and the quality is poor, which shows malnutrition.</p>
<p>People say, "Labor is sacred," which is certainly true. But when we see the living conditions of workers, we cannot help but feel chilled. The contribution of workers cannot be said to be small, but they live a hard life, or even worse than cattle and horses. Cattle and horses can hope to be full, but workers cannot get the minimum diet. Especially child laborers, who are in the process of development, their diet is worse than other workers. This can directly affect the health of workers and indirectly affect the efficiency of work.</p>
<p>Recently, we often hear people advocating "protecting workers," but to protect workers, the most important thing is to improve the lives of workers. The improvement mentioned here does not expect comfort, but only asks that they not be frozen or starved. But just this request may be difficult to achieve. Capitalists are always trying to find ways to carry out endless exploitation. They only see their own interests and do not care about the lives of workers.</p>
<p>The survey report of the Chinese Medical Association focuses on the diet of workers, which is related to physiology and hygiene and can be used for medical research, but it can also be used as a reference for those who care about the lives of workers. However, there are many aspects of the lives of workers that deserve attention. If we can conduct investigations in all aspects, it will be of great help to the improvement of workers' lives.</p>
<h3>Setting Out</h3>
<p>— Zhi Fu</p>
<p>——A New Compilation of Old History——</p>
<p>The north wind, which had been blowing continuously for three days, had stopped a large troop of soldiers entirely in the Huajiacun area, waiting for the storm to cease before they could break camp and set off.</p>
<p>This time, the battalion was preparing to be deployed to the Heishuitou area to be stationed. The day before the army set off, the battalion dispatched many soldiers to conscript able-bodied men to accompany them, even going to the villages to urge them from house to house.</p>
<p>Mulan—a young woman from Huajiacun—was sitting idly at home this day, her brow furrowed tightly, as if she had some difficult matter to resolve, sighing endlessly.</p>
<p>The surrounding air was very quiet. Suddenly, the sound of a horse bell approached from afar, and then someone knocked on her door.</p>
<p>"Who is it?" she asked outwards.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>"We are from the military camp to deliver a message," a rough voice answered from outside the door.</p>
<p>Mulan opened the door without hesitation, and she immediately saw the thick-browed man handing in the military conscription notice. His expression seemed very uneasy.</p>
<p>"The main force will set off at noon tomorrow. Your old man Hua has to return to the ranks too! If he is too old, then your brothers should go to assemble on time, without fail!" the soldier said a few words, hastily mounted his saddle, and galloped towards the hillside like a flying arrow.</p>
<p>"Alas!" Mulan sighed again, as if with some emotion, and immediately turned and ran inside. Inside, her parents hobbled out of the bedroom.</p>
<p>"Mulan! Who was that?"</p>
<p>"It was someone from the army," she said, handing the military conscription notice to her father to see.</p>
<p>Her mother looked at the old man's trembling wrist with frightened eyes, her eyes almost red and swollen.</p>
<p>"Dad! The man just now said we have to prepare to return to the ranks. I don't think you need to worry, this is for our entire country! At this critical moment of survival, the people should naturally take on their respective responsibilities. Now I have decided to disguise myself as an able-bodied man from the Hua family to follow the army on its expedition…"</p>
<p>She spoke with a face full of excitement, her willow-leaf eyebrows standing upright, and a bright flush appearing on her cheeks.</p>
<p>"You, you're crazy! How can a daughter…" her mother seemed even more panicked, trying desperately to stop her with a tearful face.</p>
<p>"…Who says a daughter can't shoulder a great mission! I, Mulan, am determined."</p>
<p>"There are many bad people in the army! You…" her father almost cried: …his throat felt like it was choked by an iron cake.</p>
<p>Mulan, however, was thinking about the preparations for the expedition. She secretly ran out of the house again and went to the market to choose a sturdy white horse, as well as bows, spears, saddles… and brought them back.</p>
<p>After half a day of careful disguise, Mulan came out of the bedroom, already transformed into a brave and martial man. Her younger brother looked at her and shouted wildly:</p>
<p>"Ah! Sister has changed her appearance! She's actually my brother now!"</p>
<p>Even her parents couldn't tell the difference at this time. He stared at her with his dim old eyes and suddenly laughed. However, when he thought that his beloved daughter would soon leave his side, a wave of bitterness welled up in his heart, and two streams of tears rolled down his cheeks.</p>
<p>"Dad! Why are you heartbroken?…" Mulan said heroically.</p>
<p>"My family is well, why do we have to… separate like this… uh!…" Her parents hugged her arms and cried loudly.</p>
<p>"What are you saying! Now that our country is about to fall, what kind of home do we have? We must do our best to drive away those barbarians, and when your daughter returns with a bloodstained sword, we will rebuild our sacred and harmonious family…!"</p>
<p>Mulan struggled to break free from her parents' embrace.</p>
<p>The two bitter hearts of the elderly were moved to stop crying. On one side, they hurriedly prepared to pack the remaining luggage for their daughter.</p>
<p>A heavy mist pressed down, and the fields of the village were shrouded in darkness. The wind seemed to have stopped as well. A clear whistle sounded in the distance, and the campfire illuminated the hillside in red. It was during this night that Mulan finally mounted her saddle and galloped away without looking back. …</p>
<p>Her parents leaned against the door of their home, watching their beloved daughter embark on a long expedition with tears in their eyes.</p>
<h3>Wind</h3>
<p>— Zheng Mingzi</p>
<p>The wind is cold and fluttering.</p>
<p>The fields began to become desolate: the rice stalks all turned yellow, and the leaves sparsely left the withered branches, falling to the ground, where passersby trampled them. In this way, they slowly rotted in the soil and disappeared. No one remembers them anymore, no one remembers the thick shade of summer! Now, the branches are bare, and there is no more laughter in the square at night. The fields are gradually becoming desolate: it is autumn.</p>
<p>The wind blows and blows, blowing the wilderness out of shape: when the season of withering arrives, nothing can escape its decline. The branches gradually become bare and withered, and even the two or three small blades of grass growing by the cracks in the stones wither and turn yellow…</p>
<p>Just as the old woman Ma in Jinjiazhen couldn't understand the hardships that this "remote corner of the world" had suffered over the years: "What exactly is going on, what evil wind has been encountered?…"</p>
<p>The old woman Ma's family had lived in Jinjiacun for at least eighty years, according to her own careful calculation on her fingers. It is said that she was brought here by her ancestors during the Taiping Rebellion, when the old woman Ma was only a six-month-old baby.</p>
<p>The family settled here, worked, and multiplied, and the days passed like that. The elderly died generation after generation, lying in the soil that their blood and sweat had irrigated, and now—according to calculations, the old woman Ma should even have great-grandchildren, and soon, perhaps, she would follow generations of ancestors and lie in the soil—however, now the old woman Ma has nothing. Her only son, nearly fifty years old, had his temperament ruined by poverty and anxiety. Every day he drank alcohol, and he never treated her with a kind voice again. "I'm about to die, and I still have to live that kind of life! What a sin, what a sin, what evil wind has been encountered…?"</p>
<p>It really seemed like they had encountered some "evil wind." The old woman Ma, who had lived for more than seventy years, had never lived through such days. In the past—even five years ago—life was much better. Her son worked in a yarn factory in Shanghai, and that year he became a "foreman," earning an extra five yuan in wages. When he returned home for the New Year, he even brought a young woman back, urging the old woman Ma to call her mother-in-law…</p>
<p>This time, the old woman Ma smiled happily. Her son had earned more money and gained a daughter-in-law. The whole family was happy. The days were getting better and better, really, it was like a peaceful world.</p>
<p>This small Jinjiacun was like a paradise isolated from the ugly world. Life was simple, and the days were light…</p>
<p>But at the end of the second year, before it was time to go home for the New Year, her son and daughter-in-law, who were working in Shanghai, both rushed back; saying that the ×× people were attacking Shanghai, the factory had stopped work, and Shanghai was in a panic.</p>
<p>However, "Shanghai" seemed so far away. The old woman Ma often heard her son talk about "Shanghai," which was a good place, but it shouldn't have had much to do with the remote Jinjiacun.</p>
<p>But, after four consecutive months, they also became anxious. It wasn't just the old woman Ma's family whose men were working in Shanghai in Jinjiacun. But sitting at home and eating away at their savings, they all couldn't hold out. In the fifth month, they hurriedly went to Shanghai to take a look: many shops and factories were no longer open, and even those that were open had reduced wages a lot. Speaking of the old woman Ma's son, he returned to his hometown three months after work resumed, saying that the factory had closed down. This time, there was nothing to do, and he had to stay at home.</p>
<p>In this way, the days became more and more difficult, and there was no way out. Losing his job, everything went wrong. Finding work again was harder than climbing to the sky. The old woman Ma's son immersed himself in alcohol every day. After getting drunk, he came back and scolded his old mother and beat his wife. The woman couldn't bear the torment, and in the third year, she quietly slipped away, leaving the helpless people in Jinjiacun living a miserable life like stray dogs: hunger, poverty, and misery…</p>
<p>"What evil wind is this!" The old woman Ma still couldn't understand: however, the world was indeed falling into a season of withering…</p>
<h3>Little Master</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>Old拉克 and蕊莎</h3>
<p>— Lin Na</p>
<p>拉克 returned from the royal city by carriage. He sat on the carriage platform, his eyes slightly closed, a pipe clenched in his mouth, appearing deep in thought. Behind him, the sunset glow was reflected in the long row of palm trees raising dust.</p>
<p>The old man was very depressed; he was thinking of home. Three years ago, there were his wife, two sons, and a daughter at home. Three years later, the situation had changed. His wife had died, his two sons had joined the Dan Niu Lan (peasant violent party) uprising, one was sentenced to permanent imprisonment, and one was in exile. Now, the only people left at home were the old man and his daughter, who was eighteen or nineteen years old. According to the habits of ordinary Filipinos, she could freely fall in love or marry, and he would have someone to rely on for the rest of his life. His daughter and son-in-law would be responsible for taking care of him in his old age, although he was confident that his muscles and bones were still strong enough to transport property from the small town to Manila, and he could also drive foreign goods from Manila back to the mountain shops in the countryside.</p>
<p>However, his daughter was so timid and indecisive since she was little. She grew up in the owner's coconut grove, and she didn't have the activeness and playfulness of ordinary girls. Many girls of her age were already walking with protruding bellies, but she hadn't even found a lover. Once, she was chased out of the coconut grove by the pursuers' love songs, her face red and ears burning, hiding in the house and crying; once, she poured a whole basin of cold water on the young singer who was serenading her under the window. It was just because she was afraid, afraid of those men and the lewd songs coming from their throats.</p>
<p>This made the old father very anxious. He believed that she would never get a lover because the young people in the village were afraid to approach her. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Opening "Three Smiles Point Autumn"</p>
<p>Luring the tiger away from the mountain is the best plan. Xiao Tang really pretended to be a scoundrel. Saying that Zhishan seduced me to go to Wuzhong. I am. Because I have received deep kindness, I dare not go. The husband listened. And was very angry. Hating the madman for doing such absurd things. You are just a scholar. Where are. Twelve hairpins lined up in two rows. It's not that I'm boasting today. There are beauties among the maids. It's okay to let the servant choose. Busy calling the housekeeper old woman. Gathering all the Mei Xiang of the mansion. Waiting to choose from the peacock screen and become a pair. Good things are always hard to come by. The luxuriant peaches and beautiful plums each present their fragrance. Only the flower king doesn't come out of the hall. Maybe it is. She hasn't had time to dress up yet. Let's choose ordinary flowers at will. Evaluating the thin swallows and fat Yangs. After selecting several people, the day is already late. Feeling listless and confused. Hongshan saw the bookboy's intention. Entered the room to discuss with his wife. The madam came up with a couplet to test the boy. Saying that it's good to wait for the red lotus to greet the summer rain. Who knows. He wants to climb the cassia tree to receive the autumn fragrance. This boy's eyesight is really strong. A pomegranate heart is anxious. The stable bottle is broken, splashing waves. Crying to death in the room and then reviving.</p>

<p>Opening "Lin the Recluse"</p>
<p>A corner of lonely mountain on the lake is green. Three hundred plum trees are planted to form a forest. What a. Lin Junfu, with a detached and distant mind. Content with a bamboo fence and thatched hut. Not stained by any dust. Not only is he studious and never seeks official advancement. But also his feet have not stepped into the city for twenty years. Plum is his wife, and the little crane is his son. It can be seen that his iron heart and proud bones are innate. In the cold weather, the crane guards the plum blossoms. It seems that the Xuan family is still filial to her mother. Plum blushed. The crane chirped in the shade. One is. The immortal beauty of the Gusha Mountain smiles. One is. The light and clear phoenix chick recites books. Occasionally, a mountain temple is visited by a distinguished guest. His slave boy releases the phoenix into the blue clouds. Only to see the dancing and whirling to welcome the master. The gentleman is. A small boat with melon skin is far from home. Better than the Tao family's young son waiting for firewood at the gate. He is skilled in calligraphy and painting. Loves to sing and recite. Saying that I don't need to leave a famous manuscript to the world. However, the sparse shadows slant across the clear and shallow water. The subtle fragrance floats in the yellow dusk. His beautiful verses have been passed down to this day. Afterwards, the king bestowed millet and silk. And changed his name to Mr. Hejing. His noble and pure name remains after his death. Saying that Maoling will seek his posthumous works in the future. Fortunately, there will be no Fengchan essay, and it can be seen that he was romantic and unrestrained in his early years, despising Zhang Qing.</p>

<p>Opening "Yingying's Heart" (Mimi Collection Issue)</p>
<p>The fragrant lotus and the blue water stir the cool breeze. The water stirs the cool breeze on a long summer day. Long summer day. Fragrant blue lotus. Miss Yingying calls Hongniang. I have nothing to do with you in the boudoir. Let's go to the back garden to relieve our boredom. Hongniang listened. And was overjoyed. Following the young lady, she moved down the stairs. Turning and winding, her body moved inward. Passing through the bamboo screen, she passed through the wooden flower trellis. Walking to the White Plum Pavilion, she stood there. Then she saw the dense trees blocking the sun. What a clever little Hongniang. She hurriedly opened the windows on all sides. The table was placed in the center. The zither was removed from the bag. Incense was burned in the treasure tripod furnace. The young lady sat down and played the zither. First, she played a tune of Xiangfei's Lament. Then, she played a tune of Phoenix Seeking Mate. After several tunes of the zither, she saw the golden crow gradually setting in the west. Hongniang was busy. Closing the windows on all sides. The zither was hung on the wall. The incense was extinguished in the treasure tripod furnace. The two mistresses returned to the boudoir. Walking along the original road. The small bridge curved and reflected the pond. Seeing two mandarin ducks playing in the pond. Ah, girl, the early summer breeze stirs the water, The water stirs the cool breeze of the summer day. Of course, the beautiful scenery is extraordinary.</p>

<h3>Water East Flows</h3>
<p>(1) The rolling Yangtze River. Flows leisurely to the East China Sea. Good spring scenery. This year it goes and next year it will be here. Although it is gone, it can come back. In the garden. White plum blossoms. Red peach blossoms. Spring is all over the branches. Sighing that youth is like flowing water that never returns. Quickly put away sorrow. It's useless to grieve. The sea is vast. The sun shines. The fog is thick. Turning into clouds. The dragon flies gracefully. The east wind blows to the hometown. It takes hard work to irrigate. Washing away the dust.</p>
<p>(2) The rolling Yangtze River. Flows leisurely to the East. Good times. An inch of time is an inch of gold, it is a waste to spend it in vain. Please don't forget. People's hearts are evil. The strong bully the weak. You must fight and not be cowardly. Willing to love the community and the country as one. If you want a rich country and a strong people, you must rely on a good conscience. Young people are busy. Studying hard. Old people are busy. Achieving a career. The older you get, the stronger you get. The predecessors planted trees, and the descendants enjoy the shade. Compatriots share. What's the harm in being busy?</p>

<h3>Introducing "Carnival Night"</h3>
<p>We dare to, with the most sincere attitude, recommend this Chinese film, a glorious work of the world, "Carnival Night" to the ladies and gentlemen who love film art.</p>
<p>"Carnival Night" is a work that shows the progress of Chinese films, and is a work that improves the technical level. Although we dare not say that it is unprecedented, we are very confident that after you watch it, you will definitely be pleasantly surprised and praise it as an exquisite work.</p>
<p>Whether it is in terms of consciousness, director's skills, photography, scenery, actors, sound recording and sound effects, or the sentences in the dialogue, there are considerable and satisfactory gains. Of course, these satisfactory gains are the crystallization of huge assets and the hard work of all the staff, but in order to give the audience spiritually beneficial food, we have never taken into account the consumption of all our money and effort.</p>
<p>This film is now scheduled to be released on October 8 at the Jincheng Grand Theater in this city.</p>
<h3>The Great Shanghai Will Screen "Queen's Martyrdom"</h3>
<p>The Great Shanghai Grand Theater will screen the great palace film "Queen's Martyrdom" by RKO Pictures around National Day. The film stars Katharine Hepburn and Fredric March, and is directed by John Ford. It tells the touching story of the life of Mary, Queen of Scots. Mary suffered misfortune in her childhood and lived in France. When she grew up, she was betrothed to the King of France as queen, but before long, the King of France suddenly died. Therefore, she had a strong desire to return home. Queen Elizabeth of England heard the news and tried to stop her in every way, but Mary finally arrived safely in her homeland in a lone boat. After returning to the country, the ministers rebelled and the siblings quarreled. Fortunately, she met Earl Bothwell, who was sincere and loyal, and her heart was slightly comforted. However, due to political reasons, she had to marry Duke Darnley. At that time, the ministers used the power of the Queen of England to conspire to rebel. Mary's secretary, Riccio, was assassinated, and Duke Darnley died in misfortune. Mary then married Earl Bothwell, but as the siege became more urgent, she had no choice but to make an alliance with the rebels and say goodbye to the Earl. Later, she was deceived and forced to abdicate to the Crown Prince. As the Queen, she was reduced to a prisoner of the steps. In prison, she tried to seek help from Elizabeth, so that she could safely arrive in England. She thought that the light would be seen again, and that she could enjoy her years from now on. Unexpectedly, the Queen of England was unpredictable and imprisoned Mary again, and sentenced Mary to death for the heinous crime of plotting to take the Queen of England's life. On the day of the verdict, Mary initially denounced the Queen of England's conspiracy, but when she learned that Earl Bothwell had died in exile, she thought that she was alone and had no interest in living alone, so all her thoughts were gone, and she calmly faced her death. The joys and sorrows in the film are really touching. The people at sea should not miss this extraordinary historical palace film.</p>
<h3>Casual Talk about the Double Xia</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>The Hebei opera in Shanghai now can be said to be at its peak, and the first people to introduce it to Shanghai, giving the general audience a good impression and gaining praise from all walks of life, are the sisters Zhu Baoxia and Zhu Zixia. Their skills can really be said to be perfect and have reached the realm of transformation. Zixia is good at playing young women, but is also proficient in young men. Baoxia, in addition to playing young women and huadan, is also good at leather flute and acrobatic martial arts. Her tone is sweet and rich, not inferior to Yushuang. She can be called the pride of Ping opera. Recently, Guan Jun, a famous playwright, specially arranged the play "Fox Fairy Fate" for the Zhu sisters. The performance was a great success, unprecedented. The play was performed for twelve days in a row, and every show was full, setting the record for the Yongji Great World and the Ping Opera Theater. It is now known that the Zhu sisters will continue to perform new plays in the coming days. The name of the play is "Qiankun Fushou Mirror". It is still written by the famous master Guan Jun. The scenes are compact, the matching is appropriate, and the Bouncing, Leather Flute, Qin Opera, and Gao Bozi are integrated into one. There is also a long joint performance. The tunes are novel and the words are elegant. Compared to "Fox Fairy Fate", it is even more exciting, and the Zhu sisters are also rushing to make new costumes for this play. The future of Ping opera will surely shine again. On the left is Zhu Baoxia's costume from the play "Fox Fairy Edge".</p>
