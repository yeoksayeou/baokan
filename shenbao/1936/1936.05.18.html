<h3 id="c20">晋省剿匪善後問題 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— 瑞</p>
<p>陝北殘匪毛澤東徐海東各股從二月十七日起突趨晋西的三交鎮乘隙陸續渡河竄擾石樓中陽離石隰縣孝義汾陽等地方晋省剿匪軍事突然緊張中央亦派大軍入晋恊剿動師十餘萬人轉戰三閱月經包圍堵剿至本月初旬匪衆漬散大部渡河竄回陝北留晉殘匪不到二三千人正由晉軍圍剿卽可全部肅淸晋綏署十四日召開治安會議决議除晋西各縣外全省從十六日起明令解嚴晉省剿匪軍事到此已吿一段落現在急應辦理的便是善後問題</p>
<p>這决共匪竄晋被擾的縣分達三十餘縣地方損失奇重晉省本來爲比較富庶的省分近年來亦受不景氣潮流的影響國民經濟崩潰農村破產祇有極少數擁有遺產的人家差可支撑這回共匪足跡所經飽掠洗刦而去碩果僅存的富戶也變爲赤貧倘使不積極講求救濟撫恤和復興災後農村的方策那麽現在所謂良民也有鋌而走險的可能重爲地方鉅患善後工作最重要的當然是　淸鄉　招撫　振濟閻錫山已令被災各縣飭速撫慰人民趕辦善後肅淸餘孽加緊政治工作以安民生同時由綏省兩署會派宣撫被匪各縣軍政大員十四日已分頭出發我們希望晋省當局不僅是官樣文章而止要能够很切實地去調查救濟使流亡早日歸來農村逐漸復興更希望中央能特別撥給一筆鉅欵做晉省善後工作的經費</p>
<p>在去年七月間共匪竄擾陝北猖獗的時候閻鍚山就主張以政治方式澈底防範曾召集防共會議議决三十多項其中最重要的工作就是把土地村有爲防共根本方法把組織農民自衛團减少失業等爲現在防共有效的辦法可惜决議甫竟未及實施而共匪已渡河竄入現在匪旣肅淸正是防共議决案實施的時機希望把土地村有研究一妥善實施的辦法先設立一模範區逐步推行其决如何使全省一百二十萬農戶一律武裝起來充實他們自衛的力量組織和訓練是個先决問題自衛力量養成後一方面可以抵抗共匪的武力掠奪同時還可以藉此保障晋省的安全確是當務之急</p>
<p>在强鄰高唱共同防共情勢之下一方面喊着經濟開發華北的聲浪垂涎那晉省蘊藏着十三萬兆噸煤礦的富量所以晉省實處於虎視鷹瞵的環境中晉省當局正需要加倍的努力以民生經濟的解决求澈底的防共以政治淸明人民自衛謀民族的生存因爲晉省危機四伏我們屬望於晉省當局者不得不更迫切了</p>
<h3 id="c21">行政人員會議閉幕　蔣院長致訓詞（續） <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>第五節的與踏實　大家都知道中國爲極貧困的國家、要待籌足經費、再來辦理事業、其勢爲不可能、所以大家必須盡量節的、盡量刻苦、使一個錢的經費能發揮二個三個錢的效用、甚至要做不花錢的事業、允其政府自去年以來、對於健全金融、極盡心力、國家經濟慚有生機、這是推行法幣政策初步的效果、但某礎畢竟還沒有確實、必須法幣的信用對內對外逐漸增高、國家經濟及一切事業纔有生路、所以今後一二年間無論中央地方、必須竭力設法鞏固法幣的信用、各省務須諒察此意、務使預算收支適合、卽或事業增加、亦必竭盡心力、善爲節的支配、不使增加預算、須知國家經濟建設未完成以前、唯有以極端的刻苦、開未來的生路、卽如蘇俄近年經濟逐漸充裕、各項事業均有鉅額經費、其實皆從數年前彼國政府人民極端節的、極端勞苦、减衣縮食、竭汗血勞力從事生產而來、我們此時情形、亦非極力節的勞苦不可、各地方今後對於經費、必須用心盡力、謀合理的支配、切不可漫無計劃、稍有浪費、所以第一必須確定本末先後、從最基本急要者入手、第二必須善用人力、以補經濟的貧乏、第三必須事事踏實、求數量與質量之相稱、卽如敎育事業、在已有基礎的國家、當然可以盡量推廣、而以我如此貧弱且基礎缺乏之國家、只有先求質量的改善、後求數量的擴充、而且就事業而言、如質量良好、卽基礎確實、數量雖少、亦能發生多量之效果、吾則祇求數多、不求質善、則雖多亦屬無益、而且有害、不僅敎育方面如此、對於保甲、過去注重推廣、今後亦宜特別注意於質的改進、總之、中國爲窮國、窮要有窮的打算、總要勞心勞力苦幹實幹、以精神補物質的缺乏、使事業能切實進行纔好、</p>
<p>第六管理與統制　現在我們地方政治、對敎養衛三者以外、允須特別注重於管理、換言之、卽應注重於紀律與秩序、故「敎」「養」「衛」三項要目以外、更須加一上「管」字、所謂「管」「敎」「養」衛」乃爲完全、」如徒知敎養衛、而不知管理、則所有敎育衛之工作基礎、必不能確實、辦理必不能一貫、結果所有工作皆不能持久、而且現代政治、如欲切實收效、無論對人對事、均不能聽其散漫分歧、如果紀律不嚴、秩序不守、决小能使敎養衛三者發生實際之效果、而適合現代之耍求、所謂「管」者、簡單言之、卽執行法紀、納民軌物之謂、唯有法度完密、部勒整齊、地方事務乃始一切就理、以上是就人事方面說明管理之必要、人事而外、還須管理生產、管理土地、管理交通、尤其是糧食與勞力、必須先注意管理二字、實爲今日行政人員唯一重要之業務、管理之方法、應從調查統計入手、必須確知區內土地戶口人力物產事業種種方面之確數與實况、加以全盤的整理與運用、而後眞能做到「人盡其才地盡其利、物盡其用、貨暢其流」的地步、爲政之道、可說不外乎此、至其最終之目的、則爲「統制」、所謂統制者並非收歸統轄或包攬辦理之意、乃對於管區內所有公私率物、無論官營民營、皆須使在主管人員統籌監督之下、預計其一定之功用與相互關係、從而斟酌損益、善爲調劑、妥爲支配、統盤籌劃、以補助其發展、而發揮其最高之效用、我敢說今日行政人員如對人對地對物對事、不知統制之理、且不得統制之道、則此種政治决不能成爲現代政治、此等行政入員亦不能成爲現代之行政人員、政治之成敗、國家之興亡關鍵、完全在此、其實此種方法、在我國古代政治組織完密時早已有此規模、有此制度、所謂「以民治民以民用民」、卽是此意、而「民有民治民享」最終目的之完成、亦必以此爲途徑、</p>
<p>以上是指示各地行政人員主要工作綱領、亦可說是今後努力之途徑和方法、此外於聽到各地行政入員報吿以後、覺得今後各地有應改進和注意之耍點甚多、現在擇要列舉如下、</p>
<p>各省所規定之中心工作不免事項太繁、結果下級人員不能件件辦好、唯有逐項點綴、以應付上級之功令、此後宜斟酌各省各區之特殊情形、减少中心工作之項目、擇其最緊要者一二項、規定下來、集中力量、限期作成、以期收確實之效果、此項中心工作之擇定、可以下列三者爲標準、（甲）就本省本區已進行有相當基礎、而亟待完成者、（乙）爲　省所最缺乏而需要者、（丙）在地域環境上特感迫切之需要者、例如西北各省宜推廣造林、豫蘇諸省宜注重開河與治水、舊有匪區內、注重土地與生產、濱海沿江各省、宜特別注重於民衆敎育與民族意識之訓練等、總須因地制宜、無論其直接間接、總使與國防最有關係者、精密擇定、切實推行、</p>
<p>各地行政人員、必須明「知與之爲取」之道理、管子有言、「知與之爲取者、得爲治之道、我們現在苦於經濟枯竭、籌費困難、卽應獎勵生產推廣合作、爲民興利、使民力民富培養充足之後、而一切事業、自有確實基礎、更切不可以興辦新政、徒爲稅收計算、各省區及各縣、必須依此宗旨、竭力實行國民經濟建設、</p>
<p>今日最大要務、一爲儲蓄、二爲生產、所謂儲蓄、不僅獎勵錢的貯蓄、應使地方人民知蓄錢不如蓄物、而且蓄物允要於蓄錢、各地貯蓄之風、應積極提倡、與設法發展、至於積物不僅積穀一項、就是一針一綫之微、均須盡量節用、多儲積、乃至廢銅破鐵亦不可隨意拋棄、均須積藏以濟國家之貧乏、至於獎進生產、各縣應切實調查當地原有之生產與工業、就地獎勵或補助、應知少量的生產、愈於不生產、卽或品質不甚優良、亦較之無生產終勝一籌、</p>
<p>吾人組織民衆與訓練民衆最善之方法、莫如從經濟方面人手、誘發人民切己之利害、使能踴躍樂從、例如辦理保甲、最好卽寓經濟意味於其間、同時提倡各種之合作社、聽說福建長樂縣爲購辦菜餅肥料、曾集資二萬元、墊借民間、到期以後、人民不但如數歸還、而且以後對於縣府政令、自動服從、增進政府之信仰、實非淺尠、保甲工作、亦因此遂能切實推進、此卽最好之實例、各地可以取法、</p>
<p>各地保安團隊、自集中省府指揮調遣之後、本區團隊不能留在本區、地方防務每受影饗、今後關於保安團隊、其經費與訓練固仍須集中於省、但同時應使本區團隊仍歸還本區、并賦予區司令或專員以調遣分配之權、</p>
<p>辦理保甲、欲求澈底收效、必須採用連坐法之精神、進一步嚴格規定並實行連帶責任制度、對於保甲長之人選、應慎重選擇、委任之後、須隨時考騐、加以黜陟、允須注意訓練、使能逐漸進步、訓練保甲長時、應授以自衛新知一書內所載之要項、及余所摘輯戚繼光語錄、</p>
<p>現在中央指定地區實施兵役法、各省廳長專員縣長、對實施兵役與徵兵、務須按照中央規定之原則與辦法、盡量協助、視爲己事、不可以此爲中央之事、推諉於師管區或團管區而忽視之、務必協同督促辦理、視爲本省本區最重要之基本工作、</p>
<p>現在各地散匪、雖已逐漸肅淸、但仍不可有絲毫忽略、總須澈底淸除、斬草除根、勿使有一個土匪存留於本區之內、須知如存留一個匪類、卽可逐漸蔓延、爲後來之大患星火燎原、江西匪患可爲殷鑒</p>
<p>淸勦匪患、當在社會與政治之得力、而不宜專恃兵力進勦與淸勦之程度、完全不同、進勦之法可應用七分政治三分軍事之原則、而淸勦之時、只可用一分軍事、而須賴九分政治之力也、望切實研究各種之方法、凡保甲偵探交通訓練、必須按照實際情形、研究種種方法、而於自衛新知一書內所舉之各項特別是論「準備」一章、允須切實注意、以充實自衛之力量、與防匪禦匪之設備、總之必須在人口極少交通極不使利之地方、乃始應用少數兵力、其他地區、應注力於軍事以外之工作、以輔軍事勦匪之完成、</p>
<p>關於訓練壯丁之科目、軍事還在其次、第一應授以現代國民應有之常識、使明瞭現代世界大勢、國家地位、國民責任等等、第二應訓練其公德心、使知公共秩序之宜尊重、公共利益之宜保持、公共衛生之宜遵守、並啟發其勞動服務、互助合作、爲公犧牲之精神、將來中央並宜編發一種公民訓練常識課本、以爲各地訓練之依據、</p>
<p>無論辦理保甲、訓練壯丁民衆、必須先從訓練幹部入手、幹部如果健全、便能發生以一人敎好百入千人之力量　所以訓練之時、還須注意選擇、任用之後、并須隨時考察、此外對於淸匪察奸、均應注重偵探之工作、對偵探人員、宜有特殊訓練、組成偵探網通信網、實施各種通信瞭望聯絡等方法、並應隨時監察、勿使發生有名無實與陽泰陰違之弊、</p>
<p>各地行政專員、應與縣黨部及區黨部密切聯絡、注意靑年有爲之黨員、召集訓練、用其專長、使分任編組保甲、訓練民眾、並偵探工作、獎勵黨員與一般靑年奮鬥積極之精神、使爲各地基本工作而服務、於推動政治、必有莫大效果、此外對於當地學校、亦須高設法打成一片、以收共同推進之效、</p>
<p>各地今後對於國民體育及社會之公共衛生事項、均應特別注重、獎勵推進、視爲行政要務、以增進國民之健康與體格、對於公共衛牛、首宜勵行淸潔與預防疾病、無論城區鄉村、如有未埋之棺木、卽宜掩埋入地、並獎勵各地籌建公墓、</p>
<p>關於維持秩序與减少游惰事項、首宜注意者三事、一、必須注意囚犯之處置與訓練、所有囚犯、勿使集中於大城市以內、亦不可任令閉置囚所、不加管理、宜分少年壯年老弱各類、分別施以訓練、並授與工作、特別注重其生活與衛生、各專員巡視各縣、必先檢察監獄、對本縣之監獄、每月必須親自檢查二决、日須臨時定期前往查視、勿使管獄人員得有掩飾欺蒙之機會、二、必須注意於游民乞丐之管理與戚化、妥籌安置之方法、三、必須注意各地傷兵之狀况與處置、允不可使傷兵久居於省城及都市附近各地、除中央已安置之傷兵以外、其他未盡之處、務由地方長官妥爲安置於適當地點、并與各師團管區司令共同設法訓練、切實管理之、</p>
<p>各地修治河川、大體上均能努力進行、河南省各區修河甚多、但惜無統一計劃、結果發生此段已修而彼段未修之弊病、例如河流經過甲乙丙三個行政監察區域、如上流之一段浚治甚深、而中間之一段屬於另一區者、依然淤淺、則必致發生更嚴重之水患、所以此後浚河工作應以整個河流爲單位、由省府建設廳訂定整個修治之工作計劃、發交各區實行、勿任各地以地區爲單位、乃可以興水利而免流弊、</p>
<p>各地造林工作、首宜注意推廣苗圃、允以豫魯陝三省、必須盡量推廣苗圃、五年內各省每縣至少每年推廣數十畝、培養苗木、添置森林、下年度各專員來京會議時、對於推廣苗圃及添置森林之面積數量、及木材種類、必須有詳細報吿、</p>
<p>各地修路、往往有僅築路基、卽以修築完成報吿、而並未將橋梁或涵洞一律建成者、如此雖有公路、而依然不能使用、今後修路、務須將橋梁工作計算在內、無論計劃施工、或報吿工作、均不能將橋梁忽略、</p>
<p>關於土地行政、此决會議已有討論、無論辦理測量、或土地陳報、各省均應視爲目前最要之政務、切實舉辦、允須明瞭吾人之目的、不在於增加稅收、而實在於以整理土地與改良土地以為實行平均地權之張本、蓋必先完成整理土地與改良之工作、確知土地之實况、而後可談到士地之處分、所以現階段之整理士地的工地之處分、所以現階段之整理土地的工作、各省必須排除萬難、加緊完成、</p>
<p>現在各省對於行政督察專員之轄區、有以第一第二等數目字名區者、亦有以地域命名者、名稱上殊不一律、此後宜劃一名稱、一律以數目字標明之、</p>
<p>上面所說各點、都是就實際工作中指出應行改進或注意之處、今天限於時間、還不及一一列舉、以後可隨時指示、總之、大家在各地擔任行政工作、欲求切實收效、必須隨處留心、遇事省察、發現錯誤立卽改正、以求進步、對於奉行政令、必須瞭解精義、講求方法、竭力避免形式上敷衍之弊病、減輕書面塡寫報吿等工作、多作實地考察的工夫、更應力求時間人力與財力之經濟、謀一切支配之合理通力合作、化除界限、互相輔助、互相調劑、更能獎進才能、考察部屬、嚴明賞罰、則事無不舉、必能以少數的時間與人才、辦好很多的事業、</p>
<p>此外更有一點、本席感覺得與國家興亡有特別重大的關係的、就是敎育、我們今後若不能將敎育澈底改善、將擔負敎育責任者之地位與品格、盡量提高、則一切救國工作、皆將無從着手、勞而無功、本會議對於推行義務敎育民衆敎育等、已經决定很多的辦法、祇待大家分別推行、不過本席覺得敎育上根本急要之問題、遼不在於制度辦法與經費、而實在於師資、欲提高師資、必須特別注重於人格、凡有敎人之責之學校敎師等、無論大之在一國一省、小之在一鄕一鎭、均不僅爲一個學校內之先生、而實在是全社會所仰望尊敬之師長、中國從前之所謂經師人師、如書院山長以及鄉邑塾帥、大都負一時之重望、爲一般所敬畏、司轉移風氣振作人心之責任、所以必須具有淸正高尚之風格、有自强不息之修養、剛毅不屈之精神、守道崇義、不避危害、凡遇非常橫逆之來、或事變不測之際、允必堅忍强毅、不屈不阿、足爲後生之楷模、社會所效法、當此風氣偸薄、人心浮蕩、禮義不明、廉恥道喪的時候、我們要挽救國難、必先挽回人心、轉移風氣、欲達此目的、允賴學校敎師修德勵行、以挽回世運自任、允其各省之敎育廳長及各縣之敎育科長等、在從前時代都是爲士林表率的學官、更應該以品格節操、刻自砥礪、須知敎育行政、實爲奮鬥救國之基本工作、負敎育行政之責任者、必須具有守正不撓、與不避危難、犧牲一切之精神、方足以率導羣倫、廉頑立儒、而克盡敎育之職責、所以對於各地敎育、必須負起責任、不辭勞怨、貫澈國家敎育之政策、改革敎育界因循苟且與散漫凌亂之風氣、對於敎育之整頓與管理、必須善善惡惡、激獨揚淸、爲國家爲靑年負起全部之責任、現在各地敎員、自强自重、不媿靑年師表者固然很多、但因循敷衍、或遷就學生迎合靑年、只求保持個人地位、不惜喪失師道尊嚴者、亦所在多有、此種放棄責任自私自利之敎師、不但自貶入格、實足貽神聖的敎育事業以汚點、更有甚者、竟至利用靑年之弱點、視爲把持搗亂之工具、以謀個人之出路、此種誤人子弟之行爲、實與出賣民族永久之利益無異、其罪惡實允勝於賣國之漢奸、充其禍害、足以斷送吾次代國民、而陷中華民族於萬刦小復之境、本席認爲復興國家、完全以敎育爲基本、如敎育不良、一則切政治上之努力、均將等於虛擲、所以特別提出來、希望負有責任者切實負責、加以改正、一方面挽救頹風、一方面整頓師資、然後敎育方足以救國、而不至於以敎育亡國、這一段話、不僅希望各敎育廳長切實注意、也希望到會的各級行政人員加以充分的注意、總之、今日國家的艱危、不是言語所能罄述、大家旣然抱定爲國奮鬥的决心、致力於政治工作、務必認淸國家所處的環境、與自身所負的時代使命、全體一致、下定决心、爲打破非常的難關而努方、吾人最大之目的、在完成現代的國家之建設、今後一切政治設施、均應切合於此要求、方足以達到復興民族之使命、希望各位本此努力、益求進步、庶明年再行集會時、咸能表現更大更佳的成績、這是本席深切的期望、</p>

<p>— 國立編譯館專任編譯陳可忠</p>
<p>我國煤產　世界第三位，可惜沒有充分的利用。據調査所得，煤的消費，家庭用的佔百分之43，2，工廠用的佔百分之32，6，交通用的佔百分之8，4，煤鑛自己用的佔百分之8。這樣看來，中國大部份的煤都用於直接燃燒，甚爲可惜。我國只有河北井陘這一個地方，有煉焦的工廠，提取副　物，但是產量很少，前途也難以樂觀。</p>
<p>關於藥物問題　煤膏的產物很多，藥物也是其中重要產物的一部份，如像苦酸是一種很好的黃色染料，同時也是一個極好的大傷防腐劑。由煤裹面提製藥物，在六十年前已經有人發明了，醫如在一八七叫年德國化學家Kolbe曾由煤啻裏向蒸發川來石炭酸，製成水楊酸，可以用來醫治羊癎瘋。假使再加醋酸酐就可以做成治頭痛的阿司匹靈，但是在利用煤膏以前，化學家已經發明了很多重要的藥，如像一八三一年德國著名化學家Liebig用漂白粉同酒精化台，發明了氯仿。我們知道氯仿是一種麻醉劑，病人在開刀的時候，一定要用的。從前有許多傷兵受了傷以後不是成了殘廢就是死亡，自從氯仿發明後，不知道解救了人類多少的痛苦同死亡，還有一種外科常用的麻醉藥，就是醚（以脫），這個東西，是在十三世紀發明的，但是牠的麻醉的效用，直到一八四二年才經人發現。在這幾百年中間，因爲沒有麻醉藥，不知道有幾千萬人枉受了刀圭的痛苦，這也足以證明醫藥必須同化學合作，才會進步。關於催眠藥，先前發明一種是三氯乙醛（Chloral），不過這種藥品，對於人體，往往有別的不好的作用，後來經過化學家的研究，又發明了Veronal和Sulphonal，這兩種藥，仍奮是有毛病的，因爲久服會成癮，現在化學家又發明了Luminal同Adalin，牠們有上面幾種催眠藥的效力而毒性則大爲减少。還有像天然產生的古柯鹼（Cocaine），從前用爲局部麻醉藥，但是這種藥品好像嗎啡，有劇毒，而且一經試用，就會成癮，所以爲了避免這種缺點，化學家就發明了Encaine和Novocaine。為兩種藥，都比原來的天然產品好得多，從前外科手術須用全體麻醉，現在可以代以局部麻醉，這都是化學家對於醫學上的貢獻，還有一種藥，是在一九〇一年發明的副腎素（Adrenaline）。這藥的用處很多，效力極大，在外科方面，倘使病人注射了這藥，能够把身體的血管壓縮，使打進去的地方的血液，完全跑開，結果醫生　刀的時候，可以不見血。這種藥品是由動物腎臟上面的一種腺提取出來的。據說耍提取一磅的副腎素，須有兩萬隻的牛才够用，這是何等花錢和殘忍的事，但是現在化學家　經知道道藥的構造，所以能够用人工方法大景製造。我國對於藥材的歷史發源很久，不過以前都不會用科學方法去研究改良，所以幾千年來一無進展，最近才有人用新的化學方法上研究。過去已經研究得有很好結果的，有麻黃，當歸等等。像這樣的研究，將　的希望很大，我們應該多多的努力。自從西洋醫藥輸入我國以後，中西醫藥的爭論，一直到現在還沒有停止。我們平心而論，中國醫藥所根據的學理和方法有許多是很可非議的，但是中醫治病所用的藥，是很値得研究，不能一筆抹殺。假使我們能用科學方法去研究中國的藥，我們相信將來這兩方面的隔膜，自有煥然冰釋的一日。</p>
<p>關於化學兵器問題　上面所講的都是有福利於人類的化學。關於破壞這一方面化學所顯示的威力，也非常偉大。現代的兵器如像製造槍砲的鋼鐵，飛機所用的合金，一切的火藥毒氣，燃料，沒有一件不依靠化學工業。爲明瞭起見，現在把關於道方面的化學貢獻，的略向大家講一講：</p>
<p>鋼鐵同合金　關於這個問題，因爲時間的關係，不能詳細討論，但是有一兩點，不妨吿訴各位一下。第一是我國對於鋼鐵的產量，非常薄弱，鐵鑛的儲量本不豐富，而且大部分鐵鑛的開採和提煉，都在外人的掌握中。煉鋼的事業，要是幼稚。現在把世界鋼鐵的產量（一九三三年）列成簡單的表，來比較一下，大家就知道我的鋼鐵的問題，是何等嚴重的。</p>
<p>第二關於飛機的製造，鋁是很重要的原料，我們現在只提倡飛機救國，但是我們要知道飛機的生命很有限，世界上無論那個國家，如果不設法自己製造的話，提倡航空這個口號，都是白喊了。製造飛機所必需的鋁，可以從明礬提煉出來，這種明礬在我國蘊藏得很多，據中央研究地質調査所的調査，浙江平陽礬石的儲量有三萬萬噸之多，說起來要算世界最豐富的礬鑛。如果我們能够設法用很經濟的方法，將明　裹面的鋁提取出來，這於國防上實在有不少的益處。現在黃海化學工業社，中央研究院，都在努力研究，不久以前實業部的地質調査所，和中華化學工業研究所，也有人研究這個問　，將來研究成功，不僅鋁的問題得以解决，就是肥料問題，也可以解决一部分，因爲明礬裏面除了鋁外，還含有肥料所必需的鉀。</p>
<p>火藥問題關於火藥這方面，大家都知道最初用的火藥都是黑藥，爆炸時要發生很多的墨烟，後來經過化學家的逐漸改良，到了現在，火藥的種類很多，而且牠們的威力，都是非常偉大。現在我把火藥幾種重要的發明，向大家介紹一下：第一種主要發明，是在一八四六年在瑞士的德國化學家Schonbein所發明的硝化棉。棉花經硝酸及硫酸處理後，就變成硝化纖維素。這種硝化纖維，含氮的百分之12，3，燃燒後沒有烟，破壞力很大，遠非從前的黑藥所能比例。因爲燃燒後不發烟，所以這藥叫做無烟火藥。第二種主要發明，是在一八四七年意大利化學家Sobrero　所發明的硝化甘油，把甘油用硝酸和硫酸的混合物處理後，就可得到這種東西，道種火藥，非常容易爆炸，如果不想方法改良，這藥是很難應用的。不久瑞士Nobel偶然發見矽藻土，能够吸收硝化甘油，轉運　無危險，我們平常所聽到的炸藥（Dynamite），就是這種吸收硝化甘油的矽藻土。後　Nobel　父偶然發明硝化棉花同硝化甘油，可以製成一種膠質物品，這種炸藥，旣便運輸而爆炸力父極偉大，比較硝化棉花或硝化甘油，還要厲害得多。此外還有兩個可怕的炸藥：第一個就是苦酸，由石炭酸經硝酸硫酸處理後，就可得到。我們上面講過，苦酸是很好的消毒劑和染料？同時也是一個很好的炸藥。第二個是T.N.T.。我們蒸餾煤膏，就可得到一種產物，名叫甲苯（Toluene），能够燃燒，經硝酸處理後，就變成T.N.T.。這種炸藥不易着火，平時卽受衝擊，也不會爆炸，但是一經爆發，牠的破壞能力，却非常偉大。現在各國所有的炸藥，種類雖然很多，但是基本的炸藥，不外這幾種。由上面所講的看來，火藥一定要用硝酸。硝酸的來源，在歐戰以前，差不多都是由智利硝製成，歐戰後硝的供給，就從取之不盡用之不竭的空中的氮，製造出來。歐戰的時候，聯軍方面極力設法斷絕德國氮的供給，但是德國因爲有了　Haber　空中取氮的方法，雖然遭了封鎖，氮的來源仍舊不斷。假使當時德國沒有Haber空中取氮的發明，我們相信聞戰後不消一年，德國就要敗下來的。</p>

<p>浙江紹興海寗等處春蠶、業已先後上簇、嘉興平湖等處、則已大眠、各絲廠商餘繭商、經浙江蠶絲統制委員會登記合格、在浙省各地收買春繭者、給興等處於今日起已出發佈置、明後日卽開秤收繭、嘉興平湖等處亦已華備出發、江蘇無錫溧陽等處、春蠶亦將大眠、各繭行已定二十五日左右開秤收繭、</p>

<p>絲廠準備開工</p>
<p>近年華絲國外貿易、受日絲傾銷影響、以致價格暴跌、銷路大减、繭子價格隨之低落、影響農民生計、自去年秋季起外銷起色後、絲價回漲、但因連年衰落，繭子產額减少、所以滬浙錫各地絲廠、均感原料缺乏恐慌、而被迫停工者踵起、以上海而言、絲廠勉强開工者、目前僅福綸等六家、俟新繭上市後、滬錫浙和地絲廠、將有大批開工繅絲、</p>

<p>一年一度之白虹·日僑·俄僑三角田徑對抗賽本年度已於昨日下午時在時橋路同文書院角逐、該賽第一屆錦標為白虹所得、上屆被日僑保持、本屆三方實力相等、競爭劇烈異常、俄僑賴人才平均、以六十四分得本屆錦標、白虹因多數健將或缺席或受傷、未能出場致以五十一分屈居第二、日僑以四十六分居殿軍、昨賽各項成績、異常精彩、允以鉛球一項、俄僑卡張以十二公尺九八破該會紀錄、並破遠東日本阿部功所保持之十二公尺九零五紀錄、實爲大會最美滿之收穫、同時千五百公尺鐵餅及跳高等均破該會最高紀錄、茲將昨賽全部成績誌下、</p>
<p>全部成績</p>
<p>百公尺</p>
<p>因參加角逐人數過多、分兩組預賽、第一組我方由新自馬來亞來滬之名將傅金城出馬、一舉成功、十一秒一平該會紀錄、第二組白虹葉嵩平亦衝刺有力、以十一秒七獲得首席、惟較第一組成績、略爲遜色、迨决賽時、傅金城一馬當先、葉嵩平緊隨不捨、俄僑卡張亦形勢洶洶、跟隨左右、傅金城卒以資格老練、一路領先、首破白綫、葉賴最後猛衛居亞軍、相差第三僅二三公尺、亦云險矣</p>
<p>四百公尺</p>
<p>我方主將曾榮忠缺席、由吳子靜廖金海陳明良出場、槍聲起後、日僑宮川先聲奪人、吳廖陳三將左右緊跟、一圈過後、（全國三百公尺）俄僑卡張從人業中竄出嶄露頭角、此時俄將牙赫突司、亦超越餘子、列入第三、結果越將卡張、先日僑一肩、首衝底錢、白虹吳子靜亦　勇超出、牙赫突司得第三、</p>
<p>千五公尺</p>
<p>白虹因主將邱宗臣腿部受傷、未下場、乃改由徐彥博、顧惠元、萬金生出席、日僑村岡先發制人、長纔放遠鷂、華將顧徐萬目後相隨、三圈過後、仍未變動、至四圈時、徐彥傅則越顧惠元而超前、但仍未能與日將村岡一併、村岡乃得從容抵達終點、徐彥博相差的三十公尺、後顧惠元萬金生賴最後術刺、始獲第四、</p>
<p>五千公尺</p>
<p>日方仍由村岡出場、我方則由老將陳虛舟周如泉王汝霖應戰、然實力遜人一籌、開賽後、日將村岡一路領導、周如泉陳虛舟在後相從、俄將切切諾夫則在黃汝霖之後、五圈過後、名次已漸分明、惟各將仍未變更地位、九圈後村岡已拋棄諸將達一圈之多、我方王汝霖用出全力、超越周陳二老將而前、結果村岡始終領先、首達終點、王汝霖第二、俄僑切切諾夫追出周如泉升入第三、</p>
<p>鐵球</p>
<p>俄將實力雄厚、白虹由全運健將劉　峯關宏達鮑家棵參與角逐、三鄕後、日方已全部淘汰、第四挪俄普闊費夫進展第一、卞張則屈居普後、我方劉景峯亦相當進步、第五擲卡張施　神力、以十二公尺九八破遠東紀錄、爲大會生色不少、普關費夫則仍保持原有地位、惟賴斜夫竟以十二公尺〇八、超出劉景峯之十二公尺〇七五而晋升季軍、第六擲各無進展、</p>
<p>鐵餅</p>
<p>仍爲俄僑淸一色之局面、未三回合、我方主將谷昭等均遭淘汰、俄將卡張勇冠三軍、每次擲出、均有進展、賴斜夫亦仗其神力、於第四擲中、竟達三十四公尺八七之紀錄、破大會紀錄、卡張無聲無色、於第五擲時竟超出賴斜夫、成　爲三十五公尺五三、同破大侖紀錄、其餘無甚變動、</p>
<p>標槍</p>
<p>標槍一項、原爲日俄之囊中物、日方主將加籐、聲勢驚人、首即以四九公尺二十、遙遙佔先、後俄將索格林於第五投擲時奮力順風擲去、竟達四九公尺三十五、超出加籐、白虹王學武谷昭兩將、亦於此時有動人表演、王學武人四八公尺四十些微之差、屈居第三、谷昭則以四八公尺三十八落於王後、</p>
<p>跳高</p>
<p>跳躍爲日方固有之國技、詎料昨竟一蹶不振、當橫木升至一公尺七五時、日方遠運健將澤村、白虹蔣懷仁同時落選、周世釗李靈中賴斜夫雖跳過、但加至一公尺八十時俄將普闊費夫一躍而過、周李賴均不得越、遂分列第二、普則仍升加至一公尺八五試跳成績、究因實力不及未過、按普周李賴四將成績、同破大會紀錄、</p>
<p>跳遠</p>
<p>日方由名將大久保出場、白虹則由張申如葉嵩平朱洪琪應敵、第一跳日大久保即得六公尺五六、葉張朱三將均未踏正步伐、致各號成績、第二第三兩跳、張申如得六公尺四十、奪得决賽權、第四跳張已大有淮展、成績六公尺四七、結果大久保以六公尺六十獲首席、餘兩跳均無特殊進展、惟張申如及日將伊籐競爭最爲劇烈、</p>
<p>三級跳</p>
<p>白虹蔣懷仁等因腿受傷、致臨時放棄、僅由張申如黃家序出場、三跳過後、張及黃同時淘汰、乃存日俄競爭局勢、俄將普闊昆曲夫於第五跳大顯身手、竟得十三公尺六六、壓倒餘蘇、維居首席、其餘二三四名、俱爲日僑包辦、成績亦頗爲接近、</p>
<p>撐竿跳</p>
<p>白虹因名將符保　赴平受訓致人才缺乏、乃選朱洪琪及徐心潛下場抵抗、徐竟按時未到、朱未三回合亦遭落選、故爲日俄雙方角逐、橫木至三公尺卅時、日將高橋小山實力不濟、同告淘汰、致冠亞兩軍、遂入俄僑之手、成績尙屬不差、</p>
<p>四百接力</p>
<p>在未賽前、以實力探討、白虹實最眞優勢、比賽後、白虹第一棒葉嵩平、出發較慢、致至第二棒時、落後於日僑、幸陳永福接棒跑來、超越日俄而前、第三棒日俄接棒不慎、同時跌倒、孫惠培乃乘機趕上、末棒傅金城勢如兎脫、轉瞬已達於終點、第二日僑、第三俄僑、</p>
<p>千六百異程接力</p>
<p>最富競爭興趣之千六百異程接力、爲大會之壓軸賽、白虹陳明良首跑二百公尺、賴衝刺得力、佔先日僑二三公尺、第二棒四百公尺李厚達、因接棒較遲、與日俄並肩而進、抵達第三棒時、亦領前一公尺、第三棒八百公尺邱宗臣、以輕鬆之步伐、二圈後已領導日俄而進、的拋棄後方二十公尺、末棒二百公尺孫惠培、接棒在奔、已領前二三十公尺、亞軍日僑、殿軍俄僑、</p>

<p>— （醉樵）</p>
<p>紅柳綠，水秀山明，一派大好春光，眞够令人陶醉，所以東也發起組織遊覽，西也發起集團旅行，好像一個寳貴的春天，切不可將它輕輕放過了！何况「人生須及時行樂」，自古已然呢。</p>
<p>「春」，的確是爲任何人所頌揚鼓舞的一個節令。</p>
<p>光陰如白駒過隙，轉瞬間，爲入們留戀的春天，已悄悄地隨着落花流水，無言而去了，躺在鴨絨毯上的人們，你們作何戚想？</p>
<p>「一年之計在於春，」如今春巳去了，誰又留得春住？試反省自身一年中的計劃，是吾已建立了基礎！——朋友：</p>
<p>櫻桃兒紅了熟了，白糖梅子上市了，筍與蠶豆都已上了台盤。我們在飽啖之餘，想到「時乎時乎不再來！」也該毛骨悚然吧！大家不要以爲今天過去，還有明天，明天過去，還有後天啊；朋友：一個人的靑春，一生能有幾何呢！</p>
<h3 id="c182">梅子 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>老爺們，太太們，上名勝之區，鍳賞了一下子桃花，回家休息了不多時，弄裏的小販們，苦孩子們，已逼尖着啞澀的喉嚨，在呌賣着「白糖梅子呀」了。白糖梅子，的呼聲在耳中，鑽進去，却很奇妙的從舌根子裏，催出了一陣潮膩膩的饞涎沫來。曹孟德行軍缺水，命軍士望梅而止渴，我想若是在軍中，命人大喊三聲「白糖梅子呀」，雖在沙漠之中，大家或許也儘能舌尖兒上，生出津液兒來呢。</p>
<p>靑梅肉，味苦而澀，靑年婦女，最愛吃，據我們鄉間，手上的小指甲，養着有三寸長，而湛精醫理的老先生說，靑梅這東西，稍吃一二枚，是頗有益於消化的，但多吃了，因爲有收斂的關係，所以很不宜於生理的發育，所以老先生們，見十五六歲的大姑娘們，摘食着靑梅，總是先咽下了一口涎沬，而緩緩地說道，「少吃幾枚罷，吃多了，將來生不出孩子，那才有得打飢荒呢。」但這種話，自然是不被大姑娘所歡迎的，所以任何一個大姑娘，聽老先生們這麽說着，總報之以一個大白眼，而咕囉着，「你要說，我偏要吃。」一邊說，一邊又故意摘食着一個，然後才扭着股兒，很不好意思地走開去。究竟靑梅這東西，是有益於入身，抑有害於人身，我希望科學家們，有以吿我。</p>
<p>梅子的用途，在從前，靑的，不過是供小兒女們的牛啖，熟的，呌做黃梅子，普通都是和着砂糖，紫蘇，桂花等，煎煮着，製成梅醬，或是和着糖與桂花，醃漬着，名爲桂花梅子。都是很好的家庭農產製造品。此外，還有用鹽醃漬着的靑梅兒，呌做風雨梅。這名兒，是挺有詩意的，味兒也不錯，爽脆是其特點。我還記得在兒時，把成熟着的黃梅子，揉搓得極軟，揭去一蓋，擠掉了梅核，撮些糖末在裏而，用洗凈的黃魚嘴骨，（鏟形的），鏟着吃，很是好玩。其名呌做「梅醬缸」不過在從前，梅的製造法，雖很多，但大率都是各家庭中製造一些兒，供自己家庭中享用的。自從近代的製造工業勃與，陳皮梅風行之後，梅的用途便一天廣似一天了。</p>
<p>梅的用途，一天廣似一天，各處的梅園，便也一天多似一天，老爺太太們，欣賞梅花的興緻自然也便一天高似一天了，這或許也是救濟農村的一助吧</p>
<p>和平之　説：不得了，現代的戰爭居然利用我了。</p>
<h3 id="c183">櫻桃 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>

<p>櫻桃已上市了，一顆顆，一粒粒，怪逗人愛的，是以見之於古今人吟詠者，不勝述；而尤以昔宮禁中視此爲時新果品，非常可貴，有宮詞可證。</p>
<p>宋王禹玉有詞詠之云：「燕子初來語更新，一聲聲報內家春。遙聞春苑櫻桃熟，先進金盤奉紫宸。」按櫻桃旣熟，必先進至尊，足見名貴，其證一。又唐王建宮詞云：「白玉窗前起草臣，櫻桃初赤賜嘗新；殿頭傳語金階遠，因進辭來謝聖人。」張文昌宮詞云：「黃金桿撥紫檀敲，絃索初張調更高；盡理昨來新上曲，內官簾外送櫻桃。」味這二詞，櫻桃特賜，似乎是一種異數；前者所以慰詞臣起草之勞，後者乃是潤宮人歌喉之澀。這又可證櫻桃之足珍，其證二。</p>
<p>因爲櫻桃這樣名貴，宮人中有以此賭輸贏的；也有因貪嘴得病而遭遺歸，致窘迫無聊的。王建宮詞中又有二首記之：記賭的一首是，「分明閒坐賭櫻桃，收卻投壼玉腕勞；各把沉香雙陸子，局中鬭累阿誰高！」記貧嘴得病的一首是，「因吃櫻桃病放歸，三年著破舊羅衣　內中侍從來還去，結得金花上貴妃。」從這二詞參互觀之，櫻桃的怪逗人愛，也不必再辭費了。</p>
<p>還有，櫻桃花開於夏曆二月，唐人嘗宴新進士於花下，謂之「櫻桃宴。」這與一雁塔題名」同稱爲一時韻事；而新進士一種得意之狀，亦不難想像得之。</p>

<p>桑果這東西，大的在大都市中的先生女士們，是沒有見到過吧！牠的滋味，當然不能知道。我在我的故鄉時，却年年見到；並且也曾嘗到。它雖不能有像柑，橙，波羅蜜等的受着都市人們的靑眼；可是在鄉村內，却也得到小孩子們的喜愛。</p>
<p>記得是十一二歲吧！和暖的春天，已偷偷的溜跑。而炎熱的夏季，却又將降臨的時候。我同故鄉的鄰居小孩，携着手，晒着日光，走到近處的桑園中；爬上樹梢，揀着果實纍纍的樹枝，把兩足挾着樹枝，開始大嚼。然而這果實纍纍的地方，往往是在樹的梢頭，而且數目也是很少，所以全靠各人自己本事是吾高强，而能吾佔得便宜，然而我們這一隊，却同人家兩樣，這也爲的是我們相處久長，感情較好。所以常常互相帮助。且在飽腹後，還要揀紅而變爲紫黑色的大果實。摘下帶回家去獻給老入家嘗嘗啦！</p>
<p>桑果爲桑樹的果實一稱桑椹，它是由無數小形果實集合而成，形似棗子，在成熟時，色紅而發黑，所以我們大嚼之後，嘴唇上好像塗着口脂，紅紅的大大的彷彿舊小說中吃人的魔鬼。</p>
<p>桑椹的汁水，能染布，染白布作紫色；再以不傷布的酸性水，如梅子水，淡醋等洗之，變爲紅色，以鹻性水如肥皂水，石灰水，蘇打水，灰水等洗之，則變爲靑色，靑色者，可以硫黃氣薰白，紅色者，先以鹻性水洗之，先變爲靑色，再以硫黃薰之變白。</p>

<p>第一回　品茗作淸談夜窗聽雨　折枝驚艷影花巷流芳</p>
<p>這個時候，再要到平山家去留句話，然後回學堂去，時候就太晚了。好在平山昨晚上留了話，下午一定在家裏等候，那也就不必事先到他家去了。站在道小巷子裏躊躇着，脚步未免緩一點，笑着跳着，那幾個折杏花的小孩子，也跟着來了。國器又想着，便是這幾個小孩子，也認得我，他們天眞爛漫的，什麽話也會叫出來的，那是多麽不方便。如此一轉念，也不願停留，自到學堂裏去了。在學堂裏經過了大半天，便下課了。往日下課，或者找同事談談話，或者到閱報室裏看看報，總要躭擱很久。今天下了課，他就出了學校門了。平山咋晚所訂的的會，無論怎麽樣，是不能再誤的，把上午所經過的幾條巷子，現在就重新溫習起來。到了有杏花的那條巷子，把脚步走得極慢，遠遠地就賞鑒着這伸出粉墻的半樹杏花。正好西落的太陽，向這紛墻上斜照着，將這一堵粉墻，半樹杏花，添了無限的嫵媚。於是將兩手背在身後，向杏化出神。這巷子到了下半天，是充分的幽靜了，除了國器一人之外，這裏是並沒有第二人經過。國器對巷子兩頭都張望了一番。再背了手，慢慢的史向巷子那頭走去。但是不知不覺之間，是傳染了那姑娘的毛病，走兩步，又回頭看看。那鵝蛋式的臉，點漆似的眼珠，窄小而長的花格子布衣，一一都現在眼前。同時，鼻子裏也嗅到一陣香氣。這香氣是很醉人的，讓人嗅到，就知道有一位幽靜的少女在面前。立刻張眼看時，並非是有少女由這裏經過，却是一個花兒匠，挑一擔鮮花過去了。等那花擔子挑遠，自己便笑了起來。心念這眞台了文人形容人的話，一見傾心，色授魂與了。道完全是自己一點痴心，把一個猛可見面的人，當了桌上的維納絲。雖然，實在也不容自己不想，他是太像那個維納斯了。在一個人想事想到深沉之處，那是身外一切的事情，都可以不知道的。國器也是這樣，很不經意的，依了人家的墻脚，緩緩兒的走。那一陣細微的香氣，這時又送到了鼻子裹來，這一條巷子，也並沒有花圃花市，那裹有許多桃花的經過。抬頭看起米時，這一驚非同小可，心房亂跳着，正是早上所遇的那位女學生，又由這裹經過了，那烏光輕鬆的辮子，細條兒花格子布褂子，褂子鈕扣上，掖了一條長長的白手絹，都像上午的情形一樣。不過他不像如上午那樣，是迎面而來的，現在是背過身去，只留一個後影子在人眼面前。國器雖是看到了，却不能跟了後面走，不由得在那黃昏的太陽光裹，有點不知道向那方面走了。（二二）</p>

<p>關於飲茶的起源，我國由來已久，但考查史籍所載，則可知飲茶的流行實始於晋而盛於唐：然而唐人陸羽却曾有茶經之著，他說：「茶之為飲，發乎神農，聞於魯周公，齊有晏嬰，漢有楊雄司馬相如，吳有韋曜（吳志韋曜傳，密賜茶荈以當酒。）晋有劉琨，張載，遠祖納謝安左思之徒，皆飲焉。滂時侵俗，盛於國朝兩都並荆兪間。」讀了這段記載，對於飲茶的歷史大槪可以明瞭了。至於他說發乎神農，那因爲相傳神農是我國遍嘗百草的祖師，所以附會到茶葉亦是經他嘗過了才發明的。</p>
<p>蓋茶葉本爲我國特產之一，而且是馳譽海內外者；在從前僅茶葉一項，輸出國外年逮數千萬元之巨，因此這時的絲茶鹽木在我國是推爲四大商業的。但是我國產茶的區城很多，如：江，浙，豫，皖，川，粵，桂，陝，黔，贛，貴，閩等有十三四省，計四十多縣，然而各地所產的品名並不相同，其價値種類亦自各異，大概這也許因爲土質氣候的關係吧？</p>
<p>洞庭碧螺春，是出於太胡洞庭西山的深山野　間，古時傳說這茶業是由鳥卸種籽落于碧螺峯上，後便隨地萌芽，長爲野茶樹，當時一般年輕尼姑就將嫩芽摘下，用綢帕包裹，貼伏胸際兩乳間，以徐待其乾，乾後香綠司愛，故有是名，但此種傳說，前者尙有可信，叚後覺似無稽。</p>
<p>在前清乾隆帝遊幸江南時，駕至洞庭西山，有包山寺方丈佾某，便以此茶用山泉煮獻，乾隆嘗之，極加讀賞，於是錫以嘉名，而奉爲進貢珍品。其他如在巴拿馬賽會，南洋勸業會，等亦都獲得優等獎狀，民國十八年間，西湖博覽會中亦曾以重金覓購得此茶一罇，陳列於博物館中。於此，它的名貴更可想見了。</p>
<p>此茶的優點是淸潔而芬芳，醇厚而不刺激，其味甘凉而無苦澀，允其是喝過之後齒頰生凉，淸心沁脾，回味無窮。它有提神醒腦，生津益胃之功，而沒有與奮神經之弊。但可惜該處鄉民不知提倡種植，所以出品不多，且未加改良，薰製等仍用舊有土法，因此出品亦未見改進，我相信鄉民如果能够在薰製方面再加以研究，則其色香味當更爲佳妙呢。</p>
<p>現在新茶又已上市了，故近日的洞庭西山，在那濃綠原野又可見到一般村歸鄕姑們，纖手採摘，綠色湛然，幽香　袂，笑語風生的煊染得這深山窮谷頗不寂寞，而同時在每一個大小市鎭上也都應時地多了幾爿「小茶葉行。」</p>

<h3 id="c188">走私的結果如何 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 柳塘</p>
<p>北方走私的嚴重性，現已引起國際間之深刻注意，這是當然的結果。私貨多了，正當商貨（正當對私而言，即是完稅的商品，）的銷路，要受打擊，也是必然的事實。因走私猖獗的影響，使中國關稅有滅少三分之一的趨勢，對中國有債權關係的國家，愁本息無着，不免慌張了。再加以南北同時走私的結果，夾在中部的商業，受着絕大的威脅，「火燒眉毛，」亦有朝不保暮的惶恐。所以這幾天關於中國走私問題，引起了注意，——尤其是英美兩國。</p>
<p>羅斯先生爲此向北方奔跑了一趟，也幹不出甚麽辦法來。原想保全英國在北方的利益，「分我盃　；不料「喧賓奪主」之局勢已成，大有「臥榻之旁，不容他人鼾睡」的神氣。其實都是他們自取其咎，固然中國人自己不掙氣，不要怪人不帮忙；但是他們常拿中國做人情，「慷他人之慨，」今日就是「自食其報」的時候。在如此局面之下，還說「日本對華政策的諸多困難，吾人旣不輕視之，亦未嘗不予以體諒。一英國保守黨議員勒諾克斯仍在作」英國如承認「滿洲國」對日交涉是吾較爲便利」的發問，英人的心理，怎樣遷就日本人，幸而日本人不去理他，吾則處在夾板中的中國，遭遇不知到如何地步。如今所以皇皇不安，不爲別的，爲了。「中國關稅一月有十二萬鎊的損失，外債旣以關稅爲擔保品，深恐歐洲各國（允其是英國？）持券人之利益，感受嚴重影響」的緣故。這是保持他已得的利益。然而中國關稅如全部沒有收人，他們决不會因擔保品無着，而不索討；或竟爲維護他們的擔保品，出以特種行動，否則亦必向我索其他擔保，總之，他們那肯輕易受損失。所以我們如果希望國際間力量，來消滅走私的損失，其希望等於巴望國聯出來主持公義替中國收回失去的東三省，一般不可能，至多如李頓報吿書之類，予中國以文字上的慰藉而已。</p>
<p>至欲用外交方式，解决走私問題，正是「與虎謀皮。」你如向他抗議，他置之不理。他還可責備中國「管理疏忽。」甚至說「日本現在天津所取之步驟，乃欲保謢日人正當之商業利益，此項利益，因走私之結果，大受損害，」弦外之音，大有中國緝私不力（？），保護不周？之意；這不是千古奇談麽？「强化駐華軍隊，」並「增加軍隊人數，」還說這是「庚子和的規定（？）不侵犯中國的主權」呢？在這種蠻不講理之情勢下，海關緝私認眞去執行，必致發生衝突，他們父將以妨礙他們「正當之商業和益一爲口實，振振有辭，作爲進取的行動。如果我們有决心的話，那末緝私是我們的職權，即使有其他行動，我們只知爲名譽，求生存，犧牲亦有所不惜。</p>
<p>再看走私的結果是怎樣，就表面上觀察，大概所可見到的有下列幾項；暗中所蘊歲的計畫，我們還無從忖度。</p>
<p>（甲）關於中國財政方面：</p>
<p>破壞中國財政的收入，陷於困境。</p>
<p>破壞中國對外的信用，因關稅爲外債賠欵之擔保品。</p>
<p>破壞中國對內的信用，因內債亦以關稅爲擔保品。</p>
<p>破壞中國續募內外債之信用，俾收支缺額，無術彌補。</p>
<p>貶出保證準備之價値。</p>
<p>損害持券人之利益。</p>
<p>逼使外國債權人壓迫中國，而使中國不得不就其晚圍，並對外顯示其在華之勢力。</p>
<p>從破壞北方的關稅，或甚至破壞其他稅收，加緊壓迫中國財政之力量，而遂其分化之企圖。</p>
<p>（乙）關於中國海關方面：</p>
<p>可使中國被這而减低日貨之進口稅率。</p>
<p>或以華北一帶海關行政掌於日人之手，爲取締走私之條件。</p>
<p>甚或以日本貿易占中國進口貨之首位，迫令英國踐其宿諾，將海關最高行政地位，讓諸日人。</p>
<p>從各方面破壞海關行政之統一，使中國無法收拾。</p>
<p>或以的束及協定方式，施於此後之稅則方面，俾中國海關稅不能行其保護之實。</p>
<p>（丙）關於中國工商業方面：</p>
<p>走私貨以無稅之故，售價更廉，銷路　暢。</p>
<p>商界非賣日貨，將不能得利。</p>
<p>原有之工廠事業，盡爲日貨所擊破，無力再行經營，遂由日商出資收買，成其獨占中國工商業之企圖。</p>
<p>威脅利誘，使商人托庇於其旗幟之下，如昔日之掛洋商旗招然。而使中國法紀不伸，奸　橫行</p>
<p>因銀行存欵，民間資金，大部分投資於公債，將以本息愆期，資金呆擱之結果，而使整個經濟感覺不安。</p>
<p>工業永無建設復興之餘地、</p>
<p>商業永爲洋貨之販賣商。</p>
<p>農業永爲供給他人原料，處於殖民地之地位。</p>
<p>（丁）關於各國在華工商業方面：</p>
<p>各國商品不勝日貨傾銷之壓力，逐漸退出中國市場，而成日貨之獨占局面。</p>
<p>如各國商品不甘落後，亦惟有出於走私之一途，而使中國關稅吏受損失。</p>
<p>華南華北之私貨，南下北上，使英美商業中心之華中，亦有不能支持之勢，而終於拱手讓人。</p>
<p>在華工廠將與中國工廠同其運命。</p>
<p>以上云云，尙非事實，原不過就猜想所得，加以歸納，大多數人亦都能推想及此。惟我以爲走私的影響最應注意的，是在以走私爲顧全「中國國民生活的利益」的宣傳。我們何嘗不知道稅則之訂定，一方面注重財政收益，一方而要顧全國民經濟的利益，但是所謂國民經濟的利益，豈　注重在消費方面，當注重在建設方面。如注重消費，則中國素用洋貨，最好减輕洋貨進口稅，爲最得宜，然此固爲賣洋貨人所希望，而在買洋貨人，倒有所不願。但在一般無知的愚民，不問他是私貨，是國貨，祇求貨物價格便宜。貪一時之利，貽將來無窮之害，有所不計。飲配止渴，在旁人觀之，或許以爲可憐，而在本人，反甘之若飴。故麻醉手段，可使人不知不覺入其彀中，最爲可畏。日本人在中國，正是政治與經濟並進，威力與懷柔兼施。懷柔注重在人民，他要用直魯棉產，供他紡織之用，就在北平天津易縣等設立種棉指導區十三處，派遣專門人員，，實地栽培指導，各區棉田擴大至五千畝乃至一萬畝；並設立販賣組合，統制植棉試騐塲，一步一步地深入民間，旣得着了原料，又籠絡着民心，其嚴重比走私問題更値得注意。</p>
<p>嚴近關於緝私的辦法，孔部長日前談話中已有　示，即是「走私涉及外交方面者，當用外交方式解决。涉及犯罪方面者，當用法律嚴厲制裁。此外並運用稽核制度與統制辦法，以遏止走私猖獗之風。」此一項辦法，自能收緝私之效。不過天下興亡，匹夫有責」，假使中國無僞組織，走私無如是之易。無奸商，私貨即無從出銷；有私貨而不顧，奸商亦無能爲力。所以走私的猖獗，爲是貪便宜要買私貨之故。諺有「貪便宜即失便宜，」爲其所得者小，所失者大。故大家能從大處着想，具有决心，不待人之督　勸勉，一切自都有了辦法。</p>
<h3 id="c189">走私問題的檢討 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 吳小甫</p>
<p>一，走私概况</p>
<p>中國眞是一個特殊的國家，在其他各國所不見的事情，在中國可以見到；在人家所不會遭遇的事，也可常常遭遇到。中國的問題，確是一天一天的加多，身上的壓榨也一天一天的加甚；在千紛萬歧的問題和壓迫中，又來了這麽一個對於中國經濟具有致命傷之惡影饗的走私問題了。這是世界政治經濟日趨危急的局面下，帝國卞義拚命加緊進攻中國的表現。日貨的走私，在影響上，决非只限於中國數省，而是關連着中國整個經濟與財政，牽動到遠東乃至世界之全盤局勢的。在意義上，則此種走私更非只是少納了一筆關稅，而是有着種種方面須待解釋的。</p>
<p>這一走私問題，無論在形式上其發展是如何，其在本質上無疑義是日趣嚴重化的。</p>
<p>大規模的「武裝走私，」把中國弄得連殖民地都不如了（最少在形式上有些如此）！因爲殖民地關稅權最少在形式上是有其完整性Integrity的，沒有被這樣的走私所斵慟。因此，此種走私，無論其最後目的何在，亦無論其結局如何，其對中國關稅權所給予的破壞，對中國經濟與財政所加的影響，以及其所表現的特殊的暴厲的略取方式，是確定的了。</p>
<p>在具體事實上，關於走私之驚人消息，近日幾如雪片飛來。徐州四月二十三日中央社電吿，津浦路由津南下之走私，月達五萬噸。五月五日天津專電更聲稱，五月四，五兩日，走私砂糖人造絲總數述三千噸。本年前四個月，天津一帶之私貨，其種類及數額之業已査明老（旣係私貨，當然更不易査明其全部種類與數額）有如下述（註一）：</p>
<p>這是僅僅本年前四個月天津一帶所運入的私貨之已査明的一筆簡賬，然而穩類已不爲不多，而數量亦不爲不大了。由此種私貨所引起的「銷路塞塞」「價格暴跌」，的確直接的將　固市塲（此處僅指私貨　　之市場）破壞得一榻糊塗。誠如字林西報某通訉中所云（註二：）「或謂冀東私運如此猖獗，華北之正當貿易勢必大受其影響，此語實不足以形容眞狀于萬一，質言之，華北有數種重要易，已完全爲其所毀滅矣。」</p>
<p>豈但冀省天津一帶，山東亦受到巨大的影響呢。因爲私貨充斥的關係，山東土著人造絲已甚爲危殆，且廣柬，福建，上海等地，亦均受到私貨的摧殘了。（當然外貨私入中國，不只經由華北，其他各地例如廈門汕頭，亦大有私貨闖入之事，不過在目前，要以華北的門戶最爲洞開）。</p>
<p>二，走私給予中國的打繫</p>
<p>上述河北山東廣東福建上海各地受到私貨的停凌，這還楚僅僅舉例而言；實際上蒙受私貨之影響的决不止上述各地。如果私貨繼續湧進，則全中國市場必漸爲私貨所充斥，—若然，則中國諾大市場竟成爲私貨市場，世界通商史上亦可另闢奇異的一頁了。其對於中國農村與都市的影響，是異常巨大的。中國某種產品，例如糖類，其銷塲由價格會將一落萬丈。不用說將米，即在目前，廣東糖廠在走私影響下即有兩廠已宣布歇業了。因此我們知道私貨之中如人造絲與糖類，是最能够傷害中國農村的，因爲蠶絲與蔗糖尙是中國某幾省份的農村之主要副　，且私貨不僅使中國與私貨同類的產品受到蹂躪，其他營業亦會連帶蒙受其影響，例如華南與長江輪業，即已因私貨之故而更加衰落不堪了。（「然而日本船之航行上海到福州者，反在此不振時期中自三艘增加至六船，其原因所在，不難推索」（註三）。所以走私直接間接以兇猛的姿勢打擊蒲整個中國經濟；如果不為截止，則對於中國經濟前途無欵義是異常危險的。我們知道，中國經濟本來已在風雨飄搖中，危殆萬分了，如何經得起這一種超經濟的斵傷呵，在人家，國內經濟恐慌時便森嚴其關稅壁壘，並運用一切進攻與防守的方法，以求得經濟的昭蘇，和恐慌禍　的轉嫁。但在我國，則恰恰是一個反相。在經濟如此緊迫中，不用說別的，即低低的一道關稅土墻（决不是壁壘更談不到森嚴）亦已被走私推倒一大截了。這便是人爲刀俎，我爲魚肉的寫照。然而這又正是世界資本主義的流毒及其整個矛盾所迸發出來的現象呵。</p>
<p>最先最直接受到走私之影響的，自然是中國的財政。南京四月二十五日中央社電吿：「二十五年度國家總概算正由主計處會同各院部會編製中，……惟關稅因進口减少走私猖獗等原因，較二十四年度之數字已减。」這是明明吿訴我們中國財政已受到走私的影響。於這一段電吿中，我們還可看出去年十二月與今年一月之出超，主要原由之一即在於走私（註四）這一滑稽的秘訣（Secrecy）上，因爲「走私猖獗」，自然「進口减少」，（進口减少之另　重要原因，是中國允其是中國大衆購買力之絕對的减低）。中國財政，正同中國經濟一樣，在目前，實際上是日趨艱窘的，然而關稅方面不但不能於此時增加，反而於此時因走私之故而　形瘦弱，眞所謂「雪上加霜」「屋漏父遭連夜雨」了。</p>
<p>這樣，中國由此種走私受到至可驚駭的損一失，實在不復是一漏巵」二字所可形容了，只好說是一隻無底的杯了。</p>
<p>中國的工業仍處於幼稚時期，保護關稅是非常必要的，中國如果想要從中世紀的生產制完全轉變到近代的生產制，則保護關稅允具有槓桿作用。因爲保護關稅制度，是用以力迫縮短自中世紀生產制到近代生產制之過渡期的一種策略（註五）。這在先進各國之歷史上都可看到。英國關稅政策的爭執，往往長期的成了國會及政府之中心論題，關稅與一國經濟之重　關係可以槪見的。在今朝，「國家的壟斷資本主義」與集團經濟統治的時期，列强保護關稅更來得嚴密了。（當然，此種保謢關稅，與　業發展的初期和重商主義時代的保護關稅有些兩樣）。而且現在列强的社會經濟，實際上是愈形緊迫的，所以列强的關稅壁疊也就愈加高峻。獨在中國，關稅權從來即未完全自主過，現在更是破綻纍纍，而着巨大的難關了，這亦可窺見中國國力之衰落的程度。</p>
<p>三，走私之物徵</p>
<p>此種走私，與尋常的走私實質上沒有絲毫相同的地方。</p>
<p>走私（Smuggling）本來是一種經常現象，同時歷史上也有其著聞的前例。其爲經常的現象，平日的見聞　能够吿訴我們，在此處不必多加噜囌。其爲歷史上著聞的前例，則可舉出拿破崙時代英國向歐洲大陸之兇猛的走私看一看。當時拿破崙爲了與英國爭雄，創設大陸制（The　Contiental　System），封銷英國的商品，使之不得行　歐陸。但英貨終於由走私的逮徑，達到其固有的市場（註六）。不過英國之實施走私，係由於拿破崙之封銷英　。且當時英國之走私，主要是憑藉了經濟條件並且在法個以外下手實行的，而非依頗武　　明火　　的直接向法國私運。於今，中國並沒有封　旧貨（相反的，日貨在　，本極瀟）。而日貨竟然這樣的「武裝走私」，這確實是在走私領堅中）（在形式上）開闢了最新的記錄，形成亙古本有新奇事件。這可說算是一種特殊的走私。這也就是此種走私之特徵。</p>
<p>申而言之，此種走私既然公開的強迫以各種巨額商品毫無限制的（中國有限的消費力，）當然是一佃不可踰越的限制）運入中國（註七），而私貨之市場，又已成了自由貿易的市場。私運已成了自由貿易」（註八）則「走私」實已失其「私」之意義，與其說是走「私」，田寗說是走「公」了。（當然，由關稅這一單純的經濟範疇言之，無論走得如何公開，總應目爲走私）。這樣，中國不單沒有絲毫保護關稅的踪跡，且走私亦竟成爲自由貿易了！自由貿易如此產生，這種的自由貿易，道實在是經濟史乃至經濟學上一件創聞。無疑義的，這裹表示出帝國主義侵壓中國之嶄新的姿熊與特殊的方途，這裏反映出帝國主義者對中國的榨取已深刻到如何的程度，殘酷到如何的境地了。</p>
<p>一八四二年雅片戰爭後，英帝國主義强迫中國訂立江寗條的，後又根據江寗條約强迫締結關稅恊定，奪取了中國的海關樺，目的是在將中國化爲附庸，束縛其生產，使之永久沉淪於鐵蹄之下，只能提供布場與原料，不能享受眞正的獨立與自由。操縱中國關稅權，是壓榨中國的一個最重耍的武器，不僅僅直接的從稅費上榨取，更是間接的從經濟上略奪。不過，在形式上這尙是經過了條約的手續，並世在實質上這亦不是全部的略取。但現在的大規模「武裝走私」却是進一百步的壓榨了，——由部分的剝奪而進至合部的略取，——這是較操縱中國關稅權來得更加直接，更加暴厲，更加殘酷的。在實施走私者方面言之，這也可以說是一種肉搏，可以說是現在盛行的「刦略制度」之一個表現。此種現象，惟有在今日整個緊急開勢中才有之：受過來說，此種現象亦正反映出現在日本國內形勢以及整個形勢的危急。同時，形勢愈恐慌，則帝國主義對中國的摧殘更其加暴，這一點，於此種走私亦獲得個證明</p>
<p>四，走私一般之本質意義</p>
<p>由本質上觀之，走私一般是資本向國外進攻，向殖民地半殖民地略取的一種特殊手段。這一般是在某些特殊塲合下所採用的一種策略。此種策略（Artifice）之應用，目的在維持乃至擴大商品的向外輸出，藉以圖謀平均利潤的維持，乃至額外和潤的獲得。這是資本的本性所趨，其衝動力和炎威是非常强大的。（這也可以部分的說明上述拿破崙時代英國走私的勝利）。關於這點，德林氏（T.J.Duning）曾有一番甚爲透澈的解說，茲爲摘譯如下：</p>
<p>資本不規避利潤，或甚小的和潤，正如從前所說的自然（Naiure）憎惡眞空一樣。有着相當利潤時，資本是很勇敢的。百分之上的利潤，將保證資本在任何處所的運用；百分之二十的利潤，資本熱切起來；百分之五十，資本膽大妄爲；百分之百；資本乃準備蹂躪一切人類的法律，如爲百分之三百，則資本將不猶疑的去犯仟何罪惡，作任何的冒險，即使資本主人有被殺的危險也不去管了。……走私和奴隸貿易，充分的證明了這一些。（註九）</p>
<p>德林氏這些話，確將資本的面目描劃盡致。現在的　貨走私，某記者稱爲「在國際道德上實屬不合」，（註十）。這位記者大的是不大了解資本之本性的。「日本領事當局，曾公開宣言，謂私運入華，在日本法律之下並不違法。（註十一）領事當局此話，則又是爲了投合資本的本性，索性把走私解爲不違法了。、</p>
<p>五，走私與例强間的予循之加深</p>
<p>此種走私，是列强　　爭奪在華私益的場合下所產生的，亦即列强在華利益衝突益趨嚴重之結果。事實吿訴我們，日貨走私，因去年十一日三日中國貨幣政策宣布後而急形强化。因中國此種貨幣政策，使日貨輸華在外滙上所占的擾越條件蒙了一個不小的打擊，於是日貨走私乃飛速嚴重起來。此種走私之經濟目的，主要當然在維持乃至增加日貨的對華輸出，企圖　以與其他列强在華作有利的競爭。而因爲中國新幣制與英鎊發生了連系之　，日本更企圖藉走私（與私運銀元等等方策相輔而行）來帮助破壞中國新貨幣政策，打擊英國在中國之貨幣權上所占的優勢（自然，日本心目中在華的敵人不只是英國。）自然，走私問題嚴重後，羅斯便跑到華北去調查，去詢問，去計謀如何爭奪權利了。同時，倫教國會中，對中國走私問題亦大加注意（註十一），因爲此種走私不但影響到英帝國主義在華貿易與對華的債權，亦且牽涉到英國新近所得到的對中國貨幣樣所佔的優勢。此外，其他列强，目覩此種洪水般的走私情形，亦無不關心到自己在華的利益，而思有以加緊其爭奪戰。所以，從這一方面言之，此種走私又是會加甚列强在華的衝突的。推而言之，此種走私甚至會深化帝國主義在遠東，在太平洋，乃至在全世界範圍內的矛盾，而使之更陷於錯綜複雜到不可開交的地步！</p>

<p>老淋病之新療法</p>
<p>現代科學進步，各種醫學亦日新而月異，如一向視爲不易治愈之老淋病，現亦有特殊之新療法，因老淋病根源雖深，若施以抗淋血淸，電氣治療，及內服特效劑，則根除淋病，自非難事。尤須注意之一項，即已成婚之患者，夫婦必須同時治愈。以免彼此傳染之害。</p>

<p>欲補救是等天然之生理不足，必須服以最妥切之內分泌製劑，德國梅倫博士所發明之男用『補體康』女用『補女容』，即係採取猩猩獅虎海狗等勇壯動物，雌雄二性之內分泌，分別製成，功效卓著，最能增旺人體細胞，助長發育，轉弱爲强，且藥性王道，毫不敗胃並無任何刺激，曾有姜民基君，下體不發育，遺精早洩，失眠心悸，健忘頭昏，腎萎難舉，致夫婦時反目，遍治不效，經余示服『補體康』僅月餘而瘳，且生機回春，腎部雄偉，勞作有力，日臻壯健云。婦女因內分泌障碍失孕或多產，服『補女容』可得適量之生育，且有調經健體之偉效，叉能旺盛細胞，而使乳房發育，若常服至一二月，並獲肌膚粉嫩，永保靑春。</p>

<h3 id="c205">阿王表示滿意 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 閑</p>
<p>近據報載國外電訉，有着阿王對於國聯會行動，表示滿意的標題，我滿腹搜索不出到了今日，阿王對於國聯，竟尙有滿意的地方—後把新聞仔細一讀，方知對於國聯行政院，拒絕承認意國駐日內瓦總代表阿洛錫，能在行政院會議中代表阿比西尼亞之行爲一事，阿王表示滿意，其實國聯對於意阿戰爭，早經議决意國為侵略國，幷議决制裁辦法，與宣布實行，今若承認意國駐日內瓦代表，有代表阿比西尼亞之權，卽使國聯不為阿國着想，而國聯對於自己本身，亦未免不好意思。</p>
<p>阿國從意國開始侵略以來，一向請求國聯，信任國聯，惟國聯的命令是從，於國聯議决意國爲侵略國，阿王表示滿意，其後又議决將意國制裁，阿王更是滿意，現在阿王已經出走，意兵入駐阿京，幷且意國已上意王兼阿比西尼亞皇帝的尊號，意國公表阿國土地，盡爲意國所有，而阿王對於國聯的行動，還在滿意，其眞滿意乎？其不滿意乎？</p>
<p>其實阿王對於國聯會之行動，何嘗有一些滿意者？惟明知國聯除幾條議决案，使人稍有相當滿意之外，更無其他舉動足使人滿意者在也，假使國聯幷幾條議决案而無之，幷拒絕意國代表代表阿國之權而無之，則國聯更不成爲國聯矣，我姑將國聯的本身，一檢討之，國聯的組織，原以英法日德意五國爲中心，現在德日兩國，早已退出國聯，意國自身，又爲侵略國，則國聯的中堅份子所僅存者，不過英法兩國而已，而兩國之中，又是同床各夢，所以日本侵略我國，而國聯無可如何，意國侵略阿國，而國聯亦無可如何，德國雖非侵略他人之國，但突然廢棄梵爾賽條的，駐兵萊茵河畔，幷且駸駸乎有併吞奧國之勢，而國聯更無可如何，蓋國聯的本身，大多數已是侵略國，故欲乞援國聯，而能使弱小民族滿意，原是夢想。</p>
<p>或者謂强國的本身，必先顧到自己的利益，假定五强國中，利害有衝突時，則弱小國可須臾無死，或可得相當之滿意，此說亦不盡然，意阿之役，英意間的利害衝突，不可謂不甚，非但英意在阿國的利益，有絕大的衝突，而他日地中海蘇彝士運河的覇權，亦不免有衝突之勢，故此次阿國的失敗，，亦是國聯的失敗，非但國聯的失敗，實是英國的失敗。</p>
<p>前日意國駐日內瓦總代表阿洛錫，不滿意於國聯行政院之態度，率領意國全體代表，起程出境，此决阿洛錫離日內瓦而返國，雖未聲明退出國聯，而其退出國聯之成分居多可不言而知也，故此後國聯行將如何，而問題之演變有不可思擬者矣。</p>
<h3 id="c206">「復活」觀後 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 李一</p>
<p>中國旅行劇團在卡爾登演出</p>
<p>因爲觀點不同，各種人對某件事含有不同的看法；例如托爾期泰的「復活」，便如此。</p>
<p>「復活」迄個故事是非常動人的，搬上銀幕的，便有三次之多；而在最近中國劇壇上，把那部世界名作改爲舞台劇的，也有三種之多。</p>
<p>一種，是從前電通劇團打算演的，由唐納改編；一種，是南京中國舞台恊會演出的，由田漢改編；又一種，則是這决中旅演出的一種，據說原劇是由一位法國作家改編的，經陳綿譯成了中文</p>
<p>前二種現在不談；這兒所談的，便是我在看了「中旅」的「復活」之後的觀感。</p>
<p>「復活」中最得觀衆同情的，應該是格蒂沙，她被「王爺」遺棄，她又被「王爺」的姑母驅逐，她和窮困奮鬥過，然而終於鬥不過負困而墮落，甚至，她並沒有犯什麽罪，然而他得了徒刑二十年，充軍到西比利亞去的待遇；至於那位王爺尼克呂多夫他祇是一個良心尙未泯沒的入物，他的救格蒂沙，那祇是爲了解除他良心上的痛苦，完全是爲了自贖罪愆的行爲。</p>
<p>然而中旅的「復活」却是怎樣呢？他對格蒂沙的同情是遠不似尼克名多夫的，六幕戲中差不多，都集中在尼克呂多夫身上，他把尼克呂多夫寫成了救格蒂沙的「靈魂」的「神」，他把尼克呂多夫的行爲寫成了不是「自贖」，而是救格蒂沙，最後，並且是把托爾斯泰說成爲戀愛至上主義者了。</p>
<p>對這樣的曲解我們是不能不指出的。</p>
<p>本來，爲了接受文學遺產，把從前的名作給它注射了新生命，原是無可誹議的，然而在這裏，我們却祇看到了曲解。</p>
<p>爲了着重於尼克呂多夫，爲了把尼克呂多夫案成了救人靈魂的「神」，所以這裏有不必要的第二幕和第四幕。</p>
<p>就以每幕單獨分開來說罷，第三幕格蒂沙的性格也寫得太閃爍的；第五幕，由革命黨人的受虐待，憤怒，而轉到大談戀愛　上，前後的情緒，也顯得太不和諧。</p>
<p>至於在演出上，則中旅的努力是値得入佩服的，允其是照明和置景，這豈但所謂「技術上的樣品」，的確是做到了很難能的地步。不過在第三幕，右邊的燈似乎太亮，（加上盞昏暗的頂燈，右邊的燈火可不要。）使牢獄的那種幽暗，汚穢的情景失去了眞實。</p>
<p>演員方面，唐若哥演得很賣力，戴涯則在個性上似欠把握，在化裝上，序幕和第一幕的年代相隔了十年，而化裝方面却依舊沒有顯得老，這一點是應該注意的。</p>
<p>「復活」是中旅這决在上海演出的最後一個戲；在唐槐秋君的「我們的立塲和希望」中，他告訴我們過去僅是給我們看技術的樣品」，此後，他們將進展至第二期工作，演一些「不離開時代，不離開大衆」的有重大意義的戲了，我們希望他除了排演有意義的新劇本之外，對於現在演過的戲，也希望他能够加以修正，使「不離開時代，不離開大衆」；譬如「復活」，便該找一個另外「適時代，為大衆」的劇本來演。</p>

<p>— 應彪</p>
<p>『吿訴你們』，王局長威嚴地說。兩雙眼睛瞪得溜圓。『縣長今天說過，這歌子無論怎樣要唱會，這是主席頂喜歡的歌子。懂嗎』？</p>
<p>『是』台下百十個聲音一齊喊。</p>
<p>『現在開始重唱，一，二』。</p>
<p>『鷄將鳴——時天破曉』……</p>
<p>『不成！小成！「鳴」要唱得高！怎麽越來越糟，趙得標！把後邊站着那一排帶下去，每人來十棍！看你們用心不用心』！他脹紅着臉，握着半截已斷的打棍，述連地敲着棹子。</p>
<p>『是』趙得標來了個立正，就跑過去對着站在最後一排的警察，揮了下手。他們便馴羊似的跟他走出去。在門外過道上，每人打了十棍，又帶着回來。</p>
<p>『報吿局長，每人十棍』。趙得標敬着禮報吿。</p>
<p>『就是這樣，誰再他媽的不用心，還是十棍，唱！，二』。話沒說完，勤務小李闖進來。</p>
<p>『報吿局長，縣長有電話來，請局長說話』一個敬禮。</p>
<p>『站着別動，回來再說』。</p>
<p>『是』一片聲音答應。脚下都隨着來了個立正。王局長帶着氣走出去。屋裏賸下這羣失掉自由的囚徒們。他們看着局長的背影剛轉過門去，談話便開始了。然而那總是低聲的，偷偷的。只有一個略高的聲音罵了一句：</p>
<p>『老子混了二十多年軍隊，還沒經着這麽一回』！</p>
<p>『這就呌你嘗一嘗』！一個聲音在回答。</p>
<p>『吃，吃！』一陣低聲的喧笑。</p>
<p>『局長到縣政府去了，呌暫時解散』一個巡官進來說。</p>
<p>『小子！免不了吃槍子！』從擁出的人羣裏，迥蕩着這樣一句話。這時王局長騎了脚踏車剛走局門外。兩個勤務掛着盒子槍隨在後邊。像一陣風，三個人飛到縣政府。勤務停在院內，王局長一個人走進辦公室。縣長正跟幾個科長在談話，彷彿沒有覺察有人進來。他走過去行了舉手禮，縣長溜了一眼，把胖胖的身子欠了欠，示意要他坐下。他不安地坐在縣長身後椅子上，一面默默地聽着。</p>
<p>『雖說主席不在乎，可是你知道，那是我們縣裏的臉面。無論怎樣，你要辦一下。還有劉科長』，縣長調回頭對左邊坐的一個瘦子說。『明天到底有多少學校參加？太少了難看。你想縣裏每年支出這多敎育經費，太不像樣還成！怎麽？十五個學校？兩千左右學生？就這樣罷。可是，你吿訴他們，制服都要穿，沒制服的不准到隊。不過，唉』！縣長急急地說，因爲說得太快，似乎聽着有些口吃。他一面說着，從腰裏摸出手巾，擦了一下光頭，順手呷了口茶又接着說：</p>
<p>『那一個學校最整齊，就呌他站在前排』。說完，他伸展了下腰，猛然發覺王局長坐在身後。</p>
<p>『我竟把你忘了，太忙，你的事怎麽樣』？縣長脹紅得像東瓜般的胖臉上，推下一絲笑意，似乎表示抱歉。</p>
<p>『一切都遵着縣長指示的辦好了，祇有歌子，那「朝會歌」，他們怎麽也唱不會』。</p>
<p>『那還成』？縣長急得幾乎跳起來。』我說，王局長，我不是已吿訴你，主席最喜歡這個歌子，現在！你』，他忙亂地抓着頭皮，臉上的笑意，早不知躲向那去</p>
<p>『我用心敎了半下午，那些傢伙簡直笨透了』！王局長不安地站起來，看着縣長，心裏不知怎樣才好。</p>
<p>『本來也不能專怪你，太慌促了！今天早晨才接到省裏電話。你太忙，別人又不會，不能代你敎。好，你回去罷，無論怎樣要敎他們唱會了』。</p>
<p>『是』，王局長轉身出去。到院裏抓過車子便跳上去。又一陣風跑向公安局。路上他什麽都沒注意，連進門時門崗的敬禮都忘了回。</p>
<p>『吹警笛！集合，到禮堂』！他下了車子就喊。警笛響了，一個個黑影子都捲進了禮堂。他剛要也隨了進去，突然辦公室電話鈴響起來。他跑進去抓起耳機，</p>
<p>『哦！我是王子瑞，怎麽？主席不來了？有外國武官參觀。是是』。放下耳機，輕鬆地吐了口氣。</p>
<p>『吿訴他們，歌子不學了』。轉身對門前的勤務兵說。</p>
<h3 id="c208">井 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 東光</p>
<p>打麥塲旁邊的那口井用石板蓋着，轆轤架的樣子也拆去了。多少年代來附近的居民們都吃那里面的水，如今呢？井口封得緊緊的，一堵三尺高的土牆砌在堅厚的石板上，在牆的中心，挖了一尺見方的小小神龕，一尊半尺高的井龍王塑在那里面，坐着，日子依然向前爬動，多少莊稼漢每待到三里外河　上去担水的時候，經過那座井口便照例的罵起那句話來：</p>
<p>「臭娘們下輩也得托生個畜類，禍害我們。」</p>
<p>被駡的是個年靑女孩子，她死去一年了。一年前，那個蒸人的五月天，麥子黃稜稜的垂着大穗頭，在原野中，讓薰風吹搖着可愛的身幹，漸漸地熟了。這打麥塲的主人，唐老先生家，也正一車車的從村南的高地；從河灘北岸的套地里，向這平整的塲上蓮着發光的麥捆，車子沉重的碾過村道，麥粒漲破了肚皮般的零散着，飄落到車轍里，等車一進塲，許多長工站到車廂上，大捆大捆的向塲的邊沿處拋。老年的東家托着水烟袋坐在樹蔭下看着，嘴吹得筒里面的水卜魯魯的發嚮，他暢快的笑着，看那些忠實的漢子們，使大白木杈把麥頭堆得像小山似的，一連好多座。映着毒熱的太陽，閃灼灼的，像一些金屬似的放着光。長工們在這時刻也是分外高興的，整年的忙碌中，主人總給他們吃陳年霉味的穀米，虫　了的玉米麵和蛆啃了洞的鹹蘿卜，惟有麥忙中，他們能盡量的吃新打下來的麥飯或麥餅。</p>
<p>一天黃昏中，長工們都回去吃晚飯了，麥塲上只有唐家的一個孫子在守塲。晚風中，蚊子在井邊水窪處嚶嚶的嗚着，灰黑色的蝙蝠在閃閃的星空下追捕飛虫吃，一切都是平靜的，較遠處有孩子們唱着兒歌：</p>
<p>夜蝙蝠，抽烟來，抽了我的烟，不給我錢，對着你家門口駡三年……</p>
<p>他把凉蓆展在空曠的麥塲上，靜靜的臥着，用芭蕉扇揮着飛來的蚊虫，和皮膚上沁出的汗珠，突的，在那一堵短牆似的麥捆後面，沙沙的嚮起來。他悄悄的弓着身走去，在麥堆的極東邊，正有一個人影在扯麥捆，他猫一般輕蹺着脚步撲過去，待那偷麥的女孩子發覺有人捉她來了，已經讓那「荷荷」的冷笑着的年靑人抓住了胳膊，這女孩子驚嚇的鬆了麥捆，在夜的暗影中，她兩眼發着乞憐的淚光瞅着他，漸漸的她輭弱的跪了下去，乞求的說：</p>
<p>「放了我吧，我再也不敢來了。」</p>
<p>這年靑男人抓得很緊，仙精神也有些激奮，他仔細的看着這個女孩子的裝束，她說話的聲音，都覺得不似個本地人，便向道：</p>
<p>「你是誰家的？」</p>
<p>「我是……是拾麥船上的。」她聲音有些顫抖的說：「我們那兒，我的家，都給大水冲光了。先生，你放了我吧，我下一次絕不偷，……偷來。」</p>
<p>女孩子哭着，顯得不可抑止的那麽悲傷，這年靑人眉頭縐着，突的他放鬆了手說：</p>
<p>「你去吧。」</p>
<p>女孩子皮轉過身去，怱忽地走着，頭也不敢抬的抹着淚忽然。</p>
<p>「嘿，你回來，你帶回兩個麥……」</p>
<p>他沒說完，那女孩子害怕的急向北一扭身，她恐怕那人又反來抓回她去，慌張的，沒留心前面是什麽，一脚踏了空，便掉進那張開大嘴的井口里了。她尖厲的呼喊了聲，麥塲上的靑年聽得井水「通」的發了聲巨嚮，他驚慌的跑到井口看着，那可憐的孩子在里面黑洞洞的跟水掙扎着他不知怎麼辦好，自己不能撈去，他又怕旁入知道是自己嚇下她去的，他焦燥着，一歇，井里的呼聲慢慢給水吞沒了。他瘋了般痛苦着跑回家去。</p>
<p>第二天黎明，一個打水人發現了女屍，從此那口井便被井主人封閉了．說是有人破他家陽宅的「風水」，六十年後才能重打開這口井。</p>

<p>麗雅　（笑說）對了，就是那隻、My　DarlingI　Love　You唷！</p>
<p>他吹了一會兒，我也不理他，後來他居然唱起來了，</p>
<p>驚鴻　他唱的也是那隻My　Darling　I　LoveYou嗎？</p>
<p>麗雅　不是的，他唱的是敎我如何能忘你，我還記得他末兩句是那麼唱的（唱敎我如何能忘你末兩句，請參照陳歌辛先生作曲之「西施」歌唱集）</p>
<p>（唱畢驚鴻與麗雅相對大笑，在笑聲裏說）</p>
<p>麗雅　（笑說）我看這個人簡直有點「神經病」！</p>
<p>驚鴻　我看他是個「色情在」吧？</p>
<p>麗雅　這種人，殺了我的頭，我都不會去愛他的，你看他那種扭揑的態度，低聲做氣的聲音，一點兒也表現不出壯年男子的美態來，他仍舊是十八世紀賈寳玉式的病態男子，我看見他，我就一肚子氣！尤其是；他是個蘇州人，我最討厭的就是毫無剛强氣的蘇州人！</p>
<p>驚鴻　也許他這個蘇州人是特別的呢？</p>
<p>麗雅　那我敢斷定；他不是特別的蘇州人，就從他喜歡看女人這點兒毛病上說起米，他的確不是個特別的蘇州人，而且還是頂沒有用的蘇州人呢！</p>
<p>驚鴻　你何以見得他是頂沒有用的蘇州人呢？</p>
<p>麗雅　沒有用的蘇州人，大半都喜歡用不正當的眼光偷看女人，也會用不正當的手段跟女人們交際，更會用卑劣的方法來玩弄女性，</p>

<h3 id="e1">Increasing Legal Tender Protection: Finance Minister H.H. Kung Issues Declaration; Reviews Domestic and International Financial Situation; Stipulates Three Implementation Measures; Also Talks about Minting Silver Coins <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai News: Finance Minister H.H. Kung issued a declaration last night and gave a statement to a Central News Agency reporter. A summary is as follows:</p>
<p>Declaration: Since the promulgation of the legal tender policy on November 3rd of last year, the government has actively implemented it. For half a year, foreign exchange has stabilized, and the national economy and people's lives have become more comfortable. Based on past experience and a review of the domestic and international financial situation, the following implementation measures have been stipulated to ensure financial security and increase legal tender protection: In order to fully maintain the credibility of legal tender, the government's cash reserves should account for at least 25% of the total amount issued. To facilitate business and the people, the government will immediately mint half-dollar and one-dollar silver coins to complete the types of coinage. To enhance the stability of legal tender, the government has already raised substantial funds to increase gold and foreign exchange reserves sufficiently.</p>
<p>Based on the above regulations, China's monetary system will maintain its independent status and will not be constrained by any changes in other countries' monetary systems. With the stable status of legal tender, the national economy will certainly prosper. This is deeply believed.</p>
<p>Statement: Finance Minister Kung gave the following statement to a Central News Agency reporter last night: Recently, there have been many rumors in the market, widely spreading that the government will remint one-dollar silver coins, with the size and fineness equal to only one-third of the original silver dollar. It is said that this reminting is equivalent to devaluation, confusing the public and benefiting speculation. In fact, since China implemented legal tender, its value has long been decoupled from the price of silver and is based on gold and foreign exchange. Coins are auxiliary to legal tender, and their quality, what kind of metal, as well as the style, size, weight, are all irrelevant. For example, gold standard countries mostly cast coins from silver, nickel, or copper, and their value is based on the statutory price, not on the market price of the silver, copper, or nickel they contain. Furthermore, the type of soft currency is mainly determined by the face value. A one-yuan, five-yuan, or ten-yuan banknote is just a piece of paper, but their values are vastly different. Similarly, a draft from a bank or merchant with a face value of 500 yuan is worth 500 yuan, and a draft with a face value of 5,000 yuan is worth 5,000 yuan. The difference in value is not determined by the quality of the paper on which the draft is written. This example is very clear. By extension, the same applies to silver coins. This kind of common sense should be understood by everyone and does not require deep debate. Those who are misled by rumors only expose their lack of knowledge. As for the government's efforts to consolidate credit, there are full guarantees and preparations in law and in fact. The detailed items have already been stated in today's declaration.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Problems of Post-Bandit Suppression in Shanxi Province <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Rui</p>
<p>Since February 17, remnants of the bandits of Mao Zedong and Xu Haidong groups suddenly stormed the Sanjiao Town in western Shanxi, and gradually crossed the river to intrude into Sh樓, Zhongyang, Lishi, Xi County, Xiaoyi, Fenyang and other places. The military of bandit suppression in Shanxi Province suddenly became tense, and the Central Committee also sent a large army into Shanxi to assist in the suppression. More than 100,000 troops were mobilized and fought for more than three months. After encirclement and suppression, the bandits were scattered in early this month. Most of them crossed the river and fled back to northern Shaanxi. Less than two or three thousand bandit remnants remained in Shanxi, which are being encircled and suppressed by the Shanxi army and can be completely eliminated. The Shanxi-Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters convened a security meeting on the 14th, and resolved that the whole province except for the counties in western Shanxi would be lifted martial law starting on the 16th. The military bandit suppression in Shanxi Province has come to an end. The urgent thing now is to deal with the aftermath.</p>
<p>The counties that were invaded by the Communist bandits in this decision reached more than thirty. The local losses were extremely heavy. Shanxi Province was originally a relatively wealthy province, but in recent years it has also been affected by the economic recession. The national economy collapsed and the rural areas went bankrupt. Only a very few families with inheritances can barely support themselves. This time, the Communist bandits plundered and looted everything in their path, turning even the surviving wealthy households into paupers. If we do not actively seek relief, compensation, and reconstruction policies for the rural areas after the disaster, then the so-called good people may also take risks and become a major local problem. The most important tasks for post-war recovery are of course to clear the villages, pacify the people, and provide relief. Yan Xishan has ordered the affected counties to quickly appease the people, rush to deal with the aftermath, eliminate the remnants of the bandits, and step up political work to stabilize people's livelihoods. At the same time, the two Suiyuan Provincial Headquarters sent military and political officials to comfort the counties that were invaded by the bandits, and they have set off separately on the 14th. We hope that the Shanxi Provincial authorities will not only stop at official routines, but will be able to very effectively investigate and provide relief, so that the refugees can return home as soon as possible and the rural areas can gradually recover. We also hope that the Central Government can specially allocate a large sum of money for the expenses of the post-war recovery work in Shanxi Province.</p>
<p>When the Communist bandits rampaged in northern Shaanxi in July of last year, Yan Xishan advocated thoroughly preventing them by political means. He convened a conference on preventing communism and resolved more than 30 items. The most important work was to make land village-owned as the fundamental method of preventing communism, and to organize farmers' self-defense groups and reduce unemployment as effective methods of preventing communism. Unfortunately, the resolution was just completed and had not yet been implemented when the Communist bandits had already crossed the river and invaded. Now that the bandits have been eliminated, it is the time to implement the resolution on preventing communism. We hope that a well-thought-out implementation method for land village-ownership will be studied and implemented. First, a model area will be established, and then it will be gradually promoted. The decision on how to arm all 1.2 million farmers in the province to enhance their self-defense capabilities, organization and training is a prerequisite. After the self-defense force is formed, on the one hand, it can resist the Communist bandits' armed looting, and on the other hand, it can also guarantee the safety of Shanxi Province. It is indeed an urgent task.</p>
<p>Under the situation of a strong neighbor advocating joint anti-communism, on the one hand, the voice of economic development of North China is chanted, coveting the richness of Shanxi Province's 130,000 trillion tons of coal reserves. Therefore, Shanxi Province is actually in a dangerous environment. The Shanxi Provincial authorities need to make more efforts to solve the people's livelihood economy to seek thorough prevention of communism, and to seek the survival of the nation through political clarity, people's self-defense. Because Shanxi Province is fraught with crises, what we expect from the Shanxi Provincial authorities has to be more urgent.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Closing of the Administrative Personnel Conference: President Chiang's Admonitory Address (Continued) <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Fifth Section: Prudence and Groundedness. Everyone knows that China is an extremely poor country. It is impossible to wait until enough funds have been raised to then proceed with undertakings. Therefore, everyone must be as thrifty and frugal as possible, so that one dollar's worth of funds can achieve the effect of two or three dollars, and even undertake projects that do not cost money. It is acknowledged that the government has made every effort to improve the financial system since last year, and the national economy is showing signs of recovery. This is the initial effect of promoting the legal tender policy. However, the foundation is not yet solid. The credibility of the legal tender must gradually increase both domestically and internationally for the national economy and all undertakings to have a chance of survival. Therefore, in the next year or two, regardless of the central or local governments, every effort must be made to consolidate the credibility of the legal tender. All provinces must understand this intention and ensure that the budget revenues and expenditures are balanced. Even if projects are increased, they must exert every effort to be prudent and control the distribution of funds, so as not to increase the budget. It must be known that before the national economic construction is completed, the only way to open up a future path is through extreme frugality. For example, the recent economic prosperity of Soviet Russia, where all projects have huge amounts of funding, actually came from the extreme frugality and hard work of the government and people of that country several years ago, who reduced clothing and food, and devoted their sweat and labor to production. Our situation at this time also requires extreme frugality. Local areas must devote themselves to the rational allocation of funds in the future, and must not be without plans or waste even a little. Therefore, first, it is necessary to determine the fundamental priorities, starting with the most basic and urgent matters. Second, it is necessary to make good use of human resources to compensate for economic poverty. Third, it is necessary to be pragmatic in everything and seek a balance between quantity and quality. For example, in education, in countries with an existing foundation, it is certainly possible to expand as much as possible. However, in a poor and weak country like ours with a lack of foundation, we can only first seek to improve quality, and then seek to expand quantity. Moreover, in terms of undertakings, if the quality is good, that means the foundation is solid. Even if the quantity is small, it can have a large effect. If we only seek a large quantity but not good quality, then even a large quantity is useless, and even harmful. This is not only the case in education. For the Baojia system, in the past, we focused on promotion, but in the future, we should also pay special attention to qualitative improvement. In short, China is a poor country, and poverty requires poor people's solutions. We must always work hard with both our minds and our bodies, using spirit to compensate for the lack of material resources, so that undertakings can proceed effectively.</p>
<p>Sixth Section: Management and Control. Currently, our local politics, in addition to education, cultivation, and health, must pay special attention to management. In other words, we should focus on discipline and order. Therefore, in addition to the three key items of "education," "cultivation," and "health," we must add "management." Only with "management," "education," "cultivation," and "health" are we complete. If we only know education, cultivation, and health, but do not know management, then the foundation of all education and health work will not be solid, and the implementation will not be consistent. As a result, all work will not be sustainable. Moreover, if modern politics is to be effective, it cannot allow for dispersion and divergence, whether for people or matters. If discipline is not strict and order is not maintained, it will be impossible for education, cultivation, and health to have a practical effect and meet the requirements of the modern era. "Management," in simple terms, means enforcing laws and regulations, and bringing the people's behavior within the proper bounds. Only with complete laws and regulations and organized management can local affairs begin to be properly managed. The above is an explanation of the necessity of management in terms of personnel. In addition to personnel, we must also manage production, manage land, manage transportation, especially food and labor. We must first pay attention to the word "management," which is the only important task for administrative personnel today. The method of management should start with investigation and statistics. We must accurately know the exact number and actual situation of land, households, labor, products, and enterprises in the area, and then comprehensively organize and utilize them. Only then can we truly achieve the point of "everyone using their talents, every piece of land being used to its full potential, every object being used to its full potential, and goods flowing smoothly." The way of governing can be said to be nothing more than this. The ultimate goal is "control." Control does not mean taking over jurisdiction or taking charge of everything. Rather, it means that all public and private materials within the area must be under the overall supervision of the responsible personnel, regardless of whether they are government-run or privately run. Predict their certain functions and interrelationships, and then consider the gains and losses, make good adjustments, properly allocate them, and comprehensively plan to assist their development and maximize their effectiveness. I dare say that if today's administrative personnel do not know the principles of control and do not have the means of control for people, land, objects, and matters, then this kind of politics can never become modern politics, and these administrative personnel cannot become modern administrative personnel. The key to the success or failure of politics and the rise or fall of the nation lies entirely in this. In fact, this kind of method already had this scale and system when our country's ancient political organization was complete. The so-called "governing the people with the people, using the people for the people" is precisely this meaning, and the completion of the ultimate goal of "government of the people, by the people, for the people" must also take this as a path.</p>
<p>The above is an instruction on the main work guidelines for local administrative personnel, and can also be said to be the path and method of effort in the future. In addition, after listening to the reports from administrative personnel in various regions, I feel that there are many key points that need to be improved and paid attention to in various regions in the future. Now I will list the main points as follows:</p>
<p>The central work items stipulated by the provinces are inevitably too numerous, and as a result, lower-level personnel cannot handle everything well, and can only embellish each item to cope with the orders of superiors. In the future, it is advisable to consider the special circumstances of each province and each region, reduce the number of central work items, select the one or two most important items, stipulate them, concentrate efforts, complete them within a time limit, and strive to achieve a real effect. The selection of these central work items can use the following three standards: (A) Those that have been carried out with a considerable foundation in this province and region and are in urgent need of completion; (B) Those that are most lacking and needed by the province; (C) Those that are particularly urgently needed in terms of regional environment. For example, in the northwestern provinces, it is advisable to promote afforestation; in the provinces of Henan and Jiangsu, it is advisable to focus on river dredging and water management; in the old bandit areas, it is advisable to focus on land and production; in the coastal and river provinces, it is advisable to pay special attention to public education and the training of national consciousness. In short, it is necessary to adapt to local conditions, and whether it is directly or indirectly related, it is necessary to precisely select and implement those that are most related to national defense.</p>
<p>Local administrative personnel must understand the principle of "knowing how to give is to take." Guanzi said, "Those who know how to give are taking, and they can obtain the way to govern." We are now suffering from economic exhaustion and difficulty in raising funds, and we should encourage production, promote cooperation, and benefit the people, so that after the people's strength and wealth have been cultivated sufficiently, all undertakings will have a solid foundation. It is even more impossible to start new policies purely for the sake of tax collection. All provinces, regions, and counties must implement national economic construction in accordance with this principle.</p>
<p>Today, the most important tasks are, first, savings, and second, production. The so-called savings not only encourages the saving of money, but should also make the local people aware that saving goods is better than saving money, and that saving goods is even more important than saving money. The trend of saving should be actively promoted and methods should be developed. As for the accumulation of goods, it is not only limited to grain. Even a needle and thread should be used sparingly and stored as much as possible, and even waste copper and scrap iron should not be discarded at will, but should be stored to help alleviate the poverty of the country. As for encouraging production, each county should conduct a thorough investigation of the local original production and industry, and reward or subsidize them locally. It should be known that a small amount of production is better than no production, and even if the quality is not very good, it is better than no production in the end.</p>
<p>The best way for us to organize and train the people is to start from the economic aspect, inducing the people's own interests and making them enthusiastically follow. For example, in running the Baojia system, it is best to incorporate economic meaning into it. At the same time, promote various cooperatives. It is said that Changle County in Fujian Province raised 20,000 yuan to purchase vegetable cake fertilizer and lend it to the people. After the due date, the people not only returned the full amount, but also automatically obeyed the county government's orders in the future, increasing the government's faith, which was no small matter. The Baojia work was thus able to proceed effectively. This is the best example, and can be followed in various regions.</p>
<p>After the local security teams were centrally commanded and dispatched by the provincial government, the teams in this area could not stay in this area, and local defense was often affected. In the future, regarding the security teams, their funding and training should still be concentrated in the province, but at the same time, the teams in this area should still be returned to this area, and the district commander or commissioner should be given the power to dispatch and allocate them.</p>
<p>To achieve thorough results in running the Baojia system, it is necessary to adopt the spirit of the joint responsibility system, further strictly stipulate and implement the system of joint liability. The selection of Baojia chiefs should be carefully selected. After the appointment, they must be tested at any time, promoted or demoted, and attention must be paid to training so that they can gradually improve. When training Baojia chiefs, they should be taught the essentials contained in the book "New Knowledge of Self-Defense" and the selected quotations of Qi Jiguang compiled by Yu.</p>
<p>Now the central government has designated areas to implement the Conscription Law. The provincial department heads, commissioners, and county heads must assist as much as possible in the implementation of conscription and conscription in accordance with the principles and methods stipulated by the central government, regarding it as their own business, and must not regard it as the central government's business, shirking responsibility to the garrison area or regimental area and neglecting it. They must cooperate to supervise and handle it, regarding it as the most important basic work in the province and region.</p>
<p>Although the scattered bandits in various places have been gradually suppressed, there must still be no slightest negligence. They must be thoroughly eliminated and eradicated, so that there is not a single bandit left in this area. It must be known that if a bandit is left, it can gradually spread and become a major disaster like a prairie fire in the future. The bandit disaster in Jiangxi can be taken as a warning.</p>
<p>Suppressing bandit disasters depends on the strength of society and politics, and should not rely solely on military force. The degree of suppression is completely different. The method of suppression can apply the principle of seven parts politics and three parts military, while the time of suppression can only use one part military, and must rely on the power of nine parts politics. It is hoped that various methods will be thoroughly researched. All Baojia reconnaissance, transportation training, must be in accordance with the actual situation, research various methods, and pay special attention to the various items mentioned in the book "New Knowledge of Self-Defense," especially the chapter on "Preparation," to enrich the strength of self-defense, and the equipment for preventing bandits and resisting bandits. In short, it must be in places with very few people and extremely unfavorable transportation, where a small amount of military force should be applied. In other areas, attention should be paid to work outside the military to assist the military in completing the suppression of bandits.</p>
<p>Regarding the subjects of training the strong, the military is secondary. First, they should be taught the common sense that modern citizens should have, so that they can understand the general situation of the modern world, the country's position, and the responsibilities of citizens. Second, they should be trained in public morality, so that they know the importance of respecting public order, maintaining public interests, and complying with public health, and inspire their spirit of labor service, mutual assistance and cooperation, and sacrifice for the public. In the future, the central government should also compile and distribute a textbook of common sense for civic training as a basis for training in various places.</p>
<p>Whether running Baojia or training the strong and the people, it is necessary to start with training cadres first. If the cadres are sound, they can generate the power of one person teaching hundreds or thousands of people. Therefore, when training, attention must also be paid to selection, and after employment, it must be examined at any time. In addition, for suppressing bandits and investigating traitors, attention should be paid to the work of reconnaissance. Special training should be given to reconnaissance personnel, a reconnaissance network and communication network should be formed, and various communication, lookout, and liaison methods should be implemented, and it should be supervised at any time to prevent the disadvantages of being nominally or superficially compliant.</p>
<p>Local administrative commissioners should maintain close contact with the county party headquarters and district party headquarters, pay attention to young and promising party members, convene training, and use their expertise to assign them to organize Baojia, train the people, and carry out reconnaissance work, and encourage party members and young people to work hard and actively, and serve as the basic work in various places. It will have a great effect on promoting politics. In addition, local schools must also try to integrate them to achieve common promotion.</p>
<p>In the future, various localities should pay special attention to national physical education and social public health matters, reward promotion, and regard them as administrative priorities, so as to enhance the health and physique of the people. For public health, we should first practice cleanliness and disease prevention. Whether in urban or rural areas, if there are unburied coffins, they should be buried in the ground, and local areas should be encouraged to build public cemeteries.</p>
<p>Regarding maintaining order and reducing idleness, there are three things that should be paid attention to first: First, attention must be paid to the disposal and training of prisoners. All prisoners must not be concentrated in large cities, nor can they be left closed in prisons without management. They should be divided into juveniles, adults, and the elderly and weak, and given training separately, and given work, paying special attention to their lives and hygiene. Each commissioner must inspect the prisons when inspecting the counties, and must personally inspect the prisons in the county at least twice a month, and go to inspect them temporarily and regularly, so that the prison staff cannot have the opportunity to cover up and deceive. Second, attention must be paid to the management and transformation of vagrants and beggars, and proper resettlement methods must be devised. Third, attention must be paid to the situation and disposal of wounded soldiers in various places. Wounded soldiers must not be allowed to live in or near the provincial capital and cities for a long time. In addition to the wounded soldiers who have been settled by the central government, the remaining places should be properly settled by the local officials in appropriate locations, and jointly trained and managed by the commanders of the divisions and regimental districts.</p>
<p>The repair of rivers in various places is generally carried out diligently. Many areas in Henan Province have repaired rivers, but unfortunately there is no unified plan. As a result, the disadvantage of this section being repaired and that section not being repaired has occurred. For example, if the river passes through three administrative supervision zones of A, B, and C, if a section of the upper reaches is dredged very deeply, and a section in the middle belongs to another area, it will still be silted up, which will inevitably lead to more serious floods. Therefore, in the future, the dredging work should be based on the entire river as a unit, and the construction department of the provincial government should formulate a work plan for the entire repair and hand it over to the districts for implementation. It is not possible to use the area as a unit for each place, so that water conservancy can be developed and malpractices can be avoided.</p>
<p>For afforestation in various places, attention should be paid to promoting nurseries first. In Henan, Shandong, and Shaanxi provinces, nurseries must be promoted as much as possible. In the next five years, each county in each province should promote dozens of acres each year to cultivate seedlings and add forests. When the commissioners of various places come to Beijing for a meeting in the next year, they must have a detailed report on the area and quantity of promoting nurseries and adding forests, and the types of wood.</p>
<p>When repairing roads in various places, there are often reports that only the roadbed has been built and the repair has been completed, and the bridges or culverts have not been built uniformly. In this way, although there are highways, they are still unusable. In the future, when repairing roads, the work of bridges must be included. Whether it is planning construction or reporting work, bridges cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Regarding land administration, this decisive meeting has already discussed it. Whether handling measurement or land reporting, all provinces should regard it as the most important political affairs at present, and earnestly carry it out. It must be clear that our purpose is not to increase tax revenue, but to reorganize land and improve land as a basis for implementing equal land rights. It is necessary to complete the work of reorganizing land and improving land, and to know the actual situation of the land, before we can talk about the disposal of the land. Therefore, the work of reorganizing the land in the current stage must be completed as soon as possible in each province, overcoming all difficulties.</p>
<p>At present, the administrative supervision districts of various provinces are named with the numbers of the first and second classes, and some are named with geographical names. The names are not uniform. In the future, the names should be unified and uniformly marked with numbers.</p>
<p>The above points are all pointing out the areas that should be improved or paid attention to in the actual work. Today, due to time constraints, it is not possible to list them all. In the future, they can be instructed at any time. In short, everyone is engaged in administrative work in various places. To achieve effective results, you must pay attention everywhere, examine things, and correct mistakes immediately to seek progress. For the administrative orders, you must understand the essence, study the methods, and try to avoid the malpractice of perfunctory performance in form, reduce the work of filling out written reports, and do more on-the-spot inspections. You should also strive for the economy of time, manpower, and financial resources, seek reasonable cooperation in all allocation, eliminate boundaries, assist each other, coordinate each other, and more can reward talent, inspect subordinates, and strictly enforce rewards and punishments. Then, nothing will be impossible, and it will be possible to do a lot of work with a small amount of time and talent.</p>
<p>In addition, there is one more point that I feel is particularly important to the rise and fall of the country, and that is education. If we cannot thoroughly improve education in the future, and raise the position and character of those who are responsible for education as much as possible, then all work to save the country will not be able to start, and will be in vain. This meeting has already decided on many methods for promoting compulsory education and public education, and it is only necessary for everyone to promote them separately. However, I feel that the fundamental and urgent problem in education does not lie in the system, methods, and funding, but in the teachers. To improve the teachers, we must pay special attention to personality. All school teachers, etc., who have the responsibility of teaching people, whether they are in a country or a province, or in a township or a town, are not only teachers in a school, but are actually teachers and leaders who are admired and respected by the whole society. In the past, the so-called "scripture teachers and moral teachers" in China, such as the directors of academies and the teachers of rural schools, mostly shouldered the heavy responsibility of the time, were generally respected and feared, and were responsible for shifting the atmosphere and boosting people's hearts. Therefore, they must have a clean and noble style, a self-improvement cultivation, a firm and unyielding spirit, and uphold morality and righteousness, without avoiding harm. Whenever there is an extraordinary and violent attack, or an unexpected event, they must be firm and persevering, unyielding and unyielding, and be a model for future generations and a role model for society. At this time when the atmosphere is debauched, people's hearts are floating, etiquette and justice are unclear, and morality and shame are lost, if we want to save the country from disaster, we must first restore people's hearts and shift the atmosphere. To achieve this goal, we must rely on school teachers to cultivate their morals and strive to act, and take it as their own responsibility to save the world. In the past, the heads of education departments and the heads of education sections in various counties should have been scholars and officials who were role models for the literary world. They should have been self-disciplined with character and integrity. It must be known that educational administration is the basic work of struggling to save the country. Those who are responsible for educational administration must have the spirit of upholding righteousness and not yielding, and not avoiding dangers and sacrificing everything, in order to lead the masses, reform the stubborn and establish Confucianism, and fulfill the duties of education. Therefore, we must take responsibility for education in various places, not resign from labor and complaints, and implement the national education policy, and reform the lazy and chaotic atmosphere of the education sector. For the rectification and management of education, we must be kind to the good and evil to the evil, and stimulate integrity. Taking full responsibility for the country and the youth, there are indeed many teachers who are self-improving and self-respecting and worthy of being role models for young people, but there are also many who are perfunctory, or cater to students and cater to young people, only seeking to maintain their personal status and not hesitating to lose the dignity of teachers. This kind of teacher who abandons responsibility and is selfish and self-interested not only degrades himself, but also blemishes the sacred cause of education. What is even more serious is that they even use the weaknesses of young people as a tool to manipulate and cause trouble to seek personal advancement. This kind of behavior of misleading children is no different from selling the permanent interests of the nation, and its crime is actually better than that of the traitors who sell the country. To the extent of its disaster, it is enough to lose our next generation of citizens and trap the Chinese nation in a situation of no recovery. I believe that the revival of the country is entirely based on education. If education is bad, all political efforts will be equal to vanity, so I specifically bring it up, hoping that those who are responsible will be responsible and correct it, on the one hand, to save the decadent style, and on the other hand, to rectify the teachers. Then education will be enough to save the country, and will not lead to the country's demise through education. This paragraph not only hopes that the heads of various education departments will pay attention to it, but also hopes that the administrative personnel of all levels attending the meeting will pay full attention to it. In short, the danger of the country today cannot be described in words. Since everyone is determined to fight for the country and devote themselves to political work, they must recognize the environment in which the country is and the historical mission they are shouldering, and unite as a whole, be determined, and strive to break the extraordinary difficulties. Our greatest goal is to complete the construction of a modern country. In the future, all political facilities should meet this requirement in order to achieve the mission of national revival. I hope that you will work hard on this basis and strive for progress, so that you can show greater and better results when you gather again next year. This is my sincere expectation.</p>

<p>(Washington) In view of the news of large-scale military actions by Japan in North China, the State Department today reiterated its official statement that the United States upholds the Nine-Power Treaty and guarantees China's independence and territorial integrity. Secretary Phillips declared that the United States' diplomatic stance remains the same as the outline of the statement made by Secretary of State Hull on December 5th of last year. At that time, Mr. Hull stated, "The United States firmly believes in the fundamental principles of its traditional policy and abides by the treaties concluded by all nations." Subsequently, a State Department official stated that Mr. Phillips' reiteration of his previous statement was not a diplomatic warning to Japan, but merely a declaration of the United States' moral position. (National News Agency telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, when the State Department met with reporters, many inquired about Japan's increase in troops stationed in North China, or asked whether the US government had studied the matter to determine whether this action by Japan violated the Boxer Protocol. Deputy Secretary of State Phillips replied that Secretary of State Hull stated on December 5th of last year that the United States could not sit idly by and watch the autonomy movement underway in North China at that time, and asked all countries to respect existing treaties. Today, the United States still holds this attitude. It is noted that Mr. Hull's statement last December stated that any extraordinary development in any part of China is certainly not only related to the United States and the Chinese people, but also involves many countries and people with interests in China, because in their relations with China, the treaty rights and obligations of the treaty countries are equally applicable. The United States has the same interests in North China as other countries, so the US government is closely monitoring the progress there. During this period of global political turmoil and economic panic, governments and peoples of all countries must maintain the integrity of principles and promises. (Reuters telegram, 16th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The draft budget for the 11th year of Showa (1936) was approved by the House of Representatives in its original form on the 16th and delivered to the House of Peers that evening. With only eight days remaining in the session of the House of Peers, it is scheduled to hold a continued meeting on Sunday, the 17th, to deliberate on the budget. In the morning, Finance Minister Baba explained the content. In the afternoon, a general budget meeting was held, with questions from Kiso Hide, Sekiya Teizaburo, and others. General budget meetings will continue on the 18th and 19th. Subcommittee meetings will be held on the 20th and 21st. The attitudes of various factions will be decided on the 22nd, and the full session will formally decide on the final day of the session, the 24th. As for other important bills, it seems likely that the session will be extended to allow for deliberation due to insufficient time. (Domei News Agency telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Because the general budget and supplementary budget for the 11th year of Showa (1936) have been approved by the House of Representatives and were delivered on the 16th evening, the House of Peers held a meeting at 10:10 AM today, even though it was Sunday. The gallery was also full. Prime Minister Hirota and all cabinet members attended. First, Finance Minister Baba gave a speech on finance, the same as the one in the House of Representatives. Then, Agriculture Minister Shimada submitted the silkworm cocoon processing control law and explained that it was now entrusted to a special committee. Regarding the Tsushima incident, he presented a report on punishment and opened a secret meeting. Then, Councilman Akaike Nou raised questions to the Ministers of State regarding their speeches, stating:</p>
<p>What is most worrisome recently is diplomacy towards China and the Soviet Union. What are the government's views?</p>
<p>Prime Minister's Reply: Regarding diplomacy toward China and the Soviet Union, the government has been particularly careful to adopt a policy of good neighborliness, but in reality, it is extremely difficult to achieve. As for China's negative voices towards Japan, the center of the Nanjing government has not shown any deterioration towards Japan. Once they have a full understanding of Japan, there will inevitably be a time for understanding to arrive. The movements of European and American countries in China are mostly economic, so there may be intrusions by Europe and America into China. If Japan wants to maintain complete friendship with China, it must be achieved through mutual harmonization of the two peoples.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister's Reply: Japan's policy towards China and the Soviet Union should be based on the relationship between Japan, China, and Manchukuo. Whether there is a secret relationship between China and the Soviet Union is not yet fully known. The Soviet Union's strengthening of its military preparations in the Far East is due to the Soviet Union's insufficient understanding of Japan's position in the Far East, which leads to suspicion and fear. Japan should make them deeply aware of this. I was ordered to be an envoy to China, and I felt that recently the relationship between China and Japan has not been entirely harmonious, so it should be harmonized. The anti-Japanese movement among Chinese students hinders Japan's approach to the Nanjing government. Regardless of the situation, we should strive to adjust Sino-Japanese diplomacy. European and American capital has already entered China, and if there are attempts to exclude Japan, it should be considered. But the reality is probably not as bad as the rumors suggest. As for the alliance of foreign financial groups and Chinese forces, there are various rumors. This matter should be paid close attention to. The cultural enterprise fund contains the ideal of allowing the Chinese people to understand Japan a hundred years from now, so there is no intention to use it for other purposes.</p>
<p>Then, Baron Asada Yoshitsu questioned the Minister of the Army about military interference in politics. The Minister of the Army replied that the military was studying politics from the broad perspective of national defense, out of necessity, and so on. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.

<p>(London) The British "Lanool" newspaper published an article today commenting on the future naval talks between Britain and Russia, stating that Russia may not sign any treaty that does not allow it to place a fleet in the Baltic Sea capable of repelling the German navy, and a fleet in the Far East capable of protecting its coast against the Japanese navy. The main demand in the Soviet Union's memorandum to England is that the Baltic Fleet and the Far East Fleet that the Soviet Union intends to deploy must be regarded as two absolutely separate entities. The Soviet Union does not demand ratios for either of these two fleets. The Soviet Union relies on the fleet only for defense, and what it emphasizes is that its air force is superior to Japan or even Germany. (Reuters telegram, 17th)</p>

<p>New York It is rumored that as a result of recent talks between Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Chen Guangfu, the US government is considering purchasing large quantities of Chinese silver. The purchase method will be similar to a loan, but cannot be considered a formal loan. The financial community is paying close attention to this statement today. Some believe that the United States may purchase Chinese silver according to the Silver Purchase Act and store it in the vaults of American banks in the Shanghai International Settlement. Once the Chinese government repays the silver purchase funds, the original silver will be returned. Spokesmen for the Treasury Department and Mr. Chen both stated that they were unaware of this matter. However, some economists believe that this plan is possible because, in fact, although the stored silver has been handed over to American control, it can avoid the formality of silver flowing out. It is understood that Mr. Chen and others have conducted informal investigations into the possibility of American investment in China, but feel that there is no hope at present. Although the US Export-Import Bank can provide short-term loans for specific business plans, there are currently no powerful bankers or investors who can participate in the plans proposed by the Chinese side. It is understood that the plan is to organize a US-China investment company to develop various enterprises, or to invest in Chinese railways or factories solely by the United States. However, those who proposed this plan on the Chinese side all wanted to jointly invest or participate in management. Officials from the Export-Import Bank also admitted to discussing Chinese business plans, but said they could not announce any decisions. (National News Agency telegram, 16th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Based on the speeches of Finance Minister Baba and Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Finance Nakajima in the Diet, the Japanese financial community has judged Baba's financial trends in finance and is closely monitoring its development. The outline of the so-called Baba financial policy includes the thorough reorganization of Japanese financial institutions. The main points are as follows: Completely unify the supervisory powers of various financial institutions that previously belonged to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and Ministry of Communications under the Ministry of Finance; Strengthen the functions of ordinary banks with the Bank of Japan as the center, and the government should provide appropriate facilities for special financial undertakings from the perspective of social policy; Strengthen the special banking system. Special banks such as the Korean and Taiwanese banks are tied to Japan's northward and southward policies, so their functions must be extremely strengthened to meet policy needs.

<p>(Rome) The order for Italy to annex Abyssinia and establish a Fascist empire was unanimously passed by the Chamber of Deputies yesterday. The Senate also held an extraordinary meeting and approved it. All senators wore black shirts, and members of the royal family such as the Count of Turin and the Duke of Genoa were also present. The diplomatic corps included the deposed Spanish King Alfonso XIII, the ambassadors of Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, and the United States, and the ministers of Austria and Hungary. When Prime Minister Mussolini arrived, the entire audience stood up and cheered in salute. Crown Prince Piedmont followed and was also welcomed by the senators. Speaker Fontasani spoke first, explaining that the establishment of the Italian Empire was of great importance. "Italy's actions are only aimed at safeguarding its life and future destiny, but other countries have imposed brutal economic sanctions on Italy. From a legal point of view, this method is absurd. It is regrettable that other countries are willing to use Italy as a test product." Reporter Marconi (the inventor of wireless telegraphy) then took the stage to deliver a speech, saying, "The ring of Italy's revival ideals has been firmly completed with the annexation of Abyssinia." He also said that since 1860, Italy has repeatedly tried to expand in East Africa, but Abyssinia's usurping tyrants have either secretly or openly obstructed it, so that Italy's efforts have often been destroyed. Today, the situation has become more serious, and it is impossible to establish a compromise plan. Italy has no choice but to resort to war. What Italy seeks is only to instill civilization in East Africa, and at the same time to cooperate with Europe in a faithful manner for the balance and peace." Then the Prime Minister presented the annexation order for reading without delivering a speech. The order was finally unanimously passed by 337 senators (including a few senators who did not join the Fascist Party). At the end of the meeting, the whole audience shouted "Long live the Emperor" and "Long live the Prime Minister", the sound shook the building, and the scene was extremely grand.

As for the 200,000 francs that Guatemala owes in membership fees, they will be paid in full. (Havas Agency telegram, 17th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The Cabinet today decided to demobilize the conscripts of the 1933 and 1934 classes who were drafted into the army in March when Germany reoccupied the Rhineland. These conscripts were sent to eastern France to strengthen the strength of the border defense forces. (Reuters telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Cabinet recently held a state council meeting, chaired by President Lebrun. Foreign Minister Flandin and Minister without Portfolio Poncet presented a detailed report on the current diplomatic situation. The State Council then decided to allow the new recruits of 1933 and 1934 to be discharged from the army by the deadline. A total of 9,000 of these new recruits were originally scheduled to be dismissed in March of this year, but due to the sudden outbreak of the Rhine River issue at the time and the resulting tension in the international situation, they remained in the army until now. After the meeting, Foreign Minister Flandin plans to go to the southern coast for a few days of rest. During his absence from the capital, external affairs will be handled by Minister without Portfolio Poncet. (Havas</p>

<p>(Berlin) A French veterans' organization previously sent a telegram to the Führer Hitler, advocating that France and Germany should immediately resolve their grievances and reconcile. The Führer has now replied, and the reply has been read to the leaders of the Nazi veterans' association. It roughly stated: "We veterans, during the European War, all demonstrated courage. Now, for the sake of harmony between the French and German nations and the creation of a European peace mechanism, it is our right to speak out. As for us German veterans, we are earnestly willing to rebuild a European peace mechanism. This peace mechanism should not only be based on the feelings of comradeship and mutual respect, but also on a pragmatic awareness. The former feeling was fully expressed when we were digging trenches against each other during the European War, and the latter awareness has been deeply felt by us through the severe lessons of the European War. However, the German nation loves honor and does not want to lag behind other countries. The peace it seeks is only a peace based on absolute equality of rights. We and your people must share the same mind and reason on this point." (Havas, 16th)</p>

<p>Warsaw: The main points of the new cabinet of Sławoj Składkowski are two: one is to alleviate unemployment, and the other is to strengthen national defense. Regarding the issue of alleviating unemployment, the previous cabinet of Kościałkowski originally planned to implement a large-scale engineering plan, but it failed to do so due to a lack of authority and the failure to take the necessary financial measures. The current cabinet, with the support of the army, has stronger power than before and should be able to raise the necessary funds to implement the plan. Although government spending will increase as a result, the stability of the currency should still be maintained. Regarding the issue of strengthening national defense, since the German army entered the Rhineland region in March, the movement to promote military build-up in Poland has been very active. The authorities are doing everything possible to make people interested in various military issues. Recently, all the workers of the Warsaw Armory voluntarily donated 100 machine guns and 50,000 grenades. Officers of the army and the Anti-Aircraft Association raised funds to purchase 13 aircraft and 30 gliders to donate to the military. The workers of various optical instrument factories also volunteered to increase their working hours by 10,000 hours without compensation. In addition, the staff of the Ministry of Interior has raised funds to donate an aircraft. Newspapers across the country have also started fundraising to purchase aircraft. (Havas, 16th)</p>

<p>Warsaw: The quick resolution of the Polish cabinet crisis was due to the fact that the crisis had long been anticipated. The Kościałkowski cabinet had recently encountered various difficulties and was strongly opposed by the powerful "Colonels' Group," which believed that the recent riots in Lwów, which resulted in numerous deaths and injuries, were due to the government's laissez-faire policy. The new cabinet is taking a "strong" policy approach. The new Prime Minister is a close friend of General Piłsudski, so under his leadership, the power of the military will naturally increase. (National News Agency, 16th)</p>

This trend may not be able to compromise with leftists. This alone is enough to prove the importance of this cabinet reorganization. Several questions are still in doubt, but this list of cabinet members cannot be said to not be moving towards an authoritarian government. This is the government that the so-called "Colonels' Group" has been seeking all day long. The newspaper concluded that, in general, the new cabinet organization is a manifestation of national unity, as it accommodates all factions of General Piłsudski. (National News Agency, 17th)</p>

<p>Athens: Former Prime Minister Tsaldares died of a cerebral hemorrhage at 1:30 this morning. Tsaldares was born in 1868 and was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1910. He served as Minister of Justice in 1915 and Minister of Interior in 1920. In October 1932, he was appointed to form a cabinet, and in March of last year, he formed a cabinet again. He resigned after the restorationist movement began and was succeeded by former Prime Minister Kondylis, who held a referendum to welcome King George II back to the country to restore the throne. Tsaldares was physically strong. He attended a committee of the Chamber of Deputies last night and showed no signs of illness. He went to bed peacefully at midnight, but suddenly felt a severe cough an hour later and fainted. Medical treatment was unable to save him. Recently, elderly Greek statesmen have been passing away one after another. Former Prime Minister Kondylis died suddenly at his residence, Venizelos died in Paris, and now Tsaldares has suddenly passed away. It is truly sad. (Havas, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e70">Political Turmoil Brewing in Germany; Schacht and the Nazi Party Hold Increasingly Different Views <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) A special correspondent for this newspaper reports that the differences between the Minister of Economics and President of the Reichsbank Schacht and important members of the Nazi Party have been long-standing. Recently, the irreconcilable differences between the two sides have become increasingly apparent, so rumors that Schacht will be forced to resign are rife. Here are a few recent events to support this: First, according to financial figures, after Führer Hitler recently returned to Berlin from his villa in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria, Schacht quietly left Berlin the next night for Badenweiler, as if he did not want to meet the Führer. Second, Schacht's newspaper, the "German Economic News," published an article at the end of last month stating, "To make the unemployed gain work and not hesitate to hurt the people and waste money to build 'pyramids' is economically absurd." The words clearly mocked the Führer. Führer Hitler delivered a speech on May 1, National Labor Day, in which he said, "Those who used people to build pyramids, although more than 4,000 years have passed since today, their reputation is still immortal." These words were clearly aimed at the article in the "German Economic News." At that time, the Nazi Party's newspapers all published the Führer's speech with large headlines, saying that the Führer replied to a certain senior official with this, and that there was no one better than him in terms of wording. Until recently, when an economic conference was held here, a close confidant of the Führer, Keppler, also quoted Hitler's speech in a teasing tone. When Mr. Schacht's representative heard this, he immediately left the meeting. The state of mutual animosity between the two sides is clearly visible. Second, the Nazi Party says that Schacht uses economic needs as an excuse to arbitrarily supervise the policies implemented by the Nazi Party. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? At the same time, it is an open secret that Labor Front leader Ley and several local Nazi Party branch leaders strongly oppose Schacht's potential power. Fourth, after Aviation Minister General Göring took on the new mission of controlling the nation's raw materials and exchange rights, he has now decided to organize another agency to manage economic affairs, with State Secretary Kröte, Secretary-General of the Prussian Provincial Government, in charge. He is a spokesman for the Rhine steel industry and advocates a mark devaluation policy, which is incompatible with Schacht's policies. Economic figures here all say that it will not be easy for the two to work together in the future. Unless Führer Hitler personally comes forward to resolve the issue, there may be a cabinet crisis.

<p>— Chen Kezhong, Full-time Compiler, National Institute for Compilation and Translation</p>
<p>China's coal production ranks third in the world, but unfortunately, it is not fully utilized. According to research, coal consumption is distributed as follows: 43.2% for household use, 32.6% for factory use, 8.4% for transportation, and 8% for coal mines' own use. It is a pity that most of China's coal is used for direct combustion. Only Jingxing in Hebei province has a coke-making factory that extracts by-products, but the output is small and the prospects are not optimistic.</p>
<p>Regarding medicine, coal tar produces many products, and medicines are an important part of them. For example, picric acid is a good yellow dye and also an excellent antiseptic for major wounds. The extraction of medicines from coal was invented sixty years ago. For example, in 1870, the German chemist Kolbe evaporated carbolic acid from coal tar to make salicylic acid, which can be used to treat epilepsy. If acetic anhydride is added, aspirin for headaches can be made. However, before coal tar was used, chemists had already invented many important medicines. For example, in 1831, the famous German chemist Liebig mixed bleaching powder and alcohol to invent chloroform. We know that chloroform is an anesthetic that is essential for surgery. In the past, many wounded soldiers became disabled or died after being injured. Since the invention of chloroform, it has relieved countless human suffering and death. Another anesthetic commonly used in surgery is ether, which was invented in the 13th century, but its anesthetic effect was not discovered until 1842. In these hundreds of years, without anesthetics, tens of millions of people have suffered unnecessarily from surgery, which proves that medicine must cooperate with chemistry to progress. Regarding hypnotics, an earlier invention was trichloroacetaldehyde (Chloral), but this drug often has other adverse effects on the human body. Later, after research by chemists, Veronal and Sulphonal were invented. These two drugs still have problems because they can be addictive with long-term use. Now, chemists have invented Luminal and Adalin, which have the effects of the previous hypnotics but with greatly reduced toxicity. There is also naturally produced cocaine, which was previously used as a local anesthetic, but this drug is like morphine: it is highly toxic and addictive once used. Therefore, to avoid this drawback, chemists invented Encaine and Novocaine. These two drugs are much better than the original natural product. In the past, surgery required general anesthesia, but now it can be replaced by local anesthesia. These are all contributions of chemists to medicine. There is also a drug called adrenaline, which was invented in 1901. This drug has many uses and is very effective. In surgery, if a patient is injected with this drug, it can constrict the blood vessels of the body, causing the blood to completely run away from the injected area. As a result, the doctor does not see blood when making incisions. This drug is extracted from a gland on the kidneys of animals. It is said that extracting one pound of adrenaline requires two thousand cattle, which is costly and cruel. But now, chemists know the structure of the drug, so they can manufacture it artificially on a large scale. China has a long history of medicinal materials, but in the past, people did not use scientific methods to study and improve them, so there was no progress for thousands of years. Recently, people have begun to use new chemical methods for research. In the past, there had been very good results in studies of Ephedra, Angelica and so on. There is great hope for such research, and we should work harder. Since the introduction of Western medicine into China, the debate between traditional Chinese and Western medicine has not stopped. In our fair opinion, the theories and methods on which Chinese medicine is based have many points that are questionable. However, the medicines used by Chinese medicine to treat diseases are worth studying and cannot be dismissed completely. If we can use scientific methods to study Chinese medicine, we believe that the gap between these two fields will one day disappear completely.</p>
<p>Regarding chemical weapons, all of the above are beneficial to mankind. Chemistry also has great power in the area of destruction. Modern weapons such as steel for making guns and artillery, alloys for aircraft, all explosives, toxic gases, and fuels rely on the chemical industry. For clarity, I will briefly talk about chemistry's contributions in this area:</p>
<p>Steel and Alloys: Due to time constraints, this issue cannot be discussed in detail, but I can tell you a point or two. First, China's steel production is very weak. The reserves of iron ore are not abundant, and the exploitation and refining of most iron ore are controlled by foreigners. The steelmaking industry is still in its infancy. Here is a simple table of world steel production (1933) for comparison, so that everyone can see how serious the problem of my steel is.</p>
<p>Second, aluminum is a very important raw material for aircraft manufacturing. We are now only advocating aircraft for national salvation, but we must know that the life of an aircraft is very limited. No matter which country in the world, if it does not find a way to manufacture it itself, the slogan of promoting aviation is just empty talk. The aluminum needed to manufacture aircraft can be extracted from alum, which is abundant in our country. According to a survey by the Central Geological Survey Institute, the reserves of alunite in Pingyang, Zhejiang, are as high as 300 million tons, which is considered the most abundant alunite mine in the world. If we can find a way to extract the aluminum from the alum in a very economical way, it would be of great benefit to national defense. The Huanghai Chemical Industry Society and the Academia Sinica are working hard on research. Not long ago, people from the Geological Survey Institute of the Ministry of Industry and the China Chemical Industry Research Institute also studied this question. If the research is successful in the future, not only will the aluminum problem be solved, but also the fertilizer problem can be partially solved, because alum contains potassium, which is necessary for fertilizer.</p>
<p>Explosives: Regarding explosives, everyone knows that the first explosives used were black powder, which produced a lot of black smoke when detonated. Later, after gradual improvements by chemists, there are now many types of explosives, and their power is very great. Now I will introduce to you several important inventions in explosives: The first major invention was nitrocellulose, invented in 1846 by the German chemist Schonbein in Switzerland. Cotton becomes nitrocellulose after being treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. This nitrocellulose contains 12.3% nitrogen, burns without smoke, and has great destructive power, far beyond what the old black powder could compare to. Because it does not produce smoke when burned, this medicine is called smokeless powder. The second major invention was nitroglycerin, invented in 1847 by the Italian chemist Sobrero. This substance can be obtained by treating glycerol with a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid. This explosive is very easy to detonate. If no method is found to improve it, it is difficult to apply. Soon, the Swiss Nobel accidentally discovered that diatomaceous earth could absorb nitroglycerin and make it safe to transport. The dynamite we usually hear about is this diatomaceous earth that absorbs nitroglycerin. Later, Nobel father and son accidentally invented that nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin could be made into a gelatinous substance. This explosive is convenient to transport and has extremely great explosive power, even more powerful than nitrocellulose or nitroglycerin. In addition, there are two other terrible explosives: the first is picric acid, which can be obtained by treating carbolic acid with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. We mentioned above that picric acid is a good disinfectant and dye, and also a good explosive. The second is T.N.T.. We can obtain a product called toluene by distilling coal tar, which can be burned and turns into T.N.T. after being treated with nitric acid. This explosive is not easy to ignite and will not explode even if it is impacted under normal circumstances, but once it explodes, its destructive power is very great. Although there are many types of explosives in various countries now, the basic explosives are nothing more than these few. From the above, we can see that explosives must use nitric acid. Before the European War, the source of nitric acid was almost entirely from Chilean nitrates. After the European War, the supply of nitrates was manufactured from inexhaustible nitrogen in the air. During the European War, the Allied forces tried their best to cut off Germany's nitrogen supply, but Germany still had a constant source of nitrogen because of Haber's method of extracting nitrogen from the air. If Germany did not have Haber's invention of extracting nitrogen from the air at that time, we believe that Germany would have been defeated within a year after the outbreak of war.</p>

<p>On the 6th, I was waiting for a train in Anlu. To avoid the hustle and bustle, I changed my lodging to outside the city. In the evening, two government policemen from the county came to my lodging, supposedly to inspect travelers. I immediately told them my background, but their intention was not here. They urgently asked for 60 copper coins and swaggered away. This kind of extortion is called "lamp oil money." I don't know what it is used for, and no receipt was issued. I heard that some people are charged and some are exempted. Workers, farmers, and merchants are definitely charged, while those in government, military, and academic circles are definitely exempted. I suspect that the government police are cheating. If it is a county government regulation, it shouldn't be so unfair. That night, I stayed in my lodging. All around were fields, which gave me a sense of tranquility. Only the croaking of frogs was noisy, which disturbed my sleep, but it refreshed my mind. The small annoyances are worth the chatter.</p>
<p>I woke up on the morning of the 7th, seeing the sky slightly cloudy, with a hint of rain. My heart thumped, because the Xianghua Road had been in disrepair for many years. Once it rained, the car could not run for several days, and Anlu was suffering from a spring famine, waiting for wheat to save it. If there was heavy rain again, it would be difficult to harvest, which would greatly affect the people's food. At 8 o'clock, three cars came from Huayuan, full of passengers. Those waiting for the car crowded on, like snatching a trophy. The road was built according to the mountains and rivers, winding like a belt. From Anlu to Suixian, it is as long as 130 li, passing through Pinglin Port, Maping, Zhehe, and other places. Pinglin and Maping belong to Yingshan, and Zhehe belongs to Suixian, all of which are larger towns. Earth walls and stone bunkers are built to prevent bandits, and the battlements are clearly visible, which shows that banditry is rampant, and it is no longer the peaceful scene of Anlu. The food sold along the way is mostly fried dough sticks and sesame cakes. Men on the road all walk, while women ride mules, looking around from the saddle, calm and leisurely, with a northern flavor. Most of the wheat seedlings in the fields are not yet ripe. The number of beggars is similar to that on the way from Huayuan to Anlu, but there are fewer within Yingshan, which makes me suspect that the famine in Yingshan is not as severe as that in Anlu. When I asked a fellow passenger, I learned that the county was more severely affected by the disaster, exceeding Anlu several times. According to him, "The county has many mountains and few fields, and its output is not abundant. In the past eight years, there have been natural disasters and man-made disasters every year. In the 17th year of the Republic, bandits captured the city, occupying it for two days and nights. In addition to burning, killing, and looting, they kidnapped three or four thousand hostages from the city and countryside, and many have not returned to this day. In the winter of the 18th year, the Dengdian area in the east and the Lengjiawan area in the west were also harassed by the Red Bandits. In the summer of the 19th year, mountain floods broke out, and people and animals drifted away. In the winter of the year, a large group of Henan bandits sneaked in, destroying most of Maping Street and kidnapping 2,000 hostages. In the 20th year, the Henan bandits came again, harassing the entire county. The northwest countryside was occupied by them for more than a year. From the 22nd year to the 24th year, the entire county suffered a drought, with extremely heavy losses. This year, the Henan bandits have sneaked in twice, coupled with the spring famine, the rich have become poor, and the poor have died. Those who survived have become beggars, and because the territory is poor, they have to beg in neighboring counties, so the local area feels scarce. Now, of the beggars in Anlu and Suixian, two or three out of ten are natives, and seven or eight out of ten are from Yingshan. This kind of situation is not known to outsiders." Another guest talked about the relief last year, saying, "Last year's drought was most severe in Yingshan among the nearby counties, but Yingshan received the least relief funds, because the provincial authorities sent people to investigate the disaster. Once they arrived in the county seat, they stayed indoors and rarely went out. Because they did not see the victims, they reported that the disaster was not very severe, and the relief funds were distributed very little. Although it was an unintentional mistake, many people in Ying died of starvation as a result." The speakers were not from Yingshan, which should be the truth.</p>
<p>At 11 o'clock, the car arrived in Suixian. Sui was a great power in the Spring and Autumn Period, and it is still an important town in northern Hubei. It was originally the seat of the administrative commissioner of the Fifth District, but now it has been changed to the Third District. The commissioner is still stationed here. The area under its jurisdiction has increased from six counties to ten counties. There is an earth wall outside the county seat and a stone city inside, with a majestic appearance. As soon as I entered the city, there was a heavy rain, and my clothes were all wet. Thinking of the spring famine in various counties, I couldn't help but worry.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Smuggled Goods Seized in Wuhu: Coal Ship Carried Artificial Silk, Wooden Raft Hidden with Tung Oil <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The problem of smuggling affects our country's tax revenue and the market, which has alarmed the people of the country, and its scope is expanding, even affecting the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and various parts of South China. The Wuhu Customs has been paying close attention to this matter. Recently, a merchant ship from Dalian loaded with smoke coal arrived in Wuhu and unloaded it at the Shengtiaheng Coal Depot for sale. When the ship arrived at the Wusongkou, the Wuhu Customs received a secret telegram stating that the ship carried a large amount of smuggled artificial silk and other goods. Therefore, when the ship arrived at the port, the Wuhu Customs Commissioner sent a number of customs officers on motorboats to monitor the ship and immediately prohibited it from docking. They searched first, but the smugglers were unusually cunning. Although they searched for two hours, they found nothing. Finally, the shipowner issued a certificate, and under surveillance, the coal was unloaded. At this time, the customs received another secret Japanese telegram, which was entrusted by the shipowner to be forwarded to the escort. It was also discovered that when unloading the coal, someone from the ship landed and planned to hire a boat to transport the goods, but did not clearly indicate the location to the boatman. The behavior was suspicious, which increased suspicion. After the ship set sail and sailed downstream, another person was sent to follow it. The ship transferred the Zhongxing Coal to Japan in Pukou. As a result, at the moment of opening the cabin, it was found that there was a dark room in the middle cabin containing smuggled artificial silk and silk fabrics worth more than 7,000 yuan. It was immediately confiscated, and the shipowner was fined 500 yuan before it ended. Also, the night before, a batch of huge wooden rafts was towed by Wenhai Steamboat, passing along the north bank of the Yangtze River from the upper reaches. The customs saw it from the observation deck and felt suspicious. They immediately sent a speedboat to pursue and seized more than 600 pieces of tax-evading tung oil (i.e., high-quality tung oil) under the raft gear, worth more than 10,000 yuan. It was immediately confiscated. According to the Wenhai shipowner, the wooden raft was towed from Hankou to Zhenjiang and did not know that there was smuggled tung oil. Therefore, the customs are now pursuing the cargo owner for legal action. (16th)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Large Volume of Anhui Tea Transported to Shanghai - Jiangnan Railway Reduces Grain Freight Rates <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: After Anhui Province implemented the unified control of black tea transportation and sales, this year's exports include more than 7,000 boxes from the Anhui Tea Improvement Farm, 35,000 boxes from the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Transportation and Sales Association, and more than 60,000 boxes of Maibian and Huizhou green tea. The black tea transportation is unified by the Transportation and Sales Association, and a temporary agreement is signed with the National Economic Commission, the Qimen Tea Industry Improvement Farm, the Jiangnan Company, and the Anhui Provincial Highway Bureau. The freight rate is based on each box as a unit. If it exceeds 40 kilograms, it is counted as two boxes. The Road Bureau transports goods from Qimen to Xuancheng via the provincial village road at a cost of 1 yuan and 81 cents per box. The Jiangnan Railway transports goods from Xuancheng to Shanghai via Wuhu, which is contracted by the Jiangnan Road for a fee of 3 yuan and 4 cents. The total cost is 2 yuan and 15 cents per box, which is several times lower than the freight rate in previous years, so tea merchants benefit greatly. Tea production has a certain period, and the transportation time is also set from the beginning of May to the end of July. The Jiangnan Road has specially assigned Zhang Yuerang to set up a temporary business office in Qimen to handle the filling and issuing of combined transport cargo tickets for this transportation method. According to the latest statistics, more than 3,000 boxes have been transported to Shanghai. In addition, in order to develop freight business and assist in the transportation and sales of agricultural products in southern Anhui, the Jiangnan Road has recently agreed with the Beijing-Shanghai Road to reduce all grain freight rates from the 12th of this month. The cost from Wuhu to Yaohuamen, Nanjing, will be reduced by 46% according to the fifth-class freight rate. The cost from Yaohuamen to Shanghai will be reduced by 20%. Therefore, the freight cost from Wuhu to Shanghai for rice, wheat, rapeseed, etc. is 4 yuan and 4 jiao per ton, which is equal to the water transport price, but its speed and simplicity of procedures are much more convenient.

<h3 id="e78">Guangzhou's Money Market is Tight: Silver Industry Asks for a Loan of 5 Million Yuan to Facilitate the Turnover of the Financial Market <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The business market in Guangdong Province is depressed, and all industries feel that the money market is tight and it is difficult to turn over. At the end of last year, the government once held a commercial loan, but the amount of the loan was not much, the procedures were complicated, and the interest rate was very high, so most merchants did not get real benefits. After the beginning of spring, the business of all industries has not improved, and the silver industry has almost stopped the mortgage loans. The reason is that there are few lenders and many borrowers. The cash of silver companies is limited and cannot fully supply the demand. Recently, the Silver Industry has specially asked the government to allocate a loan of 5 million yuan to facilitate the turnover of the financial market. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the City Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the Guangdong Political Research Association to request the authorities. The letter stated: "It is an obvious fact that the money market is tight. The silver companies affiliated with the association have a close relationship with all industries. In the past, funds flowed to each other, but now the silver companies are worried about the lack of cash, and more and more are closing down. Those who are still struggling to support themselves also feel that the world is depressed and there is no business to run. As a result, silver companies and all industries are caught in the trap of inflexible turnover. At the same time, the government's tax revenue and the people's livelihood are affected. The so-called people are not enough, how can the king be enough? At this time of tight money market, the silver companies are on the verge of extinction, and their only hope is that the government will provide effective relief. Checking the relief measures is like treating a disease, but only by observing the crux of the problem can it be effective. It is like a patient suffering from anemia, and the body is weak to the extreme. It is impossible to survive unless the blood circulation is replenished. What the silver companies are suffering from today is a lack of cash. Since there is no magic to turn stones into gold, there is only the road to death. The government maintains finance within its capacity, and how can it bear to ignore it? Moreover, since the government announced the policy of managing currency, the promotion of legal currency is intended to respond to the needs of society. If we know that the needs of society are urgent, we should find ways to respond. The association has silently observed that the financial crisis is more severe than ever. After discussion at the Standing Committee, it was believed that the current need should be to ask the government to allocate a large amount of funds to allow silver companies to borrow at low interest rates. The resolution was passed, and it should be requested in accordance with the case for relief. Checking the demand for funds in the market last year to celebrate the New Year, the bank was once allowed to release funds, but at that time, each company was only allowed to borrow 5,000 yuan, which was a very small amount. The time was short and the interest rate was very high, which was a drop in the bucket. At this time, if the government is determined to provide relief, the following points should be noted: the amount must be increased, please allocate 5 million yuan, and each silver company may borrow up to 100,000 yuan; the interest rate must be reduced, and the weekly interest should not exceed 3%; the collateral must be flexible, in addition to the property being assessed slightly higher, please also consider the status of the silver company. The implementation of this measure to rescue the silver industry is to rescue all industries. For the province, it can recover interest and increase people's faith. For the government, it can nurture tax sources and demonstrate official-commercial cooperation. It is a matter of doing many good things at once, which is the most urgent thing at present. The letter should be sent to your association for verification, hoping that you will forward it to the Guangdong Political Research Association to petition the government to allocate a large amount of funds to allow the silver companies to borrow at low interest rates to maintain the market and save the merchants from difficulties."

<h3 id="e79">Shantou: Construction of the Hanjiang Railway Bridge, Construction Cost is 100,000 Yuan, Estimated to be Completed in Six Months <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Shantou and the Chaoshan Railway Station are separated by a river, which is inconvenient for travel. A wooden bridge was built once to facilitate pedestrians, but vehicles could not pass, so transportation was still inconvenient. A few years ago, Li Yangjing, a member of the East District Pacification Department, wanted to facilitate military transportation, and the city government also wanted to prosper Shantou, so he convened representatives from all walks of life to discuss the construction of a railway bridge. He then ordered the Chaoshan Railway Company to be responsible for its completion. However, although the plan was set, it was not built for a long time. Until the winter of last year, Li Hanhun succeeded Li Yangjing as a member of the East District Pacification Department, and the old matter was brought up again, ordering the company to start construction as soon as possible in accordance with the original plan. After receiving the order, the company also believed that the matter was related to transportation and did not want to delay it, so it handed over the entire project to the Dutch merchant Kaijian Foreign Company for contracting. The construction cost is a total of 100,000 yuan. Pile driving started last month, first building the southern bridge pier, and then building the northern pier, so as not to hinder the passing ships. The bridge is 256 feet long and 25 feet wide, with eight bridge piers, each 22 feet apart. The bridge deck is divided into three roads. The middle road is for vehicles, 10 feet wide, and both sides are for walking, 5 feet wide each. The docking is in the south of the bridge, which is opened and closed by manpower. It is estimated that it will be completed in six months. Now, because the bridge pier is being built, and the water flow is turbulent, the construction is quite difficult, so it may be delayed. It is expected to take more than a few months longer than the originally scheduled time to complete.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Yellow River Tail End Siltation and Wasteland: Disaster Victims Relocated for Reclamation; Situation at the Yellow River Estuary Changes Again <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Yellow River tail end areas of Lijin and Zhanhua are vast stretches of silted wasteland urgently needing reclamation. Since last year, the Shandong Provincial Government has been relocating disaster victims from western Shandong to these areas for reclamation, with some success achieved over the past year. This year, because the closure of the Yellow River estuary was delayed, the disaster victims returned home, missing the spring planting season. Therefore, the Provincial Government is organizing relocation and reclamation on an even larger scale, achieving two goals at once. Provincial Councilor Zhen Ji was appointed as the Director of the Disaster Victim Relocation and Reclamation Office, with Zhao Mingyuan, the First Route Commander of the Militia, as Deputy Director. Zhen went to Lijin and Zhanhua to inspect the current state of cultivation and the division of the area. After staying in Lijin for a week, Zhen came to Jinan with Zhao Mingyuan the day before yesterday. Yesterday, they went to the Provincial Government and the Construction Department to report on the progress of their work and seek instructions. Except for Zhao Mingyuan, who immediately returned to Lijin, Zhen is temporarily staying in Jinan to handle official business. According to Zhen, on this trip to Lijin for inspection, he passed through Machang, Luo Jia, Mian Tiao Gou, and the old reclamation area. He also inspected the estuary with Commander Zhao. Regarding the relocation and reclamation matters, there are a total of 900 households and more than 4,100 people in Machang, who have been allocated more than 270 qing of land. The existing reclamation households have been allocated more than 70 qing of land. Now, villages are being established, and land is being divided and seeds distributed. Sorghum has already been sown. Near Luo Jia, Mian Tiao Gou, and Da Wa, new villages are being established for more than 1,100 people, with 500 people in each village. Land is also being allocated and sorghum planted. Each old tenant household is given 20 mu of land. As for the old reclamation area, there are currently more than 12,000 people, including more than 5,000 able-bodied men, all with their families. Food is distributed daily: one jin for adults, two and a half jin for able-bodied men, and half a jin for children. Another 4,000 dan of bean seeds have been purchased, ready to be transported for consumption and planting. There are currently 5,000 households in the old reclamation area, with a total of 1,500 qing of land. Each person is given 30 qing of land, while the existing tenant households are given more than 70 qing of land. Now that the bean seeds have been transported down, planting will begin immediately. Because this area is bordered by the Yellow River on two sides and the sea on one side, it is necessary to build dams to prevent harm from the Yellow River during the flood season. The office has allocated a portion of its funds for the construction of a large dam in the old reclamation area. Construction has begun, and the south dam has already been completed. The north dam is also under active construction. Regarding the situation at the estuary, since the Yellow River changed its course last year, it is still divided into two streams. One stream is the new channel in the north, while the old channel is in the south. However, recently, the old channel has become heavily silted, and the new channel has become winding to the north. When I inspected with Commander Zhao, it was during high tide, and the water depth was only up to the knees. After the tide receded, the water was only three or four inches deep. The riverbed is all yellow mud, and the siltation is too high, so the water flow is not smooth. This should not be ignored. If the estuary is dredged to allow smooth water flow, the dangerous areas will be reduced. Not only will the entire Yellow River benefit in the future, but the reclamation area in Lijin will also be safe.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Disaster Victim Relocation and Reclamation Office has already relocated more than 10,000 people to the Lijin area. The other day, the Provincial Government received a report from Liang Zhonghua, the Special Commissioner of the First Administrative District, stating that there are still more than 12,000 disaster victims in the Dongping area who are seeking relocation to Lijin. After receiving the report, the Provincial Government instructed the Disaster Victim Relocation and Reclamation Office to review and discuss it. After receiving the order, the office found that there are still areas north of Yancun in Lijin up to Yihezhuang where a dozen villages can be established, accommodating more than 2,000 disaster victim households. A factual report was submitted to the Provincial Government. At the same time, due to the continued relocation of immigrants, an additional appropriation of more than 300,000 yuan is required, and the Provincial Government is also requested to find ways to raise these funds.

<h3 id="e81">The Yellow River: The Opening and Chen Flood Seasons Are Worrying; River Bureau Plans to Raise and Strengthen Dikes and Embankments <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Kaifeng Dispatch: Chen Yunshu, the River Affairs Bureau's inspection director, recently returned from inspecting the lower northern areas. According to him, during the opening and Chen flood seasons, the water level inside the dikes is more than 2 zhang higher than the land outside the dikes. From the Nineteenth Fort of the Kaifeng Northern Flood Section to the Third Fort Embankment of the Chen Northern Flood Section, the embankments are constantly facing the river, and all the embankments are generally short and low. During last year's heavy floods, many of the embankments were submerged, some level with the water surface, or one or two decimeters above the water surface. This spring, there has been heavy snowfall outside Jialueguan in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, unseen in decades. The water source is bound to be even greater than last year. The Dongzhuang breach has caused heavy siltation downstream. This year's closure will prevent the tail end from draining smoothly. During this year's autumn floods, the water level is bound to rise exceptionally high. The embankments will inevitably be submerged even more. The soil at the core of the embankments will inevitably be soaked and washed away by the floodwaters. If the embankments collapse, the dikes will lose their protection. The dike material is mostly sand, which is difficult to withstand floodwaters, and the danger is alarming. It seems that raising and strengthening the embankments is essential to withstand the raging torrents. Last May, the responsible sub-bureau submitted a request for repairs, estimating a need for more than 600,000 yuan, but it could not be accomplished. This year, the dangerous situation is even more severe than in previous years, and it is necessary to handle the matter carefully, balancing funds and construction. It is estimated that from the Nineteenth Fort Fourth Embankment of the Kaifeng Northern Flood Section to the Third Fort Embankment of the Chen Northern Flood Section, a total of 7,139 cubic meters of earth and 18,563 cubic meters of stone are needed. Gucheng Village in the Chen Northern Flood Section was originally located south of the Chenqiao Dike, with a beach more than ten li wide. Later, due to the northward movement of the Yellow River, the riverbank collapsed into residential houses, and residents moved north. The remaining beach became smaller each day, and the distance to the dike became extremely close. Chen, the former director, held the view that protecting the dike was not as good as protecting the embankment, and protecting the embankment was not as good as protecting the beach. He purchased stone to build a section of beach protection, consisting of two stone dams, five stone spurs, and six stone cliffs, with a length of more than 170 zhang. Due to years of neglect, most of it is dilapidated. Considering the northward movement of the river and the potential for flooding this year, repairs are necessary. It is planned to utilize the existing old stones on the beach and estimate the cost of repairs.</p>

<p>Shi Ding, a farmer's widow from the fourth jia of the sixth bao of the Xijia Bang in the Chuodun Township in the seventh district of this county, has been widowed for several years, but has accumulated considerable savings, which has attracted the attention of bandits. At about 12 o'clock on the night of the 15th of this month, more than 40 bandits suddenly came, breaking into Shi's house with guns. The widow, who was in the middle of a dream, got up when she heard the alarm, and was immediately seized by the bandits and forced to reveal the location of her hidden silver. The widow pleaded bitterly, saying that she had no savings. The bandits, without asking any questions, stripped the widow of all her clothes, leaving her completely naked, and then tied her up with rope. They then used kerosene to set fire to her armpits, breasts, abdomen, and other parts. The widow screamed in agony and had no choice but to reveal the location of her hidden silver. Two vats of silver dollars, estimated to be worth 1,600 yuan, as well as countless clothes, bedding, contracts, and food, were robbed. Afterwards, the case was reported to the local Public Security Bureau for strict investigation, but the bandits had already fled far away.</p>

<p>Yuan Junli's wealthy household at No. 37 Daxinqiao Lane inside Loumen was suddenly visited by three bandits at around 6 p.m. on the 16th. The maid Chen Ma opened the door and let them in. Yuan Junli and others were driven to the inner room, and the search and robbery began. It lasted for three hours before they left with the stolen goods, causing a loss of more than a thousand yuan. Afterwards, the victim reported the case to the local police precinct, who in turn reported it to the Public Security Bureau. Inspector Tian Yan immediately ordered the detective team to strictly apprehend the fleeing thieves. However, since Chen Ma was suspected of colluding with the bandits, she was immediately detained. Later, at midnight, the principal offenders Gan Jinshan (aka Chen A'er), Wang Fengshan, and Ma Youfeng were successively intercepted at the Pingmen Railway Station and other places. The stolen goods, including legal tender and silver dollars, were found. They were immediately taken back to the station for interrogation. According to the suspects, the mastermind was Wang Jinshan. Subsequently, Gao Songshan, who was dividing the spoils on the spot, and several other suspects were arrested. The detective team is currently investigating the case.</p>

<p>The Nantong County Government recently investigated and found that the outstanding land tax owed by the people over the years totals 2,319,008 yuan. A collection committee has been formed to collect it by the end of September this year. Those who have land but no grain and those who have grain but no land (approximately more than 400,000 mu) will have their taxes offset after a reassessment. Those whose family property has declined and are unable to pay will be ordered to register. After verification, they will be allowed to pay when they have the funds in the future.</p>

<p>Gu Honghong, who runs a tofu shop in Xiaojialangxia, is over 40 years old. His wife is of similar age. They first started on Hedong Street and moved to No. 13 Xiaojialangxia last year, where their business flourished. In addition to the couple's hard work, they also hired a fellow worker named Zhu Haoxing. Unexpectedly, Zhu soon became involved with the shop owner's wife. When Gu Honghong found out, he dismissed Zhu. However, the adulterous wife's affair continued secretly. Eventually, the wife planned to murder her husband so that she could be with him permanently. Zhu initially refused, but was eventually seduced. On the night of the 16th, Zhu hid nearby. When the morning was still dark, the wife got up first, while Gu was still fast asleep. The wife first led her lover Zhu Haoxing in, and they worked together. Their weapon was a large bag of quicklime, which they violently covered Gu's head and face with, while also strangling his neck. Fortunately, Gu was lying on his side, and his neck was not strangled, so he was able to resist. However, he coughed and choked incessantly, spitting up blood, and his eyes were blinded. After a desperate struggle, he managed to run out naked and call for help. The neighbors heard the noise and got up, running to the Public Security Precinct to report. The female murderer was arrested, and Gu Honghong was sent to the hospital for treatment, while the male murderer escaped. Yesterday afternoon, she was sent to the county court for trial.</p>

<p>After labor and management agreed on a salt price of 8 jiao per dan for this year in Yaochang, the salt merchants have not yet started purchasing, causing the salt workers to accumulate salt and experience a panic in their livelihoods. Yesterday, salt worker representatives from the entire district, Shen Chengzhao, Yuan Gongqi, and others, gathered more than 300 salt workers and district directors at the Baogong Temple in Andong to hold a meeting. It was decided to send representatives to petition the district government, demanding that the factories be ordered to start purchasing and that the 60,000 yuan in unpaid salt wages be paid to maintain the people's livelihood. District Head Zuo Jinghong accepted their request and promised to order the merchants to comply.</p>

<p>Although the opium prohibition in this county has been extremely strict in recent months, with dozens of opium offenders arrested in each district and sent to the county every day, the habit is deeply ingrained. Addicts continue to smoke, and traffickers continue to sell. A few days ago, a female guard in the women's prison, Wu Shen, suddenly had a strange idea and privately stored two opium pipes and some opium paste, supplying the female opium addicts to smoke in shifts. The prison guard discovered this and found the items in the prison. The human and material evidence was presented to the county, and the court sentenced the civil servant Wu Shen to one year and ten months in prison. The night before last, someone secretly reported to the county magistrate that people were smoking opium in the county's opium rehabilitation center. He went to knock on the door at 2 a.m., entered, and searched, detecting a strong smell of opium. The opium addicts were unable to hide in time, and several opium pipes, opium paste, and scoops were found. Opium was also found on Li Zhanglin, who was undergoing compulsory rehabilitation, and opium paste was found on two others, A and B. They were taken back to the station that night and arrested. These two major opium cases were exposed in a matter of days, and both involved civil servants committing malfeasance, which caused astonishment among the people.</p>

<p>The Wudi Brand Tooth Powder produced by the Shanghai Family Industry Society has recently been counterfeited by unscrupulous merchants who are deceiving the public. At 10 a.m. on the 28th of last month, the train inspection station of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters seized a large box of counterfeit trademarks at the railway station. In addition to a large number of counterfeit Wudi Brand Tooth Powder trademarks, there were also counterfeit Koukou Dan, Ruyi Oil, and counterfeit Ren Dan trademarks produced by the Sino-French Pharmacy.</p>
<p>The goods were brought on board at Dazhimen, intended to be transported to Xuchang and Yuzhou in Henan for manufacturing and sale. Only the principal offender Wang Guangshan was apprehended on the spot. The inspection station immediately notified the Hankou branch of the society to go to the police station to identify the counterfeit goods and arrested the suspect. The suspect was briefly interrogated and then handed over to the General Bureau. After repeated questioning, he confessed to the counterfeiting. The printing shop that printed the counterfeit trademarks was also tracked down. The police were dispatched to escort Wang Baoshan to identify Li Yuting, the owner of the Risheng Lithographic Printing Shop at Qinglong Street in Hankou's Shengping Street, and arrest him. The case and the suspects were transferred to the local court the day before yesterday. After an investigation by Prosecutor Tang Shouren, the case was transferred to the Criminal Court for public trial.</p>

The Anhui Provincial Government has repeatedly ordered the Public Security Bureau to strictly prohibit this to protect the rural areas. On the 14th, the bureau seized 34 plow cattle being transported out of the province by Xiexing Cattle Business. The vehicle and the eight escorts, including Hua Zhanyuan, were detained for investigation.</p>

<p>A man named Yang Youru, also known as Yang Youru, claiming to be a counselor of a certain military headquarters in the Northwest, falsely claimed to be acting on the orders of a certain Central Committee member to campaign for the National Assembly election. He traveled from Nanjing to Wuhe, where he sought out Yang Bianfu, a former county party committee member whom he did not know, and asked for his assistance in the campaign. He also arranged to meet in Bengbu for further discussions. After arriving in Bengbu, he hired a servant for errands. Before long, Yang Bianfu received a telegram from Nanjing, instructing him to forward it to Yang Youru and arranging for him to go to Nanjing. The telegram was signed by a certain Central Committee member. After Yang Youru arrived in Bengbu, he sent a letter urging Yang Bianfu to come to Bengbu. Yang Bianfu believed the telegram from the Central Committee member and had no suspicions. So, he traveled from Wuhe to Bengbu to meet with Yang Youru. They had a pleasant conversation. Yang Youru opened a room on the first floor of the Dongya Hotel, purchased two bottles of orange juice and almond syrup, and instructed his servant to serve the almond syrup to Yang Bianfu if he came to visit while he was out. On the morning of the 14th, Yang Bianfu went to visit, but Yang Youru was not in his residence. The servant served him the almond syrup. Bianfu and Youru's servant both tasted it, and immediately felt numbness. They both collapsed unconscious. A hotel employee discovered them and reported to the police, who transported Yang Bianfu and Yang Youru's servant to Pujing Hospital. After examination, the doctor diagnosed them with poisoning. The Public Security Bureau immediately sent police to arrest Yang Youru, but he had already fled. After medical treatment, Yang and others gradually regained consciousness in the evening and are no longer in danger of death.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Attending the British Art Exhibition: Ancient Artifacts Arrive Safely Yesterday; 91 Crates Containing 1,022 Pieces; Zheng Tianxi Speaks of the Supreme Honor Received in England; Public Exhibition at the Examination Yuan on June 1st <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The 1,022 ancient artifacts from our country's participation in the British London International Art Exhibition, packed in 91 crates, arrived safely in Shanghai yesterday morning aboard the British Steamship Company's "Rampurra." The National Government's special commissioner, Zheng Tianxi, along with secretaries Tang Xifen and Zhuang Shangyan, accompanied the shipment to oversee its transport. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai This Morning Under Police Protection</p>
<p>The "Rampurra" docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf at 6:30 AM. Those present to welcome and assist included Lei Zhen, Director of the Ministry of Education; Ma Heng, Director of the Palace Museum; Guo Lianfeng; Yu Dehui; Shu Chushi; Ouyang Banghua; and over twenty family members of Zheng Tianxi. The Water Police Bureau and the Public Concession Police Department both dispatched large numbers of officers to the scene for protection.</p>
<p>Arriving at the North Station, Heading to Beijing This Morning</p>
<p>All of the ancient artifacts, except for ten crates due to their large size which were placed in the baggage hold, were stored in the vault. As per regulations, the mail had to be unloaded first before any other items could be unloaded. Therefore, the unloading of the artifacts began at 9:00 AM and were transported to the North Station by China Travel Service baggage cars. Plainclothes detectives in cars followed along the route for escort. In the North Station area, the Municipal Police Bureau dispatched a large contingent of police officers to guard and protect the artifacts. This train carrying the artifacts will depart for Beijing this morning.</p>
<p>Zheng Tianxi Discusses the Exhibition</p>
<p>According to Dr. Zheng Tianxi, speaking to a Central News Agency reporter, this London Chinese Art Exhibition focused on the exhibits from our country. Fifteen countries selected exhibits, totaling 3,080 items. The exhibition ran for fourteen weeks, from November 28th of last year to March 7th of this year, with over 420,000 visitors, averaging over 5,000 per day. In the final weeks, the crowds became even more dense, reaching 20,000 visitors in a single day, unprecedented in the history of London's international art exhibitions. Had it not been for the mourning period for the late British King George V, the number of visitors would have been even greater. The public opinion of Britain and other European countries greatly praised the exhibition. Scholars subsequently wrote articles and gave lectures, promoting Chinese art and culture. Mr. Ormsby-Gore, the British Minister of Public Works and a renowned art critic, stated at a British government banquet for the Art Exhibition Preparatory Committee that this exhibition displayed the soul of the Chinese nation. The Times reiterated this sentiment in its editorial. General reviews expressed great admiration for the craftsmanship of ancient bronzes. I also frequently responded to requests to lecture on Chinese culture, promoting the spirit of benevolence, morality, justice, and peace. I deeply believe that Europeans' general perception of China will be further improved as a result. The round trip of our country's exhibition items was assisted by the British government. After the exhibition closed, Mr. Fu Zhenlun, an assistant sent by the Palace Museum, packed the items. With the consent of our government, the exhibits returned to China aboard the British mail ship "Rampurra," escorted by British warships in stages. On April 8th, the artifacts were loaded onto the ship and stored in a specific warehouse, sealed with additional stamps. The ship sailed on the 9th, with secretaries Tang and Zhuang accompanying the shipment. I boarded the ship on the 17th in Marseille, France. We encountered severe storms and anchored at the port of Gibraltar. The ship was then blown aground on a sandbar by the wind. During the storms and grounding, Secretaries Tang and Zhuang repeatedly went down into the hold to inspect the crates, confirming that they were all safe. Upon hearing the news in London, I immediately consulted with Ambassador Guo in Britain and contacted both the British Foreign Office and the shipping company, while also sending a telegram to Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education reporting the situation. Subsequently, the captain and others planned, and with the assistance of the British Admiralty in Gibraltar, 3,000 tons of cargo and fuel oil were unloaded from the ship. At the same time, the tide rose, the wind calmed, and a naval tugboat was dispatched to assist. The inner and outer hulls of the ship were immediately inspected and found to be undamaged. The ship then continued its voyage. After boarding the ship in Marseille, I, along with Secretaries Tang and Zhuang, continued to inspect the crates in the hold and reported to Minister Wang at all times. The ship was aground for sixty hours but ultimately emerged safely. The exhibits arrived in Shanghai on schedule, without any damage, which is truly fortunate. The detailed circumstances before and after will be provided in a separate report to be submitted to the Executive Yuan in the near future.</p>
<p>Tang Xifen Discusses the Grounding Incident</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng boarded the ship in Marseille. When the "Rampurra" ran aground outside the port of Gibraltar, only Tang Xifen and Zhuang Shangyan were on board to oversee the ancient artifacts. Mr. Tang gave a very detailed account of the grounding, stating that on April 13th, the ship encountered severe storms near the coast of Portugal. By noon on the 14th, when it reached Gibraltar, the winds became even stronger, so the ship dropped anchor, intending to continue the voyage after the storm passed. At this time, a southwest wind was blowing, and the "Rampurra," with its high hull, was gradually pushed onto the beach without anyone noticing. Only the bow of the ship was aground, while the stern could still move. However, reefs were discovered just a hundred feet away, causing considerable concern. On the 15th, the wind speed reached 70 miles per hour, making it impossible for the second batch of passengers to board the connecting ship, as the connecting ship could not approach. That night, the British Admiralty of Gibraltar dispatched two tugboats to pull the ship off the ground, but the chains broke, and the ship remained stationary. At this time, I received many wireless telegrams from various parties, such as Minister Wang Shijie of the Ministry of Education in Nanjing, Ambassador Guo Taiqi in London, and major newspapers, all inquiring about the safety of the ancient artifacts. I immediately accompanied the captain into the hold to inspect and found no leaks. I then replied that there was no cause for concern. However, I agreed with the captain that in case of danger, the ancient artifacts would be moved first. On the 16th, after unloading 2,000 tons of fuel oil and 1,000 tons of cargo, the ship became lighter. By 10:00 PM on the 16th, it floated and escaped danger. On the 17th, a Danish salvage ship passed by, and two divers from the ship were asked to inspect the bottom of the ship, reporting that there was no damage. The voyage then continued. On the 19th, the ship arrived in Marseille, where Mr. Zheng Tianxi boarded the ship. Together with the local Chinese consul, he inspected the ancient artifacts in the hold and was relieved to find them safe and sound.</p>
<p>British Warships Escorted the Ship in Stages</p>
<p>Mr. Tang also stated that because the British government was transporting our country's priceless works of art back home on the "Rampurra," they dispatched warships in stages to ensure the safety of the ship along the way. From London to Gibraltar, the destroyer "Scott" provided escort. From Gibraltar to Malta, it was the destroyer "Fortun." From Malta to Port Said, it was the destroyer "Forester." From Port Said to Aden, another destroyer was used. From Colombo to Shanghai, the cruiser "Dauntless" provided escort. During the voyage, the warships remained only two to three hundred feet away from the "Rampurra." Upon arriving at each port, a squad of sailors was sent aboard to provide protection. Only on the stretch from Aden to Colombo was there no warship escort.</p>
<p>Our Country's Ancient Artifacts Scattered Abroad</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter inquired of Mr. Zhuang Shangyan about the ancient Chinese artifacts exhibited by other countries. According to him, Britain had the largest quantity, and the best items were jade, bronze, and porcelain. Outstanding items included the thirteen bronze "jin" (tables) formerly in the collection of Duanfang and jade items such as a large jade cong and knife.</p>
<p>Considerable Revenue from Ticket Sales</p>
<p>The exhibition ran from November 28th of last year to March 7th of this year. It was open from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM daily, except for Sundays, the Winter Solstice, and two days for the funeral of the British King. Admission tickets were priced at one shilling and sixpence for regular admission (half price for students), but five shillings on Fridays. Season tickets were 21 shillings, and group tickets were one shilling per person. Ticket sales totaled 45,000 pounds. Distinguished guests who attended included the British King and Queen, the Kings and Queens of Romania, Norway, and Denmark, and the grandson of German Emperor Wilhelm. People from all over Europe made special trips to visit. Due to restrictions on the export of funds from Germany, travelers could not take large sums of money abroad, so three to four hundred people chartered a ship to England, eating and lodging on board to save money. Over twenty members of the Chinese Art Association in France and students from the Netherlands (Dutch Overseas Chinese) also made special trips to visit. Reviews from various newspapers were uniformly complimentary. Experts praised our country's bronzes, noting that they were more complex than those of other countries. They described the paintings and calligraphy as "very special," and many discussed the "perspective" of Chinese paintings, leading to the publication of a book specifically discussing "The Perspective of Chinese Painting."</p>
<p>Lei and Pan Hosted a Welcome Dinner for Zheng and Others Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday evening at 7:00 PM, Lei Zhen and Pan Gongzhan hosted a dinner at the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road to welcome Commissioner Zheng Tianxi and Secretaries Tang Xifen and Zhuang Shangyan. In addition to Zheng, Tang, and Zhuang, those in attendance included Yang Hu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison; Cai Jingjun, Director of the Municipal Police Bureau; Li Dachao; Zhao Tiezhang; He Dekui; Guo Lianfeng; Yu Dehui; and over ten members of the press, including Zai Boqi, Hu Zhengzhi, Li Haoran, Li Zikuan, and Zhang Changren. Lei delivered a welcome speech and expressed gratitude for the assistance provided by various parties before and after the artifacts were sent abroad. Commissioner Zheng delivered a thank-you speech and reported on the exhibition abroad. He Dekui also gave a short speech. The gathering ended on a joyful note at 9:00 PM.</p>
<p>Zheng Left Shanghai for Beijing Last Night</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng left Shanghai for Beijing by train last night. The special train carrying the ancient artifacts will depart this morning. Secretaries Tang and Zhuang will also travel to Beijing within the next few days. After all the ancient artifacts arrive in Beijing, they will be temporarily stored in the basement of the Examination Yuan and will soon be put on display in the Yuan. There will be two exhibition rooms for paintings and calligraphy, one for bronzes and jades, and one for porcelain. The glass display cabinets have already been arranged, and the opening is scheduled for June 1st. Admission tickets will be priced at 50 cents in national currency and one yuan on Sundays.</p>

<p>Words from the Group Leader</p>
<p>Most of the group members are from Fujian, with the remainder from Guangdong. Because they have been abroad for so long, most of them are not fluent in the native language. According to Group Leader Pan Kaixing and Deputy Group Leader Ke Shitain, speaking on the ship, the members of this group have returned to the country for sightseeing, to observe the progress of national construction in recent years, and to visit relatives.

When they arrived in Guangdong, they visited the Tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs at Huanghuagang. They plan to travel extensively to Shanghai, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Wuxi, Beijing, Jinan, Qingdao, Tianjin, and Pinghan, staying for two months before returning to Surabaya. Mr. Pan and Mr. Ke declined to comment on the treatment of overseas Chinese by the authorities in Surabaya, as if they had something difficult to say, and their inner pain was already self-evident.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Receptions</p>
<p>The group visited the city center and Wusong yesterday afternoon, paying their respects at the sites of the Battle of Shanghai.

<h3 id="e103">Order from the Ministry of Finance: Amendments to the Regulations on the Management of Silver Products; The Silver Content of Silver Products Will Still Be Handled According to Existing Practices <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued an order last night announcing amendments to the Regulations on the Management of Silver Content in Silver Products, stating that since the implementation of legal tender on November 4th of last year, the Ministry had promulgated twelve articles of the Regulations on the Management of Silver Content in Silver Products on the 15th of the same month. Article 2 of the regulations stipulates that from the date of promulgation of these regulations, all silver utensils and silver ornaments should be made with chemical silver as the raw material, and if pure silver must be added, the content of pure silver should not exceed 30%. This was originally intended to save silver and prevent the smuggling of silver products. Subsequently, chambers of commerce in various provinces and cities and the National Silver Trade Association requested amendments one after another. The Ministry then ordered the Central Mint to prepare a variety of alloys in accordance with the 30% limit on silver content stipulated in the regulations, and ordered silver product manufacturers to purchase and test them. If there were indeed difficulties, the Ministry would consider further amendments. Now, according to reports from chambers of commerce in various provinces and cities and silver trade associations, the aforementioned alloys are not suitable for handicraft manufacturing, which affects the livelihoods of millions of workers. They have requested that the previous case be amended. After review by the Ministry, the situation is factual. Since silver management is now strict, in order to take into account the livelihood of silver shop workers and preserve our country's inherent craftsmanship, it is approved to amend the phrase "silver content shall not exceed 30%" in Article 2 of the regulations to "still be handled according to existing practices." Also, the phrase "30%" in Article 6 of the regulations and the phrase "but those who apply for special approval from the Ministry of Finance shall not be subject to the 30% restriction in Article 2 and Article 6" in Article 11 are all deleted. In addition to separate orders, this order is issued.</p>

Tomorrow, he will join Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, Fu Bingchang, and others to take the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Empress of Canada" to Hong Kong and then to Guangdong to represent the Central Government in paying respects to Chairman Hu and assisting with the funeral arrangements. Li Xiangen, specially sent by the Southwest to report on Chairman Hu's funeral arrangements, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today. The news about Chairman Hu's funeral arrangements obtained here is recorded below:</p>
<p>Those Offering Condolences: Yesterday, many people went to the Shanghai office of Chairman Hu's Funeral Committee to offer condolences, including Zheng Daxie, former Deputy Minister of Judicial Administration, and Xu Xiuzhi, former Deputy Minister of the Interior. In addition, Wang Boqun, a member of the Central Committee, and Cai Jingjun, Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, also sent wreaths.</p>
<p>Preparing for Public Memorial Service: The Preparatory Committee for the Public Memorial Service for Chairman Hu by all sectors of the city is scheduled to hold its first preparatory meeting at the YMCA at the Eight Immortals Bridge at 2:00 PM today to discuss matters related to the public memorial service. Yesterday, the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government jointly issued a notice stating: "Dear Sir/Madam, in light of the passing of Mr. Hu Zhantang, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee, in Guangdong, the nation is deeply saddened. We are convening representatives from all sectors to discuss the matter of the public memorial service at the YMCA at the Eight Immortals Bridge at 2:00 PM on May 18th.

<p>Letter to the Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun: The Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, a Japanese-language newspaper in this port, sent a letter to the office yesterday, expressing deep condolences on the death of Chairman Hu in Guangdong and requesting publication of Chairman Hu's obituary. The office replied, "Dear Sir/Madam, we have received your letter with respect. The unfortunate passing of Chairman Hu, a meritorious servant of our country, has shocked the world and grieved the nation. Various circles in Shanghai have planned to hold a public memorial service at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for three days, May 25th, 26th, and 27th. If members of your esteemed country sympathize and wish to participate, we hope that you will come to the memorial service on those days."</p>
<p>Funeral Couplets and Memorial Poems: Yesterday, the Shanghai office of Chairman Hu's Funeral Committee received many funeral couplets and memorial poems. Zhang Taiyan's funeral couplet reads, "Who in the world knows that the new laws of Wang Anshi, the reincarnation of Jiefu, are fleeting? He should laugh at the foolish Confucian scholars in the underworld." Another reads, "Sad dreams of hometown are blocked by maple forests, I am startled that his noble spirit may follow the shadows and disappear. My lonely feelings still want to pour out, and my intestines are severed. If a breath can be preserved, illness is not shameful. I turn over my short wings and hate that it is difficult to hold back." Yi Da'an's memorial poem, "I am but an ordinary person, and you remember our old friendship. Brother's book title is wet with ink, and the words are painstakingly hammered out. Like Zeng Gong in the Dharma-ending Age, like Meng Jiao in a noble family. After the tears, I pray for peace and comfort, and I will always copy his declining words."</p>
<p>Collection of Condolence Telegrams: To Madam Hu in Guangzhou from the Shanghai office of Chairman Hu's Funeral Committee, "Upon hearing the shocking news of the passing of Chairman Hu Zhantang, the Party has lost its mentor and the country its pillar. We look north with grief and extreme sorrow. We send this telegram to express our condolences and hope for your understanding. From the Songjiang County Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang in Jiangsu Province." "To Chairman Hu's Funeral Committee in Guangzhou, Mr. Zhantang's contributions to the Party and the country are admired by all. In the first year of the Republic of China, he provided much support for the establishment of our school and contributed to border affairs. This time, he returned despite his illness, awaiting the opportunity to display his talents. We were hoping that he would recover soon and lead the masses, but who knew that a star would fall and disappear so suddenly. The Party has lost its pillar and the country has lost its meritorious servant. We look south with grief and extreme sorrow. We respectfully send this telegram to express our condolences. From Huang Jiaben, former Principal of the Mongolian-Tibetan Colonization School, and all colleagues. Respectfully."</p>
<h3 id="e107">Public Security Bureau and Anti-Smoking Association, etc., Held Anti-Drug Publicity This Morning, Teams Organized from Various Districts of the City Set Off, Specially Invited Various Cinemas to Screen Films, Jointly Issued Another Announcement to Smokers <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Municipal Anti-Smoking Committee, and the Jiangsu-Shanghai Anti-Drug Commissioner's Office of the Military Committee, etc., three agencies, have jointly decided to launch a large-scale anti-drug and anti-smoking publicity campaign starting today. The Municipal Public Security Bureau has issued orders to all district branches, police stations, etc., to organize publicity teams to conduct publicity work in their respective jurisdictions, and distribute leaflets from house to house. The Municipal Anti-Smoking Committee and the Commissioner's Office have also organized lecture and persuasion teams to give lectures in main thoroughfares on the meaning of anti-drug efforts and the harm of opium and other drugs, in order to awaken smokers' attention and encourage them to realize the situation as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Screening Films</p>
<p>The Municipal Anti-Smoking Committee plans to screen films showing the harmful effects of opium and drugs on the silver screen, so that citizens throughout the city will be alerted. It has specially invited major theaters such as Southeast, Penglai, Republic, Rongjin, Central, Jincheng, Donghai, Hongkou, and Zhabei to add anti-drug slideshow slogans and select relevant films on anti-drug topics to be screened before each main feature, in order to carry out widespread publicity.</p>
<p>Guidance Registration</p>
<p>This association is assisting the government in thoroughly eliminating smokers. During the reporting and supplementary registration period, in order to facilitate smokers' inquiries about registration procedures, it has specially negotiated to temporarily set up a smoker registration inquiry office at the Mass Education Center on Wenmiao Road, to provide smokers with registration information at any time. The association has dispatched personnel to make arrangements, and it is scheduled to be officially established starting from the 20th.</p>
<p>Announcement to Smokers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Anti-Smoking Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau are jointly issuing another announcement to all smokers in the city, as a final warning. The original text reads: Smokers, the registration and reporting of smokers and the reporting of drug use in this city began on May 10th and will end on August 10th, with a total period of three months. All procedures for self-surrender for drug rehabilitation and supplementary registration for obtaining licenses have already been published in various newspapers. Now, let us talk to our citizens about the meaning of reporting smoker registration and drug use reporting. Since the smoker registration was held in this city last year, only more than 30,000 smokers have been registered in total. Given the density of the population in this city, the number of smokers is certainly more than this. Therefore, since the end of registration at the end of last year, this bureau has discovered a very large number of smokers who have not registered, all of whom have been sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for legal interrogation. Although these smokers are to blame, they are indeed very pitiful. Therefore, in order to show compassion for smokers, reduce crime, and implement the entire anti-smoking plan, the government has specially formulated measures for reporting smoker registration, strictly investigating and reporting, and at the same time giving smokers who have not registered a final opportunity to supplement their registration. The reporting period is only three months, which is very short. We hope that smokers who have not registered will register quickly. Those who are old and deeply addicted and cannot quit immediately can obtain a limited-term smoking cessation license. Those who are young and have mild addictions can also apply for free smoking cessation. If you still hesitate and try to evade, once you are discovered after the reporting deadline, you will still be sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and punished in accordance with the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Crimes Related to Smoking Prohibition, and there will be no leniency. As for the reporting of drug use, the so-called "drugs" refer to potent drugs such as red pills, morphine, cocaine, and heroin. The harm of these potent drugs is even greater than that of smoking opium, so we have the greatest determination to eliminate drugs. We have formulated a two-year prohibition plan, from 1935 to the end of 1936. Now, there is only half a year left before the prohibition deadline, which will pass very quickly. Once we reach 1937, anyone who manufactures, transports, sells, or uses drugs will be sentenced to death in accordance with the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Crimes Related to Drug Prohibition. Even those who use drugs this year will be sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters if they are discovered by this bureau, and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than three years and not more than seven years in accordance with the aforementioned regulations. In order to give drug addicts a final opportunity to confess, those who confess during the implementation of the reporting period will be exempted from punishment. We hope that those in this city who use potent drugs will quickly report to this bureau, and we will immediately transfer you to a temporary drug rehabilitation center or smoking cessation hospital for free rehabilitation. After rehabilitation, you will be released. Those who manufacture, transport, and sell drugs are also urged to change their professions as soon as possible, and not to be greedy for small profits and forget the great harm, and walk into the legal net. This committee and bureau do not hesitate to persuade you earnestly, just to point out a way to survive, help you seek benefits and avoid harm, and gradually get rid of the sea of suffering. At the same time, the government can achieve the goal of completing the work of prohibiting smoking and drugs in stages. Wouldn't it be good for everyone? If you still stubbornly persist in your mistakes and willingly go astray, then don't blame the government for punishing you without teaching you.</p>
<h3 id="e108">New Jiangzhe Cocoons Enter the Market, Manufacturers Set Off to Collect Cocoons, Application Deadline for the Cocoon Collection Loan Syndicate Set, Silk Factories in Shanghai, Wuxi, and Zhejiang Have Prepared to Start Work <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Spring cocoons in Jiangzhe have begun to enter the market, various silk manufacturers and cocoon merchants set off to collect cocoons, the application deadline for the cocoon collection loan syndicate is set, and silk factories in Shanghai, Wuxi, and Zhejiang are preparing to start reeling silk. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Manufacturers Set Off to Collect Cocoons</p>
<p>Spring silkworms in Shaoxing, Haining, and other places in Zhejiang have successively ascended to the clusters, while those in Jiaxing, Pinghu, and other places have entered their major sleep. Silk manufacturers and cocoon merchants who have been registered and qualified by the Zhejiang Sericulture Control Committee to purchase spring cocoons in various parts of Zhejiang Province, have set off from today to make arrangements in Xing and other places, and will start weighing cocoons tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. Jiaxing, Pinghu, and other places have also prepared to set off. Spring silkworms in Wuxi, Liyang, and other places in Jiangsu will also enter their major sleep. Various cocoon shops have set the opening date for weighing cocoons around the 25th.</p>
<p>Loan Application Deadline Set</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Jiangzhe Spring Cocoon Collection Loan Syndicate in 1936, general and branch offices were established in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Wuxi, and the handling of cocoon collection loans began simultaneously. All silk manufacturers and cocoon merchants can apply for loans in accordance with the syndicate's regulations. In order to facilitate applicants, the offices will remain open on Sundays, and applications will be reviewed and approved by the standing committee members of each branch office bank at any time. The deadline for Zhejiang is set for the 20th, and the deadline for Jiangsu is set for the 25th. Although the total amount is set at 30 million yuan, it is unlikely to be fully subscribed in reality.</p>
<p>Silk Factories Prepare to Start Work</p>
<p>In recent years, the foreign trade of Chinese silk has been affected by the dumping of Japanese silk, resulting in a sharp drop in prices and a significant reduction in sales. The price of cocoons has also fallen, affecting the livelihood of farmers. Since the improvement in foreign sales in the autumn of last year, silk prices have rebounded, but due to years of decline, the output of cocoons has decreased. Therefore, silk factories in Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Wuxi are all feeling a shortage of raw materials and are forced to suspend work. Taking Shanghai as an example, only six silk factories, including Fulun, are barely operating. After the new cocoons enter the market, a large number of silk factories in Shanghai, Wuxi, and Zhejiang will start reeling silk.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Reorganization of Civil Aviation Conference, Acting Minister Yu Presided, Held This Morning <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>There are more than 50 private aviation companies in Shanghai, and their business routes cover both the north and south of the Yangtze River. In recent years, freight volume in various places has decreased, coupled with the spread of smuggling. Therefore, very few private aviation companies can maintain profitability. In order to jointly conspire to</p>
<p>Save the Aviation Industry</p>
<p>They have submitted opinions to the Ministry of Communications, requesting that under the supervision of the Ministry of Communications, a plan for the co-existence and prosperity of private aviation companies be sought. This matter was agreed to by Acting Minister Yu Feipeng, who first telegraphed the Shanghai Shipping Association, informing the various private aviation companies in Shanghai that they were allowed to convene a meeting of all private aviation company representatives in Shanghai at 2:00 p.m. on the 16th of this month. The Civil Aviation Reorganization Conference will be personally presided over by Acting Minister Yu, who will come to Shanghai to</p>
<p>Handle Conference Matters</p>
<p>Due to the urgent time frame, various shipping companies were unable to prepare the chairman representative and proposals for the meeting. Acting Minister Yu had already arrived in Shanghai on Friday. Therefore, Yu Qiaqing, chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Association, stated to Minister Yu and requested an extension. Minister Yu agreed to postpone it by two days. On the 16th, the Shanghai Shipping Association convened representatives of private aviation companies to hold a preparatory meeting to exchange ideas. The Ministry issued</p>
<p>Reorganization Outline</p>
<p>There are a total of eight principles, which will be distributed to all executive committee members of various shipping companies and the Shipping Association for research, in order to conduct detailed discussions at the meeting and strive to realize them item by item. Although the eight principles have not been officially announced, the most important one is that the traditional routes are determined by ships. For example, when a shipping company registers a new ship and applies for a certificate, all the routes must be listed in the certificate. Therefore, they can freely navigate anytime and anywhere. Now, in order to maintain the co-existence and prosperity of civil aviation, it is decided to change the method, and the routes will be determined by</p>
<p>Companies</p>
<p>For example, those who specialize in the Yangtze River route shall not operate along the coast, etc. If the civil aviation company's ships are insufficient and need to be increased, new ships must be built, and old and broken ships must not be purchased again. Rewards will be given for building ships. The public sharing system will be improved to ensure that benefits are shared equally. The Ministry will implement supervision of civil aviation business, and it is also stipulated that ships that have already been sailing shall not be allowed by other companies to insert schedules and compete without authorization. The conference is scheduled</p>
<p>To Open Today</p>
<p>At 9:00 a.m., it will be held at the state-owned China Merchants Bureau. All executive committee members of the Municipal Shipping Association, such as Yu Qiaqing, Shen Zhongyi, Chen Ganqing, Wang Bofen, and Yu Shunmao, will attend. Other shipping companies attending include Sanbei, Hongan, Ningxing, Dada, Datong, Zhengji, Zhaoxing, Ningshao, Zhongwei, Minsheng, Zhidong, Beifang, Daxing, etc., totaling dozens of companies. The chairman of the conference is Acting Minister Yu Feipeng. The proposals of various private companies have been drafted yesterday, and the list of representatives has also been submitted to the association, and they are allowed to attend the meeting this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Tea Warehouses and General Sales Office, Cooperation Negotiations Break Down, Zheng Jianyuan Has Sent a Letter Resigning as Director of the Sales Team <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reported that Hong Mengpan and Chen Yizhou, members of the Foreign Tea Trade Association, and Cheng Zhenji, manager of the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Sales Committee General Sales Office, and Zeng Zhen, deputy manager, negotiated cooperation in handling black tea sales. It was decided that the director of the sales team under the General Sales Office should be publicly recommended by the tea warehouses, and Zheng Jianyuan, manager of Yuanfengrun Tea Warehouse, was appointed. As for the specific methods, negotiations continued. Now, because the methods could not be reconciled by both parties, the negotiations broke down, and Zheng Jianyuan has sent a letter resigning as the director of the sales team.</p>
<p>General Office Retains Director, Cheng Zhenji, manager of the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Sales Committee General Sales Office, said to visitors yesterday morning that the principle of cooperating with foreign companies in handling sales had been decided long ago. Yesterday, there were some misunderstandings among the tea warehouses, which led to the failure of reconciliation, which is deeply regrettable. As for the resignation of Sales Director Zheng Jianyuan, a decision has been made to retain him. Foreign companies operating Chinese tea trading houses held a meeting and invited the General Sales Office to send representatives to participate, with the aim of improving Chinese tea manufacturing, etc. It is now scheduled to continue the meeting at 5:00 p.m. on the 18th.</p>
<p>Association Talks About the Process, According to Dong Yucheng, secretary of the Zhuang Tea Trade Association, regarding the dispute over the control of Qihong tea, first, the association received two telegrams from the Anhui Provincial Government relayed by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that it could directly contact the sales office for handling nearby. When the manager and deputy manager of the office came to Shanghai, they were also kindly advised by people concerned about the tea industry to sincerely discuss the matter in order to recover the garden and avoid setbacks in foreign trade. Zheng Jianyuan of Yuanfengrun Tea Warehouse, a fellow trader, had a very close personal relationship with Manager Cheng Zhuxin, and after several rounds of negotiations, a conclusion was reached on the 9th. The solution is that the government should take into account the business debts of the tea warehouses and allow the tea warehouses to be responsible for handling the affairs of the sales team. However, in name, it must show respect to the government, and each tea warehouse will publicly recommend one team leader to be appointed by the manager's office. Then, six warehouses, including Zhongxinchang, which operate black tea, jointly prepared two letters, asking the manager's office to handle the matter and reply to confirm it. The original text of the letter is as follows: Dear Sir, the black tea business operated by our warehouses is fortunate to be considered by your office, allowing us to be responsible for handling the affairs of the sales team, and entrusting us to publicly recommend one team leader for appointment. After investigation, Zheng Jianyuan is experienced and can lead the team. Accordingly, we have prepared a letter of public recommendation, and we hope that you will investigate and handle the matter in order to facilitate the progress. Dear Sir, it has been found that tea shops in the three counties of Qi, Fu, and Zhi have first received loans from our warehouses this year, and then used official loans. The creditor's rights are ambiguous and difficult to avoid conflicts. In order to eliminate doubts, we hereby propose the following conditions, please ask your office to expedite the handling: 1. For tea shops that have completely used warehouse loans, when each box of tea arrives in Shanghai, please send the bill of lading to the tea warehouse that issued the loan, so that the creditor's rights are guaranteed. 2. If the tea shop first receives warehouse loans and then receives official loans, and has not returned the warehouse loans, or has not returned the full amount, the warehouse loan portion should be repaid as soon as possible after each tea shop sells the tea. We firmly believe that your office will be able to abide by the express order of the Provincial Government that does not hinder the warehouse's loan issuance, and approve our request. Accordingly, we have sent the letter, and we hope that you will investigate and reply. It happened to be Sunday, and we had not yet received a reply. Unexpectedly, on the 11th, we read the talks of the manager and deputy manager in a newspaper, and unfortunately, another change occurred. The sales outline that was promised to be published completely wiped out the organization of the tea warehouses, and avoided mentioning it. Compared with the committee's previous proposal to force shop owners to stop their business and become shop employees, the degree of oppression has become even more severe. On the same day, Mr. Zheng handed over three letters from the office, and the appointment letter also included this outline, which was obviously very different from the wording of the letters from each warehouse, which shows that there are unexpected complications. It is clear that there is no sincerity in taking into account the unemployment and debts of the tea warehouses, which is already exposed. The association follows the provisions of the original resolution of the Economic Committee and the telegram to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which has asked Anhui Province to change the handling method, and considers the original intention of appealing and struggling to preserve the business, and absolutely cannot accept it. Mr. Zheng has stated that he has returned all the original documents. Mr. Ling Shumo has been appointed to mediate, but there has been no effect for many days. Yesterday, Mr. Zheng informed us in person that he has prepared a letter to the office to resolutely resign in accordance with the common will of the industry.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Measures for the Transportation and Circulation of Old Single and Double Dime Silver Coins, More Than 300 Coins Should Be Declared and Licensed <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Old single and double dime silver coins are still circulating in the market. The measures for transportation and carrying are something that people in the society urgently want to understand. Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has consulted the Ministry of Finance for verification, and a reply has been received. In order to allow the provincial government to follow the handling, the provincial government ordered each county magistrate to comply. The Shanghai County Government also received the aforementioned order yesterday. The original order and measures of the provincial government are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Provincial Government Order</p>
<p>In accordance with the Ministry of Finance's Document No. 25675, dated April 17, 1936, "In accordance with your Provincial Government's Document No. 157, Finance No. 85, dated April 11, 1936, regarding the presentation by the Wu Jiang County Magistrate on the case of Feng Musheng and others carrying silver coins, how should the detained silver coins and banknotes be returned, please verify and instruct," accordingly, please inquire again and verify the reply. Also, the measures for banning the smuggling of silver coins announced on September 23, 1931, are recorded and sent to the government, so that they can be followed together. Accordingly, a copy of the measures for banning the transportation of silver coins is enclosed and sent to your Provincial Government for referral to the Wu Jiang County Government for reference and handling. In addition to the order, the original attachments are copied and sent to each county magistrate for reference and handling.</p>
<p>Silver Coin Transportation Method</p>
<p>The measures for banning the transportation of silver coins are recorded as follows: When inferior light coins cast by Yi are transported in an attempt to profit from their use, they shall be handled in accordance with these measures when discovered by various checkpoints. Before the implementation of the new currency system law, single silver coins with a total weight of 7.2% in standard Kuping tael, containing 5.04% of pure silver, and double silver coins with a total weight of 1.44 mace, containing 1.08 mace of pure silver, shall be temporarily allowed to circulate according to local customs. Regardless of whether they are single or double silver coins, if they do not meet the aforementioned weight and fineness, they shall be considered inferior light coins. When inferior light coins are discovered, they shall be melted into silver in their entirety. The proceeds from the silver, after deducting handling, melting, and other expenses, shall be 20% for public use. 20% of the public funds shall be used for rewards, and the remaining silver shall be returned to the original transporter for collection. If they are not inferior light coins, regardless of whether they are single or double coins, if the number is within 500 coins, merchants shall be allowed to transport them freely, and the customs shall inspect and release them. If it exceeds 500 coins, a certificate must be obtained from the customs supervision office at the place of departure before they can be transported. In September 24, 1934, the Ministry order revised the 500 coins to 200 coins. When the customs supervision offices issue passports, they should first verify the number, type, and destination of the reported transportation, and fill them in the passport. If the customs discover silver coins being transported without a passport, or silver coins being transported in excess of the passport, except for inferior light coins, which shall be handled in accordance with the aforementioned measures for melting and confiscation, if they are non-inferior light coins, 3% shall be awarded, and the remainder shall be returned.</p>

If the mortgagor does not come to the bureau, the mortgagee can submit the mortgagor's address to the bureau for urging. If the urging is unsuccessful, the mortgagee should still pursue legal action in court, so as not to delay the matter.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Blood Filled the Cabin, a Stench of Rot: Bloodshed on a Sand Barge in the Suzhou Creek. Chen Yujie Rose in the Dead of Night, Wielding a Kitchen Knife. Yang Yuyou Met a Ghastly End, Struck Over Forty Times. The Culprit Disposed of the Corpse in the Huangpu River, Erasing All Traces After the Incident. During the Arrest and Interrogation, the Assailant Seemed to Have a Mental Disorder. <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Chen Jingjie, an Anhui native, owned a sand barge, No. 57920, with a cargo capacity of 400 dan (a unit of dry weight), specializing in freight transport. Recently, he had contracted with the Hu Yumei Sauce Garden Canning Department in Anqing to transport broad bean paste to Shanghai. The barge was moored in the Suzhou Creek near the Zhejiang Road Bridge North Pier, awaiting unloading. The crew consisted of the barge owner, Chen Jingjie, and crew members Chen Xiaodao, Chen Yujie, cook Yang Yuyou, and the barge owner's nephew, Chen Shengqi, totaling five people, all from Lai’an, Anhui. The previous day was the fourth day after the barge arrived in Shanghai, and more than half of the cargo had been unloaded. In the evening, the barge owner, Chen Jingjie, accompanied by crew member Chen Xiaodao, went to the Great World entertainment venue to watch a play. Chen Yujie, Yang Yuyou, and Chen Shengqi remained on the barge and went to sleep first. As was their custom, they all slept naked. Around 11 p.m., Chen Yujie suddenly and secretly rose, holding a kitchen knife. Without explanation, he violently slashed at Yang Yuyou's face. It is estimated that he struck no less than forty times. Yang Yuyou's face and skull were cleaved open, leaving a bloody, pulpy mess. There were two knife wounds on the left side of his neck and one on his right cheek. It is conceivable that Yang must have struggled slightly at the time, but due to the assailant's ferocious momentum and serious injuries, he immediately died. The ghastly act occurred in the sleeping quarters of the barge's stern cabin. Chen Shengqi, who was sleeping with the assailant and the deceased, was startled awake in the darkness. Seizing the opportunity, he rushed out of the cabin naked, shouting for help. Seeing that his crime had been exposed, the assailant actually chased after him, naked and brandishing the knife. At this critical moment, three homeless Shanghai residents, Pan Wenxiong, Ningbo native Chen Caigao, and Nanjing native Wang Liangming (commonly known as wharf bums), happened to come to the barge, intending to spend the night. Seeing that people were coming, the assailant retreated into the cabin, hiding himself, and, out of guilt, threw the corpse out of the right stern window into the Suzhou Creek, intending to eliminate the evidence. Pan and the others caught a glimpse of the horrifying scene and immediately went ashore to report to the Public Concession's Chinese Constables Nos. 1220 and 1228. They boarded the barge to investigate. Under the light of a flashlight, they saw the cabin filled with blood and the assailant curled up inside. At that time, the barge owner and crew member, who had been watching the play, had also returned. They placed the assailant under guard. Meanwhile, the Chinese constables urgently reported to the Hongkou Patrol Division, which dispatched detectives to take the assailant, the murder weapon, the barge owner, the crew member, and the three witnesses to the patrol station for interrogation. They also notified the Customs Water Police, ordering detectives Cheng Yongnian, Hu Changqing, and Xu Lenian to rush to the scene to bring back all the witnesses for questioning. They also hired fishing nets to go to the scene of the incident and retrieve the corpse. Around 4 a.m., they finally retrieved the corpse from the bottom of the water under the Zhejiang Road Bridge and sent it to the Water Police. After daybreak, the Criminal Division interrogated the suspect and witnesses separately. According to the assailant, Chen Yujie, age 40, the motive for the murder stemmed from an incident three days prior when the deceased often fought with him over the quilt, creating animosity. Recently, the deceased had made fun of him, honoring him as the barge owner and insisting on spending money to treat guests, embarrassing him, so he harbored a grudge. Seizing the opportunity when the barge owner and others left the barge, he took the deceased's life. The police officers believed that such a vicious act could not have resulted from mere teasing and arguments and that there must have been other grudges. After rigorous questioning, the assailant suddenly started muttering incoherently, claiming that he had not killed anyone. When he regained some clarity, he confessed to the murder and disposal of the body without hesitation. When the detectives offered him a cigarette, he smiled and smoked it greedily, as if he were unaware that he had committed a crime. According to Chen Jingjie and Chen Xiaodao, they were watching a play and did not witness the gruesome scene. Chen Shengqi described the assailant's act of murder in vivid detail. Pan Wenxiong and others testified to the circumstances of discovering the gruesome scene. They took the assailant's fingerprints and, in the afternoon, sent Detective Hu Changqing to escort all the witnesses, along with the murder weapon, to the Local Court for investigation. Meanwhile, the corpse was transported to the Life-Saving Bureau, and the court was requested to appoint Prosecutor Deng to examine the injuries and instruct the bureau to collect the body for examination. It is reported that the deceased was 52 years old and had been working as a cook on Chen's barge for many years. He had no relatives in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Another report: The Hongkou Patrol Division received a report from a passerby named Pan Wenxiong around 1 a.m. yesterday, claiming that around 12:10 a.m., he was passing by the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and North Suzhou Road when he suddenly saw a child of about ten years old fleeing ashore from barge No. 57920 in the Suzhou Creek, shouting as he ran. Shortly after, he saw a human head being thrown from the barge into the river. He requested that detectives be dispatched immediately to investigate. After receiving the report, the patrol division immediately dispatched detectives, guided by Pan, to rush to the scene. Entering the middle cabin of the barge, they found a man with piercing eyes, covered in blood. The cabin floor was also covered in fresh blood, and the stench was overwhelming. They also found a blood-soaked kitchen knife in the cabin. Other than that, nothing was found. While they were searching, Pan Wenxiong suddenly saw the child still lingering on the shore. He secretly informed the detectives, who went ashore and apprehended him, along with the man in the cabin and Pan Wenxiong. They were all taken back to the patrol station for further interrogation. The man identified himself as Chen Yujie, 50 years old, from Anhui, and admitted to hacking his companion. The victim was his fellow crew member, Yang Yuyou, 52 years old, also from Anhui. When asked why he committed the crime, he gave a vague answer. They then questioned the child, who identified himself as Chen Shengqi, 12 years old, Chen Yujie's nephew. Chen suffered from mental illness, with several episodes a year. This sudden, unprovoked murder of Yang Yuyou was likely due to a relapse, and he was not in control of his actions. He himself witnessed the gruesome scene and was unable to help, so he fled ashore in terror. When asked where the body was hidden, he said that it had been thrown into the river. After obtaining the confession, the patrol captain, noting that the incident occurred outside his jurisdiction, escorted the suspect and the murder weapon to the Lujiazui Water Police Station around 5 a.m. The Water Police Station then dispatched personnel to begin searching in the Suzhou Creek. Around 7 a.m., they finally retrieved the body, which was covered in wounds and almost hacked into three pieces by Chen. The body was transported to the coroner's office for examination. All suspects will be sent to the court for investigation this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Apprentice Falls from Tram, Dies from Head Injuries <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Li Yaokui, an apprentice at the Xingli Machinery Factory in Nanshi, was 18 years old. Around 5 p.m. the day before yesterday, Li rode his bicycle to Zhonghua Road. Seeing a Chinese-owned tram approaching, Li grabbed onto the back of the tram and rode along with it. Unexpectedly, a car came from behind. Li loosened his grip and accidentally lost his balance, falling from the tram and injuring his head. Nearby police officers arrived and rushed the injured man to the hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died around 7 a.m. yesterday. The police station in charge has taken Zhou Jucai, the driver of the tram, into custody. Due to the involvement of a human life, he has been ordered to be sent to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Continued Hearing of the Case of Hu Ganqing's Concubine Suing for Alimony: Both Plaintiffs and Defendants Appeared in Person, Each Stating Their Reasons, Awaiting Rescheduling for Further Interrogation. <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Hu Ganqing, a shareholder of Fuchang Ginseng Store and Beijing Road Hu Qingyu Hall Pharmacy in Nanshi, Hangzhou, left behind considerable stocks and property after his death in 1929. All were inherited by his son, Hu Ji'an. Now, Hu Ganqing's concubine, Madam Hu Li, has hired a lawyer to sue Hu Ji'an in the First Special Court's Civil Division, demanding a lump-sum payment of alimony of 43,320 yuan and compensation for debts of 10,000 yuan. The Special Court has held two hearings and ordered the plaintiffs and defendants to appear in person for further interrogation. These details have already been reported in this newspaper twice. The day before yesterday morning, Judge Peng Shi presided over another hearing in Civil Court No. 4. Both parties, each accompanied by their lawyers, appeared in court. The plaintiff, Madam Hu Li, stated that she was 42 years old, from Huai'an, and lived with the defendant, Hu Ji'an, in a self-built residence on Guling Road. The defendant paid her a monthly living allowance of 60 yuan and a festival allowance of 200 yuan for each festival. However, the defendant's treatment of his relatives was extremely poor. He only provided one meal a day, and the dinner consisted of only rice, without any dishes, which she had to provide herself. As a result, her own mother and another concubine were unwilling to live with him and preferred to live separately in Hangzhou. The defendant himself spent every day indulging in extravagance, recklessly taking concubines and indulging in excessive desires. He had taken a total of four concubines: De, Shen, Yunxiang, and Chenxiang. He also specialized in speculation and wasted money recklessly. Therefore, she requested the court to order the defendant to pay a lump-sum payment of alimony of 43,320 yuan and compensation for debts of 10,000 yuan. Hu Ji'an refuted, claiming that all the plaintiff's allegations were untrue. He stated that he did not engage in speculative activities and only had a securities firm that he co-owned with a friend, specializing in trading on behalf of clients. He did not speculate himself. As for taking concubines, he claimed that it was untrue. He admitted to frequenting brothels. He currently had only one concubine. After his father passed away in 1929, he had never discriminated against the plaintiff. He argued that no family would only provide one meal a day. He had a capital of 9,000 yuan in the New Licha Western Restaurant, five shares in Fuchang Ginseng Store, one share in Baoda Ginseng Store, five shares in De Yuan Ginseng Company, and several shares in a hardware store and two shares in Hu Qingyu Hall. However, because the businesses he operated were all luxury goods businesses, and given the current economic downturn, the businesses were not doing well and could not be compared to extravagance. He requested that the plaintiff's claims be dismissed. The court adjourned the case and scheduled it for further review.</p>

<p>Since its preparation in November last year, the Shanghai City Museum has been actively collecting exhibits related to cultural industries. The collection is now quite impressive and will soon be opened on a regular basis. Since the museum joined forces with the national architectural community to hold the Chinese Architectural Exhibition, manufacturers and merchants in this city have become keenly aware of the significant effectiveness of display advertisements. They have been requesting to donate all their products to the museum for display. The museum also recognizes that the establishment of a local museum, in addition to demonstrating the progress of national culture and enhancing public knowledge, has an original obligation to promote domestic manufacturing. This is to enable the Chinese people to understand the state of national industrial and commercial evolution and to facilitate the adoption of domestic goods, as well as to promote the prosperity of Greater Shanghai and the development of industry and commerce, all of which are matters of utmost concern and effort for Mayor Wu. Therefore, despite the limited space in the exhibition hall, the museum has decided to make every effort to increase the display area, add display cases, and meet the demands of manufacturers and merchants in this city by displaying their products as much as possible to create a grand spectacle. In addition to issuing separate regulations and notifying manufacturers and merchants for their reference, the museum has also scheduled a reception for the industrial and commercial circles at the museum in the city center at 1 p.m. on the 20th of this month (Wednesday), with tea and refreshments, to facilitate a tour of the museum's new buildings, new equipment, and display showcase designs. Invitation letters have already been sent out, and a grand occasion is expected. Furthermore, the museum hopes that the raw materials and manufacturing processes of the various manufacturers' products will be accompanied by photographs and detailed explanations to attract attention.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Successful Imitation of Card-Type High Draft Spinning Frame: Banquet for Textile Magnates of This Port the Night Before Last <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Hu Juewen, General Manager of the Tanshhan Road Cooperative Hardware Company, recognizing the precarious state of China's national industry, has been dedicating himself to the machinery industry for years, constantly seeking improvements. Recently, he successfully imitated the card-type high draft spinning frame, which uses leather rollers to control fibers, increasing the output of yarn factories and saving labor, improving quality, and reducing costs. The accuracy of its effectiveness is no less than that of imported products. It has been test-installed on the spinning machines of factories such as Tongyi and Wing On, and the results have been very satisfactory. The night before last, Mr. Hu hosted a banquet at the Yizhi Xiang Restaurant on Fuzhou Road, inviting textile magnates of this port to promote this advantageous domestic machinery for the yarn industry. Those who attended included Mu Ouchu, Chairman of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange; Zhu Gongquan, Director of Xinyu Yarn Factory; Nie Guangyu of the Textile Experiment Institute; Xu Kuanfu; Ren Shangwu; Fu Daoshen; Tao Pingshu; Wang Zisu, Yan Zhongjian, and Fu Mingjiu of the Cotton Industry Control Association; Guo Mingzhang, Engineer of Wing On Yarn Factory; Jiang Keting, Director of Zhentai Yarn Factory; Engineer Huang Yunyan; Zhu Chuqing of the Textile Department of Nantong University; Zhu Wenqi, Chairman of the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association; Zhang Zhusan, Li Hansan, and Liu Chijun of the North China Inspection Group; and Hu Shuchang, Director of the company; Engineer Huang Xige; and Yang Junsan, Director of Sales. During the banquet, Mr. Hu briefly described the importance of the machinery industry and the low cost of domestic machinery, which not only reduces the burden on users but also plugs loopholes and increases national wealth. He also discussed the process of imitating the card-type high draft spinning frame and the fact that yarn factories in Japan have all adopted the card-type high draft spinning frame, resulting in extraordinary results. Mr. Mu then stood up and spoke passionately about the precarious state of China's yarn industry, attributing it to political factors and the squeeze from foreign goods. In this precarious situation, it was commendable that Chinese people were still striving to improve the machinery sector. He recalled that twenty years ago, it was impossible to hire a Chinese engineer in the Chinese yarn industry. Ten years later, state-owned yarn industries were all in the hands of Chinese engineers. Now, they were able to explore principles in the machinery sector, imitate, and invent. Therefore, China's industry had great hope. He hoped that the banking sector would provide real assistance to domestic industries, prioritizing national welfare and not just focusing on the high annual interest rates and debt rights as the goals of investment. After Mr. Mu's speech, Zhu Gongquan, Xu Kuanfu, Wang Zisu, and others also spoke, all saying that the development of machinery was a harbinger of the development of the national industry and hoped that the machinery industry could cooperate with factories in various industries to achieve supervision and mutual assistance. In order to make the yarn industry aware of the effectiveness of this imitation leather roller high draft spinning frame, Mr. Hu of the Cooperative Hardware Company has specially printed a description for those who wish to request it by mail.</p>

<p>Ministry of Transportation Order No. 1750 to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: It has been determined that the passenger wine fees on the company's new Jiangtian steamer have been set at 20% and collected together with the fare. However, recent investigations have revealed that the tea rooms on the steamer are still demanding extra gratuities from passengers of all classes, which is extremely illegal. The captain of the steamer has failed to supervise properly and should be reprimanded. The purser has failed to manage effectively and should be given a major demerit as a minor punishment. You are ordered to strictly prohibit this practice on the steamer. At the same time, verbally notify the Seamen's Union to quickly ban this practice. In the future, if such incidents occur again in these tea rooms, the perpetrators will be dismissed immediately without leniency, in order to eliminate the malpractice and achieve the goal of thorough reform. The captains and pursers of other steamers, such as the Jianghai steamer, and the members of the Jiang steamer inspection team, are also hereby notified to strictly prohibit this practice. This order is issued.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Record of Shanghai Residents Visiting the Weicheng Silk Factory in Jiaxing: Renowned in Foreign Markets for Its Silk Reeling, Silk Weaving, and Silk Fabricating. An Excellent Endeavor of a Domestic Goods Factory for Foreign Trade. <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>As previously reported, the Weicheng Liji Silk Company has bid for the Jiaxing and Yu Jia branches of the Weicheng Company from the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance. The company's preparatory office invited people from all walks of life in Shanghai to visit Jiaxing yesterday (the 17th) on the 8:35 a.m. train. After lunch at Yan Yu Lou, Mr. Zhu Ligeng led them to visit the various departments and explained their functions. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Huge Amount of Silk Cocoons Transported Abroad</p>
<p>Decades ago, the Chinese people did not know how to weave or refine silk cocoons and regarded them as waste, sometimes even using them as fertilizer for farming. Foreign merchants bought them cheaply and exported them overseas, turning them into pure textiles and satins, which they then shipped back to China for sale. This one change saw the annual outflow of more than a thousand yuan in gold. It was not until the Guangxu period of the late Qing Dynasty that the Shanghai Silk Factory in Caojiadu, Shanghai, was established as a Sino-Japanese joint venture. Later, in 1924, Mr. Zhu Jiexiang of Shanghai, recognizing the outflow of economic rights, established the Zhongfu Silk Factory. Over the past ten years, he has worked diligently and achieved considerable success. In addition, there is the silk reeling department of the Weicheng Yujia branch. The only silk industries in China that are wholly owned by Chinese shareholders are Zhongfu and Weicheng.</p>
<p>Silk Reeling and Fabrication Sold to Nanyang</p>
<p>The average price of silk cocoons is about 40 yuan per dan. Five dan of raw materials can be used to make one dan of silk, which can be sold for an average of 400 yuan. The largest markets are India and the Nanyang Islands. The by-product, waste silk, can also be sold overseas.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Factory's Machinery and Equipment</p>
<p>The power boiler and all the machinery in the various departments are of the latest design. The workshops are clean and orderly. From the refining of raw materials to the production of silk, there are no fewer than twenty steps, requiring more than a dozen types of machinery. The raw materials are first boiled and washed with water, then selected and refined by the first machine. The selected and refined materials are then pulled into thin sheets, then rolled into white cotton, and divided into six sections. After the functions of the various machines, they are spun into silk, which is clean, white, strong, and almost indistinguishable from cocoon silk. The fibers are even finer and more uniform.</p>
<p>Factory Buildings are Solid, Spacious, and Imposing</p>
<p>The factory site faces the Yuanhu Lake, with pleasant scenery. The entire factory covers an area of more than sixty acres, divided into three major sections: silk factory, silk reeling factory, and cocoon-making factory (equipped with steam baking ovens). The construction of each section is extremely solid and functional. It is said that when the former Weicheng Company was founded, the land, buildings, and machinery and equipment cost up to 2 million yuan. Now, Liji Company has bid for it for more than 760,000 yuan, specializing in the silk industry. The silk reeling and cocoon-making sections are still planned to be leased. In the future, the factory will be profitable, with a solid foundation, earning glory for the industrial factory, which can be foreseen.</p>

<p>Shanghai County's annual river dredging plan has seen the dredging of ten rivers, large and small, this year. All work was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of April. However, due to continuous rain, it was delayed. After repeated urging by the county government, the work has now been completed. After the county government has inspected and accepted the reports from each district separately, the dams will be dismantled and the water will be released. The county government also believes that river maintenance is as important as river dredging. The newly dredged rivers in the county in recent years urgently need to be maintained to prevent them from being silted up over time. Therefore, it has specially formulated a set of standards and ordered all districts to comply with them.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Approval from the Jiangsu Provincial Government: Jiangsu Bank's Small Loan Measures, a Total of Ten Items <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Jiangsu Bank recently planned to implement small loans for industry and commerce. The measures were previously submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for approval. The detailed content was not yet known. Now it is heard that these measures have been approved by the Provincial Government. The bank is preparing all the procedures and will soon notify all branches to implement them simultaneously. The transcribed details are as follows: Jiangsu Bank's small loan measures for industry and commerce: The bank is providing small industrial and commercial loans to alleviate financial constraints and stimulate economic activity within the province.  Applicants and guarantors for the loan are limited to legitimate industrial and commercial firms in the local area.  When industrial and commercial firms need to borrow money, those in the guild must apply through the guild to the local chamber of commerce for review and certification before being introduced to the bank for a loan. Those not in the guild must first join the guild before applying for a loan. However, whether the loan is granted or not will still be determined by the bank's review.  In order to ensure careful lending, the bank may write to the chamber of commerce to organize a review committee to introduce small industrial and commercial loans. The specific measures will be formulated separately.  In addition to requiring two established industrial and commercial firms to jointly and severally guarantee the loan, borrowers may use movable property as collateral or security. If the movable property cannot be transferred into possession temporarily, the borrower may offer real estate as the primary security and specify the type, quantity, and value of the movable property in a note, and enter into a movable property mortgage or security agreement with the bank. This is limited to goods, stocks, or securities that can be transferred into possession and have a definite real value. The validity of real estate will be based on legally registered documents from local legal authorities.  The maximum loan amount shall not exceed 2,000 national currency units.  The loan term shall not exceed four months. The principal and interest of the loan shall be repaid in installments or in a lump sum at maturity. If special circumstances prevent repayment on time, a legitimate reason may be stated, and the bank may grant an extension, up to a maximum of one month. If the principal and interest cannot be repaid after the extension, the guarantor will be responsible for repayment, or the bank will dispose of the collateral and security. If there is still a shortfall, the guarantor will be fully responsible for repayment and waive the right to protest and prior claim.  The loan interest rate shall be determined according to local conditions.  These loan measures will be circulated by the Provincial Government to all local administrative agencies for assistance as needed. If difficulties arise in disposing of the collateral and requiring the guarantor to repay the loan, the bank may request the local administrative agency to enforce it.  Each industrial and commercial firm is only allowed one loan at a time. A guarantor is also only allowed to guarantee one loan at a time. No multiple guarantees or mutual guarantees are allowed. A second loan may only be taken out after the principal and interest of the first loan have been repaid.  These loan measures will be submitted to the Provincial Government for approval and implementation, and the Provincial Government will separately notify relevant parties for review. The same applies to any amendments.</p>

<h3 id="e134">### Casings of Pigs, Cattle, and Sheep are also Important for Trade with Our Country; Chinese and Foreign Merchants are Manufacturing in Shanghai; Exports are Mostly to the United States and Other Countries <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Casings have recently become a major item in our country's exports, including cattle casings, sheep casings, and pig casings. Among them, pig casings have the best sales. Currently, there are more than a dozen Chinese casing factories in Shanghai, and there are also six foreign casing factories. The following is based on the investigation by the International Trade Bureau:</p>
<p>Establishment of Factories for Manufacturing: The export of casings involves countries such as England, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, and Austria. It currently occupies an important position in our country's export items. The sources include various cities and towns along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways, as well as areas north of the Yangtze River such as Rugao, Taixing, northern Jiangsu, Xuzhou, Bengbu, Anhui, Wuhu, Datong, Jinhua in Zhejiang, and Shaoxing, all of which are major pig casing producing areas. Shanghai's production is also extremely strong. After the end of the European War, foreigners came to our country to set up factories for manufacturing, with Germany and France being the most numerous. There are currently more than a dozen large Chinese and foreign factories in Shanghai. Those belonging to foreign merchants include: Gehe (German) at the end of Gongping Road; Fuhua (German) on Jiayu Road; Xingsheng (German) at the end of Wusong Road; Anli (German) on Baylor Road; and Anli (French) in Pudong, among others. Those belonging to Chinese merchants include: Shanghai Animal Casings Company on Yongxing Road in Zhabei; Guo Shunji on Tanjiachiao in Zhabei; Gongji on Yaojiachiao in Zhabei; Xinhua on Jiaotong Road in Zhabei; Disiwei Road Xin Da; Wu Tong, and more than a dozen others. There are also nearly ten smaller ones, totaling more than twenty factories.</p>
<p>Manufacturing Procedures: The manufacture of casings requires skilled techniques. After receiving the raw casings from the market (before processing, they are called raw casings), they must go through the process of removing the meat (commonly known as scraping the raw casings, removing the meat and preserving the casing. This is the most difficult part of the entire process, because if the force is too light, the meat on the casing will be difficult to completely remove; if the force is too heavy, the casing will be punctured and become waste). Then the casings are sorted (after the casings are cleaned, they are called light casings. They are divided into seven grades, with the diameter of 21 points being one grade, 28 points being the second grade, 30 points being the third grade, 32 points being the fourth grade, 34 points being the fifth grade, 36 points being the sixth grade, and above 36 points being the seventh grade). After this they are measured (after being sorted, the lengths are measured into 13.5 yards per set). Then salt is applied (to remove moisture). Then they are bundled (two sets are combined into a bundle, shaped like a fist). Then they are put into buckets (buckets are made of hemp and wood, holding 2,500 pieces per bucket). At this point, the entire manufacturing process is complete.</p>
<p>Export Market Conditions: The export of casings mostly involves goods with a diameter of 26 to 30 points. Recently, there have been exports of 5th and 6th grade goods. England and France mostly take 4th grade goods, while Germany and Italy take 3rd to 7th grade goods. Foreign firms handling this business in Shanghai include Lulin, Fulaide, Youyu, and Yongyu. As for market conditions, 24 to 26 point pig casings are 51 yuan per dan (approx. 50 kg), 26 to 28 point casings are 50 yuan, 28 to 30 point casings are 47.5 yuan, 30 to 32 point casings are 45.5 yuan, 32 to 34 point casings are 43.5 yuan, and 34 to 36 point casings are 41.5 yuan.</p>

<p>At 1:15 AM yesterday morning (the 17th), a fire suddenly broke out in a thatched hut inhabited by shantytown residents at the Zhongshan Bridge ramp in the Fanwangdu area of western Shanghai. The resident, Ma Da from Jiangbei, had gone to work in another port, and his wife had also taken their children back to their hometown last month to visit relatives. As soon as the neighbors noticed it, the fire had already become fierce and was shooting into the sky. The Shanghai Municipal Security Team's Second Company stationed on Zhongshan Road mobilized all personnel to try to put out the fire with water, preventing it from spreading. The Caojiadu Fire Brigade, upon hearing the news, rushed to the scene and worked hard to extinguish the fire, which was quickly put out. The fire lasted for more than ten minutes, burning down two thatched huts, with only minor losses. However, the Toyota Yarn Factory, which was located nearby, was severely spooked. Because the resident Ma Da was not at home, none of the items inside could be salvaged. All his belongings were reduced to ashes, which is quite tragic.</p>

<p>According to Dagongshe, since the establishment of the Shanghai Fish Market by the Ministry of Industry, efforts have been made to relieve fisheries, to make their production scientific and their consumption rational, in order to develop our country's fisheries economy and improve the lives of fish merchants and fishermen. During this period, the situation of our country's fisheries must be what all parties urgently need to know. Yesterday, inquiries were made to the fisheries industry about the general situation of our country's fisheries. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Statistics on the Area of Coastal Fishing Grounds</p>

<h3 id="e154">International Triangular Sports Meet: Russian Kaczan Breaks Far East Record in Shot Put: A Score of 12.98 Meters, A Fruitful Harvest; The Russian Community Wins This Year's Championship, Bai Hong Takes Second Place <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>This year's annual Bai Hong, Japanese, and Russian Triangular Track and Field Meet was held at the same day at the Tongwen College on Shiqiao Road yesterday afternoon. The first championship of this competition was won by Bai Hong. The last competition was retained by the Japanese. This year, the three sides had equal strength, and the competition was extremely fierce. Relying on the average talent, the Russian community won this year's championship with 64 points. Due to the absence or injury of the majority of athletes, Bai Hong was unable to play and finished second with 51 points. The Japanese finished fourth with 46 points. The results of yesterday's competition were extremely exciting. In the shot put, the Russian Kaczan broke the tournament record with 12.98 meters, breaking the Far East record of 12.905 meters held by Japanese Abe, which was the most fruitful harvest of the tournament. At the same time, the 1,500 meters, discus, and high jump all broke the tournament's highest record. The full results of yesterday's competition are recorded below.</p>
<p>Full Results</p>
<p>100 Meters</p>
<p>Due to the large number of participants, the preliminary rounds were divided into two groups. In the first group, our side sent the famous player Fu Jincheng, who had just arrived in Shanghai from Malaya. He succeeded in one fell swoop, equaling the tournament record of 11.1 seconds. In the second group, Bai Hong's Ye Songping also sprinted powerfully and took the top spot with 11.7 seconds, but the results were slightly inferior to the first group. In the final, Fu Jincheng took the lead, and Ye Songping closely followed. Russian Kaczan was also in a menacing position, following on the left and right. In the end, Fu Jincheng, relying on his veteran experience, led all the way and broke the white line first. Ye relied on the final violent defender to win the runner-up. The difference between him and the third was only two or three meters, which was also dangerous.</p>
<p>400 Meters</p>
<p>Our main player Zeng Rongzhong was absent, and Wu Zijing, Liao Jinhai, and Chen Mingliang played. After the gun fired, Japanese Miyakawa took the lead. Wu, Liao, and Chen closely followed. After one lap, (300 meters nationwide) the Russian Kaczan sprang out from the middle of the group. At this time, the Russian General Yahetusi also surpassed the rest and ranked third. As a result, General Kaczan overtook the Japanese by one shoulder and rushed to the bottom line first. Bai Hong Wu Zijing also showed courage and surpassed. Yahetusi took third place.</p>
<p>1500 Meters</p>
<p>Because Bai Hong's main player Qiu Zongchen injured his leg and did not play, Xu Yanbo, Gu Huiyuan, and Wan Jinsheng were sent to attend. Japanese Murakami took the initiative, releasing the hawk far away. Chinese generals Gu, Xu, and Wan followed behind. After three laps, there was still no change. By the fourth lap, Xu Yanfu had surpassed Gu Huiyuan, but he was still unable to keep pace with Japanese Murakami. Murakami was able to comfortably reach the finish line. Xu Yanbo was about 30 meters behind. Later, Gu Huiyuan and Wan Jinsheng relied on the final stab to win fourth place.</p>
<p>5000 Meters</p>
<p>The Japanese side was still represented by Murakami. Our side was represented by veterans Chen Xuzhou, Zhou Ruquan, and Wang Rulin, but their strength was inferior. After the start of the race, Japanese Murakami led the way, and Zhou Ruquan and Chen Xuzhou followed behind. The Russian Chechenov was after Huang Rulin. After five laps, the rankings had gradually become clear, but each general had not changed their position. After nine laps, Murakami had abandoned the generals by more than one lap. Our Wang Rulin used all his strength to surpass the two veterans, Zhou and Chen, and moved forward. As a result, Murakami led all the way and reached the finish line first. Wang Rulin was second. The Russian Chechenov caught up with Zhou Ruquan and rose to third.</p>
<p>Shot Put</p>
<p>The Russians were strong. Bai Hong was represented by Quan Yun's athletes Liu Jingfeng, Guan Hongda, and Bao Jiake. After three rounds, the Japanese had all been eliminated. In the fourth throw, Russian Pukofev progressed first. Bian Zhang was second to Pu. Our Liu Jingfeng also made considerable progress. In the fifth throw, Kaczan used his divine power to break the Far East record with 12.98 meters, adding a lot of color to the event. Pukofev still maintained his original position. However, Lai Xiefu surpassed Liu Jingfeng's 12.075 meters with 12.08 meters and advanced to third place. There was no progress in the sixth throw.</p>
<p>Discus</p>
<p>It was still a one-sided situation for the Russian community. Before three rounds, our main player Gu Zhao, etc. were eliminated. The Russian Kaczan was crowned the three armies. Each time he threw, he made progress. Lai Xiefu also relied on his divine power and reached a record of 34.87 meters in the fourth throw, breaking the conference record. Kaczan silently surpassed Lai Xiefu in the fifth throw, becoming 35.53 meters, also breaking the record. There were not many changes in the rest.</p>
<p>Javelin</p>
<p>The javelin was originally a prize for the Japanese and Russians. The Japanese general Kato was impressive and took the lead with 49.20 meters. Later, in the fifth throw, the Russian Sogelin threw vigorously against the wind and reached 49.35 meters, surpassing Kato. Bai Hong's Wang Xuewu and Gu Zhao also had a moving performance at this time. Wang Xuewu was slightly short of 48.40 meters, ranking third. Gu Zhao was behind Wang with 48.38 meters.</p>
<p>High Jump</p>
<p>Jumping is a national skill inherent to the Japanese. Unexpectedly, it was a slump yesterday. When the crossbar was raised to 1.75 meters, Japanese Yuanyun athlete Sawamura and Bai Hong Jiang Huai equally failed. Although Zhou Shizhao, Li Lingzhong, and Lai Xiefu jumped over, when they were added to 1.80 meters, the Russian Pukofev jumped over. Zhou, Li, and Lai could not pass and were listed as second. Pu still increased to 1.85 meters for the trial jump, but due to insufficient strength, he did not pass. According to the results of the four generals Pu, Zhou, Li, and Lai, they all broke the conference record.</p>
<p>Long Jump</p>
<p>The Japanese were represented by the famous player Okubo. Bai Hong was represented by Zhang Shenru, Ye Songping, and Zhu Hongqi. In the first jump, Japanese Okubo scored 6.56 meters. The three generals Ye, Zhang, and Zhu did not step in the right pace, resulting in various results. In the second and third jumps, Zhang Shenru scored 6.40 meters, winning the final. In the fourth jump, Zhang had made great progress, achieving 6.47 meters. As a result, Okubo won the top spot with 6.60 meters. There was no special progress in the remaining two jumps. However, the competition between Zhang Shenru and the Japanese Ito was the most intense.</p>
<p>Triple Jump</p>
<p>Bai Hong Jiang Huai and others gave up temporarily due to leg injuries. Only Zhang Shenru and Huang Jiaxu played. After three jumps, Zhang and Huang were eliminated at the same time. The competitive situation between Japan and Russia was saved. The Russian General Pukuqin Qufu showed his skills in the fifth jump, reaching 13.66 meters, overwhelming Yu Su, and ranking first. The remaining second, third, and fourth places were all taken over by Japanese, and the results were also very close.</p>
<p>Pole Vault</p>
<p>Because Bai Hong's famous player Fu Bao went to Ping to receive training, there was a lack of talent. Zhu Hongqi and Xu Xinqian were selected to resist. Xu did not arrive on time. Zhu was also eliminated in three rounds. Therefore, the competition was between Japan and Russia. When the crossbar reached 3.30 meters, the Japanese generals Takahashi and Oyama failed due to insufficient strength. The top two armies have entered the hands of the Russian community, and the results are still not bad.</p>
<p>400 Relay</p>
<p>Before the game, according to the strength, Bai Hong was the most advantageous. After the game, Bai Hong's first batter Ye Songping started slowly, causing him to fall behind the Japanese in the second batter. Fortunately, Chen Yongfu caught up and surpassed the Japanese and Russians. The third batter of the Japanese and Russian teams fell at the same time due to careless contact. Sun Huipei took the opportunity to catch up. The last batter, Fu Jincheng, was like a hare, and instantly reached the finish line. The second was the Japanese, and the third was the Russian.</p>
<p>1600 Relay</p>
<p>The most competitive and interesting 1,600-meter relay was the finale of the conference. Bai Hong Chen Mingliang first ran 200 meters. Lai sprinted hard and occupied the Japanese two or three meters in the front. In the second bat, Li Houda was late in catching the bat at 400 meters and advanced side by side with the Japanese and Russians. When he reached the third bat, he also led one meter ahead. Qiu Zongchen, who was 800 meters in the third bat, had already led the Japanese and Russians with a relaxed pace after two laps. He was abandoned by 20 meters in the rear. At the end of the bat, Sun Huipei, who was 200 meters, caught up and ran ahead of the Japanese and Russians by 20 to 30 meters. The Japanese won the runner-up, and the Russians won the third place.</p>

<p>— (Drunken Woodcutter)</p>
<p>Red willows green, clear waters and beautiful mountains, a scene of great spring scenery, really enough to intoxicate people, so Dong also initiated the organization of tours, Xi also initiated group travel, as if a precious spring, absolutely must not let it pass lightly! Moreover, "Life must be timely pleasure," has always been the case.</p>
<p>"Spring" is indeed a season praised and encouraged by anyone.</p>
<p>Time flies like a white colt passing through a crack, in a flash, the spring that people are fond of, has quietly followed the fallen flowers and flowing water, silently gone, people lying on the down comforter, what are you thinking about?</p>
<p>"A year's plan lies in spring," now that spring has gone, who can keep spring? Try to reflect on your own plans for the year, have you already established a foundation! -- Friends:</p>
<p>Cherries are red and ripe, sugared plums are on the market, bamboo shoots and broad beans have all been put on the table. After we have eaten our fill, thinking of "Time, oh time, does not come again!" we should also feel a chill down our spines! Don't think that if today passes, there will be tomorrow, and if tomorrow passes, there will be the day after tomorrow; friends: how much youth can a person have in a lifetime!</p>
<h3 id="e182">Plums <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>Gentlemen, ladies, you went to scenic spots to appreciate the peach blossoms for a while, and after a short rest at home, the vendors in the alleys, the poor children, are already squeezing their hoarse throats, calling out "Sugared Plums"! The sound of "Sugared Plums" drills into the ears, and strangely, from the root of the tongue, it provokes a burst of sticky saliva. Cao Mengde marched and lacked water, ordering his soldiers to quench their thirst by looking at plums, I think if in the army, someone shouted three times "Sugared Plums", even in the desert, everyone might still be able to produce fluid on the tip of their tongues.</p>
<p>Green plum flesh, bitter and astringent, is most loved by young women. According to our hometown, the little fingernails on the hands are kept three inches long, and old doctors who are skilled in medicine say that eating one or two green plums is quite beneficial to digestion, but eating too much, because of the astringent nature, is very unfavorable to physiological development, so old doctors, seeing fifteen or sixteen-year-old girls picking and eating green plums, always swallow a mouthful of saliva first, and slowly say, "Eat less, eating too much will make it impossible to have children in the future, then there will be famine." But these words are naturally not welcomed by the girls, so any girl, hearing the old doctors saying this, always gives them a big eye roll, and grumbles, "You want me to say that, I insist on eating." While saying this, they deliberately pick and eat another one, and then twist their hips and walk away very embarrassedly. Whether green plums are beneficial or harmful to the human body, I hope that scientists will tell me.</p>
<p>The use of plums, in the past, green ones were only for children to eat, and ripe ones were called yellow plums. Usually, they were cooked with sugar, perilla, sweet osmanthus, etc., to make plum sauce, or pickled with sugar and sweet osmanthus, called sweet osmanthus plums. These are all very good homemade agricultural products. In addition, there are green plums pickled with salt, called wind and rain plums. This name is quite poetic, and the taste is also good, crispness is its characteristic. I still remember when I was a child, I used to rub the ripe yellow plums until they were very soft, uncover the lid, squeeze out the plum pit, put some sugar powder inside, and use a cleaned yellow fish jaw bone (shovel-shaped) to scoop it up and eat it, which was very fun. Its name is called "Plum Sauce Jar", but in the past, although there were many ways to make plums, they were mostly made by each family for their own family to enjoy. Since the rise of modern manufacturing industry and the popularity of candied peel plums, the use of plums has become more and more widespread.</p>
<p>The use of plums is becoming more and more widespread, and the plum gardens everywhere are also becoming more and more numerous, and the gentlemen and ladies' interest in admiring plum blossoms is naturally becoming higher and higher, which may also be a help to relieve the rural areas.</p>
<p>Peace says: It's terrible, modern warfare actually uses me.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Cherry <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 19</p>
<p>Cherries are now on the market, each and every one of them so charming that they have been praised by people throughout history in countless poems and essays. In the past, within the imperial palace, they were considered a novel seasonal fruit, extremely precious, as evidenced by palace poems.</p>
<p>Song Dynasty's Wang Yuyu wrote in a poem: "Swallows come anew, chirping, announcing spring within the palace. From afar, one hears the cherries ripening in the spring garden, first presented on golden platters to the Purple Throne." According to this, once the cherries ripen, they must first be presented to the Emperor, demonstrating their prestige, which is the first proof. Furthermore, Tang Dynasty's Wang Jian wrote in a palace poem: "The drafting official stands before the white jade window, first tasting the newly reddened cherries bestowed; a message is relayed from the palace to the distant golden steps, requesting a humble bow of gratitude to the Sage." Zhang Wenchang wrote in a palace poem: "Golden rods pluck and tap on sandalwood, the strings are newly tuned, the melody even higher; having thoroughly mastered the new piece from yesterday, palace officials send cherries from beyond the curtain." These two poems show that the cherry was a special imperial gift, seemingly an exceptional honor; the former to console the drafting official's labor, the latter to moisten the palace musician's parched throat. This is the second proof of the cherry's treasurable nature.</p>
<p>Because cherries were so prestigious, palace women would bet on them to win or lose; others would fall ill from excessive indulgence and be sent home, leading to embarrassment and boredom. Wang Jian also recorded two such instances in his palace poems: one about gambling, "Clearly sitting idle, gambling on cherries, putting away the jade wrists weary from tossing arrows into the pot; each with sandalwood dice, competing to see whose roll is higher!" and one about falling ill from gluttony, "Sent home for falling ill from eating cherries, wearing tattered old silk robes for three years. Palace attendants come and go, arranging for golden flowers to be given to the esteemed concubine." Contemplating these two poems together, the cherry's charming allure need not be elaborated upon further.</p>
<p>Moreover, cherry blossoms bloom in the second month of the lunar calendar. In the Tang Dynasty, new Jinshi graduates were often feted beneath the blossoms, called "Cherry Blossom Banquet." This, alongside the "Wild Goose Pagoda Inscription," was celebrated as a refined and elegant occasion of the time; and the sense of triumph felt by the new Jinshi graduates is not difficult to imagine.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Mulberries <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Sen</p>
<p>Mulberries, these things, the big city gentlemen and ladies, probably have never seen them! Their taste, of course, is unknown. But in my hometown, I saw them every year; and I also tasted them. Although they cannot receive the favor of city people like oranges, tangerines, jackfruits, etc., in the countryside, they are loved by the children.</p>
<p>I remember when I was eleven or twelve years old! The warm spring had quietly slipped away. And the hot summer was about to descend. I, along with the neighborhood children from my hometown, held hands, basking in the sunlight, and went to the nearby mulberry garden; climbed to the treetops, picked the branches laden with fruit,挟着 the branches with both feet, and began to feast. However, these places where the fruits were plentiful were often at the tips of the trees, and the numbers were also very small, so everything depended on each person's ability to be strong, and to be able to gain an advantage. However, our team was different from others, which was also because we had been together for a long time and had better feelings. So we often helped each other. And after a full stomach, we still had to pick the big fruits that were red and turned to dark purple. We picked them and took them home to offer to the old people to taste!</p>
<p>The mulberry fruit is the fruit of the mulberry tree, also known as mulberry. It is composed of countless small fruits, shaped like dates. When ripe, it is red in color and turns black, so after we feasted, our lips seemed to be smeared with lipstick, red and big, like the man-eating devils in old novels.</p>
<p>Mulberry juice can dye cloth, dyeing white cloth purple; then wash it with acid water that does not damage the cloth, such as plum water, light vinegar, etc., it turns red; wash it with alkaline water such as soapy water, lime water, soda water, ash water, etc., then it turns green. The green one can be bleached white with sulfur gas, the red one, first wash with alkaline water, first turns green, and then bleach with sulfur turns white.</p>

<p>Chapter 1: Tasting Tea and Making Quiet Conversation, Listening to Rain by the Night Window; Breaking off a Branch, Startling with Beauty's Shadow, Fragrant Flowers Flow Through the Alley</p>
<p>At this time, to go to Ping Shan's house to leave a message, and then return to school, would be too late. Fortunately, Ping Shan left a message last night that he would definitely be waiting at home in the afternoon, so there was no need to go to his house beforehand. Standing in the small alley, hesitating, his footsteps inevitably slowed down. Laughing and jumping, those few children breaking off apricot blossoms also followed. Guoqi also thought, even these few children recognize me, they are so innocent and unrestrained, they would say anything, that would be very inconvenient. With this thought, he did not want to stay, and went to school. He spent most of the day at school, and then class was over. In the past, after class, he would either chat with colleagues, or go to the reading room to read the newspaper, always delaying for a long time. Today, after class, he left the school gate. The meeting that Ping Shan had arranged last night, no matter what, could not be missed again, so he reviewed the few alleys he had passed through in the morning. When he arrived at the alley with the apricot blossoms, he walked very slowly, appreciating from afar the half-tree of apricot blossoms extending beyond the powder wall. Just as the setting sun was shining obliquely on this powder wall, it added infinite charm to this powder wall and half-tree of apricot blossoms. So he put his hands behind his back, and gazed at the apricot blossoms in a trance. This alley was completely quiet in the afternoon. Apart from Guoqi, no one else passed through here. Guoqi looked around at both ends of the alley. Then, with his hands behind his back, he slowly walked towards the end of the alley. But unconsciously, he had caught the girl's habit, taking two steps and looking back. That oval face, those lacquer-like eyes, that narrow and long floral-patterned cloth dress, all appeared before his eyes. At the same time, his nose also smelled a fragrance. This fragrance was very intoxicating, letting one know that there was a quiet girl in front of them. Immediately opening his eyes to look, it was not that a girl was passing by here, but a flower artisan, carrying a load of fresh flowers past. After the flower carrier had carried the load far away, he laughed. He thought to himself that this was really what the literati said to describe people, "love at first sight, giving one's soul to the gaze." It was completely his own infatuation, treating someone he had only met once as the Venus on the table. Although, he really could not help but think about it, she was too much like that Venus. When a person thinks about things to a deep extent, he can be unaware of everything outside of himself. Guoqi was also like this, very inadvertently, leaning against someone else's wall, slowly walking. That subtle fragrance, at this time, came to his nose again. This alley also did not have any flower gardens or flower markets. Where would there be so many peach blossoms passing by? When he looked up, this surprise was no small matter, his heart beating wildly. It was the female student he had met in the morning who was passing by here again. That black, shiny, light braid, that thin floral-patterned cloth jacket, a long white handkerchief tucked into the jacket button, were all the same as in the morning. However, unlike in the morning, she was coming towards him, now she had her back to him, leaving only a back view in front of his eyes. Although Guoqi saw her, he could not follow behind her. He could not help but be a little unsure of which way to go in the twilight sunlight. (22)</p>

<p>— Xia Fei</p>
<p>Regarding the origin of drinking tea, our country has a long history, but according to historical records, it can be known that the popularity of drinking tea really began in the Jin Dynasty and flourished in the Tang Dynasty: However, Lu Yu of the Tang Dynasty once wrote the Classic of Tea, he said: "The use of tea as a drink originated with Shennong, was heard of by the Duke of Zhou in Lu, Yan Ying in Qi, Yang Xiong and Sima Xiangru in Han, Wei Yao in Wu (Biography of Wei Yao in the History of Wu, secretly bestowed tea as a substitute for wine.), Liu Kun and Zhang Zai in Jin, and the ancestors Na Xie An, Zuo Si, and others all drank it. The practice spread widely and became popular in the two capitals and between Jing and Yu during the reigning dynasty." After reading this passage, the history of drinking tea can be roughly understood. As for his saying that it originated with Shennong, that is because it is said that Shennong was our country's ancestral master who tasted all kinds of herbs, so it was attributed to the invention of tea leaves after he tasted them.</p>
<p>Tea leaves are originally one of China's special products, and they are famous at home and abroad; in the past, tea leaves alone accounted for tens of millions of dollars in exports every year, so silk, tea, salt, and wood were regarded as the four major commercial industries in our country at that time. However, there are many regions in China that produce tea, such as: Jiang, Zhe, Yu, Wan, Chuan, Yue, Gui, Shan, Qian, Gan, Gui, Min, etc., with thirteen or fourteen provinces and more than forty counties. However, the brand names produced in various places are not the same, and their value and types are also different. Perhaps this is due to the relationship between soil and climate?</p>
<p>Dongting Biluochun comes from the deep mountains and wilderness of Xishan, Dongting, Taihu. According to ancient legends, this tea industry was caused by birds dropping seeds on Biluo Peak, and then sprouting and growing into wild tea trees. At that time, the young nuns would pick the tender buds and wrap them in silk handkerchiefs, pressed between their breasts, to wait for them to dry slowly. After drying, the fragrant and green tea was lovely, hence the name. However, this kind of legend, the former is still credible, but the latter seems unfounded.</p>
<p>When Emperor Qianlong of the previous Qing Dynasty traveled to Jiangnan, he arrived at Xishan, Dongting. The abbot of Baoshan Temple, Yi, presented this tea brewed with mountain spring water. Qianlong tasted it and greatly praised it, so he bestowed it with a beautiful name and regarded it as a tribute treasure. Other events such as the Panama Fair, the Nanyang Industrial Exposition, etc., have also won excellent awards. In the West Lake Exposition in the 18th year of the Republic of China, a jar of this tea was purchased with heavy money and displayed in the museum. From this, its nobility can be imagined.</p>
<p>The advantages of this tea are that it is clean and fragrant, mellow and not irritating, and its taste is sweet and cool without bitterness. It is said that after drinking it, the teeth and cheeks are cool, the heart is clear and the spleen is refreshing, and the aftertaste is endless. It has the effect of refreshing the mind, promoting body fluid and benefiting the stomach, but it does not have the disadvantage of exciting the nerves. But unfortunately, the local villagers do not know how to promote planting, so the output is not much, and it has not been improved. The method of smoking and making is still the old local method, so the output has not been improved. I believe that if the villagers can further research the smoking and making aspects, the color, aroma and taste will be even better.</p>
<p>Now the new tea is on the market again, so in the recent Dongting Xishan, in that lush green field, you can also see the general village returning home, the slim hands picking, the green and clear, the quiet fragrance, the laughter and the wind, rendering this deep mountain poor valley quite lively, and at the same time, in every big and small city and town, there are also a few more "small tea shops."</p>
<p>"Danqiu Yurren lightly eats jade food, picking tea and drinking it produces wings." I read Jiao Ran's poems and can't help but be fascinated by it.</p>

<h3 id="e188">What is the Result of Smuggling? <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Liutang</p>
<p>The seriousness of smuggling in the North has now aroused deep international attention, which is a natural result. When there are more smuggled goods, the sales of legitimate commercial goods (legitimate goods are those that have had taxes paid) will be hit, which is also an inevitable fact. Due to the impact of rampant smuggling, China's customs duties are trending to decrease by one-third, and countries with creditor relationships with China are worried that the principal and interest will not be secured, so they are inevitably panicked. Furthermore, the result of smuggling simultaneously in the North and the South, the commerce sandwiched in the central region is suffering a huge threat, "fire burning eyebrows," also has the fear of being unable to secure the future. Therefore, these days, the issue of smuggling in China has attracted attention - especially from the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<p>Mr. Ross ran to the North for this, but he couldn't come up with any solution. Originally wanted to preserve British interests in the North, "分我盃"; unexpectedly, the situation of "the guest overshadowing the host" has become established, with a great spirit of "I will not allow others to snore beside my bed." In fact, it is all their own fault. Of course, the Chinese themselves are not trying to make a name for themselves, so don't blame people for not helping; but they often take China as a favor, "being generous with other people's money," today is the time to "reap what you sow." Under such a situation, they still say "We do not underestimate the many difficulties of Japan's policy toward China, nor have we not shown understanding." A British Conservative Party member, Lennox, is still asking "Is it more convenient for the UK to negotiate with Japan if it recognizes 'Manchukuo'?" How the British are accommodating the Japanese is fortunate that the Japanese did not pay attention to him, and we Chinese, who are in the middle of the dilemma, do not know what will happen. The reason why we are so uneasy now is not for anything else, but because "China's customs duties have a loss of 120,000 pounds a month, and foreign debts are guaranteed by customs duties, so we are deeply afraid that the interests of bondholders in European countries (especially the UK?) will be seriously affected." This is to maintain his already obtained interests. However, if China's customs duties have no income at all, they will never fail to demand payment because the collateral is not secured; or even take special action to protect their collateral, otherwise they will definitely demand other collateral from me. In short, they will never easily suffer losses. Therefore, if we hope that international forces will eliminate the losses of smuggling, the hope is equivalent to hoping that the League of Nations will come out to uphold justice and help China recover the lost Northeast Three Provinces. It is generally impossible, at most like the Lytton Report, giving China verbal comfort only.</p>
<p>To solve the smuggling problem by diplomatic means is exactly "seeking skin from a tiger." If you protest to him, he will ignore you. He can also blame China for "negligence in management." He may even say "The steps Japan is now taking in Tianjin are to protect the legitimate commercial interests of the Japanese, which have been greatly damaged as a result of smuggling." The implication is that China's anti-smuggling efforts are not effective(?), and protection is not adequate? Isn't this a strange story of all time? "Strengthening the troops stationed in China" and "increasing the number of troops" are also said to be "the provisions of the Boxer Protocol(?) and do not infringe on China's sovereignty"? Under this kind of unreasonable situation, if the customs seriously implements anti-smuggling measures, it will inevitably lead to conflicts. They will use the excuse of hindering their "legitimate commercial interests" to justify their aggressive actions. If we are determined, then anti-smuggling is our duty. Even if there are other actions, we only know that for the sake of honor and survival, we will not hesitate to sacrifice.</p>
<p>Let's see what the result of smuggling is. On the surface, the following items can probably be seen; we have no way to speculate on the plans hidden in the dark.</p>
<p>(A) Regarding China's finances:</p>
<p>Destroying China's fiscal revenue and plunging it into a predicament.</p>
<p>Destroying China's external credit, because customs duties are collateral for foreign debt compensation.</p>
<p>Destroying China's internal credit, because domestic debt is also guaranteed by customs duties.</p>
<p>Destroying China's credit for continuing to raise domestic and foreign debts, so that the gap between income and expenditure cannot be filled.</p>
<p>Devaluing the guarantee reserve.</p>
<p>Damaging the interests of bondholders.</p>
<p>Forcing foreign creditors to oppress China, so that China has to accept its siege and show its power in China to the outside world.</p>
<p>From destroying the customs duties in the North, or even destroying other tax revenues, stepping up the power to oppress China's finances, and achieving its goal of disintegration.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding China's customs:</p>
<p>It can enable China to be reduced and lower the import tax rate of Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Or take the administration of customs in North China into the hands of the Japanese as a condition for cracking down on smuggling.</p>
<p>Or even because Japanese trade accounts for the first place in China's import goods, forcing the United Kingdom to fulfill its past promise and give the highest administrative position of customs to the Japanese.</p>
<p>From all aspects, destroying the unity of customs administration, making it impossible for China to clean up.</p>
<p>Or in the form of the East Pact and agreements, apply to future tax rules, so that China's customs taxes cannot protect its reality.</p>
<p>(C) Regarding Chinese industry and commerce:</p>
<p>Smuggled goods are cheaper because they are tax-free, and sales are uninhibited.</p>
<p>If merchants do not sell Japanese goods, they will not be able to make a profit.</p>
<p>The original factories and enterprises are completely broken by Japanese goods, and they are unable to operate again, so Japanese merchants invest in acquisitions, becoming their attempt to monopolize Chinese industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Threatening and enticing merchants to take refuge under their banner, as in the past when foreign merchants' flags were hung. And so that Chinese laws are not enforced, and treachery is rampant.</p>
<p>Because bank deposits and private funds are mostly invested in public bonds, the failure to pay principal and interest on time will result in funds being stranded, making the entire economy feel uneasy.</p>
<p>The industry will never have the opportunity to build a revival.</p>
<p>Commerce will forever be a seller of foreign goods.</p>
<p>Agriculture will forever be a supplier of raw materials to others, in a colonial position.</p>
<p>(D) Regarding the industry and commerce of various countries in China:</p>
<p>The goods of various countries cannot withstand the pressure of dumping of Japanese goods, and gradually withdraw from the Chinese market, becoming a Japanese monopoly situation.</p>
<p>If the goods of various countries are unwilling to lag behind, they can only resort to smuggling, causing the Chinese customs officials to suffer losses.</p>
<p>The smuggled goods in South and North China, going south and north, make the central China, the commercial center of the United Kingdom and the United States, unable to support it, and finally surrender.</p>
<p>Factories in China will share the same fate as Chinese factories.</p>
<p>The above is not the fact, but it is just a summary based on speculation, and most people can also infer this. However, I believe that the most noteworthy influence of smuggling is the propaganda that takes smuggling as taking care of "the interests of Chinese people's lives." How can we not know that the formulation of tax rules focuses on fiscal revenue on the one hand, and on the interests of the national economy on the other hand, but the so-called interests of the national economy should not only focus on the consumption aspect, but also on the construction aspect. If we pay attention to consumption, then China has always used foreign goods, so it is best to reduce the import tax on foreign goods, which is most appropriate, but this is what the seller of foreign goods hopes, but the buyer of foreign goods is unwilling. However, in general ignorant people, regardless of whether it is smuggled goods or domestic goods, they only seek cheap goods. Greed for temporary gain will bring endless harm in the future, without regard to the consequences. Drinking poison to quench thirst may be pitiful in the eyes of others, but the person himself is happy with it. Therefore,麻醉 means can make people unknowingly enter its trap, which is the most可怕. The Japanese in China are advancing both politically and economically, and exerting both power and appeasement. Appeasement focuses on the people. He wants to use cotton produced in Zhili and Shandong for his textile industry, so he set up thirteen cotton planting guidance areas in Beijing, Tianjin, Yixian, etc., and dispatched professionals to provide on-site cultivation guidance. The cotton fields in each area were expanded to 5,000 mu or even 10,000 mu; and sales organizations were established to control cotton planting test sites, deepening into the people step by step. He has not only obtained raw materials, but also won over the hearts of the people, and its seriousness is more worthy of attention than the smuggling problem.</p>
<p>Regarding the anti-smuggling measures recently, Minister Kong has already indicated in his recent speech that "smuggling involving diplomatic aspects should be resolved through diplomatic means. Smuggling involving criminal aspects should be severely punished by law. In addition, the audit system and control methods should be used to curb the rampant trend of smuggling." This measure will naturally have the effect of cracking down on smuggling. However, "everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world," if there is no puppet organization in China, smuggling would not be so easy. Without treacherous merchants, smuggled goods would have no way to be sold; with smuggled goods but without care, treacherous merchants would not be able to do anything. Therefore, the rampancy of smuggling is due to the greed for cheap smuggled goods. There is a saying that "greed for cheap will lose cheap," because what is gained is small and what is lost is large. Therefore, if everyone can think from a big picture, have determination, and not wait for people's supervision and encouragement, then everything will have a solution.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Review of the Smuggling Problem <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Xiaofu</p>
<p>I. Overview of Smuggling</p>
<p>China is truly a unique country. Things unseen in other countries can be seen in China; things that others do not encounter are often encountered here. China's problems are undoubtedly increasing day by day, and the exploitation it suffers is intensifying daily. Amidst a myriad of issues and oppressions, the problem of smuggling, with its devastating impact on China's economy, has emerged. This is a manifestation of the imperialist powers desperately intensifying their aggression against China under the increasingly critical global political and economic situation. The impact of Japanese goods smuggling is by no means limited to a few provinces in China; it is connected to the entire Chinese economy and finance, and it affects the overall situation in the Far East and even the world. In terms of significance, this smuggling is not just about evading a customs duty; it involves various aspects that need to be explained.</p>
<p>Regardless of how its development unfolds in form, this smuggling problem is undoubtedly becoming increasingly serious in essence.</p>
<p>Large-scale "armed smuggling" has made China worse than a colony (at least in some ways)! This is because the tariff rights of a colony at least have their integrity in form and are not undermined by such smuggling. Therefore, whatever its ultimate purpose or outcome, the damage this kind of smuggling inflicts on China's tariff rights, its impact on China's economy and finance, and its particularly violent and plunderous methods are undeniable.</p>
<p>In concrete terms, alarming news about smuggling has been pouring in like snowflakes recently. A Central News Agency dispatch from Xuzhou on April 23 stated that 50,000 tons of smuggled goods travel south from Tianjin along the Jinpu Railway each month. A special dispatch from Tianjin on May 5 further claimed that on May 4 and 5 alone, the total amount of smuggled sugar and rayon reached 3,000 tons. For the first four months of this year, the types and amounts of smuggled goods near Tianjin that have been verified (since they are smuggled goods, it is naturally more difficult to verify all their types and amounts) are as follows (Note 1):</p>
<p>This is just a brief account of the smuggled goods shipped into the Tianjin area in the first four months of this year that have been verified. However, the types are already numerous, and the quantities are not small. The resulting "sales stagnation" and "price plunge" have indeed directly devastated the Gushi Market (here referring only to the market for smuggled goods). As a correspondent for the North China Daily News stated (Note 2): "Some say that the rampant smuggling in eastern Hebei will greatly affect legitimate trade in North China, but this statement is not enough to describe the true situation even to a millionth degree. To put it bluntly, several important trades in North China have been completely destroyed by it."</p>
<p>It is not only Hebei Province and the Tianjin area; Shandong has also been greatly affected. Due to the prevalence of smuggled goods, Shandong's native rayon industry is in great danger, and Guangdong, Fujian, Shanghai, and other places have also been devastated by smuggled goods. (Of course, foreign goods smuggled into China do not only come through North China; there is also a large amount of smuggling in other places, such as Xiamen and Shantou. However, at present, North China's gateways are the most open.)</p>
<p>II. The Blow Smuggling Deals to China</p>
<p>The above-mentioned disruption of smuggled goods in Hebei, Shandong, Guangdong, Fujian, and Shanghai is just an example; in reality, the impact of smuggled goods is by no means limited to these places. If smuggled goods continue to flood in, the entire Chinese market will inevitably be filled with them—if so, then China's vast market will become a market for smuggled goods, and a strange new page can be opened in the history of world commerce. Its impact on China's rural and urban areas is enormous. The sales of certain Chinese products, such as sugar, will plummet in price. Not to mention rice, even now, under the influence of smuggling, two sugar factories in Guangdong have already announced their closure. Therefore, we know that smuggled goods such as rayon and sugar are the most capable of harming rural China because silk and cane sugar are still the main sideline products of rural areas in several provinces of China. Moreover, smuggled goods not only ravage Chinese products of the same type as the smuggled goods; other businesses will also be affected, such as the shipping industry in South China and the Yangtze River, which has become even more decadent due to smuggled goods. ("However, the number of Japanese ships sailing from Shanghai to Fuzhou has increased from three to six during this downturn. The reason for this is not difficult to guess" (Note 3)). Therefore, smuggling directly and indirectly strikes the entire Chinese economy with fierce force; if it is not stopped, it will undoubtedly be extremely dangerous for China's economic future. We know that the Chinese economy was already in a precarious state, and how can it withstand this kind of supra-economic damage? In other countries, when there is an economic panic, they tighten their tariff barriers and use all offensive and defensive methods to seek economic recovery and transfer the consequences of the panic. But in our country, it is exactly the opposite. In such an economically urgent situation, not to mention anything else, even a low tariff wall (certainly not a barrier, let alone a tight one) has been largely pushed down by smuggling. This is a portrait of "man is the knife, and I am the fish." However, this is precisely the phenomenon that erupts from the poison of world capitalism and its entire contradiction.</p>
<p>The first and most direct impact of smuggling is naturally on China's finances. A Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on April 25 stated: "The national budget for the 25th year is being compiled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics in conjunction with various ministries and commissions... However, due to reasons such as reduced imports and rampant smuggling, customs duties have decreased compared to the figures for the 24th year." This clearly tells us that China's finances have been affected by smuggling. From this dispatch, we can also see that one of the main reasons for the trade surplus last December and this January lies in the "rampant smuggling" (Note 4), this comical secret. Because "rampant smuggling" naturally leads to "reduced imports" (another important reason for reduced imports is the absolute decline in the purchasing power of the Chinese people, especially the masses). China's finances, like China's economy, are actually becoming increasingly difficult. However, instead of being able to increase customs duties at this time, they have become weak due to smuggling. It is truly "adding frost to snow" and "misfortune never comes singly."</p>
<p>In this way, the astonishing loss suffered by China from this smuggling can no longer be described as a "leak"; it can only be described as a bottomless cup.</p>
<p>China's industry is still in its infancy, and protective tariffs are very necessary. If China wants to completely transform from a medieval production system to a modern production system, then protective tariffs should have a leverage effect. This is because the protective tariff system is a strategy used to forcefully shorten the transition period from medieval production to modern production (Note 5). This can be seen in the history of advanced countries. The dispute over British tariff policy often became the central topic of Parliament and the government for a long time, and the important relationship between tariffs and a country's economy can be seen. Today, in the era of "national monopoly capitalism" and collective economic rule, the protective tariffs of the great powers are even more stringent. (Of course, this kind of protective tariff is somewhat different from the protective tariffs in the early days of industrial development and the mercantilist era). Moreover, the socio-economic situation of the great powers is actually becoming increasingly urgent, so the tariff barriers of the great powers are also becoming higher and higher. Only in China, tariff rights have never been completely autonomous, and now there are even more loopholes and great difficulties. This also shows the extent of China's national power.</p>
<p>III. Characteristics of Smuggling</p>
<p>This kind of smuggling is essentially different from ordinary smuggling.</p>
<p>Smuggling has always been a common phenomenon, and there are well-known precedents in history. Its being a common phenomenon can be told to us by daily observations, and there is no need to elaborate here. As for its well-known precedents in history, one can look at Britain's fierce smuggling to continental Europe during the Napoleonic era. At that time, Napoleon, in order to compete with Britain, created the Continental System, sealing off British goods so that they could not circulate in Europe. But British goods finally reached their inherent market through smuggling (Note 6). However, Britain's implementation of smuggling was due to Napoleon's sealing off of British goods. Moreover, Britain's smuggling at that time mainly relied on economic conditions and was carried out outside the law, rather than directly smuggling to France by force. Today, China has not sealed off Japanese goods (on the contrary, Japanese goods are extremely popular in China). But Japanese goods are actually "armed smuggling" in this way, which is indeed (in form) opening up the latest record in the field of smuggling, forming a novel event that has never existed before. This can be said to be a special kind of smuggling. This is also the characteristic of this smuggling.</p>
<p>In other words, since this kind of smuggling openly and forcibly transports various huge amounts of goods into China without restriction (China's limited consumption power is, of course, an insurmountable restriction) (Note 7), and the market for smuggled goods has become a free trade market. Since "smuggling has become free trade" (Note 8), then "smuggling" has lost its meaning of "private," and it is more accurate to say that it is "public" than "private." (Of course, from the perspective of the simple economic category of tariffs, no matter how openly it is done, it should always be regarded as smuggling). In this way, China not only does not have the slightest trace of protective tariffs, but also smuggling has become free trade! This is truly a novel event in economic history and even economics. Undoubtedly, this shows the new posture and special way in which imperialism oppresses China. This reflects the extent to which imperialists' exploitation of China has become profound and the extent to which it has become cruel.</p>
<p>After the Opium War in 1842, British imperialism forced China to sign the Treaty of Nanjing and later, based on the Treaty of Nanjing, forced the conclusion of a tariff agreement, seizing China's customs power. The purpose was to turn China into a dependency, bind its production, and make it permanently sink under its iron hooves, only able to provide markets and raw materials, and unable to enjoy true independence and freedom. Manipulating China's tariff rights is one of the most important weapons for exploiting China, not only directly extracting from taxes, but also indirectly plundering from the economy. However, in form, this still went through the formalities of the treaty, and in essence, it was not a complete plunder. But the current large-scale "armed smuggling" is a further step in exploitation—from partial deprivation to complete plunder—which is more direct, more violent, and more cruel than manipulating China's tariff rights. From the perspective of those who implement smuggling, this can also be said to be hand-to-hand combat, which can be said to be a manifestation of the currently prevalent "plunder system." This kind of phenomenon only exists in today's entire emergency situation. Conversely speaking, this kind of phenomenon also reflects the current crisis in Japan and the entire situation. At the same time, the more panic the situation, the more violently imperialism destroys China. This point is also proven by this kind of smuggling.</p>
<p>IV. The General Essential Significance of Smuggling</p>
<p>From an essential point of view, smuggling in general is a special means for capital to attack foreign countries and plunder colonies and semi-colonies. This is generally a strategy adopted under certain special occasions. The purpose of applying this strategy is to maintain and even expand the export of goods, in order to seek the maintenance of average profits and even the acquisition of additional profits. This is the trend of capital's nature, and its driving force and power are very strong. (This can also partially explain the victory of British smuggling during the Napoleonic era mentioned above). Regarding this point, T.J. Dunning once had a very thorough explanation, which is excerpted and translated as follows:</p>
<p>Capital does not avoid profits, or even small profits, just as nature (Naiure) abhors a vacuum, as previously said. With considerable profits, capital is very brave. A profit of 10 percent will guarantee the use of capital in any place; a profit of 20 percent, capital becomes eager; a profit of 50 percent, capital becomes bold; a profit of 100 percent, capital is ready to trample on all human laws. For a profit of 300 percent, capital will not hesitate to commit any crime, take any risk, even if the owner of the capital is in danger of being killed... Smuggling and the slave trade fully prove these points (Note 9).</p>
<p>Dunning's words truly depict the face of capital. The current smuggling of Japanese goods is called "internationally unethical" by a certain reporter (Note 10). This reporter is not very aware of the nature of capital. "The Japanese consular authorities have publicly declared that smuggling into China is not illegal under Japanese law" (Note 11). This statement by the consular authorities is to cater to the nature of capital, simply interpreting smuggling as not illegal.</p>
<p>V. The Deepening Conflicts Between the Powers Over Smuggling</p>
<p>This kind of smuggling is produced in the context of the powers' struggle for private interests in China, which is also the result of the increasingly serious conflicts of interest between the powers in China. Facts tell us that the smuggling of Japanese goods has been rapidly strengthened since the announcement of China's monetary policy on November 3 last year. Because this monetary policy of China dealt a significant blow to the superior exchange conditions of Japanese goods exported to China, the smuggling of Japanese goods has rapidly become serious. The main economic purpose of this smuggling is, of course, to maintain and even increase the export of Japanese goods to China, in an attempt to compete favorably with other powers in China. And because China's new currency system is linked to the British pound, Japan is even attempting to use smuggling (supplemented by policies such as smuggling silver dollars) to help undermine China's new monetary policy and strike at the advantage held by Britain in China's monetary power (naturally, Japan's enemies in China are not just Britain). Naturally, after the smuggling problem became serious, Ross ran to North China to investigate, inquire, and plot how to compete for rights. At the same time, the British Parliament in London also paid great attention to the Chinese smuggling problem (Note 11) because this kind of smuggling not only affects British imperialism's trade and debt claims in China but also involves the advantage that Britain has recently obtained in China's currency. In addition, other powers, witnessing this flood of smuggling, are all concerned about their interests in China and are thinking of ways to intensify their struggle. Therefore, from this aspect, this kind of smuggling will also exacerbate the conflicts between the powers in China. By extension, this kind of smuggling may even deepen the contradictions of imperialism in the Far East, the Pacific, and even the world, and make them even more intricate and inextricable!</p>

Any goods you need can be transported in at any time, unless they are as bulky as elephants, which are slightly difficult.' See Note 1 above."</p>
<p>(Note 8) "You can no longer call this smuggling, because it is actually free trade. Judging from the current situation, Beidaihe is not only a free trade port (the so-called free trade port means that no customs duties are paid, which is the so-called Free tradeport), but even its coastal areas are all freely open."

Eden replied that he was actively considering ways to protect the trade of British subjects in North China and the security of foreign debts." (Reuters dispatch from London on April 29).</p>

<h3 id="e190">Finance: Call Loan Interest Rate Slightly Dropped One Fen Yesterday <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the financial market was calm. Due to the bank holiday, the market was relatively quiet. The call loan interest rate was 8 fen in both the morning and afternoon, down one fen from the previous day. Promissory note transactions amounted to over 1.7 million in the morning and over 200,000 in new transactions. Afternoon transactions were over 100,000. The Small General Association's transactions were over 300,000. Qianzhuang Foreign Public Order receipts and remittances totaled over 4.1 million, and remittances from various routes were over 300,000. For auxiliary currency transactions, 15,000 jiao of Guangdong minor coins were traded in the morning. The unofficial market price remained at 12 jiao and 0.02 li. There were no major buyers in the unofficial market for copper coins, with 4,840 strings traded, totaling 1,600 legal tender yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Securities: The Bond Market Fluctuated Greatly Last Week <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Last week (May 11 to 16), the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange saw very turbulent market conditions with drastic fluctuations. Trading volume also increased gradually. On the stock front, large bullish players made some disposals, but they did not release a large quantity. The seller with the largest bullish position, No. 35, only released a small amount from Friday to Saturday, but they still sold selectively and did not rush to unload. No. 4 initially hoped, but then looked for a way out. No. 17 began to sell high. No. 11 was the largest buyer, and No. 72 sold high and bought low in a very orderly manner. Therefore, from the perspective of supply and demand of stocks, it is not yet time to see the picture. However, the bullish side's barriers are very high and there are already some cracks. The initial environment was dull. The death of Hu Hanmin did not affect the market. The Sino-US Economic Agreement triggered speculation of Sino-US loans, which greatly stimulated the market. For a while, there were more bullish than bearish. However, the smuggling problem became more and more intense, the number of chips increased, and there was overcrowding among the bulls. Given that there are not many days left this month, the market is not expected to undergo great changes. Last week's events: Monday, the Beiping side bought, No. 35 continued to buy, and Nos. 10 and 47 sold, with a small price increase of 3-4 jiao. Tuesday's trading was less active. No. 72 bought, returning 2-3 jiao to 7 jiao. Wednesday morning was stable. In the afternoon, there were sudden loan rumor's, causing a rapid surge. Class A bonds saw a new high of 69.2 yuan, a sharp increase of over one yuan compared to before. When the loan rumors proved to be false and the Sino-US agreement was only about stabilizing exchange rates, the price recovered by a small 3-5 jiao. Friday saw a sudden and alarming rumor that troops were being increased in North China, which materialized with No. 35 unloading, causing the market price to suddenly fall by 8-9 jiao. Saturday was relatively stable, but investor sentiment remained sluggish and the market was weak and listless. Based on observations of the various parties' actions over the week, there are too many chips, and the merchants buying the goods are not strong enough. The progress of the Sino-US negotiations has no real economic relationship, and smuggling in North China is expanding. Speculating on all these situations, the future is difficult to be optimistic about. The results of the week's market price showed a mixture of highs and lows, with minimal fluctuations. The market price is still high. The total volume of transactions was 30,001,500 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened lower due to Southern sales and bullish liquidations, falling one to six pounds per tone compared to the previous day. English cotton spot prices rose 2 points, and futures prices rose 1 point. Indian cotton initially rose due to overseas news favorable to bulls and short covering, but then fell due to brokers reselling. Pingoor fell 0.75 rupees, Aumla fell 0.5 rupees to 0.75 rupees, and White Rowley fell 0.375 rupees to 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 16th).</p>
<p>According to a Bombay dispatch, the opening forecast for the July-August White Rowley cotton futures on the 18th was 200 rupees and 5, down one and a half rupees from the previous day.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the grain market trend was flat. The official market price of No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar, as well as Dongchi white, Benchang cotton white, Zhenji, Zhenyu, Dahua, and Jinxin brands, had no significant changes. Transactions were scarce. The Hongchao gang opened over 1,000 packages of Hainan red, priced at 11 yuan, a further drop of 4 jiao compared to the previous market price. It was also heard that other shops were also willing to reduce prices. Although prices have already dropped by a yuan or so, there is still no sign of a turnaround, mainly due to poor sales in the north. In addition, there were over 180 packages of branch red, priced at 11.6 to 11.45 yuan. There were also hundreds of packages of Huanggang Green, priced at 10 yuan. There were no transactions for other miscellaneous goods. The factory price for White Water First Grade was 24.8 yuan, and the price for Second Grade was 14.7 yuan.</p>
<p>The city's sugar inventory has decreased slightly and increased (as of May 16).</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, only a dozen or so sources remained, totaling over 3,000 names. Retail sales were lackluster. The Tianjin Dalian gang handled 700 packages of steamed stuffed buns, so the market is still difficult to revitalize. Early thick keng rice remained steady with a hint of weakness, while bo rice remained steady. Du Yangjian and Yin Bianyuan were all similar.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 25-26 sources from various routes downstream. The market's appetite for various goods was even more sluggish than the previous market. The market price of white keng rice fell slightly by 6-7 fen. The price of high-quality rice rose by a small number of fen. The medium-quality price fell by nearly a jiao. Retail sales of Yin Bianyuan were dull, with the price weakening by 5 fen. Yang Dujian and Port Merchant Jian also showed a weakening trend. The prices of all other goods were also weakening.</p>

<p>The spot tin sales market has always been the largest in Shaoxing, Ningbo, and Hangzhou. However, in recent times, the market conditions in various places have been weak, and credit has been tight, so spot sales have been sluggish and the situation is very quiet. Standard opening prices have therefore been quite pessimistic. Although the surface market appears to be stable, bulk transactions can still be reduced by around 3-4 yuan. It is heard that only 30-40 dan were traded yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e196">The Origin of Acid Reflux and Nausea <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Li Fumin</p>
<p>People with impaired gastric digestive function often experience acid reflux and nausea due to excessive stomach acid, leading to gastric dilation, gastric spasm, and other symptoms. Patients suffer from indigestion, decreased appetite, insufficient nutrition, anemia, post-meal bloating, or abdominal pain and bloating. Constipation or loose stools may also result.</p>
<p>"Strong Stomach Essence" is a stomachic medicine based on the latest scientific theory and gradually improved through hundreds of practical experiments. It is highly effective for all kinds of diseases caused by impaired digestive function. Famous doctors in Europe and America have long abandoned their old stomach medicines and mostly use "Strong Stomach Essence." According to my statistical analysis of clinical experiments over the years, 96-97% of patients with stomach diseases who take "Strong Stomach Essence" are cured, breaking the records of famous stomach medicines in the past.</p>

<p>Cured of Coughing Up Blood and Phlegm</p>
<p>Patient: Mr. Wen Xiu'en, 25 years old, academic. Cause: Depression leading to illness, compounded by a cold. Symptoms: Occasional dry coughs, coughing up blood-streaked sputum, fibrous (i.e., spherical sputum), slightly labored breathing, palpitations with exertion, chest pain, nocturnal emission and night sweats, kidney deficiency and weakness, daily fatigue, ineffective medication, and worsening insomnia. Last spring, upon hearing that Ms. Xie Yuzhen, a female friend, had been cured of severe pulmonary tuberculosis by taking German "Bufei Na'er" (Lung Supplement Nar), he took a large amount and indeed saw a reduction in sputum and blood, and a gradual cessation of coughing. He then came to me to inquire if he could continue taking it for treatment. After an X-ray examination, it was diagnosed as stage two pulmonary tuberculosis. In addition to instructing him to continue taking the medication, I also administered injections and prescribed German "Buti Kang" (Body Supplement Kang) to strengthen the brain and body, addressing his kidney deficiency and insomnia. After taking five bottles of each, his weight gradually increased, his spirits were greatly lifted, his waist and legs felt lighter, and his movements became more energetic. He recently came to my clinic for a check-up, saying that Ms. Xie is now married.</p>
<p>Phlegm and Chest Pain Alleviated</p>
<p>Patient: Mr. Fan Guiting, 36 years old, merchant. Cause: Early masturbation, followed by overindulgence in marital relations after marriage. Symptoms: Gradually decreasing appetite, dull chest pain, frequent coughing, thick sputum, irritability and insomnia, nocturnal emission and lower back pain, and a frail body. He had been treated repeatedly without improvement, and then sought treatment at my clinic. Diagnosis: After X-ray and stethoscope examination, I found severe pulmonary tuberculosis, which could not be cured by ordinary preparations. I advised him on rest and administered special injections for lung disease, and prescribed "Bufei Na'er" to clear phlegm and cough. This is a hormone preparation made from the liver, lungs, and pancreas of turtles, flounders, bears, and deer. At the same time, he was prescribed "Buti Kang" to cure insomnia and weakness. After taking it for three weeks, his condition greatly improved, and he continued to take several more bottles with peace of mind for a month, resulting in a complete cure. I recently received a letter from him saying that he is strong, healthy, his muscles are full, and his kidneys are strong and rejuvenated.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Amazing Results in Treating Gonorrhea <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Report by Dr. Perutz</p>
<p>The key to treating gonorrhea is immediate treatment with effective and appropriate medication, which can lead to complete recovery and prevent recurrence. However, using inferior medicines indiscriminately for immediate relief will inevitably lead to endless troubles. Traditional gonorrhea medications often focus on local membrane sterilization, using creams presumptuously claiming rapid results. In reality, there is no single bottle that can cure gonorrhea completely. Even the latest German "Kelinong" (Gonorrhea Conqueror) gonorrhea treatment requires three or four bottles for a complete cure. This applies to most situations. In acute cases, continuous use of four or five bottles can ensure the eradication of gonococci and prevent recurrence. In chronic gonorrhea, treatment with seven or eight bottles is invariably effective! For gonorrhea-related inflammation of the testicles, prostate, and joints, at most a dozen bottles will completely clear the inflammation, reduce swelling, and clear up discharge, resulting in clean urine. According to Dr. Perutz's recent report, over 95% of male patients who took this medicine were completely cured. For women, in addition to taking this medicine, external use of "Ka'er Xuedishi" (Carle Xuedishi) vaginal tablets can treat gonorrhea-related leucorrhea, resulting in even faster results, with a cure rate of over 97%. Since its introduction, this medicine has been extremely well-received in Europe and the United States, with doctors and patients alike consistently praising its effectiveness, which is as reliable as a drum and stick.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: When taking medication, it is crucial to pay serious attention to authenticity and not treat it lightly. Therefore, when purchasing, be sure to recognize the words "Kelinong" and do not mistakenly purchase cheap, generic inferior drugs that deceive people based on others' recommendations, as this could lead to life-threatening dangers.</p>

<p>New Treatment for Chronic Gonorrhea</p>
<p>With the progress of modern science, various medical fields are also advancing rapidly. For example, chronic gonorrhea, which was once considered difficult to cure, now has a special new treatment. Although the root of chronic gonorrhea is deep, eliminating gonorrhea is not difficult if anti-gonorrhea serum, electrotherapy, and effective internal medications are applied. One important thing to note is that married patients must be treated at the same time to avoid mutual infection.</p>
<p>Recently, the number of gonorrhea patients has been increasing, and the number of chronic gonorrhea cases is also increasing. Therefore, I often encounter such cases in my clinical practice. However, the reason why most of them cannot be cured is the lack of attention to the treatment of both husband and wife. Mr. Sima Jian, who lives on Zhejiang Road, had been suffering from gonorrhea for nearly seven years, with relapses following each cure, never completely eradicated. Later, he purchased "The Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" from the Dadong Bookstore and sought my treatment. I observed that his testicles were dull and painful, and the right testicle was becoming hardened, losing its ability to produce sperm. After exertion, his urine was very cloudy, indicating chronic orchitis. I used anti-gonorrhea serum and electrotherapy to stimulate the stiff and paralyzed cells. At the same time, I prescribed "Kelinong" internally to eliminate deep gonococci and promote diuresis and reduce inflammation. After three weeks, the condition improved, and he returned for further treatment. I continued to apply the above physical therapy and prescribed "Kelinong." After a total of six weeks, he was completely cured. His wife had also contracted the disease earlier, with excessive leucorrhea and local erosion, affecting urination and sexual intercourse. I prescribed "Kelinong" internally to promote diuresis and eliminate gonorrhea, and "Ka'er Xuedishi" vaginal tablets externally, one tablet to be inserted into the vagina as a suppository every night to clear the leucorrhea. After four weeks, the leucorrhea disappeared, the pain stopped, and the lesions healed. The couple has been living together for several years, and despite various stimuli, there has been no recurrence of the disease.</p>

<p>— Manuscript by Ms. Huang Chou Dai</p>
<p>I used to eat quickly without chewing properly, which gradually led to stomach problems. I became afraid of eating, feeling bloated after eating, dull abdominal pain, occasional vomiting, acid reflux, and belching. My appetite decreased day by day, my body became weaker, and I gradually suffered from neurasthenia, insomnia, heart palpitations, dizziness, and headaches. I tried almost all kinds of stomach medicines, but none of them cured the problem. Because my cousin, Hu Shaomei, was cured of a long-standing stomach ailment by taking German "Qiangwei Jing" (Strong Stomach Essence), I tried to buy and take it. In just three weeks, my appetite increased significantly, and all kinds of stomach symptoms disappeared. So I continued to take several bottles, finding joy in eating, sleeping soundly, and gaining weight rapidly, with a vibrant spirit.</p>

<p>(1) Nocturnal Emission and Leucorrhea Together</p>
<p>Patient: Mr. Ni Jinliang, 23 years old. After visiting a brothel one evening, he experienced nocturnal emission that night, and gonorrhea broke out the next morning. He tried various medications on the market, but none were effective. Later, he was introduced to my clinic for treatment. After a brief surgical procedure, I prescribed "Kelinong" to reduce inflammation and eliminate bacteria, and "Buti Kang" to strengthen the sexual nerves. After two weeks of treatment, a microscopic examination showed that the gonorrhea had decreased by 60-70%. I prescribed the same medication again, and after ten days, the gonorrhea was cleared and the nocturnal emission stopped. Various stimuli showed no reaction to gonorrhea, proving a complete cure. Mr. Ni's rapid recovery was entirely due to the effectiveness of "Kelinong."</p>
<p>(2) Urethral Spasmodic Pain</p>
<p>Patient: Mr. Wang Xingzai, 29 years old, contracted gonorrhea at the age of 21. He had been cured twice, but relapsed after marital relations at home. Recently, he experienced spasmodic pain in the urethra every time he urinated. All surgeries were not possible. I prescribed German "Kelinong" to relieve pain, eliminate gonorrhea, and clear the urine. After three weeks of treatment, the pain was reduced and the urine was clearer. However, a microscopic examination still showed some gonococcal threads. I prescribed "Kelinong" for another ten days or so, which led to a complete cure. However, Mr. Wang had already infected his wife with gonorrhea, resulting in persistent leucorrhea. The urination was stinging, with pus and blood dripping, and lower abdominal pain. I prescribed "Kelinong" internally to treat her internal gonorrhea, and "Ka'er Xuedishi" vaginal tablets externally, one tablet to be inserted into the vagina as a suppository every night before bedtime to clear the leucorrhea. After four weeks of treatment, the leucorrhea was gone, and the eroded parts were restored to normal.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Dr. Chen Shaohua's Endocrine Experiment Report <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Decisive Treatment for Neurasthenia</p>
<p>Among the most painful and difficult-to-cure diseases, neurasthenia is the most prominent. This condition is often caused by congenital deficiencies and masturbation during puberty, or early marriage and overindulgence in sexual activity, which deplete the youth glands and lead to a lack of endocrine secretion. This results in insomnia, forgetfulness, poor memory, slow thinking, mental confusion, nocturnal emission, kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, and weakness in men, and irregular menstruation, persistent leucorrhea, infertility, or frequent childbirth in women. In both sexes, insufficient endocrine secretion often leads to incomplete development, with men having small genitals and women having dry, shriveled breasts, withered appearance, wrinkled faces, and freckles, diminishing health and happiness, a major hidden danger in life.</p>
<p>To remedy such natural physiological deficiencies, the most appropriate endocrine preparations must be taken. German Dr. Meren's male "Buti Kang" and female "Bunv Rong" (Beauty Replenisher), are made from the endocrine secretions of strong animals such as orangutans, lions, tigers, and sea dogs, respectively, and are highly effective in enhancing human cells, promoting development, turning weakness into strength. The medicine is gentle and does not harm the stomach and has no stimulation. For example, Mr. Jiang Minji had underdeveloped genitals, nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, insomnia, palpitations, forgetfulness, dizziness, and kidney atrophy, leading to marital discord. After being prescribed "Buti Kang" for just over a month, he recovered, his vitality returned, his kidneys became strong, he worked energetically, and he became increasingly healthy. Women with infertility or multiple births due to endocrine disorders can achieve appropriate fertility by taking "Bunv Rong," which also has a great effect on regulating menstruation and strengthening the body. It can also invigorate cells, promote breast development, and, if taken regularly for one or two months, can make the skin delicate and maintain youthfulness.</p>
<h3 id="e203">It's Hot! Leucorrhea is Even More Annoying! <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Yue Ren</p>
<p>Leucorrhea in women is usually annoying, but it only soils clothing, causing only personal discomfort. In summer, if these secretions are not eradicated, they emit a peculiar and strong odor that spreads with the wind, causing those who smell it to cover their noses. No matter how fragrant the perfume, it is difficult to mask this odor. Moreover, in summer, there are more infectious bacteria, which can easily lead to danger.</p>
<p>"Ka'er Xuedishi Vaginal Tablets" are an effective medicine for leucorrhea. Whether it is a long-term or new condition, or leucorrhea caused by physical weakness or a husband's gonorrhea, resulting in inflammation, swelling, decay, amenorrhea, infertility, coldness in the lower abdomen, and painful urination, it can be used to achieve results within a few days, eradicating leucorrhea. Those with physical weakness can also take "Bunv Rong" internally, and those with leucorrhea caused by a husband's gonorrhea can also take "Kelinong" internally, taking care of both internal and external issues for even faster results. As summer is approaching, it is especially important to seek timely treatment. When using "Ka'er Xuedishi," one tablet can be inserted into the vagina every night and washed away the next morning. The method is simple, non-irritating, and most suitable for home treatment.</p>

<p>The Harm of Self-Abuse</p>
<p>Mr. Li Yucheng asks: I am 22 years old. When I was 15 years old in elementary school, I was induced by older classmates to develop a bad habit of self-abuse. At 18, I suffered from nocturnal emission, resulting in poor development, mental weakness, dizziness, forgetfulness, and inability to concentrate on reading. Please advise what medicine can be used to treat it. After recovery, can I develop normally?</p>
<p>(Answer) This is because the youth glands have been destroyed by masturbation, causing injury. In addition to quitting masturbation, you must take a large amount of "Buti Kang" to transform the sexual organs and make them fully develop. The nocturnal emission, forgetfulness, and other conditions can also be cured.</p>
<p>Long-Term Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Mr. Yiding asks: I have been suffering from gonorrhea for many years, and my joints ache all over my body, especially on rainy days. My wife also suffers from leucorrhea due to my gonorrhea, and her lower body is eroded and extremely painful. Is there a way to cure both of us? Please advise!</p>
<p>(Answer) Your condition is gonococcal arthritis. Please ask Dr. Yao Juyan to perform anti-gonorrhea blood treatment to eliminate widespread gonococci. Before treatment, take "Kelinong" to prevent the spread of bacteria. If you can maintain your health, taking "Kelinong" can also cure it. As for your wife's leucorrhea, she must use "Ka'er Xuedishi Vaginal Tablets" externally, inserting one tablet into the vagina at home for self-treatment to treat the leucorrhea, and take "Kelinong" to eliminate internal gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Thin Body and Cough</p>
<p>Mr. Kong Te asks: My nephew Wen Xuan has been suffering from lung disease. Recently, because he has been studying too hard at school, his condition has worsened, with frequent coughing, blood in his sputum, a weakened body, and a poor appetite. Please ask if there is still a way to save him?</p>
<p>(Answer) This pulmonary tuberculosis is nearing the third stage. You can ask Dr. Deng Yuanhe for treatment, and you can also take "Bufei Na'er" (Lung Supplement Nar), which should be able to save him.</p>
<p>Irregular Menstruation</p>
<p>Jing Yongyan asks: My wife is 22 years old. She has been married for five years and has not had any children. She has irregular menstruation, abdominal pain during menstruation, lower back pain, and a lot of leucorrhea, which stains her underclothes. What medicine can regulate menstruation and stop leucorrhea?</p>
<p>(Answer) You can take "Bunv Rong" (Beauty Replenisher) to regulate menstruation. Use "Ka'er Xuedishi Vaginal Tablets" externally to eliminate leucorrhea. With regulated menstruation and clean leucorrhea, conception will be easier.</p>

<h3 id="e205">A Wang Expresses Satisfaction <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Idle</p>
<p>Recently, a foreign news report had the headline "A Wang Expresses Satisfaction with the League of Nations' Actions." I searched my brain but could not figure out why A Wang would still be satisfied with the League of Nations today. After reading the news carefully, I learned that A Wang expressed satisfaction with the League of Nations Administrative Council's refusal to recognize Italian Ambassador to Geneva, Aloisi, as able to represent Abyssinia in the Administrative Council meeting. In fact, the League of Nations had already resolved that Italy was an aggressor state in the Italian-Abyssinian War and had decided on and announced the implementation of sanctions. Now, if it were to recognize the Italian representative in Geneva as having the right to represent Abyssinia, even if the League of Nations did not consider Abyssinia's interests, it would be embarrassing for the League of Nations itself.</p>
<p>Since Italy began its aggression against Abyssinia, Abyssinia has always requested the League of Nations and trusted the League of Nations, and followed the League of Nations' orders. When the League of Nations resolved that Italy was an aggressor state, A Wang expressed satisfaction. Later, when it was resolved to sanction Italy, A Wang was even more satisfied. Now A Wang has already fled, Italian troops have entered the Abyssinian capital, and Italy has conferred upon the Italian king the title of Emperor of Abyssinia, and Italy has publicly declared that all Abyssinian territory belongs to Italy, yet A Wang is still satisfied with the League of Nations' actions. Is it truly satisfaction or dissatisfaction?</p>
<p>In fact, how could A Wang have any satisfaction with the actions of the League of Nations? However, it is clear that the League of Nations has made no other moves that would be truly satisfactory, except for a few resolutions that are somewhat satisfactory. If the League of Nations did not have these few resolutions and did not refuse the Italian representative's right to represent Abyssinia, then the League of Nations would no longer be the League of Nations. Let me briefly review the League of Nations itself. The League of Nations was originally organized with England, France, Japan, Germany, and Italy as its core. Now, Germany and Japan have long withdrawn from the League of Nations, and Italy itself is an aggressor state, so the only remaining backbone members of the League of Nations are England and France. And among these two countries, they are sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams. Therefore, when Japan invaded our country, the League of Nations could do nothing, and when Italy invaded Abyssinia, the League of Nations could also do nothing. Although Germany is not a country that has invaded others, it suddenly abolished the Treaty of Versailles, stationed troops on the Rhine, and is increasingly threatening to annex Austria, yet the League of Nations can do nothing. Because the League of Nations itself is mostly composed of aggressor states, it is a dream to seek help from the League of Nations and satisfy small and weak nations.</p>
<p>Perhaps it can be said that strong countries must first consider their own interests. If there is a conflict of interest among the five strong countries, then small and weak countries may perish in an instant, or may obtain considerable satisfaction. This statement is not entirely true. The conflict of interest between England and Italy in the Italian-Abyssinian War cannot be said to be insignificant. Not only is there a great conflict of interest between England and Italy in Abyssinia, but there is also bound to be a conflict of power in the Mediterranean Sea and the Suez Canal in the future. Therefore, the failure of Abyssinia this time is also the failure of the League of Nations, and not only the failure of the League of Nations, but also the failure of England.</p>
<p>The other day, the Italian Ambassador to Geneva, Aloisi, dissatisfied with the attitude of the League of Nations Administrative Council, led all the Italian representatives and left the country. Although Aloisi's departure from Geneva and return to his country did not explicitly declare withdrawal from the League of Nations, it is self-evident that his intention to withdraw from the League of Nations is the dominant factor. Therefore, what the League of Nations will do in the future, and the evolution of the problem, are unimaginable.</p>
<h3 id="e206">After Watching "Resurrection" <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>Performance by the China Traveling Theater at the Carlton</p>
<p>Because of different viewpoints, different people have different opinions on certain things; for example, Tolstoy's "Resurrection" is like that.</p>
<p>"Resurrection" is a very touching story, and it has been adapted for the screen three times; and recently, in the Chinese theater scene, there are also three adaptations of that world-famous work into stage plays.</p>
<p>One is the one that the Diantong Theater planned to perform before, adapted by Tang Na; one is the one performed by the Nanjing China Stage Association, adapted by Tian Han; and another is the one performed by the China Traveling Theater, which is said to have been adapted from the original play by a French writer and translated into Chinese by Chen Mian.</p>
<p>We will not talk about the first two now; what is discussed here is my impression after watching the "China Traveling Theater's" "Resurrection".</p>
<p>In "Resurrection," the person who should receive the most sympathy from the audience is Gedisha. She was abandoned by the "Prince," she was also expelled by the "Prince's" aunt, she struggled with poverty, but in the end, she could not overcome it and fell into depravity. Moreover, she did not commit any crime, but she received a twenty-year sentence and was exiled to Siberia. As for that Prince, Niklyudov, he is just a person whose conscience has not yet been extinguished. His saving Gedisha is only to relieve the pain in his conscience, it is entirely an act of self-redemption.</p>
<p>But what is the "Resurrection" of the China Traveling Theater like? Their sympathy for Gedisha is far less than that for Niklyudov. Almost all six acts are concentrated on Niklyudov. They write Niklyudov as the "soul" and "god" who saves Gedisha. They write Niklyudov's actions as not "self-redemption," but as saving Gedisha, and finally, they even portray Tolstoy as a supreme lover.</p>
<p>We cannot but point out such a distortion.</p>
<p>Originally, in order to accept literary heritage, it is perfectly legitimate to inject new life into previous masterpieces, but here, we only see distortion.</p>
<p>In order to focus on Niklyudov, in order to make Niklyudov the "god" who saves people's souls, there are unnecessary second and fourth acts.</p>
<p>Speaking of each act separately, Gedisha's character in the third act is also written too vaguely; in the fifth act, the change from the revolutionaries' abuse and anger to talking about love is also too disharmonious in terms of emotion.</p>
<p>As for the performance, the efforts of the China Traveling Theater are worthy of admiration, especially the lighting and set design. This is not just a so-called "technical sample," it is indeed done to a very commendable degree. However, in the third act, the light on the right seems too bright (plus a dim overhead light, the light on the right can be dispensed with), making the dark and dirty scene of the prison lose its authenticity.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, Tang Ruoge performed very hard, while Dai Ya seems to lack a grasp of the character. In terms of makeup, ten years have passed between the prologue and the first act, but the makeup still does not show that she has aged, which is something that should be noted.</p>
<p>"Resurrection" is the last play that the China Traveling Theater will perform in Shanghai this time; in Mr. Tang Huaiqiu's "Our Position and Hope", he tells us that the past was only "giving us a look at technical samples", and after this, they will advance to the second phase of work, performing some plays with "major significance that do not leave the era and do not leave the masses". We hope that in addition to rehearsing meaningful new scripts, he can also revise the plays that have been performed so that they "do not leave the era and do not leave the masses"; for example, "Resurrection" should find another script that is "suitable for the times and for the masses" to perform.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Chorus <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Biao</p>
<p>"Tell you," Director Wang said with authority. Two pairs of eyes widened. "The county magistrate said today that no matter what, you must learn this song. It's the chairman's favorite. Understand?"</p>
<p>"Yes!" A hundred or so voices shouted from below the stage in unison.</p>
<p>"Now, let's start singing again. One, two."</p>
<p>"The rooster crows – the dawn breaks"…</p>
<p>"No good! Xiao Cheng! The 'crows' must be sung higher! How come it's getting worse and worse, Zhao Debiao! Take the row standing in the back out, ten lashes each! See if you're putting your heart into it or not!" His face flushed red, he gripped the broken half of the beating stick and frantically knocked on the table.</p>
<p>"Yes!" Zhao Debiao snapped to attention and ran over to the policemen standing in the last row, waving his hand. They followed him out like docile sheep. In the corridor outside the door, each received ten lashes, and then they were brought back.</p>
<p>"Reporting, Director, ten lashes for each person." Zhao Debiao reported with a salute.</p>
<p>"That's how it is. If anyone is still not putting their damn heart into it, it's still ten lashes! Sing! One, two!" Before he finished speaking, the orderly, Little Li, burst in.</p>
<p>"Reporting, Director, the county magistrate is on the phone. He requests to speak with you," he said with a salute.</p>
<p>"Stand there and don't move. We'll talk when I get back."</p>
<p>"Yes," a chorus of voices replied. Their feet snapped to attention. Director Wang, fuming, walked out. The group of prisoners who had lost their freedom were left in the room. They watched the director's back as he turned through the door, and then the conversation began. However, it was always in a low voice, secretly. Only one slightly louder voice cursed:</p>
<p>"I've been in the army for over twenty years, and I've never experienced anything like this!"</p>
<p>"This is to give you a taste!" a voice replied.</p>
<p>"Eat, eat!" A burst of suppressed laughter.</p>
<p>"The Director has gone to the county government; we're temporarily dismissed," a patrol officer came in and said.</p>
<p>"Kid! You're bound to get shot!" Such a sentence echoed from the crowd pushing out. At this time, Director Wang was riding his bicycle just outside the bureau's gate. Two orderlies with boxed guns followed behind. Like a gust of wind, the three of them flew to the county government. The orderlies stopped in the courtyard, and Director Wang walked into the office alone. The county magistrate was talking to several section chiefs, seemingly not noticing someone had come in. He walked over and gave a salute, the county magistrate glanced at him, leaned his plump body forward, and signaled for him to sit down. He sat uneasily on the chair behind the county magistrate, listening silently.</p>
<p>"Even though the chairman doesn't care, you know, it's the face of our county. No matter what, you must take care of it. And you, Section Chief Liu," the county magistrate turned his head to a thin man sitting on the left and said. "How many schools will participate tomorrow? It would be ugly if there are too few. Think about how much education funding the county spends every year; it would be too outrageous! What? Fifteen schools? About two thousand students? That's it then. But, tell them, everyone must wear their uniforms. Those without uniforms are not allowed to join the parade. But, alas!" The county magistrate said hurriedly, stuttering slightly because he spoke too quickly. As he spoke, he took out a handkerchief from his waist and wiped his bald head, took a sip of tea, and continued:</p>
<p>"Whichever school is the most orderly, have them stand in the front row." After speaking, he stretched his back and suddenly realized that Director Wang was sitting behind him.</p>
<p>"I completely forgot about you. Too busy. How is your matter going?" The county magistrate's plump face, as red as a winter melon, showed a hint of a smile, as if to express his apologies.</p>
<p>"Everything has been done according to the magistrate's instructions, except for the song, that 'Morning Assembly Song.' They just can't seem to learn it."</p>
<p>"That won't do!" The county magistrate was so anxious he almost jumped up. "I told you, Director Wang, the chairman likes this song the most! Now! You!" He frantically scratched his scalp, the smile on his face long gone.</p>
<p>"I taught them with all my heart for half the afternoon, but those guys are just too stupid!" Director Wang stood up uneasily, looking at the county magistrate, not knowing what to do.</p>
<p>"Originally, I can't completely blame you. It was too rushed! We only received the call from the province this morning. You're too busy, and no one else can teach in your place. Okay, go back now, no matter what, you must teach them to sing it."</p>
<p>"Yes," Director Wang turned and went out. He grabbed his bicycle in the courtyard and jumped on it. Another gust of wind and he sped towards the Public Security Bureau. He didn't notice anything on the road, and even forgot to return the salute from the gate guard when he entered.</p>
<p>"Blow the whistle! Assembly in the auditorium!" He shouted as he got off his bike. The whistle sounded, and one by one, dark figures swirled into the auditorium. He was just about to follow them in when suddenly the office phone rang. He ran in and picked up the receiver.</p>
<p>"Oh! I'm Wang Zirui, what? The chairman isn't coming? There are foreign military attachés visiting. Yes, yes." He let out a relieved breath as he put down the receiver.</p>
<p>"Tell them, they don't need to learn the song," he said turning to the orderly in front of the door.</p>
<h3 id="e208">The Well <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Dongguang</p>
<p>The well next to the threshing ground is covered with stone slabs, and the windlass frame has also been removed. For many generations, the nearby residents have drunk the water from it. But now? The well mouth is tightly sealed, and a three-foot-high mud wall is built on the thick stone slabs. In the center of the wall, a small shrine, one foot square, has been dug out. A half-foot-high statue of the Well Dragon King sits inside. Days continue to crawl forward. Whenever the farmers go to fetch water three miles away from the river, they pass by the well mouth and invariably utter that curse:</p>
<p>"May that bitch be reborn as livestock in the next life, harming us!"</p>
<p>The one being cursed is a young girl who died a year ago. A year ago, in that sweltering month of May, the wheat hung with golden ears, swaying its lovely stalks in the fields under the caressing breeze, gradually ripening. The owner of this threshing ground, Mr. Tang, was also transporting cartload after cartload of glowing wheat sheaves from the highlands south of the village and from the leased land on the north bank of the river to this flat ground. The carts rumbled heavily through the village paths, wheat grains bursting open like pregnant bellies, scattered and falling into the wheel ruts. As soon as the carts entered the ground, many farmhands stood on the cart bodies, throwing large bundles to the edges of the ground. The elderly owner, holding a water pipe, sat under the shade of a tree watching, the water in the pipe bubbling and making a noise. He laughed heartily, watching the loyal men use large white wooden forks to pile the wheat heads like small mountains, many in a row, reflecting the scorching sun, shimmering, glowing like metal. The farmhands were also particularly happy at this time. Throughout the year's hard work, the master always fed them stale, musty rice, cornmeal infested with worms, and salted radishes riddled with maggots. Only during the wheat harvest could they eat as much freshly harvested wheat porridge or wheat cakes as they wanted.</p>
<p>One evening, the farmhands had all gone back to eat dinner, leaving only Mr. Tang's grandson to guard the threshing ground. In the evening breeze, mosquitoes hummed in the puddles by the well, and grayish-black bats hunted flying insects in the twinkling starlit sky. Everything was peaceful. In the distance, children sang a nursery rhyme:</p>
<p>Night bat, come to smoke, smoke my cigarette, don't give me money, scold you at your doorstep for three years...</p>
<p>He spread a mat on the open threshing ground, lying quietly, waving a banana leaf fan at the flying mosquitoes and the sweat beads seeping from his skin. Suddenly, behind that short wall of wheat sheaves, there was a rustling sound. He quietly arched his back and walked over. At the far east side of the wheat stack, there was a figure pulling at the wheat sheaves. He crept forward like a cat. By the time the girl stealing wheat realized someone was catching her, the young man, chuckling coldly, had already grabbed her arm. The girl dropped the wheat sheaves in fright. In the darkness of the night, her eyes shone with pleading tears as she looked at him. Gradually, she knelt down weakly, begging:</p>
<p>"Let me go, I won't dare to come again."</p>
<p>The young man held her tightly. His energy was a little stimulated. He carefully looked at the girl's attire and the way she spoke. He felt that she did not resemble a local. He asked:</p>
<p>"Who are you from?"</p>
<p>"I'm... from the wheat-gathering boat." Her voice trembled slightly as she said, "Over there, my home, was all washed away by the flood. Sir, please let me go. I will never steal... steal again."</p>
<p>The girl cried, appearing uncontrollably sad. The young man frowned. Suddenly, he loosened his hand and said:</p>
<p>"Go away."</p>
<p>The girl turned around abruptly, walking hurriedly, wiping away tears without daring to look up.</p>
<p>"Hey, you come back, you take back two wheat..."</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, the girl twisted to the north in fright, afraid that the person would turn back and catch her again. In a panic, she didn't pay attention to what was in front of her, stepped on empty space, and fell into the open mouth of the well. She screamed sharply. The young man on the threshing ground heard the loud "thump" of the well water. He ran to the well mouth in a panic and looked down. The poor child was struggling in the darkness of the well water. He didn't know what to do. He couldn't go in and rescue her himself, and he was afraid that others would know that he had scared her down there. He was anxious. After a while, the cries from the well were slowly swallowed by the water. He ran home in a frenzy of pain.</p>
<p>The next day at dawn, a water drawer discovered the female corpse. From then on, the well was sealed by the well owner, who said that someone had broken the "feng shui" of his family's house and that the well could not be reopened for sixty years.</p>

<p>— By Gu Wenzong</p>
<p>Jinghong: (Interrupting, asking) Is it that "My Darling I Love You" song?</p>
<p>Liya: (Smiling) That's right, it's that My Darling I Love You song!</p>
<p>He whistled for a while, and I ignored him. Later, he actually started singing,</p>
<p>Jinghong: Was he singing that My Darling I Love You song too?</p>
<p>Liya: No, he was singing "Teach Me How Can I Forget You." I still remember the last two lines of the song (sings the last two lines of "Teach Me How Can I Forget You," please refer to the "Xi Shi" song collection composed by Mr. Chen Gexin).</p>
<p>(After singing, Jinghong and Liya laugh at each other, saying amidst laughter)</p>
<p>Liya: (Laughing) I think this person is simply a bit "crazy"!</p>
<p>Jinghong: I think he's a "pervert"!</p>
<p>Liya: I wouldn't love this kind of person even if you killed me! Look at his twisted attitude, his meek and submissive voice, it doesn't express the beauty of a strong young man at all. He's still an effeminate man of the eighteenth-century Jia Baoyu type! I get annoyed just looking at him! Especially, he's a Suzhou person, and what I hate most are Suzhou people who lack any strength!</p>
<p>Jinghong: Maybe this Suzhou person is special?</p>
<p>Liya: Then I dare to say: he's not a special Suzhou person. Just from the fact that he likes to look at women, he is definitely not a special Suzhou person, and he's still the most useless kind of Suzhou person!</p>
<p>Jinghong: How can you tell that he's the most useless kind of Suzhou person?</p>
<p>Liya: The most useless Suzhou people mostly like to steal glances at women with improper eyes, they also use improper means to associate with women, and they even use despicable methods to play with women.</p>

<p>The Master said, "At fifteen, I set my heart on learning; at thirty, I stood firm; at forty, I had no doubts; at fifty, I knew the decrees of Heaven; at sixty, my ear was obedient; at seventy, I could follow my heart's desire without transgressing the boundaries of what was right."</p>
<p>Meng Yizi asked about filial piety. The Master said, "Do not violate." Fan Chi was driving the chariot. The Master told him, saying, "Mengsun asked me about filial piety, and I answered him, 'Do not violate.'" Fan Chi said, "What does that mean?" The Master said, "When alive, serve them according to the rites; when dead, bury them according to the rites; sacrifice to them according to the rites."</p>
<p>Meng Wubo asked about filial piety. The Master said, "Parents are only concerned about their children's illness." Ziyou asked about filial piety. The Master said, "Nowadays, filial piety is said to be the ability to provide for them. But even dogs and horses can be provided for. Without respect, what is the difference?" Zixia asked about filial piety. The Master said, "It is difficult to have a pleasant countenance. When there is work to be done, the disciples take on the labor; when there is wine and food, the elders partake. Is this considered filial piety?" The Master said, "I speak with Hui all day long, and he does not disagree, as if he were stupid. But when he retires and I examine his private conduct, I find that he is indeed sufficient not to be stupid."</p>

<p>Opening Verse: "Tai Zhen's Jade Demise"</p>
<p>Since ancient times, beautiful women have had unfortunate fates. The news of the lovely lady's departure has spread, her soul now gone. During her life, she endured the calamities of the mortal world. Even after death, it is difficult to find her form. At that time, the situation in the border regions was precarious, the rebellion began at Lushan. Flames of war filled the passes, approaching Chang'an at an alarming rate. Therefore, the Emperor was forced to flee to Sichuan, protected by the imperial guards. But General Chen Yuanli feigned obedience and refused to proceed. The soldiers rioted, and the sound of killing filled the air. First, the young maternal uncles and aunts were killed, and then it was said that the hatred would not be appeased until Yang Guifei was beheaded. The emperor listened, the army's morale changed. Heaven and earth turned upside down, the gods were shocked. The Tang emperor was left helpless, his heart in turmoil. He wanted to execute the beauty first, ignoring the previous vows made in the Palace of Eternal Life. The imperial troops were forceful and violent, their faces fierce like tigers. Although he was the noble Emperor, he could not rescue the beauty. Alas, Tai Zhen, with her jade-like and flower-like appearance, was strangled to death. In an instant, her jade shattered, her fragrance disappeared, and her soul was severed. The purple jade turned into smoke. Time stretched on, but the beauty was gone forever. In the end, I, a stranger, failed you. Don't say that the country's affairs are more important than the beauty's life. Alas, the beauty died under the pear tree, her flower-like life no more. Today, I offer a cup of wine in commemoration, mourning her soul with the broken flowers and waning moon. The cuckoo cries blood for her sad fate, and the wax candle burns to ashes as tears flow. Making me unable to cry out my broken heart.</p>

<p>In the past two years, Hollywood producers, encouraged by the success of literary films, have continuously produced many works. David O. Selznick, the producer of major films such as "David Copperfield," "A Tale of Two Cities," "Dinner at Eight," and "Little Women," has once again brought Frances Hodgson Burnett's famous novel "Little Lord Fauntleroy" to the screen. The protagonists of this film are Freddie Bartholomew, the talented child star from "David Copperfield," and the long-absent screen beauty Dolores Costello, playing Mrs. Errol. One is a pure and innocent child, and the other is a benevolent and charitable lady, a perfect match. This film is United Artists' grand offering for this year, and it is safe to say that it will soon be released at the Grand Theater.</p>

<p>The old veterans of the theater world excitedly thought about going on stage to show off their skills. Unfortunately, Carlton had already been rented to an Englishman, who had decided to send craftsmen to repair the theater that day. Thus, the good show of a veteran gathering was easily dismissed.</p>
<p>Since the matter was unsuccessful, let's reveal the name of this senior, the well-known Hong Shen.</p>
<p>Originally, everyone was very happy. Dai Ya was excitedly planning to perform five plays that night. Tang Huaiqiu also said that he would not take the money from the sales that day. Naturally, if the performance was successful, there might be an after-party the next day as well.</p>
<p>However, Hong Shen went back to Suzhou because he did not hear back by twelve o'clock the day before yesterday. Our good fortune is truly too shallow!</p>
