<h3>常熟的農村（下）</h3>
<p>— 晉用</p>
<p>農民的生活</p>
<p>常熟的農民生活，可以分爲三方面看：在東南鄉，因爲都是水田，所以農民個個要下田去學習戽水和揷秧等許多技術，男的和女的同樣要具備灣這種本領。所以，一個女子在出嫁之先，男家一定要問問會不會做「生活」？就是，能不能下田去和男子一般的赤足露腿的　工作。</p>
<p>在西北鄉，因爲土地略高，河港較少，所以種植的而積，稻棉各半，田間的工作，也就複雜起來了。大體上講，男子專管水田裏的工作，女子專管棉田裏的工作，當男子在唱秧歌的時候，女了却在另一處棉田裏鋤</p>
<p>另在濱江的沙洲一帶，農民生活又是一番景象，因爲該處種的棉田多，所以農民的力量，都集中於植棉。該處常罹水災和風災，農民生活較上兩鄉爲苦，但逢到熟年，一種歡欣鼓舞的氣象也是似處所少見的了。</p>
<p>天堂和地獄</p>
<p>常熟的紳士站在雲端裏享受大堂上的淸福；而許多的農民在地獄裏痛苦呻吟。</p>
<p>常熟的人口過密，所以土地的耕種，每戶也占得很少，依作者家鄉的情形而說：—西北鄉—每戶平均在五畝與十畝之間，倘然一家有自耕田十畝，已算是鄉間小康之家；有五十畝的已是一鄕的小財主了。五口之家，種著十畝田，平均每畝田收白米二石，共得十石，要繳掉租米的六石至十石。剩下的米，供一家五口的食用，有時還嫌不足。至於種籽，肥料的錢，非借　是無法應付的了。五口之家，老老小小辛苦了一年，結果只能餬口，年成好些，還可收回些種籽和肥料成本，倘遇荒歉、還要挨餓呢。在這種情形之下，農民是已進人飢餓線上，要他們改良農具，佈種優良品種，整潔衛生，那更是奢望了。</p>
<p>一般農民爲了金融的不能流通，沒有錢購買種籽和肥料，往往不能及時耕植，而减低了收成。有的農民卽可借到幾十塊錢，至少是每月分起息；還要加上種種手續費，所以，農民一欠了債，在高利之下，是無法可以淸償的。</p>
<p>近年來荒歉，飢餓，貧困，更使農民失掉了忠厚馴順的德性，他們已無所典質，無處借貸了，所以對於地主們發生了欠租和要求减租的舉動，地主家裏倉廳的門雖然開著，可是還租的人却寥寥無幾，征租人的威嚇，衙役的捕人，沒有用，農民們一長串的押進看守所，去年和前年看守所裏曾經押過幾百個佃農，但是、石子裏榨不出油」來，農民的血汗已經乾枯了。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>軍備擴張的狂潮</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>前日國民社所傳日內瓦電訊書根據國聯一九三六年軍備年鑑的統計。最近世界各國用於軍備的費用。已較前更鉅。一九三五年全世界軍備費用的總額。共達五、四〇〇百萬元。（美金）在一九三四年。只有四、九〇〇百萬元。在一九一三年。還只有二、五〇〇百萬元。可見最近世界各國軍備擴張的在潮。實已到達了人類歷史上的最高峯。</p>
<p>這樣軍備擴張的最後結果。無疑的是一個國際間的大戰爭。而這决大戰爭的慘酷程度。單就各國現有軍備的數量上看。也可以斷定要較以前的大戰超過無數倍。但是明知道有這樣慘酷的災禍放在前面。爲什麽許多國家要像盲人瞎馬。一直闖向那恐怖的深淵呢。在戰爭中。最遭受慘刦的還是無辜的人民。爲什麽世界各國的億萬人民。在這樣大禍臨頭的時候。還不想一些積極的挽救辦法呢。這兩個問題。在我們半殖民地的人民。在我們有許多同胞。已經被戰爭狂的侵略者踐踏着屠宰着的中國人民。是更其値得關心的。</p>
<p>目前各國擴張軍備的狂潮。是從一九三一年開始的。一九三一年滿洲事變發生之後。太平洋的均勢完全搖動。一方面侵略者的日本盡力羅掘所有的資財。以支持它的侵略的機構。另一方面。其他太平洋沿岸的國家。爲了本身的利害關係。也急速加强了本身的軍備。在一九三三年。希特勒攫得了德國的政權。他的軍事法西斯的政策。一面把德意志全國造成一個大兵營。一面又把戰後維持着歐洲國際均勢的凡爾賽和的。一步步加以摧毀。結果整個歐洲被戰爭威脅着。各國都不得不爲着本身的安全。加强本身的防禦了。在一九三五年。同屬於法西斯勢力的意大利。又不顧一切國際條約的束縛。發動了侵阿的戰爭。這戰爭一直延長到今年。在非洲地中海和南歐的巴爾幹。到處撒布下軍事衝突的種子。對於各國的軍備擴張。又給與一個强烈的刺激。到最近。西班牙戰爭中幾個法西斯國家的干涉。中歐鬥爭中德意的携手。以至東西兩大軍事冒險國家日德的訂立同盟的消息。在軍備擴張的在潮中。都足以表示國際緊張到了非常的强度。戰爭有一觸卽發之勢了。</p>
<p>不過。就實際情形講。現在除了日德意幾個軍事法西斯國家以外。一般的國家都不希望戰爭的爆發。但是對於迫近在眼前的戰禍的防止。許多國家單從增强本身的軍備着手。而忘却了聯合和平的勢力。以抵制戰爭狂的侵略者。則顯然還嫌不够。所以。國聯成了一個徒有其名的機關。集體安全制度受到了接二連三的打擊。現在各國軍備費用的膨大不已。對於各國的民生也增加了無限的痛苦。這樣再發展到將來空前的大戰。眞是人類歷史上最大慘劇的時候了。</p>
<p>顯然的。現在世界軍備擴張的在潮。正表示着各國對於和平防戰的努力還沒有充分的認識。祗有從集體和平的路上努力。人類才能减少從慘酷的戰爭中所受到的痛苦。</p>

<h3>德奧談判結束　經濟同盟將復活　德以軍用品換奧物產　下月初再議訂新商約</h3>
<p>（柏林）奧外長施米德博士來此、爲四年來奧國閣員第一次正式報聘德國、今日已完成其使命、據公報宣稱、施博士曾與德外長牛賴特晤談兩國政治經濟文化數次、雙方意見融洽、並决定爲增進雙方貿易起見、擬於十二月七日在維也納開議締結新商的、博士此次來德、乃謀與德國成立經濟妥協、俾奧國大規模重整軍備之舉、得以實現、現議定德國應購買奧國過剩牛乳與木料、此二物皆爲德國所急需、奧國則向德國購買軍用飛機坦克車重砲、前者因德國欲以低價購得奧貨、致談判陷於僵局云、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）奧國外長史密特來德國聘問、頃已公畢、本日偕德國駐奧公使巴本、同乘飛機返維也納、外長牛拉脫及希特勒元首之代表總理公署秘書長梅斯納、均到機塲送別、史密特於啟行前、發表宣言、謂「此次來柏林之結果、益行證明德奧兩國近年雖略有齟齬、然兩國種族之團結、絕不因之而破裂」、史密特繼表示對於元首希特勒、航空部長戈林、外長牛拉脫、殷勤欵待、不勝感謝、並謂「賴外長牛拉脫之友好態度、及其豐富之外交經騐、吾人竟獲提出德奧兩國問多項懸案、交換意見、並就原則上及最近將來如何實際解决之各節、商得共同之見解、而允要者、則吾人此次晤面、竟覓得增强德奧協定之方法、並準備更爲圓滿之前途、德國元首希特勒承認奧國建設事業之廣大成就、而奧國對於德意志謀在全世界樹立榮譽自由與公道所從事之行動、亦芸表同情、余於十六年前、曾就學柏林大學、德國由戰敗以至復興、其間起伏升沉、余均目擊其事　最後則謂德奧恊定、實爲日耳曼民族全體進步之一種準備」云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>瑪德里一帶　雨雪載道戰事沉寂　兩軍僅用步槍機關槍射擊　叛軍復英允擴大中立區域</h3>
<p>瑪德里　瑪德里今日降雨、視綫不明、叛軍飛機因未續來轟炸、京城四週軍事活動、遂不如過去數日之猛烈、居民趁此戰事暫停之機會、均忙於淸除堵塞街中之廢物、以便消防隊與救護員、於下决飛機矗炸時、得執行工作、頹垣殘壁有傾圯危險者、均推倒之、彈穴則塡補之、瓦礫則糞除之、難民携家具逃赴安全區域、絡繹於途、樓範監獄附近之戰事、時作時輟、但雙方幾全用來福槍機關槍互擊、間或聞有砲聲、各處陣地未有顯著變動、瑪德里北部瓜達拉瑪山間、與格利多斯山地、均有大風雪、數處之雪、深達二十吋、因是戰事不得不暫停（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>亞維拉　本社訪員特訊、瑪德里附郭一帶、本日氣候突轉寒冷、加之天雨不化、國民軍不得不停化進攻、僅用重砲向瑪德里城中心區及南區轟擊、並乘機鞏固陣地、此間國民軍當局、希望入晚氣候轉佳、俾得繼續採取攻勢、至於政府軍方面、雖曾企圖反攻、但僅屬局部行動、而並非通盤作戰計畫、總之、目前戰事形勢、係由國民軍取主動地位、則固毫無疑義也、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>瑪德里　此間飯館今日因京城與外省交通阻塞、糧食來源行爲斷絕、一致張貼「貨物售完」之廣吿、美聯社記者目擊多數婦孺、因不堪飢餓、在街頭巷角、呼號啼泣、（二十日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）西班牙國民軍政府頒袖弗朗哥將軍、因國民軍進攻瑪德里、久而不下、爰乃揚言、守軍若不於本日午夜之前、獻城納降、卽當發滅全城云、英法兩國當局、關於此事、曾於本日竟日進行磋商、結果决定由英國政府訓令駐西班牙大使邱爾頓爵士、速與國民軍當局再度交涉、務令西國內戰、尤其是瑪德里戰事、合於人道云、（廿日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>蒲爾哥斯　國民軍當局、頃通知英國政府、謂國民軍政府、已决定擴大瑪德里城東北之原有中立區域、而將英美大使館及其他若干國家使館區域、包括在內、在該中立區域內、國民軍决不發砲轟擊之、（二十一哈瓦斯）</p>
<h3>英對西班牙　繼續中立　艾登外相演說　不願火上加油</h3>
<p>（倫敦）外相艾登今晚在里明頓演說、切實聲明英政府决恪守不干涉西班牙內戰協定、並謂今有應爲消防隊者、反於火上灌油、以張其滔、故消防隊全體實無棄其職責、而使歐洲爲一洪爐之理、英政府之决議、實屬正當、故吾人責當往持之云、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）艾登决述及一般外交政策，則謂「英國反對在國際方面造成互相敵對之集團、吾人所蘄求者、在與一切國家共同合作已耳、有人以爲各國必須採取相當之政制、方可參加國際制度、而共同合作、此種見解、可謂狂悖之至、當知吾國軍隊、將來决不用以參加侵略戰爭、但法國與比利時、倘未經挑釁、而受他國侵略之時、英國軍隊如出於必要、自當遵照現有義務、用以防衛法比兩國之國土、又若西歐安全問題、經簽訂公約、獲得解决以後、德國倘未經挑釁、而遭簽的國之一、加以侵略時、英國軍隊固亦可用以防衛德國也」云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>德方否認簽訂　日德軍事密約　德國重視對華友誼　對俄作戰得不償失　共同防赤則當別論</h3>
<p>（柏林）關於上海最近傳來消息、德國駐日大使曾鄭重聲明德國重視對華友誼、並謂德日間並未成立任何協定、海通社記者從此間有權威方面得悉，德國並未與日本簽訂何種協定、至於外間所傳德日擬訂軍事協定、亦屬不確云、（二十日國民電）</p>
<p>德國海通社東方經理符厚斯、日來屢見報載日德兩國締結秘密軍事同盟之說、甚至外間對共內容竟亦傳說紛紜、莫衷一是、實則此事全屬子虛烏有之無稽讕言、且爲中傷中德兩國友誼之惡意宣傳、茲特根據事實、負責否認其事、並詳述其原委如次、</p>
<p>在復興之中國、與希特勒氏導領下新興之德意志國間、其日趨敦睦鞏固之友誼、某方不欲使之順利進展、每以散佈謠言、妄造不符事實之記載、向中國民衆、對其熱摯之歐洲友邦德意志國、從事離間、</p>
<p>吾人於近兩年中、讀到此項消息、已不下數十次之多、最近報章又有記載、謂德國與日本締結軍事同盟、德國與日本訂立反蘇協定、德國以軍火交換滿洲之大豆諸說、</p>
<p>此類愚蠢顛倒是非之手段、余認爲係對中國民衆之英明、施以侮辱、蓋此項不負責任謠言之散播者、並未計及中國閱報者之自行判斷能力、而希望藉此千篇一律、一再出現之僞造消息、使中國民衆對共誠實友邦之信任觀念、逐漸消失、然此輩殊難如願以償、因中國民衆認識極確、能以判斷何者爲眞、如者爲僞也、對於此類之中傷事伴、德國迄幾以不値一笑目之、吾人至今深知中德間之友誼並不因此有所損傷、蓋眞實之友邦、係經過自行考慮之後、而始締結者、外來蜚語、絕不能使彼此長有所懷疑彷徨也、人事經騐事實閱歷、盡人皆知、母庸贅言、</p>
<p>余此次辭而闢之、其動機蓋一如私人之友誼然、如遇自己爲友人所懷疑時、當必吿友日、「他人圖謀破壞吾人間之友誼、但汝識余而余亦深知汝能信余、」對諸報載消息、今試問「德國與日本締有軍事同盟乎、」其答語及其事理上之昭示、只能應之曰「無」</p>
<p>日本與德遠隔重洋、其間並有綿亘萬里之蘇俄爲之阻隔、再以德日對蘇俄之戰事眞果發生言之、則德人所遇與周旋者、將爲世界數字最巨之軍隊、應付部份幾及其十分之九、而日本則僅十分之一弱耳、矧蘇俄全部之價値、尙不及德國一兵一卒所流之血、吾人更試觀歐洲地圖、並可知德國歷盡如何艱難、始能於最近將凡爾賽條約桎梏、擺脫掙斷、且於此更可得悉兩項事實、卽（一）迄至今日、歐洲尙有反德集團、德國如對蘇俄發生戰事、則此項集團定必起而襲其後、致使德國腹背受敵、（二）吾人之領袖及國務總理希特勒氏之政策極爲簡明、卽「德國願於和平中、與世界共同生活」是也、</p>
<p>詎料現竟有人　謂爲根據此方或彼方消息、德日間之軍事盟的乃實有其事云云、試問德日在軍事盟的中、雙方能作若何之貢獻乎、德人如欲進攻蘇俄、則須通過處於德蘇間之各國、此爲德國東鄰任何國所不能許可者、德蘇間之距離、正不下於上海至甘肅省間之航錢也、</p>
<p>德日締結軍事同盟、卽在太平洋上亦毫無理由、蓋吾人深知此項同盟、將置德日兩國與英國之世界政策處於對立地位、抑吾人在太平洋上另有其他利益、使吾人絕不能在遠東方面行使軍事政策、對此容後另文述之、余謹重複言之日、「德國與日本决不締結軍事同盟、此項同盟在德國國策或日本政策中、亦决無存在之希望與可能、</p>
<p>茲更有人謂、德國與日本訂有反蘇協定者、余答曰「反蘇恊定與德日反莫斯科之軍事同盟、並無差異、」其理由業如上述、茲不重贅、但爲防止第三國際圖謀世界革命之共同防禦行爲、則殊與前者逈異、吾人以神聖嚴重之態度、慨切言之、國家固有之文明、將因赤化而悉遭摧毀、俄國革命事跡、歷歷在目、可爲殷鑑、</p>
<p>吾人賴領袖希特勒氏之力、歐洲中部始從赤色危險中、獲得解放、試觀今日之西班牙、千百無辜之被覊作質者、竟在蘇俄導領之下、慘遭殺戮、、吾人於此當可瞭然、處於第三國際下之國家、其將來爲如何矣、</p>
<p>試更就中國言之、余昔嘗漫遊江西全省、舉目所及、伏屍遍野、田舍荒蕪、悽慘之狀、不忍卒覩、何以然哉、此皆係在「錘鐮刀」旗幟下共黨之所爲者也、中國在人口上之損失、何祗百萬、其間安居樂業之農民、自食其力之工人、以及文士學子慘受荼毒者、其數何可勝計、共黨牢不可破之政策、卽在煽動中國之數部份、從事內戰、阻擾中央政府之建設事業、並使其難以全力從事於保障國家之榮譽、然莫斯科之花言巧語、終未收效、而共黨固仍爲中國之死敵也、余茲憶及新疆、蘇俄在該省豈非已經蹬明、其目的乃爲使全省脫離祖國版圖乎、</p>
<p>茲更就歐洲而言、當一九三三年希特勒氏初執德國政權之時、新德意志之敵人、忽發明其對蘇俄有價値之友誼、德國毫未置意、依然行其趨向民族自由之路、但迄至今日、正歐洲民族互相瞪視、而覺蘇俄將使之淪於滅亡、及蘇俄與國日趨叛離、則德國對於認識歐洲及全世界赤化危險之各國、自必逐漸居於導領地位、迨亦勢所必然、德國對蘇俄之防禦陣綫、自非僅限於歐洲方面、德國立塲、爲中國當局所素悉、卽對日本、德國亦嘗將其對於赤化危險之意見、詳爲解釋、並闡明反對共產主義爲世界革命哲學之共同準則、但除此之外、絕未擬及他事或成立任何事實、日本力事籌謀俾使赤化毒燄、遠離其國境者、對於我人已有滿意之表示、吾人於此更須特別鄭重聲明者、卽德國對於俄國國民、並無敵意、吾人希望此偉大民族、終有一日、能擺脫其赤化之束縛、復歸與其他民族和平相處、</p>
<p>此外更具有危險性者、卽吾敵人所造之讕言、謂德國以軍火交換滿洲之大豆是也、余對之謹答之曰、此乃夢人囈語、捕風捉影之妄談耳、</p>
<p>滿洲係數十年來中國出產黃豆之唯一部份、吾人昔日卽係中國黃豆之最大顧主、試思德國係工業國、雖國境僅及中國一大省、然擁有七千萬衆之人民、德國城市居民爲數至巨、其所需之脂肪、德國不克充份供給、因乃興設專門製造脂防之工業、其大部原料則爲黃豆、華北之不幸糾紛事件、不僅影響中國本身、且亦使仰給滿洲黃豆之德國、蒙受不利、如無黃豆、吾人至今仍然不克自行維持、更因外匯關係、吾人不得不以電廠機器發動機藥品等物、以交換黃豆、滿洲境內中國農民、因德國運輸黃豆出口之舉、在生活上又獲一層保障、在中國他部並無大量黃豆之產植、故我人於他處不克購買也、</p>
<p>或謂德國有以軍械或火藥供給滿洲者、更係虛偽妄語、沒有其事、卽證明德國此舉實反對中國也、日本擁有巨大之軍械及火藥工業、此舉由日方爲之、或尙能自圓其說、</p>
<p>卽就事實而言、如德國與日本果有所謂同盟或恊定者、則德之對滿、自必予以承認、事實俱在、德國固未嘗承認「滿洲國」也、</p>
<p>更就事理而論、德國正向中國發展巨大市塲、而於尙未完全成就之際、亦斷不至貿然有此項在悖行動、以自絕其前途、</p>
<p>中國之幸福、能使德國同臻幸福之境、蓋中國日趨高漲之購買力、能使德國工人得有工作、獲有工資、德國亦得向中國購運其出產品、此亦卽中國農工衣食之所依賴、德國各大工業需用中國之原料、而中國之工業亦多需用德國之機器、德國其何故欲將此攸關生命與中國人民間之友誼、自行摧毀乎、太平洋和平係德國在此間之唯一政策、吾人爲經營商業需要和平、並爲生存需要商業、吾人旣需要和平及商業、則吾人對於一切事件、凡足使吾人前途及商業趨入危險之境者、自絕不欲參加其問、不待智者而喩、中德兩國、在復興上均尙有悠久及艱難之歲月、極願兩國民族、各以全力、本其已往歷史、以及眞實友誼、而能共同合作也、（二十一日國民）</p>
<h3>日本準備與德　締結文化恊定　防止第三國際威脅　本月底下月初簽字</h3>
<p>（南京）關於柏林傳來日本與德國間卽將締結文化協定之消息、日外務省當局今日承認、日本有準備簽訂該項協定之章向、但謂不僅限於德國、亦將與其他各國簽訂該項恊定云、關於此點、外務省曾發表宣言曰、目前外交母須僅限於政洽貿易問題、文化提携亦所需要、日本現不僅欲與某一特定國家締結文化協定、但亦願與他國簽訂之、截至現時止、已訂文化協定之國、計爲德·奧·西班牙·阿根廷·四國、以交換學者學生藝術家等爲主要條欵、日本似將締結此項恊定、但非僅限於德國也云、上述宣言、頗有注意之價値、蓋外務省發言人廿一日晨曾公開發表、日本因鑒於第三國際之國際組織、故現將與對第三國際感有同樣感脅之共他各强國、從事組織共同陣綫之政策云、今晨該發言人復重申此說、聞日德在此種精神下之文化協定、或將於十一月杪或十二月初、在柏林正式簽字云、（廿一日中央社電）</p>
<h3>德日恊定事件　俄不滿日解釋　國內共產主義　何須他國鎭壓</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）塔斯社從可靠方面得到消息、蘇聯駐日大使優里涅夫十一月十九日曾訪問日外相有田、通知蘇聯政府認定有田本月十六日關於德日恊定性質對優氏所作解釋、不能滿意、優氏聲明、蘇聯政府之意見、以爲德政府乃需日本警察援助、而日政府亦需德警察援助、以鎭壓各該國內之共產主義、並需要締結國際協定以資實行、此種理由實難令人相信、優氏並云、此項反共產主義恊定、當不過係另一日德協定之假面具、而該協定將不被公佈、其目的乃係共同對待第三國、因此、優氏云渠已受權聲明此項協定將嚴重妨害蘇日邦交、對於此項聲明、有田含混其辭、未作答復、（二十日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>朝鮮邊境　治安維持費約八萬元</h3>
<p>（東京）日本政府以討伐「滿洲國」內兵匪日有進步、爲維持朝鮮國境附近一帶之治安起見、决由朝鮮總督府特別會計剩餘金中支出七萬九千九百九十元、經日皇勅裁、廿一日以官報公布之、（二十一日同盟電）</p>
<h3>日作家米田　反對同盟　謂與日不利</h3>
<p>（東京）引起世界各方面極端震驚之日德同盟消息、雖經日德兩國之吾認、但日德文化協定卽將簽訂之消息、又已披露、此間一般人對於該項恊定、是否確限於文化範圍、頗滋疑竇、而各報卽對於文化協定一事、亦隻字不提、允使疑慮益深、所可令人注意者、厥爲著名國際問題批評家米田實在十二月號日本評論上發表一文、提出反對日德締結同盟之理由三項、略謂、（一）反共雖爲日德之共同目標、但兩國距離過遠、與夫兩國實際利益之迥異、日本對歐洲問題、自以不過問爲宜、蓋若因同盟之關係、而投入歐洲多事之漩渦、殊不値得、（二）德國之目的在烏克蘭、日本苟與德國締結同盟、則該方面設有戰事發生、自需要日本之參加、然此固與日本絕對無利、（三）德蘇爭執旣爲不可避免之事、日蘇苟發生戰事、德國自必加入、故日本無與德國締結同盟之需要、米田氏雖認爲無須締結同盟、使日本受參加戰爭之束縛、但對於與德國合作一層、並不表示反對、卽關於特定問題、如有相互諮詢之必要時、自不妨互求諒解、觀於上文、可知日德同盟之討論、最近日見重要、大有構成日本外交政策之趨勢、（二十日中央電）</p>
<h3>日設滿洲興業銀行　統制偽國金融　資本三千萬元　富田擔任總裁</h3>
<p>（南京）對滿事務局發表、關於整備「滿洲國」之金融機關、曾由日滿兩國政府研究决定設立滿洲興業銀行、買收朝鮮銀行（關東州內除外）之在滿各店及滿洲銀行正隆銀行之在滿各店之營業全部、進行協議後、各方面均諒解國策之重要性、協力之結果、已圓滿解决、日內可以實現、滿洲興業銀行、爲「滿洲國」特殊銀行、資本金國幣三千萬元、先收一半、（「滿洲國」政府及朝鮮銀行各出資一半）、除一般銀行業務外、兼營長期金融業務、以謀一般金融之圓滑、同時爲開發各種產業之故、以供給必要之長期的低利的資金爲使命、且爲取得資金之故、有發行已繳資本金十五倍債券之特權、如在外國發行債券、由「滿洲國政府保瞪支付本利與滿洲中央銀行、其使命自然不同、深期兩行之營業分野、漸决調整、互相協力、各達成其使命、俾無遺憾、朝鮮銀行從來雖於日本之對滿國策上負重要之任務、然此次除關東州外、在滿支店全部買與興業銀行、故今後可爲姊妹銀行、保持協調共謀發展、但朝鮮銀行之兌換券、自然不能再在「滿洲國」內發行、本銀行大體十二月上旬設立、接收朝鮮·滿洲·正隆·各銀行之業務、預定明年一月上旬開業、（二十一日同盟電）</p>

<h3>孫科暢談南行觀感　贊許桂省組織惟金融尙待整理　粵省諸事進步社會亦較前安定</h3>
<p>中央社云、立法院長孫科、經中央推派、於上月二十一日、偕同立委李文範·梁寒操·傅秉常·謝保樵·等南下、參加胡故主席國葬禮典、旋卽分赴桂湘等地、遊覽名勝、業於二十日午倦遊返京、當日由京偕同粵綏靖公署駐京辦事處主任鄧剛、乘機飛抵此間、於二十一日晨十時、在哥倫比亞路私寓、接見各報社新聞記者、暢談此次南下經過、</p>
<p>白將北上</p>
<p>據孫氏談、本人於參加胡先生國葬典禮後、便道折赴桂湘等省遊歷、在桂林留四天、曾訪李宗仁·白崇禧·諸氏、白氏入京日期、尙未决定、大的桂省復員事宜完全辦竣後、卽可北上、總之白氏入京、僅係時間問題、桂省此次動員人數、的達三十萬人以上、故辦理復員、頗費時日、</p>
<p>桂省特點</p>
<p>孫氏對桂者地方組織、深表贊許、且謂可稱爲中國模範省、足供全國借鏡、組織之特點、其顯著者、爲民團、民團組織、十家爲一甲、一百六十家爲一村、村上爲鄕、鄕上為縣、全省電話四達、省府有令、可於二小時內、用電話通知全省各縣鄉村、全省敎育、亦有進步、每一村上、至少有一小學校、校長由村長兼、同時村長兼民團指揮、全省共有二萬餘村、至於桂省金融、市上流通者仍爲桂幣、與法幣比較、須加貼水、自加五至加七不等、所以金融尙待整理、</p>
<p>粵事進步</p>
<p>孫氏繼談、自粵政奠定後、該省軍事·民政·財政·等、較前有明顯之進步、至於粵省社會情形、亦較前安定、物價雖較前提高、出口貨品、則日見增加、總之、粵省百種事業均在努力推進中、想不久將再見明顯之進步、</p>
<p>綏遠事件</p>
<p>孫氏對緩遠事件、相信於短期內、終可肅淸匪患、關於市上盛傳之德日同盟問題、孫氏對此、僅謂德日同盟之說、現尙不能决共必無、一旦果如所傳、成諸事實、敢料英法美間之關係、將更有增加密切之可能云、</p>

<h3>上海之搪瓷業　（上海工商業槪况之卅八）</h3>
<p>— 中國徵主編</p>
<p>一，概述搪瓷製品在吾人日常用品中所估之地位已日見重要，例如飲食用之盌盤菜格，洗滌用之大小盆桶，以及常見之招牌匾額，多半已皆爲搪瓷製品。按搪瓷製品與我國往時之瓷器，其不同乃在館者係以鐵片製坯，後者係以泥土製坯，故堅脆之程度頗有上下。至其表面所搪之瑯粉，實與吾國瓷器無異。</p>
<p>搪瓷製品之原料較爲簡單，主要者僅爲瑯粉與鐵皮兩種。瑯粉過去均購自日本，嗣後日人在滬所創辦之和田瑯粉秞藥廠，亦提供一大部份，迨至華商益豐，中華，鑄豐各搪瓷廠相繼自製瑯粉以後，此項原料始不受日人之操縱。惟製造瑯粉之原料如長石黏土等，大都仍賴日本，實爲美中不足。長石與黏土，我國雖有出產，　甚少開採，徒藏於自然界中，故吾人今後尙須努力採掘此項原料之原料，方能謀民挨搪瓷業之眞正獨立。至於鐵皮一項，因係重工業製品，我國至今仍難自產自給，其有待於吾人之努力，自更必要。</p>

<h3>西聯足球甲組　曁南二次勝利克西捕　上半時一比一結果為四比二　今日愛華戰臘克斯</h3>
<p>昨日西聯足球甲組、暨南二次獲得勝利、以四比二擊敗西捕於逸園、暨南由陳鎭祥坐鎭中堅、實力鞏固不少、上半時暨南先開紀錄、繼成各一、下半時暨南又以三比一勝、而西捕所獲兩球、全係暨南請客、戈倒而中、實際上西捕並無建樹也、此外有兩塲乙組重要賽、震旦三比三和法陸軍、的翰一比二敗於英海軍、</p>
<p>今日秩序、東華隊戰臘寬斯於逸園、下午三時開始、此爲西捕甲組重要比賽之一、亦東華本季在聯賽中最吃緊之一塲、臘克斯之靈魂鮑賽列、雖已離滬、但猶不失爲一勁敵、其攻守力量之平均、不下於法商、東華隊之實力、固已無容介紹、而今日之賽之主要點、須視東華兩翼之能否善爲利用、是賽東華原可有七成勝利希望、但臘克斯之快捷善戰、員未可過分樂觀也、此外尙有東華乙對沙谷爾、暨南乙對勞逸爾之預備組、及優游對猶太之乙組賽、暨六塲晨聯賽等、茲將今日東華臘克斯之陣綫及秩序錄下、</p>

<p>威利　悟蕾　培特　特飛　奧克萊</p>
<p>相持不下</p>
<p>開始接觸、西捕蓓蕾到遲、僅十人應戰、石永楠撥球進攻、雙方混戰多時、各無進展、蓓蕾忽忽趕到、加入戰團、先聲奪人、盤球進襲、强弩飛處、葉倍初撲地救出、奧克萊主踢角球、落地甚佳、葉奮勇揮出、險去未久、蓓蕾捲土重來、在右角十二碼猛射、葉培初身手靈敏、再度救險、暨南酣戰之下、王南珍獨出奇兵、沿邊進襲、球至中央、伍樹芬鐵頭迎去、球中曼英之身、陳明直趕上再射、球中門柱彈回、徒勞無功、</p>
<p>各立一功</p>
<p>未幾、陳明直躡足奮起、王南珍傳球中央、伍樹芬趕上猛射、守門看守不及、紀錄遂開、西捕雄心不死、極盡反攻、威利胡特崛起中原、在十二碼處射球、葉培初未及注意、隨意接住、距球已進球門綫內、無事生非、徒失一球、造成和局時、距上牛時終結僅二分鍾、</p>
<p>二次倒戈</p>
<p>休息再開、顏連進王南珍連絡得宜、深入腹地、伍樹芬福至心靈、拔脚攻門、敵人猝未及防、球中門內右角、成二對一之局勢、西捕旣遭變故、三軍用命、誓雪恥恨、惟轉轉疆塲、盤球前進、透納接應之下、舉足攻門、徐鴻蔭弄巧成掘、滿擬擋住、不料反演倒戈、又無謂犧牲一球、</p>
<p>連中兩球</p>
<p>西捕無中生有、銳氣大張、威利主開角球、恰到好處、奧克萊頭頂正着、幸葉培初化險爲夷、王南珍再次進兵、劉怡讚頭迎有功、惜未得采、劉不肯甘休、與伍樹芬一搭一擋、進攻敵方、伍樹芬球運特佳、於十五碼處射門、又告得手、最後陳明直邊綫進兵、傳球中央、石永楠趕上一脚、球應聲入網、成四對二、西捕雖竭力抵抗、終難如願、鳴余收兵、四比二暨南二次吿捷、</p>
<h3>中華足球中字組　光華四比一勝友聲　今日共十塲比賽</h3>
<p>中華足球會中字組昨有一塲比賽、爲光華對友聲、下午三時在大西路光華大學球塲舉行、光華雖曾敗於復旦、最近勤加練習、陣容顯見鞏固、友聲球藝、亦頗可觀、究以民衆集團、平素缺習較少、不若學校隊之團結、故結果四比歸一光華勝利、上半時光華凈勝兩隊、</p>
<h3>西聯乙組兩幕重要比賽　震旦約翰抗戰不利　震旦和法陸軍三比三　約翰敗於海軍一比二</h3>
<p>西聯足球乙組比賽、昨日國人球隊共有三組比賽、均甚重要、而表演亦多精彩、且與奪標前途、俱有極大關係、結果震旦三比三和法陸軍、的翰一比二敗於英海軍、另一組靑華對衛生之戰、結果未詳、</p>
<p>震旦</p>
<p>該隊球藝、頗爲强勁、出師以來、從未敗北、奪標希望、呼聲甚高、昨與法陸軍戰於虹口公園第二塲、雙方競爭、至爲劇烈、法軍頑强抗戰、聲勢殊盛，震旦亦小心僅愼、積極搏戰、彼此互有建樹、搆成三三和局、震旦未能連勝、失去寳貴之一分、殊爲可惜、</p>
<p>約翰</p>
<p>亦爲常勝軍、抱有奪取寳座之决心、昨遇英海軍於申園、以爲不難連捷、無如昨日出戰之英兵、爲一新來之艦隊、實力頗强、分庭抗禮、上半時各無所得、下半時開始、的翰學子一個疏忽、卽被丘八攻入一球、的翰極力反攻、氣焰殊盛、球常盤旋於英兵門前、卒於二十餘分鐘時、還敬一只、造成各一平手、此後互有驚險、均能保住江山、滿以爲將成和局、不料最後四分鐘時、忽被英軍打進判分勝負之一球以二比一收塲、</p>
<h3>聯絡太差　辛隊敗於信通　總結果四三比卅三　兩隊表演均無特色</h3>
<p>辛隊籃球隊昨晚與海賊改名之信通隊、作友誼賽於申園、雙方表演、均無特色、聯絡較差、行動亦慢、而辛隊人馬之時代、均已過去、欲求進步、非捐除陳腐之打法、作有規則之訓練不可、全局信通一路領前、上半時十九比十五、總結果四十三比三十二、</p>
<p>上半時</p>
<p>前廿分鐘之形勢、較爲平均、開始後、信通連獲五分、辛隊團結反攻、馮念華許文奎陳祥龍相繼得分、曾以十四比十三領先、形勢頗好、信通加緊防禦、卡遜拉姆余等幾次中的、皮塞爾不甘落伍、紀錄增至十九分、辛隊僅由文奎罰中一分、成十五與十九之比、辛隊反屈其下、</p>
<p>下半時</p>
<p>在無精打彩中、信通賴萊茵史規亞之左石調濟、分數扶搖直上、當三十四分時、辛隊僅十六分、爲孫寳慶所罰中、而後陳祥龍藍下托入、小馮罰得後、許文奎以遠射妙中、聲勢驟然一振、繼而文奎祥龍又加三分、大見起色、無奈信通再激再厲、萊茵卡遜等頻頻獲分、最後結果、辛隊卒以三十二比四十三敗北、二隊將於下星期三作二决比賽、</p>
<p>信通</p>
<p>辛隊</p>
<p>上半時信通十九辛隊十五</p>
<p>下半時信通二四辛隊十七</p>

<p>標紗近漲遠跌</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、近月因多方準備收貨、氣勢甚堅、繼續上升、但二盤以大阪三品紗步入高境、靑島紗廠工潮尙未解决、市價盤盤上漲、而天津帮購辦現紗獨健、因此市况愈挺、結果近月比上日收槃價均漲二元半、遠漲五角至一元一角、午後開盤、本　散戶被軋而堅、再見高峰、惟遠月獲利者了結回鬆、迨至三收盤、多說紗廠罷工解决之期當不遠矣且某廠有二十支金城雙鹿雙喜紗解進、因此市象軋挫、結果各月比上午收盤價跌六角至一元三·四角、查賣出合興七千五百五十包、賡豐七千三百包、長餘一千〇五十包、豐泰一千八百包、元一一千〇五十包、大昌成二千五百五十包、益昶三千四百五十包、潤康四千六百包、信誠四千包裕大一千五百包、興昌三千七百包、買進大孚一千二百五十包、恒益三千三百五十包、聚興二千三百五十包、明德六千一百五十包、大慶一千二百五十包、森康三千四百五十包、恒德一千四百五十包、仁豐四千八百包、長豐五千三百五十包、瑞大四千五百包、泰昌一千九百五十包、同和三千包、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<p>近月通記扒空</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因美棉漲跌互見、上下一至六磅音、印棉漲二羅比二五、市勢尙平靜、二盤以後、因通記空頭紛紛抵補、同時紗市良好、買風驟起、漲氣允急、各月在跳三四角、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲四角半至五角、午後開盤、市上多說紗廠工潮當可平息、於是買者活躍、形勢較緊、通記在近月紛紛扒空、遠月激動、各月均漲二角、迨至收盤、聞外棉情勢平凡、現棉交易殊滯、復入疲境、結果各月比上午收盤價跌五分至一角、查賣出大孚九千五百擔、福康四千五百擔、長和二千五百擔、生源一千九百擔、大豐一千四百擔、明德六千八百　、合興二千二百　、賡豐三千七百擔、瑞大三千四百擔、長餘六千七百擔、豐泰四千二百　、益昶二千三百擔、永大二千七百担、信誠一萬一千五白担、興昌三千扭、買進吉豐二千八百担、通記六千一百担、仁豐一萬五千担、泰昌二千九百祖、潤康一萬一千七百担、源興昌一萬零八百担、永大二千七百担、新昶四千一百担、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<h3>投機商集中於棉紗　本月期一週來高漲九元　總存七十七萬三千包</h3>
<p>來紗廠工潮劇烈、且影響青島紗廠亦罷工怠工、於是大阪三品紗飛漲一·二十元、本月由二百三十元直漲至二百四十八元、上海紗布交易所亦有擠軋空頭、而存紗趨减、買方大爲活躍、市價邁沙前進、本月紗頂高峯會達二百四十四元、自九一八以後之新紀錄、但本月份營業尙剩二日、至二十四日截止、週末中棉公司亦已掉期、金業帮大量出籠、收盤趁勢略形和緩、查本月期比前週價高漲九元、遠月僅漲八角、足見軋空之烈、查棉紗存賬數最近一星期中激增二十四萬七千五百包、（十月十四日）總存量爲五十二萬六千包、至昨日止總存量增至七十七萬三千五百五十包、棉花激增二十七萬八千三百擔、（十月十四日）總存量爲一百五十二萬八千二百祖、至昨日止增至一百六十萬〇穴千四百担、較棉紗爲减、可見投　商目標集中於棉紗、自下月起期限僅剩四個月期、多空籌碼日增期限縮短、　後之變遷範圍愈形擴大矣、前途之風波巨浪、殊難逆料也、</p>

<h3>期麥為洋麥帶起　賣方有大批出檔　故漲度尙不甚巨</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份平寂異常、以洋麥報價、雖續好一四角左右、惟市塲人心、因買賣多趨觀望、致各月份交易寂寞、開價甚少、本月份至一月份、均無出人、二三月份微好一二分、迨至下午開盤、各月份交易、突形暢旺、因現洋麥喊價、升提三角、致各月份市面、提漲三四五分不等、賣方亦有大批出檔、故漲度尙不甚巨、據業中人之推測、以爲各路禁運糧食、麥到必稀、彷彿易於樂觀耳、現麥市面、行客扳售、廠方想擯、全市無正式交易、聞申大應酬千餘包、高貨開六元一角次爲五分云、</p>
<h3>河米仍祇北方去路</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、共到有七十餘號、貨共萬千五千餘石、內中薄稻占三分之二、故薄稻市况、際客帮包胃稍懈、計去六千餘包、但吃盤見緊、致形勢帶軟、行價貶修五分、厚糊本街銷路殊呆、故包子雖各有一千五百餘包去路、而價續落數分至近角、杜洋尖相隨低落近尺、陰變元平疲之格、</p>

<h3>絲茶　洋莊絲似有滿足狀</h3>

<h3>油蔴　蔴油隨原料昂騰　　懷速新货漲至二十六元</h3>
<p>蔴油市况、照今庚原料之出產尙屬豐稔、然而地頭價高、以致　源難能暢旺、新貨市自開二十　元之後、到貨　　缺乏而　鐘尙可、故　市卽增開至二十五元、至本月上旬、甬江突有問津、本街零銷亦見活動、成交六七百　、價復提開二十五元五角、近數日來緣原料繼續騰　是以貨主心思、益見堅俏、售價緊板之下、市至昨日立提漲至二十六元　遠一路，貨、成交五百　、由該爾帮辦去、照目下供源、依　缺乏、趨勢當居穩固、陳油市面自內地帮動後、货品雖然色昧兩退、而該帮去路仍未稍减、市自二十二元開後、貨戶旣以銷途活潑、喊價因之益見挺俏、市價隨之逐漸增高、上月花邊、有金蘭帮動辦、本月則杭帮續取不息、前後交易不下二三千聽、竟被搜羅一空、市面漲至二十三元六角、刻下據云該陳貨已無存貨應市云、</p>
<h3>五金二半英鋼板見最高價　開至十二元五角　爲近十年所未有</h3>

<h3>「沒有空防便沒有國防」</h3>
<p>— 楊公懷</p>
<p>小朋友，你們知道嗎？現代的戰爭是立體型的戰爭，因爲戰爭的區域不再限於平地或海面，而已發展到空中去了。在未來的戰爭中，最能發揮其戰鬥威力的，便是空軍。他可不待海陸軍的動員出戰，輕巧地飛到敵陣去，破壞他們的防禦工程，搗亂他們的後方，使敵人陷於攻戰皆不可能的境地。一個國家，能够充實空軍的戰鬥力，當然是作戰的上策；就是要鞏固國防，抗禦外侮，也非在空防上努力不可！</p>
<p>防空的重要，諒小朋友都已明瞭，那末，我們將怎樣去實行防空呢？</p>
<p>從消極方面說：像施行燈火管制，組織消防隊，充實防毒的設備等，都是很重要的。但從積極方面說：要防空而沒有實力的軍用飛機來和敵機作戰，那麼决沒有一個巨大的安全防空罩把全國的工商業中心和國防要塞一起籠罩起來的。所以要積極的防空，非充實空軍的實力部隊不可，這是極明白的事。我國現在正處於存亡的交又點，淞滬之戰，長城之役，我國因防空實力的薄弱飽受敵人空軍的威脅和蹂躪，這敎訓我們是永世忘不了的。以後當動員全國的人力，財力，去充實防空，以應付未來的危機。小朋友們！請各人反省一下：你對於空防方面，不論直接，間接，盡過你的責任沒有？</p>
<p>我記得外國一位軍事專家曾說：「沒有空防便沒有國防」，這句話的確具有眞實性，希望各位小朋友牢記着！</p>
<h3>兒童掌故隨談</h3>
<p>— 易生</p>
<p>道韞詠絮</p>
<p>謝安官至太傅，一門風雅，常聚集了一家大小講論詩文，以至那家庭中充塞着咿唔諷誦的聲息。冬季裏有一天，正値雪下紛紛，謝翁又喚到兒女們圍爐賞雪，相共研談文義。沒一會兒，那雪下得更大更急了。謝翁很高興地出口成吟道：「白雪紛紛何所似？」一個姪子小名呌胡兒的順口接吟道：「撒鹽空中差可擬」。一個女孩子的聲氣在旁搶口道；「未若柳絮因風起」！大家注目一瞧，原來是謝安的姪女道韞忍不住要發表伊的意見，續吟出這一句來。於是謝翁大爲讚許笑樂。至今凡稱美女子們的文才，常引着謝道韞詠絮的故事爲比。</p>
<p>詩禮傳家，書香門第的孩子們，平日問有家庭敎育陶鎔着，當然他們的文學修養超勝於平常人家的孩子們一等了。不過一個人的悟性的敏鈍，與胸襟的雅俗總關天賦，是難以勉强的。叔叔出了題目，哥哥取空中撒鹽來譬喩雪飛，也可算得近似了；妹妹改取風吹柳絮，非但其事理自然，——不如空中撒鹽之出於牽强杜撰，——更見其情形相像。此句一出，恐怕從此再沒有其他可與爭勝者了！這麼風雅的詩句出在一個小女子口裏，所以是更覺其可矜責了！</p>
<h3>敵愾之歌</h3>
<p>— 路爾鈺</p>
<p>你不要灰心，</p>
<p>也不要害怕，</p>
<p>你不要回頭，</p>
<p>那怕荆棘牽住你的藍衫。</p>
<p>你要走路！</p>
<p>你要前進！</p>
<p>你的路走不完，</p>
<p>你的責任負不盡</p>
<p>幾千隻眼睛瞧着你，</p>
<p>幾千隻手指着你</p>
<p>他們看你成功，失敗，</p>
<p>你自己先得壯一壯膽！</p>
<p>孩子們！</p>
<p>笨不過沙漠　中的駱駝，</p>
<p>然而他不辭這一生的艱苦！</p>
<h3>一個提議</h3>
<p>— 南洋小學六年級生莊俊傑</p>
<p>小朋友們！現在的國勢已到生死存亡的最後關頭了！你看，敵入强搶了我們東北四省不算數，還想併吞全中國。要是大家天天看報的話，那麼華北的形勢危險到如何程度，也不容我來細說了。最近敵人又嗾使一般僞匪和漢奸，侵擾我們的綏遠了：並且用了它們的飛機和大砲，拚命向綏遠進攻。可是守綏遠的一般將士，都十分勇敢地抵抗他們；不畏飢寒，不怕犧牲，死也要盡守士之職；他們的精神多麼可欽佩啊！</p>
<p>但是，綏遠不是綏遠將士的綏遠，也不是綏遠人的綏遠，而是我們全中國人的綏遠。故大家都有捍衛疆士的責任。我們小朋友愛國不敢後人，也應該拿出一些力量來盡點責任。所以我有一個提議：就是把各位最近幾日內要買糖菓玩具的錢節省下來，集合後送到申報館裏請他們轉給前綫一般抗敵的勇士們，買衣穿，買米吃，一方面大家努力向各方募捐些衣服錢物，匯給勇士們當作鼓勵。我想「聚沙成塔。集腋成裘」，至少和許多正在抗敵作戰的鬥士們有一點帮助吧！希望小朋友共同起來襄此盛舉！</p>
<h3>高山之上為什麼會冷</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>敏兒放學歸來了，爸爸照例要問他今天學著些什麼東西，敏兒答道：「今天上常識課時，陸先生吿訴我們離日愈近則愈熱；所以天上如果沒有太陽，人類及一切生物都要凍死了。」</p>
<p>爸爸笑道：「那未高山之上，不是離日愈近，爲什麼山頂有終年積雪不消的？還有，在夏季裏，爲什麼有錢的人們都偏要進暑在高山之上呢？」</p>
<p>敏兒想了一想，答道：「這個，我不知；不過先生的話，是不會錯的。」</p>
<p>爸爸道：「不知就是不知，你說得很是；可是你說先生的話，總是不會錯的，則求知不應如是馬虎。人家說的話，無論錯與不錯，我們應當仔細研究才是。啊。」</p>
<p>敏兒道：一那末，難道陸先生的話講錯了嗎？」</p>
<p>爸爸道：「不，他的話很對。不過求知總要多想。倘使爹爹是你，我就要把剛纔提出的兩個問題，請敎陸先生了。」</p>
<p>敏兒聽了，懊悔不已；爸爸因安慰他，並說道：「高山頂上，何以終年積雪不消？這個道理，想陸先生不及講，待我講給你聽吧。」</p>
<p>「山頂固然離日愈近。但我們要知道，保持體溫，必須穿衣；那末，同樣要保持太陽的溫度，使不外散，也必須有一樣緊要的東西包裹着，這是無可疑的；而這樣東西呢，偏離地越高越缺少。你想，這是什麼東西呀」？</p>
<p>敏兒道：「這樣東西，旣不能見，莫非是空氣嗎？」</p>
<p>爸爸笑道：「不錯。這空氣好像一條毯兒，把大地包裏　，保存溫度；並且不僅一條毯兒，有無數毯兒重重包裹着，方能阻止日光逃往別處去。所以，我們不但需要日光，給我們以熱，同時，有了熱，還要仗着這東重「毯兒」來包着它，我們才不會感冷。離地越高，則空氣越薄。空氣越薄，則日光越易四散。日光越易四散，所以高山之上，積雪有終年不消的，雖然山頂離日越近。懂得這理，那末在厦季裏，有錢的人們何以紛紛要到山上避暑去，也不必多說了」</p>
<p>敏兒聽了，恍然大悟。</p>
<h3>從吃糖炒栗子說起</h3>
<p>— 德隣</p>
<p>昨天在日斜傍晚的時候，我工作完畢了從行中回家，走過一爿水菓店的門口，在人行道傍；正在炒着糖炒栗子，並且用玻璃鏡架寫了「天津良鄕」四個字，我便買了幾包，拿在手裏暖洪烘地還炙手可熱；到家以後，我七歲的一個表弟，放了學正在我家裏逛，我便解了兩包，和他一起剝壳吃着，兩人把一個個的栗子，且剝且吃，於是使我想起了帝國主義的日本，對於兒童平素的生活，無論在家庭，或學校裏，他一切的接觸，常常給他一種良好的陶冶。</p>
<p>譬如一個小學的敎師，當他對小學生談起了糖炒栗子是最好吃的東西的時候，那麼就要吿訴他們糖炒栗干是產在天津良鄉的，如其我們能够把支那的華北奪了來，那麼可以儘量地吃了，又如講到了橋子；那敎師又要說：支那福建的橘子，是最甜美不過的，比美國產的還要好，如其我們把福建打了下來，那麼橘子便可以吃不盡了，說到了桃子；一定也要說：支那奉化出產的是如何的甜美，如其我們打到了支那的奉化去，便可以享受無盡了。從道點上，我們便可以知道日本帝國主義對於兒童敎育的重視。在兒童的一舉一動的接觸之間，和平素生活過程中，隨時隨地都在鼓動他們愛國的情緒，侵略的與趣，同時也對他們激起對國家的實任，這是我們所値得注意的。</p>
<p>因爲吃糖炒栗子，使我想起了日本帝國主義對於兒童平素生活過程中的陶冶，但是在我們中國的兒童，也該給他們一種愛國思想的啟示；便是像吃到了糖炒栗子，也可以吿訴他們糖炒栗子產地的天津良鄉，現在快被敵人奪去了，我們應該去設法牧回來才是。這樣至少可以激起他們脆弱的小小心靈，明白到國難如何的嚴重，帝國主義如何的侵略，使他們將來長大了踏釗社會上，方始能够負起爲國家效勞和收回失地的責任了。</p>
<h3>物理小常識</h3>
<p>— 嚴懋德</p>
<p>洗毛筆時爲何毛在水中四面張開，出水後為何卽聚為一束</p>
<p>當洗毛筆昨，忽然毛筆的毛四面張開，出水後卽聚爲一束，小朋友！在洗筆時，定有如此的疑問？原來毛筆在水中時，各分子與毛筆有附着力的關係，因此就向四面張開；當脫離水向外面時，因爲水有表面張力，能使毛筆聚爲一束。</p>
<p>捧入水中何以看去是彎曲的？</p>
<p>捧入水中看去好似彎曲，這是由於光的屈折關係，因爲原來的光要在二種不同密度的物體，纔能起屈折，當光由空氣中進入水中時，比原來的進路遠於水面。反之，由水中出空氣時，比原來的進路近於水面，所以看上去好似屈折。</p>
<p>小朋友！當你拿一棒，挿着有水的地方，就可瞪明我的話是不錯的</p>

<h3>菊花</h3>
<p>— 上海知本小學五年級生吳品賢</p>
<p>我們學校裏，有一個小花園，園內的東西，有一帶籬笆，籬笆旁邊，有幾十棵菊花·長着碧靑而零亂的葉子，看去好似一堆亂靑草，園裏除了菊花，還有許多名花。從春天起到秋天止，一時一時不斷的開着。同學們在課後，都去鑑賞名花，誰也不向菊花望一望。</p>
<p>秋深了，菊花要發展它的生路了。雖有寒冷的西北風吹着，濃霜罩着，那菊花不爲風霜所迫，竟能振作精神，和那殘暴的風霜奮鬥，結果，風霜失了暴力，菊花竟傲然開起來了。</p>
<p>這時，圍裏的長春，薔薇，玫瑰等，有的謝花落葉了，有的枝幹赤條條約立着。只有那籬笆旁邊的菊花，開着紅的，白的，黃的，紫的，五顏六色，美麗無比，同學們都來欣賞菊花了。</p>
<p>我想：菊花有今日的結果，是從嚴寒中奮鬥得來的。再看我們中國，被帝國主義不斷的侵略，我們四萬萬同胞，要保護國家，安全民族的生存計。自當振作精神，同心合力，槍口一致對外，我國要稱雄於世界，捨去抵抗，奮鬥，別無他法了。</p>

<h3>會說話的油燈</h3>
<p>—答廣州王自強</p>
<p>自强弟：</p>
<p>你的信我們收到了。你　述在石牌露營的情形，很詳盡而且也很五趣。你對我們這信箱的計多建議，我們很願接受。在可能範團內，我們願盡力謀改進。</p>
<p>你提出的問題，確是値得注意的。在晚上練習燈語，自然得用電筒。不過也有它的弊處，第一是不經濟，第二是電池用完了就沒有辦法。我們經過詳細的討論，覺得有好些補救的方法，這裏預備吿訴你一個較切實的辦法。</p>
<p>你們出外露營不是帶着營　嗎？還有你們的自由車隊裏不是有車燈嗎？這就是一個很好的通語燈呀。火油是在什麼地方都可以買到的，不像電池那樣要在較繁盛的地方才買得到，而且火油的價錢比起電池來也着實便宜得多呀！因此我們以爲在練習燈語時很可以用油燈來替代。</p>
<p>你可以拿幾塊木版，釘成一個有蓋的木箱，在木箱前面挖一個圓洞，然後在洞的上端釘上一塊活動的木板，再鏤上一根把手。再把點亮了的油燈放在箱裏，火光對着洞口，把箱蓋蓋好，這樣就完成了。你祇消用手將把手上下撥動，那塊箱前的木板自會跟着上下移動。那麼木板掀起的時間長，燈光射出的時間也長，木板蓋着洞口時，燈光也不見了。這樣你就可以利用露光的久暫和决數來表示電報的各種記號，對方便會很明晰地收着你發出去的信息了。</p>
<p>你想我們這辦法可以用用嗎？請了，祝你進步！</p>

<h3>全國童軍檢閱完畢後東北童軍的哀鳴</h3>
<p>— 鴻富抄</p>
<p>全國童子軍第二次的大檢閱，已經在十月十一日那天閉幕了！各單位的童子軍當然都是很快活的回到家裏去了！但是我們可敬可愛的遼寗吉林黑龍江熱河四省的童子軍，他們却是很感觸。在各地的童軍未離營地之前，他們曾經在營地的播昔台裏，作過一篇極沉痛的話別，裏面報吿東北小朋友的現狀。現在我把這篇有價値的話別，介紹給小朋友們！</p>
<p>各位小朋友：你們看到東北四省童子軍，也來參加這次全國大檢閱露營，各位都感到極大的興奮，流露出無限的快慰。我們初到營地時，就各位所給我們的種種暗示，就斷定各位的心悄是這樣的。今天在檢閱塲裏，各位給我們以非常的歡迎，更證實我們的預測是不錯的，對各位的同情與歡迎，我們無可酬答，　是流了幾　眼淚，多增幾分敵愾同仇心，對復興民族，收復失地的工作，多增幾分自信。在收復失地時，各位會給我們同樣的同情和援助。這决大檢閱大露營，依舊保存東北四省的單位，這消息我們得到很晚，因時間的侷促，籌備的困難，所以參加的人動很少，看起來很冷落，給諸位添了許多傷感，這是我們非常抱歉的，可是他這决檢閱完畢後，我們要繼續的努力，更加奮勉，用以答謝各位歡迎的盛意。</p>
<p>我們帶來一些日前住在東北的小朋友們的消息，想報吿給各位，各位一定是很願意聽的，他們的生活狀况怎樣呢！？每一個學校裏的主任都是某國人，某國人當敎員的，更是多得多，有的學校連校長也是是國人了！　們在那種環境下，非但不能讀一民主義，不能讀中國歷史，不能讀中國地理，連有關尙武精神紀載的書籍，也都成禁書了！他們當然沒有機會來受童了軍訓練，來參加大檢閱大露營，他們都作些什麼事呢？舉一個例子，就拿開會來說給你聽吧！第一件事是參御影，就是向僞皇帝溥逆行最敬禮，第二件是讀詔書，就是溥逆僞皇帝所頒的詔書，第三件是唱僞國國歌，第四件是遙拜皋城，就是向僞皇帝溥逆所住的地方參拜禮。各位想想，他們願意作這些事嗎？他們常然不願意，然而在那種環境下，又不得不那樣作，他們精神上够多麼痛苦，無論生命或財產，都是毫　保障，其他方面的痛苦，更是一言難盡，各位聽到這段消息，一定是更典奮，更同情；或者卽刻就想拯救水深火熱中的東北小朋友。現在合各位約定，遵照大會長訓示，給我們的各項守則，加緊訓練，努力修養，在會長指導下，完成我們的使命，對復興民族的工作，我們願追　各位之後，共同努力，對收復東北失地的工作，我們願站在最前綫上，來和强暴的勢五决鬬，最後謝謝各位，並祝各位健康，前　無量</p>
<h3>孝（五）</h3>
<p>— 海</p>
<p>柏絲可菲又因爲帶着的那張護照上，寫明着是一位陸軍大佐的女兒，所以一路上很受那些下級官員的注意。俘得到人家優待的地方，簡直是不可勝數，至於被人拒絕或薄待的事，那是比較的很少的。後來伊會向人說：『人家總以爲我遠迢迢地趕這漫長的路程，是非常危險的，就因爲他們只聽了我訴說種種冒險的經過，而對於受人優待的事情，並沒留意的緣故』。</p>
<p>有一决伊曾吃了一個很大的驚嚇。伊在一個村子裏，投上了好多家的門，要求一宿，不知怎樣都被他們拒絕了。但是有一個老頭兒在一口回絕之後，忽又跑上來喚伊回去。伊很不歡喜他那張面龐，但也沒法可想，不得不轉身跟他同去。他的妻子也像他一樣的面目可憎，等他們一進了那小屋子，就把那門上粗粗的鐵鍵拴上了。牆壁上的一個窟窿裏，燒着幾根橡木片。柏絲可菲從這微弱的火光中，瞧見老夫婦倆的神惰很爲難看，當下他們就問伊是從那裏來的。</p>
<p>柏絲可菲答道：『從依吉村來。我是往彼得堡去的』。他們倆又問道：『你此去可是帶着很多的錢麼』？『如今只剩下八十個銅古貝了』。柏絲可菲回答着。伊心中暗暗自幸，身上只剩這一些錢了。</p>
<p>那老婦人嚷着道：『這是謊話！人們要楚不帶着錢，那决不能趕道遠遠的路的』。</p>
<p>伊雖是極力申晚自已確實只有道一些錢，但他們倆還是不信。直使伊又驚又怒，止不住流下眼淚來。末後他們給了伊幾個山芋吃，喚伊在一座大磚爐上躺下，因爲爐面上很闊很平。凡是俄羅斯貧民往往把它當做牀鋪用的。伊將上衣脫下來放在一邊，連同伊的錢袋和行李袋放在一起，心想那錢袋中只有這一些些錢，决不會做出謀財害命的事情來的。當下伊很虔誠的禱吿了一番，然後躺了下來。一會兒他們倆以爲伊已睡熟了，就開始竊竊私語起來。</p>
<p>『伊一定還有較多的錢，那鈔票是不會沒有的』。</p>
<p>那老婦人忙道：『我瞧見伊　子裏有一條鏈子，掛着一個小小的袋兒，伊的錢一定是藏在這裏的』。</p>
<p>『　着他們倆更放低了聲音說道：『外面沒有人瞧見伊到我們屋子裏來的，誰也不知道伊還留在這村子裏』。</p>
<p>不多一會，柏絲可菲很吃驚的眼見那老婦人竟爬上爐子來了。伊忙又說明自己實在沒有錢，並且求伊饒命，但那老婦人並不回答，只把伊　子裏的袋兒拉將下來，又把伊的衣服周身撫摸，並且脫去伊的靴子，扳開伊的手來，而那老頭兒拿着燈在一旁照着；可是他們搜查了一回，見那袋中只有一張護照，並沒有別的東西，於是拋下了伊，自去睡了。</p>

<p>上海市民對於維持國家民族生存的自衛抗戰是素具擁護與援助的熱忱的，這從東北義勇軍的抗戰等經過中，已有充分的表現。到了最近，外侮雖壓迫愈急，而各界人士的愛國情緒亦愈益高昻。綏遠是我們的國防第一錢，不，是我們最後的國防綫，是東北四省失陷冀察問題發生後我國中原的最後屏障。這關係國運最後存亡的綏遠防禦戰事，終於由醞釀多日中揭開大戰的序幕了。儘管友邦聲明着那是中國的正規軍隊與當地匪軍的衝突，儘管漢奸們掩飾着那是賊匪跳梁不足深慮；但明眼的人們莫不暸解匪僞侵綏的背景及其用意，亦莫不警惕於綏遠防禦得失的重要，何况傅作義將軍和其部下英勇抗戰的精神與矢忠衛國的熱忱，不下於過去抗敵諸將士，無怪戰幕一開，華北及各地的「援綏運動」就風起雲湧，盛極一時了。上海各團體的提倡組織綏軍後援會，自然是迫切的需要着。節食節用以充物質援助，已有人倡議而且開始實行了，至於捐助寒衣的節衣運動，却至今尙未有人注意到。我們從赴前方慰勞將士者的報吿中，已經曉得在初冬苦寒中防衛邊塞的士兵，最需要的是寒衣，但是我認爲以所捐金錢購衣，不及直接捐送舊衣較爲經濟便利，而捐送舊衣中又以捐送絨綫衣最爲適宜。我的理由如下：</p>
<p>（一）捐助奮衣的犧牲比捐助金錢爲小，尤其在民衆的心理上，覺得這是惠而不費的事，因此成績必更爲踴躍可觀。</p>
<p>（二）先將金錢匯至綏遠，再要匯至都市或內地購辦軍衣，則匯費與時間已先受兩重損失。</p>
<p>（三）購辦新棉衣費用較大，　此紗花高漲各地缺貨的市塲中，是否能有充分的供給，還有問題，卽使有，則大半操於外商手中之價格將更形高昂，不如捐助節餘舊衣爲合於經濟原理。</p>
<p>（四）捐衣與軍隊不比捐與難民，可不管式樣長短，祗取禦寒，而軍隊衣着應整齊輕便，以壯軍威而利作戰，故棉袍長衣均不適宜，惟絨綫衣或絨內衣可穿在軍衣內，較爲合用</p>
<p>（五）絨綫工業我國目前甚發達，產品價廉質美，當市民補製新衣之時，可收促進工商之效，再則婦女從事生產者少，難得有節餘金錢可資捐助，故檢送奮絨衣與趕製新絨衣，將爲婦女救國的實際工作之一。</p>
<p>至於捐募的辦法，當然應由各界所組的「綏軍後援會」來發起籌劃，以收劃一與普遍的效果，現在就作者所想到的幾點來貢獻一點意見如下：</p>
<p>（一）理想的辦法是以家庭爲單位，每家最少捐助一件。絨綫衣不比金錢的易於匯寄或親送，故應於公佈日期後，由後援會派員用卡車挨戶收取。</p>
<p>（二）在收取前，應有十日左右之報紙宣傳及播音宣傳，使市民有充分之凖備：其已有二件以上者，應將較舊者預爲檢存，其僅有一件者，應卽購織新衣，以便替代。</p>
<p>（三）收衣人員應預携正式收據，每件隨時掣給一聯，只須填一姓名門牌，另備「上海援綏絨衣」印戳各人一枚，當面在衣上蓋戳，以証明該衣不致被盜賣或遺失。</p>
<p>（四）倘第一次挨戶勸募時，或有雖願捐助而因趕製不及，或事前未見宣傳者，應由收衣人員記明門牌，於一星期後彙齊願捐未捐之地名，再收取一次。</p>
<p>（五）勸募以絨衣爲主，其他短衣如適合軍用亦可照收，但收據上應註明「他類」二字，以資分別而便統計。</p>
<p>（六）爲昭信實起見，或者需要公佈結果，辦法是：每里弄貼布一張，祇塡明「該里一號幾件，二號幾件，……總數幾件」等，而報紙公布總結果則僅以里弄爲單位，卽某路某里幾件，不必公佈台銜，以節省廣吿篇幅，而市民查考對照，已極便利，如有不符，隨時可質問更正。</p>
<p>上述辦法，係就捐衣的特殊性質上想到的幾點，至於詳細辦法，則希望各界研究討論。其中有很顯明的特點，就是捐衣收據，每件一張，不像金錢收據，核算稽查較難，故可减少或有之作弊，而增厚市民之信仰，又如舊衣祇供穿着，不比金錢之可作別用，而衣上加戳更可免偸換盜失諸弊。過去上海一部分市民無端懷疑援馬捐欵之用途，曾使一般熱心代收捐欵的團體機關平白地受了許多寃屈，可知此種方法實應妥加運用，以增效果。</p>
<p>以上的意見如荷各界贊助而付諸實行的話，則以上海三百餘萬的人口計算，平均每家五口合捐絨綫衣一件，應有六十萬件之多。上海原是不論貧富均重衣着的地方，卽使除去貧窮到不能置備絨綫衣者之外，至少十萬件是不成問題的。這十萬件絨綫衣，立刻可以溫煖苦守邊疆的十萬大兵的心胸，同時又可省下幾十萬應置棉衣的金錢，移充軍械糧秣的供給，這無論在國防實力之充實上或作爲精神之鼓勵上，其所得的效果眞將不可以道里計呢。作者十二分的希望全上海各界市民，尤其是婦女界，一致起來贊助提倡，俾在國防後援上添一枝偉大的生力軍！（稿酬移充本報所主辦之「綏遠前方軍士慰勞金」）</p>

<h3>援綏與援助西班牙婦孺</h3>
<p>— 集從</p>
<p>西班牙的入民大衆，爲了自由與和平，已與勾結國外侵略勢力的叛軍血戰了幾個月的時間。在這中間，叛軍領袖因爲甘願作希特勒和莫梭里尼的奴才，甘願將本國土地和權利暗地裏獻給侵略國家，從德意兩國得來了大批毒瓦斯·飛機·大砲和各種最新的殺人利器，以殘殺保護共和愛好和平的國內人民乃至一般婦孺。對於這種情形，全世界凡是有正義感的人都非常憤慨；他們從各方面給與了西班牙合法政府和人民大衆以積極的援助，有的甚至跑到瑪德里，參加到最前錢上去與叛軍肉搏，使侵略者膽寒！我國因爲離西班牙較遠，過去對於該國人民的抗敵雖沒有積極援助的表現，但最近也有宋慶齡女士等發起援助西班牙婦孺，宣言號召全國婦女及同胞ｇ　致援助西班牙政府和人民，並盼我國婦女效法西國婦女爲國犧牲之精神，一致起來爭取民族的獨立。這種情形，在目前表現出來，不僅未絲毫失掉時效，而且還有更重大的意義。</p>
<p>我們是被侵略受壓迫的弱小民族，凡是世界上被侵略受壓迫的人類以及表同情於被壓迫者的勢力，都是我們的友軍；反之，凡是侵略者和壓迫者都是我們的敵人。因此，世界上任何一個地方的被壓迫被侵略的人羣遭到進攻，我們都當努力援助，正如我們遇到侵略時全世界的被侵略者要援助我們一樣：而且，也只有我們和全世界的友軍一致團結起來互相援助，大家才能獲得解放。西班牙的合法政府和其愛好自由和平的入民大衆遭到了侵略勢力的殘酷進攻，我們如不積極予以援助，那侵略者得到勝利，全世界的侵略勢力必要大大的膨脹，而使我們的解放遇到更大的困難。現在，西班牙殘酷的戰爭正在緊急關頭，同時，我們的直接敵人也正在用武力奪取我們的綏遠和華北，在客觀上我們的命運已和西國人民的命運相同，而大家在當前的反抗侵略，爭取獨立與自由的緊急任務也就一樣了；因此，目前我們的援助西班牙，實在也就是援助我們自己。</p>
<p>現在，對於綏遠將士英勇的抗敵，我全國人民已在積極擁護和援助了；同時，對於西班牙人民的與侵略勢力血戰，也有了熱烈的同情的表示了：這都充分瞪明了我國人民的眼目還淸明，熱血還在沸騰中，還能認淸當前的仇敵，還有積極抗敵的最大决心。不過，到目前爲止，我們對於綏遠抗敵將士的援助，還僅祗是金錢的捐助和精神的鼓勵，並未决心實行到前錢上去與那裏的戰士一致抗敵；而現刻在前錢上的兵力又極其有限，全國武力也尙未準備總的動員來對付敵人的新進攻；這當然是非常不够的。我們知道，進攻綏遠的匪軍並非普通的匪徒，而是侵略者收買來的先鋒隊。他們有大砲飛機與各種新式的武器，軍隊和軍需品都在不斷增加，且有侵略者的武力混入其中；我綏遠將士雖然英勇，但如不積極以武力援助，又怎能長期抵禦那樣的侵略勢力呢？說來眞是可憐，我們在報上只看到敵人的飛機轟炸我方陣地，却未見到自己有一架飛機去淮攻敵人，我們那樣多的飛機究到那兒去了呢！同時過去抗敵的戰略也還有問題，那就是只圖保守，不去進攻；這種抗戰實無異助敵人保全其陣地，預先决定將最後勝利獻與敵人。今後我們便應全反這種辦法，而要以全國的總動員，以周密完善的準備，以最大的决心和魄力與勇氣，由商都節節進攻，直到完全收復失地爲止。這樣，才可消滅侵略者的野心，才可獲得中華民族的徹底解放，東亞的眞正和平。</p>
<p>被壓迫的中華民族的解放，一部分的侵略者的失勢，必將使整個世界的侵略勢力受到最大的打擊，而正被侵略勢力蹂躪的西班牙及世界人民大衆也就易於獲得解放了。因此，我們全體動員的武力抗敵也就是在援助西班牙，援助世界的被侵略被壓迫者，目前援助綏遠和西班牙都是我們的重大任務。</p>

<h3>世界最高大厦</h3>
<p>— 俊生</p>
<p>紐約通訊</p>
<p>假使你乘船到紐約，當船快要到達這大都巿時，抬頭一望，便可使你看到一所在世界任何地方都見不到的高大的建築。它屹立在紐的市一的切大小建築物中，眞好像聖誕節日的蠟燭立在許多水菓之閒一樣，顯示得非常特別。如果要走到牠的下面去仰望，那就是望掉帽子，睜破眼睛，折斷頸項，也難於看淸它的頂層的。這個建築物便是紐的最高的建築愛姍派大厦。</p>
<p>巴黎的伊耳夫塔是世界最高的塔，其高度將近一千英尺，這當然也就很可驚了。但愛姆派大厦却比道塔還要高三百英尺！從街面起到頂層止，它共有一千二百四十八英尺那麼高；假使你高興用中國尺來計算，那就更會得出驚人的數字來了。它實際上共有八十六層，但是，在這上面還有從八十七層到百〇二層的的有二百英尺的高塔，道裏繁着空中巨物齊柏林飛船。</p>
<p>美國最速的風力是每小時百八十六英里，像愛姆派大厦那麼高的建築物，假使設計不好，一定是極危險的。對於這點，建築它的建築公司的顧問技師巴爾干氏也特別注意到了；他依據獨特的設計，採用安全的方法，使那麼大的風力對這樣高的大厦無可奈何。這裏値得提說的，是大厦的塔頂上設有戈諦克式的鋼鐵牌坊，在那上面有繫飛船的設備。一到晚間，便可看到明星似的赤色燈光在那繫飛船的塔頂上閃耀，那就是夜間飛行的標識。同時，擊飛船的地方還有四條支柱，都是鋼鐵做的；它們都貫通這大厦，深入地下三十三英尺，立在岩石的基礎上。所以，就是繫留着的飛船爲風吹動，對於建築全體也沒有多大影響的。</p>
<p>這樣高大的建築要消費多少材料呢？我們當然無從估計。不過，就承包建修的建築公司的負責人說，單是鐵就有五萬八千噸；就中只是四根中心柱也有一千萬磅，卽五千噸。道種情形，恐怕你還沒有聽見說過吧。</p>
<p>愛姆派大厦共有六十二座特別快電梯，它們都依據信號自動昇降停留。它們的速力大致是每分鐘一千二百英尺，所以從一層急行到頂上百〇二層，也只需一分多點兒時間。據說這裏的電梯速力還可超過這個以上，但因紐的的法律，限定電梯每分鐘行千二百英尺爲最高速力，所以這裏的電梯只能開到如此的速度。</p>
<p>在八十六層上有展望臺。想要登這展望臺，在八十層便當換乘別的電梯；要想到頂上繫飛船的地方，更須從此改換乘機。在那裏有一間可以收容五十人的屋子，這便是紐的最高的房屋，不，也許是世界最高的房屋吧。</p>
<p>本年春天，紐的市的電梯從業員曾發生大罷工，許多住在高樓大厦的人都感到了極大的因難；特別是那些穿着兩三寸高的高跟皮鞋的貴婦人，她們從來就少於走路，更沒有爬過高坡，所以在靈活的電梯忽然變成了死物的時候，她們要在幾百英尺乃至千把英尺高的屋子內自動上下，眞是等於受着極殘酷的苦刑！那種情形才使我們相信了辛克萊在「太平世界」中所描寫的並非完全的幻想。（註）就在這時，那一千二百多英尺高的紐的最高大厦內的六十二座電梯也不動了，平時住在這最高的房屋中睥睨紐的，展望美利堅，虎視全球的紳十闊人，現在也只有束手在道大厦的下層，仰望那高入雲霄的屋頂，徒喚奈何了　然而，世間却有些閒而好奇的人，他們乘着這個機會，特別帶着秒時計去登這一千多英尺高的大厦。據說在初登的時候，倒頗好玩，但上到六十八層時，便沒有精力冉往上行了：看看自己的錶，從開始上登起，已經過了三點半以上的時間。同時還說在最初的時候，平均每分鐘要上一層，但後來就漸决疲乏起來，待到行至九十層時，更覺得足痛腰酸，極想休息了；結果是只上到六十八層而頹喪地退了下來。</p>
<p>據統計，愛姆派大厦所需的電力，爲三千五百且羅瓦特，相當於的有人口四十萬的大都市的需要。如果將它所用的鐵聚合起來，則可鑄成紐的與門德爾間的長的五百英里的複綫軌道。同時，它所用的電綫和電話綫計有二百萬英尺之長，可以圍地球二轉。至於裏面的一切佈置和住在道中間的主人的消費，那更是難於統計。然而，在紐的的街頭，在美利堅的國內，却流浪着許多失業的人羣，他們的家裏不僅沒有電梯電話，沒有美麗的家具，就是麵包和日常的必需品也沒有啊！</p>
<p>至於這大厦的主人，則是美國有名的政治家亞爾·斯米斯。他曾做·紐的州長，兩决民主黨的大總統候選人。但在一九二八年美國大總統選舉中，他被共和黨所敗，從此便脫離政界，投入了實業界，與美國財閥丟彭德相提携，以千三百五十萬美金收買了被稱爲紐的境界標的弗多夫·澳大利亞大旅館，於是便努力計劃建設了這世界第一大厦。</p>
<p>每天午前八時到夜半，這最高的大厦是公開的；同時在頂上還備有記名簿，以備世界各國的達官，貴人，財閥留下大名，而大厦的主人亞爾。斯米斯也很高興接待道些貴賓顯客。至於貧賤的人們，那當然是與這大厦沒有緣分的。</p>
<p>（註）辛克萊所著的小說「太平世界」，曾在想像中描寫了工人罷工時貴婦人們在幾十層高的大厦內行走的艱難，令人發噓呌絕。這作品在數年前曾有「昭昭社」的中譯本，現在似乎買不到了。</p>

<h3>中國歷史上人口之研究</h3>
<p>— 好古</p>
<p>人們一提及中國的人口，便號稱四萬萬，但實際上究有多少呢？放下歷史上的人口不論，單說現在，所謂四萬萬，這還是淸道光二十二年所估計的，也不過是當時留華西人的一個概算，决不能說是正確的統計。慢說那時，就是現在也還是一樣，中國的政府機關和社會學者，對這問題也說不出一個確實數字來。而中國的歷史呢？不論正史外史，稗官野史，雖都載有各朝代各國家的人口數字，但不用說這更是離實際數目很遠的。不過我們讀史之餘，隨時把牠收集起來，作一個有系統的總計，並加以分析，雖不能說這樣就可以得出中國歷代人口之變遷的實蹟，但也略略可以證明喊代之變亂和興隆對人口之影響，同時也可以爲那些專門研究社會史和經濟史的人提供一點有趣味的材料。</p>
<p>自馬爾薩斯的「人口論」一出，人人便把人口之增殖乃以幾何級數增加這一定律認爲天經地義，甚至於把人羣與人羣，國家與國家，種族與種族之鬥爭，把經濟之發展或停頓，把政治之隆盛或變亂，都歸之於人口定則之所致。如果這樣，那麼人口之停滯不增加，便要從人口本身去找說明了，社會之發展和進化也要爲人口定律所决定了。但是最近二世紀世界各國之人口激增，而古代和中世紀停滯幾千年不變，是甚麼緣故呢？可見用人口來說明人口是得不出答案來的。近代西歐之人口激增，是由於西歐生產之突飛猛進的發展，工商業發達，則經濟力便足以支持更大量的人口，而且也史需要多量的人口來從事生產，所以人口也就增加。反之，在古代及中世紀，世界的經濟都停留於奴隸經濟和封建經濟狀態之中，只有散漫的，小規模的，遲緩的生產，所以不能支持大量的人口，因之人口也不增加。可知人口問題决定於經濟而非經濟决定於人口。明白了這一基本原理，我們才可以研究中國歷史上的人口問題。</p>
<p>我們所根據的書籍主要地是「三通老」卽「文獻通老」，「皇朝通老」，「續通考」。此外也參老各朝的正史，如「史記」，「漢書」之類。還有，我們所研究的只是要得出一個概觀，所以把那極關重要的朝代之轉換期的人口，特別標示出來；至於各朝各年之人口統計，則太爲繁冗，且無關重要，大多省略。其决，因各朝代在政治上都不見得是完全統一的，因之作統計時便只好把各國的同時的記載總加起來，不再計及各國的數目了。也有許多時候，許多國家，對於人口統計全付闕如的，這只有從雜史以及當時政論家的文獻中去老見，但這也就更是一個概數。還有，越到古代，數目越是不準確，這是因爲我們不能像研究近代的那樣，多有參老資料作左證。現在試就三通考來作一個統計：</p>
<p>在夏禹時代，人口的戶數不詳，口數則的爲一千三百五十多萬。周初爲一千三百七十幾萬。兩代相差之數不多，而介於兩代之間的商朝則無從老見。周東遷時爲一千一百九十萬。周末和漢初都闕不可老。從周東遷時人口之减少看，可知當時東周之紛亂，犬戎之入侵，很有關係。戰國時和楚漢爭覇以及漢初，惜乎「三通老」上未載，但從蘇秦和張儀遊說六國之文獻中，也可推知其梗概，雖然有些誇大。蘇秦說燕，趙，韓，齊，皆言帶甲數十萬，於楚則言百萬。張儀說秦之戰土百萬。又以當時之兵車數目亦可證知其兵士之數目。蘇秦說齊，楚，趙，皆言車千乘；燕六百；魏車六百，驗五千；秦車千乘，騎萬匹。如以車一乘，騎十匹而配士卒一千人，則合七國之車騎計算，可得七百萬士卒。又據蘇秦所說，『　淄七萬戶，戶三男子，則臨淄之卒可得二十一萬』。以此推之，七國之衆當合二百多萬戶。如每戶以「八口計之，的可得二千萬人。但還有許多小邦，如宋，衛，中山等都沒有計入，所以戰國時人口的可有二千至三千萬。人們每每以爲戰國時候，因連年戰爭，人口一定漸少。但實際上當時原始的工商經濟非常發達，我們於當時商鞅廢井田，開阡陌一事可以見之，是時　說文化也非常燦爛，經濟發達造成各强國，同時人口也比前增加。不過，我們也得注意：這時所根據的中國版圖早己大於夏周各朝了。</p>
<p>如果研究過社會史的人，就知道在奴隸社會的初期，因爲驅使大批的奴隸去從事生產，不特農業有所改良，就是原始工商業也大爲活躍。西漢時是中國歷史上一個典型的奴隸社會的階段，而且是奴隸社會繁榮時期的階段。比如漢文帝和景帝之富裕，鄧通以一寵幸，兼營什一之利而成富翁。因爲經濟發達，在人口數字上也就大增。西漢末年，卽當王莽之前，人口戶數爲一千二百多萬，口數的六千萬。繼後至漢光武時，人口忽然减少。根據史實，這一個時代是農民叛亂的時代，劉秀（卽光武帝）也是一農民出身，跟着流氓無產者對政府反叛。道時奴隸社會已發展到了飽和點，不能再有進步性了。奴隸經濟制度到了這時也已腐濫，其目身是沒法調治的，所以迫得農民作亂。這時人口也因之激减，戶口只有四百二十幾萬，人口爲二千多萬。</p>
<p>但是奴隸之反抗，對於奴隸社會的政治體制是沒有推翻的可能的，他們始終沒有出路。反叛的結果父爲統治者鎭壓下來，恢復其原狀。但此時奴隸制社會也就奄奄一息，半身不遂，不能再往前發展了。所以當時的人口决不能超過其隆盛時期。計東漢末年戶數爲一千六百多萬，口數爲五千萬。三國時人口最少，只有七百多萬。但這是絕對不正確的。自然因社會之紛亂，如農民（黃巾賊）之擾亂，各國之戰爭而有影響，但也决不能由以前的五千萬而降落到百分之七十幾的。不過從這種劇烈的减少中，也可看出當時社會如照原樣已不能再支持下去了，如果沒有外力的摻入，那自己是會死亡的。同西歐之羅馬帝國一樣，到了末期，必然有外族之侵人，以摻透其生機。如日爾曼人之類。中國也是一樣。自西晋起，便是五胡亂華。社會由此變質，由奴隸社會而變成另一社會（這社會在中國的社會史家還沒有一致的斷語，有些說是封建社會，有些說是過渡時期的社會，前者如王宜昌，後者如陶希聖之類）。以後一直到滿淸鴉片之戰止，都是一樣。所以以後各代的人口，雖有增减，但總差不多，而且封建經濟只是小農經濟，决不能支持好多的人口之生活的。現在試把以後各朝之人口列舉如次：</p>
<p>南北朝末爲一千一百多萬。隋全盛時爲四千六百多萬。唐太宗時不詳，但戶口只有　白多萬。唐玄宗天寳年間爲五千二百萬。宋太祖時爲二千萬。南宋高宗時爲一千九百萬（金不在內），而金的人口則爲二千多萬。元初五千八百萬，元末不詳。明成視時六千六百多萬，以後無多大改變。到了淸朝，人口反而减少，順治十八年爲二千一百萬，康熙五十年爲二千四百萬。但是一至乾隆十四年則一變而爲一萬七千七百萬，到乾隆四十八年又驟增至二萬八千四百萬了。</p>
<p>對於南北朝以後淸朝以前的人口，想來都無多大差誤，而且關係也小。淸初人口一定失實，乾隆初年人口也許是對的，不過剛剛三十年間又驟增到一萬萬以上，這雖可以由征服新疆，開闢疆士來解說，但究不能令人完全置信。不過無論如何，我們也可看出，中國社會經濟到了乾隆時，已由封建經濟之崩潰，到了的業資本經濟之開始了。加以又同海外各國通商，更刺激起本國本商業之發展來，因之才具有給養大量人口的經濟力，而且也才需要這大量的人口。</p>
<p>近百年來，當然人口是在一天天的增加的，如把東四省和蒙藏邊疆計算在內，也許不下四萬萬人。但是最近幾年來，一方面是遭遇着世界經濟恐慌，資本主義在帝國主義本國都碰了壁，那在我們這爲其傾銷之尾閭的半殖民地是要不用說了。經濟停滯了，人口也要停滯的，何况一方面又加以連年水旱天災以及强鄰之呑蝕呢？所以說不定現在的人口巳减少到三萬萬去了。</p>

<h3>日資在冀東的進出</h3>
<p>— 陳沉</p>
<p>河北通縣通訊</p>
<p>（一）冀東銀行之籌備</p>
<p>冀東銀行很早就在協議進行了。日本方面本來預備使它附屬於朝鮮銀行，但繼而以爲在冀察經濟上，朝鮮銀行之出進尙無可能，故改而仰給於滿洲中央銀行。他們還預備有所謂「北支（華北）中央銀行」的設立，而冀東銀行的機能，郤就是華北的過渡的銀行。不過，在目前，它的活動能力還只限於冀東戰區。它的資本暫定五十萬元。據說年內必將成立。</p>
<p>（二）鐘淵紡織公司的Pulp工塲</p>
<p>「鐘淵」是日本有名的紡織托拉斯，而這裏的Pulp工塲又是直轄於日本的「興中公司」的。冀東產葦極多，加之冀東僞政府又給予絕對便利，所以他們早已在這裏設立葦Pulp工塲，據說成續極好。他們爲完成一貫的人造絲工業××計劃，更有所謂第二决計劃，準備增設人造絲及加工工塲，現在他們已經調查完畢，正在積極籌備中了。</p>
<p>（三）東亞烟草公司的新工塲</p>
<p>東亞烟草公司也是日本一個規模很大的烟草公司，他們已决定在秦皇島開設新工塲。這工塲的基地已經收買到二萬坪（一坪等於我國六方尺），準備設置捲烟機二十部，大的不久便可以正式成立了。這工廠的設立據說是受了冀東偽政府的委託的，它得到了冀東烟草專賣權，那是不言可知的了。</p>
<p>現在，日本的零星小商人也都十分注意於冀東的工商業，他們已經組織了一個很大的調查團去實地調查了。</p>

<h3>跳虱做戲和刀鍘活人頭</h3>
<p>— 郎德鈞</p>
<p>跳虱一名虼蚤，是一種不到一顆米大的寄生虫，專門寄生於人和猫狗身上，吮血爲生的。本是最不爲人所歡迎的東西。但在無奇不有的上海，却有了跳虱做戲，而哄動了千幾百人去看牠。同時，在那一個塲所中，還有刀铡活人頭和刀鍘箱中活人等大套魔術。這在去看過的人固不足爲奇，如果沒有親眼看過，倒有値得作爲談助吧？</p>
<p>我是甚麼新奇玩意都要去看看的人，對於道藐小寄生虫的大顯身手，更不能不急欲去看個明白，便到大新公司四樓出了兩角錢門票去參觀。走到裏面，只見圍滿了人的一張大方桌上正在開始跳虱做戲。那張方桌很大，長的八尺，寬的六尺。桌面上正中置有白色板一塊，長的三尺餘，闊約二尺餘。在這塊白板的兩旁，擺列着許多嵌魚骨的福建漆盒子，有圓的，有長方的，有正方的。一個三十來歲，只穿着西裝白襯衫的跳虱指揮者，他捲着兩隻袖子，露出兩條手腕，對着觀衆們坐着，一邊在那些漆盒子內取跳虱出來做戲，一面向觀衆說道：「跳蚤這個東西，壽命常然是再短不過了，但我可以把牠養活一年。現在，我來懸賞九百元，誰能把一個跳虱養活到兩個月，就可以把這五百元送他。」觀衆中便有人說：「牠一跳一跳的逃走了到那里去找呢？」那個養跳虱的人又笑道：「請看！養跳虱是要拴着牠養的！」說着，他右手把着一個小鉗子，左手開開一個漆盒的蓋，把跳虱連繫着頭髮似的那根綫一齊夾出來，舉起來給大家看。又恐怕大家看不淸楚，他又預備了一個小顯微鏡，其實可稱爲小型放大鏡，可以用手舉着看的，他把一個跳虱扣在鏡後，交給大家傳觀，果然一個生龍活虎的跳虱，自得其樂地在那裏打秋千似的等待着。一面大家傳觀跳虱，一面他又在向觀衆說了：「大家看看便當，我拴這根綫可不便當。緊了要把跳虱勒死；鬆了牠一歇歇就逃跑了。我這熟練了的拴跳虱老手，用二十分鐘時間才拴得上。各位先生，恐怕要一兩點鐘才把牠拴得上呢？不相信，試試看。」但當時觀客一個也不答辭。停了一下，一個觀客便發問了：「跳虱喫甚麼呢？」那個跳虱指揮道：「不瞞你說，就乾脆喫我。跳虱喫我的血過活；我又靠牠做戲來養活。牠吃我，我吃牠，一人一半。」話未說完，大家哄堂大笑，哈哈之聲不絕。接着，不說閒話，跳虱戲開塲了。指揮跳虱的人從一個較大的盒子裏，拿出了一輛銅質的小車，不過只有一個小火柴盒一半大，車轅上繫着一個小跳虱，指抓的嘴裏便喊“Oh,Go”果然那小跳虱便一步一步向前走，車也跟着轉動。同時，他又取出一個銅質路輾筒，也如同車子那樣在走。有人便不覺驚奇地問他：「跳虱不是只會跳嗎？誰也沒有看見牠一步步走！你用甚麼法子訓練牠呢？」指揮人道：「請你們看看罷！」一邊說他一邊又到一個盒子裏，取出一個有點像手提香爐似的吊掛物，那是一個小銅練子上掛着一個跳虱：「跳虱不能讓牠儘跳，儘跳要把性命跳黃浦的。所以我首先要使牠習慣了走路。但是如何才能使只會跳的牠學走路呢？於是我就想出這個吊牠的辦法，練子比牠重了幾十倍，使牠想跳却跳不動。又在吊牠的時候注意，使牠的脚仍然可以着地，自然而然牠便會行走了。剛才呌跳虱拖的車子，每一個都比牠本身重兩千倍。試騐多次，使我們曉得跳虱負重力量非常的强。我們試騐過：用一個比牠本身重五百倍的球扣在牠頸上，牠也會一點不吃力地背着！」說着他就把一個小球拿來照樣做給觀衆看。停了一下，他又聲明敎跳虱踢球。先把球從牠頸上取下來放在跳蚤足上，敎牠用足抓住。他又做出聲音敎牠踢走。只要他一　：“Oh,Go！”果然跳蚤就把那球踢出一兩尺外，試了好幾决都一　一踢地奉命惟謹。在這時，指揮者又聲明了，他說：「諸位，每一個跳蚤的頭腦都很簡單，所以每個只能做一種把戲，牠一聽見我的聲音，就會照樣做，可是眞的千篇一律，决翻不出新花樣。」接着，他又拿出一個小圓形的琴，彷彿是一個圓桌樣子。上面平的一大塊桌面常作是跳舞廳，底下的琴可咚可咚響着。他用小鉗子又鉗了四五個跳虱出來，可是這些跳虱，每一個身上都罩着一件衣裳，是一種小圓錐形的漏斗式的特別衣裳。那些小跳虱聽見了音樂的聲音，只是在旋轉着，如同跳草裙舞一樣。此後，他又拿出一座輪盤架子，大的四寸見方，他說：「這中間有一個類似水車的輪盤，重量約有五千倍跳虱那麼重。現在呌一個跳虱來拖動牠。」說着，取出一個跳虱，把牠擺在輪盤下面有一點突出的地方一扣，再由指揮者“Oh,Go”一　　以下接第五版</p>

<p>聲，果然輪盤轉動。不過很微弱地在轉而已。轉完了輪盤，就算跳虱戲做完。因爲來的人前擠後擁，便聽見一個人在另一處高聲喊着：「請看完跳虱戲的先生們到這邊來看刀鍘活人頭。」就在這呼聲中，有一大批人如潮似的擁到刀鍘活人處。在那里，佈置是很陰森而可怕的，彷彿法國大革命時的刑塲一樣。高聳着一座斷頭台，兩根長木柱中間高高懸着一把大鍘刀。那主持這把戲的魔術師，還特別先向大家當面試一試鍘刀落下來的重量。只見他把機鈕一扳，很快的「咯」一聲，那把大刀就吊落下來，震得那座木台都搖動半天。過了一會，一個相當摩登的年靑女子出現在大家眼前，尖尖的檢，很柔順的面容。經那主持者一聲吩咐，他便走到斷頭台後面，把頭伸進了一個凹字形的置放頭顏等待行刑處。這時候，主持者又高聲呌了：「各位看淸楚，不妨再站近前些！眼看我們鍘下這位姑娘的頭來！」這時，有些膽小的人竟不看就走了。我明明曉得那是魔術，不管它用甚麼障眼法，終歸不會眞殺人的。所以更擠到前面去看。只見主持者把那試騐過重懸高的鍘刀機紐再一按，一把大鍘刀便斗然落了下來，看去眞像把那女人的頭鍘下來一般。不過，那女人面不改色，仍然如無事人一樣。其後，那主持者又取出黃布袱一個，抖開來去把人頭一套，說是已把人頭裝到這裏面去了。果然，一霎眼間，那鍘刀下的人頭便不見了。我因爲目的在看跳虱戲，而且時候也不早了，人也擠得利害，便在此時不等大家散去就先走了。關於刀鍘箱中人的那一套我就放棄了沒有看。</p>

<h3>介紹「大衆論壇」</h3>
<p>— 趙異</p>
<p>——上海神州國光社經售，每冊售價一角——</p>
<p>「大衆論壇」，這是最近新出的一個綜合的半月刊。就這期創刊號看來，它的內容確是比較複雜；就中有國際形勢的解說，中國問題的研究，有短小的評論，專門的論著等等。從各篇文字的觀點和其具體內容看來，它都可說是値得一讀的刊物之一種。</p>
<p>當作發刊詞的第一篇文章，是該刊編者王漁邨的「中國出版界最近十年的發個演變傾向」。作者在這中間指出了「一九二六年是中國現代史上的一個劃時期的年度」，並說明了那時的大變動爲中國「文化界出版界開拓了一個新的途徑」，使「中國新興的文化思想，從此乃在文化界出版界確立了支配的地位」。接着又將一九二六年到現在的中國出版界的變化分成三個時期，卽是一九二六年前後數年間爲第一期，一九三一年「九一八」事變前後爲第二期，現在爲第三期；並指出各期的顯著傾向是：「第一期主要是關於世界一般進步社會科學著述的翻譯與介紹；第二期主要是關於中國社會發展史的探究與討論；第三期主要是關於上述兩方面之基本知識的明確化與通俗化」。這樣的劃分和說明也許還有討論的必要，但在目前將問顯這樣的提出以及作者所表現的意見却是値得特別注意的，雖然文中的實際材料還欠充分。</p>
<p>解說國際形勢的文字共有四篇。第一是錢亦石的「世界休戰紀念的十八週年」，這雖是應時的紀念文章，但我們却可從中看到戰後世界所生的新矛盾，以及目前國際間「侵路陣綫」與「和平戰錢」的對立形勢；可說是目前國際形勢的一個總的概括的分析。第二是彭叔美的「繞在西班牙問題上的國際鬥爭」，在這中間，作者除叙述西班牙戰爭的現勢外，並解說不干涉協定的意義，同時更從英國自身的利害關係揭露了倫敦「對西班牙內戰的眞面目」。此外的兩篇則是寄字的「比利時恢復中立的透視」與叔美的「意德的反蘇聯合作」，前者從比利時國內外的形勢分析它恢復中立地位的意義及其影響，後者則說明德意兩國最近的圖謀及其對於世界和平的威脅。</p>
<p>在這期「大衆論壇」中，最値得提說的是研究中國問題的那幾篇文章。如王漁邨的「帝國主義與中國國民經濟的建設」，便很實際地由華北經濟的現狀，中國紡織工業的遭遇，貨幣改革的意義，交通工業的發展與帝國主義在華消售商品的關係，說明依靠侵略國家的資本來發展中國工業的危機，打破了利用帝國主義的資本來和平建設本國經濟的迷夢。不過，依作者的意見，便應很自然地得到一個結論，那便是必要中國民族獲得解放，才能自主地發展我們的國民經濟，中國當前的問題是民族問題，政治問題，而不是單純的經濟問題，可惜作者並未將這點充分明白表現出來，這可說是有點美中不足的。復决是孫懷仁的「大豐之年的糧價飛漲」，這也是依據實際情形，指出「大豐之年糧價飛漲」的兩大原因：通貨膨脹的顧慮與外商大量吸收，並說明牠的危險性的。最後是高素明的「東北義勇軍的本質及其活動」，這不僅使我們知道東北義勇軍一般的奮鬥情形，而且還使我們明瞭東北義勇軍最近的質的變化；凡是關心中國民族解放者，都應一讀此文。</p>
<p>可以作爲專論的「現代靑年論」（蘇丹），也是一篇難得的論文。它是依據日人戶坂潤的論著編譯成的，對於現代靑年的特性和其各方面，作了一個精深的研究和說明。作者說：「隨着時代的演進，現代社會劃分爲二，壯年的靑年時代所處的是一種社會，今日靑年所處的是一種社會。時代不同，社會生活條伴不同，以前靑年只是打算等待時期到了，平平穩穩的作壯年的繼起人，現在他們却因失業與貧困的暗影，或則急於要爬上壯年的社會階梯，或則對壯年所處的旣成社會懷抱不滿；這兩種動向引起與壯年間的尖銳的對敵。」這便是現代許多靑年的不靑年化的說明，也就是「父與子對立時代」的靑年的特徵。接着牠對於現代靑年與一般動勞大衆，婦女的關係，也作了正確的解說，使我們知道，在受社會壓迫一點上他們有怎樣的類似。</p>
<p>郭大力的「中國文化之明日」，是批評張君勵的「自由文化論」的。作者於此先從社會的見地說明了張先生的「自由文化論」之本質；跟着又從社會文化之辯蹬的發展，批判了張先生調和怯弱的建立中國新文化的方法之錯誤，說「新文化必須是舊文化的否定」，「徹底的批判是新文化建立的唯一的方法，保守必然是文化的破滅」。這都是很正確的見解。但關於中國在整個資本主義沒落之際是否還有可能建立資本主義文化，關於張君勵的理論究竟是什麼人的意識的反映，作者都沒有明確的表示，充分的說明，這使我們不能史明白了解作者的意見究竟如何。</p>
<p>此外，這一期的「大衆論壇」還有短小的言論，國內外通訊，文藝論著等文字，都是比較可看的。</p>
<p>說到我們對該刊的希望，也有幾點：一，綜合的刊物，內容還要複雜和充實，使讀者可以從中得到多方面的知識；二，這樣的刊物應該具有充分的戰鬥性，論戰文字應該多登，不然，就太平凡化了；三，當此民族解放問題成爲最重大的問題之際，應該以很大的力量來喚醒中國民衆，努力於救亡運動。</p>

<h3>西貢一日遊（完）</h3>
<p>— 銘女士</p>
<p>我們戚戚然地吿別了敎務主任，便乘電車一直上動物園去。西貢的動物園不要門票，無論貧富責賤，任何人都可自由入內。這園佔地的有二三百畝，凡屬熱帶特產的植物和動物無一不備。我們於中秋已過，丹桂飄香的時候離國，而到這裏却又看見盛開的荷花在池水上顧影自憐，想不到今年竟過了兩個夏季——園內最多的動物是猴，大大小小裝在一籠不下八九十隻。這籠沒有籠頂，所以這些「人類的始祖」常常得蹤耀出來滿園亂跑，在遊客手中搶食物吃。猴以外是龜，說起這裏面的龜，竟有大得像神話似的。同行的葉君有點近視，又胖，在園內走了一轉，倦了，很想找個石磴坐一坐，他東尋西尋，一眼瞥見靑草地上有個八仙桌大小的黃褐色的石塊，高興極了，便跑去坐，那知還未走到跟前，那八仙桌就自動地向池邊雍容爾雅地走去了，原來那是一隻大「忘八」——</p>
<p>我們在園內看飽了那些奇花異禽，猛獅馴象以後，由園的後門踱了出來，那時已是下午四時左右，但日光却還非常强烈。園的後面很僻靜，在那些大樹的蔭下有不少的安南土人正在濃郁地做着好夢，他們的睡臉上顯得非常適意悠閑，好像除了此時此刻得到一點舒適之外，便不再想旁的什麼似的。離園的後門不遠，有一個法國人辦的小學，是專供安南人的子弟進的，一切費用都免，還送衣服鞋帽，所以人數很多。我們沒有進內去參觀，只站在路上從窗中望進去，看見一個安南的靑年，正執着敎鞭在敎一班年齡不過十歲左右的兒童的法文；用來解釋的當然還是安南語，但聽他唸的法文却眞是純熟。他看見我們一行人在注視他，臉上顯出了很得意的顏色，好像說：「看，法國人也重用我呢——」我們從同船的一位法國敎士口中，已知道安南靑年的一個模糊的輪廓，他們中無錢的根本不唸書識字，成天爲生活作牛馬，有錢的則進法國學堂，學得頂括括的法文後便到法國去留學，但法國人却只允許他們學化學，醫藥之類的科目，凡法律，政治，經濟等都不讓他們學習，等他們學成歸國之後，便派他們做敎師，醫師或藥劑師等等職務。</p>
<p>船在西貢停了四天，我只在這兒遊了一日，心裏就充塞了煩悶，其餘三天都沒有上岸去，在看書之餘，便獨立船頭，遠眺西貢的全景——這號稱東方「夢之國」的樂園，對於它的本族子孫及它的近族的中國人說來，實在已經不是樂園了！</p>

<h3>四川菜和川戲（一）</h3>
<p>— 姚陳沙</p>
<p>一說到四川菜，有些人的舌頭就要發癢。的確，四川菜的主要特點之一，便是那使人的味覺器官受到一種莫名其妙的刺激的辛辣味道。假使要絕對禁止四川廚子用辣味，那不管他的技術怎樣高强，有許多菜也是要做不好的。至於四川戲，那是最近才從遙遠的幾千里之外，從　門以內搬出來的；它的主要特點除了關於戲劇表演的方面外，便是採用大鑼大鼓的音樂，打動起來，特別吵人，特別震動人的耳鼓，說來也有着很大的刺激性。假使說四川人的性情好動不好靜，剛强而不柔順，好鬥而不願受辱，那在川菜和川戲方面大概也可以得到一部分對於川人的性格的說明吧。</p>
<p>就最近的情形看來，四川菜好像有日益發展的樣子。你看，原來非常冷靜的華格臬路現在不是很熱鬧了嗎？當你在午飯或晚餐時候走過這條馬路時，卽可看到將近十家的接連着的川菜館都有許多人在那裏小吃或大嚼。雖然我們還不知道那些菜館的營業狀况究竟如何，但在一個短時期之內，在一個地方，居然出現了這麼多的同一性質的菜館，並且居然有這麼多的人去下顧生意，那情形也就很可觀了。至於四川戲呢？我們知道過去曾在新光大戲院開鑼，可是不久就停息了：現在又捲土重來，在大華舞廳樓上演唱，據說還能賣座，但不管怎樣，比較起川菜的發展情形來，總是有點遜色的。這是什麼道理呢？每一個知道川菜和川戲的人都要發生這個疑問。我以爲首先應該注意的便是那所謂「刺激性」的問題。（未完）</p>

<h3>Bandit Troops' Remnants Concentrate at Bailingmiao; Front Line Quiet with Only Sentry Gunfire; Situation Tense in Northern Sui Province; War Imminent; Fu Zuoyi's Reply to De Wang Stern; Sui Provincial Government Cables Yan [Xishan] Regarding Aircraft Bombing Our Troops; Seventy to Eighty Officers and Soldiers Wounded, Seventeen Vehicles Destroyed</h3>
<p>(Guihua) Northern Sui is more tense. Reinforcements have been arriving at Bailingmiao for days, preparing to advance south and invade Wuchuan. Currently, there are no changes. After suffering heavy losses, the bandits have not disturbed us in twenty-one days. Prince A returned to Sui from Bing[zhou] on the twenty-first morning and reported to [Fu] Zuoyi in the afternoon regarding his visit to Chiang [Kai-shek] and Yan [Xishan], and discussed strategies for suppressing the bandits. (Twenty-second morning special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A dispatch from Jining states that puppet troops are gradually gathering towards Wuchuan, Taolin, and the Hetao area, with their main force at Wuchuan. Their future strategy will be to encircle us, and they plan to move to the side of Baotou, cutting off the Wuyuan connection, and attacking the rear of Guihua, the provincial capital of Sui. A certain military headquarters has recently moved its air force base to Bailingmiao for convenient bombing during the general offensive. If the puppet troops fail again, they will inevitably resort to guerrilla tactics, disturbing our border and avoiding formal battles. (Twenty-first special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A dispatch from Jining states that the enemy on the Wuchuan front, seeing the defeat of the puppet troops between Xinghe and Taolin and the loss of contact, are retreating to Bailingmiao to await opportunities. The cavalry brigade of Zhang Junzhe's puppet Jehol troops is moving towards that area. (Twenty-first special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) De Wang sent a telegram to Fu Zuoyi, who replied on the eighth. The reply was released on the twentieth. Fu Zuoyi's telegram was extremely tactful in its wording, but his attitude was stern and firm. Judging from the telegrams from both sides, the outbreak of war in northern Sui is feared to be imminent. (Twenty-first special dispatch)</p>
<p>Sui Provincial Government Announcement: Foreign Nationals to Withdraw</p>
<p>(Guihua) The bandits who attacked Hongge'ertu in eastern Sui have been completely routed. The bandit suppression work has temporarily come to an end. Fu Zuoyi returned to Sui from Pingdiquan with Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zeng Yan'yi on the twentieth. The situation in northern Sui became more tense on the twentieth. Two thousand puppet bandit troops have been reinforced at Bailingmiao, and an attack is feared to be launched within days. On the twentieth, the Sui Provincial Government announced that all foreign nationals residing in Sui Province must withdraw from Sui territory. Otherwise, the province will not be responsible for any damages. (Twentieth special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sources state that the bandit troops invading Sui comprise approximately 7,000 men under Wang Ying, 6,000 under Li Shouxin, 3,000 under Bao Yueqing, 2,000 plus under Jin Jiasan, 2,000 under Zhang Wanqing, and 3,000 Mongolian security troops under Zhuosh Hai, totaling less than 25,000 men. Except for Li's troops, whose weapons are relatively well-equipped, the rest have only half the necessary firearms. Currently, the bandits, having failed in eastern Sui, know that our defenses are strong and impregnable. Therefore, they have abandoned their positions west of Shangdu and turned towards northern Sui, attempting to unite with Mongolian bandits and invade Ningxia, Alashan, and Ejin Banner along the Daqing Mountains in the west, in order to implement their strategy of advancing in battle and retreating in defense. Each company in the bandit ranks has one or two instructors from a certain party. It is also rumored that 20,000 puppet troops have arrived from Shenyang and are preparing to move west, said to be subordinates of Zhang Hai Peng and others. (Twenty-first Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>After the Bandit Army's Defeat, Regiment Commander Executed</p>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) After the bandit puppets attacked Sui and were defeated: (1) The city gates of Shangdu were tightly closed, and 10,000 catties of flour were requisitioned from each district, with only one-tenth of the price paid. When Wang Ying retreated from Hongge'ertu, he wept bitterly to his subordinates at Tuchengzi. Regiment Commander Zhao Dazhong was executed by Wang on the eighteenth for the defeat. There are currently two regiments of Li Shouxin's troops and twenty aircraft in the city. (2) Zhang Wanqing's troops, who attacked Xinghe at Nanhaoqian, received ten trucks of military supplies from Zhangbei on the twentieth. 1,600 men from Li's troops reinforced them. (3) A certain regiment and 10,000 bandit troops have been arriving in Duolun from Rehe for days, moving westward in stages. (4) Twelve trucks of gasoline arrived in Kangbao from Zhangbei on the twentieth, and sixteen wooden boxes arrived from Duolun, each four feet long and wide. It is unknown what they contain. (Twenty-first special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The two bandit units of Li Shouxin and Wang Ying, who attacked Sui, have suffered greatly since being defeated by the National Army at Hongge'ertu. They are afraid, but the manipulators are still urging them on vigorously. Wang has now concentrated the remnants of the bandits in the Shangdu area and plans to invade northern Sui within the week. (Twenty-first Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A dispatch from Suiyuan states that the puppet bandit troops near Xinghe in eastern Suiyuan were routed by the National Army and are in a terrible state. In the past two days, the front line has been quiet except for sentry gunfire. The situation has calmed down. After this setback, the puppet bandits are being reorganized with the assistance of a certain party. It is expected that they will not be able to launch a large-scale attack again in the short term. Remnants of the puppet Mongolian bandit troops are now concentrating at Bailingmiao, with a tendency to counterattack from northern Sui. Aircraft from a certain party are still flying over our troops' positions for reconnaissance but have not dropped bombs. This morning, around 10:00 AM, aircraft were conducting reconnaissance over Zhuozi Mountain, Pingdiquan, and other places, circling for about half an hour before flying away. Bao Yueqing, who is staying in Bailingmiao, has been summoned by De Wang to Jiabusi to meet with De Wang and discuss everything. It is rumored that they intend to use Mongolian bandits to harass northern Sui. (Twenty-first special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) The Sui Provincial Government cabled Yan [Xishan] on the twenty-first at noon that when our troops advanced towards Twelve Sumu today, they were five li away from Gaojiadi in Xikangtongyu when they were suddenly attacked by multiple aircraft from a certain party, which bombed them at low altitude, dropping over a hundred bombs, wounding seventy to eighty of our officers and soldiers, destroying seventeen vehicles, and burning two. We shot down one enemy aircraft. (Twenty-first special dispatch)</p>
<p>Bandit Puppet Plainclothes Troops Fleeing to Shangdu</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A dispatch from Jining states that the enemy in eastern Sui plans to use a surprise attack to bypass the Ping-Sui Railway between Jining and Juezhen in order to cut off our Jin-Sui connection. We have now concentrated troops in Fengzhen and Datong, establishing contact. As of the night of the twentieth, puppet plainclothes troops appeared between Fengzhen. After our search, they could not hide and fled towards Shangdu. (Twenty-first special dispatch)</p>
<p>Counterfeit Organization Leaflets Discovered in Tianjin</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Leaflets to aid the puppet advance on Suiyuan were discovered in the city of Tianjin on the twenty-first, distributed by a counterfeit organization hired by a certain concession, along with oaths from Wang Ying, the counterfeit commander-in-chief of the Great Han Righteous Army, and Zhang Mingzhi, the counterfeit political minister. The authorities are on guard against traitors taking the opportunity to incite chaos and have tightened security. (Twenty-first special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) City authorities stated today that someone was distributing leaflets in the city, and rumors have resurfaced. Although some people are thinking of taking the opportunity to create disturbances, winter defense has already been implemented and prevention is strict, so there will be no surprises. (Twenty-first special dispatch)</p>
<p>Fu Zuoyi Rewards Meritorious Generals and Soldiers</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A dispatch from Jining states that because our army's division commander Peng Yubin, brigade commander Dong Qiwu, regiment commander Zhang Peixun, deputy regiment commander Zhang Zhao, and garrison commander Zhang Cunde won a victory with fewer soldiers than the enemy at Hongge'ertu, killing the enemy and rendering meritorious service, Fu [Zuoyi] issued a commendation and awarded cash prizes ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 yuan to each officer, graded accordingly, and also presented it to the Jin-Sui Office for review and reward. All other officers and soldiers who contributed will receive at least one yuan each, to be investigated and collected by their respective superiors. (Twenty-first special dispatch)</p>
<p>Wang Ying and Other Bandit Units Undergoing Reorganization and Reform</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A dispatch from Jining states that the puppet units of Wang Ying, Li Shouxin, Jin Jiasan, and Yin Baoshan have all retreated to Shangdu for reorganization and reform. The military headquarters of a certain party is quite dissatisfied with the failure of the puppet army to attack Hongge'ertu and Nanhaoqian and is strictly supervising the reorganization and replenishment. It has also transferred some directly subordinate troops from the First and Second Military Regions of the puppet Manchukuo under Yu Shenzheng and Ji Xing to be incorporated into the puppet army to enhance its strength. The general offensive will be delayed by about ten days. (Twenty-first special dispatch)</p>
<p>Eighteenth Day Battle: We Overcome the Many with the Few</p>
<p>(Beiping) Although there have been frequent battles in the Suiyuan area for several weeks, with aircraft, armored vehicles, and heavy artillery participating in the offensive, the Chinese army's defense line remains firm and unmoved. The "Manchu"-Mongolian troops invading from Chahar province have made no progress. Yesterday, a battle occurred in the Xinghe area, and the Suiyuan army repelled the invading enemy forces four times. The "Manchu"-Mongolian army immediately retreated three miles east. According to Chinese sources, a railway bridge between Fengzhen and Pingdiquan on the Ping-Sui Railway was destroyed by plainclothes troops last night, causing the Ping-Bao express train to be delayed for about four hours. However, it has now returned to normal. Today, the first news from foreigners in the Suiyuan front reached here, confirming the Sui army's counterattack against the invading enemy forces on the eighteenth of this month was a great victory. According to a highly reliable foreign traveler who arrived in Beiping, on the morning of the eighteenth, 3,000 "Manchu"-Mongolian troops attacked a village near Pingdiquan. Gunfire was clearly heard. The village was defended by only 400 Suiyuan soldiers. Despite the disparity in numbers, they were able to hold their ground and await the arrival of reinforcements. They then bravely counterattacked, repelling the attacking army and inflicting considerable losses. The foreigner also stated that several aircraft assisted the "Manchu"-Mongolian army during the attack, and the bombs they dropped were not ordinary bombs, but mostly hand grenades, which were not very effective. The number of invading troops was said to be between 15,000 and 20,000, all poorly uniformed and looking malnourished. It is said that the number of Suiyuan defenders is greater than this. According to Chinese sources, Wang Ying, the leader of the Mongolian mixed troops, narrowly escaped death during the battle on the eighteenth, because the Chinese counterattacking troops pursued the enemy forces to the location where Wang had set up his headquarters, and Wang was almost killed. Currently, Fu Zuoyi, the chairman of Suiyuan Province, has returned to Guihua and is warmly welcomed by the people because Fu inspected the border defenses in Pingdiquan. According to news from Guihua, many fresh troops have arrived in the Suiyuan army and may counterattack Shangdu in Chahar province, the base of operations for the "Manchu"-Mongolian army. (Twenty-first Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>The Destroyed Railway Bridge Has Been Repaired and Traffic Has Resumed</p>
<p>(Guihua) On the evening of the twentieth, Wang Zewu, the chief secretary of Fu Zuoyi, relayed and released a statement saying that the bandits invading eastern Sui originally planned to launch a general offensive against us on the eighteenth, advancing in three routes. Unexpectedly, our infantry, cavalry, and artillery reinforcements arrived at Hongge'ertu at 2:00 AM on the eighteenth and attacked the bandit stronghold of Dalacun, which belongs to Shangdu, directly attacking the bandit headquarters. The bandits responded in a panic, suffered heavy losses, and retreated in defeat.

<h3>Our Army Recaptures Gulang; Pursuing and Annihilating Bandits Toward Liangzhou; Several Thousand Bandits Killed, Two Thousand Guns Seized; A Great Victory Since the Beginning of the General Offensive</h3>
<p>(Lanzhou) The National Army has achieved great victories in pursuing and annihilating the remnants of the bandits on both the east and west banks of the Yellow River. In two days, as many as four thousand bandits were killed and no less than two thousand guns were seized. This is unprecedented since the beginning of the general offensive. The remnants in eastern Gansu are now fleeing to the borders of Shaanxi, Gansu, and the Ordos League in Inner Mongolia. The remnants in western Gansu, only five thousand or so, are now fleeing between Liangzhou and Gulang. Liangcheng is firmly defended by Ma Bufang's troops and there is no cause for concern. The National Army has crossed the river and recovered Gulang and is pursuing and annihilating the bandits toward Liangzhou. The details are as follows: (1) On the fifteenth, our army attacked Yuwang in three routes along the line to Ketangxin. When they occupied the county seat, the pseudo Fourth Army and the Thirty-First Army fled to Mengcheng and Tianshuibao, dozens of miles east of Yuwang, using strongholds to stubbornly resist. On the seventeenth, our army advanced east from Yuwang to suppress them. At noon, they engaged the bandits near the Shiban Bridge west of Mengcheng. The battle was extremely fierce. Our army bravely attacked and fought fiercely until the evening, killing two pseudo regiment commanders and more than 2,000 bandit officers and soldiers. The prisoners are being identified. On the eighteenth, a unit of our army once again surrounded and attacked from the left flank. After two hours of fierce fighting, the bandits were unable to withstand and retreated to the Tianshuibao fortress and nearby fortifications. Our army is now surrounding and intercepting them and will soon be able to wipe them out in one fell swoop. (2) The remnants of the Jingtai bandits in western Gansu were pursued and annihilated by our army and fled west from Dajingbao to between Gulang and Liangzhou. On the morning of the nineteenth, our army launched a general offensive against the bandits in Gulang in several routes and engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Our officers and soldiers bravely attacked and fought fiercely for seven hours before finally recapturing the city of Gulang, killing over a thousand bandits and seizing six or seven hundred rifles and more than ten machine guns. The bandits are demoralized. The mopping-up operation is now underway. (Twentieth Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Lanzhou) The National Army achieved great victories in pursuing and suppressing the remnants of the bandits in both the eastern and western sections. After the victories in the Gulang area on the seventeenth and nineteenth, another great victory was achieved on the evening of the nineteenth. The details are as follows: (1) At noon on the nineteenth, our cavalry outflanked the high mountains north of Gulang, cutting off the bandit troops, and fought a bloody battle for several hours, approaching the city walls. Our officers and soldiers fought bravely, and the bandits could not withstand them. At the same time, a unit of our army attacked from the outside, attacking from both sides, and won a great victory, killing countless bandits, seizing three machine guns, two Mauser pistols, and over a hundred rifles, capturing over two hundred bandits, and capturing over ten female bandits. According to their testimony, the bandits in Gulang had suffered heavy casualties and were collapsing, and they are now being pursued and suppressed. (2) When our army attacked the bandits in Tianshuibao and Mengcheng on the seventeenth, the bandits rushed out from the mountain valleys on the north and south sides, surrounding our flanks in dense formations, and attacked dozens of times. Our officers and soldiers fought bravely from noon to Shen Shi (3-5 pm), which was extremely tragic, killing over 2,000 bandits, capturing over 300 bandit officers and soldiers, seizing over 700 rifles, four automatic rifles, one grenade launcher, and four company and battalion flags. On the eighteenth, our army once again surrounded and attacked from the flanks, and the bandits were even more unable to withstand and retreated into the Tianshuibao fortress and the northeast highlands. Our army took advantage of the situation and launched a fierce attack, occupying Tianshuibao at the You Shi hour (5-7 pm), seizing a great number of enemy troops. The bandits took advantage of the night to flee to the Shanchengbao and Yanchi areas. Our army is now pursuing them closely. (Twenty-first Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3>The People of Xiamen Warmly Support Suiyuan; Student Movement Was Extremely Quiet; This Action Is Unprecedented</h3>
<p>Correspondence from Xiamen: Since the outbreak of the Suiyuan War, the people of Xiamen have been donating funds to support it enthusiastically. On the 17th, the executive committee of the Student Self-Government Association of Xiamen University decided that all students would donate funds to comfort the Suiyuan soldiers. On the 18th, the general meeting of all students decided that each student would donate 5 yuan. All 303 students donated a total of 1,515 yuan, which was paid by the school from the student compensation preparation item. It was immediately remitted by telegraph to Chairman Fu of Suiyuan by the Bank of China to comfort the soldiers on the front lines. In addition, all teachers and students of the school were mobilized and divided into 30 teams to go to Xiamen Gulangyu Heshan urban and rural areas to raise funds for three days from the 19th. Chen Deheng, the Dean of the Faculty of Law, was appointed as the accountant, and 20,000 receipts were printed for use.</p>
<p>On the 18th, the General Chamber of Commerce invited various trade associations to discuss the promotion of one-day contributions to donate funds to purchase aircraft. During the meeting, a motion was made to donate funds to comfort the Suiyuan Patriotic Soldiers. The various trade associations donated a total of 4,500 yuan on the spot, which was immediately remitted to Suiyuan, and a "Xiamen City Business Circle Comfort Suiyuan Patriotic Soldiers Fundraising Committee" was formed. The responsible persons of the various trade associations were responsible for raising funds from the merchants of their respective industries from the 20th to the 24th for five days. Hong Hongru, Huang Yishou, and others were appointed to be responsible for soliciting donations from various banks, companies, shipping companies, wealthy merchants, and giants. In addition, various highway automobile companies in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou, and primary and secondary schools in Xiamen and Gulangyu, also voluntarily reduced food consumption and solicited donations from family and friends, sending them to the municipal government or directly to the Central Bank or entrusting newspaper offices to remit them. In general, they were donating funds to purchase aircraft in addition to donating to support Suiyuan. The trend was overwhelming. On the 18th, various trade associations in Xiamen and the Zhanglong Road Automobile Company donated a total of 61,065 yuan. On the 19th, they were even more enthusiastic and universal. A total of more than 6,700 yuan was donated on the first day, and a total of more than 12,860 yuan was obtained in two days.</p>
<p>The principals of various middle schools in Xiamen jointly decided on the 19th to mobilize all students in middle and higher schools in the city to raise funds from the city for three days from the 21st. In addition to raising funds for one day on the 19th, Xiamen University also stopped waiting to hold the event at the same time as the various middle schools. It is known that Xiamen is located in a special location and is limited by its environment. In the past, student and mass movements were so quiet as to be non-existent. This support for Suiyuan is unprecedentedly enthusiastic. It is probably because the people of Xiamen have the deepest "external feelings" and the greatest tolerance due to the environmental relationship, so when the opportunity arises, they pour out their patriotic enthusiasm, just like a river that cannot be restrained.

<h3>The Countryside of Changshu (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Jin Yong</p>
<p>The Life of Farmers</p>
<p>The life of farmers in Changshu can be viewed in three aspects: In the southeastern villages, because it is all paddy fields, every farmer must go to the fields to learn many techniques such as water bail and rice transplanting. Men and women alike must possess this skill. Therefore, before a woman gets married, the man's family must ask if she knows how to "make a living," that is, whether she can go to the fields and work barefoot and with exposed legs like a man.</p>
<p>In the northwestern villages, because the land is slightly higher and there are fewer rivers and ports, the acreage planted is half rice and half cotton, and the work in the fields is more complicated. Generally speaking, men are in charge of the work in the paddy fields, and women are in charge of the work in the cotton fields. While the men are singing rice-planting songs, the women are hoeing in another cotton field.</p>
<p>In the sandbar area along the Yangtze River, the life of farmers is a different scene. Because more cotton fields are planted there, the farmers' strength is concentrated on planting cotton. That area often suffers from floods and typhoons, and the life of farmers is more difficult than in the two previous villages. However, when a good harvest comes, a joyful and encouraging atmosphere is rarely seen elsewhere.</p>
<p>Heaven and Hell</p>
<p>The gentry of Changshu stand in the clouds enjoying the blessings in their grand halls, while many farmers groan in pain in hell.</p>
<p>Changshu has an overpopulation, so the land cultivated per household is very small. According to the situation in the author's hometown—the northwestern villages—each household averages between five and ten mu. If a family has ten mu of self-cultivated land, it is considered a well-off family in the countryside; fifty mu is considered a small rich man in the village. A family of five, cultivating ten mu of land, averages two shi of white rice per mu, totaling ten shi, of which six to ten shi must be paid as rent rice. The remaining rice is for the consumption of a family of five, which is sometimes not enough. As for the money for seeds and fertilizer, it is impossible to cope without borrowing. A family of five, old and young, work hard for a year, and the result is only enough to make a living. If the year is good, they can recover some of the cost of seeds and fertilizer. If they encounter famine, they will have to go hungry. Under such circumstances, the farmers have already entered the hunger line, and it is even more extravagant to expect them to improve agricultural tools, plant superior varieties, and be clean and hygienic.</p>
<p>Generally, farmers cannot circulate financially and do not have money to buy seeds and fertilizers, so they often cannot cultivate and plant in time, which reduces the harvest. Some farmers can borrow dozens of dollars, but at least they have to pay interest monthly, plus various handling fees. Therefore, once a farmer is in debt, it is impossible to pay it off under high interest rates.</p>
<p>In recent years, famine, hunger, and poverty have made farmers lose their loyalty, honesty, and docility. They have nothing to pawn and nowhere to borrow. Therefore, they have taken actions of defaulting on rent and demanding rent reduction from landlords. Although the doors of the landlords' warehouses are open, there are very few people paying rent. The threats of rent collectors and the arrests of yamen runners are useless. A long string of farmers are detained in the detention center. Last year and the year before, several hundred tenant farmers were detained in the detention center. However, "oil cannot be squeezed out of stones," and the farmers' blood and sweat have dried up.</p>

<h3>The Mania of Military Expansion</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>According to a Geneva dispatch from the National News Agency, based on the League of Nations' 1936 Armaments Yearbook, the expenses for military armaments of various countries in the world have recently become even greater than before. In 1935, the total amount of military expenses worldwide reached 5.4 billion yuan (US dollars). In 1934, it was only 4.9 billion yuan. In 1913, it was only 2.5 billion yuan. It can be seen that the recent mania of military expansion in various countries in the world has reached the highest peak in human history.</p>
<p>The ultimate result of such military expansion is undoubtedly a major international war. The cruelty of this decisive war, judging solely from the quantity of existing armaments in various countries, can be determined to exceed previous wars by countless times. But knowing that such a cruel disaster lies ahead, why do so many countries act like blind men on blind horses, rushing straight into that terrifying abyss? In war, the most suffering are the innocent people. Why don't the billions of people in various countries in the world think of some active rescue measures when such a great disaster is imminent? These two questions are even more worthy of concern for the people in our semi-colonial country, for the Chinese people who have many compatriots already being trampled and slaughtered by war-crazed aggressors.</p>
<p>The current mania of various countries expanding their armaments started in 1931. After the Manchurian Incident in 1931, the balance of power in the Pacific was completely shaken. On the one hand, the aggressor Japan spared no effort to loot all its resources to support its aggressive machinery. On the other hand, other countries along the Pacific coast also rapidly strengthened their own armaments for their own interests. In 1933, Hitler seized power in Germany. His military fascist policy, on the one hand, turned the entire German nation into a large barracks, and on the other hand, step by step, destroyed the Treaty of Versailles, which maintained the European international balance of power after the war. As a result, the whole of Europe was threatened by war, and all countries had to strengthen their own defenses for their own safety. In 1935, Italy, which also belonged to the fascist forces, launched the war of aggression against Abyssinia, regardless of all international treaty constraints. This war has continued until this year, spreading seeds of military conflict everywhere in Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Balkan Peninsula in Southern Europe. It has given a strong stimulus to the military expansion of various countries. Recently, the intervention of several fascist countries in the Spanish war, the cooperation of Germany and Italy in the Central European struggle, and the news of the conclusion of an alliance between Japan and Germany, two major military adventure countries in the East and West, all indicate that international tensions have reached an extraordinary level in the tide of military expansion. War is imminent.</p>
<p>However, in terms of the actual situation, except for a few military fascist countries such as Japan, Germany, and Italy, most countries do not hope for the outbreak of war. However, for the prevention of the imminent war, many countries only focus on strengthening their own armaments, forgetting to unite the forces of peace to resist the aggressors of war mania, which is obviously not enough. Therefore, the League of Nations has become an agency with only a name, and the collective security system has suffered successive blows. Now, the continuous expansion of military expenses in various countries has also increased the infinite suffering of the people in various countries. If this continues to develop into an unprecedented great war in the future, it will truly be the greatest tragedy in human history.</p>
<p>Obviously, the current tide of military expansion in the world is precisely indicating that various countries do not yet have a full understanding of the efforts to defend peace and prevent war. Only by working hard on the road of collective peace can mankind reduce the pain suffered from cruel wars.</p>
<h3>The Locarno Question: Content of the Second British Note, Advocating Simultaneous Discussion of East and West European Issues, New Treaty Must Be Based on the League of Nations Covenant, German Ambassador to Britain Returns Home for Consultations</h3>
<p>(London) According to responsible sources, the British government sent a note to the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty, namely the governments of Germany, Italy, France, and Belgium, on November 19. The main content of the note is to clarify that the five-nation Locarno Conference is not sufficient without discussing the East European issue together with the West European issue, and firmly states that the East European issue should be resolved simultaneously with the West European issue. In addition, the note firmly states that the new Locarno Treaty must be linked to the League of Nations Covenant. Germany previously replied to the British note, advocating that only France and Belgium should conclude a non-aggression treaty, while Germany's security should be guaranteed by Britain and Italy. The current British note argues that the guaranteeing country and the guaranteed country should be completely mutual. The British note also suggests that the implementation of the security guarantee obligations contained in the new Locarno Treaty should be an exception in the event that the attacked country itself violates the Kellogg-Briand Pact. According to the previous German reply, objections were raised to the original provisions of the Locarno Treaty, which stated that an exception should be made in the event that the attacked country violated the League of Nations Covenant. However, although Germany has withdrawn from the League of Nations, it still recognizes the validity of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Therefore, the current British note specifically suggests the above-mentioned exception method. In addition, the Italian reply advocates that the guaranteeing country and the guaranteed country should be mutual. In other words, if Italy assumes the responsibility of guaranteeing the security of other countries, it must also be guaranteed by other countries. The current British note will inquire again whether Italy's so-called mutual guarantee refers only to the guaranteeing country and the guaranteed country, or also includes the guaranteeing country and the guaranteeing country. This point needs to be further clarified by Italy. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<h3>German-Austrian Negotiations Concluded: Economic Alliance Will Be Revived, Germany Exchanges Military Supplies for Austrian Products, New Trade Agreement Will Be Discussed Again at the Beginning of Next Month</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Austrian Foreign Minister Dr. Schuschnigg came here, the first official report of Austrian cabinet members to Germany in four years, and has completed his mission today. According to a press release, Dr. Schuschnigg met with German Foreign Minister Neurath several times to discuss the political, economic, and cultural aspects of the two countries. The two sides had harmonious opinions and decided to convene a meeting in Vienna on December 7 to conclude a new trade agreement in order to increase bilateral trade. The purpose of Dr. Schuschnigg's visit to Germany this time was to seek an economic compromise with Germany so that Austria's large-scale rearmament efforts could be realized. It is now agreed that Germany should purchase Austria's surplus milk and timber, both of which are urgently needed by Germany. Austria will purchase military aircraft, tanks, and heavy artillery from Germany. The former's negotiations were deadlocked because Germany wanted to purchase Austrian goods at low prices. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt's visit to Germany has been completed. Today, he and German Minister to Austria Papen took a plane back to Vienna. Foreign Minister Neurath and Chancellor Hitler's representative, Secretary-General of the Prime Minister's Office Messner, all went to the airport to see them off. Before his departure, Schmidt issued a statement saying, "The results of this visit to Berlin further prove that although there have been slight disputes between Germany and Austria in recent years, the unity of the two countries' races will never be broken because of this." Schmidt then expressed his gratitude for the warm hospitality of Chancellor Hitler, Aviation Minister Goering, and Foreign Minister Neurath, and said, "Thanks to Foreign Minister Neurath's friendly attitude and his rich diplomatic experience, we have been able to raise many outstanding issues between Germany and Austria, exchange opinions, and reach a common understanding on the principles and how to practically resolve them in the near future. What is even more important is that our meeting this time has found a way to strengthen the German-Austrian agreement and prepare for a more complete future. German Chancellor Hitler recognizes the great achievements of Austria's construction efforts, and Austria also expresses sympathy for Germany's actions to establish honor, freedom, and justice throughout the world. Sixteen years ago, I studied at the University of Berlin. I have witnessed the ups and downs of Germany from defeat to recovery." Finally, he said that the German-Austrian Agreement is actually a preparation for the progress of the entire Germanic nation. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<h3>Madrid Area: Rain and Snow Fill the Roads, War Stagnates, Both Armies Only Use Rifles and Machine Guns to Shoot, Rebels Promise to Expand the Neutral Zone</h3>
<p>Madrid: It rained in Madrid today, and the visibility was poor. Rebel planes did not continue to bomb, and the military activities around the capital were not as intense as in the past few days. Residents took advantage of this temporary cessation of hostilities to busy themselves with clearing the debris blocking the streets so that firefighters and paramedics could carry out their work during the next plane bombing. Those with the danger of collapsing were pushed down, the bomb craters were filled, and the rubble was removed. Refugees carrying furniture fled to safe areas in an endless stream. The fighting near the Modelo Prison was intermittent, but both sides mostly used rifles and machine guns to attack each other. Occasionally, artillery fire was heard, and there were no significant changes in the positions in various places. There was heavy wind and snow in the Guadarrama Mountains and the Gredos Mountains north of Madrid. In some places, the snow was as deep as 20 inches, so the war had to be suspended temporarily (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>Avila: A special dispatch from our reporter, the weather in the vicinity of Madrid suddenly turned cold today, and the rain did not melt. The National Army had to stop advancing and only used heavy artillery to bombard the central and southern districts of Madrid, taking the opportunity to consolidate its positions. The National Army authorities here hope that the weather will improve in the evening so that they can continue to take the offensive. As for the government army, although it has attempted to counterattack, it is only a local action and not a comprehensive battle plan. In short, there is no doubt that the current war situation is that the National Army is taking the initiative (Havas dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The restaurants here today posted notices saying "Goods Sold Out" due to the blockage of traffic between the capital and the provinces and the interruption of food sources. An Associated Press reporter witnessed many women and children crying and wailing in the streets and alleys because they could not bear the hunger. (National Telegraph on the 20th)</p>
<p>(London) General Franco, the leader of the Spanish National Army government, threatened that if the defending army did not surrender the city before midnight today, he would destroy the entire city because the National Army's attack on Madrid had been unsuccessful for a long time. The British and French authorities discussed this matter all day today and decided that the British government should instruct its ambassador to Spain, Sir Chilton, to negotiate with the National Army authorities again as soon as possible to ensure that the Spanish civil war, especially the Madrid war, is humane. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>Burgos: The National Army authorities recently notified the British government that the National Army government has decided to expand the original neutral zone in the northeast of Madrid and include the British and American embassies and the areas of several other national embassies. Within the neutral zone, the National Army will never bombard it. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<h3>Britain Continues to Be Neutral Towards Spain, Foreign Minister Eden's Speech: Unwilling to Add Fuel to the Fire</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Minister Eden stated in his speech in Leamington tonight that the British government is determined to adhere to the agreement not to interfere in the Spanish Civil War, and said that if there are firefighters today who add fuel to the fire to make it more turbulent, then the entire fire brigade has no reason to abandon its responsibilities and turn Europe into a furnace. The British government's decision is correct, so we are responsible for upholding it. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(London) Eden also mentioned general diplomatic policy, saying, "Britain opposes the creation of mutually hostile groups in the international arena. What we seek is to cooperate with all countries. Some people think that countries must adopt a corresponding political system before they can participate in the international system and cooperate. This kind of view can be said to be extremely absurd. It should be known that our country's army will never be used to participate in wars of aggression in the future, but if France and Belgium are invaded by other countries without provocation, the British army will naturally abide by its existing obligations and use them to defend the territory of France and Belgium if necessary. Also, if the security issue in Western Europe is resolved through the signing of a treaty, and Germany is invaded by one of the signatory countries without provocation, the British army can also be used to defend Germany."

<h3>Germany Denies Signing a Secret Military Pact with Japan; Germany Values Friendship with China; War Against Russia Would Be a Losing Proposition; Joint Anti-Red Defense Is Another Matter</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding recent news from Shanghai that the German Ambassador to Japan solemnly declared Germany's emphasis on friendship with China, and stated that no agreement had been established between Germany and Japan, the Hutung News Agency reporter learned from authoritative sources here that Germany has not signed any agreement with Japan. As for the rumored military agreement between Germany and Japan, it is also inaccurate. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>Mr. Fu Housi, the Eastern Manager of the German Hutung News Agency, has repeatedly seen reports in recent days about the conclusion of a secret military alliance between Japan and Germany. Even the specific content has been rumored in various and inconsistent ways. In reality, this matter is completely groundless and malicious slander, and a malicious propaganda to smear the friendship between China and Germany. I hereby responsibly deny it based on the facts and detail the origins as follows:</p>
<p>There are those who do not want the increasingly cordial and solid friendship between the revitalized China and the newly emerging Germany under the leadership of Mr. Hitler to progress smoothly. They often spread rumors and fabricate untruthful reports to alienate the Chinese people from their enthusiastic European friend, Germany.</p>
<p>In the past two years, we have read such news dozens of times. Recently, newspapers have also reported that Germany has concluded a military alliance with Japan, that Germany and Japan have signed an anti-Soviet agreement, and that Germany is exchanging munitions for Manchurian soybeans.</p>
<p>I believe that such stupid and upside-down methods are an insult to the intelligence of the Chinese people. The spreaders of these irresponsible rumors have not taken into account the Chinese newspaper readers' own ability to judge, and hope to use this stereotypical and repeatedly appearing false news to gradually erode the Chinese people's trust in their honest friends. However, these people will hardly get their wish, because the Chinese people have a very accurate understanding and can judge what is true and what is false. Germany has always regarded such slanders with a smile. We know deeply that the friendship between China and Germany will not be damaged by this, because true friends are made after self-consideration. External rumors will never cause mutual suspicion and hesitation. Human experience and factual experience are known to everyone, and there is no need to repeat them.</p>
<p>My motivation for refuting this time is like a private friendship. If you are suspected by a friend, you must tell your friend, "Others are trying to destroy the friendship between us, but you know me and I know you can trust me." Regarding the news reported in the newspapers, I now ask, "Does Germany have a military alliance with Japan?" The answer and the indication of the matter can only be answered with "No."</p>
<p>Japan and Germany are separated by vast oceans, with the vast Soviet Russia in between. Furthermore, if a war between Germany and Japan against Soviet Russia were to really occur, then the German people would be dealing with the largest number of troops in the world, handling nearly nine-tenths of it, while Japan would only handle slightly less than one-tenth. Moreover, the entire value of Soviet Russia is not even comparable to the blood shed by a single German soldier. Let us also look at the map of Europe and we can see how difficult it was for Germany to break free from the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles recently. Furthermore, we can learn two facts from this: (1) To this day, there are still anti-German groups in Europe. If Germany engages in war with Soviet Russia, then this group will definitely rise up and attack its rear, causing Germany to be attacked from both sides; (2) The policy of our leader and Prime Minister Hitler is very clear: "Germany is willing to live peacefully with the world."</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, some people now claim that based on information from this side or that side, a military alliance between Germany and Japan is indeed a reality. I ask, what contribution can Germany and Japan make in a military alliance? If the Germans want to attack Soviet Russia, they must pass through the countries between Germany and the Soviet Union, which is not permitted by any of Germany's eastern neighbors. The distance between Germany and the Soviet Union is no less than the shipping route between Shanghai and Gansu Province.</p>
<p>There is also no reason for Germany and Japan to conclude a military alliance in the Pacific Ocean. We deeply know that this alliance will place Germany and Japan's global policies in opposition to those of Britain. Do we have other interests in the Pacific Ocean that would prevent us from exercising military policy in the Far East? I will discuss this in another article later. I repeat again: "Germany and Japan will never conclude a military alliance. There is no hope or possibility for this alliance to exist in German national policy or Japanese policy."</p>
<p>Now, some people say that Germany and Japan have signed an anti-Soviet agreement. I answer, "An anti-Soviet agreement is no different from a military alliance between Germany and Japan against Moscow." The reasons have already been stated above and will not be repeated. However, joint defense actions to prevent the Third International's attempt at world revolution are very different from the former. We say with a sacred and serious attitude that the inherent civilization of a nation will be destroyed by communism. The events of the Russian Revolution are vivid in our minds and can serve as a warning.</p>
<p>Thanks to the power of our leader Hitler, central Europe has been liberated from the red danger. Look at Spain today, where thousands of innocent hostages are being brutally murdered under the guidance of Soviet Russia. From this, we can understand what the future holds for countries under the Third International.</p>
<p>Let's talk about China. I once traveled all over Jiangxi Province. Everywhere I looked, there were corpses lying in the fields, and the villages were desolate and desolate. It was unbearable to see. Why is this? This is all done by the Communist Party under the "hammer and sickle" banner. The loss of China's population is more than a million. The number of farmers who live and work in peace, workers who support themselves, and scholars who have been brutally poisoned is countless. The Communist Party's firm policy is to incite internal warfare in several parts of China, hinder the construction projects of the central government, and make it difficult for it to devote all its efforts to protecting the honor of the country. However, Moscow's sweet words have ultimately failed, and the Communist Party is still China's mortal enemy. I now recall Xinjiang. Has Soviet Russia not already revealed its intention in that province, aiming to separate the entire province from the territory of the motherland?</p>
<p>Furthermore, in Europe, when Hitler first took power in Germany in 1933, the enemies of the new Germany suddenly discovered their valuable friendship with Soviet Russia. Germany did not care and still followed its path towards national freedom. But to this day, the European nations are glaring at each other, and they realize that Soviet Russia will cause them to perish. As Soviet Russia and the countries become increasingly estranged, Germany will inevitably gradually take a leading position for the countries that recognize the red danger in Europe and the world. Germany's defensive line against Soviet Russia is not limited to Europe. Germany's position is well known to the Chinese authorities. Even to Japan, Germany has explained its views on the red danger in detail and clarified that opposing communism is the common principle of the world revolution philosophy. But other than that, we have never considered anything else or established any facts. Japan has expressed satisfaction with our efforts to keep the red flames away from its borders. We must also solemnly declare here that Germany has no hostility towards the Russian people. We hope that this great nation will one day be able to break free from the shackles of communism and return to peaceful coexistence with other nations.</p>
<p>In addition, what is more dangerous is the slander created by our enemies that Germany is exchanging munitions for Manchurian soybeans. I answer to this: this is a dream talk and a fantasy.</p>
<p>Manchuria has been the only part of China that has produced soybeans for decades. We used to be the biggest customers of Chinese soybeans. Consider that Germany is an industrial country, with a population of 70 million in an area only as large as a large province in China. Germany has a large number of urban residents, and Germany cannot fully supply the fat they need. Therefore, it has established an industry specializing in the manufacture of fats, most of which are made from soybeans. The unfortunate disputes in North China not only affect China itself, but also cause Germany, which relies on Manchurian soybeans, to suffer. Without soybeans, we would still not be able to support ourselves. Furthermore, due to foreign exchange relations, we have to exchange power plant machinery, engines, medicines, etc. for soybeans. Chinese farmers in Manchuria also gain a layer of protection in their lives due to Germany's export of soybeans. There is no large-scale planting of soybeans in other parts of China, so we cannot buy them elsewhere.</p>
<p>To say that Germany supplies Manchuria with armaments or gunpowder is even more false and absurd. There is no such thing. This proves that Germany's actions are actually opposed to China. Japan has a huge armaments and gunpowder industry, so it would be more reasonable to say that Japan is doing it.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, if Germany and Japan had a so-called alliance or agreement, then Germany would have recognized Manchuria. The facts are there, and Germany has never recognized "Manchukuo."</p>
<p>In terms of reasoning, Germany is developing a huge market in China, and it would never rashly take this rebellious action to cut off its future before it is fully achieved.</p>
<p>China's happiness can make Germany happy as well, because China's rising purchasing power can allow German workers to have jobs and wages, and Germany can also purchase its products from China. This is also what Chinese farmers and workers depend on for food and clothing. Germany's major industries need Chinese raw materials, and China's industries also need German machinery. Why would Germany want to destroy this friendship that concerns the lives of the Chinese people? Pacific peace is Germany's only policy here. We need peace to run our business, and we need business to survive. Since we need peace and business, we will never participate in any events that endanger our future and business. It goes without saying that China and Germany still have a long and difficult period of revitalization. I sincerely hope that the two nations can work together with all their strength, based on their past history and true friendship. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Japan Prepares to Conclude Cultural Agreement with Germany; Preventing the Threat of the Third International; Signing at the End of This Month or the Beginning of Next Month</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the news from Berlin that Japan and Germany are about to conclude a cultural agreement, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs authorities admitted today that Japan is preparing to sign the agreement, but stated that it is not limited to Germany, and will also sign the agreement with other countries. Regarding this point, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement saying that current diplomacy should not be limited to political and trade issues, and cultural cooperation is also needed. Japan now not only wants to conclude a cultural agreement with a specific country, but also wants to sign it with other countries. So far, the countries that have signed cultural agreements are Germany, Austria, Spain, and Argentina. The main terms are the exchange of scholars, students, and artists. It seems that Japan will sign this agreement, but it is not limited to Germany. The above statement is quite noteworthy, because a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs publicly stated on the morning of the 21st that Japan, in view of the international organization of the Third International, will now organize a common front with other major powers that feel the same threat from the Third International. This morning, the spokesman reiterated this statement, and it is said that the cultural agreement between Japan and Germany in this spirit may be officially signed in Berlin at the end of November or the beginning of December.

<h3>Regarding the Japan-Germany Agreement; Russia Dissatisfied with Japan's Explanation; Why Do We Need Other Countries to Suppress Communism in Our Country?</h3>
<p>(Moscow) TASS learned from reliable sources that Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev visited Japanese Foreign Minister Arita on November 19 and notified him that the Soviet government considered Arita's explanation of the nature of the Japan-Germany agreement to Mr. Yurenev on the 16th of this month to be unsatisfactory. Mr. Yurenev stated that the Soviet government's opinion was that the German government needed the assistance of the Japanese police, and the Japanese government also needed the assistance of the German police, to suppress communism in their respective countries, and that it was necessary to conclude an international agreement to implement this. This reason is really hard to believe. Mr. Yurenev also said that this anti-communist agreement is nothing more than another mask for a Japan-Germany agreement, and that the agreement will not be announced, and its purpose is to jointly deal with third countries. Therefore, Mr. Yurenev said that he has been authorized to declare that this agreement will seriously harm Soviet-Japanese relations. Arita equivocated to this statement and did not reply.

<h3>Approximately 80,000 Yuan for Maintaining Security on the Korean Border</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government has decided to spend 79,990 yuan from the surplus of the special account of the Korean Governor-General's Office to maintain security in the vicinity of the Korean border, as the suppression of bandits and rebels in "Manchukuo" has progressed day by day. The imperial decree was issued and announced in the official gazette on the 21st. (Domei Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Writer Yoneda Opposes the Alliance, Saying It Is Unfavorable to Japan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The news of the Japan-Germany alliance, which has caused extreme shock in all aspects of the world, has been denied by both Japan and Germany, but the news that a Japan-Germany cultural agreement is about to be signed has also been revealed. People here generally have doubts about whether the agreement is indeed limited to the cultural sphere. The newspapers have not mentioned a word about the cultural agreement, which makes the doubts even deeper. What is noteworthy is that the famous international affairs critic Yoneda Jitsuzai published an article in the December issue of "Japan Review," putting forward three reasons for opposing the conclusion of an alliance between Japan and Germany, briefly stating: (1) Although anti-communism is a common goal of Japan and Germany, the distance between the two countries is too far, and the actual interests of the two countries are very different. Japan should not interfere in European affairs. If it is involved in the vortex of European affairs due to the relationship of the alliance, it is not worth it. (2) Germany's goal is Ukraine. If Japan concludes an alliance with Germany, then if a war occurs in that area, Japan will need to participate, but this is absolutely unprofitable for Japan. (3) Since the conflict between Germany and the Soviet Union is inevitable, Germany will definitely join if a war occurs between Japan and the Soviet Union. Therefore, Japan does not need to conclude an alliance with Germany. Although Mr. Yoneda believes that there is no need to conclude an alliance to bind Japan to participate in the war, he does not oppose cooperation with Germany. That is, if it is necessary to consult each other on specific issues, it is okay to seek mutual understanding. From the above article, it can be seen that the discussion of the Japan-Germany alliance has recently become more important, and it has a tendency to constitute Japanese foreign policy.

<h3>Japan Establishes Manchuria Industrial Bank to Control Finance in the Puppet State; Capital of 30 Million Yuan; Tomita Appointed as President</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Office of Manchurian Affairs announced that, in order to improve the financial institutions of "Manchukuo," the Japanese and Manchu governments have decided to establish the Manchuria Industrial Bank. After negotiations to purchase all the business of the Korean Bank (excluding those in the Kwantung Leased Territory) and the Manchuria Bank and Zhenglong Bank in Manchuria, all parties have understood the importance of national policy, and the cooperation has been successfully resolved. It can be realized within days. The Manchuria Industrial Bank is a special bank of "Manchukuo" with a capital of 30 million yuan in national currency, half of which will be paid in first (half by the "Manchukuo" government and half by the Korean Bank). In addition to general banking business, it also operates long-term financial business to smooth general finance. At the same time, for the purpose of developing various industries, its mission is to provide the necessary long-term, low-interest funds. And for the purpose of obtaining funds, it has the special right to issue bonds fifteen times its paid-up capital. If bonds are issued abroad, the "Manchukuo" government guarantees the payment of principal and interest to the Central Bank of Manchuria. Its mission is naturally different. We deeply expect the two banks to gradually adjust and cooperate with each other in their respective business fields, and each to fulfill their mission without regret. Although the Korean Bank has always shouldered an important task in Japan's policy toward Manchuria, this time, except for the Kwantung Leased Territory, all branches in Manchuria have been sold to the Industrial Bank. Therefore, in the future, it can be a sister bank, maintaining coordination and seeking common development. However, the convertible notes of the Korean Bank will naturally no longer be issued in "Manchukuo." This bank will be established roughly in early December, taking over the business of the Korean, Manchuria, and Zhenglong Banks, and is scheduled to open in early January next year. (Domei Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The executives of the Manchuria Industrial Bank are as follows: President Tomita Yūtarō (Overseas Financial Officer of the Ministry of Finance), Vice President Matsubara Junichi (Vice President of the Korean Bank), Directors Matsuda Yoshio (Director of the Korean Bank), Isshiki Shinichi (Head of the Survey Division of the Industrial Bank) (Domei Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Disaster in Japanese Mine; Huge Losses; Totaling Tens of Millions of Yuan</h3>

The planes carrying Chairman Chiang's entourage also landed shortly after. As the two planes landed, Chairman Chiang and his party disembarked amidst the sound of military music. Deputy Chairman Yan stepped forward to greet him, shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries in a very cordial manner. Chairman Chiang also nodded frequently to Chairman Zhao and the welcoming personnel. He then rode into the city with Deputy Chairman Yan in a car. At this time, the welcoming personnel also returned to the city by car. When Chairman Chiang reached Xiaobeimen, male and female students from various schools and civil servants from various organizations saluted him. Chiang raised his hand in response. After entering the city, he stayed at the Xingyuan on Xinmin Zhongzheng Street. At 3 PM, another part of Chairman Chiang's entourage arrived in Taiyuan by plane.</p>

<h3>Student Movement in Beiping Supports Suiyuan; Donates Salaries, Fasts, Raises Funds to Comfort the Troops; But Some Parties Express Dissatisfaction</h3>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: It has been a week since the eastern part of Suiyuan was invaded by the pseudo-bandit army. Our soldiers are bravely defending the territory in the icy and snowy weather, with their positions as solid as mountains, which is truly admirable. Teachers and students from various schools in Beiping have successively donated salaries, fasted, raised funds, and sent telegrams to express their condolences and support. Details of the situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>At 4 PM on the 17th, the President of Peking University, Xu Songming, convened a discussion meeting of the administrative committee in the office. Xu Songming and deans Xu Shoutang, Zhang Yihui, Bai Pengfei, etc., attended. As a result of the discussion, considering the urgent situation in Guisui and the soldiers risking their lives, it was decided that all faculty and staff of the school would donate one day's salary, which is expected to amount to more than 2,500 yuan, to be remitted to the front lines for consolation. After seeking the consent of all faculty and staff, fundraising will continue. After the discussion meeting, the school sent a telegram to Chairman of Suiyuan, Fu Zuoyi, stating, "The invasion of Guisui is urgent, and Your Excellency's command is decisive. The whole country relies on you as a Great Wall. However, in this icy and snowy weather, the soldiers on the front lines are doing their best for the country. Our school colleagues have preemptively contributed one day's income to the front lines to express our condolences and support. The funds will be remitted separately. We send this telegram first." The students of the school also plan to organize a joint support association for Suiyuan soldiers from the five schools. After each school has organized separately, they will form a joint association. The Franco-Chinese University Support Association has been established and conducted large-scale street donations on the 18th.</p>
<p>From the 18th, students of Northeastern University reduced their breakfast portions and stopped heating for a week to save funds for the army. The students of the affiliated Beiping school of the university also launched a fundraising campaign and planned to unite with elementary schools in the city to organize a fundraising association for elementary school students to support Suiyuan. The Autonomous Association was established on the 17th and is responsible for handling everything.</p>
<p>In addition to saving on heating, teachers and students of Yenching University fasted for a day on the 17th. At noon, they swore an oath in the Great Auditorium to express their determination to support the Suiyuan soldiers. From the 18th, they suspended classes for three days and formed teams to walk into the city to expand fundraising.</p>
<p>The Fundraising Preparatory Committee for Aiding Suiyuan Soldiers, organized by teachers, students, and staff of major primary and secondary schools in Beiping, held a press conference at Linhuxuan in Yenching University at 3 PM on the 18th to report on the work plan. It is divided into four phases: the first phase is the 10,000-piece leather clothing movement, the second phase is the steel helmet movement, the third phase is the gas mask movement, and the fourth phase is the organization of a rescue team movement. It was also decided to expand fundraising, and the 19th to the 26th was designated as Fundraising Week. All members of the Fundraising Preparatory Committee and students of member schools will skip lunch to save money for aid and express their patriotic determination. At the same time, Yenching University, Beijing Normal University, and the Franco-Chinese University formed fundraising teams. Starting at 10 AM on the 18th, they went to various businesses and pedestrians in Beiping to solicit donations. There were about 200 people in 30 teams from Yenching University, including a women's team. There were 300 people in 30 teams from Northeastern University, with three, five, seven, or eight people in each team. The students who solicited donations all held small flags with white cloth and black characters and receipts. Their attitude was very amiable. Several hundred yuan have been raised on the 18th. A patriotic atmosphere has filled the ancient city. Mei Yibao, a professor at Yenching University, accompanied a student to Suiyuan by car on the evening of the 18th to inspect and comfort the soldiers.</p>
<p>Some parties were quite dissatisfied with the current aid-Suiyuan movement from various circles and have expressed informal opinions. The Beiping authorities believe that the actions of the students in this movement are all based on patriotic sincerity. However, on the 18th, some people claimed to be students from a certain school and solicited donations in the main streets of the city. After discussions, it was believed that the actions of the students had the following disadvantages: (1) It is impossible to distinguish whether those who are soliciting donations in the main streets are truly students. (2) Casual fundraising cannot be investigated. (3) Sudden stops of traffic in the main streets easily affect traffic order. (4) Inevitably, bad elements will infiltrate, distribute leaflets, and confuse the public. (5) Other incidents are most likely to occur. Based on the above reasons, this movement was stopped. The Beiping Municipal Government specifically invited the presidents of various universities, including Jiang Menglin, Xu Songming, Mei Yiqi, Lu Zhiwei, and Li Zheng, to a banquet at the Xihuatang of the Municipal Government at 6 PM on the evening of the 19th. However, due to Mayor Qin Dechun's presence in Bao to witness Feng Zhi'an's inauguration, he was unable to return to Beiping. Secretary-General Zhou Luan, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Lei Sishang, and Director of the Public Security Bureau Chen Jiyan represented him. Song Zheyuan, fearing incidents in Beiping, also met with Han Fuqu in Nangong at 9 PM on the evening of the 18th before rushing back to Beiping to take charge of everything.</p>
<h3>Amidst Anhui Province's Prohibition of Rice Exports, Large Numbers of Ships are Detained Mid-Journey; Rice Merchant Representatives Telegraph the Provincial Government to Thoroughly Investigate and Release Them</h3>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: Anhui Province had a bumper rice harvest this year, which is rare in recent years. Merchants from various places came to Wuhu to purchase rice continuously, and various industries also had a thriving outlook. However, although the amount of exports was far less than in previous years, rice prices, like other ports, rose rapidly, reaching more than nine yuan per stone, causing panic over people's food and high prices for all goods. However, after carefully examining the production and sales ratio, there is no doubt that there is a large surplus of rice. It goes without saying that this abnormal phenomenon is caused by someone manipulating hoarding for profit and other major reasons. After this autumn drought, the spring famine is approaching again. The Anhui Provincial Government, after repeated consideration, decided to issue an order prohibiting the export of rice from the province in case of emergencies. After this ban was announced, rice merchants from various parts of southern Anhui gathered in Wuhu and telegraphed various parties requesting the ban be lifted, as there was no concern that the province's food supply would be lacking. The provincial government also attached great importance to this matter and was carefully considering it. Unexpectedly, numerous rice ships carrying rice mid-journey were detained in Yuxikou, Xiliangshan, and Jinhekou in Hexian County due to the limited time for the implementation of the provincial order, which was difficult to fully communicate. Even wheat flour was obstructed mid-journey. The Wuhu flour company requested the Wuhu Chamber of Commerce to forward a request for release. Representatives of sailing rice merchants and rice milling shops throughout the province recently gathered in Wuhu for a meeting, stating that not only did Hexian County detain rice ships, but they also forcibly unloaded the rice onto land and detained hundreds of boatmen. The damage caused by this is immeasurable, and the public sentiment is extremely indignant. It was decided to telegraph the Anhui Provincial Government to send personnel to investigate and handle the matter, order the return of the original goods, and release the people and ships. The original telegram is as follows: "To Liu Jun, Chairman of the Anqing Provincial Government: In accordance with the provincial order prohibiting the export of rice, all counties should strictly comply with it. However, the provincial order has been implemented for only a few days, and the merchants' ships en route may not be fully informed. The handling should be differentiated. Recently, it was found that the Hexian County Government dispatched teams to gather ships anchored at various ports waiting for prices to Jinhekou in the county and forcibly coerced them. Those who complied would be allowed to pass, while those who opposed would be forcibly unloaded, mixing coarse and refined rice in one pile, and beans and wheat were not spared. There was no distinction between them, and they were splashed and scattered regardless. Over a hundred ships have been unloaded and over a hundred people have been detained. This kind of haste undoubtedly exceeds the original intention of the provincial order prohibiting exports. Moreover, all the merchant ships are still within the territory of the province. We do not know what the county government is thinking. Even if there is a slight suspicion of export, before the ban was issued, it would have been appropriate to order them to return. This would have been appropriate in terms of reason and emotion. In desperation, we earnestly request that you send personnel to investigate and handle the matter, and order the county government to be responsible for returning the goods and releasing the people and ships in order to reassure the business community. This would be in the public interest. Yuan Doushu, representative of the Anhui Provincial Sailing Office in Wuhu, Wu Wentang, representative of the rice industry, Gu Houfu, representative of the rice milling industry, and others bow.

<h3>Land in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province Will Begin to Implement Land Value Tax; Can be Implemented After Land Registration is Completed; Field Tax Will be Abolished After Land Tax is Collected</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that although land tax has been reformed repeatedly, it still follows the names of diagrams and silver rice, which are troublesome to calculate and unclear to the people. The procedures for handling are numerous, and malpractices occur from time to time. Although the provincial government has considered reform, it has been difficult to implement, so it has not been changed in the past twenty-five years. Last year, the Land Bureau was established to carry out land surveys, and this year, land registration began, which is being actively carried out. It is learned that the provincial government will implement land value tax after the completion of land registration, and the date of commencement will be the time when the collection of the previous field tax is abolished. The rules for collecting land value tax were previously drafted by the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department and submitted to the provincial government for revision. There are thirteen articles, which will be distributed to various counties for compliance in the near future. The original text is as follows:</p>

<h3>Suzhou Propaganda for Supporting the Suiyuan Movement</h3>
<p>Various circles in Suzhou are very enthusiastic about the Suiyuan Movement. Suzhou Mingbao and other newspapers collect donations on behalf of others, and the amount is quite large. Public servants of various institutions are also in the process of saving money for fundraising. The Propaganda Section of the County Assistance Association for the Garrisoning Corps specially convened a meeting of representatives of various high schools and above in the county at 1 PM on the 21st. It was decided at that time that students from various schools would organize more than 200 propaganda teams, with five people in each team, to go to various places in the city to promote the movement to the public in order to awaken the public. After the meeting, each team immediately set out to promote the movement.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Provincial Department Inspects the Wuqing Road</h3>
<p>The Wujin to Qingyang Highway has been completed earlier. Long-distance buses were originally scheduled to start operating on the 15th of this month, but the opening was postponed because the road surface engineering had not yet been inspected and accepted by the provincial department. On the 20th, Zhu Ming, an inspector sent by the provincial government, and Shen Baozhang, a secretary sent by the Construction Department, arrived in Changzhou from Zhenjiang, together with Shen Xue, the engineering director, and Li Jiayi, the chief of the second section of the county government. At about 1 PM, they took a small car to inspect and accept bridges, culverts, and road surface engineering along the way. By about 4 PM, the entire road had been inspected. The Wuqing Automobile Company believes that since the road surface engineering has been completed and accepted and all preparations have been completed, it has decided to open the Wujin to Henglin section on the 25th, with a one-way fare of 22 cents.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Postal Bureau Private Soil Case Released on Bail</h3>
<p>Gu Fuqi, a clerk in the parcel room of the local postal bureau, committed suicide at home by electrocution. His suicide note involved the issue of private soil, implicating ten people, including Tong Jiayao and Yang Dahui. After the conclusion of the interrogation by the Second District Security Command, it was determined that they were not related to the case and were allowed to be released on bail on the 19th of this month and regained their freedom. Shen Fengzheng, the director of the postal bureau, reported the situation to the Postal Administration, requesting instructions on reinstatement, as Tong and others were implicated for no reason. Tong and others also requested Director Shen to apply to the Administration for the allocation of their suspended salaries to maintain their livelihoods.</p>
<h3>Price of Fine Yarn Rises</h3>
<p>Recently, the market price of cotton yarn has become active again and has been rising daily. However, it is not as fierce as the surge last month. Affected by the Shanghai market, the local market price of cotton yarn has risen by one yuan. Actual sales are not very brisk. The sale of existing yarn from various factories is also not very active. Therefore, the market situation is not tense, and people's hearts are very firm. Also, the flour market situation is that raw materials are gradually becoming scarce, and prices are rising. Yesterday's opening price for Jiufeng and Shanlu brands was 3 yuan and 75 cents per bag. Most of the purchases are from Shaanxi and other places coming to Wuxi to purchase. The local sales are very slow.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou County Districts Donate Salaries to Help Pay Military Expenses</h3>
<p>Magistrate of Jiangdu County Ma Zhenbang, considering the serious situation in eastern Suiyuan, led all staff and police officers of the county government to donate one day's salary and remit it to the front lines for consolation. On the 20th, he ordered the district chiefs to comply and ordered them to submit the name list of all staff and police officers in their respective districts together with the donations to the county for forwarding.</p>
<h3>Nantong Police Officer Commits Suicide by Shooting</h3>
<p>Zhang Yuankai, a first-class police officer from the Public Security Bureau's Nanxin Market Police Station in Tongcheng, returned to the station after patrolling at 4 AM on the 20th and suddenly committed suicide by shooting himself to death. After examination by the court prosecutor, his body was claimed by his family for burial.</p>
<h3>Thorough Investigation of Embezzled Stolen Money</h3>
<p>The Fourth District Security Command believes that the amount of stolen money recovered in the case of the 15,000 yuan robbery of cotton in Xilan is short. The detective captain of the Nantong County Public Security Bureau, Yao Dangping, detective Yang Weiting, and patrol leader Zhao Yugui, were detained and sent to the court for thorough investigation. On the 20th, Prosecutor Liu interrogated them and confronted them with the bandit Ji Youfu, who was captured in the case. Yao and others were still held in the detention center.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Four Highways Completely Repaired</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Construction Department believes that the Tongjian, Jianjie, Jianlan, and Chunsui highways are important transportation routes between Zhejiang and Anhui provinces. Previously, due to the disturbance of bandits and the unrest in the local area, travelers were restricted. Now, as a result of the army's vigorous suppression, the bandit atmosphere has gradually been cleared. Old and broken vehicles have been recalled, and new-style passenger cars have been allocated to operate on these roads. All four routes can be reached directly without obstruction. Situations such as breakdowns in the middle have no longer occurred. Passengers in both provinces have praised the convenience, so the income from the transportation of goods has increased sharply.</p>
<h3>Letter Received</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I recently read the Wuxi dispatch in the news section of your newspaper on November 18, with the title "Silk Factory Buys Children to Sacrifice to Chimneys." It stated that near Xintangqiao Township in Dongting Town, Second District, a local silk merchant, Bao, etc., raised funds to initiate the construction of a small silk factory with 120 silk machines. All the houses are about to be completed. However, Bao, etc., were misled by superstition and needed to hold a grand sacrifice to the chimney after the factory was completed. They had previously purchased a child from a certain family, raised him in the factory, provided him with meat every day, and prepared him to be sacrificed to the chimney. This inhumane act is deeply hoped to be stopped by the authorities, etc. Hearing this, I was shocked. This kind of groundless fabrication not only damages personal reputation but also makes people commit criminal offenses. In addition to submitting a request to the Wuxi County Government Public Security Bureau and the Wuxi Court to investigate according to law, I am afraid that false information will be spread. Therefore, I specially send a letter to request a correction. Sincerely, To the Chief Editor of Shenbao Newspaper, Qiju Silk Factory, Dongting, Wuxi.</p>

<h3>Shanghai County Government Proclamation: Land Price Tax Collection, Hoping that the Public Will Actively Pay</h3>
<p>The land price tax of Shanghai County was officially collected the day before yesterday (the 20th). In addition to issuing a proclamation, the Shanghai County Government also convened the district chiefs of each district to give instructions, urging them to instruct the township chiefs to notify each business owner to pay on time. The original text of the proclamation is recorded as follows: It is hereby announced that the field tax of this county has been ordered to be changed to the land price tax this year. During the tenure of the previous County Magistrate Ye, preparations were started. At the beginning of the tenure of this County Magistrate, successive reports were received from local associations and local people, with many suggestions regarding the estimated land price and the tax rate set in this county. It was considered that the implementation of this new policy was a major event concerning the land policy formulated by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. If it is not handled carefully from the beginning, it will be difficult to achieve complete benefits. The local association suggested that, on the premise of not hindering the provincial and county budgets and not increasing the burden on farmers, land price tax for the first period should be collected while representatives (ten people) should be recommended to properly evaluate the land price and tax rate in the city, so that the tax payments can be corrected during the second period of collection, so as to facilitate both officials and the people. The report was considered feasible and was approved. In addition, a sample of the land price tax license was drafted and submitted for approval. Now, Instruction No. 30419 from the Department of Finance has been received, which modifies and issues the sample of the land price tax license, and stipulates the collection period, land price tax rate, and self-sealing of bids and submission to the counter, penalties for late payments, etc., ordering immediate compliance and reporting. Compliance is required, and it is now decided to start collecting the first period of land price tax for this year on November 20th of this year. In addition to the notification and the report, this proclamation is hereby issued to all business owners in this county to comply with it in its entirety. Please pay the amount of silver due as stated on the notification form to the counter within the specified time limit and obtain a license to secure your property. It should be noted that the starting date for the collection of this year's new policy of field tax is later than the established precedents and the stipulated time limit, which is already considered too late. Now is the time when the autumn harvest is abundant and the financial situation is ample. You must seize this opportunity to comply with the requirements and actively pay the tax. Those who still fail to pay at the counter will be summoned and pursued, and a fine of 5% per annum will be levied in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 8 of Part 4 of the Land Law. Do not wait and see and make mistakes, which may lead to penalties. This is a warning.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Regulates Food Prices and Stabilizes Grain Prices, Organizes Grain Transit Registration, and All Transit to Other Ports Must Be Transported with a Registration Certificate, and the Two Railway Bureaus and Customs Have Been Ordered to Comply and Assist</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Social Affairs Bureau to the Shanghai Municipal Government, in order to regulate food prices and stabilize grain prices, the government has specially organized grain transit registration and transferred it to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Railways to order the Customs and Railway Bureau to comply and assist. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Document from the Social Affairs Bureau to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau reported to the Municipal Government that, in order to regulate food prices and stabilize grain prices, it is first necessary to understand the status of surplus and deficiency and to handle it with accuracy. The investigation of rice and grain sales in this city has been carried out by this bureau for many years. However, the quantity of transit grain is only compiled statistically based on the customs reports on a monthly basis. In the period of stable market prices, it is sufficient for reference. However, once a food crisis occurs, it is impossible to understand the true situation, and it is difficult to control it temporarily. For example, the recent soaring prices of rice, wheat, and flour in this city were caused by many factors. However, according to the investigation, the impact of a large amount of transit is not insignificant. After weighing the market situation and consulting with seed merchants, this bureau believes that if the quantity of rice, wheat, flour, and beans in transit in this city is not checked at ordinary times, it will not be easy to adjust it temporarily. In order to prevent and maintain it in advance, organizing transit registration is an effective method. However, the matter must be assisted by the Customs and the Railway Bureau before it can be implemented. Therefore, the "Shanghai Rice, Wheat, Flour, and Beans Transit Registration Measures" and the application form, certificate, and registration certificate are prepared and submitted to you for review. Please consult the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Railways to transfer them to the Customs and the Railway Bureau to comply and assist, and send a copy to the Ministry of Interior for verification. It is really a public service.</p>
<p>Grain Transit Registration Measures</p>
<p>Shanghai Rice, Wheat, Flour, and Beans Transit Registration Measures: (1) Anyone who purchases rice, wheat, flour, and beans in this city for transit to other ports must apply for registration at the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and hold a registration certificate before they can be transported. (2) The application form in the preceding paragraph shall be prepared and issued by the Social Affairs Bureau. All transit merchants or merchants may directly request it from the Food Section of the Fourth Division of the Bureau. (3) The application form must state the following: 1. Name, place of origin, occupation, and address of the applicant; 2. Goods and grades; 3. Place of origin, price, and quantity; 4. Name of the selling merchant and name of the manager; 5. Date of loading and name of the ship or train number; 6. Delivery address; 7. Name of the receiving merchant and name of the manager. It must also be certified by the relevant grain industry association in this city. The grain industry association mentioned in the preceding paragraph refers to the Bean Rice Industry Association, the Rice Number Industry Association, the Rice Milling Industry Association, and the Rice Grain Industry Association for Resale for rice; the Miscellaneous Grain Oilcake Industry Association for wheat; the Flour Mill Industry Association for flour; the Bean Rice Industry Association, the Miscellaneous Grain Oilcake Industry Association, and the Miscellaneous Grain Retail Industry Association for beans. (4) After receiving the application form and certificate from the applicant, if the Social Affairs Bureau considers the report to be true, it shall immediately issue a transit registration certificate. 5. The application certificate paper and transit registration certificate in the preceding paragraph shall be issued by the Social Affairs Bureau without any fees. 6. In case of food shortage in this city, the Social Affairs Bureau may temporarily suspend transit registration or reduce the quantity of transit. 7. Rice, wheat, flour, and beans that have not been approved for registration shall absolutely not be allowed to be transported. 8. These measures shall be implemented from the date of approval by the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Customs and Railway Bureau Ordered to Comply</p>
<p>The Municipal Government has transferred it to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Railways to transfer it to the Customs and the Railway Bureau to comply and assist. Now, the Jianghai Customs and the Two Railway Bureaus have received the order from the Ministry. The order No. 4263 from the Ministry of Railways is recorded as follows: "Approved Shanghai Municipal Government's Consultation No. 5573 of October 31 of this year, which opened, 'According to the report of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, (omitted in the middle) etc., attached are the registration measures and other documents. According to this, the proposed Shanghai Rice, Wheat, Flour, and Beans Transit Registration Measures are for the purpose of regulating food prices and preventing smuggling abroad, which is a necessary plan. In addition to submitting it to the Executive Yuan for review and consultation, the registration measures are hereby copied and sent to you. It is hoped that you will take note of this and quickly transfer it to the Railway Bureau for assistance and reply. ' etc. Approval is hereby granted, and assistance should be provided. Hereafter, if any stations in Shanghai report the transportation of rice, wheat, flour, and beans for transit to other ports, it shall be limited to those holding a registration certificate from the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, otherwise, the railway shall refuse to load it to assist. In addition to replying, the registration measures are copied and issued for your compliance. '"</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Speaks Freely About His Feelings on the Trip South, Praising the Organization of Guangxi Province, But the Financial System Still Needs to Be Sorted Out, Guangdong Province Has Made Progress in All Aspects, and Society Is More Stable Than Before</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Sun Ke, the Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, was dispatched by the Central Government on the 21st of last month, accompanied by Legislative Yuan members Li Wenfan, Liang Hancao, Fu Bingchang, Xie Baoqiao, and others, to go south to attend the state funeral of the late Chairman Hu. After that, they went to Guangxi, Hunan, and other places to visit scenic spots. They returned to Nanjing tired of traveling at noon on the 20th. On the same day, they took a plane to this city from Nanjing with Deng Gang, the director of the Guangdong Pacification Commissioner's Office in Nanjing. At 10:00 AM on the 21st, they met with newspaper reporters at their private residence on Columbia Road to talk freely about their trip south.</p>
<p>Bai Will Go North</p>
<p>According to Sun, after attending Mr. Hu's state funeral, he took a detour to Guangxi, Hunan, and other provinces to travel. He stayed in Guilin for four days and visited Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and others. The date of Bai's entry into Nanjing has not yet been decided. After the major demobilization affairs in Guangxi Province are completely completed, he can go north. In short, Bai's entry into Nanjing is only a matter of time. The number of people mobilized in Guangxi Province this time has reached more than 300,000, so it takes a lot of time to handle the demobilization.</p>
<p>Characteristics of Guangxi Province</p>
<p>Sun expressed his appreciation for the local organization in Guangxi Province and said that it can be called a model province in China and can be used as a reference for the whole country. The most obvious characteristic of the organization is the militia. The militia organization consists of ten households as one Jia and one hundred and sixty households as one village. Above the village is the township, and above the township is the county. The whole province has telephone access in all directions. The provincial government can notify all counties, townships, and villages in the province by telephone within two hours. Education in the whole province has also made progress. Each village has at least one elementary school. The principal is concurrently the village chief. At the same time, the village chief is also the commander of the militia. There are a total of more than 20,000 villages in the whole province. As for the financial system of Guangxi Province, the currency in circulation on the market is still the Guangxi currency. Compared with the legal tender, a premium must be added, ranging from 5% to 7%. Therefore, the financial system still needs to be sorted out.</p>
<p>Progress in Guangdong Affairs</p>
<p>Sun continued to say that since the establishment of the Guangdong government, the province's military, civil administration, finance, etc. have made obvious progress compared with the past. As for the social situation in Guangdong Province, it is also more stable than before. Although prices are higher than before, the export of goods is increasing day by day. In short, hundreds of undertakings in Guangdong Province are making efforts to promote them, and I think there will be obvious progress again soon.</p>
<p>Suiyuan Incident</p>
<p>Sun believes that the banditry in Suiyuan will eventually be eliminated in the short term. Regarding the German-Japanese alliance, which is widely rumored in the market, Sun only said that the theory of the German-Japanese alliance cannot be determined to be impossible at present. Once it becomes a reality as rumored, it is dared to predict that the relationship between Britain, France, and the United States will become more and more close.</p>

<p>Xihua Resumed Work Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>After the joint strike of all the workers of the Xihua First, Second, and Third Factories on Laobeisheng Road on the evening of the 19th, the representatives of the workers (18 people) went to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau in the morning of the 20th to petition, requesting a quick relief. At 4:00 PM, the factory informed the workers through the heads of various departments and classes that the factory would agree to increase wages in the same way as other factories, hoping that the workers would work with peace of mind. Therefore, most of the workers agreed, and 70% to 80% of the workers who worked day and night have entered the factory to work. It is expected that all the workers will enter the factory to work this morning.</p>
<p>Toyota Will Start Work on Monday</p>
<p>Five days have passed since the general strike of the workers of the Toyota First and Second Factories on Zhongshan Road Bridge. After the chairman of the local association of this city, Du Yuesheng, and the director of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association, Qian Xinzhi, visited Ritsuichiro Funatsu, the chairman of the Japanese Textile Industry Association in China, and jointly invited the labor and management to mediate, the factory expressed its acceptance of the workers' demands, and the workers also made concessions on some of the terms. All the workers are scheduled to resume work tomorrow morning. The various items destroyed in the second factory have already been sorted out and are being prepared to start work next Monday. However, the Japanese Marine Corps soldiers and armored vehicles stationed inside and outside the factory have not been withdrawn, and Chinese patrol police are also stationed along the road outside the factory.</p>
<p>General Situation of Each Factory</p>
<p>All the workers of the Interior and Exterior Cotton First Factory on Xiaoshadu Laobeisheng Road are still on strike. Only more than 200 people in the weaving department of the Second Factory are working. Less than 40% of the workers in the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Third Factories on West Suzhou Road are working. All the workers in the Eighth Factory on Gordon Road are on strike. It is estimated that 60% to 70% of the workers in the Ninth Factory on Maigen Road have entered the factory. Because the workers of each factory have not fully resumed work, it is difficult to work, and work is sometimes suspended, and the production rate has been greatly reduced. In addition, the factory of the Japanese-owned Rihua Yarn Factory in Caojiadu on Laobeisheng Road is scheduled to pay the wages for the previous period yesterday. However, because it is rumored outside that the workers will also join the strike after the factory pays the wages, the factory specially requested the headquarters of the Japanese Marine Corps to send more than 30 armed Marine Corps soldiers to stay in the factory for precautionary purposes. Outside the factory, an armored gun vehicle No. 26 was also parked, and Tan Baoshou, the director of the Caojiadu Branch of the Public Security Bureau, also personally led more than 20 police officers to be stationed inside and outside the factory to protect it. There has been no labor dispute. As for other factories such as the Tongxing First and the Gongda Third Factories, they are all working as usual.</p>
<p>Workers' Meetings at Various Factories</p>
<p>More than 300 workers from the striking yarn factories in the Husi District intended to hold a meeting of representatives from various factories in the Pingmin New Village on Zhongshan Road at about 10:00 AM yesterday. After hearing the news, the Xinzao Branch of the district immediately sent police to suppress and disperse them. Then the workers of each factory gathered again in an empty house in a remote area of Danzi Bay to hold a meeting. The Caojiadu Branch also tried to persuade them to disperse, and no incident occurred.</p>
<p>Hudong Pudong is Quiet</p>
<p>In addition to the fact that most of the workers of the Shanghai Second and Third Factories at the Guangxin Wharf in Yangshupu, Hudong, have resumed work, the labor disputes in various factories such as the Tongxing Second, Dakang, Gongda Second, Yufeng One, Two, and Donghua have been eliminated. All the workers of the Rihua Yarn Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, are working as usual, and the situation is extremely peaceful.</p>

<h3>Wan Province Hexian Detains Rice; Grain Traders Urge Release; Jiashang and Other Counties in Zhejiang Province Continue to Obstruct Grain Transport; Petition to the Ministry of Railways for Swift Allocation of Grain Transport Vehicles</h3>
<p>Regarding the procedures for Shanghai grain merchants purchasing rice and grain from Zhejiang province, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce issues certificates for passage. However, Jiashang and other counties are still obstructing the process, causing inconvenience to transportation. Simultaneously, Hexian in Anhui province has also detained over a hundred rice boats. The Shanghai Grain and Oilcake Traders Association, to maintain the food supply for Shanghai citizens, has again requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to telegraph both Zhejiang and Anhui provinces for facilitation, and has petitioned the Ministry of Railways for a swift allocation of grain transport vehicles for regulation. The details of each situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter to the Chamber of Commerce I</p>
<p>Respected Sirs, the circulation of domestic rice and grains has long been implemented by order of the Central Government. We have received reports from our colleagues at Xie Changde and others that rice and grains purchased from Anhui province and transported to Hexian were suddenly seized, and the people detained. Other rice boats, more than a hundred in total, were also detained simultaneously, and falsely reported to the provincial government as aiding the enemy. Such self-governance by the county is truly detrimental to the people's food supply. We request that you forward our plea to your esteemed association and urgently telegraph the Anhui Provincial Government to strictly prohibit such behavior. Anhui province is a rich rice-producing area, and has historically supplied surplus grain to other areas with large populations. This time, Hexian has detained more than a hundred rice boats, and has even accused them of aiding the enemy based on unfounded speculation, acting arbitrarily and clearly violating government orders. At this time of peak sales of new grains, suddenly blocking the outflow is no different from adding shackles to Anhui farmers. Furthermore, Shanghai relies on neighboring provinces for its food supply, which will cause extreme panic. Our association, mindful of this, is deeply concerned. Therefore, we are forwarding this information to you and request that your esteemed association promptly petition the Anhui Provincial Government to strictly order Hexian to immediately release all detained grain boats, and to issue an order to all subordinate counties that they must not deliberately obstruct grain transport in the future, in accordance with the Central Government's intention to circulate domestic rice and grain. This is our earnest prayer.</p>
<p>Letter to the Chamber of Commerce II</p>
<p>Respected Sirs, regarding the ban on grain exports from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, our association previously sent a letter requesting your esteemed association to telegraph the governments of both provinces, requesting the lifting of the ban. We received a reply from the Zhejiang Provincial Government, a telegram from Chairman Huang, stating that surplus grain for transport must be formally certified by your association, and transportation permits must be obtained at the place of purchase and transport, in accordance with the province's food import and export registration regulations, to prevent smuggling, etc. A copy of the Zhejiang Provincial Food Import and Export Registration Regulations was also enclosed. Previously, our association received a copy of Chairman Huang's reply from the local association of this city, and immediately agreed with your esteemed association to handle the certification procedures. Meanwhile, we requested the local association to petition the Zhejiang Provincial Government to order all subordinate counties to facilitate the purchase and transport of food by Shanghai grain merchants, based on the certification documents from your esteemed association, without any obstruction. Currently, our colleagues purchasing food from Zhejiang province all report to our association for verification and then request your esteemed association to issue certificates, which are then presented to the local grain merchants at the place of purchase, who then directly submit them to the local county or city government for the issuance of transportation permits. This is in full compliance with Articles 3 and 4 of the Zhejiang Provincial Food Import and Export Registration Regulations, which have already been implemented. However, our colleagues have repeatedly reported that Jiashing, Leqing, Pingyang, Linhai, Huangyan, Wenling and other counties claim that they have not received provincial orders and refuse to allow the transport of food awaiting transport that holds certificates from your esteemed association. Such obstruction is burdensome for merchants. We are again writing to earnestly request your esteemed association to urgently telegraph the Zhejiang Provincial Government to order Jiashing and other counties to comply with the provisions of Article 3 of the registration regulations and promptly issue transportation permits for food awaiting transport that holds certificates from your esteemed association, so as to facilitate circulation and maintain the people's food supply. We are extremely grateful and anxious. Sincerely,</p>
<p>Reply Telegram from Zhejiang Province</p>
<p>Our Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a reply telegram from Chairman Huang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government yesterday, stating that, having read both telegrams, the province's rice production is not sufficient for self-sufficiency. All surplus rice from Wenzhou and Taizhou areas should be coordinated and regulated within the province. As for grain transported from Jiaxing to Shanghai, it should be handled prudently within a reasonable limit, based on the previous exchange of documents and telegrams between your city and various organizations and groups. Sincerely,</p>
<p>Petition to the Ministry of Railways</p>
<p>Soybeans are the raw material for producing oilcake. Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and other provinces are the richest in soybean production. The factories in Shanghai rely on these provinces for their supply. We have received reports from our member association, Changde and other oil factories, stating that in recent months, soybeans and miscellaneous grains purchased from the production areas in Anhui province have been unable to be exported due to a lack of vehicles. At each station in Xuzhou, Bengbu, and Linhuaiguan, goods are piled up like mountains and cannot be exported. The source of supply to Shanghai is scarce, and factories are facing the risk of not having rice to cook. The market price of soybeans and grains has also continued to rise as a result. Moreover, the accumulation of goods will inevitably lead to mold and spoilage, and the stagnation of finances will cause difficulties in turnover, which will affect commerce. This is no trivial matter. If no measures are taken to dredge this situation, panic will appear immediately. The aforementioned situation is factual. We are now submitting this document to your ministry, requesting that you promptly order the stations in Xuzhou, Bengbu, and Lingguan to allocate vehicles and give priority to exporting the stockpiled soybeans and miscellaneous grains, in order to clear the accumulated goods, facilitate transport to Shanghai, and maintain commerce. We would be immensely grateful. Sincerely,</p>
<h3>Support for Suiyuan from All Sectors; Grain Organizations</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, bean and rice merchants and various grain organizations from Guangdong, Hubei, Chaozhou, Shantou, Fujian, Zhenjiang, and other regions held an emergency meeting on the third floor of the Grain and Oilcake Traders Association on Minquan Road. Over twenty committee members attended, including Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, He Zisheng, Jiang Hongbin, Cai Yukun, Chuan Changyu, Ye Hongfan, and Gan Yuming. Gu Xinyi chaired the meeting, with Kong Ruling as the recorder. After the customary formalities, the chairman first reported on the situation of the bandits and puppets invading Suiyuan, and the heroic suppression by Chairman Fu and his troops. A resolution was immediately passed to establish a Grain Industry Support Suiyuan Fundraising Committee, and the committee members of eight grain organizations were appointed as ex officio members. These are (Bean) Cuixiu Hall, (Rice) Rengu Hall, (Guangdong) Shenshou Hall, (Hubei) Zhicheng Hall, (Chaozhou) Chaozhou Sugar and Sundries Trade Association, (Shantou) Quanzhang Guild Hall and Jin Hui Guild Hall, (Fujian) Sanshan Guild Hall, (Zhenjiang) Jiyuan Hall. A fundraising campaign among the industry will begin soon. The rationale for the fundraising is as follows: (Omitted above) Suiyuan is a vital national defense fortress. The gains and losses of Suiyuan are related to the survival of North China. Its importance cannot be overstated. Fortunately, our Chairman Fu and his generals deeply understand this great significance, vowing to defend our borders. Fighting fiercely through snowy nights, shedding blood on the yellow sands, fighting for the survival of the nation, and adding glory to the country. Their spirit is high in the cold wind. News of their victories spread frequently and excited the whole country. We, the grain industry colleagues, are all Chinese descendants, with our own families and businesses. Saving the country is saving ourselves. We cannot lag behind. Donating airplanes to serve the country, we have exhausted our meager efforts. At this time when soldiers are dying on the battlefield, it is time for us to destroy our homes to help the country. Therefore, we gathered at this meeting to discuss and implement plans together. We hope that our colleagues will act swiftly and enthusiastically donate. We must urgently comfort the soldiers who are fighting in the frozen land, and we must protect and rescue the compatriots who have suffered the brutality of the bandits. The rise and fall of the nation hangs by a thread, and our benevolence and righteousness lie here. This is our appeal. A telegram was also sent to Chairman Fu, saying: "Chairman Fu of Suiyuan, please forward this to the frontline generals to note: The bandits and puppets have invaded. Fortunately, we rely on you and your generals to bravely fight and severely damage the enemy. Your righteous reputation has spread, and everyone admires you. We hope that you will continue your efforts and firmly defend our territory. Our colleagues will surely economize on food and clothing and do our best to help. We send this telegram to comfort you, and look forward to your great achievements."</p>

We are extremely impressed and admire you. All members of this brigade are excited and regret that we cannot follow you to fight the bandits and puppets to express our will. In addition to raising funds from all sectors to provide comfort, we are sending this telegram from afar. The entire members of the 10th Brigade of the Shanghai Civic Training Center salute."</p>
<p>Lace Embroidery Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lace and Drawnwork Industry Association is organizing fundraising to support Suiyuan, stating: "The bandits and puppets are invading the border, and the situation in Suiyuan is serious. National sovereignty and the lives of the people are of utmost importance. In the depths of winter, snow flies on the border, and the cold is piercing. The soldiers on the front lines endure the cold and fight against the enemy, and the people are bleeding, sacrificing their lives for the country, fighting for the survival of the people and preserving the integrity of the territory. We are deeply moved and admire their determination. Patriotic people who hear of this are shocked and are rushing to provide comfort, destroy their homes to help the country, encourage and assist, all sharing the same sentiment. Our colleagues in the industry must not ignore this. We must urgently help each other and act as a backing to boost the morale of the soldiers. This is of utmost importance."

<h3>Seamen's慰勞金 Association Sends Telegrams to Chiang and Others</h3>
<p>The Chinese Seamen's慰勞金 Committee for慰勞金 the Soldiers in Suiyuan Who Suppressed Bandits, because of the bandit army's invasion of Suiyuan, Chairman Chiang directed the command and the soldiers fought bravely to suppress them, resulting in their defeat. Yesterday, telegrams were sent separately to慰勞金 them as follows: (1) To Chairman Chiang in Luoyang: The bandits disturbed Suiyuan East. Thanks to our soldiers who bravely suppressed them, they were able to be pacified. However, their arrival has its origins, so they will inevitably invade again. You have come to guide and your efforts are strenuous. At this time, all parties are angry, and we only hope to wield our spears and destroy them, permanently securing our country. We have prepared壶浆 and await the news of victory. The Chinese Seamen's慰勞金 Committee for慰勞金 the Soldiers in Suiyuan Who Suppressed Bandits.(2) To Director Yan in Taiyuan, Mr. Baichuan: The bandits invaded Suiyuan, and the northern gate was about to be destroyed. Our flesh is injured, and our hearts are in pain. You directed the soldiers to bravely suppress them, allowing them to take the lead in输边. Their righteousness is shocking, and their loyalty and filial piety are admirable. We only hope that our military will be strong and destroy those ugly creatures. We have prepared simple food and wish to犒王師. The Chinese Seamen's慰勞金 Committee for慰勞金 the Soldiers in Suiyuan Who Suppressed Bandits.(3) To Chairman Chuan in Suiyuan, Mr. Yisheng: Jin and Sui are the keys to our northern gate. In the past, during the Tang and Yu dynasties, the central government was located there. The achievements of Yu the Great and the Great Wall of the Qin Emperor are all shining examples of governing to protect the people. What kind of bandits dare to invade so deeply? We still hope that you will uphold the solid achievements of Zhuozhou and revive the merits of Jinwen. Li Ling's five thousand and Meng Tian's seven hundred are willing to be Xian Gao.

<h3>Representative of the National Labor Maritime Conference Zhao Banfu to Arrive in Shanghai Yang Anguo Returns Home on the Same Ship The Maritime Community Prepares to Welcome Them</h3>
<p>At the 21st International Maritime Conference, China's labor representative, Jian, appointed Zhao Banfu to attend. Later, at the 22nd session held, he still represented the labor side. During Zhao's attendance, due to his proper handling, all the proposals submitted by our country were approved one by one. The most important one, such as the working hours of Chinese workers employed by foreign shipping companies, calculated at 48 hours per week, has been reported in the newspapers. Therefore, his achievements exceeded those of previous conferences, and he was also appointed as a standing committee member of the International Seafarers' Federation, Joint Maritime Commission, which is truly an honor for our country. It is learned that Zhao Banfu, after the completion of the conference, has boarded the Italian merchant ship Conte Rosso and is returning home, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai the day after tomorrow (the 24th). Accompanying him is also Yang Anguo, the eldest son of Commander Yang Xiaotian, a special commissioner of the中华海员工会, who was originally a government-sponsored student studying military affairs in Germany and has now completed his studies and returned home to serve. He is also returning on the same ship. The Chinese Seamen's Special Party Department yesterday issued a notice to all seamen's associations, requesting that they send representatives to the Gonghexiang Wharf at 10:00 am on that day to welcome them.

<h3>Shanghai Pudong Association's New Clubhouse Inauguration Ceremony and Opening of the 5th General Assembly Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Pudong Association's new clubhouse on Rue Edouard (east end of Chengdu Road) was inaugurated. The ceremony was held at 10:00 AM, followed by entertainment starting at 2:00 PM. Approximately 10,000 guests and fellow villagers attended. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>Yesterday's attendees included Mayor Wu, Tao Baichuan, Cai Jingguo, Lu Jingshi, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Binghui, Gu Xinyi, Du Chongyuan, Yuan Ludeng, Shen Junru, Yu Zuoting, Jin Tingxun, Lu Bohong, and others. Over 20,000 members arrived successively. Du Hall, as well as the halls on the sixth floor like Yi Hall, Chuansha Hall, Water Conservancy Hall, and Guanghua Hall, were all packed, extremely lively. Association directors and supervisors Pan Zhiwen, Chen Zixin, Zhu Shaoyi, Zhu Yunzhang, Mu Wenyun, Gu Wensheng, Yu Zhenhui, Pan Hongding, Jin Hongxiang, Zhai Shao Yi, Zhang Bochu, Gong Huibai, Jia Jinfang, Cai Jun Tu, Xing Zhigang, Han Shangde, Tao Qinwen, and others served as hosts. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Scout troop of Sze Sheng Middle School were present to maintain order, which was quite helpful. Additionally, the Pui Yik Vocational School and the Soochow General Hospital military bands provided entertainment, which was very orderly.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony Order</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM, music was played and firecrackers were set off. Zhang Qizhi presented the key, and Chairman of the Standing Committee Du Yuesheng opened the door. Music was played. Standing Committee members Mu Ouchu, Huang Renzhi, and Lü Yuequan raised the flags. After Mayor Wu Tiecheng unveiled the plaque, music was played to start the meeting. Du, Mu, Huang, and Lü, along with Standing Committee member Shen's representative Pan Zhiwen, supervisors Lin Kang, Qin Yanqi, Wang Yiting, and Chen Taoyi, formed the presidium. Gu Wensheng served as the master of ceremonies, and Cai Jun Tu and Yu Zhenhui served as the recorders. The ceremony proceeded as planned. Chairman of the Standing Committee Du reported that many guests from various sectors had come to participate in the inauguration ceremony of the Pudong Association. The people of Pudong were very grateful. There are many people from Pudong in Shanghai, but only now do we have a Pudong Association address. The people of Pudong are truly ashamed. Now that the people of Pudong have a clubhouse for the association, we should work hard to connect emotionally with fellow villagers and to develop local businesses in Pudong. The Chinese people have particularly good feelings towards their fellow villagers. Every province and region has its own association. With a fellow villager organization, fellow villagers will no longer be scattered like sand, and only then can we unite. Now that China's national crisis is urgent, if the fellow villager associations in various provinces and regions can connect and form a large united organization, it would be a large fellow villager association of the Republic of China, unanimously resisting foreign aggression and not being bullied by others. Today, the Pudong Association is holding a meeting, and guests from all walks of life have come here. Thank you very much. If the hospitality is not good enough, please forgive our neglect.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's speech stated: "Ladies and gentlemen, today the Pudong Association is holding the inauguration ceremony of its new clubhouse. I am deeply honored to be able to participate in this grand event and to unveil the plaque. The completion of the new Pudong Association clubhouse can be said to be the foundation of Shanghai's enterprise and also the foundation of Shanghai's future prosperity. Because Pudong is one of the important areas of Shanghai, and it produces many talented people, many social leaders are from Pudong. They all compete to be first in public welfare undertakings and are eager to do good. Therefore, the people of Pudong have made great achievements in Shanghai's undertakings. Now that the new Pudong Association clubhouse is completed, the unity will be even more consolidated, and the development of local undertakings will be further promoted. Therefore, I say that it is the foundation of Shanghai's enterprise and also the foundation of future prosperity. The organization of the fellow villager association is to show sincerity, unity, and mutual assistance. In today's society, we must not be like 'chickens and dogs not hearing each other,' and we must not 'sweep the snow from our own doorstep.'"</p>
<p>Speeches from Various Sectors</p>
<p>Next, Tao Baichuan delivered a speech, stating that the essence of organizing a fellow villager association is nothing more than connecting feelings and seeking local welfare. The establishment of the Pudong Association demonstrates the greatness of the spirit of unity among the people of Pudong. Then, Zhang Binghui delivered a speech on behalf of Director Pan, stating that there are many fellow villager associations, but the Pudong Association is particularly sound. With this foundation, it will be able to assume the responsibility of stabilizing the country in the future. Then, Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, stating that in the past, fellow villager associations were guilds and public offices, but they mostly focused on passively handling charitable and public welfare affairs. The Pudong Association is a rising star, which is truly admirable. Then, Jiang Wenyu gave a speech, stating that the Pudong Association has a great spirit and a brand-new construction, integrating material and spiritual aspects into one. This is due to the excellent members leading in the front and the sound members assisting in the rear. What is especially admirable is that they can extend from fellow villagers to all mankind, which can be said to have a true spirit of serving society. Then, Huang Renzhi gave a thank-you speech, first expressing gratitude to the party and government representatives and guests, and then encouraging the people of Pudong with four points: (1) The people of Pudong must constantly seek to increase their knowledge and abilities. (2) The people of Pudong must do their duty in a down-to-earth manner. (3) The people of Pudong must abandon private views and private interests, unite and serve the public, serve the country, and serve all mankind. (4) The people of Pudong must strive forward and develop the spirit of daily renewal. After the speech, music was played and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Entertainment and Visits</p>
<p>There were a large number of attendees that day. Fortunately, the eight-story building allowed guests and members to visit separately, so the order was still quite orderly. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, entertainment began. The programs in Du Hall included Deng Guoqing's amazing skills, the Tongzi Feixuan troupe's novel art, Zhang Qiaonong and Xu Lingling's jokes and humor, and martial arts performances. In Yi Hall on the sixth floor, there were silk and bamboo music and local dramas, etc., full of energy and enthusiasm, greatly increasing the interest of the audience. At 8:00 PM, there was Peking opera, all performed by famous amateur performers and ladies, which was also very exciting. At 12:00 PM, there was also Sichuan opera. Since the association had many guests and members, Zhai Jun specially formed a rescue team, with interns from Sheng Sheng Hospital and students from Sheng Sheng School taking on the duties. For lunch, the Pudong Friendship Dining Association held a dinner, which members praised as convenient.</p>
<h3>New Life Movement Conference Decides on Principles to Abolish Extra Gratuities; Labor and Management of Various Industries to Formulate Methods; Scheduled to Implement Starting January 1, 1937</h3>
<p>The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association convened the fifth meeting yesterday, gathering relevant industries, labor, and management to continue discussing the abolition of extra gratuities.</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>Attendees included Jiang Hao, secretary of the New Life Movement Promotion Association; Zhu Weichang of the Motor Vehicle Drivers' Union; Zhang Daxin of the Yunfei Motor Vehicle Drivers' Union; Li Mancun of the Restaurant Industry Association; Zhan Wenxi, Yao Songping, Sun Qiuping, Gao Weifu, Zhang Zhicheng, Xia Tingliang, Li Sichao, Zou Juncheng of the Hotel Industry Association; and Xie Renchen, a representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, etc. Chairman Jiang Hao reported on the progress and current situation of the abolition of extra gratuities, hoping that the industries would formulate a feasible implementation plan based on the methods and principles agreed upon by the General Assembly. After discussion, it was decided that before December 25 of this year, detailed methods should be discussed and agreed upon by labor and management of various industries based on the four principles formulated and submitted to the association for review, so that they could be implemented starting on January 1, 1937.</p>
<p>Agreed Principles</p>
<p>(1) Workers in various industries should determine their wages. For those who have not yet determined their wages, the standards should be negotiated separately by labor and management of each company and reported to the municipal government for record. (2) The temporary collection of gratuities should be based on the principle that the majority belongs to the labor side. The distribution method should be negotiated by labor and management. (3) Large guarantee deposits should be replaced by shop guarantees in the future. If there are special circumstances and cash must be collected, it should be deposited in a reliable bank and interest should be paid according to regulations. (4) Workers are absolutely not allowed to solicit gratuities from customers in the future.</p>
<h3>Ye Fukan's Embezzlement Case Has Been Prosecuted</h3>
<p>The case of lawyer Ye Fukan, who was accused by Wang Hanqing in the Ministry of Justice of embezzling a large amount of money by means of a case, was investigated by the Shanghai District Court. Ye paid 20,000 yuan in cash bail. Yesterday, the court's notice board announced the indictment (No. 846) from the prosecutor, accusing Ye Fukan of embezzlement and filing a public prosecution. Therefore, the indictment has also been served, and the trial should be opened in court soon.</p>
<h3>The Policeman Shot by Thieves Has Died Yesterday</h3>
<p>Police officer Xu Zhishun of the Linping Road Police Station was shot in the abdomen by thieves while arresting thieves at the end of Gongping Road in Zhabei the night before last. The details have been recorded in previous reports. It is now learned that the police officer, after being sent to the Tongren Hospital for treatment, could not be cured due to the wound penetrating the intestines and died in the hospital. Yesterday, the local guarantor Xu Jinlin was ordered to report to the District Court for an autopsy. Prosecutor Hu was commissioned to conduct an autopsy along with the inspectors. After arriving at the scene, they verified the facts and completed the autopsy report, ordering the arrest of the murderers.</p>
<h3>Accused of Stealing a Letter, Zhang Zhifan Acquitted and Released</h3>
<p>The Guohua Obstetrics Hospital at No. 134 Kunming Road is run by the brothers Zhang Wenxing and Zhang Zhifan from Fujian. Before the 29th of last month, a registered letter was sent from Xiashi to the hospital. The letter stated that it should be received by Di Shilin, a female nurse in the hospital, and transferred to Wang Manying. The sender was Wang Manying's younger brother. The letter also included a small remittance of ten yuan. However, Di did not receive the letter. Wang Manying inquired with Di, but there was no result. She reported it to the police. After investigation by the post office, it was discovered that the return receipt for the letter had the Guohua Hospital seal on it, and Zhu Wenyi, an inspector of the bureau, testified that the seal on the return receipt was affixed by Zhang Zhifan. The police arrested Zhang Zhifan and handed him over to the First Special Court, which filed a public prosecution against him for theft and obstructing secrecy. He was detained for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai Rongduo opened the Fifth Criminal Court for a new trial. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian presented the case and questioned Zhang Zhifan, who denied receiving the letter. As for the seal, it was affixed by the post office to make up for it. He did not know whether he had received the letter before. He hired lawyer Yang Ruinian to defend him.

<h3>Counterfeiting Japanese Ten-Sen Coins, One Criminal Commits Suicide by Poison, Li Yunshi's Body Autopsied Yesterday, Remaining Liquid Sent to Municipal Council for Analysis, Another Criminal Zhu Xing San Denies Counterfeiting</h3>
<p>At 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, two Japanese detectives were dispatched by the Japanese Consulate to report to the Hongkou Police Station, stating that there were two Chinese people counterfeiting Japanese ten-sen coins. The location was at No. 52, Lane 172, Kunyou Road. The police station dispatched Western Detective Aiertsi and Chinese Detective No. 157 to secretly go to the address. They found two people, Li Yunshi (47 years old) from Nanjing and Zhu Xingshan (44 years old) from Shandong, and found 30 counterfeit ten-sen coins at the site. They were all taken back to the police station. After questioning, they learned the location of the counterfeit coin factory. The detectives took the two defendants to the residence of Yun Zhi at No. 14 Shunchang Lane, Jumen Road in Nanshi. They found several small packages of metal materials. At that moment, Li suddenly took a can of liquid poison from the window sill and swallowed it. The detective urgently stopped him, but Li's face turned pale and he foamed at the mouth. The detectives sent him to Shanghai Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective and he died. The body was taken to the autopsying place on Feilun Road to await autopsy. The detectives brought the liquid and other items back to the police station. Yesterday morning, Zhu Xingsan was first sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court and was approved to be detained. Then, the Procuratorate of the Court was requested to commission Prosecutor Tang to conduct an autopsy with forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and Clerk Wang Zuyi. The autopsy confirmed the body. According to Chinese Head Constable Xu Shunqing, the case was reported to the Japanese Consulate by a Japanese informant. It was then known that the family of the informant was on Kunshan Road. On the 10th of this month, the two defendants took 30 counterfeit ten-sen coins to that place as samples. They went again yesterday and were arrested. When the deceased took the poison, he was pointing at the evidence and took it before anyone could stop him. According to Zhu Xingsan, he lives at No. 478 Qingshun Lane, Bai'er Road and works as a customs broker. He met the deceased in February or March of this year. He went to Qishan Road that day to collect commissions and denied counterfeiting ten-sen coins. Prosecutor Tang, after hearing the statements and the autopsy, determined that the deceased Li Yunshi, male, died of poison. Before the family members are identified, the body will be sent to the Pushan Villa for safekeeping. In order to clarify the name of the liquid poison, Tang ordered the police station to send it to the Municipal Council for analysis and ordered that the body be temporarily kept out of the coffin or dissected.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Murder of the Owner of Hongxing Tobacco and Paper Store: Li Gensheng's Concubine Suddenly Disappears, Suspected of Being Hidden by the Store Owner, So He Went to Avenge, Two Murderers Detained Pending Rescheduled Interrogation</h3>
<p>The wife of Kuang Hongsheng, the owner of Hongxing Tobacco and Paper Grocery Store at No. 1182 Gordon Road, works as a female foreman at the Tongyi Yarn Factory on Mozishan Road. However, one of the female workers, Aidi, is the concubine of Li Gensheng from Ningbo. This time, Aidi was laid off from work and disappeared. Li Gensheng suspected that Kuang and his wife were hiding her and held a grudge. He wanted to harm them, so he discussed revenge with Yao Ronggen and Wang Jinshan, two locals living at No. 21 Dunmu Lane, Guoqing Road, Zhabei. Zhang provided the guns and bullets. At around 11:00 PM the night before last, they went to the Hongxing Tobacco and Paper Store together. Li Gensheng took out a gun and fired a shot, hitting Kuang Hongsheng in the left brain. Li was about to continue firing, but the bullet jammed, so he could not continue. He turned around and fled in different directions. At that time, a Chinese policeman No. 1941 was on duty at the intersection of Gordon Road and Robert Road. He suddenly heard gunshots and saw Li Gensheng running, so he chased after him. Li knew he was defeated and quickly threw away the gun, but was still caught and the gun and bullets were recovered. At the same time, Chinese policemen No. 3266 and No. 85 also heard the shouts and saw Wang Jinshan running away, so they chased and caught him. Chinese policemen No. 3396 and No. 3221 saw the owner of Hongxing Tobacco and Paper Store, Kuang Hongsheng, lying in a pool of blood, so they took him to the police station and ordered the injured to be sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. Detective Jia Di was in charge of the investigation. Based on the confession of the captured criminals, the location of Yao Ronggen's hiding place was discovered. Police detectives from the Public Security Bureau went to No. 21 Dunmu Lane, Guoqing Road and arrested Yao. At that time, Yao was wearing a No. 8 uniform from the Daguangming Cinema. He was detained in the Public Security Bureau pending transfer. Yesterday morning, Li and Wang were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court and prosecuted for attempted murder under Article 271, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Police lawyer Wang Yaoxun rose and presented the case, stating that after the victim Kuang Hongsheng was sent to the hospital, the doctor confirmed that he was injured in the left shoulder and the bullet had exited the lungs. He was seriously injured and his life was in danger. Therefore, after arresting the defendants, Li Gensheng admitted that he fired the gun. Wang Jinshan initially denied it, so Li was taken to Renji Hospital, where Kuang clearly identified him as the perpetrator. Kuang's life or death is uncertain, so he requested a postponement and requested a document to be issued to the police station to transfer Yao Ronggen from the Public Security Bureau for a joint interrogation. He presented the recovered guns, bullets, bullet casings, etc. Kuang Hongsheng stated that Aidi is my concubine. This time, she disappeared because she was hidden by Kuang and taken to another place. Therefore, last night, he invited Wang and Yao to find Aidi. The gun was provided by Yao. At that time, he only threatened Kuang. Unexpectedly, Kuang stepped forward to grab it, so he fired a shot at him, hitting Kuang in the left chest. Wang Jinshan confessed to going with him, but only acted as a lookout at the door. Judge Huang Risheng ordered the two defendants to be detained for a rescheduled interrogation in seven days.</p>

<h3>China Obstetrics Hospital Scheduled to Perform a Play to Raise Funds, The Poor People's Delivery Department to Borrow the Golden Grand Theater on the 28th to Perform a Play</h3>
<p>Pan Hao, the director of the China Obstetrics Hospital at the entrance of Tanjing Lane, Zhonghua Road, Nanshi, is usually very enthusiastic about social service. The hospital has attached a free delivery department for poor people since two years ago. In recent years, the number of poor people who have been admitted to the hospital for delivery has been increasing, and the results have been quite good. However, due to the exhaustion of funds, it is planned to raise donations. With the enthusiastic support of philanthropists in Shanghai, it was approved to borrow the Golden Grand Theater on the afternoon of the 28th of this month.

<h3>Substitute for Dancing Girls: Embezzlement of Engagement Money Leads to Punishment; Original Thief Found with Money in His Trousers Pocket; Xiao Peilin Sentenced to Fifty Days of Detention</h3>
<p>Li Te, a Korean manager of the Cathay Dance Hall in Hong Kong, recently came to Shanghai with a Chinese man named Yan Lanting to recruit dancing girls. They stayed in Room 311 of the New World Hotel. At that time, they entrusted Xiao Peilin, a Ningbo native and president of the Art Sea Dancing Research Institute at No. 14 Daqing Lane, Nanjing Road, to find suitable candidates. Soon, Xiao claimed to have found three dancers from the Vienna Dance Hall: Zhang Bixia, Zhang Qingying, and Pan Jiaoli. He showed their photos to Li Te, but said that each girl required an upfront settlement fee of 30 yuan before agreeing to go. Li Te paid the full amount. Later, Xiao also invited Lu Ying and Fang Mei, female employees of the Metropolitan Guide Agency, to Li's room, encouraging them to go to Hong Kong as dancing partners. Lu and the others agreed, but also requested a settlement fee of 30 yuan each. Li Te then paid Xiao 10 yuan, instructing him to forward it, with the remaining 20 yuan to be paid upon departure. However, after Xiao received the 130 yuan from Li, he did not distribute it to the dancers and disappeared. Later, Li encountered him on the street and had him detained at the New Zha Police Station, from where he was brought to the First Special District Court for interrogation. The case was awaiting sentencing. Yesterday morning, Ye Shengchao, a judge, took the stand in the Second Criminal Court. Qian Xunjiu, a lawyer from the police station, immediately requested a retrial, arguing that during the previous hearing, the defendant completely denied receiving any money from Li Te. After the court declared the hearing closed, while the defendant was being escorted to the waiting room, 40 Hong Kong dollars and 20 dollars in Shandong China Communication Bank notes, totaling 60 yuan, were found in Xiao's trousers pocket. Li Te identified this as part of the money he had given to the defendant. According to Xiao, the money was hidden in the lining of his suit, so it was not found during the initial search. He thought there would be no further search after the hearing, so he took it out, only to have it discovered. Li Te testified that the money was indeed what he had paid. When questioned, Xiao continued to try to deny it, claiming it was given to him by a friend. Judge Ye sentenced Xiao to 50 days of detention and ordered the Hong Kong dollars to be returned to the plaintiff.</p>

<h3>Navigation in Shanghai-Hankou Route: Draft Limited to Ten Feet</h3>
<p>Wuhu Section Sets Shipping Regulations; Yangtze River Water Level Continues to Drop; Large Ships Suspend Operations; According to a Datong News Agency reporter, it was recently learned from the customs that the draft limit for ships on the Yangtze River from Shanghai to Hankou is 14 feet 4 inches from Wuhu to Jiujiang, and only 10 feet 5 inches from Jiujiang to Hankou. As the river water continues to recede daily, the impact on river transport is significant. Furthermore, the water fee for the Shanghai-Hankou line, which various shipping companies used to levy starting in February of the following year, will now be levied starting on the first of next month, indicating the unprecedented changes in the Yangtze River this year. In addition, the Wuhu section of the Shanghai-Hankou route is the narrowest and shallowest for navigation. Therefore, during this period of shallow water, the customs have specially formulated the following regulations based on the current situation: "Wuhu Channel" navigation guide: keep a distance of two chains from the shore, pass the Wuhu customs with the ship's bow pointing directly at the Wuhu Channel light pylon, approach the right bank and keep a distance of one chain from the shore. Follow this distance along the shore until reaching the Wuhu Channel light pylon, then take the route with the ship's starboard side half a ship's length away from the Qingyun lightship, and pass the lightship.</p>

Over three weeks, they treated and cured over 2,000 people, spending 2,300 yuan on medicine. The most severe infection was malignant malaria.

<h3>The Sino-Foreign Relief Association Continues to Operate the Qingjiangpu Porridge Factory</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Ni Bingdong, the representative of the Qingjiangpu Puhui Porridge Factory, at the Sino-Foreign Relief Association at No. 97 Renji Road yesterday, the famine in Qingjiangpu, Jiangbei, has been recurring every year, and the poverty in the area is indescribable. Winter is approaching, and without the urgent operation of a porridge factory, it will be difficult to maintain the lives of the disaster victims. He also presented a letter requesting assistance, which is recorded as follows: "Respected Association, the Puhui Porridge Factory has been subsidized by your association for many years, benefiting the disaster victims in countless ways. In the blink of an eye, winter is approaching again, and we plan to prepare for distribution immediately. Although the harvest in various provinces this year has been very good, the northern part of Huaiyin is located in a remote corner, and most of the fields are low-lying. This autumn, it first suffered from drought, followed by rain. The harvest is still not as good as in other places, and there are many people without fields or jobs. Therefore, the so-called poor land and poor people mean that even in a year of abundance, there are still many people eating porridge every winter. For this reason, we earnestly request that you provide assistance with funds, winter clothing, etc., as in previous years, so that we can widely save the hungry people. The merits will be immeasurable." According to the factory, it has been operating for more than 30 years. Qingjiang is indeed considered the poorest area in Jiangbei. Every winter, disaster victims flock south to eat porridge. The operation is not only to prevent people from wandering on the roads, but also to ensure the peace of the area. The relationship is very important, and the lives saved are numerous. We sincerely hope that all sectors will provide assistance in time, and the merits will be immeasurable.</p>
<h3>Amendments to the Regulations for the Management of Car Rental Companies</h3>
<p>The regulations for the management of car rental companies in this city were promulgated in September 1928 and have been in effect for eight years. They are no longer suitable for the current situation, and their scope is limited to car rental companies, excluding car sales and repair companies. This causes inconvenience in management. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has previously consulted with various related bureaus to amend the regulations. It is reported that the amended draft has been approved and promulgated by the municipal government.</p>

<h3>The Enamel Industry in Shanghai (A General Survey of Industry and Commerce in Shanghai - XXXVIII)</h3>
<p>— Edited by China Investigation</p>
<p>1. Overview. The position of enamel products in our daily necessities has become increasingly important. For example, bowls and plates for eating and drinking, large and small basins and buckets for washing, and common signboards are mostly enamel products. The difference between enamel products and our country's traditional porcelain is that the former is made of iron sheets, while the latter is made of clay, so the degree of strength and fragility varies greatly. As for the enamel powder coated on the surface, it is actually no different from our country's porcelain.</p>
<p>The raw materials for enamel products are relatively simple, mainly enamel powder and iron sheets. In the past, enamel powder was purchased from Japan. Later, the Hetian Enamel Powder Pharmaceutical Factory, founded by the Japanese in Shanghai, also provided a large part. After the Chinese-owned Yifeng, Zhonghua, and Zhufeng enamel factories successively produced enamel powder themselves, this raw material was no longer controlled by the Japanese. However, the raw materials for manufacturing enamel powder, such as feldspar and clay, are still mostly dependent on Japan, which is a drawback. Although China produces feldspar and clay, they are rarely mined and remain hidden in nature. Therefore, we must continue to strive to mine this raw material in order to achieve the true independence of the enamel industry. As for iron sheets, because they are products of heavy industry, China is still unable to produce them domestically, and it is even more necessary for us to work hard.</p>
<h3>The Kidnappers in the Xue Jiasheng Case Still Receive Original Sentence After Appeal; The Car Used by the Bandits Is Requested to Be Confiscated by the Police Station</h3>
<p>Xue Jiasheng, a wealthy businessman living at No. 5, Lane 1412, Avenue Joffre, French Concession (the third son of the late Xue Baorun, a giant in the dyestuff industry), was kidnapped by bandits for ransom on August 1 this year at 4 PM. On August 15, the French police solved the case and arrested five kidnappers: Chen Jintang, Bu Mingqing, Pu Yaozhang, Sun Yanan, and Wu Genyou. They were handed over to the Second Special Court. The police department prosecuted and tried the case accordings to the law. Chen Jintang was sentenced to 15 years in prison and deprived of civil rights for 10 years. Bu Mingqing was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for life. Wu Genyou was sentenced to 12 years in prison and deprived of civil rights for 10 years. Pu and Sun were found not guilty. Chen, Bu, and Wu appealed the verdict to the Third Branch of the High Court. Pu and Sun were released and regained their freedom after the police department abandoned the appeal. The appeal cases of Chen, Bu, and Wu were investigated several times by the Third Branch of the High Court, and the panel of judges summoned witnesses for trial. The details have been recorded in this publication. The case has now been concluded. Yesterday, Wu Tingqi, the head of the criminal court, along with judges Wang and Liao, rendered the verdict in the Third Criminal Court. The original judgment regarding Bu Mingqing was revoked. The crime was the same as in the first instance, but the words "repeat offender" were added. He was still sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for life. The appeals of Chen Jintang and Wu Genyou were rejected. After the sentence, the three criminals were ordered to be returned to the detention center. It is also reported that the car used to kidnap Xue was not seized when the case was solved because the bandits hid it. The detectives handling the case have now found the car and driven it back to the French police station. The police department has transferred it to the Second Special Court, requesting that the car be confiscated.</p>

<h3>Western League First Division: Nankai Second Team Victorious Over Western Police; First Half Ends 1-1, Final Score 4-2; Today's Match: Shanghai Football Club vs. Lakers</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the Western League First Division, Nankai Second Team achieved victory again, defeating Western Police 4-2 at Recreation Ground. With Chen Zhenxiang anchoring the center back position, Nankai's strength was significantly consolidated. Nankai opened the scoring in the first half, followed by a goal from each side. In the second half, Nankai scored three more goals to one. Both goals scored by Western Police were gifts from Nankai due to own goals. In reality, Western Police did not achieve anything on their own. Additionally, there were two important Second Division matches: Aurora College drew 3-3 with the French Army, and Dehan lost 1-2 to the British Navy.</p>
<p>Today's schedule: Shanghai Football Club vs. Lakers at Recreation Ground, starting at 3:00 PM. This is one of the important First Division matches for Western Police and also one of the toughest league matches for Shanghai Football Club this season. Although Lakers' key player, Bosselet, has left Shanghai, the team remains a formidable opponent. Their offensive and defensive strength is comparable to that of the French Merchants. The strength of Shanghai Football Club needs no introduction. The key to today's match lies in whether Shanghai's wingers can make good use of their opportunities. Shanghai originally had a 70% chance of winning this match, but one cannot be overly optimistic given Lakers' speed and skill. In addition, there are reserve matches: Shanghai Football Club Second Team vs. Shaoguer, Nankai Second Team vs. Laurel, and Youth Association vs. Jewish team in the Second Division, as well as six morning league matches, etc. The lineups and schedules for today's Shanghai Football Club vs. Lakers match are listed below:</p>

<p>Nankai Football Team played against Western Police in the Western League First Division match at Recreation Ground yesterday. After winning against St. Francis last week, Nankai, who had been sluggish for a long time, washed away their passive atmosphere and gradually became sharper and more active. With the well-coordinated team members, Nankai regained their inherent strength and felt invigorated. Western Police, after recently winning against St. Francis and the Western Chamber of Commerce, also had an unyielding spirit. Nankai was in high spirits, and the lively and active performance yesterday left Western Police at a loss. The first half ended in a 1-1 draw. In the end, Nankai won 4-2. However, the two goals conceded by Nankai were purely own goals, and Western Police did not achieve anything on their own.</p>

<p>Helei, Wuiswood, Gibson</p>
<p>Willie, Wu Lei, Pete, Te Fei, Oklei</p>
<p>Deadlock</p>
<p>At the start, Western Police Beilei arrived late, with only ten players. Shi Yongnan dribbled the ball to attack. After a long melee, there was no progress. Beilei hurriedly arrived and joined the battle, gaining the upper hand. They dribbled the ball and attacked, firing a strong shot. Ye Peichu dived to save it. Oklei took a corner kick, landing the ball well. Ye bravely punched it out. Not long after, Beilei came back again, shooting fiercely from the right corner of the penalty area. Ye Peichu was quick and agile, saving it again. Under Nankai's fierce attack, Wang Nanzhen launched a surprise attack, advancing along the side. As the ball reached the center, Wu Shufen headed it forcefully. The ball hit Man Ying's body, and Chen Mingzhi rushed up to shoot again, but the ball hit the goalpost and bounced back, to no avail.</p>
<p>Each Scores One Goal</p>
<p>Before long, Chen Mingzhi rose up and Wang Nanzhen passed the ball to the center. Wu Shufen rushed up and shot fiercely. The goalkeeper was caught off guard, and the scoring was opened. Western Police did not give up and tried their best to counterattack. Willie Huite rose up in the middle and shot from the penalty area. Ye Peichu did not pay attention and casually caught it, but the ball had already crossed the goal line. A goal was unnecessarily lost, resulting in a draw. Only two minutes were left until the end of the first half.</p>
<p>Second Own Goal</p>
<p>After the break, Yan Lianjin and Wang Nanzhen coordinated well, penetrating deep into enemy territory. Wu Shufen had a flash of inspiration and shot at the goal. The enemy was caught off guard, and the ball went into the right corner of the goal, making it 2-1. Western Police suffered a setback and their troops were determined to avenge their humiliation. They turned around the battlefield, dribbling the ball forward. With Turner's support, they raised their foot to attack the goal. Xu Hongyin tried to be clever but ended up making things worse. He intended to block it, but unexpectedly scored an own goal, sacrificing another goal for no reason.</p>
<p>Two Goals in a Row</p>
<p>Western Police made something out of nothing, and their morale soared. Willie took a corner kick, which was perfectly placed. Oklei headed it directly, but fortunately, Ye Peichu turned the danger into safety. Wang Nanzhen launched another attack, and Liu Yi's header was successful, but it was a pity that it was not a goal. Liu refused to give up, and with Wu Shufen working together, they attacked the enemy. Wu Shufen had excellent ball luck and scored from 15 yards, making it 3-1. Finally, Chen Mingzhi advanced along the sideline and passed the ball to the center. Shi Yongnan rushed up and kicked the ball, which went into the net, making it 4-2. Although Western Police tried their best to resist, they were unable to achieve their wishes. The whistle blew to end the game, and Nankai achieved victory for the second time with a score of 4-2.</p>
<h3>Chinese Football League, Group B: Guanghua Defeats Yousheng 4-1; Ten Matches Today</h3>
<p>There was one match in the Chinese Football Association's Chinese Character Group yesterday, between Guanghua and Yousheng. It took place at 3:00 PM at the Guanghua University Stadium on Daxilu Road. Although Guanghua had lost to Fudan before, they had been practicing diligently recently and their lineup was visibly strengthened. Yousheng's skills were also quite respectable. However, because it was a community team, they lacked regular practice and were not as cohesive as a school team. As a result, Guanghua won 4-1. Guanghua won by two clear goals in the first half.</p>
<h3>Two Important Matches in the Western League, Group B: Aurora and St. John's Struggle; Aurora Draws 3-3 with the French Army; St. John's Loses to the British Navy 1-2</h3>
<p>In the Western League Group B matches yesterday, there were three matches involving Chinese teams, all of which were very important. The performances were also excellent and had a great impact on the prospects of winning the championship. As a result, Aurora drew 3-3 with the French Army, and St. John's lost 1-2 to the British Navy. The result of another match, Qinghua vs. Health, is unknown.</p>
<p>Aurora College</p>
<p>The team's skills are quite strong. Since the beginning of the season, they have never been defeated, and their hopes of winning the championship are very high. Yesterday, they fought the French Army at Hongkou Park Second Field. The competition between the two sides was extremely intense. The French army put up a stubborn resistance, and their momentum was very strong. Aurora was also careful and cautious, fighting aggressively. Each side achieved gains, resulting in a 3-3 draw. It is a pity that Aurora failed to win consecutive victories and lost a valuable point.</p>
<p>St. John's</p>
<p>Also a victorious team, determined to win the championship. Yesterday, they met the British Navy at Shen Garden, believing that it would not be difficult to win consecutive victories. However, the British soldiers who fought yesterday were from a newly arrived fleet, with considerable strength. They competed equally. In the first half, neither side scored. At the beginning of the second half, St. John's students made a mistake and were immediately scored on by the soldiers. St. John's tried its best to counterattack, and their momentum was very strong. The ball often revolved in front of the British soldiers' goal. Finally, after more than twenty minutes, they returned the goal, making it a 1-1 tie. After that, there were mutual scares, but both sides were able to protect their positions. They were full of hope that they would draw the match. Unexpectedly, in the last four minutes, they were suddenly scored on by the British army with a goal that decided the winner, ending with a score of 2-1.</p>
<h3>Poor Coordination: Xin Team Loses to Xintong; Total Result: 43-32; Both Teams' Performances Lacked Distinctiveness</h3>
<p>Xin Team's basketball team played a friendly match against Xintong Team, formerly known as Pirates, at Shen Garden last night. Both teams' performances lacked distinctiveness, their coordination was poor, and their movements were slow. The players of Xin Team were past their prime. If they want to improve, they must abandon their outdated style of play and undergo regular training. Xintong led all the way in the whole game. The first half ended 19-15. The final score was 43-32.</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>The situation in the first 20 minutes was relatively even. After the start, Xintong scored five consecutive points. Xin Team united and counterattacked, with Feng Nianhua, Xu Wenkui, and Chen Xianglong scoring successively, once leading 14-13. The situation was quite good. Xintong strengthened their defense, and Carson, Lam, Yu, and others scored several times. Pisai Er did not want to be left behind, and the score increased to 19 points. Xin Team only scored one point from Wenkui's free throw, making it 15-19. Xin Team was behind again.</p>
<p>Second Half</p>
<p>In a lackluster manner, Xintong relied on Rhine and Steguer's coordination to raise the score steadily. When it reached 34 points, Xin Team only had 16 points, which was scored by Sun Baoqing's free throw. Then Chen Xianglong put the ball in from under the basket. After Xiao Feng scored a free throw, Xu Wenkui made a wonderful long shot, and the momentum suddenly rose. Then Wenkui and Xianglong added three more points, showing great improvement. However, Xintong continued to work harder, and Rhine, Carson, and others frequently scored. In the end, Xin Team lost 32-43. The two teams will play a second match next Wednesday to decide the winner.</p>
<p>Xintong</p>

Nanyang has famous players such as Zhang Shaoqing and Le Junchang, while Tibet has Hua Yulin, Dong Yangfeng, and Xu Jusheng. Therefore, the two sides were evenly matched. The first half ended in a 15-15 draw. In the second half, the Tibetan players coordinated effectively and won 32-24.</p>

Following this, there was talk of resolving the labor unrest issue next Monday, and the gold industry gang came out in large numbers, as well as China Cotton Company's large amount of swaps, so the market appeared slightly looser. In fact, there should have been a reaction after consecutive sharp rises.</p>
<p>Label Yarn Rose Near, Fell Far</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the label yarn market, the near month was very strong due to the bulls' preparations to take delivery, and continued to rise. However, in the second session, Osaka's Three Products Yarn entered a high state, and the Qingdao Yarn Factory's labor unrest has not yet been resolved.

In the afternoon opening, retail investors who were squeezed out became firm and saw new highs again, but those who profited in the far month closed out and fell back. By the time of the three sessions closing, it was said that the yarn factory strike would be resolved soon, and a certain factory had released 20-count Jincheng Double Deer Double Happiness yarn, so the market squeezed and挫.

Now the cotton mills need to be a little more active, and the inventory of cotton is strong, so there are still many people who are stubborn when prices rise.</p>
<p>Near Month Tongji扒空</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the label cotton market, the market was still calm because U.S. cotton rose and fell, up and down 1 to 6 pounds, and Indian cotton rose 2 rupees 25. After the second session, because the Tongji shorts covered their positions and the yarn market was good, the buying trend rose sharply, and the rising trend was urgent, with each month jumping 3 or 4 jiao. As a result, each month rose 4.5 to 5 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon opening, the market said that the yarn factory labor unrest could be calmed down, so buyers were active and the situation was tighter.

<h3>Speculators Focus on Cotton Yarn - This Month's 期 Rises 9 Yuan in a Week - Total Inventory 773,000 Bales</h3>
<p>Recently, the yarn factory labor unrest has been severe, and the Qingdao Yarn Factory has also been affected by strikes and slowdowns, so Osaka's Three Products Yarn has soared by 1.20 yuan.

Buyers are very active, and the market price is moving forward. The peak of yarn this month has reached 244 yuan, a new record since September 18. However, there are only two days left in the business this month, which ends on the 24th. The China Cotton Company has also swapped on the weekend, and a large number of gold industry gangs have come out, so the closing is slightly缓和. It was found that the price of this month's期 is 9 yuan higher than the previous week, and the far month has only risen by 8 jiao, which shows the intensity of the squeeze. It was found that the number of cotton yarn inventory accounts has increased sharply by 247,500 bales in the past week. (October 14) The total inventory was 526,000 bales. By yesterday, the total inventory had increased to 773,550 bales. Cotton increased sharply by 278,300 dan (October 14). The total inventory was 1,528,200 dan. By yesterday, it had increased to 1.6 million and 穴400 dan, which is less than cotton yarn. It can be seen that the speculators' target is concentrated on cotton yarn. From next month onwards, the期限 only has 4 months left. The number of long and short chips is increasing day by day and the期限 is shortened. The range of changes after the 期限 is expanding. The storms and huge waves in the future are difficult to predict.</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Rose and Fell Very Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened, and the market was sluggish. The December 期 continued to have bulls closing and swapping the far month. The market price did not move and fell 3 pounds. The situation in the market was due to hedging and bulls closing. Peers fell in a row and there were not many buys. Merchants were unwilling to risk a deal before the delivery notice was issued, so it was quite weak. At the same time, it is difficult to grasp what the market will be like after the December 期 is removed. The cloth market is strong, and this week's transactions far exceeded production. Spot cotton is firm. At the close, there was slight progress due to export needs, and it turned stable. It is estimated that spot goods fell 5 pounds and futures rose 1 pound to fall 6 pounds.

<h3>Piece Goods - The Factory's Fine Twill Spot Goods are Sold Out - There is a Particular Shortage of 彩條絨 in the Retail Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was still affected by the labor unrest in Japanese factories, and the yarn and thread market price continued to be strong. The cost of each cloth increased consistently, and the spot goods of each factory's fine cloth, fine twill, raw cloth, and坯布 were squeezed and lacking. Yesterday, the market continued to rise (per piece) by 5 fen to 1 jiao half. Among them, the demand for fine twill was the strongest and the market price was also the firmest. The spot goods of 5 or 60 brands of Chinese factory fine twill were sold out consistently, and the goods shipped from each factory in Changzhou every day were sold out as soon as they arrived, with the strongest demand from each port of the Yangtze River. The dyeing factories in this port purchased spot goods to replace the products of the Yihe factory because the bills of lading of the Japanese factories' empty warehouses were postponed. Each stall's coarse cloth, fine twill, and bleached cloth spot goods were extremely scarce. Yesterday, the factory side had no goods to sell. The business in the shops on this street was booming. The sales of 彩條絨 were the best. The goods dispatched every day were not enough for the counter to cut零剪. The sales盤 rose (per piece) by 3 jiao. The Zhigong Serge and Line呢 factories'盤 were also firm. Yesterday, each stall of the United States Heng factory's lineね was raised first (per yard) by 5 li because the supply was less than the demand. The Sichuan and Yunnan gangs 進 more than a hundred boxes of white, and the sales of 印花絨 blue cloth in the market gradually showed a lively trend. However, because each factory has a lot of 積, the sales盤 were 平平. The 印花直貢嗶嘰 was not strong because the demand from the Northern gangs was sluggish.</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea: Foreign Firms Seem Satisfied with Silk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market was firm. Sales of native silk were relatively quiet, probably due to the recent unpredictable trends in the silk market. Currently, people are generally taking a wait-and-see approach, and foreign merchants seem quite content. Consequently, there were not many sales throughout the day. In the foreign market, Yokohama's near and distant futures each rose slightly by two or three yuan. New York's standard silk rose by half a cent to one cent. However, the holding price of Japanese silk 83 and 75 average grades rose by about three cents. Guangdong silk and Shanghai silk also rose by about two to three cents. In the Lyon silk market, holding prices for various items increased by one to two francs, it is said.</p>
<h3>Oil and Hemp: Hemp Oil Rises with Raw Materials; New Huai Speed Goods Rise to Twenty-Six Yuan</h3>
<p>The hemp oil market situation: Although the current "Geng" year's raw material production is still plentiful, the price at the source is high, making the supply source difficult to flourish. The new goods market opened at twenty yuan, but the arrivals are insufficient. Clocks are still acceptable, so the market immediately increased to twenty-five yuan. By the beginning of this month, there was a sudden interest from Ningbo, and retail sales on this street also showed activity, with six to seven hundred transactions. The price was raised again to twenty-five yuan and five jiao. In recent days, due to the continuous rise in raw materials, sellers' minds have become increasingly firm. With tight selling prices, the market rose to twenty-six yuan yesterday at a distance. 500 transactions were made, handled by that "Er Bang." According to the current supply source, the trend is expected to remain stable. After the old oil market was stirred by the inland gangs, although the color and taste of the goods have deteriorated, the route of that gang has not decreased slightly. After the market opened at twenty-two yuan, goods holders, seeing the lively sales, have been raising prices more and more vigorously. The market price has gradually increased. Last month, the Jinlan gang made moves on the sidelines. This month, the Hangzhou gang continues to take goods without stopping, with no less than two to three thousand "ting" transacted before and after, being snapped up completely. The market has risen to twenty-three yuan and six jiao. Currently, it is said that there is no inventory of the old goods available on the market, it is said.</p>
<h3>"Without Air Defense, There is No National Defense"</h3>
<p>— Yang Gonghuai</p>
<p>Children, do you know? Modern warfare is three-dimensional warfare, because the area of war is no longer limited to flat land or the sea, but has developed into the air. In future wars, the air force will be the most effective in combat. It can fly nimbly to the enemy's position without waiting for the mobilization of the army and navy, destroying their defensive works, disrupting their rear, and putting the enemy in a situation where attack and defense are both impossible. A country that can strengthen the combat power of its air force is certainly the best strategy for warfare; to consolidate national defense and resist foreign insults, it is also necessary to work hard on air defense!</p>
<p>The importance of air defense, I believe children already understand. So, how should we implement air defense?</p>
<p>From a passive perspective, measures such as implementing blackout regulations, organizing fire brigades, and enhancing anti-gas equipment are all very important. But from an active perspective, to defend against air raids without military aircraft with real strength to fight enemy aircraft, there will never be a huge, safe air defense cover to protect the country's industrial and commercial centers and national defense fortresses. Therefore, to actively defend against air raids, it is essential to strengthen the real strength of the air force; this is extremely clear. Our country is now at a crossroads of survival. In the Battle of Shanghai and the Battle of the Great Wall, our country suffered greatly from the threat and ravages of the enemy's air force due to the weakness of our air defense capabilities. This lesson we will never forget. In the future, we should mobilize the nation's manpower and financial resources to strengthen air defense in order to cope with future crises. Children! Please reflect on whether you have fulfilled your responsibilities, directly or indirectly, in terms of air defense.</p>
<p>I remember a foreign military expert once said, "Without air defense, there is no national defense." This sentence is indeed true, and I hope all the children will keep it in mind!</p>
<h3>Random Tales of Children's Stories</h3>
<p>— Yi Sheng</p>
<p>Xie Daoyun's Eulogy on Willow Catkins</p>
<p>Xie An rose to the position of Grand Tutor, and his family was known for its elegance. They often gathered together to discuss poetry and prose, so that the family was filled with the sounds of chanting and reciting. One day in winter, when it was snowing heavily, Xie An again summoned his children to gather around the stove to appreciate the snow and discuss literature. After a while, the snow fell even harder and faster. Xie An happily recited, "What does the swirling white snow resemble?" A nephew, whose nickname was Hu'er, blurted out, "It's like scattering salt in the air." A girl's voice interjected, "It's not as good as willow catkins rising in the wind!" Everyone looked over and saw that it was Xie An's niece, Xie Daoyun, who couldn't resist expressing her opinion and continued with this line. Xie An greatly praised and rejoiced. To this day, when praising women's literary talent, people often cite the story of Xie Daoyun's eulogy on willow catkins as a comparison.</p>
<p>Children from families who uphold poetry and propriety, and literary families, are cultivated by family education on a daily basis, so their literary cultivation surpasses that of children from ordinary families. However, a person's innate intelligence and the elegance or vulgarity of their mind are always related to talent and are difficult to force. The uncle set the topic, and the elder brother used scattering salt in the air to describe the flying snow, which could be considered approximate. The younger sister changed it to wind-blown willow catkins, which was not only natural—unlike the forced invention of scattering salt in the air—but also showed that the situation was more similar. Once this line was uttered, it was feared that no one else could compete with it! Such an elegant line of poetry coming from a young girl's mouth made it even more praiseworthy!</p>
<h3>Song of Resistance Against the Enemy</h3>
<p>— Lu Er Yu</p>
<p>Do not be discouraged,</p>
<p>Nor be afraid,</p>
<p>Do not look back,</p>
<p>Even if thorns catch your blue shirt.</p>
<p>You must walk!</p>
<p>You must advance!</p>
<p>Your road is endless,</p>
<p>Your responsibility is inexhaustible.</p>
<p>Thousands of eyes are watching you,</p>
<p>Thousands of fingers are pointing at you.</p>
<p>They watch your success, your failure,</p>
<p>You must first strengthen your courage!</p>
<p>Children!</p>
<p>More foolish than the camels in the desert,</p>
<p>Yet they do not refuse the hardships of this life!</p>
<h3>A Proposal</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Junjie, Sixth Grade, Nanyang Elementary School</p>
<p>Children! The current national situation has reached the final juncture of life and death! Look, the enemy has forcibly seized our four northeastern provinces and still wants to annex the whole of China. If everyone reads the newspaper every day, then you know the extent of the danger in North China, so I won't go into detail. Recently, the enemy has instigated a group of puppet bandits and traitors to harass our Suiyuan: and used their planes and cannons to attack Suiyuan desperately. However, the generals and soldiers defending Suiyuan are all very brave in resisting them; they are not afraid of hunger and cold, not afraid of sacrifice, and are determined to fulfill their duty; their spirit is so admirable!</p>
<p>However, Suiyuan is not Suiyuan of the Suiyuan soldiers, nor is it Suiyuan of the Suiyuan people, but Suiyuan of all Chinese people. Therefore, everyone has the responsibility to defend the territory. We children should not lag behind in loving our country and should also contribute some effort to fulfill our responsibility. Therefore, I have a proposal: to save the money that everyone would spend on sweets and toys in the next few days, collect it, and send it to the Shenbao to be forwarded to the warriors fighting the enemy on the front lines to buy clothes and rice. On the one hand, everyone should work hard to raise clothes, money, and goods from all sides and send them to the warriors as encouragement. I think "many grains of sand form a pagoda, many foxes' armpits make a fur coat," at least it will provide some help to the many fighters who are fighting the enemy! I hope the children will work together to support this great cause!</p>
<h3>Why is it Cold on High Mountains?</h3>
<p>— Shi Jiu</p>
<p>Min'er came home from school, and as usual, his father asked him what he had learned today. Min'er replied, "Today in science class, Mr. Lu told us that the closer we are to the sun, the hotter it is; so if there were no sun in the sky, humans and all living things would freeze to death."</p>
<p>His father smiled and said, "Then aren't high mountains closer to the sun? Why is there year-round snow on the mountain tops that doesn't melt? Also, in the summer, why do rich people insist on going to the mountains to escape the heat?"</p>
<p>Min'er thought for a moment and replied, "I don't know about that, but Mr. Lu wouldn't be wrong."</p>
<p>His father said, "Not knowing is not knowing, you are right; but you say that Mr. Lu is never wrong, then seeking knowledge should not be so careless. Regardless of whether what others say is right or wrong, we should study it carefully."</p>
<p>Min'er said, "Then, did Mr. Lu say something wrong?"</p>
<p>His father said, "No, what he said is very right. But we should think more when seeking knowledge. If Daddy were you, I would ask Mr. Lu the two questions I just raised."</p>
<p>Min'er listened and was filled with regret. His father comforted him and said, "Why doesn't the snow on the mountain tops melt year-round? Mr. Lu probably didn't have time to explain this. Let me explain it to you."</p>
<p>"Mountain tops are indeed closer to the sun. But we must know that to maintain body temperature, we must wear clothes. Similarly, to maintain the sun's temperature and prevent it from dissipating, there must be something important to wrap it up; there is no doubt about that. And this thing is increasingly lacking the higher you go from the ground. What do you think this is?"</p>
<p>Min'er said, "Since this thing cannot be seen, could it be air?"</p>
<p>His father smiled and said, "That's right. This air is like a blanket, wrapping the earth to preserve the temperature; and not just one blanket, but countless blankets wrapped around it, to prevent sunlight from escaping elsewhere. So, we not only need sunlight to give us heat, but also, once we have heat, we must rely on this thing, the 'blanket,' to wrap it up so that we don't feel cold. The higher you go from the ground, the thinner the air. The thinner the air, the easier it is for sunlight to dissipate. The easier it is for sunlight to dissipate, which is why the snow on high mountains doesn't melt year-round, even though the mountain tops are closer to the sun. Understanding this principle, then why rich people flock to the mountains to escape the summer heat is also self-evident."</p>
<p>Min'er listened and suddenly understood.</p>
<h3>Starting from Eating Candied Chestnuts</h3>
<p>— De Lin</p>
<p>Yesterday, around dusk, after finishing work, I was walking home from my business when I passed a fruit store. Beside the pedestrian path, they were frying candied chestnuts, and they had written "Tianjin Liangxiang" in glass-framed letters. I bought a few bags, and they were still warm and almost too hot to hold. After I got home, my seven-year-old cousin, who had finished school, was visiting. I opened two bags, and we peeled and ate the chestnuts together. This made me think of imperialist Japan and the good influence it constantly gave children in their daily lives, whether at home or at school.</p>
<p>For example, when an elementary school teacher talks to elementary school students about how candied chestnuts are the most delicious thing, then he will tell them that candied chestnuts are produced in Liangxiang, Tianjin. If we can seize North China, then we can eat as many as we want. Or when talking about oranges, the teacher will say: The oranges from Fujian, China, are the sweetest, even better than those produced in America. If we take down Fujian, then we can eat oranges endlessly. When talking about peaches, they must also say how sweet the peaches from Fenghua, China, are. If we fight to Fenghua, China, we can enjoy them without end. From this point, we can see the importance that Japanese imperialism places on children's education. In every action and contact of children, and in their daily lives, they are constantly stirring up their patriotism and their interest in aggression, while also arousing their sense of responsibility to the nation. This is something we should pay attention to.</p>
<p>Because eating candied chestnuts made me think of the cultivation of children's daily lives by Japanese imperialism, but in China, we should also give children some enlightenment of patriotic thought. For example, when eating candied chestnuts, we can also tell them that Liangxiang, Tianjin, the place where candied chestnuts are produced, is about to be taken by the enemy. We should find a way to reclaim it. In this way, at least we can arouse their fragile little minds to understand how serious the national crisis is and how imperialist the aggression is, so that when they grow up and step into society, they can take on the responsibility of serving the country and recovering lost territories.</p>
<h3>Physical Little Knowledge</h3>

<p>Why do the bristles of a writing brush spread out in all directions in water and then gather into a bundle when taken out of the water?</p>
<p>When washing a writing brush, the bristles suddenly spread out in all directions, and then gather into a bundle when taken out of the water. Children! Do you have such questions when washing brushes? Originally, when the brush is in water, each molecule has an adhesive force with the brush, so it spreads out in all directions. When it leaves the water and faces outwards, because water has surface tension, it can make the brush gather into a bundle.</p>
<p>Why does a stick appear bent when inserted into water?</p>
<p>A stick appears bent when inserted into water. This is due to the refraction of light. Refraction occurs when light passes through two objects of different densities. When light enters the water from the air, it appears farther from the surface of the water than its actual path. Conversely, when it emerges from the water into the air, it appears closer to the surface of the water than its actual path, so it looks like it has been refracted.</p>
<p>Children! When you take a stick and insert it into a place with water, you can tell that what I am saying is true.</p>

<h3>Chrysanthemum</h3>
<p>— Wu Pinxian, Fifth Grade, Shanghai Zhiben Elementary School</p>
<p>In our school, there is a small garden. Inside the garden, there is a row of fences. Beside the fences, there are dozens of chrysanthemums. They have green and messy leaves, looking like a pile of messy green grass. In the garden, besides chrysanthemums, there are also many famous flowers. From spring to autumn, they bloom one after another. After class, the students all go to admire the famous flowers, and no one even glances at the chrysanthemums.</p>
<p>As autumn deepens, the chrysanthemums must develop their path of life. Although the cold northwest wind blows and thick frost covers them, the chrysanthemums are not overwhelmed by the wind and frost. They can actually invigorate their spirits and fight against the violent wind and frost. As a result, the wind and frost lose their violence, and the chrysanthemums bloom proudly.</p>
<p>At this time, the periwinkles, roses, and other flowers in the enclosure have either shed their flowers and leaves, or their branches and trunks are standing bare. Only the chrysanthemums beside the fences, blooming in red, white, yellow, purple, and all sorts of colors, are incomparably beautiful, and the students all come to admire the chrysanthemums.</p>
<p>I think: The chrysanthemum's results today come from fighting through the severe cold. Looking at our China, which is constantly being invaded by imperialism, we four hundred million compatriots must protect our country and ensure the survival of our nation. We should invigorate our spirits, work together with one heart, and point our guns at the outside. If our country wants to be powerful in the world, there is no other way but to resist and fight.</p>

<h3>The Talking Oil Lamp</h3>
<p>— Reply to Wang Ziqiang of Guangzhou</p>
<p>Dear Ziqiang,</p>
<p>We have received your letter. Your account of the camping situation in Shipai is very detailed and also very interesting. We are very willing to accept many of your suggestions for this mailbox. Within the realm of possibility, we are willing to do our best to improve.</p>
<p>The questions you have raised are indeed worthy of attention. When practicing light signals at night, you naturally have to use a flashlight. But it also has its drawbacks. First, it is uneconomical, and second, there is no way to use it once the battery is used up. After detailed discussion, we think there are some remedial methods, and we are going to tell you here a more practical method.</p>
<p>Don't you take tents with you when you go out camping? Also, don't you have lights on your bicycle team? This is a very good communication light. Kerosene can be bought anywhere, unlike batteries, which can only be bought in more prosperous places, and the price of kerosene is much cheaper than batteries! Therefore, we think that oil lamps can be used to replace them when practicing light signals.</p>
<p>You can take a few pieces of wood and nail them into a lidded wooden box. Dig a round hole in the front of the wooden box, and then nail a movable wooden board on the upper end of the hole, and engrave a handle on it. Then put the lighted oil lamp in the box, point the light at the hole, and close the box. This is done. You only need to move the handle up and down by hand, and the wooden board in front of the box will move up and down accordingly. Then, the longer the time the wooden board is lifted, the longer the time the light shines out, and the light will not be seen when the wooden board covers the hole. In this way, you can use the duration and number of exposures to represent various signs of telegraphy, and the other party will clearly receive the information you send.</p>
<p>Do you think our method can be used? Please, wish you progress!</p>

<h3>The Mourning of the Northeast Boy Scouts after the Completion of the National Boy Scout Review</h3>
<p>— Hong Fu transcription</p>
<p>The second national Boy Scout review has already closed on October 11! The Boy Scouts of each unit have certainly happily returned home! But our respectable and lovely Boy Scouts from the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe are very moved. Before the Boy Scouts from all over left the camp, they gave a very sad farewell on the camp's broadcasting station, reporting on the current situation of the children in the Northeast. Now I will introduce this valuable farewell to the children!</p>
<p>Dear children: You saw the Boy Scouts from the four northeastern provinces also came to participate in this national review and camping, and everyone felt very excited and expressed endless joy. When we first arrived at the camp, we judged that everyone's hearts were like this based on the various hints you gave us. Today, in the review field, everyone gave us an extraordinary welcome, which further confirmed that our prediction was correct. We cannot repay your sympathy and welcome, only shed a few tears, increase a few points of shared hatred, and increase a few points of self-confidence in the work of revitalizing the nation and recovering lost land. When the lost land is recovered, everyone will give us the same sympathy and assistance. We decided to keep the units of the four northeastern provinces in this great review and great camping. We received this news very late. Due to the limited time and the difficulty of preparation, very few people participated, which looked very deserted, adding a lot of sadness to everyone. We are very sorry for this, but after this review is over, we will continue to work hard and work harder to thank everyone for their warm welcome.</p>
<p>We have brought some news from the children living in the Northeast these days. I want to report to you. Everyone must be very willing to listen to it. What is their living situation like? ! ! The director of every school is a person of a certain country, and there are many more people of a certain country as teachers, and some schools even have principals who are from that country! ! ! In that kind of environment, not only can they not read the Three Principles of the People, they cannot read Chinese history, they cannot read Chinese geography, and even books related to the spirit of martial arts have become forbidden books! ! ! Of course, they have no chance to receive Boy Scout training or to participate in large reviews and camps. What do they do? ! ? Let me give you an example of a meeting! The first thing is to visit Yuying, which is to pay the highest respect to the pseudo-emperor Pu Ni. The second thing is to read the edict, which is the edict issued by the pseudo-emperor Pu Ni. The third thing is to sing the pseudo-national anthem. The fourth thing is to worship Gaocheng from afar, which is to pay homage to the place where the pseudo-emperor Pu Ni lives. Everyone, think about it, are they willing to do these things? ! Of course, they are unwilling, but in that kind of environment, they have to do it that way. How painful they are spiritually, and whether their life or property is guaranteed in the slightest. The pain in other aspects is even more difficult to express in words. Everyone heard this news, you must be more active and more sympathetic; or want to immediately save the children in the Northeast who are in deep water. Now I agree with everyone, and follow the instructions of the General Assembly, to intensify training and strive for self-cultivation in the various rules given to us, and under the guidance of the Chairman, to complete our mission. For the work of revitalizing the nation, we are willing to follow after you all and work together. For the work of recovering the lost land in the Northeast, we are willing to stand on the front line and fight to the death with the powerful forces. Finally, thank you all and wish you all health and unlimited prospects.</p>
<h3>Filial Piety (5)</h3>
<p>— Hai</p>
<p>Because the passport Basi Ke Fei carried stated that she was the daughter of an army colonel, she received a great deal of attention from lower-ranking officials along the way. The instances where she received favorable treatment were too numerous to count, while cases of rejection or neglect were relatively few. Later, she would say to people, "People always think that my long journey was very dangerous because they only heard me talk about various adventures, and didn't pay attention to the times I received preferential treatment."</p>
<p>There was one instance where she had a great fright. She knocked on many doors in a village, asking for lodging for the night, but was refused by everyone. However, an old man, after initially refusing her, suddenly ran up and called her back. She did not like his face very much, but she had no other choice and had to turn around and go with him. His wife had just as unpleasant a face. As soon as they entered the small house, they bolted the door with a thick iron bolt. A few pieces of oak were burning in a hole in the wall. Basi Ke Fei, in the faint light of the fire, saw that the old couple looked very troubled, and they immediately asked her where she came from.</p>
<p>Basi Ke Fei replied, "From Yiji Village. I'm going to St. Petersburg." The two of them asked, "Do you have a lot of money with you?" "Now I only have eighty copper kopeks left," Basi Ke Fei answered. She secretly rejoiced in her heart that she only had this little money left.</p>
<p>The old woman shouted, "That's a lie! People can't travel such a long distance without money."</p>
<p>Although she tried her best to explain that she really only had that much money, they still didn't believe her, which made her both frightened and angry, and she couldn't help but shed tears. Finally, they gave her a few sweet potatoes to eat and told her to lie down on a large brick stove, because the surface of the stove was very wide and flat. Poor Russians often used it as a bed. She took off her coat and put it aside, along with her purse and luggage bag, thinking that there was only a small amount of money in the purse, and that it would not lead to murder for money. She then prayed very sincerely and lay down. After a while, they thought she was asleep and began to whisper to each other.</p>
<p>"She must have more money, she must have banknotes."</p>
<p>The old woman quickly said, "I saw a chain around her neck with a small bag hanging on it, her money must be hidden there."</p>
<p>They lowered their voices even more and said, "No one saw her come to our house, no one knows she's still in this village."</p>
<p>Before long, Basi Ke Fei was shocked to see the old woman climbing onto the stove. She hurriedly explained that she really had no money and begged for her life, but the old woman did not answer, only pulled the bag from her neck, and felt all over her clothes, and took off her boots, and pried open her hands, while the old man held a lamp and shone it to the side; but after searching for a while, they saw that there was only a passport in the bag, and nothing else, so they left her and went to sleep.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Citizens Unite to Donate 100,000 Woolen Sweaters to Support Suiyuan!</h3>
<p>— Huang Shuwen</p>
<p>The citizens of Shanghai have always been enthusiastic in supporting and assisting the self-defense war to maintain the survival of the nation and the people. This has been fully demonstrated in the experiences of the Northeast Volunteer Army's resistance, etc. Recently, although foreign aggression has become more and more urgent, the patriotic sentiments of people from all walks of life have become increasingly high. Suiyuan is the first line of our national defense, no, it is the last line of our national defense, and it is the last barrier in the Central Plains of our country after the fall of the four northeastern provinces and the occurrence of the Hebei-Chahar issue. This Suiyuan defense war, which is related to the final survival of the country, has finally opened the prelude to the war after many days of brewing. Despite the friendly nations' declarations that it was a conflict between the Chinese regular army and local bandits, and despite the traitors' attempts to cover it up, saying that the bandits were not worth worrying about; discerning people all understand the background and intentions of the bandit-puppet invasion of Suiyuan, and are also wary of the importance of the gains and losses of the Suiyuan defense. Moreover, General Fu Zuoyi and the spirit of his subordinates' courageous resistance and the enthusiasm of loyalty to defend the country are no less than those of the past anti-enemy generals. No wonder that as soon as the war began, the "Aid Suiyuan Movement" in North China and other places sprang up like mushrooms, reaching its peak. The advocacy of Shanghai's various groups to organize the Suiyuan Army Support Association is naturally an urgent need. Curtailing food and using it to provide material assistance has already been advocated and begun, but the movement to donate cold clothes by reducing clothing has not yet been noticed. From the reports of those who went to the front to comfort the soldiers, we already know that the soldiers defending the border in the bitter cold of early winter need cold clothes the most, but I believe that buying clothes with donated money is not as economical and convenient as directly donating old clothes, and donating woolen sweaters among old clothes is the most suitable. My reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The sacrifice of donating old clothes is smaller than donating money, especially in the minds of the masses, they feel that this is a benevolent and inexpensive thing, so the results will be more enthusiastic and considerable.</p>
<p>(2) It is necessary to remit money to Suiyuan first, and then remit it to cities or inland to purchase military clothing, then the remittance fee and time have already suffered two losses.</p>
<p>(3) The cost of purchasing new cotton clothes is relatively large. In the current market where yarn and flowers are rising and there are shortages everywhere, whether there can be sufficient supply is still a question. Even if there is, the price controlled by foreign merchants will be even higher, so it is better to donate surplus old clothes, which is in line with economic principles.</p>
<p>(4) Donating clothes to the army is not like donating to refugees, where you can ignore the style and length, and only take warmth, and the army's clothing should be neat and light, in order to strengthen the military prestige and facilitate combat, so cotton robes and long clothes are not suitable, but woolen sweaters or woolen underwear can be worn inside the military uniform, which is more suitable.</p>
<p>(5) China's woolen industry is currently very developed, and its products are cheap and of good quality. When citizens replenish new clothes, they can promote industry and commerce. Furthermore, few women are engaged in production, and it is difficult to have surplus money to donate, so inspecting and sending old woolen sweaters and rushing to make new woolen sweaters will be one of the practical work of women saving the country.</p>
<p>As for the donation method, it should of course be initiated and planned by the "Suiyuan Army Support Association" organized by various circles, in order to achieve uniform and universal results. Now I would like to contribute some opinions based on the points that the author has thought of:</p>
<p>(1) The ideal method is to take the family as a unit, with each family donating at least one piece. Woolen sweaters are not as easy to remit or send in person as money, so after the date of announcement, the support association should send personnel to collect them door-to-door by truck.</p>
<p>(2) Before the collection, there should be about ten days of newspaper publicity and broadcast publicity to give citizens sufficient preparation: those who already have two or more pieces should check and store the older ones in advance, and those who only have one piece should immediately purchase and weave new clothes for replacement.</p>
<p>(3) The clothing collection personnel should bring formal receipts in advance, and a slip should be issued for each piece at any time. Only a name and house number need to be filled in. Prepare a stamp for "Shanghai Supporting Suiyuan Woolen Sweater" for each person and stamp it on the clothes on the spot to prove that the clothes will not be stolen, sold, or lost.</p>
<p>(4) If, during the first door-to-door solicitation, some people are willing to donate but cannot rush to make them in time, or have not seen the publicity beforehand, the clothing collection personnel should record the house number and collect the names of the places where donations have not been made after one week.</p>
<p>(5) The solicitation is mainly for woolen sweaters, and other short clothes that are suitable for military use can also be collected, but the word "Other" should be noted on the receipt to distinguish and facilitate statistics.</p>
<p>(6) In order to show credibility, it may be necessary to announce the results. The method is: put a piece of cloth on each lane, only fill in "Several pieces at No. 1 in this lane, several pieces at No. 2, ... Total number of pieces", etc., and the newspaper publishes the total results only in units of lanes, that is, several pieces in a certain lane on a certain road, without having to announce the official title, in order to save advertising space, and it is very convenient for citizens to check and compare. If there is any discrepancy, they can question and correct it at any time.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned methods are some points that I have thought of based on the special nature of donating clothes. As for the detailed methods, I hope that all circles will study and discuss them. Among them, there is a very obvious feature, that is, one receipt for each donated clothing item, unlike money receipts, which are more difficult to calculate and check, so it can reduce or prevent fraud and increase the faith of citizens. Also, old clothes are only for wearing, unlike money that can be used for other purposes, and stamping on the clothes can prevent theft, exchange, and loss. In the past, some citizens of Shanghai groundlessly suspected the use of donations to support Ma, which caused many enthusiastic groups and organizations that collected donations on behalf of others to suffer a lot of injustice. It can be seen that this method should be properly used to increase effectiveness.</p>
<p>If the above opinions are supported by all circles and put into practice, then calculating based on Shanghai's population of more than 3 million, with an average of one woolen sweater donated by five people per family, there should be as many as 600,000 pieces. Shanghai is originally a place where people value clothing regardless of wealth or poverty. Even if those who are too poor to afford woolen sweaters are excluded, at least 100,000 pieces is not a problem. These 100,000 woolen sweaters can immediately warm the hearts of 100,000 soldiers who are bitterly guarding the border, and at the same time save hundreds of thousands of dollars that should be used to purchase cotton clothes, which can be used to supply military equipment and provisions. The effect of this, whether in terms of enriching national defense strength or as a spiritual encouragement, cannot be measured in miles. The author hopes with all his heart that all circles of citizens in Shanghai, especially the women's circle, will unite to support and promote it, so as to add a great new force to the national defense support! (The manuscript fee will be transferred to the "Suiyuan Frontline Soldiers Comfort Money" sponsored by this newspaper.)</p>

<h3>Supporting Suiyuan and Aiding Spanish Women and Children</h3>
<p>— Ji Cong</p>
<p>The Spanish masses, for the sake of freedom and peace, have been fighting bloody battles for several months with the rebel army that colluded with foreign aggressors. During this period, the rebel leader, because he was willing to be a slave to Hitler and Mussolini, and willing to secretly offer his country's land and rights to the invading countries, obtained a large number of poisonous gases, aircraft, artillery, and various latest killing weapons from Germany and Italy to brutally kill the domestic people who protect the republic and love peace, and even ordinary women and children. People with a sense of justice all over the world are very angry about this situation; they have given the legitimate government and the masses of the people of Spain active assistance from all aspects, and some have even run to Madrid to participate in the frontline and fight hand-to-hand with the rebel army, making the invaders frightened! Because our country is far away from Spain, although there has been no active assistance to the resistance of the people of that country in the past, recently Ms. Soong Ching Ling and others have initiated the assistance to Spanish women and children, declaring and calling on women and compatriots across the country to provide assistance to the Spanish government and people, and hoping that our country's women will follow the spirit of Western women sacrificing for the country and unite to strive for national independence. This situation, as it is currently manifested, not only has not lost its timeliness in the slightest, but also has greater significance.</p>
<p>We are a weak and small nation that is being invaded and oppressed. All humans who are being invaded and oppressed in the world, as well as forces that sympathize with the oppressed, are our friendly forces; conversely, all invaders and oppressors are our enemies. Therefore, when any group of oppressed and invaded people in any part of the world is attacked, we should strive to help, just as the invaded people all over the world should help us when we encounter invasion: moreover, only when we and the friendly forces all over the world unite to help each other can everyone be liberated. The legitimate government of Spain and its freedom- and peace-loving masses have been cruelly attacked by the invading forces. If we do not actively provide assistance, the invaders will win, and the invading forces all over the world will inevitably expand greatly, making our liberation encounter greater difficulties. Now, the cruel war in Spain is at a critical juncture, and at the same time, our direct enemies are using force to seize our Suiyuan and North China. Objectively, our fate is the same as that of the people of the West, and everyone's current urgent task of resisting aggression and striving for independence and freedom is also the same; therefore, our current assistance to Spain is actually also assisting ourselves.</p>
<p>Now, the people of our country are actively supporting and assisting the heroic resistance of the Suiyuan soldiers; at the same time, there has been a warm expression of sympathy for the Spanish people's bloody battle with the invading forces: this fully proves that the eyes of the people of our country are still clear, the blood is still boiling, they can still recognize the current enemy, and they still have the greatest determination to actively resist the enemy. However, so far, our assistance to the Suiyuan anti-enemy soldiers is only monetary donations and spiritual encouragement, and we have not resolved to implement it by going to the frontline to fight with the soldiers there; and the current military force on the frontline is extremely limited, and the national military force has not yet prepared a general mobilization to deal with the enemy's new offensive; this is of course very insufficient. We know that the bandit army attacking Suiyuan is not an ordinary bandit, but a vanguard bought by the invaders. They have artillery, airplanes, and various new types of weapons, and the army and military supplies are constantly increasing, and the invading forces are mixed in with them; although my Suiyuan soldiers are brave, how can they resist such an invading force for a long time if they are not actively assisted by military force? It is really pitiful to say that we only see the enemy's planes bombing our positions in the newspaper, but we have not seen our own planes attacking the enemy. Where have our many planes gone! At the same time, there are still problems with the past anti-enemy strategy, that is, only trying to conserve, not to attack; this kind of resistance is tantamount to helping the enemy preserve its position and predetermining to offer the final victory to the enemy. In the future, we should completely reverse this method, and we should use the general mobilization of the whole country, with careful and complete preparation, with the greatest determination and courage, to attack section by section from Shangdu until we completely recover the lost land. Only in this way can we eliminate the invaders' ambition, obtain the thorough liberation of the Chinese nation, and achieve true peace in East Asia.</p>
<p>The liberation of the oppressed Chinese nation, and the loss of power by some of the invaders, will inevitably deal the greatest blow to the invading forces of the entire world, and the Spanish people and the world's masses who are being ravaged by the invading forces will also be easier to be liberated. Therefore, our national mobilization to resist the enemy by force is also to aid Spain and to aid the invaded and oppressed people of the world. Currently, aiding Suiyuan and Spain are both our major tasks.</p>

<h3>The World's Tallest Building</h3>
<p>— Junsheng</p>
<p>New York Correspondence</p>
<p>If you take a boat to New York, when the boat is about to reach this metropolis, look up and you can see a tall building that cannot be seen anywhere else in the world. It stands in the midst of all the large and small buildings in New York City, just like a Christmas candle standing among many fruits, displaying itself very specially. If you want to walk under it and look up, you will lose your hat, open your eyes wide, and break your neck, and it will be difficult to see its top floor clearly. This building is New York's tallest building, the Empire State Building.</p>
<p>The Eiffel Tower in Paris is the tallest tower in the world, with a height of nearly a thousand feet, which is certainly quite surprising. But the Empire State Building is three hundred feet taller than that tower! From the street to the top floor, it is one thousand two hundred and forty-eight feet high; if you are happy to calculate using Chinese feet, you will get an even more amazing number. It actually has eighty-six floors, but on top of that there is a two-hundred-foot-high tower from the eighty-seventh to the one hundred and second floors, where giant airships are moored in the air.</p>
<p>The fastest wind speed in the United States is one hundred and eighty-six miles per hour. A building as tall as the Empire State Building would be extremely dangerous if it were not well designed. On this point, Mr. Balkan, the consulting engineer of the construction company that built it, also paid special attention; he adopted a unique design and used a safe method to make such a large wind force helpless against such a tall building. It is worth mentioning here that the top of the building is equipped with a Gothic-style steel arch, on which there is equipment for tethering airships. In the evening, you can see a star-like red light flashing on the top of the tower tethering the airship, which is the identification mark for nighttime flight. At the same time, there are four pillars in the place where the airship is attacked, all made of steel; they all run through this building and deep into the ground thirty-three feet, standing on the foundation of the rock. Therefore, even if the tethered airship is blown by the wind, it will not have much impact on the overall building.</p>
<p>How much material does it take to consume such a tall building? We certainly have no way to estimate. However, according to the person in charge of the construction company that contracted to build it, there are 58,000 tons of iron alone; of which, the four central columns alone weigh 10 million pounds, or 5,000 tons. I'm afraid you haven't heard of this kind of situation.</p>
<p>The Empire State Building has sixty-two special express elevators, which automatically rise and fall and stop according to signals. Their speed is roughly one thousand two hundred feet per minute, so it only takes a little more than a minute to rush from the first floor to the top one hundred and second floor. It is said that the speed of the elevators here can exceed this, but because New York's laws limit the speed of elevators to a maximum of one thousand two hundred feet per minute, the elevators here can only be opened to this speed.</p>
<p>There is an observation deck on the eighty-sixth floor. If you want to climb this observation deck, you should change to another elevator on the eightieth floor; if you want to go to the place where the airship is tethered on the top, you must change machines from here. There is a room there that can accommodate fifty people, which is the highest house in New York, no, maybe the highest house in the world.</p>
<p>This spring, the elevator employees in New York City had a major strike, and many people living in tall buildings felt great difficulties; especially those noble women who wore high-heeled leather shoes that were two or three inches high, who had always walked less, and had never climbed high slopes, so when the agile elevator suddenly became a dead object, it was really like suffering extremely cruel torture for them to go up and down automatically in houses hundreds or even thousands of feet high! That situation made us believe that what Sinclair described in "The Peaceful World" was not entirely fantasy. (Note) At this time, the sixty-two elevators in New York's tallest building, more than 1,200 feet high, were also motionless. The gentlemen and wealthy people who usually lived in this highest house, overlooking New York, looking out over America, and eyeing the globe, could only stand helplessly on the lower floors of that building, looking up at the roof that reached into the clouds, and sighing in vain. However, there were some idle and curious people in the world who took this opportunity to climb this more than 1,000-foot-high building with a stopwatch. It is said that it was quite fun at the beginning, but when they reached the sixty-eighth floor, they had no energy to go up anymore: looking at their watch, more than three and a half hours had passed since they started climbing. At the same time, it was also said that at the beginning, they averaged one floor per minute, but later they gradually became tired. When they reached the ninetieth floor, they felt sore feet and aching waists, and they wanted to rest very much; as a result, they only went up to the sixty-eighth floor and retreated dejectedly.</p>
<p>According to statistics, the electricity required by the Empire State Building is 3,500 kilowatts, which is equivalent to the needs of a large city with a population of 400,000. If the iron used in it is gathered together, it can be cast into a double-track railway five hundred miles long between New York and Mendel. At the same time, the length of the electric wires and telephone wires used in it is 2 million feet, which can circle the earth twice. As for all the arrangements inside and the consumption of the masters living in it, it is even more difficult to count. However, on the streets of New York, and in the country of America, there are many unemployed people wandering around, and their families not only have no elevators and telephones, no beautiful furniture, but also no bread and daily necessities!</p>
<p>As for the owner of this building, it is the famous American politician Al Smith. He used to be the governor of New York and twice the Democratic presidential candidate. But in the 1928 American presidential election, he was defeated by the Republican Party, and since then he has left politics and entered the business world, joining hands with the American tycoon DuPont to buy the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, which is known as the boundary mark of New York, for 13.5 million US dollars, and then he worked hard to plan and build this world's first building.</p>
<p>Every day from 8:00 AM to midnight, this tallest building is open to the public; at the same time, a register is also prepared at the top for officials, dignitaries, and tycoons from all over the world to leave their names, and the owner of the building, Al Smith, is also very happy to receive these distinguished guests. As for the poor and lowly people, they are of course not destined to be associated with this building.</p>
<p>(Note) Sinclair's novel "The Peaceful World" once described the difficulties of noble women walking in dozens of floors high buildings during a workers' strike in imagination, which made people sigh and marvel. A Chinese translation of this work by "Zhao Zhao She" was available a few years ago, but it seems that it cannot be bought now.</p>

<h3>Research on Population in Chinese History</h3>
<p>— Hao Gu</p>
<p>When people mention China's population, they immediately say 400 million, but how many are there actually? Leaving aside historical populations, let's just talk about the present. The so-called 400 million is still an estimate from the Daoguang twenty-second year of the Qing Dynasty, and it was only a rough estimate by Westerners residing in China at the time. It definitely cannot be said to be an accurate statistic. Not to mention then, it is still the same now. Chinese government agencies and social scholars cannot give a definite figure on this issue. As for China's history, whether it is official history, unofficial history, popular novels, or historical anecdotes, all record the population figures of various dynasties and states, but it goes without saying that these are even further from the actual numbers. However, in our spare time from reading history, we collect them at any time, make a systematic summary, and analyze them. Although we cannot say that this will reveal the real changes in the population of past dynasties in China, it can at least prove the impact of turmoil and prosperity on population, and at the same time, it can provide some interesting material for those who specialize in the study of social history and economic history.</p>
<p>Since Malthus's "Essay on the Principle of Population" was published, everyone has regarded the law that population increases in geometric progression as an indisputable truth. They even attribute the struggles between groups of people, between countries, and between races, the development or stagnation of the economy, and the rise or fall of politics to the population principle. If this is the case, then the stagnation of the population and the failure to increase must be explained by the population itself, and the development and evolution of society must also be determined by the population law. But why has the population of various countries in the world increased dramatically in the last two centuries, while it has stagnated for thousands of years in ancient and medieval times? It can be seen that explaining population with population cannot yield an answer. The rapid population growth in modern Western Europe is due to the rapid development of production in Western Europe. The development of industry and commerce means that economic power is sufficient to support a larger population, and it also requires a large population to engage in production, so the population also increases. Conversely, in ancient and medieval times, the world's economy remained in a state of slave economy and feudal economy, with only scattered, small-scale, and slow production, so it could not support a large population, and therefore the population did not increase. It can be seen that the population problem is determined by the economy rather than the economy being determined by the population. With this basic principle in mind, we can study the population problem in Chinese history.</p>
<p>The books we are based on are mainly the "San Tong Kao," namely, the "Wenxian Tong Kao," the "Huangchao Tong Kao," and the "Xu Tong Kao." In addition, we also refer to the official histories of various dynasties, such as the "Shi Ji" and the "Han Shu." Furthermore, we are only studying to get an overview, so we especially highlight the population during the extremely important transitional periods of dynasties; as for population statistics for each dynasty and each year, they are too cumbersome and unimportant, and are mostly omitted. Finally, because the dynasties were not completely unified politically, we had to add up the simultaneous records of various states when compiling statistics, without considering the numbers of each state. There were also many times when many states lacked population statistics altogether. This can only be found in miscellaneous histories and the documents of political theorists at the time, but this is even more of a rough number. Moreover, the further back in time we go, the more inaccurate the numbers are, because we cannot have as much reference material to corroborate them as we do when studying modern times. Now, let's try to make a statistic based on the San Tong Kao:</p>
<p>In the era of Xia Yu, the number of households is unknown, but the population was said to be more than 13.5 million. In the early Zhou Dynasty, it was more than 13.7 million. The difference between the two dynasties is not large, but the Shang Dynasty between the two dynasties is nowhere to be found. When the Zhou Dynasty moved east, it was 11.9 million. The end of the Zhou Dynasty and the beginning of the Han Dynasty are both unknown. From the decrease in population when the Zhou Dynasty moved east, it can be seen that the chaos of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty and the invasion of the Quanrong were very related. Unfortunately, the "San Tong Kao" does not record the Warring States period, the Chu-Han contention, and the early Han Dynasty, but the general idea can be inferred from the documents of Su Qin and Zhang Yi lobbying the six states, although they are somewhat exaggerated. Su Qin said that Yan, Zhao, Han, and Qi all had hundreds of thousands of armored soldiers, and Chu had millions. Zhang Yi said that Qin had millions of soldiers. The number of soldiers at the time can also be verified by the number of chariots. Su Qin said that Qi, Chu, and Zhao each had 1,000 chariots; Yan had 600; Wei had 600 chariots and 5,000 riders; and Qin had 1,000 chariots and 10,000 riders. If each chariot and 10 riders were matched with 1,000 soldiers, then the total number of soldiers in the seven states would be 7 million. According to Su Qin, "Linzi has 70,000 households, with three men in each household, then Linzi can have 210,000 soldiers." Based on this, the population of the seven states should be more than 2 million households. If each household is counted as "eight people, then 20 million people can be obtained. But there are still many small states, such as Song, Wei, and Zhongshan, that have not been included, so the population of the Warring States period may have been 20 to 30 million. People often think that during the Warring States period, due to years of war, the population must have gradually decreased. But in fact, the primitive industrial and commercial economy was very developed at that time, as can be seen from Shang Yang's abolition of the well-field system and opening up the fields. At that time, the culture of the scholars was also very brilliant. The economic development created strong countries, and the population also increased compared to before. However, we must also note that the Chinese territory at this time was already larger than that of the Xia and Zhou dynasties.</p>
<p>If people who have studied social history know that in the early stages of slave society, because large numbers of slaves were used for production, not only agriculture was improved, but also primitive industry and commerce were greatly active. The Western Han Dynasty was a typical stage of slave society in Chinese history, and it was a period of prosperity for slave society. For example, the wealth of Emperor Wen and Emperor Jing of the Han Dynasty, and Deng Tong, who became a wealthy man by operating a tenth of the profits with favor. Because of economic development, the population number also increased greatly. At the end of the Western Han Dynasty, before Wang Mang, the number of households was more than 12 million, and the population was 60 million. Later, during the time of Emperor Guangwu of the Han Dynasty, the population suddenly decreased. According to historical facts, this era was an era of peasant rebellions. Liu Xiu (Emperor Guangwu) was also born as a peasant, and followed the vagrant proletarians in rebelling against the government. At that time, slave society had developed to the point of saturation and could no longer be progressive. The slave economic system had also become corrupt at this time, and it could not be remedied by itself, so the peasants were forced to rebel. At this time, the population also decreased sharply, with only more than 4.2 million households and a population of more than 20 million.</p>
<p>However, the resistance of slaves could not overthrow the political system of slave society, and they never had a way out. As a result of the rebellion, the rulers suppressed them and restored the original state. But at this time, the slave system was also on its last breath, half-paralyzed, and could no longer develop. Therefore, the population at that time could never exceed its prosperous period. At the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, there were more than 16 million households and a population of 50 million. The population was the smallest during the Three Kingdoms period, with only more than 7 million. But this is absolutely incorrect. Naturally, the social turmoil, such as the disturbance of the peasants (Yellow Turban rebels), and the wars between states had an impact, but it could never have dropped from the previous 50 million to more than 70 percent. However, from this drastic reduction, it can also be seen that the society at that time could no longer support itself as it was. If there was no external force involved, it would die on its own. Like the Roman Empire in Western Europe, in its later period, there would inevitably be invasions by foreign tribes to infiltrate its vitality, such as the Germanic people. China was the same. From the Western Jin Dynasty onwards, it was the Five Barbarians' Rebellion. Society changed as a result, from a slave society to another society (social historians in China do not have a consistent judgment on this society. Some say it was a feudal society, and some say it was a transitional society, the former like Wang Yichang, the latter like Tao Xisheng). From then until the Opium War of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, it was the same. Therefore, the population of the later dynasties, although there were increases and decreases, was roughly the same, and the feudal economy was only a small-scale peasant economy, which could not support the lives of many people. Now, let's list the population of the later dynasties as follows:</p>
<p>At the end of the Northern and Southern Dynasties, it was more than 11 million. During the peak of the Sui Dynasty, it was more than 46 million. It is unknown during the time of Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty, but there were only 8 million households. During the Tianbao years of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty, it was 52 million. During the time of Emperor Taizu of the Song Dynasty, it was 20 million. During the time of Emperor Gaozong of the Southern Song Dynasty, it was 19 million (excluding Jin), while the population of Jin was more than 20 million. At the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty, it was 58 million, and it is unknown at the end of the Yuan Dynasty. During the time of Emperor Chengzu of the Ming Dynasty, it was more than 66 million, and there was not much change after that. By the Qing Dynasty, the population decreased instead. In the eighteenth year of Shunzhi, it was 21 million, and in the fiftieth year of Kangxi, it was 24 million. But in the fourteenth year of Qianlong, it changed to 177 million, and by the forty-eighth year of Qianlong, it suddenly increased to 284 million.</p>
<p>It is thought that there were not many errors in the population after the Northern and Southern Dynasties and before the Qing Dynasty, and the relationship is also small. The population at the beginning of the Qing Dynasty must be inaccurate, and the population in the early years of Qianlong may be correct, but it suddenly increased to more than 100 million in just thirty years. Although this can be explained by the conquest of Xinjiang and the opening up of territory, it cannot be completely believed. However, in any case, we can also see that the social economy of China by the time of Qianlong had reached the beginning of the collapse of the feudal economy and the beginning of industrial capital economy. In addition, trade with overseas countries stimulated the development of domestic commerce, so it had the economic power to support a large population, and it also needed this large population.</p>
<p>In the last hundred years, the population has certainly been increasing day by day. If the four northeastern provinces and the frontier areas of Mongolia and Tibet are included, it may be no less than 400 million people. But in recent years, on the one hand, it has encountered the world economic panic. Capitalism has run into obstacles in the imperialist countries, not to mention our semi-colony, which is the end of its dumping. The economy has stagnated, and the population will also stagnate. What's more, it has been compounded by years of droughts and floods, as well as the encroachment of strong neighbors? So it is possible that the current population has decreased to 300 million.</p>

<h3>Japanese Capital's Advance into Eastern Hebei</h3>
<p>— Chen Shen</p>
<p>Hebei Tongxian Correspondence</p>
<p>(1) Preparations for the Eastern Hebei Bank</p>
<p>The Eastern Hebei Bank has been under discussion for a long time. The Japanese side originally planned to make it subordinate to the Bank of Korea, but then thought that the Bank of Korea's access to the economic situation in Hebei and Chahar was not yet possible, so it changed to rely on the Central Bank of Manchuria. They are also preparing for the establishment of a so-called "North China Central Bank," and the function of the Eastern Hebei Bank is a transitional bank in North China. However, at present, its activity ability is only limited to the Eastern Hebei war zone. Its capital is tentatively set at 500,000 yuan. It is said that it will definitely be established within the year.</p>
<p>(2) Kanebo Textile Company's Pulp Factory</p>
<p>"Kanebo" is a famous Japanese textile trust, and the Pulp factory here is directly under the Japanese "Xingzhong Company." Eastern Hebei produces a lot of reeds, and the Eastern Hebei puppet government provides absolute convenience, so they have already established a reed Pulp factory here, which is said to be very successful. In order to complete the consistent artificial silk industry ×× plan, there is also a so-called second decision plan, preparing to add artificial silk and processing factories. Now they have completed the investigation and are actively preparing.</p>
<p>(3) New Factory of Dongya Tobacco Company</p>
<p>Dongya Tobacco Company is also a large-scale Japanese tobacco company. They have decided to open a new factory in Qinhuangdao. The base of this factory has been purchased to 20,000 tsubo (one tsubo is equal to six square feet in our country), and 20 cigarette machines are planned to be installed. The factory will soon be formally established. It is said that the establishment of this factory was entrusted by the Eastern Hebei puppet government. It has obtained the Eastern Hebei tobacco monopoly, which goes without saying.</p>
<p>Now, Japanese small merchants are also paying close attention to the industry and commerce of Eastern Hebei. They have organized a large investigation team to conduct on-site investigations.</p>

<h3>Flea Circus and Live Head Chop</h3>
<p>— Lang Dejun</p>
<p>A flea, also known as a gnat, is a parasite that is smaller than a grain of rice, and specializes in parasitizing humans, cats, and dogs, and living by sucking blood. It is the most unwelcome thing. But in Shanghai, which has everything, there is a flea circus, which has attracted thousands of people to watch it. At the same time, in that place, there are also live head chops and live people in knife chop boxes and other large sets of magic. This is not surprising to those who have seen it, but if you have not seen it with your own eyes, it is worth talking about, right?</p>
<p>I am a person who wants to see everything new and strange. I can't help but want to see the great skills of the small parasites, so I went to the fourth floor of the Great New Company and spent two dimes on a ticket to visit. Walking inside, I saw a large square table surrounded by people, and the flea circus was starting. The square table was very large, eight feet long and six feet wide. In the center of the table, there was a white board, more than three feet long and about two feet wide. On both sides of this white board, there were many Fujian lacquer boxes inlaid with fish bones, some round, some rectangular, and some square. A flea conductor in his thirties, wearing only a white shirt and Western-style suit, rolled up his sleeves and exposed his wrists, sitting opposite the audience. While taking fleas out of the lacquer boxes to perform, he said to the audience, "The life of a flea is naturally very short, but I can keep it alive for a year. Now, I am offering a reward of 900 yuan. Whoever can keep a flea alive for two months can have this 500 yuan." Someone in the audience said, "It jumps away, where can you find it?" The flea keeper smiled again and said, "Please see! Fleas must be tied up to be raised!" As he spoke, he held a small pliers in his right hand, opened the lid of a lacquer box with his left hand, and clipped out the flea together with the hair-like thread that connected it, and held it up for everyone to see. Afraid that everyone could not see clearly, he also prepared a small microscope, which could actually be called a small magnifying glass, which could be held in the hand to look at. He fastened a flea behind the mirror and handed it to everyone to pass around. Sure enough, a lively flea was swinging there happily, as if waiting. While everyone was passing the flea around, he said to the audience, "Take a look, it's convenient for you, but it's not convenient for me to tie this thread. If it's too tight, the flea will be strangled to death; if it's too loose, it will run away in a while. I am a skilled flea tyer, and it takes me twenty minutes to tie one. Gentlemen, it may take you one or two hours to tie one? If you don't believe me, try it." But no one in the audience answered. After a pause, a spectator asked, "What does the flea eat?" The flea conductor said, "To tell you the truth, it simply eats me. Fleas eat my blood to live; I rely on them to perform to support myself. It eats me, and I eat it, half and half." Before he finished speaking, everyone burst into laughter, and the sound of laughter was endless. Then, without further ado, the flea show began. The flea conductor took out a small copper car from a larger box, but it was only half the size of a small matchbox. A small flea was tied to the shaft of the car, and he shouted "Oh, Go" with his finger pointing. Sure enough, the small flea walked forward step by step, and the car followed. At the same time, he also took out a copper road roller, which also walked like the car. Someone couldn't help but ask him in surprise, "Fleas can only jump, right? No one has ever seen it walk step by step! How do you train it?" The conductor said, "Please take a look!" While speaking, he took out a hanging object from a box that looked a bit like a hand-held incense burner. It was a small copper chain with a flea hanging on it. "Fleas can't be allowed to jump all the time. If they jump all the time, they will jump to their death in the Huangpu River. So I first have to get it used to walking. But how can I make it walk when it can only jump? So I came up with this way of hanging it. The chain is dozens of times heavier than it, so it wants to jump but can't. Also pay attention when hanging it, so that its feet can still touch the ground. Naturally, it will walk. The cars that the fleas dragged just now were each two thousand times heavier than the flea itself. After many tests, we know that fleas have a very strong load-bearing capacity. We have tested it: if we put a ball that is five hundred times heavier than it on its neck, it will carry it without any effort!" As he spoke, he took out a small ball and did the same for the audience to see. After a pause, he announced that he would teach the fleas to kick the ball. First, he took the ball off its neck and placed it on the flea's feet, teaching it to grab it with its feet. He also made a sound to teach it to kick it away. As long as he shouted, "Oh, Go!" The flea would kick the ball one or two feet away. After several tests, it obeyed the command respectfully. At this time, the conductor announced, "Everyone, the minds of each flea are very simple, so each can only do one trick. As soon as it hears my voice, it will do the same, but it is really the same, and it will never come up with new tricks." Then, he took out a small round piano, which looked like a round table. The flat, large tabletop was often used as a dance floor, and the piano underneath could make a dong dong sound. He used small pliers to clip out four or five more fleas, but each of these fleas was covered in a piece of clothing, which was a special conical funnel-shaped clothing. When the little fleas heard the sound of the music, they were just spinning around, like dancing the hula. After that, he took out a roulette frame, which was four inches square. He said, "There is a roulette in the middle that looks like a waterwheel, and its weight is about five thousand times that of a flea. Now, let a flea come to drag it." As he spoke, he took out a flea, placed it under the roulette in a slightly protruding place, and the conductor shouted "Oh, Go" – The following continues on the fifth edition.</p>

<p>sound, and the roulette turned. However, it was turning very weakly. After the roulette was finished, the flea show was over. Because people were crowding in front and behind, I heard someone shouting loudly in another place: "Gentlemen who have finished watching the flea show, please come here to see the live head chop." In this shout, a large group of people rushed to the place where the heads were being chopped like a tide. The setting there was very gloomy and terrible, like a execution ground during the French Revolution. A guillotine stood high, with a large chopper hanging high between two long wooden pillars. The magician who hosted the show even took the time to test the weight of the chopper falling in front of everyone. I saw him flick the button, and quickly with a "clatter" sound, the large knife fell down, shaking the wooden platform for a long time. After a while, a fairly modern young woman appeared before everyone's eyes, with a pointy chin and a very gentle face. After a command from the host, she walked behind the guillotine and put her head into a concave-shaped place to wait for execution. At this time, the host shouted loudly again: "Everyone, look carefully, you may as well stand closer! Watch us chop off this girl's head!" At this time, some timid people left without watching. I knew clearly that it was magic. No matter what trickery it used, it would never really kill anyone. So I squeezed to the front to watch. I saw the host press the same high-hanging chopper button that had been tested, and a large chopper fell suddenly, looking like it was really chopping off the woman's head. However, the woman's face did not change, and she was still as if nothing had happened. After that, the host took out a yellow cloth wrap, shook it open, and put it on the head, saying that he had put the head in here. Sure enough, in the blink of an eye, the head under the chopper disappeared. Because my purpose was to watch the flea show, and it was getting late, and people were squeezing too much, I left before everyone else dispersed. I gave up watching the set of people in the knife chop box.</p>
<p>Book Review</p>
<h3>Introducing "The Public Forum"</h3>
<p>— Zhao Yi</p>
<p>——Sold by Shanghai Shenzhou Guoguang Press, Price per copy: 1 Jiao——</p>
<p>"The Public Forum" is a recently published comprehensive bi-monthly magazine. Judging from this inaugural issue, its content is indeed relatively complex; it includes explanations of the international situation, research on Chinese issues, short commentaries, specialized treatises, and more. From the viewpoints of the various articles and their specific content, it can be said to be a publication worthy of reading.</p>
<p>The first article, serving as the inaugural address, is "The Recent Ten-Year Evolutionary Trend in the Chinese Publishing Industry" by the journal's editor, Wang Yucun. The author points out that "1926 was a watershed year in modern Chinese history," explaining that the great changes at that time "opened up a new path for the cultural and publishing circles" in China, enabling "China's emerging cultural ideas to establish a dominant position in the cultural and publishing circles." He then divides the changes in the Chinese publishing industry from 1926 to the present into three periods: the first period being the few years around 1926, the second period being around the "September 18th" Incident in 1931, and the present being the third period. He points out that the significant trends in each period are: "The first period mainly involved the translation and introduction of works on general progressive social sciences from around the world; the second period mainly involved the exploration and discussion of the history of Chinese social development; the third period mainly involves the clarification and popularization of the basic knowledge of the above two aspects." Such division and explanation may still require discussion, but at present, raising such questions and the author's expressed opinions are worthy of special attention, although the actual materials in the article are still lacking.</p>
<p>There are four articles explaining the international situation. The first is Qian Yishi's "The Eighteenth Anniversary of the World Armistice Commemoration." Although this is a timely commemorative article, we can see from it the new contradictions that have arisen in the post-war world, as well as the opposing situation between the "aggression front" and the "peace front" in the current international arena; it can be said to be a general and comprehensive analysis of the current international situation. The second is Peng Shumei's "International Struggle Revolving Around the Spanish Question." In this article, the author not only describes the current situation of the Spanish War but also explains the meaning of the non-intervention agreement, and further exposes the "true face of London's attitude towards the Spanish Civil War" from the perspective of Britain's own interests. The other two articles are Ji Zi's "A Perspective on Belgium's Restoration of Neutrality" and Shumei's "The Anti-Soviet Cooperation Between Italy and Germany." The former analyzes the significance and impact of Belgium's restoration of its neutral status from the perspective of its domestic and international situation, while the latter explains the recent plots of Germany and Italy and their threat to world peace.</p>
<p>In this issue of "The Public Forum," the articles that study Chinese issues are most worthy of mentioning. For example, Wang Yucun's "Imperialism and the Construction of China's National Economy" very practically explains, from the current situation of North China's economy, the encounters of China's textile industry, the significance of currency reform, the development of the transportation industry, and the relationship between imperialism and the sales of goods in China, the crisis of relying on the capital of aggressive countries to develop China's industry, breaking the dream of using imperialist capital to peacefully build the national economy. However, according to the author's opinion, one should naturally arrive at the conclusion that it is necessary for the Chinese nation to achieve liberation in order to independently develop our national economy, and that China's current problem is a national problem and a political problem, not a purely economic problem. Unfortunately, the author did not fully and clearly express this point, which can be said to be a slight flaw. Furthermore, Sun Huai-ren's "Soaring Grain Prices in a Year of Great Harvest" also points out, based on the actual situation, the two major reasons for the "soaring grain prices in a year of great harvest": concerns about currency inflation and large-scale absorption by foreign merchants, and explains its dangers. Finally, Gao Su-ming's "The Essence and Activities of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army" not only allows us to know the general struggle of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army but also allows us to understand the recent qualitative changes of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army; all those who care about China's national liberation should read this article.</p>
<p>"On Modern Youth" (Su Dan), which can be regarded as a special treatise, is also a rare essay. It is compiled and translated based on the works of the Japanese author Tosaka Jun, and it makes a profound study and explanation of the characteristics of modern youth and their various aspects. The author says: "With the evolution of the times, modern society is divided into two. The generation of youth in their prime is in one kind of society, and the youth of today are in another kind of society. Times are different, and the conditions of social life are different. In the past, youth only planned to wait for the time to come and smoothly become the successors of those in their prime, but now they are either eager to climb the social ladder of those in their prime due to the shadows of unemployment and poverty, or they harbor dissatisfaction with the established society in which those in their prime are located; these two trends cause sharp antagonism with those in their prime." This is the explanation for the de-youthification of many modern youths, which is the characteristic of the youth in the "era of conflict between father and son." Following this, it also makes a correct explanation of the relationship between modern youth and the general working masses and women, allowing us to know in what way they are similar in terms of being socially oppressed.</p>
<p>Guo Dali's "The Tomorrow of Chinese Culture" is a critique of Zhang Junli's "Theory of Free Culture." The author first explains the essence of Mr. Zhang's "Theory of Free Culture" from a social point of view; then, from the dialectical development of social culture, he criticizes the error of Mr. Zhang's compromising and timid method of establishing a new Chinese culture, saying that "new culture must be the negation of old culture," and that "thorough criticism is the only method for establishing a new culture, and conservatism will inevitably lead to the destruction of culture." These are all very correct views. However, regarding whether it is still possible for China to establish a capitalist culture at a time when the entire capitalism is declining, and regarding whose consciousness Zhang Junli's theory ultimately reflects, the author has not clearly expressed or fully explained, which prevents us from clearly understanding what the author's opinion is.</p>
<p>In addition, this issue of "The Public Forum" also contains short commentaries, domestic and foreign dispatches, literary and artistic treatises, and other writings, all of which are relatively readable.</p>
<p>Speaking of our hopes for the journal, there are also a few points: first, a comprehensive journal should have more complex and rich content so that readers can gain knowledge in many aspects; second, such a journal should have sufficient combativeness, and more polemical articles should be published, otherwise, it will become too mediocre; third, at a time when the problem of national liberation has become the most important problem, it should use great strength to awaken the Chinese people and work hard for the national salvation movement.</p>
<p>A Week of Travel</p>
<h3>A Day Trip to Saigon (Conclusion)</h3>
<p>— Ms. Ming</p>
<p>We sadly bid farewell to the Dean of Studies and took a tram straight to the zoo. The Saigon Zoo does not require admission tickets; anyone, rich or poor, noble or lowly, can freely enter. This park occupies two to three hundred acres and has all the tropical plants and animals. We left the country after the Mid-Autumn Festival when sweet osmanthus was fragrant, but here we saw lotus flowers in full bloom, admiring their reflections on the water. Unexpectedly, we spent two summers this year—The most numerous animals in the park are monkeys, with no less than eighty or ninety in a cage. This cage has no top, so these "ancestors of mankind" often manage to sneak out and run around the park, snatching food from tourists' hands. Besides monkeys, there are turtles. Speaking of the turtles here, some are as big as myths. Mr. Ye, who was traveling with me, is a bit nearsighted and plump. After walking around the park, he was tired and wanted to find a stone step to sit on. He searched around and saw a yellowish-brown stone block the size of a square table on the grass. He was overjoyed and ran to sit down, but before he reached it, the square table automatically and gracefully walked towards the pool. It turned out to be a large "turtle"—</p>
<p>After enjoying those exotic flowers and rare birds, fierce lions, and trained elephants, we strolled out of the back door of the park. It was about four o'clock in the afternoon, but the sunlight was still very strong. The back of the park was very quiet. Under the shade of those large trees, many Annamese natives were deeply asleep, their sleeping faces showing great comfort and leisure, as if they didn't think about anything other than getting a little comfort at this moment. Not far from the back door of the park, there is a primary school run by a Frenchman, which is exclusively for the children of the Annamese. All expenses are waived, and clothes and hats are also given, so there are many students. We did not go inside to visit, but only stood on the road and looked in through the window, and saw a young Annamese man holding a teaching whip and teaching a class of children about ten years old French. Of course, Annamese was still used for explanation, but the French he recited was truly fluent. When he saw our group staring at him, a proud look appeared on his face, as if saying: "Look, the French also value me——" We had already learned a vague outline of the Annamese youth from a French priest on the same ship. Those who have no money do not go to school and become literate, and work as cattle and horses all day for a living. Those who have money go to French schools, learn excellent French, and then go to France to study, but the French only allow them to study subjects such as chemistry and medicine, and do not allow them to study law, politics, economics, etc. After they complete their studies and return to their country, they are assigned to work as teachers, doctors, or pharmacists, etc.</p>
<p>The ship stopped in Saigon for four days. I only visited here for one day, and my heart was filled with depression. I did not go ashore for the remaining three days. In addition to reading, I stood alone at the bow, looking out at the panoramic view of Saigon—This paradise, known as the "Dreamland" of the East, is no longer a paradise for its native children and its close relatives, the Chinese!</p>
<p>Fragments of Brocade</p>
<p>— Wan Yu</p>
<p>A Latin poet said: "Whoever starts to do something has already succeeded halfway: on the contrary, whoever only does half of it is the same as not doing it at all."</p>
<p>"People should not be arrogant before the final goal is reached: if the goal has been reached, there is no need to be arrogant."</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw said: "Friends are the best, and can have long-term relationships; parents and siblings are not freely chosen, so they must be left."</p>
<p>An Arab poet said: "Heaven on earth is in the scriptures of the sages, on horseback, and on women's breasts."</p>

<h3>Sichuan Cuisine and Sichuan Opera (1)</h3>
<p>— Yao Chensha</p>
<p>Speaking of Sichuan cuisine, some people's tongues start to itch. Indeed, one of the main characteristics of Sichuan cuisine is that spicy taste that inexplicably stimulates people's taste organs. If you absolutely prohibit Sichuan chefs from using spicy flavors, no matter how skilled they are, many dishes cannot be made well. As for Sichuan opera, it has only recently been moved out from the distant thousands of miles away, from inside the [unclear] gate; its main characteristic, apart from the aspects of theatrical performance, is the use of gongs and drums, which are especially noisy and shocking to people's eardrums when they are played, and can also be said to be very stimulating. If it is said that Sichuan people's temperament is active rather than quiet, strong rather than gentle, and combative rather than willing to be humiliated, then in terms of Sichuan cuisine and Sichuan opera, we can probably get some explanation for the character of Sichuan people.</p>
<p>Judging from the recent situation, Sichuan cuisine seems to be developing more and more. Look, isn't the originally very quiet Huagene Road very lively now? When you walk along this road at lunchtime or dinnertime, you can see nearly ten consecutive Sichuan restaurants, all with many people eating or feasting there. Although we still don't know the actual business situation of those restaurants, it is quite remarkable that so many restaurants of the same nature have appeared in one place within a short period of time, and that so many people actually go to patronize them. As for Sichuan opera? We know that it once opened at the Xinguang Grand Theatre, but it soon stopped: now it has come back again, performing upstairs in the Dahua Ballroom, and it is said that it can still sell tickets, but no matter what, compared to the development of Sichuan cuisine, it is somewhat inferior. What is the reason for this? Everyone who knows Sichuan cuisine and Sichuan opera will have this question. I think the first thing to pay attention to is the so-called "stimulation" problem.
