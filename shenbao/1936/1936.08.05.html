<h3>斡旋桂局之可能性</h3>
<p>— 高</p>
<p>自陳濟棠免職走港。余漢謀旋斾返廣。粤事隱然告一段落。惟桂之李白。猶復延不拜命。吾人以驚弓之餘悸。怵魯難之未已。周匝旁皇。常難釋然。迨中央明令調李入京。以白主浙。而令黃紹雄負綏靖桂省之責。一時空氣。乃復趨於緊張。掀豗之說。甚囂塵上。桂軍出動窺欽廉矣。粤艦奉令開西江矣。英美各艦駛梧護僑矣。桂將成立自治政府矣。風聲所播。一若亂事之終難倖免者。循今日之世局。豈鬩牆之時會。此理至顯。上下共曉。自非別具肺腸。寗甘自居釁首。然而數月來吾人所曉音瘏口於和平之呼籲。勞精敝神於統一之祈求者。結果仍不免有如斯不祥之局面。人事至此。尙復奚言。</p>
<p>雖然。據近頃之消息以觀。斡旋當前危機。似猶未至絕望。駐梧桂軍。旣已開始後撤。所謂自治政府。迄未見諸實現。而蔣委員長致電李白。勸其接受新職。詞旨慨切。剖析詳盡。允足以證此陰霾混沌之局面。終不難獲澄淸明朗之一日也。蓋此次變卦之所由興。其根本癥結點。厥在於李白拜命電文之到達。適與中央頒發新令相差池。由是而積嫌成疑。寖生猜忌。在李白認中央別有作用。在中央謂李白蓄意抗命。毫釐之失。謬以千里。事之扼腕。寗有逾斯。吾人根據蔣委員長之東電。恍然於中央之所以變更前令者。實為顧全李百現實之困難。故欲另闢轉圜之途徑。至李白旣擬定期就任於先。何難接受新職於後。一切糾紛之搆成。無非意氣相激盪。此事旣經解釋明白。則所謂增防築壘紛調隊伍云者。豈非等於庸人之自擾。而事實上儘有不值識者一哂者乎。</p>
<p>平心而論。以李白之治桂成績。昭昭在人耳目。浙省號為勝區。極盼賢才敷政。此次中央調白長浙。其為因地施宜。藉展宏效。固亦意計中應有之舉措。而在李白卒不免於遲迥狐疑者。則平日過分隔閡有以致之也。常人一有誤會。寖且釀成不測。矧在膺地方之寄者。寗容作孤注之一擲。消除泯釋之道。端在開誠布公。互掬肺腑。觀於蔣電措辭之誠摯。宜足以歆對方之視聽。並聞蔣將躬赴粵中一行。俾與李白晤言一堂。盡情商酌。此則更為披荆斬棘探驪獨得之見。化干戈為玉帛。奠統一之局面。胥將於蔣氏此行覘之矣。</p>

<h3>肅軍異動和政變（三）</h3>
<p>— 家禾</p>
<p>過去的歷史告訴宇垣，欲實現他數年來的夙願，須掃除阻擋他的進展的障碍物，也就是須肅淸荒木派。寺內陸相，負收拾「二·二六」的衆望，勇敢地把荒木，眞崎，本莊和川島四大將編入預備役，又用陸相限於現役大中將的法令，使上述四大將，斷絕了東山再起之念。此後他每决所發表的異動的名單，都使財閥鼓掌：（一）三月二十三日的異動，用「負担政變責任」的名義，安挿他的同志，古莊幹郞的陸軍次官，讓給梅津美治郞，暫屈居於航空本部付，杉山元中將則避攻擊的目標，調任為參謀本部付，讓參謀决長于中派西尾壽造（關東軍參謀長）至于參加政變部隊的長官，如佐藤正三郞少將等，均受「待命」（卽免職）的處分。荒木派當日可稱為得意的，只有岡村寧决，由參謀本部第二部長轉任第二師團長。（二）三月二十八日的異動，係完成前决未了的工作。他把參加部隊的直轄長官，屬於聯隊長級的如步兵弟一聯隊長小藤惠大佐，步兵第三聯隊長澁谷三郞大佐，近衛步兵第三聯隊長園山光藏大佐等十一名免職，其他所更動百二十名的人員，也屬於佐尉官。（三）七月十日的異動，將前述待命的人員，一律編人預備役，政變時的東京警備司令官香推浩平中將（四月二日免職）也遭同一的待遇，雖然有接近林陸相的橋本虎之助（前近衛師團長）和崛丈夫（前第）師團長），作個陪襯，而荒木派的根據地，第一及近衛二師團，幾乎有斬草除根之勢。</p>
<p>同時，「八月異動的範圍相當之大」的消息，又顯現於新聞的上面。果然，轉補以及免職的人數達三千餘名之多，中間最重要的有林陸相時肅軍主角前面說過的杉山元，除榮任為軍事參議官外，另代替西義一（編入預備役）陞為陸軍三長官之一的敎育總監。雖然岸本綾夫中將，先他一脚進了大將級（但同時免職），而每個評論家，都對杉山氏，預約着大將榮進的期日。其决，稍屈一時的古莊幹郞中將，轉任陸軍航空本部長，原任航空本部的畑俊六調任為台灣軍司令官，兵器本廠附曾繼永田之後，活動于人事舞台的今井淸則出任第四師團長。以上的彈冠相慶者，都是被人們目為宇垣系或準宇垣系的人物。由他，我們知道今日日本陸軍的中央舞台，大半是受宇垣的支配。</p>
<p>另一方面我們來看荒木的陣容！今井淸的第四師團長，本來是建川美次的。建川中將，與在鄉軍人會長鈴木莊六大將同是騎兵科大先輩森岡正之少將的女婿，滿州事變後，他時與荒木作共鳴的演說，用這樣的人物，坐鎭日本「經濟的心臟」，關西財閥的都城——大阪，誰也知道是不適合的。現在他和少畑敏四郞中將同時編入預備役。另一個，我們要說的，是台灣軍司令官柳川平助。他對于荒木的交情，由長女和子的媒妁小事，也要煩勞大將兼男爵閣下，可以證明確是不凡。固然私情是一事，公誼又是一事，兩者不可相混，而荒木的得意理論家伊達龍城却把柳川中將列入荒木的陣襄，當南進聲　高唱天雲的今日，他被召回中央（任參謀本部附），這可以給我們說明，「肅軍」的工作，已由中央伸手到殖民地，如果殖民地的「肅軍」，是最困難的，那末，柳川的更調算是第一次的信號，也未可知。</p>
<p>研究日本軍部的編制和權力，是十分有趣的。在中央集權那樣鞏固的國家，權力操之于中央機關？不成問題。然而，如大阪那樣的地方，以及滿州和台灣的殖民地駐軍，却也佔着重要的位置。有的由地方召回中央增加了他的權力，有的由中央而轉出，却削弱他的力量，這可用大家熟悉的前上海武官影佐禎昭中佐，作為我們的說明。當他榮轉之日，以「滿蒙班長」的資格，在部內推動少壯派的政策，現在轉袖為駐仙台的野砲兵第二聯隊附，却與我們以明陞暗降的感覺。</p>
<p>按照上面的事實，「肅軍」的工作，確相當地可告一段落。「庶政一新」呢？由廣田內閣的設施，實給人以莫大的失望。因此，六月二日寺內陸相公開的宣言：「軍部之肅正與一般庶政之刷新，有相當的關係，不能切離」。（讀賣三日），這無異對廣由與以當頭一棒，七月二十六早，他（寺內大將）西下參拜伊勢神宮，更坦白地對新聞界發表了不滿現內閣的談話，以「國務大臣」的資格，說：「庶政一新旣是時代的要望，不能實行的大臣，應該無需躊躇地辭職，剩留有魄力的大臣，至于我自己或許屬於柔弱的人也未可知」。（大每），這是不是暗示要用辭職手段來倒閣呢？午後常他抵達名古屋時，答道「不會那麽簡單地辭職」（同上）</p>

<h3>日本旅行記（十一）</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　胡仲持　胡一臧</p>
<p>在編輯局參觀的時候，工作中的神尾君放下了筆走過來對我們招呼。他陪了我們進編輯局長室。這一間和廣廳相通，四角擺着幾張辦公檯，中央一張橢圓形的大桌子，周圍是許多椅子，朝日社的幹部人員就常在那里討論編輯的方針。</p>
<p>神尾君介紹了我們跟編輯局長原田讓三會見，我們便在那張大桌旁邊坐下來，一面吃着冰果子，一面跟原田局長談話。這位濃眉短鬚的和藹的長者，在他那懇摯的態度和博雅的談吐上很引得起我們的敬佩來。我們就新聞的編輯技術向他請教了一番。在得到各種有益的指示以外還承他惠贈他所著的「新聞之話」。他也許因為我們姓胡的緣故吧，問起我國的胡適博士。我們很慚愧，在新聞界混了這麼多年，至今還沒有認識這一位新文學啟蒙時代的大師。從原田這一問，我們不由得想到胡博士至少在外國人心目中，還是中國新時代智識階級的代表人物。因此我們不能不要求他把他的政治主張發表得更愼重些。看到他近來所發表的文章，他似乎已經把他原來的不很妥當的政治思想修正了，這是比較地可以欣慰的。</p>
<p>我們和原出局長正在談話的時候，朝日社長上野精一，董事會長村山善舉和主筆高原操從邊門走進編輯局長室來。神尾君一一的給我們介紹了一下。上野和村山這兩位朝日社的大老板都穿着黑色的禮服，顯出他們很高的身分來。上野社長現年五十一歲，因為髮頂微禿的緣故，看去比他眞實的年紀蒼老些。他那笑嘻嘻的微紅的棗型臉上的表情顯得他不但是一位英明的事業家，還是出色的政治家。村山和高原都蓄着短鬚，看去比上野年寄些。我們和幾位朝日王國的要人寒喧了一番。在寒暄中間，村山和我們作了如下的問答。</p>
<p>「如果現在我到貴國去，貴國人可會眞心地歡迎找？」</p>
<p>「先生到敝國去，我們新聞界一定是竭誠地歡迎先生的。但是如果先生的意思是要試探試探整個民族的感情吧。現在去似乎還早些」。</p>
<p>「那麽說來，這樣的時候是不會有的了。」</p>
<p>過後，我們向神尾問到朝日的歷史，據他說，大阪朝日新聞是明治十二年（一八八九）村山龍平所創辦的，起初日出一張，規模極小，明治十四年到得了上野理一經濟上的幫助，在兩人共同經營之下，篇幅加多銷路也就大增，明治二十一年又收買了東京目醒新聞，改組為東京朝日新聞。于是營業愈加發展，終于有二百餘萬（大朝東朝合計）的銷數了。上野理一和村山龍平就是現在社長和董事會長的父親。他們兩人的銅像豎在編輯局外面的樓梯上首。神尾君陪了我們到那里去瞻仰了一番。于是我們向聚在編輯局長室的各位主人告了辭，再四謝絕了神尾君的的宴，走出朝日王國來。</p>

<h3>挽回漏巵　國人建廠自製汽車　總廠設湖南株州分廠設滬　兩年以內每月可製一百輛</h3>
<p>中央社云、我國年來因公路建設努力之結果、陸地交通頻繁、惟其駛行之汽車、向由各國輸入、每年漏巵甚鉅，國內實業家、有鑒於此、發起創設中國汽車製造廠、已着手籌備、期於五年內自造一切機件、以廉價之出品、供給國人、此為我國新興之工業、當為國人所樂聞者、茲經記者探得其創辦計劃如下、</p>
<p>每年漏巵數可驚人</p>
<p>汽車輸入我國、雖僅三數十年，而最近十餘年間、增加允多、在上海南京廣州等大都市、私人之汽車、亦年有增加、自各省公路之積極建築、於二十三年底、已經通車者、達九萬二千五百餘公里、而在計劃及建築中者、尙有六萬八千餘公里、因公路交通、逐漸發展、行駛於公路上、之公共汽車、運輸汽車等、亦增加甚速、同年底國內各地行駛之汽車達五萬餘輛、上海市竟佔總數三分之一、且年來各國汽車出品之日新月異、競向我國推銷、我金錢之外流、數可驚人、</p>
<p>自建廠址　年內竣工</p>
<p>各國之汽車、係用汽油發動、其售價頗高、普通客車、恒在數千元以上、至其所用汽油日常消耗、尙不計算在內、蓋我國向不產汽油、均須仰給於英美俄等國、國內實業家、有鑒於此、故發起創設中國汽車、製造公司、資本規定為六百萬元，已經認足、設籌備處於本埠博物院路、其總廠設於湖南之株州、並設分廠於上海、已在半淞　路勘定廠址、從事興建、年內卽可竣工、至機件則向德國訂購、</p>
<p>第五年後完全自造</p>
<p>據該公司負責人談、該廠專造公共汽車及運輸汽車、而用柴油或植物油為發動力、其消耗油料之價格、僅及汽油三分之一、製造方面、因國內缺乏此種工程師、故與德國朋馳Benz汽車公司商定、請派工程師數人協助指導、而在開工之兩年內、其馬達及鋼料等、將由該國供給、而至第五年時、則馬達等均可自造、計算其售價、較舶來品的廉數成、而出品數量、在最初兩年內、為每月一百輛、以後觀營業之情形、於他處增設分廠、則當增加產量云、</p>

<p>現棉消費平庸、惟新花時有做開、屬　較　紗布交易所標紗存賬數量、至八月三日截止、査八月期成交八萬一千一百包、九月期十一萬六千八百包、十月期十二萬六千六百包、十一月期十萬零二千七百包、十二月期八萬六千八百五十包、一月期九千二百五十包、統計五十二萬三千三百包、比七月十三日之七十六萬一千三百五十包、大减二十三萬八千零五十包、茲將其中買賣最鉅之戶額、摘錄如下、（單位包）</p>
<h3>美棉私家估計增加不少</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、因私家估計相差甚巨、買戶束手、市况平靜、各月由不動至跌三磅音、旋以華爾街多頭了結、棉農套賣、市價下落、同業仍為最佳之買主、現貨市塲暗淡而堅、紐約棉花交易所估計全世界美棉滾存、截至八月一日止、為七、一〇六、〇〇〇包、去年為九、〇四一、〇〇〇包、前年為一〇、七〇一、〇〇〇包、收盤前空戶抵補、一部份回上、計現貨跌六磅音、期貨跌三至六磅音、英印棉停市、原電錄左、三（日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、四日開盤預測、七八月期白羅溪為二百二十八羅比半、跌〇·二五羅比、四五月期白羅溪為二百十六羅比半、與前日同、十二正月期奧姆辣為一百九十八羅比、與前日同、</p>
<p>美棉私家估計三日紐的電、番却爾公佈處本屆估計、生產百分數為七〇·四、產額為一一、九五一、〇〇〇包、較上决（七月一日）增五四〇、〇〇〇包、</p>
<p>三品紗花回小四日大阪電、三品期紗跌四角至一元、近月為二百十元、遠月為二百零三元、期棉跌一角至六角、近月為六十八元四角、遠月為六十四元三角、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋麥連漲不已　期現麥喊高五六分</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份一致呈良好之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥績好一二角、坎拿大漲一元一角至一元三角、當開價後、市塲人心均感於洋麥連漲不已、未免出於意外、故各月份開價師暗提三四分、以後開價、因買氣仍暢、又升一二分、幸得遠地客戶、及本街行家、均有實貨套賣、市面尙得抑平、否則逐步飛騰、亦不足為奇也、現麥市面、日來到貨較稀、已到之貨、客戶心思甚堅、不肯輕脫、故各檔喊價、又提漲五分、申廠做開特高貨吃至四元六角七分、决至五角半至四角半不等、至日商去胃、聞仍見貪、惟以船期已軋至二十二日以後、故行家亦不願預拋、至吃價仍較申廠大五分、照此情形、如出口未禁止、不免發生變化云、</p>
<h3>麵粉交易為限價阻滯　除本月份外其餘形同停頓</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤、除本月份交易尙未見活絡外、其餘月份、半入停頓、良以本月份因籌碼較多、最近粉銷去化、尙未緊軋、故盤旋於二分及一分七釐半之間、九月份以下、均為限價所阻、買賣均難活動、故交易甚少、微聞遠期空戶、急求了結、又有暗盤、十一月份傳二分、十二月份傳二分半、但雙方均為自行接洽、殊非正式云、</p>
<h3>客秈新貨到頭不絕</h3>
<p>昨客秈到頭不絕、新貸亦有續到、而去胃稍綏、市面暫轉定局、良以市價連漲三四天後、貨主均不願擯守、而客帮辦胃亦不似日前之貪、故暫得居平、惟各帮均有應酬、後市仍在看好中、昨日去化以本街較活、四川內地寗波粵帮均有應酬、全日開出江西米二千四百四十八包、湘米一千五百包、漢糙一百七十六包、江北糙三百包、價與前市相近云、</p>
<h3>食米漲跌互見</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源共到十四五號、貨共近三千石、惟本街銷塲轉呆、包胃亦仍不動、致市况呈定中帶軟之局、厚早粳疲勢、薄稻行情已修幾分至近角、杜洋尖亦疲、陰變元堅挺、東新僅北市到十二石、價則仍守老盤、</p>
<p>（滬北五昨日河下各貨到埠八九號、市銷方面早市略有問津、後市轉呆、市價白粳上市喊緊角餘、後市回疲近角、羊尖高貨價加二角、中决稍緊、杜尖定勢、客尖見疲、薄稻價挺立、變陰元價挺秀、東新粳又到十二石、價仍開十元零八角、</p>
<h3>油市　標準豆油大跌小回</h3>
<p>標油因前日在落、市上人心、惶恐不安、繼因大連一度來電回漲、人心轉定、而空頭因已占利、亦擬趁小收補、市乃逐步轉機、收價比之前市各好三五角、但速市尙無佳望、業中人心多半未有樂觀、故昨日回漲實為大跌小回之象、</p>
<h3>海味　海參正患新陳不接</h3>
<p>海參一物、來自東西兩洋、進口總額、據業此者云、最旺時的有四五萬担、估値五六百萬元自海關加徵入口稅以來、成本旣須劃高、而外洋生產、亦較前大减、核查近三年之進口總數、尙不及先前之半數、惟各色貨價、則飛騰上漲、現在各地新貨、正在開始捕捉、收獲豐歉、尙無目眉、而本市行號、所存陳貨、均已不多、致各檔花色、殘缺不齊、遇有客帮需要、常感少貨、際壯新陳不接之秋、故各貨市况、益見緊俏、</p>
<h3>糖市　國產糖直上靑雲</h3>
<p>昨糖市如粗砂白等趨勢依然平軟、公會劃盤二四粗砂白現貨呌二十一元八角半、轉口貨六元九角至八角、荷赤八號、OL嘜白包十六元一角、東白四八九號均呌原價、惟N喀轉口貨小五分、為六元四角、本廠綿白亦無更動、國產糖則漲勢未衰、有直上靑雲之概、如綿赤又升四五角之譜、開出五百數十包、計富昌抬至十六元、福全進峰十五元六角、麒麟靑　松發龍興濬記泉合儀記廣成等牌十五元五角至四角、决至十五元一角、潮靑因產價又漲、號盤高提靑竟喊十五元、期貨荷粗白有大昌洋行拋兌八九月裝輪二千包、價為荷幣二元九角、比前又小數分、故洋糖市勢有暫　振作之象、</p>
<h3>南北貨　明光新瓜子已有到滬　蜜棗步跌…金山枝稍見回好</h3>
<p>新蜜棗　嘉興蜜、自出新以來、連日到貨雖未見多、但市價逐步回落、査首市禿禿為四十二元、昨初開三十八元、後開三十六元、前後跌去六元之多、</p>
<p>糯米枝　近因到貨漸增、而號盤亦見鬆動、故行盤前後已降十餘元、昨市售八十元、惟各行頗有競爭、未能一致、漸趨紊亂、聞其間尙有數元上落、金山枝自步跌以來、無論客貨及自辦貨莫不均須虧耗、但據昨市形勢，因前後降度過甚、已稍見回好、後市如身份干燥之貨、似有轉升希望、</p>
<p>新瓜子　明光新瓜子、昨已有數件運到、又臨淮關子亦有少數告抵、今日當可開出、</p>
<h3>絲茶　華洋絲價相距太遠</h3>
<p>昨日海外絲價、美漲日跌、而市氣仍一致沉悶、國外絲價與滬埠持價、相距無五十元、絲經外銷、一時頗難接近、昨美國日絲八三勻度漲六分、日絲七五度、維持原價、上海絲七八勻度漲四分、廣東絲無漲跌、紐約現貨售開一·七〇元、與上週六市價相同、期貨微漲半分、橫濱現貨跌十元、期貨跌三元、里昂倫敦因歐局不靖、故市况杲鈍、昨本埠外銷寂寞、內銷亦僅有零星交易、</p>
<p>蝦目珠茶銷路尙暢</p>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市、路莊土莊兩路之蝦目珠茶、銷路尙不寂寞、其中身骨緊結之貨、頂盤開出一百十元、但低莊决貨、市盤回縮至五十元、市面頗呈提高抑低景象、惟珍眉綠茶、因非洲摩洛哥間大局未臻平靜市况仍在沉悶中、紅茶銷路、尙不十分呆滯、昨市怡和錦隆等行、繼續補進宜昌祁門紅茶六百餘箱、價均穩定云、</p>
<p>又據茶業公會報告云、昨茶市依然呆滯、交易非常零落、僅小針眉錦隆天裕各的有二百箱辦入、價十六至二十四元、較前見跌三四元、珍眉協和有高莊　珍四十件、盤價八十四元、其他如抽芯塲上亦有一二色售出、至兩湖茶據漢上來信云、該處到茶共的十二萬五千箱售出八千五百箱、裝運來滬者計三千五百箱、以三十一至三十五元售與怡和、市面非常惡劣、而昨報載英銷暢達、有巨額售出者尙非事實也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布市面已見呆頓</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市面、因標紗花下挫、兼以邇來各路實銷岑寂、雖現貨缺乏、市盤擯持不動、東疋白貨已微跌每疋二分半、各地已進各貨走銷不佳、市盤亦難與申市　合、致添辦生意、若斷若續、印染廠坯布印花發染需現貨仍急、各廠逐日有大批藍布，元斜、直貢、嗶嘰、花絨等、各帮客戶定貨交解報裝頗煩、惟後添生意已形寥寥、售盤亦難以提升、客帮以川滇粵去勢稍佳、成交花素嗶嘰直貢縐呢細布細斜藍布元斜等貨二百餘件、漢口長沙帮細布細斜及小數直貢嗶嘰縐呢等貨二百餘件、及本埠批發莊進本廠細斜百餘件、染色斜客帮亦有自辦細斜發染昨蕪湖安慶福建等帮、亦辦五六十件、　　市價</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （張鳳）</p>
<p>有家者厭家，無家者慕家，正似有親者厭親，無親者慕親，具有相同的心理。</p>
<p>有家的人很多認這家是一個累　，—一副不易挑當的重擔，它足以毀滅有志者的前程，厭陷廉潔者的操守！</p>
<p>無家的人又多仰羨那家是一個福地，—一副溫軟舒泰的舖陳，它足以安慰你知足長樂，鼓勵你興奮向前！</p>
<p>有家而歸不得的人追想到過去的家庭淸福，至於夢寐繫之。離家作客的人眼熱着他人的家境融洩，每逢佳節更甚。環境惡劣的人却懷消極觀念，以為出了家纔得了事。總之，事由人為，情隨勢異，實在那家是可以無愛亦無憎的。</p>
<p>人們熬辛吃苦地做人家，猶如蠶之吐絲作繭，自安其身於臫組織下的一小天地中罷瞭！</p>
<h3>枕上</h3>
<p>— 臥佛</p>
<p>我們把頭安置到枕上，該是入於最寗靜最安息的境界了；然而，事實往往相反。你在工作栗碌的時候，倒覺渾渾噩噩，無聊憂無喜，一等頭着枕上，思慮，憶念，懺悔，計劃，悲喜，恐懼，…就都像潮水一般的湧上來了。直使人疑心這個思想之府的腦子，不是生在我們的頭顱內，而是安放在枕中的；否則，何以一着枕上，就大發揮其腦的權威，腦的作用？</p>
<p>卽使枕中沒有我們的腦子，我想：至少這枕也該是我們腦府的鑰匙。當這鑰匙開啟了思想之門，何論你藏在最下一層，年深月久的影事雜感，也會毫不遺漏的搬翻出來。同時，你如要在枕上搆思什麽，計劃什麽，也會有很好的成功。這在古人已經發明，古人所說的詩成三上，其中的一上，就是枕上，他如枕上口占，枕畔閒吟等，也往往會作出更好的詩。我在家塾讀書的時候，就有這樣一個習慣：每逢老先生給了我一個作文題目，起先照例是伸紙濡筆，但結果，多數搔首抓腮，一個字也寫不出，於是就跑到床上去一橫，把枕頭墊的高些，這樣凝思了二三十分鐘，腹稿完全打好了，然後寫出來繳卷，十九會博得好評。後此枕上搆思，竟成了我作文的「枕秘」。</p>
<p>人到中年，雖然仍以筆耕為生，但枕上搆文的幸福，早已消逝了。現在枕上所掀起的思慮，是不滿的回憶，和恐懼的未來。然而，我總覺辜負了枕了。</p>
<p>因此，我認最善利用枕上的，莫如計劃，眼前一切，不是都在需要計劃嗎？於是我希望大家都把「枕頭墊墊高」，在枕上產生些計劃出來。</p>
<h3>厠所</h3>
<p>— 摩尼</p>
<p>因為一個人排洩出來的東西，含有特殊氣味，所以要安置在器具內，這種貯糞的器具，呌做便桶，專任供人便溺的地方，便是厠所。</p>
<p>在上海別說賺錢不容易，就是便溺也很麻煩，因為不能就地便溺，必須要到厠所裏去；而上海的厠所，眞不容易尋到，假使初來上海，對於出恭問題，很難解决，卽使尋到了厠所，也要買票（便紙）入內，畢竟上海地方文明。</p>
<p>在厠所裏出恭，蹲着身子，搭起臭架子，似乎不大舒服，在家中便桶裏出恭，總覺臭味難受，因為如此，自有研究便桶家用盡心機，想出一種抽水便桶，旣無臭味，又甚舒適，且潔凈異常，非便桶專家决計想不出抽水馬桶來的。</p>
<p>蘇北鹽城（西北）三十里之上岡，因為科學不昌明，還是墨陳舊法。厠所地方，都另有一屋，且有坐位，非常舒適，又甚潔凈，在每一厠門首有一匾額，題着桂花廳，木樨閣，一步樓，等名字，雖則上海有抽水便桶，但也供給高貴人們享受的，像上岡的厠所，倒也雅俗俱宜</p>
<h3>女推銷員</h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>酒的香，肉的香，猜拳聲，允笑聲，充滿着某酒樓的東花廳時，突然地，有一位手中提着一個大籐籃的事姑娘，荘重而活潑地，從門窗裏踅進來，站住着身子，把籐籃放在一個空桌上，揭開了籃蓋，把裏面的東西，掏出機句來，放在桌上。</p>
<p>這女郎，瞧着是只得十八九歲的模樣，臉兒是不長，也不矮，正合於瓜子臉的標準。膚色是相當的白嫩而細緻。嘴唇上，略塗着一些兒口紅。髪兒是燙得鬆鬆的，繫上了一條紅綢帶。身子是那麽的苗條。所以她一進門，早把全屋子，三十餘位紳士式的貴賓的呌囂聲，鎭住了，紛紛的擠往空桌那邊去，把那姑娘，圍住該心裏。六十餘歲的李老太爺，跛着一足的徐老　，時常詛咒着女性的楊博士，自命為五十年來，未曾二色過的吳局長，都擠在人羣裏，伸長着脖子，沒命的瞧着。</p>
<p>「怎麽啦？伊來幹甚麽的？」個子特別低，而鼻上架着二分厚的近視眼鏡的小余，擠在人背後，沒命的向前擠，嘴裏這麽問。</p>
<p>「×××大藥房，××藥片的推銷員。」站在前面的吿訴他。接着，那女推銷員，也開口了。用着富有韻味的口吻，諳練而動聽地述說着該藥的靈效，以及債値的低廉。最後，把躱在細長的眉兒下的一對烏黑的眼珠，向四周溜着，一一壁擎起了幾包藥物，等着購買。但是三十餘位紳士，却沒一個有所舉動，除了面面相覷之外。</p>
<p>「嘿嘿嘿，姑娘，你若能够替我喝一盅酒，我準買你三包？」小余瞇着厚玻璃眼鏡裏的一雙眼，說着，衝破了周遭的沉寂，引得大家都笑起來了。大家哈哈地笑着，準備着瞧那女推銷員的窘態。但是出於意外的，伊非但一些兒不露着窘迫，竟伸開了手，討酒喝。伊非但喝乾了小余授給伊的那一盅，陸陸續續的竟喝了六七盅。到後來，伊索性提了酒壼，自斟了一盅，帶着全屋子的人，都陪伊乾一盅。歡笑聲，重在這東花廳裏響起來，中間，更混着這女推銷員的最高的歡笑聲。</p>
<p>最後伊在每人的面前，都安放着三大包伊所推銷的藥物。大家只得伏伏貼貼地，掏出法幣一元來。不多一會，伊售得了三十餘元，欣欣地道謝着，提着籐籃，往別處推銷去了。待伊去了之後，小余猛地把雙手，在腿上一拍，失驚地道，「呀，我忘了問伊姓啥呌啥，住在那裏了！」充滿着酒意的臉上。裝着一副懊喪的神情，緊跟着，大家又是一陣哈哈的大笑。</p>
<h3>金魚漫話</h3>
<p>— 吳吉人</p>
<p>喬種金魚，前稿稍已言及，今春不侫已試之矣。此時小魚頭角漸露，計有「水泡眼反顋」，「五花堆玉」，「藍堆玉」，「洋蛋水泡」，「洋蛋朝天」等數種，經一再揀除，其齊整可觀者，數殊寥寥，惟尚未失望為可喜耳</p>
<p>「五彩小金魚」，為擇藍，紫，五花，洋龍，洋蛋，等種所攙雜而成，因藍紫兩種，其破卵成雛時，先天已成本色，故殊美觀。至如五花，洋龍，洋蛋，亦自幼卽著彩色，非若他種之非至三五月後始易紅色也。冼冠生君，感於「五彩小金魚」之可供雅室點綴，爰特定製高脚玻璃杯數千事，分盛彩魚，列於各支店六市部，取値特廉，用博顧客作消暑淸玩也。</p>
<p>明星電影公司經理周劍雲君，自借胡　作歐西考察歸來，效忠銀國，改進明星，一年來艱苦　門，卒吿成功，今次廣羅人材，大事擴展，尤著勛勞，且事必躬親，日無餘晷，邇且摒除無謂交際，得閒則寄淸魚鳥，用資調節，入其室者，錦鱗潑刺，好鳥爭鳴，想見風雅。周君甞涉足西國水族館，謂其備魚之器，樹立壁閭，左右整塊玻璃，水儲其中，復綴電燭，故奇特游魚，悉呈眼簾，水底滿舖色石，植以藻類，無異置身海底，水且常流，故魚類無恙，植藻亦所以通空氣也。今其居室中所列玻缸兩事，一為歐產熱帶魚，五色紛披，名目較諸我國金魚尤夥；一為本國種五彩金魚，種已不下十類，以其裝配美觀，蓄水淸潔，觀之令人神怡。</p>
<p>海上染業巨子諸宛明先生，公餘深好藝魚，其愛魚也，不貴多而貴精，甞相吿曰，欲魚之肥，可市米酒去其粗粒，然後就飯鑊蒸之，日給幾許，則反較日給水蛆為勝，水不多換，間日期添加淸水，兩年來，成績殊佳，昨歲之魚，頃已長及五寸，私家　魚能長成如許，確非易易。</p>
<p>著金魚飼養法一書，以較切實用，不脛而走；茲特以三版問世，當此霉令乍過，金魚易養之際，凡我濠梁雅士，允宜人手一編，有以法幣十分郵寄漕河涇鎭大街二六九號延陵寄廬者，當卽以一帙奉報焉。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第四回　視聽都非浮沉疑復柬　死生可託慷慨寄哀吟</p>
<p>及薄暮自敝歸，遇女士於途，謙謙為禮，意穆如也。觀其盎然現於面者，尤是徵畫面上之所以詰我，絕無惡意。其實昏昏如中酒者，遂又沈沈若有所思矣。晚燈旣上，思極成痴，自不知其何所企圖，繞君家里巷，環行三匝。暗巷中，有二人購燈入市，絮絮言小姐痛病之來，為居小樓，開窗終夜玩月。竊思此等另有見地之人，舍君而誰。抗君家墻外得小圃，有高柳二株。立柳下四顧，則小樓一角，燈火凄然。明知其無謂，又不解何竟為之。只是此事君可以知僕之所求者在心靈之安慰，而非佻墮不覊之徒矣。此事本不足以語君，語之，恐徒增君一層廻避。然自今以後，僕亦决不復為之矣。君旣不許我作書，我亦不應作是書，然座又以一書奉讀者，則示我並不以君之拒我而灰心而已。君得此書，以後不見我可，見我報之以怒色亦可，然我知君喜讀我所為小說，容更嘔心瀝血，多為精構，以符君之所望。雖自有此兩信之往還，慮君或因事而不復喜讀吾文。然此亦非我所計及。我以為如此能稍慰我之心靈，我卽竟為之，否則我亦苦不能安排自身也。未知所聞有病之小姐果否為君。果為君者，則敢進一言，當發奮自强，力除隱痛，而一爭自由。若有所需，赴湯蹈火，所不辭也。為書瑣千言，猶未盡意，聊作短吟，以補不足。</p>
<p>願作綠羽禽，巢君樓外柳，無復桃李嫌，終日觀戶</p>
<p>願作紫銅鏡，置君妝　台，長年為君容，勿使有塵埃。</p>
<p>願作靑霜劍，人海伴長征，閃閃三尺光，為君削不平。</p>
<p>願作天上月，終歲夜團園，永遠照珠簾，勿使君不歡。</p>
<p>願作月季花，朝朝開老圃，每日一相見，常敎君歡娛。</p>
<p>願作風雲　，為君快輕步，勿復愁坎坷，踏上自由路。</p>
<p>長宵不寐，愁思浪湧。尚欲多言，轉恐詞　。然卽此數詩，自視死生可託，知我罪我，　證之於來日。謹陳　李　女士　鑒　唳天百拜　（五七）</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<h3>加入農民隊伍後的生活</h3>
<p>— 宋廷棟</p>
<p>一個最熱天的早晨，學校開始放暑假了，許多同學都收拾行囊忙着回家，祇有我們少數的實習同學，帶了極簡單的行李乘着黃包車向窮鄕僻壤中出發。</p>
<p>這幾個同學中有的是面帶愁容，知道此去苦多樂少；有的很高興，因為他們早已下了决心，準備此去埋頭苦幹。在車輛穿過了城來到曠野的鄕村，有幾位同學竟坐在車裏睡着了，其餘幾位有說有笑，互相勸勉此去切切不可做鄕下的蝗蟲。</p>
<p>到了實騐區由總幹事分配好各人實習的地點，在區裏吃過午飯，便宜立刻分道出發，在這別離的一剎那間，眞是黯然魂銷，說不出心頭是什麽滋味。</p>
<p>我被派在當里宕四中民校，剛進門眞赫我一跳，裏面破瓦殘壁，眞好像那惠山脚下停柩的山荘，臥室中祇能容榻，那陰濕的黴氣，一陣陣的向鼻孔裏　攢進，眞呌你氣都透不過來。回想到住在學校寢室的時候，嫌紗窗不好，蚊蟲咬人，嫌設備簡陋，不合衛生，可是相形比較之下，那眞有天壤之別人。</p>
<p>在這種生活下已經是兩星期了，我已感覺着很適意，認識了許多老農，有幾個村童已和我很親暱，他們都一致同聲地說：「這位先生還嘸啥。」</p>
<p>鄕邨的生活本來是很有趣的，當你精神得到安慰時，來到這鄕間與老農為伍，不慕虛榮，不愛繁華，淸晨月夜那自然的美景眞是欣賞不了，在城市裏實有坐井觀天之嘆，在鄕間舉目遠眺，一望無涯，白雲飛起，千變萬化令人莫測；夕陽將落，滿天紅霓，美不勝收。樹上知了與田間靑蛙，相互作歌，呌價錢聽了，眞感到那電影院中樂曲，俗不可奈。在淸溪池畔，可練習游泳；在白丹山上，可訓練健跑。疲倦了樹林裏可小睡片刻，興濃時稻田裏可幫農民們插秧。竹林叢中，老樹根下，品香茗，讀書報，這不是絕妙的境地嗎？人生的苦樂，原是無標準的，同時因各人享樂的觀念不同，苦者以為樂，樂者以為苦，誰是誰非這祇好由各人自己去體會領略了。</p>
<p>鄕村裏農民的問題多得很，祇要你肯去研究，隨處都是問題待你去解决。鄕村裏社會的惡業繁得很，要你肯去苦幹，隨處都是事業待你去努力。一天的午後，我參加一個合作社的成立大會，他們門會的精神很好，討論事項，頗有條理。我心裏便宜想誰說中國民眾沒救呢？可惜這有用的民眾，始終未被人注意罷了！他們呌我訓話，我雖沒有準備，但是我很願意和這般純潔可愛的：第一組織要嚴密；第二做事要有始有終；第三要能捨私為公。他們非常高興，最後討論合作種田辦法，　批購買荳餅辦法，頗合要領。中國的民眾，祇要我們領導的人們，肯犧牲一切來做他們的導師，把自己的精神盡量地用在他們身上，這樣一年以後，中國民從的力量養成，誰敢來覬覦我們呢？我不信中國永久是老大的，無用的，被人侵略的，被人蹂躪的，祇要我們有智識的導師，下了决心，努力去喚醒民眾，犧牲了自己的精力，訓練出大批有為的民眾，中華民族的復興，一定是有希望的！朋友！我希望你們都能下個决心，向這條道路上努力去，空談不足以救國，祇有埋頭苦幹，才是脚踏实地的办法！朋友！我代表農民們，歡迎你們的來臨！</p>

<p>所謂正當商品，無疑的，自然是指國貨。這幾年來，關於提倡國貨這件事，已經由少數人的呼號變成廣大的運動，由城市的推進波及鄉鎭，幾乎是「家喩戶曉」「婦孺皆知」的事了；然而直至今天，為甚麽國貨事業還沒有進展甚至每况愈下呢？有人說，因為國貨製造不良，售價昂貴，是故責在工商界。又有們，中國人大都缺乏國家觀念，祗圖便宜，甚麽外國貨都好，至於服用洋貨對於國家有何關碍，他們全沒有顧到，因此，國貨事業之日趨　落，購用洋貨的國人應負其咎。這兩說，可以說都有理；但都不是最根本的原因。根本的原因，乃是政府對於國貨還未能處處予以充分的便利與維護！</p>
<p>第一先說工廠。我們知道，凡是辦工廠的，除非他有神經病，誰不想望自己的出品比別人家好？可是事實上，國貨中的確有些是品質不佳的。這是什麽緣故呢？要解答這問題，我們可以一究外貨所以優良的原因。據說，外國工業品的製造，政府是維護不遺餘力的，資本短少，可以請政府幫忙，有外貨來競爭，政府會替你設法抵禦，有甚麽新的發明，政府會給你獎金，你要向外推銷，政府會替你前　，他們有這種種便利，自然可以一切不用担心，一心一意研究出品的製造了。而我們中國工廠呢，一方面要籌劃金融的週轉，一方面又担心市塲寢具奪去，旣無餘資置備新式機械與　致專門人材，又要顛倒成本不能採用上好原料，其結果，自然只有草率從事了。要說工廠完全沒有責任，當然不能；但要說工廠存心粗製濫造，未免也不近情理。</p>
<p>其次說到商號。商人販售貨品，老實說，目的是將本求利；只要那種貨品來價便宜，容易銷售，就進那種貨，這自然是很合理的事。國貨因為捐稅重，製造成本大，於是，商人就捨此就彼，採辦易於脫手的外貨了。說他們是不愛國麽，甘心做漢奸的人我不敢說沒有；但我相信，大多數商號對於國貨是忍痛割愛的。最後該說一說用戶。用戶中除了一部份迷信洋貨置國家民族於腦後的準漢奸外，百分之九十九是不得已才購用洋貨的。因為洋貨藉不平等條約為護符，在我國銷售的捐稅反比我國自己的貨品來得輕，加以他們本國政府退回原料稅等等的獎勵，故其售價較我便宜，而品質又精良，這樣，國人自然要採用它了。若說愛國同胞應忍痛出重價購用國貨，這是做不到的事，縱然能夠做到，亦不能維持永久。因為貪便宜是人之常情，何况品質又好；你呌他捨棄價廉物美的外貨不買，據說在人民智識水準高於我國的先進諸國尚且無效，要呌旣貪又愚的中國人出重價買次貨，簡直是痴人說夢！</p>
<p>所以不談提倡國貨便罷，否則，首先要請政府加以維護。年來政府對於國貨事業，雖然已經較前關切得多，其顯著者，如各省公路之數設，厘金之裁撤，幣制之改革，以及工業抵押放欵之舉辦等，均已先後實行；然而這還不夠。目前工商界急切希求的，最低限度要退還原料稅，裁免轉口稅，澈底肅淸各省變相厘金的苛捐雜稅，减輕國營水陸運費，提高外貨進口稅，撲滅漏稅私貨等。唯有如此，國貨厄運才能得救，也唯有如此，民族生機才有一線曙光！</p>
<p>時期是到了最後的生死關頭了，我們以最大的熱忱，希望賢明的政府當局來採納並實行此次商會聯席會議的請求。</p>

<h3>能辦人所未辦之工業</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>—奧林匹克與吳蘊初君—</p>
<p>我國國產品，於去年參加國際勞工奧林匹克大會，在獲得一等獎品中，受獎人經指定上海天廚味精廠經理吳蘊初君，此項獎品，經由大會主席親送我國駐比使館轉我外交部，咨送實業部轉發。上月六日實業部特行授獎典禮，此光榮之盛舉，豈僅吳君一人之榮譽，亦全中國全民族之光彩也。</p>
<p>我嘗謂中國人好投機，好因襲，好享現成之局面，好為眾人皆之事業，以故任何事業，發明者少而抄襲者多，成功者少而失敗者多，尤其是今日之國貨界，凡一新興工業之萌起，便有無數人歆其大利，而先後踵起，以致供過於求，結果同歸於盡，或轉予外貨以可乘之機。發明人之無保障，新事業之難剏行，言之至堪痛心。此種惡劣心理一日不破除，中國國貨工業一日不易發展。</p>
<p>吳君蘊初，從事化學工業二十餘年，於化學旣有極大之興趣，尤有甚多之貢獻，總計其所倡事業，如天廚味精，天原鹽酸，漂粉，燒　，熾昌膠質，以及最近開辦之天利淡氣，均為眾人所未辦之事業，為眾人所不易辦之事業，不因襲，不投機，經無數之困難，用無數之精神力量，經營慘澹，以底於成。且此數種之工業均為國家基本之工業，為國防上極有關係之工業，於社會，於國家，於民族，有極大之貢獻，此誠値得欽仰，値得崇拜。奧林匹克之獎品，不過其開始耳。深望吳君本其努力化學工業之興趣之建設，此後社會之報答與紀念吳君，以及國家與世界之獎勵與鼓舞吳君者，寗有限量哉？抑尤有進者，「舜亦人也，予亦人也，彼能是，吾亦能是。」希望國內之化學家，以及一切之工業家，人人善用其腦力，善用其精神，各思創造，各思發明，追隨吳君之後，亦有種種之建設，能辦人所未辦之工業，以報效於社會國家世界，一雪中國人不知創造只享現成之恥，則中國新工業之光輝，益復璀璨，全世界之發明史上，我中國人將占巨大之篇頁，其榮幸為何如耶？勗哉吳君，勗哉全國之化學家與工業家，其亦聞風興起，再接再厲以進展乎？</p>
<h3>台州之蓆業</h3>
<p>— 孫麟昌</p>
<p>台州在浙省臨安縣境，地勢背山面水，素以產蓆著稱，故凡草蓆中每有台蓆之名。然海上售蓆，喧稱台灣，殊不知台灣無蓆草，幷無人織蓆，故「台灣」二字，實係「台州」之誤，此或因當初作俑者，以台灣來路較遠，故示誇大的口吻，藉資號召耳。後人積習相沿，隨聲附和，對斯「台灣」二字，幾成為草蓆之固定名詞，而眞正之台州名蓆，則反湮沒不彰，因特辯正於此。</p>
<p>台州蓆，蓆草細長柔軟，故品光滑而耐用，蓆邊之粗直徑，係用龍　草織成，此草產自就地山谷間，形似蒲而細，台州蓆具此二特點，故為他蓆所不及。</p>
<p>台州蓆之原料，均由當地農民處植，每戶數畝或數十畝不等，春初下種，秋可收割，曝乾後卽可應用。織蓆之機，以木為之，構造簡單，狀如井字，有木　及竹製之通草刀各一，織時一人持　，一人通草，夏秋二季日長，每機每日可織蓆四床，科春二季日短，又因天寒冰凍，蓆草須先浸水使透，方可應用，故每日只能織三床，平均每機年可產蓆一千二百八十餘床。照全縣共有一千五百三十餘架機子計算，每年應出蓆一千九百六十捆。（每捆百床）此項蓆子，當地人民除運銷於隣近各縣外，餘多屯積在家，候蓆販收買，輸至滬杭轉售各埠。</p>

<h3>提倡國貨不是靠一張嘴</h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>「提倡國貨，不是靠一張嘴。」換一句話說，便是「提倡國貨，」是要實幹的。不是空口說白話，所可以獲得效果的。</p>
<p>本來是我們中國人，只有一張嘴，是最高明的。無論什麽事情，也不僅是「提倡國貨」這一椿事，只知道嘴上說，不知道實地幹。所以數十年來，到如今大家依然免不了要喊「提倡國貨」這句口號，以勸人提倡「國貨。」而市面上依然免不了有「洋貨」出售，依然免不了有人要買「洋貨！」細想起來，這就不能歸咎大家只知道嘴上說，不知道實地幹。</p>
<p>記得有人曾經這樣的說過：「英國人只做不說，德國人做了再說，日本人說了就做，中國人只說不做。」這幾句話，眞是一針見血，慨乎言之！這樣看來，那又何怪人家是一天富强如一天，而我們却一天貧弱如一天呢？</p>
<p>唉！現在閒話休說，總而言之，我們縱然不能彀「只做不說，」縱然不能彀「做了再說」好麽，最低的限度，也當「說了就做，」莫老是這樣「只說不做」啊。</p>
<p>要知道，凡事「只說不做，」，便「一世無成。」尤其是「提倡國貨，」不是光靠一張嘴的！</p>

<h3>失去了童貞！</h3>
<p>未婚的靑年為了什麽動機，就失去了童貞？其對像又是怎樣的女性？這些要是研究起來，倒是一件很有趣味的事情。</p>
<p>不過大體上言：靑年因為性慾的衝動，急不擇食，失去童貞的對象，最多的當然要算娼妓了，而其年齡以十八歲到二十歲的靑年最多，這眞是靑年的隱憂，何况又多數因了嫖逛娼妓而失掉童貞，越發令人憂慮之至了。且看下例一個靑年的來信，多麽悲慘而殘酷呦！</p>
<p>編輯先生：我是一個二十幾的商店夥計，在上年的一個秋夜，因為生殖器起了濃厚的刺激，竟至一夜不能入睡，第二夜我為了避免這種痛苦，就去實行嫖妓，這是我初試雲雨。我明知道這是危險的勾當，但怎經得起慾火的燃燒，從此之後，禍患就臨了，我不但失去了童貞，而且性病菌弄汚了我的純淸血液，不到七天，暴發了白濁病，小便時起了從未嘗過的刺痛，尿道口腫脹紅赤，白色乳汁般的黏液不斷流出。嵵陰莖伸展大不自由，勃起時疼痛異常，而且偏會時時勃起，我直給它痛得難於入眠，當時我為了職業關係，絕對秘密，偷偷地去購了幾種淋病藥，不料仍然沒有效果，祗得再去請醫診察，據說已經是轉入慢性了，治療上很費週折，並且需要六十元的包醫代價，我當然沒有如許的錢，祗得硬挺。這時雖然痛苦减少，而淋濁依然流出，這樣過了六個月，不但身體日形萎靡，而且會時時遺精，白日覺得頭錯腦脹，行動疲憊，肌肉也削瘦得不成人樣，我想再不設法，恐怕要妨害我的職業了，因此將我的病情經過，向英哥盡情吐露，他對我說，可以拿黃色素和伐克辛調合精製的「安敵淋」試試看，因為曾經有個同事治愈過，同時他關照我說，身體若感覺衰弱，那末必須要服「生殖素」，如有遺精，則「希米脫氏固精片」可以根治，這三種藥我以前尚未用過，所以很信任去購來服了，果然不到三星期，白濁，遺精相繼根治，並且因為服了「生殖素」之後，身體非常强壯，精神也異樣興奮，因此之故，而我的飯碗依然保持，不然是凶多吉少了！　（一鳴寫於無錫庽所）</p>
<p>夫婦智識</p>
<p>— 兪伯符醫師特撰</p>
<h3>不容忽視的婚後衰弱</h3>
<p>婚後體質衰弱的原因及其他危險性　性慾過度能使新陳代謝機能滯緩　不孕症與神經衰弱症的挽救途徑</p>
<p>結婚在多數人心目中是不可避免的一回事。所以婚後的健康，實在値得討論和研究。一般人說：夫婦和諧的主要條件，就是意志和體格，原來的所謂意志，是體格所賦予的性質，澈底的一句話：就是體格强壯的，意志堅强，體格虛弱的，意志薄弱，所謂意志，是被體格所支配。所以體格實為夫婦和好的重要基礎。</p>
<p>如果體格衰弱而多病或不孕的，往往成為夫婦間破裂的導線，家庭就難得圓滿，幸福是完全喪絕！</p>
<p>一向體質衰弱的，或曾罹有神經衰弱症的，那末結婚後會將衰弱的程度愈隱愈深。也有的在結婚以前，本極健康，自結婚後，身體减瘦，活氣銷沉，肌肉瘦削，而一切神經衰弱症也相繼發生。本來結婚是一種快樂的探求，若結婚之後，不特所期待的不曾實現，反於身體有害，這是何等的不幸呢！我們詳細調查這些原因，凡是結婚後衰弱的人，除了體質配合錯誤的問題以外，由於性慾放縱的居多，因為結婚是性愛實現的開始，漸漸入於歡樂之境，靑春的慾火燃煎，不克制止，不知不覺間，就把寳貴的身體損傷了，以致成了多病的樣子。結果男子就　容易惹起陰痿，早洩及神經衰弱症。女子除了神經衰弱症之外，月經不調，如果體虛過分的結果，帶下也不能避免了。姙娠的希望絕難實現。</p>
<p>總之要掃除這種障碍，不論在婚前婚後，都可以用培補生殖腺的方法，加以補救，因為生殖腺旺壯的人們，一切新陳代謝的機能亦健。如奧國生理學家斯丹那氏所發明以少壯動物提取其生殖腺素製成之「生殖素」內服藥，對於培補人體的生殖腺有特殊的功效，它能夠使全身新陳代謝的機能加速，挽回衰頹，幫助每個男女都有强固的性能。而陰萎，早洩，月經不調，婚後不孕的幣害，都可藉彼超然的藥力，很快解决，絕無困難。所以「生殖素」的特殊成分，差不多成了人們生命健康有力的原素。</p>
<h3>骨痛治療的常識補充</h3>
<p>— 賈治中醫師</p>
<p>何謂骨痛？如腰痛酸痛，骨節酸楚筋絡牽疼，腦骨刺痛等，統名之為骨痛。這都是由平時瘋濕的積累，熱毒的逐漸蘊積所致。所以本病的發作，决非短期內所可一蹴而成的。</p>
<p>所以平時操勞過度的人，及體質衰弱者，都易罹本症；除此之外，血份不潔，尿酸過多，則尤易引起本症，因為血份不潔之後，而血液內的尿强酸質，每變成形如細小碎玻璃屑樣的尿强酸晶，存留於骨則骨痛，入筋則筋痙，入肌則肌瘦，入肢則肢麻，重則全身陷於半身不遂，輕者亦不勝其酸痛之苦了。</p>
<p>患者褚明之，年四十歲，患骨痛症已八年矣，至上年冬，大發特發，形成全身疼痛，且動作不自然，有時筋絡亦陷覺牽疼，四肢拘攀。這人大恐，雖服骨痛藥多種，仍然無濟於事，直至今年春末始得友人介紹，向五洲藥房購服「强斯登氏骨痛片」約有六匣，大見其效。蓋入夏以來，三閱月中，並不發作，雖雲雨之時亦全不感覺也。故「强斯登氏骨痛片」的神效，確非他藥所可與之並驅也。</p>
<h3>花柳科戒煙科臨診述例</h3>
<p>— 香港醫科大學醫學學士吳大超實錄</p>
<p>（一）淋病傳染妻子</p>
<p>患者為一洗染店之賬房，姓韋，蘇之南翔人，現年三十一歲，。性好漁色，故時作狎邪遊。（主訴）——患淋病失治，迭就某庸醫試非特異性療法，均歸無效，致淋病一再復發。今年又曾作不潔之性交，其妻已早受其傳染，現在夫婦變患淋濁，本當携妻同來診視，因妻堅執不允，祗得自來乞醫。現本人的病象，為睪丸腫脹，疼痛異常。（病歷）——韋君自云於二月初旬應朋友之約，赴六馬路某某旅館雀戰，其中有一堂口之茶房姓葉，為余所識，彼乃謂余曰，新近有一漂亮之妓女，來自首都，且擅淸唱，據彼自云為夫子廟的歌妓，因營業淸淡，故來上海轉換皮肉生涯。余本喜皮簧，聞此有意外之便宜，乃欣然徵招，不料春風三度，而淋病竟如此之劇烈，不得不請為澈底根治。（治療）——余除吿以攝生方法外，為了要使睪丸不使動搖，乃以提睪帶擊之。另囑向永安公司購以黃色素和伐克辛配製而成的內服藥「安敵淋」令彼夫婦同時服之，並堅决關照，須絕對不可間斷，至少須服四盒，其他對於大小便的通暢，和飲食操勞之限制，異常綦嚴，如此約經過五星期，韋君之妻子，及韋君惡化之睪丸炎，均得根治痊愈。</p>
<p>（二）胃痛煙癮戒除</p>
<p>患者為一中年之女性，年三十五歲，染煙毒甚深，彼於二十六歲時始上癮。（主訴）——因胃痛之故，致染煙癖，近來胃痛依然頗發，煙癮難戒，失眠不安。且有白帶，淋漓甚劇。（病歷）——當初吸煙時，似覺胃痛和緩，余乃大喜過望，以為多年不治之胃病，竟有脫離之一日，不料後此兩年，胃痛依然復發，而同時本人之煙量亦與日俱增，刻欲返鄉久居，而鄉間適煙禁甚嚴，故不得不亟求戒除。（治療）——余囑向華美藥房購服「胃痛靈」治其胃病，並以「療帶靈」搽之，以止其白帶然後再以培補戒煙靈藥「生殖素」除其煙癮，為减少其痛苦起見，再注射「育維賜保命」，如此數方兼顧，不到三月，胃痛竟愈，而煙癮亦安然戒絕白帶從此絕跡，刻彼已搭輪返鄉，從此脫離黑籍矣。</p>
<h3>遺精—滑精的合理根治法</h3>
<p>— 王士英醫師</p>
<p>人的精液，充滿於精囊。於是慾念旺盛，而陰莖勃起，因為囊質所吸收的精液濃厚過敏，極易溢出，這就是健康者遺精的原因。所以雖不性交，而無意間也有遺精的。</p>
<p>犯手淫的人，勢必發生神經衰弱，和性機能障碍，於是射精神經中樞成為過敏，所以稍受刺戟立時就會遺精。大部分的原因，由於輸精管鬆懈，精關不固，此之謂病理的遺精。惡化時竟會不知不覺間將精液滑出，並有下列之病狀：筋力疲乏，身體衰弱，消化不良，呼吸中有惡臭，顏色灰白，眼若昏睡而無光，感覺過敏，智力記憶力都减退，恐怖悲痛的感念甚深，頭痛耳鳴，身體時覺戰慄而異常枯瘦。</p>
<p>總之不論生理與病理，對於身體上終是有損無益。根治之法，宜服「希米脫氏固精片」以培補精關，而根治遺精。同時最好再服「生殖素」以補治業已損壞之生殖機能，此為最合理之根治方法，效力較任何方法為速。</p>
<p>陰癢白帶</p>
<p>先生：余受白幫之苦，已三年矣，且流量甚多，並有奇臭，故終年不潔，陰癢難當，雖日加洗滌，未能見效，蓋長此以往，余將永無消除之日，前曾搽藥多種，然均失敗，懇請吿以治療之法，不勝感激。</p>
<p>（周士英問）</p>
<p>（答）可向永安公司購「癢帶靈」搭之，即愈，如為體虛之故，則再服「女用生殖素」可也。</p>
<p>衰弱胃痛</p>
<p>鄙人體素衰弱，中年即感胃痛。同時食慾不振，每於晨起胃中有酸水吐出，如稍飽即感胃痛，平時噁心嘔吐，精神大苦，乃吸煙取緩，不料又染煙癮，而胃痛未見减輕，請問服何藥方可使胃痛痊愈，貪慾增進，煙癮戒煙，（張誠忠）</p>
<p>（答）可服「胃痛靈」以治胃痛，再服「健胃素」以助長食慾，然後再服戒煙聖劑「生殖素」除其煙癮，收效甚速。</p>
<p>生育問題</p>
<p>鄙人今年卅歲，於廿四年春季結婚，先時于廿二歲起即犯手淫之習，直至結婚方始戒除，奈婚後又患見色即舉，並有精液流出，甫交一二分鐘即洩，請問可有生育之望？服何藥有效？　（商承志謹問）</p>
<p>（答）此名性神經衰弱症，為早年手淫之結果，服藥中以「生殖素」最為有效，可日服三次，當可恢復壯健，照常生育，</p>
<p>戒煙敎訓</p>
<p>鄙人在廿一歲時，已染煙癮，為父母所悉，勒令戒除，雖百藥雜投，均不能發生效力，直至今年卅三歲，服「生殖素」之後，始得戒絕，當初試服時每日三次，約三星期後，即感覺煙量銳减，不到二月，完全戒絕，共祗服藥六盒。而竟將十年老癮，絕於一旦，可謂幸矣，</p>
<p>腰背酸痛</p>
<p>鄙人腰背酸痛，已有一載，今春始覺加劇，服藥電療，時愈時發，始終未能根治，為特專函懇問應服何藥？方可不發。</p>
<p>（浦東孫志明）</p>
<p>（答）尊病須診察後，方知究竟，然欲避免骨痛之苦，可服「强斯登氏骨痛片」有效，</p>

<p>（一）遺精煙癮並獲救治</p>
<p>患者沈介明君，年三十八歲，浙之奉化人，業商。沈君於成童時，為劣友所誘，誤犯自凟惡癖，久習成慣，積重難返，頻頻自伐，耗傷頗深。因之身虧體弱，罹有頭暈腦痛，精神萎靡，失眠健忘等症，始凛於於其為害之烈，而痛自戒除，然已釀成賢虧腰酸，遺精夢洩之症，初尚有夢而洩，一月數回；繼且無夢而遺，一旬多回，虧憊不堪，體力難支，雖曾服補劑多種，然功效欠缺，未得根治，後在友人處吸煙取緩，遂致上癮，邇來政府嚴令戒煙，然因戒時痛苦彌甚，難竟全功，繼由其至友陶靜山先生介紹來余處診治，經余投用「希米脫氏固精片」固其精管，並囑服「生殖素」培補虧損，斷癮去毒，同時為之注射「育維賜保命」以减少其戒時之痛苦，用此釜底抽薪，一勞永逸之療法，不出兩月，沈君已面色紅潤，遺精之病，澈底而愈，同時煙癮亦安然戒絕，體重亦逐漸增加云。</p>
<p>（二）童年結婚陰萎性弱</p>
<p>患者馮叔良君，年祗十九，世居浦東，務農為業。馮君因結婚過早，且對方為已發育成熟之年長女子，較馮君年長三齡，蓋此種結合，純為父母之命，媒妁之言。婚後一年，即患早洩，至十八歲時，因房勞過度，體虛愈烈，甚至陰痿不舉，同時肌肉瘦削，精神萎頓，有時竟感覺耳鳴，目眩，聽力銳减。健忘失眠等症，遂相繼暴發。故結婚三年，尚無生育，彼之父母，鑒此情形，始驚惶失措，遍求良醫，收效甚鮮，乃於今春由彼伯父之介紹始來余處診治，余除用最新式之電療外，並以滋補生殖腺最為之「生殖素」服之，如是經神亦較前倍增，肌肉亦富有血色，體重約增加十二磅，馮君乃愈信服，同時絕對禁止性交，約二個月之久，早洩陰痿等症盡失，全身亦重獲發育矣。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談談遺產稅問題</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>昨日我寫了陳濟棠以淚洗面一文，因而憑到近日政府，擬積極計劃徵收這產稅問題，陳氏眞是一個遺產深毒的一個好榜樣，繼承財產，本為不勞而獲的應享權利，然在近代社會經濟的理論上講，是應該課稅的，所以先進國家，不但都重視遺產稅，並且以遺產稅為國家重要稅源之一，據經濟學者的解釋，遺產稅有節制資本的機能，發展社會生產的作用，並且是以消除國民的依賴性，而促其自力奮鬥，這是經濟學者從學理上推求的結果，其說天然是不差的。</p>
<p>但我以為這還不是一個根本的辦法，根本的辦法，索性廢除遺產制為乾淨，因而徵收遺產稅，非但有種種的麻煩，抑且有百出得弊賓，我國國民財產，向無確實之調查，而繼承財產，亦無向官廳登記的規定，且繼承遺產，為我國數千年來承襲之舊制，一旦徵收遺產稅，勢必國民經濟，多向外國銀行存儲，以逃避國家的徵收，或捏名他人的財產，以資規避，再其次，徵收遺產稅，僅徵收其一部份，而尙有其大部份，作為遺產，則子孫仍得安富尊榮，席豐履厚，為祖父者，更當多事居積，居積愈多，則徵稅之外，還可使子孫享用不盡地。</p>
<p>我不懂經濟學，我更不懂經濟運用的原理，惟照現在我國經濟的情形，謂徵收遺產稅有節制資本的機能，和發展社會生產作用，我不敢說，而謂能消除國民的依賴性，而促其自力奮鬥，更是難言。故我謂徵收遺產稅而能使國家增加經濟上一大部份的收入則可，而謂能節制資本，發展生產，則亦不過一稅名詞而已，因為我國的資本，照現在情形論，應該增加之不暇，遑論節制，而發展生產，亦當看其生產之方法，與其用途。</p>
<p>故我的主張，非反對徵收遺產稅也，而更進一步，索性廢除遺產制，人類原為自私的動物，我鑑於陳濟堂的近事，和社會的情形，多是遺產制之作祟，實有廢除遺產制之必要，所謂遺產者，遺其子孫也，遺其曾孫玄孫，以至於無窮孫也。故積產愈多，則留遺愈廣而愈遠，故不惜剝削苛求，剖刻聚歛，則其為害也愈甚而愈多，若遺產之制廢除，則知積資居奇之無用，而聚斂搜刮之無容，實足以減少其予取予求之貪壑，非但對於經濟上的觀念必稍輕視，而損人利己之念，亦可以不生，卽公共事業，社會生產，亦可因此發展。如是國家的收入愈多，而社會的財奴亦少，這不是一舉而兩得的事麼。</p>
<h3>破土</h3>
<p>— 芷夫</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>天亮，鷹爪山下的人們醒來了，像野雀似的，一個個從那些低矮的草棚門裏爬了出來。</p>
<p>他們時刻在留意着關於築路的工程。最近，那劉監工曾經來山下當着人們說過一遍話：</p>
<p>「……我們冒着炎天，把荒地丈量，奠碑一，劃界，色綫二……現在工作可算完備了，六月半，咱們就要動工破土呢三。派差和編遺的程序，卽日就可公佈了！這裏，鷹爪山一段，歸咱老劉跟郭麻臉倆監工的……」</p>
<p>他的說話興奮地，整個山下的人們，就此瞪大了眼烏珠，候等着——六月半——那個破土的吉日。</p>
<p>在這近日期的前夜，他們就把那些鐵鏟，鋤子，和挖泥開道的工具，磨練得發了亮，全個山谷中，只是鏗鏘地發着一切金屬所吼榨出來的響聲。</p>
<p>每個人的熱望更濃厚了起來——</p>
<p>「完成了工作，咱們是享樂了！咱們和外界媾通了，咱們是……咱們……」</p>
<p>「但是，幾時可以完工？爸啊……」</p>
<p>「快的！……」</p>
<p>住在山坡的斜坳裏的居民，那個生來像頭黃狼似的堆了滿頭白髮的老農夫翁阿虎，起着比人們更愉快的渴思，他兒子小阿兔笑着痩削的黑臉，玩弄着鐵挖疑問他。</p>
<p>雖然使他們理解不清一切的作用，但一種神怪的期待，充溢在父子們的頭腦裏……</p>
<p>一陣很適意的早風吹刮着，高挿在山巔的鮮紅的小旗幟飄搖了，幾乎把人的眼光抖得潦亂。</p>
<p>留意着有紅旗子的附近，也就能找到白的羊腸一樣的粉道。郭麻臉們早幾天在山上下就是幹着這些工作的。</p>
<p>人們將要根據這綫條，把鋤頭子和汗血去鏟平它……</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>鷹爪山的人們從未有過的興奮的騷動，在那天的正午展開了。</p>
<p>劉監工，老郭麻臉，一夥大約十多人，斜戴着草裝帽，在太陽爬上了屋脊的時候趕到了山下。</p>
<p>戴着二鐵車的工具，滿滿的，堆累了竹筐，泥籃，槓子，銅爐……</p>
<p>「老鄉們！今天破土……」</p>
<p>「我們在西山脚下礦地裏集中……老弟兄！」</p>
<p>尖銳的嗓子，同時呌喊了起來：</p>
<p>「劉監工！把咱們派差在那一段工作？」</p>
<p>「五里崗……」</p>
<p>「開始墾土吧！」</p>
<p>「破土，……先坎樹……」</p>
<p>「哦！……」</p>
<p>於是，人們重新回進草棚的門裏，把鋤子荷在肩頭，興奮地向着山下走去……</p>
<p>在遼闊的曠塲上，人接踵地，像螞蟻一樣地　集着。空氣是變得緊張了！那廣泛的人聲就從這喧囂的山脚下散播開來。</p>
<p>合村的人誰都瘋狂得幾乎手舞足跳呢。</p>
<p>四周便像受了針灸般地寂然了，連那巍峨的鷹爪，也寗靜底彷彿一個祥慈的老年人似的，在虔祝着他們的期望！</p>
<p>一奠硬　在丈量劃界之後，便豎上一塊鑾字的石碑，這手續，俗稱——奠碑。</p>
<p>二色綫　把築路的界綫，用石灰拭上一條白色的界綫。</p>
<p>三破土　這是一種俗習，在開工之前必須要行一個「破土」的慣例，有似現在流行的——剪帶禮，揭幕禮……相同的風氣。</p>

<h3>我國的養蜂養兔事業（上）</h3>
<p>— 菲</p>
<p>（本報特稿）我國不論在地利上，在氣候上，對於養蜂是非常適宜的；而且養蜂不但管理簡便，更無需大量的資本，只要是蜜源豐富得區域，有數百元的資本，和五畝土地，就能夠開辦一個養蜂塲了。</p>
<p>養蜂是很好的農村副業，它的生利旣優，對於花菓之帮助也很大；歐美各國不僅對於養蜂事業之提倡頗力，並且在每一個菓園附近都有蜂羣之　裝，以此增進菓實的生產。但我國的一般農人缺乏常識，以為蜜蜂有害於菓樹的；雖也有些人家飼養着一兩羣蜂的；那也不過養着玩玩，不知管理方法，結果都是逃走和死亡。</p>
<p>在我國首先提倡改良養蜂事業的是一位華繹之先生，他在民國元年就在無錫蕩口鎮，用新式方法飼養意大利蜂了。到現在，蜂種的推廣以及長江一帶及華南等地，其數不下三四萬箱，而各地養蜂塲的成立也幾若雨後春笋。其已著有成績者如立達，青春，大衆，華繹之，笑農，甘永懋，等養蜂塲卽中華蜂種改良塲，他們在養蜂事業上都是比較有歷史的。</p>
<p>蜂種中以意大利蜂最為優良，現在美國飼養此種蜂羣約有四百餘萬箱；我國幅員廣大，花草豐茂，如能提倡飼養，是不難超過此數的。</p>
<p>每箱平均每年的產蜜量約五十斤，普通每百斤約值二三十元。</p>
<p>蜜的功用頗廣，除中西藥品，化妝品，糖果，茶事糕餅中必須採用者外，還可以代替砂糖，可以釀製蜜酒，——立達學國蔣鴻澤先生有眞蜜酒之製售，這是用他自己發明的「蜂蜜釀酒法」製成的，（現立達農場中有代售。）可以作蜜茶飲。德國鄉村中卽以蜜茶獻客。——可以製滋補品，沖入牛乳中餵飼小孩更佳。蜜為半消化品，所以不會發生糖尿病，而且它會吸收濕氣，有止咳之功。</p>
<p>次等的蜜也好製機器油，冷天不會凝結。也能製皮鞋油。枇杷，荔枝，龍眼，橘子等蜜，其味十分清香甘美，泡成蜜茶可以代替咖啡茶。</p>
<p>除了蜜有很多功用外，其臘的用處也頗多，譬如化學品及藥品中，也有臘的需要。並且據說純淨臘的價值是也很昂貴的。</p>
<p>我國各地的蜜源分佈，區域甚廣；像，廣東，福建，有橘子，荔枝，龍眼，黃皮，油菜等花可供採取。雲南有加利，江浙有油菜，紫雲英，烏柏，蒿麥，橘，橙，茶等。四川有油菜，橘子，野花，北方有槐，棗子等。</p>
<p>在江浙一帶並且還適宜於流動式的轉地飼養，用民船或火車均可轉運；春季採油菜，紫雲英，夏季採烏柏，秋天採蒿麥，冬天採枇杷，茶花。</p>
<p>不過，現在我國的養蜂事業還很幼稚；而且只是像散沙一般的沒有團結力，沒有組織，如果，大家能夠聯合起來，組織一個蜂蜜的推銷合作社，則不但蜜的出路廣大，而飼養的蜂羣也因此而會增加起來了。我甚盼關心農村副業者，注意及此。</p>

<h3>海燕劇社繼續徵求演員</h3>
<p>海燕劇社因排演高爾基之「蒲雷曹夫」，曾於日前公開徵求男女演員，中間因欲參加（二日）滬西幹公小學校友會五週紀念串演「父子兄弟」等劇，致延時日，計合格者有孫以梅，長孫不為，等七人，不日卽將開始排練。惟是劇需用女演員頗多，故五日起至十日止再繼續徵求女演員四人，凡愛好演劇者，請每日下午二時起親至北西藏路橋　華通坊七號該社面洽。</p>
<p>聞該社對於市劇異常重視，將　請對戲劇有訊究者組織該劇本演出研究會，討論各項演出計劃，並為減低觀眾負擔，演出座價祗售法幣二角，入塲券不日印就預售云。</p>
<h3>海棠紅序幕</h3>
<p>戲　上，蹦蹦戲女伶海棠紅（白玉　飾）正演着他的傑作「杜十娘」，臺下觀眾鼓着掌。</p>
<p>包廂裏，督軍府秘書長（王吉亭飾）用他尖銳的目光向海棠紅注視，他暗忖這樣一個色藝雙絕的女伶是最適合督軍（譚　遠飾）命令他每天替督軍物色美女的標準，海棠紅自然逃不過督軍的勢力，被呌道督軍府陪同督軍侑酒取樂。</p>
<p>海棠紅的丈夫（王獻　飾）是一個向歧路上走的人，每天只知賭博取樂，不事生產，家庭的生活負擔旣要他妻子肩任，賭金也得要妻子供給，在不能滿足他的慾望時，就用暴虐的手段來對付她，因為是封建社會的時代，可憐她受了封建的桎梏，而無處呻吟，只有屈服，她唯一的希望，就是他的兒子，她把生命寄託在兒子的身上，決心用他的力量來造就她兒子未來的前程，使她兒子在未來的社會上做一個堂堂的人，然而他的丈夫在四方的賭債逼迫之下，偷去了他父親一生的留作棺木金的儲蓄，更在一個深夜裏偷偷的把兒子賣去，這不嘗是在她的心靈下割下一條巨深的創傷，她瘋狂的喊着「完了！兒子完了！我也完了！什麽都完了！」</p>
<p>是的，兒子是她的生命，兒子完了，她怎夠能不悲痛的而瘋狂呵！</p>
<p>督軍又想到前次太不能給他滿足的海棠紅了，派秘書長來强制的呌她去。這時她存下了死念，在席間，她花言巧語使督軍迷醉的當兒，突的抽出白刃，對督軍的胸膛刺去，可是督軍未被刺着，她已被侍衛捉住押到堅牢裏去了。</p>
<p>革命軍的到來，使她出了獄，然而已無家可歸，在茫茫的大地上流浪，在長途辛苦跋踄中，她找到了十年前被賣的兒子，她那憔悴的沒有血絲的臉上才展開了一絲的笑影。</p>

<h3>美國運貨車市塲活躍</h3>
<p>— 摩亞</p>
<p>美國的運貨汽車市塲近來非常的活蹤。各商用汽車和運貨汽車製造商。都顯着光明的前途。為近年來稀有的好現象。單拿美國國內零售市塲來講。在一九三六年的上半年中。已經銷去了三〇〇，〇〇〇輛的運貨汽車。在一九二九年的時候却祗有二六三，一九二輛。因之運貨汽車界中人。預計本年中運貨汽車的銷數可達到六〇〇，〇〇〇輛。這個目標的能達到。大家都很抱着樂觀呢。</p>
<p>近來運貨汽車事業接速着欣欣向榮。正月份的天氣雖很寒冷。銷數却有四三，〇〇〇輛，二月份的交貨數量達四〇，〇〇〇輛。從二月份起。銷數的綫條逐漸上昇着。到了四月份。它的紀錄打破了近來的同時期紀錄。銷去的運貨汽車為數達六五，〇〇〇輛，五月份的銷售總數為六〇，〇〇〇輛，除了國內市塲的好現象外，政府機關和各部會所購買的運貨汽車。為數也極廣大。更有出口的數量均沒有計算在內。運貨汽車的銷售。在全年中已有着平衡發展的現象。差不多一年十二個月中。各方面需要股亟。已現着很穩定的樣子。其徵象和客車製造商所希冀的如出一轍。一九三五年的上半年六個月中。百分之五十的運貨汽車業在這時期中所完成。下半年中的營業並不見能超過上半年。一九三四年時。運貨汽車事業中百分之五十二的營業。是在下半年的六個月中所完成。總之一句話。運貨汽車已經到了一個極可喜的地步。就是買主已經不為節季的關係。而變更其購買的態度了。</p>
<p>本年中美國運貨車業的大部份來自農村。其成數之大。為其各單方面所不及。美國農人所　有的運貨汽車。佔全國運貨汽車總數的百分之二十六。在最不景氣的當兒。他們所購置的汽車不過百分之八而已。今年據此業中兩大公司的估計。農村方面所購置的運貨汽車。可達全部銷數的百分之三十。</p>
<p>因為各方面訂購運貨汽車的定單。一天多似一天。各車廠的裝配工作便也隨着而恢復了。關於這方面的刺激。當然一部份由於政府的直接和間接資助而來的。轉運公司方面所購置的運貨汽車。為數很是不少。尤其在曳引機和拖車相併的幾家。大規模的車行。他們添置的數目更見廣多，有幾家百貨商店計劃出一種新式的運貨車。它的裝載量。較了現在習見的運貨車。其每方尺的容量增加了不少。而且裝卸兩方面都較前便易多多。這種車子的市塲銷路顯見很廣。因為它們在日用上已有不凡的優長處。小商人的定單。尤其在郊外的許多商店。對於這種汽車訂購最多。</p>
<p>各公司對於購買運貨汽車的主顧。和買客車的主客。實行給予百分之六的資助計劃。這樣一來營業上確實增進了不少。大運貨汽車的銷路。現在雖仍繼續着向上。可是小型運貨汽車。為得减少所付稅捐起見。銷路比大車更好。今年的一噸半汽車。因為捐照費較重的緣故。半噸小型車大有起而代之之勢。最近各車公司因鑒於小型車的暢銷？已有多家製造四分之三噸的應市。「機室在引擎上」式的一種運貨車。因為它裝載量增多的綠故。和長度不超過規定。及運用上的效率增加起見。銷路的趨勢大見增進。這個現象不但在重稅車方面如此。就是曳拖機車等也莫不相仿。</p>
<p>運貨汽車製商對所流綫化型的訴求並沒有漠視，流綫型的為大衆所注意。這固然是不錯的。然運貨汽車的唯一要素在它的用途。總使表裏相稱。纔得相見益彰。油公司所用以載運油產的汽車。都作流綫化型。當由分輸站運到經售商的服務站時。一路招搖過市。倒也是一個絕妙的廣告哩。第塞爾引擎車在將來當能盛行。不過現在還不能在市塲中爭雄。在目下一個。零買的主顧。他能把較少的金錢購買一輛完全燃用汽油的運貨車。若是第塞爾式的價格上就要高上許多。底盤車身及其各方面尚不計算在內。不過目下各著名運貨汽車製造廠。都極力在研究造一種優良的第塞爾引擎車。務使在經濟及運用方面。得到消費及便捷的長處。而售價方而却須低廉。以期普及</p>
<h3>汽車短訊一束</h3>

<h3>海外車賽新訊（續）</h3>
<p>— 雲</p>
<p>四汽缸車又列前茅</p>
<p>五月三十日為美國南北戰士紀念日。印第亞那之汽車比賽卽於是日舉行。獲得冠軍者為加利福尼亞之梅猶氏。其所駕者為四汽缸汽車。平均每小時之速率為一〇九•〇六九英里。梅猶係一三次獲勝之汽車跑駛家。此次以四缸車而打破其以前之個人紀錄。亦堪令人注意者也。渠前曾駕一複式汽缸汽車參予比賽。一九三〇年時則曾駕一十六缸汽車。以每小時九五·二五三英里之速率獲得第四位。此次參加各車中。前十輛之七輛為四缸者。八缸者三輛。六缸者則無有焉。自一九一一年來。十次之勝利屬於四缸車。而一九三四．三五．三六連續三年均為四者獲冠軍。印第亞那車賽之全程為五百英里。汽油限制為每車三十七半加侖。梅猶於比賽完畢之時。油櫃中所剩之汽油尚餘三加侖半。平均每加侖汽油可行十五英里。予賽之汽油十輛。未屆終點因油罄而被迫退出。惠萊土哇浮蘭公司總理大衛惠萊士。對於印第亞那車賽中四汽缸車之成功。曾謂梅猶之紀錄。可證四缸車之速率與燃油經濟。惟四缸車可以獲之。殆無疑義焉。按惠萊士車廠製造四缸汽車已有二十八年之經騐。惠氏又稱。當惠萊士車每加侖汽油可行三十五英里時。其他汽車之燃料消耗量。勢將如梅猶車之每小時行百英里時者。四缸車之特點除燃油經濟外。又有卓特之持久力。如五百英里之印第亞那車賽中所需者。故聞惠萊士公司將根據共三十八年之製造經騐。賡續四缸之製造云。</p>
<p>七英里之新賽車塲</p>
<p>英人近在柯克城附近籌築一七英里之汽車競賽塲。如此項計劃能照預算者實現。則在國際車賽節中。此新賽車塲中將有最高速率之汽車比賽舉行。此計議中之競賽塲內包括一段長三英里之着名跑道。介於柯克及茄立羅漢兩地之間。英國之機器脚踏跑賽家拉愛脫氏。數年前曾以每小時一百五十餘英里之速率。樹立世界速率紀錄。倫敦賽車家范壽斯敦好夫。近曾在柯克賽經中駛車。事後話入。渠願於下屆在其地舉行車賽。范氏言此及一理想之跑道。每小時之速率應介於九十及百英里之間。最近愛爾蘭之汽車賽跑家數輩亦往共地勘察。柯克之市民及熱心車賽者均希望比賽塲之得以如期完成。市長法蘭去氏已被推為設計委會之主席。預期此賽塲作為公開比賽之用。並以一千鎊作為獎金。他日歐陸及英國之汽車賽跑家參加者定不乏人也。</p>
<h3>哈佛大學實驗　兩性駕駛汽車問題</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>證明男人優於女子</p>
<p>關於男女駕駛汽車。有人說女人比男人心細。所以技術特優。更不容易肇駕車技術來得進步。雙方各執一　。英衷一是。但這一次美國哈佛大學交通問題研究會的雪爾華博士。曾經把男女駕駛汽車。從兩性的心理上。技術上。作一度實地的考騐。結果據他說目前不拘任何年齡。合於理想的汽車司機人。遠是沒有。而事實上。大概女人的駕車技術。總是比不上男人。同時。研究會方面。更承認人類在自身方面。也有很多原因。足使汽車肇禍。而要减少這種禍案。唯一的方法就在從敎育方面入手。</p>
<p>雪爾華博士告訴我們。女人駕駛汽車。體力上的技巧。和心理上的靈感，都不及男人。而且敎導的時候。也沒有男人那麼容易。雖然二十歲以上的女子。敎她們開汽車是很便當的。但自二十五歲到三十歲的。恐怕竟難以學會了。就男人說來。在各種不同等的年齡之中。大概二十三歲左右的人。遇到危險。塞車最敏捷。像這樣的人。駕駛一輛汽車。突然看見前面要發生危險了。在百分之四十一秒的時間之中。立刻可以把車輛塞住。換句話說。他在每分鐘一哩的速率之下。在距離三十五呎的地方。可以塞車的。自二十三歲以上的人。塞車的動作。便要依照年齡而逐步减慢。另一面更知道十五到十六歲的孩子。塞車時動作很慢。的摸和自三十五歲至四十歲的人相仿。哈佛大學的道路專家。這次實騐兩性駕駛汽車的優劣。更不限於普通的汽車路。因為當開始實騐之初。司機的人在城市馬路之中。行駛了多時。竟難得遇到危險。因此。雪爾華博士。便採用各種實騐性質的工具。安置在馬路上面。使司機人立刻可遇到種種假作的危險。最重要的一種實騐。就在使司機人在一剎那的時間之中。同時能够處置駕駛盤。塞車。分合機和加速器。一個司機人。有了這種技術。駛車外出。在道路上面。什麼危險都不會發生了。</p>
<p>這次關於塞車的實騐。更是特別注意。以證最神速的方法是百分之幾秋內可以見到功效。自踏上加速板以至發見紅燈。立卽塞車為止。出乎意外。據說實騐結果。一個人飲了少量的酒之後。塞車反比普通的人敏捷。這當然是出於我們的意外的。雖然其他各種技術。飲酒之後。都要退步。祗有塞車却反見進步。在四，〇〇〇個司機人之中。考騐結果。平均塞車的時間。是百分之四十一秒。在每小時六十哩的速率之下。普通的司機人。都可在四十呎內。使車輛停住。最高的塞車紀錄。是百分之二十四秒。事實上一般的人。通常塞車的時候。發生反應。似乎還要慢一些。祗是考騐性質。所以特別快。終之。塞車的敏捷。一半要看經騐。一半也是天賦呢</p>
<p>關於婦女的駕駛汽車。這次加入考騐的也很多。據雪爾華博士所說。那麼女人駕車。比男人缺少正則。不過女人之中。駛車的時期愈長。改進的機會愈多。而男入自始至終。是這樣。中途未見進步的。男人的駕車技術。進步的時期。的經過十年之久。從此而後。便要退步了。大槪有二十五年的經驗之後。男女的駕駛技術。可說是相等了。如果以年齡和駕車技術核對起來。那麼十五歲以下者。技術非常劣等的。十五歲以後。進步就快。而自十七歲至二十歲。進步得更是神速。自五十五歲起。便開始退步。事實告訴我們。到達這個年齡而後。駕駛汽車。要格外小心了。至於這次實騐的時候。都用標準以上的汽車。而所過的道路。也都是很狹小的。</p>

After the central government clears up the situation in Guangdong this time, it will also definitely reorganize Guangzhou's municipal administration. President Chiang, when summoning him in Lushan, also instructed him to thoroughly reorganize after taking office.

Currently, there are many bureaus under the Guangzhou Municipal Government, and he has decided to start by abolishing bureaus and establishing sections. Generally, he plans to merge the Education and Social Affairs Bureaus, and the Public Works and Public Utilities Bureaus.

<h3>The Possibility of Mediating the Guilin Situation</h3>
<p>— Gao</p>
<p>Since Chen Jitang was dismissed and went to Hong Kong, and Yu Hanmou returned to Guangdong, the Guangdong situation has implicitly come to an end. However, Li and Bai in Guilin are still unwilling to accept their orders. We, with the lingering fear of being startled birds, and apprehensive that the difficulties are not yet over, are constantly worried and find it difficult to be relieved. When the central government explicitly ordered Li to enter Beijing and appointed Bai as the head of Zhejiang, and ordered Huang Shaoxiong to be responsible for pacifying Guilin Province, the atmosphere suddenly became tense again. Rumors of upheaval spread like dust. The Guilin army mobilized to peek at Qinlian. The Guangdong fleet was ordered to open the West River. British and American ships sailed to Wuzhou to protect overseas Chinese. Guilin generals established an autonomous government. The rumors spread as if the turmoil could not be avoided in the end. In today's world situation, can there be a time for internal strife? This principle is very clear and understood by everyone. Unless they have other intentions, who would be willing to be the instigator of conflict? However, for months, we have exhausted our voices and energy in appealing for peace and praying for unity, but the result is still such an ominous situation. At this point, what else can be said?</p>
<p>However, according to recent news, mediating the current crisis does not seem to be completely hopeless. The Guilin army stationed in Wuzhou has already begun to withdraw. The so-called autonomous government has not yet materialized. And Chairman Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed Li and Bai, advising them to accept their new positions, with sincere words and detailed analysis, which should be sufficient to prove that this cloudy and chaotic situation will eventually be cleared up and brightened. The root of this change lies in the fact that the arrival of Li and Bai's telegram accepting the order coincided with the central government's issuance of the new order. From this, suspicions accumulated and doubts arose. Li and Bai believed that the central government had other intentions, while the central government believed that Li and Bai deliberately resisted orders. A slight error led to a great discrepancy. What a pity!</p>
<p>According to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's telegram, it became clear that the central government's change of previous orders was actually to take into account Li and Bai's actual difficulties. Therefore, it wanted to open up another way out. Since Li and Bai planned to take office at a certain time, why is it difficult to accept the new position afterwards? All the formation of disputes is nothing more than emotional agitation. Now that this matter has been explained clearly, then the so-called increasing defenses, building fortifications, and frequent troop deployments are nothing more than self-disturbances of ordinary people, and in fact, there is nothing worth the ridicule of the informed.</p>
<p>Objectively speaking, Li and Bai's achievements in governing Guilin are obvious to all. Zhejiang Province is known as a scenic area and greatly desires talented people to govern. This time, the central government's appointment of Bai as the head of Zhejiang, in order to adapt to local conditions and expand its great effectiveness, was originally a measure that should have been taken into account. But Li and Bai inevitably had hesitations and suspicions, which was caused by excessive separation in the past. When ordinary people have a misunderstanding, it gradually turns into something unexpected. How can those who bear the burden of local responsibility allow themselves to make a desperate gamble? The way to eliminate and resolve disputes lies in being open and honest, and mutually revealing one's heart. Judging from the sincerity of the words in Chiang's telegram, it should be enough to persuade the other party to listen and see. It is also heard that Chiang will personally go to Guangdong to meet with Li and Bai for a frank discussion. This is an insightful move to overcome obstacles and obtain the pearl from the depths. Turning hostility into friendship and laying the foundation for unity will all be seen in Chiang's trip.</p>
<h3>Li Tonghua Arrives in Tianjin – Investigating Road Transportation and Smuggling</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Li Tonghua, deputy director of the Anti-Smuggling Investigation Department, came to Tianjin and is scheduled to go to Beiping on the 6th to investigate the PingSui and PingHan railways. He has already met with Xu Liya, the chief of the Tianjin Customs, on the 4th to exchange opinions on road transportation and smuggling suppression. He plans to meet with Chen Juesheng in a private capacity on the 5th to discuss matters related to Beining Railway assisting in smuggling suppression. An inspection branch has been set up in Dezhou on the Jinpu Railway. After Li's investigation, he will suggest that inspection branches should also be set up on the Jiaoji and PingSui railways. Ansi Er will come north this month to discuss this matter. According to Li's investigation, smuggling on Jinpu Railway passenger cars has disappeared, and although there are occasional small batches on freight cars, it will soon be eliminated. Smuggling is now developing towards the Northwest, and setting up an inspection branch on the PingSui Railway cannot be delayed. The situation on the PingHan Railway is particularly good, and there is no smuggling via passenger cars. (4th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Resignation of Governor-General of Korea, Ugaki – Decided to be Succeeded by Minami Jiro</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Governor-General of Korea, Ugaki Kazushige, and the Director-General of Political Affairs, Imai Kiyotoku, tendered their resignations. After being approved by today's regular cabinet meeting, it was decided that Minami Jiro will succeed as Governor-General, and Ohno Ryokuichiro will succeed as Director-General of Political Affairs. Prime Minister Hirota left Tokyo for his villa in Hayama at 1:30 PM today to meet the Emperor, who is vacationing there, to report everything and request approval. (4th Hua Lian Electric)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Ugaki Kazushige, Governor-General of Korea, resigned and it was decided that General Minami Jiro would succeed him. The Director-General of Political Affairs of the Governor-General's Office will be taken over by Ohno Ryokuichiro.</p>
<p>General Minami entered Beijing by electric train from his Kamakura residence at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. The Army Department generally expressed approval of General Minami's appointment as Governor-General of Korea. From the perspective of national defense, it is most appropriate for General Minami, who has recently retired from active service and is proficient in all matters, to be the Governor-General. Moreover, before retiring from active service, General Minami served as the commander of the Kwantung Army and ambassador to Manchuria, and is proficient in matters related to Korea and Manchuria. This point alone is highly anticipated by all parties.</p>
<p>General Minami Jiro was born in August of Meiji 7th year to Minami Kihei, a samurai from Oita Prefecture. He is 63 years old this year. He graduated from the cavalry department of the Army Officer Academy in Meiji 28th year. Afterwards, he was promoted several times. In March of Showa 5th year, he was promoted to Army General. In April of Showa 6th year, he entered the Wakatsuki Cabinet as the Minister of the Army. He resigned in December of the same year and became a military councillor. When General Hishikari Takashi resigned as commander of the Kwantung Army, he succeeded him and took office in Manchuria. Later, due to the February 26th Incident, he deeply regretted his responsibility as an elder of the army and resigned from his position as commander of the Kwantung Army until now. (4th Allied News Agency Electric)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since Ugaki Kazushige and Imai Kiyotoku, the Director-General of Political Affairs of Korea, took office in Korea in Showa 6th year, they have been diligently working hard to govern Korea, so their six years of service have been remarkable. At the time of their courageous retirement, the government is considering methods of preferential treatment. However, Ugaki's contributions during the Manchurian Incident should also be considered, so he may be recommended for a peerage or awarded the Paulownia Flower Grand Cordon. For Imai, in consideration of his many years of service, he will be rewarded with Imperial appointment. Therefore, it will be realized before the winter parliament. (4th Allied Electric)</p>

<h3>Song Zheyuan Goes to Baoding to Attend Hebei Province Security Meeting and Inspect the 29th Army Troops Stationed There. Song Says His Trip to Jinan with Matsumuro Has No Special Mission</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan left Beiping this afternoon for Baoding, accompanied by Deng Zhexi, Director of the Military Law Department of the Pacification Headquarters, and Song Meicun, Director of the Staff Department. Song said that his trip to Baoding was to attend the closing ceremony of the security meeting convened by the Hebei Provincial Security Department, where he would give a special speech and take the opportunity to inspect the 29th Army troops stationed there. After staying in Baoding for a short time, he would go to the Hejian area to investigate the administration of various counties. He had not met with Nishida since he arrived in Beiping, and Wang Kemin's arrival in the north was not yet certain. There had been no recent diplomatic activities in North China, and Matsumuro's trip to Jinan was probably without any special mission. The construction plan for the Cangshi Road was under study and had been submitted to the Economic and Transportation Committees to draft a plan. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan said that his trip to Baoding had three missions: (1) The Hebei Provincial Security Department had convened local personnel to hold a defense meeting, and the 4th was the last day, so he was going to give a speech and provide instructions on everything; (2) to inspect the troops stationed in Baoding; (3) if time permitted, after finishing the matters in Baoding, he planned to go to Hejian and other counties to inspect the highways and conduct on-site investigations into the hardships of the people to provide relief. The date of his return to Beiping was undecided. He had not yet met with Nishida since he came to Beiping. Matsumuro's trip to Jinan was certain, but the mission was unclear. Wang Kemin had recently expressed pessimism in his letters, but he had sent a letter urging him to come. Whether he would come to Beiping immediately was still uncertain, but he very much hoped he would come to Beiping. The diplomatic negotiations for Hebei and Chahar had now been suspended. He believed that diplomatic matters should be the responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and diplomatic issues should be handled directly with the Ministry. The construction of the Cangshi Road was being studied by the Economic and Transportation Committees, and a concrete plan would soon be drafted. Song concluded by saying that China could not recover without revitalizing its spirit. Although the situation was difficult, it could not rely on others to seek national salvation. Therefore, he had always advocated leading by example and safeguarding national sovereignty. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Military Purges, Changes, and Coups D'état (III)</h3>
<p>— Jia He</p>
<p>Past history told Ugaki that to realize his long-cherished wish of many years, he had to remove the obstacles blocking his progress, that is, he had to purge the Araki faction. Minister of the Army Terauchi, bearing the public's expectation of cleaning up the "February 26th Incident," bravely placed the four great generals, Araki, Mazaki, Honjo, and Kawashima, into the reserve, and used the ordinance restricting the Minister of the Army to active-duty generals, cutting off any possibility of the aforementioned four great generals from making a comeback. Thereafter, every time he issued a list of changes, it made the Zaibatsu applaud: (1) The changes on March 23rd used the name of "bearing responsibility for the coup d'état" to insert his comrade, Kozo Kanro, as Vice Minister of the Army, giving the position to Umezu Mijiro, temporarily taking a backseat at the Aviation Headquarters. General Sugiyama Hajime avoided being the target of attacks and was transferred to the General Staff Headquarters, allowing the Chief of Staff, Nishio Juyo (Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army) from the central faction, to take the position. As for the officers who participated in the coup d'état, such as Major General Sato Shozaburo, they were all "placed on standby" (i.e., dismissed). The only one from the Araki faction who could be called proud that day was Okamura Yasuji, who was transferred from the Second Department Chief of the General Staff Headquarters to the Second Division Commander. (2) The changes on March 28th completed the unfinished work of the previous decision. He dismissed the direct superiors of the participating troops, such as the commander of the 1st Infantry Regiment, Colonel Koto Megumu, the commander of the 3rd Infantry Regiment, Colonel Shibuya Saburo, and the commander of the 3rd Guards Infantry Regiment, Colonel Sonoyama Mitsuzo, and other officers, a total of eleven people. The other 120 personnel who were changed were also lieutenant-colonel and below. (3) The changes on July 10th placed all the aforementioned personnel on standby into the reserve. Lieutenant General Komine Kohei (dismissed on April 2nd), the Tokyo garrison commander during the coup d'état, also suffered the same fate. Although there were Hashimoto Toranosuke (former commander of the Guards Division) and Hori Takeo (former commander of the 1st Division), who were close to Army Minister Hayashi, as foils, the Araki faction's strongholds, the 1st and 2nd Guards Divisions, were almost eradicated.</p>
<p>At the same time, the news that "the scope of the August changes is quite large" appeared in the newspapers. As expected, the number of people transferred, reassigned, and dismissed reached more than 3,000. Among them, the most important was Sugiyama Hajime, the main character in Army Minister Hayashi's military purge mentioned earlier. In addition to being appointed as a military councillor, he also replaced Nishi Yoshiichi (placed in the reserve) and was promoted to Director-General of Military Education, one of the three chiefs of the army. Although Lieutenant General Kishimoto Ayato advanced to the rank of general one step ahead of him (but was dismissed at the same time), every commentator predicted the date of Sugiyama's promotion to general. As a result, Lieutenant General Kozo Kanro, who had been slightly suppressed for a time, was transferred to the Director-General of the Army Aviation Headquarters, and Hata Shunroku, the former head of the Aviation Headquarters, was transferred to the commander of the Taiwan Army. Imai Kiyotake, who had been active on the personnel stage after his predecessor Nagata, was appointed as the commander of the 4th Division. The above people celebrating their promotion were all seen as people of the Ugaki system or quasi-Ugaki system. From this, we know that the central stage of the Japanese army today is mostly dominated by Ugaki.</p>
<p>On the other hand, let's look at Araki's lineup! Imai Kiyotake's position as commander of the 4th Division was originally for Tatekawa Yoshitsugu. Lieutenant General Tatekawa, like the president of the Veterans Association, General Suzuki Sojuro, was a senior cavalry officer and son-in-law of Major General Morioka Masayuki. After the Manchurian Incident, he gave speeches with Araki in resonance. It was unsuitable to have such a person stationed in Japan's "economic heart," the capital of the Kansai Zaibatsu, Osaka, everyone knew this. Now he and Lieutenant General Obata Toshishiro were placed in the reserve at the same time. Another person we want to talk about is the commander of the Taiwan Army, Yanagawa Heisuke. His friendship with Araki can be proven by the small matter of his eldest daughter Kazuko's marriage, which troubled the general and baron. Of course, private feelings are one thing, and public affairs are another. The two should not be confused, but Araki's favorite theorist, Date Ryujo, listed Lieutenant General Yanagawa as a member of Araki's camp. At a time when the southward advance was being loudly chanted, he was recalled to the central government (appointed to the General Staff Headquarters). This can explain to us that the work of "military purification" has reached from the central government to the colonies. If the "military purification" of the colonies is the most difficult, then Yanagawa's transfer can be regarded as the first signal, which is also unknown.</p>
<p>Studying the organization and power of the Japanese military is very interesting. In a country with such consolidated central authority, power is in the hands of the central government? There is no problem. However, the garrisons in places like Osaka and the colonies of Manchuria and Taiwan also occupy important positions. Some are recalled to the central government from the local area, increasing their power, and some are transferred out from the central government, weakening their power. We can use the familiar former Shanghai military attache, Lieutenant Colonel Kagesa Teiaki, as our illustration. On the day of his honorable transfer, he promoted the policies of the young and strong faction in the department with the qualification of "Manchuria-Mongolia class leader," but now he is transferred to the artillery 2nd regiment stationed in Sendai, giving us a feeling of promotion in name but demotion in fact.</p>
<p>According to the above facts, the work of "military purification" has indeed come to a fairly satisfactory end. What about "the overall renewal of governance"? The facilities of the Hirota Cabinet gave people great disappointment. Therefore, Army Minister Terauchi publicly declared on June 2nd: "The purification of the military department is closely related to the general renewal of governance and cannot be separated." (Yomiuri, 3rd), which was tantamount to a blow to Hirota. Early on July 26th, he (General Terauchi) went west to visit the Ise Grand Shrine and frankly expressed his dissatisfaction with the current cabinet to the press, saying with the qualification of "Minister of State": "The overall renewal of governance is the demand of the times. Ministers who cannot implement it should resign without hesitation, leaving behind ministers with vigor. As for myself, perhaps I belong to the weak, which is also unknown." (Daima). Was this hinting at using resignation to overthrow the cabinet? When he arrived in Nagoya in the afternoon, he replied, "I won't resign so easily" (ibid).</p>

<h3>The United States and the Philippines. Certain Island to be a Permanent Naval Base for the U.S.</h3>
<p>Washington, D.C. U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, Murphy, gave a speech here today, stating that the people of the Philippines are politically ready for independence, but economically, maintaining its stability is a serious practical problem. Mr. Murphy said that the Filipinos have sufficient legislative capacity, and praised President Quezon, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and other government officials for their competence and integrity, so he has great hope for the future of the Philippines. The people of the Philippines now need guidance and support, so they must remain under the jurisdiction of the United States for at least ten more years. (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the report from Consul General Uchiyama in Manila received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 4th, the Palawan Provincial Council of the Philippine Federation recently passed a resolution to request President Quezon to propose to the U.S. government that part or all of the province become an important base for the U.S. Navy and permanently belong to the U.S. The province is located in the South China Sea and is a military stronghold facing the Sulu Sea, with a total area of 4,500 square miles. It used to be a colony and fishing ground for American prisoners and occupies an excellent position. According to this resolution, it is hoped that the exception clause for naval bases in the Philippine Independence Act will be applied. Therefore, the voluntary abandonment of independence by the military stronghold of Palawan Island and its subjugation under the rule of the U.S. government is quite noteworthy from various points of view.

<p>(Washington) People here are discussing today that the recent cracking of two Japanese spy cases will have a considerable impact politically and diplomatically. Some military experts in the army and navy believe that the impact of the Thompson case and the Forbes case can be summarized as follows: (1) Warning other spies not to sell U.S. military secrets to foreign governments; (2) Indirectly warning Japan, meaning that the United States is capable of cracking down on spy cases that are more serious than these two cases. It is said that Thompson impersonated a navy man, and Forbes had been out of the navy for a long time, so neither of them could provide valuable information to foreign countries.

<h3>British Labour Party Leader Travels to Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>(London) Major Attlee, leader of the opposition Labour Party in Parliament, is scheduled to depart for the Soviet Union tomorrow. He claims that the trip is purely for travel, but he will also take the opportunity to study the general situation in the Soviet Union. (3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Two German Warships Cover Spanish Rebels, German Military Officers Visit Rebel Leaders, British and French Officials Quite Surprised</h3>
<p>(London) Officials here are quite surprised by the actions of the German pocket battleship Deutschland. The ship sailed to the port of Ceuta in Morocco, just as two Spanish government warships were engaged in battle with rebel batteries on the shore, making it impossible for them to effectively bombard the shore. News was also received that the officers of the Deutschland had been formally received by General Franco, the leader of the rebels, increasing the officials' concern. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The German 10,000-ton cruiser Deutschland and the destroyer Luchs arrived at the port of Ceuta in Spanish Morocco yesterday morning. All the officers of the warships went ashore to visit General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Spanish rebels. Responsible sources stated that the anchoring of German warships in the port of Ceuta was a common occurrence under the current system in Morocco and was not a recurrence of the Agadir Incident today (Editor's note: In 1910, Germany sent the cruiser Panther to the port of Agadir in Morocco to demonstrate to France. France and Germany subsequently concluded an agreement in 1911 to resolve the Moroccan question). However, the fact that the German warship commanders visited the Spanish rebel leaders showed that Germany, even if it did not directly interfere in Spanish internal affairs, at least publicly expressed sympathy for the rebels. This move was particularly unsettling. Whether the motive for the visit was to discuss the repatriation of German refugees or due to international courtesy was currently unknown. Since no countries have recognized the rebel leaders, the so-called "courtesy" must also have a special meaning. (4th Havas Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tangier, Morocco Special dispatch from our correspondent Regarding the German warship's arrival at the port of Ceuta, the Spanish rebels had received the news several days before. According to a key figure in diplomatic circles, "The visit of the German warship commander to the rebel leader, General Franco, is the most serious matter. Although those around Franco say that this move was only a courtesy exchange, in reality, the conversation lasted for more than an hour, and the rebels also clearly regarded this action of the German warship as an expression of sympathy for them." Also, when the rebel officers accompanied the German warship officers to tour the port of Ceuta this morning, they were all smug and showed it on their faces, which is also noteworthy. (4th Havas Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Ceuta, Morocco The German 10,000-ton pocket battleship Deutschland and the German destroyer Luchs entered the port here this morning and were warmly welcomed. All the ships in the port fired salutes to pay their respects. General Franco, the leader of the Spanish rebels, received the German officers in the old palace. It was heard that the German warships came to protect German expatriates. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Leftist Figures from Various Countries Form Volunteer Army to Join the War; Fierce Fighting Across Spain</h3>
<p>Madrid - Fierce fighting continues across Spain between government troops and rebel factions, but the true situation is unclear. The rebel offensive against Madrid is in an unfavorable position. Although they maintain their position on the Guadalajara front line in the nearby mountains, it is evident that they are experiencing a shortage of supplies. After strong reinforcements from the government arrived from Valencia, they are about to advance on the rebels in the area. According to sources in Barcelona, more than two hundred leftist figures from various countries have formed a volunteer army, arrived from France, and offered their services to the government. Yesterday, sixteen government aircraft carried out a large-scale bombing of Zaragoza and key points on the Aragon front line, encircling and routing the rebel cavalry. It is reported that a large number of rebels have surrendered. Furthermore, according to sources in Biarritz, a French border town, two Spanish military aircraft, en route from Madrid to San Sebastian, landed here yesterday due to the pilots losing their way. The pilots have been detained by the French police. The aircraft are equipped with machine guns, carry a large quantity of ammunition, and government propaganda materials, and are currently being guarded by French forces. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>French Border - There is heavy fighting across Spain today. The battle of Oviedo is particularly fierce. Government forces have surrounded the entire city with landmines, effectively detaining all the rebels and 60,000 residents within. If the city falls, there will likely be a terrible massacre. The rebels are attempting to retake cities such as San Sebastian and Ronda, but the government forces have control of the coast and border, making their position difficult to shake. Government aircraft bombed the northern rebel forces today. The transatlantic aviator Loda has volunteered to serve the government. It is claimed that he bombed a train of rebel supply vehicles en route from Jaraguad to Valladolid, which then caught fire, causing many rebel casualties. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>Madrid - Cannon fire in the mountain passes north of Madrid has subsided slightly today, only to resume with greater intensity. A government force led by General Mengada has charged the rebel lines, intending to penetrate deep into enemy territory to allow the main force to advance. It is now reported that there is fierce hand-to-hand combat. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>Spanish Rebel Headquarters - After fearlessly engaging the government forces' machine-gun positions in hand-to-hand combat, the rebels have now captured the Guadalajara mountain pass.

After the rebel victory, their right flank has advanced to a superior position and can now link up with the central rebel forces in the Beitrage Valley, preparing to launch a new offensive. The rebels launched a surprise attack on the government forces in this battle, and by the time the government forces realized what was happening and returned fire, it was too late. Although hundreds of rebels were seriously injured and fell to the ground, the remaining troops continued to surge forward, engaging in hand-to-hand combat, which was resolved in a matter of minutes. The rebels captured fifty government soldiers. The number of government casualties is unknown. General De, a former adjutant to the deposed King Alfonso, arrived here today to take command of the rebel forces here. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Concerns in Parisian Diplomatic Circles Regarding Spain; Believe Germany and Italy's Attitudes are Suspicious</h3>
<p>(Paris) - Diplomatic circles here are very concerned about the situation in Spain. Although news came from that country last night stating that fierce fighting had broken out in the Guadalajara mountains north of the capital, the ultimate victor has yet to be determined. If this situation remains unchanged for a long time, it will inevitably have an impact internationally due to the different attitudes of various countries. This is a matter of great concern. According to diplomatic circles, the British government will likely give a satisfactory response today to France's proposal for a non-intervention agreement in the Spanish situation. On the Italian side, according to sources in Rome, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano met with French Ambassador Chambrun yesterday. People here were quite uneasy upon hearing this news, fearing that the Italian government would not be as eager as the British and French governments to establish a neutrality agreement. In addition, Italian newspapers have not said a word about the French ambassador's request, but instead criticized France for not helping the Madrid government, and pointed to the fact that Spanish gold is being shipped into Paris as proof of French aid to that government. As for the issue of Italian aircraft flying to Spanish Morocco, the Italian public has remained silent on the matter, and government officials have consistently stated that the investigation has not yet been completed. In light of all these factors, Italy's attitude is indeed concerning. Moreover, news from Germany is even more worrying. According to a telegram from Tangier, an international neutral port, the German cruiser "Deutschland" and the destroyer "Luchs" both arrived in Ceuta, Spanish Africa, at 9:00 AM yesterday. The commanders of the two ships immediately went ashore to visit General Franco, the leader of the Spanish rebels. The attitude of Germany in this action is very suspicious. Furthermore, according to news from Moscow, the people there held a gathering yesterday to express their solidarity with the Spanish workers in their struggle against the Fascists. At the same time, the rebel radio station in Spanish Ceuta broadcast a message claiming that the Soviet Union is indeed providing assistance to the Madrid government. All of this news makes people even more fearful. At this juncture, it is imperative that major countries seek a compromise on this issue to avoid the spread of disaster. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ministers of Railway and Finance Discuss Financial Issues</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) - After the cabinet meeting on the 4th, Railway Minister Maeda stayed behind at the Prime Minister's residence to meet with Finance Minister Baba for about an hour. He listened to the financial authorities' plans regarding the scope of tax increases and the limits on the issuance of deficit bonds. Then, the two ministers, Baba and Maeda, met with Prime Minister Hirota to exchange views on how to proceed with the national policy cabinet meetings, which have been suspended. As a result, the important national policies proposed by various ministries have already been collected, and the draft estimates for next year's budget will also be submitted to the Ministry of Finance by the various ministries before the 10th. Therefore, after Prime Minister Hirota and Finance Minister Shouma decide whether to adopt the national policy agreement after collecting the information, a decision can generally be made. Therefore, another national policy cabinet meeting will be held in late August. (Domei News Agency, 4th)</p>

<h3>Important Results of Solar Eclipse Observation by Soviet Scientists</h3>
<p>(Moscow, TASS, July 6) - The Soviet astronomical observation team obtained 150 photographs of the solar eclipse on June 19. The Polkovo observation team obtained extremely valuable red shell spectroscopic photographs at Akbulak, which clearly show the fine structure of the red shell, allowing for a detailed understanding of the upper layers of the solar atmosphere. In the past, the red shell was thought to be a continuous structure, but it has now been proven to be composed of numerous independent parts, shaped like small rivers. Previously, due to blurry photographs, these countless small rivers appeared to merge into one. These spectroscopic photographs will shed new light on the question of the nature of the solar atmosphere.</p>
<p>Secondly, the photography of the solar corona was a complete success. These photographs were taken using a special lens manufactured in the Soviet Union. The photography was conducted in five locations, from the North Caucasus to the Pacific coast. Therefore, Soviet astronomers obtained a large set of films, allowing them to understand in detail the changes in the solar corona during the two hours of the solar eclipse. These photographs were taken using the same method and can be compared to reveal the internal movement of the solar corona.</p>
<p>The study of radio wave emissions during the solar eclipse also yielded the most important results. The materials obtained reveal that the electrical guidance of the stratosphere, which helps ground-based radio wave broadcasting, is due to the power of sunlight ultraviolet radiation.</p>
<p>The above is only the most important result of the solar eclipse observation. The materials obtained through precise research in the future will greatly contribute to the study of the physical structure of the solar and the Earth's stratosphere.</p>

<h3>Italian Forces Suffer Another Setback in Abyssinia; Abyssinians Launch Attacks During the Rainy Season</h3>
<p>Port Said, Egypt - According to sources in Addis Ababa, Italian forces in Abyssinia recently suffered an unexpected setback.

In addition, on the eve of the Abyssinian uprising, many people sneaked into the city, hoping to provide internal support. After receiving the news, the Italian authorities immediately declared martial law and accused Abyssinian Bishop Peter of collaborating with the enemy.

At the same time, a unit of Italian motorized soldiers composed of loaded trucks was ambushed somewhere, all the trucks were destroyed, and 200 native soldiers were killed. Abyssinian clergyman Petro, whom the Italian authorities accused of collaborating with the enemy, was tried by a military court and immediately executed by firing squad. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<h3>Travelogue of Japan (11)</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Hu Zhongchi and Hu Yizang</p>
<p>While we were visiting the editorial department, Mr. Kamio, who was working, put down his pen and came over to greet us. He accompanied us into the editor-in-chief's office. This room was connected to a large hall, with several desks placed in the corners and a large oval table in the center, surrounded by many chairs. The executives of the Asahi Shimbun often gathered there to discuss editorial policies.</p>
<p>Mr. Kamio introduced us to the editor-in-chief, Mr. Harada Jozo. We sat down at the large table, eating ice fruit while talking with Mr. Harada. This kind and elderly man with thick eyebrows and a short beard inspired our respect with his earnest attitude and erudite conversation. We asked him about news editing techniques. In addition to receiving various helpful instructions, we were also honored to receive his book, "The Talk of News." Perhaps because our surname was Hu, he asked about Dr. Hu Shih of our country. We were ashamed that after so many years in the news industry, we had not yet met this master of the New Literature enlightenment era. From Harada's question, we couldn't help but think that Dr. Hu, at least in the eyes of foreigners, was still a representative of the Chinese intellectual class in the new era. Therefore, we must urge him to publish his political views more cautiously. Seeing his recent articles, it seems he has revised his original, somewhat inappropriate political thoughts, which is relatively gratifying.</p>
<p>While we were talking with the editor-in-chief Harada, the president of Asahi Shimbun, Ueno Seiichi, the chairman of the board, Murayama Zenkyo, and the chief editor, Kogen Misao, walked into the editor-in-chief's office through a side door. Mr. Kamio introduced us to each of them. Ueno and Murayama, the two big bosses of the Asahi Shimbun, were both wearing black suits, showing their high status. President Ueno, who is now 51 years old, looked older than his actual age because of his slightly bald head. The expression on his smiling, reddish, jujube-shaped face showed that he was not only a brilliant businessman but also an outstanding politician. Murayama and Kogen both had short beards and looked older than Ueno. We exchanged greetings with several key figures of the Asahi Kingdom. During the greetings, Murayama asked us the following questions:</p>
<p>"If I were to go to your country now, would your people genuinely welcome me?"</p>
<p>"If you were to visit our country, Mr. Murayama, our news industry would certainly welcome you sincerely. However, if you mean to test the feelings of the entire nation, it seems it is still a bit early."</p>
<p>"Then are you saying that such a time will never come?"</p>
<p>Afterwards, we asked Kamio about the history of the Asahi Shimbun. According to him, the Osaka Asahi Shimbun was founded in Meiji 12 (1889) by Murayama Ryuhei. Initially, it published only one sheet per day on a very small scale. In Meiji 14, it received financial assistance from Ueno Riichi, and under their joint management, the number of pages increased and sales also increased greatly. In Meiji 21, it acquired the Tokyo Mezame Shimbun and reorganized it as the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun. As a result, its business continued to develop, eventually reaching a circulation of over two million (combined for the Osaka and Tokyo editions). Ueno Riichi and Murayama Ryuhei were the fathers of the current president and chairman of the board. Statues of them are erected at the top of the stairs outside the editorial department. Mr. Kamio accompanied us there to pay our respects. We then bid farewell to the hosts gathered in the editor-in-chief's office and declined Mr. Kamio's banquet repeatedly, leaving the Asahi Kingdom.</p>

<h3>Japanese Advisor to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. The Mission of Assuming the Post of Hebei-Chahar Advisor is to Seek Happiness for the People of North China</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The newly hired Japanese advisor to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, Nishida Koichi, arrived in Tianjin yesterday and will soon go to Peiping to take office. Recently, Nishida met with reporters at the Yamato Hotel in the Japanese Concession. According to him, "I accepted the invitation of the Hebei-Chahar authorities. After arriving in Tianjin, I originally intended to go to Peiping as soon as possible, but I have been delayed because the negotiations here have not been completed. I have already found a residence in Yangrou Hutong, Dongcheng, Peiping. I plan to go to Peiping alone on the 3rd. My family will stay in Tianjin temporarily. After I arrive in Peiping, I will arrange and renovate the interior of the residence. I will return to Tianjin again after staying for one day. I plan to bring my family to Peiping on the 6th, and then visit Chairman Song Zheyuan to formally take office. I came to China after the Russo-Japanese War. I first worked at the Fushun Island Coal Mine, and then came to North China. In between, I traveled around Europe and America for more than a year. After returning, I went to Peiping again to serve as a secretary at the embassy. Before two years had passed, I transferred to Jinan, and so on until now. I have been in China for a total of eight and a half years, which is only six months short of the saying 'nine years facing the wall.' My main mission in assuming the post of Hebei-Chahar advisor is to assist Chairman Song in seeking happiness for the society and people of North China, and to promote mutual assistance and mutual benefit between China and Japan. The cooperation and co-prosperity of China and Japan will certainly not only benefit China or only benefit Japan. Therefore, I am determined to strive for mutual benefit and reciprocity to seek the welfare of the people of China and Japan."</p>
<p>Chen Juesheng, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, was very pleased with the arrival of the new Hebei-Chahar Political Council advisor, Nishida Koichi, who was an old friend. Yesterday afternoon at 7 p.m., he specially hosted a banquet at the Beining official residence on Haihe Road in the Special District One to welcome him. He also invited Consul General of Tianjin, Tajiri Aiyi, and Consuls Nishida and Nagai to attend. The atmosphere was very friendly and convivial. (August 2nd)</p>
<h3>A General Overview of Chahar Province's Politics: Extremely Dire Finances, Depressed Commerce, and the Chahar North Issue is Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>Zhangjiakou Correspondence: Since taking office, Liu Ruming, Chairman of the Chahar Provincial Government, has strived to improve the politics of Chahar Province. He has put forward four policies as the foundation for his administration: safeguarding public security, purging officialdom, strictly prohibiting the Communist bandits, and fostering friendly relations. He has been coping with everything in a difficult environment in the past month and has done a good job. However, the only difficulty in Chahar Province at present is the financial problem. The financial revenue of Chahar Province has always relied on tax revenue as the only source, with local land tax being secondary. Zhangjiakou is the throat connecting trade with Mongolia's Kulun. In previous years, the annual revenue of the Zhangduo Customs was more than one million yuan. Zhangjiakou's commerce was prosperous, and local tax revenue was also considerable. Since the Mongolian issue occurred, trade between Kulun and Zhangjiakou has ceased. Not only has tax revenue been cut off, but Zhangjiakou's commerce has also been greatly affected. In addition, the six counties of Chahar North have successively been abandoned, reducing land tax revenue by one-third. The total annual land tax of the sixteen counties of Chahar Province is more than three million yuan. It is now estimated that this year's revenue will be less than two million yuan, and the indirect huge losses are not included. When Liu Ruming took office as chairman, it was after the upper and lower levels had been busy with collection, and there was no land tax revenue. Moreover, the financial deficit was more than 300,000 yuan, and the situation was difficult to cope with. Therefore, there is almost no financial budget in Chahar Province at present. He only adopts austerity policies and strives to reduce expenditures. He is working hard to support himself without any other way. However, he is still striving to do what he can for local construction. The new construction of the Dayang River Xuanyang Bridge cost more than 30,000 yuan. He is also striving to improve education funding. This year, he also increased education funding by 4,000 yuan for the purpose of adding high school classes. The garrison in Chahar Province, in addition to the 143rd Division of Liu, which is directly under the 29th Army and whose military pay is allocated by the central government, there is also the Security Office, with monthly expenses of more than 30,000 yuan, and four local military brigades, with monthly expenses of 130,000 to 140,000 yuan. The two items total 170,000 yuan, all of which rely on local revenue to maintain.</p>
<p>After the six counties of Chahar North outside the pass, Zhangbei, Guyuan, Kangbao, Baochang, Shangdu, and Duolun, and the three administrative bureaus of Chongli, Shangyi, and Huade were abandoned, news was cut off, and very few outsiders knew the whole truth. The traffic between Zhangyuan and the six counties of Chahar North is now only operated by four Japanese-owned automobile companies: Wenlin, Donglu, Zhangduo, and Dabeit, The vehicles that travel back and forth are very strictly inspected and, other than merchants, it is difficult for other people to pass through. According to news obtained here, the Mongolian puppet government, which claims to have three armies, is actually no more than 10,000 people. Li Shouxin is the puppet Minister of Military and Political Affairs, with 2,000 troops under his command. Wang Daoyi serves as the border defense commander, also with about 1,000 troops. It is heard that Zhao Kuige, Wang Zixiu, and other miscellaneous soldiers from Shandong are all serving in Wang's troops. It is heard that the Mongolian puppet government is located in Jiabusi Temple and is expanding its forces, organizing airplane teams, machine gun teams, and tank teams, so the future is not optimistic.</p>
<p>After the abandonment of the six counties of Chahar North, a few miles outside Dajingmen in Zhangjiakou is someone else's sphere of influence. Fortunately, the market in Zhangjiakou is as peaceful as usual, and the people are still living in peace. Every day, Taiping Park, Forest Park, Zhongshan Park, and other places are crowded with tourists, but the market commerce is unusually depressed due to the influence of the current situation. According to the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Wang Daoxiu, and the Standing Committee Member, Wang Guitang, there are 3,300 businesses in Zhangyuan. 2,300 to 400 have joined the Chamber of Commerce, and more than 1,000 have not. The main commodities are fur and grain. In the past, when Chahar Province and Mongolia's Kulun had normal trade relations, Zhangjiakou's trade volume was more than 50 million yuan. Now, business has plummeted and is less than 30 million yuan. Moreover, eight or nine out of ten merchants have suffered losses, and they are crying out in pain. Some cannot help but feel sad about the past and present. The population of Zhangjiakou is over 100,000. The number of Japanese residents is increasing daily, reaching 300. The number of Russian residents is decreasing, and there are only 40 to 50 left. Both Japan and Russia have consulates in Zhangjiakou, and the Japanese military also has a special agency in Zhangjiakou. Mongolians also often travel between Mongolia and Zhangyuan. In addition, a part of Manchus live in Zhangyuan's Shangdongying and Xiadongying.</p>
<p>Liu Ruming, Chairman of the Chahar Provincial Government, was previously ordered by the central government to concurrently serve as a member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. He specially went from Zhangjiakou to Peiping to take office, attended the regular meetings of the Political Council, and met with Chairman Song Zheyuan to report on the political situation in Chahar Province and ask for instructions. He has now completed his official duties and took the private carriage attached to the Pingsui Railway 303rd train from Peiping to Baotou on July 31 to return to Chahar. He arrived in Zhangyuan at 0:05 early on the 1st of this month. (1st)</p>
<h3>Under Japanese Control, Actively Developing Rehe's Industry. Abundant Raw Materials, the Japanese are Very Satisfied. Promoting Military Industrialization Aims at Russia</h3>
<p>Chengde Correspondence: Since the Japanese forcibly occupied Rehe, they have conducted detailed investigations into various agricultural and mining industries, and have actively developed them. Recently, they have conducted more detailed investigations into Rehe's industry. According to the Japanese announcement, although there are as many as 594 factories in Rehe Province, their total capital is only more than 692,000 yuan. The Japanese believe that this kind of small-capital industry needs to be controlled and improved, so that when conflicts occur with Outer Mongolia and the Soviet Union in the future, they can be manufactured nearby in the military industry for supply. This is the only purpose of the Japanese. The number of factories and workers in Rehe, as well as the amount of capital and output, are listed separately below:</p>
<p>Most of the above factories are in the scope of handicrafts. According to the Japanese, if Rehe's industry is developed and a special agency is formed for the puppet Xing'an Province, it will definitely be greatly developed. In addition, the position of the puppet Xing'an Province and Jinre can be determined. The Japanese also analyzed and statistically analyzed the industrial conditions of each county in Rehe Province as follows:</p>
<p>According to the above counties, the most developed industrial areas are Chifeng and Chengde. Chengde's leather industry is better than other places, so Chengde's leather industry has reached 26 factories. Leather is also one of the military industries, and the Japanese are very satisfied with it. Chifeng's industries, such as wool weaving, dyeing, pharmaceuticals, and winemaking, are developing as a whole. In the future, with the decision of the Japanese-planned Rehe economic policy, the prosperity of industry can be expected, as the Japanese boast. The development of Chifeng's gold refining plant is one example. In addition, the mining of natural soda, the production of saltpeter, and the basketry near the enclosure are all listed as special industries. Among them, many provide subsidies for the military industry. According to Japanese investigations, the main special industries in Rehe are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Chengde's Nanmu industry: 3 factories, 15 workers, 140 yuan in capital, and 3,950 yuan in output.</p>
<p>(2) Lingyuan's gunpowder manufacturing: 2 factories, 15 workers, 400 yuan in capital, and 1,200 yuan in annual output.</p>
<p>(3) Chifeng's dyeing industry: 10 factories, 223 workers, 11.0 yuan in capital, and 76,150 yuan in output.</p>
<p>(4) Chifeng's pharmaceutical industry: 5 factories, 50 workers, 8.836 yuan in capital, and 41,000 yuan in annual output.</p>
<p>(5) Longhua's dyeing industry: 3 factories, 10 workers, 400 yuan in capital, and 2,850 yuan in annual output.</p>
<p>(6) Fengning's felt carpet industry: 3 factories, 10 workers, 1,190 yuan in capital, and 12,000 yuan in annual output.</p>
<p>(7) Luanping's pharmaceutical industry: 5 factories, 22 workers, 1.090 yuan in capital, and 600 yuan in annual output.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: The Magistrate of Piyun Town is Found Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Ding Shlong, the magistrate of Piyun Town in the First District, was ordered to handle the registration of opium addicts for self-reform, and he was quite conscientious. He was commended by the county government for his efforts. However, afterwards, Wang and Xu, claimed that their husbands had been detained for opium cases and that Magistrate Ding had been suspected of fraud. They filed a complaint with the provincial government, which ordered the county to investigate. The county government, on the grounds that the case involved fraud, sent it to the Songjiang District Court for investigation. The court found Magistrate Ding Shlong guilty and sentenced him to six months in prison. Afterwards, Magistrate Ding felt that he had made enemies with people for handling opium cases and that he had been framed. He was not satisfied with the verdict and hired lawyer Zhu Shaowen to appeal to the Suzhou High Court. After two hearings, he presented various counter-evidences. The debate ended on the 25th of last month. It has recently been learned from Suzhou that the High Court has overturned the original verdict against Ding Shlong.</p>
<h3>Kunshan: Bandits Rob and Injure People in Nanwaitan</h3>
<p>Zou Yuqing, the head of the first bao and ninth jia in Nanwaitan Village, Xinhui Township, District Eight of this county, is a farmer. Because his family is well-off, he was coveted by bandits. At about 11 p.m. on the 1st of this month, more than ten bandits suddenly came, broke into Zou's house with weapons, first tied up Yuqing and his sons and nephews, and then rummaged through the boxes and chests. They stole more than 200 yuan in cash and clothes and jewelry. However, the bandits were still not satisfied and forced them to say where the silver was hidden. They also struck Yuqing's chest with wooden objects, causing him serious injuries. The bandits then left. That night, the bandits went to the house of Rong Xiangsheng in the same village to rob property, but fortunately they did not injure anyone. After the bandits left, Yuqing was dying. He lingered until dawn on the 2nd and then died. After the county government was telegraphed for inspection, the body was coffined and buried.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Arresting the Principal Offender in the Murder Case</h3>
<p>In the case of Ji Xia, the wife of Ji Zhongyuan of Lindun Road, being murdered by her lover, Yin Amao, near the Su-Kun Highway outside Qimen, Yin Amao fled without a trace. The police precinct arrested a suspect, Chen Gaisheng, in Wuxi and sent him to the district court for investigation. Because there was insufficient evidence of a crime, he was given a decision not to prosecute. According to a report from the family of the victim to the Public Security Bureau here, the real murderer, Yin Amao, has been arrested by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau. They have requested that he be brought back. On the 4th, a document was prepared and personnel were dispatched to Shanghai to bring him back to be interrogated and dealt with.</p>
<h3>Business Community Strictly Cracks Down on Smuggled Goods</h3>
<p>The business and industry groups in Suzhou are sparing no effort in handling the prevention of smuggled goods. The County Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, and the trade associations of Chinese and foreign cloth, silk weaving, and North-South goods have all organized anti-smuggling committees to strictly prevent smuggling. The County Chamber of Commerce believes that there are many difficulties in the actual procedures for implementing the "Measures for the Detailed Investigation and Clearance of Local Goods Made of Artificial Silk or Mixed with Artificial Silk" formulated by the Ministry of Finance. As it concerns anti-smuggling, representatives of the relevant industries and the Suzhou Customs Commissioner will be convened in the coming days to hold a meeting to discuss the matter. The anti-smuggling committee of the General Labor Union has assigned a large number of patrol officers to carry out inspections of smuggled goods, and on the 4th, it sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau, ordering all branches to assist the patrol officers in performing their duties in order to achieve results.</p>
<h3>Water Police Arrests Two Notorious Bandits</h3>
<p>Recently, robberies have been frequently reported in Su Township. It has been learned that the reconnaissance team of the Second Water Public Security District arrested three notorious bandits, including Liu Er from Jiangbei, on the morning of the 4th on the shore of Yangcheng Lake. They also seized a pistol and stolen goods. They were immediately escorted to the team headquarters for interrogation. After an interrogation, they confessed to having many accomplices. The team immediately dispatched personnel to arrest the remaining members of the gang. It is heard that the bandits are related to the robbery case in Weiting Township and are currently being interrogated.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Handling Household Registration Changes</h3>
<p>Chen Yuchu, director of the Public Security Bureau of this county, recently stated that it is an essential factor in compiling baojia (neighborhood watch) that residents of each bao should issue a joint guarantee pledge, in accordance with the baojia laws and regulations. However, the investigation and reporting of household registration changes in the First District have been going on for several months, and there have been many changes in the residents' household registrations. The original joint guarantee pledge should be corrected as soon as possible to conform to the purpose of compiling and investigating baojia. However, the procedures for this matter are very cumbersome. It was submitted to the police affairs meeting for discussion and it was decided that each branch should conscientiously handle the matter in accordance with the joint guarantee pledge method. The joint guarantee pledge will be issued by the bureau.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Land Tax Record Office</h3>
<p>The County Government Land Tax Office previously had cases of stealing and colluding, involving many people, who were arrested separately, resulting in a major case. The county government is currently investigating, and the truth will soon come out. It is learned that Fang Guoding, the director of land tax, in view of the previous mistakes of laissez-faire and negligence, is trying to mend the fold. He has reorganized the collection office in a strict manner, merging the Yigui record room and the Yigui silver cabinet, and establishing three new shares: record checking, record management, and collection. Chen Bomiao was appointed as the head of the record checking share, Zhang Qiliang as the head of the record management share, and Zhu Songhuan as the head of the collection share. Deng Jiqian was transferred to the record checking share as a member, and Qian Bingqiu was transferred to the record management share as a member. Other staff members were slightly adjusted. For the sake of serious duties, each of the three heads was ordered to provide a written guarantee of 50,000 yuan, and each of the three members was ordered to provide a written guarantee of 5,000 yuan. The previous record checking room and silver grain cabinet were abolished.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Summer Practices Autumn Orders Harming Cotton and Rice</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, it has been the Great Heat, and now it is the middle of the three hot periods. However, heavy rains have fallen from time to time, and the climate is as cool as autumn, resulting in poor development of morning crops, especially the cotton in the sandbar. It is most affected, because it is the time of flowering and fruiting. In addition, epidemics are prevalent, and people suffer from various diseases such as summer dampness and warm evil. If the sky does not clear up again, the autumn harvest will be inferior, and the farmers are worried.</p>
<h3>Danyang: Chief of Education Bureau Gambles at Home</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Public Security Third Branch received reports from Xu Zhiben, Zhong Meiwu, and others that there was gambling and commission charging in Qin Manyuan's house in Wang Xiaozi Temple, No. 8, Jia 9, Bao 1, Siqian Town. Officer Pan, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered police chief Zhao to lead many police officers to the address to make arrests. Gamblers Qin Zhefu (i.e., Qin Manyuan, Director of the Education Bureau), Gao Lingxiao (i.e., Gao Duanyun, Principal of Quanzhou Primary School), Chen Zhaozhi (reportedly Chen Shizhang of the Education Committee), and Lu Zinan were arrested on the spot, along with gambling paraphernalia. After an interrogation by Officer Pan, on the grounds that the case involved gambling, he intended to transfer it to the General Bureau for verification. Zhang Ya, the district chief of the First District, went to intercede for bail and release, pending summons for legal action. It is heard that the original reporters, Xu Zhiben and others, have formally filed a lawsuit with the county government.</p>
<h3>Luhe: Brother Killing Case Has Been Verified</h3>
<p>In Chliuliu Township in the Fourth District of this county, Chen Guochen, the fourth son of Chen Jichu, a local villager, had a long-standing feud with his third brother, Guofan. He took advantage of the opportunity to work in the wheat field a few days ago and killed Guofan with an axe, dividing the body into eight pieces and burying them. The wife of the deceased, Liu, heard the news and intended to go to the county to appeal, but was suppressed by her father-in-law, Chen Jichu, who sent people to monitor her, preventing her from taking action. Chen Mingluan, the head of the township, received a bribe of 50 yuan and did not come forward to report the matter, mutually concealing the crime. The county government learned of the matter through inquiries and immediately dispatched police to secretly summon the witnesses in this case for interrogation. The murderer, Chen Guochen, initially refused to admit it. However, as the interrogation continued into the night, Yang, the interrogator, ordered the electric lights to be completely turned off. At that time, the sky was dark and it seemed as if there were ghosts crying and gods wailing. The murderer was frightened and confused, and then frankly confessed. Liu, in order to seek justice for her husband, also confessed the true circumstances of the murderer's killing, and requested that he be punished according to the law. Chen Mingluan, the head of the township, for daring to take a bribe and conceal a major case of human life, should be severely punished. He has been temporarily handed over to the guarantee of three substantial shops, pending further summons for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Anti-Smuggling Operations by Land and Sea</h3>
<p>The coastal and riverside areas of Nantong in Jiangbei have many remote, small ports where smuggling vessels frequently appear. They secretly transport goods inland for dumping. To protect the market, the various industry groups have formed an anti-smuggling committee. The Third District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police has dispatched the "Jun He" and "Hai Ying" police vessels to patrol the rivers and sea to intercept smuggling ships. On land, the Public Security Bureau is conducting investigations.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: Canal Water Level Rising</h3>
<p>Due to continuous rain in this county in recent weeks, the canal water level is rising daily as the Yi River flows into the canal. On the 2nd, the water level at the imperial pier was six feet eight inches (measured in construction feet). On the 3rd, it rose abruptly by one foot. According to the person in charge of the Jiangbao Section Office, although the water level is rising rapidly, there is no major concern at present. The county government has received an order from the provincial government to carry out flood prevention work and has formulated flood prevention measures for compliance.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Continued Collapse of the Jiangxu Riverbank</h3>
<p>Local figures in this county, such as Zhu Zhuxuan, concerned about the frequent collapses of the riverbank in the Jiangxu area, organized a committee to prepare for preventing further collapses. It is reported that the Jiangxu riverbank collapsed again yesterday, creating a dangerous situation. Upon hearing the news, the committee, represented by initiators Hu Xianbo, Dai Xingyi, Bao Xiangzhong, and Zhu Lizhun, crossed the river together on the 3rd to seek the agreement of gentry in Zhenjiang, such as Leng Yuqiu, Lu Xiaobo, and Yan Huiyu, so that Yangzhou and Zhenjiang can jointly appeal to the authorities to avoid further delays, which could pose a great danger to passengers traveling through Zhenjiang and Yangzhou. It is reported that the Yangzhou Progress Society also discussed this matter at length during a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday and unanimously agreed to cooperate in addressing the issue.</p>
<h3>Japanese Peddling Goods</h3>
<p>A private boat is docked at Yiling Town in the sixth district of Jiangdu, luxuriously decorated, carrying two Japanese who claim to be selling their country's "Jintan" medicine. The security team stationed in the town instructed the police to escort the boat. In addition to visiting various stores to peddle goods, the Japanese also painted advertisements on walls along the main roads. The workers were brought along with the boat. They stayed in Yiling for three days and left yesterday afternoon, heading east.</p>
<h3>Huaiyin: Public Security Bureau Arrests Opium Trafficker</h3>
<p>The head of the Huaiyin Public Security Bureau, Lin Gubiao, ordered the arrest of opium trafficker Zhang Nianxin, but he had not been apprehended. Although there was a tip that Zhang Nianxin was hiding in Kongmiao Town in the first district, a police search found no trace. Now, this trafficker was selling opium outside the Wangying Beiwei gate in the third district on July 30th, with twelve taels and five mace of opium in his possession. The public security police discovered this and immediately rushed to arrest him at his address. He was then handed over to the county government, which prepared a document along with the drugs and the suspect and sent them to the Sixth District Security Command for legal proceedings as a warning to others.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Several Days of Strong Winds and Rain</h3>
<p>Jiaxing has experienced several days of strong winds and rain, causing many boats to capsize in the rivers. The river water has risen several feet. In the countryside, the mid-season rice is at the stage of heading, and the rain has caused significant damage. The late rice has not been greatly affected. The early rice that has already matured but not yet harvested has been damaged by the wind and rain, with the rice ears submerged in water, causing them to sprout. Low-lying fields have been flooded due to the rising water. Farmers are now draining the water to salvage what they can for the harvest. In addition, a considerable number of other crops have been damaged by the wind and rain.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Plans to Build a Branch Line</h3>
<p>The Ministry ordered the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to construct a branch line from Zhangshu to Ganzhou. An engineering team led by engineer Wang Maoguan was dispatched to survey the route and has completed its work, returning to Hangzhou to report. It is understood that the line passes through the prosperous area of southern Jiangxi, from Zhangshu through Xingan, Xiajiang, Jian, Taihe, Wan'an, and reaching Gan County. The estimated length is over 310 kilometers, requiring an estimated construction cost of 21 million. The engineering work for this route is not particularly difficult. Funding is now being raised, and surveying is planned to begin soon. It is reported that Jian has a population of about 700,000 to 800,000, and Ganzhou has a population of 500,000, making the future business prospects promising.</p>
<h3>Panic Due to Shortage of Autumn Silkworm Eggs</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Province had a bountiful spring silkworm harvest this year, and the price of silk was quite high, so farmers are very enthusiastic about raising silkworms. The total demand for autumn silkworm eggs ordered by various counties in the province is 90,000 sheets.

<h3>Consular Corps Still Insists on Revising the Labor Inspection Agreement; Regrets Obstructing Our Sovereignty; Municipal Government Submits a Request to the Central Government; Negotiations Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>The unsettled case of factory inspection in the concession area of this city was settled by the municipal government and the Municipal Council through the "Agreement on the Implementation of the Factory Law in the Shanghai Public Concession" draft.

<h3>City Defense Corps Presents Plaque to Commander Yang</h3>
<p>The City Defense Corps, with its commander, deputy commander, and over forty members, led two teams of corps members to the Longhua Garrison Headquarters yesterday morning at 7:00 AM to respectfully present a plaque inscribed with "Commander Yang's Virtuous Governance." This was in recognition of Commander Yang's tireless efforts in reorganizing the City Defense Corps since his appointment as a standing committee member of the Shanghai Municipal Defense Committee in March of the 23rd year of the Republic, upon the invitation of Mayor Wu, during his tenure as Director of the Security Bureau. He frequently summoned comrades of the Defense Corps to the parade ground for motivational speeches, emphasizing that the current state of the nation was precarious and that national salvation and revitalization were only possible through universal awakening. He used the great spirit of the hardworking and meritorious Chairman Chiang Kai-shek as a model for us and encouraged us with three tasks: (1) The organization must be militarized; (2) Discipline must be militarized; (3) Technology must be militarized. He stated that if we could meet his requirements, the Shanghai Defense Corps would undoubtedly thrive and serve as a model for the entire nation. Everyone was greatly encouraged upon hearing this, and their spirits were lifted. Recalling the past, it was as if it were yesterday. We in the Defense Corps are all local people, and we not only appreciate his encouragement and urging but also rely on him for the maintenance of local security. For several years, although [missing character] has been pervasive, his awe-inspiring presence has been intangible. Therefore, we specially present this plaque inscribed "Virtue Attained, Authority Implemented" to express our gratitude. At noon on the same day, a public banquet was held in the East Hall of the YMCA for fellowship and celebration.</p>

<h3>State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Reorganization Report</h3>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company issued a report stating that since its reorganization, it has been making steady and tireless progress in reorganizing its business, equipping its ships, and rectifying its personnel. Its fundamental principle has been to maintain operations without neglect despite financial constraints. Although limited financial resources have prevented full-scale implementation over the past few months, gradual progress has been made and a preliminary foundation has been laid. Here is a report on the more important aspects and those that have already been implemented:</p>
<p>A. Business Reorganization</p>
<p>Reform of River Steamer System: Previously, all river steamers employed a comprador system with no restrictions on tickets, often exceeding cabin capacity by more than one or two times. Furthermore, vagrants and unruly soldiers mingled on board, smoking, gambling, and creating a chaotic scene. The ships lacked order, and hygiene was completely disregarded. Consequently, the treatment of steerage passengers on river steamers was almost inhumane. Each ship had usually one hundred and forty to fifty [tea] boys who were not paid wages. They relied entirely on privately selling bedding spaces and soliciting tips for drinks as compensation for their services. After purchasing tickets and boarding, steerage passengers had to buy bedding spaces from the tea boys to have a place to rest. Even the official cabins with fixed berths were often reserved in advance by those who extorted tips. The tip for drinks often amounted to more than thirty percent of the ticket price for long journeys and was even equal to the ticket price for short journeys, openly extorting money without any sense of shame. All of these shameful practices were unique to river steamers. Therefore, most travelers regarded river steamers as a long-distance [burden]. At the beginning of the reorganization, the company first implemented the elimination of these bad habits, uniformly replacing all ship compradors with business managers. Starting from April 1st, ticket offices were set up on the docks to sell tickets, and those without tickets were not allowed to board to prevent vagrants and unruly soldiers from mixing with the passengers. This also ensured that passengers arriving at the dock could purchase tickets without having to ask around. The number of tickets was limited to prevent overloading, ensuring that every ticket holder had a cabin space. Rules were established regarding the wages and drink tips of tea boys, prohibiting them from extorting fees from passengers. Furthermore, the New Life Movement Promotion Association dispatched members to reside on the ships and guide sanitation matters, which was widely praised as convenient. The company's passenger ticket revenue also significantly increased compared to before.</p>
<p>Abolition of Branch Offices: Due to financial difficulties, the company strived to conserve expenses. Branch offices or agencies in commercial ports where ships no longer sailed, such as the Chongqing Office and the Beihai Agency, have been abolished one after another. They will be restored in the future if ships sail to these ports again to avoid waste.</p>
<p>Suspension of the Inland River China Merchants Bureau: The Inland River China Merchants Bureau has consistently incurred losses over the years, and there have long been discussions about suspending its operations, but this had not been implemented. After the company's reorganization, permission was obtained to completely shut down, suspend navigation, and sell [assets]. The company is currently formulating detailed implementation measures in accordance with the Ministry's instructions.</p>
<p>Clearing Outstanding Debts for Passengers and Cargo: The company previously extended credit to various customers for cargo transport, sometimes exceeding the amount of the insurance policy, resulting in numerous store closures and significant losses. The recovery of debts was also difficult. After the company's reorganization, it formulated measures to restrict credit extensions while actively pursuing outstanding debts from various debtors or resorting to lawsuits in court to prevent excessive debt and facilitate clearing.</p>
<p>B. Ship Equipment</p>
<p>Installation of Radios and Amplifiers on All Ships: To ensure passenger safety, increase travel enjoyment, and facilitate the rapid transmission of navigation information, the company decided to install wireless radios and amplifiers on all river steamers to report the progress of the journey and broadcast music to entertain passengers at any time. The Xin Jiangtian and Jiang'an ships have already been properly equipped. The Jiangshun, Jianghua, and Haiyuan ships are currently being equipped. If the results are good, all ships will be equipped in succession in the future.</p>
<p>Installation of Ventilation Ducts on All Ships: To improve air circulation and sanitation in the third and fourth-class cabins, the company decided to install ventilation ducts on all ships, starting with a trial run on the Xin Jiangtian ship. The ventilation ducts on that ship have now been completed, and the Jianguo ship is also being equipped. It is planned to install them on the remaining ships in succession in the future. (To be continued)</p>

It has recently been learned that Li boarded the President Grant liner last night to return to Guangdong. The ship set sail this morning.</p>

<h3>German Leipzig Fair Welcomes China's Participation</h3>
<p>Fixed Office Established in Hong Kong, Held Biannually in Spring and Autumn</p>
<p>The German Leipzig Fair is held biannually in spring and autumn. To welcome the participation of Chinese manufacturers, the fair has established a fixed office in Hong Kong with the address Leipzig Fair (Hong Kong office), Hong Kong. Chinese manufacturers who wish to participate in the exhibition can send a letter to that office for inquiries. The Leipzig Fair originated in the twelfth century. In 1197, Emperor Maximilian granted it a national protection certificate and government preferential rights.

Every year, over ten thousand manufacturers from around the world participate in the exhibition, and two to three hundred thousand merchants from various countries visit the fair for procurement. Therefore, the Leipzig Fair truly possesses great value.</p>
<h3>Special District Citizens' Association Notifies Citizens to Participate in Civic Training</h3>
<p>Training Implementation Measures Determined, Urging Active Progress in All Districts</p>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' United Association, in order to assist the government in carrying out civic training in the special district, appointed preparatory personnel to be in charge. The association has now formulated measures for implementing the training and yesterday notified all district branches to actively proceed. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Notification of Training: The First Special District Citizens' United Association yesterday notified all district branches, stating that in view of saving the nation from disaster and revitalizing the nation, the association believes that it is dependent on citizens having strong physiques and a concept of loving the country. The weakness and decline of our country and the urgency of foreign aggression are largely due to the fact that our citizens are not yet healthy. Recently, the government authorities have been working hard to govern and are sparing no effort to promote public training, as they realize that a strong nation must first have strong people. The citizens of our special district are situated in the foreign concessions, and the environment is easily susceptible to adverse influences, making the implementation of public training particularly important. Therefore, the association established a civic training committee, formulated implementation measures, and resolved to notify all district branches to actively implement them. The implementation measures are enclosed. It is hoped that they will be implemented in order to strengthen the nation. The association also hopes that the progress of the implementation will be reported to the association. This notification is specially issued.</p>
<p>Implementation Measures: The First Special District Citizens' United Association's Measures for Implementing Public Training:</p>
<p>1. These measures are formulated in accordance with the Shanghai Municipal Civic Training Implementation Measures and the Group Training Measures.</p>
<p>2. Committee members of the association and committee members of various district branches, or non-members, who are between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five, may register to join.</p>
<p>3. The training period is three months.</p>

<h3>Grain Industry Requests Yard and Ministry to Salvage Wheat Outlets</h3>
<p>Advocating a Way Out</p>
<p>The previous report stated that the mainland flour mills association requested a ban on wheat exports. A reporter from Da Gong She (L'Impartial) specifically went to the Shanghai Grain, Oil, and Cake Industry Trade Association to solicit their opinion. According to the person in charge of the association, the tariff policies of various countries are determined by the domestic supply and demand situation. For example, if the domestic production of a certain commodity is excessive, not only will export taxes be exempted, but the government will also provide special incentives for foreign trade to maximize exports. If our country sincerely wants to save agriculture, industry, and commerce, what other way is there than tariff policy? This year, the national wheat harvest is abundant, and production is extremely high. There are currently over 300,000 bags of wheat in Shanghai warehouses, and most of the wheat is still in the hands of farmers and is not easily sold. Domestic demand is limited. If a way out is not sought for such a huge surplus, there will inevitably be a risk of spoilage, which will harm the rural areas and violate economic principles. The association, seeing this, specifically submitted a report to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Industry, requesting that measures be taken to salvage the situation. A copy of the submission is provided below: "Report on the fact that this year's wheat production exceeds demand, causing distress to both farmers and merchants, requesting that measures be taken to salvage the situation. The agricultural products of our country have always been dominated by rice and wheat. Since the imposition of import tariffs on foreign rice in 1933, the rural economy has gradually recovered. However, the rice harvest last autumn was abundant, and rice prices fell, which merchants already found painful, and farmers could not avoid being affected. This year's wheat harvest is abundant, the largest in recent years. Wheat production in various regions is extremely congested. Currently, Shanghai warehouses contain no less than 300,000 bags of wheat, and farmers who have not yet sold their wheat continue to ship it for export, seeking to sell it. The financial turnover is extremely hindered by such oversupply and huge surpluses. Merchants have to bear losses, and farmers cannot bear this either. The association believes that the price of domestic rice should be balanced as much as possible, and the outlet for wheat must be actively promoted. We hereby respectfully submit this report to the [Yuan] hoping that you will be mindful of the distress of farmers and merchants and quickly take measures to salvage the situation to avoid the risk of spoilage. We will be extremely grateful." Respectfully submitted to Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Executive Yuan, and Wu Dingchang, Minister of Industry, Shanghai Grain, Oil, and Cake Industry Trade Association, August 1, 1936.</p>

<h3>National Products Promotion Association Requests the Purchase of National Products</h3>
<p>If National Products Exist, Foreign Products Should Not Be Used and Reimbursed</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Promotion Association submitted a report to the Executive Yuan, stating, "Report requesting a reaffirmation of the government's previous order to purchase national products. If national products exist, foreign products should not be used and reimbursed." Ever since the opening of trade, the national industry of our nation, through the promotion and supervision of the government and the efforts of the people, has gradually taken shape after years of accumulation. However, the economic aggression of foreigners is all-encompassing. Initially, they competed with our young industry and commerce with their superior capital and exquisite goods across the sea. Later, when we raised tariffs and increased costs, they used unequal treaties as a shield, relying on their financial and intellectual resources to establish factories in the commercial ports of our country. Not only were they subject to the same taxes and levies as our national products, but they also relied on the special forces of the concessions to refuse to pay some or all of the taxes. With this superior position, their competition with our industry and commerce was invariably advantageous. This is the biggest reason why our industry and commerce have not made significant progress. Fortunately, in recent years, the government and the people have recognized that promoting national products is the only way to save the national economic crisis. The New Life Movement and the National Economic Construction Movement promoted by [Your] Excellency also listed the promotion of national products as one of their work guidelines. From then on, the government took the lead, and the people happily followed, and the future development of national products is limitless. The association is a joint organization of national product groups in Shanghai, and its establishment has been approved by the Ministry of Industry. Its internal work focuses on promoting and encouraging the use of national products. It is heard that the [Your] Yuan previously issued a notice to government agencies that they should give priority to purchasing national products for all needed items, which shows concern for the people's livelihood and is greatly admired. The association believes that this measure will promote the sales of national products and boost industrial development. However, the effectiveness of this order depends on the strictness of the supervision methods. After a collective discussion, it is proposed that the [Your] Yuan reaffirm the previous order for government agencies to purchase national products and strengthen supervision. In the future, if any agency purchases and uses foreign products instead of national product substitutes, the purchase should not be reimbursed, and the responsible personnel should be given appropriate punishment. This will allow national product manufacturers to develop slowly and steadily, and the entire national industry can be revitalized. [Your] Excellency has repeatedly shown approval for promoting national products. It is respectfully requested that you issue another clear order for its earnest implementation, which would be a great benefit." Respectfully submitted to the Executive Yuan of the National Government, Zhang Huikang, Hu Xiyuan, Lin Kanghou, Zhu Wenqi, and Wang Xingyao, Standing Committee Members of the Shanghai National Products Promotion Association.</p>
<h3>No Need to Affix Stamps to Withdrawal Slips</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Responds to Leather Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday replied to the Leather, Fur, Oil, and Bone Industry Trade Association, stating that there is no need to affix stamps to withdrawal slips used with passbooks. On the 3rd of this month, a letter was received asking whether stamps should be affixed to withdrawal slips used by bank depositors for transactions, even though they are using passbooks. Regarding this matter, the Ministry of Finance issued a directive on July 23 of last year, No. 6380, stating that the Shanghai Bankers Association has stated that a type of withdrawal slip used when withdrawing money from a passbook cannot be used to withdraw money solely based on the slip. It cannot be used externally and must still be used with the passbook to withdraw money from the original bank. Its nature is different from a check that can be used independently in the market. Since it cannot be used to withdraw money on its own, it does not fall within the scope of Article 16, Rate Table 4 of the new stamp tax and does not need to be stamped. The nature of the withdrawal slips used by banks with passbooks is no different from the withdrawal slips mentioned in the Ministry's directive. According to the aforementioned Ministry directive, there is no need to affix stamps. Moreover, the item of checks was also amended on February 10 of this year to be temporarily exempt from stamping. Therefore, the issues mentioned in the letter are no longer a problem according to the law.</p>

<h3>Saving China's Silk Foreign Trade Requires the Transformation of New Style Silk Reeling Machines</h3>
<p>The National Economic Council's Silk Improvement Association, the Silk Industry Department, and the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, in view of the huge volume of China's silk foreign trade, are taking measures to save China's silk exports. In addition to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau's quality inspection of Zhumen bamboo silk exports starting from August 1, grading inspections of raw silk exports will be carried out again on February 1 of next year. It is also planned to improve the silk reeling machines in various silk mills to prevent China's foreign market trade from being taken over by foreign silk. It is found that 80% to 90% of the silk reeling machines in silk mills in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are Italian-style silk reeling machines, with some Japanese re-reeling silk machines. However, there are very few of the newest Japanese upright reeling machines. For example, in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, Shanghai Baotai and Yihe factories use Japanese re-reeling silk machines, and Wuxi Yongtai and Hangzhou silk factories use Japanese upright reeling silk machines. All the rest are old-style Italian machines. It has now been decided to find ways to transform the old-style silk reeling machines into upright reeling machines and to add new upright reeling silk machines.</p>

<h3>Impersonating Officials to Extort Money with Medicine: Hu Hengxiang Summoned Yesterday</h3>
<p>Liu Wendao, our country's ambassador to Italy, whose Shanghai residence is located at No. 26, Lane 799, Haig Road in the French Concession, received a phone call at 4:00 PM on the 2nd of this month. The caller claimed to be sent by Wang Xiaolai, residing at No. 10, Huanlong Road, to deliver twenty bottles of refreshing medicine (痧藥水). After receiving the medicine, the caller requested a payment of twenty dollars to support charitable causes. Liu's family, noting that the master had no prior dealings with Wang, became suspicious upon receiving this unexpected call. They immediately contacted Wang's residence, where they were informed that Wang had no knowledge of this matter. It was then clear that the caller was an imposter attempting to defraud them. Shortly thereafter, a man arrived carrying twenty bottles of medicine and demanding twenty dollars. Liu's family detained the man and notified the Foch Police Station. Detectives arrived and took the medicine carrier and the medicine back to the station for interrogation. The man identified himself as Hu Hengxiang. He was detained pending further investigation. A brief account has already been published in this newspaper. Yesterday, the police transferred Hu to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. Attorney Chen Ming of the Police Department presented the case, charging Hu with attempted fraud. A representative from Liu's residence appeared in court to testify about the defendant's fraudulent scheme. Shi Menglan also appeared on behalf of Wang Xiaolai, testifying that some time ago, someone delivered thirty bottles of medicine to No. 3, Henry Lane, Henry Road, impersonating Wang Xiaolai and defrauding him of thirty dollars. He also presented a letter from Jiang Jianbai, the third section chief of the Education Bureau, to Wang as evidence, requesting a severe punishment. The defendant Hu Hengxiang testified that he was forty-six years old and from Yuyao. He claimed that he was drinking tea at the First Spring Teahouse on Maidun Road that day when someone handed him twenty bottles of medicine and asked him to deliver them to Liu's residence, saying that he would be paid twenty dollars. He believed this to be true and went, not knowing he was being deceived and victimized. He did not know the person and did not know their address. Judge Qiu Huan-ying examined the testimony and ordered a postponement for further questioning in seven days. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Robbery of a Prostitute's Gold Jewelry</h3>
<p>Mou Shouxiang Arrested</p>
<p>Wu Aibao, a prostitute known as Hua Yanchun Laoba who worked at a brothel at No. 1, South Lane, Fuyu Alley, resided at No. 41 Huacheng Road in the French Concession. On the 27th of last month, Wu, dressed elaborately, was riding in a rickshaw when she was suddenly robbed of a pair of gold bracelets at the entrance of No. 313 Balibridge Street. The incident was reported to the police, who were asked to apprehend the robbers and recover the stolen goods. A few days ago, the French police received an anonymous letter reporting that Mou Shouxiang had robbed the gold bracelets on Balibridge Street and sold them to the Juxing Silver Shop on Avenue Edward VII. The day before yesterday, Detective Liu Jinrong arrested Mou Shouxiang at No. 973 Minguo Road. Yesterday, he was brought before Judge Chen Shuoying in the First Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court for questioning. The police lawyer requested a postponement for further investigation. The complainant, Wu Aibao, recounted the details of the robbery. Mou denied the robbery. Detective Liu Jinrong then reported the circumstances of the defendant's arrest and investigation. The court ordered a postponement for further questioning. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Reclaiming Lost Wealth: Chinese People Build Factories to Manufacture Automobiles Domestically; Main Factory Set Up in Zhuzhou, Hunan, Branch Factory Set Up in Shanghai; Within Two Years, One Hundred Vehicles Can Be Manufactured Each Month</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, thanks to the vigorous efforts in road construction in our country in recent years, land transportation has become frequent. However, the automobiles used are mostly imported from various countries, resulting in a huge loss of wealth each year. Recognizing this, domestic industrialists have initiated the establishment of a China Automobile Manufacturing Factory and have begun preparations, aiming to manufacture all components within five years and supply the people with affordable products. This is a newly emerging industry in our country and should be welcomed by the people. The reporter has learned the following details of the establishment plan:</p>
<p>The Amount of Wealth Lost Each Year Is Astonishing</p>
<p>Although automobiles have only been imported into China for three to four decades, the increase in recent years has been significant. In large cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, and Guangzhou, the number of private automobiles has also increased year by year. Since the active construction of highways in various provinces, those open to traffic by the end of 1934 have reached more than 92,500 kilometers, and those in planning and construction have more than 68,000 kilometers. Due to the gradual development of highway transportation, the number of buses and transport vehicles running on highways has also increased rapidly. By the end of the same year, there were more than 50,000 automobiles in operation across the country, with Shanghai accounting for one-third of the total. Moreover, in recent years, the automobiles produced by various countries have been constantly updated, competing to be sold in our country, and the outflow of our money is alarming.</p>
<p>Factory Site Built; Completion This Year</p>
<p>Automobiles from various countries are powered by gasoline, and their prices are quite high. Ordinary passenger cars usually cost more than several thousand yuan, not to mention the daily consumption of gasoline. Because our country does not produce gasoline and must rely on imports from countries such as England, America, and Russia, domestic industrialists, recognizing this, initiated the establishment of the China Automobile Manufacturing Company, with capital set at six million yuan, which has already been fully subscribed. A preparatory office has been set up on Museum Road in Shanghai, and the main factory is set up in Zhuzhou, Hunan, with a branch factory in Shanghai. A factory site has been determined on Bansongyuan Road and construction is underway, which is expected to be completed this year. As for the components, they are ordered from Germany.</p>
<p>Complete Domestic Manufacturing After the Fifth Year</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the company, the factory specializes in manufacturing buses and transport vehicles, using diesel or vegetable oil as power, the cost of which is only one-third of that of gasoline. In terms of manufacturing, because there is a lack of such engineers in China, an agreement has been reached with the German Benz automobile company to send several engineers to assist and guide. In the two years after the start of production, the engines and steel materials will be supplied by Germany, and by the fifth year, the engines and other components can be manufactured domestically. It is estimated that the selling price will be several times cheaper than imported products, and the production volume will be one hundred vehicles per month in the first two years. Afterwards, depending on the business situation, branch factories will be added elsewhere, and production will be increased.</p>
<h3>Abductors Are Evil: After Two Girls Were Defiled, They Attempted to Sell Them to Dalian; The Two Girls, Seeing That the Situation Was Not Good, Cried Out Loud; The Police Detained Them and Transferred Them to the Court for Trial</h3>
<p>The abductors Xu Weichang, 28 years old, from Yancheng; Qiu Lianfu, 35 years old, from Yancheng; Qiu's wife, Qiu Wangshi, 25 years old; the female abductor Li Wang Laoer, 43 years old, from Yangzhou; the Liang Lao Si couple and their 19-year-old son Liang Sugen; and a gang including Xu Xiaolong and Chen Hongchang, totaling many people, specialize in trafficking in human beings. They entice and defile women before selling them. Xi Kouhong, an 18-year-old woman from Yancheng, who lived on Zhongshan Road, Caojiadu, and Zhou Xiaomei, a 16-year-old woman from Yancheng, both worked at a medicine factory in Xiaoshadu. They met Qiu Wangshi and became acquainted. Qiu saw them as valuable commodities and became very friendly with them, eventually becoming close friends. On June 17 of this year, while working the night shift, they met Qiu, who, seeing an opportunity, hid the two girls' work account books under the pretext of looking at them. The two girls, trusting Qiu, said that their husbands had taken them. Qiu then said that their husbands were at their mothers' home in Jimo. The two girls, needing the account books for work, asked Qiu to go with them to retrieve them. They were lured to a room in the Zhongxing Hotel at the Grand Self-Ringing Clock on Laobshen Road, where Xu Xiaolong and Chen Hongchang defiled them. The next morning, they were taken by car to a hotel on Sanma Road, where the Liang Lao Si couple entertained them with a sumptuous feast. Li Wang Laoer bought them new clothes and leather shoes. On the third day, Li Wang Laoer and Liang Sugen and others falsely told them they would be sent home. They drove to the Huangpu Wharf, intending to board a ship to Dalian to sell them. The girls, seeing that the situation was not good, cried out loudly and refused to board the ship. The police detained them and sent them to the police station, which then transferred them to the relevant police precinct. Unexpectedly, Xu Weichang, Qiu Lianfu, and Qiu Wangshi went to the two girls' homes, falsely claiming to have found them and extorting 5,000 yuan. They were then taken to the police station. The two parties met, and the truth of the case came to light. They were transferred to the District Court, where public charges were filed. Yesterday, Judge Zhang summoned them for questioning and ordered them to be returned to custody pending judgment.</p>

<h3>Robbery on Monk Jianshi Road</h3>
<p>At about 11:00 AM yesterday, seven burly men speaking with a Shandong accent robbed the Pu family residence at No. 4, Lane 708, Monk Jianshi Road. Three of the robbers had pistols. After entering the house, they separated and shouted at all the men and women in the house, confining them in the small rooms. They then forced the owner to hand over the keys and began searching, rummaging through boxes and chests and searching thoroughly. This lasted for about an hour. However, the Pu family had no valuables stored there, so they only managed to rob about 100 yuan in cash and clothing. Afterwards, the victim reported the incident to the relevant police station, requesting an investigation and arrest.</p>
<h3>Framing with Stolen Goods: Using Pills to Harm People; Yang Changsong's Malicious Intent; Sentenced to One Year and Six Months</h3>
<p>Wu Rongsheng, a native of Yancheng residing at No. 150 Taoyuan Lane, Tiantong Road, was responsible for watching and protecting cargo being unloaded from large ships arriving in the Huangpu River and transported to the shore by barges. He was quite successful. His fellow townsmen Tao Jingzhi and Yang Changsong coveted his position. In May of this year, they plotted to have their accomplices Xing Wenzhu and Cao Wanshun secretly plant several packets of poisonous pills, totaling eighty pills, at Wu's home, hoping to report him to the police, arrest him, and seize his business. However, Xing and Cao were not careful enough, and Wu discovered the plot. He found the pills and threw them in the trash. He reported it to the Hongkou police, who arrested Tao, Xing, and Cao and handed them over to the First Special District Court. After questioning, each was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment. Yang, the mastermind, fled and a warrant was issued for his arrest. The Chinese and foreign detectives handling the case arrested Yang at No. 15 Fenzhou Road the day before yesterday. Yesterday, he was sent to the Third Criminal Division, where Judge Zhong Qing questioned him and sentenced Yang Changsong to one year and six months of imprisonment as a warning.</p>
<h3>After Reorganization, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Has Made Great Progress in Its Business; There Is a Shortage of Ships on All Routes Due to a Surplus of Cargo; A Decision Has Been Made to Build New Ocean Liners</h3>
<p>Since Zeng Guangqing took over as the director of the business department of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, he has been planning to revive the business, advancing on the Yangtze River, South Seas and North Seas routes simultaneously. He has also added a Changsha route, reclaiming a large amount of transportation profits that had been flowing out. In March of this year, the company's Yangtze River shipping business declined for a time, but in the most recent two months, freight rates on the Yangtze River have been congested, and revenue has increased greatly. Among the six companies, it has jumped from sixth place to first place. As for the South China route, after the establishment in Guangdong, the exchange rate has stabilized, and customers have been rushing to stockpile goods. Cotton yarn, piece goods, and sundries are fully loaded on the Sihai and other ships each time they set sail, and customers still regret not being able to ship as much as they want. Director Zeng has decided to seize this opportunity to lease more ocean liners and assign them to the South China line to meet demand. At the same time, he is consulting with the shipbuilding department to quickly purchase new ships to strengthen coastal shipping. As for the North Seas route, which was hit by smuggling a few months ago, thanks to Director Zeng's efforts and personal involvement in cargo transportation, each time the Tianjin liner sets sail, it is fully loaded with grains and flour. In the past two months, the prosperous business of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on the Yangtze River and the South Seas routes has broken all previous records, and there is a shortage of tonnage on all routes.</p>

<h3>Brief News from the Summer Vacation National Products Promotion Group</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the National Products Promotion Group for the summer vacation of various middle schools has been working hard in various districts of the city, promoting and guiding the use of national products. It is said that the group is purely composed of students staying at school during the summer vacation, who, aware of the national crisis, believe that there is no way to save the country and survive without actively promoting national products and developing national industries. They have voluntarily organized a national products promotion group based on the standpoint of loving the country. The rumor that it is being organized by the Shanghai National Products Movement Federation is a mistake.</p>
<h3>Progress in the Local Court Gun Loss Case: Two More Thieves Apprehended; Stolen Guns Recovered</h3>
<p>On the night of May 9 of this year, 20 new-style pistols were stolen from the Shanghai Local Court's exhibit vault. After the court issued an arrest warrant, detectives from the Yulin Road Police Station arrested Wang Xiao A San and Wang Shi, a runaway woman, for selling firearms and recovered 12 stolen guns. After interrogation, they confessed that they had colluded with Chen A Yu (who had once served as a public servant) to steal the guns from the court. They were immediately handed over to the Shanghai Local Court. During the investigation, the suspects' statements were unusually sophisticated and cunning, and it was impossible to investigate their organization. Therefore, the prosecutor filed a public prosecution for the crime of theft at night in a gang. The court appointed Judge Zhang Peiming to hear the case. Recently, the Public Concession police arrested two bandits, Ding A Si and Zhang Chufa, and recovered a pistol, which was also a missing gun from the Shanghai Local Court. It was learned that the gun belonged to Pan Xiao Mao, who had been released from prison in April of this year. Therefore, they were handed over to the First Special District Court, which first transferred the pistol part to the Nanshi Court for trial. After Prosecutor Xie held a preliminary hearing, it was sent back to the First Special District Court yesterday for trial of the theft case. If further questioning is needed, they will be brought over again. As for Wang Xiao A Yu and Wang Shi, they were also heard by Judge Zhang yesterday. Because accomplices of Ding A Si and others have been discovered, there is a need for further research and investigation. The adjournment was announced for a later date.</p>
<h3>Lack of Freedom of Marriage: A Man and a Woman Throw Themselves into the River; Fortunately, They Were Spotted and Rescued by Chinese Police; Their Lives Are in Danger Due to Excessive Water Ingestion</h3>
<p>Liu Zhengqing, 23 years old, from Changzhou, was an apprentice at the Mei Zuishi Foreign Company at No. 1110 Jiujiang Road. Recently, he fell in love with Ding Huiying, a beautiful young woman of twenty who lived at No. 71, Xin Kang Lane, Da Tong Road, and was the daughter of Ding, a dinner maker. They were deeply in love. Because their parents opposed their marriage and they had no freedom, Liu went to Ding's residence at 10:50 PM yesterday and asked her to go to the Bund Park to commit suicide by drowning together. Fortunately, a Chinese policeman numbered 172 spotted them and managed to rescue them. They were immediately taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, they ingested too much water and their lives may be in danger.</p>
<h3>Two Ships Damaged Their Engines</h3>
<p>Ningjing: The Ningjing ship of the Ningshao Company, which was sailing to Qingdao to transport coal to Shanghai, damaged its propeller while being towed to turn around and leave the dock when preparing to set sail from Qingdao on the 2nd. The tow rope got caught in the Ningjing's engine propeller, causing the propeller to jam. The Ningjing immediately stopped and dropped anchor. Divers were hired to enter the port, first remove the tow rope, and then find a way to sail. The damage to the propeller will be inspected and repaired after arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Baofeng: The Baofeng ship of the Baofeng Company, which sails on the Chongsha route, was hit by a hurricane that swept through the port and stirred up large waves while approaching Chongming. The waves damaged the ship's engine propeller. Efforts are now being made to sail it back to Shanghai for repairs.</p>
<h3>Farewell Dinner for Chief Prosecutor Zhong at the Local Court</h3>
<p>Zhong Shangbin, the chief prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Court, has been transferred to the position of chief prosecutor of the Jiangxi High Court by order of the Ministry. His vacancy will be filled by Zhu Huanbiao, the presiding judge of the criminal division of the Shanghai High Court Branch. The new Chief Prosecutor Zhu is scheduled to take office on the 7th of this month. Chief Prosecutor Zhong will go to Jiangxi to take office after Chief Prosecutor Zhu arrives and takes over.

<h3>Recent News on the Xu Wancheng Case: Appeal Filed Because Bail Was Denied; Jiangsu High Court Has Ruled to Reverse the Decision</h3>
<p>Xu Wancheng, the owner of the Longwen Bookstore in Dama Gate, was sued for defamation and obstruction of official duties for publishing a special work journal that was deemed to have offended the Shanghai Local Court. He has been detained for two months. Cai Yuanpei, the president of the Academia Sinica, and others sent a letter requesting bail, but it was denied. Later, Xu's wife, Zhu Airu, appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. A few days ago, the High Court ruled that "The Shanghai Local Court's denial of bail in the Xu case is not fully in accordance with the provisions of Articles 117 and 114 of the Criminal Procedure Law, and it is a misunderstanding to use the danger of continued crime as a reason for not allowing bail and stopping detention, which is legally unfounded. The original ruling should be revoked and sent back to the original court for a new legal ruling." It is learned that after receiving this ruling from the Jiangsu High Court yesterday, Xu's wife has again requested the Shanghai Local Court to release her husband on bail.</p>
<h3>Robbery at Yongxiang Lane, Zhabei: On-the-Spot Capture of a Lookout, Confiscation of a Four-Inch Handgun Without Bullets, Wang Pinggen Confesses Zhang Zhongxin Conceived the Plan</h3>
<p>At No. 31 Yongxiang Lane, Datong Road, Zhabei, the residence of Yu Deshun, former proprietor of Zhuangyuanlou Restaurant on Jiujiang Road, five elegantly dressed bandits suddenly appeared yesterday around 2:00 PM. One bandit wore a white short shirt and Xiangyun gauze trousers, two wore white silk short shirts and trousers, one wore a white cloth short shirt and trousers, and one wore a white short shirt and black trousers. All spoke with local accents. They brandished two handguns. Two bandits stood guard at the front and back doors, while three bandits burst in through the back door, claiming to be looking for Yu Deshun. At that time, Yu's eldest son, Xiangrui, 33 years old, had just returned home, carrying over 40 yuan in legal tender. After the bandits broke in, they immediately drove Yu's family into a back room and assigned one bandit to monitor their movements. The remaining two bandits went upstairs, ransacking chests and cabinets. They stole over 40 yuan in legal tender, a diamond ring, a gold bracelet, and a gold bangle, causing significant losses. During the robbery, Mao Gongzhao, the deputy leader of the detective squad of the Xinzha Sub-bureau, also lived in the lane. After being secretly informed, Mao rushed to report to the squad. The squad leaders Bao Ziying and Qian Tianxiong, along with chief leader Li Shouchang, led detectives Liu Bingrong, Xiao Huaiyu, and Lü Qingkang to the scene. The bandits had already finished robbing and were escaping in different directions. One bandit acting as a lookout fled behind, but was apprehended by Mao Gongzhao and others at the intersection of Huasheng Road and Chang'an Road. A four-inch handgun without bullets was confiscated on the spot. After being taken to the team, the bandit identified himself as Wang Pinggen, 24 years old, formerly a Red Gang tailor, currently unemployed, and residing at his relative's home on Avenue Blanché in the French Concession. He confessed that there were five accomplices in total, with two handguns. "My handgun was supplied by Zhang Zhixin. Zhang was an apprentice at Zhuangyuanlou four years ago, so he knows the Yu Deshun family. This robbery was also conceived by Zhang. We first gathered at the entrance of the Guanghua Cinema on Avenue Edouard, having previously met at a hotel to discuss robbing the Yu family of their property. Zhang lives in the front building of the three-story house at No. 54 Avenue Foch in the French Concession. There are also A-gen and A-xing, and someone I don't know. A-gen lives with Zhang. We planned to divide the loot in front of the Guanghua Cinema," he said. After obtaining this information, the squad immediately dispatched the original detective team to the British and French Concessions, in conjunction with the Chengdu Road Police Station and the Lujiawan Police Station, to search for and arrest the gang members at the Guanghua Cinema and No. 54 Avenue Foch, but without success. The squad is currently trying to arrest the remaining gang members and recover the stolen goods. It was also learned that the squad had summoned the victim to inquire about the bandit Zhang Zhijia, who was indeed a former apprentice at Zhuangyuanlou.</p>

<h3>The Fate of the Changde Steamer Remains Unknown, Concerns Grow; The Gongping Steamer Saw It Off the Coast of Waitengshan, Subsequently Lost Contact</h3>
<p>The Changde steamer, belonging to the Liping Steamer Company of this port, has been missing since August 1st after departing from Nanjing for Guangdong Province. Details were reported in yesterday's paper. According to a telegram from the captain of the Gongping steamer, which sailed to Guangdong in the same convoy, the Changde steamer sailed to the waters off Waitengshan (also known as Nanwudao) outside Shantou port. The Gongping steamer still saw the Changde steamer following behind. After that point, the Gongping and other steamers sailed to Guangzhou, and the Changde steamer disappeared without a trace. According to crew members of various sea-going vessels arriving in Shanghai from Guangdong yesterday, the ships had received telegrams requesting them to search and were actively searching the waters off Shantou and Fuzhou, but without any sign of the vessel. Even if it was sheltering from the wind, four days had passed by yesterday, and there should have been some news arriving in Shanghai. This reporter inquired with the company. As of 6:00 PM yesterday, there had been no telegram from the Changde steamer to Shanghai. Although the company is still constantly searching, the outcome is showing no possibility of a clue. The steamer's future is becoming increasingly concerning. If there is no news within the next day or two, it is feared that the situation is mostly inauspicious. In addition to the crew of over seventy sailors, there are also several hundred passengers on board, so all parties in Shanghai are taking this matter very seriously, constantly inquiring with the company about its whereabouts. It is heard that all crew members have a total of over 30,000 yuan in accident and life insurance.</p>
<h3>The Women's Hudong Service Corps Promotes Rural Hygiene, 3,000 Hygiene Kits Distributed, Bicycles Given to Rural Areas</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Hudong Service Corps promoted hygiene work in the countryside yesterday. This reporter visited the Corps' office at 2680 Xiangyin Road at 6:00 AM to observe the event. The Corps staff and Boy Scouts were preparing to depart, so I took photographs and inquired about the preparations. It was stated that the Corps' work in promoting the New Life Movement has been progressing smoothly. The amount of donations and donated items is still considerable. They have now produced over three thousand hygiene kits, containing cleaning supplies and hygiene products. With the consent of the Shanghai Boy Scouts Council, they dispatched over sixty Boy Scouts, led by Mr. Xie Yanbo, with guides from local security forces in each district. They rode bicycles, each carrying dozens of kits, and distributed them door-to-door in the rural areas of Jiangwan, Yinxiang, and the three districts of the city center, as encouragement. At the same time, they posted New Life Movement slogans and disseminated knowledge of hygiene. It is said that they will send Corps members again in the future to conduct surveys and guide the villagers in implementing the New Life Movement at any time. Other facilities and work are still in progress.</p>
<h3>The Jinyi Road Renji Orphanage is Under Construction, First Building Two Residences, Can Accommodate 500 Children</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: On the 3rd of this month, it was reported that a large orphanage would be built on Jinyi Road, capable of accommodating 3,000 babies. The reporter specially visited Mr. Lu Bohong, the founder of the orphanage, regarding this matter. According to him, the orphanage is organized by the Heping Ciyouyuan (Peace Charity Orphanage) of the Catholic Society, in view of the poor economic situation in various places, with infants being sent to Shanghai for care. All orphanages are full, and those who come later have nowhere to go. Therefore, the Society is donating funds to build a Renji Orphanage on Jinyi Road. Two residences will be built first, each capable of accommodating 250 infants, for a total of 500. It is planned to expand to 1,000 in the future, but there is no plan to accommodate 3,000 infants. The architectural drawings have been completed and are being submitted to the Municipal Works Bureau for a construction permit. Once received, construction can begin, and it is expected to be completed and opened within the year. Mr. Lu specifically requested that the record of a previous misreporting be corrected and said that the charitable cause of childcare in China is extremely necessary, but our capacity is limited and difficult to extend widely. We hope that all philanthropists will rise up and take action to benefit young infants.</p>
<h3>Xiao Caifa Directly Admits Robbery and Arson, Formed a Gang to Commit Evil in Western Shanghai, Confesses to a Large Number of Accomplices</h3>
<p>Xiao Caifa (a.k.a. "Little Old Man"), a native of Yancheng, 27 years old, residing at No. 211, across from the Dingxin Textile Factory in Western Shanghai, did not engage in honest work. He gathered accomplices and engaged in various illegal activities, with everyone publicly electing Xiao as their leader, specializing in robbing property, injuring victims, and arson in Western Shanghai, totaling over a dozen cases. (Three houses near the Dingxin Textile Factory were burned down in March of this year by the criminal.) Yesterday, Zhao Fan, the leader of the detective squad of the Caojiadu Public Security Sub-bureau, discovered that Xiao and several accomplices were secretly meeting inside a house at the Dingxin Textile Factory. He immediately, without making a sound, led Deputy Leader Sun Rongsheng and other officers to surround the house. Leader Zhao led the men to break down the door and rush in, arresting Xiao Caifa, Zhang Fucai, and Xiao Su on the spot, and took them back to the squad headquarters for questioning. Xiao directly admitted to repeatedly committing robbery and arson, and confessed that three handguns and one hundred bullets were hidden somewhere on Route Robert, a location that Zhao had already discovered. After obtaining this information, Leader Zhao escorted Xiao, along with chief Xu Jintang, detectives Liang Jianwu, Zhang Diling, and others, to search the location with the Putuo Road Police Station, but without success. He also confessed to a large number of accomplices, who had all fled upon hearing the news. The squad immediately handed Xiao and the other three criminals over to the sub-bureau for questioning. The sub-bureau, due to Xiao's repeated arson and robbery, immediately prepared a document for submission to the General Bureau for strict punishment.</p>
<h3>Delivering Leather Shoes Leads to Kidnapping, Huang Futian Tragically Strangled to Death, Two Kidnappers Interrogated Yesterday, The Deceased's Brother Recounts the Tragic Death of His Brother, The Two Kidnappers Confess to Renting the House and the Circumstances of the Murder, The Case is Concluded and Will Be Pronounced on the 11th</h3>
<p>Huang Futian, 27 years old, a native of Haimen, whose brother, Fuzhao, is the junior owner of the Gaohe Leather Shoe Store at No. 191 Tongfu Road, was given three pairs of men's leather shoes and one pair of women's leather shoes by his brother on the evening of May 16th at 10:05 PM. He was instructed to deliver them to a customer named Yuan in Room 529 of the Yangtze Hotel, and then proceed to a customer named Wang in Room 324 of the Dongfang Hotel by rickshaw. It was unexpectedly planned by the thugs. He was lured to a kitchen in No. 15, Lane 176, Ma'an Lane, Chongqing Road, where he was tied up, planning to send a letter to his brother demanding a ransom of 30,000 yuan. Because they shouted for help,</p>
<p>The case of murder and death occurred and has been handled by the Hongkou Police Station. Chinese detectives Zhang Desheng, Zhang Yaoji, and Hua Youshan successively arrested two criminal suspects from Yong, Liu Zongyou and Hu Shila, in Xuanhai County and Kunming Road, respectively, and sent them to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefen continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the Municipal Council filed a public prosecution according to Article 347, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law for the crime of kidnapping and demanding ransom, and presented a murder weapon and nine ransom letters, requesting strict punishment according to the law. According to Huang Fuzhao, the brother of the deceased, the fugitive ringleader, Ge Chengsi, is a friend and colleague of mine,</p>
<p>Used to make leather, he came over to play a few times beforehand. He didn't come on the 16th of May, but Hu Shila (i.e., the second defendant) came, falsely claiming that Mr. Wang, a resident of the Dongfang Hotel, wanted to order leather shoes, Room 324. Hu himself wanted to buy a pair. They came twice in the morning, and my brother Futian happened to be going to a customer named Yuan at the Yangtze Hotel, so he conveniently went to the Dongfang Hotel. Who knew he would suffer such a disaster afterwards. That night, the thugs threw a ransom letter, which was thrown in through the gap in the iron fence, to meet in a certain mountain in Ningbo Fenghua. We immediately reported to the police and later sent someone to Yong to</p>
<p>Wait at the agreed location, but no one came to talk. Later, my brother's body was found in the kitchen on Chongqing Road. When I went to identify it, his face was blurred, and his clothes, wallet, and rickshaw were all beside him. The thugs took 20 yuan in cash, which was given by the customer Yuan at the Yangtze Hotel, etc. According to Du Li, a woman from Yong, she is the second landlord of the kitchen on Chongqing Road. On May 11th, two people with a Ningbo accent came to rent it, claiming to be coppersmiths at a car dealership on Weihaiwei Road, saying that they were uncle and nephew. The rent of seven yuan was too expensive, so they didn't rent it. They came again the next day and agreed to pay two yuan as a deposit first, renting from the 13th. On the afternoon of the 16th, they moved in with</p>
<p>Bedding, short stools, tables, and other things, but no family members. Later, they claimed that they had a wife and a son who came to Shanghai from Yong. At 4:00 PM on the 18th, they claimed to have received a letter and had important business to return to Yong, but the defendant had not seen them. Later, the police came and said that there was a foul smell coming from the kitchen. I mistook it for the smell of salted fish, because the door was locked, so I asked the apprentice to break in with the police and saw the body found under the bed. I reported it to the police, etc. Questioning Liu Zongyou, he confessed that the house was rented by Ge Chengsi. Beforehand, Ge invited me to discuss it in an open space near Sanguantang on Huaji Road, asking me to help kidnap the owner of the leather shoe store. I initially refused, but Ge said it was okay to</p>
<p>Be bold and do it. At that time, Xiao Song and I were waiting in the kitchen. When the victim arrived, Yin Gen asked him to sample the leather shoes, and Xiao Song pushed him down. Yin Gen and I tied him up with rope. When the victim shouted, Ge Chengsi covered his mouth with a towel and cotton. Because the victim recognized him, Ge strangled him with a leather belt. When the victim arrived, Ge hid under the bed. The murder weapon was also bought by Ge. The rest of his confession was evasive. Questioning Hu Shila, he confessed that he was fooled by Ge Chengsi, Xiao Song, and Yin Gen, and committed this kidnapping. Ge Chengsi had borrowed 20 yuan from me in advance for renting a house and other expenses, saying that he hoped to get 10,000 yuan after the matter was done. Before the victim died, Ge had me write a ransom letter. After he died, Ge said that things were as they were, and forced me to write more letters. The rest of his confession was the same as above. Please judge. Judge Xiao ordered them to be detained and scheduled the pronouncement for the morning of the 11th.</p>
<h3>The French Police Strictly Prohibit Prostitution, The Political Affairs Director Receives Reporters, Recounts the Wang Aidi Case</h3>
<p>Vice Superintendent and Director of Political Affairs of the French Concession Police Department, Sarli, invited reporters from various newspapers to the General Police Station for a discussion at 4:45 PM yesterday. Sarli recounted the Wang Aidi case, which was translated by Cao Bingsheng, inspector of the Political Affairs Department. Sarli said that at 11:45 PM on July 5th, a Chinese officer from No. 140 patrolled the intersection of Avenue d'Eylau and Rue de Glocque, and saw a man talking to a Chinese officer from No. 399. The man's name was Wu Shengyin, 18 years old, residing at No. 641 Xizang Road. He said that at around 11:00 PM, he was urinating in the lane and was forcibly pulled into the house at No. 21 by a prostitute and her madam. Because he only had a dozen copper coins and two meal bills, he was driven out, and the bills were lost, etc. The officers then arrested the prostitute and her madam and took them to the police station. The prostitute's name was Wang Aidi, 18 years old, from Yangzhou. She was an unlicensed prostitute. She had been arrested and fined for soliciting customers on January 19th, February 2nd, and March 2nd of this year, as evidenced by her fingerprint card. Later, Wang Aidi, fearing being sent to a relief home, confessed that there were several other prostitutes in the house at No. 21 in the lane. Because it was late at night, the police sent detectives along with Wang Aidi on the 7th to arrest five prostitutes, who were each fined five yuan and released. The police did not beat Wang Aidi,</p>
<h3>Selling Fake Passports, More Victims Have Not Arrived, The Court Must Continue to Summon and Question</h3>
<p>Chen Heming, the owner of the Gong Sheng Inn at Jiuhua Lane, Nanshi, along with Zhu Jieqing, Wu Guoliang, Wang Weide, and the fugitives Chen Dahua and Chen Junming, jointly forged twenty-one Republic of China passports, and forged the seals of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the consulates in Bombay and Trieste, affixing them on the passport, falsely claiming they were genuine. They sold them to twenty-one merchants traveling abroad, including Wu Fanggui and Li Aliang, for over 200 yuan each. Wu and others boarded the Japanese ship Hakone and a French postal ship to Marseille, where they were discovered by the police, who notified the consulate, which reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which then informed the Municipal Government to arrest Chen, Zhu, Wu, and Wang, and prosecute them. Two trials have been held. Yesterday, Father Chen, a judge, conducted the trial. Witness Wang Lansheng testified that he did not recognize the defendants brought to court, but that Chen Dahua and Chen Junming went to Ruian, Zhejiang, to tout passports and were paid a total of 540 yuan, etc. The judge stated that there were still victims who had not arrived, and they would be summoned for questioning.</p>
<h3>Wang Xuanyan Died of Illness, Although Suspected of Improper Medication, Unwilling to Conduct an Autopsy</h3>
<p>Wang Xuan, a native of Sichuan, 34 years old, residing at No. 481 Haining Road, had recently been suffering from dizziness, abdominal pain, and other symptoms. He hired Wu Guoqing, a doctor at No. 470, Section West, Peng Road, North Sichuan Road, to treat him, but it was ineffective. Until around 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, he died. His wife, Xu, and younger brother, Xianliang, suspected that Wu's medication was improper, and reported it to the Hongkou Police Station, which ordered detective Wang Chonghao to investigate. They then sent Wang's body to Tongren Hospital. After a brief examination, they ordered it to be sent to the Fei Lun Road mortuary. Yesterday morning, prosecutor Tang from the First Special District Court, accompanied by forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the mortuary to examine the body. They immediately took their seats in court. First, Chinese police chief Xu Shunqing reported the previous events and presented the medicine Wang had taken. Wang Xianliang also stated that the deceased was his elder brother, who had previously consulted Dr. Wu for dizziness and other symptoms. He was later brought to his home for treatment. However, around 4:00 PM yesterday, seeing that his illness was serious, he again asked Dr. Wu to come to his home and gave four injections. His condition not only did not improve, but he suddenly died at 6:00 PM. Therefore, he requested justice, etc. Mr. Tang stated that there was no doubt that the deceased died of illness, but whether the medicine given by Dr. Wu was incorrect or not would only be clear after the body was dissected. He then asked the deceased's wife and brother if they were willing to have the body dissected and examined, but they both refused. He then ruled that the deceased, Wang Xuan, had indeed died of illness before death, and ordered his brother, Wang Xianliang, to sign a guarantee and collect the body for burial.</p>
<h3>Liping Crushed Coal Boat Suffers Losses of Over 2,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>At 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, a Liping Steamer was leaving Shanghai and heading to the Haiyangshe wharf in Pudong. Because the wind was strong at the time, the ship was difficult to support. The bow moved towards the shore and completely crushed two wharf boats, No. 8252 and No. 57885, which were berthed at the outer side of the Chunhe Steamer loading coal. The steamer quickly reversed and withdrew. That night, Zhang Shunfa and Zhu Zhengji, the owners of the damaged boats, reported the incident to the Customs Water Patrol Police Station for filing, claiming that the losses to the two boats amounted to over 2,000 yuan, awaiting compensation for the losses.</p>

<p>Suicide by Hanging Due to Illness: Fu Liande, a native of Shandong, 32 years old, was a road bridge watchman for the British Municipal Council at the intersection of Hopeland Road and Route Youni in Western Shanghai. Recently, he contracted syphilis and had no money for treatment, resulting in ulcers on his lower body and unbearable pain. He became disillusioned with the world and hanged himself on a bamboo fence there the night before last. Yesterday, a passerby discovered it and reported it to the Wangjialou Police Station, which ordered the local security chief Zong Yuanhao to report to the hospital for an autopsy.

<h3>The Anhui Public Organization in Shanghai Cables Request for Bail for Wang Daiqing</h3>
<p>The various public organizations of Anhui in Shanghai jointly cabled the Wei General Commander and Commissioner Jiang of Liu'an yesterday, stating: "We have recently received a report from our fellow villagers that Wang Daiqing, the director of the Liu'an County Relief Home, has been falsely accused to the Qingjiao Headquarters and has been sent to the Commissioner's Office for investigation. The news has spread far and wide, causing panic among the people. We have learned that Mr. Wang has served his hometown for more than ten years. Because he is brave and responsible, he may have offended some people. Since his arrest, local shops, elders, and gentlemen have jointly guaranteed him, which shows that he is definitely not a so-called local tyrant, but has merely been slandered by jealous people. Although General Commander Wei is wise and will eventually reveal the truth, Mr. Wang's freedom has been unjustly restricted. We cannot bear to see local people arbitrarily entrap others in the law due to differences of opinion. Therefore, we dare to presume and humbly request that you immediately grant Mr. Wang bail, and impartially investigate and judge according to the law, to warn against malicious practices and maintain the rule of law. We are deeply grateful. The joint meeting of the Anhui Fellow Villagers Organizations in Shanghai bows."</p>
<h3>A Thief Electrocuted to Death at Luen Cheong Weaving and Dyeing Factory, Discovered Due to a Power Outage, Body Was Charred Black, a Gruesome Sight</h3>
<p>At 10:30 PM the day before yesterday, the lights in the Luen Cheong Weaving and Dyeing Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, suddenly went out. The factory manager suspected that the main switch was damaged and urgently notified the Pudong Electricity Company to send a technician for repairs. When the technician arrived at the factory at 11:00 PM and was inspecting the problem, he suddenly found a black figure on top of the high wall by the river. He shined a flashlight on it and found a dead man clinging to the iron bar with both hands, his feet resting on the joint of a water pipe on the wall. His body was electrocuted by the main power line. The current was blocked, causing the outage. He immediately reported to the Pudong Branch Bureau, who summoned the local security chief, Lu Shunlong. Yesterday morning, he reported to the local court. At 2:00 PM, prosecutor Li Fen was assigned to cross the river to Pudong and ordered the body to be taken down. An examination of the body revealed a wound on the right back, about a foot long and seven inches wide, and eight inches deep. Another smaller wound on the right thigh, about a foot long and four inches wide, and two inches deep, was charred like charcoal. His whole body was black, and his lower body was completely shrunken. The skin was covered with small blisters. The death was extremely gruesome. No relatives were found to claim the body. He ordered the local security chief to prepare a coffin and bury it. As for who the deceased was, viewers speculated that he was a thief who had sneaked into the factory. Because it was late at night, he could not escape, so he climbed the water pipe to reach the top of the wall, intending to use the telegraph pole outside the wall to climb down. In a hurry, his back touched the power line, resulting in his death.</p>

<h3>Wu Lianzhou Discusses Damp-Heat Syndrome</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been many cases of damp-heat syndrome, but few people understand its causes and symptoms. According to Wu Lianzhou, a national medicine doctor who provides voluntary service at this newspaper, the excessive rainfall during the moldy season increases the humidity in the air, and the hot summer raises the temperature. All indoor utensils, clothing, food, etc., have attached temperature and humidity. The warmth and moisture permeate the air, and we inevitably absorb it through our mouths and noses and then penetrate through our skin, causing the condition. In the initial stage of damp-heat syndrome, the body temperature reaches 103 or 104 degrees. Over five or six days, it becomes lighter in the morning and more severe in the evening. After more than two weeks, it gradually diminishes. After more than a month, the symptoms subside in the morning and return in the evening, and it takes more than a month to recover. The symptoms may include aversion to cold, headache, chest tightness, nausea, irritability, loose stools, dark urine, and the appearance of red rashes and white scales. In children, the onset is often accompanied by convulsions and coughing, and in adults, by throat swelling, coughing up blood, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. These are signs of the onset of the disease and should be carefully examined and not misdiagnosed. Two colleagues at this newspaper, Wang Runfu and Ye Shaoqing, both suffered from damp-heat syndrome and were cured by Dr. Wu Lianzhou. Dr. Wu has extensive experience in treating damp-heat syndrome and his prescriptions are effective. His clinic is located next door to the west of this newspaper.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton - New Cotton Dumped Cheaply - Forward Yarn and Cotton Heavily Sold Short</h3>
<p>The yarn and cotton market started to rise and then fell, and the trend was extremely weak, and the downward trend was very strong. This is because the recent dumping of new cotton has been cheap, and some factories have purchased a lot of it. They have been heavily selling short in forward labeled yarn, and calculating the cost is profitable. As a result, the surface has loosened. As for the bulls, there have also been sell-offs, and the market price has become more and more unsustainable.</p>

Then the weather turned sunny, and the new cotton was sold off at a particularly low price the previous day. The opening price was lower than the October futures cotton price. Most cotton merchants were unilaterally bearish, and the downward trend started again. At the same time, the US cotton situation was also sluggish, bleak, and lifeless.</p>
<p>The Forward New Cotton Turned Back After One Rise</p>

Many said that the new cotton was dumped cheaply and the labeled cotton market was too high. The shorts were active. It was also said that the current bad weather was not of great importance. By the time of closing, the downward trend in distant months had become more and more serious. The back three-month contracts all broke through the one-yuan mark.

<h3>US Cotton Private Estimates Increased Significantly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of the US cotton market was calm due to the large discrepancy in private estimates, and the buyers were hesitant. Each month ranged from unchanged to a drop of three pound sounds. Then, the closing of the long positions on Wall Street and the cotton farmers' short sales caused the market price to fall. The industry was still the best buyer. The spot market was bleak and firm. The New York Cotton Exchange estimated that the worldwide rolling stock of US cotton, as of August 1st, was 7,106,000 bales, compared to 9,041,000 bales last year and 10,701,000 bales the year before last.

<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 4th was that White Rossi for July-August was 228.5 rupees, down 0.25 rupees. White Rossi for April-May was 216.5 rupees, the same as the previous day. Aomra for December-January was 198 rupees, the same as the previous day.</p>
<p>US Cotton Private Estimate 3rd New York Telegram, the Fanqueer Publishing House announced this year's estimate, the production percentage is 70.4, and the output is 11,951,000 bales, an increase of 540,000 bales compared to the last decision (July 1st).</p>
<p>Three-Product Yarn and Cotton Returned Slightly 4th Osaka Telegram, three-product futures yarn fell four jiao to one yuan, the near month was 210 yuan, and the distant month was 203 yuan. Futures cotton fell one jiao to six jiao, the near month was 68.4 yuan, and the distant month was 64.3 yuan.</p>
<h3>Food - Foreign Wheat Continued to Rise - Futures and Spot Wheat Called High by Five or Six Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after the opening in the morning, each month showed a consistent good sign. The quotation for foreign wheat, Chicago's performance was good at 12 jiao, Canada's rose by 1.1 yuan to 1.3 yuan. When the opening price was announced, the market was surprised by the continued rise of foreign wheat, so each month's opening price secretly rose by three or four fen, and then the opening price rose by another one or two fen because the buying was still smooth. Fortunately, customers from distant places and peers from this street had real goods to sell short, so the market was able to be suppressed. Otherwise, it would not be surprising to see it gradually soar. The spot wheat market saw less cargo arriving these days. Customers who had arrived were very firm and unwilling to sell easily. Therefore, each stall called for prices, and the price was raised by another five fen. The Shanghai factory opened a special high price of 4.67 yuan, ranging from 5.5 jiao to 4.5 jiao. As for the Japanese stomach, it was said that they were still greedy, but because the shipping schedule had been pushed back to after the 22nd, the traders were unwilling to sell in advance, and the eating price was still five fen higher than the Shanghai factory. Given this situation, if exports are not prohibited, changes may occur.</p>
<h3>Flour Transactions Were Hindered by Price Limits - Except for This Month, the Rest Were Almost at a Standstill</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, at the opening in the morning, except for the current month, which was still not very active, the rest of the months were almost at a standstill. Because the current month has more chips, the recent flour sales have not been tight, so it hovered between two fen and 1.75 jiao. The months after September were all hindered by price limits, and buying and selling were difficult to activate, so there were very few transactions. It was faintly heard that distant month shorts were eagerly seeking to close positions, and there were dark disks, and the rumors for November were two fen, and the rumors for December were 2.5 fen, but both sides were contacting each other on their own and were not formal.</p>
<h3>Hakka Xian New Goods Arrived Continuously</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Hakka Xian arrived continuously, and new loans continued to arrive, and the Japanese stomach was slightly relieved, and the market temporarily turned stable. Because the market price had risen for three or four days in a row, the owners were unwilling to keep holding on, and the Hakka helpers' stomach was not as greedy as the other day, so it was temporarily settled. However, each helper had entertainment, and the market was still optimistic. Yesterday's digestion was more active on this street. Sichuan inland Ningbo Yue helpers all had entertainment. The total number of Jiangxi rice opened throughout the day was 2,448 bags, Xiang rice 1,500 bags, Han coarse rice 176 bags, and Jiangbei coarse rice 300 bags. The price was similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Saw Both Rise and Fall</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of 14 or 15 sources arrived from each helper, with a total of nearly 3,000 piculs. However, the sales market on this street turned sluggish, and the package stomach was still not moving, resulting in a stable but soft market situation. The thick early japonica rice was tired, and the thin indica rice market has recovered several fen to nearly jiao. Du Yangjian was also tired, and Yin Bianyuan was firm. Dongxin only arrived 12 piculs in the North Market, and the price still remained at the old disk.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai 5th) Yesterday, various goods from the river arrived at the port on the 8th and 9th. The sales side of the market was slightly inquired about in the early market, and the market turned sluggish in the later market. The market price of white japonica rice was shouted tightly for more than a jiao, and the market returned to tiredness by nearly a jiao in the later market. Yangjian high-quality goods increased by two jiao, and the middle decision was slightly tight. Du Jian was stable, and Hakka Jian was tired. The price of thin indica rice was strong, and the price of Bian Yin Yuan was very good. Dongxin japonica rice arrived again by 12 piculs, and the price still opened at 10.08 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Market Standard Soybean Oil Plunges and Slightly Recovers</h3>
<p>Soybean oil futures plummeted the day before yesterday, causing panic in the market. Subsequently, a rebound was reported from Dalian, restoring market confidence. Short sellers, having already profited, also planned to cover their positions during the small recovery, gradually turning the market around. Closing prices were thirty to fifty cents higher than previous market levels. However, there are still no positive expectations for the immediate market, and most industry participants are not optimistic. Therefore, yesterday's recovery was merely a minor rebound after a significant drop.</p>
<h3>Seafood Sea Cucumber Faces Supply Discontinuity</h3>
<p>Sea cucumber is imported from the East and West. According to industry sources, the total import volume at its peak reached forty to fifty thousand piculs, valued at five to six million yuan. Since the Customs began levying import duties, costs have increased, and foreign production has also significantly decreased compared to the past. A review of the total import volume for the past three years shows that it is less than half of what it used to be. However, prices for all types of goods have soared. New goods are currently being harvested in various regions, but the abundance of the harvest is still uncertain. The stock of old goods held by businesses in the city is dwindling, resulting in incomplete assortments of different grades. When customers need certain items, shortages are often experienced. During this period of supply discontinuity, the market situation for all goods is becoming increasingly tight.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Domestic Sugar Soars</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend for sugar such as coarse granulated and white sugar remained flat and soft. The guild quoted 21.85 yuan for spot coarse granulated and white sugar, 6.9 to 6.8 yuan for transshipment goods, 16.1 yuan for Dutch Red No. 8, OL Mark white bags, and Dongbai No. 489 were quoted at the original prices. Only N K transshipment goods were down five cents to 6.4 yuan. The price of local refined white sugar also remained unchanged. However, domestic sugar continued its upward trend, with a tendency to soar. Refined red sugar rose another forty to fifty cents. Around five hundred packages were offered, with Fuchang fetching 16 yuan, Fuquan Jin Feng 15.6 yuan, and Qilinqing, Song Fa Long Xing, Jun Ji Quan He Yi Ji Guang Cheng, and other brands ranging from 15.4 to 15.5 yuan, settling at 15.1 yuan. Chao Qing, due to rising production costs, was quoted at a high price, with the listing price reaching 15 yuan. In the futures market, Da Chang Foreign Firm offered two thousand bags of Dutch coarse white sugar for August-September shipment at 2.9 Dutch guilders, down slightly from the previous price. Therefore, the foreign sugar market seems to be showing signs of temporary recovery.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods Mingguang New Melon Seeds Arrive in Shanghai; Candied Dates Decline... Jinshan Branches Show Slight Recovery</h3>
<p>New Candied Dates: Since the new Jiaxing candied dates came onto the market, although the daily arrivals have not been large, the market price has gradually declined. The initial price for the first batch was 42 yuan. Yesterday, the initial price was 38 yuan, and later 36 yuan, a total drop of 6 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous Rice Branches: Due to the gradual increase in arrivals and the loosening of listing prices, market prices have fallen by more than ten yuan. Yesterday, the market price was 80 yuan, but competition among businesses was fierce, and a consensus could not be reached, leading to increasing disorder. It is said that there were price fluctuations of several yuan. Since the decline in the price of Jinshan branches, both customer goods and self-operated goods have suffered losses. However, according to yesterday's market situation, the market has shown a slight recovery due to the excessive price reduction. If the goods are of good quality and dry, there seems to be hope for a price increase in the future.</p>
<p>New Melon Seeds: Several pieces of Mingguang new melon seeds arrived yesterday, and a small amount of goods from Linhuaiguan also arrived. They should be available for sale today.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Wide Price Gap Between Chinese and Foreign Silk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silk prices rose in the US and fell in Japan, but the market sentiment remained consistently sluggish. The price difference between foreign silk prices and Shanghai prices was no less than fifty yuan, making it difficult for silk to be exported in the short term. Yesterday, US-bound 83 evenness silk rose six cents, 75 evenness silk remained at the original price, Shanghai 78 evenness silk rose four cents, Guangdong silk saw no price change. New York spot price opened at $1.70, the same as the Saturday market price. Futures rose slightly by half a cent. Yokohama spot prices fell ten yuan, and futures fell three yuan. The markets in Lyon and London were sluggish due to the unrest in Europe. Yesterday, exports from this port were quiet, and domestic sales were limited to scattered transactions.</p>
<p>Shrimp Eye Pearl Tea Sales Still Brisk</p>
<p>Yesterday, the shrimp eye pearl tea from both domestic and foreign tea merchants was still selling well in the tea market. Among them, tightly rolled teas were offered at a top price of 110 yuan, but lower-grade teas were settled at a market price of 50 yuan, presenting a market picture of raising high and suppressing low. However, the market situation for Zhen Mei green tea remained sluggish due to the unsettled situation in Morocco, Africa. The sales of black tea were not very stagnant. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson, Jinlong, and other firms continued to replenish over six hundred boxes of Yichang Qimen black tea, with prices remaining stable.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Tea Trade Association, the tea market remained sluggish yesterday, and transactions were very sparse. Only Jinlong and Tianyu purchased two hundred boxes of Xiao Zhen Mei each, priced at sixteen to twenty-four yuan, a drop of three to four yuan compared to the previous. Xiehe had forty pieces of Gao Zhuang Zhen Mei, with a listed price of eighty-four yuan. Other teas, such as Chou Xin Chang Shang, also sold one or two colors. According to a letter from Hanshang, the tea arrivals in Hubei totaled 125,000 boxes, of which 8,500 boxes were sold, and 3,500 boxes were shipped to Shanghai, sold to Jardine Matheson for thirty-one to thirty-five yuan. The market situation was very poor. The report in yesterday's newspaper that British sales were brisk and that a large amount had been sold was not true.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: The Cotton Cloth Market Has Become Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was sluggish because the price of yarn and cotton fell, and sales from various regions have been sluggish recently. Although there is a lack of spot goods, the market price has remained unchanged. Eastern piece goods have slightly dropped by 2.5 cents per piece. Goods imported into various regions are not selling well, and the market price is difficult to coordinate with the Shanghai market, making additional business intermittent. Printing and dyeing factories still urgently need grey cloth for printing and dyeing, and each factory has a large batch of blue cloth, plain twill, jean, drill, flannel, etc. Customers from various groups are busy placing orders and delivering goods for packaging, but new business has become scarce and sales prices are difficult to increase. Customers from Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guangdong are doing slightly better, with over 200 transactions of plain and patterned drill, jean, crepe, fine cloth, and blue plain twill. Customers from Hankou and Changsha have over 200 transactions of fine cloth, fine twill, and a small number of jean, drill, and crepe. Local wholesale merchants have imported over 100 pieces of fine twill from local factories, and dyeing twill customers have also independently dyed fine twill, with 50 to 60 pieces ordered by customers from Wuhu, Anqing, Fujian, etc. Market price.</p>

The Ministry has made appropriate revisions, which have been announced under Order No. 10680. The points that should be noted are listed below: (1) Elementary schools and affiliated elementary schools of provincial and national universities and colleges should, in accordance with Articles 12 and 13, report the student roster to the local county and city education administrative organs and submit the experimental plans and results to the Ministry annually for verification.

This order is hereby issued."</p>
<h3>Shanghai City's One-Year Report on Implementing Free Education (II): Last Year's Free Education Expenditure Totals 150,000 Yuan; This Year, the Central Government Approves an Allocation of 120,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>(G) Awards and Penalties: In the first semester of the 24th year, the following five schools were commended for their diligent work: Shihua, Haishan, Wanzhu, Feihong Elementary Schools, and Xinlu Normal School. The following ten schools were warned for their poor performance: Qingwei, Zhangmen, Ditang, and Caocun Four Short-Term Elementary Schools, Caonan, Yongxing, Yinxi, Longhua, Wusong, and Tangpan Six Elementary Schools. Zhangzhai Elementary School's attached class, which was the least diligent and had no results, was ordered to be closed. In the second semester, the following four schools were commended for their diligent work: Shihua, Wanzhu, He'an, and Yude Elementary Schools. The following five Short-Term Elementary Schools were warned for their poor performance: Kangqu, Yangzhai, Jiangzhai, Ditang, and Caizhai. The following thirteen schools were warned for their poor performance: Dexin, Zhongshan, Yinhang, Shagang, Juequn, Renji, Yongning, Neidao, Aizhen, Xincun, Honglu, Caonan, and Yinxi. Aidong Elementary School's attached class, which was the least diligent and had no results, was ordered to be closed.</p>
<p>(2) Promoting Elementary Schools: In the first semester of the 24th year, a total of three elementary schools were added. One is Xincun Elementary School, one is Zhangzhai Elementary School, and one is Meiyuan Elementary School. There are a total of five regular grades, three short-term elementary school classes, and one two-part system grade. Excluding the number of students in the short-term elementary school classes, it can accommodate 350 children.</p>
<p>(3) Expanding Existing Grades: In the first semester of the 24th year, a total of 27 grades were added, and in the second semester, a total of 16 grades were added, for a total of 43 grades, which can accommodate 2,150 children.</p>
<p>(4) Vigorously Implementing the Two-Part System: In the first semester of the 24th year, a total of 27 grades were added with the two-part system, and one grade was added in the second semester, for a total of 28 grades, which can accommodate 2,800 children.</p>
<p>(5) Improving Private Schools: This bureau has made every effort to reorganize private schools. In the first semester of the 24th year, the registration of private schools began. A total of 295 schools were registered, and personnel were immediately dispatched to investigate in preparation for improvement. (1) The shortcomings of private schools found in the investigation are mostly: (1) The school buildings are not hygienic; (2) The facilities are too simple; (3) The teachers' knowledge is too low; (4) The teaching materials are inappropriate. Due to the above situation, this bureau decided to reorganize and immediately opened a training class for private school teachers to provide training. A total of 237 private school teachers participated in the training. The training lasted for three months, and 210 people passed the exam, and 27 people failed. The qualified personnel have been issued certificates by this bureau. Wu Xiang and 69 others were rated as Grade A. Wang Zhongqi and 58 others who were absent without reason have been ordered to suspend operations. Qiu Jianzhang and 12 others whose grades were too poor have been ordered to suspend operations. Fang Yonghong and 26 others who were absent from class too much were considered to have failed. This bureau has separately awarded and punished them and severely cracked down on bad private schools.</p>
<p>(5) Trial Implementation of Mobile Education: This city is trying to implement mobile education vehicles to go deep into rural areas to work. Three mobile education vehicles have been set up, each vehicle with a standard of 50 students. The structure and equipment of the vehicles are under the responsible guidance and design of Committee Member Tai Shuangqiu of this association. It is now planned to add electric lights or gas lamps to the vehicles and hang them in the middle of the top of the vehicles for teaching at night. However, the equipment is not yet ready, and nighttime work has not yet started. Starting from the 25th year, it is planned to increase the number of vehicles and further promote this method. A total of 150 children have benefited from the mobile education vehicles. (7) Trial Implementation of Extracurricular Free Education: This bureau has formulated various regulations for extracurricular free education and is preparing to implement them. The current methods have been filed with the Ministry of Education and the Municipal Government. Starting from the 25th year, Gaoqiao District will be designated to start the trial implementation.</p>
<p>General Review of the Past Year</p>
<p>Since the implementation of free education in this city, there have been many difficulties and obstacles in promoting free education. We have used administrative power to minimize some of them, but we have not been able to do it smoothly. Let's calculate the total:</p>
<p>(1) Number of Children: Short-term elementary schools and short-term elementary school classes account for 7,166 people, the promotion of elementary schools accounts for 350 people, the expansion of existing grades accounts for 2,150 people, the vigorous implementation of the two-part system accounts for 2,800 people, and mobile education vehicles account for 150 people. Adding the number of children in expanded existing grades, the total is more than 14,000 people, which is in line with the original plan. (2) Stepping up supervision of schools: The bureau assigned two staff members to specifically oversee, guide, promote and improve free education. Ordinarily, each school must report the grades of students on a score-by-score basis once, and each school conducts home visits. The schools generally are able to make progress step by step.</p>
<p>(2) Solving the difficulties that can be solved: Compulsory education in this city has begun to be implemented for almost a year. The bureau provides immediate guidance and solutions to the practical difficulties encountered by each school. For larger issues, they are submitted to the Free Education Association for discussion. For example, children are often absent, so it is stipulated that students be retained. Children's progress is uneven, so multiple teaching methods should be used. Homework is delayed, so spring break and various holidays are not allowed, and intensive tutoring is given to achieve the planned goals.</p>
<p>(4) Paying attention to rewards and punishments: The personnel engaged in free education work have half the obligation and are more hardworking than ordinary education workers because the children they come into contact with mostly come from poor families. Therefore, for these children with poor family education, the measures taken for management, teaching, and hygiene are more laborious and may not necessarily achieve equally good results. At the same time, because it is a new matter, the facilities and treatment are not the same as ordinary elementary schools, so it is very difficult to achieve good results. This bureau will, of course, provide teachers with as much convenience as possible in all aspects for general children, but teachers must also do their best to serve the society. To encourage them, this bureau has established a system of rewards and punishments to supervise them at any time. In short, the above is a general report on the implementation of compulsory education in this city in the 24th year. For a detailed report, this bureau has printed a "General Report on the Implementation of Compulsory Education in Shanghai," which is currently being typeset. We hope that educators across the country will provide guidance on any inaccuracies. (End)</p>

<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Zhang Feng)</p>
<p>Those who have a home are tired of it, while those who don't long for one, just like those who have relatives are tired of them, while those who don't long for them, sharing the same psychology.</p>
<p>Many who have a home think of it as a burden—a heavy load that's not easy to carry, enough to ruin the future of those with ambition, and entrap the integrity of the honest!</p>
<p>Those who don't have a home mostly admire it as a blessed place—a soft and comfortable setting, enough to comfort you with contentment, and encourage you to move forward with excitement!</p>
<p>Those who have a home but cannot return to it recall the happiness of family life in the past, and dream of it constantly. Those who are away from home as guests are envious of the harmonious family situations of others, especially during festivals. Those in difficult circumstances hold negative views, thinking that things would be better if they left home. In short, things are done by people, and feelings change with circumstances. In fact, a home can be neither loved nor hated.</p>
<p>People endure hardship and toil to make a home, like silkworms spinning silk to make cocoons, settling themselves in a small world organized by themselves!</p>
<h3>On the Pillow</h3>
<p>— Sleeping Buddha</p>
<p>When we put our heads on the pillow, it should be entering the most peaceful and restful state; however, the opposite is often true. When you are busy with work, you feel muddled, neither happy nor sad. But as soon as your head hits the pillow, thoughts, memories, regrets, plans, joys, sorrows, fears... all rush in like a tide. It makes one suspect that this brain, the seat of thought, is not in our head but on the pillow; otherwise, why would it exert its authority and function so greatly as soon as it touches the pillow?</p>
<p>Even if our brain is not on the pillow, I think the pillow should at least be the key to our brain. When this key opens the door of thought, no matter what you hide in the deepest layer, the old and long-lasting shadows and feelings will be brought out without omission. At the same time, if you want to conceive or plan something on the pillow, you will have good success. The ancients had already discovered this. The ancients said that poetry is composed in three "shangs," one of which is "on the pillow." Other examples include improvisations on the pillow and idle chants by the pillow, which often produce better poems. When I was studying at home, I had such a habit: whenever the old teacher gave me a composition topic, I would first spread out the paper and dip the brush as usual, but in the end, I would often scratch my head and not write a single word. So I would run to the bed and lie down, raising the pillow higher. After thinking for twenty or thirty minutes in this way, the complete draft would be ready in my mind, and then I would write it out and submit it, and it would often win praise. Later, composing on the pillow became my "pillow secret" for writing compositions.</p>
<p>In middle age, although I still make a living by writing, the happiness of composing on the pillow has long disappeared. Now, the thoughts stirred up on the pillow are dissatisfied memories and fears of the future. However, I always feel that I have failed the pillow.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think the best use of the pillow is for planning. Isn't everything in front of us in need of planning? So I hope everyone will "raise their pillows higher" and generate some plans on the pillow.</p>
<h3>Toilet</h3>
<p>— Mani</p>
<p>Because what a person excretes has a special smell, it must be placed in a container. This container for storing feces is called a toilet bowl, and the place dedicated to human excretion is the toilet.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, not to mention that earning money is not easy, even excretion is troublesome because you can't excrete on the spot, you have to go to the toilet. And toilets in Shanghai are really hard to find. If you come to Shanghai for the first time, it is difficult to solve the problem of excretion. Even if you find a toilet, you have to buy a ticket (toilet paper) to enter. After all, Shanghai is a civilized place.</p>
<p>Excreting in the toilet, squatting down and putting on a stinky face, seems uncomfortable. Excreting in the toilet bowl at home is always uncomfortable with the smell. Because of this, there are people who have studied the toilet bowl and tried their best to invent a flush toilet, which has no odor, is very comfortable, and is extremely clean. Only a toilet expert can think of a flush toilet.</p>
<p>Shanggang, thirty miles northwest of Yancheng, Subei, still uses the old method because science is not well-developed. The toilets have separate rooms and seats, which are very comfortable and very clean. At each toilet door, there is a plaque with the names Osmanthus Hall, Osmanthus Pavilion, and Yibu Building. Although Shanghai has flush toilets, they are only for the enjoyment of noble people. Toilets like those in Shanggang are suitable for both refined and popular tastes.</p>
<h3>Female Salesperson</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>The fragrance of wine, the aroma of meat, the sound of dice throwing, and the laughter filled the East Flower Hall of a certain restaurant when suddenly, a girl carrying a large rattan basket in her hand, dignified and lively, came in from the windows and doors, stood still, put the rattan basket on an empty table, opened the basket lid, and took out some things from inside and placed them on the table.</p>
<p>This girl looked to be only eighteen or nineteen years old, her face was neither long nor short, perfectly fitting the standard of an oval face. Her skin was quite fair and delicate. She had a little lipstick on her lips. Her hair was loosely permed and tied with a red ribbon. Her figure was so slender. So as soon as she entered the door, she silenced the shouts of more than thirty gentlemen-style guests in the whole room, who rushed to the empty table, surrounding the girl with concern. Old Grandpa Li, who was over sixty years old, Old Xu, who was limping, Dr. Yang, who often cursed women, and Director Wu, who claimed to have never been interested in women in fifty years, all squeezed into the crowd, craning their necks and staring desperately.</p>
<p>"What's going on? What is she doing here?" Little Yu, who was particularly short and had thick glasses on his nose, squeezed behind the people, desperately trying to push forward, asking this question.</p>
<p>"A salesperson from ××× Pharmacy, selling ×× pills," the person standing in front told him. Then, the female salesperson also opened her mouth, using a rhythmic tone, skillfully and pleasingly describing the effectiveness of the medicine and the low price. Finally, she looked around with a pair of black eyes hiding under her slender eyebrows, and raised several packages of medicine, waiting to be purchased. But none of the thirty or so gentlemen made a move, except to look at each other.</p>
<p>"Hehehe, Miss, if you can drink a glass of wine for me, I promise to buy three packs from you?" Little Yu squinted his eyes behind the thick glass lenses and said, breaking the surrounding silence and causing everyone to laugh. Everyone laughed heartily, preparing to see the female salesperson's embarrassment. But unexpectedly, she not only did not show any embarrassment but even stretched out her hand to ask for wine. She not only drank the glass given to her by Little Yu but also drank six or seven glasses in succession. Later, she simply picked up the wine pot, poured herself a glass, and led everyone in the room to toast her. Laughter rang out again in this East Flower Hall, mixed with the female salesperson's loudest laughter.</p>
<p>Finally, she placed three large packages of the medicine she was selling in front of everyone. Everyone had to obediently take out one yuan of legal currency. Before long, she sold more than thirty yuan, thanked everyone happily, and went to sell elsewhere with her rattan basket. After she left, Little Yu suddenly clapped his hands on his legs and exclaimed in surprise, "Oh, I forgot to ask her what her name is and where she lives!" His face, full of wine, showed a look of frustration, followed by another burst of hearty laughter from everyone.</p>
<h3>Goldfish Musings</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>Grafting goldfish, as I mentioned briefly in my previous article, I have tried it this spring. At this time, the young fish are beginning to show their characteristics. There are several types, including "bubble-eye evert", "five-flower piled jade", "blue piled jade", "western egg bubble", and "western egg skygazer". After repeated selection, only a few are neat and beautiful. I am still glad that I have not given up hope.</p>
<p>"Five-color small goldfish" are a mixture of blue, purple, five-flower, western dragon, and western egg varieties. Because the blue and purple varieties are naturally colored when they hatch, they are particularly beautiful. As for the five-flower, western dragon, and western egg varieties, they are also colored from a young age, unlike other varieties that do not change to red until three to five months later. Mr. Xian Guansheng, feeling that "five-color small goldfish" can be used to decorate elegant rooms, specially ordered thousands of high-footed glass cups to hold the colorful fish, which are displayed in the six stores of each branch, and the price is very low, to attract customers to use them as a refreshing pastime in the summer.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Jianyun, manager of the Star Film Company, returned from Europe and the West with Hu Die, loyal to the silver kingdom, and improved the Star. He worked hard for a year and finally succeeded. This time, he recruited talents extensively and expanded greatly, especially credited with labor. Furthermore, he does everything personally and has no spare time. Recently, he has eliminated unnecessary social interactions and spends his free time cultivating fish and birds for regulation. Those who enter his room see brocade scales splashing and good birds chirping, and can imagine his elegance. Mr. Zhou once visited western aquariums, saying that the fish tanks there are built into the walls, with whole pieces of glass on the left and right, with water stored inside, and decorated with electric candles, so that the special swimming fish are all visible. The bottom of the water is covered with colored stones and planted with algae, as if one is in the seabed. The water is constantly flowing, so the fish are safe, and planting algae is also for ventilation. Now, his residence has two glass tanks, one for European tropical fish, with various colors and more varieties than our Chinese goldfish, and one for Chinese five-color goldfish, with no less than ten varieties. Because the equipment is beautiful and the water is clean, it is pleasing to look at.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Wanming, a magnate in the dyeing industry in Shanghai, is deeply interested in raising fish in his spare time. He values the quality of fish over the quantity. He once told me that if you want the fish to be fat, you can buy rice wine, remove the coarse particles, and then steam it in a rice pot. Give it a little every day, which is better than giving it water maggots every day. Don't change the water too often, but add clear water every few days. The results have been very good for the past two years. The fish from last year have now grown to five inches. It is not easy for a private fish to grow so large.</p>
<p>The book "Goldfish Raising Method" is more practical and has become very popular. Now, the third edition is published. Now that the mildew season has just passed and it is easy to raise goldfish, all my friends in Hao Liang should have a copy in hand. Those who send ten cents of legal currency to Yanling Jilu, No. 269 Dajie, Caohejing Town, will immediately receive a copy.</p>
<h3>A Phoenix Replaces the Nest</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Sight and Sound are Fleeting Doubts Recur; Life and Death Can be Entrusted, Generously Sending Dirges</p>
<p>When I returned home in the evening, I met Miss Li on the road. I greeted her respectfully, and she seemed very sincere. Seeing the joy on her face, it was even more evident that she had no malicious intent when she questioned me about the paintings. Actually, I was dizzy as if I were drunk, and then I fell into deep thought again. When the evening lights came on, my thoughts became obsessive, and I didn't know what I was trying to do, so I circled around your neighborhood three times. In the dark alley, two people bought lamps to go to the market, and they whispered that Miss Li's pain came from living in a small building, opening the window to admire the moon all night. I thought to myself, who else but you could have such different views. Outside your house wall, there is a small garden with two tall willow trees. I stood under the willows and looked around, and I could see a corner of the small building, with the lights dimly lit. I knew it was meaningless, but I didn't understand why I was doing it. It's just that you can know that what I seek is comfort for my soul, not to be a frivolous and unrestrained person. This matter is not worth telling you, because telling you might only increase your avoidance of me. However, from now on, I will never do it again. Since you don't allow me to write letters, I shouldn't write this letter, but I am sending this letter to show the readers that I am not discouraged by your rejection of me. After you receive this letter, it's okay if you don't see me, and it's okay if you greet me with anger, but I know that you like to read the novels I write, so I will try harder to create more refined works to meet your expectations. Although there have been these two letters back and forth, I worry that you may no longer like to read my articles because of this. However, this is not something I can worry about. I think that if this can slightly comfort my soul, I will do it, otherwise, I will be unable to arrange myself. I don't know if the sick Miss Li I heard about is you. If it is you, then I dare to say that you should strive to be strong, eliminate your hidden pain, and fight for freedom. If you need anything, I will go through fire and water without hesitation. I have written thousands of words, but I still haven't expressed my full meaning, so I will write a short poem to make up for it.</p>
<p>I wish to be a green-feathered bird, nesting in the willow outside your building, without fearing the peach and plum trees, watching the door all day long.</p>
<p>I wish to be a purple bronze mirror, placed on your dressing table, serving your appearance all year round, not allowing any dust to fall on it.</p>
<p>I wish to be a blue frost sword, accompanying you on a long journey in the sea of people, flashing a three-foot light, cutting down injustice for you.</p>
<p>I wish to be the moon in the sky, reuniting every year, forever illuminating the pearl curtains, not allowing you to be unhappy.</p>
<p>I wish to be a monthly rose, blooming every morning in the old garden, meeting you every day, always making you happy.</p>
<p>I wish to be the wind and clouds, making your steps quick, not worrying about the bumps in the road, stepping onto the path of freedom.</p>
<p>I couldn't sleep all night, and my sorrowful thoughts surged. I still want to say more, but I fear my words will be messy. However, with just these few poems, I see that life and death can be entrusted. Knowing me or blaming me, I will prove it in the future. Respectfully presented to Miss Li, Jian, Litian bows a hundred times (57)</p>

<h3>The Life After Joining the Farmers' Ranks</h3>
<p>— Song Tingdong</p>
<p>One of the hottest mornings, school started its summer vacation. Many students packed their luggage, busy going home. Only a few of us intern students, carrying extremely simple luggage, took rickshaws and set off towards the remote countryside.</p>
<p>Among these students, some wore worried expressions, knowing there would be more hardship than joy in this trip; others were very happy, because they had already made up their minds, preparing to bury themselves in hard work. As the vehicles passed through the city and arrived in the vast countryside, some students even fell asleep in the rickshaws. The remaining few talked and laughed, encouraging each other not to become rural locusts on this trip.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the experimental district, the director-general assigned each person a place for their internship. After eating lunch in the district, we immediately parted ways. In that moment of separation, we were truly saddened, unable to express the feelings in our hearts.</p>
<p>I was assigned to the Dangli Dang Fourth People's School. As soon as I entered, I was shocked. Inside were broken tiles and dilapidated walls, truly resembling the mountain villa for coffins at the foot of Mount Hui. The bedroom could only accommodate a bed, and the damp, musty air constantly surged into my nostrils, making it hard to breathe. Recalling the time when I lived in the school dormitory, complaining about the bad screens and mosquito bites, complaining about the simple facilities and lack of hygiene, compared to this, there was truly a world of difference.</p>
<p>It has been two weeks under these living conditions, and I already feel very comfortable. I have gotten to know many old farmers, and several village children have become very close to me. They all said in unison, "This teacher is not bad at all."</p>
<p>The life in the countryside is originally very interesting. When your spirit is comforted, coming to this countryside and being with the old farmers, not admiring vanity, not loving prosperity, the natural beauty of the clear morning and moonlit night is truly endless to appreciate. In the city, there is truly a sense of sitting in a well and looking at the sky. In the countryside, looking far and wide, there is no end in sight. White clouds rise, changing in a myriad of ways, unfathomable; the setting sun is about to fall, the sky is full of red neon, breathtakingly beautiful. Cicadas on the trees and frogs in the fields sing to each other, calling for prices to be heard, truly making you feel that the music in the movie theater is unbearably vulgar. By the clear stream, you can practice swimming; on White Dan Mountain, you can train for a healthy run. When tired, you can take a nap in the forest; when in high spirits, you can help the farmers plant rice in the paddy fields. In the bamboo forest, under the roots of old trees, sipping fragrant tea and reading newspapers, isn't this a wonderful realm? The joys and sorrows of life originally have no standard. At the same time, because each person's concept of enjoyment is different, the sufferer thinks it is joy, and the joyful thinks it is suffering. Who is right and who is wrong? This can only be understood and appreciated by each person themselves.</p>
<p>There are many problems with farmers in the countryside. As long as you are willing to study them, problems are everywhere waiting for you to solve. There are many social evils in the countryside. If you are willing to work hard, there are careers everywhere waiting for you to strive for. One afternoon, I participated in the founding meeting of a cooperative. Their spirit was very good, and the discussion items were quite organized. In my heart, I thought, who says the Chinese people are hopeless? It's a pity that these useful people have never been noticed! They asked me to give a speech. Although I was not prepared, I was very willing to tell these pure and lovely people: first, the organization must be strict; second, things must have a beginning and an end; third, they must be able to sacrifice private interests for the public good. They were very happy. Finally, the discussion of cooperative farming methods and the method of purchasing bean cakes in batches were quite appropriate. As long as the people who lead the Chinese people are willing to sacrifice everything to be their mentors and put their energy as much as possible into them, after a year, the power of the Chinese people will be cultivated. Who would dare to covet us? I don't believe that China will always be the oldest, useless, invaded, and trampled on. As long as we have knowledgeable mentors, make up our minds, and work hard to awaken the people, sacrifice our energy, and train a large number of promising people, the revival of the Chinese nation is bound to be hopeful! Friends! I hope you can all make up your minds and strive towards this path. Empty talk is not enough to save the country. Only burying yourself in hard work is a down-to-earth method! Friends! I represent the farmers in welcoming your arrival!</p>

<h3>How to Save the Misfortune of National Products</h3>
<p>— Yimin</p>
<p>In the last ten days of last month, representatives from chambers of commerce in various provinces and cities held a joint meeting in Shanghai. In addition to passing important resolutions such as organizing the Committee for the Inspection of Smuggling in Various Regions of the Republic of China and petitioning the Ministry of Finance to temporarily postpone the levy of income tax, there was also an extremely important resolution, which was to request the government to issue an order to protect the transportation and sale of legitimate goods.</p>
<p>The so-called legitimate goods undoubtedly naturally refer to national products. In recent years, the matter of promoting national products has changed from the cry of a few people into a widespread movement, from the promotion in cities to affecting towns, almost everyone knows it. However, up to today, why has the national product industry not progressed and even deteriorated? Some say that because national products are poorly manufactured and expensive, the blame lies with the industrial and commercial sectors. Others say that most Chinese people lack a national concept, only seeking cheapness. They think that all foreign goods are good, and they don’t care about the impact of using foreign goods on the country. Therefore, the nationals who purchase foreign goods should bear the blame for the declining national product industry. Both of these statements can be said to be reasonable, but they are not the most fundamental reason. The fundamental reason is that the government has not been able to provide sufficient convenience and maintenance for national products everywhere!</p>
<p>First, let's talk about factories. We know that anyone who runs a factory, unless they are mentally ill, who wouldn’t want their products to be better than other people's? But in fact, some national products are indeed of poor quality. What is the reason for this? To answer this question, we can explore the reasons why foreign goods are excellent. It is said that the government spares no effort in maintaining the manufacture of foreign industrial products. If there is a shortage of capital, you can ask the government for help. If there are foreign goods coming to compete, the government will find ways to resist them for you. If there is any new invention, the government will give you a bonus. If you want to promote sales abroad, the government will help you in front. They have all kinds of conveniences, so naturally they can not worry about everything and wholeheartedly study the manufacturing of products. And what about our Chinese factories? On the one hand, they have to plan the turnover of finance, and on the other hand, they are worried about the market being taken away by others. They have no surplus funds to equip new machinery and recruit specialized talents, and they have to reverse the cost and cannot use good raw materials. As a result, naturally, they can only act hastily. To say that factories have no responsibility at all is certainly not possible; but to say that factories deliberately produce shoddy goods is not reasonable.</p>
<p>Secondly, let's talk about commercial firms. To be honest, the purpose of merchants selling goods is to seek profit. As long as that kind of goods is cheap to buy and easy to sell, they will import that kind of goods. This is naturally very reasonable. Because national products have heavy taxes and high manufacturing costs, merchants abandon them and choose foreign goods that are easy to sell. Are they unpatriotic? I dare not say that there are no people who are willing to be traitors; but I believe that most commercial firms are reluctantly abandoning national products. Finally, it is time to talk about users. Among users, except for a part of quasi-traitors who are superstitious about foreign goods and put the country and nation behind their minds, 99% of them have no choice but to purchase foreign goods. Because foreign goods use unequal treaties as a talisman, the taxes on their sales in our country are lighter than those on our own goods. In addition, their governments reward them with refunds of raw material taxes, so their prices are cheaper than ours, and the quality is excellent. In this way, Chinese people will naturally adopt them. If we say that patriotic compatriots should endure the pain and pay a high price to purchase national products, this cannot be done, and even if it can be done, it cannot be maintained permanently. Because it is human nature to be greedy for cheapness, and the quality is good; you tell him to abandon cheap and good foreign goods and not buy them. It is said that it is still ineffective in advanced countries where the level of people's knowledge is higher than ours. To tell greedy and foolish Chinese people to pay a high price to buy inferior goods is simply an idiot's dream!</p>
<p>Therefore, don't talk about promoting national products, otherwise, we must first ask the government to maintain them. In recent years, although the government has been much more concerned about the national product industry than before, the obvious ones, such as the number of highways established in various provinces, the abolition of likin, the reform of the currency system, and the holding of industrial mortgage loans, have all been implemented one after another; however, this is not enough. What the industrial and commercial sectors urgently hope for at present is to refund raw material taxes, cut and eliminate transit taxes, thoroughly eliminate the exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes of disguised likin in various provinces, reduce national land and water transportation costs, increase import taxes on foreign goods, and eliminate tax evasion and smuggled goods. Only in this way can the misfortune of national products be saved, and only in this way can there be a glimmer of hope for national vitality!</p>
<p>The time has come to the final life-and-death juncture. With the greatest enthusiasm, we hope that the wise government authorities will adopt and implement the requests of this joint meeting of the chamber of commerce.</p>
<p>A Word of Contribution</p>
<h3>Industries That Can Be Done What Others Have Not Done</h3>
<p>— Yang'an</p>
<p>—Olympics and Mr. Wu Yun Chu—</p>
<p>Our national products participated in the International Labor Olympic Games last year. Among the first-class awards won, the award recipient was designated as Mr. Wu Yun Chu, manager of Shanghai Tianchu MSG Factory. This award was sent by the chairman of the conference to our embassy in Belgium and then transferred to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which then sent it to the Ministry of Industry for distribution. On the sixth of last month, the Ministry of Industry held a special award ceremony. This glorious event is not only the honor of Mr. Wu alone, but also the glory of all of China and the entire nation.</p>
<p>I once said that Chinese people like to speculate, imitate, enjoy the existing situation, and do things that everyone does. Therefore, in any industry, there are fewer inventors and more copycats, fewer successful people and more failures. Especially in today's national product industry, whenever a new industry emerges, countless people envy its huge profits, and then follow suit, resulting in supply exceeding demand, and the result is that everyone perishes together, or gives foreign goods an opportunity to take advantage of. The lack of protection for inventors and the difficulty in creating new businesses are extremely heartbreaking to say. If this kind of bad mentality is not eliminated one day, it will not be easy to develop the Chinese national product industry one day.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Yun Chu has been engaged in the chemical industry for more than 20 years. He has a great interest in chemistry and has made many contributions. In total, the businesses he has initiated, such as Tianchu MSG, Tianyuan Hydrochloric Acid, Bleaching Powder, Caustic Soda, Chichang Colloid, and the recently opened Tianli Nitrogen, are all industries that others have not done, industries that are not easy for others to do. He does not imitate or speculate. He has gone through countless difficulties and used countless spiritual strengths to manage diligently and achieve success. Moreover, these several industries are all basic industries of the country, industries that are extremely related to national defense, and have made great contributions to society, the country, and the nation. This is truly worthy of admiration and worship. The Olympic award is just the beginning. I deeply hope that Mr. Wu will continue to build on his interest in the chemical industry. In the future, the society's reward and commemoration of Mr. Wu, as well as the country's and the world's rewards and encouragement to Mr. Wu, will be limited? Or even more, "Shun is also a man, and I am also a man. If he can do it, I can also do it." I hope that domestic chemists, as well as all industrialists, will make good use of their brains and spirits, think about creating, think about inventing, and follow in the footsteps of Mr. Wu, and also have all kinds of construction, and be able to do industries that others have not done, to repay society, the country, and the world, and to wash away the shame of Chinese people who only know how to enjoy the existing and do not know how to create. Then the brilliance of China's new industry will be even more brilliant. In the history of inventions all over the world, we Chinese will occupy a huge page. What kind of glory is that? Encourage Mr. Wu, encourage the country's chemists and industrialists, they also hear the wind and rise up, and continue to make progress?</p>
<h3>The Mat Industry in Taizhou</h3>
<p>— Sun Linchang</p>
<p>Taizhou is located in the territory of Lin'an County, Zhejiang Province. Its terrain is backed by mountains and faces water. It has always been known for producing mats. Therefore, among all grass mats, there is the name Taizhou Mat. However, mats sold at sea are proclaimed as Taiwan mats. However, they do not know that Taiwan has no mat grass and no one weaves mats. Therefore, the word "Taiwan" is actually a mistake for "Taizhou." This may be because the original perpetrators showed an exaggerated tone because Taiwan was farther away, so they used it as a slogan. Later generations have accumulated habits and followed suit. The word "Taiwan" has almost become a fixed term for grass mats, while the real Taizhou mats are buried and not known. Therefore, I especially correct them here.</p>
<p>Taizhou mats have fine, long, and soft mat grass, so the products are smooth and durable. The diameter of the coarse side of the mat is woven from Longxucao grass. This grass is produced from local mountain valleys, shaped like cattails but fine. Taizhou mats have these two characteristics, so they are not as good as other mats.</p>
<p>The raw materials for Taizhou mats are planted by local farmers. Each household has several mu or dozens of mu. Sowing in early spring and harvesting in autumn. After drying, they can be applied. The weaving machine is made of wood, with a simple structure, shaped like the character "井". There is a wooden shuttle and a bamboo Tongcao knife. When weaving, one person holds the shuttle and one person passes the Tongcao. The days are long in summer and autumn. Each machine can weave four mats per day. The days are short in spring and winter. Also, because the weather is cold and frozen, the mat grass must be soaked in water before it can be applied. Therefore, each machine can only weave three mats per day. On average, each machine can produce more than 1,280 mats per year. According to the calculation of more than 1,530 machines in the whole county, 1,960 bundles of mats should be produced each year. (100 mats per bundle) In addition to selling this item to neighboring counties, local people mostly hoard them at home, waiting for mat vendors to buy them and transport them to Shanghai and Hangzhou for resale to various ports.</p>

<h3>Promoting National Products is Not About Just Talking</h3>
<p>— Master of Yiyiguan</p>
<p>"Promoting national products is not about just talking." In other words, "promoting national products" requires practical work. It is not just empty words that can achieve results.</p>
<p>Originally, we Chinese people only have one mouth, which is the most brilliant. No matter what, not only is it this matter of "promoting national products," they only know how to talk about it, but do not know how to do it in practice. Therefore, for decades, everyone still cannot help but shout the slogan of "promoting national products" to persuade people to promote "national products." And there are still "foreign goods" for sale on the market, and there are still people who want to buy "foreign goods!" Thinking about it carefully, this cannot be blamed on everyone only knowing how to talk about it, but not knowing how to do it in practice.</p>
<p>I remember someone once said this: "The British only do and don't talk, the Germans do and then talk, the Japanese talk and then do, and the Chinese only talk and don't do." These few words really hit the nail on the head! Looking at it this way, what else is there to blame for the fact that others are getting richer and stronger every day, while we are getting poorer and weaker every day?</p>
<p>Alas! Now let's stop talking nonsense. In short, even if we cannot "only do and don't talk," even if we cannot "do and then talk," well, at the very least, we should "talk and then do," and don't always be like this "only talk and don't do."</p>
<p>You must know that if you "only talk and don't do" in everything, you will "achieve nothing in your life." Especially "promoting national products" is not just about relying on one mouth!</p>

<h3>Lost Virginity!</h3>
<p>For what motives did unmarried young people lose their virginity? What kind of woman was the object of it? It would be interesting to study these.</p>
<p>But generally speaking, young people lose their virginity to prostitutes because of the impulse of sexual desire. The age of the youths losing their virginity are mostly from eighteen to twenty years old, which is a real cause for concern. Moreover, most of them lose their virginity by visiting prostitutes, which is even more worrying. Look at the following letter from a young man, how tragic and cruel!</p>
<p>Editor: I am a shop assistant in my twenties. One autumn night last year, I experienced a strong stimulation of my reproductive organs, which made me unable to sleep all night. The second night, to avoid this pain, I went to practice prostitution. This was my first time trying love. I knew this was a dangerous act, but how could I withstand the burning of desire? From then on, disaster came. I not only lost my virginity, but also the germs of venereal disease contaminated my pure blood. In less than seven days, I broke out with white turbidity, and I felt an unprecedented tingling when urinating. The urethral opening was swollen and red, and a white milky mucus was constantly flowing out. The penis did not stretch freely, and it was extremely painful when it was erect, and it would always be erect. I was in so much pain that it was difficult to fall asleep. At that time, due to my profession, I kept it absolutely secret and secretly bought several kinds of gonorrhea medicine, but unfortunately it still had no effect. I had to ask a doctor for consultation again, and it was said that it had already turned into chronic. The treatment was very troublesome and required a total medical cost of sixty yuan. Of course, I did not have such money, so I had to endure it. At this time, although the pain was reduced, the gonorrhea still flowed out. After six months, not only did my body become increasingly weak, but I would also have nocturnal emissions from time to time. I felt dizzy during the day, my movements were tired, and my muscles were so thin that I was not like a human being. I thought if I didn't find a way, I was afraid that it would affect my job. Therefore, I told my friend everything about my condition. He told me that I could try "Antilin," which is made by mixing yellow pigment and vaccine, because a colleague had been cured before. At the same time, he told me that if I felt weak, then I must take "Reproduction Element," and if there were nocturnal emissions, then "Ximitos Solid Essence Tablets" could cure them. I had never used these three medicines before, so I trusted him very much and bought them. Sure enough, in less than three weeks, white turbidity and nocturnal emissions were cured one after another. Moreover, after taking "Reproduction Element," my body was very strong, and my spirit was unusually excited. Therefore, my job was still maintained, otherwise it would be ominous!

<p>Couple's Knowledge</p>
<p>— Special article by Doctor Yu Bofu</p>
<h3>Neglected Post-marital Weakness</h3>
<p>The reasons for post-marital physical weakness and other dangers Excessive sexual desire can slow down metabolic function The way to save infertility and neurasthenia</p>
<p>Marriage is inevitable in the minds of most people. Therefore, post-marital health is really worth discussing and researching. Generally speaking, the main conditions for marital harmony are will and physique. The original so-called will is the quality given by the physique. To put it thoroughly, those with strong physique have strong will, and those with weak physique have weak will. The so-called will is controlled by the physique. Therefore, physique is an important foundation for marital harmony.</p>
<p>If the physique is weak and sick or infertile, it often becomes the fuse for a breakdown between husband and wife, and the family is rarely complete, and happiness is completely lost!</p>
<p>Those who have always been weak or have suffered from neurasthenia will find that the degree of weakness becomes deeper and deeper after marriage. There are also those who were very healthy before marriage, but after marriage, their bodies become thinner, their vitality fades, their muscles become thinner, and all kinds of neurasthenia occur one after another. Marriage is originally a happy exploration. If after marriage, not only is what is expected not realized, but it is harmful to the body, what an unfortunate thing this is! We carefully investigate these reasons. Among people who are weak after marriage, in addition to the problem of incorrect physical coordination, most of them are due to sexual indulgence. Because marriage is the beginning of the realization of sexual love, they gradually enter the realm of joy, the fire of youthful desire burns, and they cannot be restrained. Unconsciously, they damage their precious bodies, resulting in a sickly appearance. As a result, men are prone to impotence, premature ejaculation, and neurasthenia. In addition to neurasthenia, women also suffer from menstrual irregularities. If the body is too weak, vaginal discharge cannot be avoided. The hope of pregnancy is rarely realized.</p>
<p>In short, to eliminate this obstacle, whether before or after marriage, you can use the method of cultivating and nourishing the reproductive glands to remedy it, because people with strong reproductive glands also have healthy metabolic functions. For example, the "Reproduction Element" oral medicine invented by Austrian physiologist Staner, which is made by extracting the reproductive gland hormone from young animals, has a special effect on cultivating and nourishing the human body's reproductive glands. It can accelerate the body's metabolic functions, restore decline, and help every man and woman have strong performance. The harms of impotence, premature ejaculation, menstrual irregularities, and post-marital infertility can all be quickly resolved with its transcendent medicinal power without any difficulty. Therefore, the special ingredients of "Reproduction Element" have almost become a powerful element for people's life and health.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Supplement on Bone Pain Treatment</h3>
<p>— Physician Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>What is bone pain?  It includes waist pain, soreness, achiness, aching joints, muscle tendon pain, brain bone stabbing pain, etc., all collectively referred to as bone pain. These are all caused by the accumulation of wind dampness and the gradual accumulation of heat toxins over time.  Therefore, the onset of this disease is by no means achievable in the short term.</p>
<p>Therefore, people who are usually overworked and those with weak constitutions are prone to this disease.  In addition, unclean blood and excessive uric acid are even more likely to cause this disease, because after the blood is unclean, the uric acid in the blood often transforms into uric acid crystals shaped like tiny shards of broken glass.  If they remain in the bones, it causes bone pain; if they enter the tendons, it causes tendon spasms; if they enter the muscles, it causes muscle wasting; if they enter the limbs, it causes limb numbness.  In severe cases, the whole body may fall into hemiplegia, and in mild cases, one cannot bear the pain.</p>
<p>The patient, Chu Mingzhi, is 40 years old and has suffered from bone pain for eight years.  Last winter, it broke out particularly severely, causing pain throughout his body, and his movements became unnatural.  Sometimes his muscles and tendons felt constricted and painful, and his limbs were stiff.  He was very afraid, and although he took many kinds of bone pain medicine, it was still ineffective.  It was not until the end of this spring that he was introduced by a friend to purchase and take about six boxes of "Dr. Stearns' Bone Pain Tablets" from the Wuzhou Pharmacy, and he saw great results.  Since the beginning of summer, for three months, it has not recurred, and he feels nothing even in cloudy and rainy weather. Therefore, the miraculous effect of "Dr. Stearns' Bone Pain Tablets" cannot be matched by other medicines.</p>
<h3>Clinical Case Records from the Venereal Disease and Smoking Cessation Department</h3>
<p>— Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine from the University of Hong Kong, recorded</p>
<p>(1) Gonorrhea Infecting Wife</p>
<p>The patient is a bookkeeper at a laundry and dyeing shop, surnamed Wei, from Nanxiang, Suzhou, currently 31 years old. He enjoys womanizing, so he often indulges in licentious activities. (Chief Complaint) - He suffers from gonorrhea that was improperly treated, repeatedly seeking non-specific therapies from quack doctors, all of which were ineffective, leading to repeated relapses of gonorrhea.  This year, he engaged in unclean sexual intercourse again, and his wife was infected early on. Now the couple is suffering from gonorrheal discharge. He should have brought his wife for consultation, but his wife insisted on not coming, so he had to come alone to seek medical help.  Currently, my symptoms are swollen testicles and abnormal pain. (Medical History) - Mr. Wei said that in early February, he accepted a friend's invitation to play mahjong at a certain hotel on Liu Ma Road. Among them, a tea servant from one of the mahjong parlors, surnamed Ye, whom I knew, told me that recently there was a beautiful prostitute from the capital, who was good at singing Qing opera. She claimed to be a courtesan from the Confucius Temple, and because business was slow, she came to Shanghai to change her line of work. I like Qing opera, and hearing that there was an unexpected bargain, I gladly summoned her. Unexpectedly, after three spring nights, the gonorrhea was so severe that I had to seek a thorough cure. (Treatment) - In addition to advising him on health maintenance methods, in order to prevent the testicles from shaking, I used a suspensory to support them. I also instructed him to purchase "Anti-Gonorrhea" from Wing On Company, which is a medicine made from a mixture of yellow pigment and vaccines, and told the couple to take it at the same time, and firmly instructed them not to interrupt it absolutely. They must take at least four boxes. Other restrictions on bowel movements, diet, and labor are extremely strict. After about five weeks, Mr. Wei's wife and Mr. Wei's aggravated orchitis were completely cured.</p>
<p>(2) Relieving Stomach Pain and Quitting Smoking Addiction</p>
<p>The patient is a middle-aged woman, 35 years old, with a deep addiction to smoking opium. She became addicted at the age of 26. (Chief Complaint) - Due to stomach pain, she became addicted to smoking. Recently, the stomach pain still occurs frequently, and it is difficult to quit smoking. She suffers from insomnia and restlessness, and has a severe vaginal discharge. (Medical History) - When she first started smoking, she felt that the stomach pain was relieved, and I was overjoyed, thinking that the stomach disease that had not been cured for many years would be gone one day. Unexpectedly, two years later, the stomach pain recurred, and at the same time, my amount of smoking also increased day by day. Now I want to return to my hometown for a long time, but the prohibition of smoking is very strict in the countryside, so I have to urgently seek to quit. (Treatment) - I instructed her to purchase and take "Stomach Pain Relief" from Huamei Pharmacy to treat her stomach disease, and apply "Discharge Relief" to stop the vaginal discharge. Then, I used the tonic and smoking cessation medicine "Germinal Essence" to eliminate her smoking addiction. In order to reduce her suffering, I injected "Yuwei Cibaoming". With these several prescriptions taking care of everything, in less than three months, the stomach pain was cured, and the smoking addiction was safely quit. The vaginal discharge disappeared from then on. Now she has boarded a ship to return to her hometown, and from then on she has escaped from the dark register.</p>
<h3>Reasonable Cure for Nocturnal Emission and Spermatorrhea</h3>
<p>— Physician Wang Shiying</p>
<p>A man's semen is stored in the seminal vesicles. Then, desires are strong, and the penis erects, because the semen absorbed by the vesicle is thick and sensitive, and it is very easy to overflow. This is the reason for nocturnal emission in healthy people. Therefore, even without sexual intercourse, nocturnal emission can occur unintentionally.</p>
<p>People who commit masturbation are bound to suffer from neurasthenia and sexual dysfunction. Therefore, the ejaculation nerve center becomes overly sensitive, so ejaculation will occur immediately with the slightest stimulation. The main reason is that the vas deferens is relaxed and the seminal gate is not firm. This is called pathological nocturnal emission. When it worsens, semen will slip out unconsciously, and there will be the following symptoms: muscle weakness, physical weakness, indigestion, foul breath, pale complexion, drowsy and dull eyes, hypersensitivity, decreased intelligence and memory, deep feelings of terror and grief, headaches, tinnitus, and the body often feels tremors and is abnormally thin.</p>
<p>In short, whether physiological or pathological, it is ultimately harmful and unhelpful to the body. The way to cure it is to take "Himito's Semen Consolidating Pills" to nourish the seminal gate and cure nocturnal emission. At the same time, it is best to take "Germinal Essence" to repair the damaged reproductive function. This is the most reasonable way to cure it, and its effectiveness is faster than any other method.</p>
<p>Itching and Vaginal Discharge</p>
<p>Sir: I have been suffering from white discharge for three years, and the flow is very large and has a strange odor, so I am unclean all year round, and the itching is unbearable. Although I wash it every day, it is not effective. If this continues, I will never be able to eliminate it. I have tried many kinds of medicines before, but they have all failed. Please tell me a treatment method, I am very grateful.</p>
<p>(Asked by Zhou Shiying)</p>
<p>(Answer) You can buy "Itching Discharge Relief" from Wing On Company and apply it, and you will be cured. If it is due to physical weakness, then take "Female Germinal Essence".</p>
<p>Weakness and Stomach Pain</p>
<p>I have always been weak, and I have felt stomach pain since middle age. At the same time, I have a poor appetite, and I often vomit sour water in the morning. I feel stomach pain as soon as I am slightly full. I usually feel nauseous and vomit, and my spirit is very bad, so I smoke to relieve it. Unexpectedly, I became addicted to smoking, but the stomach pain has not been relieved. Please ask what medicine I can take to cure the stomach pain, increase appetite, and quit smoking. (Zhang Chengzhong)</p>
<p>(Answer) You can take "Stomach Pain Relief" to treat stomach pain, then take "Stomach Strengthening Essence" to help increase appetite, and then take the smoking cessation remedy "Germinal Essence" to eliminate the smoking addiction. It will be effective very quickly.</p>
<p>Fertility Issues</p>
<p>I am 30 years old this year, and I got married in the spring of 24th year. I had a habit of masturbation since I was 22 years old, and I only quit after marriage. But after marriage, I suffer from erection at the sight of beauty, and there is semen outflow, and ejaculation occurs after only one or two minutes of intercourse. May I ask if there is any hope of fertility? What medicine is effective? (Sincerely asked by Shang Chengzhi)</p>
<p>(Answer) This is called sexual neurasthenia, which is the result of early masturbation. "Germinal Essence" is the most effective medicine. You can take it three times a day, and you will be able to restore your strength and reproduce normally.</p>
<p>Smoking Cessation Lessons</p>
<p>I became addicted to smoking when I was 21 years old, and my parents found out and ordered me to quit. Although I tried all kinds of medicines, none of them worked. It was not until I was 33 years old this year that I was able to quit after taking "Germinal Essence". When I first tried it, I took it three times a day. After about three weeks, I felt that the amount of smoking was sharply reduced. In less than two months, I completely quit. I only took six boxes of medicine in total. I was fortunate to have quit my ten-year-old addiction in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Lower Back Pain</p>
<p>I have had lower back pain for a year, and it has become more severe since this spring. I have taken medicine and had electrotherapy, and it sometimes gets better and sometimes gets worse. I have never been able to cure it completely. I am writing to ask what medicine I should take to prevent it from recurring.</p>
<p>(Sun Zhiming, Pudong)</p>
<p>(Answer) Your illness needs to be diagnosed before we can know the exact cause. However, to avoid the pain of bone pain, you can take "Dr. Stearns' Bone Pain Tablets", which is effective.</p>

<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road (Consultation) 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Closed on Sundays.</p>
<p>(1) Nocturnal Emission and Smoking Addiction are Both Cured</p>
<p>The patient is Mr. Shen Jieming, 38 years old, from Fenghua, Zhejiang, and is a businessman. When Mr. Shen was a child, he was seduced by bad friends and mistakenly developed the bad habit of masturbation. He practiced it for a long time and became addicted to it. He frequently injured himself, causing considerable damage. As a result, his body was weak, and he suffered from symptoms such as dizziness, headache, mental fatigue, insomnia, and forgetfulness. He began to realize the severity of the harm and painfully quit, but he had already developed symptoms of kidney deficiency, lower back pain, nocturnal emission, and spermatorrhea. At first, he only had nocturnal emission with dreams, a few times a month; then, he had nocturnal emission without dreams, many times every ten days. He was exhausted and could hardly support his physical strength. Although he had taken many tonics, they were not effective and he was not cured. Later, he smoked to relieve it at a friend's place, and became addicted. Recently, the government has strictly ordered smoking cessation, but because the withdrawal is very painful, it is difficult to succeed completely. Then, he was introduced to me by his close friend, Mr. Tao Jingshan, for diagnosis and treatment. I used "Himito's Semen Consolidating Pills" to strengthen his vas deferens, and instructed him to take "Germinal Essence" to replenish the deficiency and eliminate the addiction and toxins. At the same time, I injected him with "Yuwei Cibaoming" to reduce the pain of withdrawal. Using this thorough and permanent treatment method, in less than two months, Mr. Shen's complexion was ruddy, and the nocturnal emission was completely cured. At the same time, the smoking addiction was safely quit, and his weight gradually increased.</p>
<p>(2) Childhood Marriage, Impotence, and Sexual Weakness</p>
<p>The patient is Mr. Feng Shuliang, only 19 years old, who lives in Pudong and is engaged in farming. Mr. Feng suffered from premature marriage, and the other party was a mature older woman, three years older than Feng. This kind of marriage was purely the order of the parents and the words of the matchmaker. One year after marriage, he suffered from premature ejaculation. When he was 18 years old, due to excessive sexual activity, his physical weakness became more severe, and he even suffered from impotence. At the same time, his muscles were thin, his spirit was weak, and he sometimes felt tinnitus, dizziness, and reduced hearing. Symptoms such as forgetfulness and insomnia broke out one after another. Therefore, after three years of marriage, he still has no children. His parents, seeing this situation, began to panic and sought good doctors everywhere, but with little effect. It was not until this spring that he came to me for diagnosis and treatment through the introduction of his uncle. In addition to using the latest electrotherapy, I also prescribed "Germinal Essence", which is the most nourishing to the reproductive glands. In this way, his spirit was twice as strong as before, his muscles were also rich in blood, and his weight increased by about twelve pounds. Mr. Feng became more convinced, and at the same time, he absolutely prohibited sexual intercourse for about two months. Symptoms such as premature ejaculation and impotence disappeared completely, and his whole body regained development.</p>

<p>Talks</p>
<h3>Talking About the Inheritance Tax Issue</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>Yesterday, I wrote an article about Chen Jitang crying, which led to the recent government's plan to actively plan to collect the inheritance tax. Mr. Chen is a good example of a deeply poisonous inheritance. Inheriting property is an unearned right, but in modern social and economic theory, it should be taxed. Therefore, advanced countries not only attach importance to inheritance tax, but also regard inheritance tax as one of the country's important tax sources. According to economists, inheritance tax has the function of controlling capital, developing social production, and eliminating national dependence and promoting self-reliance. This is the result of economists' theoretical research, and their statement is naturally correct.</p>
<p>But I think this is not a fundamental solution. The fundamental solution is to simply abolish the inheritance system. Therefore, collecting inheritance tax not only has various troubles, but also has many drawbacks. There is no accurate investigation of national property in our country, and there is no regulation for registering inherited property with the government. Moreover, inheriting property is an old system inherited from thousands of years ago in our country. Once inheritance tax is collected, the national economy will inevitably store more money in foreign banks to avoid national collection, or use the names of other people's property to circumvent it. Secondly, inheritance tax only collects a part of it, and there is still a large part of it as inheritance, so descendants can still enjoy wealth and honor, and live a luxurious life. The grandfather should accumulate more wealth. The more wealth accumulated, the more the tax collection can make descendants enjoy endlessly.</p>
<p>I don't understand economics, and I don't understand the principles of economic operation. However, according to the current economic situation in our country, saying that collecting inheritance tax has the function of controlling capital and developing social production, I dare not say, and saying that it can eliminate national dependence and promote self-reliance is even more difficult to say. Therefore, I say that collecting inheritance tax can increase the country's economic income by a large part, but saying that it can control capital and develop production is just a tax term. Because the capital of our country, according to the current situation, should be increased as soon as possible, let alone control it, and the development of production should also depend on the method and purpose of production.</p>
<p>Therefore, my proposition is not to oppose the collection of inheritance tax, but to go further and simply abolish the inheritance system. Human beings are originally selfish animals. Seeing Chen Jitang's recent affairs and the situation of society, most of them are the result of the inheritance system. It is really necessary to abolish the inheritance system. The so-called inheritance is to leave it to the children and grandchildren, and to the great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren, and to the infinite grandchildren. Therefore, the more wealth accumulated, the wider and farther the inheritance left. Therefore, unscrupulous exploitation and demand, and harsh collection, the more harmful and the more numerous. If the inheritance system is abolished, then we will know the uselessness of accumulating capital and the uselessness of collecting money, which is enough to reduce the greedy desires for taking and demanding. Not only will the economic concept be slightly less valued, but also the idea of harming others and benefiting oneself can not arise, that is, public undertakings and social production can also be developed because of this. If the country's income is more and more, and there are fewer and fewer social wealthy slaves, isn't this a win-win situation?</p>
<h3>Breaking Ground</h3>
<p>— Zhifu</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>At dawn, the people at the foot of Eagle Claw Mountain woke up, like wild birds, crawling out of the low thatched huts one by one.</p>
<p>They were always paying attention to the road construction project. Recently, the Liu supervisor had come to the foot of the mountain and said to the people:</p>
<p>"... We braved the hot weather to measure the wasteland, lay a monument, delineate the boundaries, and mark the lines... Now the work can be considered complete. On the half of June, we will start breaking ground. The procedures for assigning labor and compiling schedules can be announced immediately! This section of Eagle Claw Mountain is assigned to the two supervisors, Lao Liu and Guo Ma's Face..."</p>
<p>His words were exciting. The people at the foot of the entire mountain stared at each other, waiting for - the half of June - the auspicious day for breaking ground.</p>
<p>On the eve of this near date, they sharpened those iron shovels, hoes, and digging tools to a shine. The entire valley was filled with the clanging sound of metal.</p>
<p>Everyone's desire grew stronger -</p>
<p>"When the work is completed, we will enjoy ourselves! We will communicate with the outside world, we will be... we..."</p>
<p>"But, when can it be completed? Dad..."</p>
<p>"Soon!..."</p>
<p>The resident living in the hillside slope, the old farmer Weng Ahu, who was born like a yellow wolf with a head full of white hair, felt a more joyful thirst than others. His son, Xiao Atu, smiled with a thin black face, playing with the iron digging and questioning him.</p>
<p>Although they could not understand everything clearly, a kind of strange expectation filled the minds of the father and son...</p>
<p>A very comfortable early wind blew, and the bright red small flag inserted on the top of the mountain fluttered, almost shaking people's eyes in a chaotic manner.</p>
<p>Paying attention to the vicinity of the red flag, you can also find the white, sheep intestine-like powder road. Guo Ma's Face and others had been doing these jobs on the mountain a few days earlier.</p>
<p>People will use these lines to flatten it with hoes and sweaty blood...</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>An unprecedentedly excited commotion of the people of Eagle Claw Mountain unfolded at noon that day.</p>
<p>Supervisor Liu, Lao Guo Ma's Face, and a group of about ten people, wearing straw hats, arrived at the foot of the mountain when the sun climbed over the roof ridge.</p>
<p>Wearing two iron carts of tools, full of bamboo baskets, mud baskets, carrying poles, bronze stoves...</p>
<p>"Folks! Breaking ground today..."</p>
<p>"We gather at the mining area at the foot of the West Mountain... Brothers!"</p>
<p>Sharp voices shouted at the same time:</p>
<p>"Supervisor Liu! Which section are we assigned to work?"</p>
<p>"Wu Li Gang..."</p>
<p>"Start cultivating the land!"</p>
<p>"Breaking ground... first chop down trees..."</p>
<p>"Oh!..."</p>
<p>So, people returned to the doors of the thatched huts, carrying hoes on their shoulders, and walked excitedly towards the foot of the mountain...</p>
<p>In the vast open space, people gathered one after another, like ants. The air became tense! The widespread human voice spread from the noisy foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>Everyone in the village was so crazy that they almost danced with joy.</p>
<p>The surroundings became quiet as if they had been acupuncture, and even the towering Eagle Claw Mountain was as quiet as a kind old man, piously praying for their expectations!</p>
<p>One Foundation Hard After measuring and delineating the boundaries, a stone tablet with gold characters is erected. This procedure is commonly called - laying a foundation.</p>
<p>Two Color Line Use lime to wipe a white boundary line on the boundary line of the road construction.</p>
<p>Three Breaking Ground This is a common custom. Before starting work, a "breaking ground" practice must be performed, similar to the current popular - ribbon-cutting ceremony, unveiling ceremony... similar customs.</p>
<h3>If the Young Masters Return to the Countryside</h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<h3>Our Country's Beekeeping and Rabbit Raising Industry (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>(Special Report from This Newspaper) Our country is very suitable for beekeeping, both in terms of geography and climate; and beekeeping is not only easy to manage, but also does not require a lot of capital. As long as the area is rich in nectar sources, with a few hundred dollars of capital and five acres of land, a beekeeping field can be opened.</p>
<p>Beekeeping is a good rural sideline, its profitability is excellent, and it is also very helpful for flowers and fruits; European and American countries not only vigorously promote beekeeping, but also equip bee colonies near every orchard to increase fruit production. However, the general farmers in our country lack common sense and think that bees are harmful to fruit trees; although some people raise one or two colonies of bees, they only keep them for fun and do not know how to manage them. As a result, they all escape and die.</p>
<p>The first person in our country to advocate improved beekeeping was Mr. Hua Yizhi. In the first year of the Republic of China, he raised Italian bees in Xinzhi Dangkou Town using new methods. Up to now, the number of bee breeds promoted in the Yangtze River and South China areas is no less than 30,000 to 40,000 boxes, and the establishment of beekeeping fields in various places is almost like bamboo shoots after a rain. Those who have achieved results include Lida, Qingchun, Dazhong, Hua Yizhi, Xiaonong, Gan Yongmao, and other beekeeping fields, namely the Zhonghua Bee Breed Improvement Field. They all have a relatively long history in the beekeeping industry.</p>
<p>Among the bee breeds, the Italian bee is the best. There are currently about 4 million boxes of this bee colony raised in the United States; our country has a vast territory, abundant flowers and plants, and if we can promote breeding, it is not difficult to exceed this number.</p>
<p>The average annual honey production per box is about 50 catties, and the average value of every 100 catties is about 20 to 30 yuan.</p>
<p>Honey has a wide range of functions. In addition to being used in Chinese and Western medicines, cosmetics, candies, tea cakes, and cakes, it can also replace sugar, and can be used to make honey wine - Mr. Jiang Hongze of Lida School sells real honey wine, which is made using his own invented "honey wine making method" (now available for sale at Lida Farm). It can be used to make honey tea. In German villages, honey tea is served to guests. - It can be used to make tonics, and it is better to mix it with milk to feed children. Honey is a semi-digested product, so it will not cause diabetes, and it will absorb moisture and has the effect of relieving cough.</p>
<p>Second-grade honey is also good for making machine oil, which will not solidify in cold weather. It can also be used to make shoe polish. Loquat, lychee, longan, and orange honey have a very clear, fragrant, and sweet taste, and can be made into honey tea to replace coffee and tea.</p>
<p>In addition to the many functions of honey, beeswax also has many uses. For example, chemicals and medicines also need beeswax. It is also said that the value of pure beeswax is also very expensive.</p>
<p>The distribution of honey sources in various parts of our country is very wide; like Guangdong and Fujian, there are oranges, lychees, longans, yellow peels, rapeseed and other flowers for collection. Yunnan has gallyl, Jiangsu and Zhejiang have rapeseed, purple cloud, black cypress, wormwood, orange, orange, tea, etc. Sichuan has rapeseed, oranges, wild flowers, and the north has locusts, jujubes, etc.</p>
<p>In the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, it is also suitable for mobile transfer breeding, which can be transported by civil ships or trains; rapeseed and purple cloud are collected in spring, black cypress is collected in summer, wormwood is collected in autumn, and loquat and camellia are collected in winter.</p>
<p>However, the beekeeping industry in our country is still very young; and it is only like scattered sand with no unity and no organization. If everyone can unite and organize a honey sales cooperative, then not only will the honey outlet be large, but the number of bee colonies raised will also increase. I hope that those who care about rural side businesses will pay attention to this.</p>

Suddenly, Jiang Xue smiles, opening her mouth slightly. She says we, appreciating snow like this, is too boring. Today, let's try to search and collect fruits of knowledge about snow. Let's compare, whose mind holds the highest snow classics. Having said that, her snow-white face contains a happy expression. And that, the beautiful Yan Xue is also delighted in her heart.

<p>Opening Verse "New Baoyu Visiting the Sick"</p>
<p>Master Yi Hong and Cui Qing. They were childhood sweethearts with affection for each other. Unexpectedly, Heaven envies their happiness. The beautiful woman is confined to her sorrowful city due to illness. Her delicate body lies in the Xiaoxiang Pavilion. Her little maid often brews tea with medicine. Sighing that there are few people who understand her heart. Filled with emotions, tears well up in her eyes. Suddenly, she hears the sound of a parrot calling. Saying a guest is knocking at the door, calling the maid Juan by name. She quickly orders the maid outside to go to the door. To ask who has come and wants to be heard clearly. That maid obeys the order and opens the door. Seeing that it is Baoyu who has come, she feels touched. Because he has come at night, which is a rare event. It shows that he is, affectionate and righteous, truly accomplished. How can she not connect the lights, then guide his footsteps into the door. Reaching the bedside, she announces. Saying Master Baoyu is walking alone tonight. He personally came to visit her. She says that she welcomes him with a sincere heart on behalf of her mistress. He has already come to your bedside to see you. You can ask him to judge whatever you feel is right. Daiyu hears. A myriad of emotions rise within her. Like seeing the sun after a long rain. She has a thousand words to say but doesn't know where to begin. Forcing herself to gently call out "Cousin." Saying the second sister-in-law is too deceitful. I am melancholic and sickly, and I am about to die of anger. Although the Old Ancestor treats me kindly. It is difficult for me to express my grievances when I am sick. Don't expect me to recover quickly. I'm afraid we'll have to make our vows in the next life. Baoyu hears. His heart is startled. He advises her not to expect Wang's family to bring her good fortune. After giving advice, he bids farewell. It is difficult to make unfair grievances. He can only, sing these opening verses.</p>

<p>Yuanchang (1120) 12:45 AM to 1:30 AM</p>
<p>Opening Verse "Proverb Song" (Founding Issue of Mimi Collection)</p>
<p>Strange and bizarre, new jokes. Nonsensical talk to deceive you all. A world of dazzling tricks and changes. Groaning and sighing about suffering. Confused and muddled, truly carefree. Dazed and bewildered, blindly enthusiastic. Big shots with bad consciences. Pretending to be foolish, bullying people. Wine, sex, wealth, and temper. Welcomed by thieves and thugs. Abundant family wealth with high profits. Wealthy and powerful people should not be. Grievances soaring to the sky, the poor suffer. How can they freely make a living. Who pities the short man eating farts? The vicious and evil are fighting for power. Most ridiculous, the young girls sell their charm. Dazzling eyes, laughing is inappropriate. Pressing down the head and scattering the hair, imitating the trendy style. Pushing out the chest and bulging the belly, dressing up anew. Red lips and white teeth, catching eyes. Pity her small feet make it difficult to walk. Oily, dripping, smooth hair. Delicate white skin, all worth swallowing. A ball of harmony, a short, fat man. Just like the Earth Godmother, a former incarnation. Jige Luo Duo is skilled. Pulling strings and hooking up, talking about love. Clashing cymbals and clapping benches, gambling with coins. Shouting and yelling, noisy and crowded. Sore hands and aching feet, truly suffering. Shaking heads and wagging tails, what is the point. Later, when the transplant fails and the framework collapses. Scolding the daughter-in-law while blaming the mother, causing embarrassment. Zhang San and Li Si, utter nonsense. Wine and meat friends, lack of mediation. Sharp-headed tricksters want to freeload. The five ghosts and seven fiends scold the temple gate. I advise you all to live your lives properly and orderly.</p>

<h3>Sea Swallow Theatre Company Continues to Recruit Actors</h3>
<p>The Sea Swallow Theatre Company, due to the staging of Gorky's "Burui Cao Fu," publicly recruited male and female actors a few days ago. In the middle, it was intended to participate in the 5th Anniversary performance of the Shanghai West Gan Gong Elementary School Alumni Association, such as "Father, Son, and Brothers," which caused a delay. It is estimated that there are seven qualified people, including Sun Yimei and Changsun Buwei, and rehearsals will begin soon. However, the play requires a large number of female actors, so from the 5th to the 10th, four more female actors will be continuously recruited. Anyone who loves acting, please come to the company at 7 Huatong Lane, Beixizang Road Bridge from 2:00 PM every day for an interview.</p>

<h3>The Prelude to Red Begonia</h3>
<p>On the stage, female Pingju Opera singer, Red Begonia (played by Bai Yuqin), is performing her masterpiece "Du Shiniang," and the audience applauds.</p>
<p>In the box, the Chief Secretary of the Military Governor's Office (played by Wang Jiting) stares at Red Begonia with his sharp eyes. He secretly thinks that such a female singer with both beauty and talent is most suitable for the Military Governor's (played by Tan Deyuan) order to him to find beauties for the Military Governor every day. Red Begonia naturally cannot escape the power of the Military Governor and is called to the Military Governor's Office to accompany the Military Governor in drinking and having fun.</p>
<p>Red Begonia's husband (played by Wang Xianfu) is a person who is walking on the wrong path. He only knows how to gamble for fun every day and does not engage in production. The burden of the family's livelihood must be shouldered by his wife, and the gambling money must also be supplied by his wife. When his desires cannot be satisfied, he uses tyrannical means to deal with her. Because it is an era of feudal society, she pitifully suffers from the shackles of feudalism and has nowhere to groan, so she can only submit. Her only hope is her son. She places her life on her son and is determined to use her strength to make her son a worthy person in the future society, so that her son can be a dignified person in the future society. However, under the pressure of gambling debts from all directions, her husband stole the savings that his father had left for his coffin for his entire life, and even secretly sold his son in the middle of the night. This is not a deep wound being cut in her heart. She frantically shouts, "It's over! My son is gone! I'm also done! Everything is over!"</p>
<p>Yes, her son is her life. Her son is gone, how can she not be sad and crazy!</p>
<p>The Military Governor thought of Red Begonia, who failed to satisfy him the last time, and sent the Chief Secretary to forcibly call her to him. At this time, she had the idea of dying. During the banquet, she used flowery words to make the Military Governor drunk. Suddenly, she drew a white blade and stabbed it at the Military Governor's chest. However, the Military Governor was not stabbed, and she was arrested by the guards and押送 to prison.</p>
<p>The arrival of the revolutionary army released her from prison, but she had nowhere to return. She wandered on the vast land. During a long and arduous journey, she found her son who had been sold ten years ago. A trace of a smile appeared on her haggard and bloodless face.</p>

<h3>Active American Truck Market</h3>
<p>— Moore</p>
<p>The American truck market has been very active recently. All commercial vehicle and truck manufacturers are showing bright prospects. It is a rare good phenomenon in recent years. Taking the domestic retail market in the United States as an example, in the first half of 1936, 300,000 trucks have been sold. In 1929, there were only 263,192. Therefore, people in the truck industry expect that the number of trucks sold this year may reach 600,000. Everyone is optimistic about achieving this goal.</p>
<p>Recently, the truck business has been developing rapidly. Although the weather in January was very cold, sales were 43,000 vehicles. The number of deliveries in February reached 40,000 vehicles. From February onwards, the sales curve gradually rose. By April, its record broke recent simultaneous records. The number of trucks sold reached 65,000, and the total sales in May were 60,000. In addition to the good phenomena in the domestic market, the number of trucks purchased by government agencies and various departments is also very large. Moreover, the number of exports is not included. Truck sales have shown a balanced development throughout the year. Almost every month of the year, all aspects are in urgent need of shares. The signs are very stable. Its signs are exactly the same as those hoped for by passenger car manufacturers. In the first six months of 1935, 50% of the truck industry was completed during this period. The business in the second half of the year did not exceed the first half. In 1934, 52% of the truck business was completed in the second six months. In a word, the truck industry has reached a very gratifying point. That is, buyers have changed their purchasing attitudes due to seasonal factors.</p>
<p>Most of the American truck industry this year comes from rural areas. The percentage is greater than any other aspect. American farmers own 26% of the total number of trucks in the country. In the worst days of the depression, they purchased only 8%. According to the estimates of the two major companies in this industry this year, the number of trucks purchased by rural areas can reach 30% of the total sales.</p>
<p>Because orders for trucks are increasing day by day, the assembly work of each car factory has also been restored accordingly. The stimulus in this regard is of course partly due to direct and indirect government funding. The number of trucks purchased by transportation companies is quite large. Especially in the companies that combine tractors and trailers. The number of new additions to large-scale motorcades is even greater. Several department stores are planning a new type of truck. Its load capacity is much greater than the now common trucks. Its capacity per square foot has increased a lot. Moreover, loading and unloading are much easier than before. The market sales of this type of car are obviously very broad. Because they have extraordinary advantages in daily use. Small businessmen, especially many shops in the suburbs, order the most of this type of car.</p>
<p>Various companies have implemented a 6% subsidy plan for customers who purchase trucks and passenger cars. This has indeed increased business a lot. The sales of large trucks are still continuing to increase. However, in order to reduce the taxes paid, small trucks sell better than large trucks. This year, because of the heavy licensing fees for one-and-a-half-ton vehicles, half-ton small vehicles are likely to rise and replace them. Recently, various car companies, in view of the popularity of small cars, have produced three-quarter-ton cars for the market. The "cab on the engine" type of truck has seen a large increase in sales due to its increased loading capacity, length not exceeding regulations, and increased operational efficiency. This phenomenon is not only the case for heavy-duty vehicles, but also for towing tractors and other vehicles.</p>
<p>Truck manufacturers have not ignored the appeal of streamlining. It is true that streamlining is attracting attention. However, the only element of a truck is its purpose. It must be consistent inside and out to complement each other. The trucks used by oil companies to transport oil products are all streamlined. When they are transported from the distribution station to the service station of the distributors, they swagger through the streets, which is also an excellent advertisement. Diesel engine vehicles will be popular in the future. However, they cannot compete in the market now. At present, a retail customer can buy a truck that runs entirely on gasoline for less money. If it is a diesel engine, the price will be much higher. The chassis, body, and other aspects are not included. However, at present, various well-known truck manufacturers are working hard to develop a good diesel engine vehicle. They must achieve the advantages of economy and ease of use. However, the selling price must be low in order to popularize it.</p>
<h3>A Bunch of Automobile Briefs</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>General Motors adds factory buildings The American General Motors Corporation has decided to build an eleven-story building to expand its research and experiment plant in Detroit. The cost is US$1,000,000. It is reported that this project has already begun. According to General Motors Vice President Knudson, this huge building is being built next to the existing factory building. The purpose of its construction is to implement General Motors' expansion plan. The lower seven floors of the new factory building will be occupied by the mechanical tool design department of the Fisher Body Plant. The upper four floors will be used by the General Motors Beauty Department. After the Fisher plant moves out of the main building, the empty building at its original site will be moved into by the Chevrolet Machinery Department. It is said that this new building will be completed in the fall of this year.</p>
<p>Sales of all vehicles have increased (1) In the first ten days of June this year, Studebaker's retail sales in the United States were 2,293 vehicles.

<p>The Pagoda car factory plans to expand The Pagoda car factory is now working hard to expand. According to the factory's general manager, Mr. Klingiu, new machines have already been installed in the axle factory. This is the largest part of the entire 6,000,000 yuan expansion plan. In a few months, the newly installed machines will be able to be used. At that time, 850 workers will be added to adapt to the realization of the expansion plan.</p>
<p>Trucks make the most noise The Noise Reduction Committee of the 1st Avenue Association in New York is recently studying the sources of various noises on the road and trying to reduce them. According to the results of the research by the committee chairman, Mr. Price, the noises made by trucks are the loudest. The report given by the committee to its members is as follows: The air freight trucks of the Department of Health travel on the granite-paved road on First Avenue. The noise they make is the loudest and most annoying. The Committee has discussed prevention methods with Automobile Commissioner Hanai Tuomin. It is proposed to prohibit trucks from using solid tire wheels and chain drives for a period of two years.</p>
<p>Average towage of 110 miles The average towage mileage of American commercial trucks is 110 miles, according to a report by the Truck Committee of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association. According to the committee's report, this number was obtained from an investigation by the Federal Transportation Standards Council. The cargoes carried by trucks range from short-distance loads of sand and soil, etc., of 15 miles to long distances of 350 miles. The cargoes transported over long distances are mostly fresh fruits and vegetables that cannot be stored for a long time, which are more valuable and lighter in weight.</p>
<h3>New Overseas Car Race News (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Four-Cylinder Cars Again Dominate</p>
<p>May 30th is American Memorial Day. The Indianapolis auto race was held on this day. The champion was Mr. Mayhew from California. He drove a four-cylinder car. The average speed per hour was 109.069 miles. Mayhew is a three-time winning race car driver. This time, he broke his previous personal record with a four-cylinder car, which is also noteworthy. He had previously participated in the race with a compound cylinder car. In 1930, he drove a sixteen-cylinder car and finished fourth with a speed of 95.253 miles per hour. Among the cars participating this time, seven of the top ten were four-cylinder cars, three were eight-cylinder cars, and none were six-cylinder cars. Since 1911, ten victories have belonged to four-cylinder cars, and in 1934, 1935, and 1936, four-cylinder cars won the championship for three consecutive years. The entire Indianapolis race is 500 miles. The gasoline limit is 37 and a half gallons per car. When Mayhew finished the race, there were still three and a half gallons of gasoline left in the tank. On average, each gallon of gasoline can travel fifteen miles. Ten cars participating in the race were forced to withdraw before the finish line due to running out of gas. David Whalest, the general manager of the Whalest Wo Fuland Company, regarding the success of four-cylinder cars in the Indianapolis race, said that Mayhew's record proves that the speed and fuel economy of four-cylinder cars are undoubtedly achievable. According to Whalest, the car factory has 28 years of experience in manufacturing four-cylinder cars. Whalest also said that when Whalest cars can travel 35 miles per gallon of gasoline, the fuel consumption of other cars will be like Mayhew's car traveling a hundred miles per hour. In addition to fuel economy, the characteristics of four-cylinder cars also include excellent durability, as required in the 500-mile Indianapolis race. Therefore, it is said that the Whalest Company will continue to manufacture four-cylinder cars based on its 38 years of manufacturing experience.</p>
<p>New Seven-Mile Racetrack</p>
<p>The British are currently building a seven-mile auto racing track near Kirk City. If this plan can be realized according to budget, the highest speed auto races will be held on this new racetrack during the International Auto Race Festival. This planned racetrack includes a three-mile-long famous track between Kirk and Garri Lohan. British machine-powered cyclist, Mr. La Aite, set a world speed record of over 150 miles per hour several years ago. London racer, Fan Shousidun Haofu, recently drove a car in the Kirk Race. Afterwards, he said that he would like to hold a car race there in the next session. Fan said that this and an ideal track, the speed per hour should be between ninety and one hundred miles. Recently, several Irish auto racers also went to the site for inspection. The citizens of Kirk and auto racing enthusiasts all hope that the racetrack can be completed as scheduled. Mayor Frank has been elected as the chairman of the design committee. It is expected that this racetrack will be used for public competitions, with a prize of one thousand pounds. In the future, there will be no shortage of auto racers from Europe and Britain participating.</p>
<h3>Harvard University Experiment: The Issue of Men and Women Driving Cars</h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>Proof that Men are Superior to Women</p>
<p>Regarding men and women driving cars, some people say that women are more careful than men, so their skills are particularly excellent and it is more difficult to cause accidents, and their driving skills are improving. Both sides hold their own opinions, and it is difficult to reach a consensus. But this time, Dr. Xueerhua of the Transportation Problem Research Association of Harvard University in the United States has conducted a practical test on men and women driving cars from the perspective of gender psychology and technology. According to him, there are currently no ideal car drivers of any age. In fact, women's driving skills are generally not as good as men's. At the same time, the research association also acknowledges that there are many reasons in humans themselves that can cause car accidents, and the only way to reduce such accidents is to start from education.</p>
<p>Dr. Xueerhua told us that women's physical skills and psychological inspiration in driving cars are not as good as men's, and they are not as easy to teach as men. Although it is very convenient to teach women over 20 years old to drive a car, it may be difficult for those between 25 and 30 years old to learn. As for men, among people of different ages, people around 23 years old are the most agile in encountering danger and traffic jams. Such people can immediately stop the vehicle in 41/100 of a second when they suddenly see danger ahead. In other words, at a speed of one mile per minute, he can stop the car at a distance of 35 feet. The action of stopping the car will gradually slow down with age for people over 23 years old. On the other hand, it is also known that children aged 15 to 16 have very slow stopping actions, similar to those aged 35 to 40. Harvard University's road experts are not limited to ordinary car roads in this experiment on the advantages and disadvantages of men and women driving cars. Because at the beginning of the experiment, drivers rarely encountered danger after driving for a long time on city roads. Therefore, Dr. Xueerhua adopted various experimental tools and placed them on the road to make drivers immediately encounter various simulated dangers. The most important experiment is to enable the driver to simultaneously handle the steering wheel, stop the car, distributor, and accelerator in a split second. With this skill, a driver will not encounter any danger on the road when driving out.</p>
<p>This experiment on stopping the car also paid special attention to proving the effectiveness of the fastest method in a few tenths of a second. From stepping on the accelerator to discovering the red light and immediately stopping the car. Unexpectedly, it is said that the experimental results show that a person who has drunk a small amount of alcohol is more agile in stopping the car than an ordinary person. This is certainly unexpected to us. Although other skills will decline after drinking alcohol, only stopping the car is improved. Among 4,000 drivers, the average stopping time was 41/100 of a second. At a speed of 60 miles per hour, ordinary drivers can stop the vehicle within 40 feet. The highest stopping record was 24/100 of a second. In fact, most people usually react more slowly when stopping the car, but it is particularly fast because of the experimental nature. In the end, the agility of stopping the car depends half on experience and half on talent.</p>
<p>Regarding women driving cars, there were also many who participated in this test. According to Dr. Xueerhua, women lack regularity when driving cars compared to men. However, the longer women drive, the more opportunities they have to improve, while men are like that from beginning to end, and there is no progress in the middle. The period of progress in men's driving skills lasts as long as ten years. From then on, it will decline. After about 25 years of experience, the driving skills of men and women can be said to be equal. If age and driving skills are matched, then those under 15 years old have very poor skills, and progress is fast after 15 years old, and even faster between 17 and 20 years old. It starts to decline from the age of 55. Facts tell us that after reaching this age, you should be extra careful when driving a car. As for this experiment, standard cars were used, and the roads passed were also very narrow.</p>
