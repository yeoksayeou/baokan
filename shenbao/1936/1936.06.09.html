<h3>中央决定　召開二中全會　商决現時應採步驟　蔣昨在中央紀念週　對時事重要報吿　兩廣準備單獨行動絕不可信　和戰問題必須由中央全體同志來决定　召開中央二次全體會議關係甚係甚為重要</h3>
<p>（南京）今日中央决定訂期召集第五屆之二中全會、以便討論各項政策、（八日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）五屆一中全會、係在去歲十二月一日舉行、迄今已及半載、聞中央將於最近期間、召集二中全會、基於五全大會所决定之政策、而商决現時所應採用之適當步驟、（八日中央社電）</p>
<p>（南京）蔣副主席八日晨在中央紀念週報吿、原詞如次、主席各位同志、剛纔聽到居先生報吿此次赴粵致祭胡先生並唁慰胡先生家屬的經過、大家心裏一定覺得很傷感、胡先生的逝世、實在是本黨失去一位領導者、本來兩粵與中央並沒有多少隔閡、中央數年以來、始終秉集中國力的方針苦心、以謀團結之增進、在胡先生逝世以後、中央認定格外要體胡先生救國的苦心、對於在兩廣各位同志的意見和政治主張、必須儘量的容納、也相信在兩廣的同志、必能夠體察胡先生的遺志、進一步的實現團結、以增加我們一致的力量、完成我們救國的志願、這是中央最近對於兩廣至誠的態度、不過胡先生剛剛逝世、大家心裏都非常哀痛、决沒有心情再來商量喪祭以外的別的問題、所以此次居先生和幾位同志赴粵的時候、中央就决定單純為弔祭及唁慰家屬而往、並商量胡先生國葬的辦法、在胡先生喪事未辦理完妥以前、不談黨務上與政治上的許多事情、這不但中情理上應如此、在我們中國的禮儀精神上來說、喪禮祭禮必須至誠專一、盡哀盡敬、實在也不應該在胡先生新喪之際、大家正在辦理喪祭的時候、來談這些事、何况國難已到這般地步、以後只要可以團結救國、大家一切的意見、無不可以化除、任何事情、都可以開誠商討、擇善而從、也不必急於求得解决、所以此次中央推派八位委員到粵致祭、公私宴會一槪謝絕、更沒有商談黨政問題、不料外面猜測紛紛、竟有什麽中央向兩廣提出五項條件等等謠言、這種謠言、全無根據、說這種話或是聽信這種話的人、根本就沒有常識、我還可以斷定這種話完全不是中國人所說、只有不明中國的人情歷史和中國民族的禮敎精神的外國人　會隨便造這種謠言、來作挑撥離間的材料、最近一週以來、各方面的謠言格外多、尤其是日本同盟社所發的消息格外離奇、說兩廣要單獨抗日救國、組織軍政府、出兵北上、並且現在已經出兵到了鄰省的某某地方、而其他外國的新報電訊社也輾轉傳播、不一其詞、甚至還有推測兩廣出兵、不過是假抗日的名義、事實上是聯日、其目的在推翻中央、諸如此類的謠言、很多很多、現在兩廣的情形、究竟是怎樣、我們還不十分明瞭、但我們相信中央和兩廣救國的精神是一致的、兩廣同志對於救國必先團結、以及分歧不能救國的認識、必與中央的看法相同的、不　外字報紙種種誣蔑他們的話、我們决不能輕信、就是說他們已準備單獨出動、我們根據常理來判斷、也認為絕不可信、無論那一個國家、在决定對外關係的時候、其步驟必然是舉國一致的、其行動必須是整個的、只能聽一個中央政府命令、尤其和戰的問題、是關係整個國家民族生死存亡的大事、必須由中央斟酌實際的情形來决定、而且要中央全體同志來决定、决不是那一個地方政府或那幾個軍人單獨主張、就可以單獨出動、這樣不但不是為國家謀福利、而且還會喪失國家的人格、减少國家的力量、以加重國難的程度、兩廣的同志、同是中華民國的國民、而且都是本黨很有歷史的黨員、一定不會如此、所以我們對於最近的種種謠言、都一槪置之不信、自從去年五全大會以後、中央的外交方針、已經明白决定、宣示全國、中央這半年以來、一切外交內政、完全是遵照五全大會的决議案來做、决議案最主要的話、就是「和平未到完全絕望時期、决不放棄和平、犧牲未到最後關頭、亦决不輕言犧牲、」現在外交的情形、究竟已到了什麽階段、是不是和平已經絕望、國家已至非放棄和平不可的情勢、究竟應該採取何種方法來應付當前的事勢、這些問題、决不是一兩個人可以隨便判斷的、更不是少數人憑主觀的見解所能輕易决定的、一個國家根本大計的决定、絕不是倉卒草率的事、不但我們任何個人、不敢將國家民族生死存亡的大事、隨便决定、就是中央常會所有負責的同志、也不敢隨便來斷定、所以我們根據常識來推理、兩廣方面此時表示迫切的意見則有之、若說已經有如何行動、我認為多不可信、以上是說明外間謠諑紛紜、都不可信的理由、在中央所正式接到的、祗有從兩廣發出的兩個電報、中央對於他們的意見、當然很重視、本來我們中央全體會議、照規定每半年應該舉行一次、國家一切施政方針及實施情况、都應該在全會中有報吿和討論、現在中央同人準備就在常會提議召開中央第二次全體會議、使大家對現在國家的情勢、加一番精祥的審察、對政府半年來的設施、有一番切實的考查、對以後的方針、有一個决定和指示、在此國難嚴重的時期、這個會議關係國家前途甚為重要、兩廣一般同志關心國家安危、異常殷切、一定能踴躍參加、共决大計、總之、我相信兩廣决不會脫離中央、單獨對外、亦决不會假外交之名義、作內爭之口實、在這個艱難困苦的時期、每一個有良心的國民怎樣想、我相信兩廣的同志一定也怎樣想、現在謠諑紛紜、兄弟可以吿訴大家、並吿訴一般國民的、我們革命的過程中、也不知經過多少次內外夾攻中的苦鬥、現在一般國民對於革命救國的認識、日趨於普遍一致、我們革命的基礎、已經穩固、中央無論如何、必能秉一貫的信心和方針、提摯全國國民、來保障民族的生存、只要全國人民對國家當前情勢有正確的認識、不為浮言與謠諑所惑、一心一德、堅定不移、必能解除國難、復興民族、這是兄弟今天要向各位同志報吿、並且可以安慰我們全國同胞的一點意思、（八日中央社電）</p>

<h3>如何取締外國通信社</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>際此國難已達最嚴重之階段外國通訊社肆意製造謠言之時新聞界積極不能發揮輿論之力量消極不能制止謠言之流行精神苦痛達於極點近者日本同盟社正式兼併電通社彼國之通訊組織已絕對統一彼國政府已能絕對控制而合併未及一週卽製造驚動世界之謠言謂粵桂當局對中央有特殊之舉動滬上之外國人報紙競事登載人心受擾金融動搖而事閱一日方知受日本通訊機關之欺騙日本通信社之惡意固堪深憾而本國報紙記載之過分受限制政府對於外國報紙及通訊社之過分放任亦此種不幸事件發生之主耍原因也</p>
<p>外國通訊社及外國報紙之所以有造謠能力吾國報紙讀者之所以能受其欺騙者非一朝一夕之故也自政府實施嚴格之新聞檢查以來關心國事者於中國報紙上恒不能得到詳盡之重要記載於是飲酖止渴求之於外人所辦之報章某種華字之外國報紙銷路激增非無因也一般讀者不了解各種新聞之來源如何不考慮報紙及通訊社之背景如何遇有驚人之消息爲本國報紙所無者卽信以爲眞而本國報紙知其爲而不登載在讀者看來疑爲政府檢查之結果於是虛者信以爲實而實者反疑而爲虛使本國報紙一向有記載之全部自由則讀者此種變態心理無從發生矣</p>
<p>其次在此非常之局面相當之新聞統制非不必要也然旣施統制必求其有效在現狀之下孔隙至多而政府對於外國之報紙及通信社過分優待日本通訊社恃其政府後援發電不受檢查一切越軌之行爲固無論矣卽路透哈瓦斯等社亦享受過度之自由無法使之就範除同盟社以外其他外國通訊社雖無惡意之造謠然每發一電每傳一信總以其本國利益爲前提以宣傳其國之政策及各種金融商業機關之信譽與中國利益有衝突之時必犧牲中國之利益雖受輕度之檢查尚呶呶不已外國之報紙更肆無忌憚日本爲最英美次之欲收新聞控制之實效此實最大間題也</p>
<p>近者曼支斯得禦報之駐北平記者丁柏烈君於本月出版之太平洋季刋發表一文頗以中國政府對外國通訊員電稿之檢查爲詬病然丁氏亦深信外國通訊社之主觀色彩濃厚並引日本之通訊社爲例而哈瓦斯海洋社塔斯及路透等官辦及半官辦之通訊社丁氏亦謂不免官塲之色彩而不能盡客觀記載事實之責任外國通訊社記者自供如此則政府施以較嚴格之控制决非過分之舉也</p>
<p>是故對本國報紙相對的予以較充分之記載自由對於外國通訊社及外國人所辦之報紙施以嚴格之檢查與控制實政府當今之急務也</p>

<h3>日人積極圖蒙陰謀　目的對蘇聯外蒙取大包圍</h3>
<p>日本帝國主義、自從實現其併吞滿洲的野心之後、便把目光釘在那廣漠無邊的西伯利亞大平原上、因為那裏是世界上未曾開闢的寶庫、擁有豐富的礦產、如煤鐵及煤油等等、國防上萬不可缺的資源、都應有盡有、先天不足的日本、只要能够佔領這塊地方、便可以克立獨霸東西亞的牢固不?的基礎了、不過日本的這種野心、可不能够跟滿洲事變一樣、只消一舉手之勞、便宜可稱心滿意地獲得成功、因為蘇聯自九一八以後、己經在這遠東邊境的廣大屬地內屯駐三十餘萬精銳的紅軍並積極强化各項軍事設備、準備迎頭痛擊侵略者、因此日本為達到它的目的、自不敢冒險從事、而必須在軍事佈置上作更進一步的準備、窺伺內蒙便宜是這種準備之一、他要想在察哈爾和綏遠兩省境內建立第二傀儡國、西進再取寗夏、對蘇聯及外蒙取大包圍之形勢、以期侵入外蒙、截斷西伯利亞鐵道、　擊赤塔、烏丁斯克、伊爾庫次克等地、日本窺伺內蒙的這種計劃、在併吞東北四省之後便開始了、</p>
<p>當時它把哲里水卓索圖昭烏達三盟、改為偽興安省、便是為後日進一步建立偽蒙古國的準備、他的活動方式有兩種、一方面是懷柔封建王君、別一方面則利用漢奸加以逼迫、府、四年來日人在百靈廟滂江張垣之活動、無不如是、而李守信卓世海等偽軍、則在察東橫行無忌、旦夕企圖奄二省的陰謀、現在我們可以指出日人及漢奸偽軍等等的一切陰謀及設施、以提醒國人的注意、第一是偽軍的活動、李守信和卓世海等偽軍、自從佔據察東沽源·寶昌·張北·商都·康保·化德·等六縣以後、便在張北設立了兩所陸軍學校、招募大批的蒙古靑年、加以訓練、同時又利用去冬蒙災嚴重的時候、大招兵丁、擴充實力、最近它們更和熱邊偽軍張海鵬部及零星股匪保持聯絡、决定向西作軍事行動了、在可能時並將向南侵犯歸綏、希望在察綏兩省之內完成其包圍外蒙及蘇聯的第一步工作、</p>
<p>第二日人為掩護偽軍進行計、己由關外派來航空隊一隊、共二十架、分駐張北滂江百靈廟各處、並且在那裏開闢了很大的飛行場、同時又在綏遠·包頭·寗夏各地設無綫電臺、互通聲息、第三則是在文化上的麻醉工作、現在日人在滂江百靈廟包頭等各重要地方、都設立有所謂親善協會、善鄰協會等團體、這種團體所幹的工作、表面上多是關於慈善方面的、如像義務施醫啦、救濟貧啦等等、而實際上則是一個宣傳機關、他們派有許多年靑的日人組織巡行醫療隊到各地去免費治病、順便大放其蒙古自治的謬論、同時又設立許多小學校、實行奴化敎育、從地理上說來整個的內蒙古是我國西北的屏障、現在日人這樣處心積慮來計劃掠奪這塊國防前哨的土地、進一步可作為進窺中原的根據、其嚴重性眞不下於華北、國人實在不應該忽視的啊、（華聯社）</p>

<p>南京前為江南重地、迭遭兵亂、民間產權契證、散失居多、雖經淸末民初數次補騐、但均非澈底整理、反致紛亂愈甚、綜計京市發現契照種類、有善後局·勸農局·督懇局·淸文局·宮產局·商埠局·營產處·警察廳·督軍署·倒市各局·及其他軍政機關執照·江寗府·上元縣·江寗縣·及縣財務財政局等機關印契典契、以及新契·騐契·官契·白契·騐單·勘單·字據·包約等、不下數十種、所載土地坐落·戶名·面積·四至、復異常簡略空泛、產權極難確定、往往地僅一塊、輾轉買賣、契據證件多至四五十張、大小長短寬窄形式旣不一律、又復契頭尾、彼此粘附、分裁續白、破碎支離、其間影射偽造、尤使難於辨認、土地登記之目的、在整理土地、市土地局為愼重產權起見、對於辦理手續、力求祥密、凡登記案件、應先由所有權人塡具聲請書、檢同契證聲請登記、經查對底圖、調查四隣使用狀况、復勘面積房屋、並測製審查用圖、種種手續後、方能開始審查、而審查時對於戶名·坐落·四至·面積·隣地情况·權利關係·及書據之眞偽·全缺·等項、在在均須加以嚴密之查核、倘發生疑義、復須調查·詢話·或使用其他方法、以期確知產權眞相、迨審查確定、始予公吿、俟三個月期滿、無聲明異議者、始予製定所有權圖狀、送法院會印後、通知具領、故每一登記案、經此繁重手續、平均需時六個月始能辦結、核准登記、倘登記進行期間、因聲請人及關係人無法傳訊、或因關係書據無法調騐、則登記進行、不免阻滯、倘產權發生訟爭、則必待法院判决、始能進行審查、登記更不免延擱、此為登記案件普通登記進行程序也、</p>
<p>登記費及罰則</p>
<p>京市辦理土地登記、徵收登記費、係依修正南京市土地登記暫行規則之規定、計聲請為第一次所有權登記、按照申報價或佔價收費千分之二、聲籠為土地權利之取得·設定·移轉·或變更之登記、依其賣價或權利價値收費千分之一、另書狀費依土地權利價値每張收費額如下、　不滿百元者二角、　百元以上者五角、　五百元以上者一元、　千元以上者二元、　五千元以上者五元、　萬元以上者十元、至登記罰則、則規定凡土地權利人或義務人、如逾登記期限請求登記者、每逾十五日遞加徵收登記費十分之四、又二十五年起舉辦假定登記、規定假定登記公吿後、呈准補行登記者、須照其登記產價加徵千分之五之罰金、上項登記費及逾限登記加徵之費、暨補行登記罰金、均由土地局經徵、逐日解繳市庫、查該局自二十四年七月起至二十五年四月底、共收登記費三萬八千三百八十八元零二分、登記逾限罰金九十五元六角八分、</p>
<p>組織及經費</p>

<h3>蘇州　蘇鄕農民又滋事</h3>
<p>蘇鄕車坊斜塘等鄕、連續發生農民鬧租事件、縣政府以各棧收租不旺、令縣統扯　有五成、而田賦收數、亦僅七成左右、故將於日內在斜塘鄕設立流動糧　、詎六日上午、斜塘鄕楊募石港等處、又了生農民集眾滋事、經保安隊馳往彈壓後、即行平熄、當時捕抗租鬧事之農民胡生元等二人、解送公安分局核辦、至七日上午八時許、對圩一帶、亦發現集中農民二百餘人、在枯廟中會議、意圖請願、亦經保安隊動散、是日下午二時許、蓮慕村等處、又有農民四百餘人、分乘農船十餘艘、前往謝婆圩働人保長趙步淸家內、將傢具物件搗毀、旋即散去、保安大隊長聶德昭據報前情、立即赴鄕、召集鄕民訓話、勸導一切、聞是晚金廟鄕亦有農民一百餘人、圖謀鬧租、因警隊防　嚴密、未敢有所舉動、官司廳對此、亦無根本解决之辦法、</p>
<h3>本夫砍傷野鴛鴦</h3>
<p>木　鄕謝巷村農民沈根世、其妻謝金英、不守婦道、與同村人張泉林有染、七日下午四時許、沈要世出外賣　返家、進門後、見其妻謝氏與張泉林同睡一床、於是憤　取得菜刀一柄、將謝氏頭部連砍數刀、姘夫張泉林亦被砍數刀、二人受傷後、同臥地不得動、事為鄰人聞悉、報由該管公安第五分局派警到來、將沈根世逮捕解往分局、一面將受傷人送院醫治、張泉林傷勢頗重、性命堪虞、己於八日由縣分局將沈根世解送公安局、轉送地檢處訊辦、聞沈根世在公安局供認因憤行兇不諱、沈謝氏亦供認與張泉林姘識等語、</p>
<h3>無錫　鮮繭收數暢旺</h3>
<p>本邑四鄕繭行、業己開秤、第三日收貨較第一日踴躍、因農民均急於應用、雖價格低廉、衹得相率出售、八日城區各繭行、因天雨關係、收數不旺、繭價看高三十五元、鄕區如后宅·隻闆橋·禮社·張村·陸典橋·夏家邊·黃土塘·吉郎浜·靑祁·閘橋·河埒口·石塘灣·北方泉·廓卜等處繭行、到貨甚踴、每行每日可收貨一二百擔、繭價為高三十七元、扯價每擔三十五元、惟一般經濟富裕之資戶、均將鮮繭烘焙　繭、尚待善價脫售</p>
<h3>工商業小額放欵</h3>
<p>江蘇銀行總行、以舉辦工商業小額放欵一案、為經呈奉蘇省府指令照准\　並　請江蘇高等法院、令行各縣縣政府、轉知各縣市鎭商會協助辦理、該行所設行處、除上海南京兩特別市外、其餘在本省各縣所設行處、計有（分行）鎭江·無錫·吳縣·南通·常熟·（支行）武進·銅山·泰縣·泰興·東海·淮陰·（辦事處）海門·啓東·靖江·江浦·江都·專郵·儀徵·淮安·蕭縣·碭山·泗陽等二十一處總行方面、為管理便利起見、擬即囑各分支行負責試辦、辦有成效、即逐漸推廣、並為愼重放欵計、特函請商會組織審查介紹工沒業小額放欵委員會、惟借欵數目、不得超過曙幣一千元、期限不得過四個月、如違約不償者、須受地方政府行政處分及法律處分、其未經加入同業公會之商號或　廠、槪不得申請借欵、</p>

<h3>常州　繭行開秤後市况</h3>
<p>武邑城鄕本年登記報開繭行共計八十七家、開秤日期、經繭公會大會議决、定於六月八日一律開秤、惟東南各鄕上簇較早、故東橫林·威墅堰·塘橋·坂上·縣家橋·陳渡橋·等鎭繭行、均提早於六月七日先後開秤收繭、改良種繭身甚佳、到貨雖不十分擁擠、但繭價己超出預定價格、市秤改良種看高每担三十五六元、土種價為二十五六元、西北各鄕　汎較　、亦於七日開始收繭、惟到貨甚稀、大約八日起、全縣繭行當為旺收時期、價自提高後、鄕民莫不喜形於色、</p>
<h3>揚州　廳令浚河工竣期</h3>
<p>江都縣府、因前奉建廳訓令、頒發本年度各縣征工浚河　易辦法、早經轉令各有浚關係之各區公所商辦在案、現年度將了、又續奉建廳訓令、著將己浚之河道、於本月底作一結束、其己浚未完者、統限於六月十五日、一律趕辦竣工、呈廳以資統計、六日經遵轉令浚河各區長遵照矣、</p>
<h3>南通　查緝沿江海走私</h3>
<p>通屬沿江海一帶、近來時有奸人、勾結日韓浪人、用沙船載運私貨、從冷僻港口卸運、南通區專署、刻令各縣水陸公安隊警、嚴密查緝、濱海區域、由水上公安三區各大隊負責、</p>
<h3>嘉興　繭行分別停秤</h3>
<p>嘉興今歲繭行、全邑共有五十餘家、收種土種之各繭行、早經停秤、收買改良種之各繭行、開秤己有九日、大部份均於休息日起秤、本屆因來貨擁擠、故各繭行均溢出原登記數額、且因蠤收時己牽長、故供應商停秤後、鄕間尚有多量鮮繭仍要求繼續收繭、致　成糾紛、幸緯成幾廠尚在收買、附近鄕民多肩往售賣、而遠處鄕民深感不便、故由地方人士、電請統製管理收繭委員會、設法救濟、未知如何辦理、</p>
<h3>慈谿　修志館之采訪員</h3>
<p>慈谿縣志、歷年旣久、二月間由縣政府召集各鄕人士、議决重修、公推楊省　為館長、陳屺懷為總編纂、規定縣志項目、采訪條例、並派定采訪員、各鄕分區人手采訪、儘於本年內完竣、開始編纂、各方如有重要事實為舊志所無或采訪難週者、可就近與各區采訪員接洽、各區采訪員、城區社正誼、馮敬疆、東鄕洪左湖、南鄕　湘帆、嚴子經、西引咎辭職胡景園、葉繞伯、北鄕沈筱汀、沈秉仁、</p>

<h3>法律界納稅華人會　請改善界內徵捐辦法　分類營業捐分等失當　審査費不依標準評定</h3>
<p>法租界公董局捐務處、徵收分類營業捐、分等失當、及審査費不依標準說不定、衛生處無理罰欵恒不容市民申辯、界內納稅華人、僉以關於分類營業衛生捐分等失當、審査費之不依標準說不定、以及遞减房捐速予實現、與衛生處濫行處罰、紛紛函請法租界納稅華人會請求交涉、納稅會昨特函法公董局、令飭主管人員、予以改善、茲錄原文如下、</p>
<p>營業捐等分等失當</p>
<p>逕啟者、案據界內納稅華人、僉以關於分類營業衛生捐分等失當、審査　之不依標準說不定以及　减房捐速予實現、與衛生處濫行處罰等情事、紛呈到會、請求交涉在案、査一九三六年貴總　重頒分類營業衛生捐章程、分為甲·乙·丙·丁·四等一項、關於分等標準、並無明文規定、再審査費原定最高額為十元、但在章程第六條第四目所載、凡在中國式單間房屋內、開設甲·乙·丙·丁·分類小營業者、其審査費得减至二元正、又同目凡照乙種營業第二表之小工業、其審査費得减至乙元正、然期査員甚少依照標準評定、至於捐級尤為全憑調査員之臆斷　測、成為最近局方與市民紛爭之焦點、例如</p>
<p>加捐之部紛爭焦點</p>
<p>（甲）加捐之部、　勞神父路一五○·一五二號盈康醫園、向為二元八角、今增至七元、　金神父路十二號福正元酒行、向為一元四角、今增為二元八角、　甘世東路六十四號喜慶永酒行、向為一元四角、今增至為二元八角、　白來尼蒙馬浪路一八○號章鴻生酒行、向為一元四角、今增為二元八角、此等加捐、緣何標準根據、統無明文通知、苟以門面之大小為標準、則該四家之門面如舊、並無擴展等事、苟以營業之盛衰為標準、則該四家之營業、未曾好轉、且不若向來之盛、旣無標準可循、則是項加捐、商店所未能承受、實有理可據也、</p>
<p>審査費部亟宜公允</p>
<p>（乙）審査費之部了、一、寗波路一○一號裕丯公司、僅租客堂一間、寬彌尺度、以及用人均合於小營業者、而捐務處强令其繳納審査費十元、關於收取審査費之失當、迨為普遍情形、實不止裕豐公司一家、依照章程規定、最高額為十元、若居住房屋以及店鋪之陳設、屬於小營業、則得减至二元或一元、査二元一元至十元、其中差級甚多、細譯條文意義、調査員必須審察該店營業之大小、而後評定、苟不需繳納十元者、則應繳若干、亟宜以最公允之眼光估定、今調査員每每不加審察、不曰二元、即為十元、未聞有其他之數目、於是商　枉受武斷者、不可勝數、裕豐公司此其一例、尚有其他、何勝枚舉、此尤所盼望捐務處、加以整頓者也、</p>
<p>要求照比例减房捐</p>
<p>再査貴公董局、一九三六年預算案內開、房捐計算法、如房租係用為租値根據時、則此房租總額應按房東給與房客享用利益之多少比例遞减、以便計算、　含有自來水供給房租、應减低百分之五、　含有電氣供給之房屋、應减低百分之五、　含有垃圾焚化　設備之房租、應减低百分之十、　含有電材設備之房屋、應减低百分之十、明文旣頒、而事實尚未遞减、以致引起納稅人之質問、此應請公董局通飭界內經租賬房、迅將房租情形呈報核减、以昭實在、</p>
<p>衛生處濫罰宜改善</p>
<p>再査界內關於不衛生之處罰案件、方法上甚有改善之必要、現在工部局調査員、只視垃圾堆存之所、卽據為對象、於是誤罰之事、日有所聞、而人民受誣、捕房恒不容其申辯、甚且加以毆辱、殊欠正當、他若康悌路一五三號瑞興飯館、因遵巡路西捕之命、代掃攤販浪籍之垃圾、反為工部局予以不衛生之處罰、此種措施、尤屬荒謬、應請令飭捐務處迅予校正、此等謬誤情事、以免枉屈無辜也、所有上述、純屬界內普遍情形、亦為糾紛最多之情形事、統希迅令主管人員、予以改善、並盼見復為荷、此致法律界公董局總董巴黛斯、</p>

<p>兩無成就之徒、始退而習醫、稍讀湯頭歌訣、即出而應世、為學旣膚淺如是、社會對之、賤等巫祝、其不護國法之保障也宜矣、近三十年來、幸賴政府之提倡、推行新醫、不遺餘力、人才漸衆、實效漸著、然社會積重難返之輕醫心理、迄未稍改、馴至行政員吏、亦不免溺惑流俗之見、竟有摧殘醫權者、此次　會召集第四次全國代表大會、據各地會員團體報吿、或以</p>

<p>當地醫師</p>
<p>公會、派員列席、貢獻意見、採納訂定、庶幾無偏無倚、易於實行、更祈嚴令公安當局、愼母濫施職權、對於正式醫師、不得逮捕拘禁、或審問處罰等、以崇醫　、而維醫權、又現行醫師暫行條例第四條、不給予醫師證書之第一欵、非因從事國民革命、而曾判處三年以上之徒刑者、自新刑法施行以來、此項規定、已失之有苛、緣新刑法第二七六條第二項載、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （肖白）</p>
<p>人生本來就是戰鬥。</p>
<p>學問是沒有止境的，我們生存在這世界上，就必須天天為適應自己生活的需要、去努力充實自己，認識這世界，養成應付一切非常事變的力量。</p>
<p>人們是有兩種敎育的，一種是受之他人，一種是得之自學。而後者實在更重要於前者。</p>
<p>我們必須學習，學習，再學習，因為愈學習，就愈加發現自己的無知與錯誤，而糾正和改進了自己。</p>
<p>我們不能重視自己，但也不可輕視自己，要知道一個人是沒有力量的，但兩個人就大了一點，許多人團結在一起，那就能引起質的變化，而發出非常的力量。</p>
<h3>悼兪劍華先生</h3>
<p>— 蜻</p>
<p>嗚呼，先烈陳英士先生廿周紀念之辰，我太倉同盟先進兪劍華先生卒于里第之日，一代英才，竟以病廢，不克盡其懷抱，以盡瘁黨團，為文臺發露異采、鬱鬱以終，年僅五十二，所著不過劍華集，翩鴻記傳奇，荒塚奇書三種。兪先生病廢十餘年，子女糼弱，家境蕭條，幸賴柳亞子陶小柳葉楚傖馮心俠先生之資助，及其夫人之賢，伏侍得宜，不使兪先生加一穩悉，不使兒女失一天學，不然，先生墓草宿矣，安得延生十年，視兒女之學成哉！兪先生名諤，字劍華，號一粟，婁東奇士也，工詩詞，而豪于飲，為南社之雋。先生弱冠時，游學日本，刻苦勵志，業乃孟晉。復與馮心俠先生，學于震旦大學，共謀毀聖母石象，為法人所忌，遂去之，漫遊四方，如魯如閩，如粤如燕，如南洋羣島間，所至輒與革命志士遊，時以著述投諸革命雜誌，復從陳去病柳亞子高劍公諸先生南社，盟子吳縣虎邱之張公祠。其後敎授詩詞于暨南大學，鬱鬱不得志，以疾引歸，養疴弇山，吟詠自遣，于是倩友人繪小窗吟夢圖以見志。然其少年時仗策走四方，備歷艱辛，出生入死，意氣之雄，仿彿方山子馬上論用兵，熟知不二十年以病廢哉！初先生僅神經衰弱，繼則兩手掣瘲，最後全身麻痺，因此知覺不鈍，客有訪之，則兩目炯炯注視，問之必數分鍾漸漸吐一二語，飲食起居，皆藉其夫人者也，嗚呼苦矣。</p>
<h3>已爛之梨</h3>
<h3>廿八年前一張申報</h3>
<p>— 籌成</p>
<p>此次在蘇舉行卅週從戎紀念時，到會各同志，僉將三十年前往營內所用之各種物品，送會陳列，以留紀念，而以黃心貽收集者最多；除光緒三十二年常昭學會印發之徵兵簡章，及歡送新軍人祝詞，與步兵第二標一營左隊副目副兵餉單，考取陸軍隨營學堂考案考卷外，尚有宣統元年六月初五日本報第三張一紙，因上印四十六標隨營學堂全體學生合。攝之照片故也。斯時本報尚用油光紙而印一面，此照登入第三張第二版，高三英寸，闊五英寸，甚明晰，在本埠新聞之前，上有「蘇州四十六標陸軍隨營學堂第四學期攝影」十八字，觀衆皆認為古物，而深佩其細心。當時本埠新聞，分城內，南市，閘北，英租界，美租界，法租界六欄。上有「査禁嗎啡藥針」新聞一則，謂「本縣田大令，訪得本邑各鄉，與奉賢靑浦華亭南匯各縣交界之處，有人將嗎啡藥水針，為人針刺，以代鴉片，愚民不知利害，祗圖一時受用，不顧日後之毒入肺腑，傷害性命殊為可憫，昨特飭差下鄉，嚴密拘拿，勿　貽害。」豈料二十八年後，此種害人不淺之嗎啡針，依舊未能禁絕，不禁慨嘆！另有「魚販罷市三誌」之新聞，謂「由商會各董竭力解勸，可望就緒，據云仍照舊章，不改洋碼，其餘善後辦法，准於十天內，由虞洽卿觀察出為妥議，再行宣布。」可見當時之虞洽卿，已在調停商事糾紛矣。</p>
<h3>穿獸皮之殘忍</h3>
<p>— 逸梅</p>
<p>人御獸皮，實為蠻俗，蓋上古時代，人民不知植棉製衣之法，於是獵獸取皮，以為御寒之具，及嫘祖發明蠶絲，黃道婆首創　棉後，衣服乃大備，固無需獸皮以彰身，但習慣已久，未易革除，迄今猶以皮裘為尚。一昨聞陸士諤君談：「刲取獸皮，實為殘忍手段，而尤以珠皮灰鼠為甚，珠皮非天然如此，乃於隆冬日，縛羊而盡去其毛，然後推之冰雪中，羊凍極，身顫不已，遂生　毛作粒狀，即所謂珠皮也。灰鼠一名靑鼠，深灰色，腹白，尾毛鬆而長，性靈敏，善跳躍，吉林諸山有之，旣捕得，以燒紅鐵扦，自鼠之肛門通入，鼠大痛而掙扎，油汁遂透溢皮毛中，望之自有光澤矣。又紫貂性最仁慈，捕之者預服紅砒，裸臥雪中，紫貂知之紛紛來，偎傍以增暖，裸臥者突起搤之，火熔之鉛，强灌貂口中，貂痛極滾地，油亦因此外透。」故陸君雖御裘，然絕對不穿珠皮灰鼠紫貂三種云。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二回　芳草麗人天微波乍托　小樓明月夜好夢初溫</p>
<p>他說　了，又微微的作了一次會心的微笑，抽出胸襟上帶的自來水筆，在幽怨餘年這四個字邊上，密密的書了兩行雙圈。於是把這篇短篇小說，一個字不漏的看了下去。看完之後，忽然有一種什麽感想似的，立刻在書架子上，書櫥子裏全搜尋了一陣，搜出三四十本新出的雜誌，都放在棹上。這雜誌的名字，有題着春風的，有題着鵑聲的，有題着鶯　的，有題着瓣香的，在封面上，都是一幅極美麗的圖畫。他隨手取一本，坐下來狂翻一陣，翻到有署名意唳天的文字，就看看題目，還是將那自來水筆，把題目寫在一本很精緻的英文練習薄上。寫過了之後，再翻第二本雜誌。他把所有的書，都翻査遍了，依舊把書歸理到書架子上，書櫥子裏去。桌上的那本英文練習薄，却是抄寫瞭不少的字在上面了。他把桌子淸理了一番，將練習薄放到一邊，然後在抽屜裏，取出了一疊朱絲格紙，用墨筆再把練習薄上的小說篇名，重新騰正了一回。在每篇小說名下面，全注着，登在那一期雜誌，共多少字，是什麽性質。這樣費事的抄寫着，足足有四張紙之多，騰寫完了，自己也覺得得意似的，把筆一放，手捧了那幾張紙，躺在一張藤椅子旁邊上看，將每篇小說的內容，都揣摸了一番。耳邊下，似乎聽到有點息息率率的響聲，抬眼看時，却是丫頭小菊，已經走進房來了。便問道：你為什麽這樣鬼頭鬼腦的，要進來，走進來就是了。小菊笑道：我進來兩三回了。小姐都把心事放在抄書上面，我沒有敢驚動。夢蘭笑道：你也知道抄書是不能驚動的。小菊道：我那裏知道這些，我看到小姐，全副精神，都在那書上紙上，一定是有個意思。說着，不覺是抿嘴微笑。夢蘭站起來，把抄的那幾張紙，話在講議夾子裏，笑道：你笑些什麽？小菊道：大少奶說過了。這些書上都是很有味的鼓兒詞，小姐那一天晚上講一兩段我聽聽罷。夢蘭道：你又知道什麽叫鼓兒詞？小菊道：我怎麽不知道呢？大少奶也同我說過，玉簪記呀，三笑呀，玉蜻蜓呀，佳人才子，有趣得很呢。夢蘭道：你又知道佳人才子了。說完了這話，心裏却生了很大的感觸，於是將手扶着頭，　了椅子背坐着。小菊見她突然的生着悶氣，倒以為是言語衝犯了她，自走了。（三二）</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<h3>魚市塲一瞥</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>在一個陰郁的下午，我踏上了開往魚市塲去的市渡輪。</p>
<p>輪船在人聲　嚷中離開了雙層碼頭，水上飯店那塊霓虹燈招牌便漸漸地在我們面前消失了。</p>
<p>帆影幢幢，江水悠悠；我站在船面上凭欄眺望，那個大都會的輪廓，在我眼前幻出了一幅夢一樣的圖畫。船，鼓着勇氣向前行進，許多小輪和划子却劃破了澎湃的浪，剪開了江面的水，穿梭似的在來往交織着，嗚嗚的汽笛像是驢叫一般的，震得人們的耳鼓都有點發脹。大不列顚的帝國巨艦和商輪，却靜靜地躺在江心裏，露出了它的猙獰面目，彷彿是幾個吃人的魔王！</p>
<p>一小時以後，我們已脫離了大都會的繁華中心，而經過了工厰區域！楊樹浦；於是，那個乳黃色的立體建築物，便隱約地在東溝碼頭對面的岸邊出現了。首先，我們在萬綠叢中望到的，就是那面高聳空際隨風飄揚的國旗；接着便是「實業部上海魚市場」的八個大字。</p>
<p>我在面前碼頭上上了岸，在那兒倒遇到了好些來參觀的摩登男女。</p>
<p>這裏，除了一個最現代式的洋樓外，就是一個小菜場式的競賣場。東面是漁船碼頭，這時碼頭傍正停泊着十多艘光桅子的漁船；碼頭上及各處地面上都縱橫地嵌着無數小鐵軌，是作為運魚離碼頭及拖往各處之用的。碼頭共有三個。洋樓裏便是市場辦公處，下層有一所小型的銀行，係專辦理漁民貸本者，定名為漁業信託社營業處。魚市場辦公室共五間，其他儲藏庫及伕役室，電話室，廁所膳堂等均備。二層除了一個總辦公室外，還有理事室，會議室，檔案室，小辦公室，硏究室，圖書室，技術室，監事室，陳列室等。三層係職員宿舍及浴室。四層為太平台。五層是無綫電員與氣象員之臥室，六七層只有一個瞭望台</p>
<p>競賣場的西首便是各經紀人—魚行—的辦事處，那裏共有門面房屋二十七間，每一間就是一經紀人的號子。二層是各漁輪公司的營業處。</p>
<p>下層有冷藏庫五大間，製冰室一間，機器室二間，經理室二間，及處理室數間；據說共可冷藏魚類一千五百噸。在最北面是製冰處。</p>
<p>每開開秤時間是上午三時半，所以當我去參觀的時候，市場及辦公室裏却是　悄悄地，袛有嗅到一種極難聞的腥臭味。</p>
<p>回來，我又到濬浦局路的一段上去巡　了一週；那兒路傍正有一個測量師在測量，是預備裝置小鐵軌的。那裏，在沿濱全是蘆葦業，這是我正看到許多鄕人在那泥濘的蘆田裏採蘆箸，而往來魚市場的男女却頗不少。</p>
<p>風土小誌</p>
<h3>從我國傳去的日本菓子</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>菓子並非水果，乃是一種日本點心，和我國饅頭相像。裏面都是紫色的豆沙，外面包着有色的麵粉。紅紅綠綠，十分美麗。而且樣式並非單是圓形，各種都有。日本人稱他為菓子，而對我國的白色饅頭，仍舊稱為「饅頭」。但是日本的菓子，也就是由我國饅頭變成的。</p>
<p>據日本人考據我國的饅頭，發明於漢朝。「事物起原」上載「諸葛亮南征將瀘水，土俗以人首祭神，亮令下以羊豕代取麵人頭祭之，饅頭名始之。」那時中國只有肉饅頭，因為模倣蠻人的頭顱，故名蠻頭，後來才轉訛為饅頭的。「七修類稿」上載，「當初書蠻頭，自諸葛武候始」可以證明。又一說饅頭，初名曼頭，曼者為用麵幔覆之意，頭為宴會中最初的食物。故「廬諶祭法」有「春祠用曼頭」之句。兩說未說孰是，但是創始於漢代，則可無疑。</p>
<p>日本最古的饅頭，是鹽瀨菓子舖，已有六百年的歷史。最初傳入日本的，是我國宋代的林凈因。當時日本京都的建仁寺龍山禪師入宋，林凈因歸依為門弟子，同至日本，於是才有奈良饅頭。林凈因為隱士林和靖的后裔，傳說林和靖的書室旁邊，有一棵庵蔓樹。便擬着他的果實形狀而造成饅頭，故當時林家的饅頭，是有名的。</p>
<p>林凈因在日本娶了妻子，生二男二女。長子名無等以倫，為建仁寺塔中兩足院的開祖。次男惟天盛祐便改營饅頭生意，開在京都的烏丸　條下町，是日本菓子舖的始祖。這處地名也就通稱了饅頭屋町。後來惟天盛祐的兒子紹絆，又到我國硏究了數年，才回到日本，　居於鹽瀨村。改姓鹽瀨，而鹽瀨饅頭，亦由此得名。</p>
<p>德川時代關原合戰時候，德川家達公用饅頭放在兜裏，祭祀天地，祈禱戰勝。於是又有兜饅頭之稱，而成為犒賞三軍的食品了。日本的菓子，完全作為茶點之用，所以和茶道有密切的關係。當時貴族有閑階級，很嗜好茶道，因此菓子便連帶的被重視着。提了許多雅名，如「舞鶴」「朧夜」「洲濱」等，即今之銘菓。</p>
<p>饅頭的營業，旣然風行之後，倣製的不知其數。雖然限制恊定之後，京都市內尚有二百餘家。粗製濫造，大非昔比了。東京原稱江戶，並無此種菓子。直到松平越中守，至西京，嘗着了饅頭的美味。於是特地到京都去召了菓子司來製造的。現在日本各處都有菓子了，他們吃着了我國傳來的饅頭，或是還要認為是日本的特產呢。</p>
<p>在日本的中國飯館，國為我國留學生中，有一部份是喜歡吃麵食，因此有饅頭包子出售。倡日本人來吃的不多，因為他們對於肉饅頭，總不及甜菓子的歡喜。</p>

<h3>市童軍大會　昨因天雨中止露營　各團童軍紛紛賦歸課程比賽改期舉行</h3>
<p>昨日為本市童子軍第七次大會第三日、預定上午紀念週、下午課程比賽、奈天不作美、前夜起風雨交作、營地頓成澤國、泥濘載道、行不得也哥哥、童子軍衣履　濕、狀極狼狽、爰由會務主任冷雪樵昨晨臨時在總辦公處召集全體團長會議、議决因天時關係、不得已中止露營、課程比賽則將通吿改期假南市大吉路市一體育場舉行、於是盛極一時之大會、暫吿段落、各團童子軍紛紛冒雨拔營、汽車公司莫不利市三倍、昨晚留駐營地者、尙有市商會·華成·郵工·及吳淞中學等團、尤以市商會及吳淞中學兩團全體繼續露營為最難能、大會總辦事處、今日照常在營地辦公、明日起遷回南市童子軍理事會辦公、國民社記者昨特往營地巡視一週、茲將營地花絮、略誌於後、</p>
<p>不速之客大為掃興</p>
<p>七日夜間、兩師風伯惠然蒞場作不速之客、全體童軍莫不為之蹙額、八日淸晨、師伯猶戀戀不肯去、各團長好比熱鍋上螞蟻、緊急會議、三十六着、拔營上策、否則兒童受寒、如何善後、於是决議露營中止、比賽改期、大家拔營、掃興之至、</p>
<p>電話不息汽車不絕</p>
<p>露營决定中止、各團凖備開拔、於是大會特裝之電話機四週、滿立打電話人、你叫搬場汽車、我叫客車、自五時迄中午、電話不息、同時市政府前、汽車亦時來時往、不絕於途、空空而來、滿載而去、</p>
<p>火燒連營烟雨滿天</p>
<p>童軍冒雨拔營、泥汚滿身、汽車又珊珊來遲、等車心焦、苦中尋樂、焚火為嬉、於是昨夜安眠之稻草、盡遭祝融大刦、一時全塲火光融融、滿天烟雨迷漫、好似火燒連營七百里之縮影、亦大會特別節目、</p>
<p>餘勇可嘉自尋快樂</p>
<p>省立上中樂隊、係本市童軍界唯一軍樂好手、大檢閱時亦由其奏樂、抑揚頓搓頗為觀衆稱道、昨午各團開拔幾盡、他們還是固守老營盤、大吹大播、啼啼打打、可謂大會「尾聲」、不怕風雨、鼓其餘　、自尋其篷帳樂趣、</p>
<p>殘餘稻草爾搶我奪</p>
<p>營地燒剩之稻草、其數尙不在少、附近貧民、見之十分眼熱、初向童軍索取、後則大舉搬運、濕透殘草、頓如寶貨、爾搶我奪、捆載而去、意外收獲、貧民不無小補、</p>
<p>光頭運動積極提倡</p>
<p>蔣委員長提倡新生活運動、各地民衆實行新生活運動、本市正始·大公等校提但光頭運動、聞風　　者尙在小數、此次大會營地副總幹事檢閱指揮謝烟波兪菊廬等、以光頭確屬經濟衛生、並可顯示勇敢精神、故於營地當衆當落髮、由靑年會中學某童軍執刀、故分文不費、經濟之至、惜乎繼起之人、任彼二人專美、</p>

<h3>供求相仿　外匯過程尚平</h3>
<p>匯市昨華商雖仍扒結、但因銀行賣胃敏活而難堅、晨初以外電倫敦大條、近遠期俱長〇六二五、紐約銀市勿動、蒙得里遠期銀價漲一厘三至一厘八不等、倫敦生金漲二便士半、英對美縮〇六二五、英對法勿動、美對英升二五強、美對法勿動、中央銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平、海關金單位漲四厘、匯市晨開、近期賣價英匯一先令二便士三七五、美匯三十元、較之前收、計英平而美鬆〇六二五、惟開後美匯即形略緊、銀行遂來塞出、始漸轉平、匯豐掛牌揭曉、英美俱平、此後銀行互有對做、大勢徘徊、白銀平衡稅揭曉升半分、新豐洋行來扒、美金大勢、亦乏影響、入後銀行趁賤對做、午刻趨勢仍平、後市因華商扒結、路透電傳來利買消息、助長買氣不少、無如銀行賣胃仍旺、終難變化、印銀報長一安那、最後大勢不定、收盤近期賣價英匯一先令二便士三七五、美匯三十元、較之上週六、計英平而美鬆〇六二五、遠期計英緊〇三一二五、美金則鬆〇六二五、華商約扒美金四十萬元、今將一天成交錄後、</p>

<h3>拆息不動毫洋微縮</h3>
<p>昨金融行市、仍屬安定、市場交易、略形繁瑣、拆息依舊八分、早午同市、拆票交易、早市轉賬二百八十餘萬、新交易二十餘萬、午市交易三十餘萬、小總會交易二十餘萬、鈔票發出五十餘萬、外埠三十餘萬、洋押欵交易取購四十餘萬、新做出八十餘萬、銀行收解、外商銀行收解票欵二百八十餘萬、各種貨匯雜欵二十餘萬、華商銀行收解票欵三百三十餘萬、各種貨匯稅雜欵收解三百六十餘萬、電匯欵三十餘萬、特種匯欵四十餘萬、日商銀行收解票欵二百二十餘萬、各種貨匯雜欵收解二百六十餘萬、電匯欵二十餘萬、特種匯欵三十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解四千七百餘萬、洋劃頭收解三百三十餘萬、各路匯饗五十餘萬、輔幣市況、早市成交廣東小洋三萬五千角、午市無交易、暗盤行情較前日小一厘、為十一角九分六厘、銅元暗盤為為三百零二千五百又、成文一萬一千四百元九十五串、合代價法幣三千八百元、</p>

<h3>證券　公債行市上落無定</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所因當避一再闢謠、人心比較穩定、故初有散戶補空血漲、但以粵省敎育界提早三星期放假、又使人心多所顧慮、西報則謠言未息、故又有轉趨疲軟之現象、場內因大戶仍有賣出、並以西北災振會之存貨源源流出、吸收現欵、買進外匯、現金又不斷的流出、加以走私之嚴重、債市本身、實受創甚深、前途尚難樂觀、昨日經過、上午開盤、散戶買進、六號亦有抵補、上漲二角至四角、次盤繼續上漲、三十五號等均有需要、再好一角至三角、小起回風、亦意中事午後形勢又疲、四號十六及三十四等之賣出、回小一二角、收盤又有無稽之謠、四號十六號二十二號賣出甚湧、跌勢稍厲、又小五分一角至四角半、市價結果、多數尚微好一角左右、成交總數、共計五百五十二萬元、茲將其漲跌結果比較列表於後、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>紗花　現銷起色　棉紗跌勢稍緩</h3>
<p>紗市平靜、大勢不脫盤旋徘徊之局、但現紗銷場、蜀滇兩帮進胃繼續強健、人心尚好、惟一般浮戶、鑒於不良空氣尚未冰釋、傾向拋賣、且傳說大孚或將代某方面在本月份交貨、於是市態益挫耳、</p>
<p>本月紗傳有交貨</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、以外棉轉疲、市場空氣不佳、且傳上月大量收進之紗、大孚恐在本月交出、於此本月趨勢不振、人氣怠懈、市價緩步下游、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌二·三·四角、惟十一月期僅漲一角、午後開盤、近月跌風益熾、因浮言未能消散、但人後聞現紗四川雲南兩帮採辦現紗有二千包以外、人心重振、市價略形回高、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌二角、查賣出大豐一千三百包、長餘三百五十包、通記三百包、晋康六百包、協成九百五十包、恒益四百五十包、裕大七百包、恒德六百五十包、大昶八百五十包、同和五百五十包、益昶三百五十包、買進明德七百包、合興七百包、慶豐二千三百五十包、昶記五百包、豐泰六百五十包、長豐一千三百包、新華四百五十包、森康八百包、潤康四百五十包、元一三百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>現紗濁滇銷路大旺</p>
<p>現紗銷路益覺起色、查全日各帮買去統計二千五百零九包、售價平穩、各帮買額列下、</p>
<h3>新花形勢尚佳</h3>
<p>棉市趨疲、因美棉新花轉跌十五磅音、印棉漲勢和緩、人心忽見鬆懈、但市場交易未湧、仍係粗絨棉、一時無大量走銷之故也、但新棉情形較昂云、</p>
<p>標花陳跌新平</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月市況尚平穩勿動、以邇來現棉廠需繼續不衰、新賣者未見踴躍、二盤亦無上下、迨至三收盤有一部分說美棉新花回跌、而紗市平庸、賣氣徵盛而挫、近疲遠月帶下、結果各月比上日收盤均跌五分至角半、午後開盤以紗市乏力、而外棉消息有續落之象、惟新花情態殊昂市況平常、結果近比上午收盤價跌一角、新花漲五分至一角、查賣出賡豐二千四百擔、明德一千一百担、裕大二各九百担、恒益一千担、振大一千六百担、長餘一千一百担、生源二千五百担、買進長和三千五百担、長豐一千二百担、合興一千三百担、豐泰一千担、愼記一千五百担、信誠一千九百担、聚興一千一百担、森康一千担、大昌成二千四百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>靈寶花續有做開</p>
<p>現棉消費尚堪維持、廠需平平、來源全無云、</p>
<h3>華北棉田激增　氣候順適　可望豐收</h3>
<p>據某洋行報告最近各地新棉作狀況如下、鄭州棉田較上年增三成、氣候順適、洛陽棉田增一成、氣候極佳、陜西靈寶一帶、棉出增六七成、向種豆粟玉蜀黍而改種植棉花者甚多、氣候甚佳、月下苗長二三寸、該處本季可收一百四五十萬擔、（去年僅二十萬擔）以三十二四十二支原料為主云、</p>
<h3>孟買棉市上週激漲</h3>
<p>孟買上週期貨唯一特色、為七八月期白羅溪花之猛漲、蓋若干著名投機家大批購買後、零星空戶不得不從事抵補也、其後美棉上漲、繼續買進、高峯仍能維持、中途謠傳某多頭獲利了結、一度反動、惟國外堅挺、旋即回復、日本購買頗暢、中國呆滯、印度紗廠因生產品滯銷、正在減工之中、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>
<h3>三品紗花略跌</h3>
<p>八日大阪電、三品期紗跌四角至八角、近月為一百九十五元四角、遠月為一百九十三元八角、期棉跌一角五分至四角、近月為六十三元五角、遠月為五十九元八角、</p>
<h3>疋頭　夏貨辦足秋貨已發動　棉布清淡之原因亦在此</h3>
<p>昨日紗花雖微見下挫、然底脚甚堅、致棉布市盤非常穩固、日商行家自本月貨在月首開出細布數批後、已無意再售、市上人氣頗佳、細布售盤每疋微昂一分半之譜、邇來棉布滯銷原因、一在農忙、一在夏貨業已備齊、秋貨尚未登場、青黃不接之候、但遠路川滇等帮、深色棉布已見發辦、行將續見旺盛、故細布細斜等貨、需要亦逐步增加、怡和廠各擋粗布粗斜、因廠盤高昂、手貨售價步漲、昨各牌一律每疋升漲五分、其他各廠出品受其影響、亦微見回升、客路進胃以蜀帮漢帮浙路為較佳、川帮進各種色布五六十箱、漢帮進漂布洋紗色素府綢條子府綢格子廠紗細斜細布約二百件、浙路溫台天津仍以條素府綢較為繁盛、</p>
<h3>呢絨疲者仍疲俏者自俏</h3>
<p>呢絨昨日市銷暢達、珠羅紗白膠布、茶綠卡干黃斜紋、羽紗呢凡立丁、派力司螺絲呢、白直貢白嗶嘰等、公會上及茶會上均有相當開出、門市舖與裁縫帮有購進、貨價則多平平、東西國貨齊少上落、按需供平衡、堅者仍堅、疲者仍疲、螺絲呢白海令蓬·西貨派力司·凡立丁黃斜紋·紗斜膠布條子嗶嘰、花色貨點花呢等、依然挺秀、東貨派力司、白嗶嘰白直貢、春薄花呢、等依然疲弱、</p>
<h3>糧食　天雨過驟　期粉浮空抵補愈急　本月突漲四分七五</h3>
<p>昨日紛市上午開盤後、各月份市面一致呈良好之象、以洋麥報價、雖回小二三角左右、惟以時雨甚驟、連宵不止、故業內外人心、一致看高、本月份雖已為新粉時令、不過天雨過猛、將來出品、未免又受影響、所以一般浮空、不得不亟於抵補、廠家籌碼、又小放出、多空相形、不免求多供少之感、喊價步挺、即屬此故、遠期各月份、交易甚暢價亦帶起一分外、迄至下午開盤、本月份因出少進多、市氣又緊、最高至三元一角二分、遠期初續好分許、後由多頭回脫、微見小落、後步情形、當看天時為轉移云、</p>
<h3>新麥客戶堅持　本月麥猛提一角四</h3>

<h3>兩隻紅桃（下）</h3>
<p>— 范守</p>
<p>我這幾天病的經過中，最使我失望的，是每天一次的幾針「退熱針」。在平日我對於此類退熱針，確具相當的信仰，因我遇到親朋好友偶爾發發熱的小毛病時，應用了牠，總是十發九效，靈騐非凡。這决用到了自家身上，法寳不靈了。三天的高熱中，每天都在打針以後，反而增高一度半度的體溫。這只好說退熱針在我的身上未交鴻運之故吧。當然啦！打了退熱針反使體溫增高，是斷斷沒有這回事的。無疑地是因爲在打針的時光，正是我「發熱」厲害的時期呢。</p>
<p>反之，在這幾天的病當中，使我滿意的東西亦有。令我最滿意的東西，就是一隻冰袋。我在高熱第二天的晚上，因無法可想，終於想到應用冰袋。果然！也合當是泳袋交鴻運的時機吧，用了以後，就馬上使昏去痛消，神志淸爽。也更奇的，應用了一點鐘的時間，熱度竟然降退了二度左右。一隻冰袋放置在高熱時光的病人頭腦上，能使神志淸醒一些，這是當然的事理，很可說得過去的事；要是說能熱度降退，這或許不會符合事實吧？我甩了以後，使熱度下降，這或許是碰巧的事：就是運用冰袋的時光，正好是碰到體溫降退的時候，所以用了冰袋，體溫下降，雖屬事實，難免不是一椿巧遇的事實哩。</p>
<p>但，凡在體溫過高的高熱時期，應用「冰袋」，確是一種很合理很「王道」的理學减熱法。我們的民衆，大大可以採納，斷斷不要爲舊醫玄說所疑忌。</p>
<p>本來，扁挑腺炎，算不得怎麽樣的一種單獨的大病症：多半還是屬於許多毛病的一種病狀。這决發生在我身上，却足足病了一星期，高熱發了三四天；扁挑腺炎中，算是重篤的一種了吧。爲什麽發牛在我身上，偏偏是重篤一些呢？這也許與我素常的體質，健康少病，不無關係。大凡健實强壯的人，平日少病，於是不病則已，一病則多較人沉重。事實的確有此現象：譬如傷寒症吧，如患者體質健實强壯，每較常人重篤。理由呢？難道因爲體健者平日遇到些少的病原體，多不易感染致病，及至因感染而發病成疾者，則足證少病原體的致病力特別兇猛，特別厲害；是這個緣故嗎？——我們只作如是觀。</p>
<p>現在，扁桃腺炎這病，已經全愈，「紅桃」也消退得無影無踪了。如果究問起來：這是什麼藥品醫治好的？我倒回答不出。如其回答起來，我就得說：是我自家的身體醫治好的。所以這痊愈的主要功勞，還是應歸我自已的身子。譬如高熱的時光，針藥下去，並不見效。至少可以說功效不顯。以後到了相當時期，熱度自行退了。這自己退了的功能，不是自身體內的功能是什麽？以後一直到全愈爲止，都是如此：都不是靠着什麽藥石之功，而是我自身體內所調動的兵馬！（全身反應）努力抗敵的功績哪！如果要說藥石的功能，那末，如我這次扁桃腺炎一類的毛病，至多只能佔得大軍隊伍中的幾位勤務兵的位置罷。</p>
<p>但是，在有些特殊的病症，藥石的功能，仍十分顯著。少牠不得的。牠的效能，亦不在關雲長的靑龍偃月，張翼德的丈八長矛之下咧。所以把一切的藥品，都當成無關輕重的動務兵看待，亦是亦行的！</p>
<p>那末，我對於　次的扁桃腺炎，是怎樣的用藥處治的呢？</p>
<p>我這决的用藥，是很簡單。開始有點微熱，喉頭略紅的時光，我當牠受了點風寒，同時有點喉頭炎之類，就由自己處洽，用了二十五西西的蓖麻子油，通一下大便，喉頭用點嗽口的藥水，同時還用點兒輕微解熱劑。至次日，見病勢並未减退，而且增進，於是就拚絕一切的藥品，來作偵査的工作，最主耍的化驗工作，就是血液檢騐；於是就拿血液去檢騐一下，有何病理上的變化，發現。這時我就請了這兒的沙醫師主持診察。他的意思，亦以待血液檢騐的報吿來了再說，現時只有等待，不必用什麼藥品，亦不宜胡亂用藥。這一天，除局部的喉頭消毒藥片，及嗽口的消毒藥水之外，在晚上因熱度高昇，打了一針退熱針。（此種退熱針，各種傳染性的熱症，均可用而無虞；允其如扁桃腺炎一類毛病，　類「百病解熱針」，還算是對症的針藥呢）。可是結果，我很失望！打下去的時候，是三十九度，打後一小時，熱度並未見退，依然上昇，達四十度，我這一針退熟針，不是泥手入海，毫不見「退熱」之效了嗎？—不，如果不打這一針，我的熱度，或許還要昇高，說不定要到四十一度呢！對於針藥入身，不能立見效騐時，我們只能作如是解：</p>
<p>血液檢騐的報告來了！　瘧疾原菌沒有，　白血球數六千二百，　白血球的左頃現象極少。這樣一來，就可以曉得：瘧疾完全不是了，第二可以疑慮似的傷寒症，亦極不相像；因爲傷寒的白血球數目，通常還要减少許多，（普通一切傳染性的熱症，白血球的數目，總是增加，惟有傷寒，却反比普通人减少，這是牠的一個重要的特點！）同時，如果是傷寒症，其白血球的左頃現象，還要顯著增進些。所以照着這血液檢騐的現象看來，傷寒症是極不相像。當時對於我所預先担心的疑似病症，（傷寒）已放下一大半的心了。</p>
<p>往後的二天高熱中，用藥大致相同；或者說，簡直未用什麽特殊的藥品。局部的，不消說，仍然用點喉頭消毒劑。「退熱針」照常每天一針；因爲這是保定有利無害的東西。就是「利」時顯不出，害處總是絕對保得住沒有的。內服的解熱劑，除末後一天，用了一點之外，高熱期中的各日，始終一點兒未用。爲什麽我始終忌用解熟劑去解退我高高的熱度呢？原因還是恐怕傷寒症！血液檢騐的報吿單上，雖然明明寫着不像傷寒症，但我的體溫下降，相差只是一二度，並未全退；尤其是在三十九，四十度的高熱時，我的脈息，並不與體溫並行的增加，每分鐘時時仍在八九十决之間。這使我不能完全不顧慮到仍有一二分傷寒症的疑慮。（這也是傷寒症的一個特徵！病人的脈息不與體溫並行的增加。此方普通的熱症病人，體溫到了三十九四十度的時光，其每分鐘的脈息，總在一百以外，乃至一百二三十决不等；而傷寒病人則吾：雖其體溫昇高至四十度，共每分鐘的脈息，大多仍滯留於八九十次之間。—當然，例外的例子，也不能說一個沒有。）</p>
<p>凡患傷塞症，是不宜多用解熱劑的。這個理由，一定還有一部份的民衆不大明白瞭解。這兒，也得的略的解釋一下。大家曉得，傷寒這個病症，是有一定的經過時間的，普通一個傷寒症的發熱期間，是四個星期，這當然還指單單純純的一個傷寒症而言，如果有別的毛病併雜進去，發生了所謂「合併症」出來，那就還得延長時日了。就是單純的一個傷寒症的時間，已經有相當的長久了。在這四個星期的過程當中，就是傷寒菌在人體中作四個星期時間的怪，發四個星期時間的炎。在此發炎作怪的當兒，人體自然要發生出一種防禦抵抗的現象來，這種現象，便是體溫增高，便是「寒熱」。國家受敵人攻擊，免不了要調兵遣將來抗禦外敵；人體受病原菌的侵襲攻擊時，人體內部，也同樣要調兵遣將，以示抗禦殺敵。所謂體溫增高，就是人體受了病原菌毒侵襲攻擊時的一種調動兵馬抗敵鬥爭的表示。傷寒病人，在此幾個星期的調動兵馬高熱反應之下，全身營養的被消耗，是很可觀的；同時，心臟的工作，亦辛苦異常。解熱劑，牠的正作用，是一時的解熱，但其副作用便是妨害心臟！傷寒病人的高熱，若採用解熱劑，效力甚爲微弱，用後一時或稍爲下降一點，但因爲疾病本身關係，不久卽行回復上昇，無濟於事。然對病人心臟，已受了莫大的傷害了。若多用了，一面因長期的發熱，心臟工作已十分的疲勞辛苦，一面又受萬物的刺激，心力更加衰弱，終至有不勝担負之時機，此時唯有宣吿罷工，走上虛脫的境地。傷寒病人之不宜於用解熱劑，卽因爲用之無解熱之益，却有傷心之害。我這决在幾天的高熱時，始終未曾採用解熱劑者，亦因爲小心起見，以免「萬一」受害也。（完）</p>
<h3>眼病期的注意及預防</h3>
<p>— 子弗譯</p>
<p>春末夏初，是眼病的季節。都市裏的塵埃，鄕村間的花粉，都乘了初夏的强風，四出飄浮，紛紛欲在入們的衣服，頭髮或膚體間，尋求一枝之棲。於是眼睛受害的機會，便特別多起來了。每年當這一時期，眼病患者就格外多起來，這實是一個良好的證據。</p>
<p>風實是眼睛的大敵。由於强風的刺激，極易引起眼充血或流淚等小毛病，這還不大要緊。然而，風的來臨，必然是帶着塵埃做伴侶的。一入眼中，病害就由是而極易引起了。故在這一季節間，本來有慢性眼病的人，他的病症容易惡化；而眼睛康健的人，在這一時期中，亦極易生出種種眼病。因此，已有結膜炎或別的眼病的人，應特別注意，最好能時到醫牛處檢騐，作徹底的醫治。然而，事先預防，要勝於事後的醫治。所以眼睛康健的人，最好能從事於預防方面的注意，以求安然渡過這眼病期，却是最高明的辦法。</p>
<p>被夾雜着多量塵埃的强風，吹刮而引起的眼病，首先是結膜炎。誠然，有些時候碰得好，受了這種刺激，僅是引起單純的結膜炎，這已算好運氣了。若果於塵埃中雜着細菌，一道跑入眼中，就極易成爲急性結膜炎（流行眼病），眼充血，流淚，腫脹等較利害的眼病。尤其是在鄉村間，假使花粉一飛入眼中，便立卽會引起結膜炎。</p>
<p>還有一層，每當風將塵埃刮入眼中時，眼淚就會滲出；而同時，缺乏衛生常識的人，就自然而然地會用手來揩拭眼睛。這麽一來，汚穢的手指所付着的細菌，便會被傳入眼中，因而甚易引起流行眼病或麥粒腫病。所謂麥粒腫病，</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>卽俗稱針眼或眼睫瘡，是由於細菌入睫毛的毛根部化膿而起的。</p>
<p>然則，我人究怎樣來防禦此等風與塵埃的侵害呢？較爲容易辦到的方法，就是平日不常戴眼鏡的人，在這一時中，亦配戴眼鏡。當然，單祗戴眼鏡還是不够的，最好能於外出歸來時，卽用潔凈的冷水，小心地洗滌眼睛一遍。其法是用藥棉或潔凈的毛巾，蘸臉盤中的冷水，輕輕地分別揩拭眼睛。這樣做，可以發生了兩種效果：第一，使粘着於眼睛周圍的不潔物，統被洗落，第二，這亦是一種很好的冷罨法，使眼睛的熱度較爲低下，以消除受風塵刺戟而發生的眼充血。</p>
<p>此外，應當大加注意的，就是於洗眼前，必先洗手，方不致用污穢的手來揉搓眼睛。還有，當來往街路時，遇到了塵埃飄入眼中，切不可驚惶失措地亂加揩拭。蓋塵埃一入目，必然會刺激出大量的淚水，這是自然的妙法。因爲淚水一經流出，便順手會將塵埃洗凈帶出。如果我人亂加揉搓，塵埃便會被動着四方突刺，侵入了深的地方，那時就眞是自討苦喫了。假使塵埃不易取出，到必要時，應馬上至醫師那裏去檢騐。</p>
<p>又，當淚水帶着塵埃流出時，可用潔凈的手帕輕輕拭去。切忌用不淸潔的手揉擦眼睛，因爲這不特無益，反而有着極多的害麼。</p>

<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（八十三）急性全身粟粒結核</p>
<p>（Tuberculosis　miliaris　aouta）</p>
<p>問　什麽呌做急性全身粟粒結核？</p>
<p>答　這是身體內已有結核病的人，突然以惡寒高熱而發全身皮膚的粟粒狀結核性結節的病，是因爲結核菌侵入血流中而起。</p>
<p>問　爲什麽結核病入忽然發生這種病變呢？</p>
<p>答　大都因爲身體驟遇衰弱的誘因之故。像患急性傳染病，姙娠和產褥，身心過勞，骨和關節及腺結核等。</p>
<p>問　急性全身粟粒結核的病，狀怎樣？</p>
<p>答　大都以惡寒高熱開始，間有伴以頭痛嘔吐或其他胃腸症狀的，熱型往往是稽留性或帶弛張性，惡寒戰慄，在經過中反復不已，脈搏頻數，血壓下降。</p>
<p>問　患這種病的人，呼吸器內有什麽病狀？</p>
<p>答　呼吸器病狀，有咳嗽，（乾咳）咯痰，呼吸促迫，靑紺色，肺臟部呈打診時呈鼓性濁音，肺氣腫；到末期見呼吸不聲。</p>
<p>問　神經系中有沒有病狀？</p>
<p>答　神經系的障礙，起初訴强度的頭痛，耳鳴，眩暈，後陷於不穩，譫語，昏睡：終則現各稱像腦膜炎的症狀，（就是項部强直，寇尼喜氏症候，皮膚知覺過敏，搐搦，嘔吐，脈徐等。）但脊髓液透明，壓力亢進。脊髓液中可以證明結核菌。</p>
<p>問　粟粒結核的病人，除了上述各種症狀外，還有什麽病狀？</p>
<p>答　其他的病狀，爲本病所特有的是眼底網膜面有粟粒的證明。又胃腸也起障礙，見食慾不振，嘔吐，便秘或泄瀉。小便時有蛋白質存在。血中可以證明結核菌。</p>
<p>問　這種病在臨症狀有幾種形式？</p>
<p>答　大槪不出三種。就是腦膜型，肺臟型，和傷寒型。</p>
<p>問　怎樣診斷急性粟粒結核？</p>
<p>答　只要從其旣往有無結核病，頻脈，呼吸促迫，靑紺色，神經症狀；並眼底檢査，有無網膜結核疹。肺臟可攝X光錢照片，看有無微細的斑點。</p>
<p>問　應該和那幾種病相區別？</p>
<p>答　應該和傷寒症，敗血症，急性肺炎，腦膜炎，肺結核，瘧疾等相區別。</p>
<p>問　這種病預後吉凶如何？</p>
<p>答　絕對凶惡。普通二三星期內死亡。</p>
<p>問　有無治療方法？</p>
<p>答　簡直談不到治療。祇有對症的用些緩解病人痛苦的藥品或用維持心力，止咳，鎭痛等藥劑。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼疾病衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（九十）瞳孔</p>
<p>正常的瞳孔，是在虹彩的中央。普通左右是同樣大小，且呈正圓形。我們若在瞳孔領內，試行斜照法的時候，則呈黑色。試行徹照法的時候，則呈紅色。有時瞳孔左右不正，醫學上，稱曰瞳孔變形症。這種變形症常可見於虹彩炎後發生的虹彩後愈著，外傷性虹彩斷裂，脊髓癆，及腦梅毒等等。如果虹彩有一部缺損，則瞳孔卽可形成長橢圓形。一般缺損在上方者，多由虹彩切除術而起。在下方者，多爲先天性虹彩缺損。</p>
<p>瞳孔的大小。可用哈伯氏瞳孔計正確測量。在生理的時候。槪依射入光線的强弱，屈折狀態，調節作用，輻輳反應，及年齡等等關係而有差異。通常靑年的瞳孔較大。初生兒及老年的瞳孔較小。</p>
<p>瞳孔的直徑，若在生理狀態，則爲二至四耗。左右瞳孔的直徑，如有一耗以上的差異，則爲病理的現象。在醫學上，稱曰瞳孔不同症。此在屈折異常，綠內障，內眼肌麻痺，一眼視力障碍，及中樞神經障碍等時，常可遇見。</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（九四）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>對於有結核素質之靑年，應如何選擇本身職業，也爲預防上一重要問題，値得在此處一提的。尋常人之見解，以謂身體旣經贏弱，則所選擇之職業，當以安逸少勞爲主旨，例如敎師官吏著作家等是。這是完全錯誤的。因爲此等人大抵執務時間嚴正，絕難顧及身體之疲勞，或終日伏案不停，對於新鮮空氣日光接觸機會之少，係遠不及工作於室外之職業的。故爲此等靑年選擇職業計，還讓給農業園藝林業等野外工作爲宜。因爲至少限度，是很多機會享受日光及空氣的；此其有補於畢生，自非前者所可及。關於醫師一職業，因爲了解深切之關係，許多人也很注意及此；其實醫師每天離不開病人，誘發之機會比較最多，當然是不很妥當的！</p>
<p>最後還有一問題須提出者，就是有結核質之靑年，是否適宜於運動？我們的回答是：適當的身體運動，當然在許可之列，並且是不無裨益的。但現在學校方面所提倡之激烈運動，例如角力足球長鉅離賽跑拳術等，則發生過度疲勞，結果很容易使潛伏性結核變成進行性的，咯血之發生更屬不鮮，故絕對不能冒險嘗試的。這是國民敎育全部大問題，希望國內的敎育家都知注意及此而不加以盲目獎勵纔好。（完）</p>

<h3>牙齒常識問答</h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>第七章　牙患的治療</p>
<p>第一節　槪言</p>
<p>（第一五九問）　牙患爲什麽較其他疾病更應早治？</p>
<p>答　我們全身的細胞，大都自己有修補的能力，所以普通的疾病，不久都會漸漸平復，惟有牙商出了毛病，只會意病愈深，愈蛀愈壊，很少自然修復的希望，必待人工的醫治修補，病勢方能停止。醫治愈遲，則損失意大，修補愈難。而且人工所修補的，無論如何巧妙，到底沒有天生的那樣好。</p>

<h3>敬告北平學生不必示威運動</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>冀察政委會，三日發令禁止學生罷課，謂據過去經騐，罷課事件，輒發生於學期或學生考試將屆之時，學生每藉罷課，避免考試，各大學或其他學校學生，如有企圖罷課者，將予逮捕，或開除云云，我對於學生之示威運動，本來不大贊成，惟說學生只圖免考，藉端運動，則恐未必，如云藉端，必有端可藉，而後方可藉端，今國家不幸而得使學生藉端運動，此乃國家之不幸，亦學生之不幸也，雖學生中難免沒有藉端圖免考試之學生，我想這類學生，畢竟少數之少數。</p>
<p>不過我對於學生之示威運動，事實上旣不贊成，卽理論上亦可不必，試舉其略，有二義焉，　學生之示威運動，原屬數見不鮮，試問有一次未得悽慘之結果耶？語曰，國家興亡，匹夫有責，愛國之心，人所同具，正爲愛國之心，人所同具，所以學生不必單獨示威，豈學生有愛國心，而他人沒有愛國心乎？若云責任，則政府之責任，畢竟十百倍重於學生之責任，則政府之愛國心，當亦十百倍於匹夫，則學生父何必自尋煩惱，而爲此越俎代庖之事耶？　學生之責任，祗在求學，若學業無成，則學生之恥、，欲國家之富强，惟科學是賴，若科學不進步，亦是學生之恥，無論現在國家，正在風雨飄搖中，須要科學以救國，卽在昇平無事之時，外禍不至，亦惟賴科學足以自强，則現在學生之努力於學業，更當十倍百倍於平時，並且現在的戰爭，是科學的戰爭，無論學生之徒手奮呼，不足以濟事，卽用全國之力量抵抗之，恐猶無補於事實也，况華北之局面，是何等之局面，而學生處此萬鈞勢力之下，幾無喘息之餘地，尙有爭扎之可能乎？</p>
<p>話雖如此，我輩不居關外或華北之人民，所見驚心動魄之事尙少，偶或見之，亦不過僅於報紙上略露其端倪，或偶得諸友人之傳述而已，尙若隔岸觀火未及燃眉還得說幾句從容風凉之話，若旣處此種奇形組織之中，恐當無談話之餘地，還得使一般人民示威運動耶，學生乎！當努力學業，報效於後日而已。</p>
<h3>遇</h3>
<p>— 白玲</p>
<p>有一次，父親帶着母親，哥哥，和我從濟南回了一决家。</p>
<p>那正是一個春天，天氣已經溫暖了，曾經凝結住的黃河之口，在陽光的撫慰中，却起始溶化了。</p>
<p>我的家因避免水災的激浸，不知遷移過多少决，但是無論怎樣遷移，却終是免不了要受水流的騷擾的。這次是遷移在離河堤不十分遠的後嶺上的一所房屋里。</p>
<p>每當春天的來到，人們照例要被那不會磨滅的記憶所衝動，在開始度着沉愁與不安的生活了。</p>
<p>那黃色的渾濁的河水，流動着，有如一個吃人的惡魔的大口，在發怒！在吼呌！平原，山，村落，人影，幾次曾被它的洪浪冲沒了，呑噬了！</p>
<p>有人便能把自己的生命，從災難中拯救出來，然而却多半變做異地的流浪者，或是艇而走險，去當一個勇雄的匪徒。</p>
<p>在家住了不久，我們便遇到河水又在伸張了。這樣，祖父焦急的要父親帶着我們快點離開家。然而他却死命也不肯和我們一同走，他願意守在家里。他說水大了，他可以想法跑。他眞是一個固執的老人。他是作了一輩子辛辛苦苦的忠誠的農人。</p>
<p>第二天，天還沒亮，父親便帶着母親，哥哥，和我踏上了旅途。天落着濛濛的細雨。祖父把我們送上轎車，又陪我們走了一段黑的路。他依戀的神情，在口里喃喃的用着充滿了祈禱的口吻這麼說：「希望上天保佑你們，在路上平平安安的！」</p>
<p>父親看祖父異常的難過，便忍不住似的開口說：「我看一同走吧，你不必自己守在家里。」</p>
<p>祖父用手遮着嘴唇，吞吞吐吐地說：「你們不要管我吧……」於是，他失意的往回走了。</p>
<p>在路上，我們的心戚到莫名的悽痛！走到太平鎭，太陽昌紅了，我們有些喜歡。在路上吃了點飯，又是往前走。</p>
<p>剛剛走到王家溝，車夫驚慌地回轉過頭來，朝着父親說：「前，前，前邊不好了，大的出了亂子了！我老遠看見有一輛車滾倒在地上。」</p>
<p>「那麽，快，快，快轉回去吧！」母親愕然了。</p>
<p>「還是也行路向南走……」父親似乎有些經騐似的，他向四週望了一眼。</p>
<p>我和哥哥被嚇得幾乎要哭出聲來。</p>
<p>車夫依從父親的吩咐，便改了方向，向南邊的一條路走着。但走了不遠，忽然，從路旁一道陰溝里跳出八個粗莽的漢子來。手里拿着木棒子，直向我們衝來。「住下！前邊的車子。有錢快交出！」一些音聲激昂地嚷起來了。</p>
<p>父親怕他們會傷害了我們，便急忙跳下車去，顫抖地說：「相好的，我們是窮走路的，身邊沒帶多少錢，只不過帶了幾個盤纏……」一邊說，一邊翻動着放在車子里邊的幾個破舊衣包讓他們看。隨後，在一個衣包里摸出一個紙包來：「這幾塊錢……」</p>
<p>站在父親身旁有一個人直朝父親注視，同時父親也被他的注視而打動着，在開始向他搜巡。那人難爲情的樣子，微笑着，紅着臉對父親說：「你，你，你是不認識我了！」</p>
<p>父親唔了一聲，發着楞。</p>
<p>那人又說：「我，我是東莊的老六，你不記得嗎？我曾在你們後鄰做過長工呢。」</p>
<p>父親笑了笑，兩手拍了拍大腿說，「呵，我想起來了。我說老六，你，你現在……」</p>
<p>「我現在沒法過活……這幾年遭到水災，又加上兵荒馬亂，誰肯再僱我做長工呢……」</p>
<p>於是，父親便把握在手心里一個紙包伸出去，這麼說：「我說，老六咱們都是熟人，那麽，你把這幾塊錢拿去，大家吃壺酒好吧？」</p>
<p>他推了推父親的手，客氣地說：「這怎麽好這樣辦呢，不必，不必，你是走路的人，沒有錢一步也走不動呀！」</p>
<p>這意外的驚慌，倒使我們平安的走過去了。</p>
<p>父親又把那幾塊錢放進衣包里。</p>
<p>母親看了看父親，冷靜地說：「老</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>六不是一個很老實的人嗎？他如今也學壞了呀！」</p>
<p>父親咳嗽了好幾聲，像是沒聽見母親的話，他在眺望着那遠遠的一條寬大的黃色的渾濁的河流。</p>
<h3>屠塲</h3>
<p>— 孟華</p>
<p>是一個初夏的午後，我正從天橋的西市集轉回來，想朝前門大街走去的時候，不知怎的，竟迷失了正路，跑進一條不知名的小胡同里了。在胡同的兩邊，是一些低矮湫陋的屋子，刷在外面的白灰旱已褪個精光，黃泥，草根同磚碎全裸露着。我放胆走過去，但漸漸我發見這樣的木牌同紙條了：</p>
<p>「蘭芳下處」</p>
<p>「月月紅二毛隨便」</p>
<p>「天律新到，小桂香二毛隨便，包你滿意」</p>
<p>後面這樣的紙條是貼在一家門漆全剝落了的小屋子外面的。那時候門正敞開着，在古老的紅漆屛風之後，我看見一些赤裸着上身的女人圍在天井里的方棹坐着。一個年靑的漢子蹲在屛風下邊，正用凶惡的眼睛注視着我。我有點害怕，立刻忽忽地跑過去。</p>
<p>這胡同只是狹窄，可並不長，前面是一堆極大的垃圾堆，從那里轉過去亦許是一條大路，因爲我聽見了自行車的鈴聲。從我走過的這幾家人家看來，這裏是一個下等娼妓叢聚的處所，因爲每家牆上，都貼着那些木牌同紙條。但我還沒有走到盡頭，一個中年的婦人，聽見了步聲，從另一家屋子裏跳出來，瞧見我，裝點着笑容！同我打招呼，接着就顚擺着她的臀部，作出誘惑人去墮落的樣子。她的上身是裸露的，下面着一條紅色的短褲。「來呀！我給你開心！」他邊說着，邊走下來。我慌忙跑過去，背上像給淋上一陣冰水一般，渾身都打顫起來。終於我像一個逃兵跑了幾十里路的長途那樣子，頭亦不敢回走出了那條小胡同。</p>
<p>這是稍久之前的事。但使我認識這種「隨便」的內幕的却在一個初秋的午後。這印象無疑在我臨死的那一刻亦不會忘記的。它給我顯示了人世間的地獄的另一面。事情是這樣的：</p>
<p>我是時常出西直門外，到某個學校里去訪問我一位好朋友的。每决從一路電車走下來，邁過西直門的城基之後，拉黃包車的車夫就圍着我這樣喊：</p>
<p>「拉去呵，上海甸去哇！」</p>
<p>「上承達學校兩吊錢，要哇？」</p>
<p>當我沒有回答他們，那些車夫便換個笑臉嚷着：</p>
<p>「上黃土坑去嗎？坐我的車，包你的！」</p>
<p>「黃士坑是什麼樣的地方呢？」當我遇見我的朋友的時候就這樣的問他，因爲車夫的話我實在覺得神秘。</p>
<p>朋友雖在城外住久了，竟連這「有名的」所在亦不能置答。而當我把這問題在宿舍里的聽差面前說出來之後，那個聽差們，出乎意料之外那樣子驚詫起來。</p>
<p>「什麼？您兩位問這地方幹什麽？」</p>
<p>但他總於拗不過我們，在星期日的下午，我們三個人終於上黃土坑去了。</p>
<p>是一條湫溢而骯髒的小街道，街上揚着灰塵，灰塵里充滿着一種不知名的奧氣。從街的西端道口，順右手抹了彎，迎面的是一列用黃土塗成的小小的泥屋。外面三數個光着上身的男乞丐正在捉蝨子，胸前都有一撮濃黑的汗毛。他們用詫異的眼色望望我們，接着便用一種什着聽不懂的暗號的話語談論起來。</p>
<p>「喂，東邊有客人，朝西邊走第三家的順喜蠻好，剛從天津落馬湖來的。」他們中有一個站起來用手指着西邊向我們說。</p>
<p>我的朋友已經害怕起來，元自回去了。我們兩個人走到那房子的前面，在腐爛的竹簾前面貼有一張紙條，寫着：「順喜四吊隨便。」在順喜的旁邊還有一排小字，已經看不淸楚了。</p>
<p>有一個人從隔屋跑出來，一手提着一個上衣，氣喘喘地朝東邊走去。就是這時候一個漢子給我們掀起簾來，讓我們走進去。</p>
<p>迎面是一排土坑，坑上面津些什草。在什草的上面正躺着一個上身赤裸的女人，外面的坑上却是一個渾身赤裸的女瞎子，在那里輕輕地呻吟着。房里很暗澹，一股濃烈的臭味撲着我的鼻腔。</p>
<p>「順喜，接客！」那漢子高聲嚷着。</p>
<p>聽見了這聲音左邊那個女人頭亦不抬，眼亦不開只把蓋着下身的破夾被掀開。呈在我們眼前的是一個渾身冒着紅疹子，脚踝同關節已經潰憫憫的渾身脫得淸光的女人。</p>
<p>我全行昏去了，一句話亦說不出，一步路亦走不動。那位老聽差把二十個銅板拿出來的時候，那個女人才緩緩地張開她的眼睛。驟然，她扳着稻草坐了起來，用着火一樣的眼睛望着我，望着伴着我那個聽差。她下意識地一手撕下了一束頭髮（她的頭髮已經非常稀疏），一面擺着手勢歇斯特利亞地喊起來：「喂，快走，快走，這兒不是你們來的地方呀！」</p>
<p>她好像要走下床來。我慌忙揭起竹簾快跑出去。接着我就聽見一陣厲害的哭聲，里頭還什着那個漢手的粗鄙的野蠻的罵聲。登時，那幾個蹲在外面的乞丐就匆匆地朝那座房子跑過去。</p>
<p>為着這，我整三天吃不下飯，什麼時候這些被屠宰的人才能得救呢？</p>
<h3>山地貨行</h3>
<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>初夏的早晨，太陽還沒有透土，一堆烏雲就從東山背後推了起來；接着在雲片里洒下了一陣密密的細雨。</p>
<p>阿才公公從小船的布篷罅隙里探出一個腦袋來，向平靜的湖面上望了望，又倐的鑽回了艙里去。</p>
<p>「我五更里起來，到船梢去解手的時候，看見東方開口，就曉得今天一定靠不住的……」他一壁自言自語的說着，一壁伸手到「乾塘」里去搜索他的潮烟管。</p>
<p>「看樣子今天船是又不開了吧！你到茶館里去的時候，彎到萬源三行里去問問看。」他的老婆在生着行灶，因爲濕柴燒不發火，所以烟頭冒得一篷子；她儘用嘴凑在灶門口吹着火，一隻手却擦着眼淚。想起今天落雨，照理是又不能開船了，於是，她停止了正在吹火的嘴，朝着她丈夫說。</p>
<p>阿才公公却綴上一個紙煤頭，「叭啊！叭啊！」的在船梢上拍起烟來，老婆說的話他彷彿沒有領會。</p>
<p>鎭夏街上的人漸漸地熱鬧起來，社凟橋上的攤頭，也都一個一個的搭好了；僑堍下那爿茶館里已坐滿了一屋子鄕下人，在悠閑地喝着茶，高談闊論地討論一些山地貨行市，農村新聞。幾家小雜貨舖和一爿山地貨行也全脫去了排門，在整理那各種貨物，或把門前的貨架子搭出去。</p>
<p>鄕下人是三五一羣的向街上走來，有的戴着一隻破箬帽，披着一襲舊簑衣，有的却挾着一把雨傘。他們是來打聽小梅子行市和買東西的。</p>
<p>「開行老板，今天小梅子哈個行情！」根福走到行門前，向着那個大塊頭萬源三這樣打聽。</p>
<p>「行市還沒有來，今天下雨，恐怕不會有客人來。」他沒有表情地將那個圓大腦袋幌了幌說。</p>
<p>雨不大亦不見小，只是霏霏地飄着，飄着；陰濕低壓的氣候鬱悶得使人有點兒難受。</p>
<p>早飯的時候，一般鄉下人都相繼地回到家里去吃飯了；於是，街頭便也慢慢地靜寂了下來，—茶館里只剩了一隻一隻的空板桌，那個癩痢頭堂倌却寂寞地在收拾那些空茶壺和空茶盃。</p>
<p>在晌午時分，街市上又是一度活躍起來了；萬源三行門前已歇滿了一擔擔的滾圓的小靑梅子，許多待售的男人和女人都氣喘吁吁的在行門前擠着，不住地用衣角揩着額角上的汗水。可是行里的那支大秤，雖然照例像條死魚乾似地在廊簷上掛着，却不像開秤的樣子，只見幾個司秤和値行都伏在櫃台上說笑。</p>
<p>「還沒有開秤嗎？」心急的黃官寳一將梅子擔歇下來，就擠到人堆里去向大家問。</p>
<p>「沒有！我已等了兩個鐘頭快了。」阿鬍子回過頭來說。</p>
<p>小梅子一擔一擔地儘管挑來，已經差不多堆成了一個小山頭了；然而行里還不見動靜，時間却一刻一刻的過去，將近晚快了。</p>
<p>「今天倒底開秤麽？」一個女人等得有點不耐煩了，向那個伏在櫃台上說笑的値行問了一句。</p>
<p>「沒有一定！」那個値行的祇淡淡地回答了一聲，又掉轉了頭去。</p>
<p>焦灼，憂鬱，緊緊地籠罩在他們的週遭，他們覺得今天是沒有開秤的希望了。</p>
<p>萬源三捧了水烟袋伏在樓窗上呼嚕呼嚕的抽着，他望着行門前擠不開的人；想鮮泰淸鹽作託他收一百擔小梅子，他乘這客人少的機會可以壓一壓，反正鄕下人都要等用錢，挨到明天開秤，至少可以跌一半價錢—最多不過一塊一擔，至於淸鹽作方面，已經言定三塊半一擔連佣錢代收的。在「園戶」方面再扣一個一成回佣，况且秤頭還有出入？那兩百多塊錢不是很現成到手了麽。這終究比賺光佣錢是省力得多吧！他想到這里不覺微笑了起來。他望望下面那些焦灼的面孔，把水烟袋呼嚕呼嚕的抽得更有勁兒了。</p>
<p>天依然在下着雨，行門口的蘆蓆棚也有點漏水了，一滴一滴地滴在擠在棚子里的人身上。</p>
<p>「今天要是不賣掉，明天要黃了，怎麼辦呢？」一個擔心着說。</p>
<p>「沒有人要，去倒在地溝里！」另一個人憤憤地回答。</p>
<p>傍晚，雨已止了，但街道上非常的濘滑，行門已提早上了排門，那些園戶祇有失望地將原擔梅子挑回去，攤一夜明天再來賈，社凟橋港里那幾條行貨船，也一條不缺的擠在那里。</p>

<h3>「新婚大血案」中一座森嚴的古廟</h3>
<p>天一下雨，藝華攝影塲上是顯得更加憂鬱了，尤其是這幾天，又是矗着一座破舊而森嚴的古廟。雖然而中央的三尊大佛像，卻是顯出着非常和藹的神情。殿前的魚膏燈是半明半滅地閃亮着。在萬年查欺虛裏，香烟是永遠地縈繞着，這是很會使人引起的感覺的。然而，當你從四週再一回顧時，立刻恐怖就會緊抓住了你的心弦，四週不單是巨大的佛像露出着猙獰可怕的眼光是恣態，而在西面的那個角落裏，更是靜靜地躺着墨黑的，朱紅的五六具棺材。陰森之狀，直要令人不寒而慄！</p>
<p>這是藝華公司新片「新婚大血案」（卽「父子英雄」改名）中的一堂大佈景，而它是充分地籠罩着恐怖的鬼氣森森的雰圍氣哪。</p>
<h3>海棠紅故事</h3>
<p>這故事大概發生在十年前吧！</p>
<p>「海棠紅」是一個唱評戲的女人，為了她的丈夫是一個沒有出息的賭鬼，她辛辛苦苦賺來的錢，全都被他拿去賭完，後來，連自己的孩子也被她男人賣了給人家，老父又死了「海堂紅」自己也被一個督軍看上，在督軍府裏被幽禁起來了，後來，革命軍到之後，她出了牢獄，好像世界也變了，人事全非，以前的一切全都完了，不知受了多少的痛苦，最後，由親生兒子把她接去，於是，這個多年漂泊的女人，終於找到了她的歸宿。</p>

<h3>聯華花絮</h3>

<h3>Central Decision: Convene the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee to Discuss Current Steps to be Taken. Chiang Kai-shek's Important Report on Current Affairs at the Central Memorial Week. It is Absolutely Unbelievable that Guangdong and Guangxi are Preparing to Act Independently. The Central Committee Must Decide on the Issue of Peace or War with All Comrades. Convening the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee is of Utmost Importance.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, the Central Committee decided to set a date for convening the Second Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee to discuss various policies. (Central News Agency Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The First Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee was held on December 1st of last year. Half a year has passed. It is reported that the Central Committee will convene the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee in the near future, based on the policies decided at the Fifth National Congress, to discuss the appropriate steps to be taken at the present time. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Vice Chairman Chiang Kai-shek gave a report at the Central Memorial Week on the morning of the 8th, the original text of which is as follows: "Chairman, fellow comrades, I have just heard Mr. Ju's report on his trip to Guangdong to pay respects to Mr. Hu and express condolences to his family. Everyone must feel very sad. Mr. Hu's passing is truly a loss of a leader for our party. Originally, there was not much estrangement between Guangdong and Guangxi and the central government. For several years, the central government has always adhered to the principle of gathering the strength of China and worked hard to promote unity. After Mr. Hu's death, the central government believes that it is necessary to understand Mr. Hu's painstaking efforts to save the country. The opinions and political views of the comrades in Guangdong and Guangxi must be accommodated as much as possible. We also believe that the comrades in Guangdong and Guangxi will be able to understand Mr. Hu's legacy and further realize unity to increase our unified strength and fulfill our aspirations to save the country. This is the central government's most sincere attitude towards Guangdong and Guangxi recently. However, Mr. Hu has just passed away, and everyone is very sad. There is no mood to discuss any issues other than mourning and sacrifice. Therefore, when Mr. Ju and several comrades went to Guangdong, the central government decided to go purely for condolence and condolences to the family, and to discuss Mr. Hu's state funeral. Before Mr. Hu's funeral is completed, we will not discuss many party affairs and political matters. This is not only the right thing to do in terms of reason and emotion, but also in terms of the spirit of Chinese etiquette. Mourning and sacrifice must be sincere and focused, and full of grief and respect. It is really not appropriate to talk about these things when Mr. Hu has just passed away and everyone is handling the mourning and sacrifice. Moreover, the national crisis has reached this point. In the future, as long as we can unite to save the country, everyone's opinions can be resolved, and any matter can be discussed openly and honestly, and we can choose the best course of action. There is no need to rush to find a solution. Therefore, the central government sent eight members to Guangdong to pay respects, and all public and private banquets were declined. There was no discussion of party and government issues. Unexpectedly, there were many speculations outside, and there were rumors that the central government had proposed five conditions to Guangdong and Guangxi. These rumors are completely unfounded. People who say or believe these words have no common sense at all. I can also conclude that these words were not said by Chinese people at all. Only foreigners who do not understand Chinese customs, history, and the spirit of Chinese national etiquette would casually create such rumors to be used as materials for instigation and division. In the past week, there have been particularly many rumors from all sides, especially the news released by the Japanese Domei News Agency is particularly bizarre, saying that Guangdong and Guangxi are going to independently resist Japan and save the country, organize a military government, send troops north, and have already sent troops to a certain place in the neighboring province. Other foreign newspapers and telegraph agencies also spread the news in different ways, and some even speculated that the dispatch of troops from Guangdong and Guangxi was only in the name of resisting Japan, but in fact it was in collusion with Japan, and its purpose was to overthrow the central government. There are many, many rumors like this. We are not very clear about the situation in Guangdong and Guangxi now, but we believe that the spirit of the central government and Guangdong and Guangxi to save the country is the same. The comrades in Guangdong and Guangxi must have the same understanding as the central government that unity must come first in order to save the country, and that division cannot save the country. We must not lightly believe the various slanders in foreign newspapers, that is, to say that they are ready to act independently. Judging from common sense, we also believe that it is absolutely unbelievable. In any country, when deciding on foreign relations, the steps must be consistent throughout the country, and the actions must be comprehensive. Only the orders of one central government can be listened to. In particular, the issue of peace or war is a major issue that concerns the survival of the entire nation. It must be decided by the central government after considering the actual situation, and it must be decided by all the comrades of the central government. It is not something that a local government or a few military officers can independently advocate and act independently. This is not only not in the interests of the country, but also will lose the country's personality and reduce the country's strength, thereby aggravating the extent of the national crisis. The comrades in Guangdong and Guangxi are both citizens of the Republic of China, and they are all party members with a long history in our party. They will definitely not do this. Therefore, we do not believe in any of the recent rumors. Since the Fifth National Congress last year, the central government's foreign policy has been clearly decided and announced to the whole country. In the past six months, all foreign and domestic affairs of the central government have been done in accordance with the resolutions of the Fifth National Congress. The most important words in the resolution are: "We will never give up peace until the time of complete despair, and we will never lightly talk about sacrifice until the last moment." What stage has the current diplomatic situation reached? Has peace been despaired of, and has the country reached a situation where it has to give up peace? What kind of methods should be adopted to deal with the current situation? These questions cannot be judged casually by one or two people, let alone decided lightly by a few people based on subjective opinions. The decision of a country's fundamental plan is not a hasty matter. Not only do we not dare to decide the life and death of the country and the nation casually, but also all the responsible comrades of the Central Standing Committee do not dare to judge it casually. Therefore, based on common sense, we can infer that the Guangdong and Guangxi sides have expressed urgent opinions at this time. If they say that they have already taken action, I think it is mostly unbelievable. The above is the reason for explaining why the rumors outside are unbelievable. The only things that the central government has formally received are two telegrams from Guangdong and Guangxi. The central government attaches great importance to their opinions. Originally, our Central Plenary Session should be held once every six months according to regulations. All national administrative policies and implementation situations should be reported and discussed in the Plenary Session. Now the central comrades are preparing to propose convening the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee in the Standing Committee, so that everyone can have a more detailed review of the current national situation, a thorough examination of the government's facilities in the past six months, and a decision and instruction on the future direction. During this period of severe national crisis, this meeting is very important for the country's future. The general comrades in Guangdong and Guangxi are concerned about the country's safety and are very eager to participate enthusiastically and jointly decide on major plans. In short, I believe that Guangdong and Guangxi will never break away from the central government and act independently, nor will they use the name of diplomacy as an excuse for internal strife. In this difficult and arduous period, how does every conscientious citizen think? I believe the comrades in Guangdong and Guangxi must think the same way. Now there are many rumors. Brothers can tell everyone, and tell the general public, that we have gone through countless bitter struggles in the process of revolution, both internal and external. Now the general public's understanding of revolution and saving the country is becoming more and more common and consistent. Our revolutionary foundation has been consolidated. No matter what, the central government will be able to uphold its consistent confidence and policy, and lead the people of the whole country to protect the survival of the nation. As long as the people of the whole country have a correct understanding of the current situation of the country, are not confused by floating words and rumors, are of one mind and one virtue, and are firm and unswerving, they will be able to relieve the national crisis and revive the nation. This is the meaning that I want to report to you comrades today, and can also comfort our compatriots across the country. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>(Hengzhou) It is reported that two planes of the Guangdong Army landed here on Saturday evening last week. The two planes were obviously engaged in reconnaissance. There has been no news of the Southern Army arriving near Hengzhou. (Reuters Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Southwest Army continued to advance to southern Hunan. After the Guangxi Army occupied Yongzhou, 15 miles from the Hunan border, two more divisions arrived in Chenzhou today, 80 miles southeast of Yongzhou and 20 miles inside Hunan. It is now believed that there are Guangdong troops mixed in. The Central Army is now retreating north to avoid conflict. If the two Southwest Armies continue to advance north, they will converge in Hengzhou, 100 miles south of Changsha. (Reuters Dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>(Changsha) In recent days, foreign newspapers have spread rumors that the Southwest Army has sent troops into Hunan Province. In order to make the real situation clear to all parties, the reporter specially visited a certain important person in the Hunan authorities. According to him, this matter has been repeatedly rejected by the central government, and it is not worth discussing again. The Hunan Army is still responsible for suppressing bandits and pacifying the people in the front. Western Hunan and southern Hunan are very peaceful. There is no such thing as the Guangxi Army invading Hunan, nor is there such a thing as the Hunan Army being transferred to the Guangdong border. As for the saying that more than 300,000 troops have been transferred to the Hunan-Jiangxi border to defend against Guangdong, it is even more unfounded. I have never heard of it. It is purely a rumor created by foreign newspapers for other purposes. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Vice Chairman Chiang hosted a banquet on the evening of the 8th to welcome Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, Chuan Bingchang, and others who had been dispatched to Guangdong to pay respects to former Chairman Hu. Central leaders were also invited to accompany them. It is reported that Chuan Bingchang said that the location of former Chairman Hu's state funeral was desired by his colleagues to be next to Sun Yat-sen's tomb. Later, due to the opinions of his family, Hu had said in his lifetime that if he could not be buried in the ancestral mountains after his death, he should be buried with his elder brother, Qingrui. Since Mr. Hu received education and upbringing from Mr. Qingrui in his childhood, the bond between them was very deep. His colleagues, in order to respect Mr. Hu's last words, were also inconvenient to force him. It is heard that Mrs. Hu has surveyed the cemetery in Longyandong, Guangzhou, and plans to bury Mr. Hu within the period of July 7. She has already sent a telegram to me asking me to contact the central government about the state funeral. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) A member of the Suiyuan-Mongolia Political Council talked to the reporter in Nanjing, saying that the work of preventing communism in Suiyuan's Mongolian banners is carried out in two ways: active and passive. On the passive side, the Baojia system has been implemented to prevent bandits from mixing in. On the active side, blockhouses have been built extensively in various key passes to implement a firm wall and clear fields. More than 70 of the three advances have been completed, and each blockhouse is heavily guarded. At the ferries on the Yellow River, except for one ferry in each county to maintain traffic, the rest are blocked. Since the implementation of these two methods, the Mongolian banners have become more peaceful. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a Memorial Week at 10 am on the 8th. Feng Yuxiang, Deng Jiayan, Jing Hengyi, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Shuren, Chen Xunyong, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and other officials of the National Government and various departments and committees, a total of about 500 people, attended. Chairman Lin led the ceremony and gave a speech on "Explanation of Love and Sincerity." The meeting adjourned at 10:30 am. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke and Li Wenfan, who represented the central government in Guangdong to pay respects to Chairman Hu, returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 8th. They attended the Central Memorial Week and reported on their trip south to Vice Chairman Chiang. They then went to the National Government to visit Chairman Lin and made the same report. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ju Zheng's report at the Central Memorial Week on the morning of the 8th was roughly as follows: "When we were ordered to go south to pay respects to Chairman Hu, there were speculations outside that we were on a mission to discuss the situation with the Southwest authorities. As the situation has evolved recently, some people even think that our negotiations have failed. These rumors can affect the people's attention and make people's hearts float. Today, I will give a detailed report on the itinerary of my trip south. This time, we completely represented the central government in paying respects to Hu and condoling Hu's family. There was absolutely no additional task. We gathered in Shanghai on the 19th of last month and set off. We arrived in Hong Kong on the 21st and stayed for one day. On the 23rd, we took a car to Guangzhou. First, we personally paid respects and comforted Mrs. Hu. On the morning of the 25th, we publicly mourned Chairman Hu. On the 26th, we went to Conghua Hot Spring to bathe. On the 27th, we visited agricultural farms and factories. On the afternoon of the 28th, we attended a public banquet hosted by the provincial government, and then returned to Hong Kong to wait for a ship to return north. We spent a total of five days in Guangdong. There was simply no time, let alone time to talk about the situation. The outside world's rumors are completely unfounded. Hong Kong newspapers have made it even more sensational. In fact, even the issue of Chairman Hu's burial site has not been specifically discussed. This fact is enough to prove that I hope people across the country will recognize the facts and not disturb each other." (Central News Agency Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin gave a speech on the morning of the 8th at the National Government Memorial Week on the explanation of love and sincerity, saying that the four words "love and sincerity" are the legacy left to us by Sun Yat-sen. Love and sincerity are originally the cultivation efforts in the spiritual realm. Analytically speaking, love is for people, and sincerity is for oneself. Sincerity is the body, and love is the use. The two are indispensable. The highest morality of mankind is to serve society. Sun Yat-sen said that everyone should aim at serving, not at taking. The so-called service is based on the morality of love. Therefore, to expand it, if mankind loses the morality of love, all ethics, laws, politics, culture, and social and national organizations will only have form and no meaning. Everyone holds the idea of selfishness, competition, hatred, and killing, and the result is to perish together. Not only will life lose its value of existence, but mankind will inevitably have the worry of extinction. The current international disputes are endless because everyone has lost love and sincerity, and will eventually lead to mutual killing among mankind. Therefore, Sun Yat-sen concludes that in the theory of evolution, species are in mutual competition, and mankind has reached the point of mutual assistance. He also said that mankind should aim at serving. This is the truth discovered by Sun Yat-sen, which is divided into three points: First, if we spread Wang Tao's Three Principles of the People to all mankind, we will surely promote the love and sincerity of all mankind. Second, in terms of one country, we should integrate with the people of the whole country in terms of revolutionary consciousness, revolutionary history, and the responsibility of completing the Three Principles of the People, and we should all pay attention to love and sincerity. Third, from the perspective of the international situation and saving the country from extinction, whether it is the government, the people, or the comrades, everyone should treat each other with sincerity, gather ideas and benefit from each other, and based on love and sincerity, work hard together under the banner of the Three Principles of the People, according to the same belief and the same goal, in order to save the country and complete the national revolution and the great cause of reviving the Chinese nation.

<h3>The Preparatory Committee of the National Economic Construction Association was Established Yesterday. Liu Weichi was Announced as the Director-General.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Economic Construction Association changed the office of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce into the office of the Epidemic Prevention Association on the 8th. Wu Dingchang, the director of the preparatory committee, hung a wooden plaque of the "National Economic Construction Movement Committee General Association." The president of the association appointed Liu Weichi, the political secretary of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, as the economic director, Xu Shilian as the counselor, Yan Shenyu, the director of the General Affairs Department, and Jin Chengfu, the director of the secretariat, as directors, and Qiao Zengqu and Lin Fanye as secretaries. Work began that day. Wu Dingchang gave a speech at the Memorial Week, saying that all staff members of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce must assist in handling the affairs of the Economic Construction Association. On the morning of the 8th, reports and notifications were sent to the central government agencies, provincial and municipal governments, and various groups, informing them that the General Association had been established in Nanjing, and ordering each province and city to set up branches and immediately send personnel to prepare. At 5 pm on the afternoon of the 8th, Wu Dingchang convened Director-General Liu Weichi, Directors Xu Shilian, Yan Shenyu, and Jin Chengfu, and Secretaries Qiao Zengqu and Lin Fanye in the Minister's office to discuss the division of work and the procedures to be followed. It was decided that the Director-General should work with the Directors and Secretaries to first draft the organizational rules of the General Association and branches, and submit them to the President for approval. The first preparatory meeting was scheduled for the 9th, after the Executive Yuan meeting, when the committee members Wu Dingchang, Kong Xiangxi, and Weng Wenhao would discuss the candidates for the General Association committee and the budget. The preparatory procedures of the Association are expected to be completed in one week, and it can be formally established on the 15th. The expenses during the preparatory period are borne by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce because the time is short and the miscellaneous expenses are not much (Special Telegram, 8th).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Preparatory Committee of the National Economic Construction Movement Committee General Association was organized and established in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on the 8th, and a letter was sent to various agencies informing them that work had begun. As for the staff of the Preparatory Committee, Liu Weichi was announced as the Director-General, and Jin Chengfu, Yan Shenyu, Xu Shilian, Qiao Zengqu, and Lin Fanye were announced as the five directors. At 5 pm, Wu Dingchang, the Director of the Preparatory Committee, specially convened the Director-General and the Directors to hold a discussion meeting to discuss all the preparatory matters in the future. The first Preparatory Committee meeting will be held on the 9th or so. According to Director-General Liu Weichi, after the Preparatory Committee of the General Association begins work, it is expected that preparations will be made actively, and it can be organized and established in about one month or two weeks. As for the members of the General Association, in addition to the relevant ministers, leaders and experts in the financial and industrial circles will also be invited to be members, in order to gather the wisdom and efforts of the masses and actively promote this great economic foundation work. As for the branch presidents of each province, city, and county, the local officials will be the presidents, and the members of the branch will also be appointed or hired by the respective presidents. It is also hoped that they can be organized and established in the short term. As for the expenses of the General Association and branches, they will be frugal, and all the staff will be voluntary. Because this Association is a business organization, it is hoped that a great cause can be made with very little expenses. Now that the Preparatory Committee of the General Association has been established, it will immediately start drafting all detailed rules and regulations so that the work can be carried out and there will be something to follow (Central News Agency Dispatch, 8th).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Chaojun, who is preparing for the Nanjing Municipal Economic Construction Movement Branch, asked Wang Renlin, the counselor, to go to the Preparatory Committee of the General Association in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, since Nanjing is the seat of the government and a General Association has already been established, whether it is necessary to establish a branch at the same time. Liu Weichi came out to see him and said that Nanjing should still be established in the same way as other provinces and cities. Wang returned to the municipal government to report, and Mayor Ma Chaojun immediately ordered Chen Jianru, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, to start preparing for the branch. The candidates for the committee are being selected, and Mayor Ma Chaojun will also serve as the president (Special Telegram, 8th).</p>

<h3>How to Eliminate Foreign News Agencies</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>At this critical stage of national crisis, when foreign news agencies are wantonly creating rumors, the press is either actively unable to exert the power of public opinion, or passively unable to prevent the spread of rumors. The mental anguish is extreme. Recently, the Japanese Domei News Agency formally merged with the Denpō News Agency. Their country's news organization has been absolutely unified, and their government can absolutely control it. However, within a week of the merger, they created a rumor that shocked the world, saying that the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities had special actions against the central government. Foreign newspapers in Shanghai rushed to publish it, disturbing people's minds and shaking the financial markets. Only after a day did it become clear that they had been deceived by the Japanese news agency. The maliciousness of the Japanese news agency is deeply regrettable, but the excessive restrictions on the records of our own newspapers and the excessive indulgence of the government towards foreign newspapers and news agencies are also the main causes of such unfortunate events.</p>
<p>The reason why foreign news agencies and foreign newspapers have the ability to spread rumors, and why the readers of our newspapers can be deceived by them, is not a matter of a day or two. Since the government implemented strict censorship, those who care about national affairs have not been able to obtain detailed and important records in Chinese newspapers. Therefore, they quench their thirst with poison and seek them in newspapers run by foreigners. There is a reason why the sales of certain Chinese-language foreign newspapers have increased sharply. The average reader does not understand the source of various news, nor does he consider the background of newspapers and news agencies. When there is shocking news that is not available in domestic newspapers, they immediately believe it to be true. Domestic newspapers know it to be true but do not publish it. In the eyes of readers, this is suspected to be the result of government censorship. Therefore, the false is believed to be true, and the true is suspected to be false. If domestic newspapers have always had complete freedom of recording, this kind of abnormal psychology of readers would not occur.</p>
<p>Secondly, in this extraordinary situation, a considerable degree of news control is not unnecessary. However, once control is implemented, it must be effective. Under the current situation, there are too many loopholes, and the government is overly preferential towards foreign newspapers and news agencies. The Japanese news agency relies on the support of its government and is not subject to censorship. All kinds of outrageous behaviors are commonplace. Even Reuters and Havas and other agencies also enjoy excessive freedom and cannot be brought to justice. Apart from Domei, other foreign news agencies, although not maliciously creating rumors, always take the interests of their own country as a prerequisite when sending a telegram or transmitting a letter, and promote the policies of their country and the reputation of various financial and commercial institutions. When there is a conflict with China's interests, China's interests must be sacrificed. Even if they are subject to mild censorship, they still grumble incessantly. Foreign newspapers are even more unscrupulous, with Japan being the worst and Britain and the United States next. If we want to achieve the actual effect of news control, this is the biggest problem.</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Ding Bolie, a reporter for the Manchester Guardian stationed in Peiping, published an article in the Pacific Quarterly this month, complaining about the Chinese government's censorship of foreign correspondents' telegrams. However, Mr. Ding also firmly believes that foreign news agencies have strong subjective colors, and cites Japanese news agencies as an example. Mr. Ding also said that the official and semi-official news agencies such as Havas, Oceanic, TASS, and Reuters cannot avoid the color of the official arena and cannot fulfill the responsibility of objectively recording facts. Foreign news agency reporters admit this, so it is by no means excessive for the government to impose stricter controls.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Sir Leith-Ross met with Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Isoya at the British Embassy at 4:00 PM today for about 30 minutes, exchanging important opinions. (8th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Sir Leith-Ross, the economic advisor to the British government, had a frank discussion with Lieutenant General Isoya, the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Army Ministry and former military attaché to the Japanese Embassy in China, for two hours today regarding the relationship between Britain and Japan. Sir Leith-Ross expressed his opinion, saying that the Nanjing government should now be regarded as the most complete and powerful political organ in China. For this reason, providing financial assistance to the Nanjing government, enabling it to engage in economic revival and assisting it in building a good national administration, can greatly benefit the stability of the overall situation in China and open the way to maintaining peace in the Far East. He was particularly puzzled by Japan's attitude of not agreeing with the Nanjing government's financial reform plan. It is heard that Lieutenant General Isoya also expressed his personal opinion, saying that Japan is willing to assist China in economic revival, but because Japan has suffered painful experiences in the past, it is currently inconvenient to do so. Japan has close relations with China, so his current position does not allow him to consider providing economic assistance to the Nanjing government. Britain can implement its policies in China on a purely economic basis. (8th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Sir Leith-Ross, who was in Hakone, entered Tokyo on the morning of the 8th and went to the British Embassy. It was decided that he would visit Foreign Minister Arita at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the afternoon of the 9th, as previously arranged, to exchange important opinions regarding the coordination between Britain and Japan. Foreign Minister Arita entrusted Sir Leith-Ross, who was on his way home, to make the British government and people aware of the true meaning of Japan's East Asia policy in order to promote the practical coordination between Britain and Japan. The cautious attitude of the empire has been decided. Therefore, not to mention the three different attitudes towards China in North China, Central China, and Southwest China, the empire will also frankly explain the attitude of the imperial government regarding how China and Japan should implement cooperation to determine the destiny of East Asia, and request Britain's goodwill assistance, and explain that since Britain recognizes Japan's position in China, there is a fundamental principle for Anglo-Japanese coordination. Although Foreign Minister Arita did not attend the welcome lunch for Ross at the British Embassy at noon on the 8th, Horinouchi, a decision-making official, attended on behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (8th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Leith-Ross arrived in Tokyo from Hakone on the morning of the 8th and plans to stay in Tokyo for six days, meeting with Foreign Minister Arita and other government officials and civilians related to China to conduct important discussions. Ross plans to meet with the Foreign Minister first, and then with the military, finance, and industry authorities. Britain's traditional diplomatic policy has always been based on the principle of focusing on the local situation. Ross has been in China for half a year and knows the situation in China well. The significance of his decision to come to Japan again is extremely important. Ross met with former Foreign Minister Hirota last September and proposed the issue of financial assistance to China. In October, he proposed the same loan proposal to China. What proposals he will make when he meets with the Japanese authorities is the most watched thing by the general public. Foreign Minister Arita plans to hold a welcome party for Ross on the evening of the 11th. (8th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<h3>Shih Chao-chi Advocates Convening an International Conference</h3>
<p>To Resolve the Current Situation Anew, in Order to Avoid War</p>
<p>Durham. Dr. Shih Chao-chi, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, today received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Duke University and addressed the school's graduation ceremony, stating that if the countries of the world wish to avoid war, they should establish a new system of collective peace outside the scope of the League of Nations. Countries should convene an international conference to discuss issues concerning territory and other matters worldwide. The League of Nations has now lost its true power, and China has also recognized that it cannot uphold justice. He also said that if countries wish to avoid war, the major powers should convene a special world conference outside the League of Nations to discuss the redistribution of territories and other important issues. Countries in the East and West should participate in the conference, because the interests of all countries are inseparable. Shih also said that world peace today is in imminent danger, and the reason for this is territorial and other political issues. The League of Nations is only a tool for maintaining the status quo. Therefore, in order to eliminate the problems of territorial and population distribution and the shortcomings of current treaties, an international conference should be convened outside the scope of the League of Nations to seek a solution, and a new international agreement should be established based on the policies of self-preservation and coexistence, so as to promote international mutual benefit and cooperation. Shih also said that although this matter is extremely difficult, it is the only way to avoid war. (7th, Kuomin News Agency)</p>

<h3>Australia Increases Tariffs, Japan's Protest Ineffective</h3>
<p>Will Retaliation Be Implemented?</p>
<p>Melbourne. After the Australian government received a warning from the Japanese government on the 3rd regarding the invocation of the Trade Protection Act, it held an emergency cabinet meeting and urgently reviewed countermeasures. Prime Minister Lyons, who was on a tour of Tasmania, was contacted by long-distance telephone. After careful consultation, it was decided to maintain the new tariff system and formally responded to Consul-General Murai on the 6th, while expressing hope for effective handling. The main points are as follows: The realization of increased tariffs and import permit systems is not intended to prevent Japanese goods, but only as a means to protect domestic industries. Therefore, even after the implementation of the new system, half of the Australian rayon market and most of the cotton product market remain open to Japanese goods. Although the Australian government does not protest against the changes in tariffs on Australian goods by the Japanese government, the Australian government's decision on the new tariff structure is not aimed at Japanese goods. Therefore, it insists on the new structure from beginning to end, but if an effective solution can be obtained between the Australian government and the Japanese government, the Australian government also hopes for this solution.

<h3>U.S. Republican Party National Convention</h3>
<p>To Convene Today to Nominate Presidential Candidates</p>
<p>Cleveland. The Republican National Convention will convene here on Tuesday, hoping to unite the forces of the moderate faction of the party, formulate a party platform sufficient to appeal to the national public, and nominate presidential and vice-presidential candidates to engage in the general election on November 3. To achieve this goal, the biggest task of the Republican Party at present is to eliminate divergent opinions within the party and launch a united attack on the Democratic Party, which currently controls the White House and both houses of Congress. Therefore, the convention must be able to reconcile the views of the agricultural part of the Midwest with those of the financial and industrial parts. In recent months, the Republican Party has indeed made every effort to put forward a leader sufficient to appeal to the whole country as a presidential candidate, and to adjust the interests of agriculture and industry within the scope of not harming the government's financial and industrial policies. The Republicans in the East are more conservative, and those in the West are more liberal, but which should be the keynote should be decided by the convention. After the convention convenes on Tuesday, all important speeches will be broadcast across the country via radio. The first task will be to elect a temporary chairman, followed by welcome speeches. The standing organization will appear on the second day. In the evening, there may be speeches on policy to declare the party's hopes and guidance. At the same time, various proposals will be submitted. The platform committee will also begin work. Because there are many candidates for this election, the voting will take place at least on Thursday. If the first vote does not produce any results, a second vote will be taken. In the Democratic Party, a candidate must obtain a two-thirds majority to be elected, but in the Republican Party, an ordinary majority can be elected. The length of the session will depend on whether the initial vote can produce a presidential candidate. If Landon can win a majority of votes after one or two votes, the convention can be closed within one or two weeks. If Landon cannot be elected immediately, the meeting will be extended to wait for the presidential candidate to be nominated. (8th, Kuomin News Agency)</p>

<h3>Soviet Newspapers Warn Trotsky</h3>
<p>Bought by Foreign Money, Public Enemy of the Current Administration</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Communist Party's organ newspaper, Pravda, recently published an article warning the followers of the opposition leaders Trotsky and Zinoviev, and denouncing them as "public enemies of the current administration bought by foreign money." It is generally believed that this article has two implications: 1. The new Soviet Constitution will be submitted to the Soviet Congress for approval and implementation in the autumn of this year, and the Communist Party will eliminate the party again beforehand. 2. After the recent purge, there is a risk of resentment within the party, which is enough to threaten the unity of the party. The newspaper also said that all agencies affiliated with the Communist Party should pay attention, saying that "the public enemies of the current administration cannot be eliminated by purging and revoking party certificates. Middle-class secret agents can still be mixed among party members." (8th, Havas)</p>

In addition, the three heads of state also decided to adopt the same attitude as Britain and France on the Locarno case. On the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, the three countries will abide by the resolution of the League of Nations and do not intend to initiate anything.

<h3>Resolution of the French Labor Strike: Workers Achieve Complete Victory, Implementing a 40-Hour Workweek, with Wage Increases of 7 to 15 Percent; 600,000 Workers to Resume Work Imminently</h3>
<p>(Paris) French capitalists, under pressure from Prime Minister Blum, have succumbed to the nationwide labor strike and are willing to make concessions. At today's meeting between labor and management, chaired by Blum, the capitalists have agreed to adopt the following measures: widespread wage increases, recognition of labor unions, and permission for collective bargaining. The government is now quite optimistic that the strike movement can be halted by Monday or Tuesday. The workers' only remaining demand, paid holidays, has not yet been accepted. Blum has drafted a bill for a 40-hour workweek, which is likely to be passed by parliament before the end of next week. The issue of paid holidays has also been allowed to be submitted to parliament for discussion. Meanwhile, right-wing elements continue to attack Blum, calling him "the beginning of Jews ruling over the Gauls and Romans." The government has retaliated, seizing a special edition of the reactionary royalist newspaper "French United News" today, due to a scathing article opposing the government. The publisher and editor may also be prosecuted. (National Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the resolution of the labor strike, representatives from the United General Confederation of Labor and the Employers' Federation met for five hours yesterday afternoon, continuing into the night until 1:00 AM this morning, when they signed an agreement. The agreement stipulates the following points: Regarding the right of workers to join labor unions; Regarding the right of workers in various factories and workshops to elect representatives (to liaise with employers on all matters); Regarding the conditions for resuming work in various factories; Regarding the implementation of a 40-hour workweek; Regarding the method of paying wages for one week of annual vacation; Regarding the signing of work contracts by union representatives on behalf of workers with employers. As for wage increases, it is stipulated that senior employees will receive a 7% increase, and junior employees will receive a 15% increase. In addition, factory owners will not pursue any action against striking workers. Although this agreement still needs to be approved separately by local and industry-specific labor unions, factories should resume work as soon as preparations are complete. Interior Minister Salengro, after the signing of the agreement, made a statement to the press, saying, in brief, that approximately 300,000 people joined the strike in the north and 250,000 in the capital. Now that mediation has been successful, the labor strike can be completely ended within 48 hours, which is truly gratifying. The General Confederation of Labor Secretary-General Stone is also satisfied with the end of the labor strike. However, department stores have not joined the Employers' Federation, so the agreement established last night does not include that industry. Interior Minister Salengro has scheduled a meeting this afternoon at the ministry, convening labor and management from that industry to discuss solutions to the disputes, in order to sign a separate agreement. (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Representatives from the United General Confederation of Labor and the Employers' Federation signed an agreement last night, bringing the ten-day-long labor strike to an end. Additional details on yesterday's events are provided below:</p>
<p>Earlier, Prime Minister Léon Blum, yesterday morning, requested that the United General Confederation of Labor and the Employers' Federation each send representatives to immediately begin negotiations to seek conditions for resuming work. Both parties accepted. In the afternoon, negotiations were held at the Ministry of the Interior, chaired by Prime Minister Léon Blum and Interior Minister Salengro. Representing the employers were Dusemin, Chairman of the French Industrial Federation, Liepu, Secretary-General of the Iron Industry Association, the Chairman of the Metallurgical Industry Association, and the Chairman of the Paris Chamber of Commerce. Representing the General Confederation of Labor was Secretary-General Stone and three union representatives. Prior to this, the employers had, in principle, agreed to the two demands made by the labor side: determining the minimum wage and having the work contract signed by the labor union. By 6:00 PM, the negotiations ended. Interior Minister Salengro made a statement to reporters, saying in brief, "A solution to the labor strike has been discussed. However, the representatives of both labor and management must consult with the respective groups they represent. Therefore, the details cannot be released at this time, in order to avoid hindering the progress of negotiations. But I dare to believe that when the representatives of both parties resume negotiations at 11:30 PM, an agreement can be signed, and the labor strikes in various industries will all come to an end." At the same time, the Standing Committee of the United General Confederation of Labor also held a meeting. After the meeting, Secretary-General Stone made a statement to reporters, saying, "After the representatives of labor and management held negotiations at the Ministry of the Interior in the afternoon, a compromise has been reached in principle. However, the representatives of both parties still need to seek the consent of the groups they represent. This was accepted at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the General Confederation of Labor just now. Therefore, both parties should be willing to sign an agreement, as we hope." By 11:30 PM last night, labor and management continued their meeting at the Ministry of the Interior, and an agreement was signed immediately. It was already midnight. (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The labor strike situation improved greatly yesterday. After the Employers' Federation and the United General Confederation of Labor signed an agreement last night, it improved even more. Today is the thirteenth day since the outbreak of the labor strike. Looking at the situation in the capital, the saying of improvement has been clearly confirmed. From this morning, the supply of food for the people has been continuous, no different from normal days. Various public utilities, such as buses, trams, subways, and taxis, have all resumed normal operation. There are no strikes in the banks. Because the Hachette newspaper delivery company has not yet resumed work, the newspapers are temporarily being distributed by the newspaper offices to subscribers in the capital and provinces. However, the labor and management of the delivery company should reach a compromise by tomorrow morning. In several buildings and shops, there are still a small number of workers who have stopped working. As for the metallurgical industry, the strike situation in most factories will not improve until this afternoon. For example, the workers of the Landot and Citroën automobile factories are still occupying the factories and refusing to leave. However, both labor and management believe that the dispute can be resolved, so as to resume work as soon as possible. (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The sit-down strike movement, involving more than 500,000 workers, has now reached a resolution through negotiations between representatives of labor and management at midnight. The representatives of both parties met in the office of the new Prime Minister Blum, with Blum mediating. From yesterday afternoon until late at night, a partial compromise was reached on three points: wage increases, recognition of labor unions, and recognition of factory committees. The employers' representatives insisted that the strikers should immediately return to work, but it was not until midnight that the labor representatives agreed to end the strike after the workers had consulted among themselves. However, the Paris construction industry, without waiting for the results of the labor-management meeting, has decided to strike today. The labor strike resolution agreement stipulates wage increases ranging from 7 to 15 percent, a 40-hour workweek, paid holidays, and collective contracts. It is now expected that the strike will be calmed down within 48 hours. The new government's efforts to mediate the labor strike are seen by the public as a victory for Blum, as Blum took on the arduous task in the first hour of his term. Last night, the Interior Minister announced that the number of strikers was 300,000 in Paris and 250,000 in the northern provinces. It is said that the employers' representatives were forced to make concessions to the labor representatives and accept the labor side's conditions because the new government decided that if a settlement could not be reached, the authorities would intervene. However, because these conditions have economic consequences, they are subject to reservations. The agreement does not apply to large department stores, because these stores have not joined the Employers' Federation. However, the owners and employees of these stores will meet under the supervision of the Interior Minister in the afternoon to resolve their disputes. The new Prime Minister Blum told a Reuters reporter today that he was extremely satisfied with the outcome of the meeting. Labor representative Yoyou also told a Reuters reporter that the agreement reached this time has fulfilled the long-cherished wishes of the workers and has put France on the path to a new economic system. When the House of Representatives meets tomorrow, the government will propose the necessary bills to complete the resolution of the labor strike. (Reuters Dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3>Guangdong Province's Second-Phase Plan Awaiting Review, Approval, and Implementation; Implementation Scheduled to Begin Next Month; Construction Department Submits Entire Plan; Factory Component Expands Existing Facilities</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondent: The agencies under the Guangdong Provincial Government have sequentially drafted and submitted the province's second three-year plan. About 70% to 80% of the items have been collected and can be completed within the month. A preliminary summary review will begin. The heads of the Civil Affairs, Finance, Construction, and Education Departments will take the opportunity to jointly inspect the counties in the central region to understand the situation and use it as a basis for conducting group reviews of the plans of each department. This is the most recent change in the procedures for drafting, reviewing, and deciding on the second three-year plan by the provincial government. It has been determined that the joint inspection of the four department heads should be conducted in March, April, May, and June of this year to review and improve the initial three-year plan, assess its administrative achievements, and lay the groundwork for drafting the second-phase plan. However, due to government affairs, the department heads could not spend too much time on inspection. Therefore, it was proposed to conduct the joint inspection of the central region as early as possible. Suddenly, Mr. Hu passed away in Guangzhou, and the trip had to be suspended. Subsequently, representatives from the Central Government arrived in Guangdong to mourn Hu's passing and discuss important matters related to the party and the country. For these reasons, the four department heads and Chairman Lin delayed the inspection of past administrative plans and the progress of drafting the second-phase plan. It has recently been learned that the department heads have decided on the inspection dates again and have tentatively scheduled the inspection itinerary. Provincial Government Chairman Lin Yizhong will still travel to the southern route via the Wuyi area. The three department heads, Qu Fangpu, Huang Linshu, and He Qihong, will jointly inspect the central region. Chairman Lin stated that the 25th year will begin in July, and the province's second three-year plan will be implemented from the 25th year. There is only one month left for preparation, which is urgent. The second-phase plans of the civil affairs, finance, and education departments and other agencies have been drafted and submitted to the provincial government. Only the construction department has not submitted concrete plans, which not only affects the preliminary review work but also has a bearing on the group review and overall decision. Therefore, Construction Department Head He Qihong was ordered to draft and submit the plans to the provincial government for review to revive the economy. As for the provincial government's factories that generate private economic income, the focus is on reorganization, improvement, and increasing production. Constructions that have no major relationship to the national economy will not be included in the plan. The expansion plans for the various provincial government factories are divided into three aspects: output, funds, and management.</p>
<p>- The managers of the provincial government factories are only responsible for planning to increase production and improving the machinery and procedures in the factory.</p>
<p>- The marketing of the products is the sole responsibility of the Provincial Government Product Management Office.</p>
<p>- All income and expenditure of the various factories are managed by the Provincial Government Factory Audit Committee, which will properly use the surplus funds as a reserve for expanding the factories.</p>
<h3>Japanese People's Active Conspiracy in Inner Mongolia: Aiming for a Grand Encirclement of the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia</h3>
<p>Since realizing its ambition to annex Manchuria, Japanese imperialism has been eyeing the vast, boundless plains of Siberia. This area is a treasure trove yet to be developed, possessing abundant mineral resources such as coal, iron, and petroleum, all essential resources for national defense. Resource-poor Japan believes that if it can occupy this territory, it can establish an unshakable foundation for dominating East and West Asia. However, Japan's ambition cannot be achieved as easily as the Manchurian Incident, with a simple wave of the hand and a satisfactory success. Since the September 18th Incident, the Soviet Union has stationed over 300,000 elite Red Army troops in its vast territories along the Far Eastern border and has actively strengthened various military facilities, preparing to deliver a head-on blow to invaders. Therefore, Japan dares not act rashly to achieve its goals and must make further preparations in its military deployment. Taking advantage of Inner Mongolia is one of these preparations. It wants to establish a second puppet state in the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan, advance westward to seize Ningxia, and form a grand encirclement of the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia, with the aim of invading Outer Mongolia and cutting off the Siberian Railway, attacking Chita, Ulan-Ude, Irkutsk, and other places. Japan's plan to seize Inner Mongolia began after annexing the four northeastern provinces.</p>
<p>At that time, it changed the three leagues of Jerim, Jorosutu, and Jouda into the puppet Xing'an Province, which was a preparation for establishing a puppet Mongolian state in the future. Its methods of operation are twofold: on the one hand, to appease the feudal rulers, and on the other hand, to use traitors to exert pressure. In the past four years, the activities of the Japanese in Bailingmiao, Pangjiang, and Zhangjiakou have all been like this. And the puppet troops such as Li Shou-hsin and Zhuo Shi-hai are rampant in eastern Chahar, and they are plotting to annex the two provinces sooner or later. Now we can point out all the conspiracies and facilities of the Japanese and traitorous puppet troops to remind the people of the country to pay attention. The first is the activity of the puppet troops. Since Li Shou-hsin and Zhuo Shi-hai's puppet troops occupied the six counties of Guyuan, Baochang, Zhangbei, Shangdu, Kangbao, and Huade in eastern Chahar, they have established two military academies in Zhangbei, recruiting a large number of Mongolian youths for training. At the same time, they also took advantage of the serious Mongolian disaster last winter to recruit soldiers on a large scale and expand their strength. Recently, they have further maintained contact with Zhang Hai-peng's puppet troops on the Rehe border and scattered bandits, deciding to take military action to the west. When possible, they will invade Guihua to the south, hoping to complete the first step in encircling Outer Mongolia and the Soviet Union within the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan.</p>
<p>Secondly, in order to cover up the activities of the puppet troops, the Japanese have sent an air force team of twenty aircraft from outside the Guan, stationed in Zhangbei, Pangjiang, and Bailingmiao, and have opened up a large airfield there. At the same time, wireless radio stations have been set up in Suiyuan, Baotou, and Ningxia to communicate with each other. The third is the anesthetizing work in culture. Now the Japanese have established so-called goodwill associations and good neighbor associations in important places such as Pangjiang, Bailingmiao, and Baotou. The work done by these groups is mostly about charity on the surface, such as free medical treatment and poverty relief, etc. In reality, it is a propaganda machine. They have sent many young Japanese people to organize mobile medical teams to provide free medical treatment in various places, taking the opportunity to spread their absurd theories of Mongolian autonomy. At the same time, they have also established many small schools to implement enslaving education. Geographically speaking, the entire Inner Mongolia is a barrier in the northwest of our country. Now the Japanese are deliberately planning to plunder this land of national defense outposts, which can be used as a base for further encroaching on the Central Plains. Its seriousness is truly no less than that of North China. The people of the country really should not ignore it! (China United News Agency)</p>
<h3>Nanking City: Land Registration Situation - Achievements After the Restoration of the Land Bureau - The City-wide General Registration Will Soon Be Completed</h3>
<p>Nanking Correspondence: The Nanking Municipal Government, in order to expedite the city-wide general land registration, restored the Land Bureau last July. Since its establishment on July 20 last year, the bureau has made unremitting efforts in land administration. Now the city-wide general registration is about to be completed. In order to clarify the land administration situation in the Nanking City, the work of the City Land Bureau since its establishment is specially explored and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Registration Situation</p>
<p>Land registration in Nanking City began in July 1934. Although the Land Law had been promulgated at that time, it had not yet been implemented. The municipal government separately formulated the "Provisional Rules for Land Registration in Nanking City" as a guideline for handling matters. The city, Xiaguan, and Pukou, etc., which have been surveyed and cleared, are divided into eight registration districts, and registration applications are requested by district within a time limit. The Land Registration Office of the Finance Bureau is responsible for land registration matters. As of June last year, the deadline for registration applications in the first to sixth districts of the city had all expired. A total of 19,745 ownership registration cases were received, and a total of 2,017 cases were approved for registration. When the Land Bureau was established in July last year, it continued to handle the registration cases in the first to sixth districts, and started land registration in the seventh and eighth districts on September 1 last year, and shortened the application deadline to 40 days. After the deadline, it was found that there were still a large number of business owners in each area who had not registered. If penalties were imposed in accordance with the regulations, or their land was disposed of, citizens would suffer many losses. In order to show consideration for business owners and complete the registration, the government changed the deadline for registration in each district to the end of December 1935, and formulated a presumed registration method. For land that is not registered after the deadline, the Land Bureau will presume registration as ownerless land. If no one claims an objection after the announcement period expires, the bureau will presume to take over the land. After one year, it will be officially taken over as city land. This method, on the one hand, promotes the completion of registration, and on the other hand, still gives citizens the opportunity to restore ownership. As of May 23 this year, the Land Bureau has received a total of 17,429 ownership registration cases and 7,038 other property rights registration cases. The handling of registration cases is statistically listed by district and by month as follows:</p>
<p>Table 1: Statistics on Ownership Registration Cases Handled as of May 23, 1936</p>
<p>"Note" The total number of cases received in the table is 17,429. In addition to the 22,629 cases that have been approved for announcement, there are still 4,800 cases in backlog, including 70 cases that were mistakenly reported for registration outside the scope of the registration district, 150 cases that were suspended from registration within the scope of the political district requisition, 212 cases where property rights disputes have occurred and lawsuits have been filed in court, and registration has been suspended, and 559 cases where duplicate applications and other property rights were mistakenly reported as ownership registration and have been revoked. The above items total 991 cases, so the actual number of ownership registration cases being processed as of May 23 this year is 3,809.</p>
<p>Table 2: Monthly Statistics of Land Registration Cases Handled by the Nanking City Land Bureau (from July 24, 1935 to May 23, 1936)</p>
<p>Registration Procedure</p>
<p>Nanking used to be an important place in Jiangnan and has suffered many wars. Most of the property deeds of the people have been lost. Although several supplements were made at the end of the Qing Dynasty and the beginning of the Republic of China, they were not thoroughly organized, but instead caused more chaos. According to the statistics, there are dozens of types of deeds and certificates found in Nanking City, including those from the Post-War Rehabilitation Bureau, the Agricultural Encouragement Bureau, the Land Reclamation Bureau, the Qing Text Bureau, the Palace Property Bureau, the Commercial Port Bureau, the Camp Property Office, the Police Department, the Military Governor's Office, various municipal bureaus, and other military and political organs, Jiangning Prefecture, Shangyuan County, Jiangning County, and the county finance bureaus and other organs' printed contracts, pawn contracts, as well as new contracts, verification contracts, official contracts, white contracts, verification forms, survey forms, receipts, package agreements, etc. The location, household name, area, and four boundaries of the land recorded are also extremely simple and vague, and the property rights are extremely difficult to determine. Often, there is only one piece of land, and it is bought and sold repeatedly, and there are as many as forty or fifty deeds and certificates. The sizes, lengths, widths, and forms are not uniform, and the heads and tails of the contracts are attached to each other, and they are divided, cut, and continued to be white, broken and fragmented. Insinuations and forgeries make it even more difficult to identify. The purpose of land registration is to organize land. In order to carefully protect property rights, the City Land Bureau strives for detailed procedures. All registration cases should first be filled out by the owner in an application form, and the contract and certificate should be submitted for registration. After checking the base map, investigating the use of the surrounding areas, reviewing the area and houses, and measuring and preparing the review map, the review can begin after all kinds of procedures. During the review, the household name, location, four boundaries, area, surrounding land conditions, rights and interests, and the authenticity and completeness of the documents must be strictly checked. If any doubts arise, investigation, inquiry, or other methods must be used to accurately determine the truth of the property rights. After the review is determined, it will be announced. After the three-month period expires, if no objection is raised, the ownership map will be prepared, sent to the court for printing, and then notified to collect it. Therefore, each registration case takes an average of six months to complete after this cumbersome procedure and approve the registration. If the registration process is hindered because the applicant and interested parties cannot be summoned, or because the relevant documents cannot be verified, the registration process will inevitably be hindered. If a property rights dispute occurs, the review can only be carried out after the court makes a judgment, and the registration will inevitably be delayed. This is the ordinary registration procedure for registration cases.</p>
<p>Registration Fee and Penalties</p>
<p>The registration fee for land registration in Nanking City is collected in accordance with the provisions of the revised "Provisional Rules for Land Registration in Nanking City." It is calculated that for the first ownership registration, a fee of two per thousand is charged according to the declared price or occupancy price. For registration of the acquisition, establishment, transfer, or change of land rights, a fee of one per thousand is charged according to the selling price or the value of the rights. In addition, the book fee is charged for each sheet according to the value of land rights as follows: less than 100 yuan is 20 cents, 100 yuan or more is 50 cents, 500 yuan or more is 1 yuan, 1,000 yuan or more is 2 yuan, 5,000 yuan or more is 5 yuan, 10,000 yuan or more is 10 yuan. As for the registration penalties, it is stipulated that if a land rights holder or obligor requests registration after the registration deadline, an additional registration fee of 4/10 of the fee will be levied for every 15 days overdue. In addition, the presumed registration will be held from 1936, and it is stipulated that those who are approved to make up the registration after the presumed registration is announced shall pay a fine of 5/1000 of the registered property price. The above registration fees and the fees charged for overdue registration, as well as the fines for making up the registration, are all collected by the Land Bureau and submitted to the municipal treasury on a daily basis. It is found that from July 1935 to the end of April 1936, the bureau collected a total of 38,388.02 yuan in registration fees and 95.68 yuan in penalties for overdue registration.</p>
<p>Organization and Expenses</p>
<p>The Nanking City Land Bureau has three sections: the first, second, and third sections. The first section has three groups: general affairs, registration, and land acreage. The second section has a survey group and seven review groups. The third section has two groups: surveying and mapping, and a labor examination group. The surveying group has eight surveying teams. This is a general overview of the bureau's original organizational structure. However, this year, the bureau was ordered to be renamed the Land Administration Bureau, and the organizational rules have been revised. Except for the first and third sections, the second section has added a land tax group to handle land tax matters starting next year. The source of funds for the Land Bureau is provided by the municipal treasury. The bureau's 1935 budget includes 371,568 yuan for recurring expenses and 360,000 yuan for temporary expenses, totaling 751,568 yuan. The amount of temporary expenses is relatively large because the general registration is being actively expedited this year, and the organization and business have expanded, so the temporary expenses have been appropriately increased. The purpose of these temporary expenses is to expedite registration, increase the salaries of staff, office expenses, and purchase surveying instruments. In addition to the fixed monthly payment of salaries and office expenses, the purchase expenses must be submitted to the municipal government for approval when needed. Therefore, the actual temporary expenses paid by the bureau each month are about 8,700 yuan in July 1935 (including start-up expenses), more than 32,000 yuan in August (including the purchase of vehicles, instruments, clothing, and furniture), and an average of about 18,000 yuan per month from September to April 1936, which is about 60% of the budget. This is a general overview of the bureau's expenses.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Farmers in the Suzhou Countryside are Causing Trouble Again</h3>
<p>Farmers in Chefang, Xietang and other villages in the Suzhou countryside have continuously engaged in disturbances over rent. The county government, considering that the collection of rent by various firms was not prosperous, ordered the county to collect 50%, while the land tax collection was only about 70%. Therefore, it will set up a mobile grain collection point in Xietang Township within a few days. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 6th, farmers in Yangmu and Shigang and other places in Xietang Township gathered to cause trouble. After the security team rushed to suppress them, the situation was quickly calmed down. At that time, the farmers who resisted the rent and caused trouble, Hu Shengyuan and others, were arrested and sent to the public security branch for verification. On the morning of the 7th, at about 8:00, about 200 farmers were found gathering in a dilapidated temple in the Duixu area, intending to petition. They were also dispersed by the security team. At about 2:00 in the afternoon of the same day, more than 400 farmers from Lianmu Village and other places took more than a dozen farm boats to the home of Zhao Buqing, a Baowu chief in Xiepo Village, and destroyed the furniture and objects before dispersing. Nie Dezhao, the captain of the security brigade, reported the previous situation and immediately went to the countryside, convened a meeting of the villagers, and persuaded them to do everything. It is said that on the evening of the same day, more than 100 farmers in Jinmiao Township also plotted to cause trouble over rent, but they did not dare to take any action due to the strict defense of the police team. The official department has no fundamental solution to this problem.</p>
<h3>Husband Chops and Injures Adulterous Couple</h3>
<p>Shen Genshi, a farmer in Xiexing Village, Muqiao Township, discovered that his wife, Xie Jinying, was having an affair with Zhang Quanlin, a villager. At about 4:00 p.m. on the 7th, Shen Yao was out selling silk and returned home. After entering the door, he saw his wife, Xie, and Zhang Quanlin sleeping on the same bed. So, he angrily obtained a kitchen knife and chopped Xie's head several times. Zhang Quanlin, the adulterer, was also chopped several times. After the two were injured, they fell to the ground and could not move. The incident was heard by the neighbors and reported to the fifth branch of the public security bureau, which dispatched the police to arrest Shen Genshi and send him to the branch. At the same time, the injured people were sent to the hospital for treatment. Zhang Quanlin's injuries were quite serious and his life was in danger. On the 8th, the county branch sent Shen Genshi to the public security bureau and then to the district procuratorate for interrogation. It is said that Shen Genshi confessed to the public security bureau that he committed the crime out of anger. Shen Xie also confessed that she had an affair with Zhang Quanlin.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Bumper Fresh Cocoon Harvest</h3>
<p>The cocoon firms in the four villages of the county have already started weighing. The volume of goods received on the third day was more enthusiastic than on the first day. Because the farmers were eager to use the money, they had to sell their cocoons at a low price. On the 8th, the volume of goods received by the cocoon firms in the urban area was not prosperous due to the rainy weather. The price of cocoons was 35 yuan higher. The volume of goods received by the cocoon firms in rural areas such as Houtai, Zhi Banqiao, Lishe, Zhangcun, Ludianqiao, Xiajiabian, Huangtutang, Jilangbang, Qingqi, Zhaqiao, Helukou, Shitouwan, Beifangquan, and Kuopu was very large. Each firm could receive one or two hundred loads of goods every day. The price of cocoons was 37 yuan higher, and the price of silk was 35 yuan per load. However, wealthy households generally bake fresh cocoons into dried cocoons and wait for a good price to sell them.</p>
<h3>Small Loans for Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>The head office of Jiangsu Bank, regarding the case of providing small loans for industry and commerce, has been instructed by the Jiangsu Provincial Government to approve the case and requested the Jiangsu Higher Court to order the county governments to inform the chambers of commerce in the counties and cities to assist in the handling. The branches and offices of the bank, in addition to the two special municipalities of Shanghai and Nanjing, have the following branches and offices in the counties of the province: (branches) Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Wuxian, Nantong, Changshu, (sub-branches) Wujin, Tongshan, Taixian, Taixing, Donghai, Huaiyin, (offices) Haimen, Qidong, Jingjiang, Jiangpu, Jiangdu, Zhuanyou, Yizheng, Huaian, Xiaoxian, Dangshan, Siyang, etc., a total of 21 places. In order to facilitate management, the head office intends to instruct the branch offices to be responsible for the pilot implementation. If the implementation is successful, it will be gradually promoted. In order to carefully account for the loans, it has specially written to the chambers of commerce to organize a review committee to introduce small loans for industry and commerce. However, the amount of the loan shall not exceed 1,000 yuan of the national currency, and the term shall not exceed four months. Those who breach the contract and fail to repay shall be subject to administrative and legal sanctions by the local government. Merchants or factories that have not joined the same industry association shall not be allowed to apply for loans.</p>
<h3>Yangfu Highway to be Completed</h3>
<p>The Yangfu Highway between Yangjian Town in this county and Fushan Town in Changshu County was started last month. The earthwork project has been largely completed, and the road surface is now being paved with gravel and cinder. It is expected to be completed by the end of this month. The issue of future traffic will still be handled by the Xihu Company.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Market Conditions After Cocoon Firms Open</h3>
<p>A total of 87 cocoon firms have registered and reported to be open in the city and rural areas of Wuyi this year. The opening date was decided by the Cocoon Association to be June 8. However, the cocoon harvest in the southeast villages was earlier, so the cocoon firms in Donghenglin, Weishuyan, Tangqiao, Banshang, Xianjiaqiao, and Chenduqiao and other towns opened successively on June 7 to collect cocoons. The quality of the improved silkworm cocoons is very good. Although the arrival of goods is not very crowded, the price of cocoons has exceeded the expected price. The price of improved silkworm cocoons on the city scale is 35-6 yuan higher per load, and the price of native cocoons is 25-6 yuan. The cocoon harvest in the northwest villages is also started on the 7th, but the arrival of goods is very scarce. From about the 8th, the county's cocoon firms will be in a peak harvest period, and the people are all overjoyed after the price has increased.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Deadline for Canal Dredging Order from the Department</h3>
<p>The Jiangdu County Government, because it had previously received an order from the Construction Department to issue this year's measures for conscripting labor to dredge rivers in various counties, had already transferred the order to the district offices with dredging relations for consultation and handling. Now that the year is coming to an end, it has continued to receive an order from the Construction Department, instructing to complete the dredged rivers by the end of this month, and those that have not been completed shall be rushed to completion by June 15, and reported to the Department for statistics. The order was transferred to the dredging district chiefs on the 6th to comply with.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Investigating Smuggling Along the River and Sea</h3>
<p>In the coastal areas of the Nantong jurisdiction, there have been frequent cases of treacherous people colluding with Japanese and Korean vagrants to transport smuggled goods in sand boats and unload them from remote ports. The Nantong District Commissioner's Office has ordered the police of the county's water and land public security teams to strictly investigate and crack down on smuggling. The coastal areas are the responsibility of the water public security teams of the three districts.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Cocoon Firms Stop Weighing Separately</h3>
<p>There are more than 50 cocoon firms in Jiaxing this year. The cocoon firms that collect native cocoons have already stopped weighing. The cocoon firms that buy improved silkworm cocoons have been open for nine days. Most of them have started weighing on rest days. Because the goods were crowded this year, the number of each cocoon firm exceeded the original registered amount. Because the cocoon collection time has been extended, after the suppliers stopped weighing, there are still a large number of fresh cocoons in the countryside that are still required to be collected, resulting in disputes. Fortunately, the Weicheng Textile Factory is still buying cocoons, and the nearby villagers mostly carried them to sell, while the villagers in remote areas felt very inconvenient. Therefore, local people telegraphed the Cocoon Collection Committee to find a way to provide relief, but it is unknown how to handle it.</p>
<h3>Cixi: Interviewers of the Local History Museum</h3>
<p>The Cixi County History has been around for many years. In February, the county government convened people from various villages and decided to revise it. Yang Sheng was publicly elected as the curator, and Chen Qihuai was the editor-in-chief. The items and interview regulations of the county history were stipulated, and interviewers were assigned to each village to conduct interviews. It should be completed within this year and start editing. If there are any important facts that are not included in the old history or that are difficult to interview, you can contact the interviewers in each district nearby. The interviewers in each district are: City District She Zhengyi, Feng Jingjiang, Dongxiang Hong Zuohu, Nanxiang Xiao Xiangfan, Yan Zijing, Xixiang (resigned) Hu Jingyuan, Ye Raobo, Beixiang Shen Xiaoting, Shen Bingren.</p>
<h3>Letter from Lawyer Tang Shenfang</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, in the Suzhou section of your newspaper on May 29, there was a report about Li Yaoyuan abandoning his concubine and filing another lawsuit. I am the agent for the previous case. I immediately went to the Wujiang Local Court for investigation and found no such case, nor did I hear about any mediation outside the court. I am sending this letter for correction. I hope you will appreciate it. Sincerely, Lawyer Tang Shenfang.</p>

<h3>Employees of Various Industries Report Smuggling Jointly - Telegram to the Whole Country for Consistent Reporting - This City Started Working Yesterday - Eight Reporting Measures Set</h3>
<p>The Joint Smuggling Reporting Committee of Employees of Various Industries has been actively proceeding with the smuggling reporting work since its establishment, and has set eight reporting measures, and telegrammed them to employees of various industries across the country for consistent implementation. Here is a detailed report by the Dagong Society reporter:</p>
<p>Start Reporting</p>
<p>The Smuggling Reporting Committee of Employees of Various Industries in this city has decided to start smuggling reporting work from yesterday after its establishment. All employees of various industries in this city can contact the committee for reporting smuggled goods. The office is temporarily located at No. 545, Erma Road, Shanghai Workers' Society, and the first committee meeting will be held on the 13th of this month to discuss various important matters. Employees from various places are also enthusiastically reporting to the committee to participate.</p>
<p>Reporting Measures The committee will assist the government in reporting smuggling. If smuggled goods are found, no matter how much, they should be reported immediately. After discovering smuggled goods, employees should report them to the committee in writing or verbally. However, the reporter must provide their name and address, but the committee will absolutely keep their identity secret. If the reported smuggled goods do not match the facts, the committee will impose sanctions. The reporter should fill in the detailed information of the merchant factory and the person in charge of transporting the smuggled goods. After receiving the report, the committee will send staff to secretly investigate and report it to the competent authority for handling. If the smuggled goods were not detected when they were transported in, or until they were disguised and impersonated as domestic goods or other foreign goods for sale, the trademark that was replaced, the smuggled goods, and the standards for distinguishing them from other goods should be sent to the committee together. The committee will send staff to investigate, or ask experts to inspect, and then report it to the competent authority for handling. The committee will give nominal rewards to employees who report smuggling to encourage patriots. If there are special merits in reporting, it will be reported to the competent authority for material rewards. If employees who report smuggling are suspended or otherwise harmed by the store or factory, the committee will resolutely protect them and petition the competent authority to protect them, so that the reporting employees will not suffer any spiritual or material losses. If the staff sent by the committee to investigate smuggling collude with the other party who is transporting smuggled goods, cover up the truth, or take bribes to let them go, or fabricate reports, they will be paraded through the streets or reported to the competent authority to be held liable for instigating the crime and the crime of accomplice. These measures will be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Whole Country</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Employees Smuggling Reporting Committee telegraphed the whole country, saying: (Title omitted) Since Japanese and Korean vagrants smuggled goods in North China, the loss of customs revenue has reached more than 100 million yuan. The damage to the country's vitality and the shaking of the national economy are becoming increasingly serious. Our people are in this bad environment, and we are truly heartbroken. A group of traitors who have lost their conscience and act as accomplices, taking advantage of the protection of foreign slaves, and being blinded by profits, are transporting a large number of smuggled goods, which are really the moths of the country and the enemies of the nation. Our employees are members of the nation. Loving the country and the nation is our bounden duty. We cannot remain silent and allow them to be rampant. The employees of various industries in Shanghai have established the Smuggling Reporting Committee on this day and will announce the reporting measures on Geng day to start the reporting work. Our employees should stand on the front line of saving the nation and eradicating evil, not seeking merit, but wishing to have no fault. This heart and this purpose shine like the sky. I urge my employees across the country to take the same steps, implement them immediately, assist the government, and eliminate the scourge. We will fight a death match against treacherous merchants who transport smuggled goods. This is a small wish, and I hope you will understand.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Establishment: Fish Industry Smuggling Inspection Committee Issues Declaration Urging Attention from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Smuggling in North China is becoming increasingly serious, and various smuggled goods are spreading throughout Shanghai. Although the government has strictly formulated anti-smuggling measures and implemented them vigorously, a general group of unscrupulous people still drink poison to quench their thirst and have no scruples. Jin Chuxiang, in view of this situation, in order to strengthen the organization of the fish industry and assist the government in intensifying anti-smuggling efforts, specially joined forces with key figures in the industry to form the Shanghai Fish Industry Smuggling Inspection Committee, which began inspection work yesterday. At the same time, a declaration was issued to urge attention from all sectors. The declaration stated, "Japan, under the pretext of the Boxer Protocol and the Tanggu Truce, has increased its troops in North China and sheltered smuggling. Although our government has repeatedly negotiated, it has been ineffective due to Japan's tough attitude. Recently, the smuggling trend has spread throughout the country. If it is not quickly eradicated, the impact will not only cause endless losses to the national treasury, but also the weak domestic industry and commerce will be completely destroyed. The national economy will inevitably collapse. Looking at the future, we cannot help but shudder. Now the government has promulgated measures to prevent smuggling by road transport, interim regulations for punishing tax evasion, and interim regulations for inspecting the import and sale of goods, and has issued orders to various places to strictly implement them. If local industries and businesses can all uphold their patriotic sincerity and deeply feel the pain, and agree to refrain from purchasing and selling smuggled goods, then by supporting each other from top to bottom, smuggling will naturally be eradicated. However, people's hearts are not as they used to be, and unscrupulous merchants are emerging one after another. Chuxiang and others, speaking about fish in terms of fish, based on past experience in cracking down on unscrupulous merchants colluding with foreigners to encroach on fishing rights, believe that in order to thoroughly eliminate smuggled goods, it is essential for enthusiastic patriots or legitimate merchants in various industries to form strict organizations and conduct their own inspections. Therefore, based on this principle, the Fish Industry Smuggling Inspection Committee was organized, and work began immediately. From now on, regardless of whether they are in the same industry or not, if any smuggling of fish products is discovered, they will be reported according to the law and severely punished. We hope that all sectors will be aware of this. This declaration is hereby issued."</p>
<h3>Eurasia Aviation Corporation Plans to Open Yunnan-Guizhou Air Route; He En Scheduled to Go for Inspection</h3>
<p>The East China News Agency reports that since the Eurasia Aviation Corporation officially launched the Shaanxi-Yunnan route on April 1st, business has been extremely prosperous. In order to facilitate transportation from Kunming to Guiyang and Zhuxian, the Ministry of Communications has ordered the company to plan the Yunnan-Guizhou air route. Mr. Li Jingcong, General Manager of the company, considering the unpredictable weather around Guiyang and Zhuxian, and for the safety of passengers, has specially requested the Ministry of Communications for a two-month grace period to allow personnel to conduct on-site inspections before dispatching aircraft for test flights and scheduling the opening of the route. The Ministry has approved this request. According to sources, the company will dispatch He En, head of the flight crew, on the 20th of this month to conduct the inspection. Once he returns to Shanghai, he will report the inspection results to General Manager Li. If it is deemed feasible to open the route, aircraft will be dispatched for test flights immediately. If the test flight results are good, then a regular flight schedule will be officially announced.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Beiping Air Route to Take Effect Today; Changes to Round-Trip Flights on the Same Day</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Communications Sends Personnel to Investigate; Jardine Matheson Disrupts Shipping Rights; National and Private Shipping Companies Resist on Reasonable Grounds; Gansu Ship to Sail to Lianyungang for Its Maiden Voyage</h3>
<p>Since the British company Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. suspended operations of its original ships due to sluggish business on the Northern Lines and switched to the Lianyungang Line of the Longhai Railway, the Gansu ship has already made its maiden voyage on the 7th. National and private shipping companies in Shanghai have resisted on reasonable grounds. After the Ministry of Communications sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate, it immediately consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest to the company. The following is an account of the situation obtained by a reporter from the Ta Kung Pao:</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson's Gansu to Begin Regular Sailing</p>
<p>The Chengdu, Zhejiang, Gansu, Chongqing, and other ships of the British Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., which operate on the Northern Lines, have suspended service at the beginning of this month due to the large number of commercial ships operating on the lines and sluggish business. They will switch to the Lianyungang Line of the Longhai Railway. The Gansu ship, with a load of 2,000 tons, is scheduled to load passengers and cargo in Shanghai on the 15th of this month and officially set sail for the port. By the end of this month, all the Chengdu, Zhejiang, and Chongqing ships will also be added to the line.</p>
<p>National and Private Companies Resist on Reasonable Grounds</p>
<p>Since learning that Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. is opening the Lianyungang shipping line, national-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and privately-run Da Zhen, Hezhong and other shipping companies in Shanghai not only believe it will affect their business, but also disrupt China's shipping rights. They have telegraphed the Ministry of Communications to protest on reasonable grounds. The private sector has also petitioned the Shanghai Shipping Guild to submit a request to the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, which will then forward it to the Ministry of Communications for serious negotiations in order to safeguard shipping merchants and protect sovereignty. The guild also plans to convene a meeting within days to discuss effective countermeasures.</p>
<p>Ministry of Communications Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Investigate</p>
<p>Yesterday, inquiries were made to the local transportation authorities. After receiving telegrams from various parties requesting to stop the British Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. from opening the Lianyungang shipping line, the Ministry of Communications, in order to clarify the facts and strive for a solution, will send personnel to Shanghai within days to conduct an investigation. After the investigation, it will decide to consult the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest with the British Embassy in order to achieve the goal of safeguarding China's maritime administrative sovereignty.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Replies to Chamber of Commerce Regarding Protests Against Increased Troops and Smuggling</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday: "To the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, your telegram regarding the Japanese increase of troops in North China and the smuggling activities of Japanese and Korean people has been noted. This Ministry has repeatedly protested to the Japanese side, demanding that they stop increasing troops in China and strictly crack down on Japanese and Korean smugglers. The central government has now formulated strict inspection measures for smuggling and ordered the competent authorities to strictly implement them. This is a special reply, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs."</p>

It was previously rumored that Kawagoe's arrival would be delayed because Chairman Lin had scheduled to go to Lushan for summer vacation on the 20th, so the presentation of credentials would have to wait. The Japanese Embassy spokesman denied this yesterday.</p>

<h3>Cotton Control Council and Banking Sector to Visit Salt Reclamation Area in Northern Jiangsu; Preparing for Improvement of Cotton Industry and Investment; Delegation of More Than Ten People to Depart on the Evening of the 10th</h3>
<p>The National Economic Council's Cotton Control Council and the banking sector, at the invitation of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, will visit the cotton planting areas in the salt reclamation area in northern Jiangsu to prepare for the improvement of the cotton industry and investment. The Cotton Control Council and various banks have appointed experts and are scheduled to depart by ship on the 10th. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Scheduled Departure</p>
<p>Those invited to visit this time, in addition to the Cotton Control Council, include more than ten banks, including the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Yanye Bank, Jincheng Bank, Dalu Bank, Xingye Bank, China Farmers Bank, and Jiangsu Farmers Bank. The Cotton Control Council has appointed cotton planting experts Li Shengbo, Bian Bingwen, and Tong Runfu and others, a total of four people, to accompany more than ten people from various banks. They are scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the Daqing ship of the Dada Company on the evening of the 10th and go directly to Nantong.</p>
<p>Visiting Area</p>
<p>On the 12th, they will arrive in Nantong and be accompanied by staff from the Jiangsu Provincial Government to visit cotton planting areas in the salt reclamation areas in Nantong, Rugao, Haian, Dongtai, and Xinfengji. Then, they will go to Chenjiagang and Baojiadun in Haizhou. The itinerary is scheduled for half a month, and they will return to Shanghai around the 20th of this month. The purpose of this visit is to focus on investment. Because cotton production in northern Jiangsu has increased in recent years, and with the completion of the new canal, agriculture in the area will have a rapid development trend. In the future, it can be the best area for the banking sector to invest in rural areas.</p>
<p>Overview of Reclamation Area</p>
<p>The salt reclamation area in northern Jiangsu is extremely vast, stretching from Lvsizhen in Nantong to Chenjiagang in Haizhou, with an area of about 600 li from north to south and east to west. It was originally a swamp used for storing grass and boiling salt. Although there were already 3.8 million mu of reclaimed land, about 10 million mu of wasteland remained, and all of it was fertile land, which was very suitable for planting cotton. Therefore, once all the wasteland is reclaimed, it will be the largest source of wealth in Jiangsu Province.</p>

<h3>Taxpaying Chinese Association of the French Concession Requests Improvement of Concession's Tax Collection Methods; Improper Classification of Business Tax; Review Fees Not Assessed According to Standards</h3>
<p>Tax collection methods of the French Concession Public Works Department Tax Bureau, including improper classification of business tax, review fees not assessed according to standards, and unreasonable fines imposed by the Sanitation Department without allowing citizens to appeal, have been a concern of taxpaying Chinese in the Concession. They have written to the Taxpaying Chinese Association of the French Concession requesting negotiations regarding the improper classification of business and sanitation tax, the uncertain assessment of review fees, the prompt implementation of reduced housing tax, and the arbitrary penalties imposed by the Sanitation Department. The Taxpayers Association sent a letter to the French Concession Public Works Department yesterday, ordering the responsible personnel to improve the situation. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Improper Classification of Business Tax</p>
<p>"Dear Sir, according to the taxpaying Chinese in the Concession, there have been many complaints about the improper classification of business and sanitation tax, the uncertain assessment of review fees, the prompt implementation of reduced housing tax, and the arbitrary penalties imposed by the Sanitation Department. We hereby request negotiations. The revised business and sanitation tax regulations were promulgated in 1936 and divided into four levels: A, B, C, and D. There are no clear regulations regarding the classification standards. In addition, the original maximum amount for review fees was ten yuan, but as stated in Article 6, Item 4 of the regulations, the review fee for small businesses in categories A, B, C, and D opened in Chinese-style single-room houses may be reduced to two yuan. Also, according to the same item, the review fee for small industries in the second table of category B businesses may be reduced to one yuan. However, inspectors rarely assess according to the standards. The tax grade is entirely based on the speculation and conjecture of the inspectors, which has become the focus of recent disputes between the bureau and the citizens. For example:</p>
<p>Focus of Disputes Over Increased Taxes</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the increased tax portion: Yingkang Medical Garden at No. 150-152 Rue du Père Huc, which was originally 2.8 yuan, has now increased to 7 yuan. Fuzhengyuan Wine Store at No. 12 Rue du Père Huc, which was originally 1.4 yuan, has now increased to 2.8 yuan. Xiqingyong Wine Store at No. 64 Rue Gandi, which was originally 1.4 yuan, has now increased to 2.8 yuan. Zhang Hongsheng Wine Store at No. 180 Avenue Blanchy, which was originally 1.4 yuan, has now increased to 2.8 yuan. There is no clear notification of the standards and basis for these tax increases. If the size of the storefront is the standard, then the storefronts of the four stores remain the same and have not been expanded. If the prosperity of the business is the standard, then the businesses of the four stores have not improved and are not as prosperous as before. Since there are no standards to follow, these tax increases are unacceptable to the stores and are truly unreasonable.</p>
<p>Review Fees Should Be Fair</p>
<p>(B) Regarding the review fees: 1. Yu Feng Company at No. 101 Ningbo Road only rents one room. The width and size, as well as the number of employees, all meet the requirements for a small business, but the Tax Bureau forced them to pay a review fee of ten yuan. The improper collection of review fees is a widespread situation, and Yu Feng Company is not the only one. According to the regulations, the maximum amount is ten yuan. If the residence and the furnishings of the store belong to a small business, then the fee may be reduced to two yuan or one yuan. There are many differences between two yuan, one yuan, and ten yuan. A careful interpretation of the meaning of the provisions requires the inspector to examine the size of the business and then assess the fee. If it is not necessary to pay ten yuan, then how much should be paid? The most fair perspective should be used to estimate. However, inspectors often do not examine carefully and simply say two yuan or ten yuan. Other amounts are never heard of. As a result, merchants are wronged by arbitrary decisions beyond counting. Yu Feng Company is just one example, and there are many others. This is what we hope the Tax Bureau will rectify.</p>
<p>Request for Housing Tax Reduction According to Proportions</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the 1936 budget of the Public Works Department, it was stated that when the rent is used as the basis for the rental value, the total amount of rent should be reduced proportionally according to the amount of benefits enjoyed by the tenant from the landlord for calculation purposes. 1. If the rent includes tap water supply, it should be reduced by 5%. 2. For houses with electricity supply, the rent should be reduced by 5%. 3. For rent that includes garbage incineration facilities, it should be reduced by 10%. 4. For houses with electrical equipment, the rent should be reduced by 10%. Although the regulations have been promulgated, the reductions have not yet been implemented, which has led to questions from taxpayers. The Public Works Department should order the rent collection agencies in the Concession to promptly report the rent situation for verification and reduction in order to be practical.</p>
<p>Arbitrary Penalties by the Sanitation Department Should Be Improved</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is a great need to improve the methods for unsanitary penalty cases in the Concession. Currently, Public Works Department investigators only target places where garbage is piled up. As a result, false penalties are heard of every day, and when people are falsely accused, the police do not allow them to appeal and even beat them, which is very improper. In another case, Ruixing Restaurant at No. 153 Route Conty was punished by the Public Works Department for unsanitary conditions because it was ordered by the West Patrol to clean up the garbage left by street vendors. This kind of measure is particularly absurd and should be ordered to be corrected by the Tax Bureau to avoid unjustly accusing the innocent. All of the above situations are widespread in the Concession and are the most disputed situations. We hope that you will order the responsible personnel to improve them quickly and look forward to your reply. Respectfully, to the General Manager of the French Concession Public Works Department, Mr. Badet."</p>

Arrangements have been made to equip hospitals for free vaccinations for citizens and for the accommodation of sick people. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Health Campaign Opens on the 15th</p>
<p>The 15th Municipal Health Campaign Assembly has been decided by the preparatory meeting to open on the 15th of this month and close at the end of the month.

It will be divided into households, factories, schools, public places, shantytowns, and rural areas, distributing health knowledge and epidemic prevention pictures, slogans, and leaflets to each household. At that time, city cleaners will conduct a major cleaning of streets, rivers, vegetable stalls, and markets, and work to eliminate flies.</p>

Public concession French concession health authorities have also sent a large number of epidemic prevention vehicles to various districts to inject epidemic prevention needles,</p>
<h3>The National Physicians Association Calls for the Protection of Medical Rights; Medical Talents Should Be Respected by Society; the Current Physician Regulations are Insufficient to Guarantee Protection</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Physicians Association yesterday submitted a document to the Ministry of Health, stating that the Physician Law and the Physician Guild Law have not yet been promulgated, and medical rights have lost their protection.</p>
<p>It earnestly requests that measures be taken to provide relief. Medicine is the culmination of scientific achievements, and progress has only been achieved today through gradual academic programs, considerable time, and rigorous study and practice. Therefore, medical talents should be respected by society. In advanced countries, medical rights are guaranteed by national laws. Not only are there clear provisions in the Physician Law, but also the Physician Guild Law, which allows for the combined efforts of the same profession to supervise, encourage, and safeguard rights and interests, thereby supplementing the inadequacies of the law. This is also an expression of valuing medical talents. Old Chinese medicine is crude and absurd, and has long been despised by the literati. Only those who have failed in both learning and swordsmanship retreat to study medicine. After reading a little of the Tangtou Song Formula, they go out to practice medicine. Since their learning is so superficial, society regards them as lowly witches, and it is appropriate that they do not have the protection of national laws. In the past thirty years, thanks to the government's advocacy and promotion of new medicine, efforts have not been spared, and talents have gradually increased and practical results have become increasingly apparent. However, society's ingrained negative attitude towards medicine has not changed slightly. Even administrative officials cannot avoid being misled by popular views, and there are even those who undermine medical rights. At the fourth national congress convened by the association, members from various regions reported that they were suffering from the arbitrary and harsh regulations and exorbitant taxes imposed by provincial and county authorities, or from the arbitrary exercise of power and abuse of authority by public security personnel. The losses in business and spirit were difficult to describe in detail. Therefore, there was a proposal to request the Ministry to set up a method for relief. After discussion by the conference, it was generally believed that this phenomenon was inevitable before the promulgation of the Physician Law and the Physician Guild Law. The current Provisional Physician Regulations can be used as a basis, but the content is too sketchy and insufficient to protect medical rights. Therefore, it was resolved to earnestly request that all levels of主管官吏官吏 be notified to invite local physicians' guilds to send representatives to attend and contribute opinions to the formulation of local single medical and health regulations before the promulgation of such regulations, so that there would be no bias and it would be easy to implement. It is also hoped that the public security authorities will be strictly ordered to be cautious about abusing their authority and that formal physicians should not be arrested, detained, or interrogated and punished in order to respect medicine and safeguard medical rights. In addition, Article 4 of the current Provisional Physician Regulations, which does not grant physician certificates, Clause 1, those who have been sentenced to more than three years of imprisonment for reasons other than engaging in the National Revolution, since the implementation of the new criminal law, this provision has been overly harsh. Article 276, Section 2 of the New Criminal Law states that those engaged in business who commit the crime in the preceding paragraph (negligent homicide) due to negligence in their business shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than five years. If a doctor is accidentally invoked by this article due to an unavoidable accident and sentenced to three years of imprisonment, according to the provisions of the preceding Provisional Physician Regulations, he will never be able to practice medicine again. Not only is there a sense of light crime and heavy punishment for doctors, but also for the sake of national talent, the loss is also great and superficial. Therefore, the conference also resolved to earnestly request the government to submit a request to the court for amendment. All of these aspects are closely related to the interests of the new medical community.</p>
<p>Therefore, based on the resolutions, a document is submitted to the senior officials, who are requested to consider that the Physician Law and the Physician Guild Law have not yet been promulgated and that medical rights have no protection at all, and to generously provide appropriate maintenance, adopt my humble opinions, and implement them promptly, so as to reduce the losses of our new medical community in terms of work and spirit. This is truly convenient for the public. Respectfully submitted to the Director of the Ministry of Health, Liu,</p>

<h3>Issuing Six-Percent Bonds to Complete the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway; Totaling £1.1 Million with a Term of 25 Years; Underwritten by the Sino-British Chinese Construction Bank Corporation</h3>
<p>In order to complete the Zhapu to Cao'e River section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway and the Hangzhou-Shaoxing section, and to jointly build the Qiantang River Bridge with the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the Ministry of Railways obtained a loan of 16 million yuan from the Chinese Construction Bank Corporation and the Sino-British Bank Corporation in October 1934, with an interest rate of 5.5 percent. The Ministry of Railways has now agreed with the two banks to revise the loan contract to be 1.1 million pounds, equivalent to more than 18 million yuan in national currency, with the annual interest rate changed to 6 percent. Sterling six-percent bonds will be issued and underwritten by the two banks. The contract has now been approved by the Legislative Yuan, and the syndicate is allowed to issue bonds soon. According to a report by a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency, the face value of the bonds will be denominated in sterling, divided into three types: £10, £50, and £100. They will not be circulated on the market in the future, but will be underwritten by the two banks and sold abroad. The credit of Chinese railway bonds in the foreign market is well-known, and foreigners are happy to buy them. The term is 25 years, starting from July 1941, and the principal will be repaid twice a year until it is fully repaid in 1961. The Ministry of Railways will establish a fund management committee to oversee the repayment of principal and interest.</p>

<h3>Important Resolutions of the Seafood Guild; Strictly Prohibiting Members from Purchasing Smuggled Goods; Reward of 300 Yuan for Reporting Secrets</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Seafood and Sundries Industry Guild has always attached great importance to the southward invasion of smuggled goods from North China and has spared no effort to prevent it. In addition to issuing various anti-smuggling laws and regulations promulgated by the government to all members for reference, it has also strictly ordered all members not to purchase or sell seafood of unknown origin. It is now heard that Mr. Ge Weian, chairman of the association, in order to be more thorough, specially convened the fourth plenary meeting of managers yesterday. A total of 43 industry managers attended, including Ge Weian, Wu Hankang, Zhou Liangui, Xiao Weiqing, Yu Yunxiang, Hua Nanshan, Zhou Baochu, Chen Lichen, and Wang Dachuan. The meeting was chaired by Ge Weian and recorded by Xu Xizhen. It was resolved that, in order to assist the government in preventing smuggling and achieving practical results quickly, all members should fill out a voluntary statement of not buying smuggled goods and submit it to the association for record. This voluntary statement should be signed and sealed by the managers of each firm. If anyone can report a member of the association who purchases smuggled goods and is found to be true by the association, and the case is solved as a result, in addition to the public reward they are entitled to, the association will add a reward of 300 yuan to encourage them, and a notice will be published to solicit secret reports. Whether the government's regulations on distribution licenses include the breaking up of the original items, or are limited to the original items, should be immediately sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for a clear explanation. If it is limited to the original items, the Ministry of Finance should issue separate regulations on the transportation and sale of disassembled items to provide relief (remainder omitted).</p>
<h3>After the Chinese Yangtze River Pilots Petition, the Central Government Agrees to be Managed by the Ministry of Communications; the Ministry of Civil Training Has Drafted Measures; It is Decided to Request the Government to Promulgate a Pilotage Law</h3>
<p>Chinese Yangtze River pilotage representatives Feng Fucheng and others, who went to Beijing to petition, returned to Shanghai the night before last, having achieved satisfactory results in Beijing, and released the following details of the petition to visitors:</p>
<p>Purpose of the Request</p>
<p>The purpose of the Chinese Yangtze River pilots' petition is to promulgate a pilotage law to reclaim pilotage rights and abolish the Shanghai Pilotage Management Committee, transferring full management to the Ministry of Communications. Previously, China did not pay attention to pilotage rights, resulting in them being controlled by foreigners. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it gradually began to pay attention to this, and in 1929, the Naval Ministry established a pilotage training institute, training more than 300 qualified students. In 1933, the Ministries of Finance, Navy, Communications, and Staff jointly formed the Shanghai Pilotage Management Committee, which was originally established to protect Chinese nationals. However, the customs commissioner representing the Ministry of Finance still held the position of chairman, and representatives of foreign chambers of commerce participated. Not only did they disregard the legal qualifications of the Naval Ministry's pilotage training institute, but they also implemented control over Chinese pilots on the Yangtze River, while providing convenience for foreign personnel, allowing them to develop and not restricting them. The government's reclamation was a mere formality, the suffering of the Chinese people and the danger to national defense were even greater than before. Therefore, Chinese Yangtze River pilots believe this is a major concern and have repeatedly called for help and requested assistance from all sectors of the country to achieve the goal of complete reclamation as soon as possible in order to strengthen sovereignty and maintain national defense.</p>
<p>Petition Process</p>
<p>The representatives arrived in Beijing on the 3rd of this month and submitted petitions to the Central Ministry of Civil Training and the Executive Yuan. The opinions they raised were accepted by the authorities, and the results were very satisfactory. The Ministry of Civil Training has also drafted measures and expressed to the representatives that it is determined to request the government to promulgate a pilotage law to reclaim pilotage rights, abolish the pilotage management committee, and transfer the pilotage personnel to the full management of the Ministry of Communications. Therefore, the representatives considered themselves satisfied and returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to Mr. Feng, the petition in Beijing was supported by all sectors and the maritime organizations, for which they are deeply grateful.</p>
<h3>The Preparatory Committee of the Special District Meat Industry Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday to Discuss the Organization of an Investigation Team to Rectify Market Prices; Requesting the Municipal Council to Prohibit the Use of Balance Scales</h3>
<p>The fresh meat industry in this city has recently faced difficulties in its operation due to the scarcity of pig sources and soaring pig prices. On the 6th of last month, the Shanghai Meat Industry Guild collectively discussed price increases. It is learned that the industry in the special district still does not sell according to the stipulated prices. At the same time, it is affected by other industry members and citizens not using market scales. Therefore, they have filed requests with the Preparatory Committee of the First Special District Branch of the Shanghai Fresh Meat Industry Guild, requesting immediate and strict rectification. After receiving the report, the committee convened an emergency meeting of the preparatory committee yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. More than 20 people attended, including Wu Gensheng, Fan Deyi, Rong Fuchang, and Chen Longhu. The meeting was chaired by Sun Hongyang and recorded by Mao Yicheng. The chairman first reported the significance of the meeting. Then, the following cases were immediately resolved: (A) In recent days, more industry members have come to the association claiming that the prices stipulated by the representatives' meeting on the 6th of last month (which were publicly announced by the Shanghai Fresh Meat Industry Guild in the newspaper) have not been followed by a small number of industry members to this day. At the same time, restaurants, noodle shops, kitchens, and citizens are not using market scales, making it difficult to operate. It is necessary to strictly rectify this. As a result, no clues were obtained, and it should be decided what to do. It was resolved that the association should send a letter to the general guild, requesting that the Social Bureau forward it to the Municipal Council to notify all industries to use market scales uniformly, and to send patrols to prohibit citizens from carrying balance scales to ensure fairness. An investigation team should be organized by the association to go to various districts to investigate. If there are those who still do not sell according to the stipulated prices, they should be strictly advised; otherwise, the pig market should be notified to stop their dealings. At the same time, industry members must not collude; otherwise, the industry member will be subject to the same regulations. The investigators will be issued badges and printed photos by the association for identification. If the investigators have not found out, but the industry members know about it, they should immediately report it to the association. After the investigation is confirmed, the measures resolved in the second item will be implemented. (B) The case of recommending investigators for various districts was resolved to recommend 30 people, including Wu Gensheng, as investigators. (C) The case of reporting the above resolutions to all industry members immediately was resolved to send notices to inform all industry members. The meeting adjourned after the resolutions were made.</p>

<h3>The Weather Resembles Late Autumn; Wind and Rain Again in This Port; This Year's Rainfall Exceeds Last Year's; Abnormal Weather Rarely Seen in Recent Years</h3>
<p>Local Weather: This year has been particularly marked by much rain and little sunshine. Since the beginning of summer, the weather has been consistently cool and cold, unlike summer. The night before last, there was wind and rain throughout the night, which continued until yesterday morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>This Year's Rainfall</p>
<p>According to the records of the Astronomical Observatory, from January to the end of May this year, there were a total of fifty-four days of rainfall in Shanghai, with a total rainfall of 13.37 inches. Compared with the rainfall of 10.27 inches in the same period last year, it exceeds the previous year by 3.1 feet. At the same time, the climate is far less favorable than the same period last year, which has greatly hindered agricultural production.</p>
<p>Cold Weather</p>
<p>Since the arrival of summer, the weather has remained persistently cold. Although there was a slight warming trend a few days ago, it suddenly changed the day before yesterday, with very strong winds all day. Wind and rain continued throughout the night, lasting until last night. The weather resembles late autumn, and warm clothing is needed. This kind of abnormal weather has rarely been seen in recent years.</p>
<p>Huangpu River Tide Recedes</p>
<p>Since the 4th of this month, the high tide in the Huangpu River has suddenly increased, with levels all above ten feet. The highest tide was at 1:54 AM on the 7th, when the water level was ten feet and four inches above the lowest tide. However, since yesterday, it has begun to recede.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Local Court Detains Xu Wancheng; Xu Surrenders Himself, but the Judge Still Fears His Escape; Immediately Issued an Arrest Warrant and Sent Him to the Detention Center</h3>
<p>Xu Wancheng, the editor of the Longwen Bookstore located at No. 3 Baiyang Alley, Zhonghua Road, west of the Dainanmen, published a special issue of the "Xu Wancheng Work Report" attached to the "Minbao" on the 3rd of this month. It contained an "Investigation into the Dark Side of China's Judiciary," and its content mostly targeted the Shanghai Local Court. It mentioned incidents such as the theft of handguns from the court's stolen goods warehouse and severely attacked the president of the court. The text also stated, "Shops that evade stamp duty should be punished. When executing these laws, it should target the main figures. This case should also be executed according to the law, and everyone should be treated equally." It also mentioned that court clerks often openly solicit money and finally claimed that Judge Zhao and others accepted bribes, among other accusations. It further stated that the judge reverses right and wrong and that it should be clearly stipulated that anyone doing so should be punished by death. The court could tolerate other attacks, but regarding the accusation of Zhao and others accepting bribes, Judges Zhao Yongzhou and Zhao Yuesheng requested that Xu Wancheng be summoned to testify and report the accusations. Xu claimed that he had copied it from another newspaper. Therefore, the prosecutor ordered him to present the newspaper as evidence on Monday. However, Xu not only had no such basis but also sent a letter to the "Minbao" legal column on the 5th, again claiming that the court was "covering up its face," etc. Therefore, the two Judges Zhao believed that if this case were not pursued, it would affect their careers. Therefore, they specifically filed a complaint as victims. Furthermore, Xu Wancheng had a debt case in Judge Zhao Yongzhou's hands and lost the case, which further indicated that he was seeking revenge. Judge Zhao did not pursue evidence of bribery. Therefore, the court continued its investigation yesterday. Xu sent a representative, Liu Lianyuan, to the court in the morning, but he was informed that criminal cases do not allow representatives, so it was not permitted. In the afternoon at 2:00 PM, Xu Wancheng personally surrendered himself. Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu immediately opened a court for preliminary interrogation. The judge asked him to produce the newspaper from which he claimed to have copied, but Xu could not respond and instead claimed that he was mentally disordered. The judge believed that Xu Wancheng's behavior was despicable and feared that he would escape once indicted. Therefore, the court ordered his detention and immediately issued an arrest warrant, sending Xu to the detention center.</p>
<h3>Four Packs of Poison Pills Found in a Japanese Newspaper; Trafficker Wang Ziqing Arrested</h3>
<p>Hua Detective Cui Chengke of the Huishan Patrol captured a man named Wang Ziqing from Haimen, who was selling red pills, near Daliangwan Road and Kunming Road at around 9:00 PM the night before last. Four packs of poison pills, totaling two thousand pills, were found in a black cloth bag and a Japanese newspaper. He was taken to the patrol station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the Special First Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that there were also Japanese characters on the package. The defendant claimed at the patrol station that the main culprit behind these red pills was two Japanese who hired him to deliver them. He requested further investigation. Detective Cui then submitted a report explaining the process of the arrest and presented the evidence for inspection. When questioned, Wang Ziqing confessed that two Japanese gave him these red pills at Shenjiawan, Wusong Road, and instructed him to deliver them to No. 547, Daliangwan Road. A Chinese person holding a newspaper would be the signal. He had already delivered them once in a week and received two yuan each time. The rest of his confession was evasive. Judge Xiao ordered him to be remanded in custody for further investigation at a later date.</p>
<h3>Four Members of the Song Xihou Family in Sida Village, Remi Road, Attacked; Two Young Men in Western Suits Entered the House Under the Pretense of Delivering a Letter; Four People Were Shot, and Song Himself Died; The Patrol Believes There is Another Reason for This Case</h3>
<p>Song Xihou, a Hua compradore who used to work for the British merchant Hezhelin Cotton Yarn Office, was from Yuyao, Zhejiang, and was 45 years old. His home was at No. 10, Sida Village, Dingjia Alley, No. 142 Remi Road, French Concession of Shanghai West. He retired three years ago. At 11:35 AM yesterday, Song was having lunch at home when two young men wearing Western suits suddenly came to talk to Song. After the servant reported, Song met them in the parlor on the second floor. Unexpectedly, before they had said a few words, the two young men took out handguns from their sleeves and attacked Song. One bullet hit Song's abdomen. At that time, Song's concubine, Cao (29 years old, from Changshu), and two Changshu maids, Du Chen (43 years old) and Yuan Xu (42 years old), heard the noise and rushed out. They happened to meet the two thugs. Fearing that things would go wrong, the two thugs fired several shots at the three, and all three fell to the ground after being hit. Cao was hit in the back of the head by a bullet that did not penetrate. Du Chen was hit weakly on the left cheek, and Yuan Xu was injured on the right leg. Fortunately, Song's daughter, Meizhen, heard the continuous gunshots upstairs and knew that something was wrong. Suspecting it was a robbery, she bravely ran to the balcony on the third floor and blew the police whistle frantically. Seeing that they had injured several people and hearing the police whistle, the two young men rushed out the door together and fled. Song's family members quickly called the patrol station. The patrol chief immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. After a detailed investigation, they believed that this case was not a robbery and injury case, and that there might be another reason behind it. After the investigation, they first sent the four injured people to Guangci Hospital. Meanwhile, they started investigating the criminals. Song himself died after arriving at the hospital due to his serious injuries. His concubine, Cao, was also seriously injured and her life was in danger.</p>
<h3>International Eccentric Monk Zhaokong to Leave China Again; Busy Preparing for Departure</h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the international eccentric monk Zhaokong came to China last winter with dozens of his followers. After repeated trips to Europe and the United States, he was refused entry and had to return to Shanghai. He stayed at Moliai Road in the legal community with plans to stay for a long time. However, the Dagong News Agency reporter learned that Zhaokong plans to travel to Europe and the United States again in mid-month. He reportedly plans to go to Japan first, then to the United States, and then to various countries in Europe, such as Germany and Italy. Zhaokong has been busy preparing for his departure in recent days, so it is expected that he will be allowed to leave at the appointed time.</p>
<h3>The Main Culprit in the Assassination of Chen Hougui Was Arrested Upon Returning to Shanghai</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of March 29th this year, a murder case occurred in the room of Mrs. San Ayi's nephew above the building at No. 604, Edward Road. At that time, Chen Hougui, a Danyang native, was seriously injured by knives and axes. The murderers all escaped. After the patrol station received a report, Chen was sent to the hospital for treatment but died. Subsequently, Lu Gengen, a Chinese detective from the Lao Zha Patrol Station, captured Li Liangqing (nicknamed "Little Chatterbox"), a criminal in the case. It was found that the deceased used to work at the Zhengda Printing House on North Henan Road and was later dismissed. After losing his job, the deceased gathered people to gamble and skim profits in room 308 of the Tianran Hotel. Zhang Abing (also known as Bingsheng), a Suzhou rogue, found out and ordered his disciple Liangqing to extort the deceased. Because the deceased refused, a feud developed, which led to the murder. At that time, the patrol station sent the suspect to the First Special District Court for questioning. As a result, the court sentenced the suspect to twelve years in prison for jointly causing death through injury. The court issued an arrest warrant for Zhang Abing. Now, Detective Lu learned that Zhang had fled to Suzhou after the incident and returned to Shanghai on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. He joined Western Detective Huogengsheng and went to No. 87, Anqie Village, North Xizang Road, and arrested Zhang. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special First Court. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the patrol station, prosecuted him under Article 277, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. He claimed that due to time constraints, Li Liangqing could not be brought from the Western Prison, so he requested a postponement of the trial. When questioned, Zhang Abing denied that the suspect was his disciple and claimed that he did not know the deceased or others. He claimed that he had been ill in Suzhou since March 22nd and presented a prescription as proof. He also hired lawyer Yu Hualong to defend him. Qian Hongye, the head of the Criminal Court, verified the confession and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for further questioning in a week.</p>
<h3>Wu Song and Her Son Sue Wu Chengxiang for Acknowledgment of Paternity; Cohabitation for More Than Ten Years, Then Abandonment; Requesting a Ruling for Adoption to Uphold Human Relations</h3>
<p>Wu Chengxiang, the former director of the loan department of the Silk Industry Bank and a native of Shaoxing, opened the Dalai Tea House in Chunxiang Alley, West Gate, with his friend Luo Jinfu two years ago. His family lived at No. 36 Taian Alley, Tiantong Road. Recently, Wu Youzhang, a thirteen-year-old child residing at No. 63, Yongqing Alley, Aidong Near Road, was represented by his mother, Wu Song (39 years old), as his guardian. They hired lawyer Lu to file a complaint with the Civil Court of the First Special District Court, accusing Wu Chengxiang of malicious abandonment and requesting confirmation of the parent-child relationship and a ruling for adoption. In 1922, Wu Chengxiang seduced Song (also known as Jia Gu), the biological mother of Youzhang, into cohabiting. They had several children, but all died except for Youzhang. The defendant, Wu Chengxiang, took advantage of the fact that Song's husband was a businessman who had been away for a long time and had no news. He took over the nest without any scruples. Later, when Song ran out of money, the defendant moved to Aixinhao, abandoning the plaintiff and her son like worn-out shoes after more than ten years of exploitation. Their livelihood was frequently cut off. What is even more hateful is that the plaintiff is clearly his biological son, and there is irrefutable evidence, but the defendant ignores it. Therefore, they request confirmation of the parent-child relationship and a ruling for adoption to uphold human relations. This case was heard yesterday morning in the Civil Sixth Court by Judge Li. The defendant did not appear and sent a lawyer to defend him. After briefly questioning the plaintiff and her son, the court ordered the case to be adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed Request to Waive Export Tax on Qingtian Stone</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday, stating: "To the Ministry of Finance, Nanjing. According to a letter from Zhou Huaixuan, a representative of the Qingtian Stone Carving Industry, dated the 6th of this month, Qingtian has many mountains and little land, and the land is barren and the people are poor. Women and children in the countryside rely on the Qingtian stone carving industry for their livelihood. Before the European War, exports to foreign countries could earn hundreds of thousands of yuan each year. Since then, tax rates have increased, and sales have gradually decreased. In recent years, income has been less than one hundred thousand yuan. Those who look to the roof and sigh, and cry in poverty, are struggling to maintain their livelihoods. Unexpectedly, the Ministry of Finance has increased the export tax on these carvings starting March 1st of this year. This will not only leave the common people with no hope for their livelihoods but will also affect the country's revenue. Exports of local products, such as paper umbrellas, straw mats, and embroidery from Wenzhou, are all tax-exempt. The essence of Qingtian stone is originally stubborn and difficult to split. After much hard work, carving can be accomplished. Labor is time-consuming, and the cost is no less than that of paper umbrellas. According to regulations, tax exemption should be requested to avoid regrets and to show fairness. Moreover, Qingtian has suffered from banditry, and most houses are empty. Farmers have lost their timing, and businesses are closed in the market. This handicraft industry, which is related to the poor, will also be cut off due to the increase in taxes. If no measures are taken, the good people will be forced to starve to death, and the unruly will take risks. Public security is also a concern. Therefore, we present this request, hoping that your association will consider the livelihoods of the poor in our county, provide assistance, and unanimously advocate for the exemption of this export tax to maintain industry and commerce. This would be a great blessing." We have investigated that when the country is facing rampant smuggling and a shortage of tax revenue, it is difficult to discuss reducing export tariffs. Even the association did not dare to request it rashly. However, it is claimed that the annual sales of Qingtian stone to foreign countries are less than one hundred thousand yuan. This export tax, even if calculated at 7.5% of the value, will still be less than one thousand yuan per year. If the tax is waived, it will not affect public funds, but it will greatly benefit the local handicraft industry. It is reasonable to report the situation to your department for review and approval. It would be a great convenience for the public. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows."</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government to Request the Apprehension of Stolen Goods and Thieves from a Robbed Pig Boat</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Zhenjiang yesterday, stating: "To the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Zhenjiang. According to a letter from the Fresh Pork Sales Industry Association dated the 15th of this month, we have received a letter from our colleagues Xi Jinyuan, Chen Xide, and others, stating that on the 8th of this month, they hired the Jin Yuanli sand boat from Rugao, their hometown, to transport 230 pigs to Shanghai for sale. Unexpectedly, at around 1:00 AM that night, when the boat passed the Eleventh Regiment Port, Tongzhou, on the opposite bank of Tiansheng Port, a pirate ship suddenly appeared. A dozen or so bandits, armed with six or seven long and short guns, speaking in mixed dialects, and making a lot of noise, ordered the boat to stop and plundered it at will. With a whoop, they rowed away fully loaded. After checking, 52 piglets were robbed, including 27 from Xi Jinyuan's Jincai brand and 25 from Chen Xide's Rencaiyuan brand, as well as 10 yuan in national currency, clothing, and other items, with a total loss of about 900 yuan. The pigs sold by Jinyuan and others are mostly obtained on credit. Once they suffer this disaster, their livelihood will be cut off. We are forced to report the facts and request that you forward them to the competent authorities for prompt arrest of the fugitive bandits, strict punishment according to the law, and recovery of the stolen goods. Then we will all be grateful." We have learned that robberies of pig boats occur from time to time. For example, on March 2nd of last year, Miao Changfa's boat was robbed of 46 piglets at the 200-mu area near Langshan outside the Wusong Estuary. On November 8th of the same year, Yang Baozhu's boat, transporting Tang Baoquan's piglets, was robbed of 52 piglets near Shiziling. Most recently, last month, Gu Zhengqing and Zhang Dalin's piglets were robbed of 35 piglets in the Baimao Sand area. In summary, the robbery locations are all on the main transportation routes between Shanghai and Jiangsu, where boats travel frequently and are prosperous. The bandits dare to gather and rob, which shows that the area is poorly guarded and endangers merchant ships. If they are allowed to remain at large, the consequences will be dire. Merchants may stop traveling and consider it a long journey. Based on the reported situation, we hereby request your association to promptly telegraph the competent official authorities of Jiangsu Province to order their subordinates to pursue and arrest the bandits and punish them severely so that the stolen goods can be returned to their original owners. This will not only benefit our industry but also rely on the local public security. We look forward to your assistance. We have checked that within the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province, according to the association's information, there have been four pig boat robberies in the past year, and few have been solved. It is difficult to sleep peacefully for such freight transportation. The water public security team, which is responsible for patrolling and arresting, is responsible for the negligence. Based on the letter and the previous situation, it is appropriate to telegraph your government for review and approval, urging the water public security police team to tighten the investigation on the one hand, strive to recover the stolen goods and arrest the bandits, and patrol regularly on the other hand, so that the bandits will stop, and merchants will be safe. We look forward to it very much. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows."</p>

<h3>Changyin Chinese Knitting Factory Trademark Printed Illegally; Local Court Summoned Yesterday</h3>
<p>Cai Yinqiao, the owner of the Shanghai China First Knitting Factory on Sichuan Road, found out that Changyin, a printing house located at Jincheng Printing House, Anlan Road, West Gate, was illegally printing the trademark of his factory. He reported it to the police, who searched and seized seven counterfeit printing molds. The shop owner, Jin Zubei, and his partner, Yang Boliang, were arrested, and more than 100,000 trademark papers were copied. After questioning, it was learned that the above-mentioned trademark paper was entrusted by Yang Ruijin, the owner of Hengda Printing House at No. 99, Siwenli, Xinzha Road. Yang was arrested and confessed that he was instructed by Fa Xian to print. Li was also arrested, and hundreds of fake trademarks were copied, mixed with four pairs of black chrysanthemum brand inferior socks, and sent to the local court. In addition to the defendants being temporarily released on bail, the prosecutor is now prosecuting the defendants together. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu opened the trial. Cai Yinqiao testified, "I am fifty-seven years old. I received letters from the outside world in the second half of last year saying that someone was selling Changyin brand socks. I started investigating and only found out on May 2nd that Jincheng Printing House was at No. 8, Ningkangli, Four Gates. The second defendant is Jin Zubei, and Yang Boliang is his partner.

The black chrysanthemum trademark was printed on behalf of Yang Ruijin. Yang also runs a printing house, but he cannot print it himself, so he entrusted me to print it," and so on. At this point, the judge said, "Li Zaixian and Yang Ruijin have not arrived today. They should be summoned again for questioning."</p>

<h3>Public Concession: Three Robbery Cases in One Day</h3>
<p>Route D'affaires (now Huashan Road): Ding Chengrong, a man from Shaoxing, aged 20, lived at 7 Gaozhao Xing Lane, Route D'affaires. He worked as a bill collector for a local newspaper. He had recently set up his own office at his home. Yesterday morning around 7:00 AM, Ding left his house with over 350 yuan in collected funds, intending to deposit it. Unexpectedly, just as he reached the entrance of the lane, three bandits stopped him. They threw a bag of lime powder at his face. Ding, realizing the danger, desperately resisted the bandits. However, he was outnumbered and ultimately defeated. All the funds were stolen. At that moment, Ding was extremely anxious and shouted for help. Nearby patrol officers heard the alarm and rushed to the scene to pursue the bandits. They apprehended one bandit nearby and recovered part of the stolen money on his person. Both were taken to the police station to await trial by the court.</p>
<p>Soochow Creek Road (now Suzhou Creek Road): Zhen Zhi of Anhui province, resided at No. 31, Lane 714, Soochow Creek Road, west of Shanghai. He was a manager at the Yichangsheng Soap Factory. Around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, while the maid was opening the door to prepare water, six bandits suddenly forced their way in, went straight upstairs, woke up Zhen and his family, forbade them from making any noise, and forced them to hand over the keys to the chests. They opened each one and searched and looted everything. After about an hour, they fled. Before leaving, the bandits saw a bicycle downstairs and stole it as well. Afterwards, the victim checked and found that he had lost over 1,000 yuan in cash, foreign currency, and jewelry. He immediately prepared a list of the stolen items and reported it to the Gordon Road Police Station (now Nanjing West Road Police Station), requesting an investigation. The police station immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene to investigate and will pursue the bandits for trial after they are apprehended.</p>
<p>Pingliang Road: At a residence with the address of No. 366 Pingliang Road, belonging to someone surnamed Mou, four bandits arrived at around 8:40 PM last night to commit a robbery. First, two unarmed bandits tricked their way into opening the main door, then two armed bandits with pistols forced their way into the inner room, confining all the men and women in the house. They then threatened them to hand over valuables. However, the Mou family was not wealthy, so they were only robbed of 86 yuan in cash and fled. The victim reported the incident to the local police station, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3>Weak Will of a Country Woman: A Page in a History of Depravity. Divorced from her husband, she willingly became a mistress. Stealing gold jewelry, she was accused by relatives.</h3>
<p>Lin Zuolong, a man from Fujian province, currently working as a wireless radio officer in the Zhengji Shipping Company's Shanghai-Qingdao route, is 30 years old. Two years ago, he married Dan Keqing (also known as Zhaoqiu, 18 years old this year), a woman from his hometown of Fuzhou. After the marriage, Lin came to Shanghai to work, while Dan stayed in the countryside. Last winter, because Lin's cousin, Wang Lin (her husband was the late Wang Jingshun, former liaison section chief of the Shanghai Diplomatic Commissioner's Office), had vacant rooms at No. 34 Taoyuan Village, Route Lafayette (now Fuxing Middle Road) in the French Concession, Lin brought his wife Dan Keqing to Shanghai to stay at Wang's house. Lin himself, due to his work on the ship, entrusted his cousin to take care of his wife. Wang Lin trusted Dan quite a bit, so she gave Dan the key to the iron safe. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Shanghai, Dan became obsessed with cabaret dances. Between January and February of this year, she met Fei Shengxiang, a young man from Wuxi who worked as a pattern maker. They fell in love. Dan often wrote love letters at home to send to Fei, but she never sent them. Instead, she discarded them in the wastepaper basket. Wang Lin found them and hid them in the iron safe. Last month, Lin Zuolong returned to Shanghai and discovered that Dan's behavior was unusual. He gathered matchmakers and witnesses on the 23rd of last month and signed a divorce agreement at a law firm, officially ending their marriage. After the divorce, Dan took all her clothes and other belongings and went with her lover Fei Shengxiang back to Fei's house in Xuejiadu near the Zhoujingxiang train station in Wuxi to live together. However, Fei already had a wife. Only then did she realize that she had been deceived. She had no choice but to endure being a concubine. On the 28th of last month, Wang Lin, Lin Zuolong's cousin, opened the iron safe and found that two love letters and gold jewelry worth 330 yuan were missing. She knew that Dan had stolen them. She reported the theft to the French police station, requesting an investigation. The police station reported to the Second Special District Court, which issued an arrest warrant. Detective Wang Zhongfa went to Wuxi, joined the Public Security Bureau, went to Fei's house in Xuejiadu, arrested Dan Keqing, recovered the stolen goods, and brought her back to Shanghai. Yesterday, she was sent to the 8th Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Yuan Jiahuang, a lawyer from the police department, presented the case, accusing her of theft. Xu Wufang, a lawyer representing the plaintiff, stated that the plaintiff's side had already recovered the stolen goods, with very little missing, and they could not avoid pursuing the matter. When questioned, Dan Keqing confessed to the theft, but said that she did not intend to steal, but only to retrieve the love letters. The police department lawyer expressed his opinion, saying that this case was not a crime that required prosecution by the plaintiff, and the plaintiff and the defendant were no longer related. He requested that the court investigate and adjudicate according to the law. Judge Sun Penghuan reviewed the confession and ordered that the debate should begin and then conclude. The court sentenced Dan Keqing to 30 days of detention, suspended for two years, and ordered the stolen goods to be returned to the plaintiff. After the sentencing, the defendant was released in court. Fei Shengxiang, Dan's lover, had also come to Shanghai after Dan was arrested and was in court yesterday to observe the proceedings. After Dan was released, she went back with Fei, leaving the courthouse.</p>

<h3>Da Chang Exchange Shop: A Bank Employee Steals from Himself. Theft of gold pounds, banknotes, and government bonds. After the crime, he and other people involved were arrested.</h3>
<p>The Da Chang Exchange Shop, located at No. 2246 East-West Huade Road (now Changyang Road) in Hongkou, was jointly opened by Zheng Lianqing, Wang Xishu, and others. Zheng was the manager, and Wang was the assistant manager. Three years ago, they hired Xu Tixiang from Shaoxing, Yuyao as an apprentice. Xu is now 24 years old. Because he worked diligently, he was promoted to warehouse keeper this year, sharing the responsibility with Lou Dingfu. The warehouse of the Da Chang Exchange Shop was located in the kitchen. The key to the warehouse was usually kept by Wu Heting, the bookkeeper. At 8:30 PM on the 6th of this month, after the exchange shop closed, Xu Tixiang suddenly had a wicked thought.</p>
<p>Seeing that the warehouse key had not been locked, he secretly entered and stole American, Hong Kong, Canadian, and Singaporean gold pounds, banknotes, and national government bonds with a total face value of 10,961.50 yuan. He took the stolen goods and hid them elsewhere. The shop did not know about the theft at the time. It was not until 9:00 AM the next morning (the 7th) that they discovered the theft. However, they did not know who the thief was, so they did not report it to the police at the time. Until after 1:00 PM, Xu Tixiang suddenly claimed that his father, Xu Weihan, had come to Shanghai from his hometown a few days ago and was staying at the Jiangxin Hotel, No. 40 Jinli, Shanxi Road, in Room No. 1. He wanted to visit him. Manager Zheng Lianqing approved his request. Unexpectedly, Xu did not return. Manager Zheng then realized that the theft was related to Xu and urgently went to the Hongkou Police Station to report it. Detectives Huang Fusen, Bao Shuji, Bao Tan Ni Jialai, Zhang Chou Shan, Feng Qishan, and Western Detective Gedengbai were specially dispatched to Room No. 1 of the Jiangxin Hotel at 11:20 AM yesterday, where they successively arrested Xu Weihan and Xu Kang, Ye Maozhao, and Lou Yuliang (all from Yuyao), who were cooks on the Xianghe Steamboat. Under questioning at the police station, Lou Yuliang confessed that the stolen goods were hidden in his bedroom at the Fengtai Coal Shop, No. 366 Kangti Road (now Kangding Road) in the French Concession (Lou was the bookkeeper of Fengtai). He also stated that Xu Tixiang had boarded the Xianghe Steamboat, preparing to escape to Hankou. Chinese and Western detectives rushed to the Xianghe Steamboat at the Shuntai Wharf on Broadway Road (now Daming Road) to arrest Xu Tixiang. At the same time, they went to the Fengtai Coal Shop, searched and recovered all the stolen goods, and brought them back to the police station. At 3:30 PM, the police station sent Xu Tixiang and the other four to the 3rd Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang, a lawyer from the police station, presented the facts of the case, requesting a postponement. Zheng Lianqing and Wang Xishu, managers of the Da Chang Exchange Shop, also testified about the theft. When questioned, the defendant Xu Tixiang confessed to the theft, saying that because his salary was low and everything was expensive, his income could not cover his expenses, so he resorted to this strategy. However, he said that this was his personal act and that he had no connection with the other defendants. After stealing the gold pounds and other items, he asked his father, Xu Weihan, to keep them for him and his father then handed them over to Lou Yuliang and other fellow villagers. When Xu Weihan and the other four were questioned, their testimonies were evasive. Judge Xiao ordered the five defendants to be detained and the hearing postponed to Friday of this week. The stolen goods were returned first.</p>

<p>Yang Wenying, a young woman of 23 years old, lived at No. 7 Ci Hui Nan Li, Hartung Road (now Xikang Road) and was a student at a certain girls' middle school. Recently, Wenying was not diligent in her schoolwork and spent her time pursuing modern trends. Her father was very dissatisfied. Around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, her father severely scolded Wenying. Afterwards, Wenying secretly took poison in her room and committed suicide. She was discovered by her family, who immediately rushed her to the hospital for treatment. However, due to the severe poisoning, the treatment was ineffective. She died from the poison at 9:00 PM.

At approximately 8:00 AM the next morning, a tea server on duty passed by the door of the room and heard moaning sounds inside. He quickly found a way to open the door and saw that Huang had ingested a large amount of potassium cyanide. There was poison residue around his mouth. Knowing that he had undoubtedly taken poison, he reported it to the Hongkou Police Station. An ambulance was dispatched to send him to the Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective.

<h3>Xu Qingyun's Daughter Sues to Confirm the Invalidity of a Contract; Trial Concluded; Sentence to be Pronounced the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Xu Qingyun, the deceased wealthy businessman and owner of Taichangxiang (three branches) and Qingchangxiang Foreign Goods Shop on Avenue Dubail (now Huaihai Middle Road), was from Pudong. He had assets of several million yuan. In his early years, he married a woman from his hometown, Chen, and had a daughter named Daxin (35 years old this year). Later, Xu took Chen as a concubine, and they had a son, Fusheng, and two daughters, Lanzhen and Huizhen. Afterwards, he abandoned his wife and daughter, ignoring them. His wife, Chen, sued Xu in the French court for favoring his concubine and neglecting his wife, along with a civil suit. A settlement was reached, and a divorce agreement was signed at the law office of Zheng Yuxiu, witnessed by lawyers Jin Yu, Ren Zhennan, and Li Xinyang, and drafted by Wang Jimen. Only Xu and Chen signed the agreement at the time. Xu Qingyun signed it two weeks later. Later, Xu's daughter Daxin discovered that her signature was on the divorce agreement, as well as a clause in the second article stating that the second party would never again claim the right to an analysis of the first party's assets. She objected to her father and filed a suit in the First Special District Court against the two lawyers, Zheng and Li, for breach of trust. The case was delayed until now due to the January 28th Incident. Recently, Xu Daxin hired three lawyers, Zhang Shizhao, Peng Yuanxun, and Zhang, and filed a suit in the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court against her father's concubine, Xu Chen, and her siblings, Xu Fusheng, Xu Lanzhen, and Xu Huizhen, seeking confirmation that the divorce contract signed by her deceased parents was invalid. Judge Ma Yishu has held several hearings, summoning witnesses Wang Jimen, Ren Zhennan, and Zhu Honglie for questioning. Due to the incomplete number of witnesses, he ordered a postponement. As reported in this newspaper, yesterday, another summons was issued for a continued hearing. The plaintiff Xu Daxin arrived with her lawyers. The defendants were still represented by lawyers. According to Xu Daxin's testimony, she was not present to sign at the time, and her signature was not a cross. The judge ordered Xu to write ten crosses and one name in court. Later, lawyer Jin Yu testified that Xu Chen and Xu Daxin, mother and daughter, were present to sign, and the clause stating that the second party could not claim an analysis of the first party's assets was added later. Lawyer Li Xinyang testified that Xu Chen received the written agreement several months later. Xu Daxin then wrote a letter questioning and objecting to the second clause. He did not know the content. At the time, he saw Chen sign two words, but he could not remember whether Daxin signed or not. He asked Daxin. At this point, the court understood the case and ordered the debate to begin. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that lawyer Jin Yu's testimony was biased towards Xu Qingyun, as he was a party involved. However, the testimonies of the other witnesses were consistent, indicating that Xu Daxin was not present to sign. He requested that the court rule the contract invalid. After the defendant's lawyer rebutted, the court declared the debate concluded and scheduled the verdict for 9:00 AM on the 11th.</p>
<h3>Jingfeng Printing and Dyeing Company Sues Huang Shengchang for Embezzlement, Seeking Recovery of Over 3,000 Gold</h3>
<p>Huang Shengchang, currently the factory director of the Weilun Woolen Mill at No. 12, Lane 21, Hubei Road, served as the general manager of the Jingfeng Printing and Dyeing Co., Ltd. at No. 1188, the intersection of Zhoujiazui Road and Dalianwan Road, from February 1, 1934, to July 31, 1935. He has since resigned. Recently, after Xie Meisan, the chairman of the company from Yuyao, commissioned Sun Zhongyao, an accountant, to audit the accounts, it was discovered that Huang had inflated accounts and embezzled public funds totaling 5,014.32 yuan in national currency during his tenure. They hired lawyer Dai Jien and filed a lawsuit against Huang Shengchang in the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court for embezzlement, requesting that he be punished according to Article 336, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code, as well as filing an ancillary civil lawsuit, requesting that he be ordered to return 3,014.32 yuan (because he had already returned 2,000 yuan). Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng of the First Special District Court held a hearing in the 8th Criminal Court. The defendant Huang Shengchang arrived with his defense lawyer to respond to the lawsuit. After Xie Meisan stated the facts of the prosecution, the court questioned Huang Shengchang. As further investigation was required, he ordered a postponement of the hearing.</p>
<h3>Robbery at a Cigarette Paper Shop on Chang'an Road; Passerby Shot</h3>
<p>At approximately 1:00 AM yesterday morning, two robbers arrived at the Dafeng Cigarette Paper Shop at No. 424 Chang'an Road, under the jurisdiction of the Hengfeng Road Police Station in Zhabei. One robber was wearing a long blue cloth gown and a top hat, was tall, and had a dark complexion. The other robber was of medium height, had a square face, and a dark complexion. Each carried a 4-inch handgun. They pried open the back door and entered the room. At that time, everyone in the shop was asleep. The robbers immediately frightened them into silence, ransacked the boxes and chests, and stole 120 silver coins, 76,000 copper coins, one silk cheongsam, and over ten short shirts and trousers. After robbing, the robbers left the shop and attempted to escape. As they passed through the alley, Mao Shoufu, a man from Shaoxing who sold beef on Route Tenant de la Tour (now Tongfu Road) in the concession and lived at No. 21 in the alley, was returning home. Seeing one of the robbers looking flustered, Mao shouted "Catch the thief!", intending to arrest him. Unexpectedly, the robber fired several shots, one of which hit Mao's left arm, causing him to fall to the ground in pain. The robbers, realizing that they had caused trouble, fled. Yu Dongsen (52 years old, from Ningbo), the owner of the Dafeng Cigarette Paper Shop, and his neighbors heard the gunshots and went out to investigate, but the robbers were nowhere to be found. The victim prepared a list of the stolen items and rushed to report it to the Hengfeng Road Police Station. Chief Lu Peili, along with patrol officer Huang Zhenxiang and detectives Wu Zhongda, went to the scene to investigate. At the same time, they reported to the Inspectorate of the Public Security Bureau and ordered the detective squad to arrest the criminals and recover the stolen goods. Mao Shoufu, who had been shot, went to the Baolong Hospital on Rue Brenier de Montmorand (now Baike Road) in the concession for treatment. Fortunately, the injury was not critical and was not life-threatening.</p>
<h3>Tailong Flour Company Holds Extraordinary General Meeting</h3>
<p>The Tailong Flour Company was founded in the early years of the Republic of China and established a manufacturing factory in Wuxi. Its Eagle Ball and Dragon Boat brand flours are sold in major commercial ports at home and abroad and enjoy a good reputation. In 1931, it added new machines and increased capital for reorganization. However, it suffered heavy losses due to the impact of the Shanghai War. In January 1934, the shareholders' meeting resolved to instruct the board of directors to liquidate and end the company. However, due to the gradual decline in asset prices, the assets and liabilities were insufficient to offset each other, and it was even more difficult to find a suitable buyer due to the financial contraction. The liquidation process was difficult, so the factory had to be leased out to continue operations, using the rental income to pay off interest. It has been almost two years since then. On the morning of the 13th of last month, the factory's machine building, office, and other areas suddenly caught fire, and the machinery and equipment were completely destroyed. In addition to sending personnel to investigate and prepare a list of losses to claim compensation from the insurance company, the company held an extraordinary general meeting at its Shanghai office at No. 304 Tiantong Road at 3:00 PM on the 7th of this month. The key points of the decisions made are as follows: The shareholders elected Ye Shumei and Gu Yuxun as liquidators to handle all liquidation matters. The company will be dissolved after the liquidation is completed. In addition to sending the accounts to each shareholder for review, no further shareholders' meetings will be held.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the news item published in your newspaper on the 6th of this month about the damage to our company's steamship at sea, which stated that the ship was leased to a Japanese company and traveled to various ports in Japan and Europe, the facts are not in accordance with the actual situation. Our company's steamship "Hai Shang Lun" was leased to the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to operate on the South China route. After the lease ended in June last year, it was taken back and operated by ourselves. It is currently sailing in India and has never been leased to the Japanese Datong Company, nor has it traveled to European ports. We are writing to you accordingly, hoping that your newspaper will investigate and correct the report to clarify the truth and value public opinion. Sincerely, China Merchants Steamship Co., Ltd.

<p>— (Xiao Bai)</p>
<p>Life is inherently a battle.</p>
<p>Learning has no end. We live in this world and must strive to enrich ourselves daily to meet the needs of our lives, understand this world, and develop the ability to cope with all kinds of emergencies.</p>
<p>People have two kinds of education: one is received from others, and the other is obtained through self-study. The latter is actually more important than the former.</p>
<p>We must learn, learn, and learn again, because the more we learn, the more we discover our own ignorance and mistakes, and correct and improve ourselves.</p>
<p>We cannot overestimate ourselves, but we must not underestimate ourselves either. We must know that one person has no power, but two people are a little stronger. When many people unite together, that can bring about a qualitative change and unleash extraordinary power.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Mr. Yu Jianhua</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Alas, on the twentieth anniversary of the martyrdom of Mr. Chen Yingshi, Mr. Yu Jianhua, a pioneer of the Tongmenghui from my hometown of Taicang, passed away in Lidi. A genius of his generation was wasted by illness, unable to fulfill his ambitions to devote himself to the party and the group. He displayed extraordinary talent in writing, but ended his life in melancholy at the young age of fifty-two. His works include only the "Jianhua Collection," "The Legend of Pianhong," and "A Strange Book from the Wilderness," three titles in all. Mr. Yu had been ill for more than ten years, his children were young and weak, and his family was in poverty. Fortunately, he received assistance from Mr. Liu Yazi, Tao Xiaoliu, Ye Chucang, and Feng Xinxia, and his wife was virtuous and served him well, so that Mr. Yu was not troubled by trivial matters and his children did not miss a single day of school. Otherwise, the grass on Mr. Yu's grave would have been overgrown long ago. How could he have lived for another ten years and seen his children complete their studies? Mr. Yu's given name was E, his courtesy name was Jianhua, and his sobriquet was Yisu. He was a remarkable man from Loudong, skilled in poetry and unrestrained in drinking, and a talented member of the Nanshe. In his youth, Mr. Yu studied in Japan, working hard and striving for progress, and his studies were comparable to Meng Jin's. He later studied with Mr. Feng Xinxia at Aurora University, conspiring to destroy the stone statue of the Virgin Mary, which was disliked by the French. He then left and traveled around, to Shandong, Fujian, Guangdong, and Yan, and among the islands of Southeast Asia. Wherever he went, he associated with revolutionary patriots, and often contributed writings to revolutionary magazines. He also followed Mr. Chen Qubing, Liu Yazi, Gao Jiangong, and other gentlemen to the Nanshe, allying at the Zhang Gong Temple in Huqiu, Wuxian. Later, he taught poetry at Jinan University, but was frustrated and returned home due to illness, resting in seclusion in Yanshan, composing poems to express his feelings. He then commissioned a friend to paint a picture of "Dreaming and Chanting by a Small Window" to show his aspirations. However, in his youth, he traveled around with a staff, experiencing hardship and danger, and his spirit was heroic, like Fang Shanzhi discussing military affairs on horseback. Who knew that he would be debilitated by illness in less than twenty years! Initially, Mr. Yu suffered only from neurasthenia, then both hands twitched, and finally he suffered from total paralysis. However, his senses were not dulled. When guests visited him, his eyes would stare intently, and when asked a question, he would slowly utter one or two words after several minutes. His eating, living, and sleeping all depended on his wife. Alas, how bitter!</p>
<h3>Rotten Pears</h3>
<h3>A Shen Bao Newspaper from Twenty-Eight Years Ago</h3>
<p>— Choucheng</p>
<p>During the 30th anniversary celebration of joining the military held in Suzhou this time, all the comrades who attended sent various items used in the barracks thirty years ago to the meeting for display as a memento, and Huang Xinyi collected the most. In addition to the conscription handbook issued by the Changzhao Society in the thirty-second year of Guangxu, the congratulatory speech for welcoming new soldiers, and the salary sheet for the deputy squad leader of the left team of the first battalion of the second infantry regiment, and the exam papers for entering the army school, there was also a third sheet of this newspaper from the fifth day of the sixth month of the first year of Xuantong, because it was printed with a group photo of all the students of the 46th regiment's army school. At that time, this newspaper was still printed on one side with glossy paper. This photo was published on the second page of the third sheet, three inches high and five inches wide, very clear. Before the local news, there were eighteen characters above it: "Photography of the Fourth Semester of the Suzhou 46th Regiment Army School." The audience all regarded it as an antique and admired his meticulousness. At that time, the local news was divided into six columns: the inner city, the southern city, Zhabei, the British Concession, the American Concession, and the French Concession. There was a news item above: "Confiscating Morphine Syringes," which said, "Tian, the magistrate of this county, learned that in various villages in this county and at the borders of Fengxian, Qingpu, Huating, and Nanhui counties, some people were injecting morphine liquid syringes instead of opium. Ignorant people do not know the harm, only seeking temporary enjoyment, regardless of the poison entering their lungs and harming their lives in the future, which is very pitiful. Yesterday, he specifically ordered officials to go to the countryside and strictly arrest them to prevent future harm." Unexpectedly, after twenty-eight years, this kind of morphine syringe that harms people deeply has still not been completely banned, which is lamentable! There was also news about "Three Records of Fish Vendors' Strike," which said, "With the efforts of the directors of the Chamber of Commerce, it is hoped that it will be resolved. It is said that it will still follow the old rules and not change the foreign scale. As for the remaining follow-up measures, Yu Qiaqing, the observer, will issue a proper agreement within ten days and announce it again." It can be seen that Yu Qiaqing at that time was already mediating commercial disputes.</p>
<h3>The Cruelty of Wearing Animal Skins</h3>
<p>— Yimei</p>
<p>It is indeed a barbarian custom for people to wear animal skins. In ancient times, people did not know how to plant cotton and make clothes, so they hunted animals for their skins to keep warm. After Leizu invented silk and Huang Daopo created cotton, clothing was greatly improved, and there was no need for animal skins to decorate oneself. However, the habit was long-standing and not easily changed, and even now, fur coats are still highly valued. Yesterday, I heard Mr. Lu Shie say: "It is indeed a cruel act to cut and take animal skins, especially pearl skin grey rats. Pearl skin is not naturally like that. In the coldest days of winter, sheep are tied up and their hair is completely removed. Then they are pushed into the ice and snow. The sheep freeze to the extreme and tremble incessantly, and then fine hair grows into granular shapes, which is what is called pearl skin. Grey rats, also known as blue rats, are dark grey with white bellies and long, loose tail hair. They are agile and good at jumping. They are found in the mountains of Jilin. After they are caught, a red-hot iron skewer is inserted through the rat's anus. The rat is in great pain and struggles, and the oil seeps into the fur, giving it a luster when viewed. The sable is the most kind. Those who catch it take red arsenic in advance, lie naked in the snow. The sables know this and come to cuddle to keep warm. The naked person suddenly gets up and strangles them. Molten lead is forcibly poured into the sable's mouth. The sable is in extreme pain and rolls on the ground, and the oil also seeps out because of this." Therefore, although Mr. Lu wears fur coats, he absolutely does not wear pearl skin grey rat sable, he said.</p>
<h3>A New Nest for Phoenixes</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 2: A Beautiful Woman Leans on the Ripples of the Sky, a Good Dream Warmly Nurtured in the Moonlight of a Small Building</p>
<p>After he said this, he gave another knowing smile, took out the fountain pen he carried in his chest pocket, and densely wrote two lines of double circles next to the four words "lingering grievances of the remaining years." Then, he read the short story through, word by word. After reading it, he suddenly had some kind of feeling, and immediately searched through the bookshelves and cabinets, finding thirty or forty newly published magazines and placing them all on the table. The names of the magazines included "Spring Breeze," "Cuckoo's Voice," "Oriole's Song," and "Petals' Fragrance." The covers all featured extremely beautiful pictures. He randomly picked up a magazine and flipped through it wildly, looking for writings signed by "Yi Litian." He would look at the title and then, with the fountain pen, write the title in a very delicate English exercise book. After writing it down, he would flip through the second magazine. He searched through all the books, and then returned them to the bookshelves and cabinets. The English exercise book on the table, however, had quite a few words copied on it. He cleared the table, put the exercise book aside, and then took out a stack of red silk grid paper from the drawer, and used an ink brush to neatly transcribe the names of the novels from the exercise book again. Below each novel title, he wrote down which issue of the magazine it was published in, the total number of words, and what kind of content it was. He painstakingly copied for more than four sheets of paper. After he finished transcribing, he seemed pleased with himself, put down the pen, held the papers in his hands, and lay down next to a rattan chair to read, pondering the content of each novel. In his ears, he seemed to hear a slight rustling sound. When he looked up, it was the maid Xiao Ju, who had already entered the room. He asked, "Why are you being so sneaky? If you want to come in, just come in." Xiao Ju said with a smile, "I've come in two or three times. Miss was focused on copying books, and I didn't dare to disturb you." Menglan said with a smile, "You know that copying books shouldn't be disturbed." Xiao Ju said, "I don't know that. I see that Miss is putting all her energy into those books and papers. There must be some meaning to it." As she spoke, she couldn't help but smile. Menglan stood up, put the copied papers into a lecture folder, and said with a smile, "What are you smiling at?" Xiao Ju said, "The young mistress said that there are very interesting drum lyrics in these books. Miss, please tell me a few paragraphs one night." Menglan said, "Do you even know what drum lyrics are?" Xiao Ju said, "How could I not know? The young mistress also told me about 'The Jade Hairpin,' 'Three Smiles,' 'The Jade Dragonfly,' and 'Talented Scholars and Beautiful Ladies.' They're very interesting." Menglan said, "You even know about 'Talented Scholars and Beautiful Ladies.'" After saying this, she felt a great sense of emotion, so she rested her hands on her head and sat leaning against the back of the chair. When Xiao Ju saw her suddenly becoming sulky, she thought she had offended her with her words and left on her own. (32)</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Fish Market</h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>On a gloomy afternoon, I boarded the city ferry bound for the fish market.</p>
<p>The ferry left the double-layered pier amidst the noisy voices of the people, and the neon sign of the waterfront restaurant gradually disappeared before our eyes.</p>
<p>Sails fluttering, the river flowing leisurely; I stood on the deck, leaning on the railing, looking out at the outline of the metropolis, a dreamlike picture appearing before my eyes. The boat, gathering courage, moved forward, while many small boats and canoes cut through the surging waves, splitting the river surface, weaving back and forth like shuttles. The muffled whistles, like the braying of donkeys, made people's eardrums a little swollen. The gigantic imperial warships and merchant ships of Great Britain lay quietly in the heart of the river, revealing their hideous faces, like several man-eating demons!</p>
<p>An hour later, we had left the bustling center of the metropolis and passed through the factory area! Yangshupu; then, that milky yellow three-dimensional building vaguely appeared on the shore opposite Donggou Wharf. First, what we saw amidst the lush greenery was the national flag fluttering high in the sky; then came the eight large characters "Ministry of Industry Shanghai Fish Market."</p>
<p>I landed on the dock in front of me, where I met quite a few fashionable men and women who had come to visit.</p>
<p>Here, in addition to a very modern Western-style building, there was also a small vegetable market-style auction site. To the east was the fishing boat dock. At this time, more than a dozen fishing boats with bare masts were moored alongside the dock. Countless small iron rails were embedded horizontally and vertically on the dock and on the ground everywhere, for transporting fish away from the dock and to various places. There were three docks in total. The Western-style building housed the market office. The lower level had a small bank that specialized in lending capital to fishermen, named the Fisheries Trust Society Business Office. The fish market office had a total of five rooms, and other storage rooms, coolie rooms, telephone rooms, toilets, dining halls, etc. were all equipped. In addition to a general office on the second floor, there were also director's rooms, conference rooms, archive rooms, small offices, research rooms, libraries, technical rooms, supervisor's rooms, exhibition rooms, etc. The third floor was the staff dormitory and bathroom. The fourth floor was a terrace. The fifth and sixth floors had only one observation tower.</p>
<p>To the west of the auction site was the office of each broker—the fish shop—with a total of twenty-seven storefront rooms, each being the office of one broker. The business offices of the various fishing companies were on the second floor.</p>
<p>On the lower level were five large cold storage rooms, one ice-making room, two machine rooms, two manager's rooms, and several processing rooms; it is said that they could refrigerate a total of 1,500 tons of fish. The ice-making area was at the northernmost end.</p>
<p>The opening time for the auction was 3:30 AM, so when I went to visit, the market and office were quiet, only smelling a very unpleasant fishy odor.</p>
<p>Coming back, I went to Junpu Bureau Road for a week-long tour; there was a surveyor measuring on the side of the road, preparing to install small iron rails. There, the entire coast was a reed industry, and I saw many villagers picking reed chopsticks in the muddy reed fields, and there were quite a few men and women coming and going to the fish market.</p>
<p>Local Customs Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Japanese Confectionery Passed Down from Our Country</h3>
<p>— Jiyun</p>
<p>Confectionery is not fruit, but a kind of Japanese snack, similar to the mantou in our country. The inside is all purple bean paste, and the outside is wrapped in colored flour. It is red and green, very beautiful. Moreover, the style is not just round, there are all kinds. Japanese people call it "confectionery," but they still call our country's white mantou "mantou." But Japanese confectionery is also transformed from our country's mantou.</p>
<p>According to Japanese research, our country's mantou was invented in the Han Dynasty. "Origins of Things" records, "When Zhuge Liang conquered the south and was about to cross the Luzhu River, the local custom was to sacrifice to the gods with human heads. Liang ordered that sheep and pigs be used instead to take the dough human heads to sacrifice, and the name mantou began." At that time, China only had meat mantou, because it imitated the heads of barbarians, it was called barbarian head, and later it was transformed into mantou. "Seven Repair Drafts" records, "At first, it was written as barbarian head, starting from Zhuge Wuhou," which can prove it. Another saying is that mantou was originally called mantou, man meaning covered with dough, and tou being the first food in a banquet. Therefore, "Lu Chen's Sacrifice Method" has the sentence "spring shrine uses mantou." The two sayings do not say which is true, but it is undoubtedly created in the Han Dynasty.</p>
<p>The oldest mantou in Japan is the Shioze confectionery shop, which has a history of six hundred years. The first one to be introduced to Japan was Lin Jingyin from the Song Dynasty in our country. At that time, Zen Master Longshan of Kenninji Temple in Kyoto, Japan, entered the Song Dynasty, and Lin Jingyin returned to him as a disciple and went to Japan together, so there was Nara mantou. Lin Jingyin was a descendant of the hermit Lin Hejing. It is said that next to Lin Hejing's study, there was an anman tree. He imitated the shape of his fruit and made mantou, so the mantou of the Lin family at that time was famous.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyin married a wife in Japan and gave birth to two sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Mutou, became the founder of Ryosokuin in the Kenninji Temple Pagoda. The second son, Yuu Tenshu, changed to running a mantou business, opened in Kyoto's Karasuma Shijo Shimomachi, and was the founder of the Japanese confectionery shop. This place name is also commonly known as Mantouya-cho. Later, Yuu Tenshu's son, Shoban, went to our country to study for several years before returning to Japan and settling in Shioze Village. He changed his surname to Shioze, and Shioze mantou got its name from this.</p>
<p>During the Battle of Sekigahara in the Tokugawa era, Tokugawa Ieyasu used mantou placed in his helmet to worship heaven and earth and pray for victory. Therefore, there was also the name of Kabuto Mantou, and it became a food to reward the three armies. Japanese confectionery is completely used as a tea snack, so it has a close relationship with the tea ceremony. At that time, the noble class and the leisure class were very fond of the tea ceremony, so confectionery was valued along with it. Many elegant names were proposed, such as "Dancing Crane," "Hazy Night," and "Suhama," which are now famous confections.</p>
<p>Since the mantou business became popular, countless people imitated it. Although restrictions were agreed upon, there were still more than 200 shops in Kyoto City. Crude manufacturing and abuse were far from what they used to be. Tokyo was originally called Edo, and there was no such confectionery. It was not until Matsudaira Echizen-no-kami went to Saikyo and tasted the delicious mantou. So he specially went to Kyoto to summon a confectionery master to make it. Now there are confections everywhere in Japan. They are eating the mantou that was passed down from our country, or they still think it is a Japanese specialty.</p>
<p>In Chinese restaurants in Japan, because some of our Chinese students like to eat noodles, there are mantou and buns for sale. Not many Japanese are encouraged to eat it, because they always prefer sweet confections to meat mantou.</p>

<h3>My Country's World Games Football Team: European Tour Miscellany, Written and Sent by Li Huitang</h3>
<p>Arrival in Batavia</p>
<p>After our 4-0 victory over the Singapore Combined Team on September 14th, we set off the following afternoon on the Dutch mail ship "Plancius" towards Batavia, 500 nautical miles away. Teammate Cai Wenli, due to an important championship match involving the Singapore Chinese team, was delayed and only caught up with us three days later. The first half of this two-day, one-night voyage was quite comfortable, but later the weather changed, and the wind and waves became violent. At the final evening meal, less than half enjoyed it. Among them, Liang Rongzhao, Huang Meishun, Li Guowei, Chen Zhenhe, and others vomited incessantly. Most of the other friends were also depressed, huddling in their bunks. This sea route, which I have traveled more than ten times, had waves like I have not seen before. It could be said that the Dragon Palace was playing a prank. On the morning of the 17th, the Batavia harbor was already in sight. After the formalities of passport inspection by the immigration office, we disembarked in an orderly fashion. Welcoming us were the local community organizations, Deputy Consul Lin, and many people from the sports community. It was not lively, but it was not desolate either. After landing, we took cars into the city and checked into the Asia Hotel. At 11 o'clock, all the community organizations in Batavia held a welcome meeting at the Guang Zhao Public Hall, chaired by Consul General Song. The atmosphere was solemn. During the meeting, the chairman gave a welcoming speech, and Director Rong gave a speech of thanks. Then, a flag-presenting ceremony was held. The flag was inscribed with the eight characters: "Strive forward, win glory for the country." We accepted and were even more motivated. After the meeting, because of the oppressive heat and fatigue from the boat journey last night, we all stayed in our lodgings to rest, preparing to compete with the Batavia Combined Team, the champion of all the cities in Java, in the afternoon. (The match report will be recorded separately.) According to the schedule for the entire island of Java, we will stay for three weeks and play more than ten matches in various places. The schedule is tight, and from now on, the front line will become a time of many events. Batavia is the capital of the Dutch East Indies, where the governor resides. Commerce is thriving, making it a hub for transportation. Most of the Chinese are from Fujian and Guangdong, holding the reins of commerce. Many people say that if all the Chinese were to move out of the Dutch East Indies, the prosperity of the Dutch East Indies would plummet. This shows the position of our compatriots here. Four years ago, I lived here with my wife and children for eighteen months. I heard and saw a lot about the various local people. I know them quite well. The Dutch government's tax rate here is extremely harsh, but the politics are outstanding, and the city is peaceful. It is not like many places in our country, where taxes are heavy, and there are no achievements, leaving the people in deep water. The biggest exports of the entire island are sugar and coffee. The highways extend in all directions, making transportation convenient, which is unparalleled in the East. Except for Guowei and Jia Youliang, all of our team members have been here many times. Since 1929, the football teams from Hong Kong and Shanghai have come almost every year, leading the football craze on the island. Its popularity is far greater than in our country, and its spirit of progress is also very exemplary. Every year, they invite strong teams from Europe or East Asia to visit, in order to increase the benefits of mutual learning. Therefore, their technical progress has been rapid in recent years. Compared with our country's standing still, there is simply no comparison.</p>
<p>Narrow Victory Over the Batavian Selection</p>
<p>Last night, many felt uncomfortable due to the waves during the voyage. This morning (May 17th), we just landed on the mainland, rested for a few hours, and then competed with the Batavian Selection team, the champion of all the cities on the island, at 5 pm. We were cautious and nervous, fearing failure. At 4:30 pm, we arrived at the Kamit Budo Stadium, only to see a sea of people. The entire stadium was already in disarray due to the large number of people. After taking photos according to custom, we lined up and waited. Our team lineup is on the left. The result was a 2-1 victory, with Feng Jingxiang and Li Huitang each scoring one goal.</p>
<h3>Ten-Event Athletics Test: Zhang Lingjia Wins Championship with Total Score of 5154</h3>
<p>In the ten-event athletics test for the World Games preliminary selection, the participants were Zhang Lingjia, Zhou Changxing, and Cheng Mengping. Zhou Changxing had an advantage in the first half. The second half continued yesterday afternoon in the rain. The three competed extremely hard, but Zhou suffered a great loss in the discus throw. The javelin was his specialty, but because the field was too wet, it was difficult to display his strengths, resulting in a difficult situation to recover from. Cheng Mengping also lost a lot of points because he did not fully exert himself in the discus and 1500-meter events. Zhang Lingjia relied on good luck in the high jump and discus events to turn defeat into victory, scoring 5154 points to win first place. Second place went to Zhou Changxing, and third place to Cheng Mengping. The full results are listed on the left.</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>Second Half</p>
<p>Total Score</p>
<p>After the formations were completed, Consul General Song Faxiang of Xing started the kickoff ceremony. The Batavian selection team's football skills were good, and the two sides were evenly matched. The stalemate lasted for 25 minutes, finally broken by Feng, the center forward. Our goal was also repeatedly in danger. Before the break, Jiang Bai actually used his hand to slap the ball in a desperate attempt to save it, resulting in a penalty and conceding a goal, making it a draw. After changing sides, we replaced Chen Zhenhe and Sun Jinshun with Li Guowei and Zhuo Shijin, and the attack became more active. Soon, I (Li Huitang) scored a goal. Afterwards, our forwards pressed tightly, shooting several times, but their goalkeeper luckily saved them. Until the end of the match, we finally maintained the victory with a score of 2-1. It is gratifying that our team, after suffering from the wind and waves last night, was able to prevail against a strong enemy today. The performance of each player was without fault or praise. Among them, Ji Liangtian, Tian Sheng and Guowei received more praise from the audience. Most of the Batavian selection team were teammates of mine when I lived in Batavia. Among them, five or six represented the Dutch East Indies in the 10th Far Eastern Games in Manila. Their football skills were good, but judging from today's match, we should have won by more. Their goalkeeper's unexpected saves saved many sure-win balls, earning him much applause from the Dutch and local people. After today's match, we have to get up early tomorrow morning to take the train to Bandung.</p>

<h3>City Scout Convention: Camping Cancelled Yesterday Due to Rain; Troops Return Home, Curriculum Competition Rescheduled</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the third day of the 7th City Boy Scout Convention. The memorial week was scheduled for the morning, and the curriculum competition was scheduled for the afternoon. However, the weather did not cooperate. The wind and rain started the night before, and the campsite became a swamp, with mud everywhere, making it impossible to move. The boy scouts' clothes and shoes were soaked, and they were in a very embarrassing state. Therefore, Leng Xueqiao, the director of the convention affairs, convened a meeting of all troop leaders at the main office yesterday morning and decided that due to the weather conditions, camping had to be cancelled. The curriculum competition will be announced and rescheduled to be held at the City No. 1 Sports Field on Daji Road in the Nanshi area. Thus, the once grand convention came to a temporary end. The boy scout troops from various groups braved the rain to break camp, and the motor companies made three times their usual profit. Last night, the City Chamber of Commerce, Huacheng, Postal Workers, and Wusong Middle School troops stayed at the campsite. It was especially commendable that the City Chamber of Commerce and Wusong Middle School troops continued camping as a whole. The general office of the convention will continue to work at the campsite today, and will move back to the Nanshi Boy Scout Council office tomorrow. A reporter from the Guomin News Agency made a special trip to inspect the campsite last week. The following is a brief account of the campsite's behind-the-scenes stories.</p>
<p>Uninvited Guests Greatly Disappointed</p>
<p>On the night of the 7th, two masters of the wind graciously visited the venue as uninvited guests, causing all the boy scouts to frown. On the morning of the 8th, the masters were still reluctant to leave. The troop leaders were like ants on a hot pot, and held an emergency meeting. Of the thirty-six stratagems, breaking camp was the best policy. Otherwise, the children would catch a cold, and how would they take care of the aftermath? Therefore, it was decided to cancel camping and reschedule the competition. Everyone broke camp, greatly disappointed.</p>
<p>Non-stop Telephone and Constant Cars</p>
<p>With the decision to cancel camping, the troops prepared to leave. Therefore, the telephone specially installed for the convention was surrounded by people making calls. You called for moving trucks, and I called for passenger cars. From 5 o'clock to noon, the telephone did not stop. At the same time, in front of the city government, cars came and went constantly, never stopping. They came empty and left fully loaded.</p>
<p>Burning Down Camps in the Misty Rain</p>
<p>The boy scouts braved the rain to break camp, covered in mud. The cars were also slow in coming, and they were impatient while waiting. They sought pleasure in suffering, burning fires for fun. Therefore, the straw that they had slept on last night was subjected to a major fire robbery. For a while, the entire venue was ablaze, and the misty rain filled the sky, like a miniature of the burning of seven hundred miles of camps. It was also a special program of the convention.</p>
<p>Remaining Courage and Finding Happiness</p>
<p>The Shanghai Provincial No. 1 Middle School band is the only good military band in the city's boy scout community. It also played music during the grand review, and its melodious tunes were praised by the audience. Yesterday afternoon, almost all the troops had left, but they still held their old camp, blowing and broadcasting, crying and beating. It can be said to be the "finale" of the convention, not afraid of the wind and rain, drumming up their remaining energy, and finding their own fun in the tents.</p>
<p>Remaining Straw: A Scramble</p>
<p>The number of straw remaining at the campsite was still not small. The nearby poor people were very envious when they saw it. At first, they asked the boy scouts for it, but later they moved it in large numbers. The soaked, leftover straw was like a treasure. They grabbed it from each other, tied it up, and carried it away. It was an unexpected harvest, and the poor people benefited a little.</p>
<p>Actively Promoting the Bald Head Movement</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang advocated the New Life Movement, and the people in various places implemented the New Life Movement. The Zhenshi and Dagong schools in this city took the lead in the bald head movement. Those who heard the news and followed suit were still a small number. During this convention, Xie Yanbo and Yu Julu, the deputy general directors of the campsite inspection and command, believed that the bald head was indeed economical and hygienic, and could also show a spirit of courage. Therefore, they shaved their heads in public at the campsite. A certain boy scout from the Youth Association Middle School wielded the knife, so it did not cost a penny, which was extremely economical. It is a pity that no one followed them, letting the two of them enjoy the beauty alone.</p>
<h3>Copper Mountain Teachers Strike Due to Eight Months of Unpaid Salaries</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou, August 8th Dispatch) Copper Mountain teachers have been owed salaries for eight months. The Teachers' Association demanded salaries from the county government, but it has not been resolved. Starting from the 8th, all county-run schools will go on strike.</p>

<h3>Securities: Government Bond Prices Fluctuating</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the Chinese Securities Exchange's repeated debunking of rumors, public sentiment was relatively stable, leading to short covering by retail investors and a surge in prices. However, concerns arose due to the early three-week vacation for the education sector in Guangdong Province. Western newspapers continued to spread rumors, leading to a weakening trend. Major players continued to sell in the market, and the inventory of the Northwest Disaster Relief Association continued to flow out, absorbing cash and buying foreign exchange, leading to a continuous outflow of cash.

Japanese merchants have no intention of selling after several batches of fine cloth were opened at the beginning of this month. The atmosphere in the market is quite good, and the selling price of fine cloth is slightly higher by 1.5 fen per piece. The reasons for the sluggish sales of cotton cloth recently are, first, the busy farming season, and second, the summer goods have been fully stocked, and the autumn goods have not yet appeared, so it is the time of the interregnum, but the dark-colored cotton cloths of the long-distance Sichuan and Yunnan gangs have been developed, and they will continue to see prosperity, so the demand for fine cloth and fine twill cloth is gradually increasing.

<p>The Jinzhen dish, the Guangxi and Guangdong markets have stagnated, and there is no color at all. The current market is that the market goods all have the intention to sell off, and the selling disk is extremely chaotic, and there is hardly any market worth speaking of. If ordinary goods have already been entered for 20 yuan, after this, it must wait for the Cantonese sales to resume, and there will be a hope of turning to Su.</p>
<h3>Nanning Fennel New Goods Registered</h3>
<p>Fennel recently because the domestic Nanning goods have already seen new, the head plate has been opened for 27 yuan, which is much cheaper compared to the old goods, so the market situation is very tired, the old goods have all fallen, and it is difficult to return for a while.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Both Red and Green Tea Sales are Booming; Zhengzhou "Shrimp Eye" Tea Opens at 80 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sources of red and green tea for foreign firms were very abundant. Imports from the Yangtze River and Hangzhou routes arrived, with over 8,000 boxes of Qimen, Fuliang, and Zhide black tea arriving. A total of over 9,400 boxes of green tea from Sui'an, Tunxi, and Pingshui areas arrived. Sales varied slightly among the firms. "Tunzhen" moved slightly, with prices ranging from 82 to 90 yuan. Zhengzhou "Zhenmei" has not yet formally opened for sale, but "Shrimp Eye" tea, opened by Tongfu, is priced at 80 yuan. Some transactions were also made in "Needle Eyebrow" tea. However, because ships carrying "Core-Drawn Zhenmei" tea have already departed, the prices offered by foreign firms are lower, resulting in few transactions. Yushan "Zhenmei" tea, opened by Tianyu, is priced at 60 yuan. Transactions of other domestic firms' "Zhenmei" or "Core-Drawn" tea are also rare. Regarding Pingshui tea, Yongfa split two batches yesterday. One batch of "First Grade, Number Three Pearl Tea" was priced at 60, 46, and 38 yuan. The other batch of "First Grade, Numbers Three, Four, and Five Pearl Tea" was priced at 61, 48, 36, and 31 yuan. However, it is reported that these two batches are not formal large batches and cannot be considered formal market prices. As for Qimen black tea, the market transactions were still active yesterday, but only Jardine Matheson was actively sourcing for British firms. Other firms were not as enthusiastic, and the market price continued to shrink by more than ten yuan. The total transactions of red and green tea in the city amounted to more than 6,400 boxes, with no significant changes in the situation.</p>
<h3>Matte Artificial Silk in Short Supply</h3>
<p>Local firms are purchasing new shipments of Tianjin "Hai Ze" labeled goods that can be transferred to the inland. Eighty-six boxes of "Sky Bridge" brand, 120 count, are priced at 392 yuan. Over twenty boxes have been sold today, priced at 415 to 420 yuan. Hangzhou firms are also purchasing dozens of boxes of Italian goods, 120 count "Sni Ai," priced at 120 yuan for Number Two and 210 yuan for Number Three, excluding tax. Japanese firm Dongmian Yoko has transacted over ninety boxes of spot goods, 120 count "Billiard Room" and "Goldfish" brands, priced at over 390 yuan, purchased by several large local firms. Spot goods of 150 count matte silk are also in short supply. Yesterday, "Dragon" brand was priced at 350 yuan, with only a few boxes remaining.</p>
<h3>Yokohama Silk Prices Rise by 10 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the New York silk market was closed due to the weekend. The Yokohama silk market rose slightly, with spot goods selling at 647 yuan, a rise of 10 yuan compared to last Saturday. There were no transactions in forward contracts. The local silk market had only a few transactions, with Xinfu, Yongxing, and other firms importing fifty packages of white factory and gray warp silk.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Shantou Firms Purchase Large Quantities of Tinplate</h3>
<p>Shantou firms have recently started canning various fruits, creating a strong demand for tinplate. Despite the rain, over six hundred boxes were transacted, including two hundred boxes of 90-pound British goods, priced at 19 yuan and 25 cents; one hundred boxes of 180-pound American tinplate, priced at 39 yuan and 75 cents; and the rest were 100-pound French and German goods, with French goods at 40 yuan and German goods at 40 yuan and 5 cents.</p>

<h3>Two Red Peaches (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Fan Shou</p>
<p>During my illness these past few days, what disappointed me most were the daily "antipyretic injections." Normally, I have a considerable faith in these kinds of antipyretic injections. When I encountered friends and relatives with minor fevers, using them always had nine effective results out of ten, remarkably effective. But when I used them on myself, the magic weapon failed. During the three days of high fever, each day after the injection, my body temperature actually increased by one and a half degrees. I can only say that the antipyretic injections were not lucky on my body. Of course! It is definitely not the case that antipyretic injections would increase body temperature. Undoubtedly, it was because the time of the injection was precisely when my "fever" was most severe.</p>
<p>Conversely, there were also things that satisfied me during these few days of illness. The thing that satisfied me most was an ice pack. On the second night of high fever, because I could think of no other way, I finally thought of using an ice pack. Sure enough! It must have been the time for the ice pack to have good luck. After using it, it immediately made me feel less faint and painful, and my mind was clear. Even more remarkably, after applying it for an hour, the fever actually dropped by about two degrees. Placing an ice pack on the head of a patient with a high fever can make the mind clearer; this is a natural principle and can be said to be understandable. But to say that it can reduce fever may not be consistent with the facts, right? After I used it, the fever dropped. This may have been a coincidence: the time of using the ice pack happened to coincide with the time when the body temperature was dropping. So, although the decrease in body temperature after using the ice pack is a fact, it cannot be denied that it was a coincidence.</p>
<p>However, applying an "ice pack" during periods of high fever is indeed a very reasonable and "kingly way" to reduce fever. Our people can greatly adopt it and should not be doubted by the mystical sayings of old doctors.</p>
<p>Originally, tonsillitis is not considered a particularly serious disease; it is mostly a symptom of many diseases. However, when it happened to me, it lasted a full week, with high fever for three or four days. Among tonsillitis cases, it can be considered a severe one. Why is it more severe when it happens to me? This may have something to do with my usual constitution, being healthy and rarely sick. In general, healthy and strong people are rarely sick on weekdays, so when they get sick, it is often more severe than others. This is indeed the case: for example, with typhoid fever, if the patient is healthy and strong, it is often more severe than in ordinary people. What's the reason? Is it because healthy people are usually less likely to be infected by minor pathogens, and when they do get sick due to infection, it proves that the pathogenicity of the few pathogens is particularly fierce and powerful? — We can only observe it as such.</p>
<p>Now, the tonsillitis is completely cured, and the "red peaches" have disappeared without a trace. If you ask: What medicine cured it? I can't answer. If I were to answer, I would have to say: My own body cured it. So the main credit for this recovery should still go to my own body. For example, during the high fever, injections and medicines were not effective. At least it can be said that the effect was not obvious. Later, after a certain period, the fever went away on its own. Isn't this self-healing function a function of the body itself? From then until the complete recovery, it was all like this: it didn't rely on any medicine, but on the troops mobilized within my own body! (Whole-body reaction) The merit of fighting the enemy hard! If we were to talk about the function of medicine, then, for ailments like my tonsillitis this time, at most it can only occupy the position of a few quartermaster soldiers in the army.</p>
<p>However, in some special diseases, the function of medicine is still very significant. It is indispensable. Its effectiveness is no less than Guan Yu's Azure Dragon Crescent Blade or Zhang Fei's eighteen-foot spear! Therefore, treating all medicines as insignificant logistics soldiers is also a wrong view!</p>
<p>So, how did I treat this bout of tonsillitis with medication?</p>
<p>My use of medication was very simple. When I started to have a slight fever and my throat was slightly red, I treated it as a cold with some throat inflammation. I prescribed 25cc of castor oil to clear my bowels, used some mouthwash for my throat, and also used a mild antipyretic. The next day, seeing that the condition had not improved but had worsened, I decided to abandon all medicines and conduct an investigation. The most important test was a blood test. So I took my blood to be tested to see if there were any pathological changes. At this time, I asked Dr. Sha here to take charge of the diagnosis. His idea was also to wait for the blood test report before making a decision. At present, we can only wait and do not need to use any medicine, nor should we use medicine indiscriminately. On this day, in addition to local throat antiseptic tablets and antiseptic mouthwash, I had an antipyretic injection at night due to the high fever. (This type of antipyretic injection can be used safely for various infectious fevers; it can be said that this type of "universal fever-reducing injection" is still the right medicine for ailments like tonsillitis.) But in the end, I was very disappointed! When I got the injection, it was 39 degrees, and an hour later, the fever had not subsided but continued to rise, reaching 40 degrees. Didn't this antipyretic injection of mine fail to "reduce fever" at all? — No, if I hadn't gotten this injection, my fever might have risen even higher, perhaps reaching 41 degrees! When medicine enters the body and does not show immediate results, we can only interpret it as follows:</p>
<p>The blood test report came! No malaria parasites, white blood cell count of 6,200, and very little left shift of white blood cells. With this, we can know: It is definitely not malaria. Second, suspected typhoid fever is also very unlikely because the white blood cell count in typhoid fever is usually much lower. (The number of white blood cells in ordinary infectious fevers always increases, but only typhoid fever decreases compared to ordinary people, which is an important characteristic!) At the same time, if it is typhoid fever, the left shift of white blood cells will also increase significantly. So, according to the blood test results, typhoid fever is very unlikely. At that time, I was greatly relieved about the suspected illness (typhoid fever) that I had been worried about in advance.</p>
<p>During the following two days of high fever, the medication used was roughly the same; or rather, no special medicines were used at all. Locally, needless to say, I still used some throat disinfectant. "Antipyretic injections" were given as usual, one injection per day because this is something that is guaranteed to be harmless. Even if the "benefit" is not obvious, the harm is always absolutely guaranteed to be absent. The oral antipyretic was not used at all during the days of high fever, except for a little on the last day. Why did I always avoid using antipyretics to reduce my high fever? The reason is still fear of typhoid fever! Although the blood test report clearly stated that it was not like typhoid fever, my body temperature only differed by one or two degrees, and it did not completely subside. Especially when I had a high fever of 39 or 40 degrees, my pulse did not increase in parallel with my body temperature, and it remained between 80 and 90 beats per minute. This made me unable to completely ignore the one or two points of suspicion that it was still typhoid fever. (This is also a characteristic of typhoid fever! The patient's pulse does not increase in parallel with body temperature. In ordinary fever patients, when the body temperature reaches 39 or 40 degrees, the pulse per minute is always above 100, even as high as 120 or 130 beats; but typhoid fever patients are different: even if their body temperature rises to 40 degrees, the pulse per minute mostly remains between 80 and 90 beats. — Of course, there may be exceptional cases.)</p>
<p>It is not advisable to use antipyretics frequently in patients with typhoid fever. Some people probably do not understand this reason. Here, I will explain it briefly. Everyone knows that typhoid fever has a certain course of time. The fever period of an ordinary typhoid fever is four weeks. This, of course, refers to a purely simple typhoid fever. If other ailments are mixed in, resulting in so-called "complications," then the time will have to be extended. Just the time for a simple typhoid fever is already quite long. During these four weeks, the typhoid bacteria are wreaking havoc in the human body for four weeks, causing inflammation for four weeks. During this time of inflammation and havoc, the human body will naturally produce a defensive and resistant phenomenon. This phenomenon is increased body temperature, which is "fever." When a country is attacked by an enemy, it cannot avoid mobilizing troops to resist the foreign enemy. When the human body is attacked by pathogens, the inside of the human body must also mobilize troops to show resistance and kill the enemy. The so-called increase in body temperature is a representation of the human body mobilizing troops to resist and fight when it is attacked by pathogens. In typhoid patients, the consumption of the whole body's nutrition under this several weeks of mobilization of troops and high fever reaction is very considerable; at the same time, the work of the heart is also exceptionally hard. The positive effect of antipyretics is temporary fever reduction, but its side effect is harming the heart! If antipyretics are used for the high fever of typhoid patients, the effect is very weak. After use, it may drop slightly temporarily, but because of the disease itself, it will soon return and rise again, which is of no help. However, the patient's heart has already suffered great harm. If used too much, on the one hand, the heart is already very tired and overworked due to the long-term fever, and on the other hand, it is stimulated by everything, making the heart weaker. Eventually, there will be a time when it cannot bear the burden, and at this time, it can only announce a strike and move toward a state of collapse. The reason why antipyretics should not be used for typhoid patients is that they do not have the benefit of reducing fever but have the harm of hurting the heart. The reason why I never used antipyretics during the days of high fever was also to be careful, so as to avoid being harmed "in case" something happened. (End)</p>
<h3>Precautions and Prevention During Eye Disease Season</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zi Fu</p>
<p>Late spring and early summer are the season for eye diseases. Dust in the city and pollen in the countryside ride the strong winds of early summer, floating in all directions, eager to find a place to rest on people's clothes, hair, or skin. As a result, the chances of eyes being harmed are particularly high. Every year during this period, there are more eye disease patients, which is indeed good evidence.</p>
<p>Wind is indeed a major enemy of the eyes. Due to the stimulation of strong winds, it is very easy to cause minor problems such as eye congestion or tearing. This is not a major concern. However, the arrival of wind is inevitably accompanied by dust. Once it enters the eyes, it is very easy to cause illness. Therefore, during this season, people who already have chronic eye diseases are prone to worsening of their conditions, and people with healthy eyes are also prone to various eye diseases during this period. Therefore, people who already have conjunctivitis or other eye diseases should pay special attention and it is best to go to a doctor for examination and thorough treatment from time to time. However, prevention beforehand is better than treatment afterwards. Therefore, the best approach for people with healthy eyes is to pay attention to prevention in order to safely pass through this eye disease season.</p>
<p>Eye diseases caused by strong winds mixed with large amounts of dust are primarily conjunctivitis. Indeed, sometimes you get lucky and only get simple conjunctivitis from this kind of stimulation, which is considered good luck. If bacteria are mixed in with the dust and enter the eyes, it is very easy to develop acute conjunctivitis (epidemic eye disease), with more severe eye diseases such as eye congestion, tearing, and swelling. Especially in the countryside, if pollen flies into the eyes, it will immediately cause conjunctivitis.</p>
<p>Another point is that whenever wind blows dust into the eyes, tears will come out. At the same time, people who lack hygiene knowledge will naturally use their hands to wipe their eyes. As a result, the bacteria attached to the dirty fingers will be transmitted into the eyes, which can easily cause epidemic eye diseases or styes. The so-called stye,</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>also known as a "pig sty" or "eyelash sore," is caused by bacteria entering the hair root of the eyelash and causing suppuration.</p>
<p>So, how can we defend ourselves against the harm of wind and dust? A relatively easy way is for people who don't usually wear glasses to wear glasses during this time. Of course, just wearing glasses is not enough. It is best to wash your eyes carefully with clean, cold water when you return from going out. The method is to use cotton or a clean towel dipped in cold water in a washbasin to gently wipe the eyes separately. Doing this can have two effects: first, it washes away the impurities attached to the eyes and surroundings. Second, it is also a good cold compress that lowers the temperature of the eyes to eliminate eye congestion caused by wind and dust irritation.</p>
<p>In addition, it is important to pay close attention to washing your hands before washing your eyes, so as not to rub your eyes with dirty hands. Also, when traveling on the street and encountering dust flying into your eyes, do not panic and rub your eyes indiscriminately. When dust enters the eyes, it will naturally stimulate the production of a large amount of tears, which is a natural way. Because once tears flow out, they will naturally wash away and remove the dust. If we rub it indiscriminately, the dust will be forced to pierce in all directions and penetrate deeper, which is truly asking for trouble. If the dust is not easy to remove, you should go to a doctor for examination when necessary.</p>
<p>Also, when tears flow out with dust, use a clean handkerchief to gently wipe it away. Avoid rubbing your eyes with unclean hands, because this is not only useless but also has many harms.</p>
<h3>Domestic Medicinal Plants (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>Rubia cordifolia, L. var. Mungista, Mig.</p>
<p>(Plant) Grows wild in the mountains and fields. It is a perennial creeping plant. The roots are yellowish-red, hence the name "Rubia." The stem is square and has barbs. The leaves are in whorls of four, with long petioles and pointed oval shapes, with three to six main ribs. Conical cymes emerge from the leaf axils, and white five-petaled flowers bloom in autumn. The berries are spherical and turn black when ripe.</p>
<p>(Ingredients) Among the components of this plant, the only one that has been definitively proven is Purpurin C6H4＜　＞C6H(OH)3 (1.2.4).</p>
<p>(Medicinal Uses) It is said that Rubia roots can be used as a medicine to promote menstruation for women. They can also be used as a hemostatic for hemoptysis (coughing up blood), epistaxis (nosebleeds), and hematuria (blood in urine). They also have antipyretic and tonic effects. The dosage is 8 grams, decocted.</p>
<p>(Other Uses) The roots can be used as a dye, but this is rarely done today.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Questions and Answers About Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(83) Acute Generalized Miliary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>(Tuberculosis miliaris acuta)</p>
<p>Q: What is acute generalized miliary tuberculosis?</p>
<p>A: This is a disease in which a person who already has tuberculosis suddenly develops miliary tuberculous nodules all over the skin with chills and high fever. It is caused by tuberculous bacteria entering the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Q: Why does tuberculosis suddenly develop into this kind of disease?</p>
<p>A: It is mostly because the body suddenly encounters a weakening trigger. Such as suffering from acute infectious diseases, pregnancy and puerperium, mental and physical overwork, bone and joint and gland tuberculosis, etc.</p>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms of acute generalized miliary tuberculosis?</p>
<p>A: It usually starts with chills and high fever, sometimes accompanied by headache, vomiting, or other gastrointestinal symptoms. The fever type is often continuous or remittent. Chills and shivering recur repeatedly during the course. The pulse is rapid, and the blood pressure decreases.</p>
<p>Q: What are the respiratory symptoms in people with this disease?</p>
<p>A: Respiratory symptoms include cough (dry cough), sputum, shortness of breath, cyanosis. The lung area is tympanitic and dull on percussion, emphysema; in the late stage, there is no breathing sound.</p>
<p>Q: Are there any neurological symptoms?</p>
<p>A: The neurological disorders initially complain of severe headache, tinnitus, and dizziness, and later become unstable, delirious, and drowsy. Eventually, symptoms resembling meningitis appear (that is, neck stiffness, Kernig's sign, cutaneous hyperesthesia, convulsions, vomiting, slow pulse, etc.). However, the cerebrospinal fluid is transparent, and the pressure is increased. Tuberculous bacteria can be demonstrated in the cerebrospinal fluid.</p>
<p>Q: In addition to the symptoms described above, what other symptoms do miliary tuberculosis patients have?</p>
<p>A: Other symptoms that are unique to this disease are evidence of miliary tubercles on the fundus retina. The gastrointestinal tract is also impaired, with loss of appetite, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea. Proteinuria is present in the urine. Tuberculous bacteria can be demonstrated in the blood.</p>
<p>Q: What are the clinical forms of this disease?</p>
<p>A: Roughly speaking, there are three types: meningeal type, pulmonary type, and typhoid type.</p>
<p>Q: How to diagnose acute miliary tuberculosis?</p>
<p>A: As long as it is determined from the past history whether there is tuberculosis, tachycardia, shortness of breath, cyanosis, neurological symptoms; and fundus examination to see if there is retinal tuberculosis rash. X-rays can be taken of the lungs to see if there are fine spots.</p>
<p>Q: What diseases should it be distinguished from?</p>
<p>A: It should be distinguished from typhoid fever, septicemia, acute pneumonia, meningitis, pulmonary tuberculosis, malaria, etc.</p>
<p>Q: What is the prognosis of this disease?</p>
<p>A: Absolutely grim. Death usually occurs within two or three weeks.</p>
<p>Q: Is there a treatment method?</p>
<p>A: There is simply no treatment to speak of. Only symptomatic use of drugs to alleviate the patient's pain or use of drugs to maintain heart strength, stop coughing, and relieve pain.</p>
<h3>Common Sense of Hygiene for Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Diseases</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(90) Pupil</p>
<p>The normal pupil is in the center of the iris. Usually, the left and right are the same size and are perfectly round. If we try to shine light obliquely into the pupil area, it will appear black. If we try to shine light completely through it, it will appear red. Sometimes the left and right pupils are not regular; in medicine, this is called pupillary deformity. This type of deformity is often seen in posterior synechia following iritis, traumatic iris rupture, spinal cord tabes, and cerebral syphilis, etc. If a part of the iris is missing, the pupil can form a long oval shape. Generally, those with a defect in the upper part are often caused by iridectomy. Those in the lower part are often congenital iris defects.</p>
<p>The size of the pupil can be accurately measured with a Haab's pupillometer. Physiologically, it varies according to the intensity of the light, refractive state, adjustment action, convergence reaction, and age, etc. Usually, the pupils of young people are larger. The pupils of newborns and the elderly are smaller.</p>
<p>In physiological state, the diameter of the pupil is two to four millimeters. If the diameter of the left and right pupils differs by more than one millimeter, it is a pathological phenomenon. In medicine, this is called anisocoria. This is often encountered in refractive abnormalities, glaucoma, paralysis of the internal eye muscles, monocular visual impairment, and central nervous system disorders, etc.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (94)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>How young people with a predisposition to tuberculosis should choose their occupations is also an important issue in prevention and deserves to be mentioned here. Common opinion is that since the body is already weak, the chosen occupation should be easy and require little labor, such as teachers, officials, and writers. This is completely wrong. Because these people generally have strict working hours and find it difficult to consider physical fatigue, or they are constantly working at their desks all day, and the opportunity to contact fresh air and sunlight is far less than those who work outdoors. Therefore, for these young people, it is better to choose outdoor work such as agriculture, horticulture, and forestry. Because at least, there are many opportunities to enjoy sunlight and air; this is beneficial for life and cannot be achieved by the former. Regarding the occupation of a doctor, because of a deep understanding of the relationship, many people also pay attention to this; in fact, doctors cannot be separated from patients every day, and the opportunity to induce the disease is the most, so it is certainly not very appropriate!</p>
<p>Finally, there is another question to be raised, that is, whether young people with tuberculosis are suitable for exercise? Our answer is: appropriate physical exercise is certainly permissible and is not without benefit. However, the vigorous exercises currently promoted in schools, such as wrestling, football, long-distance running, and boxing, can cause excessive fatigue, and as a result, latent tuberculosis can easily become progressive, and hemoptysis is even more common, so it is absolutely impossible to take risks and try them. This is a major issue in national education, and it is hoped that domestic educators will pay attention to this and not blindly encourage it. (The End)</p>
<p>Since this article has been published in journals, readers have repeatedly inquired about the date of publication or requested that it be printed as a single book in advance. The "Anti-Tuberculosis Magazine" has also reprinted it on a regular basis, and the kindness and affection are beyond expectations. However, the author has difficulties, with medical and teaching duties, and very little time to write, so it has been delayed until today to be able to complete the manuscript; it is now planned to revise the original text once and then send it to the printer, and it should be published in June at the latest. I would also like to take this opportunity to inform you of this. The author has not been able to reply to all the letters from you due to work, and I apologize for this.</p>
<h3>Q&amp;A on Dental Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Treatment of Dental Diseases</p>
<p>Section 1: General Overview</p>
<p>(Question 159) Why should dental diseases be treated earlier than other diseases?</p>
<p>Answer: Most of the cells in our body have the ability to repair themselves, so ordinary diseases will gradually recover after a while. However, once a problem occurs with teeth, it will only get worse and worse, and there is little hope of natural repair. It must be treated and repaired artificially before the condition can be stopped. The later the treatment, the greater the loss and the more difficult the repair. Moreover, no matter how clever the artificial repair is, it is not as good as the natural one.</p>

<h3>Advice to Students in Beiping Not to Demonstrate</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent</p>
<p>The Hebei-Chahar Political Council issued an order on the 3rd prohibiting student strikes, stating that according to past experience, strikes often occur at the time of the semester or when students are about to take exams. Students often use strikes to avoid exams. If students in various universities or other schools attempt to strike, they will be arrested or expelled. I am not very supportive of student demonstrations, but it is probably not true to say that students only want to avoid exams and use the opportunity to demonstrate. If they use the opportunity, there must be a reason to use it. It is the misfortune of the country that students have to use the opportunity to demonstrate. Although it is unavoidable that there are students who want to avoid exams by using the opportunity, I think these students are only a small minority.</p>
<p>However, since I do not approve of student demonstrations in fact, there is no need to discuss them in theory. Let me briefly mention two points: Student demonstrations are commonplace. Has there ever been a time when they did not end in a tragic result? As the saying goes, "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country." Patriotism is common to all. Precisely because patriotism is common to all, students do not need to demonstrate alone. Do students have patriotism while others do not? If we talk about responsibility, the government's responsibility is after all ten or a hundred times greater than the students' responsibility. Therefore, the government's patriotism should also be ten or a hundred times greater than that of the common people. Why should students seek trouble for themselves and do something that is beyond their duty? Students' responsibility lies in studying. If they do not succeed in their studies, it is the shame of the students. If the country wants to be rich and strong, it can only rely on science. If science does not progress, it is also the shame of the students. Whether the country is currently in turmoil and needs science to save the country, or in times of peace and prosperity, when there is no external disaster, it can only rely on science to strengthen itself. Therefore, students should now work ten or a hundred times harder than usual. Moreover, the current war is a war of science. No matter how students shout with their bare hands, it is not enough to help. Even if the whole country uses its strength to resist, it may not help the situation. Moreover, what kind of situation is North China in? Students are under such immense pressure that they have almost no room to breathe. Is there still a possibility of struggle?</p>
<p>Even so, we people who do not live outside the pass or in North China have seen few shocking things. Even if we do see them, it is only a glimpse in the newspaper or a story from a friend. It is still possible to say a few calm and sarcastic words while watching the fire from across the river, before it burns our eyebrows. If we were already in this kind of strange organization, I am afraid there would be no room for talk. Should the general public still demonstrate? Students! You should work hard in your studies and repay the country in the future.</p>
<h3>Encounter</h3>
<p>— Bai Ling</p>
<p>Once, my father took my mother, brother, and me back to our home from Jinan.</p>
<p>It was in the spring, and the weather was already warm. The mouth of the Yellow River, which had been frozen, began to melt under the caress of the sun.</p>
<p>To avoid the ravages of floods, my family had moved countless times, but no matter how we moved, we could not avoid being disturbed by the water. This time, we moved to a house on the back ridge not far from the river embankment.</p>
<p>Whenever spring came, people would be stirred by the indelible memories, and they would begin to live a life of worry and unease.</p>
<p>The yellow and turbid river water flowed like the open mouth of a man-eating demon, raging! Roaring! Plains, mountains, villages, and human figures had been washed away and swallowed by its flood waves several times!</p>
<p>Some people could save their lives from the disaster, but most of them became wanderers in other places, or they took the risk and became heroic bandits.</p>
<p>Not long after we lived at home, we encountered the river water rising again. So, my grandfather anxiously asked my father to take us away from home as soon as possible. But he stubbornly refused to go with us, and he was willing to stay at home. He said that when the water was high, he could find a way to run. He was a really stubborn old man. He had been a hardworking and loyal farmer all his life.</p>
<p>The next day, before dawn, my father took my mother, brother, and me on a journey. It was drizzling. My grandfather put us on the sedan car and walked with us for a while on the dark road. With a reluctant expression, he murmured in a prayerful tone: "I hope God will bless you and keep you safe on the road!"</p>
<p>Seeing my grandfather's unusual sadness, my father couldn't help but say, "I think we should go together. You don't have to stay at home alone."</p>
<p>My grandfather covered his lips with his hand and said hesitantly, "Don't worry about me..." Then, he walked back despondently.</p>
<p>On the road, our hearts felt inexplicably sad! When we arrived at Taiping Town, the sun was already red, and we were a little happy. After eating something on the road, we continued to walk.</p>
<p>Just as we arrived at Wangjiagou, the driver turned his head in panic and said to my father, "The front, the front, the front is not good, there is trouble ahead! I saw a car rolling over on the ground from a distance."</p>
<p>"Then, quickly, quickly, quickly turn back!" My mother was stunned.</p>
<p>"Or we can also walk south..." My father seemed to have some experience, and he glanced around.</p>
<p>My brother and I were so frightened that we almost cried.</p>
<p>The driver followed my father's instructions and changed direction, walking on a road to the south. But not far away, eight rough men jumped out of a ditch beside the road. They held wooden sticks in their hands and rushed towards us. "Stop! The car in front. Hand over the money quickly!" Some voices shouted excitedly.</p>
<p>My father was afraid that they would hurt us, so he hurriedly jumped out of the car and said tremblingly, "Brothers, we are poor travelers, and we don't have much money with us, just a few travel expenses..." As he spoke, he rummaged through the few old clothes bags placed in the car for them to see. Then, he took out a paper package from one of the clothes bags: "These few dollars..."</p>
<p>A person standing next to my father stared straight at him, and at the same time, my father was touched by his gaze and began to search him. The man looked embarrassed, smiled, and said to my father with a red face, "You, you, you don't recognize me!"</p>
<p>My father grunted and stared blankly.</p>
<p>The man said again, "I, I am Lao Liu from Dongzhuang, don't you remember? I used to work as a farmhand in your back neighborhood."</p>
<p>My father smiled, clapped his hands on his thighs and said, "Ah, I remember. I said Lao Liu, you, you are now..."</p>
<p>"I can't make a living now... In recent years, there have been floods, and there have been wars and chaos. Who would hire me as a farmhand again..."</p>
<p>So, my father held out a paper package in his hand and said, "I said, Lao Liu, we are all acquaintances, so, you take these few dollars and everyone have a pot of wine, okay?"</p>
<p>He pushed my father's hand away and said politely, "How can this be done? No need, no need, you are travelers, and you can't move a step without money!"</p>
<p>This unexpected panic allowed us to pass safely.</p>
<p>My father put the few dollars back into the clothes bag.</p>
<p>My mother looked at my father and said calmly, "Lao</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Liu wasn't a very honest person, was he? He has learned to be bad now!"</p>
<p>My father coughed a few times, as if he hadn't heard my mother's words. He was gazing at the wide, yellow, and turbid river in the distance.</p>
<h3>Slaughterhouse</h3>
<p>— Meng Hua</p>
<p>It was an early summer afternoon. I was returning from the Xishi Market in Tianqiao and wanted to walk towards Qianmen Street when, somehow, I lost my way and ran into an unknown alley. On both sides of the alley were some low and dilapidated houses. The white ash painted on the outside had faded completely, and the yellow mud, grass roots, and broken bricks were all exposed. I boldly walked past, but gradually I found such wooden signs and paper strips:</p>
<p>"Lanfang's place for business"</p>
<p>"Yueyuehong two maos at your service"</p>
<p>"Tianlu just arrived, Xiaoguixiang two maos at your service, guaranteed to satisfy you"</p>
<p>The latter paper strip was pasted outside a small house with peeling paint. At that time, the door was open, and behind the old red lacquer screen, I saw some naked women sitting around a square table in the courtyard. A young man was squatting under the screen, staring at me with fierce eyes. I was a little scared and hurriedly ran past.</p>
<p>This alley was only narrow, but not long. In front was a huge pile of garbage, and turning from there might be a main road, because I heard the sound of bicycle bells. Judging from the few houses I had passed, this was a place where low-class prostitutes gathered, because those wooden signs and paper strips were pasted on the walls of each house. But before I had reached the end, a middle-aged woman heard footsteps, jumped out of another house, saw me, and put on a smiling face! She greeted me, and then swayed her buttocks, making a gesture to seduce people to fall into depravity. Her upper body was naked, and she was wearing a pair of red shorts. "Come on! I'll make you happy!" she said, walking down. I ran past in a panic, my back felt like it had been poured with a burst of ice water, and my whole body trembled. Finally, like a deserter running dozens of miles, I didn't dare to look back and walked out of that alley.</p>
<p>This happened a while ago. But what made me aware of the inside story of this "at your service" was on an early autumn afternoon. This impression will undoubtedly not be forgotten at the moment of my death. It showed me another side of the hell in this world. The thing is like this:</p>
<p>I often went outside Xizhimen to visit a good friend of mine at a certain school. Every time I got off the tram and stepped over the base of Xizhimen city wall, the rickshaw pullers would surround me and shout:</p>
<p>"Pull you there, go to Shanghai Dian!"</p>
<p>"Go to Chengdashuxiao for two diao qian, want it?"</p>
<p>When I didn't answer them, those rickshaw pullers would change their smiling faces and yell:</p>
<p>"Going to Huangtukeng? Take my car, I guarantee you!"</p>
<p>"What kind of place is Huangtukeng?" When I met my friend, I asked him this, because I really found the rickshaw puller's words mysterious.</p>
<p>Although my friend had lived outside the city for a long time, he couldn't even answer this "famous" place. And when I told this question to the doorman in the dormitory, those doormen were unexpectedly surprised.</p>
<p>"What? What do you two ask this place for?"</p>
<p>But he finally couldn't resist us, and on a Sunday afternoon, the three of us finally went to Huangtukeng.</p>
<p>It was a narrow and dirty street, with dust flying on the street, and the dust was filled with an unknown stench. From the intersection at the west end of the street, turn right, and facing you is a row of small mud houses coated with yellow soil. Outside, two or three naked male beggars were catching lice, all with a tuft of thick black chest hair. They looked at us with strange eyes, and then discussed in a kind of incomprehensible secret language.</p>
<p>"Hey, there are guests on the east side, go to the third house on the west side, Shunxi is pretty good, just came from Luomahu in Tianjin." One of them stood up and pointed to the west and said to us.</p>
<p>My friend was already scared and wanted to go back. The two of us walked to the front of that house. A piece of paper was pasted in front of the rotten bamboo curtain, which read: "Shunxi four diao at your service." There was also a row of small characters next to Shunxi, which was no longer clear.</p>
<p>A person ran out of the next house, carrying a top in one hand, panting and walking towards the east. It was at this time that a man lifted the curtain for us and let us go in.</p>
<p>Facing us was a row of earth pits, with some weeds on top of the pits. On top of the weeds was a woman lying with her upper body naked, while the outer pit was a completely naked blind woman, moaning softly there. The room was very dim, and a strong stench hit my nose.</p>
<p>"Shunxi, have a customer!" The man shouted loudly.</p>
<p>Hearing this voice, the woman on the left didn't raise her head or open her eyes, just lifted the broken blanket covering her lower body. Presented before our eyes was a woman with a body covered in red rashes, and her ankles and joints were already ulcerated, her whole body stripped bare.</p>
<p>I completely fainted, unable to say a word, unable to walk a step. Only when the old doorman took out twenty copper coins did the woman slowly open her eyes. Suddenly, she sat up, holding the straw, and looked at me with fiery eyes, looking at the doorman who was with me. She unconsciously tore off a bunch of hair (her hair was already very sparse), and waved her hands hysterically, shouting, "Hey, get out, get out, this is not a place for you to come!"</p>
<p>She seemed to want to get out of bed. I hurriedly lifted the bamboo curtain and ran out. Then I heard a burst of fierce crying, mixed with the man's crude and barbaric curses. Immediately, those beggars squatting outside hurried to that house.</p>
<p>Because of this, I couldn't eat for three whole days. When will these slaughtered people be saved?</p>
<h3>Mountain Goods Store</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>In the early summer morning, the sun had not yet broken through the earth, and a pile of dark clouds was pushed up from behind the east mountain; then a dense drizzle sprinkled down from the clouds.</p>
<p>Old Man A-Cai poked his head out from the gap in the awning of the small boat, looked at the calm lake surface, and then suddenly drilled back into the cabin.</p>
<p>"I got up in the middle of the night to go to the stern of the boat to relieve myself, and when I saw the east opening, I knew today must be unreliable..." He muttered to himself, while reaching into the "dry pond" to search for his damp tobacco pipe.</p>
<p>"It looks like the boat won't be leaving today again! When you go to the teahouse, go to Wanyuan Three Line to ask." His wife was lighting the stove, because the wet firewood couldn't catch fire, so the smoke was billowing out; she kept her mouth close to the stove door blowing air, while wiping away her tears with one hand. Thinking that it was raining today, and the boat couldn't leave as expected, she stopped blowing air and said to her husband.</p>
<p>Old Man A-Cai, however, lit a piece of paper tinder and started patting the tobacco pipe on the stern of the boat, making "ba ah! ba ah!" sounds. He seemed not to have understood what his wife said.</p>
<p>The people on Xia Street in the town gradually became lively, and the stalls on Shedu Bridge were also set up one by one; the teahouse under the Qiaodun was already full of villagers, leisurely drinking tea, and talking loudly about the market prices of mountain goods and rural news. A few small grocery stores and a mountain goods store also took off their row of doors and were sorting out the various goods, or putting out the goods shelves in front of the door.</p>
<p>The villagers came to the street in groups of three or five, some wearing a broken palm-fiber hat and a worn-out straw raincoat, while others carried an umbrella. They came to inquire about the small plum market and buy things.</p>
<p>"Opening store boss, what's the market price for small plums today!" Genfu walked to the front of the store and asked the big-headed Wanyuan Three like this.</p>
<p>"The market hasn't come yet. It's raining today, I'm afraid there won't be any customers." He shook his round head without expression.</p>
<p>The rain wasn't heavy nor did it seem like it was going to stop, it just drifted, drifted; the humid and low-pressure climate was oppressively uncomfortable.</p>
<p>At breakfast time, the general villagers returned to their homes to eat one after another; so the streets slowly became quiet, —the teahouse only had empty board tables left, and the scabby-headed waiter was lonely cleaning up the empty teapots and teacups.</p>
<p>At noon, the market became lively again; the front of Wanyuan Three's store was already full of loads of round green plums, and many men and women waiting to sell were panting and squeezing in front of the store, constantly wiping the sweat from their foreheads with the corners of their clothes. However, the big scale in the store, although still hanging on the eaves like a dried dead fish as usual, didn't look like it was about to open. Only a few weighers and clerks were lying on the counter talking and laughing.</p>
<p>"Hasn't the scale opened yet?" Anxious Huang Guanbao rested his load of plums and squeezed into the crowd to ask everyone.</p>
<p>"No! I've been waiting for almost two hours." A-Huizi turned his head and said.</p>
<p>Load after load of small plums were brought in, and they had almost piled up into a small hill; however, the store still showed no sign of action, and time passed moment by moment, getting close to evening soon.</p>
<p>"Is the scale going to open today?" A woman, a little impatient from waiting, asked the clerk lying on the counter and laughing.</p>
<p>"Not necessarily!" The clerk only answered faintly, and then turned his head away.</p>
<p>Anxiety and depression were tightly enveloping them. They felt that there was no hope of opening the scale today.</p>
<p>Wanyuan Three held a water pipe and lay on the window of the building, puffing and smoking, he looked at the people crowding in front of the store; Xian Taiqing Salt Company asked him to collect one hundred loads of small plums, and he could take advantage of this opportunity with few customers to suppress the price. Anyway, the villagers were waiting to use the money, and waiting until the scale opened tomorrow, the price could drop by at least half—at most only one yuan per load. As for Xian Taiqing Salt Company, it had already been agreed to pay three and a half yuan per load including commission to collect the plums. Moreover, he could deduct another 10% commission from the "orchard households", and the scale would also have differences? Wouldn't that two hundred yuan or so be readily available? This was ultimately less laborious than earning the commission alone! He couldn't help but smile when he thought of this. He looked at those anxious faces below and puffed on the water pipe with even more vigor.</p>
<p>It was still raining, and the reed mat shed in front of the store door was also leaking a little, dripping on the people crowding in the shed.</p>
<p>"If we don't sell it today, it will turn yellow tomorrow, what should we do?" Someone said worriedly.</p>
<p>"If no one wants it, dump it in the ditch!" Another person answered angrily.</p>
<p>In the evening, the rain had stopped, but the streets were very muddy, and the store had closed its row of doors early. Those orchard households had no choice but to disappointedly carry the original load of plums back, keep them overnight, and come back to sell them tomorrow. The several row of goods boats in the Shedu Bridge port were also crowded there without missing one.</p>

<h3>People of Suzhou (18)</h3>
<p>— Written by Gu Wenzong</p>
<p>Liya I really admire your eloquence. You can change my emotions at any time, which is not easy, is it?</p>
<p>Dajun (Hearing her say this, suddenly laughed) Hahahaha…</p>
<p>Liya (Softly) Miss Shen is so annoying! She laughed at me so impolitely, I'm really angry in my heart! - It's simply disadvantageous for such a person to sit in the chair opposite you, you should move to another seat. Jinghong He did not disrespect me in any way, and I am very comfortable sitting here, and the old line is also better, and finding a seat in the center of the car is even more chaotic than here. It has always been my habit to like a seat near the door...</p>
<p>Liya No, that person is... is that!</p>
<p>Jinghong What is it? Ah?</p>
<p>Liya (Whispering to her ear) He is the one who was really staring at me on the boat; that Suzhou person who looked at me!</p>
<p>Jinghong Oh! - I know!</p>
<p>Liya Now that you know, then move away.</p>
<p>Jinghong (Softly) I won't move, because I see myself as very dignified, I don't show a frivolous appearance, so no one will look down on me,</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Three Smiles Captivating Miss Qiu"</p>
<p>The best plan is to lure the tiger from the mountain. Tang Yin is ridiculed for always pretending. I was told to go to Wuzhong by Zhishan to tease you. I am. I dare not act for receiving such deep favor. Listen, sir. Terribly angry. I hate that you are too absurd in your life. You are just a scholar. How could there be. Twelve rows of golden hairpins in two lines. It's not that I'm exaggerating today. Among the blue-clad servants are beautiful women. It doesn't matter if you order the servant to choose. Busily summoned the housekeeper, the old woman. To gather all the plum fragrance of the mansion. Waiting for the screen of sparrows to become a pair. Good things are always troubled, as the ancients said. Peaches and plums are all unique. Only the king of flowers does not come out of the hall. Could it be that. At this time, I am not skillful in dressing up, and I will choose flowers at will. Evaluating the thin Yan and the fat Yang.</p>

<p>After selecting several people in succession, the day was already late. Listless and aimless. Hongshan saw the page's intention. Went to the room to discuss with the couple. The wife gave an antithetical couplet to test the page. Saying it's good to wait for the red lotus to welcome the summer rain. Who knew that he. Wants to climb the osmanthus and receive the autumn fragrance. This child has really strong eyesight. A pomegranate heart is anxious. A steady bottle is broken and splashing. Crying to death in the room and resurrected.</p>
<p>Xu Wenbi's Opening Chapter</p>
<p>Tongle (720) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening Chapter "Woman Cries for Agarwood"</p>
<p>The autumn scene is fragrant with osmanthus in August. A passionate woman cries in her boudoir. Only to hear. The sound of insects chirping outside the window is incessant. The wind blows the purple bamboo, rustling and响. The iron horse rings on the eaves. Lower my head in secret. Thinking to myself. Thinking of the handsome and talented man in my mother's house. It has not been half a month since I got married into my husband's house. The maid sends a letter into my room. Saying that the talented man is sick in his gums. I am just offering incense in vain. Praying to the heavens and the city gods. Wishing him peace and happiness. It has not been a month since I got married into my husband's house. The maid sends a letter into my room. Saying that the talented man has died. Making me. Cry to death several times and come back to life. My husband asked me why I was sad. I only said that my stomach pain is the hardest to bear. I should have come to the spirit to mourn. Only because I am just a newlywed bride. Not attending the funeral to the mourning hall. I can only secretly wear three parts of mourning for you. I tied a piece of linen to my chest. I don't wear red and green clothes. Wearing two plain home clothes. A pair of arch shoes on linen. I asked the maid to buy a piece of agarwood. I carved the handsome face of the talented man. Carved him with a square scarf and double ribbons. White jade in the center emits light. Wearing a sea blue sauce yellow belt. Red satin shoes with black satin trim. It's hard for me to carve you. Pacing back and forth in the study. It's hard for me to carve you. Opening your mouth and calling me dear little sister. It's hard for me to carve you. Playing chess opposite each other and watching the West Chamber. It's hard for me to carve you. Several times urging and difficult to distinguish. Only because the bridal sedan arrived at the hall. I had to harden my scalp to say goodbye to the talented man. When I turned upstairs, I cried sadly. Idle people only gossip. Only saying that I can't get rid of my parents. Who knows. I can't get rid of the affectionate and righteous talented man. Talented man. I say that your mouth is for offering on the dressing table. In the evening. The blue gauze curtain is used as a ancestral hall. There are so many sad things in the world. Other people's sadness is sad. My sadness is hidden in my stomach.</p>

<h3>A Grim Ancient Temple in "The Bloody Case of a Newlywed"</h3>
<p>As soon as it rains, the Yi Hua studio looks even more melancholic, especially these days, with a dilapidated and grim ancient temple standing there. However, the three large Buddha statues in the center show very amiable expressions. The fish oil lamps in front of the hall are flickering dimly. In the Cheat-proof Eternal Incense Burner, the smoke is always lingering, which is very evocative. However, when you look around again, terror will immediately grab your heartstrings. Not only do the huge Buddha statues around reveal fierce and terrible eyes and attitudes, but in the western corner, there are quietly lying five or six black and vermilion coffins. The eerie state is enough to make people feel chilly!</p>
<p>This is a large set in the new film "The Bloody Case of a Newlywed" (formerly "Father and Son Heroes") by Yi Hua Company, and it is fully enveloped in a terrifying and ghostly atmosphere.</p>
<h3>The Story of Begonia Red</h3>
<p>This story probably happened ten years ago!</p>
<p>"Begonia Red" is a woman who sings Ping opera. Because her husband is a good-for-nothing gambler, all the money she earns so hard is taken away by him to gamble. Later, even her own child was sold by her husband to others, and her old father died. "Begonia Red" herself was also taken by a warlord and imprisoned in the warlord's mansion. Later, after the revolutionary army arrived, she left the prison. It seems that the world has also changed, and everything is different. Everything in the past is over. After suffering so much, she was finally taken away by her own son. Thus, this woman who had wandered for many years finally found her home.</p>
<h3>Jack Holt and Ames Strong Co-Star in "Tide of Anger"</h3>
<p>Great Shanghai Screening</p>
<h3>United Photoplay Service Tidbits</h3>
<p>"The Lost Lamb," this work, after a very long production time and a large amount of capital, is Cai Chusheng's greatest success after "Song of the Fishermen," and it is also the most exquisite crop of United Photoplay Service this year.</p>
<p>"Go to Nature" is a film that fully represents [Yuan Muzhi's] style. "Wild Rose" and "The Road" are inferior to it.</p>
<p>After "Filial Piety," United Photoplay Service has another production of "Song of a Loving Mother." This ethical film develops the spirit of maternal love to the greatest extent.</p>
<p>In "Filial Piety," Zhang Yi plays a prodigal son who has awakened. In "Song of a Loving Mother," he plays a sacred worker, a kind son.</p>
<p>Li Lili worked very hard in "Go to Nature," and her acting skills are better than in any of her previous films.</p>
