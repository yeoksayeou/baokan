<h3 id="c22">阿軍繼續抗戰 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— 禹</p>
<p>在這國聯進行着撤銷對意制裁的期間我們聽到阿軍繼讀抗戰的消息覺得無限的感奮</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞過去的戰敗從各方面情形看來其主要原因全在於戰略的錯誤如果阿國不以密集的大隊和意軍正面作戰而採取分散流動式的游擊戰術必可支持到更久長的時間現在阿京和海拉爾兩大都市雖然在意軍手裏　是據英外相艾登最近在下院報告意軍所佔的阿國疆域還不足全國之半而且就實際上說大多數阿國民衆並不曾被意大利眞正征服只要殘餘的阿軍能够團結起來變更過去錯誤的戰略繼續對意軍抗戰前途該不至於完全絕望據日前路透社電訊阿國西境各部民衆刻正準備不槽任何代價抵禦意軍如果意軍向西推進阿人將用游擊戰法予以抗拒又一消息稱意軍至今不過佔據了阿國幾個主要城鎮在這些城鎭間有大部分土地小特未爲意軍攻克而且當地民衆還公然反抗意國的統治阿京至台西的大路雖經意軍佔領但意縱隊行經該路仍不能安然無恙至於阿國西部和南部意軍還不敢深入又一電訊稱阿境財政非常混亂路局法員甚至不肯收受意軍所付運兵運物費的意幣里拉</p>
<p>從這些情形我們至少可以認識下列幾點　阿國大部分地方仍然在混亂狀態中意大利耍維持其武力的統治當然非常困難　阿人仍有繼續抗戰的决心　阿軍已經改變戰略而採取游擊戰爭這種戰略隨時可使意軍受着巨創　意國財政上的混亂必將影響其侵略和統治的工作</p>
<p>總之我們至今還不能遽說阿比西尼亞已經無可挽救也不能給正在誇耀勝利的意大利樂觀到底在阿軍繼續抗戰的情勢之下阿此西尼亞的復國不是絕對不可能的事</p>

<p>（南京）日前滬報載有「行星將碰地球預言」、中央社記者特向中央天文台詢問該項預言、有無科學根據、據答如下、此項新聞前半尙與事實相近、後　故作驚人奇語、殊不足信、查比天文學家地路保太、確曾於本年二月十二日夜、在照片上攝得一小行星、後經推算、知共能越入地球軌道以內、與地球最近時、較任何行星或彗星更近、開近地星之新紀錄、現在觀測根據尙少、是以各家所算之軌道、不能盡相符合然大致兩心差甚大、軌道平面與黃道斜交度頗小、其尤要者、則穿過黃道之點距離地球軌道頗遠、所以照現在算得之各軌道情形、并無碰撞地球之可能、卽使軌道年久變遷、其碰撞機會亦至悠遠而難遇、至所傳哈佛大學天文台預言、明年九月碰撞云云、倘非傳言者故事張皇、亦必出於誤解、因哈佛大學近日雖無消息到此、但數月前之報告、亦祗有該星之軌道常識、正與比國天文學會所發表者大的相同也、更有謂碰撞之處將在某地某地、則更不足信、因此類小星、觀測材料至尠、所算周期日數尙不能凖、更何能决其碰撞之地點乎、近年以來、屢見有世界末日、月球破壤等謠言、大多利用羣衆好奇心理、以作投機誕妄之談、凡吾民衆、不必爲杞人之憂云、（二十三日中央社電）</p>

<p>瑞士蒙德婁城　洛桑會議頃於本日晨間、舉行第一次非公開會議、秘書長卽土耳其國外長魯舒第、當將該國所提出之新協定草案、（已見另電）略述一過、隨卽提付討論、會塲休息室中人士、頃宣稱、意國政府昨日曾　照會送達士國政府、聲明未能派員出席會議、迄至今晨、土國代表團尙未予以公佈、推厥原因、端由士外長希望意國政府、能將此項照會撤回、或加以修正、俾其詞句、羅為和緩、但羅馬方面今晨來消息、則謂意國個體戶府反對修正洛桑條約之議、並無何項變動云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>瑞士萊塞德婁城　洛桑會議、今晨舉行非公開會議時、秘書長卽土耳其國外長魯舒第、當卽宣讀國政府送達該國之照會、卽聲明未能派員出席者、幷表示希望意國代表團仍能及時參加、英國代表團卽該團公共工程部大臣史央請荷伯勛爵繼之發言、謂英國對於土國所提出之新協定草案、當在原則上接受之、日本代表卽該國駐法大使左籐亦作同樣表示、但須等待國政府詳細訓令、始可作進一步之辦法、蘇聯外委李維諾夫則謂該國願接受新協定草案、但該國艦隊必須能自一海開往另一海、此層甚望新協定草案勿加以忽視、此外法國·羅馬尼亞·希臘·南斯拉夫各國代表亦均表示接受、當由會議决定提付討論、幷指派兩種委員會、一卽起草委員會、一卽技術委員會、分別進行工作、幷定於本日午後、賡續開會、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今晨此間接蒙特婁消息、土耳其與蘇俄代表已在會議席上發生小爭執、蘇俄外委李維諾夫對於土耳其所擬之草約、顯非守全滿意、蘇約中規定蘇俄與黑海濱之諸國得以二萬五千噸之戰艦一艘出入韃靼納爾海峽也、聞蘇俄並願黑海成一封鎖區、不得容外艦駛過博斯波魯斯海峽、按蘇俄與法國訂有互助協定、故海峽對蘇俄艦隊之自由、至關重要、而蘇俄之觀察點必將有利於法國也、一般人士之印象、以為此次會議、其工作之擴大、必遠過於目前所擬定者、衆信各國將因海峽公的舉行地中海安全之總會議、今日開會時、衆推澳洲駐倫敦辦事專員卜魯斯為主席、衆甚注意此舉、消息靈通之觀察家謂卜氏之被推舉、足徵討論之際、英帝國防務問題必將置於前列、就歷史上之觀察點而論、此舉亦饒有興味、因當歐戰中首先攻擊韃靼納爾海峽者、為澳洲軍隊也、今晨各代表曾在議程各事辦竣後、曾舉行非公開會議、考慮土耳其提出之草約、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>蒙特婁　韃靼納爾海峽會議之各代表、均表示準備接受土耳其提出之草的為討諭基礎、惟泰半代表並曾表示對於的中議欵擬保留之各點、英外次史坦賀浦伯爵今日請衆注意的中未述及海峽重設軍防事、此為英政府所表示同情者、伯爵又謂關於海峽委員會一節、亦未提及、因此為國際水道、凡國際委員會不與土耳其卞權抵觸之原則、不應加以放棄云、（二十三日路透電）</p>

<p>瑞士蒙德婁城　蒙德婁會議本日下午四時十五分在此間開幕、先由瑞士聯邦政府政治部部長穆達、以東道主資格致開幕詞、略謂一九二三年洛桑條的、係輓近外交上最重要文件之一、土耳其政府今採正當之方式和平之程序、要求修改、此層至堪稱道、「此際主要問題、卽使士國主權得以恢復、同時又與一般利害關係曁國際商務利益、不相抵觸是也、余所望於蒙德婁會議者非他、卽各國相互信心因以增强、而歐洲目前不安狀態、為之减輕是也」云云、</p>
<p>次由土耳其外長魯舒第將該國所提要求略叙遍、並加以辯謹、謂韃靼尼爾與博斯破魯斯兩海峽之現行制度、係由一九二三年之洛桑條的所規定、而由英法意日四國為之聯合担保、（因當時土耳其政府對於國聯會盟的所可提供之集體保障、不能認為滿足、）迨至今日時過境遷、四國聯合担保難於發生實效、已屬無可諱言、夫捍衛國土、係任何國家之基本權利、此乃千古不易之定理、　海峽不設防務、旣與斯旨互相抵觸、自不應再予維持、</p>
<p>次由羅馬尼亞外長蒂杜樓斯哥發言、略謂余敢提供保證、各國對於土耳其所提要求、定當經由談判途徑認眞加以研究、又謂兩海峽固為土耳其之腹心、卽與羅馬尼亞亦有切膚關係、述及巴爾幹協商公約謂羅七兩國同係簽字國、休戚攸關、利害相共、最後則謂土耳其政府此次採取合法程序、遵守條約約束、至堪欽佩</p>
<p>至是英國公共工程大臣史丹荷伯勛爵乃起立發言、提及德國問題、對於該國最近片面廢止洛迦諾公的之舉、加以抨擊、謂歐州一般時局未能改善、職是故也、又謂蒙德婁會議、乃係軍縮會議議而無功暨國聯會遭遇、困難之結男、一言以蔽之、國際會議旣均失敗、各國對於本身安全、乃不得不惟自力是恃、以故土耳其所提要求、乃屬事理之常，英國政府當竭誠加以研究、最後則謂「吾人始終以為遵守國際條的義務、乃係外交關係之礎石、無如片面廢止條的行為、吾人最近業已目覩其事矣」云云、</p>
<p>法國前不管部閣員彭古繼史丹荷伯發言、對於土耳其政府所採合法步驟、備致讚揚、謂「土耳其政府寗循和平之程序、而不願出於違反條的之行徑、此層殊足稱道、法國對於士國所提要求、亦當鄭重加以研究、</p>
<p>至是蘇俄外交委　長李維諾夫乃繼起發言曰「韃靼尼爾海峽在蘇俄視之、實乃國家生命所關之神經中樞、」嗣謂、「溯當一九二三年洛桑會議舉行之際、歐洲方遭大戰浩刦之後、各國所行政策無不在開始調整之中、一般人士猶抱和平幻想任何政府不敢冒大不韙、而崇尙戰爭也迨至今日、形勢大變國家主義風靡待、爾虞我詐各不相下、若干國家公然凖備戰事、並宣傳戰爭罔無顧忌、環顧域中、孰愛和平、敦嗜戰爭、涇渭分明、為之區別畛域自非難事、土耳其民族意好和平、昭信於世人、事實具在、無可置欵以故蘇聯對於土國所提要求、務當秉深切諒解之心理、滿懷妥協之精神、加以研究」云、</p>
<p>日本駐法大使佐藤繼李維諾夫發言、謂土國斯舉動機所在、日本政府完全了解、「夫洛桑條的關於海峽問題若干條欵、有重加考慮之必要、日本為該條的簽的國而兼担保國、自所明悉、以故對此問題準備參加合作、其對於土耳其所提新公的草案（見另電）大綱亦表同情、但因日本現已退出國聯會、故在實行新公約若干條約之時、日本不能參加合作云、</p>
<p>其後由希臘代表波利蒂斯、南斯拉夫代表蘇波維區·保加利亞代表尼哥拉夫·相繼發言、對於土耳其所採取之外交政策均加稱道、並聲明各該國均願將修改洛桑條約問題加以考慮云、</p>
<p>最後選舉英國代表卽澳洲聯邦駐英特派員勃魯斯為主席、希臘代表卽該國駐法公使波利蒂斯為副主席、國聯會軍縮事務股股長亞格尼特為副秘書長、並定於明日舉行非公開會議、討論士耳其所提草案、遂卽宣吿散會、（十二日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>據報載·上海中華工業國外貿易恊會，最近為積極謀國產外俏，開拓國外市塲，發展海外貿易起見，特有南洋商業考察團的組織，並决定在下月三日起，將分批首途赴南洋各地－馬尼拉·泗水·吧城·新加坡·檳榔嶼·西貢·暹羅·棉蘭等處，前往考察，且携帶大批國貨樣品·樣本，擬分赴各處宣傳，與當地商業界作密切的聯絡，實為國產推銷海外的前途的一個先聲。</p>
<p>在這整個的國產界，正困於風雨飄　的現狀之下，我們聽到這一個可喜的消息，的確是夠快樂的，我們知道，在過去及現在，國外是正有着不少的僑胞，尤其是在南洋各他，他們都很熱烈地切望祖國，需求國貨，所以：我們這次前往，一面是定必受他們盛大的歡迎，可是·在另一方面，我們必需就要做到使他們完全滿意的地步，我希望考察團諸公，要努力盡那開拓的先導的任務和使命，到那邊多做實際的工作，尤其應値得注意下列的三點：現在·我把字寫下來，作我一些微小的貢獻：</p>
<p>第一·擴大宣傳·南洋各地，本來是被外貨侵占的區域，那裹有許多僑胞，正所謂欲用國貨而不可得，所以·我們這次前去，一定要擴大國貨宣傳，注重廣吿及貨品樣本的編製，使他們首先有對國產深切的印象，同時·明瞭國人應用國貨的原理，使大家愛用國貨。</p>
<p>第二·設立永久陳列館·在這次我們前往後，應趁各界僑胞對國貨有熱烈好感時，更進一步，謀在那邊設立永久的國貨陳列館，使那裹的居民，販賣商，可更有充分的認識，並可繼續向滬上國貨廠商，　續訂購。</p>
<p>第三·解决種種困難問題·過去國產不能往銷南洋的原因，是因了有許多技術上的困難問題阻撓着，這次我們前去，如對於包裝問題，航運與銀行押匯問題，匯兌上幣制預算問題，必需與當地商業界，共同獲得相當的解决辦法，以利於未來貿易的發展和進行。</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>欲求中國國貨工業之發展，莫如健全同業組織，而工商同業公會法之修正，尤為當務之急。最近立法院實業部旣有修正工商同業公會之擬議，上海市商會第七屆會員代表大會重要之議决案，為健全商人團體組織，同業必須加入公會，公會必須加入商會，已經大會一致通過。値此修改法令尚未頒布之時，吾人宜有七種之準備：</p>
<p>一未有公會者，從速組織公會，以統一本業之意旨，整齊本業之步驟。</p>
<p>二組織公會後，有同業未加入者，應分別調查，勸其加入，俾收集思廣益遇事恊作之效。否則法令所限，遲早不能逍遙會外，以破壞同業之陣綫也。</p>
<p>三於工商業同業公會之外，應組織輸出業同業公會，以為發展國外貿易之先聲。</p>
<p>四於商會法以外，應請政府頒布工業會法，以工業同業公會為基礎，俾工業界有健全之組織</p>
<p>五同業應就鑑定檢查統計產銷量等　工作用統制方法着手準備嚴密之組織。</p>
<p>六同業在走私猖獗聲中應堅壁淸野負責　檢查出品，遇有私貨，應卽刻檢　為同業作保障。</p>
<p>右之所陳吾國貨界應積極準備，並願吾政府當局早日促成，以挽救國貨工業於垂絕之境。</p>
<h3 id="c157">國貨橡皮圈的需要 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— 玉峯</p>
<p>我現在所說的「橡皮圈」。是像南京路上的各大百貨公司　商店藥房等所用　為包紥東西的橡皮綫圈。因為這種橡皮圈能寬緊自如。簡捷省事。用以代替蔴綫紗帶。有過之無不及。且價値綦廉。和蔴綫紗帶。不相上下。所以與其用蔴綫和印紗帶。有如用橡皮圈來得省事。因此一般新式些的大公司。大商店。都採用橡皮圈來包紥東西的。</p>
<p>說起橡皮圈。我就有點感觸了！據我一位專營文具業的朋友說：「這種橡皮圈。以劣貨居多數。在文具用品中。銷路很大。每年的漏巵，倒也不少……」這樣看來，只是一般小工業界和橡膠廠商　不去注意罷了。</p>
<p>日本原是個工業最發達的國家。尤其是對於日常用品。創製仿造。可謂無微不至。在我們工業落後的中國國民。向來愛用洋貨，見了價廉物美的貨品，怎麼不樂用呢？現在把簡捷省事的橡皮圈。供給我們。在此「走私」嚴重聲中。這類東西。更是廉之又廉。使我們擯彙國產的蔴綫和紗帶不用。而做他們的忠實推銷員。在此「市民國貨年」中。我國貨橡膠廠商。不乏有先見之明。趕快起來仿造。杜塞這。涓涓細流的漏巵。不要以為它是「微小」。不足介意。要知在此今日山窮水盡的中國社會經濟裏面。實實在在要有不能再買　貨的「决心」！否則近幾年來力竭聲嘶所專喊的「婦女國貨年」。……其效力還不是等於零麽？長此下去。社會經濟恐慌。不知要弄到如何田地、那末我寫這篇的動機。要厚望於我國產橡膠商的努力了！</p>

<p>餘杭章太炎先生，於本月十四日上午八時，病歿於蘇州錦帆路五十號，噩耗傳來，識與不識，莫不表示哀悼，淸季鼓吹革命，被　西獄，不易其志，民元袁氏拉攏，聘充顧問，不為所用，厥後將其幽禁，詩酒白遣，怡然自得，可穩富貴不淫，貧賤不移，威武不屈，晚年講學吳門，著作甚富，當此道德淪亡，人慾橫流之際，正賴此樸學大師發揮所學？以挽人心，詎料天不　遺，哲人其委，在國家失一耆舊，在士林失一導師，能不悲痛！　世人祗知先生是革命前輩，文學泰斗，不知先生還是一個提倡國貨之實行家，余追隨其杖履較久，用將關於提倡國貨方面之懿行，錄實本刋，俾資模仿。予得識先生，在民五以後，其時黎黃陂當國，贈以「東南樸學」四字橫額而南歸，寓於法租界某里，渠之快婿態　生，係嘉興人，曾肄業秀水學堂，與予同鄕同學之誼，由其介紹而晋謁，初以為革命鉅了，久居外洋，必穿西裝，不料理想與事實相反，先生則穿綿綢短衫褲外，而罩紡綢長衫，不特無留學生之習氣，並且與鄕下土老兒相仿，時予在南翔義務學校擔任敎務，自是以後，每遇星期，必至滬上聆敎，獲益良多。見其所穿之衣，無一洋貨，詢以故，據云浙省向出絲綢，餘杭之綿綢更有名，予（先生自稱）係浙人，且籍隸餘杭，鳥得不用本鄕所出之物，而反購舶來品，致利權外溢。並詳述綿結軟滑而能收汗，以之做短衫褲，冬夏皆宜，且能耐用，可稱價廉物美，臨行並蒙惠賜一疋，而痛斥一般沾染歐化者，從　外人學識之皮毛，對於衣食住行，處處模仿外洋之喪心病狂，謂有講笑話一鄕下縉紳之子，在外國留學多年，回國時西裝革履，意氣自豪，儼然一簇新人物，對於國內一切事物，批得半個銅錢不値，一日乃父詢以外國與中國比較，究竟好在何處，渠先謂外國政治淸明民衆團結，故國富民强比中國好，繼謂外國房屋高爽，街道平坦，故起居適宜比中國好，乃父正在頷首表示贊　時，其子忽指天上之月而謂，不知如何外國之月，亦較中國之月皎潔可愛。至是乃父始知其一味盲從，故遂信口胡言，以上所說雖係笑話，但事實上厭　國貨酷嗜外貨者確有視中國各物如糞土，視外國貨物若珍寳之心理，我輩讀書明理之人，應拿定宗旨，不為外物所有，乃能挽旣倒之狂瀾，語重心長，殊堪欽佩，所以太炎之家內一切器具衣服，絕少舶來品，所吸捲菸向南洋烟草公司購白金龍者，親友知其是提倡國貨之實行家，故所送物品，亦限國貨，此事恐外間知者尚鮮，故特表而出之，以吿閱者。</p>

<p>— （徐樹人）</p>
<p>「爭」，是爭奪侵略的意思，「掙」，是掙扎解脫的意思；前者為强者的行為，後者為弱者反抗的表示。但是，「爭」乃强者臨死不捨的習慣，「掙」未必個個多能用到——因為有許多的弱者見强者來呑併的時候，自己早縮手就範了啊！</p>
<p>假使强者棄去了「爭」，世界馬上就會和平：弱者棄去了「掙」，不獨沒有和平發現，正所以促進戰爭的滋長！事實吿訴我們：『「爭」是不會消滅的』那末弱者之羣，卽應整齊步伐，聯合陣綫，來拚命的「掙」！一息尙存，此志不容稍懈；縱因掙扎而滅亡，都是光榮的，何况繼着掙扎的弱者正多着呢！</p>
<p>殘暴的强者啊！你切勿以「爭」為你延續生命的寳筏，須知弱者是會猛省的，他們猛省「掙扎」是他們保存生命唯一的工具！他們要在「掙扎」下實現他們的希望。注意啊！那種「爭」結果是敵不住這個「掙」的！</p>

<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>跟着朋友，從電影院出來，踱進了隣近的一家咖啡座。一位年紀只得十八九歲，臉蛋兒圓圓地，雖然並不美麗，但也並不瞧着惹厭的女招待，嫺熟地招呼着我們坐下。從塗着厚厚一重粉，和胭脂的嘴角邊，泛出了一個淺淺的酒窩來輕輕地把一本繫有一枝鉛筆的小型拍紙簿，安放在我的朋女的面前，從殷紅的嘴唇上流出了一句話來，「你有一星期，不上我們這裏來了。」</p>
<p>「對」，我那朋友點點頭，接着道，「來二客咖啡牛奶，你若閒着，也去討一客來。」女招待點點頭，把腰兒一扭，踅向裏間去，不多一會，自己捧着三盃熱騰騰的牛奶，放在小圓桌兒上，自己便挨着我那朋友坐下。一壁攪弄着牛奶，一壁低低地問我那朋友道，「短命的小陸，現在可還在上海麽？」我那朋友搖搖頭道，「算了，你還要和他那麽認眞麽？」那女招待把眼向下一沉，堅定地說道，」我有朝一日，找見了他，總得和他算一下子這一年來的淸賬」。</p>
<p>「得了，一切都算在我的賬上罷。」朋友俏皮地笑着說，把沉悶的空氣打破了，我也忍不住的笑，逗得那女招待也笑了。一壁笑，一壁對我的朋友，不住的瞪白眼，朋友只裝沒瞧見，又鄭重地複述一遍道，「一切都算在我的賬上，得了」。</p>
<p>在柔和的暗綠色的燈光下，坐了近四十分鐘聽那女招待述說完了和小陸的一段羅曼斯在伊含着二包眼淚，咬牙切齒的一個塲面中，我那朋友，捺却了二塊錢，戴了帽兒，拉着我跨出了那咖啡座。在黃昏的街道上，深深地吸了一口氣，擲掉了一個橡皮頭的烟蒂兒，道，「老弟，你可有意於給小陸，了此一段孽緣麽？」</p>
<p>「謹遵台命，但不知是否算在尊賬上面？」我說着，大家相對着笑了。</p>
<p>在一聲晚安聲中，我踏着踉蹌的步子回家。但是從那一天起，不知怎的，我似乎多了一重心事。</p>

<p>標準丈夫，是我的一位新同居，是我們那個石庫門裏，若干女太太們，所公送的尊號。</p>
<p>說起了這位標準丈夫，眞是十足的够得上標準二字。他是在一家洋行中供職的，年約三十五歲左右，沒有孩子，也沒有女傭，整個家庭中，就不過是他們夫婦二人。他的夫人，是一位足有一百六十磅的大胖子。夫婦倆的愛情極　。</p>
<p>這位標準丈夫，每天總是天亮就起身。起身之後，第一件事，是揩窗，掃地，洗茶盃。這些完畢之後，提籃而去買小菜。大致在八點鐘不到些，提了一籃小菜回家。同時，也總是買些早點回來的。他把早點，吃掉一半，留一半給他夫人。吃過早點之後，忙着殺魚，或是切肉，接着，是洗菜，淘米，若是天晴，還得忙裏偸閒的晒幾竹竿衣服。到八點三刻，才戴上帽子，出去辦公。</p>
<p>他的夫人，不拘寒暖，總是十點鐘才起牀。盥洗之後，略進晨餐，便下樓煮飯。待到十二點一刻，飯煮好了，丈夫回來了，於是伊又回房去休息，由伊丈夫來做菜。搬送上樓，盛飯洗盌等事，都是標準丈夫的工作。午飯之後，標準丈夫，略事料理，又出去辦公。他的夫人，便下樓去打牌。（沒有牌局，便閉起房門打中覺。）晚飯的伺候，不用說了，自然又是標準丈夫負責的。</p>
<p>星期六下午，是標準丈夫洗地板的日子。前後二小時，準把那地板，擦洗得纖塵不染。</p>
<p>這位標準丈夫，毅然地把一切家務重任，獨自仔肩着，眞可說得是一時無兩。除了倒便桶與洗衣服二事，包給別家老媽子承乏外，甚麽都是自己幹的。他的夫人，每日只是睡覺，打牌，十分自在。因此同居的若干女太太，對此標準丈夫，都有恨不相逢未嫁時之感，而艷羨着那位標準丈夫的夫人，有這麽偉大的福氣。</p>
<p>但是人心總是不知足的，在女太太們的閒話中，伊總是流露着伊的丈夫，也有美中不足的所在，雖然肯做事，只是掙不起大錢。</p>

<p>— （闌刪）</p>
<p>前兒早上七句鐘樓樣，一輛兼捉乞丐的巡捕車，停在老靶子路北江西路更富　口，有幾個中西探捕，下車入衡，分向幾家專供外國丘八御用的私娼寨子里去拿人。道些私娼們，正是好夢方酣時候，給從床上抓起，頭髮蓬鬆，玉容寂寞，衣裳不整，睡眼惺忪，看見如狼似虎的公人，早嚇得魂飛天外。有些膽子小的，哭得珠淚闌珊。有些膽汁够的，覷個空兒急走。但到底釜中捉鱉，手到拿來。不上半個鐘頭，已經可以「車載斗量」了。當時筆者觸景生情，有詩嘆曰：「淸晨七點，巡捕車來；更富里內，羣鷄亂飛」。</p>
<p>據說伊們被捉之後，由捕房而轉解入法院，如審明本人不願操此皮肉生涯者，可送往慈善機關過活。如屬本人自願為娼的，按情罰鍰釋放。可是奇怪得很，伊們之中，竟沒有一個人被逼為娼，百分之九九供說自願的。因為伊們知道慈善機關不比寨裏有好的穿着玩吃也。</p>
<p>伊們旣放，不久又要被捉被罰的。——據說要罰到伊害怕以至於改業為止。——好一個處置！善哉善哉！</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第三回　雨細風斜還來留跡處　夜闌人靜獨寫絕交書</p>
<p>章老太道：這是今天的話。這幾天我看你坐在書房裏，只是坐着發悶想，不知道是怎麽了。國器笑道：你老人家是痛愛兒子過分了，處處多心，其實沒有什麽。章老太道：只要你沒有什麽就好，我還能願意你有心事嗎？飯後，國器不敢再出門去，就在書房裏看書了。不過看到三五頁之後，便又作起幻想來，母親今天的問話，却也事出有因，這幾日的成績太好了，他昨天最後一次相會，當我手扶帽　的時候，他望着我，也有點首答禮的意味。這樣下去，就可以同他通言了。本來相熟到這種程度，還沒有知道人家姓什麽，這究竟是不對。每天見他的時候，必定要開口了。這開口第一句話。怎麽樣子說呢？我就按照着西洋的風俗開口，姑娘，我可以問你貴姓嗎？但是假如他不答應我呢？或者簡直不會的。因為彼此認識了一個月上下，他巳經知道我是章唳天了。有好幾次看到他手上拿了雜誌，那雜誌都是有我的文字的。在這一點上，證明波此是文字之交了。文字之交通一通名姓，有何不可？他肯拿了我的文字去看，我問他的話，决不會拒絕的。冒一回險罷，害怕什麽？無論如何，他不能够不理我的。想到這地方，似乎是一個算學難題巳經解决了，就伸手將桌子一拍。但是在拍過一響之後，立刻想到這種聲響，是不宜讓母親聽到的。立刻鎭定了精神，向面前擺的一本書看看。所幸這一響，母親並未聽到，安然過去。到了次日起來，天上巳是飛着細雨烟子。巷子裏面，泥水淋漓的，似乎巳經下過一晚的雨了。這種天氣，恐怕小姐們是不肯濕淋淋的冒了雨上學的。縱然上學，他們也要坐車子，豈能步行？今天繞了道去遇他，那是多此一舉的。本來也可以不去。但是為了保持自已的這一番忠實起見，就是不遇到他，也要繞上這樣一個圈子，以便萬一他還來上學，也不至於差錯了。國器有了這種感想，他打傘冒雨出門，是慢慢兒的，在那幾條窄巷子裏走看。可是當他在那幾條窄巷子穿走遍了以後，天上的雨絲，正是牽着綫網一樣斜斜的向下落着。心裏忽然笑起來，這眞是自已太忠實了，假如我是一個女學生，在這樣大雨之下，我也是不出來的。心裹想着，一陣風來，傘撑不住撲了一臉的雨。這就快走起來，就要到學堂裹去上課。不想在這念路轉口，一家大門樓子下面，先有一把小小的雨傘，由那裏伸到檐溜下面來。（三九）</p>

<h3 id="c189">日本觀光引導者的黑幕 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>走完日本三島，也不過幾個神社，幾處溫泉而已。但是宣傳有方，大吹法螺之後，自然有西洋人不遠千里而來觀光的，以嘗試東洋趣味。春秋兩季，由觀光得來的利益，倒十分景氣，因此日本觀光局的特殊機關，便永久的繁盛着。西洋人到日本觀光，均須雇用引導者，日本人名之曰「案內」。此種特殊職業，都是由旅館侍者和車夫出身，全國約有二百餘人。中間黑幕重重，不是領了外人去玩女子，便是買古董從中騙錢。中國人到日本來觀光的，大都有留學生領導的，用不着「案內」。况且幾個漢文又騙不過中國人，因此他們便不喜歡引導中國人了。</p>
<p>在橫濱有一個「案內人」的公會，每一人要出股本二三千元，而並不缺員，可見這個職業是很肥的。他們按着號碼，乘次接伴旅客。但是也可任旅客，隨意指定的。他們每天的收入大約可有七元至十元，但是每年觀光船來去，也不過是四個月。其餘的時間，便要做旁的生意，或是坐吃。因此他們多數兼營古董，而妻子則在橫濱開設獨特的秘密旅館。</p>
<p>引導者終日伴着外人，吃着西菜，坐着汽車，生活十分安適。就是在旅館裏雖然住了三塊錢的房間，反而可以收入一塊錢的。所以凡是招待觀光客的旅館，無一不和他們連通一氣的，否則就是帝國飯店，也要關門。不要說是旅館。其餘購買什物，以及奏着三弦的藝妓，他們也有康密興。况且外人到日本來觀光，都是富翁，幾千塊錢，是不算一回事的。有一次一個美國婦人，在日光鄕村裏出三十塊錢買了個土瓶，引導者得了三分之一。還有一次美國的富豪在橫濱古董店裏，看見了一個古佛，交易沒有成功。引導者說得天花亂墜，决定是鎌倉時代的東西，全日本只有三個，除了橫濱是京都和日光兩處。後來領到日光古董店裏，果然也發現了同樣的一尊，金彩比橫濱的更佳，便出了六千元購去。其實橫濱的古佛，應了引導者之請，早巳乘了火車，在日光恭候了。日本的古董，時常在神戶長崎兜圈子，都是要候觀光客而來的。</p>
<p>三十年前京都祗園的雪娘，做了一次馬爾加夫人之後，便得數萬元。東京的娼妓，遊女，藝妓，得着外人靑睞，而發財的更非少數。鄕間少女，時常由引導者介紹而做着觀光者的臨時配偶，只要有金錢，當然可論價賣買。外國人之所以熱戀日本，或即因此。其他由引導者而成外國婦人入幕之賓的也有。如松本者，和伊大利的中年婦人，在日本遊歷了三個月，儼然夫婦。分別之後，便把私蓄在橫濱開起家具店了。還有新金山的老婦，在日本觀光中病故了，把正金銀行的存欵，完全贈給引導者，囑他把屍骨搬運回鄕，那更是意外的收穫子。</p>
<p>女性的引導者也有十數人，她們都在法國或是美國，住過好多年，說着一口的流利的外國語。和外人交際，同棲生活，也有相當的經騐了。穿着華麗的衣服，比舞女更摩登呢。在箱根日光熱海的旅館裏，和觀光客出入相隨着，那裏還認得出是日本人呢。最近觀光局很想利用女性的引導者，那是別個問題了。（譯自「話」雜誌四月號第三二三頁）</p>

<p>我從小是受過了這樣的敎育的。——小的時候。偶爾地和幾個牧牛童或是那些佃戶底兒女們，混在一起玩耍。祖母瞧見了，就硬把我拖進家裏去，嚴厲的帶着恐嚇的口吻對我說，「千吩咐，萬吩咐，敎你不要混在他們堆裏去，你偏不聽話。長大了敎你去做那「一脚牛屎一脚泥」的耕田漢去」。</p>
<p>接着，在空閒下來，或在睡覺之前，我吵着要講故事。祖母也常常給我描繪一些像永全伯伯，鼎祥二爺（我鄉里裏的大財主）底芳菲的生活。</p>
<p>在幼稚的心上，至今還留下些輕微的印象：</p>
<p>……啣着旱烟竿，打扮得挺整齊的，安閒而悠適地，在田基上踱來踱去。佃戶們一眼瞧見，就忙着搶上前去請安，問好。而他們呢，家裏都有很大很大的米倉，好幾房的太太，又都是鄉裏面許多人家底債權人。……</p>
<p>而我自家也不知所以地漸漸地對這種人底生活羨慕起來。對於那些在生活底渦流裏邊打滾的人們，尤其是那些拉縴的船夫，犂田挿秧的莊稼人，推小車的車夫，就存着輕蔑的卑視之感。至於為什麽會這樣做的，我是沒有充分的理由可以明說的。</p>
<p>過後，我又學會了一些滿漂亮的新名詞，對於那班以變相的形式，而拿自己底勞力為食糧的人們，就呌他們做。「生活的奴隸」！</p>
<p>我有個在香港大學得到學士位的表哥，有一次，在上海遇着他，聽得他常常以「下流的卑劣東西」為罵人的口頭談。我也曾模仿過他，遇到那些所謂生活底奴隸們觸怒了我就罵道：「下流的卑劣東西」。</p>
<p>祖母和叔伯們都稱讚我「有骨氣」，「有長進」。</p>
<p>時光把我底年齡增加起來了。</p>
<p>眞怪，不知在什麽時候染上了一種難以治療的病症。寂寞地一個兒在想着什麽，或讀着什麽，心就煩惱起來。好像陰霾的天上，四周圍的黑雲都集結在一個地方似的。同時，又好像自己底心已經變成了一塊頑固的石頭一樣，用刀破也破不開，用斧砍也砍不碎。</p>
<p>每當年關或節日，看見父親頓着足回家，對着蒼黯的天空長吁短嘆，甚至氣青了臉孔倒在坐椅上，……並且，</p>
<p>年復一年，我總得到太多的不如意事件。眼看着希望像水泡兒般一個個的隱沒了。我又挹鬰，又懊惱，又憂怨，命運之於我，正是魔鬼一樣的刁惡，狡猾，很毒啊。我憤怒了！——雖然，那些不如意的事情，是由於我底太多的夢想而造成的。！白天，我詛咒着它；（惡運，使我底家門日漸消沉的惡運）。黑夜我也詛咒着。可是，愈這樣，那魔鬼却儘像幽靈一般的跟蹝住我。一時不覺察又約它侵襲上身了。曾經一次又一次的，試作努力去擺脫那魔鬼，不過事情並不是這麽簡單。惡運始終阻礙着美夢底來臨，而毫不顧憐地把我整個的侵佔住，不論是在春天，夏天，秋天，…………</p>
<p>這麽着，我是不能不對於什麽都懷着一種煩惱和恐怖的感覺了。——一種含有普遍性的，對於每一樣細微的東西都煩惱，恐怖的感覺啊。</p>
<p>我感到我底心情已經蛻變了。</p>
<p>對於先前羨慕的東西，現在都厭倦了，好像在那上面嗅着一種腐壞的氣息似的憎惡着。對於先前所卑視的所謂生活底奴隸們，却反增加了一種同情之感</p>
<p>每每對着鏡子的時候，輕撫着那憔悴的面頰，就不能自主地太息了。——</p>
<p>「明天，啊，明天，將是怎樣的一個日子呢」！</p>
<h3 id="c191">郭掌櫃 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 鄒衡</p>
<p>郭掌櫃的舖子已好久沒有生意了。每天雖還不斷地有買主進來，可是多半只問了價錢便頭不回地冷笑着走出去。一天，兩天，一月，兩月，老是這樣，郭掌櫃的受不住了。他咬着牙對夥計說</p>
<p>『拚了吧，再跌價！』</p>
<p>『不過，郭掌櫃的，咱們的貨已一分利都不看了，粗莊貨已打着九五折，這樣做，簡直是…』夥計兼賬房先生的王大利對他說，後來看到郭掌櫃的靑白的臉色，便沒有勇氣再說下去。實在這些郭掌櫃的心里都很明白，他知道他舖子的貨價碼不能再跌了，便照這樣賣出去，也在虧着本。不過如其放在架子上不動，倒不如賠幾個錢推出去。</p>
<p>『再跌，照原價再打八折！』他對夥計說，臉更白，牙也咬得更緊。這回，王大利沒再說話，只把兩隻眼死釘着郭掌櫃的沒有血色的臉。他明知掌櫃的這樣做簡直自己毀自已。可是不這樣成嗎？別家舖子大批都是漏稅貨，成本比他的要便宜一半，若不再跌價，那只有永世擺在架子上看。他知道掌櫃的苦處，他也知道就這樣也競爭不過別家。可是！可是，他不再想了，遠處是一片無盡的黑暗。</p>
<p>『撞着看吧』！他的最後的結綸。</p>
<p>當天夜裏他們忙了一夜，把貨價重標了一次，第二天早晨，天一亮，王大利便把寫好的色紙廉價廣吿牌張出去，「不顧血本，廉價傾銷」！郭掌櫃的往返在櫃臺外步着，有時望望門外，街上一輛運貨車正載着各色各樣的貨物，從他們前過去，兩個XX人，在車後隨着，直運到他斜對過的天泰號的大門裏去。</p>
<p>「私貨」！像兩顆炸彈在他眼前爆發了。他不自覺地往後蹌踉地退了一步，倚在門裏的櫃臺上。</p>
<p>『怎麽』？王大利丟下手裏正整理着的貨，跑過去扶他。他搖了搖手，表示自已並不要緊，一邊掙扎着坐起。心裏却淸楚地意識到自己的舖子是「完了」！</p>
<p>『十年的心血啊』！他輕輕地吐出這幾個字來。</p>
<p>『郭掌櫃的』，王大利走到他身旁，低聲呌。『事情已竟這個樣了，難過也沒用。誰能料到鬼子漏稅貨會來得這樣猛，不過市面上受影響的也不止咱一家：洪升，元利，永豐泰，那家不是這樣？當然他們東家硬，市面上還呌得開，咱們這種小舖子可就受不了。不過，』他把聲音放得更低，指着門外斜對過舖子說：『咱們幹麽不也這樣幹，天津有幾家洋行，只要交一半現欵，再找個舖保就可取貨，櫃上現在還有二百塊錢的現欵，這月房租先不付，永和錢莊的欵子，橫堅已拖了兩個月了，好好說着打上這月利息，本錢押一月再還，把這現欵到天律辦一批貨來，只要…』他的話還沒說完，便被郭掌櫃打岔了。</p>
<p>『我也這樣想過，房東倒容易對付，只是永和錢莊怕不容易纏，不過也只好這樣了，拚着瞧吧』！事情便這樣决定了，王大利帶了所有的現欵趁車到天津去了，郭掌櫃一個人留在舖子里，他把廣吿又改寫了個「半價傾銷！」</p>
<p>買主果然多了，郭掌櫃一個人忙着。他被着架上的貨一天一减少下去，心里說不出的輕鬆，而然這輕鬆却也攪着苦汁。</p>
<p>一天，兩天，三天，王大利還沒回來，郭掌櫃心里急起來，他懷疑他捲着欵子偸跑了，一想，王大利不會是號樣人，他們是七年櫃夥了。</p>
<p>下午，他得到消息，是因為王大利定貨太少，外國人不肯包送，他一個人帶着從大路偸運被緝私的帶去了。</p>
<p>晚上，郭掌櫃的舖子門關的特別早，第二天便沒有再開。直到第三天才被人發現他直挺的懸在樑上。</p>
<h3 id="c192">黃皮（續昨） <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 仇同</p>
<p>「恐怕我們這裏要開汽車路了！園子和屋頭都打滿了椿！」</p>
<p>黑骨二的心宛如陷落似的朝下一沉，嘴巴抖簌簌的不知怎樣問才是：「車路——嗯嗯，那個講？」</p>
<p>兒子對他爺覷視了一眼，接着說道：「都說那椿子是有禍無福的，衙門裏黃得標也這樣吿我說要開了，從前　尾開汽車路也是先打這樣的椿子，打到樁子的田地就要覇佔去造車路，連墳頭都要給你掘來——」</p>
<p>黑骨二呻吟了一聲，咳嗆起來，咳得滿面通紅，他撫着胸脯朝兒子氣喘喘地問：</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>「硬覇嗎？」</p>
<p>「不硬覇，還誰和你講交情！」兒子道：「如果眞的是……哼，的靠不大住！」把頭儘搖。</p>
<p>黑骨二彷彿在黑暗裏給誰擊了一錘似的，呻吟起來，又抖簌嘴唇說：「也許不會造車路……」</p>
<p>他滿想從兒子臉上找點安慰，然而兒子的臉却是那麽陰沉沉的，像是「黃梅天」的黃昏，一點安慰也找不到。</p>
<p>黑骨二呻吟了一陣，把眼睛朝着門外，毫無主意的裝了一筒烟。旱烟在黑暗裏一刹紅一剎黑。他眼前就像閃着希望的光。</p>
<p>「我可以開一個大價錢，讓衙門買不起，」他盤算着一個很大的價錢，他想開一個大到足把衙門嚇倒的價目。「我討一萬貫錢的價！」</p>
<p>於是他快樂了。「誰願意拿一萬貫錢來買這兩間舊屋和幾十棵黃皮樹呢？……」他想到這裏，略微一笑，於是忘記了開路這回事，和往晚一樣坐到門外去吸烟。……</p>
<p>「沒有錢，這是你送給公家的！」終於，在黃皮花開的一個初夏，黑骨二的希望，給這鐵一般的聲音打破了。兩條從南到北的很闊的石灰綫，就决定了他以後的生活，命運。</p>
<p>動手築路時，黑骨二眞心痛如割。望着自己從上祖傳到手裏的屋園，不是為自己沒出息賣掉，而是給汽車路佔去。……他整日整夜的哭喊。遇着路人就吿說。那樣子完全像一個瘋子。</p>
<p>現在，黃皮又結子了。左近的人家的黃皮園裹，每一棵樹上，挑着一簇簇的黃皮，在黃昏的夕陽裏，發着驕傲的，然而天眞的傻笑。一陣風掠過，樹枝便搖晃着，一簇簇的黃皮，擠擠擁擁，好像一個盛大的集會塲上的萬頭攅動。</p>
<p>黑骨二望着，想起自已的從前的黃皮園。——可不是，往年這個時候，正可以有好收入，那會像現在的有朝沒晚？他把烟筒挾在腋下，搔了搔斑白的飄亂的髮絲，便長歎起氣來。挺了挺身子。</p>
<p>眼睛原是老花了，更兼在暮靄裏。看着前面一簇簇的黃皮，忽幻成了無數黃金，流動着，閃爍起雪亮的光彩，在向引誘。這時，眞恨不得一手抓來身邊，抱個滿懷！卽使黃金把自己壓死了，也是甘心的。然而，眠睛略為一霎，無數的黃金又變成黃皮啦。</p>
<h3 id="c193">冷水浴（一） <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 耳禾</p>
<p>我是從鄉村長大的，在做孩子的時候酷愛着冷水浴。從混入都市後，纔知道有游泳這件事，其實，游泳和冷水浴有什麽不同呢？游泳是都市上的時髦的名字，冷水浴是鄉村的素樸的名字。游泳在都市上為人人所羨慕的，當作一個近代的男子或女子假若不會游泳那是如何的够不上資格。然而冷水浴在鄕村却不大惹起大人們的注意的，他們以為這只是撈魚摸蟹者的事情，一個不幹撈魚摸蟹的人為什麽要洗冷水浴呢？因此，一個富家子弟被大人阻止着沒有洗冷水浴的機會了。但貧家的兒子父母對他的生命比較看得輕一點，同時為了謀生上（夏天沒有事，他們可入水撈魚摸蟹以得利）方便起見，却有洗冷水浴的機會　。然而孩子的性情畢竟是相同的，卽使是富家子弟對於洗冷水浴總是很嚮往的，因此，頑强一點的，勇敢一點的便在這種情形下也學會洗冷水浴了。然而大人們總愛說：</p>
<p>「這孩子，不讀讀書，學學大人樣，一天到晚浸在水裏幹這沒出息的事情！」</p>
<p>然而孩子們偏偏要洗，這一顆熱的心大概同都市人之於游泳沒有什麽不同吧？自己在做孩子的時候是最高興洗冷水浴的，然而我是一個獨子，常常給大人們關着不准我到溝沿去玩。可是我一遇機會便偸偸地去。為了這，十分鍾愛我的父母也忍心地打過我幾下的，他們以為這樣可以使我成個安分的孩子了。然而我還是要偸偷地到溝沿上去看許多孩子洗冷水浴，想看出他們的道理以便自已也能够和他們一樣自由地浮沉。</p>

<h3 id="c198">和陳傳霖君談拍影 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 欣</p>
<p>—陳盧二屆拍影合展</p>
<p>陳傳霖，盧施福兩先生的第二屆拍影合展，己從二十日起開始在大新公司四樓公　展覽　，時間自上午九時起至下午七時止。</p>
<p>關於這次展覽的作品，我在拍影藝術方面　門外漢，不便下什麽評語，况且各人愛好不同，所以最好的辦法，還是讓愛好拍影藝術者自己去看。至於這裏所記述的，是我跟陳傳霖君在會場內所談的一些關於攝影的談話。</p>
<p>在陳君的作品中，我覺得可以稱道的是他的對於近代建築的嘔歌，和對民間生活的正規，雖然在他的作品中，同樣是有「欵乃一聲山水緣」之類的東西，然而一般的說來，這種傾向是很少的。</p>
<p>每一個偉大的藝術家，他决不是給有間者靠間，給他們拍一些供在書房，會客室的裝飾品，他　　站在時代的新綫，正視着民間的疚苦，來給他們呼喊不平，在這國難日亟的目前，　着如火如茶的愛國運動，他也應該出死人生的　興，用開麥拉來紀錄當時的實情，關於這一點，陳君說：國家興亡，匹夫有責，我們是很願意做去的，但是因爲現在的一般攝影愛　者，大都是業餘硏究的緣故！爲了職業的牽　，很難有機會恭興其盛，就是平時想到鄕間　搜集一些拍影題材吧，也往往事與願違，不　易達到，所以，以目前說來，我們是祇能存這麽一個心願：多拍一些與國家，社會有關的照片，至於能否做到呢，那祇能看有沒有機會了。</p>
<p>之後，他領我看了遍他們這次展覽的作品，關於他自己的作品，他舉出二幅作品來作例，說明他拍拍時是怎樣把它攝成的。</p>
<p>第一幅是八十九號「翠微深處」，這是幅利用頂光拍的一張，他說，往常，我們都知道頂光是最不適宜於拍影的燈光，然而也有例外的，例如這一幅，我便是利用頂光而拍的，因爲在平時，後而山的背景總是有光照到，惟有在正午，山扌是全黑的，我這幅東西，使是利用這　機會而拍的。</p>
<h3 id="c199">「明月奇案」 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>南京映</p>
<p>第二幅是七十三　·照片，是好多隻大大小小的雞在一　啄食·很能　　慈愛的精神，據陳君說，拍這幅東西的時候，我在角度上是很費了番心機的，因爲如果平拍了，在視覺上一定會覺得很平，而如果俯拍呢，幾隻雞一定有會很散漫的，考慮的結果中，我便用四十五度的斜角來完成它，等洗出來的結果，雖不敢說怎樣的好，但在自己却也覺得很滿意。</p>
<p>以後我們還談到些別的，但爲了節省篇幅，就從略罷。</p>

<p>美國通用汽車公司是世界上數一數二的大汽車廠，資本鉅大，出品衆多，這是誰都不加否認的，他們的老巢在美國，可是所造的車子行遍天下，這還不算數，除了新大陸的總廠之外，全球各地的分廠支店，倒也不在少數，因之有些人稱他們為「普天下」的，却不是沒意思的恭維呢。</p>
<p>通用公司在各地所設的支廠，有些是規模很大的，每年的營業數額也極可觀，他們設支廠的目標，不僅可使當地的買主，因為减少入口稅和利用所在地的原料而减輕成本的兩個綠故，在價格方面自然獲得便宜，而另一方面呢，他們又儘量僱用當地的工人，勞資雙方都蒙到一種相互的益利，現在且把他們許多廠中的一廠，在印度的通用汽車有限公司，和正在計劃中的澳洲新廠，紀在下面，以覘一斑。</p>
<p>在印度，近年來有許多人覺得應該有汽車製造公司，雖然加爾喀得公司的不幸遭際，但是這種需要仍未稍衰，通用（印度）有限公司，可說是應了這種需要而崛起的有力組織呢，通用廠址在休里地方，他們深覺愉快的，就是能在當地找到機械和辦事的各種人才工員等，我們看了下面的數目字，就可視此為一種有利於印度的有力明證，在通用廠中，百分之九十七的僱員是印度土著，一九三五年公司方面的支出共達三八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇盧比之多。</p>
<p>通用公司在當地設立工廠，不僅解决了印度人的工作問題，對於買主方面也有很多的利益，向來一輛整部汽車，都是裝配齊全了運入印度的，在原料人工和運輸稅金上，都比了在當地配製的費用大，所以據通用公司估計，買主方面所節省的金錢，已達一二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇盧比。</p>
<p>通用公司一九三五年的作業統計如下：</p>
<p>通用汽車公司為發展國外各地的汽車業起見，常因需要向創立新工廠，最近通用汽車公司總董哈耐脫氏稱，「我們深信澳洲今後的繁榮，已經預備在美爾鉢亞拉河岸飛休朋地方，建造一個極大的新工塲」，據說這個通用新工廠的面積，在澳洲地方是數一數二的，廠屋的建築預計六個月可以成功，僱工人數約一，五〇〇〇名，全部的費用達四〇〇，〇〇〇鎊，哈耐脫氏已經向澳洲某鋼鐵廠訂購大宗建築材料，這批定貨的數目是很鉅大的。</p>
<p>澳洲新廠的主要工房，其面積為九百二十尺乘三百六十尺，全部地位為三三一，二〇〇尺，在廠房中所採用的材料運輸機，架空式和平地式式的兩種都廣為應用，測騐機的裝置更為新穎，在一組轉軸的機器上，可以實行各種道路上的馳車測騐，此外還有一間廣八十尺的測騐地穴，各種車輛的最後一步測騐工作，就在這個地方舉行。</p>
<p>工廠所裝置的各種機器，大半是很新式的，有些還是在澳洲初次看見的，其中如車身髹漆工程部，利用空氣調節的新原理，車身在經過一層一層的上漆工作後，再經過相當的烘焙。</p>

<p>速度表着色之提議　各國大都市中交通管理上習用之綠黃紅三色燈。在車輛交通安全上為用極廣。現有人提議。在汽車速度表上亦用此三種顏色。俾駕駛者於汽車速率增進時得隨時加以注意。着色之速度表。由每小時速度零至三十英里為綠色。每小時三十英里至五十英里為黃色。五十英里以上為紅色。據提議者言。速度表如分此三種顏色。則駕駛者於針尖由黃色指向紅色時。勢必受一種心靈上之作用而加以注意。此議之倡導人為伊利諾州潘利亞地方之斯塔舍博士。渠常有一種口號。謂「最好針頭不要指向紅色」。</p>
<p>婦人駕駛汽車紀錄　滬埠美僑米勒夫人。前偕其女公子駕車作橫越美洲之舉。以六日之時間。完成由華盛頓至樂士安極立斯三〇四三英里之行程。其所駕者為潑萊茅斯。途中除車胎被刺外。一無障碍發生。六日間之行程分誌如下。第一日上午六時半出發華盛頓四〇七英里。第二日七時三刻勃立斯篤爾四七八英里。第三日六時三刻甲克遜四五四英里。第四日六時三刻勃里順山四三〇英里。第五日六時三刻大泉五一六英里。第六日四時勞士堡七五八英里。最後一日之行程其駕駛之時間最久。據聞米勒夫人從未連續作兩小時之駕駛。而是日則以十九小時行七百五十八英里。除進食添油及休息外。每小時平均行四十英里。足見婦人非不能作持久之駕駛也。</p>
<p>美國汽車百分比率　美國汽車向以數量衆多甲於全球。此其緣故有三。　美國為汽車之最大出產地。我人均知底特羅汽車廠林立。產車年以數百萬輛計。出產旣富流行自廣也。　汽車售價在國較為低廉。故中人之家均得購置。用為日常代步之品。不以奢侈品視之。至富有之家則置車三四輛者。更數見不鮮。合全國以計之為數自屬可觀也。　美國公路良好。路綫極長。且為汽油之產地原動力與使用地均先人一等。自以為用更廣矣。近據波士頓第一國民銀行統計。目下美合衆國之汽車註册統計為二四，八四〇，〇〇〇輛。實佔全世界汽車註冊數之百分之七十二云。</p>

<p>安全事項　廠房全部以鉛皮鋼骨建築。不易引火。引擎。發動機。機器輪齒都是有相當防護。發電間則遠隔工塲。以免危險。聞自開工至今。三年內。未有發生因工作意外的死亡。</p>
<p>衛生事項　最使我們腦海不忘記的。就是該工塲淸潔之現象。工塲地上絕無骯髒與油垢。簡直淸潔到不像所工塲。大概是日人愛好潔凈的普遍性和工廠管理嚴密的表現。工塲是倣效最新式平梯形的建築。光綫充足。空氣流通。此外還設有工人大食堂。</p>
<p>人事管理　最令人醒目的。工人穿着一律制服。秩序井然。工作時甚勤勞而且活潑。少有倦態。工人皆外宿。祗在廠中午膳。工人無正式團體或公會等。祇有平和會和體育會之組織。據云平和會乃工友疾病扶持凶吉相助的性質。凡雇用新工。必須受相當訓練才開始工作云。</p>

<p>參觀歷三小時之久。始得完竣。雖不敢說該廠盡善盡美。而以三年之建樹。有如此偉大組織。完善管理。實難能可貴。不能不對彼邦人士對於工業的努力。表示萬分敬佩。然料若無政府竭力保護補助與提倡。新興工業。萬難一旦如斯急激的進展。這足見彼邦政府對於工業。尤其是關於軍需重工業提倡的熱誠。反觀我國情况。實不堪設想。</p>
<p>厥後。記者曾詢問領導者。該廠最近計劃增製大型自動車否。據云，彼邦市塲需要大量小型自動車，加以政府方面對於小型車製造。特殊鼓勵與提倡。如特准免考騐駕駛條例。卽凡滿十六歲以上之男女。准許自由駕駛小型自動車。槪免駕駛考騐。復减輕小型自動車牌照稅及准許不須車房等規定。以保障該項工業之發展。更因大型車銷量較少，出品成本過昻。恐不能與美國輸入相頡頏。但在必要時或戰時。該廠可隨時製造大型自動車。以代外來品並同時可改製軍用戰車。鐵甲車。鐵甲列車的可能云云。願我當局與同胞注意之。（完）</p>

President Chiang specially replied to Han and Song on the 23rd. The original telegram and the Han-Song telegram (21st) are recorded below: Tianjin, Committee Member Song Mingxuan, Jinan, Chairman Han Xiangfang, Your Excellencies, The words in your telegram are earnest and sincere, and I admire them very much. The country is in difficulty, and the Central Government is cautiously supporting it. This has been the case for some time. In order to make a more solemn decision on the current policy, the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee has been scheduled and will be held soon. All parties' opinions can be put forward for discussion. At this time, the country should never start disputes on its own. The Central Government will only act with sincerity and strive for unity. For all provincial comrades, we will treat each other with sincerity and openness. All troops will be used to defend the territory and maintain order. There is no intention to start a civil war in the slightest. This is not just empty words, but the truth, which should be seen by all enlightened people in the country. Since Guangdong and Guangxi have mobilized troops to enter neighboring provinces, various documents have been exchanged, requesting the Central Government to effectively stop it. The Central Government still adheres to its original intention and strives to avoid internal conflict, and sincerely explains to Guangdong and Guangxi to dispel misunderstandings. All of these efforts to seek peace and consolidate the foundation of the country are from the bottom of my heart. As you can see, it is in line with the suggestions in your telegram and we agree on the same point. I, Zhongzheng, dare not lag behind others in loving the country. As long as I have a breath, I will never be at ease. I will do my best until I die. I only hope that all gentlemen in Guangdong and Guangxi will share this intention and not engage in internal strife. Then, even if the national crisis is serious, things can still be done. I cannot express my hope in this telegram. Chiang Kai-shek. To the National Government, all ministries and departments, Your Excellencies, The national crisis is serious, and dissenting voices have been rising recently. If internal war were to break out, the people would be devastated, the national strength would be depleted day by day, comrades would feel guilty, and all nations would laugh at us. Zheyuan waits to be punished in the border areas, and is worried that there will be no day to be submerged. He has to cry out in appeal first. He begs you to cherish the people and stop military action on all sides as soon as possible, and strive to help each other sincerely. It would be very fortunate for the overall situation.

<p>(Beiping) When the Japanese army held a flag-conferring ceremony for the garrison regiment in Beiping this morning, it temporarily occupied a part of Beiping. The flag was presented by the Japanese Emperor and was sent from Tokyo last night. During the ceremony, one section of Jiaomin Lane was surrounded by sentries, and only Japanese people were allowed to walk on the sidewalks of the two main streets outside Jiaomin Lane, and no one else was allowed to approach. Those who disobeyed were forcibly expelled. The wife of a certain officer in the French Embassy guard argued with a Japanese soldier, and one of the Japanese soldiers stabbed the woman with a bayonet, only one inch away from the woman's clothing. The Japanese officers and soldiers lined up numbered about 2,500, and the brigade commander Kawabe received the salute. Most of the spectators on the side of the road were Japanese. There were only a few Chinese onlookers. Many Japanese expatriates wore morning dress. It is heard that on the street where the Japanese soldiers were gathering in the square, many Chinese people were beaten by Japanese soldiers. Another American officer, dressed in civilian clothes, was also almost stabbed by a Japanese soldier with a bayonet. When the man stood on the street to watch, a Japanese soldier stepped forward and ordered him to retreat. When the Japanese soldier saw that he did not move, he stabbed him in the abdomen with the tip of a knife. The military officer quickly pushed aside the Japanese soldier's hand holding the bayonet, and the Japanese soldier retreated. It is said that the Japanese soldiers' behavior was due to the firm belief that Japanese military officer Sasaki had recently been beaten to death by British soldiers, so they held a sense of resentment towards foreigners.

<p>(Tianjin) Ishii talked about the development of the North China economy, the Japanese military will assist within its power with the state policy carried by the ambassador to China. The military does not have an economic advisory department, but five public generals are responsible for such matters. The plan has not been finalized. Ambassador Kawagoe advocates developing the North China economy, but how to start is a matter for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the military does not know. From a personal observation, the development of the economy must have large funds and a stable political situation. At the moment, both of these are not easy to achieve, and it seems too early to talk about it now. China has extremely rich resources, Jin coal and Shandong iron, but they are all buried underground due to inconvenient transportation. The military deeply hopes to help the other country build railways and roads to gradually seek development. The construction plan for the Cangshi Road has not been decided, and it is being studied whether to build Cangshi or Jinshi. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Lieutenant Colonel Ishii, a staff officer of the Japanese Garrison in North China, said that Commander Tashiro went to Beiping today to confer flags on the 1st Regiment stationed there and to visit various parties. As for diplomatic matters, since the important people of Hebei and Chahar are all in Tianjin, there is no need to negotiate with them there. He will return tomorrow. Vice Chief of Staff Imamura of the Kwantung Army has left Beiping for Chengde and returned to his post via that route. The recent troop movements of the Yutang army were to go to Beiping to listen to instructions and participate in the flag-conferring ceremony. Some of them have already returned to their defenses. It is by no means a new team. The Fengtai barracks has not been completed, and the troops camping along the Beining line have slowed down. There is no intention for the Japanese army in North China to expand the air force and send more planes, nor is there a plan to build an airfield at Juetai in Tongzhou. It seems that these rumors are still made up by ambitious conspirators who want to profit from them. The press should explain this to avoid the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations and Chinese people instigating discord. The Japanese ship Dairong Maru in Qikou was shot at by a customs anti-smuggling ship. It is said that this was due to a misunderstanding between the two sides. The two ships were too far apart. Dairong Maru suspected that the patrol boat was a pirate ship, and the patrol boat suspected that Dairong Maru was a smuggling ship, so it opened fire. By the time they approached, it was too late for each to understand. The customs has sent personnel to the consulate to explain the misunderstanding, and the issue will not be expanded.

<h3 id="e22">Abyssinian Army Continues Resistance <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>During this period when the League of Nations is proceeding with the lifting of sanctions against Italy, we are greatly encouraged to hear the news that the Abyssinian army continues to resist.</p>
<p>Judging from the situation in all aspects of Abyssinia's past defeat, the main reason was entirely the error in strategy. If Abyssinia did not fight the Italian army head-on with a dense force, but adopted a decentralized and mobile guerrilla tactic, it would have been able to last longer. Although the two major cities of Abyssinia's capital and Harar are in the hands of the Italian army, according to British Foreign Secretary Eden's recent report to the House of Commons, the Abyssinian territory occupied by the Italian army is still less than half of the entire country. In fact, most of the Abyssinian people have not been truly conquered by Italy. As long as the remaining Abyssinian army can unite and change the past erroneous strategy and continue to resist the Italian army, the future should not be completely hopeless. According to a recent Reuters dispatch, the people in the western part of Abyssinia are preparing to resist the Italian army at any cost. If the Italian army advances westward, the Abyssinian people will use guerrilla warfare to resist. Another message said that the Italian army has only occupied a few major towns in Abyssinia. Between these towns, most of the land has not been conquered by the Italian army, and the local people are openly resisting the Italian rule. Although the main road from Abyssinia's capital to Taisi is occupied by the Italian army, the Italian column cannot be safe on the road. As for the western and southern parts of Abyssinia, the Italian army does not dare to go deep. Another message said that Abyssinia's finances are very chaotic. The road bureau officials are even unwilling to accept the Italian lira paid by the Italian army for transporting troops and supplies.</p>
<p>From these situations, we can at least recognize the following points: Most of Abyssinia is still in a state of chaos, and it is certainly very difficult for Italy to maintain its military rule. The Abyssinian people are still determined to continue their resistance. The Abyssinian army has changed its strategy and adopted guerrilla warfare. This strategy can cause great damage to the Italian army at any time. The financial chaos in Italy will inevitably affect its aggression and rule.</p>
<p>In short, we cannot yet say that Abyssinia is beyond saving, nor can we be optimistic about Italy, which is boasting of its victory. Under the circumstances that the Abyssinian army continues to resist, the restoration of Abyssinia is not absolutely impossible.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Central Observatory Corrects "Planet Will Collide with Earth" Claim - Still Far from Earth's Orbit, No Collision Possible - Startling Words Are Absolutely Untrustworthy <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the "Prediction of Planet Colliding with Earth" reported in Shanghai newspapers recently, the Central News Agency reporter specifically inquired with the Central Observatory about the scientific basis of this prediction. The reply was as follows: The first half of this news is still close to the facts, but the latter half deliberately makes startling claims, which are completely untrustworthy. It is true that astronomer Baade discovered a small planet on a photograph on the night of February 12th this year. After calculation, it was known that it could enter within the Earth's orbit and be closer to the Earth than any planet or comet, setting a new record for near-Earth stars. Currently, there is little observation data, so the orbits calculated by various institutions cannot be completely consistent, but the eccentricity is generally very large, and the angle of inclination between the orbital plane and the ecliptic is quite small. Most importantly, the point of intersection with the ecliptic is quite far from the Earth's orbit. Therefore, according to the currently calculated orbital situation, there is no possibility of colliding with the Earth. Even if the orbit changes over time, the chance of collision is very remote and difficult to encounter. As for the rumored prediction by the Harvard University Observatory that it will collide in September next year, unless the reporter deliberately exaggerated the story, it must be due to a misunderstanding. Although there has been no news from Harvard University recently, reports from a few months ago only contained common knowledge about the orbit of the star, which is largely the same as what was announced by the Belgian Astronomical Society. It is even more untrustworthy to say that the collision will occur in a certain place. Because the observation data for this type of small star is extremely scarce, the calculated number of days in the period cannot be accurate, let alone determine the location of the collision. In recent years, there have been repeated rumors of the end of the world and the destruction of the moon, mostly exploiting the public's curiosity to make speculative and absurd claims. All our people do not need to worry unnecessarily. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<h3 id="e28">Contents of New Straits Draft Proposed by Turkey <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Montreux, Switzerland - Turkey has recently proposed a new convention to replace the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. Its content advocates: All warships and auxiliary vessels, except submarines, shall be free to pass through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits. Any country wishing to pass its warships through the straits shall notify the Turkish government through diplomatic channels one month in advance. Any country that is not on the coast of the Black Sea is allowed to pass through the straits with a maximum of one cruiser and two destroyers, and their tonnage shall not exceed 14,000 tons. Furthermore, the total tonnage of warships from countries not on the coast of the Black Sea that are docked in the Black Sea shall not exceed 28,000 tons, and their stay shall not exceed 15 days. No military or civilian aircraft may fly over the straits. When these aircraft enter the Black Sea, they shall follow the route designated by the Turkish government. The draft does not specifically stipulate the re-establishment of defenses in the straits, but only states that the Treaty of Lausanne will be invalidated after the signing of the new convention, which implies permission to establish defenses. All clauses of the new convention shall not be misinterpreted or extended in their original meaning, so as not to harm Turkey's sovereignty. The new convention shall be ratified by the signatory countries of the Treaty of Lausanne, and the ratification documents of these countries shall be deposited in the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs archives in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the Treaty of Lausanne.

<h3 id="e29">Signatory Countries of the Treaty of Lausanne Hold Closed Meeting - Discussing Turkey's New Agreement Draft - Russia Wants the Black Sea to Become a Blockaded Zone - Italy's Attitude of Opposition to Changing the Treaty Remains Unchanged <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Montreux, Switzerland - The Lausanne Conference held its first closed meeting this morning. Secretary-General Rushdi, the Turkish Foreign Minister, briefly described the new agreement draft proposed by Turkey (see separate dispatch) and then submitted it for discussion. People in the conference lounge claimed that the Italian government had sent a note to the Turkish government yesterday, stating that it could not send representatives to attend the meeting. As of this morning, the Turkish delegation had not announced it. The reason is that the Turkish Foreign Minister hopes that the Italian government can withdraw or amend this note so that its wording is more moderate. However, news from Rome this morning stated that the Italian government's opposition to revising the Treaty of Lausanne has not changed. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Le Sépey, Switzerland - At the closed meeting of the Lausanne Conference this morning, Secretary-General Rushdi, the Turkish Foreign Minister, immediately read the note sent by the Turkish government, which stated that it could not send representatives, and expressed the hope that the Italian delegation could still participate in time. The British delegation, led by the Minister of Public Works Sir Stanhope, asked Lord Herbert to speak after him, stating that the United Kingdom accepts the new agreement draft proposed by Turkey in principle. The Japanese representative, Sato, the Japanese Ambassador to France, also made a similar statement, but he must wait for detailed instructions from his government before he can take further action. Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov said that his country is willing to accept the new agreement draft, but his country's fleet must be able to sail from one sea to another, and he hopes that this aspect will not be ignored in the new agreement draft. In addition, representatives from France, Romania, Greece, and Yugoslavia also expressed their acceptance. The meeting decided to submit it for discussion and appointed two committees, one drafting committee and one technical committee, to carry out the work separately, and scheduled to continue the meeting this afternoon. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) News received here this morning from Montreux said that Turkish and Soviet Russian representatives had a minor dispute on the conference floor. Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov was clearly not entirely satisfied with the draft treaty proposed by Turkey. The Soviet Union's agreement stipulates that the Soviet Union and countries bordering the Black Sea can send warships of 25,000 tons to enter and exit the Dardanelles Strait. It is said that the Soviet Union also wants the Black Sea to become a blocked zone, and no foreign ships are allowed to sail through the Bosphorus Strait. According to the mutual assistance agreement between the Soviet Union and France, the freedom of the strait is of utmost importance to the Soviet Russian fleet, and the Soviet Russian point of view will definitely benefit France. The general impression is that the scope of work of this conference will be far greater than what is currently planned. It is widely believed that various countries will hold a general conference on Mediterranean security due to the straits agreement. When the meeting opened today, Bruce, the Australian Commissioner to London, was elected chairman. This move attracted much attention. Informed observers said that Bruce's election showed that during the discussion, the defense issues of the British Empire would definitely be placed at the forefront. From a historical point of view, this move is also very interesting, because the Australian army was the first to attack the Dardanelles Strait during the European War. This morning, after the representatives completed all the items on the agenda, they held a closed meeting to consider the draft agreement proposed by Turkey. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Montreux - The representatives of the Dardanelles Strait Conference have all expressed their readiness to accept the Turkish draft as the basis for discussion, but most of the representatives have also expressed their intention to reserve some points for amendments to the treaty. Sir Stanhope, the Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom, today drew the attention of the public to the fact that the treaty did not mention the re-establishment of military defenses in the straits, which is what the British government sympathizes with. Earl Stanhope also said that the Strait Committee was not mentioned, therefore the principle that an international committee should not conflict with Turkey's rights over the international waterway should not be abandoned.

<h3 id="e30">Opening Day of the Conference: Speeches by Representatives of Various Countries. Acknowledging the Demands for Peace and Legality; Unanimously Expressing Willingness to Sincerely Consider <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Mondreux, Switzerland. The Montreux Conference opened here at 4:15 PM today. First, Mr. Motta, Head of the Political Department of the Swiss Federal Government, delivered an opening address as the host. He stated that the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 was one of the most important diplomatic documents of recent times. The Turkish government's request for revision through proper means and peaceful procedures is commendable. "The main issue now is to restore Turkish sovereignty while not conflicting with general interests and international commercial interests. What I hope from the Montreux Conference is nothing other than enhanced mutual trust among nations, which will alleviate the current state of unrest in Europe," he said.</p>
<p>Next, Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü Aras briefly explained the demands made by his country and defended them carefully. He stated that the current system of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits was stipulated by the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 and jointly guaranteed by Great Britain, France, Italy, and Japan (because the Turkish government at the time did not consider the collective security that the League of Nations could provide to be satisfactory). However, as time has passed, it is undeniable that the joint guarantee by the four countries is difficult to realize effectively. Defending national territory is the basic right of any country, an eternal and unchanging principle. The lack of defenses in the straits contradicts this principle and should not be maintained.</p>
<p>Then, Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu spoke, stating that he assured that all countries would earnestly study Turkey's demands through negotiations. He also stated that while the straits are vital to Turkey, they also have a close relationship with Romania. He mentioned the Balkan Entente, stating that Romania and other countries are signatories and that their interests are intertwined. Finally, he said that the Turkish government's adherence to legal procedures and treaty obligations is admirable.</p>
<p>At this point, Lord Stanhope, the British Public Works Minister, rose to speak, mentioning the German issue and criticizing Germany's recent unilateral abrogation of the Locarno Treaties, stating that this was the reason why the general situation in Europe had not improved. He also stated that the Montreux Conference was the result of the unsuccessful Disarmament Conference and the difficulties encountered by the League of Nations. In short, since international conferences have failed, countries have no choice but to rely on their own strength for their own security. Therefore, Turkey's demands are reasonable, and the British government will sincerely study them. Finally, he said, "We have always believed that the obligation to abide by international treaties is the cornerstone of diplomatic relations, but we have recently witnessed the unilateral abrogation of treaties."</p>
<p>Former French Minister without Portfolio Pierre-Étienne Flandin followed Stanhope and praised the Turkish government's legal steps, saying, "It is commendable that the Turkish government prefers to follow peaceful procedures rather than violating treaties. France will also seriously study Turkey's demands."</p>
<p>Then, Soviet Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov spoke, saying, "The Dardanelles Strait, in the eyes of the Soviet Union, is the vital nerve center of the nation." He continued, "Looking back to the time of the Lausanne Conference in 1923, Europe was just emerging from the devastation of the Great War. The policies of various countries were beginning to adjust, and people generally held peaceful illusions. No government dared to openly advocate war. But today, the situation has greatly changed. Nationalism is rampant, and deceit and distrust prevail. Some countries are openly preparing for war and propagating war without any scruples. Looking around the world, it is not difficult to distinguish between those who love peace and those who love war. The Turkish nation's love of peace is well-known to the world. The facts are clear and undeniable. Therefore, the Soviet Union will study Turkey's demands with a deep understanding and a spirit of compromise."</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador to France Sato followed Litvinov and said that the Japanese government fully understands Turkey's motives. "The Japanese government fully understands the Turkish government's motives." "It is necessary to reconsider some of the provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne regarding the straits issue. As a signatory and guarantor of the treaty, Japan is fully aware of this. Therefore, it is prepared to participate in cooperation on this issue and sympathizes with the outline of Turkey's proposed new convention (see separate dispatch). However, since Japan has now withdrawn from the League of Nations, it cannot participate in the implementation of certain clauses of the new convention."</p>
<p>Afterward, Greek representative Politis, Yugoslav representative Soubbotitch, and Bulgarian representative Nikolaev all spoke, praising Turkey's diplomatic policies and stating that their respective countries were willing to consider the issue of revising the Treaty of Lausanne.</p>
<p>Finally, British representative Bruce, the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, was elected as chairman, Greek representative Politis, the Greek Minister to France, was elected as vice-chairman, and Avenol, head of the Disarmament Section of the League of Nations, was elected as deputy secretary-general. It was decided to hold a closed-door meeting tomorrow to discuss the Turkish draft, and then the meeting was adjourned. (Havas, December 12th)</p>

<p>The Italian newspaper Il Messaggero recently commented on the Montreux Conference, stating, "The impact of Turkey's demand to re-establish defenses in the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits is greater than generally imagined. The Turkish government made this request because the threat of war in the Mediterranean now exists, and they are acting accordingly. However, as far as Italy is concerned, Prime Minister Mussolini has repeatedly stated that the Abyssinian issue should be limited to a colonial issue and not be allowed to transform into a European issue. Therefore, one of the motives for Turkey's request has no basis. The Montreux Conference has now begun, and Italy does not intend to send representatives to attend the conference but adopts a reserved attitude. This attitude should be regarded as a warning, namely that any resolution will be deemed invalid by Italy if it has not obtained Italy's consent," etc. (Havas, December 22nd)</p>

<p>(Paris) Regarding Italy's policy on the revision of the Treaty of Lausanne, Madame Tabouis, the diplomatic correspondent of the L'Œuvre newspaper, sent a commentary from Montreux, Switzerland, yesterday, which was published by the newspaper. It stated, "It was learned here yesterday that the Italian government had firmly urged the German government to wait until the League of Nations General Assembly in September to respond to the British questionnaire. The reason is that 'although we have achieved our goal regarding the lifting of sanctions, we cannot be complacent. Britain and France, as well as other small countries, must recognize the de facto annexation of Abyssinia before we can accept the Mediterranean Pact that they are planning to conclude.' Subsequently, a long-distance telephone call from London also reported to here that the British Embassy in Germany had also reported to the Foreign Office that Germany's response would likely be sent out around September. This news came from two places, unexpectedly coinciding, indicating that Italy had indeed contacted Germany. It is reported that the French Foreign Office is unhappy with Italy's actions, considering it a disregard for Britain. The representatives of various countries here were also shocked upon hearing this, believing that the Italian government intends to use the answer that Germany should provide to pressure Britain and France. The reason is that as long as Germany does not provide an answer, Britain and France cannot feel at ease. Italy can maintain its current favorable position and utilize it, without having to quickly choose one side between Britain, France, and Germany." (Havas, December 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e33">Rumor that the Soviet Union is Preparing to Propose a Shocking Suggestion; Demanding that Russian Vessels Freely Pass Through the Straits; Italy Will Naturally Express Opposition <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>(London) News from Geneva claims that the Soviet government is about to propose a demand to the Montreux Conference, stating that Soviet warships and troops should have the right to freely pass through the Dardanelles Strait. Diplomatic circles here were greatly shocked upon hearing this, believing that if this news is confirmed, the situation of the Montreux Conference will completely change, and the balance of power in the Mediterranean will be greatly affected. Italian sources here also said that this Soviet demand is the most important factor in the Montreux Conference, which the Italian government must oppose. According to the Turkish draft for the new convention, the restrictions on warships passing through the straits only limit the tonnage of warships entering the Black Sea, while not mentioning the tonnage of warships sailing from the Black Sea into the Mediterranean (referring to Russian warships). People in London have already expressed surprise. Now that they hear that the Soviet Union is proposing the above demand, they suspect that the Soviet Union and Turkey may have been in contact beforehand. (Havas, December 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e34">Predictions for the Future of the Conference; Regarding the Issue of Restricting Warship Passage; British and Russian Opinions are Diametrically Opposed <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Montreux, Switzerland. A special dispatch from our correspondent at the Montreux Conference highlights two key points from the first day of meetings. Firstly, the countries that participated in the 1923 Lausanne Conference could not reach a consensus, but at the Montreux Conference, the representatives of various countries seem to be moving towards a compromise solution. Secondly, the representatives of various countries unanimously praised Turkey's peaceful and legal procedures and viewed Germany's unilateral abrogation of the Locarno Treaty as an illegal and violent act containing great danger. Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov strongly criticized Germany's actions, which was supported by British representative Stanhope and French representative Flandin. Overall, the countries unanimously agree with Turkey's re-establishment of defenses in the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits, so this should not be a problem. However, it is difficult to reach a compromise on the issues of restricting warship passage and prohibiting aircraft from flying over the straits, and various technical issues need to be thoroughly discussed. For example, the British and Russian opinions on the warship tonnage limit in the Turkish draft are clearly diametrically opposed. Britain does not want to see a fleet (referring to the Russian fleet) suddenly sail out of the Black Sea, disrupting the balance of power in the Mediterranean. Generally, it is believed that once the conference work has made significant progress, various fundamental issues will gradually be exposed. At that time, the importance of the conference will increase accordingly. After the sanctions are lifted and Italy joins the conference, it will definitely become more interesting.

<h3 id="e35">The New French Government Announces its Foreign Policy; Advocating the Reconstruction of the Collective Security Mechanism; Revising the Covenant to Make it Truly Effective; Willing to Seek a Basis for Compromise with Germany to Clarify the European Situation <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Premier Léon Blum delivered a statement on foreign policy in the Senate at 3:00 PM today, stating that France intends to reconstruct the collective security mechanism, hoping that "the great democratic nation of England" will support it, and hoping that "the democratic nation of America across the Atlantic can offer sincere support." Regarding the issue of lifting sanctions against Italy, I have accepted it. He also stated that peace is indivisible, but the strengthening of the collective security mechanism does not necessarily require the revision of the League of Nations Covenant. It is sufficient if important revisions can be made to the text, so that the provisions of the Covenant can be effectively implemented, and its interpretation does not give rise to doubts. Regarding this, I believe that when an act of aggression occurs, countries neighboring the aggressor or countries with the same interests should form a group and devote their full strength to resistance, while other member states should uniformly implement economic and financial sanctions to assist them. "If the implementation of Article 16 of the Covenant in this way still cannot stop the act of aggression, then the various measures stipulated in the original article should still be fully implemented." The Premier then mentioned the peace declaration made by German Chancellor Adolf Hitler, stating, "Mr. Hitler is a veteran of the war, and his words are credible, and we have no doubt." However, he hopes that the answer that the German government should provide to the British questionnaire can clarify the European situation. In this regard, France is willing to find a basis for compromise with Germany. In addition, European countries should form a committee based on the "European Union Plan" proposed by the late French Premier Aristide Briand to consider the possibility of mutual union among European countries and to consider the general economic situation of Europe and the special needs of various nations, so that international trade can be revived. Finally, the Premier proposed that a permanent committee should be established in Geneva to disclose as much information as possible regarding the manufacturing and sale of armaments. (Havas, December 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos spoke in the Chamber of Deputies today, stating that the French public and various parties are willing to be friendly with Germany and expressed that France will support the lifting of sanctions against Italy. This speech was the new government's announcement of its foreign policy, the same as the statement read by Premier Léon Blum in the Senate. The Foreign Minister also mentioned that regional agreement negotiations should be conducted promptly, and a Danube Pact should be concluded by Central European countries. He stated that the British government's questions on Hitler's peace plan have not yet been answered. France intends to study Germany's proposals in good faith and seek a basis for compromise, but such a compromise can only be achieved through an indivisible peace that does not harm any country.

<h3 id="e36">Issue of Revising the Covenant; Based on Two Main Principles; French Ambassador Visits Eden for Discussions <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>(London) French Ambassador Corbin held talks with Foreign Secretary Eden this morning. It is reported that he explained to the Foreign Secretary that France is willing to base its revision of the League of Nations Covenant on the following main principles: Firstly, the collective security mechanism of the League of Nations Covenant must be strengthened, but when an act of aggression occurs, the main action to deal with the aggressor should be undertaken by countries neighboring the aggressor and implemented quickly, and then other countries should implement economic sanctions. Secondly, the League of Nations Assembly does not need to be unanimous in designating a country as an aggressor, so as not to delay the process and enable the League of Nations to take action immediately. Regarding the first principle, Britain also seems to agree that countries neighboring the aggressor should take swift action, but it does not agree with forcing distant countries to participate in the action, believing that it is not practically feasible.

<p>(Rome) Austria has effectively recognized Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, as the credentials presented by the Austrian Minister on Sunday addressed the Italian King as "King of Italy and Emperor of Abyssinia." The credentials presented by Egypt, Iran, and Haiti on the same day only addressed him as "King of Italy." (Reuters, December 23rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Recently, four foreign envoys have successively called on the Italian King to present their credentials. Among them, the new Austrian Minister to Italy, former Foreign Minister Guido Schmidt, addressed the Italian King as "His Majesty the King of Italy and Emperor of Abyssinia." Regarding this matter, semi-official sources stated that Italy does not attach importance to the wording used in the credentials of foreign envoys (implying that Italy's annexation of Abyssinia has become an undeniable fact, and the title used for the Italian King in the credentials of foreign envoys is not significant). Foreign Minister Ciano recently met with Japanese Ambassador Sugimura for discussions. (Havas, December 22nd)</p>

<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden announced in the House of Commons today that the government does not want to propose or agree to recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia at today's League of Nations meeting in Geneva. Answering a question from a Member of Parliament, the Foreign Secretary said that he had not heard any news of recent Italian military actions, but according to estimates from about three weeks ago, Italian troops occupied less than half of Abyssinia's territory. However, the occupied territory is the most important part of Abyssinia, including the capital and the two major cities of Harar. Furthermore, all roads connecting with foreign countries, except for one, are also occupied by Italian troops. Regarding other areas, he can only speak of western Abyssinia, which is Abyssinia's only remaining road connecting with foreign countries. According to recent news from the Consul General in Gore, that area has fallen into the hands of the Kara people opposing the imperial government. He heard that the remaining Amhara tribal officials have been unable to exercise authority. As for how many Abyssinian armed forces remain, he cannot estimate the number. If weapons and ammunition entering western Abyssinia from Sudan cannot be guaranteed to be received by the legitimate authorities or cannot be guaranteed not to be used to promote civil war, the British government cannot allow the export of these weapons and ammunition. He has informed the Abyssinian ambassador to London of this situation. The Foreign Secretary also answered another question, stating that if there is a government responsible to the Abyssinian King in western Abyssinia, the issue of transporting weapons and ammunition into Abyssinia will of course be discussed separately.

<p>Philadelphia: The National Democratic Convention will open at noon, beginning with a speech by Committee Chairman and US Postmaster General Farley. The session will extend into the evening, at which time the Governor of Pennsylvania, Earle, will deliver a welcoming address. The delegates will then hear a major speech by Senator Barkley. President Roosevelt is scheduled to arrive here on Saturday or Sunday and will be chosen by popular vote at an open-air rally as the party's presidential candidate. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Philadelphia: The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to open here tomorrow, with most delegates already arrived. According to general consensus, President Roosevelt's re-election, which seemed assured a few months ago, now faces changed circumstances. Strenuous efforts are needed to secure all possible votes before there is hope. The "Old Guard" leader Smith's declaration of war on President Roosevelt, criticisms of the New Deal, and the unbalanced budget are all difficulties encountered at the start of President Roosevelt's campaign. It is widely believed that Smith may invite his friends to support the Republican presidential candidate Landon, and the New Left "Union Party," which has nominated Lemke as its presidential candidate, also appears to be defecting from President Roosevelt. People are now asking if there is any way to prevent the hundreds of thousands of votes supporting President Roosevelt from going to Landon. It is said that the Republican presidential candidate Landon is younger than President Roosevelt, and Hamilton, who leads Landon's campaign, is a capable figure from the Midwest, whose influence cannot be compared with those who ran Hoover's campaign in 1923. However, President Roosevelt's personal appeals to the voters still hold considerable power, and supporters of the New Deal argue that if the criticisms are indeed accurate, then under Landon's proposal for each state to handle its own relief efforts, the situation will inevitably worsen. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Philadelphia, USA: The Democratic National Convention will convene here tomorrow. Delegates are firmly supporting President Roosevelt and his New Deal, resisting the party defection movement advocated by conservatives like Smith. However, the current division within the party is unprecedented since former President Roosevelt obstructed former President Taft in the Republican Party in 1912. Democratic National Committee Chairman and Postmaster General Farley responded to yesterday's statement by Smith and others, stating that it represents the views of organizations such as the American Liberty League. Other party leaders also claim that opposition to President Roosevelt is a futile effort. Farley began party activities at 10 a.m. this morning, convening a meeting of the National Committee. It is rumored that once President Roosevelt is re-nominated, he will resign as Postmaster General to focus on election campaigning. State delegates are also holding caucus meetings today to prepare for voting. The biggest point of contention regarding the platform is that New Deal leaders want to draft a radical anti-trust declaration based on government policy. There are two main keys: one is to win the support of Senator Borah, who also advocates anti-trust, and the other is to prevent farmers who oppose monopolies from turning to Lemke's United Third Party. During today's National Committee meeting, when former Massachusetts Governor Ely and current Georgia Governor Talmadge were called upon, they remained silent, making people deeply feel that opponents of the New Deal are indeed likely to defect. However, Talmadge subsequently stated that he does not intend to leave the Democratic Party, as all issues should be resolved within the party. (National Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>Philadelphia, USA: Political observers familiar with the situation here believe today that the developments of the past two days have forced the Democratic Party to lean to the left. It is said that if President Roosevelt wants to be re-nominated, his platform must surpass that of United Third Party candidate Lemke. The Democratic National Convention's strategy should be to win over Western states by having Senators La Follette, Sheppard, Norris, and others support the New Deal. La Follette is a Progressive, Sheppard is a Labor-Farmer, and Norris is a Progressive Republican. All of them supported Roosevelt in 1932. Today, Roosevelt's camp has gained a glimmer of hope with the support of New York Governor Lehman. Lehman is a close friend of both President Roosevelt and Smith, who has declared his intention to defect. He recently declared that he does not wish to be governor again, and some quarters believe that President Roosevelt will lose a good supporter. Now that he has declared his support, it shows that he is still loyal to the New Deal. (National Press, 22nd)</p>

<p>(London) Today's Times published an article commenting on Sir Frederick Leith-Ross's farewell speech in Shanghai yesterday, stating that the knight's citation of the guarantee he obtained in Tokyo that Japan's intentions toward China were purely out of respect, without criticizing these empty words, shows great insight. The knight is well aware of the disputes involved in Japan's destruction or instigation of the destruction of the Hopei customs, which are extremely detrimental to China and the interests of merchants in China. It is an open secret that the foreign business community is currently fighting a rearguard action in the Far East. The increasing difficulties in doing business in China are gradually being understood and are certainly increasing, and they are exacerbated by the weakness and incompetence of European governments. Observers, whether Easterners or not, feel that various countries now have policies to be implemented in the Far East, or have determined them but cannot implement them. Europe has gradually lost face in the past decade, and although the fault is not its own, it has never failed to have an adverse impact on its interests in China and Japan. Japan has safely excluded foreign interests by opening the door in Manchuria. Recent events in China have appropriately shown that wherever Chinese territory is controlled by Japan, it will taste this. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>

<p>Hangchow Correspondence: Because of the recent continuous rain and mold in counties of the upper reaches of Chien Tang River, mountain floods are erupting, with water flowing downwards with extraordinary impetuosity. The water level of the Chien Tang River is usually only about six meters and forty-five centimeters, but at 7 p.m. on the 22nd, it suddenly rose sharply to eight meters and four centimeters and five centimeters, only a few centimeters below the highest water level of last year. Dyke construction along the river is quite dangerous. The Water Conservancy Engineering Office of the Construction Department has specially ordered the engineering team to pay special attention to protection at all times. The Chien Tang River Bridge project was considerably affected by the great flood last year. On the 22nd, when the fifth caisson of the bridge was under construction, it was suddenly hit by huge waves. The caisson, together with its iron anchor weighing about 800 tons, was swept several miles downstream to Nanshingchiao. The Bridge Construction Office dispatched a small steamer to tow it, but due to the high tide and rapid water, it was almost capsized, and construction had to be stopped. The eleventh caisson on the north bank was also washed away and moved, making construction impossible. As for the pile-driving project, seven of the eight bridge piers have been completed, and only one pier remains. However, all projects must be considerably affected. Fortunately, the water level had dropped several centimeters to eight meters and twenty-five centimeters on the morning of the 23rd, but there is still a tendency to continue to rise when the tide comes in the evening.</p>
<p>East of the 104th breakwater dam on the south bank of the Chien Tang River, the river bank is in danger of collapsing due to repeated attacks by the Chien Tang River tide. The Siaoshan County Government and local people have earnestly requested the Construction Department to find a way to provide relief. After receiving the report, the Construction Department plans to send a team in early next month to measure the shape of the riverbed and riverbank near the east of Hsihsing Wharf, so as to carry out the protection plan. The required survey fee has been approved and allocated. (23rd)</p>

<p>Nanking Correspondence: Land registration in the city districts of Nanking is scheduled to be completed in the 34th year of the Republic. The land in the remaining suburban rural areas, after the provincial and municipal boundaries are drawn, should belong to the municipal area. It covers an area of more than 600,000 mu, accounting for more than 8.5% of the city's area. It is divided into four districts: Yentzuchiao, Shanghsinho, Hsialingwei, and the mausoleum park, most of which is farmland, collectively called the municipal rural area. Previously, although the land in these areas had been reported by Kiangning County, the boundaries had not been clearly demarcated and the land register had not been corrected. In order to complete the consolidation of land throughout the city, the Nanking Municipal Land Administration Bureau plans to continue to conduct land registration in rural areas starting in fiscal year 25. However, since the situation in urban and rural areas is quite different, the procedures must be simplified to avoid protracted delays. It has drafted an outline for handling land registration in rural areas, submitted it for approval and implementation, and is now preparing to conduct triangulation and topographic surveys in each rural area starting in July of this year, and then issue announcements to notify the households in each rural area to conduct surveys on a regular basis. At the same time, prepare a general registration map and begin registration, starting with Shanghsinho and progressing according to the decision, with the aim of completing it within two years.</p>
<p>The Nanking Municipal Government plans to implement the collection of land value tax and land appreciation tax in the registered areas starting in fiscal year 25, with the aim of realizing our party's land policy, equally distributing the burden on citizens, and enriching the funds for municipal construction. It is now engaged in various preparatory tasks. The estimate of land prices will still be handled by the Municipal Government Valuation Committee. Other matters, such as the distinction between tax lands and the setting of tax rates, are also being discussed separately. This plan can be realized in the 25th year of the Republic.</p>
<p>Other matters, such as the planning of land use, the implementation of geological exploration, the clearing of public land, and the compilation of land register maps, are all planned to be held in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The Guangdong provincial authorities, recognizing the escalating urgency of the global situation and the critical importance of air defense equipment, have recently launched an active plan to strengthen the province's overall air defense capabilities, educate the public on air defense knowledge, and practice air defense methods. The implementation steps involve instructing the pacification commissioners in each district to establish air defense committees responsible for all related matters. It has been observed that since their establishment, these committees have been actively training the public in rescue, disinfection, shelter procedures, and the development of transportation, all crucial aspects of air defense work. Cities and towns within these districts have also been actively establishing air defense associations to assist in these efforts. Currently, seventy percent of the counties and cities in the province have established air defense associations, and the remaining counties, cities, districts, and townships are rapidly preparing to establish branch associations, aiming to complete the provincial air defense plan in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Guangdong Imposes a Special Tax on Imported Timber; Ten Percent of the Value Extracted in Addition to Customs Duties, with Discretionary Exemption for Industry-Related Materials <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Starting from the 15th of this month, Guangdong Province has begun collecting a special tax on imported timber. The special tax bureau for imported agricultural products will levy ten percent of the value reported on the customs declaration. It is estimated that this tax will increase monthly revenue by more than 60,000 yuan. The categories of taxable timber are listed below: Timber products include planks, ordinary squared timber (excluding teak and listed timbers), logs, heavy timber, light timber, ordinary sawn timber (including those that are not merely sawn, but not including masts), heavy timber (a) without defects in weight, (b) clean weight suitable for commercial use; light timber, ordinary masts, railway sleepers, teak (beam and plank sections), unlisted timbers, persimmon wood, agarwood, fragrant incense, rosewood, padauk, sandalwood, *Dalbergia tonkinensis*, lignum vitae, fragrant wood, aromatic wood (fragrant firewood), cork, stopper wood, and others (including camphorwood, ebony, *Vitex parviflora*, ironwood, etc.). Japanese wood shavings, decorative wood, various wooden wares and unlisted products including (a) barrels, boxes, cages, and other ordinary packing containers, (b) cork stoppers, (c) furniture, (d) machinery (parts or components), (e) wood chips (for match production), (f) barrel and box staves, (g) matchsticks (for match production), (h) and other types. It is also noted that "heavy timber" refers to timber from coniferous and thorn-leaved trees that produce cones. The imposition of this special tax on imported timber will significantly impact local handicrafts. Industries related to imported timber are actively petitioning for the exclusion of essential items from the tax. Specifically, the newly taxed wood chips and matchsticks are raw materials for the local match industry. As there is a shortage of wood chips and matchsticks domestically, the imposition of this special tax will inevitably affect the match industry. Following requests from match merchants, the Finance Department has approved the exclusion of wood chips and matchsticks from the special tax. Recently, sandalwood merchants petitioned the Finance Department to exempt sandalwood, agarwood, fragrant incense, and fragrant firewood from the special tax, citing the precedent of wood chips and matchsticks to support local industry. Their reasoning is that these timbers are primarily used as raw materials for locally made incense. There is no domestic production of these timbers, which not only contributes to industry but also benefits agriculture. Furthermore, these fragrant woods are already subject to customs duties upon import, with taxes ranging from four cents per hundred catties to twenty-five percent of the value, creating a heavy burden. The merchants fear that with the addition of a special tax, many stores will struggle to survive. After reviewing the petition, the Finance Department deemed the claims to be factual. It has exempted *Dalbergia tonkinensis* and *Caesalpinia sappan* from the special tax, but they will still be subject to the dye tax. It has been observed that Guangdong Province has a large market for imported timber, and there are significant stocks of old inventory. The Finance Department originally set the deadline for inventory registration as the 14th. However, due to requests from merchants who felt the registration period was too short, the special tax bureau has extended the deadline for inventory registration to the 20th of this month (June 19th).</p>

However, the cargo handlers refused to unload it, leaving the stolen coal still loaded on thirteen boats and unable to be unloaded ashore. The boatmen faced starvation, leading to several disputes. On the 22nd, Wang Junshi and Zhu Songtao, Chinese staff members from Mitsui &amp; Co. in Cheng, came to Wuxi and hired more than ten cargo handlers to secretly unload the coal at night, intending to unload the stolen coal into Zhang Wanyuan's liquor store. However, cargo handlers each have their own territory. The unloading operation was discovered by other cargo handlers, who gathered to protest. Wang Junshi refused to stop unloading, and the two sides were taken to the Second Police Precinct. Officers ordered them to resolve the dispute outside the station. However, after leaving the station, the coal owner instructed the boatmen and workers to continue unloading. By around 10:00 PM, only a few dozen tons of the stolen coal (approximately one boatload) had been unloaded. The boat owner then sought settlement for the boat and meal expenses from Jing Heling (an ophthalmologist), the representative of the coal owner, who refused to pay a single cent. Upon hearing this, the other boatmen automatically stopped unloading midway. At the same time, Zhang Deqi, the owner of Zhang Wanyuan's liquor store, upon learning the inside story of the stolen coal, also published a statement declaring that he would not allow the storage of stolen coal. The storage of the stolen coal was a result of the coal owner's coercion. Therefore, the coal incident is still difficult to resolve for the time being.</p>

<p>Since the 19th fiscal year to the 23rd fiscal year, the expenses of the various schools in this county have suffered from financial constraints. The Education Bureau has been unable to release funds on a monthly basis, resulting in accumulated debts of more than ten installments over the past four years. Subsequently, after the implementation of the treasury system in the 23rd fiscal year, these expenses were listed under accumulated debt. Some deceased and retired teachers were paid a small amount. As there is no clear timeframe for repayment, and as this year's new and old grain tax collection is at its peak, and educational funds are also relatively abundant, more than ten principals from Taqian, Xueqian, Yangang, and other schools have jointly petitioned the bureau, requesting that the accumulated debt be allocated in regular installments in accordance with the prescribed standard to provide some compensation.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Merchants Successfully Navigate the Dragon Boat Festival <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the Dragon Boat Festival, which is traditionally the first major settlement period of the year for businesses. It is reported that the merchants have had good success in collecting payments, with an average collection rate of 70-80%. They have successfully navigated the Dragon Boat Festival. The reasons for this success are that merchants have been more cautious about extending credit in recent years, ensuring that accounts are reliable and stable, and the collection rate is better. Furthermore, banks have been more active in lending this year, helping businesses with their financial turnover, and operations in various sectors have shown some improvement. As a result, industries such as silk fabrics, foreign goods, and mountain products have seen profits.</p>

<p>Du Shuyi, a painter, brought his family to Zhenjiang in early this month and stayed at Room 28 of the Yangzi Hotel on Yingjiang Road, planning to exhibit his works. Yesterday (the 23rd), at around 2:00 PM, Du and his wife were chatting in their room when they suddenly saw their five-year-old daughter, Lu Zi, crying as she came in from outside, holding her lower body. They examined her and found bloodstains on her undergarments. Suspecting something was wrong, they gathered all the servants and asked the girl to identify the perpetrator. The girl pointed to Chen Changhua as the culprit. They immediately called the police, who arrested Chen and took him to the local police station, which then transferred him to the court. After the prosecutor opened the court for questioning, Du Shuyi recounted the above incident and presented the bloodstained pants as evidence. The defendant, Chen Changhua, vehemently denied the accusation. An examination was then conducted, and the forensic doctor determined that the girl's hymen had been ruptured. However, due to incomplete surgical instruments, it was difficult to determine whether the injury was caused by trauma or by the genitals. As a result, the plaintiff was instructed to return home, and the defendant was detained. A re-examination was scheduled for 10:00 AM on the 23rd.</p>

<p>At Jiangjia Bridge in Longchuan Town, Fourth District, the Dongya Company, which is contracted to build a moveable bridge on the Yangjing Highway, had about thirty bridge workers suddenly rush to the home of Zhang Peng, a prostitute in Xiaotiaokou, Xiannv Town, armed with iron tools, and began smashing things. They then went to knock on the door of Han Jicun's clothing store in Guoqiaolou Lane. When Jicun's sixteen-year-old sister, Xiuying, opened the door, the workers kicked her violently in the lower body, causing serious injury. She immediately collapsed to the ground. Someone reported the incident to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau, which ordered police officers to arrest fifteen people. After preliminary interrogation at the bureau, the workers claimed that they had been bullied by Han Jicun at Zhang Peng's home, and they had decided to seek revenge. After questioning, the bureau sent them to the Public Security Bureau for disposition. However, Jicun's sister was seriously injured, and her life may be in danger.</p>

He specifically telegraphed the engineering director Feng Qie, the first section chief Tang Yuangan, and the second section chief Wu Lin, instructing them to complete the work before the flood season and to avoid any delays that could compromise flood prevention. Furthermore, reconstruction of breached areas along the Central Canal, including Mao'erwo in Pixian County, have not been fully completed. This area is located downstream of Xutang, with water flowing from the Unstable River and the main stream of the Central Canal, making it impossible to ignore.

<p>Zheng Caifang, a resident of Caotou Xianggongfang in the 7th District of Zhenhai, is a pastry maker. His wife, Liu, has two sons and a daughter: Shenyao, 6 years old; Shenxiang, 2 years old; and Shen'e, 4 years old. Zheng Caifang's Xinshinan goods store, which he opened in Chaiqiao, failed two years ago. Last year, he went to Shanghai to do business on the recommendation of friends and relatives, but again lost his job and returned home. His younger brother, Jifang, a craftsman, believed that with a family of five bringing in no income, it was not beneficial to him. Therefore, on the 5th day of last month, he gathered relatives and friends to separate the households. A few days ago, in order to pay the association fee of eight jiao in silver, he pledged the tin table and the association certificate. As a result, Zheng Caifang and Liu became increasingly negative and often contemplated suicide. On the evening of the 20th, the family had no food for the next day and had only watery rice for dinner. Zheng Caifang, seeing this, went out with tears in his eyes to watch a show at the Chaishimiao temple. Liu, fearing that something might happen, asked her father-in-law to find him. Her father-in-law refused. Liu felt that her situation was precarious and the future with her husband was bleak, so she resolved to commit suicide. At around 8:00 PM that evening, she tied her two sons and one daughter together, carried them to the Zhengjia shore of the Houcao stream, and jumped into the water. They all drowned. When Zheng Caifang returned home and saw the door wide open and no one answered his calls, he rushed to the riverbank and saw his wife and four children floating lifeless in the water. He cried out for help, and when they were pulled ashore, it was too late to save them. Zheng Caifang, in his grief, also wanted to throw himself into the water, but he was prevented from doing so by several of his cousins, who took care of him. The incident was reported to the township office, and coffins were prepared for the burial. Those who heard of it were filled with sorrow.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Sir Leith-Ross Departs Shanghai Yesterday; Sung Tzu-wen, British Chargé d'Affaires, and Others Give Warm Farewell; Hall-Patch and Rogers Appointed to Continue Staying in China <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British Commissioner specially sent to China to investigate economic conditions and the chief advisor to the British Treasury, along with his wife and female secretary, Miss Crakner, departed Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM aboard the British Company's *Rawalpindi*. Sung Tzu-wen, standing committee member of the National Economic Council and chairman of the Bank of China, personally accompanied his wife, along with the British Chargé d'Affaires to China, Mr. Howe, and his wife, who came specially from Tianjin to give a warm farewell. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Departure from Shanghai Amidst Firecrackers</p>
<p>The ship was docked at the Eleventh and Twelfth buoys on the river. On the Chinese side, the Jianghai Customs' *Jinghui* small steamer was specially prepared for Sir Leith-Ross to board, along with a large number of firecrackers to celebrate his departure. At 2:10 PM, he departed from the Cathay Hotel to the new Customs wharf. After shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries with the farewell party, he boarded the ship amidst the sound of firecrackers. Mr. and Mrs. Sung accompanied him directly to the *Rawalpindi* before returning. The ship then weighed anchor and departed Shanghai at 4:00 PM sharp.</p>
<p>Warm Farewell from Various Chinese and British Representatives</p>
<p>Those who went to the ship to bid farewell included, in addition to Mr. and Mrs. Sung and the British Chargé d'Affaires and his wife, Mr. Chen Xing, Vice President of the Central Bank, representing Mr. Kong Hsiang-hsi, the Deputy Premier of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance; Secretary Chen Bingzhang; Mr. Zheng Lai, Director of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance; Mr. Younge, British Advisor to the Ministry of Finance; Sir Brenan, the British Consul General in Shanghai; Mr. Bell, Commercial Counselor; Mr. George, Air Attaché; Mr. Barkham, Chinese Language Counselor of the British Embassy; Secretary Grahame; British Consul Mr. Lamb; and over thirty individuals from the Chinese banking community, including Sung Han-chang, Hsu Hsin-liu, Li Fu-sun, Hu Pi-chiang, Sung Tzu-liang, Pei Sung-sun, Hsi Teh-mou, Sung Tzu-an, etc. Minister Kong, Mr. and Mrs. Sung, and the British Consul General and his wife also presented many flower baskets to Mr. and Mrs. Leith-Ross to wish them a good journey.</p>
<p>Two Assistants Continue to Stay in China</p>
<p>Mr. E. Hall-Patch and Mr. C. Rogers, the assistants to Leith-Ross, only went to the ship to bid farewell and did not travel with him. Hall-Patch has been appointed as the financial advisor to the British embassies in both China and Japan. Rogers has been appointed to remain in China to continue unfinished work. Hall-Patch was originally a senior official in the British Treasury, and Rogers is a senior officer at a London bank.</p>
<p>Expected to Arrive in England in Late Next Month</p>
<p>Sir Leith-Ross is returning directly to London to report on his mission. He will not be staying in any cities along the way. According to the ship's itinerary, he is expected to arrive in England in late next month. His written report has already been sent to England in advance. Sir Leith-Ross arrived in Shanghai on September 21 of last year, making his stay a total of nine months and two days.</p>
<p>Reporters from *L'Impartial* interviewed responsible members of the financial community yesterday morning. They expressed the following opinions regarding Leith-Ross's statements: Leith-Ross's statements can be roughly divided into four parts. The first part describes the silver crisis that China has encountered since 1934 and the measures taken by the Chinese financial authorities to deal with this crisis and their effectiveness. The second part states that although China has tried its best to avoid the silver crisis, its economic situation has not yet reached its best due to the lack of a solid financial system, the unrest in inland security, and the unresolved special problems of North China. The third part calls for a reduction in tariffs. The fourth part mentions that British investment in China has extremely profound opinions, in other words, expresses real guarantees. It only needs to read his speech about the fact that Britain has expressed a lot of sympathy for China, but in this gift in the state of deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations, this problem cannot be denied. Therefore, if we want to achieve the stability and progress of China's economy, we must first adjust the international situation. The United Kingdom, the United States and other countries have invested heavily in China and have a deep relationship with the economy of the Far East. I sincerely hope that they can take the position of morality and justice to create a stable international relationship, so that China can realize its economic construction and the national economy can gradually become prosperous. At that time, it will be more difficult to develop import and export trade than to reduce tax rates. Sir Leith-Ross’s conclusion is nothing more than wanting China to import some key goods. If we speak with an open and fair attitude, China is very willing to become a large market for various countries, but the reason for the degradation of international quality trade for many years lies in the aggression of improper political and military forces from abroad and the improper disasters outside the country and rural areas. Bankruptcy, if the United Kingdom and the United States can develop China's heavy industry and agriculture with a large amount of capital from a friendly standpoint, the vast majority of Chinese laborers can increase their purchasing power, which is actually beneficial to all countries. In short, under the current situation in China, its economic aspect has a relationship with Britain and the United States. China's prosperity and decline will affect Europe and the United States, so I sincerely hope that all countries will provide effective assistance to China, so that the development of China's economy will also help its domestic trade increase and move towards a situation of co-existence and co-prosperity.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the forty-second birthday of the British Emperor Edward VIII. The British troops stationed in Shanghai held a parade at the racecourse. The sound of gunfire and drums intertwined, attracting a large number of Chinese and foreign officials and civilians. It was the first celebration for the British community since the British Emperor ascended the throne. The Chinese, because they happened to coincide with the Dragon Boat Festival, were exceptionally excited. The parade began at noon, with Sir Brenan, the British Consul General, representing the British Emperor standing on the reviewing stand to receive the troops' salute. Then, several volleys of gunfire were fired, and the British national anthem was played, followed by three cheers for the British Emperor. The entire team then saluted again. When Sir Brenan left the venue, the audience also saluted as required. The British Consulate General's Office, the British Court, and British businesses were all closed yesterday. However, due to the recent death of the former emperor, the consulate did not hold a celebration reception as in previous years.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Ministry of Finance Announces the Establishment of Five Provincial Tax Bureaus; The Original Agencies Will Be Merged and Reorganized Separately; Jing Yan and Others Will Be Directors of the Three District Bureaus <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>According to Shenshi News Agency, in order to adjust the tax organization in the five provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, Henan and Sichuan, the Ministry of Finance submitted to the central government for approval to establish the Hubei-Henan, Hunan-Jiangxi, and Sichuan Three District Tax Bureaus. The official announcement was made yesterday by ministerial order. The original text stated, "The various unified taxes, tobacco and alcohol taxes, and mineral product taxes under the jurisdiction of the Tax Department of the Ministry have always been set up as separate agencies to collect taxes separately. The organization is very fragmented, and the command is not unified, which makes inspection difficult and easily breeds malpractices. After repeated and thorough rectification, although some effects have been achieved, there is still a lack of significant results. The crux of the problem lies in this. Unless a fundamental reform is carried out, it will be difficult to achieve a thorough reorganization. In view of this, the Ministry has drafted an outline for unifying the tax agencies in various provinces and reforming the tobacco and alcohol tax methods, which was submitted to the 262nd meeting of the Executive Yuan for deliberation and approval. It should be implemented in accordance with the order. The Ministry has now decided to implement it in the five provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Henan, and Sichuan, starting from the 25th year, and has designated Hunan and Jiangxi as one district, Hubei and Henan as one district, and Sichuan as two districts. In addition to the original Henan Province under the jurisdiction of the Luyu District General Tax Bureau, which has now been transferred to the jurisdiction of Hubei and Henan, the Unified Tax Bureau should be changed to the East District General Tax Bureau. The various unified taxes, tobacco and alcohol taxes agencies within the five provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, Henan, and Sichuan under the jurisdiction of each district shall be separately reduced, merged, and reorganized. Each district shall establish a district tax bureau to specifically supervise the collection of matters, and consider the situation and delineate areas in the five provinces to establish sub-district tax management offices and tax sub-offices to specialize in tax collection affairs. In addition to the temporary regulations separately formulated by the Ministry for promulgation and implementation, and reported to the Executive Yuan for special filing and separate announcements, it is hereby announced. This order."</p>
<p>It is also learned that the candidates for the directors of the three district tax bureaus have also been announced by the Ministry of Finance by ministerial order. Jing Youyan will act as the director of the Hubei-Henan District Tax Bureau, Ding Chungao will act as the director of the Hunan-Jiangxi District Tax Bureau, Zai Zongzhu will act as the director of the Sichuan District Tax Bureau, and Qu Dacheng and other twenty-one people will be the directors of the twenty-one sub-district tax management offices such as Hankou.</p>
<h3 id="e96">German Goods Imported to Shanghai Increased Sharply in May, Thirteen Times More Than the Same Period Last Year <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>According to Shenshi News Agency, Germany's trade with China has always been dominated by heavy industry. In recent years, German goods imported to China have suddenly increased. In mid-April this year, German goods imported to Shanghai accounted for the first place in Shanghai's imports. The total amount imported in May was 12,737,716 yuan, a sharp decrease of 2,515,887 yuan compared to the 10,221,829 yuan in April, an increase of 25%. Compared with the statistics of German goods imported in May last year, which was 5,424,658 yuan, it has soared by 135%. The rate of increase is really amazing. Some commentators believe that this is due to the difference in the conversion of customs gold units into silver dollars. In May last year, the average was 1 customs gold unit equals 1.63 yuan of national currency, while this year the average customs gold unit has risen to 2.262 yuan. Therefore, the reporter specially inquired from the customs to obtain the figures in gold unit for publication as follows: May was 5,653,669 customs gold units, and April was 4,518,934 customs gold units, an increase of 25%. Compared with the 3,319,864 customs gold units in May last year, the increase of 2,338,05 customs gold is still a sharp increase of more than 70%. Among the German goods imported to Shanghai in May, the highest increase rate was wheat. The import in April was only 2,407 customs gold units, and in May it was 411,677 customs gold units, a sharp increase of more than 40 customs gold. Other items such as metals and ores have also increased significantly, and the proportion of machinery, tools, and dyes has also increased by more than one time, setting a new record in recent years.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Overseas Chinese Urgently Hope That the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Will Open a China-Malaysia Shipping Route <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the International Trade Bureau reported the recent situation of the China-Malaysia shipping route by the Consulate in Penang, saying that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company recently borrowed money from the Boxer Indemnity Committee and Shanghai banking circles to build new ships to run between China and Malaysia. The China-Malaysia shipping route has always been manipulated by foreign ships, and Chinese ships have occupied a very small position, which is even worse in recent years. In the past, Qiu Changbo, a former wealthy man in this island, built many large ships such as Zhangzhou, Fujian, and Haicheng, which sailed to Penang, Singapore, Hong Kong, Shantou, and Xiamen, etc. This was the beginning of Chinese merchants opening up the China-Malaysia shipping route. Later, there were Lin Zhenzong, a giant merchant in Yangon, and Lin Heban, a giant merchant in Singapore. Lin Zhenzong had many large ships such as Shuangchun, Shuang'an, and Shuangguo, each with a load of 7,000 to 8,000 tons or 10,000 tons. Hufeng Company had Fengqing, Fengping, and Fengsheng, which has been discontinued, Fenghua, Fengmao, Fengyuan, which sank in Shantou port, and Fengxiang, which is now sailing, and many other ships, all with a load of 4,000 to 5,000 tons or 6,000 to 7,000 tons, all running between China, Malaysia, and Yangon. However, times have changed, and the situation is different from the past. Qiu Changbo, the founder of the China-Malaysia shipping route opened up by Chinese merchants, after his death, the large ships he operated, such as Fujian, Zhangzhou, and Haicheng, are no longer seen. Lin Zhenzong, who continued to open up the China-South shipping route, and his large ships such as Shuangmei, Shuang'an, and Shuangguo, have also been sold to foreigners for operation due to the environment. Now, the only Chinese ship left is Hufeng. Hufeng was originally entirely Chinese capital. In 1932, it cooperated with the British company Delee Steamship Company and changed to a limited company, thus becoming a Sino-British joint venture. The Chinese ships sailing between China and Malaysia have gone from prosperity to decline. As a result, foreign ships are rampant and almost entirely occupied by foreign ships. Suddenly, our China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has a proposal to open the China-Malaysia shipping route. Overseas Chinese are all overjoyed. If this proposal can be realized, it can slightly recover the rights and interests and make up for the loopholes.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the Cotton Adulteration and Mixing Prohibition Office of the Cotton Control Association of the National Economic Committee in July last year, the work has been promoted and achieved remarkable results. The Japanese Spinning Industry Association in China recently sent a letter to Chen Guangfu, a member of the Control Association, praising the improvement of the quality of Chinese cotton. The original letter stated, "(Omitted above) Regarding the work of prohibiting water and adulteration of Chinese cotton and its effects, this association has conducted an investigation, and now compiles statistical tables of the investigation results and sends them to your association for review and reference. Since the establishment of the Prohibition Office in July last year under the planning of your association, it has been in operation for one year and has achieved remarkable results in handling the prohibition work. The percentage of moisture and impurities in Chinese cotton has been reduced. According to the investigation of the nine members in Shanghai, the impurities in 1933-1934 decreased from 1.5% to 1.0%, and the moisture decreased from 13% to 12%. If we can continue to work hard to prohibit the behavior of adding water and impurities to cotton, it will soon be eliminated, and we are deeply fortunate for the future of Chinese cotton."</p>

<h3 id="e102">The Ant Troupe's Third Performance Was Banned Again Yesterday Morning; The Three Plays Were All Approved by the Education Bureau; More Than a Thousand Spectators Were Frustrated and Helpless <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>According to Huadong News Agency, following the Experimental Troupe of Xingqi, the third performance of the Ant Troupe, which was scheduled to be held at the Hushe Theater on Beijing Road yesterday morning, was banned by the Public Works Department again. The purpose of this performance by the troupe is to: 1. Contact troupe members for Dragon Boat Festival entertainment; 2. Sell tickets to provide for troupe expenses. The three plays performed, "Smuggling," "Poison," and "Bugle," were all approved by the Education Bureau. This sudden ban has caused more than a thousand spectators to be frustrated and helpless, as they were not aware of the details beforehand and most went to the meeting before 9:00 to watch. Several hundred spectators even burst into tears because of this.</p>
<p>Repeatedly Changed the Repertoire The troupe is affiliated with the Ant Society and aims to connect troupe members' feelings. All previous performances were free tickets and invitations to troupe members, relatives, and friends. The first time there were more than 200 spectators, and the second time there were more than 600 spectators. This time was the third performance. In order to raise troupe expenses, tickets were sold at a price of 50 cents by the Commercial Press. More than a thousand tickets have been sold so far. The original program was "Smuggling," "Bugle," and "Who Killed the Baby," all of which were approved by the Municipal Education Bureau. Later, because the play "Who Killed the Baby" was inconvenient for today's Children's Year, the play "Poison" was temporarily changed.</p>
<p>Finally Banned by the Concession The troupe went through several preparations and changed the program several times, and finally decided to perform at the Hushe Theater yesterday morning. The morning was to entertain troupe members, but suddenly there was an obstacle and it was finally stopped. The reason was the ban by the Public Works Department. The announcement is recorded as follows: "Our troupe was originally scheduled to hold the third performance today, performing the three plays "Smuggling," "Poison," and "Bugle." We suddenly received a notice from the Hushe Theater that the Public Works Department ordered the venue to be stopped and must be rescheduled. The date and location will be announced again. The matter is in a hurry. Thank you for your journey. Please be aware of it."</p>
<h3 id="e103">Yu Yaoqiu, Executive Committee Member of the Taxpayers' Association, Sent a Letter Requesting a Protest Against the Forced Suspension of Patriotic Plays; The Plot is a Symbolic Representation of the Facts to Arouse Public Sentiment; There is Absolutely No Reason for the Public Works Department to Force the Suspension of the Performance <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, Yu Yaoqiu, Executive Committee Member of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession, sent a special letter to the Association yesterday, requesting that the Public Works Department be severely involved in forcing the Experimental and Ant Troupe to stop performing patriotic dramas. The original letter said: "Gentlemen, after reading the newspaper, I learned that the Experimental and Ant Troupe successively performed dramas such as "Smuggling," "Qiuyang," "A Corner of the City," "Poison," and "Bugle" at the Xingguang Grand Theater and the Hushe Theater. The internal situation is nothing more than symbolizing the seriousness of smuggling in North China and the reality of the puppet state in order to arouse the attention of the Chinese people and the justice of friendly countries in the international community. In the rhythm of the whole play, there is absolutely no action that violates the law or hinders public order. Now the Public Works Department has forced the suspension of the performance. The intention is really confusing. Moreover, smuggling directly damages China's tax revenue and indirectly affects the trade between countries and China. Secondly, the issue of the puppet state is not only not recognized by China, but also not recognized by countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and members of the League of Nations. From this, it can be seen that the justice of friendly countries is still there and their sympathy for us cannot be denied. The concession authorities are the administrative organs of the countries concerned stationed in Shanghai. They are not allowed to rebel against the will of their own countries and act arbitrarily. The Experimental and Ant Troupe use the current facts to write and perform plays, which is a performance of the people's spirit of protecting their own country, and the purpose is to arouse the emotions of the entire nation to prepare for saving the country. The concession is a residence for foreigners, not a colony of foreigners or the second puppet Manchuria. Friendly countries that sympathize with us should be encouraged. How can we allow unreasonable destruction and forced suspension of performances? Therefore, I hereby request your association to make serious representations to the Public Works Department as soon as possible. Patriotic dramas of this kind must not be unreasonably suppressed. Tears are falling while writing, and I can't help but feel sad and indignant."</p>

<p>Vancouver is the largest city on the Pacific coast of British Columbia. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the opening of the port. The municipal government of the city specially scheduled to hold a grand celebration from July 1st to September 7th. Local overseas Chinese groups were invited to participate. In order to promote national glory and promote culture, they took the opportunity to build houses in the central area of the city during this period to hold a Chinese Culture and Art Exhibition, and collected exhibits from the country. After hearing the news, Dr. Jiang Kanghu believed that taking this opportunity would not only be enough to promote the national culture, but also the only good opportunity to promote the export of domestic products. Therefore, he took the responsibility to solicit from various places to witness its success. A reporter from the Xinxin News Agency specially went to the office on Beijing Road yesterday to interview Jiang to inquire about the situation. According to him, the Vancouver Chinese Culture and Art Exhibition was originally scheduled to open on July 1st. Since April this year, a notice was issued to collect exhibits. However, I heard the news later, so I only solicited from friends in Ping, Tianjin, Qing, Ji, Su, and Beijing. Other more distant areas were not collected due to time constraints. Up to now, this office has received more than 2,500 exhibits, which are summarized into three major categories: 1. Culture and art categories, including calligraphy and painting, books, oracle bones, coins, sculptures, statues, jade articles, stone articles, ivory articles, bronze articles, iron articles, porcelain articles, lacquerware, and ancient and modern stationery, religious instruments, educational supplies, scenic spots, and historical relics; 2. Industrial categories, including silk weaving, embroidery, bamboo ware, rattan ware, daily decorations, etc.; 3. Agricultural categories, including raw silk, tung oil, medicinal materials, tea, etc. The above items have been scheduled to be shipped out of the country by the Japanese Empress on the 27th of this month in order to rush to display them and promote national glory.</p>

<p>The United Association of Citizens of the First Special District of this city believes that smuggling is rampant. If no measures are taken to prevent it, it will have a huge impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. Therefore, the third executive meeting decided to convene a general assembly of representatives from all walks of life in agriculture, industry, commerce, and students in this city on the 24th of this month to discuss concrete methods to automatically prevent smuggling and save the sales of domestic goods, so that we can pool our efforts to make it impossible for vagrant rascals and traitors to operate, so as to achieve the goal of purification. Yesterday, special letters were sent to various groups, saying: "Gentlemen, in recent years, vagrant rascals and traitors, relying on special forces, have been evading taxes and smuggling more and more rampantly, destroying our country's tax revenue and endangering various industries. This is the most serious. The commercial situation in this city is complicated and controls the main traffic routes by water and land. If effective prevention measures are not planned, smuggling will inevitably become more serious. The impact will be that the depressed market will be on the verge of total annihilation. Therefore, it has been decided to convene a general assembly of representatives from various groups at the City Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 p.m. on the 24th of this month to discuss countermeasures. This matter is related to maintaining social economy and the lifeline of the country. I hope that your association will send two representatives to attend the meeting on time and discuss the progress together."</p>

<p>The Guangdong Fellow Association in Shanghai, in order to appeal for peace, requested the Guangdong and Guangxi armies to withdraw to their original defenses. Yesterday, they specially telegraphed to the authorities in Guangdong and Guangxi, saying: "Mr. Chen Bonan, Mr. Li Delin, and Mr. Lin Yunhai in Guangzhou, transfer to Mr. Bai Jiansheng in Nanning, Jianjian. I heard about the withdrawal of troops before, and I am very comforted. Now I hear that one side is changing its course and moving forward, and at the same time actively preparing for military operations. People's hearts are becoming more and more panicked and unpredictable. I still hope that we will adhere to the same purpose of saving the country and quickly withdraw the Guangdong and Guangxi armies to within the borders of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces to show good faith. Otherwise, driving the people of Guangdong and Guangxi to be enemies with their neighbors and destroying peaceful unification, then saving the country will be enough to harm the country. The gentlemen's title of resisting foreign insults is willing to follow the footsteps of the four towns at the end of the Ming Dynasty. Not only will they be unable to face the people of the country, but they will not be able to be understood by their hometown. Our association is eager to love our hometown, and I can't help but say too much. I hope you will consider it." The Guangdong Fellow Association in Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Workers' Unions, recently reported that the Guangdong and Guangxi armies have directly entered Hunan and Jiangxi, and are adjacent to Fujian, which will cause internal strife. Yesterday, they sent another telegram to Chen, Li, Bai and others, as follows: "Mr. Chen Bonan, Mr. Li Delin in Guangzhou, Mr. Bai Jiansheng in Nanning, Jianjian, the true telegram has been received. The national crisis is imminent, saving the country and resisting foreign insults are in everyone's heart. However, this matter is of great importance and must be consistent from top to bottom, with everyone working together and planning in a unified way by the central government. Judging the situation and working together in harmony can achieve success. The previous dispatch of troops from Guangdong and Guangxi to the north caused panic among the people, and telegrams were sent to request a withdrawal. It is not that we have different opinions on the proposal. We deeply appreciate that the steps are chaotic first, and saving the country is just inviting the destruction of the country. However, recently I read the news that the Guangdong and Guangxi armies have directly entered Hunan and Jiangxi, and are adjacent to Fujian. The name is resisting Japan, but it is equivalent to internal strife. If we do not stop it, the consequences will be unimaginable. The public opinion of the people and the people's hearing is free. If they arbitrarily use troops and destroy unity, not only will they make the enemy happy, but they will also make our Chinese nation fall into an irreparable situation. This is directly cutting off from the masses and becoming a sinner for future generations. Now the second plenary session of the Central Committee is scheduled to be convened, and all major plans will be decided from then on. We urge you to rein in at the precipice, listen to the advice of the government and the people of the whole country, and return to your posts immediately to comfort the people's hopes. Urgent words, I pray that you will consider and accept them." The Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Workers' Unions respectfully.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Iron Ministry Responds to Banking Association: Freight Receipts Not Allowed for Discounting; Three Restrictions on Longhai Consignment Notes; Planned Implementation in Stages <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association previously sent a letter to the Ministry of Railways requesting that freight receipts be made negotiable, treated as consignment notes, and inquiring about the three restrictions on consignment notes issued by the Longhai Railway. The Ministry of Railways has now responded to the Banking Association, explaining why freight receipts cannot be approved for discounting to prevent abuses. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Longhai Railway's Report: The Longhai Railway Engineering and Transportation Departments jointly submitted a report to the Ministry of Railways stating that due to incomplete facilities at various stations along the line, consignment notes are initially only issued at eight stations, including Dapu, which have warehouses. Other stations lack warehouses and cargo sheds, making it extremely difficult to safeguard goods and preventing simultaneous implementation. However, to promote broader adoption, warehouses are being selectively constructed. This year, Weinan, Xi'an, and Lianyungang stations have been added to the list of stations issuing consignment notes. Currently, the first phase of construction is planned for warehouses at twelve stations: Huangkou, Dangshan, Mamuji, Liuhe, Minquan, Lanfeng, Kaifeng, Zhongmu, Sishui, Luodong, Shanzhou, and Lingbao. The second phase will include twenty-two stations: A’huzhen, Xin’anzhen, Wayao, PaoChe, Yunhe, BaChaji, Xuzhou, Lizhuang, Yangji, Heishiguan, Yanshi County, Zhangjingpu, Shengchi, Guanyintang, Changjiawan, Pantouzhen, Wendizhen, Qilicun, Huazhou, Chishui, Lingkou, and Xinfengzhen. The remaining stations are planned for the third phase. Consignment notes will be issued as soon as the warehouses are completed. Regarding waterway-railway combined transport consignment notes, agreement has been reached with the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Regarding the printing format, a sample has been drafted based on the Ministry's regulations and sent to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for approval. Follow-up reminders have been sent, and a fixed date for implementation will be set upon receiving their response. Ministry regulations stipulate that consignment notes are only issued at the request of the shipper, and the request must be noted in the special instructions column of the shipping order. To ensure that shippers understand and utilize this system, widespread publicity will be conducted.</p>
<p>Ministry of Railways' Reply: After receiving the report, the Ministry of Railways responded to the Banking Association, stating that "Your Association's official letter of May 12th is acknowledged. The regulations for the use of consignment notes and freight receipts are different. Consignment notes can be freely discounted and transferred with strict procedures. Freight receipts do not have such procedures, and it is not appropriate to allow them to be discounted to prevent abuses. Regarding the three restrictions on the issuance of consignment notes by the Longhai Railway, as reported by the railway, a phased implementation plan is in progress. We have sent the original report for your reference."</p>

<h3 id="e111">Details of Commodity Inspection Bureau's Silk Industry Representatives Meeting <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry convened a meeting of silk industry representatives from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and Shandong at the International Trade Bureau conference room on the afternoon of the 22nd. Attendees included Tan Xihong, Cai Wuji, Xia Daoxiang, Miao Zhongxiu, He Shangping, Dr. Mary, and silk industry representatives such as Zhu Jing'an, Shen Huachen, Huang Jiwen, Xu Ligeng, Xu Shouyi, Xue Zukang, Huang Bingruo, Zheng Haiquan, Hu Zhongming, Zhang Xinyuan, Hu Weigai, and Zhang Zhuping, Yin Buting, and more than twenty others. Chairman Cai Wuji began by reporting the purpose of the meeting, stating that the bureau had been ordered by the Ministry in March to prepare for raw silk quality inspection. Progress over the past few months had been smooth, but the matter was significant and related to the future of China's silk industry. Therefore, representatives were invited to the bureau to discuss the matter jointly, gather opinions, and learn from each other. Then, Miao Zhongxiu reported on the progress of the preparations, stating that the Japanese government had implemented mandatory raw silk quality inspection long ago. To learn from neighboring countries' implementation methods, he was sent to Japan to study raw silk inspection policies. After returning, he ordered various new-style inspection machines and instruments from home and abroad, recruited and trained technical personnel, and expanded the original location to actively prepare for the inspection. A preliminary raw silk grade table was drafted and distributed to silk merchants for reference. The original plan was to start implementation on July 1st, but because the installation of machinery takes a long time, it is proposed to submit to the Ministry to change the official implementation date to August 1st. Afterwards, Director Tan Xihong gave his opinion on raw silk inspection, stating that the methods and standards of raw silk quality inspection must be discussed by silk merchants to ensure that both buyers and sellers benefit. Now that industries are trending towards standardization and science, raw silk inspection has reached the point of standard implementation, but the power rests with the buyer, and disputes are inevitable. To prepare proper methods, the government will preside over the inspection, ensuring fair inspection between buyers and producers. The establishment of grades should be based on existing precedents of production, consumption, and competition, with the hope of preparing for grade inspection within one year. Silk industry representatives Zhu Jing'an and Shen Huachen expressed their support for the government's raw silk inspection policy and hoped for cooperation between the government and businesses. Finally, it was decided to implement raw silk quality inspection on August 1st of this year, and to implement raw silk grade inspection after the new silk appears next year. During this one-year preparation period, proper methods should be researched to ensure timely implementation. This decision will be submitted to the Ministry of Industry for approval before implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Zhejiang General Chamber of Commerce Requests Suspension of Special Construction Tax <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Letter Sent to Zhejiang Donation and Tax Supervision Committee: Stop Extension Upon Expiration</p>
<p>The Zhejiang General Chamber of Commerce, located at Lianzhu Lane, Avenue Edward VII, sent a letter to the Zhejiang Provincial Donation and Tax Supervision Committee yesterday, stating that the burden of taxes in Zhejiang is heaviest in western Zhejiang, and the largest additional tax on land is the special construction tax. The total amount of silver and rice exceeds one-half of the regular tax.</p>
<p>Zhejiang has suffered frequent disasters in recent years. The people's strength has been depleted, and the burden of taxes has become heavier, leading to more arrears. Officials and the people are in dire straits. The Chamber has repeatedly called for relief, and the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly ordered reductions, but the special tax has been designated for debt service and has not been reduced. The so-called debt service fund refers to the 18th year of the Republic construction bonds, which expired in the 28th year of the Republic. The people are already struggling to bear the burden. The newly revised Zhejiang Provincial Public Bond Regulations include the special tax in the principal and interest repayment items. The repayment period is divided into four types: fourteen years, sixteen years, eighteen years, and twenty years, extending the term of the original debt service fund by more than ten years. With repeated extensions, this harsh tax will never be abolished, and the people's difficulties will never be alleviated. Fortunately, Article 6 of the regulations states that if there are changes in the income designated for the fund before the public bonds are cleared, the Zhejiang Provincial Government shall request the approval of the Executive Yuan to designate other income, such as land tax, deed tax, and brokerage business tax, to fully supplement the amount. This can be used as a remedy after the fact. The Chamber respectfully asks the committee to have sympathy for the people's difficulties and to promptly send a letter to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to follow the original plan and stop the special construction tax when it expires in the 28th year of the Republic, without continuing it. Other funds should be designated to supplement the amount and announce this clearly to dispel public doubts. Although the Chamber understands the current difficult times and the provincial treasury's financial difficulties, it dares not insist on its previous view of a complete and immediate abolition. However, it requests that the tax be stopped on schedule in accordance with the previous plan, which will surely be appreciated. Furthermore, the provincial deed tax, brokerage business tax, etc., were previously listed as security for bonds but are not included in the new regulations' principal and interest repayment fund items. This is stated jointly. This is addressed to the Zhejiang Provincial Donation and Tax Supervision Committee, from the Zhejiang General Chamber of Commerce.</p>

The total includes 66 works by Gao Jianfu, 3 works by Ms. Song Minghuang (Gao's wife), 3 works by Ms. Gao Lihua, and 100 works by Gao Jianfu's students, such as "Internal Conflict," "Battle of Shanghai," "After Plowing," and "Strengthen Our Air Defense," and the "Guangzhou Sun Yat-sen Memorial" are all masterpieces of their time.</p>
<p>Mayor's Report: At the preview yesterday afternoon, Mayor Wu introduced Gao Jianfu to the guests and gave an introductory speech, saying, "Mr. Gao Jianfu is a renowned Chinese painter. Gao's success lies in his perseverance and dedication to art, day after day for decades. He also went to Japan and India, adopting styles from various countries to complement his work, integrating them and forming his own style, truly worthy of being called a grand master of new Chinese painting. In recent years, he has also founded the Chunshui Painting Academy in Guangdong, which is also highly reputable. Today, the public exhibition of Gao's masterpieces and the works of his students is a great event for the art world."</p>
<p>Gao's Eloquent Discussion: Gao then spoke eloquently about Chinese painting, saying, "Today, I am honored that President Sun, President Cai, Mayor Wu, and the Chinese Women's Association, T'ien Hsia Society, Cosmic Wind Society, Yi Jing Society, China Review Society, and various cultural organizations are sponsoring this exhibition. I am also very grateful for the presence and guidance of guests from home and abroad. Unfortunately, the works of my colleagues are not very brilliant, and I am afraid that they will not meet the expectations of the refined audience. I am very ashamed and apologetic, and I hope for your expert guidance. Civilized countries in the world all know the relationship between art and life, so they all strive to promote and encourage it. Ancient China was the same. The Song Dynasty established a painting academy and even used painting to select officials. Chinese painting reached its peak during the Song Dynasty, with all methods perfected and all styles proficient, truly worthy of being called the golden age of Chinese art. Unfortunately, each generation after the Song Dynasty was worse than the previous, and now it can be said to be extremely declining. However, since the Republic of China, it seems that there is a glimmer of hope, a good omen of reversal. In general, the Chinese Renaissance will be at this time. I feel that the more developed the world's science is, the more rampant human desires become. If we do not vigorously practice Eastern art to harmonize with the spirit, I am afraid that mankind will not be able to enjoy the happiness of science. Because academic harmony is closely related to national harmony, I often feel that the art education in the world, both East and West, is somewhat biased. It seems necessary to harmonize, adopt, and exchange strengths. Eastern art emphasizes the void, while Western art emphasizes the real. Seeking reason from reality emphasizes scientific materialism. The good thing about Western painting is that it is truly in harmony with nature and assimilated to it. In recent decades, Western art has also had a tendency towards Easternization, and it is known the beauty of Eastern lines, but lines are only one method of constructing painting, only a part. Chinese painting emphasizes the essence of the spirit and is not limited to this. It needs to be based on literature, what is called learning from nature externally and obtaining the source from the heart internally, not focusing solely on skills and colors. For example, when painting landscapes, it is not enough to just paint a hill or a gully. One scene ends, and another scene arises, what is called 'When the mountains and rivers are exhausted and there seems to be no way out, the willows are dark and the flowers are bright, and there is another village.' Therefore, a painting is full of poetic meaning and philosophy, and the interest of calligraphy is in it. Sometimes, although there are only a few strokes, using ink sparingly, but this abstract beauty of the spirit that transcends the image can give the viewer a sense of beauty that is remaining and inexhaustible, like the meaning beyond the strings of music, the flavor beyond the taste of poetry, and the painting beyond the painting. Transmitting the spirit and conveying the meaning beyond the male and female orioles, bewildering and mysterious, profound and profound. We Eastern artists hold a view of life that is lofty and transcends the world. No matter how difficult the environment is, as long as there is a piece of paper, we can go to the world to depict all the sorrows of society. As long as there is a zither, we can play out our full of sorrow and indignation and infinite aspirations. Therefore, artists rarely violate their conscience because of material things. But in this evil world of the weak eating the strong and rampant desires, it seems that we should embrace the strengths of the Eastern artistic spirit and contribute it to the world as much as possible, like injecting an ampoule of tranquilizer. Moreover, beauty is a harmonizing agent of various relative qualities. We should broaden our vision, abandon the narrow Monroe Doctrine of Chinese painting, and expand it to the universalism of world art, so that art can be used to connect international emotions and to fully express the cruel and evil war and the sorrow of mankind, thereby promoting the world peace movement. I hope that weapons will be melted into the light of the sun and the moon. This is my earnest hope. If there are any mistakes in the works of my colleagues, I hope that you will give your guidance." After Gao finished his speech, his daughter Ms. Gao Lihua gave a report in English.</p>
<p>Famous Painting Collection: The Gao and students' art exhibition displays a total of 371 works. In addition to Gao's works, there are also works by his wife Ms. Song Minghuang, his daughter Ms. Gao Lihua, and his students Rong Dakui and Wu Gonghu, among others. Gao's works, "Wind and Rain Soaking Stallions," "Autumn Wind," and "Cold Forest Misty Barrier," are all considered masterpieces. His famous work "Battle of Shanghai" depicts the ruins of the Oriental Library, with blazing fire, especially able to make people deeply reflect. The municipal museum plans to collect it to commemorate it permanently.</p>

<p>Donated 1,000 Yuan to Flood Relief Association Yesterday</p>
<p>Former Qing Dynasty Minister Chen Kuilong celebrated his 80th birthday the day before yesterday. Chen, considering the severity of last year's floods and the widespread disaster, donated his 1,000-yuan birthday gift to the Flood Relief Association yesterday to help with disaster relief and to aid the victims. He also sent a letter to the association, stating, "I am writing to you to inform you that, in celebration of my 80th birthday yesterday, I have saved on banquet expenses and respectfully donated 1,000 yuan in national currency to your esteemed association for the benefit of the guests. I hope that you will remit the funds to the disaster areas, and I will be eternally grateful. This is addressed to the Shanghai Flood Relief Association."</p>
<h3 id="e116">All Sectors Sponsor Plane Purchases to Celebrate Birthday <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The China Aviation Association is expanding the Aviation Save-the-Nation Movement. The Shanghai Fundraising Committee for Purchasing Aircraft to Present to the Government in Commemoration of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 50th Birthday previously sent a circular to all entertainment venues in the city, scheduling one day for the income to be transferred to donations to improve performance. The Golden Grand Theater, Common Stage, Grand Stage, Empire, New Era Stage, Tianchan Stage, Old Gate Grand Theater, Wing On, Sincere, New World, Fu'an, and other recreational places, and St. Anna's, Mainland, Great East, Far East, and other dance halls, have been held successively, with excellent results. The details have been repeatedly published in newspapers. The Huiling Dance Hall is scheduled to hold the event tomorrow evening. At 8:00 PM tomorrow evening, martial arts masters will perform Tai Chi Chuan, Tai Chi Sword, and Freestyle Dancing. The Xiaoyao Dance Hall will be moved to an open-air dance floor on July 1st, inviting singers to sing and famous dancers to accompany the dancing. Also, the Lao Dahua, International, Victory, and Good Friends dance halls have also decided to organize the event and are in the process of determining the dates.</p>
<p>All the industry associations in the city are working hard to raise funds for purchasing aircraft to celebrate the birthday. It is reported that the Rice Dealers Association recently held a meeting of the Standing Committee and resolved to widely solicit donations from its members, divided into four grades: Grade A, 8 yuan; Grade B, 6 yuan; Grade C, 4 yuan; and Grade D, 2 yuan. The response from donors has been very enthusiastic, and it is scheduled to end at the end of next month. The results will be very impressive.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Chinese and Foreign Relief Association Cooperation Praised by League of Nations Cooperation Expert <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission, located at 505 Henan Road, is the advocate of the domestic rural cooperation cause. The cooperatives sponsored and guided by the association have reached more than 10,000 locations nationwide, and Hebei Province is the first pilot area. The number of cooperatives and the excellence of the results are the best in all regions. Mr. Gamble, the British consultant of the League of Nations Cooperation Expert National Economic Committee, visited Peiping last month with Zhou Fang, a commissioner of the Economic Committee, to learn from each other. They asked the association to lead them to visit. The association assigned Liu Zhaochang, the chief of the Inspection Section of the Agricultural and Irrigation Department, to accompany them on field inspections. Mr. Gamble returned to Peiping the day before yesterday and released a report on his findings, praising the achievements of various cooperatives. The main points are translated as follows: Since the China International Famine Relief Commission advocated the Chinese cooperative movement, it has been promoted with great effort and has made daily progress. It is now spreading throughout the country, and the effectiveness is gradually showing. If it can continue unremittingly, it will undoubtedly benefit the people's livelihood. The association's contribution to the cause is truly undeniable. Hebei Province is the first area where the association founded cooperatives, and it devoted its full efforts to it. The achievements are the best in the country. The farmers in the province also enjoyed the benefits of cooperation the earliest. To this day, word of mouth praises it, and there is good reason for this. Ordinary charitable organizations are only concerned with relieving immediate disasters, but they often neglect the elimination of the causes of the disaster. The association has a broad vision, advocates cooperation, and strives for the happiness of farmers. It is appropriate that its reputation is spreading throughout the country.</p>

<p>Prove that Cloth from Da Hsin National Cloth Factory is a National Product; Please Investigate and Release Immediately to Facilitate the Sales of National Products</p>
<p>The China National Products Maintenance Association sent a letter to the Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs and the Inspector General of Customs, stating: "We are writing to you regarding the issue of releasing cloth from the Da Hsin Cloth Factory. We have received a letter from our member, the Da Hsin Cloth Factory in Tianjin, stating that a box of cloth stored at the closed port of the factory was shipped back to Shanghai on the Haiyuan ship on May 8th. However, the Jianghai Customs mistakenly identified it as foreign goods and required that duties be paid before it could be released. Although they submitted the factory's and Hong Kong's cargo ledgers, sample trademarks, and national product certificate, the customs has not approved the release. We are therefore writing to request that your association forward a letter to the Jianghai Customs to certify that the goods are national products and to release them promptly to facilitate the sales of national products. After reviewing the factory's details, we found that the factory is located at Jiangyi Hutong, Houjiahou, Tianjin, and has been selling various cloths with the hexagonal 'Zhongxin' trademark throughout the country for many years. The factory has been verified by the factory association and found to be in compliance with the national product standards promulgated by the Ministry of Industry, and has been issued National Product Certificate No. 111. The goods shipped back to Shanghai this time from the factory's Hong Kong warehouse consist of 30 yards of worsted wool for ten pieces, 30 yards of Xiangfei plaid for ten pieces, and three pieces of canvas, all packed in one box. There is no doubt that they are national products. Therefore, we are sending this special letter with attached trademarks, samples, and the certificate to certify that the cloth is indeed a national product manufactured by the factory. We earnestly request your customs office to instruct the relevant departments to investigate and release the goods to benefit the sales of national products. We are deeply grateful for your public-spiritedness."</p>

<p>Request Taxpayers' Association to Negotiate with Municipal Council</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Mutual Aid Association, regarding the Municipal Council's scheduled implementation of the wheel modification issue, printed and distributed a questionnaire to all members to ascertain their attitude. According to the filled-out questionnaires, all members believe that it is already difficult to maintain their livelihoods under the current strict business conditions. How can they suddenly increase unnecessary burdens? Therefore, they unanimously expressed their firm opposition and requested that the Taxpayers' Association negotiate with the Municipal Council to revoke this order to reduce the burden on workers. In order to accept the public opinion, the directors and supervisors of the association held a joint meeting and resolved to send a letter to all the Chinese directors and commissioners of the Taxpayers' Association, requesting them to negotiate with the Municipal Council and to take into account the difficult times and withdraw the order. It is now learned that the association has received a reply from the Taxpayers' Association, stating, "We have received your letter regarding the wheel modification issue.

<h3 id="e121">Iron Department Approves Incentives for Transporting Domestically Produced Porcelain <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Effective July 1st</p>
<p>Railway Bureau News: In the past, to encourage the transportation of domestically produced porcelain from Jiangxi via railway, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau drafted "Measures for Packaging, Transportation, and Incentives for Jiangxi Domestically Produced Porcelain" and submitted it to the Ministry of Railways. The Ministry ordered the Bureau to jointly draft special through rates. Both parties carefully discussed the matter and, referring to the original measures proposed by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, stipulated that "Jiangxi domestically produced porcelain transported via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway will be charged at the third-class rate if packaged in crates or barrels. All other forms of packaging for Jiangxi domestically produced porcelain will be charged at the fifth-class rate." This was established as a special through rate and applied the "distance reduction" method for through freight, so that domestically produced porcelain from other places with different packaging would not be affected. Furthermore, as the sales range of Jiangxi domestically produced porcelain is very wide, it was proposed that the above-mentioned special through rate should be uniformly applied by all connecting railways. This was jointly submitted to the Ministry for approval by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Now, the Ministry Order No. 5506 states, "Approval is granted to proceed accordingly, effective from July 1st. However, these measures are only a specific method for distinguishing the grades of Jiangxi domestically produced porcelain based on packaging methods and are not limited to application on these two railways. Moreover, when through transport from Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to other railways occurs, the 'distance reduction' method shall naturally apply, but it shall not be referred to as a special through rate." The Bureau has already instructed the Transportation Department to comply accordingly.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Bar Association issued a notice to all members yesterday, which stated: "We hereby notify you that we have received Instruction No. 9987 from the Jiangsu Higher Court, stating: 'The practice of law by lawyers should be conducted in ordinary courts, as stipulated in Article 1 of the Lawyers' Regulations. They may not practice law in county governments that concurrently handle judicial affairs. This has also been interpreted and recorded in Supreme Court Resolution No. 123 of the 17th year of the Republic. However, it has recently been found that some lawyers have established offices in areas under county governments that concurrently handle judicial affairs, employing clerks to solicit lawsuits or even serving as legal advisors to local merchants and residents, advertising widely, and engaging in promotion. Such conduct is inconsistent with the aforementioned laws and regulations and is highly inappropriate. In addition to separately ordering the counties that concurrently handle judicial affairs to investigate and prohibit such activities, we hereby order your association to notify all members to comply strictly and pay close attention to this matter.' Upon receipt of this, a corresponding letter is sent to you for your information and compliance."</p>

<p>Firefighters Injured During Brave Rescue Efforts</p>
<p>The Fengnian Senji Dyeing and Weaving Factory, located at No. 23 to No. 25 Beizhufan Lane, Zhongxing Road, Zhabei, is owned by Kan Peisheng from Anhui Province. Yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, a fire suddenly broke out on the ground floor of the factory, quickly spreading throughout. Flames soared, and the fire also spread to the neighboring Tongsheng Cloth Factory at No. 22. At the time, the fire illuminated the sky and was uncontrollable. Fortunately, the fire brigades from various sections of Zhabei had received the alert and rushed fire engines to the scene to attempt to extinguish the fire, preventing further spread. The fire was completely extinguished after about an hour. As a result, four buildings were burned down. Kan Peisheng, the owner of the factory where the fire originated, was taken to the Zhongxing Road Police Station for questioning. However, during the height of the fire, Sun Shengshen, a 30-year-old firefighter from the Hongzhen District Fire Brigade, saw the raging fire and fearlessly rushed to the rescue. He carelessly fell from a height, injuring his head and losing consciousness on the spot. He was quickly transported to the hospital by ambulance for treatment and regained consciousness. His injuries are not considered serious.</p>

<p>U.S. Imports Exceeded Several Million Dollars Last Period</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency: According to the International Trade Bureau, the Ministry of Commerce's simplified chemical examination report stated that exports had increased by 70% compared to previous periods. The total consumption in 1935 was 127,600,000 pounds. This tung oil almost entirely came from China, with only a small amount supplied by the Gulf Coast of the United States. Other new tung oil industries are gradually emerging. Based on the average price of 18 cents per pound this year, the tung oil used by the American paint industry in 1936 accounted for about 75% of the total value. The total consumption in 1935 was 98,440,000 pounds. The oilcloth industry ranked second, with a consumption of 10,390,000 pounds in 1935, a significant increase compared to 7,300,000 pounds in 1932. The paint industry used a total of 2,003,000 pounds of tung oil last year, compared to 713,000 pounds in 1932. In 1935, the consumption by other industries totaled 10,756,000 pounds, compared to 7,892,000 pounds in 1932. The tung oil used by the electrical industry, the plywood industry, waterproofing compounds, automotive fabrics, and raincoat manufacturing is also considerable. According to other news, tung oil exports have been very good in the first half of this year. U.S. sales reached over ten million dollars, an increase compared to the same period last year. Exports to other countries such as England, Germany, France, and Italy have also been active. Therefore, there is still much hope for the future of tung oil exports.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Land Officials Accused of Extortion Case Tried Yesterday <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Both Sides Present Evidence</p>
<p>The case of Shanghai Land Bureau Second Technology Section Chief Ye Changfu and Technician Zhang Zhenfan, accused by citizen Han Qixiang of extorting 1,200 yuan for upgrading land plans, was tried yesterday by Judge Wu after being prosecuted by the District Court Prosecutor. The defendants Ye Changfu and Zhang Zhenfan, represented by a lawyer, argued in court that Han Qixiang, also known as Jin Tucheng, had applied for an exemption from upgrading the land plans for the 451st base within the Over-the-word Embankment in the 25th Bao district, claiming that there were errors in the road plan. However, the chief and technician were acting on instructions from the Third Section, and approval or rejection was up to the section chief. The road was to be upgraded, and it had been verified and confirmed as a settled case during the tenure of the previous bureau director in the 23rd year of the Republic. There was no possibility of seeking bribes, and this was clearly inconsistent with the facts. Han Qixiang claimed that he dined at the Quanxingkang Hotel and had a menu as proof, but the food on the menu could be obtained by anyone and could not serve as evidence. Han Qiqiang claimed that Wang and Lu, two friends, were present at the banquet at the Quanxingkang Hotel. If they were friends in attendance, why did he not know their names and addresses? This was not truthful and was clearly a false accusation due to unmet requests. Han Qixiang also claimed that he contacted a man named Tao Asheng to apply for a land business license, who said that a bribe of 1,200 yuan was required, which would include the upgrading of land. He had tea at Yile Tian and dined at Quanxingkang Hotel, but because negotiations failed, his rights were harmed. The judge stated that since both sides had evidence, he would summon witnesses for a retrial.</p>

<p>Knowing It Was Inevitable, She Reported to the Court</p>
<p>Lu Laoqi, also known as Wenying, the female kingpin of the Flower Association, was previously wanted by the French Concession Police Department through the Second Special District Court. Last winter, Inspector Qian Chenglong and detectives from the Old Zhabei Police Station captured Lu in Yuren Lane in the Public Concession and brought her to the Second Special District Court. The Legal Affairs Office of the Police Department prosecuted her according to law. After trial, she was sentenced to one year and six months of penal servitude and fined 2,000 yuan. During the appeal period, she posted a bond of 6,000 yuan with a shop as guarantor. Later, because Lu did not accept the original judgment, she appealed to the Third Branch of the Higher Court. As a result, the original sentence was reduced by six months, and she was sentenced to one year of penal servitude. However, the fine portion remained at the original 2,000 yuan. Recently, the Second Branch of the Higher Court finalized the case and summoned Lu to report for execution of the sentence. Lu submitted a petition claiming illness and requesting a postponement, which was rejected by the court. The guarantor was ordered to bring Lu to the case. Knowing that it was unavoidable, Lu voluntarily reported to the Third Branch of the Higher Court the day before yesterday and was interrogated by the executing judge. The bailiffs were ordered to send her to the prison for execution.</p>

<p>However, Forgiveness Is Not Granted; Case Concluded and Awaiting Judgment</p>
<p>Yang Meixing, a local man, is 28 years old and resides at No. 2 Yangjia House, Huangxing Road, Zhabei. He used to work as a comprador on a ship but is now unemployed. Yang previously married Ms. Xu (23 years old this year) and lives with her. They have children. Yang's elder sister is married to Tan Yunjun (25 years old this year), a local man residing at No. 25 Kangnao Road. Tan works at the Free Farm. Yang's wife, Ms. Xu, is naturally frivolous. Starting from the first month of the lunar calendar last year, she had an affair with her husband's brother-in-law, Tan Yunjun. She often used excuses to go out and secretly meet at hotels, engaging in secret rendezvous for more than a year. Yang and his sister were completely unaware. On the 21st, Yang's wife, Ms. Xu, went to the home of relatives at No. 2 Sanxin Lane, Caishi Road, in the French Concession. She had arranged with Tan to meet at the entrance of the Central Cinema at 6:00 PM that day and go to a hotel for further pleasure. At 6:00 PM that afternoon, Ms. Xu came out of Sanxin Lane and took a trolleybus to the Central Cinema to wait for Tan. Tan was already waiting. After the two met, they went to a restaurant on Avenue Dubail for dinner. At 7:00 PM, they went to the Dadong New Hotel at No. 94 Xixinqiao Street and opened Room 107 for illicit intercourse. Unexpectedly, their good fortune was short-lived. Yang's and Ms. Xu's trip to the hotel was spotted by Yang Meixing's friend Hu Shiquan (28 years old, local man), who tailed them to the hotel and immediately reported to Yang.</p>
<p>Yang immediately rushed to the French Concession Police Department to report. Detectives were dispatched to the Dadong New Hotel to arrest them. At the time, the adulterer and adulteress were both naked in bed. The detectives ordered them to get dressed and took them to the police station for detention. The next day, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. Lawyer Yuan Jiahuang from the Police Affairs Office presented the case, prosecuting them for the crime of disrupting the family. Then, the plaintiff, Yang Meixing, complained that the defendants had committed adultery and requested strict investigation. The court declared that the case involved morality and announced that onlookers were prohibited. It was heard that the defendants admitted to having committed adultery for a long time. Ms. Xu Yang repented to her husband in court, asking the court for leniency, but the plaintiff did not grant it. The court ordered the conclusion of the debate and set the judgment for the 29th. The defendants were sent back to detention.</p>

<p>Mother Also Conspired; All Involved Arrested</p>
<p>Wen Xiushan, a 40-year-old from Funing, residing at No. 31 Wuzhou Road, recently married a Ms. Wu from the same hometown, who is 21 years old. She is naturally frivolous and often goes out wandering. If slightly reprimanded, she would retort. On the 17th of last month, they had a major argument over a trivial matter, and she left without saying goodbye, secretly going to her mother's place in Shenjiatan, Yangshupu. Later, she wrote a letter to her husband requesting a divorce. She was sent back by her mother on the 29th. At 8:00 PM on the 9th of this month, she went out for a walk and never returned. Wen searched everywhere, but there was no news. Until the day before yesterday, he learned that Xiao Jinbao, a leather worker and neighbor from the same hometown, had arranged for her to have an affair with Wang Debao, a Yancheng native residing at No. 21 Yangshupu Road, and took Ms. Wu to a place in Ningbo to hide. Wang's mother, Ms. Ni, also conspired.

<p>Falsely Claiming to Be Patriotic Youth Association; Qiu Has Presented It to the Court for Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>Qiu Chunshan, from Zhenjiang, has been in Shanghai for over 20 years. He is the chairman of the city's rickshaw association, the supervisor of the Chunhua Silk Edging Factory's union, and a representative to the city's Chamber of Commerce. He is a well-known member of the middle class. A few days ago, he was suddenly assassinated in a deserted area west of the South Railway Station, suffering five axe wounds and nearly dying. The Municipal Public Security Bureau sent him to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. While the matter was being investigated, the culprits distributed leaflets falsely claiming that the Patriotic Youth Association was behind the attack. Qiu believes that the assault and the leaflets were the work of the same person and has learned that it was motivated by jealousy from a competitor seeking to replace him. He has presented a petition to the District Court for thorough investigation. The prosecutor has visited the hospital to examine the injuries, secretly questioned him about the details, and ordered the arrest of the suspects.</p>

<p>Chen Weiling Suffered Significant Injury; Liang Shaoqian Must Pay Over a Thousand Gold</p>
<p>Chen Weiling, an employee of the Dazhonghang on Henan Road, had a conflict with Liang Shaoqian, a Cantonese employee of the Continental Ballroom, late on the night of April 10th. As a result, Chen's left wrist was slashed with a knife, and the bone was broken. The police arrested Liang and handed him over to the First Special District Court, which sentenced Liang to eight months of penal servitude with a three-year reprieve. Chen's incidental civil suit was transferred to the civil court. Chen then hired lawyer Jiang Chiping to file a civil suit with the Civil Division of the First Special District Court, seeking compensation for damages and medical expenses, totaling over 7,200 yuan. Because Chen's hand has been disabled since the injury and he can no longer work, the court ordered a medical assessment, which found that although Chen's injury did not reach the level of disability, he had lost one-third of his working ability. Judge Li Hu, who presided over the trial, ordered Liang Shaoqian to compensate Chen Weiling for damages and medical expenses in the amount of 1,036.80 national currency yesterday morning.</p>

<p>Since the Municipal Public Security Bureau began registering smokers, many smokers who did not understand the anti-smoking laws have gone to the bureau to inquire. There has also been a constant stream of people requesting to quit smoking and obtaining smoking cessation registration forms. To facilitate smokers' inquiries about anti-smoking laws and to obtain smoking cessation registration forms, the bureau consulted with the Public Education Center of the Confucius Temple Park and specially allocated a room to establish a smoker inquiry office. The internal arrangements have been completed, and the office officially opened yesterday. The bureau's public notice for the establishment of the smoker inquiry office is copied below: "In order to guide smokers on registration procedures and to clarify the anti-smoking laws, the bureau has established a smoker registration inquiry office in the Nanshi Public Education Center (Confucius Temple Park). It will open for business on the 23rd of this month. Citizens who are unclear about registration, licensing, smoking cessation procedures, or anti-smoking laws should go to the office to inquire.

<p>Near the Nanshi Cemetery Pier, a young man suddenly appeared at around 12:00 AM last night, wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants, standing alone in a secluded spot. After looking around and seeing no one, he untied the hemp rope from his waist and tied it to the high railing of the wooden fence, then put the noose around his neck, intending to hang himself. At that moment, Chen Amao, a boatman on a sampan docked at the pier, saw the scene and was greatly alarmed. He jumped ashore and cut the man down. Because it had not been long, he was saved. He reported to the Shanghai Municipal Water Patrol. After questioning by the team leader, the man said his name was Shi Yu Gao, 18 years old, from Minhou County. His brother, Yu Shi, is a second-class soldier on the Xianning warship. They came to Shanghai together the day before yesterday, but he got lost near Xiaodongmen. The warship had already sailed to Nanjing, and he was stranded in a foreign land with no relatives. He had no choice but to attempt suicide. Team Leader Wei, based on the statement, felt pity for him and has submitted a request to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to provide assistance.</p>

<p>Zhang Ye'er of the Mental Troupe Pulled a Prank; Zhou Xiangsheng Startled Upon Seeing Newspaper</p>
<p>The previous day, all the local newspapers published an advertisement warning "Modern Young Master" Yan Runfu, listing fifteen creditors, including Xiangsheng Automobile Company and Hongxiang Fashion Company. Because the wording of the advertisement was serious, readers suspected that Yan Runfu actually existed. The creditors listed above, such as Xiangsheng Automobile Company, also had misunderstandings, suspecting that their store names had been falsely listed. A reporter from Datong News Agency has revealed the truth: Zhang Ye'er, the protagonist of the Mental Troupe performing at the New World Company, is preparing to perform the play "Modern Young Master" on the 30th of this month at the Xinguang Grand Theater. To attract attention, he created a false impression by publishing the advertisement. However, he did not contact the creditors listed in the advertisement beforehand. Zhou Xiangsheng, the manager of Xiangsheng Automobile Company, discovered the advertisement the previous morning and was very concerned. Later, Zhang Ye'er sent a clerk to notify him, and he was relieved. This is also an amusing anecdote.</p>

<p>Shi Xinlou, a young man from Shaoxing, wandered around Shanghai with no occupation. Recently, due to the pressure of life, he had a whimsical idea. Dressed as a student, he used the guise of visiting schoolmates to sneak into dormitories to steal. At around 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, Shi again sneaked into the Sino-French School near Baxianqiao in the French Concession, intending to steal students' books (since the school had no dormitories, all students were day students). He was spotted by a teacher, Father (priest), who suspected that Shi was not a student of the school and looked suspicious. Also, four students, including Ge Hua ran, had their expensive French books stolen a few days ago. He detained Shi and called the police. According to Shi's confession, he stole eight books and sold them to Dafeng and Shan Ye bookstores on Zhonghua Road in Nanshi to get money. Detective Xu Daorong took Shi to the Dafeng Bookstore to retrieve six of the original books. The two books received by the Shan Ye Bookstore had already been resold to others and could not be retrieved. Yesterday, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. The Police Affairs Office lawyer requested an adjournment for investigation and prosecution. Judge Chen Pusheng verified the report and briefly questioned the defendant, ordering a retrial at a later date. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>Mother Shouted in the Streets to Find Her Daughter; Many Shady Details Awaiting Further Investigation</p>
<p>Jiang Zhai, a 37-year-old woman from Wuxi, lives in the countryside of Wuxi. Her husband died of illness six years ago, leaving behind two daughters, the elder named Jisheng, 16 years old, and the younger named Aisheng, 13 years old. However, since the death of her husband, Jiang Zhai, not accustomed to sleeping alone, became involved with Wang Laoer (i.e., Jiang Xianzai). Jiang Aisheng had a foster father named Lu Jinsong who, last year, under the pretext of recommending her for factory work, brought Aisheng from Wuxi to Shanghai. On the 29th of last month, Lu Jinsong suddenly went to Jiang Zhai's home in Wuxi, saying that Aisheng was seriously ill in Shanghai and that Jisheng needed</p>
<p>to visit her.</p>
<p>Jiang Zhai did not know his plan. She had her eldest daughter Jisheng follow Lu to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, Lu secretly colluded with Wang Laoer, Gao Laoqi, etc., and forced Jiang Jisheng into a prostitute house opened by Zhang Asi, a Yangzhou native, at No. 18 Hongxiang Lane, No. 57 Xinzha Road. They set a four-year term and got 181 yuan as her starting price. From then on, Jiang Jisheng fell into the fiery pit, renamed Xiaomei. Every night, Zhang Asi dispatched a maid to accompany her to the rooftop garden of Wing On Company</p>
<p>to solicit customers.</p>
<p>The money earned each night was managed by Zhang. For several days, the Jiang girl,</p>
<p>unable to bear the pain,</p>
<p>escaped privately late one night while the accompanying maid was not paying attention. She went to live temporarily at the home of a fellow villager. But after Jiang girl disappeared, Zhang Asi negotiated with Lu Jinsong, etc. Lu and Wang Laoer, etc., tried to find Jiang Jisheng and sent her to the home of Cai Shunhai, a Changzhou native, at No. 87 Arrabella Street</p>
<p>for surveillance. Unexpectedly,</p>
<p>the matter was discovered by Jiang Zhai, who arrived in Shanghai by train yesterday</p>
<p>to find her daughter</p>
<p>directly to the area of Arrabella Street. Because she did not know the house number, she shouted her daughter Jisheng's name along the way. Jisheng heard her, eagerly stuck her head out of the building window, and greeted each other. Ms. Jiang entered the house to take Jisheng away, but she was stopped by Cai Shunhai, causing a conflict and chaos. Hua Police No. 458 saw this and brought Jiang Zhai, Jiang Jisheng, and Cai Shunhai</p>
<p>to the Huishi Police Station,</p>
<p>where they learned the details and transferred them to the Xinzha Police Station. Chinese detective Yang Fusheng went to No. 18 Hongxiang Lane, Xinwen Road, to arrest Zhang Asi and his son Zhang Yusheng (18 years old) together</p>
<p>at the police station</p>
<p>for detention. Yesterday morning, Police Station Lawyer Zhang Tianyin charged Zhang Asi and his son with the crime of disrupting the family under Article 203 of the Criminal Code, and Cai Shunhai with the crime of restricting freedom under Article 300 of the Criminal Code. The content of this case is complicated, and Lu Jinsong was captured this morning, so he requested permission to postpone the trial. Also, according to Jiang Zhai and Jiang Jisheng, who successively surrendered, the above situation was explained. When asked about Zhang Asi, he admitted that he spent 181 yuan to buy Jiang Jisheng as an adopted daughter. At first, he wanted her to</p>
<p>learn to dance.</p>
<p>Later, because he knew that Jiang was not a virgin and because she voluntarily took up the life of a goddess, he accompanied her to public places to receive guests. Unexpectedly, Jiang girl ran away privately after only three days. It was discovered that Tu Laoer's real name was Jiang Xianzai, who was a pigeon keeper by trade, and that he really used fraudulent means to</p>
<p>obtain my money, etc.</p>
<p>Zhang Yusheng said that he serves as</p>
<p>a set designer</p>
<p>I have nothing to do with this matter and hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him, stating that there were many shady details in this case and that the master criminal, Wang Laoer, could not be captured, so it should</p>
<p>allow bail.</p>
<p>Cai Shunhai said that Jiang Jisheng was sent to my place by Wang Laoer et al. for temporary residence, and I don't know anything else. After Judge Tan Zheng verified the statement, the court ordered that the case be retried on the 26th. Zhang Yusheng, Cai Shunhai, Jiang Zhai, and Jiang Jisheng were each released</p>
<p>with guarantees. Zhang Asi was returned to custody.</p>

<p>Sues to Revoke the Concubine's Guardianship Rights; Jurisdiction Issues Require Investigation</p>
<p>Zhang Hebo, a wealthy merchant from Wuxian County, Suzhou, married Yao Shuhui as his principal wife and later took Yuanru as a concubine. Zhang Hebo passed away from illness twelve years ago. At the time, Li was pregnant and had not yet given birth. After Zhang's death, she gave birth to a son named Yi Xin, who is now thirteen years old. Li has been raising him, but recently, Li has been found to be immoral. Zhang Yao Shuhui is concerned about the harm this may cause to Yi Xin's future education. Therefore, she retained lawyers Chen Tingrui and Xu Yinlu to file a lawsuit against Li Yuanru in the First Special District Court, citing Articles 1090 and 1094, Clause 5 of the Civil Code and Precedent No. 1974 of the Supreme Court in the 20th year of the Republic, requesting a judgment to terminate her guardianship of Yi Xin and to allow the plaintiff to convene a family council to select a new guardian. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Dai Rongduo of the Civil Court No. 14 summoned the parties. The defendant also retained lawyer Wang Chuanbi to defend her case, raising a jurisdictional issue, stating that the defendant currently resides at No. 104 Hulong Street, Suzhou, so the plaintiff should file the lawsuit with the Wuxian County Court, requesting a preliminary ruling. Plaintiff's lawyer Chen Tingrui stated that since Zhang Hebo's death, the defendant had remarried to a man named Li Dingsheng (also known as Zhiyun), who initially lived on Yunnan Road, then moved to No. 8 Guanhua Lane, Lafayette Road, and in early November of last year, moved to No. 122 Chibang Road, and recently resides at No. 10, Lane 652, Xinzha Road. Furthermore, the summons was delivered by the plaintiff and received by Li Dingsheng, indicating that the defendant does reside in Shanghai, so there is no jurisdictional issue. The court immediately announced that the defendant's summons had been returned to the court by Li Dingsheng with a letter, which was handed to lawyer Chen. The letter claimed that he and Li Yuanru were siblings. Lawyer Chen presented a photo of Li Dingsheng, Li Yuanru, and Zhang Yi Xin together, as well as letters, to prove that they were indeed husband and wife. After review, the judge ruled that an investigation was needed to verify jurisdiction. Therefore, the case was adjourned for further hearing.</p>

In order to facilitate the staff of various offices nearby, the hall has specially invited the female dancers who participate in the tea dance to also serve as dinner dance partners. After the dinner dance, instead of going home immediately, they continue to the tea dance, so that people from all walks of life can come to the hall to cool off and relieve boredom when they are tired and unable to express themselves after dinner.

<h3 id="e155">Contributing to the Nanyang Commercial Survey Group <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>According to reports, the Shanghai China Industrial Foreign Trade Association has recently organized a Nanyang Commercial Survey Group to actively promote domestic products for export, open up foreign markets, and develop overseas trade. It has been decided that starting from the 3rd of next month, groups will depart to various places in Nanyang – Manila, Surabaya, Batavia, Singapore, Penang, Saigon, Siam, Medan, and other places – to conduct surveys, and will carry a large number of domestic product samples and specimens to distribute to various places for promotion, and to establish close ties with the local business community, which is a precursor to the promotion of domestic products overseas.</p>
<p>In the current situation where the entire domestic product sector is struggling through stormy conditions, we are indeed happy to hear this encouraging news. We know that in the past and present, there are many compatriots overseas, especially in various parts of Nanyang, who are eagerly longing for the motherland and demanding domestic products. Therefore: We are bound to receive a grand welcome on this trip, but on the other hand, we must ensure that we completely satisfy them. I hope that the members of the survey group will work hard to fulfill the pioneering mission and conduct practical work, especially paying attention to the following three points: Now, I write down these words as my small contribution:</p>
<p>First, expand publicity. The Nanyang region has originally been occupied by foreign goods, and there are many compatriots there who truly want to use domestic products but cannot obtain them. Therefore, we must expand publicity for domestic products on this trip, and pay attention to the production of advertisements and commodity samples, so that they first have a deep impression of domestic products, and at the same time, understand the principles of Chinese people applying domestic goods, so that everyone loves to use domestic products.</p>
<p>Second, establish permanent exhibition halls. After our trip, we should take advantage of the enthusiastic goodwill of compatriots from all walks of life towards domestic products, and take a further step to plan the establishment of permanent domestic product exhibition halls there, so that the local residents and vendors can have a more adequate understanding, and can continue to subscribe from domestic product manufacturers in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Third, solve various difficult problems. The reason why domestic products could not be sold to Nanyang in the past was because many technical difficulties hindered them. This time, we must work together with the local business community to obtain appropriate solutions to problems such as packaging, shipping and bank financing, and currency system budgeting for exchange rates, in order to facilitate the future development and progress of trade.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Strengthening Trade Associations <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>To seek the development of China's domestic industrial goods, nothing is better than strengthening trade associations. The revision of the Law of Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations is particularly urgent. Recently, the Legislative Yuan's Ministry of Industry has proposed amendments to the Law of Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations. An important resolution of the 7th Member Representative Assembly of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, for strengthening the organization of merchant groups, that businesses must join the trade association, and trade associations must join the Chamber of Commerce, has been unanimously approved by the assembly. At this time, before the amended laws are promulgated, we should make seven preparations:</p>
<p>1. If there is no trade association, organize one as soon as possible to unify the purpose of the industry and standardize the steps of the industry.</p>
<p>2. After the trade association is organized, for those in the industry who have not joined, investigate and persuade them to join, so as to gather ideas and cooperate in case of trouble. Otherwise, as limited by laws and regulations, sooner or later they will not be able to stay outside the association and undermine the industry's front.</p>
<p>3. In addition to industrial and commercial trade associations, export trade associations should be organized to be a prelude to the development of foreign trade.</p>
<p>4. In addition to the Chamber of Commerce Law, the government should be asked to promulgate an Industrial Association Law, based on industrial trade associations, so that the industrial sector has a sound organization.</p>
<p>5. Trade associations should begin preparing for a strict organization with unified methods for tasks such as appraisal, inspection, statistics, production, and sales.</p>
<p>6. Amidst rampant smuggling, trade associations should strengthen defenses and take responsibility for inspecting products. If smuggled goods are found, they should be immediately seized to protect the industry.</p>
<p>The above is what our domestic goods industry should actively prepare for, and I hope that our government authorities will promote it as soon as possible to save the domestic goods industry from the brink of extinction.</p>
<h3 id="e158">The Need for Domestic Rubber Bands <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Feng</p>
<p>The "rubber bands" I am talking about now are the rubber bands used by major department stores, shops, and pharmacies on Nanjing Road for bundling things. Because these rubber bands can be adjusted to be tight or loose, they are simple and convenient. They are better than linen thread and gauze ribbons. And their value is very low, not much different from linen thread and gauze ribbons. Therefore, it is more convenient to use rubber bands than to use linen thread and printed gauze ribbons. Therefore, most new-style large companies and large stores use rubber bands to bundle things.</p>
<p>Speaking of rubber bands, I have some feelings! According to a friend of mine who specializes in the stationery business, "Most of these rubber bands are of inferior quality. They sell very well in stationery supplies. The annual loss is not small..." From this point of view, it is just that the general small industrial sector and rubber manufacturers are not paying attention.</p>
<p>Japan is originally the most developed industrial country. Especially for daily necessities, creation and imitation can be described as meticulous. Chinese people in our industrially backward country have always loved foreign goods. How can they not be happy to use cheap and good goods? Now they supply us with simple and convenient rubber bands. In this atmosphere of serious "smuggling," these things are even cheaper. This makes us abandon domestic linen thread and gauze ribbons and become their loyal salesmen. In this "Civilian Domestic Goods Year," there is no shortage of domestic rubber manufacturers with foresight. Hurry up and imitate them to stop this trickle of loss. Don't think it is "small" and not worth caring about. You must know that in today's poverty-stricken Chinese social economy, we must have the "determination" not to buy foreign goods anymore! Otherwise, what about the "Women's Domestic Goods Year" that has been shouted hoarsely for the past few years? ... Isn't its effect equal to zero? If this continues, the social economic panic will lead to who knows what kind of field. That is the motive for writing this article. I place great hope in the efforts of our domestic rubber merchants!</p>
<h3 id="e159">Mr. Tai Yan Was a Practitioner of Promoting Domestic Goods <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Chou Cheng</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Taiyan of Yuhang passed away at 8:00 AM on the 14th of this month at No. 50 Jin Fan Road, Suzhou. When the bad news came, everyone, whether they knew him or not, expressed their condolences. In the late Qing Dynasty, he advocated revolution and was imprisoned in the Western Prison, but he did not change his aspirations. In the early Republic, Yuan Shikai tried to win him over and hired him as an advisor, but he was not used. Later, he was imprisoned, but he enjoyed himself with poetry and wine. He could be steadfast in wealth and honor, not moved by poverty and humbleness, and not yield to power. In his later years, he lectured at Wu Men and wrote extensively. At a time when morality was declining and human desires were rampant, we were relying on this master of simple learning to develop his knowledge to save people's hearts. How could we have expected that heaven would not favor him and that this wise man would depart? The country lost a veteran, and the scholarly world lost a mentor. How could we not be sad! People only know that Mr. Zhang was a revolutionary elder and a literary giant, but they do not know that he was also a practitioner of promoting domestic goods. I followed him for a long time, so I will record his good deeds in promoting domestic goods in this publication for imitation. I got to know Mr. Zhang after 1916. At that time, Li Huangpi was in power and presented him with the horizontal plaque "Southeast Simple Learning" and returned to the south, residing in a certain neighborhood in the French Concession. His son-in-law, Tai Cangsheng, was from Jiaxing and had studied at Xiushui School. He had the friendship of being from the same hometown and school as me. He introduced me to meet Mr. Zhang. At first, I thought that a revolutionary leader who had lived abroad for a long time would wear a Western suit, but my ideal did not match the reality. Mr. Zhang wore cotton and silk short shirt and pants outside, and a spun silk long gown over that. Not only did he not have the habits of a student studying abroad, but he also resembled an old country bumpkin. At that time, I was teaching at the Nanhui Volunteer School. From then on, every week, I would go to Shanghai to listen to his teachings and benefited a lot. Seeing that none of the clothes he wore were foreign goods, I asked him the reason. He said that Zhejiang Province has always produced silk, and the cotton and silk of Yuhang are even more famous. I (Mr. Zhang referred to himself) am from Zhejiang, and my籍隸 is from Yuhang. How could I not use the products of my hometown, but instead buy imported goods, causing the loss of economic rights? He also described in detail that cotton is soft and smooth and can absorb sweat. It is suitable for making short shirts and pants in both winter and summer, and it is also durable and can be called cheap and good. Before leaving, I was given a roll of cotton and silk, and he severely criticized those who were infected with Europeanization and learned only the superficial knowledge of foreigners. Regarding clothing, food, housing, and transportation, they imitated foreign countries in every way. He said that there was a joke about a gentleman's son from the countryside who studied abroad for many years. When he returned to China, he was wearing a Western suit and leather shoes, and he was proud and complacent, like a brand new person. He criticized everything in the country as worthless. One day, his father asked him to compare foreign countries with China and asked which was better. He first said that foreign countries have clear politics and united people, so the country is rich and the people are strong, which is better than China. Then he said that foreign houses are tall and spacious, and the streets are flat, so living is comfortable, which is better than China. His father was nodding in agreement when his son suddenly pointed to the moon in the sky and said, "I don't know why the moon in foreign countries is also brighter and more lovely than the moon in China." At this time, his father realized that he was blindly following, so he spoke nonsense. The above is a joke, but in fact, there are people who hate domestic goods and love foreign goods. They regard everything in China as dung and regard foreign goods as treasures. We, who study and understand the principles, should take a firm stand and not be possessed by foreign objects, so that we can save the already collapsing situation. His words were earnest and worthy of admiration. Therefore, there were very few imported goods among all the utensils and clothes in Taiyan's family. He bought Platinum Dragon cigarettes from the Nanyang Tobacco Company. Friends and relatives knew that he was a practitioner of promoting domestic goods, so the items they sent were also limited to domestic goods. I am afraid that outsiders know very little about this matter, so I will specifically point it out to inform the readers.</p>

<h3 id="e160">The Municipal Secondary and Normal School Graduation Joint Examination Concludes Successfully <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Marking has begun. Results will be announced in two weeks. Regulations for students who fail to advance to higher education or serve.</p>
<p>The municipal joint graduation examination for secondary and normal schools for the second semester of the 24th year of the Republic of China began on the 22nd and concluded successfully yesterday. Marking has begun, and details are as follows:</p>
<p>Successful conclusion. Yesterday was the second day. This year's examination concluded successfully because there were fewer subjects. The situation in the examination hall was still good. All test papers are stored in the office of the Joint Examination Committee, Zeng Huji. The marking committee for each subject has also begun marking. Because there are many candidates participating in this year's examination, marking is quite time-consuming. Work is now being accelerated, and results can be announced in about two weeks.</p>
<p>Calculating scores. The method for calculating the scores of each subject in this year's joint examination is to take 40% of the school's graduation score for each subject and 60% of the joint examination score for each subject. The combined score will be calculated using a percentage system. Decimals below the integer will be rounded off. 80 to 100 points is Grade A, 70 to 79 points is Grade B, 60 to 69 points is Grade C, and less than 60 points is Grade D. Grades A and B are passing, and Grade D is failing.</p>
<p>Advancement to higher education and service. Only those who pass all subjects in the graduation joint examination can graduate. Those who fail three or more subjects will be held back. Those who cannot be held back due to special circumstances may be given a certificate of completion by the original school, stating the scores of each subject in the graduation joint examination, and stamped with the graduation joint examination failure stamp. Those who fail one or two subjects will be allowed to continue to participate in the joint examination for those subjects twice in the next two years. They can only graduate after passing. If they still fail any subjects, they should take the Ministry of Education's joint examination subjects in the future. Students who fail one or two subjects and wish to go to higher education immediately may have the Education Bureau issue a certificate to apply for higher education, with a photo of the student attached, stamped with the Education Bureau seal, and stating the scores of each subject in the graduation joint examination. They will be allowed to apply for higher education first and be admitted as probationary students. After passing the joint examination for those subjects and obtaining a graduation certificate, they will be allowed to participate in the final semester examination or graduation examination of the school they have entered. Students who fail one or two subjects and go to other provinces or cities for higher education or service may have the original school submit a request to the Education Bureau to forward it to the education administrative organ in the area where the student is studying or serving, to allow them to participate in the local graduation joint examination to make up for the examination of those subjects.</p>

<h3 id="e168">World Games Delegation Went to Nanjing Yesterday to Listen to Instructions. President Jiang Held a Flag-Giving Ceremony. <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>All Circles in This City Will Hold a Joint Farewell Today at the YMCA of China in Baxianqiao at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd. The Chinese delegation participating in this year's World Games was summoned by President Jiang and came to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 23rd to listen to instructions. The entire group of more than 80 people arrived at Hepingmen by train at 1:50 PM. Lei Zhen, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Education, and Hao Gengsheng and others went to the station to welcome them. They immediately took cars to visit the Mausoleum. Hao Gengsheng, the leader of the delegation, represented the delegation in presenting a wreath. They returned to the Lizi Society at 3:00 PM and attended President Jiang's tea party. At 4:00 PM, they listened to instructions in the society's auditorium and held a flag-giving ceremony. First, Director Wang gave a speech, followed by President Jiang's instructions, which were full of encouragement. Finally, President Jiang gave the flag, and the leader of the delegation, Hao Gengsheng, accepted it on behalf of the delegation. The Lizi Society Choir also sang to send off the delegation. The ceremony was simple and solemn. Then, they took photos. At 4:50 PM, the representatives took cars to visit the Xuanwu, Zhonghuamen, and other places in the Mausoleum. At 7:30 PM, President Jiang held a banquet at the Lizi Society, and the society held a concert to entertain the guests. The delegation will take the night express train to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e169">President Jiang's Instructions <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd. President Jiang summoned the athletes participating in the World Games and the members of the sports inspection team to Germany on the 23rd to give instructions. The main points of the instructions are as follows: He said that your visit to Germany to participate in the World Games is a representative of the new China. Your success or failure is related to the honor and disgrace of the country. I hope you will work hard and win glory for the motherland. Now, as you are about to leave, I would like to give you a few words of encouragement. I hope you will pay special attention to them. You should know that the central purpose of the World Games is to promote the true spirit of martial arts, that is, the spirit of "propriety, justice, integrity, and shame" advocated by the New Life Movement. Specifically, it is to respect morality, value public virtue, abide by discipline, pay attention to order, have courage and know the direction, and compete with propriety. The "sportsman's spirit" referred to in the West is to take its ability to maintain a spirit of honesty and love, abide by strict rules, and conduct peaceful and fair competitions. The meaning is also the same. Your participation in the World Games this time, the victory or defeat of the competition is not of great importance. The most important thing is to show the world the inherent spirit of propriety, justice, integrity, and shame of our country and nation. If morality is related to spiritual degeneration, then even if the competition is won, it is still a shame and a failure. If morality is not damaged and the spirit is noble, then even if the competition is lost, it is still glorious and victorious. Therefore, your participation in the World Games this time must win glory for our country in terms of moral spirit and discipline. All attitudes and actions must be based on morality, abide by regulations, be brave and know propriety, and only compete for virtue. At any time and in any place, you must show the demeanor of a dignified citizen of East Asia with a 5,000-year glorious history and a noble culture. Only then can you gain the respect and love of people from all countries in the world. I hope you will work hard and wish you health and triumph.</p>
<p>The delegation participating in the World Games, except for the football team that has already left the country and the cyclist who is far away in the Netherlands, took a special train to Nanjing yesterday to listen to instructions. After President Jiang personally gave the flag, they took the night train and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<p>All circles in this city, in view of the fact that our country's delegation will go to Germany to attend the World Games and promote national glory, have organized the Shanghai All Circles Farewell Meeting to the World Games Delegation. A joint meeting was held in the Municipal Government Auditorium and it was decided to hold a farewell ceremony at the YMCA of China in Baxianqiao at 4:00 PM today to express respect.</p>
<p>The National Sports Association received a letter from the Shanghai All Circles Farewell Meeting to the World Games Delegation, which stated: "Regarding the fact that your delegation is about to leave the country to participate in the World Games, all circles have specifically decided to hold a farewell meeting at the YMCA of China in Baxianqiao at 4:00 PM on June 24 to express respect. Therefore, we hereby inform you and hope that all your country's representatives and athletes will attend at that time. This is a special request. To the World Games Delegation, etc." All teams and athletes concentrated in Shanghai, as well as all members of the inspection team, are requested to attend on time to support the grand event of sports.</p>

<p>Municipal Sports Ground Women's Tennis Preliminary Round Chen Rongming, Zhu Tianzhen, and Others Win</p>
<p>The city-wide women's tennis open championship organized by the Municipal Sports Ground has already started yesterday. There were originally seven groups of competitions, but Zhao Jingfang, Chen Jinzhang, Liu Li, and others have already returned to their hometowns, Huang Zhifang could not participate due to illness, and Chen Rongsheng withdrew, so only four groups were played. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Based on yesterday's situation, the most promising players for the championship are Chen Rongming, Su Jianhua, and Mao Yuwen. Chen's strength lies in the power of her forehand and backhand shots. Su's tennis skills are quite good, but she has too many errors. Mao is more stable. The final will be very interesting. Su Mao and others were all on the court yesterday, but they only practiced because they did not meet their opponents. Su's tennis skills have improved more than in the past, so her hope for the championship is also strong.</p>

<p>Berlin, 23rd National News Agency: The 1936 International Olympic Games will be held here from August 1st to 16th. 53 countries are participating, with a total of over 6,000 athletes. This number is unprecedented in the history of the Olympic Games. The above figures were released by the Olympic Games Organizing Committee. Since the registration deadline of June 19th, the committee has been busy with the total count. However, these figures are still preliminary and can only broadly indicate which sports a country will participate in and the number of participants. The final figures will not be released until July 28th. It is currently known that Germany, the United States, and Italy will each participate in 23 sports, while France, England, and Italy will each participate in 19 sports. On the other hand, countries such as Costa Rica, Haiti, Jamaica, and Monaco will only participate in one sport. China will participate in nine sports, and Australia in eight sports. A portion of the Japanese team arrived in Berlin a few days ago and have begun training. The Australian men's team of 35 athletes and the women's team of 4 athletes arrived this morning.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd Havas News Agency: The Olympic Games are scheduled to open on August 1st, and athletes from all countries have set out for Germany. The Australian team, consisting of 35 male athletes and 3 female athletes, led by Captain Anderson, was the first to arrive this morning.

<h3 id="e177">Rong Qi-zhao and Li Hui-tang Discuss the Southern Expedition of the Soccer Team The Batavia Team is the Strongest <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Our country's World Games soccer team traveled south and was invincible. When they arrived in Medan, local reporters interviewed team leader Rong Qi-zhao and captain Li Hui-tang, who provided detailed accounts of the southern expedition. Excerpts from their conversation are as follows:</p>
<p>Rong Qi-zhao's Account: Question: "Your team has already played over ten matches on this southern expedition. From your observation, which team would you consider the most formidable?" Answer: "The most formidable teams, with strong and skilled players, are the Singapore Armed Forces Team and the Batavia Team. However, the strength of a team can only be determined after three or four matches. It is not accurate to draw conclusions based on a single victory or defeat." Question: "Which performance by your team on this southern expedition was the best?" Answer: "From my observation, the best performance was against the Batavia All-Stars. However, our team's purpose in playing against teams in various locations is to observe the skills of others, learn from their strengths, and compensate for our own weaknesses. It is also to train our players' combat abilities and prevent their skills from deteriorating. For this reason, during the matches, we rotated players who had not played, giving each player an opportunity to compete and improve their skills, as well as the overall team coordination."</p>
<p>Li Hui-tang's Account: Question: "Mr. Li, you are traveling to Southeast Asia again. How do you feel about the situation of overseas Chinese in various places, compared to what you saw on your previous two trips?" Answer: "Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia seem to be paying more attention to sports recently. During our team's southern expedition, overseas Chinese accounted for over 70% of the spectators at the matches we visited. This indicates that overseas Chinese are now emphasizing sports." Question: "From your observation, which team was the most formidable among the teams that the World Games team played against on this southern expedition?" Answer: "The Batavia Team is the strongest. However, it is difficult to assess their true strength based on just one or two matches." Question: "Which team's performance was the best among the teams the World Games team played against on this southern expedition?" Answer: "Regarding this, we dare not boast about which match was our best performance. However, our team's players have some quirks. In a match against a strong opponent, our players not only fight bravely, but also perform exceptionally well. If the opponent's strength is mediocre, our performance seems to be less energetic. In addition, the quality of the soccer field also affects our team's performance. Our team emphasizes coordination and uses a short-passing attack strategy. If the field is too hard, we sometimes find it difficult to control the bouncing ball. If the field is too soft, the ball moves slowly when passed." Question: "Which soccer field in Southeast Asia is the best?" Answer: "The Singapore field is the most suitable."</p>

<p>A Public Letter to Friends at Home</p>
<p>Time flies. It has been over a month since the soccer team stepped out of the country. We have been busy putting on our soccer boots and going out on the field, and I haven't been able to find time to report to my friends on the details of our trip. I am truly uneasy about this. If I could, I would be happy to write a long letter to each of my good friends, but there are so many good friends, and there is no way to do that.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would like to use the esteemed space in the newspaper to write this public letter. Although this public letter is not written for you individually, I hope that you will all treat it as a letter written specifically for you, and understand my sincere intentions. Indeed, when I write this public letter, the surprised faces of my friends are flowing in my mind, giving me infinite encouragement and joy.</p>
<p>When we left Shanghai and Hong Kong, we were deeply grateful to the friends who were able to come and see us off. It gave us, a group of pursuers with a vague future, a lot of comfort. The passionate emotions expressed on their faces still linger in my mind and are constantly replayed on my little screen. Since leaving the country until today, although the days have not been many, we have traveled a lot of miles. The distance traveled by ship, train, airplane, car, horse-drawn carriage, rickshaw, and on foot is quite amazing when added together. We have been to no less than twenty cities, including Saigon, Singapore, Batavia, Bandung, Surabaya, Malang, Semarang, Solo, and Medan. It is a pity that we were in a hurry and could only take a quick look, so we can't really talk about any incidents we observed. Our impressions are also very vague. The most obvious and easy to see is that the overseas Chinese have great expectations for us. This is a great comfort in the lonely journey, and it has increased our courage a lot.</p>
<p>Now, the battle in Southeast Asia is mostly over. After Medan, we will go to Penang and India for performances. On July 9th, we will gather with all the athletes participating in the World Games in Bombay and set off for Europe. I will talk about what happens next when I have time. At the same time, I hope my friends will not be stingy with their advice and will give me some guidance within the realm possible (please send it to Berlin).</p>
<p>Finally, I can reassure you all that, thanks to the efforts of the Great Alliance, we have only drawn once and have not lost in the fifteen battles we have fought so far. Just imagine that in the hot weather of Southeast Asia, with a tight schedule, unfavorable terrain, and the hardships of traveling and fighting across thousands of miles, we have been able to achieve such excellent results. Isn't that great? Below is a grand review of our achievements. I am afraid that soccer fans across the country, apart from you, will also be happy to see it first. Please do, and I wish you all progress and a happy summer! Hui-tang, June 9th, Medan</p>

<h3 id="e179">Oil Market: May Tung Oil Export Situation <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>According to the report of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, the amount of tung oil exported in May that passed inspection and was approved for export was 7,578.63 metric tons, a decrease of over 11,000 metric tons compared to the 18,583.92 metric tons in the same month last year. At first glance, it seems that tung oil exports are in a state of sharp decline. However, looking at the total amount for the first five months of this year, this year still exceeds last year by about 5,000 metric tons. This shows that the decline in export figures in May does not seem to be a sign of trade decline. In recent months, the tung oil market has been brisk and prices have been firm, which is rare in history. Although the Italo-Ethiopian War has ended and domestic and foreign tung oil prices have changed slightly, the market atmosphere is still quite stable. In addition, there is a shortage of spot goods in Shanghai and Hankou, and holders are generally holding on to their goods and expecting prices to rise, resulting in quieter transactions and a sharp reduction in export volume. As for domestic sales, the market in May was also quieter. Domestic circulation was 215.72 metric tons, compared to 317.98 metric tons at the same time last year.

<p>Xin Feng Yang Bank reported that yesterday (the 22nd), the New York stock market rose to a new high since April 15th.

According to speculators, the company's second-quarter earnings should be around 4 yuan, of which 2 yuan will be dividends. Stocks on the Small Exchange rose slightly.

Therefore, there were no market reports for "Gold Standard, Foreign Exchange, Securities, Yarn and Cotton, Flour and Wheat, Miscellaneous Grains, Oil Cakes, Silk and Tea, and the North-South Rice Market."

<p>"爭" (zhēng), "to compete," means to vie for, to invade. "掙" (zhèng), "to struggle," means to strive for liberation. The former is the action of the strong, the latter is the manifestation of the weak's resistance. However, "爭" is a habit that the strong are unwilling to give up even on their deathbeds. "掙" is not necessarily something that everyone can use—because there are many weak people who, when they see the strong coming to annex them, give in at once!</p>
<p>If the strong abandon "爭," the world will immediately be at peace. If the weak abandon "掙," not only will there be no peace, but it will only promote the growth of war! Facts tell us: "'爭' will not disappear." Then the group of the weak should march in unison, unite their front, and desperately "掙"! While there is still breath, this ambition must not be relaxed even slightly. Even if they perish from struggling, it is glorious, and there are many more weak people who continue to struggle!</p>
<p>Brutal strong people! You must not take "爭" as the precious raft to prolong your life. You must know that the weak will awaken fiercely. They will awaken that "掙" is the only tool for them to preserve their lives! They want to realize their hopes under "掙." Beware! The result of that kind of "爭" cannot resist this "掙"!</p>

<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>Following my friend, I came out of the cinema and strolled into a nearby coffee shop. A waitress, only eighteen or nineteen years old, with a round face, although not beautiful, but not repulsive, skillfully greeted us and seated us. From the corners of her mouth, which were covered with thick powder and rouge, a shallow dimple emerged, and she gently placed a small notepad with a pencil attached in front of my friend. From her crimson lips, a sentence flowed out, "You haven't been here for a week."</p>
<p>"That's right," my friend nodded, then said, "Two coffees with milk. If you're free, get yourself one too." The waitress nodded, twisted her waist, and went to the back room. Before long, she brought three cups of steaming milk, placed them on the small round table, and sat down next to my friend. While stirring the milk, she quietly asked my friend, "Is that short-lived Xiao Lu still in Shanghai?" My friend shook her head and said, "Forget it, do you still need to be so serious with him?" The waitress lowered her eyes and said firmly, "One day, when I find him, I will definitely settle the accounts of this past year with him."</p>
<p>"Alright, everything will be on my account," my friend said with a playful smile, breaking the depressing atmosphere. I couldn't help but laugh, which made the waitress laugh too. While laughing, she glared at my friend, but my friend pretended not to see it and solemnly repeated, "Everything will be on my account, alright."</p>
<p>Under the soft dark green light, we sat for nearly forty minutes, listening to the waitress recount her romance with Xiao Lu. In a scene filled with two bags of tears and gritted teeth, my friend left two dollars, put on her hat, and pulled me out of the coffee shop. On the dusk-lit street, she took a deep breath, tossed away a rubber-tipped cigarette butt, and said, "Old brother, are you interested in settling this karmic debt for Xiao Lu?"</p>
<p>"I obey your command, but I don't know if it will be on your account?" I said, and we both laughed at each other.</p>
<p>In a sound of good night, I went home with staggered steps. But from that day on, I don't know why, I seemed to have one more worry.</p>

<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>The "Standard Husband" is a new neighbor of mine, a title respectfully bestowed upon him by several ladies in our shikumen neighborhood.</p>
<p>Speaking of this Standard Husband, he truly lives up to the name. He works in a foreign firm, is around thirty-five years old, has no children, and no maids. The entire household consists of just him and his wife. His wife is a large woman, weighing at least one hundred and sixty pounds. The couple's love is extremely deep.</p>
<p>This Standard Husband always gets up at dawn. The first things he does after getting up are wiping the windows, sweeping the floor, and washing the teacups. After finishing these tasks, he goes to buy groceries with a basket. Generally, before eight o'clock, he returns home with a basket of groceries. At the same time, he always buys some breakfast to bring back. He eats half of the breakfast and leaves the other half for his wife. After eating breakfast, he busies himself with scaling fish or cutting meat, followed by washing vegetables and rinsing rice. If the weather is clear, he even has to steal a moment to hang several bamboo poles of clothes to dry. It's not until eight forty-five that he puts on his hat and goes to work.</p>
<p>His wife, regardless of the weather, always gets up at ten o'clock. After washing up and having a light breakfast, she goes downstairs to cook rice. By the time it's a quarter past twelve, the rice is cooked, and the husband returns. Then, she goes back to her room to rest, and her husband prepares the dishes. Bringing the food upstairs, serving the rice, washing the bowls, and other tasks are all the Standard Husband's job. After lunch, the Standard Husband takes care of things briefly and then goes back to work. His wife goes downstairs to play mahjong. (If there's no mahjong game, she closes the door and takes a nap.) Needless to say, the serving of dinner is also the Standard Husband's responsibility.</p>
<p>Saturday afternoon is the Standard Husband's floor-washing day. In two hours, he can scrub and wash the floor spotlessly clean.</p>
<p>This Standard Husband resolutely shoulders all the heavy household responsibilities himself, truly making him one of a kind. Except for emptying the chamber pot and washing clothes, which are handled by a maid from another family, he does everything himself. His wife simply sleeps and plays mahjong every day, living a very carefree life. Therefore, several ladies in the neighborhood all feel a sense of regret at not having met him before getting married, and they envy the Standard Husband's wife for having such great fortune.</p>
<p>However, people are always unsatisfied. In the ladies' casual conversations, she always reveals that her husband also has his shortcomings. Although he is willing to do things, he just doesn't earn a lot of money.</p>

<p>— (Lan Shan)</p>
<p>The other morning, around seven o'clock, a police van that also catches beggars stopped at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Old Race Course Road. Several Chinese and foreign detectives got out of the car and entered several private brothels that specialize in catering to foreign soldiers, to arrest people. These prostitutes were just in the middle of their sweet dreams when they were grabbed from their beds, their hair disheveled, their faces lonely, their clothes unkempt, and their eyes drowsy. When they saw the police officers, who looked like wolves and tigers, they were scared out of their wits. Some, with little courage, cried tears profusely. Some, with enough guts, looked for an opportunity to run away. But in the end, it was like catching turtles in a jar, easily done. In less than half an hour, they had already "loaded a car full." At that time, the author was moved by the scene and wrote a poem lamenting: "Seven o'clock in the morning, the police van arrives; inside Gengfu Lane, chickens fly everywhere in chaos."</p>
<p>It is said that after they are arrested, they are transferred from the police station to the court. If it is proven that they do not wish to pursue this carnal life, they can be sent to charitable organizations to live. If they voluntarily engage in prostitution, they are fined and released according to the situation. But strangely, none of them were forced into prostitution; ninety-nine percent said they were willing. Because they know that charitable organizations are not as good as brothels in terms of clothing, entertainment, and food.</p>
<p>After they are released, they will soon be arrested and fined again. -- It is said that they will be fined until they are afraid and change their profession. -- What a good solution! Excellent!</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Three: Gentle Rain and Slanting Wind Leave Traces; Deep Night, Silent Person Writes a Letter of Severance</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Zhang said: This is about today. These past few days, I've seen you sitting in your study, just sitting and brooding, and I don't know what's wrong. Guoqi smiled: You are just too loving of your son, thinking too much about everything; there's really nothing. Old Mrs. Zhang said: As long as there's nothing wrong with you, that's good. Would I want you to have something on your mind? After dinner, Guoqi didn't dare go out again and stayed in his study to read. However, after reading three or five pages, he started daydreaming again. His mother's question today was not without reason. He's been making good progress these past few days. Yesterday, during their last meeting, when he was holding his hat, the other person looked at him and even nodded in acknowledgement. If this continues, he can talk to him. Originally, they've known each other to this extent, yet he still doesn't know the other person's name. That's really not right. He must speak to him every time he sees him from now on. What should he say as the first sentence? I'll start according to Western customs: "Miss, may I ask your surname?" But what if he doesn't agree? Or simply won't? Because they've known each other for about a month, he already knows that I'm Zhang Litian. He has seen him holding magazines several times, and those magazines all contain my writing. On this point, it proves that they are literary acquaintances. If we're literary acquaintances, why can't we exchange names? He is willing to read my writing, so he definitely won't refuse my question. I'll take a risk. What's there to be afraid of? In any case, he can't ignore me. Thinking to this point, it's as if a difficult math problem has been solved, and he reaches out to slap the table. But after the sound, he immediately realizes that this noise shouldn't be heard by his mother. He immediately calms down and looks at a book in front of him. Fortunately, his mother didn't hear the noise, and it passed without incident. The next day, when he woke up, it was already drizzling. The alleys were muddy, as if it had been raining all night. In this kind of weather, the young ladies probably wouldn't be willing to get wet going to school. Even if they do go to school, they'll take a car, how could they walk? It would be pointless to take a detour today to meet him. He could also not go at all. But in order to maintain his own faithfulness, even if he doesn't meet him, he must take this detour, so that if he still comes to school, he won't miss him. With this thought, Guoqi went out with an umbrella in the rain, walking slowly, looking around in those narrow alleys. But after he had walked through all those narrow alleys, the rain was falling diagonally like a net of threads. He suddenly smiled to himself. This is really too faithful of me. If I were a female student, I wouldn't come out in such heavy rain. Thinking to himself, a gust of wind came, and the umbrella couldn't hold on, splashing his face with rain. He started walking faster, about to go to school. Unexpectedly, at the turn in the road, under the gate of a large house, there was already a small umbrella extending from under the eaves. (39)</p>

<h3 id="e190">The Dark Side of Japanese Tourist Guides <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>Visiting the three islands of Japan is just a matter of seeing a few shrines and a few hot springs. But with effective publicity and tall tales, naturally Westerners come from thousands of miles away to sightsee and experience Eastern flavors. The profits from tourism in the spring and autumn seasons are very prosperous, so the special agencies of the Japan Tourism Bureau are permanently thriving. Westerners who visit Japan must hire guides, whom the Japanese call "案内" (annai). This special profession is mostly filled by hotel waiters and rickshaw pullers, with about two hundred people nationwide. There are many dark secrets involved, such as taking foreigners to prostitutes or cheating them out of money when buying antiques. Chinese who come to Japan for sightseeing are mostly led by students studying abroad and do not need "annai." Moreover, they can't fool the Chinese with a few Chinese characters, so they don't like guiding Chinese people.</p>
<p>There is an "Annai" association in Yokohama, where each member has to contribute two or three thousand yuan of capital. There are no vacancies, which shows that this profession is very lucrative. They accompany tourists in turn according to their numbers, but tourists can also specify who they want to hire. Their daily income is about seven to ten yuan, but tourist ships only come and go for about four months a year. The rest of the time, they have to do other business or live off their savings. Therefore, most of them also deal in antiques, and their wives open unique secret hotels in Yokohama.</p>
<p>Guides spend the whole day with foreigners, eating Western food and riding in cars, living a very comfortable life. Even if they stay in a three-yuan room in a hotel, they can earn one yuan back. So, all hotels that cater to tourists are in cahoots with them, otherwise, even the Imperial Hotel would have to close down. Not to mention hotels, they also have secret commissions on other purchases and geishas playing the shamisen. Moreover, foreigners who come to Japan for sightseeing are all rich, and a few thousand yuan is not a big deal. Once, an American woman bought an earthenware pot for thirty yuan in a village in Nikko, and the guide got one-third of the money. Another time, an American tycoon saw an ancient Buddha in an antique store in Yokohama, but the deal didn't go through. The guide spoke eloquently, insisting that it was from the Kamakura period and that there were only three in all of Japan, except for Yokohama, Kyoto, and Nikko. Later, he led him to an antique store in Nikko, where they found the same statue, with even better gold plating than the one in Yokohama. He bought it for six thousand yuan. In fact, the ancient Buddha in Yokohama had already taken the train to Nikko at the request of the guide, waiting for him there. Japanese antiques often circulate in Kobe and Nagasaki, all waiting for tourists to come.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, the geisha Yuki-musume of Gion in Kyoto became Mrs. Malga once and earned tens of thousands of yuan. There are even more prostitutes, courtesans, and geishas in Tokyo who have made fortunes by gaining the favor of foreigners. Girls from the countryside are often introduced by guides to be temporary partners of tourists. As long as there is money, they can be bought and sold at a price. This may be why foreigners are so fond of Japan. There are also those who become foreign women's gigolos through guides, such as Matsumoto, who traveled around Japan with an Italian middle-aged woman for three months, like a couple. After they parted, he used his savings to open a furniture store in Yokohama. There was also an old woman from New Gold Mountain who died of illness while sightseeing in Japan and gave all her savings in the Yokohama Specie Bank to the guide, instructing him to transport her bones back to her hometown, which was an unexpected windfall.</p>
<p>There are also a dozen female guides, who have lived in France or the United States for many years and speak fluent foreign languages. They also have considerable experience in socializing and cohabiting with foreigners. They wear gorgeous clothes and are more modern than dance girls. In the hotels of Hakone, Nikko, and Atami, they accompany tourists in and out. Who would recognize them as Japanese? Recently, the Tourism Bureau has been considering using female guides, but that is another matter. (Translated from "Talk" magazine, April issue, page 323)</p>

<h3 id="e191">Song of Moods <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Liang Qiyun</p>
<p>I was raised with this kind of education from a young age. — When I was little, if I ever mixed with the cowherds or the children of the tenant farmers to play, my grandmother would forcefully drag me home and say to me in a stern and threatening tone, "I've told you a thousand times, ten thousand times, to not mix with them, but you just won't listen. When you grow up, I'll make you a farmer who steps in cow dung and mud."</p>
<p>Then, in my free time or before going to bed, I would clamor for stories. My grandmother often painted pictures of the luxurious lives of people like Uncle Yongquan and Second Master Dingxiang (the big landlords in my hometown).</p>
<p>In my young heart, these left a slight impression that persists to this day:</p>
<p>...Holding a dry tobacco pipe, dressed neatly, strolling leisurely and comfortably on the embankment. As soon as the tenant farmers saw them, they would rush forward to greet them and ask how they were doing. And they had huge rice granaries at home, several wives, and were creditors to many families in the village...</p>
<p>And I myself, without knowing why, gradually envied this kind of life. Towards those who struggled in the vortex of life, especially the boatmen who pulled ropes, the farmers who plowed and planted rice, and the rickshaw pullers, I had a sense of contempt and disdain. As for why I did this, I didn't have a good reason to explain it clearly.</p>
<p>Later, I learned some new and pretty words, and for those people who, in a disguised form, used their labor for food, I called them "slaves of life"!</p>
<p>I had a cousin who got a bachelor's degree from the University of Hong Kong. Once, when I met him in Shanghai, I heard him often use "lowly, despicable things" as a curse. I also imitated him, and whenever those so-called slaves of life angered me, I would curse, "Lowly, despicable things."</p>
<p>My grandmother and uncles all praised me for "having backbone" and "making progress."</p>
<p>Time increased my age.</p>
<p>It's really strange; I don't know when I caught a difficult-to-cure disease. When I was alone, thinking or reading something, my heart would become troubled. It was as if, in a gloomy sky, the surrounding black clouds were all gathered in one place. At the same time, it was as if my heart had become a stubborn stone, unable to be broken with a knife or chopped with an axe.</p>
<p>Every year at the end of the year or during festivals, I would see my father stomp home, sighing towards the dark sky, even turning green in the face and collapsing in a chair... and,</p>
<p>Year after year, I always received too many unsatisfactory events. I watched hope vanish one by one like bubbles. I was depressed, frustrated, and resentful. Fate was like a devil to me, cunning, sly, and very cruel. I was angry! - Although those unsatisfactory things were caused by too many dreams! During the day, I cursed it; (bad luck, bad luck that made my family decline day by day). I cursed it at night too. But the more I did this, the devil seemed to stalk me like a ghost. Before I knew it, it would invade my body again. I tried again and again to get rid of the devil, but it wasn't that simple. Bad luck always hindered the arrival of good dreams and mercilessly occupied me entirely, whether in spring, summer, or autumn...</p>
<p>In this way, I couldn't help but feel troubled and terrified about everything. — A universal feeling of trouble and terror towards every tiny thing.</p>
<p>I felt that my mood had changed.</p>
<p>I was now tired of the things I had previously envied, hating them as if I were smelling a rotten odor on them. Towards the so-called slaves of life that I had previously despised, I instead increased a sense of sympathy.</p>
<p>Whenever I looked in the mirror, gently stroking my haggard cheeks, I couldn't help but sigh. -</p>
<p>"Tomorrow, ah, tomorrow, what kind of day will it be"!</p>
<h3 id="e192">Shopkeeper Guo <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Heng</p>
<p>Shopkeeper Guo's shop hadn't had business for a long time. Although buyers still kept coming in every day, most of them just asked about the price and walked out with a cold laugh, without looking back. One day, two days, one month, two months, it was always like this, and Shopkeeper Guo couldn't stand it anymore. He gritted his teeth and said to the shop assistant,</p>
<p>"Let's go for it, lower the price again!"</p>
<p>"But, Shopkeeper Guo, we're not even making a penny of profit on our goods anymore. The coarse goods are already discounted by 5%, doing this is simply..." The shop assistant and accountant, Wang Dali, said to him, but later, seeing Shopkeeper Guo's pale face, he didn't have the courage to continue. In fact, Shopkeeper Guo understood all of this in his heart. He knew that the price of his shop's goods couldn't be lowered anymore. Even selling them at this price was at a loss. But rather than leaving them on the shelves, it was better to sell them at a loss.</p>
<p>"Lower it again, discount it by 20% off the original price!" he said to the shop assistant, his face even paler and his teeth clenched even tighter. This time, Wang Dali didn't say anything, just stared at Shopkeeper Guo's bloodless face. He knew that what the shopkeeper was doing was simply ruining himself. But what could he do? Other shops were mostly selling untaxed goods, and their costs were half as much as his. If he didn't lower the price again, he would only be able to keep them on the shelves forever. He knew the shopkeeper's difficulties, and he also knew that even like this, he couldn't compete with other shops. But! But, he stopped thinking. In the distance, there was endless darkness.</p>
<p>"Let's take a chance"! His final conclusion.</p>
<p>That night, they worked all night, re-pricing the goods. The next morning, as soon as it was light, Wang Dali put up the written colored-paper low-price advertisements, "Selling at a loss, low-price liquidation!" Shopkeeper Guo paced back and forth outside the counter, sometimes looking outside the door. A truck carrying goods of various kinds was passing in front of them, and two XX people were following behind the truck, driving straight to the gate of the Tiantai shop diagonally opposite.</p>
<p>"Smuggled goods"! It was like two bombs exploding in front of his eyes. He took a step back unconsciously, leaning on the counter inside the door.</p>
<p>"What's wrong"? Wang Dali dropped the goods he was sorting and ran over to support him. He shook his hand, indicating that he was fine, while struggling to sit up. In his heart, he clearly realized that his shop was "finished"!</p>
<p>"Ten years of hard work ah"! He gently spat out these words.</p>
<p>"Shopkeeper Guo," Wang Dali walked to his side and said in a low voice. "Things have already come to this, there's no use being sad. Who could have expected the foreign smuggled goods to come so fiercely? But it's not just our shop that's affected in the market: Hongsheng, Yuanli, Yongfengtai, which one isn't like this? Of course, their owners are strong and still have a good reputation in the market, but small shops like ours can't stand it. But," he lowered his voice even more, pointing at the shop diagonally opposite the door, "why don't we do the same? There are several foreign firms in Tianjin. As long as you pay half in cash and find a shop guarantor, you can pick up the goods. There are still two hundred yuan in cash in the till now. Don't pay the rent for this month first. The loan from Yonghe Bank has already been delayed for two months. If you talk nicely and add the interest for this month, and postpone the repayment of the principal for another month, you can use this cash to buy a batch of goods from Tianjin, as long as..." Before he could finish speaking, he was interrupted by Shopkeeper Guo.</p>
<p>"I've thought about this too. It's easy to deal with the landlord, but Yonghe Bank is probably not easy to pester, but we have no choice but to do this. Let's take a chance"! The matter was decided like this. Wang Dali took all the cash and went to Tianjin by car. Shopkeeper Guo stayed alone in the shop. He rewrote the advertisement to "Half-price liquidation!"</p>
<p>Sure enough, there were more buyers, and Shopkeeper Guo was busy alone. Watching the goods on the shelves decrease day by day, he felt an unspeakable ease in his heart, but this ease was also mixed with bitter juice.</p>
<p>One day, two days, three days, Wang Dali hadn't returned yet, and Shopkeeper Guo became anxious. He suspected that he had run away with the money. But thinking about it, Wang Dali wouldn't be that kind of person. They had been shop partners for seven years.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, he received news that it was because Wang Dali had ordered too few goods, and the foreigners were unwilling to deliver them. He was caught by customs officers while smuggling them in from the main road.</p>
<p>In the evening, Shopkeeper Guo's shop closed its doors especially early. The next day, it didn't open again. It wasn't until the third day that someone found him hanging straight from the beam.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Yellow Peel (Continued from Yesterday) <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Chou Tong</p>
<p>"I'm afraid they're going to build a car road here! They've put up stakes all over the garden and the house!"</p>
<p>Black Bone Two's heart sank as if it had fallen into a pit. His mouth trembled, and he didn't know how to ask: "Car road — um, what are you talking about?"</p>
<p>The son glanced at his father and then said: "Everyone says that those stakes bring misfortune, not good fortune. Huang Debiao from the yamen also told me that they're going to build it. Back then, when they built the car road at the end, they also put up these kinds of stakes first. The land where the stakes are put up will be seized to build the car road, and even the graves will be dug up —"</p>
<p>Black Bone Two groaned, coughing. He coughed until his face was red. He stroked his chest and asked his son, panting:</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>"They'll take it by force?"</p>
<p>"If they don't take it by force, who's going to be friendly with you!" The son said: "If it's really like that... hum, depending on them is not reliable!" He shook his head.</p>
<p>Black Bone Two groaned as if he had been hit by a hammer in the dark. He trembled and said: "Maybe they won't build a car road..."</p>
<p>He wanted to find some comfort from his son's face, but his son's face was so gloomy, like the twilight of the "plum rain season." He couldn't find any comfort at all.</p>
<p>Black Bone Two groaned for a while, turned his eyes towards the door, and cluelessly packed a pipe of tobacco. The dry tobacco flashed red and black in the dark. It was like a light of hope flashing before his eyes.</p>
<p>"I can ask for a high price, so the yamen can't afford it," he calculated a very high price. He wanted to ask for a price that would scare the yamen. "I'll ask for a price of ten thousand strings of cash!"</p>
<p>So he was happy. "Who would be willing to spend ten thousand strings of cash to buy these two old houses and dozens of yellow peel trees?..." Thinking of this, he smiled slightly, forgetting about the road construction and sitting outside the door to smoke, just like he did every evening.</p>
<p>"If you don't have money, you're giving it to the public!" Finally, in the early summer when the yellow peel flowers bloomed, Black Bone Two's hope was shattered by this iron-like voice. Two very wide lines of lime, from south to north, decided his future life and fate.</p>
<p>When they started building the road, Black Bone Two's heart ached like it was being cut. Watching the house and garden that had been passed down from his ancestors, not sold because of his own lack of success, but taken over by the car road... he cried and shouted day and night. He told the passersby. He looked completely like a madman.</p>
<p>Now, the yellow peel is bearing fruit again. In the yellow peel gardens of the nearby houses, each tree is filled with clusters of yellow peel, flashing proud, yet innocent smiles in the evening sunset. A gust of wind swept past, and the branches swayed. Clusters of yellow peel, crowded together, like tens of thousands of people moving in a grand gathering place.</p>
<p>Black Bone Two watched, remembering his former yellow peel garden. - That's right, at this time of year in the past, there could be good income, how could it be like now, with no morning or evening? He held the pipe under his arm, scratched his gray and messy hair, and sighed. He straightened his body.</p>
<p>His eyes were already failing, and the twilight made it worse. Looking at the clusters of yellow peel in front of him, they suddenly turned into countless gold, flowing, shining with a bright light, luring him. At this time, he really wished he could grab it with one hand and hold it in his arms! Even if the gold crushed him to death, he would be willing. However, as soon as his eyes blinked, the countless gold turned back into yellow peel.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Cold Water Bath (1) <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Er He</p>
<p>I grew up in the countryside, and as a child, I was extremely fond of cold water baths. It wasn't until I mingled in the city that I learned about swimming. But what's the difference between swimming and cold water baths? Swimming is a fashionable name in the city, while cold water bath is a simple and rustic name in the countryside. Swimming is envied by everyone in the city, and a modern man or woman who doesn't know how to swim is considered unqualified. However, cold water baths in the countryside don't attract much attention from adults. They think it's only something for people who catch fish and crabs. Why would someone who doesn't catch fish and crabs take a cold water bath? Therefore, wealthy children are often prevented by adults from having the opportunity to take cold water baths. But poor children's parents are a bit more lenient with their lives. They also have the opportunity to take cold water baths for convenience in making a living (they can catch fish and crabs in the water in the summer to earn money). However, children's personalities are the same after all. Even wealthy children always yearn for cold water baths. Therefore, the more stubborn and brave ones learn to take cold water baths in this situation. However, adults always say:</p>
<p>"This child, instead of studying and acting like an adult, is soaking in the water all day doing something useless!"</p>
<p>But the children insist on bathing. Isn't this passion probably the same as city dwellers' passion for swimming? When I was a child, I was happiest taking cold water baths. But I was an only child, and my parents often kept me from playing near the ditches. But I would secretly go whenever I had the chance. Because of this, my parents, who loved me very much, would reluctantly hit me a few times, thinking that it would make me a well-behaved child. But I would still sneak to the ditches to watch the other children take cold water baths, trying to figure out their tricks so that I could float and sink as freely as they did.</p>

<p>Opening: "Ode to the Red Cliff"</p>
<p>Romantic scholar in Huangzhou. Every day, he enjoys himself by the river. On the sixteenth day of the ninth month in the renxu year, he meets two or three close friends and talks. They elegantly ascend the Red Cliff boat together. Soon, the moon rises from the eastern mountain. Leaning on the railing, they gaze at the Dipper constellation. They strike the strings and clap the beat, singing of the bright moon. They frequently fill their cups with Li Bai's wine. One song, one drink. The guest harmonizes with the xiao flute, the sound and rhythm are deep. The guest is Yang Daoshi from Western Sichuan, blowing a fluttering sound and a lingering rhythm. It's as if a widow is weeping in a solitary boat. One can sigh at Cao Mengde, who composed poetry and brandished his spear in leisurely pleasure. He defeated Jingzhou and flowed smoothly for a thousand miles. He was indeed a hero of his time. I don't know where he is now. Thirty-six thousand days pass easily. How fortunate is life as a mayfly? One must see through empty fame and fortune. Talking about poverty and success embarrasses me. Wash the cups and drink. Gather the dishes. The scattered cups are not free. They pillow each other on the boat.</p>

<p>Gusts of west wind blow across the east. Meeting an old fisherman at the bridgehead. He often provides three meals a day. The young scholar is diligently studying. Suddenly, three knocks are heard on the brushwood gate. Torches and lanterns are visible, layer upon layer. The servants and maids have all dispersed. Only the beautiful girl remains. Could it be that classmates have come to tease? Could it be that demons from the mountain have appeared? Miss listens, call husband. Certainly no fleeting love. This slave is not an unknown woman. Her father is called Ma in the court. He coveted wealth and offered the slave to Madam Liang as the Western Palace. The slave is unwilling to follow the traitor. Therefore, I composed a poem on the wall. It was cleverly seen by my father, who was furious. But see the added couplet: "Fame and wealth will come naturally," and the second couplet: "Wealth will eventually turn poor." He dispatched the chief steward to search and capture. He clearly offered me to the young scholar. Jian Sheng listens, his face flushed. He thinks that a thousand pieces of gold are not worth a difficult prison. He thinks that Miss lives in a high hall at home, while the young scholar's walls are collapsing and the roof is leaking. Miss is served by servants and maids at home, while the young scholar is accompanied by a lonely lamp in his room. Miss eats delicacies from land and sea at home, while the young scholar often has empty meals three times a day. Miss wears silk and satin at home, while the young scholar bares his shoulders and chest. He advises the young woman to return home early, so as not to suffer here. Miss listens, with tears in her eyes, waiting to die and return to nothingness, to avoid others gossiping. They are in difficulty when the old fisherman who delivers charcoal in the snow arrives. Act as a matchmaker.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Talking with Mr. Chen Chuanlin about Photography <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>—Joint Photography Exhibition by Chen and Lu</p>
<p>The second joint photography exhibition by Mr. Chen Chuanlin and Mr. Lu Shifu has begun at Daxin Company on the fourth floor, with hours from 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Regarding the works in this exhibition, I am an amateur in photography art and am not in a position to make any comments. Besides, everyone has different preferences, so the best way is to let photography art enthusiasts see for themselves. As for what is recorded here, it is some conversations about photography that I had with Mr. Chen Chuanlin at the venue.</p>
<p>Among Mr. Chen's works, I think what is commendable is his ode to modern architecture and his regularity of folk life. Although there are also things like "a single oar sound in the landscape" in his works, generally speaking, this tendency is rare.</p>
<p>Every great artist is definitely not giving idlers something to rely on, taking pictures for them to put in the study and living room as decorations. He is standing on the new line of the times, facing the pain of the people, to call for injustice for them. In the current situation where the country is in dire straits, with the patriotic movement in full swing, he should also use his camera to record the real situation. Regarding this point, Mr. Chen said: "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country. We are very willing to do it, but because most of the current photography enthusiasts are amateurs, due to professional constraints, it is difficult to have the opportunity to join in the fun. Even when thinking of going to the countryside to collect some photography materials, it often goes against expectations and is not easy to achieve. Therefore, as it stands, we can only have this wish: to take more photos related to the country and society. As for whether we can do it, that can only depend on whether there is an opportunity."</p>
<p>After that, he led me through their exhibition works, regarding his own works, he cited two works as examples to illustrate how he photographed them.</p>
<p>The first work is number 89 "Deep in the Green Hills," which is a picture taken using top light. He said that usually, we all know that top light is the least suitable light for photography, but there are also exceptions, such as this one, I used top light to take it, because usually, the background behind the mountain always has light, only at noon, the mountain is all black, this thing of mine is to use this opportunity to take.</p>
<h3 id="e200">"Bright Moon Mystery" <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing Screen</p>
<p>The second is number 73 photo, is a lot of chickens of different sizes pecking at food very able loving spirit, according to Mr. Chen, when taking this thing, I put a lot of thought into the angle, because if it is taken flat, it will definitely feel very flat visually, and if it is taken from above, the chickens will definitely be very scattered, after considering the results, I used a 45-degree oblique angle to complete it, the result of washing it out, although I dare not say how good it is, but I feel very satisfied with myself.</p>
<p>Later we also talked about some other things, but to save space, I will omit them.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Yihua Wins Lianhua <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>

<p>Yihua colleagues pay great attention to amateur sports, and have organized basketball, volleyball, football and other teams, and they are very active and powerful. A few days ago, the football team played a friendly match with the Lianhua Company football team at the Fudan High School pitch, and most of the female stars from both companies came to cheer them on. As a result, Yihua won with a score of five to one.</p>

<h3 id="e202">New Information on the India-Australia "General" Branch Plant <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>General Motors of America is one of the largest automobile manufacturers in the world, with huge capital and numerous products. No one denies this. Their headquarters are in the United States, but the cars they manufacture travel all over the world. This is not to mention that, apart from the main factory in the New World, there are quite a few branch factories and shops around the globe. Therefore, it is not meaningless flattery for some people to call them "Universal".</p>
<p>Some of the branch factories set up by General Motors in various places are very large in scale, and the annual turnover is also very considerable. Their goal in setting up branch factories is not only to enable local buyers to obtain lower prices due to the reduction of import taxes and the utilization of local raw materials, but also to employ local workers as much as possible, so that both labor and capital benefit mutually. Now, let's record one of their many factories, General Motors India Limited, and the planned new Australian factory, to get a glimpse.</p>
<p>In India, in recent years, many people feel that there should be an automobile manufacturing company. Although the unfortunate experience of the Calcutta company, this need has not diminished. General (India) Co., Ltd. can be said to be a powerful organization that has emerged in response to this need. The General plant is located in the place of Hughli. They feel very happy to be able to find various talents, workers, etc. in machinery and office work locally. Looking at the numbers below, we can regard this as a powerful proof that is beneficial to India. In the General plant, 97% of the employees are native Indians. In 1935, the company's expenses reached 38,000,000 rupees.</p>
<p>The establishment of factories by General Motors in the local area not only solved the employment problem of Indians, but also brought many benefits to buyers. In the past, a complete car was transported into India fully assembled. The cost of raw materials, labor, and transportation taxes was higher than that of assembling it locally. Therefore, according to General Motors' estimates, the money saved by buyers has reached 12,000,000 rupees.</p>
<p>General Motors' operating statistics for 1935 are as follows:</p>
<p>In order to develop the automobile industry in various places abroad, General Motors often establishes new factories as needed. Recently, General Motors CEO Hanert said, "We firmly believe in Australia's future prosperity and have prepared to build a very large new factory on the banks of the Yarra River in Melbourne." It is said that the area of this new General factory is one of the largest in Australia. The construction of the factory building is expected to be completed in six months, and the number of employees will be approximately 1,500,000. The total cost will reach 400,000 pounds. Hanert has already ordered a large amount of building materials from a steel plant in Australia, and the number of these orders is very large.</p>
<p>The main workshop of the new Australian factory has an area of ​​920 feet by 360 feet, and the total location is 331,200 feet. The material handling machines used in the factory buildings, both overhead and flat types, are widely used. The installation of the testing machine is even more novel. Various road vehicle tests can be carried out on a set of rotating shaft machines. In addition, there is a testing cave with a width of 80 feet, where the final step of testing various vehicles is carried out.</p>
<p>Most of the machines installed in the factory are very new, and some are seen for the first time in Australia. Among them, the car body painting engineering department uses the new principle of air conditioning. After the car body has undergone layer-by-layer painting, it is baked accordingly.</p>

<p>American Automobile Production Statistics According to the American "Automobile Daily News", the registration statistics of passenger car production in the spring of this year (except for the numbers of one state and one month that have not been listed) are as follows: In 1936, Chevrolet ranked first with 198,153 vehicles.

Chrysler ranked tenth with 10,941 vehicles. Paka ranked eleventh with 9,714 vehicles. Nash Rafayette ranked twelfth with 7,553 vehicles. The comparison with the same period in 1935 is Ford 197,757 vehicles. Chevrolet 107,729. Plymouth 83,122. Dodge 36,144. Baotaike 27,002. Walter Smobile 26,807. Hert Tura Ping 14,735. Buick 12,818.

<p>Suggestion for Coloring the Speedometer The green, yellow and red lights commonly used in traffic management in major cities around the world are widely used for vehicle traffic safety. It is now proposed to use these three colors on the car speedometer as well. So that drivers can pay attention at any time when the car speed increases. The colored speedometer is green from zero to thirty miles per hour. Yellow from thirty miles to fifty miles per hour. Red above fifty miles. According to the proposer. If the speedometer is divided into these three colors. Then when the needle is pointing from yellow to red. It will inevitably be subject to a spiritual effect and pay attention. The advocate of this proposal is Dr. Stasher of Panlia, Illinois. Qu has a slogan. It is said that "it is best not to point the needle to red."</p>
<p>Women Driving Car Records Mrs. Miller, an American expatriate in Shanghai. He and his daughter drove across America. In six days. Completed the 3,043-mile journey from Washington to Los Angeles. The car she drove was a Plymouth. There were no obstacles except for a punctured tire on the way. The itinerary for the six days is recorded as follows. Depart from Washington at 6:30 AM on the first morning, 407 miles. Bristol at 7:30 AM on the second day, 478 miles. Jackson at 6:30 AM on the third day, 454 miles. Mount Bristol at 6:30 AM on the fourth day, 430 miles. Great Fountain at 6:30 AM on the fifth day, 516 miles. Rosborough at 4:00 AM on the sixth day, 758 miles. The last day of the journey took the longest driving time. It is heard that Mrs. Miller never drove for two consecutive hours. But on that day, she traveled 758 miles in 19 hours. In addition to eating, fueling and resting. An average of forty miles per hour. It is enough to see that women are not incapable of long-term driving.</p>
<p>American Automobile Percentage The United States has always had the largest number of cars in the world. There are three reasons for this. The United States is the largest producer of automobiles. We all know that there are many automobile factories in Detroit. The annual production of cars is in the millions. The production is rich and popular. Automobile prices are lower in the country. Therefore, middle-class families can purchase them. Used as daily transportation products. Not regarded as a luxury item. As for wealthy families, those who own three or four cars are even more common. The number calculated across the country is naturally considerable. The roads in the United States are good. The road lines are very long. And it is the origin of gasoline production, and the driving force and the place of use are superior. I think it is more widely used. According to statistics from the First National Bank of Boston. The current automobile registration statistics in the United States are 24,840,000 vehicles. It actually accounts for 72% of the world's automobile registration.</p>
<h3 id="e204">A Visit to Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (Continued) <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Xijia</p>
<p>Safety Items The entire factory building is constructed with lead-skinned steel bones. Not easy to catch fire. Engine. Generator. The machine wheels are all properly protected. The power generation room is far away from the factory. In order to avoid danger. I heard that since the start of construction. Within three years. There have been no deaths due to work accidents.</p>
<p>Hygiene Items What we can't forget the most in our minds. Is the phenomenon of cleanliness in the factory. There is absolutely no dirt and grease on the factory floor. It's simply so clean that it doesn't look like a factory. Probably the universal love of cleanliness of the Japanese people and the strict management of the factory are the expression. The factory is modeled after the latest type of flat ladder-shaped building. There is ample light. Air circulation. In addition, there is also a large canteen for workers.</p>
<p>Personnel Management The most eye-catching thing. Workers wear uniform uniforms. In good order. They are very diligent and lively at work. There are few signs of fatigue. Workers all stay out. Lunch is only in the factory. Workers have no formal groups or guilds. Only the organizations of the Peace Association and the Sports Association. According to Yun Peace Association is the nature of mutual support for the illness and support for the good fortune of the workers. Anyone who hires a new worker. It must be trained before starting work Yun.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Miscellaneous Remarks <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The visit lasted for three hours. Only then was it completed. Although I dare not say that the factory is perfect. But with the construction of three years. There is such a great organization. Perfect management. It's really commendable. I can't help but express my great admiration to the people of their country for their efforts in industry. However, if there is no government to make every effort to protect and subsidize and promote. Emerging industries. It is very difficult to make such rapid progress all of a sudden. This shows the enthusiasm of their government for industry. Especially the promotion of heavy military industry. Looking back at the situation in our country. It's really unimaginable.</p>
<p>After that. The reporter once asked the leader. Whether the factory plans to increase the production of large automobiles recently. According to Yun, the local market needs a large number of small automobiles, coupled with the government's special encouragement and promotion for the manufacture of small cars. Such as the special exemption from the driving test regulations. That is, all men and women over the age of sixteen. Allow free driving of small cars. General Exemption from driving tests. Reduce the license tax for small cars and allow no garage regulations. In order to protect the development of the industry. Furthermore, because large cars have fewer sales, the production cost is too high. I am afraid that it will not be able to match the imports from the United States. But when necessary or in wartime. The factory can manufacture large automobiles at any time. In order to replace foreign products and at the same time can be converted into military tanks. Armored car. The possibility of armored trains Yunyun. I hope our authorities and compatriots pay attention to it. (End)</p>
