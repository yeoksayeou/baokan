<h3>Pacific Science Association Closes; No Results from Discussions on Various Issues; Aizawa Says Failure to Take Timely Action Will Lead to War; Japan Unwilling to Express its Limits on Development in Asia</h3>
<p>Yosemite: Today, it was learned from representatives of various countries at the Pacific Science Association that representatives from the UK, the US, and Russia exerted pressure on Japanese representatives during round table meetings and off-site talks, hoping that Japanese representatives would briefly indicate the outline of Japan's desire to develop in Asia. However, no satisfactory response has been obtained so far. The only result of the Pacific Science Association conference is that Japanese and Russian representatives have been able to understand each other's policies in the Pacific. At the final meeting of the Pacific Science Association today, Japanese representative and former Foreign Minister Aizawa declared that Pacific issues are difficult to find solutions that satisfy all countries, saying that Pacific issues are of great importance and that relations between countries are becoming increasingly tense, and that failure to stop them in time will lead to serious consequences. British representative and former Secretary of the Navy Alexander also expressed pessimism, saying that the shadow of war is now approaching, and that he personally advocates promoting friendly relations through diplomacy rather than the navy. French representative Dunanou declared that the United States has restored the gold standard and still regards itself as a creditor nation, so there is hope for the improvement of international trade. As for Pacific peace, only the conclusion of bilateral treaties and the organization of a collective security system can guarantee it. The conference then elected the next officers, with Duff, editor of the Canadian Liberal News, elected as chairman, Hu Shi of China, Ishii of Japan, and Wilbur, president of Stanford University in the United States, as vice-chairmen, Pike, former Secretary of the Army of the United States, as treasurer, and Card, representative of the United States, as secretary-general.

<h3>Hebei-Chahar Inspection Office: Tianjin Customs Says It Has Not Heard of It; Smuggling Crackdown Will Not Slacken; Ministry of Finance Commissioner Arrives in Tianjin for Inspection</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The establishment of the Hebei-Chahar-Beijing-Tianjin Inspection Office will be delayed by two days. Tianjin Customs said that it has not heard of it in detail. If it becomes a reality, there may be a conflict of authority. It will ask the Ministry of Finance for instructions. Customs will not slacken its efforts to crack down on smuggling. In addition to the tax bills issued by the Customs itself, any licenses issued by any organization will be deemed invalid for transit goods. As of the 31st, the municipal government has not yet received an order from the Hebei-Chahar Council to protect special trade. Personnel from the inspection office in Tianjin have not had significant work either. Li Qingxuan, commissioner of the Ministry of Finance, arrived in Tianjin at 6:00 AM on the 31st, visited Xu Liya, customs commissioner of Tianjin, at noon to inquire about smuggling work, and visited Secretary Ma of the municipal government at 3:00 PM for talks. He will stay for two days before going to Beijing. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) By order of the Chinese Ministry of Finance, the various agencies of Hebei and Chahar provinces will crack down on trade goods in eastern Hebei. The Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee recently decided to establish inspection offices in Tianjin and branch offices in Beiping, Baoding, Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, Cangzhou, Botouzhen, Qikou and other eight places. A consumption tax of one-eighth of the Chinese customs duty will be levied on trade goods in eastern Hebei, and the goods will be allowed to be freely transported in Hebei and Chahar provinces and the cities of Beijing and Tianjin. The organizational regulations were issued on the 30th and will be implemented on September 1. Wang Hongsi, the current director of the Beining Railway Inspection Office, will concurrently serve as the director of the new inspection office, and Yuan Chongti will serve as the deputy director. The provincial government has issued orders to the public security bureaus and troops of various counties to cooperate in handling affairs. (31st Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The establishment of an inspection office by the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee provides a new opportunity for trade in eastern Hebei. The Hebei-Chahar region can thus obtain a monthly income of 300,000 yuan. Although the reason for the Hebei-Chahar government's adoption of this measure is a financial problem, it can be recognized as taking into account its relationship with neighboring areas and wanting to avoid being the cause of various incidents. The fundamental reason is nothing more than reducing the heavy tax burden on the people of Hebei and Chahar provinces and revitalizing their economic capacity. After receiving this news, traders in eastern Hebei are actively discussing the transportation of goods. Its impact on Central China and South China in the future is worthy of attention. (31st Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to news from Chinese and Japanese newspapers here, the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee has decided that from tomorrow, a new tax will be levied on "special goods" transported into the Cangyan counties south of Tianjin, amounting to one-eighth of the Chinese customs duty. All goods that have paid this tax will be protected by the authorities. After the implementation of this decision, goods that were previously considered smuggled goods by the customs and detained will be transformed into legal imports and can be freely transported into Hebei and Chahar and transferred to other places without any difficulty. It is said that this new tax will be collected by the "General Inspection Office" established by the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, which is effectively an independent customs administrative agency. Under this new measure, the entire coast of Hebei Province will become a large loophole in China's national tax barrier. At present, within the jurisdiction of the "Autonomous" government of eastern Hebei north of Tianjin, all goods are allowed to pay only one-quarter of the Chinese customs duty to be imported. There is no doubt that while the new tax can enrich the income of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, it will affect eastern Hebei and legitimate customs duties. Officials of the committee remained silent this morning when asked about this matter, neither confirming nor denying it, and only said that the matter is still under consideration. However, according to reliable Chinese sources, the order regarding the new tax has been distributed to various tax checkpoints and other relevant authorities. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Spanish Armies</h3>
<h3>Contend for the Barrier North of the Capital</h3>
<h3>Rebel Troops Retreat, Government Troops Counterattack</h3>
<h3>Thousands of Refugees Flee to France in Distress</h3>
<p>(Madrid) Special dispatch from our correspondent with the army on the front lines of the Guadarrama Mountains north of the capital. Yesterday, government artillery bombarded the rebel positions on the Leon Plateau all day long. From a distance, the area was ablaze with fire, with several barracks hit and burning. A regular army unit belonging to the rebels attacked the government troops under air cover, but they were repulsed by Colonel Asensio and his militia, who then launched a counterattack. At the same time, another column of government troops, led by Colonel Yigada, continued to encircle the Leon Plateau and attack the rebels from the rear. Our correspondent witnessed many rebels fleeing from the town of San Rafael through the province of Segovia. (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Lisbon) The Spanish Civil War is currently at its most intense. The rebel troops are getting closer and closer to Madrid. The defending forces in Irun and San Sebastian have resisted attacks by rebel aircraft and artillery for five days. It is still difficult to predict the outcome. (Guomin News Agency dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>(Valladolid) The rebel troops' attack on Irun in the northeast of Spain has entered its fifth day, but the government defending forces are still holding the city. Machine guns and barbed wire are making it extremely difficult for the attacking infantry, and it is said that they have suffered heavy losses. This afternoon, several rebel aircraft dropped 20 bombs near the government positions at the San Marcial fortress, but the damage was minimal. At the same time, two rebel warships fired ten rounds at the government's heavily fortified positions at the Guadalupe fortress. (Reuters dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>(Hendaye) The rebel troops in northern Spain warned the officials and civilians of Irun yesterday that if they refused to surrender, they would open fire with their navy, army, and air force today, burning the entire city to the ground. Upon hearing this news, the city authorities ordered all women, children, and the elderly to evacuate to France, and brought out all the political prisoners detained in the Guadalupe Fortress and various prisons, scattering them in the main streets and squares of the city, warning the rebels that if they opened fire, these political prisoners would be the first to die. The most famous of the political prisoners are Pradera, the leader of the Carlist Party in Gipuzkoa Province, Mora, a member of parliament from Galicia and the brother of the former Prime Minister, and several bishops from Valladolid. However, as of the time of dispatch, the rebel side had only sent one aircraft to drop a few bombs on the city and had not officially opened fire. According to news from Valladolid, the fascists in the city ambushed and executed several members of the left-wing Republican trade union. (Havas dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>(Hendaye) The rebel troops' final warning that they would raze Irun to the ground by dawn if the defending forces did not surrender seems to be an empty threat, as no shots have been fired by the rebels after midnight. However, the residents are filled with panic, and lines of women and children are fleeing into France all night long. More than two thousand refugees have arrived in France so far, and hundreds more are spending the night at the Hendaye train station and cafes in a state of distress. At dawn, young women holding babies could be seen sitting on the steps on both sides of the road to rest, while slightly older children stood beside them, crying in fright. The military police and news reporters had to step over the refugees' luggage to reach the train station. Most of the refugees were unable to bring their belongings in a hurry, and were mostly wrapped in blankets. Almost all the refugees are poor and are now being assisted by the French Popular Front. Now that the wives and children of the defending forces have all left the country, their morale will be affected, and they may resort to slaughtering rebel prisoners in the next day or two. (Reuters dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Hendaye) Relevant parties are currently working hard to expand the scope of the conference so that the Spanish Civil War is not only humane, but also a preliminary step towards a truce in the country. It is now felt that neither the Spanish government nor the rebel troops have a sure chance of winning soon, but the Spanish government has stated firmly that it is unwilling to negotiate with the rebel troops.

<h3>Northern Rebel Troops</h3>
<h3>Bombard Border Fortress</h3>
<h3>Ministry of the Interior Announces Military Victory</h3>
<p>(Hendaye) Regarding the war news in northern Spain, it has just been learned that the revolutionary navy cruiser "España" and the destroyer "Velasco" repeatedly bombarded the Spanish border area between 5:00 and 6:00 PM today. In one hour, only 12 shells were fired, four of which fell near the Guadalupe fortress, and the other eight were fired towards the port of Pasajes. As for the two armies, there was no contact today, and the front line was peaceful. The soldiers in the revolutionary army sometimes sang loudly to express their satisfaction, and their impassioned singing could be heard even in the village of Biriatou on the border. The government troops were also mostly optimistic, but calm. Irun was bombed by revolutionary aircraft this morning, but there were no deaths or injuries. There was a small contact in Andoain, west of San Sebastian, but there were no changes in the front lines. The director of the National Investigation Office, Mani, recently came here from Paris and will meet with Matian, the prefect of the Lower Pyrenees province, to discuss matters before inspecting the border area for a week. He expressed great satisfaction with the preparedness work of the local military police and guerrillas. (Havas dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>(Madrid) According to war news released by the Ministry of the Interior last night, the rebel troops launched attacks on various fronts, but were all repulsed. For example, in the western province of Cáceres, the rebel troops launched a fierce attack on Navalmoral de la Mata, but were finally repulsed by the government troops after eight hours of fierce fighting. In Malaga in the south, rebel troops also launched a fierce attack, but were repulsed by the government troops, who seized a large number of weapons and captured many rebel troops. In the Guadarrama Mountains north of the capital, the rebel troops attempted to attack, but were also unsuccessful. Over a hundred rebel troops were killed by the government troops, and many were captured, including several soldiers from Moroccan cities. In addition, near Córdoba in the south, government troops have seized several new positions, and there have been small contacts in the Granada area. As for the front lines in Gipuzkoa province in the north, although there have been no changes in the positions occupied by the government troops, all civilians, women, children, and the elderly in Irun have been ordered to evacuate to France. Several rebel aircraft dropped leaflets over the city a few days ago, warning residents that if they refused to surrender, they would open fire with their navy, air force, and artillery today, burning the entire city to the ground, and that they would all perish together and regret it too late. The authorities were sincerely concerned about harming innocent civilians and immediately ordered all women, children, and the elderly to evacuate. (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Bayonne) According to government sources, government troops have now reached the border of Huesca, an important railway junction controlling the road to Zaragoza. It is also claimed that a government aircraft bombed a column of rebel troops heading to rescue Huesca, inflicting heavy damage on the rebel troops during the attack. (Reuters dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Lisbon) It was learned here today that staff at the German Embassy in Spain closed the embassy today because Madrid is in imminent danger, and fled to Alicante on the Mediterranean coast. The US Embassy also warned American citizens to evacuate immediately. It was heard that the rebel troops had originally planned to attack Irun again on Sunday night, but there was no movement as of 11:00 PM that night. (Guomin News Agency dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Aircraft</h3>
<h3>Bomb American Warship</h3>
<h3>US Government Protests</h3>
<p>(Washington) The State Department received an official report stating that the US destroyer "Kane" was attacked three times by a Spanish aircraft off the coast of Spain, with a total of six bombs dropped. The warship returned fire with anti-aircraft guns nine times. The Spanish aircraft was a three-engine type. It was not possible to identify which side it belonged to. Fortunately, none of the six bombs hit. The warship was flying the American flag and had the American emblem painted on the deck, making it easy to see from the air. Secretary of State Hull has lodged protests with the Spanish government and rebel leader General Franco over the incident. (Reuters dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Rabbit Run, USA) President Roosevelt was informed that a Spanish aircraft of unknown origin dropped bombs near the American warship "Kane" 38 miles off the coast of Spain today. President Roosevelt immediately suspended his tour of the drought-stricken area and ordered Secretary of State Hull to lodge protests with the Spanish government and the rebel side. However, it was reported that the warship was not damaged. The warship returned fire at the time. The captain is Captain Alvin and there are 120 sailors on board.

<h3>Roman Catholic Church</h3>
<h3>Opposes Neutrality Agreement</h3>
<h3>Reporter Describes Plight of Rebel Troops</h3>
<p>(Roman Catholic Church) The Spanish Civil War has lasted for over a month. The People's Front army has been extremely hostile to the Catholic Church, committing acts of sacrilege and harming priests. Several religious ceremonies were held here today to atone for sins. The most important was a prayer for the relics of the Spanish saints. Father Fandoli gave a speech, strongly condemning the atrocities in Spain, saying, "Bolshevism is now trying to put all of Europe in a common harm and wants to promote its power all the way to the heart of the Americas. We should appeal to God to reveal the conspiracy of the party and awaken public opinion. In view of this, concluding a non-interference agreement is absurd. We should reverently pray and, with the spirit of compassion and solidarity, intervene." (Havas dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>(Madrid) According to a French correspondent who recently returned from visiting Toledo, the rebel troops defending the historically famous Moorish Alcázar fortress are starving and fighting among themselves, and are under attack from the sky and explosions from landmines. This is the fate that the rebel troops face every day. The governor of the province, who is loyal to the government, told him that the 1,300 rebel troops in the fortress have been besieged by government troops for several weeks. There are 300 women and children inside, all hiding in the cellar. Because the houses were destroyed by shelling, the entrance to the cellar was blocked and many people suffocated to death. The government troops could have taken the fortress in a few hours, but because there are many landmines buried in the fortress, they have to force the defending troops to surrender. The government troops, in view of the fact that many people were forced to join the rebel troops, do not want to see people killed indiscriminately. At present, the rebel troops in the fortress are suffering from a lack of food. The supply of food for these people depends on the rebel aircraft dropping it from the sky, but in order to avoid being shot at by the government's anti-aircraft guns, the aircraft have to fly at a very high altitude, so the food they drop often falls outside the boundary of the area. The troops in the fortress are getting very little food. Because a portion of the defending troops are willing to surrender to the government troops, there are daily struggles within the fortress. The top few floors of the fortress have been burned down by shelling, so the rebel troops are in a very precarious situation. (Reuters dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Madrid) The Madrid Trade Union Federation, which belongs to the Spanish National Trade Union Federation, issued a notice today stating that "Now that the country is in a critical situation, no one is allowed to take advantage of the opportunity to avenge personal grievances, nor should they act rashly, causing panic among industrialists and businessmen and creating a bad impression in public opinion. Anyone who breaks into another person's residence without being able to explain a proper reason will be treated as a rioter. Anyone who violates the above prohibition will be sent to the court in the Model Prison for strict interrogation. Everyone must abide by this and not violate it." (Havas dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<h3>Arab Higher Committee</h3>
<h3>Agrees to Iraqi Mediation</h3>
<h3>Turning Point in Palestine Question</h3>
<p>(Jerusalem) After several days of discussion, the Arab Higher Committee has unanimously decided to accept the mediation of General Nuri, the official representative of the Iraqi government, so there is a tendency towards peace in Palestine. At the same time, the Arab general strike is still in progress and can only be canceled after the decision of the Higher Committee is approved by a general meeting of the Arab local committees. (Reuters dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Jerusalem) Regarding the dispute between the Arabs and Jews, after Foreign Minister Nuri of Iraq proposed a mediation plan and came here himself to conduct negotiations, progress has been smooth. The Arab Higher Committee recently issued a public announcement, stating, "The Iraqi government, based on the wishes expressed by the Arab nation, has taken on the task of mediation, which this committee has already decided to accept. Nuri left for Turkey at noon today, via the Syrian mandate of Beirut, in order to conduct negotiations with representatives of the British government, with the joint support of Turkish President Kemal and the governments of other Arab nations. Until the negotiations are concluded, the strike movement will continue until a joint decision is made by a general meeting of the district committees." In view of this, although a ray of dawn has appeared in the solution path, the situation is still serious at this time. (Havas dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<h3>Italian Autumn Military Exercises End</h3>
<h3>Mussolini Boasts</h3>
<h3>Able to Mobilize Eight Million People in Hours</h3>
<p>(Avellino, Italy) The Italian army's grand military exercises, which lasted for a week, ended today. Prime Minister Mussolini, accompanied by General Badoglio, the former commander of the Italian East African Expeditionary Force, and Fascist Party Secretary-General Starace, arrived by car to give instructions. He said that the troops participating in today's military exercises only accounted for a part of Italy's strength. He urged the people to pay attention to the strength of Italy's military, which was unprecedented. Although Italy has been involved in the war in Abyssinia, it is now able to mobilize eight million people in hours. Tomorrow, the King will inspect 60,000 troops, 200 tanks, 4,000 cannons, and 3,000 machine guns in the Volturno River basin. This strong force is the result of the Fascist Party's 14 years of training. Italy is committed to maintaining peace both domestically and internationally. Italy's peace is the guarantee of world peace. The arms race can no longer be stopped. Mussolini expressed his regret for the failure of the disarmament conference and the political alliances caused by the arms race. He also believed that the war against Abyssinia was a just war, saying that Italy is now able to develop Abyssinia, and this work will take decades. The Italian Empire was not created by diplomacy, but by five major wars. Its spirit is enough to overcome all difficulties and discourage the courage of countries that conspire against us. At this point, Mussolini asked loudly, "Have all the old debts been cleared?" The crowd answered "No." He then asked, "Can we move forward courageously?" The crowd answered "Yes." Italian army officers declared today that live ammunition was used in this military exercise, but no one was injured. One person died and several were injured in the first live ammunition exercise last year. (Guomin News Agency dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>(Avellino, Italy) The grand army military exercises began here on the 25th of this month. This small town has become a gathering place for government officials and foreign observers. The exercises have now ended. Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a speech to the local people, stating, "The 14th army military exercises since the establishment of the Fascist regime have now ended. Tomorrow, the King of Italy and Emperor of Abyssinia, Emmanuel III, will personally inspect the entire army on the Volterra plains. At that time, there will be 60,000 soldiers, 200 tanks, 400 cannons, 400 mortars, 3,000 machine guns, and 2,800 trucks parading before the throne. Such a large number of personnel and such complete military equipment are indeed spectacular, but in terms of all the personnel and all the military equipment that Italy relies on today, this is only a part, mediocre and insignificant. I am now issuing a firm and unchangeable declaration, and I hope that my compatriots will keep it in mind. What is the declaration? That is, the entire military strength of our country today, even after the eight-month Italian-Abyssinian War, is even more substantial than before the war. This is thanks to the Italian-Abyssinian War, and this war has not reduced our country's strength. At present, as soon as the government issues an order, it can mobilize 8 million people in an instant to go to war. Some say that lasting peace is not allowed by the Fascist ideology that we hold. This is absurd. On the contrary, we sincerely hope to maintain peace with all countries and will do everything possible to make peace last for a long time. We are already prepared and are willing to cooperate with other countries with all our strength to contribute to the cause of peace among all nations. At the same time, we must also strive to strengthen ourselves so that we can cope with all future events and deal with any future destiny with composure." (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Berlin correspondent of the "Excelsior" newspaper recently sent a message stating that German people feel quite favorable about the speech made by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday in Avellino. In general, after the release of this speech, the importance of Germany's extension of compulsory military service was obscured and retreated to a secondary position. This is one reason why Germany is expressing goodwill. The correspondent further said, "The Italian Prime Minister also mentioned a certain political combination, saying that its nature is questionable. German people believe that this statement refers to the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact. In Germany's view, this pact is considered the most dangerous factor in the current European situation. In addition, Germany is now preparing to use the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact as an excuse in the upcoming Five-Power Conference to distort the legitimacy of its policies, so that the participating countries will accept its proposal to conclude a Western European Pact, or to make Italy and other European countries clear that France must distance itself from Russia, otherwise, the Western European Pact will have no hope of realization. Therefore, it goes without saying that Germany feels gratified by the Prime Minister's remarks." (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>

<p>July Hotel Industry Aviation Donation Statistics. The city's hotel industry has been enthusiastically supported by people from all walks of life and the industry in the collection of aviation patriotic funds, and the monthly receipts have been announced repeatedly. In July, Zhang Yuliang, a cadre sent by the General Captain's Office, went to various hotels to collect donations. The records are as follows. Seventy-fourth Meeting of the General Captain's Office of the Aviation Association. The General Captain's Office of the Shanghai Recruitment Team of the Chinese Aviation Association held its 74th office meeting at 2 pm on the 29th.

The chairman, Li, Chief Executive Officer, and Recorder Chen Shuo, the chairman reported briefly that the second solicitation campaign started in March last year, but the progress was slightly slower due to the sluggish market. Therefore, the end period has been repeatedly delayed and it has been decided to end at the end of this month.

Since January of this year, the production and sales of national goods in the city have increased by more than one-third compared with the same period last year. There are already 12 national goods companies established in various provinces and cities. The future of the industry will develop day by day. The reporter interviewed Pan Yangyao, a giant in the industry, and learned the following. Reasons for brisk sales. The production and sales of national goods in the city this year are better than in previous years. From January to July, it increased by more than one-third compared with the same period last year. If the smuggling in North China is stopped immediately, the future development will be limitless. The reasons for the brisk sales are nothing more than (1) Good harvests in various places, increased purchasing power of the people, (2) National goods manufacturers are working hard to promote sales, (3) The price of national goods is lower than that of foreign goods, (4) The exchange rate in the inland is low (such as the exchange rate in Guangdong and Sichuan, which is much lower than in the past), (5) The sales volume in Guangdong, Sichuan and Northwest China has increased sharply, etc., so the national goods industry in the city can create excellent production and sales records in the sluggishness of all industries. Promotion in various places. In the past four or five years, patriotic men and women in various places have devoted themselves to the promotion of national goods, so the results have been remarkable. The provinces and cities that have established national goods companies include Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Xuzhou, Xi'an, Baxian, Kunming, Guangzhou, Changsha, Zhengzhou, Jinan, Fuzhou, Wenzhou, and other 12 places. National goods manufacturers in the city are currently negotiating with local merchants in places where national goods companies have not yet been established to discuss establishment methods. At the same time, they hope that cooperatives in various places will handle the sales of national goods and introduce local specialties for export. Hope not to levy excessively. In order to facilitate the transportation of goods to the inland, national goods manufacturers in the city hope that transportation will be improved on the one hand, and hope that the inland authorities will abolish the special taxes that hinder the production and sales of national goods on the other. According to recent surveys, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Sichuan, Hunan, Yunnan, Shaanxi, and other places have levied this special tax. At present, the financial authorities are strictly abolishing excessive taxes and miscellaneous taxes, which will soon be abolished one by one, and the production and sales of national goods will definitely be greatly facilitated. Overseas Chinese Cooperation. It is also learned that overseas Chinese businessmen in the Nanyang Islands such as Singapore, Surabaya, Batavia, etc. are now preparing to organize national goods introduction centers and national goods exhibition halls, which will be established soon. In the future, the transportation and sales of national goods will definitely increase compared to before. However, due to the lack of state-owned merchant ships to transport goods, the goods are delayed, which has a great impact on sales. If China Merchants Bureau can open up the Nanyang route in the future, it will also be greatly facilitated. The Shanghai-Ping Line will be operated with Stinson aircraft. Shanghai Postal Administration Announcement No. 1346 states that the Shanghai-Ping Line of China National Aviation Corporation will be operated with Douglas aircraft on Fridays, which has been announced in Announcement No. 2342.

The head of the police sent Chinese detective Liu Decheng and detective Xu Shutian to arrest him at his residence and take him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to Criminal Court 3 of the First Special District Court. Labor Bureau lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that the case was complicated and the defendant completely denied the four letters at the police station. The four letters are currently stored at the police station for research and verification. The plaintiff, Zhou Qishan, stated that the defendant was indeed his brother-in-law and had four brothers. Five years ago, he borrowed 300 yuan from a Ningbo bank on behalf of a friend with his father as guarantor. He had already repaid the loan and given it to his father-in-law, but he did not get a receipt. After his father-in-law passed away in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, his brothers divided the property and the defendant asked him to participate in the lawsuit, writing letters himself, stating that if he won the lawsuit, he could get unexpected benefits. The second and third letters of the four threatening letters were written by him. When questioned, the defendant stated that he did not instigate him to participate in the property division. A certain lawyer sent a letter beforehand, but the result was a loss. The loan of 300 yuan was actually not repaid. Because he recently demanded repayment from him, he harbored resentment and falsely accused him and hired Fan Gang as his lawyer, claiming that the case was about demanding a loan of 300 yuan and had been filed in the Civil Court of the Court. The threatening letters were written by himself and sent through the mail to falsely accuse his brother-in-law and subject him to criminal punishment. He requested bail to be released.

It is difficult for each store to maintain its business losses. It is impossible to close down, and generally unscrupulous landlords are suing for rent in court, taking advantage of the situation to execute provisional attachments, resulting in the closure of dozens of businesses such as Tian Tian Restaurant, Qiaoxiang Restaurant, Fuli Shoe Store, Wang Shunyu, and Yichengtai. We should plan relief measures to assist in the recovery of commerce. Resolution: In addition to requesting assistance from the government authorities, we also request the local court to sympathize with the difficulties of businesses and prevent them from falling into decline. (2) Shao Yurun proposed that from the iron gate on Old Bazi Road to the end of North Sichuan Road, most of the shops are closed. If the shops are open for business, there are few customers in front of the doors, which is a miserable sight, far less than the market conditions before the war. The reasons are nothing more than two: (A) Rents are high and difficult to bear. (B) The armed obstacles are not removed all day long, and the market is difficult to recover. Therefore, it is urgent to seek a fundamental solution to be effective. Please vote on the case. Resolution: Thoroughly investigate rental rates so that we can negotiate with the landlords based on reason, reduce the burden, and devise ways to remove obstacles. (2) Citizens' Training Solicitation Training Class Xu Chang case, resolution, issue notices and solicit volunteers from each member to join the training.

<h3>Central Government's Two Memorial Weeks: Chiang Tso-pin Reports on the Abundance Problem</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held its 39th weekly memorial service for the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen at 8:00 AM on the 31st. Present were Central Committee members Chiang Tso-pin, Ting Wei-fen, Chu Chia-hua, Fang Chih, Chang Li-sheng, Ching Heng-yi, Wang Yung-bin, Chang Chong, Ma Chao-chun, Teng Chia-yen, Fu Ping-chang, Wu Ching-hsiung, Chang Chen, Chou Chi-kang, Li Wen-fan, Shao Hua, Miao Pei-cheng, Wang Shu-fang, Li Tsung-huang, and all staff members, totaling over 700 people. Chairman Chiang Tso-pin led the ceremony and reported on the abundance problem, stating that in previous years, the government received telegrams from various provinces across the country reporting disasters and famines, one after another. However, this year is different. As of now, the Ministry of Interior has not received a single document reporting a disaster or famine. Furthermore, according to personal reports he has received, all provinces in the country have had a bumper harvest this year. He learned in Anhui that the province had a 140% harvest this year. In Lushan, he met with Chairmen Xiong of Jiangxi and Yang of Hubei, who informed him that Jiangxi had a 140% harvest and Hubei also had a full harvest. This situation is unprecedented in decades and is something for the people of the country to celebrate. However, with such a bountiful harvest, management methods for warehousing should be strictly improved, so that the people are not affected by low grain prices harming farmers. Regarding the improvement of warehousing, reorganizing old warehouses, and building new warehouses, the Ministry of Interior has drafted regulations, which are currently being submitted to the Executive Yuan. Once approved, they will be circulated to all provinces for implementation, so that this unprecedented bumper harvest will not be damaged due to poor storage. He hopes that all comrades will pay attention to this and offer their suggestions. After Chiang's speech, the meeting adjourned. (Central News Agency, 31st)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) President Sun of the Executive Yuan, in his report at the National Government's weekly memorial service on the 31st, shared his observations on the domestic situation. He first stated that in recent years, the domestic situation has shown considerable progress in all aspects. This year, not only has there been a bumper harvest of rice and crops, with the rural areas showing signs of recovery, but the country is also gradually moving towards peaceful unification in the political arena. Two months ago, Guangdong Province threatened the central government with military action, causing widespread concern among the people about the outbreak of civil war. However, due to the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session, which advocated peaceful unification, the military and civilian officials in Guangdong were able to sincerely accept the central government's resolutions after the session concluded. Such a major issue was largely resolved in just five or six days, which not only pleased all parties within the country, who believed that the central government's policy of peaceful unification had been effective, but also changed the perception of foreigners, who believed that China could now be unified and would no longer experience any disputes. This is truly gratifying. However, there have been some recent setbacks in Guangxi Province. Mr. Li, Bai, and others may still have some doubts about the central government's resolutions and may not fully understand the central government's peaceful policies. According to his observations, since Chairman Chiang's arrival in Guangdong, he has emphasized peaceful principles and is willing to accept any reasonable compromises. Furthermore, the people and central government officials all hope for peaceful unification, and even the military and civilians in Guangxi would certainly not want to start a civil war and hasten the country's demise. Since all parties hope for peaceful unification and the establishment of a strong and powerful nation, he believes that the Guangxi issue can be resolved peacefully. From this perspective, it can be said that there has been significant progress in domestic affairs. He continued by saying that previously, there were those in the country who advocated for an aggressive foreign policy, and those who advocated for a more moderate one, and the people's sentiments may have been divided. However, after years of national crisis, everyone should have gained considerable awareness that in order to unify the country, the central government must be a powerful government, and only after unification can the government devote itself to consolidating the foundation of the country and restoring its sovereignty. The central government has a thorough understanding of the current Guangxi issue and sincerely hopes for their understanding. Therefore, he believes that a resolution is not far off. He believes that Chairman Chiang will adhere to the central government's established policies and uphold the principle of peace, and that Mr. Li and Bai, who have been patriotic soldiers in the past, will certainly understand the central government's position and achieve unification soon. After the country is unified, not only will friendly nations be pleased, but those who insult us will also change their attitude. The current national environment is extremely difficult, and any event in one area can affect the entire nation. Therefore, we should strive to achieve peaceful unification as soon as possible. If internal troubles can be avoided, external threats can also be eliminated. These are his thoughts on the domestic situation today, and he shares them with everyone for reference.
