<p>— 華</p>
<p>最近國際關係的發展有逐漸回復到戰前形勢的趨向法蘇的親善英法的携手德日軍事同盟的秘密進行英美聯合戰線的漸决形成都是顯明的徵象這種結合的形勢在組成的份子方面雖然和第一决大戰前有若干的差異但其根本的方式是相同的卽均勢的對立愈加强烈陣綫的劃分亦益增顯明一朝有一角的均勢突破立刻全線可被牽動而爆發爲泛世界的大戰這種形勢的發展其關係影響甚巨吾人不能不加以密切的注意</p>
<p>戰前國際關係的發展是一部分新興的帝國主義不滿意於世界分割的現狀向原來佔有世界優勢的帝國主義挑戰當時代表新興帝國主義的勢力的主要爲德國而代表佔有世界優勢的帝國主義的主要爲英法在英法之問本來亦有强烈的鬥爭如關於蘇丹的爭奪亦幾至引起了戰爭但英法衝突的危機因穗國勢力的崛起漸趨於緩和德帝國主義初露臉於世界卽以强硬的姿態促成了英法的合作等到穗國聯合奧匈意國成立反現狀的同盟英法與帝俄卽進行恊商組成了維持現狀的結合雙方壁壘分明一到均勢突破全面的戰爭就爆發了</p>
<p>戰後十餘年來代表世界優勢的帝國主義者仍舊爲英法而美國也算是一個代表新與而不　於現狀者則爲大戰中因投機而得利的日意兩國最近德帝國主義復活也可歸入於這一方面一九三一年日帝國主義進攻滿洲爲衝破現狀的第一砲去年意帝國主義侵路東非爲第二砲德國已重整軍備等到力量長成時機成熟要求歸還舊殖民地便是第三砲了這種衝破現狀要求重分世界的舉動其最初的形式和反響是很散漫的在世界佔有優勢的英法美等國因爲相互間本有種種嚴重的衝突不能立刻捐除成見合起來對付反現狀的勢力但這種情形足使反現狀的勢力益增猛烈而反現狀勢力的增强不已終必促成維持現狀者的聯合戰前德皇威廉在東非及摩洛孫拓展勢力兩决拒絕英國的勸告終至英法捐除成見結成聯合戰綫最近慕沙里尼堅持對於東非的侵略不顧英國的調解又使英法捨棄多年來爭霸大陸所積之嫌忌成立切實的合作在遠東政局中英美相互猜忌本來和戰前英俄的對立相同而英國對於日本侵略大陸的優容正似當年日俄戰爭中英國的陰助日本但最近日帝國主義無限度的侵略及其在海軍問題上所表示的强硬態度已使英國由焦急而至不能忍耐終必與美國形成聯合抗拒的戰綫在目前的階段英法合作與英美團結的形勢雖然還沒有達到充分的强固但在歐洲意國的態度若再不緩和或更進一步與反現狀的另一勢力德國相結合在遠東日本的侵略若繼續推進甚至與歐洲軍國主義的代表者穗國成立同盟則維持現狀者的團結亦必更進一步這兩種陣錢劃分淸楚大戰卽可一觸而發了</p>
<p>最近國際局勢的回復到戰前狀態使我們感覺到第二决世界大戰的危樓又迫近了一步將來大碰擊的來臨是弱小民族的一個巨刦也是被壓迫者爭求解放的一伺良機然而這種刦運的避免與機會的應用端賴我們在事前的注意與準備</p>

<p>倫敦英外相艾登將赴日內瓦、代表英國出席國聯行政院會議、考慮意阿爭端、今日在其選舉區發表公開演說、艾登自就外相之後、對衆發言、此爲第一决、</p>
<p>艾氏謂、國聯會員應能使任何侵略國覺悟、和平談判、不獨爲消滅觖望之最好方法、且亦爲成功之唯一方法也、集體安全、非可容易取得者、必須有各方面不懈之工作與犧牲而後可、以全體言、一九三五年頗有良好之聯絡工作、但一九三六年必須較前聯絡更爲密切、卽在一九三七年、亦必視此更有進步也、吾人方面或國聯任何會員國方面、絕不可稍自饜滿、或自以爲得計、因目的尚未達到也、吾人所當作之努力、甚爲艱巨、但余信國人必認爲值得作此努力、英國之頒袖地位、乃時局嚴重中之重要因素、吾人不可稍有灰心、但必須實事求是、余當以此精神應付當此之艱難工作、吾人必須高瞻遠矚、而不以國聯所遇之目前戰局爲限、吾人當保持一二簡單要義、以余觀之、要義有二、　侵略行爲不可許其成功、　國聯會員國一致行動、定可成堅强而團結之團體、足使今日或將來之任何侵略家覺悟消滅怨望、其最上而可成功之唯一方法、在於和平談判、而不在於侵略、吾人允當前進一步、務使出席於日內瓦之他國、不獨在言論上、且在行動上、與吾人一致共同進行和平政策、採行各種增加吾人力量之必要方法、庶可達到和平、</p>

<p>近年來、我國政府當局、對航空公路的建築、可說是不遺餘力、長江以南的東西交通、向來利用港汶湖泊以為交通捷徑、到這時也起了一重改革、蘇浙閩皖贛湘諸省間公路網的大部完成、就是一個具體的說明、因此內地交通、大感便捷、但公路汽車交通的安全舒適、正確迅速、任重致遠、利用自由和取費低廉、揆諸事理、與利用鐵道火車、相去仍遠、而鐵道的亟望展築、反因此更見迫急、作為長江流域與珠江流域之間、內陸交通幹綫的浙贛鐵路、乃能在很經濟的財力、很短促的時間、和本國的技術人材主持下、完成一部分了、</p>
<p>浙贛路之籌建</p>
<p>浙贛路綫、原定以浙江的杭州和江西的萍鄕爲起迄點、全長九百〇四公里、其中自杭州經蕭山。諸暨。義烏。金華。湯溪。龍游·衢縣。江山。到江西玉山的一段、計長三百四十一公里、原名杭江鐵路、在民國十九年三月開始建築、廿二年十二月就完成通車、自玉山經上饒。橫峯·弋陽。貴溪·東鄕·進賢·到南昌的二百九十二公里－呌做玉南段－就在杭江鐵路通車以後、立卽開始籌備、二十三年四月、呈准鐵道部及浙贛兩省府、實行建築、至於自南昌到萍鄉－南萍段－之間的二百六十三公里、在本月十五日南玉段舉行通車典禮的那天亦開工展築了、</p>
<p>這一段的建築資本、是由鐵道部和財政部各發行公債一千二百萬元、合計二千四百萬元、以公債票面及玉南段完成後的全部資產担保，向上海銀行團及德商奧脫華爾失公司息借現欵和墊欵購料、實計一千六百萬元、成立浙贛鐵路聯合公司來主持全路的一切、自二十三年七月二十日起、全段分四總段、十六分段、同時興築、到二十四年十二月完工、一共以費十七個月的時光、假使在這時間內沒有受到水災和匪患的阻碍、在去年國慶日、早就可以通車了、</p>
<p>招待各界觀禮</p>
<p>記者接到浙贛鐵路聯合公司理事會定本月十五日在南昌舉行玉南段通車典禮的請柬以後、就在十三日下午三時、和上海中外各報記者一行十八人、同乘京閘特快通車赴杭、依照該請柬上印就的招待程序、要在當天下午八時以前到滬杭路南星橋站三廊廟待渡、</p>
<p>車過嘉興、空中就下起霏霏的雪來、鴛湖雖正是水落的時候、但和湖中的烟雨樓、却同像給誰蒙了一層白紗似的，另有一種絕妙的風趣、車到南屋橋、天下黑了、雲也已經深了、</p>
<p>通車典禮招待處、已經派了好幾位職員在站上照斜（原來他們這次招待的、不僅是上海的新聞記者、還有南京和杭州的、而主要的還是浙江省政府主席黃紹雄、鐵道部次長曾養甫、－兼浙贛鐵路聯合公司的理事長、所以也可說是主人－立法委員馬寅初、以及其他政黨要人。金融界。實業界·和該路沿錢的地方長官等等、所以一總有三百多人、他們預先備了十多輛小包車和公共汽車、接送來賓到三廊廟碼頭去、那裏是錢江大橋完成以前的主要渡口、每天從早晨六時直到傍晚六時、不絕地有來往於錢江兩岸的旅客、給錢江義渡送往迎來、江邊已築有新式鋼骨混凝土的棧橋、從岸邊的淺灘、直伸到江心的浮碼頭、約有半里之遠、這上面足容兩輛汽車的往來、</p>
<p>雪夜渡錢塘江</p>
<p>記者等到那裏時、正是八點鐘光景、江上雖還沒有怎樣凜冽寒風、雪是下得益發大了、在浮碼頭上、又守着那些慇懃的招待員、在那裏依照請柬號碼一一發給浙贛鐵路的臥車對號劵、到下義渡的時候、手脚都已經凍得麻木了、義渡是首尾翹得很高的大木船、有一間足容二十人的房艙、也許這晚特別一些、裏面都掛了一盞雪亮的汽油燈、在昏暗的江面上、每兩艘義渡給一艘小火輪拖帶過江、</p>
<p>西興江邊碼頭、也有這麼一座新式的棧橋和浮碼頭、不過棧橋是露天的、那裏邊已經有好多輛汽車等待着迎接來賓送往車站、其實、假如在白天看來、碼頭和車站之間、也許只有一箭之遙、</p>
<p>專車佈置一瞥</p>
<p>杭江段用的車軌、是三十五磅的輕軌、所以機車和客車、也受了限制、車身與京滬路的比較短·低、也許還狹一些、（雖則兩軌的距離是和京滬等路一樣）可是車中的設備、却比較完善、停在江邊車站的這列專車、一共是十五輛、有頭二三等客座及臥車。餐車、要人們乘的、是一輛「公事車」被舖齊備、車頭上交义着黨國旗、覆着紙花、車箱裏也有許多彩色紙花和紙條掛得挺美麗的、</p>
<p>全車三百多來賓的飲食、由杭州最大的天香樓承包、老闆也穿着待者的服裝在車中照料、每客每餐洋六角、每四人一桌、四菜一煖鍋、招待處規定他須採用浙贛鐵路沿錢土產作原料、十三日晚上九時、那一餐晚飯、大家吃得很滿意、十時開車、來賓便陸續進臥車就睡、</p>
<p>每輛臥車裏有兩名車僮、管理舖位門窗厕所等、看他們對乘客的使喚都那麽有禮貌地接受、就知道是受過相當訓練的、他們全部是三十個人、在這列專車上服務的計十八人、他們大都是浙江口音、年紀自十六到二十五歲不等、穿着黃呢的制服、帽子上也有「飛輸」的帽徽、精神和體格都很好、他們的月薪是十元到十五元、而且不准收受旅客的小賬、浙贛鐵路公司方面、也還不放棄繼續敎育他們的義務、現在分別在江邊。金華。玉山。等處設立員工子弟學校、使他們有受課的機會、</p>
<p>拂曉車過江山</p>
<p>車子駛得很穩速、一夜輪聲伴着許多大小車站和秀美的山水過去了、一月十四日晨、天氣陰霾、列車停在江山車站、從臥舖上伸首向窗外瞭望、遠山雖還是那麽靑靑的、近處却只見高低起伏的赤黃的土崗、山區矮屋盈盈、三五村童、在那裏對這業已常見的火車還兀自發怔、物質文明、畢竟還沒有澹透這古國——卽使在江浙文化之邦、</p>
<p>車遇江山、山水完全失去像杭州附近那　雲秀之氣、從這裏起直到江西省界的玉山迤西一帶、便是一年前輯東赤匪時來遊擊的地方、在各個山頭和要隘、便不時看到使赤匪不能在江西立足的碉堡、現在這裏已經肅淸、這些碉堡、只成為這裏寂寞山林的點綴品了、</p>
<p>玉南沿綫景色</p>
<p>九點半到玉山、這是原來杭江鐵路的終點、再過去就是玉南段起點的玉山了、玉山車站佔地很大、支路也多、將來一定可成為信河上游的最大貨品集散車站、站上職工、在列車進站時、燃放爆竹甚多、並且在車站西面鐵道上建立了一座綵樓、讓第一列火車從那下面穿過、駛上最近完工的玉南段、</p>
<p>十一時許到上饒、這裏曾三次為赤匪佔領、地方所受的損失很大、人口巳由三十萬激减到二十四萬、主要的產物、是茶葉·紙。夏布。等、過去每項曾年銷達五十萬元、現在已有今非昔比之威、上饒及其附近的玉山·廣豐、鉛山·弋陽。橫峯·等縣、每縣境內、的有碉堡三百座、六縣幾達二千座、這一帶常常幾十里不見人烟、卽使有、也只見幾間破敗得不堪的土屋、有些連窗戶也沒有、墻上也還留着赤匪當時所寫的大字標語、去年玉南段工程、在這裏遇到很大的阻礙、其一、遭遇了三十年來未有的霖雨、影響工作、其二、赤匪流散在這裏還很多、時常侵入路工的宿所、殺死從赤區裏逃出來被他們認為反動的難民、要挾着招募來的路工到赤區裏去、加以「大兵之後、必有凶年」、又逢着很强烈的流行性的瘧病、因此、在這段裏犧牲的路工、不下二千多人、</p>
<p>上饒西二十三公里沿鐵路的地方、有一處呌做坑口的煤礦、該礦煤層雖多陋劣、大洞上層、却有優良的煤、可作機車用媒、和普通機爐及打鐵之用、有開採的價値、煤錢長度、據現在的估計、的二千七百公尺、煤層厚度三公尺、可採深度數為七百十九公尺、可採得的煤量的五百二十九萬九千七百四十九公噸、假如每天產三百噸、可支持五十年、該路已經籌劃加以開採、供給本路的應用、</p>
<p>過橫峯·弋陽。後到貴溪。車站南二十五公里、便是所謂道敎的發源地龍虎山、道敎祖師張道陵的故居就在那裏、貴溪附近、又有一座大橋、在該路橋梁工程上、僅决於梁家渡附近的大橋、有十三孔、長三百九十公尺、造價近五十萬元、</p>
<p>夜深到達南昌</p>
<p>過此、天又入暮、但每到一站、必有人燃爆竹歡迎、也必有軍警在車站附近放哨警衛、直到晚間十時、南昌的燈火才在車窗外望見、招待處早已在前兩站用長途電話和南昌方面接洽好、安排全車來賓分借各大旅館下榻、</p>
<p>快近三十小時的長途車行、終於在十時半告一結束、列車在軍樂和爆竹的交響中、駛進南昌車站、江西省政府主席熊式輝以下政黨各界要人、浙贛鐵路人員、當地新聞記者等二百餘人、羣集月台歡迎、黃紹竑曾養甫等、便首先下車、受軍容很盛的當地軍隊的敬禮、</p>
<p>出站後、卽分乘公路汽車向指定旅館下榻、各人均已困憊不堪、倒身便入夢境、記者在一月十四日下午、在車中分訪浙江省政府主席黃紹竑、及鐵道部决長曾養甫二氏、據黃談、關於浙江地方行政、本人打算提高縣政府的權力、現在正在試騐時期、所以不能各縣同時開始的原故、正如家長對於子弟、其能自立者、讓他自立、如尙不能自立者、家長當然仍須監護、繼談及時局問題、黃謂二十九軍與華北問題、可以舉一例為證、如南宋的滅亡、後世人都責備秦檜主和、然岳飛主戰、亦未必定能戰勝金兵、且南宋滅亡、還在秦檜死後百年、責任實不在秦檜及宋高宗、而在高宗以後的幾位昏庸的君主、華北問題、也可用一例看法、西南决無毀滅國家之意、國事若能從大處遠處着想、無事不可解决、政治問題、如環境良好、卽可迎刃立解、關於蒙古問題、他說、雲王年邁力衰、頭腦昏庸、不足有為、惟德王野心甚大、故蒙古問題、甚是複雜云云、</p>
<p>據曾養甫談、「浙贛鐵路以杭州為起點、續展至玉山、再展至南昌、到萍鄉接株萍鐵路而與粵漢路聯絡、東面可以通達上海、南面可以直趨廣州、故南萍段開工與玉南段通車、將同日舉行典禮、南萍段建築費一千八百萬元、和玉南段相仿、向上海銀行團借一千萬元、德南奧脫華爾夫公司借八百萬元、已經在去年四月裏簽定草約、所以成立借欵、可以沒有問題、浙贛鐵路除杭玉段用三十五磅輕軌外、這次完成的玉南段、完全採用六十五磅重軌、希望能一勞永逸、但因鐵重關係、杭玉段車輛、可開到南昌、玉南段車却不能開入杭玉段、預定今年內將杭玉段改鋪重軌、到明年錢江鐵橋·南萍段·及粵漢路通車後、全國各路、就可以直接通車了、浙贛鐵路、並打算改用柴油機車、縮短行車時間、俾可在上午七時由杭州開車、當日下午五時卽可抵南昌、現在路基還沒有堅實、一切又都在草創時代、同時目前尙無此需要、為行車安全計、所以列車開得比較慢一些、</p>

<p>主席致詞</p>
<p>行禮如儀、主席孔祥熙致開會詞、略謂、（一）致謝諸同情人士、諸位先生、諸位女士、今天是本會舉行第七届年會的日子、承蒙諸位的光臨與參加、實在使本席以及本會的同人、覺得非常地振奮、非常地感激、本會成立於民國十七年四月四日、到了現在、已經有了七年多的歷史、在最初的時候、本會的工作、多半灵力於救濟兒童、可是到了現在、我們的工作、日益加多、現在總事務所、共分爲（一）總務、（二）救濟、（三）保障、（四）衛生、（五）敎、育道五組、另外有還（1）慈幼診疗所、（二）慈幼托兒所（三）慈幼敎養院、（四）慈幼病察養院、（五）闡北平民敎養院、這五個附屬的機關、爲兒童治病、進行各種爲兒童謀福的實際工作、這比較從的、眞可以說是大有天淵之别了、不過本會之所以能表現這些許的成績、實在多是出於社會上許多同情人士的恊助、他們的精神、拿他們的時間、拿他們的金錢、從各方面來扶持本會、所以本會才能够有今天、鄙人黍爲本會的會長、並且又是當初發起人之一、所以對於這一些始終扶持本會的朋友他門、不得不表示最誠懇的感激、不得不表示最虔誠的敬意、（二）慈幼事業、是救國的事業、諸君、回想到當初的時候、鄺富灼博士·羅運炎博士·郭秉文夫人·丁淑静女士·王立明女士·高鳳池先生·和兄弟這幾個人、爲什麽要發起一個中華慈幼恊會呢、不用說、我們自然是要藉着這個團體、來進行慈幼的事業的、不過在這個地方、就要請諸位注意、我們來進行慈幼的事業、絶對不是把牠當做一種慈善的事業來辦理的、乃是把牠當做一種社會的救國的事業來辦理的、慈善的事業、自然是值得贊許的、不過那到底是屬於消極的而不是屬於積極的、至於本會所進行的事業、雖然也有一小部份是屬於消極性質的、譬如救濟各地的災童、拯救被虐待的婢女等等、但是大部份地事業、却多是屬於積極性質的、譬如提倡兒童的健康、提倡兒童的敎育、提倡父母的敎育、提倡以最新的科學方法、來敎養全國的兒童等等、本會的希望、不僅要使全國的兒童、能够免於災難、能够免於虐待、並且要使全國的兒童、都能够有健全的身體、都能够有健全的思想、好去創造一個健全的中華民國、這樣説來、本會所進行的事業、自然是一種遠大的、救國的事業、而不僅僅是一種消極的慈善事業、提倡兒童幸福、自然是我們的目的、但是我們的最後目的、却是藉着提倡兒童幸福、而去促成中華民族的幸福、而去完成中華民國的新建設、這一點、是我願意在本届舉行年會的時候、向諸位鄭重表明的、我想諸位對於這一點也是一定能够、加以同情與贊許的、（三）世界各國對於慈幼事業之重視、一個國家的基礎、自然是在乎人民、但是若在個國家先没有健全的兒童、試問將何從産生健全的國民呢、更何從産生健全的國家呢、從此、我們就可以知道、倘若我們想要建設一個健全的國家、尤非得先培養健全的兒童不可、換一句話說、我們就非得先來完成慈幼的事業不可、現代世界各强國、對於慈幼的事業、無不極力加以重視、如他們所知道的、在美國有兒童局、在奥國有兒童保護局、在法國有兒童保護課、在意大利有母子保護事業總會、在蘇俄有母子保護事業總部等等、世界各國的政府、除了設立儿童保護的機購外、又先後制定、並頒布了很多的兒童保護法律、如在英國有兒童法·美國有兒童保護法·法國有兒童養育法·德國有兒童裁判法·蘇俄有母性與兒童法·意大利有母性保護法·日本有少年法·比利時有兒童保護事業統一條例等等、别的國家、對於慈幼事業、可說是非常地重視、再回頭看看我們的國家、是怎麽樣呢、人家所以强、我們所以弱、其原因即在於此、最近蘇俄的史丹林、已經把全國的兒童、都編入兒童團與靑年團、德國的希特勒、已經把全國的兒童、都編入孩童隊與靑年隊、意大利的墨索里尼、已經把全國的兒童、都編入巴里把與先鋒隊、這種事實、也是我們中國辦理慈幼事業的人們之所以應加注意的、歐洲大戰後、德國的興登堡總統、在國會内提出新預算、要在兒童身上、多用些錢、他鄭重地說道、[在世界大戰中、我們已經失去了一切的東西、如今我們絶對不可以再失去了我們的兒童、]連想到我們中國、在過去的五十年中、已經失去了許多的土地、失去了許多的榮譽、如今我們豈可再失去了我們的兒童、爲了我們的兒童、我們是應該多化幾個錢的啊、（四）結論、今天是本會舉行第七届年會的日子、本會深願藉此時機、對於過去、加上一番深刻的反省、對於將來、加上一番深刻的奮勉、同人等自知見聞有限、能力有限、所以很願意接受一切同情人士的批評與指敎、還要請求今天在座的諸位能不吝賜正、不吝指示、那就是本席與本會同人之所極力盼望的了、</p>
<p>許氏演辭</p>

<p>優游乙勝震旦…五比二</p>
<p>東華乙勝阿佩隆…九比三</p>
<p>靑華勝友聲…五比二</p>
<p>優游乙勝震旦　字穌盃次賽、優游對震旦昨日下午三時會師於虹口公園、震旦係中西健兒混合而成、優游則爲比盃賽中勁旅、故昨賽演出頗精采、上半時震旦因中軍羅幹斯未下場、優游得連下四城、下半時震旦雖扳回二球、惜因失球太多、無濟於事、結果五對二優游淘汰震旦、</p>
<p>東華乙勝阿佩隆　字林杯賽、東華乙對阿佩隆、咋日下午三時交鋒於膠州路膠州公園、東華自初級杯失敗於優游而遭洶汰、乃於字林杯出全力應戰，故昨日賽來、全軍用命、合力攻守、異常賣力、上半時雖係逆風佈陣、尚能攻進四球、下半時順風列營、自然阿佩隆更覺不支、結果九對三東華凱旋、</p>
<p>清華勝友聲　字林杯賽靑華對友聲、昨日作戰於虹口第一球塲，上半時靑華戈錫佐罰進十二碼一只、以一對○佔先、下半時友聲陳言造成和局、未幾戈錫佐在二十碼外打破友聲之門、李松筠又以二對二造成平局、如後清華戈謝林三前鋒各人馬上立功、結果靑華以五比二大勝友聲、</p>

<p>麥令勝滬江　滬江之敗、實由於氣力不支及後勁不足所致、蓋上半時中滬江表演極佳、着着佔先、且以二十比十八獲得勝利、惜後半時中力不從心、遂爲麥令乘機而起、乃一瀉千里、幾至不可收拾之局面、總結果成六六比廿九</p>
<p>麥令擲罰犯分　滬江擲罰犯分</p>
<p>海賊勝東華　開始之初、東華聲勢頗盛、馮念華屢中告的、相差最多時、爲十六比七至斯海賊乃易長人萊茵上場、果然形勢爲之一變、海賊緊緊相遜、酣戰至上半時終了、成十九比十九平平、下半時內、海賊鋒茫漸露、東華亦極力振作、雙方戰來、至爲緊湊、入後東華更取半守半攻之策略、海賊雖勇、得分亦殊不易、迨時間終了、成四十三比三十四、東華以九分受挫、</p>
<p>海賊擲罰犯分　東華擲罰犯分</p>

<p>華昆蘭是龐韜摩覺得唯一可以信托在他「店　做事的人，於是他敎昆蘭怎樣尋蛋，把它們安全交出來，只消有一個蘋果或一個棗子作勞力的代價已覺得滿足了。在唐恩顯出異樣神情的星期日的翌晨，昆蘭貢獻出他一决大素所得的勞績，對他的東家說道：</p>
<p>「只有兩個。」</p>
<p>「一天不如一天；眞可惡的老母雞，我從沒有見過，」韜摩咆哮着，想到全盛時常常有六固可收使他笑臉常開，眞是不堪回首。「啊放它們在我的帽子裹，給我一點鉛粉筆，我穗得要把它們記下來的。」</p>
<p>昆蘭於是爬上一個大笆斗，往機器裹的頂上一望，這裏有韜摩放着的紙筆。昆蘭說道：「這裹也有不少錢呢。」</p>
<p>「不，沒有的。我那裹會把錢亂放，」韜摩回答道。</p>
<p>「我看見它們－一，四，八，兩塊洋鈿」昆蘭執着說，他還沒有能將數目字弄個淸楚。</p>
<p>「你眞是一個討厭的小把戲！」韜摩說了便自己爬上梯子去取鉛粉條，然而幾乎又跌了下來，因爲他眞箇看見四塊四開洋亮晶晶排列着，上面放着一點紙寫明是給「龐韜摩」的，以免有什麼錯誤。</p>
<p>「天翻地覆！」韜摩喊道，於是拾了起來，立即衝進大屋子裏去，發在似地亂喊着，「一切都好了！錢已有了！乃德在那裹？」</p>

<p>紗　市頗堅、局勢良好、海外棉業情形穩定、人心益挺、且邇來證券步步下游、據市場上言、恐有利息減輕一說、一般神經過敏者、對於物價、更有進一步的看漲希望、人氣尤昂、市盤緩步上騰、</p>

<p>二十四年份轉眼過去、此一年中呢絨市况之變邊、亦頗可觀、茲將始終略述一過、以備內外行之參考也、</p>
<p>一月　因値舊歷總結賬期近、銀根明暗均緊、所放之賬、絕難收淸、較之二十三年、大打折扣、南京漢口二地客賬更形惡劣、洋服帮退票甚夥、呢絨隨亦相繼落令、祇人字呢搜羅殆盡、獨見飛漲、一〇〇五之十八及二十四顏色馬褲呢、亦暢銷增價、大衣呢類最為受虧、因天氣和暖、不類隆冬、銷路呆滯、致擱存甚夥、</p>
<p>二月　紅盤開價甚平、大多數悉比上月份收盤價為便宜、祇决號人字呢及斜花羽紗二種堅昂、其他一律下降、本街元寳生意、則比往年為順利、因紅盤開價平準、免却一番討價還價之惡習慣、直貢呢素嗶嘰、大半已被日貨所打倒、西貨素嗶嘰、雖價賤亦不易出手、</p>
<p>三月　本月份呢絨交易大盛、本街門莊帮洋服　鞋帽作場等、及北平·天津·青島·漢口·南昌·長沙·貴陽·京滬杭甬路諸大小客邦、統有大批採　、祗四川邦進胃仍鈍、然大川邦則亦略有點綴、素　　·元直貢·素華特呢·法蘭絨西裝呢·中　　　海令蓬·花洋布羽紗·等走銷均大暢盛、單面開水米市銷亦活、惜貨貸價反較二月份為尤疲、其故仍為市面不振、銀根緊急、兼先令轉長、揭價成本互有大小、以致又造成競爭而　亂之局面矣、</p>
<p>四月貨價十跌八九、同業中均不希望上漲、大半祗願保持穩定、即算幸事、暑天需銷之夏貨、雖相　上市、但市情仍極惡劣、放　收回頗覺艱難、西服飾退票充斥、淸理收閉者本外埠續有見　、銀根之緊、營業之難、至此為極、</p>
<p>五月　呢絨各貨銷路雖甚旺盛、而貨價則反頻頻下跌、其主要原因、仍為銀根緊急、貨色充斥、明　美　中外銀行倒閉、使商業人心更為不安、新貨到本便宜、老貨進本昂　　靑黃不接、價遂紊亂、派力司凡立丁跌勢特重、榮泰標準老牌一五三三〇立憲圖直實呢、忽亦搗亂、其故為棧房失火、有拍賣叫出所致也、</p>
<p>六月　天氣炎熱、夏令白貨、統皆及時旺銷、條子白　　花條白直黃派力司等走銷特盛、黃斜紋紗斜膠布·麻膠布羽紗呢珠　紗等、出路亦暢、而價仍下跌、祗日貨下檔白　　與三十六寸</p>
<p>七月　中旬前交易尚佳、紗毛　織之灰白　色、走銷皆盛、中旬後交易驟淸、同業中多晒　歇夏、此乃歷年來潯　中應有之舉也、</p>
<p>八月　秋冬呢絨各貨、多相繼開盤、其所開價目、悉比二月份春盤為允廉、此皆時局環境所遇成、非海上一隅之關係、四川帮首先購辦、日貨呢絨到銷兩旺、英德各貨、均大受打擊、已占踞重要地位、繼榮泰後裁呢絨部又有著名老行之泰和一家</p>
<p>九月　呢絨市面大有進展、本街各帮咸有大量買賣、洋行出貨甚為擁擠、郵包寄遞大增、惜貨價依然下降、直貢呢馬褲呢允甚、紗平厚呢波　商行、現貨售開甚眾、賣方統抱寗願削價而不放　為宗旨、</p>
<p>十月　呢絨各貨、本客帮統均及時暢銷、男女色中西裝各貨、逐日齊有大宗交易、然與往年比較、則减少不小、因貨價降落故耳、二十五日起、呢被貨價、為先令暴縮、關金標金狂漲、成本扯價　昂、因之多紛紛喊漲、然除大衣呢及黃呢平厚呢外、多虛張聲勢而巳、絲光羽紗馬棕緞、因人造絲與紗毛原料激貴、故亦實行激漲、東貨薄花呢中厚嗶嘰及波蘭大衣呢黃呢平厚呢等、趨勢均優、西貨海力斯及高條花呢盛行特甚、服裝帮大有需要、邊頭有字套頭花呢、風行一時、</p>
<p>十一月　貨價大有變動、政府於四日行法幣、人心靈動、毛織貨價紛紛續漲、賣方因血本關係不漲不肯脫手、買方則隨用隨買、波蘭貨所漲允甚、日貨亦因幣價關係而狂漲、國貨亦因原料昂貴而報漲、交易因大家俱須國幣、支票（因退票太多）賣方均不允通融、因之祇有零售而少　批、月末天氣突冷、實銷大增、平厚呢中厚嗶嘰馬褲呢雙面黃駱駝羢人字呢等交易仍盛（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c185">我將來做怎樣的人？ <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 武進縣立渡橋小學校周慶衍</p>
<p>我是一個窮苦的小學生。我的家在一所巍峨的工廠（織布廠附近。我爸爸便在這工廠裏做工，我們一家的生活，全賴他一個人。</p>
<p>我的爸爸有壯健的體格，紫銅色的皮膚，粗大的臂膀，每天東方還沒有發白的時候，就起身，匆匆的往工廠裏去，開始他一天的工作。</p>
<p>那工廠大極了，有男女工人三千餘。我也曾去參觀過每一個工作室裏，整齊地排列着幾十架機器，以同樣的方式運動：皮帶急速地迴旋着，輪軸不決地轉動著，機聲隆隆的響着似乎在奏着偉大的曲調，使我不由得心曠神怡。爸爸說：「靠自己勞力吃飯的人，真是世界上最高尙的人，最榮譽的人。明年你畢業後，我將　你入工廠做工，因為我相信將來的世界，總有不勞働沒有飯吃的一天！」我聽了這句話，身心有無上的舒暢榮幸，頓時對於「勞働」「力量」「事業」，發生了無限的興趣。同時，我將來事業方向的燈塔，已透了微微的一些光綫。</p>
<p>現在，我是六年級了，是我求學的最後時期。因為畢業後，就要到那活躍生動的世界裏去生活，那一雙能幹的臂膀，此後就要運用了。不過，照我的體格，和現在的環境，以及種種，我決不可能做一個普通工人，非努力不可。因為在這二十世紀的時候，發明家不是大學生，留學生，而是工人。愛迪生小時候是賣報童子，富蘭克林幼時也是印刷工人，但因種種努力，畢竟成了大發明家，為人類造福。我一定努力，決定努力！立誓努力！把那機械的原理研究得瞭如指掌，希望成為一個大工程師。</p>
<h3 id="c186">增進兒童觀察力的遊戲法 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>現在我來說一個和兒童很有益並且很有興趣的遊戲法，無論在什麽地方，都可以試行，或在乘火車旅行的長途中，或在海濱和林間閒遊的靜坐中，或在天雨坐在家裏的無聊中，只要有三五個兒童，便能利用這個方法，神益兒童，並且可使兒童們歡樂，而不感覺厭倦。這方法很是簡便的，只須隨手取雜物若干種，放在兒童面前，叫他們注意望一下，然後即用一塊大布或方巾把物遮蓋住，叫每個兒童就他所能記憶的物名，一一寫下，自然誰寫對的最多，算誰勝利，這個方法，可訓練兒童的記憶力。因為記憶力是愈訓練愈有長進的，同時又能增進他們的觀察力，使他們對於隨時所見的各物，都能凝神注意。在我們領兒童到城市中大街上散步的當兒，也能作這個遊戲法；譬如走過一家水果店，你可叫兒童在一望之後，背轉身把所見的各種果名，一一報出。假使是一個雜貨店，那末，可叫他報出玻璃窗裏所陳列的各種物品。假使遊逛公園，可叫他報出在數分鐘前所走過的地方看見什麽花？什麽樹？什麽鳥？什麽屋？再詳細點，可叫他把各物的形象顏色種種，分別說明，這個方法可逐漸推及各種景象，和人生的種種經歷。</p>
<p>現在已有些學校用這個方法增進學童的記憶力，培植學童的觀察力，而得到良好的效果。</p>
<p>尼特氏所著的「思的技術」一書中，曾寫記名畫家嘉靜氏的兒子所說的話，他說：「我的爸爸常領我到鄉間去散步，我兩人遇到美景的時候，便止步靜觀數分鐘，然後我兩人都背轉身來，互試在此須臾觀察中所印入腦中的美景特點」。他又說：「爸爸的觀察力和記憶力，都很高強，往往平常人所不能觀察到的各點，他老人家在幾個月後還牢牢記著，一點也不錯訛」。這種特性，不是天生成的，也不是一天可得到的，全在平時練習觀察力，久而久之，成為習慣，凡一切天然的美景奇觀，和吾人四周形形色色有興趣的各點，過目之後，便能深深地印在腦中；那結果可以使經騐日見豐富，學業容易成功。反之，倘若缺乏這種練習，對於所見的各種事物，卻如雲烟過眼，絲毫不能印入腦中，因為偶然所見到的事物，最容易忽略而　，所謂「心不在焉，視而不見，聽而不　」。世界上有很多的學者，都是利用他平日觀察事物所得的經騐而成名的，所以我們對於兒童，當從小訓練他的記憶力和觀察力。</p>

<p>— 陳占謹</p>
<p>近日香港當局組織了一個「報童俱樂部籌備會，」地址亦已定，經費是向各界募捐而來的，預計在陰曆年底以前便可正式成立了。在俱樂部除裝設各種運動和消遣的器具外，並辦一個義務夜校，完全免費招收報童讀書；　　後還可</p>
<p>小朋友！中國的兒童年的成績可說是沒有什麽，但是在兒童年將完的時候，卻有這個好消息。（但也是外人發起的）我們當然要快樂一下子。所以覺得遺憾的就是：外人先做實地工作，本國人反而落後！而上海也有幾千報童，流浪的報童；為風吹，為雨打；同是中國的人民，他們爲什麽這樣不幸呢？</p>
<p>所以現在聽所有好些人也將發起這種組織，經費也想向各界募集。我在這裏很希望：在將來開始募捐時，小朋友們都竭力勸自己父親和親戚，那麼報童們一定很感謝的。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>這幾天的氣候，不是很冷嗎？啊！小朋友！你們家裏裝火爐麼？唉！你們每年在報上，不是時常看見，有一家人被氣毒死麼？你們可曉得，他們爲什麽會死的呢？我恐怕你們也許答不出呀！這就是缺乏關於煤氣常識的緣故，現在趁此機會，和大家談談。</p>
<p>毒死的主要原因，大多因為火爐沒有管子，煤氣無從出去，於是煤氣就和氧氣化合，成為二氧化碳，又因室中氧氣有限，人呼吸出來又是死氣，所以繼續產生的煤氣，沒有氧和它化合，把室中都變成一氧化碳，但它的性質是有毒的，並且有凝固了，血液失去了血液特色及其本能，自然不會循環，人便死於非命。</p>
<p>小朋友！你們若遇到中毒的人，就應該把中毒的人，拖到曠場上，再用人工呼吸，去救活他，這也是功德無量的事，還有生爐子的室中，一定覺得很乾燥的，那末，你只要在爐子上放一壺水，壺中就有水蒸氣，陸續發出，調和濕度，這是很合於衛生的。我最後希望小朋友們，能解釋給鄰人聽，關於煤氣的常識，使他們都知道煤毒的可怕和解救的方法。</p>

<p>— 季芝</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友：</p>
<p>在這國家多難的時候，我知道你一定能加倍努力的讀書，我還知道你或許天天在寫日記。現在我就想跟你談談寫日記的好處和方法。</p>
<p>日記的好處，我想至少有下面的五點一，　　　　二，修養品性，三，練習作文，四，幫助記憶，五，練習書寫。</p>
<p>日記記　什麽呢？有許多小朋友寫日記時總要說，記些什麽呢？親愛的小朋友！你有沒有這種沒有什麽好寫的感覺嗎？其實日記的題材，到處都有。像：看到的，聽到的，做到的，想到的。祗要加以選擇，都是很好的材料。劃分段落，再加以適當的題目，不就成了一篇很好的日記了嗎？</p>
<p>日記究竟該怎樣寫呢？我以為一，要勤　寫，不可間斷。二，要寫實在的事情，不可空造。三，要仔細寫，不可敷衍。</p>
<p>最後，介紹幾本優良的日記：義華的日記，紀念日日記……閱讀後，定可幫助你的寫作。下次再談吧：祝你進步</p>

<p>— 鼓浪</p>
<p>一天，阿細從學校裏放學回來，對他的媽媽道：</p>
<p>「媽媽？上自然科學的時候，我考了一個第一名」：</p>
<p>媽媽很喜歡的問道：</p>
<p>「阿細！真的嗎？先生問你一個甚麼題目呢：你快快的對我說了吧」：</p>
<p>阿細道：</p>
<p>「先生問我的題目是鴕鳥有幾隻腳，我說有三隻腳」。</p>
<p>媽媽道：</p>
<p>「不對，鴕鳥是兩隻腳，你怎麼會得第一名呢？」</p>
<p>阿細道：「不，我不說謊，我們一班一共有十個人，他們九個都說鴕鳥四隻腳，先生說我比較近些，所以第一名呀」！</p>

<p>— 心青</p>
<p>他老人家瞧了瞧柏德希，便很詫異的站住了，賺到一旁，在溝邊的觀草和蘆葦中跪了下來，眼中含著憐憫的神情，注在柏德希的身上。</p>
<p>同他在一起的，是一個黃髪黑眼而臉色像玫瑰花似的小孩，出世還沒有幾年哩，他在齊胸的矮樹　中，忙忙的跑著說著。一會兒也立住了，很著意的照著那僵臥不動的可憐的大狗。</p>
<p>這就是他們　的第一次會面！小南洛和柏德希。</p>
<p>這一天的結果，便是老達士費了好多的氣力，把那可憐的狗拖到他自己的小屋中區，很小心的救護它，它本來也並沒有甚麼重傷，只為又渴又乏，又受了暑熱，頭腦昏暈，實在受不住了，如今在陰涼的所在一經休息，就回復了原有的體力和健康，它終於在那四條強有力的腿上支撐了起來。</p>
<p>在最初的幾個禮拜中，它覺得疲軟無力，去死不遠；但是它一天到晚沒聽到一句粗暴的說話，也沒有皮鞭和木棍著到它的身上，它所聽得的，只有那小孩子的憐憫的柔聲，它所覺得的，只有那老頭兒的溫慰的撫摩。</p>
<p>在它的病中，這寂寞的老人和那愉快的小孩，便是它最忠懇的看護人。</p>
<p>它在這小屋子裏佔有了一角，有一堆乾草給它做　鋪；他們在黑夜中總得很懇切地聽它呼吸的聲音，知道它仍還活著；到得它氣力回復了一些，能夠發出一聲斷續的吠聲來時，他們直快樂得大笑起來，以至於樂極而哭，因為他們知道它確是復原了；小南洛高興得甚麼似的。採了許多小菊花做成一個花圈套住它的頭頸把他那鮮紅的嘴唇和它接吻。</p>
<p>於是柏德希又活潑起來了，仍然是身強力大像往日一樣；它那一雙熱烈的大眼睛中，現出很詫異的神色，怎麼如今竟沒有人打它罵它了；它的心中感覺到一種偉大的愛，這是它所從來沒有的。</p>

<p>— 林蔭</p>
<p>從神農氏定了「日中為市」的辦法以後，社會上便有了交易的時間和地點。可是，那時的人民還有一種麻煩，覺得拿貨物換貨物，既不便當，而且物價有高低，交換起來，有的吃虧，有的便宜。所以神農氏又想出一種交易的中間物，來代替貨物的價值，那時用的是貝殼皮革（圖一）就是貨幣的起源。</p>
<p>後來，大家覺得貝殼皮革不便，就又想出用金屬來鑄造貨幣，這便是貨幣的進化，有的刀形，有的中方外圓，有的像鐘的樣子。（圖二）在黃帝時代起，一直用到漢朝。</p>
<p>經過許多次的改良，從貨幣本身的價值，規定貨幣代表的價格，譬如銅鑄成的小錢，銀鑄成的角子，大洋，價值高。（圖三）並且規定各種貨幣的使用價值。我國是以銀圓為主體的，稱做銀本位，像英國是以金磅為主體的，稱為金本位。</p>
<p>可是金屬的貨幣，還有一種缺點。他的分量太重，攜帶不便，倘若進出的數量很多，　起來又費去不少時間；所以後來又發明紙幣，俗語所說的鈔票。（圖三）這種既輕便，且便於收藏，是貨幣中最方便的一種。</p>
<p>現在政府為統一幣制，救濟金融起見，已規定中央，中國，交通，三銀行的紙幣為法幣。就是說，這三家銀行的鈔票是國家所承認使用的貨幣，銀圓已經禁止通用了。並且統一貨幣的掉換是每小洋一角值錢二百五十文，法幣一元可換小洋十二角，或錢三千文，這樣一來，貨幣的使用，　　　　　的　經了。</p>

<h3 id="c194">佛教的產生和其作用 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 靜哉</p>
<p>佛敎是反婆羅門敎的一種宗敎思想，但它並不是和婆羅門敎完全無關係的，並且我們必須從印度的社會集團關係的變遷上去觀察，才能明白它的產生和其教義之作用。在紀元前一千年前後，正是阿利耶民族征服印度的時代，印度的大史詩摩訶婆羅多十萬頌和羅摩衍拏二萬四千頌，便是記述這一時期之戰爭史事的。呂　的印度佛教史略說，阿利耶民族征服印度的開始，卽發生了崇拜自然物之自然神教，而婆羅門卽為一司祭者，創婆羅門教。婆羅門亦「歌詠天象地儀之雄偉備至，所崇拜之神靈以自然物之常體為始，漸信其有道德的性質，能司賞罰予奪，同時又以哲學思想為涵養。」如此則婆羅門敎實淵源於原始的自然拜物敎，所謂四吠陀的敎義本源亦出源於此。可是，阿利耶民族征服印度土住民族後，自己卽變成了統治的貴族，所以它所信奉的宗敎也漸變為統治的宗敎；甚至由於它居於統治地位和普遍發展的結果，其奉信之祭司僧侶也自然成為一特殊階級，變成了最高的統治者。然而也正因為阿利耶族和婆羅門敎僧侶變成了統治者以後，他們再不如以前侵入印度時那樣需要向外戰爭殺伐，只在要求如何維持其統治與現有地位，甚至只在追求其安樂的生活和精神的救度與解股，所以婆羅門教也逐漸變更其宗敎思想，由自然拜物敎轉變其宗教敎義，使其研究「愈進於高尙幽玄」，「兼哲學宗敎之性質」，思「窮宇宙之秘奧而出生死之迷界」，「立深邃之學說」，有趨懷思想者，又有誠實於解脫之道而為隱遁者。</p>
<p>但是，阿利耶民族旣以異族而統治印度，自己成為最高的統治的貴族，奉信它的宗敎之僧侶亦同樣成為最高的統治者了，所以在印度的土住的貴族，也不免淪為被統治者，居於决等地位，當時的印度社會遂分成四個等級，阿利耶族貴族和婆羅門僧侶自居於最上層的統治地位，自然是滿意於現狀的。但在印度的土住者由貴族到奴隸，乃至阿利耶族及婆羅門敎的下層社會，却都是不能滿足現狀而反對現狀的，這裏常然存在着一種複雜的集團鬥爭的實質，反婆羅門敎便如此成為廣大的思想，佛敎敎義之勃興卽代表這一反婆羅門敎的潮流。這一運動就是被統治的貴族也是參加的，甚至還是領導者，所以釋迦牟尼乃出生於印度非阿耶族的釋加族，而他的地位則又是該族中的國王王子，這正証明常時的部分貴族也是常時統治者的反抗者。不過那時印度的社會經濟乃是一種奴隸社會的經濟基礎，一方面奴隸羣的反抗，共自身是不能走上有規津有組織的反抗活動道路的，另一方面則在貴族領導之下也不能放心他們起來作行動上的實際上的反抗，以至動搖到他們自己的地位，所以那種僅僅在意識上作消極反抗的玩意兒最合於他們的需要，而佛敎的敎義就是以此種企圖為其中心思想的。</p>
<p>我們懂得了佛敎發生的當時之印度的集團關係和集團心理，則其所以發生佛敎的迎動的原因自然是已能明瞭，同時，就是對於它的敎義也是可以懂得它的眞意及其作用的。佛敎的敎理是認一切皆無常的，現實世界是苦的。現實世</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>界之所以苦就苦於無常，因為無常卽變動不居，變動不居卽發生苦。就人生說，生，老，病，死，就是變動，所以它以生老病死為苦。超脫生老病死才是苦的解脫，卽超脫變動而能不感受任何變動才是解脫。這種敵視變動的思想，以變動為苦的思想，老實說就是當時的貴族自身的恐怖和悲鳴。因為他們戀戀於舊日的地位，他們自覺從前是統治者，現在是受了壓迫，所以他們很悲傷他們的地位的變壞，而欲求得一個有常的不變，自然會敵視這變和無常，並以此為苦。在他們看來，變就是空，因為有的東西一變就成為無，他們原來的優越變成不優越，過去的一切在變動中就失掉了，所以他們的哲學卽認變動的東西是幻是空。現實的萬有都是變的，所以萬有皆空，四大皆空是他們的至極的認識論哲學，他們以此而否認物質世界，認一切香，味，觸，覺的可威性的東西都是空的。他們雖以一切皆空為其認識的基點，但他們却並不以這空為滿足的。空起於變，他們就得求得一個不變永不變的東西來填補他們的空，於是便把外界歸之於完全由意識所起。物成於意識，變動的世界亦成於意識，我們要忘掉一切外界的變動，要不為變動的外界所染所苦，則惟有做到不着意，做到領悟那如不動的眞如，如此格去物慾與現實世界的貪戀，掃除外緣與俗識以明心見性，這便可以得着解脫，也就是他們的逃避苦惱的方法。佛敎的修行卽以此為目的，所以它的苦行是出世界的。</p>
<p>不過上述的佛敎敎義是佛敎的唯識論派大乘敎的最高的正宗敎義，而小乘的敎義則停留於出生入死的因果輪迴之中，在一般有高深的佛學思想的人是鄙棄它的。其實在我們看來，大乘派的佛敎雖是正宗本色的佛敎，但它却是貴族們的敎義，因為雖然他們對舊有地位之被變更而表示反對，他們並反對繼續的敎化，而以超脫變的世界達於坐悟心靈的眞如作為解脫，但這正是還有飯吃和有福享的人所做的事，並且他們更不願意因果報應輪迴之說，也不願意死老病，因為他們不願在來世來受那時曾作過剝削者的後果，亦不願他們的地位再在輪迴中變壞。至於小乘派則不然，雖其消極的出世思想仍根源於佛敎，受了貴族們的麻醉和欺騙，但貴族們的敎義到了他們手裏却變了質。因為他們希望今生修練種下好因，來生能輪迴轉到上層階級的地位去獲得善果。因此大乘小乘足以此表現出一種集團不同的理想，包含有集團對立的意義於其中的。</p>

<h3 id="c195">介紹「康健世界」 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 全淸</p>
<p>本埠同孚路二一四弄一四號康健世界社發行，每期定價五分，全年十二期五角</p>
<p>在我們的接連幾個「雜誌年」中，的確出現了不少的雜誌；而且，在這中間，無論是一般的綜合的雜誌或特殊的專門雜誌，其數量都是在增加的。但在這各種各樣的雜誌中，如你要想找一本實際有用的，通俗的，關於我們的康健的讀物，那我除請你去看最近出版的「康健世界」外，便沒有別的更能中你的心意的刋物可以介紹給你了。</p>
<p>在「康健世界」的發刋詞中，表示了這刋物的六大使命：　閘揚康健的眞義；　研究康健的學術；　提倡康健的運動；　介紹康健的新聞；　傳佈醫藥的智識；　實現快樂的人生。據該刋的一二兩期的內容看來，它對於上列的幾大使命確已實行了不少。關於閘揚康健的眞義及康健的方法的，在創刋號中有康健齊夫的「從生存慾說到康健與民族氣運」，知難的「健康敎育與人生」，黃寄萍的「戈公振先生的生前衛生談」，在第二期中有逸梅的「李合肥氏的健康談」，周逸民君的「健康上應注意的幾點」……。關於婦女兒童的康健的，在創刋號中有史東的「健康與婦女」，樂天齊夫的「兒童健康的生活」，元問的「兒童衛生上的實際幾要點」，在第二期中有楚耀的「譚分泌多量乳汗法」，這些文字都是非常實際的，任何人看了都可得到許多的益處。關於體育的，有値之的「綱球十傑」（第二期）……等作品。不過，我以為這刋物最好的一部分，對於一般讀者最有益處的一部分，還是要算「醫藥春秋」一欄，這是需要在這裏多說幾句話的。</p>
<p>誠如方便君在「敬吿病家們」（創刋號）和「再吿病家們」（第二期）中所指明的那樣，國內有許多醫藥刋物是「說眞方賣假藥」的，是「設陷穽」以「誘騙廣大病家的洋鈿鈔票」的，是低級的廣吿性質的，這些東西對一般讀者，特別是對於病人，不僅無益，而且有害。而「康健世界」的「醫藥春秋」欄則與這類醫藥刋物絕對不同，這裏的文字不為個人宣傳，不為那些雖然說得很好聽但實際上並無多大效用的藥品作廣吿，它們都是很科學地客觀地研究各種病理，說明各種疾病的預防和治療法，考究某些有關我們康健的食品的性質並說明其用法，而且，這些文字對於我們的實際生活都有很大的關係，都是對於我們有實際效用的。如創刋號中張劍靑醫師的「牛乳與健康」，便是很實際地說明了牛乳的品質及其食法的；又如雨晨的「傷風及流行性感冒」（創刋號），吳宏猷的「閒話白喉」，張劍靑的「談談避孕」，顧保羅的「神經衰弱的不藥療法」（以上三篇載第二期），也都是很科學很切實的東西。假使我們的家庭，我們的自身難免有疾病的遭遇，又假使我們需要喫些滋養品來維持我們的健康，那常常翻閱這樣的「康健世界」，特別是牠的「醫藥春秋」一欄，確是很有益的，因為從此可以得到不少的醫藥衛生的有用知識。</p>
<p>此外，「康健世界」的文字也都很通俗；無論什麽人，只要是識字的，都可看得懂。在這一點上，又可說這刋物是與一般專講學理的全硬性的東西不相同的。</p>

<p>— 堪斯</p>
<p>美國有一個叫做「航業大王」的大來，他所統屬的船隻，據說是遍跡全世界，無論在那一條航綫上都能見到揷有大來公司旗幟的商船。這位大來先生，在一般人的眼中看來，當然要認為是一位非常的人物，可是，在一個資本發達而又是那麽容易產生「　　大王」的美國，要做一位「航業大王」似乎要比在中國容易得多了。中國航業發展至今雖已有近百年的歷史，然因種種關係，直到現在似乎還沒有脫離幼稚時代；再要在這幼稚的航業中成功一個「航業大王」，那種困難的情形，當然是可想而知的。可是，儘管中國整個的航政事業是怎樣的幼稚，而個人成功者却也並不是絕對沒有；譬如像虞洽卿先生，便是一位從事航業的很好的模範人物。</p>
<p>虞氏是鎭海龍山人，十五歲那年從他的故鄉來到上海從事開闢商業的途徑，競競業業地至今已有五十四年之久。在民國二十年間，滬上一般知名之士曾為他舉行過旅滬五十年紀念會來紀念這位非常的人物。記者仰慕虞氏已久，但苦於無緣聆敎；此次承某刋編者徐君以戚誼關係的介紹，才得和這位航業界名人作了一小時的暢談。</p>
<p>是一個星期一的下午，我踏進了三北公司的總理辦公室，虞氏正在低着頭處理他日常的事務；經我把介紹信遞給他看了以後，便很客氣的招呼我坐了下來。</p>
<p>他今年六十九歲，應該是一位龍鐘老態的老人了，可是從那張容光煥發的國字形臉孔和一對炯炯有神的眼睛上看來，似乎還在壯年時代。他說話的聲調還是沒有因旅滬有五十年之久而改變他的鄉音（鎭江口音），不過因為年齡的關係，聽來似乎更較蒼老了。</p>
<p>「虞先生的公事很忙吧？有閒的話，我想請你把你過去的事蹟吿訴我一點；我相信你有很多的經歷，是可以作為一般靑年人的模範的。」我說明了來意。</p>
<p>「每天都不過是做點例行事務罷了，怎麽忙的話倒也說不上的；不過要我說點過去的經歷給靑年人做模範，那是不會有什麽好的材料値得供給你的啊！」</p>
<p>「不必客氣，虞先生！我聽說你有現在的地位完全是從艱難的環境中奮鬥出來的；在這過程中，當然是會有不少的有價値的材料。據說虞先生從前曾在顏料店學過生意，這話可是事實麽？」</p>
<p>「是的。」語調像斬釘截鐵那麽地剛勁，接着閉了一隻眼睛作了一會深切的回憶說：「那是五十多年以前的事了。我學生意的那家顏料店叫做瑞康，是奚潤如先生開設的。當時的規模很小，資本僅有八百兩，店中用的「朝奉」（即店員）也祗有三人，後來我進去了，才一共有四人。我做的事除了做普通學徒應做的事之外，還兼任跑街的職務，……」</p>
<p>我等他歇了一歇，又接着問：「虞先生當日為什麽獨對顏料業感到興味呢？」</p>
<p>「從鄉裏出來時，我本打算進南市大王廟的一家小錢荘習錢葉；可是，因為還有一個同鄉某君和我同來，一了上海以後，因為當時的環境關係，他不能久候，便由送我們來上海的同族虞　九先生介紹，把他先送進了那家小錢荘，我後來才進瑞康顏料店了。」容光煥發的臉上展開了愉快的笑容，兩手更向袖筒裏縮緊了一下。</p>
<p>「據說先生在進瑞康的上一天，這店的經理當晚上曾夢見了一位赤足的財神，第二天先生進店時，正是天下大雨，凑巧又是脫了鞋襪，經理見了歡喜得不可形容；這事也還實在吧？」</p>
<p>「那也是適逢其會的事；」他說着也忍不住地笑了：「不過我進店那天確是正在落很大的雨，而我脚上穿的又正是僅有的一隻剛上脚的新鞋，當時心裏實在有可惜，所以便把牠連襪子一齊脫下了；這要是在現在交通這麽便利的上海，也許就不會有這種附會的傳說了。」</p>
<p>「不過，據說先生進店的那年就經手賺了二萬多兩；我想，即使那種話是一種「附會其辭」，似乎也不是無因的吧？」</p>
<p>「不！」身子向椅背上仰了一下，似乎對我的話起了些微的反感，接着說：「那種傳說不過是從前老年人的迷信思想；生意賺了錢歸之於神明，失敗了就抱怨自己的命運。在現代的商業上，我們就絕對不能懷有這種思想。一椿事業的成敗自有牠內在的原因和客觀的環境，决不是偶然的獵取或求之於神祗的護助所可獲得的。我進店的那年正是顏料生意大有可為的時候，不過有的人沒有看到這點罷了。所以我進店不久被派充了跑街以後，我便盡量的在職務上努力着。當然囉！有耕耘才有收穫，這是不易的定理，所以在這一年的終局，我努力的結果是獲得了二萬多兩銀子的利潤。」兩個手指在半空中閃了兩下，又揷進袖管裏去了。</p>
<p>「在那一年中，店裏對於先生的勞績總應該有一番很大的酬報吧？」我笑着說。</p>
<p>「你們靑年人總喜歡先生從這方面着想的。不過，照當時的商鋪舊例，學徒年終所得，大都是只有十二元的鞋襪費。我那年就因為經手賺了二萬多兩銀子的緣故，店裏對我却特別客氣，加給了我鞋襪費四十元；這在當時的商界的確要算是創例了。」四個手指伸着像扇子般的對我搖了幾搖，顯着對當時情形很滿意的神氣。</p>
<p>「在瑞康裏大槪是屈就了好幾年吧？」</p>
<p>「十多年了。在那裏的第二年便有一家三泰顏料店想請我去當「朝奉」先生，但是奚先生却不願我離開這裏，自動讓出瑞康脫份兩股給我；當時我自己也不忍離開瑞康，所以我便向各方凑集了二百兩銀子加入股份。自是而後，瑞康的營業一天比一天發達，一年比一年賺錢。在這時，我一面是一個股東，一面又是職員，每到年終總分得一點利潤，同時我個人在社會上也有一點小名氣了。於是我便以在社會賺來的錢仍用之於社會；對於社會的一切事業，祗要是我的能力和財力所能達到的，我總盡量的贊助。」</p>
<p>「放棄顏料業，大槪是在那一年？」</p>
<p>「我經營顏料業有十二年，那時我還祗二十七歲，過了不久，便接受了魯麟洋行的聘請，充任買辦；在那裏也任職了九年，才改入道勝銀行。因為有很多的原因，在道勝祗任事一年，便又加入荷蘭銀行充任買辦；這一次要算是我服務金融界最長的時期，直到一在差不多有三十多年了。」</p>
<p>「虞先生單是做事的年數就已經要比我的年齡大得多了！在這樣一個長時期中還做了其他的事業吧？虞先生從事航業是在什麽時候起始的？」</p>
<p>「哈哈！」他沉思了一下，笑着說：「這說起來，又是幾十年以前的事了。我從事航業的動機也是由於當時的環境所促成的。因為在光緖末葉，一般同鄉往來滬甬經商的，一天比一天增多，當時行駛滬甬航綫的船隻僅有太古的「北京」和招商局的「江天」兩艘，頗有供不應求之勢，而統給的票價又比別條航綫昂貴，一般同鄉大都叫苦連天，任其剝削。往後不久，有法人組織的東方公司的「立大」輪加入行駛，想搶奪太古招商兩家的客運；於是太古和招商便聯合跌價吸收乘客，票價遂由一元跌至五角。這種局面僅相持了一年，三公司復「言歸於好」，將票價恢復到一元的原數，使一般同鄉又感到剝削的苦痛。我見到這種情形，便分向三公司當局接洽，要求統艙的票價永遠不得超過五角，否則，甬人就自創公司購船行駛；可是，往返奔走的結果依然是不着三公司的同情。由此我便深感到外國資本家對中國是祗有盡量地吸收利潤，絕對沒有絲毫的道德可言；如果我們想向他們說話，就祗有先充實自己的力量才有辦法。經過了這一次的刺激，我便决心想組織一個寗紹公司。可是經營輪船業最關重要的工具乃是碼頭，如果沒有碼頭，就猶如患瘋癱的人的脚一樣，徒有外表，實際上是一點也沒有用處。但當時黃浦江沿岸的較好地段都被外商公司「捷足先登」了，寗紹公司的碼頭遂成為了一個很重大的問題。後來沒有辦法，祗得反向日人商租外白渡橋東洋公司碼頭，可是沒有成功；於是再向「三德堂」租借法領館對面的外洋涇橋南首碼頭，又遭挫敗；最後才分向南京兩江總督和北京農工商部請願，並託南通張季直先生帮忙，才算把這重要問題解决了。寗紹公司開始營業時，首先就照統艙票價祗售五角的原則做去；一般同鄉人，因見牠是自辦的航業，又兼票價低廉，也都爭先恐後地來乘寗紹的輪船。這麽一來，引起三公司的嫉視自在意中，於是遂由堅持一元的票價跌到兩角，想藉大資本的力量來打倒寗紹公司。可是，阿拉寗波人的團結性倒也不差，一般同鄉看到這種情形，大家都很熱心的來盡力贊助，捐輸現欵，組織航業維持會；對外由這會賣票，票價一律三角，對公司方面不足之數也由這會貼補，計其費去十幾萬元。從此中國民族的團結力遂為外人所注目了。」</p>
<p>「三北公司想是在寗紹公司成立以後才有的吧？」</p>
<p>「不！」注視了一下壁上的時鐘，接着說：「先有三北，然後才有寗紹。辦三北公司的原因是為了便利龍山的運輸；又因龍山居鎭海，慈谿，餘姚的北鄉，所以才有這三北公司的名稱。最初行駛的輪船祗有鎭北，慈北，姚北三艘；慈北姚北往來於穿山，舟山，沈家門一帶，鎭北則行駛甬江和滬甬綫銜接。當時三北公司的規模極小，資本祗有二十萬元，一切的設備也很簡陋；可是因為龍山的木棉，豆類的出產甚多，所以貨運却很可觀。到民國初年，才接辦英商鴻安輪船公司，這時我便懷有收回航　的觀念。鴻安有「長安」「德興」兩艘輪船及鎭江，南京，蕪湖，九江，漢口各處的碼頭　棧；我接辦以後，又因為其中還有許多英人股東，做事自不免受其掣肘，乃於民國四年籌集了一百萬資本，收買了英人的股權，把公司名稱也改為了鴻安商輪公司。一時「長安」「德興」兩輪及各地碼頭　棧都換了中國商船的旗幟，同時三北公司又在各埠添設分公司，從此，我個人便成為怡和太古兩公司在航運上的勁敵了。</p>
<p>「到了民國七年，又增加了三北公司的資本三百萬元，新添三千噸的海輪二艘，行駛於南北洋航綫；因是這時沿海各口的航權尚在外人的掌握中，如果不設法對抗，將來勢必連領海權都會一齊奉送的。三北公司起先本是個很小的公司，但經我個人和許多同事不斷的努力，才使一班「夜郎自大」的外國航業家的神經不得不震動一下，對三北公司的態度再不敢像以前那樣的不加注意了。現在三北所有的輪船計共二十九隻；在這內港航權取銷的今日，又正是我國航業界應該努力的時候啊！」</p>
<p>「虞先生在中國的航業界中也可以算得是一位「航業大王」了！」</p>
<p>「那還不敢自負，」兩手向我連連搖擺着：「不過我們還是要盡力做去，使已成的事業更加擴大起來，那才算是一個事業者應有的態度呢。」</p>
<p>「是的，像你這種見解，正是一般後學的靑年應該崇奉的箴規。虞先生個人的生活也還是和從前一樣的吧？」對他過去的事業要問的地方覺得實在太多，所以我便在這裏把問題轉到他的私生活方面去了。</p>
<p>「現在的生活形態和過去並沒有什麽大的改變，每天上午九時從家裏出來，先到幾處應該要去的地方走一趟，到十一時左右便到三北公司來辦公了。我對公司裏無論大小事都喜歡過問一下，但因此就有些不明瞭我的人認為我是「獨裁」，其實這不過是幾十年來在努力社會事業中所養成的一種習慣罷了；譬如有時事情較忙，連午飯也是在外面隨便吃點完事的。下午辦公一直要到八點鐘才得回去；如果遇有應酬，那究竟要到什麽時候可以回去，連我自己也無從把握的。」</p>
<p>「那你簡直可說是為社會而生活的。聽說虞先生就是在現在自奉還是很菲薄的，有時到公司裏來，連電梯都不肯乘坐一下，這未免過於刻苦了一點吧！」</p>
<p>「這倒並不覺得刻苦，有時多走走路却也很舒服，好在我脚步還健，就是從底下走到三層樓也還不感到吃力。這種生活在現代的靑年人看來，自不免要認為是過份的節省，可是我却是出於本心的沒有什麽作用。我當時回去，偶然逢到汽車沒有時，我便花十幾個鋼板乘黃包車，從來不願喊傭人代我預備的，因為他們喊的車子的價錢總比我自己叫的要多好幾個鋼板。」</p>
<p>「這麽看起來，虞先生簡直又是一位經濟學者了。…」</p>
<p>「經濟學者倒不是，但不浪費金錢却也是我的信條…」</p>

<p>— 曉天</p>
<p>一說到汽車大王，人們就會提起福特，但在事實上還有安特勒·西托倫（Citroen）也曾經和福特並稱為汽車大王的。距今十年之前，卽一九二五年，西托倫的汽車卽獲得了最高速力的紀錄，使法國汽車製作技術的進步誇耀於全世界。那時，在巴黎，在法國，差不多到處都可見到對於西托倫的祝賀稱頌，到處都可聽到關於他的談話！同時，被稱為巴黎之王的他當然也非常高興，正夢想着巴黎全市市民每一個人都要買他一輛西托倫車。</p>
<p>西托倫車是在大戰中出現的，它比較起原來的魯羅車來，在那時要算是最輕快最時髦，最受人歡迎的，所以在大戰吿終之後，西托倫的財富就要以百萬為單位來計算了；在許多地方他都新設了不少的工塲。他不惜以千萬金的宣傳費來作營業上的競爭，其聲勢之浩大在當時可說是已驚動了全歐羅巴。他的支配力量不僅在歐洲市塲上表現出來，而且還伸張到了亞非兩洲。所謂西托倫車，可說已馳騁全球了。</p>
<p>西托倫生於一八七八年，他的父母</p>

<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>他的名字也還少人知道：但隨着大戰的發展，他的營業日益發達了起來，所謂經濟界的天才，巴黎之王的大名也就隨着傳　各地了。</p>
<p>他本是一個工程師，在一九一二年往游美國歸來後，他就努力設法改良和擴充他的工塲，以至每月可以生產百輛汽車。大戰繼續發展，全世界都聽到了砲火的聲音，這給與了他一個發財的機會；事實上，就在四年的大戰中，他的事業即已得到了驚人的發展。及至一九一九年，他的獨特的汽車已到處可以看到，在一九二五年時，他的聲譽更是可以和汽車大王福特相比了。</p>
<p>在現今的世界中，暴發富的機會自然不會沒有，但暴發富之後也是很容易　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　機會發了大財，做了汽車大王，但在最近的經濟恐慌的大浪中，在資本主義的無情的營業競爭中，他的事業也就遭到了沒落，崩潰，破產的命運了。</p>
<p>在十年前，巴黎夜空中一個高高的廣告塔上，出現了電飾的Citroen字樣，這成為了華麗的巴黎的夜景之一，是所有巴黎的市民都知道的。但現在呢？這的夜空中明亮的電飾文字只是存在於人們的回憶中了，報紙上載出了西托倫公司倒閉的消息，所謂汽車大王西托倫的工塲已被他的債權人所管理，赫赫有名的他也終於成為破產者而去世了！</p>
<p>雖然如此，但西托倫對於社會的貢獻還是很大的，他在事業上那種奮鬥的精神也還是值得我們模倣的。</p>

<p>故鄉的影子在夢魂里久已淡漠了；為了這凋殘的年景，流浪人的心坎里無端的又起了煩悶。實在連年的漂泊使我感到風塵僕僕的疲勞了。於是意識上也懷念到家。</p>
<p>鐵輪在軌道上隆隆地前進時，車廂里無數旅客中，我默默的坐着。</p>
<p>都市的氣息完全落到車尾後了，窗外稀疏的樹條儘向後面奔流，陽光依稀的洒在灰褐的泥土上。車過林畔，那恬靜的叢林中驚起一羣啁啾的麻雀。</p>
<p>這親切而生疏的景物，何等使我留戀啊！</p>
<p>車中人不缺少熱鬧的談話，談到市面衰落的情形，上海倒閉了那幾家店舖，也講到了某小姐的游泳救國。</p>
<p>下車後，照例還要坐兩毛錢的小輪船和四毛錢的人力車，才能回家。大約更近家鄉的緣故，小輪船上有了幾個熟識的老鄉，他們口中仍然銜到四年前我所習見的婁鎮新駛了小汽船，人力車可以用小汽船來代替了。小小地方居然也漸漸與科學接近了。</p>
<p>輪船到了埠頭，我很想坐新駛的小汽船，心上為一種新奇的慾望支配着。</p>
<p>埠頭上和以前一樣汹湧着一羣勞苦羣眾，高呌，揮手，爭奪顧客的行李。</p>
<p>「兩毛錢到婁鎮！兩毛！只兩毛！」清晰的聲音投入我得到耳腔里。</p>
<p>「ｘ先生好久沒回府了！」</p>
<p>原來阿江仍舊在幹他的拉車生涯。為了他殷勤的招呼，使我想坐小汽船的願望重又改變了，盲然的踏上阿江的車子。</p>
<p>阿江老啦，他的背似乎已佝僂得很利害。</p>
<p>輪船上三四十個乘客，大多轉上小汽船了，坐車的只四人，連我。多數車夫都依然站立在埠頭，獃望小汽船冲冲的駛。我們四輛車穿過了熱鬧的城廂，在一片廣漠的綠野中轆轆的前進。</p>
<p>我問阿江說：「婁鎮可有什麽改變？」</p>
<p>「還是那老樣子，只是東街被火燒掉了。除外，就是我們拉車人怕立刻要沒飯吃了。」</p>
<p>「怎麼？你們不還是一樣在拉車嗎？」</p>
<p>「呵，先生，你還不曉得嗎？有了小汽船就沒有我們人力車！」他咳嗆起來，停一停又說：「我們打大减價，兩毛錢到婁鎮，但客人還是去坐一毛五分的汽船，我們也得一毛五分到婁鎮，車力當汽船坐！」</p>
<p>我的心頭立刻被鉛四的沈重的苦痛壓住了。面前展開了一幕壯烈的人力與機器鬥爭的場面。</p>
<p>土岡起伏着。汽船也拐在前面的橫瀝河中了，一縷黑烟，從水面裊向空中，「怪—怪—」的呌了兩聲，寂寞的空中仍只有轆轆的車聲。</p>
<p>「他媽的，李老板這老兒的心活似黑炭，一面租車子給我們。……」</p>
<p>他突然截住了，但無疑的，他是懷着滿腔的憤怒。</p>
<p>「怎麼呢？」我追問着。</p>
<p>「哼，我們向他租了車，他又去駛小汽船了。媽的，車租又不能少一個子兒。」</p>
<p>阿江完全動了感情，咳嗆得更利害了。</p>
<p>車抵家門，我掏出四毛小洋給這滿頭汗珠的人，他似乎驚異我的行為，大約以為四毛代價在現使下已成為多餘的數目了。</p>
<p>那白色小銀餅在他的手掌中停留了三十秒鐘，他才佝僂着背，說了句鄭重的感謝話，走了。</p>
<p>天已遲暮了，黑霧已籠罩在低矮的屋簷上。</p>

<p>過去幾千年來的中國歷史，都可說是由皇家所雇用的文人遵照皇家的意見記載的。所以，你就翻完了什麽二十四史，二十五史，翻完了所有過去中國的史書，能見到的也只是些皇帝貴族的言行，聖主忠臣的攻績，亂臣賊子的罪惡；至於各時代的經濟狀況如何，社會生活怎樣，以及各種歷史事變之社會原因是什麽，那都是見不到的。在這中間，最有趣的是「史家」們的「褒貶」態度；這就是所謂「成者為王，敗者為寇」的態度，在這個態度之下，如「湯放傑」，「武王伐紂」，王莽亡西漢，曹氏篡位，李淵滅隋，乃至黃巢之稱兵，雖然在大體上可說是同一性質的行為，但在那些「史家」們的「褒貶」之下，成功者，其支配力維持得較長久者，即稱之為與仁義之師，為民除害，甚至偽造神話，稱之為「授命於天」，否則便是奸臣篡位弑君，或是賊子謀反作亂。因此，直到現在，我們還不能依據已有的歷史材料，科學地有系統地整理出一部真的中國史來。</p>
<p>當然，在目前情形下，如果誰能科學地有系統地整理出一部中國史來，那他是有很大的功績的。但若還是因襲着過去專制時代那些「史官」們的辦法，採取「成者為王，敗者為寇」的「褒貶」態度，依據「正史」抄出一部中國史來，那這事件不僅做了等於未做，而且還由此表現出了做這事情的人的庸俗，沒有一點新的歷史眼光。可是，做這樣的事情的庸俗者已經有了，那便是王桐齡先生：他的「中國史」便是依據所謂「正史」抄出來的。</p>
<p>說來頗有點嚇人，王桐齡先生的「中國史」總共有四大巨冊，二千多頁，起碼有百多萬字。但假如你一想到中國各朝代的「正史」都是現成的，八這幾千年的各朝代的正史搬在一堆來抄，那就是要編成一部幾百萬言的大書，恐怕也不是如何困難的事吧。然而，這且不說，我們還是較為具體地來談王先生的「中國史」的內容吧。</p>
<p>在「中國史」的「凡例」中，有一條說：「本編制之體裁為通史，最注意於民族之盛衰，國家之興亡，凡有關於盛衰興亡事績，一一詳述其原因結果，以為當代及後世借鏡之資。」由此看來，此書的編者倒好像是富有民族意識似的。但我們翻開這書的第一頁來一看，編者用來代替第一篇序的，便是某國某博士所作的一篇關於中國史的短文；這篇論文在作者站在其自己的立場上述說了過去中國史的經過後，曾作了這樣一個結論：「為中國計，聯絡土地最接近之國，文化最類似之民族，互相扶助，以抵抗歐美諸民族，擁護本國民族，保持本國文化，豈非當代之急務？不此之圖，而　　　交近　　　　　　　」　　　　　　　　　　　　　　真　　，聯蒙古滅金之覆轍，他日一有變動，不但危及漢民族國家之獨立，並影響及於漢文化之存滅。」這種表現便夠說明編者的民族意識究竟清醒到了什麽程度了。</p>
<p>其次，「中國史」的「序論」第一章說：「歷史者研究人類之進化，社會之發達……」這又表現了這書的作者好像還懂得一點進化觀點似的。但在實際上這部大書卻完全是站在反進化的立場上寫出來的。假使真正是有進化觀點的，那就當由社會基礎之變遷，發展來說明各種政治的，文化的變遷和發展：但本書的作者對於春秋戰國時代的諸侯爭戰的事情，諸子百家的學術，以及秦之統一和其所行的政策，對於王莽所行的井田制，對於宋代的學說……等等，都只是依據「正史」敘述它們的現象，並未由進化觀點，從社會基礎之變異去說明這些現象之出現，發展和衰亡，即是並未社會地闡明這些現象的客觀意義。所以，這麼大的一部「中國史」，實際上卻成為了全是事實的堆積的東西，沒有科學的說明，真好像是一大篇幾千年來的流水賬薄。</p>
<p>當然，這部書的主要特點是在依據「正史」記述事實。如果真是死板地記述真有的史實，那也未始不可作為一種參考材料。但中國過去歷史記載有許多並非真的，假使我們毫無一點歷史眼光，只是依據過去記載來編成一部中國史，那就要大鬧笑話了。例如，三皇五帝的傳說，各朝代的許多神話，這些都很少真實性的，我們都當以批判的態度去處理，不應照着舊書瞎抄。可是，「中國史」這書對關於黃帝堯舜等的歷史便是照舊抄下來的；其中有些不合情理的神話也寫在書內了。請看下面這段記載吧：</p>
<p>「九黎之君主蚩尤作亂，率師北上，　取黃河流域。炎帝榆岡出奔　鹿。軒轅氏起兵靖難，　師諸侯，與蚩尤戰於　鹿之野。蚩尤能為霧，軍士昏迷，軒轅作指南車以示四方，遂擒蚩尤誅之。是為漢苗二族戰爭之始。」</p>
<p>我們不相信在上古時代就有一個蚩尤會製烟幕彈，「能為霧」。軒轅黃帝發明指南針自然是有歷史來由的，而且這發明與他和蚩尤作戰也有關係，但這絕不是因為蚩尤會製烟幕彈，「能為霧」；實際情形或是由於在黃帝與蚩尤作戰時，因為氣候變化，空中起了大霧，所以才刺激起黃帝發明指南針，以示方向，這是比　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　也可以把蚩尤「能為霧」的傳說寫出來，但必須要用科學的眼光加以批判，不能死板的照錄下來　誤讀者。事實上，在中國過去的歷史書中不知道有好多奇妙神秘的傳說，如各朝代之興亡，乃至各代黃帝和王公大臣　生死以及天下之治亂等，可說都有神秘的歷史解說，倘若我們都不加批判地照抄下來，那不是太笑話了嗎？然而，「中國史」的作者連把蚩尤「能為霧」的神秘傳說也照抄下來了，這除了表現他的科學知識和歷史知識的淺薄外，是沒有任何意義的。</p>
<p>此外，「中國史」的作者也和過去的「史官」們一樣，抱着「成者為王，敗者為寇」的「褒貶」態度。因此，對於湯放　，武王伐紂，李淵滅隋，與夫王莽亡西漢，曹操曹丕之對付漢獻帝的行為，他的態度是全然不同的：對於前者是歌頌，對於後者則是責駡。這不消說是因為前面那些人的勢力支配時間較長，後面的支配時間較短的緣故。然而，據作者自己說，他的歷史態度還是很客觀的哩！</p>
<p>這部「中國史」雖然已有了這麼大，但是還未編完；現在才編至清代中葉，還有清末和民國的歷史待續。我們且等着瞧吧。不過，為了讀者的利益，我是不敢介紹這部書的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Bitter Cold and Frozen Ground: Juancheng's Yellow River Levee Collapses; Newly Built Dongwang Min Levee Destroyed; Giant Ice Blocks Flow with Ferocious Force <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tens of Thousands of Acres of Fertile Land Submerged in Juancheng, Shouzhang, Fanxian, and Yuncheng Counties</p>
<p>Many People Perish from Freezing in Icy Water, Their Cries Utterly Tragic</p>
<p>Jinan: Earlier this month, warm weather in Jinan caused the Yellow River's upstream ice to thaw, and giant ice blocks flowed downstream. Unexpectedly, the last five days have been extremely cold, reaching -17.3 degrees Celsius. The river ice refroze downstream from the Dongzhuang breach, and the upstream current was blocked, causing ice to accumulate like mountains and raising the water level. The retreated levee of Juancheng County, southeast of the Dongzhuang breach, collapsed at 11 PM on the 17th. The water flowed northeast, and this afternoon, the newly built Dongwang Min levee from early winter was also breached. Giant ice blocks flowed with ferocious force, impossible to control. Tens of thousands of acres of fertile land within the river's loop in Youcheng, Shouzhang, Fanxian, and Yuncheng counties were entirely submerged. The extremely cold weather caused many people to freeze to death in the icy water, their cries utterly tragic. Fortunately, the water will return to the main river via the Huanghuasi Temple in Shouzhang, which may alleviate the southward flow from the Dongzhuang breach and lower the water level in western Shandong and northern Jiangsu. The River Bureau has issued orders to strictly defend the southern bank levee, as it is old and dilapidated. If it breaches again, southern Shandong will be completely devastated. Director Zhang Lianjia is scheduled to inspect the area on the 19th. Due to the ice-caused breach, the water carries ice, which will shatter any boat or person attempting to approach, making rescue impossible. The water has already flowed over twenty li by late afternoon. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Jinan, 18th Night: The River Bureau further reported that the Juancheng retreated levee breach is 25 feet wide and 7 feet deep. Due to the frozen ground, soil cannot be extracted, leading to the breach at Gezhuang. The water is flowing extremely fast, heading east along the levee, with depths varying from 2 to 3 feet. It is expected to pass Xujiaji around 11 PM on the 18th and reach Shuibao by 2 AM on the 19th. River Bureau Director Zhang Lianjia is scheduled to rush to the site for emergency repairs early on the 19th. The distance from Linpu to Huanghuasi Temple is approximately 180 li. If the breached water safely passes through Huanghuasi Temple and rejoins the main river, the Dongzhuang breach blocking project will be easier, and the flood disaster in western Shandong and northern Jiangsu can be avoided, with only a small portion of Juancheng, Yuncheng, Shouzhang, and Fanxian affected.

<p>Beiping/Zhangjiakou News: Five or six days ago, approximately two thousand Mongolian Security Forces moved towards western Suiyuan. Reports indicate that this unit has reached a location 70 li from Pingdiquan in Suiyuan Province and is still advancing. However, their advance avoids the railway line, so their destination is currently unknown. The Shanxi-Suiyuan authorities are paying close attention to this matter. The puppet troops under Li Shouxin in Chahar Province occupied Daqingmen, a vital pass on the Zhangjiakou-Duolun highway, yesterday. After arriving in Zhangbei, the Mongolian Security Forces under Zhuoshigai issued a telegram, with the date signed as the 736th year of Genghis Khan. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: There is no new progress in the Hebei-Chahar negotiations.

<p>Beiping: There are widespread rumors in Beiping that Inner Mongolia has declared independence.

However, it is said that the date filled in the announcement is the 736th year since the birth of Genghis Khan, not the 25th year of the Republic of China. The representative of the Mongolian Autonomous Council stationed in Beiping left for Zhangjiakou last night. Another report states that the main road from Zhangjiakou to Kulun has been blocked outside Zhangjiakou. Zhangbei, 30 li north of Zhangjiakou, will be the capital of this newly independent state. Still another report claims that Prince De issued this telegram under pressure from the Japanese. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Tokyo: After instructing Consul General Suma to return to his post, Foreign Minister Hirota urged the Chinese government to present a genuine proposal for the Sino-Japanese Nanjing Conference. The newly appointed Ambassador to China, Arita Hachiro, will assume his post in mid-February. If the Chinese government's sincerity regarding the Sino-Japanese Conference can be confirmed, he will host the conference and begin the work of rectifying Sino-Japanese relations. Foreign Minister Hirota and Ambassador Arita are currently conferring on diplomatic policy towards China. Its content will undoubtedly follow the established policy. However, attention should be paid to clarifying the following matters regarding the Nanjing Conference and the North China issue: Foreign Minister Hirota presented three principles last autumn. There is no other way for China and Japan to adjust their national relations besides their concrete implementation. The Chinese side widely believes that the North China issue is a dark cloud over Sino-Japanese relations. However, Japan, considering that North China is a connecting zone between China, Japan, and Manchuria, requests the Chinese government's proper handling. (18th Japanese Allied News Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e15">The Restoration of the Pre-War International Situation <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The recent development of international relations has a tendency to gradually revert to the pre-war situation. The amity between France and the Soviet Union, the cooperation between Britain and France, the secret military alliance between Germany and Japan, and the gradual formation of a united Anglo-American front are all obvious signs. Although the composition of this combination differs somewhat from that before the First World War, the fundamental approach is the same: the opposition of the balance of power becomes increasingly intense, and the division of the lines of battle becomes more obvious. As soon as the balance of power is broken in one corner, the entire line can be affected and erupt into a pan-global war. The development of this situation has far-reaching consequences, and we must pay close attention to it.</p>
<p>The development of international relations before the war was driven by a group of emerging imperialists who were dissatisfied with the status quo of the world's division and challenged the imperialists who originally occupied the world's advantage. At that time, the main force representing the emerging imperialists was Germany, and the main force representing the imperialists occupying the world's advantage was Britain and France. There was originally a strong struggle between Britain and France, such as the struggle for Sudan, which almost led to war. However, the crisis of the conflict between Britain and France gradually eased due to the rise of the German power. The German imperialists showed their face to the world and promoted the cooperation between Britain and France with a tough attitude. When Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy formed an alliance against the status quo, Britain and France and Imperial Russia conducted consultations and formed a combination to maintain the status quo. The two sides were clearly divided, and once the balance of power was broken, a full-scale war broke out.</p>
<p>In the decade or so after the war, the imperialists who represented the world's advantage were still Britain and France, and the United States can also be counted as one. Those who represented the new forces and were not satisfied with the status quo were Japan and Italy, which benefited from speculation during the war. Recently, the revival of German imperialism can also be attributed to this aspect. In 1931, the Japanese imperialists attacked Manchuria as the first shot to break the status quo. Last year, the Italian imperialists invaded East Africa as the second shot. Germany has reorganized its military and will demand the return of its old colonies when its strength has grown and the time is right, which will be the third shot. This kind of action to break the status quo and demand the redivision of the world was very scattered in its initial form and reaction. The United Kingdom, France, the United States, and other countries that occupy an advantage in the world cannot immediately abandon their prejudices and unite to deal with the forces against the status quo because they have various serious conflicts with each other. However, this situation will make the forces against the status quo more intense, and the strengthening of the forces against the status quo will eventually promote the union of those who maintain the status quo. Before the war, German Emperor Wilhelm expanded his power in East Africa and Morocco and repeatedly rejected Britain's advice, which eventually led to Britain and France abandoning their prejudices and forming a united front. Recently, Mussolini insisted on the invasion of East Africa, ignoring Britain's mediation, and made Britain and France abandon the suspicion accumulated over many years of vying for hegemony on the continent and established practical cooperation. In the Far East political situation, mutual suspicion between Britain and the United States was originally the same as the opposition between Britain and Russia before the war, and Britain's tolerance for Japan's invasion of the mainland was similar to Britain's secret assistance in the Russo-Japanese War. However, recently, the Japanese imperialists' unlimited aggression and their tough attitude on naval issues have made Britain impatient and intolerable and will eventually form a united front with the United States to resist. At the current stage, although the situation of cooperation between Britain and France and the unity between Britain and the United States has not yet reached sufficient strength, if Italy's attitude in Europe does not ease or further combines with another force against the status quo, Germany, and if Japan's aggression in the Far East continues to advance and even forms an alliance with Germany, the representative of European militarism, the unity of those who maintain the status quo will inevitably be further strengthened. Once these two lines are clearly divided, a great war can be triggered at any moment.</p>
<p>The recent restoration of the international situation to the pre-war state makes us feel that the peril of the Second World War is approaching again. The coming of a major collision will be a great calamity for small and weak nations and a good opportunity for the oppressed to seek liberation. However, the avoidance of this calamity and the application of this opportunity depend on our attention and preparation in advance.</p>
<h3 id="e16">British Foreign Secretary Eden's Speech: Efforts for Peaceful Negotiations; Not Allowing Aggressive Acts to Succeed; Unity of the League of Nations Is Essential for Strength <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>London - British Foreign Secretary Eden is scheduled to attend the League of Nations Council meeting in Geneva, representing the United Kingdom to consider the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. Today, he delivered a public speech in his constituency. This is Eden's first address to the public since assuming the position of Foreign Secretary.</p>
<p>Mr. Eden stated that League of Nations members should be able to make any aggressor realize that peaceful negotiations are not only the best way to eliminate despair but also the only way to succeed. Collective security cannot be easily achieved; it requires tireless work and sacrifice from all parties. Overall, 1935 saw good liaison work, but 1936 must see even closer liaison than before, and even 1937 must see even greater progress. Neither we nor any member state of the League of Nations should ever be complacent or think that we have succeeded, because the goal has not yet been achieved. The efforts we must make are very arduous, but I believe the British people will find it worthwhile to make these efforts. Britain's leadership position is an important factor in this critical situation. We must not be discouraged, but we must be realistic. I will approach this difficult task in this spirit. We must be forward-looking and not limit ourselves to the current war situation faced by the League of Nations. We must uphold two simple principles. In my view, there are two key principles: Aggressive actions must not be allowed to succeed; United action by member states of the League of Nations will form a strong and united body, sufficient to make any aggressor, today or in the future, realize that the best and only way to eliminate resentment and succeed is through peaceful negotiations, not aggression. We should move forward, ensuring that other countries attending Geneva not only agree with us in words but also work together with us in action to pursue a policy of peace, adopting all necessary methods to increase our strength so that we can achieve peace.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Collective Security System: Must Include Two Qualities: Strength and Flexibility <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>A collective security system, if it is to be effective, must have both strength and flexibility. The latter can be adapted to circumstances to eliminate some causes of war, while the former can effectively curb acts of aggression. These are two subsidiary attributes of a security system. The more certain this system is to include these two qualities, the more firmly its authority can be exerted, and the more other countries can fall within its scope. The so-called strength must depend on the extent to which member states of the League of Nations are prepared to fulfill their responsibilities according to their capabilities. If only one or two countries bear this entire burden, there can be no collective system. Furthermore, the effective establishment of a collective security system is the only way to achieve a compromise that can reduce the world's arms burden. It is a great mistake if anyone believes that the British government and people favor some countries over others. British policy does not follow likes or dislikes towards individuals or countries, but as a member of the League of Nations, it is obligated to oppose the destruction of the League's covenant. Any government or people who try to revert to power politics to undermine the collective security system and violate the League's covenant will be attacked by those who stand on the side of the collective system. The British people desire nothing more than peace, and they set their policies on the responsibility of being members of the League of Nations, in the hope that this will achieve peace.</p>
<p>Eden reviewed the events of the past year, stating that the most obvious facts were two: Switzerland's request to reorganize its military and the League of Nations' transformation from a position of being not respected to becoming a practical entity. The British people's only possible solution to European disputes lies in trusting united action, which strengthens their trust in the League of Nations. In 1935, the League of Nations underwent an extremely severe test, and the extent of its success cannot yet be determined. We have made progress, but we have not yet reached the end point. However, we are further ahead than generally predicted six months ago. The League of Nations Council would benefit greatly from examining past events and consolidating accomplished achievements. The valuable advantage of any effective collective security system is that it is the only path to disarmament agreements. The more complete the collective security system, the less insultable its authority will be, and the fewer difficulties there will be in obtaining disarmament agreements. Britain desires peace very much, desires to cooperate with all countries, and is willing to seize every opportunity to consolidate its friendship and understanding with the United States. I believe that disputes between countries can be resolved without resorting to war. If Europe were to experience another large-scale war, civilization would decline as a result. Sir Bryce once said, "If you do not eliminate war, then war will eliminate you." How true this is! Although 1935 had setbacks, it was ultimately a year of progress. Despite encountering various obstacles, the roots of the League of Nations have deepened. 1936 must be a year of continued effort to build on past achievements. With a spirit of compassion and strength, the League of Nations can restore peace and establish understanding between nations. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<p>Geneva - Regarding British Foreign Secretary Eden's speech in his Warwick constituency yesterday, League of Nations officials have expressed satisfaction. The two points that deserve emphasis are: The British Foreign Secretary reiterated that aggressive actions must not be allowed to succeed; Britain's current policy is not limited to the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, and its main objective is to maintain general European security. In addition, it has been stated that Britain's attitude at the upcoming League of Nations Council meeting will still be based on the principles of the League of Nations covenant. Although there is no clear indication of a solution to the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, it can be considered satisfactory. (Havas, 18th)</p>

<p>London - The government's plan to reorganize its military is said to be drafted soon so that the Chancellor of the Exchequer can calculate the necessary expenses in time to include them in the budget. It is reported that the naval part of this plan intends to greatly increase the number of cruisers and build an aircraft carrier. As for the tonnage of battleships and the caliber of guns, etc., they will be determined after the naval conference ends, taking into account the qualitative restriction agreement that may be concluded at the conference. In the air force, it is planned to increase the production of aircraft, and the army will be mechanized on a large scale. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>London - At a cabinet meeting held a few days ago, the issue of merging the Army, Navy, and Air Force into a Ministry of Defense was discussed. It has now been learned that the departments concerned insist on their individual independence and are generally opposed to the proposal. However, the cabinet is still deliberating the merger plan. According to political figures, it is not yet known whether the three departments can be merged. If it is realized, the position of Minister of Defense is planned to be filled by the current Minister without Portfolio, Lord Ponsonby. It has been heard that the First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Monsell, will be relieved of his duties for personal reasons, and Prime Minister Baldwin will appoint former Foreign Secretary Hoare to succeed him as First Lord of the Admiralty, thereby dispelling the negative impression left by Hoare's resignation last month.

<p>London - After the naval conference agreed on the main points of the program for exchanging shipbuilding procedures, it appointed a technical committee today to decide on the details. The committee has already begun work. The naval conference is scheduled to meet on Tuesday to discuss the issue of limiting the types of warships. The technical committee is composed of two members each from Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, and one member each from Canada and India. Today, it considered the Italian proposal for exchanging information, which advocated reporting the number and type of warships to be built at the beginning of each fiscal year, and then reporting the caliber, tonnage, and armor of the guns in detail six months later. Claypool, Counselor of the British Foreign Office, was elected chairman of the committee. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>London - The General Committee of the Naval Conference, with representatives from Britain, France, Italy, and the United States, held a meeting this afternoon, which lasted for two hours. They reached agreement on three points regarding the methods of exchanging information on shipbuilding procedures proposed by Britain, France, and Italy: Each naval power should notify each other several months before starting the construction of a new warship; Before and during the notification period, each naval power does not need to consult each other; Each naval power should announce its shipbuilding program for the year at the beginning of each year. Regarding the first point, France advocated a period of six months, which Britain considered impractical. Regarding the second point, the method of mutual consultation was originally proposed by France, but the General Committee believed that it would cause unnecessary disputes and abandoned it, and decided that if necessary, opinions could be sought through normal diplomatic channels. Regarding the third point, the Technical Subcommittee held a meeting one and a half hours after the General Committee adjourned to discuss the shipbuilding procedures, which should be announced within the first four months of each year. Only the first point has not yet been resolved. The Technical Subcommittee is now scheduled to meet at 10:30 a.m. next Monday to discuss it. If the experts from various countries can reach an agreement at that time, the General Committee will meet on Tuesday to approve it and immediately begin discussing the issue of qualitative restrictions. It is generally believed that the views of the delegations of various countries at the naval conference have been clarified. The naval conference may announce a postponement within three weeks. As for inviting Germany and Russia to participate, according to our correspondent, the naval conference has not yet decided whether to invite them directly or notify them of the content of the agreement after it is concluded.

<p>London - The Japanese observer was not present at the meeting of the Silk Committee of the Naval Conference today. Members of the British delegation hosted a luncheon for members of the Japanese delegation at noon, during which they exchanged views on how to notify Japan if Britain, France, Italy, and the United States were to reach a draft agreement in the future. According to our correspondent, Japan's withdrawal from the naval conference has caused a great "conflict" between Britain and Japan. The main purpose of today's luncheon was to ease this feeling and the repercussions it may cause. It is now heard that members of the Japanese delegation plan to leave Britain next Wednesday.

<p>Berlin - German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels delivered a speech to 20,000 Nazi Party members here tonight, stating that we are willing to remain neutral, but we are well aware that nations such as Italy must survive. It is dangerous if the world does not concede to this demand, because one day a bomb will explode. Goebbels mentioned that the number of unemployed people in Germany has recently increased by 500,000, saying that this is due to the climate and difficulties in lacking raw materials and foreign exchange. We are now in a critical situation, but we hope that there will be a turning point by the end of February. We are a poor country, without colonies and without raw materials, but we must inform other countries that when the time comes, we will demand the return of our colonies. As the world's wealth increases day by day, we are unwilling to remain a poor country for long. Goebbels then mentioned the fundraising along the way, saying that if we do not contribute to help the poor, they will one day rise up and fight for it. Therefore, our poverty alleviation is to prevent internal unrest and ensure the stability of the Nazi state. Finally, he mentioned Germany's reorganization of its military, saying that we cannot do without butter, but we also cannot do without cannons.

<p>Washington - At a meeting of the Senate Arms Trade Investigation Committee today, Senator Glassy harshly criticized the insulting remarks made by Republican Senator Nye against President Wilson, calling Nye a coward and his remarks dishonorable slander.

It should be known that President Wilson himself did not declare war, and the Constitution stipulates that declaring war is the prerogative of Congress. As the Senate debate became fierce, the Department of State released a document containing a report from the US Ambassador to the UK, Page, to President Wilson in May 1915, stating that the UK, France, and Russia agreed to cede a large portion of Austrian territory to Italy, including Slavic peoples, on the condition that Italy join the war within a month.

<p>London - According to official announcements, King George of England has been suffering from bronchitis at Sandringham in recent days, and his heart has gradually shown signs of weakness, which is very worrying. Sir Dawson, the King's physician, traveled from London to Sandringham yesterday and spent the night there. According to his report, the King's bronchitis is not serious. The Prince of Wales and the Duke of York both went to Sandringham last night to visit the King. The King slept well last night. The King is currently resting in Sandringham, and he often rides out with the Duke of Kent. On Sunday, he even walked a quarter of a mile to church to participate in prayers. Those who saw him felt that his spirit was very good. The London medical community said that the use of the phrase "heart gradually showing signs of weakness" by the authorities is enough to prove the physician's concerns. The King celebrated his 70th birthday on June 3 last year. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>London - It was learned from reliable sources at 7:00 a.m. this morning that King George of England slept relatively peacefully last night, and the situation throughout the evening was quite satisfactory.

It has been learned that Ms. Bullock, the King's favorite nurse, is currently attending to him in the sickroom. Home Secretary Sir Simon receives a phone call every hour to report on the King's condition. The discovery of previously unseen signs of heart weakness has shocked the country, as it was generally believed that the King's recovery from a serious illness in 1928 was due to the strength of the King's heart.

<p>London: Rudyard Kipling's remains will be cremated. The time and location will be announced later. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>New York: The Poet Laureate of the British Empire, John Masefield, is currently visiting the United States. Today, he paid high tribute to the famous British poet and writer Rudyard Kipling, saying that Kipling was indeed the best poet of the British Empire, and also a novelist of genius. His poems and prose were extremely popular, humorous, and romantic. In addition, the British novelist Hugh Walpole, currently in Los Angeles, also praised Kipling's works, saying that Kipling's writings were unique, lively, and creative, and would never be forgotten by the world. Canadian Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden, an old friend of Kipling's, said in Ottawa after hearing the sad news of Kipling's death that Kipling was the greatest figure in modern British literature. The British Empire has lost a great patriot, a great artist, and a truly loving person. (Reuters, 18th) The literary fame of the British literary giant Rudyard Kipling was widespread both domestically and internationally, and his experience was indeed a rare one for a writer. He first showed his talent at a young age, and his poems and prose were popular for a time. Before long, the French were also captivated by his writings, calling him "the last poet." He liked to travel extensively from a young age. In his works, he always praised the power of the empire, and the British called him "the poet of the empire," which was well-deserved. He was born in Bombay, India in 1865. His father, John Kipling, was a professor of architecture and sculpture and lived in Bombay. His mother, Alice MacDonald, was the daughter of a Wesleyan pastor. He was known for his humor as a child. Although his academic performance was not outstanding, he was quick-witted and talented. His coursework, although distinctive, showed no signs that he would become a world-renowned literary giant. At the age of seventeen, his father realized his talent and believed that if he could be freed from the shackles of school, he would be able to fully develop it. Kipling left school and entered the journalism industry, working as an editor for the "Civil and Military Gazette" in Lahore, India, to begin his career as a reporter. In 1885, he and his sister published a collection of poems in Lahore called "Echoes," which was unremarkable and did not gain much fame. Soon after, he published two more collections, "Departmental Ditties" and "Barrack-Room Ballads," which were slightly more appreciated. However, his poems still lacked originality. His prose was more readable. His first work, "Plain Tales from the Hills," was published in the Civil and Military Gazette, which he edited. The characteristics of a genius writer were already evident at this time. In 1889, he was ordered by the newspaper to travel the world and write dispatches for the paper, known as "Letters of Marque." Kipling benefited greatly from this trip. On the one hand, his writing skills were greatly improved, and on the other hand, his knowledge was broadened, allowing him to write more freely. His journey took him from China to Japan to the United States, and after three years, he arrived in England. The British were already familiar with his literary reputation, and people vied to meet him wherever he went. The Foreign Secretary Joseph Chamberlain even became his friend. At this time, the Poet Laureate Alfred Austin had just passed away. The British people believed that Kipling's literary fame was comparable to Austin's, and they all believed that Kipling could succeed to this prestigious position. However, he usually rejected honors and refused to accept the position. However, the title of "Poet of the British Nation" had already been bestowed upon him, and he was worthy of it. From then on, Kipling's life consisted of either traveling or living in seclusion in the small town of Rottingdean in Sussex, writing in a small room. At this time, his literary reputation was known far and wide. His books "The Jungle Book," "Kim," and "French Memories" were both literary and artistic masterpieces. Kipling's poems, although inevitably sacrificing meaning for the sake of words, and sacrificing their artistic characteristics for the sake of praising patriotism and imperial glory, were also able to break away from the stereotypes of his peers and were not bound by rules. At that time, British literary works, without the need for interpretation or annotation, were most able to cater to the psychology of the public. Perhaps no one surpassed Kipling in this regard. The British people and people all over the world called his later literary career "the work of a genius," and the reason for this was probably not outside of this. In 1892, Kipling married Caroline Balestier, an American woman. Because Kipling had lived in India for a long time, he looked like an Indian officer, his face was sunburned, dark and ruddy, his eyes were gray-brown and bright, his eyebrows were thick, and his beard was dense. When viewed from the side, his face was short. He was usually taciturn and rarely smiled. After his marriage, he had only one son, whom he loved very much. Unfortunately, he was killed in action on the Western Front in France during the Great War. There were many who praised Kipling's poetic and literary talents, but there were also those who criticized him. Some even denounced him as "a loyal servant of imperialism," and others accused him of harboring a self-aggrandizing mindset and supporting the pro-war faction. However, in all fairness, at the beginning of this century, the power of the British aristocracy was declining, and the morale of the people was low. Kipling believed that it was his duty to call for the restoration of national fortunes, and he was not to be blamed. In 1907, Kipling was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, because at that time, those who admired literature and art could not escape a certain political or humanitarian framework. Kipling's "The Jungle Book" was selected. Although Kipling's call was not only seen in his poems and prose, last May, when King George V of England celebrated the 25th anniversary of his ascension to the throne, Kipling gave a speech at the London Club.

<h3 id="e32">Silver Bloc Members of Congress Discuss Repealing Silver Tax; Treasury Undersecretary and Assistant Resign <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Washington: Members of the House of Representatives from the silver-producing states of the American West today elected five representatives to discuss the possibility of stabilizing silver prices with silver bloc members of the Senate. The House representatives were ordered to discuss the bill passed by the Senate to repeal the provisions in the Silver Purchase Act that require silver merchants to obtain licenses, nationalize silver, and impose a 50% tax on silver profits. At the same time, the Treasury Department is unwilling to comment on the decline in silver prices. When asked about this matter, an official from the Treasury Department stated, "We are still implementing the provisions of the Silver Purchase Act. We cannot comment further." (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington: The silver bloc members of the House of Representatives today decided to discuss with the silver bloc members of the Senate the bill proposed by Senator McCarran to abolish the 50% speculative silver profit tax, and then elected Martin as the leader of the attending members. Martin stated that there are currently no plans to increase the value of silver. However, Senator McCarran solemnly declared that we must immediately find a way to raise silver prices, and that if we treat silver as a commodity for one day, the rise and fall of silver prices will be uncertain for one day. I support swift action to make silver currency, stabilize the price of silver at $1.29 per ounce, and issue sufficient currency with silver ingots as reserves, making it a basic currency. I am very satisfied with the decision of the silver bloc members of the House of Representatives to discuss with the silver bloc members of the Senate the proposal I proposed to restore the free silver market in the United States. Representative Faddis stated that the silver bloc is currently in a commanding position. The impact of the large amount of silver stockpiled in the United States on the silver market is no different from the large amount of American wheat stored by the Federal Farm Board a few years ago. If such a situation had occurred in 1927, it might have led to a serious panic. But today, the world's currency situation is very different from the past. Faddis also reiterated his belief, clarifying the effectiveness of silver storage, stating that the basis of currency prices around the world is not gold and silver, but the value of the British paper pound. If this situation does not change, there will be no progress in the world's currency. I know that the future price of silver will have an important impact on the world's currency.

<p>Washington: Treasury Secretary Coolidge and Assistant Secretary Robert have both requested to resign. President Roosevelt has accepted their resignations today, and they will hand over their duties on February 15th. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington: Treasury officials today announced the amount of silver purchased when silver prices fell in December of last year, revealing that the Treasury is still far from the goal stipulated in the 1934 Silver Purchase Act. The Treasury stated that a total of 73,332,000 ounces of silver were purchased in the three weeks before December 27th last year. This purchase has raised the current silver reserves to a level of 1,526,594,000 ounces. The average price paid by the Treasury for this silver when the Roosevelt administration purchased it was 57 cents per ounce, while the current world silver price is lower than 50 cents. Based on the current $10,158,000,000 in gold reserves, the Treasury still needs to purchase 1,098,405,000 ounces of silver to comply with the provisions of the Silver Purchase Act, as the total amount of silver purchased should be one-fourth of the gold reserves. At the same time, the Department of Commerce reported today that a total of $10,507,829 worth of silver was imported in the week ending January 3rd, and $23,506,206 in the week ending January 10th, of which $14,768,819 came from the United Kingdom, $6,311,816 came from China, and $1,055,735 came from Japan.

<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The Construction Committee, in order to develop transportation in central Anhui and facilitate the transportation of coal from the Huainan coal mines under its jurisdiction, has actively constructed the Huainan Railway, which has now been fully completed. Freight and passenger cars have also been fully equipped. The railway is 220 kilometers long, starting from Tianjia'an in the Huainan mining area, passing through Chaoxian, Hefei, and Jiulonggang, and ending at Yuxikou, opposite Wuhu, on the Yangtze River. It traverses central Anhui and provides convenient and efficient passenger and freight transportation. Therefore, the company has specifically agreed with the Jiangnan Company to operate joint transportation services on the Jingwu and Wuxuan sections. Dock terminals will be established at the Yuxikou terminus and the Wuhu station of the Jiangnan Railway by the Wuhu Riverbank, and a ferry service will be arranged to connect and facilitate transportation across the river. Wuhu has decided to use the old wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and has dispatched Li Zirong to Wuhu to conduct water level measurements and arrange pontoon boats. It is currently scheduled to open the entire line for trial traffic on the 20th of this month, selling tickets and operating passenger and freight transportation. Cheng Shifan, the director of the railway bureau, Hu Weizhong, the deputy director, Zhang Zijing, the director of the Xiaguan office, the director of the Yuxikou coal plant, and others are scheduled to arrive in Wuhu on the evening of the 18th to inspect the line by car. The official opening ceremony will be held at a later date, and people from Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhu, and other places will be invited to visit the line and the Huainan mining area. (January 17th)</p>

<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Shang Zhen, the newly appointed Chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, has been in office for over half a month since assuming his post on New Year's Day. However, the first Director of Education, Chen Fangxian, has not yet arrived from Beijing, and the Director of Finance, Yin Renxian, has not reported to his office, expressing his firm intention to resign. In effect, two of the four departments are at a standstill. Subsequently, after Shang Zhen repeatedly persuaded Yin, he reported to the office on the 10th and resumed his duties. Chen also reported to the office on the 15th to take charge. The entire organization of the provincial government has now been completed. According to Shang's discussion of future administrative policies, he stated: Henan Province has enjoyed peace for several years, and various scales are already in place. The most important thing is to implement the original plans in a practical manner. The government exists for the sake of the local people and should promote their interests and eliminate their problems. In the future, the government must adopt local opinions and properly plan for the welfare of the people. The current issues that should be addressed in Henan Province are:</p>
<p>Eradicating the remnants of bandits: Only by eliminating violence can we ensure the safety of the good people. Recently, scattered bandits in northern and western Henan have gradually gathered and harmed the local residents. A fundamental elimination must be carried out to maintain public security.</p>
<p>Eliminating drugs: Drugs in Henan Province are causally related to bandits. The elimination of bandits also requires the elimination of drugs.</p>
<p>Preventing traitors: Traitors harm the country, harbor bandits, transport drugs, and commit all kinds of evils. Therefore, it is necessary to effectively prevent them.</p>
<p>Other measures, such as reducing the burden on the people, are being planned. He also ordered the various departments to draft administrative steps in order to formulate procedures and seek administrative efficiency without being rash or lax. (January 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Chaoshan: Large Quantities of Smuggled Goods Intercepted — A Certain Police Station Even Arrests People in Shantou — <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Recently, the anti-smuggling work in Chaoshan has been extremely strict, but smugglers, with their special connections, have not reduced their activities. On the 9th, the customs patrol ship "Lianxing" patrolled the waters around Nanao and other places, and spotted a sharp-nosed speedboat heading towards Waisha in Chenghai, apparently about to unload smuggled goods. The Lianxing pursued and caught the vessel, which was identified as the "Ruixiang Maru," arriving from Taiwan. It carried 450 bags of white sugar, 450 barrels of alcohol, and seven Taiwanese ruffians. The patrol ship towed the smuggled goods and smugglers back to the Customs House for detention and investigation. When towed into Shantou Port, the authorities, fearing a raid by the ruffians, dispatched armed customs soldiers to guard the area near the Customs House. Furthermore, the Chaoshan Anti-Smuggling Office has recently been paying close attention to smuggled goods in various market towns in the Chaoshan-Meizhou inland areas. The office dispatched inspector Ye Tianyi on the 9th, leading forty to fifty special agents and tax police in three motorboats to search various rice and bean shops in Chaoyang City. However, due to a leak, the unscrupulous merchants had already moved the smuggled goods when the inspector arrived. Moreover, on the 4th, anti-smuggling officers in Jieyang District led tax police to search the markets in Fengkou, Quxi, and Paotai, seizing twenty cans of soybean oil at the Pujie Railway Station on the 7th, sixteen bags of smuggled beans in Denggang on the 8th, and over seventy bags of smuggled beans in Yugao on the 9th. On the 9th, a boat carrying smuggled goods was intercepted on the river near Paotai, containing large quantities of foreign sugar, sea cucumber, fish maw, and other goods. When the tax police detained the boat, the smuggler Lin Jing even injured a tax policeman. Statistics show that since the unified crackdown began on December 1st in the Chaoshan-Meizhou area, a large number of untaxed goods have been seized, dealing a major blow to ruffians and smugglers. Recently, they have suddenly turned their anger on the Chinese. At 11 a.m. on the 9th, a police chief from a certain consulate, accompanied by more than ten ruffians carrying short guns, arrived at No. 37, Taiping Road, third floor, and arrested Chen Zhong. Chen is from Huizhou, 29 years old. His father and brothers have been doing business in a certain place for a long time, but Chen himself has not obtained citizenship in that country. He recently worked for a certain commercial firm and has not engaged in any illegal activities. The ruffians accused Chen of leaking certain secrets and were determined to obtain them. However, Chen resisted fiercely when arrested and fled into the First District Public Security Bureau. The ruffians rushed into the branch bureau to arrest him. Chief of the branch bureau, Lu Qing, immediately reported to the Public Security Bureau and requested instructions on how to handle the situation. At that time, the police chief of a certain consulate led the ruffians in a threatening manner, claiming that Chen Zhong was impersonating a citizen of that country, investigating information, and leaking secrets, and insisted on arresting him. Chief Lu sternly refused, stating that Chen was a Chinese citizen and should be dealt with according to proper procedures if he had committed any illegal acts. Such unauthorized arrests would undermine diplomatic relations and trample on Chinese sovereignty. The ruffians had no choice but to leave in disappointment. Chen Zhong narrowly escaped. The Shantou Municipal Government submitted a letter of protest to the consul of that country on the 10th and telegraphed the details to the provincial government.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Xiang River Embankment Restoration Project Begins; 60,000 Workers Repair Yaodi in San Si Gong; Closure Work to Begin This Month, Joining Next Month <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The restoration project of the Jianghan Embankment will either combine the Xiang River line into a lake or divert it into a river. The Yaodi, a flood defense levee, in the fertile area will undertake the work of closing the breaches and diverting the flow, with a budget of over 2 million yuan, originally estimated to employ 80,000 workers daily and be completed within five months. However, due to the difficulty in recruiting workers, the number has been reduced to 60,000 workers daily, recruited by the Sixth District Administrative Inspectorate Commissioner's Office, which established the Xiang River Embankment Project Office to oversee the work. Work has officially begun. Xi Dejiong, Director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau and concurrently Director of the Xiang River Embankment Project Office, reported the progress and difficulties to Governor Yang Yongtai on the 17th. Regarding the equipment and layout, he elaborated on several points:</p>
<p>Worker Housing: For the Yaodi project, it is estimated that 60,000 workers are needed, requiring two reed mats per person, totaling 120,000 mats, which were purchased last December. Over 90,000 mats have been distributed and erected, accommodating 40,000 to 50,000 people. The remaining mats can be erected quickly to accommodate all 60,000 workers.</p>
<p>Water Pumps: Two 4-horsepower, 4-inch diameter water pumps, twenty hand-operated water pumps, and ten old-style waterwheels have been installed. A portion was transported here on December 30th of last year, and more engine-driven water pumps are being ordered to alleviate the emergency. As workers arrive, both drainage and earth filling will be carried out to prevent water from seeping back from other areas.</p>
<p>Erosion of Embankment Base and Ramming Seabed: Removing the turf from the embankment base and ramming the seabed have been contracted out in sections since December 5th of last year and have been completed.</p>
<p>Worker Food Supply: 10,000 shi of rice have been purchased in areas with abundant rice production and low prices and stored at the project site in anticipation of local rice price increases or shortages, allowing workers to purchase food freely.</p>
<p>Project Site Telephone: A long-distance telephone line has been negotiated with the Director of the Construction Department to be erected along the route and connected to the Shayang provincial line. Approval has also been granted by the Economic Commission to request the Ministry of Communications to dispatch personnel to establish a wireless radio station and install it in Hubei as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Sanitation: One or two medical teams have been established and arrived at Jiukou on January 5th.</p>
<p>The plan for closing the breach and the urgency of labor for the Yaodi were outlined, stating that the breach at San Si Gong is five to six kilometers long. Water rushes in through the breach, either forming a lake or dividing into several streams, with varying depths and complex conditions. In addition to the Yaodi project, the Project Office should also carry out the work of closing the breach and diverting the flow. If the flow diversion work is not done carefully, it may waste significant funds and be counterproductive. The Bureau first dispatched a survey team to conduct a detailed survey of the terrain and another team to work with the Project Office to select the Xiongjiaqiao</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>to Xinjiekou section, where the river channel is narrowest and shallowest, making flow diversion the most economical, based on the survey and on-site investigations. Dejiong personally inspected and verified that this location was indeed suitable and decided to divert the flow there. A light railway will immediately be laid from the Bato of the Si Gong dam to prevent the water level from rising and overflowing from both ends during the flow diversion. One end of the water barrier dam has already been built, and most of the materials have been transported. The flow diversion work is scheduled to begin on the 20th of this month. The flow diversion method has been studied in detail by the Bureau, taking into account the sediment content, velocity, terrain, and other conditions of the water flow at that location, and it has been decided that the closure can be completed before February 10th. The amount of earthwork for the Yaodi is very large, and whether it can be completed before the flood season depends on the number of workers. Although the county governments have been requested to recommend contractors to the project office, the contractors initially delayed signing contracts, intending to demand an increase in the unit price. After repeated persuasion by the project office, and changing the wage distribution from actual wages to 90% of actual wages, they gradually signed contracts. The agreed unit price, the specified deadline, and the number of workers to be provided are all stated in the contract. However, after signing, the contractors still did not bring all the workers to the site, in order to coerce and threaten. Subsequently, after discussions between the Department of Public Works and representatives from the Sixth District Administrative Inspectorate Commissioner's Office, a subsidy of 1.2 jiao per square yard was added to the unit price of 5 jiao for rain work, bringing the total unit price to a minimum of 6.2 jiao and a maximum of 9.2 jiao. The average price, including ramming work, reached the maximum amount of 8.5 jiao of the approved budget. The representative of the Commissioner's Office signed the agreement, requiring the workers to arrive in full force by the 20th of this month. Although there has been a slight increase in enthusiasm, the number of workers who have arrived is still less than 10,000. Under these circumstances, the Bureau is deeply concerned that it will still be difficult to avoid them attempting to coerce and threaten by slowing down work or withdrawing workers in the future. It is requested that the importance and urgency of the project be considered, and that the Sixth District Administrative Inspectorate Commissioner's Office be instructed to strictly urge the county governments to urge the contractors to supervise the workers and order them to arrive in full force. If there are any more cases of slowing down work or desertion, administrative force should be used to supervise them. If the contractors are fearful, they will not dare to arbitrarily coerce and threaten again, so that the work can be completed as soon as possible. Director of the Bureau, Xi Dejiong, is scheduled to personally supervise the work at the project site in the coming days. However, if it becomes necessary to leave the project site, Chief Engineer Lin Youlong will act on his behalf. (January 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Journey to Nanchang (Part 1) - The Opening Ceremony of the Yushan-Nanchang Section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and Other Matters - <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, our country's government authorities have spared no effort in the construction of aviation and highways. East-west transportation south of the Yangtze River has always relied on ports, rivers, and lakes as shortcuts. Now, a significant transformation has begun. The substantial completion of highway networks among the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan serves as a concrete illustration. As a result, inland transportation has become greatly facilitated. However, in terms of safety, comfort, accuracy, speed, freedom, and low costs, highway transportation still lags far behind railway transportation. The urgent desire for railway expansion is therefore more pressing. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, a crucial inland transportation artery between the Yangtze River and Pearl River basins, has managed to complete a portion of its construction with economical financial resources, a short timeframe, and under the management of domestic technical personnel.</p>
<p>Construction Planning of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway</p>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was originally planned to start from Hangzhou in Zhejiang and end at Pingxiang in Jiangxi, with a total length of 904 kilometers. Among them, the section from Hangzhou via Xiaoshan, Zhuji, Yiwu, Jinhua, Tangxi, Longyou, Quzhou, and Jiangshan to Yushan in Jiangxi, totaling 341 kilometers, was originally named the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway. Construction began in March of the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930) and was completed and opened to traffic in December of the 22nd year (1933). The 292-kilometer section from Yushan via Shangrao, Hengfeng, Yiyang, Guixi, Dongxiang, and Jinxian to Nanchang – called the Yushan-Nanchang Section – began preparations immediately after the opening of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway. In April of the 23rd year (1934), construction was approved by the Ministry of Railways and the Zhejiang and Jiangxi provincial governments. As for the 263-kilometer section between Nanchang and Pingxiang – the Nanchang-Pingxiang Section – construction also commenced on the day of the opening ceremony of the Yushan-Nanchang Section on the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>The construction capital for this section was funded by the issuance of public bonds of 12 million yuan each by the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Finance, totaling 24 million yuan. Using the bond face value and all assets after the completion of the Yushan-Nanchang Section as collateral, loans and advances were borrowed from the Shanghai banking group and the German company Otto Wolff for purchasing materials, amounting to 16 million yuan. A joint venture called the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway United Company was established to oversee all aspects of the entire railway. Starting from July 20th of the 23rd year (1934), the entire section was divided into four general sections and sixteen sub-sections, and construction commenced simultaneously. It took 17 months to complete the construction by December of the 24th year (1935). If there had been no disruptions caused by floods and bandits during this period, it could have been opened to traffic as early as last year's National Day.</p>
<p>Inviting Guests from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>After the reporter received the invitation from the Board of Directors of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway United Company for the opening ceremony of the Yushan-Nanchang Section to be held in Nanchang on the 15th of this month, he and a group of eighteen reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers in Shanghai took the Beijing-Zhabei express train to Hangzhou at 3 PM on the 13th. According to the invitation, they were to arrive at the Sanlangmiao waiting area at the Nanxing Bridge Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway before 8 PM that evening.</p>
<p>As the train passed Jiaxing, light snow began to fall. Although Yuanhu Lake was at its lowest water level, it and the Misty Rain Pavilion in the lake seemed to be covered with a layer of white gauze, presenting a unique and exquisite charm. The train arrived at Nanwu Bridge, and darkness fell, the clouds already deep.</p>
<p>The reception for the opening ceremony had already dispatched several staff members to the station to greet the guests. (Originally, their invitation was not limited to Shanghai newspaper reporters, but also included those from Nanjing and Hangzhou, and most importantly, the Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Huang Shaohong, and the Vice Minister of Railways, Zeng Yangfu – who also served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway United Company, so he could be considered the host – Legislative Member Ma Yinchu, and other important political figures, members of the financial and industrial sectors, and local officials along the railway.) In total, there were over three hundred people. They had prepared more than ten small chartered cars and buses to transport the guests to the Sanlangmiao pier, which was the main ferry crossing before the completion of the Qiantang River Bridge. Every day, from 6 AM to 6 PM, there was a constant stream of passengers traveling between the two banks of the Qiantang River, being transported by the Qiantang River Ferry. A new-style steel-reinforced concrete pier had been built at the riverbank, extending from the shallow beach to the floating dock in the center of the river, about half a li in length. This was wide enough for two cars to pass each other.</p>
<p>Crossing the Qiantang River on a Snowy Night</p>
<p>When the reporter arrived there, it was about 8 o'clock. Although there was no particularly biting cold wind on the river, the snow was falling even more heavily. At the floating dock, the enthusiastic reception staff was waiting, issuing numbered sleeper tickets for the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway according to the invitation numbers. By the time we got off the ferry, our hands and feet were already numb with cold. The ferry was a large wooden boat with high-raised ends, with a cabin that could accommodate twenty people. Perhaps it was special that evening, but there was a bright kerosene lamp hanging inside. On the dimly lit river, every two ferries were towed across the river by a small steamboat.</p>
<p>The Xixing riverside pier also had such a new-style pier and floating dock. However, the pier was open-air. There were already many cars waiting to welcome the guests and take them to the station. In fact, if viewed in daylight, the distance between the pier and the station might be only a stone's throw away.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Special Train's Arrangement</p>
<p>The Hangzhou-Jiangshan section uses 35-pound light rails, so the locomotives and passenger cars are also limited. The car bodies are shorter and lower compared to those on the Beijing-Shanghai line, and perhaps even narrower (although the distance between the two rails is the same as on the Beijing-Shanghai line). However, the equipment inside the cars is relatively complete. The special train parked at the riverside station consisted of fifteen cars, including first, second, and third-class seating and sleeping cars. The dignitaries were traveling in an "office car" with complete bedding. The Party and national flags were crossed at the front of the car, covered with paper flowers. Inside the carriages, there were also many colorful paper flowers and ribbons hanging beautifully.</p>
<p>The catering for all three hundred guests on the train was contracted to Tianxianglou, the largest restaurant in Hangzhou. The owner was also dressed as a waiter, taking care of the arrangements in the car. Each guest paid 6 jiao per meal. Each table of four had four dishes and a hot pot. The reception stipulated that he must use local products from along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway as raw materials. At 9 PM on the 13th, everyone enjoyed the dinner very much. At 10 PM, the train departed, and the guests gradually entered the sleeping cars to sleep.</p>
<p>Each sleeping car had two attendants managing the berths, doors, windows, and toilets. Seeing how politely they accepted the passengers' requests, it was clear that they had received considerable training. All thirty of them served on this special train, with eighteen assigned to each. Most of them spoke with a Zhejiang accent, and their ages ranged from sixteen to twenty-five. They wore yellow woolen uniforms, and their hats also had "flying wheel" emblems. They were in good spirits and physical condition. Their monthly salary ranged from ten to fifteen yuan, and they were not allowed to accept tips from passengers. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Company also did not abandon its obligation to continue educating them. They have now established employee children's schools in Jiangbian, Jinhua, Yushan, and other places, giving them the opportunity to receive education.</p>
<p>The Train Passes Jiangshan at Dawn</p>
<p>The train traveled steadily, and the sound of the wheels accompanied many large and small stations and beautiful scenery throughout the night. On the morning of January 14th, the weather was gloomy. The train stopped at Jiangshan Station. Peering out the window from the sleeper berth, the distant mountains were still so green, but nearby, one could only see rolling red and yellow earthen hills. Small houses were scattered in the mountainous area. Three or five village children were still staring blankly at the train, which they had already seen many times. Material civilization has not yet fully penetrated this ancient land – even in the culturally rich region of Zhejiang and Jiangsu.</p>
<p>After passing Jiangshan, the scenery completely lost the elegant charm of the area near Hangzhou. From here until Yushan, west of the Jiangxi provincial border, was the area where the Red Bandits roamed a year ago. On each hilltop and strategic pass, one could see the blockhouses that prevented the Red Bandits from gaining a foothold in Jiangxi. Now that this area has been cleared, these blockhouses have become merely decorations in these desolate mountains.</p>
<p>Scenery Along the Yushan-Nanchang Line</p>
<p>At 9:30 AM, we arrived at Yushan, which was the original terminus of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway. Further ahead was Yushan, the starting point of the Yushan-Nanchang section. Yushan Station occupies a large area and has many branch lines. In the future, it will definitely become the largest distribution station for goods in the upper reaches of the Xin River. When the train entered the station, the station staff set off many firecrackers. They also built a decorated archway on the railway west of the station, allowing the first train to pass underneath and onto the newly completed Yushan-Nanchang section.</p>
<p>Around 11 AM, we arrived at Shangrao. This place had been occupied by the Red Bandits three times, and the local area suffered great losses. The population had drastically decreased from 300,000 to 240,000. The main products are tea, paper, and ramie cloth. In the past, annual sales of each item reached 500,000 yuan, but now things are not what they used to be. Shangrao and its surrounding counties of Yushan, Guangfeng, Qianshan, Yiyang, and Hengfeng each have 300 blockhouses within their borders, totaling nearly 2,000 in the six counties. In this area, one often doesn't see any signs of human habitation for dozens of li. Even if there are, one only sees a few dilapidated mud houses, some without windows, and the walls still bearing the large-character slogans written by the Red Bandits back then. Last year, the Yushan-Nanchang section project encountered great obstacles here. First, it encountered unprecedented heavy rainfall, which affected the work. Second, there were still many Red Bandits scattered in this area, who often invaded the lodgings of the road workers, killing refugees who had escaped from the Red areas and were considered by them to be reactionaries, and coercing recruited road workers to go to the Red areas. In addition, "after the war, there is always a famine," and there was also a severe epidemic of malaria. As a result, no less than 2,000 road workers sacrificed their lives in this section.</p>
<p>Twenty-three kilometers west of Shangrao, along the railway, there is a coal mine called Kengkour. Although the coal seams in the mine are mostly poor, the upper layer of the Dachong Mine contains excellent coal that can be used for locomotive fuel and ordinary furnaces and blacksmithing. It is worth mining. The length of the coal seams, according to current estimates, is 2,700 meters, the thickness of the coal seams is 3 meters, and the minable depth is 719 meters. The amount of coal that can be mined is 5,299,749 tons. If 300 tons are produced per day, it can last for 50 years. The railway has plans to mine it to supply its own needs.</p>
<p>After passing Hengfeng and Yiyang, we arrived at Guixi. Twenty-five kilometers south of the station is Longhu Mountain, the so-called birthplace of Taoism. The former residence of the Taoist patriarch Zhang Daoling is located there. Near Guixi, there is also a large bridge, second only to the large bridge near Liangjiadu in the railway's bridge engineering projects. It has thirteen arches and is 390 meters long, costing nearly 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Arriving in Nanchang Late at Night</p>
<p>After this, darkness fell again. But at each station, people set off firecrackers to welcome us, and there were always soldiers and police on guard near the station. It wasn't until 10 PM that the lights of Nanchang could be seen outside the train window. The reception had already contacted Nanchang by long-distance telephone from the previous two stations, arranging for all the guests to stay at major hotels.</p>
<p>The long train journey of nearly thirty hours finally came to an end at 10:30 PM. Amidst the symphony of military music and firecrackers, the train entered Nanchang Station. Over two hundred people, including the Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, Xiong Shihui, important figures from various political parties, Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway personnel, and local newspaper reporters, gathered on the platform to welcome us. Huang Shaohong and Zeng Yangfu were the first to get off the train, receiving salutes from the local army, which presented a grand military appearance.</p>
<p>After exiting the station, we boarded highway buses and were taken to designated hotels. Everyone was exhausted and fell asleep as soon as they lay down. On the afternoon of January 14th, the reporter interviewed the Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Huang Shaohong, and the Vice Minister of Railways, Zeng Yangfu, in the train. According to Huang, regarding local administration in Zhejiang, he intends to increase the power of the county governments, and is currently in the testing phase. The reason why we can't start in all counties simultaneously is just like a parent with children: those who can be independent are allowed to be independent, but those who cannot be independent still need parental supervision. Continuing to talk about the current situation, Huang said that the issues of the 29th Army and North China can be used as an example. Just as the demise of the Southern Song Dynasty was blamed by later generations on Qin Hui's advocacy of peace, Yue Fei's advocacy of war would not necessarily have defeated the Jin army. Moreover, the Southern Song Dynasty was destroyed a hundred years after Qin Hui's death. The responsibility lies not with Qin Hui and Emperor Gaozong, but with the foolish monarchs after Gaozong. The North China issue can also be viewed in a similar way. The Southwest has no intention of destroying the country. If national affairs can be considered from a broad and long-term perspective, no problem is unsolvable. Political problems can be easily solved if the environment is favorable. Regarding the Mongolian issue, he said that Prince Yun is old and weak, and his mind is muddled, so he is not capable of doing anything. However, Prince De has great ambitions, so the Mongolian issue is very complex.</p>
<p>According to Zeng Yangfu, "The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway starts from Hangzhou and extends to Yushan, then to Nanchang, and connects to the Zhuzhou-Pingxiang Railway at Pingxiang, linking to the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. To the east, it can reach Shanghai, and to the south, it can go directly to Guangzhou. Therefore, the commencement of the Nanchang-Pingxiang section and the opening of the Yushan-Nanchang section will be held on the same day. The construction cost of the Nanchang-Pingxiang section is 18 million yuan, similar to the Yushan-Nanchang section. We borrowed 10 million yuan from the Shanghai banking group and 8 million yuan from the German Otto Wolff Company. A preliminary agreement was signed in April last year, so there should be no problem with securing the loan. The Yushan-Nanchang section, which has now been completed, uses 65-pound heavy rails throughout, except for the Hangzhou-Yushan section, which uses 35-pound light rails. We hope to achieve a permanent solution. However, due to the weight of the rails, the vehicles on the Hangzhou-Yushan section can travel to Nanchang, but the vehicles on the Yushan-Nanchang section cannot enter the Hangzhou-Yushan section. It is planned to replace the light rails on the Hangzhou-Yushan section with heavy rails within this year. By next year, after the completion of the Qiantang River Railway Bridge, the Nanchang-Pingxiang section, and the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, all railways in the country can be directly connected. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway also plans to use diesel locomotives to shorten travel time, so that it can depart from Hangzhou at 7 AM and arrive in Nanchang at 5 PM on the same day. Currently, the roadbed is not yet solid, and everything is still in the initial stages. At the same time, there is no current need for this. For the safety of the journey, the train is running relatively slowly."</p>

<p>In December of last year, Wuxi's silk factories were forced to shut down due to sluggish sales in Europe, with prices falling from over 800 yuan per dan to around 700 yuan, coupled with a severe shortage of raw materials. However, recently, the silk market has seen a unanimous rise in prices both domestically and internationally. This is due to the disruption of silk sources and the limited production of Japanese silk. American silk factories, aware that new silk will not be available for several months and that the spring sales season is approaching, are eager to purchase large quantities. As a result, they are actively buying, and in the past two weeks, the price of Chinese silk has gradually soared. High-grade white factory silk has risen to around 850 yuan per package, and user silk is also at 720-730 yuan. Only a few factories in Wuxi, such as Huaxin, Yongtai, and Qianxin, as well as ten factories including Yongsheng, Dasheng, Minfeng, Jinji, and Yuqi, are still operating as usual. They plan to stop work for a week at the end of the old lunar year. As for the other factories, Yongli Company, newly established by Xue Shoucha, Wang Huanan, Zheng Bingquan, and others, has leased 37 of them and plans to start production in full after the new cocoons come onto the market.</p>

<p>Tan Guangyu, the Jia head of the sixth Jia of the third Bao of the Nanyin Township in the third district of Wujin, was tasked with patrolling the watch post. On the evening of the 13th of this month, he led the post guards Tan Falong and Tan Faming on patrol in the vicinity. To their surprise, Tan Guangyu did not return home by dawn. His wife, Zhou, searched everywhere but could not find him. Tan Falong and Tan Faming were also missing. Realizing that something must be amiss, she ordered the post guards to investigate. Bloodstains were found all over Tan Falong's house, indicating that Falong had been murdered. It was learned that Falong had fled to the Qingcheng area. Tan Zhou immediately asked the township Bao head to report to the Third Sub-station of the Public Security Bureau and request police assistance. They arrested Tan Falong, Tan Faming, and Tan Jiangshi in Qingcheng. After a preliminary interrogation, they all confessed to murdering Tan Guangyu. They confessed that they first struck Guangyu's head with a gong hammer, then strangled his neck with a coarse hemp rope, and then took a kitchen knife and slashed his head twice, killing him instantly. In order to cover up the crime, they carried the body to the river and dumped it into the river. Inspector Deng Zuyu immediately sent people to try to retrieve the body. It was found on the riverbank. On the 16th, he prepared a document to report to the Procuratorate of the Local Court and requested that personnel be dispatched for an examination. It was heard that Prosecutor Guan Junjie had been appointed and led his staff to the countryside on the morning of the 17th to examine the body.

<p>Since the beginning of winter, this area has experienced rain and snow, but the climate has remained mild as in autumn. However, after the 16th of this month, the northwest wind roared, and the weather changed dramatically, turning extremely cold.

As a result, water freezes into ice, and bathhouses and bathhouses are thriving. However, rivers, harbors, ponds, and pools are all frozen, and small steamships and sailing ships traveling to and from the city and countryside have been interrupted. Although water transport to other ports has been cut off, it has had no impact since the introduction of automobiles last autumn.</p>

<p>The seventh car of the Xihu Automobile Company, traveling to Wuxi yesterday, was passing the Twenty-Nine Bridge area near Liantang when an elderly man suddenly came into view. He was deaf and blind and could not avoid the car to the left or right.

<p>At about 2 AM on the 16th, a sailing ship traveling from Yangku to the city arrived near Jintong Bridge, when it was suddenly encountered by more than ten bandits. They shouted for the ship to stop along the river, and each of them, carrying guns and weapons, boarded the ship and searched it arbitrarily.

After the shipowner, Xie Chunlin, arrived in the city, he reported the incident to the Public Security Bureau and requested that the county investigate. County Magistrate Yan, upon receiving the report, ordered the security team to strengthen patrols, as theft cases have occurred frequently in the four townships during this winter prevention period.</p>

<p>Reuter's, Shanghai, January 18 - Reuter's learns from reliable sources that the rumors that North China Customs, salt taxes, and railway revenues have been withheld by the North China authorities are incorrect. The various taxes are currently being submitted to the Central Government as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Salt Tax Revenue Increases in 1935 <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>According to the preliminary statistics of the Salt Revenue Audit Office for 1935, the total salt tax revenue was 184,209,300 national currency, an increase of 8,259,300 yuan compared to the 175,950,000 yuan collected in 1934. Last year, financial conditions were tight, commerce was depressed, and there was a severe flood in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, which greatly affected salt transportation. Despite this, the tax revenue was still able to achieve this result, which is truly remarkable. The tax revenue of each region is listed below in order of magnitude. However, these figures are based on preliminary reports from various locations, and may be subject to revision after a detailed audit of the accounts. Changlu (including the Koubei area) - 26,775,200 national currency, Huaibei - 19,555,300 yuan, Sichuan (including the Chongqing area) - 15,620,900 yuan, E'an - 14,652,200 yuan, Xiang'an - 13,387,400 yuan, Yangzhou - 13,356,100 yuan, Songjiang - 12,568,000 yuan, Youdong - 9,672,800 yuan, Guangdong - 9,290,500 yuan, Xi'an - 9,085,300 yuan, Liangzhe - 9,006,700 yuan, Henan - 7,703,200 yuan, Wan'an - 6,083,600 yuan, Fujian - 4,715,600 yuan, Hedong - 4,067,100 yuan, Yunnan - 2,095,800 yuan, Chuanbei - 2,092,700 yuan, Shaanxi - 1,479,700 yuan, General Office - 1,206,300 yuan, Jinbei - 1,004,900 yuan, Total - 184,209,300 national currency.</p>

<p>It is still difficult to predict whether we will recover in the future. The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee of the Central Bank, due to the low price of silver abroad and the disappearance of silver exports, has stabilized the exchange rate and temporarily suspended the balance tax yesterday. Whether or not it will be restored in the future depends on the situation. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Temporary Suspension of Balance Tax: Members of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee of the Central Bank: Xi Demao of the Central Bank, Bei Songsun of the Bank of China, and Zhang Peishen of the Bank of Communications, met again at the Business Bureau of the Central Bank at 10:00 AM yesterday morning to discuss the balance tax rate. It was agreed that there was no need for a balance tax at the moment due to the low price of silver abroad and the balanced exchange rates of various countries. It was decided to temporarily suspend the announcement for one day yesterday. The balance tax was immediately announced to be 0.00%, a new record since its implementation. According to a New News Agency reporter who inquired with the committee, although the balance tax was not announced yesterday, this is a temporary measure. Whether it will continue to be suspended in the future or announced as usual is still unpredictable and depends on the decision of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee.</p>
<p>Stable Foreign Exchange: The Central Bank announced the selling price of telegraphic transfers yesterday morning, converted as follows: London - 1 shilling, 2 and a half pence per national currency yuan; New York - 29.75 US dollars; Paris - 452 francs; Berlin - 73.75 marks; Japan - 103 yen; Hong Kong - 93 Hong Kong dollars (all above are per 100 national currency yuan). The exchange rates listed by HSBC were the same as the Central Bank's. The above exchange rates for each country are standard prices, and the foreign exchange departments of various banks settle accounts according to the prices listed by the Central Bank. Therefore, the foreign exchange rate is considered stable.</p>

<p>An announcement was issued yesterday: The period for the overall closing of various industries in 1935 is approaching. The Qian Industry Association not only sent letters to its members, the money houses, but also announced in the market: "To whom it may concern, the proposal regarding the handling of business before and after the overall closing, proposed at the third regular meeting of the third session of member representatives, has been approved. The resolution is listed below. The overall closing period for 1935 has been set (resolution) for January 23rd. According to regulations, there will be a four-day holiday from the 24th to the 27th to organize everything, and this four-day period will be for the dismissal period. Resolution on the interest issue before the overall closing: 2.5 yuan. Resolution on the ticket collection period: ticket collection will start from January 19th and end at 4:00 PM, and ticket returns will be extended by one hour as usual.

<p>The atmosphere in the exchange is still strong, and securities have fallen sharply. Yu Zuoting, chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, standing committee member Jin Runxiang, member of the National Debt Fund Custody Committee Wang Xiaolai, and secretary Kang Hou, were summoned by telegram by the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance. After going to Beijing the day before yesterday, they returned to Shanghai on the Beijing-Shanghai night express train at 11:00 PM that night. The train was originally scheduled to arrive at Shanghai North Station at 7:00 AM yesterday morning, but due to the cold weather, the train was delayed by 25 minutes and arrived at 7:25 AM. A reporter from the New Voice News met Yu, Jin, Wang, and Lin at the North Station. According to them, after arriving in Beijing, the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Weng Wenhao, and the Deputy Chairman of the Executive Yuan presented three reasons why it was impossible to reduce interest rates and postpone public bonds. Minister Kong and others attached great importance to this matter. The reporter also asked if the reduction of interest rates and postponement of public bonds was due to a misunderstanding, but the four of them made no comment.</p>

<p>Rumors Unabated in the Trading Market, All Securities Plunge: Since the securities market of the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange was filled with rumors of reduced interest rates and postponement of public bonds, the prices of various public bonds and bonds have plummeted across the board. After the market opened yesterday morning, the Ministry of Finance responded to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's telegram requesting protection of public bond credit, stating that the government would resolutely consolidate debt credit and hoped to earnestly convey this message to merchants and people, urging them not to be exploited by speculators and to avoid self-inflicted panic. However, the rumors of reduced interest rates and postponement of bonds in the market have not subsided, resulting in a continued plunge in the prices of various public bonds and bonds. As a result, the demobilization bonds and the 19th year rehabilitation bonds fell to 4 yuan and trading was suspended. The remaining 20th year consolidated tax, financial, and short-term bonds all fell by several jiao to 2-3 yuan. Trading was very heavy, and brokers requested that each session be reduced by one round in both the morning and afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Ministry of Finance to Establish Large-Scale Storage Warehouses in Datun <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Seeking National Food Self-Sufficiency: The National Economic Council, in view of the frequent floods and droughts in recent years, the emptiness of food reserves, and the opportunistic imports of foreign rice, resulting in a trade deficit of as much as 70 million yuan, believes that China, as a rice-producing country, is instead being flooded by foreign rice. If measures are not taken to strive for self-sufficiency, the future will be even more unthinkable. Therefore, it specially consulted with the Executive Yuan's Rural Reconstruction Committee and relevant ministries, and it was decided to establish a General Administration of Food in Shanghai to control the scattered and unfounded imports of foreign rice that disrupt the market, and to plan to establish a large-scale national grain storage warehouse in Jiujiang, Jiangxi Province. In order to streamline authority and achieve practical results, it was also decided that the Ministry of Finance would be fully responsible for this matter. The Ministry of Finance began preparations for the establishment of the Administration in Shanghai last year, and once summoned leaders of the Shanghai rice industry, such as Gu Xinyi, to Beijing this month to discuss management methods. After returning to Shanghai, Gu stated that the government's measures were aimed at seeking food self-sufficiency, and the establishment of a large-scale storage warehouse in Jiujiang was no longer a problem. If this is the case, then the confusion in the rice market in the future can be permanently stabilized.</p>

<h3 id="e102">The Academia Sinica Held a Memorial Service for Ding Wenjiang Yesterday, with More Than 200 People Attending, Including Wu Tiecheng and Gu Mengyu, and President Cai Yuanpei Representing Zhou Ren as the Chief Mourner. Zhang Junmai and Cao Liangxia Also Gave Speeches. <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Academia Sinica held a memorial service for the late Secretary-General Ding Wenjiang at 2:00 PM yesterday, separately in Nanjing and Shanghai. President Cai Yuanpei personally served as the chief mourner. The details of the memorial service in Shanghai are recorded as follows: Venue Arrangement: The memorial service venue was in the auditorium of the Institute of Physics and Chemistry Laboratory of the Institute of Engineering on Bailinan Road. In the center was a portrait of Sun Yat-sen and a portrait of Ding Wenjiang. National flags and party flags were hung on the left and right, and the stage was filled with more than 20 wreaths presented from various parties. Many couplets and tents were hung on the four walls. The arrangement was simple and appropriate. At the entrance was a white cloth banner with the words "Memorial Service for the Late Secretary-General Ding Zaijun." There were also many greeters to guide and receive guests.</p>
<p>Attendees included Wu Tiecheng, Jiang Baili, Zhang Junmai, Gu Mengyu, Wang Jingqi, Hu Dunfu, Wang Yunwu, Zou Bingwen, Xu Xinliu, Yang Xiaoshu, Chen Guangfu, Cao Liangxia, Zhou Zijing, Xu Weiman, Zhuang Changgong, Zhao Shuyong, Qu Shaoqi, Gao Mengdan, Li Zuyu, Li Dachao, Huang Suchu, Zhang Diesheng, and other colleagues from the institute in Shanghai, approximately 200 people in total. Mayor Wu Cheng-tie, accompanied by Li Dachao, arrived at the meeting at around 2:00 PM. Due to other matters, he paid his respects to Ding's portrait and then left.</p>
<p>Portrait of Mr. Ding Wenjiang</p>
<p>Memorial Ceremony: The meeting began at 2:30 PM, with Cai Yuanpei (represented by Zhou Ren, Director of the Engineering Research Institute) as the chief mourner. The order was as follows: All stand in silence; Pay the highest respect to the party and national flags and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen; The chairman respectfully reads Sun Yat-sen's will; Silence; Bow three times to Mr. Ding's portrait; Present wreaths; Silence (all factories stop for five minutes); President's speech; Report on Mr. Ding's life; Family's words of thanks; Ceremony completed.</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei's Speech: President Cai Yuanpei of the institute was unable to attend due to hosting the Nanjing memorial service, so Zhou Ren read Cai's written speech on his behalf: "Today's meeting is a meeting for the Academia Sinica to mourn Mr. Ding Zaijun, the Secretary-General of the institute. Mr. Ding was a man who valued substance over form and hated formalism. In his will, he forbade the sending of obituaries and holding of condolence ceremonies. Therefore, we respect Mr. Ding's original intention and do not hold a large-scale joint memorial service, but only limit it to the colleagues of our institute, and hold it simultaneously in Beijing and Shanghai this afternoon to avoid the hardship of colleagues traveling back and forth. Mr. Ding was an expert in geology and also studied geography, anthropology, and eugenics. He was both knowledgeable and precise, and his reputation has long been established. He also had the ability to manage affairs, supported the Geological Survey, reorganized the Department of Geology at Peking University, and managed the Beipiao Coal Mine, all using scientific methods and achieving remarkable results. Mr. Ding was not yet fifty years old. If he had another ten or twenty years of work, his contributions to academic undertakings would be limitless. Unexpectedly, he fell ill and passed away. The loss to China's academic undertakings is immeasurable. Speaking within the institute, Mr. Ding served as the Secretary-General of our institute for less than two years, but his relationship and contribution to the institute were significant. For example, the organization of the Review Committee, the establishment of the Fund Custody Committee, and the demonstration of the budget proposals of various institutes have all laid a firm foundation for the institute. The improvement and expansion of various institutes within the institute also bear indelible merits. Furthermore, the plan for the Central Museum and the construction of the Cotton Textile Dyeing Experiment Hall are major projects of cooperation between the institute and other cultural institutions. Although completion is still pending, the rough outline has been established, which is also the result of Mr. Ding's efforts. If he had been given more time, I do not know what kind of progress he would have made. Now that Mr. Ding has suddenly left, is our institute not suffering a major blow? Mr. Ding was a pure scientist. He never tolerated the superstitions of religious figures or the fantasies of metaphysicians. Therefore, we dare not praise Mr. Ding with the immortal spirit passed down by religious figures and metaphysicians. We believe that Mr. Ding's immortal spirit will forever remain in the consciousness of those who die later. If we, who die later, can maintain the academic achievements that Mr. Ding has already built and enrich the academic achievements that Mr. Ding has not yet completed, then Mr. Ding will live on even though he is dead. When we colleagues mourn Mr. Ding, we must establish this ambition to be worthy of Mr. Ding and not betray our original intention of participating in the memorial service."</p>
<p>Report on Mr. Ding's Life: Zhuang Changgong, Director of the Institute of Chemistry, reported on Mr. Ding's life, stating that Mr. Ding was a native of Taixing, Jiangsu. He was exceptionally intelligent at an early age and had the reputation of being a child prodigy. At the age of fifteen, he studied in Japan, and then went to England and Germany to specialize in geology, earning a doctorate degree. At the age of twenty-five, he returned to China from Europe, detouring through the provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou to conduct on-site investigations of the geology of the southwest, pioneering the way for later scholars to investigate the geology of the southwest. In the first year of the Republic, he worked in the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, initiated the Geological Survey, served as the director of the institute himself, and concurrently served as a professor in the Department of Geology at Peking University. For ten years, he advocated investigation and made unique contributions. In the eleventh year of the Republic, he managed the Beipiao Coal Mine, and his achievements were remarkable. In the fifteenth year of the Republic, he left Beipiao and took office as the Shanghai Songhu Business Commissioner, and his political achievements were particularly remarkable. After the sixteenth year of the Republic, he returned to the north and served as a director of the Cultural Foundation and compiled a detailed map of China, and set off to investigate geology. After the eighteenth year of the Republic, he served as a professor at Peking University, until the twenty-third year when he took the position of Secretary-General of this institute. He wrote many books in his life, which are currently being compiled. Mr. Ding was not only a geologist and scientist, but also a manager and a leader. He was the most patriotic person. Now that Mr. Ding has passed away, it is a loss for the entire country of China.</p>
<p>Guest Speeches: Following the guest speeches, (1) Zhang Junmai said that Mr. Ding had both scientific knowledge and enthusiasm for management, which was truly rare and valuable. His life's work will last forever. To commemorate Mr. Ding, his colleagues should recognize his achievements. (2) Cao Liangxia said that Mr. Ding was not only scientifically profound but also morally noble. We should learn his noble morals so that China can be revived. Finally, Ding Wenhao, a member of the family, delivered a thank-you speech, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Lamentations from All Quarters: Yesterday, those who sent wreaths included Mayor Wu, Ye Zhuotang and Ling Hongxun of the China Science Society, Zou Bingwen, and more than 20 institutes, including the institute and various research institutes, which were all displayed in the venue. There were also many elegiac couplets and elegiac tents. Excerpts are as follows: Gu Mengyu: "If it were not for my old friend, perhaps I would not have arrived here at this time, to mourn and to bid farewell. Looking at Yunshan, I painfully remember the past and become an eternal regret." "And in the future, who will be able to use what they have learned to benefit the world? I am shocked and afraid to hear the sound of the Xiang River sobbing." Zhang Junmai: "Although science and metaphysics argue about right and wrong, the difference between righteousness and profit is the same as Zhu Xi and Lu Xiangshan." Wang Yunwu: "Geological research has turned into an elite spirit at the foot of the prison mountain. A genius cannot be obliterated and will forever leave a reputation to be broadcasted in Shengao." Zhang Yuanji: "The earth does not love treasures, but suffers. If he could fully display his talents, he would surely benefit our country." "When he reaches the age of knowing destiny, he should be able to serve in government, but why is he taken away like this? I still want to ask the heavens." Shi Zhipai: "He was brave in traveling and his ambitions far surpassed Xu Xiake." "Where did he die? Where was he buried? He traced the footsteps of Liu Ji Lun."</p>
<p>Decision to Establish a Scholarship: A reporter from Shanghai News asked Mr. Xu Weiman, the secretary of the institute, yesterday about the measures to commemorate Mr. Ding. According to him, it was decided to establish (1) a social science scholarship to commemorate Director-General Yang, and (2) a geology scholarship to commemorate Director-General Ding. It is currently estimated that Ding Xielin, Zhou Ren, Fu Sinian, Zhu Kezhen, Tao Mengzhi, and Xu Weiman will draft the measures, and it is planned to allocate 2,000 yuan each year to award to the geologist and social scientist in the country who has made the greatest contribution and conducted the most thorough research.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Joint Rent Reduction Association of Various Districts Presents to President Chiang: Please Issue a Clear Rent Reduction Order <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Joint Rent Reduction Association of various districts of this city, yesterday, again presented to President Chiang of the Executive Yuan, requesting the issuance of a rent reduction order. The original text stated: "Presented to request a swift order from the Municipal Government to issue a rent reduction order, in order to revitalize the market and stabilize society. It is humbly noted that since Shanghai has been affected by the global economy, all industries have declined, and industrial and commercial firms are closing down daily. Even those still operating are barely maintaining themselves. Unemployment and suicides are frequently seen. The suffering of the citizens cannot be fully described by pen and paper. Shanghai is the leading city in the country, a place where merchants from various countries gather. Therefore, during periods of economic prosperity, social development and goods also increase in price accordingly, and the living standards of the citizens also rise daily. Since the Shanghai War, the market has been sluggish everywhere, commerce has plummeted, unemployment has increased daily, and land prices have tragically fallen by half, with no one paying attention. However, all kinds of commodity prices have also fallen automatically, but most landlords disregard everything and stubbornly refuse to reduce rents, causing the suffering of all the city's tenants to not be alleviated at all. Since the establishment of the Rent Reduction Association, we have repeatedly appealed to the authorities, but not only is there no hope of rent reduction, but also an increase in tenants' lawsuits. Most landlords disregard humanity, using one-sided arguments to sue in court, using money and power to arbitrarily seize property. Although we previously received a reply from Your Excellency to be handled by the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Municipal Government has not yet expressed its position. Under the current market conditions, is it appropriate and reasonable for citizens to request rent reduction? Should the local government also devise methods to adjudicate? This Association dares to represent all the city's tenants and again earnestly requests Your Excellency to quickly determine a solution, or order the Shanghai Municipal Government to earnestly handle it. We have always admired Your Excellency's concern for the people's hardship, and we are confident that what is presented will be accepted. This would be a great kindness. Respectfully presented."</p>
<h3 id="e104">Telephone Problem Meeting: Yesterday, a Petition Was Submitted to the Public Works Department; Zhong Si Received Them and Promised a Written Reply, Stating that Dismantling Telephones Was a Foolish Move <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Special District Telephone Problem Committee of this city, due to the issue of telephone price increases in the concession, which have been approved by both the Public Works Department of the Public Concession and the Board of Directors of the French Concession, and scheduled to take effect on March 1st of this year, the deadline is approaching. Therefore, based on the decision of the first board meeting, representatives Lu Wenzhong, Zhang Yichen, Gu Wensheng, and Li Ao Kui, four people, were sent to the Public Works Department to submit a petition yesterday morning, requesting that the overall situation be considered and the new system be reconsidered to benefit the citizens. General Manager Zhong Si received them and replied, saying that the telephone company's new fee system has already been approved by the Public Works Department's board of directors, and it is difficult to overturn. If citizens express their opposition by dismantling telephones as a countermeasure, the company's future income will gradually decrease, and the remaining telephone users will inevitably increase their burden. Moreover, telephones are a convenient tool for communication, and anyone, for their own needs, would not want to be without them and suffer significant losses in their business. Therefore, I can assert that no one would take such a foolish move. The representatives of the committee, seeing that the petition yielded no results, will convene a meeting of representatives from various organizations after receiving the Public Works Department's written reply to discuss countermeasures. If necessary, a general meeting of citizens and users will be convened to discuss strict and effective countermeasures.</p>

<p>Since the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau launched simple life insurance, its business has developed rapidly due to its generous benefits and simple procedures. In order to promote group insurance, the bureau has established group insurance measures. All agencies, companies, banks, factories, schools, and other groups with 15 or more people who wish to take out insurance will be charged at 95% of the original amount to show preferential treatment. In recent days, various public and private groups have been eagerly requesting brochures and contacting the bureau for insurance, which has led to an increasingly busy workload for the bureau. It is also heard that the Ministry of Communications, in view of the fact that simple life insurance can directly protect the social economy and indirectly promote construction, which is of great benefit to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and should be promoted urgently, has issued a special order to all agencies and employees under its jurisdiction to join the insurance program. Currently, the Shanghai Savings and Remittance Bureau, the Postal Bureau, the Telephone Bureau, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are processing the joining procedures. In addition, the Ministry of Communications is also requesting the Executive Yuan to instruct all agencies and employees nationwide to join as a model.</p>

<p>President's Address</p>
<p>Following proper protocol, President Kong Xiangxi delivered his opening speech, which stated, in brief: (1) Gratitude to All Sympathetic Individuals: Ladies and gentlemen, today is the day of our association's 7th annual meeting. Your presence and participation greatly encourages and deeply moves myself and my colleagues in the association. Our association was founded on April 4th of the 17th year of the Republic (1928). Now, we have more than seven years of history. In the beginning, our work focused mainly on rescuing children. However, now, our work has increasingly expanded. The general office is now divided into five groups: (1) General Affairs, (2) Relief, (3) Protection, (4) Hygiene, and (5) Education. Additionally, we have five affiliated institutions: (1) Philanthropic Clinic, (2) Philanthropic Nursery, (3) Philanthropic Training Institute, (4) Philanthropic Sanatorium, and (5) Chanbei Civilian Training Institute. These institutions provide medical care for children and carry out various practical works for the welfare of children. This is vastly different from the beginning. However, the association's ability to achieve these accomplishments is largely due to the assistance of many sympathetic individuals in society. They have supported the association in various ways with their spirit, their time, and their money. Therefore, the association is able to be where it is today. As the president of this association and one of the original founders, I must express my most sincere gratitude and deepest respect to these friends who have always supported the association. (2) Child Welfare is a National Salvation Undertaking: Ladies and gentlemen, recalling the beginning, why did Dr. Kuang Fuzhao, Dr. Luo Yunyan, Mrs. Guo Bingwen, Ms. Ding Shujing, Ms. Wang Liming, Mr. Gao Fengchi, and I initiate the Chinese Philanthropic Association for Child Welfare? Needless to say, we naturally wanted to use this organization to carry out child welfare. However, I would like to ask everyone to note that we are absolutely not handling child welfare as a charitable undertaking. Instead, we are handling it as a social and national salvation undertaking. Charitable undertakings are naturally commendable, but they are ultimately passive rather than active. Although a small part of the work carried out by this association is of a passive nature, such as rescuing disaster-stricken children in various places and saving abused maids, most of the work is of an active nature, such as promoting children's health, promoting children's education, promoting parental education, and promoting the use of the latest scientific methods to educate and nurture children nationwide. The association hopes not only to free children across the country from disaster and abuse, but also to ensure that children across the country have healthy bodies and sound minds in order to create a healthy Republic of China. Therefore, the work carried out by this association is naturally a far-reaching and national salvation undertaking, not just a passive charitable undertaking. Promoting children's happiness is naturally our goal, but our ultimate goal is to promote the happiness of the Chinese nation and complete the new construction of the Republic of China by promoting children's happiness. I would like to solemnly state this point to everyone at this annual meeting, and I believe that everyone will certainly be able to sympathize with and approve of this point. (3) The Importance Attached to Child Welfare in Various Countries Around the World: The foundation of a country naturally lies in its people. However, if a country does not first have healthy children, how can it produce healthy citizens? And how can it produce a healthy country? From this, we can know that if we want to build a healthy country, we must first cultivate healthy children. In other words, we must first complete the child welfare undertaking. Modern powerful countries around the world all attach great importance to child welfare. For example, the United States has a Children's Bureau, Austria has a Children's Protection Bureau, France has a Children's Protection Division, Italy has a General Association for the Protection of Mothers and Children, and Soviet Russia has a Headquarters for the Protection of Mothers and Children. In addition to establishing child protection agencies, governments around the world have successively formulated and promulgated many child protection laws, such as the Children Act in the United Kingdom, the Child Protection Act in the United States, the Child Rearing Act in France, the Juvenile Court Act in Germany, the Maternity and Child Act in Soviet Russia, the Maternity Protection Act in Italy, the Juvenile Act in Japan, and the Unified Regulations for Child Protection Undertakings in Belgium. Other countries attach great importance to child welfare. Looking back at our country, what is the situation? The reason why they are strong and we are weak lies in this. Recently, Stalin in Soviet Russia has incorporated all children in the country into the Children's League and the Youth League. Hitler in Germany has incorporated all children in the country into the Boy Scout Troop and the Youth Troop. Mussolini in Italy has incorporated all children in the country into the Balilla and the Vanguard. This fact should also be noted by those in China who are engaged in child welfare. After the Great War in Europe, President Hindenburg of Germany proposed a new budget in Congress, requesting more money to be spent on children. He solemnly said, "We have already lost everything in the World War. Now, we must never lose our children again." Thinking of China, in the past fifty years, we have lost many lands and many honors. How can we lose our children again? For the sake of our children, we should spend more money! (4) Conclusion: Today is the day of our association's 7th annual meeting. Our association sincerely hopes to take this opportunity to deeply reflect on the past and deeply strive for the future. My colleagues and I are aware of our limited knowledge and ability, so we are very willing to accept the criticisms and suggestions of all sympathetic individuals. We also ask those of you present today to not hesitate to correct us and give us guidance. This is what myself and my colleagues in the association earnestly hope for.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu's Speech</p>
<p>Xu Shiying's speech: Mr. Chairman, esteemed gentlemen, today is the 7th annual meeting of the Chinese Philanthropic Association for Child Welfare. I am able to participate, and I am honored that the assembly has called upon me to say a few words. The achievements of this association in the past seven years are evident to all, and there is universal praise. I need not elaborate further. Under the guidance of President Kong and Mrs. Kong, such progress has been made in these short seven years, which is truly admirable. Judging from the enthusiastic and inspiring atmosphere of today's meeting, and extrapolating from the past to the future, the future of the Philanthropic Association for Child Welfare is bright and can be anticipated. I, Shiying, am responsible for a part of social relief in the government. Regarding the operation of such a social organization that contributes to the public, benefits the nation, and helps the country, I feel very close and very envious in addition to admiration and prayers. In the past, the starting point of China's relief efforts was mostly based on sympathy, and it was not felt to be a sacred duty. The effect was mostly temporary and passive almsgiving, rather than a permanent and active cultivation of the strength of the country and the nation. The target was often scattered, and the organization was often lax. There was little division of labor and cooperation to achieve maximum efficiency. In recent decades, there have been scientifically managed charitable organizations and relief functions that go deep into society and focus on production. Everyone has come to realize that almsgiving cannot cultivate poverty and weakness, and has further carefully selected relief targets so that social forces can be used more permanently for the benefit of the country and the nation. This is what Shiying deeply admires and is comforted by. Among all these social organizations, the Chinese Philanthropic Association for Child Welfare is the most representative one. I will not elaborate on the importance of child relief, but in my humble opinion, the recent three to five decades of the Chinese nation may be more important in history than any era. Today's children can be said to be the masters of this stage. Therefore, it goes without saying that everyone in China today should do their best to carry out child welfare work. I hope that this annual meeting will take on the responsibility of leadership, so that all people in the country, regardless of gender, age, or status, can directly or indirectly become members of the child welfare team, inherit the past and usher in the future, and have a new atmosphere. In this sense, allow Shiying to once again congratulate the Chinese Philanthropic Association for Child Welfare on its future success. Confucius said, "Treat the elderly of your own family in the way they should be treated, and extend that treatment to the elderly of other families; treat the young of your own family in the way they should be treated, and extend that treatment to the young of other families." Although Shiying is old, I dare not ask you to treat the elderly of your own families, but I will always follow and strive to treat the young of your families, even though my strength is limited. Thank you all.</p>

<p>Closing Speech</p>
<p>After the above elections were completed, the chairman introduced Mayor Wu Tiecheng to deliver a speech, stating briefly: After listening to the association's report on its affairs in the past year and the implementation outline for the 25th year, I was extremely excited and felt very admirable. In ordinary Chinese society, there are some men and women who are not only indifferent to other people's children, but also hold an indifferent attitude towards their own children. Since the establishment of the Chinese Philanthropic Association for Child Welfare, due to the influence of its work and publicity, the general public has gradually become aware that not only is it important to educate and nurture one's own children, but it is also recognized that child welfare means not only educating and nurturing one's own children, but also extending it to others, to educate and nurture ordinary children in society who have lost education and care. In this regard alone, the contribution of the Philanthropic Association for Child Welfare is not small. We are in a time of national crisis. If we do not talk about saving the country, then if we talk about saving the country, how to cultivate the vitality of the nation is a major issue at present. What is the vitality of the nation? It is the general children. If we can educate and nurture children well today, we will surely have healthy citizens and a healthy country in the future. Otherwise, if we listen to their loss of education and care and do not try to save them, then the future of our country will be even more unimaginable. Looking around the world today, those so-called populous and culturally backward nations are all subject to the minority nations with superior culture. Then, what is the point of we Chinese boasting about our 400 million population? If the education level of a country is low, then it can be said that there is no one available. Today, we must have a deep awareness. The Chinese Philanthropic Association for Child Welfare takes the education and nurture of children as its responsibility, and bears the mission of saving the country and revitalizing the nation. Therefore, all of us who are citizens should do our best to assist it so that it can complete this great mission, he said. After Mayor Wu's speech, Mrs. Robert, the representative of the American Philanthropic Association for Child Welfare, Xu Shiying, the chairman of the National Relief Commission, Cai Hongtian, the representative of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, and Chen Lengseng, the representative of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, etc., gave speeches one after another, with many pertinent remarks. Finally, a group photo was taken and refreshments were served before the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e111">The French Municipal Council Applied for Land Tax; Wu Honggen Argued with the Articles of Association Notice; The Notice Clearly Stated that Chinese People Would Not Be Charged Taxes; Gu Shouxi and Others Appeared in Court for Unsuccessful Mediation <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The tax office of the French Municipal Council recently stated that a piece of land located at No. 1412, Xiafei Road, inside the lane, with French certificate number 12767 B, measuring two mu, one fen, seven li, and six hao, along with the buildings on it, is owned by local Wu Honggen. The land price was estimated at 34,000 yuan per mu in 1934. According to 8 per thousand, the land tax was levied. The land tax due for the three periods from 1933 to 1935 was a total of 353 yuan, 2 jiao, and 8 fen. In addition, the house tax for May and June of last year was 39 yuan, of which 24 yuan and 8 jiao is still owed. From July to October, the total of 4 months is 78 yuan, totaling 102 yuan. The total amount owed is 456 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 fen. Because the landlord Wu Honggen delayed and refused to pay, Gu Shouxi, Fei Xizhen, Yao Zhaodi, Yuan Jiahuan, and other lawyers were commissioned by Jia Tang (phonetic translation of the French Municipal Council's legal advisor) of the French Municipal Council to file a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Special Second Court in accordance with the law. Yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock, Judge Guo Huaipu summoned both parties in the Civil Division Seven Court to conduct a preliminary mediation. The applicant, the French Municipal Council, was represented by lawyer Gu Shouxi in court, and the respondent, Wu Honggen, was represented by lawyer Chen Wenxiang. First, the applicant's representative lawyer stated the case and the reasons for the mediation application. The respondent presented the articles of association and Shanghai Daoyin (道尹) and Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs of Jiangsu Province Yang Xiaochuan's notice issued when the French Concession was expanded in 1914 as reasons for their defense. According to Article 6 of the notice, "Chinese people residing in the French Concession and Wai Malu (外馬路), with cultivated land and houses, and houses of equal status, will not be charged donation taxes and other similar donations, and per capita tax regulations." The respondent's land had never been taxed since the concession was opened. As for the houses, which were old-style bungalows, 4 yuan and 9 jiao had always been paid per period and delivered on time, with the donation tickets issued. The respondent could not accept all of the applicant's requests. The applicant's representative lawyer also stated that when the concession was leased, it was all wilderness and farmland. The stipulation that farmland and houses on it would not be taxed was not the basis claimed by the respondent. The French consulate or the French embassy had records and original documents of the stipulations at that time, which could be submitted to the court for inspection. After verifying the words, the court declared that the mediation was unsuccessful and would be heard again. Then the court adjourned.</p>

<p>The Tongchun Garden Teahouse at No. 43, Maohai Road, suddenly caught fire at about 1:00 PM yesterday. The fire spread rapidly and was beyond control. The fire brigade arrived after hearing the alarm and extinguished the fire, destroying one floor. It is reported that a three-year-old girl was unable to escape and was burned to death in the fire.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Case of the Zhao Feng Pawnshop Partner Stealing Goods and Pawning Them Back <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Two of Three Suspects Were Arrested, One Escaped; The Fraud and Embezzlement Case Was Concluded. The Zhao Feng Pawnshop at No. 102, Xujiahui Road, French Concession, was opened by Guo Liangji (46 years old) from Zhejiang. He hired Zhao Xianlu (age unknown), Wang Yingjie (28 years old), and Cai Jixiao (17 years old), all from the same hometown, to manage the package room. Unexpectedly, Zhao, Wang, and Li recently came up with a novel idea and colluded to steal the goods from the package rack and pawn them outside. They then entrusted others to pawn the stolen goods back at the Zhao Feng Pawnshop (the money was divided up and spent). Only now was it discovered that after checking the package room's goods and books, it was found that Zhao and the others had started stealing and pawning goods from May 1st of last year to December 28th, totaling 288 cases, with a total value of 2,548 yuan. The shop owner immediately reported the information to the French police for investigation. Unexpectedly, Zhao and the others were well-informed and fled together. Subsequently, detectives Gao Hongxuan and Hou Benyong began an investigation and learned that Zhao and the others had fled to No. 100, Hefeng Road, Wusong Town in the city. On the 14th of this month, they rushed to Wusong and requested the assistance of the local public security bureau. At 5:00 PM, they went to the address and only arrested Wang Yingjie and Cai Jixiao. Zhao Xianlu had already fled after hearing the news. Wang and Cai were then taken back to the French police station and sent to the Special Second Court for interrogation and investigation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Chen Pusheng presided over the trial in the Criminal Division Eight Court. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahuan stated the case and filed a lawsuit based on the fraud crime in Article 339 of the Criminal Code. Then, the plaintiff stated the process of discovering the defendants' collusion in stealing and pawning the goods back. After questioning Wang and Cai, they confessed to the collusion. Wang admitted to dividing up 1,110 yuan, and Cai admitted to dividing up 200 yuan. They also confessed that Zhao Xianlu divided up 302 yuan. Finally, the police lawyer argued that the defendants were not only guilty of fraud, but also had related embezzlement in their business, and requested strict punishment according to law. After verifying the words in court, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentence for the 25th. The two defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Counterfeit Money Case Under Investigation After Initial Interrogation <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 10th of this month, Chinese and Western detectives from the French police arrested Yao Yunqi, a Nanhui native, at the intersection of Lafayette Road and Anna King Road for transporting counterfeit money. They also seized a large paper package containing 800 yuan of old-edition one-yuan counterfeit banknotes from the Bank of China that had been discarded. The next day, at No. 159, Qiale Road, they successively arrested eight men and women, including Chang Yuanyuan, Xia Chenshi, Ding Changhai, Ding Fangshi, Tang Haiding, Wang Fengshan, Zou Jueyuan, and Wu Haiyuan, and seized 21 yuan of the same counterfeit banknotes and over 100 counterfeit double coins, as well as over 10 liang of opium. They were sent to the Special Second Court for interrogation and investigation. Yesterday, Judge Li Changnian of the Special Second Court, accompanied by clerk Wang Baoxun, presided over the trial in the Criminal Division One Court. Only Ding Changhai and his wife, Ding Fangshi, hired lawyer Zhu Dianqing to defend them among the defendants. According to police lawyer Fei Xizhen, the police department requested an extension of the trial for another week because there were many defendants in the case and the investigation procedures were not yet complete. After reporting to the court, the court approved the postponement and scheduled the next hearing for the morning of the 25th. The defendants were still returned to custody.</p>

<p>Madam Lin Xiao, a Chaozhou woman residing at No. 12, Tongyi Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, had previously deposited 10,000 yuan in cash with the Sanxing Real Estate Company at No. 348, Edward Road, with the understanding that it could be withdrawn at any time. Recently, needing funds, she went to the company's manager, Zhang Yangzhou, at No. 3, Lane 220, Yanping Road, to withdraw the money. However, despite several attempts, she received nothing. On the 2nd of the month, accompanied by her relative Lin Li, she went to Zhang's house again at 9:10 AM. Zhang was not there, and Zhang's nephew, Chen Tongbiao, came out to greet them. Unexpectedly, a conflict arose during the conversation, and Chen violently shoved Madam Lin Xiao, causing her to fall to the ground. As she was nine months pregnant, she sustained injuries. She reported the incident to the Gordon Road Police Station and was sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment, being discharged only on the 5th. She then requested the police to prosecute Chen. The police repeatedly summoned Chen, but he failed to appear. Consequently, they petitioned the First Special District Court for a warrant. Yesterday, the warrant was served to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian explained the above situation, prosecuting Chen for causing injury under Article 277 of the Criminal Code, and stated that the plaintiff could not appear in court today as she had just given birth. Lin Li then recounted the circumstances of the incident. When questioned, Chen Tongbiao claimed, "I did not push the plaintiff down. The three of them beat me. I used my hands to block them, and the plaintiff was wearing high heels and accidentally fell. I was also injured," presenting a medical certificate as evidence. Judge Zhan Liangce reviewed the testimonies and sentenced Chen Tongbiao for causing injury, imposing a fine of fifteen yuan, commutable to one day of labor for each yuan. Chen expressed his willingness to accept the sentence.</p>

<p>Wang Zhengxiang, Chen Beilu, Wang Ziyu, and the woman Zhang Chaisi, all from Jiangbei, were found to be carrying eleven counterfeit fifty-cent coins each at 8:45 PM the day before yesterday, while passing near Zhoushan Road and Tangshan Road. Two Chinese constables, Nos. 1858 and 2258, found their behavior suspicious and apprehended them. All the counterfeit fifty-cent coins were confiscated and taken to the Huishan Police Station, where they were detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The Municipal Council's lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, recounted the events and requested a postponement to investigate the source of the counterfeit coins and apprehend the principal offender, hoping to uncover the manufacturing location. The coins were presented for inspection. When questioned, the defendants gave evasive answers. Judge Xiao ordered them to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Drug Trafficking Offense: Another Drug Trafficker Apprehended; Police File Charges Against "Hemp-Faced" Teahouse Owner, etc. Public Concession Judge Orders Handling According to Regulations, No Need for Transfer <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Sha Daqi, the squad leader of the Detective Division of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, recently apprehended a drug trafficker named Cao Zhongfan and discovered a pre-printed letter stating that morphine could be purchased from a "hemp-faced" teahouse owner at Room 26, Huzhou Inn, North Shanxi Road. He reported this to the bureau chief and, in coordination with Xie Guisheng, a Chinese detective of the Huishi Police Station, went to arrest the teahouse owner, Zhang Delin (the "hemp-faced" teahouse owner mentioned in the letter), a Huzhou native working as a tea server at the inn. They also apprehended Di Qingsheng from Shaoxing, Xu Maotou from Suzhou, and Chen Guitao and Zhang Dianchen from Shaoxing. When the detectives entered the room, Di pretended to go to the toilet and threw two packages of morphine into the toilet. The detectives discovered and retrieved them. Two ledgers were also found under Chen's hat, which Public Security Bureau personnel stated were records of drug sales. All were taken back to the police station and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng continued the hearing in the Fifth Criminal Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed charges under Article 263 of the Criminal Code. Representatives from the Public Security Bureau arrived in court, requesting a transfer of the case. Judge Huang stated that since the police had already filed a public prosecution, the case must go through the judicial process. Furthermore, the court would handle the case according to the anti-smoking and anti-drug regulations, which were the same as those in the inland areas. Therefore, the case did not need to be transferred for the time being. If the Public Security Bureau had sufficient evidence, they could submit it for the court's reference and assist the police in the investigation. If it was determined after the verdict that there were other offenses, evidence could be submitted for prosecution. The Public Security Bureau representative requested a written notice be sent to the Public Security Bureau and then withdrew. After questioning each defendant, Judge Huang, considering the case involved drug trafficking, instructed the police detectives on the points to be investigated and then adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Liu-Wu Adultery Case: Verdict Announced in Court Yesterday; Liu Xi's Criminal Suit Withdrawn by Liu Zirong; Wu Wenxiang Sentenced to One Year and Six Months, Appeals <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The sensational Liu-Xi/Wu Wenxiang love affair was adjudicated by the District Court yesterday. Wu Wenxiang was found guilty of seduction and sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment. Wu, dissatisfied with the verdict, immediately announced his appeal. Liu Xi's charges were withdrawn by her husband, Liu Zirong, in court, and Liu Xi was taken away by lawyer Tu, regaining her freedom. The preliminary trial concluded at this point. The details of the interrogation are as follows: Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the gallery of the Third Court was already full. Latecomers found no space to stand, and all stood on tiptoe waiting. When the bell rang three times, Judge Shao Qinzhi, Prosecutor Tang Rushu, and Clerk Xie Xirong entered the court and took their seats. The private prosecution lawyer Shan Yuhua, representing the plaintiff Liu Zirong, and the two lawyers Chao Kun and Tu Kunfan, representing the first defendant Liu Xi, and the lawyer Dong Banggan, representing the second defendant Wu Wenxiang, successively appeared in court. The court asked Liu Zirong about the extent of the out-of-court settlement. Liu replied that it was generally agreed upon, unconditional divorce, and the 5,000 yuan she brought out had also been arranged, but the expenses had not been discussed. The judge said, "Observing your settlement, neither party is sincere. Further delays are very detrimental to the defendant." Lawyer Tu rose and stated, "Requesting the court to grant Liu Xi bail and extend the period by ten days or a week to facilitate direct negotiations with the plaintiff for a smoother settlement." Prosecutor Tang Rushu immediately expressed his opposition, stating that the facts of the case were quite clear and simple. The settlement was a civil matter and should not involve criminal proceedings, which would affect the credibility of the court. Further delays were inappropriate, and the judge should promptly render a verdict. Judge Shao said to the defendant's lawyer, "The court could have concluded at the beginning, but further investigation was needed." Lawyer Tu rose and stated, "Requesting the court to allow our lawyers to take Liu Xi to the waiting room to discuss the settlement with Liu Zirong." The judge approved, and Liu Xi, Liu Zirong, and others left the court. After half an hour, the hearing continued. The court asked Liu Zirong if he could settle. Liu replied, "Withdrawing the charges against Liu Xi, and Wu Wenxiang should be severely punished according to law." Lawyer Shan rose and stated that the private settlement had been agreed upon (reportedly 5,500 yuan), and the money should be handled by Lawyer Tu. The clerk was requested to record it. As the private suit had been resolved and Liu Xi's charges had been withdrawn by Liu Zirong, Lawyer Shan and Lawyers Tu and Chao left first, and Liu Xi was taken away by Lawyer Tu. The court then said to Liu Zirong, "Please describe the circumstances of the discovery again." Liu replied, "I went to the police at 7:00 AM that day and broke into the pavilion room on the second floor, where I saw Liu Xi and Wu Wenxiang sleeping in the same bed. They were not ashamed and said it didn't matter, let's go to court." The court asked, "Did Wu Wenxiang seduce Liu Xi, or did Liu Xi seduce the chauffeur?" Liu replied, "Perhaps Wu Wenxiang seduced her, but she must have agreed to run away later. After Liu Xi and others left, the maids A Bao and A Jin also resigned, supposedly because Wu Wenxiang said to A Bao, 'We're leaving, so should you.'" Before Wu Wenxiang left, he flirted at my house, making it clear that he was fond of the young mistress, so I stopped him. The court asked, "Are there any civil matters with Wu Wenxiang now?" Liu replied, "No, I only seek his punishment." At this point, Prosecutor Tang Rushu rose and gave his argument. The court then instructed the defense to begin. Lawyer Dong rose and stated that in this case, Liu Xi and Wu Wenxiang were jointly liable. Now that Liu Xi's charges have been withdrawn by Liu Zirong, Wu Wenxiang should be declared not guilty. Wu Wenxiang's position was that of a servant, and he would not dare to have an affair with the mistress. Liu Xi was a married woman, not comparable to Huang Hui Ru's love affair with Lu Geng Rong. Moreover, Xi came from a wealthy family, how could she abandon her happy family to be in love with a poor chauffeur? If the court believes Wu Wenxiang is guilty, please grant him a suspended sentence. The court then asked Wu Wenxiang, "Did you rent the house?" Wu replied, "No." The court said, "Don't be evasive. Liu Xi's diary states that the day after renting the house, your sworn brother came to borrow money, and you told them the address. Now the court is giving you a chance, you should confess the truth." Wu Wenxiang refused to admit to the adultery with Liu Xi. The court, having heard the testimony, found the facts of the case to be very clear and declared the case closed, immediately sentencing Wu Wenxiang for adultery to one year and six months of imprisonment. Wu, dissatisfied with the verdict, was ordered to present the reasons and appeal according to law. He was ordered to be remanded in custody pending further instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Shanghai Telephone Bureau Increases Rental Fees for Intercoms: Shanghai-Minhang Company Requests Exemption from Increase of Over Five Times the Original Rate <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau has announced an increase in rental fees this month, with some rates increasing by four or five times. Various users find such a significant increase unaffordable. It was learned yesterday that the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Long-Distance Bus Company on Guohuo Road in this city has an intercom with a monthly rental fee of 10 yuan. Now, the monthly fee is to increase to 51 yuan, more than five times the original rate. The company sent a letter yesterday requesting an exemption from the increase, or else they will have the intercom removed immediately. The intercom lines are maintained by the users themselves, and the bureau's work is simpler than for ordinary telephones. Moreover, users are responsible for the wiring and installation costs when requesting installation. This significant increase seems unfair.</p>
<p>Recently, many Chinese and foreign industrialists have jointly raised funds to prepare for the Shanghai International Exposition, which will be open to all nationalities and will include agriculture, industry, commerce, and education, gathering the essence of all nations for the public to view. The scale of the exhibition, the breadth of the solicitation, and the grand purpose are unprecedented in China. It is said that the location has been selected in the eastern district of the Public Concession on a plot of land in the middle section of Yangshupu Road, bordering the road to the north and the Huangpu River to the south, covering an estimated area of over 200 mu. The internal construction has been entrusted to the local Qiming Architectural Firm and the British-owned Yuhua Foreign Company, who are designing and drawing plans. Construction is expected to begin soon. The exhibition period is tentatively set for two months, with the opening scheduled for June of this year. Chinese and foreign businesses have already begun contacting the organizing committee to arrange for exhibits.</p>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that there are plans to hold a large-scale exhibition in Shanghai in June or July of this year, covering the three sectors of industry, commerce, and education in Shanghai. According to Mr.鲍维尔, the civil engineer who will be supervising the construction of the venue, 2 million square feet of land has been rented on the Bund of the Public Concession for the venue. He spent five months handling the preliminary technical equipment. The drawings for the venue buildings have been completed by a German architect.</p>
<p>The *Shanghai Times* reports that the Shanghai Exhibition, which has been promoted for a long time, will be located on the old site of the Sanxin Yarn Factory on the Bund of Yangshupu. An office will be set up at No. 356, near Jing'an Temple Road and Ma Huo Road, in the coming days. Construction of the venue buildings will begin in March, and it is expected to open in early June. The exhibition period is tentatively set for June and July. If the results are good, there is a possibility of extending the exhibition. Negotiations are currently underway with the Municipal Council. It is said that the Council is very supportive of the plan, and the Works Department, Health Department, and Fire Department are willing to cooperate. The construction cost of the buildings is approximately 200,000 yuan. The Municipal Council's taxes on the property are approximately 3,000 yuan per month. The license fee is currently unknown. Once the buildings are completed, they will be rented to local businesses to display industrial, commercial, and educational items. The exhibition will also display items from other parts of China and overseas. The venue will also include a large amusement park with various games, such as dramas, movies, and dances, as well as various food stalls, which will also be contracted out. The admission fee is approximately 2 jiao or 2.5 jiao.</p>

<p>Lin Kanghou Delivers Speech on Behalf of the Presidium; Zhang Qun, Chen Jie, and Others Send Congratulatory Telegrams</p>
<p>The commemorative ceremony for Mr. Wang Xiaolai's 30th anniversary in Shanghai and his 50th birthday, initiated by Mayor Wu and others, was held at the Hu She on Guizhou Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. Prominent figures from all walks of life, including Yu Qiaqing, Zhu Ziqiao, Chen Aishi, Chu Minyi, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Lin Kanghou, Xu Shiying (represented by Huang Bodu), Pan Gongzhan, Wang Binyan, Yan Esheng, Wang Yansong, and Lu Jingshi, totaling over a thousand people, attended to offer their congratulations. Qiu Jianfei, Zhu Boyuan, Zhou Xiuquan, and Shi Menglan greeted the guests. After the formal ceremonies, Lin Kanghou delivered a speech on behalf of the presidium, followed by Wang Xiaolai's report on his 30 years in Shanghai, which stated that he was born on December 24th of the Bingxu year of the Guangxu reign. He began his business career in his youth, engaging in silk, tea, cocoon, and yarn, and also devoted himself to national, local, and social causes. He had five major endeavors in his life: National economy and people's livelihood, Local community affairs, Public welfare and charity, Educational and cultural endeavors, Industrial production. He stated that his aspirations have remained unchanged and consistent throughout. Yu Qiaqing then gave a speech, stating that Mr. Wang Xiaolai possessed these five major endeavors, and colleagues could follow in his footsteps. The only thing that could not be emulated was Mr. Wang's Heaven-bestowed blessing of a full house of descendants, which his colleagues could only admire from afar. The audience laughed. Chen Aishi then gave a speech, saying that when the National Revolutionary Army was about to arrive in Shanghai, the silver and money circles in Shanghai secretly raised funds, and Mr. Wang Xiaolai was the most active in this effort. The fact that the National Revolutionary Army was able to establish its capital in Nanjing was due to Mr. Wang's efforts. Yu Zuoting, Chu Minyi, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and others then gave speeches in succession. The ceremony concluded at 5:00 PM. Diplomats Zhang Qun, Chief Chen Jie, Relief Director Xu Shiying, and Cheng Yanqiu sent congratulatory telegrams. Mr. Wang's friends were all over the world, resulting in a constant stream of cars at the entrance of Hu She, making it a grand occasion.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Gang Members Turn on Each Other: Detectives Investigate the Truth Behind the Gang; Qian Cries Out "Zhou Da is Shooting!"; Qi Lao Dives into the River with His Gun; Seven-Year-Old Child Comes from Jiangbei <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>On the night of the 9th of this month, an internal dispute broke out among gang members at No. 63, Tong'an Lane, Matthews Road, resulting in gang members turning on each other. Jiangbei gangster Lü Zhenmin was shot and killed, and Yang Bangjie was wounded. Chinese and Western detectives from the responsible police station arrested a large number of suspected men and women in the case, including Yang Jinshi, Chen Bishu, and Qian Jinshan, a total of eleven people, and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention, as previously reported. It is now learned that after the court hearing was postponed the other day, the Chinese and Western detectives in charge of the case interrogated the suspects. The tenth defendant, Qian Jinshan, revealed that there were other accomplices hiding on boats in the river at Lan Road, Yangshupu. The Western detective chief Li Teh-hua, detective Zhu Mengwei, Zhu Hanbo, detective Pi Shaochang and others, along with Qian Jinshan, went to arrest them at 9 PM the day before yesterday. They also notified the Yangshupu police station in charge. As soon as the Chinese and Western detectives arrived at the riverbank of Lan Road, there were six or seven Jiangbei boats parked in the river. Not knowing which boat the gang members were hiding on, they were about to ask Qian to identify the boat to facilitate the arrest when Qian, cunning as he was, suddenly shouted, "Zhou Da is shooting!" Hearing the alarm, two gang members from the boat, armed with weapons, jumped into the river and tried to escape by swimming. The Chinese and Western detectives ordered them to stop, but they ignored the order. The detectives then fired at them, firing a total of nine shots, none of which hit. As a result, the two gang members managed to escape. Only Jiangbei native Zhao Cheng, the woman Qi Zhang, and her ten-year-old son Qi Buyou were arrested on the two boats, along with a seven-year-old girl who had been kidnapped. While the Chinese and Western detectives were searching for the accomplices, one of the gang members who had escaped by swimming, named Zhou Buyun, climbed out of the river and onto the opposite bank of Heilong Road. He was suddenly encountered by a Chinese constable No. 1949, who saw that Zhou was covered in water and had a white package in his hand, making him look suspicious. The constable also knew that detectives had been arresting thieves on the boats, so he ordered him to stop. Zhou ignored him and ran away. The constable then drew his gun and fired, hitting Zhou in the right leg. Zhou fell to the ground and was arrested, but the white package could not be found anywhere. The wounded bandit was sent to St. John's Hospital and then transferred to the police hospital for treatment. The arrested bandits Zhao Cheng and others were taken back to the police station. After investigation, it was learned that the other bandit who had escaped by swimming, named Qi Lao, was Qi Zhang's husband. It was also found that when the two bandits fled, they each carried a Mauser pistol with thirteen bullets. The guns and bullets were brought back to the police station. Yesterday morning, Zhao Cheng, Qi Zhang, and Qi Buyou were sent to the Eighth Court of the First Special Court, requesting that they be detained and tried together with the Yang Jinshi case. According to police lawyer Zhang Tianyin's statement, Qi Buyou was only ten years old, but the police had found that the defendants often used children to transport handguns when committing crimes, so he was suspected. The seven-year-old girl who was rescued claimed to have been kidnapped from Jiangbei. Because she could not state her name, she should be temporarily sent to the Women and Children Relief Association for care. When questioned, Zhao Cheng gave evasive answers. Qi Zhang confessed that the escaped Qi Lao was her husband. The seven-year-old girl was entrusted to her boat by Qian Jinshan from Jiangbei to be brought to Shanghai. Qi Buyou confessed that he had transported two handguns with another nine-year-old child. Judge Wu Zehan reviewed the testimony and ordered Zhao Cheng and others to be detained and tried together on the 31st of this month. The girl was allowed to be sent to the Women and Children Relief Association for care.</p>

<h3 id="e124">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Rewards 109 Crew Members: Each Receives One Month's Salary, Totaling 17,755 Yuan <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Since the head of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was changed to a Chinese national, with Shen Jiyun taking the position, the company has focused on the fundamental goal of recovering navigation rights for Chinese. Foreign crew members who had been hired at high salaries were gradually replaced with Chinese crew members. However, when the four new Hai-class steamships sailed to Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government insisted on using foreign crew members in order to issue passenger licenses. Shen Jiyun considered this action to be insulting to China's national dignity. He would rather give up the passengers from Hong Kong and insist on employing Chinese crew members. After a few months, the performance of the Chinese crew members proved to be better than that of the foreign crew members. The Hong Kong government was impressed and allowed the Haiheng, Haili, and Haizhen ships to carry Hong Kong passengers, setting a precedent for Chinese shipowners. The British government had never heard of such a thing before and sent a telegram to Hong Kong to inquire, as this matter was of great importance to China's shipping industry. Shen also emphasized crew members being responsible for their duties in order to reduce the various dangers and losses at sea. Therefore, in 1934, he formulated rules for crew members' leave, punishment, and rewards, using two years of service as the standard. If a crew member did not take leave during the two years, they would be rewarded. If they wished to take leave, their salary would be deducted on a daily basis. Since the implementation of these rules, they have greatly benefited maritime operations. Now that the two-year period has expired, crew members who have not taken leave should be rewarded. After a review of the results, 109 crew members were found to be eligible for rewards, including 10 captains such as Yang Xin, 15 chief mates, 6 second mates, 24 river pilots, 17 chief engineers such as Feng Yuming, 16 first assistant engineers, 10 second assistant engineers, 1 third assistant engineer, and 10 telegraph operators. In accordance with Article 9 of the leave rules, the above 109 people will each be rewarded with one month's salary, totaling 17,755 yuan in national currency. The list has been prepared and submitted to the board of directors for review, and will then be forwarded to the company's treasury for payment in the coming days. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has not had a system of rewards and punishments for a long time. The implementation of the two-year work performance assessment and the awarding of bonuses is the first time.</p>

<p>Since the Ningbo Industrial Bank Restoration Preparatory Office received the order from the Ministry of Finance to issue 20% cash payments to the Ningbo Industrial Bank's depositors in batches, due to the large number of depositors and cumbersome procedures, the second batch of payments up to 500 yuan was only completed yesterday. The process of issuing the third batch is now underway. The account books for each household with more than 500 yuan and less than 1,000 yuan are being checked, and notices will be sent out in advance. Depositors can bring their notice of receipt of funds, as well as all kinds of certificates, to collect the money from the 27th of this month. The Shanghai Guohuo Company, which closed at the same time as the bank, opened its doors on the 9th of this month to auction off its inventory. In the future, the Ningbo Bank Restoration Preparatory Office will also consult with prominent figures in Shanghai to lead the organization of the Shanghai Guohuo Company Restoration Committee, to raise capital and continue operations. It is now reported that substantial depositors of Ningbo Bank with more than 1,000 yuan, seeing the development of the Shanghai Guohuo Company's business during the auction to repay debts, which is unprecedented, know that the future of domestic goods is full of vigorous prospects. Moreover, this year is also the year for citizens to use domestic goods, and the Shanghai Guohuo Company is the main base for promoting domestic goods, with a considerable history. All want to invest. Most of the proposals for investment are in the Ningbo Industrial Bank's deposits. Except for the 50% of bank shares purchased that cannot be changed, the remaining 50% (in accordance with the restoration plan, 20% cash is returned, and 30% is fixed for two years) is willing to take out 10% in cash and change 40% into shares of the company. This proposal was put forward to the Restoration Preparatory Office. It is reported that the Office held a meeting to discuss and unanimously agreed to the proposal, as the purpose of the Preparatory Office is to preserve the interests of creditors. This proposal by the creditors fulfills the responsibility of promoting national goods, and is also of great benefit to the creditors themselves. Therefore, the office consulted with the Guohuo Company, which also agreed and promised to proceed accordingly.</p>

<p>The Chinese and Foreign Relief Association on Renji Road, because Chuansha, Chongming, Baoshan, Qidong, and Haimen were severely affected by disasters in 1931, immediately sent personnel to provide relief. The work has long been completed. The association recently received a letter from Gu Junnanqun, a representative of the Qidong County Relief Association, stating that in the autumn of the Guiyou year (1933), the coastal areas of Qidong were hit by two tidal disasters, and the cries of the suffering people were everywhere. Fortunately, with the help of the gentlemen of your association, who treated the hunger and drowning as if it were their own, raised funds for emergency relief, and the disaster victims were able to celebrate their rebirth. The merit is indeed the same as re-creation. Now that the relief work is coming to an end, we have prepared a plaque to respectfully send to you, in order to express our gratitude and to promote your benevolent spirit. Yesterday, Gu Jun personally sent the plaque to the association. The inscription on the plaque reads "Righteous Grain, Benevolent Broth" and the postscript reads, "In the autumn of the Guiyou year, the coastal areas of Qidong were devastated by tidal disasters. The homes were destroyed, and there was no food or clothing. Thanks to the enthusiastic rescue of the charitable gentlemen on the sea, who generously contributed to the cause, we are deeply grateful and have nothing to repay. Therefore, we have cast these words to show that we will never forget."</p>

<h3 id="e130">Arrest of Wanted Suspect in Kidnapping Case from Six or Seven Years Ago <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Yan Zizhang, a dye merchant, was kidnapped on July 17th of the 18th year of the Republic of China at 2:20 a.m. After leaving the Dadong Dance Hall on Yinghua Street with a famous prostitute, he was about to step into his own car when several kidnappers suddenly appeared. The Russian bodyguard hired by Yan attempted to resist, but the kidnappers opened fire, killing the bodyguard on the spot and wounding the prostitute. Yan was then kidnapped by the bandits and later released for a large ransom. Subsequently, the Public Concession Police arrested several suspects in the case, including Ni Afu, who confessed that a certain Yao from Shanghai was also an accomplice. Detectives went to Yuren Lane on Yunnan Road and the Yao family residence on Jiangjia Bridge on Kangnuot Road to arrest Yao, but were unsuccessful. A handgun was found at Yao's residence. The police department reported this to the former Provisional Court and obtained an arrest warrant for Yao, and Yao's photo was printed and distributed to various police stations for arrest. Many years passed, but Yao could not be apprehended. Recently, Chief Inspector Lu Liankui of the General Inspectorate and Detective Wang Chengying learned that Yao had fled to Zhenjiang, changed his name to Wang Fengqi, and opened the Mengyuan Hotel at 105 Zhonghua Road in Zhenjiang. Detective Wang, accompanied by Detective Zhang Lianhong, went to Zhenjiang and arrested Yao. He was brought to Shanghai the day before yesterday and escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special First Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the facts of the case, requesting that the defendant be detained because the police were retrieving the case files from various police stations that had previously handled the case. Yao admitted under questioning that he had changed his name and gone to Zhenjiang after the Yan case, but denied participating in the kidnapping of Yan. Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court, reviewed the confession and ordered Yao to be detained and interrogated again at a later date.</p>

<p>The Longhua Airport in this port is suitably located next to the ancient pagoda of Longhua Temple. The pagoda, which is dozens of feet high, is a natural landmark for the starting and ending points of air routes. However, during nighttime flights, there is a fear of accidental collision. It is now learned that the China and Eurasia airlines have specially requested the abbot of Longhua Temple, Xingding, to install twelve powerful electric lights on the top of the pagoda to facilitate nighttime flights. The monks of the temple also agreed immediately because the matter concerns the convenience of transportation. The two companies have already hired workers to install lights and wiring on the top of the pagoda and will complete the installation in a short period of time. At that time, it will shine brightly, and the ancient pagoda will emit great light.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Emergency Meeting of the Thermos Bottle Industry Association <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Thermos Bottle Manufacturing Industry Association recently convened an emergency meeting the day before yesterday to discuss relief measures for two major issues: the interruption of the source of the main raw material, domestic silver nitrate (i.e., silver powder), which affects the production of products, and the excessive cost of coal gas fuel (i.e., city gas). Gan Fengnan chaired the meeting as usual. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, and then the discussion of the cases was recorded below: 1. Regarding domestic silver nitrate, since the government explicitly ordered the reform of the legal currency system, raw silver can no longer be privately traded. This domestic industrial raw material will inevitably disappear from the market. However, the manufacture of our products relies entirely on silver nitrate as the only main raw material. Now that the source has been cut off, the impact on our industry's production is huge. How should we seek relief? Resolution: In this period of dumping of foreign goods and decline of domestic industries, our industry is planning to strive for development and cannot give up eating because of choking. The association should compile statistics on the annual demand of each factory of the industry and submit them to the government, requesting the allocation of raw silver. The association will prepare the price and collect it in order to manufacture it ourselves and maintain the industry. If necessary, representatives will be sent to Beijing to petition. 2. The annual coal gas fuel cost of each factory in the industry is huge, but the Shanghai City Gas Company not only charges exorbitant fees for fuel to the industry but also has extremely strict regulations. Although it has been repeatedly requested to reduce fuel costs, it has not been effective. How should this be handled? Resolution: In this situation of market depression and industry decline, this fuel cost accounts for almost 50% of all expenses, which is a major reason for the industry's depression. Since the request for reduction has not been effective, the association should plan to set up a joint self-operated coal gas factory or solicit specialized talents to study other substitutes in order to save expenses and reduce the cost of products. 3. Recently, the purchase prices of various raw materials have soared. Should the market price of our industry be raised to maintain capital? Resolution: A general meeting will be convened again before the spring opening to discuss it. 4. The non-member factories have been repeatedly urged to pay the monthly fee in accordance with the law, but they still refuse to pay. How should they be dealt with? Resolution: If they still refuse to pay after three months, legal action will be taken in accordance with the law. The meeting adjourned at more than 7 o'clock.</p>

<p>Youyou vs. Jewish team, the Group A league match was held yesterday at Shenyuan Stadium. The Jewish team lacked manpower and played with only nine players. Due to the disparity in strength between the two sides, the match became one-sided. Youyou won over Jewish team with a score of 6 to 1, and Jewish team suffered a miserable defeat. Yesterday's weather was severely cold, and the number of fans could be counted on one's fingers, with only about thirty people. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Nanzhen Scores the First Goal</p>
<p>As soon as the battle began, the Jewish team kicked off. Halfway through, Liang Shuye intercepted the ball, sent it far to the front line, and Zhen He Nanzhen shot three times, but failed to score. Feng turned the ball on the baseline, and the pass was just right. Zhen He added a shot, just hitting the arms of the goalkeeper Zhabo. Yuxiang did the same, but it was all in vain. Jewish center M. Greenberg launched a solo western invasion, but it was only a flash in the pan. After the ball hovered in the Jewish team's territory several times, Harry Sthing stumbled on the ball. Liu Shizan caught up and crossed the ball. Wang Nanzhen waited for the right moment, slightly nudged the ball, and it entered the net. Youyou scored the first goal, less than fifteen minutes after the start of the match. The kickoff from the center line immediately returned to the Jewish team's territory. Yuxiang and Nanzhen shot twice, but Zhabo rescued them from danger. Nanzhen got a corner kick opportunity, but Ping missed it himself. Nanzhen committed a foul and was penalized. Feng sent the ball out, and Yuxiang shot, just hitting the crossbar, and Zhabo turned it into a corner kick. Yong Sen opened the kick, and Shizan landed on the ball, deflecting it away. It hit the bullseye again, making the score 2 to 0.</p>
<p>First Half: Jewish Team Scores Zero</p>
<p>After the kickoff, Feng killed into the enemy's formation, forcing a corner kick. The Jewish team launched a counterattack once, but was still sent out. Zhen He is worthy of being an expert, dribbling past the front and rear guards, reaching the front of the goal, but unfortunately hit the post and bounced back. Youyou launched another siege, and Shizan took advantage of the chaos to kick the ball into the net again, scoring 3 to 0. The Jewish team tried hard to counterattack, but could not enter Youyou's territory at all. Hei Tan got the ball from Feng, but his shot missed the goal. Zhalin committed a foul, and instead of catching up, he kicked the ball with all his strength, just hitting the corner of the net. Then the Jewish team got an opportunity to attack, but Jiang Shanqing forced a corner kick. Daobo Laiji took the kick, and Rongcai kicked it out, but before he could make any progress, the whistle blew for half-time. In the first half, Youyou scored four goals, and the Jewish team scored zero.</p>
<p>6 to 1: Youyou Defeats the Enemy</p>
<p>Changing sides to fight again, the ball still hovered in the Jewish team's territory. Zhen He and Feng both shot, but both went over the crossbar. Hao Xueke dribbled the ball to attack, but as soon as he crossed the center line, he was intercepted by Zhen Xiang. Yuxiang dribbled the ball, and Zhabo撲地rescued him. The ball rolled into the net from his arm, making the score 5 to 0. The three forwards of the Jewish team advanced together, but Lao Jiang accidentally committed a foul and was penalized with a penalty kick. M. Zhabolin took the kick, just hitting the corner of the net, and Rongcai could not save it. Youyou lost a goal. Zhen He and Nanzhen fired in succession, but were both saved by Zhabo. Daobo Laiji attacked along the side, and Jiang Shanqing arrived from outside the Guan, forcing a corner kick. Youyou attacked again, and Yong Sen headed the pass, and Hei Tan's iron leg flew at the ball, sending it into the net again, making the score 6 to 1. The Jewish team was defeated.</p>

<p>Youyou B Wins Over Aurora: 5 to 2</p>
<p>Donghua B Wins Over Apellon: 9 to 3</p>
<p>Qinghua Wins Over Yousheng: 5 to 2</p>
<p>Youyou B Wins Over Aurora: In the second match of the Zilin Cup, Youyou faced Aurora yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at Hongkou Park. Aurora was a mixture of Chinese and Western athletes, while Youyou was a strong team in the previous cup competitions. Therefore, yesterday's match was quite exciting. In the first half, because Aurora's center Luo Gans did not play, Youyou scored four goals in a row. Although Aurora pulled back two goals in the second half, it was of no avail due to too many goals conceded. As a result, Youyou eliminated Aurora with a score of 5 to 2.</p>
<p>Donghua B Wins Over Apellon: In the Zilin Cup match, Donghua B faced Apellon yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at Jiaozhou Park on Jiaozhou Road. Donghua was eliminated in the preliminary cup competition after losing to Youyou, so they put all their efforts into the Zilin Cup. Therefore, yesterday's match was played with all the troops mobilized, attacking and defending together, and they were exceptionally hardworking. Although they deployed against the wind in the first half, they were still able to score four goals. In the second half, deploying with the wind, Apellon naturally felt even more overwhelmed. As a result, Donghua won with a score of 9 to 3.</p>
<p>Qinghua Wins Over Yousheng: In the Zilin Cup match, Qinghua faced Yousheng yesterday at the First Hongkou Stadium. In the first half, Qinghua's Ge Xizuo scored a penalty kick, taking the lead with a score of 1 to 0. In the second half, Yousheng's Chen Yan leveled the score. Soon after, Ge Xizuo broke Yousheng's goal from 20 yards away. Li Songyun again tied the score at 2 to 2. Later, Qinghua's Ge Xielin and the three forwards each made contributions, and Qinghua won over Yousheng with a score of 5 to 2.</p>

<p>Western Youth Basketball: Originally there were five games scheduled last night. The Western Youth vs. Guoguang's B team game was postponed due to some reason, so in reality, only two A team games and two B team games were played. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Suke Yu beat Tax Academy (B) First half 32 to 4, Total 42 to 14</p>
<p>Mai Ling beat Minqiang (B) First half 26 to 6, Total 56 to 17</p>
<p>Mai Ling beat Hujiang (A) First half 18 to 20, Total 66 to 29</p>
<p>Pirates beat Donghua (A) First half 19 to 10, Total 43 to 34</p>
<p>Mai Ling beat Hujiang: Hujiang's defeat was truly due to a lack of stamina and insufficient staying power. In the first half, Hujiang performed exceptionally well, taking the lead at every turn and winning with a score of 20 to 18. Unfortunately, in the second half, their strength failed them, allowing Mai Ling to seize the opportunity and surge ahead, almost to an uncontrollable situation. The final result was 66 to 29.</p>
<p>Mai Ling free throws: Scores</p>
<p>Hujiang free throws: Scores</p>
<p>Pirates beat Donghua: At the beginning, Donghua's momentum was quite strong. Feng Nianhua made repeated accurate shots. At the peak, the score was 16 to 7. Then, the Pirates replaced with the tall player Rhein, and the situation changed dramatically. The Pirates narrowed the gap tightly. The intense battle lasted until the end of the first half, resulting in a 19 to 19 tie. In the second half, the Pirates gradually showed their strength. Donghua also tried hard to rally. The fighting between the two sides was extremely intense. Later, Donghua adopted a strategy of half-defense and half-offense. Although the Pirates were brave, scoring was not easy. When time ran out, the score was 43 to 34. Donghua lost by nine points.</p>
<p>Pirates free throws: Scores</p>

<p>— Original by Louisa M Aleott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Huakunlan was the only person Pang Taomo felt he could trust to work in his "shop." So he taught Kunlan how to find eggs and deliver them safely, satisfied with just an apple or a date as a reward for his labor. The morning after Donn showed his strange expression on Sunday, Kunlan contributed the fruits of his labor from a major decision, saying to his master:</p>
<p>"Only two."</p>
<p>"Worse every day; Damn old hen, I've never seen one like it," Taomo roared, recalling the heyday when he often had six to collect, which made him smile often, truly unbearable to look back on. "Ah, put them in my hat, give me a little lead pencil, I want to write them down."</p>
<p>Kunlan then climbed onto a large basket and looked at the top of the machine, where Taomo had placed paper and pen. Kunlan said, "There's also a lot of money here."</p>
<p>"No, there isn't. How could I put money there randomly," Taomo replied.</p>
<p>"I see them—one, four, eight, two dollars," Kunlan insisted, still unable to figure out the numbers clearly.</p>
<p>"You're really an annoying little trickster!" Taomo said and climbed up the ladder himself to get the lead pencil, but almost fell down because he actually saw four bright, shiny four-dollar coins arranged neatly, with a piece of paper on top stating "For Pang Taomo" to avoid any mistakes.</p>
<p>"Heaven and earth are turned upside down!" Taomo shouted, then picked them up and immediately rushed into the big house, shouting frantically, "Everything is fine! The money is here! Where's Ned?"</p>

<h3 id="e170">Finance: Fluctuating and Crowded, Attempts to Raise Gold Prices Lack Strength; Morning Opening Up Four Yuan, but Ultimately Dropping Half a Yuan <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market continued its sharp decline. However, with large speculators facing unfavorable conditions and the market being crowded with bulls, the attempts to raise prices lacked sustained momentum. Major short sellers were able to repeatedly exert pressure, causing prices to gradually retreat after rising. It was observed that the morning's initial decline was due to a consistent and severe drop in the overseas silver markets in both the UK and the US. The large speculators claimed that after the market closed, the US was said to have absorbed a large number of speculators and the entire supply from India at the closing price. Forward silver prices in Mont de Piété remained unchanged or slightly decreased by up to 4%. Exchange rates slightly decreased, and London spot gold rose by one penny, which improved market sentiment. The Central Bank's official exchange rates were announced, showing no change for both the UK and the US. The customs gold unit rose by 4%, and the standard gold bar price was listed at 1145.9 yuan. In pre-market over-the-counter trading, prices briefly rose to 74 yuan due to purchases by Fu Xing Yong and Qian Yuan Yong. Fu Xing Yong, Yong Li, and Ding Kang took advantage of the high prices to sell at 2 yuan. Da De Cheng and Yuan Mao Yong even reached over 3 yuan. Ying Feng, Heng Fu Xing Yong, Da De Cheng, and Da Fa Yong, among others, sold off, causing prices to retreat to the 70 yuan level. The morning opening was still high, and prices hovered around 70 yuan. However, major speculators took advantage of the high prices to aggressively sell, shaking the will of the bulls and leading to a subsequent decline. The HSBC exchange rates were announced, showing no change for both the UK and the US. Banks engaged in mutual trading, keeping the domestic market stable. After the initial decline, there was considerable fluctuation, but the overwhelming number of bulls and the lack of momentum made it difficult to raise prices. As a result, major short sellers were able to exert pressure at times, gradually weakening the overall trend. The silver equalization tax was announced, decreasing by 4 points, bringing the tax rate to parity. This made it even more difficult to boost market sentiment. The bearish sentiment was strong, and the decline continued, but there was considerable struggle along the way. Day traders took advantage of the decline to buy, and buying activity increased after the initial drop, causing prices to rebound. At noon, the overall trend was uncertain, and prices fluctuated. Later, prices dropped slightly. The swap premium gradually evened out, with bulls offering 8.5 to 9 yuan for February and March. The spot price for March was over 11 yuan, and the three-month period was slightly under 13,000. Bulls still outnumbered shorts by 26. Looking ahead, the future is difficult to predict. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below.</p>

Hui Xiang, Qing Fa Yong, and Qian Yuan Yong supported Qia Feng Yong and Ding Kang, rising to 7.8 yuan. Although Ding Tai and Tong Feng Heng sold at 7.6 yuan, Qing Fa Yong, Ding Kang, and Yi Cheng still advanced to 7.5 yuan. Hui Xiang, Fu Xing Yong, Ri Chang, and Shun Mao sold off, dropping to 4.9 yuan. Although Qia Feng Yong advanced to 6 yuan, the silver equalization tax was announced, dropping 4 points to even. As a result, Fu Xing Yong and Yong Li Yuan Mao Yong bought at 3.7 yuan. Yong Li, Qia Feng Yong, Da De Cheng, Ri Chang, and Yuan Mao Yong saw the low prices and bought in, rising to 5.4 yuan.

Swaps were quiet. Fu Yu Yong offered Hui Xiang 7 shares at 8.5 yuan, with the overall trend between 8.5 and 9 yuan. 28 February contracts were transferred from Hui Xiang to Da De Cheng at 58.1 yuan, and another 28 contracts at 58.2 yuan.

The silver balance tax was announced to be four points lower, and the tax rate difference was flat. The psychology of Chinese merchants was slightly softened, and there was some outflow.

<h3 id="e173">Securities: Rumors Attack the Bond Market, Post-Demobilization Bonds Hit Limit Down, Major Struggle Between Bulls and Bears, Only Two Trading Sessions All Day <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange deteriorated even more severely, completely attacked by rumors of interest rate cuts or postponements. Both bulls and bears had extremely strong forces, resulting in a major competition and undertow. Market sentiment fluctuated, and discussions were complicated. After Finance Minister Kong's arrival in Shanghai, there was still no concrete indication regarding the issue of interest rate cuts on bonds. Telegrams from Beijing had ambiguous tones, making people feel even more confused. The financial community and the exchange authorities repeatedly held meetings and discussions, and most of them voiced opposition to this point. However, upon closer examination, the reasons were not sufficient. If interest rates were cut, the government's monthly income would increase by over one million, while the financial community would suffer a huge loss. Being afraid of hurting the government and the economy, the government should not do this. If it was a complete rumor, and the government did not clearly announce it, the confusion and unrest in people's hearts reached its peak. Although the major short sellers have already made profits, they are too big to fail and cannot make up for it, so they also feel difficulties. Therefore, if there is a simple and direct solution in the future, the market price will not be difficult to rise. Yesterday, only two sessions were still done. The opening pressure was extremely heavy. Demobilization bonds fell sharply by two yuan and five jiao and a half. The rest also uniformly fell by a small number of jiao to two yuan. The sellers were the most fierce with the twenty-first lot, and the rest, such as the fourth, eleventh, forty-third, fifty-fourth, and seventy-eighth lots, all had sales. There were more buyers in only the sixteenth, thirtieth year, and seventy-second lot, and the rest were mostly retail investors covering their shorts and absorbing them. In the afternoon session, the recent demobilization bond was forced to hit the limit down by five thousand lots sold by the forty-eighth lot. The recent nine benevolent was taken advantage of by the twenty-first lot, hitting the limit down with one blow. After this, the selling pressure slightly eased, and the decline gradually stopped. The twentieth Customs Unified Salt Tax still rose by three five six jiao. Later, due to the forty-eighth lot selling gold short again, it continued to fall by over one yuan, and the forward contracts for the first sixth positive were rising by one yuan due to strong buying interest. The market price resulted in a uniform drop of one yuan to four yuan. The total turnover was estimated to be over 30 million yuan. The results of the price increases and falls are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan).</p>

<p>A new foreign firm reported that yesterday (the 17th) the New York stock market saw mixed results. Trading was light, and sellers were very strict in their choices. Near the close, bulls rose to maintain prices, and giant stocks all rose. However, people's opinions were very inconsistent, and speculators were also quite cautious. Silver stocks also fell due to the large declines. Airline stocks rose, transportation stocks were stable, utility stocks trended higher, railroad stocks rose due to increased freight, and oil stocks had been very strong recently, but were quite calm yesterday. Stocks and bonds on the small exchange were uneven. The total turnover for the day was 2.35 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>The yarn market is quite strong, and the situation is good. The overseas cotton industry situation is stable, and people's hearts are more supportive. Moreover, the securities market has been deteriorating step by step recently. According to the market, there is a saying that interest rates may be reduced. The general oversensitive people have even more hope for further price increases. People's morale is particularly high, and the market has slowly risen.</p>
<p>Yuan Yi Yong Chang buys in. At the pre-market opening of the standard yarn market, each month rose consistently. Because US cotton three-ply yarns were all calm, and yesterday was the last day of business for the flower and yarn market, gatherings will be suspended from tomorrow until the 28th of this month, when regular auctions will resume. In order to avoid risks, most cautious people want to hedge straight over, and the market price is extremely stable. As a result, each month rose by seven jiao to one yuan and two jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market situation at the opening in the afternoon was still calm. After the second session, people's morale turned tight, saying that the rumors of public debt interest rate reductions were very prevalent. The buying interest suddenly became strong. Yuan Yi Yong Chang came again with a large amount of purchases, and the market continued to rise. As a result, each month rose by four, five, eight, and nine jiao to one yuan compared to the morning closing price. Check the sales of Jin Chang 650 bales, He Xing 400 bales, Tai Chang 300 bales, Da Fu 350 bales, Tong Fu 550 bales, Yuan Da 2150 bales, Geng Feng 1250 bales, Sen Kang 450 bales, Tai Chang 500 bales, Tong He 500 bales, buy quasi-Da Feng 900 bales, Ren Feng 500 bales, Tai Chang 500 bales, Xin Yi 900 bales, Yuan Yi 1600 bales, Qian 350 bales, Da Chang 400 bales, Yong Chang 2250 bales, the highest and lowest prices and closing prices in one day are listed below.</p>

<p>The cotton market is very good, US cotton has rebounded, Indian cotton is peaceful, and the standard gold market is stable. People's hearts are becoming more and more supportive. There is a lack of sellers in the market. Banks have tightened up a large number of chips, and they have not released them from beginning to end. However, the American bulls have already let go.</p>
<p>The standard flower market closed higher for hedging. At the pre-market opening of the standard flower market, US cotton was lacking sellers, rising 5 to 15 pounds. Japanese merchants and European exporters bought back and strengthened Indian cotton, rising 0.25 to 0.75 rupees. At the same time, the standard gold market price was good, and the selling atmosphere was tight. As a result, each month rose by five fen to two jiao and a half. Buying activity suddenly picked up at the opening in the afternoon. Because the news was favorable to the bulls, short-sellers were active in hedging, and the market rose sharply. As a result, each month rose by five fen to one jiao and a half to two jiao compared to the morning closing price. Check the sales of Heng Yi 1,000 dan, Geng Yi 2,400 dan, Shen Ji 1,800 dan, Qian 1,200 dan, Yuan Yi 1,200 dan, Qian Yi 1,100 dan, Da Yi 1,000 dan, Da Yi 1,000 dan, Chang He 4,100 dan, Yu Da 2,600 dan.

<p>—Japanese Merchants and Others Buy Indian Cotton, Also Rising—</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the opening of US cotton, each month rose or fell by one to four points. Brokers, brokers, New Orleans and foreign merchants all bought in, but the turnover was not high. New cotton sellers were not as enthusiastic as old cotton sellers, so the status of new cotton was more firm. It is reported that Washington has the intention of adopting a soil conservation plan to replace the agricultural integration plan. The delivery notices for the January period suddenly stopped, and there were not many new accounts. A small amount of buying was affected. Licensed cotton inventory increased by about 2,000 bales, so the position in the January period was relatively calm. Hester estimated that the consumption this week was 291,000 bales, and the inventory in Liverpool was 400,000 bales. During the closing, due to short positions hedging, it was still firm. Spot prices rose by 5 points, and futures prices rose by 7 to 15 points. The spot price of British cotton fell by 2 points, and futures prices rose by 12 points. Japanese merchants and European exporters bought Indian cotton, and there were few sellers. The price of Ping Guo Er rose by 0.25 rupees, the price of Omura rose by 1 to 1.5 rupees, and Bai Luo Xi was unchanged. The original telegram is listed on the left (telegram on the 17th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for Bai Luo Xi Hua on the 18th was 207 rupees, an increase of 1.5 rupees compared to the previous day's closing.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign Xiang rice was completely stagnant. The total inventory of rice in Shanghai was more than 800,000 bags, with Xiang rice (including the seven provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, Anhui, Hubei, Fujian, Guangdong, and East Zhejiang) and Jiangzhe Dumai accounting for the majority. Foreign rice stocks accounted for less than one-tenth of the total. Among the 300,000 bags stored in warehouses along the Suzhou River, Jiangzhe rice accounted for eight or nine tenths, and Wan rice and Jiangbei Nanjing and other Xiang rice only one or two tenths. The stocks in Hexia Hucun and merchants belonged to Dumai.</p>

<p>—The Wheat Futures Market Saw Short Covering and Customer Speculation—</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was short covering and customer speculation in wheat futures, and the market rose steadily. In particular, the lack of spot goods meant that short sellers were scrambling to cover their positions in this month's contracts. Forward contracts were considered unfavorable to foreign merchants, and speculation was intense, with prices rising by 3 to 5 points at the close. The total wheat inventory was 27,000 bags, mainly composed of Yangtze River wheat, with other varieties only accounting for a small portion.</p>
<p>Overseas purchases of wheat and flour continued to be limited to immediate needs, which was disappointing. The snowfall was beneficial to winter wheat, and Canadian wheat exports saw a slight improvement.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were only a dozen sources of supply (with a total of over 3,000 shi of goods). On the sales side, due to the approaching end of the year, stores slightly increased their reserves. However, there was no large-scale demand, and contract sales continued to amount to over 4,000 bags, with both thick japonica and thin indica varieties. The market situation saw mixed results. The price of Suzhou Tong japonica increased by 1 jiao, the price of Nanyang early indica was stable, and the price of thin indica increased by 5 to 7 fen. Duyang tip and Yinbian Yuan saw no progress.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) In the previous few days, due to the approaching end of the lunar year, the supply from the interior was weak, causing market prices to decline daily. Yesterday, the number of boats arriving at Hexia was sparse, only a dozen or so. Various firms prepared to close, causing the turnover of white japonica stores to slightly increase. Speculators were actively increasing their reserves, causing market prices to rebound by about 2 jiao. Early indica followed closely with 1 jiao, and thin indica saw a slight increase in price. Tianjin stocks continued to move, with prices rising by 1 or 2 jiao. White yuan tightened by an additional jiao, but there was a lack of transactions in customer tips. The prices of other goods also tightened by a few fen to 1 jiao.</p>

<p>London is the main market for black tea trade. The prosperity or decline of the tea market there is of great importance to the world tea industry. Last year, due to the influx of tea from India, Ceylon, and Taiwan, the market was overstocked, and market prices plummeted. From east to east, tea in Fudge State plummeted by 16 shillings and eight pence per hundred pounds. The price of black tea in Taiwan and Qimen and Fudge Zhuzhou in our country also fell by about 10 shillings. English and Dutch tea merchants all believe that there is no way to reverse the decline without restricting production again.</p>

<p>The price of Quanzhou dried longan, which had previously been loose due to weak sales, has become tight again due to the few arrivals. It has been found that in previous years, the market trend would inevitably decline before the end of the year. However, this year it is the opposite, which is actually due to the thin stock and the recent increase in demand from Zhejiang. Yesterday, according to sources, the Hua Ping wheel will arrive today or tomorrow, and the supply is said to be only a hundred or so items, so the market situation is even more firm.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Piece Goods: Woolen Cloths of the Past Year <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The year of 24 has passed in the blink of an eye. The changes in the woolen cloth market situation during this year are also quite considerable. Now I will briefly describe the entire process for the reference of both insiders and outsiders.</p>
<p>January: Because it was close to the end of the old lunar year and the settlement period, both overt and covert funds were tight. It was extremely difficult to recover debts, which were greatly discounted compared to the year 23. Customer accounts in Nanjing and Hankou were even worse, and many orders from foreign clothing stores were returned. Woolen cloths also successively saw a decline in orders. Only "Ren" character woolen cloth was almost completely snapped up and saw a unique surge in price. 1005's eighteen and twenty-four colored riding breeches cloth also sold well and increased in price. Overcoat cloth suffered the most losses because the weather was mild, unlike a typical winter, and sales were sluggish, resulting in a large amount of inventory being left unsold.</p>
<p>February: The opening price of the red market was very flat. Most were cheaper than the closing price of the previous month. Only the "Jue" character "Ren" character woolen cloth and twilled bunting remained firm and expensive, while everything else declined. The Yuanbao business in this street was smoother than in previous years because the opening price of the red market was flat and standardized, avoiding the bad habit of haggling. Most of the direct tribute cloths and plain serges had already been defeated by Japanese goods. Although the price of Western plain serge was cheap, it was still not easy to sell.</p>
<p>March: This month, the woolen cloth trade was very prosperous. Stores, foreign clothing tailors, hat workshops, etc. in this street, as well as large and small customers from Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Hankou, Nanchang, Changsha, Guiyang, and the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, all made large purchases. Only the Sichuan customers' purchasing power remained sluggish, but the Sichuan customers also made some minor purchases. Plain serge, Yuan direct tribute, plain Walter, flannel suit cloth, Zhong-something-Hai Ling Peng, patterned foreign cloth, bunting, etc., all sold very well. Single-sided "open water" rice market sales were also active. Unfortunately, the credit price was even weaker than in February. The reason for this was still the sluggish market, tight funds, and long turnover periods for earlier orders. Different purchasing costs led to competition and chaos.</p>
<p>April: Cloth prices fell eight or nine out of ten times. No one in the industry hoped for an increase. Most only hoped to maintain stability, which would be considered fortunate. Although summer goods needed for summer sales were gradually appearing on the market, the market situation was still extremely bad. Recovering loans was quite difficult. Returned orders from Western clothing stores flooded the market. Bankruptcies and closures continued in both local and out-of-town areas. The tightness of funds and the difficulty of doing business reached their peak at this point.</p>
<p>May: Although sales of various woolen cloths were very strong, prices frequently fell. The main reason was still tight funds and an abundance of goods. The collapse of Ming-something, Mei-something, and both Chinese and foreign banks made businesses even more uneasy. New goods arrived cheaply, while old goods had high purchasing costs. Prices were chaotic due to the lack of a transition period. The price of Palais-something faltered particularly heavily. Rongtai Standard's old brand 15330 Constitutional Picture Durable Cloth also suddenly became chaotic because of a warehouse fire, which led to auction sales.</p>
<p>June: The weather was hot, and white goods for summer were all selling well in a timely manner. Striped white-somethings, patterned striped white direct yellow Palais-somethings, etc., sold particularly well. Yellow twill gauze, diagonal cloth, linen cloth, bunting cloth, beaded gauze, etc., also had smooth sales, but the price still fell. Only Japanese lower-grade white-somethings and thirty-six-inch.</p>
<p>July: Transactions were still good before the middle ten days of the month. Gray and white colors of yarn and wool-woven goods sold well. Transactions suddenly declined after the middle ten days of the month. Many in the industry sunned goods and took a summer break. This was a customary practice during the slack season over the years.</p>
<p>August: Autumn and winter woolen cloths of various kinds mostly opened for sale one after another. The prices quoted were all more favorable than the spring offerings in February. This was all due to the prevailing situation and environment, and not just a local phenomenon. Sichuan customers were the first to make purchases. Japanese woolen cloths were selling briskly, both in terms of arrivals and sales. British and German goods were severely impacted and had already occupied an important position. Following Rongtai, another well-known old business, Taihe, established a woolen cloth department.</p>
<p>September: The woolen cloth market showed great progress. Stores in this street all had a large volume of transactions. Foreign firms were shipping goods very busily. Postal parcel deliveries increased greatly. Unfortunately, prices continued to fall. Direct tribute cloth and riding breeches cloth were very favorable. Yarn plain thick cloth and Polish trading firms sold a lot of goods on the spot. Sellers generally held the principle of preferring to cut prices rather than extend credit.</p>
<p>October: Various woolen cloths sold well in a timely manner to domestic customers. Various men's and women's colored Western suit goods had large transactions every day. However, compared with previous years, sales decreased significantly because prices had fallen. From the 25th, woolen and quilted cloth prices saw a sudden contraction of prior orders, and customs duties and gold premiums soared, pushing up costs. As a result, many clamored for price increases. However, apart from overcoat cloth and yellow plain thick cloth, much of this was just a show of force. Silky bunting and horsehair satin also saw real sharp increases due to the soaring cost of rayon and yarn and wool raw materials. Eastern goods like thin floral cloth, medium-thick serge, and Polish overcoat cloth and yellow plain thick cloth showed better trends. Western goods like Halifax and high-striped floral cloth were particularly popular, with great demand from clothing tailors. Embroidered floral cloth with words on the selvage was fashionable for a time.</p>
<p>November: Cloth prices saw great changes. The government implemented the legal tender on the 4th, and people's minds were shaken. Woolen fabrics continued to rise in price. Sellers were unwilling to sell at prices lower than their original cost, while buyers bought only as needed. Polish goods saw the greatest increase. Japanese goods also saw sharp increases due to currency exchange rates. Domestic goods also reported price increases due to the high cost of raw materials. Transactions were limited because everyone needed legal tender, and sellers did not allow flexibility with checks (due to too many returned checks). As a result, there were only retail sales and few wholesale transactions. At the end of the month, the weather suddenly turned cold, and actual sales increased greatly. Plain thick cloth, medium-thick serge, riding breeches cloth, double-sided yellow camel down, "Ren" character woolen cloth, etc., continued to trade briskly (to be continued).</p>

<p>— Zhou Qingyan, Wujin County Dujiao Elementary School</p>
<p>I am a poor elementary school student. My home is near a towering factory (a weaving mill). My father works in this factory, and our family's livelihood depends entirely on him.</p>
<p>My father has a strong physique, bronze-colored skin, and large arms. Every day, before the east turns white, he gets up and rushes to the factory to start his day's work.</p>
<p>That factory is extremely large, with more than three thousand male and female workers. I have also visited every workshop. Dozens of machines are neatly arranged, moving in the same way: belts spinning rapidly, axles turning decisively, the sound of the machines rumbling, as if playing a great melody, making me feel relaxed and happy. My father said, "People who eat by their own labor are truly the noblest and most honorable people in the world. After you graduate next year, I will something you into the factory to work, because I believe that in the future world, those who do not work will not eat!" Hearing these words, I felt infinitely comfortable and honored, and I suddenly developed unlimited interest in "labor," "power," and "career." At the same time, the lighthouse for my future career direction has already revealed some faint rays of light.</p>
<p>Now, I am in the sixth grade, the last period of my schooling. Because after graduation, I will go to live in that active and lively world, and those capable arms will be used from then on. However, judging from my physique, current environment, and everything else, I can never become an ordinary worker. I must work hard. Because in this 20th century, inventors are not university students or overseas students, but workers. Edison was a newspaper boy when he was young, and Franklin was a printing worker in his childhood, but through various efforts, he eventually became a great inventor, benefiting mankind. I must work hard, I am determined to work hard! I vow to work hard! I will study the principles of machinery thoroughly and hope to become a great engineer.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Game Method to Enhance Children's Observation Skills <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>Now I will talk about a game method that is very beneficial and interesting for children. It can be tried anywhere, whether on a long train journey, in a quiet sit-down stroll by the seaside and in the forest, or in boredom while sitting at home on a rainy day. As long as there are three or five children, they can use this method to benefit the children and make them happy without feeling bored. This method is very simple. Just take some miscellaneous objects at hand, put them in front of the children, and tell them to pay attention and look at them. Then, immediately cover the objects with a large cloth or square scarf and ask each child to write down the names of the objects they can remember. Naturally, whoever writes the most correctly wins. This method can train children's memory. Because memory improves with training. At the same time, it can also enhance their observation skills, enabling them to pay attention to everything they see at any time. When we take children for a walk on the streets of the city, we can also play this game. For example, when passing a fruit store, you can ask the children to turn around and report the names of the various fruits they saw after a glance. If it is a grocery store, then you can ask him to report the various items displayed in the glass window. If you are strolling in the park, you can ask him to report what flowers, trees, birds, and houses he saw in the place he walked through a few minutes ago. In more detail, you can ask him to describe the shape, color, and type of each object separately. This method can be gradually extended to various scenes and various experiences in life.</p>
<p>Some schools are now using this method to improve students' memory and cultivate students' observation skills, and have achieved good results.</p>
<p>In the book "The Technique of Thinking" by Nietz, there is a quote from the son of the famous painter Carini, who said: "My father often took me for a walk in the countryside. When we encountered a beautiful scene, we would stop and observe it quietly for a few minutes. Then we would both turn around and try to recall the characteristics of the beautiful scene that were imprinted in our minds during that moment of observation." He also said: "My father's observation and memory are very strong. He often remembers the points that ordinary people cannot observe even after a few months, without any errors." This characteristic is not innate, nor can it be obtained in one day. It all depends on practicing observation skills in peacetime. Over time, it becomes a habit. All the beautiful natural landscapes and the various interesting points around us can be deeply imprinted in our minds after seeing them. As a result, experience can become richer day by day, and studies can be easily successful. Conversely, if there is a lack of such practice, the various things seen are like clouds passing before the eyes, and cannot be imprinted in the mind at all. Because things seen by chance are most easily overlooked and something. The so-called "absent-mindedness, seeing but not seeing, hearing but not something." Many scholars in the world have become famous by using their daily experience in observing things. Therefore, we should train children's memory and observation skills from an early age.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Newsboy Club <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zhanjin</p>
<p>Recently, the Hong Kong authorities organized a "Newsboy Club Preparatory Committee." The address has also been determined, and the funds are raised from all walks of life. It is expected to be formally established before the end of the lunar year. In addition to installing various sports and recreational equipment in the club, an free night school will also be run, completely free of charge to enroll newsboys to study; something afterwards can also.</p>
<p>Children! It can be said that the achievements of China's Children's Year are not much, but at the end of Children's Year, there is this good news. (But it was also initiated by foreigners.) Of course, we have to be happy for a while. So what is regrettable is that foreigners do practical work first, but the people of our own country lag behind! And there are also thousands of newsboys in Shanghai, wandering newsboys; they are blown by the wind and beaten by the rain; they are also the people of China, why are they so unfortunate?</p>
<p>So now I hear that some good people will also launch this kind of organization, and they also want to raise funds from all walks of life. I hope very much here that when fundraising begins in the future, children will do their best to persuade their fathers and relatives, then the newsboys will be very grateful.</p>

<p>Isn't the weather these days very cold? Ah! Children! Do you have a stove at home? Alas! Don't you often see in the newspaper every year that a family has been poisoned by gas? Do you know why they died? I'm afraid you may not be able to answer! This is because of the lack of knowledge about gas. Now, I'll take this opportunity to talk to everyone about it.</p>
<p>The main cause of death is mostly because the stove does not have a pipe, and the gas has no way to escape. As a result, the gas combines with oxygen to become carbon dioxide. Also, because the oxygen in the room is limited, and the air exhaled by people is also dead air, the continued production of gas does not have oxygen to combine with, and the room is filled with carbon monoxide, but its nature is poisonous, and it has solidified. Blood loses its blood characteristics and its instinct, and naturally will not circulate, and people will die.</p>
<p>Children! If you encounter a poisoned person, you should drag the poisoned person to an open space, and then use artificial respiration to revive him. This is also a meritorious thing. Also, the room where the stove is burning must feel very dry. Then, you only need to put a pot of water on the stove, and the pot will have water vapor, which will be released continuously to regulate the humidity, which is very hygienic. Finally, I hope that the children can explain the knowledge about gas to their neighbors, so that they all know the horror of gas poisoning and the methods of rescue.</p>

<p>Dear children:</p>
<p>At this time when the country is in trouble, I know that you will definitely work harder to study, and I also know that you may be writing a diary every day. Now I want to talk to you about the benefits and methods of writing a diary.</p>

<p>What should I record in my diary? Many children always say when writing a diary, what should I record? Dear children! Do you have this feeling that there is nothing to write about? In fact, diary material is everywhere. Like: what you see, what you hear, what you do, what you think. Just choose and add a suitable topic to the paragraph. Isn't it a good diary?</p>
<p>How should I write a diary? I think: 1. Write diligently, do not interrupt. 2. Write real things, do not create out of thin air. 3. Write carefully, do not perfunctorily.</p>
<p>Finally, I will introduce some excellent diaries: Yihua's Diary, Anniversary Diary... Reading them will definitely help your writing. Let's talk next time: I wish you progress.</p>

<p>One day, Ah Xi came back from school and said to his mother:</p>
<p>"Mom? I got first place on the natural science exam":</p>
<p>Mom asked happily:</p>
<p>"Ah Xi! Really? What question did the teacher ask you? Tell me quickly":</p>
<p>Ah Xi said:</p>
<p>"The question the teacher asked me was how many legs does an ostrich have, and I said it has three legs."</p>
<p>Mom said:</p>
<p>"No, an ostrich has two legs, how could you get first place?"</p>
<p>Ah Xi said: "No, I'm not lying. There are ten people in our class, and nine of them said that an ostrich has four legs. The teacher said I was closer, so I got first place!"</p>

<p>He looked at Bo Deshi and stopped in surprise. He moved aside, knelt down in the viewing grass and reeds by the ditch, with a look of pity in his eyes, focused on Bo Deshi's body.</p>
<p>With him was a yellow-haired, black-eyed child with cheeks like roses, who had not been born for a few years. He ran busily in the chest-high dwarf trees, talking. After a while, he stopped and carefully looked at the poor big dog lying still.</p>
<p>This was their first meeting! Little Nanluo and Bo Deshi.</p>
<p>The result of this day was that Old Dashifei spent a lot of effort to drag the poor dog to his own small house area and carefully took care of it. It didn't have any serious injuries, just because it was thirsty, tired, and exposed to the summer heat, its head was dizzy, and it really couldn't bear it. Now, after resting in a cool place, it regained its original strength and health. It finally stood up on its four powerful legs.</p>
<p>In the first few weeks, it felt weak and helpless, close to death; but it didn't hear a harsh word all day, and no whips or sticks touched its body. All it heard was the child's pitying soft voice, and all it felt was the old man's comforting stroking.</p>
<p>During its illness, this lonely old man and that happy child were its most sincere caregivers.</p>
<p>It occupied a corner in this small house, with a pile of hay for its something bed; they always listened to its breathing sound very earnestly in the dark, knowing that it was still alive; when it regained some strength and was able to make a discontinuous bark, they laughed happily, even to the point of crying with joy, because they knew it had recovered; Little Nanluo was happy as if something. He picked many small chrysanthemums and made a wreath to put around its neck and kissed its bright red lips.</p>
<p>So Bo Deshi became lively again, still strong and powerful as before; in its pair of hot big eyes, there was a very surprised look, how come no one beat it or scolded it now; it felt a great love in its heart, which it had never had before.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Children's Science Lecture: Currency <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Linyin</p>
<p>After Shennong established the method of "trading at noon", there were times and places for transactions in society. However, at that time, the people still had a problem. They felt that it was inconvenient to exchange goods for goods, and the prices of goods were high and low, so some suffered losses and some got bargains in the exchange. Therefore, Shennong also thought of a kind of intermediate product of trade to replace the value of goods. At that time, shells and leather (Figure 1) were used, which is the origin of currency.</p>
<p>Later, everyone felt that shells and leather were inconvenient, so they came up with the idea of using metal to cast currency. This was the evolution of currency. Some were knife-shaped, some were square with round holes in the middle, and some looked like bells. (Figure 2) From the time of the Yellow Emperor, it was used until the Han Dynasty.</p>
<p>After many improvements, the value of the currency itself was used to determine the price represented by the currency, such as small coins cast from copper, small change cast from silver, and silver dollars, which were of high value. (Figure 3) And the use value of various currencies is specified. My country uses silver dollars as the main body, called the silver standard, like the United Kingdom uses gold pounds as the main body, called the gold standard.</p>
<p>However, metal currency also has a disadvantage. Its weight is too heavy and it is inconvenient to carry. If the amount of money going in and out is large, it takes a lot of time to count. Therefore, paper money was invented later, commonly known as banknotes. (Figure 3) This kind of money is light and easy to collect, and it is the most convenient type of currency.</p>
<p>Now, in order to unify the monetary system and relieve finance, the government has stipulated that the paper money of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications is legal currency. That is to say, the banknotes of these three banks are currencies recognized and used by the country, and the use of silver dollars has been prohibited. And the exchange of unified currency is that each small silver dollar is worth 250 copper coins, and one yuan of legal currency can be exchanged for 12 small silver dollars, or 3,000 copper coins. In this way, the use of currency something is more something.</p>

<h3 id="e194">The Genesis and Function of Buddhism <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Jingzai</p>
<p>Buddhism is a kind of religious thought that opposed Brahmanism, but it is not entirely unrelated to Brahmanism. Furthermore, we must observe it from the perspective of the changes in Indian social group relations to understand its genesis and the function of its doctrines. Around 1000 BC, it was the era of the Aryan conquest of India. The great Indian epics, the Mahabharata with its 100,000 verses and the Ramayana with its 24,000 verses, record the historical events of this period of war. Mr. Lü in his "Brief History of Indian Buddhism" said that at the beginning of the Aryan conquest of India, a naturalistic religion that worshipped natural objects emerged, and the Brahmins were the priests who created Brahmanism. The Brahmins also "sang praises of the grandeur of celestial phenomena and earthly instruments with utmost detail. The spirits they worshipped initially took the forms of natural objects but gradually came to believe that they possessed moral qualities, capable of bestowing rewards and punishments. At the same time, they cultivated philosophical thought." Thus, Brahmanism truly originated from primitive natural fetishism, and the source of the so-called four Vedas’ doctrines also stemmed from this. However, after the Aryan people conquered the indigenous people of India, they themselves became the ruling aristocracy, so the religion they believed in gradually became the religion of the ruling class. Furthermore, due to their position of dominance and widespread development, the priests who believed and performed sacrifices naturally became a special class, transforming into the highest rulers. However, precisely because the Aryans and Brahmin priests became the rulers, they no longer needed to engage in outward warfare and killing as they did when they first invaded India. They only sought to maintain their rule and current status, and even only pursued a life of comfort and spiritual salvation and liberation. Therefore, Brahmanism gradually changed its religious thought, transforming its religious doctrines from natural fetishism to research that "became increasingly lofty and profound," "combining the nature of philosophy and religion," thinking to "exhaust the mysteries of the universe and escape the realm of birth and death," "establishing profound theories." Some leaned toward contemplative thought, while others were earnest in the path of liberation and became hermits.</p>
<p>However, since the Aryan people ruled India as foreigners and became the highest ruling aristocracy, and the priests who believed in their religion also became the highest rulers, the indigenous aristocrats of India inevitably became the ruled, occupying an inferior position. The Indian society at that time was divided into four classes. The Aryan aristocrats and Brahmin priests naturally occupied the highest ruling position and were satisfied with the status quo. However, the indigenous people of India, from aristocrats to slaves, and even the lower strata of Aryan and Brahmin society, were all dissatisfied with the status quo and opposed it. A complex essence of group struggle naturally existed here, and anti-Brahmanism thus became a widespread ideology. The rise of Buddhist doctrines represented this anti-Brahmanism trend. This movement was participated in, and even led by, the ruled aristocracy. Therefore, Shakyamuni was born into the Shakya clan, a non-Aryan group in India, and his position was that of a king's prince within that clan. This proves that some aristocrats were often resisters against the rulers. However, at that time, the social economy of India was based on a slave society. On the one hand, the resistance of the slave groups themselves could not embark on a path of organized resistance activities. On the other hand, even under the leadership of the aristocracy, they could not trust them to rise up and engage in practical resistance, so as to shake their own position. Therefore, that kind of passive resistance only in consciousness was most suited to their needs, and the doctrines of Buddhism took this kind of intention as their central thought.</p>
<p>Once we understand the group relations and group psychology of India at the time of the rise of Buddhism, the reasons for the rise of the Buddhist movement will naturally be clear. At the same time, we can also understand the true meaning and function of its doctrines. Buddhist doctrine recognizes that everything is impermanent, and the real world is suffering.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>The reason why the real world is suffering is because of impermanence, because impermanence means constant change, and constant change means suffering. In terms of human life, birth, aging, sickness, and death are changes, so it considers birth, aging, sickness, and death as suffering. Transcending birth, aging, sickness, and death is the liberation from suffering, that is, transcending change and being able to not experience any change is liberation. This kind of thought that is hostile to change, that considers change as suffering, is honestly the fear and lament of the aristocracy themselves. Because they are attached to their old positions, they realize that they were once rulers, but now they are oppressed, so they are very sad about the deterioration of their positions and want to obtain something constant and unchanging. Naturally, they will be hostile to this change and impermanence, and consider it as suffering. In their view, change is emptiness, because something that exists becomes nothing when it changes. Their original superiority becomes non-superior, and everything in the past is lost in the midst of change, so their philosophy recognizes that changing things are illusion and emptiness. All the myriad things in reality are changing, so all things are empty. The Four Great Elements are empty is their ultimate epistemological philosophy. They use this to deny the material world, and consider everything that is fragrant, flavorful, tangible, and perceptible to be empty. Although they take everything as emptiness as the basis of their knowledge, they are not satisfied with this emptiness. Emptiness arises from change, so they have to seek something unchanging and eternal to fill their emptiness. Thus, they attribute the external world entirely to consciousness. Things are formed by consciousness, and the changing world is also formed by consciousness. If we want to forget all the changes in the external world, and not be tainted or suffer from the changing external world, then we can only achieve this by not focusing on it, by realizing that the unchanging Suchness. In this way, if we eliminate material desires and attachment to the real world, and sweep away external conditions and worldly knowledge to clarify the mind and see its nature, then we can obtain liberation, which is also their method of escaping suffering. Buddhist practice takes this as its purpose, so its asceticism is otherworldly.</p>
<p>However, the above-mentioned Buddhist doctrines are the highest orthodox doctrines of the Yogacara school of Mahayana Buddhism, while the doctrines of Hinayana remain within the cycle of cause and effect, birth, death, and reincarnation. People with profound Buddhist thought generally despise it. In fact, in our view, although Mahayana Buddhism is the authentic and original Buddhism, it is the doctrine of the aristocrats. Because although they express opposition to the alteration of their old positions, they also oppose continued edification, and take transcending the changing world to reach the Suchness of enlightened minds as liberation. But this is precisely what people who still have food to eat and blessings to enjoy do, and they are even more unwilling to accept the consequences of cause and effect and reincarnation, nor are they willing to die old and sick, because they do not want to suffer the consequences of being an exploiter in the next life, nor do they want their positions to deteriorate again in reincarnation. As for the Hinayana school, it is different. Although its negative otherworldly thought still originates from Buddhism and is subject to the anesthesia and deception of the aristocracy, the aristocrats' doctrines have changed in their hands. Because they hope that by cultivating good causes in this life, they can be reincarnated into the upper class in the next life and obtain good results. Therefore, Mahayana and Hinayana can be said to express different ideals of groups, containing the meaning of group opposition within them.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Introducing "Healthy World" <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Quanqing</p>
<p>Published by Kangjian Shijie She, No. 14, Lane 214, Tongfu Road, this city. The price per issue is five cents, and the annual subscription for twelve issues is fifty cents.</p>
<p>In our several consecutive "magazine years," quite a few magazines have indeed appeared; and, in the midst of these, the number of general comprehensive magazines and special specialized magazines has been increasing. However, among these various magazines, if you want to find a practical, easy-to-understand publication about our health, then I have no other publication to recommend to you that better suits your wishes than the recently published "Healthy World."</p>
<p>In the introductory remarks of "Healthy World," the six major missions of this publication are expressed: Promote the true meaning of health; Research the science of health; Advocate health movements; Introduce health news; Disseminate medical knowledge; Realize a happy life. According to the contents of the first and second issues of this publication, it has indeed implemented many of the above-mentioned major missions. Regarding promoting the true meaning of health and methods of health, the inaugural issue contains Kangjian Qifu's "From the Desire for Survival to Health and National Destiny," Zhinan's "Health Education and Life," Huang Jiping's "Mr. Ge Gongzhen's Pre-Mortem Hygiene Talk," and the second issue contains Yi Mei's "Mr. Li Hefei's Health Talk," Mr. Zhou Yimin's "Several Points to Pay Attention to Regarding Health"... Regarding women's and children's health, the inaugural issue contains Shi Dong's "Health and Women," Letian Qifu's "Children's Healthy Life," Yuan Wen's "Several Practical Key Points on Children's Hygiene," and the second issue contains Chu Yao's "Methods for Producing Excessive Breast Milk." These articles are all very practical, and anyone who reads them can gain many benefits. Regarding physical education, there is Zhi Zhi's "Ten Tennis Aces" (second issue)... etc. However, I think the best part of this publication, the most beneficial part for general readers, is still the "Medical Spring and Autumn" column, and a few more words need to be said about this here.</p>
<p>As Fangbian Jun pointed out in "Respectfully Informing Patients" (inaugural issue) and "Again Informing Patients" (second issue), many medical publications in the country are "speaking true prescriptions but selling fake medicines," are "setting traps" to "deceive patients out of their money," and are of a low-grade advertising nature. These things are not only useless to the general reader, especially patients, but also harmful. The "Medical Spring and Autumn" column of "Healthy World" is absolutely different from this type of medical publication. The articles here do not promote individuals, nor do they advertise medicines that sound good but are actually not very effective. They all study various pathologies scientifically and objectively, explain the prevention and treatment of various diseases, and examine the properties of certain foods related to our health and explain their uses. Moreover, these articles are all highly relevant to our actual lives and are of practical use to us. For example, Dr. Zhang Jianqing's "Milk and Health" in the inaugural issue explains the quality of milk and how to eat it in a very practical way; also, such as Yu Chen's "Colds and Influenza" (inaugural issue), Wu Hongyou's "Chatting about Diphtheria," Zhang Jianqing's "Talking about Contraception," and Gu Baoluo's "Drug-Free Therapy for Neurasthenia" (the above three articles are published in the second issue) are all very scientific and practical things. If our families and ourselves inevitably encounter illnesses, and if we need to eat some tonics to maintain our health, then often browsing such a "Healthy World," especially its "Medical Spring and Autumn" column, is indeed very beneficial, because from this we can obtain a lot of useful medical and health knowledge.</p>
<p>In addition, the articles in "Healthy World" are also very easy to understand; anyone, as long as they are literate, can understand them. In this regard, it can also be said that this publication is different from the completely rigid things that generally only talk about academic theory.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Mr. Yu Qiaqing's Interview Record <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Kans</p>
<p>There is an American called "Shipping King" Dollar, whose ships are said to be all over the world, and commercial ships with Dollar Company flags can be seen on any route. In the eyes of ordinary people, this Mr. Dollar is certainly considered a remarkable figure. However, in a country with developed capital and so easily producing "Kings," becoming a "Shipping King" seems much easier than in China. Although China's shipping industry has nearly a hundred years of history, it still seems to be in its infancy due to various reasons. It is conceivable how difficult it would be to create a "Shipping King" in this immature industry. However, despite the immaturity of China's entire shipping administration, there are still individuals who have achieved success. For example, Mr. Yu Qiaqing is an excellent role model in the shipping industry.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu is from Longshan, Zhenhai. At the age of fifteen, he came to Shanghai from his hometown to pursue a career in commerce, diligently working for fifty-four years. In the twentieth year of the Republic of China, prominent figures in Shanghai held a fiftieth anniversary celebration for him to commemorate this extraordinary person. I have long admired Mr. Yu, but I have not had the opportunity to learn from him. This time, thanks to the introduction of Mr. Xu, the editor of a certain journal, through family connections, I was able to have a pleasant one-hour conversation with this celebrity in the shipping industry.</p>
<p>It was a Monday afternoon when I entered the general manager's office of the Sanbei Company. Mr. Yu was focused on handling his daily affairs. After I handed him my letter of introduction, he courteously invited me to sit down.</p>
<p>He is sixty-nine years old this year, and should be an old man in his twilight years, but looking at his radiant, square-shaped face and bright, piercing eyes, he still seems to be in his prime. His tone of voice has not changed his native accent (Zhenjiang accent) despite living in Shanghai for fifty years, but due to his age, it seems even more aged.</p>
<p>"Mr. Yu, you must be very busy with official matters? If you have time, I would like to ask you to tell me about your past experiences. I believe you have a lot of experiences that can serve as a model for young people." I explained my purpose.</p>
<p>"I'm just doing some routine work every day, so I can't say I'm that busy. But asking me to tell you about my past experiences as a model for young people, I don't think there's any good material worth providing you!"</p>
<p>"Don't be modest, Mr. Yu! I heard that your current position is entirely due to your struggle in difficult circumstances. In this process, there must be a lot of valuable material. It is said that you used to learn business in a paint shop, is that true?"</p>
<p>"Yes." His tone was as firm as cutting nails. Then, he closed one eye and deeply recalled, "That was more than fifty years ago. The paint shop where I was an apprentice was called Ruikang, and it was opened by Mr. Xi Runru. At that time, the scale was very small, with a capital of only eight hundred taels. The shop used only three 'Chaofeng' (shop assistants). Later, when I joined, there were a total of four people. In addition to doing what an ordinary apprentice should do, I also served as a street runner..."</p>
<p>I waited for him to rest for a moment and then asked, "Why were you so interested in the paint industry back then?"</p>
<p>"When I came from my hometown, I originally planned to go to a small money shop in Nanshi Dawang Temple to learn about money matters. However, because another fellow villager, Mr. So-and-so, came with me, and he couldn't wait for long after arriving in Shanghai due to the circumstances at the time, Mr. Yu Jiu, a member of our clan who brought us to Shanghai, introduced him to the small money shop first. I only joined Ruikang Paint Shop later." A pleasant smile spread across his radiant face, and he tightened his hands further into his sleeves.</p>
<p>"It is said that the manager of the shop dreamed of a barefoot God of Wealth the night before you joined Ruikang. The next day, when you joined the shop, it was raining heavily, and coincidentally, you had taken off your shoes and socks. The manager was overjoyed when he saw it. Is this also true?"</p>
<p>"That was also a coincidence," he said, smiling, "But it was indeed raining heavily on the day I joined the shop, and the only pair of new shoes I had just put on my feet. At the time, I really felt sorry for them, so I took them off along with my socks. If transportation in Shanghai were as convenient as it is now, perhaps there wouldn't be such far-fetched stories."</p>
<p>"However, it is said that you earned more than 20,000 taels in the year you joined the shop. I think even if that kind of story is a 'far-fetched statement,' it doesn't seem to be without reason, right?"</p>
<p>"No!" He leaned back in his chair, seeming slightly displeased with my words, and then said, "That kind of legend is just the superstitious thinking of old people. If business makes money, it is attributed to the gods; if it fails, they complain about their fate. In modern commerce, we must never have this kind of thinking. The success or failure of a business has its inherent causes and objective environment, and it is definitely not something that can be achieved by accidental acquisition or seeking the protection of the gods. The year I joined the shop was when the paint business had great potential, but some people didn't see this point. So, after I was assigned to be a street runner shortly after joining the shop, I tried my best to work hard in my duties. Of course! There is no easy theorem that one must cultivate to reap the rewards, so at the end of that year, the result of my hard work was a profit of more than 20,000 taels of silver." He flashed two fingers in the air and then inserted them back into his sleeves.</p>
<p>"In that year, the shop should have given you a great reward for your hard work, right?" I said with a smile.</p>
<p>"You young people always like to think about it from this perspective. However, according to the old rules of the shops at the time, apprentices usually only received twelve yuan for shoes and socks at the end of the year. That year, because I earned more than 20,000 taels, the shop was particularly polite to me and added forty yuan for shoes and socks. This was indeed an unprecedented example in the business community at the time." He shook four fingers at me like a fan, showing a very satisfied look with the situation at the time.</p>
<p>"You probably stayed at Ruikang for several years, right?"</p>
<p>"More than ten years. In the second year there, a paint shop called Santai wanted to hire me as a 'Chaofeng'先生, but Mr. Xi didn't want me to leave, so he voluntarily gave up two shares of Ruikang to me. At the time, I couldn't bear to leave Ruikang myself, so I pooled together two hundred taels of silver to join the shares. From then on, Ruikang's business became more and more prosperous day by day, earning more and more money year by year. At this time, I was both a shareholder and an employee. Every year, I always got a little profit, and I also had a small reputation in society. So, I used the money I earned in society to give back to society. For all social undertakings, as long as my ability and financial resources could reach, I always tried my best to support them."</p>
<p>"When did you give up the paint business?"</p>
<p>"I ran the paint business for twelve years. At that time, I was only twenty-seven years old. Not long after, I accepted the invitation of Roullin &amp; Company to serve as a comprador. I also worked there for nine years before switching to Daosheng Bank. Because of many reasons, I only worked at Daosheng for one year, and then joined the Netherlands Bank as a comprador again. This time was the longest period I served in the financial industry, almost thirty years."</p>
<p>"Mr. Yu, the number of years you've worked is much older than my age! Did you do other businesses during such a long period? When did you start in the shipping industry?"</p>
<p>"Haha!" He pondered for a moment, smiling, "Speaking of this, it's also a matter of decades ago. My motivation for engaging in the shipping industry was also driven by the circumstances at the time. Because in the late Guangxu years, the number of fellow villagers traveling between Shanghai and Ningbo for business increased day by day. At that time, only two ships, Taikoo's 'Beijing' and China Merchants Bureau's 'Jiangtian,' were sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, which was quite in short supply. The unified ticket price was more expensive than other routes, and the general fellow villagers were suffering. Not long after, the French-organized Eastern Company's 'Lida' ship joined the route, wanting to seize the passenger transport of Taikoo and China Merchants. As a result, Taikoo and China Merchants jointly lowered the price to absorb passengers, and the ticket price fell from one yuan to five corners. This situation lasted only one year. The three companies resumed 'reconciliation' and restored the ticket price to the original amount of one yuan, making the general fellow villagers feel the pain of exploitation again. Seeing this situation, I contacted the authorities of the three companies, requesting that the ticket price for the steerage cabin should never exceed five corners, otherwise, the Ningbo people would start their own company and purchase ships to run. However, the result of running back and forth was still not getting the sympathy of the three companies. From this, I deeply felt that foreign capitalists only absorbed profits from China as much as possible, and there was absolutely no trace of morality to speak of. If we want to talk to them, we have to strengthen our own strength first. After this stimulation, I was determined to organize a Ning Shao Company. However, the most important tool for running a shipping company is the wharf. Without a wharf, it is like the foot of a person suffering from hemiplegia, with only the appearance, but in reality, it is of no use at all. However, at that time, the better sections along the Huangpu River were 'snapped up' by foreign companies, and the wharf of the Ning Shao Company became a very important issue. Later, there was no way, so I had to rent the Dongyang Company wharf east of the Waibaidu Bridge from the Japanese, but it was not successful. Then, I rented the wharf south of Waiyangjing Bridge, opposite the French Consulate, from 'Santetang,' but it was also defeated. Finally, I petitioned the Governor-General of Liangjiang in Nanjing and the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce in Beijing, and asked Mr. Zhang Jian from Nantong for help, which solved this important problem. When the Ning Shao Company started business, it first followed the principle of only selling the steerage cabin ticket price for five corners. The general fellow villagers, seeing that it was a self-run shipping industry and the ticket price was low, rushed to take the Ning Shao ships. This aroused the jealousy of the three companies, so they lowered the ticket price from one yuan to two corners, wanting to use the strength of large capital to defeat the Ning Shao Company. However, the unity of us Ningbo people is not bad. When the general fellow villagers saw this situation, everyone was very enthusiastic to help and donated cash to organize a Shipping Industry Maintenance Association. The association sold tickets to the outside world at a uniform price of three corners, and the association subsidized the company for the insufficient amount, which cost tens of thousands of yuan. From then on, the unity of the Chinese nation was noticed by foreigners."</p>
<p>"Sanbei Company was established after the Ning Shao Company, right?"</p>
<p>"No!" He looked at the clock on the wall and then said, "First there was Sanbei, then there was Ning Shao. The reason for running the Sanbei Company was to facilitate the transportation of Longshan. Also, because Longshan is located in the northern township of Zhenhai, Cixi, and Yuyao, there is the name of this Sanbei Company. Initially, there were only three ships sailing, Zhenbei, Cibei, and Yaobei; Cibei Yaobei traveled to Chuanshan, Zhoushan, and Shenjiamen, while Zhenbei sailed on the Yongjiang River and connected to the Shanghai-Ningbo line. At that time, the scale of Sanbei Company was very small, with a capital of only 200,000 yuan, and all the equipment was very simple. However, because Longshan produced a lot of cotton and beans, the cargo transportation was very considerable. In the early years of the Republic of China, the British-owned Hongan Shipping Company was taken over. At this time, I had the idea of recovering navigation rights. Hongan has two ships, 'Changan' and 'Dexing,' and wharves and warehouses in Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, and Hankou. After I took over, because there were still many British shareholders, doing things was inevitably restricted by them, so in the fourth year of the Republic of China, I raised one million capital to buy out the equity of the British and changed the company name to Hongan Commercial Shipping Company. At one time, the two ships 'Changan' and 'Dexing' and the wharves and warehouses in various places were replaced with the flags of Chinese merchant ships. At the same time, Sanbei Company also added branches in various ports. From then on, I personally became a strong enemy of Jardine Matheson and Taikoo in shipping.</p>
<p>"In the seventh year of the Republic of China, the capital of Sanbei Company was increased by 3 million yuan, and two new 3,000-ton ocean-going ships were added to sail on the North and South Ocean routes. Because at this time, the navigation rights of the coastal ports were still in the hands of foreigners, if we don't find a way to resist, in the future, even the territorial waters will be given away together. Sanbei Company was originally a very small company, but after my personal and many colleagues' continuous efforts, the nerves of a group of foreign shipping companies who were 'ignorant of their own limitations' had to be shaken, and they no longer dared to treat Sanbei Company as carelessly as before. Now Sanbei has a total of 29 ships. Today, when the inland navigation rights have been cancelled, it is the time when our country's shipping industry should work hard!"</p>
<p>"Mr. Yu can be considered a 'Shipping King' in China's shipping industry!"</p>
<p>"I don't dare to be complacent," he waved his hands at me repeatedly. "But we still have to try our best to expand the established business, which is what an entrepreneur should do."</p>
<p>"Yes, your views are precisely the proverbs that young students should admire. Mr. Yu, is your personal life still the same as before?" I felt that there were too many things to ask about his past career, so I turned the question to his personal life here.</p>
<p>"The current lifestyle has not changed much from the past. Every day I leave home at 9:00 am and go to a few places I should go to first. At about 11:00 am, I come to Sanbei Company to work. I like to ask about everything in the company, no matter how big or small, but therefore, some people who don't understand me think I am a 'dictator.' In fact, this is just a habit that has been developed over decades of hard work in social undertakings. For example, when things are busy, I even have to eat lunch outside casually to finish things. I work in the afternoon until 8:00 pm before I can go back. If there are social events, I have no way of knowing what time I can go back."</p>
<p>"Then you can simply be said to be living for society. I heard that you are still very frugal even now. Sometimes when you come to the company, you are reluctant to take the elevator. Isn't that a bit too harsh!"</p>
<p>"I don't think it's too harsh. Sometimes walking more is also very comfortable. Fortunately, my feet are still healthy, and I don't feel tired even walking from the bottom to the third floor. In the eyes of modern young people, this kind of life is bound to be considered too frugal, but I am from the heart and it has no effect. When I went back at that time, if I happened to not have a car, I would spend a dozen coppers to take a rickshaw. I never wanted to ask my servants to prepare it for me, because the price of the car they called was always several coppers more expensive than the one I called myself."</p>
<p>"Looking at it this way, Mr. Yu is simply an economist....”</p>
<p>"I'm not an economist, but not wasting money is also my belief..."</p>

<p>— Xiaotian</p>
<p>Speaking of automobile kings, people will mention Ford, but in fact, André Citroën was also once called the automobile king along with Ford. Ten years ago, in 1925, Citroën's car achieved the record for the highest speed, making the progress of French automobile manufacturing technology known to the world. At that time, in Paris, in France, congratulations and praises for Citroën could be seen almost everywhere, and conversations about him could be heard everywhere! At the same time, he, who was called the King of Paris, was of course very happy, dreaming that every citizen of Paris would buy a Citroën car from him.</p>
<p>The Citroën car appeared during the Great War. Compared with the original Loro car, it was the lightest, most fashionable, and most popular at that time, so after the end of the Great War, Citroën's wealth was calculated in millions. In many places, he set up many new factories. He did not hesitate to spend tens of millions of gold on advertising expenses to compete in business. His momentum was so great at the time that it can be said to have alarmed all of Europe. His dominant power was not only manifested in the European market, but also extended to Asia and Africa. The so-called Citroën car can be said to have galloped around the world.</p>
<p>Citroën was born in 1878, his parents</p>
<p>Continued on page 5</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>His name was still little known, but with the development of the Great War, his business became increasingly prosperous. The name of the so-called genius of the economic world, the King of Paris, was also spread everywhere.</p>
<p>He was originally an engineer. After returning from a trip to the United States in 1912, he worked hard to improve and expand his factory, so that he could produce hundreds of cars per month. The Great War continued to develop, and the sound of artillery fire was heard all over the world, which gave him an opportunity to make a fortune. In fact, in the four years of the Great War, his business had developed amazingly. By 1919, his unique cars could be seen everywhere. In 1925, his reputation was comparable to that of automobile king Ford.</p>
<p>In today's world, there will naturally be opportunities for sudden wealth, but it is also very easy to　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Opportunity made a fortune and became an automobile king, but in the recent economic panic, in the ruthless business competition of capitalism, his business also suffered the fate of decline, collapse, and bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, on a tall advertising tower in the Paris night sky, the words Citroen lit up with electric lights, which became one of the gorgeous night scenes of Paris and was known to all Parisians. But now? The bright electric words in the night sky are only in people's memories. The newspaper published the news of the collapse of Citroën Company. The factory of the so-called automobile king Citroën has been managed by his creditors, and the famous he has finally become bankrupt and died!</p>
<p>Even so, Citroën's contribution to society is still great, and his spirit of struggle in his career is still worth emulating.</p>

<p>— Ka</p>
<p>The shadow of my hometown has long been faded in my dreams. For this declining year, the heart of a wanderer is inexplicably troubled again. Indeed, years of wandering have made me feel the fatigue of traveling. So, I also miss my home in my consciousness.</p>
<p>As the iron wheels rumbled forward on the tracks, I sat silently among the countless passengers in the carriage.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of the city completely fell behind the train. The sparse branches outside the window rushed backward. The sunlight was vaguely sprinkled on the gray-brown soil. The train passed through the forest, and a flock of chirping sparrows was startled in the tranquil jungle.</p>
<p>How much I miss these familiar and unfamiliar scenes!</p>
<p>There is no shortage of lively conversations in the car, talking about the decline of the market, which stores in Shanghai have closed down, and also talking about a Miss So-and-so's swimming to save the country.</p>
<p>After getting off the train, I still have to take a two-mao small ferry and a four-mao rickshaw to get home. Because it is closer to my hometown, there are a few familiar villagers on the small ferry. They still mention that the new small steamboat has sailed in Louzhen, which I used to see four years ago, and the rickshaw can be replaced by the small steamboat. Even such a small place is gradually approaching science.</p>
<p>When the ferry arrived at the dock, I really wanted to take the newly sailed small steamboat, and my heart was dominated by a kind of novelty desire.</p>
<p>The dock was as crowded as before with a group of laborers, shouting, waving, and competing for customers' luggage.</p>
<p>"Two mao to Louzhen! Two mao! Only two mao!" A clear voice entered my ears.</p>
<p>"Mr. So-and-so hasn't returned to his hometown for a long time!"</p>
<p>It turned out that Ajiang was still doing his rickshaw pulling career. Because of his warm greetings, my desire to take the small steamboat changed again, and I blindly stepped on Ajiang's rickshaw.</p>
<p>Ajiang is old, and his back seems to be very hunched.</p>
<p>Most of the thirty or forty passengers on the ferry transferred to the small steamboat. Only four people took the rickshaw, including me. Most of the rickshaw pullers were still standing at the dock, staring blankly at the small steamboat rushing away. Our four rickshaws passed through the bustling town and moved forward in a vast green field.</p>
<p>I asked Ajiang, "Has Louzhen changed anything?"</p>
<p>"It's still the same old way, except that East Street was burned down in a fire. Besides, we rickshaw pullers are afraid that we will have no food to eat soon."</p>
<p>"How come? Aren't you still pulling rickshaws?"</p>
<p>"Oh, sir, don't you know? With the small steamboat, we won't have rickshaws!" He coughed and choked, paused, and said again, "We have a big price cut, two mao to Louzhen, but the guests still take the one-mao-five steamboat. We also have to go to Louzhen for one mao five, and the car pull is used as a steamboat!"</p>
<p>My heart was immediately pressed down by the heavy pain of lead. A magnificent scene of the struggle between human power and machines unfolded before me.</p>
<p>The earth mounds undulated. The steamboat also turned into the Hengli River in front. A wisp of black smoke curled into the air from the water, and it called out "Gua—Gua—" twice. In the lonely sky, there was still only the sound of the rattling of the rickshaws.</p>
<p>"Damn it, the heart of the old man, Li, is as black as charcoal. He rents cars to us on one hand..."</p>
<p>He suddenly stopped, but undoubtedly, he was full of anger.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Hmph, we rented cars from him, and he went to drive a small steamboat. Damn it, the car rent can't be reduced by a penny."</p>
<p>Ajiang was completely emotional, and he coughed and choked even more.</p>
<p>The rickshaw arrived at the door of my house. I took out four mao of small silver coins for this man with a sweaty head. He seemed surprised by my behavior. He probably thought that the price of four mao had become a redundant number under the current situation.</p>
<p>The white silver coin stayed in his palm for thirty seconds before he hunched his back, said a solemn thank you, and left.</p>
<p>It was already late, and black fog had shrouded the low eaves.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Review of "A History of China" <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Xing</p>
<p>— Published by the Cultural Society in front of Hepingmen, Beiping. Four volumes, priced at $8.20 —</p>
<p>For the past several thousand years, Chinese history has been recorded by scholars employed by the imperial court, according to the imperial court's wishes. Therefore, even if you read all of the Twenty-Four Histories, Twenty-Five Histories, all of the historical books of past China, all that you can see are the words and deeds of emperors and nobles, the accomplishments of wise rulers and loyal ministers, and the crimes of rebellious officials and traitors. As for the economic conditions of each era, the state of social life, and the social causes of various historical events, those are nowhere to be found. The most interesting thing in all of this is the "praise and blame" attitude of the "historians;" this is the so-called "the victor is king, the loser is bandit" attitude. Under this attitude, actions such as "Tang banishing Jie," "King Wu attacking Zhou," Wang Mang destroying the Western Han, the Cao family usurping the throne, Li Yuan destroying the Sui, and even Huang Chao raising an army, although fundamentally similar in nature, are treated differently under the "praise and blame" of those "historians." The successful ones, whose power lasted longer, are praised as righteous armies, removing harm for the people, even fabricating myths, calling them "ordained by Heaven." Otherwise, they are treacherous officials usurping the throne and murdering the ruler, or bandits plotting rebellion. Therefore, even now, we cannot rely on existing historical materials to scientifically and systematically organize a true history of China.</p>
<p>Of course, in the current situation, anyone who can scientifically and systematically organize a history of China would be making a great contribution. But if someone still follows the methods of those "historiographers" of the past autocratic era, adopting the "the victor is king, the loser is bandit" attitude of "praise and blame," and copies a history of China from the "official histories," then this undertaking is not only equivalent to doing nothing at all, but also reveals the vulgarity of the person doing it, lacking any new historical perspective. However, such a vulgar person doing such a thing already exists: Mr. Wang Tongling. His "History of China" is copied from the so-called "official histories."</p>
<p>It sounds a bit scary, but Mr. Wang Tongling's "History of China" consists of four massive volumes, over two thousand pages, with at least a million words. But if you consider that the "official histories" of all Chinese dynasties are readily available, and copying all the official histories of the dynasties of the past several thousand years into one pile to copy, then compiling a large book of several million words probably wouldn't be that difficult. However, leaving that aside, let's talk more specifically about the content of Mr. Wang's "History of China."</p>
<p>In the "General Principles" of the "History of China," there is a clause that says: "The style of this compilation is a general history, paying the most attention to the rise and fall of the nation and the prosperity and demise of the country. All matters concerning rise, fall, prosperity, and demise are described in detail, with their causes and results, to serve as a lesson for the present and future generations." From this, it seems that the compiler of this book is quite nationalistic. But when we open the first page of the book, what the compiler uses to replace the first preface is a short essay on Chinese history written by a certain doctor from a certain country. After recounting the course of past Chinese history from his own standpoint, the author made the following conclusion: "For the sake of China, uniting with the country geographically closest and the nation culturally most similar, supporting each other to resist European and American nations, protect our own nation, and preserve our own culture, is this not the urgent task of the present era? Failing to do so, and 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　, repeating the mistake of allying with the Mongols to destroy the Jin, one day if there is a change, it will not only endanger the independence of the Han nation-state but also affect the survival of Han culture." This statement is enough to show how clear the compiler's national consciousness really is.</p>
<p>Secondly, the first chapter of the "Introduction" of the "History of China" says: "History studies the evolution of mankind, the development of society..." This again shows that the author of this book seems to understand a bit of evolutionary viewpoint. But in reality, this large book is written entirely from an anti-evolutionary standpoint. If one truly had an evolutionary perspective, one would explain the various political and cultural changes and developments by the changes and developments of the social foundations. But the author of this book, regarding the wars between the feudal lords in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, the learning of the various schools of thought, and the unification of Qin and its policies, regarding the well-field system implemented by Wang Mang, regarding the learning of the Song Dynasty... etc., only narrates their phenomena according to the "official histories," and does not explain the emergence, development, and decline of these phenomena from an evolutionary point of view, from the changes in the social foundation, that is, does not socially elucidate the objective significance of these phenomena. Therefore, such a large "History of China" has actually become a thing that is entirely a pile of facts, without scientific explanation, truly like a large ledger of the past several thousand years.</p>
<p>Of course, the main characteristic of this book is the narration of facts based on the "official histories." If it were truly a rigid narration of true historical facts, then it could perhaps serve as a kind of reference material. But many of the past historical records of China are not true. If we have no historical perspective at all and just compile a history of China based on past records, then we will make a big joke. For example, the legends of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, and the many myths of the various dynasties, have very little truth to them. We should deal with them with a critical attitude and should not blindly copy them from old books. However, this book, "History of China," copies the history of the Yellow Emperor, Yao, Shun, etc., as before; some of the unreasonable myths are also written in the book. Please see the following record:</p>
<p>"Chi You, the ruler of the Nine Li, rebelled and led his army north, seizing the Yellow River basin. Emperor Yan Yu Gang fled to Zhuolu. Xuanyuan Shi raised troops to quell the rebellion, leading the feudal lords, and fought Chi You in the wilderness of Zhuolu. Chi You could make fog, causing the soldiers to be confused. Xuanyuan made a compass chariot to show the four directions, and then captured and killed Chi You. This was the beginning of the war between the Han and Miao tribes."</p>
<p>We do not believe that in ancient times there was a Chi You who could make smoke bombs, "could make fog." It is natural that the invention of the compass by Xuanyuan Huangdi has a historical origin, and that this invention is also related to his war with Chi You, but this is definitely not because Chi You could make smoke bombs, "could make fog." The actual situation may have been that during the war between the Yellow Emperor and Chi You, because of changes in the climate, a thick fog arose in the air, which stimulated the Yellow Emperor to invent the compass to show the direction. This is more 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　It is also possible to write about the legend of Chi You being "able to make fog," but it must be critically examined with a scientific perspective and cannot be rigidly copied to mislead the reader. In fact, there are many wonderful and mysterious legends in the past history books of China. The rise and fall of each dynasty, and even the life and death of the emperors and ministers of each dynasty, as well as the order and chaos of the world, can be said to have mysterious historical explanations. If we copy them all down without criticism, wouldn't that be too ridiculous? However, the author of the "History of China" even copied the mysterious legend of Chi You being "able to make fog." This has no meaning other than showing his shallow scientific and historical knowledge.</p>
<p>In addition, the author of the "History of China," like the "historiographers" of the past, holds the "praise and blame" attitude of "the victor is king, the loser is bandit." Therefore, his attitude towards Tang banishing Jie, King Wu attacking Zhou, Li Yuan destroying the Sui, and Wang Mang destroying the Western Han, and the behavior of Cao Cao and Cao Pi towards Emperor Xian of Han, are completely different: he praises the former and scolds the latter. This is needless to say because the power of the former lasted longer, while the power of the latter lasted shorter. However, according to the author himself, his historical attitude is still very objective!</p>
<p>Although this "History of China" is already so large, it has not yet been completed; it has only been compiled to the mid-Qing Dynasty, and the history of the late Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China remains to be continued. Let's wait and see. However, for the benefit of readers, I dare not recommend this book.</p>

<p>It is said that Western blue-eyed people have a form of entertainment called "dancing." This kind of gentle exercise is said to be very beneficial to physical health and is also a common etiquette in social circles. A few years ago, so-called "song and dance performances" also appeared in our Chinese primary schools. This may have been the effect of Westernized education at the time! And at that time, it was indeed a fad. Starting with Grape Fairies, Moonlit Nights, and fine drizzles, Little Sister I Love You, from six- or seven-year-old girls who had not yet lost their infantile smell to seventeen- or eighteen-year-old girls of a delightful age, all were skilled in dancing. Therefore, when singing and dancing almost became the only teaching achievement of primary schools, the number of parent-teacher conferences and recreational activities held in schools also increased significantly.
