<p>太田答覆指出齊齊哈爾條的未被滿洲國所承認、乃因該約未經批准、</p>
<p>斯氏答謂、齊齊哈爾條約不必批准、故簽字後卽發生效力、該條的之實施及雙方負責遵守、且曾於一九一一年十二月十六日及二十日由俄國北京代辦及中國外長互換文書、予以證實、斯氏表示、事實旣已絕對明白、希望日本政府利用彼對「滿洲國」政府之勢力、使其負擔彼所承認之義務、尊重疆界並使此後不再發生與此同性質之衝突、關於太田要求、斯氏允代轉達關係當局、令其調查日本騎兵越境事件、（二日塔斯電）</p>

<h3>南京市　辦理小本借貸情形　辦理以來頗具成效　現仍推廣救濟工商</h3>
<p>南京通信、南京自奠都以來、市民驟增、據最近統計、數額已逾百萬、以常理論、市民加多、市塲興盛、自爲可喜之現象、惟首都爲一政治區、對於才力勞力之需用、當有一定數量、人口逾量增加、需求不相適應、則失業問題、隨之而生、且年來國民經濟、日形枯竭、故京市小本農工商業者、亦多呈疲敝之勢、影響所及、不惟障碍繁榮市面、阻止農村復興、抑於社會人心、關係允鉅、京市府有鑒於此、爰籌資舉辦小本貸欵、以爲根本救濟、施行以來、頗具成效、詳細情形、分述於次、</p>
<p>貸欵種類</p>
<p>貸欵種類、分為農·工·商·業三種、借欵額由六元起至二百元止、如有事實需要、必須爲二百元以上之貸欵者、事先應呈由市府核准、貸欵利率、規定六元至二十元者、月息七厘、二十一元至五十元者、八厘、五十一元至一百元者、九厘、一百零一元至二百元者、一分、是貸欵逾少者、其利率逾低、</p>
<p>還欵辦法</p>
<p>還欵期限、最長不得超過一年、分爲定期·活期·分期·三種、共中以分期攤還辦法、最爲便利、如借欵十元者、每月抽還本金二元、五個月還淸、此種辦法、輕而易舉、貸欵人可不因還欵而影響其業務、借貨處更可運用此種貸欵而爲普遍借貸、</p>
<p>貧民貸欵</p>
<p>此外、京市府爲救濟一般貧苦無告無資謀生之市民起見、特於上項小本貸欵之外、舉辦一額翁民貸欵、每戶借貸欵額、以五元爲限、分五個月還淸、不取利息、</p>
<p>按京市已往借貸情形、高利貸印子錢無論矣、卽普通銀行之貸欵、其利息亦較小本借貸處之利息爲高、據借貸處借戶報吿、其本人曾在銀行為二百元之貸欵、月息八厘、以預扣利息及手續費筆墨費等、共扣去二十二元之多、借欵額二百元、實得僅一百七十八元、較諸小本借貸之分期還欵、借欵二百元、年僅納利息十一元、相差不啻霄壤、故此種小本借貸、實爲眞正與人民有利之救濟事業、</p>
<p>推廣辦法</p>
<p>綜觀京市年餘以來之貨欵情形、於小本工商之救濟、確收有相當成效、京市府爰更力爲推廣、普遍救濟、其詳如下、</p>
<p>增加小本借貸資金、京市小本貸欵基金原爲十五萬元、施行以來、各業民衆、以利輕而手續簡便、故申請借貸者日益加多、原有基金、遂感不足應付、京市府乃更籌添基金五萬元、以便普遍借貸、廣爲救濟、</p>
<p>擴充農業貸欵、京市小本貸欵、以前原限於工商兩業、於農民不免偏枯、因同時擴充農業貸欵、將小本借貸種類、擴充為農工商業三種、現農民已紛紛申請借貸、借貸處及鄕區代辦所、大有應接不暇之勢、</p>
<p>提倡工商業　各種生產運銷合作社、京市小本工商、於供求狀態、多不精詳、致營業有時趨於失敗、爲使其對於生產知求改良、對於供求知所趨避起見、京市小本借貸處、擬提倡組織上項合作社、予以合作貸欵、</p>
<p>提倡組織　人力車夫合作社、京市人力車、約在九千輛以上、以拉車為生者、不下萬人、（以拉車為臨時副業者不在此列）其中車輛、大都由車行租來、自有者蓋極少數、而車行藉此營利、平均每一車租出、日須租金五角至六角左右、如車夫能日拉一元、則所納租金以日息計算、卽合五十分以上矣、如予以貸欵救濟、按市價每車一輛、約需六十元左右、車夫貨欵自購、予以還欵之特別便利、（如按日還欵二角、一月還欵六元、十個月可還淸六十元、）十個月後、車子卽屬己有、如此、車夫旣免除車行租金之剝削、則盡一日之勞力、不難養家糊口、幷作養老防災之積蓄矣、　規定農業貸欵範圍、提倡農民副業、農村經濟崩潰主因、固由於天災人患、而農民生產方式、一守成規、不知改善、平時旣毫無準備、一旦遭遇意外、立致束手無策、京市小本借貸處、有鑒於此、爰擬規定凡農民主業、如耕牛·種籽·施肥·購置農具·以及掘井·築堤·關於改良生產一切設備、均可貸欵、幷提倡農民種植花果·菜蔬·以及養猪·鷄·鴨·魚·蜂·蠶等、較有規模之生產副業、以便貸欵經營、</p>

<p>無期徒刑　張小四子處有期徒刑二十年、先後確定在案、是唐嘉鵬之死、固爲趙廣福等加害、然其殺人之動機、是否出於上訴人顧竹軒之敎唆、自以有無確實證據爲斷、據告發人趙廣福在警務處供、民國二十二年六月十六日上午、有友人周明祥卽周二木匠又稱周小木匠來稱、有顧竹軒（卽顧四老　）欲打死彼之仇人、邀余參加、余卽允諾、余倆立至紫來街顧竹軒所設之亞洲旅館二樓二百〇八號房間內、不久、顧竹軒入室、周卽爲余介紹叫老闆、顧卽聲稱彼有</p>
<p>重要仇人　爲大世界經理、須將伊打死、令余等放心做去、事成給余等四人大洋一萬元、後顧竹軒卽去、周明祥又邀余等同至閘北恒豐路仁和茶樓、會見其餘之人、到茶樓後、有五六人來詢周明祥、余知其中有主金奎·張小四子·等語、質之上訴人、堅不承認與告發人在旅館會見及敎唆殺人情事、並稱與唐嘉鵬素識、又無仇怨、無呌人暗殺之理、現在他們爲索詐不遂、想出法子來咬我、第一審判處罪刑、眞是寃沉海底云云、本院查張小四子及趙廣福殺人案件、自二十一年十月間卽繫屬於第一審法院、迄上訴至第三審法院、歷時一年有餘、始終未據</p>
<p>供明殺害　唐嘉鵬爲上訴人所指使、卽吿發主興高時、在警務處供六月十六日先出周二木匠在仁和茶樓介紹與王興高認識、後同往公共租界大江南旅館二層樓一房中有年約五十餘歲之人入內、由王興高指吿為顧四老闆等語、核其所述、介紹與上訴人會面情形、已屬先後歧異、迭經研訊吿發人關於此種之供述、歷决均不相同、　參閱趙廣福張小四子殺人案、王興高敎唆殺人案、及本案各審卷宗）、又會商殺人地點、吿發人忽稱公共租界大江南旅、忽稱愛多亞路大江南旅館（王興高二十四年一月八日吿發狀）、自訴狀上又爲</p>
<p>亞洲旅館　二樓二百〇八號、（吿發人於吿發之前、曾在原審提起自訴判决不受理、見二十四年七月十七日趙廣福自訴顧竹軒敎唆人卷）、經警務處詰以前後所述、何以不符、吿發人辯稱、因路徑不熟、前稱大江甫旅館、係屬錯悞、實爲法租界愛多亞路亞洲旅館會見顧四老闆云云、（第一審卷五四頁）姑無論大江南旅館（係上訴人開設）不在愛多亞路而在公共租界、該館二樓不是旅館、又無二百〇八號房間、經該館經理趙荃孫在原審述明、至亞洲旅館前雖為江南旅館、但江南已於十九年二月間倒閉、嗣</p>
<p>改為大陸　再易爲亞洲、已據警員沈篤楊查明報吿在卷、（原審卷第一七七頁）則亞洲雖係由江南旅館遞嬗而來、其非大江南旅館至為明顯、原審認定大江南旅館卽係亞洲旅館、未免率斷、况吿發人經警務處派員帶往愛多亞路亞洲旅館實地查勘、吿發人前至二樓、遲疑不决、待數分鐘之找尋、及依照房門上之號數、始覔到第二百〇八號房間、（見原審卷第五十六頁）足見該吿發人所稱在該館第二百〇八號與上訴人會晤一節、尙難徵信、又酬金數目、吿發人在王興高案中謂事成山王給我百元、至本案則稱顧四允給余等四人</p>
<p>洋一萬元　不惟與證人張小四子所稱四人每人一萬元、大相徑庭、矧吿發人等均係勞動工人、上訴人縱令與人有仇、何至允給巨萬之多、亦出乎常情之外、再查吿發人在監、因見東方雜誌上有上訴人照相、知爲天蟾舞台老板有錢、起意向之要借三千元、如借不到、要求同監人薛振翼想法子吿他、並的薛振翼作證人借到後、許以三七分拆、迭據薜振翼供明在卷、（見原審二十四年九月二十七日筆錄在本審供述亦同）並有張書川結證、當時在塲聽到屬實、（原審二十四年十月十二日筆錄）嗣因薛振翼迭函上訴人</p>
<p>勸令接濟　（原函附第一審證物卷）上訴人置之不理、薛振翼又移押他號、該吿發人用鉛筆作函、（見證物卷第七號）囑同鹽人犯張臣良帶交薛振翼、業據薛振翼在原審呈案、該函內稱、「振翼先生大鹽、蒙你過去待我很好、現在還要請求你幫我一次忙、如我不論弄到多少錢、都要提三成、酬勞你的恩情、望你千萬不要推卻、王興高被我吿進來、我本想弄他一千塊、現在已判了罪、我心中不忍再問他要錢、（中略）現在我要告幾個有錢的人、狀紙早呈上去、至今沒有信息、我邀你替我想法子、做一個證人不要緊的、告幾個有錢的人、狀紙早呈上去、至今沒有信息、我邀你替我想法子、做一個證人不要緊的、告訴機個</p>
<p>大資本家　他們用得起、不傷德、如吿不進來、我無期徒刑、官司不怕、加幾年誣吿罪、有錢的人是怕下面子、用三千五千、也不在乎、我現在想敲顧四老板三千塊、（中略）如不與我接頭、我預備幾塊錢的狀子過幾一張到法院、你以前說顧四老板是紅十字會特別會員、所以我請你替我做設人、我到法院說你是他的學生、我本當在看守所上訴時卽要吿的、因爲你代表顧四老板接頭、代請律師代做狀子、說宜吿無罪、現在不成（當爲曾字之意）宣吿無罪才吿的、我閘北有個姓黃的朋友、我呌他和我打聽好了顧的人樣子和汽車號頭、我上决把你看</p>
<p>東方雜誌　有顧四老板的像、我看的很淸楚、見臉卽認得了、請你放心、將來與我做證人只（當為這字之意）一竹槓定能敲到、與你三七拆、你的口供、千萬不要忘記了、我有機會與你當面談、祝你台安、七月十四日上午、趙廣福條云云、此函告發人雖否認為伊所寫、但經本院當庭核對筆跡、其趙廣福三字、用筆結構姿勢、與原函具名趙廣福三字、完全相符、他如原函上（我）字·（心）字·（資本家）三字·（錢）字等·與筆跡上相同者、不一而足、况吿發人寫就後、託由張臣良遞交薛翼經張臣良在</p>
<p>两審證明　屬實、（見一審卷二十四年十月十二日及二審卷二十五年二月四日筆錄）是該函為吿發人之親筆、固無欵義、且函中吿發次及請薛振翼出為僞證、不怕再加誣告罪等計劃周至、更足證明該告發人為敲詐不遂、始行起意勾串指告、初非因上訴人確有敎唆害唐嘉鵬之事、而出頭吿發、其訴意至為明顯、又在東方雜誌上看清上訴人照像、幷記閘北黃姓打聽上訴人人樣子和汔車號頭、可見吿發人與上訴人先不相識、其前述在亞洲旅館與上訴人會面之說、全屬虛構、該函自可為上訴人有利之反證、至證人張小四子雖</p>
<p>一再供明　殺害唐嘉鵬、係受上訴人之敎唆、但吿發人於吿發之後、經警務處提同張小四子薛振翼押在一起、趙廣福與張小四子商量一個星期、（二十四年十一月二十七日筆錄）張小四子不會講話、趙廣福敎他如何說顧竹軒拿出手槍來、（見二十五年三月四日筆錄）均經薛振翼供明、而張小四子亦自認趙福對我說過敎我咬他、（指上訴人）事辦好鐵沒有不諱、是該證人之證言、係由吿發人勾串而來、自不足採、複查第二特區監獄發現銀行存摺、上訴人涉有</p>
<p>敎唆翻供　嫌疑二節、雖經張小四子供明在逃看守馬獻祥吿知係顧四女人拿出錢來、由顧三（上訴人之兄名松茂）等存入銀行、其存摺馬獻祥給我閱看、囑我翻供、爲我奪下云云、訊據上訴人謂身在押所、銀行存欵、無由知悉、卽質之上訴人之親屬顧松茂·顧李氏·鄭絨三·等、亦均吾認其事、是存入銀行之欵、究自何來、尙屬無從證明、綜核前述、旣不能證明上訴人確有敎唆殺人情事、則該項存摺、縱係上訴人之家屬所爲、亦難據此爲上訴人</p>
<p>論罪基礎　按犯罪事實、應依證據認定之刑事訴訟法二百六十八條定有明文、上訴人對於敎唆殺害唐嘉鵬之事實、旣無積極證據、堪資認定、殊難令負刑事責任、原審率以敎唆殺人論罪科刑、自不足以昭折服、上訴人之上訴、不得謂無理由、應山本院撒銷原判决、論知上訴人無罪、據上論結、應依刑事訴訟法第三百六十一條第一項·第三百五十六條·第二百九十三條第一項·判决如主文、本案經本院檢察官趙士北蒞庭執行職務、不服本判决、應於送達後十日內、向本院提出書狀、幷叙述理由、上訴於最高法院、</p>

<h3>世運代表團隨征記</h3>
<p>— 中央社特派員馮有真</p>
<p>我國體育史上劃時代的壯舉</p>
<p>世界亞林匹克運動大會、發源於希臘、已是二千七百多年以前的事了、當初規定每四年舉行一次、可是第十三次大會舉行後、因希臘文化的沒落、大會隨之終止、直到十九世紀的末葉、靠法人寇佩汀爵士（Baron　Peirre　de　Coubetin）的努力經營、始於一八九四年六月、在巴黎舉行的國際體育會議、復興了近代亞林匹克大會（Mobein　Olympic　Games）接著在一八九六年於希臘的京城雅典舉行第一次大會、此後每隔四年、分別在各國的首都或大都市舉行大會一次、每次參加的各國選手、多至三千余人、少亦四五百人、堪稱國際競技中唯一的勝會、到現在已經舉行大會十次、具有四十年的歷史了、</p>
<p>我國參加這種國際競技勝會、始於一九三二年在美國洛杉磯舉行的第十屆大會、但是那只有短跑先手劉長春一人、由職員沈嗣良宋君復率領參加、我們青天白日滿地紅的國旗、雖然在那次起、已在亞林匹克大會場中豎立了起來、但是實際講來、那次衹能算是試探的性質、</p>
<p>本年八月一日、在德京柏林開幕的第十一屆大會、我國正式派遣各項選手及職員體育考察團、一行共一百多人、浩浩蕩蕩去參加大書特書的、自然、以我們選手的成績、去和各國名手相較、真是如小巫之遇大巫、要獲勝得分、全是夢想奢望、但是我們的選手、都已具有相當的基礎、不難因參加這次大會、而在技術上多得一點經驗、使我們運動的水凖提高、全國人民對體育的興趣、亦隨之加增、為我國的體育打開一條新的路線、劃分一個新的時代、那末這次萬裏長征的壯舉、雖然化費了一二十萬民脂民膏、決不是毫無意義的、</p>
<p>代表團的陣容</p>
<p>我國這次參加的項目、計有足球·籃球·田徑·競走·游泳·舉重·自由車·拳擊等八項正式項目、與國術表演、此外尚有體育考察團一行三十余人、亦隨同赴德、（全體名單、早經發表、故從略）一行共計一百四十四人、其中戴王二氏已先期啟程、足球隊亦先赴南洋一帶比賽、預定七月九日在孟買歸隊集合、此外除駐德代表早已抵達、游泳選手在香港登輪外、其餘人員、都於六月二十六日在上海乘載郵輪康特浮臺號出發、尚有中國旅行社組織的觀光團、共三十一、亦隨輪同行、</p>
<p>辭別了祖國</p>
<p>民國二十五年六月二十六日的正午、代表團基本隊仿、在上海招商北機乘義大利郵船公司的康特浮臺輪出國長征、輪埠、上適如意料的浮動了一幕熱烈的景象、排列在碼頭上的幾千位觀送人員、不時的觀呼呐喊、鏗鏘悠揚的軍樂聲中、一陣陣的夾雜爆竹的響聲、加以翱翔在天空中的飛機、使大家的情緒都緊張到了極度、十二點一刻郵船上的銅鑼發出了別離的最後警告、站在碼頭上與靠著船舷的歡送者與遠征者、忙亂碰上擲五色的彩帶、交織成一張充滿了熱情的羅綱、問是船身在汽笛長鳴聲中、漸漸的移動了、漸漸的漸漸的把這　滿了別離的熱情的彩帶斷裂了、彼此揮巾搖手、互相觀呼後、我們眼看著碼頭上的人影、搖動消散、於是辭別了祖國、踏上萬裏迢迢的征塵、記者現在坐吸煙室中、提筆開始寫這隨征記、雖然已時隔一時有餘、並且輪機的震動聲、擾鬧得頭錯眼花、可是這幕熱烈的離別的景象、深刻在我的腦海中、並沒有絲毫消散、</p>
<p>輪中雜記</p>
<p>義大利郵船公司航行印度洋、往返於威尼司、上海間的輪船、共有三艘、康特浮臺·康特羅梭·維多利亞·據說維多利來是最新建築的、設備亦最佳、康特浮臺則為最大的一艘、共一萬八千七百六十五噸、船上職員、自船長以迄夥夫、完全是義大利人、茶役均穿白色制服、能操英語、態度亦彬彬有禮、艙位分頭等二等經濟二等、與三等四等四種、頭等設備當然是最講究、每艙一鋪、佈置十分雅潔、此外如吸煙室、都是金壁輝煌、陳設富麗、音樂室裏的壁畫、充分的表現著義大利藝術的情調、晚間音樂室奏著高尚的音樂、甲板上開映著名貴的電影、使每個旅客可以忘掉旅途中一切的煩悶、但是這種優越的權利、除掉頭等旅客外、沒有其他的人可以享受的、晚餐的時候、都要穿上禮服、這對於有許多人、也許會感著麻煩吧、</p>
<p>二等與經濟二等的設備、大致相彷、較之頭等則相差很遠、三等艙就是統艙、當你走過那裏的時候、一股惡濁的臭氣、猛列的刺到你的鼻管裏、使你發嘔、聽說各國的郵船公司、為了競爭營業、都竭力在頭等艙上設法講究、對於二三等旅客的利益、是不太注意的、在充滿了銅臭氣味的資本主義國家裏、這種情形、我想是不足為奇的、我們的代表團中、祇郝更生沈嗣良二位代表和德國顧部柯特是住的頭等艙、其余都住經濟二等、但是船上艙位不夠、所以有一部份女　選手與職員住到二等艙去、經濟二等一室四人、船價由上海到威尼司來回原定七十八鎊、這次因優待我國選手、特折價至四十五鎊、二等約加半數、頭等再加二等之半、</p>
<p>每天膳食四次、早晨七至九時早餐、十一時半午餐、下午四時午茶、六時半晚餐、因為這次突然增加大批旅客、餐桌不夠分配、所以每餐又分兩次、第一次是我們代表團、第二次是其他的旅客、</p>
<p>午晚兩餐、是每天主要的餐食、一杯清湯、一杯冷水、一塊硬麵包、三道菜、一樣水果、在份量上只有多餘、可是在質量上、實在不敢恭維、除掉一杯清湯、味尚可口外、三道菜都凍宿不堪、發出酸味、麵包硬得幾乎嚼不動、但味很香、有許多人因菜蔬不能下咽、反以麵包與冰水為果腹之品、調味祇鹽與粗胡椒兩樣、早餐與午茶、則有奶油果醬、並可吸一杯檸檬茶、或牛奶咖啡、據說輪船上所備的食品、都是在威尼司開船前裝足的、除是萬不得已、他們決不在其他地方補充食料、這樣經過二十多天的航程、由上海折回威尼司時、所有儲藏在冰箱中的食料、當然會味同嚼臘、更說不到營養料了、其實這種情形、也不僅是義大利郵船公司如此、所有現在稱為一等強國的國家、沒有一國不是抱著只用本國貨的信念的、祇有我們中國、在這國難嚴重的時候、還有幫運幫銷私貨的現象發生、當我每次走進餐室的時候、對他們這種樸質切實的精神、直覺得慚愧、</p>
<p>船上浴室很多、每天洗一鎰澡、並無問題、但是因為洗衣儲存量有限、所以必須先用混濁的海水洗身、然後再用清水淋浴　Shower　Bath洗衣服價錢很貴、汗衫褲每件五硬士、線質或毛質八便士、　衫價格相同、襪每對一便士、絲毛質加倍、手帕價格相同、選手們都在晚上自己洗、</p>
<p>經濟二等有一條不公開的路通頭二等艙、如果你願意去的話、他們也不進干涉、這或許是優待選手的原因吧、但是住在經濟二等的選手、對自已的生活、都覺得安適、除萬不得已外、少有到那邊去的、</p>

<h3>主婦的十項要則</h3>
<p>— 範顯微</p>
<p>主婦為家庭中的重要角色，她的一言一動，影響於子女和　　者，至　　大　　如那主婦自己先常常要出口　罵，怎能禁住别人不罵人？自己先常常貪懶得很，怎能呌别人勸　做事？俗語說得好：「見好樣，學好樣」，這句話一點不錯，下面十項，都是主婦該躬行實踐的，深望一般太太奶奶們遵守着！</p>
<p>一每天早上，第一個起身，率子女等舉行深呼吸十五分鐘，晚間前後察看一次，最後一個睡覺。</p>
<p>二每天親自到小　場上去辦案，帶回來親手調煮，勿假手於僕人。</p>
<p>三每晚登伙食賑，核計多寡，月終總結一次。</p>
<p>四早晚督令子女溫習各課。</p>
<p>五每天檢查各項家具清潔與否，每星期大掃除一次。</p>
<p>六不賭錢，不罵人，不燙髮，不吃烟酒，不塗脂粉，不　高跟鞋。</p>
<p>七不燒香唸經，不涉足下流遊樂場。</p>
<p>八星期日帶着子女等，作户外活動一次，像遊玩公園郊外行等。</p>
<p>九吃的，穿的，非國貨不買，非酬酢不御華服。</p>
<p>十對待丈夫要友愛懇摯，可順則忍而順之，萬一不可忍，（像夫有外遇，嗜好等，）宜以婉言勸導之，母疾言厲色！對待傭人要寬恕和善，偶有小過，則誘導而糾正之，亦勿形諸辭色，管教子女，完全取感化方法，絕對不用舊式的謾罵和體罰。</p>
<h3>女子畢業後的迫切問題</h3>
<p>— 錫山</p>
<p>——婚嫁？就業？——</p>
<p>這的確是一個頗佔嚴重的問題，當一個年青的女子畢業，跨出校門之後，還是應該婚嫁？或是應該就業？</p>
<p>要談這二個問題，首先應牽及的：就是在一個年青的女子畢業後，其生活是否是繼續的依賴於家庭？否則，就應謀得其經濟上的獨立，因為經濟就是促成畢業後二大問題的先決條件我們知道，一個女子尚在學校生活的時代，其一切金錢上的使用，都得由家裏的父兄，或是親戚等來擔負，但，一旦畢業後，家庭方面的經濟供給者，是否能繼續的保持原狀，這便成為了一個問題，同時你一輩子，普通一般的情形，但為之急就婚姻，雖然婚嫁是以屬於一個女子必須的過程，可是，在這類場合之下的婚事，是很難產生美滿的幸福的，事實很明顯的告知我們。一個女子的結婚佳日，也就是等於她全部志願消滅的一天，而且，目前女子的不能得到經濟上的獨立，其在任何方面，都不能獲得優越的地位。</p>
<p>惟其如此，女子畢業後的第二問題，就產生在就業的上面了，就業。一方面是可使自己獲得經濟上的獨立，一方面是可使自己在生活上得到自由，本來，女子的就業，不一定須要跟社會相接觸，像過去，中國的家庭中是盛行着手工業的生產，可是，現今科學的發達，機械的大量生產。早將手工業的制度，破落到無可存在的地位，女子在家庭裏，根本不想再希冀得到些兒經濟上的相助，因之，現今　的女子要謀經濟上的獨立，就不能不跟社會相接觸，這樣，在女子職業服務之下，也就產生了一種遍見的恶習：「薰染劣風，」這是目前女子就業上最不易免去的事件，尤其是在萬恶的大都市裏，像由於應酬，起於模倣，受於接觸，間接地，直接地都極易使一個女子染上種種不良之風；而將自己的身體日形的放浪起來，在歐美各國女子就業的最盛區，大部的女性，都染上不良的恶習，例如：狂嗜烟酒濫交異性一……，所以種種流產，墮胎，私生兒……的事件，在那些地方也就發生得特别的多，這點，就足以給我們作一個明顯的例證其次損害健康也是目下女子就業上所不能免除的，因為女子的身體，不論從生理的結構上或是體力的强度上來說，都是不及男子，當然，其不能跟男子任同一的勞役，但，事實上，有很多的商店和公司，其對於女子工作的時間上，職務上，却都跟男子同样，因之女子就很容易发生劳働过度的象　，　，對於身體的健康是有着莫大的損害。</p>
<p>那末，女子畢業以後究竟是應結婚？或是應就業，這二個問題，我們從許多過去事實的例證歸納起來，在結論下　直找不出一個具體的和確切的答案來。</p>
<p>但末了，我謹盼　　一位畢業後的女子，對於這二個切身的問題，應予以嚴重的注意才是。</p>
<h3>兩性間道德觀念的轉移</h3>
<p>— 夢蘇</p>
<p>两性问题之在今日，大部分人依然把着不合理的见解。社会中的罪恶，有一大部分是起源于性的问题的。理智之光，尚未能把两性间撥雲霧而見青天。要改造社會，非把這些傳統的謬　概念，重行估計，是没有希望的。現代的婦女運動，可算是向着這條新的道路進行着。</p>
<p>大凡不平的事實，是由畸形的環境和習俗造成的。新社會的建設，要使兩性之間的性行為必出於合法的婚　。非正式夫婦的雜交的行為，必須取締，一夫一妻的制度必須確立。</p>
<p>一夫一妻的遵守，第一是由於所處的境遇。例如住居在人口稀少的鄉村之中，夫婦之間，朝夕廝守。男子既不大離家遠行，與其他婦女接觸機會較少，那末這男女之間很容易篤於自己的伉儷之情的。但倘若男子獨自離家遠行，或置身於都會之中，那就比較不容易使這男子不犯二色之戒了。</p>
<p>第二是由於宗教的信仰。宗教常以女色為大戒；尤其是淫人妻女，將墮入地獄，或受陰隲報應之果。於是一般人怵於冥冥之罰而守身如玉。這在普通社會間，影響也是很大的。</p>
<p>第三是由於社會制裁。凡薄倖男子與蕩婦淫娃，都是一般人所憎恶的。男子為了寶愛名譽，而不敢妄生踰牆鑽穴之想，女子恥貽桑間濮上之譏，而寗作投梭之拒。這樣便形成了一般的善良風俗。</p>
<p>在農業社會中，人民居處固定。鄉黨鄰里，一舉一動，都是彼此熟知的。凡束身自好的男女，為避免習俗的責備，彼此夫婦有别，不相侵越。至於近代的資本社會，每個都市之中，住民密集，　徙無定，雖比屋而居，每各不相識。浪跡的男女彼此之間，能否不至見異思　，是否保守著一夫一妻，誰也管不了誰。宗教上天堂地獄之說，早己不足牢籠人心。所謂傷風敗俗，人慾橫流的故事，便數見不鮮，熟視無覩了。</p>
<p>法律上雖規定了一夫一妻之制，而事實上朝秦暮楚的私姘野合，章　走馬的尋花問柳，形形色色，千奇百詭，造成了一夫多妻或一妻多夫的光怪陸離的污濁社會了。這樣，兩性間的道德問題，便無從說起。</p>
<p>道德與法律，原不是一成不變的。所謂良善道德與良好法律，須視其能否增進人類幸福以為斷。男女間的道德觀念和法律的立足點，都是隨著社會的經濟制度而轉移的。數千年來，所以成了男系社會，便是因為女子的經濟不能獨立。丈夫負擔養妻子的責任，妻子便成了丈夫的附屬品兩性間非法問題發生以後，女子所農桑的責備特重。一般世俗的見解，妻子不貞，丈夫便失去了體面。男子要保持體面，便有權對於女子施以禮教的束縛和法律的制裁。反過來說，男子不貞，在妻子方面至多不過是失寵；體面上算是没有損失。妻子對於丈夫，只限於婉言的規諷或反目的爭吵，却都不能施以道德和法律的制裁。這是男系制下自然產生的結果。如其社會經濟制度根本改變，這種道德觀念和法律的立足點便要根本動摇了。</p>
<p>現代男女問題中，女子比較得了些解放的，有兩種事實：一種是離婚的自由，一種是再醮的自由。在古代的中國社會，只有男子的片面出妻，而婦女方面，則嫁雞隨雞，嫁狗隨狗。倘使女子不滿意於丈夫而自由行動，便以「私奔」的恶謚相加。男人死了妻子，不妨為了膝下猶虛或中　管主的理由而一娶再娶。婦女喪其所天而一醮再醮，社會便要以冷眼相加。白香山的「婦人苦」是最能代伸女子的冤抑的。</p>
<p>「……人言夫婦親，並合如一身。至於死生際，何曾苦樂　　婦人　　　，　身守孤　，有如林中　，忽被風吹折，一折不　生，　死猶抱節。男兒若　　，　不暫傷情！應似門前柳，逢春易發榮；風吹一枝折，還有一枝生……」</p>
<p>這種不平之鳴，雖己隨時代而轉移，但根本觀念的改造，還有待於婦女界繼續的努力！</p>
<h3>嫠婦</h3>
<p>— 蟬衣</p>
<p>在她二十一歲的那年，丈夫就去世了，當她丈夫臨終的時候，曾囑咐她要為他守節，本來他們夫妻二人的感情，是非常的濃厚，在這永遠訣别的一刹那，她不顧一切，竟毅然答應丈夫的遺命了。</p>
<p>她果然變服毁容，　棄人間一切的歡樂，做一個永久的　婦，一直到她死去的時候為止。</p>
<p>許多人都替她傷心，這樣一個年輕的女子，竟遭到如此恶劣的命運，能為丈夫守節，這當然是好。可是，不能不注意到這不過是一時的感情所激動，能不能永久的不改變初衷，還是一個問題；與其以後發生了問題，不如現在不守，這話也很近情理。真的，一個年輕的少婦，能夠過一生孤寂的生活麼？</p>
<p>還有人說，守節，也得有可守的條件，第一是要有兒女，才有將來的希望，第二，没有兒女，也得有財產，可以使生活安逸下去，然而，這兩個條件，她完全没有，事實上她好像己没有苦守的可能了，但是，這些條件，是奪不了她那　　堅決的志向</p>
<p>家境本很清苦，生活完全由阿公與叔子維持，有時也有感到不足之　，在這清苦當中，她又與阿母做些針　，以添補不足，雖嘗盡百般的辛苦，她没有一點怨言。</p>
<p>從那時到現在，已經二十幾年的光景了，青春之期，也已經消逝，此後諒不至再有什麼問題發生，舊禮教的桎梏，使她成功了一個完人</p>
<p>現在，她己由叔子那裏承繼了一個兒子，那孩子今年只得三歲，却生得非常的活潑可愛，她終日抱在懷裏，吻着吻着，她想着未來的幸福，完全在這孩子身上的時候，不禁心花怒放，笑容佈滿在那蒼白的臉上，這蒼白的臉色，就是她過去青春期的苦悶的遺跡吧？</p>

<h3>醫藥手術下之易釵而弁者</h3>
<p>— 徐震池（寄自英倫）</p>
<p>昔　長恨歌　　　遂令天下父母心，不重生男重生女」，不禁油然生杜老「信知生男恶　，不如生女好」之感。及讀黄崇　女士，「幕府若容為坦腹，願天連變作男兒」之句，又覺此生得為男子，可　佳人，未始不為一快。但生殺予奪之　在天，性器官之審定，向不由人主宰，一切怨尤也，羨慕也，希望也，在男女本身，尚不過多此一舉而己，吾今　書而替古生生感　，保痴如之。然男女性器官生成，其果永遠不變耶？生而男女兩性器官均備，所謂陰陽人，雌　雄者，將　　？弁　　能不惹人笑話否？改變性器官，及改正性器官在醫藥學上其手術如何？有無絕對足資證明之成績，是均吾人之所欲週知者也。</p>
<p>中國社會對於男變女，女變男，及雄雞生蛋，雌雞化雄之怪聞孔多。去年尚有北方某小姐男之滑稽喜劇。但在醫案上，則絕無鐵證可稽。無己，其求諸籍乎！</p>
<p>在英國此種性際變　,統稱為「性還原」（Sex　Reyersal），其見諸典籍者計有多案，其最著者為：</p>
<p>一一九三〇年，所爾　地方　Shorcbam　Sussex)一嬰孩，當出生時，向　應作為女性注册，後經醫生審查，恢復男性。</p>
<p>二一九三二年，曼遮斯德（Manchester)女子芳年二十九，施行手術，復變男性。</p>
<p>三一九三四年，非孚賽爾（Fifeshire)十五歲女子，同樣變復男性。</p>
<p>一九三五年特萬（Devon)十歲男孩，同樣復變女性。</p>
<p>五四年前，有二十二歲女子，發覺己身漸變男性，鬍髭日見蔓延，乃赴倫敦查令克羅士醫院（C　ariog　Cross　Hrost　r)求治。該院外科主任醫師波氏（L.R.Brost　r)為之割去醫臓中一種腺體名（Adreua　　Oreston.者，旋即恢復女性體態。</p>
<p>六　查令克羅士醫院統計，該院前後共己改變二十五人以上之為態婦女，使成男性，均有詳細紀錄，足資參考。</p>
<p>七最近一　傳社會之女　男案，尤堪注意。緣有阿里斯敦（Oreston,near　Plymcnth)女運動家牛氏（Mar　Edith　Lonise　Wcston者，自幼即體格雄偉出眾，有男士　度，一九二四年奪得全英女子　　　　，　　　　　　凡六年之久，一九二七年又　得全英女子鐵槍錦標，　聲社會。在未得名以前曾在服裝店中工作，又曾學習看護，及按摩術，得有按摩畢業文憑，營業多年，生意尚佳後因偶爾加入女子體育會而發覺其體育天才，於是名震三島。一九二八年赴巴拉克（Plagne)參加國際競技大會時，始對於本身之屬性，發生疑問，經過多次遲疑，復　醫學專家請教，終乃決定受施手術。其施受手術之地點仍在為上述之查令克羅士醫院，　　後施行手術兩次，由主任醫師出具正式證　始恢復其男性生活。據其自述，三十年脂粉生活，真如一夢，昔之塗脂（但從來未塗口紅）抹粉，剃腋毛，燙髮，麗服，絲襪，高跟鞋，今己仍携手接吻，蓋形親愛而己，又稱此後將易名為Mark　Weston不復參加任何運動競　云。</p>
<p>至於他國之性還原事實亦有兩項著稱於世。</p>
<p>一一九三一年，丹麥某加術家變為女性，此案在可倫哈珍（Copenhagen)地方政府存有正式紀錄。</p>
<p>二數月前，一捷克斯拉夫女子堪氏(Miss　Konbek）復變為男。查堪氏小組為有名之體育家，曾於一九三四年參藝白城（White　Cily）之國際運動大會，造成全世界八百公尺賽跑新紀錄。經過多次手術後，頓改舊觀。但堪此項世界紀錄，不知將如何解決，其凖作體先生之紀錄乎？抑作堪小組之紀錄乎？質諸育專家恐亦不易下一斷語也。</p>
<p>以上云云，均屬實例，要之第一，體育專長之女子，有改變男性之可能，而藝術專長之男子亦有若干改變女性之可能性存在，蓋諸內而後形諸外，變諸內而後成諸外也。第二女子生殖器官有某一部分與男子性器官相等，故女變男易，反之男變性器官並不包含為女子性器官之退化摸型，故男變女難。此有常例，視上述各例，益覺可信。或謂由此以雙方加以適宜的煆煉，經過相當之時期後，再用醫藥手術以矯正之，或可成功。是語也，頗覺滑稽，未審醫藥專家之高見，為以何如。</p>
<h3>黄主席的夫人</h3>
<p>我在南寗的時候，在馬路上走走，看見一位年約四十餘歲的女子，穿着花布的衫褲，也不施粉，也不着裙，黄黄的一個面孔，十足像一個鄉下婦女，又好似一個娘姨！騎着脚踏車，車首掛着一個籃子，籃子裏裝蔬菜魚肉之類，在馬路上風馳電掣而過，那種騎車的姿勢，飄逸自然，一望是一個老手，行路人看見都輕微的一笑，我一打聽才知這位騎車買菜的婦女，却就是廣西省主席黄旭初氏的太太。</p>
<p>這位黄太太和黄主席據說感情很好，每日主席出門。太太都親送到門口，自己開門，自己關門，逢着什麼大典，太太也陪着出席，也是穿着他平日的衣服，就是逢到國際上交際，最多穿上一件長衣。</p>
<p>現在南寗市上婦女騎脚踏車的一天多似一天，而婦女衣着的簡單樸實，黄太太給的影響實在不小。（風信）</p>
<p>本報特寫</p>
<h3>王孝英女士談婦女解放</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>中國女子中學校長王孝英女士，在女人界有相當聲譽，她出身於北京女子高師，（即今北平女師大）從民國十二年到現在，一向辦理中等教育，雖一度在交湧部籌辦職工教育，並任立法委員，但為時較　，她還是以教育為終身的專業。在非常時期中的中國，婦女教育，是何等重大的問題，我們應不　求詳的多方探討，因此請她發表意見，那天王女士對於婦女問題也講了許多話，這裏把安拉雜寫來：</p>
<p>「婦女回家庭去」的呼聲，高唱入雲，分析他們所持的理由，例如一中國失業的人太多，二要注重兒童的教養三指摘過去婦女運動的失敗；四減去男子內顧之　。這些不成為理由的問題，我可加以解釋，譬如第一點，失業誠然是很嚴重的事，但中國婦女　業尚在萌芽，所佔的位置極有限，男子失業最大的原因，在於國際經　勢力的壓迫，政治的不安定與農村破產的結果，要說婦女侵佔男子們的地位，不能作為理由的。第二點，兒童教育己漸普及，兒童整天在校，不過早晚在家，母親縱然在外服務，早晚仍負教養之責，時間並不衝突。第三點，凡一制度的改變，利弊本屬難免，不止婦女解放發生流弊，即任何革命，誰能擔保百利而無一弊？我以為只能歸咎於政策的錯誤，辦法不澈底，或教育不普及，非婦女本身的罪過，而因　廢食，尤非所宜。至於第四點，現在小家庭制己極通行，事務並不繁瑣，毋須雙方費多少精神，男子在外服務，女人可分餘力為大眾盡職。過去的情形家庭經濟全由男子負責，但女子長此依賴男子供養，實是莫大的羞恥，倘女子只管家政，見聞有限，不知社會實際情形，故我主張女子不但為家庭盡天職，尤須為人類盡義務，要集合男女的心力，共同進取，以增加民族奮鬥的力量。」</p>
<p>「現代我國婦女，顯然分為都市與鄉村兩種不同的生活，都市中習於奢靡，鄉村裏皆能勤勞，大凡深入民間的人，總會相信這句話的。農村婦女真能苦幹，所負責任比男子還重，她們只知道女人是應該勞動的，非但不瞭解為什麼要這樣做？人生的意義，工作的代價，什麼也不明瞭。如其能以教育的方法，改善她們的生活，使大家覺悟過來，那我們婦女的力量，就很偉大了。另一方面，都市婦女如其偏於享樂，不顧內外的天職，不認識自己的地位，我倒有些擔　。有一次在龍華飛機場，許多時髦的女人，裝束入時，來看飛機的起落，馮庸先生便問我：「你看這班時髦女人，每天除裝飾遊樂以外，還做些什麼事？」真使人無詞以對。我想她們未必無智識的，也許曾受過中等或高等教育的吧，前者是只做而不懂得的人，後者是懂得而不肯做的人，應該調整一下　好。幸而在我國，農村婦女佔絕對多數，可以代表勞動精神的，在彼而不在此，所以要解放中國的婦女，應先從農村做起。」</p>
<p>「十餘年來，我曾主持過四個男女中學的校務，自愧無甚心得。在中學階段的女青年心地很純潔，富於情感，我向來以學生看作自己的弟妹，行政方面，亦以學生為主，教員為賓，凡於學生有益的事，便盡量的做，澈底的幹，決不敷衍；不該做的不做，做錯了對學生認錯，一切開誠佈公，無論何事，能由諒解而生信仰之心。我覺得辦理女學校比男校困難得多，事務也瑣碎得多，功課方面男生用功的便很用功，成績優劣相差很遠，而女生大都在一條水平線上，無高下顯著的差别，女子的體格還不甚强健。有時不勝繁重的課程，欠缺自動研究的精神，尤其在上海，因社會與家庭的環境關係，常使學校訓導感覺困難。我對於高中畢業的女生，絕對主張自謀生活，有經濟獨立的能力，萬不能存好高騖遠的意念。」</p>
<p>至此談話告一段落，王女士順手題下幾句，言簡意凡賅，正是她對於婦女解放運動的中心思想。</p>

<h3>證券　九六債又來漲風</h3>
<p>昨華商瞪券交易所雖經過兩日之休假後、時局方面、仍極沉悶、前方雖無接觸之確信、而後方預備、較前則益形繁忙、二中全會、會期已近、在會期之前後、當有一番極度震　不寧之空氣、故此時下手、　覺無把握、人心忐忑、市況浮沉、在所不免、惟停止還本付息之九六公　、忽又起毫無意　之漲風、市場謠言、　將提出二中全會、設思日金部份、至今尚毫無辦法、何來餘力及此、況七月底政府將付出各公　到期本息、約計七千萬、故九六更談不到、每次投機家捏造謠言、無不失敗、在此金融枯竭、內外多事之際、而忽來投機九六、其手段較前爲尤劣、昨日經過、上午交易極爲　散、場上大戶衹四號買進、餘則大都爲零星散戶所吸收、十一號及三十五號等則始終賣出、故兩盤上漲、計好三角至六角不等、九六爲四號五號三十五及七十七號買進、亦好半元以上、午後趨勢又轉、場上謠言又起、各　均形轉小、甲種猛跌五角半、九六因大戶現貨流出、欲漲無力、收盤各債、仍覺委頓、再小一二角左右、九六則多方拉招、亦衹勉好五分而已、市價結果、遠期丁種漲四角、餘則高低互見、　差於五分一角之間、九六則忽狂漲七角半之　成交總數、共計七百十萬元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>紗花　證券幫復來拉提　紗市漲風重熾</h3>
<p>各月一致跳起一元五六角</p>
<p>紗市趨堅、漲勢稍强、良以市場傳言孔繁、謂有流通券發行、於是人心震撼、掀起買風、市價緩步上昇、同時海外棉狀況良好、但空方鑒於倉庫之存紗、仍乏推動能力也、</p>
<p>標紗澄記大批購進　標紗前市開盤、因海外棉紗市情良好、浮定扒補、同時市場謠　紛紜、皆蜀利於多方、兼兼近日粉麥大漲、買者尤眾、澄記購買益旺、結果各月比上日收盤價漲八九角、午後開盤市氣仍挺拔、多數預料今日美棉看好、證券幫多頭仍來拉提、市價步步上昇、結果各月比上午收盤價漲六七八角、查賣出大豐一千○五十包、明德一千二百五十包、慶豐一千一百五十包、瑞大一千○五十包、愼記一千五百五十包、協成一千○五十包、恒昌八百五十包、恒德一千二百包、仁豐一千五百包、信誠二千○五十包、買進澄記六千六百包、振大八百五十包、豐泰一千八百包、元一八百包、泰昌一千五百五十包、新華五百包、長豐一千一百五十包、大　一千一百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>投機商注意新花　遠期棉獨漲四角</h3>
<p>棉市陳棉傾向下游、局勢甚挫、蓋以某方之多頭紛紛出範、大槪仍係粗絨棉尚無推銷辦法、惟新棉受外棉上漲之刺激而挺、但據一部分國內棉田多種、產額增加云、</p>
<p>標花陳跌新漲　標花前市開盤、各月一律上漲、因美印棉市穩固、多頭活動加碼、但陳棉異常虛弱因金融幫多頭出　、漲力缺乏、惟新棉投機商買進、結果本月底比上日收盤價跌五分、遠月漲四角半、午後開盤、澄記及證券幫仍購進、且買胃殊强、然陳花不振、新花堅俏、迨至三收盤、有一部分檔商因今年棉田增加、拋賣轉跌、結果陳花比上午收盤價跌二角半、新花勿動、查　出大孚二　六　　、通記七　八百担裕大九　九　担、　　　　四百担、　　二千六百担、恒德　千五百担、元一　千三百担、　　八千五百担、益康二千三百担、長和六千九百担、合興三千五百担、愼昌二千三百担、長豐四千五百担、同和二千担、買進澄記一萬三千二百担、明德二千担、振大七千八百担、豐泰七千一百担、愼記三千六百担、大昌成一千八百担、泰昌一千三百担、潤康二千八百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下</p>

<p>多頭了結</p>
<h3>美棉先漲後回</h3>
<p>印棉市價甚爲堅昂</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、各月漲三至八磅音、利物浦消息良好、同業及外商買進、現貨緊俏、同時紡織品需要活動、中部及東部棉區雖得雨水、仍不足阻止漲風、囤棉處在一角一分八　時、售出十月期一萬包於紐奧崙市場、據報囤棉處否認已將現棉售與某現貨商、並報有巴西棉一千包與美棉競售、其後同業遲疑不前、多頭了結、市況回小、計現貨漲一磅音、期貨漲一二磅音、英棉現貨漲十二點、期貨漲十三四點、印棉日商及期貨商買進而堅、計平果爾漲二·七五至三·五羅比、奧姆辣漲一·二五至二·二五羅比、白羅溪漲三·二五羅比、原電錄左、（二日電）</p>

<h3>粉麥期市均停</h3>
<p>俱爲追證未齊</p>
<p>麥亦期貨停市來拍、現貨交易、尚見穩俏、惟南市未有見交、衹　北行家、直接配廠、做開一萬餘包、市面又提二三分、開商郵麥四元三角七分、次三角三分、江北麥四元三角三分、丹陽麥四元三角、高資麥四元二角五六分、邵伯麥四元二角七分、揚州麥四元二角二分、瓜州麥四元二角一二分、　江麥四元二角二分、次二角、南京麥四元二角七分、淮安麥四元二角七分、崑山麥四元二角三分、次一角八分、常熟麥四元一角半、次三元九角八分、蓬萊麥四元一角、計一萬餘包、由福新辦去云、</p>
<p>麵粉雜　　交易所、因市面飛騰、追證問題、迄未解決、故上下兩市、均未開拍、此後開市、當看追證、能否舒齊、先決條件云、</p>
<p>昨日期粉停拍無市、聞現粉客幫、頗見活　、聞兵船老車現貨均開至三元一角、有交易所成單去抽、照加五分、雙馬粉三元零六分云、</p>
<p>油豆餅芝蔴等、昨日全部停市、因　所以小麥追證未齊、停市一天、以待各經紀人交解證金、油豆等隨被縴累停止交易云、</p>
<p>美國小麥、旱災無甚改善、加麥結果難料、引起恐慌、空頭遂大舉補進、農民國積不售、故套　稀少、倍乃脫公司估計冬麥產量爲五萬二千一百萬斛、春麥產量爲一萬三千二百萬斛、其餘估計於明日始克分曉、美國農業部估計全球滾存爲六萬二千五百萬斛、其中美國滾存爲一萬二千五百萬斛、按去年全球滾存爲八萬六千五百萬斛、其中美國滾存爲一萬五千二百萬斛、自明日起加麥價格變動限度定爲五分、</p>

<h3>薄稻北銷尚形暢旺</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各幫來源、共到二十餘號、貨共四千餘石、本街銷場略轉良好、包胃大連靑島兩幫共辦一千餘包、故形勢帶緊、市況挺秀、厚早粳價升起五分至角許、薄稻回好幾分、杜洋尖及陰變元堅定、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源不旺、約十餘號、市上各貨去胃因天時陰雨不常、胃納平常、市價白粳高料定立、中次略帶穩勢、白元薄稻價無上落、羊埠尖疲小三五分、其餘各貨與前市相仿、</p>
<h3>客秈去路稍見活動</h3>
<p>昨日客秈疲風已緩、各米轉居平定之局、因來源雖絡繹不絕、而數目尚不見旺、而市存市次各米自節後步跌以來、已經小去半元以上、內地與本街已稍稍問訊、而貨主爲成本關係、亦不願再度貶價、　故昨市去化略活、價亦回站、全市由內地辦去江西中次一千多包、其餘統爲本街去路、共計開出江西米五千五百四十五包、湘米二百五十包、甫台米二百四十包、行　均與前市相似云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　東洋疋頭迭漲不已</h3>
<p>連日棉布市情、受美棉及三品紗花猛漲影響、日商行廠心思大堅、聞前日東行開出本月份及八九月份期白貨一千餘件、連月秒及一日開出、總數已達三千餘件、以細布·細斜·兩檔爲最夥、行盤前日開出卽漲五分、昨日又加起五分、致市盤驟形提高、昨又再漲起二分半之譜、以染廠業進額最多、東貨內外廠老花新花直貢·嗶嘰·克羅綢·色丁·花布等花色布疋、聞亦有千餘件巨額開出、本街進額最巨、客銷北路天津幫進小額、本廠下擋淸水漂布·綫呢·輕重磅粗布·粗斜·售盤、以重磅貨較爲堅昂、烟台靑島幫僅進色素吡嘰各牌綫呢、數額甚微、南路兩廣最爲岑寂、川路重慶萬縣幫吸胃仍佳、本廠及內外廠出品色素嗶嘰·直貢及莊靑藍灰色斜紋、大成等廠藍布條漂布、均續見湧辦、雲南都亦漸起色、白貨需要已淡、而色貨色素直貢嗶嘰　紋呢藍布等貨、需要加旺、</p>
<h3>秋貨呢絨川幫已有問訊</h3>
<p>昨川幫駐滬申莊、如大川通·益記·太古渝·志昌祥·祥裕公·積福里·聚元坊·協記　·匯記　·等客方、對秋銷之西裝花呢·寬緊條素·駱駝絨·元直貢什素嗶嘰·海令蓬中厚嗶嘰等、均索取樣本、據聞正式交易尚須相當接洽、惟親歷年習慣、川貴雲南諸幫、因路途遙遠、添辦確較其他客幫爲早、故離動辦期諒亦不遠矣、</p>
<h3>絲茶　海外絲市一致傾跌</h3>
<p>昨日紐約生絲市況、頗不景氣、日絲華絲每磅俱跌三分、現期貨品售開、則較前日各跌一分、里昂絲市除日絲暨上海絲B字仍持原價外、上海絲A字及廣東絲各跌一法郎、橫濱絲市亦無好象、計現貨跌十三元、期貨跌九元、上海絲銷、因之簿頓、絲市淸瘦、用戶絲交亦少售開云、</p>

<p>人造絲昨　　　　　　　　　三　　　　有光三十　、俱一百十五元、不連稅、一百二十號天　牌、價跌數元、成交二十　箱、價四百零五元、某本街字號、向司尼換廠方、開進四百五十號、棧單五十箱、價八十元、昨日　意師　拍賣、貨共二箱、一爲三百號日貨、一爲一百五十號吐買孝富廠出品、價三百七十七元與三百七十三元、一百五十號天　牌無貨、</p>
<h3>意絲跌價傾銷　六月份歐絲輸美突增</h3>
<p>幾及往時四倍</p>
<p>昨據路透電、紐約生絲存銷統計、六月份美國生絲銷用數目大減、六月份銷用總數爲三萬一千四百三十八包、較上月減六百四十九包、較去年同月銳減二千包左右、而六月份歐洲絲輸美突增、爲年來所罕見、蓋因意大利絲受到制裁影響、不能銷與英法、乃跌價傾售於美、故輸美數目、幾及往時之四倍、同時華絲運美、則因之減少二百五十七包、茲將各絲品在美市況、列表如下、</p>
<h3>紅茶銷出五萬四千餘箱</h3>
<p>本年紅茶、自開市以來、銷售非常迅速、至現時爲止、已銷出　門浮　至德紅茶四萬零五百箱、　州六千四百九十箱、　　花香七千六百六十七箱、共計銷出五萬四千餘箱、</p>

<p>新荔枝千　　　　·大朝枝·水東枝·海口枝、已到過三四批外、尚有　之早紅枝·烏萊枝、粵　　山　　　　　·　見貨、　　口　　　　　多、尚須緩日　開、以免行　　　、市勢均有　軟之象、</p>
<h3>廈橘餅新貨開盤</h3>
<p>廈橘餅前日所到二十桶、昨已見樣、貨品尚佳、惟色澤不勻、銷有參次、故號方欲升一元、勢有未能、當由買方折衷辦法、後批如有較高之貨到、尚可稍增、</p>
<h3>茴香尚在新陳不接</h3>
<p>茴香近以到存見缺、且出新期尚需月餘、故趨勢甚緊、查新海茴香開過二十九元、後尚無積開、昨市南寧貨　三十一元、北海貨三十元、均未成交、</p>
<h3>糖市　綿赤號盤漲五六角</h3>
<p>昨糖市如荷組白等趨勢仍平、惟國產赤砂因產價續緊、而銷路漸活、故號盤復漲、公會　盤二四粗砂白現貨二十二元一角、　口貨六元七角半、東白四八九號均　原價、惟現貨八號YT嘜以二十一元四角成交、本廠綿白亦乏上落、號盤有　　　開出國產赤砂一千八百包之　、計　幫開價大　　　利等　四百七十餘　、　　十三二　　　　　三元一·二·三角、又一·三元、又華光樹興合興等一百五十餘包、十二元六七角至十二元二角、比升五六角、廣湘幫開海南赤六百數十包、十一元七角、比升二角、又　安赤百餘包、十二元三角至五角、惠州赤二百餘包、十一元七角、惠州白百餘包、十七元三角、　化幫高京赤百餘包、十二元、又大　紛白六十餘包、十七元八角、</p>

<p>海口新樹膠、（卽橡皮套鞋原料）、首批會到數件、早經兌通、查現在雖非銷令、但市上異常軋缺、故開價絕未鬆軟、反趨堅升、昨開號方續到新樹膠十二件、貨品尚佳、當以五十六元半開通、比首市漲起三元半、</p>

<p>（淋病）除了不淸潔的性交，淋菌當然還有其他方面傳染開來，如小兒的淋病，大都因是而起。此外公共塲所的毛巾，染有淋菌，或淋病患者不知淸潔，無意之中使自己的手指沾有淋毒，轉輾傳佈，觸入他人的眼內，也會由淋菌的關係而發生淋毒性的膿漏眼。不過這種淋病的傳染，機會是很少的。</p>
<p>「急性淋病」——淋病依他的症狀分別起來，有急性淋病和慢性淋病兩種。急性淋病的症狀，大概在不淸潔性交後兩三天或四五天，男子的尿道口在小便時有癢痛和灼熱的感覺，陰莖常常勃起，晚上或有遺精，淸晨起來，外尿道口有少許粘液，並且浮腫發赤。但當這個時候，有的以為這是遺精太多的反應，有的以為性交時忍精不出，精液尚未流盡，所以會有這種現象。於是有的聽其自然，有的隱瞞不宣，希望它慢慢地或許會恢復原狀。（未完）</p>
<h3>白濁變症險惡</h3>
<p>— （前人）</p>
<p>絕嗣滅育之原因　特效根治之方法</p>
<p>白濁病理及其療法。本刊已一再詳加闡明之矣。茲更就白濁之變症。加以探討。俾便注意本問題者。得有更明瞭之認識也。</p>
<p>白濁變症。類皆凶惡。輕則喪健絕嗣。重則殘廢致命。如後尿道炎之尿灼便數。畢丸炎之腫大疼痛。膀胱炎之高熱溺血。腎臓炎之腰痛炎腫。關節炎之骨痛殘廢。他若輸精管炎及攝護腺炎之閉精絕嗣中。子宮炎腹膜炎之危及生命。皆不可不治。不可不速治也。</p>
<p>向來醫藥界對於白濁療法。以注射黃色素為最效。但黃色素注射後。有引起炎症及其他副作用之流弊。歐美醫藥界一再冥心枯索。百計研究。始發明一種黃色素內服製劑Antirrhea譯名「安敵淋」。服之與注射黃色素有異曲同工之妙。而無其他一切之流弊。故歐美醫藥界一致推崇為最近唯一特效根治淋濁聖劑。余在臨床上亦迭用以治愈男子淋濁，女子淋濁性白帶，及因淋濁而引起之種種凶惡變症。有屢試屢騐之效。奏無上美滿之功。逈非一般祇在尿中殺菌之劣藥所得同日而語也。</p>
<h3>手淫遺精身虚體弱</h3>
<p>— 賈治中</p>
<p>遺精一症。大都由於手淫新喪及身虛體弱而起。患者精關鬆弛。威戟卽洩。故治法以固精為先。然如不培補其虧損。卽未足盡根治之能事。有復發之慮也。</p>
<p>患者倪君。少犯自凟惡癖。致罹遺精。迭經醫治。未獲根治。今春因遺精决數暴增。失眠健忘。病患百出。始自投余處求治。余詰悉其從前之治法。非偏於固。卽偏於補。卽嗎至太和藥房購服「生殖素」及「希米脫氏固精片」。服未兩盒。效騐卽顯。連服數盒。遺精早告斷根。身體迅復壯健。欣欣稱謝而去。</p>
<h3>尿中殺菌能療淋病歟？</h3>
<p>— 周笑涵醫師</p>
<p>在內服黃色素製劑「安敵淋」未發明之前。注射黃色素雖有引起炎症及色素沉着等副作用。但因當時尚無更勝于此之療法。故醫藥兩界不得不抱「蜀中無大將，廖化作先鋒」之主見，加以投用。自内服黄色素製劑「安敵淋」出現後。舍短取長。　精淘粕。用以內服。與注射黃色素有異曲同工之妙。而無其一切之流弊。一掃向日沉悶之難題。故歐美醫藥兩界奉「安敵淋」為根治白濁特效藥之權威。東西各國醫師咸賞用之。風行以還。救治急慢新舊頑痼淋濁惡症。不下百萬。</p>
<p>初。一般偏效療法。斤斤以「尿中殺菌」卽足盡治療淋濁之能事。其說至謬。其見可憐。夫以淋菌之凶惡。染入人體。無微不至。豈局部尿中殺菌。卽足自詡為有效療法歟。</p>
<p>「安敵淋」之特效。在于藥性純良。適各華人體質。服後藥力直達患處。深入病灶。舉凡淋菌踪跡所到之處。卽追踵而至。如貓捕鼠。如形投影。透膜殺菌。宛如水銀瀉地。無空不入。初不僅並具在尿中殺菌之功而已也。</p>
<p>又有多種廉價　樂。以檀香油等舊藥為主。或摻用覇藥。收毒入內。化急為慢。使病家見效於眼前。售其掩飾之毒計。貽誤病機。實非淺鮮。夫淋病險症紛岐。如　丸炎，攝護腺炎，腎盂炎，輸精管炎等等。盡屬內部纖巧組織。必焉藥力一一直達其患部。始克奏效。非若尿道炎及膀胱炎之憑藉尿中殺茵卽可盡其一部份之效也。</p>
<p>「安敵淋」之功能允貴在消炎退腫。防腐生新。鎮痙定疼。利尿净濁。初不僅透膜殺菌而已。故其净濁斷根澈底治療之功。為他藥所萬萬不及也。</p>
<h3>中風危急——在乎平日防治</h3>
<p>— 劉志民醫師</p>
<p>中風預兆。在于肢麻。肢麻病源。肇于骨病　中風之危。危在血管爆裂。病源基于動脈硬化</p>
<p>中風一症。非肥胖患者所獨有。特以肥胖者較易罹之。故人往往誤以為身不肥胖。坦然無虞。雖有種種預兆。亦恬不防治。一朝猝倒。手足無措。救治無從矣。</p>
<p>本症之來。其由也漸。肇其始源者有三。一：風濕威染。二：餘毒內蘊。三：身體衰弱。前二者常致血份不潔。尿酸過多。因而致動脈硬化。易罹中風。後者生殖腺素缺乏。血管失去營養。無從防止硬化。故本症治法。全在平。之防治。如臨時着急。極難救治。</p>
<p>患者起點。先感骨痛。繼成肢麻。終則動脈形成硬化。是故防治之法。治其骨痛肢麻。要為當務之急。而投服生殖腺素製劑。使血管常得其榮養。保持其彈性。亦刻不容緩。且生殖腺素有防止中毒及增加抵抗原力之功。故允為骨痛肢麻患者所切要也。</p>
<p>骨痛名藥「强斯登氏骨痛片」其所以能根治骨痛肢麻等症者。其功能不僅在乎去濕搜毒。且效在解酸去炎。消除尿酸。使排泄機能歸還正常也。如同時投服生殖腺製劑「生殖素」。則允有營養全身。柔和血管。增加原力。防止中毒之功。故凡明乎骨痛肢麻為中風之預兆。而欲求防治之者。是二藥洵為無上對症之要劑矣。</p>
<p>至于骨痛變症如筋絡抽攣。肌肉痠楚。半身不遂。全軀瘓癱。則允非投服「强斯登氏骨痛片」不為功矣。</p>
<p>性病講座</p>

<p>（一）性促性弱子嗣艱難</p>
<p>性神經衰弱一症。症狀不一。如遺精，夢洩，性促，性弱，腎痿等皆屬之。患者生殖腺衰頹。生殖腺素缺乏。性能薄弱。子嗣難期。對症治療。除禁慾攝生外。投藥自以生殖腺素製劑為最對症。非普通製劑所得同日而語也。</p>
<p>患者米君。秉賦柔弱。少卽多病。失於調理。無由復元。發育欠全。壯健難享。結婚後又為房勞所傷。以致性能頹廢。先後罹有性促腎痿等症。遷延失治。因循多年。結婚迄今。毫無生育。去冬始來就診。余除施行電療外。並對症發藥。囑向永安公司西藥部購服鐵盒新裝「生殖素」。治其性病。補其虧損。連服半打。病體旣調。再獲發育。生機重萌。子嗣有望。果焉上月米君來所道謝。云其夫人已欣告懷孕云。</p>
<p>（二）遺精夢洩精薄腦弱</p>
<p>遺精一症。靑年患者最多。病家來訴。十九罹之。療不得法。無由根治。一般見解。以為本症祇圖培補卽可見效。其實誤矣。要知本症病理。在於輸精管之鬆弛。治法首重固精。至於精苦枯薄。腦感病弱。則又非普通補劑所可奏效。蓋精薄腦弱之病源。胥在生殖腺衰頹及生殖腺素缺乏所致。對症治療。舍生殖腺素製劑更復何求。</p>
<p>患者柳君。少犯手淫。致罹遺洩。决數頻添。精元大耗。冷薄枯竭。腦失交榮。引起失眠健忘。頭暈目眩等症。迭服補劑。全無影饗。今春因結婚在卽。始由其至戚伴來求治。經余採用治補並進療法。囑向中英藥房購服「希米脫氏固精片」治共遺洩。服「生殖素」補精健腦。連服月許。遺精早愈。精足腦榮。身體發育。重享壯健云。</p>
<h3>花柳科戒烟科臨診述例</h3>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>熱水也得漲價了</h3>
<p>— 家為</p>
<p>是不久的事，上海的猪肉跟豆腐都相繼增過價了。誰都知道，猪肉之在中國是葷食中最普遍的一種食料；而豆腐，也正是歷來中國民間所最普通，賤價而又多滋養的素食料之一種。然而牠們都張賈了。牠們漲價的原因，猪肉為了求過於供，因為年來滬上猪肉的需要量日有增加，然猪肉出產地的供給，却因運輸與種種方面的不便而不敷所需，猪價因此漲了，所以，猪肉商也就只有實行漲價，以抵成本而簡接地削减需要方面的購買量。至於豆腐，誰都知道牠的原料是大豆，而這大豆的出產量，大都是在我們的東北諸省，然而四年多來，大豆的出產地早為敵人所佔，而這大宗的出品也就隨着給敵人作了種種軍需」的原料以作侵略的準備，所以對於我國各地大豆的供給，也就此問斷了；終於，豆腐商在同業的公議而罷市三天之後也漲上了價了。然而，牠們的漲價，却給一般人的日常生活上加重了一層負擔，允其是這在下層階級的勞苦大衆身上</p>
<p>但是，跟着猪肉與豆腐的漲價，據說俗稱「老虎灶」的售熱水業也實行漲價了。為的是上海「老虎灶」同業者的太多，而營業上的競爭是所難免了；所以今日在他們同業公會的籌劃之下，預備以劃一售價而漲價了。然這熱水的漲價却又得紛平民的生活負擔上加上了重量了，這是毫無疑義的。誰不知，水，跟着空氣，是人類生活上所一日不可缺少的資料。而「老虎灶」之在上海，於中下層階級日常的飲料上，是有着極密切的關係的。雖說在他們的交易上，多是五文與十文等極小的數目，但是這在一般人的生活上，所一日不可缺少的啊！允其是在今日這個炎熱的夏天裹。然而牠——熱水也得漲價了。</p>
<p>不過事情却使人焦慮的是—這些日常生活的必需品——猪肉，豆腐，熱水等—齣漲價，却正在今日這個民窮財盡而到處鬧着不安，恐慌與不景氣的社會狀態之下：一般的物價，正跟着外貨的充塞而陷入於無限制狀態的競賣之下，相繼暴跌下去；然而一般人民的購買力，却也跟失業？貧困，以至各種各樣的恐慌而一日繼一日的低落下去……所以，在這些日常飲食料的一再漲價，非但加緊了一般平民的生活上的壓迫，而且是直接與間接的加速若一般下層衆羣的不安與死亡。</p>
<p>然而誰能否認呢，有了某種原因，才會有某種結果，而這一個結果，也正是另一個結果的原因。我們要求生存，要謀改善，終得澈底的向着根原上去找的。</p>
<h3>風車</h3>
<p>— 王慈</p>
<p>臉是狹瘦得像一個文弱書生，居然也做了十二年的農夫的二叔，在薄暮里，闖進了我的家，他嘴里喊着：</p>
<p>『五官呀五官：』</p>
<p>我回過頭來，一個熟悉的面孔縈　着憂鬱：忽急，懊喪的姿態：</p>
<p>『二叔，出了什麽亂子吧？』</p>
<p>二叔把右手的食指打着圈兒，似乎在空中畫一張符似的！</p>
<p>「五官，那個，那個風車兄，有鬼！三天前，就像一塊鐵，動呀不動的…』</p>
<p>他望望我，彷彿對我有些怨恨，怨恨我不該慫恿他賣去了那頭牛，辦了這一個不服從的怪物：那麽龐大的一座風車。</p>
<p>『還是那頭牛，唉，我忘不了那頭怪忠心的牛呀，』</p>
<p>二叔恐慌的時候歡喜把左手的那隻食指彎曲了放在嘴里咬。嘴唇是動呀動的。要說話的時候，便把食指援出來：</p>
<p>『在前天，嵐車楞住的第一天，我想，那該是風兒微小的綠故—東南角上那棵大葉樹掩去了該吹過來的風，那時，我恨透了，唔唔，我恨透了。我喚了三弟，拿了鋸子，去把那棵大葉樹一下子便鋸了。可是，五官呀五官，那棵大葉樹被鋸了後，風車還是兀然不動，眞有鬼在搗着玩……</p>
<p>『田里的秧，呈露着枯萎的樣子，第二天，窪里的水便涸了。我看看那剛　好的十七畝秧，眞是傷心呀傷心！</p>
<p>『誰知道：我們等着那風車兒的轉動，直等到起了三更，風車兒還是不動，看看人家的，却虎虎地打着圈兒…我想，我的命不好，想起了那頭牛，那頭牛…</p>
<p>『今天一早，黃道士在路旁走過，他說：「土地老爺生了氣，該響動響動才好」，於是，午時我請他來，念了幾聲，便是五塊，黃道士說：「今天交着</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>申刻，風車便會動了。」五官　五官，你看，現在還是不動，鐵一樣的！』</p>
<p>二叔的手指着窗外—風車像交叉着的兩隻黑鷹，張着翅膀，動呀不動。</p>
<p>我拉起了那件短衫，往身上一披，站了起來。</p>
<p>『二叔，來！讓我去看看，』</p>
<p>在　茫的蒼色里，跟二叔踏上了田野的路，二叔的田里，已發生了許多乾涸的裂痕，二叔說：</p>
<p>『五官！你看：傷心呀傷心。』</p>
<p>走到那兒，二嬸坐在車軸上在灑淚，嘴里還咕嚕着：</p>
<p>『你不該賣去了那頭牛，那頭牛…』</p>
<p>看看風，風是習習地在吹，那風車的方向正向着西北，風是吹着正東風，我說：</p>
<p>『二叔，你把風車搬動一下子才對呀，』</p>
<p>『二叔你把蓬兒放下一些兒—』</p>
<p>二叔聽了話，同我把風車搬了一個方向，再把蓬放得斜了些，剎那間，坐在車輛上的二嬸翻了一個觔斗，跌在柴浜里：</p>
<p>『救命呀救命！』二嬸嚷着。</p>
<p>我把二嬸拖起來，二嬸的額角上已掛了紅；我笑着說：</p>
<p>『二嬸破了相的時候，風車便轉了下你看！』</p>
<p>二叔替二嬸抹去了額上的血跡。</p>
<p>我們三個兒都笑了起來。</p>
<p>兩隻交叉看翅勝的鷹，在黑夜里虎</p>
<p>虎地揮發着勁兒。</p>

<h3>貴州苗民生活鱗爪</h3>
<p>— 高卓</p>
<p>住所</p>
<p>苗民沒有城市，但他們却聚戶而居，組成了「苗寨」。寨的大小，由十幾戶以至幾百戶不等。他們的住屋的建築，一如漢人的農民，在山間或在平地築起瓦屋，或士牆的草屋，這便是他們的棲息之所。苗屋大都簡陋，但少數富裕的苗民，也自己築起十幾楹相聯的住屋。—貴州獨山縣有一個姓蒙的「土司」，（苗民的管轄者）他的往屋是築在一個土崗上，三面有山合抱，屋前有一條河水橫流而過，形式宛如歐洲中世紀的Castle。屋的四周圍以高牆，而內部却純粹摹仿漢人舊式富家的佈置，字畫書籍，琳瑯滿目，簡直一點兒「苗」味也沒有了。但據說也有極少數最落後的「生苗」仍舊蟄居在山洞裏。也有一部分苗民是與漢人雜居的。</p>
<p>苗民的村寨沒有城郭為保障，一遇匪盜的襲來，自然是很危臉的。但苗民却也有他們的防守的方法：每家都準備着武器，如大刀，槍，和牛角，一遇有事，卽吹角持兵蜂蛹而出。牛角的聲音最能及遠，十餘里外仿舊可以聽見，用角聲為遇難的信號呼求援救，與古時所用烽火具有同樣的效用。而這樣一來，往往使襲來的匪盜不敢多作留連。</p>
<p>作業</p>
<p>農業是苗氏的主要作業，同樣，也以土地的有無多少而决定生活的優越與痛苦。務農的苗民除耕種外，還從事於織布養蠶等輔業。製成的布和蠶綣，大都拿到城市裏來賣給漢人。責州的小的城市以及村鎭，商業不發達，關於交易，仍舊是限定隔若干日而舉行一次市集，以行「日中交易」；在這個市集裏，我們可以看到苗民擔負了他們的布，米，糧食，鷄蛋，柴……等來到市上出賣，同時又在市集裏買了他們缺少的日常生活的需用品及生產工具帶回去。但是，窮的苗民，他們沒有士地，不能產出需要的東西，於是，他便不得不出賣勞力了。這種苗民，一部分在別人的土地上耕作，以勞力去換取生活的需要，—這便是所謂「長年」的。一部分則到城市裏來，作漢人的僕傭，一部分封貴州東路鐵遠玉屏……等縣去作運石的脚夫，此外，還有作「炭坑夫」的。生活最特異的，要算渡水上生活的苗民們了。貴州東昆湖南，有之江，淸江等江，西南接廣西，有榕江，在這些地高的交通，須在水上以小木船為工具，貴州另一部分苗民就擔任了這些江上航程的「領航者」。</p>
<h3>夏天的恩物</h3>
<p>— 眞愛</p>
<p>這幾天，張先生常常和他的夫人爭吵，因為張先生實在煩悶極了！他時刻用手巾擦着汗，於是手巾發出酸臭的味道。小孩子都患着痱子，哭着喊痛。口渴了沒有東西喝，晚上又給蚊子蚊蟲咬得不能安睡。……</p>
<p>這一天，張先生的夫人從外面回來，手裏拿着一包東西，張先生打開一看，原來是：</p>
<p>五洲花露香水　一瓶</p>
<p>五洲爽身香粉　一聽</p>
<p>五洲菓子露　一瓶</p>
<p>五洲蚊香　一盒</p>
<p>有了這幾種東西，手巾上洒上花露水氣味芬芳，小孩子身上撲上爽身粉沒有痱子，冲飲菓子　味美止渴，燃點殺蚊香夜眠安適，從此以後張先生的精神寗靜，他除過讚美他的夫人以外，還說：</p>
<p>「五洲大藥房的這幾種出品，這是夏天的恩物呢。」</p>

<h3>Prospects for the Fifth Session of the Second Plenary of the Central Executive Committee</h3>
<p>— Gao</p>
<p>The Fifth Session of the Second Plenary of the Central Executive Committee has been decided by the 14th Standing Committee to be convened on July 10th and has been recorded and sent to all Central Committee members inside and outside Beijing by the Central Secretariat. It is expected that the number of attending members will exceed the legal number. Drawing on the wisdom of capable people, referring to the needs of the actual environment, this meeting must be able to have practical discussions on how to seek appropriate and adoptable steps for the current dangerous and shocking national crisis. The importance of its nature cannot be compared to ordinary routine meetings.</p>
<p>The central government's foreign policy had already been clearly decided and announced to the whole country during the Fifth National Congress. Its main points are: "We will never give up peace until the hope of peace is completely exhausted, and we will never lightly speak of sacrifice until the final moment of sacrifice arrives." The diplomatic situation has become more dangerous in the past six months. The authorities have had difficulty coping with it, and the people have become increasingly frustrated. Today, the question of whether peace has reached the point of hopelessness for us and whether sacrifice has reached the final moment is a question of national unity. However, this matter is of great importance and involves a great deal. We should have a thorough review and not make any arbitrary judgments. For example, the two Guangdongs' dispatch of troops north to save the country alone, although its slogans are not unjust, it is bound to cause inconsistencies in the overall policy. Under the current situation, gathering the talents, thoughts, resources, and weapons of the whole country to jointly deal with foreign countries is still not enough. How can we allow a situation of mutual infighting to undermine the survival of the nation? The central government, based on its spirit of internal and external tolerance, takes into account the two Guangdongs' advocacy of saving the country. Therefore, on the one hand, it tries its best to avoid a frontal conflict, and on the other hand, it resolutely decides to convene the Second Plenary of the Central Executive Committee, hoping to open up the current difficulties under a concentrated will. The authorities in the two Guangdongs said that there was no way to save the country, so they wanted to take independent action. Now that this meeting has been convened, they will certainly be happy to participate and jointly make major plans, and the crisis in Neijiang will not be difficult to eliminate invisibly.</p>
<p>Secondly, we believe that there are often gaps between the central government and the southwest. Once the situation fluctuates, villains will take advantage of the opportunity to engage in their skills of incitement, hoping to achieve their sinister plans of encroachment. The key is that both sides can understand the crux of this and treat each other with sincerity, then the enemy's plan will not succeed and the path to unity can be followed. This meeting will open up a grand scale, with central committee members from all regions gathered together. In terms of eliminating differences of opinion, there should be sufficient efforts. Central committee members from the southwest should come to the north together and not wait and see. Perhaps through a cup of wine and joy, old grudges can be eliminated in an instant, externally demonstrating a unified pace and internally expressing a sincere unity. The future of the country depends on it.</p>

<h3>The Legislative Yuan Passes Amendments to the Organization Law of the Ministry of Interior, Approves the Draft Compulsory Execution Act in Third Reading, and Passes Amendments to the National Funeral Law, Among Other Bills</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan convened its 66th meeting on the morning of the 3rd, with 64 members present, including Wu Shangying. Sun Ke, the President, and Liang Hancao, the Secretary-General, were on sick leave, and Chen Haicheng, the Secretary, stood in. The proposed amendments to the Internal Organization Law were passed following revisions proposed by the Legal System Committee. The key points of the amendments include removing the provisions regarding the Department of Health being under the Ministry of Interior, changing the Statistics Division to the Statistics Office, the Land Division to the Land Administration Division, increasing the number of staff, and raising the salaries of inspectors. In addition, the responsibilities of the Civil Affairs, Police Affairs, and Land Administration Divisions were significantly adjusted. Subsequently, the Compulsory Execution Act was deliberated. First, Fu Bingchang, the convener of the Civil Law Committee, reported on the drafting process, followed by a summary of the law's content. The main points of the law are as follows: Regarding civil compulsory execution, there is generally no need to restrict the debtor's personal freedom. Dai Chuanxian, a member of the Central Political Council, also advocated caution regarding detention. The Civil Law Committee conducted thorough and detailed research on this matter and unanimously agreed that, given the current state of the property registration system, debtors often conceal or dispose of their assets during compulsory execution, or attempt to flee, or engage in other behaviors that hinder the execution process. Even guarantors often deliberately allow debtors to escape. If these actions are not sanctioned, it would significantly impede the purpose of compulsory execution. Therefore, referencing British legislation, it has been adopted in this law, and express provisions for detaining guarantors have been added. According to civil law, a mortgagee whose debt has reached the repayment date but has not been repaid may petition the court to sell the mortgaged property through auction. However, the Judicial Yuan's interpretation requires a final judgment for this type of mortgaged property auction. Because a judgment is required, appeals are possible, leading to prolonged delays in these mortgage cases, causing significant losses for mortgagees. As a result, the mortgage business has declined sharply, and the sluggishness of the real estate market and financial stagnation in Shanghai are affected by this situation. To facilitate finance and stimulate the market, the sale of mortgaged property only needs to be reviewed by the court and approved by a ruling. Although an appeal is possible against this ruling, compulsory execution is not suspended due to the appeal, in order to resolve these mortgage cases quickly. The law emphasizes the auction method for the price change of movable property that has been sealed, and the price change of immovable property that has been sealed adopts a combination of bidding methods, in order to be simple and concise. After the speech, the second reading began. Zhao Chen proposed changing the title to "Civil Compulsory Execution Law" because the case mainly regulates civil compulsory execution. Lin Bin said that the provisions of this law could also be applied to the forced payment of fines in criminal cases and advocated maintaining the original case. The majority agreed with Lin's proposal. The first chapter, General Provisions, and the second chapter, Execution on Movable Property, were passed in the second reading. The rest would be discussed in the afternoon. During the discussion of the General Provisions chapter, Zhao Chen proposed deleting the provision that "the order for compulsory execution should be signed by the president of the court." Luo Ding proposed deleting the provision that "if the debtor clearly shows signs of fleeing during civil proceedings, the court may detain him if it deems necessary to avoid difficulties in future execution, unless the debtor provides sufficient guarantee." Both were unanimously passed. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan convened a meeting at 3 PM on the 3rd and continued the second reading, passing the third chapter of the Compulsory Execution Act, Execution on Immovable Property; the fourth chapter, Execution on Other Property Rights; the fifth chapter, Execution on Claims for Delivery of Objects; the sixth chapter, Execution on Claims for Actions and Omissions; the seventh chapter, Execution of Provisional Attachment Dispositions; and the eighth chapter, Supplementary Provisions, in full, totaling 142 articles. After correcting the original text and deleting two articles, the entire draft was passed in the third reading after all omissions. Subsequently, other proposed bills were reviewed. The proposed amendments to the National Funeral Law were resolved to be passed following revisions proposed by the Legal System Committee. The National Funeral Cemetery Regulations were resolved to be amended and passed. The Regulations for the Prohibition of Electricity Theft and the Regulations for the Prohibition of Water Theft were resolved that the above two cases are passed after the review reports of the two committees of Civil Law and Criminal Law. Regarding theft, there are special provisions in the criminal law, and the two regulations are not necessary. The extension of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway contract was resolved to be passed according to the original plan. Later, other secret bills were reviewed before the meeting adjourned.

<h3>Extension of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Contract: The Legislative Yuan's Review Results Are Satisfactory</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) When Legislative Yuan member Yang Gongda reviewed the proposed extension of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway contract at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 3rd, he gave a detailed report. Mr. Yang stated that the case is an annex to the Sino-French Vietnamese commercial contract, signed in 1903. This contract for continued construction is already an improvement over the original plan. Among them, the determination of land prices for certain locations along the road, the calculation of freight in Customs Gold Units, the company's allocation of funds to subsidize the training of Chinese railway personnel, and the addition of Chinese consultants to the company are all beneficial to our country. Although the expectations of our people for the continued contract are not fully met, given the current international situation, obtaining this result seems acceptable.

The case was reopened this morning by British Consul Fisher-Maurice. Regarding the charge of the two soldiers murdering Sasaki, Mr. Fisher believed that there was insufficient evidence and announced that they would not be prosecuted. Hunt was also exempted from prosecution for inflicting bodily harm on Onishi. However, the case of Quine-Clark inflicting bodily harm on Onishi still needs to be heard and investigated. Mr. Fisher also stated that he would quickly conclude this case. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese Embassy authorities issued a statement at 4:30 PM on the 2nd regarding the decision not to prosecute the suspects in the Sasaki murder case: "Regarding the two suspect soldiers in the Sasaki murder case, the British court stated during the preliminary hearing today that they would not be prosecuted due to insufficient evidence. However, based on the numerous testimonies and evidence materials in the court, there is no doubt that a soldier from the British army committed the murder. Therefore, after requesting instructions from this province, the embassy will seriously negotiate with the British side." (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The British consular court opened at 10:30 this morning, and Judge Morris announced that the Sasaki murder case on May 26 would not be prosecuted due to insufficient evidence, but would only prosecute the violent incident at the Korean bar. As a result, Japanese listeners were very angry, and Japanese reporters left in protest. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the British consular court's decision not to prosecute the Sasaki murder case, Secretary Hanafusa visited Secretary Takanouchi at the British Embassy at 12:20 PM, stating that the Japanese side believes that the British consular court's decision cannot eliminate the suspicion of the British soldier murdering Sasaki and expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict. Therefore, they plan to resolve the matter through diplomatic negotiations in the future. They asked whether the British side had any preparations. Takanouchi replied that he was not in a position to criticize the consular court's decision. Regarding the continuation of diplomatic negotiations, if the Japanese side made a written request, he would telegraph his country for instructions before negotiating again. However, diplomatic negotiations cannot overturn the decision not to prosecute. Therefore, future negotiations will inevitably have considerable turbulence.

<p>(Nanjing) Zhu Hengbi, Yan Fuqing, Fu Wenshou, Niu Huisheng, and others of the Chinese Medical Association presented a petition to the Executive Yuan regarding the case of Liu Ruiheng, a member of the association, stating that before the case has been judged, newspapers in various places have often exaggerated their words.

<h3>Judicial Yuan Explains Two Doubts</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Judicial Yuan interprets that all machines and assets owned by a factory can be regarded as accessories of the factory. If the machines and assets in a factory belong to the same person as the factory, they are naturally accessories of the factory according to the provisions of Article 6, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Law. If a mortgage right is established on the factory, unless otherwise specified, the effect of the mortgage right naturally extends to the machines and assets according to the provisions of Article 862, Paragraph 1 of the same law. As for the establishment of the mortgage right, even if the machines and assets are not noted when applying for registration, it does not affect the scope of the mortgage right. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Judicial Yuan explains the doubts about property ownership registration. A mortgage right is a property right that guarantees creditor's rights and does not transfer possession according to law. The document states that the owner of the real estate has transferred possession of the real estate at the time of establishment, and it is clearly stated that if it is not redeemed upon expiration, it will be considered absolute. Although the establishment of this type of contract is not in accordance with the law, the mortgagee has clearly and continuously possessed it with the intention of ownership after the expiration of the agreed period, and the beginning of his possession was indeed in good faith and without negligence. If the calculation of the period of possession has been more than ten years, then according to the provisions of Article 7 of the Implementation Law of the Property Rights Chapter of the Civil Law, the possessor who meets the conditions of Article 770 of the Civil Law may request registration as the owner. As for the right of redemption without a fixed period, according to the provisions of Article 924 of the same law, the person with the right of redemption can only obtain ownership of the pawned property if it has not been redeemed for 30 years after the pawn. If this statutory period has not yet passed, the person with the right of redemption may not apply for registration of ownership, regardless of whether the pawnor is a deceased household.

<h3>The Ministry of Railways Rectifies the Police Affairs of Various Railways</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Railways believes that if railway police personnel serve in a certain area for too long, it is easy to develop bad habits of familiarity, collusion, and malfeasance. On the 3rd, it ordered various railway bureaus that the railway police affairs are outdated and decadent. It was originally planned to rectify the police affairs of all railways throughout the line.

<h3>The League of Nations Restores Its Authority: Should Resolutely Fulfill Its Covenant; Failure to Handle the Italo-Ethiopian Dispute Resulted from Poor Implementation of Sanctions; Should Not Hesitate to Use Force Against Aggressors; My Representative Gu Weijun Speaks to the General Assembly</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Gu Weijun, my country's representative to the League of Nations General Assembly, published an article in the Geneva Daily News today, stating that after the failure of the Italo-Ethiopian War sanctions, some advocated reorganizing the League of Nations and amending its covenant. In fact, amending the covenant is not only useless, but also dangerous. The failure of the League of Nations is not due to the uselessness of the covenant, but to the improper methods and strategies for implementing the covenant. When the Italo-Ethiopian dispute occurred, all countries failed to implement the sanctions methods stipulated in the covenant boldly, quickly, directly, decisively, and resolutely, so that the aggressors were able to take the opportunity to adopt countermeasures. Therefore, once an aggressor is identified in the future, all countries should quickly and jointly implement the economic sanctions of Article 16 of the covenant. If necessary, they should not hesitate to follow up with force. As for the different industrial and commercial situations in various countries, a committee can be organized to study the fastest and most effective methods. However, the most important point is still the determination and sacrifice of all countries for collective security. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Dr. Gu Weijun, China's chief representative in Geneva and ambassador to Paris, said in a speech at the League of Nations General Assembly yesterday that the League of Nations' recent failures were the natural result of the September 18th Incident. Dr. Gu recalled the September 18th Incident, saying that China felt the loss of the League of Nations' credibility and power most acutely. China firmly believes in the principles of construction made by the League of Nations, so it has always been committed to supporting the League of Nations with loyalty. China expresses its deep sympathy for one side of the current war. If China accepts the new collective resolution of the General Assembly today, it will accept it in the same spirit as implementing sanctions. However, this acceptance cannot impair the basic principles of the League of Nations' goals. The Chinese delegation believes that the failure of the League of Nations regarding sanctions is not due to the insufficiency and lack of strength of everything stipulated in the covenant. The reason is actually the poor policies and procedures adopted by the League of Nations in implementing sanctions. After all, sanctions were not implemented as a whole, but only partially and intermittently. In addition, there is no determination or lack of courage. We believe that its effect will be far better today. The Chinese delegation believes that only the collective security system can guarantee the maintenance of world peace and prevent the occurrence of military aggression. However, if all member states of the League of Nations are willing to trust collective security, then, as Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov said, they must uphold it in various ways, even resorting to force. Dr. Gu then refuted the general view that if military sanctions were implemented, the heavy burden would be borne entirely by the major powers, saying that the contribution of the powerful countries would naturally be greater than that of other countries, because the interests of these countries are more threatened and they enjoy more peaceful benefits than other countries. Dr. Gu concluded by saying that the effective organization and maintenance of peace do not apply to the principle of universality. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Trends in the League of Nations Assembly: Strong Atmosphere for Lifting Sanctions; Taittinger Explains France's Position; Emphasis on Strengthening the League of Nations Covenant</h3>
<p>(Geneva) At today's continuation of the League of Nations Assembly debate on sanctions, French Foreign Minister Taittinger stated France's position, saying that the League's recent setbacks were due to the failure to fully utilize the League of Nations Covenant's tools for collective action, not to the Covenant itself. Therefore, the French delegation does not wish to propose amendments to the Covenant but aims to strengthen its power. Taittinger also stated that countries should now more clearly understand what assistance can be expected from collective action. The next assembly should vote on precise interpretations of Articles 11 and 16 of the Covenant (both concerning sanctions). It is unreasonable to insist that the League of Nations Council must obtain unanimous agreement before implementing measures to deter aggression. These regulations should ordinarily be maintained, but when mediation efforts fail, the League of Nations Council should have the power to create various obstacles to war, regardless of the opposition of the countries involved. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly special meeting continued this morning at 10:30 AM. The first speaker was the representative of Portugal, Foreign Minister Mendes Leite, who stated that Portugal has made great sacrifices since implementing sanctions against Italy and is eager to lift them. He then discussed the issue of amending the League of Nations Covenant, saying that a major debate should be held during the regular session in September to allow the League of Nations to stand on a realistic footing. The representative of Spain, Foreign Minister de los Rios, followed, advocating for strengthening Article 16 of the Covenant and stating that the disarmament measures outlined in Article 8 must first be implemented, otherwise the sanctions measures stipulated in Article 16 cannot be fully effective. de los Rios' speech was translated into English and French by interpreters. Just as the translation was finished, a Czech journalist in the press gallery, Stepan Lauschmann, suddenly committed suicide (see separate dispatch for details). The Assembly adjourned for fifteen minutes. Upon reconvening, the representative of Cuba, Taillac, spoke first, advocating for the swift lifting of sanctions. The representative of Ecuador, Salton, then delivered a speech stating that continuing sanctions is futile, a point that Ecuador has already made clear. Regarding collective security, Ecuador hopes that regional mutual assistance agreements can be implemented in practice. The representative of Norway, Foreign Minister Koht, then declared that the League of Nations Covenant, especially Article 19, must be well utilized. (Note: Article 19 stipulates that the League of Nations Assembly may at any time ask member states to review treaties that are no longer applicable and consider international situations that could endanger world peace.)</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Taittinger then delivered a speech at 12:35 PM (see separate dispatch for details). After Taittinger's speech, Chairman Geilenkirchen, the Prime Minister of Belgium, presented two draft resolutions proposed by the Ethiopian Emperor yesterday (see separate dispatch). The Assembly adjourned until 3:30 PM. Additionally, British Foreign Secretary Eden, Turkish Foreign Minister Ruşdi, Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, French Foreign Minister Taittinger, and the representative of the Montreux Convention, Pengou, were scheduled to meet at 3:30 PM to discuss the situation of the Montreux Convention.

<h3>Abyssinian Question: Draft Resolution Proposed; Vague Wording Avoids Offending Italy</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Regarding the entire Abyssinian question, the representatives of France and Argentina have jointly drafted a resolution to be submitted to the League of Nations Assembly, so that the Assembly can appoint a special committee to review it. This draft resolution uses very vague language regarding Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, stating that although the League of Nations has not achieved anything in handling the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, the principles contained in the Covenant have not been changed as a result. At the same time, the declaration made by the American countries on August 3, 1932, which does not recognize the use of force to resolve territorial issues, should also be reaffirmed. In addition, it is recommended that the future of the Covenant and the League of Nations be discussed. All words that could offend Italy are avoided. It is generally believed that this draft resolution will be jointly submitted to the Assembly this afternoon by a majority of national representatives, especially the representatives of France and Argentina, to show that the representatives of those countries have reached agreement on the content of the draft and can also take into account the main points of the speeches made by the national representatives in recent days. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly will organize a special drafting committee tomorrow to formulate a draft resolution for submission to the Assembly for discussion and voting. According to League of Nations sources, the content of this draft resolution will take into account the essential points of the draft resolutions proposed by the national delegations, especially those extracted from the French proposal. It is reported that the French proposal advocates for the establishment of a special committee to study the issue of amending the League of Nations Covenant and to prepare a report to be submitted to the League of Nations Assembly's regular session in September for discussion. Article 16 of the Covenant, the clause on sanctions, should be maintained. However, sanctions will no longer be implemented universally by all member states but will be limited to regions. In addition to financial and economic sanctions, military action should also be taken. French Foreign Minister Taittinger submitted this proposal to Assembly Chairman Geilenkirchen, the Prime Minister of Belgium, for review today. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Ethiopian Emperor Asks League of Nations for Financial Aid; Requests a Loan of Ten Million Pounds to Continue Resistance; Also Asks for a Declaration of Non-Recognition of Italy's Annexation of Abyssinia; Transferred to the Assembly Presidium for Consideration</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The delegation of Ethiopia has submitted two draft resolutions to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, requesting that they be submitted to the League of Nations Assembly for a vote. One states, "The Assembly hereby declares that it remains steadfast in its adherence to Articles 10 and 16 of the Covenant and solemnly declares that it will never recognize territory annexed by force." The second states, "The Assembly is willing to assist Ethiopia in accordance with the provisions of Article 16 of the Covenant so as to defend its territorial integrity and political independence. It is hereby resolved to recommend to the governments of the member states that they guarantee a public bond of ten million pounds to be raised by Ethiopia. The terms of this bond shall be formulated by the League of Nations Council in consultation with the League of Nations Financial Committee." In addition, the Ethiopian delegation sent a note to Avenol, stating, "Our Emperor has raised several questions with the countries participating in the Assembly. To date, only a few countries have responded. Under these tragic circumstances, it is essential that all countries speak frankly and take responsibility with a faithful attitude to express their position." (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is reported that the Sanctions Adjustment Committee will ask to be dissolved between the 10th and 15th of this month. At the same time, the Ethiopian delegation's request for the League of Nations to provide a loan of ten million pounds and its declaration of non-recognition of Italy's annexation of Ethiopia have been transferred to the Assembly Presidium for consideration. The League of Nations authorities may try to persuade the Ethiopian delegation to withdraw this request. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Another Unfortunate Incident at the Venue: Czech Journalist Commits Suicide by Gunshot; Bullet Hits Chest, Life Not Yet in Danger; German Treatment of Jews Arouses World Attention</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly special meeting continued this morning at 10:30 AM. At 11:35 AM, in the press gallery, Stepan Lauschmann, a photographer for the "Prager Tagblatt", committed suicide with a pistol. He shot himself in the chest, causing great chaos. Assembly Chairman Geilenkirchen, the Prime Minister of Belgium, immediately announced a fifteen-minute recess and declared after the resumption of the meeting that the unfortunate incident that had occurred was not directly or indirectly related to the issues being discussed by the Assembly. Journalists at the scene also said that Lauschmann had a history of mental instability. A suicide note was found in his bag, addressed separately to King Edward VIII of England, The Times of London, The Manchester Guardian, and League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol. The letter to Avenol stated that he was sorry that this action would cause disruption. It also said that he was a Jew, born in Vienna, later naturalized as a Czech citizen. He decided to commit suicide because of the poor treatment of Jews in Germany, hoping to arouse the attention of people around the world with his death. After being shot, the bullet was still near Lauschmann's heart. Doctors used X-rays to examine him, and the heart was not injured. It is said that his life is not yet in danger. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Proceedings of the Meeting the Day Before Yesterday: Representatives of Various Countries Deliver Speeches in Succession</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly continued its meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from Chile (Rivas Vicuña), Sweden (Westerman, Minister to Switzerland), the Irish Free State (de Valera, President of the Executive Council), New Zealand (Sir James Parr, High Commissioner to the United Kingdom), Austria (Frougèl), China (Dr. Wellington Koo, Ambassador to France), Hungary (Teleki), and Iran (Sépahbodi) delivered speeches in succession. They all stated that the sanctions front against Italy had broken down and that all sanctions measures should be lifted. They all advocated that the current system of the League of Nations should be reconsidered during the regular session of the Assembly in September. Among them, Sir James Parr of New Zealand expressed similar views to those expressed by de Wet of the Union of South Africa yesterday, stating that although he still advocated that the current sanctions measures should be maintained or even strengthened, since most member states now agree to lift them, New Zealand will follow the majority.</p>
<p>Austrian representative Frougèl said that the memorandum submitted by Italy to the League of Nations a few days ago was conciliatory in tone and that a final resolution of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute could be achieved. Austria expressed optimism about the future situation.</p>
<p>Chinese representative Wellington Koo spoke next (see separate dispatch for the speech). Iranian representative Sépahbodi then expressed his opinion, stating that after the League of Nations Covenant is amended, the League's position may be weakened, and this must be prevented. In his country's view, the strength of the League of Nations is based on the unity of all small countries.</p>
<p>After the representatives of various countries finished their speeches, it was already 6:00 PM, and the meeting was adjourned. It is now reported that the League of Nations Assembly will conclude its work tomorrow (the 3rd) or the morning after tomorrow. As soon as the Assembly closes, the Sanctions Adjustment Committee will convene on Saturday afternoon this week to decide on the procedure for lifting sanctions. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Although the smaller countries previously did their utmost to oppose the lifting of sanctions against Italy, they have now acknowledged the inevitability of this action at today's League of Nations Assembly meeting in light of changes in the overall situation. They are now all paying attention to the immediate and thorough amendment of the League of Nations Covenant, but their opinions are not yet consistent regarding the procedures to be taken.</p>
<p>Danish Foreign Minister Munch declared that he advocated for the improvement of the League of Nations movement, while amending the Covenant was not yet essential. New Zealand's High Commissioner to London, Sir James Parr, advocated that non-member states should be invited to participate in the League of Nations Assembly meeting in September. Dutch Foreign Minister de Graeff spoke in favor of amending the Covenant, saying that recent events have proven that if another case occurs, a more satisfactory result cannot be obtained.</p>
<p>Éamon de Valera, President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, suggested that the major powers should unite and make sacrifices so that the danger of war could be averted. The audience was very moved by this suggestion. de Valera said, "The League of Nations has abandoned a member that has been invaded, leaving it to fend for itself. We must acknowledge this with grief and pain. Those who belittled the League of Nations, saying that it would not succeed, have had their unfortunate predictions come true. No country is apparently prepared to risk causing a war that is about to shift to Europe. Europe is clearly the dangerous point, so people should urgently work to maintain peace in Europe. Issues such as changing the Covenant should be put aside for the time being." de Valera continued to urge countries to use the mechanisms provided by the Covenant to eliminate obvious injustices and to engage in territorial and other adjustments needed for the current situation. In other words, to eliminate the obvious causes of war. de Valera finally warned the Assembly to act quickly, lest it regret it later.</p>
<p>New Zealand's High Commissioner to London, Sir James Parr, also addressed the audience, saying that New Zealand advocated for maintaining sanctions against Italy and strengthening them.</p>
<p>This dispute will be temporarily resolved by a French resolution, which is currently being drafted. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<h3>League of Nations Council to Consider Danzig Dispute; Commissioner in Danzig Invited to Attend; Britain, France, and Poland Stand on Common Ground</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council held a closed-door meeting this afternoon and decided to hold a meeting on the Free City of Danzig issue on Saturday morning (July 4) and to invite the President of the Senate of the Free City, Greiser, to attend for consultation. Recently, Forster, the leader of the Nazi Party branch in the Free City, published an article criticizing the League of Nations High Commissioner, Lester, and advocating for the abolition of the High Commissioner position. Lester came here yesterday to lodge a complaint with the President of the Council, British Foreign Secretary Eden. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is reported that the League of Nations is planning to hold an emergency meeting to consider the Danzig dispute. Lester, the Commissioner in Danzig, has been specially invited to attend the meeting. Lester is very indignant about the way the Germans treat him, and Poland may be invited to mediate the dispute between him and the German government. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) Political circles in London do not believe that a Nazi Party violent coup will occur in the Free City of Danzig in the near future. Political circles believe that the Danzig issue has been jointly decided by Britain, France, and Poland in Geneva to stand on a common front. Under these circumstances, the German government seems certain to restrain the activities of the Nazi Party in the Free City. Another reason is that as Germany is about to respond to the British questionnaire, it is not the time to offend the countries of the Locarno Pact and force Britain and France to cooperate more closely. People here now believe that the German government will not take any action that could cause a diplomatic dispute before the closing of the World Games. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Italian Journalist Who Caused Trouble Expelled from Geneva; Two Others Released for Lack of Evidence; Still Allowed to Attend the Assembly as Observers</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Swiss Federal Department of Justice notified the League of Nations Secretariat that two of the ten Italian journalists arrested the day before yesterday, Magini, a reporter for the semi-official Stefani News Agency, and Farsite, a reporter for the Popolo d'Italia, have been released for lack of evidence of causing trouble. The Secretariat has decided to return their press passes to the two, allowing them to continue to attend the Assembly as observers. The remaining eight were expelled from the canton of Geneva yesterday and went to the town of Coppet in the canton of Vaud. Five of them have already departed for home, and the remaining three are scheduled to return home tomorrow. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Romanian Foreign Minister's Outburst Attacked by Italian Newspapers</h3>
<p>(Rome) Italian newspapers today vehemently attacked Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu, because it was reported that yesterday, when Italian journalists were shouting at the League of Nations venue, Titulescu pointed and shouted, "Expel these barbarians!" Some observers believe that since Romanian foreign policy is directed by Titulescu, who "insulted all of Italy," there is no chance for Italy and Romania to repair their old friendship. The semi-official Giornale d'Italia even said that the arrest of the Italian journalists was a deliberate attempt to hinder Italy's renewed cooperation with European countries. (Guomin, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Since the Ethiopian Emperor arrived in Geneva, he has been well received by the locals. Newspapers commented on this matter with fierce attacks. The semi-official Giornale d'Italia wrote, "Fanatical anti-fascists are now using the Ethiopian Emperor as a puppet to oppose Italy. From this point of view, the Italian army's hasty entry into Addis Ababa in early April to restore order and save European expatriates was superfluous." (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Continuing Sanctions Against Italy Deemed Useless by British Prime Minister; Says Personal Decisions Regarding Staying or Leaving Must Be Made by the Individual, Not by Anyone Else</h3>
<p>(London) At the centenary celebration banquet held by the London Conservative Party Association last night, Prime Minister Baldwin denied rumors that he would resign from his positions as Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader due to poor health and denied reports that his doctor had gone to Chequers to advise him to reduce his attendance in the House of Commons to a bare minimum. The Prime Minister said, "When I feel that I am unable to shoulder the heavy responsibility, I will naturally yield to someone more capable, but this matter must be decided by myself, not by anyone else." The Prime Minister decided to explain the reasons why the British government decided to advocate for the lifting of sanctions against Italy, saying that today has reached a point where continuing to exert pressure will lead to war. Once war breaks out in Europe, no one knows how far it will spread. If Britain must reimpose sanctions, then the people of the country must open their eyes and do so, and they must know that this action may lead to war. We will go to Geneva this autumn to consider the future of the League of Nations and to strive to maintain peace through collective security. Uniting France and Germany is our strongest desire. Without the cooperation of the two countries, peace in Europe cannot be maintained. The Prime Minister concluded, "If I follow the opinions of European countries and do my best to spare my country from war, then I will gladly be called a coward." The Prime Minister's spirits were clearly excellent when he returned to the House of Commons yesterday, and within a month, the Prime Minister may be able to leave London for a long rest, so that his usual health can be fully restored.

<h3>King Will Not Marry Before Coronation in May; Printers Fear Losses and Take Out Insurance; Premiums Suddenly Increase to Twenty-One Percent</h3>
<p>(London) Lloyd's of London has increased the premium for insuring that King Edward will not marry before his coronation next May from nine percent to twenty-one percent due to a sudden increase in the number of insured, especially printers. The printers printed prayer books and they have already changed the name of the late King George to Edward. If they have to print a new queen's name because of the wedding, their losses will be great, so they desperately need insurance. (Guomin, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Montreux Conference to Resume on the 6th; Sir Stanley Appointed as British Chief Delegate</h3>
<p>(London) Authorities announced today that the War Department has sent Sir Stanley, the President of the Board of Trade, to Montreux, Switzerland, to serve as the British chief delegate to the Dardanelles Straits Conference, replacing the Under-Secretary of State, the Earl of Stanhope. After returning to London, the Earl of Stanhope will take up his new position as Minister of Public Works. The Dardanelles Straits Conference is scheduled to resume on July 6. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Germany to Prepare a Reply to British Questionnaire</h3>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources, the German government has drafted a reply to the British questionnaire, and Hitler is now carefully studying it. If approved, the reply will be sent to London within the next week; otherwise, it will be delayed slightly for revisions. Observers here believe that Germany previously used the excuse that sanctions against Italy had not been lifted and that the French political situation was still unstable to delay its response. Now that the situation has clearly left no room for excuses, and the British government has repeatedly urged it to respond in earnest during debates in the House of Commons, Germany has no choice but to reply. These observers speculate that the content of the German reply will contain vague and evasive language on certain points to appease and may not be satisfactory. In any case, when the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact meet in Brussels, Belgium, on the 20th of this month, the German reply will be a major agenda item. If the content of the reply does contain some elements that can serve as a basis for negotiations, then Germany will be invited to participate in the second phase of the meeting of the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact. (Note: The first phase refers to inviting Italy to attend the meeting to jointly decide on the attitude towards Germany.) (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>France Strengthens Defensive Engineering Along the Border with Switzerland to Prevent Enemy Troops from Entering</h3>
<p>(Paris) France's eastern border with Switzerland has not been equipped with defensive works. Now that the international situation is changing rapidly, the open border is a cause for concern. The Senate's Army Committee has decided to conduct a thorough investigation into this issue. According to the committee, although the Maginot Line is located north of the Vaud Alps (this line of defense was completed during the tenure of the late Minister of War Maginot, hence the name Maginot Line), it is sufficient to prevent enemy troops from crossing the line. However, in the event of an emergency, enemy troops may bypass the Maginot Line, pass through Switzerland, and enter the country. The industrial centers of southeastern France, such as the cities of Lyon, Saint-Étienne, Annecy, and the Rhône Valley, may be vulnerable to attack. The committee is eager to find a way to remedy this situation to prevent any eventuality. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Passes the Third Reading of the Financial Bill</h3>
<p>(London) The House of Commons today passed the third reading of the Financial Bill. When Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain concluded the debate on the bill, he said that because the national defense program is accelerating, this budget will inevitably see a shortfall in the future, which can be predicted. The only question will be how large the shortfall is. A supplementary budget will be proposed soon to make up for the increased expenses. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Sino-German Trade Agreement: Japan Again Suspicious</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a report from Ambassador Mushanokoji in Germany to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 3rd, he frankly expressed his views to the authorities in charge of East Asia at the German Foreign Ministry on the 30th regarding the secret Sino-German trade agreement and the subtle relationship of Cambodian politics, and inquired about Germany's countermeasures. Regarding the content of the Sino-German secret agreement, if it involves the export of a large number of advanced German military weapons to China, then the German government's actions seem to contradict the Treaty of Versailles. Recently, in light of attempts to undermine friendly relations between Japan and Germany being openly carried out, he strongly stated that the German government should take a broad view and implement appropriate follow-up measures regarding the Sino-German agreement, requesting the German government to reflect. The German authorities strongly stated that they would not change their policy of friendly relations with Japan, and explained that the purpose of the Sino-German agreement was only to strengthen Sino-German trade relations and nothing else. They also stated that during actual implementation, they would strive to find a path suitable for the general political situation in East Asia. As for the details of the agreement and other matters, they agreed to exchange detailed information further in the future before the talks concluded. However, the Imperial Government believes that even if it is only a third country's trade actions with China, if the result is to cause political fluctuations in the East Asian region, it will not be tolerated in the future. It intends to express a stern attitude towards the countries responsible for efforts to stabilize East Asia. (3rd, Domei News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Invade Russian Territory; Japanese Ambassador Visits Russian Foreign Ministry to Negotiate; Demands Release of Arrested Soldiers</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Chita reports that at 3:00 PM on June 28th, four Japanese cavalrymen rode from the Manchuli area to the Soviet border and crossed three kilometers into Soviet territory. They were subsequently detained by Soviet border guards. Among the four were a junior officer and three soldiers, carrying four Japanese rifles, four horses, four swords, and two binoculars. (1st, TASS)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that Ambassador Ota to Russia met with the Soviet Russian Deputy Foreign Minister on the 1st regarding the incident of Japanese soldiers being arrested by Russian soldiers near Manchuli, lodged a protest, and demanded their release. It is said that the two had a dispute at the time regarding the Soviet-Manchurian border issue. (3rd, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Moscow) On July 1st, Japanese Ambassador Ota visited Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Karakhan and, on behalf of the Japanese government, demanded the prompt return of the four Japanese cavalrymen detained at Manchuli Station on June 28th. At the same time, Ota stated that the location where the Japanese cavalrymen were detained was indisputable and requested measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future.</p>
<p>Karakhan replied that according to the report he received from the Soviet consul at Manchuli Station, representatives of the Japanese military commander and "Manchukuo" diplomats had discussed the matter with him. In their explanations, they did not acknowledge that the location where the Japanese cavalrymen were detained was within Soviet territory, based on the 1911 Qiqihar Treaty. However, at the same time, the "Manchukuo" diplomatic representative stated that he was under the orders of the Foreign Minister, and the "Manchukuo" government did not recognize the Qiqihar Treaty. This formal declaration caused great surprise in Moscow, because when the "Manchukuo" government was established on March 12, 1932, the "Manchukuo" Foreign Minister had formally declared that "Manchukuo" would assume the responsibilities under past diplomatic treaties regarding the Manchurian portion of the responsibilities previously shouldered by China. The Qiqihar Treaty was a legal treaty signed by China and Russia on December 7, 1911, and had long been legally effective. Therefore, "Manchukuo" must be held responsible. In addition, it should be noted that Article 7 of the Sino-Soviet Beijing Treaty of May 31, 1924, and Article 3 of the Soviet-Manchurian Ningyang Treaty of September 20, 1924, specifically stipulated that both signatory countries must respect the existing boundaries without any changes. Therefore, even if the "Manchukuo" government was dissatisfied with the existing boundaries, it must abide by them pending legal reform.</p>
<p>Ota replied that the Qiqihar Treaty was not recognized by Manchukuo because the treaty had not been ratified.</p>
<p>Karakhan replied that the Qiqihar Treaty did not require ratification and therefore became effective upon signing. The implementation of the treaty and the responsibility of both parties to abide by it were confirmed by the exchange of documents between the Russian chargé d'affaires in Beijing and the Chinese Foreign Minister on December 16 and 20, 1911. Karakhan stated that since the facts were absolutely clear, he hoped that the Japanese government would use its influence over the "Manchukuo" government to make it fulfill its acknowledged obligations, respect the border, and prevent conflicts of the same nature from happening again in the future. Regarding Ota's request, Karakhan agreed to forward it to the relevant authorities for investigation of the incident of the Japanese cavalry crossing the border. (2nd, TASS)</p>
<h3>Russo-Japanese Fishing Conflict: Japanese Ships Detained for Trespassing in Russian Territorial Waters to Fish</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky reports that recently, due to the peak fishing season, Japanese fishing vessels have greatly increased their activities in Soviet territorial waters. Their fishing and crab-catching activities have even reached the Soviet coast, so the Soviet authorities have had to open fire to stop them.</p>
<p>On June 12, near the Tolik Purosni Bay on the east coast of Kamchatka, a Japanese sailboat with a crew of 12 was detained one and a half miles offshore. Another sailboat with a crew of 9 was detained 0.3 miles offshore. Both ships were fishing for cod. On June 27, another Japanese cod-fishing sailboat with a crew of 12 was detained very close to the shore of the Shevuschi Bay on the west coast of Kamchatka. On June 29, a Japanese crab-fishing sailboat with a crew of 9 was detained two miles offshore from the mouth of the Ober River. The captain of the ship did not acknowledge that he had entered Soviet territorial waters. The ship had set 200 nets near the Soviet coast, but when the Soviet authorities arrived, the nets were thrown into the sea in an attempt to destroy the evidence.</p>
<p>The Soviet authorities punished the captains of each ship for violating Soviet territorial waters and illegal fishing. (3rd, TASS)</p>

<h3>Severe Drought in US Northwest; 100,000 Farm Families Destitute</h3>

<h3>Japanese Actively Promoting Agriculture in Northeast China, Intending to Increase Production, Increasing Wheat Planting Area, Preparing for the Eve of War</h3>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Since the Japanese forcibly occupied our Northeast, they have been actively preparing everything every day, paying particular attention to wartime food and fodder. Therefore, they are most urgently advancing agricultural production and specially establishing agricultural expansion and improvement policies for the entire Northeast region based on the different climates and geological conditions of North and South Manchuria. They are investigating soybeans regarding the needs of Japan and Northeast China itself, and the situation in overseas markets in the future, in order to control cultivation, improve varieties, and improve cultivation methods, so as to increase the unit area and yield, and reduce production costs, in order to complete commercialization. For sorghum, millet, and corn, they are preparing for the future population increase in Japan and the Northeast, so that the food produced can be self-sufficient, and striving to increase the amount needed for livestock feed in Japan. For wheat, the main crop in North Manchuria, they will improve the common varieties and cultivation methods, vigorously guide its cultivation, and increase the planting area by 2.3 million *xiang* (a unit of area, approx. 6.7 hectares), aiming for an annual harvest of 20 million *shi* (a unit of volume, approx. 100 liters). The cotton planting area is set at 300,000 *xiang*, so that the annual output can reach 150 million *jin* (a unit of weight, approx. 0.5 kilograms). For tobacco, a five-year plan is in place to cultivate American yellow tobacco, and improve the drying method to improve its quality, in order to achieve an annual production of 5.4 million. For tussah silk, they will distribute good silkworm cocoons and improve breeding methods, aiming for an annual output of 20 billion cocoons. For sugar beets, the planting area in North Manchuria is about 12,500 *xiang*, which can produce 500 million *jin* of sugar beets, which can be made into granulated sugar, so as to achieve self-sufficiency. For fiber crops, the planting area of flax in South Manchuria was previously 18,500 *xiang*, with a production of 18,500 tons. Now, according to the required amount of flax, it is gradually increasing, so it is planned to set a future target of 200,000 *xiang*, in order to achieve the level of self-sufficiency. Perilla seeds, flax seeds, sesame seeds, castor seeds, and peanuts are oil crops other than soybeans. In the future, it is necessary to rationalize their cultivation and increase their production. The demand for *Yinzi* flowers (safflower) has also gradually increased in recent years. In the future, a production volume of 30,000 tons will be established to fully supply the needs of Japan. Fruits are special products of various places in South Manchuria. In the future, Jinzhou and Rehe and other places should improve their management to smooth agricultural economics. For vegetables, in addition to improving the varieties and cultivation methods, they will also improve the expansion and storage methods to establish the needs of all parties.</p>
<h3>A Certain Country's Warship on the Waters of Nan'ao Island; Fishermen, Greedy for Profit, Are Being Used by Them to Transport Smuggling Personnel Who Also Act as Detectives</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: After Chen Jitang announced his assumption of the post of Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group of the National Salvation Army, he immediately transferred the garrison troops in Chaozhou and Meizhou counties. The county governments of Chao'an and Fengshun counties were ordered to collect thirty to fifty porters whenever troops were transferred through their jurisdictions. The county governments then instructed the districts and townships to apportion the task. Now, as the early rice is about to be harvested, the rural laborers are already busy harvesting rice and transplanting seedlings. Then, an order to recruit porters arrives, and the people feel quite difficult. Moreover, Guangdong and Guangxi are advocating resistance against Japan and sending troops far away. Even if they can successfully march north along the way, the Guangdong coastline is 2,000 *li* (approx. 1,000 kilometers) long, with open doors and no adequate military facilities. Nan'ao Island in Chaozhou and Shantou, as well as Qinzhou, Lianzhou, Qiongzhou, and Yaihzou, have long been coveted by strong neighbors. Moreover, since the telegram was sent last winter, the Japanese side has protested to Guangdong Province three times. Recently, seven or eight warships of a certain country have appeared along the coast of Fujian and Guangdong, and often moored on the waters of Nan'ao Island. Fishing boats gather around the ships, selling tofu, vegetables, eggs, fresh fish, etc. to the ships as food. Fishing boats are also often hired to measure the depth of the water in various ports, or to land and photograph the terrain of important passes. The entire territory of Nan'ao Island, where there are no military garrisons and no facilities, has long been covered with the footprints of military officers of a certain country. Their plot to occupy Nan'ao Island and the coastal area of Chaozhou and Shantou is certainly not just a matter of one day. The fishermen who are being used have close relationships with the smuggling syndicate of a certain country on weekdays. It is said that each fishing boat can get a reward of five or ten yuan for carrying people of a certain country on excursions. Therefore, it is no wonder that as soon as strange ships enter the border of Guangdong, fishing boats flock to them like ants to carrion. The "sweet bait" policy of the people of a certain country has gradually been sold in the coastal area of Chaozhou and Shantou. Currently, many warships of a certain country are frequently traveling back and forth overseas in Shantou, seemingly intending to wait for an opportunity to act. It is said that the people of a certain country have established a smuggling syndicate in Shantou and Chaozhou, and the net profit earned is more than one million yuan. In addition, there are 48 newly opened business firms and foreign firms, which internally form six major companies. More than 300 people are specially responsible for armed escort, and they often escort goods to and from the inland of Chaozhou and Meizhou. Each person receives a monthly salary of 30 to 40 yuan. Some of them are demobilized soldiers who have received military training. They mix into the inland areas along with the private transportation personnel and also act as detectives, investigating, measuring, surveying, communicating, etc. They are divided into several groups, and in Shantou City, they are divided into six groups (the original Shantou Police District was divided into six districts). Each group establishes a company name. On the surface, there are two gambling houses, two opium dens, and four large dining halls, which are the surface businesses operated by the company. In fact, they attract traitors and ruffians as their secret meeting places. Since Guangdong Province announced its resistance against Japan, the actions of these people have become even busier than before. It is said that the scope of their investigation is as follows: the name, address, number of students, guns, subjects, and ideological tendencies of the organizers of schools that receive military training; wireless radio stations, whether military or commercial, their equipment, length and degree of radio waves, horsepower, address, and hosts; the number of garrison troops, their designations, whether they have been newly changed or expanded, the actual number of combat forces, the names of the responsible officers, and the system they belong to; the recent movements and the directions of air defense and anti-communism; the attitude of each army towards changing its designation; what parties and factions are secretly raising their heads to carry out mass activities; the people's observation of the government's resistance against Japan, what new actions and new ideas they have, and whether they are carrying out self-help activities. It is said that there are still many conspiracies, which have been searched by police detectives in a certain place, which shows one aspect of their spying on us.</p>
<h3>Nanjing City: The Situation of Handling Small Loans; Since Implementation, It Has Been Quite Effective; Now It Is Still Promoting Relief for Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>Nanjing Correspondence: Since Nanjing was established as the capital, the number of citizens has increased sharply. According to recent statistics, the number has exceeded one million. According to common sense, the increase in citizens and the prosperity of the market are gratifying phenomena. However, the capital is a political district, and there should be a certain number of needs for talent and labor. If the population increases excessively and the demand is not met, the unemployment problem will arise. Moreover, in recent years, the national economy has become increasingly depleted. Therefore, small farmers, industrialists, and businessmen in Nanjing City are also showing signs of fatigue. The impact not only hinders the prosperity of the market and prevents the revival of the countryside, but also has a great relationship with the hearts of the people in society. The Nanjing City Government, in view of this, raised funds to organize small loans as a fundamental relief. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. The details are described as follows:</p>
<p>Types of Loans</p>
<p>The types of loans are divided into three types: agriculture, industry, and commerce. The loan amount ranges from six yuan to two hundred yuan. If there is a real need for a loan of more than two hundred yuan, it should be submitted to the city government for approval in advance. The loan interest rate is set at 7% per month for loans of six yuan to twenty yuan, 8% for loans of twenty-one yuan to fifty yuan, 9% for loans of fifty-one yuan to one hundred yuan, and 10% for loans of one hundred and one yuan to two hundred yuan. That is, the smaller the loan, the lower the interest rate.</p>
<p>Repayment Methods</p>
<p>The repayment period should not exceed one year at most, and is divided into three types: fixed-term, current, and installment. Among them, the installment repayment method is the most convenient. For example, if you borrow ten yuan, you will repay two yuan of principal every month, and you will pay it off in five months. This method is easy and simple. The borrower can avoid affecting his business due to repayment, and the lending office can use this type of loan for general lending.</p>
<p>Loans for the Poor</p>
<p>In addition, in order to relieve the general poor and helpless citizens who have no money to make a living, the Nanjing City Government has specially organized a special loan for the poor in addition to the above-mentioned small loans. The loan amount for each household is limited to five yuan, which is repaid in five months without interest.</p>
<p>According to the previous lending situation in Nanjing City, let alone high-interest loans, even the interest rate of ordinary bank loans is higher than the interest rate of small lending offices. According to reports from borrowers from lending offices, they themselves had a loan of 200 yuan from a bank, with a monthly interest rate of 8%. A total of more than 22 yuan was deducted for prepaid interest, handling fees, stationery fees, etc. The loan amount was 200 yuan, but the actual amount received was only 178 yuan. Compared with the installment repayment of small loans, borrowing 200 yuan and paying only 11 yuan in interest per year is a world of difference. Therefore, this kind of small lending is truly a relief undertaking that is beneficial to the people.</p>
<p>Promotion Methods</p>
<p>Looking at the loan situation in Nanjing City for more than a year, it has indeed achieved considerable results in the relief of small industry and commerce. The Nanjing City Government has further promoted and generally relieved it. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Increasing Small Loan Funds: The original small loan fund in Nanjing City was 150,000 yuan. Since its implementation, people from all walks of life have been increasingly applying for loans due to the low interest and simple procedures. The original fund has become insufficient to cope with it. The Nanjing City Government has raised an additional fund of 50,000 yuan to provide general loans and extensive relief.</p>
<p>Expanding Agricultural Loans: Previously, small loans in Nanjing City were originally limited to industry and commerce, which was inevitably biased against farmers. Therefore, agricultural loans were expanded at the same time, and the types of small loans were expanded to agriculture, industry, and commerce. Now farmers have been applying for loans one after another, and the lending offices and township agency offices are overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Promoting Industrial and Commercial Production and Marketing Cooperatives: Small industry and commerce in Nanjing City are often not well-informed about the state of supply and demand, which sometimes leads to business failures. In order to make them know how to improve production, and know how to avoid supply and demand, the Small Loan Office in Nanjing City plans to promote the organization of the above-mentioned cooperatives and give them cooperative loans.</p>
<p>Promoting the Organization of Rickshaw Pullers Cooperative: There are about 9,000 rickshaws in Nanjing City, and no less than 10,000 people make a living by pulling rickshaws (those who pull rickshaws as a temporary side business are not included here). Among them, most of the rickshaws are rented from rickshaw shops, and very few are owned by the pullers themselves. The rickshaw shops profit from this. On average, each rickshaw is rented out for about 5 to 6 *jiao* per day. If a rickshaw puller can earn one yuan a day, then the rent paid is more than 50% of the daily profit. If a loan is given to provide relief, each rickshaw would cost about 60 yuan according to the market price. The rickshaw puller buys it with a loan and is given special convenience for repayment (such as repaying 2 *jiao* per day, 6 yuan per month, and 60 yuan can be repaid in ten months). After ten months, the rickshaw will be owned by the puller. In this way, the rickshaw puller is free from the exploitation of rickshaw shop rents, and it is not difficult to support his family and make savings for old age and disaster prevention by working hard all day long. Specifying the Scope of Agricultural Loans and Promoting Farmers' Sidelines: The main reason for the collapse of the rural economy is, of course, due to natural and man-made disasters, but farmers' production methods follow the same rules and do not know how to improve. They have no preparation at ordinary times, and once they encounter an accident, they are at a loss. In view of this, the Small Loan Office in Nanjing City plans to stipulate that all agricultural main businesses, such as plowing cattle, seeds, fertilizers, purchasing agricultural tools, and digging wells and building dikes, can be loaned, as well as promoting farmers to plant flowers, fruits, and vegetables, and raise pigs, chickens, ducks, fish, bees, silkworms, etc., to engage in more large-scale production sidelines in order to obtain loans for operation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Dismissal of Smuggling Station Chief</h3>
<p>The Wuxi Station staff colluded to cover up smuggling incidents. After verification by the Management Office, the police were sent to arrest the smuggling ringleader Wang Xingen and send him to Shanghai. The truth was revealed, and many people were implicated. The Director of the Vehicle Department, Xiao Weiguo, and the Chief of the Shanghai-Wuxi Section of the Vehicle Department, Wang Shulong, were sent to Wuxi to investigate and verify the facts. The station chief Li Guisheng and all related staff were dismissed, and Yu Shucheng, the current Deputy Station Chief of Suzhou, was transferred to Wuxi as Station Chief. Sun Chaodong, the former Station Chief of Kunshan, and Zhong Qi and Wang Jisheng were transferred to Wuxi as Deputy Station Chiefs. Xia Yugong was the Director of the Luggage Room, and Lou Buqing was the Acting Director of Goods Extraction. However, Shi Jintang and Zhou Bohuang, the former Deputy Station Chiefs, felt that they had not participated in smuggling work, and they were also dismissed for no reason. They were unwilling and specially went to Shanghai yesterday to appeal to the Vehicle Department and ask for clarification.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Forced to Commit Suicide</h3>
<p>Zhu Shaoqing, a resident of No. 23, Erxiatang, Nanmen Nei, Wuxi, is currently the general manager of Jiufeng Flour Mill. His son, Jiongsheng, also works at the mill. Jiongsheng's wife, Yao, is the daughter of Yao Zhuzhai, the owner of Yiyuan Wheat Village, Xia Tang, Qimen Wai, Suzhou. She is 21 years old and graduated from Jingzhi Women's Middle School in Wuxi. After marriage, the couple had a very good relationship. However, the parents-in-law were fierce and forced her to work hard all day long. If she did something wrong, she would be humiliated and scolded. Recently, Yao became ill due to fatigue and wanted to return to her mother's home to recuperate. Zhu Shaoqing and his wife not only did not agree, but also ridiculed her with sarcasm. Yao therefore had the idea of ​​abandoning the world, so she swallowed raw opium and committed suicide the night before. When she was discovered, she was sent to Puren Hospital for treatment. Because she took too much poison, it was too late to save her, and she died soon after. Afterwards, the Zhu family claimed to the outside world that it was a case of *nian sha* (a folk diagnosis), but the matter was learned by the woman's father, Yao Zhuzhai, who came to Wuxi yesterday to have serious negotiations with Zhu Shaoqing. It is not yet known how the matter will be resolved.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Measures for Adjusting Field Rent</h3>
<p>The field tax in Suzhou is the highest in Jiangnan. Due to repeated disputes recently, the county government has specifically scheduled a meeting of all landowners in the county on the 4th to discuss the methods of adjusting the field rent for the 25th year. The principles have been decided: For the rent collection procedures in Mudu, Guangyan, Hengjing, Hengdai, Chefang, Xiangcheng, Jiaozhi, Zhouzhuang, Weiting and other districts, the Farmers Bank is entrusted to set up agricultural warehouses to collect them on behalf of the county government, and it is scheduled to be set up and handled before the 10th of this month; The problem of urging rent collection is fundamentally abolished, and the system of rent-collection chiefs is abolished, using the *baojia* organization instead. In each district, the township head is to recommend a rent collection officer.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Suicide After Business Failure</h3>
<p>Shen Yide, a man from Beiwai, Jiangyin, who was over sixty years old, opened the Yihe Porcelain Shop. He suffered a setback in the past. After Shen Chong reopened in Da Longkou, he suffered losses of more than 30,000 yuan due to the market influence for many years. It closed down last September. Recently, he was sued by Taiji Village for owing more than 2,000 yuan. Shen could not cope with it, so he hanged himself one night. His wife found out early in the morning, but it was too late to save him.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Abolition of Firewood and Charcoal Tax Implemented</h3>
<p>The Jiangdu firewood and charcoal tax was collected at 1,740 yuan per year. It was previously listed under the head of miscellaneous taxes and abolished in batches. Now, the county government has received instructions from the Jiangsu Finance Department, ordering that the firewood and charcoal tax be stopped from July 1st, and the abolition should be implemented to lighten the burden on the people. Yesterday (1st), a special order was forwarded to the Firewood and Charcoal Industry Association, ordering all merchants to comply.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Establishment of Land Arbitration Association</h3>
<p>The Land Administration Bureau is handling land registration, and the rural areas are about to be completed. It is now continuing to handle the eight townships in the urban area. According to reports, the total amount of land in the county is 2,389,180 *mu* (a unit of area, approx. 0.067 hectares), which is an increase of 600,000 *mu* compared to before the land survey. However, the situation of land registration in the urban area is complicated, and the land price is also without standards. Therefore, the Land Administration Bureau hired local gentry to form a Land Arbitration Committee to solve everything. The association was established on the 2nd. What needs to be resolved urgently is the issue of land price quota. It is planned to divide the whole city into several districts. The highest land price is 5,000 yuan per *mu*, and the lowest is 1,000 yuan. After deliberation by the Arbitration Association, the highest land price in the city center was reduced from 5,000 yuan to 3,000 yuan per *mu*. Registration will begin in the near future.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Coastal Defense Against Flood Disaster</h3>
<p>The collapse situation near the Yao Port along the river in Tongyi has been fierce recently. Villagers have petitioned the party and government agencies to quickly implement the *baotan* project (protecting against collapse). The weather has been cool recently, which is a sign of flooding. The county government has ordered the Construction Bureau to make adequate preparations for flood control.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Shanfei (嵊匪, Bandits from Sheng County) Kidnapping and Murder</h3>
<p>Mojiashu Village, Fengshan Township, Yuyao, is about 25 *li* (approx. 12.5 kilometers) from the county seat. It is an important road to Shengxian, Xinchang, Shangyu and other counties. There are often bandits mixed in. There is a wealthy Shanghai businessman named Chai Yousheng who was the comprador of the Shanghai-Beijing Steamship Company, the Director of the Yingfeng Zhen Stamp Tax Bureau, and the manager of several other companies and banks. He has one wife and one concubine and two sons. In recent years, due to poor business management, he became tired and took his family back to his hometown. Unexpectedly, he attracted the covetousness of bandits. The night before, more than a dozen Shengxi bandits suddenly came, each holding a wooden shell gun, and broke into Chai's residence and kidnapped Chai. Because the villagers were not asleep due to the hot weather, the bandits chose several strong villagers, such as Zhang Y茂等, and forced them to carry Chai together. Zhang refused and was shot dead by the bandits. One other person tried to escape and was also shot in a vital part. On the way through Huangcun Village, Changdan Township, they knocked down Deputy Township Head Wang Xingsheng and villagers Huang Dehe and Huang Jintu. The county government sent a team to pursue them, but the bandits had already fled far away. Yesterday morning, four suspected bandits were captured in the Shipoqiao area and were being escorted for interrogation. The hostage, Chai Yousheng, has not yet escaped danger. After the incident, the bandits sent a blackmail letter to Chai's family, demanding 250,000 yuan, which can be described as extremely illegal. Five people were kidnapped and six were killed or injured in this case. County Magistrate Lin has strictly ordered his subordinates to pursue the bandits.</p>
<h3>Jiashan: Sisters-in-Law Drowned Together</h3>
<p>In Yangjiadou, near Hongjiatan Town, there is a kiln owner named Gu Jinheshang, who married Yang. Yang is from Lujiabang Village in the neighborhood. However, in recent years, the kiln industry has declined and there is no way to sell the goods, resulting in a difficult life. Yesterday, Yang had a quarrel with her husband over cutting clothes for her son's summer clothes. In a moment of resentment, she ran to the river in front of the door and jumped into the water. Her sister-in-law Gu Xiaomei caught a glimpse of it and also jumped into the river, hugging her sister-in-law tightly, trying to pull her ashore. Unexpectedly, the water was rapid and she was heavy, and she could not stand firmly, and they both died. Xiaomei had been betrothed to a certain family in Taozhuang, and the wedding was scheduled for October. After this incident occurred, the Qiantang (groom's family) learned about it and came to negotiate with Gu Jinheshang.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Cooperative Sugar Factory Will Be Closed Down</h3>
<p>The All-District Cooperative Sugar Factory has been established for several years. It increased its capital and expanded its equipment last year. Recently, due to poor squeezing and refining methods, poor raw material quality, imperfect machine management, and lack of working capital, it has been unable to start operations. The Construction Department sent personnel to investigate and found that the factory's losses have reached as much as 100,000 yuan, and it is difficult to maintain it. It is said that it will be temporarily closed down.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Central Supervisory Committee Member Mr. Tang Shaoyi Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday; President Jiang Specially Sent Mayor Wu as Representative to Welcome Him; Mr. Tang Made a Statement Hoping that There Would Be No Civil War; He Will Go to Nanjing in a Few Days and Then Go to Qingdao to Avoid the Summer Heat</h3>
<p>Central Supervisory Committee Member Tang Shaoyi, because he did not agree with the Guangdong-Guangxi faction's decision to make changes, brought his wife and daughter and a party of six people from Hong Kong on the *President Pierce*, a vessel owned by the Da Lai Company, on the 3rd, to Shanghai. The ship arrived in Shanghai at 11:30 yesterday morning, changed to a small boat, landed at the Jianghaiguan Pier at 12:00, and went directly to his private residence to rest. He will stay in Shanghai temporarily for a few days, and then go to Nanjing on a scheduled basis. Mr. Tang also made a statement on the current situation. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Special Boat for Welcome</p>
<p>The ship entered port at 10:00 a.m. and docked between the 11th and 12th buoys on the Yangshupu River surface at 11:30 a.m. First, Mayor Wu and others took a specially prepared custom's launch to welcome him at about 10:30 a.m. At the same time, the Municipal Public Security Bureau also sent a team led by Wei Jizhong, the captain of the Water Patrol, to protect him on a public security launch. After Mr. Tang exchanged greetings with the welcoming staff in the ship's secondary parlor, he changed to the *Jinghui* launch, landed at the Xinguang Pier, and drove to his son-in-law Zhu Changnian's residence on Fukaicheng Road to rest.</p>
<p>Welcoming Staff</p>
<p>Those who went to the ship to welcome him included, in addition to Mayor Wu, the representative of President Jiang, Central Committee member Hu Wencan, Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu, Wang Zhinan, the representative of Central Committee member Li Liejun, Su Liping, the representative of Municipal Public Security Bureau Chief Cai Jingjun, Municipal Government Secretary Tang Shixuan, Garrison Headquarters Chief of Staff Ouyang Ju, Tang Liu, Mr. Tang's eldest son, and Zhu Changnian, his eldest son-in-law and former Minister to Sweden, Tang Zhaoshi, secretary of the Jianghaiguan Supervisory Commissioner's Office, and more than 30 reporters from various newspapers.</p>
<p>His Demeanor Remains</p>
<p>Mr. Tang is 76 years old. Because he suffered from malaria last summer, it was delayed until recently before it was completely cured. When he arrived in Shanghai yesterday, he wore a gray-yellow gabardine gown, with a black ribbed woolen vest, tortoiseshell near-sighted glasses, and black ribbed woolen shoes, and held a cane. He spoke naturally. Although he had just recovered from an old illness, his spirit was still good and his demeanor remained.</p>
<p>Mr. Tang's Remarks</p>
<p>Mr. Tang met with reporters on the ship and made a statement, saying briefly that he had decided to come north to visit his children and had no other business. He has lived in Hong Kong for two years and has suffered from malaria for a long time. He has only recently recovered, so he is very ignorant of the situation in Guangdong and Guangxi. When Guangdong and Guangxi made changes, Chen Jitang invited him to Guangdong, but he declined. Regarding the current situation, Mr. Tang was unwilling to make any comments. He only said that he hoped that there would be no civil war and devastation of the area. He also said that he planned to go to Nanjing for a while and then go to Qingdao to avoid the summer heat.</p>

<h3>Bank Settlement Holiday Ends; Normal Business Resumes Yesterday; Cautious Lending and Strenuous Support for Agriculture and Industry; Plans to Organize a Large-Scale Industrial Banking Syndicate</h3>
<p>According to *Xin Sheng She*, Shanghai banks took a two-day holiday on July 1st and 2nd to handle the semi-annual settlement. Normal business resumed yesterday morning after the holiday ended. Each bank has not yet fully calculated its profit for the first half of the year due to the relationship between the branches. The Bankers' Association decided to publish it after each bank reported its profit. The Banking Joint Reserve Committee, the Banking Bill Exchange, and the Banking Bill Acceptance also resumed normal business yesterday. The *Xin Sheng She* reporter learned from the banking sector yesterday that since the implementation of the new monetary system policy, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank have been buying and selling foreign exchange without restrictions, striving to stabilize it, designating banknotes from the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank as legal tender, and centralizing issuance. At the same time, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications set up special savings departments to handle savings. Therefore, the business of each commercial bank is inevitably affected, so they have unanimously tightened up and, in view of the fact that deposits are the lifeblood of business, they have striven to absorb them. For various loans, they focus on industry and agriculture. Regarding agricultural loans, there have been organizations such as the China Agricultural Loan Syndicate and the Zhejiang Cocoon Collection Loan Syndicate. Although there have been Yongli Chemical Industry Loan Syndicate and Shenxin Factories 1, 2, 5, and 8 Syndicates for industrial loans, they are of a separate nature. Now each bank has planned to organize a large-scale industrial banking syndicate to support industrial development.</p>

<h3>Huaan Bank: Business Scaled Down Yesterday, Relocation to Save Expenses, Termination Still Pending Decision</h3>
<p>Huaan Commercial Savings Bank opened in July of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), operating commercial and savings businesses, and was considered to be developing well. Now, due to market conditions and declining business, the shareholders' meeting decided to relocate to 73 Ningbo Road on the 1st of the month to conduct business. A reporter from the Central News Agency learned of the circumstances as follows:</p>
<p>Establishment Process</p>
<p>The bank was initiated and organized by Hu Chunxiang, Zhang Danru, and others. Preparations began in the winter of the 21st year of the Republic (1932), and the shareholders' meeting was established in mid-May of the following year. Registration was approved by the Ministry of Finance, and a license was issued. It officially opened on July 4 of that year, collecting the full capital of 500,000 yuan in one go, operating both commercial and savings businesses. The chairman of the board was Yu Huanzheng, the managing directors were Li Zukui and Fang Su'an, the directors were Zhang Danru, Zhang Qinbo, Chen Zeqing, Hu Chunxiang, Lin Huibo, and Qin Cainan, and the supervisors were Jian Junyi, Sun Jieqing, and Xu Nianzhuang. Hu Chunxiang served as the general manager, assisted by Qiu Weiran and Chen Zhenjiu. In addition to the regular meetings of the board of directors, the chairman and general manager held monthly meetings to discuss business policies and provide mutual consultation, so the business was considered to be developing well.</p>
<p>Business Situation</p>
<p>According to the bank's year-end financial report for the first year, the total amount of deposits was approximately 1.3 million yuan, while various loans exceeded 1.3 million yuan. The savings department allocated 100,000 yuan of funds specifically for operation, with independent accounting. The total amount of various commissions also reached more than 130,000 yuan. In the past two years, due to the impact of the economic downturn, the loans made were not easily recovered. In particular, with the opening of the savings departments of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, general depositors withdrew their deposits and transferred them, resulting in stagnant funds. The board of directors decided on two principles: 1. Increase capital and expand; 2. Scale down operations, or terminate the business on its own. It was planned to convene a shareholders' meeting to discuss and decide, but it was adjourned due to insufficient attendance. It will be reconvened.</p>
<p>Relocation</p>
<p>The bank has found a smaller house during the bank holiday and moved in for business, in order to save expenses. The new address is 73 Ningbo Road (opposite Tongheli on the west side of Jiangxi Road). Yesterday was the end of the holiday, and business was started as usual at the new address. All deposits and savings will be paid with principal and interest. It is said that all deposits will be paid off, and there are still several hundred thousand yuan in loans that are being recovered. As for whether the business will be terminated, it will have to await the decision of the shareholders' meeting.</p>

<h3>The National Products Movement United Association organized Summer Vacation Student National Products Promotion Group, stipulating the Scope of Promotion and its Simple Rules.</h3>

The establishment of this association is a collaboration of various national products groups in Shanghai, with the promotion and guidance of national products consumption as its mission. Considering that at this time of severe national crisis and rampant smuggling, our student community should take advantage of the summer vacation to work hard to promote the national products movement in order to save this unprecedented economic difficulty. We advocate and guide, and show them the guidelines. We hope that the principals of each school leading the youth will use the proposed simple rules to briefly express the purpose, and respectfully ask you to notify each student before the vacation to practice what they advocate, mobilize the whole body, and proceed separately to the best of their ability.

The above situations can be reported by students to their school principals at any time, collected and submitted to the association, or reported directly to the association by students. (D) Communication: When communicating with the school during the vacation, each student should focus on the national products movement, and report the main points of what they see and hear at any time. In the future, the valuable reports from each school will be collected and submitted to the association. The association will select and reward them, and publish them. (E) Exhibition: Each school should hold a student national products movement achievement exhibition when school starts in the fall, displaying the service situation and the information obtained by the students in the national products movement during the vacation for observation.

<h3>American Officials and Civilians in Shanghai Celebrated National Day Today, Consul General Gauss Hosted Chinese and Foreign Officials, Military Parade Cancelled Due to Rain.</h3>
<p>Today is the 160th anniversary of the independence of the United States of America. American officials and civilians in Shanghai held a grand celebration. All agencies, companies, and commercial firms were closed to commemorate the day. However, the military parade and flag-raising ceremony originally scheduled to be held by the 4th Marine Regiment of the US Navy stationed in Shanghai at the Racecourse at 8:30 a.m. were cancelled due to the recent rain. Yesterday, Colonel Pallas, commander of the regiment, inspected the site and found that the standing water had not dried up, so he decided to cancel the event. The afternoon ball games will also depend on the weather. The unchanged part of the original celebration program includes the prayer service and musical performance by the US Marine Corps at the Paramount Theater on Jingan Temple Road at 10:00 a.m. From 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., US Consul General Gauss hosted a grand tea party at his consulate on the fifth floor of the Construction Building on Jiangxi Road to welcome Chinese and foreign officials. All members of the American Club held a luncheon at the club's clubhouse on Fuzhou Road. At 9:00 p.m., the Shanghai Columbia Club held a joint celebration banquet for officials and civilians, with various entertainment programs to add to the fun.</p>
<h3>International Balance of Payments, Market Rumors are Completely Untrue</h3>
<p>Huadong News Agency reports that rumors have been circulating in the market in this city recently that the financial authorities will issue 200 million yuan of customs gold units in the shortest possible time to balance the international balance of payments and control domestic industries. Real commodity trading has suddenly taken off, and people are extremely frightened. A reporter from Huadong News Agency inquired with semi-official economic circles yesterday. It is said that the market rumors are completely untrue. Since the implementation of the new currency policy, more than seven months have passed. Although the international balance of payments has a trade deficit of more than 100 million yuan, it has long been paid off month by month. Domestic industries have been increasing rapidly with the cooperation of the financial community. Production has also increased sharply, which is beneficial to the international balance of payments. It is expected that this year's cotton production will be a bumper harvest, and cotton cloth exports are expected to turn from a trade deficit to a trade surplus. In addition, there are many other local products and raw materials exported. Although this is not a truly good phenomenon, it is common in international affairs to export raw materials and import raw materials when our industry has not yet achieved self-sufficiency. It is expected that the total trade deficit by the end of this year will be less than 200 million yuan. One reason for this is the result of government management of currency, and the other is due to "smuggling". However, in any case, it is an ironclad fact that there is no need to issue circulation notes such as customs gold units in the shortest possible time.</p>

<h3>Endorsement of the Industrial Inspection Agreement, Consular Body to meet this week, all consuls advocate passage.</h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Shanghai Municipal Council's factory inspection case, since the board of directors of the Municipal Council passed the agreement on the implementation of the Factory Act in the Shanghai International Settlement on the 24th of last month, has not been officially signed and implemented due to the pending endorsement of the consular body. Yesterday, Mr. Lang, secretary of the consular body, told a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency that he had presented the draft agreement to the consuls of various countries. It is believed that the consular body meeting will be held within a week. According to news from the consular offices, the opinions of the consuls are generally the same, and they all advocate passage and endorsement.</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that the factory inspection draft agreement passed by the board of directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council on June 24 is expected to be considered by the consular body in the near future. Copies of the agreement have been sent to the consuls-general and consuls concerned, and it is hoped that it will be approved by the consular body meeting before the middle of this month, and then it will take effect.</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that it was learned yesterday that the factory inspection draft agreement for the Shanghai International Settlement will not be approved by the consular body within one or two weeks. Copies of the agreement have been sent to the consuls of various countries concerned, and the consuls exchanged views with each other last week. It is said that the consular body currently has no plans to convene a meeting to consider the agreement. Furthermore, the consular body does not need to hold a meeting to approve it. The consuls can approve or reject it in writing. According to the Municipal Council's Director-General Fessenden's negotiations with the Chinese authorities on this matter, the consular body had allowed it, and the general principles of the agreement were also approved by the consular body. It took five years to establish the draft agreement, which was approved by the board of directors of the Municipal Council a week ago. This is the first step, and the consular body must give it final approval before it can take effect.</p>

<h3>Second Special District Hygiene Laboratory Opening Ceremony: Establishment History and Organization Overview</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Second Special District Hygiene Laboratory's opening ceremony was held on July 1st, presided over by the French Ambassador to China, Mr. Na Zhiai. This laboratory is crucial for public health in Shanghai. Here is a detailed account of its establishment and organization:</p>
<p>Laboratory Interior</p>
<p>The Second Special District Public Welfare Fund was established in the 16th year of the Republic (1927) when Mr. Na Zhiai was the French Consul-General in Shanghai. This was because the Second Special District had many public welfare projects that needed to be undertaken. The foundation was created to ensure dedicated responsibility and proper funding. In less than ten years since its establishment, the foundation has built numerous projects, including hospitals and schools. The Hygiene Laboratory, now standing tall near Jin Shenfu Road and Guangci Hospital, is also solely operated by this fund. Previously, the Hygiene Laboratory of the Second Special District was small and located within the Health Bureau on Beile Road. Although inspection work was effective, the public health sector advanced daily, and the demand for chemical testing increased. The original laboratory became inadequate. Therefore, the Public Welfare Fund and the Health Bureau of the Second Special District jointly planned and constructed the new laboratory over a year. The new laboratory building has four floors, 147 Shanghai feet long and 48 Shanghai feet wide, surrounded by grass. The ground floor houses the animal room, sterilization room, cold storage room, material storage room, and garage. The remaining three floors have large glass windows on the north and south sides, providing ample light. The north wing of the first floor houses the clinical testing department, parasite and microorganism testing room, microorganism culture room, and serological testing room. The south side contains the director's office. The right wing is the vaccine production department, which manufactures vaccines for preventing cholera, typhoid, and other infectious diseases. This department includes seven rooms: sterilization room, culture room, seed culture room, incubator room, bottling room, sealing room, and washing room. The south of this wing is the secretariat. The north wing of the second floor houses the rabies vaccine department and the BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) vaccine department. The south side contains the rabies vaccine injection room and the vaccine department director's office. The north wing of the left side is the pathology department, which has a large room for storing pathological specimens. The south side is a grand library. The left wing of the third floor is the biochemical testing department, which handles water testing and clinical testing. It occupies five rooms. The distilled water production room is also located in this wing but is separated from the testing department. The south of this wing is the chemical storage room and the department director's office. The north wing of the right side is the food and poison testing department, occupying four rooms. The south of this wing is the director's office and the darkroom/balance room. This is a general overview of the location of each department in the laboratory. The laboratory began operations in January this year. The total number of monthly tests for microbiology, serology, and chemistry has significantly increased (January: 195, February: 236, March: 452, April: 884, May: 1021). This proves the laboratory's necessity. Cholera vaccine production has already begun. The rabies vaccine, BCG vaccine, and pathology departments are not yet in operation but are actively preparing and will open next year.</p>
<p>Work Outline</p>
<p>At the opening ceremony, Dr. J. Raynal, the director of the laboratory, gave a speech discussing the laboratory's work outline, significance, and hopes arising from its establishment. Here is a translation of the essential points: "The laboratory's work outline can be divided into four areas. First, to assist physicians' diagnoses with specialized techniques. Second, to provide free testing to aid the poor and sick in the Second Special District. Third, to manufacture vaccines and other biological products for use by the district, the health bureau, and medical professionals. Fourth, to assist in epidemic prevention and healthcare. These four points are paramount and include many issues, such as testing beverages and food, and other tests related to public health problems. As the number of tests increases, the problems will become clearer, and defense methods can be improved and made more effective... The laboratory's work is practical, as mentioned above. The Public Welfare Fund's construction is commendable. However, we hope that in the near future, in addition to this laboratory, we can establish a research institute dedicated to research work to supplement this laboratory. The French Consul-General and officials of the Public Welfare Fund have foreseen this, and the Shanghai Pasteur Institute should be realized soon."</p>
<p>Guest Signatures</p>
<p>Besides the French Ambassador, the French Consul-General, the Municipal Council, and the French-Chinese Board of Directors, the Chinese guests included philanthropist Lu Bohong, Bureau Chief Li Ting'an, Section Chief Wu Liguo, Director Sun Kuifang, Director Cheng Muyi, Director Chen Yonghan, researchers from the Lester Institute, and Aurora University President Hu Wenyao.

<h3>Wang Shengsan's Telegram: Speech at the World Power Conference</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Shengsan, President of the Shanghai Engineering Society, was sent to England by the Central Government to attend the World Power Conference. Mr. Wang arrived in London safely on June 15th and first conducted research. The conference officially opened on June 22nd, with representatives from 33 countries, totaling over 300 people. We have received a telegram from Mr. Wang stating that he was specially invited to speak at the conference on June 27th. Mr. Wang detailed the general situation of industry in our country, expressing his hope that engineers and industrialists from all countries would genuinely cooperate with our country to jointly develop industry, eliminate unnecessary wars, and seek the happiness of mankind. The audience greatly appreciated his speech and expressed their willingness to sincerely discuss and exchange opinions with Mr. Wang.</p>
<h3>Hygiene Laboratory Epidemic Prevention Work: Free Fecal Testing</h3>
<p>Cholera epidemics are a significant international issue. Preparations for bacterial diagnosis are necessary to distinguish cholera from ordinary diarrhea. Every summer, the Shanghai Municipal Hygiene Laboratory encourages hospitals to collect fecal samples from suspected cholera patients and send them for testing, free of charge. Now that it is hot, cholera outbreaks are inevitable. It is hoped that all epidemic hospitals and clinics will send fecal samples from suspected patients for testing, so that early detection and prevention measures can be taken to prevent its spread.</p>
<h3>New Road Construction Materials: Preferential Transportation Measures: Order from the Ministry Received by Two Railway Bureaus</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus received an instruction from the Ministry of Railways stating that the accounting office and the business department of the New Road Construction Committee of the Ministry had jointly submitted a report. The report stated that the Ministry's construction of the Jingqu, Chengyu, Chuanxiang, and Xiangqian new roads was actively underway. The number of workers, materials, instruments, and tools transported through existing railways was substantial. Therefore, it was necessary to establish uniform measures for preferential freight rates and payment methods to be followed. After joint consultation, it was decided that for all new road construction materials and equipment transported through existing railways, surveying instruments would be transported free of charge. Workers' transportation costs would be calculated at half the ordinary ticket price, and material transportation costs would be calculated at 0.009 yuan per ton per kilometer. If half the ordinary freight rate for a certain material was lower than 0.009 yuan, the ordinary freight rate would still be calculated at half price. All costs would be recorded in the Ministry's accounts. Ferry fees would be paid in full. The above measures would be implemented by all railway bureaus. The railways would provide special convenience and assistance when new road construction materials were transferred or loaded/unloaded to ensure speed and avoid delays.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at Hongxing Sock Factory: Four Union Directors Arrested</h3>
<p>According to the Da Gong She, the Hongxing Sock Factory on Caishi Road in the French Concession employs over 400 male and female workers. Recently, the factory reduced wages in February of this year, causing dissatisfaction among the workers. The workers proposed improved treatment and requested the authorities to mediate. Unexpectedly, at the end of last month, the factory announced a shutdown during the final accounting period, causing panic among the workers. Yesterday morning, they gathered at the factory gate to demand resumption of work. The factory reported to the police, and four union directors, Chen Zunyi, Shi Xiuying, Deng Yixin, and Zheng Hongli, were arrested. Upon hearing the news, party and government officials sent personnel to negotiate, and the situation is still at a standstill.</p>

<h3>Gu Zhuxuan's Appeal Case: Judgment of Acquittal: Zhao Guangfu's Letter to Xue Zhenyi Shows the Extortion Attempt at the Asia Hotel Was Entirely Fabricated</h3>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, the former owner of the Tianchan Stage, director of the Chinese Red Cross Society, head of the Jianghuai Compatriots Association, and native of Yancheng, was reported by Zhao Guangfu and arrested for instigating the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World. He was brought to trial by the Special No. 2 Court according to law. As a result of the trial, Gu was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for 10 years. Gu disagreed with the first-instance judgment and appealed to the High Court's Third Branch, which concluded the trial, overturned the original judgment, and declared him innocent. The judgment of the High Court's Third Branch is as follows (above omitted): Reasons: The victim in this case, Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World Amusement Park, was shot and killed by Zhao Guangfu, Zhang Xiaosizi (i.e., Ting Gui), and others in front of the Great World around 1:00 AM on June 18th of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). The Supreme Court and this court have already separately sentenced Zhao Guangfu to life imprisonment and Zhang Xiaosizi to 20 years of imprisonment, which have been finalized. Therefore, Tang Jiapeng's death was indeed caused by Zhao Guangfu and others. However, whether their motive for killing was due to the appellant Gu Zhuxuan's instigation depends on whether there is solid evidence. According to the accuser Zhao Guangfu's statement at the police station, on the morning of June 16th of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), a friend Zhou Mingxiang, also known as Zhou the Carpenter or Zhou Xiaomujiang, came and said that Gu Zhuxuan (i.e., Gu Silao) wanted to kill his enemy and invited me to participate. I immediately agreed. The two of us went to room 208 on the second floor of the Asia Hotel set up by Gu Zhuxuan on Zilai Street. Soon, Gu Zhuxuan entered the room, and Zhou introduced him as the boss. Gu then claimed that he had</p>
<p>an important enemy</p>
<p>who was the manager of the Great World and had to be killed. He told us to do it without worry, and after the deed was done, he would give us four people 10,000 yuan. Later, Gu Zhuxuan left, and Zhou Mingxiang invited us to the Renhe Teahouse on Hengfeng Road in Zhabei to meet the others. After arriving at the teahouse, five or six people came to ask Zhou Mingxiang. I knew that among them were Zhu Jingui and Zhang Xiaosizi. The appellant firmly denied meeting the accuser at the hotel and instigating murder, claiming that he knew Tang Jiapeng well, had no enmity with him, and had no reason to ask someone to assassinate him. Now, they are trying to extort money from me and have come up with a way to bite me. The first-instance judgment is truly unjust. This court finds that Zhang Xiaosizi and Zhao Guangfu's murder case was under the jurisdiction of the first-instance court from October of the 21st year of the Republic (1932) until it was appealed to the third-instance court, lasting more than a year. Throughout this time, it was never</p>
<p>stated that the murder</p>
<p>of Tang Jiapeng was instigated by the appellant. Even when Xinggao was accused, he stated at the police station that on June 16th, Zhou Ermujiang first introduced him to Wang Xinggao at the Renhe Teahouse. Later, they went together to a room on the second floor of the Dajiangnan Hotel in the Public Concession, where a person about fifty years old entered, and Wang Xinggao pointed him out as Boss Gu Si. The descriptions of the circumstances of the meeting with the appellant are inconsistent. (See the files of the Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Xiaosizi murder case, the Wang Xinggao instigation of murder case, and each instance of this case). Furthermore, regarding the location of the planned murder, the accuser sometimes claimed it was the Dajiangnan Hotel in the Public Concession, sometimes the Dajiangnan Hotel on Avenue Edward VII (Wang Xinggao's accusation letter on January 8th of the 24th year (1935)), and in his complaint, it was</p>
<p>the Asia Hotel</p>
<p>room 208 on the second floor. (Before the accusation, the accuser had filed a complaint with the original trial court, which was rejected; see Zhao Guangfu's complaint against Gu Zhuxuan for instigating murder on July 17th of the 24th year (1935)). When questioned by the police about the inconsistencies, the accuser argued that because he was not familiar with the route, his previous statement about the Dajiangnan Hotel was a mistake, and he actually met Boss Gu Si at the Asia Hotel on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. (Page 54 of the first trial file) Regardless of the fact that the Dajiangnan Hotel (operated by the appellant) was not on Avenue Edward VII but in the Public Concession, and that the second floor of that hotel was not a hotel and had no room 208, as clarified by the manager of that hotel, Zhao Quansun, in the original trial, although the Asia Hotel was previously the Jiangnan Hotel, Jiangnan went bankrupt in February of the 19th year (1930), and</p>
<p>it was changed to Dalu</p>
<p>and then to Asia, which has been verified by police officer Shen Duyang and reported on file. (Page 177 of the original trial file) Therefore, although Asia was transformed from the Jiangnan Hotel, it is clear that it was not the Dajiangnan Hotel. Moreover, after the police station sent officers to the Asia Hotel on Avenue Edward VII to conduct a field survey, the accuser hesitated before going to the second floor. After searching for several minutes and looking at the numbers on the doors, he finally found room 208. (See page 56 of the original trial file) This shows that the accuser's claim of meeting the appellant in room 208 of that hotel is difficult to believe. Also, regarding the amount of compensation, the accuser stated in the Wang Xinggao case that after the deed was done, Shan Wang gave me 100 yuan. In this case, he claimed that Gu Si promised to give us four people</p>
<p>10,000 yuan,</p>
<p>which not only differs greatly from witness Zhang Xiaosizi's claim that each person received 10,000 yuan, but also the accuser and others were laborers. Even if the appellant had enemies, why would he promise such a large sum? This is also outside of ordinary circumstances. Furthermore, after the accuser was in prison, he saw a photo of the appellant in the Oriental Magazine and knew that he was the rich owner of the Tianchan Stage. He intended to borrow 3,000 yuan from him. If he couldn't borrow it, he would ask Xue Zhenyi, a fellow inmate, to think of a way to accuse him. He promised to split the money three to seven with Xue Zhenyi for testifying. This has been testified to by Xue Zhenyi on file (see the transcript of September 27th of the 24th year (1935) in the original trial, and the testimony in this trial is the same), and Zhang Shuchuan also testified that he heard it at the time. (Transcript of October 12th of the 24th year (1935) in the original trial) Later, Xue Zhenyi repeatedly wrote to the appellant</p>
<p>to persuade him to provide assistance</p>
<p>(the original letter is attached to the exhibit file of the first trial). The appellant ignored it. Xue Zhenyi was then transferred to another cell. The accuser wrote a letter in pencil (see exhibit file number 7) instructing Zhang Chenliang, a fellow inmate from Yancheng, to deliver it to Xue Zhenyi. Xue Zhenyi presented the letter in the original trial. The letter stated, "Mr. Zhenyi, you treated me very well in the past. Now I need your help one more time. No matter how much money I get, I will give you 30% to repay your kindness. I hope you won't refuse. I accused Wang Xinggao and got him imprisoned. I originally wanted to get 1,000 yuan from him, but now that he has been sentenced, I can't bear to ask him for money again. (Omitted) Now I want to accuse several rich people. The lawsuit has already been submitted, but there is no news yet. I am asking you to think of a way to be a witness. It doesn't matter if I accuse several</p>
<p>big capitalists,</p>
<p>they can afford it, and it doesn't hurt their virtue. If the accusation doesn't go through, I am sentenced to life imprisonment, I am not afraid of the lawsuit. It doesn't matter if I get a few more years for false accusation. Rich people are afraid of losing face. They wouldn't care about 3,000 or 5,000. Now I want to extort 3,000 yuan from Boss Gu Si. (Omitted) If you don't contact me, I will prepare a few-dollar lawsuit and file it in court. You said before that Boss Gu Si is a special member of the Red Cross, so I am asking you to find someone for me. I will tell the court that you are his student. I should have accused him when I appealed in the detention center, but because you contacted me on behalf of Boss Gu Si and hired a lawyer to write the lawsuit for me, saying I should plead not guilty, now it's not possible (meaning it was) to accuse him after he was declared not guilty. I have a friend named Huang in Zhabei. I asked him to find out about Gu's appearance and car number. I have already seen</p>
<p>the Oriental Magazine</p>
<p>with a picture of Boss Gu Si. I saw it very clearly. I can recognize his face. Please rest assured that if you become a witness for me, we will definitely be able to extort money and split it three to seven with you. Don't forget your testimony. I have an opportunity to talk to you in person. I wish you well. July 14th AM, Zhao Guangfu." Although the accuser denied writing this letter, after the court compared the handwriting, the structure and posture of the words "Zhao Guangfu" were completely consistent with the signature "Zhao Guangfu" on the original letter. Other words on the original letter, such as "I," "heart," "capitalist," and "money," were also consistent in handwriting. Moreover, after writing the letter, the accuser entrusted Zhang Chenliang to deliver it to Xue Zhenyi, which Zhang Chenliang</p>
<p>testified</p>
<p>was true (see the transcript of October 12th of the 24th year (1935) in the first trial and the transcript of February 4th of the 25th year (1936) in the second trial). It is undisputed that the letter was written by the accuser. Furthermore, the accuser's detailed plans to accuse Xue Zhenyi and ask him to give false testimony, not being afraid of being further accused of false accusation, further prove that the accuser intended to collude and accuse after the extortion failed. It was not because the appellant actually instigated the murder of Tang Jiapeng that he came forward to accuse him. His motive is very clear. He also looked at a clear picture of the appellant in the Oriental Magazine and remembered the Huang surname in Zhabei who found out about the appellant's appearance and car number. It is clear that the accuser did not know the appellant before. His previous statement that he met the appellant at the Asia Hotel is entirely fabricated. This letter can be used as evidence in favor of the appellant. Although witness Zhang Xiaosizi</p>
<p>repeatedly stated</p>
<p>that the murder of Tang Jiapeng was instigated by the appellant, after the accusation, the police station brought Zhang Xiaosizi and Xue Zhenyi together. Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Xiaosizi discussed it for a week (transcript of November 27th of the 24th year (1935)). Zhang Xiaosizi couldn't speak well, and Zhao Guangfu taught him how to say that Gu Zhuxuan took out a gun (see the transcript of March 4th of the 25th year (1936)), which was testified to by Xue Zhenyi. Zhang Xiaosizi also admitted that Zhao Guangfu told me to accuse him (referring to the appellant). "If the matter is handled well, there is no way to avoid it." The testimony of this witness was colluded by the accuser and is insufficient to be adopted. Furthermore, the Second Special District Prison discovered a bank account, and the appellant was suspected of</p>
<p>instigating a retraction.</p>
<p>Although Zhang Xiaosizi stated that a fugitive guard Ma Xianxiang told him that Gu Si's woman took out the money, and Gu San (the appellant's brother, named Songmao) and others deposited it into the bank. Ma Xianxiang showed me the bankbook and asked me to retract my testimony. I snatched it away, etc. When questioned, the appellant said that he was in the detention center and had no way of knowing about the bank deposit. When his relatives Gu Songmao, Gu Li, and Zheng Rongsan were questioned, they all denied the matter. It is still impossible to prove where the money deposited in the bank came from. In summary, since it cannot be proven that the appellant actually instigated the murder, even if the bankbook was handled by the appellant's family, it is difficult to use it as a</p>
<p>basis for convicting him.</p>
<p>According to Article 268 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the facts of a crime should be determined based on evidence. Since there is no active evidence to prove that the appellant instigated the murder of Tang Jiapeng, it is difficult to hold him criminally responsible. The original trial court convicted him of instigating murder, which is insufficient to be convincing. The appellant's appeal is not unreasonable. The court should overturn the original judgment and declare the appellant innocent. Based on the above conclusions, according to Article 361, Paragraph 1, Article 356, and Article 293, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text. The prosecutor of this court, Zhao Shibei, performed his duties in court. If he disagrees with this judgment, he should submit a written statement to this court within ten days of delivery, stating the reasons and appealing to the Supreme Court.</p>

In addition, women's programs and others will also be promoted in sequence. The call sign is XQHC, and the frequency is 1300.</p>
<h3>Verdict in the Case of Drug Trafficking Hidden in Summer Cloth: Liu Lixian, Zeng Nansheng, and Others Sentenced to Ten Years of Imprisonment Each</h3>
<p>Liu Lixian from Sichuan, residing at No. 618 Baik Road, secretly established a drug trafficking operation. He purchased morphine raw materials from Sichuan, mixed them into hemp cloth, shipped them to Shanghai by mail, and sold them for profit. The matter was uncovered by Detective Wang Chengying and Detective Qian Xianting of the Narcotics Suppression Department. Liu Lixian, Zheng Qianxiu, Zeng Nansheng (also known as Yong Sheng), and Liu's concubine, Huang Yueying, were arrested. Fifty-two rolls of hemp cloth and fourteen pounds and ten taels of morphine were seized. They were handed over to the First Special Court for interrogation. Zheng and Huang were each released on bail of 2,000 yuan, while Liu and Zeng were remanded in custody. The details of the case have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng continued the trial in the Eighth Criminal Court. The defendants jointly hired Lawyer Fan Gang to defend them. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police department presented the findings of the police investigation, stating that the defendant Liu Lixian had admitted to the police that his motive for drug trafficking originated in the autumn of last year. At that time, he discussed the matter with Zeng Nansheng and they agreed to start a business together. He withdrew 250 yuan from the association as capital. Liu then took the money to Sichuan to purchase goods. He entrusted a friend, Li Guofan, to purchase 400 taels of morphine at five yuan per tael, and 53 bolts of hemp cloth. He hollowed out the center of the cloth, mixed in morphine (nine taels per roll), and entrusted another friend, Hu Qifeng, to ship them to Shanghai via mail, to be received by Wang Hongji Forwarding Company at No. 5, Lane 107, Henan Road. Liu then traveled to Shanghai by boat and went directly to Wang Hongji, transporting the hemp cloth to No. 218 Baik Road. He first gave one bolt to Zeng Nansheng to solicit customers. Zeng then took it to Dr. Liu Yixiang, a Cantonese doctor at No. 5 Yu'an Lane, Lemei Road in the French Concession, for inspection. On June 11, Dr. Liu bought 67 taels of morphine for 510 yuan. On June 18, he found a customer, Wu Yaoting, who was a local drug dealer specializing in trafficking drugs in Tianjin and Shanghai. He bought 50 taels of morphine from Zeng Nansheng for 530 yuan and took it to Tianjin to sell. The police investigated Dr. Liu's whereabouts yesterday and found that Liu had fled with his son. However, Wang Hongji Forwarding Company admitted that on May 30 of this year, they did indeed receive 53 rolls of hemp cloth shipped from Sichuan. Liu Lixian and Zeng Nansheng admitted to drug trafficking, while Zheng Qianxiu and Huang Yueying claimed to have no knowledge of the drug trafficking. Judge Huang reviewed the confessions and sentenced Liu Lixian and Zeng Nansheng to ten years of imprisonment each for jointly and continuously trafficking drugs, and deprived them of their civil rights for ten years. The morphine and other items were confiscated. Zheng Qianxiu and Huang Yueying were found not guilty. The police department waived the right to appeal, and they were released in court.</p>
<h3>Young Widow: Loss of Chastity to the Son of a Wet Nurse: Embezzlement of Retirement Funds After Leaving Home: A Private Prosecution for Fraud and Breach of Trust</h3>
<p>Chen Ajin, a 31-year-old woman from Changshu, residing at No. 3 Renshou Lane, at the intersection of Malang Road and Wangzhi Road in the French Concession, recently filed a criminal self-accusation with the First Special District Court in Shanghai against Jiang Wenbin, a 20-year-old inspector at the "Changzhou First Inn" at No. 412 Zhejiang Road, for fraud and breach of trust. The substance of her lawsuit is as follows: The plaintiff married Chu Chenglong at a young age and had children. Unfortunately, Chu died in the sixteenth year of the Republic, leaving behind a considerable inheritance from his Zhongnan Cigarette Company. The defendant's mother, Jiang Changshi, was the plaintiff's wet nurse, and she recommended her son, Wenbin, to work as an accountant. Unexpectedly, he took the opportunity to seduce the plaintiff. The plaintiff, having lost her husband at a young age, became involved with him. Jiang then instigated her to leave her family and become his partner for life. The plaintiff rashly agreed and left her family in September of the seventeenth year of the Republic, obtaining 4,400 yuan in retirement funds. She deposited 2,500 yuan in the Siming Bank and another 1,000 yuan in the Changshu China Bank under the name of Chen Miaozhen, and kept the remainder for other uses. She then cohabited with him. Later, under the pretext of opening a shop, purchasing land, and lending money, he borrowed money from the plaintiff, gradually absorbing all of her retirement funds. In the twenty-first year of the Republic, the defendant secretly kept another woman in a separate residence. When the plaintiff asked for the money back, he refused to return it. Later, through the mediation of Ma Qingshan and others, they agreed that he would repay the plaintiff 1,200 yuan in four installments, and they ended their cohabitation relationship. However, he has repeatedly failed to repay the debt, committing a crime under Article 339 of the Criminal Code. In addition to the criminal charges, she also filed a civil suit, demanding repayment of 1,200 yuan plus interest at a rate of 1.6% per month until the date of execution. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Daxi of the Fifth Criminal Court summoned the defendant Jiang Wenbin, who hired Lawyer Shen Xingxia to defend him. After questioning by Judge Huang, the hearing was concluded and a date was set for sentencing.</p>

<h3>Lottery for the Shanghai Northwest Two-District National Goods Exhibition: Held Yesterday and Today</h3>
<p>West Shanghai District Scheduled to Open on the 6th</p>
<p>The lottery for the Shanghai North District National Goods Exhibition was held yesterday. Due to time constraints, the opening was postponed to the 10th. The lottery for the Shanghai West District National Goods Exhibition will be held today, with the opening scheduled for the 6th. Details are listed below:</p>
<p>North Shanghai Opening Postponed</p>
<p>The Shanghai North District National Goods Exhibition held a lottery for the booths at 2:00 PM yesterday at the exhibition site at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Keming Road. More than 150 manufacturers attended. Chairman Liu Zhongying reported the list of participants before holding the lottery. The opening was originally scheduled for the 5th, but due to the incomplete construction, it was decided to postpone it to the 10th. Because the East District Exhibition has not yet closed, the association is striving for a novel design for the venue, with the main entrance imitating a palace style and four pavilions set up inside, filled with potted landscapes and colorful cypress trees. The sales department is located in a large shed, and the exhibition department is located on the left side of the venue, open on all sides for easy viewing. There is also a lecture hall, where famous people will be invited to give lectures. If necessary, various recreational activities will be performed. Tickets will not be sold, but will be given away by the manufacturers.</p>
<p>West Shanghai Lottery</p>
<p>After being approved by the Social Affairs Bureau, the Shanghai West District National Goods Exhibition received enthusiastic participation from manufacturers, with only a few remaining spaces. The manufacturers who registered are scheduled to draw lots at 2:00 PM today, with the opening on the 6th. Yesterday, the association sent letters to Chen Jicheng, Wang Manyun, Cao Zhigong, Zhang Wenkui, Wang Jian'e, and others to serve as lecturers.

<h3>Adultery Exposed, Evil Thoughts Arose: Case of Chinese Detective Killing Concluded Yesterday: One Bullet Still Lodged in the Head of Jiao Gu's Wife: Chinese Detective Zhang Junmou Admits to Firing the Shot: The Court Scheduled to Announce the Verdict on the 10th of This Month</h3>
<p>Wu Yujing, residing at No. 3 Tonghe Lane, Fuxu Road, worked as a driver for the Xiang Sheng Motor Company. His wife, Chen Suzhen (also known as Wu Chen), had an affair with Chinese detective Zhang Junmou, No. 2650, of the Huishan Police Station, a native of Anhui. Wu and Jiao Changgui's wife, Jiao Gu (also known as Mapipi), reported the matter to the police station. Zhang Junmou learned of this and harbored resentment. On June 2, at 5:00 AM, he went to Tonghe Lane and shot and killed Jiao Changgui, and</p>
<p>Wounded his wife, Jiao Gu. The police arrested Zhang Junmou and Wu Chen and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation. The details of the case have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng continued the trial in the Eighth Criminal Court. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police department stated that, as instructed by the previous court hearing, the police had attempted to bring the two bloody clothes from that time to the case, but Jiao Changgui's bloody clothes had already been used for burial, and Jiao Gu's bloody clothes had also been washed, so they could not be brought to the case. Jiao Gu is still lying in</p>
<p>Ward 104 of Baolong Hospital. There is still a bullet lodged in her skull, which cannot be removed. Although she is no longer in immediate danger, there is a possibility that her mental state may be unclear. An X-ray photograph taken by the doctor is submitted as evidence. The photograph shows Jiao Gu's skull, with a white dot inside, which is the location of the lodged bullet. Zhang Junmou confessed that he came to Shanghai in 1918, and after dropping out of school at the age of 18, he served in the army, then came to Shanghai</p>
<p>To work as a police officer. He lived in Yihe Lane, Huaji Road, and was acquainted with Wu Yujing. They often visited each other. Starting from April 16 of this year, he lived in Wu's house for two weeks. He never had any playful interactions with Wu Chen. Because Chen had been subjected to various forms of abuse by Wu for more than ten years since she married him, my relationship with her was mutually consensual. On May 28 of this year, after Wu Chen ran away from home, she lived with me at the Tiande Hotel. Unexpectedly, her husband Wu Yujing and Jiao Mapipi reported to the police station, accusing me of abduction. After investigating</p>
<p>It was found that Chen's departure was voluntary, so why should they falsely accuse and slander me? Out of anger, I discussed the matter with her in the hotel. I advised her to return home quickly, but she said she would not go back. I also said I was willing to die with her, but Jiao Mapipi could not be let off. Therefore, I decided to kill Jiao Gu first, and then commit suicide together. So I hired a Republican car to go to</p>
<p>Intended to kill Jiao Mapipi, but I had no intention of killing her husband, Jiao Changgui. In fact, Jiao resisted at the time, trying to snatch my gun, which led to his accidental death. Wu Chen confessed that because Jiao Mapipi, who lived upstairs, made accusations to my husband, my husband often quarreled with me. When I ran away from home on May 28, I told my husband that I wanted to work at the Gongda Cotton Mill. Unexpectedly, Jiao Mapipi</p>
<p>Forcibly testified and went to the police station with my husband to accuse Zhang Junmou of abduction. Zhang was so angry that this unfortunate incident occurred. The court, finding the case clear, instructed the lawyers of both parties to present their arguments. It then ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody separately, pending the announcement of the verdict on the 10th of this month.</p>

<h3>China International Famine Relief Commission Repairs the Jiangsu-Shandong Transportation Road</h3>
<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission, located at No. 505 Henan Road, allocated $70,000 to implement work relief to help the victims of the disaster in northern Jiangsu Province.

<h3>Gangsters with Weapons Board Russian Ship in Huangpu River to Extort Money</h3>
<p>Demanding 70 cents per person; they fled when the Water Patrol arrived.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been incidents of impersonating public officials and extorting illegal fees in the Huangpu River near Yangjiadu in the Nanshi area. A Russian merchant ship had just arrived in Shanghai from another port. When the ship reached the center of the Huangpu River in Yangjiadu, a large group of more than twenty gangsters suddenly approached the ship in small boats. Some of them were carrying weapons such as pistols and iron bars. They extorted illegal fees from the passengers on board, demanding 70 cents per person, claiming to be public officials and collecting fees under orders. If anyone disobeyed, they would threaten the passengers with their weapons. After crew members Chen Desheng and Wang Jinbiao reported to the Water Patrol, Chief Wei immediately ordered detectives such as Deng Jiagen to work with patrolling police officers to rush to the scene of the incident to make arrests at around 3 PM yesterday afternoon. However, the gangsters had already fled upon hearing the news. A suspect, Chen Buji, was apprehended near the scene and taken to the team headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Car Thieves Still Rampant in Nanshi</h3>
<p>Since the human-powered rickshaw merchants organized a non-redemption group, the French Concession Police Department arrested and severely punished a number of key figures, and car thieves disappeared from the concession for several months. They all displayed their theft and fraud techniques in the Shiliupu Ningshao Wharf area. While the rickshaw pullers were away from their vehicles, picking up passengers, or turning around to buy food, they would also use excuses such as hiring a rickshaw or paying the fare to trick the rickshaw pullers into leaving further away, and then steal the vehicles. Within a short period of time, the rubber from the wheels would be stripped off and discarded in remote places. This gave the rubber parts installed by various car merchants at the Public Works Bureau Vehicle Office an opportunity to be stolen. It is reported that as many as fourteen vehicles belonging to the non-redemption group of car merchants were stolen last month, all with rubber attachments stripped off. They were collected and claimed by various branches of the Public Security Bureau and the security regiment. The rickshaw pullers compensated three yuan each. At this time of sluggish business, this unexpected loss of three yuan was difficult to raise in a short period of time, and they all cried out in pain. The situation was extremely tragic. It is said that the reason why these car thieves have made a comeback is that many of the leaders and accomplices have been released from Caohejing Prison recently. It is hoped that the municipal authorities will quickly find a way to eliminate them, relieving the suffering of the poor laborers.</p>
<h3>Cruel Daughter-in-Law Abuses Father-in-Law, Who Hangs Himself</h3>
<p>Tan Yongxiang was unable to eat his fill; Tan Zhu Clan fled in fear of punishment.</p>
<p>Tan Yongxiang, a 75-year-old man from Yangzhou, and his wife, Wei Clan, a 67-year-old woman, both lived at No. 5, Heng 10, Zhuhu Road, Gaochang Temple, Nanshi. Tan had a son named Wen Kui, 35 years old, who lived with his wife, Zhu Clan, at No. 11 of the alley. Wen Kui worked as a laborer on a certain ship, and Wei Clan worked as a helper outside. Tan's clothing, food, and other items were all taken care of by his daughter-in-law, Zhu Clan. Unexpectedly, Zhu Clan had a violent nature and intentionally treated her father-in-law's diet harshly, so that he could not eat his fill. Tan could not bear this and developed the idea of suicide. Suddenly, in the middle of the night before last night, he hanged himself to death. Yesterday morning at about 9:00 AM, Wei Clan discovered this and urgently summoned her son Wen Kui to her home to inquire. Unexpectedly, Zhu Clan suddenly fled in fear of punishment. Tan Wei Clan immediately went to the Ximen Branch with her son Wen Kui to report and request the arrest of her fleeing daughter-in-law for investigation. The bureau, considering that the matter involved human life, immediately ordered the local police to report to the Shanghai District Court to send personnel to examine the body.</p>
<h3>Leader of Thirty-Two "Opening Knife" Gang Arrested Again After Being Released on Bail</h3>
<p>He confessed the situation after the "opening knife" operation, implicating a certain police officer Sui.</p>
<p>Recently, it was heard in Zhabei that there was an organization of thirty-two so-called "opening knife" gangs, led by Zhou Dabaozi. Director Cai Jingjun of the Municipal Public Security Bureau heard about this and secretly ordered Chief Zhang Datong of the Detective General Team to find a way to investigate. After receiving the order, Chief Zhang received a secret report on the 1st of this month that Zhou Dabaozi was hiding in a certain place in Zhabei. He immediately sent the second squad leader, Xue Shilin, along with foremen Huang Peiting, detective Yu Liangzhi, and others. They successfully apprehended Zhou Dabaozi and took him in for interrogation. He was soon released on bail by someone at the court. However, the Public Security Bureau received many complaints from merchants and residents of Zhabei, so the team arrested Kong Jinsheng, a "knife opener" from Yangzhou. According to his confession, Zhou Dabaozi was indeed the leader, and he implicated a certain Sui, who used to be a police officer at the Hengfeng Road Police Station. He said that after carrying out the "opening knife" operation, they often stayed in the hospital and could not get any money. All the contact and extortion matters were handled by Officer Sui and Zhou Dabaozi. Based on this confession, the team took Kong to a small teahouse across from the Hengfeng Road Police Station in Zhabei and arrested Zhou Jian, also known as Zhou Binzi, from Funing. They have now been taken to the General Team for interrogation to arrest the remaining members of the gang.</p>

<h3>Joint Meeting of the Sixth and Eighth Branch Associations of the Shanghai Second Special District Municipal Federation</h3>
<p>The Sixth and Eighth Branch Associations of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation held their second joint executive committee meeting yesterday. More than 20 people attended. Chairman Wu Guowei reported on the work and income and expenditure accounts of the Association in June, followed by discussion of the agenda. (1) Members Yu Yongxing and Ganshenghe reported that the French Municipal Council had newly levied a kerosene tax because kerosene sales were extremely low, and requested that negotiations be conducted to cancel the tax in order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. The Sixth Branch Association forwarded the letter to the French Municipal Council for resolution. Mr. Threlles was requested to consider the small volume of kerosene sales and withdraw the order, but there has been no reply and the matter remains unresolved. The council is dispatching personnel to collect the tax. The two members have sent another letter requesting prompt negotiations. It was resolved that a letter should be sent again to the French Municipal Council, earnestly requesting the cancellation of the kerosene tax. (2) Member Fuzhengyuan reported that the French Municipal Council had doubled the wine tax. Because the scope of the shop was extremely small, only the hostess worked in the shop, and no employees were hired, and the business was sluggish. The Sixth Branch Association had sent a letter to the council requesting that the tax be exempted, but no reply had been received. How should this be handled? It was resolved that the French Municipal Council should be sent a letter reiterating the previous request to exempt the tax. (3) Member Fuyuanyuan Restaurant attached the sale of soda and beer in the summer and selling Shaoxing wine at ordinary times. The number is small, but the French Municipal Council ordered it to obtain a license as a first-class wine merchant. The garden is of a consignment nature and cannot afford to bear a first-class donation. It has been reported that negotiations should be conducted to reduce the wine tax to one yuan and four cents per month, and the soda and beer tax to one yuan per month, to be consistent with the consignment. The Sixth Branch Association has sent a letter to negotiate, but has not received a reply. How should this be handled? It was resolved that another letter should be sent to negotiate based on the facts, requesting that the council send personnel to investigate and reduce the amount of the donation. (4) Zhang Zhiqing, Gu Wenming, Xu Youxiang, Hu Maoxiang, Xu Yuxiang, Qian Yuexiang, Cai Jinsheng, Wang Xiaomao, and other stallholders from Leimilu Vegetable Market, members, led more than 20 other stallholders to petition the Eighth Branch Association because the patrol was ordered to move the stalls to the sidewalk for traffic reasons. Unexpectedly, many unlicensed stalls (commonly known as "wild chicken stalls") came to set up, so that the traffic was still not wide, and the business of the stallholders was greatly affected. The matter was reported by the Eighth Branch Association to the Foch Road patrol. Second, the arrest team secretly dispatched secret orders to drive them away, but they could not be thoroughly maintained before walking and after arranging, The shops were inconvenient for customers to trade because the stalls were placed along the sidewalk, and the loss of the stallholders was especially unjustified, so they came to petition, requesting the French Municipal Council to negotiate and restore the previous setting of stalls. It was resolved that a letter be sent to the Director General of the French Municipal Council requesting the restoration of the stalls so that unlicensed stalls would have no way to intervene, and a letter be sent to the police to step up the crackdown on unlicensed stalls. (5) The Sixth and Eighth Branch Associations co-organized the Department of Handling Documents for Society. It was resolved to approve the establishment.</p>

<h3>Miss Yue'er Continues to Sing for Three Days</h3>
<p>The Haizhu Theater on Fusheng Road hired Miss Yue'er to sing famous Cantonese songs for three days from the 1st to the 3rd of this month. Even in the hot summer, the seats were still full. The audience applauded and praised the ladies for every song, and the atmosphere in the venue was tense. Until the end of the show, the audience was still reluctant to leave. The enthusiastic scene was created because the singing period of three days was too short. Now the theater has received a number of letters and telegrams from the audience requesting that Miss Yue'er be retained to sing for three more days. The theater could not refuse the warm invitation and has hired her to return to sing for three more days from the 4th of this month.

<h3>A Correspondent's Account of the World Games Delegation</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Feng Youzhen of the Central News Agency</p>
<p>An Epoch-Making Feat in the History of Chinese Sports</p>
<p>The Olympic Games originated in Greece more than 2,700 years ago. Initially, it was stipulated that the games would be held every four years. However, after the 13th Games, due to the decline of Greek culture, the games ceased. It was not until the end of the 19th century, through the efforts of the French Baron Pierre de Coubertin, that the modern Olympic Games were revived at the International Sports Conference held in Paris in June 1894. Subsequently, the first modern games were held in Athens, the capital of Greece, in 1896. Since then, the games have been held every four years, alternating between the capitals or major cities of various countries. Each time, the number of participating athletes from various countries ranges from more than 3,000 to at least 400 or 500, making it the only grand gathering in international sports competitions. To date, the games have been held ten times, with a history of 40 years.</p>
<p>China's participation in this kind of international competition began with the 10th Games held in Los Angeles, USA, in 1932. However, there was only one sprinter, Liu Changchun, accompanied by officials Shen Siliang and Song Junfu. Although our national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth was raised in the Olympic stadium for the first time, in reality, that participation could only be considered exploratory.</p>
<p>This year's 11th Games, which will open in Berlin, Germany, on August 1st, will see China officially sending a delegation of athletes and sports inspectors, totaling more than 100 people, to participate in a grand and momentous event. Naturally, when comparing the achievements of our athletes with those of the top athletes from various countries, it is truly like a small sorcerer meeting a great one, and winning points is just a dream and an extravagance. However, our athletes already have a considerable foundation, and they can easily gain more experience in technique by participating in this event, which will raise the standard of our sports and increase the interest of the entire nation in sports. This will open a new path for sports in our country and mark a new era. Therefore, this feat of a long journey of thousands of miles, although costing one or two hundred thousand of the people's hard-earned money, is by no means meaningless.</p>
<p>The Delegation's Lineup</p>
<p>The events in which China will participate this time include eight official events: soccer, basketball, track and field, race walking, swimming, weightlifting, cycling, and boxing, as well as Chinese martial arts performances. In addition, there is a sports inspection delegation of more than 30 people accompanying them to Germany (the full list has already been published, so it is omitted). The entire group totals 144 people. Among them, Mr. and Mrs. Dai and Wang have already departed in advance, and the soccer team has also gone to Southeast Asia for matches and is scheduled to rejoin the team in Mumbai on July 9th. Apart from the representative stationed in Germany who has already arrived and the swimming athletes who boarded the ship in Hong Kong, the rest of the personnel departed from Shanghai on the liner Conte Verde on June 26th. There is also a sightseeing group organized by the China Travel Service, totaling 31 people, traveling on the same ship.</p>
<p>Farewell to the Motherland</p>
<p>At noon on June 26th, the main team of the delegation boarded the Italian shipping company's Conte Verde at the China Merchants North Pier in Shanghai for a long journey abroad. The pier was filled with an expectedly lively scene. Several thousand people lined up on the dock, constantly shouting and cheering. Amidst the clanging and melodious military music, there were bursts of firecrackers, coupled with airplanes soaring in the sky, which heightened everyone's emotions to the extreme. At 12:15 PM, the gong on the ship sounded the final warning of departure. Those standing on the dock and those leaning against the ship's railing busily threw colorful ribbons, weaving a net full of passion. As the ship gradually moved away amidst the long whistle, the colorful ribbons full of farewell passion snapped. After waving handkerchiefs and shouting to each other, we watched the figures on the dock waver and disappear. Thus, we bid farewell to our motherland and embarked on a journey of ten thousand miles. The reporter is now sitting in the smoking room, starting to write this correspondent's account. Although more than an hour has passed and the vibration of the engine is disturbing enough to make one's head spin, the lively scene of departure is deeply etched in my mind and has not dissipated in the slightest.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Notes on the Ship</p>
<p>The Italian shipping company has three ships that sail in the Indian Ocean between Venice and Shanghai: Conte Verde, Conte Rosso, and Victoria. It is said that Victoria is the newest and best-equipped. Conte Verde is the largest, with a total of 18,765 tons. The ship's staff, from the captain to the cooks, are all Italian. The tea servers wear white uniforms, speak English, and are courteous. The cabins are divided into first class, second class, economic second class, and third and fourth class. First class is, of course, the most elaborate. Each cabin has one berth and is decorated very elegantly. In addition, the smoking rooms are gilded and magnificent, and the murals in the music room fully express the mood of Italian art. In the evening, the music room plays elegant music, and famous films are shown on the deck, allowing every passenger to forget all the boredom of the journey. However, this superior privilege is only enjoyed by first-class passengers.</p>
<p>The facilities in second class and economic second class are roughly similar, but very different from first class. Third-class cabins are just dormitories. When you walk through there, a foul odor violently stabs your nostrils, making you want to vomit. It is said that in order to compete for business, shipping companies in various countries try their best to improve the first-class cabins, paying little attention to the interests of second and third-class passengers. In capitalist countries filled with the stench of money, this situation is not surprising. In our delegation, only representatives Hao Gengsheng and Shen Siliang and German consultant Kurt stayed in first-class cabins, while the rest stayed in economic second class. However, there were not enough cabins on the ship, so some of the female athletes and staff stayed in second-class cabins. Economic second class has four people in one room. The fare from Shanghai to Venice and back was originally set at 78 pounds, but this time, due to the preferential treatment for our athletes, it was discounted to 45 pounds. Second class costs about half more, and first class costs half more than second class.</p>
<p>There are four meals a day: breakfast from 7:00 to 9:00 AM, lunch at 11:30 AM, afternoon tea at 4:00 PM, and dinner at 6:30 PM. Because of the sudden increase in a large number of passengers, there were not enough tables, so each meal was divided into two shifts. The first shift was for our delegation, and the second shift was for other passengers.</p>
<p>Lunch and dinner are the main meals of the day: a cup of clear soup, a glass of cold water, a piece of hard bread, three dishes, and a piece of fruit. There is more than enough in terms of quantity, but the quality is really not worth mentioning. Except for the cup of clear soup, which tastes palatable, the three dishes are all cold and stale, giving off a sour smell. The bread is so hard that it is almost impossible to chew, but it smells very fragrant. Many people cannot swallow the dishes and instead use bread and ice water to fill their stomachs. The seasonings are only salt and coarse pepper. Breakfast and afternoon tea include butter, jam, and a cup of lemon tea, milk, or coffee. It is said that the food supplies on the ship are all stocked up before departing from Venice. Unless it is absolutely necessary, they will not replenish food supplies elsewhere. After a voyage of more than 20 days, when returning from Shanghai to Venice, all the food stored in the refrigerator will, of course, taste like chewing wax, not to mention the nutritional value. In fact, this situation is not unique to Italian shipping companies. All the countries that are now called first-class powers adhere to the belief of using only their own national products. Only our China, at this time of national crisis, still has the phenomenon of helping to transport and sell smuggled goods. Every time I walk into the dining room, I feel ashamed of their simple and practical spirit.</p>
<p>There are many bathrooms on the ship, and taking a bath every day is not a problem. However, because the laundry storage capacity is limited, one must first wash with muddy seawater and then shower with clean water. The price of washing clothes is very expensive: five pence for each undershirt and shorts, eight pence for cotton or wool, the same price for shirts, one penny per pair of socks, and double the price for silk or wool. Handkerchiefs are the same price. The athletes all wash their clothes themselves in the evening.</p>
<p>Economic second class has an unofficial route to first and second class. If you want to go, they will not interfere. Perhaps this is because of the preferential treatment for the athletes. However, the athletes living in economic second class feel comfortable with their lives and rarely go there unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<h3>The Location of the Next World Games to be Discussed by the International Committee at the End of This Month</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Berlin, 2nd The location of each session of the Olympic Games is usually decided in advance by the International Olympic Committee through a secret ballot. Once decided, it cannot be changed. The next, 12th Olympic Games are scheduled to be held in 1940, and the issue of the location needs to be decided in advance. The International Olympic Committee is scheduled to meet here on the morning of the 29th of this month to discuss this matter. The International Olympic Committee has a total of 63 members, and 55 of them are expected to attend. It has been found that the countries currently competing for the venue include Japan, Finland, England, and Italy. According to the chairman of the German Olympic Committee, Lewart, the Olympic Games were held in London in 1908, and it is surprising that England is making this request again. Italy's request is also unusual, as they had previously made this request, but had decided to withdraw it at the start of the Italo-Abyssinian War.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Women's Special Issue</p>
<h3>Ten Essential Rules for Housewives</h3>
<p>— Fan Xianwei</p>
<p>A housewife is an important figure in the family. Her every word and action greatly influence her children and husband. For example, if the housewife herself often curses, how can she prevent others from cursing? If she herself is often very lazy, how can she ask others to do things diligently? As the saying goes, "See good examples, learn good examples." This is very true. The following ten items are what housewives should practice diligently. It is hoped that all wives and grandmothers will abide by them!</p>
<p>1. Get up first every morning and lead your children in taking deep breaths for 15 minutes. Check once before and after in the evening and be the last to go to bed.</p>
<p>2. Go to the market yourself every day to shop for food and cook it yourself, without relying on servants.</p>
<p>3. Record the food consumption every night, calculate the amount, and summarize it at the end of the month.</p>
<p>4. Supervise your children in reviewing their lessons every morning and evening.</p>
<p>5. Check whether all furniture is clean every day and do a major cleaning every week.</p>
<p>6. Do not gamble, do not curse, do not perm your hair, do not smoke or drink, do not wear makeup, do not wear high heels.</p>
<p>7. Do not burn incense and chant scriptures, and do not set foot in vulgar entertainment venues.</p>
<p>8. Take your children out for outdoor activities once a week, such as playing in the park or going on a trip to the suburbs.</p>
<p>9. Only buy domestic products for food and clothing, and only wear fancy clothes for social events.</p>
<p>10. Treat your husband with love and sincerity. If you can comply, then be patient and comply. If you really cannot bear it (such as if your husband has an affair or an addiction), you should gently persuade him and not speak harshly! Treat servants with forgiveness and kindness. If they make small mistakes, guide them and correct them, and do not show it in your expression. Educate your children by using persuasive methods and absolutely do not use old-fashioned scolding and corporal punishment.</p>
<h3>The Pressing Issues for Women After Graduation</h3>
<p>— Xishan</p>
<p>——Marriage? Employment?——</p>
<p>This is indeed a rather serious issue. After a young woman graduates and steps out of the school gate, should she marry or should she seek employment?</p>
<p>To discuss these two issues, the first thing that should be involved is: whether the young woman's life continues to depend on the family after graduation? Otherwise, she should seek economic independence, because economics is the prerequisite for the two major issues after graduation. We know that when a woman is still living in school, all her monetary expenses must be borne by her father, brother, or relatives. But once she graduates, whether the family's economic provider can continue to maintain the status quo becomes a problem. At the same time, in ordinary circumstances, rushing into marriage, although marriage is a necessary process for a woman, it is difficult to produce true happiness in such circumstances. The facts clearly tell us that the day a woman gets married is also the day her ambitions are extinguished. Moreover, without economic independence, women cannot obtain a superior position in any field.</p>
<p>Therefore, the second issue for women after graduation arises in employment. Employment, on the one hand, can enable them to achieve economic independence, and on the other hand, can enable them to have freedom in life. Originally, women's employment did not necessarily have to involve contact with society. In the past, handicrafts were prevalent in Chinese families. However, today, with the development of science and the mass production of machinery, the handicraft system has long been reduced to a position where it cannot exist. Women in families simply do not want to hope for economic assistance, so today's women who want to seek economic independence cannot but contact society. In this way, under the employment of women, a widespread vice has also arisen: "infection with inferior customs." This is the most difficult event to avoid in women's employment today, especially in the evil metropolis. Due to social interactions, imitation, and contact, it is very easy for a woman to be infected with all kinds of bad habits, indirectly and directly, and to indulge her body day by day. In the most prosperous areas of women's employment in Europe and the United States, most women are infected with bad habits, such as: excessive indulgence in smoking and drinking, indiscriminate association with the opposite sex, etc... Therefore, various incidents of miscarriage, abortion, and illegitimate children... occur particularly frequently in those places. This alone is enough to give us a clear example. Secondly, damage to health is also unavoidable in women's employment today, because women's bodies, whether from the perspective of physiological structure or physical strength, are not as good as men's. Of course, they cannot perform the same labor as men. However, in fact, many stores and companies treat women's working hours and positions the same as men's, so it is very easy for women to have phenomena of overwork, which is of great damage to their health.</p>
<p>So, should women marry or should they seek employment after graduation? From the many past examples, we cannot find a concrete and definite answer in the conclusion.</p>
<p>But in the end, I sincerely hope that every woman after graduation should pay serious attention to these two personal issues.</p>
<h3>The Shift in Moral Concepts Between the Sexes</h3>
<p>— Meng Su</p>
<p>Today, most people still hold unreasonable views on issues between the sexes. A large part of the evils in society originate from issues of sex. The light of reason has not yet been able to dispel the clouds and mists to reveal the clear sky between the sexes. To transform society, it is hopeless without re-evaluating these traditional fallacious concepts. The modern women's movement can be regarded as moving along this new path.</p>
<p>Generally, unjust facts are caused by distorted environments and customs. The construction of a new society requires that sexual behavior between the sexes must arise from legitimate marriage. Extramarital promiscuous behavior must be prohibited, and the monogamous system must be established.</p>
<p>The adherence to monogamy is primarily due to the circumstances in which one finds oneself. For example, living in a sparsely populated rural area, couples spend day and night together. If the man does not often travel far from home and has fewer opportunities to come into contact with other women, then the couple can easily be devoted to their conjugal affection. However, if the man travels far from home alone or lives in a metropolis, it is more difficult to prevent him from engaging in extramarital affairs.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is due to religious belief. Religion often considers lust as a major taboo; especially adultery, which will lead to damnation in hell or retribution. Therefore, ordinary people fear the punishment of the unseen and remain chaste. This also has a great impact on ordinary society.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it is due to social sanctions. Fickle men and lewd women are generally hated by people. Men, in order to cherish their reputation, dare not have thoughts of adultery, and women are ashamed of gossip and would rather resist. This forms a general good custom.</p>
<p>In agricultural societies, people live in fixed locations. The actions of neighbors and villagers are well known to each other. All men and women who restrain themselves, in order to avoid the blame of customs, distinguish themselves from their spouses and do not infringe upon each other. As for modern capitalist society, in every city, residents are densely populated and move frequently. Although they live next door to each other, they often do not know each other. Whether drifting men and women will not be tempted by new relationships and whether they will adhere to monogamy is something no one can control. The religious notions of heaven and hell are no longer sufficient to bind people's hearts. Stories of so-called depravity and rampant human desires are common and overlooked.</p>
<p>Although the law stipulates monogamy, in fact, the fleeting relationships and illicit affairs, the frivolous pursuit of pleasure, in various forms, create a bizarre and filthy society of polygamy or polyandry. In this way, the moral issues between the sexes cannot be discussed.</p>
<p>Morality and law are not immutable. So-called good morals and good laws must be judged by whether they can increase human happiness. Moral concepts and the legal basis between men and women shift with the economic system of society. For thousands of years, the patriarchal society has been established because women's economy cannot be independent. The husband bears the responsibility of supporting his wife, and the wife becomes the husband's subordinate. After illegal issues between the sexes occur, the blame on the woman is particularly heavy. According to the general secular view, if the wife is unchaste, the husband loses face. Men, in order to maintain face, have the right to impose moral constraints and legal sanctions on women. Conversely, if the man is unchaste, at most the wife loses favor; there is no loss of face. The wife's actions towards her husband are limited to gentle persuasion or quarrels, but she cannot impose moral or legal sanctions. This is a natural result of the patriarchal system. If the social and economic system fundamentally changes, this moral concept and legal basis will be fundamentally shaken.</p>
<p>In modern issues between men and women, women have gained some liberation in two areas: the freedom of divorce and the freedom of remarriage. In ancient Chinese society, only men unilaterally divorced their wives, while women were expected to "follow the chicken if married to a chicken, and follow the dog if married to a dog." If a woman was dissatisfied with her husband and acted freely, she would be branded with the evil reputation of "elopement." When a man lost his wife, he could marry again and again for reasons such as having no children or needing someone to manage the household. If a woman lost her husband and remarried, society would look at her with cold eyes. Bai Juyi's "The Widow's Lament" best expresses the grievances of women.</p>
<p>"...People say husband and wife are close, joined together as one. But when it comes to life and death, how can joy and sorrow be shared? The woman remains alone, guarding her solitary bed, like a tree in the forest, suddenly broken by the wind. Once broken, it cannot regrow, and even in death, it clings to its integrity. But if a man dies, he does not grieve for long! He is like a willow tree in front of the gate, easily flourishing in spring; if the wind breaks a branch, there is still another branch to grow..."</p>
<p>This cry of injustice, although it has shifted with the times, still awaits the continued efforts of the women's community for the fundamental transformation of concepts!</p>
<h3>The Widow</h3>
<p>— Chan Yi</p>
<p>In the year she was twenty-one years old, her husband passed away. When her husband was dying, he instructed her to remain chaste for him. Originally, the feelings between the two of them were very deep. At that moment of eternal farewell, she disregarded everything and resolutely agreed to her husband's dying wish.</p>
<p>She did indeed change her clothes and disfigure her face, abandoning all the joys of the world, to be a permanent widow, until the time of her death.</p>
<p>Many people were saddened for her, that such a young woman should encounter such a terrible fate. Of course, it is good to remain chaste for her husband. However, it cannot be ignored that this is only a temporary emotional impulse. Whether she can permanently remain true to her original intention is still a question; it is more reasonable to say that it is better not to remain chaste now than to have problems arise later. Really, can a young widow live a life of solitude?</p>
<p>Some people also say that to remain chaste, one must have the conditions to do so. First, one must have children to have future hope, and second, if there are no children, one must have property so that life can be comfortable. However, she has neither of these two conditions. In fact, it seems that she has no possibility of enduring the hardship, but these conditions cannot take away her resolute ambition.</p>
<p>Her family was originally very poor, and her life was completely maintained by her grandfather and uncle. Sometimes she also felt insufficient. In this poverty, she also did some needlework with her mother to supplement the deficiency. Although she tasted all kinds of hardships, she had no complaints.</p>
<p>From that time until now, more than twenty years have passed. The time of youth has also passed. From now on, it is expected that there will be no more problems. The shackles of the old ethics made her succeed in becoming a perfect person.</p>
<p>Now, she has inherited a son from her uncle. That child is only three years old this year, but he is very lively and lovely. She holds him in her arms all day long, kissing him. When she thinks about the future happiness, completely in this child, she can't help but be overjoyed, and a smile spreads across her pale face. Is this pale complexion the relic of her past youthful depression?</p>

<h3>Those Who Change from Hairpins to Hats Under Medicine and Surgery</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhenchi (Sent from England)</p>
<p>In the past, the "Song of Everlasting Regret" said, "So they cause all fathers and mothers in the world, not to value the birth of sons, but to value the birth of daughters," and I couldn't help but feel like Du Fu's "I know that giving birth to sons is evil, it is better to give birth to daughters." Reading Ms. Huang Chonggu's line, "If the yamen allows me to bare my belly, I wish Heaven would transform me into a son," I also feel that being born a man, able to admire a beautiful woman, is not necessarily unpleasant. However, the power of life and death lies in Heaven, and the determination of sexual organs has never been controlled by human beings. All complaints, envy, and hope, even for men and women themselves, are nothing more than an extra effort. I am now writing to sigh for the ancient beings, as foolish as this. But is the formation of male and female sexual organs truly immutable? Those born with both male and female sexual organs, the so-called hermaphrodites, what will happen to them? Can those wearing men's hats and women's clothes not be ridiculed? What are the surgical procedures for changing and correcting sexual organs in medicine? Are there any absolutely conclusive results? These are all things that we want to know.</p>
<p>Chinese society has many strange stories about men turning into women, women turning into men, and roosters laying eggs, and hens turning into roosters. Last year, there was still a comedic farce about a certain Miss in the north turning into a man. However, in medical records, there is absolutely no irrefutable evidence. Helpless, let us seek it in books!</p>
<p>In England, these kinds of sexual transformations are collectively called "Sex Reversal." There are many cases recorded in books, the most notable being:</p>
<p>1. In 1930, a baby in Shoreham, Sussex, was originally registered as a female at birth but was later examined by a doctor and restored to male.</p>
<p>2. In 1932, a 29-year-old woman in Manchester underwent surgery and reverted to male.</p>
<p>3. In 1934, a 15-year-old girl in Fifeshire similarly reverted to male.</p>
<p>4. In 1935, a 10-year-old boy in Devon similarly reverted to female.</p>
<p>5. Four years ago, a 22-year-old woman discovered that she was gradually turning into a man, with her beard growing rapidly, and went to Charing Cross Hospital in London for treatment. The head surgeon of the hospital, Dr. L.R. Broster, removed a gland in her abdomen called (Adrenals Oreton), and she quickly regained her female appearance.</p>
<p>6. According to statistics from Charing Cross Hospital, the hospital has changed the appearance of more than 25 women into men, all with detailed records for reference.</p>
<p>7. A recent case of a female athlete turning into a man that spread throughout society is particularly noteworthy. A female athlete from Oreton, near Plymouth, named Mary Edith Louise Weston, had a tall and outstanding physique since childhood, with a male demeanor. In 1924, she won the All-England Women's Javelin Championship and held the title for six years. In 1927, she won the All-England Women's Iron Ball Championship, and her name spread throughout society. Before gaining fame, she worked in a clothing store and also studied nursing and massage, obtaining a massage diploma and running a good business for many years. Later, she accidentally joined a women's sports association and discovered her athletic talent, and her name shook the three islands. When she went to Plagne in 1928 to participate in the International Athletic Games, she began to question her own gender. After much hesitation, she consulted medical experts and finally decided to undergo surgery. The location of her surgery was still the aforementioned Charing Cross Hospital. After undergoing two surgeries, she obtained an official certificate from the head surgeon and began to live as a man. According to her own account, thirty years of makeup was like a dream. The former lipstick (but never lipstick), shaving armpits, perming hair, beautiful clothes, stockings, and high heels have now been replaced by handshakes and kisses, which are simply affectionate. She also said that she would change her name to Mark Weston and no longer participate in any sports competitions.</p>
<p>As for sex reversal facts in other countries, there are also two that are well-known in the world.</p>
<p>1. In 1931, a Danish magician became a woman. There is an official record of this case in the Copenhagen local government.</p>
<p>2. A few months ago, a Czechoslovakian woman, Miss Konbek, reverted to a man. Miss Konbek's team was a famous athlete who participated in the International Athletic Games in White City in 1934 and set a new world record in the 800-meter race. After multiple surgeries, she completely changed her appearance. However, it is not known how to resolve the issue of Kan's world record. Should it be considered a record for male athletes? Or a record for the Kan team? It may not be easy for sports experts to make a judgment.</p>
<p>The above are all real examples. In summary, first, women with athletic talents have the possibility of changing to men, and men with artistic talents also have a certain possibility of changing to women. This is because what is inside manifests outside, and what changes inside becomes outside. Second, a certain part of female reproductive organs is equal to male sexual organs, so it is easier for women to change to men. Conversely, male sexual organs do not contain a degenerative model of female sexual organs, so it is more difficult for men to change to women. This is a common example, and it seems more credible to look at the above examples. Some say that by properly training both sides, after a considerable period, and then using medicine and surgery to correct it, it may be successful. This statement is quite humorous. I wonder what the high opinions of medical experts are.</p>
<h3>Chairman Huang's Wife</h3>
<p>When I was in Nanning, I was walking on the road and saw a woman about forty years old, wearing a floral cloth shirt and pants, without makeup and without a skirt. Her face was completely like a rural woman, or a nanny! Riding a bicycle with a basket hanging on the front of the bike, the basket contained vegetables, fish, and meat. She sped past on the road, and her posture while riding the bike was free and natural. At first glance, she looked like an expert. Pedestrians smiled slightly when they saw her. I inquired and learned that this woman riding a bike to buy groceries was actually the wife of Huang Xuchu, the chairman of Guangxi Province.</p>
<p>It is said that Mrs. Huang and Chairman Huang have a very good relationship. Every day when the chairman goes out, the wife personally sends him to the door, opens the door herself, and closes the door herself. Whenever there are any major ceremonies, the wife also accompanies him, also wearing her usual clothes. Even when it comes to international social events, she wears a long coat at most.</p>
<p>Now, more and more women in Nanning city are riding bicycles every day, and the simple and unadorned clothing of women is greatly influenced by Mrs. Huang. (Wind News)</p>

<h3>Ms. Wang Xiaoying Talks About Women's Liberation</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Ms. Wang Xiaoying, the principal of a Chinese women's middle school, has a considerable reputation in the women's community. She graduated from Beijing Women's Higher Normal School (now Beijing Normal University for Women). From 1923 to the present, she has been engaged in secondary education. Although she once prepared for staff education in the Ministry of Transportation and served as a member of the Legislative Yuan, it was for a short time. She still regards education as her lifelong profession. In China during extraordinary times, women's education is a very important issue, and we should explore it in detail. Therefore, we asked her to express her opinions. That day, Ms. Wang also spoke a lot about women's issues. Here is a summary of her remarks:</p>
<p>The cry of "Women Return to the Family" is loud. Analyzing the reasons they hold, for example: 1. There are too many unemployed people in China; 2. Attention should be paid to the education of children; 3. The past failure of the women's movement is criticized; 4. Reduce men's internal concerns. I can explain these non-reasons. For example, the first point, unemployment is indeed a very serious matter, but women's employment in China is still in its infancy, and the position it occupies is extremely limited. The biggest reason for men's unemployment lies in the oppression of international economic forces, political instability, and the result of rural bankruptcy. It cannot be said that women occupy the position of men. Second, children's education has gradually become popular. Children are in school all day, but they are at home in the morning and evening. Even if the mother is working outside, she is still responsible for education in the morning and evening, and the time does not conflict. Third, any change in a system is bound to have advantages and disadvantages. Not only does women's liberation have drawbacks, but who can guarantee that any revolution will have all benefits and no drawbacks? I think it can only be attributed to policy errors, incomplete methods, or lack of education. It is not the fault of women themselves, and it is not appropriate to give up eating because of choking. As for the fourth point, the small family system is now extremely popular, and the affairs are not complicated. Both parties do not need to spend much energy. Men serve outside, and women can devote their spare strength to public service. In the past, the family economy was entirely the responsibility of men, but it is a great shame for women to rely on men for support for a long time. If women only manage housework, their knowledge is limited, and they do not know the actual situation of society. Therefore, I advocate that women not only fulfill their natural duties to the family, but also fulfill their obligations to mankind. We must gather the mental strength of men and women and work together to increase the strength of national struggle.</p>
<p>"Modern Chinese women are clearly divided into two different lives: urban and rural. Urban women are accustomed to extravagance, and rural women are all diligent. Generally, people who go deep into the people will believe this sentence. Rural women are really able to work hard, and the responsibilities they bear are heavier than men. They only know that women should work, and they do not understand why they should do so. The meaning of life, the cost of work, and nothing else are clear. If we can improve their lives through education and make everyone aware, then the strength of our women will be great. On the other hand, I am a little worried if urban women are partial to enjoyment, regardless of their internal and external natural duties, and do not recognize their own position. Once at Longhua Airport, many fashionable women, dressed in the latest fashion, came to see the take-off and landing of the plane. Mr. Feng Yong asked me: 'What do you see these fashionable women doing every day besides decorating and playing?' It really made people speechless. I think they may not be without knowledge, and they may have received secondary or higher education. The former are people who only do things without understanding, and the latter are people who understand but are unwilling to do things. It should be adjusted. Fortunately, in our country, rural women account for the absolute majority and can represent the spirit of labor. It is here and not there, so to liberate Chinese women, we should start from the countryside."</p>
<p>"In the past ten years, I have presided over the school affairs of four coeducational middle schools, and I am ashamed that I have not learned much. Girls in middle school are very pure in heart and rich in emotions. I have always regarded students as my younger siblings. In terms of administration, I also focus on students and treat teachers as guests. I do everything that is beneficial to students as much as possible, do it thoroughly, and never perfunctorily; I do not do what should not be done, and I apologize to students if I do wrong. Everything is open and fair, and no matter what happens, understanding can lead to a sense of faith. I think it is much more difficult to run a girls' school than a boys' school, and the affairs are much more trivial. In terms of homework, boys who study hard are very hardworking, and the difference between good and bad grades is very large, while girls are mostly on a horizontal line, with no significant differences in height. Girls' physical fitness is not very strong. Sometimes they cannot bear the heavy curriculum and lack the spirit of independent research. Especially in Shanghai, the social and family environment often makes school training feel difficult. For high school graduates, I absolutely advocate seeking their own livelihoods and having the ability to be economically independent. They must not have high-minded ideas."</p>
<p>At this point, the conversation came to an end. Ms. Wang casually wrote down a few sentences, which are simple and comprehensive, and are precisely her central idea for the women's liberation movement.</p>

<h3>Financial Market: Gold Prices Rise Slightly, Transaction Prices Fluctuate Slightly</h3>
<p>Although pure gold prices have risen by 4.5 pence during the gold market closure period, the market conditions have been extremely stagnant, with only 4 jiao fluctuations throughout the day. The result was also good for 4 jiao. It was found that at the beginning of the morning, due to the overseas silver market squeeze during the closure period, the London large bar and New York silver prices were both flat, while the Montry forward silver price narrowed by 8 hao to 4 li. The conversion narrowed slightly, the London raw gold rose by 4.5 pence, the central bank's listed prices were announced, both the UK and the US were flat, the customs gold unit rose by 5 li, and the standard gold price was listed at 1131 yuan. Over-the-counter forward trading opened, rising to 39 yuan. Yuxin Xiangfutai Yong slightly purchased, and Qingfa Yongda Decheng Yuan Maoyong Yicheng sold, retreating to 8 yuan. The morning opening was slightly higher, and after the opening, the activity of the owners was slightly stable, but there were still many sellers taking advantage of the high price. Although the HSBC listed prices for the UK and the US were flat, and the silver balance tax did not move, there was a slight decline, but the fluctuations were extremely small. The large buyers took advantage of the situation to limit purchases, and there were no changes after that. The same was true at noon. The afternoon market was even more sluggish, with only 2 jiao hovering. Yesterday's swap was quoted by multiple parties at 4 yuan. The daily market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1138 yuan 1 jiao, slightly higher than before the closure by 1 jiao. Hongxing Yongda Decheng Tongtai Changda Yuanchun Yuan Yongna rose to 8 yuan 5 jiao. Yuan Mao Yong Qingfa Yong Yuqing Yong Hengyu sold. The HSBC Bank listed prices were announced, both the UK and the US were flat, and the silver balance tax did not move. It gradually dropped to 8 yuan 3 jiao. However, Tongtai Changshun Li took advantage of the low price to purchase bars, and the overall situation was stable. The noon closing was 1138 yuan 3 jiao.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 1138 yuan 3 jiao. Although Fuyu sold, Tongfeng Hengshun Li Lai purchased, rising to 8 yuan 5 jiao. Youfa Yongda Decheng Yuan Mao Yong slightly sold, but because Shunli still bought in, the closing was 1138 yuan 4 jiao. After the closing, Yicheng sold bars, and Shunli still purchased and stabilized.</p>
<p>The settlement price was based on the central bank's standard, and the transaction price was listed, rising to 1131 yuan. According to the closing price, it was raised by more than 7 yuan, which was more than 2 yuan less than before the closure. The registration price for this month was 1134 yuan, and for August it was 1138 yuan. The morning make-up water was 1134 yuan, the same price in the afternoon. The fine gold was increased by 8 yuan to 1146 yuan 1 jiao. The spot market was stable. Tianjin goods were increased by 12 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen, and the fine red was increased by 12 yuan, but there were no sellers. The fine red was increased by 15 yuan 5 fen, and 70 taels were sold by Shengyuan Yong, which were purchased by the silver shop gang. For spot swaps, Shengyuan Yong released 126 bars to Qianchangxiang, and Qianchangxiang transferred them to Shengyuan Yong. The July bar was priced at 1133 yuan. Shengyuan Yong also released 1.8 yuan to Fushun, and the August bar was transferred in. As for July to August, Shengyuan Yong paid Shunmao 35 bars, Yuan Yi 22 bars, and Dachengyuan 14 bars 4 yuan.</p>
<p>The trading volume in the field was limited. In summary, Tongtai Changshun Li Qia Feng Yongda Yuanchun Yuan Yonghong and Yongda Fayong Yuanyi Tongfeng Heng, etc. were on the buying side, while Qingfa Yongwan, Futai Yongda Decheng Yicheng Yuan Maoyong Dingkang Qianchangxiang, etc. were on the selling side.</p>
<p>It was found that the market conditions were sluggish throughout the day. The morning opening was 1138 yuan 1 jiao, and the afternoon closing was 1138 yuan 4 jiao. The highest price was 1138 yuan 5 jiao, and the lowest price was 1138 yuan 1 jiao, with only 4 jiao fluctuations. As a result, it rose slightly by 4 jiao compared to before the closure. There were 1969 bars left in this month's bar, totaling 13 long parties and 9 short parties. The August chip totaled 13,965 bars, totaling 51 long positions and 30 short positions. The total transaction volume was 2,415 bars in the morning and 623 bars in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firms Closing, Banks Releasing Funds: Foreign Exchange Process Generally Peaceful</h3>

<h3>Securities: The 96 Bond Experiences Another Surge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, although the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was closed for two days, the overall situation remained very depressing. Although there was no confirmation of contact at the front lines, preparations at the rear were more hectic than before. The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee was approaching, and there was bound to be a period of extreme unrest and disturbance before and after the session. Therefore, taking action at this time felt uncertain, and it was inevitable that people would be uneasy and the market would fluctuate. However, the 96 Public Bonds, which had ceased principal and interest payments, suddenly experienced an inexplicable surge. Market rumors claimed that the issue would be raised at the Second Plenary Session. However, thinking about it, there was still no solution for the gold portion of the indemnity to Japan, so where would the extra resources come from for this? Moreover, at the end of July, the government would have to pay approximately seventy million in principal and interest on various public bonds, so the 96 bonds were even less likely to be addressed. Each time speculators fabricated rumors, they failed. In this time of financial exhaustion and internal and external troubles, this sudden speculation in the 96 bonds was a more egregious tactic than before. Yesterday, trading was extremely scattered in the morning. Only firm number four bought on the floor, with the remainder being absorbed by small retail investors. Numbers eleven and thirty-five consistently sold, causing both boards to rise by three to six cents. The 96 bonds were bought by numbers four, five, thirty-five, and seventy-seven, also rising by more than half a yuan. In the afternoon, the trend reversed, and rumors circulated again on the floor. All bonds showed a small decline. Class A bonds fell sharply by fifty-five cents. The 96 bonds weakened as large investors released spot holdings, lacking the strength to rise further. At the close, all bonds felt sluggish, declining by another one or two cents. The 96 bonds were heavily supported, managing to rise by only five cents. The final market prices showed Class D bonds rising by forty cents in forward trading, while the rest saw mixed gains and losses, differing by five to ten cents. The 96 bonds experienced a sudden surge of seventy-five cents. The total trading volume was 7.1 million yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Securities Firms Resume Boosting, Yarn Market Rises Again</h3>
<p>All Months Jump Up by 1.56 Yuan</p>
<p>The yarn market trended firmer with a slightly stronger upward momentum. This was largely due to market rumors that circulated widely, suggesting the issuance of circulating currency, which shocked people and sparked buying activity. Market prices rose gradually. At the same time, overseas cotton conditions were favorable. However, short sellers, given the yarn inventories in warehouses, lacked the ability to drive down prices.</p>
<p>Marked Yarn Purchased in Large Quantities by Cheng Kee: The forward market for marked yarn opened with buoyant conditions due to favorable overseas cotton yarn market sentiment and compensatory covering. At the same time, market rumors were rife, all favorable to the long side. In addition, the recent surge in flour and wheat increased buyer interest. Cheng Kee's purchases grew even stronger. As a result, all months rose by eight to nine cents compared to the previous day's closing price. The market atmosphere remained bullish when the afternoon market opened, with most expecting a good performance in US cotton today. Securities firms continued to boost the long side, and market prices rose steadily. As a result, all months rose by six to eight cents compared to the morning closing price. Sales totaled 1,050 bales by Da Feng, 1,250 bales by Ming De, 1,150 bales by Qing Feng, 1,050 bales by Rui Da, 1,550 bales by Shen Ji, 1,050 bales by Xie Cheng, 850 bales by Heng Chang, 1,200 bales by Heng De, 1,500 bales by Ren Feng, and 2,050 bales by Xin Cheng. Purchases totaled 6,600 bales by Cheng Kee, 850 bales by Zhen Da, 1,800 bales by Feng Tai, 800 bales by Yuan Yi, 1,550 bales by Tai Chang, 500 bales by Xin Hua, 1,150 bales by Chang Feng, and 1,100 bales by Da Lun. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Prices Rise for Yarn, Fall for Thread: Spot yarn sales remained good. Statistics showed that various firms bought a total of 905 bales throughout the day, with selling prices rising by one yuan and thread prices falling by two yuan. Sales totaled 700 bales during the two-day market closure. The purchase amounts by various firms are as follows:</p>
<h3>Speculators Pay Attention to New Cotton: Forward Cotton Alone Rises by Forty Cents</h3>
<p>The cotton market saw a downward trend for old cotton, with a very disappointing situation, as the long side of some parties were actively offloading their positions. Generally, there was still no way to promote coarse cotton. However, new cotton rose due to the stimulus of rising overseas cotton prices. However, it was said that multiple domestic cotton fields were being planted, increasing the production volume.</p>
<p>Marked Cotton Falls for Old, Rises for New: The forward market for marked cotton opened with all months rising due to the firmness of the US and Indian cotton markets, with long positions increasing their activity. However, old cotton was exceptionally weak due to the offloading of long positions by financial firms, lacking the momentum to rise. However, speculators bought new cotton. As a result, the end of the month fell by five cents compared to the previous day's closing price, while distant months rose by forty-five cents. When the afternoon market opened, Cheng Kee and securities firms continued to buy, with especially strong buying appetite. However, old cotton was sluggish while new cotton was firm. By the third closing, some dealers sold off positions due to the increased cotton acreage this year, leading to a reversal. As a result, old cotton fell by twenty-five cents compared to the morning closing price, while new cotton remained unchanged. Sales were 2,600 dan by Da Fu, 7,800 dan by Tong Ji, 9,900 dan by Yu Da, 400 dan by Yu Tai, 2,600 dan by Li Tai, 1,500 dan by Heng De, 1,300 dan by Yuan Yi, 8,500 dan by Xin Zheng, 2,300 dan by Yi Kang, 6,900 dan by Chang He, 3,500 dan by He Xing, 2,300 dan by Shen Chang, 4,500 dan by Chang Feng, and 2,000 dan by Tong He. Purchases were 13,200 dan by Cheng Kee, 2,000 dan by Ming De, 7,800 dan by Zhen Da, 7,100 dan by Feng Tai, 3,600 dan by Shen Ji, 1,800 dan by Da Chang Cheng, 1,300 dan by Tai Chang, and 2,800 dan by Run Kang. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Factory Sales are Flat: Spot cotton sales are mediocre, with stagnant factory sales. 1,850 bales of Yao cotton were sourced.</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 58.2 Ugliness, Nihua Factory Imports 101 Pieces, Spot Delivered to Factory</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 58.00, Domestic and Foreign Factory Imports 66 Pieces, Ditto</p>
<p>Nanyuan Cotton 61.10, Dacheng Factory Imports 119 Pieces, Ditto</p>
<h3>No Changes in Grade for December Term Yarn and Cotton This Year</h3>
<p>Special margin of 3 yuan per dan collected for cotton this month</p>
<p>The Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange convened a cotton yarn appraisal meeting on June 27 to discuss the grades of 10-count, 16-count, and 20-count cotton yarn for delivery in the December term of this year. The result was that all grades were the same as in the November term, with no changes. Furthermore, the cotton appraisal meeting also determined that the unginned cotton grade was the same as in the November term, with no changes. A special margin of 3 yuan in cash per dan will be collected for new trades made in the June-July term marked cotton starting from the 3rd, with accounts being charged on both sides.</p>
<h3>Contraction of Long-Short Positions in Marked Yarn</h3>
<p>The amount of margin deposits for forward marked yarn at this city's Yarn and Cloth Exchange as of the end of June was slightly less than the previous month. Trading volume for the July term was 82,450 bales, for the August term it was 141,900 bales, for the September term it was 159,400 bales, for the October term it was 171,000 bales, and for the November term it was 75,450 bales, totaling 643,000 bales. This was a decrease of 26,700 bales compared to 669,700 bales in the previous month. The net margin deposit after offsetting long and short positions was 119,100 bales, with financial circles, gold merchants, and securities brokers accounting for the majority of the long side, and industry peers and scattered speculators on the short side. The largest buyers and sellers are listed below for reference (unit: bales).</p>
<p>Longs Liquidating</p>
<h3>US Cotton Initially Rises Then Retreats</h3>
<p>Indian Cotton Market Prices Are Very Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened with gains of 3 to 8 points for all months. News from Liverpool was good, and industry players and foreign firms bought. Spot goods were tight, and demand for textiles was active. Although there was rainfall in the central and eastern cotton regions, it was not enough to stop the rise. The Cotton Loan Corporation sold 10,000 bales of October term cotton in the New Orleans market when it reached 11.18 cents. It was reported that the Cotton Loan Corporation denied selling spot cotton to a certain spot dealer and also reported that 1,000 bales of Brazilian cotton were competing with US cotton. Afterwards, industry players hesitated to advance, and longs liquidated positions, causing the market to retreat slightly. Spot prices rose by 1 point, while futures prices rose by 1-2 points. British cotton spot prices rose by 12 points, and futures prices rose by 13-14 points. Indian cotton was firm as Japanese firms and futures traders bought, with Pingguo Er rising by 2.75 to 3.5 rupees, Aomula rising by 1.25 to 2.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi rising by 3.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated the 2nd).</p>
<p>According to a Bombay telegram dated the 3rd, the forecast for the April-May term Bailuoxi cotton was 215 rupees, down 1.25 rupees from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Sanpin Yarn and Cotton Soften</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from Osaka on the 3rd, Sanpin term yarn fell by 0.6 to 1.1 yuan, with near months at 205.5 yuan and distant months at 199.8 yuan. Term cotton fell by 0.15 to 0.35 yuan, with near months at 66.85 yuan and distant months at 62.7 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Futures Halted</h3>
<p>Due to Insufficient Margin Calls</p>
<p>Wheat futures were also halted for trading and moved to spot transactions, which still showed stability and firmness. However, no transactions were seen in the southern market. Only northern brokers directly matched with factories, opening with over 10,000 bags. Market prices rose by another 0.2-0.3 yuan. Opening prices were 4.37 yuan for postal wheat from Kaifeng, 4.33 yuan for secondary wheat, 4.33 yuan for Jiangbei wheat, 4.30 yuan for Danyang wheat, 4.25-4.26 yuan for Gaozi wheat, 4.27 yuan for Shaobo wheat, 4.22 yuan for Yangzhou wheat, 4.21-4.22 yuan for Guazhou wheat, 4.22 yuan for Zhenjiang wheat and 4.20 yuan for secondary wheat, 4.27 yuan for Nanjing wheat, 4.27 yuan for Huaian wheat, 4.23 yuan for Kunshan wheat and 3.98 yuan for secondary wheat, 4.15 yuan for Changshu wheat and around 4.10 yuan for Penglai wheat. A total of over 10,000 bags were said to have been purchased by Fuxin.</p>
<p>Due to soaring market prices, the issue of margin calls at the Flour and Sundries Exchange has not yet been resolved. Therefore, both the upper and lower markets were not opened for trading. Whether trading resumes will depend on whether the margin calls can be met. This is said to be a prerequisite.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was no market for flour futures due to the trading halt. It was heard that spot flour merchants were quite active, with spot prices for both Army Ship and Old Car brands opening at 3.10 yuan. Transactions through the exchange were said to be subject to an additional 0.05 yuan, and Shuangma flour was at 3.06 yuan.</p>
<p>Trading in soybean oil, soybean cakes, sesame, etc., was halted yesterday. Because the margin calls for wheat had not been met, trading was suspended for a day to allow brokers to submit their margin payments. It was said that trading in soybean oil, etc., was halted as a consequence.</p>
<p>The drought in the US wheat region has not improved significantly, and the outcome of the Canadian wheat harvest is uncertain, causing panic. As a result, short sellers have made large-scale covering purchases. Farmers are not selling their stockpiles, so hedging is scarce. The Paine Webber Company estimates the winter wheat production at 521 million bushels and the spring wheat production at 132 million bushels. The remaining estimates will be released tomorrow. The US Department of Agriculture estimates global carryover at 62.5 million bushels, of which the US carryover is 12.5 million bushels. In comparison, global carryover last year was 86.5 million bushels, of which the US carryover was 15.2 million bushels. Starting tomorrow, the daily price fluctuation limit for Canadian wheat will be set at 5 cents.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat (July 1st) (July 2nd) (Change)</p>
<p>September 97.00 102.00 Up 5.00</p>
<p>December 98.50 103.50 Up 5.00</p>
<p>Canadian Wheat (July 1st) (July 2nd) (Change)</p>

<h3>Thin Rice Sales Still Brisk to the North</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday's deliveries from various firms totaled over 20, with a total of over 4,000 shih of goods. Sales in this district slightly improved, with merchants from Dalian and Qingdao jointly purchasing over 1,000 bags, resulting in a tight situation. Market conditions were showing firmness, with prices for thick early japonica rice rising by 0.05 to 0.10 yuan, while thin rice recovered by several cents. Du Yangjian and Yinbian Yuan remained firm.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday's deliveries from various areas downstream were not strong, with approximately 10 firms. Market demand for various goods was normal due to the inconsistent weather. Spot prices for high-quality white japonica rice remained stable, while medium-quality rice showed a slightly stable trend. Prices for white yuan and thin rice did not change, while Yangbu Jian rice was weak, falling by 0.03-0.05 yuan. The prices of other goods were similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Activity Improves Slightly for Hakka Sen Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the weakness in Hakka Sen rice eased, and prices for various types of rice stabilized. Although deliveries continued steadily, the volume was not strong, and spot and secondary rice had already fallen by more than 0.50 yuan since the festival. Inquiries from inland regions and this district had slightly increased, and sellers were unwilling to lower prices further due to cost considerations. Therefore, sales improved slightly in yesterday's market, and prices also recovered. The entire city saw over 1,000 bags of medium-quality Jiangxi rice purchased by inland merchants. The remainder was sold within this district, with a total of 5,545 bags of Jiangxi rice, 250 bags of Hunan rice, and 240 bags of Futai rice sold. Prices were similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Dongyang Piece Goods Rise Repeatedly</h3>
<p>Affected by the sharp rise in US cotton and Sanpin yarn and cotton, the daily cotton cloth market has seen a strong increase in confidence among Japanese firms and factories. It is reported that the Dongyang Company opened more than 1,000 pieces of white goods for the current month and the August-September term the day before yesterday. Including the monthly seconds and single-day openings, the total number has reached more than 3,000 pieces, with fine cloth and fine twill being the largest. The company's prices rose by 0.05 yuan the day before yesterday and another 0.05 yuan yesterday, causing the market prices to increase sharply. Yesterday, the price increased again by 0.025 yuan. Dyeing factories made the most purchases. Foreign factories old and new flowers, straight tributes, serge, crepe, satin, and printed cloth of oriental goods were also said to have a large opening of more than 1,000 pieces. The largest purchases were made in this street. Customers in the northern routes of Tianjin and other gangs made small purchases. Local factories offered sales of clear water bleached cloth, line tweed, light and heavy weight coarse cloth, coarse twill, with heavyweight goods being more firm and expensive. Yantai and Qingdao gangs only purchased limited amounts of pigmented serge and various brands of line tweed. The southern routes of Guangdong and Guangxi were the quietest. The Sichuan route, Chongqing and Wanxian gangs, still had a good intake. Pigmented serge, straight tribute and Zhuang Qing blue-gray twill produced by local and foreign factories, and blue and white cloths from Dacheng and other factories continued to see a surge in transactions. Yunnan is also gradually showing improvement, with the demand for white goods waning, while the demand for colored goods such as pigmented tributes, serge, stripe tweed, and blue cloth is increasing.</p>
<h3>Autumn Goods, Woolen Cloth, Sichuan Gang Has Already Made Inquiries</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Sichuan gang stationed in Shanghai, such as Dachuantong, Yiji, Taiguyu, Zhichangxiang, Xiangyugong, Jifuli, Juyuanfang, Xiejichang, Huijichang, and other customers, requested samples of autumn-selling suits, flower tweed, wide and narrow plain fabric, camel hair, plain tribute material, assorted plain serge, Hailing Peng medium-thick serge, etc. It is said that formal transactions still require considerable negotiation, but according to past years' habits, gangs from Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan make purchases earlier than other customer gangs due to the long distances involved. Therefore, the period for taking action is expected to be not far off.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Markets Decline Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the New York raw silk market was quite sluggish, with both Japanese and Chinese silk falling by 3 cents per pound. Spot and futures prices were all lower than the previous day by 1 cent. In the Lyon silk market, Shanghai Silk B and Japanese silk remained unchanged, while Shanghai Silk A and Guangdong silk fell by 1 franc each. The Yokohama silk market was also unfavorable, with spot prices falling by 13 yuan and futures prices falling by 9 yuan. Sales of Shanghai silk were therefore lackluster, the silk market was lean, and user silk transactions were also sparse.</p>
<h3>Rayon Trading Slightly Brisk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of Rayon...light 30... was 115 yuan, excluding tax. The price of the 120 Heavenly Horse brand fell by several yuan, with 20 cases traded at a price of 405 yuan. A certain local firm opened 50 cases of 450-count warehouse receipts from the Sino-German Changfang at 80 yuan. Yesterday's Italian auction sold 2 cases, one being 300-count Japanese goods and the other being 150-count goods from Tomai Takafuku Factory, at prices of 377 yuan and 373 yuan respectively. There were no 150-count Heavenly Horse brand goods available.</p>
<h3>Italian Silk Being Dumped at Low Prices; European Silk Exports to the US Surge in June</h3>
<p>Nearly Four Times the Usual Amount</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch yesterday, New York raw silk inventory statistics showed that the number of raw silk sales in the United States in June decreased significantly. Total sales in June were 31,438 bales, a decrease of 649 bales from the previous month and a sharp decrease of approximately 2,000 bales from the same month last year. However, European silk exports to the US in June surged, which was rare in recent years. This was because Italian silk was affected by sanctions and could not be sold to Britain and France, so it was dumped in the US at low prices. Therefore, the number of exports to the US was nearly four times the usual amount. At the same time, the shipment of Chinese silk to the United States decreased by 257 bales. The market conditions of various silk products in the US are listed below.</p>
<h3>More Than 54,000 Boxes of Black Tea Sold</h3>
<p>Since the start of this year's black tea season, sales have been very brisk. As of now, 40,500 boxes of Keemun black tea, Yihong black tea, Qihong black tea, and Zhided black tea have been sold. 6,490 boxes of Anhui black tea and 7,667 boxes of Flower Fragrance tea have been sold, totaling more than 54,000 boxes.</p>
<h3>Ping-shui Large Firms Begin to Move for US Sales</h3>
<p>North Fengmei Quoted at 61 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for black and green tea at foreign firms became active again, with a total of more than 4,700 boxes of black and green tea traded in the city. Among them, the Ping-shui large firms are starting to move for US sales, with firms such as Hua Hua and Jinlong having already started trading, with opening prices of 39 to 42.5 yuan. In addition, Tunzhen tea sales remained lackluster. Tun Zhen Mei from Xiehe and Baolong had a combined price of 82 to 85 yuan. Jinlong purchased dozens of boxes of North eyebrow tea, with opening prices of 61-62 yuan. Yihe, Jinlong, and Tianyu each purchased Needle eyebrow tea, with prices ranging from 50 to 73 yuan. Fushi and Xiehe both had transactions for Weizhen tea, with prices ranging from 71 to 82 yuan. Yushan, Yanxi, and Yulong began trading, with prices of 19 and 20 yuan. Yushan Yuyuan tea was sold at 56 yuan yesterday, while transactions for other types of Zhen Mei tea were extremely sluggish. Yihe and Jinlong and other firms purchased large quantities of Qihong black tea, and the market was quite stable.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: New Dried Lychees Will Be Released Soon</h3>
<p>New lychees, Qianbai, Dachao, Shuidong, and Haikou branches have already arrived in three or four batches. There are also early red and Wulai branches from Guangdong and the mountain...seeing goods at...The opening from... is more, which still needs to be opened later to avoid...Market conditions have all shown signs of softening.</p>
<h3>Xiamen Tangerine Peel Candies New Goods Open</h3>
<p>The 20 barrels of Xiamen tangerine peel candies that arrived the day before yesterday were sampled yesterday. The quality is still good, but the color is uneven, with uneven sales. Therefore, the firm wants to increase the price by 1 yuan, but it will not be possible. The buyer should find a compromise. If higher quality goods arrive in the next batch, it may be slightly increased.</p>
<h3>Fennel Is Still in the Transition Between Old and New Crops</h3>
<p>Fennel has recently seen a shortage in supply and inventory, and the new crop is still more than a month away, so the trend is very tight. A new sea fennel was opened at 29 yuan, but there was no further opening. Yesterday, Nanning goods were offered at 31 yuan and Beihai goods at 30 yuan, but neither were traded.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: White and Red Sugar Prices Rise by 0.5-0.6 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trends for Dutch White and other sugars remained flat. However, the price of domestic red sugar rose due to continued tight production prices and gradually increasing sales. The association opened spot prices for No. 24 coarse white sugar at 22.1 yuan, Haikou goods at 6.75 yuan, and Dongbai Nos. 4, 8, and 9 all at the original price. However, No. 8 YT mark spot goods were traded at 21.4 yuan. Local factory refined white sugar also saw no change. There was a...opening of 1,800 bags of domestic red sand, including...Bang opened by Da...and...Profit and other 470... 13.1, 13.2, 13.3 yuan, and 1.3 yuan, and Hua Guang Shu Xing He Xing and other 150 bags, 12.67 to 12.2 yuan, up 0.5-0.6 yuan. Guang Xiang Bang opened over 600 bags of Hainan red at 11.7 yuan, up 0.2 yuan. Also, An red more than 100 bags, 12.3 to 12.5 yuan, Huizhou red more than 200 bags, 11.7 yuan, Huizhou white more than 100 bags, 17.3 yuan. Hua Bang Gao Jing red more than 100 bags, 12 yuan, and Da Fen white more than 60 bags, 17.8 yuan.</p>
<p>Hehe Company was the third bidding period this week, with a total quota of 8,083 bags of Guangdong coarse white and refined white sugar. Bidding prices were as before, and the transaction volume slightly increased. 400 bags of Wuyang coarse white sugar from Shunde Factory were successfully exchanged at 31.6 yuan, 1,566 bags from Dongguan Factory at 21.5 yuan, 230 bags from Shixin Factory at 21.6 yuan, 10 bags of Zhongsha White at 19.3 yuan, 312 bags of No. 3 refined white at 20.6 yuan, and 10 bags of No. 4 again at 20.4 yuan. The original price for Qu Xi Factory's White failed to be reached.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: New Haikou Tree Rubber Rises by 1.5 Yuan</h3>
<p>The first batch of new Haikou tree rubber (i.e., raw material for rubber overshoes) has arrived in several pieces and has already been exchanged. Although it is not the peak sales season, the market is extremely short, so the opening price has not softened, but has instead trended firmer. Yesterday, the opening firm continued to arrive at 12 pieces of new tree rubber, and the quality was still good. It should open at 56.5 yuan, up 3.5 yuan from the first market.</p>

<h3>Infectious Venereal Diseases, i.e., Sexually Transmitted Diseases (Continued 3)</h3>
<p>— Yao Erchang, MD, Benxue Weni University, USA</p>
<p>(Gonorrhea) Besides unclean sexual intercourse, gonorrhea of course has other ways to spread. For example, gonorrhea in children is mostly caused by... In addition, public towels that are contaminated with gonorrhea, or gonorrhea patients who do not know how to clean, unintentionally make their fingers contaminated with gonorrhea, and spread it to the eyes of others, will also cause gonorrheal purulent eyes. However, the chance of this type of gonorrhea transmission is very small.</p>
<p>"Acute Gonorrhea" - Gonorrhea can be divided into two types according to its symptoms: acute gonorrhea and chronic gonorrhea. The symptoms of acute gonorrhea usually appear two to three days or four to five days after unclean sexual intercourse. Men experience itching, pain, and burning sensations in the urethra when urinating. The penis often erects, and there may be nocturnal emission at night. In the morning, there is a small amount of mucus and swelling and redness at the external urethral opening. However, at this time, some people think that this is a reaction to too much nocturnal emission, and some people think that the semen has not been completely discharged because the semen was held back during sexual intercourse, so this phenomenon occurs. Therefore, some people let it go naturally, and some people hide it, hoping that it will slowly return to its original state. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Perils of White Turbidity Variations</h3>
<p>— (Previous Writer)</p>
<p>Causes of Extinction and Sterility - Effective Radical Cure Methods</p>
<p>The pathology and treatment of white turbidity have been repeatedly and thoroughly clarified in this publication. Now, we will further explore the variations of white turbidity to provide a clearer understanding for those who pay attention to this issue.</p>
<p>Variations of white turbidity are all ominous. Mild cases result in loss of health and extinction of offspring, while severe cases lead to disability and death. Examples include the burning sensation and frequent urination of posterior urethritis, the swelling and pain of epididymitis, the high fever and bloody urine of cystitis, the lower back pain and inflammation of nephritis, and the bone pain and disability of arthritis. Other conditions, such as the sterility caused by seminal duct inflammation and prostatitis, and the life-threatening dangers of uterine inflammation and peritonitis, must be treated promptly.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the most effective treatment for white turbidity in the medical community has been injections of yellow pigment. However, yellow pigment injections can cause inflammation and other side effects. European and American medical circles have been racking their brains and conducting extensive research, finally inventing an oral yellow pigment preparation called Antirrhea. Taking it has similar effects to injecting yellow pigment, without any other side effects. Therefore, the European and American medical communities unanimously praise it as the most recent unique and effective radical cure for gonorrhea. I have also repeatedly used it in clinical practice to cure male and female gonorrhea, leukorrhea caused by gonorrhea, and various ominous variations caused by gonorrhea, with repeatedly proven effects and supreme satisfaction. It is by no means comparable to inferior drugs that only kill bacteria in the urine.</p>
<h3>Self-Indulgence and Nocturnal Emission Weaken the Body</h3>
<p>— Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission is mostly caused by recent self-indulgence and a weakened body. Patients have relaxed seminal vesicles and ejaculate prematurely. Therefore, the treatment should first focus on strengthening the semen. However, if the deficiency is not replenished, it will not be enough to achieve a radical cure, and there is a risk of recurrence.</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Ni indulged in bad habits in his youth, leading to nocturnal emission. He had been treated by doctors repeatedly, but without a radical cure. This spring, his nocturnal emission increased drastically, causing insomnia and forgetfulness, and a myriad of ailments. He then sought treatment from me. I inquired about his previous treatments, which were either biased towards strengthening or replenishing. I then prescribed "Reproduction Element" and "Hemitol Semen-Strengthening Pills" to be purchased at the Taihe Pharmacy. After taking less than two boxes, the effects were immediately apparent. After taking several boxes consecutively, the nocturnal emission was completely eradicated, and his body quickly regained its strength. He left cheerfully, expressing his gratitude.</p>
<h3>Can Killing Bacteria in Urine Cure Gonorrhea?</h3>
<p>— Physician Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>Before the invention of the oral yellow pigment preparation "Antirrhea," although injecting yellow pigment had side effects such as causing inflammation and pigment deposition, there was no better treatment at the time. Therefore, both the medical and pharmaceutical communities had to adopt the idea of "in the absence of a great general in Shu, Liao Hua acts as the vanguard" and apply it. After the emergence of the oral yellow pigment preparation "Antirrhea," they abandoned the short and took the long, discarding the dross and taking the essence, and used it orally. It had similar effects to injecting yellow pigment, without all its side effects. It swept away the long-standing dull problem. Therefore, the European and American medical and pharmaceutical communities regard "Antirrhea" as the authority for radically curing white turbidity, and doctors from various countries in the East and West widely use it. Since its widespread use, it has saved no less than a million cases of acute, chronic, new, and stubborn gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Initially, general partial-effect treatments focused on "killing bacteria in the urine" as sufficient to treat gonorrhea. This statement is utterly wrong and pitiful. Given the virulence of gonococci, which invade the human body in every possible way, how can local sterilization of urine be enough to boast of being an effective treatment?</p>
<p>The special effect of "Antirrhea" lies in its pure and benign medicinal properties, which are suitable for the constitutions of various Chinese people. After taking it, the medicinal power directly reaches the affected area and penetrates deep into the lesion. Wherever gonococci have left their traces, it follows them closely, like a cat catching a mouse, or a shadow following a form, killing bacteria through the membrane, like mercury spilling on the ground, leaving no empty space unentered. It not only has the effect of killing bacteria in the urine, but also more.</p>
<p>There are also many cheap medications, mainly based on old drugs such as sandalwood oil, or mixed with domineering drugs, collecting the poison inward and turning acute into chronic, so that patients see the effect in front of them and sell their deceptive toxic schemes, delaying the disease. This is by no means shallow. Gonorrhea has many dangerous variations, such as epididymitis, prostatitis, pyelonephritis, seminal duct inflammation, etc., all of which belong to internal delicate tissues. The medicinal power must directly reach the affected part to be effective, unlike urethritis and cystitis, which can rely on killing bacteria in the urine to achieve only a part of the effect.</p>
<p>The function of "Antirrhea" is truly valuable in reducing inflammation and swelling, preventing corrosion and promoting regeneration, calming spasm and relieving pain, and promoting diuresis and clearing turbidity. It not only kills bacteria through the membrane, but also more. Therefore, its ability to completely cure turbidity and radically treat the disease is far beyond what other drugs can achieve.</p>
<h3>Stroke Emergency - Depends on Daily Prevention</h3>
<p>— Physician Liu Zhimin</p>
<p>Stroke warning signs are in limb numbness. Limb numbness originates in bone disease. The danger of stroke lies in blood vessel rupture. The root cause is based on arteriosclerosis.</p>
<p>Stroke is not unique to obese patients, but obese people are more likely to suffer from it. Therefore, people often mistakenly think that if they are not obese, they are safe and secure. Even if there are various warning signs, they are still indifferent to prevention. One day they suddenly collapse, helpless and unable to be rescued.</p>
<p>The onset of this disease is gradual. There are three origins: 1. Wind-damp invasion. 2. Residual toxins accumulate internally. 3. Physical weakness. The first two often lead to unclean blood and excessive uric acid, which can cause arteriosclerosis and increase the risk of stroke. The latter lacks gonadal hormones, and blood vessels lose nutrition and cannot prevent hardening. Therefore, the treatment of this disease lies entirely in prevention. If you are anxious at the last minute, it is extremely difficult to save.</p>
<p>Patients initially feel bone pain, which is followed by limb numbness, and eventually arteriosclerosis forms. Therefore, the most urgent task in prevention is to treat bone pain and limb numbness, and it is also urgent to take gonadal hormone preparations to ensure that blood vessels are nourished and maintain their elasticity. Moreover, gonadal hormones have the function of preventing poisoning and increasing resistance, so they are essential for patients with bone pain and limb numbness.</p>
<p>The famous bone pain drug "Strong's Bone Pain Pills" can radically cure bone pain, limb numbness and other symptoms. Its function is not only to remove dampness and search for toxins, but also to relieve acid and inflammation, eliminate uric acid, and restore the excretory function to normal. If taken at the same time as the gonadal hormone preparation "Reproduction Element," it will have the function of nourishing the whole body, softening blood vessels, increasing resistance, and preventing poisoning. Therefore, for those who understand that bone pain and limb numbness are warning signs of stroke and want to prevent them, these two drugs are indeed essential for the right symptoms.</p>
<p>As for bone pain variations such as muscle cramps, muscle soreness, hemiplegia, and quadriplegia, it will be useless without taking "Strong's Bone Pain Pills."</p>
<p>Sexually Transmitted Disease Lecture</p>
<p>— Compiled by Physician Zhan Nian and Dr. Yao Erchang</p>
<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Corner of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road, Shanghai (Outpatient) 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM - Closed on Sundays</p>
<p>(1) Sexual Impotence, Sexual Weakness, and Difficulty in Having Children</p>
<p>Sexual neurasthenia has various symptoms, such as nocturnal emission, wet dreams, sexual impotence, sexual weakness, and kidney failure. Patients have gonadal decline and lack gonadal hormones, resulting in weak performance and difficulty in having children. Symptomatic treatment, in addition to abstinence and health preservation, should be based on gonadal hormone preparations, which are not comparable to ordinary preparations.</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Mi was inherently weak and sickly from a young age. He failed to recuperate and could not recover. His development was incomplete, and he could not enjoy health. After marriage, he was harmed by excessive sexual activity, leading to performance decline. He suffered from sexual impotence and kidney failure one after another. He delayed treatment and procrastinated for many years. He has been married for many years without any children. He only came for consultation last winter. In addition to electrotherapy, I prescribed medication based on his symptoms and instructed him to purchase iron-boxed, newly packaged "Reproduction Element" from the Yong'an Company Pharmacy to treat his sexual disease and replenish his deficiencies. After taking half a dozen, his health improved, and he had further development. His vitality was reborn, and he had hope for offspring. Indeed, Mr. Mi came to the clinic last month to thank me, saying that his wife had happily announced her pregnancy.</p>
<p>(2) Nocturnal Emission, Wet Dreams, Thin Semen, and Weak Brain</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission is most common among young people. Most patients who come for consultation have suffered from it. If the treatment is not appropriate, it is impossible to cure it radically. The general view is that this disease can be effectively treated by simply replenishing it. In fact, this is wrong. The pathology of this disease lies in the relaxation of the vas deferens. The treatment should first focus on strengthening the semen. As for the bitterness, dryness, and thinness of the semen, and the weakness of the brain, ordinary tonics cannot be effective. The origin of thin semen and weak brain lies in gonadal decline and lack of gonadal hormones. What else can be sought for symptomatic treatment other than gonadal hormone preparations?</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Liu indulged in self-indulgence in his youth, leading to nocturnal emission. The number of discharges increased frequently, and his essence was greatly depleted, becoming cold, thin, and exhausted. His brain lost its nourishment, causing insomnia, forgetfulness, dizziness, and blurred vision. He took tonics repeatedly, but without any effect. This spring, because he was about to get married, he was accompanied by his close relatives to seek treatment. I adopted a treatment that combined treatment and replenishment, and instructed him to purchase "Hemitol Semen-Strengthening Pills" from the Sino-British Pharmacy to treat his nocturnal emission, and "Reproduction Element" to replenish his essence and strengthen his brain. After taking it for a month, his nocturnal emission was cured, his essence was sufficient, his brain was nourished, his body developed, and he regained his health.</p>
<h3>Case Studies from the Venereal Disease and Smoking Cessation Clinic</h3>
<p>— Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine, University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>White Turbidity, Burning Sensation in Urine, Leukorrhea, and Breast Atrophy</p>
<p>(Patients) Mr. and Mrs. Zheng, both around thirty years old, from Zhejiang Province, are merchants. (Chief complaint) The husband suffers from white turbidity, burning sensation in urine, and frequent urination. The wife suffers from leukorrhea, dysmenorrhea, and breast atrophy. (Medical history) Mr. Zheng had improper relations during his youth, leading to gonorrhea. He mistakenly took inferior medicine, which seemed effective on the surface, but actually collected the poison inward. He often relapsed after drinking and working. He mistakenly tried package treatment, but it was not radically cured. He spent a lot of money and time, and suffered heavy losses. After marriage, his wife was infected and suffered from leukorrhea, dysmenorrhea, etc. Her breasts atrophied, losing health and beauty. They have been married for six years without any children. They only came for treatment this spring. (Treatment) I instructed them to purchase the famous gonorrheal special medicine, the oral yellow pigment preparation "Antirrhea," from the Taihe Pharmacy to treat their white turbidity and gonorrheal leukorrhea, and to use "Therapeutic Bandage" externally to remove inflammation and strangulation. They were also prescribed "Reproduction Element" for men and women separately to restore their vitality and performance and cure Mrs. Zheng's menstrual irregularities, uterine inflammation, abdominal pain, and breast atrophy. After taking it for a month, their urine became clear and pure, and the couple was cured together. Mrs. Zheng's chest developed and her breasts became full, fully expressing the beauty that a young woman should have.</p>
<p>Bone Pain, Limb Numbness, and Safe Smoking Cessation</p>
<p>(Patient) Mr. Zhou, 42 years old, local, occupation unknown. (Chief complaint) Sore joints, numbness in the limbs, restlessness when quitting smoking, and quitting halfway. (Medical history) Mr. Zhou suffered from rheumatism in his youth and was not cured. It accumulated internally and entered the bones, causing soreness and pain. Later, he became addicted to smoking in a friend's house to refresh himself. Addiction is a painful disease, and it is difficult to quit. Last year, the government's ban was strict, so he tried to quit. He quit three times before, but stopped halfway because of frequent soreness and pain and mental depression. This spring, he saw his housemate Mr. Shi's smoking addiction safely quit by me using "Reproduction Element" and other methods, so he asked him to introduce him to quit. (Treatment) I diagnosed that Mr. Zhou had excessive uric acid and numbness had formed in his limbs. I immediately instructed him to purchase the famous drug "Strong's Bone Pain Pills" from the Sino-Western Pharmacy to radically cure it. His joints felt comfortable and his limbs became more active. I then prescribed the famous tonic "Reproduction Element" to safely quit smoking. Because Mr. Zhou urgently wanted to shorten the quitting period for certain matters, I also injected him with "Yu Wei Ci Bao Ming" at the same time. The medicine and injections complemented each other. It is estimated that the quitting period was reduced by one-third.</p>

<h3>Hot Water is Also Going Up in Price</h3>
<p>— Home Is</p>
<p>It won't be long before pork and tofu in Shanghai have also increased in price one after another. Everyone knows that pork in China is the most common type of meat food; and tofu is precisely the most common, cheap, and nutritious vegetarian food for the Chinese people throughout history. However, they have both increased in price. The reason for their price increase is that the demand for pork exceeds the supply, because the demand for pork in Shanghai has been increasing year by year, but the supply from pork production areas is insufficient due to transportation and various inconveniences, so the price of pork has risen. Therefore, pork merchants have no choice but to implement price increases to offset costs and indirectly reduce the amount of purchases on the demand side. As for tofu, everyone knows that its raw material is soybeans, and most of the soybean production is in our northeastern provinces. However, for more than four years, the soybean production areas have long been occupied by the enemy, and this large output has also been used by the enemy as raw materials for various military needs to prepare for aggression, so the supply of soybeans to various parts of our country has been interrupted. Finally, tofu merchants raised prices after a three-day strike of their industry's public consultation. However, their price increase has added another layer of burden to the daily lives of ordinary people, especially the working masses at the lower levels.</p>
<p>But, following the price increase of pork and tofu, it is said that the hot water industry, commonly known as "tiger stove," is also implementing price increases. The reason is that there are too many "tiger stove" operators in Shanghai, and business competition is inevitable; so today, under the planning of their industry association, they are preparing to increase prices with a uniform price. However, this price increase of hot water has again added weight to the burden of ordinary people's lives, which is beyond doubt. Who doesn't know that water, along with air, is an indispensable resource for human life every day. And the "tiger stove" in Shanghai has a very close relationship with the daily drinks of the lower and middle classes. Although their transactions are mostly very small amounts such as five or ten copper coins, they are indispensable to the lives of ordinary people every day! Especially in this hot summer. However, it - hot water also has to increase in price.</p>
<p>However, what makes people anxious is that the price increase of these daily necessities - pork, tofu, hot water, etc. - is happening precisely in today's social state of poverty and exhaustion of wealth, with unrest, panic, and recession everywhere: the general prices of goods are following the influx of foreign goods and falling into an unlimited state of competitive sale, and they are falling sharply one after another; however, the purchasing power of the general public is also falling day by day with unemployment? Poverty, and even all kinds of panic... Therefore, the repeated price increases of these daily food materials not only intensify the oppression of the lives of ordinary people, but also directly and indirectly accelerate the unrest and death of the general lower classes.</p>
<p>However, who can deny that there is a certain result for a certain cause, and this result is also the cause of another result. If we want to survive and seek improvement, we must thoroughly look for the root cause.</p>
<h3>Windmill</h3>
<p>— Wang Ci</p>
<p>My second uncle, whose face was thin and narrow like that of a weak scholar, who had actually been a farmer for twelve years, rushed into my house in the twilight, shouting in his mouth:</p>
<p>"Wu Guan, Wu Guan!"</p>
<p>I turned around, a familiar face lingered with melancholy: suddenly anxious, frustrated posture:</p>
<p>"Second uncle, what's wrong?"</p>
<p>Second uncle circled his right index finger, as if drawing a symbol in the air!</p>
<p>"Wu Guan, that, that windmill brother, is haunted! Three days ago, it was like a piece of iron, not moving at all..."</p>
<p>He looked at me, as if with some resentment towards me, resenting that I shouldn't have encouraged him to sell the cow and start this disobedient monster: such a huge windmill.</p>
<p>"Still that cow, alas, I can't forget that loyal cow,"</p>
<p>Second uncle likes to bend the index finger of his left hand and put it in his mouth to bite when he is panicked. His lips move. When he wants to speak, he takes out his index finger:</p>
<p>"The day before yesterday, the first day the Lan car stopped, I thought it was because the wind was slight - the big-leaved tree on the southeast corner covered the wind that should have blown over, at that time, I hated it, um um, I hated it. I called my third brother, took the saw, and sawed the big-leaved tree down at once. But, Wu Guan Wu Guan, after the big-leaved tree was sawn down, the windmill was still standing still, there was really a ghost playing around..."</p>
<p>"The seedlings in the field are showing signs of withering, the next day, the water in the depression will dry up. I look at the seventeen mu of seedlings that are just planted, I'm really sad, I'm really sad!"</p>
<p>"Who knows: we waited for the windmill to turn, waited until three o'clock, the windmill still didn't move, looking at other people's, it was spinning around... I thought, my life is not good, I thought of that cow, that cow..."</p>
<p>"Early this morning, Taoist Huang walked past the road, he said: 'The Land Lord is angry, it's time to make some noise', so, at noon I invited him to come and chant a few words, that's five coins, Taoist Huang said: 'Today,</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>At the time of Shen, the windmill will move.' Wu Guan Wu Guan, look, it's still not moving, it's like iron!"</p>
<p>Second uncle pointed to the window - the windmill was like two crossed black eagles, spreading its wings, not moving at all.</p>
<p>I picked up that short shirt, put it on, and stood up.</p>
<p>"Second uncle, come! Let me go see,"</p>
<p>In the hazy blue color, I stepped on the road to the field with second uncle. In second uncle's field, many dry cracks had already occurred. Second uncle said:</p>
<p>"Wu Guan! Look: I'm sad, I'm sad."</p>
<p>Walking there, second aunt was sitting on the axle, shedding tears, muttering in her mouth:</p>
<p>"You shouldn't have sold that cow, that cow..."</p>
<p>Looking at the wind, the wind was blowing gently, the direction of the windmill was facing northwest, the wind was blowing a true east wind, I said:</p>
<p>"Second uncle, you should move the windmill a little bit,"</p>
<p>"Second uncle, you should lower the awning a little bit -"</p>
<p>Second uncle listened to the words, and together with me, moved the windmill in one direction, and then put the awning a little slant, in an instant, second aunt sitting on the vehicle somersaulted and fell into the woodpile:</p>
<p>"Help! Help!" Second aunt shouted.</p>
<p>I dragged second aunt up, second aunt's forehead had a red mark; I said with a smile:</p>
<p>"When second aunt broke her appearance, the windmill turned. Look!"</p>
<p>Second uncle wiped the bloodstains from second aunt's forehead.</p>
<p>The three of us laughed.</p>
<p>Two eagles with crossed wings, in the dark night</p>
<p>Roaring and exhaling strength.</p>

<h3>Glimpses of the Life of the Miao People in Guizhou</h3>
<p>— Gao Zhuo</p>
<p>Residence</p>
<p>The Miao people do not have cities, but they live together in settlements, forming "Miao villages." The size of a village varies, ranging from a dozen to several hundred households. Their dwellings are built like those of Han Chinese farmers, constructing tile-roofed houses or earthen-walled thatched houses in the mountains or on flat land, which serve as their places of abode. Miao houses are mostly simple, but a few wealthy Miao people also build residences with more than a dozen interconnected rooms. —In Dushan County, Guizhou, there is a "Tusi" (a ruler of the Miao people) named Meng. His residence is built on a mound, surrounded by mountains on three sides, with a river flowing in front, resembling a medieval European castle. The residence is surrounded by high walls, but the interior purely imitates the layout of old-style wealthy Han Chinese families, with calligraphy, paintings, and books filling the space, devoid of any "Miao" characteristics. However, it is said that a very few of the most backward "Sheng Miao" (raw Miao) still live in caves. Some Miao people also live in mixed communities with Han Chinese.</p>
<p>Miao villages are not protected by city walls, and they are naturally vulnerable to attacks by bandits. However, the Miao people have their own methods of defense: each household prepares weapons such as broadswords, guns, and bullhorns. In case of trouble, they immediately blow the horn and swarm out with weapons. The sound of the bullhorn can travel far, and it can be heard even ten miles away. Using the horn sound as a signal of distress to call for help has the same effect as the beacon fires used in ancient times. This often deters the attacking bandits from lingering.</p>
<p>Occupation</p>
<p>Agriculture is the main occupation of the Miao people. Similarly, the abundance or lack of land determines the quality of their lives. Miao farmers who engage in agriculture also engage in auxiliary industries such as weaving and raising silkworms. The finished cloth and silk floss are mostly brought to the cities to be sold to the Han Chinese. In the small cities and towns of Guizhou, commerce is underdeveloped. Trade is still limited to holding a market fair every few days to conduct "daytime trade." At this market, we can see the Miao people carrying their cloth, rice, grain, eggs, firewood, etc., to the market to sell, and at the same time buying the necessities and production tools they lack for their daily lives and taking them back. However, poor Miao people do not have land and cannot produce the things they need, so they have to sell their labor. Some of these Miao people work on other people's land, exchanging their labor for the necessities of life—this is what is called "long-term labor." Some go to the cities to work as servants for Han Chinese, and some go to counties such as Tieyuan and Yuping in eastern Guizhou to work as porters transporting stones. In addition, there are also those who work as "coal miners." The most unique way of life is that of the Miao people who live on the water. In eastern Guizhou and Hunan, there are rivers such as the Wu River and the Qing River. In southwestern Guizhou bordering Guangxi, there is the Rong River. Transportation in these areas requires the use of small wooden boats on the water, and some Miao people in Guizhou serve as "navigators" for these river voyages.</p>
<h3>Summer's Gift</h3>
<p>— Zhen Ai</p>
<p>These days, Mr. Zhang often quarrels with his wife because Mr. Zhang is really upset! He wipes his sweat with a handkerchief all the time, and the handkerchief smells sour. The children all suffer from prickly heat, crying and shouting in pain. They are thirsty and have nothing to drink, and at night they are bitten by mosquitoes and insects and cannot sleep peacefully…</p>
<p>One day, Mr. Zhang's wife came back from outside, holding a package in her hand. Mr. Zhang opened it and found that it was:</p>
<p>Wuzhou Cologne 　One bottle</p>
<p>Wuzhou Medicated Powder 　One can</p>
<p>Wuzhou Fruit Syrup 　One bottle</p>
<p>Wuzhou Mosquito Coils 　One box</p>
<p>With these items, the handkerchief smells fragrant with cologne, the children have no prickly heat after applying medicated powder, the fruit syrup tastes delicious and quenches thirst when mixed with water, and burning mosquito coils ensures a peaceful night's sleep. From then on, Mr. Zhang's spirit was calm, and in addition to praising his wife, he also said:</p>
<p>"These products from Wuzhou Pharmacy are a gift of summer."</p>
