<p>— 立</p>
<p>蔣委員長日前從牯嶺飛到了廣州受着當地各界空前熱烈的歡迎這一種民衆的熱情在他是十分應得的廣州本是蔣氏的革命勳業發軔的所在也是民國十五年他北伐誓師的地方自從那年七月他率領了國民革命軍出韶關以來已經十年餘了在這期間他為黨為國披荆斬棘成就了不少的功業到如今才有機會重返這革命策源地單從這一點就可以說蔣氏此行是一樁歷史的事件了</p>
<p>况且蔣氏此行對於國家還有更重大的意義在因為他决不是為遊覽而去的他這次到了廣州一則要策劃粤局的善後二則要斡旋桂局的和平　廣東在陳濟棠主政的時代苛捐雜稅名目繁多烟賭遍地貪汚成風現在陳氏棄職而走一切政務雖已由中央派員接收但是千頭萬緒整理需時這次蔣委員長親自到粤當然可使行政效率儘量增進各種困難迎刃而解粤桂兩省是息息相關的廣東的整理如能早見成效則桂局的收拾也就易於得手了</p>
<p>至於桂局李白自陳濟棠出走以後雖表示過不復抗命服從中央但不久又拒受了新命因此行將解决的桂局橫生波折使國人重復增添了不少的憂慮蔣委員長本着和平統一的主張在牯嶺時候發了東冬兩電前者對李白解釋疑團後者勸李白擺脫桂事接受新命言辭懇切語重心長這次到了廣州仍本初衷派香翰屏鄧世增到南寗去再對李白作懇切的勸慰我們以為李白本也是有功於國民革命的將領在這國難嚴重綏東又復告警的時候經過了蔣委員長的解釋勸慰總會捐棄成見以國家民族的存亡為前提和中央諸公團結合作的</p>
<p>我們本着憂國的眞忱預祝兩廣的局面因蔣委員長的安排可在不久的將來有光明璀燦的新的開展</p>

<p>— 義生譯</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰的風雲一天緊似一天，美國沿海岸的外國間諜亦一天多似一天。在去年一年間，歐洲各國用於間謀工作的金錢，推計美金五千萬元。亞州方面，祗日本一國，就用去美金一千二百萬元。他們用各種巧妙的方法，偷竊着各種新奇的軍事利器的秘密。</p>
<p>美國近年對於新軍器的發明很多山砲及臼砲的射程出乎意想之外。半自動式來福槍可使每個步兵化為機關槍手。一種機關砲可以每分鐘發射烈性炸彈一百五十枚，一種用七個人駕駛的坦克車，可以每句鐘奔馳六十英里。還有流質一種，用化學品汽油及炸藥合成，如果從飛機上投下，可使敵方房屋化成灰燼。海陸軍部對於新發明的試騐，雖保持着極度的秘密，然而外國來的間諜，祗要耳朶聽到，就千方百計的去探求。不久以前，美　瑪丁及塞可斯基　飛機廠，會有一種超級飛　製造成功。此說一出，就有五國的軍火經紀人，趕往該兩廠，要求先覩為快。這些軍火商代表大都係預備役軍官，可以隨時向本國的參謀本部直接報吿。</p>
<p>幾個月前紐約碼頭上，正當北德公司歐羅巴號啟椗之前，有穿平常服者人，携着手提琴箱一只，大踏步跨上跳板，欲上船去。此時忽有晤探一人上前，將他扣住，並在手提零箱內，查獲大批軍用地圖，秘密文件，武器圖樣，最新發明的飛機圖案，以及新發明戰鬥飛機用的摺疊式機關槍圖案。原來那人欲將此琴箱授與船上侍役，再由該侍役帶往隊州的某國。此一間謀僅以驅逐出境了事。因為美國處　間謀的法律是很寬的。</p>
<p>不久以前，有一個外國間諜來美，同一預備役軍官結識為友。軍官精於化學曾在政府機關服務。間謀賄以美金二萬五千元，　將美國陸　防毒面具內所用之藥水仿單偷出。那軍官需欵正急，便往說化學房某副手，許以一萬金之報償。不料那副手將此事吿知了主任。結果軍官不過受了革職的處分。</p>
<p>又有美國某要人由美京華盛頓乘火車回家。他所携的皮包内藏有關於國防的圖案多種。在途中奕有不相識者兩人來同他交談，下車後，又跟蹤追隨。過了不久，他發現辦公室的寫字台被人撬開了。原來有人向他的僕役暗送了五百金，將重要的文件偷去。</p>
<p>政府各機關的廢紙，常常有人用重金向看屋人收買去。美政府專利局亦是間諜們光顧的塲所。他們往往携重金訪問發明家探求技術上的秘密。美國新式坦克車發明家克利司的有一次拒絕了他們的要求，他們一回答說，『你還是出賣的好，不然，我們亦偷得到的。』</p>
<p>今年二月，美國陸軍部為愼重軍事秘密起見，頒布了很嚴密的指令。不論何人洩漏給任何軍寧秘密者，處以二年之監禁。凡將軍事秘密出賣或授與外國人者，處以二十年之監禁。</p>
<p>不久以前，有一個外國科學家，在緩步參觀某兵工廠之際，忽然揭起外衣，用裝在背帶上的小型拍照機，將某項重要機件攝去。這小型照相機，外觀好似一枚背帶上的鈕子。幸而當卽給該廠人員發覺了。</p>
<p>美國的海軍似乎還受着間謀艦隊的威脅。這說來很奇怪。可是美國海陸軍長官却深信不疑，因為有政府騐船師繪成的艦隊圖式做證據。該圖繪着一艘大捕魚船，有八千英里的繼續航行力。裝有强度的探海燈及無綫電機。現在美國太平洋沿岸，此種船隻有二百五十隻之多。平時以捕魚為名，往來遊行，一逢戰時，船內的魚舵及魚餌置藏室等，可立時改裝水雷魚雷管。而且船上駕駛人員多屬海軍預役軍人，兩國開戰一小時後，他們就可以向美國的戰艦開始攻擊。近來此等變相的軍襤，隨時隨地牢跟着美國的艦隊，尤其在美國的軍艦試演打靶的時候。</p>
<p>因為法律過寬的緣故，取締問諜是很難的。一個有名的政府密探說過。捉綁匪還覺得比捉間諜容易些。</p>

<p>失敗原因</p>
<p>記者首詢以通易公司失敗之原因、據談、該公司歷史、雖甚悠久、而近數年來、則已空虛、其失敗之原因、約有下述三點、（一）據本人統計、該公司之定期存欵利息、普通在九厘一分之間、最高有至一分二厘者、而其放出之欵、則僅一分二厘、兩相比對、不但無利可圖、卽開支亦成問題、（二）該公司與常州通成紗廠之放欵九十七萬八千元、及前北京政府財政部之借欵三十萬元、早成呆賬、而公司仍列為十足之資產、至公司動產亦無折舊一項、故早年賬面上雖有盈利、而實際則虧累不少（三）據上所述其內部之空虛、不言可知、而連年復多發股息及紅利、則均由資本項下提出、以圖苟延、其歷年提出本金數達十萬、此種政策、無異自速其亡、故終至一敗而不可收拾、</p>

<p>（三五）威尼斯之一日</p>
<p>二十日下午十一時郵船駛抵威尼斯、在船上舉行一個簡單的歡迎會後、十二時一刻我們下船、踏上了歐洲的大陸、輪埠前面有一條馬路、我們列隊走了二三百步、到一個小鵡的碼頭、由一艘專輪載着我們分到三個旅館寄宿、已是夜間二時半了、</p>
<p>威尼斯是著名全球的水都全城完全建築在水中、除掉房屋的前面、有行人道及幾條街道外、其餘完全是河道、以橋相通、計全城共有運河一百五十餘條、橋梁四百餘座、當專輪在一條大河裏前進的時候、全城已早入睡鄉、寂靜無聲、燈光倒射在碧綠色的河水裏、映成一條一條約曲綫、景色之佳、引起人們無限的美感、威尼斯之夜、眞是使人陶醉、使人留戀的、</p>
<p>德國預備了三節專車、到威尼斯來迎接、原定二十一晨七時啟程、但是因為那船邊到、大家旅送過於勞頓、特展期一日、因此得在威尼斯遊覽一日、</p>
<p>在這著名的水都裏、我們是尋不到一輛車子的代步的工具、或則是穿梭如織的汽船、或則是兩個人搖的頭尾尖嶠的遊艇、</p>
<p>二十一日上午十時、全體坐了汽船去遊聖馬可敎堂St.Marco　Church和特卡王宮Ducal　Palace當我們下了汽船、走到這兩座偉大莊嚴的建築前面廣塲的時候、不禁起了一種嚴肅的情緒、廣塲上停了無數的靈鴿、對遊客不但一點不畏懼、並且你如果化幾分錢在小攤上買一包玉蜀黍拿在手上、一羣靈鴿還爭着飛到你手臂上來吃、極為有趣、</p>
<p>聖馬可敎堂是為紀念耶穌的門徒馬可而建築的、他的墳墓據說就葬在敎堂下面、這座建築巳是十一世紀的遺物、堪稱莊嚴宏偉、走到裏面、陰沉沉的很容易使有宗敎信仰的人、發生一種神秘的感特卡王宮是中古時代威尼斯王國的宮殿、是一個四層樓的建築、自十三世紀開始到十六世紀止、歷年擴充、範圍十分偉大、現在威尼斯王國是早已消滅了、威尼斯市政府却把這座宮殿當作名貴的古蹟保存着、進去參觀的人、要納費十二里拉，（每里拉約合國幣三角）我們因為是團體祗納半價、王宮裏面陳列了歷代領袖的石像、雕刻極為精美、所有墻壁和天花板上、都畫着名貴的油畫、筆力雄偉、極為精緻、義大利的　刻與繪畫、在西洋藝術中是占着最重要的地位、在這裏多少可以看到他們的精神、有兩間陳列室陳列了許多中古時代的武器、刀劍矛盾、不一而足、還有幾其鋼盔鋼胄、從頭到脚、都是以純鋼鑄成、充分表現出那時代武士的尙武氣概、十六世紀初、機關槍也陳列了兩具、每具有十口、用的時候把火藥從砲口裝進去、再用機關一個一個的放射出去、經過四個世紀的進化、現在殺人的武器、已不與那時同日而語了、</p>
<p>武器陳列室的招待員、特別引我們去看陳列在玻璃橱裏的銷陰器、據說中古時代的武士出征的時候、恐怕他們的妻子犯姦淫、特用鋼鐵鑄成鎖陰的帶子、形狀好像現代女士所用的月經帶、祗有女子生殖器和肛門兩部、留出兩個刺狀的小孔、以男性為中心時代的武士對女子的威權、我們可以從這裏想像出來、</p>
<p>據說威尼斯王國實在是一個共和的政體、國王是由人民選舉的、是終身職、但不遺禪其子孫、有一個會議廳、長一百六十五英尺、寬七十五英尺、可容一千六百人、據說就是歷代國王召集貴族會議之所、四臂畫着歷代國王的像、天花板上則畫了一個皇后的像、很能表現出嚴肅的神緻、較小的會議廳、還有五六個之多、佈置大致相仿、</p>
<p>下午一時許我們回到旅館午餐、忽然烏雲密佈、暴雨驟作、選手們疲困之餘、都乘此機會在旅館裏休息、等到雨止天霽、已是夕陽西斜、全城幾十座敎堂的鐘聲、一陣一陣的傳來、把這美麗的水都、籠罩在神秘的空氣之中、選手們有的三五成羣、坐着遊艇在碧波中盪漾、有的在街頭巷尾、逍遙散步、有的就在旅館前面小園裏坐着聽樂隊奏演、義大利的音樂是獨步歐洲歌壇的、威尼斯旅館裏咖啡館裏所組織的五六個人的樂隊、到處皆是、曲調悠揚、音節淸雅、在國內是難得聽到的、中等以上的人、在一天工作勞疲之餘、去買了一杯咖啡或是冷飲、靜坐着欣賞（沒有跳舞）、可以說是滿坑滿谷、足見他們對於音樂與趣之濃厚、因為第二天一早要乘車啟程、晚間十時以前、選手們都已在這安靜的水都裏走入夢鄕了、</p>

<h3 id="c194">健康對於女子的終身問題 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 虹口產科醫院姚石年女醫師</p>
<p>充分的康健，可以令到一個女人更為可愛。每一個女子都想有吸引力的，因為她想得到每個女子應有的嫵媚。這樣一來，其先决之條件就非先有健康不可。</p>
<p>晶瑩的眼睛，紅潤的嘴唇，與光滑的顏容，這一切都楚表明體素得到一種特質的血液之營養所致。這裏一切的美的助力，都足以增加自然的吸引力……</p>
<p>那種弱不禁風的女子，在從前是很能得到男子之愛憐的，但此種已屬過去時代的女性，已不為現今的男子之所取了。</p>
<p>病態的女子，在今日已不復有吸引男子之力了。他們所要的是精靈的—有生氣而又健康的典型的女性。他們已明瞭疾病這種東西，不獨對於結婚生活的快樂有妨礙，而且就是對於戀愛的生活也不會怎樣的痛快與美滿的。</p>
<p>要保持女性的健康美，必須注意攝生。更其要注意月經期中的衛生。假使不注意衛生的話，就可以引起許多疾病。月經不調和白帶下，都是女性最普遍而且最苦惱的疾患。須立卽醫治，不能延誤！</p>
<p>性生活的要求，由紅潮而表現。誘起性生活之實體，雖是深隱不可得見，但每月的紅潮，則有性愛的波動，為女性顯示之事實。這是不可否定之生理的現象。</p>
<p>月經旣為女性的健康之徵，有創造人類能力的表現，故自不能加以汚蔑輕視。然而世上有許多女性，時有月經不調的苦惱，這個可悲的現象，就無異於證明女性的子宮不健全……</p>
<p>有健全的子宮，每月有月經的女性，無論如何醜陋，至少已確保共女性美之一。倘其子宮不健全的話，那末，自然就要發生月經不調，如經水的過少或是過多，經期不是超前就是落後，有時候乾血經閉，或者月經困難，於來潮前後的腹部疼痛，其外又有腐敗臭氣的赤白帶下等症。以致患者的身體消瘦，精神頹衰，疾病叢生，弄成一個多愁善病—羸弱不堪的女子。像這樣怎麽可以得到男子的愛呢？</p>
<p>愉快的和由於愛情中所得到的欣慰，事家庭環境生活中最有吸力的要素。所以那些弱不禁風的女士們，應該速求康健之路，不要在上生中只度着悲苦的生活！</p>
<p>依照世界名醫的臨床報吿，女性保健劑中以「美奴寗」Menorrin有重要的價値。凡氣血虧損，月經不調，赤白帶下，子宮萎縮，以及女性神經衰弱諸症，用「美奴寗」治療，都有特異的效果。就是無病的女子服用此藥，也是很有益的。能保持身體康健，容顏美麗，這樣，卽此到了中年以後，而其靑春仍可以保持着。</p>
<p>充分的生命之力為對於一個想得到女性嫵媚的女子的無價之寳—「美奴寗」也就是女性保健的源泉，解决痛苦的聖劑。</p>
<p>淋病指迷</p>
<h3 id="c195">淋病難愈之理由 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 章元楨醫師</p>
<p>—斷根治療之方法—</p>
<p>淋病的難以治愈，為翳界和病者所共同呼喊的一句話。牠難以治愈的理由是很多：第一是因為淋病的急性症候經過了，變成了慢性。慢性的時候，病人已沒有痛苦，不肯繼續醫治斷根，這就是病人沒有忍耐性的緣故。第二是因為病人不懂得攝生的道理。第三是經濟的問題，不能够長期就醫。第四就是職業的關係。除了上面所講的原因以外，還有最重大的：就是尿道經路上有許多粘液腺，潛伏到這個粘液腺管內深部的淋菌，實在難以消滅。所以表面上似乎已經治愈的淋病，遇着了勞苦房事飲酒等種種的誘因就再發作起來。所以要淋病斷根，必定要將粘液腺管內的淋菌，確實消滅了，方才可以斷根。</p>
<p>按市間普通的淋濁內服藥品，大抵效力微弱，難以殺滅深伏在粘液腺管內的淋菌，共誇大宣傳，自稱為淋病特效藥者，都不足以憑信。　依據實地之經騐，參合各名醫之報吿。咸以淋病是否能够痊愈，須視用藥之是否適常為標準。而淋病內服藥中之確實有效者，首推德國製造的、918　Anli-Gonc-Tab.（譯名九八白濁片）係依化學的最微妙的製劑，雖具有强大之透膜殺菌的效力，但對於人體是絲毫無害。其主治的範圍，不論男女急性與慢性的淋病，或因淋毒而起之變症，如睪丸腫痛，膀胱發炎，魚口橫痃便毒，關節瘋痛等疾，均極有效，尤以時發時愈之慢性淋病（卽老白濁）更有奇功。</p>
<p>患者於服用「九一八白濁片」之後，在翌晨排尿為藍色，有强烈之臭氣，同時自身感覺不可言喻之爽快，經數日後，卽能得無上之快慰，如欲確知淋濁是否根治者，可取服藥後之尿，請求專家用顯微鏡檢查，最為確實，蓋服藥後尿中淋菌逐日殺滅之現象，在顯微鏡下可以具體觀測，能令患者滿意。</p>
<h3 id="c196">肺病應戰之方策 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 沈兆荃醫師</p>
<p>六零六之治梅毒。金雞納霜之治瘧疾。皆藥到病除。此種對於某病有特殊效用之藥物。名曰某病之特效藥。若頭痛醫頭。脚痛醫脚。僅足以治標之藥。則屬於對症療法。與特效藥完全不同。</p>
<p>治肺病雖無特效藥。但人身本有自然治愈之機能。倘患者施行適當之方法。以補助促進其自然治愈機能。亦可達到根治。蓋人身之防禦力旺盛（卽自然治愈之機能旺盛）。則病灶周圍。能增生一極堅固之結締組織。包裹病菌。使病變之作用。完全失其活動。以至痊愈。此防禦機能之消長。即身體與病菌戰爭勝敗之所由分也。</p>
<p>肺病病人因病魔久纏於身體。則此等防禦機能。（自然治愈機能）。往往發生阻害。甚至不能發展者有之。此時則不得不藉人力以補助之。夫與結核菌（癆蟲）戰。以包圍結核之病灶。待敵自滅之為得策。故肺結核（肺癆）之自然治愈。實亦根據此原理。吾人　達肺病治愈之目的。則當明此自然療法之妙機。作為應戰之方針。應戰之鐵軍。即臟器療法是也。</p>
<p>據多數學者之硏究。治療肺病之惟一方法。全在乎補助其生理的防禦機能。而使之旺盛。最為合理。此生理的防禦機能之促進方法。幷非任何藥物療法所能奏效。惟有臟器療法可達到此目的。此種臟器製劑。得世界醫師之推獎者。祇有「肺活」Phith　Weal為確有根據而切實合理之臟器製劑也。</p>
<p>「肺活」Phith　Weal之成分及效用。本品係採取壯健動物新鮮肺臟與脾臟中提出之。內分泌素—荷爾紫—混合製成之內服液。其功用能使已哀萎之肺臟機能—返弱為强—促進其防禦力。而使生理的自然治愈之機能旺盛。如組織缺損（即肺有空洞之處）者得以塡袖之。同時在病部之周圍。築成鞏固結締織之牆璧。使之硬化。促其疤痕之結合。完全包裹惡魔之結核菌（癆菌）。失其活動。終必使其完全消滅。以至痊愈。故患者於服用「肺活Phith　Weal之後。不數日即感覺精神爽快。食慾增進。咯痰稀鬆。咳疾减少。潮熱·盜汗·皆見消失。倘連續服用。同時幷注意一般衛生療法。定能於極短期內。高奏凱歌。重登健康之城。</p>

<p>— 沈兆荃</p>
<p>氣管枝喘息。一名氣喘。一名痰喘。亦有以喘急。喘促名之者。本病之原因。為發特異呼吸困難之症。由於細氣管枝壁之輪狀筋起强直性痙攣所致。</p>
<p>（病狀）恒於夜間突然發生是症。先覺胸悶·顏面蒼白·而呈苦悶之狀·冷汗淋漓·呼吸十分困難·非常努力·且延長而帶喘鳴·腹筋緊張如板·咯出之痰成黃綠色。</p>
<p>（治法）發是病時。令服「哮立平」Holipin三片（此為成人量）可立刻止喘。轉危為安。若欲根治。預防再發。則當續服至一二月之久。始能痊愈。倘平日息慢性氣管枝炎（卽久咳）者。其肺臟之抗病力必甚薄弱。且組織萎縮。生理的機能衰退。故治愈較難。必須同時加服「肺活」Phith　Weal一藥。使肺之生理機能旺盛。肺力健全。則哮喘始無再發之苦。</p>
<p>（攝養注意）患者須避溫度之急變。忌食刺戟性之物。宜呼吸稀薄之空氣。常為室外之運動。如身體虛弱貧血以及神經衰弱之患者。平日宜服用榮養强壯劑。如「米美爾補腦汁」Memory　Neurotic甚為有效。</p>

<p>— 上海海寗路克能海路口市民療養院徐生章醫師撰述</p>
<p>（全日送診號金兩角）</p>
<p>父母保護愛兒者……　怎樣預防夏令危險的……</p>
<p>赤痢與疫痢</p>
<p>疫痢係小兒病中最危險者，其原因是為食未熟的水菓或腐敗的飲食物而起，本病以三歲至六歲之小兒最多，哺乳兒殆無患之者。</p>
<p>突然發高熱而手足厥冷，陷於昏睡的，是疫利，便中混有血液的，是赤痢。這都是赤痢菌與疫痢菌之作怪；赤痢是以初起下痢而發熱，後來排出帶粘液的血便為特徵，死亡率平均為一六至三〇％而於小兒，更其危險。</p>
<p>疫痢是起初發生腹痛，頭痛，嘔吐而多少有點發熱，隨後便下痢起來；經過數小時，突然發四十度以上的高熱而立刻陷於昏睡狀態；利害的，會在發病一日之內死去。預防法；第一要注意飲食物，不可吃生冷東西·蠅子也是赤痢，疫痢的媒介物，所以對於食器和食物，必須注意不要落上蠅子。而給兒童餅物或果物時，更應該特別小心。</p>
<p>倘見小兒發呆—不活潑—無氣力，煩燥不安，腹脹，下痢，嘔吐，微熱等病象的時候，即宜速服「敵腸痢」藥　Dys-etrin　Tab.常可消弭禍患於無形，此為保護愛兒不至於死在疫痢的第一條件。大抵小兒都有食積，易起消化不良的腸胃病，故服用『敵腸痢」掃除腸管內的不消化物質，制止腸內有害腐敗菌之活動，幷且能同時促進腸胃的生理機能，健胃消食，增加榮養，所以服此藥是有百利而無一弊，欲保護愛兒者，幸勿輕視。</p>

<p>— 姚石年女醫師</p>
<p>母乳中的營養素。其配合之完全。當然無待說得的了。此外如淸潔之點。授乳便利之點。在乳兒營養上說起來。無一可及母乳。母乳不僅能使乳兒健全發育。而且縱如乳兒有消化不良等情。也不若人工營養屢有生命危險。</p>
<p>母乳育兒。旣有種種利益。故在可能範圍之中。務以母乳育兒為是。但如產婦的營養不良——或乳腺發生變態與機能不全。皆能使乳汁的分泄減少或中止。於是。對於育兒發生種種的困難問題。這是我們常見到的事實。</p>
<p>乳汁缺乏的主要原因。多以母體營養不良。——而致乳腺萎縮所起。我們欲補救乳汁不足問題。須由根本上增進母體的營養。促進乳腺的分泌為最要方策。</p>
<p>根據鄙人服務『虹口產科醫院』多年的硏究——和臨床上的實騐。虛弱的婦女。在姙娠期間。如先服用『康氏生活素』Conbour's　San-Vita-Cell數瓶可使營養佳良——血氣旺盛。至分娩後乳汁分泌自多。旦於產後可快復康健。因為身體强壯而抵抗力增加。能却除產後一切疾病！</p>
<p>近有生乳新藥『媽媽多』Mammato係採用母牛的乳房製成。對於乳汁缺乏的治療。頗有特效。服後能使乳汁分泌旺盛。營養分。更加豐富。且能兼補母體。余已實騐數百餘劑。均甚美滿。爰記之本刊。以吿姙產的女界同胞。</p>

<p>— 姚慕</p>
<p>在　國的大都會的　湧的人海裏獨自　寄着，會幾度沉湎于朋友的熱情中的我，縱不感寂寞，也有兒陌生吧。</p>
<p>有一天驀地裏我的記憶中浮起一個日本舊同學的影子來。他說歸國已有十年了，在這悠長的歲月中，我們有過兩三度通訊之後便絕了音問，只從別人的口中知道他會一度試作詩意的自殺；終於跟一個藝妓結了婚，但是詩還是依舊是他的生活的目的和生活的手段。「也許他還在東京吧？也許他已經成了名詩人吧？訪尋他大槪還易。」我這樣子想。此後我在逛書店消磨日子的時候便留心文藝雜誌的目錄。果然在一個新刋的雜誌裏發現他的作品了，還是詩，而且跟從前一樣的瑰奇。我馬上寫一封帶着風趣的熱情的信，寄到那雜誌去。我抱着好奇心和預期的歡悅等着等着。一天過了，兩天過了，還沒有見他來，也接不到他的回信，我以為雜誌社把我的信扔在字紙　裏去了。</p>
<p>到了第四天，我照平日一樣的在外頭吃過簡單的午飯回到公寓裏，經過應接間的當兒，猛然有一個異樣的人站起來呌我一聲，我嚇了一跳，仔細看時，這人就是我所翹企着的日本朋友。他厚大的嘴唇上已長了一捻褐黃色的小鬍子，頭髪還是像從前那樣一把雜亂的草。</p>
<p>『依舊「製造」着詩吧，還是那樣decadent（頹廢）？』我不禁把從前我們慣用來互相調笑的字眼再翻出來。</p>
<p>他微笑答應我之後，我們便談到彼此別後的生活。我知道他眞個結了婚，而且已是三個孩子的父親了。</p>
<p>『詩在這兒是不值錢的，而且一個月也嘔不出兩三首出來，只好當新聞記者。』這話出自本色的詩人的口中更帶着現實的人生的苦味。</p>
<p>跟着他把他所記得的舊同學的近況問長問短，而他結論却是：『他們都了大人物了！』</p>
<p>正是我們可以對他們　　的地方呢。可是，提他們做甚呢？你還記得你讚頌的渡　　家女嗎？』我逗他一句。</p>
<p>他不覺哈哈笑起來。</p>
<p>「×城的風光我還常夢見，我記得還做了一首詩　寫海邊大馬路上　公共廁所所出來的苦力們呢。」</p>
<p>我們的談話這樣子便完全沒在過去的回憶中，而青年時代的無邪的清狂的生活　　然重現在我的眼前。</p>
<p>那時候，我也是在做着詩，而且刻意做着頹廢和清態的詩，惡之花，成為我的典型，帶有中世的陰鬱意味的Rossetli　Swinburns等小名家之作，也是我所耽好的。魔塔打印紙嚴的牽牛花，蝙蝠的白日夢是我的想像力所馳騁的地方。在行動上自也沉溺於女人和酒所引起的興奮和惆悵之中。</p>
<p>但是，在僞善，淺灣的美國化的學校環境裏，這種行徑自然被目為外道，而我的朋友便有限了。這位日本朋友却還跟我合得來。他的蓬亂的頭髪，亂七八糟隨處堆着書和骯髒的衣服的寢室，深夜裏夢游者似的在校園裏的蹀　，不過是他的詩意的生活的一部份。不過給我印象最深的還是他的詩的愛好和詩的風俗。他隨時隨地却在「製造」着詩，縱然，只是手工業的製造。日本詩本來帶有異樣的情趣，而他的想像力更特別的瑰奇，用意遣詞超詩的因襲之外。他的詩雖然也帶有病態不過他的觀察是入微的多方面的，而且帶輕微的風刺。他的題材俯拾卽是，在路上小便的小孩，垃圾堆，自己的靴，電燈柱子，一一却可以拿來做詩，不過正從這裏，我們可以窺見他的詩的人間味和社會味。</p>
<p>跟他來往，一道兒聊天，散步的結果，我漸漸受到他的影響，感到我的詩太過因襲了，太覺自我化了，我也開始改變我的作風。可惜，他不久就回到日本去，而我也因為生活改變的緣故，差不多與詩絕緣了。他的影響到底生不出甚麼效果中。</p>
<p>沈醉在這樣的過去的回憶中，我們的友情的火燼再燃着。我答應過幾天到他家裏再作長談和拜見他的太太。</p>
<p>一個微雨的上午，我費了一點麻煩終於找到他的家了。一間一樓一底的六疊的小房子內，一個披着白圍裙的女人在收拾着屋子，兩個面目有點兒骯髒的男子在門口玩着，我的朋友却還沒有起來。</p>
<p>『對不起，昨晚喝酒喝得太多了，我點鐘才睡下。』等了許久，我的朋友才帶着惺忪的臉孔走出來。他把我眞上樓去，談了一會，剛才在樓下的女人便端茶和糖果上來，深深的給我作日本式的敬禮。經他的介紹，才知道她就是他的太太。青年時的美麗的痕跡似乎還留在她的姣好的眉目間，但是她的額間和眼尾的皺紋又像是烙上了過度生育和勞作的印，使她的外貌的蒼老有點與她的年紀不相稱。不過，最使我驚異的還是那頗蕭條約四壁和空洞沒有甚麼書的書架。當我伸手從書架翻他的書時，他似乎猜中我的疑惑了</p>
<p>『大部分的書都擱在「質屋」了，剩下這裏的只是些當不了的，』他微笑的向我解說。</p>
<p>『在這裏，書也可以當嗎，那眞不錯！』我們的話題隨就轉到別的地方去了。吃了他特意呌太太買回來的香蕉之後，我便告辭。但是，『詩人……酒……書……質屋……三個孩……』等等至今還在我的腦海裏縈繞着。</p>
<h3 id="c222">王占福進城 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 李</p>
<p>王占福來在這座古城里是近三四天的事情，他每看一件東西全覺有趣，他感謝自己有個住在城親戚，否則他就萬萬不會有這樣的機會，　子便也只有在鄉下消磨完結了。他的親戚在城裏作小買賣，打算來請他到城裏住幾天，逛逛景緻，在信上並日說出城裏諸種熱鬧處，道，打動了他死寂的心。他下了一封回信，告訴親戚卽刻動身，當他湊好了盤用和零用欵項之後，擇一個天氣晴明的日子，也拋下家裏田事上的工作，帶着一顆歡快的心思，樂顛顛地逕自坐上直開城裏的一列火車。進城來三四天中，他把每天的日子全化費在遊街逛景察看城裏人們生活情形的事情上。</p>
<p>那一天他正在街上閑逛着，望着商店櫥窗中的各式貨色出神，痴痴地聽着無綫電播音，覺得很有趣，電車，汽車，馬車，洋車以及諸種來往的行人對他說　　　　。他只顧看，只顧聽，簡直忘記了再移動自己的脚步。又是過一會他却拉住一個小販，偷偷摸摸很怕別人窺到似的掏出兩大枚買了兩塊洋糖，紅着臉一道送到沮裏去了。他正自沮嚼着其中的眞味時，忽然讓近處的一堆人影勾去了他的視綫，看了一會，他覺着其中一定有什麼玩意兒，他為的要多開眼界，就毫不思索地一直奔了過去。</p>
<p>幾個人正在一堆爭吵着，似有不能完結的事情，他仔細一看，看出來有一個人手裏拿着一張紙，在人面前　着，嘴裏不住說　「不行，不行，這個價錢怎樣也不行，還的太及，有誠心的多加一點。」</p>
<p>王占福認出來，那是一張當票，他不解內中的道理，但他猜到一定別有故事在着。接着他就明白了，那是有一種交易在他們之中往返着，正如在灘子上主客之間講　　價的情形一樣，不過在灘上買的是貨物，在這裏　　　的都是一張當票。那人似乎已經看得出他是個良好的買主，故意把當票拿到他的面前幌了幾幌，彷彿給別人的貨色看，怪客人選擇似地　：「單是一件皮襖首飾，價錢三千塊開外，一塊半錢買當票，不是太便宜了麼。這怎麼行。頂少也還得再添一回，不添不行，我實在窮得　有一點辦法，也不忍心賣這張值錢的當票」。</p>
<p>「那我就再多出一毛錢，一塊六，再多一枚也不加！」一個麻臉漢子大聲沰着，惟恐別人聽不銅陵的樣子，他擺着手，意思是呌別人賞識他的大方，添了一毛錢，這是很夠勁兒的大舉動。</p>
<p>「你搶我的買賣呀，哼，逼罷，我這回也添一毛！」</p>
<p>說這話的是個身材魁梧的漢子，像在和別人睹着氣，他瞪起兩只賊溜溜的眼睛，那神氣，分明是暗示別人他是一個了不起的人物，他是很有些男子氣的。</p>
<p>在王占福看來，買賣這回一定能夠成交，因為賣主希望有人再添一次價錢就出售，現在竟至添了兩回價，自然該賣了。他眼看一塊七毛錢就買去了那張當票，直如眼看別人買去了頭彩，那人眞可以算是有福氣。他不該眼看別人輕易買去了頭彩，只要他再加一毛錢，他就發了一本萬利的洋財。他有些恐慌，生怕那人就此答應了賣出當票去，他不能再猶豫，決心參加這個競爭，把頭彩買回來，他　不能去這緊要關頭好機會。</p>
<p>「添也不能添這麼少」那票主不待他開口，先就否認了他所答應的條件。「這　　數都出不到，不是開玩笑麼」。他解說着，「大當舖不當壞東西，皮襖首飾還有不值錢的麼。五塊當價，算利錢一共有六塊錢足够，有錢人不買他再別想找這樣機會」。</p>
<p>「沒有說你當票不值錢」，一個矮個人接下去說，「可是東西一經外賣，像當票債券，就當眞不能值多大的錢。你信麼。</p>
<p>王占福這時暗暗盤算起來，算算那當票上所開的東西，值二十多塊並不算多，就算出賣打一半虛扣，也還靠得住有小二十塊錢，買下來萬萬不會吃了虧。他決心出兩塊錢，剛剛那人的希求不也只是這樣的數目麼。可是他存了個取巧的心思，他要分兩次給那人添錢，這是一種手段。決定好了，他鼓起勇氣，大聲說道：「啊，我給你再添一毛錢，好不好？我看你用錢很急，才給你多添一毛。」</p>
<p>他這舉動似乎很驚動了在塲的人，人們對他全豎起驚奇的眼光，無形中他作了極頂的英雄。果然沒有人再出聲，且有人放棄競買權，帶着點氣憤一轉身到別處買便宜貨去了。</p>
<p>想不到這時候居然有一個人和他鬧起蹩扭，就是那麻臉，他也不知遭了什麼邪，居然，又添了半毛！迫得他一鼓氣還到了兩塊，交易便在他的勝利期望中完成了，他歡歡喜喜地走了回去。他把這張當票奉給他的親戚看，一面歡天喜地般說道：「你看，兩塊錢買了三四十塊錢的東西，還有作什麼買賣有這大的利息！這一趨進城，是頭一回，作到這麼大利息的買賣也是頭一回。」</p>
<p>「啊，你這回可上了一個大當，」那親戚看完當票跌足呌道，「這是一張假票！這是一專門騙人的玩意兒，你怎麼好多事呢！」</p>
<p>「票上不是有舖址價碼當物麼」，他還有些不相信，「寫得明明白白怎是假的！」</p>
<p>「那也全是假的，告訴你，你這回可是作了一回吃虧的買賣。」</p>
<p>他依然不相信，還以為親戚嫉妬他幸運故意打趣他呢。他照着當票聲明的地址去尋找當舖，到那裏一打聽，是眞是假就全可明白了。他在那條街上走了五個來回，望不見一家當舖，到這時，他才知道自己當眞上了當，想想那如同飛去一般的兩塊錢，心急氣憤出一身汗，人呆住了。</p>
<h3 id="c223">生活底形式 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 梁啟筠</p>
<p>「在這裏住下不壞吧。」——我底介紹人郭三太這樣對我說。</p>
<p>郭三太是個五十來歲的肥矮婦人。有一付慈悲的心腸，據說那是為了信神的緣故。手邊略蓄了一點錢，但，對於一個小錢也是吝嗇的。——我搬進了那開後房三星期後，前樓的陳師奶偶爾地和我閒談起來，她非惡意地就說着這些話。從她那裏，我還得知了下面的關於我底介紹人底事情。——隔壁住着一個巫婆，供着一位西侯王的菩薩。擁有大羣的信男善女，郭三太是她底虔誠的子弟之一。</p>
<p>我很快地就和我底鄰居們熟悉了。五百剷三缺一的時候，他們永遠不會忘記逸。他們不知怎的會這樣的稱呼我。</p>
<p>賭夥中，亭子間的洗伯清，那個膠鞋廠工人，是頂有趣的人物。祇要有了他，就什麼都有生氣起來了。他打「二索」，便說，</p>
<p>「給你們一根呀。」</p>
<p>人們聽了大笑着。女人家就紅了臉。我不大懂，大槪下面還有些淫　的字眼隱藏了的。有時他遇着吃一張順子時，就自言自語地問道：</p>
<p>「哦，姘一個好麼？」</p>
<p>我不希罕這個。但，人家都歡迎着，因而狂笑起來。恐怕他們太缺乏笑底資料吧。是的，人是應該時常笑的。煩惱的生活假使沒有笑來調和，日子將不知要變成怎麼的無味，單調，和陰鬱了。</p>
<p>沈默的菜販子陳各，天色纔現出灰茫的魚肚白，他就上市塲去。在雀戰緊張的空氣中，他有我們唯一的土產國民性，沈着，鎭靜，和忍。人有點近視。俯着腦袋，紅葡萄似的大鼻子像在桌子上磨擦着一般。</p>
<p>我很少逗留在家裏的。</p>
<p>「老弟，你少不免要做點虛僞，人們生活着祇不過混混而已。你儘在外邊多跑跑，不管它失業不失業，人家會自然而然地敬重你的。而且，躱在家裏，就是街上有黃金可攜帶，你也不知道的嗄。</p>
<p>經紀交易人楊建臣對我敎訓似地說。那時我剛失了業。說話時，他底鼻子有趣地抽縮着。像是誇張着他底「聰明」和「有見識」一樣。每次，他底鼻子動着了，就似乎許默語着；</p>
<p>「你瞧，你就是這麼厲害的傢伙。」</p>
<p>他到底太厲害了。</p>
<p>因為私運手槍而犯了罪，他便給處判了很長久時間的徒刑。</p>
<p>然而，他所說的話，却實在是有幾分意思的。</p>
<p>我應當感謝他的，在外面的日子多，很快地找到我底工作了。那是一家自來墨水筆公司底跑街。一種以誇大狂，吹牛，和引誘混合成功的法術，而去騙取不願交易的顧主們口袋裏的金錢的職業。</p>
<p>在家的時候，我很少得到空閒。</p>
<p>晚上，假期日，我無街可跑了。芳鄰們老把我拖入雀戰中。他們日常的進欵大都是菲薄的，但，奇怪的都是第三期肺癆病的賭迷。像膠鞋廠工人洗伯清；菜販子陳各；前樓陳師奶底丈夫陳其斌；巫婆許大姑，那個以神秘的，愚弄別人的騙術而生活的人……。</p>
<p>陳各又是唱「班本」，讀「木魚書」的好手。狹小的屋子裏，時常圍了一些人。他們底熱情，好奇，懷疑的眼光，飄浮在那些「劉金定私探營房」，「蘇娘寫血書」，「慈雲太子走國」，「胡生哭別」一類的陳腐的俗套的故事底言律上面。</p>
<p>我時常做他底義務顧問。他要求我為他闡明一些深奧的句子，和生癖的難字底意義。…</p>
<p>我在那裏住了一個不很久的時候纔搬走了。</p>
<p>生活底形式是多方面的。——在各種的形式之下，許多人過活着。</p>

<p>— 土井逸雄著歐陽凡海譯</p>
<p>說到苦力帛駝的父親，是一個為了偷飼料給自己底馬吃而躱入小馬房去的家伙。他併命想念女人，然而他所想的那女人，却是自己底兒子苦力帛駝底戀人。</p>
<p>兒子和女兒們都被父親底情熱所追逼着，便想許多方法，而在金錢上用起手段來了。苦力帛駝想免除父親底束縛，造樂於自由的戀愛而沒有金錢，便去會見借錢的高利貸，那知道高利貸就是自己底父親。在這裏，製成父親兒子或家庭形式之外壳的舊道德早已無力了。父親罵兒子放蕩，兒子罵父親畜生。</p>
<p>代之以强慾與純情的對立，在這兒的典型，是被金錢縛束了的人類，用種種原始的方法，努力於創造新的生活樣式。這種尙是初期的近代生活的本質，一直發展到今日的我們之間來，並且生出種種不同的形態。莫利哀底眼睛深銳地射入現實之中，就是現代的我們底心也從深處被感動着。</p>
<p>莫利哀並不用這個劇本向觀眾說敎，可是看了這個劇本而不情不自禁地出聲大笑的看客，怕一個也沒有吧。於是大家就會想，這樣有趣的塲面眞是有的麼？</p>
<p>守財奴底笑確實像茁强的健全者的笑一樣。眞正可笑的東西，我們常因虛禮而只好不笑；我們有習慣於想怒和想說的都被抑制以終的傾向之危險。</p>
<p>率直而不客氣地也嘲笑可笑的東西的莫利哀底大胆，給與我們的演劇一個方向，給與觀客及我們一個積極性。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c226">從搬家說起 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 楊</p>
<p>在上海這個地方，搬家一事，對於獨身者是一椿頗嚴重的問題。不是嗎，招租的條子，大都是寫着什麼『非眷莫問』的。</p>
<p>自己在上海前後住了八九年，始終沒有什麼『家眷』，又沒有職業，每次搬家，便覺頭痛。</p>
<p>『家眷呢？』——沒有。</p>
<p>『那麼，在什麼地方發財呢？』——沒有。</p>
<p>於是，我便要看到一副難為情的忠厚的臉孔，或看到兩隻懷疑的狡猾的眼睛，而結果却同樣，要被婉轉或不客氣地拒絕了的。</p>
<p>還好，這個住要錢租，租要人担保的社會，敎訓了人一件保護自己的方法：撤謊。</p>
<p>『我的女人再過幾天就從家裏來了。』</p>
<p>『我是在某書局當校對的，不必到書舖去，好在家裏辦公……』</p>
<p>像這一類的撤謊，就是我每次搬家成功的秘訣。</p>
<p>又還好，自己是一個惰性很强的懶鬼，住定一個地方了，非因二房東壓迫得太利害——如電燈不準開到夜裏十二點鐘……等，或因自己的方便而到了不得不搬的時候，便不想搬；搬了，也不願意離開舊址太遠，離開那些日夜要印着自己的足跡的馬路，時時要看到的那些商家店舖的招牌，以至那些似乎非常熟識而又不認識的左右隣近的男男女女。說起來，惰性强眞使我省　了不少搬家的麻煩呵！</p>
<p>現在我住在這裏，已快近一個月了。不待說，在決定搬到這裏來之前，我是費了許多的時間考慮過的：第一，房租便宜，每月連給娘姨的錢才十塊；第二，還清靜，可以寫文章；第三，有浴室，這在夏天是頂要緊的；第四，喫的問題，附近有俄國菜館，每頓兩毛小洋便可以有一菜，一杯紅茶，幾片麵包，合算得很；第五……總之，覺得件件妥當，我很高興地搬進來了，撒了一個謊，說是在書舖當編輯的，在家裏辦事。</p>
<p>好得很！搬進來了以後，在頭一天，我就發見一個大缺陷了：喫東西非跑兩里路不可。</p>
<p>我太大意了；然而世事也眞變得太快呵。在去年冬天，這附近的確有幾家俄國菜館，現在却一家沒有了！附近雖然有飯館，這幾年來就總喫麵包。我怎麼辦呢？</p>
<p>沒有辦法，還是住下去。第一，我眞不願意『搬』這個麻煩；第二，房租十塊錢是好容易才弄到的。</p>
<p>一天二天地過去，每天為着喫要跑四次長路。像最近幾天這麼熱的天氣，眞有點苦人。每天為着喫所流的汗，恐怕會把工弄成更加乾巴的一個瘦鬼的罷。</p>
<p>然而，這快近一個月的時間，使我對這附近事物發生一種莫明其妙的感情了。連最初感覺非常苦惱的『喫』的問題，近來也漸漸好了，不覺得怎樣不便，有時反而要覺得有趣哩。起初決心住一個月就搬，現在也不想搬了，好儘可以永久住下去的樣子……晤，那天天要跑幾次的長路，那給人家釘在路邊的不健康的樹木，那烟紙店小伙計的骯髒而輪廓漂亮的臉孔，那每晚夜深人靜時的蛙聲，那每天要上幾次的抽水馬桶，那每早要把我吵醒的二房東太太的嘩啦嘩啦……這些這些，不管是我喜歡的，憎惡的，都和我的生活結起了難解的因緣，把我纏住了，使我不能也不願離開它們……唔，如果沒有意外的力推動，我怕是可以永久在這兒，就這樣地住下去的罷。我感覺到自己惰性太强的苦悶了！</p>
<p>細想，惰性太强的人是不大中用的一個包；我事事落伍，不易長進，人家在前頭衝鋒陷陣了，我却還遠遠地站在後面揑着拳，也就為着此罷？</p>
<p>對的，惰性太强的確是使人不長進的一個最大毛病！譬如說，我和別人一樣，要女人，也要喫。這四五六年，我是時時要想到女人的身體的，然而這五六年來，我獨身着，旣沒有機會讓我自然地碰到女人，又沒有勇氣去奪人家的『鴿子』，便只好在所謂『風農月夕』忍着自己的春夢了。一天兩天，一年兩年地這樣過去，到了成為我一種不易移動的惰性，想非遇到强有力的刺　和推動，恐怕就這樣可以過一生的罷。喫也是一樣，我餓了便想喫，有得喫又常常想喫好一點，然而天上旣不會掉下火腿或什麼雞絨爛魚翅給你，自己又沒有利害的手從人家的嘴上奪下牛酪麵包，便只好半飽半餓地，讓它營養不良起來，不會馬上就死算了。一天兩天，一年兩年地這樣過去，到了現在也就過慣，貧困的鹹澀生活已變為自己一種不移動的惰性，要是突然有會踏入豪華奢靡的生活環境裏，倒會覺得不安侷促，而惹起憎惡之感的呵。</p>
<p>我的身體應該努力去為女人和更有滋養的食物呀　然而我却安於現狀，不求進取。我不中用，我的惰性太强了！</p>
<p>我羨慕惰性弱的人！</p>
<p>能夠沒有惰性更好！</p>
<p>唔，沒有惰性……</p>
<p>唔，唔……</p>
<p>沒有惰性？天下有這種人嗎？</p>
<p>有，那將是怎樣的一個人呢？</p>
<p>那，將令你捉摸不到……</p>
<p>那，將成為高爾基所稱的動物底個人主義者；為着自己的利害，他可以一刻千變，不加思索……</p>
<p>那不是很可怕嗎？</p>
<p>唔……</p>
<p>想想看：半夜還在做着遊大觀園的夢，夢入太虛幻境，三更一覺醒來，却是一條像梁山泊的好漢……</p>
<p>唔，剛剛才是飛鷹海燕，眨下眼便變得是猪頭狗臉；今天演大凈，明兒做小丑；此刻義士，後一刻流氓……</p>
<p>如果世間都是這種完全沒有惰性或惰性幾無的人，那不太可怕了嗎？</p>
<p>唔，唔，想到這裏……</p>
<p>還是講每個人惰性强一點罷！</p>
<p>然而，自己的惰性到底是太强了一點，强到呆板，　　，非辦證法底了……</p>
<p>好！下個月還是搬家！</p>

<p>因為有幾種生殖器病。如攝護腺炎。尿道炎。精液漏等。很像是淋病的徵象。普通人往往不容易辨別。因而私心惴惴。雜藥亂投。反而把病弄壞了。還有一種是淋病未愈。或初染淋病。却不把他認做淋病。因而遷延貽誤。豈不謬哉。要鑒別這種病的原因。最好是用顯微鏡來檢騐小便。可以分別出有沒有淋菌。就可斷定是不是淋病。這樣就不致有盲從醫藥的弊病了。在上海。設有檢騐淋病。而且是不收費用的。那末只有法租界寗波路六十四號。父子醫院了。就是婦女之患白帶。而欲檢查是否為淋病者。也很便利。均由女助醫檢騐。在幾分鐘內。就可得準確報吿。</p>

<p>往往結婚未久的年幼婦女。忽焉發熱。顏色蒼白。精神不快。叩問其病苦。則時時意欲小便。白帶甚多。腰問關節筋肉疼痛等。那是潔白淸凈的新婦。已遭結婚前放蕩的夫婿所累。淋病的微菌。多闢一嶄新蕃殖之地。蔓延勢盛。不多幾天。就要起子宮內膜炎。喇叭管膿腫。若於此時不速急治。則必引起腹膜炎。以致如花的美貌。倐為萎謝的花朶。甚則久困床褥。瘦骨支離。或則神經衰弱。難於生育。人生若此。又何樂趣之可言。凡婦女害着此病。很難療治。所以遇到女子常發熱。或是下腹猝痛牽引。尿道中白帶甚多的時候。就有害着淋病的嫌疑了。在那時應該切實地去就治。不然還要蔓延到子宮極深層裏。發生種種危險各症。上海法租界。父子醫院。出售之內服白帶丸。及外用白帶片。同時服用。效騐殊偉。價每種二元。誠女界之良藥也。</p>

<h3 id="c235">世運會給我的感想 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 方克文</p>
<p>從八月一日起，報上對世運會的消息是頗為熱鬧的，直直到今天，報上刋出了「籃球亦歸淘汰，我選手團全軍覆沒，大會比賽之與我不相關」為止，我想大部份國人看報的人沒有一個是不翻一下的，之後呢，因為「全軍覆沒」因為已與我不相，而冷漢下去，大概也必然的吧？</p>
<p>之於我，其實說，我對世運會是並不怎樣熱心的，關於世運的新聞，我固然是看的，但那也祗和看戲目廣吿差不了多少，，原因倒並不是因為明知道我們的選手團一定喫鴨蛋，因之便不起勁，實實在在，却是因為我到現在還不相信，世運會對「世界和平」會有好處，甚之，「小矣哉」，於我們中國的體育會有好處，於我們中國人民的體格會有好處。</p>
<p>說到「中國」這兩個字，我想，他正確的含義，應該是指中國的全民大衆而言的，然而中國全民大衆的對體育上的享受是怎樣的呢？窮鄕僻地的入民不要說了，就以體育空氣最熱烈的上海民來說吧，有幾個是能眞正享受的呢？</p>
<p>說得難聽些，也可以說是說得眞實些我們之看田徑，我們之看球類比賽，那還又是上回力球塲，上戲院差不多，祗是為欣賞而去，而「玩」體育者，他們除了想造成幾個「體育明星」如「球大王」「美人魚」之外，此外好像也並不為了什麽。</p>
<p>這樣，我們道次世運選手團吃鴨蛋而回，我覺得敗也固然，勝了也並不見得怎樣光榮，因為卽使捧了大批金牌而回，於我們全國的面有菜色的民衆還是無干的。</p>
<p>自然，在讀報之餘，我對於我們的選手團「全軍覆沒」是也不免有威的，但這戚想說起來很簡單，祗是為了在我們回內名震一時，顯赫不可一世的例如「美人魚」等等，在國內是捧之迎之酬酢往還唯恐不週，甚且有屈尊執鞭的，出了國，於預賽中便落了選，而大部份選手，不僅是在田賽中便够不上「資格」，而於徑賽中，預賽中也總是最後一人到達。我們去的時候固然是打算吃鴨蛋而回的，但也總不見得路遠迢迢的去，是為了在世運會塲上祗跑了一百公尺便回的呢？總不見得是打算在「預賽」中就跑「殿軍」而去的吧？</p>
<p>其次，由這次世運會給我的感想的，是希特勒先生們所倡言的白色人種高於一切的荒論給予了一個事實的答覆。當希特勒先生們虐殺猶太人，倡言有色人種卑劣的時候，那種氣燄是不會使我們忘記的，然而現在怎樣呢，得了三個第一的美國選手奧文思，但却是個有色人種的「黑人」這個一向為希特勒先生們所瞧不起的有色人種，他在一屆中連得了三個錦標，這在有世運會以來是沒有的。而得馬拉拉跑第的孫基禎，他又是一個高麗人，一個被人輕視的所謂「亡國奴」！</p>
<p>我們舉出上面的例子來，那並不是說有色人種高過於白種人，我們並沒有這樣的荒謬，反之，我們正想由此證明世界上的人種是並沒有什麽高下之別的</p>
<p>由於這次「體育的國恥」聽說我們的當局預備辦一個專門為訓練選手體育學校了，地點預備假體育塲，人額是每次一千名。為了「為國爭光」，而想「雪恥，其志是可嘉的，然而訓練出一班明星制度的體育的明星來，除了在世運出出風頭（能不能是另外一個問題）之外，旁的還有什麽用處呢？於整個的中國，又有什麽益處呢？在民族存亡的緊急關頭，我們所要幹的「當務之急」似乎眞多着，這些國家的裝飾品似乎還用不到急急的來考究，不然，卽使訓練了，卽使在世運會塲上得了分還不是多個奥文思，還不是多幾個孫基禎，於我們中國何干</p>

<p>現在，你終於走了。撇開已入暮境的家庭，留下孤獨無依的妻子，勇敢地抱着一粒黃金的希望，遠渡浩瀚駕險的大洋，是那麽堅决呵，你走了！</p>
<p>我不願用一些波濤如何險惡，異國如何苛待像你這樣的旅人等來阻撓你。一切都像逆風，而你正是一隻紙鳶，你是那樣的喜歡逆風呵。風來得大，你越升得高。我曉得一切的苦難雖然磨難了你，但它並不會使你後退的，朋友，你就前進吧！</p>
<p>二十五年來你走過了一條多麽險惡的路呢！然而你終於超越了一切的危難。你臉上那疊疊的皺紋便是你的傷痕。在這樣的人世里，要建立我們的理想是多麽的困難呵！肉體上小小的傷害算得什麽呢？</p>
<p>你是蜀人，想來你必定經過長江的三峽，你不會忘記瞿塘峽與白帝城那樣的天險吧！這里，我並不是向你叙述自然拙樸的美感，我要你注意那偉大的人工，江的兩岸，在危石峭壁上開鑿出來的人行道，你不會忘記吧！它是鑿得那樣寬，那樣長，這些在對生活沒有多大信念的人是述想像也想像不出的，然而勇敢的先驅們終用着錐子，鑿子艱辛地把「路」鑿成了，供千千萬萬人行走。人生的路又不是一樣？你看過那樣偉大的工程，你該看重你自己，增了無限的勇氣吧！人，什麽危難不能克服呢？</p>
<p>你，不，我們全都走到一個荊棘叢生的原始的茂林中來了。我們為了自己，為了後一代的兒孫，我們應當拿出勇氣，給他們開闢出一條路來。世上本來是沒有「路」的，是人類化了心血精力加以開闢才有了「路」。你應當好好地借重你自己，拿出斧頭來，用自己的力量開出一條路來吧！</p>
<p>你走了，我沒有禮物送你，就用這幾句話給你餞行，這是你的愛好的朋友一顆赤熱的心，就藏着它到異國去吧！</p>
<p>願海浪更加凶惡些，它可以更使你勇敢前進的！去吧，朋友喲！</p>
<h3 id="c237">屋漏 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 雲</p>
<p>半夜裏醒來，聽見靠窗的那而有一種輕微的浙瀝淅瀝的聲音，三天之前對廂房里曾被竊賊用金鋼鑽劃破了玻璃窗，偸去許多東西，雖然我的房里除了幾堆破書破報之外，就是幾件不値錢的傢具了，如果眞的有三隻手光顧，我是不怕他會偸去一些什麽的，但是一個面目猙獰（姑且作如是想）的漢子突然從窗口里跳進來，他用電炬向四面照着，最後他發現有一個醒着的主人躺在床上和他對視着，這塲面說不定我會遇到比偸去幾件東西更重火的危險的！想着，我猛的扭亮了電炬，目光向玻璃窗上射去，窗外下着片片雨絲，玻璃窗上凝結着霧一樣的雨珠。賊的影子都沒有。　但是那種淅瀝淅瀝的聲音還是繼續着，這使我驚奇起來，於是從這一個角落到那一個角落，我在這狹小的房內謹愼地巡視着，終於在靠窗的墻上發現有水漬從屋上漏下來。那漏水的地方正安放着一架書架，和堆着的舊報，那聲音’就是雨水漏在報紙上的聲音。</p>
<p>那些不値錢的東西正是我寳貴的財產，我馬上從床上跳下來。書架因為臨空放着，沒有受損失。那堆報紙是沿墻脚堆着的，它正好做了屋漏的貯水池，從最上面的一份到最底下的一份，都吸飽了水，我貼着你，你貼着我，沒有方法把它們分離了，卽使想替它們搬動地位也是不可能的。如果滴到天明，那堆報紙不知要變成什麽模樣了。我很痛心那堆幾年來跟着我東搬西走的報紙在幾小時內完全犧牲了。</p>
<p>第二天吿訴房東昨夜的情形，他們已經去喊泥水匠了，原來受到涓涓之水的侵略的不祗我那問房間，它到處騷擾着使人不安，亭子間幾乎變成了澤國，所有面盆，脚爐滿佈着接受雨水。</p>
<p>泥水匠來了兩個，他們一整天在屋頂上修葺漏洞，調換了百來十張新瓦。昨天又下雨了，我注意着那滴漏的地方，起初印着一個圓形的水漬，漸漸化大，終於又淅瀝淅　的滴下來了。到別的房子里一問，滴水的地方還是很多。</p>
<p>房東駡泥水匠拆爛汚，另外去喊了二個，二他們戴着凉帽上屋一看，回說房子的本身太破舊了，橡木都被蛀虫彫空了，雨水已不能沿者瓦輪走路，所有椽木都吸飽了水。</p>
<p>房東呆着，他說：「這環子不是我的，大房東不肯翻造，房錢還便宜，火家馬虎點罷。」</p>
<p>受到損失的房客們沒有話說了，二房東已盡了他做二房東的責任，要修理房子本身得向大房東去談判的，但是房錢便宜，大房東的算盤上决沒有三房客的地位的，他們祗有自己的利益！</p>
<p>我把書架搬了個方向，那堆報紙忍痛地拋進了垃圾桶。從此一見窗外下雨，我就擔心着這間房子裏會突多幾處屋漏的地方，或者正在我的臥床的上面，使我不能安安穩穩的睡一覺。</p>
<p>但是大房東什麽時候才肯掏腰包來重修這房子呢？</p>

<p>(Beiping) Chen Shuren, Director of the Suiyuan-Mongolia Association Office in Beiping, stated that Suiyuan East is generally peaceful and uneventful. Li Shouxin's troops are currently eyeing Taolin. After being defeated by the Chuan Army and Da Zongguan, it is difficult for Li's troops, which were originally a rabble, to reassemble into an army in a short time. Although their intention to invade Suiyuan has not ceased, it will still take time for them to launch a large-scale operation again. It is understood that the Japanese army's reinforcements have only reached the Duolun area, and there are no traces of them in Inner Mongolia. Dewang is now recalling returning to Pangjiang.

<p>(Beiping) Zhao Fuhai, Acting Director of the Temple Mongolia Association Office in Beiping, stated that Dewang is training the Mongolian army, and due to extreme pressure from a certain party, he has no choice but to cooperate hypocritically to buffer the situation.

The Director of the Temple Mongolia Association Office in Beiping is still Bao Yueqing, who will be able to come to Beiping in two weeks. (13th, special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chen Shuren, Director of the Suiyuan-Mongolia Association Office in Beiping, stated that Li Shouxin's puppet troops previously invaded Suiyuan East together with bandits from Rehe, but were all defeated by our army. In addition to the provincial army, Suiyuan East is defended by Da Zongguan of the Zheng Huang Banner, who has now transferred the elite of the four banners to defend the positions and will never allow the bandit army to cross the line. Dewang flew back to Pangjiang from Bailing Temple on the 10th, and it is reported that he flew back to Jiabu Temple on the 11th. The Mongolian army in Rehe has recently been concentrated in Chengde and has been moving westward one after another. Judging from their actions, it seems that they intend to go directly to Suiyuan East from northern Chahar. (13th, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e8">Japanese Newspapers Criticize Foreign Minister Arita's Explanation of Foreign Policy; Feeling Difficulties in Both Northern and Southern Expansion <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita's explanation of Japanese foreign policy at Tuesday's cabinet meeting, and the military's advocacy that diplomacy should be backed by force, are the targets of criticism in today's newspapers. The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun editorial states that if a foreign policy has already been established, the people would not call for any new foreign policy. The origin of this request is only because the people do not know what foreign policy the government will adopt and feel dissatisfied with the current situation. Therefore, the responsibility of the Hirota cabinet is to re-examine foreign policy. The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that although increasing military strength in Manchuria is necessary due to the environment, the result is only to create an arms race between Japan and Russia and to make the relationship between the two countries worse. The urgent task at present is to make the Soviet Union fully understand that Japan's policy is to maintain peace in the Far East and to abandon its traditional concept of a hypothetical enemy. If this is the case, the military strength in Manchuria can be maintained to the minimum extent. The Yomiuri Shimbun pointed out that Arita's foreign policy cannot be realized, saying that Arita's reasonable foreign policy towards Russia, China, and the United Kingdom, which was promised in the last Diet session, has not been fully successful in the past six months. Even if national defense is strengthened, whether diplomatic functions can be fulfilled is a public question. This is why we must quickly determine foreign policy. What can be observed is that the general public's calls for a definite foreign policy are due to the feeling that the burden of national defense expenses is too heavy. The general impression is that maintaining equal land and naval military strength without a definite foreign policy is meaningless. Therefore, powerful factions advocate adopting a policy of defending the north and advancing to the south, believing that the islands of Southeast Asia can be used for immigration. The Japanese government has paid more attention to this since last autumn, which is indeed a fact. For example, the establishment of a South Seas Division under the Commerce Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the appointment of a naval officer as the new Governor-General of Taiwan, the improvement of the organization of the Bank of Taiwan, and the establishment of colonial companies in Taiwan are all the preliminary steps for implementing the southern expansion policy. Japan is now finding it difficult to choose whether to adopt a northern or southern expansion policy, as the former would lead to a conflict with the Soviet Union, while the latter would risk a conflict with the United Kingdom. Therefore, Japan is deeply concerned about the issue of where the focus of national defense goals lies. However, from a political, economic, and diplomatic point of view, public opinion on Japanese foreign policy seems to favor the southern expansion theory. (13th, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) According to a dispatch from Suiyuan, last year, due to the armed attacks on the Wangfu by Mantu Yixi Great Lama and others, Shilab Dorji, the Zhasake of the Xigong Banner of the Wumeng League, and the two sides fought several times. After mediation from various parties, Prince Shi was ordered by the Executive Yuan to suspend his duties for eight months, which has now expired. After Fu Zuoyi obtained approval from the Executive Yuan for his request to resume his duties, Prince Shi returned to the Wangfu some days ago to handle the resumption of his duties. Unexpectedly, the Great Lama suddenly led his troops to attack the Wangfu again at the beginning of this month. Prince Shi received the news and also deployed troops to wait for the attack. The two sides then clashed again on the 6th of this month near Sedeng Hulutou Township in the Second District of Baotou, and a fierce battle broke out. Prince Shi's army had about 50 soldiers, while the Great Lama's army had about 70 soldiers. Because the Great Lama had sophisticated weapons and ammunition, Prince Shi was unable to resist and retreated step by step. The Great Lama led his troops in hot pursuit, and on the evening of the 9th, the Wang army retreated to the vicinity of Jiagesheng Temple, where they were overtaken by the Great Lama. The two sides confronted each other for several hours, and another fierce battle broke out at dawn on the 10th, which continued until 5:00 PM without stopping. After receiving a telephone report from the Third District, the Baotou County Government immediately dispatched Yang Yingnan, Deputy Director of the Security Department, to the Third District on the evening of the 10th to command the stationed security team to strictly guard the border crossings to prevent incursions into the county and maintain local security.

<h3 id="e11">Chairman Chiang's Trip South <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang recently flew from Guling to Guangzhou and was warmly welcomed by all circles there. This kind of public enthusiasm is well-deserved for him. Guangzhou is where Chiang's revolutionary career started and where he swore an oath to launch the Northern Expedition in the 15th year of the Republic of China. More than ten years have passed since he led the National Revolutionary Army out of Shaoguan in July of that year. During this period, he has overcome numerous obstacles for the sake of the Party and the country and achieved many great accomplishments. Only now does he have the opportunity to return to this revolutionary base. From this point alone, it can be said that Chiang's trip is a historical event.</p>
<p>Moreover, Chiang's trip has even greater significance for the country, because he is definitely not going for sightseeing. This time he went to Guangzhou to plan the aftermath of the Guangdong situation and to mediate the peace of the Guangxi situation. During the era when Chen Jitang was in power in Guangdong, there were numerous miscellaneous taxes, opium dens and gambling houses were everywhere, and corruption was rampant. Now that Chen has abandoned his post and left, although all political affairs have been taken over by personnel sent by the Central Government, it will take time to sort out the thousands of threads. Chiang's personal visit to Guangdong will of course enable administrative efficiency to be increased as much as possible and various difficulties will be solved easily. Guangdong and Guangxi provinces are closely related. If the reorganization of Guangdong can be effective as soon as possible, then the settlement of the Guangxi situation will also be easier to achieve.</p>
<p>As for the Guangxi situation, after Chen Jitang left, Li and Bai expressed that they would no longer resist orders and would obey the Central Government, but soon they refused to accept the new orders. Therefore, the Guangxi situation, which was about to be resolved, was complicated, and the people of the country had many worries again. Chairman Chiang, based on the proposition of peaceful reunification, sent two telegrams from Guling, one to Li and Bai to explain the doubts and the other to persuade Li and Bai to get rid of the Guangxi affairs and accept the new orders. His words were sincere and earnest. This time he went to Guangzhou and still maintained his original intention, sending Xiang Hanping and Deng Shizeng to Nanning to make earnest persuasion to Li and Bai again. We believe that Li and Bai are also generals who have contributed to the National Revolution. At this time of serious national crisis and the re-emergence of alarms in Suiyuan East, after Chiang's explanation and persuasion, they will abandon their prejudices, take the survival of the country and nation as the premise, and unite and cooperate with the gentlemen of the Central Government.</p>
<p>Based on our sincere concern for the country, we hope that the situation in Guangdong and Guangxi can have a bright and brilliant new development in the near future due to Chairman Chiang's arrangements.</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Tianjin military police and customs officials intercepted smuggled goods in the suburbs. On the 13th, they intercepted seven cases of sugar and rayon being transported by ronin, all of which were handed over to the customs for detention. The customs impose two types of punishment on Chinese merchants who commit smuggling: fines and confiscation of goods. In cases of serious circumstances, they are transferred to the court. (13th, special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The total value of rayon stored in Tianjin is estimated at tens of millions of yuan, with the most in a certain concession. The customs affix seals to the goods of Chinese-owned rayon fabric factories after inspection and verification, and each manufacturer is allowed to quickly transport the goods for export and sale. (13th, special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A total of 346 weaving and dyeing factories in Tianjin have registered with the customs, producing 310,000 bolts of rayon fabrics, but there are still hundreds of factories that have not reported. (13th, special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Because ronin smuggle goods and often insert the Japanese flag into vehicles and ships, using it as a military amulet, many cases of insulting the national flag and diplomacy have occurred recently. On the 13th, the Japanese Consulate General in Tianjin specifically convened transportation merchants and stipulated: 1. It is forbidden to insert the Japanese flag when transporting goods to the Chinese boundary. 2. If cargo owners use the national flag to facilitate transportation, the cargo owner's address, name, purpose, and type of goods must be investigated so that the incident can be investigated.

<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the establishment of a naval port between Tanggu and Dagu, the Japanese Navy's Tianjin Military Officer's Office cooperated with the South Manchuria Railway's technical commission to conduct a survey, which took two months. Recently, it has been completed. On the 13th, Kubota, the Tianjin military officer of the navy, met with Noda, the head of the investigation section of the South Manchuria Railway, to discuss and create a plan, which was submitted to the military department for review. Because the river channel between Tanggu and Tianjin is shallow and winding, it must be dredged, which will take at least five years. After success, ships with a draft of 5,000 tons can pass through to Tianjin. The navy believes that this huge project is difficult and plans to change the Tianjin-Dagu road to a tram line, or ask Beining to lay a duplicate line from Tianjin to Tanggu, and then rebuild the Dagu pier, taking the water and land connection. This plan is submitted together for approval. (13th, special dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hankou) Ling Hongxun, Director of the Yuehan Railway Bureau, told this newspaper reporter on the 13th that the Southern Bureau's reception of the entire railway administration will announce the unification. The Jiufeng Iron Bridge near Pengshi in the Southern Section was previously bombed by the Guangdong army, and a temporary wooden bridge was built to replace it. It was then washed away by floods, but it has now been repaired. The unfinished projects in the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section have also been largely completed, and there are no obstacles along the way. Express trains are now running from Wuchang to Hengzhou and from Lechang to Guangzhou. Interval trains run from Chongzhou to Lechang in the middle section. In fact, they are all open to traffic, but the entire line is not directly connected. A total of five trains purchased in England have been transported here, and third-class passenger cars have already arrived. The first and second-class cars can be transported within the month. It is specifically set that the entire line will officially open to traffic on the first of next month, requiring 40 hours to arrive directly. The organization of the railway bureau is more rational, with the transportation department managing vehicles and locomotives, the business department managing business, and the factory affairs department managing the machine factory. Although the bureau is located in Wuchang, it will still be moved to Hengzhou in the future, with Hengzhou as the center of the entire line. It is also heard that a grand ceremony will be held when the road opens to traffic, and people from all walks of life will be invited to visit the entire road. (13th, special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Because the opening of the Yuehan Railway is imminent, and there is no suitable station factory in Wuchang, the Yuehan Railway Bureau decided to move the Tongxiangmen Station to Binyangmen and expand the construction. It is currently under design. (13th, special dispatch)</p>

<p>Anglo-Egyptian Treaty Concluded, Officially Signed in London on the 27th</p>
<p>Alexandria, Egypt. Negotiations between Egypt and Britain on the conclusion of a new treaty have been underway since March of this year, lasting several months. The clauses concerning military affairs and the Sudan issue have been agreed upon and initialed successively. The clauses on consular jurisdiction have also been agreed upon and initialed this afternoon. Afterwards, a public statement was issued, saying, "The representatives of both sides held a plenary meeting at 7:00 PM today, and all the outstanding clauses in the new Anglo-Egyptian treaty were drafted." With this, the negotiations between the two countries came to an end. Once the Egyptian delegation arrives in London, the official signing ceremony can be held, and the date has been set for the 27th of this month. Egypt will immediately apply to join the League of Nations after the signing. (Havas dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(London) Negotiations between Britain and Egypt on the new treaty have ended, and various clauses have been initialed yesterday. The attention of the newspapers here has now shifted to this matter, and they are not as concerned about the Spanish unrest as they were in the past few days, because Germany and Italy seem to be preparing to negotiate, and the international situation is not expected to cause a crisis for the time being. Among them, the Morning Post published a commentary on the new Anglo-Egyptian treaty, saying, "Since Egypt broke away from British protection and declared independence in 1922, the relationship between Britain and Egypt has been complicated, complex, and very unstable. Now that the delegations of both sides have agreed on a new treaty, the friendly relations between the two countries will surely be strengthened. As for Egypt, the page of Muhammad Ali's reign, which is also a page of the country's struggle for independent sovereignty, has now come to an end, which is not something to celebrate." The newspaper then said, "The Suez Canal is a vital transportation route for the British Empire. If Egypt is the only guardian and is responsible for safeguarding its independence, then the future safety cannot but worry people. Therefore, to say that after the new treaty is concluded, the security of the Empire and Egypt will be established is something that we cannot agree with." (Havas dispatch from the 13th)</p>

<p>China's Trade Surplus with the United States Reaches More Than 1.78 Million US Dollars</p>
<p>(Washington) The Department of Commerce announced today in its international trade report that China's trade surplus with the United States in June reached US$1,789,000. In the six months before June 22, China's trade surplus with the United States totaled US$22,917,000. This statistic further increases the good impression of the United States on the Chinese government's new monetary policy. It is believed here that China's trade surplus can increase exchange credit in the United States, which is a significant sign of currency stability. According to economic experts, China's trade surplus is due to the economic recovery of the United States, which has increased the demand for Chinese goods. In addition, the reduction of Chinese imports is also one of the reasons for this trade surplus. The total value of US exports to China in June was US$5,134,000, while the value in the same period last year was US$2,295,000. The total value of Chinese goods imported by the United States in June was US$6,923,000, while the value in the same period last year was US$4,891,000. In the first six months of this year, US exports to China totaled US$20,990,000, and imports totaled US$43,907,000. Last year, US exports to China totaled US$22,661,000, and imports totaled US$30,341,000. (National Telegram from the 12th)</p>
<p>Serious Situation in Palestine, Arabs Massacre British Soldiers</p>
<p>Jerusalem. Yesterday, ten British soldiers were resting near the Isdraelon Valley, and eight of them were bathing in a small pool. Suddenly, more than 30 Arabs attacked, resulting in the death of one British non-commissioned officer and injuries to three soldiers. At that time, the Arabs were approaching stealthily, first knocking down two sentries, and then opening fire on the soldiers. The British army was caught off guard and did not have time to take up their guns to fight back. The deceased was a corporal. After the Arabs seized the uniforms, guns, and ammunition left by the British soldiers by the pool, they fled into the nearby mountains. A large number of troops and border guards from Transjordan have been dispatched to search the surrounding areas with the help of aircraft. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>Center of Spanish Warfare Shifts Again to Near the Portuguese Border, Government Troops Defend Important Town Under Siege, Rebel Giant Planes Bomb</p>
<p>Madrid. Badajoz, the capital of the province of Badajoz near the Portuguese border, has recently been completely surrounded by rebel troops and is expected to fall soon. Although Chiclana, a town in the province of Huelva, is still defended by government troops, the situation is very serious, and it is believed that it will be occupied by the rebel army soon. After a short but fierce battle yesterday, the rebel army defeated the government army and attacked Badajoz. Starting at 4:00 PM, they bombarded the city fiercely and used four three-engine planes to continuously drop bombs on this city, which was as precarious as a pile of eggs. Yesterday, from the top of a small hill on the Portuguese border, it could be seen that the people of Badajoz were fleeing in all directions, and women and children were crossing the international bridge over the Guadiana River into Portuguese territory. The Portuguese border guards were busy inspecting and confiscating weapons, and the men were being detained. A rebel plane dropped a bomb on the refugees crowded on the international bridge trying to cross the river, resulting in about 20 deaths. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>Madrid. The war for supremacy in Spain is intensifying, and the decisive battle will not be far away. Although Madrid remains as peaceful as usual, on the northern Guadarrama front, the government is using its superior forces to put pressure on the rebel army led by General Mola. Mola's troops are now moving between Burgos and Zaragoza, trying to hold on. As for the rebel leader General Franco, he has a strong presence in the south, but the rebel forces in the north and south have not yet been able to make contact west of Madrid, because the government forces are now firmly defending Badajoz, and although Franco's planes have repeatedly bombed it, they have not given up. It is said that Franco's troops are now planning to launch an offensive, and there may be a major conflict on the coast near Malaga. Rebel troops and fascists are carrying machine guns and transport vehicles and are advancing to attack the government's main naval base. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>Burgos. It has recently been learned that the revolutionary army has made continuous progress in the positions it occupies today. On the northern Guipuzcoa front, the revolutionary army has successively occupied the two cities of Eibar and Villabona. The former is between Tolosa and Zumaya, and although it is a small town, it has an arsenal, and the ammunition needed by the government army in San Sebastian is supplied from here. The latter is six kilometers north of Tolosa. After the revolutionary army obtained these two places, its positions in the Tolosa area were immediately consolidated. Tolosa is a northern industrial center with a population of 10,000 and is the center of Guipuzcoa Province. Now that the area has fallen into the hands of the revolutionary army, San Sebastian has been seriously threatened. As for the southern front, according to news from Seville, the government army in Badajoz has been isolated and will soon surrender to the revolutionary army. The city of Merida to the east has long been occupied by the revolutionary army, so General Franco, commander of the southern front, and General Mola, commander of the northern front, have made contact there. Looking at the overall situation, the provinces and regions currently controlled by the revolutionary army include Galicia, Leon, and Asturias in the northwest, the Extremadura region in the west (except for Badajoz Province), the Andalusia region in the south (except for Malaga and Jaen provinces), Navarre and Old Castile in the north, and Aragon in the northeast, which is more than half of the country. (Havas dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>Madrid. In northern Spain, the government army and the rebel army are engaged in a battle for the coastline of San Sebastian and Irun. Tolosa, which was captured by the rebel army, is the throat of San Sebastian and is a strategic location that soldiers must fight for. However, the government army is confident that it will win the final battle and claims that government planes have bombed the rebel barracks and forts in Granada, dropping a total of 10,000 pounds of bombs, and shot down two rebel planes near the city. In addition, 20 bombers have arrived in Madrid, six in Valencia, and four in Catalonia to replenish the government air force. From this, it can be seen that the government army has a good chance of turning defeat into victory in a few days. It is now heard that four bombers are about to bomb the rebel positions in Cordoba, Seville, and Puente Genil. (National Telegram from the 12th)</p>
<p>Spanish Civil War, Both Sides Kill Each Other Miserably, Rebel Army Benefits from Air Transport, Transporting No Fewer Than Twelve Planes of Soldiers Every Day</p>
<p>Madrid. The current military situation in Spain can be summarized as follows: In the most recent period, neither side has been able to occupy a larger city. Although the government army in the north has indeed posed a considerable threat to Zaragoza and Huesca, it is also under considerable pressure from the rebel army in the Irun and San Sebastian areas. At present, two rebel ships have sailed to the above two places to assist in the battle.</p>
<p>Although the government army in southern Spain is currently using guerrilla tactics, there are already signs that General Franco's position is unfavorable. The air force stationed in Seville by General Franco is the most powerful weapon and is now increasing daily. No fewer than twelve planes are transporting troops from Morocco to mainland Spain every day, but the source is unknown. The rebel army transported from Morocco has repeatedly launched surprise attacks in various villages in the south because they are suspected of being loyal to the government, and the killings are very tragic, especially by the Moorish native army. The looting methods they use are extremely terrifying. Anyone who is even slightly suspected will be shot without mercy. Civilians and others who are captured in various villages pay money as the price for the looters to stop their atrocities. The newspapers even publish eulogies to encourage them, such as an editorial in a newspaper edited by a fascist bullfighter in Cordoba, threatening the people who have surrendered to the government, entitled "We will tear their bodies apart like butchering pigs."</p>
<p>At present, illegal incidents are frequently seen in Spain, which is due to the indiscriminate distribution of modern weapons to rude farmers. For example, the government recruited shepherds from the mountains of Granada who were accustomed to throwing stones and taught them how to use hand grenades. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>Rebels Throw 100 Bombs in 20 Minutes, Both Sides Use Aircraft in Combat, Many Civilians Tragically Killed by Bombing</p>
<p>Lisbon. The local radio broadcasting company recently released a message claiming that four planes belonging to the Spanish rebel army departed from Seville last night and flew to Badajoz to drop bombs, dropping a total of 100 bombs of various sizes weighing 30 kilograms each in 20 minutes. (Havas dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>Hendaye, France. At the beginning of the Spanish unrest, the government army and the rebel army rarely used air force in combat. Recently, the activities of aircraft on both sides have become increasingly active. This morning, a rebel plane in the north flew to Pasajes to bomb indiscriminately. Many civilians were tragically killed by the bombing. After the government army sent the wounded to the hospital for treatment, it immediately dispatched two planes from the Renteria airfield near San Sebastian to chase the enemy plane. The plane knew that it could not win and fled to the southeast. It is said that it once flew over French territory, but only for a short time. In addition, government planes also flew to San Sebastian and the rebel positions near Renteria this morning to conduct reconnaissance for a long time. It is likely that the government army intends to launch a major offensive, so it is conducting reconnaissance first. Gunshots have been heard in the area since 6:30 this morning, indicating that the war has resumed. The rebel army has been planning to attack Pasajes for a long time, and its planes have been conducting reconnaissance in the villages near the port for days, indicating that its intentions have been planned for more than a day. The government army has probably seen through this strategy, so in order to contain the enemy, it has detained all the prisoners in the military locations that the enemy's artillery can bombard and warned the rebel army to stop firing, otherwise it will execute the prisoners as retaliation.

<p>Twenty-Five German Planes Arrive at Rebel Headquarters in Spain, Seven Italian Bombers Also Arrive, New York Times Reporter Witnessed</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Times today carried shocking news from a reporter stationed in Seville, Spain, saying that twenty German Junkers heavy bombers and five chase planes, all driven by German military aviators, have flown to the Seville rebel headquarters. This news was sent to Gibraltar by the reporter and then telegraphed to New York. According to the reporter, he personally saw several new German planes, and the pilots were not wearing uniforms. However, the German consul in Seville admitted in private that the personnel were German military aviators. It was also heard from Germans in Seville that the personnel will no longer fly these new planes in the future, but will teach the Spanish how to fly. It was also heard that within a few days, seven Italian Caproni bombers will also arrive in Seville. (Reuters dispatch from the 12th)</p>

<p>Hendaye, France. Government forces are besieging the cities of Toledo, Gijon, and Oviedo today. The residents of the cities are afraid of famine. Although there is a great disparity in the number of government forces and rebel forces, the rebel forces in the cities are still resisting stubbornly. According to a rebel soldier who escaped from Gijon, the situation in the city is very critical. The defenders slaughtered the last horse on Tuesday to fill their stomachs. The rebel general in Oviedo asked the government forces to allow the residents of the city to go out of the city to fetch water for one hour each day. The government forces refused and demanded that the rebel forces surrender unconditionally. Refugees who escaped from Toledo also narrated the tragic situation in the city and the famine among the rebel women and children. (National Telegram from the 12th)</p>
<p>Hendaye, France. A special dispatch from our reporter: Government forces in Guipuzcoa, Spain, have renovated the positions they occupy yesterday. Their positions near Tolosa are still sufficient to control the main roads everywhere. Therefore, although the rebel army has occupied the city, it is not important in the eyes of the government army. In addition, the rebel army attacked the city of Villabona to the south of the city yesterday and was repelled by the government army. The two sides fought fiercely for several hours. The rebel leader once captured an armored car from the government army and killed two soldiers in the car, but in the end, they were still unable to support and retreated. Afterwards, it was heard that the government army executed two wealthy merchants from Tolosa who had been taken hostage in the army as retaliation. Since this morning, the Spanish border has been completely closed. Except for vehicles carrying diplomatic officials, all other vehicles are not allowed to enter the country. According to a person from the Popular Front in the country, the government authorities have taken this measure to prevent the leakage of military secrets and hinder the war. (Havas dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>Madrid. The Spanish government announced today that the Asturian miners besieging the city of Oviedo have defeated a column of rebel troops attacking the government forces. At the same time, the government militia that recovered the island of Ibiza in the Balearic Islands was warmly welcomed by the public when it returned to Valencia. The militia will attack Majorca again within days. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>Madrid. Regarding the war situation, Interior Minister Pozas stated last night that the militias belonging to the government army in the Somosierra Pass and the Guadarrama Mountains near the capital recently besieged Colonel Aranda's troops who were still trapped in the city of Oviedo. A column of rebel troops attempted to rush to the rescue, but was defeated by the militias of the province. In addition, Colonel Asensio, the former military attaché of the Spanish Embassy in Portugal, told our reporter that the capital Madrid is no longer in danger of being captured by the rebel army, and the rebel army is suffering from food shortages and is exhausted. They are even more disappointed that the reinforcements they were expecting have not arrived. In addition, Prime Minister Quirol stated that President Azana has ordered the dissolution of all monasteries in the country. Furthermore, the Standing Committee of the House of Representatives, which is currently in recess, will meet today to extend the validity period of the various emergency decrees promulgated by the government since the outbreak of the unrest. (Havas dispatch from the 13th)</p>

<h3 id="e39">Soviet Russia Advances Conscription Age, Germans Believe It Creates a New Situation, Saying It Will Affect the Five-Power European Conference, Japanese Ambassador Ota Returns Home with Reflections <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) Various newspapers here report that because Soviet Russia has reduced the age for conscription to 19 in order to increase the number of army personnel, they all predict that various difficulties will arise when the Locarno Five-Power Conference is held this autumn. People here all believe that this action by the Soviet authorities has created a new situation. Berlin newspapers all believe that the political events before and simultaneous with this Soviet action clearly reveal the aggressive nature of the Soviet Union's military buildup. The Berlin Daily News commented on the current situation, saying that there is no greater danger from the East than there is today. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to news from Moscow, the Soviet People's Committee yesterday issued an order advancing the starting age for compulsory military service from 21 to 19. Political figures here were shocked upon hearing the news, believing that the Soviet Union's advance of the military service age would increase its army personnel by 50 percent. It is generally expected that by next year, the country's regular army will have 2 million soldiers, and the reserve army will be 6 million. This is a great danger for Germany. The Berlin Daily News reported that the Soviet Union is sparing no effort in strengthening its military. After the Five-Power Conference is held in the future, Germany's advocacy of a West European non-aggression pact will be even more justified. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Tsuruga: Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Ota, arrived in Tsuruga at 7 AM on the 13th with his wife and daughter aboard the Siberia Maru from Vladivostok. They then took an international train east. On the train, he told reporters, "I only heard about the detention of personnel from the Japanese Embassy in the Soviet Union while en route. When I was in Moscow, the Soviet side consistently expressed very good intentions. However, not long after I left the Soviet Union, this incident occurred. I do not understand what the real meaning is. Soviet People's Commissar of Defense Voroshilov specifically told me at the farewell banquet when I was returning home that the Soviet Union would absolutely not provoke other countries and asked me to convey this to the Japanese government after returning home. However, it is not known whether these words are true. Although there are frequent rumors of Japan and the Soviet Union going to war, what is the purpose and why must we engage in war? War is not a simple matter. I believe that the Soviet Union's build-up of military equipment is in preparation for invasion by other countries. Ambassadors to the Soviet Union all advocate Japanese-Soviet friendship. Once they return home and hold key positions in the government, they strongly advocate that relations with the Soviet Union are dangerous. Diplomats should not stop until they fully understand the truth when they meet someone. This is probably unavoidable. Therefore, what I say today may all be false, and that is also possible."

<p>Honolulu: The defense of the Hawaiian Islands by the Army and Navy is now impeccable. However, Army and Navy officers still believe that the Air Force needs to be urgently supplemented. The Hickam Airfield, built by the War Department with $18,000,000, is currently under construction. After the completion of Hickam Airfield, along with Luke Airfield and Wheeler Airfield, it can accommodate 200 to 300 aircraft. The Hawaiian Military District also advocates transforming the ancient Kauai Island northwest of Oahu Island and the Hawaiian Island 200 miles away into air base, so that they can become powerful forward observation stations. Currently, the expenses for expanding the Air Force are more than the expenses for the Army and Pearl Harbor Naval Base. The Navy has already tendered for a $10,000,000 floating dock. The $1,500,000 Pearl Harbor dredging project will also be put out to tender. (National News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Correction: In yesterday's dispatch from Honolulu on the 11th sent by our agency, this year's expenses should be corrected as follows: the total amount is 20 million US dollars, of which the Navy accounts for approximately 13 million US dollars, and the Army accounts for approximately 7 million US dollars.

<p>(Paris) The Senate today discussed the bill on replacing old Air Force aircraft with new ones and daily repairs, and passed it with a unanimous vote. The implementation period of this plan is set at five years, with an annual expenditure of 550,000,000 francs, used to add 1,000 aircraft to replace old ones. During the discussion, Aviation Minister Côte gave a speech, roughly saying, "The total number of aircraft manufactured by France by the end of this year will reach 1,023. However, these aircraft are quickly becoming obsolete. We are now ordering new aircraft to replace them. In short, the government must do its best to ensure that the country has adequate air force equipment to maintain national defense. Maintaining peace also depends on it." (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The five-year Air Force plan passed by the French Chamber of Deputies, which stipulates an annual expenditure of 550 million francs, was unanimously passed by the Senate today.

Aviation Minister Côte also reported to the Senate today that France's air force strength must not lag behind other countries. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e42">Pacific Institute Meeting Opens in the United States This Week Focus on Japan in Discussions <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Yosemite National Park, USA: The Sixth Conference of the Pacific Institute will open here this week. At that time, the sudden development of Japan in international trade and economics since its invasion of Manchuria on September 18, 1931, will be discussed in detail. The conference has also asked representatives from China, Japan, the United States, and Russia to clearly state their respective Pacific policies. Members of the institute have also collected extensive materials over the past two years to be presented at the meeting. Regarding the Japan issue, the first aspect is the nature and extent of Japan's external development in recent years. The conference will attempt to determine the scope of Japan's commercial development since 1931 and its monetary value. It will also study the impact of this development on world commerce and the commerce of other Pacific countries. Whether the development in Asia, Africa, and South America is to open up new markets or to seize the markets of other countries, and what is the relationship between the establishment of "Manchukuo" and the commercial development of Japan. That is, whether this development relies solely on the progress of Japan's domestic economic conditions, or whether it is also due to the rich resources of "Manchukuo" that it has been able to achieve this. The conference will also pay special attention to the following points, namely Japan's (1) investment in Manchuria, (2) military actions, and (3) the extent to which government and chaebol subsidies have contributed to this development. Regarding Japan's future economic development policies, the conference will also study two issues. First, whether Japan has formally considered the economic development policies for Manchuria and North China, and second, whether there is a definite plan for Sino-Japanese-"Manchu" economic cooperation. In addition, the conference will also study the relationship between Japan's monetary policy and commercial development, namely how much impact the devaluation of the yen has had, and the reasons for the devaluation, whether it is intended to promote foreign trade, restrict domestic price tightening, or whether it is due to the devaluation of the pound sterling, and whether the yen price can be used as a stable basis. There are also several other issues, listed as follows: (1) What impact does the rise of the world's arms, steel, and chemical industries have on Japan's competition in the world market? (2) What is the relationship between Japan's new investments and new markets in Manchuria and the development of Japan's foreign trade? (3) What impact do the economic crisis and recovery plan in the United States have on Japanese commerce? (4) Is the active competition of Japanese goods in India and the Dutch East Indies caused by the decline of Japanese goods in the Chinese market? (5) How much has the Japanese government's subsidies to the export and transportation industries and other direct assistance since 1931 contributed to commercial development? The conference will finally study the international issues of Japan's national policy, commerce, and monetary system. First, what kind of threats do Pacific countries feel due to Japan's commercial competition? That is, what are the dangers of importing Japanese goods into their own countries and the encroachment of Japanese goods on markets in other countries? Second, what interests are affected by the disputes between Japan and India, the disputes with the Dutch East Indies, the disputes with Canada, and the dissatisfaction of various countries with the closure of the door in Manchuria and North China? Third, how much diplomatic and military pressure will the Japanese government use to obtain tax reductions and other benefits from China that make it difficult for other countries to compete? Fifth, whether Japan can reduce competition in other markets if it reopens the markets in North China and Manchuria? Fifth, what attitude will countries such as Britain and the United States take if Japan further closes the door in North China and Manchuria, and even Central China? (National News Agency, 12th)</p>

<h3 id="e64">American Spy Panic <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Yi Sheng</p>
<p>As the winds of World War II grow tighter by the day, so too do foreign spies along the American coast increase by the day. In the past year alone, it is estimated that European countries spent 50 million US dollars on espionage. In Asia, Japan alone spent 12 million US dollars. They are using various clever methods to steal the secrets of various new and ingenious military weapons.</p>
<p>In recent years, the United States has made many inventions in new military equipment, with the range of mountain guns and mortars exceeding expectations. Semi-automatic rifles can turn every infantryman into a machine gunner. One type of machine gun can fire 150 high-explosive bombs per minute, and a tank driven by seven people can travel at sixty miles per hour. There is also a liquid substance composed of chemicals, gasoline, and explosives, which, if dropped from an airplane, can turn enemy houses into ashes. Although the Army and Navy Departments maintain extreme secrecy regarding the testing of new inventions, foreign spies will do everything possible to find out as soon as they hear about them. Not long ago, the American Martin and Sikorsky aircraft factories successfully manufactured a super aircraft. As soon as this news came out, arms dealers from five countries rushed to the two factories, demanding a preview. Most of these arms dealers are reserve officers who can report directly to their own general staff at any time.</p>
<p>A few months ago, on the docks of New York, just before the Norddeutscher Lloyd ship Europa was about to set sail, a person in civilian clothes, carrying a violin case, strode onto the gangplank, intending to board the ship. At this moment, a plainclothes detective stepped forward, detained him, and found in the violin case a large number of military maps, secret documents, weapons blueprints, the latest aircraft designs, and blueprints for foldable machine guns used in newly invented fighter planes. It turned out that the man wanted to hand the violin case to a steward on the ship, who would then take it to a certain country in Europe. This act of espionage was only dealt with by deportation, because American laws against espionage are very lenient.</p>
<p>Not long ago, a foreign spy came to the United States and became friends with a reserve officer. The officer was proficient in chemistry and had worked in government agencies. The spy bribed him with 25,000 US dollars to steal a copy of the formula for the chemicals used in American army gas masks. The officer, in urgent need of money, went to a certain deputy in the chemistry lab and promised him a reward of 10,000 US dollars. Unexpectedly, the deputy informed the director of this matter. As a result, the officer only received the punishment of dismissal.</p>
<p>Also, a certain important American official was traveling home by train from Washington, D.C. The briefcase he was carrying contained various designs related to national defense. During the journey, two strangers came to talk to him, and after getting off the train, they followed him. Not long after, he discovered that the desk in his office had been pried open. It turned out that someone had secretly given his servant 500 dollars to steal the important documents.</p>
<p>Waste paper from government agencies is often bought by people from the janitors for large sums of money. The US Patent Office is also a place frequented by spies. They often carry large sums of money to visit inventors and seek technical secrets. The inventor of the American new-style tank, Christie, once rejected their request, and they replied, "You'd better sell it, otherwise, we'll steal it anyway."</p>
<p>In February of this year, the US Army Department, in order to be cautious about military secrets, issued very strict instructions. Anyone who leaks any military secrets to anyone will be sentenced to two years in prison. Anyone who sells or gives military secrets to foreigners will be sentenced to twenty years in prison.</p>
<p>Not long ago, a foreign scientist, while slowly touring a certain arsenal, suddenly lifted his coat and used a small camera attached to his suspenders to photograph a certain important component. This small camera looked like a button on the suspenders. Fortunately, it was immediately discovered by the factory personnel.</p>
<p>The US Navy seems to be threatened by a fleet of spy ships. This sounds strange. However, the American naval and army officers firmly believe it, because there is a fleet diagram drawn by government surveyors as evidence. The diagram depicts a large fishing boat with a continuous cruising range of eight thousand miles, equipped with powerful searchlights and wireless radios. There are now as many as 250 of these ships along the American Pacific coast. They usually travel back and forth under the guise of fishing, and in wartime, the fish holds and bait storage rooms inside the ships can be immediately converted into mines and torpedo tubes. Moreover, most of the crew members are naval reservists who can start attacking American warships one hour after the two countries go to war. Recently, these disguised warships have been closely following the American fleet at all times, especially when American warships are conducting target practice.</p>
<p>Because the laws are too lenient, it is very difficult to crack down on spies. A famous government secret agent once said, "Catching kidnappers is easier than catching spies."</p>

<h3 id="e65">Japanese Merchants Acquire Huaxin Yarn Factory for 1.2 Million Yuan; Buyer is Kanegafuchi Spinning Company <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The Huaxin Yarn Factory has been sold to the Japanese. A preliminary agreement was signed on the evening of the 9th. The buyer is the Japanese Kanegafuchi Spinning Company. The signing took place at the residence of Liu Junqing, a director of Huaxin Yarn Factory. The Japanese representative was Kurachi, a director of Kanegafuchi Spinning Company, and the Huaxin representative was Liu Junqing. Xu Jishang was also present, and the lawyer Lin Xinggui acted as a witness. The selling price is 1.2 million yuan. The preliminary agreement consists of five items: (1) A deposit of 100,000 yuan will be paid on the signing date; (2) The remaining 1.1 million yuan will be paid in full upon taking over the factory; (3) The existing stock of cotton yarn, etc., will be paid for in cash by the new owner at a discounted price; (4) All factory employees will be retained for three months, and all workers will be retained for six months; (5) This agreement is effective from the date of signing. On the 11th, Kurachi, accompanied by several Japanese technicians, inspected the Huaxin Yarn Factory to examine the machinery, and it was decided that the takeover would be completed within twenty days. On September 1st, work will be suspended for five days to complete the takeover procedures, clean up the interior, and dismiss workers, etc. It is agreed by both parties that all relevant regulations will comply with the factory laws of our Ministry of Industry. After the new owner takes over, the factory name will be changed to Gongda No. 7 Factory. Repairs to the machinery, as well as the addition of new machines and looms, will have to wait until next year. For the time being, the status quo will be maintained, and work will resume on September 6th. The factory has a total of 32,000 old and new yarn spindles, with 25,000 currently in operation, and 1,400 workers. The Tangshan, Qingdao, and Weihui factories are unrelated to this and operate independently. The name "Gongda No. 7 Factory" is based on the order in which Kanegafuchi Spinning Company's yarn factories are arranged in its own country. The Tianjin Yuyuan Yarn Factory was also acquired by Kanegafuchi Spinning Company and renamed Gongda No. 6 Factory. Therefore, in Tianjin alone, Kanegafuchi Spinning Company now has two factories, with a total of 106,000 yarn spindles (74,000 in Yuyuan). Recently, Kurachi came to North China to investigate and is planning to build a yarn factory in Shihe. If this is realized, then the company's yarn industry power will be enough to control the overall situation in North China.</p>
<p>Huaxin's sale this time is partly blamed on the difference of opinion among the directors, with many holding dissenting views and advocating for selling off the factory to avoid further losses, and partly blamed on the Tianjin industrial and financial circles and the government sitting idly by without providing assistance. The banking syndicate, having already invested in establishing the Chengfu Trust Company to manage the Beiyang and Hengyuan yarn factories, with a total investment of more than 1.4 million yuan, seems to have no intention of investing further substantial funds in operating Huaxin. The Social Affairs Bureau, which is related to the yarn factory business, has recently undergone frequent personnel changes, with the director changing repeatedly, and almost no one paying attention to this matter. Although a special commissioner was dispatched to investigate, there was no effective way to provide relief. A week ago, Huaxin proposed a self-rescue plan, earnestly requesting government officials to negotiate with the banking community to borrow 1.5 million yuan, with 1 million yuan to be used to repay foreign debts and shareholder deposits, and 500,000 yuan to be used to purchase new machines to compete with the Japanese. However, the Social Affairs Bureau did not pay attention to it, and the banking community was unwilling to accept the factory's request. Under the delay, the Japanese side actively proceeded. Initially, the Japanese Toyo Spinning Company and Kanegafuchi Spinning Company offered equal prices, and the competition was fierce. They sought direct intervention from the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin. The Japanese Consul-General found it difficult to mediate and transferred the matter to the military for arbitration. The military, because Toyo Spinning Company had already built a large-scale Yufeng branch factory in Tianjin, in order to ensure a balanced business power between the two entities in the future and avoid an excessively skewed situation, ruled that Kanegafuchi Spinning Company should acquire the factory. After receiving the promise, the company successfully negotiated the deal within a few days. From now on, Huaxin is no longer ours. (11th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">Situation After the Puppet Troops Disturbed Eastern Suiyuan; A Certain Party's Supervising Team Arrives in Zhangbei; It is Rumored that Fu Zuoyi is Doing His Utmost to Preserve the Territory <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Beijing Dispatch: The joint intrusion into Eastern Suiyuan by bandits and puppet troops from Chahar has aroused attention and concern from all parties. Although the tense situation in that area has not diminished slightly since the 4th of this month, there have been no significant changes in the situation. Whether this issue will escalate completely depends on a certain party that is in control. According to a certain person familiar with the situation in Mongolia, it is an undeniable fact that a certain party is plotting to control Mongolia, and this has been going on for a long time. However, the current path has not been decided, and the implementation has not been sufficiently prepared. Therefore, in the very short term, it is expected that there will be no direct military action to seize Eastern Suiyuan. Most of those who intruded into Eastern Suiyuan this time were bandits and puppet troops. The bandits were from Wang Daoyi's gang and scattered bandits newly recruited from Hebei Province. The puppet troops were from Li Shouxin's rebel troops and the security forces of Zhuosh Hai's unit in Inner Mongolia. Although the number reached 10,000, they were mostly a motley crowd. After being defeated in this intrusion, they are now reorganizing. The troops that a certain party recently sent to Zhangbei totaled two regiments, which together with the Chinese army, amounted to about two regiments. Their purpose is to supervise the battle, and their nature is like that of a supervising team. With this small number of troops, it is unlikely that they will dare to attack. Moreover, there are not many troops in Rehe Province other than the militia. From this, it can be seen that a certain party is still mainly instigating bandits to intrude. If they achieve their goal, they can sit back and enjoy the success; otherwise, they may temporarily adopt a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>De Wang himself is in a very difficult situation. He is still in Jiabu Temple. The rumor that he has gone to Bailing Temple to handle the closing of the Mongolian Political Council is not true, and it is also impossible. De Wang once told a certain party, "You can do whatever you want; I don't want to advocate anything." From this, we can see De Wang's intention. Li Shouxin, who is now in Shangdu, also said, "I once commanded the Volunteer Army. What was the task I was responsible for at that time? How can I be willing to be a traitor now? I personally am not a problem, but I must plan for the resettlement of my subordinates. Therefore, the current situation has arisen. In the future, I will definitely seek a way to ensure both aspects and protect my past reputation."</p>
<p>The Suiyuan authorities foresaw the bandit's invasion four months ago. At that time, Pu Province was carrying out a large-scale purge of the remaining communists in the territory. Chairman Fu Zuoyi of Suiyuan was also in Shanxi. Regarding this matter, Fu had discussed everything with Yan Xishan and decided to do his utmost to preserve the territory. After Mr. Fu returned to Suiyuan, he began to make arrangements. The fortifications along the Ping-Sui line have now been completed. Mr. Fu's current tour is to inspect everything. (12th)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Assassination Case in Zhangzhou: Weng Cixing Assassinated After Reforming; Seventeen Bullets Hit, Died on the Spot; Two Assassins Both Escaped <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: An assassination case occurred in Zhangzhou at 8:15 p.m. on the 9th, creating a tense situation. The deceased was Weng Cixing, the former commander of the pseudo "Fujian Fourth Detachment of the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance Army," who had reformed not long ago. The two assassins both escaped. According to investigations, Weng was a well-known local communist in Zhangzhou and Xiamen during the era when Zhang Zhen, the commander of the 49th Division, was stationed in Zhangzhou before the 20th year of the Republic. During the Fujian Incident, he served as a leading figure in the pseudo People's Government Farmers' Association. After the Fujian Incident was quelled, Weng fled to Hong Kong and Shanghai, and later joined Chen Mingshu's pseudo "Chinese National Revolutionary Datong Alliance." Chen appointed him to secretly organize the "Heng Society" in Xiamen and Gulangyu, recruiting bandits and hooligans, and also served as the commander of the pseudo Alliance Army. In the early summer of this year, he was arrested in Xiamen and sent to the Zhangzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office. Later, he was allowed to reform. Weng issued a declaration, exposing Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen's conspiracy to form a pseudo alliance. After reforming, he served as an intelligence officer in the Commissioner's Office. On the evening of the 9th, at around 8 p.m., Weng left his home at No. 24 Luan'an South Road, and someone immediately followed him. When he reached the front of No. 7 Luan'an West Road, an assassin shot Weng with a Mauser pistol from a distance of three or four steps behind. Weng was hit by two bullets and fell to the ground. The assassin then repeatedly shot Weng's chest and abdomen more than ten times. Another assassin caught up and fired several shots with a Browning pistol. The gunshots were like a string of firecrackers. Stray bullets slightly injured two passers-by. The scene was the bustling central market of Zhangzhou. Pedestrians were numerous, and they were shocked and fled when they heard the incident. Merchants did not know what had happened and closed their doors. Before long, the effect spread to the entire city. The assassins escaped in the confusion. When the military police rushed to the scene, Weng was barely breathing and soon died. His right hand was still gripping the handle of the Browning pistol he was carrying at his left waist, as if he wanted to draw his gun to resist but was unable to do so. An examination of his body revealed that he had been hit by a total of seventeen bullets, and his entire body was covered in blood. The city defense command immediately announced martial law, surrounded and searched the vicinity, but found nothing. At around 1 a.m., martial law was further tightened, and household registrations were checked. The investigation was completed at 4 or 5 a.m. on the 10th. Sentries were posted on all major roads in the southeast, northwest, and northeast suburbs to prevent the assassins from escaping. After dawn, the sentries saw a suspicious person inside the West Gate Lake, ordered him to stop, and the person immediately pulled out a Mauser pistol to resist and was shot dead on the spot. It was found that he was Ma Hao, a member of Gao Weinan's bandit gang who had already been sentenced. Nothing else was found. That night, the city defense department banned the publication of news. The ban was lifted the next day. The reason for Weng's assassination is unclear. (August 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e68">Ancient Trees in Southern Anhui Abusively Felled by Mountain People; Jing-Qu Railway Plans to Purchase Sleepers Locally at a Given Price; Mountain People, Thinking They Would Be Requisitioned Without Payment, Destroyed the Trees in Advance <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: Ninguo, Jingxian, Jingde, Langxi, and Guangde counties in southern Anhui are mostly mountainous and rich in natural forests. A large amount of pine timber and charcoal is exported every year. Among them, chestnut and elm are all useful materials. The Anhui Provincial Government, in line with the purpose of promoting forestry, specifically consulted with the Ministry of Railways and planned to use chestnut and elm produced in the above counties for sleeper materials for the Jing-Qu Railway, which is under construction and passes through Anhui Province. The selling price is not only cheaper than imported products, but there is also no transportation hassle. The Ministry of Railways agreed to this. After both parties finalized the agreement, the Anhui Construction Bureau summoned timber merchants from the above-mentioned areas to Wuhu for talks, and agreed on a number of payment and contract methods. Unexpectedly, most mountain owners, for some reason, developed a huge misunderstanding, fearing that timber merchants would arbitrarily requisition timber in the future without paying a price. They abused and felled ancient trees that had been growing for many years, causing a large number of useful and good materials to be destroyed and turned into firewood. Timber merchants Chen Daofu and Shi Zhenqi, etc., were greatly alarmed by this news. The earthworks for the railway have already started, and the track is being laid in sections, and the time is near. Not only will this delay the railway work, but the provincial government's credibility with the Ministry of Railways is also greatly affected. Timber merchants contract for work with fair prices, and it is not using government officials to arbitrarily requisition. It is really no different than commercial trade. If not promptly and strictly stopped, the damage is unimaginable. A joint petition was submitted to the Xuancheng Ninth Administrative District Commissioner's Office to investigate and prohibit the indiscriminate felling of ancient trees by mountain owners. After receiving the petition, the Commissioner's Office immediately sent a telegram to various places, ordering them to persuade and admonish the mountain owners. (12th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Kunshan: County Court Site Determined <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Judicial Administration previously informed the Jiangsu Provincial Government that courts should be established uniformly in all counties within three years. Later, the Provincial Government believed that this plan had many obstacles and that its economic strength was insufficient, so it specifically informed the Ministry that it planned to establish courts in the province separately within six years. The Ministry then replied in agreement and established the courts in phases. It is now learned that after receiving the order, the County Government is actively preparing. County Magistrate Peng and Trial Officer Cao also surveyed a Wang family house on Xitang Street in the city to be the site of the County Court and reported it to the High Court for filing. Yang Yuande, a resident of Pingting Town in the Second District of the county, is over fifty years old, but suffers from a mental illness. He often goes out and causes trouble. Although he has been treated once, it has not been eradicated. Recently, Yang's old illness relapsed. At about 4 p.m. on the 12th, he suddenly broke into the Second District Office of the town and caused trouble. When the town officials saw this, they immediately ordered the yamen runner to tell his mother, Yang Hu, to come and dissuade him. Not only did he refuse to listen, but he took scissors and chased and beat his mother, causing deep wounds to Mrs. Hu's neck and chest and abdomen. Her ribs were broken, and she fell to the ground and died on the spot. When the townspeople saw that Yang had caused a major disaster, they immediately reported it to the competent public security substation. Inspector Zhang ordered Chief Policeman Hu Bin and Special Police Zhang Mingtang to carry live ammunition rifles and rush to the scene to suppress him. When Yang saw that the police had arrived, he resisted and attempted to commit violence. Special Officer Wang Mingtang immediately raised his gun and fired at Yang Yuande, hitting him in the buttocks. He collapsed due to excessive blood loss and died before he could be treated. The substation immediately sent a telegram to the County Government, which dispatched Trial Officer Cao to lead officials to the scene to inspect the body and provide coffins. Special Police Officer Wang Mingtang was sent to the County Government for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Guangdong Province's Issue of Changing to the Silver Dollar System; The Exchange Rate Between Silver Dollars and Small Silver Coins is Under Discussion; Business Community Believes the Exchange Rate Should Not Exceed Three <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The Guangdong Provincial Government is actively preparing for the implementation of the silver dollar system. Finance Director Song Ziliang and Ju Zuyi took a plane from Guangdong to Lushan on the 11th specifically for the reform, to ask Minister Kong for instructions on everything. In the future, there will be no problem with the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank issuing silver dollar notes in Guangdong. However, the standard for the exchange rate between the silver dollar and Guangdong silver certificates has not yet been determined, and experts have been enthusiastically discussing this point in recent days. Some advocate adding 1.44 to the silver certificate exchange rate with silver dollars, that is, every 100 yuan of silver dollars exchanges for 144 yuan of Guangdong silver certificates. Some advocate adding 1.25, that is, 100 yuan of silver dollars exchanges for 125 yuan of Guangdong silver certificates. The arguments are diverse, each with its own reasons. Therefore, the Finance Authorities have not yet stipulated the exchange rate between silver dollars and silver certificates. Recently, the Guangdong business community has also proposed opinions on setting the exchange rate. According to the Silver Industry Association, the ratio of silver dollars to silver certificates should be no more than three, because in the past, the collection of national taxes in Guangdong Province was paid with silver certificates plus 25% for water. If calculated with a ratio of three, the difference is minimal. If the difference in the exchange rate is too large (some advocate adding six), Guangdong people will bear heavy taxes and prices will increase accordingly. Therefore, it is advocated that the rate should not be too disparate, so as not to hinder the implementation of the currency unification. As for the Guangzhou General Chamber of Commerce, it also listed its opinions on the exchange rate between silver dollars and Guangdong certificates yesterday and telegraphed Minister Kong to approve the implementation. The telegraph stated as follows: "The reason for Guangdong Province's conversion to the silver dollar system is to seek currency unification. However, this matter is closely related to the interests of the people of Guangdong. Our association has collected the opinions of many merchants. The highest rate for exchanging small silver coins for silver dollars cannot exceed three. The reasons are as follows: (1) The exchange rate for changing to silver dollars should be based on the reserve fund, but the government is still continuing to purchase silver, so the amount of the reserve fund cannot be precisely calculated. As far as the current situation is concerned, in addition to the 100 million yuan of silver already collected, the assets of other provincial and municipal banks and the value of the construction of sugar factories, yarn factories, and earthworks, together with public bonds and borrowings, are estimated to be more than 200 million yuan. In the future, when more silver is collected, Guangdong Province's reserve fund will be even greater. (2) Guangdong Province's small silver certificates have always been exchanged for silver at current rates. Although there was a move to purchase silver at a rate of two last year, the people did not actually benefit from it. All of the silver owned by the people of Guangdong is deposited and transacted at the silver certificate number and exchanged back to legal currency, which is more than several times the number purchased by the government. It can be seen that the general public has not benefited from the two-for-one exchange. (3) For more than 20 years, the highest amount of silver dollars received in national taxes in Guangdong Province has been calculated at a rate of three over silver certificates, that is, the ordinary market price is also between two and three. The abnormal mutation cannot be used as a basis for argument. Furthermore, the merchants and people of Guangdong Province have raised huge amounts of money to help the revolutionary army over the years and have made huge sacrifices. Now that the overall situation is the same and the currency system has changed, the people of Guangdong are afraid that the silver dollar ratio will be set too high, and they are all at a loss. We respectfully telegraph to your office for review and approval, requesting that the Guangdong Finance Office order that the highest silver dollar ratio for small silver coins must not exceed three, in order to appease public opinion, and request a telegraphic instruction to comply. Sincerely, Guangzhou General Chamber of Commerce." (August 11th)</p>

<p>Wang Cainan (Zhengrong), the former director of the teller department of the Suzhou Farmers Bank, absconded with 150,000 yuan last year. Although the matter has been reported to the authorities for investigation, there has been no news to this day. Liu Zhaoxiang, the president of the bank, suspected that Shi Zongding, the teller department staff member who had been dismissed from the bank, was complicit in the matter and filed a complaint with the local court, accusing Shi Zongding of embezzlement. The local court held a hearing on the morning of the 10th. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were summoned to the court and questioned by Judge Fang Qinghuan. Shi Zongding was ordered to pay a written bail of 1,000 yuan and released, pending investigation and further interrogation.</p>

<p>The death of Yang Daohong's second son, You, from Zhangyan, in his Shanghai residence was reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Yang's residence received a total of more than 300 condolence couplets and eulogies. Pei Fuheng, Chen Jicheng, Mu Ouchu, Li Youzhi, Tai Shuangqiu, Lei Guoneng, Chen Duanzhi, Xu Renhan, Yu Zhicheng, and others from Shanghai all sent gifts. Xuan You, Lu Jitang, Yao Shizi, Yao Zhixuan, Wang Ruowang, Zhang Zhongtian, Bai Jiao, and others from the local area also personally went to offer condolences. In addition, Yan Youren and Xu Zuqi, representatives of the Private Shanghai Middle School, and Cai Zhizuo and Zhang Fushou, representatives of the National Shanghai College of Commerce, went to pay their respects. There were hundreds of male and female guests.

<h3 id="e78">Water District Gun Loss Case Cracked <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Nine box-type guns, four handguns, and 2,700 bullets were stolen while Shen Jinghua was the former district chief of the Fourth District of the Guazhou Water Police. For many days, the stolen items were not recovered. Recently, Zhu Xinke, the head of the district's detective team, was instructed to strictly investigate the case. He obtained information from informants and captured Sun Desheng and a Mr. Fan outside the South Gate of Zhenjiang, recovering a handgun and 50 bullets. Fan confessed that he currently works as a clerk in the First Branch Bureau of the provincial capital. The stolen guns and bullets from the district office were entirely the work of Cao Jinyuan, a sergeant in the former district office's special task force, who entrusted Li Xingsheng, who was stationed in the countryside outside the South Gate, to sell them. Based on the confession, Captain Zhu led detectives such as Miao Tongfu and arrested Li in Mingguang County, Anhui. They continued to search the home of Liu Zhaolin in Jiulipu, Second District of Jiangdu, recovering 1,318 bullets. Liu was a cook in the former district office. Liu was taken back for questioning. It was later learned that Cao Jinyuan, the prime suspect in the case, had fled and was hiding in Daluzhen Town outside Zhenjiang City. He was reported to the security team and tax police for carrying a handgun in the bathhouse. When the tax police arrived to arrest him, Cao opened fire and was killed on the spot. Only one accomplice, Chen Yongde, a box-type gun and dozens of bullets were captured. He has been taken back by the tax police for questioning. Captain Zhu, after hearing the news, has sent a letter to the tax police team to bring Chen and the guns and bullets back for further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e85">City Party Headquarters Issues Notice to Citizens for Citizen Registration and Oath-taking Yesterday <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The National News Agency reported that the City Party Headquarters issued a notice to citizens yesterday regarding citizen registration and citizen oath-taking. The original text is as follows: "Dear compatriots, the National Assembly will be held on November 12th of this year. This is an excellent opportunity for us to participate in national politics. However, to participate in national politics and exercise our rights to elect, recall, initiate, and referendum, we must first obtain citizenship. How can we obtain citizenship? Simply put, anyone over the age of twenty, regardless of gender, who has not committed a crime or has a mental illness can register with the citizen registration office. After completing the citizen oath-taking procedure, they obtain citizenship and have citizen rights. Citizen registration and citizen oath-taking have now begun in this city. We hope that the general public will understand the following points: First, the significance of holding this citizen registration and citizen oath-taking is profound. Those who register and take the oath obtain citizenship and become good citizens who accept the Three Principles of the People, and they can participate in the election of this year's National Assembly. Therefore, it can also be said that this is a prerequisite for the people to participate in national politics. Second, promoting local autonomy is the foundation for realizing the principle of people's rights. If local autonomy is successfully promoted, the people will be able to manage local affairs, and then they will be able to participate in national affairs, develop true people's rights, and permanently establish the foundation of the Republic of China. To achieve this goal, everyone must fulfill citizen registration and citizen oath-taking. At the same time, we hope that everyone will actively fulfill citizen registration and citizen oath-taking. (Slogans) Fulfilling citizen registration and citizen oath-taking is the only way to obtain citizenship; With citizenship, the people have the right to participate in politics; Giving up citizenship is not a virtue of the people; Respecting citizenship is respecting one's own personality; Quickly and actively fulfill citizen registration and citizen oath-taking."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, stating, "Respectful report to the Honorable Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, regarding the domestic artificial silk woven products sold by silk merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, which are purchased in small quantities from local weaving households, assembled into whole units, and then sold in batches to merchants from various provinces. The weaving households purchase silk in small quantities from local firms, and the original artificial silk importers have already resold it six, seven, or even ten times. There is no way to obtain tax receipts or exchange them for licenses. Representatives of the industry, such as Luo Qinghua, have already explained this in detail to Section Chief Wu of your administration during their petition, and we believe they were understood. We request that the articles of the inspection and clearance of artificial silk piece goods be revised. Before the regulations are revised, we request a temporary suspension of implementation. Otherwise, starting tomorrow, silk woven products from various provinces will be unable to be transported and sold, and weaving households and silk merchants will be unable to make a living. We beg for a speedy review and response by telegram. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits."</p>

<h3 id="e88">Silver Import Surplus <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The government's purpose in reforming the currency system is to: Unify issuance, Centralize reserves, Preserve silver, Revitalize industry. Its aim is to prevent our country's currency from being affected by the fluctuations of the world bank and to achieve independence in order to promote the revival of the national economy. Since the implementation of the new monetary policy, foreign exchange has remained stable, and silver exports were highest in December of last year, with an export surplus of 66,608 yuan. However, by January of this year, the export surplus decreased to 15,416,432 yuan. Since then, it has changed to an import surplus. For example, in April, the import surplus was 92,349 yuan, which is a very small amount, but it can be said that the government's purpose of preserving silver has been fully achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Bank Deposits in This City Exceed 600 Million Yuan <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The East China News Agency reported that the deposits in more than 40 banks in this city for the first half of this year, according to the finalized accounts published, amount to 21, with no reports from the rest. In total, the more than 40 banks have more than 600 million yuan in current and fixed deposits. According to the Savings Bank Law, 120 million yuan of this amount must be lent to rural areas. However, due to current circumstances, the amount of loans to rural areas in the city is only 20 to 30 million yuan, which is far from the regulation. Now that the Rural Development Bureau is about to be established, the stagnant funds in the banking sector have slightly improved, but the proportion is only 1% of the deposits. Therefore, economic circles hope that the government and the financial sector will cooperate and stipulate that a few more percentage points be set aside for industrial loans. If necessary, a "Industrial Capital Bureau" similar to the Rural Bureau should be established to jointly invest.</p>

He departed last night. The China Seafarers' Party, due to its responsibilities, has also sent Hu Qi, the director of the worker training department, to Beijing to forward everything to the Central Government.

However, the China Salt Administration Discussion Meeting believes that there are many misunderstandings about the new salt law in the Qi telegram issued by the Association, and there is a lack of understanding of the salt administration's malpractices. Therefore, it sent a letter to the Association explaining in detail. The following is an excerpt from the original letter: (Omitted above) The new salt law only has regulations for the denaturation and discoloration of salt used for industrial and agricultural purposes that are completely tax-exempt. It does not state that fishing salt should also be denatured and discolored. It is deeply aware of the fishermen's pain and should not impose harsh restrictions. Furthermore, salted fish is a food for people, and if it is made with denatured and discolored salt, it will not be welcomed by buyers. We can try to examine the imported foreign salted fish to know that fishing salt should not be denatured and discolored. As for the complicated procedures for weighing, releasing, and obtaining licenses, they are all the malpractices of the current salt officials. Their only purpose is to increase tax revenue, and they know nothing about protecting the livelihood of fishermen and competing in the international fishing industry. The state spends tens of millions of yuan to feed these ignorant salt officials, who only know how to kill and suck blood to please their superiors, which is regrettable. If the new salt law is not implemented one day, the Chinese people will not be able to live and work in peace, and Chinese society will not be able to be stable. This association has a special article on the Dai Shan tragedy and the fishing salt issue, which will be published soon. Your association is a powerful people's organization in the country, and the leaders are also outstanding people of the time. In the future, we hope that you will unanimously support the new salt law and promote its early realization to relieve the suffering of the people of the country, which is not only for the welfare of your hometown.</p>

<p>Mr. Kawagoe, the Japanese Ambassador to China, along with Secretary Ogihara, Secretary Hoshida, and others, departed from Shanghai on the Japanese vessel Dalian Maru at 11:00 AM on the 13th, heading to Qingdao and then on to the Beiping and Tianjin areas to inspect overseas Chinese affairs. Ambassador Kawagoe and his party left the ambassador's residence on Bixun Road at approximately 10:00 AM to board the ship at the Huangpu Wharf. Zhou Jue, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang Changchun, Commissioner of the Municipal Government, Kita, the Japanese Embassy's Military Attaché, Sato, the Naval Attaché, Suma, Arino, and over a hundred representatives of Japanese residents all came to the wharf to see them off. After arriving in Qingdao, Ambassador Kawagoe will not stay long but will proceed to the Beiping and Tianjin areas to inspect the country's overseas Chinese affairs and handle matters at the Beiping embassy. He will also meet with Tashiro, the commander of the Japanese garrison in North China. According to Arino, the Japanese Embassy's Counselor, who spoke to a reporter from the Central News Agency on board the ship, Ambassador Kawagoe's trip has no special mission. Since the ambassador took office, he has not been to Beiping to handle embassy affairs, so he will return to Shanghai after this trip around North China and then plan another trip to Nanjing at a later date. After arriving in Tianjin, the ambassador will meet with consuls-general stationed in various parts of North China, but there has been no mention of a conference being convened. Regarding the issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in North China, this trip by the ambassador is certainly related, but how to begin is still under study. After arriving in Beiping, he will meet with Song Zheyuan, and on his return trip south, he plans to pass through Jinan to visit Han Fuju, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Danyang Silk and Satin Industry Requests Establishment of a Danyang Group Based on Precedent <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The Silk and Satin Industry Guild will hold a meeting to discuss the inclusion of the Danyang silk industry. The industry has a long history, and the number of firms establishing branches in Shanghai is about twelve. These have already joined the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Guild as members. However, the Silk and Satin Guild has never had a Danyang group, which has caused difficulties. Recently, due to rampant smuggling, the silk industry has been handling inventory registration and five-level procedures for transportation and sales. The Danyang silk industry, lacking affiliation, has found this especially difficult. Therefore, the twelve silk firms in the industry have jointly sent a letter to the Silk and Satin Industry Guild, requesting the establishment of a Danyang group, following the precedents of the Hangzhou Silk Group and others, to clarify the system and strengthen anti-smuggling efforts. The chairman of the Danyang County Chamber of Commerce and the chairman of the Danyang Silk Firms Industry Guild have also sent telegrams to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Silk and Satin Industry Guild, requesting special assistance. The Silk and Satin Industry Guild, after receiving the letter, will hold a meeting to discuss the matter. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Letter Requesting Establishment of Danyang Group</p>
<p>The Danyang silk industry firms in Shanghai sent a letter to the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Guild, stating: "To whom it may concern, Our Danyang silk industry has a long history and a renowned reputation both domestically and abroad. To facilitate business operations, we have always established branches in Shanghai, hoping to expand our business. Unexpectedly, times have changed, and smuggled goods are rampant. Therefore, we have sought to closely organize ourselves, hoping to remedy the situation to some extent. All our fellow traders are pained by the entire economic crisis and unanimously volunteered to join your guild, hoping to standardize our procedures and unite as one. After joining, we were grateful to be assigned to the Shengjing Group by your guild. All our fellow traders have complied with your guild's instructions, filled out guarantees and other documents according to the regulations, and joined the Shengjing Group. However, unexpectedly, we were rejected, leaving all our fellow traders at a loss, not knowing what to do. However, after reviewing our past, our history is quite long, and we have always been independent, clearly distinct from the Hangzhou Silk Group, the Suzhou Satin Group, and the Shengjing Group, each being unrelated to the others. If we are forced to join the Shengjing Group, not only would we be incompatible, but in fact, there would be many obstacles in the future. To avoid future disputes, we hereby invoke the precedents of your guild's Hangzhou Silk Group, Suzhou Satin Group, and others. All our fellow traders have unanimously resolved to establish a Danyang Group to clarify the system, hoping to pool our efforts to strictly combat smuggling and achieve our initial goal. For this reason, we submit the above-mentioned reasons and facts, hoping for your approval and guidance in all matters. Furthermore, before the formal establishment of the Danyang Group, we would like to know where we should have our inventories of goods registered and certified by each of our firms. We would be most grateful for your reply. Sincerely, the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Guild Standing Committee, from all Danyang traders, Lun Chang Shen Jin Ji, Da Lun Chang, Jin Yu Heng, Da Yuan Yong Kang Ming Yuan Yi Tian Lun Ming Xing Mei Lun Tian Lai Jiu Da Yu, etc."</p>
<p>Telegram to the Chamber of Commerce Requesting Assistance</p>
<p>To Wang, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Our guild members, the silk firm industry guild representatives, claim that our fellow traders have always dealt in domestic silk crepe and also engage in the artificial silk textile business. There are twelve firms, including Da Lun Chang, etc., who have joined the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Guild as members. We have recently telegraphed the guild, requesting that the goods stored in Shanghai branches be allowed to be reported to the Customs for registration. We now telegraph again to request your special assistance to facilitate this and forward this information to the Silk and Satin Industry Guild for implementation. We eagerly await your response. Guo Songru, Chairman of the Danyang County Chamber of Commerce, respectfully.</p>

<p>To the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Guild, our fellow traders have always dealt in domestic silk crepe and also engage in the artificial silk textile business. There are twelve firms, including Da Lun Chang, etc., who have joined your guild as members.

<h3 id="e102">Eurasia Aviation Corporation to Offer Passenger Insurance <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>It is reported that Eurasia Aviation Corporation, in view of its five years of operation and the fact that its main routes are all in the northwest and southwest regions, areas of high mountains and deep valleys inaccessible to ships and trains, coupled with the company's use of well-manufactured and safe aircraft and its experienced and cautious pilots, has, in the five years since its founding, occasionally been forced to land due to adverse weather conditions, but without passenger injuries or fatalities, thus gaining the trust of the public, and the number of passengers has gradually increased. However, compared with the number of air passengers in Europe and the United States, the difference is still too great. It is now learned that the company, in order to further strengthen public confidence and promote the development of the aviation industry, has recently planned to offer compulsory passenger insurance, with the amount insured temporarily set at 10,000 yuan per person, and the insurance premiums will be borne by the company and will not be added to the ticket prices. Negotiations are currently underway with various domestic and foreign insurance companies, and if progress is smooth, it could be implemented next month. Once this is accomplished, it can be concluded that the number of air passengers will definitely increase by leaps and bounds, and not only will the company's business prospects be bright, but the future of the national aviation industry will also be full of infinite hope.</p>

<h3 id="e104">First Special Court to Convene Tomorrow Creditors' Meeting for Tongyi to Elect Supervisors to Oversee Bankruptcy Proceedings <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Tongyi Trust Company has been closed for nearly three months. Chairman Huang Suchu has avoided appearing, and despite repeated mediation by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, there has been no practical solution. Concerned about their legal interests, creditors have successively engaged lawyers Zhang Shizhao, Zhang Yifan, Chen Changteng, and accountant Ma Qichang to file lawsuits. After multiple court hearings, a verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 18th. The First Special District Court has also approved the request of some creditors for a ruling to execute bankruptcy and will convene the first creditors' meeting tomorrow morning. In order to understand the truth, the reporter visited the Jianping Law and Accounting Firm to inquire with Lawyer Zhang, but as Zhang was out of town, accountant Ma and Lawyer Zhang Yifan received the reporter. Accountant Ma gave the following answers:</p>
<p>Reasons for Failure</p>
<p>The reporter first inquired about the reasons for the failure of Tongyi Company. It was said that although the company had a long history, it had been empty in recent years. The reasons for its failure are roughly as follows: (1) According to my statistics, the interest rate on fixed deposits in the company was generally between 9.1% and as high as 1.2%, while the loans it issued were only 1.2%. In comparison, there was not only no profit to be made, but even expenses became a problem. (2) The company's loans of 978,000 yuan to the Tongcheng Yarn Factory in Changzhou and the 300,000 yuan borrowed from the Ministry of Finance of the former Beijing government had long become bad debts, but the company still listed them as full assets. Moreover, there was no depreciation item for the company's movable assets. Therefore, although there were profits on the books in earlier years, the actual losses were considerable. (3) As mentioned above, the internal emptiness is self-evident, and the repeated issuance of dividends and bonuses over the years was all drawn from the capital account in an attempt to prolong its life. The amount withdrawn from the principal over the years reached 100,000. This policy was tantamount to accelerating its demise, so it ultimately suffered a complete and irreversible defeat.</p>
<p>Responsibilities of Directors and Supervisors</p>
<p>Regarding the question of whether creditors' deposits can be fully recovered after the company is declared bankrupt and the responsibilities of the company's directors and supervisors, it was said that regarding savings deposits, according to Article 15 of the Savings Bank Law, directors and supervisors shall bear joint and several liability for repayment, and the Ministry of Finance also has an approval, so there is no problem. Even ordinary depositors must bear joint and several liability. Although there is the title of managing director in company law, there is no provision for ordinary directors in law. According to precedent, even if directors divide their powers and manage their affairs separately, they are ultimately a single entity externally. Therefore, the directors and supervisors of the company cannot disclaim responsibility by claiming that they were not involved. Moreover, the company's collapse this time violated the provisions of Articles 231 to 233 of the Company Law's penalty clauses and should be liable for compensation to creditors in accordance with regulations. The creditors' meeting to be convened by the First Special Court on the 15th is to elect one or more supervisors to oversee the bankruptcy proceedings and effectively protect the legal interests of creditors.</p>

<p>Change to Re-Register with the Nearest Customs Office The Ministries of Finance and Communications previously stipulated in Article 5 of the Regulations on Customs Management of Maritime Civilian Ships and Shipping that "All registered maritime civilian ships shall be re-registered with the original registering customs office in January of each year." For civilian ships, only re-registration with the original registering customs office was allowed, and other customs offices were not allowed to handle registration procedures, which was indeed difficult. Therefore, suggestions were drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan to change the phrase "re-register with the original registering customs office" to "re-register with the nearest customs office or customs post." After receiving the submission, the Executive Yuan has recently approved its implementation.</p>

<p>The Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs stated that in accordance with the Provisional Measures for Inspecting Imported Goods, 26 kinds of foreign goods, such as rayon, and similar genuine domestic goods, require transportation and sales licenses for transportation, which is a very heavy task. Therefore, a special office for transportation and sales licenses has been established in the customs to exclusively manage the issuance of transportation and sales licenses. Merchants applying for the aforementioned licenses can contact the office.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Municipal Fishery Association Requests Clarification of National Representative Quota <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Fishery Association stated that with the election of National Representatives approaching, according to the provisions of Appendix 3 of the Election Law, the Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association and Fishery Association together have four representatives. However, the number of representatives specifically for the Fishery Association has not yet been determined. Yesterday, they specifically submitted a request to the Shanghai Election Office of the National Assembly for clarification. The original request is transcribed as follows: Request for clarification of the number of representatives from the Municipal Fishery Association and the method of selecting candidates for Fishery Association representatives in order to emphasize electoral affairs. It is noted that for this National Assembly, the Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association and Fishery Association have a total of four representatives. Shanghai is the hub for the collection and distribution of fisheries nationwide and the only base for modern fisheries in the country. Although the number of Fishery Association members is not as large as that of the Farmers' Association, its position is no less important than that of the Farmers' Association. The number of representatives should be equally divided. However, there is no explicit provision on how many representatives each Farmers' Association and Fishery Association should have. This is the first point to be clarified. Furthermore, the Farmers' Association and Fishery Association are two professional organizations with different natures, conflicting interests, and equal status, not subordinate to each other. According to Article 20 of the National Assembly Election Law, the Farmers' Association and Fishery Association should each select candidates separately through the executive organs of the two organizations, rather than through a mixed selection. However, it has not been revealed which method will be used, leaving us at a loss. This is the second point to be clarified. The above two points are crucial to the timing of the election, and therefore we submit this document for your review and prompt instruction.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, in order to improve the production and manufacturing of tung oil and promote the development of foreign trade, the Ministry of Industry is organizing the establishment of a vegetable oil plant. The participating provinces include Zhejiang, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, and Guangxi. The authorized capital is 2 million yuan, with the Ministry of Industry responsible for 500,000 yuan, and the remaining 1.5 million yuan to be borne equally by the five provinces, with each contributing 300,000 yuan. A preparatory office was established, and Zhang Jiazhu and others were assigned to be responsible for carrying out the work. The office first dispatched experts such as Lin Tianji to visit various provinces to investigate opinions from all parties, the trends in the oil industry, and technical improvements. They have successively returned to Shanghai and drafted reports. It is reported that most of the capital to be paid by the provinces has been remitted. Zhang then took the report and went to Nanjing a few days ago and proceeded to Guling to attend the inaugural meeting to be held on the 15th. At that time, directors, supervisors, and general managers will be elected to actively proceed with the plant construction. It is reported that the main plant will be specially set up in Hankou, and several branch plants will be established in various provinces.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Case of President Wang and Others Transferred for Disciplinary Action: Xu Yongzuo's Statement: Public Announcement Within Three Days After Ruling, Stating No Violation or Disobedience <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Control Yuan, based on the complaint from the Shanghai Branch of Xiamen Commercial Bank, accusing Wang Simao, President of the Shanghai Second Special District Court, and Judge Tu Shenjie of illegally protecting the Funing Shipping Company liquidation case, and the impeachment document from the Jiangsu Supervisory Envoy, the review report of the supervisory committee, and the transfer document for disciplinary action from the Control Yuan, have all been published in previous reports. The liquidator appointed by the court in the liquidation case is accountant Xu Yongzuo. Accountant Xu, due to statements in the impeachment and review reports that the liquidator did not publish the announcement in the newspaper until three months after the statutory period, which may have caused losses to creditors, specifically submitted a letter to the court yesterday explaining everything. Here is the letter he sent to the court:</p>
<p>"Today, I read in the newspaper that Xiamen Bank has filed a complaint with the Control Yuan against President Wang and Judge Tu of the Second Special Court for illegally protecting the liquidation of the Funing Shipping Company. After investigation by the Jiangsu Supervisory Envoy, an impeachment was proposed. The main points of the impeachment are: firstly, delaying the revocation of the detention of ships; secondly, the appointed liquidator did not publish the announcement in the newspaper until three months after the statutory period, which may have caused losses to creditors and failure to fulfill supervisory responsibilities. Except for the first point, which is not related to Yongzuo, the second point is quite impossible to ignore in terms of facts and laws.</p>
<p>In terms of facts, Yongzuo was appointed as the liquidator in this case by a ruling on August 10, 1935. However, Yongzuo received the appointment notice on August 21st and took office on August 22nd. On that day, he immediately sent a letter to the former liquidator, Lawyer Sun Zhongyao, requesting a handover. The next day, he received a reply stating that the company's assets had already been transferred to the creditor representative, Xiamen Bank, etc., and that an objection had been filed against the Second Special Court's ruling on August 10th in accordance with the law. Therefore, on August 24th, he reported the situation to your court for instructions on whether to continue to execute the original ruling. If the original ruling was to be executed, how should the assets be retrieved? Before receiving approval, it was naturally impossible to proceed.</p>
<p>On November 16th, the lawyer representing the company's shareholders, Chen Yongyuan, etc., Su Fuchou, sent a letter with the second ruling on the 13th of the same month, still removing Sun Zhongyao from his position as liquidator and appointing Yongzuo as the liquidator. Therefore, on the 17th, a public announcement was drafted and sent to various newspapers for publication on the 18th. It seems to have been extremely prompt to issue the announcement within three days of receiving the second ruling. Even if calculated from the date of receiving the first ruling, it did not exceed three months. Moreover, the reason for the temporary postponement of the announcement was that the former liquidator filed an appeal and refused to hand over the assets, so it was necessary to wait for instructions on how to handle the matter. How can this be called a delay?</p>
<p>In terms of law, the current Company Law Article 214 applies the provisions of Article 62, which states that after the liquidator is appointed, he should use public announcement to urge creditors to report their claims, etc. There is no time limit of several months. The impeachment document states that it exceeded the statutory period of three months. The so-called statutory period is unknown.</p>
<p>In summary, Yongzuo, in handling this case, did not delay in fact, and did not violate the law. Even your court is not suspected of failing to fulfill its supervisory duties. However, since the original texts of the impeachment review, etc., have been disclosed in detail in the newspapers, it is inevitable that the audience will feel that your court has indeed been negligent in supervision, and that Yongzuo has indeed been negligent in his duties, which is regrettable. Yongzuo has always handled cases with a deep sense of self-respect and would never dare to neglect his duties or accept any protection, seeking to avoid all criticism. Now he is associated with your court, so he has to explain everything in detail in the hope that it will be investigated."</p>

<p>The Ministry of Railways instructed all national railway bureaus:</p>
<p>"According to the China Alcohol Manufacturing Co., Ltd.'s request to reduce alcohol freight rates to promote and expand sales, the Ministry has determined that alcohol is a major raw material in the chemical industry. At a time when the promotion of domestically produced chemical industrial products is encouraged, it is necessary to provide assistance. A special price for domestically produced alcohol is now set, reducing the fee by 10% based on the original grade of the alcohol. This is publicly applicable and will be implemented from August 20th of this year for a period of one year. In addition to the instructions, the order is hereby issued for compliance. This order."</p>
<h3 id="e113">Cantonese Gang: Guangxing Bank Suspended Operations Yesterday; Affected by Market Decline and Shanghai-Guangdong Exchange Rates; Liabilities of Several Tens of Thousands of Dollars; Liquidation Has Begun <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Guangxing Bank, a Cantonese gang bank located at 553 Sichuan Road, whose main business was Shanghai-Guangdong exchange, and also engaged in money exchange business, ceased operations yesterday. A notice stating "Clearing accounts, temporarily suspending business" was posted at the entrance. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the money exchange industry yesterday that the bank had a capital of approximately 20,000 yuan and had been in operation for two years. It has been affected by the sluggish market, coupled with the sharp drop in Shanghai-Guangdong exchange rates, resulting in inflexible turnover and forced closure. It is currently being liquidated independently, and the total debt is said to be approximately 20,000 yuan, which is unrelated to the overall financial situation.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Telephone Problem Committee Criticizes Telephone Company: Inaccurate Counting; Requested Correction Based on Report <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Special District Telephone Problem Committee of this city sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession yesterday, stating:</p>
<p>"Respectfully, according to a letter from Jiang Xinzhao of the Zhongping Law Firm, since the telephone company in the concessions of this city changed its charging regulations, the company's manual recording of users' call counts has been full of errors. Many users have requested reforms, but no satisfactory solution has been reached. Due to the firm's busy business and frequent calls, in order to calculate accurately, the telephone was locked immediately after the change of regulations, and a specialist was appointed to manage it and record the number of calls. Unfortunately, the monthly bills issued by the company are inconsistent with the firm's own records, and the fees charged exceed the actual number of calls. In May, there were ten extra calls, and in June, there were as many as thirty extra calls. There were also three extra calls in the Chinese area, and the July bill again had fourteen extra calls. The firm previously sent a letter to the company to investigate and correct the errors, or to provide a copy of the daily call number for verification, as it was unwilling to bear extra fees that should not be paid. However, the company's reply not only refused to correct the errors, but also refused to provide a record of the call content, only urging payment and forcing people to fulfill obligations that should not be fulfilled, which is extremely infuriating.</p>
<p>Telephones are public transportation tools for citizens and are originally intended to facilitate citizens. Users paying fees according to the new regulations already feel that the burden has increased. Now, the company uses illegal counting to force users to pay for calls beyond the actual number of calls; otherwise, it threatens to cut off the line. This kind of behavior should not be used by public utilities with a monopolistic nature. If it is not seriously stopped, the losses to citizens will be unimaginable. Therefore, we dare to submit this letter, respectfully requesting that the Taxpayers' Association forward it to the Public Works Department for a thorough investigation. In addition to refunding the overpayments made by each user each month, measures should be taken to strictly prevent the same mistakes from happening in the future. Otherwise, we telephone users should also rise up and strive for effective countermeasures. Your association leads users, engages in just movements, and is enthusiastic about public welfare, which we have always admired. We hope you will forward this letter as requested."</p>
<p>The committee agreed that the Shanghai Telephone Company's inaccurate counting has caused widespread complaints. The committee has repeatedly sent letters requesting negotiations, but the company has failed to conduct research, causing citizens to suffer unnecessary sacrifices. This kind of immoral behavior should be strictly stopped immediately. Therefore, we are forwarding this letter again, urging you to bring it up with the Public Works Department for serious negotiations as soon as possible, to prevent the same incidents from happening again in the future, and to review the company's income at any time to see if it exceeds the official interest rate of one point, so that a reduction in fees can be proposed. The matter concerns the public interest of citizens, and we hope you will speak out for justice and correct the situation, for which we will be extremely grateful.</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Jones,</p>
<p>Regarding your request to resign from the position of Director-General of the Public Works Department, I and the members of the Board of Directors all feel deep regret upon accepting it.

<p>Hongwan King, Xiaoshandong from Henan, namely Qian Zupei, in November of the 21st year of the Republic, was arrested through the confessions of Hongwan sellers Shi Yinbao, Wang A'gen, etc., who were arrested by the French Concession Police. The police arrested Qian and sent him to the Second Special Court. During the investigation, the court ordered him to be released on bail with 8,000 yuan in cash, but he immediately escaped. The court confiscated his bail money and issued an arrest warrant. For the past four years, Qian had fled back to his hometown. Recently, believing that the situation had calmed down, he secretly came to Shanghai. Last month, he was arrested by the French Concession Police together with the Lao Zha Police at the Central Teahouse on Guangxi Road. He was brought to the Second Special Court for prosecution according to law. After the interrogation was completed, a date was set for sentencing. The situation has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday was the day of sentencing. At around 9:00 AM, Judge Zhang Chaozuo, the presiding judge, arrived at the Criminal Division and sentenced Qian Zupei to four years of imprisonment for selling opium substitutes, deprivation of civil rights for five years, and a fine of 2,000 yuan.

<p>Yesterday at 4:50 PM, a young woman, only seventeen or eighteen years old, suddenly appeared at the Beijing Wharf opposite the French Bund, Dama Road. She wandered around the wharf, and before long, she suddenly jumped into the Huangpu River to kill herself. At that time, there were many people standing idle on the wharf, and they shouted for help in alarm. Fortunately, a barge loaded with brooms coming from the north passed by, heard the cries, and immediately tried to rescue the woman ashore. Because she had swallowed a lot of water, she could not speak. The responsible Da Zi Ming Zhong Police Station immediately carried her onto an ambulance and sent her to Albert Road Guangci Hospital for treatment.

<p>Chen Yinhe, a native of Haimen, 26 years old, lived at 5 Yangjia Lane, Caojiadu. He was an employee at a certain oil factory. Yesterday evening at 8:30 PM, he was riding his bicycle outside when he passed by the Caojiadu triangle area. Suddenly, a robber blocked his way, took out a handgun, and threatened him, robbing him of more than 20 yuan in national currency. Chen Yinhe resisted slightly, which angered the robber, who immediately fired two shots. One bullet hit Chen's left leg and passed through, and the other bullet hit a passerby, Huang Guangqing, 46 years old, a native of Tongzhou, in the leg. Both were injured and fell to the ground. Nearby police officers arrived after hearing the gunshots, but the robbers had already escaped without a trace. They had to send the two injured people to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Baodaxiang Foreign Goods Cotton Cloth Shop at 99 Xiaodongmen Street, French Concession, recently discovered that a large amount of cotton cloth was missing from the warehouse. After the shop owner, Chai Zhifang, a Ningbo native, checked the missing quantity, it amounted to more than two hundred bolts. All of this was done by Wang Qiaogeng, a Ningbo native who managed the warehouse and delivered goods, in collusion with outsiders. It was found that he colluded with Zhang Qinrong, a Shaoxing native, a runner for the Lifeng Dye Factory at 4 Lane 52, Dalin Road, outside the West Gate, to sell the stolen cloth at a low price to Daxing Dye Factory at 1 Lane 29, Loushenfu Road, French Concession, Tongfengsen Cotton Cloth Shop at 160 Zhengjia Muqiao Street, and China Industrial Dye Factory at the Shanghai-Minhang South Extension Road in the Chinese area. After Chai Zhifang investigated and clarified the situation, he reported it to the French Concession Police, who dispatched detectives Lu Zhulin, Guo Shaorong, Wu Jiahui, etc., to arrest Zhang Qinrong on the 8th of this month. He was sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation on the first day of this week. However, the main culprit, Wang Qiaogeng, fled after hearing the news of the case. Through further investigation, the detectives found that Wang Qiaogeng had converted the stolen goods into cash and was living with a dance hostess at the Dadong Dance Hall named A Mao, also known as Fengzhen, 21 years old, a native of Ningbo. He first opened a room at the Xinxin Hotel at 309, and then Wang prepared modern furniture and rented the upstairs of Da Feng Tobacco and Paper Shop at 139 Gansu Road, Public Concession, for cohabitation. The investigating detectives, together with the Public Concession Police detectives, rushed to the upstairs of Da Feng Tobacco and Paper Shop at 139 Gansu Road at 8:00 AM yesterday. They first arrested Wang Qiaojing and dance hostess A Mao, and confiscated 180 yuan of the remaining stolen money. Wang was first taken to the French Concession Police for filing, and dance hostess A Mao was temporarily detained at the Huisi Police Station. Meanwhile, they arrested He Lin, the owner of Tongfengsen Shop at 160 Zhengjia Muqiao Street, and Xing Lianfang, the owner of Daxing Dye Factory at Laushenfu Road. Both of them had already fled after hearing the news. They also went to China Industrial Dye Factory on the Shanghai-Minhang South Extension Road with the Public Security Bureau and arrested the factory owner, Hu Zhongfu, who was sent to the Public Security Bureau for detention, pending transfer. Yesterday, the French Concession Police sent Wang Qiaogeng to the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. Judge Wang Gangxu interrogated him. The lawyer from the Police Department requested a postponement to bring in the suspect detained by the Public Security Bureau who had received the stolen goods, so that he could be prosecuted together with Zhang Qinrong. Then, the plaintiff, Chai Zhifang, accompanied by his attorney, Xu Wufang, reported that 260 bolts of cotton cloth were found missing from the warehouse, each bolt worth 8 yuan, for a total value of 2,080 yuan, and requested that the case be handled according to law. The defendant Wang Qiaogeng confessed. The court ordered the case to be tried together with Zhang Qinrong on the 17th. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>Kong Zuan, a Ningbo native and young owner of He Ren Weaving Factory on Beiler Road in the French Concession, is being sued by Huang Lijuan, a young woman from Hunan province, for seduction and subsequent abandonment after she gave birth. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhong Qing of the First Special District Court opened the trial and summoned them. According to Huang's accusation, she is 22 years old, originally from Changsha, and previously studied at Guanghua Tutoring School in Lizhiwan, Guangzhou. Because she aspired to be a nurse, she applied to a hospital in Hong Kong in January of the year before last to study nursing. She met the defendant Kong Zuan through a friend. Kong used the excuse that</p>
<p>Schools are everywhere</p>
<p>The scale is grand, not only to see much money, but also to broaden the way to further education, and persuaded her to come to Shanghai to study. After arriving in Shanghai with him, she stayed at the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA). She repeatedly intended to apply to schools but was always prevented. In April of that year, she was seduced to the China Hotel and had physical relations with him. From then on, the defendant often invited her to movies, restaurants, and banquets, and proposed marriage to me. Once my chastity was violated, I urged him to hold the wedding soon, but he excused himself by saying that his father</p>
<p>Still needed to be persuaded</p>
<p>Around July and August, he suddenly said that his father could not agree and indicated that he should get out of the relationship as soon as possible, otherwise his father would cut off his financial support. He also said that his sister-in-law would act as a mediator and asked me to accept all the conditions she proposed. Later, his sister-in-law indeed delivered one thousand yuan and presented a separation agreement. I thought this was the defendant's way of dealing with his family, so I accepted the money and signed the agreement. Afterwards, Mrs. Hua of the YWCA</p>
<p>Saw through his trick</p>
<p>Came to advise me. I once confronted the defendant with Hua's words, but Kong still swore to heaven that he would never abandon me and even wrote a pledge. On October 1st of last year, I gave birth to a daughter. Kong was very happy and named her Yuying. However, because my status was uncertain, I kept urging him to get married, but he always made excuses to delay. Recently, his attitude suddenly changed, and he openly abandoned me, leaving me and my daughter helpless. After my investigation, I learned that he had already formed another family and married someone else, which shows that his previous seduction and his current abandonment were deliberate. I had</p>
<p>Repeatedly sent warning letters</p>
<p>But he ignored them, so I filed a lawsuit with the Second Special Court. After investigation, the facts of seduction and abandonment all occurred in the Public Concession, so I changed to file a lawsuit with your court, requesting a trial and punishment according to law. The defendant has not provided living expenses for several months. Daily necessities are all borrowed. There is also an elderly father and stepmother in my hometown, but I have not communicated with them for a long time," the woman said as she wept, her face like a pear blossom in the rain. The court then questioned the defendant Kong Zuan, who admitted to having</p>
<p>Lived with the plaintiff and had a daughter</p>
<p>Without denying it, but claimed that after meeting her in Hong Kong, he took pity on her loneliness and was willing to bring her to Shanghai to help with her tuition so that she could study. He had already made it clear in Hong Kong that he had a wife at home, and the plaintiff also stated that she would never be a burden. If I were truly infatuated with her, why didn't I live with her immediately after arriving in Shanghai, but waited until the day she lived at No. 6 Sichuan Lane, North Sichuan Road? The statement that the relationship occurred in the China Hotel is not true. As for her living expenses,</p>
<p>They were never cut off</p>
<p>Etc. The plaintiff's lawyer, Hu Yongde, then presented the defendant's written pledge not to abandon her and the defendant's love letters to the plaintiff as evidence. However, the defendant's lawyer, Liu Shichao, also presented the separation agreement signed by the plaintiff and the plaintiff's love letters to the defendant to counter the claim. Judge Zhong reviewed them and then returned them separately, instructing both parties to try to reconcile out of court. If they could not reach a peaceful settlement, they would be notified of the hearing date. The court adjourned after the deliberation.</p>

<p>The Public Concession General Patrol House No. 320 of the West Third Road Patrol, on the afternoon of the 11th of this month at 8 o'clock, seized a black lacquer rattan box on Suzhou Road, containing a headless female corpse. It was sent to the Philan Road Autopsy Station. The First Special Court was notified, and the next morning, personnel were sent to the station to examine the corpse and found that she had been killed. This has been reported in the newspaper. Subsequently, the Municipal Council was concerned about whether the corpse was Chinese or a foreigner, so lawyer Li Zhishan represented the patrol house to the First Special Court, requesting an autopsy. Therefore, around 10 o'clock yesterday morning, forensic doctors Wei Ligong and Zhang Yan, together with Municipal Council doctor Smith, went to the Autopsy Station to dissect the corpse. As a result, it was determined that the female corpse was indeed Chinese and that she had suffered from venereal disease. She had also previously suffered from bubonic plague and applied plaster. Therefore, it was observed that the woman seemed to be a prostitute from the lower classes. Examining the injuries, there were only three or four small red spots on her left shoulder and a faint cyan-purple color on her lower right leg, but none of them were fatal. As for the so-called "stone woman," it was not true.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association, This Year's Budget Approved, Simplification of Election of Rickshaw Puller Directors, Last Year's Accounts Audited and Published <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The budget of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association for this year, starting from August 1, has been approved by the Council through a notice, as the Council did not have a quorum last time. According to the provisions of the budget, the monthly expenditure of the Mutual Aid Association is about 15,300 yuan. This amount actually accounts for the total income of the association and all bank interest. On the expenditure side, medicine accounts for the largest portion, about a little over one-third of the total. Direct relief and insurance account for less than about 23%. Salaries, rent, water, electricity, telephone, and miscellaneous expenses account for a little over 17%. Other expenses, such as education, bathing, tea, games, license fees, etc., account for a little over a quarter of the total. In addition, regarding the election of rickshaw puller representatives to the Council, last year, the public notary selected 400 rickshaw puller voters, that is, one person was drawn from every 100 people. By the due date, the 400 people gathered to hold an election. This election procedure has been simplified as much as possible. That is, the number of units is first drawn by lottery. After the number is drawn, all rickshaw puller licenses ending in those two numbers should be the voters. For example, if the two numbers drawn are "two" and "four" together, it is "twenty-four," and the rickshaw puller license numbers ending in "twenty-four," such as "〇〇24," "〇124," "〇224," "〇324," etc., are all voters. The remaining election procedures remain the same, that is, the two people with the most votes are the rickshaw puller directors, and the next two with the most votes are the alternate directors. Furthermore, the accounts of the Mutual Aid Association for the last year up to July 31 of this year are currently being audited by an accountant. Once the audit is completed and approved by the Custody Committee, it will be published.</p>

<p>Fang Su'an, a Ningbo native and director of Hua An Bank at No. 73 Ningbo Road (also known as Chuanxun, the young owner of Ankang Money Shop), purchased 50,000 yuan of customs treasury bonds in June of last year. Because the market price fell, Fang colluded with Ye Jingliang, a Shanghai native and manager of Hua An Bank, to transfer the treasury bonds to the bank's account, so that the bank suffered the losses. Zhang Zhigu, a shareholder, reported this to the General Patrol House. Inspector Yang Peisheng and detective Kang Zengxiang arrested Fang and sent him to the First Special District Court. Fang's lawyer, Wu Linkun, and others argued that shareholder Ding Zhixian had previously hired lawyer Yang Ruinian to file a lawsuit with the court based on the same facts. According to the principle of non bis in idem, the case could not be prosecuted again. After the court ordered the file to be retrieved and reviewed, Fang was allowed to be released on bail by lawyer Wu and others. The details have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. The patrol house suspected that Ye Jingliang, the manager of the bank, was jointly suspected, so on the day before yesterday, the patrolman accompanied Fang Su'an to Hua An Bank and arrested Ye and took him back to the patrol house. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The patrol house's lawyer, Wang Yaochang, prosecuted him for embezzlement and breach of trust under Article 336, paragraph 2, and Article 342, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. He also stated that the case was related to Fang's plan, so he requested that the cases be heard together. Ye Jingliang confessed that the treasury bonds were originally purchased by Fang Su'an personally, and Fang repeatedly discussed it with me before transferring them to the bank's account. The purchase date of the bonds was June 10 of last year, with a loss of 593 yuan. He also hired lawyer Jiang Baoli to defend him and requested that he be allowed to be released on bail. After Judge Qian Hongye reviewed the confession, he ordered that the hearing be changed to be heard together with Fang Su'an. Ye Jingliang was allowed to be released on bail for 1,000 yuan.</p>

<p>At 5:10 AM on the 9th of this month, Tao Jugui's home at No. 4 Zhen'anli, Gonghe Road, Zhabei, was suddenly invaded by several armed robbers who looted clothing, banknotes, jewelry, and other items. The victim immediately reported to the Xinzhai Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau, which was in charge, and ordered detectives to investigate. Over the past few days, eight suspects, including Gong, have been arrested. Zhong Da, the leader of the sub-bureau, learned that Luo Zibao, a Jiangbei native and former Chinese patrolman No. 319 of the French Concession, was also involved in the case. Luo lived in a shed on Haifang Road, West Shanghai, in the Public Concession. So, at 6:00 AM the day before yesterday, Leader Zhong led detectives and worked with Zhu Mengwei, the Chinese patrol leader of the Gordon Road Patrol, to secretly arrest Luo and others. Then, in an empty house at No. 111 Mazaki Road, he continued to capture accomplices Geng Desheng, Chen Chunyang, Zhou Kaixuan (i.e., Li Debiao), and Huan Qingshui, all from Jiangbei. A Dimeng brand pistol, ten bullets, and two bullet boxes were found beside Geng Desheng. Also, Huan Xiaoliuzi, a Jiangbei native, was arrested at the intersection of Gordon Road and Changping Road. Two silver bracelets (the original stolen goods from Tao's house) were found on him. They were all taken back to the patrol house for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the patrol house lawyer, stated the above situation, saying that the patrol house was prosecuting Geng Desheng for the crime of public endangerment under Article 187 of the Criminal Law because a pistol was found beside him and he had not applied for a license from the Municipal Council. After Geng Desheng's case was concluded, he and Luo Zibao and others were transferred to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Judge Tan Xinzhen questioned Luo Zibao and others briefly and immediately sentenced Geng Desheng to three years imprisonment for intending to use military firearms and ammunition for criminal purposes. The pistol and ten bullets were confiscated. Luo Zibao, Geng Desheng, Chen Chunyang, Zhou Kaixuan, Huan Qingshui, and Huan Xiaoliuzi were all handed over to Zheng Da, an official from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, to be taken back for investigation.

<p>The dispute over the administration of the Shengsi Islands in the outer seas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang occurred when Ge Tan, the Commissioner of the Nantong District of Jiangsu, and Zhao Cisheng, the Commissioner of the Ningbo District of Zhejiang, met on June 23 to conduct a survey. However, Commissioner Zhao firmly insisted that the principle of dividing the Shengsi Islands into Zhejiang must be determined first before the survey could be conducted, resulting in no results and dispersal. Commissioner Ge believed that since the survey had no results, the government would not be able to resolve the issue in a timely manner, and the most important thing at present was to actively manage them so that resources could be developed as soon as possible. He planned to reform the local military police, education, and judicial aspects with Gu Hongxi, the magistrate of Chongming County, and agreed on fishery improvement and loan methods with the Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries Experiment Field, the Jiangsu Farmers Bank, and the Fisheries Loan Office of the Ministry of Industry. He sent a letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to order them to comply. The Jiangsu Construction Department has now transferred the order to the Fisheries Experiment Field to draft a detailed plan for the relocation and establishment of a factory and to report it for approval. The remaining reforms are also being transferred for implementation. The issue of the division of the Shengsi, which has been in dispute for more than a year, will likely end without a conclusion. Xu Zhishi, a native of Yixing, Jiangsu, is a diligent scholar and has always been a teacher. He graduated from the Department of Civil Engineering of Zhejiang University in 1934.

<p>Central News Agency Special Correspondent, Berlin, 13th: Yesterday's basketball competition, the game between the United States and the Philippines, was the most exciting. American basketball is renowned worldwide, while Philippine basketball dominates the Far East. Therefore, when these two powerhouses met, the competition was intense. The American players are tall and have seasoned tactics. After the start of the game, they took an early lead of 7-2. The Philippine team resisted tenaciously, but ultimately succumbed to the disparity in strength and remained behind. As a result, the US won the first half 28-20. In the second half, the American team became even more active. Their strict defense made it difficult for the Filipinos to cross the line. After getting the ball, they never rushed forward, but seized opportunities when they arose, catching the enemy off guard. Therefore, after the start of the second half, they scored nine consecutive points. The Philippine team's close attacks were ineffective, and their long shots were even less accurate. As a result, they lost the second half 3-22. The overall result was a decisive victory for the US with a score of 56-23. The American players are tall, and if they miss a shot, they can still jump up and put it in. When the Philippine team shoots, the ball is often intercepted by the Americans jumping up. If the shot is missed, the ball will definitely end up in the hands of the American team. As for Canada's victory over Uruguay, Uruguay is a strong team with quick movements, but the Canadian team's tactics are even more special. No matter the environment, their passing and dribbling are agile and quick, without the hesitation seen in other teams. Their defense is particularly strong, and their victory was not accidental. Yesterday's basketball results: (1) USA defeated the Philippines, 56-23; (2) Mexico defeated Italy, (3) 14-17 (first half 20-7); (3) Canada defeated Uruguay 43-21 (first half 23-6); The game between Peru and Poland was not played because Peru withdrew.</p>
<p>Today's schedule is football Norway vs. Poland at 5:00 PM for third and fourth place, Austria vs. Italy will be the final on the 15th, and basketball will be the United States vs. Mexico, Canada vs. Poland, and the Philippines vs. Italy. Judging from the strength of each team, the United States and Canada are the most advantageous, and the championship will be decided by the US and Canada.</p>

<p>In the second week of the Rotary Cup tennis tournament between China and England, the Chinese team had an excellent position after winning two singles matches in a row. However, they then lost two doubles matches in a row. Therefore, the outcome of the final depended on yesterday's rescheduled first singles match. The Chinese team originally planned to have He Jialiu compete, but since Mr. He had been working hard for days and the match was very important, they changed to have Mr. Zhang Dingzhao play. Unfortunately, Mr. Zhang had carelessly fallen in the lawn doubles league match, causing a knee injury. The bandage has not been removed yet. Yesterday, he played with his injury, but De Foe saw that he could not run and attacked his weakness, causing him to lose 0-3. Now, the Chinese team has lost the right to qualify for the final with a score of 2-3, and England and the United States, who have qualified for the final, are scheduled to resolve the championship at the Kangti Club tomorrow (Saturday) at 4:30 PM.

When the Rotary Cup was held last year, Carson and Xu Chengji went to the United States to attend the Taibei Cup, which England took advantage of. Only the Huacheng Cup doubles match will be rescheduled at the Kangti Club today due to the postponement of the Lopo Cup. The results of yesterday's match are recorded below. Europe</p>

<p>(35) A Day in Venice</p>
<p>At 11 PM on the 20th, the postal ship arrived in Venice. After a simple welcome reception on the ship, we disembarked at 12:15 AM and stepped onto the European continent. There was a road in front of the pier. We marched for two or three hundred steps to a small pier, where a special ship carried us to three hotels for lodging. It was already 2:30 AM.</p>
<p>Venice is a world-renowned water city. The entire city is built entirely on water. Except for the sidewalks and a few streets in front of the houses, the rest is all waterways connected by bridges. It is estimated that there are more than 150 canals and more than 400 bridges in the city. When the special ship was moving forward in a large river, the whole city had already fallen asleep, quiet and silent. The lights reflected in the green river water, forming curved lines. The beauty of the scenery evoked infinite aesthetic feelings in people. The night in Venice is truly intoxicating and unforgettable.</p>
<p>Germany prepared three special carriages to welcome us to Venice. Originally scheduled to depart at 7 AM on the 21st, but because the ship arrived late and everyone was too tired from the journey, it was postponed for one day. Therefore, we were able to tour Venice for a day.</p>
<p>In this famous water city, we could not find a car to use as a means of transportation. Instead, there were shuttling steamboats or gondolas rowed by two people with pointed bows and sterns.</p>
<p>At 10 AM on the 21st, everyone took a steamboat to visit St. Mark's Church and the Ducal Palace. When we got off the steamboat and walked to the square in front of these two great and solemn buildings, we couldn't help but feel a sense of solemnity. Countless pigeons were parked on the square. They were not afraid of tourists at all. And if you spent a few cents to buy a bag of corn on a small stall and hold it in your hand, a group of pigeons would compete to fly onto your arm to eat, which was extremely interesting.</p>
<p>St. Mark's Church was built to commemorate Mark, the disciple of Jesus. It is said that his tomb is buried under the church. This building is a relic of the 11th century and can be called solemn and magnificent. Walking inside, the dimness easily makes people with religious beliefs feel a sense of mystery. The Ducal Palace is the palace of the Venetian kingdom in the Middle Ages. It is a four-story building that was expanded over the years from the 13th century to the 16th century. The scope is very grand. Now that the Venetian kingdom has long been destroyed, the Venice city government has preserved this palace as a precious historical site. People who go in to visit have to pay twelve lira (each lira is about equal to 30 cents in our currency). Because we were a group, we only paid half price. The palace displays stone statues of leaders of past dynasties. The carvings are extremely exquisite. All the walls and ceilings are painted with precious oil paintings. The brushwork is magnificent and extremely delicate. Italian sculpture and painting occupy a very important position in Western art. Here, you can see their spirit to some extent. Two exhibition rooms display many weapons from the Middle Ages, including knives, swords, and spears, in great variety. There are also several helmets and armor, from head to toe, all made of pure steel, fully demonstrating the martial spirit of the warriors of that era. Two machine guns from the early 16th century were also on display. Each had ten barrels. When used, gunpowder was loaded into the muzzle, and then the mechanism was used to fire them one by one. After four centuries of evolution, the weapons of killing are no longer the same as they were then.</p>
<p>The attendant in the weapons exhibition room specially led us to see the chastity belt displayed in the glass cabinet. It is said that when warriors in the Middle Ages went on expeditions, they were afraid that their wives would commit adultery, so they used steel to cast chastity belts. The shape is like the sanitary napkins used by modern ladies, with only two thorn-like small holes left for the female genitals and anus. The authority of warriors in the male-centered era over women can be imagined from this.</p>
<p>It is said that the Venetian kingdom was actually a republican political system. The king was elected by the people. It was a lifelong position, but it was not passed down to his children. There is a conference hall that is 165 feet long and 75 feet wide, which can accommodate 1,600 people. It is said that it was where kings of past dynasties convened meetings of nobles. The walls are painted with portraits of kings of past dynasties, and the ceiling is painted with a portrait of a queen, which can express a solemn expression. There are five or six more small conference halls, and the layout is roughly the same.</p>
<p>At around 1 PM, we returned to the hotel for lunch. Suddenly, dark clouds gathered and it started to rain heavily. The players, tired and exhausted, took this opportunity to rest in the hotel. When the rain stopped and the sky cleared, it was already sunset. The bells of dozens of churches in the city came one after another, shrouding this beautiful water city in a mysterious atmosphere. Some of the players gathered in groups of three or five, sitting in gondolas and rippling in the blue waves. Some strolled leisurely through the streets and alleys. Some sat in the small garden in front of the hotel listening to the band playing. Italian music is unique in the European music scene. The bands of five or six people organized in Venetian hotels and cafes are everywhere. The tunes are melodious and the tones are elegant, which is rare to hear in the country. After a hard day's work, people of middle or higher standing buy a cup of coffee or a cold drink and sit quietly to enjoy it (without dancing). It can be said that they are packed to the rafters, which shows their strong interest in music. Because we were leaving early the next morning, the players had all gone to sleep in this quiet water city before 10 PM.</p>

It has now been approved by the Municipal Education Bureau to resume. The board of directors has been organized, with Chen Lifu, a member of the Central Committee, serving as chairman, and Lu Yinquan as secretary of the board. The principal is still Lin Jun. The school is located at the intersection of Rue du Père Robert and Route Say Zoong in the French Concession. It is said that the school advocates strict education in order to cultivate useful talents. Enrollment has now begun, and the number of applicants has been quite enthusiastic in recent days. As for the school's registration issue, it will be resolved as soon as school starts, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Foreign Faculty Members Employed by National Institutions of Higher Education <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has compiled statistics on the number and monthly salaries of foreign faculty members in all schools above the specialized college level throughout the country for the 23rd academic year, based on materials collected from these schools. The main points are as follows: (1) "Number of Faculty Members": National universities, colleges, and specialized colleges have a total of 137 faculty members, public specialized colleges have 5, provincial universities and colleges have 20, and private universities, colleges, and specialized colleges have 542. The total is 704. (598 teachers, 106 staff members). (2) "Monthly Salaries of Faculty Members": National universities, colleges, and specialized colleges: 48,338 yuan; public specialized colleges: 1,250 yuan; provincial universities and colleges: 3,759 yuan; private universities, colleges, and specialized colleges: 115,447 yuan. The total is 166,294 yuan (142,046 yuan for teachers, 24,248 yuan for staff members). (3) "Comparison of Teachers' Monthly Salaries": "National Universities": highest salary 1,100 yuan, colleges 870 yuan, specialized colleges 400 yuan; lowest salary universities 50 yuan, colleges 120 yuan, specialized colleges 280 yuan. "Public Specialized Colleges": highest salary 450 yuan, lowest salary 320 yuan. "Provincial Universities": highest salary 825 yuan, specialized colleges 583 yuan; lowest salary universities 300 yuan, colleges 120 yuan. "Private Universities": highest salary 1,350 yuan, colleges 600 yuan, specialized colleges 250 yuan; lowest salary universities 80 yuan, colleges 100 yuan. (4) "Comparison of Staff Members' Monthly Salaries": "National Universities": highest salary 1,000 yuan, colleges 600 yuan; lowest salary universities 150 yuan, colleges 175 yuan. "Public Specialized Colleges": monthly salary 350 yuan. "Private Universities": highest salary 720 yuan, colleges 400 yuan; lowest salary fire 80 yuan, colleges 150 yuan.</p>
<p>(Explanation) (1) Among the 704 foreign faculty members, teachers from the United States, Germany, and France are the most numerous. In universities, there are 227 American teachers (146 men, 81 women), 72 German teachers (men, 10 women), and 65 French teachers (63 men, 2 women). In colleges, there are 10 Western American teachers (46 men, 58 women), 4 German teachers, and 22 French teachers (21 men). In specialized colleges, there are 5 American teachers (4 men), 3 German teachers (1 man), and 1 French teacher (woman). The next largest group is British teachers, with 54 in universities, 17 in colleges, and 1 in specialized colleges. The next largest group is Japanese teachers, with 14 in universities, 9 in colleges, and 13 in specialized colleges. There are also 51 Canadian teachers and 16 Australian teachers. In addition, there are foreign teachers from Switzerland, Sweden, Belgium, Holland, Italy, the Czech Republic, Spain, Australia, the Philippines, Singapore, Korea, Taiwan, and other places, with one, two, three, or four teachers in universities, colleges, and specialized colleges. (2) The difference between the highest and lowest monthly salaries of foreign faculty members is very large. Generally, the former are specially hired by our side, and the latter are mostly already in China with considerable positions and do not teach for the purpose of making a living. For example, Ms. Ya Aining, a German female teacher at Zhejiang University, teaches in China with her husband, Professor Ya Aier. She does not teach as a way of life, so she teaches very little, and her salary is only 50 yuan per month, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Municipal Education Bureau Regularly Implements Lung Examinations for Teachers and Staff in All Schools; From September 1st to October 30th, the Examinations Will Be Conducted by the China Anti-Tuberculosis Association <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau instructed all levels of schools in the city, stating: "The bureau has approved a letter from the China Anti-Tuberculosis Association, stating that tuberculosis is rampant and harmful to young people, especially the spread of tuberculosis in elementary schools, which is even more alarming. It has been found that the infection of tuberculosis in children is mostly acquired through contact with infected adults. Therefore, the health of elementary school teachers is closely related to students. For preventive purposes, the association plans to first conduct X-ray lung examinations for elementary school teachers in the city and, for the purpose of promotion, charge only one yuan per person for the procedure. The bureau has always attached great importance to school hygiene and the health of teachers and students. Therefore, we are sending this special letter, hoping that you will adopt it. The bureau believes that preventing tuberculosis is indeed necessary, and all teachers and staff in schools at all levels in the city should undergo examinations. It is hereby decided that from September 1st to October 30th of this year, every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from 9:00 AM to 10:30 AM, principals should prepare letters and go to the Hygiene Office on Fangxie Road, Linyin Road in the Nanshi District for examinations. Each time, the number of people should not exceed 50. This order is hereby issued to all schools for compliance."</p>
<h3 id="e186">Comparison of Chinese and American Secondary Education <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Shen Yizhen Lectures at Provincial Shanghai High School: Mr. Shen Yizhen served as the Dean of Studies and Director of Guidance at Provincial Shanghai High School for seven years. He has profound research and rich experience in educational topics. He went to the United States on New Year's Day in 1932 to study education at Columbia University and obtained a doctorate. He arrived in Shanghai on the "Empress of Japan" on the evening of August 11th. On the afternoon of the 12th, he lectured on "Comparison of Chinese and American Secondary Education" at the summer school of Provincial Shanghai High School. After Mr. Wang Dagan, director of the summer school, delivered an introductory speech, Mr. Shen began his lecture, briefly listing four differences between Chinese and American secondary education: (1) Secondary education opportunities are universal in the United States, while only a few outstanding young people in China can enter middle school to study. (2) General secondary schools in the United States are all day schools, while most in China adopt a boarding system. (3) The physical health and mental vitality of secondary school students in the United States are unmatched by Chinese students. (4) Secondary schools in the United States pay great attention to educational and vocational guidance and can realize the ideal of "teaching students according to their aptitude." Dr. Shen cited examples and provided explanations, which were extremely brilliant. He was full of energy when he lectured and spoke eloquently. The audience was deeply moved. However, due to limited time and the fact that the audience was composed of students who had graduated from junior high school or elementary school, he did not fully elaborate. Finally, Principal Zheng delivered a speech and instructions, and the meeting adjourned at six o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Municipal Education Bureau Does Not Issue Regulations for Employment Training Classes <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau previously received instructions from the Ministry of Education to hold employment training classes for graduates of schools above the specialized college level in the capital city, enrolling 1,000 graduates of domestic and foreign schools above the specialized college level in the most recent three years, providing them with short-term training, and assigning them work according to their scores after passing the practical examination. The bureau then forwarded the instructions and made public announcements in various newspapers. It is now known that graduates of domestic schools above the specialized college level are recommended by their original schools, and graduates of foreign schools are recommended by the Ministry of Education. All students in this city who request to attend the classes should directly contact their original schools or the Ministry of Education themselves. The Municipal Education Bureau will not issue any regulations on their behalf, it is said.</p>

All new male and female teachers for the next semester have been solemnly hired by Principal Gu Zhizhong. Many students at all levels have been registering at the school in recent days. The school has recently stipulated preferential measures to encourage students to pursue further studies and to take into account the financial burden on parents, as the students graduating from junior high school have achieved excellent results. Those who register before the end of this month will have their tuition reduced to 20 yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>Zhaohe Middle School: Next year, Zhaohe Middle School will implement a combination of education and guidance in accordance with the revised middle school regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Education.

<p>Yesterday, the market on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange showed a slight weakness amidst fluctuations. The public bond market lacked investor confidence, and major players remained on the sidelines. As a result, trading activity further decreased. Swap transactions showed a slight uptick in activity, while other retail investors made minor entries and exits, but without enthusiasm. The outlook for the next day or two is unlikely to show significant improvement. Yesterday's market opened weakly and lacked momentum. Although swap transactions caused some fluctuations in the middle, the number was limited to 5.1 yuan, with Ding-type bonds for this month being the most active, down 0.25 yuan. Issues No. 4 and No. 35 saw slightly more selling activity, while the remaining transactions were sporadic. The second session of the market became even more quiet, with many issues experiencing no price movement. A small number saw declines of 0.05 to 0.1 yuan, a sluggish situation rarely seen in recent times. The market price only showed some activity in Ding-type bonds, while the remaining issues uniformly declined by 0.05 to 0.35 yuan. The total transaction volume was 3,999,500 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>#### Demand from Sichuan Boosts Cotton Yarn Market; Compensatory Buying Becomes Active Before Retreat at Closing</p>
<p>The yarn market initially rose before retreating, but the momentum remained strong. This was due to an improvement in yarn sales, with buyers from Sichuan making a large transaction in the afternoon of the previous day. Several thousand bales were involved, but due to pricing issues, the transaction was not publicly announced. As a result, market sentiment was shaken. It is said that the market in Sichuan is calm, but inventory is surprisingly low. There are hopes for a large number of future transactions at slightly lower prices. However, due to the price surge of 5-6 yuan over three days, there may be a reaction. The market retreated at the close, but based on the overall situation, it is unlikely that there will be a significant decline in the future.</p>
<p>Near-term and distant prices each rose by about one yuan.</p>
<p>The margin call yarn market opened with strong buying interest from Sichuan buyers in the previous afternoon, causing market volatility and panic among short sellers. Due to a slight decrease in current yarn inventory, buyers began to consider moving warehouse stock. As a result, the short-selling front was weakened, and the first and second sessions saw jumps of 1.7-1.8 yuan to over 2 yuan. By the third close, some profit-takers covered their positions, causing the market price to retreat. However, the U.S. cotton and three-ply yarn markets all showed positive signs. The results of the margin call yarn showed that prices for each month rose by 0.5-0.7-0.8 yuan to one yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. It was found that 2,500 bales were sold by Deda, _ bales by Hexing, 3,100 bales by Gengfeng, 1,000 bales by Xingchang, 1,000 bales by Changyu, 1,000 bales by Shenji, 1,350 bales by Renfeng, 1,650 bales by Wandai, 2,600 bales by Runkang, 1,000 bales by Xiesheng, and 1,000 bales by Shengyuan. 1,350 bales were bought by Tongji, 5,400 bales by Mingde, 4,200 bales by Changfeng, 1,900 bales by Chongan, 3,150 bales by Tonghe, 800 bales by Senkang, and 800 bales by Dachang. The highest and lowest prices for the first half of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Over 3,000 bales of spot yarn were transacted.</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were brisk. According to statistics, all buyers bought a total of 3,130 bales throughout the day, with prices rising by 1-2 yuan. The purchase amount for each buyer is listed below:</p>

<p>The cotton market rose and then retreated, but overseas Indian and _ cotton markets uniformly rose, leading to positive sentiment. However, most cotton merchants, due to the expansion of new cotton inventory and expectations of a bumper harvest, were bearish. As market prices rose, more sellers emerged. Judging from the global cotton industry situation, it is difficult to expect prices to be too low. However, during this period of new cotton arrivals, there may be a temporary weakening trend.</p>
<p>Margin call cotton results in a rise of 0.1-0.2 yuan.</p>
<p>The margin call cotton market opened with U.S. cotton rising by 18 to 25 points due to poor weather and damage to the cotton harvest. Indian cotton also rose by 0.05 to 0.25 rupees. The three-ply cotton rose by 0.5-0.6 yuan. Market sentiment was bullish, and buying interest was strong. Bullish parties aggressively raised prices, with each rising by 0.45 yuan, uniformly breaking through the 1 yuan mark. Unexpectedly, the second and third sessions turned weaker. By the close, the yarn market was weak, and short sellers had a strong attitude. Sellers increased slightly, retreating by 0.2 yuan and returning within the 1 yuan mark. The results of the margin call cotton showed that prices for each month rose by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. It was found that 1,800 dans were sold by Dafu, 4,200 dans by Tongji, 5,600 dans by Jinchang, 2,100 dans by Hexing, 1,200 dans by Shenchang, 3,500 dans by Shenji, 3,600 zus by Yuanyi, 2,000 dans by Runkang, 1,000 dans by Xiecheng, 1,500 dans by Shengyuan, 1,100 dans by Xincheng, and 1,400 dans by Changhe. 1,500 dans were bought by Juxing, 2,000 dans by Yuanda, 2,800 dans by Zhenda, 2,100 dans by Yicheng, 2,300 dans by Changfeng, 3,500 dans by Dachang, 3,000 dans by Chongan, 3,300 dans by Yongda, and 3,500 dans by Yuanxingchang.

<p>Spot cotton transactions have not yet been finalized.</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is stable. Due to the rise in foreign cotton and futures, negotiations between the two sides have been difficult to approach, and a compromise has not been reached.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened with prices rising by 3 to 5 points for each month. News from Liverpool was positive. Dealers, local buyers, brokers, New Orleans, and short sellers uniformly bought. Dry and hot weather continued in the southwest. Weekly weather reports were unfavorable. According to private reports, the quality of cotton in Texas was inferior to before. Hedging was not active. Most buyers were cautious, fearing that the cotton harvest quantity may increase. At the close, the market remained firm and strong. Spot prices rose by 18 points, and futures prices rose by 18 to 22 points. British cotton spot prices rose by 8 points, and futures prices rose by 6-7 points. Indian cotton rose due to speculative buying. The Gujrat and Kaithi regions experienced drought, and cotton merchants bought, causing prices to rise. Later, prices retreated slightly due to long liquidation. Pingle rose by 0.5 rupees, Omla rose by 2 rupees, and Balarosi rose by 2 to 2.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 12th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast on the 13th for Balarosi for the July-August term was 224 rupees, up 2.75 rupees. Balarosi for the April-May term was 214.5 rupees, up 3 rupees. Omla for the December-January term was 195 rupees, up 2 rupees.</p>

<p>#### Wheat and Flour Prices Will Be Difficult to Fall Before Japanese Traders Cease Operations</p>
<p>After the opening this morning, wheat prices generally remained stable for all months. Due to the reboud in the price of foreign wheat by $0.40 to $0.70, industry insiders and outsiders naturally felt more active. The opening prices for each month were already up by $0.03 or $0.04. Afterwards, due to some profit-taking, the market trend fluctuated. However, industry insiders speculated that current arrivals were not as smooth as in the previous week. High-priced goods were often hedged and were not easily sold off. As long as Japanese traders did not cease operations, spot prices would remain tight, and the standard price would be difficult to fall too much. The spot wheat market saw high-priced goods rise again by $0.02 or $0.03, while mid-priced goods remained stable. Ultra-high-priced goods such as Zhangbaling wheat were $4.99, Shaheji wheat was $4.90, second-grade wheat was $0.88, Bengbu wheat was $4.90, second-grade wheat was up to $0.80, Wuhe wheat was $4.98, Zhenjiang Jiangbei wheat was $4.72, Shaoxing wheat was $4.88, Yangzhou wheat was $4.62, $4.50, Wuhu wheat was $4.75, second-grade wheat was $0.55, Dongtai wheat was $4.80, second-grade wheat was $0.79, Guangshui wheat was $4.79, Quanjiao wheat was $4.78, second-grade wheat was $0.75, and Hankou wheat was $4.73, second-grade wheat was $0.60. Fuxin handled 10,000 bags, _feng handled 50 bags, and Shenda handled 3,000 bags.</p>
<p>The flour market showed a uniform upward trend for each month. Due to the rebound in foreign wheat prices, Chicago rose by $0.40 to $0.70, and Canada rose by $0.70. Therefore, the market sentiment turned positive from the beginning, rising by $0.02 or $0.03 compared to the previous day. Northern buyers are now actively reducing their spot flour inventory. Furthermore, the wheat market has remained stable due to continuous purchases by Japanese traders. All of these factors have contributed to the profitability of the flour market. Therefore, buying interest has been very active in each session, and the market has gradually risen. Manufacturers have also reduced their selling activity due to the difficulty in importing wheat. In the future, if there is no solution for wheat exports, market sentiment will be difficult to stabilize.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of twelve to thirteen types of rice arrived from various sources, totaling 2,400 to 2,500 shih. Sales in this street were very slow. Dalian buyers handled 600 to 700 bags, so the Houzao japonica market showed a stable but soft trend. However, thin rice continued to fall with the new japonica by nearly $0.10. Du Yangjian showed no glory or disgrace, and the Yin Bian Yuan was similar. More than 1,500 shih arrived at Dongxin, and prices decreased by $0.10. Jiashan Xin Jian had no significant fluctuations.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, rice from various sources arrived from the lower reaches of the river.

<p>Yesterday, the arrival and sales of indica rice were both strong, and the market temporarily stabilized. However, Hunan rice has already been loaded for shipment to Shanghai, and cargo owners and hoarders plan to sell quickly, so the market continued to fall by $0.03 to $0.05. Jiangxi early rice mills were active in the local Ningbo area, so the market improved by $0.03 to $0.04. Buyers from Sichuan, who had stopped operating for many days, resumed operations recently. Yesterday, they handled 2,000 bags of Jiangbei rice. Shantou and Guangdong buyers also inquired about Hunan rice. Due to the active sales of indica rice, the market is showing an upward trend again.

<p>Although the new soybean market appears to be stable, both buyers and sellers do not want prices to rise too quickly to avoid attracting distant buyers. Therefore, high-priced goods are kept flat, while mid-priced goods are secretly raised by a few cents. The current situation depends on the strength of the soybean cake sales market to determine the movement of the soybean market. (Yesterday, 7,500 soybean cakes were sold, with prices rising by $0.02 to $0.03. Yesterday, factories handled over 600 bags of Duchang soybeans, 500 bags of Sanyang soybeans, over 500 bags of Poyang soybeans, and 400 bags of Poyang green soybeans.

<p>Sufficient health can make a woman more lovable. Every woman wants to be attractive because she wants the charm that every woman should have. Therefore, the prerequisite is health.</p>
<p>Sparkling eyes, rosy lips, and smooth complexion all clearly indicate that the body has received the nutrition of a special blood quality. All these beauty aids are enough to increase natural attractiveness…</p>
<p>The kind of frail woman who used to be loved by men in the past is now a relic of a bygone era and is no longer favored by modern men.</p>
<p>Sickly women no longer have the power to attract men today. What they want are spirited, energetic, and healthy women. They have realized that disease not only hinders the happiness of married life, but also prevents romantic life from being enjoyable and fulfilling.</p>

Irregular menstruation and leukorrhea are the most common and distressing ailments for women. They must be treated immediately without delay!</p>

<p>Since menstruation is a sign of a woman's health and a manifestation of her ability to create life, it should not be defiled or belittled. However, many women suffer from irregular menstruation, a tragic phenomenon that proves the uterus is unhealthy…</p>
<p>A woman with a healthy uterus and regular menstruation, no matter how ugly, has at least secured one aspect of feminine beauty. If the uterus is unhealthy, then irregular menstruation will naturally occur, such as too little or too much menstrual flow, early or late periods, amenorrhea, or painful menstruation. In addition to abdominal pain before and after menstruation, there may also be foul-smelling leukorrhea and bloody discharge, leading to weight loss, mental decline, and a host of diseases, turning her into a melancholy and sickly woman. How can such a woman be loved by men?</p>
<p>Pleasure and contentment derived from love are the most attractive elements in family life. Therefore, those frail ladies should quickly seek the path to health and not live a life of sadness and suffering!</p>
<p>According to clinical reports from world-renowned doctors, "Menorrin" is an important value in women's health products. Menorrin treatment has specific effects on qi and blood deficiency, irregular menstruation, leukorrhea, uterine atrophy, and neurasthenia, and for women without sickness to maintain health and beautiful appearance so that even after middle age, their youth can be preserved.</p>
<p>Abundant vitality is an invaluable treasure for a woman who wants to obtain feminine charm - "Menorrin" is the source of women's health, a holy medicine for solving pain.</p>
<p>Misconceptions about Gonorrhea</p>
<h3 id="e202">Reasons Why Gonorrhea is Difficult to Cure <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhang Yuanzhen</p>
<p>—Methods for Complete Eradication—</p>
<p>The difficulty of curing gonorrhea is a common lament among the medical community and patients alike. There are many reasons why it is difficult to cure. First, the acute symptoms of gonorrhea have passed and become chronic. In the chronic stage, the patient no longer feels pain and is unwilling to continue treatment for complete eradication. This is due to the patient's lack of patience. Second, the patient does not understand the principles of health maintenance. Third is the economic problem, the inability to seek medical treatment for a long time. Fourth is the nature of their occupation. In addition to the reasons mentioned above, there is also the most significant reason: there are many mucous glands along the urethra. It is difficult to eliminate the gonococci lurking deep within these mucous gland ducts. Therefore, gonorrhea that appears to have been cured on the surface can recur due to various triggers such as fatigue, sexual activity, and alcohol consumption. Therefore, to completely eradicate gonorrhea, it is necessary to completely eliminate the gonococci within the mucous gland ducts.</p>
<p>Common gonorrhea medications on the market are generally weak and difficult to kill the gonococci deeply hidden in the mucous gland ducts. The exaggerated advertisements that claim to be effective medicines for gonorrhea are not credible. Based on practical experience and reports from various famous doctors, whether or not gonorrhea can be cured depends on whether the medication used is appropriate. Among the truly effective gonorrhea medications for internal use, the German-made "918 Anli-Gonc-Tab." (translated as 918 White Turbidity Tablets) is the first choice. It is a chemical preparation with the most subtle formulation, possessing a powerful membrane-penetrating and bactericidal effect, but it is harmless to the human body. Its scope of treatment includes both acute and chronic gonorrhea in men and women, as well as complications caused by gonorrhea, such as testicular swelling and pain, bladder inflammation, inguinal buboes, and joint pain. It is particularly effective for chronic gonorrhea that recurs frequently (i.e., old white turbidity).</p>
<p>After taking "918 White Turbidity Tablets," the patient's urine will be blue the next morning, with a strong odor. At the same time, the patient will feel an indescribable sense of refreshment. After a few days, they will be able to experience supreme comfort. If you want to be sure whether gonorrhea has been completely cured, you can take a sample of urine after taking the medicine and ask an expert to examine it under a microscope. This is the most accurate method. The process of gonococci being killed day by day in the urine after taking the medicine can be observed concretely under a microscope, which can satisfy the patient.</p>

<p>606 for treating syphilis, quinine for treating malaria, are both cases where the medicine eradicates the disease. This kind of medicine that has a special effect on a certain disease is called a specific drug for that disease. If it's a case of treating the head when it hurts or treating the foot when it hurts, which is only enough to treat the symptoms, then it belongs to symptomatic treatment and is completely different from a specific drug.</p>
<p>Although there is no specific drug for treating lung disease, the human body inherently has a function for natural healing. If the patient implements appropriate methods to supplement and promote their natural healing function, it can also achieve a radical cure. Because the body's defense power is strong (that is, the natural healing function is strong), the area around the lesion can grow an extremely strong connective tissue to wrap the bacteria, causing the pathogenic action to completely lose its activity, leading to recovery. The waxing and waning of this defense function is what determines the victory or defeat in the body's war with the bacteria.</p>
<p>Because lung disease patients have been plagued by the disease for a long time, these defense functions (natural healing functions) are often hindered, and there are even those who cannot develop them. At this time, one has no choice but to rely on human power to supplement them. In fighting tuberculosis bacteria (tubercle bacilli), it is best to surround the focus of tuberculosis until the enemy self-destructs. Therefore, the natural healing of pulmonary tuberculosis (lung disease) is actually based on this principle. If we want to achieve the goal of curing lung disease, then we should understand the wonderful mechanism of this natural therapy and use it as a strategy for combat. The iron army for combat is organ therapy.</p>
<p>According to research by many scholars, the only method to treat lung disease is to supplement its physiological defense functions and make them strong, which is the most reasonable. The method of promoting this physiological defense function cannot be effectively achieved by any drug therapy. Only organ therapy can achieve this goal. Among this type of organ preparations, the only one that has been praised by doctors around the world as truly reliable and practically reasonable is "Fei Huo" Phith Weal.</p>
<p>The ingredients and efficacy of "Fei Huo" Phith Weal: This product is made by extracting endocrine hormones—Holzin—from the fresh lungs and spleens of healthy animals and mixing them into an oral liquid. Its function is to make the already weakened lung function—turn weakness into strength—promote its defense power, and strengthen the function of physiological natural healing. If there is tissue loss (i.e., where the lung has cavities), it can be filled. At the same time, a solid connective tissue wall is built around the diseased part to harden it, promote the combination of scars, completely wrap the evil tubercle bacilli (tubercle bacilli), causing them to lose their activity, and eventually completely eliminate them, leading to recovery. Therefore, patients who take "Fei Huo" Phith Weal feel refreshed, have increased appetite, thinner phlegm, and reduced coughs within a few days. Night sweats and night sweats all disappear. If taken continuously and paying attention to general hygiene therapy at the same time, victory can certainly be achieved in a very short period of time and a return to the city of health can be achieved.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Asthma Can Be Radically Cured and Not Relapse <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>Bronchial asthma, also known as asthma or phlegm asthma, is sometimes called wheezing or shortness of breath. The cause of this disease is a paroxysmal difficulty in breathing, due to spastic contraction of the circular muscles in the walls of the small bronchi.</p>
<p>(Symptoms) This symptom usually occurs suddenly at night. The patient first feels chest tightness, has a pale face, and appears distressed. Cold sweat pours down, breathing is very difficult, requiring great effort, prolonged, and accompanied by wheezing. The abdominal muscles are tense like a board, and the sputum coughed up is yellowish-green.</p>
<p>(Treatment) When the disease occurs, taking three "Xiao Li Ping" Holipin tablets (this is the adult dose) can immediately stop the asthma and turn danger into safety. If you want a radical cure and prevent recurrence, then you should continue taking it for one or two months to be cured. If you usually have chronic bronchitis (i.e., a chronic cough), the resistance of your lungs must be very weak, and the tissue is atrophied, and the physiological functions are declining. Therefore, it is more difficult to cure. You must also take "Fei Huo" Phith Weal to make the physiological functions of the lungs strong and the lung power healthy, so that asthma will not recur.</p>
<p>(Diet and care) Patients must avoid sudden changes in temperature, avoid eating irritating foods, breathe thin air, and often do outdoor exercise. Patients with physical weakness, anemia, and neurasthenia should take nutritional tonics on weekdays, such as "Mi Mei Er Brain Tonic" Memory Neurotic, which is very effective.</p>

<p>Parents protect their beloved children... How to prevent summer dangers...</p>
<p>Bacillary Dysentery and Epidemic Dysentery</p>
<p>Epidemic dysentery is the most dangerous disease among children, caused by eating uncooked fruits or spoiled food. This disease is most common in children aged three to six years, and is almost non-existent in breastfed babies.</p>
<p>Sudden high fever with cold hands and feet, falling into a coma, is epidemic dysentery; blood in the stool is bacillary dysentery. These are caused by the mischief of bacillary and epidemic dysentery bacteria. Bacillary dysentery is characterized by initial diarrhea and fever, followed by bloody stools with mucus. The average mortality rate is 16 to 30%, and it is even more dangerous in children.</p>
<p>Epidemic dysentery starts with abdominal pain, headache, vomiting, and a slight fever, followed by diarrhea. After a few hours, a high fever of 40 degrees or higher suddenly develops, and the patient immediately falls into a coma. Severe cases can die within a day of onset. Prevention: First, pay attention to food and drink, and do not eat raw or cold things. Flies are also carriers of bacillary and epidemic dysentery, so attention must be paid to prevent flies from landing on tableware and food. Special care should be taken when giving children cookies or fruits.</p>
<p>If you see that your child is dull—inactive—lacking energy, restless, has abdominal distension, diarrhea, vomiting, and a slight fever, you should quickly take "Di Chang Li" medicine Dys-etrin Tab. This can often eliminate disasters invisibly. This is the first condition to protect your beloved child from dying from epidemic dysentery. Generally, children have food accumulation and are prone to indigestion and stomach diseases, so taking "Di Chang Li" clears undigested substances in the intestinal tract, inhibits the activity of harmful putrefactive bacteria in the intestine, and can also promote the physiological functions of the stomach and intestines, strengthening the stomach and promoting digestion, and increasing nutrition. Therefore, taking this medicine has only benefits and no harm. Those who want to protect their beloved children should not take it lightly.</p>

Due to excessive masturbation in his early years, he suffered from physical and blood deficiency, fatigue throughout his body, constant headache, often suffered from insomnia, slow thinking, greatly reduced memory, and mental depression. Sore back and weak legs, back pain, and lifeless. He came to see me last month. I ordered him to take "Mi Mei Er Brain Tonic" MemoryNetirotic to nourish his weakened nerves. After about half a month, he felt that his brain was clear, his memory was enhanced, his thinking was sharp, his mood was happy, and his physical strength was abundant, even better than ordinary people.

<p>— (Report by Dr. Zhang Huaren, Hankou)</p>
<p>(1) Patient Mr. Ye, 25 years old. He has been physically weak since he was a child. Due to the harm of early marriage, he suffered from reproductive dysfunction, such as kidney deficiency, premature ejaculation, impotence, nocturnal emission, decreased libido, brain weakness and physical decline, yellow face and thin muscles, depression, resulting in a cold marital life. Ruining youth.</p>
<p>(2) Patient Mr. Chen, 27 years old. Student. Due to excessive masturbation in his childhood, his reproductive organs were underdeveloped and atrophied, looking like a child's. Therefore, he was quite indifferent to sexual life, even disgusted. He often felt dizzy, tired, headache, insomnia, etc., and suffered terribly.</p>
<p>Both of the above cases used the endocrine replicating agent "Huan Er Tong" Well Tonic tablets. They took it at home for treatment. After about a month, they announced their recovery and re-enjoyed the happiness of the boudoir. According to this, "Huan Er Tong" ranks among the top tonics for strengthening the essence and nourishing the kidneys. This is indeed not an overstatement.</p>

<p>— (Report by Dr. Xu Shengzhang, Shanghai)</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Zhao, 21 years old, unmarried. His constitution is weak. Although he had masturbated when he was 17 years old, the number of times was not many, and he stopped soon after. Since the winter of last year, he has suffered from nocturnal emission. Sometimes it is nocturnal emission, sometimes it is seminal emission without dreams. Sometimes semen also leaks during the day (flowing when seeing beauty) or a small amount of milky white liquid leaks out due to exertion during defecation. As a result, he is weak and tired, has a headache, has sore limbs, is mentally decadent, and hates his work. He purchased sperm-strengthening medicines on the market this spring. After taking them, not only were they ineffective, but he also felt stomach bloating and loss of appetite. Therefore, he consulted me last month. I diagnosed that his kidney deficiency was extreme, so his sperm gate was not solid. I immediately used "Fu Lang Gu Jing Pian Folan Tab" to treat his nocturnal emission. The leakage stopped three days after taking it. It was completely cured after two weeks of continuous taking. At the same time, I also gave him the sperm-strengthening agent "Huan Er Tong" Well Tonic to nourish his essence and strengthen his vitality. In less than two months, the hidden worries of several years were immediately removed. All the symptoms of neurasthenia disappeared, and he was strong and vigorous. It was like a rebirth.</p>
<h3 id="e210">How to Promote Abundant Milk Secretion <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Female Physician Yao Shinian</p>
<p>The nutrients in breast milk, the completeness of their combination, need no explanation, of course. In addition, such as cleanliness, convenience of breastfeeding, from the perspective of infant nutrition, nothing can compare to breast milk. Breast milk can not only make infants develop healthily, but even if infants have indigestion and other situations, it is not as dangerous as artificial nutrition.</p>
<p>Breast milk feeding has various benefits. Therefore, within the realm of possibility, breast milk feeding should be the goal. But if the mother's malnutrition—or the mammary glands develop abnormalities and dysfunction—can reduce or stop the secretion of milk. Thus, various difficult problems arise for childcare. This is a fact that we often see.</p>
<p>The main reason for the lack of milk is mostly caused by malnutrition of the mother's body—leading to atrophy of the mammary glands. If we want to remedy the problem of insufficient milk, we must fundamentally improve the mother's nutrition and promote the secretion of the mammary glands.</p>
<p>Based on my research—and clinical experiments—during my many years of service at the "Hongkou Obstetrics Hospital", if weak women take "Kang Shi Life Element" Conbour's San-Vita-Cell for several bottles during pregnancy, they can have good nutrition—strong blood and energy. After giving birth, milk secretion will naturally be abundant. And they can quickly recover after childbirth. Because the body is strong and the resistance is increased, it can eliminate all postpartum diseases!</p>
<p>Recently, the new milk-producing medicine "Mama Duo" Mammato is made from the mammary glands of cows. It has a special effect on the treatment of milk deficiency. After taking it, it can make milk secretion abundant and more nutritious. It can also nourish the mother's body. I have tested it in hundreds of doses, and they are all very satisfactory. Therefore, I recorded it in this publication to inform female compatriots who are pregnant and giving birth.</p>

<h3 id="e211">Staple Cloth: Element Yarn Silk Sells Well, Yuanfang Goods are Expensive, Domestic Factories Increase Weaving <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the cotton cloth market rose due to the soaring price of standard yarn this month. It rose by five yuan in three days, which gradually boosted confidence. The asking price for each piece of Dongpi white goods was raised by about five cents. After that, the price of standard yarn fell back, and the market calmed down. Although each factory has a shortage of spot goods, sales have not been very strong. There are still many orders from Japanese factories for September. In the past two days, the minds of customers have improved slightly due to the rise in yarn prices, and the number of fine cloth and fine twill purchased has been quite loose. Merchants are also willing to sell. The market is flat, and the price has risen slightly compared to two days ago, by two and a half to five cents per piece. The asking price for fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth from this factory has not changed. The sales of element yarn silk from this factory have suddenly increased. Xinhua Xinchun Pattern is now selling for eleven yuan, and there are no spot goods. Dacheng Gongsheng, Dafeng, Yuantong, Renfeng and other factories have increased weaving. Because Yuanfang's asking price is high, each piece requires more than 25 yuan, and even the low-end requires about 20 yuan. Therefore, domestic goods can sell well and replace them. Yesterday, the actual sales of each route were average. The goods shipped were still orders for colored cloth, twill flower velvet, line flannel, etc. The transaction of various new patterns of line flannel and crepe flannel was quite prosperous. The white goods dyeing factory continued to process fine cloth and fine twill. This street handled more than ten boxes of Jin Santa bleached cloth and more than 100 pieces of light and heavy coarse cloth. Guangbang handled more than 200 pieces of printed cloth, flannel, fine cloth, fine twill and other goods from this factory.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the 302nd auction of Yuanfang. Thirty-nine brands of goods were displayed, totaling sixty-three boxes. The original Yuanbai Prefecture silk and white foreign sand bleached fine cloth and foreign blue cloth were not included because no goods from foreign countries had arrived. In this auction, most of the fancy goods displayed were double boxes per brand. The Thai Western satin plus Xi Hu brand, because it has not been included for a long time, so the asking price is still outstanding. The asking price of each brand has a slight increase or decrease compared with the previous period. The Lion Union Monkey brand increased the code price by three cents at most. Yuan Jiu Fang Tu was a draw, Jiu Xi Qi brand increased by seven and a half cents, and Yuan Yu silk added the new appreciation Mid-Autumn Festival brand, which was quite popular among the industry. The increase or decrease of other brands was only two or three cents. The asking price for foreign red cloth was seven pounds. Because it is a heavy pound, the price is still strong.</p>

<p>(New Golden Daylily) In recent days, due to the shortage of arrivals and storage, and the need for each gang, the high price has risen to 21.5 yuan. Yesterday, it was reported that 400 pieces arrived in Zhenjiang and 200 pieces arrived in this port, an increase in number. However, the sales side said that the appetite was weak, so the trend turned soft. The number of goods opened by the number shop was a batch of Xuzhou vegetables, and the price was 19.6 yuan to 19 yuan, a little less than 1 yuan. It was also reported that Zhenjiang also opened 150 pieces of Daxing Yanghua and other vegetables, and the price was 21 yuan to 20 yuan, a drop of about 1 yuan.</p>
<p>(New Black Melon Seeds) The arrival of goods has also increased, and the price has become loose. Yesterday, Dangshanzi Xukui Zi opened more than 200 pieces in total, and the price was 15.8 yuan. The remaining Guan Dianzi was 14.5 yuan, Ji Kui Zi was 18.5 yuan, and Linhuai Guanzi Ming Guangzi was 13.8 yuan. The trend is still uncertain, and there are signs of further loosening.</p>

<p>Yesterday's green tea market was still quiet. Each European Zhuang, because the war in western Morocco has not ended, is deeply worried about prolongation and expansion, and it is difficult to expect smooth sales, so they hold a wait-and-see attitude. The tranquility of the transaction has been unseen in recent weeks. The market price continued to fall by four or five yuan. Only Zhu Cha, Fengmei, and Zhenmei and other goods were slightly sold by the US Zhuang. However, due to the tight price from foreign countries, the market price was low, and the market conditions could not be seen as good. Only Chinese tea merchants bought Qimen black tea. The British and Russian Zhuang also did not have large-scale sales.</p>
<p>According to the report of the Tea Industry Association, yesterday the green tea market transaction was quiet. Only Baitu Xingjin Gongxi was more lively, and Xiamu Tongfu still had transactions, and Xiumei Xiehe had three or four hundred boxes purchased. The remaining Zhenmei from all routes was unusually quiet. Only Xiehe had a considerable transaction with the hoarding of Zhenmei, and the price is currently being negotiated. The Dazhong of Pingshui Tea has not had any transactions for many days. Yesterday, Chinese tea entered Daxiang Mingxing Yibang, and the wholesale price was slightly lower than before.</p>

<p>— Yao Mu</p>
<p>Alone, lodging in a teeming metropolis, would I, having been immersed in the warmth of friends, feel a little estranged even if not lonely?</p>
<p>One day, the shadow of a former Japanese classmate suddenly surfaced in my memory. He said he had returned to his country ten years ago, and in these long years, we had corresponded two or three times before our communication ceased. I only heard from others that he had once attempted poetic suicide, and eventually married a geisha, but poetry remained his life's purpose and means. "Perhaps he is still in Tokyo? Perhaps he has already become a famous poet? It should be easy to find him." I thought. After that, when I was spending time in bookstores, I paid attention to the contents of literary magazines. Sure enough, in a newly published magazine, I found his work, still poetry, and as wonderfully strange as before. I immediately wrote a letter filled with humor and enthusiasm and sent it to the magazine. I waited with curiosity and anticipated joy. One day passed, two days passed, but he didn't come, and I didn't receive his reply. I thought the magazine had thrown my letter into the wastebasket.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, as usual, I had a simple lunch outside and returned to my apartment. As I passed through the reception room, a strange person suddenly stood up and called my name. I was startled. Upon closer inspection, this person was the Japanese friend I had been looking forward to. He had grown a small, brown-yellow mustache on his thick lips, and his hair was still a tangled mess of grass.</p>
<p>"Still 'manufacturing' poetry, as decadent as ever?" I couldn't help but bring back the words we used to tease each other with.</p>
<p>He smiled in agreement, and then we talked about our lives since we parted. I learned that he had indeed married and was the father of three children.</p>
<p>"Poetry is worthless here, and I can't produce more than two or three poems a month, so I have to work as a journalist." These words, coming from the mouth of a true poet, carried the bitter taste of real life.</p>
<p>Then he asked about the recent situations of the old classmates he remembered, and his conclusion was: "They have all become big shots!"</p>
<p>"Precisely where we can look down on them." I added. "But, why mention them? Do you still remember the girl from 渡　　家 you praised?" I teased him.</p>
<p>He couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>"I often dream of the scenery of × City. I remember writing a poem about the coolies coming out of the public toilet on the seaside avenue."</p>
<p>Our conversation completely immersed in memories of the past, and the innocent, uninhibited life of our youth vividly reappeared before my eyes.</p>
<p>At that time, I was also writing poetry, intentionally writing decadent and pure poetry. *Flowers of Evil* became my archetype, and the works of minor masters such as Rossetti and Swinburne, with their medieval melancholic undertones, were also what I enjoyed. The strictly controlled morning glory and the bat's daydream were the places where my imagination roamed. In action, I naturally indulged in the excitement and melancholy caused by women and wine.</p>
<p>However, in the hypocritical, shallow, Americanized school environment, this behavior was naturally seen as heresy, and my friends were limited. This Japanese friend, however, still got along with me. His disheveled hair, the mess of books and dirty clothes piled everywhere in his bedroom, and his somnambulistic strolling on campus late at night were just part of his poetic life. However, what impressed me the most was his love of poetry and his poetic customs. He was always "manufacturing" poetry, even if it was just manual manufacturing. Japanese poetry originally has a strange charm, and his imagination was even more extraordinarily strange, using words and expressions outside of poetic conventions. Although his poetry also had a morbid quality, his observation was keen and multifaceted, and it carried a slight satire. His themes were readily available. Children urinating on the road, garbage heaps, his own boots, and lampposts could all be used to make poetry. But it is precisely from this that we can glimpse the human and social flavor of his poetry.</p>
<p>As a result of associating with him, chatting and strolling together, I gradually came under his influence and felt that my poetry was too imitative and too self-centered. I also began to change my style. Unfortunately, he soon returned to Japan, and I, because of changes in my life, almost became disconnected from poetry. His influence ultimately did not produce much effect.</p>
<p>Immersed in such memories of the past, the embers of our friendship reignited. I promised to visit his home in a few days for a long talk and to meet his wife.</p>
<p>One drizzly morning, I finally found his home with some difficulty. Inside a small one-and-a-half-story, six-mat house, a woman wearing a white apron was tidying up the house, and two somewhat dirty-faced boys were playing at the door, but my friend had not yet gotten up.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I drank too much last night, and I didn't go to bed until [late o'clock]." After waiting for a long time, my friend finally came out with a sleepy face. He took me upstairs, we talked for a while, and then the woman who had been downstairs brought up tea and sweets, giving me a deep Japanese-style bow. Through his introduction, I learned that she was his wife. Traces of youthful beauty seemed to remain between her fair eyebrows, but the wrinkles on her forehead and at the corners of her eyes were like brands of excessive childbirth and labor, making her appearance seem older than her age. However, what surprised me the most was the rather desolate four walls and the empty bookshelf with few books. As I reached out to flip through his books on the bookshelf, he seemed to guess my doubts.</p>
<p>"Most of the books are in the pawnshop, what's left here is just what can't be pawned," he explained to me with a smile.</p>
<p>"Can books be pawned here? That's really great!" Our topic then shifted elsewhere. After eating the bananas that he had especially asked his wife to buy back, I said goodbye. However, "poet...wine...books...pawnshop...three children..." still linger in my mind.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Wang Zhanfu Enters the City <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>It has been about three or four days since Wang Zhanfu arrived in this ancient city. He finds everything interesting. He is grateful to have a relative living in the city; otherwise, he would never have had such an opportunity, and his life would simply have ended in the countryside. His relative, who runs a small business in the city, planned to invite him to stay in the city for a few days and enjoy the sights. The letter described all sorts of exciting things happening in the city, which stirred his stagnant heart. He sent a reply, telling his relative that he would set off immediately. After saving up enough money for expenses and pocket money, he chose a sunny day, abandoned his farm work, and, with a joyful heart, happily boarded a train directly to the city. In the three or four days since arriving in the city, he had spent every day strolling through the streets, admiring the scenery, and observing the lives of the city people.</p>
<p>That day, he was idly wandering along the street, gazing in a daze at the various goods in the shop windows, listening intently to the radio broadcasts, and finding it all very interesting. Trams, cars, horse carriages, rickshaws, and all sorts of pedestrians seemed to be talking to him. He was so absorbed in looking and listening that he completely forgot to move his feet. After a while, he grabbed a vendor, secretly took out two large coins, as if afraid of being seen, bought two pieces of hard candy, and blushed as he stuffed them into his mouth. Just as he was savoring the taste, a crowd of people nearby caught his attention. After watching for a while, he sensed that something interesting must be going on. Wanting to broaden his horizons, he rushed over without hesitation.</p>
<p>Several people were arguing in a group, seemingly over something that couldn't be resolved. He looked closely and saw that one person was holding a piece of paper, waving it in front of others, and repeatedly saying, "No, no, this price is unacceptable. It's too low. If you're sincere, add a little more."</p>
<p>Wang Zhanfu recognized it as a pawn ticket. He didn't understand the underlying principles, but he guessed there must be a story behind it. Soon, he understood that a transaction was taking place between them, just like haggling between merchants and customers at a stall. However, at a stall, they were buying goods, while here, they were trading a pawn ticket. The man seemed to have noticed that he was a good potential buyer, deliberately waving the pawn ticket in front of him, as if showing off his wares to attract customers: "Just a fur coat and jewelry, worth over three thousand dollars. Buying the pawn ticket for one and a half yuan is too cheap, isn't it? It won't do. At least you have to add a little more. I really have no choice, I'm too poor, and I can't bear to sell this valuable pawn ticket."</p>
<p>"Then I'll add another ten cents, one yuan sixty cents. I won't add another cent!" A pockmarked man shouted loudly, as if afraid others wouldn't hear, waving his hands, signaling to others to appreciate his generosity, adding ten cents, which was a very bold move.</p>
<p>"You're stealing my business, huh? Fine, I'll add ten cents too!"</p>
<p>The speaker was a burly man, as if in a fit of pique. He glared with his shifty eyes, suggesting that he was a remarkable figure, very masculine.</p>
<p>In Wang Zhanfu's view, the deal should definitely go through this time, because the seller wanted someone to add another bid before selling, and now the price had been raised twice, so he should naturally sell. He watched as the pawn ticket was about to be bought for one yuan seventy cents, as if watching someone win the grand prize. That person was truly fortunate. He shouldn't have watched others easily buy the grand prize. If he had just added another ten cents, he would have made a huge profit. He was a little panicked, afraid that the man would agree to sell the pawn ticket. He couldn't hesitate any longer, determined to join the competition and buy back the grand prize. He couldn't miss this good opportunity at this critical moment.</p>
<p>"Adding so little is not enough," the pawn ticket holder said before he could speak, rejecting the proposed condition. "This amount is not even close, are you joking?" He explained, "Major pawnshops don't pawn bad things. Aren't fur coats and jewelry valuable? Five yuan pawned, plus interest, it's six yuan total. If rich people don't buy it, they won't find such an opportunity again."</p>
<p>"No one said your pawn ticket isn't worth anything," a short person continued, "but once things are sold outside, like pawn tickets and bonds, they really aren't worth much. Do you believe it?"</p>
<p>Wang Zhanfu was secretly calculating. The items listed on the pawn ticket were worth more than twenty yuan, which wasn't much. Even if they were sold at half price, they would still be worth almost twenty yuan. Buying it wouldn't be a loss. He decided to offer two yuan. Wasn't that what the man was hoping for? But he had a cunning plan. He would add money to the man in two installments, as a tactic. Having decided, he mustered his courage and said loudly, "Ah, I'll add another ten cents for you, okay? I can see you need the money urgently, so I'll add ten cents more for you."</p>
<p>His actions seemed to startle everyone present. People looked at him with surprise, and he became a top hero in an unseen way. Sure enough, no one spoke up, and some gave up their bidding rights, turning away to buy cheaper goods with some resentment.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, someone was still causing trouble for him, the pockmarked man, who, for some inexplicable reason, added another half a dime! This forced him to raise his offer to two yuan, and the transaction was completed to his joyful expectations. He happily walked back. He presented the pawn ticket to his relative, saying joyfully, "Look, I bought something worth thirty or forty yuan for two yuan! What other business has such a big profit? This is my first time in the city, and it's the first time I've made such a profitable deal!"</p>
<p>"Ah, you've been cheated this time," the relative exclaimed after reading the pawn ticket, stamping his feet. "This is a fake ticket! It's a scam designed to trick people. Why were you so meddlesome!"</p>
<p>"Doesn't the ticket have the pawnshop's address, the amount, and the pawned items?" he asked, still not believing it. "How can it be fake when it's written so clearly!"</p>
<p>"That's all fake too. Let me tell you, you've made a losing deal."</p>
<p>He still didn't believe it, thinking that his relative was just teasing him out of jealousy of his good luck. He went to look for the pawnshop at the address stated on the pawn ticket. Once there, he would know whether it was real or fake. He walked back and forth on that street five times, unable to find a pawnshop. It was then that he realized he had been cheated. Thinking of the two yuan that had flown away, he broke into a cold sweat from anxiety and anger, and stood there dumbfounded.</p>

<p>— Liang Qiyun</p>
<p>"Living here isn't bad, is it?" - My introducer, Guo Santa, said to me.</p>
<p>Guo Santa was a short, stout woman in her fifties. She had a compassionate heart, supposedly because of her religious beliefs. She had saved a little money, but was stingy even with small amounts. - Three weeks after I moved into the back room, Chen Shi-nai from the front building chatted with me casually and mentioned these things, without any malicious intent. From her, I also learned the following about my introducer: - Next door lived a witch who worshipped a deity called West Marquis King. She had a large group of devout followers, and Guo Santa was one of her most devout disciples.</p>
<p>I quickly became familiar with my neighbors. Whenever they needed one more person for mahjong, they would never forget Yi. That was how they somehow called me.</p>
<p>Among the gamblers, Xi Boqing, the rubber shoe factory worker in the attic room, was the most interesting character. As long as he was there, everything would become lively. When he played "Two of Bamboo," he would say,</p>
<p>"Give you one!"</p>
<p>People would laugh out loud. The women would blush. I didn't quite understand, but there were probably some obscene words hidden underneath. Sometimes, when he drew a sequence, he would ask himself:</p>
<p>"Oh, should I find a partner?"</p>
<p>I didn't care for that. But everyone welcomed it, and they would burst into laughter. Perhaps they were too lacking in sources of laughter. Yes, people should laugh often. If a troubled life is not harmonized with laughter, life would become unbearably dull, monotonous, and gloomy.</p>
<p>The silent vegetable vendor, Chen Ge, would go to the market as soon as the sky showed a pale grey. In the tense atmosphere of mahjong, he possessed our unique native Chinese characteristics: composure, calmness, and patience. He was a bit nearsighted. Bending his head, his large red nose seemed to be rubbing on the table.</p>
<p>I rarely stayed at home.</p>
<p>"Brother, you inevitably have to be a bit hypocritical. People live just to get by. You should run around outside more. Regardless of whether you're unemployed or not, people will naturally respect you. Moreover, if you hide at home, even if there's gold on the street, you won't know it,"</p>
<p>The brokerage trader Yang Jianchen said to me in a lecturing tone. I had just lost my job then. As he spoke, his nose twitched amusingly, as if exaggerating his "intelligence" and "insight." Every time his nose moved, it seemed to be saying silently:</p>
<p>"See, you're such a clever fellow."</p>
<p>He was indeed too clever.</p>
<p>He committed a crime by smuggling pistols, and was sentenced to a long prison term.</p>
<p>However, what he said did have some meaning.</p>
<p>I should thank him. By spending more time outside, I quickly found a job. It was a street-running job for a fountain pen company. A profession that used a mixture of grandiosity, boasting, and seduction to trick reluctant customers out of their money.</p>
<p>When I was at home, I rarely had free time.</p>
<p>In the evenings, on holidays, I had no streets to run. The neighbors always dragged me into mahjong games. Their daily income was mostly meager, but, strangely, they were all gambling addicts in the third stage of tuberculosis. Like the rubber shoe factory worker, Xi Boqing; the vegetable vendor, Chen Ge; Chen Qibin, the husband of Chen Shi-nai from the front building; and the witch Xu Dagu, who lived by mysterious, deceiving tricks....</p>
<p>Chen Ge was also good at singing "Banben" and reading "Wooden Fish Books." In the narrow room, a group of people would often gather. Their enthusiastic, curious, and doubtful eyes floated over the stale clichés of stories like "Liu Jinding Secretly Investigates the Barracks," "Su Niang Writes a Blood Letter," "Crown Prince Ciyun Flees the Country," and "Hu Sheng's Parting Lament."</p>
<p>I often served as his volunteer advisor. He asked me to explain some of the obscure sentences and the meanings of the unfamiliar, difficult words...</p>
<p>I moved away after living there for a relatively short time.</p>
<p>Forms of life are multifaceted. - Under various forms, many people live.</p>

<p>No sound of autumn insects,</p>
<p>The night is desolate.</p>
<p>The moon on the mountaintop, trembling,</p>
<p>Casts a pale white glow.</p>

<p>The grass has been trampled.</p>
<p>The bloody wind, from the collapsed</p>
<p>Trenches, blows the dirge of death.</p>

<h3 id="e232">Moliere's The Miser <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Doi Itsuo, Translated by Ouyang Fan Hai</p>
<p>The father of Harpagon was a guy who hid in the small stable to steal feed for his horse. He desperately misses women, but the woman he misses is the lover of his own son, Harpagon.</p>
<p>The sons and daughters are driven by their father's infatuation, so they try many methods and start using money. Harpagon wants to get rid of his father's restraint, create a free love without money, and goes to see a usurer to borrow money, only to find that the usurer is his own father. Here, the old morality that forms the outer shell of the father, son, or family is already powerless. The father scolds the son for being promiscuous, and the son scolds the father for being a beast.</p>
<p>Replaced by the opposition between strong desire and pure love, the typical here is a human being bound by money, who strives to create a new way of life using various primitive methods. This essence of early modern life has continued to develop to this day, and has produced various different forms. Moliere's eyes penetrate deeply into reality, and even our modern hearts are moved from the depths.</p>
<p>Moliere does not use this play to preach to the audience, but there is probably no audience who can watch this play without laughing uncontrollably. Then everyone will think, do such interesting scenes really exist?</p>
<p>The laugh of a miser is indeed like the laugh of a strong and healthy person. We often have to suppress our laughter due to etiquette, even though things are truly laughable. We are in danger of becoming accustomed to suppressing what we want to be angry about and what we want to say.</p>
<p>Moliere's boldness in directly and impolitely ridiculing the ridiculous gives our theater a direction and gives the audience and us a proactive attitude. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e233">Starting with Moving <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Yang</p>
<p>In a place like Shanghai, moving is a rather serious problem for single people. Isn't it true that most rental ads say something like "No Families Allowed"?</p>
<p>I have lived in Shanghai for eight or nine years, and have never had any "family members," nor do I have a job. Every time I move, I feel a headache coming on.</p>
<p>"Family members?" - None.</p>
<p>"So, where do you make your fortune?" - Nowhere.</p>
<p>As a result, I have to see either an embarrassed, honest face or two suspicious, cunning eyes, but the result is the same: I will be politely or impolitely rejected.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this society that requires money for rent and guarantors for tenants has taught people a way to protect themselves: lying.</p>
<p>"My wife will be coming from home in a few days."</p>
<p>"I'm a proofreader at a certain publishing house. I don't need to go to the bookstore, I can work at home..."</p>
<p>Lies like these are the secret to my successful moves every time.</p>
<p>Also, fortunately, I am a very lazy person with a strong inertia. Once I settle in a place, I don't want to move unless the sub-landlord is too oppressive -- such as not allowing the lights to be turned on after midnight -- or when it becomes necessary to move for my own convenience. And when I do move, I don't want to move too far away from the old site, away from those roads where my footprints will be imprinted day and night, the signs of those familiar-but-unfamiliar businesses and shops, and even the men and women on the left and right who seem very familiar but are not known. Speaking of which, my strong inertia has saved me a lot of trouble with moving!</p>
<p>I have been living here for almost a month now. Needless to say, before deciding to move here, I spent a lot of time considering: First, the rent is cheap, only ten yuan a month, including the money for the amah; second, it's quiet, so I can write; third, there's a bathroom, which is very important in the summer; fourth, the food situation, there are Russian restaurants nearby, where a dish, a cup of black tea, and a few slices of bread cost only twenty cents per meal, which is very cost-effective; fifth... In short, I felt that everything was in order, and I happily moved in, telling a lie that I was an editor at a bookstore and worked at home.</p>
<p>Very good! After moving in, on the first day, I discovered a major drawback: I have to run two miles to get food.</p>
<p>I was too careless; but things really change too quickly. Last winter, there were indeed several Russian restaurants in this area, but now there are none left! Although there are restaurants nearby, I have always eaten bread in recent years. What should I do?</p>
<p>There is no way, I still have to live here. First, I really don't want the trouble of "moving"; second, it was not easy to get the ten yuan rent.</p>
<p>Day after day passed, and every day I had to run a long distance four times for food. With the weather as hot as it has been in recent days, it is really a bit miserable. The sweat I shed every day for food will probably make me an even skinnier ghost.</p>
<p>However, this time, almost a month, has made me feel a mysterious emotion towards the things around here. Even the "eating" problem, which I initially felt very troublesome, has gradually improved recently, and I don't feel it is inconvenient anymore, and sometimes I even find it interesting. At first, I decided to move after living here for a month, but now I don't want to move, and it seems like I can live here permanently... Well, that long road I have to run several times a day, those unhealthy trees nailed to the roadside, the dirty but beautifully contoured face of the young clerk at the cigarette shop, the croaking of frogs every night in the quiet of the night, and the flushing toilet that wakes me up every morning, the landlady's clatter... All these things, whether I like them or hate them, have formed an inextricable bond with my life, entangling me, making me unable and unwilling to leave them... Well, if there is no unexpected force pushing me, I am afraid that I can stay here permanently, and just live like this. I feel the distress of my own strong inertia!</p>
<p>Thinking about it, people with strong inertia are not very useful. I lag behind in everything and don't make progress easily. Other people are charging ahead, but I am still standing far behind, clenching my fists, and that's why?</p>
<p>Yes, strong inertia is indeed the biggest problem that prevents people from making progress! For example, like other people, I want women, and I also want to eat. For the past four or five years, I have always thought about women's bodies, but for these five or six years, I have been single. I have neither the opportunity to naturally meet women, nor the courage to snatch other people's "doves," so I have to endure my spring dreams in the so-called "wind and moonlight." One day, two days, one year, two years pass like this, until it becomes a kind of inertia that is not easy for me to move. Unless I encounter a strong stimulation and push, I am afraid that I can live my whole life like this. Eating is the same. When I am hungry, I want to eat, and when I have something to eat, I often want to eat something better. However, ham or something like chicken velvet shark fin will not fall from the sky for you, and I don't have the powerful hand to snatch buttered bread from other people's mouths, so I have to let it be malnourished, and it won't die immediately. One day, two days, one year, two years pass like this, until now I have become accustomed to it, and the poor, salty life has become a kind of inertia that I cannot move. If I suddenly enter a luxurious and extravagant living environment, I will feel uneasy and uncomfortable, and arouse a sense of disgust.</p>
<p>My body should work hard for women and more nutritious food! However, I am content with the status quo and do not seek to make progress. I am useless, my inertia is too strong!</p>
<p>I envy people with weak inertia!</p>
<p>It would be even better to have no inertia!</p>
<p>Well, no inertia...</p>
<p>Well, well...</p>
<p>No inertia? Are there such people in the world?</p>
<p>Yes, what kind of person would that be?</p>
<p>That would be a person that you can't figure out...</p>
<p>That would become the individualistic animal that Gorky called it. For their own benefit, they can change a thousand times in an instant, without thinking...</p>
<p>Isn't that terrible?</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>Think about it: still dreaming of visiting the Grand View Garden in the middle of the night, dreaming of entering the Land of Illusion, waking up at three o'clock in the morning, but being a hero like Liangshanbo...</p>
<p>Well, just now it was a flying eagle and a sea swallow, and in the blink of an eye it becomes a pig's head and a dog's face; today it plays a big part, and tomorrow it plays a clown; at this moment it's a righteous person, and the next moment it's a rogue...</p>
<p>If the world were full of people with no inertia or almost no inertia, wouldn't that be too terrible?</p>
<p>Well, well, thinking of this...</p>
<p>It's better for everyone to have a little more inertia!</p>
<p>However, my own inertia is too strong after all, so strong that it is rigid, dull, and non-dialectical...</p>
<p>Okay! I'll move next month!</p>

<h3 id="e234">Women's Leukorrhea <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— (Liang Neng)</p>
<p>Women suffering from venereal diseases include the vulva, urethra, bladder, vagina, and cervix, and can even spread to the uterine body, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and abdominal peritoneum, with many variations. It is difficult to determine the location of the lesion without relying on a specialized and reliable doctor. However, the most prominent of their self-perceived symptoms is the increase in leukorrhea, heat in the lower abdomen, erosion of the external genitalia, and pain during intercourse. These symptoms often subside quickly, but leukorrhea persists permanently, year after year. The mucus adheres to the pubic hair and emits a foul odor due to decomposition. Patients suffer from malnutrition, weakened physique, pale skin, mental depression, and impaired conception, causing considerable harm. However, leukorrhea is also often seen in women with physical weakness and blood deficiency, and is not limited to gonorrhea. Nevertheless, it is by no means desirable for a healthy body. In this case, a microscopic examination is absolutely essential. Moreover, in today's society, social interactions are becoming more frequent and promiscuity is on the rise. Men in cities and towns are also increasingly engaging in extramarital affairs. The spread of venereal diseases is bound to increase. Therefore, women often suffer harm unknowingly. According to my clinical experience, eight or nine out of ten women with leukorrhea also have gonorrhea. Chinese women often remain silent due to traditional ethics, hiding their illnesses and avoiding medical treatment, which has a profound impact on the future of the nation. Now, at No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, the Father and Son Hospital is selling a special medicine for the treatment of leukorrhea, called the Internal Leukorrhea Pill, priced at two yuan per box. It is extremely effective in treating ordinary women's leukorrhea and female gonorrhea. I use it frequently in my clinical practice and dare to recommend it to my sisters.</p>

<p>The Precious Scroll of Venereal Diseases begins to unfold,</p>
<p>Gentlemen, please sit down.</p>
<p>Let's recite the Precious Scroll once,</p>
<p>Better than taking wonderful medicine and spiritual pills.</p>
<p>It is said that Shanghai is the most prosperous place in the world.</p>
<p>Prostitution is prevalent, though strictly prohibited, it cannot be eradicated.</p>
<p>Generally, young men often go astray,</p>
<p>Especially in early spring, when their hearts are full of desire.</p>
<p>They may occasionally commit immoral acts,</p>
<p>And within a few days, they feel the virus.</p>
<p>White turbid discharge flows, and urination is painful.</p>
<p>If they avoid medical treatment or the disease worsens,</p>
<p>Developing orchitis, inguinal bubo, or gonorrheal arthritis,</p>
<p>The suffering of the disease is even deeper.</p>
<p>Recently, expert doctors have carefully researched and written a book on venereal diseases,</p>
<p>Which explains in detail the symptoms, treatments, and health maintenance methods of venereal diseases.</p>
<p>Those who are sick can read it as a help,</p>
<p>Those who are not sick can also increase their medical knowledge.</p>
<p>The content is rich, and the value is four corners.</p>
<p>Now, for the sake of popularizing medical knowledge, it is being widely distributed to all walks of life.</p>
<p>If you want to read this book, please send a letter to No. 300 Nianhao, Fada Road, Shanghai,</p>
<p>Personnel Correspondence Agency, with two cents for postage.</p>
<p>The original team will send you a copy immediately.</p>
<p>There are also four lines of speech. Listen to me:</p>
<p>I advise you to return to the right path,</p>
<p>Don't say that romance is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>Always keep the Precious Scroll in your home,</p>
<p>To avoid hundreds of regrets and thousands of disasters.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Opium Withdrawal Symptoms and Relief Methods <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— (Doctor She Zhen)</p>
<p>The continuous and repeated use of opium and other narcotic drugs leads to addiction. The dosage gradually increases. After a certain period, the mind and body cannot be refreshed without the supply of these substances. This is addiction. Once addicted, sudden cessation of supply causes extreme discomfort and unease, anxiety, insomnia, nausea, diarrhea, and profuse tearing, with either agitation or depression, causing unbearable suffering. This is withdrawal. At this point, if a good dose is given again, all the above symptoms are relieved and comfort is restored. Addicts only seek their own pleasure and continuously demand the supply of these drugs, unaware that prolonged use will lead to mental abnormalities, multiple organ dysfunctions, and gradual emaciation, anemia, weakness, and death. Therefore, to seek safety and health, it is imperative to rely on relief methods to break free from this addiction. The method of relief is commonly known as quitting opium. Nowadays, the medical community is exerting all efforts, using injections of various medications, or taking the patient's own serum or extracting and infiltrating fluid for injection. There are also various medications for internal use. The methods are diverse. In general, the most reliable and effective way to quit is to use internal and injectable medications tailored to each individual's constitution. I have used it for many years and have never failed to alleviate the withdrawal symptoms during the quitting period. (Editor's note: Dr. Yu Zhen has a long-standing reputation for opium cessation. His clinic is located at No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, in the Father and Son Hospital. It is said that he only charges two yuan per day for each person. A set of opium cessation rules is available and can be requested directly by mail.)</p>
<h3 id="e237">Free Examination for Gonorrhea in Men and Women <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— (Ni Shang)</p>
<p>Because some genital diseases, such as prostatitis, urethritis, and spermatorrhea, closely resemble the symptoms of gonorrhea, ordinary people often find it difficult to distinguish them. Consequently, they become privately anxious and indiscriminately take medications, which only worsens the condition. Another situation is when gonorrhea is not cured or is newly contracted, but it is not recognized as gonorrhea, leading to delays in treatment. How absurd! To distinguish the cause of these diseases, it is best to examine the urine under a microscope to determine whether gonococci are present, thus determining whether it is gonorrhea. This eliminates the drawbacks of blindly following medical advice. In Shanghai, there is a place that provides gonorrhea testing free of charge, and that is Father and Son Hospital at No. 64 Ningbo Road in the French Concession. It is also very convenient for women who suffer from leukorrhea to be examined to determine if it is gonorrhea. The examinations are performed by female medical assistants, and an accurate report can be obtained within minutes.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Gonorrhea and the New Bride <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— (Shu Xin)</p>
<p>Often, young women who have been married for not long suddenly develop a fever, become pale, and feel unwell. When asked about their ailments, they frequently feel the urge to urinate, have excessive leukorrhea, and experience pain in the lower back, joints, and muscles. This is because the pure and innocent bride has been harmed by her husband's premarital promiscuity. The gonococci find a brand-new place to multiply and spread rapidly. In a few days, endometritis and tubal abscesses may develop. If prompt treatment is not sought at this time, peritonitis will inevitably occur, causing the flower-like beauty to wither. In severe cases, they may be bedridden for a long time, become emaciated, or suffer from neurasthenia and infertility. What joy can life hold in such a state? This disease is difficult to treat in women. Therefore, if a woman frequently has a fever or suddenly experiences lower abdominal pain with radiation and excessive leukorrhea from the urethra, gonorrhea is suspected. At that time, they should seek immediate treatment, otherwise, it will spread to the deeper layers of the uterus, causing various dangerous conditions. The internal leukorrhea pills and external leukorrhea tablets sold by Father and Son Hospital in the French Concession of Shanghai, when taken concurrently, are remarkably effective. Each type is priced at two yuan and is truly a good medicine for women.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Red and White Leukorrhea <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— (Xiao Yun)</p>
<p>Red and white leukorrhea is a disease particularly prevalent among Chinese women. Lack of proper hygiene during menstruation, inadequate postpartum care, and unclean personal hygiene products can all lead to diseases of the uterus and vagina. The result is increased inflammatory secretions. Mild cases involve yellowish-white, sticky substances, known as leukorrhea. In severe cases, ulceration occurs in the internal mucous membrane, and superficial blood vessels are damaged, resulting in secretions mixed with blood, known as red leukorrhea. Some cases of red and white leukorrhea are caused by tumors in the uterine cavity, while others are caused by venereal viruses. Still others are caused by physical weakness, chlorosis, or acute and chronic simple urogenital diseases. Since there is a definite cause for the symptoms of red and white leukorrhea, it is regrettable that many women are often too embarrassed to seek medical attention, delaying treatment and allowing the disease to progress to an incurable state. Now, the Father and Son Hospital at No. 64 Ningbo Road in the French Concession of Shanghai sells "Internal Leukorrhea Pills" and "External Leukorrhea Medicine," which are highly effective in treating gonorrheal leukorrhea and simple red and white leukorrhea in women. They are the only self-treatment remedies for those who are too embarrassed to seek medical attention or live in remote areas where good doctors and medicines are scarce. Female patients should pay attention to this.</p>
<h3 id="e240">General Discussion on Gonorrhea in Women <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— (Yi Ren)</p>
<p>The cause of gonorrhea is the gonococcus, discovered by Neisser in 1879. The most susceptible sites are the urethra and vagina in young girls, and the urethra, cervical canal, and fallopian tubes in women. Gonorrhea is mainly transmitted through sexual intercourse and then spreads upwards, dividing into mild and severe cases. The former is limited to the lower genital tract, i.e., the vulva, vagina, urethra, and cervical canal. The latter also extends to the deeper parts, i.e., the uterine cavity, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and peritoneum. The predisposing factors for ascending infection are as follows: (1) menstruation; (2) puerperium; (3) excessive sexual activity; (4) intrauterine surgery, etc. The clinical findings and symptoms of each site are described below. (1) Acute stage of gonococcal urethritis: There is a burning sensation during urination, often severe pain, and frequent urination. The mucous membrane of the external urethral orifice is congested and swollen, with thick pus-like secretions containing countless gonococci. It usually progresses to the chronic stage after three to four weeks. Once it becomes chronic, the above symptoms almost disappear, the amount of pus-like secretions is greatly reduced, and the external urethral orifice is slightly congested. (2) Gonococcal vulvitis: Limited to young girls, pregnant women, and the elderly. Acute stage: There is an unbearable burning sensation, especially after urination. The labia, clitoris, and hymen become edematous. Thick pus-like secretions are present. The inguinal lymph nodes are often swollen. It progresses to the chronic stage after one to two weeks. The result is the development of condylomata acuminata, resembling a rooster's comb. (3) Acute stage of gonococcal vaginitis: There is a feeling of lower abdominal pain, burning itching, and increased leukorrhea. The mucous membrane is red and swollen, resembling velvet. Pressure causes severe pain. It becomes noticeably milder after two to three weeks. If gonococci are still seen in the secretions, it indicates that they are coming from the cervical canal. (4) Acute stage of cervical gonococcal infection: The pathogens mostly reside in the superficial layer. The vaginal portion of the cervix is severely swollen, leaking greenish-yellow pus-like secretions. The surrounding area is eroded and not very painful. It is only felt upon touching it. Chronic stage: The secretions may be pus-like or mucous. The subjective symptoms are not obvious. Microscopic examination is required to prove the presence of pathogens to confirm that it is gonococcal. (5) Acute stage of gonococcal endometritis: High fever, reaching 38 to 40 degrees Celsius. Severe pain in the lower abdomen. Increased leukorrhea. The uterus is swollen and has severe tenderness. After one week, the symptoms become milder and become chronic, making it difficult to cure. During this period, only a feeling of discomfort is felt in the lower abdomen. It often worsens during menstruation and after labor, often leading to excessive menstruation. The uterus is hard and thickened, making it difficult to conceive. (6) Gonococcal salpingitis: Mostly involves both sides and frequently affects the peritoneum, so the symptoms are quite complex. Acute stage: The affected side has stabbing pain. Fever. Menstrual abnormalities. The affected fallopian tube is swollen and tortuous like a snake. Chronic stage: The symptoms are reduced. It often worsens during menstruation and after labor. Lower back pain, lower abdominal pain, are almost inevitable. Gastrointestinal disturbances. General malnutrition. The nervous system is greatly affected. (7) Gonococcal oophoritis and pelvic peritonitis: Acute stage: There is lower abdominal pain. Nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension. Fever. Constipation or diarrhea. Rapid and weak pulse. Chronic stage: The symptoms are greatly relieved, but it often recurs. Fertility is completely hopeless. Therefore, the prognosis of this disease depends on the timeliness of treatment and the location of the lesions. Fifty percent of infertility is actually caused by this disease. It is said that gonorrhea in women is mostly transmitted by their husbands. Men who frequent prostitutes contract gonorrhea and either keep it a secret without seeking treatment or do not receive radical treatment, inevitably infecting their wives. Therefore, both husband and wife must undergo radical treatment together. Otherwise, if the husband is treated but the wife is not, or the wife is treated but the husband is not, they will transmit it to each other, causing endless harm. However, it is often inconvenient for women to seek medical attention, so self-treatment is still available. The internal Leukorrhea Pills and external Leukorrhea Medicine sold by Father and Son Hospital at No. 64 Ningbo Road in the French Concession of Shanghai can radically cure gonorrhea in women. The price is two yuan per box for the internal medication and two yuan per box for the external medication. When used together, they will quickly cure the condition. These two medications not only treat gonorrhea in women but also have miraculous effects on common leukorrhea. Many women who are chlorotic and infertile due to leukorrhea have had their complexions turn from pale to rosy after being treated with these products, and they have also been blessed with offspring. It is truly the only good medicine for women.</p>

<p>— (Lan Xin)</p>
<p>If a medicine is called an "elixir," its remarkable efficacy is evident. If a medicine is called a "pill," the excellence of its manufacturing is evident. What is the Leukorrhea Elixir? It is the internal Leukorrhea Pills and external Leukorrhea Medicine sold by Father and Son Hospital at the Ningbo Road entrance in the French Concession of Shanghai. These two medicines are only sold for two yuan each. They can treat common leukorrhea in women, as well as leukorrhea infected with gonorrhea. When used internally and externally, they invariably have the great effect of curing the disease. They also warm the uterus, regulate menstruation, nourish the blood, strengthen the stomach, invigorate the body, and benefit the brain. Therefore, many women who are infertile due to leukorrhea have been blessed with children after being treated with this product. The price is two yuan per box for the internal Leukorrhea Pills and two yuan per box for the external Leukorrhea Medicine. It is truly worthy of being called the Leukorrhea Elixir and the gynecological panacea. Moreover, the most common cause of leukorrhea is uterine inflammation, often due to the invasion of gonococci. As for the symptoms, I have already described them in detail earlier. As for the treatment, based on my experience, first, it is necessary to prevent the spread of inflammation; second, it is necessary to prevent pathogens from invading the uterine tissue; third, it is necessary to have the great power to kill pathogens; and fourth, to stop the flow of leukorrhea and relieve the patient's suffering. To achieve this goal, we must have effective medicines for external and internal use. These Leukorrhea Pills and Leukorrhea Medicine are the most effective. In my clinical practice, I use them to treat women's leukorrhea in almost all cases. The effect is excellent, and there are no adverse effects. Therefore, I praise them as the Leukorrhea Elixir.</p>

<h3 id="e242">My Thoughts on the Olympic Games <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Kewen</p>
<p>From August 1st onwards, the news about the Olympic Games has been quite lively in the newspapers. Until today, when the newspaper published "Basketball Also Eliminated, Our Team Completely Annihilated, The Games Have Nothing to Do With Us," I think most Chinese people who read the newspaper cannot help but take a look. After that, because of the "complete annihilation" and because it has nothing to do with us, it will inevitably cool down, right?</p>
<p>As for me, to be honest, I am not very enthusiastic about the Olympic Games. I do read the news about the Olympics, but it's not much different from looking at movie listings. The reason is not because I know that our team will definitely get a duck egg, so I don't get excited. In fact, it's because I still don't believe that the Olympic Games will benefit "world peace," or even "small enough," that it will benefit our Chinese sports, or that it will benefit the physical fitness of our Chinese people.</p>
<p>Speaking of the word "China," I think its correct meaning should refer to the entire Chinese population. However, what is the Chinese people's enjoyment of sports? Not to mention the people in poor and remote areas, even in Shanghai, where the sports atmosphere is the most enthusiastic, how many people can truly enjoy it?</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, or rather, to be honest, our watching track and field, our watching ball games, is almost like going to the Canidrome or the theater. We just go to appreciate it, and those who "play" sports seem to want to create a few "sports stars" like "ball king" or "mermaid," but besides that, it doesn't seem to be for anything else.</p>
<p>In this way, I think it's okay that our Olympic team returns with a duck egg. Winning wouldn't be anything glorious either, because even if we brought back a bunch of gold medals, it would still have nothing to do with our pallid people.</p>
<p>Of course, while reading the newspaper, I can't help but feel some sorrow about the "complete annihilation" of our team. But this feeling is very simple. It's just because those who were once famous and powerful in our country, such as the "mermaid," etc., were held, welcomed, and entertained without any neglect in the country, and some even condescended to coach them. When they went abroad, they were eliminated in the preliminaries, and most of the athletes were not only unqualified in the field events, but also always the last one to arrive in the preliminary races. When we went, we certainly intended to return with a duck egg, but it doesn't seem like we traveled all the way there just to run a hundred meters at the Olympic Games and then return, right? It doesn't seem like we intended to run "last" in the "preliminaries," right?</p>
<p>Secondly, what the Olympic Games gave me was a factual answer to the absurd theory of white people being superior to everything else, which was advocated by Mr. Hitler and his ilk. We will not forget the arrogance of Mr. Hitler and his ilk when they massacred Jews and advocated that colored people were inferior. But what about now? The American athlete Owens, who won three first places, is a colored "black man." This colored person, who has always been looked down upon by Mr. Hitler and his ilk, won three championships in a single Olympics. This is unprecedented in the history of the Olympic Games. And Son Kitei, who won the marathon, is a Korean, a so-called "slave of a subjugated nation" who is despised!</p>
<p>We cite the above examples not to say that colored people are superior to white people. We are not that absurd. On the contrary, we want to prove that there is no distinction between the races in the world.</p>
<p>Because of this "sports national humiliation," I heard that our authorities are preparing to set up a sports school dedicated to training athletes. The location is planned to be at the sports field, and the quota is 1,000 people each time. In order to "win glory for the country" and to "avenge the shame," their ambition is commendable. However, what use is it to train a group of star system sports stars, except to show off at the Olympic Games (whether it is possible is another question)? What benefit is it to the entire China? At this critical moment of national survival, there seem to be so many "urgent matters" that we need to do. It seems that these national decorations do not need to be studied urgently. Otherwise, even if we train them, even if we get points at the Olympic Games, it is just another Owens, just another Son Kitei. What does it have to do with our China?</p>

<p>— Meng Hua</p>
<p>——Sending Mr. Wang to Japan</p>
<p>Now, you have finally left. Leaving behind a family that is entering its twilight years, leaving behind a lonely and helpless wife, bravely holding a golden hope, crossing the vast and dangerous ocean, you are so determined. You have left!</p>
<p>I don't want to use words about how dangerous the waves are or how harsh foreign countries are to travelers like you to stop you. Everything is like a headwind, and you are like a kite. You like headwinds so much. The wind comes strong, and you rise higher. I know that all the suffering, although it has tested you, it will not make you retreat. Friend, just move forward!</p>
<p>What a treacherous road you have traveled in the past twenty-five years! But you have finally overcome all the dangers. The layers of wrinkles on your face are your scars. In this world, how difficult it is to establish our ideals! What is a small physical injury?</p>
<p>You are from Sichuan, so you must have passed through the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River. You will not forget the natural dangers of the Qutang Gorge and Baidi City! Here, I am not describing the simple beauty of nature to you. I want you to pay attention to the great artificial structures, the paths carved out of the dangerous rocks and cliffs on both sides of the river. You will not forget them, will you? They are carved so wide and so long. People who do not have much faith in life cannot imagine this, but the brave pioneers finally used cones and chisels to laboriously carve out the "road," providing a path for millions of people to walk on. Isn't the road of life the same? You have seen such a great project, you should value yourself and increase your infinite courage! What dangers can't people overcome?</p>
<p>You, no, we have all come to a dense, thorny, and primitive forest. For ourselves, for our future generations of children and grandchildren, we must muster courage and open up a path for them. There was originally no "road" in the world. It was only after human beings invested their heart and soul and energy to open it up that there was a "road." You should make good use of yourself, take out an axe, and use your own strength to open up a path!</p>
<p>You have left, and I have no gifts to send you. I will use these few words to give you a farewell. This is the burning heart of your loving friend. Keep it with you and go to a foreign country!</p>
<p>May the waves be even more ferocious, they can make you more courageous to move forward! Go, my friend!</p>
<h3 id="e244">Leaky Roof <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>I woke up in the middle of the night and heard a faint pitter-patter sound near the window. Three days ago, the glass window in the side room was broken by a thief with a diamond drill, and many things were stolen. Although my room only has a few piles of broken books and newspapers, and a few pieces of worthless furniture, if there really is a thief who visits, I am not afraid that he will steal anything. But if a fierce-looking (let's assume) man suddenly jumps in from the window, shines a flashlight in all directions, and finally discovers a waking owner lying in bed and staring at him, I might encounter a greater danger than just having a few things stolen! Thinking this, I quickly turned on the flashlight and shone it on the glass window. Outside the window, there were light rain threads, and dew-like raindrops were condensed on the glass window. There was no shadow of a thief. But the pitter-patter sound continued, which surprised me. So, from one corner to another, I carefully patrolled the small room. Finally, I found water stains leaking from the roof on the wall near the window. The leaking place was right above a bookshelf and piles of old newspapers. That sound was the sound of rainwater leaking onto the newspapers.</p>
<p>Those worthless things were my precious property. I immediately jumped out of bed. The bookshelf was placed in the air, so it was not damaged. The pile of newspapers was piled along the base of the wall, and it happened to become a reservoir for the leaking roof. From the top one to the bottom one, they were all soaked with water. I was stuck to you, and you were stuck to me. There was no way to separate them. Even if I wanted to move them, it was impossible. If it kept dripping until dawn, I don't know what the pile of newspapers would become. I was heartbroken that the pile of newspapers that had been with me for years, moving east and west, was completely sacrificed in a few hours.</p>
<p>The next day, I told the landlord about the situation last night. They had already called a plumber. It turned out that it was not only my room that was invaded by the trickle of water. It was harassing everywhere and making people uneasy. The attic had almost become a watery country. All the washbasins and foot stoves were filled with rainwater.</p>
<p>Two plumbers came. They spent the whole day repairing the leaks on the roof and replacing hundreds of new tiles. It rained again yesterday, and I paid attention to the leaking place. At first, there was a circular water stain, which gradually grew larger, and finally it dripped again. I asked in other houses, and there were still many places where it was dripping.</p>
<p>The landlord scolded the plumbers for making a mess. He called two more. They looked at the roof wearing straw hats and said that the house itself was too old, the oak wood had been hollowed out by termites, the rainwater could no longer walk along the tiles, and all the rafters were soaked with water.</p>
<p>The landlord was stunned. He said, "This ring is not mine. The main landlord is unwilling to renovate. The rent is cheap, so let's just be a little careless."</p>
<p>The tenants who suffered losses had nothing to say. The second landlord had fulfilled his responsibility as a second landlord. To repair the house itself, one had to negotiate with the main landlord, but the rent was cheap, so the main landlord's calculations definitely did not include the status of the third tenants. They only had their own interests!</p>
<p>I turned the bookshelf around, and reluctantly threw the pile of newspapers into the trash can. From now on, whenever I see it raining outside, I worry that there will suddenly be several more leaky places in this house, or right above my bed, so that I cannot sleep peacefully.</p>
<p>But when will the main landlord be willing to take out his wallet to renovate this house?</p>

<p>Cao Xiaoxiao's Jade Dragonfly</p>
<p>China &amp; West (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening: "New Baoyu Visits the Sick"</p>
<p>The Hong Mansion's Young Master and Miss Lin. Growing up together, they each harbored affection. Unexpectedly, Heaven grew jealous, afflicting the beauty with illness, trapping her in a city of sorrow. Her delicate form lay in the Xiaoxiang Pavilion, while her little maid often brewed medicinal tea. Sighing, she lamented the lack of kindred spirits, her heart moved, tears filling her eyes. Suddenly, the parrot called out repeatedly, saying a guest was knocking, calling for the maid named Juan. Hastily, she ordered the maid to go outside the room to ask who had come, wanting to hear clearly. The maid obeyed, opening the door, and was immediately moved to see it was Baoyu. Because his coming late at night was a rare event, it showed that his affection and righteousness were naturally formed. She hurriedly took the lantern and guided him inside with light steps. Reaching the bedside, she reported, "Young Master Baoyu has come alone tonight. He has come in person to visit you in your illness. I have sincerely welcomed him on your behalf. He has arrived at your bedside to see you. You may ask him to judge any grievances you have." Daiyu listened, feeling a multitude of emotions. It was as if she had seen the sun after a long rain. She had a thousand words to say, but where to begin? She barely managed to softly call out, "Cousin." Saying, "Second Aunt is truly too much. I am full of sorrow and sickness, I am about to be angered to death. Although the Old Ancestor treats me kindly, when I am ill, I ultimately cannot express my grievances. Do not hope that my body can recover without medicine; I fear we will only meet again in the next life to pledge our vows." Baoyu listened, alarmed in his heart, and advised her not to argue with the Wang family. He urged her to take care of her body to ensure her well-being, to put all matters aside, and to hope for good fortune. After offering his advice, he bid farewell. He could hardly make a sound of injustice. He could only sing these few lines as the opening.</p>

<p>Trickling spring water drips in the mountains. Everyone says the Immortal Cliff's spring water is connected. Baotu Spring has many ancient sites. The hidden hermit enjoys endless joy from forests and springs. Listening to the spring is better than listening to the pines. Mountain valleys and singing springs are the work of creation. The spring water of Huishan in Wuxi is wonderfully mysterious. The flying spring resembles ancient snow in the depths of winter. The fragrant spring is incomparably rich. Don't say Dragon Spring turns into a dragon. The Spear Method of Li Quan is incredibly strange. Jade Spring Mountain presenting sages is always empty. Su Laoquan, the Elder Su of Quan. He only began to exert himself at the age of twenty-seven. Truly, he was a great Confucian scholar of the Song Dynasty. There is much delight between springs and rocks. The sound of the spring and the stone chamber merge. Therefore, Wang Shiquan's storytelling and singing were greatly admired. The Xie brothers' Erquan and three smiles were beautiful. But now, they have gone the way to the yellow springs. A stream of springs seeks secluded realms. Flying waterfalls and springs are completely different. Famous springs under heaven are hard to enumerate. The source of the spring gurgles and echoes. Pine wind, ancient zither, and spring sounds are far-reaching. Spring water and fragrant tea have a rich flavor. The sweet spring source emerges from Twin Peaks.</p>

"Escape Reed" turns over. "Ancient Pine" stands tall before the wind. Lonely quilt difficult to sleep often "Dream Stone". Protecting the cold window giving "Snow Remembrance". Said "Xian Zhai" night cold difficult to spend lonely. Fortunately, the pot "Enduring Fragrance" accompanying the year cold. "Drunken Old Man's" intention is to comfort.</p>
