<p>綏遠特訊</p>
<h3>大青山下的英魂</h3>
<p>— 宗亮東</p>
<p>—綏戰陣亡將士公祭典禮－</p>
<p>一個晴朗的早晨，天氣雖然寒冷，但沒有風也沒有士，塞外，在大靑山下，每一個人懷着興奮的哀悼，去參加這决爲民族爭光的陣亡將士公祭。</p>
<p>這次綏戰的光榮的勝利，乃是我們民族復興的徵兆，我們應歡忻地堅强我們的信心。但是那些已經爲國捐軀的士兵和長官，我們對於他們奮勇殺敵，矢志成仁的忠魂，應該表示十二萬分的敬意。所以這决晋綏剿匪總指揮部舉行「陣亡將士公祭」，這是具有深切的意義的。</p>
<p>公祭的地點在綏遠城北三里烈士公園，說起烈士公園的歷史，又引起我們無限的悲感，那是爲長城之戰三十五軍陣亡將士而立的，過去那種抗敵的英勇史跋，我們還可以在陣亡將士塔上記尋多少忠魂義憤，我們烈士的血士還沒乾時，敵人却又來侵略我們了。但是我們忠勇的將士，本軍人捍衛國家的天職，奮不顧身的抗禦敵人，綏東綏北屢建奇功，繼紅格爾圖之後，又復攻克百靈廟，那種光榮的勝利確是五年來國難處境中所少見的。但是這個勝利的基石是我們無數士兵的血和肉換來的，我們紀念這次勝利，更不可不紀念那忠勇的陣亡將士</p>
<p>這次陣亡的將士，連長以下的長官的有八九十位，士兵總在十倍左右，而忠櫬已運回來的僅四十餘位。公祭的靈幕就設在烈士紀念堂的後面，裏面停着四十多位的靈襯，前面堆滿了弔祭的花園，正中設靈台，有整牛，整猪，整羊，茶食，水菓等祭品，香燭紙錠，憑弔忠魂，景象非常嚴肅，悲壯，靈幕正面飾以白布彩球，中間掛着國府林主席，蔣委員長，閣主任等所寄輓額，兩旁掛着各長官各機關團體的輓聯。在靈幕東西兩側已掘好墓地，他們爲國家犧牲，求得民族的牛存，該是死得其所，九泉瞑目的了，然而我們這一大羣後死者，責任該更加重了！</p>
<p>參加公祭的團體到得不少，有二十五軍直屬旅團部尉官以上人員，憲兵司令部官兵防共團訓絲隊，幹部訓絲所各隊，省政府各廳局處會指導長官公署，綏境蒙政會，蒙旗剿匪司令部，各中等學校，各報館各人民法團，以及西安平津學生代表，全體約有三千多人。每一個參加公祭的士兵或人民代表，臉上都現出沉痛的悲感，但同時也帶着一種堅毅的决心，我們敬仰，我們追悼，我們也奮發。</p>
<p>十時半，傅十席等率領全體代表公祭，儀式是很簡要隆重而又肅穆的，公祭畢有傅主席的致哀辭，他由這次綏戰軍事倥惚的情形下，精神依然很奮勇，臉上表顯着萬分的沉痛，在他的言辭裏可以看出他對於民族國家的忠誠，對於士兵長官的眞摯，大意說：</p>
<p>「此次公祭陣亡將士，意義很是深長，敵人雖然軍器精良，可是始終敵不過我們士兵忠誠愛國的義憤，我們爲着民族的生存，爲着正義和平，而與敵抗戰，把匪偽軍痛剿殲滅，終獲勝利，從這裏可以知道只要全國一致，有决心有實力，國難是可以立消的。此次陣亡將士，在民族的抗敵戰中著了光榮的奇功，我們今天來公祭，應該秉承他們的英魂遺志，永久爲民族國家的生存而自衛而抗敵——」</p>
<p>傅主席以前曾有「不說硬話，不做軟事」的名言，可見他對於自衛抗敵的决心與實力，决不徒尚空話的，我們從這次綏戰勝利的事實和他今天的話相引證是很明顯的。</p>
<p>接着又有中央衛生署長劉瑞恒，立法院委員劉盥訓，西安平津學生代表，晋察綏旅平援綏代表等致哀辭。每一位都是滿懷悲憤，慷慨痛悼，同時又寄以無限希望的。這次陣亡的將士，的確是光榮的死，他們爲保衛領土而捐軀，領土居然歸於完整安全，他們爲民族生存而犧牲，民族因之而鞏固了基石。</p>
<p>公祭禮完畢以後，傅主席等到靈前去探視忠襯，眼眶裏掉下悲憤的熱淚，接着有陣亡將士的家屬妻室子女等來拜祭，燒紙錢，西風吹着紙錢烟灰，在靈幕裏燎飛着，香燭亮亮的，彷彿在悲哀中見到希望，那種希望，是陣亡將士們付於我們每一個民衆的肩上。</p>
<p>大靑山下忠勇的英魂，在今天，一個晴朗的日子裏，永遠在我們腦海裏，永遠在我們行動上，有着一個光榮的勝利。（十一日於綏遠）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>美洲和平公約成立</h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>泛美和平會議自本月一日開幕以來。迄今已半月有餘。在這二星期的會議期間中。美洲二十一個國家團聚一堂。空氣始終非常融和。到了十三日已經商妥一個美洲和平公約。由各國代表簽字。並於十五日由全體大會一致通過。同時墨西哥代表復提出新的和平計劃。主張調整現有之各種和平計劃。合而爲一。及設立美洲法庭等等。將來此議如獲通過。必有重大的成就。茲僅就美洲和平公約申述所見。</p>
<p>美洲和平公約的內容頗爲簡單。僅有條文二條及議定書一件。條文規定美洲和平受威脅時。或美洲各國間如發生戰爭時。美洲各國政府應卽互商和平合作的方案。並確定非戰公約與賴瑪斯條約（Lamas　Treaty卽美洲和解及互不侵略公約。由阿根廷外長賴瑪斯草擬。故有此名）所規定的義務。從這條文的字面看。好像沒有重大的意義。其實不然。第一。就過去的歷史說。維持美洲和平的責任。以前全放在美國的身上。這就是說。美洲的事情全惟美國的馬首是瞻。而現在新的則明文規定。以後美洲的和平要由美洲所有的國家來共同維持。不能專由美國來一手包辦。這表示美洲各小國在未來的國際糾紛中。也有與美國同樣的說話地位。第二。美洲和平公約的條文雖很簡單。但包含有非戰公約與賴瑪斯條約的義務。非戰公約規定不以戰爭爲國家政策的工具。賴瑪斯條約更規定禁止侵略的戰爭。不承認以武力獲得的領土。假如違反這種規定的。締約國就應一致以中立國的地位。利用國際法所容許之一切政治的經濟的及法律的方法以制裁之。不過不能實施武力的或外交的干涉。這賴瑪斯條約於一九三三年訂立。簽字的雖有十餘個國家。但是批准的還祗有三國。現在把它的內容包含於美洲和平公約中而由二十一個國家一致通過。這於美洲和平的維持實有很大的貢獻。所以美洲和平公約的內容。如果仔細分析起來。是有很重大的意義的。</p>
<p>至於議定書中的重要點。是規定「任何國家對於其他各國的內政外交事件。無論直接。或間接概不許加以干涉。」這是美國善鄰政策的明文規定。也是美國放棄狹義孟羅卞義的具體表現。</p>
<p>在歐亞的侵略者到處向外侵略的時候。在野心的帝國主義者瘋在地蹂躪國際條約的時候。美洲二十一個國家竟能團聚一堂。召開和平會議而訂立維持和平的條約。這眞不能不說是一伴値得慶幸的事情。</p>

<h3>民族間的距離（三）</h3>
<p>— 徐許</p>
<p>習慣是民族的距離，言語是民族的隔膜，除此以外，我想成見也是同習慣不能分離的一種距離；警如我上面所講的，那個女孩子對我的態度，就是她腦筋中先有一僩先入的成見；這種成見是非常厲害的。我在中國常常在書中看到，也常聽人家談到英國人的驕傲，所以當我在比京公寓中與一僩英國的靑年同桌吃飯時，因爲我有這一個成見，所以决定不同他談話，比國的習慣，見面時大家終要說一聲Ｂon　loier　Ｍousieun他後進來不同大家說（桌上還有幾個別國人），所以我更覺得英國人的驕氣。但是飯後我們學起話來了，他法文比我還說不好，因爲我英文可以將就，所以言語的隔膜，終算是沒有的，大家在比國，習慣的距離，我們閒也算沒有，這距離就是我腦中「英國人驕傲」的觀念；但是他先對我說話了，他一句寒暄以後，他就談到政治，他反對法西斯，他也並不滿意英國；他在比京是學音樂，小提琴鋼琴是他的本行，可是他一談政治，同我談到三個鐘頭，我們間已完全沒有距離，我早已忘了他是英國人了。</p>
<p>西洋人比中國人印度人想容易表示政治的意見，思想的立塲，主義的同情，（假如他心中有的話）在中國，這樣的熊度是絕對沒有的；這大概因爲中國有一個錯的觀念，常以爲研究共產主義，就是共產黨徒，同情託洛斯基，就是託派要人，贊成國家主義，就是反動叛徒，所以見面大家只好默默，同談「今天天氣哈哈一而已。在這點上，我深深地覺得西洋人比較容易接近得多了，因爲談到了主張與思想，二個人的靈魂方才算是眞接觸。</p>
<p>在船上我會見一個瑞士人，他贊成莫索利尼與希特拉，贊成意國征服阿比西尼亞，意思中也贊成日本侵略中國的，他以爲不進步分亂的地方，由文明人來接管是一件於世界有益的事，有一個法國朋友，整天同他在一起，可是這法國朋友並不贊成法國，反而極力頌揚希特拉。船上我在讀一篇左拉的「失業」小說在我的重大目的還在練習法文可是他說你怎讀左拉的東西，左拉永遠講窮人呀，眼淚呀；一點沒有美感，那末在藝術上他們是唯美的，他們不成宗敎，可是我說意大利的文化的頂點就是宗敎，上帝敎蟲與莫梭利尼是三位一體的。他聽了並不生氣，反誠懇地吿訴我這因爲意國西班牙民族有極濃的宗敎性的緣故，對於中國知道很少沒有成見，可是終因爲我不贊成他根本的思想。我們間有一個極大的距離，這距離不是屬於「民族」，而是屬於思想，屬於意識的，因而使我們不能太接近了。</p>
<p>一個法國人他會討厭祖國，頌鍚希德拉，中國可以學有專長的入做漢奸，這民挨的距離到底在那里？記得是馬克斯說過，「工人無祖國」的話，其實商人何常有祖國，歐戰時德國軍火商買軍火給協的國，協約國軍火商買軍火給德國這都是事實，此外農民學生小百姓們，有時候實在只想一個較安逸的生活而已。實在，人與人之間的距離並不在於民族的不同，而在於興趣與思想之異趨，民族的距離不過習慣與成見而已，這二者看穿了慣常了也就成爲自然，譬如西洋人對於朋友間金錢分劃之淸楚，同時喝杯咖啡，要各人出各人的；同時坐一站電車，也各人買各人的票。這些地方很容易使我們感到他們的鄙嗇，其實這也只是一種習慣吧了。所以越過了這些習慣與成見，不同的民族是沒有什麼距離的，有之，則就在於思想與意義，可是牠是同樣的存在於同一個民族的。同時所謂習慣與成見也不一定不存在於同民族之間的。同民族間所以能够沒有，還是在能够互相了解與原諒。其實，許多不能了解與原諒印度人的中學大學生，也會同樣不能了解像我們蒙古甘肅新疆的同胞，甚至於我在津浦遇到鄉下的農夫的。中國敎育，某一方面實在是失敗的，許多洋樓水汀完全歐化的設備與建築，實在與中國社會生活距離太遠了，使那些四年六年生活慣的孩子，好像已經把他們變成另外一個多麼優秀的民族，他們似乎有點不屑興整民族稱爲一個民族了。</p>
<p>其實，在思想情趣上相合的人們，他們互相間對於在地上吐一口痰，或者對於一根牙籤沒有拋掉，（我想印度人或者也是用中國以前象牙牙籤或銀籤一樣，所以有這不拋去用過了的牙籤的習慣，當時沒有問淸印度人，不敢武斷，註此備考，（難道就能够影響於他們的聯合與友好麼？我們總記得甘地還有西洋女子做他的信徒呢！</p>
<p>因爲一種習慣上小處的藐視，而長留着二個民族的距離，這我覺得是有點因噎忘食的。</p>
<p>當中國留學生輕視印度人的當兒，我深深的感到，茫茫的前途是白人的世界了，卽使中國留學生早有迎合他們歐化的習慣，但假如他們以他們的成見來看輕我們時，我們的心中會感到些什麼？再回頭看過來，中國與印度的國際地位現在還差多少呢？中國的現在，實在無暇再看輕別人，應當注意看輕我們的人們了！</p>

<h3>雷鳴遠四鐸訪問記</h3>
<p>—陣地通訊（二）—</p>
<p>我們在歸綏的時候、知道了雷鳴遠司鐸也到了綏遠、熱心於救護我國傷兵的工作、我們因此伸赴大校塲公醫院去訪問他、公醫院裏住着三十餘位傷兵、我們遂乘機先去看望他們、這裏、我們看到了首先衝擊百靈廟的那架裝甲車司機者劉厚玉、他是汽車隊的副隊長、右臂受傷、我們又看到了一騎當先殺入百靈廟放火燒燬敵人火油庫而被燒傷的騎兵王殿士、他是屬於騎兵第八團特務第一連、還有在紅格爾圖被炸傷胸部的席參謀、（已因傷重逝世）一共住了三十八位、大部分都是重傷、慰問之後之退了出了出來、雷司鐸這時却未在家、便的定决日到訪、决日午前十以時、已得晤見雷司鐸、進會客室後、一會雷司鐸來了、灰布的大袍上、加着一件綉着「十」字而有了幾塊補釘的黑色肩領、是神父的裝束、頭光着、蓄着短短的鬍鬚、臉浮着笑、流露着慈祥與溫和、互相寒暄後、我們說明來意、便開始談話、</p>
<p>他原是比國人、二十四歲來我國傳敎、已經有三十六年、他到我國不久、便感覺我國敎會有許多錯誤、尤其在我國的敎會、純是外國人的機關、一種特殊的精神、來維繫敎民的信仰、敎權旁落、總覺得不大妥善、因爲他抱着挽回敎權的志願、所以一九二七年入了我國籍、便在羅馬敎皇跟前取得中國主敎的地位、今在綏遠敎區、中國主敎巳經有二十餘、外國主敎有八九十位、他說、他並不是排斥外國人來中國傳敎、而是覺得中國敎會的當事人應該是屬於中國、然後才能發揚中國民族在宗敎上的獨特的精神、</p>
<p>溯長城抗戰的時候、他領着數百敎民在前方救傷、使殺敵的將士受惠不少、這决綏戰暴發、他感覺爲國家爲地方、這是更有着義不容辭的責任、遂又召集敎民、組織担架隊、由他自已任總隊長、他由是吿訴我們以担架隊的組織和計劃、略謂這次計劃、與長城喜峯口抗戰時一樣、是担任最前錢的担架隊、組織上共分四隊、一隊三十担架、一架五人、共是四百人、都是他屬下敎區的敎民、如果戰爭有更大的進展、人數可以隨時增加、這决組織担架隊、比以前便利得多得第一、都是本地人、禦寒的衣裝都很完備、第二、活動的地域在本省、地理方面很熟識、敎民入隊的時候要立志願書、主要的是全盡義務、不受任何報酬、再則以身殉國、死後也不受撫恤、這担架隊、日內又得出發前綫了、</p>
<p>他說的是純粹的北方話、談了一刻鐘、侍者頻頻來催、說汽車已備、該去火車站了、於是他便站起來深深致歉說是不能長談、立刻就要到平地泉去、我們遂請他拍了一張照、吿別了、</p>
<p>這决綏東紅格爾圖之役、當地敎民奮勇殺敵、（綏遠各敎區都有槍枝而且有訓練）出了不少力量、犧牲不少生命、這英勇的事跡、不能不說是由於雷司鐸的偉大精神所被澤、雖然那不是屬於他的敎區、對於這熱誠勇敢而慈和的老人、我們是懷着敬仰與感佩的、（孟覺記於燕大新聞系戰地調查團）</p>

<h3>上海　工部局小學槪况（八）</h3>
<p>— 本報特訊　胡祖蔭調查</p>
<p>十六·畢業生指導</p>
<p>工部局小學自開辦迄今已有八年的歷史，各校各屆畢業生的人數共有七百餘入。各校平時對於在校畢業班以及出校的畢業生均有相當的指導。每學期開學時，各校均組織畢業生指導委員會，由校長，敎務主任及担任畢業班各科功課的敎師參加。畢業生指導委員會對於畢業班學生升學就業準備以及出校後的升學就業工作，均加以相當的指導。每學期中，華人敎育處並將函請中華職業敎育社，選派專家向各校畢業班學牛作升學就業指導的演講。</p>
<p>各校歴屆畢業生多數都是升學：就業或閒居在家者則佔少數。工部局特於二十四年起在局立華童中學設立獎學金六名（四名男生，二名女生），專爲局立各小學成績優異而家境淸寒的畢業生競考。凡考取此種獎學金的學生，可以豁免學費和　籍用品費，在局立華童中學或女子中學初中部肄業三年。現經考取此項獎學金在局立中學肄業的各小學淸寒畢業生計有十二名。</p>
<p>此外，華人敎育處及所屬各小學職敎員每年自由捐助欵項一批，作爲各小學清寒畢　生貸學金的用途。凡各小學畢業生家境淸寒而成績優異，　能考取本市公私立中學者，可向貸學金委昌會請求貸金。貸學金委員會審查請求學生的成續和家庭狀况後，可以决定應貸的金額與年限。貸學金限於學費，且規定承受貸金學生將來畢業就業後須儖先歸還，以便繼續貸與後屆的畢業生。三年來，接受貸學金在各中學肄業的學生計有十名。</p>
<p>華人敎育處曾於二十二年冬季指導各校歴屆畢業生成立工部局小學畢業同學會。同學會成立的目的在於聯絡各校畢業同學的感情，並協助母校的發展。工作方面，計有：舉行會員交誼會，調查同學升學就業狀况，出版同學會紀念刊等。近年來，各校畢業生人數逐年增加，同學會工作逐漸擴大，同學會總會乃指導各校畢業同與分別成立各該校同與會分會，共謀同學會會務的推進並協助母校校務的發展。（完）</p>

<h3>疋頭　棉布交易殊覺岑寂　隴海沿錢貨運阻滯　兩廣閩浙現需零星</h3>
<p>昨棉布市况、依然黯淡無神、雖標紗花及三品紗花均告回挺、然以隴海沿綫貨運阻滯、其他北路天津·烟台·靑島·南路兩廣·湘·滇現需均極零星、閩浙情勢亦然、市面岑寂、人心鎭定、並無囤貨心思、且日商洋行有趁此高價拋售各月份白貨細布·細斜·原布之意、致人氣立挫、售盤每疋均微廉二分半五分之譜、直貢·嗶嘰·綫呢及印花貨市盤尙穩定、本色斜紋絨以銷令已見短促、市氣程虛、價亦漸落、較之頂峯時回落一角至五角不等·白襯絨·條絨亦稍廉宜、春令府綢上月湘蜀裝去大批存貢後、目下繼光中華德之後、仁豐麗明華陽天一等廠亦已有貨應市、遠路客帮紛紛報樣成交尙不多、以上各廠開售之貨均係色素府綢、價每碼較今春增起六分之譜、至於條子府綢多數須候美恒廠開出後、始行開價云、</p>
<h3>黑灰馬褲呢搜羅殆盡</h3>
<p>三十號黑灰馬褲呢、近來軋缺異常、沽價比他色每碼可抬高三四角、尙嫌缺貨、章華貨愈形缺佾、雖廠方趕出、仍不敷求、西貨日貨前因價昂銷呆、今因天寒實銷在增、國貨日貨多缺乏、西貨市面因之亦跟高不少、黑灰顏色、國貨及非國貨一律搜羅殆盡、昨章華綿羊圖馬褲呢躉批售六元二角半、黑灰空盤乏貨、喊售六元六角、西貨一〇〇五爲七元六角、黑灰八元三四角、尙覺缺貨云、</p>
<h3>金融　大戶空頭仍有翻多　標金欲跌不易　掉期多頭貼出二元半</h3>

<p>晨開爲一一六二元三角、較前收升二角、恒餘大昌祥恒昌永元亨一大愼餘洽豐永俱進、即漲到六元八角、大德成大恒餘利豐福與永鼎康同泰昌連袂脫售、降爲四元四角、元茂永大德成一大仍進、邐豐銀行掛牌揭曉英美俱平、升爲五元半、白銀平衡稅揭曉縮半分、仍形不支、福興永恒餘大昌祥恒昌永紛紛脫手、逐漸降至三元半、利豐大昌祥福興永生源永錦豐永補進、升至五元、大昌祥洽豐永元茂永趁高脱售、降爲四元三角、同豐恒福興永仍納、午收爲一一六四元四角、</p>

<h3>滙市昨忽緊後稍鬆　結果尙軟趨勢漸定</h3>
<p>滙市昨初緊後鬆、華商力結後略現疲乏、查晨初以海外電吿、倫敦大條近期縮〇六二五、遠期縮一二五、紐約銀市縮二五、蒙得里遠期銀價縮五毫至一」釐不等、倫敦生金跌二便士、英對美長六二五、英對法勿動、美對英升七五、美對法長五六二五、中央銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平、海關金單位跌三釐、匯市晨開近期賣價、英匯一先令二便士四〇六二五、美匯二十九元半、較之前收、計英緊〇三一二五、美匯則平、開後銀行紛紛塞出、華商又扒而緊、無奈銀行賣胃亦濃、日行續拋東匯、匯豐銀行掛牌英美俱平、以及白銀平衡稅跌半分、逐漸平和、後以新豐洋行來扒先令而盤、後市日行仍塞東滙、中行等力拋現美金、浙江塞出先令、時局消息轉佳而稍鬆、日行則仍扒先令、迨收盤近期賣價、英滙一先令二便士三七五、美匯二十九元半、較之前收、計英緊〇六二五、美余則平、遠期則英緊〇三一二五、美金則平、華商約扒先令七萬鎊、美金四十萬、今將成交錄後、</p>

<h3>證劵　公債已見上騰　統甲竟好一元一角半</h3>
<p>昨日華商證券交易所公債市况、趨勢於混沌狀態中、轉趨上挺、人氣亦因時局之醞釀、續見渺茫、檯面賣買、初因局勢惡劣、散戶拋賣及空戶加碼、頗爲踴躍、惟一部份大戶收買甚湧、故市價於多空擯持下、漲跌頗不一致、至收市因陜事有和緩之傳言、大戶復起拉抬、市况一致昂騰、昨日上午開盤、趨勢極爲紊亂、十·卅七·號等買胃甚爲濃厚、散戶亦多買進、市價自戊至甲種、均上漲二三角、惟六·卅五號等頗多賣出、丙種則小一角、次盤市况轉呈堅定、四十七號補空甚湧、十·十一號等亦有收購、市價一致續昂一角一至五角半、乙種本月回跌二角、而五·六號等亦一見出售、下午開盤、掉期交易頗湧、四十七·五·一十一號等均轉有買進、散戶則頗多掉期、卅五·一四號賣出不少、市價爲多空相持、祗二三角之參一差、收盤因有較佳之報載消息、人氣轉定、十·七十二·卅二號等均奮告收購、市價一致上騰一角至六角半、惟四·七十七號仍有賣出、丁種遠期回小一角、全日結果、一致上漲二角至一元不等、甲種竟好一元一角半之譜、成交總數、計一千八百六十五萬五千元、茲將其漲跌高低比較、列表如左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>糧食　抵空紛起　麵粉跌後又回頭　各月反漲三四分</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面呈初平權則回振之象以洋麥報價、芝加哥回好一二角不等、坎拿大近好二角、遠跌一三角左右、當開價時、以洋麥互有上落、市塲人心、大致觀望、各月份之交易、了結居多、新賣買已占少數、因目下局勢不定、經營者不免議強紛紛、莫衷一是也、迨至下午開盤、初尚平靜、旋以外行空頭抵補、廠方在比情勢之下、當然無新籌碼之套售因此買氣略盛、市氣卽易高抬、各月份較之前日、計漲三四分左右不等云、</p>
<h3>麥價所漲甚微</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份互有上落、本月份因交易不暢、市呈停頓、較前日微小一分、三月份則因買氣較盛、曾漲五六分不等、三四月份則一無出入、迨至下午開盤、交易比較活絡、市氣亦略呈生氣、十部分人心終以時局緩和、交通不生阻礙、此種市值、當不致冉呈騰達也、現麥市面、依然平穩、開江北麥六元九角、紹興麥六元八角四分、東台麥六元八角七分、由福新辦三千包、單豐辦一千包云、</p>
<h3>油鹽俱貴　米麵同昂　—一般之生活維難—</h3>
<p>油鹽，爲人生食料中所不可或缺，自從鹽稅加重，並改用市秤之後，無形中已增加不少，現在上海買一元之鹽，連蒲包的及舊枰七斤而弱，（市秤每斤約三百五六十文）故有謂今年醃鹹菜大不合算，每靑菜一担，小販討價常在兩元七八角，卽使論價成功，亦非一元七八角或兩元不可，一担之菜，用鹽六七斤，則成本已非三元不辦，吃鹽熬生菜爲最刻苦之食品，而已如此，一般貧窮階級之生活，難堪可想。</p>
<p>油亦爲煮菜所必需，向來小戶人家買油一二百文，可應一日烹調之需。而今年豆油之價，現已至廿五元半，比去年高起一倍餘，生油亦至二十三元三角，雖出加倍之費，難得去年之量。</p>
<p>尤其麵粉之價，高至四元三角以上，一般麵食，油貴麵貴，卽淸晨一頓點心，恐亦要多費幾個銅板。</p>
<p>連日米價亦見上升，閘北特別粳己至十一元六角五分，其餘各路米亦在十元以上，以市斛與舊時之海斛相較，小去</p>
<p>一成半，故若用舊斛計算，何止此數，際此出新時期，價已如是，來日正不知如何。</p>
<p>麥價遠期昨亦開至七元三角七，沛東黃豆現貨開至六元三角，四月期豆收盤已至六元七角九，</p>
<p>河米無一不漲　（滬北）昨日河下各路到船無幾、約二十六七號、因天時陰濕、市上各貨去路活潑、市價高頂白梗加緊數分、中决價加一角左右、薄稻大連及津烟等辦買頗濃、本街去路亦活絡、價昂角外、早稻跟漲二角、變元銷亦爽快、價又加二角零、羊杜埠客尖價加幾分至一角、其餘各貨亦加緊近尺、</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、共到八十餘號貨共萬六千三四百石、內中薄稻有六下餘號、天雨人心頗堅、本街銷暢尚可、平津靑烟等帮亦續辦薄稻八千餘包、厚粳則祗辦四五百包、故市况續秀厚薄粳行情悉加五分、惟晚市趨勢、薄稻包胃已不若日前之急、今市或有站定可能、杜洋尖無榮辱、陰元貨乏胃香、續升角外、</p>
<h3>運陜各米中途退回</h3>
<p>昨客秈到頭續旺、而去化仍　、市面依然平軟無神、惟本街辦胃尙佳、泉州亦稍辦裝、而貨主並不急求脫手、市面尙能站住、但聞陝軍在長江採辦之米糧均已停運、此間車運西安之本客各米亦有中途退回之訊、故人心不免軟弱、全日開出江西米二千包、湘米一千五百包、滬甬米三百包、行情均與前市相似云、</p>
<h3>連電一再報跌　標豆急轉直下　芝蔴再見新高價　期油餅昨亦回小</h3>
<p>昨標準油豆餅市、午前開市後、承前日漲風、市面依然挺站、標豆有業外問津與補空交易、市價續見蓬勃、比之前日收價續漲數分至角許、繼聞大迷回　、行多首先拋套、而連電一再報跌後、市面臨見急轉直下、粉紛反跌、標豆跌勢更在、午後低價比之最間高價相差達二三角之鉅、尤以四月份爲甚、計差三角三分、收市稍定、較之前日收價則標豆反小一角七分及一角左石五分不等、標餅反小五六七分、標油小三四角至六角半不一、</p>
<p>昨日現貨黃竟市况，晨市因大連續漲、致人心再緊、行情見砌一角外、午後因聞大連市回小、市氣卽行轉平、標準　跌、現貨勢屬擯持、統市做開四平街豆三車、漢口乍豆三千包、九江遲豆一千餘包各種杜豆四五百包、洋莊芝蔴、前日曾開十五元二角、由恰和洋行辦去一百噸、繼後曾喊至十五元四角、聞辦胃不貪、故未成交、刻下市勢、暫呈半穩、各種特殊新高價、或可保守一時矣、</p>
<h3>糖市　新刁靑首批不日可到</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平平、公會划盤二四粗砂白現貨二十一元六角、轉口貨六元二角、東白四鬆（J）嘜現貨二十一元六角、曾有成交、其餘均無更動、本廠綿白擬記大薩金心等一號均持原價、號盤有潮帮開出現貨新潮靑數十包、價爲十四元一二角、惟後市勢必續鬆、故下週二可出之貨僅開十三元七角、比小四角、成交百數包、昨廣東輪所到之新祝靑　出百餘包、貨較遜、價爲十三元、比小近元、聞首批新刁靑已在途中、不日亦可抵申、惜運下過遲、適值轉降之際、難冀善價矣、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新到桂圓待開盤　時局關係…行方進意仍淡</h3>
<p>前批所到泉州桂圓等、當時因客方望漲過奢、相持迄未成槃、近來號行雙方漸有接近可能、乃爲西安事變關係、行方進意復淡、又受阻擱、大致須俟事態安妥、再事進行談價、查桂圓脚地據各產區報吿、均極堅固、後市似無過鬆之望、然此閒進戶以值茲局勢、意欲稍抑人手、亦常情耳、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲市久寂思動</h3>
<p>洋莊絲交易熱鬧　用戶絲亦覽興奮、</p>
<p>昨日絲市、國內外均見相當蘇醒、紐約日絲八三度漲四分、七五度漲三分、廣東絲漲三分、上海絲漲四分、交易所實售、近遠期漲二分至二分半、橫濱現貨漲一〇元、期貨漲一三元、里昂仍持原價、觀此可見海外絲市、已漸轉良好，故申埠絲交亦復熱鬧、行盤隨之上挺如SL牌一三·一五條份、昨售開七八〇元、則較十五日之行市已高一〇元許、美莊白廠七八勻度、售開七四〇元、RR售開七六〇元、均較週前挺秀不少、印莊邇日似見滿足、用戶絲交則漸覺興奮、上海絲市或將久靜思動矣、</p>
<h3>英倫祁門紅茶獨見暢銷</h3>
<p>英倫紅茶市面、近來暢滯不一、錫蘭爪哇等路貨及中國兩湖紅茶、銷路均較前數月見呆、據英茶商葛福雷氏最近調查估計、倫敦市粗莊紅茶、存底尚有二千二百餘萬磅、值茲商業衰疲之、秋銷售殊感不易、但中國高莊祁門紅茶、因品質特殊之故、獨見暢銷、現時更因存貨薄弱、冬至汛銷胃激增、市價每磅提漲二辨士又二五、</p>

<h3>一個人在苗團內的幻想</h3>
<p>— 仰暇</p>
<p>一進門，首先就暗地裏喝一聲采，那樹叢，那樹叢上靑色的天，以及滿圓中澄澈的秋光把我的心洗了個凈，我自　着這不意的發現。走進去，蒼碧的扁葉　和洋搭桐凑成個幽靜的小道，夾着翡翠色的美人蕉，猩紅的楓，黝古的棕槶，成架的忍冬，沒有花的小銀杏，以及千奇百怪不可名狀的草木。小白蝴蝶兒在我面前飄，萬綠叢中有幾點絳紅及淺紫的逋峭的小秋花，迎着艷陽在鼓舞着歡忭的生命。這　是千月初，正是古詩人歌頌的「橙黃橘綠」的季節，而這圃中的橘樹，丹桂樹，也開始放射着迷人的芬芳了。除了留滯在鼻觀的香氣以外，這裏還有一種不可霄喻的，最細微的鄉村和半聲箱。大禽鳥啁啾與秋蟬的哀吟中，我寂寞地走進那荒池後的小徑，池面一層浮萍，幾個年輕的女子在作着油畫，我沒有驚動她們，因爲當前的景物引住了我。這時木葉微脱，我坐在一隅看這斑欄如古錦的秋，對一株奇形的樹木出神。於是蕭蕭的金雨降了下來，飄在我的髮上，襟上，地上，於是靜靜地躺在那裏，這使我想起「澗戶寂無人，紛紛自開落」的禪意的詩境，我沉入Adsetminded的狀態，突然間，我脖子邊颼地一響，猛地迴過頭來，遠了！嘿！一隻蜻蜓！</p>
<p>多恬逸，多享福，幾年來被工作壓扁的我，這眞是過分的賜予，就像唱一齣「花子拾金」。這苗圃在滬西的近郊，人父少，逃避了禮法，砸破了枷鎖，我躺在椅上向天發呆。仲秋的天空像景德鎭的細磁，淸一色地不留半點渣滓，渾圖地使人發生原始的崇敬，遠處學校鐘聲從寥廓的原野踱到我的身邊，一隻蒼鷹威武地但是無助地在我頭頂上打旋，我想飛，想離開這被殘殺，愚妄，和謊請所裝飾的人世。</p>
<p>看着天際的炊烟在裊繞，裊繞，我思想也隨着那個而　散開來。</p>
<p>我現在是處在地面，這地面有刺人的荊棘，但也有那止血的藥油，但是在「有意想不到之效力」的競賣廣告之下，使我們對許多藥劑都縐起我們懷疑的眉頭。一個偉大的人說過，沒有比我們生活着道時代再爲複雜的，我們負担着這一倫理的，美學的重担，只有勇敢的人纔負得起。在煩擾的現世紀的心胸裏，我也曾聽到一毬召喚，拿盧騷那種「返乎自然的仿單向我們說敎，話是不錯，對於生來就禀有一些幻想傾向的我，自然止是一個嬰兒的慈母，倦客的旅舍，但美麗往往是醜惡的本家，同是在地面上，眼看着萬物都欣欣向榮，而最可誇耀的人類却成羣結隊地往最黑晤的，最無恥的，最不合理的角落上走，這矛盾的對比豈非一個絕妙的荒唐！我見的「世面」太多，我所見的靑面獠牙臉譜使我說出極端憎恨人類的話。沒事的時候，我逃到曠野去找我的歡快。我看見靑色的天空，往往想到托爾斯泰大戰爭與和平中所寫的那個習於宴樂的公爵在戰塲上受了傷，躺在草地上看那秋天的蒼空：一多麼純凈！多麼　極，好像以前沒注意過……」好淸明的智慧！可惜這種智慧在他回到彼得堡紙醉余迷的交際塲中，就偷偷溜走了。</p>
<p>說到戰爭與和平，一個思想像　蜂似地螫了我一下，我們的整個民族—該說整個人類纔對—現在正處於戰爭與朴平的岐途上要用血的資本作一擲的孤住，賭一個未來的福運。我們當前的花香鳥語，顯然是一種苦丸外的糖衣，或竟是彈指即滅的蜃境逃也是不可能的，因爲白然的欣賞，詩興的遨游，戀情的啼笑這一切美的花朶都明明植根在社會的土床上。危邦之內，歌詠一下「三秋桂子，十里荷香」都會引起異族躍馬中原之思。在沒有文化城中名士修養的人，對於迎面而來的刺激，眞難有「泰山崩於前而色不變」之感。我現在是坐在椅上，我的手中是今天的報紙，那上面吿訴了我這錯綜複雜的萬花筒般的「世界的一日」，在這叢林鮮花括靜的小園之外，就有無　我們的兄弟在掙扎，在揮着汗做世們聖徒的工作，而我却帶着一居士的淡逸與犬儒的無關心，玩物喪志地徘徊於苗圃的一隅，讓歷史在自己身邊滑走過去，徒然想建起一憫理想的一華胥」，却也渭稽可悲，我還年輕，我要活，我要流動蓬勃的生氣，我不能像那個俄國小說中的靑年在沒喘息他最後一口氣時就說：「去吧！無用的生命」！</p>
<p>世界是可變　燦爛的伊甸樂園的，通過　骯髒的溝渠只有一道橋梁，這橋梁不是逃避，不是隱遁，而是撑起理想與信心的火炬，拔步向前，向前……</p>
<h3>夢</h3>
<p>— 杜撰</p>
<p>誰呀？敲着我的心扉，</p>
<p>你說，爲何默口不語？</p>
<p>大眼睛的人兒，</p>
<p>說呀，你呌什麼名字？</p>
<p>笑有什麼用處，</p>
<p>怪，我也沒把你得罪：</p>
<p>大眼睛的人兒，</p>
<p>你爲何纒繞着我不去？</p>
<p>前夜你就撓攪了我的睡夢，</p>
<p>昨宵你又依法泡製，</p>
<p>大眼睛的人兒，</p>
<p>請不要將我苦死！</p>
<h3>阿泡（註一）</h3>
<p>— 歐陽山</p>
<p>掘墳人丁祥躱在黑暗裏，心中跳躍不寗地要從他躱藏的屋角下衝出去，，以致兩雙脚不能直站——必須像野林中的猩猩似地彎曲着而且像碰到了緊張事情一樣在打抖。這是廣州一個不被人記憶的冬夜，很冷，白霜落在街道兩旁的瓦筒喳喳響着。街道筆直地通到東西兩個方向，人家都睡熟了，大門緊緊關閉，只在兩邊都距離六十尺以外有小小的店舖，燈光還從半掩的板門無力地射到地上，或濠渠的出水口——一個小小的魚塘般的平靜的水面上。</p>
<p>「SY——」他嘆了一口氣。四圍一點聲音都沒有，他在道里站？兩個鐘頭——似乎不曾引起裝出痴呆蠢相的屋宇和四處梭巡着的黑夜底注意。他把兩隻冷僵的手使力搓了幾下，輕輕駡道，「丟他老屎！」（註二）</p>
<p>遠遠有脚步聲走來……那個人底身影在店舖發出的燈光下閃了一閃又沒人黑晤——一塊無法攻入的寂靜的巨大黑鐵裏面去了。掘境人丁祥把捲烟踩滅，把頭上的破呢精除下，又牢牢地重新戴上、帽帶打結的地方揷着三根牙簽，好像太陽底光針一般。</p>
<p>「站住！」丁祥用嚴厲的聲呌喊。那個人剛剛走道……黑夜被　穿而發出迸裂的鳴響。</p>
<p>「動一動就打死的病比死的份兒多了，不許動」！</p>
<p>那是一個年紀在三十五左右的白白胖胖的頭腦冷靜的商人，沒有胆量而異常靈敏，池在他朋友底木器店裏用詐術騙取了老板和伙計們底七塊錢現金，正預備回家去吃一頓好滋味的消夜。</p>
<p>從第一聲吆喝起他知過自己不幸而碰到阿泡了，那一定是一個氣力大到足以殺死他，穿純色黑破短衣裳的脚色。別的辦法是沒有的，沒有警察而這里離家還很遠，也許那個混蛋還有手槍—劍仔……那是一定有的了……於是他聰明地裝做沒有聽見而一直向前走。</p>
<p>「要是　到」一個聾子，你總不能加害他」！商人在心裏想，他連旁邊都不望一望直向前走。</p>
<p>「也許他是一個講義氣的忘八，我告訴他我底耳子，現在害病……也許他是恐嚇我，試騐試騐我底胆量的呢，——但是沒有這件事，我就扯一個謊說我只有一塊錢，隨便他要不要，把一塊錢掏出來給他……」想到這里那商人再也想不下去了。</p>
<p>丁祥和他並排走着，把劍仔從襪帶裏拔出來，對手揮舞着，他彷彿在好玩地看着一條白蛆怎樣爬出牠底糞缸。</p>
<p>「你預備走到什麼地方呢」？</p>
<p>「你預備怎麼辦呢」？</p>
<p>「你底錢通通拿出來」！</p>
<p>「我沒有錢——」</p>
<p>「把你底棉袍除下來吧……」</p>
<p>「那麼冷——你太不近人情了」。</p>
<p>退伍傷兵黃權從黑暗裏彪了出來，他體格魁梧，好像一堵墻也被拖倒了似地橫檔住去路。</p>
<p>「爬開」！他對—祥說，把後者誤認做向親戚借一點錢的窮鬼了。「你身上的錢都拿給我！識相點」</p>
<p>黃權不認識丁祥，人先跑開來——隨後才開口討價，而且說「議相點」這樣的話……都足以證明黃權是一個不懂規矩的新道友。他窮到把他底劍仔也賣掉了，伸開兩隻關大的手掌鵝公似地兩邊拍動。</p>
<p>他們兩個人凶狠地扭住骼膊毆打起來了。丁祥是預先把劍仔塞進襪統裏，然後野豹似地向那高大的退伍塲兵衝過去的。商人在旁邊呆呆望着，緩緩走了開去。他因爲怕被發覺而不敢快步奔跑——假如這兩個全家剷（註三）覺醒並且同意平分他底所有——他想，那麼他這一回就死定了。</p>
<p>丁祥擊倒了那個退伍塲兵，帶着震怒的咆哮追上去，他們又臉對臉碰在一塊。丁祥渾身和暖異常，血脈像千萬條火蛇鑽通了一座樹林。跳躍地流動着，他現在失去了忍耐和賞玩的餘裕，要來自由處分他底獵獲物了。</p>
<p>「我眞是感謝你。簡直說不出多慶感謝。」</p>
<p>「爲什麼？」</p>
<p>「你是一個英雄——」商人把腰微灣一下。</p>
<p>「唔——」阿泡躊躇起來</p>
<p>「你從那惡鬼手裏把我救出來了，你——」</p>
<p>「胡說，我打他並不是爲了你！你再不住口我就殺死你，聽着！」</p>
<p>商人沉默了一會，提議把他身上所有的錢兩家平均，他們以後要常常做朋友，他或者還可以請他到自己店裏去當伙計。</p>
<p>「妄想！」阿泡丁祥敲打鐵器一般冷笑起來了，「把你身上的通通給我，我還嫌不够呢！」</p>
<p>那頭腦冷靜的不幸者在心裏咒駡，「死鬼！我頂多只能給你一半，隨便你吧。」但實際上他是把他底全部所有再加上嬴來的錢一共九塊錢一齊掏了出來。</p>
<p>丁祥接了銀紙——好像他接着燃燒的紅炭似地立刻把牠們丟在地上，紙幣在黑暗中沉落了。他强烈地感到恥辱。那刁滑的商人一定不會完全對他屈服的，假如他剛才不是那麼重重地打了那傷兵一頓。爲了使他屈服——他再沒有更好的威力了麼？他一定要擊倒那飢餓的人——他一定非那樣做不可麼？他暴怒起來了。</p>
<p>他開始去打那個不幸的被刦的人，他要用全力使那個人起來抗拒他，然後由他自己直接把他制服。他把那商人按在地上——那是一間大房屋底門口，鋪着很乎滑的士敏土地堂，笨重的厚木門嚴厲地關閉着恰像那家屋在一個世紀之內不曾有人住過，他舉起拳頭咚咚地敲那傢伙底胸膛和腦袋，拔出劍仔來恐嚇　：</p>
<p>「衰仔，打我呀！」</p>
<p>丁祥站起來抽着捲烟，烟頭的火光燒紅了整個黑夜，在朦朧的光綫照閃之下，那不幸的脚色匍匐在地上用疼痛的手拐去拾取那些散亂的鈔票。</p>
<p>註一　阿泡：無搶刦和偷竊的無業游民</p>
<p>註二　老屎：屁眼</p>
<p>註三　全家剷：全家都死光的人</p>
<h3>「江北人」</h3>
<p>— 靑霜</p>
<p>我故鄉旣毘連江岸，故與長江北岸的人，就發生了密切關係。雖然中間有一水之隔，來往只靠一種「義渡船」擺渡，須犯風濤之險，事實上不免起了一層隔閡的作用，但來往究竟還算便利，所以，由北岸而夾留居我故鄉城內城外一帶的所謂「江北人」，也就特別多了。</p>
<p>這些由北岸擺渡過來的「江北人」，也並非北岸沿江幾縣的人，而是再北去一點幾個縣分，如鹽城、興化、阜寗等地方的人。而且都是在本鄉窮到不易立足的破產農民。也因此，「江北人」三個字加在他們頭上，在儼然自以爲「江南人」的人眼中看來，自有其一種特別意義包含在內了。</p>
<p>在我家的附近，就住了不少此等「江北人」</p>
<p>他們的職業，大概是如下：男的：拉黃包車（運與上海黃包車夫差不多白分之九十爲江北人所包辦一樣，在我鄉亦然，本地人拉車倒反少，有之，拉有錢人包車之流而已），做苦力，逢有婚喪喜慶，爲人家奔步打雜等一切下等職務，間或有進工廠作工的，却不多。女的：爲人家帮傭，或是進廠作工，替人家洗滌衣服等。</p>
<p>他們的住宅，可置異常簡便而　時可以業成。那當然都是草屋，四周墻壁，用蘆席隔成。十幾支大竹，十幾頁蘆席，一二担稻柴，一日之間，就可搭成一間屋了（北實只能說是棚）。問有用泥十打成墻壁的，那還比較考究的了。草屋容易着火，因此常常鬧火災。我縣北門外，有一個大曠地，大家稱之曰蘆扉塲，因爲聚居在那個曠塲上的江北人，大都以編織蘆席爲業，以此得名。那裏住着的江北人，總不下一二百戶人家，草屋接二連三，望衡對宇，不着火則已，一家起火，就得燒個全塲。然後他們再來一决復興工作，不到幾月，一切皆復舊觀了。這一二十年來，前後也已不知燒過了多少决。</p>
<p>有一個夏天，我回到鄉下，住了幾個月。一向對他們不關心的江北人生活，我才看到了一點。</p>
<p>住在我家鄰近的那個江北人家，一夫一妻，年紀還都只三十出外，可是却已有了五個子女。男的職業是：帮人家打雜，無固定事務。今天那家有喜事，趕去帮忙一天，明天那家有喪事，再趕去帮忙一二天。無事就得閑逛。女的，已有這許多子女了，做工已不可能，只能撥出一些時間，替附近人家漿洗漿洗衣服，否則，便是代人家携送互相餽贈之禮物等。到自已半了小孩後的半年內，另外就又有了一個新職業：替人家做奶媽。可是也有一種本地有錢人家，並非小孩而是大人，據說人奶比牛奶還滋補，居然有請她去每早晨擠一盃奶汁，作爲補品吃的。代價大概每盃五分到一角之間，可記不大淸了。　孩子大了，吃飯和大人一樣，衣服也得多穿了，沉重的負担，就日漸向他們身上往下壓。沒法，只有呌十二三歲的大孩子去找工做。工是勉强的找到了（我鄉近有一個紗廠，算是本縣唯一的新式工業），但是一個月，二個月之後，大孩子病倒了。父母說是偷懶，做不來工，痛駡之外，還得鞭打。看看他們的無法維持這生活的情形之後，我們站在旁邊，也就不好意思說出口！不應該打小孩。反而，跑着也把小孩駡了。</p>
<p>丈夫有事可做時，看情形頗爲快樂，買三升米，切牛斤肉，到家欣欣然的燒來吃了，看來夫妻對坐，小孩搶着要肉吃，鬧成一片，旁邊人很稱贊他們有天倫之樂。他倆聽着，也嘻　嘴笑了。可是這情形並不能持久到三五天以上，丈夫酒又吃糊塗了，不算，把僅僅剩下的半塊錢，又去到賭場上輸了。</p>
<p>「該死啊！他又把我昨天替王家奶奶洗衣服賺來的半塊錢，拿去輸了，今夜夜飯也沒得吃了啊……</p>
<p>哭哭啼啼的聲音，又從草棚裏鑽出來，鑽到了街上。鄰人一致爲她抱不平說：</p>
<p>「小三子眞該死！糊塗貨！好沒良心」！</p>
<p>打架，吵駡，以及啼哭，當這些聲響從草棚裏傳到鄰居人的耳朶裏的時候，大家就知道：這二天小三子家日子又難過了。</p>
<p>小孩，整天在地上爬。泥土裏滿了一身，從頭到脚，看不出一塊皮肉是淸爽的。鼻涕整天抱出半寸朝外。於是有人就會嘅嘆的說道：</p>
<p>「究竟江北人下賤成性！你看這樣千，那裏像是一個人家的孩子」！</p>
<p>熱天到了、臭蟲，蚊蟲，集中了全力向他們進攻。帳子在他們中間當然不易現，唯一的防預武器是木屑製成的一種蚊烟條可是臭蟲却是永遠無法可以抵制的了。</p>
<p>明天一早晨，她就會紅腫了雙眼對我們說道：　「昨天一整夜沒睡」！</p>
<p>在小孩身上，我們發現了自頭到脚，全身是蚊疤和臭蟲疤，抓破的血痕像蜘網一樣</p>
<p>王家奶奶對她說：</p>
<p>「長生（大孩子名）娘，爲什麼不替小孩身上多洗洗呢，這滿身的骯髒」！</p>
<p>我們是輕易不會走淮他們棚裏去的。那裏而，烟氣，熱氣，霉爛氣，以種種氣味最複雜的調子交合成一種特有的臭氣，這氣味使你不能在裏　站立一分鐘。然而，這正是他們唯一的「家」。</p>
<p>自然，隣居人家，如王奶奶等，也時常以賙濟爲名，給他們一些破衣破鞋，以及吃剩了的東西，但有時還是餒的腐的。但她當接受到這些餽贈的禮品時，自然，感謝的言語，把這位王奶奶說時眉開眼笑了。</p>
<p>據我所知道的，留居於我家鄉城圈內外的江北人，他們的生活，大概比這一家好不了多少。</p>
<p>然而，他們究竟是「外鄉人」，何况，又是「江北人」？本地人和他們，雖同是黃面孔，說着同一的言語，不僅是同國，而且是同一個省分，只在中間隔了一條揚子江，把同一塊的土地，劃分作了「江南」與「江北」，再加上，他們都是在故鄉窮到難以立足的破產農民，被生活的脅迫驅送到外鄉來，此外，他們與我們自命為「江南人」者的中間，在任何方面並無什麼特異的差別。可是「江北人」三字，在我們「汀南人」看來，却另有一種特殊的涵養在內。細分析起來，大概是：貧窮·齷齪·愚眛等等的成份，而後被結晶成爲「江北人」一個名詞。在一般人的意識中，差不多已構成了這樣一僩圖式：江北人—就是一種最下等的人民，人家所不做的，他們都能做。</p>
<p>一二八戰爭起來了。在上海的閘北，發現了大批江北人被敵人利用作爲「漢奸」。他們沒有飯吃。自己不能事先好好組織他們成爲一支有力的抗敵軍隊，而委棄給了敵人，得到的懲罰是：「漢奸」！誰說不該殺呢？</p>
<p>由這事實的發現，於是跟着中國人很自然的邏輯，就順利的得到了如下的結論：凡是「江北人」，皆是「漢奸」！</p>
<p>公安局下了一道命令：</p>
<p>「凡留居本邑之江北人，限於一星期內，一律搬遷出境」。</p>
<p>當那家江北人家被逐出境時，她哭哭啼啼對我們說道：</p>
<p>「回去也是死啊」！</p>
<h3>登長安城</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>長安——這古老的城池，從前讀歷史的時候，時時在作着這樣的想：幾時能够到那座古城去觀觀光，該多麼有趣啊。這黃河流域的大城，歷代文化的中樞，雖然近幾百年以來把它冷淡下去，（從一二八以後，這城池彷彿又一天天被人注意起來了，）僅就瞻仰它的遺容這一點來說，也儘够賞識一下了。後來，雖說知道了現在的長安城已然不是漢代的長安，但那沒有關係，就是隋唐遺下的畏安城不是也儘够見識見識，開開眼界的麼。</p>
<p>這是從前的一種幻想，可是萬萬想不到，這幻想居然會成爲事實，我竟然從沉悶的北平城，大老遠的跑到長安城來。這一决的行旅旣然是出乎意外，同時又非常難得，自己眞有些不相信這是眞確的事實，因爲照我的預計來說，到長安觀光應該還要是冉過四五年才能實現的事情。</p>
<p>可是，我竟然登上長安城來觀賞城外的景色了。</p>
<p>爲了上城，我和同伴施很費了一些周折，我們以爲城門的近旁一定可以上得去，大老遠的奔到南鬥，郤碰了一個釘子，門旁邊恭恭正正寫着「禁止登城」的字樣，眼望着那古舊的城樓和城頭不免就引出無限的愁惱，我們的熱情一下子冷下一多半。</p>
<p>「怎麼辦呢，白白跑了一趟有多麼寃枉。」施不痛快地說。</p>
<p>「再去另尋別處罷，總還會有上得城的地方，不是前幾天我們還看見城上有人閑溜麼。」我接着說，「走，我們再往西去看看。」</p>
<p>其實我們的往西去看看這種决定，原是一個熟友在事前吿訴我們的，他說西邊有個可以上城的地方，不過胡同窄小，而且又非常骯髒，再緣別處能登城，還以不取此路爲妙。可是現在我們郤只有尋求這條骯髒的路徑了。我們離開南門，「直往西去，過了好幾條橫的胡同口，終於找到了那條骯髒的小路，果然，那里可以上到城上去。發現到這　髒的處所，我們兩個人高興極了，但一看兄那條小路上擺出來的幾具屁股，以及遍地皆是的大糞，嗅到薰天的臭氣時，則又不免覺得有些大煞風景。我們以急快的速度走過這段糞便的區域，就一直跑着登到城墻上去。</p>
<p>上城墻，有生以來還是第一次。故鄉雖然有城，因爲城身僅有二尺寬，自然上不去；托北平，我只登過「歷史博物館」旁邊一段紫禁城，那也不算數，所以這回要算是第一次的正式登城。小時候聽別人說北京城上可以並排走下兩三輛大車，那時很不相信，後來到了北平，一經登過紫禁城，也就相信這說法並非謊言，這番登上長安城，一看上面也可走上兩三輛大車，因此也就不覺着怎樣稀奇。</p>
<p>長安城周圍四十里，並算不得大城，但城墻整潔，倒很壯觀，大槪這要歸功於明淸的兩番修葺。以目前來論，比北平城新鮮，比北平城整齊。立時地使我想起來十七年圍城的慘事，那時候，聽說城里的人餓死的堆成無數的山，可是我在城墻上仔細觀察，郤看不出槍彈摧毀的殘跡。說不定就在立脚的垜口，從前架過機關槍，射死過無數攻城的同胞兄弟也未可知，現在長安城依然無恙，那些死難的人郤用自己的生命替別人造就出位高勳隆的領袖地位來，他們死的總算心有所慰吧？說起來中國的古城，差不多全經過一些兩軍攻守戰陣的慘刦的吧？</p>
<p>我同施放眼望將出去，但見終南山托出一團灰色，隱在南方露氣般的烟雲之下，冷眼看去，倒像楚一團團的浮雲；高原起伏，有如一重重的波浪，其間點綴着綠林，茅舍，沙石和燦爛的陽光，宛若一幅風景畫。風景路從南門衝出去，一直地鑽進眼界望不到的山凹里，灰灰的，好似一條長蛇，偶然有一兩輛來往的汽車，看去恰如爬行的螞蟻。聽說這條風景路，由什麼委員會經修，當眞化了好幾萬元。稍近些，大雁塔搖搖對立，從田野中一直仲到天空里去，活像兩枝門柱，蒼老的顏色正顯示着經過了長久的年代，不時地，在塔前塔後飛繞着鴉羣，晚上，道兩座塔大概就是牠們夜宿的良所。再近處，屈屈折折爬行着一條小火車道，那自然是運輸貨物用的，兩條鐵軌細細的恰如兩條蚯蚓，一直爬到城西去。磚窑上冒出的煤烟像一抹輕紗，展開來，又撤了去。再近處護城河乾乾的南岸，零零落落擺出一些洞子來，這是住人的地洞，有門框？也貼着有退了色的春聯，孩子們坐在洞外作着各種遊戲。這城外，畢竟有些荒凉，望出去，原野之上沒有多少房屋，僅僅是一個城墻的隔離，情形就全不一樣了。</p>
<p>我們反觀城里，房舍緊緊相速眞有如比櫛一般，一片呌囂聲也不是城外淸淸靜靜所可比並的。長安城里缺少高大的建築，除了鐘樓和鼓樓外，再有的只有少數城門樓了。所有的房了，望過去全是一般高低。土墻，瓦屋，儼如從一個模型里刻劃出來的，其問絕對沒有多大的差別。可是近來郤有幾家買買修起樓房來。</p>
<p>城頭上的風稍微大些，而當一個住慣都市的人整日生活在窄狹的街巷中，一經登城放寬了眼界四處眺望眺望，這實是最可人最難得的一件樂事。我們在城頭上溜着，原來城也到處不缺少糞堆，一個人能够天天到城頭上大便小便，說來這倒是痛快的事情，而當我們走到另一個垜口時，正看見兩個長袍漢子拉出屁股蹲下去了。大概，市政當局還沒有管到這地方的衛生來吧？</p>
<p>在城上瀏覽景物，確實可以使得胸懷舒暢，我登上長安城，就感到了道一點好處，對於這文化古都，郤不知怎樣追懷它的已往。</p>

<h3>欲「從」無由</h3>
<p>— 方克文</p>
<p>——『「奴隸」這種人類未曾存在之前、婦人已經是奴隸了』（倍倍爾語）</p>
<p>希特勒先生在卐字旗的飄揚下，是曾經大聲疾呼地喊過「婦女回家庭去」！的口號的，理由很多，除了養兒育女是婦女「神聖的天職」之外，據說因爲婦女跑到社會上來，搶去了男子的飯碗，於是便非趕同家庭去不可。在東方，則這樣的理論，抄一句國粹家們的說話，是也「古已有之」的，並且還更乾脆地訂下了「三從」的辦法：在家從父，嫁後從夫，夫死從子。這辦法想是再也週到不過的，較之搶去男子的飯碗什麼的那一套，也似乎光明爽直得多；它們就决計不　緊了喉嚨唱花旦，乾乾脆脆女人從出娘胎到老死，就應該「從男子」。</p>
<p>設想是週到的，幾千年來的女子也就「從」下去了。但問題却是還有的，假如欲「從」無由那又如何辦法呢？例如：</p>
<p>蘇州婦人嚴月英，妙齡時曾入娼鬥，因被富商劉××所賞識，旋卽量珠聘去，納爲小星，惟以大婦兇悍，因此劉與嚴卽遷往靑島別墅，且生有一子。數年前，劉逝世，嚴氏因被大婦威逼，乃祗得下堂，子爲劉之大婦領回收養。現該子年已長成，且又分得劉之遺產。但其親生母嚴氏以下堂後，並未嫁人，致生活艱難，乃一度向親生子要求確認母子關係，奈該子爲承襲劉氏財產條件所限，遽竟否認，因此母子兩人，曾兩次涉訟於法院。日前嚴氏曾親往子家，請其顧念母子之情，給予贍養，不意該子非但不認，且將嚴氏驅諸門外，辱駡一塲，嚴氏返家後，痛恨難堪，竟背人呑服毒藥圖盡，：</p>
<p>這樣欲「從」無由的事，當然不是從嚴氏才開始，但這却是一個很好的例我們從這機的例子中，可以明明白白的知道：卽使肯安安靜靜的想做「奴隸」，也是不易做的，這之間還分着等級。</p>
<p>至於可以「從」的呢，照理是應該「從」下去了，但也是危險得很，就算是肯死心地「從」吧，丈夫變心的事也是極普遍的，到那時也許也會欲「從」無由。於是進步些的便主張男女平等，要求女子從廚房專解放出來，要求婦女與男子同樣有敎育均等的機會，甚至，要求婦女參政，要求一切公共事業都有婦女參加。</p>
<p>這進步自然是可喜的，但也祗此爲止。這樣的結果，是有幾個要人太太是參政了，有幾個名人太太是也主持婦女什麼會或是什麼婦女會了，有幾個資產者的女兒也進了什麼大學或是鍍金去了，至於大部份的婦女呢？依舊如此。依舊生活在泥沼裏，依舊在「婦人的性的奴隸制度，和妻子的經濟的依賴主義裏打滾。</p>
<p>「婦人的大多數，對於在社會上比較的幸福的數千的同性，受高等敎育，就高級職業，都是和她們自身沒有關係的問題。數千幸福的婦女的地位改善，是决不能改善婦人全體的一般狀態的。」我想我祗有再抄倍倍爾的話來作這篇短文的結束。至於那位嚴氏除了「服毒圖盡之外再有什麼路呢？我不想指出來。但第一，如果想生存下去，「從」的迷夢必須打破那是必要的。</p>
<h3>美國大總統的養尊處優</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>英國首相鮑爾溫的年俸，縱使由五千鎊增至八千鎊，但是比較羅斯福的年俸，還低得多哩，羅氏今年五十四歲，現又聯任美國大總統了。他的年俸，折合英金，是一萬五千鎊。</p>
<p>美總統比英首相還佔一個優點，那便是華盛頓壯麗的白宮，完全由政府維持，總統所用的汽車，藥品，和僕役的工資，都是由政府付的。鮑爾溫郤須在唐寗街十號每年花費一千鎊，他的私人秘書，汽車夫，僕役的薪金，也須自己挖腰包的。</p>
<p>美國國會每年在預算案中規定白宮經費二萬八千六百五十鎊，包括修理，裝飾，煖氣，電燈等費。唐寗街十號的修理，歸公共工程部擔任，每年只花費幾百鎊。</p>
<p>美總統享用的事物，歸政府出費的，還有下列諸項：</p>
<p>每年旅行費五千鎊，還常備花車一列，聽他乘用，甚至洗衣費也歸國家擔任，每年總在一千鎊以上，白宮的汽車處維持費，幾及總統的年俸。共有汽車夫十二人，他們的工資共計三千五百鎊，他們的制服，共計須用五百鎊，至於汽車，每年須費七千鎊。</p>
<p>總統患病或牙痛，請醫診治，都不出費。白宮雖駐有醫官一員，但總統所一需的看護，藥品，和醫院用品，都能免一費享用。甚至治病的器具，也可隨意用</p>
<p>總統旅行和住旅館，從來不着帳單，甚至小帳，也歸國家照付。</p>
<p>總統有一私用的整容處，每晨必往整容，整容師的工資，和所用的肥皂，潤膚粉，都歸政府擔在。</p>
<p>總統晨餐案上，常置瓶花，每天送白宮的剪枝花，總在七百朵左右。政府每年以五百鎊付總園丁的工資，此外還有普通園丁一大批。總統遇宴會需花的時候，用印就的卡片，開明花名，命園丁照送，那卡片的印費，也是公欵。</p>
<p>總統所閱的報紙，書籍，雜誌，都由政府供給。</p>
<p>總統有一隻遊船，名波吐瑪克號，共用船員三十人，每年需費一二萬鎊。僅羅總統在船上吃的食品，可以自己付費，他還能向海軍調用戰艦一艘，或向陸軍調用戰馬若干匹。</p>
<p>白宮臥室二十一間，健身房一間，游泳池一所。廣塲上有構製奇異的玻璃花房一所，值價五百萬磅。若是一個公民住在裏面，享受這種生活，每年須繳稅七萬七千五百六十一磅。</p>
<p>總統會晤國務員的內閣室，近曾大加修改。大總統坐在長案的盡端，對面盡端便是副總統迦納的坐席。在羅斯福做大總統以前，副總統在內閣室是沒有坐位的，羅斯福接任後，便史改舊章，也很優待忠心盡職的人員，他禮遇副總統，可以表示其一斑。</p>
<p>羅總統雖然如此養尊處優，但起居依然質樸，每晨八時起身稍進晨餐，便閱晨報。十時三十分到十二時，接見國務員等，會談政務，每日上午接見的人大槪在十五入至二十人之間。十二時進午餐，吃的是湯，生菜，咖啡。於是會商政務，但午後大都從事批閱文牘，處理立法事件，薄暮，游泳片刻，那游泳池是專爲他造的。晚餐後，常退居私室，草擬他的演說稿。他的消遣很簡單，他有一問私用電影室，每星期放映兩次，他最愛看米克基茅烏斯的影片。他最愛吃的餐點，是蛋花，每逢星期日的晚上，他夫人必親手烹調，這已成了三十年來夫婦快樂牛活中的一個慣例。</p>
<h3>在豐台</h3>
<p>— 用臧</p>
<p>到豐台時，已經晌午了。在縱橫雜亂的鐵軌中，我簡直分不出那一條是從失去的土地，穿過天下第一關而歸來祖國懷抱裏的北寗路，那一條是從荒凉的西北，爬山越嶺而來的平綏路，那一條是從中國腹地，跨過長江黃河兩大流域而來的平漢路，因爲這三條鐵路都會合在豐台，使這一個數十年前僅是一個京城外的荒村，變成了今日在華北無比的重鎭了。</p>
<p>在離車站南邊一里的地方，屹立着××兵營，雖然是一問間的木屋，却也嶄新而堅固，中央的高桿上，飄揚着紅血色的太陽旗。</p>
<p>大街的轉角處，傳來一片雜亂的呼聲，××御料理門前，兩個高麗棒子和一個中國人在撕打着，那個二十多歲的中國漢子，衣裳給撕破了，頭髮蓬鬆着漲紅着臉，二個高麗人把他打倒地上，那人還在拚命的掙扎，高喊着：</p>
<p>「你他媽的毀人精，我就不許你住我的屋子，你憑麼不給房租？高麗捧子，你滾蛋，媽的狗仗人勢」！</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>「巴格，再往兩年給你」！</p>
<p>一個四十多歲有黑叢一下馬鬍子的高麗人邊駡着，還用大的皮靴踢那個人。</p>
<p>到我往那個合順客棧去吃飯的時候，這事情結東了，不幸生爲中國人的那房東，被抓進××警察署裏去，我把自行車推到窗戶底下跟店小二說：</p>
<p>「眞巧，說到這兒來啾啾，剛巧碰見這些事」！</p>
<p>「一點也不算巧，這些事每天都有，昨天三個高麗把街西頭的高老五痛打了一頓，撒尿都出血，還不知死活呢」。</p>
<p>胖廚子用圍巾揩了揩手，搖着腦袋說：</p>
<p>「唉，更苦的在後頭呢，打關外回來的說家裏有修脚刀都犯法……」他帶有痰的聲音裏，表示着無限感傷，他預感着未來亡國奴的悲慘命運。</p>
<p>五點左右，太陽斜向西出了，整個豐台沉在灰黯中，街市是平靜而荒凉，寒風掃過原野來，遠處傳來幾聲奇異的號音，那個畫着紅點子的旗在高桿上慢慢向下降落，我望着那蒼茫的遠方，禁不住心頭泛起一股無法壓抑的悲憤。</p>
<h3>麻雀</h3>
<p>— 佳</p>
<p>今年夏天，從親戚家分來一些荷花秧，其實就是藕；不過沒有買來吃的那樣鮮嫩，而又細小。但是它是明年荷花的母本，人們就呌它做秧了。</p>
<p>家裏人都沒有種荷花的經騐，雖然一切遵照親戚吩咐的種植法：請人挑了河泥，下了肥料，可是在人家缸裏結了蓮子的時候，我們的荷葉還像金錢那末大小，花苞一個也沒有。一團高興，化爲烏有。而且沒有開花結實的秧，到明年也要換新的，否則就永世看不到一朶出於污泥而不染的君子花了。</p>
<p>到翻缸的時候，果然發現那藕節已經完全爛了。母親懷疑肥料太多。像病人的虛不受補，活活地送死了。</p>
<p>不過這次失敗對於我一點沒有損失，我並不愛好花。而由於那缸沒有開花的荷花，却招來了一羣麻雀，那羣麻雀是呌做「十姊妹」的。這種披麻衣的小動物反是我在鳥類之中所愛好的一種。愛鳥而癖愛麻雀，聽來或許是個笑話，不過我的理也由是十分充足的：我反對每天的時間都耗費在一件自己愛好的東西身上，而普通的一般養鳥者，都是「鞠躬盡悴，死而後已」的爲鳥効忠。那不是愛鳥，而是鳥的奴隸了。我的朋友之中就有終日離不開鳥的奴隸，他們好像爲鳥而生存着的。我就反對「有鳥沒有人」的愛鳥法，但是一個並不愛好花朶的人却偏偏喜歡鳥的，那有什麼辦法呢，因之愛上了麻雀。</p>
<p>麻雀是不必費心費力地捕在金絲籠裏的。卽使偶然高興，捕它幾個來關在籠子裏，也不必費心費力地爲它打算，祇要每天放些食，換一孟淸水，它們就自由自然地生活了。不像那些——我就呌不出那末多的名稱來，一個侍奉不週，就肚子向天，仰臥在籠子裏了。</p>
<p>麻雀似乎到處可以看見，但是你癖愛了麻雀之後，却很少看見它們活動了。它們喜歡宿在荒塔的頂上，枯廟的屋春，或者有別的鳥類所棄遺的敗窠中。我家不是廟，近處又沒有塔，別的鳥類也很少見、於是這種隨處可見的麻雀也似乎珍貴起來。那缸沒有開花的荷花却不知有什麼魅力招來了一羣「十姊妹」。</p>
<p>說是「十姊妹」矯却不一定是十個，總之是一羣。照普通習慣，「三」已能代表多數，「十」自然可以代表羣了。它們就那樣一羣一羣的飛來，起初是含羞地躱在牆角上，彷彿商議着它們是否可以下去，看那浮着綠葉的缸裏似乎有很豐滿的食料的。於是一隻，就一定是首領，冒險地從牆角上翻身下來，掠過撑着缸口的鋼絲架，在缸邊上站定了，啄着水面的遊蟲，愉快地抖着麻衣，啁啁啾啾招呼它的部下了。</p>
<p>從此，那荷花缸是它們的殖民地了，毫無畏懼地在缸邊上演習，其來也速，其去也速，我至今捉摸不定它們的營壘紮在什麼地方。不過在附近已有安樂窩是一定的，如今荷花秧已爛了，它們還是一天來幾回，在牆角上徘徊。</p>
<p>我曾想過，把它捕來玩幾天。明年再向親戚家去分秧來種幾缸荷花。</p>
<p>我家的老媽子却最恨「十姊妹」，因爲它們在晒衣裳的天井裏撤糞，於是荷花不結蓮子也遷怒到它們身上，說是啄壞了嫩秧所致。老媽子天天在盼望下雪，下雪天看它們一個個凍死，而且已經製了個捕鳥的籠單，預備捉來做下酒物。</p>
<p>我想捕捉它們的心願更堅决了，我要捕它們來養過一個冬天。</p>

<h3>Chiang's Kidnapping Was Likely Orchestrated by the Soviet Union - Views from the Vatican's Official Newspaper</h3>
<p>Vatican: A telegram from the Vatican: The Vatican's official newspaper, "L'Osservatore Romano," recently published an article commenting on the Xi'an Incident in Shaanxi Province, China, stating: "The kidnapping of Chinese President Chiang Kai-shek by mutinous soldiers was likely orchestrated by the Soviet Union. Zhang Xueliang's purpose in rebelling is clearly to shift Japan's actions from Russia to China. This alone is enough to prove that this rebellion was influenced by the Soviet Union. Previously, Russia attempted to incite Outer Mongolia to invade Inner Mongolia. After this policy failed, Russia again sought to incite Chinese nationalism. Zhang Xueliang's rebellion arose from this, and the result may lead to Japanese intervention." (Havas News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>

(Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Committee decided on the 16th to send Yu Youren to comfort the military and civilians in the Northwest. Yu believes that the comforting of the military and civilians in the Northwest is of utmost urgency after the rebellion in Xi'an occurred. At 4:00 PM on the 17th, he received the order to go west.

However, to facilitate the comforting work, he plans to set up an agency similar to an embassy in Luoyang to oversee everything.</p>
<p>Written Statement</p>
<p>Before his departure, Yu released a written statement saying, "When I heard about the Xi'an Rebellion, I felt that the crisis of our country and nation had suddenly become more serious. President Chiang's work to revive China, which he has led through countless difficulties, has suffered a setback, and the life of our entire country and nation has been struck a blow. At this time, the hearts of the people throughout the country are filled with extreme grief and anger, and they have a clearer understanding of the revolutionary journey and their own responsibilities. Consolidating the political situation, suppressing the rebellion, and rescuing the leader's safety and freedom are the unanimous determination and task of our entire country at present. We should devote our utmost efforts to this cause. Moreover, the generals, children, and people of the Northeast, after losing their provinces and homes, and the generals, children, and people of the Northwest, after more than ten years of war and turmoil, on the one hand, are displaced children, and on the other hand, are bereaved people. How can we sit idly by and watch them be devastated by the threats of rebellion? The central government has sent me to the Northwest to comfort them. I will naturally take the central government's heart as my own, hoping that the unanimous awareness and efforts of the military and civilians will save us from hardship and enable our country and nation to be revived under the leadership of our leader."</p>
<p>Telegram to Zhang and Yang</p>
<p>He also sent a telegram to Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng, saying: (1) To Mr. Zhang Hanqing and Director Yang Hucheng of Xi'an: Since President Chiang lost his freedom, not only has the public been shocked and angry, but the opinions of countries around the world have regretted that China's revival cause has suffered a setback. Soviet Russian newspapers are even more agitated, believing that damaging China's strength to resist the enemy will only give aggressors an excuse. Today's events not only put you in a dangerous city but also put the entire country in a dangerous city. I hope you will think thrice. The central government has ordered me to enter Shaanxi, because I think that the generals and children of the Northeast and Northwest are all like flesh and blood, which makes me feel endless sorrow, and the people of the Northwest, who have just had a chance to live, must feel even more pitiable at this time. I will do everything in my power to avoid war, but this depends on your compassionate change of heart. At this time of extreme national crisis, there is also an extremely easy way out. I hope you will think thrice. The safety and freedom of President Chiang and all the generals and colleagues are the safety and freedom of the generals, children, and people of the Northeast and Northwest, and the safety and freedom of our country and nation. This depends on your great wisdom and courage. The customs and seas are far apart, but I communicate my sincerity. I hope you will consider my words. Yu Youren. (2) To Mr. Zhang Hanqing and Director Yang Hucheng of Xi'an: I have read the telegram. Voices opposing you have filled the world. Now a major mistake has been made, and great disaster is looming, but the awakening of great benevolence and great courage is also at this time. I am ordered to enter Guanzhong. I hope you will send someone to see me and explain everything in detail. Yu Youren, (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Various Organizations in Beijing Support the Suppression; Student Letter to the Nation from Major Universities and Secondary Schools in the Capital</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Beijing Municipal Party Department, as well as the Beijing Municipal Agricultural, Industrial, Commercial, Academic, and Women's organizations, etc., telegraphed the entire nation on the 17th to support the Central Government's suppression of the rebellious Zhang Xueliang. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) All students of major universities and secondary schools in the capital recently issued a public letter to fellow students nationwide, the original text of which is as follows: "Since the outbreak of national crisis, the entire nation has been clamoring, but empty words are of no help. Only Chairman Chiang has maintained a spirit of unwavering determination, gritting his teeth to struggle for the country. With less than five years of recuperation and training, he has brought about astonishing development in the nation's spirit and material construction. As of today, the nation has declared unification, with foreign powers praising each other, diplomatic expressions showing an orderly array, and national defense achieving unprecedented victory. Yet Zhang Xueliang suddenly rebelled in Xi'an, abducting the commander-in-chief who had just returned from inspecting the front lines and who was leading the nation's soldiers in struggling for the country, and detaining loyal and brave generals who were actually directing operations on the front lines, attempting to destroy with one fell swoop the only hope for national revival. Anyone with blood in their veins, who wouldn't feel sorrow and indignation? An individual who has always advocated non-resistance is now clamoring for revenge; soldiers who are unable to fight are now freely discussing the recovery of lost territories; using the fallacy of a united front to undermine the only current force for unity against foreign aggression. Facts speak louder than words; how can the people of the nation be completely deceived? According to a special dispatch from the Ta Kung Pao in Pingdi Spring, 'When news of the Xi'an Incident reached the soldiers on the front lines in eastern Suiyuan, it was like a bolt from the blue. They couldn't help but stroke their swords and lament, carry their rifles and sigh. Looking eastward towards Changbai Mountain and turning their heads towards Zhongnan Mountain, all were sobbing and shedding tears.' Can the blood and tears of the soldiers on the front lines not pierce the conscience of the traitorous bandits? How can they not ignite the indignation of our compatriots nationwide? We implore all young comrades throughout the nation to prioritize the nation and the state, clarify the location of right and wrong, truth and falsehood, sweep away fallacies that subvert the government and split the nation's strength, and with a solemn and resolute spirit and conviction, pledge to be Chairman Chiang's rear support, uphold the Nationalist Government that is uniformly recognized at home and abroad as representing the Republic of China and striving for national survival, continue to implement national policies, and overcome crises. The human spirit is immortal, and justice still exists. With this spirit and sincerity, we are duty-bound and will not hesitate. We respectfully offer this statement to fellow students and compatriots nationwide."

<h3>The Heroic Souls Under Daqing Mountain</h3>
<p>—Zong Liangdong</p>
<p>—Memorial Ceremony for Soldiers Who Died in the Suiyuan War—</p>
<p>It was a clear morning. Although the weather was cold, there was no wind or dust. In the border region, under Daqing Mountain, everyone, with a feeling of excited mourning, went to participate in this public memorial ceremony for the soldiers who died gloriously for the nation.</p>
<p>The glorious victory in this Suiyuan War is a sign of our national revival. We should joyfully strengthen our confidence. But for those soldiers and officers who have already sacrificed themselves for the country, we should express the utmost respect for their loyal souls who fought bravely against the enemy and were determined to achieve benevolence. Therefore, the "Public Memorial Ceremony for Soldiers Who Died in Battle" held by the General Headquarters for the Suppression of Bandits in Jin and Sui has a profound significance.</p>
<p>The location of the public memorial ceremony was the Martyrs' Park, three miles north of Suiyuan City. Speaking of the history of the Martyrs' Park, it evokes endless grief in us. It was established for the soldiers of the 35th Army who died in the Battle of the Great Wall. We can still find traces of the heroic history of resisting the enemy and a lot of loyal and indignant souls on the Martyrs' Monument. Before the blood of our martyrs had dried, the enemy came to invade us again. But our loyal and brave soldiers, following the military's duty to defend the country, bravely resisted the enemy, repeatedly achieving great feats in eastern and northern Suiyuan. Following Hongge'ertu, they also recovered Bailing Temple. That glorious victory was indeed rare in the context of national crisis over the past five years. But the cornerstone of this victory was bought with the blood and flesh of countless soldiers. In commemorating this victory, we must also commemorate those loyal soldiers who died in battle.</p>
<p>Among the soldiers who died in battle this time, there were eighty or ninety officers below the rank of company commander, and the number of soldiers was about ten times that. However, only forty-odd caskets have been transported back. The mourning hall for the public memorial ceremony was set up behind the Martyrs' Memorial Hall, inside which were placed the caskets of more than forty soldiers. The front was piled with wreaths. In the center was a memorial platform with sacrificial offerings such as whole cattle, whole pigs, whole sheep, pastries, and fruit. Incense, candles, and paper money were used to pay tribute to the loyal souls. The scene was very solemn and tragic. The front of the mourning hall was decorated with white cloth and colorful balls. In the middle was a eulogy sent by Chairman Lin of the National Government, Chairman Chiang, the head of the cabinet, and others. On both sides were eulogistic couplets from various officers, agencies, and organizations. Burial grounds had been dug on the east and west sides of the mourning hall. They sacrificed for the country and sought the survival of the nation. They should have died a worthy death and have no regrets in the afterlife. However, the responsibility of this large group of us who survived has become even heavier!</p>
<p>Many groups came to participate in the public memorial ceremony, including personnel above the rank of lieutenant in the direct subordinate brigade of the 25th Army, officers and soldiers of the Gendarmerie Headquarters, anti-communist corps training teams, the various teams of the cadre training center, the various departments and bureaus of the provincial government, the Mongolian Political Council in Suiyuan, the headquarters of the Mongolian banner bandit suppression, various secondary schools, newspaper offices, people's organizations, as well as student representatives from Xi'an and Tianjin, totaling about three thousand people. Every soldier or people's representative who participated in the public memorial ceremony showed a painful feeling of grief on their faces, but at the same time, they also carried a resolute determination. We admire, we mourn, and we also strive forward.</p>
<p>At half-past ten, Fu Xiyi and others led all the representatives in the public memorial ceremony. The ceremony was simple, solemn, and solemn. After the public memorial ceremony, Chairman Fu gave a eulogy. Despite the hectic circumstances of the Suiyuan War, he was still very courageous in spirit, and his face showed deep pain. In his words, we could see his loyalty to the nation and the country and his sincerity to the soldiers and officers. The general idea was:</p>
<p>"This public memorial ceremony for the soldiers who died in battle is of profound significance. Although the enemy's military equipment is sophisticated, they can never defeat the loyalty and patriotic indignation of our soldiers. For the sake of the survival of the nation, for the sake of justice and peace, we fought against the enemy and wiped out the bandit puppet army, finally winning victory. From this, we can know that as long as the whole country is united, has determination and strength, the national crisis can be eliminated. The soldiers who died in battle this time made a glorious and extraordinary contribution in the nation's war of resistance against the enemy. Today, we come to the public memorial ceremony and should inherit their heroic spirit and legacy, and permanently defend ourselves and resist the enemy for the survival of the nation and the country——"</p>
<p>Chairman Fu once had the famous saying "Don't say harsh words, don't do soft things," which shows his determination and strength to defend himself and resist the enemy. He would never just pay lip service. It is very clear to us when we cite the facts of this victory in the Suiyuan War and his words today.</p>
<p>Next, Liu Ruiheng, Director of the Central Health Administration, Liu Guanxun, member of the Legislative Yuan, student representatives from Xi'an and Tianjin, and representatives from the Jin-Cha-Sui Brigade to Pingyuan for the Suiyuan Relief Effort delivered eulogies. Everyone was full of grief and indignation, and lamented generously, while also placing unlimited hopes. The soldiers who died in battle this time truly died gloriously. They sacrificed themselves to defend the territory, and the territory has returned to completeness and security. They sacrificed themselves for national survival, and the nation has consolidated its cornerstone because of it.</p>
<p>After the public memorial ceremony, Chairman Fu and others went to the spiritual forecourt to visit the loyal caskets, and tears of sorrow and indignation fell from their eyes. Next, the families, wives, and children of the soldiers who died in battle came to pay their respects, burn paper money. The west wind blew the ashes of the paper money, flying around in the mourning hall. The candles were shining brightly, as if seeing hope in the midst of sorrow. That kind of hope is what the soldiers who died in battle entrusted to the shoulders of each of our people.</p>
<p>The heroic souls under Daqing Mountain, on this clear day, will forever be in our minds, forever in our actions, with a glorious victory. (Suiyuan, 11th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Believes No Need to Take Steps to Protect Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>(Washington) State Department officials stated today that the current situation in China does not require the United States to take steps to protect the lives and property of American overseas Chinese. The Xi'an Incident is still unclear. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<h3>New York Times Comments on the Shaanxi Incident</h3>
<p>(New York) Regarding the incident in Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province, China, local newspapers have published lengthy reports from correspondents in Shanghai and Nanjing, and many have published editorials. Among them, the New York Times stated, "Although General Chiang Kai-shek has lost his freedom, the Chinese political situation is still under his control. The whole world was shocked to hear the news, which shows that the whole world recognizes Chiang as the greatest leader in China and automatically respects him. It is difficult to believe that Japan wants to destroy Chiang. There is no evidence to support the theory of Soviet conspiracy. Therefore, the dispute between Japan and the Soviet Union can be expected to be avoided." (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Director Kong Gives a Broadcast Speech Last Night on the Serious Situation Caused by the Xi'an Incident</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Acting President of the Executive Yuan Kong Xiangxi gave a speech on the radio station at 8:40 PM on the 17th, detailing the serious situation caused by the Xi'an Incident. The original text is recorded as follows: "Fellow compatriots throughout the nation, today the Central Radio Station invited me to give a speech. The entire nation is indignant about the Xi'an Incident, and I am no exception. Now, I will try to suppress my grief and speak calmly and rationally about the relationship between this incident and the country. The Xi'an Incident has occurred for several days now. The news of this incident has spread, and not only the people throughout our country are united in anger, but also countries all over the world are shocked and worried, because President Chiang is our only leader in China. In the past few years, he has known only the nation and not himself, leading the country to survive through hardships. The banditry has been gradually suppressed, and various constructions have gradually flourished. National defense, public training, and financial consolidation have all had a considerable foundation. From a chaotic country, it has been transformed into a unified country. It took so many sacrifices to have the spirit of self-reliance, unity, and resistance to foreign aggression that we have now. The future of the country has already had the hope of revival. All of this was forged by President Chiang's arduous and unremitting efforts. President Chiang himself is the savior of our country. Harming President Chiang is harming our Chinese nation. The relationship is so important, especially when we are suffering from so many foreign troubles. We rely on President Chiang to lead the entire nation to work hard and struggle. I never expected that the rebellious generals Zhang Xueliang, Yang Hucheng, etc., would dare to kidnap President Chiang, at the cost of destroying the country and plunging the nation into a bottomless abyss. This kind of act of rebellion and treason cannot be forgiven under national law. The National Government, following the broad teachings of the late President Sun Yat-sen and President Chiang's tolerance, first dismissed them from their posts, and the Military Affairs Commission investigated them. Unexpectedly, for several days, there has been no definite expression of repentance. And yesterday, according to a report from the troops stationed in Huayin, they are concentrating their troops near Weinan and Xi'an on the one hand, and attacking the garrison troops in Huayin on the other hand. Military and civilian officials of various provinces, as well as generals at all levels, have requested to join the battle. The world's public opinion has also expressed indignation, denouncing them as political thieves. Even the Soviet newspapers have said that the demands they made are just a smokescreen for the launch, and the actual destruction of China's external resistance, etc. On the other hand, they have unanimously praised and expressed admiration for President Chiang's achievements. It can be seen that the rebellion in Xi'an is intolerable to the world. They thought that kidnapping the leader could be used as a tool for coercion, but they did not know that our country now has doctrines, and the government is well-organized and has a consistent national policy. It will definitely implement the policies decided by the central government under the guidance of the central government, and cannot be compromised due to a temporary incident. Moreover, President Chiang has dedicated himself to the revolution for thirty years, has experienced hundreds of battles, and has gone through countless dangers and difficulties. He has long placed life and death aside and has a spirit of great fearlessness. They want to follow the old tricks of the arrogant and fierce generals of the warlord era and use this to overthrow the government, but they will only find their efforts wasted. Now that the facts of claiming military resistance have become clear, in order to quickly quell the incident, the National Government has no choice but to take decisive measures. Yesterday, it complied with public opinion and ordered the suppression. We must know that every country has several necessary creeds. First, right and wrong must be clear. Second, obedience and rebellion must be distinguished. Third, discipline must be rectified. Fourth, unity must be maintained. Fifth, morality must be observed. Sixth, national strength must be concentrated. This kind of kidnapping of the leader, undermining the superiors, destroying the discipline of the country, dispersing the strength of the nation, and destroying the unity of the whole country is unforgivable. Moreover, they have all been deeply favored by President Chiang, who has treated them with sincerity and frankness on a daily basis, but they have used deceitful means to kidnap President Chiang. Where is human faith? President Sun Yat-sen's teachings advocated restoring inherent morality and taking loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace as the foundation of the country. The New Life Movement takes propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame as its guidelines. They simply despise propriety and betray righteousness, and are shameless. The central government is now explicitly ordering the suppression, which is to clarify right and wrong, distinguish obedience and rebellion, and rectify discipline. The ancients said, 'A righteous army is strong,' and 'Those who act unrighteously will destroy themselves,' and 'What all men point at will die even without sickness.' It is expected that there must be people within them who are deeply aware of righteousness, who can distinguish obedience and rebellion, set things right, and abandon darkness to embrace the light. In any case, the central government will be able to quell the Shaanxi Incident in the shortest possible time. I hope that all compatriots throughout the country will rise up together, condemn and denounce, and support the government to quickly quell the rebellion. As for President Chiang, although he is now being held captive by them, according to reliable reports, he is extremely comfortable in Shaanxi. The central government has always had a consistent policy for both domestic and foreign affairs. Although President Chiang has temporarily lost his freedom, the colleagues of the central government will continue to proceed in accordance with the established national policy. All of us in the country should work together as one, just as when President Chiang personally led us, and we will definitely win the final victory. This incident came suddenly. The authorities of all provinces and cities have wholeheartedly supported the central government and stabilized society. After being indignant, compatriots across the country can still abide by order, so that the government can calmly respond. This spirit is enough to show the unity of all of us in the country, and it is also enough to show the great power of the united strength of all of us in the country. I and my colleagues in the central government are all deeply moved and comforted." (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>

The incident is strange and the whole country is shocked. Our Commander-in-Chief is loyal to the country and a leader among men. All who share this world sincerely love and support him. At this time of urgent diplomacy and national survival, how can we allow such a rebellion to endanger the foundation of the country? We urge everyone to denounce this act so that our Commander-in-Chief can return to Nanjing as soon as possible to stabilize the country. At the same time, punish the rebels and appease public anger.

We urge you to remember the national humiliation that needs to be avenged, the fatherly hatred that has not been repaid, and Chairman Chiang's past kindness. Escort him back to Nanjing in the coming days, submit yourself to punishment, and the people of the country will still forgive you.

<h3>Establishment of the American Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>The Pan-American Peace Conference has been open since the first of this month, and more than half a month has passed. During these two weeks of meetings, twenty-one countries of the Americas gathered together, and the atmosphere has always been very harmonious. On the 13th, an American Peace Treaty was agreed upon and signed by representatives of various countries, and unanimously approved by the plenary session on the 15th. At the same time, the Mexican representative submitted a new peace plan, advocating the adjustment of existing peace plans into one, and the establishment of an American court, etc. If this proposal is approved in the future, it will certainly have significant achievements. Here, I would like to express my views on the American Peace Treaty.</p>
<p>The content of the American Peace Treaty is quite simple, with only two articles and one protocol. The articles stipulate that when American peace is threatened, or when war breaks out between American countries, the governments of the American countries should immediately discuss a plan for peaceful cooperation and confirm the obligations stipulated in the Anti-War Pact and the Lamas Treaty (i.e., the American Treaty of Conciliation and Non-Aggression, drafted by Argentine Foreign Minister Lamas, hence the name). From the wording of these articles, it seems that there is no significant meaning. In fact, it is not the case. First, historically speaking, the responsibility for maintaining American peace was previously placed entirely on the United States. This means that American affairs were entirely at the beck and call of the United States. Now, the new treaty clearly stipulates that American peace should be maintained jointly by all American countries, and cannot be handled solely by the United States. This indicates that smaller American countries will also have the same speaking rights as the United States in future international disputes. Second, although the articles of the American Peace Treaty are very simple, they contain the obligations of the Anti-War Pact and the Lamas Treaty. The Anti-War Pact stipulates that war should not be used as an instrument of national policy. The Lamas Treaty further stipulates the prohibition of aggressive war and the non-recognition of territory acquired by force. If these regulations are violated, the contracting states should unanimously use all political, economic, and legal methods permitted by international law to sanction them in the capacity of neutral countries, but without implementing military or diplomatic intervention. This Lamas Treaty was established in 1933. Although more than ten countries signed it, only three countries have ratified it. Now, its content is included in the American Peace Treaty and unanimously passed by twenty-one countries, which is a great contribution to the maintenance of American peace. Therefore, if the content of the American Peace Treaty is carefully analyzed, it has a very important meaning.</p>
<p>As for the important point in the protocol, it stipulates that "no country shall interfere, directly or indirectly, in the internal and diplomatic affairs of other countries." This is a clear stipulation of the American Good Neighbor Policy and a concrete manifestation of the American abandonment of the narrow interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine.</p>
<p>At a time when aggressors in Europe and Asia are invading everywhere, and ambitious imperialists are frantically trampling on international treaties, the twenty-one countries of the Americas can actually gather together, convene a peace conference, and establish a treaty to maintain peace. This is truly a cause for celebration.</p>
<h3>British First Lord of the Admiralty Announces Naval Modernization Plan; Battleships to Increase to Twenty; Singapore Actively Strengthening Defenses</h3>
<p>(London) First Lord of the Admiralty Hoare recently stated in a report to the House of Commons yesterday afternoon: "The battleships that have been modernized include the Royal Oak and Revenge, both with a tonnage of 29,150 tons. Those currently being modernized include the Monarch, Ramillies, Resolution (all 29,150 tons), Barham, Warspite, and Malaya (all 31,000 tons). The Queen Elizabeth and Valiant (both 31,000 tons) will also be modernized." Naval figures believe that after the completion of this modernization plan, the existing British battleships will continue to serve for many years. In addition, the government plans to add five more battleships, two of which will begin construction in January next year. In this way, the number of British battleships can be increased from fifteen to twenty by 1940. [Note: In addition to the above ten battleships, Britain currently has the Renown, Repulse (both 32,000 tons), Hood (42,100 tons), Nelson (33,500 tons), and Rodney (33,900 tons), five battleships.] (17th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Singapore) Singapore is a key British stronghold in the Far East. In the future, the troops defending the area may expand the ranks of Asians. Currently, the Chinese and Malay teams in the local volunteer army have increased their responsibilities for coastal defense and have received training in air defense and coastal defense. Malays in the naval reserve receive training on the HMS Laburnum, which is permanently stationed here. They also participated in the last exercise at the same time as the regular navy. The newly established auxiliary force is designed to cooperate with the army. There are now hundreds of Chinese and Malays requesting to join the army, but they are mostly assigned to mechanical and engineering work. In addition, there are Eurasians who are also requesting to form a special team. (16th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Italian Agreement Negotiations Concluded; British House of Commons Discusses</h3>
<p>(London) Negotiations between Britain and Italy regarding the Gentleman's Agreement on the Mediterranean issue have almost concluded. However, the officials of the two countries are temporarily delaying the announcement of the agreement. There are two reasons for this. First, the issue of the British and French embassies in the Abyssinian capital being converted into consulates general is currently being discussed between the British and French governments. Both Britain and Italy hope to resolve this issue first. Second, the British side hopes to obtain assurances that the Spanish issue will not cause disputes between Britain and Italy. Judging from the situation in the past few days, Italy's attitude towards the Spanish issue has slightly changed. Therefore, some people hope that Italy may gradually break away from Germany's influence and take unified action with Britain and France on the issue of neutrality in the Spanish civil war. (6th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) During the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, some members questioned Foreign Secretary Eden on the relations between Britain and Italy and the Spanish issue. Eden confirmed that the British government had obtained guarantees from Italy that there would be no changes to the territorial status of the Balearic Islands in the Spanish Mediterranean. Labor Party member Baker immediately asked Eden to submit the original text of the guarantee made by the Italian government to the secretariat of the House of Commons for review. Eden replied that this guarantee was verbal. Sir Drummond, the British ambassador to Italy, was instructed by his government to state to Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano that any change in the territorial status of the Balearic Islands was of "great concern" to Britain. Ciano immediately assured Drummond that before and after the outbreak of the Spanish civil war, the Italian government sought to negotiate with the leaders of the two nationalist governments, hoping that there would be no impact on the status of the Mediterranean. In the future, Italy does not intend to conduct such negotiations. Regarding this matter, it was subsequently confirmed by the Italian Navy to the naval counselor of the British Embassy in Italy, and the Italian Ambassador to Britain, Grandi, has also made similar guarantees to the British government several times. Eden then replied to Labor Party member Leach's question, saying: "Britain does not intend to legally recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. As for Abyssinia's position in the League of Nations, it will not become a problem until the next League of Nations General Assembly, so the League of Nations can temporarily not ask about this matter." Eden finally replied to a question from independent member Lady Rathbone, saying that "the issue of the British diplomatic representative to Abyssinia is currently being considered by the Foreign Office."

<h3>Britain and Liberia Restore Diplomatic Relations; All Rebel Tribal Chiefs Surrender to the Government</h3>
<p>Monrovia: Diplomatic relations between Britain and the West African black republic of Liberia, which have been severed for five years, have now been restored. Britain withdrew diplomatic recognition from the republic in 1931 because the report of the League of Nations Commission on Slavery revealed as much as possible the slavery situation in Liberia, and Liberia was also a member of the League of Nations. The origin of the Republic of Liberia is due to several American charitable organizations establishing a colony in West Africa as a permanent residence for freed American slaves. In 1822, a settlement was demarcated near the site of present-day Monrovia. On July 26, 1847, a nation was established, the free and independent Republic of Liberia, first recognized by Britain and France, and then by other countries. The constitution of the republic, although derived from the United States, has many important differences. The national administrative power is exercised by the president and the executive Yuan composed of eight ministers, and the legislative power is in the bicameral parliament. The president's term is eight years, senators six years, and family members four years. Voters must be of black descent and own land. Although the natives of the country all have the right to participate in politics, except for the citizens of various civilized centers, no one participates in politics. The official language of the government is English. Subsequently, after the republic corrected the various situations revealed in the report, the governments of other countries immediately restored diplomatic relations with it, but Britain still did not grant diplomatic recognition due to the rebellion in the Sasstown region of the republic. Recently, the chiefs of all rebel tribes have unconditionally surrendered to the government, so the diplomatic relations between Britain and Liberia have returned to normal. Liberian President Barclay has promised to pardon the rebellious tribes. (17th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebel Planes Bomb Madrid Again: 20 Bombers, 80-90 Killed</h3>
<p>Madrid: The battles around the capital have been relatively quiet recently due to poor weather. However, last night, 20 large bombers and 32 fighter planes bombed the western part of the city, causing severe damage to the working-class areas. Government machine-gun teams quickly repelled the aircraft. The number of casualties from this bombing is high. This morning, estimates put the death toll between 80 and 100, with over 100 injured. The government claims that its forces shot down four rebel planes. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Five Nationalist bombers and fourteen fighter planes bombed Madrid today. Six bombs exploded in the northwestern district. Due to rain and heavy fog, the planes flew at low altitudes. Government fighter planes immediately ascended to intercept them, and the sound of machine guns was deafening throughout the city. The Nationalist planes then flew to the Maiadahonda area, five miles northwest of Madrid, and dropped a total of 40 bombs, destroying five civilian houses. They then bombed the Tetuán working-class district, killing four and injuring over 200. One government plane and two Nationalist planes crashed near the Princess Bridge during the intense fighting. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Eighteen Nationalist bombers, covered by twenty-seven fighter planes, flew in again around 1 PM yesterday and dropped bombs. Residents fled into cellars upon hearing the alarm, but there were still 80 to 100 casualties. The number of injured is still unknown. In addition, about 50 houses were destroyed. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Nationalist planes had not bombed the capital for the past ten days, but they returned and dropped bombs around 1 PM today. The bombing focused on the northern suburbs of Pozuelo and the Cuatro Caminos district. Fifteen government fighter planes immediately took off to engage them, ultimately shooting down two Nationalist planes. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Madrid: A special report from our correspondent states that government forces repelled the Nationalists in the western suburb of Boadilla del Monte yesterday and advanced one kilometer. The Nationalist attack was extremely fierce, and the soldiers were well-trained and skilled in combat, using the latest weaponry. According to government militiamen, the first line of Nationalist defense is manned by Germans. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Toledo: According to an official Nationalist announcement, Nationalist forces completely occupied the key point of the Madrid front, Boadilla del Monte, last night in a bayonet charge. The defending forces abandoned many supplies during their retreat, including three armored cars. After occupying the town, the Nationalists continued to advance and seized several positions previously held by the International Brigades. There was extremely fierce fighting on the Madrid front yesterday. Government forces launched a strong attack on the rebel positions in the former royal gardens in the southern suburbs. According to the Nationalists, after a full day of battle, the government troops retreated to their original positions. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The government issued a public statement at noon today stating that in the past 24 hours, the rebels have been advancing on all fronts around Madrid. Their mechanized units even broke into the western suburb of Boadilla del Monte, where the militiamen put up strong resistance. Yesterday, the rebels also dispatched a large number of planes to bomb Madrid. The air battle yesterday was the most intense since the civil war approached the capital. The rebels used 20 German Junkers three-engine bombers and 28 Heinkel fighter planes in the attack. 25 government planes immediately took off to engage them, shooting down five rebel planes. Government planes also sustained damage. In addition, the rebels also launched an offensive on the northwestern Asturias front, but it was unsuccessful. All other areas were relatively peaceful. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Salamanca: The Nationalist authorities issued a public statement stating that Nationalist forces occupied positions abandoned by government troops in the western suburb of Boadilla del Monte, seizing three tanks, three artillery pieces, two ambulances, three machine guns, and 82 bodies of government soldiers left on the battlefield. There was no other fighting elsewhere. (Havas, 17th)</p>

<p>Barcelona: After internal turmoil within the Catalan Autonomous Government's Executive Council, it has been reorganized. According to semi-official sources, the new Executive Council is composed of seven representatives from labor unions (four from the Anarchist CNT and three from the Socialist UGT), three representatives from the Left Republican Party, and one representative from the Farmers' Party. Representatives from the Trotskyist POUM have been excluded. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Perpignan, France: Four Spanish rebel bombers flew to Port-Vendres on the Mediterranean coast on the Franco-Spanish border today and bombed the area, injuring one French person. Their objective was to cut off railway traffic to prevent the supply of food, munitions, and other goods to Catalonia. The planes then flew over Céret in French airspace but did not drop bombs. They then flew back to Port-Vendres and continued bombing. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>

<h3>German Cruiser Interrogates British Ship; Spanish Rebels Announce Ships Must Show Lights</h3>
<p>Gibraltar: The British merchant ship "Oxford City," loaded with cargo from Liverpool, England, bound for the Near East, made a brief stop here. According to the ship's owner, when the ship was sailing in Portuguese waters, it was ordered to stop by the 10,000-ton German pocket cruiser "Deutschland." After thoroughly questioning the ship about its origins and destination, it was allowed to proceed. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) Political circles here were quite surprised by the news of the German pocket battleship Deutschland's actions. Well-informed sources in London said that the German ship's actions were just a "friendly greeting" and that the British ship's captain must have misunderstood. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) The diplomatic correspondent for the Liberal Manchester Guardian recently commented on the Spanish Civil War, saying that the war had reached a stalemate. However, it is hard to believe that German Führer Hitler would risk acting on the Iberian Peninsula. A German in the Spanish Nationalist army said that the Nationalists were not good at fighting. But since the Germans are helping them, why should the Nationalist troops bother to fight hard? As for intentions, Germany's aid to the Nationalists does not seem to be escalating, so it is doubtful whether Germany will fully support the Nationalists so that they can achieve final victory. The correspondent also said that, as far as the Spanish war is concerned, the Soviet planes used by the government forces are definitely better than the German planes used by the Nationalists. Among the German planes, the performance of the bombers is particularly disappointing, but German-made anti-aircraft guns and artillery used to resist tanks are excellent. On the other hand, tanks made by both Germany and the Soviet Union are not very effective. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Saragossa: The Nationalist authorities will issue a notice via radio within five days to inform all ships that want to pass through Spanish waters that they must show lights to avoid being pursued by Nationalist warships. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>British Shipping in the Far East is Stagnant; Seeking Ways to Remedy the Situation; Resisting Japanese Competition</h3>
<p>(London) Board of Trade MP Dr. Burgin, replying in the House of Commons today to Conservative MP Sir Grattan-Doyle, agreed to report on the status of British shipping in the Far East. The MP, noting the unsatisfactory state of British shipping in the Far East, wanted to know if the matter would be submitted to the Imperial Shipping Committee for study and to devise remedies. Dr. Burgin stated that the Imperial Shipping Committee had already been studying British shipping in the Far East and elsewhere, and that the government would ask it to submit a special report. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) At the annual shareholders' meeting of British India Steam Navigation Company on the 9th of this month, Chairman Shaw reported on the development of Japanese shipping in the East, saying that Britain should catch up quickly to remedy the situation and avoid the decline of British imperial shipping. Last month, former High Commissioner to Egypt Lord Lloyd also delivered a speech in the House of Lords, strongly asserting the need to revitalize British shipping. The public is paying close attention to these two statements. Well-informed sources in the shipping industry predict that the government may introduce legislation, using Japan's ban on foreign merchant ships sailing along the Japanese coast as a reason, to stipulate that all British territories, such as Bombay, Ceylon, Singapore, and Hong Kong, will prohibit Japanese merchant ships from sailing along their coasts. Last year, at the annual meeting of British India Steam Navigation Company, Chairman Shaw also gave a speech attacking the activities of American shipping in the Pacific. Later, the New Zealand government introduced legislation to prohibit foreign ships from sailing between New Zealand and Australia. If the British government were to prohibit Japanese ships from sailing along the coasts of British territories in the East because of Shaw's speech, Japanese shipping would inevitably suffer a fatal blow. It is expected that Japan will repeal its ban on foreign ships sailing along its coasts to give Britain no excuse. (Havas, 16th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Shimpūtai Incident: Conspiracy for Violent Coup; Plan Leaked and Failed</h3>
<p>—Truth Revealed by the Judicial Authorities—</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Shimpūtai Incident, the first case of preliminary conspiracy for internal disorder under the current Japanese criminal law, was being handled by the preliminary examination department of the Grand Court. The preliminary examination judge of the Tokyo District Court, Ryōkaku, was the judge in charge. The investigation, which lasted a year, has concluded the preliminary examination and has been handed over to the special trial department of the Grand Court. On the afternoon of the 17th, Judge Izumi II sent a memorandum to Grand Court President Ikeda to take procedures. At the same time, the Ministry of Justice announced the factual outline of the incident as follows:</p>
<p>Takao Amano and others believed that the country was on the verge of losing the Japanese spirit and that a major reform was needed. By means of a so-called armed uprising, they planned to overthrow the Saitō Cabinet and destroy the existing ruling structure of the nation's political center at once, creating turmoil in the capital that would lead to martial law. They would then request the issuance of an imperial edict and establish a temporary emergency cabinet, with it as the center, to organize a new political structure. Guided by Japanese-ism, they would fundamentally abolish laws, the economy, politics, and other organizational systems, and revise the Constitution of the Empire to implement the so-called Shōwa Restoration. To achieve this goal, they planned to drop bombs on the Prime Minister's official residence and the Metropolitan Police Department from an airplane at 11:00 AM on July 7, 1933, when the Cabinet was scheduled to meet at the Prime Minister's official residence. Using this as a signal, the ground action team led by the defendant Torao Maeda would rise up all at once, attacking the Prime Minister's official residence, the Metropolitan Police Department, the Minister of the Imperial Household's official residence, the Seiyūkai headquarters, the Minseitō headquarters, the Social Democratic Party headquarters, the Nippon Kangyo Bank, as well as the residences of Navy Admiral Gonnohyōe Yamamoto, Seiyūkai President Kisaburō Suzuki, and Minseitō President Reijirō Wakatsuki, setting them on fire, killing Prime Minister Saitō Makoto and other cabinet ministers and leaders of the various political parties, occupying the Metropolitan Police Department and the Kangyo Bank, and holding them until martial law was implemented. They were making various preparations, but due to wavering among their comrades, the plan was postponed once. Later, they rescheduled the revolt for 11:00 AM on the 11th, using the same means and methods as above, when the Cabinet was scheduled to meet at the Prime Minister's official residence. On the night of the 10th, dozens of members of the ground action team, including Torao Maeda and Kiichi Suzuki, were arrested while waiting at the Meiji Shrine in Shibuya Ward, Tokyo, so the riot plan was discovered and thwarted before it could be carried out.

<h3>French Radical Party Trusts Government; Supports Domestic and Foreign Policies; Daladier Speaks on National Defense</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Executive Committee of the Radical Socialist Party recently passed a resolution almost unanimously expressing confidence in the current government, stating: "The current government's foreign policy, which focuses on maintaining peace and improving relations between France and other democratic and peace-loving nations, should be supported. As for domestic affairs, the party should fully support the government's efforts to strengthen national defense. For the social policies it is promoting to be completely successful and to restore the national economy, it is especially necessary to maintain order and abide by the republican legal system. The party should faithfully adhere to the commitments it made when the Popular Front was formed, but other parties belonging to the Popular Front should also have the same loyalty." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The issue of national defense was discussed at a meeting of the Executive Committee of the French Radical Party. Minister of National Defense Daladier delivered a speech to the audience, stating that the French Cabinet would not consider shortening the two-year compulsory military service period until the international situation became clear, and that the issue of reducing military spending was not something the government was currently attempting. The minister went on to say that the current army system gives France a standing army of 600,000, of which 150,000 are stationed in North Africa and 50,000 are stationed in other colonies. The minister said that France must have the ability to defend its territorial integrity, and that defending its territorial integrity requires great sacrifices. (National Telegram, 17th) Daladier went on to describe the foreign policy of the Popular Front government, saying that "the relationship between France and the United States and Great Britain has never been closer than it is today, and the sincere relationship between France and the Little Entente countries could not be better." (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) France's new military equipment bond went on sale today.

<h3>Difficulties Arise in German-Austrian Cooperation; Negotiations Begin Today</h3>
<p>(Vienna) Regarding the economic cooperation between Germany and Austria, the representatives of both sides previously appointed a subcommittee to study it. It is reported that significant difficulties have been discovered, which could be an obstacle to the future. The representatives of both sides are scheduled to hold the first plenary meeting today to discuss the matter. The difficulties encountered by the subcommittee are twofold: (1) Germany lacks foreign exchange and raw materials, and therefore cannot manufacture the goods needed by the Austrian market; (2) Austria has commercial treaties with other countries, which are binding, especially regarding coal imports, and it is inconvenient to favor Germany. The semi-official Federal Post recently reported that German goods imported into Austria have recently decreased. Imports of raw materials have decreased by 44%, food by 75%, industrial products by 23%, and cotton textiles by 60%. The decrease in the quantity of cotton textiles imported is due to Germany's lack of raw materials. On the other hand, Austrian goods exported to Germany have greatly increased, such as dairy products and timber, which have doubled in recent years. The newspaper concludes that it is hoped that the economic negotiations between Germany and Austria will be successful. (Havas, 17th)</p>

<p>(London) During today's House of Commons meeting, the satisfactory outcome of Hong Kong Governor Sir Geoffry Northcote's visit to Guangzhou and the Guangzhou authorities' reciprocal visit was discussed. Conservative MP Mr. Molson asked Foreign Secretary Eden whether he had paid attention to this matter and whether he would inform the Chinese government as soon as possible of the British government's satisfaction with the harmonious relationship between Hong Kong and Guangzhou. The Foreign Secretary replied, "I have repeatedly expressed this goodwill on behalf of the government, and I believe the Chinese government will also be as fully comforted as we are by this friendly relationship." Mr. Molson then asked whether this could be considered an appropriate opportunity to consider holding a British goods exhibition in Hong Kong to open up potential markets. The Foreign Secretary replied that he could not determine whether such a question should be answered by him. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) Conservative MP Mr. Molson today urged Foreign Secretary Eden in the House of Commons to pay attention to the statement by the Inspector General of the Chinese Maritime Customs regarding the situation of smuggling in North China.

<h3>The Philippines Will Not Join the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Manila) Mr. Pineda, a famous Philippine educator and professor of economics at the University of the Philippines, recently returned from a global tour and has a proposal for the Philippine government to establish an office in Geneva to have direct contact with the League of Nations Secretariat. It is said that the Philippines' foreign affairs are still handled by the U.S. State Department. The Philippines may not join the League of Nations, but the Philippines can directly participate in the League of Nations' non-political activities, such as the International Labor Organization, without going through Washington. It is heard that President Quezon is quite in favor of this proposal and will instruct Mr. Pineda to discuss it with the Ministers of Justice and Interior. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>Japan's National Policy for Iron and Steel</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of Commerce and Industry Ogawa is scheduled to hold separate discussions with private representatives in the coming days regarding the national policy for iron and steel, preparing to establish a fundamental policy. According to Minister of Commerce and Industry's opinion, the content of the national policy for iron and steel is generally as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Develop overseas iron and steel resources; (2) Actively develop mines such as Anshan in Manchuria and Musan in Korea, and utilize domestic ore; (3) Implement the Krupp direct ironmaking method to process ore sources; (4) Concretely implement the control of iron ore imports and distribution.</p>
<p>Japan's current iron ore production is only 13.4 million tons, and most of it is sourced from China's Manchuria and other foreign countries, amounting to about 4 million tons per year. After Japan implements its five-year ironmaking plan, it will need no less than 10 million tons of iron ore. Therefore, securing iron ore resources is currently an urgent task.

<h3>The Distance Between Nations (3)</h3>
<p>— Xu Xu</p>
<p>Habits are the distance between nations, language is the barrier between nations. Besides these, I think prejudice is also a kind of distance that cannot be separated from habits. For example, the attitude of that girl towards me, as I mentioned above, is because she had a preconceived notion in her mind. This kind of prejudice is very powerful. I often see in books and hear people talk about the arrogance of the British, so when I was eating at the same table with a British young man in a Beijing apartment, because I had this prejudice, I decided not to talk to him. According to the customs of Belgium, everyone should say "Bonjour, Monsieur" when they meet, but he came in later and didn't say hello to everyone (there were also several people from other countries at the table), so I felt even more that the British were arrogant. But after the meal, we started talking. His French was worse than mine, but because I could manage in English, the language barrier was finally overcome. Since we were both in Belgium, the distance of habits was also gone. The only distance was the idea of "British arrogance" in my mind. But he spoke to me first. After a greeting, he talked about politics. He opposed Fascism and was not satisfied with Britain. He was studying music in Beijing, and the violin and piano were his specialties, but when he talked about politics, he talked to me for three hours. There was no distance between us at all, and I had long forgotten that he was British.</p>
<p>Westerners find it easier to express their political opinions, ideological positions, and sympathy for doctrines than Chinese and Indians (if they have them in their hearts). Such an attitude is absolutely impossible in China. This is probably because China has a wrong idea that studying communism means being a communist, sympathizing with Trotsky means being a Trotskyist, and supporting nationalism means being a reactionary traitor. Therefore, when people meet, they can only remain silent and talk about "the weather today, haha" and nothing more. On this point, I feel deeply that Westerners are much easier to approach because only when you talk about beliefs and ideas can two people's souls truly connect.</p>
<p>On the ship, I met a Swiss man who supported Mussolini and Hitler, supported Italy's conquest of Abyssinia, and implicitly supported Japan's invasion of China. He believed that it was a beneficial thing for the world to have civilized people take over places that were not advanced and were in chaos. A French friend was with him all day, but this French friend did not support France and instead praised Hitler. On the ship, I was reading a Zola novel "Unemployment." My main purpose was to practice French, but he said, why do you read Zola's things? Zola always talks about the poor and tears; there is no aesthetic sense at all. So in art, they are aesthetes. They do not form religions, but I said that the pinnacle of Italian culture is religion. God, religion, and Mussolini are a trinity. He was not angry when he heard this and sincerely told me that this was because the Italian and Spanish nations had a very strong religious nature. He knew very little about China and had no prejudice, but in the end, because I did not agree with his fundamental ideas, there was a huge distance between us. This distance did not belong to "nation" but to thought and consciousness, which prevented us from getting too close.</p>
<p>A Frenchman may hate his motherland and praise Hitler. Chinese people who have specialized skills can become traitors. Where is the distance between people? I remember Marx said, "Workers have no motherland." In fact, merchants often have no motherland. During the European war, German arms dealers bought arms for the Allied countries, and Allied arms dealers bought arms for Germany. These are all facts. In addition, farmers, students, and ordinary people sometimes just want a more comfortable life. In fact, the distance between people does not lie in the difference between nations but in the difference in interests and thoughts. The distance between nations is only a matter of habits and prejudices. Once these two are seen through and accustomed to, they become natural. For example, Westerners are very clear about the separation of money between friends. When drinking a cup of coffee together, each person pays for their own. When taking a train together, each person buys their own ticket. These things can easily make us feel their stinginess, but this is just a habit. So, once these habits and prejudices are overcome, there is no distance between different nations. If there is, it lies in thought and meaning, but it exists equally within the same nation. At the same time, so-called habits and prejudices do not necessarily not exist between people of the same nation. The reason why they can be absent between people of the same nation is still because they can understand and forgive each other. In fact, many middle school and university students who cannot understand and forgive Indians will also be unable to understand our compatriots in Mongolia, Gansu, and Xinjiang. I even encountered rural farmers in Jinpu. Chinese education is really a failure in some ways. Many Western-style buildings with fully Europeanized facilities and architecture are too far from Chinese social life, making those children who have lived there for four or six years seem to have transformed into another, so much more superior nation. They seem to be a little disdainful of calling the entire nation a nation.</p>
<p>In fact, can spitting on the ground or not throwing away a toothpick (I think Indians may also use ivory or silver toothpicks like the Chinese used to, so they have the habit of not throwing away used toothpicks. I didn't ask the Indians clearly at the time, so I dare not be dogmatic. Note this for reference) affect their unity and friendship if people who agree in thought and sentiment are able to mutually accommodate? We always remember that Gandhi even had Western women as his followers!</p>
<p>I feel that it is a bit counterproductive to maintain the distance between two nations because of a small amount of contempt in a habit.</p>
<p>When Chinese students look down on Indians, I deeply feel that the vast future belongs to the world of white people. Even if Chinese students have long had the habit of catering to their Europeanization, what will we feel in our hearts if they look down on us with their prejudices? Looking back, how much does China's international status differ from India's now? China's present has no time to look down on others but should pay attention to those who look down on us!</p>

<h3>Enthusiastic Support for Suiyuan in Tianjin: Male and Female Students Eagerly Donate; A Certain Party Enviously Makes Repeated Inquiries</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The support and comfort work for Suiyuan is still enthusiastic and tense here. However, due to environmental constraints, it has been reduced from universal to simple and from social to group. It is not like other places where open fundraising is conducted from all parties, or there are responsible organizations acting on behalf of receiving funds. Out of a sense of patriotism and love for the nation, those who donate funds to help the soldiers on the front lines do so voluntarily, or they collect funds from the institutions and groups to which they belong and entrust them to newspapers and banks for remittance. Almost all people's organizations and guilds are unable to receive and transfer large sums of money on behalf of organizations other than themselves to avoid the jealousy of a certain party. Only two major newspapers openly receive and transfer donations. Although no one advocates and promotes it, the public's enthusiasm for fundraising and donations has not diminished. Even rickshaw pullers and news vendors know that the current resistance war of our Suiyuan army is a struggle for the survival of the nation and the rise and fall of the country. They are willing to give up the clothes donated by the people in the past and ask the newspapers to transport them to the front lines. Such universal patriotic enthusiasm is probably greater than the "September 18th" and "January 28th" incidents.</p>
<p>The male and female students of Tianjin Middle Gu College are very enthusiastic about raising money for patriotism. The colleges have launched campaigns to save food and collect donations, using one day's income as military comfort funds. After one campaign, they follow with a second and third. The female students of the Women's Normal College even advocate eating cornbread for a month, without meat or fish, and sending it down with plain water, saving more than 1,000 yuan of food expenses for a month, all of which is sent to the front lines. Their spirit is even more admirable. In addition to tomb donations, secondary schools and above also recommend representatives to take money to the front lines to comfort the soldiers' hard work, wading through the ice and snow to see the situation on the front lines as comfort. Whenever the representatives return, they are invited by the colleges to listen to their lectures. When the representatives describe the heroic soldiers killing enemies, the general enthusiastic youth are all agitated and hate not being able to immediately put themselves on the battlefield to resist foreign aggression. Now, the students of various colleges, having learned from the return reports of several batches of representatives, know that the soldiers on the front lines need wool socks, gloves, gas masks, and other items, and that medical care and nursing are urgently needed. The students of various colleges have changed their current form of cash comfort and changed to in-kind donations, doing their best to use their knowledge and skills for research. The students of the Industrial College are developing gas masks, the students of the Women's Normal College are making vests and gloves, and the students of Nankai are practicing first aid. Although they are all doing it in their spare time, with the intelligence and thinking of hundreds and thousands of people, the progress is also very rapid. Previously, the students of various colleges planned to expand the fundraising campaign to the social world, but the authorities were worried about accidents and secretly advised the colleges to stop. Although the patriotic fundraising of various industrial and commercial groups is well-intentioned, they are helpless due to the environment. A certain party sends personnel to inquire from time to time, making direct inquiries, so everyone is afraid to proceed for fear of causing trouble. A certain party's military police headquarters, military command headquarters, and special agencies send personnel to various guilds and groups all day long to conduct investigations, with the intention of intimidating and suppressing them, preventing our industry and commerce from expanding the patriotic movement and affecting their side. A certain country's military police recently went to a certain guild and a certain school to inquire whether they had purchased medicines and helmets to send to the Suiyuan front lines. After explaining that there was no such thing, the military police left with suspicion. There are many such inquiries, all with the intention of preventing the expansion of our people's resistance movement. Therefore, in this kind of environment, patriotic movements are not allowed to be free, but it is gratifying that the students are still able to raise money and donate goods to the soldiers on the front lines.</p>
<h3>Fujian Taiwan Inspection Group Returns to Xiamen; Issues Written Statement and Interview Describing Inspection Process</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The Taiwan Inspection Group organized by political and banking circles in Fujian Province, including Xiamen Mayor Li Shilin, Director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau Liu Wenzuan, Staff Member Zou Zhaokun, He Shan Special District Chief Liu Jitang, Xiamen Central Bank Branch Manager Shu Houde, Zhongnan Bank President Zhang Shuchun, Jinjiang County Chief Zhang Si, Huian County Chief Lin Honghui, Fuqing County Chief Mao Yingzhang, Yongding County Chief Zhong Gancheng, and Fujian National Economic Construction Branch Committee Member Lin Bingkang, a group of eleven people, took the Fengshan Maru to Taiwan for inspection on the 1st of this month and returned to Xiamen on the Hong Kong Maru on the morning of the 14th. Li and others issued a joint written statement describing the inspection process, saying, "During this visit to Taiwan, the colleagues were warmly received by the Governor-General's Office and local officials, and their kindness was appreciated. During the eleven days in Taiwan, they visited Taipei, Hsinchu, Taichung, Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung, and other places from north to south. Thanks to the assistance of the Governor-General's personnel and our country's consulate in Taiwan, it was very convenient. Along the way, the overseas Chinese warmly welcomed us and asked about the recent situation of their hometowns, which shows their concern for their fellow villagers and is very gratifying. Taiwan's construction has been rapid due to its natural advantages and the improvement of artificial improvements, especially the increase in agricultural products, which is most noteworthy. Although this trip was limited by time, the colleagues were unable to travel to the entire island, but they did visit the essence of the western region and obtained a wealth of information, which will be very helpful for future reference. They deeply feel that the biggest reasons for the development of Taiwan's industry are: first, the climate is suitable, the land is fertile, and the government is working hard to produce construction, so the land is used to its fullest; second, due to the development of transportation, not only are light railways accessible everywhere, but there are also highways to connect with each other, making the transportation of goods extremely convenient, so that things can be used to their fullest; third, the society from top to bottom can each do their best, and the farmers are diligent in their work, so that people can work together." In the afternoon, Li Shilin met with reporters to discuss the inspection, focusing on agricultural and industrial industries. I am responsible for public health, Director Liu is responsible for highway engineering, County Chief Zhang is paying attention to opium suppression and opium monopoly, County Chief Zhong is paying attention to the rural economy, County Chief Lin is paying attention to the fishing and sugar cane industries, and County Chief Mao is inspecting the grain storage cooperatives. According to the inspection, the best is agriculture. It was jointly decided that transportation, sanitation, and fishing industries, and even the mountains, are planted with trees, and there is no wasteland. All kinds of products are extremely abundant. The production of sugar cane alone is enough to be surprising. The sugar industry is so good, all thanks to the improvement of sugar cane varieties. It is a pity that the export of sugar cane seedlings is now prohibited, and there is no way to borrow them. However, many methods of growing sugar cane have been obtained, which can be used for reference. Industries such as cement and handicrafts are also extremely developed. There are 50,000 overseas Chinese in Taiwan, all of whom are Fujianese except for more than 1,000 Cantonese. (December 16th)</p>
<h3>Record of an Interview with Father Lebbe</h3>
<p>—Correspondence from the Front (2)—</p>
<p>When we were in Gui Sui, we learned that Father Lebbe had also arrived in Suiyuan and was enthusiastically working to rescue our country's wounded soldiers. Therefore, we went to the public hospital at the Great School Field to visit him. There were more than thirty wounded soldiers staying in the public hospital, so we took the opportunity to visit them first. Here, we saw Liu Houyu, the driver of the armored vehicle that first attacked Bailingmiao. He was the deputy captain of the motor vehicle team and was injured in his right arm. We also saw Wang Dianshi, a cavalryman who took the lead in charging into Bailingmiao to set fire to and destroy the enemy's oil depot and was burned. He belonged to the First Special Company of the Eighth Cavalry Regiment. There was also Staff Officer Xi, who was wounded in the chest by bombing at Honggertu (he died from his injuries). A total of thirty-eight people were staying there, most of whom were seriously injured. After offering our condolences, we withdrew and came out. However, Father Lebbe was not at home at this time, so we decided to visit him on another day. We met Father Lebbe at ten o'clock in the morning on the appointed day. After entering the reception room, Father Lebbe arrived after a while. He was wearing a gray cloth robe with a black collar embroidered with a "cross" and with several patches. This was the attire of a priest. He was bald, with a short beard, a smiling face, and an air of kindness and gentleness. After exchanging greetings, we explained our purpose and began our conversation.</p>
<p>He was originally a Belgian and came to our country to preach at the age of twenty-four, and has been here for thirty-six years. Soon after he arrived in our country, he felt that there were many errors in the Chinese church. Especially in the church in our country, it was purely a foreign institution, using a special spirit to maintain the faith of the church members. Ecclesiastical power had fallen by the wayside, and he always felt that it was not very appropriate. Because he held the ambition to restore ecclesiastical power, he became a citizen of our country in 1927 and obtained the position of Chinese bishop from the Roman Pope. Now in the Suiyuan Diocese, there are already more than twenty Chinese bishops and eighty or ninety foreign bishops. He said that he was not excluding foreigners from coming to China to preach, but felt that those in charge of the Chinese church should belong to China, so that they could promote the unique spirit of the Chinese nation in religion.</p>
<p>During the Long Wall Resistance against Japan, he led hundreds of church members to rescue the wounded at the front, benefiting many soldiers who were fighting the enemy. Now that the Battle of Suiyuan has broken out, he feels that for the country and for the region, he has an unshirkable responsibility. So he gathered church members again and organized a stretcher team, with himself as the commander-in-chief. He then told us about the organization and plan of the stretcher team, roughly saying that this plan, like the resistance at Xifengkou during the Long Wall Resistance, was to serve as the front-line stretcher team. The organization was divided into four teams, each with thirty stretchers, five people per stretcher, for a total of four hundred people. All of them were church members from his diocese. If the war progressed further, the number could be increased at any time. This time, organizing the stretcher team was much more convenient. First, they were all locals, and their winter clothing was very complete. Second, the area of activity was in this province, and they were very familiar with the geography. When church members joined the team, they had to sign a pledge, the main points of which were to fulfill their obligations completely, without receiving any remuneration, and to sacrifice themselves for the country, without receiving compensation after death. This stretcher team will be leaving for the front line again in a few days.</p>
<p>He spoke pure Northern Mandarin. After talking for a quarter of an hour, the attendant frequently urged him, saying that the car was ready and he should go to the train station. So he stood up and apologized deeply, saying that he could not talk longer and had to go to Pingdiquan immediately. So we asked him to take a photo and said goodbye.</p>
<p>In the Battle of Honggertu in eastern Suiyuan, local church members bravely fought the enemy (each diocese in Suiyuan has guns and training) and contributed a lot of strength and sacrificed many lives. These heroic deeds must be said to be due to the influence of Father Lebbe's great spirit. Although that was not his diocese, we hold this enthusiastic, brave, and compassionate old man in respect and admiration.

The citizens were very moved and many voluntarily got up to help clean the sidewalks. The Women's Work Committee led by Ms. Shen Huilian worked hard to clean up, which won the praise of the citizens. According to the report of the inspection team of the New Life Movement Headquarters and the Capital New Life Movement on the results of the cleanup on that day, all parts of the city were cleaner than before. The Capital New Life Movement has also formulated measures for citizens to maintain cleanliness regularly, and the police station and labor service groups will notify all citizens to comply.</p>

The wedding ceremony was originally scheduled to be held at 10:00 AM, but due to the continuous rain on this day, the ceremony hall was temporarily moved to the relief room in front of the Kong Mansion. Because the arrangement took a long time, it was changed to the afternoon. The groomsmen were Kong Degao and Kong Jingjiang, and the bridesmaids were Sun Shufang, the sister of Sun Qifang, and Kong Demao, the sister of Kong Decheng. The officiant was Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government (represented by He Siyuan), and the introducer was Li Shuchun, Director of the Shandong Department of Civil Affairs (represented by He Siyuan). He Siyuan, Director of the Education Department, also represented Deng Jiayan of the Central Party Headquarters, who was originally scheduled to attend but did not arrive due to circumstances.

The Sun residence used two geese instead of two wild geese. After the ceremony, the bride was welcomed to the Kong residence. At 2:00 PM, the wedding ceremony was held, using the new rites. Tu Lifu was the master of ceremonies, and Wang Xiaoyin was the ritual supervisor.

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Provincial Commissioner Arrives in Changshu to Clear Overdue Taxes</p>
<p>Due to successive years of poor harvests in this county, farmers have not been able to pay their taxes consistently, resulting in significant accumulated arrears. Recently, the Jiangsu Department of Finance discovered that the county government of this county had many malpractices in the collection of grain taxes. The collected funds did not benefit the country above or the people below but mostly ended up in the hands of those collecting the taxes, who issued private receipts, embezzled national currency, and enriched themselves. Therefore, Commissioner Dong Chengqi was specially dispatched to Changshu to be responsible for clearing the arrears and to investigate the various malpractices in detail in order to eliminate them.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Motorboat Discovered at Duanshan Port</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Various Circles Telegraph Requesting Punishment of Zhang</p>
<p>Since the sudden outbreak of the Xi'an Incident, various circles in Wuxi have been extremely indignant. Yesterday morning, Commissioner Zang Qifang, together with the Party and government officials, convened a joint meeting of representatives of local institutions and organizations. First, County Magistrate Long reported on the course of the Xi'an Incident and that the local military strength in this county was very substantial and the public order was very consolidated. Everyone should concentrate their efforts, under the leadership of the government, to jointly maintain order and pay attention to reactionary elements taking the opportunity to stir up trouble. If any action is discovered, Commissioner Zang will report it. (1) Zhang Xueliang's personality is to be clever and use others and he has no national concept at all. (2) The strength of the Northeast Army, at the time of the September 18th Incident, had more than 20 divisions, about 100,000 people. By the time they entered Shaanxi to suppress bandits, there were more guns than soldiers, with only about 2,000 people in each division, so the actual strength was only more than 5 divisions. (3) The people of the Northeast unanimously support Chairman Chiang and condemn Zhang's rebellion. Zang is from the Northeast, so he knows the real situation in the Northeast in detail. Finally, it was decided that the Municipal and County Party Headquarters, the County Chamber of Commerce, the Education Association, the General Labor Union, and the Farmers' Association would telegraph the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Military Affairs Commission, requesting the central government to launch a large-scale punitive expedition and hoping that the Northeastern compatriots in Guannei would clearly express their views to urge him to awaken as soon as possible to correct people's hearts and that the central government's strategy should be followed in the battle of Sui Bei to support it strongly and not to relax in the slightest. At the same time, all secondary schools and above in the county also telegraphed the central government requesting the punishment of Zhang.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>

Matters relating to the security of the city and suburbs are the responsibility of the Joint Military and Police Supervisory Office.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>

<p>Jinan Defeats Chihchih</p>
<p>The Jinan and Chihchih teams are both one of the five heroes in Group A of the Tiecheng Cup. Yesterday, Wang Nanzhen of Jinan did not play, but the performance was already tense enough. Chihchih's connection was very good, but the action was a bit hasty. In terms of personal skills, Liang Yunming's performance was not bad. Yao Ya of Jinan and Cai Yanxiong flew all over the court, and the performance was very wonderful. Chihchih's guards did their best, so Jinan scored with long throws. Yesterday, they won by three points. According to the form analysis, the two teams may have another chance to fight. Therefore, the championship of this Group A, Fudan, Xin Team Wu Long, Chihchih, and Jinan all have the idea of asking for it. The competition among the five strong teams will definitely have new tricks.</p>
<p>First half At the beginning of the game, the two teams fought fiercely for a long time. Three minutes later, Chihchih's Wang Jincheng missed a free throw opportunity. Liang Yunming showed his hand and the record was opened. Then Su Yinghai made a free throw and Liang Yunming added to the cake. Chihchih took the lead with five points. It was the most smoothly for Chihchih last night. After that, Jinan counterattacked. Cai Yanxiong took advantage of his busy schedule and scored two points. Wen Qiyuan was thrifty and each of them made a long throw. Su Yinghai made another free throw, creating a 6-6 tie. Chihchih's Liang Yunming received a long pass and stole the camp. Wen Qiyao missed the ring and Kuang Yao Ya took the opportunity and made another tie. Chen Xuechong became angry and broke through the siege under close guard, and both of the two yuan were successful. Cai Yanxiong and Wen Qiyao made 11-11 draw after chasing after throws and penalties, and the situation was tense. Finally, Jinan's situation took a sharp turn. Kuang Yao Ya, Zheng Jingan and Shi Wei surpassed by four points. Chihchih's Su Yinghai used his ingenuity to build a miracle, but in a blink of an eye, he was chased by Cai and Kuang. Wang Jincheng and Su Yinghai came again, and Liang was still pulled back by Zheng Jingan. The first half ended with Jinan taking the lead with 24-19.</p>
<p>Second half After lemon time (the two sides exchanged lines, Kuang started the record first, Wen Qiyao succeeded twice, Liang Wunming and Zhan Tingrui did not give way to each other, the record board was still five points apart. After a short break, Chihchih's Zhan Tingrui made a wonderful pass, and Zhang Liangxiong did not miss the opportunity. Just as the audience was applauding, Chihchih's defense was a little careless, and Cai Yanxiong stole the camp and entered. Xu Pei gritted his teeth, Kuang Yao Ya smiled happily, and each of them increased, still a difference of five points. Su Yinghai went to the sea again and reorganized his lineup. There were only six minutes left to the end of the game. The generals of Chihchih worked hard, and Su and Liang found opportunities to score. Kuang Yao Ya paid one point, and the difference was only two points. The competition between the two sides became more intense. In the end, it was still Xiao Kuang who made the throw, but time did not allow me to hit the gong to end the game. Jinan won by thirty-seven to thirty-three, which was also dangerous.</p>

<h3>West Youth Basketball Last Night; Xintong Defeats Mailing B</h3>
<p>The West Youth basketball had two makeup games last night. As a result, the game between Fudan and Nanjin in the University Group was postponed again due to some reason. Only the independent group Xintong vs. Mailing B faced off. Xintong started with too much contempt for the enemy, and Mailing B took the lead with a score of 5 to 4. Afterwards, both sides were flustered, resulting in inaccurate throws. Finally, because Xintong's skills were better, it still took the lead with a score of 10 to 7 in the first half. After the rematch, Mailing struggled to catch up, and the score was close. In the middle, it once surpassed with a score of 18 to 16. Xintong was in danger of being threatened.

<h3>Our Country's Wrestler Huang Bochang to Fight Pihafan Again At 8:30 PM on the 22nd Still at the Saint George Garden</h3>

<p>In the third week of the Shanghai Amateur Bullet Shooting Group League, Bao Qiyun of the Third Zhongqing Association defeated Gai Laibao of the Business Group with a score of 300 to 184 yesterday. This afternoon at 5:30, Zhu Gongliang of the Second Zhongqing Association will play against Kerobe of the Business Group for the final game. The victory or defeat is irrelevant to the overall situation, because in the previous four games, Zhongqing has already won 288 points more than the Business Group.</p>
<p>Under the winning situation, Bao Qiyun did not perform any special performances. Only 21, 25, 22, and 23 shots exceeded twenty points.

The score soared. The Louvre players have been transferred repeatedly, so the tactics have not been consistent. 3. Minli Yaoguang, the skills of the two teams have been well trained, and the battle situation is very close. In the first half, Yaoguang took the lead with 8 to 2.

You, sir, bear the nation's heavy trust and are concerned about national affairs, which is naturally your duty. However, to insist on implementing your personal or partial political views, and even resort to means of coercing and detaining superiors, how can it be tolerated by the people of the country or understood by future generations? And how will you teach your subordinates? President Chiang is loyal and dedicated to the country. He would never undermine the law and discipline to grant your request, which would be unwise. National affairs should be carefully discussed and measures taken. You should rein in the horse at the cliff's edge. We earnestly hope that you will restore President Chiang's freedom and allow him to return to the capital to govern. Otherwise, the people of the nation have a very clear understanding and deeply love and support President Chiang. We hope you will carefully consider and think, so as to comfort the people's hopes."

<h3>An Overview of Shanghai Municipal Council Elementary Schools (8)</h3>
<p>— Special Report by This Newspaper, Investigation by Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>Sixteen. Guidance for Graduates</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Elementary Schools have been in operation for eight years now. The total number of graduates from each school and each class is over 700. Each school provides considerable guidance to the graduating classes while they are still in school and to the graduates after they leave school. At the beginning of each semester, each school organizes a graduate guidance committee, which is attended by the principal, the director of academic affairs, and the teachers responsible for the subjects of the graduating class. The graduate guidance committee provides considerable guidance on students' preparation for further education and employment in the graduating class, as well as on their work after leaving school. During each semester, the Chinese Education Department will also send a letter to the China Vocational Education Society, inviting experts to give lectures to the graduating students of each school on guidance for further education and employment.</p>
<p>The majority of graduates from each school in the past have either pursued further education or found employment. Only a small number have remained idle at home. The Municipal Council specially established six scholarships (four for boys and two for girls) at the Municipal Council Chinese Boys' School starting in the 24th year of the Republic of China, specifically for graduates of the Municipal Council Elementary Schools who have excellent grades and are from poor families to compete for. Students who are admitted to this scholarship can have their tuition fees and stationery expenses waived, and study for three years in the junior high school department of the Municipal Council Chinese Boys' School or Girls' School. There are currently twelve graduates from poor families of the Municipal Council Elementary Schools who have been admitted to this scholarship and are studying at the Municipal Council Secondary School.</p>
<p>In addition, the Chinese Education Department and the faculty and staff of its affiliated elementary schools voluntarily donate a batch of funds each year for use as loan scholarships for poor graduates of each elementary school. Elementary school graduates who are from poor families but have excellent grades and are able to be admitted to public and private secondary schools in the city can apply to the Loan Scholarship Committee for a loan. The Loan Scholarship Committee reviews the academic performance and family situation of the students applying for the loan and can decide on the amount and term of the loan. The loan scholarship is limited to tuition fees and stipulates that students who receive the loan must repay it first after they graduate and find employment, so that it can continue to be loaned to subsequent graduates. In the past three years, a total of ten students have received loan scholarships and are studying at various secondary schools.</p>
<p>In the winter of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the Chinese Education Department guided graduates from each school to establish the Shanghai Municipal Council Elementary School Alumni Association. The purpose of the alumni association is to connect the feelings of graduates from each school and to assist the development of their alma mater. In terms of work, there are: holding member social gatherings, investigating the further education and employment status of alumni, publishing alumni association commemorative publications, etc. In recent years, the number of graduates from each school has increased year by year, the work of the alumni association has gradually expanded, and the alumni association headquarters has guided alumni from each school to separately establish alumni branch associations for each school, to jointly promote the affairs of the alumni association and assist the development of the alma mater's school affairs.

<h3>Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, and Qian Xinzhi Telegraph Zhang Yesterday: Willing to Go to Xi'an as Hostages, So That Mr. Chiang Can Safely Return to the Capital for Thorough Consideration</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Local Association, and Qian Xinzhi, Vice Chairman, jointly telegraphed Zhang Xueliang in Xi'an yesterday, saying, "To Mr. Zhang Xueliang of Xi'an: Since the incident occurred, the whole country has been alarmed and panicked for several days. This chaotic situation is neither what you are willing to see nor what you had anticipated. Xiaolai and others love the country and love you, sir. We are willing to go to Xi'an to receive your instructions and serve as hostages, so that Mr. Chiang can safely return to the capital for thorough consideration and save the country from danger. Xiaolai and others are willing to share the life of the nation. We sincerely express our words and eagerly await your orders." Respectfully, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Local Association, and Qian Xinzhi, Vice Chairman.</p>
<h3>Various Groups Wire the Central Government Requesting Military Action Against Zhang, Also Hoping Zhang Will Quickly Realize His Error and Obey the Central Government to Escort the Commander-in-Chief Back to Beijing</h3>
<p>Various groups in this city, previously having telegraphed Xi'an to advise Zhang Xueliang regarding his abduction of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, hoping he would repent, now, because Zhang has already betrayed the Party and the nation, recklessly defying the great disapproval of the world, specially telegraphed the central government and the National Government yesterday, requesting immediate military action to suppress him. The following are excerpts from various telegrams:</p>
<p>General Labor Union Telegram</p>
<p>"To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters and the National Government: Zhang Xueliang, a rebel, formerly a remnant of warlords, by taking advantage of the times, was able to remotely guard outside the Pass and hold sinecures in Beiping and Tianjin. He should have consolidated national defense and protected the territory. However, during the September 18th Incident, he was completely unprepared, retreating without a fight, causing the successive fall of the four northeastern provinces. The national situation has become increasingly perilous. Our central government still showed magnanimity, showing leniency and entrusting him with the heavy responsibility of suppressing bandits in the Northwest. Who would have thought that in the past two years, not only has he not achieved any merit to atone for his crimes, but he has also held back his troops, allowing the Red bandits to rampage and the people to suffer. If it is not due to incompetence and weakness, then he must have ulterior motives. Now that the bandits and pseudo-regimes are causing chaos in Suiyuan, the central government is fully engaged in suppressing them, and the people of the whole country are also rising up like a storm, acting as the rear support for the national army. Previous Qian Zheng's repeated reports of victory have arrived, but Zhang's rebellion has suddenly taken the action of threatening Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and disturbing the rear, committing treason and rebellion, betraying the Party and the nation, and recklessly defying the great disapproval of the world, already behaving like wild beasts, intolerable under national law. Furthermore, he advocates accommodating the Communists, attempting to redden China, and plunging it into a state of class struggle, making him even more of a great enemy of national revival. More than 800,000 workers in Shanghai vow not to coexist with this villain. We humbly request that you quickly issue a clear order to denounce his crimes and launch a punitive expedition, rescue our leader, eliminate that ferocious villain, and all workers will wholeheartedly support you. The Shanghai General Labor Union et al. respectfully bow."</p>
<p>City Farmers' Association Telegram</p>
<p>"Urgent, To the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the National Government: For more than twenty years in China, internal turmoil and foreign invasion have occurred incessantly, the nation is in danger, and the common people are suffering. Fortunately, our Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, leading a division of troops, has purged the warlords, extinguished the Red flames, eliminated the reactionaries, and laid the foundation for the nation. In recent years, he has especially devoted himself to spiritual and material construction, strengthening national defense and diplomacy, working hard and making great achievements. His worries and travels have left him with white hair, embodying the spirit of loyalty, integrity, bravery, sacrifice, and struggle. Not only is he loved and respected by the people of the whole country, but he is also praised by European and American scholars. Just as we were expecting to unite to resist foreign aggression, work hard to strengthen ourselves, and move towards the path of revival, unexpectedly, Zhang Xueliang, at the critical moment of resisting the enemy in Suiyuan, harbored evil intentions and brewed a change, openly detaining our highest leader, and furthermore, recklessly advocating accommodating the Communists, undermining national policy, providing enemies with opportunities, disrupting the military secrets of the front lines, disregarding discipline, and shaking the foundation of the nation. His crimes are truly worse than those of bandits. If this villain is not killed, there will be endless troubles in the future. Therefore, we earnestly request that you quickly order the troops near Shaanxi to march double-time to suppress him, quickly rescue the leader from danger, and do not allow the situation to spread. We cannot express our urgent anticipation of your orders. The Shanghai City Farmers' Association and various district farmers' associations respectfully bow."</p>
<p>Military Training Students' Telegram</p>
<p>"The military training students and trained citizens of this city jointly issued a telegram denouncing Zhang, saying: To all military training students and trained citizens in provinces and cities across the country: Our country is unfortunate, disasters and turmoil occur frequently, internal worries and foreign invasions multiply without ceasing. Our Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has endured hardship and made outstanding achievements, laboriously creating a situation of national unification for more than ten years, working tirelessly day and night. All of our compatriots admire him like the sun and the moon, and cherish him like a loving mother. However, Zhang Xueliang, a rebel, is fond of creating chaos, with the heart of a wild beast, and dared to raise troops to rebel against the country, detaining the commander-in-chief in Xi'an. When the news spread, both humans and gods were indignant. We have investigated Zhang's major crimes of betraying his country and humiliating the nation, making him the surviving object of national condemnation. He should have been subjected to clear legal punishment and thrown to the wolves. Our central government showed magnanimity and ordered him to perform meritorious service to atone for his past sins. If this rebel had any conscience, how could he not be grateful and encourage himself to repay the Party and the nation? However, at the beginning of national unification, he took this retrograde action, harming the country and the people to such an extreme. We and others belong to the nation and have the responsibility to save the country. At the beginning of the incident, we swallowed our anger, thinking that the rebel had temporarily lost his mind and taken this reckless action, hoping that he would wake up after the event and escort the chairman back to Beijing. Now, five days have passed, and he still does not know to repent. The entire country is increasingly indignant. We deeply believe that the chairman has made great contributions to the Party and the nation. All of us trained citizens have benefited from his influence and protection, allowing us to live and work in peace, with an obligation as great as heaven and earth. The training students have even been personally taught and instructed by him, with ear-to-ear instructions and patient guidance, no different from a loving mother. How can we sit idly by when his kindness is so great? Now that our central government has issued an order to suppress him and specially appointed ministers and commanders to directly attack the rebel's lair, all trained citizens and military training students in this city are willing to act as the rear support, carrying weapons and provisions, awaiting orders to go west to welcome and protect the chairman. If the chairman lives, we will live; if the chairman dies, we will die. We vow to shed the hot blood of 25,000 people to eliminate this national traitor. We sincerely hope that all military training students and citizens across the country will unanimously support us, uphold justice together, and maintain the foundation of the nation. In the face of this urgent telegram, we are filled with grief and indignation. We hope you will take note. Signed, 25,000 military training students and trained citizens of Shanghai, respectfully bow, Qi."</p>
<p>Two Railway Unions</p>
<p>"Again, a telegram to Zhang Xueliang in Xi'an: Honorable Mr. Zhang Hanqing of Xi'an, your consideration is requested regarding our telegram sent in the cold weather. All circles throughout the country have unanimously telegraphed, requesting you to rein in at the edge of the cliff and escort Chairman Chiang Kai-shek back to Beijing. No matter what your proposals are, you should obey the central government and plan comprehensively. Our advice to you is for the survival of our Chinese nation and also for your future. However, you have disregarded the interests and clung to your errors, stubbornly holding to your dissenting views and willingly acting as the leader of the rebellion. You are not only intolerable to the entire country but will also become a sinner for all time. The chairman is the leader of the entire country, and his spirit and policies are deeply rooted in the people of the whole country. How can you arbitrarily detain him? The 450 million people have already shared a deep sense of grief and indignation and vowed to quell the national crisis. We still hope that you will quickly realize your error, escort the chairman back to Beijing, and know that it is not too late to correct your mistakes. Seeing benevolence and seeing wisdom are both up to you to consider. Our painful plea is laid out before you, we hope you will take it into consideration. The Railway Unions directly under the Ministry of Railways, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, respectfully bow."</p>
<p>Lawyers' Association Telegram</p>
<p>"To Mr. Zhang Hanqing of Xi'an: At this time of serious national crisis, with the Suiyuan war urgent, just when the whole country is united to resist foreign aggression, you suddenly detained the commander-in-chief and arbitrarily made political demands, which has shocked everyone who heard of it. You have always taken restoring your father's revenge and returning to the Northeast as your duty. You should obey the central government and be loyal to your duty. However, you have now taken this action, no less than giving the enemy an opportunity and cutting yourself off from the people of the country. If the foundation of the country is shaken because of this, you will be cursed for eternity, which is not something you can bear. We urgently hope that you will prioritize the nation and the people, immediately restore Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's freedom, and all opinions and demands can be submitted to the central government through proper channels. We hope you will not stubbornly persist in your errors and fall into ruin. We offer our humble sincerity, hoping you will accept it. The Shanghai Lawyers' Association respectfully bows."</p>
<p>Accountants' Association Telegram</p>
<p>"To the National Government in Nanjing and Commander-in-Chief He of the rebel army: Zhang Xueliang's abduction of the commander-in-chief and his rebellious betrayal of the country are obvious crimes that make everyone's hair stand on end. Our government has already issued a clear order to suppress him, which has slightly comforted the public. We earnestly request that Commander-in-Chief He quickly command the national army to sweep away the rebellious atmosphere. At the same time, we also pray that you will rescue Chairman Chiang Kai-shek from danger to stabilize the people's hearts and maintain the foundation of the nation. We are very fortunate and pray fervently. The National Association of Accountants, the Shanghai Certified Public Accountants Association, the Nanjing Certified Public Accountants Association, and the Zhejiang Provincial Certified Public Accountants Association respectfully bow."</p>
<p>Various Native Place Associations Telegram</p>
<p>"The Da Gong She states: The 63 native place associations in the city, including Shaoxing and Baoshan, yesterday submitted a telegram to the central government regarding the Xi'an Incident, saying: To the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Military Affairs Commission, and the heads of various ministries and commissions: Recalling that Zhang Xueliang retreated without a fight during the September 18th Incident, losing territory, he had long been despised by the people of the country. The government was lenient towards his past actions, and the people of the country hoped that he would reflect on his actions and still entrusted him with important responsibilities, observing his subsequent effects. How should he strive to repay the country to atone for his past sins? However, now, at the time when the bloody battle to resist foreign aggression and suppress bandits on the border is about to be cleared, he suddenly abducted our country's only leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in Xi'an, betraying the country and the Party, undermining national policy, and acting insane, similar to bandits, harming the foundation of the country. Nothing could be worse. Fortunately, our central authorities made a solemn decision, and the traitor has been subjected to dismissal. According to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's established policy, we will actively suppress bandits and resist foreign aggression. Our associations have long been influenced by the Three Principles of the People, and we vow to devote ourselves to the national revolution, love the country, protect the Party, obey the leader, and never waver from the beginning to the end. Regarding this major change, we absolutely support the central government's decision. We only hope that all the gentlemen of the central government will gather their energy and work together to rescue Chiang Kai-shek from danger as soon as possible, so that he can still freely exercise his powers and continue to lead the country in suppressing bandits and resisting foreign aggression. We pray for victory. In the face of this urgent telegram, we are filled with grief and indignation. We only hope you will take note. The 63 Shanghai native place associations, including Shaoxing, Shangyu, Baoshan, Yangzhou, Nantong, Rugao, Zhenhai, Tongru, Chongming, Huining, Changshu, Anhui, and Shandong, respectfully bow."</p>
<p>Northeast Fellow Townsmen Telegram</p>
<p>"The Shen Shi She states: Zhang Xinjie and more than 180 fellow townsmen from the Northeast residing in Shanghai yesterday telegraphed Zhang Xueliang in Xi'an, saying: Honorable Mr. Zhang Hanqing of Xi'an, you guarded the Northeast, but the Northeast was lost; you suppressed the Red bandits, but the Red bandits increased. Now, you have intensified your actions, colluding with the Communist bandits and abducting the commander-in-chief. Is it because you think it is not enough that the Northeast has been newly lost, and you must destroy our entire nation before you are satisfied? If you have any conscience, you should have killed yourself to atone for your sins on the day the Northeast was lost. However, you did not die, shamelessly living on, and still do not know to endure hardship and humiliation to avenge your father and avenge national humiliation. You are truly a heartless person. At this time when the national situation is in danger and the powerful enemy has not been driven out, you suddenly took this action. If it was truly due to an impulsive outburst of passion, it is still excusable. Reining in at the edge of the cliff is not too late. If you truly do not want to be Wu Yuan and are willing to be Qin Hui, stubbornly persisting in your errors, then you will inevitably end up ruined and discredited, leaving a bad name for ten thousand years. Not only will we fellow townsmen feel pain and regret, but even your ancestors will surely weep in the underworld. The Red bandits are cunning and treacherous, and they are good at sowing discord. We hope you will not be fooled by them. Turning back is the shore. We hope you will think it over carefully. In the face of this urgent telegram, we are filled with anticipation. Signed, Zhang Xinjie, Ren Zhaotong, Zhang Datong, and more than 180 fellow townsmen from the Northeast residing in Shanghai, respectfully bow."</p>
<p>Silk and Satin Associations Telegram</p>
<p>"The Joint Association of Silk and Satin Weaving in Jiangsu and Zhejiang yesterday telegraphed Zhang Hanqing in Xi'an, saying: Honorable Mr. Zhang Hanqing of Xi'an, at this time when the bandits and pseudo-regimes in Suiyuan are causing trouble, the national army is meeting them head-on with heavy blows, and the whole country is united to resist foreign aggression, suddenly your troops rebelled and abducted the commander-in-chief and senior generals, causing the people to feel indignant and heartbroken and giving the enemy an opportunity to exploit, harming the country and the people. Nothing could be worse. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is the only leader who is leading the revival of the motherland and completing national unification. Not only is he loved and respected by the people, but he is also respected by countries all over the world. His achievements are brilliant and outstanding throughout the ages. He carries the safety of the Chinese nation on his shoulders. How can he act rashly and cause harm to the Party and the nation? We humbly implore you to follow the will of the people and quickly escort the chairman out of danger and return to Beijing to govern, so as to save the nation from disaster and protect the nation. We cannot express our urgent anticipation. The Joint Association of Silk and Satin Weaving in Jiangsu and Zhejiang respectfully bows."</p>
<h3>The China National Products Maintenance Association Issued Two Important Telegrams Yesterday</h3>

Our association, in addition to sending a special telegram to Mr. Zhang Hanqing in Xi'an on a cold day, asking him to repent and restore the chairman's freedom, listen to the central government's arrangements, and be careful not to harm the national strength and isolate himself from the people of the country, the bandits and pseudo-regimes have invaded Suiyuan. Fortunately, you and Chairman Fu Zuoyi have planned and made decisions, launched a large-scale attack, and captured famous areas repeatedly, with frequent reports of victory. The news has spread and everyone is excited. At this critical moment, we hope that you will continue to work hard to eliminate these ugly creatures to save the nation from disaster and achieve complete success. We are deeply grateful."</p>
<p>Request to Fu to Intensify the Bandit Suppression Work</p>

The bandits and pseudo-regimes have invaded the border. Fortunately, you personally led the army to meet them head-on with heavy blows, winning repeatedly and capturing famous areas one after another. Your prestige has spread far and wide, and the ugly creatures are terrified. However, at this time of long-distance advance, there was suddenly a rebellion in Xi'an and the chairman was detained, which caused public outrage throughout the country and extreme heartache. Our association, in addition to sending a special telegram to Mr. Zhang Hanqing in Xi'an on a cold day, asking him to repent and restore the chairman's freedom, listen to the central government's arrangements, and be careful not to harm the national strength and isolate himself from the people of the country, at this critical moment of suppressing bandits, we hope that you will adhere to the established policy and launch a large-scale attack, striving to eliminate the ugly creatures as soon as possible to warn those ferocious villains and achieve complete success.

<h3>Special District Federation: Oppose Increased Donations, Letter Requesting Taxpayers' Association to Strive</h3>
<p>Liu Zhongying, Ge Futian, Gu Yucang, and other members of the First Special District Citizens' Federation jointly wrote to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, stating: We read in the newspaper that the Public Concession authorities, due to financial exhaustion, plan to increase the municipal donation by two percent from the next year to supplement their funds. We were shocked by this. In recent years, affected by the economic downturn, the market has been in extreme decline. Industrial, commercial, and residential households already feel overwhelmed by the existing rent and taxes. If further exorbitant taxes are imposed, they will be driven to desperation, and the future will be unbearable to contemplate. It will also inevitably have a negative impact on social order. We cannot remain silent and propose that your association, while the Public Works Department is still undecided, consider the suffering of taxpayers, argue reasonably, negotiate for a stop to this, then the market will be fortunate, and social order will be fortunate.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Actively Plans to Restore Shipping on the Upper Yangtze</h3>
<p>The development of shipping on the Yangtze River this year is unprecedented since the founding of the Republic of China, and the sharp decline in water levels is also unprecedented. The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, in order to remedy the future and restore transportation on the upper Yangtze, plans to build new Yangtze River ships and add steam-powered ships, and rebuild the new Emei ship. This has now been approved by the Ministry and ordered to proceed quickly. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Building the New Emei</p>
<p>The Emei ship of the company has a load capacity of 1077 tons, a length of 202 feet 5 inches, a width of 31 feet, a fully loaded draft of 8 feet, and an empty ship draft of only 1 foot 8 inches to 5 feet 8 inches. It can travel at a speed of 13 nautical miles per hour. It originally sailed on the Sichuan River and was the crown of all ships. Since the accident, more than three years have passed. The Emei was rescued and returned to Shanghai, only to be left to languish. The Sichuan River shipping route of the company has been interrupted for a long time. Recently, the goods on this route have been congested, and freight rates have soared, increasing eightfold compared to the past. Therefore, the business losses are incalculable. This year, the company's plan to repair the Emei ship has been going on for several months. The entire hull needs to be completely rebuilt and replaced with new steel plates. Only the internal machinery can still be used. After bidding by various shipyards, the cost is estimated to be between 350,000 and 400,000 yuan. After repeated negotiations between the company and the Jiangnan Shipyard, it was finally agreed that the shipyard would build the new Emei ship hull for 320,000 yuan. The payment method was agreed to be paid in installments, with 10,000 yuan paid per month, to be paid off in 32 months. According to the shipyard, the company should provide interest subsidies, but the company requested the shipyard to waive it. This major issue is unlikely to be a problem. The company has already submitted a request to the Ministry for approval to expedite the construction.</p>
<p>Adding Steam-Powered Ships</p>
<p>There is still a balance of 800,000 yuan from the Boxer Indemnity, which is sufficient to build a new Yangtze River ship. The drawings have already been prepared. It is the latest type of Yangtze River ship that can navigate through both flood and low water levels. Also, this year, the Hankou-Yichang route in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the Hunan route have seen abundant harvests and a large number of downstream goods, while the upstream goods are also congested. The middle and upper Yangtze shipping routes of Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Sanbei, Nissin, and Minsheng are all very developed. China Merchants is falling behind with only one Kuaili ship. Therefore, it has been decided to add a flat-bottomed, shallow-water middle and upper Yangtze ship with a capacity of 800 tons, specializing in cargo and not emphasizing passenger space, and using a steam engine. The drawings have also been sent to the Ministry for approval, and the company has been ordered to quickly contact Jiangshang Shipyard to undertake the construction.</p>

The Bank Association is scheduled to hold a regular member meeting on the afternoon of the 29th to report on the association's work in the second half of the year and pass the budget and final accounts. (2) The closing of accounts in the money industry has always been handled in accordance with the industry and commerce, annually at the Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and the end of the year according to the lunar calendar. This year, it has been resolved by the public meeting to change to settling accounts once at the end of the Gregorian calendar year. After the resolution, each firm has begun to prepare. The Money Industry Association has also scheduled an executive committee meeting and a winter meeting of managers of each firm for the afternoon of the 20th to discuss business reforms.</p>

<h3>November Exports to the U.S. Still Increased</h3>
<p>Exceeding $38,339</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai, the statistics for goods exported from Shanghai to the United States in November are as follows: Animal Food Products (meat and other foods, such as poultry and eggs): $103,052; Animal Non-Food Products: $319,907; Vegetables and Beverages (including vegetable oils and cocoa, coffee, tea): $43,000; Vegetables (Non-Food, including medicinal herbs, oil seeds, dyes, etc.): $100,984; Textiles (including raw and manufactured cotton, jute, wool, hair): $945,438; Wood and Paper: $380; Non-Metallic Minerals (including glass, pottery, stones, etc.): $19,781; Metallic Minerals (excluding machinery and vehicles): $160,672; Machinery and Vehicles: No exports; Chemicals (including pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, and soaps, etc.): $68.67; Miscellaneous Goods: $1,032. Total: $1,702,012. The total for the previous month (October) was $1,663,673. Therefore, the November exports exceeded the October exports by $38,339. Despite the U.S. maritime workers' strike, Shanghai's exports were not only unaffected, but also exceeded the previous month's exports. The reason for this is that the ships sailing from Shanghai to the United States were still operating as usual. However, this month (December) may be affected. From January to November of this year, the total value of goods exported from Shanghai to the United States was $17,860,969.</p>
<h3>Expert Sent by the National Economic Council, Xu Kai, to Go Abroad on Schedule</h3>
<p>The National Economic Council is sending experts to Geneva for observation.

Mr. Hu has already set off by ship on the 1st of this month. Mr. Xu and Mr. Zhang remained in China because their domestic affairs had not been completed. It is now known that Mr. Xu arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning and is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 23rd on the German ship Scharnhorst to Germany and will go to Geneva for observation. Mr. Zhang is scheduled to depart in January next year. Mr. Xu's observation task is water conservancy, and the period is six months. Mr. Zhang's task is cooperation, it is said.</p>
<h3>Six Companies and Customs Brokerage Firms Joint Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Discussing Yangtze River Freight Water Fees</p>
<p>The Shanghai Transshipment and Customs Brokerage Industry Association, in opposition to the six companies including the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, implementing water fee collection based on weight, specially convened representatives of various trades related to the Yangtze River yesterday to discuss countermeasures, and sent a letter to the Steamship Industry Association to uphold the transportation of domestic goods. The six companies will hold another meeting this afternoon, and have invited the Customs Brokerage Association to participate. Details of the situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Yangtze River Group Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the Transshipment and Customs Brokerage Industry Association convened a meeting of members of the Yangtze River group to discuss striving for the cancellation of water fee collection based on weight and to conduct comprehensive research. They immediately appointed Chen Jinjun, Chairman of the Industry Association, and Han Yutian, Chuan Zaichen, Yang Ziqing, Zhan Taifeng, Yin Zhiyun, and Xu Zhiqing as representatives, and Wu Yongxia was recommended by the Shanghai Commercial Association of the Hakka community to attend the joint meeting of the six companies.</p>
<p>Letter to the Steamship Association</p>
<p>The Transshipment and Customs Brokerage Industry Association sent a letter to the Steamship Industry Association yesterday, stating, "Dear Sirs, concerning the previous declaration published by members of our association, stating that starting from December 15th, all goods transported to various ports along the Yangtze River, with water fees collected based on weight, must be collected according to the scales of the Pingzhun Company, etc. After members of our association's Yangtze River group read this, they immediately came to the association requesting an emergency meeting of various trades in the Yangtze River group. Consequently, a resolution was made to dispatch seven representatives to contact various companies, and simultaneously, our association sent letters to the six companies, requesting them to cancel the previous resolution. At the same time, we received two letters from the Shanghai Commercial Association of the Hakka community, resolutely opposing and requesting that we forward them to various companies for the cancellation of the resolution. All of these have been forwarded previously. Up until Monday of this week, we received a reply from the six companies, indicating that the previous resolution could not be canceled. Furthermore, the representatives appointed by our association also went to various companies to negotiate, but only received a promise to hold a meeting for discussion on Wednesday of this week. The representatives still did not obtain a satisfactory outcome, and with the date agreed upon by the six companies approaching, we have no choice but to prepare countermeasures in advance to deal with the situation. We immediately convened a joint meeting of members of the Shanghai Commercial Association of the Hakka community and resolved to publish a public notice first (see advertisement). This is the entire situation of this case. Calculating water fees for heavy goods based on the weight calculated by customs for tax payment is fair and reasonable in every aspect. However, the sudden introduction of a new rule by the six companies inevitably causes unnecessary disturbances. Moreover, the Hakka community has a long-standing practice of transporting goods. A sudden change will drastically increase losses in freight costs, which is difficult to accept. Our industry's agency for reporting and transportation is a minor matter, while the Hakka community's reporting, transportation, and packaging are major matters. Since the six companies have replied that they will hold a meeting for discussion on Wednesday, we specially present this letter detailing the entire situation to you, hoping that your association will inform your members and the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to propose the cancellation of the new resolution at the meeting, in order to take into account the interests and sentiments of both parties and the spirit of cooperation among Chinese merchants. We would be extremely grateful and hope to receive a reply."</p>
<p>Six Companies Meeting</p>
<p>The six Yangtze River water fee public sharing companies, including the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, private companies, Sanbei, Ning Shao, British Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Japanese Nisshin, held a meeting the day before yesterday. As no concrete solution was reached, they scheduled a second meeting to be held today at 3:00 PM at the Shipping Club, and invited representatives from the Transshipment and Customs Brokerage Industry Association and the Commercial Association to attend and jointly discuss a solution.</p>
<h3>China International Famine Relief Commission Report on the Yichuan Drought Disaster</h3>
<p>Henan Province is suffering from a severe drought, with tragic conditions. Yichuan is one of the most severely affected disaster areas. The Yichuan County Drought Relief Association, having learned that the China International Famine Relief Commission at 505 Henan Road in this city has always been known for its efforts in disaster relief, especially focusing on well-drilling, dike repair, river dredging, and road construction for disaster prevention, and has achieved significant results in work relief, requested the commission to allocate funds for emergency relief and submitted a plan to carry out well-drilling, river dredging, and dike repair work relief projects in the county. It is reported that the commission intends to convene executive committee members to hold a meeting for discussion and send personnel for investigation before making a decision. The original letter is excerpted as follows: "Our county has suffered from disasters for years, and farmers have long been without savings. Since May of this year, a severe drought has wreaked havoc, with no rainfall at all. Trees have withered, farmland has cracked, and the autumn harvest has yielded nothing. Winter wheat has also not been sown. In some areas along the Yi River, the grains have sprouted, but they have been completely eaten by black insects. People have nothing to eat and are peeling tree roots and grass for sustenance. All furniture and clothing have long been pawned or sold. Selling sons and daughters to temporarily maintain life is even more common. Now, in the depth of winter, in addition to hunger, there is also the cold. Disaster victims are crying and wailing, which is unbearable to hear. The old and weak are dying in ditches, and refugees are everywhere. We must find ways to rescue them. Although the local authorities and charitable organizations have allocated grain for relief, the amount is too small to meet the needs and is like a drop in the bucket. We have always admired your commission's compassion and concern for the hungry and drowning. Seeing this tragic situation, we hope you will show mercy. We specially request that you allocate funds to carry out emergency relief to save these dying people and provide work relief by organizing three projects: well-drilling, river dredging, and dike repair, to plan for the aftermath. We respectfully submit a project plan for your review and approval. We hope that you will send personnel to investigate and approve the implementation. Millions of disaster victims will be grateful for your great kindness and offer their tearful words. We ask for your consideration."</p>
<h3>Tenant Association Responds, Requesting Reassessment of Land Prices</h3>
<p>In Order to Revive the Market and Promote Prosperity</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tenant Association submitted a petition to the municipal government yesterday and also sent letters to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Municipal Council of the French Concession, requesting a prompt reduction in land prices to maintain the market. The original text is as follows: "It is noted that our country's economy is declining, and the market is withering. The prosperous Shanghai is no longer what it used to be. In addition, years of rural bankruptcy have severely damaged its vitality. The surface is prosperous, but the reality is empty. In this time of chaos and famine, all levels of society are striving to revive the economy in order to recover. However, the fundamental solution lies in increasing income and reducing expenditure, and increasing income depends on more blessings, while reducing expenditure is best achieved by reducing rent. It is observed that Shanghai's real estate industry has declined sharply due to the trend of the times. In October of this year, Mr. Peak, a member of the Housing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, was invited by the Real Estate Association to give a speech on "The Housing Problem in Shanghai," stating that there is a contradictory phenomenon in Shanghai's housing: residents are becoming increasingly crowded, while vacant houses are increasing in number. Based on the above two points, it is the weakness of social economic power. Citizens are outwardly strong but inwardly weak and unable to afford rent, resulting in several families renting one house and rows of vacant houses. The reason is that land prices are higher than the actual value, creating an obstacle to reducing rent. Although various parties have repeatedly appealed, the result is that the resistance is always stronger. Today, the Real Estate Association also has a request to reassess land prices and reduce taxes. The association believes that reassessing land prices and reducing rent is a key policy for reviving the market and alleviating people's livelihood. (Your Honor) (Your Bureau) presides over society and cares about people's livelihood. You cannot ignore this issue that affects the entire society and people's livelihood. Therefore, we humbly state the following situation, earnestly requesting that you consider the decline of Shanghai's commerce and the desolation of people's livelihood and promptly order the reassessment of land prices to reveal fairness, and set rent rates based on the cost of the property, reducing them uniformly so that they do not exceed the legal interest rate, so that the public is not biased and both landlords and tenants can live in peace. This matter concerns people's lives and is of utmost urgency. We respectfully submit this petition."</p>
<h3>Shanghai County</h3>
<p>Prohibition of Opium Propaganda</p>
<p>To Be Held in the Third District Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government, with the general opium prohibition inspection approaching, has followed orders to hold propaganda meetings in different districts starting from the day before yesterday. This afternoon at 2:00 PM, it will be held at the Third District Office in the new county seat. Beforehand, the district office will convene all township, village, and neighborhood chiefs, as well as representatives from all walks of life, to attend the meeting. In addition to the county government sending Zhu Changlin and Zhang Xueling to attend and deliver propaganda, standing committee members of the County Opium Prohibition Committee will also attend to provide guidance.</p>
<h3>Joint Transportation of Railways and Automobiles</h3>
<p>Contract Validity Period Uniformly Changed to Two Years</p>
<p>The passenger joint transportation contracts signed by the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway and the long-distance automobile companies and shipping companies along the line, previously formulated in two standard formats, have been submitted to the Ministry of Railways for record. Now, the Traffic Department, considering that the validity period stipulated in the joint transportation contracts is one year, which seems too short in practice, believes that these joint transportation contracts are based on factual needs and are established to expand business, benefiting both parties. Unless there are obstacles in the route or problems with the company, they are generally continued without changes. Repeatedly going through renewal procedures after the expiration date is quite troublesome. To reduce procedures for both parties, it is proposed that when signing or adding to these highway or waterway joint transportation contracts in the future, the validity period should be uniformly changed to two years, which has been approved by the Ministry of Railways upon submission by the bureau.</p>

<h3>Qingliang Temple's</h3>
<p>Appeal Against Seizure Results in High Court Ruling to Revoke Enforcement; Qingliang Temple Requests Court to Lift Seizure</p>
<p>Qingliang Chan Temple, one of Shanghai's four major monasteries, with its grand and magnificent architecture, was involved in a lawsuit with Tonghe Foreign Firm over relocation in the First Special Court. After three trials, Qingliang Temple lost all cases. Therefore, the case was already under enforcement and seizure. However, prominent figures from the temple's maintenance committee, such as Wang Yiting and Zhu Ziqiao, sent numerous telegrams to the Executive Yuan, Control Yuan, Ministry of Judicial Administration, and Supreme Court, requesting that the case files be reviewed.</p>
<p>To thoroughly investigate and provide relief, and because many discrepancies were found in the original judgment and the enforcement exceeded the scope, the temple's monk Qinghai initiated legal procedures. Regarding the implementation of enforcement, a lawsuit of objection to enforcement was filed with the Civil Court, and summons have been issued several times. It is scheduled to be continued on the 18th of this month. At the same time, an appeal against the enforcement order was filed with the Second High Court, which has now ruled that the enforcement is not allowed, revoked the original order, and ordered the first instance court to make a more appropriate disposition. The reasoning for the ruling includes that the original confirmed judgment in this case ordered the appellant to return the leased houses to Tonghe Foreign Firm. The number of the so-called leased houses was not specified. Although the original enforcement court sent personnel to investigate and reported that the appellant's temple had a total of 108 houses, 37 of which were owned by the creditor and are currently rented by the appellant, the subsequent text stated that the debtor claimed that these 37 houses were all rebuilt from old materials. The appellant also stated in writing after the original court issued the enforcement order that some of the houses were rebuilt from old materials purchased from the creditor, with receipts as proof, and some were completely built by the temple itself, all of which were not within the scope of enforcement, and this was clearly stated during the on-site inspection and in the case of objection to enforcement, requesting confirmation of property rights and a ruling that the houses owned by the appellant should not be subject to enforcement. Therefore, the appellant clearly disputed the number of houses leased. The enforcement court could only enforce the undisputed part, but the original confirmed judgment was unclear, and the appellant had already filed a lawsuit of objection, requesting confirmation. Before the lawsuit of objection is confirmed by judgment, the enforcement court has no room to directly determine and hastily enforce it. However, the original court, after the appellant filed the lawsuit of objection, resumed enforcement and seizure according to the previous order, limiting the appellant to vacate the houses, which, according to the above explanation, is difficult to be considered proper. The appellant's intention is not entirely without reason. Based on the above conclusion, this appeal is justified. According to Article 489, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Procedure Law, the ruling is made as stated in the main text. Since the Second High Court has ruled to revoke the original enforcement order, it is reported that the temple intends to request the enforcement court to lift the seizure immediately.</p>
<h3>Gu Zhuxuan Released on Bail,</h3>
<p>Court Sends Clerk to Verify Bail, Family Members and Disciples Wait at the Scene</p>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, the former dance hall owner from Yancheng, was arrested on suspicion of inciting the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, and two cases of bribing guards and instructing prisoners to retract confessions and instigating perjury occurred. Gu filed a petition with the Second Court of the Third High Court requesting suspension of detention and permission to post bail. The Second Court ruled that two solid shops providing a written guarantee of 20,000 yuan would be permitted to suspend detention, and the family members found Wanchang Rice Store and Xingxinchi Bathhouse to provide written guarantees. The procedures were completed the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the family members of Gu deposited cash and securities amounting to 70 yuan to the case with the Third High Court, and Yuyongxing South Goods and Tobacco Shop at 279 Albert Road and a certain manufacturer provided a written guarantee of 10,000 yuan and a written guarantee of responsibility to be available at any time. To prevent malpractice, the court specially sent a clerk to the two guarantor's homes to verify that there were no errors, and summoned the two guarantors to the court for questioning before approving the guarantee. After the procedures were completed, the Criminal Court of the Third High Court issued a release warrant to the Masnan Road Detention Center at 2:30 PM, ordering the release of Gu Zhuxuan. Gu's third brother, Gu Songmao, brother-in-law Zheng Jian, and lawyer Xue Dubi all went to the detention center to meet him. Gu's friends Zhao Ruquan, Zhao Junyu, lawyer Wu Qilun, and Gu's disciples were all waiting outside the detention center. At 3:20 PM, after completing the procedures inside the detention center, Gu was released from the detention center. Two family members helped him as he rushed to the car prepared by the family and drove straight back. It is reported that he first went to a hotel to rest and meet guests, and then bathed and offered incense. All the friends waiting nearby rushed forward to greet Gu as he came out of the detention center and followed him. It is estimated that Gu was detained for 15 months and eight days from the time he was arrested until he was released.</p>
<h3>Ascending the Himalayas,</h3>
<p>Yang Zedi Returns from Exploration, Taking One Year and Three Months</p>
<p>Chinese youth explorer Yang Zedi, accompanied by Romeo Amenji, set off from Shanghai to India in August of last year and proceeded towards the Geng area. However, near the Yilihuate River, one team member suddenly fell ill, and they had no choice but to temporarily end the trip. Later, after the team member recovered, they set off again, entered the foothills of the Himalayas in central Myanmar, and climbed the world-famous peak, reaching the summit of Nantadun (approximately 26,000 feet). They then traveled to Yunnan, encountering bandits several times along the way, but they managed to escape. After returning to the area where the Miao people gathered, they traveled to Kunming and took a Eurasian plane to Chengdu. He arrived in Shanghai by boat yesterday, taking approximately one year and three months for the entire journey. It is reported that the two Americans are both students at Harvard University.</p>
<h3>Xuan Sheng Mining Case</h3>
<p>Scheduled for Debate</p>
<p>The case of Mao Yonghu, Wang Zhensheng, Zhao Yunhong, Zhu Guisheng, Chen Enming, Jin Daoquan, and the women Wang Zai and Zhang Ma, who transported military supplies, in the assassination of Japanese national Xuan Ban Mine, has been prosecuted by the District Court. The Criminal Court has interrogated them twice. The case could have been concluded, but the defense lawyer requested further investigation of issues such as whether the evidence in the case, the handguns and bullets, matched and the report on the corpse, so the debate has not taken place. The case is now scheduled to be held in the debate court on the 22nd of this month for public debate. There will be a grand debate at that time.</p>
<h3>Shanghai</h3>

<h3>Two Dancers from the St. Anna</h3>
<p>Sued for Breach of Contract</p>
<p>Wang Xinhe Sues to Recover Damages</p>
<p>The famous dancer Niu Lulu, a 23-year-old native of Ningbo, lives at No. 4 Zhishan Lane, Jiaozhou Road. Qu Aifei, a 24-year-old local, lives at No. 267 Xiafei Road. On June 1st of this year, Niu and Qu both joined the St. Anna Dance Hall, opened by Wang Xinhe, a native of Minhou, at No. 80 Xieqiao Lane, as dance partners and signed a contract for a term of one year. Within the specified period, the cash earned by Niu and Qu would be subsidized by the dance hall with a 15% transportation fee. If they breached the contract midway, they would have to return all the subsidized fees and compensate the hall for damages of 1,000 yuan each. However, on September 15th, Niu and Qu suddenly stopped dancing at the St. Anna Dance Hall and went to work at other dance halls. Wang Xinhe repeatedly negotiated with them, but to no avail. The plaintiff then hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, requesting that Niu Lulu be ordered to repay the subsidized transportation fee of 154 yuan, 5 jiao, 7 fen, and 5 li, and the damages of 1,000 yuan, and that Qu Aifei repay the subsidized fee of 63 yuan, 7 jiao, 1 fen, and 2.5 li, and the damages of 1,000 yuan, and bear the litigation costs, according to Articles 1 and 3 of the contract. After the Special Court accepted the case and issued summons for the two defendants, it was found that Qu Aifei had moved, and the summons could not be served. Judge Luo Can once held a court session. Niu Lulu hired a lawyer to appear in court and requested a postponement, which was discussed and rescheduled to be heard again on January 13th. As for Qu Aifei's part, the plaintiff's lawyer requested a public service of summons.</p>
<h3>Robbers and Kidnappers</h3>
<p>Seven Men and Women Arrested</p>
<p>Acting on a tip received at 8:00 PM the night before last, Detective Zhong Da of the 6th Squad of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Criminal Investigation Brigade learned that robbers Chen Gongjian and Wang Jinbiao, who had robbed Tang Baoquan's house at the Shide Lane No. [illegible number] oil truck pier in Dongjiadu Xuejiabang Road, were hiding somewhere near Little World. Detective Zhong reported to Squad Leader Qian Tianxiong, who dispatched detectives Miao Yizhong, Wu Songshan, and Detective Liu, together with the original informant and eyewitness, to rush to the scene. They saw Chen taking a young girl out shopping and arrested them together. After being brought back to the team, the robber confessed that his name was Chen Gongjian, 34 years old, from Qingjiang, and lived at the Black Bridge Head, Fuyou Road, Little World. He directly admitted to robbing the Tang family at Shide Lane No. 5, Xuejiabang Road, of cash and gold bracelets, and receiving stolen goods worth 130 yuan. He also confessed that his accomplices were hiding in the concession. According to the girl, Wang Xiuying (also known as Little Old Han), 16 years old, from Haizhou, was abducted by robber Wang Jinbiao from a shed on Yulin Road, Huasheng Road, in the British Concession more than two months ago and lived with Chen Gongjian. Wang and others often raped her, and someone was currently negotiating a price of 400 yuan to sell her to Yantai, and she was being taken out for the buyer to see. After verifying the confession, the team immediately dispatched the original detectives, together with the Yulin Road police station, to the shed on Huasheng Road and arrested Wang Jinbiao. They then separately worked with the Dongjiadu police station, sending police officer No. 4627 and others, to arrest Zhou Shixiang, 24 years old, Wu Changyou, 36 years old, and Lu Guanchen, 48 years old, all from Taizhou, who were arrested at Xiechang Lane and the garbage pond in Yangjiadu, Pudong.

<h3>The Avenel Road Robbery Case</h3>
<p>The Arrested Robbers Were Interrogated Yesterday; The Victim Testified in Court That the Two Robbers Had Confessed; The Deceased Robber Was Autopsied by the Court Yesterday and No Family Members Were Found</p>
<p>The Yongtai cigarette and paper shop, opened by Lu Xishi, a woman from Shaoxing, at No. 534 Avenel Road, was suddenly invaded by four robbers, Tian Linchang, Wang Acai, Zhou Jiangjiang, and Yang Changgeng, all from Ningbo, at around 6:00 AM the day before yesterday. They threatened the shop assistants with pistols and robbed them of 342 French currency. As they left the shop with the stolen goods, shop assistant Chen Arong followed them and saw the four robbers enter the small cigarette and paper shop opened by Jin Shusheng, a native of Shaoxing, at No. 2, Lane 762, Chengdu Road. He reported to Chinese police officer No. 3305, who relayed the information to the police station by telephone. The police chief, upon hearing the alarm, immediately ordered West Inspector Bao Tai, Wilkes, and patrol inspectors Tao Rubi and Wang Shidong, all armed, to proceed to the scene. Upon arriving at No. 2, due to the extreme darkness in the shop, they called out the shop owner Jin Shusheng and asked if any robbers had fled into the shop. Jin and others replied in the negative. The Chinese and Western inspectors, knowing that the robbers were hiding in the inner room, ordered the robbers to come out. However, the robbers inside refused, saying that they would not surrender unless they opened fire. After speaking, they fired a shot first to resist arrest. The two Chinese inspectors then drew their pistols and fired back, immediately rushing in. They saw one robber (Zhou Jiangjiang, 38 years old, from Chaozhou) lying dead in a pool of blood with a bullet in his left forehead. A pistol, four bullets, and one shell casing were found next to him, as well as 39 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen in stolen money. At that time, Tian Linchang fled into the adjacent room, No. 760, and jumped out of the window, but was captured by a patrol officer. Robber Wang Acai was arrested in the bed at No. 760, and a pistol containing five bullets, a bayonet, 24 large and small silver yuan, and two cans of cigarettes were found in the toilet. Jin Shusheng, the suspect, and Zhou Lishi, a woman from Suzhou and mistress of the deceased Zhou Jiangjiang, and her 13-year-old daughter Zhou Gendi were all taken to the police station. Another criminal, Yang Changgeng, escaped. The body of the deceased Zhou Jiangjiang was sent to the autopsy office to await examination. Yesterday morning, the police station transferred the five men and women arrested to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted Tian and Wang according to Article 330 of the Criminal Law for robbery. As for Jin Shusheng, Zhou Lishi, and Zhou Gendi, he requested detention and presented the above situation, requesting a rescheduling. The victim Lu Xishi testified that Tian and Wang were indeed the robbers who robbed her shop at the time. Although I begged them on my knees, they refused to give back the money. Now that I have been robbed clean, I cannot continue to do business. I request that they be brought to justice. When questioned, the two defendants, Tian and Wang, admitted to the robbery. Jin Shusheng and the other three denied having any connection with the robbers. Judge Huang instructed the defendants to be detained and rescheduled for a hearing in seven days. Prosecutor Zhang, delegated by the prosecutor's office, arrived at the office to verify that Zhou Jiangjiang had indeed died from a gunshot wound while alive. No family members were found, and the body was handed over to Pushan Villa for burial.</p>

<p>Li Guojie, the former General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, mortgaged the four warehouses to the China 영업 Company without authorization.

The Ministry of Transportation reported this, and Li Guojie was sentenced to eight months in prison for embezzlement with a two-year reprieve. The private suit portion involves over 1.2 million yuan in principal and interest. When the case was in the Civil Execution Court of the Local Court, Li Sihao and Yu Qiaqing posted bail.

The court ordered Li to provide assets, but there was no response. During the continued execution process, Li was ordered to accompany the coffin of the late Duan Zhizheng to the north, postponing the hearing.

<h3>Dollar Pacific Line Still Running as Usual</h3>
<p>Yokohama Telegraph Completely Inaccurate</p>
<p>On the 12th of this month, all newspapers in this city reported a telegraph from Yokohama on the 11th from the Allied News Agency, stating that the American Dollar Steamship Company would suspend the Pacific route due to the impact of the global economic downturn in recent years and the recent major strike by American seamen. According to news from the Dollar Company in this city, the company was very surprised after seeing the report. An urgent telegram was sent to the Dollar General Company in San Francisco and the Dollar Branch Company in Yokohama, both of which replied that this was not the case. The company also said that the news that "the Kobe branch will be closed soon and entrusted to the U.S. Wheel Company in Kobe as an agent next spring" is completely inconsistent with the facts. Because the Dollar Shipping Company in this city is the general company in the East, how can the branch company be closed without the general company knowing? Furthermore, there is no so-called U.S. Wheel Company in Kobe. Finally, the company also said that after the seamen's strike ends in the future, the Dollar route will remain the same. All the news transmitted by the Allied News Agency in Yokohama this time may be a misreport.</p>

It is heard that this special price was requested by Shanghai Jingyi Wood Company to the railway for a one-year trial. Now, the two railways believe that the trial has been ineffective, so the special price was cancelled in advance on December 7.</p>

<p>The Yinse, Xiang Sheng, and Yunfei rental car companies have always given gifts with each book of discount coupons, in addition to selling the discount coupons at a reduced price.

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Respectfully, we are writing on behalf of our client, Mr. Xu Xueseng, who stated that upon reading a news item in the "Local News" section of yesterday's Shen Bao, titled "Xu Xueseng Sues Zhu Guanghan for Instigating Assault," several details mentioned therein do not accurately reflect the facts. We hereby request corrections, detailed as follows: 1. The case was summoned by the District Court, initially questioned by Judge Shao Qinzhi, not Judge Wu Deying. This is the first correction. 2. Xu Xueseng's lawsuit against Zhu Guanghan is limited to the criminal portion, without any civil suit attached. The statement of an attached private suit for 100,000 yuan is not factual. This is the second correction. 3. Throughout the repeated summonses for the case, the defendant Zhu Guanghan has never filed a countersuit of false accusation. The allegations of attempted fraud due to a failed loan are baseless. This is the third correction. 4. During the hearing on the afternoon of the 16th of this month, because Gu Changyuan, the lawyer entrusted by Zhu Guanghan, was suspected of another crime, he was prosecuted by the Prosecutor's Office. Therefore, Zhu Guanghan was ordered to not only be released on bail with the original 5,000 yuan in cash, but also to find a reputable shop as a written guarantee for another 5,000 yuan. Before the bail formalities were completed, he was temporarily entrusted to lawyer He Xianzhang. This is the fourth correction. The above four points are entrusted to us to write to your newspaper, requesting that these corrections be made and published accurately. With respect, we address this to the Chief Editor of Shen Bao. Yours sincerely, Chen Wen, Attorney-at-Law, December 17th.</p>
<p>Respectfully, in yesterday's local news of your esteemed paper, there was a report stating "School Turns Into Gambling Den at Night," and "The school building at No. 28, Lane 411, Xinda Gulu is owned by Li Jijing," and your paper recorded news such as "Every night there is gambling going on day and night at the school.” After verification, these reports do not correspond with the facts. Here is a detailed account of the true situation. The building at No. 28, Lane 411, Xinda Gulu is leased to Zhenxi Primary School as a branch school. On the morning of the 14th of this month, Li Jichang came and asked us to allow his indirect friend to use the house for an evening banquet. Because the house had already been rented to Zhenxi Primary School, this request could not be granted. Therefore, Mr. Li negotiated further with the school. The school authorities, considering it a routine matter and due to the friendship between Mr. Li and us, as well as considerations of hospitality, agreed. However, unexpectedly, they engaged in illegal activities. Because the school is a branch school, no one lives there, so the situation was not noticed. Only when the Chengdu Road police discovered the incident that night were we shocked upon hearing the news. Fortunately, the police investigation clarified that the landlord was completely uninvolved. We are sending this letter urgently, hoping that you will grant a correction. Addressed to the Chief Editor of Shen Bao, from Li Heji, December 17th.</p>

<h3>Adultery Case Settled Out of Court, But Lawsuit Not Withdrawn, Court Sentences Accused According to Law. Wang Caiyuan and Hu Ge Shi Each Sentenced to Two Months Imprisonment. Execution to Begin Immediately After Final Judgment</h3>
<p>Hu Jusheng, a Ningbo native aged 44, known for his Ningbo opera performances at No. 6, Shoufu Lane, Caishi Road, French Concession, married a local woman, Ge Shi, whose other name is Xiao Jinhua, aged 27, ten years ago. Ge Shi also performs Ningbo opera and used to perform in various amusement venues. A year ago, Mr. and Mrs. Hu both performed at the Ruyi Restaurant near the Xixin Bridge entrance in Caishi Street, which led to Ge Shi becoming involved with Wang Caiyuan (aged 29), a fellow Ningbo native, young male actor and stage manager. They often met in secret at hotels. Mr. Hu had heard of this for some time, but lacking evidence, he could not act. Recently, they went a step further and rented a room together at No. 14, Lixian Lane, Laihuo Street, unbeknownst to Mr. Hu. After Mr. Hu discovered this, he went to catch them in the act, but being alone, he was overpowered, and Wang and Ge managed to escape and move. On the 18th of this month, Mr. Hu found out that Wang and Ge were still living at No. 14, Lixian Lane, in a room on the top floor. The following morning, he reported this to the French police station, which dispatched officers to arrest Wang and Ge. They were sent to the Special Second Court, where lawyer Yuan Jiahuang of the police department filed a public prosecution for adultery. Judge Zhu Chuzhe interrogated them, and the defendants admitted to the adultery and hired lawyers for their defense. After the court hearing was concluded, a date for sentencing was set. The two defendants were released on bail to await further instructions. After Wang Caiyuan and Hu Ge Shi were released on bail, they sought mediation with the plaintiff, Hu Jusheng, to reach a settlement. Yesterday was the date for sentencing, and the two defendants thought that since they had already reached a settlement out of court, the court would not pass a sentence. Therefore, the defendants did not appear in court. However, unexpectedly, at 10 a.m. yesterday, Judge Zhu of the Special Second Court came to the Third Criminal Court and, upon finding that neither the plaintiff nor the defendants had appeared, immediately announced the verdict: Wang Caiyuan and Hu Ge Shi, for committing adultery with a married person and being a married person committing adultery, are each sentenced to two months of imprisonment. In this case, the plaintiff did not withdraw the lawsuit after the out-of-court settlement. In the future, after the judgment is delivered, if the defendants do not file an appeal within the appeal period, the court will summon the defendants to appear for execution of the sentence after the judgment becomes final.</p>
<h3>Shi Ruwei Lecture: The Theory and Application of Ferromagnetism, at the Chinese Institute of Electrical Engineers</h3>
<p>The Chinese Institute of Electrical Engineers recently invited Dr. Shi Ruwei of the Academia Sinica to give a lecture on "The Theory and Application of Ferromagnetism" at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club. Dr. Shi stated that the discovery of ferromagnetism in China was very early; the Yellow Emperor's invention of the compass was an early application of ferromagnetism. Among the more than ninety chemical elements known today, the most famous ferromagnetic substances are iron, nickel, and cobalt. According to recent research, electrons in atoms, in addition to revolving in orbits, also have their own rotation, called spin. The rotation of electrons in each orbit can be either forward or backward. Ferromagnetism is discovered when the number of electrons rotating forward in an atom is not equal to the number of electrons rotating backward. The atoms of iron, nickel, and cobalt all have this characteristic. Previously, the highest magnetic permeability coefficient was only over 20,000. Recently, by refining ferromagnetic materials with high-temperature gas, the magnetic permeability can be increased to 600,000, and the coercive force is also increased more than twofold. Ferromagnetic materials have extensive applications in telecommunications and transportation. This type of research will have a significant impact on electrical engineering science.</p>
<h3>Radio Program Management to Be Directly Controlled by the Central Government; Shanghai Broadcasting Association Plans to Send Wang Wanbai and Others to Beijing</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Private Wireless Radio Broadcasting Association recently received a notice from the Central Broadcasting Administration of the Central Propaganda Department in Nanjing, stating that from December 15th, all radio programs will be reviewed and guided by the central government. All matters related to the review of radio programs jointly handled by the Shanghai Ministry of Communications Telegraph Bureau, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and the Education Bureau should be terminated immediately, and the methods and forms for managing programs should be issued. Yesterday, the association held an executive committee meeting at its offices on Jiangxi Road. First, Chairman Wang Wanbai reported that there was a gathering of all Shanghai private radio station members the day before, and he took the opportunity to meet with various members and solicit opinions. All members expressed great satisfaction with the direct management by the central government, but some members felt that some of the regulations, such as the one stating that radio programs could be changed every three months and had to be submitted one month before implementation, were difficult for private radio stations to implement. It was proposed that representatives, including Chairman Wang Wanbai and standing committee members Su Zuguo and Chen Zigang, be sent to Beijing to present everything in person. The association asked how this should be handled. After discussion, it was decided to first submit the difficult points in the new regulations of the administration for consideration and modification, and then send representatives to Beijing if necessary.</p>
<h3>Yongguang Paint Factory Engineer Lu Shihao Tragically Dies After Falling From a Building; He Was Dissatisfied With the Factory's Workers Before His Death; Family Members Submit Letters Requesting Justice</h3>
<p>Lu Shihao, a 25-year-old Suzhou native and apprentice engineer at the Yongguang Paint Factory on Pingliang Road, Hudong, suddenly fell from the iron handrail on the third floor of the factory at around 9:00 AM the day before yesterday and was injured. He was quickly spotted by workers in the factory who summoned an ambulance to the scene. He was rushed to the Sacred Heart Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he died shortly after. The hospital reported this to the Yangshupu police station, which ordered an investigation. The body was then transported to the Philander Road morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, a report was filed with the First Special Court, which dispatched Prosecutor Zhang, along with forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, to the morgue to confirm that the deceased had indeed died from injuries sustained in a fall from a building. They questioned Zhang Jialiu and others, who testified that they also worked at the factory. That morning, while they were working on the third floor, they suddenly saw the deceased going from the second floor to the third floor and back three times before he went to the iron handrail and fell. Lu Huiyuan, the deceased's older brother, reported that the deceased had been working at the factory for almost a year. He started as a clerk in the accounting department and was later ordered by a Westerner to become an apprentice engineer. Recently, the factory frequently had paint stolen, which the deceased discovered was being done by the workers. However, the foreman, Yan, had connections with the workers, so they were extremely hostile to the deceased. He requested justice and submitted a letter of resignation written by the deceased in English for review. In order to clarify the truth, Zhang Qun ordered the relevant police station to translate the letter and continue the detailed investigation, and instructed that the matter be reviewed again next Monday. The body was allowed to be claimed by the deceased's older brother, Lu Huiyuan, after he provided a guarantee.</p>

As a result, the price of each month's standard yarn was up one and a half yuan to one yuan and eight jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. After the opening in the afternoon, the near month fell, and the second session rose slightly, but by the time of the third closing, the market situation turned downward due to poor yarn sales.

<h3>Sources of Fine Cotton are Obstructed, Cotton Prices are Unanimously High, Speculative Targets are Concentrated on Raw Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending upward, mainly because of the turmoil in Shaanxi, the Longhai Railway is blocked, and transportation has become a problem. It is feared that the sources of cotton may be obstructed, so speculators are becoming active, and the market has turned upward.</p>
<p>Cotton prices rise by five to six jiao</p>
<p>The opening of the standard raw cotton market in the morning, prices rose across all months, because the unrest in Xi'an has not subsided, the Longhai Railway is blocked, and the transportation of goods has been suspended, obstructing the sources of cotton. The longs are taking advantage of the opportunity to become active, and the rising price trend is very strong, but the trend of American cotton is ordinary, the Indian cotton market is closed. As a result, the prices of each month's standard raw cotton rose three to four jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day.

<h3>American Cotton Is Being Sold Short Continuously; Indian Cotton Is Closed; British Cotton Also Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the American cotton market, each month's price rose by one to six points. At the beginning of the session, industry members, foreign merchants, and new off-market accounts all bought in, and the market was firm. Later, due to cotton farmers selling short, a portion of the market reacted in the opposite direction. Judging from the recent selling, the actual position has become strong. After the overseas market closed, the market turned quiet. After the December contract opened, trading was immediately suspended. Some operators were engaged in bidding, so the market price was firm, 24 points higher than the March contract. Before closing, short selling increased, and the longs closed out, and the market price fell back. It is estimated that spot goods remained unchanged, and futures, except for the December contract, ranged from unchanged to falling by six points. British cotton's Red Ensign fell by six points, and futures fell by six or seven points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (6th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Transactions are Particularly Quiet; Transportation of Goods and Money Along the Longhai Line is Obstructed; There is Little Demand in Guangdong and Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was still gloomy. Although standard yarn, raw cotton, and third-class yarn and raw cotton all rebounded, the transportation of goods along the Longhai Line was obstructed. Other northern routes, such as Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao, and southern routes, such as Guangdong, Hunan, and Yunnan, had very little demand. The situation in Fujian and Zhejiang was also the same. The market was quiet, people were calm, and there was no intention to hoard goods. Furthermore, Japanese trading companies intended to take advantage of the high prices to sell off white goods, fine cloth, fine twill, and grey cloth in various months, which caused morale to drop. The selling price of each piece was slightly cheaper, ranging from 0.025 yuan to 0.05 yuan. Diagonals, beiges, woolens, and printed goods markets are still stable. Because the sales season for plain twill velvets has been short, the market atmosphere is weak, and prices are gradually falling, falling by 0.1 yuan to 0.5 yuan compared to the peak. White flannel and corduroy are also slightly cheaper. After the batch of spring poplin was shipped to Hunan and Sichuan last month, the Renfeng, Liming, Huayang, and Tianyi factories have already put their goods on the market after Jiguang and Zhonghua De. Distant customers are reporting samples, but not many transactions have been made. The goods that have been put on sale by the above factories are all plain color poplin, and the price per yard has increased by about 0.06 yuan compared to this spring. As for striped poplin, most will have to wait until the Meiheng factory releases its goods before setting prices.</p>
<h3>Black and Gray Riding Breeches Completely Searched Out</h3>
<p>The No. 30 black and gray riding breeches have been in extremely short supply recently. The asking price is 0.3 yuan to 0.4 yuan higher per yard than other colors, but they are still hard to find. Zhanghua goods are becoming increasingly scarce. Although the factory is rushing to produce them, it is still not enough to meet the demand. Western goods and Japanese goods were unsalable due to high prices in the past, but now sales are increasing due to the cold weather. Chinese goods and Japanese goods are mostly in short supply, so Western goods prices in the market have also risen a lot. Black and gray colors, Chinese and non-Chinese goods are all completely searched out. Yesterday, Zhanghua's Mutton Brand Riding Breeches wholesale price was 6.25 yuan, black and gray futures were out of stock, and the asking price was 6.6 yuan. Western goods 1005 were 7.6 yuan, black and gray were 8.3 to 8.4 yuan, and they were still hard to find.</p>

<h3>Prominent Sales of Keemun Black Tea in England</h3>
<p>The English black tea market has seen inconsistent sales lately. Teas from Ceylon and Java, as well as black teas from the Hunan and Hubei provinces of China, have experienced slower sales compared to previous months. According to a recent survey by the English tea merchant Godfrey, London has over 22.2 million pounds of low-grade black tea in stock. Due to the current economic downturn, sales are proving difficult this autumn. However, high-grade Keemun black tea from China has enjoyed strong sales due to its unique quality.

<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Showed an Upward Trend; Unified Class A Actually Increased by $1.15</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the government bond market situation at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange shifted from a chaotic state to an upward trend. Public sentiment also continued to diminish due to the brewing political situation. Initial buying and selling on the floor was quite active due to the deteriorating situation, with retail investors selling and short sellers adding to their positions. However, a portion of large investors bought aggressively, so the market price rose and fell inconsistently amid the holding positions of both long and short sides. Towards the close, due to rumors of easing in the Shaanxi Incident, large investors once again pushed up the market, and the market price rose uniformly. The market opened extremely chaotic yesterday morning. There was strong buying interest for bonds like 10/37. Retail investors also bought a lot. The market price rose by 0.2-0.3 yuan from E to A class bonds. However, there were many sellers for bonds like 6/35. C class bonds fell slightly by 0.1 yuan. In the secondary market, the market situation became more firm. There was aggressive short covering for bond 47. There were also purchases of bonds 10/11. The market price uniformly continued to rise by 0.1 to 0.55 yuan. B class bonds fell back by 0.2 yuan this month, while bonds like 5/6 were also put up for sale. The market opened in the afternoon, and there was a surge in swap transactions. Bonds like 47/5/11 turned to buying. Retail investors also did a lot of swapping. Bonds 35/14 were sold a lot. The market price was held by both long and short sides, with a difference of only 0.2-0.3 yuan. At closing, due to better news reports, public sentiment stabilized. Bonds like 10/72/32 aggressively announced purchases. The market price uniformly rose by 0.1 to 0.65 yuan. However, there were still sellers for bonds 4/77. The price of forward D class bonds fell slightly by 0.1 yuan. Overall, the result for the day was a uniform increase of 0.2 to 1 yuan. The price of A class bonds actually increased by $1.15. The total transaction volume was 18,655,000 yuan. A comparison of the price increases, decreases, highs, and lows is listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Grains: Short Covering Rises; Flour Falls Then Turns Back Up; Each Month Rebounds by 0.03-0.04 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market in each month showed an initial flat weighting and then rebounded. The quotation for foreign wheat improved by 0.1-0.2 yuan in Chicago, and nearly improved by 0.2 yuan in Canada, with a far drop of about 0.1-0.3 yuan. When the prices were opened, the market sentiment was generally waiting and seeing, with foreign wheat having ups and downs. Most of the transactions in each month were settlements, and new buying and selling accounted for only a small portion. Due to the current uncertain situation, operators inevitably had strong discussions and could not reach a consensus. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, it was initially calm, but then outside short covering rose. Under these circumstances, the factories naturally had no new chips to sell, so the buying sentiment was slightly stronger, and the market easily rose. Compared to the previous day, each month increased by about 0.03-0.04 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wheat Prices Rose Very Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market saw ups and downs in each month at the opening in the morning. This month's market was stagnant due to sluggish trading, up slightly by 0.01 yuan compared to the previous day. March, however, rose by 0.05-0.06 yuan due to stronger buying sentiment. There was no change in March and April. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, trading was more active, and the market was slightly more lively. Most people ultimately felt that with the situation easing and transportation not being hindered, this market value would not rise again. The spot wheat market remained stable, with Jiangbei wheat opening at 6.9 yuan, Shaoxing wheat at 6.84 yuan, and Dongtai wheat at 6.87 yuan, with Fuxin handling 3,000 packages and Danfeng handling 1,000 packages.</p>
<h3>Oil and Salt are Both Expensive; Rice and Flour Rise Together — General Living is Difficult —</h3>
<p>Oil and salt are indispensable in people's food. Since the salt tax was increased and the city scale was adopted, it has increased a lot invisibly. Now, 1 yuan of salt in Shanghai, including the rush bag, is less than 7 catties on the old scale (each catty on the city scale is about 350-360 cash), so it is said that it is not cost-effective to pickle pickles this year. Each load of green vegetables, hawkers often ask for 2.7-2.8 yuan, even if the price is successfully negotiated, it cannot be less than 1.7-1.8 yuan or 2 yuan. Each load of vegetables uses 6-7 catties of salt, so the cost is already no less than 3 yuan. Eating salt and boiling raw vegetables is the most frugal food, and it is already like this, the life of the general poor class is imaginable.</p>
<p>Oil is also necessary for cooking. In the past, small households bought 100-200 cash of oil, which could meet the needs of a day's cooking. But this year the price of soybean oil has now reached 25.5 yuan, more than double the price of last year. Raw oil is also 23.3 yuan, although it costs double the amount, it is difficult to get the amount of last year.</p>
<p>Especially the price of flour, which is as high as 4.3 yuan or more, the general pasta, oil is expensive, flour is expensive, even a snack in the early morning, I am afraid it will cost a few more copper coins.</p>
<p>Rice prices have also risen in recent days. The special japonica rice in Zhabei has reached 11.65 yuan, and the rice in other areas is also above 10 yuan. Compared with the city peck and the old Shanghai peck, it is smaller by 15%, so if calculated with the old peck, it is more than this number. At this time of new production, the price is already like this, I don't know what it will be like in the future.</p>
<p>The forward wheat price also opened at 7.37 yuan yesterday, the spot price of Peidong soybeans opened at 6.3 yuan, and the closing price of April soybeans reached 6.79 yuan.</p>
<p>River Rice All Rise (North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were few boats arriving from various roads under the river, about 26-27. Because the weather was overcast and humid, the market's goods went smoothly, and the market price of white japonica rice was tightened by several cents. The price of medium grade rice increased by about 0.1 yuan. The purchase of Bo Dao Dalian and Tianjin Yantai was quite strong. The sales in this street were also smooth, and the price was expensive. Early rice also rose by 0.2 yuan, and the sales of Biang Yuan were also brisk, and the price increased by another 0.2 yuan. The price of Yang Du Bu Ke Jian increased by a few cents to 0.1 yuan. The prices of other goods also increased nearly a foot.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of 80 ships arrived from various sources, totaling 16,300-16,400 stones. Among them, there were more than 6 ships of Bo Dao. The weather was rainy and people's hearts were quite firm. Sales in this street were still good. Pingjin Qingyan and other gangs also continued to purchase more than 8,000 packages of Bo Dao, while only 400-500 packages of thick japonica rice were purchased, so the market continued to show a thick and thin japonica rice market, and the prices of all increased by 0.05 yuan. However, in the evening market trend, the bag appetite of Bo Dao was not as urgent as the previous day, and today the market may be able to stabilize. Du Yang Jian had no honor or disgrace. The market for Yin Yuan was weak and fragrant, and it continued to rise.</p>
<h3>Rice Transported to Shaanxi Returned Midway</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of Ke Xian rice continued to be strong, but the sales were still sluggish and dull. However, the purchase appetite of this street was still good, and Quanzhou also slightly packed up, but the cargo owners were not in a hurry to sell, and the market was still able to stabilize. However, it was heard that the rice and grain purchased by the Shaanxi army in the Yangtze River had been stopped, and there were also reports that the local merchants' rice transported to Xi'an had returned midway, so people's hearts were inevitably weak. The whole day opened 2,000 packages of Jiangxi rice, 1,500 packages of Hunan rice, and 300 packages of Shanghai-Ningbo rice, and the market was similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3>Continuous Telegrams Repeatedly Reported Declines; Standard Soybeans Plunged; Sesame Seeds Saw New High Prices Again; Yesterday's Futures Oil Cakes Also Slightly Rebounded</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the standard soybean cake market showed a standing market after the opening in the morning, continuing the previous day's rise. There were inquiries and short covering transactions for standard soybeans, and the market price continued to flourish, continuing to rise by several cents to about 0.1 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. Following the news of a sharp turn in Dalian, many began to dump and hedge first, and after continuous telegrams repeatedly reported declines, the market faced a sharp turn down, and the declines were numerous. The decline in standard soybeans was even greater. In the afternoon, the low price differed from the highest price by as much as 0.2-0.3 yuan, especially in April, which differed by 0.33 yuan. The closing price stabilized slightly, but compared to the closing price of the previous day, standard soybeans fell by 0.17 yuan and about 0.15 yuan, while standard cakes fell by 0.05-0.07 yuan, and standard oil fell by 0.3-0.65 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot yellow soybean market situation: the morning market was tight again due to the continuous rise in Dalian, and the market price increased by about 0.1 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the news that the Dalian market had rebounded slightly, the market atmosphere immediately turned flat, and the standard decline. The spot market belonged to the holding position. The market made 3 cars of Siping Street soybeans, 3,000 packages of Hankou Zhazadou, and 1,000+ packages of Jiujiang Chidou, and 400-500 packages of various Du beans. The previous day, Yangzhuang sesame seeds had opened at 15.2 yuan, and Hehe Yangxing bought 100 tons. Later, it was shouted to 15.4 yuan, and it was heard that the buying appetite was not greedy, so the transaction was not concluded. At the moment, the market is temporarily stable, and various special new high prices may be conserved for a while.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: The First Batch of New Dia Qing Will Arrive Soon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat. The association's price for No. 24 coarse sand white spot was 21.6 yuan, the re-export cargo was 6.2 yuan, and the spot price for Dongbai Simatsu (J) mark was 21.6 yuan, and there was a transaction. There were no other changes. The prices of Mian Bai, Da Sa Jin Xin, and other No. 1 grades of this factory remained unchanged. In the number board, the Chao Gang opened dozens of packages of spot Xin Chao Qing, with a price of 14.1-2 yuan, but the market will inevitably continue to loosen, so the goods that can be released next Tuesday are only opened at 13.7 yuan, which is smaller than 0.4 yuan, and hundreds of packages were traded. Yesterday, more than 100 packages of Xin Zhu Qing, which arrived by the Guangdong ship, were inferior in quality, and the price was 13 yuan, which was smaller than nearly 1 yuan. It is heard that the first batch of Xin Dia Qing is already on the way and will arrive in Shanghai soon, but unfortunately, the transportation is too late, and it is the time of decline, and it is difficult to expect a good price.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Newly Arrived Longan Awaits Opening; Due to the Situation... The Firm's Interest Remains Weak</h3>
<p>The previous batch of Quanzhou longan, etc., at that time, because the customers hoped that the rise would be too extravagant, they held each other until they did not become a market. Recently, there has been a gradual possibility of approaching between the number lines, but due to the Xi'an Incident, the firm's intention to enter has weakened again, and it has been hindered and shelved. Generally, it is necessary to wait for the situation to be settled before proceeding with price negotiations. According to reports from various production areas, the longan feet are very firm, and there is no hope of excessive loosening in the later market. However, at this moment, those entering the household intend to suppress manpower slightly, which is also common sense.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: The Silk Market Has Been Silent for a Long Time and is Thinking of Moving</h3>
<p>Foreign Firms' Silk Trading is Lively; Users are Also Excited About Silk</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market showed considerable recovery at home and abroad. New York's 83-degree raw silk rose by 0.04, 75-degree rose by 0.03, Guangdong silk rose by 0.03, Shanghai silk rose by 0.04, exchange actual sales, near and far period rose by 0.02-0.025, Yokohama spot rose by 10 yuan, futures rose by 13 yuan, Lyon still maintained the original price. From this, it can be seen that the overseas silk market has gradually turned good, so the Shanghai silk trade has also become lively again. The market has risen accordingly, such as SL brand 13.15, which was sold at 780 yuan yesterday, which is about 10 yuan higher than the market price on the 15th. US-made white factory 78 uniformly, sold at 740 yuan, RR sold at 760 yuan, which is much higher than the previous week. It seems that India has been satisfied recently, and the silk trade for users has gradually felt excited. The Shanghai silk market may be thinking of moving after being silent for a long time.</p>
<h3>A Person's Fantasies in the Nursery</h3>
<p>— Yang Xia</p>
<p>As I entered, I quietly exclaimed inwardly, "Great!" The grove, the cyan sky above the grove, and the clear autumn light in the whole garden washed my heart clean. I rejoiced in this unexpected discovery. Walking inside, the verdant flat leaves of the cypress and the Chinese parasol formed a quiet path, flanked by emerald-green cannas, scarlet maples, dark ancient palm trees, trellises of honeysuckle, leafless ginkgos, and all sorts of strange and unnameable plants. Little white butterflies fluttered before me, and among the green foliage were scattered crimson and light-purple autumn flowers, dancing in the bright sunlight, full of joyous life. It was early November, the season of "orange and yellow, tangerine and green" praised by the ancient poets, and the orange and cassia trees in this garden were beginning to emit their enchanting fragrance. Besides the fragrance that lingered in the nostrils, there was also a subtle and indescribable country and pastoral atmosphere. Amidst the chirping of large birds and the melancholy chirping of autumn cicadas, I walked lonely into the small path behind the deserted pond. The pond surface was covered with a layer of duckweed, and several young women were painting. I did not disturb them, because the scenery before me captivated me. At this time, the leaves were slightly falling, and I sat in a corner, admiring the dappled autumn scene like an ancient brocade, lost in wonder at a strangely shaped tree. Then a rustling rain of gold descended, falling on my hair, my lapels, and the ground, and then quietly lying there. This reminded me of the Zen-like poetic realm of "The mountain path is deserted and uninhabited, and the flowers fall and open of themselves," and I sank into an absent-minded state. Suddenly, I heard a whooshing sound by my neck. I turned my head sharply, and far away! Hey! A dragonfly!</p>
<p>How tranquil, how blessed! I, who had been flattened by work for several years, was being granted an excessive gift, like singing in a "beggar picks up gold" opera. This nursery was in the near suburbs of western Shanghai, with few people, escaping from etiquette and breaking the shackles. I lay in a chair and stared blankly at the sky. The mid-autumn sky was like fine porcelain from Jingdezhen, a pure color without a trace of impurities, making people feel a primeval reverence. In the distance, the school bell rang, pacing from the vast wilderness to my side. An eagle circled majestically but helplessly above my head. I wanted to fly, to leave this world adorned with slaughter, folly, and lies.</p>
<p>Watching the smoke from the kitchen chimneys curling up in the sky, my thoughts also drifted away with it.</p>
<p>I am now on the ground, and this ground has stinging thorns, but it also has the medicinal oil that stops bleeding. However, under the advertising of "unexpected efficacy," we frown in suspicion at many medicines. A great man said that there is no era more complex than the one we live in. We bear this ethical and aesthetic burden, and only brave people can bear it. In the heart of the troubled modern world, I have also heard a call, using Rousseau's "return to nature" to instruct us. What is said is not wrong. For me, who was born with some idealistic tendencies, nature is only a nurturing mother to an infant, a hostel for a weary traveler. But beauty is often the kinsman of ugliness. Similarly on the ground, watching everything flourish, the most boastful of mankind walks in droves to the darkest, most shameless, and most unreasonable corners. Isn't this contradictory contrast a wonderful absurdity! I have seen too much of the "world," and the faces of Qingmian Liaoya that I have seen make me say extremely hateful things about mankind. When I have nothing to do, I escape to the wilderness to find my joy. When I see the blue sky, I often think of the duke in Tolstoy's War and Peace, who was accustomed to feasting, wounded on the battlefield, lying on the grass and looking at the blue autumn sky: "How pure! How perfect! It's as if I've never noticed it before..." What clear wisdom! Unfortunately, this wisdom secretly slipped away when he returned to the decadent social scene in Petersburg.</p>
<p>Speaking of war and peace, a thought stung me like a bee. Our entire nation—I should say all of humanity—is now at a crossroads between war and poverty, using blood capital to make a desperate gamble, betting on a future fortune. The flowers and birds singing before us are clearly a sugar coating on a bitter pill, or even a mirage that will disappear in an instant. Escape is also impossible, because the appreciation of nature, the roaming of poetic inspiration, the laughter and tears of love, all these beautiful flowers are clearly rooted in the soil of society. Within a dangerous country, singing about "cassia trees in the third autumn, lotus fragrance for ten miles" will arouse the thoughts of foreign races riding horses in the Central Plains. People without the cultivation of a famous scholar in a cultured city will find it difficult to have a sense of "Mount Tai collapsing in front of them without changing color" when faced with the stimuli that come. I am sitting in a chair, and in my hand is today's newspaper, which tells me this intricate kaleidoscope-like "one day of the world." Outside this quiet little garden of flowers and trees, there are countless our brothers are struggling, sweating, and doing the work of saints, but I, with the detachment of a recluse and the indifference of a cynic, linger in a corner of the nursery, allowing history to slip past me, futilely wanting to build a "dream of a perfect Hua Xu," which is also ridiculous and pathetic. I am still young, I want to live, I want to be full of vigorous vitality, I cannot be like the youth in that Russian novel who said, "Go! Useless life!" before he took his last breath!</p>
<p>The world is a changeable and brilliant Garden of Eden. There is only one bridge through the dirty ditch. This bridge is not escape, not seclusion, but holding up the torch of ideals and confidence, stepping forward, forward...</p>
<h3>Dream</h3>
<p>— Fabricated</p>
<p>Who is it? Knocking on my heart,</p>
<p>You say, why are you silent?</p>
<p>Big-eyed person,</p>
<p>Tell me, what is your name?</p>
<p>What is the use of smiling,</p>

<h3>Ah Pao (Note 1)</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Shan</p>
<p>Grave robber Ding Xiang cowered in the darkness, his heart pounding, eager to rush out from under the corner of the house where he was hiding, so that his legs could not stand straight – he had to bend like a gorilla in the wild, and tremble as if he had encountered something stressful. This was a winter night in Guangzhou that no one would remember, very cold, white frost falling on the tiles along the street, rustling. The street ran straight to the east and west, people were all asleep, the gates tightly closed, only small shops sixty feet away on either side, the lamplight weakly shining from half-closed doors onto the ground, or the drainage outlets of the moats—a small, fishpond-like calm surface of water.</p>
<p>"SY——" he sighed. There was no sound around him. Had he been standing on the road for two hours?—it didn't seem to have attracted the attention of the houses feigning idiocy and the roving darkness. He vigorously rubbed his cold, stiff hands a few times and cursed softly, "Damn his old shit!" (Note 2)</p>
<p>Footsteps came from afar... the figure flashed in the lamplight of the shop and disappeared into the dark night—a vast, impenetrable piece of silent black iron. Grave robber Ding Xiang stamped out his cigarette, took off his ragged woolen cap, and put it back on firmly, three toothpicks stuck where the hatband was knotted, like light needles from the sun.</p>
<p>"Stop!" Ding Xiang shouted sternly. The person was just walking past... the night was pierced, emitting a cracking sound.</p>
<p>"Moving will cause you to suffer more from illness than death itself, don't move!"</p>
<p>It was a plump, fair-skinned merchant of about thirty-five, calm-headed, lacking courage but unusually sensitive. He had fraudulently swindled the boss and employees of his friend's carpentry shop out of seven dollars in cash and was preparing to go home for a delicious midnight snack.</p>
<p>From the first shout, he knew that he had unfortunately encountered Ah Pao, who must be a strong character wearing a plain black tattered short coat, strong enough to kill him. There was no other way. There were no police, and it was still far from home. Perhaps that bastard even had a pistol—a small knife... that was certain... so he cleverly pretended not to hear and kept walking forward.</p>
<p>"If he runs into a deaf man, you can't harm him!" the merchant thought to himself, walking straight ahead without even looking to the side.</p>
<p>"Maybe he's a chivalrous fool. I'll tell him about my ears, that they're sick now... maybe he's intimidating me, testing my courage—but if that's not the case, I'll just tell a lie and say I only have one dollar, and let him take it or not, take out one dollar and give it to him..." Thinking this far, the merchant couldn't think any further.</p>
<p>Ding Xiang walked alongside him, pulled out the small knife from his garter, waving it at the man. He watched, amused, as if watching a white maggot crawling out of its dung pit.</p>
<p>"Where are you planning to go?"</p>
<p>"What are you planning to do?"</p>
<p>"Take out all your money!"</p>
<p>"I have no money—"</p>
<p>"Then take off your cotton robe..."</p>
<p>"It's so cold—you're too inhuman."</p>
<p>Discharged veteran Huang Quan rushed out from the darkness. He was strongly built, like a wall being toppled, blocking the way.</p>
<p>"Get out of the way!" he said to Ding Xiang, mistaking the latter for a poor devil trying to borrow some money from a relative. "Give me the money you have! Be sensible!"</p>
<p>Huang Quan didn't recognize Ding Xiang, ran out first—only then opening his mouth to haggle, and saying "Be sensible" ... all of which proved that Huang Quan was a new gangster who didn't know the rules. He was so poor that he had even sold his knife, stretching out two large palms, flapping them like a goose on both sides.</p>
<p>The two of them fiercely grappled and beat each other. Ding Xiang had preemptively stuffed the small knife into his sock, then charged at the tall discharged veteran like a wild leopard. The merchant stood by dumbfounded, slowly walking away. He dared not run quickly for fear of being discovered—if these two family wipers (Note 3) woke up and agreed to divide all his possessions equally—he thought, then he would surely die this time.</p>
<p>Ding Xiang knocked down the discharged veteran, chasing after him with an enraged roar, and they collided face to face again. Ding Xiang was warm all over, his blood vessels flowing like thousands of fire snakes drilling through a forest. Leaping and flowing, he now had no room for patience or amusement, and was about to freely dispose of his prey.</p>
<p>"I'm truly grateful to you. I can't express my gratitude enough."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"You are a hero—" the merchant bowed slightly.</p>
<p>"Humph—" Ah Pao hesitated.</p>
<p>"You saved me from that evil spirit, you—"</p>
<p>"Nonsense, I didn't beat him up for you! If you don't shut up, I'll kill you, listen!"</p>
<p>The merchant was silent for a moment, and suggested that they divide all the money he had equally, and that they should be friends often in the future, and that he could even invite him to work as a shop assistant in his shop.</p>
<p>"Delusion!" Ah Pao Ding Xiang sneered like striking iron, "Give me everything you have, and I'll still think it's not enough!"</p>
<p>The calm-headed unfortunate cursed in his heart, "Damn it! I can only give you half at most, whatever." But in reality, he took out all his possessions plus the money he won, a total of nine dollars.</p>
<p>Ding Xiang took the banknotes—as if he were holding burning red coals, immediately throwing them on the ground, the banknotes sinking in the darkness. He felt strongly ashamed. That cunning merchant must not have completely submitted to him, if he hadn't beaten that veteran so heavily just now. To make him submit—did he have no better power? He had to knock down that hungry man—did he definitely have to do that? He became enraged.</p>
<p>He started to beat the unfortunate victim, he wanted to use all his strength to make that person resist him, and then subdue him directly himself. He pressed the merchant to the ground—it was at the entrance of a large house, paved with smooth cement, the heavy thick wooden door tightly closed, as if the house had not been inhabited for a century, he raised his fist and pounded the guy's chest and head, pulled out the small knife to threaten him:</p>
<p>"Son of a bitch, hit me!"</p>
<p>Ding Xiang stood up smoking a cigarette, the fire of the cigarette butt burning red the entire night, under the dim light, the unfortunate figure crawled on the ground using his painful hand to pick up the scattered banknotes.</p>

<h3>"Jiangbei People"</h3>
<p>— Qing Shuang</p>
<p>My hometown is adjacent to the riverbank, so it has a close relationship with the people on the north bank of the Yangtze River. Although there is a stretch of water in between, travel depends only on a kind of "righteous ferry boat", which has to brave the dangers of wind and waves. In fact, it inevitably creates a layer of separation, but travel is still relatively convenient. Therefore, the so-called "Jiangbei people" who live in and around my hometown, inside and outside the city, from the north bank, are particularly numerous.</p>
<p>These "Jiangbei people" who came across by ferry from the north bank are not from the few counties along the river on the north bank, but from a few counties a little further north, such as Yancheng, Xinghua, and Funing. Moreover, they are all bankrupt farmers who are so poor in their hometowns that it is difficult to gain a foothold. Therefore, the three words "Jiangbei people" added to their heads have a special meaning contained within them in the eyes of people who consider themselves to be "Jiangnan people."</p>
<p>Near my house, there lived many such "Jiangbei people."</p>
<p>Their occupations are roughly as follows: Men: pull rickshaws (just like almost ninety percent of the rickshaw pullers in Shanghai were contracted by Jiangbei people, the same is true in my hometown, with fewer locals pulling rickshaws, only pulling rickshaws for wealthy people), do hard labor, and attend to all kinds of low-level tasks for weddings, funerals, and celebrations. Occasionally, some work in factories, but not many. Women: work as domestic helpers, or work in factories, washing clothes for others, etc.</p>
<p>Their residences can be built extremely simply and quickly. They are, of course, all thatched huts, with walls made of reed mats. A dozen or so large bamboos, a dozen or so reed mats, and one or two loads of rice straw can be used to build a house in a single day (in reality, it can only be said to be a shed). Those that use mud to build the walls are considered more elaborate. Thatched huts are prone to fire, so fires often occur. Outside the north gate of my county, there is a large open space, which everyone calls the Lufangchang, because the Jiangbei people who live in that open space mostly weave reed mats for a living, hence the name. There are no less than one or two hundred households of Jiangbei people living there, thatched huts one after another, facing each other. If a fire doesn't break out, then that's it; if one house catches fire, the whole area will be burned. Then they come and carry out a restoration work again, and in a few months, everything is back to normal. In the past one or two decades, I don't know how many times it has been burned back and forth.</p>
<p>One summer, I returned to my hometown and stayed for a few months. It was then that I saw a little of the lives of the Jiangbei people, whom I had never cared about.</p>
<p>The Jiangbei family who lived near my house, husband and wife, were only in their early thirties, but they already had five children. The man's occupation was: helping others with odd jobs, with no fixed tasks. Today, he goes to help out for a day at a family's celebration; tomorrow, he goes to help out for one or two days at a family's funeral. When there's nothing to do, he wanders around. The woman, already having so many children, can no longer work in a factory, and can only spare some time to wash clothes for nearby families, or to deliver gifts that people give each other. Within half a year of having her last child, she had another new job: working as a wet nurse for others. But there were also some wealthy local families where it was not children but adults who drank human milk, because it was said that human milk was more nutritious than cow's milk, and they actually hired her to squeeze a cup of milk every morning as a tonic. The price was probably between five and ten cents per cup, but I can't remember clearly. As the children grew older, they ate the same food as the adults, and they needed to wear more clothes, and the heavy burden gradually weighed down on them. There was no way, so they had to ask their twelve- or thirteen-year-old eldest child to find work. Work was reluctantly found (there is a yarn factory near my hometown, which is the only modern industry in the county), but after one or two months, the eldest child fell ill. The parents said that he was lazy and couldn't do the work, and in addition to scolding him harshly, they also had to whip him. After seeing their situation of being unable to maintain this life, we stood by and felt embarrassed to speak out! We shouldn't beat the child. Instead, we ran over and scolded the child too.</p>
<p>When the husband had something to do, he seemed quite happy, buying three sheng of rice and cutting a catty of beef, and happily burning it to eat when he got home. Seeing the husband and wife sitting face to face, the children scrambling to eat meat, making a scene, people on the side praised them for having family happiness. Hearing this, the two of them also grinned and smiled. But this situation could not last for more than three to five days. The husband got drunk again, and not only that, but he also went to the gambling den and lost the only half-dollar he had left.</p>
<p>"Damn it! He took the half-dollar I earned yesterday washing clothes for Grandma Wang and lost it again, and we won't have dinner tonight..."</p>
<p>The sound of crying came from the thatched shed again,鑽到街上. Neighbors unanimously spoke up for her, saying:</p>
<p>"Little Sanzi is really going to die! Confused fool! Has no conscience!"</p>
<p>Fighting,吵駡, and crying, when these sounds were transmitted from the thatched shed to the ears of the neighbors, everyone knew: the Xiaosanzis' family days were hard again for the two days.</p>
<p>The child crawled on the ground all day long. His body was covered in mud, from head to toe, and not a single piece of skin was clean. He had a snot dangling half an inch out of his nose all day long. So someone would sigh and say:</p>
<p>"The Jiangbei people are ultimately of lowly character! Look at them like that, they don't look like a family's children at all!"</p>
<p>When the hot weather arrived, bedbugs and mosquitoes concentrated all their efforts to attack them. Mosquito nets were of course not easy to see among them, the only defensive weapon was a kind of mosquito incense stick made of wood shavings, but bedbugs could never be resisted.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, she would say to us with red and swollen eyes: "I didn't sleep all night last night!"</p>
<p>On the children's bodies, we found mosquito bites and bedbug bites all over the body from head to toe, and blood stains from scratches were like spider webs.</p>
<p>Grandma Wang said to her:</p>
<p>"Changsheng (the eldest child's name)'s mother, why don't you wash the child more often, they're covered in dirt!"</p>
<p>We would not easily go to their shed. There, smoke, heat, moldy smells, all kinds of smells were mixed into a unique stench, this smell made you unable to stand inside for a minute. However, this was their only "home".</p>
<p>Of course, neighbors, such as Grandma Wang, often gave them some broken clothes, broken shoes, and leftovers in the name of charity, but sometimes they were still rotten. But when she received these gifts, naturally, she said words of thanks, which made Grandma Wang smile.</p>
<p>As far as I know, the lives of the Jiangbei people who live in and around my hometown are probably not much better than this family's.</p>
<p>However, they are ultimately "outsiders", let alone "Jiangbei people"? The locals and them, although both have yellow faces and speak the same language, are not only the same country, but also the same province, only separated by the Yangtze River, dividing the same piece of land into "Jiangnan" and "Jiangbei". In addition, they are all bankrupt farmers who are so poor in their hometowns that it is difficult to gain a foothold, and are driven to foreign lands by the coercion of life. Otherwise, there is no special difference between them and us who call ourselves "Jiangnan people" in any aspect. However, the three words "Jiangbei people" have a special connotation in our "Jiangnan people"'s eyes. On closer analysis, it is probably the components of poverty, dirt, and ignorance that are then crystallized into the term "Jiangbei people". In the consciousness of the general public, almost such a pattern has been formed: Jiangbei people—are the lowest class of people, they can do what others don't do.</p>
<p>The January 28th Incident broke out. In Zhabei, Shanghai, a large number of Jiangbei people were found to have been used by the enemy as "traitors." They had no food to eat. They failed to organize them into a powerful anti-enemy army in advance, and abandoned them to the enemy, and the punishment they received was: "Traitors!" Who said they shouldn't be killed?</p>
<p>From the discovery of this fact, the Chinese people naturally followed the logic to obtain the following conclusion: All "Jiangbei people" are "traitors"!</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau issued an order:</p>
<p>"All Jiangbei people residing in this county must move out of the country within one week."</p>
<p>When that Jiangbei family was driven out of the country, she said to us, crying:</p>
<p>"It's also death if we go back!"</p>
<h3>Climbing the City of Chang'an</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>Chang'an—this ancient city, when I read history in the past, I often thought: How interesting it would be to visit that ancient city someday. This major city in the Yellow River basin, the hub of culture in past dynasties, although it has been neglected in recent centuries (since January 28th, this city seems to have been attracting more and more attention every day), just admiring its remains is enough to appreciate it. Later, although I learned that the current city of Chang'an is no longer the Chang'an of the Han Dynasty, that didn't matter. Wouldn't the city of Chang'an left over from the Sui and Tang dynasties be enough to see and broaden my horizons?</p>
<p>This was a fantasy in the past, but I never imagined that this fantasy would actually become a reality, and I actually ran all the way from the dull city of Beiping to the city of Chang'an. Since this trip was unexpected and very rare, I could hardly believe that it was true, because according to my plan, visiting Chang'an should have been something that would only be realized in four or five years.</p>
<p>But, I actually climbed the city of Chang'an to admire the scenery outside the city.</p>
<p>To get on the city, my companion Shi and I went to great lengths. We thought we could get up near the city gate, so we ran all the way to the south gate, but we ran into a snag. Right next to the gate was written "No Climbing the City" in neat characters, and looking at the old city tower and the city wall, we couldn't help but feel endless sorrow, and our enthusiasm cooled down by more than half.</p>
<p>"What should we do? It's so wrong to have run all this way for nothing," Shi said unhappily.</p>
<p>"Let's go and look for another place. There should still be a place to get up on the city, didn't we see people strolling on the city a few days ago?" I continued, "Let's go and take a look to the west."</p>
<p>In fact, our decision to go and take a look to the west was originally told to us by a familiar friend, who said that there was a place to get on the city on the west side, but the alleys were narrow and very dirty, and if we could get on the city elsewhere, it would be better not to take this route. But now we had no choice but to seek out this dirty path. We left the south gate, "went straight west, passed several horizontal alley entrances, and finally found that dirty little road. Sure enough, we could get up to the city from there. We were extremely happy to have discovered this dirty place, but when we saw the few buttocks displayed on that small road, and the piles of feces everywhere, and smelled the foul odor that filled the air, we couldn't help but feel that it was a bit of a letdown. We walked through this area of feces at a rapid pace, and ran straight up to the city wall.</p>
<p>Climbing the city wall was a first for me in my life. Although my hometown had a city, because the city wall was only two feet wide, I naturally couldn't get up. Thanks to Beiping, I had only climbed a section of the Forbidden City next to the "History Museum," which didn't count, so this time it was the first official climb. When I was a child, I heard people say that two or three large carts could walk side by side on the city of Beijing, and I didn't believe it at the time. Later, when I arrived in Beiping, once I climbed the Forbidden City, I believed that this statement was not a lie. This time, when I climbed the city of Chang'an, I saw that two or three large carts could also walk on it, so I didn't find it very surprising.</p>
<p>The city of Chang'an has a circumference of forty li, which is not considered a large city, but the city wall is neat and spectacular, which is probably due to the two renovations during the Ming and Qing dynasties. At present, it is fresher and neater than the city of Beiping. It immediately reminded me of the tragic siege of the city seventeen years ago. At that time, I heard that countless people in the city starved to death, but when I carefully observed the city wall, I couldn't see any traces of destruction by gunfire. Perhaps it was on the gun emplacement where I was standing that machine guns were set up in the past, shooting to death countless fellow countrymen who were attacking the city. Now the city of Chang'an is still unharmed, but those who died in the disaster used their lives to create a high and meritorious leadership position for others. They must have died with some comfort, right? Speaking of Chinese ancient cities, almost all of them have gone through some tragic sieges and battles, right?</p>
<p>Shi and I looked out, but we saw the Zhongnan Mountains holding out a cloud of gray, hidden under the mist-like clouds in the south. Looking at it coldly, it looked like clusters of floating clouds. The plateau undulated like layers of waves, interspersed with green forests, thatched huts, sand, and brilliant sunlight, like a landscape painting. The scenic road rushed out from the south gate and drilled straight into the mountain recesses that could not be seen in the field of vision, gray, like a long snake, and occasionally there were one or two cars coming and going, looking like crawling ants. I heard that this scenic road was renovated by some committee and actually cost tens of thousands of yuan. A little closer, the Big Wild Goose Pagoda stood shaking, stretching straight into the sky from the fields, like two gateposts, the old color showing that it had gone through a long time. From time to time, flocks of crows flew around in front of and behind the tower. At night, the two towers are probably their good places to roost. Closer still, a small railway crawled crookedly, which was naturally used to transport goods. The two rails were thin, just like two earthworms, crawling all the way to the west of the city. The coal smoke rising from the brick kiln was like a wisp of light gauze, spreading out and then withdrawing. Closer still, on the dry south bank of the moat, some holes were placed in scattered places. These were the underground caves where people lived, with door frames and faded spring couplets. Children sat outside the caves playing various games. After all, the outside of the city was a bit desolate. Looking out, there were not many houses on the wilderness. Just the isolation of a city wall made the situation completely different.</p>
<p>We looked back at the city, and the houses were so closely packed together that they were like combs. The noise was also incomparable to the quiet and quiet outside the city. The city of Chang'an lacked tall buildings. Besides the bell tower and the drum tower, there were only a few city gate towers. All the houses looked generally the same height. The mud walls and tiled roofs looked as if they were carved out of a model, with absolutely no difference. However, recently, several merchants have built buildings.</p>
<p>The wind on the city wall was slightly stronger, and when a person who was used to living in the city lived in narrow streets and alleys all day long, it was the most pleasant and rare thing to climb the city and widen his horizons and look around. We were strolling on the city, and it turned out that the city was not lacking in dung heaps everywhere. It was a pleasant thing for a person to be able to defecate and urinate on the city every day, and when we walked to another gun emplacement, we saw two men in robes pulling down their buttocks and squatting down. Probably, the municipal authorities have not yet managed the sanitation of this place?</p>
<p>Browsing the scenery on the city can indeed make one feel comfortable. I felt the good of this when I climbed the city of Chang'an, but I didn't know how to recall its past for this ancient cultural capital.</p>
<h3>Dusk</h3>
<p>— Fable</p>
<p>Lightly rub my eyes,</p>
<p>Determined to dispel sleepiness,</p>
<p>Looking out the window,</p>
<p>Dusk in the rain.</p>
<p>It's getting dark,</p>
<p>My stomach rumbles.</p>
<p>The clapper sound of the wonton seller,</p>
<p>So tempting.</p>
<p>What was the scene in the past?</p>
<p>Like a floating cloud.</p>
<p>The pain before my eyes,</p>
<p>Supposedly, this is life!</p>
<p>From dawn to night!</p>
<p>I grit my teeth and pass it:</p>
<p>Can I say that being flustered is my fate?</p>
<p>Can I say that poverty is my own incompetence?</p>
<p>Swallowed a mouthful of saliva, tightened my belt,</p>
<p>The clapper sound of the wonton seller has gone far away.</p>

<h3>No Way to "Follow"</h3>
<p>— Fang Kewen</p>
<p>——"Before the 'slave' as a type of human existed, women were already slaves." (Bebel)</p>
<p>Mr. Hitler, under the fluttering of the swastika flag, once loudly shouted the slogan "Women, return to the home!" There were many reasons, including the fact that raising children is a woman's "sacred duty." It was also said that because women entered society, they were taking away men's jobs, so they had to be forced back home. In the East, this theory, to quote the words of the national essence scholars, "has existed since ancient times," and a "three obediences" method was even more simply established: at home, obey your father; after marriage, obey your husband; after your husband dies, obey your son. This method seems to be the most thorough, and seems more straightforward than the set of taking away men's jobs; they are determined not to strain their throats singing Hua Dan roles, and straightforwardly say that women, from birth to death, should "obey men."</p>
<p>The idea is thoughtful, and for thousands of years, women have been "following." But the problem remains, what if there is no way to "follow"? For example:</p>
<p>Yan Yueying, a woman from Suzhou, once entered the world of prostitution in her youth. Because she was appreciated by the wealthy merchant Liu ××, she was quickly hired as a concubine. However, because the first wife was fierce, Liu and Yan moved to a villa in Qingdao, and had a son. Several years ago, Liu passed away, and Yan was forced to leave the house by the first wife. The son was taken back to be raised by Liu's first wife. Now, the son has grown up and has also received a share of Liu's inheritance. However, since his biological mother, Yan, did not remarry after leaving the house, she faced difficult living conditions. She once asked her biological son to confirm their mother-son relationship, but the son, limited by the conditions of inheriting Liu's property, refused outright. As a result, the mother and son have been involved in lawsuits in court twice. A few days ago, Yan personally went to her son's house, asking him to consider their mother-son relationship and provide support, but the son not only refused to acknowledge her, but also drove Yan out of the house, hurling insults at her. After Yan returned home, she felt unbearable pain and resentment, and secretly swallowed poison in an attempt to end her life.</p>
<p>Such cases of no way to "follow" certainly did not start with Yan, but this is a good example. From this example, we can clearly know: even if one is willing to quietly be a "slave," it is not easy to do, and there are different levels among them.</p>
<p>As for those who can "follow," logically they should "follow" on, but it is also very dangerous. Even if one is willing to wholeheartedly "follow," the husband's infidelity is also very common. At that time, there may also be no way to "follow." Therefore, some more progressive people advocate gender equality, demanding that women be liberated from the kitchen, demanding that women have equal opportunities for education with men, and even demanding that women participate in politics and that all public undertakings have women participating.</p>
<p>This progress is naturally gratifying, but it only goes so far. The result is that a few wives of important people are participating in politics, a few wives of celebrities are also presiding over some women's associations or something, and a few daughters of capitalists have also entered some universities or gone abroad for gilding. As for the majority of women? Still the same. Still living in the mire, still wallowing in "the sexual slavery of women and the economic dependence of wives."</p>
<p>"For the majority of women, the relatively happy thousands of their own sex in society who receive higher education and pursue high-level professions are problems that have nothing to do with themselves. The improvement of the status of thousands of happy women can never improve the general state of all women." I think I can only end this short article by quoting Bebel's words again. As for what other options Ms. Yan has besides "attempting to end her life by taking poison?" I don't want to point it out. But first, if you want to survive, the illusion of "following" must be shattered, that is necessary.</p>
<h3>The Luxurious Life of the American President</h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>Even if British Prime Minister Baldwin's annual salary is increased from £5,000 to £8,000, it is still much lower than Roosevelt's annual salary. Roosevelt is 54 years old this year, and has now been re-elected as President of the United States. His annual salary, converted to British pounds, is £15,000.</p>
<p>The US President also has an advantage over the British Prime Minister, which is that the magnificent White House in Washington is completely maintained by the government. The President's cars, medicines, and the wages of servants are all paid by the government. Baldwin, however, has to spend £1,000 a year at No. 10 Downing Street, and the salaries of his private secretary, chauffeur, and servants also have to come out of his own pocket.</p>
<p>The US Congress allocates £28,650 annually in the budget for the White House expenses, including repairs, decorations, heating, and lighting. The repairs of No. 10 Downing Street are the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Works, costing only a few hundred pounds each year.</p>
<p>The following items enjoyed by the US President are paid for by the government:</p>
<p>An annual travel expense of £5,000, and a special train is always available for his use. Even laundry expenses are borne by the state, totaling over £1,000 annually. The maintenance of the White House motor pool is almost equal to the President's annual salary. There are a total of twelve chauffeurs, whose wages total £3,500. Their uniforms cost a total of £500. As for the cars, it costs £7,000 annually.</p>
<p>If the President is sick or has a toothache, medical treatment is free of charge. Although there is a resident physician at the White House, all the nursing, medicines, and hospital supplies needed by the President can be enjoyed free of charge. Even medical equipment can be used at will.</p>
<p>The President never sees a bill when traveling and staying in hotels. Even small bills are paid by the state.</p>
<p>The President has a private grooming room, where he goes every morning for grooming. The groomer's wages and the soaps and lotions used are all borne by the government.</p>
<p>Fresh flowers are often placed on the President's breakfast table. About 700 cut flowers are sent to the White House every day. The government pays the head gardener £500 annually, in addition to a large number of ordinary gardeners. When the President needs flowers for banquets, he uses pre-printed cards with the names of the flowers written on them, ordering the gardeners to send them. The printing costs of those cards are also public funds.</p>
<p>The newspapers, books, and magazines read by the President are all provided by the government.</p>
<p>The President has a yacht named the Potomac, which requires a crew of thirty and costs £10,000 to £12,000 annually. President Roosevelt only pays for the food he eats on the ship himself. He can also request a battleship from the Navy or a number of warhorses from the Army.</p>
<p>The White House has twenty-one bedrooms, a gym, and a swimming pool. There is a strangely constructed glass greenhouse in the square, worth five million pounds. If a citizen lived inside and enjoyed this kind of life, they would have to pay taxes of £77,561 annually.</p>
<p>The Cabinet Room where the President meets with state officials was recently renovated. The President sits at the far end of the long table, and Vice President Garner's seat is at the opposite end. Before Roosevelt became President, the Vice President had no seat in the Cabinet Room. After Roosevelt took office, he changed the old rules and also treated loyal and dutiful personnel very well. His courtesy to the Vice President can show a glimpse of this.</p>
<p>Although President Roosevelt lives so luxuriously, his daily life is still simple. He gets up at eight o'clock every morning, has a light breakfast, and then reads the morning newspaper. From 10:30 to 12:00, he meets with state officials and discusses government affairs. The number of people he receives each morning is roughly between fifteen and twenty. He has lunch at twelve o'clock, eating soup, salad, and coffee. Then he discusses government affairs, but in the afternoon he mostly engages in reading documents and handling legislative matters. At dusk, he swims for a while in the swimming pool that was built specifically for him. After dinner, he often retreats to his private room to draft his speeches. His entertainment is very simple. He has a private cinema room where he shows movies twice a week. He loves to watch Mickey Mouse movies the most. His favorite meal is egg drop soup, which his wife always cooks herself on Sunday evenings. This has become a tradition in their thirty years of happy married life.</p>
<h3>In Fengtai</h3>
<p>— Yong Zang</p>
<p>It was already noon when I arrived in Fengtai. Amidst the crisscrossing and chaotic railway tracks, I simply couldn't distinguish which one was the Beining Railway, returning to the embrace of the motherland from the lost territory through the First Pass under Heaven, which one was the Ping绥 Railway, climbing over mountains and ridges from the desolate northwest, and which one was the Pinghan Railway, crossing the two major river basins of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers from the heart of China. Because these three railways converge in Fengtai, turning this desolate village outside the capital city of several decades ago into today's unparalleled stronghold in North China.</p>
<p>About half a mile south of the station, the ×× barracks stood tall. Although it was a row of wooden houses, it was new and solid. On the high pole in the center, the blood-red sun flag fluttered.</p>
<p>At the corner of the main street, a chaotic outcry came. In front of the ×× Imperial Cuisine, two Koreans and a Chinese man were tearing at each other. The Chinese man in his twenties had his clothes torn, his hair disheveled, and his face flushed. The two Koreans knocked him to the ground, but he was still struggling desperately, shouting:</p>
<p>"You damn good-for-nothing, I won't let you live in my house! Why don't you pay the rent? Korean bastards, get out! Damn it, you're bullying people because you have someone to rely on!"</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>"Baga, I'll give you two more years!"</p>
<p>One of the Koreans, a man in his forties with a thick mustache, cursed as he kicked the man with his big leather boots.</p>
<p>By the time I went to the Heshun Inn to eat, the matter was over. The unfortunate Chinese landlord had been arrested and taken to the ×× police station. I pushed my bicycle under the window and said to the waiter:</p>
<p>"What a coincidence, talking about this here, and running into this kind of thing."</p>
<p>"It's not a coincidence at all. These things happen every day. Yesterday, three Koreans beat Gao Laowu at the west end of the street so badly that he was bleeding when he peed. I don't know if he's dead or alive."</p>
<p>The fat cook wiped his hands with his towel and shook his head, saying:</p>
<p>"Alas, the worst is yet to come. Those who came back from outside the pass said that it's illegal to even have a pedicure knife at home..." His voice, thick with phlegm, expressed endless sadness. He foresaw the tragic fate of future subjugated people.</p>
<p>Around five o'clock, the sun slanted westward, and the entire Fengtai sank into gloom. The streets were calm and desolate. A cold wind swept across the fields, and strange bugle calls came from afar. The flag with the red dot was slowly lowered on the high pole. As I looked at the vast distance, I couldn't help but feel a surge of uncontrollable sorrow and indignation in my heart.</p>
<h3>Sparrow</h3>
<p>— Jia</p>
<p>This summer, I got some lotus seedlings from relatives, which were actually lotus roots; but they were not as fresh and tender as the ones you buy to eat, and they were small. But they are the parent plants of next year's lotus flowers, so people call them seedlings.</p>
<p>No one in my family had experience in growing lotus flowers. Although we followed all the planting methods instructed by our relatives: we hired people to carry river mud and added fertilizer, but when lotus seeds were forming in other people's jars, our lotus leaves were still the size of coins, and there were no flower buds at all. A burst of happiness turned to nothing. Moreover, seedlings that don't bloom and bear fruit need to be replaced with new ones next year, otherwise you'll never see a lotus flower that emerges from the mud and remains unstained.</p>
<p>When we turned the jar over, we found that the lotus roots had completely rotted. My mother suspected that there was too much fertilizer, like a patient who is too weak to tolerate tonics, and died as a result.</p>
<p>However, this failure did not cause me any loss. I don't love flowers. But because of the jar of lotus flowers that didn't bloom, it attracted a flock of sparrows, the flock of sparrows called "Ten Sisters." These small, hemp-clad animals are the ones I like among birds. Loving birds and especially loving sparrows may sound like a joke, but my reasons are very sufficient: I am against spending all my time on something I love, and the average bird-keeper is "devoted to serving, until death." That's not loving birds, but being a slave to birds. Among my friends, there are slaves to birds who can't leave their birds all day long. They seem to live for birds. I am against the "birds over people" way of loving birds, but what can I do if someone who doesn't love flowers happens to like birds, so I fell in love with sparrows.</p>
<p>You don't have to bother to catch sparrows in a golden cage. Even if you're happy to catch a few and keep them in a cage, you don't have to worry about them. Just put some food and change a bowl of clean water every day, and they will live freely and naturally. Unlike those—I can't even name them all, one instance of improper care, and they'll turn belly-up and lie on their backs in the cage.</p>
<p>Sparrows seem to be everywhere, but after you especially like sparrows, you rarely see them active. They like to roost on top of desolate pagodas, on the roofs of dilapidated temples, or in abandoned nests left by other birds. My home is not a temple, and there are no pagodas nearby, and other birds are rarely seen, so these sparrows, which can be seen everywhere, seem precious. The jar of lotus flowers that didn't bloom had some charm that attracted a flock of "Ten Sisters."</p>
<p>They are called "Ten Sisters," but there aren't necessarily ten of them, it's just a flock. According to common practice, "three" can represent a majority, and "ten" can naturally represent a flock. They came in flocks like that. At first, they shyly hid in the corners of the walls, as if discussing whether they could go down, seeing that the jar with floating green leaves seemed to have plenty of food. Then one, which must be the leader, ventured down from the corner of the wall, flew over the wire rack holding up the mouth of the jar, stood on the edge of the jar, pecked at the swimming insects on the surface of the water, happily shook its hemp clothes, and chirped to greet its subordinates.</p>
<p>From then on, the lotus flower jar was their colony. They practiced on the edge of the jar without fear. They came quickly and left quickly. I still can't figure out where their camp is located. But it is certain that there is a comfortable nest nearby. Now that the lotus seedlings have rotted, they still come several times a day, lingering in the corners of the walls.</p>
<p>I once thought about catching them and playing with them for a few days. Next year, I'll go to my relatives' house to get some seedlings to plant a few more jars of lotus flowers.</p>
<p>My family's old maid hates the "Ten Sisters" the most, because they leave droppings in the courtyard where clothes are dried. So, she also blamed them for the lotus flowers not forming lotus seeds, saying that they pecked the tender seedlings to death. The old maid is looking forward to snow every day, hoping to see them all freeze to death in the snow, and has already made a bird-catching cage, preparing to catch them and make them into snacks to go with wine.</p>
<p>I think my desire to catch them has become even stronger. I want to catch them and keep them for the winter.</p>

<p>Opening "Plum Blossom" - Reporting Spring at the Head of All Flowers. Opened at Yu Ridge, bright and dazzling. Good style in front of the Jade Reflection Hall. Pointing to freshness in the Hanzhang Hall. Top grade of the Imperial Garden pushing Zi Di. Qi Li cooking elixir, gold not yet complete. A touch of rouge, cheeks thin. Friendship deeper than pine and bamboo across the river. Lightly fragrant snow, smoky and cold. Misty frozen clouds, fence and wall dim. Collecting clouds, a heart-to-heart knot. Horizontal jade perch, affectionate passion. Yangzhou scenery is remembered in vain. Leisurely chanting in the East Pavilion, interest rises on its own. The principles are the same on branches north and south. But the opening and falling are different. Light makeup welcomes and sends off the Luofu dream. Startled by the cry of the kingfisher after being drunk. The recluse of Gushan has deep feelings. Remember visiting the eaves with a smile. Snow as friends is easy to dissipate. Frost as matchmaker, message sinks. Jade butterflies fluttering and gathering on the branches. White sleeves and plain clothes welcome each other with joy. The beautiful appearance should live on the Yao Terrace. Once came to the villages by the stream. In the dream, pear flowers are difficult to distinguish. Flattering words do not hinder the uprightness of Guangping. Three thatched cottages, a thousand trees blooming. The sound of flutes is heard in Jiangcheng in May. Green leaves form shade to bear fruit. Where to find the secluded soul in the cold fragrance. Send a branch far away to trouble the postman. Staring at the end of the world, missing old friends. It's better to teach Jiangbei and Jiangnan to miss each other diligently.</p>

<p>Opening "Luoshen"</p>
<p>Smoke and clouds are misty, the goddess of Luochuan. Emerald feathers, bright earrings, graceful and peerless. She is, walking lightly on the waves, flowers graceful. Across the water, far and gracefully. But seeing her, Xiang skirt white silk as bright as snow. But seeing her, emerald sleeves fluttering in the wind, dancing belt light. But seeing her, cloud-like hair, hairpin tied with phoenix. But seeing her, slender waist like a cut jade, slender and graceful. But seeing her, bright eyes and white teeth, smile containing affection. But seeing her, dark eyebrows, resembling a belt of anger. Loving only loving, like a startled swan, attentive and considerate. Pleased only pleased, looking across the waves, demeanor gentle and kind. Loving her even more, after dressing neatly, silence. Chen Si, with no burden, wrote a portrait for her. Sea of thoughts and clouds of sorrow, many fantasies. Envy his wonderful writing of heavenly people. Who is a companion for the immortal couple in a dream? Only left, the embroidered curtain removed, spring at the corner of the sea. Pavilions are empty, lingering in dreams. For thousands of years, the temple appearance recommends Qingping. Only gains, the sound of the wind fluttering the spirit flag, dutiful and dutiful.</p>

<p>The romantic and magnanimous Shi Xiangyun. At the family banquet, she swallowed a hundred cups. Drunk as mud, escaped the banquet. For a time, the young ladies were anxious. Iron shoes worn out, nowhere to be found. Who knew, she was drunk and sleeping on a red fragrant peony bed. Petals flying around, red and greasy. Bees and butterflies circling around her body, invading her defeated appearance. She is, her eyes closed slightly, pillow tilted. Mumbling the wine order non-stop. Half-undone creamy chest revealing a naive attitude. The smell of wine pungent, weak and difficult to suppress. Xiang skirt lying on the ground, stained with dirt. Silk fan discarded, tired appearance presented. Full of nonsense, difficult to distinguish. Waving jade arms wildly, emitting coquettishness. Seven points drunk, three points tired. Letting him, pitying jade and cherishing fragrance, but unable to wake her. The sisters in the garden were anxious. Brother Bao, afraid of people joking, secretly worried. At the time of waking up from the wine, sitting with shame. Smoothing her cloud-like hair, brushing her clothes. Alarmed, the protective bell sounded in the east.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Grand Theater Re-Releases "The Vengeful Affair"</h3>
<p>"The Vengeful Affair," Pushkin's famous work ("Dubrovsky"), when it premiered in Shanghai earlier this month, many people missed it due to ticket prices. Therefore, the Shanghai Grand Theater, after the film's premiere in Tianjin, has decided to re-release it for two days starting today, with ticket prices starting from twenty cents.</p>
<p>This is a literary film commemorating the centenary of Pushkin's death. Various newspapers have already published many reviews about it, so there is no need to say more here. However, the newsreel "Gorky's Funeral" is being screened simultaneously with the film, which is noteworthy.</p>
<p>In addition to its premiere in Shanghai, the film, as mentioned above, has also been shown in Tianjin. After its second release in Shanghai, it will be transported to Nanjing for screening.</p>
