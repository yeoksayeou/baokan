<h3 id="c14">日本對華外交之趨向 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 紀</p>
<p>近頃關於日本對華外交有三事最足爲吾人注意者一爲有田八郞之使華二爲日駐華武官磯谷於會見蔣院長張外長後奉命急遽返國向軍部作重要報吿並貢獻其對華政策之具體意見三爲外務陸軍海軍三省行將召集對華聯席會議而駐華陸海軍關係則正在進行調整就第一項言有田隸重光實力派系統之下且曾旅華多年力主「對支强硬論」與軍部聲氣相投此番奉命使華實爲重光派握有對華外交全權之實質的表現就第二項言磯谷有軍部少壯派色彩此行頗足影響日本對華全部之基本態度就第三項言可知今後日本擬以對內妥協之陣綫建立一海陸軍及產業資本家態度一致之外交方針以一掃從前漸進主義與急進主義意見之鑿枘南京中心主義與華北中心主義方針之對立矣</p>
<p>日本對華外交旣有明顯之新趨向日本軍部與外部對華方針之恊議自亦倍形忙碌川島陸相連日與參謀本部首腦人員恊議對華策略及應付滿蒙糾紛之方法同時召見此决回國之日駐津參謀長酒井參謀池田聽取華北現狀之報吿並詳細研究日駐屯軍對華北之態度中日「滿」之經濟提携防共恊定之交涉華北駐軍之强化等問題日外務省亦召集會議决定對華方針爲「以東亞主義爲基礎遂行中國中心之政策」日武官磯谷則於六日啣軍部之命訪唔重光交換對於中國時局之意見至華北方面多田司令正與旅順司令和田商討擴充華北港口問題以期海陸兩部在華北有經常之聯絡凡此種種事態均足爲上述三種觀點之旁證也</p>

<p>以東亞門羅主義為基礎　改善中日關係共同防赤</p>
<p>東京　退出軍縮會議後之日本外交根本政策、已於第六十八决議會廣田外相演說外交方針之演辭中、明白表示、茲為調整實行上之細節具體方案起見、連日舉行陸海軍與外務之三省連絡事務會議、恊議極其愼重、確聞三省完全意見一致之主要方案如下、</p>
<p>海軍成為無條的時代、並非求而得之者、是以日本在無條約之中、自應極力廻避惹起所豫料之建艦自由競爭、</p>
<p>中日兩國關係、在乎中國對於「滿洲國」存在之認識若何、漸决當可改善、中日提携與共同防衛赤化、乃為日本實行東亞政策上不可或缺之要件、自常提早向實現之道邁進者也、</p>
<p>日本對於海軍問題及中國問題之眞意、認為漸决可獲各國之諒解、對於英美兩國、允以要求通商自由、以便除去威脅和平之原因、</p>
<p>遠東赤軍乃對於「滿洲國」常施威脅者也、蘇聯赤化工作、乃對於日本東亞政策之根本障碍也、是以劃定滿蘇國界、與撤退遠東赤軍、及完成日華兩國共同防衛赤化之陣容、必可防止日蘇兩國間發生不祥事實、此為吾人所確信者也、上項日本對外政策、均立足於不威脅不侵略之原則、實由於躍進之日本、以其自然膨脹力、而以和平手段、使之散布於四海者也、故不許世界任何國家、行使非法之進展、蓋束亞當認為係東亞人之東亞、而漸决以之確立世界之永久和平者也云、（七日同盟電）</p>
<p>東京　昨為處理滿蘇與滿蒙邊境糾紛、决定對蘇政策起見、已於六日在外務省舉行陸海外三省協議會、討論之結果、頗有强硬意見存乎其間、至日蘇兵士衝突事件、當待事態明白以後、由外務當局判斷其曲直、或於下星期向蘇聯政府提抗議、或喚起注意、關於上項等情、業經意見一致、茲錄於下、</p>
<p>日本政府根據不威脅不侵略之善鄰政策、努力與蘇聯維持和平友好之關係、而圖增進親善、</p>
<p>根據上項主義、認為邊界糾紛事伴之根本處理、當以劃定其不明確之邊界、為第一義、倘蘇聯政府希望講求處理糾紛之手段與方法、則雙方開始商議自屬無妨、</p>
<p>至於邊境錢上之不安定、乃由於蘇聯方面擴充不需要之龐大軍備為原因、當不待言、應促蘇聯方面之反省、</p>
<p>以上各節、卽係調整對蘇關係之態度、業經確立、蘇聯方面之言動、雖含有刺激性、而其衷心則極度恐怖日本之反攻、蘇聯駐日大優列尼夫氏曾於去年八月十七日向日本提議之設立邊境糾紛處理委員會、每遇有機會、卽行重提於此可見、東鄕歐亞局長在該項恊議會後、對於重光决官報吿其經過、考究對蘇交涉之具體方策、結局關於衝突事伴、將由大田大使向蘇聯政府提抗議、並對於根絕糾紛、說明日方之方針、要求其反省、調整邊境糾紛問題之第二步、將於東京由廣田外相與優列尼夫大使繼續去年中止之交涉也、（七日同盟電）</p>

<h3 id="c93">中國極應舉辦之　生物調查與研究事業 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— 胡先驌</p>
<p>國家之富源，不外有機無機二大類。無機部分，如水力則屬於工程範圍，礦產則屬於地質範圍（煤興煤油尚為有機物所變成不過為礦產耳；）有機部分則屬於生物範圍，包括動植物兩項。而生物之應用，則與人生一切之衣食住行生老病死，莫不相關，大要可分為工業農業醫藥三類。與工業有關者，如皮革纖維紙張人造絲炸藥油漆木材等是。與農業有關者，則畜牧漁業農作物園藝作物病蟲害釀造等是。興醫藥有關者，則生藥寄生蟲及一切生理病理研究是。生物學之應用，既如是之廣，故不得不強為區分。考諸歐美各國，如關於人生醫藥之研究，多由衛生機關主持之；與農業有直接關係之研究，則由農業機關主持之；關於漁業，則由水產機關主持之；關於森林，以其範圍較大，則由林業機關主持之；關於昆蟲，則亦每每有國立昆蟲局以主持其事。此外有多種生物學研究，非必能直接應用，而興應用又每有密切之關係者，則每有另立專門學術機關以主持之者，如英國之邱皇家植物園，美國農部之植物實業局與生物調查所國立博物院，俄國之應用植物研究所等是。共事業之大小，職權之輕重，每以歷史之背景因襲而定，殊無一定之規則也。然在科學發達之國家，深知純粹科學之研究，驟視之似與應用無密切之關係，然每每自純粹科學研究中，忽然有極重要之應用結果發現，如蘇俄之發現產橡皮代用品之植物，浙江見蟲局發現巴豆可以為極重要之殺蟲劑皆是也。通常研究應用之生物科學者，如農林漁牧專家，對於動植物等根本科學，常無深造，故每每須求助於純粹研究之動植物學者。歐美各先進國家，有見於此，故提倡生物學研究，不遺餘力。如英國之邱皇家植物園，為英國規模最大成績最優之科學機關；俄國之應用植物研究所，每年經費至百萬盧布；美國之國立生物調查所，規模亦極宏大；即是故也。吾國生物學研究歷史甚短，雖現在有研究所六七，而成續皆頗優；然經費則極支絀，而有多種研究，本可在專門應用之機關，如農業研究所等內研究者，而以百廢待舉，人才興經費皆不充裕，在此類機關中，無法進行。是在國家認定何種生物學研究為中國今日之急務，或另立機關主持其事，或資助現有之生物研究機關，使之担任此項工作，則收效之大而且速，可以逆覩矣</p>
<p>關於亟應辦理之生物調查與研究事業，的有下列諸項：</p>
<p>（一）關於森林之研究</p>
<p>吾國提倡林業已久，而成效不著者，有三大原因：第一，學森林者對於中國之樹木，未嘗研究，故吾國產何種樹木，興各種樹木之產量分布與面積，皆無從調查。第二，既不能辨別樹木之品種，自不能研究木材之物理與化學性質，一切木材利用之研究，皆無從下手。第三，不辨樹種，當然不能研究各種樹木之造林需要。故在過去所有造林事業，皆等於盲人說燭也。欲救其弊，必需下列各種工作：</p>
<p>（甲）調查樹種與編纂全國樹木圖誌</p>
<p>中國樹木種類極繁，在北美洲樹木不過六百餘種，在中國則已知之樹木的二千種，而年年有新種發現。有一新屬，在過去四年間，竟發現新種八種之多。然尚有多數較為僻遠之省區，未經詳細探採。在美國與日本以及安南，昔年其政府皆曾以大力調查樹種，編纂巨大精美森林植物圖誌，吾國自不宜再事落後。幸國內各生物研究機關，皆有長期之採集研究；若再指撥一宗較巨之欵，專供此用，如美國農部，委託哈佛大學阿諾德森林植物院，以編纂北美樹木誌者，則十年之內，不難成此偉大事業也</p>
<p>（乙）調查森林之面積</p>
<p>與調查樹種可以同時進行者，厥為調查森林之面積。現在各省所有之森林，為何種樹木所組成？某種森林占面積若干？皆未曾有大規模之調查。此種調查，乃急不容緩之工作。若全國皆有此項調查，則欲利用某種木材之時，不難按圖索驥，且可知其林積若干，足以供偌大市塲，而可定開發之計畫也。</p>
<p>（丙）試騐材性與鑑別木材</p>
<p>用木材解剖性質以鑑別木材之種類，其重要與調查樹種相若。此項工作，自吾國提創造林三十餘年，無人曾於此致力。此項研究，為靜生生物調查所所創始，計曾經採集之木材，來自河北江西，四川，雲南，貴州，廣東，廣西，各省，而曾經研究其木材解剖者，共有四百餘種。重要之軟木硬木材，幾於各屬皆已具備，已粗奠此項研究之基礎。若能增加此項研究之經費，而假以時日，則全國所有之樹木之木材解剖，皆可研究竣事，而森林家與工業家乃有南針矣。至於材性試騐，則以須購買木材試騐機，且須採集大宗木材，以供試騐，所費甚巨，故在靜生生物調查所，一時未能進行此項工作。然四百餘種木材之比重，已經研究完畢。此類研究，已經開始。其他工業研究機關，雖亦有作此項研究者然以無人能辨認樹種，得材不易，故未能為大規模之研究。若撥專欵購買木材試騐機，及供大規模採集之用，則中國一切木材利用之基礎，可以奠定，而工業用軍用造紙枕木各項木材，皆知從所取材矣。</p>
<p>（丁）造林學研究</p>
<p>今日造林，皆未經試騐而妄作者，故結果不佳，而每每失敗。是宜搜集所有重要樹木之種子，以研究其造林之需要，俾將來實際造林者，有所遵循。又如今日歐美各國，方提飢以雜種白楊造林，蓋其生長極速，十五年之生長，可抵其他樹木五十年。將來若經研究其風土宜忌之後，用以大規模造林，不難在吾國林業中發生一種革命，而造紙以及其他木材問題，皆可解决矣。（未完）</p>

<p>定義　傳染病這個名詞，想來民衆已有了相當的認識。關於傳染病的內容，若按疾病的性質分析可分為直接傳染與間接傳染兩種。若以時間來分，又有所謂「流行病」的一說，這是因某種傳染病，在某一個季節流行的最厲害，有時稱為「大流行」，如流行性感胃與流行性腦脊髓膜炎等。更有幾種傳染病常在某一地區流行的比較利害，換一個地方或立即停止傳染。這是以地域來分，又名之曰「地方病」。傳染病的病理，早經許多醫學專家研究實騐，都一致說疾病各有其致病之原因。概括地說：傳染病各有素因及其媒介，如病人及其用具以及害蟲如蛟蠅蚤蝨等，動物如鼠犬等。更有一種人，他自己並沒有病狀，可是他能夠將病菌傳染別人，我們叫這種人為「帶菌者」。總而言之：疾病的發生，都有他各別的原因，傳染病更有其傳染的途徑。同時預防方法也隨之不同。傳染病傳佈的途徑，的可分為四類，茲特分述如次：</p>
<p>一。接觸組，這組所要說的病，第一要算是天花，天花的病源是一種濾過性的微生體，此病的傳染，當以接觸病人最容易，其决如病人將愈時之口鼻排洩物，玩具及病人之衣被等，也能為傳染之媒介。第二是痳疹，痳疹係兒童最易傳染的疾病，木病病原仍未大明，傳染途徑略同天花。第三是腦膜炎，這種病原係一種雙球菌，傳染途徑大多數係直接接觸病人或與帶菌者接近而傳染。此外如猩紅熱。花柳病。皮膚病。沙限等，都屬於由接觸而傳染的疾病。</p>
<p>二。呼吸器組，這組所要說的病，第一要算白喉，白喉的病原係一種桿菌侵入咽喉部，如與患者或帶菌者接吻，握手，談話，固可以傳染，接觸了病人的食品，用具，碗筷等物，也易傳染。第二是流行性感胃，感胃的病原至今仍未確定，但流行頗速，在未經受染之民族，患本病而死者極衆，一九一八至一九一九年數月之閒全世界感胃大流行，受染者達二萬萬人，死者在千萬人以上，在美國不足半年，病者二千萬人，死者四十餘萬。一九一八年六月至十一月，五個月之間，印度患本病死者達四百餘萬，但已染過本病之民族則病率雖高，死亡率並不高。傳染途徑則與白喉相同。其次為肺炎，病原係肺炎桿菌，傳染途徑與白喉感胃相近，但因過勞，受寒，傷風等也能誘起本病。此外如接觸組之疾病，有時由呼吸器亦能傳染。</p>
<p>三。消化器組，關於消化器部分的傳染病，有霍亂，傷寒及類傷寒，赤痢等這三種病的病原，都是病菌作祟，傳染的途徑也差不多完全相同。不過霍亂最厲害，死亡率很高。記得民國甘一年，我國全國霍亂大流行，患者總數達十五萬餘人，死者亦有五萬餘人。據統計學家云：從統計方面推測霍亂病每五年大流行一决，民國甘一年既有大流行，甘六年恐仍將有流行之可能，這要看預防工作如何了。其决傷寒及類傷寒，這個病的病歷經過較緩，但在中國流行得非常普過，任何地方隨時可見病人。在各文明先進國家，因公共衛生設施的完備，傷寒等病幾已絕跡。社會如發生傷寒病者，醫學校始有見習的機會。赤痢病可分為兩種，病的性質也不同，一為菌性痢，流行於夏秋兩季，治療及預防均易着手。一為阿米巴痢又名原蟲性痢，患者時輕時重，易成慢性病，但不易流行，至於傳染的途徑，三種病大致都是由於暴飲暴食，飲用生水及不潔之冷飲食而起，還有不良的環境如蒼蠅多，處置污物不得當，也能使疾病傳佈。此外如一般腸胃病，起原多數由於飲食的習慣，尚有待改善。</p>
<p>四。接種組，有幾種傳染病，一定要經過一種中間宿主，如　疾病必先經蚊體孕育，然後再傳染到人體，其中很有一段可述的情節，即傳染瘧疾的蚊，吸吮人血的時候，牠必先將牠體內的液體吐出，然後再吸人的血，假設牠吐出的液血中有瘧原蟲時，那麼被蚊叮的人，就有發生瘧疾的可能。其决屬於寄生蟲類的疾病，如黑熱症大的是由白蛤子為中間宿主，這些寄生蟲有藉昆蟲的媒介或直接鑽入皮膚，或藉糞便排出體外，再由食物遞進消化道，直達內臟。或在腸，或在肺，或在肝，或在血裹來滋生繁殖以攝取人體的營養液，破壞組織，產生毒素或閉塞管道而發生種種的生理障碍。這一類的疾病因具傳染性，所以也叫做傳染病。</p>
<p>預防傳染的病現我們曉得了以後，再進一步。就要知道預防的衛生方法。現在分為兩方面來講述。甲。個人方面：傳染病並不是空中樓閣，都是有他傳染的因素，同時傳染的時候，又各有其媒介物。所以講到預防也應分類說明——接觸組的傳染病，健康的人第一要與患者分離，此即醫學界常說的「隔離」二字，遇有類似的病人，亦應不與之握手談話等。第二實行預防接種，如種牛痘可以防免天花，腦膜炎可實行注射疫苗之類。腸胃組傳染病的預防方法，應注意日常的飲食，水不沸過不飲，同時生冷的飲料必須先知是由熱水製成的，飲食應注意新鮮，對於飲食應養成一種很好的衛生習慣，腸胃組傳染病或可以防止了。必要的時候也可以實行預防注射。預防呼吸系的傳染病，除對於息者實行隔離以外，還有熱鬧場所最好少去參與，至於接種組的傳染病，個人應隨時注意環境的淸潔，遇有可疑的飲食，最好不用；對於傳染病的媒介物如蚊蠅蝨蚤鼠等要隨時撲滅，這樣就可避免最常見的幾種傳染病了，若是某人被傳染某種病菌，有時還要看個人的疾病抵抗力如何，平時注意個人衛生的人，如有良好的營養，適宜的起居，抵抗力增強，疾病就不容易發出來了。乙。公衆方面：我們知道個人實行預防疾病的方法，比較容易實行和有效，但是社會環境太壞，各個人的環境不同，所以預防傳染病的方法也隨之不同，第一要注意的就是：</p>
<p>一。環境改善　社會的環境衛生設施，包括有　厠所問題——一般公共厠所，建造應有防蠅的紗窗紗門，同時要注意管理淸潔或按時消毒，對於一般不合衛生的厠所應切實指導改良，以期厠所建造和管理適宜而減少蒼蠅之孳生。　飲食問題——腸胃組的傳染病，由飲水而發生的成分較多，所以社會有安全水（自來水）的供給，這就是公共衛生問醫。上海市每屆夏令，必開放自來水，免費供給一般貧民享用，因此近年來，腸胃組的傳染病人減少。這是防病最妥當的方法，不過沒有自來水的地方很多，最理想的，應該促成各地方裝設起自來水來，退一步的辦法，就是想法淸潔水源，飲水消毒，以及指導人民養成喝開水的習慣等。　污物垃圾處置問題——一般人對於處置污物垃圾等，尚不知注意，所以社會應有負責機關或人員，來消毀一切的污物垃圾等，以保持社會的環境衛生。　撲減蚊蠅問題——蛟蠅鼠犬等，均為傳染病的媒介，所以環境衛生設施，應注意隨時隨地的撲減蚊蠅及捕殺野犬及鼠類之工作，關於環境衛生事項，仍有很多，如房犀建築，透光通氣，以及一般團體中之安全設備等。</p>
<p>二。醫藥預防　醫藥方面的預防工作，即利用人工免疫的道理，來按照季節作有組織有系統的預防接種的工作。預防接種就是打防疫針及種牛痘，現在為世人所公認為有特效的，如種牛痘可以防免天花。注射傷寒霍亂混合疫苗可以防免傷寒及霍亂，注射白喉類毒素可以防免白喉之類，凡屬社會有公共衛生機關的地方，都應有這種醫藥方面防止傳染病的設施。</p>
<p>三。衛生教育　傳染病學理上的研究，這是很難的一件事。但是傳染病的病原和病理，都很簡單，上一節已經講過。至於預防方法，個人方面固然不算一件難事，唯有希望全社會人人一致的來實行，這件事唯有採用教育的方式，使得人人知道傳染病的知識和防止傳染病的方法。這就是衛生教育最大目標之一，然而提起衛生教育來，仍有訓練應用的衛生工作人員，以便推廣防疫的範圍。還有民衆應把所得的知識傳播開來。</p>
<p>綜上三點都已超越於個人的能力範圍，這必須政府或公共團體負責推行，才能收效，因此附帶發生的一個問題，就是地方政府對於推行公共衛生的組織，實有提出討論的必要。現在各地方政府，多在公安局之內設有衛生科，只在消極方面作一些醫藥方面的取締工作，這是不能應付今日社會需要的，現在各省陸續成立全省衛生實騐處，各市成立衛生局，各縣成立衛生院或縣立醫院，但仍有多數省市縣未能推動有詠劃的公共衛生工作，這是在防止傳染問題上最重要的一個先決問題。</p>
<p>治療　傳染病的治療法，現已有特效的，如金鷄霜治療瘧疾，有機含砒藥品如用九一叫治療梅毒，山道年治療蛔蟲等。這是人人已經知道了。其他疾病治療法，白喉血淸治療　常複雜，說起來恐非短時間說得完的茲暫不多介紹。但有幾種病，在科學方面現仍沒有特效的藥可以治療，可是從護理病人的生活方面入手，也能使病狀漸愈以至於康復。如傷寒病只要節制病的飲食，使病人完全臥床休養，這就是護病技術暫代治療的一種方法。還有麻疹，這個病也是沒有特效的藥，可以治療。只有用護病方法，來保持病人住室平衡的溫度，不使發生其他併發病，病人在相當時間內也自然可以痊愈，此外有許多種傳染病，治療方面或尚有待於藥物研究發明的，或竟用飲食營養以代治療的，這正是現代醫學演進的情形。</p>
<p>結論　傳染病的治療法，我們知道有特效藥品的可以說很少，同時因社會環境的不良，傳染病傳佈的機會非常之多，若等有病再請醫治療，時間經濟都非所宜。何況我國醫師人數的分怖亦不可能。所以今日欲談民族健康問題，防止傳染病的工作恐怕要比疾病治療勝強數千百倍吧！防止傳染的工作既較治療為重要，不過防病的工作必須政府與人民合作，人民要切實實行健康的生活，政府也應努力衛生的建設，那末，人類的生活，才能逐漸的進步，社會的文明才能日新月異。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c164">冠生園農塲參觀記 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 錢華</p>
<p>冠生園三字、已深深的印入一般人的心中了。尤其是小朋友們，都希望家長替他們帶些冠生園出品的糖菓餅乾回來。三四位朋友要找一家幽雅可口小吃的地方，也有到冠生園去的口號。冠生園的成功是創辦人冼冠生先生的一部奮鬥史。從幾百塊錢的小吃食舖，擴充為五十萬元資本的大公司，現在全國共有總支店十四處，工廠二，農場梅林各一，全部職工數千人，眞是談何容易。</p>
<p>記者於去冬十二月二十二日偕同館以，曾到漕河涇冠生園農場參觀過一次，設備和佈置等項，都相當令人滿意。領導參觀的講述冠生園創辦的經過和現狀，他說：「冠生園的創辦人冼冠生先生是廣東南海人，出身很寒微。十六歲那年在五馬路上一家食品店裏學徒，滿帥後，凑合了一些小資本，在滬南新舞台的左側開了一家小食品店—冠香。後來新舞台遷到畝地去，於是冠香亦因營業清淡而關門大吉。四年後又在南京路永安公司原址開了一家陶陶居食品店，不到年餘，因為房屋本身的需要拆造，不得不又宣告了停業。民國七年就和伶界的舊友夏月珊，鄭正秋等拚凑了幾百塊錢，組織冠生園。改變營業方針，提倡小販生利，營業大振。最初出品僅有陳皮梅，果汁結汁牛肉等數種。翌年在斜橋局門路，自建工廠，於漢口設支局，出品日增，推銷也愈廣，民國十二年擴充資本為十萬元，改組有限公司，民國十六年，又增資五萬元，年終營業總額，突破百萬元紀錄。民國二十年，又增資十五萬元，連前共成三十萬元。二十一年開始計劃食品原料的自給，在漕河涇闢農場，在浙屬超山，添置梅林。二十三年復增資二十萬元，連前共五十萬元，是年營業總額為二百七十餘萬，在去年不景氣潮流中，營業上也有相當的進展。</p>
<p>記者參觀的漕河涇農場，佔地約四十餘畝，種值許多蔬菜瓜果，供給冠生園各店飲食部製菜之用。復於隙地，建造亭軒，鑿池引泉，疊石架山，塲的中央設飲食部，專供郊外呼吸着大自然的新鮮空氣，處身美麗景色中，精神為之一振，眞有說不出的愉快。因為是冬令的緣故，那天雖是星期日，而游伴祇是我們幾個，清靜冷落，更顯出幽雅宜人。農塲的一小部份劃作金魚園，四週團着竹籬，進門的地方有一塊橫頭書魚游天三字。裏面有池沼，魚缸，蓄養着五色繽紛的各種大小不同金魚數千尾，奇種珍品，搜羅宏富，彷彿遊覽北平中央公園和天橋金魚園，確值得欣賞。南方天氣較暖，冬令魚缸可暴露日光下，不必移藏空內，省却不少麻煩。</p>
<p>農塲的西部有四層高樓一所，是冠生園漕河涇糖果餅乾廠。佔地六十方尺，全用水泥鋼骨築成，外形為立體式，氣象頗為雄偉。內部第一層前進為辦公處，後進為鍋爐房。第二層為製造餅乾部，第三層為包裝部，第四層為糖果部，均用電力發動，確是現代新式工廠。各部男女職工奔走工作，十分緊張，都穿着白布制服，戴白帽，清潔衛生。製造餅乾部有美國最新式的烘焙爐數架，每架每小時可造成餅乾一千多磅。此外有最新式餅乾印模機國十餘副，甜，鹹，夾心等花色餅乾都可任意配用，機器的正件是從歐洲運來，副件在滬自行配製。各部參觀畢，在望梅軒內休息一下，茶役光上濃茶，各人嚐那剛剛製成的各種餅乾滋味，談論着農塲將來發展的計劃，窗外看到着前梅樹數株幹蒼秀，疏影橫斜，頗覺心曠神怡。我們一行向領導者道謝後，留戀不舍進乘車歸來</p>

<p>眞如首得五球　列陣跳球時、海賊之危險人物蘭茵未出場、由白乃特暫任其職、未曾一回合、鄺耀雅在籃下、接得蔡濱雄來球一托而入、以後韓蔡二人、前抄後襲、均兩度建樹、俄傾之間、即十對○、光耀一時、</p>
<p>海賊方得一分　一班賊軍、在皮失爾憑罰球、方得一分以後、見勢不佳、蘭茵開到生力軍、白乃特退休、在眞如鋒銳之軍勢下、依然無多發展被尹·韓·鄺·王旁敲側擊、疊有潤色、對方則蘭茵亦已幾度托入、休息時間已畢、眞如以廿一對十二遙居高峯、</p>
<p>蘭英心隨手願　更易防區、爭端又啟、海賦大獻其打家刦舍慣技、加以長人蘭茵之跳球心隨手願、我方任何能者總非彼敵、於是前鋒衝刺大占便宜、瞬息之間、彼之兩史及卡、皮等聲東擊西一鼓而中七球、比數遂以二六對廿一、一躍登先、</p>
<p>雙方造成平手　處茲萬方多難中、眞如更變戰略力圖反攻、王鄘·韓三投三中、局勢漸漸峯迥路轉、蔡演雄在亂軍中特建奇績、復又遠射中的、乃造成三十之春色平分、</p>

<p>財政狀况未恢復前</p>
<p>各項經費仍須緊縮</p>
<p>公共租界工部局敎育處一九三六年之概算、前經學務委員會於一月二十一日及二十八日、兩决開會討論、建議於董事會、嗣經董事會批交財務委員會審核、茲特先將其的略、探要披露於下、</p>
<p>敎育經費臨時支出方面、有西童預擬添築房屋二所、一爲愚園路西童女校之烹飪針黹室、一爲西童小學之大會堂、及其他小部份之改築、前者原擬建造二層樓樓房一所、財務處處長力言目前財政狀况奇窘、此等建築連同小學之大會堂等、均應暫緩舉行、惟學務委員會主席則堅持烹飪室之不宜再緩、結果折衷其議、擬撥烹飪室建築費二萬五千元、作爲甲種急要經費、至小學會堂一節、則暫不置議、惟便利學生放置自行車起見、應即搭蓋蓆棚一座、費用自三百元至四百元、此欵亦已列入甲等急要項下、</p>
<h3 id="c178">經常費用華校部份 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>至經常費用華童學校部份、匯山路東區小學、學生人數比率不高、財務處處長詢問敎職員方面、有無减少之可能、敎育處處長稱該校學生人數、自上决財務處處長報吿之後、已自四百零五名、增至四百二十五名、且學額有限、係因於敎室之狹小、若以現狀而論、人員實無减縮之可能、該校概算當即照原議通過、</p>
<p>華德路小學、學生人數增加、依財務處處長原議、擬自東區小學調動敎員一人至該校、惟旣以東區小學人員、暫無减縮之可能、勢不得不添聘教員一人、該校原有概算、及添聘敎員一人之估計、全部通過、</p>
<p>文監師路新設華童半日學校、原擬開七班、聘敎員十二人、財務處處長覺敎員人數、無需十二人之多、學務委員會主席常即聲明、該校每星期開課六足日、學生總數三百五十名、每日分早晚二班、各上課三小時、故敎員十二人恐已甚覺疲於工作、學務處處長則稱、該校尙未開學、現巳招取學生三百十八名、此尙屬試辦性質、將來敎員究應用若干人、現尙難加臆斷、惟將來應竭力撙節從事云、</p>
<p>以上各項概算連同敎育處經常費用、以及其他各小學及夜校之經常費用、俾已通過交財務委員會審查矣、</p>

<p>新加坡路女子中學原擬本年添聘敎員四人、後改三人、計一月中聘一人、秋季九月再聘二人、惟財務處對此、力持異議、學務委員會某委、稱該校有確實之收入、故彼認爲必需之支出、不應復靳而不與、主席亦謂該校學生旣已增加、敎員似無必不可加之理、結果决定於秋季、加聘敎員一人、惟須視當時情形爲定、此案修正後、遂與其他各中學經常支出概算、一律通過建議於董事會矣、</p>
<p>工部局設立師範學校、前已由敎育處處長建議停辦、惟一九三六年概算中、該校經費總數二千九百元、仍經列入、嗣敎育委員會各華委主張、以該項經費、添設女子夜校一所於東區、財務處處長稱、彼對於添設女子夜校之主張、並不反對、惟經費不應超過師範學校原有二千九百元之額、結果决定師範學校停辦、其經費二千九百元移作添設女子夜校一所之用云、</p>
<h3 id="c180">西童各校概算情形 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>據西童裝小學原有計劃、擬於本年春秋二季各添聘敎員一人、嗣該校校長以春季學生人數增加並不甚鉅、遂建議僅於秋季添聘敎員一人、據財務處處長之意、即秋季添聘之敎員亦屬無需、敎育處處長則謂秋季學生人數倘有激增之時、如不添加敎員、勢須拒絕新生之加入、結果決定本年秋季倘學生人數增加者、　應自九月一日始添聘一年級助敎一人、其經費應先列入預算案中云、</p>
<p>再則財務處處長對於其他西童各校生額、曾於其報吿書中表示不滿之意、謂現在生額及敎育單位之比率、爲每單位僅有學生二十一名、倘長此不增、則敎員人數應即减少、或於敎員應得長假之中、不另聘代課之敎員云、經經學務委員會議决、此事應由敎育處處長擬具報吿書、交由委員會核辦、</p>
<p>以上各項敎育槪算、除尙須經財務處審核者外均已通過交由財務委員會審核矣、</p>

<p>— Louisa　M.　Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>第九章　人間遺愛</p>
<p>「醒醒，小橋，寶！我要你來」。</p>
<p>「啊，我剛到床上；這當還沒到天亮呢」，小橋說著，他從他第一决的熟睡中醒來，霎眼像一隻小猫頭鷹一般。</p>
<p>「這祗不過十點鐘，可是你父親病了，我們須得去看他，啊，我可憐的小喬恩，我可憐的小潘恩」，蜀姨母說時俯首到他枕上，嘆了一聲，小橋本是睡眼昏花，至此瞿然而醒，心裏充滿了恐懼和驚異；他矇矓地覺到爲什麽蜀姨母叫他「喬恩」，並且爲他哭泣，彷彿天已降了什麽奇禍於他了。他只抓住營她，不說一字，不久她便鎭靜下來，看見他面色沮喪，便給他慈愛的一吻，並說道」：</p>
<p>「我們要去向他說再會了，我的寳，而且不可稍有躭誤；所以快快穿衣服，就到我的房</p>
<p>「是，我當照做」；蜀姨母去了以後，小橋靜靜起來，穿上衣服還不知是醒是夢，見韜摩還是酣睡着，也不去驚醒，只穿過了那寂靜的屋子，覺得一件憂愁而從未經歷過的什麽事快到臨了——這件事把他從孩子們中暫時劈了開來，使這世界看去是黑暗，孤寂，而且奇怪，正如那些房間到了夜裏一般。勞笠先生送來的一輛馬車停在門口。小梅一會兒也準備好了，兄妹二人，旁有姨母和姨丈護衛着，一路手牽着手，坐着車子，迅疾而嘿靜地穿過許多陰影的道路，直向鎮上去向父親永訣了。</p>

<p>— 何歸</p>
<p>小姐們，時間是很快的，不知不覺中你已離開了固有的家庭而成一另一家庭的主婦了，新的家庭果然是你理想中的天地，然而，在你做着新的主婦的初起，總覺得有許許多多的麻煩吧。你不知怎樣纔能維持和丈夫的永久歡愛，你又不知怎樣來管這個新創的家庭，一些些的細故都會使你傷心落淚，或許你從這些細故裏抱怨到結婚的麻煩和苦痛吧！</p>
<p>小姐們，你得知道，你的母親在初作主婦的時候，也是經過這樣的困難的，但是伊老人家終於把你們子女撫養成人；把你嫁去分擔了女性必然要作的主婦責任，伊是你最好的榜樣，你應當儘量學取伊的優點，自然伊所做的也許有不對的地方，凡是不對的地方，你可以把它當個教訓，在你的新家庭中改正過來的。</p>
<p>譬如你所顧慮的怎樣去維持夫婦間永久的歡愛吧！這也是不怎樣困難的。夫婦之間除了互相的容忍和互相諒解之外，最緊要的條伴就是明白你們的愛情不是建築在錢財上面的，你的父母有時偶然要失和吧？他們的失和的原因大多為幾個錢，世間上不知有多少快樂的配偶為了金錢的爭執而遭受不可挽救的困苦這些，都是你不應追踪的前車，你丈夫的收入很少，他不能使你穿得很體面，吃得很豐滿，當你看到同學和朋友中間有些人的物質高出於你，在你終覺得自己的寒酸而有失體面吧！在這裹你會責難你的丈夫無能，怪怨自己的命苦，甚至你會對你丈夫作出不忠實的行為來滿足你的物質慾望，也許，你的丈夫是富有錢財的，使你的物質享受非常豐滿，你處在這樣的環境裹，似乎是人間的天堂了，今天耍這樣，明天要那樣，不一而足，試問這與你又有什麼益處呢？所謂「行屍走肉」不就是指着那般人而言的嗎？</p>
<p>你想，歷史上的偉大女性是那些人物呢？是勤儉的呢還是奢華的呢？你是受過教育的，一定知道很多，楊玉環和慈禧太后死了好多年，，現代人不是還在駡着伊們嗎？梁鴻和孟光這一對夫妻，你也知道的，他們的生活很苦，然而後世人都稱他們賢。</p>
<p>這樣，你可明白了，無論你的丈夫是窮或富，你應當脫開「物質慾」這魔鬼，夫婦間的愛情纔可維持長久的。</p>
<p>上面的說話如果說中了你的弱點，那末希望你們快快改掉，幸福依然屬於你的，反之你就要遭遇很大的苦痛，在這一生中，你的新家庭無論在那一種情形之下，你們夫婦都要努力向前，不耍為了一時的安樂而停頓進取，你還應當時時鼓厲你的丈夫前進，那末你的愛情也是與日俱增的，你的新家庭裏一定充滿快樂的氣象。</p>

<p>——我國鄒儀新夫人——</p>
<p>在無一不落後的我國，各種科學，當然落於各國之後的。日本是新進的國家，不論任何事情，總是和歐美各國競爭着。獨有女流天文學家，尚未產生，不得不讓我國鄒儀新夫人專美於前，為我國新女性吐氣揚眉了。茲將日人對鄒女士的頌揚之詞，略述於下，以嚮讀者。</p>
<p>今年日本天文學界因為觀測日蝕的機會較多，於是迎接到着一位中國的珍客，伊是南京國立中央大學天文臺技師鄒儀新。在日本有天文學者志望的勇敢女性，還是一個也沒有，所以鄒夫人將為東洋唯一的女天文學者了。他是在中央大學受了教育，便在母校的天文臺為技師，時常有論文發表着。因為中國的天體觀察設備，並不完全，所以來日深造。經外務省文部省的斡旋，於今年三月中將在東京府下三鷹村的東京天文臺作客。中國留學生在日本學習天文學的也有五六人，但畢業於天文學科的僅沈徐兩君而已。沈君等已赴德國，有相當聲譽，這都是男性，而且是在日本學習的。現在鄒夫人是在本國學習了天文學而來實習的，當然更為珍貴。東洋女流天文學家，鄒夫人是第一人了。</p>

<h3 id="c200">邰爽秋夫人黃季馬女士談家政敎育 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>家政敎育，是多麼重要的學科，尤其在現代新家庭制度盛行的時期。作者因為這意念的鼓勵，特地去訪問黃季馬女士，她不但是社會服務的先録，也是新時代的賢妻良母。邰博士以前在廣東河南各大學執敎，她也同去服務，后來他任大夏大學敎育學院院長，她也在大夏任講師；他創辦「敎育編譯館」，發起「廿二社運動」，發明「爽秋　及敎育車」，都得到她不少的助力。像這樣一個賢能的夫人，你道值不值得做一般婦婦的模笵？以下的話，是當時雞零狗碎的紀録：</p>
<p>研究醫學的動機</p>
<p>邰夫人說：「我和邰先生是國立東南大學的同學，班决比我高，我研究外國文學，他是讀教育學的；後來他去美國留學，我覺得外國語不切實用，便轉到北平協和醫大，以為進可以做醫生，退可以指導一般家庭的健康問題。可是我體質太弱，用不起苦功，仍回東大畢業。到了上海，忽然又想繼續學醫，恰巧西門初創女子醫科大學，我又研究了兩年，讀完規定的學分，對醫學已有了門徑，此時郃先生正回國，並不贊成我學醫的主張。意思是要我同為教育服務，其實學了專門技術，同樣可以貢獻於教育的，這是性之所好，不願違反了自己的志願。</p>
<p>家政教育的貢獻</p>
<p>我倆組織家庭之後，便實行預定的計劃，致力於教育事業，三年以前，我倆在河南大學，省立女師聘我担任家事學，我感覺西北女子很樸質耐勞，原來的家事科，只授烹飪縫紉等普通常識，當然還不夠的，我便决定把範圍擴大，自編講義，除了家庭的衣。食·住·以外，側重於　家庭健康—如身體的保護，健康檢查，傳染病的預防，普通病症的急救與看護，家庭醫藥的設備；　婦人生產—如產前產後的衛生，嬰兒的保養，嬰兒生活習慣的養成，疾病的處理；　家庭教育—如兒童心理，兒童的行為，智德體各方面的指導；　家庭經濟—如預算與决算，儲蓄與保險，家用簿記；　家庭應酬……，這些婦女必需的智識，分門別類的詳細解釋，學生都極戚與味。教了的莫年半的功夫，我問她們這些學理以前學過沒有？大家說沒有。我說諾位將來都要做主婦的，那末這種學識，都得實地應用出來。我想一個女子，若是不懂家政學，是不配做主婦的；更談不上建設新家庭，改造腐惡的社會，單說服務社會，也是很渺茫的。近年重返上海，我於處理家政之餘，復在大夏擔任家事科，把以前的購義，重行整理，出版了兩本書：一是「實用家事學」，一是「家事」，想把家政學灌輸給先覺的婦女。</p>
<p>婦女服務的我見</p>
<p>我以為現代婦女，只是在家做主婦，不能發揮自己的能力，做有利於大衆的社會事業，未免太狹隘，反之只為社會服務，而鄙棄了家政，也不是家庭的幸福。其實不應當把家庭服務和社會服務看得有顯然的區別，這兩方面，應該打成一片，因為社會服務，可說是間接替別人的家庭服務；而家庭服務，是直接為自己的家庭服務；所以我主張一個婦女要認定在家庭服務中，同時幹社會服務的事業。現今都市婦女，有的步門不出，有的整天游樂，而婦女問正當的聯絡，可說絕無僅有。我想組織一種俱樂部，每周集會一决，有正當的娛樂，並有公開演講，可以交換智識，研究本身利害相關的問題，無論那一種智識，一人明暸，其利有限，大衆知道，收效便宏；要使各個家庭愉快，少不得這種共同集會的。</p>
<p>邰氏的家庭</p>
<p>他們的家庭也很值得吾人模仿。邰先生差不多一天到晚在外服務，家常事務，都由夫人主持，他倆沒有煙酒賭博等不正當的嗜好，而寄情於書報著述體育之中。據說家用比普通中等家庭還要節省，別家嬰兒吃的是牛乳鷄汁滋補之品，而他倆的小孩，只飲豆乳與米湯，這是邰氏夫婦的主張，即此一點，可概其餘。允共邰先生勤儉刻苦的精神，等於鄉間的老農，他一身所穿的是土布，每件衣服，所費不過三四元，他這位儉的運動的領袖，的確能言能行，不比一般愛做領袖的人，滿口仁義道德，心地卻不堪聞問的。我在部家客堂裹；見有韓國鈞氏書贈的聯語：</p>
<p>胸中萬卷可支餓世上點塵不到門</p>
<p>我細細體味之後，覺得以這副聯來描寫邰氏夫婦的為人，倒是再恰當沒有的了。</p>

<h3 id="c202">一年來的日本女作家（日本通信） <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 曼之</p>
<p>一般的說來，日本女性在社會上的地位是很低的，但是伊們在文學上却有高度的表現，總合一年來在各雜誌上所發表的作品，無論在量的方面，或質的方面，都有可觀的成續。</p>
<p>一年來多少的表示了作品活動的女作家，照習慣的分派來說，可以大概分成兩大派，一派是布爾喬亞文學，一派是普羅列塔利亞文學。布爾文學的作者，有野上彌生子，宇野千代，林芙美子，岡田禎子，圓地文子，美川渠子，仲町禎子，富本陽子，矢田津世子等。普羅作家，則有中條百合子，平林太子，窪川稻子，平林英子，松田解子，大谷藤子，以及新作家淺井花子等。但是，同是布爾作家，如像野上彌生子的「可憐的少年」那樣的作品，又不能與宇野千代，林芙美了們的作品歸屬一類的。「可憐的少年」那樣作品，充滿着積極的自由主義思想，對於現代日本的社會表示着非常的反抗。岡田禎子，圓地文子，富地陽子等的作品，也強烈地帶着這種色彩，這是在布爾的男作家的作品裹難得見到的事，日本女作家的自由主義，可以說比男作家更保存着純粹性。</p>
<p>野上彌生子在「可憐的少年」之外，還寫了「小鬼之歌」，是取村於法政大學的騷動，把自己的丈夫作中心人物之一的小說，有許多的非難都說伊對於身邊人物的觀察不嚴密。「可憐的少年」描寫一個少年的心被軍事教練所傷害。是啟蒙主義的作品。</p>
<p>宇野千代所寫的「色情」，「我與小孩」，「別離的愉快」，「女性的生活」，「娼妓的信」等，大部分是描寫色情世界的。</p>
<p>林美美子寫了「下霧的日子」，「克拉拉」，「人生賦」，「牡雞」，「葡萄之岸」，「牡蠣」等，在「牡蠣」和「下霧的日子裹，可以看出作者努力於從抒情主義轉變到觀察文學去的痕跡，特別是「牡蠣」獲得了文壇的好評。</p>
<p>罔田禎子寫了戲曲「密司徐徐愛茜」是將某女士準備許配給阿比西尼亞皇帝為皇刀的問題，諧謔她戲曲化的作品。圓地文子也發表了戲曲，如「偽造事件」等。</p>
<p>在普羅派中，首推中條百合子，這一年來，伊寫了「乳房」和「突堤」，後來就陷進不能執筆的境遇中去了。「突堤」也是伊在囚犯生活中寫成的。「乳房」在許多的批評上是非常好的。芹澤光治良氏說它是一個將日常性與歷史性張合起來的好作品。</p>
<p>平林泰子，是普羅派當中一年來最多產的作家，寫了「櫻」，「知識階級論的一個素材」，「章魚」，「土曜日之夜」，「女的問題」等。「櫻」是一個諷刺作品，「知識階級論的一個素材」是因為這一年來的日本論壇上關於知識階級的議論紛紛，而批判地描寫知識階級的一個典型的作品。「章魚」則是描寫勞働階級中的吾定人物的作品。特別值得我們注意的是「女的問題」，這是對於婦女經濟獨立，男女平等為口頭禪的自由主義的男女觀，從女子的立場提出疑問的作品。總觀起來，一年來伊所寫的作品都是以社會的批評為主的。</p>
<p>窪川稻子寫了「一袋粗點心」，「鐵屑之中」，「沿途」等。「一袋粗點心」，因為充滿着女性心理的而受到讚賞。「沿途」是一個女工對於伊少女時代的回憶。松田解子則在「婦人文藝」上連載了長篇「鄉下人」。</p>
<p>平林英子所寫的「一個典型」，「日常事」，都是以自己身邊的事情為題材的。藤島卷在「文學評論上發表了長篇「污辱之中」。新進作家淺井花子也寫了「泥濘之春」。大谷藤子發表了「須崎屋」，「母親的信」，一血緣」等。此外，新作家及其作品，有內山生子的「助手」，戶川靜子的死生。</p>
<p>從以上的敘述中就可以看出日本女作家的活躍。但同頭來看我們中國，一年來女性在文學上的活動，完全趨於衰落的狀態，不但沒有新的女作家出現，就是既成的女作家，也沒有發家與從事於文學的女性們，在這樣的狀態之下，我們應該怎樣努力在文學上表現女性的創造力！</p>
<h3 id="c203">關於婦女問題的兩大營壘 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 柳亞子</p>
<p>關於婦女問題，近來是分成為兩大營壘的了。一方面，說男性是人類，女性也是人類，所以男女應該不分性別，以人類的資格為全人類而努力。另一方面，卻要呌婦女還到廚房里面去，家庭里面去，做做蛋糕布丁，抱抱小孩，就算盡了她們的天職，而美其名曰賢母良妻論，或者是新賢母良妻論了。這二者中間，我是贊成前一個主張的。賢母良妻當然好聽，誰會主張婦女應該做不賢良的母妻呢？不過，照同樣的比例來講，男子應該做賢父良夫，總也是無所逃於天地之間的大義吧。但是，為什麼不要提倡賢父良夫呢？可是男性對於父夫之外，還有他應盡之責任；那末，難道女性對於母妻之外，就沒有她應盡的責任嗎？我的主張，將來大同世界，自由戀愛，兒童公育，連父母妻子的名義都沒有了，當然更無所謂賢良。在現在呢，父夫的義務是應該和母妻對立的。既然沒有聽見人家在提倡賢父良夫，那末提倡賢母良妻總也是多餘的了。</p>
<p>「婦女生活」的論調，它是屬於前者的。它能脫盡窠臼的賢母良妻諭，主張婦女應該為全民族而努力，更應該為全人類而努力。這主張，我是以為值得擁護，值得介紹的吧。</p>
<p>編者按：本刊對於婦女問題，並無成見，無論入社會也好，進廚房也好；關於這兩派論調的文字，我們是一律歡迎的。</p>

<h3 id="c218">解放婢女運動 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 劍平</p>
<p>本報五日列載：本埠公安局以「解放孤苦伶仃之無家女子，與國際信譽及人道法律，均極有關係，」所以便决定了在三月開始時便實行開始登記，「無條伴釋放」婢女，使之「恢復自由。」對於這一個消息，可算是值得高與的。雖然在原則上，只是淺狹地為了「國際信譽，」為了「人道法律，」而不在乎於該「孤苦伶仃的女子」的被虐待，而謀出路，但是為了他們的辦法的斷然處置，也是該值得威謝的一件功德。</p>
<p>現在，要特別提出來討論的是「登記辦法」中第二·三·四·三項的關於婢女被解放後的出路問題。</p>
<p>在第二項的條文是：「如係未成年而無家可歸，或歸家而無力贍養者，應送本市救濟院或其他慈善團體安置之。「這和第四項的「已解放之婢女又無家屬或家屬所在地不明者，得選定當地救濟院或其他慈善團體主持人為其監護人。「差不多是同一的意思。這都是很明顯地「人道」地去對於婢女無條件地可憐，「監護。」這在原則上可以說是妥當的，不過我們可說是不澈底。因為一個人需要的眞正自由是有眞正的技能謀自立，而不是需要任何人來依賴。雖然，或者救濟院中是有辦法教導該婢女以技能的，但救濟院的出路又不外是「公開擇配，」這不又是，「不通」嗎。因此，我們希望對於「已解放的婢女，」需要一種嚴密的訓練機關來使她們自己學成一種技能；而又需要一種職業介紹所的機關來指導她們的職業途徑，那才是眞正的解放，那才是眞正的自由。至於第三項中，對於已成年者（滿十六歲）則「徵求其本人同意，代為擇配。」也是不明白如上面所說的「女人的出路不是結婚後依賴丈夫」的道理所致的錯誤。從這三點不澈底的辦法，使我想起了根本地便是他們的解放的理由不澈底。她們應該以「婢女的眞正出路，眞正自由一當成大前提，那才可以研討出那澈底的辦法來。</p>
<h3 id="c219">無題 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 陳跡</p>
<p>我很難安下個「題目」來，我很悲哀</p>
<p>一個「小學教師」在目下就是悲哀的象徵。我是個「小學教師」。</p>
<p>開學了。我的心是多難受呵！——最難受的是：自己也辯別不出自己究竟是快樂的呢？還是悲哀的呢？</p>
<p>我就懷着這樣的性情跑進了課堂。因為「課程表」尚未排定，所以我給小朋友們談些時事呀，或則是一些「為人之道」的道理。</p>
<p>我講得是那麼起勁。我看見每個小朋友的面部表情是跟著我的講話的緊張而緊張，寬弛而寬弛。然而使我驚奇的，卻是例外地一個新來的小朋友，他的面部什麼都沒有表情，只是兩道眉毛是那麼憂鬱地呆着在眼睛上，他既也不笑，也不憤慨；他的面孔是一池死水！</p>
<p>在我停下來不講的時候，我記起了：沒有多少天之前學校里正輸到我在校里值日，那時正是寒假，同事們是都出去了，只冷淸淸地把我一個人拋在校里。有一個老年人進來，他問我「報名還可以嗎？」「可以！」我回答。於是他塡下了「報名單」。</p>
<p>我問他：「那孩子是你的令郎？」</p>
<p>「不是！不是！」他急急地搖着頭：「是我的孫子！」</p>
<p>「是你的孫子？」我端相着他的臉兒。說是老年人，也决不會超出六十歲的。然而他是有了一個十三歲的孫子了。</p>
<p>他對於我那種懷疑，感到一種非常的不安。他咳嗽起來了，並且馬上拿出一塊手帕來，掩着嘴。我見到他的眼睛里條地浮出淚水來了。我驚奇了，「為什麼有淚哪？」他假裝去醒鼻涕，卻是給我瞥見，他是把淚水揩乾了。</p>
<p>他那麼輕微地，深恐被人知道那是嘆息，嘆了一口氣道：「先生！那孩子是在鄉下私塾里讀的，或者在上海程度有所夠不上，那要請你先生特別費心了！」</p>
<p>「那當然！那當然！」我看見他是用一種多懇切的眼光在瞧緊我呵！待了會兒，他說了：</p>
<p>「我把學費雜費……都繳了吧！」</p>
<p>他用手向衣袋甩把錢拿了出來。我開給他一張收條。他接了那張收條就忽忽地走了。我送到他門口。</p>
<p>「再會，先生！」口調是微顫的。</p>
<p>「再會！再會！」他的後影是跟隨着一堆悲哀的死灰。……</p>
<p>想到道里，我又很注意地望了望那個新來的小朋友的面孔。——是一池死水的面孔呵！</p>
<p>「是的！」很輕很輕。</p>
<p>「你的爸爸在哪兒做生意？」</p>
<p>他只是搖頭，我還認為他不懂我問語，因此我再問他一句，是說得很慢比較明晰的。</p>
<p>「你的爸爸在哪兒做生意？」</p>
<p>他一邊搖頭，一邊說：「沒有！沒有！」</p>
<p>「沒有做生意，失業着嗎？」</p>
<p>他顯然是很為難來回答我的樣子似地，然而卻又不得不回答我，他說：「不是，我的爸爸是死了！」</p>
<p>「死了？」</p>
<p>點一點頭。</p>
<p>「死了幾年了？」</p>
<p>「六年。」</p>
<p>「那麼你的媽媽呢？」</p>
<p>「也死了！」</p>
<p>他「哇」地哭了出來。我的心像受了錄利的劍子的一擊，其他小朋友有的看着他在發呆，有的卻用着訕笑的臉兒說</p>
<p>「咦！哭啦！哭啦！」</p>
<p>下課鐘饗了，我連看他一眼的勇氣都沒有，很快地逃進了「教員辦事室」。我是那麼後悔呵，我為什要去傷了這天眞的小心呵！</p>
<p>唉！沒有了兒子的悲哀，沒有了爸爸媽媽悲哀，呵！我的淚也流了下來。</p>
<h3 id="c220">夜 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 黑丁</p>
<p>王林已經病了十幾天了。自從九一八那天他被　　兵從兵工廠趕出來而失了業，他每天是在煩惱中度着他的寂寞的時日。他踏着絕望的路，在悲哀，在沉痛！他像被陷在黑暗圈里。他喘不上來一口舒服的氣。他和別人一樣，是失掉了生之保障。他不敢想，這一個憂鬱的國度，這一個廣大無比的罪惡的屠塲。他眞要担心，他的一家四口人會臨於死減的境界里。</p>
<p>他有一個老婆，兩個孩子。大孩子十四歲，呌小毛。小孩子還不夠三個月。他們的生活是糟到不能言說的地步，他被病纏繞着不能下炕，除了小毛和他母親每天背着大竹筐子，偷偷地跑到束郊人家的田地里，去捋些包米，高梁穗，黃豆角子，回來煮着全家吃個飽，那再就沒有別的門路可走了。</p>
<p>然而，不久是冬天了。那叢鬱鬱的繁茂的郊野已是一片枯黃的慘景了。從此，他們連吃包米，高梁穗黃豆角子的福分也沒有了。</p>
<p>他們是踏着一條飢餓的黑綫。</p>
<p>是在過年的前一天，小毛聽了母親的話，一早到皇姑屯他舅舅家里，手里還提着一隻米袋子，意思是要向舅舅借點米，回來好預備明天過年吃。那知他帶了一個失望跑回家：他說舅舅家里還只有幾盌米，述他自己明天都不夠用。小毛的母親聽了直唉聲嘆氣，她看了看小毛的父親小毛的父親這時有些茫然了。他閉着兩眼，在喉嚨里唔嚕了幾句什麼話，那最後的一句是：「唉…等死吧」</p>
<p>傍晚。天下着雪。西北風呼呼地直括。小毛沒有在家，從午後就出去了，一直到這時還沒見回家。小毛的母親和他父親都在疑心他是又到邊門里姓趙的那家公館去討剩飯吃去了。小的孩子不肯睡，老是哭。屋子里沒有點燈，四週已經有些發暗了。頂棚上的碎紙片嘩啦嘩啦地嚮個不停。小毛的母親抱着孩子，靠着牆壁。小毛的父親躺在小毛的母親的身邊，好像是害冷的樣子他把身子緊緊縮在一條小薄被子里。他們並沒有多談幾句話。他們還沒有吃飯。他們希望小毛回來能夠給他們帶回來那家公館吃剩下的飯，他們相信小毛是會這樣的。現在他們的生活也就是指望着小毛一個人：秋天小毛到郊野去捋包米，高梁穗黃豆角子，可是冬天小毛每天是要到人家門口去討剩飯帶回家。所以他們是很喜歡小毛的。</p>
<p>屋子是寂寞的，點綴在這寂寞的空氣里，那眞是一幅沒有渲染上些微的悅目的色彩的圖畫。</p>
<p>正在這時，從胡同頭上飛來一種驚人的聲音，那似乎是一個人的跑步動靜，又凌亂又急迫。他們頓時慌恐起來，都在猜疑外邊又鬧什麼亂子了！他們用耳朵好好的聽，但是聽不到人的呼喊，也聽不到在鬧亂子時所應有的槍聲。</p>
<p>那聲音一步一步的近了，一直的闖進了胡同內，及至那聲音挨近了他們的大門口，只聽大門啪的一聲給踢開了。接着一條黑的人影子跳進屋里，還沒等他們看淸楚是誰，那跳進來的人便撕破了喉嚨般的結結巴巴的呌喊：「爸，爸，爸……」</p>
<p>喘了喘氣，接着又「爸爸，快給我一條蔴袋……」</p>
<p>這呌喊原來是小毛。他這種樣子不知為了什麼，竟使他們都跟着害怕起來，於是每個人的臉上是有着一種緊張的血色。</p>
<p>小毛的父親，發着楞，從炕上爬起來，跳到地下，一把抓着小毛的手腕，顫抖抖的樣子，說：「你，你，哈事呀？」</p>
<p>小毛用一隻很髒的手掌，胡亂地在面額上抓了好幾把：他的手掌都被汗水沾滿了。他吐了一口吐沫，便裂開嘴皮：「這一回，我們要去…你們不知道呀，　　街恒興德糧米店被搶了！門口那麼一大堆人，都拿着米袋子。屋里爭吵起來。我要帶着蔴袋去，搶一點明天咱們好過年……」</p>
<p>不等小毛說完，小毛的父親幾乎瘋在一般的跳躍起來，他握着拳，恨恨的說；「走，我也去，不然我們也要餓死…」</p>
<p>小毛的母親，急忙用手上前掣着小毛的父親的大襟，用哀告的口吻這麼說；「小毛他爸，你有病，你去不得，你有病……」</p>
<p>但，他終於跑出了門去，小毛在後邊跟着。當他們出了胡同頭，小毛的母親惘惘地站在大門口的石堦上，提高嗓音，這麼呌：「小毛，你要好好照顧你爸爸呵，你們不要粗心，性命要緊呀………」</p>
<p>然而他們裝做沒有聽見似的，卻風一般的朝着　　街飛跑去了。到了　　街，到了恒興德門口，他們不顧命的往人堆里擠。小毛擠不動，其初是用手牢牢地擊着他父親的衣服，可是擎着，擊</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>着，小毛終於被人家擠開了，他看不到爸爸是被擠到那見去了。他仰着臉子看了半天最後他發現爸爸正抗着兩袋洋麵往外擠，但，這時門外忽然槍聲嚮了。於是，擁在門口那一大堆人，跑的跑，仆倒的仆倒，一陣卻呈現着一種悽慘的悲劇。就在這種狀態之下，小毛的爸爸把抗在肩頭上的兩袋洋麵一鬆手，便迅速地躺在地上。小毛一邊哭，一邊喊，而且兩手在地上爬。槍聲緊密了。半天，小毛卻靜靜地蜷伏在成流的血泊里。</p>
<p>夜籠罩着大地。從來邊門里的大街上飛來××軍守備隊的四輌載重兵車。</p>
<h3 id="c221">車皮兜攏了 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>—還鄉苦雪之四</p>
<p>這些日子，整個的心情，都埋在欣快里，教我們怎樣的去表白牠呢，心底，有一個刻劃不出的情緒呵！</p>
<p>天是拉下了愁悶的臉，哭了淚，輕飄的堆積在地面上。從那里帶來的一陣邪風呢？捲了堆積的淚，狂驟的撲擊着每個行人和建築物上，沙拉沙拉的，商店的招牌在吱吜吱吜的響了。</p>
<p>我們，踏着積厚的雪面在縱橫的鐵軌旁奔波着。估計，雪該在五寸以上吶！那笨重的油靴，劃碎了鏡子一樣的雪面。不經意的時候，腳踩上了坑坎的地方，牠就會躍進了鞋窩，那股涼氣由腳心直透到丹田，身上在打着寒噤。</p>
<p>——你會點車皮麼？小魏問我，手里拿了一包東西。</p>
<p>車皮？這是一個新名字，在我的耳朶里。</p>
<p>——不懂麼？他笑了，急驟的一個意念使他想到這名字和我生疏的緣故，於此，他招呼我，呌我和他做同樣的工作。</p>
<p>南頭，北頭，差不多都走遍了，可是，車皮的號頭，是難得兜攏的。小魏的皮帽子上的絲帶在風里飄蕩着，耳朶像被貓咬掉了的一樣，空曠的鐵道網里，行人們是絕跡了。</p>
<p>後來，小魏眞的急了，顧不了什慶風寒，把帽子摘下來，抓着頭髮，想着，那頭頂上冒着陣陣地蒸氣，額下，有一個不容易看見的肅嚴的面情。</p>
<p>——這樣吧，他决定了，把手里的一部份東西遞給我：你到那頭去找，我到旁處去，我們需要分工合做呵，頓了一下，他看着手上的錶：好，你快去，他們還等着我們回去吃飯呢！</p>
<p>沿了叉道，心里計算着，還少六節車皮，這，怎樣的能把牠找到呢？實在，我有點怕；我想，假使不能如願的使車子兜攏起來，說不定也許要受到什麼不滿意的責罰吧？惶恐，噙歷在喉嚨里</p>
<p>忽的，在後面有一種急促的腳聲，看一下，小魏慌張的跑過來說——</p>
<p>——忘了，忘了，一會我們都在車站柬的街口等着你，在那里聚齊！說過以後，他又頂着風雪急急地去了。</p>
<p>臘月，天本來就很短的，那面的街口，已經燃亮了點點的路燈，昏暗，迅速的掃下來，一切，都只存在了糢糊的輸廓了。</p>
<p>回去吧，找到了三節，共餘的也許在他們間發現了，我這樣的想。跟着不亮的街燈，向預約好了的街口走去！</p>
<p>——這麼晚才來，我們都等了許久了。阿劉笑着：走，　　樓先去喂一下肚子再說。他拉着我，往街口里拐進去。</p>
<p>在旅館里，我們不願意睡，計劃着僅有的一個明天，誰去購置什麼，誰去把首車怎樣的裝設一下，還有路上的吃食，以及什麼飲料之類……</p>
<p>——明天要早點起呀，睡吧。</p>
<p>——告訴茶房，炭火不要讓牠滅呀</p>
<p>躺在被窩里，心是不會平靜的。火，支撐着房間里的溫和，窗上，仍舊沙拉沙拉的彈着弦琴的獨奏！</p>

<p>— （葉西園）</p>
<p>在千粟參觀了這幾家醬油公司以後，我們深威覺到即使就是醬油事業，其經營也必須是大規模的。日本的醬油公同至少有資本金一二百萬乃至二三千萬的，因為大量生產，及合理化的結果，其生產費用自必減低，其市塲自必擴大。我們當初去的時侯，雖也不無雄心，以視我國經濟的落後，如何能望共項背；更何況國人祇知從事於投機，而不知努力於民族經濟生產事業之發展乎？自後回來了之後，又因中日間關係的。未能平靜，更不能將我們的理想實現一轉瞬又是四五年了。現在當我握筆為此文時，雖束北已非吾國，然國人似應有所覺悟：他日吾尚望從前我們的理想，能有實現之一日，則吾不虛此文矣。</p>
<p>臨了，我得感謝野田醬油會社的並木重太郎氏，茂木佐平治氏，也　廿醬油會社的米澤靖氏，及跳子醬油會社的篠木茂氏及濱口麟藏氏。這是因為他們的招待領導，才始我們不虛此千葉之行。時問雖已隔了幾年，我願他們的事業日進，健康日進。（完）</p>

<p>「湖山的悲劇」</p>
<p>某翁女名白薇又稱素蘋，幼年隨父遠學北平，愛慕留法寒會面　楊夢梅，兩相鐘情如漆，誓結秦晋之好。</p>
<p>孰知天不由人，環境交逼，某翁以父兄之權威，將女誤配其友家，白薇誓死不從，被父禁閉於西湖畔上，女便輕生自盡，幸而遇救未遂，白薇隱名立志，成為空前活尸，父見絕筆，後悔莫及，愛女成仇，不勝悲切，命僕另闢室，為女安靈之所，日供三餐以祭，夜為床舖疊被，并立愛女墓於湖畔，以效尚饗之吊。</p>
<p>日更月易，瞬經三載，楊生携弟遊杭，夜適投宿靜室，夢梅挑燈修文，隱聞怨女啜泣，楊生好奇所致，於是尋聲而去。</p>
<p>夢梅旣出而白薇入矣，偶見楊弟高臥，女大驚，縱身欲退，瞥見案頭文稿，持而誦之，或哀或喜，驟然悲從衷來，因讀楊生之淚史也，繼而探聽楊弟，始知夢梅遭逼，雖婚而以白薇為念，女暗忖素志妄廢，便使計脫身。</p>
<p>夢梅歸，弟告之，於是兄弟四出找尋，及聞槍聲始得，楊生大悅，孰知女頃即斃命，鳴呼蒼天不佑，僅晤最後一面，夢梅刺激過甚，疾發咯血而亡，嗟夫湖上悲劇，頑固之罪也。</p>

<p>Silkworm Seed Production Regulations Also Passed; Reconstruction Bonds to be Discussed Next Week</p>
<p>Nanjing - The Legislative Yuan held its 46th meeting on the morning of the 7th. Sixty-seven members, including Yao Chuanfa, attended. Under the chairmanship of Sun Ke and the secretary-general, Liang Hancao, the "Silkworm Seed Production Regulations" and the "Uniform Public Bonds Act of the 25th Year of the Republic" and the amortization schedule, two important bills, were passed. The "Reconstruction Public Bonds Act of the 25th Year of the Republic" and the amortization schedule were temporarily requested by Finance Minister Kong to be postponed to next week for further discussion because the principles and content of the bonds issuance still needed deliberation. Therefore, it was not reviewed. (Central News Agency Dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<p>Nanjing - The "Silkworm Seed Production Regulations" passed by the Legislative Yuan on the 7th were the result of seeking opinions from various parties during the review process. The content is extremely detailed and is expected to greatly benefit the future improvement of the silk industry in China. The text consists of thirty-five articles, which severely restrict the qualifications of silkworm seed manufacturers and technicians. It also stipulates that silkworm seed manufacturers are limited to using original silkworm seeds. Any silkworm seeds that fail inspection must be burned. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce can restrict the import of foreign silkworm seeds by order. (Central News Agency Dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Heated Debate Occurred During Discussion <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing - Heated debates occurred among the members when the Legislative Yuan reviewed the Uniform Public Bonds Act on the 7th. The atmosphere in the meeting was extremely tense. However, the bill was eventually passed smoothly. President Sun announced that the Reconstruction Public Bonds Act was postponed for review until next week at the request of Finance Minister Kong because the content still needed deliberation. Then, Ma Yinchu reported on the process of reviewing the Uniform Public Bonds Act. Ma said that the national budget for the fourth year of the Gansu period was originally expected to have a shortfall of about 200 million yuan. Now, only half of the year has passed, and the shortfall has already reached a huge 150 million yuan. In order to balance the national treasury revenue and expenditure, efforts should be made to make up for the deficit as soon as possible. There are two ways to make up for the deficit: one is to increase taxes, and the other is to borrow money. However, the current tax rates cannot be increased due to various reasons. The only option is to borrow money. The terms of foreign debt are too harsh, which is not what we want to borrow. Due to the shortfall in customs duties, the old debt fund for domestic debt is still a problem, and new debt cannot be raised. Forced by circumstances, the uniform public bonds are issued to extend the repayment period of the old debt, free up financial resources, and issue new debt. At the same time, two benefits can be obtained by issuing uniform public bonds. In the past, many bonds did not match their names in reality, and the fund was still allocated from customs duties. The names were actually uniform tax, salt tax, and treasury bills. Replacing them with uniform public bonds can unify the names. In the past, the nature of public bonds and treasury bills was not distinguished. Replacing them with uniform public bonds can determine the boundaries of bonds. As for the extension standards, those that can be repaid within three years are classified as Class A, five years as Class B, seven years as Class C, nine years as Class D, and twelve years as Class E. This method is only fair in comparison. In addition, the public bonds were not issued at the legal price. According to Xu Kan's reply, the public bonds can only be sold through subscription. After the speech, the members stood up to speak one after another, some advocating that the interest on uniform public bonds should also be reduced, and some advocating that since public bonds cannot be issued at 98% of the legal price, it is better to increase the interest and issue them at the legal price. Some even advocated postponing the discussion of the bill. Finally, President Sun spoke, informing the reasons for the different interest rates set by the Central Political Council for the uniform and reconstruction public bonds, and stated that the failure to issue public bonds at the legal price was entirely due to the illegal actions of the issuing agency, resulting in losses to the national treasury. He finally informed that the bill could not be postponed for discussion because the stock exchange had suspended trading due to the failure to issue uniform public bonds. If it is further delayed, there is a fear that bondholders will have misunderstandings about the government's debt default. After President Sun's explanation, the bill was passed smoothly.

<p>Tianjin - Although there is hope for a moderation in the Hebei-Chahar affairs, the prospect of opening up is very small.

<h3 id="e14">The Trend of Japan's Diplomacy towards China <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Recently, there are three things about Japan's diplomacy towards China that are most worthy of our attention. One is Arita Hachiro's mission to China, the second is that Isoya, the Japanese military attaché in China, was ordered to return to the military headquarters to make an important report and contribute his specific opinions on China's policies after meeting with President Chiang and Foreign Minister Zhang, and the third is that the three ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy are about to convene a joint meeting on China, while the relations between the army and navy stationed in China are being adjusted. Regarding the first point, Arita belongs to the powerful faction of Shigemitsu and has traveled to China for many years, advocating a "strong argument against China" and echoing the military headquarters. This mission to China is actually a substantial expression of Shigemitsu's faction holding full power over China's diplomacy. Regarding the second point, Isoya has the characteristics of the young and strong faction of the military headquarters. This trip is quite sufficient to affect the basic attitude of Japan's entire China policy. Regarding the third point, it can be seen that Japan intends to establish a line of internal compromise to build a diplomatic policy that is consistent in the attitude of the navy, army, and industrial capitalists, in order to sweep away the previous dichotomy of gradualism and radicalism and the opposition between Nanjing-centrism and North China-centrism.</p>
<p>Since Japan's diplomacy towards China has a clear new trend, the military headquarters and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan are also doubly busy in their consultation on China policies. Minister of the Army Kawashima has been consulting with the heads of the General Staff Headquarters on China's strategy and methods of dealing with the Manchurian-Mongolian dispute, and at the same time summoned the chief of staff Sakai and staff officer Ikeda of the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin, who had returned to China to listen to the report on the current situation in North China and to study in detail the attitude of the Japanese garrison in North China, the economic cooperation between China, Japan, and Manchuria, the negotiations on the anti-communist agreement, and the strengthening of the garrison in North China. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also convened a meeting to determine its policy towards China as "implementing a China-centered policy based on pan-Asianism." Japanese military attaché Isoya visited Shigemitsu on the 6th at the behest of the military headquarters to exchange views on the Chinese situation. As for North China, Commander Tada is discussing with Commander Wada of Lushun Port the issue of expanding the ports of North China, in order to ensure that the navy and army have regular contact in North China. All of these events are sufficient to serve as side evidence for the above three points of view.</p>
<p>How will the development of this situation affect the future of Sino-Japanese diplomacy? Although it is difficult for us to speculate at present, the remarks made by military attaché Isoya in Tokyo actually advocated that the Sino-Japanese Nanjing Conference should not include the discussion of any issues in North China. If this statement is indeed adopted by the Japanese diplomatic authorities, the future of Sino-Japanese relations will still be difficult to be overly optimistic, which is well known to people in both countries.</p>
<p>Now that Ambassador Arima has departed for home and the joint conference of the three ministries of the navy, army, and foreign affairs, centered on Arita, the ambassador to China, is about to be convened, Japan's policy towards China has entered the second stage, as reported in Tokyo. We sincerely hope that the Japanese authorities can base their decisions on the substantial maintenance of East Asian peace and on the absolute respect for the independence and sovereignty of the Chinese nation, so as to create a basis for possible emotional closeness between China and Japan. If Japan's foreign policy towards China still relies on the military headquarters everywhere, the future result will not be beneficial to the Chinese and Japanese nations.</p>

<p>Nanjing - Luo Wengan came to Nanjing to negotiate the funding for opening Huangpu Port. He has already met with the relevant authorities and is scheduled to discuss the matter with President Jiang within a few days. According to Luo, opening Huangpu Port is part of the Premier's nation-building strategy to construct a major southern port. Guangzhou occupies a crucial position in South China's commerce, but its port is too shallow, preventing large ships from entering. Since the opening of Hong Kong, the commercial center of South China has shifted there. Now that transportation in the inland areas of Guangdong and Guangxi is gradually being developed, and the Yuehan Railway will soon be completed, the construction of a major southern port cannot be delayed any longer. The port development plan has been repeatedly decided upon since 1925. However, in my opinion, we must first dredge the deep-sea harbor to allow large ships to enter at any time, so that the commercial port can prosper. Therefore, I have drawn up a construction program divided into four phases, each lasting six months. The first two phases will focus on surveying waterways and building small wharves connecting to the Yuehan Railway. The third and fourth phases will involve dredging and constructing wharves, warehouses, and other facilities. The construction costs are estimated at over four million one hundred thousand yuan. We plan to seek subsidies from the Ministry of Finance and Railways, and also consider using the port development site as a guarantee fund. After the project starts and credit is restored, we will issue public bonds. Negotiations are currently underway. The central government attaches great importance to the port development plan and should be able to achieve a result that allows the major southern port to be completed on schedule. Luo also mentioned that the Yuehan Railway is about to be completed, and Railway Director Zhang Jia'ao is scheduled to inspect the project in a week. I plan to go to Shanghai next week to inspect the Ruipu project and then come to Beijing to travel with Zhang to inspect the project, so as to learn from it, and then return to Guangdong via that route.

<p>Troops Concentrated on Both Sides of the Manchurian-Mongolian Border - War Imminent, People in a State of Panic</p>
<p>Dalian - Today, Dalian received various alarming news, giving passersby the impression that war on the Manchurian-Mongolian border is about to break out. Even calm observers believe that the situation is extremely serious. However, the local newspapers' disclosure of this news has created panic among the people. One report said that many military concentration points throughout the territory have been preparing to launch, and are quite busy. Another report said that Japanese and "Manchukuo" troops are departing for Outer Mongolia to cope with the active military preparations of Russian and Mongolian troops along the entire border. It is said that semi-official sources here also said that the situation is tense, and Japan and "Manchukuo" cannot turn a blind eye. Russian and Mongolian troops have gathered in large numbers, preparing to attack "Manchukuo." In addition, there have been reports of Outer Mongolia invading "Manchukuo" on both land and in the air. It is said that the Japanese and "Manchukuo" troops will drive out the Outer Mongolian troops who have occupied two places in western "Manchukuo." At the same time, the Kwantung Army Command stated that damaged Russian aircraft had been found in "Manchukuo" territory near the Outer Mongolian border. The Russian authorities have never announced this loss, which is quite strange. Five people have been arrested in Hailar, suspected of being Soviet Russian spies. (Reuters dispatch on the 7th)</p>

<p>Tokyo - A report received here today stated that an incident occurred on the "Manchukuo"-Mongolian border. About 20 Outer Mongolian soldiers attacked a "Manchukuo" border post near Beierdi on February 5, but were driven back by "Manchukuo" troops. It is said that Japan has not taken any new actions regarding the "Manchukuo"-Mongolian border conflicts. A Foreign Ministry spokesperson said today in response to questions from reporters that he does not know the exact relationship between Outer Mongolia and Soviet Russia because the Russian government has not yet responded to Japan's inquiry on this matter. As for the recent border conflicts, "Manchukuo" has protested severely to Russia, but the Russian government has protested to the Japanese government. Foreign Minister Hirota has told the Russian government that border incidents are a matter between "Manchukuo" and Russia and have no direct relationship with Japan. (Reuters dispatch on the 7th)</p>

<h3 id="e47">Japanese Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministries Decide on Diplomatic Policy <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Based on the Monroe Doctrine of East Asia - Improving Sino-Japanese Relations and Joint Anti-Communism</p>
<p>Tokyo - The fundamental policy of Japanese diplomacy after withdrawing from the arms reduction conference has been clearly expressed in Foreign Minister Hirota's speech on diplomatic policy at the 68th Diet session. In order to adjust the details and specific plans for implementation, the three ministries of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs have been holding liaison meetings for days, and the deliberations have been extremely cautious. It is confirmed that the main proposals on which the three ministries have reached complete agreement are as follows:</p>
<p>The era of the Navy becoming unconditional is not something that can be obtained by seeking it. Therefore, Japan should try its best to avoid causing the predictable free competition in shipbuilding in the absence of treaties.</p>
<p>The relationship between China and Japan depends on China's recognition of the existence of "Manchukuo." Improvement can be gradually achieved. Sino-Japanese cooperation and joint defense against communism are indispensable requirements for Japan to implement its East Asian policy. It is always necessary to move towards the path of realization as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Japan believes that the true intentions of the naval issue and the China issue can be gradually understood by various countries. It promises the United Kingdom and the United States to request freedom of commerce in order to remove the causes that threaten peace.</p>
<p>The Far East Red Army is a constant threat to "Manchukuo." The Soviet Union's communist activities are a fundamental obstacle to Japan's East Asian policy. Therefore, the demarcation of the Manchurian-Soviet border, the withdrawal of the Far East Red Army, and the completion of the joint defense against communism by Japan and China will prevent the occurrence of unfortunate events between Japan and the Soviet Union. This is what we firmly believe. The above-mentioned Japanese foreign policy is based on the principle of non-threat and non-aggression. It is due to the natural expansion of the leaping Japan, which spreads it to the four seas by peaceful means. Therefore, no country in the world is allowed to carry out illegal advances. East Asia is considered to be East Asia for East Asians, and it is gradually used to establish permanent world peace. (Allied News Agency dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Yesterday, in order to deal with the Manchurian-Soviet and Manchurian-Mongolian border disputes and to determine the policy toward the Soviet Union, a three-ministry council of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs was held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 6th. As a result of the discussion, quite strong opinions were present. As for the incidents of clashes between Japanese and Soviet soldiers, the Foreign Affairs authorities will judge the right and wrong after the situation becomes clear, or protest to the Soviet government or call attention to it next week. These opinions have been agreed upon and are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Japanese government, based on the policy of good neighborliness, non-threat, and non-aggression, strives to maintain peaceful and friendly relations with the Soviet Union and seeks to promote goodwill.</p>
<p>Based on the above principles, it is believed that the fundamental solution to border disputes is to first demarcate the unclear border. If the Soviet government hopes to seek means and methods to deal with disputes, then it is harmless for both parties to begin consultations.</p>
<p>As for the instability on the border, it is caused by the Soviet Union's expansion of unnecessary and huge military equipment. It goes without saying that the Soviet Union should be urged to reflect on this.</p>
<p>The above points are the adjustments to the attitude toward relations with the Soviet Union that have been established. Although the words and actions of the Soviet Union are stimulating, their hearts are extremely afraid of Japan's counterattack. Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev proposed to Japan on August 17 last year to establish a border dispute handling committee, and he has repeatedly raised it whenever there is an opportunity. This shows that the director of the European and Asian Affairs Bureau, Togo, reported the progress to Chongguang after the council, and studied the specific countermeasure for the negotiation with the Soviet Union. In the end, regarding the conflict incidents, Ambassador Ota will protest to the Soviet government and explain Japan's policy for eradicating disputes and ask it to reflect on it. The second step in adjusting the border dispute issue will be to continue the negotiations that were suspended last year in Tokyo by Foreign Minister Hirota and Ambassador Yurenev.

<p>London - The British Parliament focused on diplomatic issues on the 6th. Among the questions about the recent situation in the Far East, the current situation in "Manchukuo" and the interests of the United Kingdom, one member of parliament asked what countermeasures the government would take regarding the losses suffered by British merchants as a result of the "Manchukuo" monopoly of petroleum. The answer from the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Flandrin, was as follows:</p>
<p>The British rights and interests have suffered losses due to the "Manchukuo" determination of the petroleum monopoly system. Regarding the issue of compensation, negotiations are currently being conducted between the merchants concerned and the "Manchukuo" government. However, no agreement has been reached on the amount of compensation and other specific matters. The government hopes that the agreement will be established as soon as possible and is willing to fully exert its mediation efforts. (Allied News Agency dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<p>Washington - Senior officials believe that the Wilcox Bill, which advocates building strong military aviation bases in important locations on the US border and overseas territories, has failed. According to the report prepared by the Special Military Committee, it was submitted to Secretary of War Dern today. Because it belongs to national defense secrets, it will never be published. This report, in addition to being used as a reference for future national defense arrangements, is unlikely to be used for other purposes. Observers believe that building air force bases will exceed the scope of current national defense needs. Senior military officers also believe that it is unlikely that these very costly bases will be built domestically, but there may be a need for them at sea. In short, the general public believes that it is better to build aircraft than to build aircraft bases with useful money. (National Telegram dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<p>Washington - The Senate Munitions Investigating Committee learned today that if eight navy shipyards are to be renovated so that the government can build all of its own battleships, it will require an expenditure of 23 million yuan. This amount was submitted by the State Commercial Federation at the request of the Senate Committee. The committee also estimated that the government builds 17 battleships annually, costing 150 million yuan. By this analogy, twenty years later, it can build 20 battleships, 20 aircraft carriers, 20 heavy cruisers, 20 light cruisers, 200 destroyers, and 45 submarines. As for the cost of the government manufacturing all military equipment, if it wants to double the output of Colt Company's machine guns and small guns, it will cost 8 million yuan. Doubling the output of Brewerd Company's aircraft will cost 11 million yuan. Doubling the output of DuPont Company's military supplies will cost 3 million yuan.

<p>Washington - Mr. Sirovich, a Democratic representative from New York, stated before the House Merchant Marine Committee today that many Japanese ships cruise off the coast of Alaska, ostensibly fishing, but actually engaging in military operations. These Japanese ships are measuring water depths, taking photographs of the coastline terrain, and checking where aircraft can land and where submarines can be based. Japan's purpose is to seize Alaska once war breaks out in order to obtain a food source for its people, because the Japanese live on fish. (Reuters dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - When the House Merchant Marine Committee of the United States gathered, Sirovich claimed that Japanese people in Alaska outwardly engaged in fishing, but in reality had military purposes, measuring water depth, taking photographs of the coastline terrain, and looking for locations for future airfields and submarine bases, in order to seize Alaska in the event of war, etc. Spokespersons for the Japanese Foreign Ministry and Navy Ministry today rejected this statement as too absurd and not worth criticizing.

<p>London: Admiral Raineri, the Italian representative at the Naval Conference, today visited Lieutenant General Robert, the French representative, to discuss the issue of main battleship tonnage and the future prospects of the Naval Conference. According to our correspondent, France and Italy hold completely identical views on the main battleship tonnage issue, advocating a maximum limit of 27,000 or 28,000 tons. At present, the main battleship tonnage issue remains a major obstacle to the establishment of a four-nation agreement. It is still unknown whether the expert subcommittee will raise this issue for discussion at its meeting tomorrow morning at Clarence House, as the subcommittee will first review the report submitted by the members of the committee responsible for studying the definition of warships. This committee continued its work this afternoon and has already decided on the following measures: Adopting the American proposal to increase the age of main battleships from twenty years to twenty-six years; Setting the age of cruisers at twenty years; Setting the age of destroyers at sixteen years; Setting the age of submarines at thirteen years; Any warship with a tonnage of 10,000 tons or more and a cannon caliber of eight inches or more shall be considered a main battleship; The definition of displacement shall still adopt the definition contained in the Washington Naval Treaty, that is, the displacement after the completion of construction, complete equipment, and complete navigation equipment; Small warships, such as shallow water coastal defense ships, are originally not subject to qualitative restrictions, and their construction does not need to be notified to each other. In the future, although they are still not subject to qualitative restrictions, they should be included in the annual warship construction program and notified to each other.

<h3 id="e58">Soviet Russia and Romania Negotiate a Military Treaty: Nature Similar to French-Russian and Russian-Czech Mutual Assistance Treaties; Negotiations Proceed Smoothly <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>London: The Soviet Union and Romania are currently negotiating a military treaty (as reported in yesterday's telegram, which is about to be signed). According to people from the Little Entente, the content of this treaty is roughly the same as the French-Russian and Russian-Czech mutual assistance treaties, and stipulates that if war breaks out between Hungary and Romania, the Soviet Union should automatically send troops to assist. One of the most difficult points in the negotiations between Russia and Romania is the issue of the passage of Russian troops, that is, if Czechoslovakia is invaded by Germany, the Soviet Union should send troops to assist according to the Russian-Czech mutual assistance treaty. At that time, Romania should allow the passage of Soviet land and air forces to help Czechoslovakia. The discussion of this issue took a lot of effort. Later, because the Russian treaty is based on Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, if Czechoslovakia is invaded by Germany, both Russia and Romania are member states of the League of Nations and have an obligation to assist Czechoslovakia. The passage of troops is naturally not a problem and does not need to be stipulated in the Russian treaty. Therefore, this difficulty was resolved. In addition, the issue of sovereignty over Bessarabia (which belonged to Russia before the war and is now owned by Romania) was definitively resolved during the London Economic Conference in 1933 when Russia, Poland, and eight other countries signed the definition of aggressor. Therefore, if Soviet troops pass through the province, it will not cause incidents. The current negotiations between Russia and Romania have a long history. They almost succeeded when Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu visited London in early July last year, but were suspended due to Yugoslavia's doubts about the Soviet Union's intentions. Now, Russia and Romania are on good terms, so the negotiations can proceed smoothly. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>London: According to financial circles here, progress has been made in the negotiations between France and Britain regarding a loan from Britain. Both parties agree that after the loan is completed, it will not be done by means of remittance (referring to the remittance of pounds to France), and the British Exchange Equalisation Account will also not formally and directly participate in the matter, so that it will not be necessary to request the approval of Parliament. Generally speaking, Britain will lend pounds to France, and France will exchange francs for pounds on the London market and then remit them to Paris. After these pounds are sold on the London market, the foreign exchange market will inevitably fall. At that time, the Equalisation Account will find ways to remedy it. According to financial circles, after the loan is completed, the Bank of France will not increase the issuance of banknotes. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>

Dr. Raffaelli worked in the ambulance unit three miles from Magale. He traveled by mule for fifteen days to reach here. He is the first white man to return here from the North Road front. Dr. Raffaelli described in detail the difficulties of the ambulance unit members' work and said that everyone was well, but they needed everything. They have not received mail in the past two days. There is currently no tobacco or salt, and working under high air pressure, they treat an average of 100 seriously wounded soldiers every day. He also said that Italian planes bomb the ambulance unit's tents with machine guns and bombs almost every day. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: Our special correspondent, Ochsner, reports that a certain European gentleman who had previously left with the army and stayed in the first line of defense of Magaleh on the North Road for many days is familiar with the situation at the front. According to his observations, the Abyssinian army clearly has the upper hand on the Tigray Province front on the North Road, and its morale is higher than that of the Italian army. However, at present, the Abyssinian army does not want to extend the lines of communication, which is unfavorable. Therefore, it is determined to hold the existing lines of defense and not advance further, but only adopt guerrilla tactics to wear down the enemy. They often sneak through the barbed wire at night and launch attacks on small Italian army camps. During the day, they only launch surprise attacks on Italian army supply convoys and outposts. As a result, the Italian army is in great distress and has suffered considerable losses. The positions abandoned by the Italian army are occupied by the Abyssinian army. The European gentleman believes that the Abyssinian army will soon be able to recapture Magaleh by adopting this tactic. Once Magaleh falls, the Abyssinian army will seize the opportunity to advance and capture Adowa. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Geneva: The expert subcommittee considering the issue of oil substitutes has prepared a report stating that Italy will be unable to do anything without oil imports, and Italy does not have the necessary machinery to produce sufficient oil substitutes. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Geneva: The committee of experts on the issue of coal oil embargo, which belongs to the League of Nations' eighteen-nation subcommittee, had previously appointed members of the committee to specialize in the issue of coal oil substitutes.

It is said that any country that intends to use substitutes to replace coal oil can only reach a maximum ratio of 15% to 20% of the total consumption in peacetime, and it is impossible to exceed this. Therefore, if the coal oil embargo can be implemented, it will definitely have a practical effect and bring the current war to a swift end. Regarding the issue of transporting Italian coal oil and its by-products, the expert committee will meet tomorrow to study it. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Geneva: League of Nations personnel recently declared that the eighteen-nation subcommittee is unlikely to be convened between the end of this month and the beginning of next month, because it is not yet known what decision the US Congress will make on the new Neutrality Act. The eighteen-nation committee will naturally be at a loss as to what to do about the coal oil embargo. If the US Congress decides to maintain the status quo stipulated by the current Neutrality Act in accordance with the current opinions of the members, the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy will inevitably fail, and the United States will bear the responsibility. Advocates of sanctions say that the report to be submitted by the eighteen-nation committee's expert committee on the coal oil embargo states that if the amount of coal oil exported by the United States to Italy can be reduced to the normal export amount, the League of Nations' sanctions will have a practical effect. If the US exports of coal oil to Italy are reduced to pre-war levels, Italy's needs can only be met by 5%. It is heard that US President Roosevelt can theoretically include coal oil in the list of items necessary for war in accordance with the current Neutrality Act and order it to be prohibited from being transported to belligerent countries, but due to the obstruction of the current attitude of the US Congress, it is unlikely that a decision will be made.

<p>Geneva: The League of Nations' new headquarters, the Ariana Palace, has now been completed and is scheduled to move in on the 17th of this month. Six Swiss moving companies have contracted to handle the relocation. Since the League of Nations began operating in the old headquarters in 1920, fifteen years have passed, and there are many documents and archives stored there, so the relocation procedures will take a week to complete. However, the League of Nations' library, which contains 200,000 books, and a side building built for the Disarmament Conference in 1931, will be relocated in the spring. The old headquarters was previously put up for auction and has now been purchased by the Swiss government for 4 million Swiss francs.

<p>London: Lord Londonderry, the former British Secretary of State for Air, visited the Olympic Games winter sports program in Garmisch, Germany, and is now staying in Berlin for a few days. It is heard that he informally visited German leader Hitler and his disarmament special envoy Ribbentrop, both of whom reiterated Germany's demand for the restoration of its colonies to Londonderry. Ribbentrop also said that this move was necessary because it was related to equal rights and German honor. Ribbentrop also said that Germany's rearmament was a natural result of the Soviet Union's expansion of armaments and its policies, so all Western European countries should unite to deal with the dangers of communism. According to private sources, the UK and Germany do not intend to hold negotiations on the colonial issue through diplomatic channels, but will be discussed by Lord Mount Temple, chairman of the British-German Friendship Association, and Ribbentrop. Informed sources in the British capital claim that they are unaware of the informal talks that Lord Londonderry held in Germany, and that Lord Londonderry did not have any mission when he went to Germany, so the British government is not bound by these talks. However, according to British parliamentarians, this type of talk is of a semi-official nature, and if it goes smoothly, Germany will formally demand the colonial issue. In the past, before the UK made important proposals to Germany, important British figures and German politicians would hold semi-official talks. At the beginning of last year, Liberal Party Senator Lord Lothian went to Germany on behalf of former Prime Minister MacDonald to discuss the disarmament issue. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>The Qingdao Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to investigate the industrial hygiene, personnel management, worker welfare, and various facilities of factories in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, and to learn from their strengths and weaknesses, specially sent Chen Keyao, second section chief of the bureau, along with Wang Shouze, Guan Xibin, Zhou Zixi, Sun Enqing, Chen Zhihan, Xu Biao, Yao Junhe, and Li Shiku, managers and technicians from various factories in Qingdao, to form the Qingdao Municipal Industrial Safety and Hygiene Observation Group. They arrived in Wuxi from Beijing the day before yesterday and stayed at the New World Hotel. Group leader Wang Shouze visited County Magistrate Long and notified the factories. Yesterday, they visited the Shenxin Yarn Factory, Lixin Cloth Factory, Huaxin Silk Factory, and Craft Machine Factory. Today, they visited the Liyong Paper Factory. Tonight, they will go to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Changzhou Labor Union Inspects Factory Cloth</p>
<p>The Wuyi Industrial Union believes that there are numerous cloth factories in the county, and the cloth produced each year is sold in various provinces in huge quantities. Recently, a small number of cloth factories have been mixing inferior materials into their products, making them difficult to sell and affecting other operators. It has been decided to form a yarn and cloth inspection committee and formulate inspection methods. Shen Changsheng, Gao Wanpeng, and Wang Bingjun have been appointed as inspectors of the first team to handle this inspection. Wang and the others have been going to various factories for inspection for several days, designating 20 bolts of cloth from each factory. The cloth will be sent to the union on the 7th and jointly reviewed by all members at the regular meeting on the 9th to rectify the situation.</p>
<p>Nantong Water Police Organize Coastal Patrol Teams</p>
<p>The coastal areas under the jurisdiction of Nantong in northern Jiangsu are approaching the fishing season. The various teams of the Third District of the Jiangsu Water Police have been transferred to the coastal areas to protect fishing and prevent bandits. District Chief Zhu Aizhou has specially organized a maritime patrol team. In addition to the patrol boats allocated by the Civil Affairs Department, fishing boats have been purchased and converted from the Haizhou area for patrol purposes.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Agricultural Bank Holds Business Conference</p>
<p>In order to promote this year's business and implement rural relief work, the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank has scheduled its 11th Business Conference to be held on the 7th. The conference will last for three days. Those invited to attend are approximately 40 managers of county branches and heads of offices. In addition to the Deputy General Manager of the bank, Chairman Chen of the Provincial Government was specially invited to attend and deliver a speech. Representatives from the Supervisory Committee and the Construction Department were also invited to attend and deliver speeches. Many proposals have been received from various groups. Group meetings will be held in four groups starting on the 7th. The formal meeting will be held on the 8th, and group meetings will continue on the 9th. The meeting will close in the afternoon. On the 10th, Chairman Chen will deliver a speech, and a joint meeting will be held with the Jiangsu Bank.</p>
<p>Yangzhou Coins Hidden in the Stomach of Salty Chicken</p>
<p>Wang Heqi and his son Minggao Mingkun, who co-run the Lu Chen Hang in Sunqiao Township, Shaobo, Seventh District, hid 498 coins in three salty chickens on the 25th day of the winter month last year and used them on the Shao Cheng Fu Yun steamship to cross the river. They were discovered by the county government and handed over to the 22nd Battalion Headquarters of the Provincial Security Forces for strict interrogation. They were then sent to the court. The prosecutor's office has completed the investigation and prosecuted the criminal court for the crime of obstructing national currency. The sentence is scheduled to be announced on the 12th of this month. In addition to allowing each of the three Wang Heqi father and son to pay a written guarantee of 5,000 yuan, they were also stamped with a store guarantee to go out and await the verdict.</p>
<p>Sluice Workers' Petition Yields Slight Results</p>
<p>The report on the petition of the Twelve Sluice boatmen's representatives to Yangzhou has been published in the previous newspaper. Since there is still no responsible person from the transport merchants to contact them, there is still no result. On the 6th, Xue Youcai and six other representatives of the Twelve Sluice Yanpu Labor Union, Wan Lianchen and two other representatives of the Jinan Salt Manufacturing Seven Company Employees Union, went to the county government and personally met with Section Chief Tang, submitting a petition stating that if the matter is not resolved, the situation will become more serious. It is feared that it will be impossible to stop those who continue to come to Yangzhou to petition. It is not known to what extent it will evolve in the future. They requested that the government convene the merchants to study solutions, first transport the salt stored in the Gan Four fiscal year, already taxed but not processed, and the Seven Company stored salt in the sluice as soon as possible, and then report and pay the salt that should be transported by sail in the Gan Five fiscal year, in accordance with the original plan, in order to maintain the status quo and resolve disputes. Otherwise, the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of workers will be cut off, which will not only affect social stability but also violate humanitarianism. The county government has informed the salt merchants' association and the salt affairs office on both sides of the river to handle the matter quickly, and ordered the representatives of the labor union to earnestly prevent the petitioning workers from coming to Yangzhou, but promised to send representatives to the salt affairs agency to petition. If there is any gathering of people to create disturbances, the union will be held accountable.</p>
<p>Gaoyou Yangzhou-Qingjiang Road Temporarily Closed for Three Months</p>
<p>The long-distance bus on the Yangzhou-Qingjiang Road had a major accident on January 6 in Fengshen Temple in the county, overturning into the river. Various groups in the county telegraphed the provincial government, requesting the construction of another motor road. This has been reported in this newspaper many times. It is now learned that Director Shen Baixian of the Construction Department, in view of this unfortunate incident, has not only punished those responsible and consoled the families of the deceased, but has also ordered the highway management office to temporarily close the Yangzhou-Qingjiang section for three months. All vehicles must be transported to Zhenjiang for thorough repairs. Before resuming operations, each vehicle must be carefully inspected for damage before it can be driven. The entire road surface will not only be repaired section by section, but the road surface near Shaobo will also be widened to 160 meters. The dangerous section of the Seven Public Hall in the county was originally planned to be demolished, but due to the public's adherence to customs, it was not easy to implement. It has now been decided to build a wide motor road behind the Seven Public Hall. The construction project has been approved, and the funding has been determined to be 50,000 yuan. Construction began on February 1. The construction plan has been ordered to be submitted by County Magistrate Cao of this county for approval in order to ensure the safety of vehicles.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Subsidies to Improve Pingshui Green Tea</p>
<p>Shaoxing Pingshui green tea is a famous product of Zhejiang Province. In recent years, tea farmers have adhered to old methods and do not know how to improve, resulting in poor manufacturing, which has greatly affected sales in overseas markets, and the impact on the rural economy is particularly significant. The Construction Department has decided to request the National Economic Council to allocate 50,000 yuan to establish a tea industry center. Taking advantage of the tea technology discussion meeting to be held in Nanjing on the 22nd of this month, Zhang Tianyi, inspector and director of the agricultural affairs section, will be sent to participate and hope for subsidies.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Biological Survey and Research Undertakings That China Urgently Needs to Conduct <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Xiansu</p>
<p>A nation's resources are nothing more than two major categories: organic and inorganic. The inorganic part, such as hydropower, falls under the scope of engineering, while minerals fall under the scope of geology (although coal and petroleum are formed from organic matter, they are still considered minerals). The organic part falls under the scope of biology, including both plants and animals. The application of biology is related to all aspects of human life, including clothing, food, housing, transportation, birth, aging, illness, and death. In general, it can be divided into three categories: industry, agriculture, and medicine. Those related to industry include leather, fiber, paper, rayon, explosives, paints, and wood. Those related to agriculture include animal husbandry, fisheries, crops, horticulture, pest control, and brewing. Those related to medicine include herbal medicine, parasites, and all physiological and pathological research. Since the application of biology is so broad, it is necessary to make strong distinctions. Considering various European and American countries, research related to human health and medicine is mostly managed by health authorities; research directly related to agriculture is managed by agricultural authorities; fisheries are managed by fisheries authorities; and forestry, due to its larger scope, is managed by forestry authorities. As for insects, there are often national insect bureaus to manage them. In addition, there are many types of biological research that may not be directly applicable, but have close relationships with applications, which are often managed by specialized academic institutions, such as the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in England, the Bureau of Plant Industry and the Biological Survey of the United States Department of Agriculture, the National Museum, and the Institute of Applied Botany in Russia. The size of the undertaking and the importance of the powers are determined by the background of history and inheritance, without any fixed rules. However, in scientifically advanced countries, it is well known that the research of pure science may not seem to have a close relationship with applications at first glance, but very important application results are often discovered from pure scientific research, such as the discovery of plants that produce rubber substitutes in Soviet Russia, and the discovery of croton by the Zhejiang Entomological Bureau, which can be used as a very important insecticide. Usually, researchers of applied biological sciences, such as agricultural, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry experts, often do not have in-depth studies of fundamental sciences such as zoology and botany, so they often have to seek help from purely research-oriented zoologists and botanists. Seeing this, advanced European and American countries have spared no effort in promoting biological research. For example, the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in England, is the largest and best-performing scientific institution in England; the Institute of Applied Botany in Russia has an annual budget of millions of rubles; and the National Biological Survey of the United States is also very large in scale. The history of biological research in our country is very short. Although there are now six or seven research institutes, and the achievements are quite excellent, the funding is extremely tight. There are many types of research that could be carried out in specialized application institutions, such as agricultural research institutes, but with everything waiting to be done, and talent and funding insufficient, it is impossible to proceed in these institutions. It is up to the country to determine what kind of biological research is most urgent for China today, whether to establish a separate institution to manage it, or to fund existing biological research institutions to undertake this work, so that the benefits can be great and fast, which can be foreseen.</p>
<p>Regarding the biological surveys and research undertakings that need to be carried out urgently, there are the following items:</p>
<p>(1) Research on forests</p>
<p>There are three major reasons why forestry has been promoted in our country for a long time, but the effect has not been significant: First, those who study forestry have not studied the trees of China, so there is no way to investigate what kinds of trees our country produces, and the yield, distribution, and area of various trees. Second, since the varieties of trees cannot be distinguished, the physical and chemical properties of wood cannot be studied, and all research on wood utilization cannot be started. Third, without distinguishing tree species, it is of course impossible to study the afforestation needs of various trees. Therefore, all past afforestation undertakings have been like a blind man describing an elephant. To remedy this, the following tasks must be carried out:</p>
<p>(A) Survey of tree species and compilation of a national tree atlas</p>
<p>There are extremely many kinds of trees in China. There are only more than 600 kinds of trees in North America, while in China, there are already 2,000 known kinds of trees, and new species are discovered every year. In the past four years, as many as eight new species have been discovered in a new genus. However, many more remote provinces and regions have not been explored in detail. In the past, the governments of the United States, Japan, and Annam all used great efforts to investigate tree species and compile huge and exquisite forest plant atlases. Our country should not lag behind again. Fortunately, various domestic biological research institutions have long-term collection and research. If a larger amount of money is allocated specifically for this purpose, such as the United States Department of Agriculture entrusting the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University to compile the "North American Tree Flora," it will not be difficult to complete this great undertaking within ten years.</p>
<p>(B) Survey of forest area</p>
<p>What can be carried out at the same time as the survey of tree species is the survey of forest area. What kinds of trees are all the forests in the provinces composed of? How much area does a certain forest occupy? There has never been a large-scale survey. This kind of investigation is an urgent task. If there is this kind of survey in the whole country, when you want to use a certain kind of wood, it is not difficult to follow the map, and you can know how much its forest area is, which is enough to supply such a big market, and you can determine the development plan.</p>
<p>(C) Testing of material properties and identification of wood</p>
<p>Using wood anatomical properties to identify the types of wood is as important as surveying tree species. Since our country has been promoting afforestation for more than 30 years, no one has devoted themselves to this. This research was initiated by the Jing Sheng Biological Investigation Institute. The institute has collected wood from Hebei, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces, and has studied the wood anatomy of more than 400 species. Almost all genera of important softwood and hardwood have been collected, laying a rough foundation for this research. If the funding for this research can be increased and given time, the wood anatomy of all the trees in the country can be studied, and foresters and industrialists will have a guide. As for material property testing, it is necessary to purchase wood testing machines and collect large quantities of wood for testing, which is very expensive, so the Jing Sheng Biological Investigation Institute has not been able to carry out this work for the time being. However, the specific gravity of more than 400 kinds of wood has been studied. This type of research has already begun. Although other industrial research institutions have also done this research, because no one can identify tree species, it is not easy to obtain wood, so large-scale research has not been possible. If special funds are allocated to purchase wood testing machines and for large-scale collection, the foundation for all wood utilization in China can be laid, and the source of wood for industrial, military, papermaking, and railway sleepers will be known.</p>
<p>(D) Research on afforestation</p>
<p>Today's afforestation is done without testing, so the results are not good and often fail. It is appropriate to collect seeds of all important trees to study their afforestation needs, so that future afforestation practitioners will have something to follow. Today, European and American countries are promoting afforestation with hybrid poplars because they grow extremely fast. Fifteen years of growth can equal fifty years of other trees. In the future, if the suitability of the climate and soil is studied, it will not be difficult to cause a revolution in our country's forestry by using it for large-scale afforestation, and the problems of papermaking and other wood can be solved. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e94">Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Technical Expert of the National Health Administration <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Suen</p>
<p>Definition: People should already have a considerable understanding of the term "infectious disease." Regarding the content of infectious diseases, if analyzed according to the nature of the disease, it can be divided into two types: direct transmission and indirect transmission. If divided by time, there is also the saying of "epidemic," which is when a certain infectious disease is most prevalent in a certain season, sometimes called "pandemic," such as influenza and epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis. There are also several infectious diseases that are often more prevalent in a certain area, and stop transmitting immediately when moved to another place. This is divided by region and is also called "endemic disease." The pathology of infectious diseases has been studied and experimented by many medical experts, and they all agree that diseases have their own causes. Generally speaking, infectious diseases each have their inherent cause and their medium, such as patients and their utensils, as well as pests such as mosquitoes, flies, fleas, lice, etc., and animals such as rats and dogs. There is also a type of person who does not have symptoms themselves, but can transmit germs to others, and we call this type of person "carriers." In short, the occurrence of diseases all have their individual causes, and infectious diseases have their own transmission routes. At the same time, prevention methods also differ. The transmission routes of infectious diseases can be divided into four categories, which are specifically described as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Contact group. The first disease to be mentioned in this group is smallpox. The source of smallpox is an ultrafilterable microorganism. This disease is most easily transmitted by contact with patients. For example, the nasal and oral excretions of patients when they are recovering, toys, and the patient's clothing, etc., can also be the medium of transmission. The second is measles. Measles is the most easily transmitted disease in children. The pathogen of this disease is still not clear, and the transmission route is similar to smallpox. The third is meningitis. This pathogen is a diplococcus, and the transmission route is mostly by direct contact with patients or close contact with carriers. In addition, diseases such as scarlet fever, venereal diseases, skin diseases, and trachoma are all diseases transmitted by contact.</p>
<p>2.  Respiratory group. The first disease to be mentioned in this group is diphtheria. The pathogen of diphtheria is a bacillus that invades the throat. It can be transmitted by kissing, shaking hands, and talking with patients or carriers. It is also easy to transmit by touching the patient's food, utensils, chopsticks, and other items. The second is influenza. The pathogen of influenza has not yet been determined, but it spreads rapidly. Among ethnic groups that have not been infected, many die from this disease. During the worldwide influenza pandemic from 1918 to 1919, more than 200 million people were infected, and more than 10 million died. In the United States, in less than half a year, 20 million people were infected, and more than 400,000 died. From June to November 1918, in five months, more than 4 million people in India died from this disease. However, among ethnic groups that have already been infected with this disease, although the infection rate is high, the mortality rate is not high. The transmission route is the same as diphtheria. The next is pneumonia. The pathogen is the pneumonia bacillus. The transmission route is similar to diphtheria and influenza, but overwork, cold, and colds can also induce this disease. In addition, diseases in the contact group can sometimes be transmitted through the respiratory tract.</p>
<p>3.  Digestive group. Regarding infectious diseases of the digestive system, there are cholera, typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, and dysentery. The pathogens of these three diseases are all bacteria, and the transmission routes are almost exactly the same. However, cholera is the most severe, and the mortality rate is very high. I remember that in 1921, there was a cholera pandemic in China. The total number of patients reached more than 150,000, and the number of deaths was more than 50,000. According to statisticians, cholera is expected to have a major epidemic every five years from a statistical point of view. Since there was a major epidemic in 1921, there may still be an epidemic in 1926, which depends on how the prevention work is carried out. The course of typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever is relatively slow, but they are very prevalent in China, and patients can be seen anywhere at any time. In various civilized and advanced countries, due to the perfection of public health facilities, typhoid fever and other diseases have almost disappeared. If there is a case of typhoid fever in the community, medical schools will have the opportunity to practice. Dysentery can be divided into two types, and the nature of the disease is also different. One is bacterial dysentery, which is prevalent in summer and autumn and is easy to treat and prevent. The other is amoebic dysentery, also known as protozoal dysentery. Patients' conditions are sometimes mild and sometimes severe, and it is easy to become a chronic disease, but it is not easy to spread. As for the transmission route, the three diseases are mostly caused by overeating, drinking raw water, and unclean cold foods and drinks, as well as bad environments such as many flies and improper disposal of waste, which can also spread the disease. In addition, most general gastrointestinal diseases originate from dietary habits, which still need to be improved.</p>
<p>4.  Inoculation group. There are several infectious diseases that must go through an intermediate host, such as malaria, which must first be bred in the mosquito's body before being transmitted to the human body. There is a very interesting story to be told, that is, when the mosquito that transmits malaria sucks human blood, it must first spit out the liquid in its body before sucking human blood. If the liquid it spits out contains malaria parasites, then the person bitten by the mosquito may develop malaria. The diseases belonging to the parasitic category, such as kala-azar, are mostly caused by white gnats as intermediate hosts. These parasites either enter the skin directly through insect vectors, or are excreted from the body in feces, and then enter the digestive tract through food, directly reaching the internal organs. They then grow and reproduce, either in the intestines, lungs, liver, or blood, to obtain the body's nutrients, destroy tissues, produce toxins, or block ducts, resulting in various physiological disorders. Because this type of disease is infectious, it is also called an infectious disease.</p>
<p>Now that we know how to prevent infectious diseases, we will go a step further. We need to know the sanitary methods of prevention. Now it is divided into two aspects to explain. A. Personal aspects: Infectious diseases are not castles in the air. They all have their transmission factors, and they each have their own vectors when transmitting. Therefore, when it comes to prevention, it should also be explained by category—for infectious diseases in the contact group, the first thing healthy people should do is to separate themselves from patients. This is the "isolation" that the medical community often talks about. When encountering similar patients, they should also not shake hands or talk with them. The second is to implement preventive vaccination, such as vaccinating against smallpox and injecting vaccines against meningitis. For the prevention methods of infectious diseases in the gastrointestinal group, attention should be paid to daily diet. Water should not be drunk unless it has been boiled. At the same time, it must first be known that cold drinks are made from hot water. Attention should be paid to the freshness of food and drink. A good sanitary habit should be developed for diet, and infectious diseases in the gastrointestinal group can be prevented. Preventive injections can also be implemented when necessary. To prevent infectious diseases of the respiratory system, in addition to isolating the patients, it is best to avoid participating in crowded places. As for infectious diseases in the inoculation group, individuals should always pay attention to the cleanliness of the environment. It is best not to use suspicious food. Vectors of infectious diseases such as mosquitoes, flies, lice, fleas, and rats should be eliminated at any time. This can avoid the most common types of infectious diseases. If someone is infected with a certain germ, it sometimes depends on the individual's disease resistance. People who usually pay attention to personal hygiene, have good nutrition, and have suitable living habits have increased resistance, and diseases are not easy to develop. B. Public aspects: We know that the methods of preventing diseases implemented by individuals are relatively easy to implement and effective, but the social environment is too bad, and each individual's environment is different, so the methods of preventing infectious diseases also differ. The first thing to pay attention to is:</p>
<p>1.  Environmental improvement. Social environmental sanitation facilities include: Toilet problems—General public toilets should be built with fly-proof screens and doors. At the same time, attention should be paid to management, cleaning, or timely disinfection. In general, unhygienic toilets should be thoroughly guided for improvement, so that toilet construction and management are appropriate and the breeding of flies is reduced. Diet problems—Infectious diseases in the gastrointestinal group are mostly caused by drinking water, so the provision of safe water (tap water) by society is a public health issue. Every summer, Shanghai opens tap water for free use by the general poor, so the number of patients with infectious diseases in the gastrointestinal group has decreased in recent years. This is the most appropriate method of disease prevention, but there are many places without tap water. Ideally, tap water should be installed in various places. The second best option is to find ways to clean the water source, disinfect drinking water, and guide people to develop the habit of drinking boiled water. Problems with the disposal of waste and garbage—The general public still does not know how to pay attention to the disposal of waste and garbage, so society should have responsible agencies or personnel to destroy all waste and garbage to maintain the environmental sanitation of society. Problem of eliminating mosquitoes and flies—Mosquitoes, flies, rats, dogs, etc. are all vectors of infectious diseases, so environmental sanitation facilities should pay attention to eliminating mosquitoes and flies and killing stray dogs and rats at any time and anywhere. There are still many environmental sanitation matters, such as the construction of houses, light transmission and ventilation, and safety equipment in general groups.</p>
<p>2.  Medical and pharmaceutical prevention. The prevention work in the medical and pharmaceutical field is to use the principle of artificial immunity to carry out organized and systematic vaccination work according to the season. Vaccination is the same as vaccination and smallpox vaccination. It is now recognized by the world as having special effects, such as smallpox vaccination to prevent smallpox. Injecting typhoid and cholera mixed vaccines can prevent typhoid and cholera. Injecting diphtheria toxoid can prevent diphtheria. All places in society with public health agencies should have this medical and pharmaceutical facility to prevent infectious diseases.</p>
<p>3.  Health education. The study of the theory of infectious diseases is a very difficult thing. However, the pathogen and pathology of infectious diseases are very simple, and have already been explained in the previous section. As for prevention methods, personal aspects are certainly not a difficult thing, but only by hoping that the whole society will implement them consistently can this be done. This can only be done by adopting the method of education so that everyone knows the knowledge of infectious diseases and the methods of preventing infectious diseases. This is one of the biggest goals of health education. However, when it comes to health education, there is still the training of applicable health workers to expand the scope of epidemic prevention. The public should also spread the knowledge they have gained.</p>
<p>The above three points have all gone beyond the scope of individual ability. This must be promoted by the government or public groups in order to be effective. Therefore, an issue that arises incidentally is that local governments need to discuss the organization for promoting public health. At present, most local governments have health sections within the Public Security Bureau, which only passively carry out some medical and pharmaceutical crackdown work, which cannot meet the needs of today's society. Provincial health experiment offices are being established in various provinces one after another, health bureaus are being established in various cities, and health centers or county hospitals are being established in various counties, but many provinces, cities, and counties have still failed to promote public health work in an organized manner. This is the most important prerequisite for preventing infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Treatment: There are already special treatments for infectious diseases, such as quinine for treating malaria, organic arsenic drugs such as compound 914 for treating syphilis, and santonin for treating roundworms. This is already known to everyone. The treatment of other diseases, such as diphtheria antitoxin treatment, is often complicated and cannot be explained in a short time, so I will not introduce it for the time being. However, there are several diseases for which there is still no special medicine that can be treated scientifically, but by starting from the aspect of caring for the patient's life, the condition can gradually improve until recovery. For example, for typhoid fever, as long as the patient's diet is controlled and the patient is completely bedridden, this is a method of nursing care that temporarily replaces treatment. There is also measles, which also has no special medicine that can be treated. Only by using nursing methods to maintain a balanced temperature in the patient's room and prevent other complications can the patient naturally recover within a considerable amount of time. In addition, there are many types of infectious diseases in which the treatment may still be awaiting the invention of drugs, or even the use of diet and nutrition instead of treatment. This is exactly the situation of modern medical evolution.</p>
<p>Conclusion: We know that there are very few special medicines for the treatment of infectious diseases. At the same time, due to the poor social environment, there are very many opportunities for the spread of infectious diseases. If you wait until you are sick before seeking medical treatment, the time and economic costs are not appropriate. What's more, the distribution of the number of doctors in our country is also impossible. Therefore, if we want to talk about the health of the nation today, the work of preventing infectious diseases is probably thousands of times better than the treatment of diseases! The work of preventing diseases is more important than treatment, but the work of preventing diseases must be carried out in cooperation between the government and the people. The people must earnestly implement a healthy life, and the government should also strive to build health. Only then can human life gradually progress and social civilization can be renewed day by day. (The End)</p>

<p>The Number Minted Has Been Handed Over to the Central Bank for Exclusive Issuance. Chen Jian'an Has Gone to Beijing to Report to Minister Kong.</p>
<p>According to the New Voice Agency, after the Central Mint was ordered to mint subsidiary coins, the minted copper half-cent and one-cent coins and the nickel five-cent, ten-cent, and twenty-cent coins, totaling five types of subsidiary coins, have been reviewed and found to be in compliance with the subsidiary coin regulations. They have been packed and sent to the Central Bank in preparation for issuance and circulation on the market starting from the 10th. The Ministry of Finance's announcement is recorded as follows: It is hereby announced that the subsidiary coin regulations have been promulgated and implemented by the National Government, and the Ministry has ordered the Central Mint to actively mint the coins. These subsidiary coins have now been minted and stored in large quantities, and should be issued urgently for circulation. It is hereby stipulated that the 10th of this month shall be the date of issuance of subsidiary coins. In addition to submitting a report to the Executive Yuan for transmission to the National Government for the record and distributing it to various places, this announcement is hereby issued for public knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Chen Xing Went to Beijing to Report to Kong <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Chen Jian'an, Vice President of the Central Bank and Director of the Central Mint, went to Beijing from Shanghai the night before last to report to Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi on the minting of subsidiary coins. In order to reorganize the subsidiary coins and miscellaneous notes, a committee was specially organized, and leaders of the silver and money industry were invited to serve as members. The number of members has been determined to be fifteen, who will be appointed by the Ministry of Finance. It is decided to establish the committee within the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Review Standing Committee: Amendment to Regulations <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Central Mint Review Committee held a regular meeting at 4:30 PM on the 14th of this month in the conference room on the third floor of the Central Bank. The meeting included reports on committee affairs. It was noted that Articles 7 and 9 of the committee's regulations originally only stipulated reviews of new coins minted by the Central Mint and ingots, excluding subsidiary coinage. Now, a decision has been made to amend the regulations to include provisions regarding the fineness and weight of subsidiary coinage.</p>
<p>The Value of Twenty-Cent Coins Collapses: Each Yuan Rises to 12.20 Cents, Hoarders Dumping Double Dimes for Legal Tender</p>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, on November 4th of last year, the Ministry of Finance stipulated exchange rates: one yuan of legal tender could be exchanged for twelve cents in small foreign coins, five hundred wen for double dimes, and three thousand wen for copper coins. At one point, some people in the market were buying up twenty-cent coins, causing the premium to rise sharply. The black market price for double dimes reached a high of eleven cents and one fen. Recently, twenty-cent coins have been circulating with excellent credit, and the market demand for double dimes has decreased daily. Those who hoarded them also felt the pain of not generating interest, and merchants who had hoarded them could no longer manipulate the market. As a result, they successively released their holdings, leading to an oversupply of twenty-cent coins. Yesterday, the silver market quoted a premium of seven fen, single dimes at 833.33 yuan per 1000, double dimes at 833.33 yuan per 1000, an exchange rate of 1200 cents, copper coins at 300,000 per unit, blank coin at 350 wen, a premium of 50 wen, and a black market price of 12.23 cents for double dimes. Exchange shops were exchanging at a rate of 12.20 cents, while double dimes were only trading between 480 to 490 wen. There was a surplus on all sides. This reporter inquired with the financial community, and it was said that the reason for this was that the Ministry of Finance had minted new subsidiary coins. Manipulators initially believed that the authorities would immediately buy them up, so they hoarded them. However, the market did not need these silver subsidiary coins, and the authorities did not immediately abolish or melt them down, leading to an oversupply. Those who hoarded them not only failed to profit but suffered losses and had to dump them. Previously, the tram company took in more than 20,000 yuan in double dimes daily, but now, because twenty-cent notes can be exchanged for legal tender without loss, passengers prefer to use twenty-cent coins and disregard double dimes. The daily intake of double dimes has dropped to only 7,000 or 8,000 yuan, indirectly affecting those who hoard double dimes, causing the price of double dimes to shrink. With the imminent circulation of new subsidiary coins, citizens should be happy to use the new coins and avoid exchanging them for miscellaneous coins, which would lead to losses from exchange fees. This proves that after the implementation of the new subsidiary coins, all abnormal conditions will naturally be eliminated, and the people will no longer be subject to exploitation and loss in their daily use.</p>

<p>After the Ministry of Finance ordered the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to act as agents for the Issuance Reserve Management Committee to receive the reserves of various issuing banks, it has now ordered the China Farmers Bank to act as an agent to receive the issuance reserves (60% cash, 40% securities) and all issuance matters of the provincial banks in various provinces. Currently, the bank has been instructed and its branches in various provinces and cities are gradually contacting the provincial banks in each province to engage in receiving the reserves. Subsequently, it is planned to hand over all the issuance reserves received from various banks to the Central Bank for safekeeping.</p>

<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, Dr. Lewis, an American advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, announced his resignation in Shanghai yesterday.

After the September 18th Incident, when the Lytton Commission came to China, he was assigned as a Chinese staff member of the commission and a member of the drafting committee for the commission's report. From 1932 to 1933, he went to Geneva to serve as an advisor to the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations Assembly, making many contributions to China's diplomacy.

<h3 id="e102">German Goodwill Visit Ship Will Head Straight to Japan, Bypassing China, German Community's Telegram Protesting Ship Visiting Shanghai Unsuccessful, Captain Siemens Carries 600 Officers and Soldiers <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, the cruiser "Karlsruhe," dispatched by the German government for goodwill visits to various countries, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday morning after passing through Batavia and the Philippines. According to news received from semi-official German sources in Shanghai, the ship will stay in Hong Kong for ten days and then head directly to Japan without passing through Shanghai. It is also scheduled to visit the United States via the Aleutian Islands before returning to Germany after a ten-day stay in Japan. Six years ago, the German parliament sent the Emden warship to visit China, staying in both Beijing and Shanghai for a long time. Three years ago, the Köln warship was sent to Shanghai and Qingdao. At a time when rumors of a military alliance between Japan and Germany are rife, the German community is quite suspicious that the ship will head directly to Japan without passing through China. It is rumored that the German community in Shanghai telegraphed in advance to protest, hoping that it would visit Shanghai, but it was ineffective, which greatly dissatisfied the German community. It is also learned that the ship's captain is Mr. Siemens, and it carries 600 officers and soldiers. The ship was built in 1927, has a displacement of 6,000 tons, is 186 yards long, and 17 yards wide, with a speed of 32 knots per hour. It is armed with nine 15-centimeter guns, four 8.8-centimeter anti-aircraft guns, eight 3.7-centimeter guns, and twelve No. 50 submarines. Because Germany is restricted by the Treaty of Versailles from building warships over 6,000 tons, the "Karlsruhe" is currently the largest warship in Germany.</p>

<p>After seizure, should be handed over to the bureau to be forwarded to the court for disposal; those who confiscate directly will be charged with intent to embezzle</p>
<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, the Ministry of Finance has stated that if public security bureau officers and police seize smuggled silver coins and silver items, the person and the silver should be sent to the local public security bureau for interrogation. If confiscation is warranted, a receipt should be issued immediately. Officers and police should not confiscate directly to prevent abuse. The Ministry of Finance has sent a cable to the provincial, municipal, and county governments to instruct all relevant agencies to investigate. The original cable from the Ministry of Finance is recorded below: It has recently been reported that public security bureau officers and police in various provinces and cities confiscate smuggled silver coins and silver items without issuing receipts, which has led to abuse. Please instruct them to correct this. In cases where public security officers and police seize smuggled silver coins and silver items, they should be handed over to the local public security bureau for processing. If there is concealment or intent to evade taxes, the public security authorities should forward them to the court for prosecution in accordance with the Emergency Law for Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China. However, for silver coins and silver items directly confiscated by the public security bureau, a receipt should be issued as evidence. In the future, in cases where officers and police seize smuggled silver coins and silver items, the person and the silver should be sent to the public security bureau for interrogation. If confiscation is warranted, a receipt should be issued immediately. Officers and police should not confiscate directly, and violators will be charged with intent to embezzle, in order to prevent abuse. In addition to sending a separate cable, this cable is for investigation, and you are requested to instruct the affiliated public security bureaus to comply.</p>

<p>Polish engineer accompanies to be responsible for installation and testing</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Railway Company ordered a large locomotive from the Polish Poznan Jelski Company last year. The company shipped it last winter on the Blackby Forde, from the port of Gdansk, Poland, to Shanghai. It arrived in port on January 20, unloaded at Wusong, and the company specially sent engineer Okinsek and mechanic Lonecki with the ship to China, responsible for unloading and testing. The tests in Shanghai were very satisfactory. It was transported to Nanjing by the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway the day before yesterday, and representatives from the Jiangnan Company and the Polish engineer and mechanic also went. According to Polish engineer Okinsek, Poland's heavy industry has developed extraordinarily in recent years, and its production of various machinery, armaments, airplanes, etc. is very high, especially railway materials such as railway bridges, locomotives, passenger cars, etc. The prices are very low, and they are strong and durable. Many countries such as the Soviet Union, Romania, Turkey, and other European countries order from Poland. The Songhua River Railway Bridge in Harbin, China, was built by the Warsaw Lotzky Company of Poland. This is the first time that China has ordered locomotives on a trial basis, and it is hoped that various routes will be able to purchase and use them in the future. He also said that Polish railways already use streamlined locomotives and passenger cars, but because the speed is very high, heavier tracks must be used.</p>

<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, the International Trade Bureau announced the trends in China's international trade last year, stating that although foreign trade in the 24th year of the Republic of China still showed signs of contraction in terms of total value, an analysis of imports and exports revealed that exports increased by 7% compared to the previous year due to the stimulus of low silver prices. Conversely, import trade decreased by 10% compared to the previous year due to the increase in tariff prices and a subsequent decline in the import of foreign goods. Generally speaking, foreign trade in the 24th year of the Republic of China had already shown signs of improvement. In terms of import and export commodities, tung oil was the most important export commodity, valued at over 41.58 million yuan. Silk was second, valued at over 40.23 million yuan. Eggs and egg products were third, valued at 32.06 million yuan. Metals and metal products were fourth, valued at 31.67 million yuan. In addition, tea, tanned hides and leather goods, and cotton were each valued at over 20 million yuan. Peanut cotton yarn, grains and products, wool, drawn thread, ramie, and pig bristles also had export values of over 15 million yuan. Compared to the previous year, most commodities increased, with tung oil increasing by 59%. The main market remained the United States, accounting for 70% of total exports. Exports to Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands also increased compared to the previous year. Silk exports also increased by over 41% compared to the previous year. However, in terms of silk categories, apart from white silk, which increased by over 13 million yuan, other types such as dougong silk, grey silk, and waste silk also increased, but only slightly. Yellow silk tended to decline, by about one-sixth. The United States was the largest overseas market, valued at over 13.7 million yuan, with white silk accounting for the majority. Annual sales exceeded three times that of the previous year. France was second to the United States, valued at over 12.53 million yuan, also with white silk accounting for the majority. Sales last year exceeded twice that of the previous year. In addition, India remained a market for Chinese silk, valued at 4.08 million yuan, with yellow silk accounting for almost all of it. However, the sales value was lower than the previous year. The export situation for eggs and egg products was good last year, increasing by 6% compared to the previous year. The United Kingdom remained the largest market, valued at over 18.46 million yuan. The United States was second, valued at 4.62 million yuan. Germany was third, valued at 2.84 million yuan. In addition, exports to Hong Kong, the Netherlands, and other places each reached over 1 million yuan. Compared to the previous year, there was no increase or decrease in the United Kingdom, a slight increase in Germany and France, and brisk sales in the United States. Metal and metal products also increased in exports last year compared to the previous year. Tin ingots and antimony accounted for the majority, with more than two-thirds being shipped to Hong Kong, valued at 19.98 million yuan. Among other commodities, only tea saw a decline in sales in the United Kingdom and Russia. Exports last year decreased by 16% compared to the previous year. Fortunately, sales in Morocco were brisk, otherwise the decline would have been even greater. The decline in cotton yarn was even more severe, decreasing by 39% compared to the previous year. Exports to Japan and Korea last year were only one-third of the previous year. Exports of hides and leather goods also decreased by 16%. Goat skin and lambskin saw the most significant decline. The United States remained the largest export market, but sales in both Europe and the United States declined. Silk exports also declined, decreasing by 31% compared to the previous year. Sales in Hong Kong, India, and the United Kingdom all declined. The failure of silk last year can be seen here. As for cotton, peanuts, and sesame, exports all increased sharply last year. Wool, pig bristles, grains, and other items all saw slight increases. Overall, the prosperity of native product exports last year was a rare phenomenon in recent years. As for major import commodities, rice once again ranked first last year, valued at 50.9 million gold units, an increase of 52% compared to the previous year. The majority of imported rice came from Annam, valued at 28.85 million gold units. In addition, large amounts were imported from Siam and India. Copper and iron were second, valued at 40.39 million gold units, a decrease of 9% compared to the previous year. The main sources remained Germany and the United Kingdom, each reaching 8 to 9 million gold units. In addition, imports from the United States and Japan each reached over 5 million gold units. Machinery (including machine tools) ranked third, valued at 35.41 million gold units, an increase of 17% compared to the previous year. Electrical machinery and other unnamed machinery saw the most significant increase. As for textile machinery, there was no increase or decrease. Engine machinery, on the other hand, declined. The majority of imported machinery came from Germany, valued at 8.94 million gold units. Imports from the United Kingdom and Japan were also over 7 million gold units each. Imports from the United States were valued at 5.3 million gold units. Cotton ranked fourth, valued at 22.78 million gold units, a sharp decrease of half compared to the previous year. The majority still came from the United States, valued at 12.97 million gold units. Imports from India were second, valued at over 6 million gold units. Rubber ranked fifth, valued at 20.94 million gold units, an increase of 20% compared to the previous year. The majority came from the United States, followed by Italy, France, and Canada. Kerosene ranked sixth, valued at 20.57 million gold units, an increase of only 1% compared to the previous year. The majority still came from the United States, valued at over 9 million gold units. The Dutch East Indies was second, valued at 8.24 million gold units. Imports from Russia were valued at just over 2 million gold units. Other commodities, in order, were dyes, pigments, chemical products, and pharmaceuticals, each valued at over 20 million gold units. Wheat and timber were each valued at over 19 million gold units. Metal products were valued at 18.83 million gold units. Vehicles and sugar were each valued at over 15 million gold units. Cotton cloth was valued at over 11 million gold units. Wool and wool fabrics, gasoline, and diesel were each valued at over 10 million gold units. In addition, the import value of other foreign goods was less than 10 million gold units. In summary, the import value of major foreign goods generally decreased last year compared to the previous year. The low silver price, the increase in tariff prices, and the weak domestic purchasing power were also major reasons. Only machinery, paper, timber, dyes, pigments, and gasoline saw slight increases, but the amount was minimal. The imports of both rice and wheat increased significantly compared to the previous year, despite the decline in imports. The former increased by 52%, while the latter increased by 22%, which is a deep concern for the livelihood of our people.</p>

<p>Shanghai Electrical Manufacturing Industry Association Sends Letters to Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces Inquiring About Mining Details</p>
<p>According to the New News Agency, the Shanghai Electrical Manufacturing Industry Association believes that copper is a necessary raw material for the industry. Currently, all materials used are imported from abroad. In order to recover rights and interests and block loopholes, it has specifically suggested that the government conduct its own mining and has sent experts to find mine sources. A mine source has now been found near Huangshigang. In order to plan comprehensively, the association has specifically sent letters to the Construction Department of the Yunnan Provincial Government and the Sichuan Peng County Copper Mine Company to inquire about mining details for reference and to facilitate progress. The letter to the Yunnan Construction Department is recorded as follows: "Sir, it has been found that copper is one of the main raw materials for heavy industry. It is especially a necessary raw material for the electrical manufacturing industry. In recent years, China's electrical products have been thriving. However, due to the lack of copper mining in the country, the raw materials still need to be imported from abroad, and profits are inevitably lost, which is regrettable. In view of this, our association has decided to suggest to the government to conduct mining. A mine source has now been found near Huangshigang. However, the various plans regarding the suggestion must be widely adopted and thoroughly researched in order to be comprehensive. It is heard that your department already has copper mining in Yunnan and has achieved considerable results. Therefore, we dare to send a letter to inquire. Please kindly provide guidance, detailing the actual amount of your mine, the mining period, the sales location, and future facilities, so that we can learn from it and facilitate progress. We will be publicly grateful."</p>

The participants enthusiastically decided to collect 1% of the aviation donation based on business income standards. It officially started on the 1st of this month. The collection of the restaurant industry is purely a matter of national enthusiasm for patriotism and automatic willingness to contribute. There is absolutely no coercion. Therefore, since its implementation, in less than ten days, the results have been very impressive. It is hoped that compatriots from all walks of life will work hard to support and jointly participate in this grand event.</p>

<h3 id="e129">The Mechanical Industry Association Assists Factories in Automatically Inspecting Safety Equipment Zhang Zhongjie Talks About the Importance of Industrial Safety <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the issue of factory inspection has been actively carried out by the authorities and has achieved considerable results. The city is full of factories. Although it has been successfully carried out in the urban area, the issue of factory inspection in the concession has not been effectively handled. It is now initiated by the Mechanical Industry Association to automatically inspect the safety equipment of factories. The association has stipulated the automatic inspection method and distributed it to factories for implementation, and has hired industrial safety expert Zhang Zhongjie to assist in the implementation. According to Mr. Zhang's opinions on industrial safety issues, in recent years, some unfortunate events have occurred in national goods factories, which have attracted the attention of the authorities in the Chinese and Concessions, and there have been factory inspections. The Ministry of Industry of our country has specially set up a Central Factory Inspection Office, and on January 21 this year, it held an industrial safety and health exhibition in Beijing. Therefore, the issue of factory safety equipment has been taken seriously by the general public. The main points of inspecting factories are nothing more than hygiene equipment, fire prevention equipment, and the situation of mechanical equipment, etc., and special attention is paid to fire prevention equipment. In fact, hygiene and safety equipment should also be included in the industrial development plan in scientific management, because the health of workers is also the health of productivity, and safety devices are also the safety guarantee of capital and the foundation of business development. Therefore, factories in Europe and the United States do not neglect any safety measures, but my country's industry is suppressed by industrially advanced countries, and there is no room for development. Therefore, the establishment and facilities of general national goods factories are struggling in hardship. Capital and talent are lacking. Since capital is short, equipment has to be simple. Since talent is lacking, it is not known how to improve its facilities. Therefore, we hope that the authorities will take into account the difficulties of the lack of capital and talent in national goods factories, and should not start from the negative mandatory relocation and closure of factories, but should assist in the positive design and planning. There are two ways for the national goods industry to plan hygiene and safety equipment. One is for various national goods factories to jointly hire experts with this kind of specialized knowledge to stipulate this plan, and the other is to negotiate with manufacturers of safe industrial products to make the most economical safety settings. Therefore, on the one hand, the authorities should understand the difficulties of the business, so that the inspection is not suppression but assistance, and on the other hand, the factories should take the initiative to discuss and work hard for safety issues. Now the Shanghai Mechanical Industry Association has regulations for the automatic inspection of factory safety equipment, and it is hoped that the industrial community can take it seriously. In the future, the results will naturally be effective.</p>

<h3 id="e131">China and Foreign Famine Relief Association Plans to Dredge the Quanhe River in Shandong <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The China and Foreign Famine Relief Association at No. 505 Henan Road has always adhered to the purpose of building and relieving disasters. The huge projects that have been held over the years, such as the Lijin Dam in Shandong, the Shishou Dam in Hubei, the Qianli Dam and Dacheng Ditch in Hebei, the Shilushui Canal, the Minsheng Canal in Suiyuan, the Jinghui Canal and the West-Lan Highway in Shaanxi, and other well-drilling and river-dredging projects, either repaired, built, or jointly organized with the government, are all measures to benefit the country and the people and have achieved considerable results. Recently, in response to the request of the Magistrate of Wenshang County, Shandong, the association has undertaken to dredge the Quanhe River and has sent Mr. Zhang Jichun, the chief engineer of the association's engineering department, to inspect. It is said that the Quanhe River originates from the mountain springs northeast of Wenshang County and flows into Shushan Lake southwest of the county seat, with a total length of 80 li. Every summer flood season, the water level rises sharply, the river is rapid, and the disaster of flooding is inevitable every year. The victims, calculated along 170 villages along the river, are no less than 40,000. The loss of agricultural products is about 800,000 yuan per year. The dredging plan requires 1.6 million cubic meters of mud for embankment construction. In addition to the dredging of the river, it is planned to collect mud from nearby. If 10,000 workers are hired every day, it will take 80 days to complete. The wages for each person per day, calculated at 20 cents in national currency, will cost 160,000 yuan. The county government, hindered by funds, in addition to recruiting 8,500 workers locally to engage in work, the remaining 1,500 people will be recruited from neighboring counties. The required wages of 24,000 yuan, and the cost of tools and supervisors, about 3,000 yuan, are requested to be borne by the China and Foreign Famine Relief Association. It is heard that the plan has been submitted to the Executive Committee of the association for discussion, and once the decision is made, construction will begin on a selected day.</p>
<h3 id="e132">This City's Traditional Chinese Medicine Circles Telegraph Their Thanks for the Promulgation of the Chinese Medicine Ordinance <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine Association [上海市國醫公會], believing that the Chinese Medicine Ordinance [中醫條例] had long been drafted and passed by the Legislative Yuan [立法院] but not yet promulgated, causing the medical and pharmaceutical circles nationwide to have nothing to follow, after Chairman Chiang [蔣委員長] was honorably appointed as Vice Chairman of the Central Political Council [中政會副主席] and President of the Executive Yuan [行政院院長], immediately submitted the Chinese Medicine Ordinance to the National Government [國府], which was clearly promulgated on January 20th, thus solidifying the foundation of traditional Chinese medicine, specially telegraphed their thanks yesterday. The original text is recorded below: Respectfully addressed to Chiang [蔣], President of the Executive Yuan, the rise and fall of Chinese medicine concerns the national economy and the people's livelihood, which has been universally recognized by all levels. Promoting inherent culture and increasing people's production are even more prescribed by the Premier's [總理] will. Our Central Legislative Yuan, in view of this, drafted the Chinese Medicine Ordinance to restrict mediocrity, support national essence, and take care of both, which pleased the public. However, it was blocked by treacherous officials and not promulgated, which was eagerly anticipated. This time, you, sir [公], even amidst military affairs, took over as the Prime Minister [總揆]. All lands hope for governance, and the masses rejoice. First, the long-shelved Chinese Medicine Ordinance was clearly promulgated and immediately implemented. With love and respect, we respectfully lead all members to telegraph our gratitude and also beg for timely support so that inherent culture can be promoted and the people's livelihood and economy can be improved. Chinese medicine is fortunate, and the entire people are fortunate. Respectfully, Xue Wenyuan [薛文元], Guo Boliang [郭柏良], Gu Weichuan [顧渭川], Ding Zhongying [丁仲英], and Qin Bowei [秦伯未], Standing Committee Members of the Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine Association, lead all members in paying their respects.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that after the Chinese Medicine Ordinance was passed by the Legislative Yuan, it was delayed in promulgation due to various reasons. This time, through the efforts of Director Jiao [焦館長] of the Central National Medicine Museum [中央國醫館] and the resolute leadership of President Chiang [蔣院長] of the Executive Yuan, it was submitted and passed by the Central Political Council and promulgated by the National Government on the 22nd of last month. The status of Chinese medicine has been established here. The medical and pharmaceutical circles nationwide are praising it in unison. To commemorate this, the entire faculty, staff, and more than two hundred students of the New China Medical College [新中國醫學院] on Wang Jia Sha [王家沙] Flower Garden Road in this city, in addition to jointly holding a celebration meeting with the city's medical and pharmaceutical circles at the Chao Society [潮社] on that day and inviting medical doctors Mei Zhuosheng [梅卓生] and Zhu Henian [朱鶴年] to give lectures at the college, telegraphed President Chiang [蔣院長] and Director Jiao [焦館長] six days earlier to express their gratitude and support. The wording is omitted for brevity. It is heard that the college has officially started classes on the 5th, and the students are quite crowded. The research institute and hospital are scheduled to be established on March 10th, and human body models, chemical testing equipment, etc., have been arranged completely.</p>
<h3 id="e133">This City's Judicial Authorities Take the First Step in Promoting the Notary System <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Various Regulations Are Being Submitted to the Central Political Council for Review</p>
<p>Da Gong She [大公社] reports that the judicial administration department [司法行政部], following the precedents of European and American countries, is preparing to implement the notary system. The judicial authorities of this city, in order to promote this notary system, have formulated regulations, including (1) Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Notary Rules [公證暫行規則施行細則], (2) Notary Fee Rules [公證費用規則], and 25 other types of thin books, booklets and forms. Once the various regulations are successively approved and promulgated, the judicial organs of this city will be the first to conduct trials. In the future, the parties applying for notary matters will need to have the following main procedures ready with the court: (1) creating a notarized document (created by the court based on the party's application), (2) authenticating private documents (created by private individuals and authenticated by the court). The advantage of the notary system is that all public and private contracts and agreements, once a notarized document is created, or a private document is legally recognized by the court, its legally binding force is stronger than ordinary contracts. Because according to the proposed provisional rules, it is stipulated that all notarized documents related to monetary compensation in civil lawsuits shall state that in the event of forced execution of the case, the parties may directly request the court for execution without court adjudication. Therefore, from this point alone, its general effectiveness can be imagined.</p>

At that time, all senior Chinese and Western staff members of the Melchers Agency will be on board to host the event. If various circles wish to visit, they can send a letter to the agency to request tickets (but it must be in the name of a merchant; individual personal tickets will not be issued). The steamer is scheduled to leave Shanghai the day after tomorrow (Sunday) at 10 AM, heading to Yokohama and Kobe in Japan. It will then return to Germany on the 19th with passengers from Shanghai on the 16th for its maiden voyage.</p>

<p>Only 70 People Are Allowed to Remain; Otherwise, Closure Will Be Ordered</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She [新聲社] reports that the Gong Ming [公明] Electric Bulb Factory at No. 4, Hexing Lane [和興里], in the French Concession, has been open for eight years, registered with the Social Affairs Bureau [社會局], and obtained a license from the French Municipal Council. It is a well-known national electric bulb manufacturer. Because the original workers were insufficient, they successively increased the number of workers and expanded the factory site. Unexpectedly, it was repeatedly interfered with and punished by the French Municipal Council. The factory painfully paid the fines, thinking that it would be fine, but on the 27th of last month, the Municipal Council, together with the Health Department and the Fire Department, sent personnel to claim that only 70 people were allowed to work; otherwise, the business would be ordered to close by the 5th of this month. The police even sent a fire truck to the factory and used a hose to spray water to force it to stop working, causing the factory to suffer great losses. Now, the factory, unable to withstand the oppression, has reported the situation to the Electric Appliance Manufacturing Industry Association [電器製造業同業公會] for relief. It is heard that the association, in order to protect the rights of its members, and because the Ministry of Industry is now paying attention to national goods factories, and the Social Affairs Bureau is doing its best to protect registered factories, plans to submit a petition to higher-level authorities to forcefully argue with the French Concession authorities.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal National Goods Year Movement Meeting [上海市市民國貨年運動會] sent a letter to various national goods organizations yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, this meeting, in view of the mediocre results of the previous National Goods Year, Women's National Goods Year, and Student National Goods Year, and the lack of significant progress, believes that this year's Municipal National Goods Year is an entire Shanghai municipal national goods movement. Moreover, the general public mostly blindly follows and is passive, and the fundamental solution is for factories to produce more national raw materials and shops to sell more national goods. An ancient poem says, 'Profit has a knife beside it; greedy people harm themselves.' We should especially broaden our horizons, not be greedy for the slightly thicker interest at present, and ruin the country in an irreparable place. Ancestral graves and the happiness of future generations cannot be guaranteed. Fortunately, your association will immediately relay and earnestly advise, so that the national goods movement spreads throughout the country, and the country's limited money will no longer be wasted by those who are fond of foreign things. The melon under the yellow vine cannot be picked again. It is our wise gentlemen who will surely enable the intentions of this meeting to be implemented without limit. Specially, I extend my best wishes for planning and security."</p>

<h3 id="e138">The Cattle and Sheep Industry Association Discussed Opposition to the Border Crossing Tax Yesterday <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Three Measures Were Agreed Upon; Continued Request for Negotiations</p>
<p>The French Concession Public Works Bureau [法租界公董局] recently enacted a new cattle and sheep border crossing tax, which came into effect in January 1936. The Shanghai Cattle and Sheep Industry Association [上海市牛淩晨業同業公會] listed various reasons why the border crossing tax was unreasonable in a letter to the French Public Works Bureau last month, requesting its cancellation. Now, the French Public Works Bureau has replied, stating that it cannot be cancelled. More than one hundred companies of the entire industry have jointly requested the association to find a way to deal with it. After receiving the letter, the association believed that the French Concession Public Works Bureau's newly added exorbitant taxes and levies were indeed unreasonable and had a great impact on the livelihoods of the entire industry. Therefore, it convened a meeting of all employees at 3 PM on the 7th of this month, presided over by Chen Guanghai [陳廣海], the chairman of the association. Three measures were agreed upon: (1) Continue to request the Municipal Chamber of Commerce [市商會], the Municipal Government [市政府], and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession [法租界納稅華人會] to negotiate with the Director of the French Public Works Bureau to quickly cancel the tax. (2) Notify the entire industry to temporarily suspend the transportation of cattle and sheep through the French Concession until the case is satisfactorily resolved. (3) If the French Concession authorities insist on acting arbitrarily, unite the entire industry and unanimously refuse to slaughter cattle and sheep at the slaughterhouse in the French Concession and refuse to purchase the post-slaughter inspection tickets that the Public Works Bureau requires each beef shop to pre-purchase each month. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e139">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Explains That Receipts and Insurance Policies Do Not Need to Be Stamped <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce [上海市商會] sent a letter to the Asia Petroleum Company [亞洲火油公司] yesterday to explain that insurance receipts do not need to be stamped, stating: "The insurance policy is a certificate of rights and can only be considered as a future financial relationship, not a current financial income. Article 16, Section 2 of the Stamp Tax Law only states that any receipt issued after receiving money belongs to the category of money receipts, and does not say that any receipt issued after receiving a future financial relationship belongs to the scope of money receipts. Therefore, this association believes that the receipt issued after receiving the insurance policy does not belong to the scope of money receipts and does not need to be stamped."</p>

The selling price this time is planned to be further reduced in order to quickly get rid of the inventory and facilitate the closure. It will be even more welcomed by customers.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company [上海電話公司] sent a notice to all telephone users yesterday, stating: "The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement [上海公共租界工部局] and the French Municipal Council [法租界工董局] have approved the company's revised telephone tariff regulations, which will take effect on March 1st of this year. This new chapter is revised according to the charging method of calls. Therefore, from March 1st, the general telephone tariff will be calculated according to the number of calls. The calculation method is listed as follows: The number of calls owed by the user is recorded by the motor. Each line has a counter, which is extremely accurate. The recording method of this table is that the call is recorded on the counter of the caller only after the two lines of the caller and the receiver are connected and an echo is received. The table of the receiver will never record. Furthermore, if the dialed phone is busy with another call, or has been connected but there is no echo, the call will not be recorded. Calls to the company's departments (94090), the telephone number inquiry office (09), the repair office (01), emergency calls (00), etc., are not recorded. As for the dedicated lines for commercial use and the outdoor machine lines, they are not included in the above tariffs. The separate table is as follows. The details of the application of the new tariff and other miscellaneous fees will be notified to each user separately. The new tariff and detailed regulations will be printed out soon and displayed in the company's business department for users to refer to and review. Charging method: The company's billing date and method for telephone calls in various districts of this city will still follow the previous example in the February period, but from March 1st, all telephone bills in each district will be calculated in accordance with the new regulations and prepaid from the monthly billing date (monthly fee). The number of local calls exceeding the quota in that month will be calculated until three days before the billing date of the following month. The total number will be calculated at three cents per call and included in the following month's bill. Border calls are also calculated in this way.

<p>Since the entry of the Spring Equinox [立春節] on the 5th, the weather in this city has been extremely hazy, and the air pressure is also low, making it unstable. Yesterday evening at 5:25 PM, hexagonal snowflakes fluttered until about 10 PM late at night, when they were mixed with raindrops.

<p>The case of Western Inspector Peter and Probationary Inspector Gigert [巨特] of the Jiaxing Road [嘉興路] Police Station, accused of deliberately killing Chinese man Ma Debiao [馬德標], was tried for the fourth time yesterday morning by the British Court for China [駐華英國法院]. Doctors and nurses from the Tongren Hospital [同仁醫院] were summoned, all proving that Ma Debiao [馬德標] was wet all over when he was sent to the hospital by ambulance that day. Also, during the interrogation on the afternoon of the previous day, the witness, vegetable vendor Shen Jinsheng [沈金生] (transliteration), who rescued Ma Debiao [馬德標] from the water on the day, was repeatedly questioned by the defendant's lawyers, Ricks [里克斯] and McDonald [麥唐納], and accused of being a rogue and a procurer. Shen immediately denied it and asked the lawyers to provide evidence that he was a rogue and a procurer. Ricks [里克斯] then asked Shen if he lived in a brothel. Shen replied that he was in court to testify, and the lawyer was involving his private matters. Ricks [里克斯] then asked Shen if he had been imprisoned. Shen replied that he had only been detained for smoking opium. McDonald [麥唐納] asked Shen if he dared to swear that he was not a procurer. Shen replied that he was not a procurer. Although there was a brothel in his house, it was a cohabitant and had nothing to do with him. One of the jurors asked Shen if he could recognize English numbers. Shen replied that he could. The juror then wrote the four characters 7043 on a large card and held it up to show him. Shen read it out without hesitation. More than 20 witnesses have been summoned in this case in recent days, and there are still a few others. It is expected that all of them can be interrogated in one or two days, and then the argument will begin.</p>

<p>Discussing Fundamental Opposition to New Telephone System</p>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' Federation, due to the Shanghai Telephone Company's attempt to implement per-call billing, which has aroused opposition from all citizens, has contacted the Municipal Council for negotiation, but without result.  As implementation is imminent and serious disputes are feared, they sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession yesterday, requesting an immediate convocation of a representative assembly of taxpayers to discuss fundamental countermeasures.  The letter stated: We respectfully inform you that the Shanghai Telephone Company's alteration of billing methods has been repeatedly and reasonably contested, and the reasons why the price should not be increased have been reiterated time and again.  However, the company disregards public opinion and insists on implementing the change to achieve its goal of earning one percentage point of profit.  As news spreads, public sentiment is panicking.  The Special District Telephone Issue Committee, in order to adopt public opinion and seek overall countermeasures, has sent separate letters to Chinese and Western ratepayers' associations, requesting the convocation of a general assembly.  This view is the most crucial plan for the present.  Our Federation, as a citizens' group, cannot agree with the company's excuse of profitability while disregarding social economics.  In addition to separately instructing our affiliated district branches to order all committee members and shops to unanimously prepare for a final struggle, we hereby request your association to promptly convene a representative assembly of Chinese taxpayers and raise objections, in order to achieve final victory.  This matter is of utmost importance, so we hope you will not ignore it. This is of the highest importance.  Respectfully addressed to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession.</p>

<p>Wu Huangxiang, 30 years old, from Anhui, resident of No. 13 Jidouli, Xietu Road, Nanshi, is the manager of Yi Feng Enamel Factory, and his business is quite prosperous.  However, he was coveted by bandits.  Yesterday morning around 7 o'clock, three bandits, speaking in local and Jiangbei accents, one wearing a blue cloth long gown, and two wearing blue cloth short jackets, knocked on the back door, falsely claiming important matters at the factory.  At the time, Wu Huangxiang and his wife were still in bed, only the maid was in the living room washing the faces of two girls.  She went to open the door, and the bandits rushed in.  One bandit guarded downstairs, and two bandits, holding guns, went upstairs to watch over Mr. and Mrs. Wu, and searched and plundered extensively.  They robbed cash of 100 yuan, small coins of 200 jiao, a gold woman's wristwatch, a gold pocket watch, a gold ring, a gemstone ring, and a small diamond ring, one of each, two pairs of gold earrings, more than 200 pieces of small pearls, and also Wu's privately owned six-inch Pibei pistol (gun number 6338, gun license 0784), and 50 bullets.  The entire process took about two hours (from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m.).  The bandit downstairs suspected something and went upstairs to peek.

Recently, they opened Room 27 in the apartment at No. 66 Avenue Bugeaud, Avenue Joffre, in the French Concession, organized a fake headquarters, wantonly issued letters of appointment and symbols, sold official positions and titles, and defrauded people for money.  They also sent their gang members Yu Lei, Wang Ziqi, and 15 others to Hankou to carry out fraudulent activities in secret.  On the evening of a certain day, Li, the battalion commander of the Wuhan Garrison Command Military Police Battalion, and others arrested Yu, Wang, and the other 15 people, and seized fake evidence documents, which were sent to the Military Law Office of the Wuhan Garrison Command for investigation.  They confessed to the location of the headquarters in Shanghai, and that Wang or Yu was the brigade commander, Huang Shangmei the staff officer, and Yu Hou the quartermaster, etc.  According to the confession, the Wuhan Garrison Command telegraphed the Shanghai Songhu Garrison, which immediately ordered the Detective Team Inspector Yang Fengqi and Xu Pengfei to report to the French Concession Police and request assistance the day before yesterday afternoon.  They rushed to Room 27 of the Avenue Joffre apartment and arrested Wang Dongyu, Zhang Xueli, and Yu Hou.  Wang and Yu were wearing plain clothes, while Zhang was wearing a military uniform and hat.  They also seized forged official documents, symbols, letters of appointment, seals, etc., all packed in a suitcase, and brought them back to the police station.  According to Wang's confession, he had never been in the military before.  This time, he was ordered by the fugitive Huang to organize a headquarters and raise military funds in Shanghai to be transported to the front lines.  Yesterday, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District, where Judge Li Changnian conducted a preliminary hearing.  Attorney Fei Xizhen of the Police Department stated the case, briefly saying that the defendants were arrested by the Police Department with the assistance of the Garrison Command for impersonating military officers.  Because the Police Department still needed to investigate whether the defendants had committed any crimes in the concession, he requested an adjournment for further questioning.  The investigating detective also reported on the process of assisting in the arrest of the defendants and presented the seized evidence.  Subsequently, Yang Fengqi, the inspector of the Shanghai Songhu Garrison Command, submitted a document to the court, requesting permission to transfer the three defendants so that they could be sent back to Wuhan for trial.  Questioned the defendants confessed to serving as military officers, unknowingly untruthful, as a result of the fugitive Huang family’s duplicity. The court verified the confession and ordered a second hearing on the 14th, and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Young Man Writes Eleven Suicide Notes, Then Poisons Himself <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Corpse Examined By Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Li Jiaju, also known as Haibao, a young man from Ningbo, around 20 years old, recently became unemployed and despondent, leading him to contemplate suicide.  On the afternoon of the 5th, at 5 p.m., he bought raw opium and opened Room 29 at the Chunjiang Second Inn, No. 315 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession.  He ordered the room attendant to bring writing tools and wrote as many as eleven suicide notes, addressed to his parents, maternal uncle, friends, etc., and to the inn, stating the reasons for his suicide.  After finishing writing, he swallowed the raw opium, lay down on the bed, and waited for death to arrive.  At 3 a.m. that night, he groaned in pain due to the poison.  The room attendant, Chen Heshang (43 years old, local), discovered him and reported to the accountant, who immediately hired a car to send Li to Renji Hospital for treatment.  He also reported to the French Concession Police, who dispatched Detective Wu Wengang to investigate.  However, because he was deeply poisoned, the treatment was ineffective. He died at 11 a.m. the next morning.  The hospital reported to the police station, which sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-hall for examination.  The detective summoned the deceased's maternal uncle, Zhu Xiangding (resident of No. 36 Ning'an Lane, Haining Road), to the case.  Yesterday morning, the Second Special District Court dispatched Prosecutor Wang Ren and a forensic medical secretary to the site to determine that the deceased had indeed died from poisoning himself.  They took their seats in the courtroom, and Detective Zhang Chunsheng reported on the investigation process and presented the deceased's suicide notes.  The official questioned the witnesses Chen Heshang and the relative of the deceased, Zhu Xiangding, and examined the suicide notes.  He then ordered that the body be released to Zhu Xiangding for burial and that the suicide notes also be given to Zhu.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Detailed Account of Robbery on Shujin Lane <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>According to Municipal Council news, at approximately 7:40 PM on January 20th, Fudan female student Hu Peihuan was walking from west to east on Nanjing Road near the south side of the road, approximately five yards east of Cifeng Lane. A man approached from behind and snatched her handbag from under Hu's left arm, then escaped southward with another man who had been standing at the entrance of the lane. After passing through Cifeng Lane, the plaintiff shouted loudly that her handbag had been snatched. Thereupon, several pedestrians and Hu chased the escaping defendant. Some people shouted "Catch the robber!" After passing through Cifeng Lane, the robber reached Jiujiang Road and fled into Huajin Lane, continuing south to Hankou Road. During the chase, the second defendant disappeared. As the robber reached Hankou Road, someone blew a police whistle. A large group of people and Hu were chasing him. From Hankou Road, the defendant ran east, and after about ten yards, suddenly turned around and ran west to Shanxi Road. Chinese Constable No. 2211, standing guard at the corner of Hankou Road and Shanxi Road, heard the police whistle and the shouts of "Catch the robber!" He took out his pistol and loaded it, believing that a robbery had occurred. At the same time, the constable was walking east on Hankou Road when he suddenly saw a Chinese man coming from east to west, with his right hand under his short jacket, followed by a crowd. The constable ordered him to stop, but he continued running forward, still keeping his hand under his short jacket. When the man was about five yards away from the constable, he still did not stop, despite the constable repeatedly ordering him to halt. The constable, fearing he was carrying a weapon, fired four shots, hitting him twice. The man fell to the ground on Hankou Road outside No. 359, about thirty yards east of Shanxi Road. When the deceased was caught by Chinese Constable No. 2211, the handbag fell from under his short jacket. The man was immediately sent to Renji Hospital, but was pronounced dead upon arrival. The plaintiff identified the deceased as the person who had robbed her handbag.</p>

<p>City God Temple and Rainbow Temple Crowded with People, Considerable Incense Revenue Throughout the Day</p>
<p>Yesterday was the Lantern Festival, and the City God Temple in the city and the Rainbow Temple on Nanjing Road were both filled with flourishing incense.  From morning to night, the temples were overflowing with worshipers, with a preponderance of lavishly dressed women, adorned with jewels, shimmering accessories, and fragrant clothing, showing extreme elegance. The staff were constantly bowing and prostrating, extremely busy. At the same time, many idle guests lingered in the temple, finding pleasure in mocking others, appearing quite vulgar. According to statistics, the revenue from incense and candles at both temples yesterday was considerable.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Unidentified Man Killed By Bus, Coroner Investigates <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Efforts to Locate Family Unsuccessful, Body Entrusted to Charitable Hall</p>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon around 5 p.m., an unidentified man, about thirty years old, wearing a Zhongshan suit with a yellow raincoat over it, a peaked cap, and leather shoes, resembling a worker, was riding a bicycle No. 13289 from west to east on the Xinzha Road Wuzhen Road Bridge. Unexpectedly, a Route 10 bus No. 15006, driven by Li Fusheng, came speeding from the east. Unable to avoid the collision in time, the bus knocked down the bicycle and the man, rolling them both under the right front wheel. Chinese Constable No. 2417 spotted the incident and immediately reported it to the Xinzha Police Station by telephone, which summoned an ambulance. They managed to pull the man and the bicycle out from under the bus, but the man was already severely injured and barely breathing, and the bicycle was completely crushed. The man was rushed to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died at 1:10 a.m. yesterday morning. Detective Yang Youshan and others from the police station investigated. Because the deceased was unable to speak after being hit, his name and address could not be ascertained. The license plate he was carrying indicated it was from He Dazheng at No. 252 Dalianwan Road, but upon investigation, there was no such address. The body was sent to the Fielun Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Tang and others from the First Special District Court came to the morgue to examine the body. The Western captain reported that the detectives had investigated the scene of the accident and learned that the deceased's bicycle wheel had entered the tram tracks, making it impossible to control, and the front of the bicycle was facing the south bay, causing the collision. He also presented a diagram of the accident scene. Chinese Constable No. 2417 submitted a report on the situation at the time. Mr. Tang then ruled that the unidentified man had been killed by being run over by bus No. 15006. The body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for burial.</p>

<p>Liang Denies Conspiracy To Rob, Judgment Postponed For Seven Days</p>
<p>The Major Robbery case at the North Sichuan Road Postal Administration on September 9th last year, in which a huge sum was stolen, eventually led to the arrest of the ringleader Ji Rentang (alias Wukong Monk) from Jiangbei, and accomplices Qiu Guobin, receiver of stolen goods Li Yisheng, and female accomplices Ji Chenshi, Wang Chenshi, and others. They were sent to the First Special District Court for joint trial, and their confessions were clear. Ji Rentang was sentenced to life imprisonment, and the others were sentenced to varying terms, as reported in this newspaper. Later, on December 3rd of last year, the Dithmarschen Road Police went to Luo'an County, Jiangbei, to extradite Liang Kehe (alias Xiaoguangzi, 32 years old) from Che Ning, who was accused of assisting and instigating the robbery. He was sent to court and testified that he had returned to his hometown at that time to deal with land disputes and entrusted a relative surnamed Cha to handle them. However, in Ji Rentang's confession, his maternal uncle Li San also participated in the robbery. He had previously confessed that he and Li San had tea once at the Tiger Stove on Yucai Road in Zhabei. His testimony was very cunning. The person surnamed Cha works in Nanjing. An order was issued to send a letter to the relevant authorities for consultation. Liang Kehe was detained. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi came to Criminal Court No. 3. An Municipal Council lawyer came to Shanghai from his hometown, selling cloth. He returned to his hometown in July and denied conspiring to rob the post office. He currently does not know the whereabouts of his maternal uncle Li San. He sought judgment. Judge Jiang ruled that he would remain in custody and that the matter would be verified and reviewed again in seven days.</p>

<p>Respectfully, I read your newspaper on February 5th, which contained a news item titled "Ministry of Industry and Commerce Asks the Municipal Government to Investigate the Reasons for the Delay in Company Registration," which stated that our bureau has delayed company registration cases, and that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has asked the Municipal Government to investigate the reasons. After investigation, our bureau has handled thousands of company registration cases. In the past, due to special reasons, some cases were delayed. We have already submitted the reasons for the delay to the Municipal Government's Directive No. 17216, which approved the transfer to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Fearing that the truth is unclear, it is inevitable to confuse the hearing. We hereby send a letter for your review and hope that you will publish the original letter to show the truth. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, February 7th.</p>

<p>Municipal Council Fire Brigade Annual Report for Last Year</p>
<p>Total of 791 Departures Throughout the Year, 47 Lives Lost</p>
<p>The Fire Department of the Municipal Council's 1935 annual report states that the fire brigade departed a total of 791 times for fires and special events this year, a decrease of 209 times compared to the previous year. 47 civilians died in fires, and 5 died in special accidents. The value of property endangered by fire totaled over 115.49 million yuan, an increase of over 30 million yuan compared to the previous year. The actual loss was over 1.534 million yuan, an increase of over 625,000 yuan compared to the previous year. Furthermore, the fire brigade was requested to extinguish fires outside the boundary a total of 36 times this year. For water firefighting, a total of six ships and one barge were rescued. The major fire incidents that can be recorded this year include the two accidental incidents at the Da Zhonghua Baolu Toy Factory on Xiaoshadu Road, in which 27 people died and 62 were injured. Also, the fire at the Denglu Cargo Warehouse at No. 105 Fuzhou Road on Christmas morning was the largest disaster seen by the fire brigade in recent years in terms of surrounding property. The amount of water required for a single dousing reached 1.5 million gallons. (Relocation of the Office) After the fire brigade's main office moved from the Police Department to the Central Police Station building this year, it moved from the original rented house at the corner of Henan Road and Hankou Road to the original site of the Police Department's Traffic Section. (Ambulance Team Affairs) The ambulance team concurrently run by the Fire Department was dispatched a total of 7,239 times this year, of which 5,145 times were for accidental emergency medical conditions, and the rest were for hospitals to use ambulances to transport patients to and from. This is the fifth year that the team has been under the management of the Fire Department. In view of the team's effective work, reducing the pain of accidental injuries and illnesses, it is felt that the team's existence is an indispensable part of the municipality. Furthermore, this year an ambulance was stationed permanently at the Huishan Fire Station. The vehicle was dispatched a total of 409 times. Recently, in view of the increasing prosperity of industry in the eastern district, it is planned to dispatch an ambulance permanently to the Zhoujiazui Fire Station this year. In addition, it is planned to add a motorcycle for use when other vehicles are being repaired. (Traffic Congestion Problem) The most difficult thing for the fire brigade to do when dispatched at present is the traffic congestion on the road, making it difficult to reach the scene of the incident in the shortest possible time. Fortunately, the traffic police avoid and rarely deliberately obstruct the situation. Although there have been many accidents involving fire engines on duty, fortunately the losses are still minor. Only once did a fire engine No. 18 of Yangshupu drive from its station to the scene of the incident and reach the corner of Dalianwan Road and Huade Road, where a cyclist disregarded the police officer's command. The driver wanted to avoid him, causing him to crash into a store on the side of the road. Two firefighters were injured, and the cyclist and a pedestrian were seriously injured and died. (Cases of Arson) In terms of cases of arson, the number of incidents this year has decreased compared to the average number in previous years. There was only one final judgment this year, that is, the owner and accountant of a fabric shop quarreled and set fire to the shop on October 19. Later, the court sentenced the shop owner to three years and six months in prison and the accountant to ten months in prison.</p>
<h3 id="e165">A Visit to Guanshengyuan Farm <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Hua</p>
<p>The three characters "Guanshengyuan" are deeply imprinted in the hearts of the general public. Especially children, who hope their parents will bring back sweets and biscuits produced by Guanshengyuan. When three or four friends are looking for an elegant and delicious place for snacks, they also shout the slogan "Let's go to Guanshengyuan." The success of Guanshengyuan is a story of struggle by its founder, Mr. Xian Guansheng. From a small food stall with a few hundred dollars, it has expanded into a large company with a capital of 500,000 yuan. Now, it has 14 branches and sub-branches across the country, two factories, and one farm and one plum orchard in Meilin. It employs thousands of people, which is truly no easy feat.</p>
<p>Last winter, on December 22nd, this reporter visited the Guanshengyuan Farm in Caohejing with the curator Yi. The facilities and layout were quite satisfactory. The person leading the tour recounted the founding and current status of Guanshengyuan, saying, "The founder of Guanshengyuan, Mr. Xian Guansheng, is from Nanhai, Guangdong, and came from a very humble background. At the age of sixteen, he apprenticed at a food store on Wuma Road. After completing his apprenticeship, he scraped together some small capital and opened a small food store called 'Guanxiang' on the left side of the Hunan New Stage in Shanghai. Later, when the New Stage moved to Mudan Road, Guanxiang also closed down due to sluggish business. Four years later, he opened a Tao Tao Ju food store at the original site of Wing On Company on Nanjing Road. In less than a year, due to the need to demolish and rebuild the building, he had to announce its closure again. In 1918, he and old friends from the opera world, Xia Yueshan and Zheng Zhengqiu, pooled a few hundred dollars to establish Guanshengyuan. They changed their business strategy, promoted profit-making for street vendors, and business boomed. Initially, the products were limited to preserved tangerine peel, fruit juice jelly, beef jerky, and a few other items. The following year, they built their own factory on Xiejiao Jumen Road, established a branch in Hankou, and the number of products increased daily, and sales expanded. In 1923, the capital was increased to 100,000 yuan, and it was reorganized as a limited company. In 1927, the capital was increased by another 50,000 yuan, and the total annual sales exceeded one million yuan. In 1931, the capital was increased by another 150,000 yuan, bringing the total to 300,000 yuan. In 1932, they began planning for the self-sufficiency of food raw materials, established a farm in Caohejing, and added a plum orchard in Chaoshan, Zhejiang. In 1934, the capital was increased by another 200,000 yuan, bringing the total to 500,000 yuan. That year, the total sales reached over 2.7 million yuan. Despite the economic downturn last year, there was still considerable progress in business."</p>
<p>The Caohejing farm that this reporter visited covers an area of ​​more than 40 mu, planted with many vegetables and fruits, to supply the restaurants of Guanshengyuan stores with ingredients for dishes. In the vacant spaces, pavilions were built, ponds were dug to draw in springs, and rocks were piled up to form mountains. A restaurant is located in the center of the farm, specially for those who come to the suburbs to breathe in the fresh air of nature and immerse themselves in the beautiful scenery, which invigorates the spirit and brings indescribable joy. Because it was winter, although it was a Sunday, there were only a few of us as visitors, and the quietness and desolation made it even more elegant and pleasant. A small part of the farm is designated as a goldfish garden, surrounded by bamboo fences. At the entrance, there is a horizontal plaque with the three characters "Fish Swim Heaven". Inside, there are ponds and fish tanks, holding thousands of goldfish of various sizes and colors. The rare and precious varieties are richly collected, reminiscent of visiting the Central Park and Tianqiao Goldfish Garden in Beiping, which is truly worth appreciating. The weather in the south is warmer, and in winter, the fish tanks can be exposed to sunlight without having to be moved indoors, saving a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>In the western part of the farm, there is a four-story building, which is the Guanshengyuan Caohejing Candy and Biscuit Factory. It occupies 60 square feet and is entirely built of cement and steel, with a three-dimensional shape and a magnificent appearance. Inside, the front of the first floor is the office, and the back is the boiler room. The second floor is the biscuit manufacturing department, the third floor is the packaging department, and the fourth floor is the candy department. All are powered by electricity, making it a modern factory. Male and female employees in each department were busy working, all wearing white cloth uniforms and white hats, clean and hygienic. The biscuit manufacturing department has several of the latest American-style baking ovens, each of which can produce more than 1,000 pounds of biscuits per hour. In addition, there are more than a dozen of the latest biscuit stamping machines, which can be used to make sweet, savory, and sandwich biscuits. The main parts of the machines are imported from Europe, and the auxiliary parts are made in Shanghai. After visiting each department, we rested in Wangmei Pavilion. The tea server brought strong tea, and everyone tasted the various freshly made biscuits, discussing the future development plans of the farm. Outside the window, we saw several plum trees with old trunks and graceful branches, their sparse shadows slanting across, making us feel relaxed and happy. After thanking the leader, our group reluctantly got into the car and returned.</p>

<p>Zhenru versus Haizhe, yesterday's match at the China venue was part of the Shanghai Basketball Association's Jiajia group competition. Despite the heavy snowfall, the audience was still very enthusiastic. The fierce battle lasted for forty minutes. Zhenru led throughout the first half, but after the restart, Haizhe's momentum became overwhelming. This side defended, showing extremely fierce competition and excellent performance, making it one of the most exciting scenes in the league. In the end, Haizhe narrowly escaped with a 42-41 victory. The battle situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Zhenru scores the first five points. When lining up for the jump ball, Haizhe's dangerous player, Lan Yin, was not on the court, and Bai Naite temporarily took his place. Before a single round, Kuang Yao Ya caught a pass from Cai Binxiong under the basket and scored. Afterwards, Han and Cai attacked from the front and rear, both scoring twice. In an instant, it was 10-0, briefly shining brightly.</p>
<p>Haizhe scores one point. The Haizhe team only scored one point with a free throw by Peer. Seeing the unfavorable situation, Lan Yin was brought in as a fresh force, and Bai Naite retired. Under the sharp offensive of Zhenru, there was still not much development. Yin, Han, Kuang, and Wang assisted, adding to the score. On the other side, Lan Yin also managed to score several times. By the end of the break, Zhenru was far ahead at 21-12.</p>
<p>Lan Yin achieves his wishes. Changing the defensive zone, the dispute started again. Haizhe greatly demonstrated its usual techniques of robbery and looting. In addition, the tall Lan Yin's jump balls went exactly where he wanted. No matter how capable our players were, they were no match for him. As a result, the forwards gained a great advantage. In an instant, Shi, Lan, and Peer scored seven goals by attacking from different directions, and the score rose to 26-21, taking the lead in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Both sides achieve a tie. Amidst the many difficulties, Zhenru changed its strategy and tried to counterattack. Wang Yong and Han scored three points with three shots, and the situation gradually turned around. Cai Yanxiong made a special achievement in the chaos, and then scored a long shot, creating a tie at 30.</p>
<p>Suffering a defeat by one point. Helplessly, the Haizhe team launched a comeback again. Shi, Lan, and Peer attacked from three directions, and Kalsen and Shi Guia intercepted from the front and rear. Zhenru's home was once again in turmoil. Then, Yin Guiren made a surprise attack, Nan Zhen lifted the moon under the basket, and Cai Yanxiong made three arrows from Tianshan, bringing the score to 39-41. Just as things were turning around, Cai unfortunately lost an opportunity, and Kalsen scored a point in return. Fortunately, Wang Nanzhen quickly retaliated, making it 42-41. Unfortunately, time ran out, and they suffered a defeat by one point.</p>
<p>In the B1 group, Youyou defeats Zhendan.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the fierce battle between Youyou and Zhendan, Youyou's battle situation was extremely smooth, scoring eight points in one go. However, Zhendan was unyielding and tried to counterattack, also showing some strength, taking the lead at 10-8. Afterwards, Youyou became even more courageous, and the score soared. Although Zhendan made repeated efforts, they were dwarfed by comparison. The result was 50-23, with Youyou winning.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Public Concession: This Year's Education Budget <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Before the Financial Situation Recovers</p>
<p>Various Expenses Must Still Be Reduced</p>
<p>The 1936 budget of the Education Department of the Public Concession's工部局, which was previously discussed at two meetings by the Education Committee on January 21st and 28th, was recommended to the Board of Directors. Subsequently, it was approved by the Board of Directors and submitted to the Finance Committee for review. We will now disclose its outline and key points.</p>
<p>In terms of temporary education expenses, there are two houses planned to be added for Western children, one is the cooking and needlework room for the Western Girls' School on Yuyuan Road, and the other is the auditorium for the Western Elementary School, as well as other minor reconstructions. The former originally planned to build a two-story building. The Director of Finance strongly stated that the current financial situation is extremely difficult, and these buildings, including the auditorium of the elementary school, should be postponed. However, the Chairman of the Education Committee insisted that the cooking room should not be delayed any longer. As a result, a compromise was reached, and it was proposed to allocate 25,000 yuan for the construction of the cooking room as a Class A urgent expense. As for the elementary school auditorium, it will not be discussed for the time being. However, to facilitate students placing their bicycles, a shed should be built immediately, with a cost ranging from 300 to 400 yuan. This item has also been included in the Class A urgent items.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Recurring Expenses: Chinese School Section <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>As for the recurring expenses for the Chinese children's school section, the student-teacher ratio at the Huishan Road East District Elementary School is not high. The Director of Finance asked whether there was any possibility of reducing the number of teachers. The Director of the Education Department stated that the number of students at the school had increased from 405 to 425 since the last report from the Director of Finance, and that the number of places was limited due to the small size of the classrooms. As far as the current situation is concerned, there is no possibility of reducing the number of staff. The school's budget was immediately passed as originally proposed.</p>
<p>The number of students at the Huade Road Elementary School has increased. According to the original proposal of the Director of Finance, it was proposed to transfer one teacher from the East District Elementary School to the school. However, since it is not possible to reduce the number of staff at the East District Elementary School for the time being, it will be necessary to hire another teacher. The school's original budget and the estimate for hiring another teacher were all passed.</p>
<p>The newly established Chinese Children's Half-Day School on Wenjian师路 was originally planned to open seven classes and hire twelve teachers. The Director of Finance felt that the number of teachers was not needed so many. The Chairman of the Education Committee immediately stated that the school is open for six full days a week, with a total of 350 students, divided into two classes in the morning and evening, each attending classes for three hours. Therefore, it is feared that the twelve teachers are already feeling very tired at work. The Director of the Education Department stated that the school has not yet opened, and 318 students have been enrolled. This is still in the trial phase, and it is difficult to predict how many teachers will be needed in the future. However, they will do their best to economize in the future.</p>
<p>The above budget items, together with the recurring expenses of the Education Department and the recurring expenses of other elementary schools and night schools, have been passed and submitted to the Finance Committee for review.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Chinese Children's Middle School Budget Passed <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The Singapore Road Girls' Middle School originally planned to hire four teachers this year, later changed to three, with one hired in January and two more hired in September in the autumn. However, the Finance Department strongly disagreed with this. A member of the Education Committee stated that the school has a definite income, so he believes that necessary expenses should not be withheld. The Chairman also said that since the number of students at the school has increased, it seems that there is no reason why teachers cannot be added. As a result, it was decided to add one teacher in the autumn, but it should be determined based on the situation at that time. After this case was revised, it was passed and recommended to the Board of Directors together with the recurring expenses budgets of other middle schools.</p>
<p>The工部局 established a normal school, which had previously been recommended to be discontinued by the Director of the Education Department. However, the school's expenses, totaling 2,900 yuan, were still included in the 1936 budget. Subsequently, the Chinese members of the Education Committee advocated using this expense to add a girls' night school in the East District. The Director of Finance stated that he did not oppose the proposal to add a girls' night school, but the expenses should not exceed the original 2,900 yuan for the normal school. As a result, it was decided to discontinue the normal school and use its expenses of 2,900 yuan to add a girls' night school.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Situation of Western Schools' Budgets <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>According to the original plan of the Western Elementary School, it was planned to hire one teacher in the spring and autumn seasons this year. Later, the principal of the school suggested that since the increase in the number of students in the spring season was not very large, only one teacher should be hired in the autumn. According to the Director of Finance, the teacher hired in the autumn was also not needed. The Director of the Education Department said that if the number of students increased sharply in the autumn, they would have to reject new students if they did not add teachers. As a result, it was decided that if the number of students increased in the autumn of this year, a first-grade teaching assistant should be hired from September 1st, and the expenses should be included in the budget in advance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Director of Finance expressed his dissatisfaction with the number of students in other Western schools in his report, saying that the current ratio of students to education units is only 21 students per unit. If this does not increase for a long time, the number of teachers should be reduced immediately, or no substitute teachers should be hired during the long vacations that teachers are entitled to. After deliberation by the Education Committee, it was decided that the Director of the Education Department should prepare a report on this matter and submit it to the committee for review.</p>
<p>The above education budgets, except for those that still need to be reviewed by the Finance Department, have been passed and submitted to the Finance Committee for review.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Youth Education Issues a Declaration (1) <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The Youth Education Society of this city issued the following declaration on the construction of Chinese youth education:</p>
<p>The 20th century is the Pacific era, the 20th century is the time for the liberation of the oppressed peoples along the Pacific coast, the 20th century is the era of China's liberation. World capitalism and imperialism have reached their final stage, and their struggle before their decline and destruction is the division of the world's semi-colonies and the re-division of colonies. This will inevitably lead to mutual slaughter within the imperialist camp and the united resistance of the peoples of colonies and semi-colonies. The result of this slaughter and resistance will be the liberation of the oppressed human beings of the world. The liberation movement of the oppressed peoples of the Pacific is based on the revolutionary movement of the Chinese Kuomintang in China and takes the completion of the Chinese revolution as a condition for success. At present, the Chinese revolution has not yet been completed and can only provide constant stimulation to the oppressed peoples along the Pacific coast. In the present state of the incomplete Chinese revolution, the imperialists have begun to carve up China. This is the inevitable means by which the imperialists suppress the resistance of the colonial peoples and divide the semi-colonies to maintain their survival. It is also a counter-evidence that the imperialists are on the verge of death. Only when the entire Chinese people are oppressed to the point of having no way out will a great war of resistance erupt. We must certainly wait quietly for the arrival of the opportunity, but we must also fully cultivate the strength to fight. The Chinese revolution has the principles personally determined by Sun Yat-sen, the policies adapted to the times by President Chiang, and a certain pace. The imperialists' acts of aggression in China are sufficient to strengthen our revolutionary actions and awaken the revolutionary national soul of China. The Central Government, at the present stage of completing the suppression of the communists, has begun to move towards the path of revolutionary construction. The Central Government, after the Fifth National Congress, has decided on the revolutionary strategy for the current stage. We cannot disrupt the pace of the revolution because of the invasion and division of the territory. We must intensify the construction of the revolution because of the invasion and division of the territory. When the construction of the revolution is completed, it will be the time when the country and the nation are liberated. The Central Government is the leading organ of revolutionary work. The cultivation of revolutionary strength still requires the awakening and soundness of the national masses. The revolutionary strength generated by the awakened and sound masses of the Central Government can lead the complete Chinese revolution. Therefore, at the time of his death, Sun Yat-sen earnestly urged the awakening of the masses, and President Chiang often taught the sacrifice of individuals for the sake of society and the country. The revolutionary camp is based on the entire masses and centered on the youth of the country. The completion of the Northern Expedition in 1927 gave us a great lesson: the revolution of the entire people should be led by the youth, and the revolutionary work initiated by the youth will enable the ignorant or semi-ignorant masses to form a united battlefront, and the revolutionary work initiated by the youth will be completed.

<p>Chapter Nine: Human Legacy of Love</p>
<p>"Wake up, Demi, dear! I want you to come."</p>
<p>"Oh, I just got to bed; it isn't daylight yet," said Demi, waking from his first sound sleep and blinking like a little owl.</p>
<p>"It's only ten o'clock, but your father is ill, and we must go to see him. Oh, my poor Joanie, my poor Paine," sighed Aunt Meg, bending over his pillow as she spoke. Demi, who was still sleepy, suddenly woke up, his heart filled with fear and surprise. He vaguely felt why Aunt Meg called him "Joanie" and cried for him, as if some misfortune had befallen him. He only clung to her, not saying a word. Soon she calmed down, saw his dejected face, gave him a loving kiss, and said:</p>
<p>"We must go and say good-bye to him, my dear, and without delay. So dress quickly, and come to my room."</p>
<p>"Yes, I will," Demi said. After Aunt Meg left, Demi quietly got up, dressed, still not knowing if he was awake or dreaming. Seeing Tommy still fast asleep, he didn't wake him. He just passed through the silent house, feeling that a sad and unprecedented thing was about to happen—this thing temporarily separated him from the other children, making the world seem dark, lonely, and strange, just like those rooms at night. Mr. Laurie's carriage was parked at the door. Little May was also ready in a moment. The brother and sister, guarded by their aunt and uncle, held hands all the way, sitting in the car, swiftly and silently passing through many shadowy roads, straight to the town to bid farewell to their father forever.</p>

<p>The gold market yesterday was slightly weaker than stable, mainly because although the price of silver rose, the Central Bank's customs duties were high. The market could still support it. Later, Sassoon sold sterling, and the Indian silver report lengthened, and the trend was slightly weaker. In the early morning, overseas silver markets saw London rise and the US remain unchanged. After the close of the day, near and forward prices were both high at .0625, and there was no news of sellers. The forward silver price in Monterey lengthened by 2.5 percent, ranging from 53 percent. The exchange rate slightly shrank. The price of raw gold in London rose by one penny. The Central Bank's listing was announced, and both the UK and the US were unchanged.

After the opening, the banks were still pushing up, rising after the initial low, but the market was already very mediocre. The HSBC listing was announced, and both the UK and the US were unchanged. The fluctuations were very narrow. After entering the market, there were more sellers, and the market gradually went downstream. However, the market still fluctuated because the silver equalization tax was announced to remain unchanged. However, due to oversupply, the situation was still weak. Buyers took advantage of the low price to move, gradually pulling up. The domestic market was peaceful, and the trend was stable at noon. In the afternoon, the market was still stable, but Sassoon and other Western merchants came to sell sterling, which boosted the selling pressure and made it difficult to support, and gradually went downstream. The midterm consolidation was limited, and the transaction volume was even smaller. The banks slightly sold sterling. The initial Indian silver report lengthened by eight annas, and the selling pressure was still strong. Large short sellers took the opportunity to suppress the market, and it fell once, but there was a slight maintainance after the low. In the end, the overall trend was mediocre.

<p>Due to the severe cold and thick ice at Dagukou, Tianjin, ships carrying red and black dates are unable to arrive, leading to a shortage of goods on the market.

<p>The sales of woolen fabrics have been quite brisk recently. The purchasing power from various regions is strong. Merchants from Sichuan, Jiangxi, the capital, Changsha, and other ports are continuing to replenish their stocks, either by personally coming to Shanghai for procurement or by ordering through express mail. There are several such transactions daily, with Japanese goods being particularly favored. The reason is that buyers often find Western goods too expensive and the styles outdated. As a result, Japanese woolen fabrics now hold a considerable market share, and there is concern that Western woolen fabrics may be displaced. Yesterday, the sales of lightweight woolen fabrics and plain serge from various firms amounted to over six thousand yards. The transaction price for 160-count lightweight spring woolen fabric was three yuan and two jiao per yard, first-grade at three yuan and four and a half jiao, second-grade at two yuan and seven and a half jiao.

<p>The China Cotton Improvement Association, noting that the United States, India, Egypt, and other countries have long had cotton seed laws, and that domestic cotton production has developed significantly in recent years, believes that it is essential to implement a cotton seed law to enhance and improve the effectiveness of cotton production. Therefore, at its third annual general meeting on December 28, 1934, it was decided to "draft a cotton seed law and implementation regulations and submit them to the central government for adoption and implementation." Wang Yao-chen, Feng Zhao-chuan, Feng Ze-fang, Hao Qin-ming, and Jiang Di-xian were elected as drafting committee members, with Hao Qin-ming leading the drafting process. Over the past year, based on the domestic cotton production situation and with reference to the laws of the United States, India, and Egypt, a draft cotton seed law consisting of twenty-four articles and implementation regulations consisting of thirteen articles have been prepared. These were then submitted to the fourth annual meeting on January 5, 1936, for discussion. It was generally agreed that these laws are unprecedented in China and that opinions should be solicited from all over the country to ensure their perfection. It was decided to publish the draft first and solicit opinions from all parties within three months. The drafting committee will then revise the draft based on the feedback, and the executive committee will decide whether to submit it to the central government. The draft cotton seed law and implementation regulations are recorded below. If you have any opinions, please send them to the China Cotton Improvement Association at No. 260, Avenue Edward VII, Shanghai, before the end of April.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Dedicated to the Newlywed Housewife <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— He Gui</p>
<p>Ladies, time flies so quickly. Before you know it, you've left your original family and become the mistress of another. This new family is indeed the haven you've always dreamed of. However, as you embark on your journey as a new housewife, you're bound to encounter countless challenges. You wonder how to maintain lasting love with your husband and how to manage this newly established household. Even minor issues can bring you to tears. Perhaps you'll even start to resent the troubles and hardships of marriage!</p>
<p>Ladies, you must remember that your own mother went through similar difficulties when she first became a housewife. But she persevered and raised you and your siblings. She then passed on the responsibility of being a housewife, a duty that every woman must inevitably shoulder, to you. She is your best role model. You should strive to emulate her virtues. Naturally, she may have made mistakes along the way. Consider those missteps as valuable lessons and avoid repeating them in your own new family.</p>
<p>For instance, you may be concerned about how to maintain lasting love between husband and wife. This isn't as difficult as it seems. Aside from mutual tolerance and understanding, the most crucial factor is realizing that your love isn't built on material wealth. Your parents may have occasionally quarreled, and most of their disagreements likely stemmed from financial matters. Countless happy couples have suffered irreparable damage due to disputes over money. You must avoid making the same mistakes. If your husband's income is modest and he can't afford to dress you in finery or provide lavish meals, you might feel inadequate when you see classmates and friends with more material possessions. You might blame your husband for being incompetent, lament your fate, or even be tempted to be unfaithful to your husband to satisfy your material desires. On the other hand, if your husband is wealthy and provides you with a life of luxury, you might feel like you're in paradise. But indulging in endless wants and desires will ultimately bring you no benefit. Aren't those who live solely for material possessions considered "walking corpses?"</p>
<p>Think about the great women in history. Were they frugal or extravagant? As educated women, you surely know many examples. Yang Guifei and Empress Dowager Cixi have been dead for years, but people still criticize them. You also know the story of Liang Hong and Meng Guang, a couple who lived a simple life but were praised by later generations for their virtue.</p>
<p>So, you see, whether your husband is rich or poor, you must break free from the "demon" of material desires to maintain lasting love between you and your husband.</p>
<p>If these words have struck a nerve, then I hope you will quickly change your ways. Happiness can still be yours. Otherwise, you will face great suffering in this life. Regardless of your family's circumstances, both you and your husband must strive to move forward. Don't stagnate for the sake of momentary comfort. You should also constantly encourage your husband to advance, and your love will grow stronger each day, filling your new family with joy and happiness.</p>

<p>— Xi Qian</p>
<p>——Mrs. Zou Yixin of China——</p>
<p>In our country, which lags behind in every aspect, various sciences naturally fall behind those of other nations. Japan, as a rising nation, is always competing with European and American countries in everything. However, it has yet to produce a female astronomer, leaving Mrs. Zou Yixin of China to excel in this field and bring honor to China's new women. The following is a brief account of the Japanese people's praise for Ms. Zou, for the benefit of our readers.</p>
<p>This year, the Japanese astronomical community is welcoming a distinguished guest from China because of the numerous opportunities to observe solar eclipses. She is Zou Yixin, a technician at the National Central University Observatory in Nanjing. There are no aspiring female astronomers in Japan, so Mrs. Zou will be the only female astronomer in the Orient. She received her education at Central University and then became a technician at her alma mater's observatory, where she frequently publishes papers. Because China's astronomical observation equipment is not complete, she came to Japan for further study. Through the mediation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education, she will be a guest at the Tokyo Astronomical Observatory in Mitaka Village, Tokyo Prefecture, starting in mid-March of this year. There are five or six Chinese students studying astronomy in Japan, but only Mr. Shen and Mr. Xu have graduated from the astronomy department. Mr. Shen and others have gone to Germany and have earned considerable reputation. These are all men and they studied in Japan. Now, Mrs. Zou has come to Japan for practical training after studying astronomy in her own country, which is even more valuable. Mrs. Zou is the first female astronomer in the Orient.</p>
<p>How pitiful are those women who only know how to apply rouge and powder to their faces, but don't understand the prices of firewood, rice, oil, and salt!</p>
<p>—Special Feature of this Newspaper</p>
<h3 id="e201">Mrs. Tai Shuangqiu, Ms. Huang Jima, Discusses Home Economics Education <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Home economics education is such an important subject, especially in this era of prevalent modern family systems. Encouraged by this thought, I made a special trip to visit Ms. Huang Jima, who is not only a pioneer in social service but also a virtuous wife and mother of the new era. Dr. Tai used to teach at various universities in Guangdong and Henan, and she accompanied him to serve there as well. Later, when he became the dean of the College of Education at Great China University, she also served as a lecturer at Great China. She also provided a lot of assistance to his founding of the "Educational Compilation and Translation Bureau," his launch of the "Twenty-Two Society Movement," and his invention of the "Shuangqiu Alphabet and Educational Vehicle." Wouldn't you say that such a capable wife is worth emulating by women in general? The following is a fragmented record of our conversation at the time:</p>
<p>The Motivation for Studying Medicine</p>
<p>Mrs. Tai said: "Mr. Tai and I were classmates at National Southeast University. He was a year ahead of me. I studied foreign literature, and he studied education. Later, when he went to study in the United States, I felt that foreign languages were not practical, so I transferred to Peking Union Medical College, thinking that I could become a doctor if I advanced, or guide general family health issues if I retreated. However, my constitution was too weak, and I couldn't endure the hard work, so I returned to Southeast University to graduate. When I arrived in Shanghai, I suddenly wanted to continue studying medicine. Coincidentally, West Gate had just founded a women's medical university, so I studied for another two years, completed the required credits, and had a basic understanding of medicine. At this time, Mr. Tai returned to China and did not approve of my pursuit of medicine. He wanted me to serve education alongside him. In fact, learning specialized skills can also contribute to education. This is what I like, and I don't want to violate my own aspirations."</p>
<p>The Contribution of Home Economics Education</p>
<p>After we formed our family, we implemented our predetermined plan and devoted ourselves to education. Three years ago, when we were at Henan University, the provincial women's normal school hired me to teach home economics. I felt that the women in the Northwest were very simple, hardworking, and tolerant. The original home economics course only taught common sense such as cooking and sewing, which was certainly not enough. So, I decided to expand the scope and compile my own lecture notes, focusing on: Family health—such as physical protection, health checkups, prevention of infectious diseases, first aid and nursing for common illnesses, and home medicine equipment; Women's childbirth—such as prenatal and postnatal hygiene, infant care, the development of infants' living habits, and the handling of illnesses; Family education—such as child psychology, children's behavior, and guidance in intellectual, moral, and physical aspects; Family economy—such as budgeting and final accounting, savings and insurance, and household bookkeeping; Family social activities... I explained these essential knowledge for women in detail, classified by categories. The students were very interested and tasted them. After teaching for a year and a half, I asked them if they had learned these theories before. Everyone said no. I said that all of you will be housewives in the future, so this kind of knowledge must be applied in practice. I think that a woman who does not understand home economics is not worthy of being a housewife; let alone building a new family and reforming a corrupt society. Just talking about serving the society is also very vague. Returning to Shanghai in recent years, I have been serving in the home economics department at Daxia University, reorganizing the previous purchases and publishing two books: one is "Practical Home Economics" and the other is "Home Affairs", wanting to instill home economics into forward-thinking women.</p>
<p>My Opinion on Women's Service</p>
<p>I believe that modern women who only stay at home as housewives cannot give full play to their abilities and do social undertakings that are beneficial to the public. It is too narrow. On the other hand, only serving the society and despising home affairs is not the happiness of the family. In fact, there should be no obvious distinction between family service and social service. These two aspects should be integrated, because social service can be said to be indirectly serving other people's families, while family service is directly serving one's own family. So, I advocate that a woman should recognize that in family service, she should also engage in social service undertakings. Nowadays, some urban women do not go out, and some spend their days in recreation, and there are very few proper contacts between women. I want to organize a club that meets once a week for a decision, has proper entertainment, and has public lectures where knowledge can be exchanged and issues of interest to oneself can be studied. No matter what kind of knowledge, if one person understands it, the benefits are limited, but if the public knows it, the results will be huge; if you want every family to be happy, you can't do without this kind of common gathering.</p>
<p>The Tai Family</p>
<p>Their family is also worth emulating. Mr. Tai is almost out serving all day long, and Mrs. Tai presides over the household affairs. They have no improper habits such as smoking, drinking, or gambling, and devote themselves to books, newspapers, writings, and sports. It is said that the household expenses are more economical than ordinary middle-class families. Babies in other families eat milk, chicken juice, and tonics, while their children only drink soy milk and rice soup. This is the idea of Mr. and Mrs. Tai. From this point alone, you can get a general idea of the rest. Mr. Tai's diligent and thrifty spirit is equal to that of an old farmer in the countryside. He wears cotton clothes all over his body, and each piece of clothing costs no more than three or four yuan. This leader of the frugal movement can indeed speak and act, unlike ordinary people who love to be leaders, with mouths full of benevolence, righteousness, and morality, but their hearts are not worth mentioning. I saw the couplet written by Mr. Han Guojun in the hall of the department:</p>
<p>Ten thousand volumes in the chest can support the hungry world, not a speck of dust reaches the door.</p>
<p>After careful reflection, I felt that it was most appropriate to describe the character of Mr. and Mrs. Tai with this couplet.</p>
<h3 id="e202">(Mrs. Tai and Her Beloved Daughter) <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<h3 id="e203">Japanese Female Writers in the Past Year (Japan Communication) <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Man Zhi</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the status of Japanese women in society is very low, but they have a high level of performance in literature. Summing up the works published in various magazines in the past year, whether in terms of quantity or quality, there are considerable achievements.</p>
<p>How many female writers have expressed their works in the past year? According to the customary division, they can be roughly divided into two major schools: bourgeois literature and proletarian literature. The authors of bourgeois literature include Nogami Yaeko, Uno Chiyo, Hayashi Fumiko, Okada Teiko, Enchi Fumiko, Mikawa Yoko, Nakamachi Teiko, Tomimoto Yoko, Yada Tsuseko, etc. Proletarian writers include Nakajo Yuriko, Hirabayashi Taiko, Kubokawa Ineko, Hirabayashi Hideko, Matsuda Tokiko, Otani Fujiko, and new writer Asai Hanako, etc. However, even among bourgeois writers, works such as Nogami Yaeko's "Poor Boy" cannot be classified in the same category as Uno Chiyo and Hayashi Fumiko's works. "Poor Boy" is full of positive liberal ideas and expresses extreme resistance to modern Japanese society. Okada Teiko, Enchi Fumiko, Tomimoto Yoko, and others' works also strongly carry this color, which is rarely seen in the works of bourgeois male writers. It can be said that Japanese female writers' liberalism preserves its purity more than male writers.</p>
<p>In addition to "Poor Boy," Nogami Yaeko also wrote "Little Devil's Song," which was based on the riots at Hosei University and used her husband as one of the central figures in the novel. Many criticisms have said that her observation of the people around her is not thorough. "Poor Boy" describes a young boy's heart being hurt by military training. It is an enlightenment work.</p>
<p>Uno Chiyo's "Eroticism," "Me and the Child," "Joy of Separation," "Women's Lives," "Prostitute's Letter," etc., mostly depict the erotic world.</p>
<p>Hayashi Fumiko wrote "Foggy Days," "Clara," "Life Rhapsody," "Hen," "Grape Bank," "Oyster," etc. In "Oyster" and "Foggy Days," it can be seen that the author is trying to transition from lyricalism to observational literature, especially "Oyster," which has received good reviews from the literary world.</p>
<p>Okada Teiko wrote the drama "Miss Xu Xu Aisha," which satirizes the issue of a certain lady preparing to be betrothed to the Emperor of Abyssinia as a royal sword. Enchi Fumiko also published dramas, such as "Forgery Incident," etc.</p>
<p>Among the proletarian faction, Nakajo Yuriko is the most prominent. In the past year, she wrote "Breast" and "Breakwater," and then fell into a situation where she could not write. "Breakwater" was also written during her life as a prisoner. "Breast" has received very good reviews in many criticisms. Mitsuharu Serizawa said that it is a good work that combines daily life and history.</p>
<p>Hirabayashi Taiko is the most prolific writer in the proletarian faction in the past year, writing "Sakura," "A Material on the Theory of the Intellectual Class," "Octopus," "Saturday Night," "Women's Problems," etc. "Sakura" is a satirical work. "A Material on the Theory of the Intellectual Class" is a typical work that critically depicts the intellectual class because of the lively discussions about the intellectual class in the Japanese forum in the past year. "Octopus" is a work depicting unstable figures in the laboring class. What is particularly noteworthy is "Women's Problems," which is a work that raises questions from the perspective of women about the liberal views of men and women who take women's economic independence and gender equality as their motto. In general, her works in the past year have been mainly social criticism.</p>
<p>Kubokawa Ineko wrote "A Bag of Coarse Snacks," "Among the Iron Filings," "Along the Way," etc. "A Bag of Coarse Snacks" is praised for being full of female psychology. "Along the Way" is a female worker's recollection of her girlhood. Matsuda Tokiko serialized the long novel "Villager" in "Women's Literature and Art."</p>
<p>Hirabayashi Hideko's "A Typical Example" and "Daily Affairs" are all based on her own personal experiences. Fujishima Maki published the long novel "In Insult" in "Literary Criticism." New writer Asai Hanako also wrote "Muddy Spring." Otani Fujiko published "Susakiya," "Mother's Letter," and "Blood Relationship," etc. In addition, new writers and their works include Uchiyama Ikuko's "Assistant" and Togawa Shizuko's Death and Life.</p>
<p>From the above description, it can be seen that Japanese female writers are active. But looking at our China, the literary activities of women in the past year have completely declined. Not only have no new female writers appeared, but even the established female writers have not developed, and there are no women engaged in literature. In this state, how should we strive to express women's creativity in literature!</p>
<h3 id="e204">Two Major Camps on Women's Issues <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Yazi</p>
<p>Regarding women's issues, there are recently two major camps. On the one hand, it is said that men are human beings, and women are also human beings, so men and women should not be distinguished by gender, and should strive for the entire human race with the qualifications of human beings. On the other hand, they want to call women back to the kitchen and into the home, making cakes and puddings, and holding children, which is considered to be their natural duty, and is beautifully named the theory of virtuous mothers and good wives, or the new theory of virtuous mothers and good wives. Between these two, I agree with the former proposition. Virtuous mothers and good wives certainly sound good. Who would advocate that women should be unvirtuous mothers and wives? However, in the same proportion, men should be virtuous fathers and good husbands, which is always the great righteousness that cannot be escaped between heaven and earth. However, why not advocate virtuous fathers and good husbands? However, men have responsibilities beyond fathers and husbands; then, don't women have responsibilities beyond mothers and wives? My proposition is that in the future Datong world, there will be free love and public childcare, and even the names of parents, wives, and children will be gone, and of course there will be no virtuousness. In the present, the duties of fathers and husbands should be opposed to those of mothers and wives. Since no one has been heard to advocate virtuous fathers and good husbands, advocating virtuous mothers and good wives is always superfluous.</p>
<p>The tone of "Women's Life" belongs to the former. It can get rid of the clichéd virtuous mother and good wife, and advocates that women should strive for the entire nation, and even more for the entire human race. This proposition, I think, is worth supporting and worth introducing.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: This magazine has no preconceptions about women's issues, whether it is to enter society or the kitchen; we welcome articles on both sides of this debate.</p>
<h3 id="e205">The Economic Problems of Small Families <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Qian Zhiting</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Yutang said that women take marriage as their only profession. Indeed, for the sake of maintaining social order and for personal happiness, one cannot hold onto celibacy for too long. In the spring of last year, Zhiting was introduced by a friend and married Yun Jun, forming a couple from friendship. Yun Jun is gentle and sincere, and Zhiting is also steadfast and self-respecting, and dare not get involved in the romantic habits of the time. In terms of spirit, the life of a small family is harmonious. But economically, I deeply feel that it is not easy to live in Shanghai. Even if we are extremely frugal in food, clothing, housing, and transportation, we still have difficulty making ends meet. Yun Jun teaches in an elementary school and earns a monthly salary of twenty yuan, which is not enough to cover the living expenses of two people. Although Zhiting is determined to engage in a career, in this recessionary era, even men feel it is difficult to find a job. Where can Zhiting, a weak woman, find a way out? Therefore, she worries day and night and has no solution. Just seeing the solicitation of articles in the Women's Special of this newspaper, without considering my shallow knowledge, I specially raise this "economic problem of small families", and hope that home economists will design it. Although many publications have already published about the new family organization, they all belong to the aristocracy, and we commoners can only sigh with hope. Therefore, what I hope from home economists is that they can talk about home economics from the standpoint of the public, and not just talk about theory. As for this article, I have no contribution at first, but I aim to attract jade from bricks, and I want to solicit opinions that are beneficial to the economy of small families.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Reproductive Maturity <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Erchang</p>
<p>Reproductive maturity (Gesschechtsreife) refers to the completion of general reproductive organs and the ability to perform complete reproductive functions, which usually occurs during the onset of puberty. At this stage, men grow beards and their voices deepen, their muscles and bones become stronger. In women, their breasts become fuller, menstruation begins, their pelvises widen, and their skin becomes richer in sebum, forming the physique unique to women. If their reproductive glands are weak, men will suffer from premature ejaculation, impotence, spermatorrhea, and other symptoms. Women will suffer from amenorrhea, irregular periods, uterine cold, leucorrhea, and other symptoms. Each must be treated with endocrine preparations for male and female reproductive glands to restore their reproductive function. If the body is weak, it is not suitable for marriage. Even after marriage, there is no hope of offspring. It is for this reason that some people have been married for a long time and suffer from infertility.</p>

<p>Pay Attention to Her Medication</p>
<p>(Report by Dr. Ren Guoxiang) Patient: Mrs. Su Houde, age 37. Married for sixteen years. Due to frequent menstrual irregularities and persistent leucorrhea, she had not been able to conceive. Her health had deteriorated, leaving her thin and frail, with numerous signs of weakness. She was afraid of movement and averse to labor, appearing as if she were forty-five or forty-six years old. Last year, Mr. Su, desiring an heir, was eager to take a concubine. Mrs. Su then pleaded with Mrs. Zhu Shurong to introduce her to me for treatment. (Note: Mrs. Wang had previously suffered from similar ailments and was cured by me.) I instructed her to purchase "Female Reproductive Essence" from Huamei Pharmacy and to use "Leucorrhea Remedy" externally, following the instructions for self-treatment at home. After two follow-up visits, the leucorrhea gradually cleared. Within a month, the leucorrhea was gone, and her menstruation regulated. She regained her youth, her muscles filled out, and her breasts became firm. By autumn, Mrs. Su introduced her friend to quit smoking. I noticed her abdomen was swollen. Upon inquiring about her condition, I learned that Mrs. Su had been pregnant for four or five months.</p>

<p>— Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission is a condition that affects many young people in the city. Semen is the most precious substance in the human body, even more valuable than blood. If it is constantly discharged, not only will health disappear and diseases arise, but also the hope of offspring will vanish. A premature and tragic death is inevitable. The method of treatment, in addition to using astringent agents to strengthen the seminal gate, is also to nourish the reproductive glands. Otherwise, it is not a radical cure.</p>

<p>(Report by Dr. Yu Bofu) Patient: Hao Guoxun, age 22. Formerly engaged in masturbation. Has quit in recent years. However, because his reproductive glands have been damaged, he suffers from nocturnal emission, insomnia, and other symptoms. He has taken various medications, but none have provided a radical cure. Last autumn, he came to me for treatment. I instructed him to purchase "Reproductive Essence" and firming pills with the "Hymeltos" mark from Taihe Pharmacy and take them regularly. After taking several boxes, the nocturnal emission ceased, his mind became clear, he slept soundly at night, his weight increased, and he became stronger than ever.</p>

<p>— (Manuscript by Hu Shanxing)</p>
<p>My wife and I were on the black list a month ago. Now we have finally escaped the sea of suffering. The reason we became addicted to smoking was that I suffered from premature ejaculation and my wife suffered from stomach pain. We sought various treatments, but none were able to eradicate the problem. We were in so much pain that we had no choice but to listen to relatives and try smoking opium. At first, it seemed to boost our spirits and numb the pain. Over time, we became addicted, but the disease remained incurable. Moreover, the smoking addiction became a serious problem. We tried to quit several times, but the pain prevented us from succeeding. Two months ago, after reading this publication, we learned that "Reproductive Essence" had the miraculous effect of quitting smoking and eliminating venereal diseases. We immediately wrote to this publication to inquire about its use. We were instructed to take "Male" and "Female" Reproductive Essence separately and were introduced to "Stomach Pain Remedy" to radically cure stomach problems and "Stomach Strengthening Essence" to nourish the stomach. We followed the instructions and took the medications ourselves. After about a month, the pain disappeared and the smoking addiction was eliminated. Now the husband is strong, the wife is healthy, and we are infinitely happy. Recalling the merits of this treatment, I write this to express my gratitude and to recommend it to others.</p>

<p>— Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Those who engage in masturbation or excessive sexual activity damage their reproductive glands, leading to decline. Impotence and premature ejaculation become unavoidable. Those who suffer from the above-mentioned sexual diseases not only disrupt their lives but also lose their health. Symptoms of weakness arise repeatedly. The method of treatment, in addition to undergoing electrotherapy by a well-known sexual disease physician, is to take reproductive gland preparations internally if medical treatment is inconvenient. This will restore the reproductive glands to prosperity, eliminate the ailments, and restore health.</p>

<p>— (Manuscript by Bian Zhongsheng)</p>
<p>Because I was ignorant of the way to maintain my health, my sexual function was damaged, and I suffered from impotence, premature ejaculation, and other symptoms. Treatment was ineffective, and various complications arose. (Omitted) Last autumn, a close friend, Mr. Chen, introduced me to the sexual disease expert Dr. Zhan Nianzeng for treatment. He used electrotherapy and "Reproductive Essence," which restored my sexual function and health. Because of the miraculous efficacy of "Reproductive Essence," I have recommended it to friends suffering from sexual diseases, and they have also been treated. Ah, "Reproductive Essence" is indeed a great savior for patients with sexual diseases.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Treatment Methods for Stomach Weakness and Loss of Appetite <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>To have a healthy body, one must first have a healthy stomach. It is generally known that reproductive gland preparations can be used to reverse weakness and strengthen the body. But what method should be used to treat those who suffer from stomach weakness and loss of appetite, leading to poor digestion?</p>
<p>To strengthen the stomach, one must first understand its physiology. Digestion of food in the stomach depends entirely on sufficient gastric juice. If gastric juice is lacking, it will lead to stomach weakness, loss of appetite, and various other complications. Therefore, gastric juice preparations are truly the treasures of stomach strengthening. All those suffering from stomach weakness and loss of appetite must know this.</p>
<p>"Stomach Strengthening Essence" Dosage: Two tablets three times a day, swallowed with warm water after meals. It is most effective for treating stomach weakness and loss of appetite. For those suffering from gastritis, stomach pain, stomach upset, heartburn, and other symptoms, "Stomach Pain Remedy" must be taken at the same time to eradicate the root cause of the disease.</p>

<p>(1) Premature Ejaculation and Amenorrhea Treated Together in Husband and Wife</p>
<p>Patient: Zhang Zuyao, local resident. Before marriage, Mr. Zhang indulged in social engagements and was captivated by pleasure, working day and night, exhausting his mind and body. His sexual function was severely damaged, leading to premature ejaculation and impotence. Last spring, I performed electrotherapy on him and instructed him to purchase "Reproductive Essence" from Zhongxi Pharmacy. He was cured instantly. The following month, Mr. Zhang came with his wife, seeking treatment for her amenorrhea and persistent leucorrhea. I instructed her to take "Female Reproductive Essence" internally and purchase "Leucorrhea Remedy" for external use at home. Within three or four days, a large amount of leucorrhea was discharged. From the fifth day onwards, the leucorrhea gradually cleared. Before long, her menstruation also returned and was very normal. Husband and wife both regained their health. Before long, Mr. Zhang sent a letter of thanks, saying that his wife had given birth to a son. After many years of marriage without offspring, they have now obtained an heir, all thanks to the rich experience of the esteemed doctor and the appropriate use of medication.</p>
<p>(2) Nocturnal Emission and Insomnia Cured in a Month</p>
<p>Patient: Shen Zhihua, age 27, from Zhejiang. Academic. In his early years, Mr. Shen was lured by bad friends and mistakenly engaged in the bad habit of masturbation, weakening his body. Later, because his body deteriorated, he began to notice the harm and quit. However, because his reproductive glands had atrophied, he suffered from nocturnal emission. At first, it occurred several times a month, then more than once every ten days. He sought medical treatment and took medication, but the results were lacking. He suffered from insomnia and forgetfulness, which were very distressing. It was not until last autumn that he came to me for treatment. I used the latest scientific surgical radio wave therapy and instructed him to purchase "Reproductive Essence" and firming pills with the "Hymeltos" mark from Huamei Pharmacy and take them together. Within a month, the nocturnal emission was cured, and his body quickly regained its strength. His muscles filled out, his weight increased, his spirits were refreshed, and he regained his youth. He said that his development was so perfect that it was unprecedented in his life.</p>

<p>Kidney Atrophy Saved</p>
<p>Patient: Guo Jiping, age 32, from Henan. Businessman. Mr. Guo masturbated as a child and engaged in excessive sexual activity after marriage, leading to atrophy of the reproductive glands. He suffered from impotence. Although over thirty, his male organ remained small like a child's. He failed in his husbandly duties and was greatly ridiculed by his wife. He suffered mentally and physically. Symptoms of weakness frequently appeared. Not only did he experience dizziness, blurred vision, tinnitus, and brain swelling, but also palpitations, night sweats, back pain, and various other symptoms. He was in great distress. He sought medical treatment and took various medications, but the results were difficult to determine. It was not until last autumn that he was introduced to me by a close relative for treatment. I found that his reproductive glands were abnormally atrophied and instructed him to purchase "Reproductive Essence" from Zhongying Pharmacy and take it. After taking it, the effects were significant. I instructed him to continue taking several boxes with peace of mind. The kidney atrophy was cured, all symptoms disappeared, and his body regained its health. The husband and wife's affection was better than that of a newlywed couple.</p>
<p>Treatment of Nocturnal Emission</p>
<p>Patient: Zuo Guanrun, age 24, local resident. Works at a foreign firm. Mr. Zuo was poisoned by obscene books in the past and mistakenly engaged in the bad habit of self-gratification, weakening his body. At first, he relied on his good health and did not care. Later, because his body gradually deteriorated and symptoms of weakness repeatedly appeared, he began to notice the harm and quit. However, he had already suffered from nocturnal emission. With or without dreams, semen was discharged while he was in a daze. His body was thin and his spirits were low. It was not until last autumn that he came to me for treatment. I instructed him to purchase "Reproductive Essence" and "Hymeltos Firming Pills" from the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company and take them together according to the instructions. The nocturnal emission was cured immediately, and the symptoms of weakness gradually disappeared. After about four weeks, there was no further nocturnal emission. He gratefully thanked me and left.</p>

<h3 id="e219">The Movement to Liberate婢女 <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Jianping</p>
<p>This newspaper listed on the 5th: the local Public Security Bureau decided to implement registration starting in March, stating that "liberating homeless女子 who are alone and helpless is extremely related to international reputation and humanitarian laws," and allow for "unconditional release" of婢女 to "restore freedom." This news can be considered worthy of a raised voice. Although in principle, it is only superficially for the sake of "international reputation," for the sake of "humanitarian laws," and not caring about the "homeless女子" being abused, but seeking a way out, the decisive disposal of their methods is also a commendable merit.</p>
<p>Now, what needs to be specially brought up for discussion are items 2, 3, and 4 in the "registration method" regarding the way out for婢女 after liberation.</p>
<p>Article 2 states: "If they are minors and have no home to return to, or if they return home but cannot afford to support themselves, they should be sent to the municipal welfare home or other charitable organizations for placement." This is almost the same meaning as item 4, "婢女 who have been liberated but have no family members or the location of family members is unknown may select the head of a local welfare home or other charitable organization as their guardian." It is very clearly "humanitarian" to unconditionally pity and "guard" the婢女. In principle, this can be said to be appropriate, but we can say that it is not thorough. Because the true freedom that a person needs is to have true skills to support themselves, not to need anyone to rely on. Although perhaps the welfare home has ways to teach the婢女 skills, the way out for the welfare home is nothing more than "public selection of a match," isn't that again "impossible"? Therefore, we hope that "婢女 who have been liberated" need a strict training institution to enable them to learn a skill by themselves; and there is a need for an employment agency to guide their career paths. That is true liberation, that is true freedom. As for item 3, for those who are adults (over sixteen years old), "seek their consent and choose a match for them." This is also a mistake caused by not understanding the principle that "a woman's way out is not to rely on her husband after marriage" as mentioned above. From these three incomplete methods, I am reminded that the reason for their liberation is fundamentally incomplete. They should take "婢女's true way out, true freedom as a major premise, and then they can study the thorough method.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Untitled <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Chenji</p>
<p>It is difficult for me to settle on a "title," I am very sad</p>
<p>A "primary school teacher" is a symbol of sadness right now. I am a "primary school teacher."</p>
<p>School has started. How difficult is my heart! —— The most difficult thing is: I can't even tell myself whether I am happy or sad?</p>
<p>I ran into the classroom with such a mood. Because the "timetable" has not yet been arranged, I talk to the children about current affairs or some principles of "how to be a person".</p>
<p>I am speaking so enthusiastically. I saw that the facial expressions of each child were tense or relaxed following the tension of my speech. However, what surprised me was an exceptionally new child whose face had no expression, only two eyebrows were standing on his eyes so melancholically, he neither smiled nor was indignant; his face was a pool of stagnant water!</p>
<p>When I stopped speaking, I remembered: Not many days ago, the school arranged for me to be on duty at the school. It was during the winter vacation, and all my colleagues had gone out, leaving me alone in the school. An elderly man came in and asked me, "Can I still register?" "Yes!" I replied. So he filled out the "registration form".</p>
<p>I asked him, "Is that child your son?"</p>
<p>"No! No!" He shook his head hurriedly, "He's my grandson!"</p>
<p>"He's your grandson?" I looked at his face. Saying he was an old man, he would not be over sixty. Yet he had a thirteen-year-old grandson.</p>
<p>He felt very uneasy about my suspicion. He coughed and immediately took out a handkerchief to cover his mouth. I saw tears floating in his eyes. I was surprised, "Why are there tears?" He pretended to blow his nose but I saw him wiping away the tears.</p>
<p>He sighed so lightly, fearing that others would know it was a sigh, and said, "Sir! That child studied in a private school in the countryside, or maybe his level in Shanghai is not enough, so I ask you, sir, to pay special attention!"</p>
<p>"Of course! Of course!" I saw him looking at me with such earnest eyes! After a while, he said:</p>
<p>"I'll pay the tuition and miscellaneous fees…"</p>
<p>He reached into his pocket and took out a handful of money. I gave him a receipt. He took the receipt and hurried away. I sent him to the door.</p>
<p>"Goodbye, sir!" His tone was slightly trembling.</p>
<p>"Goodbye! Goodbye!" His back was followed by a pile of sad ashes. …</p>
<p>Thinking of this, I looked very carefully at the face of the new child. —— It's a stagnant water face!</p>
<p>"Yes!" Very light, very light.</p>
<p>"Where does your dad do business?"</p>
<p>He just shook his head. I still thought he didn't understand my question, so I asked him again, speaking very slowly and clearly.</p>
<p>"Where does your dad do business?"</p>
<p>He shook his head and said, "No! No!"</p>
<p>"No business, unemployed?"</p>
<p>He seemed very embarrassed to answer me, but he had to answer me. He said, "No, my dad is dead!"</p>
<p>"Dead?"</p>
<p>Nodding.</p>
<p>"How many years has he been dead?"</p>
<p>"Six years."</p>
<p>"Then what about your mother?"</p>
<p>"She's dead too!"</p>
<p>He cried "wow". My heart was struck by a sharp sword. Some of the other children were staring at him in a daze, while others were saying with mocking faces</p>
<p>"Hey! He's crying! He's crying!"</p>
<p>The bell rang for the end of class. I didn't even have the courage to look at him. I quickly escaped into the "teachers' office." I regretted it so much. Why did I have to hurt this innocent little heart!</p>
<p>Alas! No son's sorrow, no mother's sorrow, alas! My tears also flowed down.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Night <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Hei Ding</p>
<p>Wang Lin had been sick for over ten days. Since the day he was driven out of the arsenal by soldiers on September 18th and lost his job, he had been spending his lonely days in distress. He walked the path of despair, in sorrow, in deep pain! He was like being trapped in a dark circle. He couldn't catch a comfortable breath. Like others, he had lost the guarantee of survival. He dared not think about this melancholic country, this vast and boundless field of sinful slaughter. He was truly worried that his family of four would be on the brink of starvation.</p>
<p>He had a wife and two children. The elder child was fourteen years old, named Xiao Mao. The younger child was not even three months old. Their lives were in an unspeakable state. He was bedridden, unable to get out of bed, due to his illness. Except for Xiao Mao and his mother, who secretly ran to the fields of the villagers in the eastern suburbs every day, carrying a large bamboo basket, to glean some corn, sorghum ears, and soybean pods to cook for the whole family to eat their fill, there was no other way to go.</p>
<p>However, winter was approaching soon. The lush and verdant countryside had become a desolate scene of withered yellow. From then on, they would not even have the blessing of eating corn, sorghum ears, and soybean pods.</p>
<p>They were treading a black line of starvation.</p>
<p>On the day before the New Year, Xiao Mao listened to his mother and went to his uncle's house in Huanggu Tun early in the morning, carrying a rice bag, intending to borrow some rice from his uncle to prepare for the New Year's meal tomorrow. Who knew that he would return home with disappointment: he said that his uncle's house only had a few bowls of rice left, and even he himself wouldn't have enough for tomorrow. Xiao Mao's mother sighed and looked at Xiao Mao's father, who was somewhat dazed at this moment. He closed his eyes and mumbled a few words in his throat, the last of which was: "Alas... just wait for death."</p>
<p>Evening. It was snowing. The northwest wind howled straight. Xiao Mao was not at home. He had gone out since noon and had not returned until now. Xiao Mao's mother and father suspected that he had gone to the residence of the Zhao family in Bianmen again to beg for leftovers. The little child refused to sleep and kept crying. There was no light in the room, and the surroundings were already a bit dim. The scraps of paper on the ceiling rustled non-stop. Xiao Mao's mother held the child, leaning against the wall. Xiao Mao's father lay beside Xiao Mao's mother, as if he was cold. He curled up tightly in a thin quilt. They didn't talk much. They hadn't eaten yet. They hoped that Xiao Mao would bring back the leftovers from that residence, they believed that Xiao Mao would do that. Their lives now depended on Xiao Mao alone: in the autumn, Xiao Mao went to the suburbs to glean corn, sorghum ears, and soybean pods, but in the winter, Xiao Mao had to go to people's doors every day to beg for leftovers to bring home. So they liked Xiao Mao very much.</p>
<p>The room was lonely. Adorned in this lonely air, it was truly a picture without the slightest pleasing color.</p>
<p>Just then, an alarming sound flew from the end of the alley, it seemed to be the sound of someone running, both chaotic and urgent. They were immediately frightened, wondering what trouble was brewing outside again! They listened carefully, but they couldn't hear people shouting, nor could they hear the gunshots that should have been there during a disturbance.</p>
<p>The sound came closer step by step, and went straight into the alley, and when the sound approached their gate, they only heard the gate being kicked open with a snap. Then a black shadow jumped into the room, and before they could see who it was, the person who jumped in shouted hoarsely and stutteringly: "Dad, Dad, Dad..."</p>
<p>Taking a breath, he continued, "Dad, quickly give me a sack..."</p>
<p>This shout was originally Xiao Mao. His appearance made them all afraid, so everyone's face had a kind of nervous flush.</p>
<p>Xiao Mao's father, in a daze, got up from the bed, jumped to the ground, grabbed Xiao Mao's wrist, trembling, and said: "You, you, what happened?"</p>
<p>Xiao Mao used a very dirty palm, grabbing haphazardly on his forehead several times: his palms were covered with sweat. He spat out a mouthful of spit, then cracked his lips: "This time, we are going to... you don't know, the Hengxingde Grain and Rice Store on 　　Street was robbed! There are so many people at the door, all holding rice bags. There was an argument in the room. I want to take the sack to grab some so we can celebrate the New Year tomorrow..."</p>
<p>Before Xiao Mao finished speaking, Xiao Mao's father jumped up almost crazily, he clenched his fist and said hatefully; "Go, I'll go too, otherwise we will starve to death..."</p>
<p>Xiao Mao's mother, hurriedly stepped forward and grabbed the lapel of Xiao Mao's father, and said in a pleading tone; "Xiao Mao's father, you are sick, you can't go, you are sick..."</p>
<p>But, he finally ran out the door, Xiao Mao followed behind. When they left the alley, Xiao Mao's mother stood blankly on the stone steps of the gate, raising her voice, shouting like this: "Xiao Mao, you must take good care of your father, don't be careless, life is important..."</p>
<p>However, they pretended not to hear, but ran like the wind towards 　　Street. Arriving at 　　Street, arriving at the entrance of Hengxingde, they squeezed into the crowd desperately. Xiao Mao couldn't squeeze in, at first he firmly held his father's clothes with his hand, but holding, hitting</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>hitting, Xiao Mao was finally squeezed away, he looked up for a long time and finally he found his father carrying two bags of foreign flour out. But, at this moment, gunshots suddenly rang out outside the door. As a result, the large crowd gathered at the door ran away, fell down, and for a while, a tragic scene was presented. Under this condition, Xiao Mao's father loosened the two bags of foreign flour on his shoulders and quickly lay on the ground. Xiao Mao cried and shouted, and crawled on the ground with both hands. The gunshots tightened. After a while, Xiao Mao quietly curled up in the flowing pool of blood.</p>
<p>Night shrouded the earth. Four troop-carrying trucks of the ×× military garrison team flew from the main street in Bianmen.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Wagon Sheet Draped <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>— Bitter Snow of Homecoming IV</p>
<p>These days, the entire mood is buried in joy, how can we express it? There is an indescribable emotion in the bottom of my heart!</p>
<p>The sky pulled down a sad face, cried tears, and piled lightly on the ground. Where did the gust of evil wind come from? It rolled up the accumulated tears and slammed wildly on every pedestrian and building. The shop signs rattled and squeaked.</p>
<p>We are running along the crisscrossing railroad tracks, stepping on the thick snow. It is estimated that the snow should be more than five inches! The heavy oil boots shattered the mirror-like snow surface. When you are not paying attention, if your foot steps on a bumpy place, it will jump into the shoe socket, and the coolness will penetrate from the soles of your feet to your dantian, and your body will shiver.</p>
<p>——Can you spot the wagon sheet? Xiao Wei asked me, holding a bag of things in his hand.</p>
<p>Wagon sheet? This is a new name in my ears.</p>
<p>——Don’t understand? He smiled, a sudden thought made him realize that this name was unfamiliar to me, so he greeted me and asked me to do the same work as him.</p>
<p>The south end and the north end have been almost everywhere, but the numbers on the wagon sheets are difficult to find. The ribbon on Xiao Wei's fur hat fluttered in the wind. The ears seemed to have been bitten off by a cat. The vast railway network was devoid of pedestrians.</p>
<p>Later, Xiao Wei really became anxious and didn't care about the cold wind. He took off his hat, grabbed his hair, and thought. Steam was billowing from the top of his head, and there was a solemn expression on his forehead that was not easy to see.</p>
<p>——Let’s do this, he decided, handing me part of the things in his hand: you go to that end to find it, and I will go somewhere else. We need to divide and cooperate. After a pause, he looked at the watch in his hand: Okay, hurry up, they are still waiting for us to go back for dinner!</p>
<p>Along the junction, I was calculating in my heart that there were still six wagon sheets missing. How can I find them? Really, I was a little scared. I thought, if I can’t find the wagon sheets as desired, maybe I will be subject to some unsatisfactory punishment? Fear was lurking in my throat.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a sound of hurried footsteps behind me. I looked at it and Xiao Wei ran over in a panic and said——</p>
<p>——Forgot, forgot, we will all be waiting for you at the street corner of the station for a while to gather there! After saying that, he left quickly against the wind and snow.</p>
<p>December, the day is very short, the street corner on that side has already lit up the street lights, dim, quickly swept down, everything only exists in a vague outline.</p>
<p>Let’s go back. I found three sections, and maybe the remaining ones were discovered among them, I thought like this. Following the dim street lights, I walked to the street corner that had been agreed upon!</p>
<p>——Why are you so late? We have been waiting for a long time. A Liu smiled: Let’s go, let’s go to 　　to fill our stomachs first. He pulled me and turned into the street corner.</p>
<p>In the hotel, we didn’t want to sleep. We were planning the only tomorrow. Who would buy what? How would we install the head car? And the food for the road, as well as what drinks and so on...</p>
<p>——We have to get up early tomorrow, go to bed.</p>
<p>——Tell the waiter not to let the charcoal fire go out.</p>
<p>Lying in the quilt, my heart will not be calm. The fire supports the warmth in the room. On the window, the zither is still playing a solo!</p>

<h3 id="e223">Notes on Visiting the Chiba Soy Sauce Industry in Japan (VII) <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— (Ye Xiyuan)</p>
<p>After visiting these soy sauce companies in Chiba, we deeply felt that even the soy sauce business must be large-scale. Japanese soy sauce companies have at least a capital of one to two million or even twenty to thirty million, because of mass production and rationalization, the production cost will inevitably be reduced, and the market will inevitably expand. When we first went, although we were not without ambition, considering the backwardness of our country's economy, how could we expect to reach the same level; moreover, the people of our country only know how to engage in speculation, but do not know how to strive for the development of the national economic production business? After returning, because of the relationship between China and Japan, it was not calm, and we could not realize our ideals. In a blink of an eye, it has been four or five years. Now, when I hold the pen to write this article, although the Northeast is no longer our country, the people of our country should be aware: in the future, I still hope that our previous ideals can be realized one day, then I will not write this article in vain.</p>
<p>Finally, I must thank Mr. Namiki Jutarō of Noda Soy Sauce Company, Mr. Mogi Saheiji, Mr. Yonezawa Yasushi of Yamataka Soy Sauce Company, and Mr. Shinogi Shigeru and Mr. Hamaguchi Rinzo of Hatako Soy Sauce Company. This is because of their hospitality and leadership that we did not make this trip to Chiba in vain. Although the time has passed for several years, I wish their businesses will progress day by day and their health will progress day by day. (The End)</p>

<p>"Tragedy of the Lakeside"</p>
<p>A certain old man's daughter, named Bai Wei, also known as Su Ping, followed her father to study in Beiping in her childhood, and admired Yang Mengmei, a poor student who stayed in France. They were both deeply in love and vowed to form a good marriage.</p>
<p>Who knows that the sky is not as one wishes, and the environment is pressing. A certain old man used the authority of his father and brother to wrongly marry his daughter to his friend's family. Bai Wei vowed not to obey and was imprisoned by her father on the shore of West Lake. The woman committed suicide, but fortunately, she was rescued and did not succeed. Bai Wei hid her name and made up her mind to become an unprecedented living corpse. The father saw the suicide note and regretted it. He loved his daughter and hated her, and was overwhelmed with grief. He ordered the servant to open another room as a place for the woman to rest her soul, providing three meals a day to worship, and arranging the bed and quilt at night, and erected his beloved daughter's tomb on the shore of the lake, in order to pay tribute.</p>
<p>Days and months passed, and three years passed in an instant. Yang Sheng took his younger brother to Hangzhou for sightseeing, and happened to stay in a quiet room at night. Mengmei was writing by the light of the lamp, and vaguely heard the weeping of a resentful woman. Yang Sheng was curious, so he followed the sound.</p>
<p>As soon as Mengmei came out, Bai Wei entered. She happened to see Yang's younger brother sleeping soundly, and the woman was shocked and wanted to retreat. She caught a glimpse of the manuscript on the table, held it and recited it, sometimes sad and sometimes happy. Suddenly, sorrow came from her heart, because she was reading Yang Sheng's tearful history. Then she inquired about Yang's younger brother, and learned that Mengmei was forced to marry, but still missed Bai Wei. The woman secretly thought that her ambition was in vain, so she used a plan to escape.</p>
<p>When Mengmei returned, his younger brother told him, so the brothers searched everywhere, and they only found her when they heard the gunshot. Yang Sheng was overjoyed, but who knew that the woman died soon after. Alas, the sky did not bless her, and they only met for the last time. Mengmei was too stimulated, and his illness broke out and he coughed up blood and died. Alas, the tragedy on the lake is the fault of stubbornness.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Plum Blossom Snow"</p>
<p>Plum blossoms are just blooming and snow is piling up. Plum blossoms in the snow are even brighter. Without snow, the plum blossoms lack charm. Without plum blossoms, the snow lacks interest. The fragrance of plum blossoms carries a smile and the snow floats cold. The snow reflects the plum blossoms and the plum blossoms accompany the snow. Snow is more pure and clean than plum blossoms. Plum blossoms can compete with snow to be the queen of flowers. The garden is open like snow. Playing in the snow can also be like exploring plum blossoms. The plum blossoms are determined to urge the end of winter. The snow melts and the plum blossoms bloom, calling for spring to come. Hao Ran steps on the snow to find plum blossoms. The snow embraces the inner boudoir and the flowers are blooming. Snow presses the plum blossoms and a high-ranking scholar lies down. Plum blossoms bloom on a snowy night and a beautiful woman comes. Watching the plum blossoms and admiring the snow makes the red sticky and warm. Plum blossoms and snow are both clear and pleasant. It can be said that snow and plum blossoms form a ring.</p>

<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>"Song of Everlasting Regret" was screened at the Carlton yesterday morning. The opening scene of the film has a humorous interlude: Among animals, only dogs - since they were given a special environment, they have become independent and incompatible. They are often seen fighting. They are the most courageous animals to fight privately, and they are also the most snobbish. Look at them in front of their owners, shaking their heads and wagging their tails, pretending to be pitiful, but when they see people wearing worn clothes and have nothing to eat, their appearance is very ugly. But, do you say it is the dog's fault? Is it human's fault? Let's not study this for the time being. Here, we want to talk about people.</p>
<p>But: - Let's take a look at people!</p>
<p>Cheng Bugao's new work "New and Old Shanghai" has passed the review, and the selection of the protagonist is 　　, which is probably waiting for 　　Ying.</p>
<p>There is still no news about "Rouge Well" and "Night Meeting", which is very memorable.</p>
<p>According to a letter from Xu Ruhui of the Ziye Music Association, the production fee for "Brothers" has been paid by the Star Company, and the advertising ranking for "Brothers" will also be published later. This is hereby corrected.</p>

<p>— Luo Gong</p>
<p>Gao Zhanfei resembles Shen Xiling's performance in "Boatman's Girl". He is still so strong and so enthusiastic. He is a very loyal character, but if someone is sorry for him, he will be just as sorry for others; anger is like an erupting volcano; he believes in the power of his own fist; when he is drunk, he is like a beast, and the beast wants to devour its enemies. In the tenderness and comfort, he is still as tame as a sheep! In the end, his rough throat vowed never to sing love songs again.</p>
<p>Yan Yuexian is a woman who follows gold, enjoying herself to the fullest, intoxicated to the fullest, and making gold angry to the fullest. However, she is also firmly cutting off her own destiny and destroying her own future. One day, when she realizes that gold has deceived her, the person who loves her loves someone else, and her own daughter scolds her for being a slave! Stop it? Die! How can death bury a body of sin?</p>
<p>Huang Naishuang: Wu Cun originally decided that this role would be played by Gao Qianping. Later, when Gao Qianping left, people were selected and it was discovered that Huang Naishuang was more suitable for playing this role. She sympathizes with Lao Gao, who has been stimulated, and in order to raise Lao Gao's son, she sacrificed her old father! But she does not complain about Lao Gao, she only encourages him to work hard and make progress!</p>
<p>Sun Min: This unfair society treats this bad guy too favorably. He doesn't really fall in love with people, he just wants to give people revenge! He only uses the stinky money that this stinky society gave him to subdue people. He never expected that the old man's fist was strong! He lay on the steps for a long sleep! It is still that corpse that should be imprisoned.</p>
<p>Zhu Qiuhen: Do you want to clearly understand the so-called "big star"? Come and see Zhu Qiuhen's performance! I'm worried that she will make people angry!</p>
<p>Wang Xianqi: You must be saying, "Bad guy"! That's right, that's enough to tell you!</p>
<p>Xie Yunqing: Holding two dull eyes, he is blind, but he said that this society is more blind than a blind person and cannot see the light!</p>

<p>The "Thunder and Lightning Drama Society," which suddenly emerged in 1936, was certainly not accidental. It was the result of the efforts of several enthusiastic theater people to create this infant—the "Thunder and Lightning Drama Society."</p>
<p>They hold the greatest hope, dedicating all their spirit and strength to working hard in the theatrical movement, dropping a bomb on this thriving theatrical movement of 1936, giving the Chinese theater scene some new vitality!</p>
<p>Now they are focusing on internal construction because everything must be built firmly internally before it can begin to develop externally. Therefore, these two weeks have been spent on this construction work.</p>
<p>The first step of construction is: to elect Chen Lian as the leader to establish a council and jointly handle the affairs of the society, so all affairs are proceeding smoothly.</p>
<p>On the one hand, they are selecting scripts, preparing to start rehearsals. We will soon see the day their scripts are announced!</p>
<h3 id="e234">Cathay Screens "The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo" <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>Cole Porter's Latest Starring Masterpiece</p>
<p>Produced by Twentieth Century Fox, starring Cole Porter, "The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo" is being shown at the Cathay Grand Theatre starting today (Saturday). The opening scene of the film takes place in a famous club in Monte Carlo. Porter plays a desperate Western European Russian duke who stakes all his savings on a single gamble at the casino. He wins millions of francs and becomes a millionaire overnight, but later, because of a woman, he loses all the money he won, but the woman falls in love with him. This is a work that best suits Porter's personality. The female supporting role is the famous Joan Bennett. The film features gorgeous scenery in Monte Carlo and Paris, as well as the elegant scenery of the snowy mountains in Switzerland.</p>
