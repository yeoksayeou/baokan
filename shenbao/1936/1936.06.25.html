<h3 id="c24">當前之兩大問題 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— 年</p>
<p>英國經濟使節羅斯爵士日前發表洋洋長篇之臨別贈言其中如陳述日當局對中國關稅問題之態度及討論中國减低進口稅率等雖頗有可商之處而全文好意所在亦殊可感吾人對於羅斯爵士提及之中國治安與華北特殊情形兩端感觸特深請申論之</p>
<p>羅斯爵士之言曰「中國之貨幣前途乃至將來整個的金融地位第一須視中國內地治安之維持第二須藉華北特殊情形之解决」原文對此當前兩大問題以發言者所處地位關係僅予提明未加詳闡實則就吾人觀察此兩問題性質之重要有過於羅斯注意陳述之其他部分因此乃中國安危之所繫貨幣金融特其所關之一點耳</p>
<p>目前禦侮勦匪以外之國內治安問題雖消息弛緊無常聞者恐懼談者色沮然二中全會距今不過二週之時日解紛息爭或有可望而宋韓聯名通電中央懇切表示亦皆足緩和時局使蓄意興戎者得以警覺更進一步言之則反對內戰民意已趨一致當事者卽讀「陸沉無日」之言而未有悔悟一致之民意亦足發生制止之效力違一致之民意者必失敗往事如斯可以鑑也</p>
<p>華北特殊情形有關係政治外交者有關係經濟者茲椎羅斯發言之旨就關係經濟之走私問題言之羅斯於此輕信一方面之飭言故有種種困難卽可獲得解决之道之希望記者則觀於私貨之橫襲市塲緝私之遭遇阻碍以爲非國民有自力阻止私貨之决心不足以促困難之解决現在政府方面已發表嚴厲之懲治條例漏稅之罪重者處死千元以上者卽須受無期徒刑禁令之重無以復加惟望一般人民能助法條之推行共同拒絕私貨以維護正當之商業則走私者之技旣窮走私問題卽不難如羅斯所言獲得解决之道矣</p>
<p>羅斯爵士爲考察中國財政上經濟上之困難并决定恊助中國克服此種困難之可能而來故其立言類以貨幣金融爲範圍然彼聯帶提及之兩項先决條件惟有藉民意與民力方可獲得有效之解决願國人知自身力量之足恃而有所努力焉</p>

<h3 id="c29">英下院討論外交　工黨彈劾案否决　國際法治代野蠻勢力失敗　英國政治仍以國聯為基礎 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>（倫敦）反政府工黨領袖阿特里、因政府决議贊助取銷對意制裁、今日特在下院提出彈劾政府案如下、「英政府决定堅决一貫之外交政策、致减低國家之威望、挫弱國聯之地位、並危及和平、故已喪失本院之信任」云、阿氏與反政府自由黨辛克萊氏對於政府之行動、均發言痛加抨擊、由內務大臣西門代政府作答、末由首相鮑爾溫演說、結束辯論、遂將彈劾案付表决、以三八四對一七〇票否决、</p>
<p>今日下院空氣之緊張、不若上星期四政府宣佈準備取銷對意制裁時之甚、集會之前、外相艾登曾與阿皇會談三刻鐘之久、意國駐倫大使格蘭第曾在旁聽席靜聆辯論、</p>
<p>阿特里提出彈劾政府動議時宣稱、政府於已往五年中、進行懦弱折猶豫之政策、致使國家自一九三一年高昂之地位而墮落、（閣員席起嘲笑之呼聲）、政府背離阿比西尼亞、並破壞國聯、使不復以有實效的工具謀取和平、今設容意大利對阿比西尼亞而奏凱、則國聯任何會員國將無安全之可言、不列顚帝國非全贊同取銷制裁、最受密切影響之自治領（南菲聯邦）反對此舉甚力、南菲土人與全世界、不知對此將有何種感慨、如墨索里尼願擴張其統治權、試問包爾溫首相其將為索瑪里倫蘇丹或甘雅戰事、政府不肯冒和平之危險、實已增重戰爭之危險、政府於有聯合歐洲成一眞正集體安全之機會時、竟棄之而不顧、</p>
<p>繼起發言者為自由反對黨要員辛克萊、謂政府於意阿爭案之危局中始終為畏念所制、意大利曾處於國聯經濟權力之掌握中、當此利器正將發生實效時、政府竟委棄之、政府之政策、實使侵略者、利外獲利、並使世界託庇於狄克推多、政府在斯特萊薩會議中卽應明吿墨索里尼、如渠堅持對阿之政策、則英國人民全體將起抗之、辛氏且不以國聯或製裁已吿失敗為然、謂特未予以一種機會耳、</p>
<p>於是西門起代政府作答、謂渠與諸議員同、深覺國聯巳遭重大之挫衂、財政與經濟制裁、並不能保全一會員國免受外方之侵略、以國際秩序代替野蠻威勢之努力、已吿失敗、政府與贊助政府者之感覺此事加諸國際道德主義之損害、其深切固不遜於反對黨也、或謂制裁應較早實施、則今日或已收效、殊不知國聯盟約規定非至戰事發生、不能取此步驟，質言之、艾登推進此項行動、實較任何人為速也、艾登前嘗聲明英國甚樂見油制裁之實施、乃仍有人以此項制裁未成事實、而歸咎於英政府、此誠不公之論也、凡希望制裁獲有良好結果者、今見制裁已歸失敗、意阿戰事已吿終止、莫不為之深切失望、制裁之繼續實施、不能更變、此結果、實施制裁者今須裁决目前環境是否當與主用武力以變更决議者沆瀣一氣、渠信國聯會員國無一準備用此武力、英政府亦不準備用之也、有人倡說英國如果開戰、則地中海之英海軍或已被制服矣、此實不然、渠敢信英海軍處此必建有甚美之戰績、但政府處目前歐洲之局勢與夫包圍英國之重大危險中、殊不願見為阿此西尼亞之故、縱獲勝利之海戰、而有一艦之彼沉、政府並不改變其政策、或因目前所取之行動而改變對國聯之忠誠、政府今正對彼現實、並考慮如何可使國聯地位强固、俾得於將來應付此種衝擊與爭案、如是為國聯效勞、當可遠勝於今日、外相已着手進行此舉、且已與其他國聯會員國接洽、此舉又顯必商諸自治領、而後始能作决者也、</p>
<p>最後由首相包爾溫結束辯論、謂政府並無寬恕意大利行動之意志、政府無貸欵與意國之權力、且不欲覓求此種權力、集體安全已吿失敗、因歐洲各國幾全不欲進行軍事制裁也、國聯今日之職責、在就最近所受之經騐、察視今後能如何作為、英國之政策、仍以國聯為根據、</p>
<p>首相繼乃稱讚艾登以其心靈置於維持國聯之奮鬥中、謂政府之反對繼續與强化對意制裁、蓋以今除軍事行動外、不能稍變意大利與阿比西尼亞之地位也、國聯已遭惡劣之挫敗、但第一次企圖實施集體安全之失敗、决不能目為國聯已壽終正寢、九月間國聯大會集議時、自必進行各事也、政府目下不特須商定自己之决議　須與自治領政府及國聯其他各會員國政府非正式交換意見、而尤注重法國、政府政策之第二目的、乃在綏靖大局、或謂英國苟能於西面安衛其本國、則政府擬聽令歐洲全部求自全之道、此種見解、實無根據、惟國聯如終歸破裂、則或將有此一日、第渠抱有種種希望、他日三大國開始談判時、必能籌得中歐各國安全之道、蓋英政府亦望為英國籌得之也云、（二十四日路透電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）外交部長台爾博斯在議院發表外交政策宣言之後、當卽開始辯論、右派中央派議員多人、先後發表意見、對於歐局危亟情形、有所說明、其中保守黨議員葛禮利斯、謂德國現有立卽攻擊捷克之可能、此在在法國、事前絕未有所準備、不知將若何應付、卽就法國本身而言、「德國坦克車一千八百輛、連同機械化隊伍若干師、可於兩日之內、通過比國而達法國、此其危險、亦未可忽視也」、嗣由台爾博斯發言答復、略謂、德國國社黨標榜種族主義、其所懷抱之願望、自較純粹標榜國家主義者為尤甚、此項危險、余所深知、「特法國現仍持以鎭靜、並將竭其能力以保障國際公理、對於德國廢止羅卡諾公約之舉、僅當視為非法行為、意義明白、不容曲解也、國聯大會本月杪舉行非常會議時、羅卡諾公約各簽字國、自當乘機交換意見、屆時德國對於英國問題表、若已提出答案、法國卽當加以研究、以冀覓求妥的之基礎、總之法國對於任何國家、均不加以威脅、亦不容他國再來威脅、「法國服膺公理、當以全力完成其艱巨　資」云云、至晚間十時、討論宣吿終結、參議院則定於星期四日討論政府宣言書、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>宣言書首段述及集體安全之機構、謂國聯會盟約、不宜加以普泛的修正、祇須在文字上略事刪改　俾盟約條文之解釋、不生疑意、於事已足、就法國政府所見、集體安全機構、應具有兩要點、卽（一）凡與侵略國鄰近各國、須出其全力以抵抗侵略國、（二）國聯會其他各會員國、對於侵略國、務當一律實施經濟財政制裁手段、至於各種區域公約、旣非威脅任何國家之工具、亦不常成為歐戰前之同盟制度、「法國政府現擬竭力促進區域公的之談判、如多瑙河公約、及由西班牙與巴爾幹恊商各國等國參加之一種地中海公約、卽其例也」、關於德國問題、宣言書謂、隸屬左派人民陣綫各黨、夙昔之志、在使法德兩國釋嫌言好、不憚奮全力以赴之、無如德國廢止凡爾賽和約軍事條欵於前、破壞羅卡諾公約於後、種種經過、歷歷在吾人腦海中、豈能淡焉忘之、「雖然法國對於德國任何建議、現仍準備加以考慮、以冀覓得妥恊基礎、特此項妥恊、不當針對任何國而發耳」、述及軍縮問題、謂法國决定要求國聯會在日內瓦糾織常務委員會、凡關於軍火之製造、與販賣統制消息、均令其儘量發表、目前政府先當要求國會通過軍火工業收歸國營之法案、此卽國家統制之第一步辦法也、關於天空公約、謂法國準備簽訂限制天空軍備之公約、不論在西歐一隅、或將全歐各國、包括在內、均所接受、最後宣言書謂、在安寗自由之環境中、思想自由與民治進步、乃係人類奕世相承之權利、法國决當為之保障云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>南京通信、二十五年度之開始、轉瞬卽屆、京市政府茲為使二十五年度行政計劃與經費　預算互相適應起見、在草擬行政計劃時期、卽同時編製預算該項計劃、日前經整理後、卽送請市府再度審議、茲據市政府負責人談述各節如次、</p>
<p>預算標凖收入無增</p>
<p>市府編製二十五年度預算、除為適應行政計劃與計劃同時編製外、並依照二十四年度經費為標準、按二十四年度本市預算、經常歲入為五百六十五萬七千四百二十五元、臨時歲入為三百六十八萬元、合計九百三十三萬七千四百二十五元、經常歲出四百七十三萬九千九百十九元、臨時歲出四百五十九萬七千五百零六元、合計九百三十三萬七千四百二十五元、二十四年度預算不足數、原在二百餘萬元以上、旋以籌欵困難、故將一部份不急之建設、暫緩進行、我經費不足數减至一百餘萬元、二十五年度經費預算、現正在計算、大致擬核减與二十四年度相等、最多不足數在一百五十萬與二百萬元之間、</p>
<p>市府支出之經費、以敎育費為最多、次之為闢路等之建築費、二十五年行政計劃、除增設學校開闢道路外、並擬整理棚戶區域、蓋本市棚戶貧民甚多、若不予以救濟、非惟與市容有礙、且與其生活之發展、頗有問題、總之、本市係首都所在之區、建設事業繁多、惟因經費困難、卒難於短時期中、以達到吾人理想之目的、至二十五年度歲入預算、並無增加、雖士地稅於下年度可開始徵收、惟其中房捐部份、巳規定佔去十分之三、則地價稅亦僅佔十分之七、將來合計收入、恐僅及一百萬元之數、茲該項預算、雖已審定、惟尙須送交行政院核定、</p>
<p>房捐征收七折計算</p>
<p>京市政府徵收土地稅及改良稅、原定二十五年度起同時實施、目前對估定地價一項、可依土地法估定地價各規定辦理、當不困難、本市過去原有土地評價委員會設立、對估計地價一點、頗有經騐、惟改良物之估計、雖可於估計地價時為之、但舊時改良物、估計極感不易、卽詢之業戶、亦多瞠目不知、且估計改良物、事實上必須按戶實地勘察、分別估計、於估計後、並需通知業戶、一有異議、又須舉行公斷、故全市改良物之估計、非二三年之久不能完成、</p>
<p>市府在改良物稅未能與土地稅同時實行之前、擬將房捐保留、並為體恤市民負担、核减至七折計算、此項辦法、業經內政部通過、俟行政院再行核定、卽可實施、至舊有房捐、每年可收入六七十萬元、如以七折計算、卽减至四十餘萬元、土地稅總數定為六十萬元、其稅率一項、正在呈請行政院核定、依目前情形而論、在改良稅未實行以前、市民負担、實巳較輕、蓋市府為兼顧市庫收入及市民負担、一面旣不願稅收短絀、一面亦須顧及市民負担、不使有稅率重疊之感、</p>

<p>— 薛德焴</p>
<p>各種學問中和人生的關係最深，而我國一般靑年輒視為無足重輕的生物學，究竟是怎樣一種學問？究竟為什麽要研究生物學？我上次所講的是生物學對於人類的貢獻，今天所要講的是「今後怎樣研究生物學」。</p>
<p>為會麽要研究生物學。我們為什麽要研究生物學，可以分理論的和實際的兩方面講，從理論方面說：人類和其他生物同循進化的路徑，何以人類在自然界所佔的位置顯與其他生物不同。就體制上觀察，人類遠不及獅虎，旣無攻防的器官，又無强大的體力，何以能為萬物之靈？我以為這是人類經營社會生活之賜。我們先要認淸楚「不是人類製造社會，是社會製造人類」。你如不信，可提出一個證據。試取苗族的小兒，放在我們的社會敎育，等到成人以後，可和我們做同樣的事業，有同樣的貢獻；惝送文明人的小兒到苗族的團體內養育，雖天資聰頴，終身一無作為，一無貢獻；故人之於世，有無貢獻，則視背後有無社會而定。曦類和蜂類雖亦有社會，但是他們的社會已達於極點，不能再有進步；而人類的社會，正在蓬蓬勃勃地向前進步和發展。</p>
<p>人類社會的本源是家庭，一夫一婦的制度，不僅發源於性慾的衝動，兼發源於子孫的養護和敎育，而人類幼兒的生育期，比其他一切生物為長，因是夫婦各有關係，不得不有永久的家庭組織。旣有家庭，即有家長，一家的人，需受家長的支配和統治。換句話說：一家的人要服從有中心勢力的家長，决沒有絕對的自由。</p>
<p>在生物學的原則上，弱的動物團結起來，亦能抵抗强敵，螞蟻臭蟲即其一例，人類為自衛計，為恊力抗敵計，集家而成族，集挨而成村，有强在中心勢力，有服從的精神，始有今日人類社會的進步。因社會由個人組織而成，於是「個人主義」與「中央集權主義」兩種精神，即不免互相角逐，這兩種精神的爭鬥史，就形成人類的歷史。我們用生物學的眼光來調查人類進步的經歷，庶幾一切思想問題，社會問題之所由生，才能澈底明瞭，纔能合理解决，如不從本源上着想而欲從事於改良社會，這無異於緣木求魚，不可得也。至於改良人種，復興民族，改良家畜和作物，如不以遺傳學上的理論為基礎，亦决無圓滿的結果。又人類的保健以及各種的產業問題，都應以生物學為基礎，故生物學者，應站在社會的第一道綫上做總指揮，庶幾人類的文明，更能蒸蒸日上。</p>
<p>從實際方面說：麻，棉，毛，絲等衣料，染衣的顏料，五穀，蔬，菓，肉，卵等食料，茶與咖啡等飲料，木材等建築料或燃料，引起疾病的病源體，以及治療疾病的各種藥料，概括的說，衣食住的材料，製造工業的原料，無一不是利用生物，無一不是直接和人類生活有密切的關係。</p>
<p>生物學怎樣分科　從理論和實際方面說，我們自有研究生物學的必要。生物學始於巳往的動物學和植物學，兩者硏究的目的相同，而方法不同。後者——動物學，植物學——重記載（記物），分類（識物），及用途（用物）；前者——生物學——重經騐推理，並注意自然界的現象和生活的原理。隨時代的進步，生物學已分為許多科，茲依各科的性質，可分為下列三類：</p>
<p>（甲）純正生物學　純正生物學是屬於理論的科學，故又名理論生物學The　oatic　Biology」視其對象物的種類，便利上又可分「動物學」「植物學」和「人類學」三羣。各羣如再詳細分科，又可分「形態學」和「生理學」兩部。形態學又稱構造的科學Science　of　Construction，專講生物體形態，構造並從種族間相互構造的比較而求其系統；內又分「器官學」「解剖學」，（組織學，細胞學，核學）「胚胎學」和「分類學」。生理學是生活現象的科學Science　of　vital　Phenomena，從廣義方面解說，又可認為生命的科學Science　of　Life，以討論各種生活原理的「生理學」為基礎，並包括討論生活作用與外界環境關係的「生態學」和討論系統個體間的世代關係的「遺傳學」。</p>
<p>（乙）人生生物學　人生生物學是討論動植物體內所行的各種生活現象，對於人體的生活作用究竟有怎樣影響？某種生物體的存在，他的生活作用，對於人生生活，究竟有怎樣的影響？又生物體對於無機界的作用，和人生究竟有怎樣的關係？總括的說，人生生物學是以與人生生活攸關的事項為基礎而討論人生和生物生活間的生態的　係。</p>
<p>（丙）應用生物學　可作衣食住的材料和製造工業原料的生物，怎樣地去利用？和人生生活有關的知識，怎樣地去擴展？這就是應用生物學所研究的範圍。我們日常生活所需的種類和各種製產物，都是受應用生物學之賜。對於生利方面，有農學，林學，製造工業學，農產製造學，園藝學，養蠶學，畜牧學，水產製造學及水產魚撈學等分科，應用範圍逐年擴展，分科亦遂年增加。因此生物與人生的關係亦愈密切，其進步，不僅直接關係於個人之生活，並能增進國家的富源。</p>
<p>我們研究的目標　生物學旣有純正生物學和應用生物學之別，我們硏究的目標，究竟着重在純正生物學呢？還是在應用生物學呢？從歷史上看，具體的科學都由實際的知識發育而成，實用固先理論而進步。例如植物學，發源於本草，有用植物及園藝；酵母菌之於發酵；衛生物之於疾病；繁殖實騐之於食用植物與雜交等等；故有人主張無實利益的學問，即無硏究之價值，這種極端注重應用生物學，而輕視純正生物學的見解，亦未免錯誤。卽如上次所講的雷汶胡克和巴斯　兩純正生物學家的研究，他們在硏究時，並未夢想到這種硏究大有貢獻於世，其目的祇在探求眞理，擴展人智，而結果使我們能在衛生方面和病源體决戰，在貯食方面獲得許多利益，這都是受純正科學者之賜；所以我們切勿視純正生物學為無益之學問，至少要了解探求眞理的學者，往往能產生影響於世界人類的偉大事業，倘坐井觀天，專以實利實益為主，輒阻害人智的進步。</p>

<p>實業部上海商品檢騐局、以滬市為工商業中心、倉庫業·米廠業·麵粉廠業·等、發達為全國冠、一般積穀蟲害發生、每年損失不貲、特派專家樓作周調查、茲已結果、華東社記者、略誌其情形如次、</p>
<p>倉庫中之蟲害情形</p>
<p>倉庫之受積穀蟲害蹂躪者、大都不通空氣不透陽光、地位潮濕、洞隙甚多、予害蟲以滋生機會、　氣候關係、如溫度濕度、均能直接影響害蟲之滋生、若某時期之氣溫及氣濕、適於倉庫中某種害蟲之繁殖發育、則害蟲大行猖獗、　倉庫中所發現之積穀害蟲、常出沒於垃圾敗屑隙縫之間、　積榖害蟲多雜食性、能嚼食多種穀物為食料、穀物不斷、害蟲得長期生存、　滬地舟車雲集、搬入運出貨物、終年不停故害蟲傳播機會甚多、</p>
<p>積穀害蟲種類繁複</p>
<p>倉庫中所生之積穀害蟲、甚為敏複、數量（甲）蛾類、　一點穀蛾、　大斑　蛾、　印度穀蛾、　麥蛾、　（乙）　類、　穀象、　綠豆象蟲、赤擬穀盜、　大粉蟲、　黑繭蟲、為害均甚烈云、</p>
<p>米廠害蟲約計五種</p>
<p>為害最烈者、一點穀蛾、蔓延於沿蘇州河兩岸、　大粉蟲、蔓延於新閘路及前述地帶、　黑蔴蟲、　赤擬穀盜、蔓延公館馬路天潼路各米廠、　大蟲盜在優良之白米中、亦有發現、但有捕殺他種害蟲及自相殘殺之習性、同時可稱益蟲、</p>
<p>麵粉廠中殊少發現</p>
<p>上海各類粉廠、管理有對於粉袋之積疊、頗有次序、棧房位置及建築、亦常合高　、通風透光、清潔諸條件、故害蟲較少、惟小麥倉庫、灰蓬四壁碎粒滿地、穀象甚為猖獗、侵蝕小麥、使麥粒空虛、變為粒屑、此外尚有麥蛾、大粉蟲、穀盜類等、為類亦不少、</p>

<p>銀錢兩業營業計劃</p>
<p>新聲社記者、昨向銀錢兩業探悉、銀行錢莊、鑒於市面之不景氣、自去年起、對各項放欵特別愼重、並一致緊縮、以資節省開支、至於員工之雇用與裁减、素以年底爲去留、外傳銀錢兩業、於夏節大批裁减員工之說、實屬不　、以後銀錢兩業、仍本以前之宗旨而行、况今年之銀行業上半年度决算期雖將屆、因營業之謹愼、所以各商業銀行仍能獲盈餘云、</p>
<p>銀行决算錢業還欵</p>
<p>銀行業定七月一日二日休假、辦理廿五年上半年度决算、關於儲蓄部結息、已於二十日實行、商業部結息、定今日開始、銀行公會、定甘七日下午四時召開會員大會、報吿會務、　各錢莊前向中央中國交通二銀行拆借之一千八百萬元、現尙有一千四百萬元未歸還、因早已逾期、所以承借各莊於夏節後、卽設法絡續　還、</p>

<p>國幣四萬三千二百元、此案昨晨十時半、由黃日升推事開刑八庭傳訊、被吿康翔榮未到、委李逢申律師出庭、即據自訴人代理李寳　律師起稱、自訴人康史金英即康史氏、現因患肺病頗劇、喉部浮腫、病勢頗危、臥病於中國紅十字會醫院七號房間、恐將不久於人世、故今日不能到實、該律師並陳述</p>

<h3 id="c152">上海之榨油業 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業槪況之二十九）</p>
<p>一、槪述　利用植物種子（主要為菜子棉子相子豆子類等），製成油餅，榨取其中之油質，在我　戶有悠久歷史，不過皆為手工生產，規模甚為狹小。迨至淸光緒二十一年，英商太古洋行在東北營口設立新式榨油廠以來，該業在中國始發端走人　新的階段。上海為中國最先受新式企業洗禮之都市，故翌年即有大德機器榨油廠之崛起，該廠由盛宣懷氏出資，朱志堯氏主辦，專生產棉油及棉餅。嗣后僅就上海一埠而言，繼起之新式榨油業亦頗不少，如華商之大盛，立德，同昌，大有，及洋商之增裕等廠，皆為光緒年間所創立者。當時一方因國內競爭者少，一方因東鄰日本尚未注意及此，故該業發展，頗稱順利。然為時不鐮，此種順利發展之趨勢即開始遭受挫折，其原因有二，一為國內關稅制度之不合理，一為東鄰日本起而仿效競爭。今撮述於后，以供國人參考。</p>
<p>按我國當時關稅制度，凡同一土產華商購用，除於購裝地完納正稅外，同時尚須繳納到達稅（即在到達地點所納之稅）；至洋商採辦，則僅須納稅一重，即可直接運往國外此乃不平等條約束縛之結果。當時日本方面，因科學知識比較發達，己知種種油餅（主要為棉油餅）為肥田之良品，每年從中國購用者甚夥；嗣因有鑒於油餅乃植物油子榨取后之殘物，其售價中往往包含華商對小冊子所納之兩重關稅，不若自運油子出洋製油製餅，　納一重關稅之為台稱，於是遂在該國境內開始，營新式榨油。溯自光緒二十年以后，日本之棉子榨油廠即相繼創立，對本埠民族榨油　之威脅遂日益嚴重，致閉歇與改組者繼起。此不僅因日本能自製棉油棉餅，同時我國之棉子原料，被其大量收買，以致國內廠家原料不足，亦有密切之關係。此種過去之史蹟，凡關心民族工業發展史者，皆應以注意者也。民國紀元以后，榨油業雖有發展，但其勢甚緩，迨東北失陷以后，我國之榨油為更遭受嚴重之打擊。蓋東北為大豆之集中產地，大連瀋陽之榨油業遠勝於上海，而今皆非我有矣！最近日本加强對滿洲農產之統制，同時復締結德偽商務協定，將東北之大批黃豆交換德國之軍械，使我國本埠更感受該項農產之缺乏。例如最近本埠豆腐同業議決漲價，即其反映之一。故本埠之榨油、（主要當指榨取豆油者而言）將蒙受巨大之影響，乃屬事之當然，此亦我人宜謀防範之道者也。（未完）</p>

<p>市塲祇做七月份一個月　成交尙有八百十餘萬元</p>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、六月份期貨已經停止買賣、以備二十六日交割、故市塲祇做七月份期貨一個月、市况因西南迄無就範狀况、人心慌張、惟以塲內空頭太多、逢小抵補、大有人在、因此亦稍稍引起回風、而收盤形勢、依然不振·八月份期貨、　始於今日上塲、但需除去五個月利息計算、市價當比七月份小二元半至三元、時局情形、仍需演進、債市反復尙多、昨日經過、上午開盤、市氣極虛、四號三十三號等賣氣極湧、但以吃戶太少、市價乃一致傾跌、計小四角至八角不等、各債又有新低價、次盤散戶即有補空、前列雖仍疲軟、後列已轉高三四角、午後開盤、十一及十四號等頗有抵進、七十二號亦有收回、稍稍引起回風、各債乃一律回高三四角左右、收盤繼續趨堅、再好二三角、但漲勢愈後愈弱、甲種高而復低、竟至毫無上落、故前途如時局無變化、市價縱高亦有限、否則仍當續降、市價結果、各公債衹丙種漲二角半、餘則一律絕無升降、晨跌午漲、以抵於平、成交總數、共計八百十二萬五千元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>

<p>紗市晨跌午回、局勢尙堅、盤以海外紗花市况大漲、小回頭、人氣尙堪維持、惟一般同業因紗布倉庫囤積棉紗、仍在三萬包左右、對於紗市似傾向賣方、所以壓迫亦重也、</p>

<p>標紗前市開盤、各月均呈下降之象、形勢萎疲、市塲空氣暗淡、同業均在空頭地位、漲風一過、壓力復起、市價步步下墮、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌九角至一元二·三·五角、午後開盤市態仍平庸、各月跌一·二角、但入後聞大阪三品紗近期日高、原棉轉挺、人心尙榮、迨至三收盤、各月復漲、結果各月、比上午收盤價均漲三·六·七·九角、至一元、查賣出同和二千四百包、永大一千二百包、大豐五百包、森康五百五十包、協成八百五十包、泰昌四百五十包、仁豐九百包、源大八百包、合興四百五十包、益記四百五十包、買進聚興一千二百包、明德二千五百包、長餘一千一百包、豐泰一千〇五十包、信誠一千一百五十包、達記七百包、　　七百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>— 鄭侃嬨</p>
<p>—孩子懂得自强，齊國不亡了—</p>
<p>在暮色蒼茫中，一個頭髮全白的老婦人，扶着一枝手杖，巔巍巍地靠着巷口站着。她已經站了好半天，腿也站酸了。她初出來的時候，街上行人都面露憂色，亂哄哄，一羣一羣，拖男帶女向東北走（從莒到即墨去）。她本來想問一問是否又有什麽危急的事情發生，但她一想着四面受敵的一座孤城，危急本來就是意中事，有什麽好問，便不開口了。她現在唯一的希望，就是盼她的兒子早一點回來，娘兒倆廝守着，死活也放心一些。嘈雜的街頭，不讓她有寗靜的思考。她無目的地看看這一羣，看看那一羣，還未印着很深的印象，凄麗的夕陽一抹過牆頭，眼前的印象馬上便糢糊下去。同時行人越來越少，黃昏的寂寥使她反省過去一切了。她微微的嘆息道：「唉！賈兒（是這老太太的兒子王孫賈）的爸爸還在的話，齊國想不至於這樣的。」</p>
<p>她忽然記起三十一年前（周赧王元年——公元前三一四年——）的事了——正是齊軍攻破燕國，捷報傳來那一天，齊國朝野上下發狂似的慶祝着。有些無聊的政客和淺見的軍人都說：『我們齊國走運了，我們得到燕國，說不定可以代周而興了，我們是弔民伐罪，行王道呀！』那時王孫賈的父親在齊宣王那裏做大臣，他雖然也像其他大臣一樣，上朝道賀，但他心裏總覺得有一點不安，因為他不甚向情於齊國的趁火打刦式的王道。他想替燕國人說一句公道話，無如大家都歡喜迷了，沒人聽他。他只得發呆似的站在朝班裏，谷都着嘴不說話。</p>
<p>那時恰好孟子在齊國做客卿，齊宜王很尊重他，派賈父去請他上朝商量處置燕國的大計。賈父忽忽忙忙不便說什麽，在路上只能對孟子說了這一句：「夫子，請你說句公道話罷！」孟子不明白他的心腸，還以為他說的是　面話，裝作聽不見，看也不看他一眼。因為齊國興盛日久，習於呑弱陵小，自造一種欺人的强者哲學：分明是行霸道，反說是行王道；分明是侵略人，反說是拯救人。孟子以為賈父的公道話也無非道一套，所以不理他。</p>
<p>孟子到了朝堂裏，齊王起身來迎接他，很高興的問孟子道：「我們巳經打破了燕國，把那禍國殃民的燕土噲正　了。現在有人勸我不要　燕國，又有人勸我取牠。我想，以萬乘之國伐萬乘之國，五十天居然攻下了，單靠人力是不會有這樣大成績的，恐怕是天意吧？不取必有天殃，取了牠如何？」孟子心裏想道：「好法子，王又借天意來掩飾他的暴行了！」他不好搶白齊王，只得很婉轉的答道：「如果取了牠　燕國的民衆喜歡，你就取了牠罷，古人中有一個武王也曾這樣幹過的：如果取了牠而燕國的民衆不喜歡，請你不要取，古人中有一個文王也曾這樣幹過的。」齊宣王道：「民衆喜歡不喜歡，我管不得許多了。只怕列國諸疾不許我獨呑一大國，聯合起來救燕呢。」孟子道：『「千夫所指，無病而死」何况千千萬萬的燕民？你怎能不管他們？同時列國恊約圖齊，也是可能的事。列國本來就怕齊國强，現在齊國得了兩倍的地方，如虎添翼，各國自危，怎能不聯合攻齊？齊國加想免禍，非捨燕不可，請我王多考慮一下！』孟子說完便拜辭去了。</p>
<p>賈父認為孟子所說的全是至理名言，回家轉述給他的太太賈母聽，並且加些自己的意思道：『齊國和燕國都是立國很早的，直至今日牠們還能存在，當然有牠們存在的理由。我們怎好昧於大勢，貪功好利，結怨於燕民呢？目前他們雖暫時給我們壓服，將來總有一天要起來反抗的。到了那時，齊國才糟呀！秦國本來就有併吞天下的心，楚國志向也不小，韓，趙，魏往往以秦楚的外交為外交，可靠的很少。燕禍一發，齊勢孤立，說不定會滅亡呢！』賈父不覺滴下淚來了。</p>
<p>太太忙安慰他道：「先生，齊國一定不會亡的，請你不要傷心罷！」賈父問道：「你怎見得？」太太道：「天下沒有不可預防的禍事。最怕是事前看不到，或者看到太晚，來不及預防。你如今老早便看出齊國的禍根來了。趁早從事預防，怕什麽呢？」賈父道：「我那裏不知道，不過一個人的力量有限，大家不和你合作，你就什麽也幹不來了。我們幹的是趁火打刦的事，誰也高興極了，你說這樣殺風景的話，是不會有人愛聽的。」太太道：「這可不用過慮。無論幹什麽大事，最初也不外一二個人發起，努力奮鬥，漸漸才能引人注意，得人贊助，造就成一種能助這事成功的新空氣，你何不就做這樣一個改造新空氣，喚起民衆救國的先鋒呢？」</p>
<p>賈父把太太的話記在心裏，百折不回地去幹救齊的工作。他也會勸過齊宣王收拾他那焚人自焚的侵略野心，無奈宣王不聽，反駡賈父道：「孟子是外國人，他不為齊國設想，我不怪他。你是齊國人，還說這樣風凉話，才該死呢。」官王於是疏遠贊父，實行併吞燕國。不想燕民不服，起來反抗，把齊師逐出國境。從此燕恨齊入骨，處心積慮要打入臨淄（齊國都）來報仇雪恥。齊宣王看見曹父有先見之明，漸漸也親信他了。</p>
<p>賈父很注意防燕，他常常對齊宣王說道：「燕王有勾踐報吳之志，他表面　還和我們要好心裏實在難測，我們不能不防。望我王修　內政，鞏固邊防，厚繼隣國，使燕無隙可乘，齊才可以免禍。齊國今日危機四伏，不是我們安枕的時候，我王加緊戒備罷！」宣王果然聽賈父的話，勵績圖治起來。</p>
<p>那一面燕王（噲的兒子昭王）也眞像越王勾踐，臥薪嘗膽起來了。他穿破衣，吃粗食，把錢省出來養孤恤寡，培植少壯，努力把殘破的燕國收拾好。然後卑身厚幣，招聘賢者，設法報仇。那時燕國有一個賢人叫做郭隗，燕王特地跑到他裏問計道：「齊國因為我國內亂，乘機襲破燕國。燕國人民沒一個不以此為恥辱，恨齊澈骨。我很知道燕小力少，不易報齊，但願得與賢士共國，以雪先王之恥。不知道戰國仇要怎樣才行呢？請先生指敎我！」</p>
<p>郭隗看見燕王很恭敬的親來請敎，也就坦白吿訴他道：「最要緊是得人。和帝者相處的，是他的老師；和王者相處的，是他的朋友；和覇者相處的，是他的臣下；和亡國之君相處的，是他的侍役。破除成見，謙下事人，北面受敎，比自已百倍好的人便會來了；比人先走，比人後息，先請敎而後緘默，比自己十倍好的人便會來了；別人先走，自己後隨，和自已同等的人便會來了；靠着几，扶着杖，正眼也不看，任意使人，厮役的人才肯來呢；大發脾氣，又打又駡，奴隸的人才肯來呢！——這是古時循規致士的方法。王如果眞能博選國中的賢者，朝見他們的門下，天下聽見王朝見賢臣，許多賢士一定都跑來燕國了。』昭王道：「我該去朝見誰呢？」郭隗道：『臣聞得古時有一個國君，出千金徵求一匹千里馬，三年也不能得。他的太監對他說道：『請派奴才出外徵求去！』國君便打發他去。這太監費了三個月的功夫，果然找得一匹千里馬。但可惜這匹馬已經死了，他竟出了五百金把馬骨買來向報。國君看見，非常生氣道：「我要的是活馬幹嗎，費五百金買死馬？」太監答道：「死馬還化五百金去買，何况活馬？天下賣好馬的人，一定說王能買馬，把好馬送來了。」果然等不到一年，連接有人送三匹千里馬來賣。王如今眞的要招致士人，請先從隗開始。條隗這樣不肖，王還以禮事他，何况賢於隗的人？天下賢士看見王這樣敬士，一定能不遠千里叩來了。』</p>
<p>昭王聽了郭隗的話，就築一座宮室給郭隗住，以師禮事他。天下之士聽見昭王尊賢，爭着到燕來！樂毅從魏國來，鄒衍從齊國來，劇辛從趙國來……昭王就用他們的政策，費了二十八年的功夫，把燕國治理好。於是以樂毅為上將軍，與秦楚韓趙魏合謀代齊。齊兵敗，齊閔王逃走到莒城去。燕兵追奔逐北，打入臨溜來，虜掠了齊國的寳器，焚燒了齊國的富室家廟；齊城七十多個，沒給燕兵攻下的陷，祇有莒和即墨。</p>
<p>那時賈父已經死去十多年了，他的兒子王孫賈才十五歲，齊閔王自從賈父死後，沒人警惕他，慢慢放蕩起來，不防備燕了，所以弄到一敗塗地。賈母還希望他能向憶賈父的政策，再振精神，收復失地；因此要派她的還未成年的兒子去服侍那亂離失勢的國王。</p>
<p>她只有王孫賈一個兒子，還是四十多歲才養下來的，她當然會比其他的母親更加愛惜兒子了。如果她不是愛國的話，她怎捨得差這樣小的一個兒子去當危難的大任呢？她决定使兒出任那一天，兒子還不知道。他早上起來，還披着一頭短髮，穿上一身窄袖短腿的小孩衣褲，對母親請了早安，便回書室念書去了。賈母看見兒子瘦小的背影忍不住淚下如雨，默默的想道：『有用的人（指賈父）偏偏短命死了，留下這樣一個不够斤兩的小鷄，濟什麽事！他長得又特別比人瘦小。親戚們都說我功課緊，把兒子逼壞了。如果他們知道我今日要他放下書包，在重圍下的孤城裏，拚死衛國，他們不知道又怎樣說我了。唉！顧不得許多了，難道我愛我的兒子還不如人嗎？他們那裏有我替他想得週到。凡有一點血性的人，寗死不肯做亡國奴的，何况我的兒子？他是虎子，他是獅兒，他要跳出來吞噬他的仇人；他不能像豬一樣，縮在圈裏，讓人屠殺………』她想到這裏，勇氣百倍，她自己也　馬上變成年輕力壯了。她連手杖也不扶，健步走進藏衣室去，拿出賈父的朝衣，縮了幾寸，勉强和兒子穿起來。</p>
<p>賈母一面替兒子束髮，一面敎訓兒子道：『兒，國家給燕國欺侮得不成樣子了，土地幾乎給人家搶盡，人民不知道殺死多多少少如果我們還不齊心反抗，收服失地，我們便要做亡國奴了』。王孫賈忙道：『媽，我不能做亡國奴！』賈母道：『是呀！你不能做亡國奴，我也不能做亡國奴，所有齊國人都不能做亡國奴。就是因為這個緣故，我要你出來救國了。國家急於用你，來不及等你成人了。』王孫賈道：『媽，我已經成人了，請你不要老是把我當小孩般看待。其實有什麽大人小孩，能幹大事的便是大人，否則就是一百歲，我也說他是個小孩。——媽，你不曾看過狼和羊嗎？狼比羊小，可是羊一聽見狼聲，便嚇到不能動，讓狼吞噬了。怎能以大驕人，以小自棄呢？』賈母聽見兒子的話，很高興的道：『孩子懂得自强，齊國不亡了！齊國不亡了！』</p>
<p>王孫賈出去做事，每日朝出晚歸。賈母因為愛子心切，午飯一吃完，便走出巷口來等候她的兒子。她天天總要站幾個時辰才盼到兒子回來。有時消息惡劣，她掛着兒子不放心，往往早上送兒子出去，不回來，一直站等着一天。鄰近的人看慣了，遠遠看着她的影子，便認得是她了。這一天有一位消息靈通的王老爹，看見天快黑了，賈母還在巷口站着，曉得她的兒子還未回來，很替她擔心。</p>
<p>原來　幾天，楚國恨燕國分贓不平，特地派淖齒督着大軍到莒，名為救齊，實則想用武力迫燕國和楚國平分齊國的土地和據掠得來的寳物。齊閔王不知道淖齒的奸謀，開門讓他進莒城來。最初幾天他還假意和齊王談些攻守之計，後來他竟不客氣把齊王殺了。這個消息傳出，有些膽小的齊人怕在莒不能立足，紛紛逃到即墨去。王孫賈因為不知情，齊王被殺的一天，他還依舊上朝。王老爹怕賈母憂慮，不敢把實情吿訴他，只問道：『老太太，賈哥兒還未回來嗎？』</p>
<p>『王老爹，不知因為什麽緣故，這樣晚賈兒還未回來。——有什麽不好的消息？』賈母問。</p>
<p>王老爹忍不住洩露一點消息，說：『聽說楚國派來的淖齒為難（他不敢說「殺了」）我們的國王，說不定朝裏有事，哥兒今晚不能回來了。老太太還是回家歇歇罷。』</p>
<p>賈母覺得王老爹的話有理，道了謝，慢慢地走回來。才到家，王係賈也踉踉蹌蹌的趕回來了。賈母忙問道：『齊王呢？』王孫賈怕母親難受，也不敢說實話，呑呑吐吐的說道：『唔，您問王？唔——王不知道上那裏去了，兒找了一天還找不着他，因怕您關心，所以先回來看看。』賈母生氣道：『你這沒出息的孩子，你回來幹什麽？』她氣到說不出話來，過了一會，才繼續說道：　『你事王，王出走，你不知道王在那裏，怎可以回來呢！我從前以為你是一個好孩子，知道盡忠行義，所以我特別愛你，你朝出晚歸，我必定到大門口去等你；你晚上出外未回，我必定到巷口去等你。近來因為國事緊急，我更掛念你了，無論你早出晚出，我都老早站在巷口等你。早知你是這樣沒出息的，我何必在你身上多費心呢。』</p>
<p>王孫賈聽見母親的責言，忙跪下解釋道：『兒那裏是這樣忘忠背義的？無奈朝臣都給綽齒買通了，沒一個可以商量的………』賈母不等兒子說完，便駁他道：『你眞不懂事，你還想和朝臣商量救君救國嗎？他們若是好人，國家不會弄到這樣糟了。我敢說，今日在上位的多是類乎奸細的，可靠的人很少，你還不到民間去找眞正的愛國義士嗎？齊人是優秀民族，一定有許多有血性的人。你如能招集他們來，恢復齊國也不難呢』。</p>
<p>王孫賈拜別了母親，馬上又進城去。到了城牆下，守城的兵士因為天黑，不肯開鬥。他怕又激惱了母親，不敢回家，站在城　下過了一夜。天明城開了，他便跑到市上號召羣衆去。他得到一個宰牛的屠夫的允許，讓他高高站在肉欀上演說。他大聲說道：『諸位伯叔姑姊，我們齊國人，給外國人欺侮到沒法再忍受了。……」衆人看見王孫賈小人穿着大人衣，一頂紗帽掩過了眉毛，衣領接着帽簷，露出了半塊小小的白臉，　把一個猴子打扮起來一樣，　都忍不住笑了。等到聽見他說出國家受侮的事，大家才正經起來，停止了一切買賣，圍近來垂手恭聽了。王孫賈繼續說下去道：「國家有七十多個城，都給燕國搶去了，只剩下莒和即墨。我們要靠這兩個城做根據地，來恢復失地，不想現在又受制於楚。自從淖齒進了莒城來，莒便不是齊國的了。今兒淖齒又把我們的國王殺了。如果我們不殺淖齒，齊國復興無望了！………』大衆忍着眼淚跳起來道：『殺淖齒去！殺淖齒去！』王孫賈又道『是呀，我打算就去殺淖齒，你們有願和我一塊去的，請解衣露出右臂來』！</p>
<p>於是全市四百多人，連王孫賈也在內，都露出右臂，有刀的拿刀，有棍的拿棍，一齊殺人淖齒的營裏去把他斬首示衆。楚兵殺的殺，逃的逃，降的降，一時便把莒城恢復了。遠近的齊人聽見這個勝利的消息，都磨拳擦掌，躍躍欲試。不久田單在即墨起義響應，很快便恢復了整個的齊國，這全靠莒城這次的民族革命來激勵士氣。</p>
<p>革命成功那一天，大事完畢，民衆簇擁着王孫賈回家拜母。賈母站在巷口來迎接他們。大衆歡呼震天，把賈母樂到流出淚來了，</p>

<p>呂淑湘譯　一元五角</p>
<p>星期標準書　商務版</p>
<p>羅維（Robcrt　HeinrichLowie　1883—？）是當代人類學」中的一個溫和的學者，他硏究的地區，雖止限於美洲，但是他蒐集的材料，至為繁多，印刋的著述，也是不少。他以冷靜的頭腦，科學的眼光，去分析事物，不為一切過去的學說所囿，而有所建樹與發明。更不目視為文明的部族，是人間驕子，因而輕視同時代的文化落後的部族。因此而有「初民社會」（Primitive　Society）1920)與「我們文明嗎？」（Ae　We　Civilizen,1929）的出版。「我們是文明嗎」，可以使我們了解我們目前日常的生活，習俗，正有許多來自原人的，因而再也不敢去輕視我們同時代的文化落後的民族了。這書，我們中國的名學者周作人先生曾經說過，可以不容贅言。「初民社會」呢？簡直是一部絕好的書，雖然出版已在十六年前，共　值仍是高貴的。尤其是事政「民族學」「人類學」的人，對於這本以冷靜的頭腦，平允的眼光，去叙述初民社會的眞情，實况，縷舉初民社會文化底歷程的因子，批評，「進化派」的學說的無當的一本簡明曉暢的好書，實非好好的把牠細讀不可的。</p>
<p>誰都知道進化派的學說過去在我們中國的勢力，誰都知道　爾根（L.H.Morgan）的巨著『古代社會（Anoieot　Society）的在我們中國的勢力，是被視為圭　般的天經地義。其實，這是大大地不然的。摩氏的書，是一八七七年出版的，那時「人類學」「民族學」的研究，還未甚光明。他以進化派的觀點為原　，將原始社會的種種複雜情形，不分黑白的包括起來，歸納在簡單的方式中，更以此論列一切初民文化，求其一點的相同，棄其大部份的　異割裂文化，蔑視全貌，强把許多文化歷程跟因子不同的初民文化混於一堆，納在同一的型式之中，這怎能認為有當呢？</p>
<p>我們該知道，「假定」不是不可能的，但須種種的條件齊備。「排比」也行，不能以偶然的現象為根據。「文化」掘地層的有一定的先後，層次，可依據以發現初民文化建設歷程的。「文化」是有機體，有許多表面相同的現象，而不是同原因　造而成。反之，固原因的文化因素，可發生一種或二種以上不同的現象。我們怎能執其一而以例其餘？還有，有的文化偶然相同，是基於初民心理之相同；或僅某一小點的相同。若不願他的地理環境，時間空間的關係，平心靜氣的去尋找他的來源，硬以一小點的相同而謂其全同，更由是而以為其同型論列之，這眞是武斷極了。還有，文化過程的不同，是因其文化背景而有異，不一定是每一世紀進展到某一同樣的田地；更不一定是同循某一路徑而行。以偶然的發現，硬謂「母權社會」必先於「父權社會」，這是不可能的。天下事，大多不可逆料，以簡單的型式去統一至為複雜的初民社會，初民文化，凖要鬧笑話的。文化進展的歷程，是脫不掉地理環境的。以此，其進程有遲緩急速之分，且有榨而不前或退後的一例。路徑的各別，不盡由於一途，更是不消伸說了。能以「進化派」的眼光和手法去處理，怎會得着合乎實際情形的偉大發明？</p>
<p>羅維氏審愼地羅舉各種初民社會的制度，風俗，信仰，旁徵博引地以曉暢的筆墨去揭發摩爾根的說法的缺點，這是能够令人信服的。他一章章的檢　摩爾根的鍜誤，根據事實，使之還其本來面目，不　頗，不武斷，，使讀者一目瞪然，不獨感覺着他的舉問的淵博，也同樣的感覺着他的見解高明。他說：「現在的人類學者，已發現了許多新的智識，新的方法，這摩爾根，偉著，已　為「古　」。細讀「初民社會」一過，羅維氏此言，實是實話，並非自誇，也非深自期許的汚衊前賢！</p>
<p>這一書中，各章都有無量數的例證，明白暢曉地叙述出來，以證明「進化派」的無當，以建立他自已以「文化」解釋「文化」，以「文化歷史」及「文化環境」解釋過去的文化歷程，現在文化狀况的主張，周詳審愼，精博俱備，說是一本值得推薦的書。</p>
<p>自然，本書的首末二章是泛論「民族學」「人類學」，但這中的論列，正足以看出著者的主張，反視「進化派」的「演化論」及「傳播論」的缺點，於初學斯道的人，實是二章非常重要的文字，最宜慢慢的把牠細讀下去的。後半關於社會組織的各章，周詳精細，材料豐富，叙述明確，允為全書之精彩部份，筆者是非常誠懇的介紹給各位讀者。</p>

<p>陳騤，南宋臨海人，字叔進，紹興中舉進士第一。光宗時，做吏部侍郞。寗宗時，知樞密院事兼參政知事。他做的官不算小，後來因為得罪了韓侂冑，因此免官。他著得「南宋館閣錄」和「文則」兩部書，而「文則」就是他論文的一部大作。</p>
<p>「文則」道一部書，現在沒有單行本，收在台州叢書裏面。他這書的內容大半是討論文章修辭方面的事，而尤以丙丁兩篇裏面，說得最詳細，最完備。</p>

<p>第一，是直喩。他說：「一曰直喩，或言猶，或言若，或言如，或言似，灼然可見。」幷且舉「緣木求魚十，「朽素　六馬」，一譬如北辰，衆星拱之「做例子。</p>
<p>第二，是　喩。他說：「二曰隱喩，其文雖隱，　則可尋。」幷且舉「　　歷，焉避之」（　語），是　吳也夫」（左傳）做例子。</p>
<p>第三，是類喩。他說：「三曰類喩，取其一類，以次喩之。幷且舉「天子如堂羣臣如陛，衆庶如地」（賈誼新書）做例子。</p>
<p>第四，是詰喩。他說：「四曰訪喻，雖為喩文，似成語難。」這種　問的力量最大，幷且舉「虎兕出於　龜玉毀於櫝中，是誰之過歟？」（論語）「人之有牆，以避惡也。牆之隙壞，誰之咎也？」「左傳」做例子。</p>
<p>第五，是對喩。他說：「五曰對喩，先比後正，上下相符。」幷且舉「魚相忘於江湖，人想忘於道衛」（荘子），「流丸止於甌臾，流言止於知者」（荀子）做例子。</p>
<p>第六，是博喩。他說：「六曰博喩，取以為喩，不一而足。」幷且舉「若金，用汝作礪；若濟巨川，用汝作舟楫；若歲大旱用汝作霖雨」（書經），「猶以指側河也，猶以戈春黍也，猶錐飱壺也」做例子。</p>
<p>第七，是簡喩。他說：「七曰簡喩，其文雖略，其義甚明。」幷且舉一名，德之輿也」（左傳），「仁，宅也」（法言）做例子。</p>
<p>第八，是詳喩。他說：「八曰詳喩，須假多辭，然後義顯。」幷且舉「夫耀蟬者務在乎明其火振其樹而已，火不明，雖振其樹，無益也；今人主有能明其德，則天下歸之，猶蟬之歸火也。」（荀子）做例子。</p>
<p>第九，是引喩。他說：「九曰引喻，援取前言，以證其事。」幷且舉「諺所謂庇焉而縱尋斧者也」（左傳）「蛾子時術之，其此之謂乎」（禮記）做例子。</p>
<p>第十，是虛喩。他說：「十曰虛喩，旣不指物，亦不指事。」幷且舉「其言似不足者」（論語），「　今似無所止」（老子）做例子。</p>
<p>上面所舉的十條，第三類喻，第六搏喩，第八詳喩，第十虛喩，這四種都是直喩的變形，不能單獨成功一類；還有第五對喩，第七簡喻，也只是隱喩的變化，不能獨立；這些地方，不能不說他有犯重複的毛病。誠如四庫全書總提要所云：</p>
<p>分門別類，頗嫌於太瑣太拘，亦不免舍大而求細。（未完）</p>

<p>— 劉志民醫師</p>
<p>靑年血氣方剛。情欲最易衝動。偶一失檢。不惟失却健康。卽生機幸福。子嗣壽命。亦均受其影響。可不懼哉。</p>
<p>手淫為靑年最易犯之惡癖。暗室自凟。十有八九。戕伐生機。耗喪精元。至巨且烈。每致引起遺精腎萎早洩等等性病。不知犧牲多少人之幸福也。</p>
<p>患者李君。年三十二歲。湖南人。在紗廠任要職。因幼年誤犯手淫。致身體無從發育。且患失眠遺精。百計調理。全無效騐。延醫服藥。亦無影響。身體慚形瘦削。目眶內陷。面色慘淡。今春由林祖賢君。介紹來余處診治。經余用囑向五洲藥房購服「希米脫氏固精片」治其遺精。「生殖素」以培補調理之。血氣漸呈充盈。肌肉漸形發達。前後五星期左右從未失眠遺精。諸症消失。發育壯健。為從來所未有。最近接李君自長沙來信。謂自別後返鄉。身强體壯。未有一病，且云其夫人已懷孕數月云。</p>

<p>本症病源。或由於肺結核。或由於梅毒。或由於瘧疾。或由於傷寒痢疾。或由於手術及外傷之失血。以致血少血淡。血枯血淡。顏面蒼黃。唇色慘白。精神萎頓。肌肉消瘦。健康旣失。百病雜呈。若不早治。終至萎死。</p>
<p>患者何君。罹有惡性貧血症。迭經醫治。迄無起色。身日瘦削。衰弱症象迭起。今春由其族兄介紹。來余處診治。經余投用「生殖素」。血液漸見濃郁。面色唇色。均轉紅潤。血氣充盈。肌肉發達。宿恙全消。壯健逾恒云。</p>

<p>風濕內蘊。餘毒入骨。其始先現骨節痠痛。如延不治療。卽增劇成為四肢麻木不仁。更劇則半身不遂。全體瘓癱。行動失自由。等於殘廢矣。</p>
<p>去冬有患者韋君來訴有風濕骨痛。手足麻木等症。迭治未效。余診得韋君且係餘毒未掙所致。卽囑向五洲藥房購服「强斯登氏骨痛片」。袪風濕。搜餘毒。骨節卽感舒暢。手足亦形靈活。連服數盒。克奏根治奇效。欣欣稱謝而去云</p>

<p>花柳惡症。以白濁為最頑固難治。蓋白濁病源菌係一種淋病雙球菌。（或稱重球菌）自不潔之性交染來。先在前尿道作祟。現腫脹。刺痛之苦。繼入後尿道及內部織巧組織。據粘膜為護膜。形成種種險症。不惟絕嗣滅育。抑且傷身促壽。</p>
<p>本症治法。殺菌為主。殺菌之劑。以黃色素最奏特效。然黃色素注射劑。用後往往有色素沉着於腠理及惹起發炎等之流弊。最近科學發達。醫學昌明。迭經研究改良。始有黃色素內服製劑之發現。用後與注射黃色素有異曲同工之妙。而無其種種副作用之流弊。</p>
<p>患者卜君。年三十二歲。早年因誤涉花叢。致染淋濁。迭服市售廉價藥多種。非僅無效。且失去易治病機。轉成頑痼慢性。纏綿荼毒。困苦難言。今春始由其同鄉方君介紹來診。為經濟起見。經余囑向太和藥房購服黃色素製劑「安敵淋」以自療。幸藥力直達患部。滲透粘膜。連服數盒。炎消腫退。菌滅濁凈。生機重復。得慶更生云。</p>

<h3 id="c205">漢口救濟會擴大組織 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 方九</p>
<p>漢口市政府，以該市救濟事業，現已舉辦者，雖設有救濟委員會，及貧民借貸處等機關辦理。惟以救濟事業，依照規定，不止一端，舉凡老弱矜恤，臨時遣送，舉辦冬賑等等，均屬切要。措施設有遺漏，殊非政府一視同仁之旨。刻為兼籌幷顧，以期普惠窮黎起見，决將現設之漢市救濟委員會，擴大組織。會內分設歸女，乞丐，殘廢，孤兒，育嬰，貸欵六所。其他六項救濟事業，亦悉由該會辦理，俾一事權，幷特別注意貧民貸欵，扶助其自謀生計，以期市面安定，</p>
<p>本來，俗語有云：「救急不救窮」，「救窮確是件非常困難的事，尤其在目下我們的大好河山迭遭敵人的蹂躪，而農村的破產，似乎在「復興農村」的口號之下，絲毫未曾有所成　，漢口市政府的救濟委員會的擴大，乃不無其根源可追究出來的。</p>
<p>漢市救濟會的擴大組織，在表面看來，覺得窮黎的普惠，確是件非常可喜的事，凡有菩薩的心腸的，都為窮黎祝福，認為自是窮黎可减少，社會可安定。說不定「安居樂業」，「繁榮經濟」，自是可得而就矣。然而依照實際的觀察，漢市救濟會的擴大組織，正表現漢市不安的隱憂也。蓋救濟會的組織儘管擴大，而窮黎的大批製出，很可能使救濟會的擴大組織變成為不算大的組織的。</p>
<p>我們眼見街頭上的乞丐，日見增多，考其來源，有自災區農村逃荒而來，有因失業無以為生而出。其他如婦女（為娼之婦女），殘廢，孤兒，棄嬰，等等，無一不由社會經濟之破產而出者。所以「救濟會」的擴大雖然必要，然而更「必要」者，要使「繁榮市面」，「復興農村」等口號，非澈底堅决實現不可！</p>
<p>至於貧民借貸，我們上海過去也曾舉辦過，然而條件苛刻，如非有舖保不可，試問窮人還有誰家舖子信任他？因此貧民借貸，只是使貧民「望洋興難」而已！這點，也深切盼望舉辦貧民借貸的諸善士，加以注意。</p>
<h3 id="c206">曬台上 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 長風</p>
<p>早上被一種敲擊的聲音驚醒，天氣又熱起來了，想着早一點起身也好，就趿了拖鞋到曬台上去盥洗。惟開房門，面前堆着許多木料和鉛皮，兩個木匠在曬台上工作，二房東高高地站在到曬台去梯級上，似乎在指揮一切。他見我出來，笑着問了早，又吿訴我要在曬台搭一個閣，預備堆積一些破舊的東西。上海的二房東幾乎都便靠着頂一所石庫門下來做營業的，曬台上搭着閣樓出租也是常有的事。我祇隨意應和着，「很好！很好！」雖然搭了閣樓之後，至少對於我這三層樓三房客要减少許多便利的地方，不過我搬進來時候公共的客堂現在巳舖成了他們的臥室，曬台上要搭一個閣做三房客的自然沒有反對的理由。</p>
<p>晚上回來，兩個木匠剛收拾完畢，一個鉛皮頂的閣已經搭起來了，它剛剛遮蓋了我臥室後面的光綫。我就踏上梯級去觀望一下，那曬台還留出裝有自來水龍頭的一角。我沒有妻室，衣服都是送進洗衣作的，祗要自來水龍頭留着對於我還是便利的。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>好像是一星期之後吧，早上我到曬台去盥洗的時候發現閣裏住着一份人家，是夫妻兩個和一個孩子。那男的很客氣地向我招呼，他問我是住在三層樓的？恐怕是孩子吵鬧把先生吵驚了。那男子說話很和氣，好像很抱歉的樣子。我吿訴他我本來起身很早的，就放了一面盆冷水回到房裏。那天下樓，二房東又故意攔住我向我聲明了：</p>
<p>「曬台上搬來一份人家了。是朋友介紹來的，因為房子都住滿了，就把曬台租給他們，，我的東西還堆在樓梯脚呢！」</p>
<p>說着他指點我看樓梯下的一堆破東西，好像曬台上的鉛皮閣他沒有要借人家的意思，而是朋友的情面難却而借的。走了出來。</p>
<p>幾天之後，我和曬台上漸漸相熟了，夫妻兩個做人，都是很好的，他們恐怕我汲水不便，時常替我把房門外的鉛桶裏注滿了水。那男的幾次三番，向二房東探聽我是吾否惡他們，有時候也到我房裏來談天了。</p>
<p>他們兩個都在附近一家香烟廠裏做工的，女的做日班，男的做夜班，但是有時兩個人不能交替的時候，就把孩子鎖在房裏。有一次他送了我許多烟捲，是從廠裏帶回來的，他說自已不會抽烟，放着也是霉爛掉。據說烟廠裏是有這個規矩的，每一個職工每月有多少烟捲贈送。那些工友都廉價售給烟兌店賺一份意外的進益。所以我知道「放着也是霉爛掉」是他推託之辭，我願意把那些烟捲照市價售給我，但是他不肯收我的錢。而第二個月的烟捲又送給我了。我旣沒法推辭，就買一點糖菓，表料送給他們的孩子，他是千恩萬謝的。</p>
<p>二房東本來怕我和那些下等人住不慣要退租，現在知道我們感情很好，他也時常上三樓來凑一脚了。說我是個好房客，他們夫妻也是很好的，出門人都要人家帮忙的，彷彿多嘴的媒客似的。</p>
<p>廬施福，陳傳霖的第二屆攝影合展，自二十日起，在大　公司四樓舉行。左為陳君所　。</p>
<p>的做日班沒有回來，男的照例鎖了門上夜班去了。在房門口遇到我，他很高興地吿訴我：「廠裏要出一批定貨，他媽去做了日夜班。多添一班工錢是加倍的，可惜添班的時候不多。」孩子似的跳着下樓去了。</p>
<p>那天半夜裏我被很大的聲音吵醒了，同時有人在敲我的房門，是二房東的聲音。我披了衣服出來，一股熱氣炙着我，曬台上有許多人在那裏敲着鉛皮，原來閣裏起了火，因為是鉛皮屋頂，火勢不能冒出來，還是對樓人家看見那個小窗裏的火光喊起來的。但是許多人擠在曬台角上沒有方法拆屋，又沒有方法灌救。到救火車來用斧頭打開那閣的時侯，裏面已經什麽都沒有了。</p>
<p>我望着那焦臭的火堆，想着那個活潑的孩子，那兩個在廠裏做夜工的夫妻，！那一對善良的夫妻。彷彿失了知覺似的靠在自己房門口到薰烟完全停熄了才感到微微有點凉意，天色已快將黎明了。</p>

<p>初雪之夜</p>
<p>在一個初冬的雪夜裹，老爺少奶奶等正幸福地在溫暖的燈光下享樂着；但他們的窗外，也正展開了一幕大衆的現實的生活——</p>
<p>時局正緊張恐怖得極，街頭高堆起沙袋，兵士們穿着皮鞋，荷着槍，準備為保衛民族和眞理而犧牲。這時，失業的窮人以及小販也正為了生活，不得不迎風站在牆角，深深地嘆息和憤忿着。</p>
<p>何老三是一個失業工人，奔跑了一天，借到二元錢；他現在站在街角上，等着另一個肯借錢給他的朋友。一面，他懊念着家裏飢餓着的老婆孩子。他的身傍站着流浪的余先生，一個無處去的文人。於是二人談起來了，交流着被壓迫者們眞誠的同情。</p>
<p>十字街頭眞是一個充滿生活知識的大衆學校；賣餛飩的訴着他受到經濟恐慌所影響到的苦處；小偷講述他生活的方法…………</p>
<p>一個落難的貧女，因為關外成了亡國的事實，敵人奪去了他們的安樂，所以流浪到揚子江的海濱來，同着她的老父，乞食度日。然而，都市裏大家也正喊着活不下，咀嚼着貧窮的宿費，被旅舘店夥將他的老父扣起來了。</p>
<p>貧女向銀行家哀苦地乞討，但得到的祇是無情的厭惡。貧女被飢寒壓迫，暈倒在地上了。何老三看不過，本能地將借到的一元錢替貧女還了欠債。但何老三却失去了買餛飩的錢。總於得到賣餛飩的同情，免費給何老三和余先生吃了餛飩。</p>
<p>道時，賣唱者們徬徨到這十字街頭來。其中賣唱甲是是唱麒麟派京戲的好手：賣唱者乙是一個落泊的聲樂家，因太太小姐們不了解藝術，故也弄得沒飯吃，流落成賣唱者甲的助手。賣唱者乙被余先生發覺是多年前的老友，於是大家交換着嘆息。</p>
<p>何老三終於等不着朋友，而他的老婆却憂急地趕來，訴着沒錢付房錢和小孩沒得吃的苦衷。她要硬拉他回家，因為敵人將實行他們獸性的大屠殺。</p>
<p>但他們意料不到敵人立刻兇暴地衝過來了。連老爺少奶奶們也意料不到，仍在狂跳着醉心的舞，唱着桃色的歌曲。</p>
<p>最後，大衆為了要生存，為了不願做非人的亡國奴，就聯合了兵士，奮勇地為眞理而抗戰。</p>

<p>淡雲微雨春釀濃。拋　閒愁上滴翠亭。滿目芳菲啼鳥歇。忽見那，一雙蝴蝶逐香塵。翩翩絕似花團錦。高下渾如鳥入林。他是，風定偶然捎燕子。嬉水時欲學蜻蜓那寳釵是，手携紈扇輕輕拍。但見那，袖微擅香汗零。穿過畫廊廊九曲。分花柳越留神。正在那，欲擒忽縱嗟無及。忽聽得，絮語喁喁隔水聞。那寳釵是，機警向來能詐變。沁芳橋行過却逡巡。高聲故把顰兒叫。他是，移禍江東怕殺身。驀地忽聞窗福啟。他便揚聲緩向水邊跨。小紅一聽非常急。從此日後向瀟湘種禍根。虧他煞費一番心。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The National Salvation Comrades Association of various counties and cities in Guangdong telegraphed the Central Government, requesting sanctions against the abnormal movements in Guangdong and Guangxi. The original telegram is recorded below: To the Nanjing Central News Agency for public information. Recently, we sent a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Military Affairs Commission, which read: (Omitted titles) Unfortunately, the Party and the nation are suffering from frequent disasters and rebellions. All Chinese people should unite sincerely and jointly save the nation from peril. However, a few generals in Guangdong and Guangxi, under the guise of resisting Japan and saving the country, are undermining peace and unification. Despite repeated warnings from the Central Government and the highest military leaders, they continue to act willfully and conspire to rebel. Upon hearing this, we are deeply grieved and indignant. At this time of national crisis and popular distress, if local generals are allowed to act freely, the effect of saving the nation will not be seen, but the danger of disintegration will appear first. If, unfortunately, this leads to another round of warfare, plunging the nation and the people into an irrecoverable abyss, who will be the culprit and who will bear the responsibility? We earnestly request the central Party, government, and military authorities to make a decisive decision and no longer tolerate this. They should immediately and strictly order the dissenting generals to retire from public life and apologize to the people. This association, on behalf of the 30 million true people of Guangdong, pledges to be the Central Government's backing, etc. In addition to sending separate telegrams, we hereby report this by telegram. Respectfully, the National Salvation Comrades Association of various counties and cities in Guangdong, Hao (19th), stamped. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>

This measure is being discussed between Beijing and Guangdong and will soon be implemented. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Since the Song-Han-Ma telegram was sent, Chiang has replied, expressing sympathy for Song and Han's advocacy of peaceful resolution. The Southwest side also sent a reply to Tianjin.

<p>(Tianjin) Japanese Consul Kishi Ichi called on Xu Liya, Customs Superintendent of Tianjin, at 2 PM on the 24th to lodge a written protest regarding the Darong Maru case in Qikou on the 20th. The protest contained two points: 1. Insulting the Japanese national flag. 2. Firing on an unarmed vessel.

<p>(Tianjin) Within the next day or two, the Consulate General will issue an official document to the Tianjin Customs regarding the Darong Maru incident, demanding compensation, an apology, and guarantees for the loss of life, damage to the ship, etc., suffered by the Japanese side. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The news that the Japanese freighter Darong Maru was fired upon by a customs patrol vessel after departing Qingdao on Sunday has been confirmed today by the Japanese consular authorities here. It is reported that the Darong Maru was fired upon while drifting in dense fog a few miles from Qikou. Four crew members were injured. Customs sailors boarded the Darong Maru, threw the Japanese flag into the sea, and hoisted the customs flag instead. The Japanese flag was later found with nine bullet holes. Japanese military spokesman Ishii stated when meeting with reporters from Chinese newspapers yesterday that the Qikou incident was caused by a misunderstanding. At the time, the Japanese vessel mistakenly identified the customs patrol vessel as a pirate ship, leading to an exchange of fire. Customs authorities have visited the Japanese consular authorities, and both sides are studying a peaceful solution regarding the damage to the ship and injuries to the crew.

<p>(Tianjin) An Si'er returned to Tianjin after inspecting anti-smuggling efforts on the Pinghan Railway. On the 24th, he revisited Xu Liya, Commissioner of Tianjin Customs, and the authorities of the Beining and Jinpu Railways to discuss ways to prohibit southward smuggling by Japanese trading associations. He plans to visit Han in Jinan on the evening of the 25th to seek cooperation and return to Beijing before the 28th to preside over the establishment of an inspection branch. Currently, there are an increasing number of Japanese trading associations and smuggling firms in Tianjin. Every night, they forcibly transport southward smuggled goods, averaging over 1,000 tons. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to estimates by the Tianjin Office of the Jinpu Railway from the 1st to the 24th, due to Japanese forcibly occupying the No. 305 and No. 78 passenger trains bound for the south to load smuggled goods, passenger ticket revenue has decreased by over 100,000 yuan. The losses have been particularly severe in the past week, with each train losing approximately 2,000 yuan. Customs investigations reveal that the recent smuggled goods arriving in Tianjin by sea are mostly fruits and seafood. The goods are transported by sailing ships, with approximately 40 to 50 ships connected stern to stern each time. They are all unloaded on the coast of eastern Hebei or outside Dagu, protected by armed Japanese, making it impossible to stop them. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Shipping industry sources report that the Tianjin-Shanghai route has been affected by rampant smuggling. The volume of domestic goods and European and American transshipment goods shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin has decreased significantly, especially freight between Hong Kong and Tianjin, which has almost ceased. In the past, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had as many as 20 ships sailing back and forth each week. Currently, Taikoo and Jardine Matheson have each reduced to two ships, and China Merchants has one ship. Northern shipping routes are nearing their end. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Tashiro came to Beiping yesterday to represent the Japanese Emperor in presenting flags to the troops stationed in Beiping, Tongzhou, and Fengtai. This morning, he met with military and civilian officials stationed in Beiping to inquire about everything. Tashiro, having completed his mission in Beiping, returned to Tianjin in the afternoon with his entourage and staff officer Iida. Japanese Embassy Military Attaché Imai stated that Tashiro's visit was solely for the purpose of presenting flags to the troops and had no other mission. Therefore, he did not visit various parties. The report that Tashiro went to Tongxian this morning may be a mistake. Brigade Commander Kawabe has gone to the vicinity of Tianjin to inspect the troops under his command. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Accompanied by the Japanese Army Ministry's flag presentation envoy, Tashiro went to Tongxian by car on the morning of the 24th to hold a flag presentation ceremony for the Japanese troops stationed there. He returned to Beiping at 11 AM and immediately visited various authorities for courtesy calls. He then departed for Tianjin by car at 1 PM. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tashiro inspected Japanese troops at the Japanese training ground on Dongchang'an Street yesterday morning. A cordon was temporarily established, prohibiting pedestrians and vehicles from passing. As a result, traffic on Dongchang'an Street and Chongwenmen Avenue was completely cut off. At one point, the wife of a certain French battalion commander was walking on the sidewalk on Chongwenmen Avenue and was pushed down by a Japanese soldier. The woman believed that the sidewalk was outside the cordon and therefore walked on it again, only to be pushed down again by a Japanese soldier. The French Embassy in Beiping believes that this action by the Japanese soldiers was inappropriate and has lodged a protest with the Japanese Embassy. At the same time, a U.S. military officer was also pushed down while walking on the sidewalk and stabbed with a knife. The U.S. Embassy has also lodged a protest. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tashiro completed his mission in Beiping and returned to Tianjin with his staff at 4 PM on the 24th. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The scope of discussion at the Supervisory Commissioners' Meeting includes a review of the work of the various Supervisory Commissioners' Offices over the past year, the direction of work for 1935, and methods of changing expenditures and organizations. According to a certain committee member, the central issue of the current meeting is to change the organization. The initial budget for each Supervisory Commissioner's Office was set at 7,800 yuan. However, due to the state treasury's financial difficulties, the scope was reduced. Currently, due to insufficient funds, progress is difficult. Therefore, it is proposed to restore the original budget of 7,800 yuan. After a decision is made and reviewed by the President of the Control Yuan, it will be submitted to the Central Government for approval. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<h3 id="e22">Profit and Loss of Postal, Telecommunications, Aviation Administration in 1935 <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The first half of the year ended at the end of the month. The profits and losses of the postal, telecommunications, aviation, and civil aviation businesses under the Ministry of Communications' jurisdiction for 1935 are roughly as follows: A. The telecommunications sector: 1. Thirteen international wireless telegraph lines were opened, and business is quite good, with a surplus of approximately 6-7 million yuan. 2. The wireless telegraph sector's revenue and expenditure are average. 3. The wired telegraph sector, due to high circuit operating costs and many new circuit construction projects, coupled with the failure to clear overdue payments from the military and the continued amortization of old debts, has accumulated a total loss of 10 million yuan. B. The postal sector: Business is average. Due to the heavy expenditure on building construction and new postal routes, it is estimated that there may be a property surplus. C. The aviation administration sector: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has gradually improved after business reorganization, but the debt is too heavy and the interest burden is particularly large. In addition, property values have plummeted, and the value of the original warehouses and land has gradually declined, resulting in a significant capital deficit. D. The postal aviation sector: 1. The China National Aviation Corporation's (CNAC) business is extremely developed, but the heavy expenditure on purchasing large aircraft and building stations and radio equipment is significant. Roughly, there is only a surplus in assets. 2. The Eurasia Aviation Corporation's profits are meager due to too few routes, coupled with the fact that the operating lines are not as critical as CNAC, therefore there are deficits that are still compensated for by postal subsidies from the Ministry of Communications.

<h3 id="e24">The Two Major Issues of the Present <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— Year</p>
<p>Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British economic envoy, recently issued a lengthy farewell speech. While some points, such as his statement on the attitude of the Japanese authorities towards China's tariff issue and his discussion of China's reduction of import tariff rates, are debatable, the good intentions of the entire article are deeply felt. We are particularly touched by the two issues of Chinese security and the special situation in North China mentioned by Sir Frederick. Please elaborate.</p>
<p>Sir Frederick Leith-Ross said, "The future of China's currency and even its entire financial standing will depend, first, on the maintenance of security in the Chinese interior, and second, on the resolution of the special situation in North China." In the original text, due to the speaker's position, only these two major issues of the present were mentioned without further elaboration. In fact, in our observation, the importance of these two issues surpasses the other parts noted and elaborated upon by Leith-Ross. They are related to the safety and danger of China, and currency and finance are only one aspect of their concerns.</p>
<p>At present, the issue of domestic security other than resisting invasion and suppressing bandits, although the news is constantly changing and people are frightened and disheartened, only two weeks have passed since the Second Plenary Session. A peaceful resolution may be hoped for, and the joint telegram from Song and Han expressing their sincere concern to the Central Government is also sufficient to ease the situation and alert those intending to start a war. Furthermore, the public opinion against civil war has become consistent, and those involved should read the words "national ruin is imminent" and repent. The consistent public opinion is also sufficient to exert a restraining effect. Those who violate the consistent public opinion will fail. The past is like this and can be a lesson.</p>
<p>The special situation in North China involves political and diplomatic issues and economic issues. Now, based on the meaning of Leith-Ross's speech, focusing on the issue of smuggling related to the economy, Leith-Ross lightly believed the exhortations of one party, so he hoped that various difficulties could be resolved. However, the reporter observes the rampant attacks of smuggled goods on the market and the obstruction encountered by anti-smuggling efforts, believing that it is not enough for the people to have the determination to stop smuggled goods on their own to promote the resolution of difficulties. Now the government has issued strict punishment regulations. The crime of tax evasion is punishable by death for serious offenses, and those over 1,000 yuan are subject to life imprisonment. There is no way to add to the severity of the prohibition. Only by hoping that the general public can assist in the implementation of the law and jointly reject smuggled goods to maintain legitimate commerce, will the smugglers' skills be exhausted, and the smuggling problem will not be difficult to resolve as Leith-Ross said.</p>
<p>Sir Frederick Leith-Ross came to investigate China's financial and economic difficulties and to determine the possibility of assisting China in overcoming these difficulties, so his statements are generally focused on currency and finance. However, the two prerequisites he mentioned in conjunction with these issues can only be effectively resolved with public opinion and public power. We hope that the people of the country will know that their own strength is reliable and make efforts accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Regulations for the Implementation of the National Assembly Representative Election Law (Draft) <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>

<h3 id="e28">Issue of Warships Passing Through the Straits - Montreux Conference - Soviet Russia Demands Special Treatment - Black Sea Fleet Should Not Be Restricted by Treaty - France Supports, Japan Opposes, Britain Makes No Statement <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Montreux, Switzerland The Montreux Conference continued its sessions this morning. The Soviet representative, Foreign Commissar Litvinov, immediately proposed a motion arguing that the maximum tonnage limit set in the new convention draft proposed by Turkey regarding the passage of warships from all countries through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits should only be applied to "countries not bordering the Black Sea." The provision prohibiting submarines from passing through the straits should also include aircraft carriers, and that warships from Black Sea countries exiting the Black Sea through the straits should not be restricted in the same way as warships from non-Black Sea countries entering the Black Sea through the straits. The Japanese representative, Ambassador to France Sato, immediately expressed disagreement. Japan is prepared to accept the restrictions on warships from all countries entering the Black Sea as stipulated in the new convention draft, but only on the condition that they are applied simultaneously to those exiting the Black Sea. The British representative, Lord Stanhope, Minister of Public Works, refused to participate in the discussion because he had not received instructions from his government. Litvinov then proposed an amendment, arguing that warships of belligerent countries should be prohibited from entering the Black Sea, but this should not apply to those whose purpose is to fulfill obligations under mutual assistance treaties. The meeting was then adjourned and scheduled to continue tomorrow to discuss all commercial clauses contained in the new convention draft by the technical committee this afternoon. (Havas Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Montreux, Switzerland Today, at the conference of countries signatory to the Treaty of Lausanne, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov requested that Soviet warships be given free passage from the Black Sea, so that the Soviet Union could fulfill its obligations under the League of Nations Covenant when necessary. The French representative, Poncet, supported Litvinov's proposal and suggested that the convention should stipulate that all countries may use the straits to fulfill their obligations under regional agreements established within the League of Nations, which would allow France to send warships to aid the Soviet Union in accordance with the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance agreement. (Reuters Dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Montreux, Switzerland This afternoon, the Montreux Conference continued its sessions and discussed the issue of the free passage of merchant ships from all countries through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits, and began to study all the clauses in the new convention draft that could be applied to international commercial interests. According to recent statistics, the total tonnage of ships passing through the two straits each year is 12 million tons, of which Italy accounts for the largest share with 2,527,000 tons, followed by Britain with 1,086,000 tons, followed by Greece, Norway, Romania, Germany, France, and other countries. It is reported that Japan argues that the connection between the new convention on the straits issue and the League of Nations Covenant should be minimized as much as possible. The French representative, former Minister without Portfolio Poncet, met with the Japanese representative, Ambassador to France Sato, today to discuss this matter. Also, at today's meeting, the secretariat received letters from the governments of India and the Union of South Africa, stating that they could not send representatives to attend the meeting, but had no objection to the amendment of the current straits system. The next plenary meeting is scheduled to be held tomorrow. (Havas Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e29">British House of Commons Discusses Foreign Policy - Labor Party Impeachment Motion Rejected - Failure of International Rule of Law Replacing Barbaric Forces - British Politics Still Based on the League of Nations <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(London) Attlee, leader of the opposition Labor Party, moved an impeachment motion against the government in the House of Commons today, stating that "the British government's decision to pursue a firm and consistent foreign policy has diminished the country's prestige, weakened the League of Nations' position, and endangered peace, and has therefore lost the confidence of this House." Attlee and Sinclair of the opposition Liberal Party both spoke out vehemently against the government's actions. Home Secretary Simon spoke on behalf of the government in response, and Prime Minister Baldwin concluded the debate with a speech. The impeachment motion was then put to a vote and rejected by a vote of 384 to 170.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the House of Commons today was not as tense as last Thursday when the government announced its intention to support the lifting of sanctions against Italy. Before the meeting, Foreign Secretary Eden had a three-quarter-hour meeting with the King. Italian Ambassador to London Grandi quietly listened to the debate in the audience.</p>
<p>When Attlee moved the impeachment motion, he declared that the government had pursued a weak and hesitant policy over the past five years, causing the country to fall from its high position in 1931 (shouts of ridicule from the cabinet benches). The government abandoned Abyssinia and destroyed the League of Nations, making it no longer an effective tool for seeking peace. Now that Italy is allowed to triumph over Abyssinia, no member of the League of Nations will have any security. The British Empire does not fully agree with the lifting of sanctions, and the most closely affected dominion (the Union of South Africa) strongly opposes this move. What will the natives of South Africa and the world think of this? If Mussolini is willing to expand his rule, will Prime Minister Baldwin fight for the Somaliland Sultanate or the Kenyan war? The government is unwilling to risk peace and has increased the risk of war. The government abandoned the opportunity to unite Europe into a true collective security.</p>
<p>The next speaker was Sinclair, a key member of the Liberal opposition, who said that the government had been consistently controlled by fear during the crisis of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Italy was in the grip of the League of Nations' economic power, and when this weapon was about to take effect, the government abandoned it. The government's policy has allowed the aggressor to profit from outside, and has made the world dependent on dictators. The government should have clearly told Mussolini at the Stresa Conference that if he insisted on his policy towards Abyssinia, the entire British people would rise up against him. Sinclair also did not believe that the League of Nations or sanctions had failed, saying that they had not been given a chance.</p>
<p>Then Simon rose to speak on behalf of the government, saying that he, like all members, deeply felt that the League of Nations had suffered a major setback. Financial and economic sanctions cannot protect a member state from foreign aggression. The effort to replace barbaric power with international order has failed. The government and those who support the government feel no less deeply about the damage this has done to international moralism than the opposition. Some say that sanctions should have been implemented earlier, and they may have been effective today. However, the League of Nations Covenant stipulates that this step cannot be taken until war has broken out. In other words, Eden promoted this action faster than anyone else. Eden had previously stated that Britain was very happy to see the implementation of oil sanctions, but some still blame the British government for the fact that this sanction did not materialize. This is truly an unfair argument. All who hoped that sanctions would have good results are now deeply disappointed to see that sanctions have failed and the Italo-Abyssinian war has ended. The continued implementation of sanctions cannot change this result. Those who implemented sanctions must now decide whether the current environment is right to collude with those who use force to change resolutions. He believes that none of the League of Nations member states are prepared to use this force, and the British government is not prepared to use it either. Some advocate that if Britain goes to war, the British navy in the Mediterranean may be subdued. This is not true. He dares to believe that the British navy would have a very good record in this situation, but the government, in the current European situation and the major dangers surrounding Britain, does not want to see even one ship sunk in a victorious naval battle for the sake of Abyssinia. The government will not change its policy or its loyalty to the League of Nations because of the action it is taking at present. The government is now facing reality and considering how to strengthen the League of Nations' position so that it can cope with this kind of shock and dispute in the future. Serving the League of Nations in this way will be far better than today. The Foreign Secretary has already started this work and has been in contact with other League of Nations member states. This move must also be discussed with the dominions before a decision can be made.</p>
<p>Finally, Prime Minister Baldwin concluded the debate, saying that the government had no intention of condoning Italy's actions. The government has no power to lend money to Italy and does not want to seek this power. Collective security has failed because almost all European countries do not want to carry out military sanctions. The League of Nations' responsibility today is to examine how it can act in the future based on its recent experiences. Britain's policy is still based on the League of Nations.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister then praised Eden for putting his heart into the struggle to maintain the League of Nations, saying that the government's opposition to continuing and strengthening sanctions against Italy is because nothing but military action can slightly change the position of Italy and Abyssinia. The League of Nations has suffered a severe setback, but the failure of the first attempt to implement collective security must not be seen as the death of the League of Nations. When the League of Nations General Assembly meets in September, it will inevitably carry out all matters. At present, the government must not only decide on its own resolutions, but also exchange informal opinions with the governments of the dominion and other member states of the League of Nations, especially France. The second purpose of the government's policy is to pacify the overall situation. Some say that if Britain can secure its own country in the West, the government intends to allow the whole of Europe to seek its own safety. This view is unfounded. However, if the League of Nations ultimately breaks down, then there may be such a day. However, he has all kinds of hopes that when the three major countries start negotiations in the future, they will be able to raise a way to secure the countries of Central Europe, because the British government also hopes to raise it for Britain.

<h3 id="e31">French Government's Foreign Policy: House Votes Confidence; Foreign Minister Delbos Delivers Declaration <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) After debating foreign policy today, the House of Representatives, composed of a majority from various countries, jointly proposed a vote of confidence in the government, which passed with a majority of 184 votes. The motion included (1) endorsing the government's declaration and (2) expressing confidence in the government's collective security measures to protect France's peace. Before the vote, Foreign Minister Delbos answered various questions, explaining the government's position, particularly regarding the German threat. Delbos stated that the government's rejection of isolationism or old alliances was a faithful adherence to collective security, and it was deeply aware of the dangers of German aggression. France remains calm and will not accept ambiguous interpretations of violations of the Locarno Pact. It now intends to negotiate a treaty with Mediterranean countries to ensure no hegemony is established in the Mediterranean. He also hopes to establish a compromise in Western Europe to end the crisis that began on March 7 (German troops entering the Rhineland). However, this cannot be achieved solely by France. Italy has informed France of its willingness to cooperate in this effort. France advocates for gradual and universal disarmament under the control of international organizations, while not neglecting the necessary national defenses. France intends to request the convening of an international committee in Geneva to control the production of war materials. To improve the overall economic situation, the French government also intends to request the convening of a committee to study the European unity issue initiated by the late Briand. This committee will include European countries, whether or not they are members of the League of Nations, so that Germany can also participate. Delbos finally mentioned the possibility of peace, stating that if international organizations do not reveal their strength for a long time, France's defense must be maintained at its current level. France has a responsibility to itself and its friends to be in a position to deter all aggression. (Reuter's dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Following Foreign Minister Delbos's declaration on foreign policy in the parliament, a debate immediately commenced. Several members from the right-wing and center parties successively expressed their opinions, explaining the critical situation in Europe. Among them, Conservative Member of Parliament Grillet stated that Germany now has the immediate capacity to attack Czechoslovakia, for which France has made absolutely no preparations and does not know how to respond. Regarding France itself, "1,800 German tanks, along with several mechanized divisions, could pass through Belgium and reach France within two days. This danger cannot be ignored." Subsequently, Delbos responded, stating that the German Nazi Party advocates racism, and its aspirations are even greater than those who purely advocate nationalism. He is deeply aware of this danger. "However, France remains calm and will do its utmost to safeguard international justice. Germany's abolition of the Locarno Pact should only be regarded as an illegal act, with a clear and unambiguous meaning. When the League of Nations convenes an extraordinary meeting at the end of this month, the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact will naturally take the opportunity to exchange views. If Germany has submitted an answer regarding the British question at that time, France will immediately study it to seek a proper foundation. In short, France does not threaten any country, nor will it allow other countries to threaten it. "France adheres to justice and will do its utmost to complete its arduous task." The discussion concluded at 10 PM. The Senate is scheduled to discuss the government's declaration on Thursday. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Léon Blum attended the Senate this afternoon and delivered a declaration on foreign policy. Foreign Minister Delbos delivered a similar declaration in the House of Representatives. The main points are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>The declaration's first paragraph addresses the collective security mechanism, stating that the League of Nations Covenant should not be subject to sweeping revisions. Only minor textual deletions are needed to clarify the interpretation of the Covenant's articles. In the French government's view, the collective security mechanism should have two key points: (1) All countries neighboring an aggressor must exert their full strength to resist the aggressor. (2) All other member states of the League of Nations must uniformly implement economic and financial sanctions against the aggressor. Regional pacts are neither tools to threaten any country nor do they constitute a pre-World War I alliance system. "The French government now intends to vigorously promote negotiations on regional pacts, such as the Danube Pact and a Mediterranean Pact involving Spain and the Balkan Entente countries." Regarding the German question, the declaration stated that the parties affiliated with the left-wing Popular Front have long sought to reconcile France and Germany and have spared no effort in pursuing this goal. However, Germany's abolition of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles and its subsequent destruction of the Locarno Pact are still fresh in our minds and cannot be easily forgotten. "Although France is still prepared to consider any German proposals in order to seek a compromise, this compromise should not be directed against any country." Regarding the issue of disarmament, it stated that France has decided to request the League of Nations to establish a permanent committee in Geneva to disseminate as much information as possible regarding the manufacture and control of munitions. The current government should first request the parliament to pass a bill to nationalize the munitions industry, which is the first step in state control. Regarding the Sky Pact, it stated that France is prepared to sign a pact to limit air force armaments, whether in Western Europe or throughout Europe. Finally, the declaration stated that freedom of thought and democratic progress in an environment of peace and freedom are the rights that mankind has inherited from generation to generation, and France is determined to protect them.

<p>(Paris) The Senate today passed a bill allowing the Bank of France to lend 10,000,000,000 francs to the government by a vote of 184 to 90. The bill also authorized the government to issue an additional 12,000,000,000 francs in treasury bonds. At the same time, the government's two bills regarding the franc have been announced. One stipulates that anyone who spreads rumors to shake public confidence in the franc and the value of public securities may be sentenced to three months to two years of imprisonment and fined up to 10,000 francs.

<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry held a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 23rd to determine a new diplomatic policy for overall administrative reform. Foreign Minister Arita, Vice Minister Horiuchi, and all bureau chiefs, directors, and section chiefs attended, and the discussion lasted for three and a half hours. The main points of the decision are as follows:</p>
<p>The international situation centered on Japan is tending to deteriorate, requiring the strengthening of national defense and the establishment of an independent and proactive diplomacy.</p>
<p>Based on the inseparable relationship between Japan and Manchuria, strengthen policies towards Russia and China, while striving to obtain resources and develop trade to establish the people's right to survival.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry will prepare a draft based on this outline and submit it to the cabinet meeting on the 10th of next month.

<p>(London) The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador, Shigeru Yoshida, arrived here this morning and told the press that Japanese public opinion believes that the friendship between Britain and Japan, whether in the Far East or elsewhere, would be beneficial and necessary if it could be restored and enhanced. This is of great significance, but based on past experience, the sentiments of Britain and Japan regarding the promotion of friendly relations have often failed to occur simultaneously, which is regrettable. In the future, his primary mission will be to stimulate such sentiments so that they appear simultaneously, thereby promoting friendship between the two countries. The first step is to explore and will begin immediately. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) The new Japanese ambassador, Yoshida, told a Reuters reporter today that Japan is very concerned about the future of Shanghai. Many countries are related to Shanghai, so this has become one of the major issues in the Far East. Yoshida smiled and denied the rumors that he came here with the mission of concluding a British-Japanese agreement, saying that he must first consider the overall situation and then promote mutual understanding based on the traditional friendship between Britain and Japan. When the reporter asked if there was a possibility for Britain and Japan to frankly discuss all unresolved disputes, Yoshida welcomed this view, but said that it contained many disputes, such as the interests of Britain and Japan in China and the future of China, Japan's trade in British colonies, and naval construction issues, which are not easy to resolve. As commercially focused countries like Britain and Japan are bound to have conflicts on many points, it is not easy to see both countries willing to discuss the same issue at the same time. However, he felt that Britain and Japan must eventually reach a compromise, and the peace and prosperity of the Far East depend on this compromise. Yoshida did not want to discuss the issue of smuggling in North China because Japan's point of view has not been properly heard. However, he believes that smugglers are definitely not just people in North China seeking personal gain. (Reuter's dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The government, due to the Australian government's increase in tariffs, decided to invoke the Trade Protection Act as a retaliatory measure. The relevant ministerial order has been approved, and preparations for the order and other matters have been completed. Therefore, it is scheduled to invoke the Act on the 25th, effective immediately. The intention has been telegraphed to Murai, the Consul-General in Sydney, to notify the Australian government. The Act adopts an import license system for wool, wool waste, or old wool, wheat, and wheat flour, but adopts an export license system for wool waste and wool rags. Tariffs on cheese, condensed milk, and butter will be increased by 50%. As for the aforementioned import or export license system, the implementation procedures will be announced by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in a ministerial order, and the Minister of Commerce and Industry will issue a notice to wool importers, instructing them to report the actual imports, the actual use, and the storage quantities of wool to wool industrialists and others for record-keeping.

<p>(Geneva) The international conference on drafting a "Convention for the Punishment of Illegal Trafficking in Narcotics" recently passed the draft convention by a vote of thirteen to one. "Contracting States, wherever they enjoy extraterritorial jurisdiction in the territory of another Contracting State, and their people illegally traffic in narcotics within that country, and the courts of that country cannot prosecute them in accordance with the various punitive measures contained in this Convention, hereby agree to enact necessary laws so that the consular courts stationed in that country may prosecute the drug traffickers in accordance with the law, at least the same as those who commit crimes in their own country."

According to the draft convention, it must be passed by a two-thirds majority to be established.

<p>(Geneva) The International Labor Conference rejected this morning a proposal to implement a 40-hour work week in the construction and steel industries. The French labor representative, Challier, delivered a speech expressing disappointment, stating, "The reduction of working hours is inevitable. This is not due to human volition, but the natural result of mechanical development. Whether you agree or not, if you do not accept it voluntarily, you will eventually be forced to accept it." He also said that France is now implementing labor and social laws (i.e., the 40-hour work week proposal). If other countries do not reduce working hours, France's economy will be threatened and will have to find ways to protect it. The Belgian labor representative, Meldon, spoke after Challier, with similar wording. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3 id="e40">US Democratic Party Convention Decides to Fight Republicans with the New Deal; Roosevelt is Strongly Supported by Representatives; Union Leader Assists in Drafting Platform <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Philadelphia, USA The Democratic National Convention opened here today at 1:02 PM. This is the first time since 1920 that the party has been on the defensive. The delegates attending the meeting are eager to answer the Republican attacks on the New Deal, so the issues of the party's platform and the conservative defectors have become secondary. The opening of the conference began with a prayer by Bishop Lamb, followed by a speech by Postmaster General Farley, chairman of the National Committee, unconditionally accepting the Republican challenge and making the New Deal the focus of the election campaign. Farley said, "The current problem of the people is beyond doubt: should we continue the New Deal that is saving the people from fire and water, or should we return the power to the old guys who destroyed the government before?" Farley attributed the responsibility for the economic downturn entirely to the Republican Party, saying that the financial giants were the backbone of the recent Republican governments. In 1933, they had fallen into an irrecoverable situation. After receiving the assistance of President Roosevelt, they were able to get rich again and deliberately slandered in order to destroy the people's faith in the president. As for the Republican Party's platform, it is a hodgepodge, trying to cover up the true face of the conservatives with the mask of liberalism. The reason why their candidate, Landon, was nominated was because he was able to meet the conditions of the big capitalists in the East and tried his best to express his liberal attitude in the West. When Farley mentioned President Roosevelt in his speech, the delegates cheered loudly. After the speech, the representatives paraded along the meeting place, each holding the flag of their state, which was similar to the scene when Hollywood made crowd films. Secretary of State Hull, New York Governor Lehman, and other nationally known figures also participated. The meeting adjourned at 2:38 PM. (National News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Philadelphia, USA The Democratic National Convention opened here at noon today. Postmaster General Farley, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, first gave a speech, which was broadcast nationwide by radio. Farley declared in his speech that to remove all smoke screens, the point of contention today is whether the new measures to save the country from disaster and depression should continue to be implemented, or should the government return to the hands of the general "old businessmen" who destroyed it before. The Republican Party's election platform is full of stale talk and empty declarations. The wealthy are now squandering millions of dollars in order to restore the ambiguous era that made some people rich. This generation eventually brought the country to the brink of bankruptcy. At the end of Farley's speech, he predicted that the real new measures would continue in a fair and orderly manner under the leadership of a quiet, capable, and brave leader, Roosevelt. After Farley's speech, the conference was extended to the evening. The evening meeting began with a speech by Senator Barkley, who made a "centrist" speech criticizing the US Supreme Court for destroying many of President Roosevelt's New Deal orders, saying that the majority of the "nine old men" had made "painful questions" about the Constitution in their resolutions. Barkley then criticized the financial outline of the administrative procedures set by Republican presidential candidate Landon, but Barkley made a statement to be refuted later regarding Hoover's criticism that the New Deal damaged American freedom. Barkley said that behind Hoover's call for freedom are the unforgettable pawnbrokers in the Republican Party, the real estate companies in the Republican Party, namely the American Liberty League, and the various figures who plot to squeeze the blood and flesh of the ox, namely securities traders and privileged people. He also said that President Roosevelt had rejected the suggestion that he should exercise dictatorial power. President Roosevelt is the epitome of justice. (Reuter's dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Philadelphia, USA It is heard that the first draft of the Democratic Party's platform cannot suppress the hopes of the party's leaders. The leaders regard the two items of foreign affairs and workers' working hours and wage regulations as too wavering and believe that a clear position should be taken. It is felt by the liberals that a stronger neutral law should be passed at the beginning of the dispute between Italy and Ethiopia, and Republican presidential candidate Landon has taken a clear position on each state's self-made working conditions regulations. Senator Lenores is now trying to add a clause to the party's platform to prohibit all immigrants from entering the country until the number of unemployed people is reduced. However, Lenores admits that it is very difficult to achieve the goal. Lewis, the president of the Miners Union, is regarded by the union as the first labor president of the United States in the future. He has been invited to assist in drafting the labor relations party's platform. Now 400,000 miners have agreed to support the Democratic Party, so the Democratic Party hopes to gain the support votes of the major states. (Reuter's dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>Berne, Switzerland The Emperor of Abyssinia is now considering residing in Switzerland. The Federal Council recently issued a notice to him, stating that the Swiss government is not convenient for a head of state who is at war with a neighboring country of Switzerland to reside for a long time. Therefore, before the dispute between Italy and Ethiopia is resolved, the Abyssinian Emperor should abandon the idea of residing in Switzerland. However, if the Abyssinian Emperor comes to attend the League of Nations conference in person to defend the claims made by the country, the Swiss government will naturally allow him to come here. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Berne, Switzerland Today, the authorities formally clarified that the Swiss government hinted that the Abyssinian Emperor should leave Switzerland on June 30, the closing date of the League of Nations General Assembly, saying that when the dispute between Italy and Ethiopia has not been resolved, the Swiss government cannot treat a head of state who believes that he is at war with a neighboring country of Switzerland with courtesy for a long time, without feeling inconvenienced, so there is this hint. According to reports, the Abyssinian Emperor will attend the League of Nations General Assembly in Geneva this time to appeal for justice for Abyssinia. (Reuter's dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) The Emperor of Abyssinia, who is living as an exile here, has always been represented by the government of the country. Yesterday, he invited Foreign Minister Eden to meet and explain the views of the government of the country. It is said that the Abyssinian Emperor declared to Eden that Abyssinia still exists and is still an independent country and is still continuing to resist the Italian aggression. From this point of view, when the League of Nations General Assembly opens at the end of the month, the Abyssinian Emperor may still come to attend in person to explain this "fact". British people have always believed that since the Abyssinian Emperor left, there has been no government in Abyssinia, and they believe that the British cabinet has determined the policy on the Abyssinian issue. No matter what aspirations the Abyssinian Emperor holds, this policy will not be arbitrarily changed. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>

Semi-official circles recently issued a communiqué stating that Aviation Minister General Göring and Undersecretary General Milch visited Italy together in the spring of 1923 to visit the Italian Air Force. General Valle came here to return the visit. In general, it is said that some powerful members of the German Nazi Party, in view of the evolution of the political situation in France, Belgium, and Spain, and the entry of power into the hands of the Socialist Party, now intend to try to promote friendship between Germany and Italy, so as to form a group of fascists to resist it.

<h3 id="e44">Sasaki Death Case: British Legation Opens Trial Yesterday <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>(Peiping) British Consul Fitzmaurice opened a coroner's court this morning at the British Embassy to investigate the death of Japanese officer Sasaki. British soldiers Kirk, Barrieu, and Hunter, who were involved in the disturbance in a drinking establishment on the night of May 26, the night Sasaki died, were summoned for questioning. Royal Counsel Mr. Buller-Fullerton-Smith served as the prosecutor, and Tianjin lawyer Kander represented the defendant. Mr. Buller-Fullerton-Smith stated that the summonses issued to the defendants were too vague because they would be asked to testify, and the summonses should clearly state that bodily harm was inflicted on a Japanese person (and that Sasaki was killed). Mr. Buller-Fullerton-Smith briefly outlined the reasons for the prosecution, saying that on the night of May 26, Kirk and Hunter had beaten several times in a disreputable establishment run by Koreans, but there was no evidence of Barrieu's guilt, so he was released immediately. Mr. Buller-Fullerton-Smith continued that the beating became acute after midnight, at which time Sasaki, a Japanese man who had arrived in Peiping for vacation on May 26, and a companion had just left the Kinzawa (transliteration) café on Hada Men Street when they saw two British soldiers arguing with a rickshaw puller. They stopped to watch, but unexpectedly, the British soldiers started beating Sasaki. Sasaki's companion fled to his hotel, but Sasaki did not follow. When the companion returned, he found Sasaki lying on the ground unconscious. He was sent to a hospital, where a doctor said he had died. Sasaki had been hit above his right eye, fracturing his skull and causing death from internal bleeding. A piece of torn cloth was found next to Sasaki's body, proving that he had been beaten by British soldiers. Next, Japanese man Oonishi, who arrived in Peiping from Shenyang on May 26, testified that on that night, he had gone to a Korean drinking establishment. Before midnight, he and a Japanese waitress were sitting in a room behind the drinking establishment when two foreign soldiers of unknown nationality broke in. One of them raised his fist and struck him heavily above the right eye, leaving a wound about one inch long. The soldier then hit him again, but he could no longer recognize the two soldiers. Many Japanese, Korean, and Chinese people came to court to testify in this case. Because the testimony had to be translated into English, the trial could not be concluded quickly, and it will take about two weeks to finish. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The British consular trial of the British soldier's killing of Sasaki was held at 11:30 this morning at the British Embassy under the presidency of Consul Fitzmaurice. British lawyers and Japanese witnesses were present. Based on a map submitted by the Japanese Embassy, the incident, the route taken by the British soldiers that night to the Korean drinking establishment until the killing of Sasaki, was made into a Japanese version of the certificate. A recess was taken at 12:30, and the trial resumed at 2:30. (Domei, 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e45">British and Japanese Newspapers Comment on Sir Leith-Ross's Remarks <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(London) Sir Leith-Ross's remarks to reporters in Shanghai yesterday have been prominently featured in major newspapers today. The Manchester Guardian stated that the knight has a better hope for the future of the Chinese government in maintaining monetary order and the financial budget than recent critics. The Morning Post stated that the knight's remarks are very interesting to read. The knight has firmly stated that there must be no action that reduces customs revenue. This goes without saying. The Financial Times asks everyone to pay attention to the fact that Chinese bonds have fallen due to various unfavorable news, such as the panic of the outbreak of conflict between China and Japan in early June and rampant smuggling in North China, and now Germany has skyrocketed. The knight's remarks will surely consolidate Chinese bonds, but today is the Chinese Dragon Boat Festival, so it is impossible to know its full effect, and buyers are also willing to study the knight's remarks calmly. British congressmen are now eager to verify their evaluation of the knight's recent talks with the Japanese authorities. People now generally believe that Japanese policy is still the focus of the overall situation in the Far East. All sectors of London are now speculating about whether the knight will petition the government to take practical action after he arrives in England. The Morning Post published an editorial today on the arrival of the new Japanese Ambassador to the UK, Yoshida, stating that this may be an auspicious sign of improved relations between Britain and Japan. Yoshida is well versed in the British national conditions, and has repeatedly advocated the friendship between the two countries. British people believe that the Japanese government's appointment of Yoshida as the ambassador to the United Kingdom is enough to show the Japanese government's intention to make further efforts to seek the basis of British-Japanese cooperation. The lack of cooperation between Britain and Japan is now deeply felt in China and the Far East, but there are still other issues, such as naval policy and trade between Japan and the British Empire, which also have room to seek better understanding. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Sino-Foreign Commercial News of the 24th published an editorial on Sir Leith-Ross's economic activities in China, the main points of which are as follows: Judging from the statement issued by Sir Leith-Ross when he departed from Shanghai, he has always been limited to economic issues, and has not mentioned anything about political issues. If we speak from Mr.'s so-called economic standpoint, this is certainly natural, but judging from the current situation in China, it is not possible to fully understand China by leaving political issues aside and only looking at economic issues. Since the British government hopes to expand and uphold its vested interests in China, then Sir Leith-Ross's views are certainly correct, but it seems not unreasonable to seek Japan's joint assistance. However, judging from past experiences or examples, no matter what kind of economic assistance is given to China, the result is that it is destroyed by politics, and there are many failures. This is very clear from the current situation of the railways laid with foreign capital. As for giving economic assistance to China, it is certainly not appropriate to avoid it completely, but in principle, no matter what is said, the first thing to do is to solve the political problems. The solution of China's political problems is certainly necessary, but if we discuss it in detail, there is no limit, but the conclusion really lies in China's peaceful unification, so that the relationship between China and Japan is close, and the mission of thoroughly ensuring the overall peace of East Asia. Then, what should be done is for China to abandon its so-called European and American dependence, which is the first shortcut. However, this is for other powers, because they want to uphold their national status, and in order to ensure their plans, they aim to contain other strong countries and secretly incite China. If there is no such thing, it is easy to achieve. We hope that the countries concerned will properly recognize the relationship between China and Japan, and that the British government will re-examine its view of China. This is what we hope for.

<h3 id="e65">Beijing Municipal Government's Budget for the 25th Year: Expense Budget Shortfall of Approximately One Million; Land Tax Levy Reduces Housing Tax <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing Communication: The beginning of the 25th year is approaching in an instant. In order to adapt the administrative plan and expense budget for the 25th year to each other, the Beijing Municipal Government is preparing the budget at the same time as drafting the administrative plan. After the plan was sorted out a few days ago, it was sent to the municipal government for review again. According to the person in charge of the municipal government, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>No Increase in Budgeted Standard Revenue</p>
<p>The municipal government's preparation of the budget for the 25th year, in addition to preparing the plan at the same time as adapting to the administrative plan, is also based on the expenses of the 24th year as the standard. According to the city's budget for the 24th year, the regular revenue was 5,657,425 yuan, and the temporary revenue was 3,680,000 yuan, totaling 9,337,425 yuan. Regular expenses were 4,739,919 yuan, and temporary expenses were 4,597,506 yuan, totaling 9,337,425 yuan. The deficit in the budget for the 24th year was originally over 2 million yuan. Because of the difficulty in raising funds, some non-urgent construction projects were postponed, and our expense deficit was reduced to over 1 million yuan. The expense budget for the 25th year is currently being calculated. Generally, it is planned to reduce it to the same amount as the 24th year. At most, the deficit will be between 1.5 million and 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>The municipal government's expenditures are mostly for education, followed by construction expenses such as road construction. In addition to increasing the number of schools and opening up roads, the administrative plan for the 25th year also plans to reorganize the shantytown areas. There are many shantytowns and poor people in the city. If they are not given relief, it will not only hinder the city's appearance, but also pose a problem for the development of their lives. In short, this city is located in the capital area, and there are many construction projects, but because of the difficulty in raising funds, it is difficult to achieve our ideal goals in a short period of time. As for the revenue budget for the 25th year, there is no increase. Although the land tax can be levied starting next year, 30% of the housing tax is stipulated to be deducted, so the land price tax only accounts for 70%. In the future, the total revenue will probably only be about 1 million yuan. Although this budget has been approved, it still needs to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>
<p>Housing Tax Collected at 70%</p>
<p>The Beijing Municipal Government originally planned to implement the collection of land tax and improvement tax at the same time starting in the 25th year. At present, the estimation of land prices can be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Land Law. It should not be difficult. The city originally had a Land Valuation Committee, which has a lot of experience in estimating land prices. However, although the estimation of improvements can be done when estimating land prices, it is extremely difficult to estimate old improvements. Even if you ask the owners, they are mostly confused. Moreover, the estimation of improvements actually requires on-site surveys of each household and separate estimations. After the estimation, the owners must be notified, and if there is any objection, a public hearing must be held. Therefore, the estimation of improvements throughout the city cannot be completed in less than two or three years.</p>
<p>Before the improvement tax can be implemented at the same time as the land tax, the municipal government plans to retain the housing tax and reduce it to 70% in order to show consideration for the burden on the citizens. This method has been approved by the Ministry of Interior and can be implemented after the Executive Yuan approves it again. The old housing tax can bring in 600,000 to 700,000 yuan per year. If calculated at 70%, it will be reduced to more than 400,000 yuan. The total amount of land tax is set at 600,000 yuan. The tax rate is currently being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. According to the current situation, the burden on citizens is actually lighter before the improvement tax is implemented. This is because the municipal government is taking into account both the city's treasury revenue and the burden on citizens. On the one hand, it does not want tax revenue to be short, and on the other hand, it must also take into account the burden on citizens so that there is no feeling of overlapping tax rates.</p>

<p>Beijing News: The Meteorological Research Institute of the Academia Sinica established a meteorological station on the Jade Emperor Peak of Mount Tai in Shandong Province in the 21st year of the Republic of China in order to observe high-altitude meteorological conditions. At that time, the Jade Emperor Hall was temporarily used as a place to store instruments and work. However, old-fashioned houses were very inconvenient for research. Therefore, the construction of a new station began on the top of the mountain in April of last year. Due to weather and altitude, it took one year and two months to complete. A few days ago, Lu Jiong, a full-time researcher at the institute, and Liu Futai, the design engineer of the station, went to inspect and receive it. The walls of the station are all made of granite, about two feet thick, and can withstand the strong winds on the top of the mountain. The total construction cost was more than 30,000 yuan. The station is 5,059 feet above sea level and is the only high-altitude meteorological observatory in East Asia.</p>
<h3 id="e67">A Glimpse of Relief Efforts in Guangdong Province: Dongguan County Builds a Home for the Disabled and Elderly <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province has spared no effort in promoting relief efforts in recent years, especially in caring for the elderly, weak, and disabled. All counties have been able to pay active attention. Recently, the Dongguan County Relief Home planned to expand its home for the disabled and elderly. It has been learned that since the home successively established facilities for the disabled, the elderly, medical treatment, and loans last year, its internal organization has become more complete. However, the home for the disabled and elderly is limited by space and cannot accommodate many people. As a result, the number of people registering and waiting for admission is increasing daily. Due to the inability to accommodate everyone, the director, Luo Youheng, believes that these poor people are indeed old and helpless, and their situation is particularly pitiful. He applied to the county government to find a way to build additional housing on the vacant land behind the branch home to expand its capacity. Surveying by workers has already been arranged at the home, and everything is being planned. Furthermore, a portion of the home's apprentices are prisoners sent by the county government after their release. Now, considering that many of these released prisoners possess skills and are aware of their past mistakes, the county government, in a gesture of compassion, has ordered the home to select twenty-seven inmates who have been in the home for over a year and have improved their character or are old and weak, and allow them to be released. County Magistrate Deng also visited the home to give a speech, instructing those released to thoroughly reform their past misdeeds and strive to be law-abiding citizens. At the same time, he ordered the home's loan office to lend each person five yuan to help them make a living after their release, with interest-free repayment within six months. He also required them to sign a pledge that they would not engage in any illegal activities after their release, and that if they committed another crime, they would be punished with the most severe penalties. The home also reported that due to the global economic downturn in recent years, there have been several requests each month from unemployed poor people seeking admission. Therefore, to achieve universal relief, it was submitted to the county government for approval to post a notice recruiting thirty apprentices to expand relief efforts.</p>
<h3 id="e68">The Huai River Conservancy Commission: Dredging of the Anfeng Pond Project; 60% of the River Dredging Project Completed <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The Anfeng Pond dredging project in Shouxian County, Anhui Province, is being managed by the Huai River Conservancy Commission with allocated funds. The Anfeng Pond Project Office of the Huai River Conservancy Commission was established in March of this year, and construction began in early April. The first step was to dredge the Biyuan River. The collection of workers was entrusted by the Huai River Conservancy Commission to the Shouxian County Government, which established a labor team management office to be responsible for handling the matter. When workers arrived, each person received an advance of 1.5 yuan for food expenses. Every ten days, the amount of work completed was calculated, with a fixed price of 9.5 cents per cubic foot, including drainage costs. The price was paid according to the amount of work completed. All advance food expenses and work prices were issued by the engineering office to the Shouxian labor team management office for collection and distribution. The Huai River Conservancy Commission and the Shouxian County Government have established detailed construction rules. At the beginning of the project, the work was relatively smooth. However, in early May, due to inadequate management of the labor team, workers scattered and deserted. The Huai River Conservancy Commission, eager to complete the entire project, approved the Shouxian County Government's request to increase the work price by 1.5 cents per cubic foot and advance another 3,000 yuan for food expenses, ordering the county government to continue recruiting workers. It has recently been learned that this is in progress. This dredging project is now 60% complete. It was originally scheduled to be completed by mid-month, but due to this setback, completion is expected by the end of the month or the beginning of next month.</p>

<p>Recently, the county's Business Tax Bureau has sent personnel to various businesses to conduct inspections for consolidation and plans to increase taxes by 2,000 yuan. Upon hearing this news, various industry associations were extremely apprehensive. Given the current economic downturn, they requested a tax reduction but were not granted it. Now, they are increasing taxes, which is beyond their means. They have successively appealed to Chairman Wei of the Chamber of Commerce to fight for a delay in the increase and to reduce the tax to the original amount. A meeting of the heads of various associations was convened on the 22nd to discuss the matter, but the bureau insisted on increasing the tax amount, and no result was achieved. The various associations are now convening a general meeting to decide on a course of action.</p>

<p>The Baoda Money Exchange on Guanqian Street was established in the summer of 1911 and has a history of twenty-five years. Its usual balance sheet is about two to three million yuan. However, due to the impact of the bankruptcy of Shanghai's Baoda Yutian Sui, it suddenly announced its closure on the previous day (the 23rd), the Dragon Boat Festival. Deposits are about four to five hundred thousand yuan, and only over ten thousand yuan is currently in the store. It has been decided to repay according to a pro-rata basis. The reason for the closure is that the exchange was opened by Shen Xingzhu. Shen also has two and a half shares in Baoda Yu. After Baoda Yu went bankrupt, these two and a half shares were responsible. Shen has been withdrawing, but various creditors are demanding compensation from the Shen family because other shareholders are hiding, causing the independently established Suzhou Baoda to also be brought down. However, the exchange initially wanted to maintain operations. It was not until 10 p.m. on the 23rd that it decided to close.</p>

<p>Chen Baozhen, the wife of Ye Zhaolin, who resides at No. 58 Shilin Temple Lane and has been doing business in the Northeast, is known as a hermaphrodite. A month ago, she was sued by a Miss Chen, who retained lawyer Ren Tianqiang, for adultery. As a result, society was in an uproar, considering it a strange event. Later, after Dr. Gu proved that Chen Baozhen was not hermaphroditic, a peaceful resolution was reached. Her husband, Ye Zhaolin, felt humiliated and was unwilling to live with Chen Baozhen. Therefore, both parties proceeded with divorce proceedings, which have matured. On the 24th, a divorce agreement was signed, and they parted ways. Whether Chen Baozhen is hermaphroditic remains questionable despite the doctor's identification and proof.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Stolen Coal Dispute Reaches Stalemate <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The case of the stolen coal in Liujiang has not yet been resolved. The unscrupulous merchants Ma Echu, Zhu Changshou, Lian Yuehun, etc., have all avoided meeting. Yesterday, Feng Bokang and Yang Zhaoqing, representatives of the Zhang Wanyuan warehouse owner, negotiated the cancellation of the lease with the original broker Xin Genji. (Note: After Ma Echu and others organized the Gongda Coal Company, they leased the Zhang Wanyuan Wine Shop as a warehouse, intending to store stolen coal.) At the same time, Feng and Yang questioned Wang Junshi, the representative of Mitsui &amp; Co., on four points: 1. The lessee is Ma Echu, not Mitsui &amp; Co. Mitsui &amp; Co. has no right to directly unload and store stolen coal. 2. The leasing procedures, such as the signing of the contract, the payment of the premium, and the rental balance, have not been completed, so the lease has not been confirmed. Even Ma Echu has no right to use it. 3. The lease date is set for July 5. Before July 5, even Ma Echu cannot arbitrarily unload and store coal, let alone Mitsui &amp; Co., which has no relationship. In particular, Zhu Haoran's prying open the lock and entering is even more illegal and should be dealt with according to law. 4. Dozens of tons of stolen coal have already been unloaded and stored in the warehouse. They should be removed immediately, and those not yet unloaded should not be unloaded. After being questioned, Wang Junshi and others were speechless. The boatmen, due to food problems, mortgaged the anchors on the boats. On the one hand, they also negotiated with the Mitsui representatives. It is heard that Mitsui has ordered the original boats to return to Jiangyin and transport the coal to Shanghai for storage. However, the boatmen are unwilling to load and transport the coal, so negotiations are still ongoing in Wuxi, resulting in a stalemate.</p>

<p>The home of Xie Binlai, owner of the Cao Juhe Cloth Shop, who moved to Yiju Village in the West Countryside, was suddenly attacked by more than a dozen robbers armed with handguns and wooden sticks around 11 p.m. the night before. After entering, they immediately tied up the Xie family members and then searched separately. They robbed cloth worth more than 300 yuan, cash worth 120 yuan, and clothing. Because they were not satisfied, they beat the victim with sticks, causing injuries all over his body. After the robbers left, the family hired someone to carry him to the city to the court for examination and reported to the district office to report to the county government to arrest the robbers.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Lecture on Biology 2: How to Study Biology in the Future <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Deyu</p>
<p>Among all the fields of learning, biology has the deepest relationship with human life, but the general youth in our country often regard it as unimportant. What kind of learning is biology? Why should we study biology? Last time, I talked about the contributions of biology to mankind. Today, I want to talk about "How to Study Biology in the Future."</p>
<p>Why should we study biology? We can talk about why we should study biology from both theoretical and practical aspects. From a theoretical point of view: human beings and other organisms follow the same evolutionary path, so why is the position occupied by human beings in nature significantly different from other organisms? From an organizational point of view, human beings are far inferior to lions and tigers. They have neither defensive organs nor strong physical strength. Why can they be the spirit of all things? I think this is a gift from human beings' management of social life. We must first recognize clearly that "it is not human beings who create society, but society that creates human beings." If you don't believe it, you can present evidence. Try taking a child from the Miao ethnic group, put him in our social education, and after he becomes an adult, he can do the same career as us and make the same contribution; if you send a child of a civilized person to be raised in the Miao ethnic group, even if he is intelligent, he will be useless and make no contribution in his life; therefore, whether a person makes a contribution to the world depends on whether there is a society behind him. Although human beings and bees also have societies, their societies have reached their extreme and cannot be improved further; while human societies are flourishing and progressing and developing forward.</p>
<p>The origin of human society is the family. The system of one husband and one wife not only originates from the impulse of sexual desire but also from the care and education of descendants. The reproductive period of human infants is longer than that of all other organisms. Therefore, couples have various relationships and have to have a permanent family organization. Since there is a family, there is a parent. The people of a family need to be controlled and ruled by the parent. In other words, the people of a family must obey the parent with a central force and have no absolute freedom.</p>
<p>In biological principles, weak animals can also resist strong enemies by uniting together. Ants and bedbugs are examples. For the sake of self-defense and to cooperate in resisting enemies, human beings form tribes from families and villages from tribes. With a strong central force and a spirit of obedience, there is progress in human society today. Because society is organized by individuals, the two spirits of "individualism" and "centralized power" are bound to compete with each other. The history of the struggle between these two spirits forms the history of mankind. We use the eyes of biology to investigate the experience of human progress, so that the origin of all ideological problems and social problems can be thoroughly understood and reasonably resolved. If we do not think from the source and want to engage in improving society, it is like climbing a tree to catch a fish, which is impossible. As for improving races, revitalizing nations, and improving domestic animals and crops, without basing on the theory of genetics, there will be no satisfactory results. Moreover, human health care and various industrial problems should be based on biology, so biologists should stand on the front line of society as general commanders, so that human civilization can become more prosperous.</p>
<p>From a practical point of view: hemp, cotton, wool, silk, and other clothing materials, dyes for dyeing clothes, grains, vegetables, fruits, meat, eggs, and other food materials, tea and coffee and other beverages, wood and other building materials or fuels, pathogens that cause diseases, and various medicinal materials for treating diseases. In short, the materials for clothing, food, and housing, and the raw materials for manufacturing industries, are all used by organisms and have a close relationship with human life.</p>
<p>How is biology divided into subjects? From theoretical and practical aspects, we have our own need to study biology. Biology began with past zoology and botany. The purpose of the two is the same, but the methods are different. The latter—zoology and botany—emphasizes records (recording objects), classification (identifying objects), and uses (using objects); the former—biology—emphasizes experience, reasoning, and attention to natural phenomena and principles of life. With the progress of the times, biology has been divided into many subjects. Based on the nature of each subject, it can be divided into the following three categories:</p>
<p>(A) Pure Biology Pure biology belongs to the science of theory, so it is also called Theoretical Biology. Depending on the type of object, it can be divided into three groups for convenience: "Zoology," "Botany," and "Anthropology." Each group can be further divided into "Morphology" and "Physiology." Morphology is also called the Science of Construction. It specializes in the morphology and structure of organisms and seeks their system from the comparison of mutual structures between races. It is further divided into "Organology," "Anatomy" (Histology, Cytology, Nuclear Science), "Embryology," and "Taxonomy." Physiology is the Science of Vital Phenomena. In a broad sense, it can also be considered the Science of Life. It is based on "Physiology," which discusses various principles of life, and includes "Ecology," which discusses the relationship between life activities and the external environment, and "Genetics," which discusses the generational relationship between systematic individuals.</p>
<p>(B) Human Biology Human biology is to discuss what impact various life phenomena carried out in animal and plant bodies have on the life activities of the human body? What kind of impact does the existence of a certain organism and its life activities have on human life? What is the relationship between the action of organisms on the inorganic world and human life? In summary, human biology is to discuss the ecological relationship between human life and biological life based on matters related to human life.</p>
<p>(C) Applied Biology How to use organisms that can be used as materials for clothing, food, housing, and raw materials for manufacturing industries? How to expand knowledge related to human life? This is the scope of research of applied biology. The types and various products we need in our daily life are all bestowed by applied biology. In terms of making a profit, there are subjects such as agronomy, forestry, manufacturing industry, agricultural manufacturing, horticulture, sericulture, animal husbandry, aquatic product manufacturing, and aquatic product fishing. The scope of application is expanding year by year, and the number of subjects is also increasing year by year. Therefore, the relationship between biology and human life is becoming closer, and its progress is not only directly related to the life of individuals but can also increase the country's wealth.</p>
<p>Our Research Goals Biology has pure biology and applied biology. Should we focus on pure biology, or applied biology? From a historical perspective, concrete sciences are all developed from practical knowledge, and practical use precedes and progresses more than theory. For example, botany originated from materia medica, useful plants, and horticulture; yeast in fermentation; hygiene in diseases; breeding experiments in edible plants and hybridization, etc. Therefore, some people advocate that learning without practical benefits has no value in research. This extreme view of focusing on applied biology and neglecting pure biology is also wrong. For example, the research of Leavenhoek and Pasteur, two pure biologists, mentioned last time. When they were doing research, they did not dream that this research would contribute greatly to the world. Their purpose was only to explore the truth and expand human intelligence. As a result, we were able to fight against pathogens in health and gain many benefits in food storage. These are all thanks to pure scientists. Therefore, we must not regard pure biology as useless learning, at least to understand that scholars who seek the truth can often produce great undertakings that affect the world and human beings. If we sit in a well and look at the sky, and only focus on practical benefits, we will hinder the progress of human intelligence.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Various Groups Held a Meeting Yesterday and Decided to Organize an Anti-Smuggling Association <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Published Declaration Announces All Sectors Uniting to Assist the Government in Reporting Smuggled Goods, Punishing Traitors, and Electing Wang Xiaolai and 35 Others as Committee Members</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation convened a joint meeting of representatives from its affiliated trade associations and various groups at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday at 2 PM to discuss ways to address the smuggling problem. Attendees included Cao Zhigong, Zhang Yichen, Hu Fengxiang, Chen Jiufeng, Wang Jingdong from the City Federation; Jiang Wanping from the Shanghai Institute of Certified Public Accountants; Gu Chengan from the Bankers' Association; Zhou Linxiang from the Watch Industry Association; Chen Chunrong from the Sand Boat Industry Association; Sun Choucheng from the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association; Yu Yaoqiu from the Southern Goods Industry Association; Wang Hanqiang from the National Products Preservation Association; Liu Zhongying from the China National Products Manufacturers United Association; Lu Xingzhuang from the National Products Factories United Association; Jin Chuxiang from the Salted Fish Industry Association; and over a hundred others.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After formalities were observed, Chairman Cao Zhigong delivered a report, stating in brief: "Recently, smuggling has become rampant in North China. Smuggling significantly impacts national treasury revenue and severely harms the entire national economy. They use a dumping policy to bring smuggled goods into the country, and people often buy them because of their low prices, obstructing the sales of domestic products. Therefore, all sectors of the city should, on the one hand, awaken the people to resist purchasing smuggled goods and, on the other hand, assist the government in investigating and cracking down on smuggling. This is why we are convening various groups today to discuss how to proceed to find an effective solution."</p>
<p>Resolutions</p>
<p>After the Chairman's report, discussions began. Regarding the case of "How to effectively prevent serious smuggling nationwide," it was resolved to establish the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Smuggling Association. Regarding the case of "Nominating committee members for the Anti-Smuggling Association," it was resolved to nominate Wang Xiaolai and others as committee members (details to follow). Regarding the case of "How to nominate candidates for the establishment of an investigation committee," it was resolved that the investigation committee members would be respectively responsible by various trade associations, labor unions, and district branches of the City Federation, with the list to be announced after confirmation. Regarding the case of "Nominating the drafting of the organization outline and work outline," it was resolved to nominate Cao Zhigong, Gu Yucang, and Zhu Yutao to draft. Regarding the case of "Publishing a declaration of establishment," it was resolved to pass it. Regarding the case of "How to express concern about Japan's increasing troops in North China, which damages our national sovereignty," it was resolved to telegraph the central government to conduct serious negotiations and immediately announce the abolition of the outdated Boxer Protocol. Regarding the case of "Telegraphing the authorities of Guangdong and Guangxi, calling for peace and unity against external aggression," it was resolved to telegraph the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities to withdraw the advancing troops.</p>
<p>Election of Committee Members</p>
<p>The following were nominated as committee members: Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Zhou Xuexiang, Yu Yaoqiu, Yu Zhenhui, Lin Kanghou, Yu Qiaqing, Huang Zaoxiong, Huang Renzhi, Zhang Yichen, Cao Zhigong, Chen Jiufeng, Wang Manyun, Gu Yucang, Liu Zhongying, Zhu Yangwu, Lin Meiyan, Feng Xiancheng, Jin Chuxiang, Zhang Tianbai, Zhang Xiaotong, Lu Muqin, Wang Jiean, Gu Wensheng, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Xiaochu, Huang Xianggu, Hong Songjiong, Ge Weian, Zheng Zenan, Gong Jingdang, Lu Xiaozuo, Wang Jingdong, Qu Zhenhua, and Chen Zhongying.</p>
<p>Publication of Declaration</p>
<p>The declaration states: "The means by which imperialists invade other countries is through military threats with the goal of economic exploitation. For the past century, our country has been under the political and economic oppression of imperialism. Our territory has shrunk day by day, our sovereignty has been eroded, and our national economy is on the verge of exhaustion. In recent times, the development of capitalism has become increasingly contradictory. Therefore, their exploitation of small countries or colonies is becoming increasingly brutal. The September 18th Incident proves the urgency of this situation. Now, the provinces in North China are under the control of a certain force and are in imminent danger. The vagrant Japanese and traitors, protected by special powers, are engaged in rampant tax evasion and smuggling. Customs duties are thus undermined, credit is affected, and national industrial and commercial enterprises are assaulted, plunging them into a situation from which they cannot recover. This city is a major port in East Asia and the economic center of the country. Water and land transportation are extremely convenient. It is also a gathering place for merchants of all kinds, both good and bad. If the vagrant Japanese and traitors use this as their base for tax evasion and smuggling, the consequences will be unimaginable. All sectors of this city are pained by the brutality of imperialist economic aggression and the impending doom of national subjugation. Therefore, the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Smuggling Association has been established, hoping to assist the government in reporting smuggled goods and punishing traitors from the standpoint of popular autonomy in order to maintain the economic lifeline of the country. We hope that all compatriots across the country will unite to eliminate smuggled goods. The future of the nation relies on this. This declaration is hereby made."</p>
<h3 id="e87">Chamber of Commerce Requests Ministry of Industry to Implement Industrial Control <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce again submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry yesterday, urging the implementation of industrial control, stating: "Regarding the matter of the Chamber submitting a request, the Chamber investigated that in April of last year, in order to save the decline of industry, it was appropriate to start with controlling production to avoid excess. It drafted sixteen articles of the Regulations for Industrial Control and submitted them to your ministry for adoption and implementation. Because it had not been approved for a long time, it submitted a document urging it. On September 6 of that year, the Ministry issued Directive No. 13241 of the Department of Industry, stating that this matter had been communicated to the provincial and municipal governments for discussion and reply, and that it would be obeyed after the collection and review of the specific plan, etc. At the same time, it also checked the Ministry's reply to the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan, stating that the provinces and cities that had responded to the Ministry included Guangxi, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Ningxia, Chahar, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guizhou, as well as Nanjing, Shanghai, and Peiping. In January of the 25th year, the Chamber again submitted a request for investigation and on the 21st of that month, it received Directive No. 14432 of the Department of Industry, stating that this matter was of great importance to the entire industrial future of the country, and that it should still wait for the provincial and municipal governments to review the previous case and reply to the Ministry before proceeding with the review. This matter has been submitted by the Chamber for more than a year. Whether there have been any further opinions received in addition to the nine provinces and three cities mentioned above, although it is impossible to speculate, the adjustment of national industries is related to the current tightening of foreign goods invasion, and the national industry is in danger of immediate collapse. Survival is at stake. It seems that it should not be delayed due to the delay of the provincial documents. In recent years, such as the silkworm silk control in Zhejiang Province, the silkworm seed control in Jiangsu Province, the black tea transport and sales control in Anhui and Jiangxi, and the industrial and commercial control in Shanxi and Guangdong provinces, the scope is even wider. According to reports, Guangxi Province also intends to control the main products to be exported from the province first. If the central government does not have a unified plan and regulations to improve its aftermath, it will inevitably make a country become countless economic groups, which will only increase chaos and hinder the sales of domestic merchants. In view of the domestic and international situation, the promulgation of the Industrial Control Regulations is really difficult to delay any longer. Therefore, the Seventh Members' Congress resolved to submit another request to your ministry to formulate the regulations as soon as possible so that they can be implemented as soon as possible. It is in the file for your information. It is respectfully requested that the Ministry review and approve the implementation, which will be convenient for the public."</p>

<h3 id="e90">Commodity Inspection Bureau Investigates Pests in Stored Grain, Resulting in Considerable Annual Losses <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>"The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, with Shanghai as the industrial and commercial center, the warehousing industry, the rice mill industry, and the flour mill industry, developed as the national champion. The general occurrence of grain pests causes considerable annual losses. Experts were specially assigned to investigate, and the results are now available. The reporter from the East China News Agency briefly records the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Pest Situation in Warehouses</p>
<p>Warehouses that are ravaged by grain pests are mostly not ventilated, not exposed to sunlight, are in humid locations, and have many gaps, giving pests the opportunity to breed. Climate factors such as temperature and humidity can directly affect the breeding of pests. If the temperature and humidity of a certain period are suitable for the reproduction and development of a certain pest in the warehouse, the pest will be rampant. The grain pests found in warehouses often appear in garbage, debris, and crevices. Grain pests are mostly omnivorous and can chew on a variety of grains for food. If grain is constantly available, pests can survive for a long time. Shanghai is a gathering place for boats and vehicles, and goods are moved in and out all year round, so pests have many opportunities to spread.</p>
<p>Complex Types of Stored Grain Pests</p>
<p>The stored grain pests that occur in warehouses are very complex, and the quantity is (A) Moths: One-spot grain moth, Large-spot moth, Indian grain moth, Wheat moth; (B) Beetles: Grain weevil, Mung bean weevil, Red flour beetle, Large flour beetle, Black cocoon beetle, are all very harmful."</p>
<p>Rice Mill Pests Estimate Five Types</p>
<p>The most harmful is the one-spot grain moth, which spreads along both banks of the Suzhou River. The large flour beetle spreads in Xinzha Road and the aforementioned areas. The black sesame beetle and the red flour beetle spread in the rice mills on Gongguan Road and Tiantong Road. The large beetle thief is also found in excellent white rice, but it has the habit of preying on other pests and cannibalizing itself, so it can also be called a beneficial insect.</p>
<p>Few Found in Flour Mills</p>
<p>All kinds of flour mills in Shanghai are well managed. The stacking of flour bags is very orderly. The location and construction of the warehouses are often in line with high, ventilated, light, and clean conditions, so there are fewer pests. However, in the wheat warehouse, with gray walls and broken grains all over the floor, grain weevils are very rampant, eroding the wheat, making the wheat grains empty and turning them into grain crumbs. In addition, there are also wheat moths, large flour beetles, grain thieves, etc., which are also quite a few types.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Various Industries Steadily Passed the Mid-Year Financial Settlement Period; Banking and Finance Industries Operated as Usual Yesterday; Qian Zhuang Shops Repaid Loans; Banks Handled Final Accounts; The Business Plans of Both Industries Still Based on Previous Principles <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>"New Sound News Agency reports that after the Shanghai industrial and commercial sectors steadily passed the mid-year financial settlement period, member banks and Qian Zhuang shops of the banking and finance industry associations resumed normal operations yesterday. The affiliated bank joint preparation meeting, bill exchange, bank draft acceptance, Qian Zhuang preparation bank, Qian Zhuang market, etc., also resumed normal operations at the same time. The foreign exchange in the Qian Zhuang market was nine points in both the morning and afternoon markets. As for industry and commerce, since the government's new currency policy was implemented, it has gradually become active, so this year's mid-year settlement is different from previous years.</p>
<p>Business Plans of the Banking and Finance Industries</p>
<p>The reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the banking and finance industries yesterday that banks and Qian Zhuang shops, in view of the sluggish market, have been particularly cautious about various loans since last year and have unanimously tightened them to save expenses. As for the employment and reduction of employees, the end of the year is usually the time for departures and retentions. The rumors that the banking and finance industries would lay off employees in large numbers during the mid-year financial settlement period are not true. In the future, the banking and finance industries will still operate according to the previous principles. Moreover, although the first half-year final settlement period of the banking industry this year is approaching, due to the careful operation, various commercial banks can still make a profit."</p>
<p>Bank Financial Reports, Qian Zhuang Loan Repayments</p>
<p>The banking industry will be closed on July 1 and 2 to handle the first half-year final settlement of the 25th year. The interest settlement of the savings department was implemented on the 20th, and the interest settlement of the commercial department will begin today. The Bankers Association is scheduled to hold a members' meeting at 4 PM on the 7th to report on the association's affairs. The 18 million yuan that the Qian Zhuang shops borrowed from the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications is still 14 million yuan unreturned. Because it has been overdue for a long time, the borrowing shops will try to repay it successively after the mid-year financial settlement.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Jiangsu and Zhejiang Cocoon Shops Have Stopped Weighing; The Syndicate Has Stopped Lending <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>A total of 11.5 million yuan has been lent; the matter of the borrowers returning the money is already being handled</p>
<p>The New Sound News Agency learned from the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Spring Cocoon Purchase and Loan Syndicate in the 25th year that after handling the silk manufacturers and surplus cocoon merchants to purchase cocoons and lend money, the syndicate has lent a total of 30 million yuan. The initial deadline was May 20 in Zhejiang and May 25 in Jiangsu, and then a special extension was granted. They could also apply for additional loans at any time as needed for cocoon purchase. Now the local cocoon shops in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have stopped weighing one after another. The Shanghai General Office and the Hangzhou and Wuxi branch offices have all suspended cocoon purchase and lending and are only handling the silk manufacturers and surplus cocoon merchants who have borrowed money to return the money. This time, a total of 11.5 million yuan has been lent, with Jiangsu accounting for 70-80% and Zhejiang accounting for 10-20%, which is distributed according to the proportion of the number of loans borne by the banks and Qian Zhuang shops participating in the syndicate. A meeting of the committee's banks and Qian Zhuang shops will be held regularly to report on the details of the loans and handle the end. It is heard that the syndicate's cocoon purchase and lending has benefited farmers and merchants a lot. Therefore, when the autumn cocoons are on the market this year, it is planned to reorganize the "Jiangsu and Zhejiang Autumn Cocoon Purchase and Loan Syndicate in the 25th Year" to handle the autumn cocoon lending. The specific measures are still under discussion."</p>
<h3 id="e95">Shipping Association Held Its Annual Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Discussed plans for shipping cooperation and financial adjustment; Elected Li Zhiyi and Yu Qiaqing as Executive and Supervisory Committee Members</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association held its annual meeting at 3 PM yesterday at its office on Guangdong Road. The meeting re-elected executive committee members, added supervisory committee members, and discussed plans to promote shipping cooperation, shipping financial adjustment, and shipping shipbuilding insurance industry joint-venture dockyard plans. Fifty member representatives from Sanbei, Shao, Zhengji, etc., and 92 people including Yuan Ludeng and Wang Bofen attended. Each person received a copy of the Shipping Yearbook. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Resolutions</p>
<p>The presidium consisted of Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, and Wang Bofen. The recording secretary was Secretary-General Yang Youlong, and the master of ceremonies was Director-General Cen Qi. First, the presidium reported on the association's affairs and accounts. Representatives from the Municipal Party Department Mao Yun, the Social Affairs Bureau Zhang Dafu, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yuan Hongjun delivered speeches one after another. Then the discussion began. The three cases of promoting the national shipping cooperation plan, the shipping financial adjustment plan, and the shipping shipbuilding insurance industry joint-venture dockyard plan were resolved to be handled by the Executive Committee. The amendment to the articles of association to add seven supervisory committee members was passed.</p>
<p>Election of Executives and Supervisors</p>
<p>Five executive committee members were retained: Mo Zhiyao, Du Yuesheng, Shen Zhongyi, Chen Shuntong, and Wang Zigang. Six new members were elected: Li Zhiyi, Feng Youxin, Lin Xisheng, Fang Jiaobo, Luo Lianchen, and Huang Jiaqiu. Five alternate members were Chen Yisheng, Zhang Shulin, Wang Gengsan, Zhang Dechun, and Yao Shumin. Seven supervisory committee members were elected: Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Wang Bofen, Li Zichu, Lu Bohong, Chen Ganqing, and Xu Zhongxin. Three alternate members were Lianchen, Jiang Runsheng, and Shen Jinzhou. The meeting adjourned after a group photo.</p>
<p>Swearing-in Ceremony</p>
<p>The reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the association yesterday that the newly appointed executive committee members Li Zhiyi, etc., and supervisory committee members Yu Qiaqing, etc., are scheduled to hold a swearing-in ceremony next week. In addition, the association, in view of the fact that China's shipping industry is still in its infancy, with frequent disasters and business decline, and that the shipping industry has been affected by it and is becoming more and more degraded, those engaged in this industry are struggling hard, and their predicament is indescribable. Looking forward to the future, there is no optimistic hope. However, the shipping industry shoulders the mission of sea and river transportation, not only occupying an important position in commerce but also being closely related to national strength and international competition. We must encourage ourselves to move forward and not slack off. Therefore, the "Shipping Yearbook" is compiled to draw on past events for observation and to serve as a warning and encourage ourselves to move forward. The content is very rich, and the price is five yuan for hardcover and four yuan for paperback. It is published by the association.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Submits to the Ministry of Finance: Requesting Relief for Domestic Tobacco Leaf <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Ningbo Native Association Sends Letters to the Ministries of Finance and Industry</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance, stating: "This is a petition to request relief based on the circumstances. During the seventh session of the Member Representative Assembly held by the association on June 20th, a letter was received from the local tobacco leaf industry association, stating that a certain local newspaper had reported that the government intended to implement unified control of tobacco leaves, and it was rumored that this so-called unified control was actually a euphemism for monopoly. Although detailed measures have not yet been promulgated, the matter is inevitable. If this matter is implemented, the entire tobacco leaf industry will inevitably become unemployed, and those who sell tobacco leaves, directly and indirectly, number no less than hundreds of thousands. Once there is no business to operate, how will they make a living? The association is deeply concerned about the difficulties of the times and offers the following suggestions and six measures, regarding improving tobacco leaves, promoting domestic products, preventing raw materials for private cigarettes to enrich national taxes, and improving the industry. These are merely humble opinions, and the implementation measures still need to be discussed and determined in the future. However, once the outline is in place, the details will be easy to discuss. If the government's unified control of tobacco leaves is solely for the purpose of preventing tobacco leaves from supplying raw materials for private cigarettes and there is no intention to fundamentally eliminate the tobacco leaf industry, then the above-mentioned measures of the association will not only be for the survival of the industry but also for the government's benefit." The association also attached its opinions and measures regarding the production of domestic tobacco leaves, which were submitted to the assembly for resolution and referred to the executive committee for deliberation. It has been found that in recent years, due to the encroachment of foreign goods and the desire for high quality, most domestic cigarette manufacturers have adopted foreign tobacco. The American tobacco grown in Henan, Shandong, and other places is mostly purchased by foreign tobacco factories. Privately produced cigarettes are rampant in the interior, which not only deals a major blow to domestic cigarettes but also has a significant impact on tax revenue. The opinions and measures provided are indeed for the sake of rescuing the entire domestic tobacco and tobacco tax industry. Therefore, the association has compiled the opinions and measures attached by the industry and presented them for consideration and adoption by the ministry for the public convenience."</p>
<p>Letter from the Ningbo Native Association</p>
<p>The Shen Shi News Agency reports that the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai, based on a letter from the tobacco leaf industry association stating that the government intends to monopolize tobacco leaves, sent separate letters to the Ministries of Finance and Industry yesterday, requesting that the matter be dropped to alleviate the difficulties of businesses. The original letter stated: "We respectfully submit the following. According to a letter from the Shanghai Tobacco Leaf Industry Association, we have learned that the production of tobacco in our country has a long history. Provinces such as Hunan, Henan, Fujian, Guangdong, Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui all have large-scale production. Although the varieties differ, they are all used for the manual production of water and dry tobacco, which is what is now called local tobacco. Since the influence of European trends in the East, foreigners have established cigarette factories in our country and worked hard to dump their products. Within a few years, they became popular throughout the country. At that time, the raw materials for the cigarettes produced by foreign factories were all transported from foreign countries (i.e., American tobacco). As a result, tobacco-producing areas throughout our country were greatly affected, and tobacco farmers suffered unspeakable hardships. Later, far-sighted people in our country, feeling that money was flowing out, also started to establish cigarette manufacturing factories, intending to use domestic tobacco leaves as the standard. However, domestic tobacco leaves are all sun-dried, resulting in a special odor when rolled into paper cigarettes, which is not suitable for cigarette use. Therefore, most Chinese factories also switched to using imported American tobacco, resulting in a year-by-year increase in foreign tobacco imports. Subsequently, foreign factories, relying on their strong capital, colluded with unscrupulous merchants to introduce American tobacco seeds into inland Shandong (Qingzhou) and Henan (Xuzhou) to grow cured tobacco. The annual output is about 9,000 tons each. The harvested tobacco leaves all belong to foreign factories, which purchase them at the lowest prices. In particular, Chinese people are not allowed to intervene in Xuzhou, Henan. Although our Chinese factories can obtain some tobacco supply, foreign factories have this cheap and high-quality raw material, and their dumping is even more intense and their profits are greater. Chinese factories cannot compete with them, and our tobacco leaf industry deeply feels that domestic tobacco leaves are declining. In order to prevent money from flowing out and to alleviate the suffering of tobacco farmers, they jointly organized a Domestic Tobacco Leaf Improvement Committee, reviewed domestic geology, raised funds to purchase American tobacco seeds from overseas, and sent personnel to Xuzhou in Henan and the seven nearby counties, as well as Qingzhou in Shandong, to distribute the seeds to farmers to plant American tobacco. They were cured by artificial coal-fired heating. As a result, the color and taste of Xuzhou (produced in seven counties) were the best, and they were suitable for cigarette use. Qingzhou was second. The tobacco leaves were evaluated and purchased by the industry to supply the needs of Chinese factories. Since then, the products of Chinese factories have been excellent and sales have increased sharply. Factories have adopted the methods one after another. Not only has the business of foreign factories gradually been hit, but the amount of imported tobacco leaves has also decreased year by year. Recently, domestic cured tobacco has sold well. The annual output of Xuzhou cured tobacco alone reaches 30,000 tons, and Qingzhou has also been increasing year by year. National tax revenues have increased and people's livelihoods have improved. Soon, the loopholes will be closed. Tobacco farmers can sell their tobacco leaves and do not have to sell to foreign factories at suppressed prices. The industry is privately pleased. However, they do not rest on their laurels and stop there. They still strive to catch up, striving to further improve tobacco leaves, improve business, and prevent the supply of raw materials for private cigarettes, in order to promote domestic products and stop the smuggling. However, a certain local newspaper recently reported that the government intends to implement unified control of tobacco leaves, and it was rumored that this so-called unified control was actually a euphemism for monopoly. Although detailed measures have not yet been promulgated, the matter is inevitable. If this matter is implemented, the entire tobacco leaf industry will inevitably become unemployed, and those who sell tobacco leaves, directly and indirectly, number no less than hundreds of thousands. If they lose their jobs, how will they make a living? The association is deeply concerned about the difficulties of the times and offers the following suggestions and five measures, regarding improving tobacco leaves, promoting domestic products, preventing raw materials for private cigarettes to enrich national taxes, and improving the industry. These are merely humble opinions, and the implementation measures still need to be discussed and determined in the future. If the government's unified control of tobacco leaves is solely for the purpose of preventing tobacco leaves from supplying raw materials for private cigarettes and there is no intention to fundamentally eliminate the tobacco leaf industry, then the above-mentioned measures of the association will not only be for the survival of the industry but also for the government's benefit. We hope that the government, which cares for businesses and people, will approve it. Your association has the same native ties and shares the same fate. We sincerely request that you forward the measures proposed by our association to the Ministries of Finance and Industry for adoption." The association has found that the industry's proposed measures are quite thorough in their intentions. In view of the aforementioned situation, the association has copied and attached the five measures and sent a letter to request verification and approval. We would be deeply grateful if you would grant adoption. Respectfully requesting a reply. Respectfully submitted to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance and Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry.</p>
<p>Proposed Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Leaf Industry Association has proposed five measures, which are to be forwarded by the Ningbo Native Association to the Ministries of Finance and Industry for adoption and implementation. The measures are listed below: A tobacco leaf general market should be established in Xuchang, Henan, and several tobacco leaf branch markets should be established in various counties, towns, and villages to facilitate the purchase of tobacco leaves by the industry. A cured tobacco factory should be established in Xuchang, Henan. Because the tobacco leaves in Xuchang are cured by tobacco farmers using traditional methods, the crude manufacturing is not perfect, and there are often poisonous, rotten, and discolored leaves. It is necessary to establish a cured tobacco factory on the spot for the industry to re-cure. Once the goods are completed, the tax authority will send personnel to the factory to add a tax-paid stamp before they can be transported to Shanghai for storage. A responsible transportation office should be established in Xuchang, Henan, and Hankou to transport the tobacco leaves purchased by various industries in Shanghai. Only tobacco leaves that have undergone the curing process can be shipped. A tobacco leaf public warehouse should be established in Shanghai, or two warehouses, specifically for storing cured tobacco for the industry. The Ministry of Finance and the Tax Authority should be requested to send personnel to the factory to monitor and prevent the supply of raw materials for private cigarettes. A joint business office for the tobacco industry should be established in Shanghai to handle all business operations of the industry. The most perfect method of organization should be discussed by the industry in conjunction with the tax authority. After its establishment, the joint business office will be the general organ. The markets for purchasing tobacco leaves in the producing areas, as well as the Xuchang cured tobacco factory and the transportation offices in Xuchang and Hankou, will all be affiliated with the joint business office. With a dedicated authority, and with frequent correspondence via letters and telegrams, the situation can be reviewed at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Ding Xie-lin Discusses Changes in the Ionosphere During Solar Eclipse Observation <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The Results Are Very Satisfactory</p>
<p>Mr. Ding Xielin, Director of the Institute of Physics of the National Central Research Institute, gave a speech yesterday, saying that the structure of the ionosphere is an important issue in geophysics. The impact of solar eclipses on the ionosphere is of great research value. Therefore, during each solar eclipse, scholars from various countries, in addition to observing changes in astronomy and meteorology, also study changes in the ionosphere. On the 19th of this month, there happened to be a solar eclipse. The institute began preparations several months ago. During the solar eclipse, the critical frequency method of radio waves was used to observe the impact of the solar eclipse on the ionization intensity of the ionosphere, and the reflection method was used to determine the change in its apparent height. In order to reduce the interference of external objects on the instrument during observation, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation was requested to order the broadcasting stations in the city to stop broadcasting from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. on the 18th and 19th of this month. Fortunately, all broadcasting stations were enthusiastic about scientific research and stopped broadcasting as requested. The official observations of the institute were conducted from the 17th to the 21st of this month. The results were extremely satisfactory. It was verified that the F layer and E layer of the ionosphere had significant changes during the solar eclipse. At the beginning of the eclipse, the critical frequency of the two layers was lower than usual. At the maximum eclipse, the critical frequency was even lower. Then, it gradually returned. After the eclipse ended, the critical frequency also returned to normal. Another impact was that the height of the FZ layer was also greater during the solar eclipse than usual. It is worth noting that this solar eclipse was a partial eclipse in Shanghai, but it already had a significant impact. The impact during a total eclipse should be even greater. Therefore, the total solar eclipse in the Yangtze River area in 1941 is a good opportunity to conduct this observation. The institute is planning to conduct more complete research at that time. The person in charge of this research is Mr. Chen Maokang, a researcher at the institute. The assistants in this study were assistant researcher Zhu Enlong and graduate student Liang Baixian. The detailed results are being sorted and drafted and will be published in a professional journal. The success of this study is due to the support of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau and the sacrifice of the broadcasting stations in the city in stopping broadcasting. The institute is very grateful.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Expansion of the China Tea Industry Association's Organization <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Political and Business Leaders Provide Support, All Tea Industry Groups Participate</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, domestic tea industry academics and tea merchant leaders, at the call of the National Economic Commission, met in the capital to discuss the technical improvement of the tea industry. In view of the urgent need to improve tea industry affairs, but the fact that there is no unified public organization in the country to lead the tea industry is regrettable. Therefore, the China Tea Industry Association was launched, with dozens of members from various regions, and the association was temporarily located in Shanghai. Recently, Mr. Wang Zhenhuan, chairman of the association (manager of the local Wang Yifa Tea Company), believed that without local tea industry groups as the backbone and without close contact with political and business leaders, it would be difficult to plan for the development of practical affairs. Therefore, the association held a tea party at its main office on Fuxu Road the other day, inviting Director Cai Wuji of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, Tea Inspection Director Wu Juenong, Director Zhang Yujiu of the International Trade Bureau, Director Zhu Yinong of the Guidance Office, and representatives of the Shanghai Foreign Tea Industry Association, Tea Manufacturing Industry Association, Crude Tea Industry Association, and Store Tea Industry Association. They all agreed that the Chinese tea industry urgently needs to be improved, and that it is urgent to unite political and business circles and share academic experience to jointly promote the development of the tea industry. They all unanimously agreed to join the association. The various associations have separately donated large sums of money to enrich the annual fund. Directors Cai and Zhang stated that in addition to joining and supporting the association's affairs in their personal capacity, they are also willing to introduce other banking groups and academic circles to join and jointly promote development. It is said that the organization will be formally expanded soon.</p>

<p>Request Severance Pay and Pension</p>
<p>Da Gong News Agency reports that the Third China Coal Ball Factory on Daliangwan Road and Tangshan Road in Hongkou was established in November 1929. The general manager is Liu Hongsheng and the factory director is Qiu Guozhen. The annual profit is more than 100,000 yuan. Recently, due to sluggish business, the factory announced the suspension of operations on the 29th of last month and gave workers two months' severance pay. The workers believed that this did not comply with government regulations. After repeated requests, there was no result. The workers, due to difficult livelihoods, were unable to maintain their lives. Yesterday, they specially sent representatives Wang Changshan, Qiang Menggen, Sun Xuefu, Sun Youcai, etc., to the city party headquarters to petition with a memorial. Fan Guoren, a cadre of the People's Movement Section, received them. The workers put forward that since the factory has annual profits and has suspended operations and laid off workers for no reason, they should be required to provide 17,500 yuan in severance pay, plus the previously issued 22,000 yuan in pension, so that the workers can temporarily make a living. Fan Guoren said that he would investigate and then verify. The workers then dispersed.</p>

<p>Since the completion of the reorganization of the Baojia system in Shanghai County, the 36 township and town leaders of the county have already graduated from provincial training in two batches. The Bao heads have also completed their training by the county government. However, the Jia heads have not yet been trained. Recently, the county government originally intended to hold the training. However, since it is the busy farming season, although there are many Jia heads, it is feared that it will be difficult to report in full. Also, the 25th year is about to end. Therefore, under the decision of County Chief Ye, training will begin next year. In addition to reporting the situation to the province, all districts are instructed to be informed.</p>

<p>Yu Jitang Has Been Detained in the French Concession, Transferred to the Public Security Bureau Due to the Case Occurring in the Chinese Territory</p>
<p>Wang Ziwen, a local resident, 46 years old, has been running a Maoshun grocery store at No. 26 North Street, Xujiahui Town, West Shanghai, also selling rice straw. He is doing well in business. His wife, Mrs. Huang, gave birth to four daughters. The youngest daughter, Xingxing, is only two years old and is currently being nursed by Zhang Chen, a Jiangyin native, at No. 2 Tong'an Lane, Qian Hu's residence. Wang has a nephew, Yu Jitang, 22 years old, who is known for his low character and idleness. Since he lost his mother at a young age, Wang raised him. He usually works in the store. A month ago, Yu Jitang sold the straw privately and spent the money. He also disappeared. Unexpectedly, the other day (the 23rd), Jitang suddenly came to Tong'an Lane and took his cousin Xingxing away. He did not return that evening. Knowing that something was wrong, they reported it to Wang Ziwen and his wife and then to the police station in charge, requesting an investigation. They also asked people to search everywhere, but there was no sign of her. Until about 1:00 p.m. yesterday, Wang was passing by Xixinqiao, Fada Road, when he saw Yu Jitang whispering with two strangers on the side of the street. Wang grabbed him. The other two escaped. Later, when the patrolman arrived, they took him back to the Songshan Road police station for questioning. Yu confessed that Xingxing was now in the home of Mrs. Zhao Li, a Changzhou woman, on the upper floor of No. 567 Fada Road. The patrol chief sent detectives to bring back Mrs. Zhao Li and witness Xiao Wang, together with Xingxing, to the police station. Because the case occurred in the Chinese territory, the Xuhui police station was notified, and Detective Hu Zongxi brought the offenders back. Yesterday, the chief questioned them separately. According to the plaintiff Wang Ziwen's description of the encounter, the defendant Yu Jitang bowed his head without a word. Mrs. Zhao Li confessed that the girl was brought by Yu and said that her parents had died and there was no one to support her. She paid 3 yuan for the travel expenses. Witness Xiao Wang's confession was the same as Mrs. Zhao Li's. After hearing the confessions, the chief believed that the case involved a cousin abducting his cousin, which was illegal. Therefore, he prepared a document and sent it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for strict punishment according to the law.</p>

<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports that Chinese antiques are exquisite and unparalleled. Foreigners praised them as the most exquisite crystallization of world art. This is no false reputation. Especially since Chinese antiques participated in the British International Art Exhibition last year, the impression given to Westerners is more profound than before. Therefore, the antique industry in our country is gradually showing a booming trend. The original antique market at No. 74 Jiangxi Road seems to be small in scale. Therefore, more than 500 antique dealers have formed a large-scale antique market. The new location is at No. 212 Guangdong Road, a seven-room, three-story Western-style building. It is scheduled to start trading at the new location today and officially open on July 1st.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Patrol Police Accuse Patrol Officer of Assault, etc. <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Hu Jingzu, a patrol policeman from Huai'an stationed at the Rihui Bridge Outpost of the Ximen Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, filed a lawsuit in the local court against Patrol Officer Zhou of the Ximen Branch and Lin Shaoyun of Jianyi Wood Store at No. 1184 Xuxie Road, Rihui Bridge, for assault. Yesterday, Judge Shao Qinjian held court, and the defendant's lawyer Yan Fangjunjie appeared in court to defend him. Hu Jingzu testified that on the 16th of this month, Guan Baolin came to report that his tenant Lin Shaoyun had been beaten. He brought the assailants Zhao Liancheng and Zhao Lianfu to the station. Later, Patrol Officer Zhou also arrested Su Chunhe. The patrol officer asked Lin to bite me, saying that I had released him at the time. He punched and kicked me, causing serious injuries. I was sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Therefore, I request the law to be enforced. Lin Shaoyun said that the policeman released someone at the time, saying that the detainee's wife was pregnant. Therefore, he let him go. I went to report to the general bureau. I don't know how the policeman was dealt with later. At this point, the official ordered Ran Chuan.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Young Woman Seeks Relatives Unsuccessfully, Encountering a Fellow Townsman Who Rapes Her <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>After Cohabiting, Everything Initially Goes Well, But the Woman Suddenly Changes Her Attitude and Flees with Belongings</p>
<p>Zhang Li, a young woman from Ningbo, 28 years old, used to make a living by farming in her hometown. Because of the bankruptcy of the rural area, her life was difficult. She came to Shanghai to find relatives to help her find work. She arrived in Shanghai on March 25th of this year. Due to negligence, she forgot to bring the address of her relatives in Shanghai, so she could not find them. Since she was unfamiliar with the area, she had to ask the Ningbo Hostel to issue her a boat ticket so that she could return home. Zhang Baogen, a fellow townsman who worked as a boatman, happened to be playing there. Seeing that she was quite attractive, he took the opportunity to seduce her and lied to her that he could introduce her to work. Because she saw that Zhang was a fellow townsman, she did not suspect anything and agreed immediately. That night, she was raped. On April 11th, they rented a house at No. 55 Shunchang Lane, Yangshupu Road, East Shanghai, to cohabit. Everything initially went well. Later, Zhang made several gorgeous clothes for her, spending a lot of money. Recently, the woman suddenly changed her attitude. Last week, she ran away from Zhang, taking many clothes with her. Yesterday at about 2:00 p.m., Zhang was passing by Fangxie Road when he suddenly saw the woman passing by. He immediately went forward to grab her and ordered her to go home. A quarrel broke out, and the nearby patrol police came to ask about the cause. They were taken to the Ximen Branch together. After the branch clarified the cause, because the matter involved fraud and rape, the two sides had different versions of the story. They were sent to the General Public Security Bureau for review.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Dyeing Industry Union Strives to Waive Stamp Duty for Workers' Monthly Fees <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The City Party Department is Requested to Consult the Court Not to Accept the Case, and to Submit a Request to the Central Government for Interpretation of the Trade Union Law</p>
<p>Da Gong News Agency reports that the Shanghai Dyeing and Weaving Industry Union's receipts for monthly fees paid to workers were deemed by stamp tax inspectors to have failed to affix stamp duty. The union filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai Local Court. This matter affects the affairs of workers' groups. Based on Article 34 of the Trade Union Law, which stipulates that trade unions are exempt from income tax, business tax, and registration tax, a request was submitted to the City Party Department to consult the court not to accept the case, and to submit a request to the central government for interpretation, in order to uphold the law. The original presentation is as follows: "We hereby present that the receipts of trade unions which should not be affixed with stamp tax, please consult the court not to accept the case, and please submit the request to the Central Government for interpretation, so as not to affect the entire labor industry. It is found that Article 34 of the fourth section of the protection clauses of the Trade Union Law stipulates, 'Trade unions are exempt from income tax, business tax, and registration tax.' The monthly fees collected by trade unions from workers and the receipts issued are not comparable to business bills and receipts. The exemption provisions have been clearly stipulated in the legal articles. Now, the stamp tax enforcement inspection agency of Shanghai City is ignorant of the law and recklessly regards the monthly fee receipts issued by the union to the workers of Ruihe Dyeing Factory on Lumeng Road, South City, as failing to affix stamp duty, violating the criminal law. The receipts were used as evidence and a lawsuit was filed in the Shanghai Local Court. The court did not refer to the labor laws and regulations, and did not criticize them, but accepted the examination. After the first summons, in addition to responding to the court in accordance with the law, the union submitted a request to the General Labor Union to consult the court and notify the trade unions of various industries, so as to avoid being subject to the same case. Unexpectedly, the court still summoned the union on June 24 and scheduled a hearing for June 30. The provisions of the Trade Union Law are very clear and do not allow for argument. However, the stamp tax inspectors have no common sense of the law. This matter concerns the future of the entire Chinese labor movement. The union has now taken the brunt of it. In order to respect the central laws and regulations and to protect the labor movement, we cannot remain silent. Therefore, we specially present this request to your department to consult the Shanghai Local Court to dismiss this case, and to criticize the stamp tax inspection agency. Now that this matter has already occurred, the latter will follow one after another, which is inevitable. In order for the national labor organizations to implement the law, please submit the request to the Central Government for detailed interpretation and public announcement in the newspapers, so that all sectors of society can understand. This is our sincere prayer."</p>

<p>Zhang Daqian's Tiger Cub to Arrive Next Year, Difficult to Obtain Giant Elephant from Hong Kong Merchant</p>
<p>The Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road sent staff member Bao Hong to negotiate with Suzhou painters and calligraphers Zhang Daqian and Zhang Zhuo to transfer their tiger cub. Although the Zhang brothers have agreed to donate the tiger cub to the zoo, their sons are currently using the tiger as a model for studying tiger painting. Therefore, the time for the actual donation will have to wait until next year. In order to meet the needs of visitors, the zoo has wired Nanyang to find a replacement. At the same time, after the death of the giant elephant, the zoo also entrusted Hong Kong animal traders to search for a giant elephant, but they have not yet been able to find one. As for the zoo's opening hours, they have been slightly changed due to the summer season. Yesterday, on the occasion of the Dragon Boat Festival, the number of visitors to the zoo suddenly became crowded.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Creditors of the Standard Milk Company Resolve to Seek New Buyers <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Standard Milk Company at No. 60 Nanxun Road, with a capital of 200,000 yuan, began selling and modifying milk in June of the year before last. The business was quite good for a time. Later, due to differences between Chinese and foreign shareholders, excessive spending by foreigners, and poor turnover, the British court ruled in May of this year that all business and assets should be sold. All debts will be cleared by the seller and will not be related to the buyer. According to a report at a meeting of creditors at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, a Westerner submitted a bid to purchase the company and continue operations for 30,000 yuan. However, the price was too low. The machinery alone is worth 60,000 yuan. Even with depreciation by half, it is still worth 30,000 yuan. Therefore, creditor Lu Meiseng proposed and passed on the spot that the deadline be extended by two days to seek a Chinese buyer. If someone submits a higher bid by the 16th, they can purchase all of the company's assets and business. For more details, please contact Mr. Hower, the person in charge of the company.</p>

This exhibition features sixty-six of Gao's finest works, including his representative works from the first period, "Autumn Wind," the second period, "Mad Prayer," and the third period, "Green Willows in Misty Haze," all crafted with exquisite skill, with rich colors and a particularly bold and elegant brushstroke. There are also one hundred works by his accomplished students, including Fang Rending, Rong Dakui, Dong Aihong, and Wu Gonghu, all of whom have captured Gao's spirit. In addition, there are seventy ancient paintings from the Ming and Qing dynasties collected by Gao. The exhibition is being held at the 2nd floor of the International General Assembly Hall, No. 722 Jing'an Temple Road. The exhibition will run until the 28th, with viewing hours from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM daily. Admission tickets are sold at the entrance for fifty cents each.</p>

<p>Results of Trustee Solicitation; Court Will Continue to Convene Creditors' Meeting; Settlement Plan Will Also Be Revised</p>
<p>In the case of Xu Qizhong's bankruptcy due to a romantic affair, several creditors, including Sincere Company, appointed lawyer Yue Junwei to file a criminal lawsuit with the court, which hindered the bankruptcy proceedings. Now, the First Special District Court has concluded the trial and sentenced Xu Qizhong to probation. At the same time, Ying Huizhen (i.e., Wen Diji's main creditor) also filed a separate lawsuit due to a dispute over the amount of the debt. The court has ruled that the amount of the loan is 10,000 yuan. The details have been reported in the newspapers. A Datong News Agency reporter provides a follow-up report below:</p>
<p>Continued Creditors' Meeting</p>
<p>The court appointed Wang Sifang, a certified public accountant, as the bankruptcy trustee. Because several creditors, including Sincere Company, had filed criminal lawsuits, the case had now been concluded. At that time, the debtor expressed a willingness to revise the settlement plan and add 15,000 yuan, comprised of shares of Wanxing Real Estate Company pledged by the bankrupt's family, to the revised settlement. In order to resolve the case as soon as possible, a letter was sent to lawyer Yue Junwei to seek agreement not to appeal. Lawyer Yue has already responded on behalf of Sincere Company and other creditors, agreeing not to appeal (letters are recorded separately). Therefore, CPA Wang can report to the court and request that the creditors' meeting be reconvened to proceed with the settlement.</p>
<p>CPA Wang's Letter</p>
<p>To whom it may concern: Our firm, appointed by the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Court as the bankruptcy trustee for Xu Qizhong, has recently received a letter from the bankrupt, Xu Qizhong, stating that his lawyer, Yu Zhongluo, has informed him that regarding the civil lawsuit filed by Ying Huizhen to confirm the debt amount and the criminal lawsuit filed by Sincere Company, a decision has been reached by all parties involved to mutually waive the right to appeal. They urgently request that the creditors' meeting be reconvened, and because the current situation has changed slightly, they request that the settlement plan be revised and sent directly to you for review and processing. A revised settlement plan is enclosed for your review and further legal action. Therefore, we hereby request that you consult with your clients regarding whether to appeal the criminal lawsuit judgment related to the bankruptcy, so that we can submit a request to the court to schedule a creditors' meeting to proceed. We await your reply. Sincerely, Wang Sifang, CPA.</p>
<p>Lawyer Yue's Reply</p>
<p>To whom it may concern: We acknowledge receipt of your letter requesting that this lawyer consult with my client, Sincere Company, regarding whether to appeal the criminal lawsuit judgment related to the bankruptcy of Xu Qizhong. After consulting with my client, they stated that the company accounts for a small minority of the total number of creditors. Now that we have received the trustee's letter stating that the settlement plan has been revised, this company can only abandon the appeal for the sake of the interests of all creditors. Please inform CPA Wang for review and processing. Therefore, we are responding with this letter for your reference. Sincerely, Yue Junwei, Lawyer.</p>

<p>Chang, an employee of the China Telegraph Administration in Qingdao, redeemed a prostitute named Wu Ying for 300 yuan. Last October, Chang was transferred to Shanghai and brought Wu with him, living at No. 4 Hengqing Lane, Tiantong Road. Their relationship was harmonious. However, this April, the madam Wang Li of the Ruqin brothel at No. 35 Xinhui Lane, Fuzhou Road, ordered Wu to go there. Since then, Wu has repeatedly failed to return home. Wu suddenly claimed that she needed to send her mother back to her hometown and left without a trace. On the 22nd of last month, Chang received a report from his cohabitant surnamed Zhou that Wu Ying was now soliciting clients at Ruqin brothel. On the 28th, Chang went to the brothel to negotiate with Wang Li, demanding that Wu return home, but was refused. Helpless, Chang filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian Hongye summoned Wang Li, but she did not appear. Her son, Wang Yongbin, appeared in her place, claiming that Wu Ying voluntarily came because she could not bear Chang's abuse. Wu confirmed this statement. Judge Qian reviewed the statements and, considering it necessary for Wang Li to appear in court in person, ordered a postponement for another hearing.</p>

Zhang found them in a lane at the end of West Baoxing Road the other day. Lin, Zhu, and Shi were planning to go to another port, so Zhang forced Wang to return to the Lao Beimen Police Station by car for questioning. According to Zhang and Lin, her husband was too old and the matchmaker had concealed this fact. She now does not want to live with him. Zhu and Shi stated that they were close to Lin and advised her to go home, with good intentions. Zhang, however, accused them of conspiring to entice her away.

<p>Investigation Leads to Arrest</p>
<p>At 8:20 PM on May 1, a person living in the kitchen shed at No. - Connaught Road hired a rickshaw driven by Wang Liuhu to transport bottles and jars. Unexpectedly, the rickshaw caught fire only a few steps away because the items being transported were flammable liquids such as imitation brandy.

The fire department arrived, extinguished the fire, and took the poisonous substances from the rickshaw to the police station for investigation. After investigating the runaway passenger, Zhu Mengwei, a Chinese detective from the Gordon Road Police Station, and his assistant, Lu Gendi, learned that Zheng Zhenchuan (21 years old), a Chaozhou native living at No. 22 Pi Shao Nai Road in the French Concession, was a major suspect in the case. They went to the French Concession to arrest Zheng and bring him back to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the suspect, Zheng Zhenchuan, is from Chaozhou and does not speak Shanghai dialect. The police need an interpreter and must find the rickshaw puller, Wang Liuhu, and the second landlord, Tao Chuntao, of No. 400 Connaught Road, to identify him.

<p>Yesterday was Children's Health Guidance Day for the 15th Shanghai Municipal Health Campaign. The event was organized by the Public Education Center. At 2:00 PM, junior students from Yangzheng Elementary School were invited to participate in a children's health performance. There was a simple backdrop on the stage of the Minglun Hall. When the curtain opened, the elementary school students performed according to the program, which consisted of six acts: Getting up, showing diligence and habits; Sweeping and cleaning, showing the spirit of labor; Children lecturing on dietary hygiene, showing dietary moderation; Games, jump rope, bouncing a ball, kicking a shuttlecock, showing that games are closely related to health, and warning against bad habits such as playing marbles and rolling money; Etiquette, showing the spirit of friendship and mutual assistance; Harmonica ensemble, playing songs such as "Departure Song" and "Parasite Grass." The meeting ended after the performance. According to the person in charge of the center, the reason for not inviting experts to lecture on Children's Health Guidance Day is that children have a deep understanding of health. Hearing it from the mouths of children makes it more relevant to the facts and more credible. In addition to public health training and health exhibitions, the central activities of the meeting continued to include radio broadcasts and lectures. Guo Qiyuan from the Municipal Radio Station, Chen Tiesheng from the Gospel Radio Station, and Jiang Hao from the Sino-Western Radio Station gave lectures. Today's program is a Stop Spitting Campaign, scheduled to be held at 1:00 PM, and will be hosted by the Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association.

While detained in the foreign disease ward attached to the Guangci Hospital within the detention center, he instigated fellow inmates Zhao Guangfu, Zhang Tinggui, and others to commit perjury and retract their confessions, hoping to escape the death penalty. The High Court discovered this and suspended the trial, referring the newly discovered perjury case to the Prosecutor's Office of the Special Second Court for investigation and prosecution according to law. The investigation is still ongoing. While in the foreign disease ward, Gu also committed the offense of bribing the warden to obtain opium for smoking. This was reported by inmate Wang A'er and others. The Prosecutor's Office of the Special Second Court investigated and prosecuted the warden, Jia Furong, and Wu Lu, for dereliction of duty. Regarding Gu Zhuxuan's smoking, the police department prosecuted him in the Special Second Court. Although Gu denied smoking during the trial and no evidence of opium addiction was found by the forensic doctor, the presiding judge, based on the confiscated evidence of opium pipes and smoking paraphernalia, as well as the accusers' statements, sentenced Gu to eight months of imprisonment. Jia, Wu, and Gu, all three defendants, refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court in accordance with the law. The Third Branch of the High Court had already concluded the trial of Gu Zhuxuan and Wang Xinggao's murder appeal case on the 20th of this month, both in the morning and afternoon, and scheduled the sentencing for 2:00 PM on the 26th (the day after tomorrow). Details have been published in this newspaper. The appeal case concerning Jia, Wu, and Gu's dereliction of duty and opium-related charges was scheduled for trial yesterday afternoon. The High Court and the police department, considering the gravity of Gu's case, notified the judicial police chief to dispatch detectives to ensure security. At three chimes of the bell, Zhu Huanbiao, acting president of the Third Branch of the High Court, along with Judges Shi and Liao, and Prosecutor Dong Qiming, arrived at the Third Criminal Court for the trial. Gu Shouxi, representing the police department, and the defense lawyers selected by the appellants, appeared in court on time. The court ordered Gu Zhuxuan, Jia Furong, and Wu Lu to be brought to the court. After questioning their ages, professions, and addresses, the court announced that for the convenience of the trial, Gu Zhuxuan's opium smoking case and Jia Furong and Wu Lu's dereliction of duty case would be combined. The court ordered the bailiffs to take Jia and Wu down first and then asked Gu Zhuxuan to state his reasons for appeal. Gu claimed, "While detained in the foreign disease ward, I did not smoke. I used to socialize outside and became addicted to smoking at the age of thirty-eight. But while I was sick, I didn't want to smoke anymore. I was arrested and fell ill five days after being released from the hospital. The doctor told me to take Puzi Lingwan pills, and then the Guangci Hospital gave me white powder." When asked what illness he had when he was transferred back from the foreign disease ward to the prison, he answered, "My stomach was bloated and uncomfortable. I was afraid my old addiction was acting up, so Dr. Hu gave me medicine to drink." When asked, "On June 1st, this court received a report from the acting warden and the warden's office, stating that the medical officer examined you and found that your muscles and bones ached and your legs and feet were uncomfortable at night. When questioned, you replied that you had been smoking for three years, and it was the addiction acting up," he answered, "I was taking medicine powder every day in the foreign disease ward. After being transferred to the prison, I didn't take it, so I fell ill." The judge instructed Gu, "You have a reputation and personality in the business world. Why are you unwilling to admit it in this court? Are you afraid of implicating Jia and Wu?" Gu replied, "No, I did smoke when I was outside. I haven't smoked since I was in the detention center, and I'm not trying to cover it up." The judge further instructed, "The government is now banning smoking and drugs, and it is allowing smokers to reform and quit. Since you were addicted, why didn't you honestly report it and quit, instead of taking substitute drugs? If you had quit, you would have been detoxified long ago, considering how long you have been in custody." He also asked about the four opium pipes and a bamboo tube found by Section Chief Ouyang Sen in the disease ward on December 24th last year, and that the forensic doctor proved that the bamboo tube contained opium residue. Gu replied, "They were not found on my person or in my bed. I don't know where they were found." When asked, "Did you order Wu Lu to buy opium for you and give him five yuan? Each yuan could buy four pieces of opium," Gu answered, "No." When asked, "Did your nanny bring you food one day and say that opium was also inside? Warden Jia was also nearby when she said this," Gu answered, "No. When things were brought from home, detectives and Annamite constables were watching by the side." At this point, Jia Furong was brought to the court and ordered to state his reasons for appeal. Jia claimed that he refused to accept the five-year sentence for dereliction of duty for covering up smoking. He said that Section Chief Ouyang Sen found the opium pipes based on Wang A'er's report. Wang was digging a hole to escape, and Warden Duan discovered it. After questioning Wang, he learned that the foreign disease ward contained prisoners, wardens, and constables, making it very complicated. "I only oversee and watch over prisoners to prevent fights or escapes. I don't know who the opium pipes belonged to. Only the mothers can enter the ward three times a day to deliver tea and water. Guo Shanyu and Li Heshang extorted and argued with Gu Zhuxuan. I stopped them and they resented me and accused me. Liu Mingjing's fingers were also yellow because he smoked cigarettes for him. I saw it and reprimanded him, and he also resented me and accused me of covering up smoking. When family members deliver things to prisoners, they can only reach the first iron gate. After inspection, they can be delivered inside. The inspection cannot be concealed under the eyes of detectives and constables. I did not use soap to make a key to open the small room door and let Gu smoke. The bamboo tube that was found also did not have a pipe bowl. Wang A'er took the bamboo tube out from the toilet. This evidence is not complete. I ask for a clear judgment." When asked why Gu did not show signs of withdrawal for a long time in the foreign disease ward, but showed signs of withdrawal two days after being transferred back to the prison, suggesting that Gu smoked in the disease ward, Jia replied, "I have been away from the disease ward for three or four months. I don't know." Then, Wu Lu was brought to the court and ordered to state his reasons for appeal. Wu claimed, "Because inmate Wang A'er attempted to escape and was brought back, he said he stole opium pipes. The section chief's report based on his report is untrue. I serve in the foreign disease ward, but I don't enter the wards. I only inspect the things brought by the prisoners' family members. I inspect in front of the constables assigned by the police station. I did not see any prisoners smoking in the ward, and I did not buy opium for Gu and deliver it through the window. If I had done such a thing and evidence was found, the warden would have notified my chief and punished me. But at that time, it was not mentioned that I was involved. I was detained two months later. It's really unfair." At this point, the court ordered Wang A'er, prisoner number 133, to testify. He said that he lived in the same ward as Gu Zhuxuan and saw Gu smoking in the small room twice a day, after lunch and dinner. He also saw Gu give money to Warden Wu to buy opium, and Wu gave Gu tin foil packages through the window twice. The court then repeatedly questioned the three appellants and Wang A'er, and then considered that the investigation was over and the facts were clear. It ordered the opening of arguments. First, the prosecutor presented his opinion on the two cases, followed by the police department's lawyer and Gu Zhuxuan's defense lawyer arguing. Then, Li and Gao, the lawyers for Jia and Wu, argued. The court declared the arguments in the two cases closed and scheduled the sentencing for 2:00 PM on the 26th. The appellants were remanded to custody separately. The court adjourned at almost eight chimes of the bell.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Lin Huijuan Sues Ma Zonglian for Seduction and Abandonment; She Became Pregnant After Being Seduced, But Was Ordered to Have an Abortion; Ma Zonglian Had to Pay an Additional 1,000 Yuan in Bail <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Lin Huijuan, the 19-year-old daughter of Lin Yan, a woman living in Maojia Lane in the Nanshi district, was seduced last year by Ma Zonglian, a young man from Hangzhou living on Xundao Street. He wrote a letter stating that he would never abandon her and would never have a relationship with anyone else. If he broke his promise, he would pay 10,000 yuan in damages. The woman therefore submitted to his sexual advances, using a hotel as their "balcony," eight times, resulting in pregnancy. Her mother discovered this and investigated, and the daughter and Ma discussed a resolution to become husband and wife. However, Ma's mother ordered the woman to have an abortion before the marriage, leading the woman's mother to believe that he was unscrupulous. They filed a lawsuit in the local court. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution. Yesterday, Judge Wu held a hearing. Lin Huijuan testified in detail about being seduced and abandoned. She also said that after the lawsuit was filed, Ma Mengxi came to her and offered 500 yuan for living expenses, with further discussions later. But she said that this person was unscrupulous, and since she had been defiled and was pregnant, with no future prospects, she did not want the money and preferred to request strict punishment. The defendant, Ma Zonglian, initially denied the accusations, but then admitted that this had happened, and said that Yuan Shixing had discussed a settlement, but the amounts differed greatly. The judge said that a criminal settlement was not possible in this case, but the parties could negotiate a settlement for the damages claimed by the woman outside of court. The judge ruled that because the previously submitted bail bond was not sufficient for the seriousness of the case, Ma Zonglian must pay an additional 1,000 yuan in bail, pending review. The judge also ordered Ma Mengxi and Yuan Shixing to be summoned to court next time to inquire about the settlement status.</p>

<p>Zhong Huisheng, a Guangdong woman, originally a concubine of a wealthy family, became acquainted with a Cantonese man named Chen Qichang in August of last year. After several months, for some unknown reason, she suddenly lied that she had to go to Guangzhou and avoided meeting Chen. Recently, Chen suddenly learned that Ms. Zhong was currently living in the Mei family's home at No. 5 Yunshoufang, Lane 718, Yuyuan Road. He sent a letter to that address, asking Zhong to reaffirm their previous oath, or else he would expose the inside story to society. After the letter was sent, there was no reply. Chen then went to No. 5 Yunshoufang at 9:00 PM the day before yesterday, carrying a square box and two round cigarette cans, to inquire about Zhong's whereabouts. The homeowner, Mei Jinshi, told him that Ms. Zhong Huisheng did not live there and that she did not know her whereabouts. But Chen refused to believe her and pestered her endlessly, saying that if she did not provide him with accurate information, then what he had brought today were all bombs, and they would all die together. Mei Jinshi was greatly alarmed when she heard this and immediately ordered someone to report to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Chinese Detective Zhang Liang and Western Detective rushed to the scene and found Chen lying on the sofa with blood flowing from his head. It was determined that Chen had stabbed himself with a kitchen knife, causing two injuries. He was immediately sent to the Red Cross Hospital. Doctors determined that the trachea was not damaged and transferred him to the Municipal Council Hospital. It was still difficult to determine whether the two cigarette cans were bombs, so they were taken back to the police station and placed in water. After a sufficient amount of time had passed, they would be investigated. The square box was found to contain medicinal water and cotton. Yesterday morning, Qian Xunjiu, the police station's lawyer, charged Chen in the First Special Court's Second Criminal Court under Article 305 of the Criminal Law. However, Chen was unable to leave the hospital to attend the court for questioning, so he requested a postponement. Judge Fu Lin briefly questioned Mei Jinshi and ordered a postponement.</p>

<p>Bao Bingkun, the manager of Tonghe Money Exchange, sued Li Shenfu, the deputy manager, for embezzlement in the Shanghai Local Court. According to the lawsuit, the money exchange was jointly operated by Bao, Li, Lu Xunxian, and others. It closed down in January of this year, and Li Shenfu was responsible for liquidation. However, he committed fraud, embezzled a contract with the Continental Bank, and falsely inflated the accounts by more than 2,000 yuan, for a total of more than 6,000 yuan to be recovered. Li Shenfu had been detained. Yesterday, he hired lawyer Wang Kanghou to defend him in court. The judge announced the verdict that Li Shenfu was guilty of embezzlement and sentenced him to six months of imprisonment. The attached civil suit was transferred to the Civil Court. The lawyer requested bail during the appeal period. The judge ordered a bail of 2,000 yuan. Li repeatedly pleaded for a reduction in the bail, and it was released with a bail of 1,000 yuan each, along with a seven year sentence</p>

<p>Ye Yuxi, a Chinese detective of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, and detective Dong Qingquan, learned that someone was selling the drug "red pills" for profit at No. 304 of the same road. They sent an informant with a "double-corner" coin with a secret mark to purchase the pills. The purchase was confirmed. At 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, they secretly went with a Western detective to the address and arrested Jie Yuquan, a native of Taixing. They also saw his wife, Ji, lying idle in bed, with a set of red pills, a pipe, and a lamp nearby, about to take the pills. They confiscated three large bags and twelve small bags of red pills, totaling 1,830 pills, as well as 96 empty red pill bags, banknotes, corner tickets, and copper coins totaling more than six yuan, and a large bamboo tube. Upon questioning, it was stated that the red pills were purchased from Zhao Yuan, a woman at No. 60, Lane 166, East Jiaxing Road. The detectives escorted Ji to arrest her, but she suddenly changed her statement, saying that it was not this woman, but Chen Zhou, an old woman from Haiyan who worked at the cigarette paper shop at No. 247, Oujia Road. They went to arrest the old woman, but no red pills were found. They took everyone to the police station and detained them separately. Yesterday morning, Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Municipal Council, described the case in detail to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court and requested an investigation. The Chinese and Western detectives then reported the details of the case and presented the evidence. Upon questioning Jie Yuquan, his testimony was evasive. Jie Ji admitted to taking the pills for medical reasons. Chen Zhou claimed that she was a servant in the cigarette paper shop, was 65 years old, and would not dare to commit such an illegal act. She said that Jie Ji was falsely accusing her and asked for judgment. Judge Xiao Xiefen sentenced Jie Yuquan and Jie Ji to seven years of imprisonment each. The evidence was confiscated, and Chen Zhou was released.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security and Health Bureaus jointly issued a notice to citizens, stating that since the "Restaurant Management Regulations" were promulgated in the city, many have faithfully followed them, but some have not fully complied. As summer has arrived, all restaurants should pay close attention to hygiene in order to prevent epidemics. The most important points of the regulations are listed below for compliance. Those who deliberately violate them will be strictly investigated and punished. In addition to ordering the subordinates to conduct inspections of each store, a special notice is issued for general information. The main rules are: Do not sell stale food. Food must be covered with gauze to prevent flies and gnats. Bowls, chopsticks, and utensils must be boiled and wiped clean. Toilets must be clean and should use disinfectant, and must be far away from the kitchen. Do not hire those with infectious diseases as employees. In addition to distributing the above articles and notices by area on the next two days, it was also decided to conduct inspections of public places between the 27th and 28th. According to the person in charge of the Health Bureau, the inspection procedures are currently being coordinated with the Public Security Bureau. The standards have also been set, which can be roughly divided into three categories: Whether the building is dangerous and whether the sunlight and air are flowing, whether the facilities are clean and whether the goods are domestic, and whether the personnel employed are neat, clean, and polite. It is reported that the inspectors will be composed of health inspectors, police officers, boy scouts, and security corps, and will be directed by the Youth Service Corps. The inspection should be conducted in a way that does not hinder normal business operations. For example, theaters and bathhouses should be inspected in the morning.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Kang Xiangrong, Purchasing Agent of Reqi Foreign Firm, Accused of Abandonment by Concubine <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Plaintiff Hospitalized, Seeking Over 40,000 Yuan in Medical Expenses</p>
<p>Kang Xiangrong, a hardware and medicine purchasing agent for Reqi Foreign Firm on Reqi Road, has worked at the firm for many years and accumulated considerable wealth. Recently, a Ningbo woman named Kang Shi Jinying (age 30), residing at No. 52, Dazhong Lane, Tongfu Road, engaged lawyer Li Baosen to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court, accusing him of abandonment and requesting a judgment ordering him to pay for living expenses and medical care, totaling</p>
<p>National currency of 43,200 yuan. The case was heard by Judge Huang Risheng in Criminal Court No. 8 at 10:30 a.m. yesterday. The defendant Kang Xiangrong did not appear, but engaged lawyer Li Fengshen to appear in court. Lawyer Li Bao, representing the plaintiff, stated that the plaintiff, Kang Shi Jinying, is currently suffering from severe lung disease with swelling of the throat and a critical condition, and is hospitalized in Room 7 of the Chinese Red Cross Hospital, fearing she will soon pass away. Therefore, she could not appear in person today. The lawyer also presented</p>
<p>The intention of the lawsuit, stating that the plaintiff and defendant Kang Xiangrong began cohabitating five years ago, when Shi was only twenty-six. The defendant falsely claimed to be unmarried and willing to take her as his wife, vowing to grow old together. They cohabitated at No. 5, Dazhong Lane, Tongfu Road. For several years, they made countless vows and were extremely affectionate. All household expenses were fully borne by the defendant. Last summer, Shi suddenly fell ill with lung disease and was vomiting blood. The defendant sent her to the Hongqiao Sanatorium for</p>
<p>Three months of treatment, from which she recovered. The medical expenses were also paid by the defendant. Recently, because the plaintiff's lung disease recurred, the defendant immediately became abusive, not only cutting off financial support but also ceasing to visit. The plaintiff suffered greatly from the shock, and her condition worsened accordingly. Attempts to negotiate were unsuccessful. The plaintiff is now hospitalized in the Red Cross Hospital with no funds for medical expenses. Her condition is deteriorating daily, her throat is swollen, she cannot eat, and she is in critical condition. According to the doctor, she will soon pass away. The defendant's behavior clearly</p>
<p>Violates Article 294 of the Criminal Law regarding the crime of malicious abandonment. The lawsuit also includes a civil request for living expenses and medical treatment, at a minimum of 500 yuan per month, for a period of one and a half years, totaling 9,000 yuan. In addition, future living expenses, according to previous payment practice, should be 100 yuan per month, calculated for twenty-eight and a half years, totaling 24,200 yuan, for a combined total of 43,200 yuan. Furthermore, the plaintiff is terminally ill and should be questioned at the hospital. Defendant's defending lawyer Li Fengshen stated that the plaintiff had previously</p>
<p>Filed a lawsuit with your court based on the same facts, which was rejected. Filing a lawsuit again seems procedurally inappropriate. According to criminal law, a case cannot be brought twice and should be dismissed. Furthermore, the purpose of the lawsuit is purely for money. In reality, the plaintiff abandoned the defendant because the defendant repeatedly asked her to return home and cohabitate, but she refused. Last year, the plaintiff was ill and stayed in a special ward in the sanatorium. The medical expenses amounted to over 2,700 yuan after three months of treatment, which can be considered extremely wasteful. Judge Huang ordered the lawyers of both parties to start the debate on the procedure first, and announced that the verdict would be announced on a later date.</p>

<p>At 1:10 a.m. this morning, a fire suddenly broke out in an old wooden furniture store opened by Lao Hubei at No. 9, Beicaishi Street, Xiaobeimen, Nanshi. In a moment, it engulfed the entire building, with thick smoke rising and flames illuminating the sky. It also spread to neighboring houses. Fire brigades from various sections of Nanshi rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm and attempted to put out the fire, which was eventually extinguished.

<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee previously assisted Shaanxi Province due to the severe drought, which had caused consecutive years of crop failure, widespread starvation, and extreme human suffering. In addition to providing emergency relief, they ultimately purchased a large quantity of food grains to transport to Qin, as well as seeds for production and assisted in well-drilling to provide water sources. They also undertook the construction of two major branch canals in northern Wei, which have all been effective. The rivers now flow through an area 36 kilometers long, irrigating 200,000 mu of farmland. Water conservation is reliable, and the annual harvest is several times greater than in the past when relying solely on rain for irrigation.

<h3 id="e136">British Shanghai Public Omnibus Company, Thirteenth Annual Shareholders' Meeting <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Slight Profit Remaining After Interest and Other Expenses, Approximately One Accident per 1.4 Million Miles</p>
<p>The British Shanghai Public Omnibus Company held its thirteenth annual shareholders' meeting at the Sassoon Company, the general manager's office, on Monday. Chairman Arnold presided. The shareholders present represented 145,100 shares. In his report on the company's operations and business conditions during the year, the chairman stated that in 1935, the total number of seats on all the company's buses was 6,127, compared to 5,276 in 1934. Although the number of seats had increased, the total number of passengers had decreased, indicating that the crowding was not as severe as before. According to the average mileage driven, each seat could accommodate 50 passengers per day, so the company's entire fleet could carry 300,000 passengers per day. However, the actual number of passengers carried daily was only about 100,000. At the end of last year, the company had a total of 166 buses, of which 131 were recently manufactured and equipped with diesel oil engines. These new buses accounted for 88% of the net value of the fleet at the end of last year. In 1935, the company's buses traveled a total of 5,148,690 miles, with a serious accident occurring on average every 1,391,50 miles. The year's income, after deducting interest, directors' fees, auditor's fees, and depreciation, left a net profit of 26,568 yuan. After deducting this amount, the company still owed 67,201 yuan at the end of last year, which has been rolled into the 1936 accounts. The profit for 1935 was less than that for 1934, mainly due to changes in the company's depreciation rules and the low value of copper coins. The decrease in passengers by approximately one million also reduced revenue by 18,253 yuan. Fares are still calculated based on copper coins, with 300 coins valued at one yuan. If this rate can be maintained, the income for 1936 will be more substantial. The meeting then unanimously approved the 1935 accounts and elected new directors and auditors before adjourning.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, I have read the "Shanghai News" section of your newspaper on June 15, which reported on "Shen Aizhen and Lin Xingyuan's divorce suit, citing gonorrhea as the reason." One part of the article stated: "The official said to Lin Xingyuan, 'According to the forensic doctor's report, you definitely have gonorrhea.' Lin replied, 'I have chronic gonorrhea, but it can be cured. I ask for your understanding.'" Although Xingyuan went to the forensic doctor's office for examination that day, he was not examined because the forensic doctor's office did not have the necessary instruments. On that day, Xingyuan also did not admit in court that he had gonorrhea. I am afraid that this is inaccurate hearsay, which is very relevant to Xingyuan's reputation. I am therefore writing to request a correction. I respectfully wish you good health. Sincerely, Lin Xingyuan, June 22.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, This is according to what the person concerned, Fei Jinlai, said, I saw in the "Shanghai News" section of Shen Bao, a section that reported that I, Fei Jinlai, had sexually assaulted a young girl, after looking at it, I was horrified, I am afraid that the report in your newspaper is not at all correct. The reasons are that I, Fei Jinlai, am working in the Jingyi Wood Factory, and the factory found earlier that a worker was mixing wood into scrap materials, which was stolen and transported out of the factory. It was learned that this was related to Gao Guangzhou and other workers in the factory. The factory authorities ordered that I, Fei Jinlai, go to Gao Guangzhou's house the next day for investigation. In the end, I, Fei Jinlai, found that the material used for burning in Gao Guangzhou's house was the same as the material from the Jingyi Factory, so I got into an argument with Gao Guangzhou, so Gao was anxious for a while and twisted me around and struck myself with a glass, and reported that I, Fei Jinlai, first beat him etc. Fortunately, the Public Security Bureau found out the truth and released me. Because this matter concerns my personal reputation, please request a correction according to the law, as a public service. Best regards, Shanghai Shen Bao, Lawyer Liu Shifang, June 24.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Shanghai's Oil Extraction Industry <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Edited by China Credit</p>
<p>(Twenty-Ninth in the Series of Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Overviews)</p>
<p>I. Overview: Using plant seeds (mainly rapeseed, cottonseed, sunflower seeds, soybeans, etc.) to make oil cakes and extract the oil content has a long history in our country, but all production is done by hand and the scale is very small. Since the British Taikoo Foreign Firm established a modern oil extraction plant in Yingkou, Northeast China, in the 21st year of Guangxu, the industry in China began to take a new stage. Shanghai was the first city in China to be baptized by modern enterprises, so the Dadde Machine Oil Extraction Plant rose the following year. The plant was funded by Sheng Xuanhuai and managed by Zhu Zhiyao, specializing in the production of cottonseed oil and cottonseed cake. Afterwards, as far as Shanghai is concerned, there were quite a few new-style oil extraction industries that followed, such as the Huashang Dasheng, Lide, Tongchang, Dayou, and Yangshang Zengyu factories, all of which were founded during the Guangxu period. At that time, on the one hand, there were few domestic competitors, and on the other hand, neighboring Japan had not yet paid attention to this, so the development of the industry was quite smooth. However, this smooth development trend soon began to suffer setbacks, for two reasons: one was the irrational domestic tariff system, and the other was that neighboring Japan rose up to imitate and compete. A brief description is given below for the reference of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>According to my country's tariff system at that time, all domestic products purchased and used by Chinese merchants, in addition to paying the regular tax at the place of purchase and loading, must also pay the arrival tax (that is, the tax levied at the place of arrival); when foreign merchants purchased, they only need to pay one tax, which can be directly transported abroad. This is the result of unequal treaty restrictions. At that time, Japan, due to its relatively developed scientific knowledge, already knew that all kinds of oil cakes (mainly cottonseed cakes) were good products for fertilizing fields, and purchased a lot from China every year; later, in view of the fact that oil cakes are the remnants after extracting vegetable oil seeds, their selling price often includes the double tax paid by Chinese merchants on pamphlets, which is not as good as transporting oil seeds out of the country to make oil and cakes themselves, paying a single tax is more advantageous. Therefore, it began to operate new-style oil extraction within the country. Since the 20th year of Guangxu, Japan's cottonseed oil extraction plants have been established one after another, and the threat to the local national oil extraction industry has become increasingly serious, leading to closures and reorganizations. This is not only because Japan can make its own cottonseed oil and cottonseed cake, but also because my country's cottonseed raw materials are purchased in large quantities, resulting in insufficient raw materials for domestic factories. This kind of past historical record should be paid attention to by all those who are concerned about the history of the development of national industry. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, the oil extraction industry has developed, but its momentum is very slow. After the fall of the Northeast, my country's oil extraction industry was even more severely hit. The Northeast is a concentrated production area of soybeans, and the oil extraction industry in Dalian and Shenyang is far superior to that in Shanghai, but now they are no longer ours! Recently, Japan has strengthened its control over Manchurian agricultural products, and at the same time concluded a German-German trade agreement to exchange a large number of soybeans from the Northeast for German ordnance, making our local area even more lacking in these agricultural products. For example, the recent decision of the local tofu industry to raise prices is one of its reflections. Therefore, it is natural that the oil extraction industry in Shanghai (mainly referring to the extraction of soybean oil) will suffer a huge impact, and this is also the way we should plan to prevent it.

<h3 id="e153">Local Organizations of this City Yesterday Gave a Farewell Party to the World Games Delegation; Director Pan, Yang Xiaotian, and Others Gave Speeches; Delegation to Depart Tomorrow Afternoon by Ship <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The delegation representing our country at the World Games is scheduled to depart tomorrow afternoon on the Italian ship Conte Verde. Various circles in this city held a farewell reception at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA yesterday at 4 p.m. Mayor Wu, represented by Director Pan Gongzhan, and others gave speeches. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Participating Representatives: Mayor Wu (represented by Director Pan), Chu Minyi, Li Dachao of the Municipal Government, Tong Xingbai of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Yang Xiaotian of the Garrison Headquarters, Jiang Bai of the Education Bureau, Director Cai of the Public Security Bureau, Wang Xiaolai of the Municipal Council, Song Huanzhang of the China Insurance Company, as well as representatives from the Social Bureau, Municipal Agricultural Association, China Cultural Construction Association, Municipal Sports Association, Municipal Stadium, major Physical Education Associations, Vocational Education Society, YMCA, Jingwu Association, National Arts Hall, Central Research Institute, Local Association, Aviation Association, Diligent Sports Monthly Magazine, Eurasia Aviation Corporation, representatives of over two hundred people from the Two-Roads Bureau, Lingnan University, Jiaotong University, Great China University, Sino-French Institute of Technology, East Asia University, Liangjiang, Commercial Press, Zhongxi Pharmacy, Tianchu MSG Factory, Zhenjiang Fellow Villagers Association, and other groups, including Yu Zhenhui, Zhou Bangjun, Wu Yun Chu, Ma Chonggan, Zhou Hanmei, Wu Zijing, He De Kui, and representatives of various newspapers and organizations.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: Chairman Yang Xiaotian said in his speech, roughly: "You are honored to represent China at the World Games. I am making a small contribution to express my warm send-off. China's technological backwardness in participating in the World Games is undeniable. Therefore, in addition to technical competition, our goal is to pay attention to other people's techniques for observation and learning. At the same time, we should pay special attention to two points in terms of spirit: one is the cultivation of personal character and the maintenance of order in life; the other is the observance of the spirit of unity and public discipline. These two points are the central principles of participating in sports. If we can do this, we will make progress technically. I wish you all to bring back the trophy of victory from the World Games, and I hope to bring the great spirit and culture of the Chinese nation to people all over the world."</p>
<p>Speeches from Various Circles: Tong Xingbai of the Municipal Party Headquarters said in his speech: "Our participation in the World Games should be based on the principle of neither arrogance nor inferiority, to visit the international stage, learn from others' strengths, make up for our shortcomings, and promote our strengths to contribute to the world. We must use facts to show others and improve the country's status. And I hope everyone will pay attention to things other than sports at all times, and carefully note the construction of his spirit as a lesson for the revival of China." Song Huanzhang of China Insurance Company said, "I hope that we will not be proud of our victory, and strive for excellence; if we fail, we do not need to regret, and continue to work hard." He De Kui of the Public Works Bureau said, "In addition to physical health, we should pay attention to mental health, mutual assistance and cooperation, and add glory to the country."</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech: Mayor Wu, represented by Director Pan, said in his speech: "Our country's participation in the World Games does not necessarily mean complete victory, nor can we be discouraged because we may not get a victory. The victory of sports lies entirely in the efforts of ordinary days. This time, we will contribute our ability on the one hand and visit the strengths of others on the other. Of course, it is not a luxury to have to win. Our group can show the spirit of a great country to Germany and the countries we pass through, and it is a great success. Because foreign countries do not understand China, if we show ourselves everywhere as a modern national, we can improve China's international status. This kind of harvest is more valuable than getting a trophy. Therefore, the only hope is that everyone will take care of the national character of the whole country, so that China can improve its international status, and a grand welcome to you all when we return."</p>
<p>Representative's Reply: Finally, Shen Siliang, on behalf of the delegation, replied: "We are very grateful to all circles for the grand farewell today. This trip abroad is a great responsibility. I believe everyone can do their best, and every move will show the good phenomena of the Chinese nation, so as not to disappoint everyone's expectations. China has only paid attention to sports in the past 20 years. I remember that at the World Games eight years ago, our country had no athletes to participate, only one representative. At the World Games four years ago, only one athlete participated. This time, there are more than 70 athletes participating, more than 40 members of the visiting group, and more than 10 staff members, for a total of more than 100 people. The number has increased from one person to more than one hundred in four years, which cannot be said to be progress. This time, the government subsidizes 170,000 yuan, and donations from various parties amount to 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. The cost of going abroad is nearly 250,000 yuan, which is far less than other countries, but I believe that everyone will be able to show some achievements when they go abroad to comfort the people of the country."</p>
<p>Sailing Tomorrow Afternoon: The delegation has decided to sail on the Italian ship Conte Verde at 12:00 noon tomorrow (June 16) at the North Station of the China Merchants Bureau. At that time, representatives from all walks of life will go to the port to say goodbye at 10:00 a.m. The Garrison Headquarters and the Public Security Bureau will send bands to play music, and the Aviation Association will send a plane to see them off to Wusongkou.</p>

<p>The 11th World Games will open in Berlin, Germany on August 1. The delegates representing our country at the meeting, in addition to the government representative Dai Chuanxian, the head of the delegation Wang Zhengting, and the football team who went abroad earlier, are all led by the Secretary-General Shen Siliang, a group of more than 100 people. They will take the Italian ship Conte Verde tomorrow at 12:00 noon to go to Germany. They will board the ship at the North Bureau of the China Merchants Bureau at 11:30. The list of athletes, staff and inspection team is compiled as left.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Wimbledon Tennis Championships, Xu and Lin's Doubles Advance to the Second Week; All Four Chinese Players in Singles Lost; Xu Chengji Narrowly Lost to Hughes <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>London, 23rd (Reuters) - The Wimbledon World Tennis Championships opened yesterday, with no unexpected results. All four Chinese singles players were eliminated. Xu Chengji lost narrowly in five sets to Hughes, a British Davis Cup player. Xu was ahead 6-5 in the fifth set, but Hughes won three consecutive games. Xu's unfortunate defeat is deeply regrettable. In doubles, Xu Chengji and Lin Baohua defeated Ireland's Gaosai'er and Pan Sai'er. Cai Junquan and He Jun were eliminated by Britain's Taowei Huike Luofu. The women's singles began, with some surprises. Britain's Ms. Noel eliminated South Africa's champion Mrs. Ailu Yue, 6-3, 6-1. Germany's Ms. Honn defeated the United States' Mrs. Faping, 6-3, 7-5. Faping had shown great power in the Wightman Cup. Britain's Ms. Gauts defeated Britain's women's indoor singles champion Ms. Skle. Other ladies, Ms. Jackobai, Ms. Stanmo, Ms. Langte, and Mrs. Vanden, all declared victory and advanced to the second week.</p>
<h3 id="e159">World Games, Britain Also Requests to Host the Next Games; Motivation Comes from the Banking Sector <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Havas Agency, London, 23rd - Regarding the location of the 12th Olympic Games in 1940, Britain, Japan, and Finland are now competing. Henry Hunt, Secretary of the British Olympic Association, recently issued a statement on this matter in a private capacity, saying that when the 10th Olympic Games were held in Los Angeles, USA in 1932, most countries advocated that the 1940 Games should be held in Europe again, and the 13th Games in 1944 could be held in other continents. Therefore, when the International Olympic Committee meets to discuss this issue, most countries will naturally oppose Japan and choose one of Britain and Finland to host the 1940 Olympic Games.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, London, 23rd - Regarding the location of the 12th Olympic Games, that is, the next Olympic Games, Japan and Italy have successively requested to hold the Games in their countries, and Finland then followed suit. It is now learned that Britain also intends to make the same request. Although Britain's move may attract the attention of small countries in the European continent, most members of the Olympic Committee may not vote in favor when it is submitted for a vote in the future. The 1908 Olympic Games were originally planned to be held in Rome, but due to Italy's lack of preparation, it was temporarily changed to be held in Britain. At that time, most countries, such as Japan and Finland, had not yet officially participated. It has been 28 years since 1908. If Britain asks to host the next Games at this time, there is nothing wrong with it. However, the winter competition program is inconvenient to be held in Britain, which is a pity for most people. The country may propose to hold the winter competition program in Switzerland, and hold other programs in the country. According to those who are familiar with the details, the proposal for Britain to request to hold the next Games in the country does not originate from the sports world, but is initiated by the banking sector. They expect that the gathering of spectators will triple the British business. Witnessing the grand occasion of the 25th anniversary of the accession of the late King George V last year, they are encouraging the government and are not worried about not having anything to say. However, the major newspapers in the capital are not paying much attention to it.</p>

The trip is expected to last about two weeks. According to Chen Junde on the wheel, the first stop is Hong Kong, and it is expected that there will be about six games. Then to Guangzhou, about seven or eight games can be played. However, the teams that will compete must be contacted after arriving in Hong Kong. This time, Li Yunze (right forward), Zhou Xingyun (left forward), Qiu Guangfan (center forward), Weng Ren'an (right guard), and Chen Zongqi (left guard) will form a basketball team to challenge the strong teams in Hong Kong and Guangdong. This team is going south for the second time, and the players are all strong players in the south. It is not easy to return to their hometown, and all operations should gain the advantage of knowing yourself and your enemy. I will board the Conte Verde in Hong Kong on the 28th to join the World Games visiting team to Europe. All leadership duties will be handed over to the two cadres Xu and Ma and the team leader Li to handle.</p>

<p>The Market Only Trades for One Month in July - Transactions Still Reach Over 8.1 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange stopped trading in June futures to prepare for the settlement on the 26th. Therefore, the market only traded for one month in July. Due to the lack of a settlement in the southwest, the market sentiment was panicked. However, due to the large number of short positions in the market, many people were taking small profits to cover their positions, which slightly triggered a recovery. However, the closing situation was still sluggish. August futures will start trading on the market today, but after deducting five months of interest, the market price should be 2.5 to 3 yuan lower than July. The current situation still needs to evolve, and there will be more fluctuations in the bond market. Yesterday, the market atmosphere was extremely weak when the market opened in the morning. Nos. 4 and 33, etc., had extremely strong selling pressure, but because there were too few buyers, the market price fell unanimously, by as much as 0.4 to 0.8 yuan. Each bond had a new low price. In the next round, retail investors covered their short positions. Although the front rows were still weak, the back rows had risen by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. After the market opened in the afternoon, Nos. 11 and 14, etc., had a lot of buying, and No. 72 also recovered, slightly triggering a recovery. Each bond then recovered by about 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. The closing continued to strengthen, and rose by another 0.2 to 0.3 yuan, but the rising momentum became weaker and weaker. Grade A rose and then fell, and eventually there was no increase or decrease. Therefore, if there are no changes in the situation in the future, the market price, even if it is high, will be limited. Otherwise, it should continue to decline. As a result, only Grade C public bonds rose by 0.25 yuan, and the rest had no increase or decrease. The morning drop and afternoon rise were offset to flat. The total number of transactions was 8,125,000 yuan. The results of the increase and decrease are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and recovered in the afternoon, and the situation is still firm. The market is maintained by the large rise and small pullback in the overseas yarn and cotton market.

Afterwards, the long side closed out, the cloth market was poor, and the needs of industry peers gradually became stagnant.

Production was at its peak season, and the factory's sales volume was very smooth, leading to a more intense decline.

<p>In overseas silk markets, as the June settlement date approaches, there is a squeezing trend in the market. Short covering transactions are surging, causing the prices of New York and Yokohama silk to suddenly rise the day before yesterday (i.e., during the Dragon Boat Festival). Although market prices slightly retreated yesterday, the price of both New York Japanese silk and Chinese silk increased by five cents per pound compared to the day before. Spot prices in Lyon and Yokohama opened at 720 yuan, the same as the previous day; futures were 731 yuan, down about two yuan. New York spot and futures prices fell one to one and a half cents compared to the previous day, but they have already risen about seven cents compared to last Saturday's market price. The Shanghai silk market has therefore become active again. Opinions on price holding are divided among generators and manufacturers. However, if overseas market prices can become increasingly stable, the Shanghai silk market will definitely be better.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Brisk Trading in Black and Green Tea <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trading of black and green tea at foreign firms was exceptionally brisk. A total of over 6,700 chests of Qimen and Anhui black tea and Wuyuan and Tunxi green tea were traded throughout the city. Yesterday, the Tunxi Gaozhuang Zhenmei was quite active, with prices rising imperceptibly. Tianyu, Jinlong, Tongfu, and other firms all made substantial purchases, and after the Baitou firms began to move, the market became even more lively. The highest price sold was 102 yuan, and other chouxin also had sporadic transactions, and the price also held firm. Weizhen has shown a considerable movement trend, and the market can also be expected to have no problems. There were no transactions for Pingshui tea or Zhucha, but Zhenmei also sold quite well. Xiehe and Huacha each purchased five to six hundred chests, with prices ranging from 30 to 35 yuan.</p>

<p>(Medulla Ossea) Because the quality of the new Civilization Drama product is not good, the supply from various mountains has recently decreased, while the business of merchant groups has gradually become more active. The Hunan and Guangdong merchant groups have a strong appetite, and merchants from Jiangxi and Hankou are also active. Therefore, merchants who had previously advanced the goods are now tightening their sales. Yesterday, market prices were rising sharply. The quoted price for Gaozhuang Xinning supplement goods was 25 yuan, unified hand goods were 24 yuan, Gao Chen goods were 34 yuan, ordinary goods were 32 yuan, Yantai Dabeibei medulla ossea was 52 yuan, medium pieces were 50 yuan, and Jiangbei medulla ossea was 45 yuan. Market conditions are very firm.</p>
<p>(Jellyfish) New goods will have to wait until next month to be available on the market. The inventory of old goods is already thin, and selling prices are rising. Currently, the original price of Yangshan goods is 11 yuan, and after processing, it is 11 yuan and 3 jiao. Goods from Sijiao and Huanglong, etc., can be reduced by 5 jiao. In the future, we will see how the new goods from various mountains are produced, and then divide the market's prosperity or decline.</p>
<p>(Squid) New hot-water goods have not yet arrived. Due to the occasional procurement by merchants from Sichuan, Hankou, Shantou, and Guangdong, the old goods in stock have turned upward. Yesterday, the brokerage house opened prices: Jinshan bucket squid, 62 pieces, price 77 yuan; Xiangguan Qiushui squid, market disc selling 85 or 86 yuan. If the new goods are late, there is still a trend of continued increase.</p>

<p>Anhai Brown Sugar Continues to Remain Closed</p>
<p>Yesterday, the currency market trend remained flat and soft, and transactions were few. The association marked the price of No. 24 coarse granulated white spot goods at 22 yuan and 1 jiao, transshipped goods at 6 yuan and 8 jiao, and the quoted prices for Dongchi white, as well as this factory's cotton white, Zhenji, Zhenyu, Dahua, and Jinxin, were as before. Transactions were sparse. The brokerage market only opened for 160 bags of Mianchi sugar from the Chaozhou merchant group, with the higher grade at 12 yuan and 5 jiao and a half, and the lower grade at 12 yuan and 2 jiao to 1 jiao. Anhai red is slightly tighter near the market. Since the brokerage side was unwilling to compromise, and the merchant side was unwilling to add more, a stalemate formed, and no transaction was made.</p>
<p>The joint-stock company reached the second tender exchange period this week, with a total quota of 8,342 bags of Guangdong coarse white, etc. However, as a result of low merchant appetite, only 400 bags were traded. 310 bags of Shunde factory Five Rams coarse white were sold at 21 yuan and 5 jiao, 10 bags of Dongguan factory were also sold at 21 yuan and 5 jiao, 20 bags of sandy white in the city were sold at 19 yuan and 3 jiao, 50 bags of No. 2 cotton white were sold at 20 yuan and 6 jiao, and another 10 bags of No. 4 were sold at 20 yuan and 4 jiao. The original price of Quxi coarse white was not traded.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Wang Sun Jia's Mother <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Kan Ci</p>
<p>—"If a child understands self-reliance, the state of Qi will not perish!"—</p>
<p>In the dim twilight, an old woman with completely white hair, leaning on a cane, stood falteringly at the entrance of an alley. She had been standing there for a long time, her legs aching. When she first came out, the people on the street wore worried expressions, milling about in groups, leading their children and carrying their women, heading northeast (from Ju to Jimo). She had originally wanted to ask if some kind of emergency had occurred, but thinking of a lone city surrounded by enemies, she figured that emergencies were to be expected and didn't ask. Her only hope now was that her son would return soon, so the two of them could be together, putting her mind at ease whether they lived or died. The noisy street prevented her from thinking calmly. She aimlessly looked at this group, then at that group, but no deep impression was made. A streak of beautiful evening sun flashed over the wall, and the scene before her immediately became blurred. At the same time, the number of people on the street dwindled, and the loneliness of dusk made her reflect on everything in the past. She sighed softly, "Alas! If Jia'er's (referring to the old woman's son, Wang Sun Jia) father were still alive, the state of Qi would not be in such a state."</p>
<p>She suddenly remembered something that had happened thirty-one years ago (the first year of King Nan of Zhou – 314 BC) – the day the Qi army broke through the state of Yan, and news of the victory arrived. The Qi court and the general public celebrated as if they were going mad. Some idle politicians and short-sighted military men said, "We in Qi are lucky. If we get Yan, we might be able to replace the Zhou dynasty! We are acting on behalf of the people to punish evildoers and practice the way of the king!" At that time, Wang Sun Jia's father was a minister under King Xuan of Qi. Although he, like other ministers, went to court to offer congratulations, he felt a sense of unease, because he did not agree with Qi's opportunistic and exploitative way of being king. He wanted to say something fair on behalf of the people of Yan, but everyone was so intoxicated with joy that no one would listen to him. He could only stand in the court assembly as if in a daze, pursing his lips without saying a word.</p>
<p>At that time, Mencius happened to be a guest minister in Qi. King Yi of Qi respected him very much and sent Jia's father to invite him to court to discuss the major plan for dealing with the state of Yan. Jia's father was rushed and unable to say much, but on the way, he could only say to Mencius, "Master, please say something fair!" Mencius did not understand his feelings and thought he was just being polite, so he pretended not to hear and didn't even look at him. Because the state of Qi had been prosperous for a long time, it was accustomed to swallowing the weak and bullying the small, creating a deceptive philosophy of the strong: clearly practicing the way of the hegemon, but claiming to be practicing the way of the king; clearly invading others, but claiming to be saving them. Mencius thought that Jia's father's talk of fairness was nothing more than empty rhetoric, so he ignored him.</p>
<p>When Mencius arrived at the court, King Qi rose to greet him and asked him happily, "We have already defeated the state of Yan and corrected that Yan Kuai who brought disaster to the country and harmed the people. Now, some people advise me not to take Yan, while others advise me to take it. I think that attacking a state of ten thousand chariots with a state of ten thousand chariots, and conquering it in fifty days, could not have been achieved by human power alone. I am afraid it is the will of Heaven. Not taking it will surely incur the wrath of Heaven, but what should I do if I take it?" Mencius thought to himself, "Good method! The king is again using the will of Heaven to cover up his tyranny!" He did not want to interrupt King Qi directly, so he answered very tactfully, "If the people of Yan are happy to have you take it, then take it. In ancient times, there was a King Wu who did the same. If the people of Yan are not happy to have you take it, please do not take it. In ancient times, there was a King Wen who did the same." King Xuan of Qi said, "I cannot concern myself with whether the people are happy or not. I only fear that the various states will not allow me to swallow a large country alone and will unite to save Yan." Mencius said, " 'A thousand people pointing fingers, even without illness, one will die.' How much more so with the tens of millions of people of Yan? How can you not care about them? At the same time, it is possible that the various states will form an alliance to plot against Qi. The states were originally afraid of Qi's strength, and now that Qi has doubled in size, it is like a tiger with wings. Each state is in danger, so how can they not unite to attack Qi? If Qi wants to avoid disaster, it must abandon Yan. Please consider this carefully, my King!" After Mencius finished speaking, he bowed and left.</p>
<p>Jia's father believed that everything Mencius said was perfectly reasonable and conveyed it to his wife, Lady Jia, at home, adding some of his own thoughts: "Both Qi and Yan were established very early, and they have been able to exist until today, so of course they have their reasons for existing. How can we be blind to the overall situation, be greedy for merit and profit, and make enemies of the people of Yan? Although they are temporarily subdued by us, they will one day rise up in resistance. When that time comes, Qi will be in trouble! The state of Qin originally had the ambition to annex all under Heaven, and the state of Chu's ambitions are not small either. Han, Zhao, and Wei often base their diplomacy on that of Qin and Chu, so they are rarely reliable. Once the Yan disaster breaks out, Qi will be isolated and may even perish!" Jia's father couldn't help but shed tears.</p>
<p>His wife quickly comforted him, "Sir, the state of Qi will certainly not perish. Please don't be sad!" Jia's father asked, "How do you know?" His wife said, "There is no disaster in the world that cannot be prevented. The most fearful thing is not seeing it beforehand, or seeing it too late, when there is no time to prevent it. You have already seen the root of Qi's disaster. As long as we take preventive measures early, what is there to fear?" Jia's father said, "I know that, but one person's strength is limited. If everyone doesn't cooperate with you, you can't do anything. We are doing something that is opportunistic and exploitative, so everyone is extremely happy. No one will want to hear you say such killjoy things." His wife said, "There's no need to worry about that. No matter what great thing you do, it usually starts with one or two people initiating it, striving and struggling, and gradually attracting attention, gaining support, and creating a new atmosphere that can help this thing succeed. Why don't you become such a pioneer who transforms the atmosphere and awakens the people to save the country?"</p>
<p>Jia's father kept his wife's words in his heart and worked to save Qi with unwavering determination. He also tried to persuade King Xuan of Qi to rein in his ambition to invade and burn others, but unfortunately, King Xuan did not listen, and instead scolded Jia's father, "Mencius is a foreigner, so I don't blame him for not thinking of Qi. You are a person of Qi, yet you say such cold things, you deserve to die!" The king then distanced himself from Jia's father and implemented the annexation of the state of Yan. Unexpectedly, the people of Yan refused to submit and rose up in resistance, driving the Qi army out of their territory. From then on, Yan hated Qi to the bone and plotted to attack Linzi (the capital of Qi) to avenge their humiliation. King Xuan of Qi saw that Jia's father had foresight and gradually came to trust him.</p>
<p>Jia's father paid close attention to the defense against Yan. He often said to King Xuan of Qi, "The King of Yan has the ambition of Goujian to avenge Wu. On the surface, he is still on good terms with us, but in his heart, he is difficult to fathom. We must be on guard. I hope that Your Majesty will repair our internal affairs, strengthen our border defenses, and treat our neighboring countries generously so that Yan has no opportunity to exploit. Only then can Qi avoid disaster. Qi is surrounded by crises today, and it is not a time for us to rest easy. I urge Your Majesty to intensify our preparations!" King Xuan indeed listened to Jia's father and worked hard to improve governance.</p>
<p>On the other side, the King of Yan (Kuai's son, King Zhao) was indeed like King Goujian of Yue, enduring hardship and biding his time. He wore tattered clothes, ate coarse food, and saved money to support orphans and widows, cultivate young people, and work hard to rebuild the broken state of Yan. Then, he humbled himself, offered generous gifts, and recruited talented people, seeking ways to take revenge. At that time, there was a wise man in Yan named Guo Wei. The King of Yan went to his home to ask for advice, saying, "Qi took advantage of the internal strife in our country and took the opportunity to attack and break through Yan. Not a single person in Yan does not consider this a disgrace and hate Qi to the core. I know that Yan is small and lacks strength, making it difficult to take revenge on Qi. I wish to work together with wise men to govern the country and wash away the shame of our former kings. I don't know how to avenge the state's enmity. Please, sir, instruct me!"</p>
<p>Guo Wei saw that the King of Yan had respectfully come to him for advice, so he frankly told him, "The most important thing is to obtain talented people. The one who associates with an emperor is his teacher; the one who associates with a king is his friend; the one who associates with a hegemon is his minister; the one who associates with the ruler of a fallen kingdom is his servant. If you break down your prejudices, treat people with humility, and receive instruction from the north, then someone a hundred times better than yourself will come; if you walk before others and rest after others, first asking for instruction and then remaining silent, then someone ten times better than yourself will come; if others walk before you and you follow behind, then someone equal to yourself will come; if you lean on your armrest, lean on your cane, don't even look at people, and arbitrarily order people around, then only servants will be willing to come; if you lose your temper and beat and scold people, then only slaves will be willing to come!—This is the method of attracting scholars in ancient times. If the King can truly widely select the wise men in the country and hold audiences with their followers, and the world hears that the King holds audiences with wise ministers, then many wise men will surely flock to Yan." King Zhao said, "Who should I hold audiences with?" Guo Wei said, "I have heard that in ancient times, there was a ruler who offered a thousand pieces of gold to find a thousand-mile horse, but he could not find one for three years. His eunuch said to him, 'Please send your servant out to find one!' The ruler then sent him out. This eunuch spent three months and indeed found a thousand-mile horse. But unfortunately, this horse had already died, so he spent five hundred pieces of gold to buy the horse's bones and report back. When the ruler saw this, he was very angry and said, 'I want a living horse, why spend five hundred pieces of gold to buy a dead horse?' The eunuch replied, 'You are willing to spend five hundred pieces of gold to buy a dead horse, how much more so for a living horse? All those who sell good horses will surely say that the King is able to buy horses and will send good horses to you.' Sure enough, before a year had passed, people were sending three thousand-mile horses to sell. If the King truly wants to attract scholars, please start with Wei. Even though Wei is unworthy, the King still treats him with respect, how much more so someone wiser than Wei? When the wise men of the world see that the King respects scholars in this way, they will surely come from a thousand miles away."</p>
<p>King Zhao listened to Guo Wei's words and built a palace for Guo Wei to live in, treating him with the respect due to a teacher. When the scholars of the world heard that King Zhao respected wise men, they all competed to come to Yan! Yue Yi came from the state of Wei, Zou Yan came from the state of Qi, Ju Xin came from the state of Zhao... King Zhao used their policies and spent twenty-eight years governing the state of Yan well. Then, he appointed Yue Yi as the supreme general and conspired with Qin, Chu, Han, Zhao, and Wei to attack Qi in place of them. The Qi army was defeated, and King Min of Qi fled to the city of Ju. The Yan army chased after them, breaking into Linzi, looting the treasures of Qi, and burning the rich mansions and ancestral temples of Qi. Of the seventy or so cities of Qi, only Ju and Jimo were not captured by the Yan army.</p>
<p>At that time, Jia's father had already been dead for more than ten years, and his son, Wang Sun Jia, was only fifteen years old. After Jia's father died, King Min of Qi had no one to warn him, and he gradually became dissolute and neglected to prepare for Yan, so he suffered a complete defeat. Jia's mother still hoped that he could recall Jia's father's policies, regain his spirit, and recover the lost territory. Therefore, she wanted to send her underage son to serve the troubled and powerless king.</p>
<p>She only had one son, Wang Sun Jia, whom she had given birth to when she was over forty years old, so she would naturally cherish him more than other mothers. If she did not love her country, how could she bear to send such a young son to take on such a dangerous and important task? She decided to send her son to take up the post that day, but her son did not yet know. He got up in the morning, still wearing his short hair, dressed in children's clothes with narrow sleeves and short legs. After greeting his mother good morning, he returned to his study to read. Jia's mother saw her son's thin back and couldn't help but shed tears like rain, silently thinking: "Useful people (referring to Jia's father) always die young, leaving behind such a small chicken that is not worth much, what can he do! He is also especially thinner and smaller than others. Relatives all say that I pressure him too much with his studies, ruining my son. If they knew that today I would have him put down his books and, in a lone city surrounded by enemies, risk his life to defend the country, I don't know what they would say about me. Alas! I can't worry about so much, surely I love my son just as much as anyone else? But none of them think as thoroughly as I do for him. Anyone with any spirit would rather die than be a slave to a fallen nation, much less my son? He is a tiger cub, he is a lion cub, he wants to leap out and devour his enemies. He can't be like a pig, huddled in a pen, allowing himself to be slaughtered..." Thinking of this, her courage was a hundred times greater, and she herself seemed to become young and strong again. She didn't even need her cane and walked briskly into the clothing room, took out Jia's father's court clothes, shortened them by a few inches, and barely managed to fit them on her son.</p>
<p>While Jia's mother was tying up her son's hair, she instructed him, "Son, the country has been bullied by the state of Yan to the point of being unrecognizable. Our land has almost been completely seized, and who knows how many people have been killed. If we don't unite and resist and recover our lost territory, we will become slaves to a fallen nation." Wang Sun Jia quickly said, "Mom, I can't be a slave to a fallen nation!" Jia's mother said, "Yes! You can't be a slave to a fallen nation, I can't be a slave to a fallen nation, and all the people of Qi can't be slaves to a fallen nation. That's why I want you to go out and save the country. The country is in urgent need of you and doesn't have time to wait for you to grow up." Wang Sun Jia said, "Mom, I've already grown up. Please don't always treat me like a child. Actually, what is the difference between adult and child? The one who can accomplish great things is an adult, otherwise, even if he is a hundred years old, I would say he is a child.—Mom, haven't you seen wolves and sheep? Wolves are smaller than sheep, but when sheep hear the sound of a wolf, they are so frightened that they can't move and allow themselves to be devoured by the wolf. How can we be arrogant because of our size and give up on ourselves because of our smallness?" When Jia's mother heard her son's words, she said happily, "If a child understands self-reliance, the state of Qi will not perish! The state of Qi will not perish!"</p>
<p>Wang Sun Jia went out to work, leaving early in the morning and returning late at night. Jia's mother, because she loved her son so much, would go out to the entrance of the alley to wait for her son as soon as she finished lunch. She would always stand for several hours every day before she saw her son return. Sometimes the news was bad, and she was worried about her son and couldn't put her mind at ease. Often, she would send her son out in the morning and, if he didn't come back, she would stand and wait all day. People nearby were used to it, and when they saw her silhouette in the distance, they knew it was her. One day, an old man named Wang, who was well-informed, saw that it was getting dark and Jia's mother was still standing at the entrance of the alley. He knew that her son had not yet returned and was very worried about her.</p>
<p>It turned out that a few days earlier, the state of Chu, resentful that the state of Yan had not divided the spoils fairly, had specially sent Nuo Chi to supervise a large army to Ju, ostensibly to save Qi, but in reality, to use force to force the state of Yan to divide the land and looted treasures of Qi equally with the state of Chu. King Min of Qi did not know of Nuo Chi's treacherous plot and opened the gates to let him into the city of Ju. In the first few days, he pretended to discuss plans for attack and defense with the King of Qi, but later he impolitely killed the King of Qi. When this news spread, some timid people of Qi, fearing that they could not stand their ground in Ju, fled to Jimo one after another. Wang Sun Jia, because he was unaware of the situation, still went to court on the day the King of Qi was killed. Old Man Wang, fearing that Jia's mother would worry, dared not tell her the truth, but only asked, "Old Madam, has Jia-ge'er not returned yet?"</p>
<p>"Old Man Wang, I don't know why Jia'er hasn't returned so late.—Is there any bad news?" Jia's mother asked.</p>
<p>Old Man Wang couldn't help but reveal a little news, saying, "I heard that Nuo Chi, sent by the state of Chu, is making things difficult for (he dared not say "killed") our king. Maybe there's something going on in the court, and Ge'er can't come back tonight. Old Madam, you should go home and rest."</p>
<p>Jia's mother thought that Old Man Wang's words made sense, thanked him, and slowly walked back. She had just arrived home when Wang Sun Jia also staggered back. Jia's mother quickly asked, "Where is the King of Qi?" Wang Sun Jia, fearing that his mother would be upset, dared not tell the truth, but stammered, "Um, you're asking about the King? Um—I don't know where the King went. I looked for him all day but couldn't find him, so I came back to see if you were worried." Jia's mother said angrily, "You useless child, what did you come back for?" She was so angry that she couldn't speak. After a while, she continued, "You serve the King, and the King has fled, but you don't know where the King is. How could you come back! I used to think you were a good child, knowing how to be loyal and righteous, so I especially loved you. You leave early in the morning and return late at night, and I would always go to the front door to wait for you. If you went out at night and didn't return, I would always go to the entrance of the alley to wait for you. Recently, because the country is in an emergency, I have been even more worried about you. No matter whether you left early or late, I would always stand at the entrance of the alley early to wait for you. If I had known you were so useless, why would I have put so much effort into you?"</p>
<p>When Wang Sun Jia heard his mother's words of blame, he quickly knelt down to explain, "How could I be so unfaithful and unrighteous? But the courtiers have all been bribed by Nuo Chi, and there is no one to discuss anything with..." Jia's mother interrupted her son before he could finish speaking and retorted, "You really don't understand! You still want to discuss saving the King and saving the country with the courtiers? If they were good people, the country wouldn't be in such a mess. I dare say that most of those in high positions today are like spies. There are very few reliable people. Why don't you go to the people to find truly patriotic and righteous people? The people of Qi are an excellent race, and there must be many people with spirit. If you can gather them, it won't be difficult to restore the state of Qi."</p>
<p>Wang Sun Jia bade farewell to his mother and immediately went into the city again. When he reached the city wall, the soldiers guarding the city refused to open the gate because it was dark. Fearing that he would anger his mother again, he dared not go home and stood under the city wall overnight. When the city gate opened at dawn, he ran to the market to call on the masses. He obtained permission from a butcher who slaughtered cattle to stand high on the meat stand and give a speech. He said loudly, "Everyone, uncles, aunts, brothers, and sisters, we people of Qi have been bullied by foreigners to the point where we can't bear it any longer..." When the crowd saw Wang Sun Jia, a small person wearing adult clothes, with a gauze hat covering his eyebrows, the collar touching the brim of his hat, revealing half of his small white face, just like dressing up a monkey, they couldn't help but laugh. But when they heard him talk about the country being humiliated, everyone became serious, stopped all buying and selling, and gathered around, listening attentively. Wang Sun Jia continued, "The country has more than seventy cities, all of which have been seized by the state of Yan, leaving only Ju and Jimo. We must rely on these two cities as a base to recover our lost territory. But now we are being controlled by Chu. Ever since Nuo Chi entered the city of Ju, Ju has not been part of Qi. Today, Nuo Chi killed our king. If we don't kill Nuo Chi, there is no hope for the restoration of Qi!" The crowd, holding back their tears, jumped up and said, "Kill Nuo Chi! Kill Nuo Chi!" Wang Sun Jia said, "Yes, I plan to go kill Nuo Chi. If any of you are willing to go with me, please take off your clothes and expose your right arm!"</p>
<p>So, more than four hundred people in the entire city, including Wang Sun Jia, exposed their right arms. Those with knives took knives, those with sticks took sticks, and they all went to Nuo Chi's camp to behead him and display his head to the public. The Chu soldiers were either killed, fled, or surrendered, and the city of Ju was restored in an instant. When the people of Qi near and far heard this news of victory, they all rubbed their fists and sharpened their palms, eager to try. Soon after, Tian Dan launched an uprising in Jimo in response, and quickly restored the entire state of Qi. This was all thanks to the ethnic revolution in the city of Ju, which inspired morale.</p>
<p>On the day of the successful revolution, after the great events were completed, the masses surrounded Wang Sun Jia and took him home to pay respects to his mother. Jia's mother stood at the entrance of the alley to welcome them. The crowd cheered thunderously, making Jia's mother so happy that she shed tears.</p>

<p>Standard Book of the Week, Published by Commercial Press</p>
<p>Robert Heinrich Lowie (1883—?) is a moderate scholar in contemporary "anthropology." Although his research area is limited to the Americas, he has collected a vast amount of materials and published numerous works. He analyzes things with a calm mind and a scientific perspective, not bound by past theories, and has made contributions and inventions. He does not regard civilized tribes as the chosen ones, thus looking down upon tribes with backward cultures in the same era. As a result, he published "Primitive Society" (1920) and "Are We Civilized?" (Ae We Civilizen, 1929). "Are We Civilized?" can help us understand that many of our current daily lives and customs come from primitive people, so we no longer dare to despise the culturally backward peoples of our time. Mr. Zhou Zuoren, a famous Chinese scholar, once said that this book is self-explanatory. What about "Primitive Society"? It is simply an excellent book, although it was published sixteen years ago, its value is still high. Especially for those engaged in "ethnology" and "anthropology," this book, which describes the truth and reality of early human society with a calm mind and fair perspective, enumerates the factors of the cultural history of early human society, and criticizes the inadequacy of the "evolutionary school" of thought, is a concise and lucid good book, and it is necessary to read it carefully.</p>
<p>Everyone knows the influence of the evolutionary school of thought in China in the past, and everyone knows the influence of L.H. Morgan's masterpiece "Ancient Society" in China, which was regarded as the ultimate truth. In fact, this is far from the truth. Morgan's book was published in 1877, when the study of "anthropology" and "ethnology" was not yet very enlightened. He took the evolutionary viewpoint as the premise, included all the complex situations of primitive society, regardless of black and white, and summarized them in a simple way, and then used this to discuss all early human cultures, seeking their slightest similarities, discarding most of the differences, fragmenting cultures, disregarding the whole picture, and forcibly mixing many early human cultures with different cultural histories and factors into one pile, and including them in the same type. How can this be considered appropriate?</p>
<p>We should know that "hypothesis" is not impossible, but all kinds of conditions must be met. "Arrangement" is also possible, but it cannot be based on accidental phenomena. "Culture" has a certain order and level in the excavated strata, which can be used to discover the construction process of early human culture. "Culture" is an organism, with many superficially similar phenomena, but they are not created by the same cause. Conversely, fixed cultural factors can produce one or more different phenomena. How can we insist on one and use it to exemplify the rest? Also, some cultures are accidentally the same, based on the similarity of primitive psychology; or only a small point of similarity. If we are unwilling to find its source calmly and rationally, regardless of its geographical environment, time, and space, and insist that it is completely the same because of a small point of similarity, and then think that it is the same type and discuss it, this is really arbitrary. Moreover, the different cultural processes are different due to their cultural backgrounds, and it is not necessarily the case that every century progresses to the same field; and it is not necessarily the case that they all follow the same path. It is impossible to assert that "matriarchal society" must precede "patriarchal society" based on accidental discoveries. Most things in the world are unpredictable, and it is a joke to unify the extremely complex early human society and early human culture with a simple model. The process of cultural development cannot be separated from the geographical environment. Because of this, its progress is slow or fast, and there are examples of squeezing without advancing or retreating. The different paths are not entirely due to one path, and there is no need to elaborate on them. How can one obtain great inventions that are in line with the actual situation by using the "evolutionary" perspective and methods?</p>
<p>Lowie carefully lists various systems, customs, and beliefs of early human society, extensively quoting and using lucid language to expose the shortcomings of Morgan's theory, which is convincing. He chapter by chapter examines Morgan's errors, based on facts, to restore them to their original appearance, without bias or arbitrariness, so that readers are stunned, not only feeling his vast knowledge, but also feeling his insightful views. He said: "Contemporary anthropologists have discovered many new knowledge and new methods, and Morgan's great work has become 'old fashioned'." After reading "Primitive Society" carefully, Lowie's words are indeed the truth, not boasting, nor a slander of the predecessors with deep self-expectation!</p>
<p>In this book, each chapter has countless examples, clearly and lucidly described, to prove the inadequacy of the "evolutionary school," to establish his own claim of explaining "culture" with "culture," and explaining the past cultural history and current cultural status with "cultural history" and "cultural environment," comprehensively and cautiously, with thoroughness and expertise, it can be said to be a book worth recommending.</p>
<p>Naturally, the first and last two chapters of this book are about "ethnology" and "anthropology" in general, but the discussions in these chapters are enough to show the author's claims, to refute the shortcomings of the "evolutionary theory" and "diffusion theory" of the "evolutionary school," for those who are new to this field, these two chapters are very important texts, and it is best to read them slowly and carefully. The chapters in the second half on social organization are detailed and meticulous, with rich materials and clear descriptions, which can be considered the most brilliant part of the book, and the author sincerely introduces it to all readers.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Introducing a Book on Chinese Rhetoric <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Yi</p>
<p>When it comes to Chinese literary critics, it seems that besides a few famous names such as Liu Xie and Zhong Rong, there are hardly any others, but this is because we have not studied carefully. In the wilderness, among the abandoned group, there are many great critics! What I want to introduce now is one of them.</p>
<p>First, let us know his background.</p>
<p>Chen Kui, a native of Linhai in the Southern Song Dynasty, styled Shujin, was the first in the imperial examination in Shaoxing. During the reign of Emperor Guangzong, he served as the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Personnel. During the reign of Emperor Ningzong, he served as the Assistant Administrator of the Privy Council concurrently. He served in high positions, but was later dismissed from office for offending Han Tuozhou. He wrote two books, "Southern Song Dynasty Court Records" and "Wen Ze," and "Wen Ze" is his major work on essays.</p>
<p>"Wen Ze" is a book that does not have a separate edition now, and is included in the Taizhou Series. The content of this book is mostly about the rhetoric of essays, and it is described in the most detail and completeness in chapters C and D.</p>
<p>Regarding rhetoric from the West, there is the so-called "metaphor." Chen Kui, in chapter C of this book, said that there are ten kinds of metaphors. I will now re-introduce a little.</p>
<p>First, is direct metaphor. He said: "First is direct metaphor, saying 'like', 'as if', 'as', or 'similar', which is clearly visible." And he gave examples of "climbing trees to catch fish," "rotten wood driving six horses," and "like the North Star, with all the stars revolving around it."</p>
<p>Second, is hidden metaphor. He said: "Second is hidden metaphor, although the text is hidden, the meaning can be found." And he gave examples of "Where can he flee to avoid it?" and "Is that Wu?" (Zuo Zhuan).</p>
<p>Third, is analogy. He said: "Third is analogy, taking one category to metaphorize it in order." And he gave the example of "The emperor is like a hall, the ministers are like steps, and the common people are like the ground" (Jia Yi's New Book).</p>
<p>Fourth, is rhetorical metaphor. He said: "Fourth is rhetorical metaphor, although it is a metaphor, it seems to be a difficult saying." This kind of question has the greatest power, and he gave the examples of "If tigers and rhinos escape from the cage and tortoises and jades are destroyed in the box, whose fault is it?" (Analects) "People have walls to avoid evil. If the cracks in the wall are broken, whose fault is it?" (Zuo Zhuan).</p>
<p>Fifth, is antithetical metaphor. He said: "Fifth is antithetical metaphor, first comparing and then correcting, the top and bottom are consistent." And he gave the examples of "Fish forget each other in the rivers and lakes, and people forget each other in the art of Tao" (Zhuangzi), "Rumors stop with the wise" (Xunzi).</p>
<p>Sixth, is broad metaphor. He said: "Sixth is broad metaphor, taking it as a metaphor, not one is enough." And he gave the examples of "If you are gold, use you as a whetstone; if you are crossing a great river, use you as a boat; if there is a great drought, use you as rain" (Book of Documents), "Like pointing to the side of the river, like cutting millet with a spear, like poking a gourd with a cone."</p>
<p>Seventh, is simple metaphor. He said: "Seventh is simple metaphor, although the text is brief, the meaning is very clear." And he gave the examples of "One name is the vehicle of virtue" (Zuo Zhuan), "Benevolence is the home" (Fa Yan).</p>
<p>Eighth, is detailed metaphor. He said: "Eighth is detailed metaphor, which requires many words before the meaning is clear." And he gave the example of "Those who lure cicadas must focus on brightening the fire and shaking the tree, but if the fire is not bright, it is useless even if the tree is shaken; now if the ruler of men can brighten his virtue, the world will return to him, just like the cicadas returning to the fire." (Xunzi).</p>
<p>Ninth, is quoted metaphor. He said: "Ninth is quoted metaphor, citing previous words to prove the matter." And he gave the examples of "As the proverb says, sheltering him and then looking for an axe" (Zuo Zhuan) "Moth larvae follow the path of time, is this what it means?" (Book of Rites).</p>
<p>Tenth, is virtual metaphor. He said: "Tenth is virtual metaphor, which does not refer to things or events." And he gave the examples of "His words seem insufficient" (Analects), "Now it seems that there is no place to stop" (Laozi).</p>
<p>Of the ten items listed above, the third, analogy, the sixth, broad metaphor, the eighth, detailed metaphor, and the tenth, virtual metaphor, these four are all variations of direct metaphor and cannot be successful as a separate category; and the fifth, antithetical metaphor, and the seventh, simple metaphor, are just changes in hidden metaphor and cannot be independent; these places cannot but be said to have the problem of repetition. As the General Outline of the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries says:</p>
<p>Dividing into categories is quite tedious and restrictive, and it is inevitable to abandon the big and seek the small. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e196">Masturbation - Nocturnal Emission <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Liu Zhimin</p>
<p>Young people are full of vitality. Sexual desire is most easily impulsive. Even a momentary lack of vigilance can lead to not only a loss of health, but also an impact on one's life, happiness, descendants, and lifespan. How can we not fear it?</p>
<p>Masturbation is the worst habit for young people to commit. Secret self-indulgence is common. It severely damages vitality and consumes essence. It often causes sexual diseases such as nocturnal emission, kidney atrophy, and premature ejaculation. It is unknown how many people's happiness has been sacrificed.</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Li, 32 years old, from Hunan Province, holds an important position in a yarn factory. Due to masturbation in his youth, his body could not develop properly and he suffered from insomnia and nocturnal emission. He tried every possible treatment, but none was effective. He consulted doctors and took medicine, but there was no improvement. His body gradually became thin, his eyes sunken, and his face pale. This spring, he was introduced by Mr. Lin Zuxian to my clinic for diagnosis and treatment. I instructed him to purchase "Hemitol's Sperm Strengthening Tablets" from Wuzhou Pharmacy to treat his nocturnal emission, and "Reproducton" to nourish and regulate his body. His vitality gradually became abundant, and his muscles gradually developed. For about five weeks, he never suffered from insomnia or nocturnal emission. All the symptoms disappeared, and he developed stronger than ever before. Recently, I received a letter from Mr. Li from Changsha, saying that since returning home, he has been strong and healthy, without any illness, and that his wife is several months pregnant.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Pathology and Treatment of Anemia <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Bofu</p>
<p>The source of this disease may be due to pulmonary tuberculosis, syphilis, malaria, typhoid fever, dysentery, surgery, or blood loss from external injuries, resulting in low blood count, pale blood, blood depletion, pale blood, sallow complexion, pale lips, listlessness, muscle wasting, loss of health, and various diseases. If not treated early, it will eventually lead to atrophy and death.</p>
<p>Patient Mr. He suffered from malignant anemia. He had been treated repeatedly, but there was no improvement. His body became thinner day by day, and symptoms of weakness appeared repeatedly. This spring, he was introduced by his cousin to my clinic for diagnosis and treatment. I prescribed "Reproducton," and his blood gradually became thicker. His complexion and lips turned ruddy. His vitality became abundant, his muscles developed, and his old ailments disappeared completely. He became stronger than ever.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Rheumatoid Bone Pain Causes Various Complications <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>Rheumatism is internal and its residual toxins enter the bones. It initially manifests as soreness and pain in the joints. If treatment is delayed, it will worsen into numbness in the limbs. If it becomes more severe, it can lead to hemiplegia or complete paralysis, loss of freedom of movement, and disability.</p>
<p>Last winter, a patient, Mr. Wei, came to complain of symptoms such as rheumatoid bone pain and numbness in his hands and feet. He had been treated repeatedly without effect. I diagnosed that Mr. Wei's condition was caused by residual toxins. I immediately instructed him to purchase "Strongton's Bone Pain Tablets" from Wuzhou Pharmacy to dispel wind and rheumatism and search for residual toxins. He immediately felt comfortable in his joints and his hands and feet became flexible. He took several boxes in a row and achieved a radical cure. He happily thanked me and left.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Pathology and Treatment of Leucorrhea <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Erchang, MD from the University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>
<p>Among venereal diseases, leucorrhea is the most stubborn and difficult to treat. The source of leucorrhea is a type of gonococcus (or cocci), which is contracted from unclean sexual intercourse. It first wreaks havoc in the anterior urethra, causing swelling and pain. Then it enters the posterior urethra and internal tissues, using the mucosa as a protective membrane, forming various dangerous conditions. It not only leads to infertility and extinction, but also harms the body and shortens life.</p>
<p>The treatment for this disease focuses on killing bacteria. Yellow pigment is the most effective bactericidal agent. However, yellow pigment injections often have the drawbacks of pigment deposition in the skin and causing inflammation. Recently, with the development of science and medicine, and after repeated research and improvement, the discovery of oral yellow pigment preparations has emerged. After use, it has the same effect as injected yellow pigment, without the drawbacks of various side effects.</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Bu, 32 years old, contracted gonorrhea in his early years due to involvement with prostitutes. He repeatedly took various cheap medicines sold on the market, which were not only ineffective but also missed the opportunity for easy treatment, turning it into a stubborn chronic condition, tormenting him and causing him great suffering. This spring, he was introduced by his fellow villager Mr. Fang to my clinic. For economic reasons, I instructed him to purchase the yellow pigment preparation "Antilin" from Taihe Pharmacy for self-treatment. Fortunately, the medicine directly reached the affected area and penetrated the mucosa. After taking several boxes in a row, the inflammation and swelling subsided, the bacteria were killed, and the discharge cleared. His vitality was restored, and he celebrated his rebirth.</p>

<p>— Physician Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Women Quitting Smoking</p>
<p>In late spring, Ms. Hu Zhou came to the clinic, complaining of irregular menstruation and leucorrhea, and the discomfort of quitting smoking. I instructed her to purchase "Female Reproducton" from Wing On Company to regulate her menstruation and remove the toxins from smoking. She used "Leucorrhea Treatment Elixir" externally to treat her leucorrhea. Because Ms. Hu wanted to shorten the time to quit smoking, I also injected "Youth Vitality Life-Saving" to assist her. Within a month, she successfully quit smoking safely.</p>
<p>Quitting Smoking with Stomach Pain</p>
<p>Last month, Mr. Tang, a patient with chronic stomach pain, came to the clinic seeking to quit smoking. I instructed him to purchase "Stomach Strengthening Elixir" and "Stomach Pain Relief Elixir" from Wing On Company to treat his stomach pain with both treatment and nourishment, and to use "Reproducton" to quit smoking safely. His stomach pain was relieved and his smoking addiction was broken.</p>

<p>Mr. Li from Min Ti Ni Yin Road said, "My wife, Ms. Lin, comes from a famous family and has always been delicate. Since marrying me, we have been in love. Three years after marriage, we had a son, which increased our love even more. However, my wife suffered from kidney deficiency, back pain, weakness, and illness due to postpartum imbalance. The most painful thing was irregular menstruation and persistent leucorrhea, which could not be treated. Later, a relative, Mr. Zhang, introduced her to Dr. Zhan Nianzeng for diagnosis and treatment. He prescribed 'Leucorrhea Treatment Elixir' for external use and 'Female Reproducton' for internal use. Her ailments disappeared. Her body quickly became stronger, her back was stronger, and her vitality was abundant. Because I remember that my wife was able to regain her health and beauty, it was all thanks to Dr. Zhan and the good medicine. I am deeply grateful and write these few words to express my gratitude and recommend him."</p>
<h3 id="e202">A Case of a Patient with Nocturnal Emission Quitting Smoking <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhu from Zhifu Road said, "I have been enslaved by smoking addiction for almost twenty years. During these twenty years, I have been listed on the blacklist, and my spirit, body, reputation, and career have all been affected. In addition, smoking is inconvenient, and I have repeatedly tried various methods of quitting, but all have failed due to the emergence of various illnesses, mental depression, and difficulty in supporting my physical strength. The most painful thing is frequent nocturnal emission and confusing dreams, making me wonder if I am still in the human world. Pessimism attacked me, and I suffered from neurasthenia. My heart was full of resentment, which can be imagined. Last month, I was fortunate enough to be introduced by my close friend Mr. Qian to Dr. Wang Shiying for diagnosis and treatment. He recommended taking 'Reproducton' to relieve weakness and break the addiction, and 'Hemitol's Sperm Strengthening Tablets' to treat my nocturnal emission. I immediately purchased them from the China-England Pharmacy. After taking them, the nocturnal emission was cured, all the illnesses were gone, the toxins from smoking were removed, and the smoking addiction was broken. I am able to regain my freedom and happiness today, shouldn't I attribute it to the famous doctor and famous medicine?"</p>

<p>Underdevelopment</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu from Zhengzhou - Masturbation must be stopped. For nocturnal emission, take "Hemitol's Sperm Strengthening Tablets." If you want to regain development, you can take "Reproducton." Then your body will be strong and healthy, and your spirit will be refreshed. As for stomach pain, you can take "Stomach Pain Relief Elixir."</p>
<p>Leucorrhea and Bone Pain</p>
<p>Mr. Ke from Tiantong Road - "Antilin" is most effective for treating leucorrhea. Taihe Pharmacy, China-Western Pharmacy, and Wing On Company all sell it. For soreness and pain in the joints, "Strongton's Bone Pain Tablets" are the most effective. Because your illness is caused by gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Premature Aging</p>
<p>Mr. Gu - Your relative's premature aging is one of the symptoms of neurasthenia. You should take "Reproducton" to treat it. It can restore youth. However, women should take "Female Reproducton."</p>
<p>Quick Effect to Quit Smoking</p>
<p>Mr. Wu from Chengdu Road - Since "Reproducton" has been effective, you can continue to take it with peace of mind. If you want a quick effect, you can also inject "Youth Vitality Life-Saving" at the same time to assist it. As for stomach problems, you can treat them with "Stomach Pain Relief Elixir" and "Stomach Strengthening Elixir."</p>
<p>Nocturnal Emission and Insomnia</p>
<p>Mr. Luo - "Hemitol's Sperm Strengthening Tablets" come in a new iron box. You can specify and purchase them from famous pharmacies. Imitations have been found in paper boxes and bottles. Do not purchase them by mistake. It is even more effective to take "Reproducton" at the same time.</p>
<p>Reproductive Gland Preparation "Reproducton" is divided into male and female versions. The best sperm strengthening medicine is "Hemitol's Sperm Strengthening Tablets." They are sold in major pharmacies. Please be sure to specify when purchasing. Do not purchase cheap and inferior medicines by mistake to avoid missing the opportunity to treat the disease.</p>

<p>(1) Husband and Wife Treated for Hidden Illnesses, A Son is Born the Following Year</p>
<p>Patient Huang Renjie, from Wuxian. Before marriage, Mr. Huang frequented places of entertainment due to social gatherings, exhausting his mind and body day and night. His sexual function was severely damaged, resulting in symptoms of rapid and weak sexual performance. Last spring, I performed electrotherapy and instructed him to purchase and take reproductive gland preparations, which cured him suddenly. The following month, Mr. Huang and his wife came together, seeking treatment for his wife's amenorrhea and persistent leucorrhea. I instructed her to take female reproductive gland preparations internally and purchase Leucorrhea Treatment Elixir for external use. She followed the instructions and treated herself at home. Within about three or four days, a lot of leucorrhea was discharged. From the fifth day, the leucorrhea gradually cleared. Before long, her menstruation also returned and was very normal. The couple both regained their health. A month ago, Mr. Huang sent a letter of thanks, saying that his wife had given birth to a son. They had been married for many years without children. Now they have been blessed with a son, thanks to the rich experience of your esteemed doctor and the correct medicine.</p>
<p>(2) Masturbation Depletes, Regaining Development</p>
<p>Patient Li Junwei, 25 years old, from Jiangning. A student. In his early years, Mr. Li was induced by bad friends and mistakenly committed the bad habit of masturbation. He damaged his body and depleted his essence. Later, due to the loss of his body and the emergence of symptoms of weakness, he realized the harm and quit. However, because the reproductive glands had become atrophied, he suffered from nocturnal emission. At first, it was several times a month, and then several times every ten days. He sought medical treatment and took medicine, but the effect was lacking. He suffered from insomnia and forgetfulness. It was not until last winter that he came to my clinic for diagnosis and treatment. I used the latest scientific surgical electrotherapy and instructed him to purchase reproductive gland preparations and sperm strengthening medicines and take them together. Within a month, the nocturnal emission was cured early. His body quickly became strong and healthy, his muscles were full, his weight increased, his spirit was refreshed, and he regained his youth. It is said that the development was perfect, which he had never experienced before.</p>
<p>(Note) Dr. Zhan's clinic is open from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Closed on Sundays.</p>

<p>Gonorrhea Untreated Causes Various Dangerous Conditions</p>
<p>Gonorrhea initially wreaks havoc in the genital area. Then it penetrates deep into the internal tissues, causing various dangerous conditions. The harm is severe. In minor cases, it harms the body and loses health. In severe cases, it leads to infertility and shortens life. This spring, Mr. Bi came to complain that his gonorrhea had been delayed and untreated and had turned into a chronic condition. Not only did he have frequent and painful urination, but he also had orchitis and arthritis. He suffered unspeakable pain. I instructed him to purchase and take Antilin and effective bone pain tablets. After taking them, the toxins were removed, the discharge cleared, the inflammation subsided, and the pain stopped. He recovered quickly and has not relapsed since. He said that if he had not mistakenly taken cheap and inferior medicines in the past and had taken famous medicines earlier, he could have avoided a lot of pain.</p>
<p>Quitting Smoking Uncomfortable and Painful</p>
<p>Nourishment is the best method for quitting smoking. Nourishing agents should not be abandoned during treatment. During cessation, the physiological and psychological states suddenly change. The spirit is depressed and illnesses emerge. It is not enough to only focus on treatment and nourishment to achieve safe smoking cessation. Last month, Mr. and Mrs. Xiao came together seeking to quit. They complained of repeated attempts and failures, insomnia, and discomfort. I immediately instructed them to purchase male and female reproductive gland preparations separately. Because they have both nourishing and therapeutic effects, they felt happy and disgusted with smoking after taking them. Because Mr. Xiao wanted a quick effect, I also injected him with a special Youth Vitality Life-Saving. Because this product has the function of assisting reproductive gland preparations, removing toxins, and breaking addiction, internal use and injection were completed in less than a month. The Xiaos praised reproductive gland preparations as a blessing for quitting smoking.</p>
<p>Antilin has amazing effects. Bone pain tablets must specify those with the words "Strongton." Reproductive gland preparations "Reproducton" are divided into male and female versions. The special Youth Vitality Life-Saving is named "Youth Vitality Life-Saving." (The above medicines are sold in Wing On Company, China-Western Pharmacy, and major pharmacies)</p>

<h3 id="e205">Hankou Relief Society Expands its Organization <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Jiu</p>
<p>The Hankou Municipal Government, considering the relief efforts in the city, although there are existing organizations such as the Relief Committee and the Poor People's Loan Office to handle them, believes that relief work, according to regulations, is not limited to one aspect. Matters such as caring for the elderly and weak, temporary repatriation, and organizing winter relief are all crucial. Omissions in the arrangements would be contrary to the government's principle of treating everyone equally. Therefore, to comprehensively plan and consider all aspects, aiming to universally benefit the poor, it has been decided to expand the organization of the existing Hankou Relief Committee. The committee will establish six departments for women, beggars, the disabled, orphans, infant care, and loans. Other relief efforts will also be handled by the committee, streamlining authority and particularly focusing on providing loans to the poor to help them find their own livelihoods, thereby stabilizing the city.</p>
<p>Originally, as the saying goes, "Help in emergencies, not in poverty." Helping the poor is indeed a very difficult task, especially now that our great country has suffered repeated enemy invasions, and rural bankruptcy seems to have made no progress under the slogan of "reviving the countryside." The expansion of the Hankou Municipal Government's Relief Committee is not without a traceable root cause.</p>
<p>On the surface, the expanded organization of the Hankou Relief Society seems to be a very welcome thing for the universal benefit of the poor. All those with a compassionate heart bless the poor, believing that the number of poor people can be reduced and society can be stabilized. Perhaps "living in peace and working happily" and "economic prosperity" can be achieved. However, according to actual observations, the expanded organization of the Hankou Relief Society precisely reveals the hidden worries of unrest in Hankou. Because no matter how much the organization of the Relief Society expands, the mass production of the poor may make the expanded organization of the Relief Society become a not-so-large organization.</p>
<p>We see the increasing number of beggars on the streets every day. Examining their origins, some have fled famine from disaster-stricken rural areas, while others have become unemployed and have no means of making a living. Others, such as women (prostitutes), the disabled, orphans, abandoned infants, etc., are all products of social and economic bankruptcy. Therefore, while the expansion of the "Relief Society" is necessary, it is even more "necessary" to ensure that slogans such as "prospering the market" and "reviving the countryside" are thoroughly and resolutely implemented!</p>
<p>As for loans to the poor, we have also organized them in Shanghai in the past, but the conditions were harsh, such as requiring a guarantor from a shop. May I ask, which shop trusts the poor? Therefore, loans to the poor only make the poor feel "overwhelmed with difficulties"! This point is deeply hoped that the philanthropists who organize loans to the poor will pay attention to.</p>
<h3 id="e206">On the Balcony <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Changfeng</p>
<p>I was awakened in the morning by a knocking sound. The weather was getting hot again, and I thought it would be good to get up early, so I slipped on my slippers and went to the balcony to wash up. However, upon opening the door, there were piles of wood and lead sheets in front of me. Two carpenters were working on the balcony, and the second landlord was standing high on the steps leading to the balcony, seemingly directing everything. When he saw me come out, he greeted me with a smile and told me that he was going to build a loft on the balcony to store some old things. Almost all of Shanghai's second landlords rely on renting out a shikumen building to make a living, and it is common to build lofts on the balcony. I casually responded, "Very good! Very good!" Although building a loft would at least reduce many conveniences for us tenants on the third floor with three rooms, the common living room when I moved in has now been turned into their bedroom, so the tenants on the third floor naturally have no reason to object to building a loft on the balcony.</p>
<p>When I came back in the evening, the two carpenters had just finished cleaning up. A loft with a lead sheet roof had been built, and it just covered the light behind my bedroom. I stepped onto the steps to take a look. The balcony still had a corner with a water tap. I don't have a wife, and my clothes are all sent to the laundry, so it is still convenient for me to have a water tap.</p>

<p>It seemed to be about a week later. When I went to the balcony to wash up in the morning, I found that a family was living in the loft, a couple and a child. The man greeted me very politely and asked if I lived on the third floor, and was afraid that the child's noise had startled me. The man spoke very gently, as if he was very sorry. I told him that I usually got up very early, and put a basin of cold water and went back to the room. When I went downstairs that day, the second landlord deliberately stopped me and declared:</p>
<p>"A family has moved onto the balcony. They were introduced by a friend. Because all the rooms are full, I rented the balcony to them. My things are still piled at the foot of the stairs!"</p>
<p>As he spoke, he pointed to a pile of broken things under the stairs, as if he didn't mean to lend the lead sheet loft on the balcony to others, but that he had lent it out because he couldn't refuse the friend's request. He walked out.</p>
<p>A few days later, I gradually became familiar with the family on the balcony. The couple were both very good people. They were afraid that it would be inconvenient for me to fetch water, so they often filled the lead bucket outside my door with water for me. The man asked the second landlord several times if I disliked them, and sometimes came to my room to chat.</p>
<p>They both worked in a cigarette factory nearby. The woman worked the day shift, and the man worked the night shift, but sometimes when the two of them couldn't switch shifts, they would lock the child in the room. Once, he gave me many cigarettes, which he brought back from the factory. He said that he didn't smoke himself, and they would just get moldy if he left them. It is said that there is a rule in the cigarette factory that each employee is given a certain number of cigarettes every month. Those workers sell them to cigarette shops at a low price to earn some extra income. So I knew that "they would just get moldy if I left them" was his excuse. I was willing to sell those cigarettes to me at the market price, but he refused to take my money. And the cigarettes for the second month were given to me again. Since I couldn't refuse, I bought some candy and gave it to their child as a token of appreciation. He thanked me a thousand times.</p>
<p>The second landlord was originally afraid that I would not be used to living with those lower-class people and would want to move out. Now that he knew that we got along very well, he often came up to the third floor to join in. He said that I was a good tenant, and that the couple were also very good people, and that people who went out needed help from others, like a meddling matchmaker.</p>
<p>The second joint photography exhibition of Lu Shi Fu and Chen Chuanlin opened on the 20th on the fourth floor of the Da... Company. The one on the left is by Mr. Chen....</p>
<p>...The woman who worked the day shift had not returned, and the man, as usual, locked the door and went to work the night shift. He met me at the door and happily told me: "The factory is going to produce a batch of orders, and his mother has gone to work the day and night shifts. The extra pay for adding a shift is doubled, but unfortunately, there are not many times when shifts are added." He jumped downstairs like a child.</p>
<p>That night, I was awakened by a loud noise, and at the same time, someone was knocking on my door. It was the second landlord's voice. I put on my clothes and came out. A burst of heat scorched me. There were many people on the balcony knocking on the lead sheet. It turned out that the loft had caught fire. Because it was a lead sheet roof, the fire could not come out. The neighbors on the opposite building saw the fire in the small window and shouted. But many people were crowded in the corner of the balcony and there was no way to demolish the house, and there was no way to put out the fire. When the fire truck came and used an axe to open the loft, there was nothing left inside.</p>
<p>I looked at the scorched and smelly pile of fire, thinking of that lively child, that couple who were working the night shift in the factory! That kind couple. I leaned against my door as if I had lost consciousness until the smoke completely subsided before I felt a slight chill. The sky was about to dawn.</p>

<p>Night of the First Snow</p>
<p>On a snowy night in early winter, the master, young mistress, etc., are happily enjoying themselves under the warm light; but outside their window, a scene of the reality of the masses is also unfolding——</p>
<p>The situation is extremely tense and terrifying. Sandbags are piled high on the streets, and soldiers are wearing leather shoes and carrying guns, ready to sacrifice themselves to defend the nation and the truth. At this time, the unemployed poor and hawkers have to stand in the corner of the wall against the wind for the sake of life, sighing and resenting deeply.</p>
<p>He Laosan is an unemployed worker who has been running around for a day and borrowed two yuan; he is now standing on the street corner, waiting for another friend who is willing to lend him money. On one side, he is worried about his hungry wife and children at home. Standing beside him is the wandering Mr. Yu, a man of letters with nowhere to go. So the two of them talked and exchanged the sincere sympathy of the oppressed.</p>
<p>The street corner is really a public school full of life knowledge; the wonton seller tells of the suffering he has suffered from the economic panic; the thief tells of his way of life…………</p>
<p>A poor girl in distress, because the Northeast has become a lost country, and the enemy has taken away their peace, so she wandered to the coast of the Yangtze River with her old father, begging for food. However, everyone in the city is also shouting that they cannot live, chewing on the lodging expenses of poverty, and the inn waiter has detained his old father.</p>
<p>The poor girl pleads bitterly with the banker, but all she gets is ruthless disgust. The poor girl is overwhelmed by hunger and cold and faints on the ground. He Laosan couldn't stand it and instinctively used the one yuan he borrowed to pay off the poor girl's debt. But He Laosan lost the money to buy wontons. Finally, he got the sympathy of the wonton seller, who gave He Laosan and Mr. Yu wontons for free.</p>
<p>At that time, street singers wandered to this street corner. Among them, street singer A is a master of singing Qilin-style Peking Opera: street singer B is a frustrated vocalist. Because ladies and gentlemen do not understand art, he has no food to eat and is reduced to being an assistant to street singer A. Street singer B was discovered by Mr. Yu to be an old friend from many years ago, so everyone exchanged sighs.</p>
<p>He Laosan finally couldn't wait for his friend, but his wife rushed over anxiously, complaining about the suffering of not having money to pay the rent and the children having nothing to eat. She wanted to drag him home, because the enemy was about to carry out their beastly massacre.</p>
<p>But they didn't expect the enemy to rush over violently immediately. Even the masters and young mistresses did not expect it, and they were still dancing and singing amorous songs madly.</p>
<p>Finally, in order to survive and not to be inhuman slaves of a lost country, the masses united with the soldiers and fought bravely for the truth.</p>

<p>Light clouds and drizzle, spring is brewing thick. Throw away idle worries and go to Emerald Pavilion. The eyes are full of fragrant flowers and birds are silent. Suddenly, a pair of butterflies chase after the fragrance. Fluttering like a flower ball. Up and down like birds entering the forest. He is, the wind occasionally carries swallows. When playing in the water, he wants to learn from dragonflies. Baochai is, carrying a silk fan and tapping lightly. But seeing, the sleeves are slightly fragrant and the sweat is dripping. Passing through the nine bends of the painting gallery. Parting flowers and willows are more careful. Just when, wanting to catch but suddenly inaccessible. Suddenly hearing, whispered words are heard across the water. Baochai is, always able to cheat with alertness. Walking across Qinfang Bridge, he hesitates. Loudly calling Pin'er on purpose. He is, shifting the blame to Jiangdong for fear of killing himself. Suddenly hearing the window blessing open. He then raised his voice and slowly stepped towards the water's edge. Xiaohong was very anxious when he heard it. From now on, he will plant a source of trouble to Xiaoxiang. It is a loss for him to put in a lot of effort.</p>
