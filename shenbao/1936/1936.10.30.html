<h3>最近中國財政之分析（上）</h3>
<p>— 孫懷仁</p>
<p>去年十一月四日幣制實施改革以後、接着當局便發了一個宣言，說新幣制實施十八個月以後，中國財政收支便可平衡。這個實言的頒發，顯然就是說明着新幣制實施與中央財政是有着不可分的聯繫。因此一般留心財政問題的人，自後不僅要注意到財政事態本身的變動，同時又必須深深的注意到新幣制之動態了。在這裏，我們假若把那當局的宣言，作爲一個邏輯的大前提，那末，新幣制不實施，當然中國財政在十八個月以後不能平衡，或者實施而失敗，中國財政在十八個月以後也小能平衡。這推論是否是錯誤，那就要看大前提是否是錯誤，在另一方面，新幣制與中國中央財政，旣有如是密切之關係，當然財政本身事態之如何，也足以影響新幣制的效果的。</p>
<p>於是，人們對於中國經濟前途的觀察，也便發生了兩大相反的心理。第一種人是把新幣制評價得很高的，認爲新幣制實施以後，中國的貿易，中國的購買力，中國經濟的一切，都會大趨繁榮，財政收支自然也會平衡了，這一類人，可以給它一個名詞，稱爲「新幣制之樂觀派。」第二種人却相反的重視於中國財政的不健全性，認爲在不改善目前的財政本質以前，收支是無法平衡的，而新幣制之所能使財政平衡者，只在於通貨膨脹可能的一點上，因此這一派人是「新幣制之悲觀派。」對於新幣制樂觀的顯然也就是對於中國財政抱樂觀的；同樣，對於新幣制悲觀的，當然也就是對於中國財政的悲觀論者。</p>
<p>從幣制改革到今日，差不多將近十二個月了，距離宣言中十八個月的約期，只有半個年頭了。在那過去的三分之二的約期中，雖不曾看到表面上的通貨膨脹，但也不曾看到中央財政顯然的轉好。九月六日孔財長對新聞記者曾經談過最近中央財政的情形，據說去年度財政不敷達二萬萬元，幸本開源節流之原則？竭力維持，並整理稅收，節省各項經費，而得安渡難關。本年度以兩廣統一，國家信用更臻鞏固，又以農產豐收，走私勢戢，金融安定，加之所得稅開始徵收，中央財政，稍假時日，定能趨於平衡。（見九月七日時事新報）在這個談話中明白的透露出了中央財政前途，似乎大有可爲，於是一般樂觀論者，更感到它們的理論是有事實的表現了。不過，前面那些財政好轉的報告，倒底還不過是一種口頭的傳備，因此，中國財政是好轉乎？抑惡化乎？尚不能不有待於今後六個月約期中的事實來說明。但人類間的一切，是受着因果法則所支配的，未來的事實如何，雖不能像預言家那樣下一個肯定的斷言然而多少也可以由過去的因，推想出一些來，推想錯諛不錯誤，那就靠未來的事實來對照。</p>
<p>在這裏，就開始推論中國財政之前途，檢討那兩種對中國財政不同的理論。</p>
<p>說到近幾年來中國財政上最明顯的危機，無論誰都會指出那收支不能平衡的一個現象來罷。據政府的公表數字·從民國十七年度以降·每年歲入不足的數字·常在一萬萬元左右。有决算的幾年中（從十七——三年度，）以二十二年度的一萬四千七百萬元爲最大不足額，不足之數，的占支出額的一九·二％，其後的二十三，二十四兩年度，雖尚無正式的决算數字，但不足也依然在一萬萬元以上。這種財政上收支的不能平衡，雖然是一種近代帶有世界性的流行病態，似乎無足稱奇，但對於中國這樣貧弱的國民經濟而言，其嚴重性當不能與他國同日而語。過去十年來年年一萬萬元以上的短絀額，差不多完全以公債政策彌補了過去。這種公債政策，到今年二月的强制掉換統一公債時，已覺得牠前途的希望已少，（按自二十四年七月以後，每月內債償還之基金，卽已不足四百萬元。）退一步言，　令公債政策在今日之中國。尚有消化力量，但那樣年復一年的不平衡下去，積重難返，也總有一日是要碰壁的。因此，在目前而言調整中國財政，誰都會覺得是應該先由平衡收支入手，所以去年幣制改革的當時，也就提出了十八個月後收支得以平衡的的言，而使大家能對幣制改革發生濃厚的同情。</p>
<p>幣制改革十八個月以後，中國財政是否眞能收支平衡，這我在前面已經說過，現在還很難講，但就眼前橫置着的財政狀况看來，這的言的實踐，决不是一件怎樣容易的事。廿四年度現在已過去了，我們暫時不去管牠，卽就七月一日開始的二十五年度財政預算來研究，我們却發見了牠小但收支不能平衡，甚至其不平衡的數字，已出現了新的最高記錄。二十五年度歲出入經臨合計，各爲九萬九千〇七十萬元，（這是中國有預算以來的最高數額）在表面上雖然保持着了平衡，但實則我們把歲入的內容來仔細檢查一下，就知道這裏面有二萬萬元以上是借欵與虛列的收人。我們把最近二年來預算中租稅外的收入，可列如决表。（單位千元）</p>
<p>從這個表裏，可以看出歷年來我國財政上租稅外收入是在如何突飛猛進了，但這數字却是不可信的。最容易看出來的，就是國有營業純益一項，在極短的一二年中，居然已由八百萬元增爲四千萬元以上了，一五倍以上，）這是含有若干誇大性的。（詳見後）此外，像國有財產收入及雜項收支的兩項，二十四年度數字雖較二十三年度增加，而二十五年度却已較二十四年度减少了，這正是表示出了過去虛列得太多，而如今不能不减少些了。在大體上看，二十五年度各項租稅外的收入，都比上年度减少些，但總數却比上年度增加了四千萬元這就因爲借欵收入一項多了五千五百萬元之故。據某種的統計，去年度中央財政的不足數達一萬七千萬元，那末，我們可以推想出二十五年度的不足數當在二萬二千萬元以上。（據立法委員陳長蘅氏報告，不足爲二萬萬元左右。）在眼巴巴望着六個月後（滿十八個月）財政收支可以平衡的人們看見了這樣一個歷來未見的大不足額，也許會覺着嗒然的吧。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>美國總統競選之意義</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>美國之大總統選舉。將於下月四日舉。行數日以來。競選運動已達白熟狀態。共和民主兩大黨。勢均力敵。鹿死誰手。端賴於此數日宣傳之效果如何。據路透社所。傳羅斯福已在三十二州獲得優勢。可得百分之七十選畢票。而蘭登（共和黨之候選總統）於十六州稍佔勝利。可得百分之三十選舉票。但據紐的文藝裙華週刋之測騐。結果適為相反蘭登可獲三十二州之優勢。而羅斯福有勝利希望者。僅十六州。投票力之比。為三百七十對一百六十一。差數甚大。蓋本屆選舉。選民處於猶豫間者。頗為衆多。紐的等較大州份。允為舉棋莫定。然如無特殊之變化。羅斯福之獲勝希望似較蘭登為大也。</p>
<p>此次競選。意義頗為重大。孰勝孰敗。其影響所及。不限於羅斯福或蘭登之個人得失。也就美國國家經濟之前途言之。羅斯福主張改良。由國家控制全國之經濟活動。使資本主義不致陷於無政府狀態而自趨死亡。蘭登主張保守。欲恢復一九三三年以前之狀態。主張個人主義與自由競爭。以國家干涉私人之經濟活動。為獨裁及專制之濫觴。更欲平衡預算。减少賑卹之費。故蘭登如果獲勝。美國將返於舊日之經濟上無政府狀態。勞工貧農及失業者負價者必感苦痛。此其一。就美國之政治前途而言。羅斯福主張集權。對於憲法上賦予聯邦政府之權主張擴大。以符時代之要求。如有困難不惜修改憲法。及减少最高法院之權。蘭登則主張保障人民之自由及各州之權力。視憲法與最高法院。為神聖不可侵犯。使彼獲勝。則美國之政治機構。將不足以應付當前之社會經濟要求此其二。</p>
<p>就外交方面言之。兩氏雖各主張國際孤立政策。並盛倡維持和平之說。然態度頗有分別。羅斯福謂軍火商人等為戰爭之作崇者。圖中立必先防國際銀行家國際軍火商之圖利。又深感經濟壁壘之增加。為國家問惡感之原因。圖和平必從事於商訂互惠關稅條約。以經濟互助求國際善戚。故羅斯福之態度。為自責的。為建設的。蘭登則不然。彼竭力反對國際聯盟及世界法庭。主張擴大海陸空軍。避免與他國合作。取消互惠關稅協定。且欲收回戰債促他國之裁軍。其態度為責人的。消極的在羅期福執政之日。國聯及愛好和平國家尙有與華盛頓携手之可能。使蘭登當選則狹義之國家主義。支配華盛頓之外交政策。國際合作之希望。更為渺茫矣。</p>
<p>今歐洲及遠東方面。戰爭之恐怖。已到頂點。而人類文明之毀滅。能否延期至一九三六年以後。頗成問題西班牙之戰禍。已使蘇俄與德意處於敵國狀况之下。而日本對華之積極行動。使遠東和平有一髮千鈞之危。美國為世界之最大和平勢力。而其國運與世界任何一隅之和平。脈脈相關近者中美之太平洋航空直接通航。彼邦報業領袖何懷德先生亦乘風東來。可見遠東與美國關係日趨密切。吾人對於美國元首之更迭。應切實注意而被邦人士對於中國及世界各國之內外關係。更宜激底明瞭。空談孤立忌言合作。恐非計之所得。在美國總選之前夜。吾人願彼邦國民有切實之考慮也。</p>

<p>師範學校寫嚴格訓練靑年身心、養成小　健全師資之塲所、共所養成鄉村小學師資爲主旨之師範學校則稱爲鄉村師範學校、此外、尙有幼稚師範科、特別師範科、簡易師範學校及簡易鄉村師範學校四種、師範學校成鄉村師範學校修必年限二年、招收初級中學畢業生、幼稚師範科附設於師範學校、爲養成幼稚園的健全師資之塲所、修業年限二年或三年、招收初中畢業生、特別師範科附設師範學校或公立中學、修業年限一年、招收髙級中學或髙級職業學校畢業生、簡易師範學校則爲造就義務敎育師資而設、招收初中畢業生的修業年限一年、招收小學畢業生的、修業年限四年、以養年鄕村義務敎育師資爲主、則稱簡易鄕村師範學校、修業年限四年、招收小學畢業生、據敎育部二十二年的統計全國共有師範學校八百九十三校、內師範學校一百五十一校、鄉村師範學校九十四校、簡易師範學校三百八十九校、簡易鄕村師範學校二百五十九校、此外山中學及職業學校附設之師範科二百零八校、（內有普通師範科一百十五校鄉　師範科三十一校、簡易師範科一百零五校、簡易鄉村師範科五十七校、）全國師範學生數爲十萬零零八百四十人、每一萬人口中有師範生二人、師範生與小學生數量上之比的爲一與一百二十之比、師範生實在太少了、爲謀普及敎育計、應該多多的增設師範學校廣招師範生，以養成身心健全的師資、</p>
<p>師範學校為造就小學師資之所、對於小學敎育、頗關重要、所以規定由省政府或行政院直轄市政府設立、亦有以地方需要、得由縣政府市政府或兩縣以上聯合設立、除幼稚師範科及養成小學的工藝·圖書·音樂·家事·及體育師資的師範學校外、私人一概不得設立帥範學校、其設立地點、應視地方情形、分設於城市或鄉村、應於可能範圍內、多設立於鄕村間、簡易師範學校、以縣市設立爲原則、允應於可能範圍內設立鄕村地方、因爲我國鄉村很多、而已經設立的小學、多偏在城市中、故應提倡多多設立鄉村小學、因而所需要的鄉村小學師資甚多、所以不得不早爲準備、多設鄕村師範學校、以養成鄉村小學師資、與農業推廣、農村自治經濟建設及地方衛生的工作人員、</p>
<p>又爲求小學師資能平均分佈於各地起見、各省敎育行政機關得依各該省情形、劃分全省爲若干師範區、每一師範區內得設師範學校及女子師範學校各一所、從事培植各該區健全小學敎師、</p>
<p>師範學校除私立者外、一概免徵學費、亦有免除膳宿費一部或全部者、畢業後槪應服務敎育界、在規定期限內、不得升學或改就他業、否則就要追繳學膳等費了。</p>
<p>職業學校、爲培養靑年生活之知識與生產之技能的塲所、分爲初級職業學校與髙級職業學校、其合設初髙級者稱職業學校、初級職業學校招收小學畢業生或具有相當程度年在十二足歲至十八歲者、修業年限一年至三年、遇必要的時候得酌量縮短、髙級職業學校招收初中畢業或具有相當程度年在十五足歲至二十二歲者、修業年限除法令別有規定者外、均爲三年、其招收小學畢業或具有相當程度年在十一足歲至二十歲者、修業年限五年或六年、職業學校之設立、以單科爲原則、如農業中有畜牧、蠶絲園藝等科、可就其中的一科如畜牧或園藝單獨設立一個職業學校、如此辦理、職業範圍較小、則該職業範圍以內所需要的工具、容易設備完全、敎師技士亦容易延聘專門人才、而學生所學得的不是紙上談兵、乃是眞正本領、可以製造國產物品、以解决生計、職業學校單設一科或科者稱爲初級或髙級某某科職業學校、其設立兩科以上者、稱初級或高級某某職業學校如農業工業商業或家事職業學校、合設數業者稱初級或髙級職業學校、此外還有一種短期職業訓練班的制度、以訓練某項業務的技術人員爲目的、可稱爲某某職業傳習所、或某某職業養成所或某某職業講習所等、其程度有初級中學畢業或同等學力者人學的班决、和髙級中學畢業或同等學力者入學的班决兩種、訓練期間、規定三個月至十五個月、視職業的性質、酌量訂定時間的長短、</p>
<p>職業學校山省或直轄於行政院之市設立之、但以地方之需要得由地方設立、或兩縣以上聯合設立之、私人或團體亦得設立職業學校、二十九年度中央撥欵八十九萬元、以九十五萬元籌設國立模範職業學校、以三十萬補助公私立優良職業學校、以資鼓勵、據敎育部十年度的統計、全國共有職業學校三百十二校內、髙初級合設者四十二校、高級者七十四校、初級者一百九十六校、此外其他學校附設之職業科一百十七校、內髙級者七十七校、初級者四十校、全國職業學校之學生、共有四萬一千五百三十二人、內髙級者一萬五千二百五十四人、初級者萬七千百七十八人、每一萬人口中、所有職業學校學生不到一人、與中學生相較的爲一與十之比、其數量實在太少了、</p>
<p>由上述的三種學校——中學、師範學校及職業學校學生數的統計看起來、每萬人口中有中學生十人、師範生二人、職業學生不到一人、這固然是師範學校及職業學校比中學較少的原故、遵照敎育部規定各省市中等敎育經費分配標準、中學佔百分之四十、師範學校佔百分之二十五職業學校佔百分之三十五、應該促進師範學校和職業學校之增設、但一般人民受了傳統觀念「士爲四民之首」的影響、旣然輕視農工商人、就是小學敎師也認爲是未能顯達的讀書人所幹的事、所以一般人多送其子弟入中學、而不願意其子弟入職業學校、或師範學校、許多靑年的思想、亦是如此、假使一個子弟、天資聰明、家道亦好、固應由小學而中學礙續受基本科學的訓練、以期升入大學或專門學校、而改從職業則宜察其個性、適於學習師範或他秿職業而使其投考師範學校或職業學校、畢業後充當小學敎師或從事生產較爲有用、免得勉强升學、一事無成難以找到適當的職業、道是很値得注意的一點意見、</p>
<p>（三）全國高等教育狀况</p>
<p>第二髙等敎育狀况在敎育系統中、比中等敎育髙一級的敎育稱爲髙等敎育、髙等敎育機關、大致可分爲專科學校·大學·獨立學院·及大學硏究院四種、</p>
<p>專科學校以敎授應用科學養成技術爲目的、招收高中或同等學校畢業或具有同等學力者、修業年限爲二年或三年、得由學校各依其種類分別定之、而醫學專科學校修畢三年課目後、須再實習一年、據敎育部二十二年度的統計、全國共有專科學校二十一校、計國立者五校、部立者五校、省立者十一校、市立者、校、私立者九校、就其設科性質言之、設醫科——理農工醫科——者十二校、設文科——文法商敎育——十八校、文科較實科多九校、群細言之、全國有藝術專科學校七校、醫藥專科學校　校、豐藝　科學校、體育專科學校各四校、工業專科學校商業專科學校各二校、商船警官水利工程師範國學圖書館專科學校各一校、全國專科學校共有學生四千五百十一人、計公立者二千三百六十三人、私立者二千一百四十八人、公私相較、學生數相差無幾、而學校數則公立較多十二校、（未完）</p>

<h3>蘇聯最近體育概况（續）</h3>
<p>— 宋如海</p>
<p>蘇俄體育指導員，按其所授教育程度，分為四等。一九二六年春，中央特設訓練班，招收第四等指導員，以備提髙彼等體育學理與運動技能，計加入訓練者，有七千六百人，莫斯科與列寗格城，二個體育專門學校，爲提髙第。等體育指導員程度，附設特別班，入　者一千餘人，現敎育當局感覺各級學校所產出指導員，尙不敷分配，故决定在一九三六年秋，增設（甲）四個體育專門校，招收學生八千人，（乙）六所中等學校，招收學生五千人。（丙）各鄉村開設短期處育訓練班，由以上學校對量觀之，蘇俄訓練體育人才，無微不至。據如海赴各國考查結果，則蘇俄體育界服務人員之員之改量，較諸任何國爲多。</p>
<p>蘇德體育旣如此發達，共問育建業費，興體育用品消耗費，實有研究之價值，一九三五年，政府提倡體育用費，總計五萬萬羅布。（每個羅布合國幣一元三角）俄皇時代體育用費，僅八萬羅布，一化三六年，政府在各處建築體育塲費，已達萬萬難　，各廠售體育用品，價値總計三萬萬一千八白萬羅布。以此婁字觀之，蘇俄社會體育普及與著效，誠一日干里也。國內有兩個最大體育會之組織，一名Dyname.名Spartak兩會提倡體育設力，訓練特殊技能之人才頗多，Dyname體育會，設有體育用　製造廠，該廠出品，現佔全俄白分之六十，每年所得盈餘利息，均爲提倡體育用途。</p>
<p>總以上之事實觀察，卽知其體育發展迅速與普及之緣因，有二注意之點，第一點卽是Stakhanorite運動在一九三六年為最盛時期。該運　增加工人　民經濟能力，而造成社會繁榮，使體育發展格外普及，第二點，一九三六年，中央體育委員會所發之獎章，達六百餘萬。亦卽　明社會體育之成效，巡步非常，但蘇俄寫提倡體育會定以下之口號。</p>
<p>（一）年鍛錬體格，備準勞工服務與國防。</p>
<p>（二）要使個倘靑年有智有力，製成健全國民。</p>
<p>（三）增加全國體育技能與工作效率。</p>
<p>（四）特別的敬心誠意注重工人健康。</p>

<h3>雜糧業昨向市府請願　撤銷江浙兩省禁令　並擬滬市米麥國內流通辦法</h3>

<h3>紗布交易所奉令扣押棉花棧單　銀錢業昨天聯席會　當塲議决請求法院免予扣押　交易所向法院請願陳述理由　法院已允變通今日可以交割</h3>
<p>華商紗布交易所奉第一特區法院令假扣押棉花棧單、以致今日交割、勢必發生困難、特推派理事長穆藕初、理事聞蘭亭、向法院請願、同時銀錢兩業公會、開聯席會議、議决請求免予扣押、以資流通、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>法院令交　易所扣押</p>
<p>華商交易所日前奉第一特區法院令、「因有甲乙兩商人交易棉花十餘萬包、於甲交易之際、乙認爲所交之花、不合標準、以致經甲乙兩商人自行談判無效、由乙向第一特區法院起訴」、當由法院飭該交易所對甲之棉花棧單、予以假扣押、以資打樣試騐品質、該交易所查無甲乙兩戶名、所以據情呈復法院、昨晨再奉法院令、仍遵前令辦理、</p>
<p>今日交割　發生問題</p>
<p>華商紗布交易所以棉花棧單爲無記名式、市上流通、祇憑棧單而不憑人、如果遵法院令予以假扣押、則今日紗花交割之期、事實上勢必發生問題、同時銀錢兩業有抵押關係、影響亦鉅、所以由該所函請銀錢兩業公會開聯席會議、一致主張、請求法院免予假扣押、以資流通、</p>
<p>銀錢兩業　聯席會議</p>
<p>銀錢兩業會會、於昨日下午三時、在香港路銀行俱樂部、舉行聯席會議、到兩會執委吳蘊齋·吳蔚如·瞿季剛·王伯元·胡錫安·齋雲靑·潘久芬·楊介眉·張佩紳·劉午橋·陸書臣·徐文卿等、列席者銀行公會秘書長林康侯·由吳蘊齋主席、宣讀紗布交易所來函原文後、卽開始討論、認爲假扣押棧單、事實上確有困難、當塲議决、呈請第一特區法院免予扣押以資流通、至下午五時始散、</p>
<p>請願之後　予以變更</p>
<p>華商紗布交易所理事畏穆藕初、理事聞蘭亭、於昨日下午二時、赴第一特區法院謁院長郭　觀、陳述假扣押事實上困難之理由、請求收回成命、由承辦書　官代見、至下午三時許始辭出、新　社記者昨晚向該交易所探悉、第一特區法院已允予以變通辦理、所以今日交易所之交割、可無問題矣、</p>

<h3>兩共黨　反共宣言</h3>
<p>願在三民主義旗幟下　爲復興民族工作努力</p>
<p>中央社云、本市市公安局、爲共黨丁偉生·孫孟孚·二人自首、特於昨午二時招待未市新聞界、席間由孫丁二人發表反共宜言、照錄如下、</p>
<p>（一）丁偉生（卽帥昌書）自從「九一八」到現在、這整整的五年間、中國遭遇了空前的磨難、民族危機日益深刻化、使得每一個中國人都覺醒起來、認淸日本侵略中國、不是偶然、而是根據於田中奏摺的整個計劃、認淸日本侵略中國、不會適可而止、而是企圖整個呑滅全中國、武裝進攻綏察、華南海軍演習、普遍全國的走私、接連不斷的領事會議、武官會議、更加以成都事件、北海事件、漢口·上海。日水兵事件、給帝國主義進攻的機會、這證明中日關係在目前是緊張萬分、中華民挨臨到了生死存亡的關頭、中華民挨旣然臨到了生死存亡的關頭、中華民族無疑地只有以全民族的力量、才能爭取生存、否則只有滅亡、所以復興民族、成爲一個中國人唯一的任務、我旣然認定復興民族、是每一個中國人惟一的任務、所以國際主義階級鬥爭之於中國、必然地給與否定、在民族危機到了生死存亡的關頭、要以統一戰錢、號召全民族的力量、來進行救國工作、這是對的、但以統一戰綫爲美名、實際進行階級鬥爭、以抗敵救國的口號，而實際進行蘇維埃工作、這必然會消滅民族的力量、破壞復興民族的工作、那是莫大的罪過、我個人願意拋棄共黨主義的立塲、站在中華民族的立塲、在三民主義的國民政府領導之下，爲復興民族的工作而努力、在過去政府與人民之間、對復興民族的工作、在形式上容或有些出入、我認爲是因爲政府與人民所處地位不同、政府以責任艱鉅、故不能不採取穩健辦法、而民衆却激於義憒、行動猛烈、但民衆是抗敵基礎、政府是民衆的指針、政府與民衆的協調、始能發生偉大的力量、但必須政府居於領道地位、民衆出以擁護熱誠、才能恊調、才能有偉大的力量產生、政府抗敵决心與實際的準備、這是每一個中國人應該馨香禱祝的、我希望政府今後對於民衆、該更給與領導與敎育、使民衆能深刻地明白政府的政策、把民衆的力量都滙合在政府領導之下、完成民埃復興的任務、我深信祇有民衆的力量滙合在政府領導之下、民族復興的任務才能完成、許多中國人還在醉生夢死中過活、政府應該多努力於喚起工作、爲政府用、至於準備工作、異常重要、沒有準備、絕對談不上抗戰、有了民衆、有了凖備、更有了政府的領導、抗戰才有勝利的把握、民族復興的基礎、始能奠定、</p>
<p>（二）孫孟孚　余生不辰、際此動亂之時代、就余個人之能力與旨趣而言、則僅適宜於爲一學者、靜索其搜、以求眞理、若在昇平之社會學術競爭、余自揣尙有一寸之長、不幸余處此環境、國家多難、橫逆紛集、允以九一八之變、對余刺激特甚、乃爲邪說所乘、誤入共黨、隨後余自知非宜、但脅裏之下、不能自拔、未幾卽被捕入獄、在獄時余痛定思痛、深自懺悔、乃誓嗣後絕、不參加政治活動、將專心致志於科學研究、則雖在現時環境中、亦或可稍有所成、於國家社會不無裨益、出獄後、余盡力遵此誓言、期能實現、惟以在政治方面、僅爲消極的、未能把握正確之中心、而於不自覺中仍殘留過去之流毒、故此次再度被捕、現余經明晰之開導、幷長時間之反省、益感昔日盲動之誤、及避免任何政治關係而不就正，確領導之不澈底、夫共產主義、原不適於若中國之决殖民地國家、而階級鬥爭等理論、在我國更足以削弱己力、招致外患、如此之謬脫、余本早已放棄、而近頃所謂「聯會戰綫」「國防政府」種種表面抗敵之口號、余現亦洞察其根源、誠屬共黨理論之變換、用以煽感民衆，篡奪正統而已、就目前局勢而言、抗敵救國、固爲第一要策、惟必須在政府領導之下、集中國力方能有濟、不然則分崩離析、內部先潰、何能抗敵、我國自國民革命以來、已進爲三民主義之國家、循此正軌、自能向上發展、解除一切內憂外患、而躋於眞正自由平等之域、至若其他政治學說及流派、對於我國、槪爲有害無益、此非僅在理論上可證明、而在事實上亦可徵騐者也、余今旣發願改過自新、此後當在三民主義旗幟之下、竭盡棉薄、效忠黨國、區區憑誠、匪能畢宣、惟冀在他日之行動中、更能有所表現焉、</p>

<h3>箱屍案昨讥結　林根弟檢驗無精神病　茅阿根等仍堅稱被評　庭諭定下月五日宣判</h3>
<p>無頭箱屍案上次開庭時、因被吿茅阿根蔣　菼之辯護律師范剛·沈孝祥、請求將　板上之血液、與盛屍之籘箱上所留血痕、是否同素、及林根弟有無精神病、予以　定、故經改期、茲此點業由特一法院送交法醫研究所檢騐、結果認定林根弟並無情神病、而床板之血與籘箱之血是否同素一點、因　時已久、且染有石灰質、故</p>
<p>不能斷定</p>
<p>昨日午後、此案由特一法院鍾淸推事偕張宗儒檢察官升座刑開庭續訊、捕房律師張師竹稱、在改期之內、存福里號之管弄人葉奎玉、重經捕房予以傳訊、據稱、於本年八月三日下午一時、有女千二人、至存福里租屋、因房租須三十餘元、嫌太貴、未租成、父至一號、亦以房租須二十五元未談成、該二女子一年約二十餘歲、身髙五尺三寸、短髪、衣</p>
<p>黑藍旗袍</p>
<p>白色滾邊、另一年約二十歲、身髙五尺二寸、似屬寗波口音當時曾　分租二號之亭子間、據葉稱、並未租給、今葉亦在庭、請予訊　云云、繼由葉奎玉投稟前情、庭上訊以該存福里二號確否會經租出、葉答實未租出、如有虛言、願甘受罪云云、旋山華探目黃福森投禀調查葉奎玉之經過、庭上卽向林根弟質訊、推供、死者確定彩英，由蔣元英殺死時茅亦在塲、日期爲八月九日下午二時、我</p>
<p>實未動手</p>
<p>云云、茅阿根供、此事實為林所誣陷、八月九一日、我與六百十九號·六百五十五號·六百零九號·六百四十四號·六百三十七號救火員與一百八十一號·一百六十二號·一百六十八號·四十二號·一百十二號·一百七十士號·六頭目比賽排球、完畢後晚餐、始終未離開救火會等語、而蔣元英則堅稱被誣、庭上以事實明瞭、論令開飴辯　、卽攄捕房張律師起稱</p>
<p>本案破獲</p>
<p>旣然有人報吿又非捕房自動拘捕、乃屬林根弟於九月二日在卡德路烟紙店門口對人無意中談及致而破獲、若林存意誣陷、則儘可向捕房吿發、且經檢騐得林實無精神病症而其供詞、又始終如一、毫無顚亂情形卽蔣元菼在初亦予供認、據供其殺死彩英原因、實由於爭風吃醋而起、且在庭上履勘時、亦均供認、故</p>
<p>犯罪事實</p>
<p>十分明衆、應　依法判决、未由范剛·沈孝祥為被生辯稱、關於本案至現在爲止、尙不知沒殺在究爲何入、雖據林根弟供死者爲彩英、住於存福里十號然恙調查所得、該里之二號亞無彩英其人曾居於內而林所供行兒日期初謂八月八日、後終捕房查　茅阿根於是日全天在救火會辦公、乃改稱爲八月八日、且大新公司揚州班之一號女招待</p>
<p>名朱鳳蘭</p>
<p>而非彩英、更查林根弟所供則後矛盾、無一可信應請庭上宣吿　罪、庭上旋將特一法院法醫張炎關於騐屍時之報告給兩造律師閱看、據稱大凡身體上失去全部血液、其水分减少、則屍體變化、較普通情形特別緩慢、又屍體消解之時間、亦大人於死後可持續至　十八小時、故死者於受檢騐時、的死後五十小時左右云云、庭上乃又指定范律帥爲林根弟</p>
<p>辯護之下</p>
<p>張檢祭官論吿意見、謂在騐屍時、騐得頭腿所砍甚平、非慣於刀斧工作者、决不能有此手段、今本案茅蔣被吿、旣屬救火員、平日工作、均履用斧、則情節相吻合、月林根弟供詞一致、蔣元菼在初常庭承認、又經捕房查　被吿所用之斧、故其自白、白應採取、今本案旣有犯罪地、又有證物故應認爲有證據、請爲依法判决云云鍾推事遂宣吿辯論終結、定上一月五日上午。時宣吿判决</p>

<h3>糧食　北地糧價高　麪粉多頭躍　各月漲三四分左右</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份又呈激漲之象、洋麥報價、雖小一角零、惟業外人心、因洋麥雖有謠傳、不過就事論事、尙難脗合、故開價後、買戶又甚活躍、各月份較之前日卽好二分、二盤以後、交易甚暢、因浮多吐出、稍見軟弱、迨至下午開盤、初尙平靜、旋以各路客帮、因北地糧價、迄未見鬆、且有幾處巳較申地爲高、致投機者又復利用、吸收甚猛、各月份遂又漲二三分、觀察後步、如洋麥始終未能接近、業內外人心、似不免躍躍欲動云、</p>
<h3>現貨依然堅昻　期麥仍難鬆落</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市而、上午開盤各月份又呈逐步髙昂之態、洋麥報價、雖見微小、惟以現麥情形、依然堅挺良以產地扳緊、販運者自然不肯鬆脫、故開價時、市氣遂聚較前日好二三分、迨至下午開盤、因粉市又漲、現髙麥反提五分、故開價父較上午漲三四分、各盤交易、則未見大暢、現麥市面、特髙貨反提好五分、中次如常、開山東麥六元一角、次六元零七分、明光麥六元零七分、洋河麥六元零五分、南京麥五元八角三分、次至八角、廣水麥五元七角八分、次之七角、江北麥五元九角、崇明麥五元八角、次七角半、漢口車麥五元九角四分、次九角二分、天台麥五元九角一分、髙郵麥五元八角八分、東台麥五元九角，由福新辦二萬包、阜豐辦八千包、申大辦四千包云</p>
<h3>杜尖店銷復見旺盛</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、共到四十四五號、貨共九千餘石餘內以新薄稻居多、而浦中存積又夥、故新薄稻市况、雖包胃續有平津靑烟等帮辦茶種四五千包、及厚新粳四五百包終、以本街銷塲猶潛、形勢仍屬平常、新薄稻及厚新粳行情呈平定之局、至於杜洋尖、則以城鄕　胃再度活躍、續提一角、洋尖升角半、厚薄破粳時已落令、仍無一定標準、新陰元去路呆頓、價再削落一一角不等、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下來源三十號左右頂破粳特新粳去化呆滯、價形平定、中决破粳新粳銷塲雖不爽利、後市見緊數分、羊埠客尖價加一角、杜尖跟起五六分、茶　本市胃口平淡、包子去路不絕、價形和平、新陳變元價短一角零、陰元價跌角外、身份潮軟尙無去路、</p>
<h3>粵方又來暢辦糙秈</h3>
<p>昨日客秈到頭雖旺、然去化更活、機糙髙次一致上升、糙米爲粤帮暢辦、成交達一萬包以上、機米由夸帮北洋河南及本街汕頭等爭辦、且傳產地價勗、將有禁運之舉、江西帮反有在市抵進、又傳上游缺米價昂、亦有赴申採辦之意、因此人心更佳、髙米激漲一角至二角、中關米客化更活、乃激漲三角矣、統市開出湘贛鄂各米一萬八九千云、</p>
<h3>豆價又受連豆貶價影響</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆交易尙不寂寞、統市做開各路靑黃豆七千六百餘包、由福州厦門汕頭本街廠家等銷去、但市兼續被大連豆冉度貶價之打擊、昨榨油廠續訂進十一月內交四平街豆五車價爲五元三角、比後市再跌一角、其他各豆因之牽動下挫五分一角不等、芝蔴洋莊不動、大局殊少樂觀、現貨毛蔴交易稀少、昨祇開毫州蔴三百七十餘包價爲九元九角七及九元八角云、</p>
<h3>糖市　甘蔗歉收　新糖成本難免提高</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平平、公會劃盤無甚更動、如二四粗砂白現貨二十一元六角、較髙者爲二十一元七角、轉口貨六元二角、轉口十號荷赤下月一日可到者劃者六元一角、東白四號（J）嘜六元四角半、九號現貨TM嘜二十一元三角、餘乏上落本廠綿白金心大華振記一號均呌原價、國產近以銷路不旺、人心軟化、兼之距出新漸近、故市價有續鬆之可能、但查產地情形、與申市逈異、聞產蔗之區現以雨水稀少、發育不足、勢必歉收、是以蔗價比之往年須高起四元之譜、預料新糖或將比現市爲髙、後市似難過賤、據報最近產價如上提靑劃申須上三元九角、上黃崗靑十三元七角、下檔貨缺、如隆江靑甲子靑亦需十二元六角、上枝洋十八元半、次不一、奇白粉白均吿斷檔、</p>
<h3>南北貨　泉　泡圓開出五千件</h3>
<p>桂圓近以銷路活潑、市勢回緊、如泉州·興化·同安·漳州·安海·等處產價均已回升、此間號方日前所到泉州泡圓五千餘箱、除其中有一部交拋貨外、昨已如數開通、如上檔漲起三四元、中下檔亦升二三元至四元、惟最小粒因有粤貨軋脚、無甚上落、據產區消息、反較申市爲髙、如後市去胃不衰、或須再漲亦未可知、</p>
<h3>絲茶海外絲市尚稱堅穩</h3>
<p>昨日海外絲市、漲跌互異、紐約橫濱交易所市盤、似已漲足回跌、計紐約近期跌一分半、遠期跌四分、橫濱現貨跌十五元、期貨跌十元、但國外絲商持價、則仍堅挺、如昨日紐約日絲八三及七五匀度、上海絲與廣東絲等之討論、一律提升二分許、里昂日絲漲一法郞、其餘華絲悉持原價、由此觀之、海外市氣仍不失堅穩、但與申市相較、尙難符合、蓋邇日滬埠升漲迅遠、遠逾海外、故昨日絲市、不免淸堅、交易甚爲寥寥云</p>
<h3>珍眉珠茶交易尚旺</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市、路莊平水兩路綠茶、交易繼續暢旺、英莊怡和協和錦隆各洋行、因日前國外來電定購之貨、尙未足額、連續補進千餘箱、路莊以中莊珍眉及頭號珠茶交易最多、平水以眉茶去胃最旺、定價均與前數日無甚上落、惟號家均受虧折、人心仍抱悲觀云、</p>
<p>更正：逕啟者、　閱十月二十貴報商業新聞　茶市所載、小棧沽與怡和亨興隆珍眉原七六箱、誤　八六箱、胡福生珍眉九四件、價三十元、誤爲二十四元、又沽與錦隆愼昌祥珍眉五八件、價二十三元五角、誤爲三十一元、緣各茶商均遠在皖贛各地、售價箱額、均不能稍有錯誤、否則攸關小棧信譽至、除請將請函敬祈貴報賜予更正外、此後還乞特加注意爲幸、上海昇昌盛茶棧啟</p>

<h3>我們應向魯迅先生效法的</h3>
<p>— 艾蕪</p>
<p>魯迅先生去世了，遺囑第四項中有一句，「忘記我，管自己的生活。」這雖是單寫給他親屬的，其實也適合於我們。自然我們不會忘記他，但除了悲悼，紀念之外，我們還應該向他有所取法，以便今後好好做人下去。</p>
<p>我以爲首先應該向他效法的不是學他的短簡小說，不是學他的隨筆散文，而是取法他對人類的愛，尤其是對被壓迫者的愛，被損害者的愛。</p>
<p>他起初到日本學醫，他說他的目的，是在「救治像我父親似的被　的病人的疾苦」後來從事文藝，並不把文藝當成唯一的東西，愛同寳貝，只「不過想利用他的力量，來改良社會。」所以他的小說的取材，「多採自病態社會的不幸的人們中，意思是在揚出病苦，引起療救的注意。」而在繙譯的時候，也特別注重「被壓迫的民族的作者的作品」。因爲被壓迫民族的作品，多是傳達反抗和所喊的呼聲的。</p>
<p>記得托爾期泰說過這樣的話吧？「世上最有價値的，可以作爲各種使命的根基的，不是對藝術的愛，而是對人類的愛，只有在這處服務的人，方有成功的希望。」我覺得這是頂對的，魯迅先生之所以成功，便是一個極好的設明。</p>
<p>其次應該向他效法的，便是他那份戰鬭的精神。</p>
<p>魯迅先生昔年以文學知名的時候，卽以戰士的聲威出現於社會的。他一生反抗封建社會，反抗帝國主義，反抗黑暗勢力，到老也不衰息。他本可以寫一二十部短篇小說，一二十部長篇小說的，但他不肯，寗願寫許多的雜感文章，這並不是他缺乏題材，或者精力不够，而是他看出了「這時却只用得着掙扎和戰鬭」的。因爲雜感文章，他知道可以作七首，可以作投槍，「能和讀者一同殺開血路的東西。」絕不像小說「揭出病苦，引起療治的注意，」那種有點近乎旁觀的態度的。現在通觀他的隨筆作品，也正如他批評「羅隱的　書」一樣，「幾乎全部是抗爭和憤激之談」的。由這一點七，我們更可以看出他之忠實於人生，較之忠實於藝術，是超過了許多傍的。</p>
<p>附註，引用的文句，全是魯迅先生遺著上引來的。</p>
<p>十，廿二。</p>
<h3>死的相晤</h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>誰相信，魯迅先生是死了！</p>
<p>天是這麽凉，人像是挨到了冷鞭，背上滾過了冰鍊，不是痛，這是陰冷。凝住在一個念頭上：是在夢里麽？陰冷把思緒凍住了。</p>
<p>而且是多少年靑人挨受了這冷鞭啊！—爲了一個在心頭上是溫暖的陌生人，五十六歲的老頭兒，是的，一個老頭兒和大羣的年靑人結下了深的友誼，千萬股的細流在向一個焦點凝聚，「老沒有在道中間劃上一道溝渠。</p>
<p>也許是不用眼淚來哀悼這訣別，而是在冷鞭中停住了一刻呼吸，抓回理智和記憶：這是眞實的呵！</p>
<p>不是麼，在靈堂的正中，正橫臥着那安息了的到死還沒有老的靑年—他的心是那麼年靑，堅强和向上。引路的工作中斷，他放下手燈，向靑年人悄悄地溜走了，留下一片黑暗和荊棘。是那麽突元，讓他咽下了多少可嚀</p>
<p>在角隅里，多少生前熟識和陌生的臉子遏不住激情，在偷偷地掩住了自己的臉，是怕這死的寂靜麽？却又不能自己地抬起紅的眼圈再望一望那花叢中的垂下了眼臉的面龐。</p>
<p>多少個靑年，姑娘和孩子在嘆息：</p>
<p>「還是那麽年靑啊，沒有銀白的髭鬚！」</p>
<p>「他不說話，連一個初識的招呼也沒有打，頭一次也是末次的相晤啊！」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>多少個孩子深深地彎下腰，向這位「老祖父」行禮，他們也許讀過「老祖父」譯給他們的童話，寫給他們的故事，在先生的領導下來致最後的敬禮，小心靈中總會致他們眞誠的感謝的。也許他們相差着半個世紀，幼小使他們對這位「老祖父」少一點理解，但，對於他譯著的書，會多一層親切的罷。</p>
<p>不願馬上離去的人們守在靈堂外屋，是焦灼，是猶疑，是輕烟一樣的難吹散的戀棧。想聽一聽他的聲音，卽使是一聲問好或呵叱；想看一看他的微笑—一分鐘的微笑也是好的。</p>
<p>然而他是死靜的，胸脯一動也不動，沒有一下嗆咳。</p>
<p>花圈花籃不斷地在增加，謹愼地提在年輕人手里，安置在他的頭畔身邊，輕悄得像是怕吵醒了他，輕聲祝福：好好地安息啊！多少隻獻花圈的手在顚抖。</p>
<p>多少人在這天對「死」起了憎恨，因爲它能搶奪掉一些人們所珍惜的生命，「死」是那麽心狠，那麼不容情，捲走了這在人海中偶見的浪花—美麗，强大，有着巨人一樣的雄魄。再也我不到這浪花，它沉落在茫茫大海里，不是消滅，是分化，溶解在新的千萬個浪花里。</p>
<p>更廣大的浪花在生長，用着新生的力量冲激，都是那麼堅固，那麽倔强。</p>
<p>熱情的姑娘們要哭出聲來，把頭朝向着牆壁，猛又憶起門口「肅靜」那兩個大字，把奔放的激情化成了莊嚴的悲哀——沉默罷，沉默是會在葉上舁華成力量。</p>
<p>橫在前面的是長長的路，「活」的人要在道里面呼吸，走路，作事；「活」的人將挺着堅毅的臉子去迎那對而襲來的暴風雨，踢開那一陣晦暗。</p>
<p>大家是相信那位「不老的伙作」在繼續着呼吸，這停頓　是安息，他在偷　着　睛默送着「活」人的步伍，他在　着耳朶諦聽「活」人和黑暗的爭鬥，仲微笑地問後一代揮手。</p>
<p>「他只是在舒鬆一下累疲了的筋骨，他吿一個長假，不許他休息嗎？」一個聲音在人們耳朶里這樣　着。</p>
<p>「他的孩子呢！」有人在哪一個角隅里找到了那七歲的男孩，在他臉上留着父親的影子，天眞的孩子跳躍在母親和親友身邊，還不忘了他的書，他的畫册，他應該感謝他那七年所得到的敎養。</p>
<p>「媽！爸爸……」孩子不知想到了什麽要找父親，小眸子一轉，驀地改了過來：」三爹呢？黃先生呢？」他知道爸爸不會再來說話了，彷佛發覺了空氣的緊張，把小喉嚨也壓低下來。</p>
<p>「死」不會在孩子心頭劃上太淸楚的輪廓，對於這古怪的東西只有陌生和驚訝。</p>
<p>誰相信，「他」是死了！却人人挨到了冷鞭。</p>
<p>前面是長長的路，用千萬隻手再擎起那放下了的火把吧。　一〇，二一。</p>
<h3>哭魯迅先生</h3>
<p>— 葉紫</p>
<p>我患着肺結核和肋膜炎，</p>
<p>他寫信來，寄來一句錢，對我說：</p>
<p>「年靑人，不要急，安心靜養，</p>
<p>病自然會好的。」</p>
<p>但是忽然地，朋友來告訴我他的惡消息。</p>
<p>於是，我哭了起來。</p>
<p>醫生跑來對我說：</p>
<p>「你底熱度太高，你不能哭。」</p>
<p>但是我怎能不哭呢！</p>
<p>看護跑來對我說：</p>
<p>「樂底病很危險，</p>
<p>我們不許你傷心，不許你哭。」</p>
<p>但是我怎能不哭呢！</p>
<p>我們不但是死了偉大的導師，偉大的戰友，</p>
<p>而且失掉了偉大的民族底魂魄。</p>
<p>這——我怎能不哭呢！</p>
<p>我哭了一天，哭了一夜，</p>
<p>熱度髙了，呼吸急促了，</p>
<p>兩個看護跑來嚴厲地干涉我！</p>
<p>「我們不許你哭！」</p>
<p>用一個冰袋冰着我底頭，</p>
<p>用一個冰袋冰着我底胸。</p>
<p>他們想　我底熱度壓低，</p>
<p>想將我的心壓冷，</p>
<p>但是，我怎能不哭呢！（十月二十日，在病院）</p>
<h3>話在青年心裏</h3>
<p>— 黃源</p>
<p>魯迅先生死了，魯迅先生已死了十天了，這是無可懷疑的事實。但我們能相信麽？不，决不，我相信千百萬的靑年也必同聲回答：「不，决不」！</p>
<p>我接釗他的死訊，趕到他的靈牀前，已是他停止呼吸兩小時之後。那時他的手還是暖生生的，我貪婪地註視着他，我似乎看見他的胸口還在呼吸。我知道這是錯覺，我把這秘密保留在心裏。下午遺體送至殯儀館，殯儀館晚上是不能住人的，到夜深時，人散了，祗留着我們五個靑年在那裏守夜。這時夜深人靜，室內一盞朝上按置的電燈，散發着柔和的光，先生安靜和平地睡在四圍繞滿花圈的靈牀上，軍幾次三翻地說：「他沒有死，他是睡着，他好像會生起來和我們談話似的」。在病中，他是常常躺着和我們談話的。我們大家同樣都有這感覺。</p>
<p>這幾年來先生因種種關係，他雖愛靑年，但不能和靑年多多接觸，我們是千百萬的靑年中最幸福的幾個，能常和先生接近，親聆敎誨。但這已是我們接近他的最後的時機了。我站在靈床邊，摸摸他的手，手是冷了，我要多多看他幾眼，　貪婪地注視着他，我似乎依然看見他的胸口在呼吸。我明知道這是錯覺，我不敢告人，把這秘密依然保留在心裏。</p>
<p>第二天遺體栘至廳堂上，自早至晚擠滿了瞻仰遺容的靑年，他們帶着無限的悲痛的心情趕來，一踏進肅靜的禮堂，連遠地望見先生的遺體和肖像，都抑制不熱淚。他們和先生或相識或不相識，但敬仰悲痛的心是一樣的。不僅是敬仰悲痛而已，他們在行過敬禮後，，看看苦鬥了一生的先生安靜地躺着，知道先生的那種苦鬥的精神現在是須要大家夾繼承了，心中就激起了憤恨，踏着堅决的步子跨出了禮堂。我知道先生的精神話在每一個靑年的心裏，將會　出絢爛而光榮之花來的。</p>
<p>到晚上，有六千以上的靑年　悲痛的心情進來，踏着堅决的步伐走出的靈堂又空寂了下來。不，這靈堂是不會空洞而寂寞的，單這一天它已殘留着六千多靑年的深沉的悲痛，和堅决的英勇之氣。</p>
<p>靈前堆滿了花圈花　，先生安睡在花堆裏，我們四個靑年伴着先生睡在花香中。臨睡前，我默默地站到先生的靈前，貪婪地注視着他，我要多看他幾眼，我又見他的胸口在起伏，我把手按在自己胸口，默念着，「先生，你話在我心裏，也話在千千萬萬的靑年心裏。」但我依然把這秘密保留在心裏。</p>
<p>第二天晚上，先生的遺體　　人靈柩，上面蓋着玻璃的蓋，還看得見上半身。我默然站在靈柩前，我貪婪地注視着他，我要多看他幾眼，但我依然看見他胸中在紀伏，我再也不能把　秘密獨自保留在心裏了，我把雨和　呌過來，對他　說：</p>
<p>「你們看，周先生好像還在呼吸。」</p>
<p>他們使同　說：「我也看見他好像在呼吸」</p>
<p>難道人家都　樣犯着錯　嗎？</p>
<p>「不，」我可以說。先生的　　雖死，但他的心，他的精神活着，活在我們每一個人的心裏，活在千千萬萬的靑年心裏！</p>
<h3>他將永遠吶喊着</h3>
<p>— 伊凡</p>
<p>在魯迅先生逝世中給我們的印象，不是死亡，而是新鮮的活力。當他軀體活在世上的日子，他並沒有讓受他影響的人，每天接觸他的顏色聲音；但是當他死後，他的影響不僅仍舊活躍在每一個活人心上，而且活得更加鮮明，更加眞實了。死去的是祇有他少數友好能接近的軀體，而他至死不變節的反抗惰緒，却如火如荼地亮在我們中間，如火如荼地深入世界各處。</p>
<p>在昏黑動亂中間，　們需要亮光，需要朋友，魯迅先生，正是照引我們現代靑年亮光，我們大衆的友人。他指示我們方向，給我們勇氣，他敎我們反抗到底。全世界的靑年都需要魯迅先生，而我們中國的靑年尤其需要他。在中國並不缺乏作家，缺乏的是像魯迅先生那樣强悍的，不妥協的，不　節的硬漢作家。舉眼一看國內文壇，捨了專談風花雪月，以色情麻醉靑年的不論；一些風雅幽默的書生，在國內辦了幾種淸髙自許，玩物喪志的雜誌後，又拾些中國人的所謂風雅，中國人過去的劣點，販到外國去，媚洋人，發洋財法了；也有曾經站在大衆中間，向惡勢力宜戰，到後爲了膽怯，爲了自私，逍遙到友邦去做寓公了；再有因奮鬥遇到挫折，便拋下事業，拋下朋友，去度隱逸生活了；這些都算是作家，都算是活人，但是他們有些被我們忘記，有些被找們唾棄，在我們心上都死去了。我們需要魯迅先生，我們雖不能從軀體的死亡中閒留住他，而他的思想，他的言動，以及由此所發生的影響，却比他在世時將更受尊敬，更眞切的永生在我們中間。</p>
<p>魯迅先生會經說過：「我的仇敵可謂多矣，讓他們怨恨去，我也一個不寬恕」這話不僅是說給他的仇敵們聽，也是講給他朋友們聽的。魯迅先生是死了，他那諷刺的不寬容的筆擱下了；他鋒利的嘴也閉上了；但是全世界的他的朋友，將繼他起來，用他們的筆他們的嘴，他們的拳頭牙齒，他們的生命，向不可寬恕的敵人肉搏。在這中間，你和我，都可以相信便是魯迅先生他自己。我們將在世界的各處，聽到他的喊聲，感到他確切的存在。</p>
<p>十，廿一。</p>
<h3>心痛</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>沉重的悲哀，是會引致突然的劇烈的心痛的。但一個健全的人，怕輕易絕不致于陷人於這種情况。我們通常聽人說爲什麽心痛，有些僅只是裝點門向的辭藻。道自然不過只是推測，假定一個人同別一個人該有同樣感受是不容許的，假定兩個人是同等健全，也不容易止確。就個人說，自己頗覺連向這層上推測也許是不應該的，但頗信有這樣推測却也絕非惡意，這僅對于健全的人的一種欣慕。爲了牽纏了幾年的循環器病，自己的心痛，常常是一觸卽發，看見醫院中病狀的模型會心痛，聽見救護車的喇叭　會心痛，這樣無價値的心痛，便是因悲哀而引起時，自然也不是表示悲哀的深切。用心痛表示悲哀，只有健全的人有那權利了。</p>
<p>衰弱者的悲痛固然是毫無價値的，但牠却會無賴地延續下去。近來心上老印着「呼吸　促，不能安眠，心臟麻彼，溘然長逝」等字句，這些是從一代文豪的逝世消息中　到的。對於他，我不上說什紀念的話，自己的無價値的悲痛，自然史無可說。他儘有許多必許記憶的遺留，而他的臨終時的一些病象，是無須人去記　的。牢印在我心中的那些字，就除了對於自己，毫無些意義。就是對於自己的意義，也不能把捉一一個實在。以爲是。「旣悲逝者，行自念也」嗎？自己　在還不致於如此頽唐。因爲幷未頽唐，然覺得那樣英雄地掙扎到最後的精神，還給　以一種鼓勵的意味嗎？則被病　　抑鬱的心情，却已無須掩飾，自己知道幷沒有把呻吟　揮成另一種呌喚的能力。縱然我願勉强去努力，焉知不還帶着呻吟的意味。老實，我甚至於從別人的健全的文字裏，看出痛苦的意味。自然，偉大的作家的東西，許多都是用極痛苦的心寫成的。但我奇怪地會以爲那許是作奢眞就帶着病。難道這就是我記住逝者病象的意義嗎？</p>
<p>讀契訶夫的晚年著作，每使人眼前浮起他那被病纏磨住的身樣。看別人寫的關於契訶夫的晚年生活記載，他在日常生活中還竭力顯示出安靜，愉快，但在他自己的著作中，却不能不自然地流露出痛苦的心情。這也許不一定是無意的，因爲他本來對於憂鬱性也不掩飾。和他患着同樣的病的高爾基，完全是不帶悲觀色彩的了，而在他的著作裏，也不能說沒有由病形成的因素。他的著作中有許多地方，我們不能不帶着急促的呼吸讀下去，恐怕作者也就是在急促的呼吸中寫成的。苦痛的化裝，我們本無須去窺識，去窺識也許是對作的侮犯，但由於病的心理，不由不看成這樣，也是沒有辦法。說這是不健全的想法也可以，說這是荒繆的想法也可以，這是無須推却的責備。除非逝者對這種心情或能加一點憫念，便在他生前，也是不容許的</p>
<p>不久前某作家曾有一篇文字申述他一篇小說中的　病患者的主人翁的心理，這與那作家自己也許無關，但在那作家的各種作品中，同樣性格的主人翁，却屢屢出現，也多少可認是在反映着自已，或反映着某一個眞實的人。那主人翁就具有拼命工，容易憤怒，蔑視愚蠢　等性格，於是他的死亡乃成爲自覺的必然的死亡。這一型的人物，讀者是幷不完全同情他的，且可以說有些人簡直很不同情。然如果作者的意見是容許推測的，則道類人物，正是作者用勸誘人去同情他們的筆墨寫出的。讀者的情緒不與相應，就是因爲病　　因素被忽視，因之作者要來特別提出。然經作者特別提出後，無病的讀者，怕還不能起什　改變。病　一因素，太過被人認爲是心的，可改變的，而忘記牠是物的，無可抵抗的了。至於帶有相類　病的讀者，作者就不提出那病，也自會感到，幷也担心作者是以同樣的病的，心情寫出呢。這樣就不但自己會心痛，且爲作者心痛，爲這類型的人物心痛。這心痛可以說毫無價値，但，怕總有我所解釋不出的理由。</p>
<p>我不確知道肺病能　帶牽起怎樣程度的心臟變態，是不是有些患者只有到最後才起心臟變態，用心病者的心理，云窺識肺病者的心理，固怕未必就能適合。但只要不是痛苦完全不同，則所推測的許不致全是誤解。而那不須要的記憶，也就自有其成爲記憶的原因吧。</p>
<h3>默默的偉大</h3>
<p>— 易貝</p>
<p>「我好像一隻牛，喫的是草，擠出的是牛奶，血。」（註一）</p>
<p>於今，我是更覺得牛的偉大了。在未曉的寒天，踏着霜冷的土地，拖着重重的鐵犁，吁吁喘息，靜靜地把堅頑的瘠土翻起，帮助種子生長的，是牛；而一生來啃着乾枯的草莖，拿出無價的力氣與滋養的乳和血來，一直到死的，也是牛。然而更加使我們覺得悲壯的，却是：即使是吁吁喘息，也還是眞誠地默然擠出力氣與乳血來。在我們這祇聽見大呌「鞠躬盡瘁」騙人的世界裏，我們眞難以想像牛的崇高了。</p>
<p>然而這人間，「一方面是莊嚴的工作，另一方面却是荒淫與無恥」（註二）——之外，還能說些什麼呢？遺憾的是：即使那些萬千狗羣的姿意狺狺，也一點無法掩沒牛底崇髙與偉大。使我們依舊確信：「無論在那裏，在瑣微的自我享樂中，都有想慰撫人類的人；無論在任何時代的任何國家裏，都有對醜惡可憎的現實發出反抗的呼聲的叛逆者存在着。。……這些叛逆者們，結果總是指示人們以應走的路，將人們推送到那條路上去……是打破那或則使人與舊社會所造成的現實的醜惡相妥協，或則使人沈溺於逸樂的　種說敎者底工作的。」（註三）</p>
<p>在我們底時代，在我們底國家中，我們是有了魯迅先生。他默默地與人問的卑汚苦鬥了一生——是的，應當說這「默默的」偉大將永遠閃燦在我們中間。他沒有嘆息過一聲疲勞，「他不知道休息」，而當他死後，僅僅從他最親切的人底口中傳出這一縷悲壯的　音。想着這，我們是忍不住流下悲慘的感激的眼淚了。是的，魯迅先生應當說是一條偉大的牛，他底辛苦是與牛相像的：也曾不斷地拖着重累的鐵犁，在未曉的寒天中踏着冰凍的長路來了，耕墾了瘠土，帮助了地上的可愛的種子生長。「吃的是草，擠出的是牛奶，血。」然而他也和牛不同：他底乳血絕不曾滋養劊子手身上的橫肉——反之，却毒殺了他們。他底無價而辛酸的乳血，是滋養了未來的新的一代的。</p>
<p>而今，這條「偉大的人類底偉大的牛」是永遠地離開我們而去了。留在我們心上的，是一片沈痛的除不去的黑影。一想起那偉大的悲壯的聲音，我眞忍不住痛哭了。然而那藏在角落裏的另一些卑汚的欣幸的竊笑，我們是忘不掉的。我們在偉大的「牛」的詔示下，能用眼淚來回答舊世界的嗤嗤竊笑的嗎</p>
<p>不——可是教們不要再說什麼了。在蒼昏未曉的寒天下，人間依然留着千里的脊士，在這時候，魯迅先生底死，在他，在我們，都祇是充滿了說不盡的悲愴與遺憾。</p>
<p>然而，我們允許自己：我們是永遠記得那條偉大的」牛」的——</p>
<p>「吃的是草，擠出的是牛奶，血。」</p>

<h3>魯迅先生　在語文改革上的功績</h3>
<p>— 楚陽</p>
<p>數起魯迅先生在文學上及文化運動上的功績來，從根本問題上着想，首先該推他對于語文改革的偉大貢獻。他是「新胥年」提倡白話文最初的戰士之一，在今日看來，他是頑强奮鬥，堅持到底，力求進步的唯一人了，其他同時代的人，誰不是沉滯在時代中而與舊勢力妥協了—。惟有魯迅先生他從提倡白話文，攻擊殭屍文學，反對讀經復古，掃射「語錄體」，一直到最近的文學主張，魯迅先生都是立於最前綫作韌的戰鬥的人。他的影響，不獨有關乎面　民族文化的變遷發展，而且所開闢的是千百年後的道路。</p>
<p>其次：魯迅先生也是建立新文體最早的大師之一，中國的有新體小說的產生，當自他的寫實作品狂人日記」（發表於一九　　年）始。被稱爲「投槍一擊」或「七首」的雜文不論在量上或質上都沒有人能和他比並——。至於論辯文，那魯迅先生又是別樹一幟，富於獨特的風格和魅力的，尖刻潑辣，嘻笑怒罵，充滿着嚴肅的理智和磅礴的熱情。</p>
<p>此外，魯迅先生從最早到最後都從事介紹外國文學作品的結果，對於西洋文法的採入，外來語的習用，詞彙語彙的倣傚……，凡足以增長中國語文的功用，補救其非科學的缺陷之點，都作了　善最大之努力；我們如果細心硏究他的翻譯或者作品，當可發現了許許多多的痕跡，有的甚至於是不可見的，已經　入了他自己精心製造的文網裏了。就是這些纖微的造就，對於今後的語文的進化和文學學徒們的學習上，都具有很大價値的功勞。</p>
<p>我們單看魯先生卽令祗是在語文的一方面，也覺得他耗費了甚多的心血了吧。</p>
<p>但魯迅先生可敬可愛之處，却是將自己或　人的力量看得極其淸楚，他對於所追求的在精神上從沒有滿足過。「世界無有盡兮，進步無有止期！」（梁任公語），魯迅先生是極透澈的進化論者，本質上具有動的世界觀的人。卽使是他三十年如一日，手不離筆，他用朝夕磨鍊的文字寫成的自己的文章也是總不得意，不斷求進步的。就在他這種不得意與求進步的心境之中，他盡了自已的力量，他走了他應走的道路，也就照見了我們的道路，我們從他得　了指示了。且看我引他說的一設話：</p>
<p>一……別人我不論，着是自己，則會經看過許多舊書，是的確的，為了敎書，至今也還在看，因此耳濡目染，影響釗　做的白話上，常不免流露出牠的字句，體格來。但自己却正苦於背了這些古老的鬼魂，擺脫不開，時常感到一種使人氣悶的沉重。……大半也因爲懶惰罷，往往自己寬解，以爲一切事物，在轉變中，是總有多少中間物的。動檀之間，無脊椎和脊椎動物之間，都有中間物；或者簡直可以說在進化的鏈子上，一切都是中間物。當開首改革文章的時候，有幾個不三不四的作者，是當然的，只能這樣，也需要這樣。他的任務，是在有些警覺之後，喊出一種新聲；又因爲從舊壘中來，情形看得較爲分明，反戈一擊，當制强敏的死命。但仍應該和光陰備逝，逐漸消止，至多不過是橋梁中的一木一石，並非什麽前塗的目標，範本。跟着起來便該不同了，倘非天縱之質，積習當然也不能頓然樂除，但總得更有新氣象。以文學論，就不必更在舊書裏討生活，却將活人的唇舌作爲源泉，使文章更加接近語言，更加有生氣。至於對於現在人民的語言的窮乏欠缺，如何救濟，使他豐富起來，那也是一個很大的問題……</p>
<p>底下說：「我以爲我倘十分努力，大槪也還能够搏採口語，來改革我的文章，但因為懶而且忙，至今未做。……（魯迅離感選集六四頁：寫在墳後面）</p>
<p>魯迅先生眞的沒有做麽？卽是沒有辦，也無關緊要，他喊出他「從舊壘中來，情形看得較爲分明，反戈一擊，易制强敵的死命。」他至少已指給我們「前塗的目標」了。</p>

<h3>…淋病著名學家…　治淋方策集團强化　……確認抗除淋毒方針……　科學的演進已達到新的階段</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>淋菌的最終有力防線……爲血液及體內織巧組織　最對症最根本之治療……乃亢盛全身血球之作用</p>
<p>科學把人類社會帶進了一個新的階段，一切的一切，都歸到有組織和有紀律化，如經濟的統制，政治的獨裁，凡社會上之上層機構底文化，莫不都被歸納到鐵的組織之下，使成爲紀律森嚴之面目。這種集團主義的精神現已充滿世界了。</p>
<p>如果我們試考察近年來的國際醫學界情形，我們也可以看出醫學界充分流露出這種有組織的集團精神，這尤其是表現在淋病治療界上，像淋病療法的漸趨于一致，已足證明科學的權能，可以解決淋病療法之紛歧的困難了。</p>
<p>到了現在，淋病著名學者和臨床醫家，都極力加速治淋方案的集團强化！就是在經多次討論研核下，指定了那被公認的特效蛋白體療法，作爲集體的施用。據統計學家報告，自從醫院和醫師採用此種療法後，淋病在歐洲各國，已大爲殺減它的勢燄！蛋白體爲什麼會有如此效用，就因爲淋菌毒素，乃是潛蓄血中和有破壞血球的作用，故透膜殺菌的局部療法難收全效。而蛋白體恰能增加血球，昂進全身抗淋素，使血球之喰菌作用猛增！故斷根最速，但蛋白體必須合用黃色素以消除局部尿道炎症，則爲效益彰，所以最合理製劑『克淋儂』恰到好處。本劑又治令人色嗣的淋素睪丸炎症，服後可以漸消睪腫，而獲正常生育。</p>
<p>至于合併淋症的關節炎，後尿道炎的攝護腺腫大，以及遺精夾血精囊炎症等症，在服『克淋儂』後，可獲確切治愈。因爲本劑不但能够昂進血球的喰菌機能，更能增加患部細胞，使尿道因淋菌而壞死之組織，迅速恢復。而藥性王道，尤可放心進服！此外，本劑除善治男子一切急慢淋病外，並對於婦女膣炎白帶之淋毒性症候，雅具無上效力；不過最好一方內服本劑，一方外用『卡而雪地』氏陰道片每晚納入陰道內一二片，這樣的治療，我在俄國和回國後，不知收到若干大的效力呢！</p>
<h3>青春腺的受傷　防老與返老辨</h3>
<p>— 日本帝國大學醫科畢業陳敏伯醫師譯</p>
<p>……多愁病患纏足使青春早逝，　……去病衛生即爲駐顏返老之法。</p>
<p>防老與返老，在表面上看去，好象相去無幾。其實有天淵之別。防老是防牠青春早逝，返老是喚回已逝去的青春。大概我們人類的早衰及不早衰，完全被內分泌機能所支配。這種內分泌機能如健全而無病的，那末，牠必待至適當年齡，才會衰老。假使已經到年齡衰老了，要去喚回他的青春已不容易了。但是一個才上廿幾歲的青年，而他的生理上已呈衰弱的象徵，這種青年，他一定患過性病，或過其他不衛生之生活，只要把病治愈，牠的青春仍可喚回的。這種返老還童法却是可能的。因爲這是使生理機能與年齡相符呢！並沒有神秘的地方值得訝怪。</p>
<p>現在許多青年，外表上看去，都覺得暮氣籠罩，其實他們都在發育沒有完全健全的時候，即加以手淫，或者因早婚勤於房事，所以把青春腺中途摧折了。於是人體的發育。頓失常態，貧血，營養不良，肌肉鬆弛，頭髪亦因營養不良而致焦枯化白，或脫落。面呈憔悴之色。尤其是青春腺受傷而致下體發育不全，遺精，早洩，陰莖勃起力不能。兩性的生活，也陷入極苦悶的深淵。他如頭痛失眠，心悸亢進，記憶力不足，判斷力不精，腰酸腳弱完全露出一副龍鍾老態。所以我們要挽救他，喚回非生理的青春早逝，以服『補體康』一藥最爲有力。因此藥係採用少壯期之動物荷爾蒙所製成，復經世界有名醫家證明，『補體康』確有旺盛內分泌，重新改造生殖系組織，俾趨於健全和完整之功效。一切新陳代謝機能，歸於旺盛。故新血增加肌肉充實，面色粉嫩，喚轉本來青春的丯姿。而性神經衰弱等症如早洩，遺精，勃起力不足亦歸治。使兩性的愛情，仍歸融洽。故凡感到性的不滿足，快感減少，及早衰，服『補體康』後無不在五六星期中治愈。惟遺精者，可與『耐而斯遺精片』同時服用，則厥疾無不愈了。牠的成績，絕對超特的。這是我從日本帝國大學畢業返國開業以來，所經騐的事實。</p>
<h3>妨害生育之精囊炎</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師</p>
<p>患者林外山君，於淋病之後，繼以酗變，病勢突變，轉成精囊炎。下腹部作膨滿之感。精囊部之疼痛，放散於四周，陰會與肛門有不快之感。此外且時有膿血流出，時而有疼痛性之遺精，取此等精液塗於玻片上用顯微鏡檢查，則淋菌甚多，與精液及膿血球相混，精虫全數死滅。（如第一圖）長此不治，必致不能生育，用×線與電療後，隨又進服「克淋儂」以喰菌消炎，使放散各處之淋菌全部圍剿而扑滅之，所患盡愈。惟爲證明是否已獲根治起見，在病愈後之二星期，着其再來檢查，抽出血液用顯微鏡檢騐，則毫無淋菌踪跡，爲純正無疵之血液，（如第二圖）因此林君之精囊炎，已得根本治愈之證明。</p>
<p>第一圖　此爲未服「克淋儂」前塗於玻片上之膿球精液，其間蠕蠕而動之淋菌甚多。</p>
<p>第二圖　此爲精囊炎服「克淋儂」獲愈後所抽出血液之檢騐後證明無淋菌</p>
<h3>帶病自療談</h3>
<p>— 宋忠鈺醫師</p>
<p>白帶病，古稱帶下，多由於婦女陰部不潔與粗暴之房事或手淫而來。其陰道有污液涓涓而出，浸潤糜爛，誘發月經之不調，而來停孕小腹膨脹刺痛，精神易起異常，更因招惹細菌之滋生，致有子宮出血及生殖器官機能變易之事。故患者不可不早事根治也</p>
<p>余年來在臨症上之詳細研究，知治白帶患者，以外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」爲最有效。因此片有防腐止泌消炎殺菌之功能。故治白帶最爲相宜，凡應用在四五星期後，即可徹底將帶液滌清。乾潔如處女。惟素有月經不調者，可內服「補女容」，以調經壯體。因淋病而來者，可服「克淋儂」，同時仍用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」爲坐藥。則收效可計日而待矣。</p>
<h3>姚菊巖醫師淋病講座</h3>
<p>（診所）：四川路寗波路轉角　（診時）：上午十時至下午六時。</p>
<p>放任失治之攝護腺炎</p>
<p>淋毒性攝護腺炎，可說是淋病中最易遭遇之症象。但亦爲吾人極易忽視之疾患。因此兩種原因，足以促成淋病症象之險惡。原來攝護腺在生殖器官上，握有極重要之職權，其腺液是精子活動之要素，一旦失之，如魚失水，立即涸斃，故罹攝護腺炎者，如不予以徹底之根治，十九有失孕之結果。患者恒感到排尿困難，淋絲如絮，或雜有血滴。肛門會陰脹痛。其素有神經質者，則每於檢查擬護腺或按摩時，即感劇痛。又往往因此而陷於性神經衰弱，如遺精，早洩，漏精等症。若仍忽視不治，則攝護腺由發炎而成漏，則腺液損失。結果，遂爲不姙之主因。</p>
<p>此病之挽救，宜騐淋與强化生殖系之組織並重。有住華德路之楊永雄君，由前尿道炎轉成攝護腺炎。又因職務絆身，不能全治，平日感到排尿困難，及尿液污濁，時有遺精之患。致體力益感虛耗。與其夫人結婚三年，從未有姙，反將可惡之淋菌，傳染於其夫人，感情遂致氷炭。月前因讀拙著「性病全書」懇余醫治。除行長短電波交互療法外，同時囑服「克淋儂」，俾在病灶上之淋菌，全數扑滅。以消炎利尿，鎮痛退腫防腐。一方服「補體康」以强壯神經，俾生殖系組織趨於强化。前後經過五星期以後之醫治，即全告根治。雖屢酗酒劇勞，均無變動。其夫人白帶，亦教服「克淋儂」，外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」爲坐藥，經過三星期之不斷治療，亦在平安無苦中治愈。去年欣舉一子。足見生殖力已恢復矣。</p>
<h3>腎病實騐錄</h3>

<p>發育不全……陰莖短小</p>
<p>李維廉君，年二十四，學界。</p>
<p>病原：先天本來不足，身體矮小。十四五歲時，又受劣友引誘，染患手淫，致患遺精。</p>
<p>症狀：遺精頗頻仍，身體虧憊。精神萎靡顏面蒼白。體格瘦弱，性器短小，勃起力不壯。若與異性週旋，即覺精液涓流不絕。</p>
<p>診療：余診爲性神經萎頹，荷爾蒙缺乏，乃囑向永安公司購服「補體康」旺充荷爾蒙，並以耐而斯遺精片」治其遺精，並施電療。不出一月，面色豐潤，性能有力，已臻良好發育矣！</p>

<h3>婦女神經衰弱與家庭</h3>
<p>— 南通醫科大學畢業武鍾麟醫師</p>
<p>……是亂家庭愉快的惡魔，　……宜及早解決免遺害日深！</p>
<p>婦女之生理，與男子不同，而其社會上之環境，亦與男子迥異。例如女子之月經病，男子則無有也。凡卵巢機能失常之女子，其月經恒不調，月經不調者，則往往影響於神經衰弱，故經騐告訴吾人，凡患歇斯的里之女子，十九與月經病有關。蓋卵巢與神經，有密切之關係也。又凡患此等病者之症狀，易怒易哭，頭目昏昏，終日如在五里霧中，白帶淋漓，面黃肌瘦。狀若老嫗。凡家中有此等患者，無異一家幸福之惡魔。因此等病人，恒使愉快之空氣，爲之污濁，丈夫之事業，大受影響。此外對於生育上，尤有極大之關係。</p>
<p>「補女容」一藥，爲對婦女神經衰弱患者，極適當之療法因「補女容」一藥，有調整卵巢，補給卵泡刺戟素的不足之功。故能將月經調整通順。受孕力增加。與此病有關係之神經衰弱，自亦治愈。家庭愉樂之空氣自亦洋溢矣。所以「補女容」是家庭快樂之天命！余於南通醫科大學畢業後，即依此法治愈婦女病者，不可以數計，且均在短期中治愈。惟有白帶者除用「補女容」外，可用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」爲坐藥。</p>
<h3>夫婦愛之基礎</h3>
<p>— 陸軍醫科大學畢業宋忠鈺醫師</p>
<p>美滿性生活之保持　爲兩性愛之護身符</p>
<p>在人生的過程中，愛是一種不可缺少的連繫。除了母愛的偉大之外，只有夫婦愛是最真摯的。所以要怎樣才能進一步保持住兩性間的愛，那實在是個嚴重的問題。不容忽視。</p>
<p>我們常可在報紙上看見夫婦失和，妻子另有所歡，而丈夫却在外面遊蕩，可以明白兩性感情冷淡，全是由于雙方性生活的不調和。最顯明的例子，如大家庭的貴婦，不能滿足充分樂趣，往往和車夫私奔等，足見家庭的環境，不管是怎樣幸福，夫婦間沒有適足的性生活，愛情畢竟會破裂的。</p>
<p>這種性愛不能滿足的原因，一大半責任要負在丈夫身上。因爲在婚前丈夫有過手淫的行爲，或婚後房勞過度，就不免罹致性神經衰弱，陰萎，早洩遺精等，或者性器短小，對方毫無快感可言。這種性的障礙，最可靠療法應以荷爾蒙劑「補體康」內服，以旺盛荷爾蒙，濡養衰憊的性神經，則能于極短時日內，全部治愈！</p>
<h3>戒除鴉片之真諦</h3>
<p>— 陳少華醫師</p>
<p>盡不但損害人體性　　並摧毀荷爾蒙妨害細胞</p>
<p>鴉片的毒害，最能够破壞人體荷爾蒙，這種生命力的主要資源—荷爾蒙，一經喪失，便會影響到全身細胞的生活力，因而新陳代謝減退，細胞萎縮，而搆成肌肉消瘦，面色萎黃的症候。</p>
<p>一方神經失去荷爾蒙的濡養，也呈現衰弱，于是失眠，心悸亢進，食減，便秘等症，不絕地到來。所以年久的煙客，只一味以煙毒提神，獲到暫時的麻痺。</p>
<p>煙民因荷爾蒙缺乏，就也無怪　神經趨于衰弱，遂有陰萎早洩之症，欲言戒煙，真是談何容易？有些醫生以爲煙民性腺萎弱，故戒煙方法專事培補性能，其實戒煙最要緊的，乃旺盛全身荷爾蒙：荷爾蒙旺盛，則體內各部肌肉組織神經等，都獲壯健。因此最合理的戒煙法，是應以荷爾蒙劑「補體康」內服的。因此藥之特殊配合，可以清除煙毒，壯實體力和氣血云。</p>
<h3>青年自瀆的惡果與症狀</h3>
<p>— 楊道南醫師</p>
<p>……打破一切成見提出特異的有效療法　……爲遺精及神經衰弱者闢開求生之門</p>
<p>有許許多多的孩子，從小勤敏好動，腦力强健，異常聰明。可是一到十四五歲的時候，便無緣無故的一天天呆鈍起來；思想緩滯，舉動愚笨，肌肉瘦削，而精神更見沉　，失却平常的活潑態度。</p>
<p>這樣的現象，倘使稍爲考察一下，就知道他的原因，不外犯着手淫。因爲手淫的結果，就是遺精，所以一個成熟期的青年，爲了無法抑的性衝動，百分制之九十以上都患着劇烈手淫，同時都患有或輕或重的遺精和神經衰弱症。</p>
<p>對於遺精的療法，爲了許多不合理的藥物充斥市塲，所以患者常感到莫大的苦痛，須知遺精的症候，是精關鬆弛，和神經興奮所致。必須顧到這兩方面的效用，則遺精藥才能服了生效，我在俄國勞働醫科大學畢業後，歷年臨床實騐，確切證實「耐而斯遺精片」治遺精精漏等症，最爲對症。凡大小便後，滴出二三點精液，白日滑洩，夜間艷夢頻繁，遺精多至每日一次者，以此藥最效。最好兼以「補體康」挽救遺精後之衰弱，就更易恢復。</p>

<h3>承認意國兼阿</h3>
<p>— 黎學濂</p>
<p>幾天之前，報上曾傳說他國將承認意大利兼併阿此西尼亞，以爲結成歐洲法西斯陣綫之一個機楔。這消息到意外長齊亞諾抵柏林以後，愈益證實。廿六日，據南斯拉夫京城的電訊說：「路透社傳出消息，南斯拉夫政府日內宣布承認意國兼併阿此西尼亞。此種步驟，事實上無異表示南斯拉夫之加入意德勢範圍。」這末一來，德國之「承認」更無疑的已成爲事實了。</p>
<p>意德兩個歐洲的法西主義的國家相携手，本來是不足爲奇的。大家都是個窮兵黷武的國家，口口聲聲要獲取新的殖民地。阿國首先成爲他們的犧牲品，固不必說；而歐洲的許多小國，以及蘇聯這塊肥沃的土地，隨之也成爲他們的「禁　」，也是盡人皆知的事。爲了獲取新的殖民地，重新分割世界，黷武主義的法西斯國家，自然不能不鼓吹戰爭。最近他們之助長西班牙的叛軍，使之促成一個含有國際性的內戰，即其一例。</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰以還，人們對於慘無人道的戰爭，已經感到非常之厭倦，誰也不願意再釀成這些慘酷的戰禍。因之在第二次世界大戰的威脅日益緊迫的當前，世界爲保衛和平的反戰反法運動之形成及日益增長，也是必然的。和平運動和戰爭的威燄正是兩個對立的形勢，是互相消長的。法西斯主義者爲了擴大戰爭的危機，不得不製造促成這危機的空氣，尤其重要的是結成法西斯的國際組織。—雖然他們的本身也時常發生矛盾，叮是在某種共通的塲合上，卻又變成了這種可能。</p>
<p>爲了這個原故，德國之利用承謐意國兼併阿此西尼亞來渡過以前兩個法西國家底破裂的關口，來促使國際法西陣綫形成之順利，正是極其自然的。雖則最近奥國內衛團的解散，也未嘗不足以影響兩國的關係。可是仍舊不足以破壞這種可能。南斯拉夫之響應這個「承認」，正可以看出這次兩個法西主義的國家之結合，在國際上的影響。</p>
<p>不過，以犧牲阿此西尼亞來促成國際法西陣綫之結合，似乎還不算怎麼高明的手段，因爲這末一來，遠東的「滿洲國」不是同樣可以「承認」了麼？…………</p>
<p>遠東的黷武主義者之日漸趨於法西化，也許將來也有加入歐洲法西陣綫的可能吧？若是，則擁護和平的人們，將更感到困難，而戰爭的危機也益加緊張了。我們將如何以拯救和平呢？—這是亟待我們事實去答覆的。爲了這，我們尤其不能不鞏固我們的和平陣綫。</p>
<h3>樂培園（續昨）</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>拐一個灣，再進去，禁不住的呆住了，神經在受了重重地一擊，說什麼呢？這免不掉的埋藏在都會里的火坑喲！</p>
<p>街的兩惻，是啣接着的平房，每一所平房里，房子並不很多，一進門，有一面阻碍視綫的、大木屏」，屏後是一個小小的院落，兩邊的房子分隔成多少間，每間屋子，說不上什麼陳設，除了一面佔據半間屋子大坑外，只有少不掉的破桌子之類的東西了，紙窗子上，那該是個奇蹟，還有方小玻璃，有二尺見方的樣子，眞够漂亮，小玻璃上還掛着一方紅布哪！</p>
<p>騷臭的氣息從房子里揚溢到街頭，假使你胃淺的話，能忍不住的作噁。</p>
<p>銅板在人們的手里嚮着，哼着不知名的調子和一些淫蕩的言詞，邁了大步，跨進到院子里。姑娘門，不，至少該有三十歲以外了，與其說是姑娘，不如說待宰的猪羊來得確當些，斜了眼睛瞟視着每個顧客。但都沒有話說，假使你認爲那一位能發洩你慾望的話，那，不要經過什麼手續，跑進去，把紅布玻璃簾放下來，同時把房門關好，銅板的代價不要很高，就能使你解决了全部的要求。</p>
<p>男人，不息的進出，能够看得見的紅玻璃簾也在一時掛起來，一會又放下去，天，那靠南面的一間屋子，在不長久的時間里，竟放下有五六次之多喲！如果以整天的統計合算一下，這數目多值得驚人呵！天！</p>
<p>爲了攫取不容易得到的糧食，每次，她們終於用脂粉掩蓋住蒼黄的面孔，倚在門角向人們淺笑。門外的門燈上，寫明是「四等下處」，正因爲這，最低的企望，還是使她們沒有方法獲得。</p>
<p>走出街口，我想把所看見的事實，告訴給將近衰亡的少爺知道：火坑里的人兒在流淚，希望挺脫了加在身上的無情枷鎖吶！</p>

<h3>生活初題</h3>
<p>— 侏貝</p>
<p>——『人間草』之一</p>
<p>生活第一次把他底酷慘的一擊落到我底頭上時。記憶給我記錄着：我是十歲。</p>
<p>十歲，這在一個孩子的耳朵裏——對我，應該是一個奇妙的。迷人的詞兒呀！那個詞兒，在那時的二年前——當我還是一個八歲的孩子的時候，就給了我一個過大的誘惑與閃耀：在我們底住區——那一堆被人家稱爲『東洋房子』的平民住房底對面。有着」所被人稱作『王公館』的氣概的大牆門，烏黑而森嚴，整天地關着不開的。每天每天，我站在弄口的時候，就被一種奇怪的，幾乎是神秘的心情所估據住了，想着在這大黑門裏面的，是一個什麽世界呢？住的是什變人呢——也許是『官』，也許是『大好老』吧？一定的！</p>
<p>可是聽說，那裏還有一座『花園』呢……！</p>
<p>然而終於，有一次那座烏黑而陰森</p>
<h3>談贈品</h3>

<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>的大牆門打開了，門外聚着許多人，許多馬車與轎子；另外有許多像『大好老』一樣的人們，搖着擺着地在門口進出。門裏，深深地望進去，有吹吹打打的，還有許多奇怪的，好看的吃的玩的東西，說是『王公館』裏的王老爺的第一個『少爺』十歲生日——王老爺七十多歲了，就是那麽一個少爺，希奇得不得了的。</p>
<p>就在那時候，母親曾和我那麽說過：『等我們好起來，囝囝十歲，也有那麽多好的東西了。』</p>
<p>誰也不懂被生活壓傷了的母親說這些話語的時候的感慨的心情；我，一個八歲的孩子，便把那個蠹惑的名詞牢牢地記住了：十歲！</p>
<p>十歲了！可是，我們底日子却並沒有如母親所希望的那麽『好起來』；反之，却一天天地壞下去了。那些『東洋房子』裏的人又全是那麽的『不體面』，連對門王公館的當差也比不上。生活對於他們作難得那麽兇，而他們對於生活也完全失了望。在紗廠裏做工做得灣了背的那個禿頂的『回子』（註：回敎徒），就每天晚上吃一碗冷飯，三個子兒的牛肉湯，到晚上同女人淘一回氣，打一場，哭一塲……隔壁那個做假『發財票』的失業商人，天天午夜裏偸偸摸摸地敲開家裏的門去睡覺，唯恐有一天會給抓去坐牢。另一家做鮮魚販的，每天把掙來的錢擲在『花會』裏，輸了錢，連執照捐也付不出，做着生意，便給拉去關起來了。生活對他們扭過了背。就祗有那家在ＸＸ人開的布莊上做掮客的，還能寬裕地度着日子，和他底姘上的女人住一個統樓，時常張開了口，露出一排難看的金鑲的牙齒，吐出猥亵的，下流的嘻笑……</p>
<p>就在那一年，當我們底生活低落得太使人灰心了的時候，大家都不免用一種特殊的——幾乎是敬慕的眼光來看那個ＸＸ貨的洋布掮客了。而我，滿了十歲，也就叨了『鄉隣』的交情，給送到那個掮客那裏去「學生意」了，每天由他把我帶到ＸＸ洋布莊上去，做九個鐘點的掃地抹桌盛飯等的粗工，在旁邊聽那些永遠聽不懂的鳥噪一樣的奇怪的言語。</p>
<p>就在那時候，最初的生活的酷慘的試題落到我頭上來了——而我是十歲了呀——當他們設立了一個呌賈的擔子，要我跟着大人們到各巷去呌賣的時候，一種難堪的羞愧，壓迫得我透不過氣來，我至死也不肯呌喊一聲，我漲紅了臉。</p>
<p>『小孩子那麽强！過日子要有膽氣一點呀！那麼嬌，做公子爺去！你喊不喊：「絲光洋布刮刮呌：……你喊不喊！』</p>
<p>我不喊——我終於沒有喊！可是這一天晚上回去的時候，他們把我毒打了一頓——我不知在什麽時候被送回家裏來了——我彷彿看見母親在我身邊哭泣。</p>
<p>『我十歲了呀。』我糢糢糊糊地想。然而，日子一天天地過去，我底傷也終一於好起來了。生活依舊那麽的壞，日子一依舊那麼灰色：可是，從此我不再得看一那露着金齒的難看的微笑了，這一年已一經過去，是的，我是十歲。</p>
<p>但，「過日子要有點膽氣！」我想那一話也許是有點對的吧？</p>
<h3>邊地</h3>
<p>— 以一</p>
<p>因爲在岩山有了點躭擱，所以在離開那里不久便給黑夜來捉住了，無邊的大野像是才從墨缸里爬出來似的，沒有一點光亮，滿天的星星也給烏雲來遮掉了。</p>
<p>「是吧，是吧，這還不是晚了麼？離郊店至少還有四十里，……在這荒草野坡里，前不歸村，後不歸店，……鬼才知道會發生什麽事情！……」我那老火伴又那樣的嘮叨了，他是那樣低聲的一含糊埋怨着」，似乎是要我聽見，而又一不便公然的說出來，於是他便把滿腔的一鬱積拿馬來出氣了，他尖聲的叱呌着，長鞭在空中裂開了濃重的沉默，這樣，那疲憊的馬便負着創痛開始幾下劇烈的巓波，但很快的牠便又恢復了那遲純的步子，像是一隻蝸牛。</p>
<p>「瞧，天陰得這麼老，又氣悶，要是落起雨來，山水冲下來，那才吃不了的兜若走哩！」老伙伴一壁點上了那盞燻得大半變黑了的桅燈，一壁慢吞吞的講着。</p>
<p>「那麽趕快一點吧！」</p>
<p>「趕快一點？黑夜里牲口是不髙興走路的，快又有什麽用呢！要是少躭擱點時候，少弄些狗耗子（管閒事），也早可以趕到郊店啦，……哼，說了還不聽，呌你不要管，你偏管！怎麽樣呵？還不是活埋了嗎，吿訴你吧，先生！寡婦女人偸了漢子就是要活埋的，這是邊地的規矩，可憐總歸是可憐了，可是你又有什麽辦法呢！」</p>
<p>「這總是太野蠻了，在城里那有這種事情發牛呵！」</p>
<p>「那麽，這只有怪鄕下的不好了！」</p>
<p>於是，在我惱子里便迴旋着岩山那幕活埋的慘劇：那村長的兇惡的面影，那些冷板無情的旁觀者的面孔，以及各種不同的冷嘲，和惡毒的罵聲那女人，那不幸的有着一雙烏黑的大而靈活的眼睛的女人，她使我欽佩，在她臉上找不出半點懼怕的影子，健康和氣憤紅暈了她底雙頰，她是那樣大聲的呌號：「我就是那樣的做了，因爲我是一個女人！我要那樣做……來吧，埋！你們這些不要臉的，不要臉的惡鬼！……」於是她便給那可怕的當頭一擊鐵落在坑里，村長蓋上了第一鍁土，另一面，在樹上綁牢了那個靑年人，他忍受着任何一個男女的唾駡和毆擊！他不講一句話，也不喊一句痛楚，最後，村長便割掉了他底一隻耳朶。——他被放開了。……這可怕的情景便一幕一幕的出現了……。</p>
<p>我向老伙伴望一眼，他正在哆囉着些什麼，那黝暗的桅燈照不破黑暗，但他却是這荒原上唯一的光亮呵！</p>
<p>車鈍鈍的行着，像是一隻蝸牛，隨便鞭聲怎樣的怒呌，牠也毫不理會了。</p>
<p>突然的，從來路上追來了幾聲尖利的鎗聲，那冗長的「叱——」像是把黑暗來劃開了幾條裂縫，馬驚狂的跳了幾跳，往前在奔了幾步，那老車夫扭轉了身子，痛聲的說：「糟了，糟了！……」</p>
<p>但是我們有什麽呢？想到這里我便安心了，我由車蓬的縫里向後窺，除了黑暗又有什麽呢！</p>
<p>「憑天由命吧！老車夫緩緩地趕着馬，他把一隻耳朶轉向了後方，的莫走出了半里路，我們才緩緩了一口氣，但車子已經給一個人由後而抓牢不得前進了，我給恐怖包圍了，我聽到那入的急促的氣喘聲——</p>
<p>「先生！救救我，我給匪人打傷了……先生，恐怕他們還要追下來……」</p>
<p>於是，我放心了。老車夫停了停，摸起了我的手杖，他很靈活的跳下車去，我曉得他怕是有假，但由那人的痛楚中吐出的話語，已經證明他是過慮了。</p>
<p>「是你呵！……」老車夫驚呼了，等我跳下車去，借着桅燈的光亮，我看淸了，他正是岩山的那個被割落一隻耳朶的年青人。</p>
<p>「是，……是你們便好極了，眞是……年靑人在佈滿了血跡的臉上展開來一絲苦笑。我們把他扶上車去，他指了指腿，他給打傷了。</p>
<p>我剛要問他爲什麽會遇見匪人，他却向車夫揚了揚手：「快趕車，別讓他們追上！」那老車夫便握起了手杖沒命的向馬屁股上接二連三的打下去，那馬便瘋狂般的奔下去了。</p>
<p>先生們！……隔了一會兒，那靑年斷續的說：「我眞是愛那女人，雖然死過了丈夫，……可是她爲了我就那樣的被活埋了！我是多麽痛心呵！……咳！我生氣，我幾乎要瘋了，我要替她報仇，於是，我偸偸的跑到村長的家里……我，我把他殺死了！……我，……呵！……年靑人講着講若把臉埋在手掌里，哭了！</p>
<p>沉默了，只聽見老車天重重的歎了口氣，再就是手　打在　　此股上的　　的聲嚮。</p>

<p>前奏曲（藝音社）歌唱（曼娜）（朱珠）</p>
<p>阿Ｑ</p>
<p>他從恐慌中跑回土地祠里去了，爲虎作倀的地保襲進來了，阿Ｑ從此又加上一層抄家破產的苦厄。他不願駡趙太爺，他不怨駡地保；，他也無法怨責吳媽，他只恨那接代他的勞工的小口，他雖曾經和小口起了一塲龍虎鬥，然而這究竟對於他的生活是無補的。他爲饑餓的本能所驅迫不得不到了靜修菴去偷拔那弱者的蘿蔔，然而這究竟對於他的以後的生活也是無補的。於是他又不得不和他所親愛的故鄉辭別了。</p>
<p>他同一位同病相憐的男漢上了城里謀生去了。話雖說他是在白興人家里帮忙，但是「物去鄉則益貴，人云鄉則益賤，」阿Q從本村中的人所接受的譏諷和壓迫，未見得在城里就會受了回情和尊敬罷。至於那白舉人老爺也决不會比趙太爺好的。</p>
<p>以一個人呌他麥便割麥，呌舂米便舂米，呌撑船便撑船，呌劈柴便柴劈的好勞動的阿Ｑ，也會有「做人又刻薄，事務又好忙的一的怨嘆，則白舉人老爺不但不比趙太爺好，反要酷刻多了。阿Ｑ旣不能在白家帮忙，亦斷乎是不能空手還鄕的，於是就挺而走險了。他日錦衣榮　，睥睨一鄕，在村人雖各抱着「與其慢也寗敬」的心理，但是斷不會誤會自舉人能有因愛才而招了阿Ｑ爲贅壻的事，也斷不會誤會阿Ｑ能有在路上拾得一塊黃金的宰運。</p>
<p>因此衣錦選阿Ｑ　不但沒有真實地得著新尊敬，反使人家愈加畏避害，愈加提防他了。趙太爺惱羞成怒地說他……</p>
<p>然則使趙家不遭了搶劫，而阿Ｑ也難逃於槍斃的定數了。他是不是勾結匪徒搶刧趙家的正犯，實在不成一個問題。</p>

<h3>馬彥祥氏　蘇俄「戲劇節」觀感談</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>最大的劇塲「觀衆座」可容一萬餘成名的演員年齡至少在卅歲以上轟動世界的蘇聯「戲劇節」，至今年發爲，在我們中國僅只有今年馬彥祥先生第一次代表參加。戲劇節閉幕，馬先生回國，當然有好些關於藝術方面的新鮮材料帶給我們</p>
<p>蘇聯戲劇之發達，爲世界各國的先驅，這是無可諱言的事實·以劇塲而論，單只莫斯科一處，已有六十幾個，而完全都是國家經營的。可是蘇聯政府對于藝術之注重。劇塲的建築，演員的精神，以及其他一切，都是値得世界各國所參考的。我們每個人腦筋裏都有了一個這樣的印象。昨天，馬先生到上海，筆者獲得一個偶然的機會，晤之于旅邸中，叩問他這决蘇聯戲劇節的觀感。據他告訴我們的是：</p>
<p>一蘇聯劇塲的一觀衆座」比較大的可容一萬數千觀衆，最小的也可容二千多人。每塲戲劇的演出，「觀衆座裏都是滿滿的，其中觀客，以工人農人爲主體。這一點在世界各國可以說是絕無僅有，而在蘇聯就有這樣好的現象。蘇聯文化的水準，可想而知了。現在蘇聯每個八歲以上的孩子，絕少沒有不識字的。</p>
<p>「蘇聯的演員，沒有苟且，每一個劇本上演，排練的時間至少須在半年以上。臨上演的早晨，不管這劇本曾經演過與吾，必須再排練一决或二决，縱然是演過幾百遍的熟戲，演員並不覺得麻煩，這點也是世界各國至少是我國所沒有的精神。</p>
<p>「一個演員的訓練或一個演員的成功，並非偶然的事，也不是經過了報紙雜誌的幾决吹捧，就能一躍而爲明星。訓練一個演員，至少要有七八年的舞台經驗，同時把人生的經驗，也需要體驗到，才有扮演一個决要配角的機會。並且，實際演技與理論，須不斷的研究，以到老死爲止。蘇聯一個成名的演員，年齡至少在三十歲以上，女演員亦如此，非如我國之講求年輕而漂亮者可比。（未完）</p>

<h3>Unlicensed Japanese Residents in Bingyuan Smuggle and Sell Drugs, Causing Trouble; Japan Raises Serious Protest; Sending Overseas Chinese Out of the Country is Insulting; Increase Troops and Police Under the Pretext of Protection</h3>
<p>Japanese Military Claims Negotiations Failed and Will Take Self-Defense Action</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hezhong Company case in Bingyuan involved Japanese residents Tanaka Yoshio and Takeda Sueo, who arrived in Bingyuan on the 8th without licenses. They colluded with traitors, rented houses under assumed names, established Hezhong Company, smuggled and sold drugs. Knowing the truth about the situation in the house, they feared being punished and reported it to the authorities. The Jin Court sentenced the lessee to imprisonment and ordered Tanaka to vacate the house, which he refused. Following common practice in Chinese lawsuits, the court sealed the house. Tanaka tore off the seals and protested to the chief of the Kawano Special Service Agency. On the 26th, the Public Security Bureau, fearing public outrage, sent police to protect Hezhong and escorted Takeda out of the country, handing him over to the Japanese Consulate in Zhengzhou. The Japanese side claimed this was an insult and intended to ostracize Japan. Kawano visited Yan again on the night of the 27th, verbally protesting severely, claiming that the lives and property of more than 30 Japanese residents were in danger, and threatened to send military police to protect them. Negotiations are currently underway. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Staff Officer Wachi, at 10:11 AM on the 29th, acting on behalf of Tashiro, visited Consul General Horiuchi to exchange views on the Hezhong Company matter in Taiyuan. He returned to Zhangyuan official residence at noon to report. The Japanese military and the Tianjin Consulate General have decided on a joint approach. Tashiro telegraphed Lieutenant Colonel Kawano, chief of the Taiyuan Special Service Agency, to visit Ge again and lodge a serious verbal protest. The Tianjin Consulate immediately dispatched Police Inspector Shiura with six patrol officers to Bingyuan to protect Japanese residents. The Japanese military declared that if negotiations did not yield satisfactory results, they would take self-defense measures and resolutely deal with the situation. The issue of establishing a consulate in Taiyuan, as it is not a treaty port, was proposed by the Japanese side this spring, but Yan did not approve. However, the Tianjin Consulate General has long sought to expand its consular police authority in that area but had no opportunity. A month ago, it dispatched Uetsuma, an officer from the police station, and Nakayama, a translator, to reside locally to prepare for the establishment of a police sub-station and consulate, secretly immigrating people to that area, under the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese and setting up a police presence. Recently, the Hezhong Company incident occurred, and the Suiyuan situation is about to erupt again. The military intends to restrain Yan from looking north and, in cooperation with the consulate, is making a mountain out of a molehill with this case. Wachi plans to fly to Bingyuan within days to convey the military's intentions to Kawano. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Tensions Re-emerge in Eastern Suiyuan; Wang Ying's Bandit Troops Transferred to the Rear; One Side Does Not Abandon Attempt to Invade</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Eastern Suiyuan said that there was a mutiny among Wang Ying's bandit troops stationed near Shangdu. Li Shouxin discovered this and transferred them to the rear. Currently, one side has not abandoned its attempt to invade Eastern Suiyuan and has ordered Li Shouxin and Li Jinjia to serve as vanguards, planning to invade Eastern Suiyuan. Recently, the situation on the border of Eastern Suiyuan has become tense again. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) According to Shangdu news, the new plan for the puppet bandits to invade the west has been rescheduled to be completed by the end of the year. Wang Ying's and Li Shouxin's units are the main force. Wang's unit will attack Taolin from Shangdu, with the supply station and support team located in Shangdu and Jiabusi. Li's unit will scout Xinghe from Nanhouchang and Daqinggou, west of Zhangbei, with the supply station and support team stationed in Zhangbei.

<h3>Japanese Newspaper Discusses Anglo-Japanese Cooperation; Japan Believes There is No Need to Adjust Relations Between the Two Countries; Has Prepared to Abandon the Concept of Cooperation with Britain</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Kokumin Shimbun, after careful study, the Japanese diplomatic authorities have made a final judgment on the Anglo-Japanese cooperation issue, namely, that Japan has no need to actively engage in adjusting Anglo-Japanese relations. The newspaper recalls that this issue was repeatedly raised around April of this year when Japanese Ambassador to Britain Yoshida went to London to take office. The favorable atmosphere that existed among intellectuals and governments of the two countries has had no opportunity to materialize due to the Japanese government's determination to adopt a policy of non-interference in China by other countries. The newspaper also claims that Britain has blocked the import of Japanese goods into its territory. In terms of trade, the situation between the two countries is tantamount to a state of war. However, Britain still demands that Japan provide adequate guarantees for its interests in China. Leaders of the Japanese government now realize the unfairness of this situation and are prepared to abandon the concept of cooperation with Britain. The Japanese naval authorities have also stated that even after the naval treaty is abolished, the Japanese navy will be fully capable of defending the country with its own strength.

<h3>Grain Prices Soar in Peiping; One Side Entrusts Grain Merchants to Buy Up Supplies</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Grain prices are soaring in Peiping, and the authorities are trying to suppress them. The reason is that many grain merchants in areas such as Caiyu (town name) in southern Peiping are entrusted by one side to buy up as much miscellaneous grain as possible. Dozens of trucks are transported to Langfang every day. It is rumored that people from Zhangjiakou are also buying a lot. (29th Central Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan's Trade with China Increases; Willing to Grant Us Short-Term Credit Loans; Abandoning Laissez-faire Policy and Implementing Appropriate Control</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Although Sino-Japanese negotiations are currently extremely tense, it is surprising that Japan's export trade to China has not only not decreased but has greatly increased. It is reported that China has recently placed a large number of orders with enterprises operated by major Japanese conglomerates, such as the South Manchuria Railway Company, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Nisshin. Even small and medium-sized industrial and commercial companies are overwhelmed with orders. In all aspects of the Japanese business world, activity seems to be greatly increased due to Chinese demand. It is generally believed here that the increase in the purchasing power of Chinese farmers is due to this year's bumper harvest, which has had a positive impact on the urban economy. Another important reason is the increasing demand for goods from the Chinese people, and the implementation of China's economic construction plans requires huge quantities of raw materials, some of which are supplied by Japan at low prices. The diplomatic authorities here are paying close attention to the above situation and are planning to increase economic relations with China to maintain the status quo for as long as possible. It is reported that the Japanese diplomatic authorities have prepared the following measures: (1) The Japanese government will use the British method as a blueprint and guarantee short-term credit loans to China for goods that are closely related to Japan's economic policy towards China. (2) Develop the organization of Sino-Japanese trade associations in Shanghai, Tianjin, Osaka, and other places. Prime Minister Hirota already had this plan when he was Minister of Foreign Affairs. (3) If China reduces tariffs on Japanese goods, Japan is also willing to consider reciprocal tariff issues. (4) Japan is prepared to adjust the so-called special trade in eastern Hebei within a considerable scope. (5) Regarding Japan's trade with China, implement appropriate control and abandon the laissez-faire policy that has been adopted in the past. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>American Newspaper Criticizes Japanese Military Exercises: Seemingly Military Actions with a Definite Purpose, Clearly Intending to Force China to Accept Their Demands</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Washington Post commented today on the Japanese military's exercises in Pingjin, saying that these Japanese exercises, with their broad scope and large number of participating troops, give the impression that this is not an exercise but a military action with a definite purpose. This is nothing more than Japan clearly intending to force the Chinese government to accept its demands regarding North China. This kind of exercise is merely a demonstration that if Japan's demands are rejected, its military will take action. However, the Chinese authorities absolutely cannot endlessly comply with Japan, because Chinese public opinion unanimously recognizes Japan's insatiable greed and insists that no further concessions should be made.

<h3>Japanese and Puppet Troops' "Autumn Suppression" Anti-Japanese Army's Counter-Battle News Well-Informed, Tactics Clever, Sanjiang Area Most Powerful, Future Bitter Half Year</h3>
<p>Harbin Dispatch, Since entering the summer, the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army has begun to be very active due to the growth of sorghum. Because the Japanese and puppet troops were afraid of suffering heavy sacrifices, they did not dare to attack, but could only listen to it. Since entering autumn, the sorghum has been harvested by farmers for the most part. The Japanese army believes that this is the best time to attack the Anti-Japanese Army and implement its so-called "Autumn Bandit Suppression" plan. The details of each situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Transfer and Transportation in Northeast China</p>
<p>The transfer and transportation of Japanese and puppet troops in Northeast China for the attack on the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army was completed in mid-September. From October 1st, they began to attack the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army. Since then, the Anti-Japanese Army has fought against the Japanese and puppet troops in this difficult environment until the end of March next year, actually including the three seasons of autumn (October and November), winter (December and January), and spring (February and March). Recently, the climate in Northeast China has been severely cold. The Anti-Japanese Army, running on the mountains and forests, is inadequately clothed and fed, and the wind and snow are tearing at their skin. The iron weapons held in their hands are as cold as ice, permeating their hearts. In the snow-covered mountains and under the moonlight, they are working hard to fight for the love of their motherland. Their heroic passion contains the legacy of ancient warriors. As for their willingness to endure danger and hardship, it is even more unknown to outsiders.</p>
<p>Sanjiang Anti-Japanese Army</p>
<p>The military focus of this "Autumn Bandit Suppression" by the Japanese and puppet troops is the pseudo-Sanjiang Province and the pseudo-Binjiang Province in the Fourth Military Region. The Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army in Northeast China, except for the pseudo-Andong Province and the Eastern Border Region of the pseudo-Fengtian Province in the pseudo-First Military Region, which still have active Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, the one that makes the Japanese and puppet troops most worried is the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army in the pseudo-Sanjiang Province, because its momentum is the greatest, and there are mountains stretching across several counties. They occupy the mountains and defend the danger, and there is a sense of one husband being in charge, and ten thousand troops being unable to attack. According to the information, the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army in the pseudo-Sanjiang Province region includes Xia Yunjie, Zhao Shangzhi, Dai Hongbin, Li Huatang, Xie Wendong, Wang Zibin, Tian Yuan, Yan Wang, Mingshan, Wang Yinwu, Tian Yi, Dongshanhui, Da Yimian, Zouzi, Zhanshanhao, Haihong, Yunzhonghao, Li Sihai, Wang Sihai, and various troops numbering more than 20,000 people in Luobei, Huachuan, Tangyuan, and Yilan in the north and south mountains of the Songhua River. Other famous Anti-Japanese Army leaders in Raohe, Baoqing, Boli, and other places include Cui Yishan, Li Xuefang, Lord Mengchang, Commander Guan, etc. Most of them are organized, use new tactics and new weapons in their combat methods, and have fairly detailed marching plans. They also have a political propaganda department, and their goal of propaganda to the people is to save the motherland and drive the enemies out of Northeast China. The Japanese and puppet troops feel very棘手about this kind of Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army with political colors.</p>
<p>Avoid Strength and Attack Weakness</p>
<p>The tactics adopted by the various Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army in the pseudo-Sanjiang Province region are mostly "avoiding strength and attacking weakness" in order to avoid suffering heavy sacrifices. Therefore, the various Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army are densely deployed with scouts everywhere, and the news is extremely well-informed. They rarely clash head-on with the Japanese and puppet troops. Sometimes the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army uses the tactic of luring the enemy deep, and the Japanese and puppet troops often suffer heavy losses. According to reliable news, the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army has more than 50 light machine guns and more than 20 mortars, but the clothing is very mixed and uneven. Sometimes a small team is found wearing Japanese military uniforms and copper helmets. When the Japanese and puppet troops see them, they cannot distinguish between true and false, and they are suddenly shot, which makes the attacking Japanese and puppet troops feel the difficulty of combat.</p>
<p>Leader Experience</p>
<p>Among the leaders of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, such as Zhao Shangzhi, who graduated from the Six Schools in Beiping, is clear-headed and has considerable wisdom, while Xia Yunjie is an extremely stubborn and rude Han Chinese who does not wash his face all year round. He once vowed to his subordinates that he would not wash his face until the day of success. Seeing his short stature, he has such a magical and firm idea. The Japanese and puppet troops are most afraid of these Anti-Japanese Army leaders and troops.</p>
<p>Japanese and Puppet Troop Situation</p>
<p>The Japanese and puppet troops in this "Autumn Bandit Suppression" in the Sanjiang Province region, in addition to the original troops, also transferred a certain brigade stationed in the Qiqihar area of the pseudo-Third Military Region and a large number of Japanese and puppet troops from various sources to come here to reinforce. Because their secrecy is not known to anyone, it is very difficult to know how many troops there are. They have recently begun to fight fiercely with the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army and will continue for six months. The training of these Japanese and puppet troops is presided over by Okada, a Japanese advisor in the pseudo-Sanjiang Province region. They often conduct exercises. After sending the well-trained Japanese and puppet troops to the war zone, they conduct a second batch of training. As for the soil killed by the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, they build loyalty spirit pagodas to commemorate them in order to encourage those who come to die later. Before the battle, they instill the so-called "loyalty to the emperor and defense of the country" into the soldiers to encourage them.</p>
<h3>Orders</h3>
<p>The National Government ordered on the 28th that Xiang Hanping, Xu Jingtang, Huang Renhuan, and Zhang Ruigui be appointed as lieutenant generals of the army, and Zeng Youren be appointed as major general of the army. This order also ordered that Major Generals Wang Mingzhang, Chen Li, Chen Wanren, Liao Zhen, Peng Chengfu, and Xu Shaozong be promoted to lieutenant generals of the army. This order appointed Tong Kangshi as a judge and president of the Fujian High Court. This order,</p>

<h3>An Analysis of China's Recent Finances (Part 1)</h3>
<p>-- Sun Huairen</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the currency system reform on November 4th of last year, the authorities then issued a declaration saying that after the new currency system was implemented for 18 months, China's fiscal revenue and expenditure could be balanced. The issuance of this statement clearly shows that the implementation of the new currency system is inextricably linked to the central government's finances. Therefore, people who are concerned about financial issues must not only pay attention to the changes in the financial situation itself, but also pay close attention to the dynamics of the new currency system. Here, if we take that authority's declaration as a logical major premise, then, if the new currency system is not implemented, of course China's finances cannot be balanced after 18 months, or if it is implemented and fails, China's finances cannot be balanced after 18 months either. Whether this inference is wrong depends on whether the major premise is wrong. On the other hand, since the new currency system and China's central government finances have such a close relationship, of course the situation of finances itself is also sufficient to affect the effect of the new currency system.</p>
<p>Thus, two major opposing psychologies have also arisen in people's observation of China's economic future. The first type of people highly value the new currency system, believing that after the new currency system is implemented, China's trade, China's purchasing power, and everything in China's economy will tend to be prosperous, and fiscal revenue and expenditure will naturally be balanced. This type of people can be given a name and called the "optimistic faction of the new currency system." The second type of people, on the contrary, attach importance to the unsoundness of China's finances, believing that before improving the current financial essence, revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, and that what the new currency system can do to balance finances only lies in the possibility of inflation. Therefore, this faction is the "pessimistic faction of the new currency system." Those who are optimistic about the new currency system are obviously also optimistic about China's finances; similarly, those who are pessimistic about the new currency system are of course also pessimistic about China's finances.</p>
<p>It has been almost twelve months since the currency reform, and there is only half a year left before the 18-month deadline in the declaration. In the past two-thirds of the appointment period, although we have not seen inflation on the surface, we have not seen any obvious improvement in the central government's finances either. On September 6th, Finance Minister Kong once talked to reporters about the recent situation of the central government's finances. It is said that the fiscal deficit in the past year reached 200 million yuan. Fortunately, we adhered to the principle of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, and made every effort to maintain it, and reorganized tax collection and saved various expenses, so that we could safely get through the difficulties. In the current year, with the unification of Guangdong and Guangxi, the national credit has become more consolidated, and with the bumper harvest of agricultural products, smuggling has been suppressed, financial stability, and the start of income tax collection, the central government's finances will definitely tend to balance with a little time. (See September 7th Current Affairs News) This conversation clearly revealed that the future of the central government's finances seems very promising. As a result, the general optimists feel that their theory is a manifestation of the facts. However, the previous reports of improved finances are still only verbal hearsay. Therefore, whether China's finances have improved or deteriorated cannot but depend on the facts in the next six months of the appointment period to explain. However, everything among human beings is governed by the law of cause and effect. Although we cannot make a definite assertion about future facts like a prophet, we can more or less infer some things from the past cause. Whether the inference is wrong or not depends on the future facts to compare.</p>
<p>Here, we will begin to infer the future of China's finances and review the two different theories about China's finances.</p>
<p>Speaking of the most obvious crisis in China's finances in recent years, everyone will point out the phenomenon of unbalanced revenue and expenditure. According to the government's publicly announced figures, since 1928, the annual revenue shortfall has often been around 100 million yuan. Among the years with final accounts (from 1928 to 1934), the largest deficit was 147 million yuan in 1933, accounting for 19.2% of the expenditure. Although there are no official final account figures for the two years after 1934 and 1935, the shortfall is still over 100 million yuan. Although this kind of financial imbalance is a modern, worldwide epidemic, it seems unremarkable, but for China's poor and weak national economy, its severity cannot be compared with other countries. In the past decade, the annual deficit of more than 100 million yuan has been almost entirely made up for by public debt policies. This public debt policy, until the forced exchange of unified public debt in February of this year, has felt that its future hope has been reduced. (According to the facts, since July 1935, the monthly fund for the repayment of domestic debt has been less than 4 million yuan.) Taking a step back, even if the public debt policy still has digestive power in today's China, but that year-after-year imbalance will eventually hit a wall. Therefore, at present, everyone feels that the adjustment of China's finances should start with balancing revenue and expenditure first, so at the time of the currency system reform last year, the statement that revenue and expenditure could be balanced after 18 months was put forward, so that everyone could have a strong sympathy for the currency system reform.</p>
<p>Whether China's finances can really be balanced after 18 months of currency system reform, as I have said before, is still difficult to say, but judging from the current financial situation, the practice of this statement is by no means an easy task. The year 1935 has now passed, and we will not worry about it for the time being. If we study the budget for the fiscal year 1936, which began on July 1, we find that it is not only unbalanced in revenue and expenditure, but even its unbalanced figure has appeared a new record high. The total revenue and expenditure for the fiscal year 1936 were 990.7 million yuan (this is the highest amount since China has had a budget). Although it maintains a balance on the surface, in fact, if we carefully examine the content of the revenue, we know that more than 200 million yuan of this is borrowed money and fictitious income. We can list the non-tax revenue in the budget for the past two years as a decision table. (Unit: 1,000 yuan)</p>
<p>From this table, we can see how rapidly the non-tax revenue in China's finances has been advancing in recent years, but this figure is unbelievable. The easiest to see is the item of net profit of state-owned enterprises, which has actually increased from 8 million yuan to more than 40 million yuan in a very short period of one or two years (more than 5 times), which contains some exaggeration. (See later for details) In addition, like the two items of state-owned property income and miscellaneous revenue and expenditure, the figures for the fiscal year 1935 increased compared with the fiscal year 1934, but the figures for the fiscal year 1936 have decreased compared with the fiscal year 1935, which precisely indicates that too much was falsely listed in the past, and now we have to reduce it a little. On the whole, the non-tax revenues for the fiscal year 1936 are less than those for the previous year, but the total amount has increased by 40 million yuan compared with the previous year, which is because the item of loan revenue has increased by 55 million yuan. According to a certain statistic, the deficit of the central government's finances in the past year reached 170 million yuan. Then, we can infer that the deficit for the fiscal year 1936 should be more than 220 million yuan. (According to the report of Legislative Committee member Chen Changheng, the deficit is about 200 million yuan.) Those who are looking forward to the balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure in six months (18 months) may feel disappointed when they see such a large deficit that has never been seen before.</p>

<h3>The Significance of the US Presidential Election</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>The US presidential election will be held on the 4th of next month. For several days, the election campaign has reached a fever pitch. The Republican and Democratic parties are evenly matched. The outcome depends on the effectiveness of the propaganda in these few remaining days. According to Reuters, Roosevelt has gained an advantage in thirty-two states and could get 70% of the electoral votes. Landon (the Republican presidential candidate) has a slight victory in sixteen states and could get 30% of the electoral votes. However, according to the test of the New York literary and artistic weekly, the result is the opposite. Landon can win the advantage of thirty-two states, while Roosevelt has the hope of winning only sixteen states. The ratio of voting power is 370 to 161, which is a big difference. It is because in this election, there are quite a lot of voters in a state of hesitation. Larger states such as New York are admittedly undecided. However, unless there are special changes, Roosevelt's chances of winning seem to be greater than Landon's.</p>
<p>This election is of great significance. The impact of who wins or loses is not limited to the personal gains and losses of Roosevelt or Landon. As far as the future of the US national economy is concerned, Roosevelt advocates reform, with the state controlling the nation's economic activities, so that capitalism does not fall into anarchy and self-destruction. Landon advocates conservatism, wanting to restore the state before 1933, advocating individualism and free competition, and regarding state intervention in private economic activities as the beginning of dictatorship and autocracy. He also wants to balance the budget and reduce relief expenses. Therefore, if Landon wins, the United States will return to the old economic anarchy. Laborers, poor farmers, and the unemployed will inevitably feel pain. This is one aspect. In terms of the political future of the United States, Roosevelt advocates centralization, advocating the expansion of the powers granted to the federal government by the constitution, to meet the requirements of the times. If there are difficulties, he will not hesitate to amend the constitution and reduce the power of the Supreme Court. Landon advocates protecting the freedom of the people and the power of the states, and regards the constitution and the Supreme Court as sacred and inviolable. If he wins, the political institutions of the United States will not be able to cope with the current social and economic demands. This is the second aspect.</p>
<p>In terms of diplomacy, although both advocate a policy of international isolation and vigorously promote the maintenance of peace, their attitudes are quite different. Roosevelt said that arms merchants are the creators of war. To achieve neutrality, we must first guard against the profiteering of international bankers and international arms dealers. He also deeply feels that the increase in economic barriers is the cause of ill will between countries. To achieve peace, we must engage in negotiating reciprocal tariff treaties and seek international amity through economic cooperation. Therefore, Roosevelt's attitude is self-critical and constructive. Landon is not like that. He vigorously opposes the League of Nations and the World Court, advocates expanding the army, navy, and air force, avoiding cooperation with other countries, canceling reciprocal tariff agreements, and wants to recover war debts and urge other countries to disarm. His attitude is accusatory and passive. In the days when Roosevelt is in power, the League of Nations and peace-loving countries still have the possibility of working hand in hand with Washington. If Landon is elected, narrow nationalism will dominate Washington's foreign policy, and the hope of international cooperation will be even more remote.</p>
<p>Now, in Europe and the Far East, the terror of war has reached its peak. Whether the destruction of human civilization can be postponed to after 1936 is quite a question. The war in Spain has put the Soviet Union and Germany and Italy in a state of enemies. Japan's active actions against China put the peace in the Far East in a precarious situation. The United States is the world's largest peaceful force, and its national destiny is closely related to the peace in any corner of the world. Recently, the direct Pacific air route between China and the United States has been opened, and Mr. He Huai De, a leader of the press in that country, has also come eastward on the wind. It can be seen that the relationship between the Far East and the United States is becoming increasingly close. We should pay close attention to the change of the US head of state, and the people of that country should have a deeper understanding of the internal and external relations of China and other countries in the world. Empty talk of isolation and avoiding cooperation may not be the best plan. On the eve of the US general election, we wish the people of that country to have a realistic consideration.</p>
<h3>Japanese Financial Circles Mobilize to Donate Money for Military Expenses; Totaling 165 Million, Contributed in Three Years to Implement National Policy</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese financial circles now have a plan to unite and donate 165 million yuan to the country's national defense fund. This plan was initially carried out by influential figures in Taiwan's financial circles to raise 15 million yuan. Later, central financial figures had a plan of 150 million yuan, intending to mobilize powerful capitalists across the country. Large financial groups such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo also participated in the large-scale national defense donation campaign. It is heard that the specific method is to set up a National Defense Association to handle this matter, donating 55 million yuan to each of the Army and Navy, to be paid in three years. According to Akatsuka Hatsutaro, president of Showa Sugar Company, recently, the military and political circles have been actively campaigning with the slogan of purging the military and reforming administrative affairs. The financial circles must also be united to cope with the extraordinary situation, hence this move. (29th, Allied Press)</p>
<h3>Germany Has No Intention of Recognizing Manchukuo; Disappointed with Trade Situation; Exports to Manchuria Decreased Instead</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Reuters learned from diplomatic circles here today that Germany feels that "Manchukuo's" attitude towards German exports is very disappointing, believing that "Manchukuo" has failed to fulfill the trade agreement it signed with Germany. Therefore, Germany is unwilling to recognize "Manchukuo" in the near future. According to statistics, the goods purchased by Germany from "Manchukuo" last year increased by 80%, while "Manchukuo's" imports of German goods were 20% lower than last year. (28th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Member States Withdrawing; Regarding Mandated Territories</h3>

<p>(Geneva) At today's meeting of the League of Nations Mandates Commission, French representatives Le Bige and Xiang Song both declared that the French government believes that League of Nations member states that have withdrawn, such as Japan, Germany, and Brazil, should not enjoy the same economic treatment as the member states in the mandated territories. The United States, because of a special treaty, should still enjoy the same rights and should be treated as an exception. (According to reports, France has recently reduced import tariffs, but has not yet implemented them in the mandated territories.) (28th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Related to the Far East; Twenty-one Countries; France Advocates Close Cooperation</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Pacific Problems Research Association held a meeting this morning. The chairman, former Prime Minister Sarraut (i.e., the chief French representative of the last Pacific Society), delivered a speech, stating that there are as many as eleven countries in the world related to the Far East. It is hoped that France can cooperate closely with them to establish a regional security pact and enhance it. Because international disputes, even if they occur in one corner of the world, their impact will eventually affect the whole world. This is why the collective security system should be promoted in all parts of the world. Sarraut then recounted the proceedings of the last Pacific Society meeting held in the United States at Semito City, and reported on the development of various forms of Japan in the Far East, the industrial progress of the Soviet Union in Siberia, the construction situation in China, and the new policy of the United States towards the Far East.

<h3>Japanese Naval Maneuvers End; Naval Review Held Yesterday</h3>

<h3>50th Anniversary of the Completion of the Statue of Liberty in the United States; Grand Celebrations in New York; US and French Flags Shine Together; Aircraft Soar in the Sky and Warships Fire Salutes</h3>
<p>Roosevelt Reaffirms the Concept of Freedom and Peace</p>
<p>(New York) The Statue of Liberty on Bedloe's Island in New York Harbor was made by several famous French sculptors and is one of the great buildings in the United States. Since its unveiling on October 28, 1886, today marks its 50th anniversary. The US government held a celebration ceremony, and the scene was extremely grand. The statue itself is extremely magnificent (89 feet high, with a base area of 62 square feet and weighing 225 tons). Now decorated with the national flags of the United States and France, it is even more magnificent. Countless people gathered around the statue, and three warships and countless cruise ships were anchored in the harbor, all flying flags and streamers, traveling back and forth, adding to the joyful atmosphere. When President Roosevelt arrived on a ferry, the warships immediately fired a 21-gun salute, and a squadron of aircraft soared in the sky. Suddenly, naval warships and merchant ships, aircraft and seaplanes in the air, all paraded in front of President Roosevelt, Mayor LaGuardia of New York City, the French government representative, namely Tedson, Assistant to the French State Council, the French Ambassador to the United States, De La Perre, and the US Secretary of the Interior, Ikes. All the dignitaries made speeches. President Roosevelt's speech said, "Those who presented the statue earlier had the same desire as our country, that is, freedom and peace are one. My belief is nothing else, that modern civilization will be improved." At the same time, French President Lebrun also delivered a broadcast speech from Paris to the United States, stating that the friendship between France and the United States has the power to last forever, and can be seen at this grand event. "Freedom is the main condition for progress, it was so in the past, and it is still so today," he said. (28th, Havas)</p>
<h3>US General Election; Date Approaching</h3>
<p>Voter Registration Breaks Records</p>
<p>(New York) The date of the US presidential election is less than a week away, so the presidential candidates of all parties are making every effort to win the final victory. Roosevelt and Landon both arrived in New York at the same time after traveling across the country. President Luo had taken a short rest in Washington to prepare for his final speech, so he did not look dusty. When he arrived in New York, the welcoming crowd was very crowded. Mr. Landon arrived in New York after Mr. Luo, and the grand welcome was the same. When Luo and Lan entered the city of New York, the New York police authorities dispatched about 3,000 policemen to guard the route. The first thing President Luo did after arriving in New York was to preside over the 50th anniversary celebration of the founding of the Statue of Liberty and give a speech, saying, "Even in the turbulent times at the moment, I still believe that a better civilization than we have known will appear in America, or it may be extended to the world." Roosevelt also said that this Statue of Liberty, in addition to symbolizing freedom, should be promoted and broadened to make it a symbol of peace. At the same time, people across the country have speculated a lot about the results of the general election next Tuesday. The US Postmaster and Roosevelt's campaign manager, Mr. Fa Lei, predicted that Luo would win an absolute victory. At the same time, Republican Chairman Hamilton also believed that Landon would defeat Roosevelt. The current number of registered voters across the country has reached 55,427,000, an increase of 15,000,000 from 1932, breaking the previous record. (28th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Singapore Naval Base; Wartime Status</h3>
<p>British Press Giants Point Out Weaknesses</p>
<p>Singapore Lord Rothermere, a giant of the London press, returned home after inspecting the Far East and made a speech to the press today, saying that the weaknesses of the Singapore naval base will definitely make the British government feel very uneasy. If the British government does not resolutely decide to build a naval and air force fortress as solid as Honolulu or Vladivostok, then the money spent in the past will be equal to throwing it into a void. This kind of fortress should at least have 30 or 40 submarines, an army of 10,000 people, and 25 or 30 squadrons of aircraft stationed there. British policy is uncertain, and the Singapore naval base is one example. Originally, it was intended to make it a British fortress in the Far East, but now it is of no value for large-scale wars.

<h3>China, Britain and the US Three Lines Meet; Hong Kong Becomes the Far East Aviation Center</h3>
<p>(London) At present, there are three airlines planning to meet in Hong Kong. It is feared that the area will soon become the largest intersection of commercial aviation lines in the Far East. According to news from this agency, arrangements have now been made so that Pan American Airlines flying boats can come to Hong Kong via Manila, and China Aviation Corporation aircraft can fly to Hong Kong instead of flying to Macau. It is heard that the above arrangements will be implemented soon. Hong Kong is the Far East terminus of the British Imperial Aviation Line. As for the trans-Pacific air route, the matter of Hong Kong being its terminus has been negotiated before, and it has been suspended many times, but it has now been resolved smoothly. It is decided that the "Philippine Clipper" will still use Macau as its terminus, but when the next flight comes, it will be changed to Hong Kong. (29th, Reuters)</p>

<h3>The Non-Intervention Committee; No Results in the Dispute; Soviet Russia's Attitude Remains Unclear; Britain, Germany, and Italy Favor Portugal and Suppress Russia</h3>
<p>(London) Fearing that the governments of Soviet Russia and Portugal would not attend the Adjustment Committee on Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War, the representatives of the two countries still attended the meeting today, which lasted for six hours, focusing on considering Soviet Russia's accusations against Portugal for violating the non-intervention agreement, and Portugal's counter-accusations against Soviet Russia for interfering in Spanish affairs and promoting the civil war in the country. Soviet Russia mentioned a letter of explanation in response to recent Portuguese counter-accusations, saying that Soviet Russia was prepared to discuss the suggestions put forward by Committee Chairman Woon Lai Mao Zi to control the ports of the two countries and the Spanish border, and that if the legitimate government of Spain agreed, Soviet Russia would not oppose the implementation of control in the Spanish seaports and border areas not occupied by the rebel army. Soviet Russia asked the committee to immediately begin discussing this proposal.</p>
<p>The Portuguese representative did not accept the Soviet Russian proposal to control Portuguese ports. Chairman Pride Mouth explained that the British government was only concerned about suggestions to prevent the Spanish war from becoming an international war. Italian representative Grandi pointed out that Soviet Russia's remarks were ambiguous, saying that Soviet Russia's attitude really shocked the newspapers and encouraged one side of the war to prolong the war. Then Soviet Russian representative Mesky rose and said that Soviet Russia really wanted to combine the suggestion to control Portuguese ports with the suggestion put forward by Pride Mouth later to control Spanish ports and coastal areas. The Portuguese representative also accused Soviet Russia of being erratic, saying that it was difficult to discuss Portugal's accusations before the Soviet Russian representative. He regarded the ambassador's attendance as sufficient to indicate that Soviet Russia was still bound by the non-intervention agreement. Then Grandi, representing the Italian government, firmly denied the accusations against Italy. The Soviet Russian representative replied that the Italian statement was as unsatisfactory as the German reply. Mr. Mei also said that the Italian government continued to violate the non-intervention agreement in Spain and Mada. Then the chairman officially said that after a thorough investigation of the accusations against Italy, it was known that there was no real evidence. The accusations either occurred before Italy joined the agreement or never occurred. French representative Corban stated that the French government supports the entire non-intervention agreement and intends to make every effort to make the agreement effective. The French government is prepared to study any practical plan to control seaports and intends to participate in any plan that other governments have agreed to. Then the chairman stated that Soviet Russia's position was still unclear and asked whether Soviet Russia was still bound by the non-intervention agreement or had withdrawn from the obligations of the non-intervention agreement. Wei Nai announced that the subcommittee would reconvene on November 2, and the General Committee would convene on November 4. (28th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>The Truth About Italian-German Talks; Seeking to Win Over Britain; Hope for Compromise on the Locarno Issue</h3>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the results of Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Germany, there is much speculation from the outside world, or that Italy will "distance itself" from the League of Nations. This is the news carried by Italian newspapers, or that Italy will be separated from Britain, or even that Ciano's trip was intended to instigate Germany to agree with Italy and unanimously oppose Britain. A reporter from this agency recently declared that the former statement has been confirmed, and the latter statement is not credible. According to reliable sources in diplomatic circles here, Germany now wants to be close to Britain. It is generally believed here that this is an extension of the joint Italian-German front. Therefore, the rumors from the outside world that Italy and the government must require Britain to first explain its policies in the Mediterranean before proceeding with talks with it have become a non-issue. This can be seen from the fact that the Italian newspapers were detained by the government for any content that was unfavorable to Britain when Count Ciano visited Berlin a few days ago. In addition, when General Miller, director of the German Aviation Department, visited Rome a few days ago, he was heard to have proposed a Locarno Pact in the sky to General Valey, director of the Italian Aviation Department, and asked Britain to participate together (France will wait for Britain to participate before inviting it to join). This is also enough to prove that Italy wants to be close to Britain. As for the negotiations between Britain and Italy on the issue of convening a Locarno Conference, which have been delayed for a long time, there is now hope for a compromise. (29th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Belgian Foreign Minister Announces; Not Wanting Neutrality; But Seeking Not to Be Drawn into the Vortex</h3>
<p>Beijing Foreign Minister Spark stated when answering questions in the House of Representatives today that Belgium does not want to maintain neutrality, but is still willing to be a member of the League of Nations. Mr. Shi also firmly stated that Belgium's obligations will not be undermined by the King of Belgium's speech, but Belgium feels that its national security cannot be obtained solely through collective security and mutual assistance. Belgium will never allow foreign troops to pass through Belgian territory or occupy Belgian territory to invade other countries. Belgium's policy is based on the desire for independence of this country and seeks to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war. (28th, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Romania and Czechoslovakia Decide to Cooperate with Germany and Italy to Resolve Central European Issues; Romania's Neutrality Movement Expands</h3>
<p>Prague, Czechoslovakia – King Carol II of Romania arrived here this morning and met with Czech Prime Minister Hodza. Foreign Minister Crovda then visited President Beneš. King Carol, Foreign Minister Antonescu, President Beneš, and Foreign Minister Crovda held a meeting to discuss the international situation. Afterward, a communiqué was issued stating that the Romanian and Czech authorities had reached a consensus. It also stated that the Little Entente countries are willing to sincerely cooperate with the signatories of the Rome Protocols (Italy, Austria, and Hungary) and Germany on various European issues. Furthermore, the resolution adopted at the recent standing political conference of the Little Entente countries held in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, namely "The Little Entente countries do not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, but other countries must not interfere in the internal affairs of the Little Entente countries," is hereby reaffirmed and will be implemented. President Beneš hosted a banquet in the evening to welcome the Romanian King. During the banquet, the leaders of both countries delivered speeches emphasizing the unity of the Little Entente countries, which remains unchanged from the past. (Havas News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania – A movement advocating a neutral policy has recently emerged in the country and is gaining momentum. Its arguments are based on two points: (1) collective security mechanisms have failed, and (2) the public harbors antipathy towards the Soviet Union. It is also argued that a conflict between Russia and Germany is likely, and if Romania does not wish to be drawn into the vortex, it must unite the Baltic states, the Little Entente countries, the Balkan Entente countries, and Poland to form a strong neutral bloc to maintain armed neutrality. This movement is led by Brătianu, a leader of the Liberal Party's splinter faction, and is supported by the extreme right and a portion of the right wing. However, the majority of the Liberal Party members, the Peasants' Party, and the Conservative Party have expressed opposition. They believe that this is an attempt by Germany to exploit the Little Entente countries' interconnected relationships to undermine the mutual assistance pact between Russia and Czechoslovakia. These individuals have expressed their delight at King Carol II's visit to Czechoslovakia, believing that the outcome of this trip will ensure that Romania's alliance system within the framework of the League of Nations will be fully maintained.

<h3>French Finance Minister Explains New Budget</h3>
<p>Deficit of Six Billion Francs; Plans to Find New Ways to Restore Balance</p>
<p>(Paris) French Finance Minister Olivol appeared before the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon to explain the main points of the 1937 budget. The budget is scheduled to be submitted to the Chamber of Deputies for discussion at the end of next month. Olivol first discussed the financial situation in 1936, stating that despite the government's efforts to economize, the actual financial deficit reached a staggering 6,000,000,000 francs due to various unexpected expenditures. The total expenditure for this year is approximately 50,000,000,000 francs, which is not much different from that of 1933. As long as the international situation does not ease and financial market interest rates do not decrease, expenditure on national defense and debt will not be reduced. Previous governments sought to make up for the financial deficit by reducing public works, saving wages and salaries, and increasing taxes. The current government plans to find new ways to restore budget balance. (Havas News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the Finance Minister explained the content of the new budget to the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies yesterday, it has been learned that the temporary expenditure section of the budget includes 8,500,000,000 francs for national defense and 3,500,000,000 francs for public works, totaling 12,000,000,000 francs. These will be financed by issuing special government bonds. Added to the regular expenditure of 47,000,000,000 francs, the total amounts to 59,000,000,000 francs. Regarding revenue, in addition to reducing various indirect taxes and increasing income taxes, the tax rate on large inheritances will also be increased, while the tax rate on small inheritances will be reduced. Furthermore, the government plans to improve various public utilities to simplify them and save expenses. (Havas News Agency, 29th)</p>

<h3>Funeral of Hu Hanmin: Central Representative Sun Ke Presided Over the Solemn Ceremony; Over 120,000 People from Chinese and Foreign Circles Attended</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The remains of the late Standing Committee Member and Chairman of the Fifth Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, Hu Hanmin, were given a state funeral in Guangdong on the 25th of this month. In advance, central officials, representatives from various provinces, and representatives from overseas party branches arrived in Guangzhou to participate in the ceremony. The Office of the State Funeral of Chairman Hu also made advance preparations for all state funeral matters. The cemetery was solemnly decorated, and the ceremonies on the day of the state funeral were orderly and well-organized. Details are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Cemetery Scene</p>
<p>Hu's cemetery is located on Lion Mountain in Douwenlang, Longyandong, in Panyu County, a suburb of Guangzhou. The cemetery and the avenue leading to the tomb were completed several months ago. Two large temporary sheds were erected in front of the tomb to serve as the venue for the state funeral ceremony. Potted flowers were displayed on both sides of the avenue, and triangular flags of alternating black and white colors were planted. At the entrance to the avenue, there was a plain archway over ten feet high, with the four characters "精神不死" ("Spirit Never Dies") written on it. Further in, there were two more archways, one with the inscription "天下楷模" ("Model for the World") and the other with "薄海同悲" ("All Seas Mourn"), both grand in appearance. At the end of the archways, there were three halls. The central hall served as a reception area for various organizations and groups. The halls on the left and right served as rest areas for overseas party representatives and school representatives. Condolence banners and eulogies were hung all around, from high-ranking officials of the central government to relatives and old friends, all sending condolences in black characters on white cloth. Next to the reception area were the military police stations and officers' rest areas. Entering from the reception area was the memorial hall. Above the hall was a plaque with the inscription "胡主席國葬典禮" ("State Funeral Ceremony of Chairman Hu") written horizontally. The interior of the hall was decorated with black and white cloth balls and condolence banners. In the center was a portrait of Chairman Hu, with the party and national emblem hanging behind it. In front of the portrait was a long table with offerings and flowers, as well as a giant bronze tripod engraved with the characters "不匱" ("Inexhaustible"), a gift from Wang Longzhai.</p>
<p>State Funeral Ceremony</p>
<p>Central officials paying respects to Hu (photographed by Zhen Jing)</p>
<p>The day before, people from all walks of life went to the State Funeral Office to receive attendance certificates, bus tickets, and Hu commemorative items, including a porcelain statue of Chairman Hu, a collection of poems from the Inexhaustible Room, and a commemorative badge. Those who came to pay respects from private groups or organizations received bus tickets. Therefore, on the 25th, at dawn, those attending the ceremony went in an endless stream. The Panyu Highway was crowded with plain cars and white horses. Before 8 a.m., there were no empty seats at the reception. Soon, central representatives and representatives from various provinces arrived one after another, including Chairman Lin Sen of the Central Government, Sun Ke (acting on behalf), central representatives Lin Yunhai, Wang Chonghui, Li Wenfan, Shao Yuanchong, Jiao Yitang, Liu Guanxun, Zhu Hezhong, Fu Bingchang, Chen Lifu, Liang Hancao, representatives from various ministries and departments Shi Ying, Zheng Hongnian, Huang Musong, Xie Wuliang, Wang Yongbin, Zhang Yuanyou, Liu Weichi, Yun Yingqiao, Luo Gang, Xiong Mengbin representing Feng Yuxiang, Li Hongwen representing Yan Xishan, Zhang Renmin and Li Renren representing Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi of Guangxi, Guangdong Pacification Director Yu Hanmou, as well as Guangdong department heads, senior officers from the Fourth Route Army, representatives from party branches in various provinces and cities, representatives from overseas party branches, representatives from various people's organizations, representatives from various schools, foreign guests including consuls (or representatives of their respective ambassadors) from Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Portugal, Finland, Denmark, Czech Republic, etc. stationed in Guangdong, and people from all walks of life who voluntarily participated, numbering no less than 120,000. At noon, the ceremony began. The first row in the center of the hall was the seating for the central presiding officials, the first row on the left side was the seating for central committee members, government members, and central representatives, the second row was the seating for heads of various ministries and departments, the third row was the seating for representatives from overseas party branches and consuls from various countries, the first row on the right side was the seating for ambassadors or representatives from various countries, the second row was the seating for party, government, and military heads and committee members from various provinces and cities, and the third row was the seating for members of the State Funeral Office. Following that were the seating for representatives from various organizations, groups, and schools. After taking their places, incense and candles were lit in front of the hall. The scene was solemn, with the smoke of incense curling upward. Central Representative Sun Ke presided over the ceremony, and mourning music was played. After the music stopped, the presiding officials offered flowers and respectfully read the eulogy from the central government and the government of each province, as well as eulogies from various parties (read by Zhu Shouyu, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Government). After the reading, the music began again, and the entire assembly bowed three times to the portrait of the deceased. After the bowing, there was three minutes of silence. Then, the ceremony of adding soil was held. Led by Sun Ke, central officials Lin Yunhai, Shao Yuanchong, Li Wenfan, etc. proceeded to the side of Hu's tomb, took a handful of soil, and scattered it in front of the grave. After the sealing of the tomb, they returned to their original positions and bowed three times to the portrait of the deceased. At this time, Hu's widow, Chen Shuzi, and daughter, Hu Mulan, wept loudly in the mourning curtain. Many of those who attended were moved to tears. The crowd then withdrew amid the final mourning music. At this time, people from all walks of life who came to pay their respects freely were coming and going in an endless stream, which did not end until 2 p.m.</p>
<p>City Mourning</p>
<p>Chairman Hu's cemetery (photographed by Zhen Jingyan)</p>
<p>During the moment of silence at the state funeral ceremony, all the lights in the city were turned on, factories sounded their sirens, and citizens all stood silently for three minutes. At the same time, the Humen Fort fired 101 gun salutes to express mourning. All shops, government offices, and schools flew flags at half-mast. Theaters, cinemas, and entertainment venues were closed for the day, and music was suspended to express mourning. In addition, two unfortunate incidents occurred on this day. One was that Luo Peizhi, a veteran revolutionary party member, committed suicide by slitting his throat with a knife at the public memorial venue. Luo was a member of the Overseas Comrades Society and a native of Panyu County, Guangdong. In his early years, he was a businessman in Longjibao, Nanyang, and was friendly with Yun Lie and others. He followed Sun Yat-sen to engage in the revolution. Later, he returned to China after his business failed. He repeatedly decided to start an uprising in China. He was upright and did not seek power or influence. After the success of the revolution, he still earned his own living. In his later years, his family was impoverished and lacked assistance. He became increasingly frustrated. Fellow comrades in Guangdong occasionally provided assistance, but after Hu Hanmin's death, the assistance from all parties was cut off. Luo had no way to support himself. On this day, after paying respects to Hu, he felt emotional about his own life and committed suicide with a knife in front of the cemetery. Fortunately, he was rescued and sent to the hospital for treatment. His life was not in danger. This is one incident. On the same day, a group of about 20 people who came to pay their respects to Hu took public bus No. 7024 to Lion Mountain. While passing in front of the Yantang Military Academy, due to the jostling of the crowd, the driver was momentarily careless, and the entire bus fell into a pool of water. Three women surnamed Zhang and Liang and a man surnamed Huang were seriously injured. It was reported that they were representatives of a certain labor union. Six or seven others were slightly injured. After receiving medical treatment, most of them recovered. This is another incident. (October 26th)</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province: New Long-Distance Telephone Facilities; Installation of Carrier Telephony and Addition of Amplifiers</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Dispatch: The construction of long-distance telephones in our country's provinces began earliest in Zhejiang Province, and the density of the Qian lines and the completion of the telephone communication network have also become the crown of various provinces. This is due to the careful planning and efforts of the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Authorities and those in charge over the years. I recently heard that although there are several pairs of direct lines between Hangzhou and Yongjia, and between Hangzhou and Yin County, the telephone traffic is congested, and the original Qian lines are no longer sufficient. In order to remedy this, after planning everything, the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department approved the purchase of carrier equipment from the German Siemens factory, to be installed in Hangzhou, Yongjia, and Yin County respectively. After installation, with the help of carrier action, one pair of telephone lines can have the communication function of two pairs of telephone lines, and it can be expanded in the future. The cost of this equipment is more than twice as much as adding lines. In order to improve the efficiency of inter-provincial calls, the bureau also decided to install long-distance amplifiers in Hangzhou, Lanxi, Yongjia, Ningbo, and other four places to make the sound transmission of calls clear and loud everywhere. The two amplifiers in Hangzhou have already been installed and are working perfectly. It is now known that the bureau is also installing a 22-type amplifier each in Lanxi and Yongjia. The machine has also been ordered from the German Siemens factory, and it will soon be shipped to Hangzhou for installation and standby. After that, the communication in Zhejiang Province will be more smooth than before. According to the carrier telephone equipment, the cost is low and the efficiency is high. Many European and American countries have adopted it. It is still a new idea in China. This move by the bureau has created a new record in China's telecommunications facilities. In the future, as the telephone business develops in various provinces, this facility will inevitably be imitated and adopted by the construction authorities of various provinces.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Machine Presentation Representative Goes to Beijing</h3>
<p>The 31st is the 50th birthday of Chairman Chiang. The agencies and groups of the province raised funds to purchase a plane to present to the government, and held a presentation ceremony on that day. All counties sent representatives to participate in the grand ceremony. Our county has appointed Cheng Weiru and Lu Shulian as representatives of our county, and they went to Beijing yesterday.</p>
<h3>Water Patrol Team Arrests Notorious Bandit</h3>
<p>The water patrol team was ordered to go on patrol. The team leader Fei Gongxia led the patrol boat to tour Punan a few days ago. It was reported that Yang Ayuan, the former member of the already executed bandit leader Li Jinxiang, has recently been hiding in Shanyang. The team immediately led the team to arrest him and found a lotus pistol and more than 30 rounds of box gun ammunition in his home. He was brought back to the team headquarters for interrogation yesterday. The suspect confessed that he was 26 years old and from Pankushiang in the eighth district. He has committed many robberies in Punan. However, the suspect has many accomplices, and they are currently being pursued in order to eliminate the banditry.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Teacher-Student Love Suicide Case</h3>
<p>Chen Tianyi, 35, from Wujiang, is the nephew of the late Chen Qubing. He used to be a teacher at Jiangsu Provincial Women's Vocational School in Suzhou. He had a teacher-student relationship with female student Wang Yifen. After the incident, Chen resigned due to the incident, and the woman also dropped out of school. Later, Chen took a job as a teacher at Shanghai Huinan Middle School in Shanghai and lured the woman to Shanghai to study at the school. After Wang's father, Zai Bohua, reported the matter to the Shanghai authorities, the school dismissed Chen and Wang. They temporarily stayed at the Yuanyuan Hotel on Second Avenue in Shanghai. Later, Wang Yifen realized Chen's deception and returned to Suzhou on the 6:15 pm train from Shanghai on the 28th. Chen also tracked down to Suzhou on the same train. Because Chen did not purchase a ticket, the ticket inspector discovered him. At this time, Wang Yifen said that she did not know Chen Tianyi, so the train inspector felt even more suspicious and was questioning them separately. Near Anting, Wang Yifen suddenly jumped off the train and attempted suicide. She survived, and then jumped into a pond next to the road. The train stopped and the train inspector got off the train and entered the pond to rescue her. She was brought to Suzhou and sent to the Gospel Hospital for treatment. She only suffered a slight head injury and was not in danger of life. Chen Tianyi was sent to the police station and transferred to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Impersonates Civil Servant</h3>
<p>Lawyer Qian Jiazhen was accused of obstructing order by impersonating a bailiff to seal up a house while handling a case of inheritance of temple property for Taoist Mao Zhongqing and Yin Fuyuan. The local court has sentenced him to a fine of 100 yuan. Qian refused to accept the verdict and prepared to appeal to the High Court.</p>
<h3>Kunshan: Rural Gambling Resurges</h3>
<p>Gambling has always been rampant in the county. County Magistrate Peng Baichuan strictly banned rural teahouses as soon as he took office, hoping to curb gambling. Recently, when the new grain was on the market, some local ruffians took the opportunity to sneak into the countryside to lure farmers to gamble in order to reap profits. In recent days, they have been discovered in various villages in the fourth district. Farmers are willing to bet all their hard-earned money. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to strict prohibition.</p>
<h3>Prolonged Drought</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn, there has been no rain in the county for more than two months. The fields are cracked, and all the villages are suffering from drought. The rice stem borers are active, and the late rice harvest is bound to be greatly reduced. Winter crops cannot be planted, and farmers are worried.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Appeals for Explanation of Cocoon Prices</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Cocoon Industry Association, the Wuxi Cocoon Trade Association, and the Silk Factory Association suffered heavy losses due to the two different autumn cocoon prices set by the previous improvement association. They sent a telegram to the Construction Department to appeal and express the plight of the silk and cocoon industry. They subsequently received instructions from the department, but the doubts were not fully resolved. Yesterday, they submitted another report to the department, requesting an explanation on three points: (1) The two different autumn cocoon prices this year are due to the government's abnormal orders and merchants' huge losses. Does the three-grade standard cocoon price set by the National Economic Council's Silk Improvement Committee have the power to bind Jiangsu? Is Jiangsu within the scope of the country? (2) The Cocoon Leaf Improvement Management Committee stipulated that the cocoon price must not be lower than 29 yuan. However, the products have their own prices. High-quality goods are reeled at 400 catties, and defective goods are reeled at 500 catties. The minimum price must not be less than 29 yuan, that is, defective cocoons should also be purchased at 29 yuan. Any nitpicking is extortion and will be severely punished. Government officials speak as government officials, and merchants speak as merchants. The positions are different, but the principles are the same. Is it fair? (3) Recently, President Zeng frequently relied on his personal opinions and acted arbitrarily. Merchants occasionally made requests, and either said it was difficult to handle or said it should not be discussed. He acted arrogantly and disregarded everything. Is it legal according to the constitution?</p>
<h3>Qingwu Road to be Completed</h3>
<p>The Qingwu Road from Qingyangzhen in Jiangyin to Wujin has been under construction since March this year. More than half a year has passed, and all the projects such as the roadbed, bridges, and culverts have been completed. The crushed stone pavement is now being laid. Because the contractors are facing a tight deadline, the work is intense, and even gasoline lamps are lit to work overnight. The eastern section of the road has been paved to the 21st bridge, and the western section has been paved to the 18th bridge at the southern end of Qinan in the ninth district of Xishu. Only three kilometers have not yet been paved. It is expected that it will be fully completed by the end of this month and open to traffic. The Construction Department will send personnel to inspect and accept the project after the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Tuberculosis Prevention Department Implements Lung Examination</h3>
<p>The Wuyi Red Swastika Society Hospital has a tuberculosis prevention X-ray department. In addition to the registration fee, each person who goes for a lung examination will only be charged one yuan, middle school students will be charged eight jiao, and elementary school students will be charged six jiao. The fee will be collected from November 1st, every Sunday morning until 11:00 am, with a limit of 20 people each time. The hospital also has the Majishan Lung Disease Sanatorium, which has already opened. The address is Fenghuangling, Guzhu Xiang, surrounded by lakes, fresh air, perfect facilities, and low fees.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Police Officer Shot While Arresting Gamblers</h3>
<p>Since the new grains have been on the market, the peasants of the various villages all use the excuse of gambling to have a good time. Patrol Officer Dong Daguang of the first police station of the South Suburb Public Security Bureau learned that there was a gambling den at the Sheyuan Sanbao Shidun Convent and led the police to the scene. Unexpectedly, there were more than 80 gamblers. Most of them escaped, and only nine people including the owner, Jin Ziwen, were arrested. In the confusion, police officer Yao Wenyun's box gun went off and the bullet pierced his right foot. The gamblers were sent to the county for trial and sentencing on the 28th. The injured policeman was sent to Jiangyin Hospital. In the afternoon, Shen, the prosecutor, went to examine the injury. The condition did not look serious.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Raising Funds to Purchase Grain for Famine Relief</h3>
<p>The Jiangdu County Government convened a food management committee on the afternoon of the 28th, and decided to raise 20,000 yuan to purchase grain to store for famine relief. Zhou Guren, Zhu Ganchen, Zhang Ganting, Yu Peiren, and Zhu Lizun were appointed as the five members responsible for handling the matter.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Money Houses Handling the Collection of Funds</h3>
<p>The money houses in this city, having extended long-term credit to industrial and commercial firms in Shanghai, with the deadline of November 10th approaching, have been sending personnel to Shanghai in recent days to handle the collection of funds. Those with established credit are being granted extensions until May 10th of next year. The internal trading rate for this period is five yuan and five jiao per thousand yuan. The total amount of loans issued by various firms is reportedly similar to the previous period, remaining around ten million yuan. The issue of long-term loans in this city has also begun to be handled, making the workload of various firms quite busy lately.</p>
<h3>Impending Drought Threatens to Become a Disaster</h3>
<p>The counties under the jurisdiction of Ningbo are mostly mountainous, with relatively few fields. Agricultural crops rely heavily on rainfall. Since the beginning of autumn, there has been no rain for two months, making the drought particularly severe. As a result, rivers have dried up, making navigation difficult and irrigation water sources scarce. If it does not rain soon, it will inevitably lead to a very serious drought disaster.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing: Fire at Baoyou Bridge</h3>
<p>A fire broke out under Baoyou Bridge in Shaoxing at approximately 1:00 AM on the 27th. It originated in the Jiuhua Oil Candle Shop. Because the shop was filled with flammable materials, once ignited, it was impossible to control. After firefighters from various volunteer groups arrived and worked to extinguish the blaze, it was finally put out. It is estimated that five or six businesses were destroyed, including the Ding Hexing Niangao Shop, Qingxiang Fruit Shop, and Yuanxing Wine and Sauce Shop, along with more than ten houses.</p>
<h3>Cixi: Exemption of Public Land Tax</h3>
<p>In the past, this county acquired much civilian land for the construction of the Ciyang Road and the excavation of the Xiaoxi Dike. The landowners repeatedly petitioned for exemption from land taxes. After receiving the petitions, the county government had a map drawn up and submitted it to the provincial government for review. Yesterday, an order was received stating that because this civilian land was acquired for public use, it should be exempt from property taxes. After receiving the order, the county government has instructed the collection office to proceed accordingly.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Major Fire on Qingtai Road Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>At 4:55 AM on the 29th, a fire suddenly broke out at the Taihe Clothing Store at No. 305 Qingtai Road in Hangzhou due to a short circuit in the storage area. The fire quickly spread. The store's employees were awakened from their sleep and quickly called the fire department, which dispatched fire trucks to the scene. It took more than an hour to extinguish the blaze. It is estimated that five buildings and clothing goods were destroyed, with total losses exceeding 40,000 yuan. The store had fire insurance for 20,000 yuan. The accountant, Pan Wenyou, has been detained by the Public Security Bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3>Panic Over Drinking Water in the City</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn, Hangzhou has experienced a long period of sunny weather with no rain for nearly two months. Rivers and drinking wells have gradually dried up. Inland river boats can hardly pass. City residents must rely on tap water for drinking water, leading to a sharp increase in tap water users. The required amount of tap water during the peak summer season is 1.3 million gallons per day. However, the daily demand for water in autumn has reached 1.7 million gallons, which is beyond expectations. Moreover, the only source of tap water is the nearby Tiesha River. The river water level has already dropped by three feet. If it does not rain for another half month, the drinking water problem in the city will become quite difficult.</p>
<h3>Recent Overview of Guangdong and Guangxi (11)</h3>
<p>— Our reporter Xiao An</p>
<p>Visits to Various Important People</p>
<p>After arriving at the headquarters of the Fourth Group Army, Commander-in-Chief Li DeLin immediately granted an audience and spoke freely for an hour before concluding. Afterward, a visit was made to Vice Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Group Army Bai JianSheng, with another hour of discussion. Subsequently, visits were made to Provincial Chairman Huang XuChu, Central Committee Members Li RenRen and Liu LuYin, Political Training Director of the Fourth Group Army Pan YiZhi, Provincial Party Committee Member Huang JunDa, Nanning District Civil Corps Commander Liang HanSong, Chief of Staff Fan YuFeng, former Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs in the Five Southwestern Provinces Gan JieHou, and Nanning Republic Daily President Hu NeSheng, among others. All had detailed and clear discussions regarding the Sino-Japanese problem over the years, foreign policy, political propositions, the organization of the past Southwest, Guangxi's position, the actions between July and September of this year, party affairs, civil corps, education, construction, roads, and the newspaper business. Unfortunately, these could not be recorded.</p>
<p>Thoughts Over a Week</p>
<p>In addition to visiting various important figures, I also visited the Provincial Museum, Chengnan Zhongshan Park, the Provincial Second Library, the Military Medical Department's pharmaceutical testing and manufacturing facility, the National Defense Drama Troupe, the Nanning Republic Daily, the Wuming Nanning District Civil Corps Headquarters and its rural construction, and toured Lu Rongting's General's Residence and the Mingxiu Garden operated by Lu, as well as Qifeng Mountain, a famous scenic spot in Wuming. I also strolled through the Nanning city streets at night. In total, this took a week. Looking back on this week, based on personal observations, there are indelible impressions, which I will broadly describe as follows: (1) The educational expenditure of Guangxi Province is greater than any other expenditure, so illiteracy in the entire province has been eradicated. (2) Roads are extremely developed, and the economy has also been developed, so there is no news of bandits or unemployed people. Furthermore, in Nanning City, there are no beggars. (3) Although the government and the people are poor, both above and below have the slogan of "doing things poor," and everything must be done with a tight budget, unwilling to waste a penny. The construction of public utilities mostly adopts the method of conscripting labor and materials to easily complete them. (4) Civil servants, students, and even newspaper reporters all wear military caps and military uniforms, and the value of each set is stipulated not to exceed five yuan. In simplicity, the sluggishness of the past is swept away. (5) Everywhere there are slogans and paintings that awaken the public to love and save the country, and construction goals to save the chaotic, poor, ignorant, and weak. (6) High-ranking officials do not privately own cars. If a car is needed, they request it from the Transportation Department. After use, the car is returned to the Transportation Department. Therefore, everyone has access to a car, but each saves money on car purchases. The above points can be clearly seen by anyone who has set foot in Guangxi, and they are also the most profound impressions on me.</p>
<p>The journey from Yongning still used a Southwest Airlines plane. The one going to Guangzhou was called Beidou. The plane came from Longzhou in the morning. Because the northeast wind was very strong, it was delayed until 12:30 before arriving in Yongning. After refueling, it flew east. Because of the northeast wind, it landed in Guixian for refueling before heading to Rongxian. However, due to the strong northeast wind, the plane was extremely turbulent and the journey was very slow. It arrived in Guangzhou at 5:10 PM. After a brief rest in Guangzhou, I bought a boat ticket north and returned. The journey to Guangdong and Guangxi was thus completed. (The End)</p>

<h3>Promoting Sino-Italian Culture: Exchange of Professorial Lectures</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has authorized President Zou of Sun Yat-sen University, and the negotiations have been fruitful.</p>
<p>Sino-Italian cultural relations have been developing increasingly in recent years. According to a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency, the exchange of professorial lectures between the Italian Far East and Near East Society and Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou has taken concrete form. When President of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou attended the International University Presidents Conference in Rome this year, he requested the Chinese Embassy in Italy to contact Italy regarding the exchange of one professor. The professor's treatment would include food, lodging, and transportation. He could also bring his family. The lecture period would be six months. The Chinese professor would preferably be able to lecture on grammar. If he could not speak English, it would also be acceptable. The subject would focus on Eastern philosophy. The Italian professor could be designated by China, focusing on mathematics and science. The Ministry of Education has authorized Sun Yat-sen University to contact Italy regarding this exchange. This exchange of professors between China and Italy is the first of its kind, and it is very important for promoting culture between the two countries.

<h3>Overview of National Education (II)</h3>
<p>— Lei Zhen</p>
<p>(Lecture at Employment Counseling Class for Colleges and Above)</p>
<p>(II) Status of National Secondary Education</p>
<p>Lecture 2: The Status of Secondary Education. Secondary education is one level higher than primary education in the education system. Its institutions can be divided into three types: middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools. These three types of schools have equal standards but different characteristics. They are described separately below, starting with middle schools. Middle schools provide foundational training that continues from primary school, aiming to develop young people's physical and mental well-being, cultivate healthy citizens, and serve as a place for preparing for advanced academic studies and various professions. They are divided into junior middle schools and senior middle schools, which can be established together. The duration of study for each is three years. Junior middle schools enroll primary school graduates or students with equivalent academic qualifications. Senior middle schools enroll junior middle school graduates. In areas where the number of junior middle school graduates is too small, students with equivalent academic qualifications may also be enrolled, but their number must not exceed one-fifth of the total enrollment. According to the Ministry of Education's statistics for the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), there are a total of 1,920 middle schools nationwide, including 493 schools with both senior and junior levels, 41 senior middle schools, and 1,386 junior middle schools. In addition, there are 147 middle school classes attached to other schools, including 11 senior middle school classes and 136 junior middle school classes. There are 415,948 middle school students nationwide, with 10 middle school students per 10,000 people, including 66,325 senior middle school students and 349,623 junior middle school students. Only one out of every three primary school graduates enters junior middle school, and only one out of every five junior middle school graduates enters senior middle school. The reason for the small number of students advancing to higher levels is partly due to economic difficulties and the inability to afford schooling, and partly because there are too few middle schools, leaving no schools to enter. It is evident from the fact that each middle school attracts thousands of applicants, while only dozens or hundreds are admitted. To help students from financially disadvantaged families attend school, the practice of setting up free places in middle schools through scholarship systems should be actively promoted. In addition, new middle schools should be established in appropriate locations to accommodate primary school graduates who cannot continue their education.</p>
<p>Normal schools are places for rigorously training young people's physical and mental well-being and cultivating sound teachers for primary schools. Normal schools that focus on training teachers for rural primary schools are called rural normal schools. In addition, there are four other types: kindergarten normal departments, special normal departments, simple normal schools, and simple rural normal schools. The duration of study at normal schools and rural normal schools is two years, enrolling junior middle school graduates. Kindergarten normal departments are attached to normal schools and are places for cultivating sound teachers for kindergartens. The duration of study is two or three years, enrolling junior middle school graduates. Special normal departments are attached to normal schools or public middle schools. The duration of study is one year, enrolling senior middle school or senior vocational school graduates. Simple normal schools are established to train teachers for compulsory education, with a duration of study of one year for junior middle school graduates and four years for primary school graduates. Those that focus on training teachers for rural compulsory education are called simple rural normal schools, with a duration of study of four years, enrolling primary school graduates. According to the Ministry of Education's statistics for the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), there are a total of 893 normal schools nationwide, including 151 normal schools, 94 rural normal schools, 389 simple normal schools, and 259 simple rural normal schools. In addition, there are 208 normal departments attached to middle schools and vocational schools (including 115 regular normal departments, 31 rural normal departments, 105 simple normal departments, and 57 simple rural normal departments). The total number of normal school students nationwide is 100,840, with two normal school students per 10,000 people. The ratio of normal school students to primary school students is 1 to 120. There are too few normal school students. To promote universal education, more normal schools should be established and more normal school students should be recruited to cultivate teachers who are physically and mentally sound.</p>
<p>Normal schools are places for training primary school teachers and are very important for primary school education. Therefore, it is stipulated that they should be established by provincial governments or municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan. They may also be established by county governments, municipal governments, or jointly by two or more counties based on local needs. Except for kindergarten normal departments and normal schools that train teachers for primary school crafts, library science, music, home economics, and physical education, private individuals are generally not allowed to establish normal schools. The location of their establishment should be determined based on local conditions and should be set up in cities or villages. They should be established in rural areas as much as possible. Simple normal schools should be established by counties and cities in principle and should be established in rural areas as much as possible. Because there are many rural areas in our country, and the primary schools that have already been established are mostly located in cities, we should promote the establishment of more rural primary schools. Therefore, there is a great need for rural primary school teachers, so we must prepare early and establish more rural normal schools to train rural primary school teachers and personnel for agricultural extension, rural autonomy, economic construction, and local health.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to ensure that primary school teachers are evenly distributed throughout the country, the educational administrative organs of each province may divide the province into several normal school districts based on the conditions of the province. Each normal school district may have one normal school and one girls' normal school to cultivate sound primary school teachers for the district.</p>
<p>With the exception of private normal schools, tuition fees are generally waived. Some also waive part or all of the board and lodging fees. Graduates are generally required to serve in the education field and are not allowed to pursue further studies or change to other professions within the prescribed period. Otherwise, they will be required to refund the tuition, board, and lodging fees.</p>
<p>Vocational schools are places for cultivating young people's knowledge of life and skills of production. They are divided into junior vocational schools and senior vocational schools. Those that combine junior and senior levels are called vocational schools. Junior vocational schools enroll primary school graduates or those with equivalent qualifications aged 12 to 18. The duration of study is one to three years, and may be shortened as appropriate when necessary. Senior vocational schools enroll junior middle school graduates or those with equivalent qualifications aged 15 to 22. The duration of study is three years, unless otherwise stipulated by law. Those that enroll primary school graduates or those with equivalent qualifications aged 11 to 20 have a duration of study of five or six years. The establishment of vocational schools should be based on single departments. For example, in agriculture, there are departments such as animal husbandry, sericulture, and horticulture. A vocational school can be established independently for one of these departments, such as animal husbandry or horticulture. By doing so, the scope of the profession is smaller, and the tools needed within that professional scope can be easily and fully equipped. It is also easier to hire specialized talents as teachers and technicians, and what students learn is not just theoretical knowledge, but real skills that can be used to manufacture domestic products and solve livelihood problems. Vocational schools that are established with a single department or subject are called junior or senior vocational schools of a certain department. Those that establish two or more departments are called junior or senior vocational schools of a certain type, such as agricultural, industrial, commercial, or home economics vocational schools. Those that combine several industries are called junior or senior vocational schools. In addition, there is a system of short-term vocational training classes, which aims to train technicians in a certain business. They can be called vocational training institutes, vocational training centers, or vocational lecture halls. There are two types of classes, one for junior middle school graduates or those with equivalent qualifications, and one for senior middle school graduates or those with equivalent qualifications. The training period is set for three to fifteen months, depending on the nature of the profession.</p>
<p>Vocational schools are established by provinces or cities directly under the Executive Yuan, but may be established by local governments or jointly by two or more counties based on local needs. Private individuals or organizations may also establish vocational schools. In the 29th year of the Republic (1940), the central government allocated 890,000 yuan and 950,000 yuan to prepare for the establishment of national model vocational schools, and 300,000 yuan to subsidize excellent public and private vocational schools to encourage them. According to the Ministry of Education's statistics for the 10th year of the Republic (1921), there are 312 vocational schools nationwide, including 42 schools with both senior and junior levels, 74 senior schools, and 196 junior schools. In addition, there are 117 vocational departments attached to other schools, including 77 senior departments and 40 junior departments. There are a total of 41,532 vocational school students nationwide, including 15,254 senior students and 17,178 junior students. There is less than one vocational school student per 10,000 people, and the ratio compared to middle school students is 1 to 10. The number is really too small.</p>
<p>Based on the statistics of the number of students in the above three types of schools—middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools—there are 10 middle school students, 2 normal school students, and less than 1 vocational school student per 10,000 people. This is, of course, because there are fewer normal schools and vocational schools than middle schools. According to the Ministry of Education's regulations on the standard for the distribution of secondary education funds in each province and city, middle schools account for 40%, normal schools account for 25%, and vocational schools account for 35%. The establishment of normal schools and vocational schools should be promoted. However, the general public has been influenced by the traditional concept that "scholars are the first of the four classes," and they despise farmers, workers, and merchants. Even primary school teachers are considered to be scholars who have failed to achieve prominence. Therefore, most people send their children to middle schools and are unwilling to send them to vocational schools or normal schools. Many young people also think this way. If a child is intelligent and comes from a good family, they should continue their basic scientific training from primary school to middle school, with the expectation of entering a university or specialized school. However, if they want to change to a career, they should observe their personality and see if they are suitable for learning normal school or other professions, and then have them apply to normal schools or vocational schools. It is more useful for them to become primary school teachers or engage in production after graduation, rather than forcing them to pursue further studies, achieving nothing, and finding it difficult to find a suitable job. This is a point of view that is worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>(III) Status of National Higher Education</p>
<p>Lecture 2: The Status of Higher Education. In the education system, education that is one level higher than secondary education is called higher education. Higher education institutions can be broadly divided into four types: specialized schools, universities, independent colleges, and university graduate schools.</p>
<p>Specialized schools aim to teach applied sciences and train technicians. They enroll senior middle school graduates or those with equivalent academic qualifications. The duration of study is two or three years, which may be determined separately by each school according to its type. Medical specialized schools require one year of internship after completing three years of coursework. According to the Ministry of Education's statistics for the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), there are a total of 21 specialized schools nationwide, including 5 national schools, 5 ministry-run schools, 11 provincial schools, municipal schools, and 9 private schools. In terms of the nature of their departments, 12 schools have medical departments, 18 schools have arts departments (literature, law, commerce, education). There are 9 more arts departments than practical departments. In detail, there are 7 art specialized schools, pharmaceutical specialized schools, Fengyi specialized schools, 4 physical education specialized schools, 2 industrial specialized schools, 2 commercial specialized schools, and 1 specialized school each for merchant marine, police officers, water conservancy engineering, teacher training, sinology, and library science. There are a total of 4,511 students in specialized schools nationwide, including 2,363 in public schools and 2,148 in private schools. Compared to public and private schools, the number of students is almost the same, but there are 12 more public schools. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Construction Drawings of the Ping City Public Sports Field are Decided</h3>
<p>Construction to Begin Next Spring</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) The Ping City Public Sports Field has recently been implementing plans for all construction. The field map has now been decided. The shape of the building is a circular track and field field with two central gates. The straight track is 100 meters and the thin track is 200 meters. The command platform is on the west side. Outside the track and field field on the east and west sides, there are four tennis courts, two basketball courts, a baseball field, and a football field. The map has been drawn three times and is very detailed. Yesterday at noon, Li Zhoujiao, the physical education supervisor of the Social Affairs Bureau, Ku Ji, Yuan Dunli, and engineer Yang Tingzhi examined the detailed drawings of the sports field at the Jieying Fancai Restaurant, discussing all aspects of each part. The Department has also completed the work and instructed the engineer to draw detailed sectional drawings. The Yue Nei will be submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau, Qin De, and Ran Chengwei Zheyuan for approval. After approval, the construction fee will be allocated and deposited into the bank. Due to the cold weather, it is not advisable to start construction, so it will be postponed until next spring. However, bidding will be invited within the year. It is rumored in Ping City that the construction cost has been changed to 100,000 yuan. According to reporters' inquiries from various parties, it is said that the construction of the stands of the track and field field will require 140,000 yuan, the running track and jumping pit will cost 15,000 yuan, and the remaining 15,000 yuan will be used to repair the ball field and as a fund. The difference between 100,000 yuan is too great. Engineer Yang Tingbin took a car to Beijing last night to meet with Guan Songsheng to discuss all the field maps and other matters in detail.</p>
<p>In another report, the problem of building the public sports field has been largely decided after the drawings were revised twice. It was previously reported that the municipal government planned to allocate 100,000 yuan in advance and start construction. Yesterday, Li Zhou, a physical education supervisor of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters that the municipal government's allocation of 100,000 yuan for construction has been approved today (28th) and the Finance Bureau has been ordered to issue it quickly. However, since the amount is too far from the original budget, I intend to plan with all parties. I am currently discussing methods with the members and I am confident that a solution can be found in the short term. (Jin) October 28th</p>

Ye Muzhen's running high jump broke the national record with a height of 1.37 meters. The rest of the events also had remarkable results.</p>
<h3>Recent Overview of Soviet Sports (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Song Ruhai</p>
<p>Soviet Russian physical education instructors are divided into four levels according to their level of education. In the spring of 1926, the central government specially established training courses to recruit fourth-level instructors to improve their physical education theory and sports skills. A total of 7,600 people joined the training. The two physical education academies in Moscow and Leningrad established special classes to improve the level of first-level physical education instructors, with more than 1,000 participants. Currently, the education authorities feel that the instructors produced by schools at all levels are not enough to allocate, so it is decided to increase (A) four physical education academies in the autumn of 1936, recruiting 8,000 students, (B) six secondary schools, recruiting 5,000 students, and (C) opening short-term physical education training courses in various villages. Judging from the scale of the above schools, the Soviet Union's training of sports talents is meticulous. According to Ruhai's investigation in various countries, the change in the number of service personnel in the Soviet sports world is more than in any other country.</p>
<p>Since Soviet-German sports are so developed, the cost of common education and construction and the consumption of sports equipment are worth studying. In 1935, the government promoted a total of 500 million rubles for sports. (Each ruble is equivalent to one yuan and three jiao in national currency.) The sports expenditure during the Tsarist era was only 80,000 rubles. In 1936, the government had spent 100 million on the construction of sports fields in various places, and the total value of sports equipment sold by various factories was 318 million rubles. Judging from these figures, the popularity and effectiveness of Soviet social sports are truly advancing by leaps and bounds. There are two largest sports organization in the country, one named Dyname and the other named Spartak. These two associations promote sports and have trained many people with special skills. The Dyname Sports Association has a sports equipment manufacturing plant, and its products currently account for 60% of the entire Russia. All the annual surplus profit is used to promote sports.</p>
<p>Observing the above facts, we know the reason why its sports development is rapid and widespread. There are two points to pay attention to. The first point is that the Stakhanorite movement was at its peak in 1936. The movement increased the economic capacity of workers and civilians and created social prosperity, making the development of sports more popular. The second point is that in 1936, the Central Sports Commission issued more than 6 million medals. It also shows that the effectiveness of social sports is progressing very rapidly. However, the Soviet Union has set the following slogans for promoting sports:</p>
<p>(1) Exercise the physique every year to prepare for labor service and national defense.</p>
<p>(2) To make every young person intelligent and powerful, and to create healthy citizens.</p>
<p>(3) Increase national sports skills and work efficiency.</p>
<p>(4) Special respect and sincerity should be paid to the health of workers.</p>

<h3>Shanghai to Celebrate Chiang Kai-shek's 50th Birthday Tomorrow with Flag Display; City Party Headquarters Notifies All Sectors of the City Regarding Measures; Movie Theaters to Screen Portraits and Birthday Greetings</h3>
<p>October 31st marks the 50th birthday of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Shanghai is presenting ten airplanes and a medical rescue plane from the Catholic Church. Representatives were dispatched to Nanjing to attend the aircraft presentation ceremony. To express fervent celebration through the purchase of airplanes, letters were sent to various government offices, organizations, schools, businesses, and households, requesting that they uniformly display flags on this day. Furthermore, all movie theaters were notified to add Chairman Chiang's portrait and birthday greetings to each screening, and to inform the audience to stand and pay respects during the portrait screening. This will continue for three days. The Shanghai Municipal Fundraising Committee for Airplane Purchase for Birthday Celebration held a meeting of its officers at 6 PM on the 27th, attended by Li Dachao, Zhou Songhe, Li Huiran, Zhang Xiamin, and others. Li Dachao chaired the meeting, and Chen Shuo served as the recorder. The chairman reported, in brief, that the city's aircraft presentation ceremony had already been held on the 24th of this month, with a large number of attendees. The committee has already raised and submitted 635,430.91 yuan. Shanghai has committed to 1,000,000 yuan, leaving a shortfall of 364,629.09 yuan. All organizations and individuals who have pledged but not yet paid, or have not yet donated, are urged to expedite their contributions and submit them before the 30th for consolidation and remittance. After the launch of the "Aviation to Save the Nation, Airplane Presentation for Birthday Celebration" campaign, Mr. Wang Xiaolai and others proposed and passed a resolution at the 17th meeting of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to notify all organizations to take action. The committee also sent letters to various trade associations, requesting them to inform their member stores to assist to the best of their ability, as well as schools and cultural organizations at all levels. Representatives were also dispatched to make contact. All sectors warmly supported and responded, and contributions are being submitted successively. The final results are expected to be considerable. Furthermore, the Chiang Kai-shek birthday airplane presentation ceremony is scheduled to be held on the 31st of this month at the Ming Palace airfield in Nanjing. Following reports from the officers on the progress of their outreach, various fundraising plans were discussed, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Party Headquarters Notice</p>
<p>Tomorrow (31st) marks the 50th birthday of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The city's Party Headquarters originally intended to join with all sectors to hold a large-scale celebration. Subsequently, a telegram from the Central Committee ordered its cancellation. The headquarters has now learned that all sectors of the city will hold separate celebrations at that time to express their congratulations. Therefore, three celebratory measures have been drafted and notified to all agencies and organizations in the city for uniform implementation. The measures are as follows: (1) Display flags to mark the occasion; (2) Each agency and organization should erect arches at their entrances with celebratory couplets; (3) Responsible personnel from each agency and organization should lead their entire staff in sending telegrams of congratulations. The city's Party Headquarters' previously planned dinner party for all Party members to celebrate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday, originally scheduled at the Atlantic Western Restaurant on Fuzhou Road tomorrow afternoon, will proceed. However, the originally planned evening entertainment gala will no longer be held due to the Central Committee's order to cancel preparations.</p>
<p>Catholic Community Presents Airplanes</p>
<p>The Catholic faithful throughout the nation, in honor of President Chiang's 50th birthday, in addition to Archbishop Cai, the representative of the Roman Curia, Bishop Hui of the Shanghai Diocese, and Bishop Yu Bin of the Nanjing Diocese issuing a joint notification to the 3.5 million Catholics nationwide to hold a grand prayer on October 31st, Chiang Kai-shek's birthday, to beseech God's blessings, also commissioned Mr. Lu Bohong, the president of the Chinese Catholic Action General Association, to initiate a fundraising drive among domestic Catholics to purchase and donate several medical rescue planes. Due to the limited time, the association devised a plan to advance the funds to purchase and donate two medical rescue planes to President Chiang to express congratulations and demonstrate their sincere respect and love for the government leader. The two planes are named "Catholic Medical Rescue Plane No. 1" and "Catholic Medical Rescue Plane No. 2". The funds for these planes were submitted by Mr. Lu Bohong yesterday to the Shanghai Presentation Committee for verification and receipt. It is also reported that Bishop Yu Bin, Mr. Lu Bohong, and Mr. Lu Yigeng will represent the Catholic faithful at the national airplane presentation ceremony in Nanjing on the 31st.</p>
<p>Team Celebrations</p>
<p>For Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday, the Shanghai Security Teams Special Party Department originally planned to hold large-scale celebrations to honor the Chairman and the nation. However, they were informed by the Central Committee that such celebrations were unnecessary. Nevertheless, the Party Department believes that the Chairman's loyalty and diligence to the Party and the nation, and his perseverance through hardship, make his spirit of longevity for the nation a model for all people.

<p>Sky Letter of Longevity</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, a pilot from China National Aviation Corporation flew a Stinson trainer plane at Longhua Airport to practice releasing smoke. First, the plane released smoke from its tail to form the shape of the Chinese character for "longevity". Then, it spelled out the four letters "CNAC" ("CNAC" is the English abbreviation for China National Aviation Corporation.) At that time, the sky was clear and blue, and the setting sun reflected the white smoke, making it appear silver. The sight was very beautiful. Unfortunately, the wind was strong yesterday, and the smoke did not last long. The plane landed at around 5 PM.</p>

<h3>Honoring Birthdays with Local Products - Order to Stop</h3>
<p>Collecting Gifts and Sending Them Back with Letters - Participating Businesses Jointly Send Telegrams of Congratulations</p>
<p>Various organizations, including the Shanghai China Native Products Promotion Association, previously initiated a campaign to collect local product gifts to present to Chairman Chiang in Nanjing to celebrate his birthday. Yesterday morning, they received an order from the Second Department of the Military Affairs Commission Office, relayed from Chairman Chiang, stating that, apart from donating funds to purchase aircraft to be presented to the National Government, all other gifts would not be accepted. Consequently, an emergency meeting was convened yesterday morning to discuss the disposal of the collected birthday gifts. The outcome was a decision to return each company's products with a letter, as Chairman Chiang had already stated they would not be accepted. At the same time, a joint telegram of congratulations was sent to Chairman Chiang in the name of the participating native product birthday celebration organizations and businesses. The telegram read: "To Chairman Chiang, Nanjing Military Affairs Commission: Your leadership in the revolution and construction of China serves as a pillar in the torrent, turning the tide from collapse. You unified the country, pacified internal troubles, sought the revival of the nation, and laid the foundation for lasting stability. Your virtues are widely praised, and both domestic and foreign communities admire you. Concerned for the nation amidst the ravages of war and the people in turmoil, you should develop the economy and strive for construction to alleviate the people's hardships and enrich their lives. Your call to lead the National Economic Construction Movement has resonated throughout the country. Our association and others, deeply appreciating your intention for economic construction, and recognizing that the primary lifeline of our nation's economy lies in the rural areas, and that developing the rural economy requires first maintaining our nation's native product production to resist the import of foreign goods and circulate rural finance, have spared no effort in researching and experimenting with the production and marketing of native products over the years. Therefore, we took advantage of your birthday to collect famous native products and improved products from across the country, including clothing, food, and daily necessities, and sent representatives to present them, expressing our sincere wishes. Just as we were about to depart, we received your order that, apart from donating funds to purchase aircraft to be presented to the National Government, all other gifts would not be accepted. Our association and others, complying with your order to cease the gift presentation, respectfully send this telegram of heartfelt congratulations, wishing you health and longevity.

<h3>Grain Merchants P petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday to Revoke the Prohibition Orders of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces, and Proposed Measures for the Domestic Circulation of Rice and Wheat in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the Zhejiang Provincial Government detained rice boats bound for Shanghai, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government resolved to prohibit the export of grain, the Shanghai Grain Trade Association, after an emergency meeting, sent Mr. Chen Ziyi, Mr. Zhu Zixiang, and Mr. , with a petition to the Shanghai Municipal Government to see Mayor Wu. Secretary-General Yu Hongjun received them on behalf of the Mayor. Regarding the prohibition of grain exports by Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, which greatly affects the food supply of Shanghai residents, they promised to immediately telegraph both provincial governments to revoke the prohibition orders. Subsequently, they went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, where Director Pan Gongzhan received them. Regarding the prohibition of grain exports by Jiangsu Province, they had already telegraphed requesting revocation. As for the detention of rice boats bound for Shanghai by Zhejiang Province, they would immediately telegraph requesting their release. The representatives considered the outcome satisfactory and appointed Mr. Gu Xinyi to go to Nanjing tonight to petition the Ministry of Industry of the Executive Yuan, instructing Zhejiang Province to release the detained rice boats and Jiangsu Province to halt the proposed measures. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Petition to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>The petition to the Shanghai Municipal Government stated: "We believe that the agricultural production of each province in our country varies from place to place, with supply and demand mutually responding, and surpluses and deficits being adjusted, so as to provide sufficient food for the people and prevent damage to their livelihoods. Therefore, the late Premier Sun Yat-sen had the clear instruction to evenly distribute food, and the Central Government issued a clear order on the domestic circulation of rice and wheat in the 21st year of the Republic (1932). Now, with frequent foreign incursions and national crisis looming, preventing rice and grain from aiding the enemy is not only what the government should do, but also what the people should have in mind. On the 9th of this month, our association drafted temporary measures for the domestic circulation of rice and wheat in this city and submitted them to the Social Affairs Bureau to be forwarded to your office for review and implementation. It seems that precautions have already been taken to prohibit the export of grain abroad, with no worries of omissions. However, in recent days, we have received reports from our colleagues that in Jiaxing, Pinghu, and other places in Zhejiang Province, the detention of rice shipments to Shanghai, regardless of whether they are in bags or in bulk, has occurred several times a day. For those in bags, they are suspected of being exported, and the enforcement is even stricter. However, it is not known that packing rice in bags is to prevent water adulteration and fraud, and in fact, it is also to meet the needs of the Shanghai people's food supply. Since the news of the detention and obstruction of rice shipments in Zhejiang Province spread, grain merchants have suffered losses and are worried about unexpected dangers, and have been shocked. Furthermore, Jiangsu Province, which has always been the richest rice-producing area, as reported yesterday, the provincial government has also resolved to strictly prohibit the export of grain, and the atmosphere in the markets has suddenly become panic-stricken. Shanghai has a population of over three million, and their daily food needs depend on a steady supply from the producing areas to avoid shortages. With Zhejiang and Jiangsu successively imposing prohibitions, the food supply in this city will become a dried-up track. The impact is beyond words. In addition to sending representatives from our association to present everything in person, we dare to briefly describe the harms and petition Your Honor to investigate and quickly consult with the Zhejiang Provincial Government to revoke the prohibition order, and order the immediate release of all rice detained in Jiaxing, Huzhou, and other counties. Also, consult with the Jiangsu Provincial Government to halt the proposed measures, so as to comply with national decrees and maintain the food supply of this city. We are sincerely grateful."</p>
<p>Petition to the Central Government</p>
<p>The Grain Trade Association has appointed Chairman Gu Xinyi as the representative of the grain industry to take advantage of the opportunity to go to Nanjing to present aircraft and congratulate Chiang's birthday, and to petition the Ministry of Industry of the Executive Yuan. Mr. Gu is scheduled to take the Shanghai-Nanjing night express train to Nanjing tonight. The petition to the Ministry of Industry of the Executive Yuan is recorded as follows: "We believe that the agricultural production of each province in our country (the middle part is the same as the petition to the Municipal Government). Our association feels that the situation is critical and dare not remain silent. We have sent Mr. Gu Xinyi to present the petition in person to report the harms. We respectfully request Your Excellency to investigate and quickly order the Zhejiang Provincial Government to revoke the prohibition order, and order the immediate release of all rice detained in Jiaxing, Huzhou, and other counties. Also, order the Jiangsu Provincial Government to halt the proposed measures, so as to comply with national decrees and maintain the food supply of this city. We are sincerely awaiting orders."</p>
<p>Circulation Measures</p>
<p>Attached are the four temporary measures for the domestic circulation of rice and wheat in this city proposed to the Social Affairs Bureau on October 9th: (1) The temporary handling of rice and wheat circulation matters in this city should originally be presided over by Your Bureau. However, grain merchants are scattered in the special districts, and most are concentrated in the Nanshi district, making travel back and forth very inconvenient. Therefore, it is proposed that Your Bureau select committee members to handle the matter jointly with our association. (2) When grain merchants in this city ship rice and wheat, they must fill out an application form with the business name, the shipping date, the quantity, the name of the ship, the destination, and the receiving business, and submit it for approval. After approval, a shipping permit stamped by Your Bureau will be issued. (3) The aforementioned application form should be filled out in duplicate, with one copy kept by our association and one copy submitted to Your Bureau for verification and reference. (4) The applicant should carry the shipping permit to the Jianghai Customs to declare the shipment for release. The customs should not allow transshipment without this shipping permit.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cloth Exchange Ordered to Seize Cotton Warehouse Receipts - Silver and Banking Industries Held Joint Meeting Yesterday - Resolved on the Spot to Request the Court to Exempt from Seizure - Exchange Petitioned the Court to State Reasons - Court Agreed to Make Changes, Transactions Can Be Settled Today</h3>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Yarn and Cloth Exchange was ordered by the First Special District Court to provisionally seize cotton warehouse receipts, which is bound to cause difficulties for today's settlement. Chairman Mu Ouchu and Director Wen Lanting were specially sent to petition the court. At the same time, the Silver and Banking Industries Associations held a joint meeting and resolved to request exemption from seizure to facilitate circulation. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Court Ordered the Exchange to Seize</p>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Exchange recently received an order from the First Special District Court, stating that "because two merchants, A and B, traded more than 100,000 bales of cotton, and B believed that the cotton delivered by A did not meet the standards during the transaction, resulting in unsuccessful negotiations between the two merchants, B filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court." The court then ordered the exchange to provisionally seize A's cotton warehouse receipts for sampling and testing the quality. The exchange found no records of A and B's names and therefore reported the situation to the court. Yesterday morning, the court issued another order, still instructing them to comply with the previous order.</p>
<p>Problems Arise with Today's Settlement</p>
<p>Cotton warehouse receipts in the Chinese Cotton Yarn and Cloth Exchange are in bearer form and circulate in the market based on the receipts, not the people. If the court order is followed and the receipts are provisionally seized, problems are bound to arise with today's yarn and flower settlement. At the same time, the silver and banking industries have a mortgage relationship, which will also be greatly affected. Therefore, the exchange sent a letter to the Silver and Banking Industries Associations requesting a joint meeting, which unanimously advocated requesting the court to exempt from provisional seizure to facilitate circulation.</p>
<p>Joint Meeting of Silver and Banking Industries</p>
<p>The Silver and Banking Industries Associations held a joint meeting at the Hong Kong Road Banking Club at 3:00 PM yesterday. Executive members Wu Yunzhai, Wu Weiru, Qu Jigang, Wang Boyuan, Hu Xiyan, Zhai Yunqing, Pan Jiufen, Yang J眉mei, Zhang Peishen, Liu Wuqiao, Lu Shuchen, Xu Wenqing, and others from both associations attended. Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Banking Association, was also present. Wu Yunzhai chaired the meeting and read the original letter from the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Exchange. After that, the discussion began, recognizing that it was indeed difficult to provisionally seize the warehouse receipts. A resolution was passed on the spot to petition the First Special District Court to exempt from seizure to facilitate circulation. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Changes Made After the Petition</p>
<p>Mu Ouchu, Director of the Chinese Cotton Yarn and Cloth Exchange, and Director Wen Lanting went to the First Special District Court at 2:00 PM yesterday to meet with Court President Guo Guan, stating the reasons why it was difficult to provisionally seize the receipts and requesting a reversal of the order. The clerk received them on behalf of the president. They left the court at around 3:00 PM. A reporter from the New Society learned from the exchange last night that the First Special District Court had agreed to make changes to the handling, so there should be no problems with today's exchange settlement.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cloth Exchange - Reply to the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Yarn and Cloth Exchange replied to the Ministry of Industry, stating: "Regarding the reply matter, we respectfully received your ministry's letter Shangzi No. 48968 and respectfully enclosed a copy of the original letter from the Wuxi County Cotton Textile Industry Association. We respectfully learned that your ministry, in order to conduct a prudent study, convened representatives from the Ministry of Finance's Cotton Industry Control Committee to discuss and add to the discussion, and separately decided on the following four corrective measures: (1) The exchange should order both buyers and sellers to pay the principal evidence money in accordance with the law, and the amount should be paid in accordance with the ratio stipulated in Article 31 of the Exchange Law. The exchange supervisor should strictly supervise, and violators will be punished. (2) The exchange's original fixed-term transaction of yarn and flowers, with a term of six months, should be shortened to four months. Initially, the reduction should be done in two stages, with each stage reducing by one month, as a trial. (3) Regarding the limit on the amount of futures trading: 1. The balance of futures trading for each broker in each month shall be limited to 5,000 pieces of cotton yarn and 20,000 dans of cotton. 2. If the limit is exceeded, from 5,050 to 10,000 pieces of cotton yarn and from 20,100 to 30,000 dans of cotton, in addition to the principal evidence money, cotton should be paid at 10% of the registered price per dan, and cotton yarn should be paid at 5%, which cannot be substituted. In addition, a special evidence money should be added according to the amount of the principal evidence money paid, which also cannot be substituted. 3. If the trading amount of cotton yarn is more than 10,000 pieces, every 5,000 pieces exceeded, and the trading amount of cotton is more than 30,000 dans, every 10,000 dans exceeded, the special evidence money shall be doubled progressively, and it cannot be substituted. (4) Reform and correct the flower and yarn appraisers: 1. Cotton appraisers should be hired who have no relationship with the flower and yarn industries and have studied cotton grading. 2. Cotton yarn appraisers should be hired who have no relationship with the flower and yarn industries and hold a textile technician registration certificate from the Ministry of Industry. The above four measures are generally based on the request of the original petitioner, and the allegations of the original petitioner, regardless of whether they are true or not, should legally give our exchange an opportunity to present a defense, and then your ministry can make a fair decision, which is enough to convince people. If only the one-sided complaint of the original petitioner is used to make a decision, it seems to be inconsistent with the general debate system. It is known that your ministry is fair and impartial in this matter and has no prejudice. However, because the original petitioner attacked our exchange, saying that it was indulgent in excessive speculation and focused on profits, etc., it was moved by these dangerous words, and thus there was this move. But if our exchange's representative had been present to clarify the actual situation at that time, it is deeply believed that there would never be such corrective measures. It can be asserted that this is what our exchange has to explain. Moreover, according to the points for correction claimed by the original petitioner this time, some have already been implemented by our exchange, or there are no clear regulations in the current laws and regulations, so it is not convenient to change them rashly. As for the remaining one or two sections, from the surface, it seems that speculators can be more cautious, but in reality, it not only fails to curb the activities of speculators, but also prevents legitimate flower and yarn merchants from hedging, losing the effectiveness of smoothing capital. The business and financial sectors are both suffering. It is not just the small interests of our exchange. The original petition is quite misunderstood about the business policy and management methods of our exchange, and it is quite ignorant of the original intention of the legislation and the structure of modern economic society. Therefore, although it is verbose and references many sources, the root is still one-sided, and it is difficult to understand the intention. Unfortunately, our exchange did not have the opportunity to present the situation, so the points raised by the original petitioner were adopted, and the three or four corrective measures decided, except for those that our exchange had already implemented, the remaining points are mostly obstructive when considering the facts. Even when proving the current laws, it is difficult to implement them. This matter concerns the prosperity of the national flower and yarn industry and the safety of the national enterprise. It is our responsibility and we dare not remain silent. We are forced to state the facts and respectfully ask you to review and approve the request to consult again with the Ministry of Finance and the Cotton Industry Control Committee, send a letter to inform our exchange to send a representative to attend and present the actual situation, so that under the premise of considering both law and fact, we can find appropriate measures to achieve effective results, which is fair and convenient. Respectfully submitted to Minister of Industry Wu."</p>
<h3>Party, Military, and Political Circles in This City - Preparing for Large-Scale Anti-Drug Campaign - Held Preparatory Meeting - Decided on Propaganda Principles</h3>
<p>According to Guomin News Agency, since the prohibition of opium and rejection of drugs was set by Chairman Chiang for a fixed period and strictly ordered local military and political organs to implement, considerable results have been seen. The Shanghai City Party Department, Garrison Headquarters, Municipal Public Security Bureau, Anti-Smoking Association, and other organs, considering that the two-year drug prohibition period will soon expire, and from New Year's Day next year, drug users should be sentenced to death, and that there are only more than two months left until the end of the year, and drug users may still exist, there should be expanded propaganda to serve as a warning. Therefore, a Shanghai Anti-Drug Propaganda Preparatory Meeting was held at the Garrison Headquarters. Representatives attending included Dai Lizhen from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Cai Bubai from the Municipal Anti-Smoking Committee, Tong Muwan from the City Party Department, Lu Jingshi and Chen Hanzuo from the Garrison Headquarters. Lu Jingshi chaired the meeting and Zhang Bin served as the recorder. After the rituals were performed, the chairman reported that the two-year drug prohibition would soon expire, and from 1937, drug users should be sentenced to death according to law. However, there are still many drug users in Shanghai, so it is planned to hold an expanded anti-drug campaign in the near future to encourage drug users to quit voluntarily. Then the discussion began: (1) The anti-smoking campaign will start on November 10th and end on the 20th. (2) The Garrison Headquarters will issue a notice to warn drug offenders to quit voluntarily. (3) The propaganda materials will be divided into three types: leaflets, slogans, and books, which will be handled by the Municipal Anti-Smoking Committee and the Municipal Public Security Bureau. (4) The distribution of propaganda materials will be handled by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. (5) Broadcasting and lectures will be handled by the City Party Department, which will instruct the Entertainment Association. (6) News propaganda will be handled by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. (7) The estimated cost of printing propaganda materials is 300 yuan, which will be borne jointly by the Municipal Anti-Smoking Committee and the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops - Active Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai have recently shown signs of activity. The number of troops stationed seems to have increased. Although it is impossible to ascertain the exact number, it is estimated to be around 5,000. The storage of military supplies is also abundant. Yesterday, Japanese troops in the North Sichuan Road area were still patrolling in groups and crossing into the city. The dispatch of Japanese troops within the various garrisons was very busy, and their intention seems to be to avoid outside estimates of their numbers. Japanese troops have also been seen in the Shanghai West area from time to time, but they come and go without a fixed schedule. Therefore, the Japanese troops in Shanghai have been active since the Japanese soldier Tian Gang was attacked on September 23rd. To date, their active area has expanded compared to before.</p>

<h3>Two Communists' Anti-Communist Declaration</h3>
<p>Willing to work hard for the rejuvenation of the nation under the banner of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, regarding the surrender of communists Ding Weisheng and Sun Mengfu, specially invited members of the press yesterday at 2 PM. During the meeting, Sun and Ding made anti-communist declarations, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(I) Ding Weisheng (also known as Shuai Changshu): Since the "September 18th" Incident until now, for these full five years, China has encountered unprecedented tribulations, and the national crisis has become increasingly profound, causing every Chinese person to awaken and realize that Japan's invasion of China is not accidental, but based on the entire plan of the Tanaka Memorial. Realizing that Japan's invasion of China will not stop, but intends to completely swallow all of China, the armed invasion of Suiyuan and Chahar, naval exercises in South China, widespread smuggling across the country, and continuous consular meetings and military attache meetings, coupled with the Chengdu Incident, the Beihai Incident, and the Hankou and Shanghai Japanese sailor incidents, provide opportunities for imperialist attacks. This proves that Sino-Japanese relations are currently extremely tense, and the Chinese nation is facing a critical moment of life and death. Since the Chinese nation has reached a critical moment of life and death, there is no doubt that the Chinese nation can only strive for survival with the strength of the entire nation, otherwise it will only perish. Therefore, the rejuvenation of the nation has become the sole task of every Chinese person. Since I have determined that the rejuvenation of the nation is the sole task of every Chinese person, internationalist class struggle is bound to be rejected in China. At a critical moment of national crisis, it is right to use a united front to call on the strength of the entire nation to carry out national salvation work, but to use the united front as a beautiful name and actually engage in class struggle, and to use the slogan of resisting the enemy and saving the country while actually carrying out Soviet work, will inevitably eliminate the strength of the nation and destroy the work of rejuvenating the nation, which is a great crime. I personally am willing to abandon the standpoint of communism and stand on the standpoint of the Chinese nation, under the leadership of the National Government of the Three Principles of the People, and work hard for the rejuvenation of the nation. In the past, between the government and the people, there may have been some differences in form regarding the work of rejuvenating the nation. I believe that this is because the government and the people are in different positions. The government has heavy responsibilities, so it cannot but adopt a steady approach, while the people are driven by righteousness and act violently. However, the people are the foundation of resisting the enemy, and the government is the guide of the people. Coordination between the government and the people can generate great strength, but it must be that the government occupies a leading position, and the people show enthusiasm for support in order to coordinate and generate great strength. The government's determination to resist the enemy and actual preparations are something that every Chinese person should pray for. I hope that the government will give more leadership and education to the people in the future, so that the people can deeply understand the government's policies and unite the strength of the people under the leadership of the government to complete the task of national rejuvenation. I firmly believe that only when the strength of the people is united under the leadership of the government can the task of national rejuvenation be completed. Many Chinese people are still living in a drunken dream. The government should work harder to awaken them and use them for the government. As for preparatory work, it is extremely important. Without preparation, there is absolutely no way to talk about resistance. With the people, with preparation, and with the leadership of the government, resistance has a chance of victory, and the foundation of national rejuvenation can be laid.</p>
<p>(II) Sun Mengfu: I was born at an inauspicious time, in this era of turmoil. In terms of my personal ability and purpose, I am only suitable to be a scholar, quietly exploring to seek the truth. If it were in a society of peace and academic competition, I would have a little something to offer. Unfortunately, I am in this environment, the country is in great difficulty, and misfortunes gather. Especially the September 18th Incident greatly stimulated me, so I was taken in by heresies and mistakenly entered the Communist Party. Afterwards, I knew that it was not suitable for me, but under coercion, I could not extricate myself. Soon I was arrested and imprisoned. In prison, after much pain and reflection, I deeply repented and vowed never to participate in political activities again, and to concentrate on scientific research. Then, even in the current environment, I may be able to achieve something and be of some benefit to the country and society. After being released from prison, I tried my best to abide by this oath and hoped to realize it. However, in the political aspect, I was only passive, unable to grasp the correct center, and unconsciously still retained the poison of the past. Therefore, I was arrested again this time. Now, after clear guidance and a long period of reflection, I feel even more the mistake of blind action in the past, and the lack of thoroughness in avoiding any political relations and not seeking correct leadership. Communism is originally not suitable for a quasi-colonial country like China, and theories such as class struggle are even more sufficient to weaken our own strength and invite foreign troubles in our country. I had already abandoned such fallacies, and now I also see through the roots of the so-called "united front" and "national defense government" various slogans of surface resistance. They are truly a transformation of communist theory, used to agitate the people and usurp orthodoxy. In terms of the current situation, resisting the enemy and saving the country is certainly the first priority, but it must be under the leadership of the government, and only by concentrating national strength can it be effective. Otherwise, there will be division and disintegration, and internal collapse first. How can we resist the enemy? Since the National Revolution, our country has advanced to a country of the Three Principles of the People. Following this correct path, we can develop upward, eliminate all internal and external troubles, and reach a truly free and equal realm. As for other political doctrines and schools, they are all harmful and useless to our country. This can be proven not only in theory, but also verified in fact. Now that I have vowed to reform and start anew, from now on I will do my best under the banner of the Three Principles of the People, be loyal to the party and the country. My sincerity is limited and cannot be fully expressed. I only hope that in future actions, I can show more.</p>

<h3>Lin Kanghou Sponsors the China-Siam Association, Lin Responds in a Letter, Willing to be Listed as a Founding Member, Publishes the Articles of Association Draft</h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central Government, in order to promote friendly relations between China and Siam, initiated the organization of the China-Siam Association. Yesterday, it sent a letter to Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce and Deputy Head of the Siam Inspection Group, to solicit his participation as a founding member. Lin replied in a letter agreeing. The reporter of the Industrial Society explored the letters between the two parties and the draft of the Association's purpose and articles of association as follows:</p>
<p>Soliciting Founding Members</p>
<p>The China-Siam Association sent a letter to Lin Kanghou yesterday to solicit his participation as a founding member. The original letter stated, "Mr. Kanghou, with respect, this Association aims to promote Sino-Siamese culture and develop Sino-Siamese economy. Therefore, we are organizing the 'China-Siam Association' in China and the 'Siam-China Association' in Siam, communicating with each other to strive for greater friendship between the people of the two countries. However, this matter is of great importance and must rely on collective wisdom and effort to succeed. We have long admired your concern and enthusiasm, and dare to borrow your esteemed name as a founding member. If you grant your support, it would be a great honor. We respectfully wish you good fortune. Sincerely, the Preparatory Committee of the China-Siam Association."</p>
<p>Reply Agreeing</p>
<p>After receiving the letter, Lin Kanghou replied yesterday, expressing his agreement. The original letter stated, "In reply, I have just received your letter soliciting my name to be listed as a founding member of the China-Siam Association. I strongly agree and approve to have my name listed as a joint founder. Correspondingly, I reply to your association, hoping that you will check and take note. Sincerely, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, to the Preparatory Committee of the China-Siam Association."</p>
<p>Association's Purpose</p>
<p>China and Siam are both located in the Far East. Geographically, they are neighboring countries, and in terms of bloodlines, they are also mixed. Today's Chinese and Siamese people cannot be distinguished due to centuries of intermarriage. As for the close economic relations and shared international interests, they are also well-known facts. Loving neighbors and being kind to neighbors are famous sayings of Chinese sages and have been regarded as national policies throughout the dynasties. Coexistence and co-prosperity are also China's only foreign policy. In recent years, Siam's diplomacy has also focused on peace and sought coordination. Therefore, China and Siam have the same voice and should strive for further close relations. This should be understood by enlightened people in both countries. We have initiated the China-Siam Association based on this purpose to promote the communication of culture, the development of economy, and the continued increase of national sentiments between the two countries. However, this matter is of great importance and must rely on the support of everyone. Therefore, we are making an appeal and widely soliciting comrades. We hope that great gentlemen will actively participate and jointly accomplish this great cause. Then, it will not only be our good fortune. Sincerely, the Founders of the China-Siam Association.</p>

<h3>Electric Lights in the Six Leitang River South of the County Lighted Up Yesterday</h3>
<p>The electrical business in Puxi, Shanghai County, is undertaken by the Xingshi and Zhenshi Electricity Companies. The area is divided by the Zhuanqiao Six Leitang River. The north of the river belongs to Xingshi, and the south belongs to Zhenshi. Both are supplied with electricity by the Huashang Electricity Company. The areas north of the river were connected to electricity last year. The areas south of the river, Beiqiao, Minhang, Yutang, etc., have also been connected to electricity. The Zhuanqiao area has not been connected due to engineering reasons. Zhuanqiao is the second largest town in Puxi, and industry and commerce are quite developed, so electricity is very much needed. Residents and merchants have repeatedly sent letters to the Zhenshi Company, requesting prompt power supply. Qiao Nianchun, the manager of Zhenshi, has already signed a contract with the Huashang Electricity Company and obtained approval from the Municipal Public Works Bureau. The power was connected yesterday, so it was brightly lit. All electricity on the Shanghai-Kang Road from Wujia Lane south to the Huangpu River was temporarily stopped from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<h3>French Concession Holds Fire Drill</h3>
<p>According to the French-language Shanghai Daily translated by the Foreign News Agency, the fire brigade of the French Concession Public Works Bureau will hold a fire drill in Gujiazhai Garden at 8:00 AM on Saturday, October 31st. It is said that this drill is held once a year.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zuming's Appeal Case Against Zhou Jinggeng et al. Was Judged Yesterday, Gao Yushu et al.'s Perjury Not Accepted, Zhang's Incidental Civil Appeal Rejected</h3>
<p>Zhou Jinggeng, the former comprador of the Xue Mailuo Accounting Firm at No. 9 Edward Road in the French Concession, sent his partners Gao Yushu, Feng Ti, and Wan Guirong on the afternoon of June 9, 1934, to the China Industrial Bank to withdraw 18,000 yuan in cash back to the firm. Not long after, a thief broke in and robbed 12,000 yuan. He reported to the French Police, and the detectives arrested suspects Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Jimeng, Zai Lianyou, and Tang Qingyue and sent them to the Second Special Court for public prosecution. After trial, it was found that there was no solid evidence of crime by Zhang, Zhuang, Zai, and Tang, and they were acquitted. The case was appealed to the Higher Third Branch and the Supreme Court, and the three trials concluded with the original judgment being upheld. Later, Zhang Zuming hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the criminal division of the Second Special Court against Zhou Jinggeng, Gao Yushu, Feng Ti, Wan Guirong, Qian Genghua, Wang Guirong, etc., for perjury and false accusation, and incidentally filed a civil suit, seeking compensation for damages of 50,000 yuan. After trial, the court ruled that Zhou Jinggeng and the other six were not guilty, and the incidental civil suit was rejected. Zhang Zuming was not satisfied with the original judgment and filed an appeal with the Higher Third Branch. The Higher Court opened a collegial panel a few days ago to summon both parties for trial and announced the end of the debate, awaiting the scheduled official judgment. This has been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday afternoon was the date of the judgment. Neither the appellant nor the appellees nor their lawyers reported. At 3:30 PM, Criminal Division Chief Wu Tingqi and Assessors Liao and Wang went to the Criminal Third Court to deliver the judgment. The main text stated, "The original judgment is revoked with respect to the parts concerning Gao Yushu, Feng Ti, Wan Guirong, Qian Genghua, and Wang Guirong. The continuous perjury of Gao Yushu, Feng Ti, Wan Guirong, Qian Genghua, and Wang Guirong is not accepted. The rest of the appeal is rejected." Also, Zhang Zuming's incidental civil appeal is rejected.</p>
<h3>The Trunk Murder Case Was Concluded Yesterday, Lin Gendi Examined and Found No Mental Illness, Mao A'gen et al. Still Insist on Being Framed, Court Orders Judgment on the Fifth of Next Month</h3>
<p>In the headless trunk murder case, during the last court session, the defense lawyers Fan Gang and Shen Xiaoxiang for the defendants Mao A'gen and Jiang Yuantan requested that the blood on the floorboards and the blood stains left on the rattan box used to hold the corpse be determined to be of the same type, and that Lin Gendi be examined for mental illness. Therefore, the hearing was postponed. The First Special Court has now sent the case to the Institute of Forensic Medicine for examination. The results showed that Lin Gendi did not have any mental illness, and whether the blood on the floorboards and the blood on the rattan box were of the same type could not be determined because of the long time and the lime.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, this case was continued by Judge Zhong Qing of the First Special Court and Prosecutor Zhang Zongru. Police Lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that, during the postponement, Ye Kuiyu, the manager of the Cunfu Lane house at a certain number, was re-summoned by the police. According to Ye, on the afternoon of August 3rd of this year, two women went to Cunfu Lane to rent a house, but they thought the rent of over 30 yuan was too expensive and did not rent it. They also went to a certain number one, but the rent of 25 yuan was not agreed upon. The two women were about twenty years old, five feet three inches tall, with short hair, wearing</p>
<p>Black and blue cheongsams</p>
<p>with white trim. The other was about twenty years old, five feet two inches tall, and seemed to have a Ningbo accent. They had considered renting the pavilion room at number two. According to Ye, it was not rented to them. Now Ye is also in court, please question him. Then Ye Kuiyu submitted a report on the previous situation. The court asked whether the number two of Cunfu Lane had been rented out. Ye answered that it had not been rented out. If he was lying, he would willingly be punished. Then Hua Detective Huang Fosen submitted a report on the investigation of Ye Kuiyu. The court immediately questioned Lin Gendi, who provided, the deceased was determined to be Cai Ying, killed by Jiang Yuanying when Mao was also at the scene, the date was August 9th at 2 PM, I</p>
<p>Actually didn't do it</p>
<p>etc. Mao A'gen said that this was a slander by Lin. On August 9th, I and the firefighters from certain numbers competed in volleyball with the firemen from a few different numbers, and after the game, we had dinner, and I never left the fire station. Jiang Yuanying also insisted that he was framed. The court, considering the facts clear, ordered the opening of debate. Then, Police Lawyer Zhang started by saying,</p>
<p>This case was solved</p>
<p>because someone reported it, not because the police arrested them on their own initiative. Lin Gendi unintentionally mentioned it to someone at the cigarette shop on Carter Road on September 2nd, which led to the solution. If Lin intended to frame someone, he could have reported it to the police. Moreover, the examination showed that Lin had no mental illness, and his testimony was consistent from beginning to end, without any confusion. Jiang Yuanta first admitted it, according to his confession, the reason for killing Cai Ying was due to jealousy and love rivalry. And they all confessed during the on-site inspection in court, so</p>
<p>Criminal facts</p>
<p>are very clear and should be judged according to law. Fan Gang and Shen Xiaoxiang then argued for the defendants, regarding this case, until now, it is still unknown who the murderer is. Although according to Lin Gendi's confession, the deceased was Cai Ying, who lived at number 10 of Cunfu Lane, the investigation showed that there was no Cai Ying in number two of that lane. The date of the murder Lin originally said was August 8th, but after the police investigation it showed that Mao A'gen was at the fire station all day on that day, so it was changed to August 8th. Moreover, one of the female attendants of the Yangzhou troupe of the Daxin Company</p>
<p>Named Zhu Fenglan</p>
<p>and not Cai Ying. Furthermore, Lin Gendi's confessions were contradictory and none were credible and should be announced innocent. The court then gave the forensic report on the autopsy by Zhang Yan of the First Special Court to the lawyers of both parties to read. It was said that the corpse changed particularly slowly when the body lost all of its blood and its moisture decreased. The time for the corpse to decompose could last up to eighteen hours, so the deceased was about fifty hours after death when she was examined. The court then designated Fan Lawyer to be Lin Gendi's</p>
<p>Defense under</p>
<p>Zhang Prosecutor's opinion, said that during the autopsy, it was found that the head and legs were cut very smoothly, and those who were not accustomed to knife and axe work could not have such skills. Now, the defendants Mao and Jiang in this case were firefighters, and their daily work involved the use of axes, so the situation was consistent. Lin Gendi's confession was consistent, and Jiang Yuantan initially admitted it in court. Moreover, the police checked the axe used by the defendants, so his confession should be adopted. Now that there is a crime scene and evidence in this case, it should be considered that there is evidence and a judgment should be made according to law. Judge Zhong then announced the end of the debate, and set the sentence to be announced at 10 AM on the 5th of next month.</p>
<h3>Dr. Haile Gave a Speech Yesterday</h3>
<p>American fisheries expert Dr. Haile, accompanied by Hou Chaohai, a technician from the Ministry of Industry, visited Mr. Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Fish Market, at the Zhonghui Building at 11:00 AM yesterday to inquire about the organization and operation of the fish market in detail. The doctor expressed his appreciation for Mr. Du's enthusiasm in running the market and talked about the situation of fish markets in the East. He said that Shanghai has a large scale, and if it can expand its business, it can become the only large fish market south of Shanghai. At 12:00, the doctor went to the Xinya Hotel on Nanjing Road and attended a public banquet hosted by the Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries School, the Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries Experimental Farm, and the Zhejiang Provincial Fisheries Experimental Farm. Later, accompanied by Zhang Chuqing, the principal of the Fisheries School, and Chen Tongbai, the director of the Zhejiang Provincial Fisheries Experimental Farm, he visited the Wusong Fisheries School and invited the doctor to give an academic speech in the school's auditorium. All the staff and students of the school attended the lecture, which was titled "The Position of the Fishery Industry in the National Economy." The lecture lasted more than an hour, and at the end, he encouraged the students to work hard on fisheries research in order to develop the country's resources. In the evening, Technician Hou hosted a banquet for the doctor at the YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge, and invited Pan Gongzhan, Wu Huanru, Huang Renzhi, Jiang Wenyu, Liu Zhanen, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Huang Yanfang, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, and dozens of others to accompany him. It was a lively gathering, and the guests and hosts dispersed in joy until about 8:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Three Employees of Wing On Company Accused of Colluding to Defraud, Getting Meal Money by Having Ministers Sign Notes, Erasing Lead Words to Fraudulently Claim Refunded Goods</h3>
<p>Ningbo native Chen Dingan, Ying Lingeng, Shanghai native Shi Jie-feng, etc., have been working as employees in the furniture department of Wing On Company on Nanjing Road for many years. Recently, the company authorities found that Chen and others had colluded to defraud money and property, so they reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station the day before yesterday afternoon, ordering Detective He Renrui to arrest Chen, Ying, and Wang successively, and searched out 135 yuan in stolen money and a forged note, and took them to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Qian Xunwan filed a lawsuit against Chen Dingan for fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Law.</p>
<p>File an Appeal</p>
<p>Ying and Wang were requested to be detained because the evidence had not yet been fully investigated. Lawyer Qian also stated the circumstances of the prosecution, saying that the defendant Chen Dingan has been working in the furniture department of the company for 11 years, and his monthly salary is 21 yuan. Ying Lingeng has been employed for six years, and his monthly salary is 11 yuan. All the company's department employees are provided with meals and accommodation, but if they are busy with work and have no time to eat, they can write a note and ask the department minister to sign it, and receive</p>
<p>Meal money of four corners</p>
<p>On the 25th of this month, Chen Dingan, an employee of the furniture department, wrote a note as usual because he did not have time to eat, and asked the department minister, Guo Wenhui, a Cantonese, to sign it. Unexpectedly, Chen had ulterior motives. After the minister signed it, he erased the pencil writing on the note with a rubber, leaving only the minister's signature on it. He then wrote in ink, "Please hand over one customer-returned electrical table mat, totaling 135 yuan," etc. Chen then took the note to the company</p>
<p>General accounting office</p>
<p>to receive the money. The accounting office, seeing that there was the minister's signature, handed over the money in full. But at this time, General Manager Lin An was on the fourth floor. After seeing the note, he thought that this kind of refund procedure was not so simple and was suspicious. He then inquired with Guo Wenhui, the minister of the furniture department, and learned that there was no such thing. He then detained Chen Dingan and reported to the police station, ordering Detective Qian Lin to investigate. According to Chen's confession, the fraud</p>
<p>was not just once</p>
<p>and that his colleagues Ying Lingeng.</p>
<p>Wang Jie-gui, was also cooperating, so Ying and Wang were arrested in succession. Now the police are requesting a postponement to facilitate the investigation of another case because the investigation procedures have not yet been completed. Furthermore, according to Guo Wenhui, the minister of the furniture department, it has now been found that the defendants have concocted various pretexts and used this method to defraud money and property in as many as five or six cases. Judge Ye Shengchao briefly questioned Chen and others and ordered them to be detained pending a re-trial in seven days.</p>
<h3>Forgery of Bank of Communications Notes: Fu Yi Accused of Conspiracy; Fu Consistently Denies Forgery, Claiming Purchase from Guangdong; Court to Announce Verdict Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Guangdong native Fu Yi, accused of removing the bank name and train emblem from eighteen one-yuan banknotes of the Bank of Communications, then scorching the areas around the removals and exchanging them for new notes at the bank. Recently, many instances have been discovered on the market of using waste paper from other provinces to patch up the bank name and train emblem of Bank of Communications notes, passing them off as genuine notes. As a result, the General Inspectorate of the Police Department instructed detectives Kang Zengxiang and Sun Jishan to arrest Fu. A search of Fu's residence uncovered tens of thousands of Guangdong Provincial Bank notes (already unusable). He was brought before the First Special District Court. Fu consistently denied forging the Bank of Communications notes with waste paper from other provinces. The court adjourned the hearing for further investigation. Details have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide conducted a further hearing in the criminal court. First, Sun Jiasheng, an employee of the Shenyi Money Exchange on Jiangxi Road, testified that Fu usually traded in public bonds and bought Guangdong Provincial Bank notes. At the end of last month, Fu had received 9,000 yuan in Guangdong Provincial Bank notes from the exchange, bringing the total received to around 40,000 yuan. Subsequently, Xu Yuanlai, an employee of the Issuing Department of the Bank of Communications, testified that two years ago, the Kao Zhen Preserved Meat Shop at 688 North Sichuan Road had exchanged one-yuan banknotes of the bank with the train emblem and bank name burned out. At the time, the intention behind the removal was unknown, so the police were notified to investigate, but there were no leads. It was only after the discovery of forged notes on the market that the reason became clear, leading to Fu's arrest when he came to exchange notes. Questioned, Fu Yi stated that he had purchased these Bank of Communications one-yuan notes in Guangdong two years ago and denied any forgery. He hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. After an exchange between police lawyer Li Zhishan and lawyer Fan, Judge Feng declared the hearing closed, scheduling the verdict for this Saturday.</p>
<h3>Japanese Chamber of Commerce: Unable to Proceed</h3>
<p>Due to Opposition from Chinese People</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that recently, rumors have spread in Shanghai that Japanese merchants are actively preparing to revive the Chamber of Commerce, attempting to disrupt China's financial system. According to a journalist's inquiry to relevant parties, Japanese merchants Uda Goro and others established a Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai during the sixth and seventh years of the Republic (1917-1918), which later profited greatly before being suspended. For nearly a decade, Japanese businesses in Shanghai have not been performing as well as before. Some Japanese merchants, seeing the potential for profit in the Chamber of Commerce, approached leaders of the Chinese business community in the city a month ago to discuss the revival of the Chamber of Commerce. However, due to strong opposition from the Chinese people and lack of cooperation, the effort has now been suspended.</p>

<h3>Labor Strike at Shanghai West Silk Weaving Factories: Result of Party and Government Mediation</h3>
<p>Work Expected to Resume This Morning</p>
<p>A Dagong News Agency report states that workers from six silk weaving factories in Shanghai West—Baohua, Tiancheng, Fuxing, Yucun, Yongfeng, and Yiyou—recently jointly launched an industry union. Tiancheng and Baohua factories dismissed eleven preparatory members, including Lu Shaocheng, causing worker dissatisfaction. A conflict erupted with guards and staff at the Yucun factory, leading to seventeen arrests. Workers at all factories went on strike yesterday, sending representatives to party and government agencies to request assistance. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Strike Petition</p>
<p>The six silk weaving factories, Baohua and Tiancheng, employ more than 1,200 male and female workers. Because of the launch of the union, Tiancheng factory dismissed four preparatory members, including Lu Shaocheng, Zhang Xianguang, Chen Zaizhu, and Zhu Xiaozhong. Baohua factory also dismissed seven preparatory members, including Xu Housheng, Zhou Xian'e, Zhou Ju'e, Huang Heqin, Zhang Yuezhen, Zhu Shengrong, and Zhang Baixi, eleven in total. This caused outrage among the workers. The afternoon before yesterday, at 5 pm, they went to the Baohua factory to demand reinstatement, but to no avail. Passing by the Yucun factory, workers there heard the call and rushed out to respond, leading to a clash with guards and staff at the Yucun factory, with injuries on both sides. The Caojiadu Public Security Bureau arrested seventeen workers. Yesterday morning, workers from all factories gathered in Shanghai West and held a meeting, unanimously deciding to strike and sending sixty representatives, including Xu Longsheng, Chen Rongcan, Wang Jingxiang, and Wang Baisong, to party and government agencies to request assistance. Arriving at the Fenglin Bridge Municipal Party Headquarters around 9 am, they were received by Li Weixiong of the Civil Movement Section, who, after inquiring about the situation, advised the workers to wait quietly for a legal resolution. They then went to the Social Affairs Bureau of the Central District of the city, where they were received by Wang Xianqing, the Mediation Director of the Second Section, who gave a satisfactory response. They dispersed around 1 pm.</p>
<p>Six Demands</p>
<p>After implementing a joint strike, the workers presented six demands at yesterday's general meeting, seeking mediation from party and government agencies: (1) Immediately release the arrested workers, including Zhang Baixi (2) The medical expenses of all injured workers should be borne by the Yucun factory, which is the capitalist side (3) Injured workers should be paid their wages during the injury period (4) Order the capitalists from Baohua and Yiyou factories to withdraw the dismissal orders and allow Zhang Baixi and others to return to work (5) Factory capitalists must guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again in the future (6) If the incident is delayed and cannot be resolved, wages should still be paid during the work stoppage.</p>
<p>Party and Government Mediation</p>
<p>After receiving reports from Baohua and the other six silk factories, the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau determined that the joint strike was highly related to local security and the future of the industry and the workers’ livelihood, so the Municipal Party Headquarters sent Li Weixiong, and the Social Affairs Bureau sent He Jingyuan, to investigate the truth at various factories in Shanghai West. However, because the workers insisted that the arrested workers must be released before further negotiations could take place, the party and government representatives went to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to discuss the issue and decided that the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions would be responsible for bailing out the seventeen arrested workers, including Zhang Baixi. Future issues would be resolved legally. In the afternoon at about 4:00 PM they summoned representatives of the various factory workers to talk, advised about the pros and cons, and advised the workers to resume work first, and the six conditions requested would be settled on a scheduled, lawful basis. Representatives of each of the workers indicated their acceptance, promising to explain to all workers the command to return to work, but because it was late there wasn't enough time to inform all workers of the factory, therefore they could go to the factory and resume work this morning.</p>

<h3>Detectives Disguised as Merchants: Nine Notorious Thieves Arrested; Firearms and Stolen Goods Confiscated; All Thieves Detained for Further Interrogation</h3>
<p>Between September 9th and October 21st, two residences at 17, Lane 53, Ruijin Road, and 10, Lane 366, Tangshan Road, were invaded by large gangs of notorious thieves who used firearms to intimidate and silence the occupants, stealing valuables worth several hundred yuan before fleeing without a trace. Reports were filed with the police for investigation and arrest. Around 7 am the day before yesterday, Shao Jingfan, a Chinese detective at the Jiaxing Road Police Station, learned that the bandits involved in these two cases were meeting at Room 11 in the Xizang Hotel at 10 Yu Qiaqing Road to plot the theft of a large sum of money from a certain residence. He collaborated with detectives Yang Xinzheng and Chen Lusheng, secretly booking Room 16 and disguising themselves as merchants to observe the situation. The gang of thieves had not yet returned. Detective Shao and Detective Black Deng from the Western District waited on the street. At 3 pm, they saw a large group of thieves entering the hotel one after another. Without making a sound, they continued to wait. After a while, the ringleaders, Wang Laoshan and Zhang Shaokang, both from Shaoxing, and their accomplices Cheng Yuan and Zhang Xianggen, staggered in. They were immediately arrested. A White Langlin pistol and sixteen bullets were found on Wang Laoshan and Zhang Shaokang. In Room 31, they found five more people: Lin Zhongfa from Ningbo, Sun Yonglin from Hangzhou, Chen Bingde and Wang Guiyuan from Shaoxing, and a woman from Hangzhou named Zhao Ji. Zhao Ji's waistband held a white satin ribbon, which was identified as stolen property by the victim of the Tangshan Road robbery. It had been given to her by Sun Yonglin. They also went to the Kangti Road No. 410 pawn shop in the French Concession and retrieved a stolen watch, which was brought to the police station along with the others for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Bureau of Public Works, detailed the case and requested an extension for further investigation. Detective Shao then explained the process of arresting the defendants, presenting the seized guns and watch ribbon. Judge Zhong Qing questioned the nine men and women, and ordered them to be detained for further investigation.</p>

<p>The case of lawyer Bao Gang, accused by Cui Changgui, a chauffeur from the Special Affairs Group of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, of seducing his fiancée Yang Yuehua, hiding her in the home of Zhang Qinghong, the chief of the Third District of Chuansha, and instigating a divorce, has been prosecuted by the District Court, with Bao Gang and his tea attendant Zhang Xinkui accused of being intermediaries. The District Court has repeatedly ordered further investigation. The Commissioner of the Jiangsu Supervisory Office also dispatched a special investigator to review the case. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xie of the District Court continued the hearing. Bao Gang claimed illness and did not appear. Zhang Xinkui was brought from detention for questioning. First, witness Zhang Yao, a 31-year-old resident of Xiaowan, Chuansha, was questioned. "Zhang Qinghong is my husband. Bao Gang, my husband's classmate, brought a woman, Yang Yuehua, to stay for one or two weeks. Bao left after bringing her. Yang Yuehua came to Shanghai three or four days later and then again for two days. My husband and I were together. Yang's husband came looking for her. The official showed a photo and asked if the person in the male attire was me and the person in the female attire was Yang Yuehua. According to Bao, she was Bao's concubine. I called her 'Mrs. Bao' out of politeness and didn't press further. Later, as we became closer, I also called her 'Sister-in-law.' Bao Gang didn't come often, but he would come to my husband if he needed something. Yang Yuehua lived next door. This is the truth." After making a sworn statement, she was asked if she had ever seen Bao's wife. She replied that she had not. Then, witness Fang Wanru and others were questioned. Fang stated that he/she was a room attendant at the Fang Gui Hotel and did not remember anything about opening rooms for (…). He/She also did not pay close attention to Yang Yuehua's appearance. As for Room 322 on May 11th, he/she heard that it was opened by someone surnamed Zhou. He/She also said that the room was managed by the conductor Zhou Ming (?). Then, Yang Yuehua, 21 years old, from Pinghu, formerly residing at Jiezhufang, Penglai Road, currently residing at Fumin Road, testified that she went to Bao's house on May 10th after arguing with her husband, and went to the Grand Eastern Hotel on May 11th. However, she did not remember whether it was Room 321 or Room 332. She did not recognize the two tea attendants, and had not opened a room since then. However, for three days, the 13th, 14th, and 15th, Zhang Xinkui called her three times to go to Bao's place, but she did not want to go. Asked, "Since you didn't want to go, how did you go with him?" She answered evasively and said that she went to Zhang Qinghong's place in Chuansha on the 19th for over a month and was far away from the district. She pointed to Yao and identified her as Zhang Qinghong's wife, who called her "Sister-in-law." Later she went to Shanghai, staying at the Jiangsu Reception Hall and then Nantian. Bao smoked opium and did not get up in the morning. Zhang Xinkui was his confidant. Then, Cui Changgui testified, "Since my wife disappeared, I have been burning incense and praying to the gods. Later, my wife's friend Zhang Jinhua told me, and I understood the situation. Please investigate," etc. Then, Zhang Xinkui testified in court, still claiming that he was being framed. The official adjourned the hearing for further questioning, and Zhang Xinkui was returned to detention.</p>

<h3>Chinese Industrial Bank Held Creditors' Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Meditates Reconciliation: Resolved to Petition the Court for Instructions</p>
<p>Since the China Industrial Bank suspended operations in October 1934, although the court declared liquidation and bankruptcy, no solution has been reached for more than a year. Recently, Lu Jingxing and others, in accordance with the law, requested the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to mediate reconciliation and submitted a reconciliation plan. The Chamber held a creditors' meeting in the auditorium yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Because creditors had differing opinions, the meeting was quite chaotic. It was decided to submit the voting results to the court for review. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Situation</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM, creditors arrived one after another and signed in. First, Ke Ganchen, a standing committee member of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, announced that more than three-quarters of the creditors were present, so the meeting could be convened in accordance with the law. He reported that Lu Jingxing and others, partners of the China Industrial Bank, had requested the Chamber to mediate reconciliation based on the registered claims of Lu Xihou, the transferee of the China Industrial Bank, who was bankrupt. Accountant Xi Yushu reported on the review of the accounts at the office of bankruptcy administrator Xu Yongzuo. After the reconciliation plan was read, the creditors rose to speak one after another. The main points can be divided into (1) questioning the Chamber's legal basis for mediating reconciliation, (2) what capacity do Lu Jingxing, Tu Bao Yi, and Ji Zong (?) request reconciliation, and has their personal property been audited, and (3) although past attempts at reconciliation had failed to return any deposits, they supported reconciliation by the Chamber, and (4) the previous proposal to return 20% of the deposits, while the current reconciliation plan only returns ten percent, which is illegal and should be opposed. Each held to their reasons, and the scene became chaotic.</p>
<p>Vote</p>
<p>Chairman Ke Ganchen explained that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce was completely neutral and that creditors could vote to support or oppose the reconciliation. If two-thirds of the votes supported reconciliation in accordance with the bankruptcy law, then the remaining one-quarter would be bound by it. If three-quarters supported ordinary reconciliation, then the creditors could still pursue litigation and would not be bound by it. However, the above decisions would still need to be presented to the First Special District Court for explanation before proceeding. The creditors then voted, and three representatives were publicly elected to verify the votes on the stage. To ensure accuracy, the vote was handed over to accountant Xi Yushu for detailed review. After explaining to the creditors, Chairman Ke Ganchen announced the adjournment.</p>
<p>Reconciliation Plan</p>
<p>The reconciliation plan proposed by Lu Jingxing, Tu Qi Yi, and Li Zong Sui is as follows: (1) All debts of the China Industrial Bank, based on the registered amount in the bankruptcy proceedings of the China Industrial Bank and Lu Xihou, will be borne by Lu Jingxing and others, who will raise 10% of the outstanding debt (i.e., 10%) in cash within 30 days from the date of reconciliation, as settlement of the responsibilities of Lu Xihou, Lu Jingxing, Li Zong Sui, and Tu Bin Yi. (2) The cash will be borne by Liu Chunpu, Jin Yangtian, Chen Shizhen, and others. (3) Three representatives elected by the creditors will, together with Lu Jingxing and others, liquidate, collect, and dispose of the assets of the China Industrial Bank and Lu Xihou. After deducting necessary expenses, if there is a surplus after paying the 10%, the surplus will be distributed proportionally to the creditors, but only up to a total of 20% (including the first 10%). If there is any further surplus, it will be enjoyed by Lu Xihou and has nothing to do with the creditors. (4) This reconciliation releases Lu Xihou, Lu Jingxing, Ji Zong Sui, and Tu Bin Yi from responsibility, but the creditors still have the right to seek compensation for the amount not received from other responsible persons of the China Industrial Bank. To preserve the rights of the creditors, they may entrust their representatives to exercise the right of subrogation and may file lawsuits or non-litigation actions in the name of the bank, Lu Xihou, or the creditors' representatives.</p>
<h3>Tofu Industry Commemorates the King of Huainan Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Qiaojiazhai Shanghai Tofu Industry Association held a celebration yesterday in commemoration of their industry ancestor, King Liu An of Huainan. The event was unprecedented in its grandeur. The details are summarized below:</p>
<p>Celebrating the Industry Ancestor</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Tofu Industry Association, located at 18 Qiaojiazhai, held a celebration in commemoration of the anniversary of the death of their industry ancestor, King Liu An of Huainan. Beginning at 9 am, more than 200 industry members, including Wei Jinsheng, Zhang Fugen, Han Wenjun, Qiu Senlin, and Ni Fengxiang, attended. In the afternoon, a Western-style religious ceremony was held, and in the evening, industry members gathered for a meal to celebrate the occasion solemnly.</p>
<p>Anecdotes about Liu An</p>
<p>King Liu An of Huainan, whose surname was Liu and given name was An, was a native of Huainan who lived during the Later Han dynasty. He was the 18th generation descendant of Emperor Gaozu Liu Bang. His father, Zhi, had only one son. When the King of Huainan was fourteen years old, his mother's teeth deteriorated due to old age, making it difficult for her to eat hard foods. Sometimes, she could not find suitable food to swallow. The King of Huainan was extremely filial. Seeing this, he worked hard to research soft foods to help his mother eat. Soon, he unintentionally invented tofu, which has been passed down to this day. There are more than 700 families in this city who make a living from the tofu industry.</p>
<h3>Western Police Prevent Firefighting: Shantytown Representatives Petition</h3>
<p>Request Thorough Investigation and Permission to Build; Municipal Federation Agrees to Forward to Bureau of Public Works</p>
<p>Shantytown residents of Linqing Road in the Pudong district report that due to carelessness at 2:30 pm on the 25th of this month, a fire broke out. The fire engines arrived to help. A local police authority, however, prevented the firefighters from extinguishing the blaze. Fire spread rapidly, burning down 48 houses and displacing 430 people. Luckily, the Chinese Jisheng Association provided each household with 96 yuan to prevent starvation. The victims spent the night among the rubble, only to be driven away by Yangshupu police, causing great suffering. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 pm, representatives Wu Yunluan, Wang Naide, Fu Xiangyin, and Tang Qingquan, along with the Shanghai East Shantytown Association representatives Yu Qitai, Tang Anping, Shen Changgui, Shen Zhaocheng, Hong Jincheng, and Qin Wenzhi, went to the Municipal Federation Shantytown Association to petition. They made two requests: (1) Thoroughly investigate the Western police who prevented the firefighters from extinguishing the fire; (2) With the exception of 10 households that cannot afford to build, request that the Bureau of Public Works allow the reconstruction of the 38 shanties. Chen Jiufeng, the executive committee member and consultant to the Shantytown Association, received them and agreed to forward the report to the Bureau of Public Works. They were satisfied. The group resolved to convene a Shanghai East District group leaders meeting at 2:00 PM tomorrow afternoon to discuss the aftermath.</p>

<h3>A.E.G. Celebrates Longevity for Shou Linwen</h3>
<p>Electrical engineer Shou Linwen has been working at A.E.G. China Electrical Factory for 25 years. On the 30th of this month, the factory's Shanghai office, under the order of the German headquarters, held a celebration for Shou. A banquet was held at the New Asia Hotel. Shou is amiable and highly valued by the factory. In 1909, Shou was sent to the German headquarters for a five-year internship, mainly in factories producing steam turbines, generators, switches, motors, sheds, and electric meters. Finally, he briefly interned in more than ten other manufacturing plants one by one. He returned to China during the outbreak of the European War, and the representative in China was repatriated. Therefore, Shou was put in charge of the affairs in China. At that time, there were several steam turbine generators that had been sold but not yet installed. Shou alone took on the completion and installation. He is a rare talent in electrical engineering.</p>
<h3>He Xiuwen Sues Yang Tianyu; Identity Should be Confirmed First</h3>
<p>Yang Tianyu, the former director of the Fujian Anti-Opium Bureau, once lived with a woman named He Xiuwen and had a child. Recently, He filed a criminal self-accusation with the First Special District Local Court, alleging that Yang had abandoned her. After repeated summons, the defendant failed to appear in court, so the case was adjourned. Yesterday afternoon, the case was heard again by Judge Fu, but the defendant still failed to appear. The plaintiff requested an arrest warrant. The judge stated that it has not yet been proven whether He's child was fathered by Yang, and therefore it would be inappropriate to issue an arrest warrant. The issue of the child's identity should be determined by the civil court. Therefore, the judge ruled to suspend the case and instructed He Xiuwen to seek identity confirmation from the civil court before the case can be further processed.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern: I have just read a news item in your newspaper's news column on the 29th of this month, stating that the Municipal Party Headquarters is preparing to celebrate Chairman Chiang's birthday, and that a recreational gathering will be held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, etc. It is true that there was a proposal to hold a recreational gathering to celebrate Chairman Chiang's birthday, but due to the Central Government's order to suspend birthday celebrations during this period of national crisis, the recreational gathering scheduled for the evening at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been cancelled, except for a party members' meal. I hereby inform you of this and hope you will check and correct it. Sincerely, Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, October 29.</p>
<p>To whom it may concern: In today's edition of the local news on the 28th, there is a report on the case of lawyer Bao Gang being accused of seduction. It states that Zhang Qinghong, the chief of Chuansha District, was instructed to ask the county magistrate to investigate, and that deceiving me is deceiving the Control Yuan and deceiving the Party is being a reactionary element. This is not consistent with the wording of the interrogation at the time. Zhang, as a public official, should abide by the law, and even if he wants to deceive me, he cannot deceive the Control Yuan. If he deceives the Party, he will be an unfaithful element. I said that even if there is no instruction to the county to investigate, the office can order the county to thoroughly investigate, etc. Please correct this immediately to avoid misunderstandings. Sincerely, Wu Zhang, Secretary of the Jiangsu Control Commissioner's Office, October 28.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Fabric Sales Sluggish; Yarn Market Price Increase Also Flattens; Many Bulls Cutting Losses</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the afternoon after a morning decline, and the situation is still calm. As the price has fallen for several consecutive days, the number is already considerable, and it should be able to stabilize. However, the demand for yarn is still sluggish, so people's hearts are scattered. One merchant has already cut half of his large position. Most people do not see much upside in yarn in the near term. The price of Osaka Sanpin yarn for the near month is 16-17 yuan higher than the distant month.</p>
<p>Tendered Yarn Drops Near Term, Rises Far Term</p>
<p>The tendered yarn market opened in the morning. Because of poor sales of yarn, people's confidence was weakened, and the price continued to fall by 1.5 yuan. The distant month, however, rose by 0.7-0.8 yuan to 1 yuan. In the first session, the near month rose again by 1.7 yuan, and the distant month returned by 0.5-0.6 yuan. By the time of the third closing, it was heard that yarn sales were still thin, and many floating buyers cut their losses. The market declined. As a result, the November price was 1.4 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price, and the distant month was 0.4-0.7 yuan lower. The market opened slightly lower in the afternoon by 0.1 yuan in the near month, but the distant month turned firm. The second session rose again due to rising raw cotton prices. The third closing heard that yarn transactions were lacking, and the momentum was stable. As a result, each month rose by 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 0.9 yuan to 1.3 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Hengyi sold 2,900 bales, Tongji 800 bales, Mingde 1,800 bales, Changyu 2,800 bales, Huamao 2,900 bales, Fengtai 5,750 bales, Renfeng 800 bales, Yichang 1,000 bales, Dachang 1,500 bales.

<h3>Cotton Price Decline Stabilizes Slightly</h3>
<p>The cotton market rose in the afternoon after a morning decline. This is because foreign cotton is weak, demand for real cotton is not strong, and old, coarse cotton is still stuck in November and December. However, compared to the high price on the 21st, it has already fallen sharply by 3.7-0.8 yuan. It may temporarily stabilize. In the afternoon, there were rumors that there were still problems with the delivery of October cotton. People's confidence was restored. In fact, the degree of decline was too severe, so a rebound is possible.</p>
<p>Tendered Cotton Falls in Morning, Recovers in Afternoon</p>
<p>The tendered cotton market opened in the morning. As the decline was violent the previous day, the momentum stabilized slightly. Prices recovered by 0.1-0.3 yuan in each month. The first session turned soft, and the third session fell again. Because one merchant drastically cut their long positions and went short, the market became loose. By the time of closing, the distant month had fallen sharply by 0.35 yuan. The situation was very bad. As a result, each month fell by 0.25-0.4 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The market opened suddenly nervous in the afternoon. Each month fell sharply by 0.3-0.4 yuan. The second session suddenly fell by 0.2-0.3 yuan. By the third closing, it had recovered again.

<h3>American Cotton Merchants Awaiting Election Results; Cotton Prices Weaken Again by Closing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened. The Liverpool news was not good. Colleagues and foreign merchants bought, short positions covered, and each month rose by 1-3 points. There was less short selling. Cooperatives bought the December position at a limit price. Weekly weather reports were favorable for the harvesting of new cotton. Actual demand was active, and the basis for high-grade cotton was very firm. New buyers were normal. Everyone was waiting for the election results. Cooperative short selling increased, and market prices weakened again. The spot price fell by 4 points, and futures fell by 4-7 points. British cotton spot prices rose by 12 points, and futures rose by 3-5 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to large purchases by European exporters, but then fell back as long positions were liquidated.

<h3>Piece Goods, Cotton Cloth Market Difficult to Sustain; Various Places Telegraphing to Stop Shipping; Transactions Suddenly Become Desolate</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market continued to soften due to the continued softening of the yarn and cotton market. Cloth factories were not worried about the scarcity of yarn and thread, and the selling price became cheaper every day. The customer groups that were recently selling well, such as Changsha, Hankou, Jiujiang, Wuhu, Yunnan, Fujian, Guangdong, and other regions, have recently become cheaper in Shanghai, and there is no confirmed market price. Because the true situation is difficult to understand, all goods have fallen unanimously. People's hearts are very empty, and all customer groups have telegraphed and sent letters, all saying that local market prices have fallen, adding to the goods, and asking them to stop loading, or sell them in Shanghai. Therefore, the market is quiet and the market is difficult to sustain. Yesterday, 16-pound coarse cloth hand goods were competing to sell off. Zhentai Factory's Hongfu brand, Baoxing Factory's Baoxing brand, Shenxin Factory's Ren Zhong brand, as well as Saima, Gengyu, and Bianlong brands, all fell (per piece) by 1.3 yuan or so. However, Yihua Factory's various grades of coarse cloth still maintained the original price. Eastern goods fine cloth continued to fall (per piece) by about 0.1 yuan. Shanghai cloth, 84 original cloth, also fell (per piece) by 0.05 yuan. The transaction was very desolate. Only fine twill was still stable because of good demand. Colored goods, real tribute, flannel, broadcloth, printed flannel, and other goods also slightly fell (per yard) by 0.0025-0.005 yuan. Natural color twill flannel and white lining flannel are extremely scarce on the market, and the allocation of goods is not strong, so the market is quite firm.</p>
<h3>Yuanfang Piece Goods Rebound Also Starts</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the date of the 3,012th auction by Yuanfang Foreign Firm, displaying five types of goods: Western satin, Yuan velvet, tribute flannel, Yuan silk, and foreign red cloth, totaling 49 brands in 99 boxes. The market was stagnant for customer groups because the previous period was suspended due to the situation. In the following two periods, the customer goods were rushed to be installed, and the industry competed to buy, and the auction price rose too much. Customer groups watched and did not move forward, and the market on this street faded. The bidding price rose twice before and is now falling. There is no trend that will not fall. According to the industry's vision, it will be difficult to improve in the next period. Of the seven brands of Western satin auctioned, Three Heroes Lion Monkey was 0.04 yuan higher per yard, and the rest were 0.01-0.02 yuan lower. Yuan velvet Five Flower Cave rose 0.03 yuan, and Jiufang West Chess fell 0.02-0.03 yuan. Tribute flannel was 0.0075 yuan lower, and Yuan silk Andian Bao Cai Bashi fell 3.8 yuan to 4 yuan per piece, Eighteen Sons Luanfeng Five Stars fell 2.7 yuan to 3.3 yuan, Huazhu Zhulin Renqiu fell 2 yuan, and merchants Quanfu Eighteen Scholars Bozi Kuali were about 1 yuan lower. Only the sea cow temper price was flat, and the rest fell 0.4-1 yuan. Yanghong cloth was priced at 5 pounds and was a light-weight item, with only one box. The industry competed to buy, and the price was still good.</p>
<h3>Flourishing Trade in Fine Eyebrow and Pearl Tea</h3>
<p>Yesterday, both the foreign firms and the local firms trading in Ping-Shui green tea saw continued brisk business. The Jardine Matheson, Concord, and Jardine Skinner &amp; Co. foreign firms had not yet met their order quotas from overseas, so they continued to purchase over a thousand more chests. Among the local firms, the most traded were the mid-grade Fine Eyebrow and top-grade Pearl Tea, while the most popular Ping-Shui tea was the Mei Cha Qu Wei. Prices remained generally consistent with the past few days, but the trading houses are still suffering losses and remain pessimistic.</p>
<p>Correction: To the Esteemed Editor, Regarding the tea market report in the commercial news of your esteemed newspaper on October 20th, there was an error. The number of Fine Eyebrow tea chests sold by our humble establishment to Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. was 76, not 86. Additionally, the price of Mr. Hu Fusheng's 94 pieces of Fine Eyebrow tea was 30 yuan, not 24 yuan. Furthermore, the price of 58 pieces of Fine Eyebrow tea sold to Jardine Skinner &amp; Co. was 23.5 yuan, not 31 yuan. Because the tea merchants are all located in the distant Anhui and Jiangxi provinces, the prices and quantities of tea sold must be accurate, or it will affect the reputation of our humble establishment. In addition to requesting that you kindly correct this error, we also ask that you pay special attention to accuracy in the future. Sincerely, Shanghai Shengchang Sheng Tea Firm.</p>

<h3>Finance Commodity Speculation: Supply and Demand Discrepancies</h3>
<p>The gold market continued to weaken yesterday due to sluggish demand for downstream pure gold, falling another six dimes.

<h3>Foreign Exchange: Mostly Exchange Transactions Yesterday—London and New York Remained Flat</h3>

In the early morning, overseas telegrams showed that London's spot and forward rates both rose by 0.1875. The New York silver market remained unchanged. The forward silver price in Monterey rose between five and one-tenth of a cent. The London spot gold price fell one penny.

After the opening, banks engaged in mutual transactions. The HSBC announced its rates, with both London and New York remaining flat. Subsequently, the silver balance tax announcement showed a one-cent increase. Japanese banks conducted Japanese-US dollar exchange transactions with the Dalian syndicate, while foreign banks conducted British-US dollar exchange transactions. As a result, the market remained calm. Chinese merchants sold US dollars, and banks bought them. The noon closing price remained calm. In the afternoon, banks still had a strong appetite for transactions. Traders from Hong Kong sold British pound positions. The overall trend fluctuated. The Indian silver rate finally squeezed past the long position by four annas, and there were no changes in the end. The closing selling price for the British pound was 1 shilling, 2 and 46875/100000 pence and a half penny against the US dollar, and the US dollar at $29.50 and $0.5625 against the British pound. Compared to the previous close, both London and New York remained flat. Chinese merchants slightly increased their holdings of US dollars. The following is a record of the transactions:</p>

<h3>Securities: October Government Bond Delivery Completed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the 29th, was the delivery date for October futures at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange. The total amount delivered was $17,715,000. Of this amount, $12,955,000 was settled directly by the brokers through account transfers, and only $4,780,000 was delivered through the exchange. The majority of the deliveries were made by retail investors. Although the market situation experienced multiple shocks and constant changes in the environment, the market price fluctuations were limited. The difference between the highest and lowest prices for Class B and Class C bonds was less than $5, and the difference for Class A bonds was only $3.60. Considering the facts, there were unfortunate events in Chengdu, Beihai, Hankou, and Shanghai. Before September 6th, the Guangxi incident was still very tense. The bond market was stimulated by these events, and prices fell sharply but also rose quickly. Because the Guangxi incident was resolved on September 7th, and the Sino-Japanese incident went through several rounds of negotiations, with the situation fluctuating between tension and relaxation, the bond market trended towards fluctuation. Therefore, on October 26th, the last day, compared to August 26th, the first day, the market prices for Class A and Class D bonds were equal, and the market prices for Class B and Class C bonds were slightly lower by approximately $2. Class E bonds were slightly lower by approximately $1.25. The difference in market prices was $1-2, reflecting the different choices made by investors. The coming of Fan Hua is still being planned and is likely to come later. The following table lists the delivery account transfers and total transaction volume for October futures (unit: $100):</p>
<p>October Delivery Table</p>
<p>Bond Type | Delivery | Account Transfer | Transaction Volume</p>
<p>---|---|---|---</p>
<p>Unified A | 5850 | 14750 | 254650</p>

<h3>Grains: High Grain Prices in the North; Flour Speculators Active; Prices Up by 3-4 Cents in Each Month</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market opened in the morning and prices for each month showed signs of a sharp increase. Although the quoted price for foreign wheat fell by one dime, speculators were not swayed. Even though there were rumors about foreign wheat, they were difficult to confirm. Therefore, after the opening price, buyers were very active again. Prices for each month were two cents better than the previous day. After the second round of trading, transactions were very active. Due to the expulsion of many speculators, the market showed some weakness. By the afternoon opening, the market was initially calm, but then, due to the fact that grain prices in the north had not eased and were even higher than those in Shanghai in some places, speculators took advantage of the situation and absorbed supplies aggressively. Prices for each month rose by another two or three cents. Observing the subsequent trend, if foreign wheat consistently failed to approach, speculators inside and outside the industry would inevitably be eager to move, it was said.</p>
<h3>Spot Prices Remain Firm and High; 期麦 Remains Difficult to Ease</h3>
<p>Yesterday's 期麦 market saw prices for each month gradually rise in the morning opening. Although the quoted price for foreign wheat showed a slight decline, the spot wheat situation remained strong due to tight supplies in the production areas, and transporters were naturally unwilling to let go. Therefore, at the time of the opening price, market sentiment gathered and was two or three cents better than the previous day. By the afternoon opening, because the flour market rose again and spot wheat prices were raised by five cents, the opening price was three or four cents higher than the morning. Transactions in each round were not very active. In the spot wheat market, the price of special-grade wheat was raised by five cents, while medium-grade wheat remained unchanged. Shandong wheat opened at $6.10, medium-grade at $6.07. Mingguang wheat at $6.07, Yanghe wheat at $6.05, Nanjing wheat at $5.83, medium-grade at $5.80, Guangshui wheat at $5.78, medium-grade at $5.70, Jiangbei wheat at $5.90, Chongming wheat at $5.80, medium-grade at $5.75, Hankou car wheat at $5.94, medium-grade at $5.92, Tiantai wheat at $5.91, Gaoyou wheat at $5.88, Dongtai wheat at $5.90. Fook Hsin processed 20,000 bags, Fu Feng processed 8,000 bags, and Shen Da processed 4,000 bags, it was said.</p>
<h3>Tu Chien Store Sales Rebound Strongly</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the total supply from various syndicates was 44-45 ships, with a total of over 9,000 shih, mostly new thin rice. In addition, the storage in Pudong was also large. Therefore, although there were 4,000-5,000 bags of tea seeds handled by the Pingjin Qingyan syndicates and 400-500 bags of thick new japonica rice, the market situation for new thin rice was still normal because the sales market in this street was still suppressed. The prices of new thin rice and thick new japonica rice were stable. As for Tu Yang Chien, due to the renewed activity in the urban and rural markets, the price was raised by one dime, and Yang Chien rose by one and a half dimes. The price of thick and thin broken japonica rice, which had already fallen, still had no fixed standard. The sales of new Yin Yuan were stagnant, and the price was cut by one to one and a half dimes.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about 30 ships arrived from downstream, and the sales of top-grade broken japonica rice and special new japonica rice were sluggish, and the price remained stable. Although the sales market for medium-grade broken japonica rice and new japonica rice was not brisk, the subsequent market was tight by a few cents. Yangbu's customer price for tip rice increased by one dime, and Tu Chien followed up by five or six cents. The appetite for tea seed rice in this city was flat, the sales of buns were uninterrupted, and the price was peaceful. The price of new and old Yin Yuan rice was short by one dime, the price of Yin Yuan rice fell by more than one dime, and the identity was still soft and there was no way to sell it.</p>
<h3>Cantonese Merchants Again Actively Purchase Coarse Indica Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, although the arrival of 客秈 was strong, the sales were even more active. Both machine-milled coarse and high-grade rice rose consistently. Coarse rice was actively purchased by Cantonese merchants, with transactions reaching over 10,000 bags. Machine-milled rice was actively purchased by 夸幫, Beiyang, Henan, and Shantou, and it was rumored that prices in the production areas were strong and there would be a ban on transportation. Jiangxi merchants were selling in the market, and it was also rumored that there was a shortage of rice and high prices upstream, and that they were planning to purchase in Shanghai. Therefore, sentiment improved even further, and the price of high-grade rice rose sharply by one to two dimes, and the customer demand for medium-grade rice was even more active, so it rose sharply by three dimes. The 통市 opened with 18,000-19,000 various rice from Xiang, Gan, and E, it was said.</p>
<h3>Soybean Prices Again Affected by Declining Prices of Dalian Soybeans</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean trade was not deserted. Tong Market opened with over 7,600 bags of green and yellow soybeans from various sources, which were sold to factories in Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and this street. However, the market continued to be hit by the devaluation of Dalian soybeans. Yesterday, the oil mills continued to order five cars of Siping Street soybeans for delivery in November at a price of $5.30, which was another dime lower than the forward market. Other soybeans were affected and fell by five cents to one dime. Sesame and foreign wheat remained unchanged, and the overall situation was not optimistic. There were few transactions of spot raw sesame. Yesterday, only over 370 bags of Haozhou sesame were opened at a price of $9.97 and $9.80, it was said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugarcane Crop Failure; New Sugar Costs Inevitably Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trended flat. The guild's trading panel made no significant changes. For example, #24 coarse granulated white spot was $21.60, with higher grades at $21.70. Transshipment goods were $6.20, and #10 Dutch red, which could arrive on the first of next month, was $6.10. Eastern White #4 (J) mark was $6.45. The #9 spot TM mark was $21.30. The prices for other grades remained unchanged. The Jinxin, Dahua, and Zhenji #1 refined white sugar from local factories were all priced at the original levels. Domestic sugar prices were softening due to weak sales and concerns about the upcoming new crop, so market prices might continue to ease. However, the situation in the production areas was very different from that in Shanghai. It was heard that the sugarcane-producing areas were experiencing insufficient rainfall, leading to poor development and inevitable crop failures. As a result, sugarcane prices were expected to be $4 higher than in previous years, and it was predicted that new sugar prices would be higher than current market prices, making it difficult for prices to fall below current levels. According to reports, the latest production prices, such as Qing劃申, must be raised by $3.90, Upper Huanggang Qing by $13.70, and lower grades were in short supply. For example, Longjiang Qing and Jiazi Qing also required $12.60, Upper Zhiyang $18.50, and other grades varied. Qibai and Fenbai were both out of stock.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Quanzhou Dried Longan Opens at 5,000 Pieces</h3>
<p>Recently, dried longan sales have been brisk, and the market has tightened. Prices in Quanzhou, Xinghua, Tong'an, Zhangzhou, Anhai, and other producing areas have all rebounded. The 5,000 boxes of Quanzhou bubble circle recently arrived from the local businesses have all been cleared yesterday, except for a portion of the consignment goods. The upper grades rose by three or four yuan, and the middle and lower grades also rose by two or three to four yuan. However, the smallest grains did not rise much due to competition from Guangdong goods. According to news from the production areas, prices were higher than those in Shanghai. If sales do not decline in the future, prices may rise again.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Market Remains Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's overseas silk market saw mixed trends. The New York and Yokohama stock market prices seemed to have risen enough and then retreated. The near-term price in New York fell by 0.015, and the long-term price fell by 0.04. The spot price in Yokohama fell by 15 yuan, and the futures price fell by 10 yuan. However, overseas silk merchants maintained firm prices. For example, yesterday the discussion on the price of 83 and 75 evenness silk from New York, Shanghai silk, and Guangdong silk was generally raised by about 0.02. The price of Japanese silk in Lyon rose by one franc, and the prices of other Chinese silks remained unchanged. From this perspective, overseas market sentiment remains stable. However, compared with the Shanghai market, it is difficult to match. Shanghai has risen rapidly and far beyond overseas markets in recent days. Therefore, yesterday's silk market was inevitably firm, and transactions were very few, it was said.</p>
<h3>We Should Emulate Mr. Lu Xun</h3>
<p>— Ai Wu</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun has passed away. In the fourth item of his will, he wrote, "Forget me, and take care of your own lives." Although this was written specifically to his family, it is also suitable for us. Of course, we will not forget him, but in addition to mourning and commemorating him, we should also learn from him so that we can live our lives well in the future.</p>
<p>I believe that the first thing we should emulate is not his short stories or his essays, but his love for humanity, especially his love for the oppressed and the harmed.</p>
<p>He initially went to Japan to study medicine. He said that his purpose was to "cure the suffering of patients like my father who were." Later, when he engaged in literature, he did not regard literature as the only thing, loving it like a treasure, but only "wanted to use its power to improve society." Therefore, the material for his novels was "mostly taken from the unfortunate people in a morbid society, with the intention of exposing their suffering and drawing attention to treatment." When translating, he also paid special attention to "the works of authors from oppressed nations" because the works of oppressed nations mostly conveyed resistance and calls for help.</p>
<p>I remember Tolstoy saying something like this: "The most valuable thing in the world, the foundation for all missions, is not love for art, but love for humanity. Only those who serve in this way have hope of success." I think this is absolutely right, and Mr. Lu Xun's success is an excellent illustration of this.</p>
<p>The second thing we should emulate is his spirit of struggle.</p>
<p>When Mr. Lu Xun became famous in literature, he appeared in society with the prestige of a warrior. Throughout his life, he resisted feudal society, resisted imperialism, and resisted the forces of darkness, and he never weakened even in his old age. He could have written one or two dozen short stories and one or two dozen novels, but he refused. He would rather write many miscellaneous essays. This was not because he lacked material or energy, but because he saw that "at this time, only struggle and combat are needed." Because he knew that miscellaneous essays could be used as seven shots, as throwing spears, "things that can kill a bloody path together with the reader," unlike novels that "expose the suffering and draw attention to treatment," which is a somewhat detached attitude. Now, looking at his essay works, they are just like his criticism of "Luo Yin's 壙書," "almost all talk of resistance and indignation." From this point, we can see even more that his loyalty to life is far greater than his loyalty to art.</p>

<h3>Meeting in Death</h3>
<p>— Tzu Kang</p>
<p>Who would believe that Mr. Lu Xun is dead!</p>
<p>The sky is so cold, people feel like they've been whipped with ice, and ice chains have rolled across their backs. It's not pain, it's coldness. It freezes on one thought: Is this a dream? The cold freezes the thoughts.</p>
<p>And how many young people have suffered this cold whipping!—For a warm stranger in their hearts, a fifty-six-year-old man. Yes, an old man has forged deep friendships with a group of young people. Thousands of small streams are converging on a focus, and old age has not drawn a ditch in the middle of the road.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's not tears that are used to mourn this farewell, but a moment of breath held in the cold whipping, reason and memory grabbed back: This is real!</p>
<p>Isn't it true that in the center of the mourning hall lies at rest that young man who never grew old until his death—his heart was so young, strong, and upward-moving. The work of leading the way is interrupted, he puts down his hand lamp, and quietly slips away from the young people, leaving behind a piece of darkness and thorns. It's so sudden, how much pity is he swallowing.</p>
<p>In the corner, how many familiar and unfamiliar faces from his lifetime cannot restrain their emotions, and are secretly covering their faces, afraid of the silence of death? But they cannot help but raise their red eyes and look again at the face drooping in the flowers.</p>
<p>How many young people, girls, and children sigh:</p>
<p>"He's still so young, no silver beard!"</p>
<p>"He didn't speak, he didn't even say hello, this is the first and last meeting!"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>How many children bowed deeply to this "old grandfather," perhaps they have read the fairy tales translated for them by the "old grandfather," the stories written for them. Under the leadership of the teacher, they pay their final respects, and they will sincerely thank him in their little hearts. Perhaps they are half a century apart, and youth makes them understand this "old grandfather" a little less, but they will have a closer connection to the books he translated.</p>
<p>People who didn't want to leave immediately stayed in the outer room of the mourning hall. There was anxiety, hesitation, and a lingering attachment that was hard to dispel like light smoke. I wanted to hear his voice, even if it was a greeting or a reprimand; I wanted to see his smile—a minute of smile was good too.</p>
<p>But he was deathly quiet, his chest didn't move, not even a cough.</p>
<p>Wreaths and flower baskets were constantly increasing, carefully held in the hands of young people, placed at his head and beside him, so quietly as if afraid to wake him, whispering blessings: Rest well! How many hands offering wreaths were trembling.</p>
<p>How many people hated "death" on this day, because it can snatch away some of the lives that people cherish. "Death" is so cruel and unforgiving, taking away this wave that is occasionally seen in the sea of people—beautiful, powerful, with the majesty of a giant. I can't find this wave again, it sinks into the vast sea, not annihilation, but differentiation, dissolving into new thousands of waves.</p>
<p>Larger waves are growing, using new power to impact, all so strong, so stubborn.</p>
<p>Passionate girls wanted to cry out, turning their heads towards the wall, and suddenly remembered the two big characters "Silence" at the door, turning their rampant passion into solemn grief—Silence, silence will sublimate into power on the leaves.</p>
<p>Lying in front of us is a long road, and the "living" must breathe, walk, and work in the road; the "living" will bravely face the oncoming storms with firm faces and kick away the darkness.</p>
<p>Everyone believes that the "ageless comrade" is continuing to breathe, this pause is rest, he secretly sends off the ranks of the "living," he listens attentively to the struggle between the "living" and the darkness, and smiles and waves to future generations.</p>
<p>"He's just stretching his tired muscles and bones, he's asking for a long vacation, won't you let him rest?" A voice was saying in people's ears.</p>
<p>"Where are his children!" Someone found the seven-year-old boy in a corner, with his father's shadow on his face. The innocent child jumped around his mother and relatives, and did not forget his books and his picture albums. He should be grateful for the education he had received in those seven years.</p>
<p>"Mom! Dad..." The child thought of something and wanted to find his father, his little eyes turned, and he suddenly changed: "Where's Uncle? Where's Mr. Huang?" He knew his dad wouldn't speak again, as if he had sensed the tension in the air, and lowered his little throat as well.</p>
<p>"Death" will not draw a clear outline in a child's heart. There is only strangeness and surprise for this strange thing.</p>
<p>Who would believe that "he" is dead! But everyone was whipped by the cold.</p>
<p>In front is a long road, let's raise the torch that was put down with millions of hands. October 21st.</p>
<h3>Crying for Mr. Lu Xun</h3>
<p>— Ye Zi</p>
<p>I suffer from tuberculosis and pleurisy,</p>
<p>He wrote to me, sent me a dollar, and said to me:</p>
<p>"Young man, don't worry, rest and recuperate,</p>
<p>The illness will naturally get better."</p>
<p>But suddenly, a friend came to tell me his bad news.</p>
<p>So, I cried.</p>
<p>The doctor ran to me and said:</p>
<p>"Your fever is too high, you can't cry."</p>
<p>But how can I not cry!</p>
<p>The nurse ran to me and said:</p>
<p>"Your illness is very dangerous,</p>
<p>We don't allow you to be sad, we don't allow you to cry."</p>
<p>But how can I not cry!</p>
<p>We have not only lost a great teacher, a great comrade-in-arms,</p>
<p>But also lost the great spirit of the nation.</p>
<p>How can I not cry!</p>
<p>I cried all day, I cried all night,</p>
<p>The fever got higher, the breathing got faster,</p>
<p>Two nurses ran over to interfere with me severely!</p>
<p>"We don't allow you to cry!"</p>
<p>Using an ice pack to ice my head,</p>
<p>Using an ice pack to ice my chest.</p>
<p>They want to reduce my fever,</p>
<p>Want to cool my heart,</p>
<p>But how can I not cry! (October 20th, in the hospital)</p>
<h3>Words in a Young Person's Heart</h3>
<p>— Huang Yuan</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun is dead. Mr. Lu Xun has been dead for ten days. This is an undeniable fact. But can we believe it? No, absolutely not! I believe millions of young people will answer in unison: "No, absolutely not!"</p>
<p>Upon receiving the news of his death, I rushed to his bedside. It was two hours after he had stopped breathing. At that time, his hands were still warm. I gazed at him greedily. I seemed to see his chest still rising and falling. I knew it was an illusion. I kept this secret to myself. In the afternoon, the body was sent to the funeral parlor. The funeral parlor could not be occupied at night. When it was late, everyone had left, leaving only five of us young people to keep watch. At this time, the night was quiet and still. An upward-facing electric light in the room emitted a soft glow. Mr. Lu Xun slept peacefully and quietly on the bed surrounded by wreaths. Someone repeatedly said, "He is not dead. He is asleep. He seems like he will wake up and talk to us." When he was ill, he often lay down and talked to us. We all felt the same way.</p>
<p>In recent years, due to various reasons, although Mr. Lu Xun loved young people, he could not interact with them often. We were among the luckiest few of millions of young people, able to be close to Mr. Lu Xun and listen to his teachings. But this was our last opportunity to be close to him. I stood by the bed, touched his hand. His hand was cold. I wanted to look at him a few more times, to gaze at him greedily. I still seemed to see his chest rising and falling. I knew this was an illusion. I did not dare tell anyone. I kept this secret to myself.</p>
<p>The next day, the body was moved to the hall. From morning to night, it was crowded with young people paying their respects. They arrived with infinite grief. As soon as they stepped into the solemn hall, even seeing Mr. Lu Xun's body and portrait from afar, they could not hold back their tears. They may or may not have known Mr. Lu Xun, but their hearts of respect and grief were the same. It was not just respect and grief; after paying their respects, seeing Mr. Lu Xun, who had struggled bitterly all his life, lying quietly, knowing that the spirit of his bitter struggle now needed to be inherited by everyone, they felt anger and stepped out of the hall with resolute steps. I know that the spirit of Mr. Lu Xun lives in the heart of every young person and will blossom into magnificent and glorious flowers.</p>
<p>In the evening, more than six thousand young people came in with grief and left with resolute steps. The funeral hall became empty again. No, the funeral hall would not be empty and lonely. In just this one day, it had retained the deep grief and resolute heroism of more than six thousand young people.</p>
<p>The area in front of the coffin was piled with wreaths and flowers. Mr. Lu Xun slept peacefully in the flowers. The four of us young people accompanied Mr. Lu Xun and slept in the fragrance of the flowers. Before going to sleep, I quietly stood in front of Mr. Lu Xun's coffin, gazing at him greedily. I wanted to look at him a few more times. I saw his chest rising and falling again. I put my hand on my own chest, silently saying, "Mr. Lu Xun, your words are in my heart, and also in the hearts of millions of young people." But I still kept this secret to myself.</p>
<p>The next evening, Mr. Lu Xun's body was placed in a coffin with a glass lid, so that the upper part of his body was still visible. I silently stood in front of the coffin, gazing at him greedily. I wanted to look at him a few more times. I still saw his chest rising and falling. I could no longer keep this secret to myself. I called Yu and over and said to them:</p>
<p>"Look, Mr. Zhou seems to still be breathing."</p>
<p>They both said, "I also see that he seems to be breathing."</p>
<p>Could everyone be making the same mistake?</p>
<p>"No," I can say. Although Mr. Lu Xun's body is dead, his heart, his spirit, lives on, lives in the heart of each of us, lives in the hearts of millions of young people!</p>
<h3>He Will Shout Forever</h3>
<p>— Yi Fan</p>
<p>The impression Mr. Lu Xun's death gives us is not of death, but of fresh vitality. When his body was alive in the world, he did not let those he influenced come into contact with his colors and sounds every day. But after his death, his influence not only remains active in the hearts of every living person, but also lives more vividly and more truly. What died was only the body that a few of his friends could approach, but his unwavering spirit of resistance to inertia shines brightly among us and deeply penetrates all parts of the world.</p>
<p>In the midst of darkness and turmoil, we need light, we need friends. Mr. Lu Xun is the light that guides our modern youth, a friend to the masses. He shows us the direction, gives us courage, and teaches us to resist to the end. Young people all over the world need Mr. Lu Xun, and the young people of China especially need him. China does not lack writers, but it lacks tough, uncompromising, and unyielding writers like Mr. Lu Xun. Looking at the literary world in China, apart from those who specialize in talking about romance and using pornography to numb young people, there are some refined and humorous scholars who, after running several self-proclaimed pure and high-minded magazines in China, sell some of the so-called elegance of the Chinese people, the shortcomings of the Chinese people in the past, to foreign countries, flattering foreigners and making foreign money. There are also those who once stood among the masses and declared war on evil forces, but later, out of cowardice and selfishness, went to a friendly country to live as a pensioner. There are also those who, after encountering setbacks in their struggle, abandoned their careers and friends and went to live a secluded life. These are all considered writers, all considered living people, but some have been forgotten by us, and some have been discarded by us, and have died in our hearts. We need Mr. Lu Xun. Although we cannot keep him from the death of his body, his thoughts, his words and deeds, and the influence arising therefrom, will be more respected and more truly immortal among us than when he was alive.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun once said: "My enemies are numerous. Let them hate. I will not forgive a single one." These words were not only spoken to his enemies, but also to his friends. Mr. Lu Xun is dead. His satirical and intolerant pen has been laid down. His sharp mouth has also been closed. But his friends all over the world will rise up after him, using their pens, their mouths, their fists, their teeth, their lives, to fight hand-to-hand with the unforgivable enemy. In this process, you and I can believe that it is Mr. Lu Xun himself. We will hear his shouts in all parts of the world and feel his unmistakable presence.</p>
<p>October 21.</p>
<h3>Heartache</h3>
<p>— Leng Mo</p>
<p>Heavy sorrow can lead to sudden, severe heartache. But a healthy person will hardly ever fall into such a situation easily. We often hear people say "why heartache," and some are just embellishments. Of course, this is just speculation. Assuming that one person should have the same feelings as another is not permissible, and assuming that two people are equally healthy is not easy to confirm accurately. As for myself, I feel that even presuming upon this point may not be right, but I believe that such presumption is by no means malicious. It is just a kind of admiration for healthy people. Because of circulatory problems that have plagued me for several years, my heartache is often easily triggered. Seeing models of diseases in the hospital will cause heartache, hearing the sirens of ambulances will cause heartache. Such worthless heartache, even when caused by sorrow, naturally does not indicate the depth of the sorrow. Only healthy people have the right to use heartache to express sorrow.</p>
<p>The sorrow of the weak is of course worthless, but it will continue shamelessly. Recently, my mind has been imprinted with phrases like "shortness of breath, unable to sleep, cardiac paralysis, sudden death." These phrases were obtained from the news of the death of a literary giant. For him, I will not say any commemorative words. My own worthless sorrow is naturally nothing to say. He certainly has many legacies that must be remembered, but some of his symptoms at the time of his death do not need to be remembered by others. Those words that are firmly imprinted in my mind have no meaning except for myself. Even the meaning for myself cannot be grasped in a concrete way. Is it because "Having grieved for the departed, I will reflect on myself"? I am not so decadent yet. Because I am not decadent, do I feel that the spirit of struggling heroically to the end still gives me a sense of encouragement? Then, the depressed mood caused by the disease no longer needs to be disguised. I know that I do not have the ability to turn a moan into another cry. Honestly, I even see a hint of pain in the healthy writing of others. Naturally, many of the great writer's works are written with extreme pain. But I strangely think that perhaps that luxury of pain is inherent in the disease. Could this be the meaning of my remembering the symptoms of the deceased?</p>
<p>Reading Chekhov's late works often brings to mind his appearance, tormented by illness. Reading other people's accounts of Chekhov's later life, he still tried his best to show calm and joy in his daily life, but in his own works, he could not help but naturally reveal his painful mood. This may not necessarily be unintentional, because he originally did not conceal his melancholic nature. Gorky, who suffered from the same disease as him, was completely without pessimism, but it cannot be said that his works do not contain elements formed by the disease. There are many places in his works that we cannot help but read with hurried breath, and I am afraid that the author wrote them in hurried breath. We do not need to pry into the disguise of suffering. Prying into it may be an insult to the work, but due to the psychology of the disease, we cannot help but regard it this way, and there is no way to avoid it. It is okay to say that this is an unhealthy idea. It is okay to say that this is an absurd idea. There is no need to reject this blame. Unless the deceased can add a little compassion to this mood, even in his lifetime, it would not be allowed.</p>
<p>Not long ago, a certain writer had an article expounding the psychology of the sick protagonist in one of his novels. This may have nothing to do with the writer himself, but the same type of protagonist appears repeatedly in the writer's various works, and it can be considered to reflect himself, or to reflect a certain real person. That protagonist has the characteristics of拼命工 (拼命工 - 'desperate worker', hard work), easy anger, and contempt for stupidity, etc., so his death becomes a conscious and inevitable death. The reader does not completely sympathize with this type of character, and it can be said that some people simply do not sympathize with him at all. However, if the author's opinion is allowed to be presumed, then this type of character is exactly the kind of character that the author uses to persuade people to sympathize with them. The reader's emotions do not correspond, because the factor of disease is ignored, so the author wants to specifically bring it up. However, after the author specifically brings it up, the healthy reader is afraid that he still cannot make any changes. The disease factor is too much regarded as mental, changeable, and people forget that it is material, irresistible. As for readers with similar diseases, even if the author does not mention the disease, they will feel it themselves, and they will also worry that the author is writing with the same sick mood. In this way, not only will they themselves have heartache, but they will also have heartache for the author and heartache for this type of character. This heartache can be said to be worthless, but I am afraid that there is always a reason that I cannot explain.</p>
<p>I do not know exactly to what extent lung disease can lead to heart abnormalities, and whether some patients only develop heart abnormalities at the end. Using the psychology of heart patients to pry into the psychology of lung patients is probably not suitable. But as long as the suffering is not completely different, then the presumption may not be entirely a misunderstanding. And that unnecessary memory has its own reasons for becoming a memory.</p>
<h3>Silent Greatness</h3>
<p>— Yi Bei</p>
<p>"I am like an ox, eating grass and squeezing out milk and blood." (Note 1)</p>
<p>Now, I feel even more the greatness of the ox. In the dim, cold dawn, treading on the frosty, cold earth, dragging the heavy iron plow, panting and breathing, quietly turning over the stubborn, barren soil, helping the seeds to grow, is the ox; and coming into the world to gnaw on dry, withered grass stalks, taking out priceless strength and nourishing milk and blood, all the way to death, is also the ox. But what makes us feel even more tragic is that even when panting and breathing, it still sincerely and silently squeezes out strength, milk, and blood. In this world of ours where we only hear people shouting "giving my all until my heart stops beating" and deceiving people, we can hardly imagine the sublimity of the ox.</p>
<p>But in this human world, "on the one hand, there is solemn work, and on the other hand, there is debauchery and shamelessness" (Note 2) – what else can be said? The regrettable thing is that even the wanton yapping of those tens of thousands of dogs cannot cover up the sublimity and greatness of the ox. It still makes us convinced that "no matter where, in the trivial self-enjoyment, there are people who want to comfort humanity; no matter in any era or in any country, there are rebels who raise their voices of resistance against the ugly and hateful reality. ... These rebels always end up pointing people to the road they should take, pushing people onto that road... It is breaking the work of those preachers who either make people compromise with the ugliness of the reality created by the old society or make people sink into ease and pleasure." (Note 3)</p>
<p>In our era, in our country, we have Mr. Lu Xun. He silently struggled with the baseness of humanity all his life - yes, it should be said that this "silent" greatness will forever shine brightly among us. He did not sigh once for being tired, "he did not know rest," and when he died, only from the mouth of his closest person did this wisp of tragic sound come out. Thinking of this, we cannot help but shed tears of tragic gratitude. Yes, Mr. Lu Xun should be said to be a great ox. His hardship is like that of an ox: he has also constantly dragged a heavy iron plow, treading the frozen long road in the dim, cold dawn, plowing the barren soil, and helping the lovely seeds on the ground to grow. "He eats grass and squeezes out milk and blood." But he is also different from the ox: his milk and blood never nourished the fat on the executioner's body - on the contrary, they poisoned them. His priceless and bitter milk and blood nourished the new generation of the future.</p>
<p>Now, this "great ox of great humanity" has left us forever. What remains in our hearts is a heavy and indelible dark shadow. Thinking of that great and tragic voice, I cannot help but cry bitterly. But we cannot forget those other base and joyful snickers hidden in the corners. Under the proclamation of the great "ox," can we use tears to answer the mocking snickers of the old world?</p>
<p>No - but let them say no more. Under the dim, cold dawn, the human world still retains thousands of miles of ridges and mountains. At this time, Mr. Lu Xun's death, for him and for us, is only full of unspeakable sorrow and regret.</p>
<p>However, we allow ourselves: we will always remember that great "ox" -</p>
<p>"He eats grass and squeezes out milk and blood."</p>

<h3>Mr. Lu Xun's Achievements in Language Reform</h3>
<p>— Chu Yang</p>
<p>When enumerating Mr. Lu Xun's achievements in literature and the cultural movement, from the perspective of fundamental issues, his great contribution to language reform should be mentioned first. He was one of the first warriors of the "New Youth" to advocate vernacular Chinese. Looking at it today, he was the only person who fought tenaciously, persevered to the end, and strived for progress. Who among his contemporaries was not stagnant in the era and compromised with the old forces? Only Mr. Lu Xun, from advocating vernacular Chinese, attacking zombie literature, opposing scripture recitation and restoration, sweeping away "recorded sayings," to his most recent literary propositions, stood on the front line as a tenacious fighter. His influence is not only related to the changes and development of the entire nation's culture, but also paves the way for thousands of years to come.</p>
<p>Secondly: Mr. Lu Xun was also one of the earliest masters in establishing a new literary style. The emergence of the new-style novel in China began with his realistic work "Diary of a Madman" (published in 1918). His essays, which are called "a shot like a spear" or "miscellaneous essays," are unmatched in terms of quantity or quality. As for argumentative essays, Mr. Lu Xun once again created a unique style full of unique style and charm, sharp, cynical, scolding and cursing, filled with serious reason and surging passion.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Lu Xun's efforts in introducing foreign literary works from the earliest to the latest have resulted in the adoption of Western grammar, the habitual use of foreign loanwords, and the imitation of vocabulary... All efforts to increase the function of Chinese language and make up for its unscientific defects have been made to the best of his ability. If we carefully study his translations or works, we can discover many traces, some of which are even invisible, having been integrated into the literary web that he carefully created. It is these subtle creations that have great value and merit for the evolution of language and the learning of literary apprentices in the future.</p>
<p>If we only look at Mr. Lu Xun's work in language alone, we can feel that he has spent a lot of effort.</p>
<p>But the admirable and lovable thing about Mr. Lu Xun is that he saw his own and other people's strengths very clearly. He was never spiritually satisfied with what he pursued. "The world has no end, progress has no limit!" (Liang Rengong's words). Mr. Lu Xun was an extremely thorough evolutionist, a person with a dynamic worldview in essence. Even though he spent thirty years, day and night, pen in hand, he was never satisfied with his own articles written in words honed day and night, and constantly sought progress. It was in this state of dissatisfaction and desire for progress that he did his best, walked the path he should take, and also illuminated our path. We have received instructions from him. Let's see what he said:</p>
<p>"…I won't talk about others, but as for myself, it is true that I have read many old books. It is true that I am still reading them for teaching, so I am inevitably influenced by them and the sentences and structures of old Chinese are often revealed in my vernacular Chinese writing. But I am suffering from carrying these ancient ghosts on my back and cannot get rid of them, and I often feel a depressing heaviness... Mostly because of laziness, I often comfort myself that everything is in transition and there are always intermediate things. Between monocotyledons and dicotyledons, between invertebrates and vertebrates, there are intermediate things; or it can simply be said that in the chain of evolution, everything is an intermediate thing. When we first reformed writing, it was natural to have some authors who were neither fish nor fowl. It could only be like this, and it needed to be like this. Their task is to shout out a new voice after being somewhat alert; and because they come from the old camp, they see the situation more clearly and when they strike back, they should strike at the enemy's vitals. But they should still pass with time and gradually disappear, and at most they are just a piece of wood or stone in a bridge, not a target or model for the future. Those who follow should be different. If they are not naturally gifted, they cannot suddenly get rid of their accumulated habits, but they must have a newer look. In terms of literature, they do not need to make a living in old books, but should take the tongues of living people as a source, making articles closer to language and more vibrant. As for how to remedy the poverty and lack of the language of the people today and enrich it, that is also a big problem..."</p>
<p>Below he says: "I think that if I work hard enough, I can probably still collect spoken language to reform my writing, but because I am lazy and busy, I have not done it yet… (Lu Xun Selected Collection, page 64: Written Behind the Tomb)"</p>
<p>Did Mr. Lu Xun really not do it? Even if he didn't, it doesn't matter. He shouted out that he "came from the old camp, saw the situation more clearly, and attacked the enemy's vitals with ease." At least he has pointed out "the target for the future" to us.</p>

<h3>...Famous Gonorrhea Scholar... Group Strengthening of Gonorrhea Treatment Strategies... Confirmation of Anti-Gonorrhea Toxin Policy... Scientific Evolution Has Reached a New Stage</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>The Final and Powerful Defense Against Gonococcus... For Blood and Internal Tissue... Most Appropriate and Fundamental Treatment... Is to Enhance the Function of Blood Cells Throughout the Body</p>
<p>Science has brought human society into a new stage. Everything is organized and disciplined. Like the control of the economy and the dictatorship of politics, the culture of the upper echelons of society is summarized into iron organizations, making them disciplined. This spirit of collectivism is now permeating the world.</p>
<p>If we try to examine the recent situation in the international medical community, we can also see that the medical community fully reveals this organized group spirit. This is especially manifested in the field of gonorrhea treatment. The gradual trend toward consistency in gonorrhea treatment is enough to prove that the power of science can solve the divergent difficulties of gonorrhea treatment.</p>
<p>Now, famous gonorrhea scholars and clinical medical experts are doing their best to accelerate the group strengthening of gonorrhea treatment plans! That is, after multiple discussions and investigations, the publicly recognized special effect protein therapy was designated as a collective application. According to reports from statisticians, since hospitals and doctors have adopted this therapy, gonorrhea in European countries has greatly reduced its momentum! The reason why protein has such an effect is because gonococcal toxin is hidden in the blood and has the effect of destroying blood cells. Therefore, local therapy that penetrates the membrane to kill bacteria can hardly achieve a complete effect. Protein can increase blood cells, enhance the body's anti-gonorrhea factors, and make the phagocytic function of blood cells increase sharply! Therefore, the root is cut off the fastest, but the protein must be combined with yellow pigment to eliminate local urethral inflammation, which is the most effective benefit. So the most reasonable preparation, "Kelinong," is just right. This agent also treats disturbing gonococcal orchitis. After taking it, testicular swelling can be gradually eliminated and normal fertility can be obtained.</p>
<p>As for complications of gonorrhea, such as arthritis, posterior urethritis, prostate enlargement, and seminal vesicle inflammation with blood in the semen, a definite cure can be obtained after taking "Kelinong." Because this agent can not only improve the bacterial phagocytic function of blood cells, but also increase cells in the affected area, so that the tissues of the urethra that have been necrotic due to gonorrhea can be quickly restored. And the properties of the medicine are kingly, so you can rest assured that you are taking it! In addition, in addition to treating all acute and chronic gonorrhea in men, this agent also has supreme efficacy for lymphotoxic symptoms such as vaginal inflammation and leukorrhea in women. However, it is best to take this agent internally on one side, and use "Kaerxuedi" vaginal tablets on the other side, inserting one or two tablets into the vagina every night. With such treatment, I don’t know how much great effect I have received in Russia and after returning to China!</p>
<h3>Injury to the Thymus Gland: Preventing Aging and Reversing Aging Differentiated</h3>
<p>— Translated by Dr. Chen Minbo, Graduate of the Medical Department of Tokyo Imperial University</p>
<p>……Excessive sentimentality in patients with bound feet causes premature aging, ……Disease prevention and hygiene are methods for preserving youth and reversing aging.</p>
<p>Preventing aging and reversing aging seem similar on the surface. In reality, they are worlds apart. Preventing aging is preventing the premature loss of youth, while reversing aging is calling back youth that has already passed. Generally, whether we humans age early or not is entirely governed by the endocrine function. If this endocrine function is healthy and free from disease, then aging will only occur at an appropriate age. If aging has already occurred due to age, it is not easy to reclaim youth. However, if a young person in their early twenties already shows signs of weakness, they must have suffered from venereal disease or led an unhygienic life. As long as the disease is cured, their youth can still be reclaimed. This method of reversing aging is indeed possible because it aims to bring physiological function in line with age! There is nothing mysterious or surprising about it.</p>
<p>Nowadays, many young people outwardly appear shrouded in gloom. In reality, they have prematurely engaged in masturbation before their development was complete, or they have been diligent in marital relations after early marriage, thus prematurely damaging their thymus glands. As a result, the body's development is disrupted, leading to anemia, malnutrition, muscle relaxation, and hair becoming dry, white, or falling out due to malnutrition. The face appears haggard. In particular, damage to the thymus gland leads to incomplete lower body development, nocturnal emissions, premature ejaculation, and inability to achieve penile erection. Sexual life also plunges into an abyss of extreme distress. Other symptoms include headaches, insomnia, heart palpitations, impaired memory, poor judgment, and weak back and legs, all revealing an aged appearance. Therefore, to rescue them and reclaim prematurely lost non-physiological youth, the most effective remedy is taking "Buti Kang" (Body Strong). This medication is made using hormones from young, strong animals and has been proven by world-renowned physicians to have the effect of invigorating the endocrine system, remodeling the reproductive system tissues to achieve health and completeness. All metabolic functions return to vigor. Thus, new blood increases, muscles become fuller, complexion becomes rosy, and original youthful vitality is restored. Symptoms such as sexual neurasthenia, premature ejaculation, nocturnal emissions, and insufficient erectile power are also cured. Sexual love is restored to harmony. Therefore, those who feel sexually unsatisfied, experience decreased pleasure, or suffer from premature aging are invariably cured within five to six weeks of taking "Buti Kang." However, those with nocturnal emissions can take "Nai Er Si Nocturnal Emission Tablets" concurrently for complete recovery. Its results are absolutely outstanding. This is the factual experience I have gained since graduating from Tokyo Imperial University and returning to practice medicine.</p>
<h3>Seminal Vesiculitis Impairing Fertility</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Lin Waishan, following gonorrhea, developed a habit of drinking, the disease suddenly changed, turning into seminal vesiculitis. There was a feeling of fullness in the lower abdomen. Pain in the seminal vesicle area radiated around it, with an unpleasant sensation in the perineum and anus. Furthermore, there was intermittent discharge of pus and blood, and occasional painful nocturnal emissions. When this semen was smeared on a glass slide and examined under a microscope, many gonococci were found, mixed with semen and pus cells, with all sperm cells dead. (As shown in the first image.) If left untreated for a long time, it would inevitably lead to infertility. After treatment with X-rays and electrotherapy, he then took "Kelin Nong" to kill bacteria and reduce inflammation, completely encircling and annihilating the gonococci scattered in various places, resulting in complete recovery. However, to prove whether a radical cure had been achieved, he was asked to come back for examination two weeks after recovery. Blood was drawn and examined under a microscope, revealing no traces of gonococci, with the blood being pure and flawless (as shown in the second image). Therefore, it was proven that Mr. Lin's seminal vesiculitis had been fundamentally cured.</p>

<p>Image 2: This is the examination of blood drawn after recovery from seminal vesiculitis after taking "Kelin Nong," proving the absence of gonococci.</p>
<h3>Talking About Self-Treatment While Sick</h3>
<p>— Dr. Song Zhongyu</p>
<p>Leukorrhea, also known in ancient times as "dai xia" (vaginal discharge), is mostly caused by uncleanliness of the female genitalia and rough sexual intercourse or masturbation. The vagina has a constant flow of dirty fluid, causing erosion and ulcers, inducing menstrual irregularities, leading to stopped menstruation, abdominal distension, stabbing pain, and a tendency for abnormal mental states. Furthermore, it invites the growth of bacteria, leading to uterine bleeding and changes in the function of reproductive organs. Therefore, patients must seek radical treatment early.</p>
<p>Based on my detailed research in clinical practice over the years, I know that the most effective treatment for leukorrhea is the external use of "Ka Er Xu Di Shi Vaginal Tablets." These tablets have the functions of preventing decay, stopping secretions, reducing inflammation, and killing bacteria. Therefore, they are most suitable for treating leukorrhea. After four to five weeks of application, the discharge can be completely cleaned, leaving it as clean and dry as a virgin's. However, those with pre-existing menstrual irregularities can take "Bu Nu Rong" (Nourish Woman's Complex) internally to regulate menstruation and strengthen the body. Those caused by gonorrhea can take "Kelin Nong," while still using "Ka Er Xu Di Shi Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories. The effectiveness can be expected daily.</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea Lecture by Dr. Yao Juyan</h3>
<p>(Clinic): Corner of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road (Consultation Hours): 10 AM to 6 PM</p>
<p>Neglected and Untreated Prostatitis</p>
<p>Gonorrheal prostatitis can be said to be the most commonly encountered symptom of gonorrhea. However, it is also a disease that is easily overlooked by us. Because of these two reasons, it is enough to promote the dangerousness of gonorrhea symptoms. Originally, the prostate gland holds a very important position in the reproductive organs, and its secretions are an essential element for sperm activity. Once lost, it is like a fish out of water, immediately drying up and dying. Therefore, those suffering from prostatitis, if not given thorough and radical treatment, will often result in infertility. Patients constantly feel difficulty in urination, with urine appearing like floating silk, or mixed with blood droplets. There is distending pain in the anus and perineum. Those with a nervous disposition will often feel severe pain during examination or massage of the prostate gland. It often leads to sexual neurasthenia, such as nocturnal emissions, premature ejaculation, and seminal leakage. If still neglected and untreated, the prostate gland will develop leaks from inflammation, resulting in the loss of glandular fluid. As a result, it becomes the main cause of infertility.</p>
<p>To save this disease, it is appropriate to emphasize both the examination of gonorrhea and the strengthening of the reproductive system's tissues. Mr. Yang Yongxiong, residing on Huade Road, had urethritis that turned into prostatitis. Because his job kept him busy, he could not get complete treatment. He usually felt difficulty in urination, and his urine was cloudy, with frequent nocturnal emissions. As a result, his physical strength became increasingly depleted. He had been married to his wife for three years and had never conceived, but instead transmitted the hateful gonococci to his wife, causing their relationship to turn cold. A month ago, after reading my book "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases," he earnestly sought my treatment. In addition to performing alternating long and shortwave electrotherapy, I also instructed him to take "Kelin Nong" to completely annihilate the gonococci at the lesion, to reduce inflammation, promote diuresis, relieve pain, reduce swelling, and prevent decay. On the other hand, he took "Buti Kang" to strengthen his nerves, so that the reproductive system's tissues tended to strengthen. After five weeks of treatment, he was completely cured. Even with frequent drinking and strenuous labor, there were no changes. His wife's leukorrhea was also treated with "Kelin Nong" and "Ka Er Xu Di Shi Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories. After three weeks of continuous treatment, she was also cured safely and without pain. Last year, they happily had a son. This shows that their reproductive ability has been restored.</p>
<h3>Kidney Disease Experiment Record</h3>
<p>— Deng Yuanhe, Former Professor of Nanyang Medical University and Director of Shanghai South People's Hospital</p>
<p>(Clinic) Corner of Ningbo Road and Sichuan Road (Consultation Hours) 4 PM to 6 PM</p>
<p>Incomplete Development…Small Penis</p>
<p>Mr. Li Weilian, 24 years old, student.</p>
<p>Cause of illness: Congenital deficiency, small body. At the age of fourteen or fifteen, he was seduced by bad friends and developed masturbation, leading to nocturnal emissions.</p>
<p>Symptoms: Frequent nocturnal emissions, physical exhaustion. Mental fatigue, pale face. Weak physique, small genitalia, weak erectile power. When interacting with women, he felt a constant leakage of semen.</p>
<p>Diagnosis and treatment: I diagnosed sexual neurasthenia and hormone deficiency, so I instructed him to purchase "Buti Kang" from Wing On Company to promote hormone replenishment, and "Nai Er Si Nocturnal Emission Tablets" to treat his nocturnal emissions, and applied electrical therapy. In less than a month, his complexion became plump, his sexual function became strong, and he achieved good development!</p>
<p>Premature Ejaculation and Kidney Atrophy...Deficiency in Marital Relations</p>
<p>Mr. Dong Suxing, 32 years old. Cause of illness: Unrestrained sexual activity after marriage, loss of sexual function. Weak and unable to erect, ejaculating immediately upon penetration. Wife became estranged. Gradually leading to night sweats, insomnia, and extreme fatigue! Diagnosis and treatment: I prescribed "Buti Kang," and he was completely cured in less than five weeks, becoming vigorous and strong!</p>
<h3>Female Neurasthenia and Family</h3>
<p>— Wu Zhonglin, Graduate of Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>……Is the demon that disrupts family happiness,……It is advisable to resolve it early to avoid lasting harm!</p>
<p>The physiology of women is different from that of men, and their social environment is also very different from that of men. For example, women have menstrual disorders, which men do not. Women with abnormal ovarian function often have irregular menstruation. Those with irregular menstruation often affect neurasthenia. Therefore, experience tells us that women suffering from hysteria are often related to menstrual disorders. This is because the ovaries and nerves have a close relationship. Also, the symptoms of those suffering from these diseases are easy to anger, easy to cry, dizziness, and being in a fog all day long, with constant vaginal discharge, yellow face, and thin muscles, resembling an old woman. A family with such patients is no different from a demon of family happiness. These patients often pollute the atmosphere of happiness, and the husband's career is greatly affected. In addition, it has a great relationship with fertility.</p>
<p>"Bu Nu Rong" (Nourish Woman's Complex) is a very appropriate treatment for women with neurasthenia because "Bu Nu Rong" has the effect of adjusting the ovaries and supplementing the deficiency of follicle-stimulating hormone. Therefore, it can adjust menstruation and increase conception. Neurasthenia related to this disease will also be cured. The atmosphere of family happiness will naturally be filled with joy. Therefore, "Bu Nu Rong" is the destiny of family happiness! After graduating from Nantong Medical University, I have used this method to cure countless women's diseases, and all have been cured in a short period of time. Only those with vaginal discharge can use "Ka Er Xu Di Shi Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories in addition to "Bu Nu Rong."</p>
<h3>Foundation of Marital Love</h3>
<p>— Song Zhongyu, Graduate of the Army Medical University</p>
<p>Maintaining a Fulfilling Sexual Life Is the Protection Charm of Love between Both Sexes</p>
<p>In the course of life, love is an indispensable link. In addition to the greatness of maternal love, only marital love is the most sincere. Therefore, how to further maintain the love between the two sexes is indeed a serious problem. It cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>We can often see in newspapers that couples are at odds, wives are having affairs, and husbands are wandering outside. It is clear that the coldness of emotions between the two sexes is entirely due to the disharmony of sexual life between the two parties. The most obvious example is that noble women in large families cannot satisfy their full pleasure and often elope with coachmen, etc. This shows that no matter how happy the family environment is, if there is no adequate sexual life between the couple, love will eventually break down.</p>
<p>The reason for this sexual dissatisfaction is largely the responsibility of the husband. Because the husband had masturbatory behavior before marriage, or excessive indulgence in sex after marriage, he will inevitably suffer from sexual neurasthenia, impotence, premature ejaculation, nocturnal emissions, etc., or the sexual organ is small, and the other party has no pleasure at all. The most reliable treatment for this kind of sexual obstacle is to take the hormone agent "Buti Kang" internally to invigorate the hormone, nourish the weakened sexual nerves, and then be able to completely cure it in a very short period of time!</p>
<h3>The True Meaning of Quitting Opium</h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>Not Only Does It Damage the Human Body's Sexuality, It Also Destroys Hormones and Impairs Cells</p>
<p>The harm of opium is most able to destroy human hormones. Once this main resource of vitality—hormones—is lost, it will affect the vitality of cells throughout the body, thus reducing metabolism, atrophying cells, and causing symptoms of muscle wasting and yellow complexion.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the nerves lose the nourishment of hormones, also showing weakness, so symptoms such as insomnia, palpitations, decreased appetite, and constipation constantly arrive. Therefore, long-time opium smokers only use opium to refresh their minds, obtaining temporary paralysis.</p>
<p>It is no wonder that opium addicts' nerves tend to weaken due to hormone deficiency, leading to symptoms of impotence and premature ejaculation. How easy is it to quit smoking? Some doctors believe that opium addicts' sex glands are weak, so the method of quitting smoking is to focus on nourishing sexual function. In fact, the most important thing in quitting smoking is to invigorate the body's hormones: with vigorous hormones, muscles, tissues, nerves, etc. throughout the body will be healthy. Therefore, the most reasonable way to quit smoking is to take the hormone agent "Buti Kang" internally. Because of the special combination of this drug, it can clear opium toxins and strengthen physical strength and blood, etc.</p>
<h3>The Evil Consequences and Symptoms of Youthful Masturbation</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan</p>
<p>……Breaking All Preconceptions and Proposing Unique and Effective Treatments……Opening the Door to Survival for Those with Nocturnal Emissions and Neurasthenia</p>
<p>There are many children who are diligent, active, mentally strong, and exceptionally intelligent from a young age. However, when they reach the age of fourteen or fifteen, they inexplicably become duller day by day; their thinking becomes sluggish, their actions become foolish, their muscles become thin, and their spirits become even more depressed, losing their usual lively attitude.</p>
<p>If such a phenomenon is slightly investigated, we can know that the reason is nothing more than committing masturbation. Because the result of masturbation is nocturnal emission, so more than 90% of young people in maturity suffer from severe masturbation, and at the same time suffer from nocturnal emissions and neurasthenia of varying degrees.</p>
<p>For the treatment of nocturnal emissions, because of the many unreasonable drugs filling the market, patients often feel great pain. It must be known that the symptoms of nocturnal emission are caused by the relaxation of the seminal gate and nerve excitement. It is necessary to consider the effectiveness of both aspects, then the nocturnal emission medicine can be effective after taking it. After graduating from the Russian Labor Medical University, I have confirmed through years of clinical experiments that "Nai Er Si Nocturnal Emission Tablets" are the most suitable for treating nocturnal emissions and seminal leakage. This medicine is most effective for those who drip two or three drops of semen after defecation and urination, have nocturnal emissions during the day, have frequent erotic dreams at night, and have nocturnal emissions up to once a day. It is best to also take "Buti Kang" to recover from the weakness after nocturnal emissions, which makes it easier to recover.</p>
<p>Reader's Corner</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>Recognition of Italian Annexation</h3>
<p>— Li Xuelian</p>
<p>A few days ago, the newspaper reported that other countries would recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, as a wedge to form a European fascist front. This news became more and more confirmed after Italian Foreign Minister Ciano arrived in Berlin. On the 26th, according to news from the capital of Yugoslavia: "Reuters reported that the Yugoslav government will announce the recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia within days. This step is in fact tantamount to Yugoslavia joining the sphere of influence of Italy and Germany." In this way, Germany's "recognition" has undoubtedly become a reality.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that Italy and Germany, two European fascist countries, are joining hands. Everyone is a country of aggressive militarism, clamoring to acquire new colonies. It goes without saying that Abyssinia was the first to become their victim; and it is also well known that many small European countries, as well as the fertile land of the Soviet Union, have subsequently become their "forbidden fruits." In order to acquire new colonies and re-divide the world, militaristic fascist countries naturally have to promote war. Their recent support for the Spanish rebels, which led to an international civil war, is one example.</p>
<p>Since World War I, people have become very tired of the inhuman war, and no one wants to cause these cruel war disasters again. Therefore, as the threat of World War II becomes increasingly urgent, the formation and increasing growth of the world's anti-war and anti-fascist movements to defend peace is also inevitable. The peace movement and the flames of war are two opposing situations, and they rise and fall with each other. Fascists have to create an atmosphere that promotes this crisis in order to expand the crisis of war. What is especially important is to form a fascist international organization—although they themselves often have contradictions, they turn into this possibility in certain common situations.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is extremely natural for Germany to use the recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia to overcome the broken gap between the two fascist countries and to promote the smooth formation of the international fascist front. Although the recent dissolution of the Austrian Internal Guard has not been enough to affect the relationship between the two countries, it is still not enough to destroy this possibility. Yugoslavia's response to this "recognition" shows the international impact of the combination of these two fascist countries.</p>
<p>However, it does not seem to be a very clever means to promote the combination of the international fascist front at the expense of Abyssinia, because in this way, the "Manchukuo" in the Far East can be "recognized" in the same way, right?…………</p>
<p>The militarists in the Far East are gradually tending to fascism, and perhaps in the future, there will also be the possibility of joining the European fascist front? If so, then those who uphold peace will feel even more difficult, and the crisis of war will become even more tense. How will we save peace?—This is what we urgently need facts to answer. For this reason, we must especially consolidate our peace front.</p>
<h3>Le Peiyuan (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>Turn a corner and go in again, and I can't help but be stunned. My nerves are hit hard. What to say? This inevitable fire pit is buried in the metropolis!</p>
<p>On both sides of the street are connected bungalows. There are not many rooms in each bungalow. Upon entering the door, there is a large wooden screen obstructing the view. Behind the screen is a small courtyard. The rooms on both sides are divided into many rooms. There is not much furniture in each room, except for a large pit that occupies half of the room, there are only indispensable things such as broken tables. On the paper windows, it should be a miracle, there are also small square glasses, which are about two feet square, which is really beautiful. There is also a piece of red cloth hanging on the small glass!</p>
<p>The foul smell wafts from the house to the street. If you have a shallow stomach, you can't help but feel nauseous.</p>
<p>The copper coins rang in people's hands, humming unknown tunes and some obscene words, and strode into the courtyard. The girls, no, at least over thirty years old, are more like pigs and sheep waiting to be slaughtered than girls, squinting at each customer. But no one says anything. If you think that one can vent your desires, then without any procedures, run in, put down the red cloth glass curtain, and close the door at the same time. The price of copper coins is not very high, and you can solve all your requirements.</p>
<p>Men are constantly coming in and out, and the red glass curtain that can be seen is also hung up for a while and put down for a while. God, that room on the south side has been put down five or six times in a short time! If you add up the statistics for the whole day, this number is so alarming! Heaven!</p>
<p>In order to grab hard-to-get food, each time, they finally use powder to cover their pale faces, leaning against the corner of the door and smiling shallowly at people. On the door lamp outside the door, it is clearly written "Fourth Class Lower Place," and because of this, the lowest hope is that they have no way to obtain it.</p>
<p>Walking out of the street, I want to tell the nearly dying young master what I saw: the people in the fire pit are crying, hoping to break free from the ruthless shackles placed on them!</p>
<p>Note: Third, the third, thirteenth, and twenty-third days of the lunar calendar.</p>
<h3>Elementary Questions of Life</h3>
<p>— Zhu Bei</p>
<p>——One of "Human Grass"</p>
<p>When life gave the first of its cruel blows to my head, memory recorded it for me: I was ten years old.</p>
<p>Ten years old, this is in a child's ears—for me, it should be a wonderful, charming word! That word, two years before that—when I was still an eight-year-old child—gave me an excessive temptation and glimmer: Opposite our residential area—a pile of common people's housing called "Eastern Houses"—there was a grand walled gate called "Wang Mansion," which was black and solemn, and always closed. Every day, when I stood at the entrance of the alley, I was occupied by a strange, almost mysterious mood, thinking about what kind of world was inside this big black door? What kind of people lived there—maybe "officials," maybe "big rich men"? Definitely!</p>
<p>But I heard that there was also a "garden" there……!</p>
<p>However, finally, there was a time when that black and gloomy</p>
<h3>On Gifts</h3>
<p>— Shi Ying</p>
<p>In recent years, businesses have all been using gifts as a means of promotion. This can be called a social trend, reaching its peak for a time. Indeed, there's a feeling that without this, it would not be enough to attract customers. However, truly meaningful gifts are rarely seen. This time, for the 30th anniversary of the Wu Zhou Pharmacy and the opening of its new building, the gifts were not what people generally expected, such as soaps, perfumes, or medicines. Therefore, they were not particularly interested in the commemorative gifts. When the company held the ceremony on National Day and sent out invitations, they included a set of three commemorative badges. Attendees wore them on their lapels. After touring the entire new building, at the exit, they could exchange a white round token for a large box of commemorative gifts. The box had a very bright red original sample of the new [亚林沙而, Ya Lin Sha Er]. It was made of flower-painted iron. At first glance, it looked like a bottle of [亚林沙而, Ya Lin Sha Er]. The back was printed with a picture of the new building. Above it, it said "Commemorating the Opening of the Wu Zhou Building." Below, it said "Respectfully Presented by the Company." The bottom of the bottle had a lock that could be opened with a key. On the right side, it said, "[亚林沙而, Ya Lin Sha Er]. Disinfects and kills germs. A necessity for every family. Happiness in all seasons." On the left side, it said, "Promote the popularization of family education and cultivate children's saving habits." During this grand and solemn commemorative occasion, giving a thrifty savings bank deeply imprinted on children's minds and spread throughout families, it is truly a meaningful item. (2) A medicine cabinet for external use. A square iron box with beautiful colors. The box's surface has an image of the new building. On the left and right are red crosses, subtly implying the Double Tenth. The four corners of the cross have "Home Travel" and "Better Safe Than Sorry." Inside the box are instructions. All injuries to the skin, such as burns from water and fire, cuts, insect bites, and abrasions, can be completely treated with this one box. The contents of the box, such as red oil ointment, hemostatic powder, adhesive bandages, gauze, and cotton, are all readily available. It is a necessary item for family travel and has many times the value compared to cosmetics. (3) A glass paperweight. It is made of square glass. Inside, there is a panoramic view of the new building. The upper left corner has a posthumous portrait of the former general manager, Xiang Songmao. The upper right corner says "Double Tenth Festival, Year 25 of the Republic of China" and "Commemorating the Opening of the New Building." Placing one on the desk is a permanent and practical memento. (4) Four commemorative soap bars. These are specially made samples of Gu Ben Soap. The soap has an image of the new building printed on it and a fragrant scent. Looking at all four commemorative gifts, other than the soap which can be used up, the other three will not only last for a long time but can also serve as permanent mementos. What is meant by "commemorative" is the ability to exist permanently. It is said that since the distribution of these commemorative gifts, people from all walks of life consider them to have commemorative value. Therefore, some who had the badges but did not claim the gifts went to the counter on the second and third days. Some who did not have tokens asked others to get them, all considering it a meaningful gift that they had to have as a memento. Among the four, the savings bank is the most widespread. Not only do children love it and can't put it down, but adults of all ages welcome it. At this time of the New Life Movement, advocating thrift and savings is also a virtue. It is appropriate that everyone praises it. It is now said that the company's commemorative gifts are no longer available since the Double Tenth commemorative period has passed. However, the [亚林沙而, Ya Lin Sha Er] savings bank is still being given away at the retail department. It can be obtained by making a purchase. Therefore, those who love it can buy practical items and also get a beloved treasure pot for thrift and savings. Don't miss the opportunity. This article is written to inform those who missed out.</p>

<p>The doors of the big mansion were opened, and many people were gathered outside, along with many carriages and sedan chairs. There were also many people like "Big Good Olds," swaying in and out of the doorway. Inside, looking deep within, there were musicians playing, and many strange, beautiful things to eat and play with. It was said to be the tenth birthday of the first "young master" of the Wang family in the "Wang Mansion"—Old Master Wang was over seventy years old and only had this one young master, making him incredibly rare.</p>
<p>At that time, my mother had said to me, "When we get better, when Son is ten years old, we'll have so many good things too."</p>
<p>No one understood the melancholy in my mother's words, weighed down by life; I, an eight-year-old child, firmly remembered that enticing phrase: ten years old!</p>
<p>Ten years old! But our days did not "get better" as my mother had hoped; on the contrary, they got worse day by day. The people in those "Eastern houses" were all so "indecent," not even comparable to the servants of the Wang Mansion across the street. Life was so difficult for them, and they had completely lost hope in life. The bald "Hui person" (Note: Muslim) who worked in the yarn factory and whose back was bent from working, would eat a bowl of cold rice and a three-copper-coin beef soup every night. He would then vent his anger with his woman, fighting, crying... The unemployed merchant next door who made fake "fortune tickets" would sneak home past midnight to sleep, afraid of being caught and imprisoned one day. The fresh fish seller would throw all the money he earned into "flower clubs," and when he lost money, he couldn't even pay the license fee. While doing business, he was arrested and locked up. Life had turned its back on them. Only the broker who worked for the XX person's cloth shop could live comfortably, sharing a building with his mistress. He would often open his mouth, revealing a row of ugly gold-inlaid teeth, and utter obscene, vulgar laughter...</p>
<p>In that year, when our lives had declined so much that it was disheartening, everyone couldn't help but look at that XX product's foreign cloth broker with a special—almost admiring—gaze. And I, having turned ten, relied on the "neighborly" relationship to be sent to that broker to "learn business." Every day, he would take me to the XX foreign cloth shop, where I would do nine hours of rough work like sweeping, wiping tables, and serving food, listening to those strange languages that sounded like birds chirping, which I could never understand.</p>
<p>It was at that time that the first cruel test of life fell upon me—and I was ten years old!—When they set up a peddler's stall and wanted me to follow the adults to call out sales in the alleys, an unbearable shame suffocated me. I refused to shout a single word, even to death. My face turned red.</p>
<p>"A child so stubborn! You need to be a bit courageous to make a living! So delicate, go be a young master! Will you shout or not: 'Mercerized foreign cloth, scratch-scratch call:...' Will you shout or not!"</p>
<p>I didn't shout—I finally didn't shout! But that night, when I went home, they beat me severely—I don't know when I was sent home—I seemed to see my mother crying by my side.</p>
<p>"I'm ten years old," I thought vaguely. However, the days passed, and my injuries eventually healed. Life was still as bad as ever, and the days were still as gray. But from then on, I didn't have to see that ugly smile with the gold teeth again. That year had passed; yes, I was ten years old.</p>
<p>But, "You need to be a bit courageous to make a living!" I thought maybe that was a bit right?</p>
<h3>Frontier</h3>
<p>— Yi Yi</p>
<p>Because of a slight delay at Yanshan, I was caught by the night not long after leaving there. The boundless wilderness was as if it had just crawled out of an inkwell, without a shred of light. The sky full of stars was also covered by dark clouds.</p>
<p>"See, see, isn't it late now? It's at least forty miles to Jiaodian... In this desolate wilderness, neither village ahead nor shop behind... God only knows what will happen!... " My old companion was nagging again, murmuring in a low voice, seemingly wanting me to hear, yet not wanting to say it outright. Thus, he vented his accumulated resentment on the horse, scolding sharply, the long whip cracking the heavy silence in the air. In this way, the tired horse, burdened by the pain, began to jolt violently a few times, but soon it returned to its slow pace, like a snail.</p>
<p>"Look, the sky is so overcast and the air is so stuffy. If it starts raining, and the mountain streams rush down, we'll really be in trouble!" The old companion slowly spoke, while lighting the mast lamp that was mostly blackened by smoke.</p>
<p>"Then hurry up a bit!"</p>
<p>"Hurry up a bit? Animals don't like walking in the dark. What's the use of hurrying! If we had delayed a little less, interfered a little less (meddling), we could have reached Jiaodian earlier... Humph, you didn't listen when I told you not to interfere! What happened? Wasn't it a live burial? Let me tell you, sir! A widow who steals a man must be buried alive. That's the custom in the frontier. Pity is pity, but what can you do!"</p>
<p>"This is too barbaric! Such things don't happen in the city!"</p>
<p>"Then you can only blame the countryside for being bad!"</p>
<p>Thus, the tragic scene of the live burial at Yanshan revolved in my mind: the village chief's ferocious face, the cold, indifferent faces of the onlookers, and the various taunts and vicious curses... That woman, that unfortunate woman with a pair of large, dark, and lively eyes, she made me admire her. I couldn't find a hint of fear on her face. Health and anger flushed her cheeks. She shouted loudly, "I did it! Because I am a woman! I want to do it... Come on, bury me! You shameless, shameless demons!..." Then she was knocked into the pit with that terrible blow. The village chief covered her with the first shovelful of dirt. On the other side, the young man was tied tightly to a tree. He endured the spitting and beating from any man or woman! He didn't say a word, nor did he cry out in pain. Finally, the village chief cut off one of his ears.—He was released... This terrible scene appeared one after another...</p>
<p>I glanced at my old companion. He was muttering something. The dim mast lamp couldn't break through the darkness, but it was the only light in this wilderness!</p>
<p>The cart moved dully, like a snail. No matter how angrily the whip cracked, it ignored it completely.</p>
<p>Suddenly, several sharp gunshots chased from the road behind. The drawn-out "shriek" seemed to cut several cracks in the darkness. The horse jumped wildly a few times and ran a few steps forward. The old driver twisted his body and said painfully, "It's over, it's over!..."</p>
<p>But what do we have? Thinking of this, I felt relieved. I peeked out from the gap in the cart cover. What was there besides darkness!</p>
<p>"Let fate decide!" The old driver slowly drove the horse, turning one ear towards the rear. We only breathed a sigh of relief after walking half a mile. But the cart had already been grabbed from behind by someone and couldn't move forward. I was surrounded by terror. I heard the person's rapid panting—</p>
<p>"Sir! Save me, I've been shot by bandits... Sir, I'm afraid they're still chasing me..."</p>
<p>Then, I felt relieved. The old driver stopped, picked up my walking stick, and jumped out of the cart very nimbly. I knew he was probably feigning, but the words of pain from that person had already proved that he was overthinking.</p>
<p>"It's you!..." The old driver exclaimed in surprise. When I jumped out of the cart and borrowed the light of the mast lamp, I saw clearly that he was the young man from Yanshan who had had his ear cut off.</p>
<p>"Yes... it's great that it's you... truly..." The young man unfolded a bitter smile on his blood-stained face. We helped him onto the cart. He pointed to his leg; he had been shot.</p>
<p>I was about to ask him why he had encountered bandits, but he waved his hand at the driver: "Drive quickly, don't let them catch up!" The old driver then grabbed the walking stick and hit the horse's buttocks one after another. The horse ran madly.</p>
<p>"Sirs!... "After a while, the young man said intermittently, "I truly love that woman, even though she had lost her husband... But she was buried alive like that for me! How heartbroken I am!... Alas! I was angry, I almost went crazy. I wanted to avenge her. So, I secretly ran to the village chief's house... I, I killed him!... I..." The young man buried his face in his hands and cried!</p>
<p>Silence fell. Only the old driver's heavy sigh could be heard, as well as the sound of the whip hitting the horse's buttocks.</p>

<p>Ah Q</p>
<p>He ran back to the Land God Temple in panic. The local bully, acting as an accomplice, stormed in. From then on, Ah Q added a layer of suffering from being searched and bankrupt. He didn't want to curse Master Zhao, he didn't blame the bully, nor could he blame Wu Ma. He only hated the small mouth of the laborer who received him. Although he had a fierce fight with the small mouth, it didn't help his life at all. Driven by hunger, he had to go to the Jingxiu Nunnery to steal the turnips of the weak, but it didn't help his future life either. So he had to say goodbye to his beloved hometown.</p>
<p>He went to the city to make a living with a male companion who shared the same fate. Although it was said that he was helping out at the Bai Xing's house, "Things are more expensive away from home, and people are cheaper in the countryside." The ridicule and oppression that Ah Q received from the people in his village were not necessarily reciprocated with affection and respect in the city. As for the old Master Bai, he would never be better than Master Zhao.</p>
<p>Ah Q, who was a good laborer who would harvest wheat when asked to harvest wheat, hull rice when asked to hull rice, row a boat when asked to row a boat, and chop wood when asked to chop wood, would also have the complaint of "being harsh to people and busy with work." Master Bai was not only not better than Master Zhao, but was even more cruel. Since Ah Q could not help out at the Bai's house, he certainly could not return home empty-handed, so he took a risk. The day he returned home in brocade robes, looking down on the village, although the villagers each held the mentality of "rather be respectful than slow," they would not misunderstand that Master Bai could have recruited Ah Q as his son-in-law out of love for talent, nor would they misunderstand that Ah Q could have picked up a piece of gold on the road.</p>
<p>Therefore, Ah Q, who was dressed in brocade, not only did not truly gain new respect, but made people even more afraid and wary of him. Master Zhao said in anger and shame...</p>
<p>However, even if the Zhao family had not been robbed, Ah Q could not escape the fate of being shot. Whether he was the mastermind of the robbery of the Zhao family by colluding with bandits was not really a problem.</p>

<p>Opening "Rainy Journey"</p>
<p>Dark, foggy, overcast skies. Dark, black, heavy rain. Fine, soft rain falls without stopping. Muddy, muddy, muddy roads are difficult to walk. The north wind assaults the face. The wanderer's clothes are soaked. The road is long and arduous for thousands of miles. Going, going, going, the journey is difficult. Tears fall ceaselessly. The steps are faltering and weary. I hate my family's decline. Worried thoughts fill my days. Helplessly, I visit my relatives. Separated, separated, separated from my family. My resources are exhausted. My stomach is empty. My eyes are dizzy. I limp. I fear that I will never see my mother again on this journey. I think, think, think, my thoughts want to break. His heart is broken. His eyes are dizzy. His steps are more staggered. The road is slippery. The road is muddy and ankle-deep. My strength is exhausted. I fall in the mud. My breath is faint. Only one breath remains. The rain falls even harder than before. My wandering soul dreams of returning home.</p>

<h3>Mr. Ma Yanxiang's Impressions of the Soviet "Drama Festival"</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The largest theater can hold over ten thousand spectators. Established actors are at least thirty years old. The world-renowned Soviet "Drama Festival" has been held this year, and only Mr. Ma Yanxiang represented China for the first time this year. The Drama Festival has closed, and Mr. Ma has returned to China, bringing us, of course, some fresh materials regarding the arts.</p>
<p>The development of Soviet drama is a pioneer among the countries of the world, which is an undeniable fact. In terms of theaters, Moscow alone has more than sixty, all of which are state-run. The Soviet government's emphasis on art, the architecture of theaters, the spirit of actors, and everything else are all worth referring to by countries around the world. Everyone has such an impression in their minds. Yesterday, Mr. Ma arrived in Shanghai, and the writer had an occasional opportunity to meet him at his residence, asking him for his impressions of this Soviet Drama Festival. According to what he told us:</p>
<p>One: The "audience seating" in Soviet theaters is relatively large, accommodating tens of thousands of spectators, and the smallest can accommodate more than two thousand people. Every theatrical performance is "fully packed with audiences, mostly workers and farmers. This can be said to be unique in the world, but there is such a good phenomenon in the Soviet Union. The level of Soviet culture can be imagined. Now, in the Soviet Union, very few children over the age of eight are illiterate.</p>
<p>"Soviet actors are not perfunctory. For every script staged, the rehearsal time must be at least half a year. On the morning of the performance, regardless of whether the script has been performed before, it must be rehearsed once or twice more. Even if it is a familiar play that has been performed hundreds of times, the actors do not feel troubled. This is also a spirit that the world, at least my country, does not have.</p>
<p>"The training of an actor or the success of an actor is not a coincidence, nor can it be made into a star overnight through a few newspaper and magazine praises. Training an actor requires at least seven or eight years of stage experience, and at the same time, life experience also needs to be experienced before there is an opportunity to play a supporting role. Moreover, practical acting skills and theory must be constantly studied until death. An established actor in the Soviet Union is at least thirty years old, and so are actresses, which is not comparable to our country's emphasis on youth and beauty. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>"Yi Hua" Gleanings</h3>
<p>Yi Hua's new film "Guangling Tide" is a great masterpiece of revolutionary history, which has recently been completed. It was screened for the first time in the company's screening room yesterday, and it was praised as Chen Kengran's unprecedented contribution.</p>
<p>"Guangling Tide" is a great production with revolution as the warp and love as the weft. Yi Hua spent more than 80,000 yuan, truly sparing no expense. All the technical personnel were mobilized, breaking all records of domestic films. Stars such as Yuan Meiyun, Wang Yin, Lu Ming, Jiang Yiqiu, Guan Hongda, Liang Dusheng, etc., worked especially hard, and the results were particularly remarkable.</p>
<p>Fang Lin's "Sequel to Avatar Girl" and Xu Sulin's "Sea and Sky Lovers" are being worked on day and night, working hard, and are expected to be completed within the year.</p>
<p>Yue Feng expressed that he will write and direct a very realistic great film close to national defense, so that people can understand that he has not changed his past style. Chen Kengran will direct Pan Zigenong's "Elastic Children 1-", etc., after "Guangling Tide" is screened, it will start filming.</p>
