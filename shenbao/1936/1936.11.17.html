<h3 id="c66">德國廢止自由通航條欵的意義 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— 隅</p>
<p>凡爾賽和的終於成僞「死的文字」了。近數年來。德國的外交上一舉一動。都足以影饗「凡爾賽」的產婆法國。「凡爾賽」的產兒國聯。凡爾賽的另一附產品捷克。以及和三者都有深切關係的蘇聯。最近德國政府照會十四國政府。宣佈廢比凡爾賽和約第十二部分所規定。德國境內河道。如萊茵河如奧特河如厄爾柏河如尼門河如丹瑙河如基爾運河等的國際自由航行的條欵。我們也可以從上述幾方面來觀察此舉所引起的影響。當然。德國是早有把凡爾賽和的全部撕毁的决心的。一九三二年。國社黨登台的前一年。我們在洛桑會議中。已見到德國人把那現任經濟部長夏赫特所認爲「流盡德國人的血」的賠欵廢除。一九三三年德國要求地位平等而退出國聯。一九三五年為擴張軍備而廢止凡爾賽和的軍事條欵。一九三六年爲萊茵武裝而同時廢止羅加諾保安公約。目前的廢止德國境內河流的國際自由航行。是國社黨一貫的手法。而在外交政策上。又是呼應其他法西國家而與歐洲和平陣綫對抗的一種表示。自七月德奧協定成立後。兩個歐洲法西國家。已不像前兩年一樣為爭奪奧國的覇權。而相互醜詆。最近意外長齊亞諾有柏林之行。這結果。不但兩國盡釋舊嫌。並且在政治經濟上。還成立許多秘密恊定。那就是對於奧國。成立諒解。對於丹瑙河經濟問題劃分勢力範圍。對於未來羅加諾會議。採一致行動。聯絡英國而壓迫法國。削弱和平陣綫的勢力而造成反蘇聯戰錢。德意旣有密的在前。那末德國對於意國外交行動。自然要作同聲之應。本月十二日。意奧匃三國會議的結果。議定書中承認奧匃兩國。有要求軍備平等權利。這不啻對於凡爾賽和約。又是一個嚴重的打擊。德國旣有默契於前。亦必有表示於後。廢止國際自由航行的條欵。就一變而爲恰當其時的應景點綴了。</p>
<p>德國廢止國際自由航行條欵以後。最受影響的國家。當然是瑞士與捷克。因爲這兩國都是無海口的國家。必須經由國際的河流而通海。照凡爾賽和的第十二部分的規定。設立幾個國際委員會。管理萊茵河奧特河厄爾柏河尼門河與丹瑙河。其目的就在給這些國家以便利。今德國一旦廢止國際航行條欵。捷克對於厄爾柏河與丹瑙河的國際航道。將無由利用。而對於德國境內的漢堡與斯丹因自由港口。也將無由通達。在這意義上。捷克確是受了一個不小的打擊。再從另一方面觀之。給捷克以直接的打擊。也就是給法國以問接的示威。因爲小協的國中。捷克是法國最忠實的同盟者。又是蘇聯最親近的友人。德國欲在中歐膨脹她的勢力。欲推行其東向發展政策。欲聯合歐洲日耳曼民族而成一大日耳曼民族帝國。都有對她的中歐的「眼中釘。」加以打擊的必要。况且在這中歐反和的運動抬頭的今日。狡獪的國社黨人。也需要藉口替日耳曼民族解除凡爾賽條約的束縛。來轉移國內飢餓民衆的視綫呢。</p>

<p>所列號數</p>
<p>啟箱取單出貨、陸在供職時、曾以鉛質仿造各行鑰匙、共有七枚、近以窮極無聊、乃異想天開、卽以偽鑰匙啟箱　單、赴各棧騙貨、至最近得悉法租界紫萊街敬記報關行、受漢口仁豐客家委託代辦上海報關手續、該客家卽以値洋五百五十元之蓮心十箱、交招商局江安輪船</p>

的特殊發展，凡有一技之長的業餘運動家，到了足以號召觀衆的時期，無有不想到美國去上海，最近如央國的潘萊，也已正式簽了字，决定明年一月到美國去和梵恩斯比賽。據說這一决的比賽，潘萊的報酬是二萬五千美金，並保證潘氏在一年內可得十萬金的收人。無怪以前生活平常的鐵梵二氏，現在都已成爲當翁了。

<p>申報醫藥專刊爲全國鄉鎭小學兒童健康問題呼籲（上）  解玉衡　　一，今日之鄉鎭衛生與鄉鎭小學兒童　　我國近來的農村復興運動，總算是風起雲湧，盛極一時，鄉鎭衛牛的設施，也就應命而生，然而終因對於農村復興運動的使命，未能有遠大悠久普遍根本的意義，鄕村衛生的發展，也就居於雷風暴雨中終日動搖着，分折一般農村運動中的衛生工作，大的可歸納爲二類，一種是救濟式的，其中的衛生工作，與慈善事業混合爲一，僅不過施診給藥而已，完全失却鄉村衛生的本義，一種是表瞪式的，其中的衛生工作雖然較爲完善，然仍帶有前者的色彩，中國的地方，雖然丟了東北的四省，但是所有的農村還不在少數，若是像這樣救濟式或表瞪式的衛生工作，未免太沒有普遍遠大的意義了。　　按李著中國鄉村衛生問題中所載之中國鄉村爲升概況調查表，莫大的中國，現辦有鄉村衛生者僅十七處，中央設立者一，縣或市辦者二，縣市與中央或私人團體等合辦者八，私人團體或學校舉辦者六，總計十七處，工作人員僅一百八十七人，盅今天日之鄉村衛生情況，由此可見矣，且其中深入農村辦理農村衛生而顧及鄉鎭小學兒童健康者，僅有定縣之平敎會實騐區等數處，縣立醫院雖列於鄕村範圍內，然其工作僅限於縣之城池，終歲動動的農民，處於生活艱苦貧動交迫之農民，受其惠者有幾，鄕鎭間小學兒童之健康受其保障者更有幾何，今日中國鄉鎭衛生與鄉鎭小學兒童健康之關係明矣！　　二，鄕鎭小學學生不健康之狀况　　自從一九二五年北平第一衛生事務所提倡開辦學校衛生後，各地較爲繁榮的都市均斷斷續續的開辦學校衛生，自今統計起來，還是很有限的幾處，衛生署於一九三四年收集各處體格檢査的統計，統計有缺點者佔百分之九十五以上，其中患營養不良者百分之十，患皮　病者百分之三十，患目疾者百分之五十，患牙病者百分之四十，患扁桃腺病者百分之二十五，此外患其他病者爲數尙屬不少，衛生署又曾與敎育部合作，檢査專科以上學生之體格，的二萬餘人，其中有疾病者達七千餘人之多，且有三分之一係羅有慢性傳染病，從這二個統計看起來，我國學生的體格如此之不健全，影響整個民族的健康是無疑矣！都市中的學生，生活較爲優裕，環境方面因爲物質文明而得到不少的健康上帮助，其體格尙且如此之不健全。且專科以上的學生的家境，比普通一般人總要優越得多，其體格亦屬於此之不健全。　　試思居於貧愚病私四大病中的農村兒童，他們的體格應該壞到什麼程度，若是有幾位眞誠爲農村兒童健康作想的專家，或者是一位地方的行政長官，能够親自足踏實地的往農村去走一躺，（縣城不是農村）可以見到許許多多的長瘡害眼跛足，痄腮，爛手爛足，禿瘡，拖鼻涕，麻臉，骨癆等等羅有疾病的小孩，若是檢査其缺點，可以有百分之百的統計，他們的健康無人保障，他們的疾病無人醫治，與城市上的兒童比一比，可算是相差天地之遠，那時也就無用爲他們的健康問題呼籲，一定會得到專家或者是行政長官的憐憫，鄉鎭間的兒童是熟烈地的在這種慾望下，期望着專家及行政長官由憐憫的心而爲共健康謀保障的設施。　　三，鄉鈸兒童健康的重要　　中國以農立國，農村土地占百分之九十五以上，農民占百分之八十五以上，國家的基礎，國家的强弱，國家的經濟，完全是建築在整個的農村，復興農村的運動，在國難森嚴危機四伏的時候，是迫切需要的工作，國難無論是若何的嚴重，對外要始終的服從政府的應付方策，對內應更加努力於農村的建設，診治農村中的貧愚弱私，準備做應付國難的後循，晏陽初先生在農村運動的使命中說「今日農村運動的主要目標，要特別注重在農村的靑年男女，這些靑年他不但可以爲繼往的好手，又可以爲未來的良工，他們興可以做救護中國的生力軍，改造中國的挺進隊，姑就定縣來作例，全縣四十萬人之中，就有八萬是靑年農民，以全國四萬萬人計算，中國的農村靑年，至少當在八千萬左右，從前項羽壞秦興楚，只杖八千子弟，中國今日如果集中精神只要把這八千萬的靑年農民改造過來，我想無論什麼國難都常得起，甚麼國恥都雪得掉，一切建設，也纔有安定的地盤，鞏固的根基。」今日的農村靑年如此重要，我們需要國家强盛，那麼對於未來的靑年農民——鄉鎭兒童——就應積極的施以良好的敎養，使其能够繼續努力國家的建設工作，復興中國的權威，故今日鄕鎭之兒童有直起急追繼續努力中國復興的責任，不僅是都市兒童將來所能勝任的，在今日中國的情形下，努力此項的工作能有幾處，目前的靑年農民沒有能够改造，未來的靑年農民又沒有去施以適宜的敎養，這樣下去，對於農村的復興，國家的建設，國難的應付，以及做應付國難的後循，是依賴何人，現在除去了要積極改造靑年的農民，還要對於未來的靑年農民給以良好的敎養。再從歷史上說，從古以來的許多英雄豪傑，能够成大功之大業的，大都是「鄕下老」而來自田間，從這二點上可以窺見到鄉鎭兒童敎養的重要，又何况農村的兒童體格惡劣而又多病的現在呢？現在農村兒童的敎養，敎的方面雖有義敎，然仍不普及，養的方面現在是誰在注意，有了有智識的農民，沒有健全身體的農民，這樣怎會强國，鄉鎭兒童健康的重要，是無可諱言的了。中國防癆恊會三年來工作概況及今後計劃  顏福慶　　本會由上海市長吳鐵城先生聯絡中外各界領袖及醫界巨子共同發起，於民國二十二年十月二十一日假霞飛路市府招待處舉行成立大會，當推吳鐵城爲名譽會長，牛惠牛爲理事長，李廷安爲副理事長，顏福慶，翁之龍，布美等爲常務理事，民國二十三年，牛惠生因病請假，理事長一席，由副理事長李廷安依法兼代，二十四年理事長牛惠生迭請辭職，乃於是年九月中第五次常務理事會議席上照准，推陸伯鴻爲理事長，二十五年十月舉行年會之際，照章改選理監事，結果吳鐵城，陸伯鴻，李廷安，顏福慶，黃子方，翁之龍，喬　登，施思明，陳鶴琴，潘公展，干孝英等十一人當選爲常務理事，杜月笙，龐京周，丁福保，錢新之，姚慕蓮，虞洽卿，劉湛恩等七人常選爲監事。茲將三年來工作概况，分述如後：　　（一）微求會員——防癆工作，非一二人或一二個團體的力量所可以做起來的，非要各界人士，共同參與，那是不易收效的。所以本會在成立之後，卽徵求會員並勸寡欵項，以實本會力量，此後更一年一度的舉行一决徵募大會。第一屆徵募大會，於民國二十三年十二月十五日假香港路銀行公會開幕，計微得會員三百人，捐欵一萬八千餘元。二十四年四月六日假吳市長公館舉行第二屆徵募大會開幕禮，徵得會員八百人，捐欵七千三百餘元。本年四月十八日假八仙橋靑年會舉行第三屆徵募大會。計自成立日起至本年六月二十五日止，共收會費，捐欵X光費及銀行利息等共洋三萬五千八百二十八元三角九分。　　（二）宣傳——本會成立之初，除努力進行各項實際工作外，並注意宣傳事項，以期喚醒國人對於防癆運動之注意，並灌輸預防方法，及治療常識。宣傳事項，可以分出兩方面說：　　（一）口頭宣傳——（一）至各學校，各團體，及公共塲所，舉行通俗演講，前後共計四十决，聽講二萬五千人。　　（二）播音演講——在各電台播音演講，共計二十决。　　（三）舉辦勸止吐痰運動——去年及今年各一决，演講十四决，聽衆七千人，並分發勸止吐痰運動特刊，及標語傳單等一萬五千張。　　（二）文字宣傳：　　（一）發行防癆月刋及健康畫報（旬刋），均由本會編輯，按期發行，共計發出十萬份以上。　　（二）張貼各項標語——電車公共汽車之流動廣吿，以及馬路緊要處之牆壁廣吿共計一萬五千份。　　（三）舉行防癆展覽會——二十四年一月，假四川路靑　會舉行防癆展覽會，會期三天，觀衆三千餘人。　　（四）編製防癆衛生掛圖——計四十種，每種印一千份，分發各學校各團體各機關張貼。　　（五）贈送防癆專書——肺病指南，肺病預防法，肺病療養法三種，共計贈出三千份以上　　（六）編製防癆歌詞五種——分發各學校各團體各歌詠會，計送出三千五百份。　　（三）設立診療所——本會爲謀適應社會需要及預防癆病傳播起見，於二十三年六月十四日，在西門西林路創立第一診療所，二十四年年四月一日，在南市多稼路添設第二診療所，二十五年一月七日在西藏路增設第三診療所。惟第二第三診療所因所址合同關係，業已先後遷出。第二診療所現設靑雲路衛生事務所內。第三診療所則因人力單薄，暫予停止，各診所診治病人完全免費。計自各診所成立迄今，市民前往診病者達五千餘人，足証市民患染癆病之一斑。　　此外，並有家庭訪問，由診療所護士於每日上午訪問病家，吿以預防及療養的各種方法，俾患者得知攝生之道，而免傳染家庭。　　本會診療所除診治癆病患者外，並</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言發起「援綏運動」  汶　　國防最前錢的綏遠，一年來敵人進攻陰謀，今日父開始爆發了。我們念誦過去二中全會官言，及蔣委員長聲明，决不再失一寸國十，敵人再來進犯，决予痛擊。這是我國政府對民衆的信誓，我們以萬分的熱誠，擁護這有力的信誓。我們今日要求全國愛國民衆，以一致的熱力，促使這個信誓的實踐。今日敵人已開始再以武力侵犯我國國土，我們要求政府立卽領導民衆，以堅定的抗敵意志，結合全民衆力量，予敵人的進攻以勇猛的還擊。　　十五日本報載中央大學校長羅家倫發表慰勉綏遠將士書，並助一千元醫藥費，又云：「經我們血染的山河，一定永久爲我們所有，民族的生存和榮譽，祗有靠自己民族的頭顱和鮮血，才可保持！這决我看　各位將士塞上的牛活，已認識了我們民族復興的奇葩，正孕育在枯草黃沙的堡壘中等候怒放。我深信各位不久更可以使世界認識我們中華男兒還是獅子，並非綿羊！我們全國同胞的熱血，都願意奔放到塞外的戰壕裏，助各位消減寒威，激勵忠勇憤慨。……現在整個民族的命運，抓在我們手裏，我們大家都無所逃於天地之間！祗有我們血染過的山河，更値得我們和後世的謳歌和愛護！」這是我們全國民衆一致的呼聲。我們表示以十二萬分的熱誠，擁護羅先生這段有力的宣示。　　又見報載，平津各界，已紛紛發起「援綏」運動。恊和大學全體工友，甚至絕食一天，以）天餐資，援助綏軍。綏遠是我國今日國防最前錢，綏遠是我們全體民衆共有的十地，因此，「援绥」運動，决不應限於平津各地。在全國各地，特別在經濟文化中心的上海，應立刻發動一個「援助綏遠運動」。過去蔣委員長五十壽辰，各界購機祝壽的熱烈，我們已看到了，今日在援綏運動上，我們希望看到司樣熱烈而且持久的運動，在全國開展出來。希望在上海立刻成立一個收受捐欵的機關，普遍的發動援綏運動。政府一定愛護這一忠誠的「援綏」運動。　　在外交上說，綏遠匪案的進攻，「友邦」旣明白聲明過，與他們無關，那這事完全屬於我國內政問題，我國政府有權以任何力量勦滅自己國內作亂的土匪。這時對於外交，對於國際友誼，絕對談不到什麼有牽涉的關係，所以我們儘可毫無顧忌的進行「援綏」運動，於政府對外交涉，决無妨碍，而且敵人看到我國人民力量如此偉大，只有稍知顧忌，而反有利於外交的。　　居於全國經濟文化中心地的上海，應立卽發起這一援綏運動，以爲全國倡。再有，報載平地泉方面已有敵軍飛機出現，我們更要求前此民衆呈獻政府的許多飛機，應立卽開到綏遠去，這正是用得着的時候了。我們還可以再來一决二次至無數决的呈獻飛機運動，無限的供給政府爲抗敵而使用。滋補力最豐富的威靈美味麥精魚肝油　　犧牲五萬瓶普遍大贈送　大瓶一元五角買一送一　　威靈麥精魚肝油係用眞正鮮潔挪威鱉魚肝油及眞空濃縮之大麥芽膏，和以芳香美味諸品，經由著名藥師調合而成，乃一最新補肺强身之良劑，現爲普遍各界試服起見，特的正威藥房及各大公司各大藥房代送，大號威靈麥精魚肝油（二磅瓶），每瓶一元五角，買一瓶再送一瓶，電話購買請撥九二五二五，逢生臌脹救星  逢生　　臌脹一病。我國醫家認爲絕症。而西法亦無藥治之方。惟有用刀針開放。然不久仍要臌脹起來。故患者十難一治。自上海正威藥房（二馬路英華街口大舞台對面）發明「臌胀無憂丹」以來。迄今十餘年。活人甚衆。凡患水臌。氣臌。婦女血臌。小兒疳膨等症。經服此丹。無不藥到病除。是以全國醫藥界。認爲破天荒之奇藥。咸樂爲介紹。而此丹功效旣偉且速。病輕者服兩盒可痊。症重者四盒必愈·定價每盒洋五元。說明書函索卽贈「人之將死，其言也善」乎？  因非　　「人之將死，其言也善。」這是句老話了。照中國的慣例，任何東西祗要够得上資格稱一聲「老」，是就成爲鐵律，沒辦法把它否定的。平時呢，大概是由於怕做叛徒，似乎也很少有人敢對這鐵律說一個不字。　　但「人之將死也，其言也眞的是「善」的嗎？我想是未必見得，至少，也是未必盡善的。　　囚犯在將處决的時候，總有一位牧師來代爲祈禱，恩求上帝超拔，但還得附帶一個條伴，那就是要囚犯表示懺悔生前的罪惡。好像這樣一懺悔，罪惡的靈魂便立刻變成爲聖潔，可以上得天堂了。　　遇到這樣的情形，倔强的囚犯是倔强到底的，非惟不肯懺悔，並且還大喊「再過二十年，又是一條好漢！」因爲這樣，使牧師們手足無措也是常有的事。這樣的囚犯，所謂負與諭之職者大抵給他一個謚號，曰：「至死不悟」。是否是「至死不悟」，這裏且暫不說它，但用來證明「人之將死」，「其言也」未必盡「善」，則是綽綽有餘的。　　「至死不悟」的囚犯不大有；一般的囚犯，聞到處决的消息，大半總是面色慘白，或甚至泣不成聲的，這時候宗敎勢力乘隙而進，自然就成爲待宰者的止痛劑，於是要他懺悔，要他在胸口劃十</p>

<p>字，自然也就照辦無誤；但這樣是否就是「將死」的「善」了呢？恐怕也未必見得，說得明白一點，他們大都以爲自己是犯了「罪」，這樣一來，是可以解去些「罪」，庶幾到了「地獄」，可以少受一點「苦刑」，好在這祗是一舉手之勞，又何樂而不爲。所以動機還在於解罪，而不在於爲善。至於牧師們呢，懺悔以後是否會就此卽登天堂，雖連他們自己也不知道，但是讓活着的人們來說他一聲　慈，吸收一些徒衆，於他有些好處，自然更樂予爲之了。　　「歪寢」的囚犯「其言也不善原不可悟的，然而不是「歪寢」者就「善了嗎？也小見得！　　能够「壽終正寢」而又並不是暴病身亡者，在「將死」之時大抵總有一些遺言」，這些遺言，在小民們則總是人欠欠人，養老撫幼這一類：至於名公或是顯宦，那自然就不同了，遺產如何處置之外，總得再加上幾條一勿什麼，二勿怎樣的話，用來顯示他雖在病中，也並未忘記國事和道德。　　躺在病床上猶念念不忘於國事，這或許是事實，但關懷並不就是善」，解釋得絕對一些，有時並且是可以惡」的：要做竊國者的侯，國事就不能不無所用心，此其一：第二呢，卽使想一心爲善，但是因爲他的環境和時代精神所限，結果把砒霜認爲是救世的良藥，於是毒死了人還揚揚自倖其關懷世道及國事之切。　　因之，卽使其動機也善矣，一其言也」却未必見得是「善」。至於動機是否是純正，有許多處也小無可疑，說得不客氣一點，名公顯宦們在病中體衰，神經衰弱時，因爲鑒於在台上時殺人太多，懼罪的心理有時是會更甚於囚犯的：一勿怎樣，二勿怎樣者，有時也正是解罪的心理反映。　　然而，「人之將死」，將不會有「其言也善」了嗎？也不然。不過「其言也善」的，一定得平時所「言」所行者「也善」，那才會「其言也善」，可是那已經是與「人之將死」的意義不同了。　　要平時作惡多端，而於「人之將死」時則「其言也善」，那是不可能的。窓  子明　　窓的對面，是一所破落的小洋房。赭紅色的瓦磚，被長時期的風雨打成灰黯的一片：爬藤草儘可能地的生長着，幾乎把一扇百葉窓都封秘了。在晚秋的寒風中，召租的木板牌彷彿塔尖上的風鈴似的在鐵柵門上打着轉。　　我每天坐在寫字台旁讀書，寫字，聽着召租木牌敲擊着鐵柵柱發出車濁的金質聲音底時候，我總若有所思地呆望着那扇百葉窓，猜想着這小洋房的主人現在不知漂流在何地？有時却又幻想着，在電雷交作的半夜，百葉窓忽然扭斷了爬藤草堅紉的莖葉豁地敞開了，一個披散着頭髮的少婦佇立在窓前，有着兩只發光的眼睛，從窓口飛下來，跪倒在那人字形的舖道上，向天空膜拜，伸訴她如何受屈而死的。於是我馬上闔上窓，把厚絨的窓帘也拉上了。我恐慌着我眞會遇到那樣一個女殭屍似的。　　秋天來了，那金質的聲音整天沒有停歇的時候，我又胆怯地注視着那扇百葉窓，也想冐險去探視裏面倒底封鎖着什麼東西？　　一天，黃昏時候，一輛馬車停在窓下，從車上跳下兩個人，在矇朧的夜色　我分不淸是男的，抑是女的？車夫搬着件籠箱雜物往小洋房裏走去了。我心悖跳着，我想看個竟究，天空忽然飄着雨絲，夜色更濃了，無可奈何地闔上窓，想着洋房裏明天早上或許要發生什麼悲劇！一陣吆喝的呼聲，是馬夫趕着車子走了。　　第二天是個大晴天。我拉開窓帘往對面一看，百葉窓已經打開了，爬藤草的斷莖像蛇一樣吊在窓底下。一個十四五歲的小女兒蹲倒在鋪道上攀摘細小的野菊花，塞滿了身旁的一個竹筐的時候，她才抬起頭來，但是看到我在窓口注視着，旋轉身向洋房門奔去了，一條粗黑的大辮子在背上打着鞦韆。　　馬上洋房門又開了，一個中年婦人携着她的手一同出來。那中年婦人彷彿在什麼地方見過似的，祇向我瞟了一眼，低聲地吩咐小女兒什麼，看她拿着墻角的掃帚，把舖道上翻起的汚泥收拾乾凈了，又携着手消逝在那扇剝落的洋房門裏了。　　我把視錢抬起來，看到樓上百葉窓裏面。是一間精雅的臥室，四壁舖着鵝黃色的花紙，一盞掛着纓絡的吊燈懸在天花板的中央，稍微跕起了脚尖，看到室內有一張柚木的半床，舖着雪百的被褥，沒有一絲摺痕。一只百靈台，四柄矮椅；靠對壁是一對單人沙發，中間嵌着一個托烟盤的黑人模型：側裏壁上有一個鏡框，下面是的天然几上供着一瓶紫紅色的花朵。近窓的一面，沒有看到什麼，或許有一個書架，和一張寫字台　　中年婦人和那個小女兒走上樓來了。小女兒彷彿很疲乏似的倒在沙發裏，很認眞地玩着手裏一朶野菊花。婦人緩緩地走到天然几橫頭，從一只精巧的錦盒裏取出三柱細香，燃了，挿在一個銅香爐裏，深深地拜了下去。拜了四拜，站起來對鏡框呆望着，久久沒有移動她的身體，小女兒也在沙發上睡過去了。　　下半天把百葉窓閉上了，洋房裏就沒有一點聲息，像從前一樣。　　下一天我走到窓前的時侯，又看到婦人在點香，下拜。三天，四天……我也站在窓前成了習慣，直到百葉窓閉上爲止。　　但是我終於記不起在什麼地方見過那婦人。　　又是一天，我起得很早，到輪船碼頭去接一個朋友，走出門口，碰過那個小女兒坐在階台上，她對我一笑，馬上站起來讓路，我隨便向她「早啊」！她羞澀地點了點頭，就跟在我旁邊走路，一路玩弄着辮梢。在我將要呼喚街車的時候，她突然牽住我的衣袖，低聲問着　　「先生，你住在這裏幾年了？　　我執了她的手，「問它什麼？一年多了。　　「那末你，」她抽回了手，「見過有到這洋房裏來問詢的沒有？」她指着自己的屋子。　　「沒有！」我搖搖頭。「她是你的媽媽？」　　她又跑上一步，牽住我的衣袖，「不是，是姑媽。」　　「姑爹呢？」　　「出門三年沒有回來過，……」　　我馬上想起了那個鏡框，恐怕是她姑爹的像片，一個不知下落的丈夫啊！或許她姑媽每天在向神像祈禱，希望那洋房的主人安然歸來！　　我幾乎忘了輪船到埠的時問，想細細盤問小女兒。但是那婦人在樓窓口高聲喊着「阿菊！阿菊！小女兒灑脫了我的手轉身就跑。跑了二步，回頭對我說：「先生，我們明天再見！」</p>

<p>到西貢的第一天  柳明　　船已經靠近碼頭拋錨了。從甲板上望去，碼頭上有無數的人頭在攅動着，人聲異常嘈雜。我不相信這是一個異國的碼頭，因爲從這些攅動着的人們的臉孔，服裝，聲音同舉動上，完全看不出有一點異樣，全都是那樣熟識。他們正在碼頭上蹺起足後跟，伸長頸項在觀望着他們那些新從唐山來的親戚友朋們。　　二星期來的海程完全結束了，自己日夜夢想着的這充滿着新鮮的氣息的西貢，現在已呈現在自己的眼前；也許過五分十分鐘後，我便踏上這新的大陸了　。我興奮地在甲板上擠來擠去的走着，看看岸上有沒有熟識的人。赤道午前毒熱的太陽煎炙着我光赤的頭，使我頓然威到昏暈那樣難受。　　半個鐘頭過了。已　岸的輪船還沒有放下艦橋。站在甲板上的人們等得不耐煩了。一個戴着通帽的人，向旁邊一個靑年人說：　　「外國官廳辦事也一樣的馬虎，爲什麼過了時候還不來？」　　「誰曉得呢？聽說要等騐身和收人頭稅後才准上岸，我想恐怕今天晚上才辦得淸楚吧！」　　驟然，通「馬黎」的吊橋放下來了。幾十個外國的，日本的紳士們，其中也有一兩個闊氣的中國人，他們統統走下船去。甲板上的人用羡慕的眼色送他們走下碼頭。直到他們都坐上汽車，向各處開去之後，才歎氣着說：「咳，有錢人眞舒服呢！」　　經了這一刺激之後，站在甲板上的人們就更加焦燥起來。他們嘰哩咕嚕的埋怨着法國官廳，其中也雜着低聲的咒駡。一個廣東老鄕用沙啞的聲音說：　　「好個，就留我的一輩子，丟那媽個亥！」（未完）播音話劇　　電送劇社　　佛音（九八〇）下午九時至十時　　梅蘿香……李　瑛　　白森鄉……劉亞衛　　馬子英……吳鍍　　秦四天……潘公亮　　筱春蘭……蔡銀輝　　桂媽……　　梅蘿香　　梅蘿香梅蘿香來這裏鼓浪嶼唱戲已是很久，現在散了班正想回到上海去；這時候，上海那個明新舞台的大股東白森卿知道了，特地老遠的來陪她。白森卿已是四十多歲的人，他這樣的對一個剛二十歲的姑娘百般的慇懃，當然是有他的目的的。　　但是當白森卿告訴梅蘿香他給她在明新舞台做新戲的主角，並且在辣斐德路已租好一所新房子，預備回去兩個人同住的時候，突然出於意外的梅蘿香告訴他：她已在這秀麗的鼓浪嶼和一個英俊有爲的靑年馬子英熱戀上了。　　白森卿是個很懂得世故的人，他知道像他自己的年紀决敵不過年輕的馬子英。不過常他知道了馬子英不過在報館裏當個編輯，每月祇拿五十塊錢的薪水，怎麼够梅蘿香那樣過慣奢華生活的女子化用呢？便對她說了許多譏諷的冷語。　　我倆都很年輕，我倆會努力！」梅蘿香這時候似乎是很勇敢的回答他。　　馬子英來了，他體見白森卿在梅蘿香的房裏，他便很明白他倆的關係；不但這些，他更知道梅蘿香曾經嫁過一偭現在已經死了的丈夫。但這正和他自己也曾度過花天酒地的糜爛生活，交結過不少不三不四的女人一樣，祇要今後大家改過，已往的一切是决不計及的。　　然而，他可給梅蘿香一句命令的話：不准白森卿陪她到上海去。　　梅蘿香那時當然一口應允；並目預的好，等馬子英在鼓浪嶼發了財立刻到上海來娶她。……彈詞　　曹笑英玉蜻蜓　　中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻　　何芸芳何琴芳雙珠球　　元昌（一一二〇）下午三時半至四時一刻　　開篇玉蜻蜓備容」　　梧桐葉落已秋天。志貞芸房畫郞顏。他未曾執筆先流淚。想起金君苦萬千。大爺吓，自古道畫容先畫鼻。今朝要畫你，生前一付如玉顏。大爺吓，畫你，鼻正口方眞有樣。雙耳着福傍兩邊。大爺吓，畫你，鳳目蛾眉多風雅。相貌　堂覺自然。大爺吓·畫你是，頭戴方巾飄綾。白玉一塊　中央間。大爺吓，畫你，雙綾襪如雪白。墨烏緞靴足下穿。　爺吓，畫你是，手拿一把眞金扇。玉蜻蜓，一只縣於扇兒邊。大爺吓，畫你是，端坐太史椅。令人可愛　情牽。三太是，一頁丹靑。畫就。纖織玉手掛牆邊。正衣深深來跪拜。抬頭通看倍慘然。大爺吓，苦你只少三分氣。姿態風流似生前。可憐你，眼睜睜對着貧尼看。只爲奴，難畫你與奴說話言。大爺吓，難畫你。芸房吟詩與聯對。走來踱去在奴身邊。大爺吓，難畫你，心根溫柔恩愛奴，問寒問暖將奴憐，大爺吓，曾記得山塘來看戲，普禪勾你到庵間。師徒六個蒙你單愛我。惜玉憐香在枕邊。呌奴養起　絲髮。閒來無事纏金蓮。說道帶我南濠去。同享榮華偕白年。維知你。到庵百日已成疾。形容憔悴不如前。其時你，咳嗽痰中有見血。嚇得貧尼，心中好比滾油煎。六月炎天呌你分床睡。你恨恨之聲無半言。奴是只得依從你。你還，畫夜不分將慾事傳。那一日，佛婆報信眞可恨。說道你，家中妻子幹無天。帶家人大打兵部府。氣得君家病更添。幾番死去還魂轉。嚇得奴，魂膽皆消蕩九泉。後來搜庵尋不着。衆尼僧亦。嚇得幾乎魂升天，幾番驚恐還尤可。無奈難治你病體痊。朝朝看你偏加重。允如燈。內　油明不延。呌貧尼，不好到街坊求問卜。又不好。相請名醫治病危。又不好，到你家中去通報。恐防你妻房，到此要鬧喧天。奴只得，靜守芸房望你好。早晚焚香叩佛天。誰知你，六月念九交半夜。壽限難逃歸了泉。可惜你，萬貫家財多不帶。又撇下，家中姣妻美少年。可惜你，臨終對我雙流淚。眼白洋洋無半言。可惜你，名門宦族官家子。爲何死在我庵閒。可惜你。死無棺槨以缸作。七寸魂牌供裏邊。奴爲你。左思右想無法設。只將你，尸骸埋葬在庵間。那時，哭斷肝腸欲要隨君去。怎奈，腹中有孕還未生全。又想今生下遺孤子。君家可望有香烟。大爺吓，張氏娘娘得今還把望。望你歸家，去取功名列帝前。那知你，已死在我庵堂內。望穿眼底永不轉家園。大爺吓，你死之後苦死我。今朝，畫你容顏哭聲天。大爺吓，奴如今。千言萬語頻頻訴。你爲何，一句全無對我言。縱然是，紙上眞容無可用。只落得，鏡中花月水中天。我只得，日夜焚香把法華經來念。超度我郞去登仙。　　蔣賓初三笑　　新聲（一三八〇）下午七時至八時　　開篇「四時景」　　一枝「玉梅」報春回。「莘園」景色得重開。絲絲「楊柳靑」色服。「灼灼」桃花艷霞堆。「燕燕」隨風爭相逐。「胡蝶」穿花興未闌。刹那間。滿園春色「競芳」裏。一聲　。「杜宇」。歸去促春殘。「麗蓮」放。「倩蘋」繁。月「娟娟」。風「徐來」。聽雷「賽珍」樓。乘凉「吉亭」畔。窗外幽「蘭君」記取。「芑香」滿室入我懷。又只見。月揚「明輝」銀河潔。畫屛初展「織雲」飛。一片「光照」萬里白。多少。「秋心」應向此中看。黃花瘦。「耐霜」寒。「孤雁」聲高入雲端。那曉得。一夜「秋風」併秋雨。平添了。幾重「秋痕」濕蒼苔。「胡茄」奏。「逸葦」翻。「古松」巍巍風前站。孤衾難眠頻。「夢石」呵凍臨窗賦「雪懷」。只道是。「獻齋」夜冷難度寂。幸賴那。盆裏「耐芳」伴歲寒。「醉翁」之意聊可慰。歌唱　　現代歌劇社　　李樹德（九四〇）下午三時至四時　　空中音樂　（徐燕）　　別矣巴黎　（曼琪）　　浮云掩月　（莉莉）　　塞外村女（陳筠）　　航空救國　（儷影）　　風雨歸舟　（莉莉）　　上海歌劇社　　華興（一二六〇）下午六時半至八時　　（一）月上柳梢頭　（二）開始的吻　　（三）梅娘曲　（四）愛情如玫瑰　　（五）路柳牆花　（六）醉臥沙塲　　（七）戀愛明星　（八）英雄夫婿　　（九）船夫曲　（十）紅顏軍士　　（十一）吿別南洋　（十二）紅豆新詩　　（十三）人面桃花　（十四）去年的我　　爵士歌劇社　　華興（一二六〇）九時五分至九時五十分　　我怎能不愛你　（姚莉）　　風雨琴歌　（姚英）　　慰勞歌　（露茜）　　我要你的一切　（張俊）　　新夜來香　（姚莉）　　勇士凱歌　（姚英）　　夜深深　（露茜）　　風雨歸舟　（張俊）　　我怎能不愛你歌詞　　你具有窈窕身體。十足的孩子氣。聰明活潑美麗。無人可比。我怎能不愛你。你具有威武身體。十足的英雄氣。莊嚴偉大强健。無人可比。我怎能不愛你。你溫柔恬靜。十分和氣。我怎能不愛你。你愛國愛家。更愛自己。我怎能不愛你。從小就兩心相依。到現在情更蜜。我們濃情蜜意。無人可比。我怎能不愛你。美術　　毛執中美術講習座　　元昌（一一二〇）上午六時至六時半　　（一）中國美術家故事傳記。　　（二）授無綫電敎中西書講義。電影「永遠的微笑」主角胡蝶之什　　「永遠的微笑」之開拍是遠在胡蝶的另一作品「女權」之前，此片完成的日期據導演者吳村氏的表示，已是不出近一星期了，所以。最近的明星總廠攝影塲是加倍見得工作緊張的進行着「永遠的微笑」，前天在攝一富麗堂皇之南京歌塲的羣芳會唱，台下三百多臨時演員所飾之看客的熱狂的歡四鼓掌中，胡蝶在台上演出着一個歌女的淸唱，時時背臉去，時時笑得甜甜地，大家都覺胡所唱的那一曲「玉堂春」是非常出色的，表演也極其精采！　　胡蝶對於演出「永遠的微笑」是有着非常熱切約期望的，對於劇中的這個女她是了解得頗透澈的，她說在她心底是有着極其美麗的這個歌女的型物，她希望能够在她仔細而熱切的努力中演出得正如她所想像那樣！此外，胡蝶的工作精神是非常値得一提的，她永遠是興奮，是快樂，是和氣地對付一切，不肯疏忽時刻，不肯輕易因事而妨礙工作，在南京攝取外景時候她曾從馬背土摔了下來，擦破了手掌，但她小以爲意，勇敢地復騎上了馬背。不容忽視　趙丹與黎明暉　　對于社會生活經騐的豐富，有天才，肯努力，這是决定了黎明暉在銀幕上的成功，在一般的女明星中能够演多方面的角色，是非常的稀，黎明暉就是這稀少中的一們了。　　當歐陽予倩决定導演「淸明時節」的戲，對于選擇春蘭這一個丫頭的主角，曾考慮了很多决才决定由黎明暉來祖任的，現在「淸明時節」完成，黎明暉是把春蘭的性格盡情的表達了出來，這就是說，黎明暉是成功了。　　同樣的，男明星中能够演多方面角色的也不少，那嶄露頭角顯赫一時的趙丹，可以說與黎明暉是遙遙相對的兩個，「淸明時節」男主角有才角色，亦是經過歐陽予倩多决的思索而决定趙丹的。　　兩個最會做戲的明星分飾了男女主角在一個片中出現，他們那種神化的表情，眞是旗鼓相當，「淸明時節」該是不容你忽視的了。「小孤女」完成　　新華公司繼「狂歡之夜」後又一部精湛的作品，楊小仲編導的哀感頑艷纏綿徘惻鉅片「小孤女」，幾個月來在全體工作人員的同心協力之下，已經於昨日宣佈功德圓滿。這片子以小明星陳奶娟獨擋一面演出，在國產影壇，又是別開生面，預料公映時由於這個小孩子天眞爛漫的表演，一定有一番　動。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Bandit Army Attacks Eastern Suiyuan, Fighting is Fierce; Li Shou-hsin's Bandit Troops Re-attacked at Dawn Yesterday; Our Army's Morale is High, Enemy Aircraft Ineffective; It is Reported That Fu Tso-yi is Commanding in the Pingdiquan Area <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Guihua) At 10 PM on the 15th, bandits attacked Hongge'ertu and were decisively repelled. On the morning of the 16th, bandits launched another dawn attack with intense artillery fire. Our army's positions were solid, and the bandits did not succeed. Subsequently, our army leaped out of the trenches to pursue and kill the bandits, resulting in numerous bandit corpses outside the trenches. Our army's morale soared, while the bandits, having suffered heavy losses for several days, were extremely exhausted. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Li Shou-hsin commanded bandit-puppet troops, attacking Suiyuan from Shangdu. On the 15th, there were over ten minor and major engagements, all repelled by the Suiyuan army. They continued to attack on the evening of the 16th, with the sounds of gunfire and artillery heard within Shangdu city. One faction, fearing a repeat of Wang Ying's and Su Mei-long's defection, decided to use their official and puppet state troops to supervise the battle from the rear. Furthermore, Jin Jia-san's troops are currently advancing to the border of Taolin, with all of them assigned to the main attack on Taolin. Zhang Hai-peng's 2,000 troops stationed in Duolun are scheduled to arrive in Shangdu before the 17th. Zhang's troops have over twenty cannons and sixty machine guns. The puppet state's army and a certain army have been deploying in large numbers from Duolun and Weichang towards Jiaxiasi and Shangdu for days. Moreover, the bandit army recently threw bombs in Hongge'ertu as a show of force. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) There were no new developments at the Taolin front on the 16th. The bandits' actions seem undecided. The current calm is like the eve of a great storm. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Jining reports that after Fu Tso-yi arrived here, he immediately held secret meetings with Zhao Cheng-shou, Da Mi, Ling Su-long, and Ji to discuss thorough defense measures. After suffering setbacks, the bandits plan to switch to guerrilla tactics. Enemy aircraft continue to arrive in the Shangdu area. Moreover, the enemy aircraft are all painted with the insignia of the puppet Manchurian state, as one faction is still trying to avoid direct participation in the war. However, the pilots and machine gunners are all from a certain country. Hongge'ertu is a vital town in Mongolia and Suiyuan, with thriving markets. After the bandit attack on the 15th, shops closed early, creating a desolate atmosphere. The difficulty currently felt by our army is the inconvenience of supplying provisions. Soldiers in the front trenches are eating cold rations and lack winter clothing. All sectors in Jining are making efforts to raise funds for winter gear to be transported to the front. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Fu Tso-yi telegraphed Yan, reporting that according to a telegram from Cavalry Commander Peng, seven enemy aircraft bombed Hongge'ertu at noon on the 15th, dropping dozens of bombs. Enemy artillery simultaneously bombarded the area, and several thousand infantry bandits took the opportunity to attack. They are still in a standoff. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today, according to reliable sources here, the Mongolian and "Manchurian" troops invading eastern Suiyuan have abandoned their positions in the Xinghe area after two days of fighting and are retreating towards Chahar territory. It is said that the invading Mongolian and "Manchurian" troops repeatedly attacked Chinese army lines yesterday but were all repelled. They attacked again this morning, and although they had aircraft, tanks, and armored vehicles for support, they were ultimately dispersed by the Chinese army. It is estimated that the enemy aircraft dropped no fewer than a hundred bombs on Chinese positions over the past two days. Suiyuan Province Chairman Fu Tso-yi is currently directing military operations in Pingdiquan. Since the outbreak of hostilities, it seems that the Chinese defense forces have repeatedly achieved victories.

The company's preparatory office was originally located in the Higuchi residence of the North China Japanese Army Aviation Department on Asahi Street in the Japanese Concession. Recently, Higuchi was transferred to head the Huitong Aviation Group, and his residence was changed to the company's office branch. At the same time, the military department also abolished the aviation department organization and merged it into Huitong Company. Zhang Yunrong said that Sino-Japanese air service is conducted according to the principle of equality and mutual benefit. In the past, the Japanese military department had established its own aviation department and informally opened up air routes outside the pass for a long time. The establishment of Huitong Company is to prevent the indiscriminate use of Japanese military aircraft entering our airspace and to make North China aviation operate under a regulated manner, with mutual trust. Eight aircraft will be transported from the Northeast in the next few days, but the official opening of air service has not been scheduled due to procedural matters. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) With Li Tonghua returning south and Ansier not coming north, the work of the Road Transport Anti-Smuggling Inspection Office has come to a standstill. Whether it will be relocated, the office has not yet received news. Eastern Hebei is taking this opportunity to transport large amounts of smuggled goods to Tianjin every day. Each batch consists of over one hundred and fifty heavy-duty trucks, all transported by road, passing through various places as if entering a land without governance. Because the winter freeze makes it difficult to import goods by river, various unscrupulous merchants are buying in bulk, causing the price of smuggled goods to rise. The Seisho and Chosen Banks have specifically extended loans to support the smugglers, totaling more than five million yuan. Therefore, Eastern Hebei District Japanese banknotes are already circulating directly in the market. According to the statistics of the pseudo-Eastern Hebei government, from January to the end of October this year, smuggled goods transported to Tianjin via the Beining Railway have evaded regular customs duties of around 44 million, with artificial silk saving taxes of 9,485,000 yuan and cotton cloth saving 14,896,000 yuan being the most.

<p>(Fengtian) The American Catholic priest, Father Burns, who was kidnapped by bandits, had been held captive for nearly ten and a half months, and was imprisoned in the high mountains of southeastern Manchuria, which were almost uninhabited. It is now reported that he has escaped danger and will arrive in Dunhua, east of Fengtian, tomorrow. It is said that the news of Burns' escape was confirmed after the American Consulate General in Fengtian received a phone call today. It is also known that Mr. Wu, a Chinese teacher who was captured at the same time as Burns, also escaped. According to a report received by the Japanese military police here, Burns and others escaped by taking advantage of a military advance. After Burns was kidnapped, the bandits demanded 5 million yuan in cash and various new-style guns as ransom. Mr. Davis, the American Vice Consul here, is scheduled to go to Dunhua tomorrow to meet Burns. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e66">The Significance of Germany Abolishing Free Navigation Clauses <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>The Treaty of Versailles has finally become a "dead letter." In recent years, every move in German diplomacy has been enough to affect France, the midwife of "Versailles," the League of Nations, the offspring of "Versailles," Czechoslovakia, another byproduct of Versailles, and the Soviet Union, which has a deep relationship with all three. Recently, the German government notified the governments of fourteen countries, announcing the abolition of the clauses stipulated in Part XII of the Treaty of Versailles regarding the international free navigation of rivers within Germany, such as the Rhine, Oder, Elbe, Niemen, Danube, and Kiel Canal. We can also observe the impact of this move from the above-mentioned aspects. Of course, Germany had long ago made up its mind to completely tear up the Treaty of Versailles. In 1932, the year before the Nazi Party came to power, we saw at the Lausanne Conference the Germans abolish the reparations that the current Minister of Economy, Hjalmar Schacht, considered "draining the blood of the German people." In 1933, Germany demanded equal status and withdrew from the League of Nations. In 1935, Germany abolished the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles in order to expand its military. In 1936, Germany abolished the Locarno Security Pact while arming the Rhineland. The current abolition of international free navigation on rivers within Germany is a consistent tactic of the Nazi Party, and in terms of foreign policy, it is a response to other fascist countries and an expression of opposition to the European peace front. Since the establishment of the German-Austrian Agreement in July, the two European fascist countries have not been as critical of each other as they were in the past two years due to the struggle for hegemony over Austria. Recently, Foreign Minister Ciano visited Berlin. As a result, not only did the two countries bury the hatchet, but they also established many secret agreements in political and economic terms. That is, with regard to Austria, they reached an understanding; with regard to the Danube River economic issues, they divided spheres of influence; with regard to the future Locarno Conference, they adopted unified action, contacted Britain to put pressure on France, weakened the forces of the peace front, and created an anti-Soviet war fund. Since Germany and Italy already have close ties, Germany naturally wants to respond in unison to Italy's diplomatic actions. The result of the tripartite meeting between Italy, Austria, and Hungary on the 12th of this month was that the protocol recognized that Austria and Hungary have the right to demand equal rights to armaments. This is no less than another serious blow to the Treaty of Versailles. Germany, having a tacit understanding in advance, must also have an expression later. The abolition of the clauses on international free navigation has become a timely embellishment.</p>
<p>After Germany abolishes the clauses on international free navigation, the countries most affected will of course be Switzerland and Czechoslovakia, because both of these countries are landlocked and must pass through international rivers to reach the sea. According to Part XII of the Treaty of Versailles, several international committees were established to manage the Rhine, Oder, Elbe, Niemen, and Danube Rivers. The purpose was to provide convenience to these countries. Now that Germany has unilaterally abolished the international navigation clauses, Czechoslovakia will have no way to utilize the international waterways of the Elbe and Danube Rivers, and will also have no way to access the free ports of Hamburg and Stettin within Germany. In this sense, Czechoslovakia has indeed suffered a not small blow. From another perspective, giving Czechoslovakia a direct blow is also giving France an indirect demonstration, because among the Little Entente countries, Czechoslovakia is France's most loyal ally and the closest friend of the Soviet Union. Germany wants to expand its power in Central Europe, promote its eastward development policy, and unite the European Germanic nations into a great Germanic empire. All of them need to strike at the "thorn in the eye" of Central Europe. Moreover, in today's rising anti-peace movement in Central Europe, cunning Nazis also need an excuse to lift the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles from the Germanic nation in order to divert the attention of the hungry masses at home.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Spanish Rebel Army Launches a Full-Scale Attack on Madrid; Aerial Bombardment and Cannon Fire Resound Ceaselessly; the Besieged City's Garrison Repulsed in Three Counterattacks <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Spanish Nationalist army is currently bombarding the gates of Madrid. According to the latest news from the Nationalist army, they have found a weakness in the defensive lines laid by the government forces, which they had been seeking for days. As for the bridges that were blown up in the area where the Nationalist army crossed the river, it did not actually hinder their advance, because the Manzanares River is extremely shallow, only about two feet deep, and the troops can simply wade across the river. The Nationalist army's advance from the north not only allows them to attack the western defensive lines of the government forces from the rear, but also provides a flat road for tanks and other vehicles to drive straight into Madrid.</p>
<p>It is reported that the headquarters of Nationalist army commander General Varela has moved to the Cuatro Vientos airfield, only about four miles from the center of Madrid. Before the Nationalist army attacked, they first opened fire with heavy artillery, and at the same time, several of their bombers dropped more than fifty tons of bombs on the government forces, causing fires in many places with flames soaring. A Reuters reporter in the Nationalist army reported in a telegram that the fighting was extremely fierce and the sound of machine guns never stopped for even half an hour. The government forces' artillery positions in Madrid opened fire with heavy artillery, and the Nationalist army returned fire in kind. Moorish soldiers and legionnaires charged with bayonets and captured a ridge held by the government forces.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters correspondent in the Nationalist army, eight Nationalist bombers, led by twenty-four fighters, dropped one ton of bombs near the University City of Madrid and Casa de Campo, causing a violent bombardment. The government forces were forced to abandon their original defense positions. After the heavy bombardment, the area was filled with smoke that lingered for a long time. Three government planes participated in the battle and were very brave, flying very low over the Nationalist army's positions and strafing the enemy with machine guns. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Avila. Spanish rebel forces launched a full-scale attack on Madrid's western gate this morning, intending to enter the capital city from the Montaña barracks and the Modelo prison. The rebel artillery also bombarded that area fiercely on the eve of the attack, with ceaseless cannon fire all night long. Rebel planes dropped multiple bombs on the old Royal Palace, and the university district and French Bridge outside the city were also targeted for bombing. (National Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<p>Madrid. The Defense Committee declared at noon today that rebel forces near Madrid had not crossed the Manzanares River at any point. Moroccan soldiers and legionnaires belonging to the rebel forces, under the cover of nineteen tanks, engaged our forces near the "French" bridge (two kilometers north of Casa de Campo Park) west of the city starting at 3:00 PM yesterday, but after four hours of fierce fighting, they ultimately failed to reach their objective and retreated with heavy losses. Our forces demolished the "French" bridge and destroyed three tanks. The intensity of the fighting was unprecedented since the beginning of the battles near Madrid. This morning, the rebel forces attacked again, but were again repulsed by our forces. In addition, rebel planes flew to the capital yesterday and dropped bombs, killing many civilians. It is said that the rebel forces' native Spanish pilots are unwilling to drop bombs over the capital, so the bombers are German and Italian pilots. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Avila. Our correspondent reports exclusively that the government forces yesterday made another attempt to break through the Nationalist army's lines on the outskirts of Madrid, but failed again. The government forces adopted a feint attack strategy, initially pretending to attack the area of the "Toledo" bridge outside the southern gate, with intense gunfire and artillery fire, but soon unexpectedly launched a surprise attack on the San Isidro Cemetery area in the southwestern suburbs. This area was defended by two columns of legionnaires under the command of Nationalist army Colonels De la Torre and Baron. When the legionnaires saw the enemy forces attacking, they hid behind the hillside and tried their best to resist, and fired machine guns from the side. As a result, the government forces could not withstand it and immediately retreated to their original positions. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Seville. The Nationalist army's radio station in this city recently issued a battle report stating that the government forces' three counterattacks near Madrid yesterday all failed, leaving more than 400 bodies behind. A Frenchman named Blanc was also killed in action. The first counterattack by the government forces was carried out by the so-called "International Brigade," whose members were mostly from Russia and Catalonia, carrying the latest Russian weapons, and attacked the Nationalist army's right flank (south of Madrid), but were defeated and heavily damaged by the Nationalist army. The second counterattack, also in the town of Alcala, was repulsed. The Nationalist army took the opportunity to use tanks to attack the Toledo bridge area, inflicting heavy casualties on the government forces. Finally, the government forces launched counterattacks at the Toledo, Princesa, Segovia bridgeheads, but were forced to retreat after heavy artillery fire from the Nationalist army. The Nationalist army immediately occupied the town of Pozuelo on the outskirts of the city and carried out mopping-up operations in the area already occupied south of Madrid.

<h3 id="e68">Spanish Prime Minister Expresses Determination to Resist, Says Loss of Madrid Unrelated to Overall War Situation <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Valencia. Prime Minister Caballero, having just returned from an inspection of the front lines in Madrid, gave a statement to our reporter saying that the soldiers and civilians of Madrid are determined to fight to the end, and the capital will certainly not fall into the hands of the rebel army. Fascism is deeply hated by the Spanish people, and there is no possibility of success. Even if Madrid falls, the rebel army will only gain a moral victory, which is unrelated to the overall war situation. In short, we are determined to defend every inch of land in our hands with all our strength, until we die in battle. As for the weapons we need, they are now arriving in a steady stream, so it would not be wrong to say that the war has only just begun. In addition, the people of the whole country are against the rebel army, and the final victory will undoubtedly belong to us. Our reporter then asked if the Spanish government planned to recapture the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean, which had been occupied by the Nationalist army and where the Italians had built strong defensive fortifications. The Prime Minister replied, "The Spanish government will never give up its legitimate territory. The war will continue until all the territory before the civil strife has been restored."

<h3 id="e69">Rebel Air Raids Over Madrid Three Times a Day; Nearly One Hundred Dead, Three Hundred Wounded <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Madrid. After bombing Madrid this morning, Nationalist army planes flew over again around 3:00 PM for a second attack, dropping bombs. The sky was clear and boundless. From the ground, it was clear that there were two squadrons of Nationalist bombers, protected by fighters, flying quite high. The bombs they dropped were the same as this morning, mostly falling in the densely populated "Quadrilateral District." It was Sunday afternoon, and many residents were walking and sunbathing along the Pablo Iglesias Avenue in that area. They were suddenly attacked by enemy planes dropping bombs and could not escape to the basement in time. As a result, ten people were killed and about one hundred were wounded. They were immediately carried into ambulances and private cars and transported to be buried or to various hospitals for treatment. The doctors in the hospitals were insufficient, so private doctors were temporarily invited to help. In total, in the last 24 hours, 80 to 100 people have died due to Nationalist army air raids, and 300 have been wounded, many of whom may die from their injuries or have become disabled. It is also reported that during this morning's Nationalist army air raid, a bomb destroyed the roof of the Faculty of Law. In addition, the Nationalist army used heavy artillery to bombard various districts of Madrid, relentlessly throughout the day. In the afternoon, the Plaza de España and the most modern Gran Vía in the city center were also hit by multiple shells. Although the residents of the city are living in a hail of bullets, their morale is still very high and they are not discouraged at all. After the enemy's repeated air raids, the soldiers and civilians defending the city are even more hostile to the enemy, and their morale is even higher. The government has posted notices all over the streets, calling on the soldiers and civilians to bravely resist and saying that the government forces will soon be able to win and save the people from their suffering. Although the crowds on the streets are under the threat of enemy planes and artillery shells, they seem not to be afraid at all, and there are still many people reading the notices aloud in various places. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Madrid. According to a communiqué issued here today, the Nationalist army launched three air raids on the capital today, killing 17 people and wounding more than 100. The first air raid involved ten bombers and twelve fighters, dropping many bombs. One bomb landed in the Central University, and the rest landed in the North Station and densely populated areas, causing many casualties. Government planes took off to attack, but the enemy planes retreated without a fight. According to reports in today's newspapers, there is fully confirmed news that in the past two weeks, government planes have shot down 100 Nationalist army planes. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>Talavera. According to a Reuters correspondent in the Nationalist army, the two sides are still engaged in fierce fighting along a ten-mile front. The former Royal Private Garden, Casa de Campo, is still the main battlefield for seizing the capital. Last night, 200 militiamen used ropes to climb the walls of the garden and attacked the Nationalist army's sentry posts. It is reported that three Englishmen were among the dead. All 200 were wiped out, but the defending forces also suffered heavy losses. Well-trained soldiers in the militia then attacked the column commanded by Colonel Castelljon, which was holding part of Casa de Campo, but failed due to the lack of artillery support. Further north, the Nationalist army column commanded by Colonel Barón has occupied several houses near the Segovia Bridge. It is believed that the government army machine gunners defending the area have retreated to the Madrid side of the Manzanares River. Fierce fighting continued in various locations south of Madrid throughout yesterday. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Salamanca. The Nationalist army headquarters recently issued a communiqué stating that three columns under the command of General Varela of the Central Army yesterday afternoon crossed the Manzanares River outside Madrid and immediately occupied many of the defensive fortifications built by the government forces. Earlier, our army bravely attacked at dawn yesterday, and the enemy stubbornly resisted, and the war was very fierce. However, the enemy artillery was controlled by our artillery fire, and our infantry, under the cover of tanks and aircraft, rushed through the Casa de Campo Park west of the city. The enemy was facing the river to fight, resisting desperately. Our army was in high morale, and fought the enemy in close combat with bayonets and hand grenades, and finally occupied several of the enemy's defensive fortifications, and captured several tanks. The enemy then collapsed and retreated, and our army was able to advance to the northwestern area of Madrid. By evening, it had occupied the West Park and the Calle de los Rosales (north of the North Station), which was the most important battle yesterday. No major battles occurred on other fronts.

<p>(1) Multiple government aircraft first flew to the Avila airfield (90 kilometers from the capital) west of the capital and saw seven rebel bombers and three fighters parked there, all made in Germany. They immediately bombarded them and then flew to the Dorioux and Toledo airfields in the south to carry out bombardments. (2) The Talavera railway station, 100 kilometers southwest of the capital, is a key strategic location. Government aircraft also bombarded it. (3) The area near the Casa de Campo Park in the western suburbs is where a large number of rebel forces are concentrated. Fourteen government aircraft flew there yesterday to bombard it, flying very low. Several rebel aircraft took off to fight back. As a result, two rebel aircraft, made in Germany, were shot down. In total, yesterday's bombardments destroyed four rebel aircraft and damaged twenty. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) In view of Madrid's failure to fall and the widespread rumors that multiple batches of military supplies from Soviet Russia have been transported to Spain, the German side is likely to make renewed efforts to effectively manage the transport of military supplies to Spain. German newspapers are blaming General Franco's negligence for the continued arrival of Soviet military supplies in Spain. A Berlin newspaper today carried a report from the Black Sea port of Constanta, saying that several batches of elite Soviet troops boarded armored auxiliary cruisers on Friday and set sail from Odessa for Spain. At present, German people believe that Hitler's remarks to the army and other leaders a few days ago have nothing to do with the Spanish question. It is said that what Herr Hitler discussed was all trivial matters of an ordinary nature. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>(Rome) Well-informed sources recently announced that when the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party meets in the coming days, it will pass a resolution to grant King Vittorio Emanuele III the title of "Emperor of Italy" and hold a coronation ceremony, rather than using the title "King of Italy and Emperor of Abyssinia." Since Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, most countries have refused to recognize it. Therefore, whenever ambassadors to Italy are replaced, various diplomatic difficulties arise due to the issue of titles in the letters of credence. As a result, the position of ambassador to Italy from some countries remains vacant. This is what the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party is doing to resolve the above-mentioned difficulties.

<p>(Tokyo) After the Japanese Navy received the news that the United States was building an air force base on Midway Island and was further planning to build an air force base on Wake Island, close to the Japanese-mandated South Pacific islands, with an investment of millions, all parties were greatly stimulated. The Navy authorities believe that the United States is implementing the above plan when the treaty expires. If these two bases are established, Japan will be directly threatened. Midway is 1,000 nautical miles away, and Wake Island is only 1,200 nautical miles from Tokyo. The island is the first line of the US Air Force's attack on East Asia, advancing more than 1,000 nautical miles from Hawaii. Moreover, Wake Island is only two or three hundred nautical miles away from our mandated South Pacific islands, which is a problem that the Japanese Navy must pay attention to.

<h3 id="e84">Roosevelt's Cruise to the Philippines: Only Possible in the Autumn of Next Year; Philippine Finances Show Surplus <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Observers familiar with island affairs believe today that after President Roosevelt attends the peace conference in South America, his decision for a long-distance cruise, possibly to the Philippines, may have to wait until the autumn of next year. Currently, this plan is still in the preliminary stage. However, when the President was fishing, he told the son of the Philippine representative to the United States, Mr. Barretes, that he hoped to try fishing in the Philippines. This remark is particularly noteworthy. It is said that the tentative plan is for the President to travel to Manila by cruise ship, departing from Seattle, only stopping in U.S. territories along the way. As for the motive for the cruise to the Philippines, it is purely the President's personal interest. (15th National News)</p>
<p>Manila The Philippine Autonomous Government's Finance Minister, Mr. Alas, told the Associated Press today that the Philippine financial situation is very stable. Since the establishment of the government a year ago, the national treasury has had a surplus of over one million yuan. Therefore, there is no concern of a deficit in the next two years.

<p>(London) Regarding the Anglo-Italian agreement on the Mediterranean issue, Foreign Secretary Eden, in his meeting with Italian Ambassador Grandi last Friday, conveyed the British government's views.

<p>(Paris) After the German government announced the abrogation of the clauses in the Treaty of Versailles that allowed ships from European and American countries to freely navigate certain German rivers, the French government intends to propose to the relevant countries a joint protest. Foreign Minister Delbos returned to Paris from Bericourt this morning to preside over these negotiations. Responsible sources revealed that the Czech Republic and Belgium may accept the above proposal. However, it is not yet known whether the action will be a joint one or separate protests from each country. (15th Havas)</p>
<p>(London) The French Ambassador, Mr. Corbin, went to the British Foreign Office this morning, representing the French government, to propose to Foreign Secretary Eden that the countries concerned jointly protest to Germany. It is generally believed that although the British government doubts the effectiveness of this method, it will still accept France's proposal. (16th Havas)</p>
<p>Brussels After the German government announced the abrogation of the clauses in the Treaty of Versailles that allowed ships from European and American countries to freely navigate certain German rivers, the Belgian government reportedly still hopes that Germany can provide a legal explanation. For example, whether the Rhine River navigation regulations established in Mönchengladbach, Germany, in May of this year are still valid. Responsible sources stated that the Belgian government will not take any initiative but will wait for feedback from Britain and France. Economic circles say that Belgian ships traveling between Antwerp and the Rhine River total 800,000 tons, and they do not expect to suffer any losses as a result. (16th Havas)</p>
<p>Frankfurt, Germany After the government announced the abrogation of the clauses in the Treaty of Versailles regarding the free navigation of certain German rivers by ships from European and American countries, the "Frankfurter Zeitung" recently stated that the German government is now prepared to conduct bilateral negotiations with various countries regarding river navigation matters in the hope of agreeing on new measures. (16th Havas)</p>
<p>Vienna After the German government unilaterally abrogated the clauses regarding free navigation on domestic rivers, officials here declared that this action does not affect German-Austrian relations. Although the German representative has officially withdrawn from the Danube International Navigation Commission, according to the commission's rules of procedure, a meeting can be held with the attendance of eight representatives. Therefore, excluding the German representative, there are still nine countries that can attend, which exceeds the "legal quorum." The meeting will be held in Vienna on December 3 as scheduled, and the Danube International Navigation issue can be resolved. (16th Havas)</p>

(Note: The Port of Fiume is located on the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea. Before World War I, it belonged to Hungary. After World War I, both Italy and Yugoslavia wanted to claim it.

<h3 id="e94">Bandit Disturbances in Eastern Suiyuan: Movements of Japanese Troops in North China; Advocate Suspending Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Negotiations; Treat the Suiyuan Incident as a Separate Issue <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Hashimoto, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army in Tianjin, Staff Officer Wachi, Attaché Tsukada, Aide-de-Camp Kawada, etc., returned to Tianjin on the 12th after visiting Han Fuju in Jinan. At 9:00 a.m. on the 13th, the Japanese Army Command held a special meeting, presided over by Commander Tasiro. All command staff, including Iida, Adachi, Tsuii, and Kai, as well as attaché Suzuki, Nagamine, and Sinagawa, attended. Mori Singichi, an attaché sent by the Kwantung Army Command, also attended the meeting and offered suggestions. Hashimoto and Wachi first reported on their inspection of Shandong and their meetings with Han Fuju and Shen Honglie. Then they began to discuss the situation in North China, economic development, and the issue of eastern Suiyuan. Finally, they decided on a reply to Tokyo's inquiry about Sino-Japanese diplomatic opinions. The meeting adjourned at 12:00. Mori Singichi left for Guanwai (Manchuria) on the night train of the 14th to report. In addition to specific policies on the economic development of eastern Suiyuan and Sino-Japanese diplomacy, the Japanese Army Command in Tianjin learned that during Staff Officer Ikeda's return to Japan to negotiate with various financial groups, the financial groups expressed their unwillingness to be controlled by the China Development Company, as it would limit their operations. They would only invest in the direction indicated by the Japanese Army Command if the China Development Company canceled the proposal to enhance its organization. Therefore, Tasiro deeply felt that this matter was clearly in opposition to the South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu) and that to make the China Development Company automatically abandon its plan to increase capital, it would be necessary to cooperate with the Kwantung Army Command. Therefore, he sent Chief of Staff Nagata to Changchun to meet with Itagaki to discuss the matter. Nagata telegraphed his reply to Tianjin on the 14th and will return on the 17th. At that time, the Japanese Army Command in Tianjin will hold another meeting to discuss and make a final decision. However, Mantetsu sent Director Sakatani Tsunekawa to Tianjin on the 13th to reside there, replacing the deceased Director Ishimoto, to assist the China Development Company in developing mineral resources. This again caused a head-on conflict with the Tianjin Japanese Army Command's intention to restrict the expansion of the China Development Company. It is still unknown how the Japanese Army Command will deal with it.</p>
<p>Regarding Sino-Japanese diplomacy, the Japanese central leadership, seeing that Kawagoe's meetings with our Foreign Minister Zhang have repeatedly failed to yield any hope of progress, fears that prolonged negotiations will damage the country's prestige. Therefore, they telegraphed the heads of the army, navy, and foreign affairs agencies in North China to solicit their opinions and subtly hinted at the possibility of immediately terminating the negotiations. On the morning of the 12th, Hashimoto and Wachi returned from Jinan and reported to Tasiro, who then exchanged opinions with the Japanese Consul General in Tianjin, Horiuchi, and the Chief of the Naval Intelligence Agency, Kubota. They agreed to terminate the negotiations, retain all pending cases, and wait for an opportunity to negotiate again. Therefore, according to the news circulating here, it can be determined that Kawagoe's meeting with Foreign Minister Zhang will, at most, go through one more time before they conclude this round of diplomacy. Tianjin also rumors that Kawagoe will return to Japan before the 25th of this month to report on the negotiation process. After this, Japan will continue to pursue its long-standing policy in North China, treating the Hebei-Chahar Political Council as its counterpart and entrusting the Japanese Army Command in Tianjin to handle matters directly at any time. This is because they want to achieve results quickly and no longer want to take a circuitous diplomatic route.</p>
<p>The Japanese Army Command in Tianjin still adheres to its principle of viewing the Suiyuan incident as a separate matter and makes no expression. All military actions on that side are entirely planned by the Kwantung Army Command. Although there have recently been battles in eastern Suiyuan, the territory of Hebei-Chahar remains as peaceful as ever. This is what the Japanese Army Command in Tianjin means by "treating it as a separate matter." (14th)</p>

<p>Shangdu Correspondence: Li Shouxin, commander of the puppet army, is supervising the bandit-puppet forces to attack Suiyuan. The battle situation is quite fierce. By the afternoon of the 12th, it had eased slightly. It is heard that the puppet bandits' plan to attack Suiyuan has been decided: after a large army of a certain party and the newly trained elite from Jehol arrive at Bailingmiao, they will launch a general offensive on all fronts of Suiyuan around the 20th of this month, with a focus on the western Suiyuan route. Because Wang Ying's bandit troops are extremely familiar with the geography of western Suiyuan, Wang Ying's bandit troops will invade Wuchuan and Guyang, directly entering the Hetao region, while other routes will take a mobile disruption strategy to check the Suiyuan army's forces. Recently, Bailingmiao and Shangdu have become the military center of the bandit-puppet forces. The bandit-puppet troops gathered in Bailingmiao have reached more than 20,000. The firearms of Wang Ying's bandit troops in Shangdu have all been replaced with new guns and sent to Bailingmiao. The infantry of Zhang Wanqing's brigade can also be fully replaced after the 15th. A certain party is currently recruiting a large number of workers in Shangdu to build aircraft hangars and gasoline storage depots. The cement and other materials for construction have now been transported and will be started immediately. It is also planned to build similar warehouses in Bailingmiao, which are also being designed. (13th)</p>
<h3 id="e96">Truth About Wang Jun's Fatal Plane Crash: Cause of Accident Was Due to Damaged Aircraft Parts; 3rd Army Temporarily Headed by Zeng Wanzhong as Acting Army Commander <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Lanzhou Correspondence: Wang Jun, commander of the 3rd Army of the Army, took a military plane from Tianshui on the 9th of this month to Lanzhou to request instructions, intending to go to the front to supervise the suppression. Unexpectedly, when the plane flew to Langshitang, more than ten miles southeast of Maying in Tongwei, the aircraft parts suddenly broke, and it crashed and caught fire. Army Commander Wang and pilot Li Tuxian both suffered unexpected misfortunes. When the news spread, everyone was extremely shocked and mourned. Lanzhou received this bad news on the evening of the same day. Because the troops of the 3rd Army were suppressing bandits at the front, fearing that it would affect the morale of the army, it was not published until today. The details are supplemented as follows:</p>
<p>Coming to Lanzhou to Request Instructions</p>
<p>Because the troops of the 7th Division under Wang's command had arrived north of Jingyuan and Hui Ning from southern Longnan in the pursuit of the remaining bandits, and were about to continue pursuing the bandits on the Gansu-Ningxia border, Zhu Shaoliang, director of the Pacification Headquarters, telegraphed Wang to come to Lanzhou to discuss the strategy of suppressing the bandits. Upon receiving the telegram, Wang sent Chief of Staff Zhou Tiren to fly to Lanzhou on the No. 405 Douglas military plane on the 8th. The plane then flew back to Tianshui on the same day. Wang then took off from Tianshui at 9:05 a.m. on the 9th to come to Lanzhou. Only pilot Li Tuxian was on the same plane. Unexpectedly, at about 9:45 a.m., when they flew to Langshitang, more than ten miles southeast of Maying in Tongwei, the aircraft parts suddenly broke down, and the plane crashed and caught fire. Wang and the pilot were too seriously injured and died before they could be rescued.</p>
<p>After the Plane Crash</p>
<p>After this unexpected misfortune occurred, the Pacification Headquarters received telegrams from Wang, commander of the division in Tongwei, reporting the plane crash on the evening of the same day and the morning of the 10th. They immediately sent Deputy Adjutant Li Yuhua and Zhou Tiren, chief of staff of the 3rd Army, to the scene of the accident by car to collect the remains of Wang and the pilot.</p>
<p>Inspection of the Plane Crash</p>
<p>After Li and Zhou arrived at Langshitang, they immediately inspected the crashed plane. The fuselage had been completely burned, and the frame was also broken. The remains of Wang and the pilot were all trapped in the wreckage. Their bodies were charred by the fire, their limbs were broken, and their faces were blurred and difficult to identify. The situation was extremely tragic. Wang's personal military map, an antique box, and a shotgun that he carried with him, although partially burned, were still in the plane as his last relics. However, the pilot's eagle badge was still intact.</p>
<p>Moving the Coffin Back to Qin</p>
<p>Wang's remains were hastily placed in a coffin on the evening of the 10th. On the 11th, they were transported to Maying, where the local garrison officials and people from all walks of life held a temporary public memorial service in front of the coffin. On the 12th, the coffin was transported back to Qin by car. On the 13th, it was re-coffined, and his military personnel and relatives and family members handled the funeral affairs. After a public memorial service is held on a scheduled date, it will be transported back to its original home in Yunnan for burial.</p>
<p>Cause of the Accident</p>
<p>The pilot Li Tuxian, who was piloting the No. 405 military plane to Lanzhou this time, was from Liling, Hunan, and was 26 years old. He was a member of the Air Force's 4th Team and graduated from the Hunan Aviation Office and the Nanchang Air Force Training Corps. His piloting skills were originally very pure and he had never had an accident. He was always praised by his superiors. It is speculated that the cause of this accident was not poor piloting skills, and the weather between Lanzhou and Qin was sunny and windless on that day, so it can be judged that the aircraft parts suddenly broke down during the flight, the operation stopped or there was an oil leak and fire, leading to an unexpected misfortune that was unavoidable.</p>
<p>Shock and Mourning from All Sides</p>
<p>Lanzhou, Tianshui, Xi'an, Shanghai, and other places were shocked and mourned upon receiving this bad news. Wang's subordinates were deeply saddened. In addition to reporting to Chairman Chiang and the Xi'an Headquarters by telegram, Pacification Headquarters Director Zhu Shaoliang personally went to Tianshui on the morning of the 11th by a Boeing plane sent by Deputy Commander Zhang to comfort Wang's subordinates and his family. He is still in Qin and has not returned.</p>
<p>Army Commander's Position</p>
<p>The troops under Wang's command are the 7th and 12th Divisions. The commander of the 7th Division is Zeng Wanzhong, and the commander of the 12th Division is Tang Huaiyuan. They have been stationed in the Longnan area for the past two years and have been quite harmonious with the military and civilians. Recently, they have achieved remarkable results in suppressing bandits. After receiving the report of Wang's plane crash, Chairman Chiang ordered Zeng Wanzhong, the commander of the 7th Division of the army, to temporarily act as army commander, as the army was ordered to suppress bandits and the army commander's position could not be vacant for long.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Banking Sector Plans to Invest in Huai River Water Conservancy Project - Inter-Provincial Remittance Conference to be Held in Zhenjiang - <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Wancheng (Anhui Province) is located in the Yangtze and Huai River basins and has always been known for its abundant agricultural products. However, in recent years, it has suffered from droughts and floods, resulting in incalculable losses. The provincial authorities, in an effort to remedy this situation, have launched large-scale water conservancy projects throughout the province for the past two years (24th and 25th years of the Republic), aiming to prevent both droughts and floods. This spring, after the official establishment of the local bank, it has invested in and assisted in the completion of various riverfront water conservancy projects. It is also preparing to devote its economic resources to the construction and development of the Huai River area. Recently, after discussions between the bank and the provincial authorities, it was decided to implement the following projects: (1) Huai River Water Conservancy and Land Reclamation: In the Huai River region of northern Anhui, there are over 100,000 mu of fertile滩land suitable for mechanized agriculture, cultivating wheat and other grains. After repeated consultations between the Department of Finance and Construction and the local bank, it was decided that the local bank and other banks would invest over ten million yuan to engage in water conservancy projects and gradually reclaim the land. (2) Handling Simple Agricultural Product Mortgages: In recent years, various banks have been enthusiastically investing in rural areas, mainly through cooperatives and warehouse mortgages. However, many farmers still find it inconvenient. To regulate the rural economy and provide in-depth services to rural areas, the bank has decided to pilot simple mortgage loans. Under this method, farmers can mortgage rice and grains and store them in their own homes without having to transport them to a warehouse. However, they must obtain certification from the local保甲chief to receive the loan. The loan amount will be initially limited to five shi of rice and ten shi of paddy. The amount will be adjusted based on the implementation. (3) On Coordinating Local Finance Among Provinces: Local banks or provincial banks in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi provinces have all expressed their agreement. Cheng Zhenji, the head of the Anhui local bank, has been instructed to write to Zhao Dihua, the director of the Jiangsu Department of Finance and the head of the Jiangsu Farmers Bank, to propose a conference in Zhenjiang to discuss inter-provincial remittance and the exchange of subsidiary coins. If effective methods are confirmed and implemented in the future, they will be extended to the provinces in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and eventually throughout the country.

<p>Beiping Correspondence: Li Daming of the Overseas Chinese News arrived in Beiping from Tianjin yesterday and visited Song, the chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, and Qin, the mayor of Beiping. On the 13th, he hosted a reception for local news reporters at the Lai Jin Yu Xuan in Zhongshan Park. In his speech, he stated that the motivation for his investigation was the recent tense situation in North China and the proliferation of rumors. Overseas Chinese, far from their homeland, could not discern the truth. Our country has never paid attention to communications. When the situation changes slightly, the other side engages in propaganda at will. Therefore, it is not easy to understand the actual situation without a personal visit. Moreover, in the 9/18 and 1/28 incidents, overseas Chinese spontaneously donated large sums of money. However, at that time, they did not understand the remittance methods or entrusted the funds to the wrong people, resulting in many errors. Therefore, he had to come to the north to inquire to avoid similar incidents in the future. Mr. Li also said that overseas Chinese should not succumb to political demands, uphold independent diplomacy, liberate the people internally, restore their inherent rights and freedoms, and gather talent so that the people and the government can cooperate in all directions and use the power of 400 million people to cope with the national crisis. Mr. Li concluded by saying that North China is unfortunately the frontline of national defense today. He hopes that the people will not shy away from difficulties but will strengthen their forces and go to the front line together to support this precarious situation. Overseas Chinese will never sit idly by and watch the country perish, nor will they sit idly by and watch the saving generals and the people of the frontline struggling without assistance. It is said that Mr. Li will stay in Beiping for a week before going to Shanxi and Suiyuan for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Fuzhou Unscrupulous Merchants Ship Rice to Taiwan - Rice Prices Rise Accordingly - Great Impact on People's Food Supply <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The early rice crops in the coastal counties of this province suffered from several floods between spring and summer. Low-lying areas were inundated, and replanting was impossible, so the rice roots were removed to plant late rice. Fortunately, the weather and rainfall have been suitable. Last month, when the rice flowers bloomed, the weather was sunny and rainy, which was conducive to farming. After the crops matured, the weather was sunny, making it easier for the grains to solidify. According to people familiar with agriculture, the late rice crop is expected to be abundant. Farmers in various villages, as the autumn harvest is approaching, are selling off their stored grain, causing rice prices to fall by more than five jiao per shi. Rice is sold on the market for only nine yuan and three or four jiao per shi, while決rice is sold for only eight yuan and seven or eight jiao. Rice merchants believe that Fuzhou rice prices are two yuan lower than Shanghai rice prices and three yuan lower than Taiwan rice prices, so they are purchasing and transporting rice to Shanghai and Taiwan for sale. Except for rice transported to Shanghai, which is formally declared for export, the rice transported along the coast is loaded onto sailing ships and transported to Taiwan, which is more profitable than shipping to Shanghai. As a result, Fuzhou rice prices have recently risen by more than three or four jiao, which has affected the people's food supply. The Minhou County Party Department yesterday submitted a report to the Provincial Party Department requesting the Provincial Government to strictly prohibit rice exports to protect the national foundation and benefit the people. The report stated that the city's grain supply has always relied on the rice-producing areas of Fuding, Ningde, Lianjiang, and Luoyuan in eastern Fujian to provide assistance to the province, to avoid a shortage of grain between harvests. The city's rice and grain can only be imported, not exported. Now that the early rice crop is on the market, rice prices should fall to benefit the people. However, in recent days, there has been a continued upward trend. It is heard that unscrupulous rice merchants in Fuzhou, Ningde, Luoyuan, and other counties, as well as in the city, disregard the interests of the people and falsely claim to be transporting rice to Quanzhou and Shantou, but in reality, they are secretly transporting rice to Taiwan, where they can earn a profit of two or three yuan per shi of rice. In this time of national crisis, with the situation in East Asia tense, all Chinese people should actively store grain to help the country in case of emergency. However, they are not doing so, but instead damaging their own vitality and moving towards destruction, which will affect the country's survival and the people's livelihood. It is requested that your department promptly consult the provincial government to order an investigation and strictly prohibit unscrupulous merchants from exporting rice. If there are still cases of shipping rice to Taiwan, they should be severely punished to protect the national foundation and benefit the people. In addition, the price of flour in Fuzhou has also risen by about four jiao per bag due to the poor wheat harvest in the Americas and Canada. The current price for purchasing from Shanghai is three yuan, seven jiao, and eight fen per bag, plus two jiao for shipping and other expenses, so the selling price must be four yuan per bag. Fortunately, various flour mills in the city still have previously ordered goods, which have already yielded significant profits. Therefore, they are not following the current Shanghai market prices and are only selling at around three yuan and nine jiao in order to facilitate the circulation of goods and finance. However, due to the high price of flour, bread shops recently agreed to raise the price of bread by four wen per jin, while 包bread prices will not be raised, but the weight will be reduced.</p>

<p>In the past month, the export of Chinese silk has become increasingly prosperous, and silk cocoon market prices have gradually soared. Silk factories in this county are all stepping up their work to produce and sell goods. However, there is a severe shortage of raw dried cocoons, and market prices have risen, reaching more than 150 yuan per dan. Cocoon merchants are making considerable profits. Smaller silk factories fear that they will be unable to operate by the end of the year. Those with strong capital are buying as many dried cocoons as possible and stockpiling them in warehouses in preparation for opening in the spring. At this time of rising silk prices, silk merchants are selling futures silk in Shanghai. The current price of high white factory warp has risen to more than 850 yuan per package, and決silk has risen to 700 yuan. Compared with the time when autumn cocoons came on the market, Chinese silk is now 200 yuan per package higher. Observing the above situation, there is still a continued upward trend. This is also good news for the future of silk cocoons.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Nanhui: Landowners Request Reassessment of Land Prices <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Landowners in Dubei Xiang, Nanhui County, believing that the land tax assessment is too high and harms the people's livelihood, submitted a document to the Provincial Land Administration Bureau and the Nanhui County Government yesterday, stating: "We are submitting a petition because the land price assessment by the County Land Administration Bureau is too high, harming the people's livelihood. We request that the bureau be ordered to add additional appraisal committee members to reassess the land prices accurately to ensure fairness and reduce the burden on the people. Since the income from farmland has been repeatedly affected by poor harvests in recent years, the rural economy has been extremely depressed. Landowners find it difficult to collect rent, and tenants toil but suffer from hunger. As a result, the prices of land and property in the private sector have been declining, and even no one cares. It is hoped that after the collection of the excellent land tax, it can restore the people's difficulties and relieve their suffering to comply with the Prime Minister's will to reduce the burden on the people to benefit farmers. What is the reason for this absurdity? The current land Administration Bureau estimated land price is not rural reality. How should we know how to close the door to build a car in order to try to force with the original tax revenue has any reason for this? The sixth of our check zone Dubei township belongs to the 19 insurance of 10·11 chart 21 insurance of 24·26·20·chart. A uniform declared house site 95 yuan, agricultural land 90 yuan, pool 40 yuan, which is more than 40% higher than the market price, which is tantamount to increasing taxes and harming the people. It is not a way to enrich the country. The proprietors believe that the determination of the item of land price should be based on private real estate prices as the main component must not be estimated out of thin air with the intention of hiking with reference to the actual prices. The mood of the people will not be referenced The most low price of the pond to tax the pool with the highest price in the agricultural land to tax it with the intention of increasing taxes, the harm to the people. How can the proprietors be related to the skin? The proprietors pledge to do two copies for land investigation table, submit the document to ask for your approval. Approve the land administration bureau to add committee members to reassess the heavy burden. Not to mention again that the township has pushed Xing Zhigang · Yu Congzhou · Yao Zhizhang · Cai Qiuchi · Song Rixin to be representatives. To carry private deeds to the government to see the land price, ask for correction in addition to stating that.</p>

<p>The Jiangnan seawall is a water conservancy barrier for four counties, including Baoshan, and is very important for farmland irrigation. Therefore, the Jiangnan Water Conservancy Engineering Office attaches great importance to the seawall repair project. In addition to sending personnel to investigate last month, it also implemented an autumn flood repair project, which has been completed successively. In view of the fact that the dike must be strong to avoid flooding, a comprehensive repair is not enough to reverse the decline. Therefore, after sending personnel to investigate, a plan for the implementation of the seawall repair project was prepared. It is now learned that this plan has been submitted to the province for approval. The total project cost is more than 90,000 yuan. Regarding the organization of the project, the office plans to organize a seawall engineering office, and the candidate for the director will also be decided within days. As for the date of commencement of the seawall project, it can be carried out at the end of this month or early next month. According to news, the seawalls in Changshu, Taicang, Songjiang, and Baoshan counties have been cracked by wind and waves for a long time, and there are many places that need to be repaired. For all the required tree trunks and stone materials, the Jiangnan Water Conservancy Engineering Office, for the sake of caution, invited merchants to undertake the project. The bidding was opened in the assembly hall of the Construction Department on the 11th. However, because the bid price was higher than last year, it was not announced immediately. It will be determined after careful consideration.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Special District Rickshaw Guild Opposes Increasing License Fees, Deciding to Reduce Vehicles and Continue Negotiations <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Public Concession Public Works Bureau has decided to increase public rickshaw license fees from January 1st next year and reduce rickshaws by 500 on March 1st. The car dealers held a meeting yesterday to discuss it. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Increase License Fees and Reduce Car Rentals</p>
<p>Public rickshaw licenses are issued by the Public Works Bureau, the Public Concession Bureau, and the Public Works Bureau. The donation fee for the Public Concession is 2 yuan and 5 cents per month. Recently, the Public Works Bureau announced on October 22 that from January 1st next year, each license will be changed to 3 yuan and 5 jiao, which is an increase of 1 yuan and 4 jiao and 5 fen. However, for car rentals, it is stipulated that they will be reduced to a maximum of 7 jiao and 7 fen per day at the same time.</p>
<p>Reduce 500 Vehicles from Next Year</p>
<p>There were originally 10,000 public rickshaws in the Special District. Four years ago, 10 vehicles were cancelled by the Public Works Bureau due to a distant decree, so the actual number is only 9,990 vehicles. The bureau believes that rickshaws affect road traffic based on the recommendations of the Special Committee, so it decided to reduce 500 vehicles to 9,490 vehicles on March 1st next year. Although car dealers and rickshaw pullers have repeatedly requested opposition, there has been no result.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Meeting Discussed Negotiations and Opposition</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Special District Rickshaw Guild held a meeting. Gu Songmao, Hou Shao'an, Yin Zhiling, Bao Zhenhuang, Qiu Jixiang, Zheng Jian San, and others attended. Yin Zhiling presided over the meeting. After discussion, it was requested that the Special Committee on Rickshaws negotiate on the matter of increasing license fees, taking into account the difficulties of the merchants, and exempting it from implementation. As for the matter of reducing vehicles, according to the resolution of the general meeting, negotiations will continue.</p>

<h3 id="e122">China International Famine Relief Commission Celebrated its 15th Anniversary Yesterday, More Than 100 Chinese and Foreign Guests Attended, Changed its Future Working Guidelines and Raised 300,000 Yuan in Relief Funds <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission was established in Shanghai on November 16, 1921. Yesterday marked the 15th anniversary of its establishment. A commemorative meeting was held at the International General Association on Jing'an Temple Road at 7:30 PM yesterday. Chinese and foreign guests were invited to attend, to report on the principles and work of the association in the past. At the same time, a fundraising meeting was held. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Attending Guests</p>
<p>The guests who attended yesterday included Wu Tiecheng, Wang Zhengting (represented by Liu Yunfang), Yu Hongjun, Pan Gongzhan, Li Ting'an, Zhang Tingrong, Chen Guangfu, Li Dachao, Wei Wenbin, Liu Yuwan, Wang Yiting, Guo Chengen, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Liu Yunfang, and the Consuls of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany, the Soviet Union, Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland. There were more than 100 Chinese and foreign guests.</p>
<p>Work Report</p>
<p>Then a dinner party was held. After Liu Yunfang, representing Chairman Wang Zhengting, gave an opening speech, Guo Chengen reported on the association's past work, saying: (1) This association was established today in 1921, after a major drought in North China. At that time, although there were relief organizations in the country, they were not connected. Later, this association was formed. The general association was established in Beiping, and the original Chinese and foreign organizations were changed into branches. This is the process of its formation. (2) This association is a charitable organization jointly established by Chinese and foreign people. There is absolutely no political or religious boundary. Branches are established in 12 provinces including Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Suiyuan, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Sichuan. Offices are established in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places. This is the overview of the organization. (3) In terms of relief, this association not only saves the disasters that have already occurred, but also pays more attention to preventing future disasters. The goal of disaster prevention is construction. All things such as opening canals, digging wells, building roads and repairing embankments, and all kinds of facilities that facilitate people's livelihood are considered important tasks for disaster prevention. This is the so-called "construction relief" doctrine. (4) In the past 15 years, the association has spent more than 90 million yuan on emergency relief work. Larger projects include opening canals in the Weihe River in Shaanxi, digging wells in Hebei and Shandong provinces, and building embankments in Jiangxi, Hubei, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Anhui provinces. Other dredging of rivers has reached 290 miles, and building roads has reached 480 miles. The promotion of cooperatives, in particular, is pioneered by this association. As of April of this year, there were 2,865 cooperatives directly guided by this association, and the amount of loans to each cooperative reached 730,750 yuan.</p>
<p>Raising Huge Funds</p>
<p>At the same time, the holding of a fundraising meeting was announced. It is planned to raise 300,000 yuan, with Shanghai responsible for 100,000 yuan, and other places and overseas Chinese raising 200,000 yuan. The approval of the Ministry of Interior has already been obtained. As for the future improvement guidelines, three points have also been decided: (1) In the future, pay attention to rural construction projects. For rural highways and water conservancy, etc., assist those that are not covered by the national construction plan to promote their completion and facilitate rural areas. (2) Promote cooperative technology and help the Ministry of Industry promote cooperative undertakings. (3) Train disaster relief talents and float working staff to increase work efficiency. Finally, Mayor Wu gave a congratulatory speech, and Mr. An Xianjin gave a speech until 10 o'clock before everyone happily dispersed.</p>
<p>Mayor's Address</p>
<p>Today, the China International Famine Relief Commission is holding a 15th anniversary celebration. Tiecheng, as the honorary committee member of the Fundraising Committee of this association, is honored to attend the grand ceremony and gather with benevolent people from all walks of life at home and abroad. China has been plagued by disasters for many years, and the people have been displaced. Fortunately, benevolent people from all walks of life have been running around to provide relief out of their compassion, which has relieved the suffering of countless people and eliminated the hidden dangers of society. This merit is truly different from ordinary charitable acts. It is immeasurable to benefit the people and the country and the welfare of the people. Most of the work of this association is done by the efforts of friends from foreign countries. Tiecheng should propose and express his gratitude and admiration. "People drowning is like I drowning" and "People starving is like I starving." This is the embodiment of the inherent spirit of benevolence in China since ancient times. Since the establishment of this association, through the efforts of all of you for many years, this spirit has been carried forward. Tiecheng feels infinitely honored and gratified to follow you. However, the suffering of mankind is due to natural disasters on the one hand, and it is also caused by man-made disasters on the other hand. Before the organization of human society is reasonable, I am afraid that this suffering will be difficult to completely eliminate for a while. The world is still in a very turbulent and uneasy state. If we do not rush to save the future tragedies of mankind, we do not know where we will end up. This association is a group of benevolent people from various countries at home and abroad. I hope that we can carry forward the spirit of compassion and love that we have shown in the past 15 years, and launch a greater movement to eliminate the world's disasters invisibly. Then its benefits to the people will be endless. I wish you all good health and I wish you all greater success in your efforts.</p>

<p>Factories in Shanghai and other places have not yet resumed work, Yufeng Yarn Factory is brewing</p>
<p>The striking workers of the three Japanese-owned factories in the Hudong District, including Dakang, Gongda, and Donghua, have all returned to work in the factory the day before yesterday. However, the workers in the fine yarn room of the Shanghai No. 2, 3, 4, and 5 factories, and the Tongxing No. 2 factory have not yet resumed work, and a labor unrest is also brewing in the Yufeng factory. The workers of the six internal and external cotton factories in the Huxi District resumed work in the factory yesterday morning because the factory has increased wages. The workers of the Huamei Printing and Dyeing Factory also resumed work at the same time. The details are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Resumption of Work in Hudong Factories</p>
<p>The striking workers of the three Japanese-owned factories in the Hudong District, including Dakang, Gongda, and Donghua, have returned to work in the factory the day before yesterday after being earnestly persuaded by the party and government organs. There are still more than 300 workers in the fine yarn room of the Shanghai No. 2 and 3 factories and more than 300 workers in the reeling room who have not yet resumed work. More than 600 workers in the fine yarn room of the No. 4 and 5 factories have also not yet resumed work. Only half of the more than 2,500 workers in the day and night shifts of the Tongxing No. 2 factory have now resumed work. All the workers of the Yufeng Yarn Factory at the end of Yangshupu Road have also demanded an increase in wages. If the factory does not give a satisfactory reply, a labor unrest will inevitably occur. Therefore, the future of the labor unrest in the Japanese-owned yarn factories in the Hudong District is still difficult to quell.</p>
<p>Internal and External Six Factories Agree to Increase Wages</p>
<p>After the announcement of the strike by all the workers of the Internal and External Cotton No. 6 Factory in the West Suzhou River in the Huxi District, the party and government organs have sent people to persuade them, and the foremen have negotiated with the factory. Therefore, the factory has agreed to increase wages, and all the workers have entered the factory at 6:00 AM yesterday. The factory's notice is recorded as follows: "Our factory has already announced on November 14 that the wage increase is limited to 5%, which will be calculated from November 11. This is a special notice." It is also learned that the factory announced at the same time yesterday that the workers (No. 549), (No. 562), (No. 526), (No. 569), (No. 575), (No. 578), and (No. 634) have been dismissed. Upon hearing the news, the workers expressed their dissatisfaction with the factory's dismissal of workers without cause.</p>
<p>Workers of Meihua Dyeing Factory Resumed Work</p>
<p>After the strike by all the male and female workers of the Japanese-owned Meihua Printing and Dyeing Factory at No. 595 Hejian Road in the Hudong District, demanding an increase in wages, the labor and management sides negotiated on their own. As a result, it was decided to increase wages by 2% across the board. The remaining conditions will be negotiated again. All the workers have expressed their agreement with this condition, so it was decided to resume work in the factory at 6:00 AM yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Fine Yarn Workers of New Ewo Gunny Bag Factory Strike Against Wage Cuts, Workers' Representatives Arrested, Labor Side Proposes Conditions <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The British-owned New Ewo Gunny Bag Factory next to the Yangshupu Water Plant employs more than 1,000 workers. There are now more than 300 connecting workers in the fine yarn room who are unable to make a living due to the exploitation of wage by the contractor. They demanded restoration, but failed to get what they wanted. Therefore, they jointly went on strike from 6:00 PM the day before yesterday (November 14) and put forward seven demands. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Strike Occurs</p>
<p>More than 300 connecting workers in the fine yarn room of the New Ewo Gunny Bag Factory used to earn 3 jiao and 5 fen per day. Recently, the contractors Ding Rongkun and Chen Asan unreasonably cut it to 2 jiao and 8 fen. Because they could not make a living, they demanded restoration, but failed to get what they wanted. Therefore, they went on strike from 6:00 PM the day before yesterday (November 14) to urge the contractors to realize their mistakes. However, because the workers have no organization, no one dares to come forward to negotiate. Then there were Qu A'er and Huang A'san who verbally guaranteed to the workers that the contractors would never oppress the workers and that representatives could be sent to the head office for negotiations. Cao Wanqing and Ji Shouhua were elected by the workshop to negotiate with Ding Rongkun, the general contractor. However, Ding refused in every possible way, resulting in no result. Therefore, at 7:00 AM yesterday, they went to Tao Bingnan's home, the head of the head office, for negotiations. Unexpectedly, Qu A'er and Huang A'san dragged the workers' representatives to the factory and beat them severely, and reported them to the Yulin Road Police Station, which detained the workers, who have not been released yet. Upon hearing the news, all the workers were indignant and held an emergency meeting yesterday, putting forward seven demands. If there is no result, they will continue to strike to urge the contractors to realize their mistakes.</p>
<p>Seven Demands</p>
<p>After the contractor reported the workers' representatives to the police station and detained them, all the workers expressed their indignation. Seven demands were put forward: (1) Immediately release the workers' representatives Cao Wanqing and Ji Shouhua. (2) Increase wages by 20%. (3) After working for two weeks, wages must be increased for two days, and shift work must be arranged every Sunday. (4) Give an additional 1 jiao for wiping each car. (5) Increase wages by 2 jiao per day per person for 8 taels of yarn. (6) No arbitrary fines or beatings of workers. (7) Request for the issuance of year-end bonuses at the end of the year. The above conditions have now been written by the labor side and directly submitted to the general foreman Smith, requesting him to accept them.</p>

It is now understood that the British and American consulates and chambers of commerce in this city, recognizing that this tax is a sound global practice and that foreign residents in China should bear the obligation to pay, previously telegraphed their respective governments for instructions. Approval has now been received, indicating agreement. Therefore, there are no issues with British and American merchants paying taxes. As for other countries, no specific opinions have been expressed yet. The Shanghai office of the Ministry of Finance's Income Tax Affairs Office has been collecting the second category of income tax since the first day of last month for over a month. The tax amounts payable by foreign nationals for October will be settled and collected.

<p>The Joint Office of the Chinese Southeast Associations of the World Red Cross Society received a telegram from Commanders Gao Guizi and He Shaonan of Northern Shaanxi, stating that Northern Shaanxi has suffered from banditry for years, homes are destroyed, and families are ruined. The disaster victims have no complete clothes and are starving. Many are dying of hunger and cold, requesting aid in the form of cotton clothes to save lives. The office believes that the disaster situation in Northern Shaanxi, which has suffered from both banditry and natural disasters, with widespread deaths, is no less severe than in Jiangxi. Relief should be provided as much as possible. Letters have been sent to various Southeast associations to raise funds together. However, the disaster area in Northern Shaanxi is vast, and there are many disaster victims. A small number of cotton clothes will not help. It is hoped that philanthropists at home and abroad will raise cotton clothes on their behalf, regardless of quantity, new or old, and send them to the association's office at No. 4 Tongfu Lane, Julai Road, French Concession, to be collected and transported to the disaster area for relief.</p>

<p>Paying Homage to the Mi San Public Cemetery and Commemorative Parade</p>
<p>On November 16, 1929, Mr. and Mrs. Niu Yangsheng of Yutang, Shanghai, used the funds given by relatives and friends for the 100th birthday of their ancestor, Mi San, and Madam Wang, to establish the private Yutang Public Education Center, promoting public education. There were also the Qiangshu Horticulture School, Agricultural Training Class, and Women's Self-Help Society, all established and actively managed by private funding. Yutang, originally a remote area, has seen its business achieve results after many years of operation. In recent years, it has also been able to occupy a place in rural education, with some reputation. In recent years, the establishment of the Yongfu Industrial School, with its integration of industry and education, has also made practical contributions to rural education. Local people decided last year to designate November 16th each year as Yutang Local Memorial Day, which is the founding day of Yutang's educational cause. In addition to commemorating Mi San's birthday and the educational cause, meetings are also held on this day for research and to explore the progress of the cause. This year is the first time it is being held. Preparations have been made by the preparatory staff of the memorial meeting launched by various agencies in Yutang. It is reported that at 7:00 AM on the morning, staff of various agencies and residents of the teaching area held a tomb sweeping ceremony in front of the Wei San Public Cemetery. At 9:00 AM, they paraded in a line, and upon arrival, a brief report on the cause was given. The parade participants also raised questions about their respective causes within the prescribed time for mutual research. In the afternoon, a commemorative ceremony was held in the auditorium of the Education Center, with additional performances. A colored film was shown in the evening.</p>

<p>Since Sheng Shengyi was transferred to be the director of the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Unified Tax Bureau, he has spared no effort in reforming the tax policy. In order to fundamentally eradicate the accumulated malpractices of tax evasion, four inspectors have been added to the tax management offices in Ningbo, Haimen, Wenzhou, and other places for rotational inspection, implementing both overt and covert investigations. Furthermore, in order to save office time and increase the time for researching and reforming tax policies, following the methods of European and Western countries, all routine documents that are not urgent are sent by form. The reason only needs to be indicated on the form. The forms are divided into two types: A and B. "Delivery Certificate" is used for outports, and "Delivery Certificate" is used for the city. Each type is divided into original and duplicate sheets. If there is no special accident, the original sheet is filed, and the duplicate sheet is returned to the original presenting agency for record, without separate instructions. Since its implementation on October 1st, the office staff has found it convenient. In addition, a design committee has been organized within the bureau, with specialized personnel as members. The committee members are engaged in research on how to reform the tax policy and how to prevent smuggling, with the aim of being proper. The necessary expenses are all paid by the bureau director from his personal salary. Other investigations into privately made cigarettes (i.e., hand-cranked iron machines, wooden frames, etc.) and the selection and use of personnel are also being planned.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Muslims Begin Month of Fasting Yesterday Morning <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Muslims in this city are required to fast for one month every Ramadan (September) of the Islamic calendar (i.e., abstain from food). Yesterday marked the beginning of the month of Ramadan in the Islamic calendar, and Muslims gathered in mosques to bathe and pray before beginning the fast. Both men and women are required to fast. The time for fasting is from the moment the east is illuminated until the sun sets. During this time, eating, drinking, sexual intercourse, and all improper behavior are prohibited. Conditions that do not break the fast include forgetting to eat or drink, nocturnal emission, etc. Conditions that break the fast include intentionally eating, drinking, or having sexual intercourse during the day. However, sexual intercourse is not prohibited at night. The Quran states, "On the night of fasting, you may have intercourse with your wives. They are your garments, and you are their garments." Chapter 2, Verse 148. However, after sexual intercourse, a major ablution (i.e., bathing) is required. Every night at 7:00 PM during this month, Muslims in mosques across the city will hold prayers.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Jianghai Customs Uncovers Major Fraud Case: Lu Zhiqing Privately Makes Keys to Open Boxes and Steal Bills of Lading; Retrieves Goods from China Merchants Bureau and Sells Them for Profit; Seven Keys in Total; Previously Committed Multiple Offenses <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Lu Zhiqing, a Ningbo native who previously worked as a customs broker at the Minli Customs Brokerage in this city, became unemployed. Familiar with customs declaration and shipping procedures, he knew that, according to custom, customs brokerages would first send the bills of lading to the customs authorities for inspection after the goods were imported and loaded onto the pier. To avoid brokers waiting for too long, the customs set up large iron storage boxes, numbered separately, to store the bills of lading of each brokerage. Each brokerage had its own key to open the box</p>
<p>according to the listed number</p>
<p>to retrieve the bills and ship the goods. When Lu was employed, he used lead to imitate the keys of various brokerages, totaling seven. Recently, due to extreme boredom, he came up with a whimsical idea to use the fake keys to open the boxes and fraudulently obtain goods. Most recently, he learned that the Jingji Customs Brokerage on Zilai Street in the French Concession was entrusted by Renfeng Hakka in Hankou to handle customs procedures in Shanghai. The Hakka entrusted the transportation of ten boxes of lotus seeds, worth 550 yuan,</p>
<p>to the China Merchants Bureau's Jiang'an Steamer.</p>
<p>When the ship arrived in port at 9:30 AM on the 9th of this month, the brokerage sent the bill of lading for the goods to the customs for inspection. When the customs issued the bill, Lu used the fake key to open the brokerage's storage box No. 741, took out the original bill, and at 3:00 PM on the 10th, hired two "Tiger Cars" from the Guangdng Road branch of the Anli Automobile Transportation Company at No. 64 Guangdong Road and transported the ten boxes of lotus seeds from the No. 17 warehouse of the China Merchants Bureau's South Pier. The two carters, Shi Jiayao and Ma San,</p>
<p>each carried five boxes</p>
<p>According to the address Lu provided, the cars went to No. 115 Hele Lane at the intersection of North Henan Road and Haining Road, where Qin Chang Printing Paper's Li Hui Rong was to receive the goods. When the first car arrived at the entrance of the lane, someone took the goods and transported them elsewhere. However, the car driven by Ma San was spotted by Chinese police officer No. 277 in the Hongkou area, who ordered the goods to be divided into two cars because they were overloaded. This caused a delay. When the divided car arrived at the destination again,</p>
<p>no one was there to receive the goods.</p>
<p>After searching everywhere for Li Hui Rong of Qin Chang, it was impossible to find him. They had no choice but to temporarily store the car at the Hongkou police station. This is the story of Lu's fraud. However, the Jingji Customs Brokerage had been waiting for the bill of lading without any news. It was not until the morning of the 11th that they inquired with the customs and learned that the bill of lading had been issued the day before. Fearing that it had been lost, they rushed to the China Merchants Bureau to stop the goods from being unloaded. Unexpectedly, the ten boxes of lotus seeds had been taken away with the bill the day before. They then learned that the bill was signed with</p>
<p>the words "Ke Zheng"</p>
<p>and stamped with the Anli Automobile Transportation Company seal. They reported the incident to the customs police station for investigation. The police station, recognizing the seriousness of the case, immediately dispatched detectives Cheng Yongnian, Wang Haiquan, Qu Hequi, Gu Wenkui, Liang Shenqing, Zhou Zenghua, and Hu Deqing to investigate separately. They first went to the Anli main branch on Dengtuo Road in the public concession to investigate. They learned that there was indeed a person named Wang Kezheng, who was the accountant at the Guangdong Road branch. They then worked with the central police station to bring Wang</p>
<p>and the carters, Shi and Ma,</p>
<p>who transported the stolen goods, to the police station. They testified that Lu Zhiqing instructed them to transport the goods. Lu used to hire an old carter named Gu when he worked at Minli, so he knew him. They were completely unaware that the lotus seeds were fraudulently obtained. The detectives then went to Minli to meet with manager Zhang Yongxing. They learned that Lu was introduced by Xie. Based on this clue, they set out to capture Lu. Lu fully admitted to the fraud, but</p>
<p>repeatedly lied</p>
<p>about the location of the stolen goods, causing the detectives to conduct empty searches multiple times. Finally, he revealed everything. According to his confession, five boxes of the original stolen goods were hidden in a vacant coffin on the upper floor of the Huiheji store at No. 129 Xueyuan Road, Guangqi Road in the city. They immediately worked with the Yimiao police station to recover the original stolen goods at the address. Some of them had already been sold. They also confiscated seven fake lead keys, three fake seals of customs brokerages, a cargo manifest from the Red Heart Canned Foods Company, and various customs brokerages'</p>
<p>cargo permits.</p>
<p>They also took Hui Yongfeng, the owner of the store, who was hiding the stolen goods, into custody. The detectives then asked Lu what he needed the Red Heart Canned Foods Company's cargo manifest for. Lu then confessed that on September 12th of this year, he had used the same method to fraudulently obtain ten boxes of grapes from Tongtai Customs Brokerage, each box containing forty-eight cans. Because he had nowhere to sell them, he falsely used the name of the Red Heart Company to sell them, and most of them had been sold. Only one hundred and seventy-nine cans</p>
<p>were recovered.</p>
<p>The seven keys that were obtained could open the storage boxes of the Jingji, Yongxingchang Dachang, Gongxing, Meisheng, Tongtai, Nantong, Tongfengtai, Taiguchang, and other brokerages. The detectives recovered all the remaining grapes and ordered the Jingji and Tongtai brokerages to claim the recovered stolen goods. Since Lu claimed that the fake keys could still open the iron boxes of other brokerages, fearing that other brokerages had also been defrauded, the two criminals were kept in custody for continued investigation to handle the case.</p>

The Hankou water level is only eight feet two inches, Jiujiang is only nine feet three inches, Anqing is only seven feet seven inches, and Wuhu is only six feet. Since these figures represent the number of feet above the lowest water level, according to the draft restrictions for ships announced by the Customs yesterday, only a load capacity of fourteen feet four inches is permitted for the Wuhu-Jiujiang section, and a load capacity of eleven feet eight inches is permitted for the Jiujiang-Hankou section. Therefore, navigation on the Shanghai-Hankou section is extremely difficult.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau solved the Xuan Sheng assassination case. The perpetrators Wang Zhensheng, Mao Yonghu, Zhao Yunhong, Jin Daozhen, and related women Wang Zai and Zhang Mo, totaling six individuals, were found to be involved. The investigation revealed that the accused were instigated by Hua Ke, a cadre of the reactionary faction, to disrupt order and cause international disputes. They confessed and were transferred to the District Court Procuratorate. After repeated investigations and clear evidence, the prosecutor has indicted the accused on charges of murder. After the entire case file was transferred to the criminal court, the trial is expected to open soon. However, the accused are in custody, and their families, fearing implication, have not visited them in jail. Therefore, defense lawyers have not been hired. The court will appoint public defenders to represent them in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Minsheng Company's Minyu Vessel Grounded En Route from Yichang to Chongqing; Minsheng, Minzhi, Minxuan, and Minting Vessels Dispatched for Rescue; Passengers and Cargo Transferred to Minzhi Vessel, Which Arrived in Chongqing Yesterday <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Minsheng Industrial Company's Minyu vessel, which runs on the Yichang-Chongqing route, grounded while carrying cargo and passengers from Yichang to Chongqing on the morning of the 15th of this month in the Shijiahe section of the Yangtze River near Changshou. The company dispatched four vessels, Minsheng, Minzhi, Minxuan, and Minting, for rescue. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Accidental Grounding</p>
<p>The Minyu vessel has a gross tonnage of 232 tons and a net tonnage of 119 tons. It usually travels on the Chongqing-Fuling-Wanxian route. Due to the current dry season on the Sichuan River, it switched to the Yichang-Chongqing route. On November 13th, it transferred cargo and passengers from the Shanghai-Yichang Qianminquan vessel in Yichang and set sail for Chongqing. On the morning of the 15th, it ran aground on a reef in the Shijiahe section of the Yangtze River near Changshou. As a result, the bottom of the ship was breached by the reef, and river water flooded in. The captain tried to rescue the vessel, but his efforts were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Four Vessels for Rescue</p>
<p>The captain immediately put on full speed and steered the vessel to a sandy beach to prevent it from sinking. At the same time, he telegraphed the company to dispatch vessels for rescue. Upon receiving the report, the Chongqing General Company immediately dispatched four vessels: the Minsheng vessel with a gross tonnage of 71 tons, the Minzhi vessel with a gross tonnage of 216 tons, the Minxuan vessel with a gross tonnage of 153 tons, and the Minting vessel with a gross tonnage of 64 tons, to the scene of the accident for rescue.</p>
<p>Passengers Arrive in Chongqing</p>
<p>The Minsheng, Minzhi, Minxuan, and Minting vessels have all arrived at the scene of the Minyu accident. All passengers were transferred to the Minzhi vessel, and the cargo was also transferred to the Minzhi vessel for transport to Chongqing. Fortunately, the dozens of passengers were all unharmed. However, some of the cargo in the hold had been damaged by water. The Minzhi vessel safely arrived in Chongqing yesterday.</p>
<p>Efforts to Tow Back</p>
<p>As for the grounded Minyu vessel, the Minxuan, Minting, and Minsheng vessels are making efforts to tow it back. The breached area is being sealed with cement, and the water that flooded in is being pumped out. The vessel is currently still grounded on the sandy beach. After the water level rises, further efforts will be made to tow it back to Chongqing for repairs in the shipyard. It is reported that the losses are considerable.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Animal Protection Society Requests Strict Prohibition of Slaughtering Pregnant Sheep and Live Deer for Antlers to Curb Cruelty and Maintain Animal Husbandry <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The China Animal Protection Society, based on a letter from Gao Depei, an animal husbandry instructor in Fengxian County, requesting that the authorities strictly prohibit the cruel slaughter of pregnant sheep, and based on a letter from member Zhu Guixin requesting a ban on slaughtering deer for antlers, submitted letters to the relevant authorities yesterday, requesting prompt action to stop the practice, curb cruelty, and preserve animal husbandry. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibit the Cruel Slaughter of Pregnant Sheep</p>
<p>Ye Gongchuo, Chairman of the Society, and Guan Jiongzhi, Vice Chairman, submitted a letter to both the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Industry, stating: "We are submitting this report based on information received. According to a letter from Gao Depei, an animal husbandry instructor at the Fengxian County Agricultural Extension Office, foreign merchants have recently been buying pregnant ewes in the northern part of our country, luring farmers to strip the skin from the unborn lambs. As a result, in recent years, there have been tens of thousands of brokers trading in this type of raw skin in the areas north of the Yangtze River and in Shandong Province. This has led to a significant decrease in the number of sheep in the Jiangbei region in the past two years. Taking Fengxian County as an example, the number of sheep three years ago was 210,000, but in recent years, there have only been 40,000 to 50,000. If this continues, the breed of sheep will be extinct in the future. Farmers' cruel slaughter of pregnant ewes is inhumane and should be prohibited by law. It also hinders the current promotion of animal husbandry and breed improvement. Depei's duty is to report to the relevant industry and construction authorities for verification. We are also sending this letter to your society, with the aim of protecting animals, to request the central government to issue a strict ban. This will greatly benefit the future of animal husbandry in China." The cruel slaughter of pregnant sheep is extremely inhumane, killing two lives with one act, and is against human ethics. Such destruction not only hinders the future of animal husbandry but also threatens the extinction of sheep. Therefore, we submit this report to the authorities for review, requesting that you promptly issue a notice to all provinces to strictly prohibit this practice, to protect animal life and promote benevolence, which would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Prohibit Slaughtering Deer for Antlers</p>
<p>Ye and Guan, the two chairmen of the society, sent a letter to the Nantong County government yesterday, requesting a ban on slaughtering deer for antlers. The letter stated: "According to a letter from Zhu Guisheng, the Suisheng Pharmacy outside the South Gate of your jurisdiction has scheduled the slaughter of deer for antlers on November 18th, and has widely advertised this event. These innocent animals will suffer a tragic slaughter. Please take action to rescue them." The deer antlers sold by pharmacies are cut from live deer. Not only is the sight of animals trembling and dying unbearable for benevolent people, but the surrounding onlookers can also easily cause cruel practices, which are against human ethics. We are sending this letter to your county government for investigation and prevention, to curb cruelty and rectify people's hearts. We also hope that you will investigate and reply.</p>

<p>Chu Xiangfu, a local resident of No. 5 Shanqing Lane, Ninghe, in the city, is 70 years old. His wife, Sun, is 63 years old. They have only one son, Chu Junsheng, who is 30 years old. He is both the heir to the family line and a adopted son, and a promising young man. He works at a gold exchange. Because he is filial to his parents and trustworthy, he is not yet married at the age of 30. He believes that he must be self-sufficient and have money before getting married. So, he did not marry until March 20th of this year, when he married a Miss Yao from Tangjia Lane. She is 20 years old and has good qualities. The family was harmonious and happy, and the two elders were always smiling. Who would have thought that starting this year, all industries would be depressed? He had to resort to speculation and was heavily indebted by Yu Chao in Lan. Chu Junsheng, a conservative and decent man, did not tell his parents about this. As his debts piled up and life became difficult, he had the idea of suicide for a long time, and his beloved wife in the boudoir agreed to die with him. However, they did not reveal their plans, fearing to hurt the elders. A few days ago, he once told his mother that he wanted to travel to Nanjing. His mother stopped him because the weather was bad and the journey would be difficult. Unexpectedly, the young couple went out together the day before yesterday and returned late. His mother asked them about their dinner. Junsheng said that they had eaten at his wife's family. They slept until 7:30 AM yesterday. His mother saw that her son and daughter-in-law had not gotten up yet. Because they always got up at 7:00 AM to wash, dress, and have breakfast before going out, she told the maid to check on them. She heard groaning and was frightened to report to her mistress. Sun opened the door and saw that her daughter-in-law was dead, and her son was foaming at the mouth and groaning incessantly. She immediately sent her son to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. He was diagnosed with suicide by poison, but he was in a coma and still in critical condition. As for the dead daughter-in-law, the police station ordered the local security guard Zhu Shunqing to report to the District Court. Inspector Lei was commissioned to examine the body. The Chu elders were in tears all day, grieving beyond words. It is a truly tragic event.</p>

<p>Moore Memorial Church on Thachin Road in this city, in order to promote the truth of the cross, has scheduled public lectures on "The Wonderful Cross," "The Victorious Cross," and "The Glorious Cross" in the church's main hall at 5:30 PM to 6:30 PM on the afternoons of the 16th, 17th, and 18th. The lectures will be given by Pastor Jiang Changchuan each day. A rotating neon cross will be erected on the top of the church's seven-story bell tower, and will be lit on the 18th. Bishop Mu will personally dedicate the cross. It reaches high into the clouds and is visible from afar. The base is made of steel and is powered by a motor that rotates it continuously. It weighs over 2,200 pounds and was manufactured in the United States. A year ago, when Mr. Shi Huide from Stockton, California, USA, came to Shanghai, he was deeply moved by the church's work and donated the cross. There are still two lectures to be given today and tomorrow. Members of the public are welcome to attend.</p>

<p>The China Women's Temperance Association on Yuanmingyuan Road in this city is launching a fundraising campaign this autumn to raise 20,000 yuan in cash to expand its organization and celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Shanghai Women and Children's Education Institute, an affiliate. To meet social and institutional needs: 5,000 yuan to build a nursing home, 5,000 yuan to build a poor children's daycare center, 2,000 yuan for equipment for both institutions, and the remainder to be used as operating expenses for next year. The 5,000 yuan for the nursing home has already been donated by Sir Elly Kadoone, a British Jew, and construction is underway. However, the remaining 15,000 yuan is not yet secured. To complete the original plan and maintain the current life and education expenses of the women and children at the Education Institute, it has been decided to raise the money within the year and to proceed in three areas: (1) Recruiting members, with members of the membership department Zhang Yadai, Wang Xiwun, Shen Airong, and Yang Yanwei responsible for preparations. (2) Extensive fundraising, with all directors Wu Lao Weiqing, Mao Wang Ruizhu, Mrs. Li Zhongdao, Mrs. Wang Ruilin, and Mrs. Feng Yukang responsible for preparations. (3) Holding an international music assembly, with the director of the association, Mrs. Liu Wang Liming, inviting female leaders and music experts from various countries to jointly prepare. It is reported that preparations are nearing completion, and the date should be announced soon.</p>

<p>In addition to the destruction of several buildings in a fire at the Gao Yongxing Camel Wool Factory at No. 13 Changkang Lane, Arabella Street, on the morning of the 13th of this month, seven workers at the factory were also killed in the fire because they could not escape in time. Subsequently, firefighters pulled out six bodies from the fire scene and transported them to the Philand Road morgue. The next morning, Inspector Song from the First Special Court came to the morgue to verify the bodies and ordered the factory owner to temporarily provide coffins. As previously reported in the newspapers, it has been learned that firefighters have pulled out another body. The factory accountants identified the body as Zhao Zixiang. Therefore, the previously reported missing Shao Fugen was actually a misidentification due to the charred condition of both bodies. Yesterday morning, Inspector Zhang from the First Special Court came to the morgue to verify Zhao's body and ordered Gao Buquan to provide a bond and coffins.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Female Dancer from Sanle Dance Company Swindled After Responding to Advertisement at Hotel; Mr. Zhang Forcibly Borrowed Gold Ring and Refused to Return It; Teahouse Worker Wang Yongchen is an Accomplice; Another Female Dancer Previously Swindled <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>At 1:40 PM the day before yesterday, the Sanle Dance Company at No. 18 Ren'an Lane, Guling Road, suddenly received a phone call from a Mr. Zhang, ordering them to send a female dancer to room 37 of the Card Hotel at No. 8 Lane 143, Carter Road. The company ordered dancer No. 8, Zhang Xiuying from Huzhou (age 20), to go. Upon arriving at the hotel, she was led to room 37 by the teahouse worker, Wang Yongchen from Changzhou.</p>
<p>There was a Man in the Room</p>
<p>Who claimed to be the Mr. Zhang who had called. After a considerable amount of time, around 4:00 PM, Mr. Zhang ordered Zhang Xiuying to sleep with him. Zhang refused and shouted loudly, but Wang Yongchen turned a deaf ear and did not enter the room to intervene. Seeing that Zhang Xiuying was wearing a gold ring worth about 20 yuan, the man had bad intentions. He asked to</p>
<p>Borrow Zhang's Ring</p>
<p>To look at the style, and took it off her finger and put it on his own finger. Zhang asked for it back, but he refused to return it, leading to another dispute. At that time, Wang Yongchen entered the room and said to Zhang Xiuying, "Mr. Zhang is a young master and would not be surprised even by a diamond ring. Why bother about a mere gold ring?" The woman had no choice. Around 5:00 PM, Mr. Zhang and Wang Yongchen suddenly left together. The woman asked where they were going, and they said they were going out to shop and would be back in a few minutes. However, after more than twenty minutes,</p>
<p>Zhang had not Returned.</p>
<p>So she immediately called the company to report what had happened. The company sent the accountant, Wang Yuanfu, to the Card Hotel to investigate and accompanied Zhang to report to the Xinza Police Station. The police dispatched Chinese detective Xu Zhiqin to investigate. However, Mr. Zhang had already fled. When questioning Wang Yongchen about Zhang's whereabouts, Wang firmly claimed that he did not know. When asked why he had touted Zhang as a young master, Wang also denied it. Detective Xu</p>
<p>Suspected Wang</p>
<p>And searched him, finding a gold ring in Wang's pocket. Zhang Xiuying recognized the ring as belonging to dancer No. 2, Song Lijun from Ningbo, at the same company. The detective then summoned Song. According to Song, on the afternoon of the 13th of the month, Mr. Zhang had also summoned her to this room. At that time, he also took her ring, claiming to want to look at it. When she left the room to answer a phone call and talk to a roommate, Zhang disappeared. When she questioned Wang, he confessed that Mr. Zhang had</p>
<p>Pawned the Ring</p>
<p>At a pawnshop for two yuan, and he had redeemed it. The detective then took Wang to the police station and detained him. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Qian Xun, prosecuted him under Article 320 of the Criminal Code. Because further investigation was needed, he requested permission to reschedule the trial. Then, Zhang Xiuying and Song Lijun submitted a detailed account of what had happened. After questioning Wang Yongchen, Judge Pan Zhenyang verified the confession and ordered a rescheduled trial.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Li Guojie Case: The Court Summoned Again Yesterday; Li Has Submitted a Petition to the Premier of the Executive Yuan Requesting Pardon and Compensation; The Court Will Summon Guarantor Yu Qiaqing <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Li Guojie, the former general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, mortgaged four warehouses to the China Business Corporation and entered into a ship charter agreement with the Dalai Shipping Company, damaging national sovereignty. Because he wanted to establish the agreement, he bribed Chen Fumu, the director of the Bureau, with a 700,000 tael kickback. Zhu Jiahao, the former Minister of Communications, investigated and arrested Li Guojie. The Supreme Court's final judgment sentenced him to eight months imprisonment, suspended for two years, and ordered him to return the 700,000 taels of silver and interest to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, totaling over 1.2 million. In the civil lawsuit, Li Sihao and Yu Qiaqing posted bail on June 6th of this year, but no money has been paid. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has also advertised a reward to find Li's private property, but to no avail, requesting the court to continue execution. On the first of this month, Judge Yu Lude held a hearing. The plaintiff's lawyer requested that Li Guojie be declared bankrupt. Li, due to his social status, did not want to be declared bankrupt, and claimed that he had petitioned the Executive Yuan for pardon and compensation. The judge ordered Li Guojie to provide property within fifteen days, and the case was rescheduled for the 16th of this month. Li Guojie's petition to the National Government for pardon has reportedly been reviewed by the Judicial Yuan. It has been decided that judicial independence and the plaintiff's request for withdrawal are without legal basis and have been rejected. At the same time, the District Court held another hearing yesterday, but Li Guojie submitted a statement on Saturday, the 14th of this month, stating that he was ill and requested a rescheduling of the trial. Therefore, Li did not appear yesterday, and the trial could not proceed. Only the plaintiff's lawyer, Jiang Hechun, appeared in court and stated that when the guarantors Li and Yu provided the guarantee, they said they could find a way. Please handle it according to the law. The judge scheduled a hearing with the guarantors for December 7th.</p>

<p>A General Overview of Shanghai's Industry and Commerce Changes in July and August of This Year (Continued) (XXXVIII of the General Overview of Shanghai's Industry and Commerce) Chinese Credit Compilation Chief Editor</p>
<p>The following are major changes in the shipping and hotel industries under the special industry category:</p>
<p>1.  Yuda Shipping Company's Shanghai Branch Closes Down - The company's head office was located in Yingkou, established by Chinese merchants Bao Yucai and others. It held a significant position in the shipping industry in North China. After the fall of the Northeast, the company was once confiscated by the puppet Manchukuo authorities because it was believed to have shares held by important figures from the Northeast. Later, after efforts by local business circles, the puppet state registered its shares and sent personnel to monitor it before resuming operations. Unexpectedly, in the summer of the 1923rd year, the puppet authorities took over the company again and appointed a Japanese person as the general manager. Since then, the company's ships have been exclusively engaged in transporting Japanese goods to and from Yingkou and Japan. In recent years, smuggling has been rampant, and Yuda's ships have been used as tools for carrying contraband, flying the puppet state's flag and refusing inspection.</p>
<p>The Longkou Customs authorities detained it. However, the ship that was detained eventually took advantage of the Customs' unpreparedness and escaped on its own. After the Customs learned about this, in addition to issuing a general order for investigation and arrest, it also revoked the license. The Shanghai branch of the company, seeing that the ship was unable to come south again, and assuming that the remaining two ships would be the same, immediately announced its closure.</p>
<p>2.  Paramount Hotel Closes - This hotel was a well-known large-scale hotel in Shanghai, established in the winter of the 1923rd year. It was under the jurisdiction of the Dacheng Co., Ltd., with Gu Chongqing as the chairman of the board and Zhu Hongru as the general manager. Since its opening, although it has been known for its complete equipment and outstanding reputation, the market has been sluggish and business has not improved. Most of the street-front houses have not been rented out, and the losses have been unsustainable. The company convened an emergency shareholders' meeting on July 10th. It was resolved that the board of directors would do its best to maintain the status quo under the following two major principles: first, to avoid closure as much as possible and handle liquidation or call-up procedures; second, if closure was inevitable, it should be implemented one month later. The board of directors now believes that the time has indeed come when it is absolutely necessary, and the one-month period has also passed. Therefore, it has announced the closure and is handling the aftermath.</p>
<p>Gleanings of Spring and Autumn (Xu Xiaoting)</p>
<p>It is easy to see the surface spots of things, but not the inner erosion. Only seeing the truth on the surface and not looking at the dangers inside is a common problem for people in this new era.</p>
<p>On the level of joy, there are sometimes jumping points of fear. In the fields of fear, there are sometimes seeds of joy. To distinguish and recognize requires a clear mind to easily respond.</p>
<p>Society is a kaleidoscope. The internal complexity can easily make people dizzy. It is clear that one is standing in the circle of happiness, but a misstep can lead to the abyss of fear. It is clear that one has fallen into the abyss of fear, but a jump can lead to the circle of happiness. The subtle mysteries are difficult for ordinary young people to understand.</p>
<p>We know to avoid polluted air, we know to improve unclean drinks, but we do not know to escape dangerous roads in society. This is the harm of recognizing the surface but not the inner layers. It is like biting into a hollow pear. From the sweet flesh, we must guard against the terrible worms wriggling in the core.</p>
<p>Remembering the National Hero Lü Xiaochun (Qiulang)</p>
<p>Mr. Lü Liuliang of Yuxi (ie Chongde), styled Wancun, was born at the end of the Ming Dynasty. He had great ambitions and was well-versed in literature, writing extensively. Because he lamented the collapse of the Ming society and the Han people falling under foreign rule, he established theories and wrote articles to advocate revolution, eagerly thinking of reviving the Han cause. Because of this, he offended the Qing court, causing literary persecution that led to his coffin being opened and his corpse mutilated, and implicated his relatives. Alas, the fate of national heroes is truly tragic and cruel!</p>
<p>The other day, while drinking at Qi's house, a certain gentleman from Xixiang told me in great detail about Mr. Lü's anecdotes. At a time when the country is facing internal troubles and daily increasing foreign threats, I am even more inclined to cherish this national hero! Mr. Lü's morality and writing were highly regarded by the literary circles at the time. Therefore, many famous officials, scholars, and patriots came to pay their respects. But in his actions and movements, Mr. Lü always hated the Manchus as enemies. When going out, regardless of the weather, he always wore wooden thick-soled clogs and carried an umbrella on his shoulder. His intention was probably not to share the same sky with the foreign race. Mr. Lü had one wife and one concubine, and several children. The strangest thing was that once, when he was near death, he summoned his children to his front and earnestly instructed them that on his remains, they should make another long board on which the four characters "Seeing the Sun Again" should be written, and he instructed that it should be buried in the rightmost hole in the grave (according to secular burial custom, Mr. Lü should be in the middle, the wife on the left, and the concubine on the right). Otherwise, it would be a great act of filial impiety. By the time the Qing court made its final judgment, Mr. Lü, his wife, and his concubine had all passed away. Because of the strict order to investigate and destroy all books, the officials were ordered to exhume the corpse! And all relatives were imprisoned and punished. However, the official sent was also Mr. Lü's student, but fearing the power of the Qing court, he did not dare to disobey the order. Therefore, in the dark of night, he secretly offered sacrifices and secretly ordered the relatives to flee outside, and bribed the workers to dig up the concubine's hole on the right to cover up the matter. Unexpectedly, when the coffin lid was opened, "Seeing the Sun Again" was visible, and Mr. Lü's remains were exposed! They were shocked! Could it be that Mr. Lü had foresight? Or was it preordained?</p>
<p>The Old Horse-Cart Driver (Zhou Xian)</p>
<p>I saw a statistic from Shanghai recently that claimed there were only seventeen horse-drawn carriages left in Shanghai. It's hard to imagine that the horse-drawn carriage, which once held the position of today's automobile and had its moment of glory, has declined to such an extent that it is gradually becoming qualified to be included in a museum. Mentioning this really can't help but make people feel the changes of time.</p>
<p>The landlord of the house I live in now was a horse-cart driver twenty years ago. The general impression is that a horse-cart driver is someone who wears a crooked hunting cap and tied-leg pants, and on top of that, a vest, someone of a vulgar demeanor. But my landlord is not such a person. He is now wearing the same long gown and mandarin jacket, his actions are very refined, and his speech is quite unconventional because he has given up the life of pulling reins for twenty years. He is now a small landlord in Shanghai, owning a self-built seven-up and seven-down house.</p>
<p>Although he is now a small capitalist over sixty years old, and his two sons both have very noble professions, he does not shy away from his humble origins. He himself said that he had lived a life of pulling reins for fifteen years. At that time, he had also served in a very wealthy mansion in Shanghai. There were a total of four horse-drawn carriages in that mansion, and he pulled the one that the master sat in. On average, the master only lived in Shanghai for more than two months a year.</p>
<p>Finally, he served in the house of a British taipan. The British taipan, seeing that he was very honest and diligent, changed his position to "houseboy" in the third year of pulling the reins for him, and sent his two sons to school to study. After serving in the British household for eleven years, one son entered the customs and the other entered the post office, so he retired. After retirement, he received a pension from the taipan, plus more than twenty years of savings, so he bought land and built a seven-up and seven-down house. Now he spends his days enjoying his old age with his grandchildren.</p>
<p>This old landlord lives very frugally. His daughters-in-law live with him and dare not be extravagant. Because if the daughters-in-law occasionally indulge in luxury, he would often scold them loudly, saying, "Don't you know what's good for you? You are living this kind of life now because I pulled it out with reins."</p>

<p>Menglan then stood up, poured most of a cup of cold tea from the pot on the table, and drank it all in one gulp. As Chang poured the tea, the water from the spout rushed into the cup with a soft sound. Youmei intertwined her hands, placed them in her arms, sat sideways, and only looked at the white circle on the table illuminated by the lamp, not making a sound. After Menglan finished drinking the tea, she stood up, walked forward, grasped Menglan's hands with both hands, and said very calmly: "According to what you say, you don't get comfort, you get pain. Why do you do this?" Menglan said: "Naturally, there is no comfort. But I don't feel any pain. Because I was originally in pain." Youmei said: "Does he understand your background very well?" Menglan said: "So far, my exchanges with him are only in writing. And the words that come and go, in the hands of a cautious person like me, cannot be very explicit, which is imaginable. You probably know his character better than I do. Since my letters are very polite and empty, of course, his letters cannot be substantial." Youmei said: "Does he give you many letters?" Menglan said: "How can there be many? I used to be very afraid that the letters would fall into the hands of others and cause trouble. So my brother stood up and he was willing to forward the letters. Although this is a very frank action on my brother's part, I myself feel a little ashamed." Youmei said: "Okay, now there is me, who can speak on both sides. In the future, if you have letters, just give them to me. Rain or shine, I will personally deliver them to his hands. At the same time, if he has letters for you, I will also deliver them to your hands. If there is no time to write letters, I can also report oral messages to both sides. In this way, the exchange of letters will be much safer. Do you trust me?" Menglan said: "Unless I myself am ashamed and inconvenient to bother my friends with this matter, how can I say I don't trust you?" Youmei shook his hand, looked at his face, and saw that his face was deeply flushed with two red blushes, and the range was very large, even the roots of his ears were red. The evening was cool, but his body was sweating hot. Yin Dao said: "Lan, you are too excited today when you speak, and you are sweating all over. Let's talk about it another day. We can rest." Menglan said: "Am I excited? But I feel that there are many things I want to say that I haven't said yet. But don't suspect that I still have something to hide from you, but I just feel that there are thousands of things in my mind, and I don't know which sentence to say." (98)</p>
<p>Written by the side of three copper plates of roasted sweet potatoes (Sorrow)</p>
<p>Things in Shanghai are really expensive to death. Three copper plates only bought two small roasted sweet potatoes that were "rice-sized."</p>
<p>This is precisely the season when sweet potatoes are ripe, and it is from the beautiful hometown that one runs to this ugly, ugly Shanghai.</p>
<p>Sweet potatoes, this thing, are something that the tycoons, dignitaries, young masters, and young ladies of Shanghai Beach do not have the fortune to eat. Maybe they will think that it is food for pigs. However, it (sweet potato) is not like that in the countryside along the Sheyang Lake and the Yellow River. Every "farm household" treats it as their life. Without it, eating grain for a winter and a spring becomes a problem.</p>
<p>Man, Xin, Bo, and I all love to eat sweet potatoes. Every time the sweet potatoes are ripe, we spend all day in the sweet potato fields.</p>
<p>Now, Man has been lured by vanity and has become the concubine of a low-ranking bureaucrat! Xin has also become the young lady of a "embroidered pillow" young master. Since Bo entered ×× school, she has also been infected with the habits of extravagance and lost her innocence. I have also been squeezed by life and have drifted to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The sweet potato fields in my hometown are still the same, but we who love to eat sweet potatoes have all completely changed!</p>
<p>Corrigendum</p>
<p>Yesterday, the special issue on wine above the title of this newspaper, "wine" was mistakenly written as "洒". The printer did not correct it in time, so we make a special announcement.</p>
<p>Three Great Inventions of 1936 (A Wren's Guest)</p>
<p>The rustling wind in the lush trees laments their swaying and falling, the cold light washes the distant sky, who can pull back the setting sun's spear, mixed with thousands of sorrows?</p>
<p>The above introduction commemorates Hu Maoyi, who died in the United States on October 14th, eighteen years ago.</p>
<p>The fierce energy of the nine heavens wildly fills the world, not leaving a pool to extinguish the "sunspots", one torch eventually becomes the blaze of the European war, fish in the pond suffer the fire's ravages throughout the world.</p>
<p>The above sings of sunspots. It is said: After a great war, there must be a great plague. The Paris Morning Post recently published a strange article, saying: Sunspots are volcanic holes on the sun's surface, and their power extends far to the Earth. In years of particularly large sunspots, they cause world wars and plagues.</p>
<p>Two malignant spirits rise, myriad horses gallop together, petty people rise, poisonous seedlings grow, beyond the Atlantic, in a sunken, gloomy land, every year we must not forget this sunny day.</p>
<p>The above sings of two malignant spirits. It says: The medium for the spread of the Spanish flu is one, bacteria visible to the naked eye, and two, poisonous seedlings invisible under a microscope. The two are indispensable. If cold, gloomy air accumulates on the ground without hot and cold exchange, then the two will surely rage wildly, galloping like horses, unstoppable. This is an astonishing new theory of inventors. I have heard that famous figures in the medical field of Western civilized countries are fighting the flu with all their strength, as if facing a formidable enemy, like those preventing tuberculosis and cancer. How can we not pay attention to the various descriptions of the flu because of Maoyi's death.</p>
<p>My life has limits, but "thought" is endless, a thousand trillion years, only a mound of earth, waiting to scoop water from the Milky Way, to offer chrysanthemum and maple leaves at the clear altar.</p>
<p>The above sings of the age of the Earth. According to the report of British experts examining rocks in the Great Solid State of the United States and other places, the Earth has existed for two thousand trillion years since its creation, which is also an astonishing statement. Using it in poetry is truly a new and original idea.</p>
<p>Brief Biographies - Anecdotes of World Tennis Giant Tilden (Zhi Zhi)</p>
<p>World professional tennis giant Tilden and Vines are currently touring the Far East. They first visited Japan, performing six matches for a reward of 100,000 yuan. They arrived in Shanghai on the 5th of this month and performed on the 6th. Although the weather was overcast and rainy, there were still more than 3,000 spectators, and the ticket revenue reached more than 10,000 yuan. They left Shanghai on the evening of the 6th for Hong Kong and Manila. On the 20th of this month, they will return to Shanghai for another performance before returning to the United States. In mid-December, they will rush back to the United States for MGM Pictures to produce five tennis films. These two giants in the world of tennis are unfolding the great skills of the highest level of world tennis technology before our eyes. It cannot be said that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>
<p>Tilden's original name is William T. "Big Bill" Tilden 2nd. He was born in Germantown, Pa. in the United States on February 10, 1893. He is now forty-three years old. He has dedicated his life to tennis. He started learning at the age of six, and won the children's group championship at the age of seven. When he was studying at the University of Pennsylvania at the age of eighteen, he was already one of the world-famous players. He graduated from university in 1922. Since 1920, he has quickly won the US Open tennis championship for seven years, represented the United States in the Davis Cup for eleven years, and was ranked first in the world tennis rankings for ten years. In 1920, 1922, and 1930, he won the Wimbledon Championship. The last time he won, he was thirty-eight years old. In the same year, he left amateur life and joined the professional tennis world.</p>
<p>Tilden's success in life is entirely due to his perseverance, constant research, calm judgment during battles, courage, and wisdom, all of which are essential to his success. In the 1922s, a poisonous sore suddenly grew on his right middle finger, and the upper half of his middle finger was finally cut off. He thought he would have to give up his tennis life from now on, but he continued to work hard and it did not affect his skills. Because of his subsequent efforts, he became the number one tennis player in the world.</p>
<p>Because he is committed to the tennis industry, he has forged an indissoluble bond with tennis throughout his life. He has not married yet, nor does he want to marry. In the prosperous and confusing environment of New York, he is not stained by the mud. Women and wine cannot get close to him. He only occasionally smokes cigarettes, but he does not smoke within a few hours before and after the game. In addition to concentrating on court strategy, he is also a writer. His writing is very fluent. He has written more than a dozen tennis books, all of which are very wonderful and popular all over the world. There are translations in various countries, which will be passed down forever and benefit young people who come later. His contribution is not insignificant. Although he is a great championship player, he is also very interested in drama. Because of his naive nature, he is a famous stage clown. At the same time, he can also write scripts and has served as a stage supervisor. Undoubtedly, he is also a playwright. When performing tennis, he often tries his best to display his humorous and funny clown art to entertain the audience.</p>
<p>His personality is straightforward and unyielding. He does not like to flatter people. If the referee makes a mistake during the game, regardless of which side the error affects, he will immediately correct it. He is the same when criticizing a tennis player. He also said that the British tennis player Pan Lai, who has won the world championship for three consecutive years (Pan also formally joined the professional tennis world by receiving Tilden's professional tennis company contract in the middle of this month), does not have very good skills. Pan Lai did not succeed, so he said. Now that Pan Lai has succeeded, he still says so and will never change his consistent position. But for Kramm of Germany, he has always praised him.</p>
<p>The optimism of the people of the Golden State has created the special development of professional sports. Any amateur athlete with a skill, when it is enough to attract the audience, no one does not think of going to the United States. Recently, such as Pan Lai of Yingguo, has also officially signed the contract and decided to go to the United States in January next year to compete with Vines. It is said that the reward for this final match is 25,000 US dollars, and it is guaranteed that Pan will receive 100,000 gold in revenue within a year. No wonder Tifan, who used to live an ordinary life, have now become Wengs.</p>

After the start of the game, Chizhi's Su Yinghai scored three consecutive goals, and Liang Yunming, Chen Xuechong, and Zhan Tingrui added to the score, leading 11-1, giving Xinan a great threat. Jinan saw that the situation was not good, so they transferred fresh troops Huang Zhaolin and Han Zhenyuan to help, and their spirit increased sharply.

After the break, Jinan's Huang Zhaolin made a long shot, and Han Zhenyuan and Yong Yaoya made contributions one after another, surpassing 26-20.

<p>An Appeal for the Health of Children in Rural Township Elementary Schools Across the Country (Part 1) by Xie Yuheng</p>
<p>I. Current Rural Township Health and Rural Township Elementary School Children</p>
<p>China's recent rural revitalization movement can be considered a vigorous upsurge that once flourished. Rural township health facilities emerged in response. However, due to the failure to recognize a far-reaching, enduring, universal, and fundamental significance in the mission of the rural revitalization movement, the development of rural health has been wavering in the midst of thunder, wind, and rain. Generally, hygiene work in the rural movement can be categorized into two types. One is relief-oriented, where hygiene work is mixed with charitable endeavors, merely involving diagnosis and medication, completely losing the essence of rural hygiene. The other is demonstrative, where hygiene work is relatively comprehensive but still carries the color of the former. Although China lost the four northeastern provinces, the number of rural areas remaining is still substantial. If hygiene work remains relief-oriented or demonstrative, it lacks universality and long-term significance.</p>
<p>According to the "Survey Table of General Conditions of Rural Health in China" in Li's book "Problems of Rural Health in China," in such a vast country, only seventeen places are running rural health programs: one established by the central government, two by counties or cities, eight jointly by counties/cities and the central government or private organizations, and six by private organizations or schools. The total number of staff is only one hundred and eighty-seven. The current state of rural health can be seen from this. Among these, only a few places such as the Plain Teaching Society Experimental Zone in Ding County delve into rural areas to handle rural health and care for the health of rural township elementary school children. Although county hospitals are listed within the rural scope, their work is limited to the county's urban area. How many of the farmers who toil year-round, living in hardship and poverty, benefit from them? How much protection do the health of elementary school children in townships receive? The relationship between China's rural township health and the health of rural township elementary school children is clear today!</p>
<p>II. The Unhealthy Condition of Rural Township Elementary School Students</p>
<p>Since the First Health Office in Beiping advocated for school health in 1925, cities that are more prosperous have intermittently established school health programs. However, the number is still limited. In 1934, the Department of Health collected statistics on physical examinations from various places. Those with defects accounted for more than 95%, including 10% suffering from malnutrition, 30% from skin diseases, 50% from eye diseases, 40% from dental diseases, and 25% from tonsil diseases. In addition, the number of those suffering from other diseases was also considerable. The Department of Health also collaborated with the Ministry of Education to examine the physical condition of over 20,000 students in specialized fields and above, among whom more than 7,000 had diseases, with one-third suffering from chronic infectious diseases. From these two statistics, it is evident that the physical condition of students in China is so unsound that it undoubtedly affects the health of the entire nation! Students in cities have a better life, and the environment provides a lot of health benefits due to material civilization, yet their physical condition is still so unsound. Moreover, the family circumstances of students in specialized fields and above are much better than the average person, yet their physical condition is also unhealthy.</p>
<p>Imagine the extent to which the physical condition of rural children, living in the four major ailments of poverty, ignorance, disease, and selfishness, must be compromised. If there are a few experts who genuinely care about the health of rural children, or a local administrative official, who can personally and practically take a trip to the countryside (the county seat is not the countryside), they can see many children with sores, eye problems, limping feet, mumps, festering hands and feet, ringworm, runny noses, pockmarked faces, bone tuberculosis, and other diseases. If defects are examined, there could be 100% statistical deviation. No one guarantees their health, and no one treats their diseases. Compared to children in cities, the difference is as vast as heaven and earth. At that time, there would be no need to appeal for their health problems. Experts or administrative officials would surely feel pity. Children in rural townships are ardently hoping that experts and administrative officials will take measures to protect their health out of compassion.</p>
<p>III. The Importance of Rural Township Children's Health</p>
<p>China is an agricultural country, with rural land accounting for over 95% and farmers accounting for over 85%. The foundation of the country, the strength of the country, and the economy of the country are entirely built on the entire rural area. At a time when national difficulties are severe and crises are lurking, the movement to revitalize rural areas is an urgent need. No matter how serious the national difficulties are, we must consistently obey the government's response policies externally and work harder on rural construction internally, diagnose and treat the poverty, ignorance, weakness, and selfishness in rural areas, and prepare to support the country in times of crisis. Mr. Yan Yangchu said in the mission of the rural movement: "Today, the main goal of the rural movement should especially focus on rural youths. These youths can not only be good successors but also excellent future workers. They can also be a fresh force to save China and a vanguard to transform China. Taking Ding County as an example, out of the 400,000 people in the county, 80,000 are young farmers. Considering China's 400 million people, the number of rural youths in China should be at least 80 million. In the past, Xiang Yu destroyed the Qin and revived the Chu with only 8,000 soldiers. If China concentrates its efforts to transform these 80 million young farmers, I believe no national difficulty can stand up to us, and no national humiliation cannot be wiped away. Only then will all construction have a stable foundation and a solid base." Today's rural youth are so important. If we want a strong country, then we should actively provide good education to the future young farmers—rural township children—so that they can continue to work hard on national construction and revive China's authority. Therefore, today's children in rural townships have the responsibility to catch up quickly and continue to strive for China's rejuvenation, which is not only something that urban children can accomplish in the future. In today's China, how many places are working hard on this? The current young farmers have not been able to be transformed, and the future young farmers have not been given appropriate education. If this continues, who will we rely on for rural revitalization, national construction, coping with national crises, and supporting the country in times of crisis? Now, in addition to actively transforming young farmers, we must also provide good education to future young farmers. Furthermore, historically, many heroes and great men who have achieved great success have been "country folks" who came from the fields. From these two points, we can see the importance of educating children in rural townships, especially given the current poor physical condition and prevalence of diseases among rural children. Currently, in terms of education for rural children, although there is free education, it is still not widespread. Who is paying attention to their well-being? If there are knowledgeable farmers but no healthy farmers, how can the country be strong? The importance of the health of children in rural townships is undeniable.</p>
<h3 id="e156">An Overview of the Work of the Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association in the Past Three Years and Future Plans by Yan Fuqing <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>This association was initiated by Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, who connected leaders from various Chinese and foreign circles and giants in the medical field. The inaugural meeting was held on October 21, 1933, at the Municipal Government Reception Office on Avenue Joffre. Wu Tiecheng was elected as honorary president, Niu Huisheng as chairman, Li Ting'an as vice-chairman, and Yan Fuqing, Weng Zhilong, and Bu Mei as executive directors. In 1934, Niu Huisheng requested leave due to illness, and the position of chairman was temporarily filled by Vice-Chairman Li Ting'an according to the law. In 1935, Chairman Niu Huisheng repeatedly requested resignation, which was approved at the fifth executive director meeting in mid-September of that year. Lu Bohong was elected as chairman. In October 1936, when the annual meeting was held, directors and supervisors were re-elected in accordance with the regulations. As a result, Wu Tiecheng, Lu Bohong, Li Ting'an, Yan Fuqing, Huang Zifang, Weng Zhilong, Qiao Deng, Shi Siming, Chen Heqin, Pan Gongzhan, Gan Xiaoying, and other eleven people were elected as executive directors. Du Yuesheng, Pang Jingzhou, Ding Fubao, Qian Xinzhi, Yao Mulian, Yu Qiaqing, Liu Zhanen, and other seven people were regularly elected as supervisors. The overview of the work in the past three years is described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Soliciting Members—Anti-tuberculosis work cannot be done by the efforts of one or two individuals or one or two organizations alone. It requires the joint participation of people from all walks of life to be effective. Therefore, after its establishment, the association immediately solicited members and raised funds to strengthen its power. Subsequently, it held a fundraising conference every year. The first fundraising conference was opened on December 15, 1934, at the Banking Association on Hong Kong Road, raising 300 members and donations of more than 18,000 yuan. The opening ceremony of the second fundraising conference was held on April 6, 1935, at Mayor Wu's residence, raising 800 members and donations of more than 7,300 yuan. The third fundraising conference was held at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA on April 18 of this year. From the date of establishment to June 25 of this year, a total of 35,828.39 yuan was collected in membership fees, donations, X-ray fees, and bank interest.</p>
<p>(2) Publicity—At the beginning of its establishment, in addition to striving to carry out various practical tasks, the association also paid attention to publicity matters to awaken the nation's attention to the anti-tuberculosis movement and instill preventive methods and treatment knowledge. Publicity matters can be divided into two aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Oral Publicity—(1) Holding popular lectures at various schools, organizations, and public places, totaling 40 sessions and reaching 25,000 people. (2) Radio Lectures—Broadcasting lectures on various radio stations, totaling 20 sessions. (3) Conducting a campaign to discourage spitting—One session each last year and this year, with 14 lectures and 7,000 listeners, and distributing 15,000 copies of special publications and leaflets on the campaign to discourage spitting.</p>
<p>(2) Written Publicity: (1) Publishing anti-tuberculosis monthly magazines and health pictorials (bi-weekly), which are edited and issued by the association on a regular basis, with a total distribution of more than 100,000 copies. (2) Posting various slogans—Mobile advertisements on streetcars and buses, as well as wall advertisements in important places on the road, totaling 15,000 copies. (3) Holding anti-tuberculosis exhibitions—In January 1935, an anti-tuberculosis exhibition was held at the YMCA on Sichuan Road, lasting for three days and attracting more than 3,000 visitors. (4) Compiling anti-tuberculosis health posters—A total of 40 types, each printed in 1,000 copies, distributed to various schools, organizations, and institutions for posting. (5) Donating anti-tuberculosis books—"Guide to Lung Disease," "Prevention of Lung Disease," and "Treatment of Lung Disease," totaling more than 3,000 copies. (6) Composing five types of anti-tuberculosis songs—Distributed to various schools, organizations, and singing groups, totaling 3,500 copies.</p>
<p>(3) Establishing Clinics—In order to meet social needs and prevent the spread of tuberculosis, the association established the First Clinic on West Lin Road, West Gate, on June 14, 1934. On April 1, 1935, the Second Clinic was added on Duojia Road, South City. On January 7, 1936, the Third Clinic was added on Tibet Road. However, the Second and Third Clinics have been relocated due to contractual issues with the location. The Second Clinic is now located in the Qingyun Road Health Office. The Third Clinic has been temporarily suspended due to a shortage of manpower. All clinics provide free medical treatment to patients. Since the establishment of the clinics, more than 5,000 citizens have visited for treatment, which proves the prevalence of tuberculosis among the citizens.</p>
<p>In addition, there are home visits. Nurses from the clinics visit patients' homes every morning to inform them of various methods of prevention and treatment, so that patients can learn how to maintain their health and avoid infecting their families.</p>
<p>In addition to treating tuberculosis patients, the association's clinics also</p>
<p>Page 16</p>
<p>conduct tuberculin tests for elementary school students, totaling 385 children. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>In addition, National Jiaotong University, Shanghai Business School, and Shanghai University have entrusted the association's clinics to use X-ray machines to fluoroscope the lungs of new students to conduct physical examinations upon admission. The anti-tuberculosis work has attracted the attention of various schools, which is deeply gratifying. In total, more than 300 new university students have had their lungs examined by X-ray.</p>
<p>(4) Holding Summer Children's Health Camps—In June 1934, the association co-sponsored the first Shanghai Summer Children's Health Camp with the Municipal Education Bureau, Health Bureau, Children's Welfare Association, Chenbao Newspaper, and other organizations. The camp was held at Tongji Middle School in Wusong, with a total of 60 boys and girls enrolled, with good results. In June 1935, the second Summer Children's Health Camp was held, with the number of children enrolled reaching 180. In June of this year, the third Summer Children's Health Camp was held, with more than 20 participating groups and the number of children enrolled soaring to 220, which is an important endeavor to promote outdoor activities for children.</p>
<p>(5) Publishing Anti-Tuberculosis Magazines—In order to popularize anti-tuberculosis education, after several preparations, the anti-tuberculosis monthly magazine was launched in November 1934. Since its publication, it has been well-received by all sectors of society. In June of this year, it was changed to Health Pictorial (bi-weekly). The education sector in various places is very interested in the publication, considering it a good supplementary reading material for health education.</p>
<p>(6) Conducting a Campaign to Discourage Spitting—Spitting everywhere easily spreads tuberculosis bacteria, no different from setting up a machine gun on the road. The Chinese people are deeply rooted in this bad habit, and it is impossible to eradicate it with just a few days of publicity. Therefore, the association decided to hold large-scale publicity once every March and April to awaken the nation and eradicate the bad habit of spitting everywhere. The publicity in the past two years has attracted the attention of the general public! It is gratifying.</p>
<p>(7) Participating in Health Campaigns—The association has participated in the annual Shanghai Municipal Health Campaign since its establishment, taking on the anti-tuberculosis movement in the conference. In addition to expanding publicity to make the public aware of the severity of tuberculosis and the methods of prevention and treatment, each session also sends letters to various hospitals and doctors to provide free physical examinations and half-price X-rays for soldiers. In addition, it participated in the Zhenjiang Health Education Exhibition this year and received a certificate of merit.</p>
<p>(8) Holding Anti-Tuberculosis Exhibitions—We recognize that tuberculosis has many types and complex symptoms, making it difficult for the general public to understand and prevent. Therefore, on October 3, 1935, we held an anti-tuberculosis exhibition at the Sichuan Road YMCA. With the assistance of municipal organizations and medical groups, it went very smoothly. The exhibits included tuberculosis models, charts, statistical cartoons, slogans, and more than 1,000 items. It is estimated that 500 to 600 people attended that day. The audience was able to generally understand the types of tuberculosis, the symptoms of each stage, and the methods of prevention and treatment, leaving a deep impression. (To be continued)</p>

<p>(97) Lymphatic Constitution and Exudative Diathesis</p>
<p>(Question) What is called a lymphatic constitution?</p>
<p>(Answer) This is a type of abnormal constitution. Children often have chronic swelling of the lymph nodes, and their skin and mucous membranes are prone to pathological changes. Later, they are also prone to bone and joint lesions, which is called a child with a lymphatic constitution.</p>
<p>(Question) How is the word "constitution" explained?</p>
<p>(Answer) This is a commonly used term, which refers to the inherent strength of the human body to suffer from certain types of diseases. In a broad sense, diabetes, obesity, bronchial asthma, hemophilia, neuralgia, etc., can all be attributed to abnormal constitutions.</p>
<p>(Question) What does a person with a lymphatic constitution look like?</p>
<p>(Answer) They are mostly pale, with withered skin, relaxed muscles, and a swollen face, and thick and protruding lips; this is called a sluggish lymphatic constitution. There are also those with flushed skin and veins visible under the skin, which is called a sensitive lymphatic constitution.</p>
<p>(Question) Do people with a lymphatic constitution have changes in the lymph nodes?</p>
<p>(Answer) Yes. People with this constitution have painless swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck, mandible angle, and nape of the neck (commonly known as phlegm nodes).</p>
<p>(Question) What are the changes in the skin?</p>
<p>(Answer) Children with this constitution are most prone to eczema, lupus, or pruritic lichen, etc.</p>

<p>"Medicinal Use" Old sayings: Vitex fruit is effective for colds and is used as a decoction. Vitex Succus is an expectorant. The daily dose is 4-12 cm.</p>
<p>II. Vitex trifolia, L. var. Ovata, Makino</p>
<p>"Plant" It mostly grows on sandy beaches by the sea and is a deciduous small shrub. The trunk is recumbent. The leaves have stalks, are oval, entire, round-headed, and densely covered with white hair on the reverse side. Terminal cymes, blooming small purple labiate flowers in summer.

<p>(IV) How good the rules are, the results depend entirely on human actions—Now, please discuss lawyers and doctors together for easy understanding. Lawyers use knowledge and skills to protect human rights within the scope of the law, and doctors use knowledge and skills to protect human lives within the scope of the law. Therefore, the two are regarded as liberal professions, are valued by society, and have legal protection for their powers. Lawyers deal with cases, and human and material evidence sometimes requires detailed scientific examination and citation. Not only must every word be based on evidence and be reasonable, but it must also comply with the law. Doctors treat diseases, and observation, auscultation, questioning, and palpation are superficial matters. Not only must there be subjective judgment, but also objective examinations to prove without doubt before diagnosis and treatment. This is scientific medicine, which is in line with the scientific rules. Those who manipulate words and use eloquent tongues to reverse black and white, distorting the truth for self-interest, are called tricksters and are not lawyers. Those who make alarming statements, talk nonsense, deceive the world, do not follow the law, do not abide by the standards of science, and only know self-interest without prioritizing the interests of patients are called quacks and are not doctors.</p>
<p>Returning to the topic, in short, blood transfusion is performed to save lives. A corresponding surgery fee is charged, and the blood recipient gives the blood donor a reward, without taking any commission. When the extremely poor need blood transfusion, they also try their best to arrange it. Voluntary blood donors are prepared in advance, and hospital nurses and workers nearby are selected to serve. Such doctors are the same as fair and wise lawyers who are willing to speak up for justice. Those who perform surgery for the sake of surgery fees, regardless of whether the patient needs it or not, and those who transfuse blood for the sake of blood transfusion rewards are no different from pimps who buy rural women for financial exploitation. If there is such a person and if there are co-authors, I will write to condemn him and file a lawsuit to sue him. I will gladly hold the whip for them. However, I will never agree with the argument of giving up eating because of choking.</p>
<p>In response, Yu Ran Shen Tong firmly and loudly shouted, "We should cherish blood and not kill it invisibly, nor sacrifice it meaninglessly. We should not value blood, but see how it is used! The great rivers and mountains are filled with smoke and miasma. If we don't use our blood, how can we wash it clean?! How can the nation prosper?! The principle is the same as the blood transfusion law." (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e160">Shen Bao's Local Supplement Calls for an "Aid Suiyuan Movement" by Wen <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Suiyuan, the frontline of national defense, has been the target of enemy attacks and conspiracies for a year, and today it has finally erupted. We remember the official statement of the past Second Plenary Session and the statement of Chairman Chiang, resolutely not to lose an inch of land, and resolutely to give a painful blow to the enemy's further invasion. This is the oath of our government to the people, and we support this strong oath with ten thousand points of enthusiasm. Today, we ask the patriotic people of the whole country to use unanimous enthusiasm to promote the practice of this oath. Today, the enemy has begun to invade our country's territory again with force, and we ask the government to immediately lead the people to combine the strength of the whole people with a firm will to resist the enemy, and give the enemy's attack a courageous counterattack.</p>
<p>On the 15th, this newspaper published a letter from Luo Jialun, the president of Central University, expressing condolences to the soldiers of Suiyuan and donating 1,000 yuan for medical expenses. It also said: "The mountains and rivers dyed with our blood must always belong to us. The survival and honor of the nation can only be maintained by the heads and blood of our own nation! I believe that you, soldiers, have recognized the wonders of our nation's revival in the fortress of withered grass and yellow sand, waiting to bloom. I firmly believe that you will soon make the world recognize that the Chinese men are still lions, not sheep! The blood of our compatriots all over the country is willing to rush to the trenches outside the Great Wall to help you reduce the cold and inspire loyalty, courage, and indignation... Now, the fate of the entire nation is in our hands, and we all have nowhere to escape between heaven and earth! Only the mountains and rivers dyed with our blood are more worthy of our and future generations' praise and love!" This is the unanimous call of our people across the country. We express our support for Mr. Luo's powerful statement with twelve thousand points of enthusiasm.</p>
<p>It is also reported that people from all walks of life in Peiping and Tianjin have launched the "Aid Suiyuan" movement one after another. All the workers of the Hsieh Ho University even fasted for one day to donate their meals for the day to aid the Suiyuan army. Suiyuan is the frontline of our country's national defense today, and Suiyuan is the land shared by all our people. Therefore, the "Aid Suiyuan" movement should not be limited to Peiping and Tianjin. Throughout the country, especially in Shanghai, the economic and cultural center, an "Aid Suiyuan Movement" should be launched immediately. In the past, we have seen the enthusiasm of all walks of life in purchasing aircraft for Chairman Chiang's 50th birthday. Today, in the Aid Suiyuan Movement, we hope to see the same enthusiastic and lasting movement spread throughout the country. We hope that an organization to receive donations will be established immediately in Shanghai to launch the Aid Suiyuan Movement extensively. The government will definitely cherish this sincere "Aid Suiyuan" movement.</p>
<p>In terms of diplomacy, the "friendly nations" have made it clear that the Suiyuan bandit incident has nothing to do with them. Then this matter belongs entirely to our internal affairs, and our government has the right to suppress the bandits who are causing chaos in our country with any force. At this time, there is absolutely no question of any involvement in diplomacy or international friendship, so we can carry out the "Aid Suiyuan" movement without any scruples, which will not hinder the government's diplomatic negotiations. Moreover, the enemy will see how great the strength of our people is, and will only know how to be more cautious, which will be beneficial to diplomacy.</p>
<p>Shanghai, which is located in the economic and cultural center of the country, should immediately launch this Aid Suiyuan Movement to set an example for the whole country. Furthermore, it is reported that enemy aircraft have appeared in the Pingdiquan area. We further request that the many aircraft previously presented to the government by the people should be immediately sent to Suiyuan, as this is the time to use them. We can also launch a second, or even countless, aircraft presentation movement to provide the government with an unlimited supply for use in resisting the enemy.</p>

<p>Ascites is considered a terminal illness by Chinese doctors, and Western medicine has no cure. The only option is to open it with a knife and needle, but it will soon swell up again. Therefore, it is difficult to cure one out of ten patients. Since the Shanghai Zhengwei Pharmacy (opposite the Grand Theatre at the intersection of Yinghua Street, Er Ma Road) invented "Worry-Free Pills for Ascites," it has saved many lives for more than ten years. All those suffering from water ascites, gas ascites, women's blood ascites, and children's malnutrition and bloating, etc., have been cured after taking this pill. Therefore, the national medical community recognizes it as a groundbreaking and miraculous medicine, and they are happy to recommend it. The efficacy of this pill is both great and fast. Those with mild symptoms can recover by taking two boxes. Those with severe symptoms will be cured with four boxes. The fixed price is five yuan per box. The instructions will be sent immediately upon request.</p>
<h3 id="e163">"Are the Words of a Dying Man Good?" by Yin Fei <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>"The words of a dying man are good." This is an old saying. According to Chinese custom, anything that is qualified to be called "old" becomes an iron law that cannot be denied. Usually, probably because of fear of being a traitor, it seems that few people dare to say a "no" to this iron law.</p>
<p>But are the words of a dying man really "good"? I think it's not necessarily true, at least it's not necessarily all good.</p>
<p>When a prisoner is about to be executed, there is always a pastor to pray for him, asking God to elevate him, but there is also a condition attached, that is, the prisoner must confess his sins during his lifetime. It seems that after such a confession, the sinful soul immediately becomes holy and can go to heaven.</p>
<p>In such a situation, the stubborn prisoner is stubborn to the end, not only refusing to confess, but also shouting "In twenty years, I will be a good man again!" Because of this, it is common for pastors to be at a loss. Such prisoners are generally given an epithet by those who are responsible for teaching and persuading them, saying: "He does not wake up until death." Whether he "does not wake up until death" is not to be discussed here for the time being, but it is more than enough to prove that "the words of a dying man" are not necessarily all "good."</p>
<p>There are not many prisoners who "do not wake up until death"; most prisoners turn pale or even sob when they hear the news of their execution. At this time, the religious force takes the opportunity to enter, and naturally becomes a painkiller for those waiting to be slaughtered. Naturally, he will do it without error; but is this the "good" of "dying"? I'm afraid it's not necessarily true. To put it bluntly, most of them think that they have committed a "crime." In this way, they can get rid of some "crime," so that they can suffer less "torture" when they arrive at "hell." It's good that this is just a matter of lifting a hand, so why not do it. Therefore, the motivation is still to get rid of sin, not to do good. As for the pastors, even they themselves do not know whether they will go to heaven after confession, but it is naturally more willing to let living people say a word of mercy and absorb some followers, which is good for him.</p>
<p>"Warped" prisoners "their words are not good" are originally incomprehensible, but are those who are not "warped" "good"? It's not necessarily!</p>
<p>Those who can "die in their sleep" and are not dying of a sudden illness usually have some "last words" when they are "dying." For ordinary people, it is always about owing debts to others and raising the old and caring for the young; as for celebrities or prominent officials, it is naturally different. In addition to how to dispose of the estate, they must add a few clauses such as "do not do this" and "do not do that" to show that even when they are sick, they have not forgotten national affairs and morality.</p>
<p>It may be a fact that they still remember national affairs while lying in bed, but concern is not necessarily "good." To put it absolutely, it can sometimes even be "evil": If you want to be a marquis who steals the country, you must not be indifferent to national affairs, this is one thing; second, even if you want to do good wholeheartedly, but because of the limitations of his environment and the spirit of the times, the result is that he regards arsenic as a good medicine to save the world, so he poisons people and still rejoices in his concern for the world and national affairs.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if his motivation is good, "his words" may not necessarily be "good." As for whether the motivation is pure, there are many places that are also beyond doubt. To put it bluntly, celebrities and prominent officials are weakened by illness and have neurasthenia. Because they have killed too many people when they are on stage, the fear of crime is sometimes even greater than that of prisoners: those who say "do not do this" and "do not do that" are sometimes a reflection of the psychology of getting rid of sin.</p>
<p>However, will "the words of a dying man" not have "their words are good"? Not necessarily. However, "their words are good" must be those who are usually "good" in what they "say" and do, then they will be "good in their words," but that is already different from the meaning of "the dying man."</p>
<p>It is impossible to do all kinds of evil in ordinary times, and then "their words are good" when "the dying man."</p>

<p>Across from the window is a dilapidated small foreign house. The ochre-red roof tiles have been weathered into a dim gray: the creeper grows as much as possible, almost sealing off a louvered window. In the cold wind of late autumn, the "for rent" wooden sign seems to be hitting the iron fence gate like a wind chime on the top of a tower.</p>
<p>Every day I sit at my desk reading and writing. When I hear the turbid gold sound of the for rent wooden sign hitting the iron fence post, I always stare blankly at the louvered window, wondering where the owner of this small foreign house is wandering now? Sometimes I fantasize that in the middle of the night when thunder and lightning are intertwined, the louvered window suddenly breaks the tough stems and leaves of the creeper and opens wide. A young woman with disheveled hair stands in front of the window, with two glowing eyes, flying down from the window and kneeling on the herringbone-shaped pavement, worshiping the sky and telling how she was wronged to death. Then I immediately close the window and draw the thick velvet curtains. I am afraid that I will really encounter such a female zombie.</p>

<p>Remaining Thieves Rescheduled for Further Interrogation</p>
<p>The home of Zhuang Zhiyang (comprador of Tongmao Foreign Firm at 9 Sanma Road), a native of Wuxi, at No. 16, Tongde Lane, No. 223 Avenue Foch, French Concession, was suddenly broken into by bandits at about 6:00 PM on the 14th. After the robbery, the bandits fled with the loot. The French police received the report and immediately dispatched a large number of detectives in patrol cars to pursue them. Because the bandits opened fire to resist arrest, the detectives also opened fire in return. As a result, Gu Rongsheng, Wang Rongsheng, and Yang Shilin, three thieves, were injured and fell to the ground and were captured. They were sent to Guangci Hospital by the police for treatment. Another thief, named Wang Anqing, was injured and fled at the time. He was accompanied by his fellow villager Zhao Mingqi to the Labor Hospital on Xiaoshadu Road for treatment. The hospital reported the case to the police as usual and detained Gu. It was found that Wang was related to the robbery case on Avenue Foch, and the French police were notified to send Wang to Guangci Hospital. Zhao was brought back to the French police station. Yesterday morning, Zhao was first escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Special Second Court. The presiding judge, Wang Gangxu, interrogated him, and the police chief, Fei Xizhen, explained the case, stating that the defendant was a member of the robbery gang in Tongde Lane, Avenue Foch. Some bandits were injured in resisting arrest and are now being treated in the hospital. He requested a postponement until the injured thieves recovered and the investigation was completed before filing a lawsuit for trial. Zhao confessed that he did not know about the robbery. Wang Anqing asked me to accompany him to the hospital. The court verified the confession and decided to reschedule the interrogation for 2:00 PM on the 27th. Yang Shilin, one of the four injured thieves, 43 years old, a native of Haimen, died at 2:40 PM yesterday due to a gunshot wound to a vital part of the abdomen, right next to the navel. The hospital notified the police, and the body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan sub-hall for an autopsy, and a report will be submitted to the Special First Court today to send someone to examine it.</p>
