<p>時評</p>
<h3>日蘇不侵犯條約果能實現麽</h3>
<p>— 隅</p>
<p>現在日俄的外交還沒有到淸算時期雖則日本有田外相在閣護席上解釋日本已定的外交政策其重心是在對俄等到日俄邊境雙方軍隊能逸到平衡程度卽當努力於締結互不侵犯條約及設立非武裝區域然而就事實看來有田外相的漂亮的論調亦不過和過去廣田任外相時代所標榜的「萬邦協和」政策一樣乃是一個不兌現的調言不侵犯條約本為蘇聯一貫的外交政策過去蘇聯曾把這樣的主張一再向東京方面提出可是日本的三宅坂的首腦拒之於前而霞關的首腦遂亦不得不尾隨於後而加之以拒絕以征赤的幌子掩護它在亞洲大陸的侵略行動一方面增兵華北侵略察東最近復有在背後策動偽軍李守信部進占綏東的企圖一方面則挑動偽軍向外蒙進攻徒以外蒙早為準備它的侵略計劃也就不能如願實現可是它的控制華北內蒙向蘇俄作大包圍的野心並沒有從那些以流血為唯一職志以侵略為唯一目的的武人腦中消逝在這樣情形之下蘇俄為防止侵略自必有强化遠東軍事的必要但我們要知道蘇俄强化的遠東軍事的準備是防守的而非侵略的同時蘇聯當局仍無時不願與日本締結不侵犯條的由最近日本駐俄大使太田回國對新聞記者的談話謂寺蘇聯對四年前所提議的互不侵犯條約案至今尙未斷念無論何時有再提出之意」這樣的論調出之於一個日本外交官之口那末日俄雙方在遠東軍備競爭而使兩國相互關係惡化其關鍵所在我們不加思索而就可明白了</p>
<p>因此我們不相信日本外交政策是所謂維持遠東和平而有田這次表示和平的姿態也不過是有些政論家所指出的感覺國防費用負擔過巨因維持過量的海陸軍而乏確定的外交政策實屬毫無意義於是有對英恊調的呼聲於是有對俄提出不侵犯條約的主張這種姿態的表現與其說是對外的無寗說是對內的換言之卽政客與軍部對於國防費膨脹的觀點有所不同而並非外交政策有所改變也看了軍部方面提出了國防第一的政策看了軍事總動員的計劃我們就可知道所謂與他國增進邦交覓取合作基礎都不過是一種表面文章而已</p>

<h3>日本旅行記（十）（四）</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　胡仲持　胡一臧</p>
<p>（九）鹿和大佛</p>
<p>我們在大阪住了三宿，便到大阪京都之間一個著名的遊覽都市奈良去。</p>
<p>早上八點半，我們在大阪車站上了電車，坐到天王寺便換乘火車。這班車是慢車，三等里坐滿了人，可是二等車廂裏卻連我們不過四個人。車上的設備，二等和三等沒有多大的分別。座椅一律用綠絨綳成，二等藍色，三等綠色，座椅中間沒有桌子，不過二等的椅背可以隨意轉向罷了。我們坐着的列車過丁百濟，平野兩站，便出大阪市，在田園風景中間走。再過了幾站，從車窗望得見信貴山和許多葡萄園。於是穿過了黑魆魆的芝山隧道，渡過了龍田川的小鐵橋。不多久就釗奈良車站了</p>
<p>車站前一條馬路上開着幾家純日本式的旅館，有一家在門口擺着一個相當大的老人騎鹿的本刻像，這牽惹了我們的視綫，我們便走進那家旅館去。「女中」引導了我們上樓。我們在八張席子的一個房間裏休息了一會，吃了一頓飯。有一個日本女子提着木製的疊盒，走到房間門口來。她跪着把疊盒裏的東西，一件件拿給我們看，中有印着風景的小手帕，鹿角做的香烟嘴，以及各種小玩具，如鉛澆的神鹿，銅　的佛頭之類。她說：「這是奈良本地的特產，請先生們買些兒。」我們隨便揀了幾件買下來，於是那女子道了謝去了。</p>
<p>整一個下午，我們遊着奈良公園。</p>
<p>這公園區域佔有奈良全市面積的四分之一，名勝古蹟很多。一切的自然風景都引得起輕快爽適的心情來。草地上散走着許多大大小小的鹿，對遊客們似乎非常的親切。只要把飼鹿餅拿在手裏，左近的鹿就攢集到身邊來。</p>
<p>我們在奈良公園遊覽了興福寺，帝室博物館，東大寺，奪日神社和萬葉植物園這幾個地方。</p>
<p>興福寺是八世紀所創立，而在十五世紀重建的。全部房屋的木料都沒有油漆過。寺門和殿門的上端，並排地高掛着好些木板，本板上貼有滿是漢字的白紙，有的是到那裏參詣過的小學生們手寫的。我們一向看慣了金漆輝煌的區額，在那裏不禁感覺到非常純樸的情味。寺裏有一座五重塔，據說是日本的第二高塔。塔影倒映在左近的猿澤池裏，那邊蕃有好些鯉魚和烏龜，時刻在水面躍動着。</p>
<p>五重塔前石燈籠的基石，據說還是八世紀日本天平時代的遺物。寺裏有幾尊銅鑄和木刻的佛像則是數百年前重建寺屋時候所遺留的可也保存着天平時代藝術的遺風。這一切連同與福寺的全都建築，都經日政府指定為國寳，保護得非常周到。日本人對於古代藝術的愛護精神眞値得贊佩。可惜有的一到我國的境內，不免改變了心理。我們屢决聽得日本人因為我國海關禁止古物出口的緣故，設法把雲岡等處的石佛斫了頭斬了臂偷運出去。如果日本人的提倡尊孔並不騙人，那麼希望他們記取孔子的一句老話『已所不欲，弗施於人。』</p>
<p>帝室博物館是一所白色的單層洋樓。我們買了門票進去。這裏面陳列着的美術品，大半是奈良縣古社寺所寄託的。陳列室分做十三室。第一第二第三這三室陳列着彫刻，從第四到第八這五室陳列着佛具，武器，甲胄及其他美術工藝品，從九室到第十二室所陳列的繪畫居多。第十三室則陳列着伎樂而古文書等。幾種主要的陳列品上附有群細的說明紙片。日本飛鳥，白鳳，天平，藤原，鐮倉各期的繪晝彫刻在那裏都找得出代表的傑作來。我們在參觀時候，見到一個戴着破舊的黑呢帽的晝家在一尊木刻的古佛像前，聚精會神地臨摹着古佛像的一隻手。就此可知這一類的博物館對於日本美術的發展是有不少的帮助的。</p>
<p>在公園裏最使我們感到濃厚的興味的要算日本第一大佛所在的東大寺了。這是一千二百年前日本聚武天皇所創立，經過幾决重建的大寺。宏壯的寺門兩旁豎着金剛力士木造像，出於鐮倉時代大彫刻家運慶和湛慶的妙手，門內兩隻石獅子相傳是宋代從中國東渡的著名石工陳和卿所造的。我們從大門沿着參道進去。在木闌干旁邊買了大佛拜觀籤，便走到大佛殿。這個木造的佛殿的宏大，在日本人誇稱為世界第一。這重建於一七〇九年，採取着從中國傳入的天竺的建築式樣。殿中銅鑄的廬舍那大佛的坐像，高十六公尺以上，臉長五公尺光景，眼長一公尺二光景望去的確是驚人的。日本人說這是全世界最大的銅像，大的不會錯吧。這大佛據說是日本聖武天皇發願創立的。經過了兩次的兵災，佛體在猛火裏燒爛了，後來才補鑄完全，大佛的膝和所坐的蓮瓣有一部分還是創立時遺留下來的。大佛後面地面很寬敞，東側一根大柱挖有方形的窟窿，小孩子從那裏鑽過去，據說可以就受到大佛的保佑。大佛殿以外，寺裏還有幾所殿堂和一個大鍊樓表現着日本古代的藝術，那鐘樓重建於鐮倉時代，其中的大銅鐘高四公尺，口徑兩公尺七，是日本三大鐘之一。</p>
<p>人東大寺出來，不知不覺地走到了嫩草山。這圓圓的山頭是春日山的前峯。滿山舖着蒼綠的細草，平滑得好像絨毯一樣。山脚攔着繩子，堅有木牌。據木脾上的文字，登山每人須納費十錢。朝山的那些小飲食舖，在山脚下成排地搭着舖蓆的板炕，給遊客們休息。我們在那裏停了一會，再沿着山道走去，不一會就見到春日神社的大鳥居。這種牌坊形式的東西，在日本一切神社的前面都有的，，可以說是日木典型的風物之一。過了鳥居便是參道，左右排列着許多石燈籠，直到神殿的前面。這神殿祀奉着日本建國的四神，殿門上端懸有菊紋的布幔。我們走畫了神殿的廽廊，再在周圍散散落落的房屋前面，兜了一轉，於是從旁邊的山道出去。那時已經傍晚了。我們聽到了連續的喇叭聲音，接着看見無數的鹿成着隊奔到一個蘺笆門裏去，原來那地方就是神鹿飼育所，凡是散在公園裏的鹿一聽得吹喇叭就歸隊了。</p>
<p>我們在歸路上還參觀了萬葉植物園，這個園是近年為紀念日本著名的詩人萬葉而設的。園內鍾着萬葉歌咏過的花草竹木一百五十餘種，有池一口，游泳着幾種水禽。</p>
<p>凡是屬於奈良公園的主要的遊覽塲所在我們可以算得全都到過了。這些遊電塲所的要道上到處擺有小攤，售賣淸奈良的名產鹿角，木盤，大佛餅，竹手杖，筆墨以及各式各樣的小玩其。這些貨物有許多顯然是手工製造品。這使我們想到日本的竿工業，並不因機械的進步而衰敗下去，倒因政府提倡農家副業的緣故，在另一途徑發展着。</p>

<h3>僞軍犯綏後　平地泉極安定　平地泉為軍事重心　曾延毅等率部坐鎭</h3>
<p>平地泉通訉、綏東情形、日漸緊張、平地泉為綏東中心、在目前亦為軍事重地、自趙承綬由大同·傅作義由綏遠。先後赴平地泉會晤後、進犯綏東之王道一匪部遭受慘敗、事後傅作義。趙承綬。分別各返原防、刻在平地泉坐鎭老、為傅部旅長綏束保安司令曾延毅、趙部騎兵旅長彭毓賦、率部剿匪以後、亦由前防返回平地泉、當受平地泉人民極熱烈之歡迎與慰勞、正黃旗總管達密凌蘇龍此次剿匪、自吿奮勇、躬為前導、刻亦返平地泉、記者於十日由綏赴平地泉視察、爰記印象如次、</p>
<p>平地泉卽集寗縣、最近平綏路將平地泉車站亦改為集寗縣、集寗縣設治不久、其地頗高、故氣候極凉爽、綏遠本年頗熟、由綏至集、驟覺凉爽、彷彿已入深秋、平地泉目下極為安定、足以打破許多懸想與揣測、社會人心、安定異常、駐軍步騎砲兵均有相當數目、較平時稍覺增多、但軍隊行動、均在夜間、故人民毫不感覺緊張、此地分橋東西兩區域、火車橫貫於中、橋西居民均為土著、商舖亦均為「本地人」所經營、橋東則冀魯豫人為多、本地通稱「東路人」、東路買賣亦均在橋東、橋東西界限劃然、異常分明、商民無形中有對峙形勢、綏遠全省、具有都市雛形而比較繁榮者、除歸化·包頭·以外、卽為平地泉、集寗之與包頭、在綏東綏西、正可遙為輝映、</p>
<p>橋東西各戲園一、橋東之戲園、係新建築、其宏麗壯觀、在綏遠首屈一指、夜間戲園中之觀衆極擁擠、一種雍雍平靖之氣象、可以概見、當地駐軍眷屬、傅作義嚴禁遷移、而所有軍官、亦極樂觀、無人作遝移眷屬之想、社會人心安定、此亦一因、集寗糧商最發達、現有糧店四十家、規模最小者、亦五千元之資本、終年除盡一切花費、尙可得純益萬二千元、規模較大者、盈餘可以概見、因糧食在此地大量出口、於是市面極為繁榮、就綏遠全省稅收上言、此地亦為重要地帶、</p>
<p>目前平地泉為綏東軍事重心、過去經營此地者、令人不能不念及馮玉祥氏、老虎山屏障集寗縣城、山雖小却極險要、民十三年、馮玉祥氏卽開始經營、常時建有極大之營房、可駐軍十師以上、馮意並圖圍老虎山於縣城之內、故當建設之初、集寗縣城規樓頗大、其後營房漸毁、迄於今日、則此最大營房之建築、傾圮坍塌、已無餘跡、當日包圍老虎山之建築、亦漸坍毀、於是縣城乃為之縮小、現在老虎山已劃出城外、駐軍在山頭築有碉堡、紮有帳棚、此次王道一匪部竄擾綏東、外傳與駐軍在老虎山作戰、實則距老虎山尙遠、集寗年來經綏遠當局之經營、軍事上有所準備、已在意中、當地駐軍、極為沈着、此種精神及心理、作用甚大、現在在集寗之軍事領袖為步兵旅長曾延毅、騎兵旅長彭毓賦、蒙兵方面為正黃旗總管達密凌蘇龍曾延毅坐鎭綏東有年、剿匪成續甚佳、極為綏東人民所欽服、曾在綏東、正如王靖國之在綏西、不啻傅作義之左右臂也、王道一匪部未出動之前、卽有匪徒三十餘人在興和境內竄擾、曾部圍剿、一網打盡、匪首于某、僅以身免、此三十餘匪徒悉數伏法、綏東人心大快、</p>
<p>彭毓賦學科最佳、有儒者風、閻錫山對之頗器重、本年閣在幷訓練所部軍官、曾令彭担任教官、最近綏東吃緊、彭始返防、此次剿匪、彭深夜率衆襲匪、直達王道一匪之僞司令部、以少勝多、沈着應戰、閻·傳·趙·極為嘉慰、綏地方人士亦多慰勞之、達密凌蘇龍雖為綏東四旗總管之一、而無形中實居領袖地位、平日剿匪最力、匪甚畏之、達今年五十許、頜下蓄一綹長鬚、約有二尺、平時結成一辮、極為愛護、匪均呼達為「長鬍子」、達對綏東地理最熟、此次王道一匪僞司令部設於土城子、彭旅往襲、達為前導、深夜越匪步哨而間道以入、致匪猝不及防、遭受最大之損失、此役達功有足多者、外傳達有被擄訉、絕對不確、此長鬍子蒙古英雄固猶健在、且此後仍為匪之勁敵可知、</p>
<p>此次匪攻紅根爾圖兩次、均未得逞、常地駐軍及民團人數本不多、因紅根爾圖地勢險要、目軍民團結、故能以少勝多、當地一般人心理、亦足注視、人人皆認為紅根爾圖有如金湯之固、絕不至有虞、正與集寗軍民、認為綏東不至有失之心理相同也、</p>
<p>彭旅此次剿王道一匪司令部、得有各種文件、其中有王匪致某顧問之意見書、及就職文吿等件、措辭極離奇、令人閱之、哭笑不得、王匪稱所謂某高等顧問為夫子大人、而自稱為門生、匪軍則稱西北防共自治軍、</p>

<p>全國美術界心理之一大轉變　　藝術界購用舶來品的油書顏料。或水彩晝顏料。眼前已成為過去的事實。而都以金城工藝社老鷹牌出品取而代之。此一現象。據識者分析。謂有數點値得注意。（一）市上舶來品。大都殘缺不全。絕跡之期已不遠。多少可减却些漏卮，（二）國人也會製造成功百分之百的標準國貨以十足代替外貨。可見中國非絕對沒有埋頭苦幹的人。而且也證明了中國人的智慧。决不稍遜於外國人。（三）藝術界中人。都已具備着敏銳的眼光。和準確的鑒別力。故能汰劣讅優。抉擇無誤。　　於此可見國貨生產者。必須先要造得出十全十美的貨品。纔能獲得消費者自動的信仰。然後會轉變共平素崇拜外貨的心理。是一定不易之理。　　最近各中小學校。因知道了許多專家和教師。都在推許金城工藝社的出品。是國貨之王。品質足和最好牌子的外貨媲美。而價格又低廉多多。故已上行下傚。亦紛紛採用該社老鷹牌六色九色十二色軟錫管水彩顏料。且聞該社出品。雖已歴有年數。然隨時仍在革新改良。以期超標準化。絕不依老賣老。而致落伍。尤為難能可貴云。世運代表團隨征記　（第七信）中央社特派員馮有眞寄　　（八）柏林熱烈歡迎車中一夜未得安睡、身體不免疲乏、可是一十三日早上九時、到柏林所受的熱烈歡迎、使每個人精神都緊張興奮到了極度、把疲倦忘到九霄雲外、　　留德的同胞、包括大使館的職員留學生商人工人、對祖國這次大規模的派遣選手團來德參加世運會、感着極濃厚的興趣、她們事前組織了一個招待處、把歡迎及招待程序、預先籌備就緒、德國方面對邦交索稱敦睦、不遠萬里而來的友邦的選手、當然也是竭誠歡迎的、　　九時一刻專車於軍樂大作、國旗紛舞中、駛抵柏林車站在月台歡迎者有世運會組織委員會代表哈特博士Dr　Ritter　V．Hart柏林市政府代表及我國駐德大使程犬放·戴院長代表丁文淵（戴氏已於七月七日抵柏林）、及各團體代表三十餘人、選手團全體下車後、卽在月台上整隊排列、先由留德學生韓女士獻花、决由哈特博士於播音前代表德國政府及世運會致歡迎詞、沈嗣良答詞後、復領導全體為兩三國呼萬歲、禮畢、卽由足球隊長李惠堂持蔣院長所授的國旗前導、全體整隊出站、在站外歡迎的三百多同胞、均胸佩國徽、手持國旗、歡聲大作、空氣緊張、情緒熱烈、博得柏林一致的好評、當天的各晚報都用大字標題在最醒目處登載詳細的新聞、與各種照片、譽為已抵柏的各國選手隊中最熱烈最整的一慕、　　出站後、除體育考察團一部份團員的十餘人、轉車赴漢堡、其餘赴營地駐宿外、所有各隊選手及職員、分乘大汽車三輛、直赴柏林市政府、至市府大廳中舉行一個簡的歡迎會、市長林伯德Lippurt親臨致詞、態度極為懇摯、　　全體辭別市府後、卽乘車駛赴亞林匹克新村、新村離市達四十公里、十一時一刻抵達新村、前面建了一排人字形的樓房、大門兩旁排列的旗桿、已升了二十一國的國旗、全體下車後、卽至大門前集合、由新村總督傑而賽Gilsa致歡迎詞、沈嗣良答詞、旋由軍樂隊奏我國之歌、舉行升旗禮、我們肅立着、目送靑天白日旗在右面第十一根旗桿上、慢慢的升上去的時候、心裏眞是說不出的快樂、禮畢、卽整隊赴宿舍、在前面引導的樂隊、奏着的悠揚的曲調、選手們精神煥發、步法整齊、極為已抵新村的各國選手所注目、由新村大門到宿舍、的有一千餘公尺、到達後、又舉行升旗禮、卽散隊投宿、　　下午六時駐德大使館·留歐學生總會·留德學生會·工商聯合會在新村附近的惠冷飯店Wihelms　Hotel聯合舉行茶會、歡迎選手團及戴季陶　魯兩氏、到五百餘人、由駐德大使程天放氏主席致歡迎詞、學生會代表江君致詞、戴鄒兩氏及選手團代表郝更生、相繼答詞、茲錄程天使演詞原文如决、程大使演詞　　今日駐德大使館黨部·旅歐和留德兩學生會·工商聯合會·聯合開茶會歡迎戴季陶鄒海濱先生、和世運會中國代表團全體職員和選手、感覺異常榮幸、除鄒先生因出席大學會議和世界教育會議而來歐之外、其餘均為參加世界運動會而來、此點使天放於歡迎之中、有甚深之感觸、　　中國古代文武不分、故對體育異常重視、射御與禮樂書數、同列於六藝、其重要可知、春秋時、列國官吏、平時則為卿大夫、一旦國家有事、卽轉為將校、率兵禦侮、而一般國民亦均能執干戈以衛社稷、苟非平時重視體育、不能做到、孔子為吾國最大之舉者、同時亦嫻武術、故禮稱其習射於矍相之圃、觀者如堵牆、其射法之精、可見降及後世、文武分途、讀書人視運動為鄙賤之事、不屑為之、不復講究體育、國民體格、乃日趨於萎靡、一有外侮、祗有俯首乞憐、毫無抵抗能力、宋以後中國兩度亡於異族、體育之不振、實為重要原因之一、元淸入主中國以後、未幾卽為中國人所同化、故開國時勇武强健之風、不及百年、亦一變而為萎靡軟弱矣、及十九世紀中葉以後、吾人與西洋民族接觸日多、睹其尙武風氣之流行、與國民體格之發達、先覺之士、如夢初醒、知體肯與國家關係之密切、而從事提倡、然積重難返、一般國民、仍未養成運動為日常生活一部份之習慣、故中國提倡新教育已四五十年、而體育成績、較之西洋各國、瞠乎其後、不特西洋式之運動不如人、卽我國固有之技術、亦幾落伍、如日本之柔術、由我國之拳術、蛻化而來、然今日柔術在日本遠較拳術在我國為普遍、中國發明弓箭在西洋之前、今日則北方尙有習射之人、長江以南欲購弓箭而不可得、其衰落至此、而美國則反盛行提倡、各大學均紛設射箭俱樂部，男女生均加入習射風行一時、此等事實、吾人每一念及、輙覺汗顏無地、　　然而慚愧之中、有可以自慰者、在悲觀之中、有可以樂觀者、在則最近十年來、吾國之體育有顯著之進步也、自國民政府定都南京以來、知體育為一切事業之基礎、提倡不遺餘力、故自九一八以後、雖國難嚴重、而全國及各省之運動會繼續舉行、中央關於體育之經費、歲有增加、本年復撥給巨欵以為出席世運會之費用、俾諸君能來德參加、運動成績、較體育先進國、自然相差尙遠、但以與本身比較、由每開一次運動會必有數種新紀錄之發現、卽為進步之表現、球類技術—尤其足球籃球——較十年前亦進步不少、在遠東比賽時、常可擊敗外人、允可喜者、運動風氣、已逐漸普遍、固有之國術、亦逐漸復興、練習者日益衆多、國民體格較昔為勝、尤其靑年女子、已非復昔日弱不禁風之概，此均可供吾人瞻望民族前途而為之興奮也、　　中國參加世運會、此已為第三次、然一九二八年第九屆世運會、我國祗有職員、一九三二年第十屆世運會、我國亦祗派選手劉長春君一人、均祇可認為旁觀性質、本屆則有男女選手七十人、職員二十餘人、國術表演員九人、體育考察員三十餘人、總數達一百四十餘人、實為破天荒之大規模正式參加、國民政府又特派戴院長季陶先生為政府代表、表示鄭重、代表團出國時、蔣院長且親自授旗、以資鼓勵、報紙對代表團消息、逐日詳細記載、政府及國民、對諸君期望之殷、由此可知、而諸君使命之重大、亦不言而喩矣、　　常人每謂運動會選手之使命、在奪錦標、天放殊以為不然、中國旣屬第一次正式參加、諸君能得錦標、固大佳事、卽不能得錦標、國人亦决不責備諸君、諸君之使命、蓋別有所在、諸君在京時、蔣院長曾勉諸君「在道義精神與紀律上、為國家爭光榮」、而德國之國家體育總裁阿思騰、亦吿其運動員「由人格及生活中、表現德意志民族之精神」、故天放認為諸君之使命、一方面在運動塲上、在寄宿舍中、在街頭、在店肆、在公共塲所、一舉一動、處處均表現整齊嚴肅、守紀律明責任之精神、不讓他人有絲毫之指摘、使德國國民及外國來賓、均因與諸君接觸、而對中國人發生良好之影響、另一方面則當觀摩德國人之精神、以帶回中國、吾人均知德國因國戰之失敗、繳械賠欵、喪權失地、至為慘痛、今不及十年、已卓然復興、最近數年來在國際地位、尤提　不少、此實為德人不畏困難、不懼挫折、在領袖領導之下、團結一致、埋頭苦幹之結果、决非倖致、中國今日在存亡絕續之交、亦必有團結一致、擁護中央、服以領袖、埋頭苦幹之决心、始能渡過難關、恢復民族在歷史上光榮之地位、諸君由德返國、以後當盡力宣揚此義、凡與此原則背道而馳者、卽為國家公敵、如是則禦侮救亡、易於收效、諸君能做到此兩層、則雖不得錦標、而對國家所盡力、巳甚大矣、敬祝諸君努力、教育新聞本夏留歐美男女學生之影　（一）　　（一）李伯瓊·復旦大學畢業、入柏林大學理科、（二）李定文·中央大學畢業、人明星大學理科、（三）夏璐緯·入密西根大舉打樣工程、（四）張潔·滬江大學畢業、入紐的大學經濟、（五）沈垚·燕京大學畢業、入密耳斯大學、文學、（六）張朝漢·交通大學畢業、入麻省理工大學、電機（七）徐宗毅·大同大同大學畢業、入弄偷比亞大學、政治、（八）劉志宏·東北大學畢業、入伊利諾大學、鐵路管理、（九）　越·交通大學畢業、入考乃爾大學、土木工程、（十）方善桂·交通大學畢業、入密西根大學、經濟、（十）（一）吳仁伯·約翰大學畢業、入魯方大學、醫科、（十）（二）王宗淦·交通大學畢業、入麻省理工大學、工程、（十）（三）蔣震同·金陵大學畢業、入米納沙太大學、植物病理、（十）（四）周譽侃·武漢大學畢業、入柏林大學、物理、（十）（五）錦偉·復旦大學畢業、入密梳里大學、政治、（十）（六）任明益·東南大學畢業、入米納沙太大學、昆虫、（十）（七）瞿承方·約翰大學畢業、入哈佛大學、醫科、（十）（八）江知勉·震旦大學畢業、入巴黎大學醫科、（十）（九）江希明·浙江大學畢業、入支加哥大學、細菌、（二）（十）徐洽時·浙江火學畢業、入康乃爾大學、土木工程、陳禮江談　失學民敎六年計劃　　（中央社十五日南京電）實施年　長失學　民衆補習　敎育辦法、經敎部令發各敎廳局切實遵辨後、據陳禮江談、此項補敎、以民校為實施機關、另以民教館、或中心民校為補導考核機關、至設校計劃、敎部擬照自治區坊·鄉·鎭·區域分六年設立、每校至少兩班、每班五十人、以四個月為完成期、計每校每年至少可辦兩期可敎二百人、預計第一年內全國各縣、市共設民校六千校、可敎一千二百萬人、以後每縣逐年增設二十校、計設一萬校、可教二千萬人、第三年設一萬四千校、可教二千八百萬人、第四年設一萬八千校、可教三千六百萬人、第五年設二萬二千校、可教四千四百萬人、第六年設二萬六千校、可教五千二百萬人、至民國三十一年六年限期屆滿、的有一萬萬失學民衆可受到訓練、四十五歲以下文盲、可盡數掃除、二十三文化團體　今日歡送出洋學生　下午四時在市府大禮堂　由吳市長主席致歡送詞　　本市寰球中國學生會等二十三文化團體、定於今日下午四時、假市府大禮堂、舉行聯合致送、出洋學生大會、由吳市長主席、致歡送詞、張法堯等演說、參加者、除留學生外中外各界領袖、如杜月笙·穆藕初·王曉籟·汪伯奇·楊光泩·李大超·徐新六·劉湛恩·沈怡·馬崇淦·董顯光·美領事英格台爾等、亦均蒞會、茲分誌各情如决、　　參加團體　寰球中國學生會·上海市教育局·交通大學·暨南大學·光華大學·啟秀女中·南洋中學·上海市商會·市教育會·市地方協會·中華職業教育社·國際問題研究會·德奧瑞同學會·同濟校友會·申報館·新聞報館·民報館·中華日報館·大陸報館·中國評論週報社·商務印書館·中華書局·世界書局·等二十三文化團體、　　大會職員　主席市長吳鐵城、演講張法堯博士等、招待朱少屏吳德寅等、其餘每一團體准派代表二人、到塲協助一切、幷須二時前到達會塲、從事佈置、　　大會秩序　（一）振鈴開會、（二）主席吳市長致詞、（三）演說張法堵堯博士、（四）答詞留學生代表沈壵女士、王象堯君、徐宗毅君、（五）奏樂、（六）茶點、（七）攝影、今日參加人數、約在四百人以上、可由寳山路搭四號公共汽車可直達市政府云、上海靑年會　歡送留學學生　　上海靑年會、每屆夏季向有學生招待處之設、一方面指導各地來滬及由滬前往各地投考之學生、一方面備出洋留學人士之諮詢、辦理以來、頗具成績、本年由該會幹事曹炎申博士、主理其事、國內外學生之前往接洽者頗不乏人、茲聞有出洋學生數十人、定於十七日乘格蘭總統號放洋、該會向有歡送之舉、本屆特改定方式備送花籃外、並每人各贈介紹函、介紹美國各地一千二百餘靑年會及留美學生會、幹事蕭元恩君、以便隨時招待、隨事照拂、此種辦法、於出洋各學生、頗多實益、塡報　敎員聘任表　　上海市教育局昨訓令市立各小學云、查市立各小學本學期應行呈報教員聘任表、早經令發表式、限於開學前塡報二份到局核聘在案、茲距開學期近、所有未報是項表格到局核聘各校、自應於八月二十二日前、一律依限呈報、否則即行指派市校

<p>兒童專刊團結  婉文　　小朋友們！我為甚麼要講團結呢？因為在這國難臨頭，非常時期中，團結是十分重要的；國內人民不團結，外人更可乘機來侵略我們，到那時，我國前途的險惡可想而知了。國內倘能團結，而且團結得很堅固，那麼我國不難脫離被侵略者的地位，由弱國一變而為强國。　　你們記得嗎？西洋人不是說：「我國好似一盤散沙」。無怪他們看見了我國的弱點，來欺侮我們了，我們要消滅外人輕視我國的觀念，而使國家富强，團結也是方法之一。　　團結一定要有組織，否則雜亂無章，反而無益，所以便有成立團體的必要，團結是組成團體的要素，倘團體中個人和個人間沒有團結的力量，便無所謂團體了。　　團體的行事所以比個人行事來得容易成功，因為團體由許多人集合而成，每人都有專門的學問，經驗，分工合作，各盡所能，其成功當然比個人容易得多了。　　那麼我們怎樣團結呢？我們可以在學校和家庭間團結起來；在學校中，師生及同學間，不因自己的利益，而有一些成見，要遵守校規，服從教師的指導，對同學和氣，組成一個切實的學校團體。在家庭中，弟妹間要友愛，聽從父母的教訓，組成、一個快樂的家庭團體。這樣團結的習慣養成後，將來處身於社會，組成一個大而堅固的團體，為社會服務，為國家爭榮，小朋友們！團結起來吧！兒童掌故隨談  易生　　元方責客　　陳元方從小就很穎悟强記。有一天，他的父親陳　留有賓客在家，教他同他北弟李方燒飯。不迫道小兄弟倆偷聽賓主間的議論過久，疎忽了火候，煮成一鍋爛飯。父親責問他倆，他倆只得訴陳事由，長跪請罪。父親間：「那麼，你們聽了這許久時候，也有多少了解的麼？」這兩個孩子搶着複述一遍，毫無遺漏，還有好多意見參加着。父親不禁點頭道：「能得道樣，就是吃一餐爛飯也罷了！」日說另有一次，陳實與一個朋友要偕同出行，相的在午時會面。過了午時那個朋友還沒有到來，陳實只得獨行了。不道他走了沒一會兒，那個朋友忽忽趕到。那時元方纔只有七歲，正在門首玩要。來客便問他：「你的父親在家麼？」他答道：「等候你許久不來，爸爸已經獨自走了。」客人聽了老大沒趣，喃喃地說道：「眞不是人！相的同行，却放人家的生！」元方趨前大聲說道：「你和爸爸的會在午時，準時不到是沒有信甩，對人家的兒子駡他的父親又是沒有禮貌；哼，這等人！……」客人自覺羞慚，下車想來牽引他表示歡意。元方一直走進目家的大門，頭也不回。　　俗語有道：「理駁泰山。」陳元方認淸了理路，據理資難一個父執之輩，不怕他不發生內愧。有些孩子們聽得人家當面毀駡他家裏的人，不知—或者不敢—當塲抗爭。至少這是顯示了你的懦弱，反被人家瞧不起，認為不識羞恥，往後更要重重地，狠狠地欺到你的頭上來了！小朋友們須得記住，此等處是一點也不能讓人家的！幼時回憶的夏蟲  達齋　　死者可以復生無論任何動物，已經死去許久，若想「起死回生，」再把他活轉過來，本不是容易的事；何况微弱的蟲類呢，幼時我的表兄曾將一個淹死的蒼蠅向我說：「我會念咒，呌它死的變成活的呢！」便取些冷木柴灰，把蠅掩埋着；口中「念念有詞，」說是神秘的咒語。過了一會，蒼蠅居然從灰裏爬出來，非常的活潑。我當時很為驚訝，後來我遇着死過了的蟲，如蜻蜓蟬……都要請他念咒變活；他不肯，就和他糾纏不休，他說：「咒語那裏眞有什麼魔力？不過借此哄人吧了！理由是；灰能吸收水分，溺死的　，本為水脹，水被灰吸乾，才能活轉；並且要在冷水裏溺死才可，如係熱水燙死，便不行了；這些自死的蟲，我有何神秘能够變活呢？凡事須推求原理，不要盲從迷信，此事雖小，可以喻大啊！」　　斷者可以復續　蟲折損了足部的小部份，雖然是傷殘，還可以生活；設或傷及胸腹部，或是竟被截斷了，沒有個不死的，還能望恢復完好的原狀嗎？有種名呌土龞的蟲，（生在靠近地面的磚裏，可做藥用，國藥店裏有得賣，不過是製過死的，可以用作標本，觀察它的形態。）攔腰用刀斬做兩段，再放在磚下，過了兩天翻開取看，那兩半段居然合而為一，接續起來，完好如初了。它有這種特性，是一般蟲類所沒有的，所以搜集入藥，能够治病，這不是在生理上一種很有趣的蟲　？幼時曾試騐過的，因述及之，微小蟲類，還能救殘補缺，轉危為安，小朋友，當要怎樣創造自已新生命和國家新生命呢！熱與色的關係是怎樣發現的？  慕傑　　富蘭克林不但發現了神出鬼沒的電，而且又在無意中發現許多瑣細的事物，這裏說的是他發現熱與色的關係的故事。　　一天，他到友人家中閒談，吃飯後照例飲些咖啡茶，主人見茶冷得很，就抱歉的說道：　　「請你原諒！並不是我有意給你吃冷茶，因為那僕人懶惰，不把茶壺擦揩乾凈，弄得那壺黑黝黝的，茶當然冷了」！　　他想：茶放在較黑些的壺中怎會易冷呢？乃道「黑」容易吸去別種的熱麼，那末，同「黑」相對的「白」將怎樣呢？　　終於，他得了個機會試騐，他在溶雪的日子，把黑白布各一塊覆在雪上，隔不多時候他再去看看，黑布下面的雪溶完了，而白布下面一些未溶，於是他確定了「黑」容易傳遞熱與吸收熱，而「白」呢？却適得其反。　　現在，小朋友們不是冷天穿深色的衣服，熱天穿淡色的衣服嗎？這都是因為深色會吸收與傳遞日光，而淡色會拒絕與反射日光的緣故呀兒童創作初秋時的兒童衛生  萬竹小學校曹宏輝　　光陰如流水，炎夏一過，又入初秋的季節了，那隻秋老虎，又要活動起來，眞是可怕得很！我們兒童，將來就是國家的主人翁，對於衛生一道，也應該研究研究。一入秋季，天氣漸凉爽，一不小心，就容易生病的。現在拿我個人的一二意見，貢獻與全國的小朋友。　　（一）不貪凉睡覺天氣一入秋節，就要盡熱夜凉，貪凉睡覺，最易得病，如腹痛等，都是貪凉得來，小朋友們，臨睡的時候，蓋上一條薄被，一唿醒來，包你不會受寒而腹痛。　　（一）不貪吃冷物古書云：「禍從口出」「病從口入」那眞是不錯的，在這夏末秋初的時候，我們人身的外皮，是覺得熱，內腑是凉的，（這是聽醫生講的）內部旣然是凉，豈可以再貪吃冷的東西呢，所以像「冰淇淋，荷蘭水」以及馬路傍邊小販賣的「凍粉凉水，」大家都不要買來喝。　　（一）不買腐爛食物馬路上的小販，只圖自己賺錢，專門販賣腐爛的食物，如爛桃子爛瓜等等，價鈿便宜，我們小朋友不懂，向爸爸媽媽討了銅板來，買這種食物吃，那是危險得很。飛艇和飛機  順　　在這戎馬倉皇，國難當頭的時候，誰都知道，鞏固國防是當今唯的要務；而鞏固國防則非首先發展航空，使有强有力的空軍不可。近年來各地提倡航空，足見國人已經曉得航空對於國防的重要了。小朋友—你們兒童界裏，近來不是也有人，正在發起購買兒童號和童子軍號的飛機嗎？這確實是你們兒童界裏，一件値得讚美的光榮的事情呀！　　小朋友！飛艇（卽飛船）在什麽時候纔有相常的成功？誰發明的？飛艇怎麽能够飛？這幾個問題，你們知道嗎？假使你們不知道　　，那我就在下面吿訴你們：　　現在我們先要來研究的，是飛艇所以能飛的原因：飛艇是由氣球改造而成功的，它的上面有長橢圓形的氣囊。因為氣囊裏面，裝有比空氣輕的氣體；像氫氣和氦氣）所以利用了空氣的浮力，能够浮在空中。（正像船能够在水中浮起一樣）至於它的下面，是懸有一隻小艇，艇上面有二舵，一垂直，是有用以司方向的；一水平，是川以司上下移動之用的。另外艇上還裝有推進機，所以依　了空氣的抵抗力，使飛艇依水平面方面進行。　　接下去要談的，就是另外兩個問題：公曆一九〇〇年七月二日那一天，有一個德國的科學家，呌徐伯林的，造成一隻硬式的飛艇，（氣囊中設有錩的支架的就是硬式；否則就是柔式）在君士坦丁湖上，高四白公尺的空中，在二十分鐘內，飛行了六公里。　　飛艇的幾個問題，我們已經解决了。同樣，飛機也有幾個問題，我想在這裏同你們談談　　最先要說的，是飛機所以能飛的原理：飛機上面是不設氣囊的，它是專靠機械力的運動，使飛機本體疾馳；這樣它的兩翼下面自然發生風力，飛機也就借了這風力，向上飛起。飛機的尾部也有水平垂直舵，可以司昇降和轉向的。　　現在要吿訴你們的，就是誰造成了最初的飛機？小朋友！最初的飛機，就是兩個美國人造成的呀！（他們二人是兄弟，一名維爾伯賴特，一呌奧比賴特）可是，眞正實用的飛機，在一九〇八年才有相當的成功：那年賴特兄曾有一次，　小時又一刻鐘內，飛行了四十五英里。但是我要聲明，上面說的是陸上飛機，就是飛機在陸上昇降的。　　至於飛機在水面上昇降的，就是水上飛機。水上飛機是亭利哈布，在一九一〇年三月二十八日那一天纔開始用的。科學小常識  （藏）　　上山時何以比下山時要走得慢？　　諸位小朋友，我們在平地上面走，我們的力氣只要抵抗空氣的抵抗力和舉動兩隻脚就好了。下山時氣力更用得少，因為那時地心吸力將我們漸漸吸到地而，可以帮助我們一部分的氣力。但是倘從極峻峭的山上下來，却非常覺得吃力，因為那時我們必須要留心我們身體的平均量。我們的脚趾必定要抵住鞋的內面，而且腦筋時常存層山高跌下的恐懼心，所以很覺得疲乏。說到上山却是更難的了；那時全靠我們全身的飭力，將全身從地心吸力　望上提；所以所用的力氣一定要比地心吸的力氣大方能向上。兒童自由畫—上海市高境廟  （梁　瑚）童子軍信箱一件有趣味的事（弟妹們組織起來）　　——答北平孔璉姑娘——　　剛從北平回到上海，便接到你給我們的信，假使你的信早來些時日，也許我們會到願和園你們的寓所裏去拜訪。　　你感覺到北方沒有適當的童子軍團部，容許你去做他們的團員。不過我知道北平靑年會——米市大街——少年部有一個童子軍團部，是任何少年男女都可以加入的。記得本社沒有南遷前，辦公室也在靑年會，知道他們的團部也有三位女童子軍，這次我們去北平，沒有到靑年會去；可不大知道他們最近的底細，你可以從頤和園乘公共汽車一直到靑年會去打聽一下。其實你自己家不是現成的有一個童子軍活動的雛形擺着麼？你不是有七位弟妹麼？連你八個人，組織起來不就是偭童子軍小隊？隊員都是弟弟妹妹，豈不更要親熱些個呢！而且你們天生成的番號，老大，老二，老三，……的排編下去，你就是隊長，你的弟弟便是副隊長，你們每天在一起，又是在那美麗的，有山有水的願和園裏，許多的童子軍工作都可以做起來啦，外面倘沒有你可以加入的童子軍團部，那又何必白費心思的去亂鑽呢？　　假使我處在你的地位，我便會自己幹起來，例如媽媽屬牛的，我便訂我們的隊　　小牛隊，按規矩選定了隊色和呼號。——假使你不明白，可以再來信問吧。——隊部就設在銅亭裏，營地在萬壽山的後面要找多麼適宜的都有。隊長可以發命令放步哨，可以一直放到了二十七孔橋，在長廊裏練習軍步，又是多麼相宜，排雲殿前舉行營火會，更又是到那裏去我這再好不過的地方—那營火光可以把昆明湖反映得更鮮美。就是慈禧太后當初也沒有享到這麼偉大的淸福呀！可是我警告你，千萬別在石舫上行下水禮，因為昆明潮裏的水，不相宜於游泳；卽使臥佛寺後面的那個池子，都不相宜。假使懶得進城到中南海去，玉泉山一帶的泉水裏倒可以頑頑。　　你的意思怎樣？我們相信祗要你能找一位高級童子軍來帮你們的忙，事情就很容易進行的了。希望你能再給我們一點消息。請了，祝你們成功！　　中國童子軍自助社謹覆築巢的魚  董遜　　在水族中也有幾種魚類是跟鳥類一樣地，它們把巢築在水。插圖中右面的一種魚名呌巢魚，左面的一種是門魚，這兩種魚都能在水中築巢的，不過築巢的方法各不相同罷了。　　巢魚屬於棘魚科，日本人稱它為一米掰米托妙　」。它的背鰭有八根像針一般的硬棘，胸　也各有一根硬棘；尾柄很狹，全身體長的五十糎左右。體色背部靑黑，腹部淡黃。　　這種魚生存在水底，就是水流非常湍急的水中，它們也能棲息。它們常在芹菜的根莖上築巢而居，築巢的材料，有水藻，草根，枯莖及其他的植物體；巢築得很精緻很像一個敲破一端的蛋殼。等到產卵時期，它們的卵就產在巢中。而親魚呢？它們總是很勤力謹　地守在巢旁保護，直要等到它們的稚仔，從魚卵孵化成為稚魚始止。　　你看：這魚豈不是跟鳥類很相像的嗎？　　鬥魚產在我國廣東，及琉球，臺灣，朝鮮一帶，日本東京近年亦有蕃殖。（暹羅所產之鬥魚與此種不同）這種魚體長自六十糎至八十經，口尖：雌魚的背鰭比雄魚要短狹些，尾　成圓扇形。其體色或淡綠或淡灰，並有紅褐色之直條紋十。眼睛則為鮮紅色。　　其嘴中能　吐一種泡泡，這種睡液中含有一種物質，遇水以後就能使它變成牢固的。春夏之交時，雄魚吹泡沫而作覆碗形的巢，浮在水面，雌魚就把卵產在泡中間。雄魚則在巢下保護之。　卵子經過二十四小時卽能孵化，仔魚就暫存在道泡沫所成的巢中間。　　此魚爭鬥性頗强烈，因之近來有許多人飼育它，以供玩賞。　　除這兩種魚外，還有一種蝶魚，也能築巢，我國崇明及臺灣等處亦有產之。國王與牧童（四）  新　　那高個子的侍從又央求着說道：「陛下，怎麼樣？　　「好好，我就來了」。國主一面說，一面很不高興的騎上了他的小馬，把那馬頭拎向遠處的王宮，隨又對那牧童喊道：「孩子，再會吧」。　　那黑頭髮的牧童華樂獨坐在那裏。悄悄地沈思着，把他的笛子也忘在草堆裏了。一點鐘一點鐘的過去了。太陽帶着富麗的橘色和黃金色，從地平綫上沉將下去。昏黃的暮色漸漸地變成了漆黑，忽地來了一陣大點子的雨，冷冷地落在他的頭上。但他仍然沈思着。末後，他才站直身來，很疲倦的趕着他的羊羣回家去了。　　他坐下來用他的晚餐，一聲兒不響的自管吃着粥，咬着黑麵包。　　他的母親忙着問道：「我的兒，你是怎麼一回事？我不聽得你舌尖上吐出一句話來」。　　華樂答道：「母親，我見過王七了」。　　他的母親問道：「你可是瞧見那位小王陛下嗎？試想他和你是同日出世的，你們兩個孩子，大小也差不多吧」。　　那黑頭髮的牧童華樂答道：「是的，他的身材並不此我高，我也並不低於他，而我似乎要比他强壯一些。啊，母親，但是他騎着那麼一頭可愛的馬，穿着那麼一身華貴的衣服，而他的頭上還戴着那麼一頂亮晶晶的王冠哩！那上面的光亮似乎是給他從太陽上摘下來的。啊！母親，我很願意像他那麼做一位國王，身上穿着五色斑爛的衣服，騎着馬出去逛，也不用再去看管那些呆羊了。」　　她的母親笑道：「華樂：你也要做國王嗎？當然咯，天下是沒有滿足的人的，但我以為做一個好的牧人，勝於一位壞的國王，而據他們說，要做一位國王實在是不容易的事，一般老百姓比了羣羊要難服侍得多哩。總之，你們兩個孩子信奉着同樣的一位上帝，你在草屋裏信奉他和他在宮殿裏信奉他是一樣容易的。做一個良好的牧人是一件可以驕傲的事情，我在這裏想，別的不用說，譬如那風濕病，不瞥你是高貴的或是卑賤的，它照樣的要鑽到你骨節裏來，所以人世間貴賤平等，不分甚麼高低呢。」。　　但是那黑頭髮的華樂聽了這些話，仍然不能安慰他的心。他第一次留意到自己的身上是穿着一張寒蠢的爛羊皮，而所住的屋子又是多麼的狹小呀！　　當下他問道：「那國王的宮殿是怎般模樣的？」　　他的母親說道：「咦，據他們說，那王宮是全用大理石和金塊子造成的，天花板上還有千百盞的燈在霍霍地發亮，我幷且聽說小王所睡的那張牀比了我們這間屋子還要大，那牀頂和牀帳也都是用黃金製成的」　　那黑頭髮的華樂不住的閃動着一雙眼睛，又深深地吐了一口氣。</p>

<p>電信特栞六十萬元代價的祈望  楨　　本省往來的電報價目，交通部公布自九月一日起，除交際電報外，一律减低百分之三十，依據統計預算，每年的須减少報費六十萬元上下，這個數目，在電政經濟竭蹶之時，不能不算為「驚人之舉」了！　　一般地說：電報是國營事業，是公衆通信的利器，牠的價目應當儘量地减低，使適合一般公衆的需要，經費如有不够，應由國庫撥給，這是應當而必要的；可是我國電政創辦數十年來，全在「以電養電」上維持，曾未得國庫的補助，不獨未得補助，且北京政府所負欠以電政為名而非用於電政之債務，也要在電政項卞支付本息。所以交通當局，雖想把電報價目儘量减低，而事實上不得不有相當地考慮。　　本來國營事業的性質，與民營事業，完全不同：前者是便利公衆，後者是圖謀利益。使利公衆的辦法，莫若减輕公衆負擔，公衆負擔减輕以後，然後利用者增多，此項事業，然後有發展的希望。交通當局本了這個原則，終於將本省電報價目减低百分之三十了！　　依照上項理由，交通部此次减低電報價目，意義甚為重大：一方面表示電報業務的發達，在於利用電報公衆的普遍，一方面表示電政經濟的維持，决不在公衆身上想法子。這種遠大的眼光，與精密的計劃，是値得我們佩服的。　　交通部主辦的電信事業，便利公衆體恤公衆的辦法，現在可謂「無微不至」了！可是公衆應如何表示合作呢！　　我想公衆合作之道有二：（一）精神的：凡電政上的種種計劃，公衆們應予以十分的同情，使種種計劃，完全現實；（二）物質的：凡電政上的種種設施，公衆們應予以十分的贊助，使種種設施已完成者，不致破壞，未完成者，從速完成。公衆們與電信界打成一片，通力合作，然後電信事業，確實能達到了公用事業的任務，那麼，這次電報减價的代價，何止六十萬元咧？最近交部改訂電報價目之意義  頌英　　電報價目與民衆通信及電政經濟，均有深切關係。我國國內電報價目，自遜淸開辦電報時起，至民國十七年十月為止，向採分省計費制度。在遜淸時，曾採隔省遞加報費辦法，例如本省往來之華文明語尋常電每字收費一角，每隔一省，每字加收報費三分，故由內地發往邊遠省區之電報，最高者每字須收報費四角。民國成立以後，報價疊經更改，在十七年十月以前，本省報價為每字八分，出省報價為每字一角六分，直至十七年十月十日始改為現行之全國劃一價目。所有發往國內各處電報，不論本省出省，為按同一價目收費。此項報價雖屬簡單整齊，便於計算報費。惟我國幅員遼闊，電報綫路雖已遍佈全國，發往邊遠各省之電報，因技術關係，不得不經過若干中間電局之轉遞，所耗人工材料實較短距離之本省電報奚啻倍蓰。準此以觀，上項劃一報價，不僅屬於公衆旣覺不甚公允，在電局成本方面計算，亦極不經濟。　　國內電報價目，亟應加以調整，本刋亦曾討論及之。茲聞交通部已通飭各電報局及無綫電臺自九月一日起，將本省往來之各種電報除交際電外，一律减價百分之三十。例如華文明語尋常電原價每字一角，减為七分，華文密語或洋文明密語尋常電减為每字一角四分，華文明語加急電减為一角四分，華文密語或洋文明密語加急電减為二角八分，華文明密語官軍電减為三分五厘，洋文明密語官軍電，减為七分，華文明密語全價官電，减為七分，洋文明密語全價官電，减為一角四分，華文新聞電减為二分，洋文减為四分，華文加急新聞電减為七分，洋文加急新聞電减為一角四分，均較原價减低百分之三十。此次减但本省電報價日，依據統計預算，每年約須减少報費收入六十萬元左右。但交通部不惜犧牲，而毅然實行者，其動機興目的無非為减輕民衆負擔，以資增進通信便利。至交際電報價目僅為每字二分，本已低廉，無可再减。至發往他省之各種華洋文電報一律仍按現行價目收費。並未增加　足見此次更改國內電報價目，固非為牟利也。　　吾人拍發電報，往往電文僅寥寥數字而收報入姓名住址則須十餘字。一般發報人殊感不甚經濟。交通部有鑒於此，曾於二十三年訂定華文收報人姓名住址减費辦法，凡上項姓名住址不逾十五字者僅作五字計費。現行國內電報營業通則內之收報地名及收報人住址名稱特別規定一節，亦係依據上述原則規定。此項省費辦法實行以來，對於姓名住址字數較多之電報，固覺合算，但對於收報人姓名住址字歡較少之電報，尙嫌不甚風宜。蓋我國習俗，平時收電較多之商行，往往僅須書寫行名，電局卽能照送，無須贅以街名及門牌號數，例如「南通恒豐」，實際上僅有四字，但照現行章規，須付五字報費，豈不反為吃虧。又此項省費辦法實行後，一般發報人因收報人姓名住址在十五字以內者，僅作五字計費，往往將不必要之街名稱謂等字加入，以致電局傳遞時虛耗人工材料，亦屬不貲。故交通部為公允起見，業已通飭各電報局將華文電報收報人姓名住址計費辦法改訂如下：　　（一）使用華洋文電報掛號字樣代替收報人住址名稱之各種電報，其掛號字樣及收報地名仍照電報掛號章稈之規定辦理。　　（二）各種電報之收報地名暨收報人住址名稱詳細書寫者，（使用電話號碼或郵箱號數代替住址者，亦作為詳細書寫論，）其　報地名及收報人姓名住址以二字作一字　　。如有尾數不滿二字者，亦作一字計費。　　以上改訂之本省電報價目及收報人姓名住址計費辦法，均自本年九月一日起實行，所有國內電報營業通則內有關之第六十四條，第八十二條，第八十三條及八十四條條文，以及國內電報價目表，亦經交通部修正重印後，令發各電報局及無綫電臺，以備各界索閱矣。首都話局改進話務之一端  光明　　交通部自上年九月間實行電報業務通信稽查辦法以來，對於各地報局對外服務情形，愈益明瞭，藉此改善業務，給予公衆便利不少。近交部又為改進電話業務起見，發行電話業務通信稽查片一種，於本年八月份起，飭由首都電話局先行試辦，俟辦有成效，再推廣至其他電話局，藉使話局業務，獲得通盤之改善。茲將該項話務稽查片塡寫辦法，錄之於後，以供衆覽：　　（一）該項稽查片由話局發給用戶，隨時塡用，凡用戶遇有：一，話局員工服務不周，應對無禮，或需索酒資情事；二，請求解釋各項電話章程；三，其他對於話局不滿意或建議事項，均可填用該片通知話局辦理。如情節重要者，用戶並可同時通知交通部電政司核辦。某關於裝移拆修話機等事項，仍照平常手續通知話局辦理，不適用該片。　　（二）用戶報告關於上述第一項之事件，應詳叙日期時間，如係需索酒資，並須註明數目，以便於查實後如數退還。該項稽查片塡妥後，由用戶付郵投寄，或逕自送交話局。用畢可向話局索取。　　該片內容，計分「電話號碼」「名稱」「地址」「陳述事項」「話局處理經過」「用戶簽名蓋章」等欄，用戶塡寫極為便利，洵促進電話業務之一良好設施也。交部上海廣播電台增添婦女敎育節目  韋立　　—特創「婦女通問」—　　上海沙遜大厦交通部上海廣播電台鑒於婦女教育之重要，為使一般婦女在娛樂中增進實際知識起見，已於七月十三日（星期一）起，每逢星期一四下午五時一刻至五時三刻，特請胡沈二女士擔任婦女節目，舉凡婦女日常生活之實際知識，一般常識，均將儘量廣播，俾一般家庭婦女能獲得水準以上之生活知識，以收廣播教育之實益。　　該台複為便於婦女聽衆之詢問起見，並自卽日起特創「婦女通問」一項，歡迎各地婦女直接投函詢問，茲探錄該項通問規則於后：　　婦女通問規則　　一、凡聽衆對於有關婦女之各項實際問題，以及婦女日常家事生活，有何疑難之處，歡迎賜函通問。　　二、每决通函以三個問題為限。　　三、通函如需函復，須附足回件郵票。本埠二分，外埠五分，當卽分別答復。　　四、通函中如有普遍性者，擇要在空中廣播，俾多數婦女均可同時得到適當的指導。　　五、聽衆如來函提出各項婦女實際問題而値得公開討論者，常於空中詳為研討，以收互相砥礪之益。　　六、通問信件逕寄上海沙遜大厦一三九號交通部上海廣播電台「婦女通問處」收。勿寫個人姓名。　　該台呼號為XOHC，週率一三〇〇千週云。關於長途電話價目表之整頓　　查長途電話不論本區省際，其兩地間可以直接通話之價目，方可列入價目表內，其不能直接通話者，自不應列入，以免混淆。交通部主辦之長途電話事業，近來日趨發達，新添營業處所甚多，每新添一處，其與各處通話價目，問有未經試話先行擬定者，開放以後是否可以完全直接通話？尙無稽考。聞該部電政司為明瞭各區各局處實際通話情形起見，已飭各管理局將各該區各局處能與本異區各處直接通話之價目，分別省內省際列表寄呈，以後並應於每年六月及十二月月終，按照各局處實在通話情形，將上項價目表重行塡寄一次。又各區每月如有新添營業所或增加互通地點之處，除開放通話日期，用公電報司外，所有通話價目，亦經飭知應於月終彙報一次，限决月五日以前寄呈，以便查考云。閘北長途電話台成立記  記者　　交通部上海電話局建設之閘北新長途電話台，位於閘北育嬰堂路永與路之南，貼鄰於閘北電話分局之東，地畝面積，的零畝五六分，建有水泥鋼骨三層樓洋房一幢，底層分（一）發電間，（二）電瓶房，（三）增昔機間，（四）修理房，中層前部為國際無綫電通話房，後部為長途電話交接台，上層為宿舍，建設頗為新穎美觀，該台全部房屋，已於上月落成。　　房屋落成以後，卽將全部新式機器裝置竣事。該項機器，購自英倫，係最新樣式，先於八月四日起，連續試騐，與國內外通話，結果異常圓滿，故於八月八日午夜十二時半，正式開放啟用，與國內外通話。　　新台成立通話後，原有舊台，業已撤銷，話務較舊台改進之點有三（一）新台附設增音機，其啟用時，能隨時增高聲音：（二）已通話之國內長途話綫及國外話綫，實行同一交換綫，由新台通話；（三）今後新台國內國外通話，無論有錢與無綫電話，能直接接通收聯絡通話之效。　　新長途電話台之通話撥號辦法如下：凡華界自動機用戶，欲通國內長途電話者，先撥「四零」，然後呌接對方之號碼。（卽受話人）租界先撥「零二」，轉長途台中繼錢呌接。國外通話者，租界用戶須撥「零三」，華界方面由南市、龍華·市中心區·眞茹四處中繼綫轉長途台接通。發往南美法屬幾內亞電報價目之改訂　　查我國發往南美洲法屬幾內亞各處之電報價目，名目繁多，不便計算。現經加以整理，規定發往Cayenec。地方者，尋常電每字計八·二六法郎，新聞電二·二九法郎，發往共他地方者，尋常電每字八·六七法郎·茲特列表如左：</p>

<p>讀書俱樂部「一個日本人的中國觀」序  魯迅　　—原序係日文，尤炳圻漢譯。　　這也並非自己的發見，是在內山書店裏聽着漫談的時候拾來的，據說：像日本人那樣的喜歡「結論」的民族，就是無論是聽議論，是讀書，如果得不到結論，心裏總不舒服的民族，在現在的世上，好像是頗為少有的，云。　　接收了這一結論之後，就時時令人覺得很不錯。例如關于中國人，也就是這樣的。明治時代的支那研究的結論，似乎大抵受着英國的什麼人做的「支那人氣質」的影響，但到近來，却也有了面目一新的結論了。一個旅行者走進了下野的有錢的大官的書齋，看見有許多很貴的硯石，便說中國是「文雅的國度」；一們觀察者到上海來一下，貿幾種猥褻的書和圖畫，再去尋尋奇怪的觀覽物事，便說中國是「色情的國度」。連江蘇浙江一帶，大喫竹筍的事，也算作色情心理的表規的一個證據。然而廣東和北京等處，因為竹少，所以並不怎麼喫竹筍。倘到窮文人的家裏或者寓裏去，不但無所謂書齋，連硯石也不過用着兩角錢一塊的傢伙。一看見這樣的事，先前的結論就通不過去了，所以觀察者也就有些窘，不得不另外摘出什麽適當的結論來。于是這一回，是說支那很難懂得，支那是「迷的國度」了。　　據我自己想；只要是地位，尤其是利害一不相同，則兩國之間不消說，就是同國的人們之間，也不容易互相瞭解的。　　例如罷，中國向西洋派遣過許多留學生，其中有一位先生，好像也並不怎樣喜歡研究西洋，於是提出了關於中國文學的什麼論文，使那邊的學者大喫一驚，得了博士的學位，回來了。然而因為在外國研究得太長久，忘記了中國的事情，回國之後，就只好來教授西洋文學，他一看見本國乞丐之多，非常詫異，慨歎道：他們為什麼不去研究學問，却自甘墮落的呢：所以下等人實在是無可救藥的。　　不過這是極端的例子。倘使長久的生活於一地方，接觸着這地方的人民，尤其是接觸，感得了那精神，認眞的想一想，那麼，對于那國度，恐怕也未必不能瞭解罷。　　著者是二十年以上，生活於中國，到各處去旅行，接觸了各階級的人們的，所以來寫這樣的漫文，我以為實在是適當的人物。事實勝于雄辯，這些漫文，不是的確放着一種異彩嗎？自己也常常去聽漫談，其實是負有捧塲的權利和義務的，但因為已是很久的「老朋友」了，所以也想添幾句壞話在這里。其一，是有多說中國的優點的傾向，這是和我的意見相反的。不過著者那一面，也自有他的意見，所以沒有法子想。還有一點，是並非壞話也說不定的，就是讀起那漫文來，往往頗有令人覺得「原來如此」的處所，而這令人覺得「原來如此」的處所，婦根結蒂，也還是結論。幸而卷末沒有明記着「第幾章：結論」，所以仍不失為漫談，總算還好的。　　然而即使說是慢談，著者的用心，還是在將中國的一部分的眞相，紹介給日本讀者的。但是，在現在，總依然是因了各種的讀者，那結果也不一樣罷。這是沒有法子的事。據我看來，日本和中國的人們之間，是一定會有互相瞭解的時候的。新近的報章上，雖然又在竭力的說着「親善」呀，「提携」呀，到得明年，也不知道又將說些什麼話，但總而言之，現在却不是這時候。　　倒不如看看漫文，還要有意思一點罷。文章之吟誦  錢基博　　序黃仲蘇著「朗誦法」　　朗誦法者，當代之絕學，而吾友黃仲蘇先生之所著也。近世文章道盡，士不悅學！其粗通古學者，往往專治古人名物制度訓詁書數，曼衍雜說，沾沾自喜；而於詞章語言之妙，罕之吟會！其尤甚者，敢為詭誕，自輕家丘，曰彼都人士，治文學者不如是也！夫吃文為患，生於好詭；逐新趣異，故喉唇糺紛：在昔劉彥和之所深歡；而今有甚焉者！獨仲蘇以名公子，生長典訓，負笈海西，精研文字而哀之於家學。每謂余曰；西方作者，無不於誦讀下功夫，一篇之成，必開朗誦會以質正於名家，不意邦人君子，絃誦輟響，乃同廣陵散。吾子以文章有名，盍出一言以正之！余聞之戄然，遂為論桐城家言因聲求氣之法，仲蘇嘗喜其說之有契也！展誦是書，亟發深言，古訓是式，闡以科學，唯英才特達，則炳矅垂文，採故實於前代，觀通變於當今，有倫有脊，懸諸日月焉，乃索余序以明其旨，余謂古人誦與讀異，說文：誦，諷也；讀，籀書也。蓋誦者諷其文辭，讀者簡其義蘊。周禮春官大司樂，以樂語教國子興道諷誦言語。賈公彥註；以聲節之曰誦。孟子日：誦其詩，讀其書。此誦與讀之辨也。後人混誦於讀，操觚率爾，摘文乖張，而不識所調。於是桐城家者出，乃倡因聲求氣之說。長老所傳；劉大櫆絕豐偉，日取古人之文，縱聲讀之。姚鼎則患氣福，然亦不發哦誦；但抑其聲使之下耳！夫文學之興，造端歌謠託風采，散鬱陶，滌暢情性，豈後語妙；而頓挫抑揚，尤重音節。劉大櫆不云乎！神氣者，文之最精處也。音節者，文之稍粗處也。字句者，文之最粗處也。然予謂論文而至於字句，則文之能事盡矣！蓋昔節者，神氣之跡也；字句者，音節之矩也。神氣不可見，於音節見之；音節無可準，以字句準之。音節高，則神氣必高；音節下，則神氣必下。故音節為神氣之跡。一句之中，或多一字，或少一字；一字之中，或用平聲，或用仄聲；同一平字仄字，或用陰平陽平，上聲去聲；則音節迥異。故字句為音節之矩。積字成句，積句成章，積章成篇，合而讀之，音節見矣！歌而詠之，神氣出矣！近人論文不知有所謂音節者，至語以字句，則必笑為末事，此論似高實謬！作文如字句安頓不妙，豈復有文字乎！但所謂字句音節，須從古人文字中寔寔講貫通，始得；非如世俗所云也！夫行文多寡短長，抑揚高下，無一定之律，而有一定之妙；可以意會而不可以言傳。學者求神氣而得之於音節，求音節而得之於字句，則思過半矣！其要只在讀古人文字時，便設以此身代古人說話，一吞一吐，皆由彼而不由我；爛熟後，我之神氣，即古人之神氣；古人之音節，都在我喉吻間，合我喉吻者，便是與古人神氣音節相似處；久之自然鏗鑄發金石聲。此著見大　論文偶記者也。姚鼎得法大　，首唱宗風，嘗　所為古文辭　類，謂劉先生年八十，猶者曰：文章一事，而其所以致美之道非一端。侖意立格，行氣遣辭，理充於中，聲振於外，數者一有不足，則文病矣！作者每意專於所求而遺於所忽，故雖有志於學而卒無以大過乎凡衆。故必用功勤而用心精密，兼收古人之具美，融合於胸中，無所凝滯，則下筆時自無得此遺彼之病也！（見尺牘與陳碩士）深讀久為；自有悟人。夫道德之精微，而觀聖人者，不出動容周旋中禮之事，文章之精妙，不出字句聲色之間，舍此便無可窺尋矣！（見尺牘與石甫姪孫）大抵學古文者，必要放聲疾讀，祇久之自悟；若但能默看，即終身作外行也！（見尺贖與陳碩士）詩古文各要從聲音證入。（同上）文韻致好，但說到中間忽有滯純處，此乃是讀古人文不熟。念讀以求其體勢，緩讀以求其神味，得彼之長，悟吾之短，自有進也！（同上）夫學文者，利病短長，下筆時必知之；更取以與所讀古人文較量得失，無不明了；育其得而究其失，可入古人之室矣！（見尺牘與魯賓之）此　之所以說也。　晚而主鍾山書院講席；門下著籍者，上元有管同，梅曾壳，桐城有方東樹姚瑩，四人者稱為高第弟子，各以所得傳授徒友，往往不絕。而曾亮最老　後死，仕宦京朝。同時為古文者，羣尊之為師；　之薪火，於是烈焉、而會亮之說曰：古文與他體異者，以首尾氣不可斷耳；有二首尾焉，則斷矣！退之謂六朝文雜亂無章，人以為過論。夫上表下裳，相成而不複也，故成章。若衣上加衣，裳下有裳，此所謂無章矣！其能成章者，一氣者也。欲得其氣，必求之於古人；周秦漢及唐宋人文，其佳者皆成誦乃可。夫觀書者，用目之一官而已；誦之而入於耳，益一官矣；且出於口成於聲，而暢於氣。夫氣者，吾身之至精者也：以吾身之至精，御古人之至精，是故渾合而無有間也！（見文集與孫芝房書）羅裏山氏興人論文而自述其讀文之勤，與讀文之法，此世俗以為迂且陋者也！然世俗之文，揚之而其氣不昌，誦之而其聲不文，循之而詞之豐殺厚薄緩急，與情事不相稱，若是者，皆不能善讀文者也！文言之，則昌黎所謂養氣；質言之，則端坐而誦之七八年；明允之言，即昌黎之言也，文人矜夸，或自讀其所得，而示人以微妙難知之詞。明允可謂不自諱者矣！而知而信之者或鮮！臺山氏能信而從之，而所以吿人者，亦如老泉之不自諱；吾雖不獲見其人，其文，固可以安坐而得之矣！（見文集臺山論文書後）湘鄉曾國藩與曾亮同官京朝，以文章相　切，而雄直之氣，宏通之識，一時無兩；至乃亟許於　，列之聖哲書像記，以為粗解文章，由姚先生啟之也。然自明其所以入手之方，則曰：退之論文，先貴沈浸釀那，含英咀華。姬傳先生亦以格律聲色，與神理氣味四者並稱。（見文集復吳之序書）熟讀而强探，長吟而反覆；使其氣若翔翥於虎無之表，共辭跌宕俊邁而不可以方物；抗吾氣以與古人之氣相翕。（見文集復陳太守實箴書）如四書，詩，書，易，經，左傳，昭明文選，李杜韓蘇之詩，韓歐曾王之文，非高聲朗誦，則不能得其雄偉之概；，非密詠恬吟，則不能探其深遠之趣。二者幷進，使古人之聲調，拂拂然若與我之喉舌相習，則下筆時必有句調凑赴腕下，自覺琅琅可誦矣，（見家訓字諭紀澤）蓋所以誥及門者如此；所以詔其子者亦無不如此！門弟子著籍甚衆；獨武昌張裕釗，桐城吳汝綸號稱能傳其學。汝綸之才大，而裕釗則以意度勝。裕釗初謁國藩，國藩為朗誦王安石泰州海陵縣主薄許君墓志銘，聲之抑揚詘折，足以發文之指趣，裕釗言下大悟，自此研討王文，筆端日益精進。而汝綸嘗謂桐城諸老氣淸體潔，海內所宗，獨雄奇瑰瑋之境尙少！曾文正公出而燆之，以漢賦之氣運之，而文體一變，故卓然為一代大家。近時張廉卿又獨得於史記之譎怪；蓋文氣雄俊不及曾，而意思之詭　，辭句之廉勁，亦能自成一家。（見尺牘與姚仲寔）而觀裕釗之所以與汝綸相討究者，則以為：古之論文者，日文以意為主；而詞欲能副其意，氣欲能舉其辭。譬之車然，意為之御，辭為之載，而氣則所以行也。其始在因聲以求氣，得其氣，則意與詞，往往因之而並顯，而法不外是矣！是故契其一，而其餘可以緒引也！蓋曰意，日詞，曰氣，曰法，之數者，非判然自為一事，常乘乎其機而緄同以凝於一；惟其妙之一出於自然而已！自然者，無意於至，而莫不備至；動皆中乎其節，而奠或知其然；日星之布列，山川之流峙；是也。寧惟日蔚然以星山川！凡天地之間之生而成文者，皆未嘗有見其營度而位置之者也。而草不炳，而秩然以從。夫文之至者，亦若是焉而已！觀者因其旣成而求之，而後有某者某者之可言耳！夫作者之亡也久矣；而吾欲求至乎其域，則務通乎其微，以其無意為之，而莫不至也；故必諷誦之深且久，使吾之心與古人訴合於無間，然後能深契自然之妙，而究極其能事。若夫專以沈思力索為事者，固時亦可以得其意，然與夫心凝形釋，冥合於言議之表者，則或有間矣！故姚氏暨諸家因聲求氣之說，為不可易也！吾所求於古人者，由氣而通其意以及其辭與法，而喩乎其深。及吾所自為文，則一以意為主，而辭氣與法胥從之矣！（見文集答吳至父書）自吳汝給以下，傳授心法，莫之或異！而以揆諸仲蘇所論，如車合轍，如符之相契；然後知桐城家言因聲求氣之法，信有建諸天地而不悖，百世以俟聖人而不惑者焉！獨念余二十二歲，客會稽陶杏南先生之江西提法使幕，方刻意為文章，日誦韓文，以為定程，聲琅琅出戶外而陶公不以為可！謂子文畸於剛燥，余嘗病之，而莫知其所由然！而久乃知子之病於誦也！古人文有陽韻，有陰韻。而後之人讀其文者，抗墜抑揚，當隨韻之陰陽而與為翕關。如曾文正公所謂高聲疾讀以暢其氣，恬吟密詠以探其趣。有宜出之噴薄者，有出之吞吐者。亢之則在靑雲之上，抑之則在淵泉之下，夫各有所當也！而子之誦異是！有亢而無抑，有高聲疾讀而無恬吟密詠，有噴薄而無吞吐，大聲噌吰，往而不返；此其所以病也！在易乾之上九，日亢龍有悔。夫文亦猶是也。戒是也。戒之哉！母固我！母張皇！博媿謝其言！三十年運而往，忽忽如昨日事，而陶公之墓木，不啻拱矣！遺言在耳，徒呼負負！於戲！余病於誦，而卒以病余文；此陶公之所致砭也！何足以叙仲蘇之書哉！用特申桐城家言因聲求氣之恉，以與仲蘇相發者而弁於篇。讀「荷包與文化」  無似　　讀過第六期「申報週刊」上魯着先生的「論一折書」，及本刊第九期上淸芬先生的「一本書的自述」以後，知道標點書折扣低落，價錢便宜得出人意想，除出定價提高得可怕這一點玄虛外，也還有那些凄慘的故事存在着。接着冉人先生的「一種不合理的事實」，在本刊第十期上見到，以一個書店從業員的見地，從正規的出版家的立塲，說明書店老闆在「文化」與「荷包」這兩個矛盾衝突之間掙扎着的情形。近來，在第二十期宇宙風的「姑妄言之一欄內，讀到徐日洪先生的「荷包與文化」，也講的這個問題，我想為出一些讀後感。　　徐先生恐怕也和我一樣，不是一位懂得出版界內容的人。他說。。「普通二百面左右的書，少有不賣八毛一塊的。」因此知道書店老闆的荷包裝得飽飽，「但據說中國的作家仍舊是窮愁瞭倒的多，這是一個不應有的矛盾。」其實這個矛盾是不會有的。如果書店老闆的荷包確是裝得飽飽的話，作家的生活也就不至於窮愁潦倒了。如果書店老闆因為「中間書商的代銷剝削」太厲害，去做違法的欺騙作家的偷稅（版稅）行為，那麼作家雖然因為中間書商的「大　純利」而弄得窮愁瞭倒，可是書總該可以多賣出去了。從文化的立塲上講，究竟還是好現象。可惜事實並不如此。徐先生接着說，「今日中國新小說的勢力所以不及七俠五義，濟公傳，姨太太風流史者，因為前者貴而後者便宜。後者何以能便宜？則因揩油翻印者多，且有一折八扣書，稱斤兩拋賣之故也。」可知新小說的確賣不出去，所以作家的窮愁潦倒是活該，書店老闆的印了第一批新小說積存在棧房裏，不敢再印第二批新樓，也是事實。余先生把這種不合理的事實，完全完全歸罪到書店老闆的不肯拿新小說去和揩油翻印的或一折八扣的書競爭賣價，也着實有點寃枉。書店老闆要顧全「文化」的面子，顧全作家的生活，不得不用比優厚的稿費或版稅率，購求較有文化價値的作品，更不得不審愼地編校，精美地印製。在這種種條件之下，二百面左右的書雖不一定要賣八毛一塊，也就不能不賣它個四毛六角。要想去和揩油翻印或一折八扣的東西競爭，還是非失敗不可的。　　「薄利多賣主義」固然因為「一般書店老闆都因久讀經濟學，未能懂得。」可是薄了利不一定能够多賣，多賣的不一定合於文化水準。卽使有那麼一位不怕窮愁潦倒的學者，竭畢生精力寫成一部「莎士比亞研究」，情願無代價地送給書店老　去出版，也把它粗製濫造了起來，定着一折八扣的書價，放在七俠五義，濟公傳，姨太太風流史的隊伍裏去發賣，不見得會比後者多賣了多少。這是因為莎士比亞的影像，在中國一般民衆的腦膜上，沒有七俠五義那樣活躍，濟公那樣神奇，姨太太那樣風流的緣故！所以從文化的立塲講，固然希望書店老闆的荷包問題要從經濟學的見地上去求飽滿；最先還得希望什麼一種人，或者什麼一種團體，或者什麼一種機關（我不大說得明白），起來教訓這一大羣民衆，使他們對於文化的面目，先有一個正確的認識。　　徐先生把「打破此種荷包主義文化」的辦法，想到「惟有把出版事業來國營」這上頭去，眞是一個極經濟，極有效的辦法！卽使把「有關純粹學術研究，而不為書房老闆歡迎之著作，如莎士比亞研究，上古史研究……」者，都變成「官哲學」，「官文學」，我們終究可以有便宜的官書讀了！讓我們耐着心兒等着吧。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　業餘周刊世界智識北冰洋的征服  柱　　北冰洋，因為氣候惡劣，長年在冰天雪地裏，人們不能到達，所以在過去完全是謎樣的神秘世界。有人因為望見北極空中的極光，便說北冰洋是世界北面的盡頭；又有入因為看到那地方是在長期黑暗中，便以為北冰洋的對岸是地獄，說惡人死了就要押解到那裏受罪。在杜多拉地方曾流行着這樣一種傳說：「從戈拉半島到地獄有三百俄里，那是草木不生的極寒地帶。」這便是人們想像中的北冰洋。　　由於北冰洋的神秘，便在歐洲人的心中引起了一個問題：所謂北冰洋，究竟是一個怎樣的世界？為了要解决這個疑問，他們便實行去探險。一五九六年荷蘭人巴倫茲首先冒險到達了北緯七九·四〇度（距北極點七百十三哩）地方，一九〇九年美國人斐亞羅更到達了九〇度的北極正點；隨後還有許多探險家經過北極地方。所謂北冰洋的秘密，因之也就漸漸為人所知道了。　　不過，上述那些北冰洋的探險者？可說完全是在好奇心和風頭欲望的支配下去行探險的，所以結果除知道在北冰洋有鯨魚的噴水，白熊的咆哮以及其他的一些奇異現象外，並未注意到它對於人類生活的意義，當然也就更不會想到怎樣去征服這地方，以幫助人類的生活了。能眞的為了生活的實際目的去探險和征服的，是只有蘇聯國家的有計劃有組織的對於北冰洋的考察，探險和征服。　　當蘇聯人民實行探查北冰洋時，在他們每一個的腦筋中都發生了許多很實際的問題：北冰洋沿岸的地勢和地質如何。除已知的外，北冰洋沿岸遝有沒有新的河流？新的島嶼？過去北冰洋的地圖有沒有錯誤？在北冰洋內有些什麽海獸和魚類？北冰洋沿岸地中埋藏的有些什麽鑛物？怎麽才能通航過北冰洋的大冰流之間？怎樣才能在北冰洋沿岸的冰雪中生活？就在這些實際的疑問之下他們去實行探查北冰洋；而且在這中問，他們是很切實地逐漸解答了這些疑問。　　首先是蘇聯人民需要很多肉類，因此蘇聯國家會努力獎勵人民飼養家畜，有一個時候更特別努力從事於家兎的飼養，但結果還是未能很快地完全滿足這個大的需要。這便給與了征服北冰洋的第一個任務，卽是努力捕取那裏的海獸　　北冰洋的海獸很多，如鯨魚，海豹，海馬；白熊等類差不多隨處皆有。蘇聯卽利用科學方法，有計劃地去捕獲牠們，這不僅在食糧問題的解决中極為重要，而且因此還生產了大量的毛皮，解决了蘇聯人民的禦寒問題。如果沒有大量的海獸的毛皮，那對於在零下三十度或四十度的可怕的寒冷，蘇聯人民便要感到難於對付了。　　其次，在西伯利亞有許多河流流入北冰洋，那些河流沿岸隨處都有很廣大的原始森林，從來未被砍伐；而且寒帶樹木的木質極為細緻堅實，是非常好的建築材料。可是，那些地方的木材不能由西伯利亞鐵道運出，而必要在北冰洋開通汽船的航路才能運出。蘇聯自征服北冰洋後，卽採取科學方法，有計劃地採伐那些地方的森林，並運輸出來。這不僅使蘇聯所最需要的建築材料不感缺乏，而且還可以使它有大量的木材輸往西歐各國。　　同時，蘇聯還逐漸探知了北冰洋沿岸埋藏的有許多鑛物，如石炭和岩鹽等物，眞不知道其藏量有好多，但這些都是將要隨着蘇聯建設的發展而逐漸開發出來給人類享受的。　　最後是在蘇聯征服北冰洋中，把那裏的許多野蠻民族的文化生活也逐漸提高了。這更是表現了它的偉大。　　誰都知道所謂五年計劃是蘇聯努力從事經濟建設的指針，但在五年計劃中，明明白白地有一部分是關於極地和北冰洋的調查，研究和征服。由於這點，便可知道蘇聯對於征服北冰洋的工作是怎樣的注意和努力了。這裏可以舉出最近幾年來蘇聯探查北冰洋的幾决主要航海來——　　一九三〇年碎冰船塞多夫的探險。　　一九三二年碎冰船太木爾，克拉辛和西伯利亞可夫號等的航行曾遇阻碍。　　一九三三年西伯利亞可夫號安全到達目的地。但同年六月下旬却有另一船在巨可特半島附近被陷入冰中；結果幸賴蘇聯人民的努力，將所有人員救了出來。　　以後在一九三四年三五年以及最近，蘇聯都在繼續努力於征服北冰洋的工作，雖然曾遭遇了許多困難和危險。現在，北冰洋沿岸各處都設有飛機根據地和無綫電信局，備有許多捕捉海獸鯨魚的船隻，碎冰船和飛機等，正在努力捕獲各種海獸。至於北冰洋沿岸地下的各種實藏以及那些廣大的森林，當然也是正在被考察，被採伐的。這樣，地獄似的北冰洋，在蘇聯人民努力征服之下，便日益成為對人問最有用的地方了。經濟往來最近世界貿易槪况  夷平　　隨着工業生產的增加，物價的高漲，一向萎縮的世界貿易從去年第三季起也開始有了好轉的徵兆。但是，如果就資本主義各國的個別的情形來說，則貿易的發展是很不平衡的。例如金集團諸國（法國荷蘭瑞士等），就在世界貿易總額開始增加中，其對外貿易仍未有所增加。但是，在已經放棄了金本位的國家，其對外貿易却顯示出了明顯的增加。這我們可以先拿美國來說。　　近年來的美國，由於貨幣貶値，厲行通貨膨脹，使其對外貿易表現出了如决的增加：（單位百萬美元）　　由上表看來，可見美國的對外貿易自一九三四年起卽在開始增加。不過，在道增加中，有一點値得注意，卽是在去年輸出的增加非常微小，比較起輸入的增加來尤其顯示得過少；結果便表現出了去年出超的大减。這是什麽原因呢？除去由於羅斯福實行農產物减產政策，使農產物輸出减少外，那原因之一便是在於國內外市塲縮小，使得就是通貨膨賬政策也不能促逃輸出繼續的大量增加。　　其决是英國。在世界經濟的漸决好轉中，英國是表現得最明顯的國家之一；同樣，它的對外貿易也顯示出了日益增進的狀態。據最近英國商部大臣任錫曼報告，英國在世界的輸出貿易中，一九三二年佔百分之九·九，及至去年便已增至百分之一〇·八了。今年呢，依任氏的分析，則是：「一九三六年開始六個月間與一九三五年相較，雖表示輸出貿易之增加不及近數年之速，但仍有增無减。一九三五年一月至六月輸出總額共値二〇六·五〇〇·〇〇〇鎊，本年同時期中則增至二〇七·九〇〇·〇〇〇鎊；輸入方面增加的程度更較輪出為大，食物飲料及烟草之輸人，由一六六·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊增至一七九·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊，原料及未完全製成之貨品，則由一〇三·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊增為一一九·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊，完全或大半已製成之貨品，則由八八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊增至一〇一·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊左右。輸出方面雖僅增加一·四〇〇·〇〇〇鎊，然不得卽認為完全處於不利之地位；其增進迎綏之原因，一部份係由於對意輸出貿易曾有一時完全陷於停頓，其數額較諸去年上半年計减少四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊。入超之數字，雖由一二四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊增至一六二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊，但不能卽預料本年內將有仟何嚴重之不利的支付均衡。……五這個分析當然不能完全憑信，但近年英國貿易之增進却是事實。至於今年上半年輸出增進　緩的主要原因，那也的確是在於對意輸出的减少；這也許就是英帝國主義急於取消對意制裁，企</p>

<h3>Li Pinxian Arrives in Guangzhou to Meet Chiang; Peaceful Negotiations with the Guangxi Faction Show Progress; Guangxi Troops on the Borders of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Hunan Adopt a Defensive Posture; Li Yangjing Summoned by Chiang to Discuss Important Matters; Shao Xiong Arrives in the Provincial Capital to Meet with Li and Others; Guangxi Air Force Pilots Zheng Zixiang and Others Jointly Issue a Circular Telegram</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Li Pinxian arrived in Guangzhou at 2:00 PM on the 15th via flight number 1001 from Nanning. Huang Xuchu did not accompany him. Li first visited Yu Hanmou and together they went to meet Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang immediately granted them an audience and discussed the peaceful resolution of the Guangxi situation in detail. Gradual progress is being made. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangxi Air Force originally had over 20 aircraft, and recently purchased over 40 more, forming them into three squadrons. They are stationed in Nanning, Guilin, and Liuzhou, with Liuzhou as their base of operations. The air force has about a hundred pilots, and Lin Weicheng remains the commander. Zheng Zixiang led three aircraft that defected to Guangdong, taking off from Liuzhou and arriving in Guangzhou on the evening of the 14th. Afterwards, they jointly issued a circular telegram, stating that Li and Bai were stubbornly preparing for war, pretending to negotiate peacefully, and secretly advocating for resistance. Their envoys were merely being manipulated. The Guangxi authorities initially used resistance against Japan as a pretext, but their deceitful schemes were exposed. They then allied with the Communists for self-preservation, suddenly reversing themselves and inviting their own destruction. Zheng Zixiang and others felt ashamed of this and flew to Guangdong on the 14th, awaiting orders from the Central Government. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Huang Shaoxiong boarded the "Foshan" steamship to the province at 10:00 PM on the 15th. Xu Jing Tang accompanied him. They are expected to arrive on the morning of the 16th to meet Chiang Kai-shek and Li Pinxian. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang is scheduled to leave Hong Kong on the 21st, sailing on the Japanese Empress liner via Shanghai to the United States. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Li Yangjing arrived in the province from Hong Kong on the morning of the 15th. Together with Yu Hanmou, Xiang Hanping, and Chen Cheng, he met with Chiang Kai-shek. Li's arrival was in response to Chiang's summons to discuss important matters. The entire staff of the Military Affairs Commission's Adjutant Office, over 70 people, arrived in Guangzhou on the 5th via the Guangdong Railway. Song Zi Liang also flew from Lushan to Guangzhou on the afternoon of the 5th. (15th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Can the Japan-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact Be Realized?</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>The diplomacy between Japan and Russia has not yet reached a period of liquidation. Although Japanese Foreign Minister Arita has explained on the cabinet seat that the focus of Japan's established foreign policy is towards Russia. Once the troops on both sides of the Japan-Russia border can achieve a state of equilibrium, efforts should be made to conclude a non-aggression treaty and establish demilitarized zones. However, in fact, Foreign Minister Arita's beautiful rhetoric is just like the "universal harmony" policy touted by Hirota when he was Foreign Minister - a promise that will not be fulfilled. Non-aggression treaties have always been the consistent foreign policy of the Soviet Union. In the past, the Soviet Union repeatedly proposed such proposals to Tokyo, but the heads of Sannenzaka in Japan rejected them, and the heads of Kasumigaseki had no choice but to follow suit and reject them as well. Under the guise of conquering the Reds, it masked its aggressive actions on the Asian continent. On the one hand, it increased troops in North China to invade Chahar and eastern Inner Mongolia, and recently plotted behind the scenes to instigate the puppet army of Li Shouxin to occupy eastern Suiyuan. On the other hand, it provoked the puppet army to attack Outer Mongolia. Because Outer Mongolia had long been prepared, its invasion plan could not be realized as desired. However, its ambition to control North China and Inner Mongolia to encircle Soviet Russia on a large scale has not disappeared from the minds of those soldiers who regard bloodshed as their only job and aggression as their only purpose. Under such circumstances, in order to prevent aggression, the Soviet Union must strengthen its military in the Far East. But we must know that the Soviet Union's preparations to strengthen its military in the Far East are defensive rather than aggressive. At the same time, the Soviet authorities are always willing to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Japan. According to the recent remarks made by the Japanese Ambassador to Russia, Ota, after returning to China to speak to reporters, "The Soviet Union has not given up on the proposal for a mutual non-aggression treaty proposed four years ago and may propose it again at any time." Such remarks came from the mouth of a Japanese diplomat, so the key to the worsening of the relationship between Japan and Russia due to the arms race in the Far East is clear to us without thinking.</p>
<p>Therefore, we do not believe that Japan's foreign policy is so-called to maintain peace in the Far East, and Arita's expression of peace this time is only, as some political commentators have pointed out, a feeling that the burden of national defense expenses is too heavy. Maintaining an excessive army and navy without a definite foreign policy is meaningless. Therefore, there is a call for coordination with the United Kingdom and a proposal for a non-aggression treaty with Russia. This expression of posture is more of an internal matter than an external one. In other words, politicians and the military have different views on the expansion of national defense expenses, and it is not that there has been a change in foreign policy. After looking at the military's proposal for a national defense-first policy and the plan for military mobilization, we can know that so-called improving relations with other countries and seeking a basis for cooperation are just window dressing.</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Returns to Beiping from Baoding Yesterday</h3>

The next morning, I inspected the troops of Zhao Dengyu's division and meted out rewards and punishments separately.

<h3>Tianjin Municipality Rectifies Tax Revenue</h3>

<h3>Executive Yuan Passes Seven-Point Measures to Relieve Rice and Wheat Sales</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) President Chiang, based on Yang Yongtai's winter telegram, stated that this year, Hubei Province had no drought in the highlands and no floods in the lowlands, and the harvest of rice, wheat, and all kinds of miscellaneous grains was unusually abundant, the only time since the founding of the Republic. The same was true for Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui. However, low grain prices harm farmers, which is extremely worrying. How to separately devise ways to transport, sell, and store the grain to achieve the effect of adjusting surpluses and deficits should be planned early. He immediately issued an order to Weng Wenhao, Chiang Tingfu, and Wu Dingchang to thoroughly review the matter. The result of the review was that relieving grain prices and adjusting surpluses and deficits is related to the people's livelihood and is of utmost importance. Although there is hope for a bumper harvest of wheat and miscellaneous grains in Hubei Province and other places this year, it does not seem to be a concern for stockpiling and falling prices. As for this year's American wheat, there is a sign of a poor harvest. Wheat prices have been high for months, unprecedented in previous years, which proves that even if the wheat produced domestically increases, sales should not be a concern and the value will not fall. As for the sales of miscellaneous grains, due to strong international market demand, there is still room to increase the amount of exports, so there is no concern about obstruction. The only difficulty is the rice and wheat item. The following relief measures are proposed: (1) Guangdong Province's rice sales association should strive to increase sales in the province. (2) Rice exports from Hunan Province are subject to export passport fees. It has been decided that the passport fees should be waived. (3) For rice transported through the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, the Ministry of Railways should order the railway bureau to adjust the freight rate as needed, so as not to make it too expensive. (4) The quality of rice produced in various places is uneven, and efforts should be made to improve it. All rice transported to Guangdong Province must have factories set up at centralized locations for fine milling. Hunan and Guangdong provinces should jointly draft methods, and the Ministry of Industry should send personnel to inspect. (5) The national army uses a lot of hanging every year, and the competent authorities should purchase the food needed for the whole year in August and September. (6) Existing warehouses in various places should be filled with storage in August and September. (7) The tariff aspect should also be assisted by infant care methods. The above measures have been submitted to the 274th meeting of the Executive Yuan and approved. The order has been issued to the relevant agencies to follow them separately.

<h3>Smuggled Goods from Tianjin Transported and Sold to Various Counties in Southern Hebei</h3>

<h3>Roosevelt Speech: Heartbroken by the International Situation; Treaties are Destroyed, Honor is Disregarded; America Will Not Be Involved in the Vortex of War; Permanent Friendship Lies in Keeping Promises</h3>
<p>(New York) President Roosevelt today gave a sincere and moving speech at the state of New York's Chautauqua, earnestly declaring America's determination not to participate in war. He concluded by saying that he was more concerned about the international situation than the future of American domestic politics, and less happy. International treaties have been violated not only in spirit but also in writing, without regard to pure principles of honor, and countries are helpless. This state of affairs is heartbreaking. The President then recounted the efforts of the United States to assist the international war-ending movement, saying that America's political responsibility to avoid being caught in the vortex of war and eliminate wars in various countries is beyond its power. But at least he can be sure that the United States will never do anything to fuel, cause, or promote war. The conscience of the United States is against war, although, if war breaks out in other countries, it will be seen that there are tens of thousands of money-grubbing people in the United States who hope to destroy or evade America's neutrality. These people will tell you that if this or that product can be made and transported to belligerent countries, American unemployed people can all find work, and America can then seize the world's trade again. Such sophistry is difficult to resist, but if these people choose between money and peace, the American people will answer, "We would choose peace." The US does not seek to control other countries, nor does it have the ambition to open up and distribute land. The US opposes imperialism. The US is willing to reduce armaments. The US is willing to extend the hand of goodwill to all countries in the world. Those who wish to make friends with us may shake our hand. (14th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>State of New York, Chautauqua. President Roosevelt gave a speech here today on American foreign policy, expressing deep anxiety about international peace and the European situation. He said, "In the past few months, I have told visitors that I am very pessimistic about the international situation because I am more concerned about it than domestic problems. Visitors may be surprised by this, but I have participated in war and peace decisions before and after the European War, and I spend a lot of time studying diplomatic problems every day, so this is not an empty statement." The President then recounted the current government's good neighbor policy and the situation in which the countries of the Americas have been led into sincere cooperation, and said that the United States can be on good terms with all countries in the world and in the Americas. However, in recent years, he has become increasingly uneasy about the trends in the majority of countries in other continents. International treaties are arbitrarily destroyed, and there is no trust between countries. This is truly regrettable. In short, permanent friendship can only be achieved if all countries in the world keep their promises. The United States has always supported the international anti-war movement and has always resolved to participate in disarmament conferences. As for naval disarmament conferences, the United States only concluded naval qualitative restriction agreements with Britain and France after general treaty signing became hopeless. This agreement is now gradually losing its effect. I hope that America's economic policy can abolish all trade barriers and eliminate war. We believe that if there is no free trade between countries, it will eventually lead to war. We are willing to shake hands with any country and deeply hope that all countries can cooperate with us. After the President finished his speech, he boarded a car to continue his inspection of Ohio, New York, and Pennsylvania, and finally to Harrisburg to discuss disaster relief measures with the governors of the Eastern states.

<h3>The Japanese National Policy Issue: Proposals from Various Ministries Have Concluded; Military and Finance to Negotiate in the Coming Days; Army Budget Reaches 800 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of Finance Baba has been meeting with ministers from various provinces for days, listening to the national policy proposals submitted by each province and the content of major new projects. At the same time, they exchanged various opinions. Now that this work has come to a conclusion, it is scheduled to start next week to meet with Minister of the Army Terauchi and Minister of the Navy Nagano to listen to the content of the budgets of the two ministries and the opinions of the Army and Navy on national policy issues. Then, the specific review of each national policy, and its acceptance or rejection, etc. will begin. However, because there is a lack of consensus within the cabinet regarding the handling of national policy guidelines, it is still doubtful whether this work of the Minister of Finance can proceed smoothly. In the meantime, there have been interventions and efforts by Fujinuma, Toda, Yoshida, and Mi, but in the end, there will inevitably be some twists and turns. (15th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The preparation for national policy and new requirements for next year, which was held among cabinet members other than Minister of Finance Baba and the military leaders, regarding the preliminary work for deciding important national policies, was completed on the 14th. Therefore, on the morning of the 15th, Chief Cabinet Secretary Fujinuma visited Minister of Finance Baba to listen to the process of the negotiation and the whole picture of the fiscal authorities' revenue plan. He immediately reported the results to Prime Minister Hirota. Minister of Finance Baba will meet with Prime Minister Hirota around the regular cabinet meeting on the 18th. The government's national policy to be adopted for the new policies of general administration has been generally outlined. After the submission of the budget estimates of the Army and Navy on the 17th and 18th, the ministers of the Army and Navy will begin preliminary negotiations on the defense budget. Starting next week, the financial authorities of the Army, Navy, and Treasury will review the national defense budget, considering the cost of national defense and the expenses required for the new policies of general administration. The important national policy items to be implemented from next year will be decided after consultation between the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance. (15th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of Finance Baba is about to hold important talks with the military ministries regarding the preliminary work for deciding important national policies and the new policies of general administration. The Navy hopes that in the midst of the rampant national policies, in addition to strengthening national defense, it also hopes that important national policies such as fuel national policy, aviation national policy, shipping national policy, and resource national policy will be implemented as soon as possible. In particular, the relevant authorities have already reached a consensus on the fuel national policy and the shipping national policy. When the four national policy proposals are brought to the cabinet meeting, Minister of the Navy Nagano will strongly support them, supporting Minister of Commerce Ogawa and Minister of Communications Torimotoki. Therefore, the speech of Minister of the Army Terauchi will also be noted. (15th Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army plans to submit the budget estimates for next year on the 15th and 16th. However, it is difficult to separate next year from the first half of the second national defense enhancement, that is, the six-year plan from next year to the 17th year. Therefore, it is also necessary to submit the annual allocation of the six-year plan together. Therefore, it is impossible to submit on the scheduled date, and it is feared that it will be difficult to submit within the next week. Therefore, the total amount of the budget estimate for next year is still unknown. However, no matter how much it is reduced, it is generally feared that it will be more than 800 million yuan. (15th Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The chairman of the Electricity Association, Yoshizo Ikeo, president of Nippon Electric Power, visited the director of the Army Affairs Bureau, Isotani, at the Ministry of the Army on the morning of the 15th, and stated various objections to the nationalization of electricity for two hours. Director Isotani, from the perspective of national defense, clearly expressed his support for the nationalization of electricity, saying that the control of electricity should always be nationalized when considering war. Furthermore, considering the fuel problem, the electricity problem should also follow the principle of "perpetual master, auxiliary fire." Among those who oppose it, there is a saying based on national socialism for state-run electricity, but in this point, it is absolutely not allowed. Therefore, the military, from the perspective of national defense, has gone on to support the state-run plan. When it is implemented, the military hopes that the government and the people will work together to reduce its drawbacks. Director Isotani's statement that the military is responsible is particularly noteworthy. (15th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) From the standpoint of self-sufficiency in raw materials, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs has decided to increase subsidies to the Japan-Manchukuo Cotton Assistance Association and the Japan-Manchukuo Sheep Association in order to promote the development of the cotton and sheep industries in Korea and Manchuria. Furthermore, 700,000 yuan is included in the budget for next year as a new requirement to be submitted to the Ministry of Finance. However, in order for the Japan-Manchukuo Cotton Association to achieve the 25-year plan for the North China cotton industry, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs has decided to establish the North China Cotton Association. Therefore, it will soon contact relevant business operators in Osaka to prepare for its implementation. (15th Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>

Although the rebel army had entered the town, the 35,000 defenders were still fighting to the death, fighting hand-to-hand with the rebel army in the streets, fighting and retreating. The correspondent stood on the international bridge at the border and saw communists being killed 200 yards away. Behind him, thick smoke and flames rose. In the scorching sun, the two armies were still fighting each other desperately, and the dead were piled up. Badajoz had become a large cemetery for the defenders at that time. Thousands of refugees from the city fled into Portugal. They all escaped from death. The Portuguese authorities are transporting medicines and food for relief. After the rebel army captured Badajoz, they are now attacking San Sebastian and Malaga. Rebel aircraft dropped bombs in the sky over San Sebastian. It is reported that eight captured rebels in the town have been shot to retaliate. Rebel planes also bombed Malaga. Seven hundred Moroccan soldiers are carrying artillery and advancing towards it. It is said that they have defeated the government army and killed 160 people. At the same time, the government army is also fiercely approaching the towns of Oviedo and Cordoba. It is said that they have also surrounded the town of Granada. Although the rebel army is fiercely attacking the town of Taidian, the government army is gradually approaching the town of Huesca.

<p>Lisbon According to news received here, the historically famous Spanish city of Badajoz, located near the Portuguese border, was attacked by the rebel army and captured after street battles in the city. The rebel army carried out a fierce bombing before occupying the city, causing great damage to the city. Later, a big fire followed, turning the city into scorched earth. The rebel planes that dropped bombs over the city could be seen from Elvas in Portugal. There are now thousands of refugees who have fled from the city of Badajoz and are taking refuge in the town. A Spanish government army officer, who escaped to Portugal, told people about the horror of the bombing, saying that most of the victims were women and children. The rebel army that occupied the city belonged to the southern troops under the command of the rebel leader General Franco. When the rebel army entered the outer city of Badajoz, they passed through the historic Detoni Gate, and then the two armies fought fiercely in the streets under the scorching sun. The rebel army won and then attacked the inner city of Badajoz. The defending government army numbered more than 35,000 and rose up to resist. The two sides then engaged in close combat. The head of the civil administration in the area fled to Portugal before the city fell and is now suffering from heart disease and is being treated in the hospital and has vowed not to return to Spain.

<p>Madrid Government and rebel forces engaged in fierce battles throughout the country today. The cruelty of the war has disregarded humanitarian principles. The major battle locations include (1) Malaga, (2) San Sebastian, (3) the area near the Portuguese border, (4) northeast of Charagosa, (5) Teruel Province, (6) Oviedo. There were also small battles in other places, with many deaths and injuries. Battles in various places are about to turn into a final showdown. The government authorities today felt even more panicked due to the fall of Badajoz on the Portuguese border. (14th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>Burgos After the revolutionary army captured the provincial capital of Badajoz, the southern army led by General Franco and the northern commander Mola have made contact in Merida. After the two armies join forces, they will begin a flanking operation with the city of Madrid as their destination. According to a statement issued to our reporter by the revolutionary army authorities here, the fact that the north and south routes of the revolutionary army have made contact is the most important achievement since the start of the war. General Franco and General Mola met in Seville yesterday to formulate future operational plans. The end of the war is not far away. (15th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Battle for the North Begins; Rebel Army Attacks San Sebastian; Air Force and Artillery Bombard Fiercely</h3>
<p>Hendaye, France It is learned here that the rebel army headquarters in northern Spain has decided to order an attack on the port of San Sebastian today. This morning, the Spanish government army and the rebel army in the north used air force and artillery to bombard fiercely. The government army also continuously opened fire, bombarding the rear of the rebel army, hoping to prevent reinforcements from coming to help. The rebel army sent two planes to bomb the city of Irun six times. From this, it can be seen that the two armies have already started a decisive battle. Which side controls the north will be determined in this battle. (15th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Hendaye, France A column of the rebel army in northern Spain, departing from the town of Voyesen, attacked the city of Irun starting at 4:00 this morning and engaged in fierce fighting with the government army. Several rebel army planes, departing from the city of Burgos to help in the battle, bombed the sky over the government army's battle line, which stretched for ten kilometers. On the government army side, 1,000 new reinforcements arrived from the port of Bilbao and immediately launched a counterattack, using machine guns to strafe and artillery fire from the fortresses of San Marcos and Guagalupe to help. After six hours of fierce fighting, the rebel army suffered heavy losses and retreated. By noon, the area around the city of Irun had returned to calm. (15th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid There was a big thunderstorm in the Guadarrama Mountains north of the capital yesterday. The government army and the rebel army had to temporarily cease their activities. After the rain stopped, the whole area resumed artillery fire. The two sides sent multiple planes to drop bombs. The artillery fire was unprecedentedly fierce, but as a result, there were no changes in the positions of the two armies. This morning, the two armies were actively consolidating their transportation lines in the rear to ensure that troop transport and supply were not threatened by the enemy. (15th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Rebel Army Advances on All Routes; Refugees Flee into Portugal</h3>
<p>Lisbon Regarding the situation of the Spanish war, the rebel army made great progress today, especially in the city of Badajoz, which is adjacent to the Portuguese border, which has been captured by the rebel army. The situation in the province of Malaga on the Mediterranean coast is also quite favorable for the rebel army. Regarding the fall of the city of Badajoz, according to a telegram from our special correspondent, the army entered the city of Badajoz at 6:45 p.m. today. Earlier, at 7:00 this morning, the rebel army began to attack with the air force and artillery. Suddenly, the sound of artillery was deafening, and the rain of bullets was fierce. The attack was suspended at 11:00 a.m., and a fierce attack was resumed at 5:00 p.m. Then, the army attacked to the foot of the city wall, where there were only ruins and rubble. Three hundred members of the government army's militia and five hundred members of the Popular Front army relied on several piles of rubble and still made a final stand, but they could not hold out, and the rebel army rushed into the city. This was one of the first teams to enter the city. The government army retreated to the area of the ancient fortress and was still firmly defending under heavy artillery fire. As of the time of the reporter's telegram, the government army was still fighting to the death, and the street fighting in the city had not yet ended. At the same time, the San Cristobal artillery fort outside the city was also occupied by the rebel army. It is expected that the remnants in the city will be cleared up sooner or later.</p>
<p>In addition, there was no development in the war news near Madrid today. The report issued by the rebel army's radio station in Seville only stated that after the fall of the city of Badajoz, the troops of General Commander Franco and Northern Commander Mola had made contact. Therefore, the city of Madrid is becoming increasingly threatened. As for the situation in Aragon Province in the northeast, according to news from our special correspondent in the front line in Barcelona, Spain, the city of Huesca, which is occupied by the rebel army, is now under pressure from the government army and is very tight. Rebel Commander Mola, in order to reduce the pressure on the city and disperse the government army's forces, recently launched a large-scale attack on the city of Te Dian with infantry, artillery, and air force, intending to occupy it. As a result, there was no progress, and two planes were shot down by the government army. Two drivers were killed on the spot. On the province of Guipuzcoa in the north, the rebel army is currently intensifying its pressure on the city of San Sebastian and launching an offensive against the port of Pasajes in order to gain a passage to the sea. Furthermore, the cruiser General Severiano and multiple planes are launching a fierce bombardment on the port of Santurtzi, but no major damage has been caused. After the city of San Sebastian was bombed by rebel planes, 27 civilians in the city were injured and 7 died. Among them were a woman, two young girls (one 17 years old and one only 14 years old), and a child, whose legs were blown off and died instantly, which was a terrible sight. Another bomb fell near the hospital, but did not cause damage to the hospital or the military situation in the area. The rebels who were traveling north along the Golden River Bank Avenue from the city of Torosa have stopped at the city of Villabona and have not advanced. The food needed by the government army has been transported from the city of Bilbao in the west for supply. They are currently holding their positions firmly so that they will not be careless. (14th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid The latest scene in the Spanish civil war is that the government army and the rebel army have each won and lost, and the war is still going on fiercely. According to official announcements, the government army has occupied Pozo Blanco, 30 miles north of Cordoba. The place is a center for industry in Spain and has 15,000 residents. Two hundred city guards who joined the rebel army in the area have been captured and imprisoned. The rebels around Cordoba have all been cleared. A government army column is currently awaiting orders to occupy the town. At the same time, the rebels attacked twice from Larina, but as a result, the government army has retreated to Guadiaro, near the port of Estepona in the province of Malaga. The rebels claim that they have now occupied four villages and are currently approaching the port of Estepona. They also claim that the government army has lost 170 men in the area and has lost 7 machine guns, 50 rifles, and 100 boxes of ammunition, all of which were captured by the revolutionary army. It is heard that the government army has invaded the capital of the province of Oviedo, Oviedo, and is currently engaged in fierce street fighting. (14th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Rebel General Denies Restoration</h3>
<p>Barcelona Rebel leaders Generals Cabanellas and Mola issued a statement to the Associated Press today, denying that the monarchy would be restored after the victory of the revolutionary army, saying that they all advocated organizing a strong civil government, and that they all faithfully believed in republicanism. Mola said, "I am determined to rebuild Spain and severely punish the assassination party. They are our enemies. The current government conspired to stage a coup on July 30 to replay the tragedy of Soviet Russia, but fortunately the people were able to rise up and put down this conspiracy."

<h3>The Spanish Civil War: Is it Really So Cruel? What is the Guilt of the People? Corpses Pile Up</h3>
<p>(London) The news received today from various places has mentioned the terrible situation of the Spanish civil war. Badajoz was occupied by the rebel army last night. Although journalists are not allowed to go there yet, it is rumored that after the city fell, anyone suspected of supporting the left-wing Popular Front was gathered in one place and executed. There have been many such tragedies. The situation in San Sebastian is even more tragic. The residents' lives are in danger at any time. When the rebel army attacks, they are ordered to be held hostage in the city to pay for their sins. Once, the rebel army launched an air raid. A young child in the city had his feet blown off by a bomb. The city's defenders immediately took out an old man who was being held hostage from the prison and executed him as revenge. "Long live explosives" has now become the slogan of the extreme government supporters, most of whom are miners. They have threatened that rather than surrendering the city, they would rather raze the entire city to the ground. This kind of intimidation theory is even more frightening because the city has a large number of explosives and more than 2,000 miners who are determined to die have come from Bilbao to reinforce it. Although hundreds of Spanish nobles have been imprisoned in the cargo ship "Pelayo" in the port of San Sebastian as hostages, the city's defenders still believe that there are too few hostages, so they have launched a large-scale seizure of the entire city today, without distinction, and have obtained more than 500 people and imprisoned them in another cargo ship. Both ships are fully loaded with explosives, and they have declared that if the rebel army bombards the city, the two ships will be blown up as a threat. (15th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Madrid: US Embassy to Close; Warns American Citizens to Leave Immediately</h3>
<p>(Washington) The State Department received news today that the US Chargé d'Affaires in Spain, Winterling, has warned 186 American citizens in Madrid that if they do not leave the city immediately, they must bear the responsibility for the danger. If the situation worsens, the US Embassy may have to close. (15th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>England Expresses Firm Support for Non-Intervention Agreement; Germany and Italy Remain Cold; Portugal Agrees Conditionally</h3>
<p>(London) The Foreign Office issued a public statement today with firm language, declaring that the British government will fully support France's efforts to implement non-intervention in the Spanish civil war. Britain is prepared to ban the export of armaments to any party as soon as an agreement is reached with all relevant countries, and will take all possible measures to prevent the supply of civilian aircraft. As of now, the following countries have indicated their willingness to join the non-intervention agreement or have already banned the export of armaments to Spain: France, England, Belgium, Russia, Norway, Denmark, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland, totaling more than ten countries. Germany and Italy have yet to provide a final response. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) The Foreign Office recently issued a public statement regarding the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish civil war, which stated: "The French government is currently working to conclude a non-intervention agreement, whereby the countries most closely involved mutually agree not to intervene in the Spanish civil war. The British government fully supports France in this endeavor, and has informed the French government that once the agreement is established, Britain will ban the shipment of armaments to any warring party in Spain, and will take all possible measures to prevent the transport of civilian aircraft to Spain. It is hoped that other relevant countries will reach an agreement on these measures in the near future. To date, the government has not issued any licenses permitting the shipment of armaments and ammunition to Spain (a 1931 order stipulates that all arms exports require a license). This should also be stated in passing. It should be understood that if the unfortunate events within Spain are to be prevented from spreading elsewhere and causing serious repercussions, a strictly impartial attitude must be adopted. If our citizens assist the Spanish government or rebels in any way, whether on land, at sea, or in the air, they will not only be exposed to extreme danger but also undermine the establishment of the non-intervention agreement, thus running directly counter to the government's objectives. Even if they encounter difficulties, the government will not provide assistance." (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) It has been learned here that Italy's intervention in the Spanish civil war was decided before the rebellion by the Spanish rebels. Currently, Italy seems to be insisting on the two reservations it has proposed. Furthermore, Germany has not yet responded to the draft non-intervention agreement proposed by France. In light of the above facts, the British side has deep doubts about the possibility of establishing a non-intervention agreement. The Foreign Office therefore issued a public statement this morning, declaring that it will fully support France's position, in order to urge Germany and Italy to change their attitudes. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Lisbon: The Portuguese government issued a diplomatic note today, accepting the principle of non-intervention in the Spanish civil war proposed by the French government. The note strongly condemned the ferocity of the Spanish civil war and the cruel methods used by the anarchists, and called on other governments to be aware of the danger that the war may spread to Portuguese territory. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Lisbon: Regarding the proposal of non-intervention in the Spanish civil war put forward by France, Portugal has submitted separate responses to Britain and France, the content of which can be divided into four points: (1) Portugal agrees in principle with the French proposal; (2) The implementation of the non-intervention agreement should be absolute in nature, otherwise it will be worthless; (3) The French proposal is most relevant to countries that manufacture and sell armaments to other countries. Portugal is not a country that manufactures armaments, and can therefore only try to prevent other countries' armaments from being transshipped to Spain. However, if other countries comply with the non-intervention agreement, such transshipment will not occur; (4) The revolutionary movement in Spain poses a greater threat to Portugal than to other countries. Therefore, Portugal may have to bear a greater responsibility for safeguarding its own security. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the draft non-intervention agreement in the Spanish civil war proposed by France, the government has recently received responses from the governments of Portugal, Sweden, and Switzerland. Portugal's reply stated that it is prepared to join the draft agreement proposed by France, and has notified the British government of this intention. Sweden's reply also stated that it is prepared to join the agreement, and that it has already issued a ban prohibiting the shipment of armaments to Spain. However, before signing the agreement, the Swedish government reserves the right to study the final version of the agreement in detail. It also believes that the measures proposed in the draft agreement should be implemented universally by all relevant countries in order to be effective. The Swiss government, as a permanently neutral country, has notified France that it cannot participate in the non-intervention agreement. However, it stated that it has already banned the shipment of armaments to Spain, and that Swiss citizens and foreign residents in Switzerland are not allowed to go to Spain to participate in the war on the side of either warring party, with the exception of Spanish residents returning to their country. Furthermore, all propaganda activities that show favor to either warring party have been strictly prohibited. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<h3>Portugal Protests to Spain; Will Organize Volunteer Teams to Rescue Detained Overseas Chinese, But is Prevented</h3>
<p>Lisbon: The Portuguese government has issued a strong protest to the Spanish government through its chargé d'affaires in Madrid today, due to the fact that Spanish militias have crossed into the Portuguese border and plundered the property of Portuguese citizens. The Portuguese government is also demanding compensation for the losses. The Portuguese government has also requested the release of five detained Portuguese overseas Chinese. It is rumored that Portuguese people may secretly organize volunteer teams and enter Spanish territory to rescue the detained Portuguese overseas Chinese. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Lisbon: Yesterday, several Spanish militiamen drove two trucks filled with weapons and crossed the border into the Portuguese territory of Campo Maior. Portuguese soldiers spotted them and impounded the trucks. The militiamen fled back into Spanish territory. Before long, they returned armed and threatened to take back the trucks. The Portuguese soldiers opened fire on them, and the militiamen fled again. The government has protested this matter to the Spanish government. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Lisbon: Since the province of Badajoz in Spain was captured by the revolutionary army, hundreds of refugees have fled into Portuguese territory for safety.

<h3>Cruiser Destroyed by a 500-Kilogram Bomb</h3>
<p>Burgos: Regarding the sinking of the government army cruiser "Jaime I" near the port of Málaga by a rebel plane, our correspondent has learned that the rebel plane was a giant three-engine aircraft that dropped a single 500-kilogram bomb, which split the "Jaime I" in two. The ship sank immediately. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>Moroccan Rebels Pouring into Spain; Four Aircraft Fly Back and Forth Several Times a Day</h3>
<p>Tangier: The rebel authorities in the capital of Spanish Morocco, Tetouan, are currently using four aircraft to transport soldiers across the sea to fight in mainland Spain. Each aircraft flies back and forth several times a day. To date, it is estimated that more than 15,000 soldiers have been transported to southern Spain. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Rabat, North Africa: Informed sources have provided an analysis of the organization of the Spanish Moroccan army, which is worth noting. According to them, the army can be divided into three categories: one is the Spanish army, generally referred to as the garrison army, which is numbered; one is the foreign legion, called the Tercio, which is named in memory of the soldiers under the command of the medieval Spanish Emperor Charles II, and includes infantry, artillery, engineering, and air force units, each unit divided into three battalions; one is the indigenous army, which is further divided into two types: one is called the regular army, whose weapons and equipment are the same as those of the Spanish garrison army, and the other is composed of the Mehal-la tribesmen, whose weapons and equipment are not uniform. The indigenous army could originally join the foreign legion, but conflicts arose from time to time due to ethnic differences. Therefore, all indigenous troops in the foreign legion were reorganized into the regular army. Before the outbreak of the uprising, the total number of troops in the area was 40,000. However, since the outbreak of the war, General Franco has offered high rewards for recruitment, and new recruits can receive a salary of two and a half pesetas per day, which is equivalent to five French francs. Therefore, many indigenous people from all over the area have enlisted, and many indigenous people from the border of French Morocco have also crossed the border to join. The current number of troops is probably more than 40,000. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>Both Armies Take a Strong Stance; Oppose Mediation by a Certain Country</h3>
<p>Seville: General Dávila, commander of the rebel army in the south, recently issued a radio broadcast, stating that the reason why the capital Madrid has not yet been captured is only due to strategic considerations. As for the rumor that a certain country will mediate between the rebel army and the Madrid government, this is an act of intervention and is absolutely impossible. In summary, the Marxists and communists must surrender. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The rumor from Lisbon that the Spanish government has invited a certain country to mediate with the revolutionary army is untrue. The Spanish government is determined to quell the rebellion and will not compromise with the rebels in any way. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Pacific Council to Open in America on Saturday</h3>
<p>Yosemite, California: The Pacific Council is scheduled to open this Saturday in the national park here. Representatives from all countries along the North Pacific, except Mexico, will attend the conference. Representatives from China, the United States, Japan, and Russia will be invited to explain their Pacific policies. Representatives from various countries have been studying the United States' policies for two years, so they will definitely have detailed agendas and questions to inquire about the United States' policies. The preliminary agenda and discussions will first discuss the New Deal implemented by the United States, and study the theory of the New Deal and its impact on the United States and other Pacific countries, as well as the differences between the New Deal and the United States' past Far East policies. Regarding finance, it has been decided to first discuss the extent to which the U.S. government's monetary policy affects the banking industry and investment issues, and its impact on other Pacific countries. Regarding this section, the following questions have been drafted: (1) The political reasons for the U.S. silver purchase plan; the impact of the plan on China's finances, to be answered in detail by U.S. representatives. Finally, questions will be raised from a purely financial standpoint to study the international relations that the United States' investment in Pacific countries may cause. The issues specifically raised for discussion at this conference are divided into four categories: (1) The U.S. participation in the International Silver Agreement; (2) The U.S. attitude towards currency stability; (3) The U.S. reciprocal trade policy; (4) The protection of foreign investment and commercial rights. The second step will be to study whether the U.S. recovery plan has any changes to the Pacific and Far East policies. Many questions have been drafted and sent to members for research in preparation for public meetings. The first question is to study the impact of U.S. trade policies on China, Japan, Russia, Canada, and other Pacific countries. The second question is to study the U.S. government's international trade policy. Is China still the foundation of the U.S. economy? If so, the U.S. attitude towards Japan's monopoly of the Chinese market will be discussed. In addition, the economic losses suffered by the United States after Japan created "Manchukuo" and the U.S. attitude towards Japan's future expansion of power in the Far East will also be discussed. The council will finally discuss the U.S. Pacific policy in the future, and the points discussed are as follows: (1) The U.S. construction of the Pacific Fleet; (2) Philippine independence; (3) Maintaining the U.S. naval and military bases in the Philippines. After the discussion of each issue is completed, the political and economic programs suitable for the United States and the ways of collective action that the United States is willing to participate in will be considered.

<h3>Soviet Russia Schedules Trial for Anti-Government Case; More Than Ten People Involved in the Trotskyist Faction</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs discovered that this year there were several terrorists belonging to the Trotsky-Zinoviev group who, under the orders of Trotsky and under the guidance of the joint Trotsky-Zinoviev organization, attempted to use terrorist means to deal with the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party.

<h3>Travel Journal of Japan (10) (4)</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter, Hu Zhongchi, Hu Yizang</p>
<p>(9) Nara and the Great Buddha</p>
<p>We stayed in Osaka for three nights and then went to Nara, a famous tourist city located between Osaka and Kyoto.</p>
<p>At 8:30 in the morning, we boarded a train at Osaka Station and transferred to a railway car at Tennoji. This train was a slow one, and the third-class section was packed with people, but there were only four of us in the second-class car. The facilities in second and third class were not very different. The seats were all covered with green velvet. The second-class was blue, and the third-class was green. There were no tables between the seats, but the backrests of the second-class seats could be turned in either direction. Our train passed through the stations of Kudara and Hirano, leaving Osaka City and traveling through the countryside. After a few more stations, we could see Mount Shigi and many vineyards from the train window. Then, we passed through the dark and gloomy Shiba-yama Tunnel and crossed the small iron bridge over the Tatsuta River. Soon, we arrived at Nara Station.</p>
<p>On a street in front of the station, there were several purely Japanese-style inns. One of them had a rather large statue of an old man riding a deer at the entrance, which caught our attention, so we went into that inn. The "waitress" led us upstairs. We rested for a while in a room with eight tatami mats and had a meal. A Japanese woman carried a wooden stacked box and came to the door of the room. She knelt down and showed us the items in the stacked box one by one, including small handkerchiefs with landscape prints, cigarette holders made of deer antlers, and various small toys, such as lead-cast sacred deer and bronze Buddha heads. She said, "These are local specialties of Nara. Please buy some, gentlemen." We casually picked out a few items and bought them, and then the woman thanked us and left.</p>
<p>We spent the entire afternoon touring Nara Park.</p>
<p>This park area occupies one-fourth of the entire area of Nara City and has many famous historical sites. All the natural scenery evokes a light and refreshing mood. Many deer, large and small, wandered around the lawn and seemed very friendly to the tourists. As long as you held deer crackers in your hand, the deer nearby would gather around you.</p>
<p>In Nara Park, we visited Kofuku-ji Temple, the Imperial Museum, Todai-ji Temple, Kasuga Taisha Shrine, and the Manyo Botanical Garden.</p>
<p>Kofuku-ji Temple was founded in the 8th century and rebuilt in the 15th century. All the wood of the buildings was not painted. At the top of the temple gate and hall gate, there were several wooden boards hanging side by side. The wooden boards were covered with white paper full of Chinese characters, some of which were handwritten by elementary school students who had visited the temple. We were used to seeing gilded plaques, and we could not help but feel a very simple and rustic feeling there. There is a five-story pagoda in the temple, which is said to be the second tallest pagoda in Japan. The shadow of the pagoda is reflected in the nearby Sarusawa Pond, where many carp and turtles are constantly jumping on the surface of the water.</p>
<p>The foundation stone of the stone lantern in front of the five-story pagoda is said to be a relic from the Tenpyo era in the 8th century. Several bronze and wood-carved Buddha statues in the temple are also remnants from the time when the temple was rebuilt hundreds of years ago and still preserve the artistic style of the Tenpyo era. All of this, together with the entire architecture of Kofuku-ji Temple, has been designated as a national treasure by the Japanese government and is very well protected. The Japanese spirit of cherishing ancient art is truly admirable. Unfortunately, some people change their minds once they arrive in our country. We have repeatedly heard that Japanese people, because the Chinese customs prohibits the export of antiques, try to cut off the heads and arms of stone Buddhas in Yungang and other places and smuggle them out. If the Japanese promotion of Confucianism is not deceiving, then I hope they will remember Confucius' old saying, "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself."</p>
<p>The Imperial Museum is a white, single-story Western-style building. We bought tickets and went in. Most of the works of art displayed here are entrusted by ancient shrines and temples in Nara Prefecture. The exhibition hall is divided into thirteen rooms. The first, second, and third rooms display sculptures. The fourth to eighth rooms display Buddhist implements, weapons, armor, and other fine and applied arts. The ninth to twelfth rooms mainly display paintings. The thirteenth room displays gagaku and ancient documents. Several major exhibits are accompanied by detailed explanatory notes. Representative masterpieces of painting and sculpture from the Asuka, Hakuho, Tenpyo, Fujiwara, and Kamakura periods of Japan can be found there. While visiting, we saw a painter wearing an old black felt hat meticulously copying a hand of an ancient wooden Buddha statue in front of it. From this, it can be seen that this type of museum is of great help to the development of Japanese art.</p>
<p>In the park, what interested us most was Todai-ji Temple, where the largest Buddha in Japan is located. This is a large temple founded by Emperor Shomu of Japan 1,200 years ago and rebuilt several times. The magnificent temple gate is flanked by wooden statues of Kongo Rikishi, the work of the great sculptors Unkei and Tankei of the Kamakura period. The two stone lions inside the gate are said to have been made by the famous stonemason Chen Heqing, who came from China during the Song Dynasty. We went in through the gate along the approach. We bought a Great Buddha viewing ticket next to the wooden railing and went to the Great Buddha Hall. The magnificence of this wooden Buddha hall is boasted by the Japanese as the first in the world. It was rebuilt in 1709 and adopted the architectural style of Tenjiku, which was introduced from China. The seated statue of the copper-cast Rushana Buddha in the hall is more than 16 meters high, and the face is about 5 meters long, and the eyes are about 1.2 meters long. Looking at it, it is indeed amazing. The Japanese say that this is the largest bronze statue in the world, and it is probably not wrong to say that it is large. This Great Buddha is said to have been established by Emperor Shomu of Japan. After two military disasters, the Buddha's body was burned in a raging fire, and it was later completely recast. A part of the Buddha's knees and the lotus petals on which it sits are still left over from the time of its founding. The ground behind the Great Buddha is very spacious. A square hole is dug in a large pillar on the east side. It is said that children who crawl through it can be blessed by the Great Buddha. In addition to the Great Buddha Hall, there are several halls and a large bell tower in the temple that express ancient Japanese art. The bell tower was rebuilt in the Kamakura period. The large bronze bell inside is 4 meters high and has a diameter of 2.7 meters. It is one of the three major bells in Japan.</p>
<p>After leaving Todai-ji Temple, we unknowingly walked to Wakakusa Mountain. This round mountain top is the forepeak of Mount Kasuga. The mountain is covered with green grass, as smooth as a carpet. Ropes are placed at the foot of the mountain, with wooden signs firmly attached. According to the text on the wooden sign, each person must pay ten sen to climb the mountain. The small food shops facing the mountain have built plank beds covered with mats at the foot of the mountain for tourists to rest. We stopped there for a while and then walked along the mountain path. Soon, we saw the large torii gate of Kasuga Taisha Shrine. This type of archway is found in front of all shrines in Japan and can be said to be one of the typical features of Japan. After passing through the torii gate, we came to the approach, with many stone lanterns arranged on the left and right, all the way to the front of the shrine. This shrine is dedicated to the four gods who founded Japan. A cloth curtain with chrysanthemum patterns hangs at the top of the shrine gate. We walked around the corridor of the shrine and then circled around the scattered houses. Then, we went out from the mountain path next to it. It was already dusk at that time. We heard continuous trumpet sounds, and then we saw countless deer running in teams into a fence gate. It turned out that that place was the sacred deer breeding farm. All the deer scattered in the park would return to the team as soon as they heard the trumpet blowing.</p>
<p>On the way back, we also visited the Manyo Botanical Garden. This garden was established in recent years to commemorate the famous Japanese poet Manyo. More than 150 species of flowers, plants, bamboo, and trees that were sung in Manyo poems are planted in the garden. There is a pond with several kinds of waterfowl swimming in it.</p>
<p>We can say that we have visited all the main tourist attractions belonging to Nara Park. Small stalls are set up everywhere on the main roads of these tourist attractions, selling Nara's famous products: deer antlers, wooden plates, Great Buddha cakes, bamboo canes, pens, ink, and all kinds of small toys. Many of these goods are clearly handmade. This makes us think that the handicraft industry in Japan is not declining due to the progress of machinery, but is developing in another way due to the government's promotion of farmers' side businesses.</p>

<h3>After Pseudo-Army Invades Sui, Pingdi Spring Is Extremely Stable; Pingdi Spring Is the Military Center; Zeng Yanyi and Others Lead Troops to Sit and Guard</h3>
<p>Pingdi Spring Correspondence: The situation in Suidong is becoming increasingly tense. Pingdi Spring is the center of Suidong and is currently a military stronghold. Since Zhao Chengshou from Datong and Fu Zuoyi from Suiyuan met in Pingdi Spring, the bandit troops of Wang Daoyi, who invaded Suidong, have suffered a disastrous defeat. Afterwards, Fu Zuoyi and Zhao Chengshou returned to their original defenses. Currently, the old man sitting in Pingdi Spring is Zeng Yanyi, the brigade commander of Fu's troops and the commander of the Suidong Security Forces. Peng Yufu, the cavalry brigade commander of Zhao's troops, also returned to Pingdi Spring from the front after leading his troops to suppress the bandits. They were warmly welcomed and comforted by the people of Pingdi Spring. Damilingsulong, the general manager of the Zheng Huang Banner, volunteered to lead the way in this bandit suppression. He has now also returned to Pingdi Spring. The reporter went to Pingdi Spring from Sui on the tenth to inspect and recorded the impressions as follows:</p>
<p>Pingdi Spring is Jining County. Recently, the Pingsui Railway also changed the Pingdi Spring Station to Jining County. Jining County has not been established for long. The place is quite high, so the climate is very cool. Suiyuan has had a good harvest this year. From Sui to Ji, one suddenly feels cool, as if it is already late autumn. Pingdi Spring is now extremely stable, enough to break many fantasies and speculations. The people's hearts are extremely stable. There are a considerable number of garrison infantry, cavalry, and artillery, which is slightly more than usual, but the troops' movements are all at night, so the people do not feel nervous at all. This place is divided into two areas, east and west of the bridge. The railway runs horizontally in the middle. The residents west of the bridge are all natives, and the shops are all run by "locals." East of the bridge, there are many people from Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and other places. The locals generally call them "East Road people." East Road business is also all east of the bridge. The boundary between east and west of the bridge is clear and distinct. There is an invisible confrontation between merchants and civilians. In the entire Suiyuan Province, the cities with the prototype of a city and relatively prosperous are Guihua and Baotou, in addition to Pingdi Spring. Jining and Baotou, in Suidong and Suixi, can echo each other remotely.</p>
<p>There is one theater each east and west of the bridge. The theater east of the bridge is a new building. Its grandeur is second to none in Suiyuan. The audience in the theater at night is extremely crowded. A peaceful atmosphere can be seen in general. The families of the local garrison troops are strictly prohibited from moving by Fu Zuoyi, and all officers are also very optimistic. No one thinks about moving their families. The stability of the people's hearts is also one reason. Jining's grain merchants are the most developed. There are currently 40 grain stores. The smallest scale also has a capital of 5,000 yuan. After deducting all expenses throughout the year, a net profit of 12,000 yuan can still be obtained. The profits of larger scales can be seen in general. Because grain is exported in large quantities in this area, the market is extremely prosperous. In terms of tax revenue in the entire Suiyuan Province, this place is also an important area.</p>
<p>Currently, Pingdi Spring is the military center of Suidong. Those who have operated this place in the past cannot help but think of Feng Yuxiang. Tiger Mountain shields Jining County. Although the mountain is small, it is extremely dangerous. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, Feng Yuxiang began to operate it. Extremely large barracks were built at that time, which could station more than ten divisions of troops. Feng intended to surround Tiger Mountain within the county seat, so the Jining County building was quite large when it was first built. Later, the barracks were gradually destroyed. Until today, the construction of this largest barracks has collapsed and there are no traces left. The building surrounding Tiger Mountain on that day has also gradually collapsed. Therefore, the county seat has been reduced. Now, Tiger Mountain has been划出城外, and the garrison troops have built bunkers on the top of the mountain and pitched tents. This time, the bandit troops of Wang Daoyi disturbed Suidong. It was rumored that they were fighting with the garrison troops on Tiger Mountain, but in fact, it was still far from Tiger Mountain. Jining has been prepared for military affairs under the management of the Suiyuan authorities in recent years. The local garrison troops are extremely calm. This kind of spirit and psychology has a great effect. The current military leaders in Jining are Zeng Yanyi, the infantry brigade commander, Peng Yufu, the cavalry brigade commander, and Damilingsulong, the general manager of the Zheng Huang Banner on the Mongolian side. Zeng Yanyi has been stationed in Suidong for many years, and his achievements in suppressing bandits are very good. He is extremely admired by the people of Suidong. Zeng in Suidong is just like Wang Jingguo in Suixi, no less than Fu Zuoyi's right and left arms. Before the bandit troops of Wang Daoyi set out, more than 30 bandits were wandering in the territory of Xinghe. Zeng's troops encircled and suppressed them, and they were wiped out in one fell swoop. The bandit leader Yu escaped with his life. All of these more than 30 bandits were executed, and the people of Suidong were very happy.</p>
<p>Peng Yufu has the best academic qualifications and has the demeanor of a Confucian scholar. Yan Xishan values him quite highly. This year, he was training officers in the Bing Training Institute, and he ordered Peng to serve as an instructor. Recently, Suidong was in a tight situation, and Peng began to return to the defense. This time, Peng led his troops to attack the bandits in the middle of the night, reaching the pseudo-headquarters of Wang Daoyi's bandits. He fought with fewer troops than the enemy, and responded calmly. Yan, Chuan, and Zhao were extremely gratified, and many local people in Sui also comforted him. Although Damilingsulong is one of the four banner managers of Suidong, he is actually the leader in an invisible way. He usually does his best to suppress the bandits, and the bandits are very afraid of him. Da is about fifty years old this year, with a long beard under his chin, about two feet long. He usually ties it into a braid and takes great care of it. The bandits call Da "Long Beard." Da is most familiar with the geography of Suidong. This time, Wang Daoyi's bandit pseudo-headquarters was set up in Tuchengzi. Peng's brigade attacked, and Da led the way, crossing the bandit sentry at night and entering through a secret passage, causing the bandits to be caught off guard and suffer the greatest loss. Da's contribution to this battle is very significant. The rumor that Da was captured is absolutely untrue. This long-bearded Mongolian hero is still alive and well, and it can be seen that he will still be a strong enemy of the bandits in the future.</p>
<p>This time, the bandits attacked Honggenertu twice, but both failed. The number of local garrison troops and militias was not large, but because the terrain of Honggenertu is dangerous, the military and civilians are united, so they can win more with less. The mentality of the local people is also worthy of attention. Everyone believes that Honggenertu is as solid as gold, and there will never be any worries, which is the same as the mentality of the military and civilians in Jining who believe that Suidong will never be lost.</p>
<p>Peng's brigade obtained various documents in this suppression of Wang Daoyi's bandit headquarters, including Wang's letter to a certain adviser and his inauguration announcement. The wording is extremely bizarre, making people laugh and cry when reading it. Wang called the so-called senior adviser Master, and called himself a student. The bandit army called itself the Northwest Anti-Communist Autonomous Army.</p>
<h3>Shandong Province Long-Distance Telephone Communications with Hebei, Jiangsu, and Henan Lines – Weihai Telephone Will Also Be Installed and Connected –</h3>
<p>Jinan communication, Shandong Province's long-distance telephone business has been actively developing in recent years. All 108 counties in the province have been connected to telephone calls. Now, new-style telephones and copper coins have been replaced to strive for clear voices. The transmission of government orders has been fast and convenient, and it is also convenient for the public to exchange messages. Currently, plans are being actively made to open up Shandong-Hebei, Shandong-Jiangsu, Shandong-Henan, and Weihai lines, which are expected to be realized soon. The progress of each money is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Shandong-Hebei</p>
<p>The electric wire between Hebei and Shandong has already been erected. Later, in order to make the sound between Jinan and Baoding clear, another money was erected in the Baoding line, which will be erected to Linqing to connect the money. The office is located in Sanjiantang, Leling County. Currently, the Construction Department of the two provinces is discussing the business regulations. Soon, the two money will be connected, and the regulations will be drafted, and business can be started. The general method is that each call between Hebei and Shandong costs one yuan, each call from Hebei to Sanjiantang costs six corners, and each call from Sanjiantang to Jinan costs four corners.</p>
<p>Shandong-Jiangsu</p>
<p>The connection of the Jiangsu-Shandong joint line has been discussed many times. The Jiangsu Province line has been erected from Xuzhou to Taierzhuang and has been connected to telephone calls. The office is located in Taierzhuang and is also preparing to start business. The regulations are being drafted and will be drafted soon. After this line is in business, it can pass through Xuzhou to Nanjing and Zhenjiang from Jinan, which is much more convenient than telegram.</p>
<p>Shandong-Henan</p>
<p>The Shandong-Henan joint line was planned by the two provinces last year. Later, the electric poles were washed away due to the flood in western Shandong, and the project was suspended in the middle. It is now being discussed again. It is reported that the location of the money connection between the two provinces is between Cao County and Lanfeng. The line that should be erected in Shandong has already been erected. Henan is still under construction and has not yet been connected. After the line is connected, business regulations will be discussed.</p>
<p>Weihai</p>
<p>Qingdao and Weihai are both part of this province. Qingdao was civilized earlier, and all communication agencies were completed earlier. Weihai originally belonged to Wendeng County in this province. Due to the lack of unity of administrative power, Weihai has not been contacted after the calls in various counties in this province. Sun Xifeng, the commissioner of the area, is currently discussing telephone calls with the Construction Department. A line will be divided from Muping County to Weihai. The journey is relatively short, about 70 to 80 miles. The two sides will share the cost of pole line materials and other items and are preparing for it. It can be realized soon.</p>
<h3>Qingdao National Election Supervisor Shen Honglie Holds Oath; Fellow Compatriots from Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe in Qingdao Also Participate in the Election in Qingdao</h3>
<p>Qingdao Communication: Since its establishment, the Qingdao Municipal Representative Election Office of the National Assembly has completed the matters related to the citizenship oath and registration in order. At 10:00 a.m. on the 14th of this month, the second office meeting was held to discuss the implementation plan, and to notify the residents of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, and other provinces who live in this city and have citizenship qualifications that those who have not participated in the citizenship oath registration may go to the construction office under their jurisdiction before the 15th of this month to take the oath. The election supervisor, Shen Honglie, is now approaching the election period, and specially held an inauguration election supervisor oath at 1:30 p.m. on the 14th at the City Government Auditorium. Jiang Bocheng, the Central Committee member who was specially sent to Qingdao for summer vacation, represented the supervisor nearby. Leaders of various agencies and organizations in this city, representatives of various guilds, and officials above the director of the City Government participated in the ceremony. After the ceremony, the oath taker first raised his right hand to read the oath, followed by the supervisor Jiang Bocheng to deliver a training speech, and finally the oath taker Shen Honglie to deliver a speech, saying: "Today, I am holding the Qingdao Municipal Representative Election Supervisor Oath Ceremony of the National Assembly. I am grateful to the Central Committee for sending Commissioner Jiang to supervise the oath and give detailed instructions, and I am grateful to the leaders and gentry of all circles in this city for their participation in guidance. The responsibility of the election supervisor is very important. I should be sincere and sincere, abide by the oath, and the central representative's instructions, supervise the personnel of the entire generation office to abide by laws and regulations, and be fair in order to elect representatives who are virtuous, enthusiastic about public welfare, and truly represent public opinion, and truly represent the people's will, so as not to live up to the great intentions entrusted by the central government. Since the 16th year of the Republic of China, the central government has been engaged in political training in order to gradually realize constitutional government. Now the draft constitution has been formulated and promulgated, and preparations are being made to convene the National Assembly. Therefore, there is this election of citizen representatives, so that the people of the Republic of China can obtain citizenship qualifications to exercise the four political powers of election, initiative, referendum, and recall, and create a new era of the Republic of China. This city stipulates that there are five representatives in total, two of whom are elected by the citizens of the city, one of whom is elected by the Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations, one of whom is elected by various labor unions, and one of whom is elected by the Farmers' Association and Fishermen's Association. However, the Farmers' Association and Fishermen's Association in this city have not been formally established. All of the one representative who should be sent has been telegraphed to the general office to allow an additional representative to be added to other professional groups or regional representatives, but there has been no reply. In addition, the free professional groups and special elections of the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe residing in this city are also commissioned by the election offices to be handled by this city, and the ballots are sent to the central government for counting. The election schedule is that the citizenship oath registration will be completed before August 15. This city has been completed on schedule. Before the 31st of this month, ten times the candidates for regional representatives and three times the candidates for professional national body representatives should be introduced and sent to the general office for approval. Before October 10, the election should be completed immediately. Before November 5, the elected representatives should gather in the capital. On November 10, the National Assembly will be held. The citizens of this city have always abided by the law. They have a deep understanding of the National Representative Election Conference, which is open to both men and women, rich and poor. It is hoped that leaders from all walks of life will widely educate them at any time and anywhere, so that they can actively participate, and I beg the Central Committee Representative Jiang and all the guests to continue to guide them in the future, so that the election can be completed smoothly and the foundation of the country can be consolidated from now on. That is what is expected.” (August 14)</p>
<h3>Suzhou Manufactures New-Style Carriages</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Highway Administration believes that with the recent development of highways and convenient transportation, but the price of gasoline is expensive, it would be more economical if animal power could be used instead and carriages could be driven. Therefore, it specially entrusted the Provincial Agricultural Tool Manufacturing Plant outside the Xumen here to design and build new-style carriages. The plant is now trial-manufacturing. It is estimated that people will be transported on three sides of the carriage. Each carriage can seat eleven people, including the coachman. At the same time, bullets are added to the wheel axle, and special ivory tires are used, and various mechanisms are improved. Therefore, although this new-style carriage carries a weight of more than a thousand pounds, its thrust is quite light and fast. If the results are excellent in the future, they will be driven on a large scale on various highways.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Approvals: Continued Negotiations on Factory Inspections; Notification to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions</h3>
<p>Following the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' objections to the consular body's agreement on factory inspections, that work has been effectively stalled. To uphold sovereignty, a special request was submitted to the Ministry of Industry to vigorously negotiate for a satisfactory resolution. The Federation received a document approved by the Ministry of Industry, Labor Department, No. 5035: "Petition for Continued Vigorous Efforts to Implement the Shanghai Special District Factory Inspection Agreement Draft." The Ministry acknowledges receipt of the petition and states that as this case concerns national sovereignty, it is imperative to negotiate vigorously and reasonably until a satisfactory resolution is reached. You are hereby notified.</p>
<h3>Local News</h3>
<p>New Rice Arrives in Shanghai; Rice Reserves Increase by Over a Million Piculs</p>
<p>According to the Da Gong News Agency, since early rice harvests in various regions were plentiful this year, rice has been continuously shipped to Shanghai for sale. As a result, the city's warehouses now hold over a million piculs of both new and old rice. With the weather gradually turning cooler and merchants' sales becoming more active, market prices have risen slightly. Japanese Mitsui &amp; Co. and others are also steadily stockpiling new rice. Details are reported as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Rice Supply Soars</p>
<p>In early last month, during the lean season, Shanghai's rice reserves were only about 200,000 piculs, barely enough to feed the city for a month. Subsequently, new japonica rice from Pudong entered the market, followed by abundant early rice from Wenzhou and Taizhou. The first crops of early rice from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, including Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui, were harvested and shipped to Shanghai in large quantities, reaching 70,000 to 80,000 bags daily. According to statistics from rice trade associations, the total rice reserves in the city's warehouses, including the previous stock, have reached over one million piculs, enough to feed Shanghai for four months.</p>
<p>Exports Active</p>
<p>Export merchants from Yantai, Tianjin, Weihaiwei, Singapore, and other places, who are stationed in Shanghai for transshipment, had previously reported reduced orders due to the hot summer weather, as the long transportation distances increased the risk of spoilage from red rot and insect infestation. This had led to sluggish sales and falling prices in the rice market. Now that autumn has arrived, these merchants are purchasing new japonica and indica rice in large quantities, making exports active again. Consequently, market prices have slightly increased. However, compared to the period around the Dragon Boat Festival in May, prices are still two to three yuan lower. Market observers note that this year's early rice harvest was plentiful, and if there are no autumn disasters to damage the late rice crop, the overall harvest will be good.</p>
<p>Transportation Adjustments</p>
<p>China is known as an agricultural nation, and the total rice production is sufficient to feed the entire population with surplus. However, due to transportation difficulties, surplus rice in one region, beyond what is needed for the local population, accumulates, causing prices to plummet, hurting farmers' livelihoods and leaving produce to rot. Conversely, in another region with limited production, or affected by natural disasters or human-made calamities, there is a shortage of food, leading to widespread starvation. The disparity between these two situations is vast. To facilitate the smooth flow of goods and make the best use of resources, Shanghai's rice trade associations have suggested that the government urgently address transportation adjustments and reduce freight rates to allow for the balanced distribution and sale of rice across the country, thereby stabilizing market prices.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Buying Rice</p>
<p>Japanese Mitsui &amp; Co. and others began purchasing new wheat crops in various regions this year, in large quantities. Now that new early rice is available, Japanese merchants are again buying in the interior, though in smaller amounts. This is because China's early rice this year has firm grains and low moisture content, so long-term storage should not pose a problem.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Remittances Surge; Over 200 Million Yuan Since August; Remittances from Britain, America, and Southeast Asia</p>
<p>According to the Hua Dong News Agency, domestic political and economic conditions have shown significant progress this year compared to previous years. Consequently, the overseas Chinese community's perception of their homeland is no longer as guarded as it was in recent years. Since this spring, overseas Chinese from various regions have formed inspection teams to visit and assess the country, expressing satisfaction with various development projects. As a result, overseas Chinese residing in Britain, the United States, the Southeast Asian archipelago, the Philippines, and other places are now remitting their commercial surplus earnings for deposit. In the past two months, with the stability of exchange rates between Britain and the United States, overseas Chinese remittances have exceeded 200 million yuan, according to inquiries made by reporters this morning at foreign exchange banks. This provides significant assistance to the government's international payments.</p>
<p>Ambassadors Wang and Jin to Depart on the Same Ship; Setting Sail on a German Vessel on the 19th</p>
<p>Wang Jingqi, the newly appointed ambassador to Sweden and Norway, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing and is scheduled to depart on the German liner "Niasna" on the 19th to take up his new post. During his previous tenure as ambassador to Belgium, Wang made significant efforts to promote Sino-Belgian relations and contributed to cultural exchange. The Sino-Belgian Friendship Association will host a farewell banquet for Wang at the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road at 7 p.m. today, with prominent figures from both countries invited to attend. The event is expected to be a grand affair. It is reported that Wang has three daughters, all of whom graduated from universities in Belgium with doctoral degrees. Only the eldest daughter, Chang Cong, will accompany him on this trip to study Nordic women's lives and serve as the director of the Paris Women's Weekly.</p>
<p>Jin Wensi, according to the Xin Sheng News Agency, Jin Wensi, the ambassador to the Netherlands, recently passed through Shanghai from Beijing, returning to his ancestral home in Pinghu to visit relatives. He has now returned to Shanghai and is scheduled to depart on the German liner "Niasna" with his family on the morning of the 19th to return to his post. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Jin at his residence yesterday. Jin stated that he had been abroad for many years and was not fully aware of the situation in China. Therefore, he made a special trip back to the country. He stayed for four months and bid farewell to Foreign Minister Zhang and other officials in Beijing. He stated there was no need to go to Beijing again before departure. After leaving on the 19th, he expects to arrive in Rotterdam in a month, then transfer to The Hague. Relations between China and the Netherlands are currently very amicable, with no outstanding issues. Jin added in response to a reporter's question that China's foreign policy had been explained in detail by President Jiang and Foreign Minister Zhang in their speeches. As an ambassador, he would follow the government's instructions and provide explanations to the government of the host country if they had any questions. Jin also said that he was gratified to see that China had moved towards true unification and that the recent disturbances in Guangdong and Guangxi had been resolved quickly, showing progress in national affairs. He said he was honored to be able to share this news with people in the host country. Jin also mentioned that the proposal to amend the League of Nations Covenant had come from the League itself, and China, as a member state, would submit its opinions, but he was not yet aware of the details.</p>

He was originally scheduled to fly to Shanghai yesterday, but due to unforeseen circumstances, the flight was postponed until today, when he will fly to Shanghai on a China National Aviation Corporation southbound flight.</p>
<p>Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to Inspect Imported Cotton Seeds Starting Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry will begin inspecting imported cotton seeds today. A public notice states that, in accordance with the Ministry of Industry's instructions, imported cotton seeds can only be imported through Shanghai, allowing for inspection and disinfection before the comprehensive implementation of plant pest inspection by various inspection bureaus. Preparations have been made, and the date of implementation has been set. Therefore, starting from August 16th, imported cotton seeds will not be allowed to be declared for import without a certificate of qualification issued by the Bureau. The inspection fees will be in accordance with Item 5 of Section D of the Ministry's Table of Plant Pest Inspection Fees, which charges one fen of national currency per picul (market system). This notice is hereby issued for general information. Director: Cai Wuji.</p>
<p>Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Industries to Comply: Registering Artificial Silk; Member Merchants to Obtain Certification for Shipping Native Goods</p>
<p>The Shanghai Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Industry Association states that it has received an order from the Ministry of Finance to issue inspection and clearance methods for factories using artificial silk or incorporating artificial silk into native cloth. The Jianghai Customs has also published a notice stipulating a 14-day deadline for clearing existing inventory from the date of the notice. The Association, noting the short deadline and the complexity of the inspection and clearance registration procedures, fears that it will be difficult to complete the work on time. Therefore, it sent a letter to the Customs yesterday requesting an extension, at least until the end of the month, to allow for adequate progress in clearing inventory. In the interim, if members need to ship products to the interior, the Association will facilitate the necessary certification procedures to obtain shipping permits for native goods. The process involves members completing an application form, which will be reviewed by the Association. Upon approval, a certificate will be issued, which can then be used to obtain a shipping permit from the Customs. The Association has already printed the necessary certification forms and registration books and will notify members to collect them immediately. The original notice is copied below:</p>
<p>Inventory Clearance and Registration</p>
<p>Case received from the Jianghai Customs No. 2604 stating that inspection and clearance methods for factories using artificial silk or incorporating artificial silk into native cloth have been stipulated. A 14-day deadline is set for clearing existing inventory from the date of the notice. Please inform members accordingly. Members should inspect their inventory. The procedure is complicated, especially as evidence of artificial silk raw materials must be submitted. Efforts should be made to obtain supplementary evidence from the artificial silk dealers from whom the materials were purchased. Due to the short deadline, it is imperative to work day and night to complete the process. The Association has prepared registration forms and books, based on the Customs' forms, to standardize the process. These books have already been printed and are available in two types: (Type A is for registering raw materials, Type B is for registering existing inventory. Each book contains 50 pages and costs one yuan in national currency. Loose registration forms are available for 40 cents each.) Members are requested to prepare funds and collect these items from the Association immediately for compliance. This matter is important, so please do not delay. This notice is hereby issued.</p>
<p>Shipping Permits</p>
<p>Case received from the Jianghai Customs No. 1533 stating that native goods similar to foreign goods requiring shipping permits, when shipped to various locations within the country, must obtain a shipping permit for native goods before shipment. The Association immediately dispatched personnel to negotiate with the Customs on multiple occasions and obtained Customs' agreement that during the inspection period for artificial silk woven into native cloth and the clearance of existing inventory, members who need to ship self-manufactured textiles to various locations within the country can first apply to the Association for a certificate, which can then be used to obtain a shipping permit from the Customs to accompany the goods. When applying to the Association for certification, members must prepare the necessary documents and find two reputable guarantors to provide a guarantee. After the guarantee form is reviewed and approved by the Association, a certificate will be issued. The relevant guarantee forms and application forms have been printed and are ready for members to collect for shipping purposes. This notice is hereby issued. Shanghai Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Industry Association.</p>

<p>Collection of Eulogies</p>
<p>(1) Eulogy from the Municipal Party Headquarters: On this, the fifteenth day of August, in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, the executive and supervisory committee members and all staff of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters solemnly offer clear wine and delicate flowers in memory of Mr. Wu Xingya, member of the Central Executive Committee and standing committee member of the Municipal Party Headquarters. Alas, sir, a hero of the party and the nation, you harbored great ambitions from a young age and joined the Tongmenghui in your prime. During the Xinhai Revolution, you participated in military affairs and promoted revolution. Your writings were timely and detailed, your verbal and written condemnations resonated throughout the country. When the Premier met with disaster, you followed his entourage, enduring many frightening nights. You remained composed, never altering your demeanor, which the Premier found remarkable. He took you along on expeditions, where you repeatedly achieved extraordinary merits, earning fame far and wide. You accompanied the Premier north, serving him with utmost sincerity. When the Premier passed away, you held him up with your hands, your heart breaking and tears flowing. During the Chairman's Northern Expedition, you served with the army, enduring hardship in Anhui and Hubei. You served as chairman of a generation, as heads of two civil affairs departments, leaving behind a reputation of kindness and virtue. People sang your praises. Upon your arrival in Shanghai, you especially resonated with the public sentiment. As Director of Social Affairs, you were honest and impartial in your duties, leading popular movements and mediating disputes. You were fair and just, your judgment clear. People at home and abroad praised your governance. Alas, you overworked yourself, and sickness befell you. You sought healing in another place, hoping it would lighten your burden. The disease did not abate, and you dreamt of death. You followed the Premier on a journey to the heavens. As you passed away, you left behind the words, "The revolution is not yet complete. My ambitions have not been realized. My eyes will not close." Alas, like a collapsing house, a great man has fallen. The beams have broken, the trees have decayed, the mountains have crumbled. The party has lost a guide, the nation has lost a hero. We return your remains, wiping away tears of sorrow. We offer a piece of incense, in memory of your noble spirit. Alas, may you rest in peace. (2) Eulogy from the Funeral Committee: On this, the fifteenth day of August, in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, the members of the Funeral Committee solemnly offer clear wine and simple fare to the spirit of Comrade Wu Xingya. Alas, Director Wu, a revolutionary pioneer, born in Hubei, with lofty ambitions. In a time of chaos, the proper order was lost. You held anxieties in your heart and embarked on a long journey. You went south to Guangdong, embraced the Three Principles of the People, and vowed to stop the imperial ambitions and eliminate chaos. You fought against adversity and wiped away tears, working tirelessly day and night. You completed great achievements. As the Northern Expedition began, you amplified your ambition, wielding your shield and drafting documents. You were appointed to important positions, and you planned meticulously. Your achievements were clear for all to see. You were then appointed to Shanghai, where you inspired the people and spread your influence like a spring breeze. Diligent in your service to the country, you were honest and unwavering. Your comrades admired you, and the citizens praised you. How could we have known that illness would strike you down. You sought healing in the mountains, but to no avail. We lost a mentor, and Heaven is unforgiving. Alas, when the news arrived, the beams collapsed, and the house fell. The people of Shanghai mourned. From north to south, the country was shocked. You were cherished by the party and the nation, how could you have left so soon? You loved the community, how could you have forgotten? With sorrow and grief, all of us comrades are filled with lament. Alas, your life was a heroic one for our party. Your sincerity and dedication were unmatched. Now that you are gone, your name will endure forever. Though adorned with decorations, you are still alive. We summon your soul. May you rest in peace. Alas, may you look down upon us and accept our offerings. (3) Eulogy from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions: On this, the fifteenth day of August, in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, the entire executive and supervisory committee of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, leading all the workers of the city, solemnly offer incense, flowers, and seasonal food in memory of Director Wu Xingya. Alas, Director Wu, a pioneer of the nation, a revolutionary from youth, with a spirit that soared through the heavens. You promoted the party's principles and awakened the masses. You assisted the Premier with loyalty and devotion. During the Northern Expedition, the whole country followed. You experienced danger and hardship, and ultimately achieved success. In recognition of your achievements, you were promoted to high office. You presided over Anhui and Hubei, and the shade of your influence was pervasive. You were transferred to Shanghai, where you were admired and respected. You guided the youth and benefited the laborers. We had hoped that you would achieve even greater accomplishments, but unexpectedly, illness caused you to fall from Lushan. Alas, Director Wu, you came south on a voyage, riding the waves. Now you have returned to the void. Who will resolve the national crisis? Who will save the workers from poverty? Thinking of the present, how can we not feel sorrow? We offer these tears as a testament to our sincere grief. Alas, may you rest in peace. (4) Eulogy from Wu Kaixian, Member of the Central Committee: On this, the fifteenth day of August, in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, Wu Kaixian respectfully offers clear wine and simple fare to the spirit of my deceased friend, Comrade Wu Xingya. Alas, Director Wu, a hero of our party, you vowed to revolution and abandoned your pen for the army. When the Premier met with disaster, you followed him from Guangdong, facing arrows and stones with courage and loyalty. You sacrificed yourself for the party and the nation, achieving great accomplishments. All of us comrades admired and respected you. In recent years, you were appointed to Shanghai, leading the people with fairness and integrity. I was fortunate to hear your voice and bask in your influence. I regretted not meeting you sooner and held you close to my heart. We shared hardship together, and you personally took charge. You directed with certainty, and I followed your lead. We followed each other for five years, blending like water and milk. We shared both joy and sorrow. You were a scholar, gentle and refined. You should have lived a long life, serving as a pillar of the party. But Heaven was unkind, and you took away my esteemed colleague. The beams collapsed, and the house fell, the wind and rain obscuring our vision. I remember you leaving for Jiangxi, with heavy hearts. You spoke of national affairs, your heart filled with concern. How could you have let go and ended your life? The party and the nation have suffered a loss that cannot be replaced. Weeping at your coffin, my sorrow is endless. May your soul be aware, and may you look down upon my sincerity. Alas, may you rest in peace. (5) Eulogy from the Municipal Public Security Bureau: On this, the fifteenth day of August, in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, Cai Jinjun, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, leading all staff, respectfully offers flowers and wine to the spirit of Director Wu Xingya. The majestic Mount Huo and Han River are extraordinary. From there, you were born. In your early years, you were a revolutionary, assisting the military. You followed the Premier, unwavering through hardship. After the completion of the Northern Expedition, you were entrusted with important responsibilities. The hundred industries of Shanghai depended on your coordination. Quiet and distant, you placed the people's concerns above all else. Your achievements will endure. May you rest in peace. There were also eulogies from the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Bureau of Education, the Chinese Cultural Construction Association and its branches in various provinces and cities, 72 cultural organizations, the Shanghai Citizen Training Office, the Shanghai Youth Comrades, the Shanghai Youth Society, Chih Tze University, Minli Girls' Middle School, and Binhai Middle School, but they cannot all be recorded here.</p>
<p>Former Huadong Fishing Boat Sinks off Pudong; Discussions Underway for Salvage</p>
<p>The "Huadong No. 1," a small motorized fishing boat belonging to the Shanghai Huadong Fishing Company, was returning to Shanghai for routine annual maintenance, as the fishing season had ended. While docking at the Gongmao Shipyard in Bailianjing, Pudong yesterday, it is believed that the tide caused the boat to run aground first. Then, the hull tilted, and despite the urgent efforts of the boatmen and shipyard workers, the boat capsized in front of the Gongmao dock. The boatmen were all able to leave the boat, and no accidents occurred. After the boat sank, the Huadong Fishing Company sent personnel to Pudong to survey the scene with technicians from the Gongmao Shipyard. Huadong Company is also negotiating with the shipyard, requesting them to take responsibility for the salvage operation. It is reported that the salvage is extremely difficult at the location where the boat sank, and the shipyard believes that it will involve a complicated procedure.</p>
<p>China Textile Mill Association Issues Report on National Textile Mill Status</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the China Textile Mill Association recently compiled a "List of Chinese Textile Mills" and issued a report on the status of textile mills nationwide. There are a total of 143 textile mills, including Chinese, British, and Japanese-owned mills. Chinese-owned: 95; British-owned: 4; Japanese-owned: 44, same as last year. "Total spindles: 5,022,397, an increase of 83,556 over last year. Chinese-owned: 2,850,745, an increase of 43,354 over last year. Japanese-owned: 1,944,504, a decrease of 2,028 over last year. British-owned: 227,148, an increase of 42,240 over last year. "Total thread spindles: 504,450, an increase of 61,593 over last year. Chinese-owned: 157,734, an increase of 13,689 over last year. British-owned: 6,360, an increase of 3,640 over last year. Japanese-owned: 340,356, an increase of 44,264 over last year. "Looms": A total of 52,009 looms, of which 24,861 were Chinese-owned, an increase of 2,294 over last year; 4,012 were British-owned, an increase of 1,130 over last year; and 23,127 were Japanese-owned, an increase of 1,521 over last year. In terms of spindles, Japanese-owned mills have actually decreased. In the Shanghai area, Japanese-owned mills have significantly reduced spindles, with a net decrease of 10,584, while spindles have increased in other locations. This trend is also seen in Chinese-owned mills. Chinese-owned mills in Shanghai have also reduced spindles by 7,786, while spindles have increased in other locations. This indicates a new trend of China's textile industry moving inland. The above data reflects the situation in the spring. Recently, after Japanese-owned mills acquired three Chinese-owned mills in North China, the number of spindles in Chinese-owned mills will decrease significantly, while the number in Japanese-owned mills will increase significantly. Total workers: 207,899, a decrease of 15,837 over last year. Chinese-owned mills: 129,126, a decrease of 13,928. British-owned mills: 10,000, a decrease of 3,000. Japanese-owned mills: 68,683, an increase of 1,091. The trend of decreasing workers in textile mills is becoming more pronounced. Compared to four years ago, the number has decreased by 50,000. The decrease is entirely in Chinese-owned mills. Compared to five years ago, the number of workers in Chinese-owned mills has decreased by over 53,000. This is because the efficiency of Chinese-owned mills has improved in recent years, leading to a reduction in the number of workers required. Secondly, the number of mills that have suspended or reduced operations has increased. In the past year, textile mills nationwide produced 2,025,489 large bales of yarn, compared to 2,288,357 last year, a decrease of 262,868 bales. Chinese-owned mills produced 1,437,692 bales, a decrease of 158,223 bales. British-owned mills produced 41,000 bales, a decrease of 34,000 bales. Japanese-owned mills produced 546,797 bales, a decrease of 70,646 bales. Fabric production totaled 1,035,575,000 square yards, an increase of 36,252,000 square yards over last year. Chinese-owned mills produced 358,714,000 square yards, a decrease of 11,902,000 square yards. British-owned mills produced 43,000,000 square yards, a decrease of 24,000,000 square yards. Japanese-owned mills produced 633,861,000 square yards, an increase of 72,155,000 square yards. Both yarn and fabric production decreased in Chinese and British-owned mills due to reduced operations. While yarn production decreased in Japanese-owned mills, fabric production increased significantly due to an increase in weaving operations. Therefore, while the number of spindles in Chinese-owned mills appears better than Japanese-owned mills, the actual production tells a different story.</p>
<p>Newly Appointed Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Kawasoe, Arrived Yesterday Afternoon; Returning Home on the Same Ship This Morning Before Returning to Shanghai to Take Up His Post</p>
<p>Kawasoe Tatsuo, the former Japanese Consul-General in Guangdong, was appointed as the Consul-General in Shanghai. Due to illness, he delayed his arrival. The duties were temporarily assumed by Minister Counsellor Waksugi Kaname from the Embassy. Kawasoe's illness has gradually improved, and he is returning to Japan for recuperation. He passed through Shanghai yesterday, arriving at 11:30 a.m. on the Japanese ship "Tatsuta Maru". Waksugi, Naval Attaché Sato, Commercial Attaché Iwai, Chief of the Information Department Yoshioka, Consul Terasaki, Secretary Takahashi, Secretary Izumikawa, Secretary Nakata, and Japanese community leaders Kanoh, Yoshida, and others went to the ship to welcome him. Kawasoe did not disembark and returned to Japan on the same ship this morning at 7:30 a.m. He is expected to return to Shanghai to take up his post in about a month.</p>
<p>Six Companies Reach Agreement on Limiting Piece Goods Shipments; Each Ship Limited to 200 Pieces per Voyage</p>
<p>Since the Yangtze River Six Companies agreed on relaxed piece goods measurement standards and approved standard freight rates, they have been implemented for many days. However, it was recently discovered that a major company was shipping containers exceeding 25 feet without adhering to the agreed-upon rates (a 25-foot container costs 5.75 yuan in transportation fees, while a 26-foot container, calculated based on 40 feet at 13.60 yuan, should cost 8.84 yuan, with an extra foot costing 3.09 yuan). It was privately relaxing measurement and freight rate standards. This resulted in all piece goods shipments being booked with that one company's ships, leading to opposition from the other five companies, who believed this constituted a breach of the revenue sharing agreement and a violation of the approved plan. Therefore, the five companies convened a full meeting of all six companies to discuss preventing irregular competition and emphasizing the importance of adhering to the agreement for the collective benefit of the six companies. It was agreed on the spot that, effective immediately, any ship belonging to a company within the revenue sharing alliance, regardless of the company, would only be permitted to load 200 pieces of piece goods per voyage for shipments from Shanghai to the Yangtze River. Any excess would be rejected by Customs and rerouted to other ships (within the six companies). Even if all six companies filled their quotas, they would only be allowed to ship on the following day to avoid any disputes. This new agreement has been implemented since yesterday.</p>
<p>Soviet Consul-General Spirvanig Takes Leave of Absence</p>
<p>According to information from the Public Works Department, Spirvanig, Counsellor of the Soviet Embassy and Consul-General in Shanghai, is currently on leave. His duties as Consul-General have been temporarily assumed by Deputy Consul Milikovsky.</p>

<p>Xue Jiasheng Freed After Kidnapping; Four Kidnappers Confess the Truth; Rented Youning Car and Changed License Plate; Box Cannon Discovered in Hideout</p>
<p>Xue Jiasheng, the third son of the late Jiangyin dye merchant Xue Baorun, who resided at No. 5, Lane 1412, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, was kidnapped by armed men while resting at home at 5:30 p.m. on the 1st of this month. Two weeks passed, and the family received letters from the kidnappers urging them to arrange a ransom, but without result. Finally, on the afternoon of the 14th, the French police received a tip about the kidnappers' location. Dozens of Chinese and foreign detectives armed themselves and rushed to No. 222, Rue Paul Beau. They apprehended six accomplices, and Xue Jiasheng was rescued unharmed. These details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that among the six suspects apprehended by the French police, four have been positively identified as kidnappers: (1) Bu Mingqing, 42, from Xuzhou, sentenced to five years imprisonment by the former French Court in 1929 for kidnapping. After serving his term, he was turned over to the domestic authorities. After his sentence was re-examined and approved by the Special Court No. 2, he was released. (2) Chen Jintang, 40, from Anhui. (3) Sun Zhengnan, 26, from Jiangbei. (4) Pu Yaozhang, 55, from Yangzhou. According to Bu's confession, he and his accomplices used box cannons to enter Xue's residence and kidnap him. The car they used</p>

<p>A Major Shift in the Psychology of the National Art Community</p>
<p>The era of the art world purchasing imported oil paints, watercolors, or other painting supplies is now a thing of the past. They are all being replaced by the Eagle brand products of the Jincheng Craft Cooperative. According to experts, this phenomenon is noteworthy for several reasons: (1) Most imported products on the market are incomplete and in short supply, and their disappearance is imminent, which can reduce some losses. (2) Chinese people are also capable of manufacturing 100% standard domestic products to fully replace foreign goods, demonstrating that China is not completely devoid of diligent individuals and proving that the intelligence of Chinese people is not inferior to that of foreigners. (3) People in the art world possess keen vision and accurate discernment, enabling them to eliminate the inferior and select the superior without error.</p>
<p>From this, it is evident that domestic producers must first create perfect products to gain the automatic trust of consumers and then change their usual psychology of worshiping foreign goods. This is an immutable principle.</p>
<p>Recently, various primary and secondary schools have learned that many experts and teachers are praising the products of the Jincheng Craft Cooperative as the king of domestic goods, with quality comparable to the best foreign brands but at a much lower price. Therefore, they are following suit and adopting the cooperative's Eagle brand six-color, nine-color, and twelve-color soft tube watercolor paints. It is also said that although the cooperative's products have been around for many years, they are constantly being innovated and improved to exceed standards, never resting on their laurels and becoming outdated. This is particularly commendable.</p>
<p>World Games Delegation Accompanying Notes (Letter 7)</p>
<p>Special Correspondent Feng Youzhen of the Central News Agency</p>
<p>(8) A Warm Welcome in Berlin</p>
<p>After a sleepless night on the train, we were inevitably tired. However, the warm welcome we received in Berlin at 9:00 AM on the 13th made everyone extremely excited and energized, forgetting all fatigue.</p>
<p>Our compatriots in Germany, including embassy staff, students, businessmen, and workers, felt a strong interest in the motherland's large-scale dispatch of a delegation to Germany to participate in the World Games. They organized a reception in advance to prepare for the welcome and reception procedures. The German side has always emphasized friendly relations, and of course, they wholeheartedly welcomed the athletes from a friendly country who came from afar.</p>
<p>At 9:15 AM, the special train arrived at the Berlin train station amidst great military music and waving national flags. Those who welcomed us on the platform included Dr. Ritter V. Hart, representative of the World Games Organizing Committee, representatives of the Berlin City Government, and Cheng Tianfang, our ambassador to Germany. Ding Wenyuan represented Dean Dai (who arrived in Berlin on July 7), along with representatives from more than 30 organizations. After the entire delegation got off the train, they lined up on the platform. Ms. Han, a student in Germany, presented flowers. Dr. Hart delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the German government and the World Games before broadcasting. Shen Siliang replied, and then led everyone to shout "Long live" for the two countries. After the ceremony, Li Huitang, the captain of the football team, led the way with the national flag given by Dean Chiang, and the entire team marched out of the station. More than 300 compatriots outside the station, all wearing national emblems and holding national flags, cheered loudly, creating a tense and enthusiastic atmosphere, which won unanimous praise from Berlin. The evening newspapers all used large headlines in the most conspicuous places to publish detailed news and various photos, praising it as the most enthusiastic and orderly scene of all the delegations that had arrived in Berlin.</p>
<p>After leaving the station, except for a dozen members of the sports inspection team who transferred to Hamburg, the remaining athletes and staff took three large buses to the Berlin City Government to hold a simple welcome ceremony in the city hall. Mayor Lippurt personally attended and delivered a speech with a very sincere attitude.</p>
<p>After bidding farewell to the city government, the entire group took a bus to the Olympic Village. The new village is 40 kilometers away from the city. We arrived at the new village at 11:15 AM. A row of A-shaped buildings was built in front. The flagpoles on both sides of the gate had raised the flags of 21 countries. After everyone got off the bus, they gathered in front of the gate. Governor Gilsa of the new village delivered a welcome speech, and Shen Siliang replied. Then, the military band played our national anthem and held a flag-raising ceremony. We stood solemnly, watching the flag of the blue sky and white sun slowly rise on the eleventh flagpole on the right. The joy in our hearts was indescribable. After the ceremony, the team marched to the dormitory. The band leading the way played melodious tunes. The athletes were energetic and marched in an orderly manner, attracting the attention of the athletes from various countries who had arrived in the new village. The distance from the gate of the new village to the dormitory was more than 1,000 meters. After arriving, another flag-raising ceremony was held, and then the team dispersed to their lodgings.</p>
<p>At 6:00 PM, the Chinese Embassy in Germany, the General Association of Students Studying in Europe, the Association of Students Studying in Germany, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce jointly held a tea party at the Wihelms Hotel near the new village to welcome the delegation and Dai Jitao and Mr. Lu. More than 500 people attended. Cheng Tianfang, the ambassador to Germany, presided over the meeting and delivered a welcome speech. Jiang Jun, a representative of the student association, also gave a speech. Dai and Zou, as well as Hao Gengsheng, a representative of the delegation, responded successively. The original text of Ambassador Cheng's speech is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Ambassador Cheng's Speech</p>
<p>Today, the German Embassy Party Department, the two student associations of overseas Chinese and German students, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce jointly held a tea party to welcome Mr. Dai Jitao, Mr. Zou Haibin, and all the staff and athletes of the Chinese delegation to the World Games. I feel exceptionally honored. Except for Mr. Zou, who came to Europe to attend the university conference and the World Education Conference, the rest came to participate in the World Games. This point makes Tianfang have a deep feeling in the welcome.</p>
<p>In ancient China, there was no distinction between civil and military affairs, so physical education was highly valued. Archery and horsemanship were listed alongside rites, music, writing, and arithmetic as the "Six Arts," which shows their importance. During the Spring and Autumn period, officials of various states were usually ministers, but once the country was in trouble, they would become generals and lead troops to resist foreign aggression. The general public was also able to take up arms to defend the country. This could not be done without emphasizing physical education in peacetime. Confucius, the greatest figure in our country, was also proficient in martial arts. Therefore, it is said that he practiced archery in Qu Xiang's garden, and the viewers were like a wall. His archery skills were evident. Descending to later generations, civil and military affairs were separated, and scholars regarded sports as a lowly matter and were unwilling to do it. They no longer paid attention to physical education, and the physical fitness of the people declined day by day. When there was foreign aggression, they could only bow their heads and beg for mercy, without any ability to resist. After the Song Dynasty, China was twice conquered by foreign races. The lack of physical education was an important reason. After the Yuan and Qing dynasties entered China, they were soon assimilated by the Chinese people. Therefore, the brave and strong style of the founding period changed into weakness and frailty in less than a hundred years. After the middle of the 19th century, we had more and more contact with Western nations, and we saw the prevalence of their martial spirit and the development of their national physique. The enlightened people woke up as if from a dream and realized the close relationship between physical education and the country, and they engaged in promotion. However, it was difficult to reverse the accumulated problems. The general public still did not develop the habit of making sports a part of daily life. Therefore, China has been promoting new education for forty or fifty years, and the results of physical education are far behind Western countries. Not only are Western-style sports inferior to others, but even our own traditional skills are almost lagging behind. For example, Japanese judo evolved from Chinese boxing, but today judo is far more popular in Japan than boxing in China. China invented bows and arrows before the West, but today there are still people practicing archery in the north, and it is impossible to buy bows and arrows south of the Yangtze River. Its decline is so great, while the United States is prospering and promoting it, and each university has archery clubs, and both male and female students join in and practice archery, which is popular for a while. Every time we think of these facts, we feel ashamed.</p>
<p>However, amidst the shame, there is something to comfort ourselves, and amidst the pessimism, there is something to be optimistic about. That is, in the recent ten years, our country's physical education has made significant progress. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it has known that physical education is the foundation of all undertakings, and it has spared no effort in promoting it. Therefore, since the September 18th Incident, although the national crisis has been serious, the national and provincial games have continued to be held, and the central government's funding for physical education has increased year by year. This year, it has allocated huge sums of money for the expenses of attending the World Games, so that you can come to Germany to participate. The results of the sports are naturally far from those of the advanced countries in physical education, but compared with ourselves, every time a sports meeting is held, there will be several new records, which is a manifestation of progress. Ball skills—especially football and basketball—have also improved a lot compared with ten years ago. In the Far East Games, we can often defeat foreigners. What is gratifying is that the sports atmosphere has gradually become popular, and the inherent national arts are gradually reviving, with more and more practitioners, and the physical fitness of the people is better than before, especially young women, who are no longer as weak as they used to be. All of these can be used for us to look forward to the future of the nation and be excited about it.</p>
<p>China is participating in the World Games for the third time. However, in the 9th World Games in 1928, our country only had staff. In the 10th World Games in 1932, our country only sent one athlete, Mr. Liu Changchun, which can only be regarded as spectators. This time, there are 70 male and female athletes, more than 20 staff members, 9 national arts performers, and more than 30 sports inspectors, totaling more than 140 people, which is a formal participation on an unprecedented scale. The National Government specially appointed Dean Dai Jitao as the government representative, expressing solemnity. When the delegation left the country, Dean Chiang personally presented the flag to encourage them. The newspapers reported the news of the delegation in detail every day. From this, we can see the high expectations of the government and the people for you, and the importance of your mission is self-evident.</p>
<p>Common people often say that the mission of the athletes of the Games is to win medals. Tianfang thinks otherwise. Since China is participating formally for the first time, it would be great if you can win medals. Even if you cannot win medals, the people of the country will never blame you. Your mission is elsewhere. When you were in Beijing, Dean Chiang once encouraged you to "win glory for the country in terms of moral spirit and discipline," and the German National Sports Director Asston also told his athletes to "show the spirit of the German nation through personality and life." Therefore, Tianfang believes that your mission is, on the one hand, on the sports field, in the dormitory, on the street, in the store, and in public places, every move and every action should show the spirit of neatness, solemnity, discipline, and responsibility, so that others will not have the slightest criticism, so that the German people and foreign guests will have a good influence on the Chinese people because of their contact with you. On the other hand, you should observe the spirit of the Germans and bring it back to China. We all know that Germany suffered a disastrous defeat in the national war, surrendered its weapons, paid compensation, and lost its rights and land, which was extremely painful. Now, in less than ten years, it has recovered remarkably. In recent years, its international status has improved a lot. This is the result of the Germans not being afraid of difficulties and setbacks, uniting under the leadership of the leader, and working hard. It is by no means a fluke. China today is at the juncture of survival and extinction, and it must also have the determination to unite, support the central government, obey the leader, and work hard to overcome the difficulties and restore the glorious position of the nation in history. After you return to China from Germany, you should do your best to promote this meaning. Those who go against this principle are public enemies of the country. If so, it will be easier to achieve the effect of resisting insults and saving the country. If you can achieve these two levels, then even if you do not win medals, the efforts you have made for the country will be very great. I wish you all the best in your efforts.</p>

<p>The Last Day of the September Term</p>
<p>The Margin Rate Falls by Forty Cents</p>
<p>Many Parties Take Profits While High</p>
<p>The Swap Rate Once Did 1.5 Yuan Weak</p>
<p>But Still Required More Than 2 Yuan at the End</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market fell by forty cents due to many parties taking profits while high. However, it rose slightly in the middle due to continued absorption by the central government. The trend was erratic. In the early morning, the overseas silver market was reported to have shrunk in Britain and remained flat in the United States. The price of Monte Rei forward silver was unchanged and shrunk by two-thousandths of a point, etc. The exchange rate was flat, the price of London raw gold was unchanged, and the Central Bank's listing price was announced. The exchange rates between Britain and the United States were both flat, and the customs gold unit was unchanged. The listing price of the standard margin was still 1124.9 yuan. Da Decheng Sheng Yuan Yong purchased the terms and rose to 7 yuan. In the morning opening, the sellers were slightly more active and fell slightly. However, due to the Central Bank's cash payment, the spot firms took the opportunity to rush in and gradually rebounded. The listing price of the HSBC Bank was announced, and the exchange rates between Britain and the United States were both flat and changed. Before long, many parties sold out while high. The silver balance tax was announced to have shrunk by 0.025 yuan and gradually fell. However, the situation was sluggish in the middle. At noon, the floating interest rate was closed and turned weak. Because the Central Bank successively opened cash, the current term swap rate caused the spot firms to rush to cover their short positions and posted in succession. The market was only 1.5 yuan weak. However, the official opening was posted out by the long parties at 2 yuan to 1.1 yuan. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The opening in the morning was 1127.1 yuan, an increase of 0.3 yuan compared to the previous closing. Huixiang Yisheng traded at 7.2 yuan, selling to 6.7 yuan. Shengyuan Yongfu Taiheng Da Decheng purchased the terms and rose to 7.4 yuan. The listing price of the HSBC Bank was announced, and the market between Britain and the United States was flat. Yuanmao Yongyu Xinxing Da Decheng Huiyuan Shen Da Yongde Mao Yong successively took sharp actions. The silver balance tax also fell by a small amount of 0.025 yuan step by step. The noon closing fell to 1126.4 yuan.</p>
<p>The settlement price was that the standard margin price of the Central Bank was still listed at 224.9 yuan. According to the closing price, it was raised by 1.5 yuan. The registration price for this month was 1124 yuan, for September 1126 yuan, and for October 1128 yuan. The market situation for the morning water replenishment was stable. The price of Tianjin goods was 15 yuan higher. The buying price of cooked silk was 14 yuan, and the selling price was 16.5 yuan. Both lacked opponents.</p>
<p>There was limited trading in the market. In summary, Futaiheng Futai, Yong (allocated to Sifeng Heng a total of more than 400 shares), Da Decheng Yicheng Yuanmao Yong and others were on the buying side, and Qingfa Yongfu Yu Heng Yu Huixiang Yuxin Xiang and others were on the selling side.</p>
<p>It was found that the market situation was the opposite of fatigue after the half-day market. The opening in the morning was 1127.1 yuan, and the afternoon was 226.4 yuan. The highest was 1127.4 yuan, and the lowest was 1126.4 yuan, with a fluctuation of 1 yuan. The result was a setback of 0.4 yuan.</p>
<p>The September to October term market was predicted outside the market. Because the Central Bank's cash payment caused the spot firms to scramble to post in their short term labels, only 1.4 yuan was posted in by the short parties, which was posted in by Shengyuan Yong. Qiafeng Yong Wanxing Shen Lian Qingfa Yong posted out and rose to 1.8 yuan. Yicheng Jingfu Qian Changxiang Dafeng Heng Shengyuan Yong came to post in again and fell to 1.5 yuan. Qiafeng Yong Wu Changxiang Shen Kang Fu Yu posted out and rose to 1.9 yuan. Tongfeng Heng Da Decheng Shengyuan Yong also posted in, but Qiafeng Yong Wan Wan Fuxing Yongheng Chang Yong and others all came to post out. The official opening of the ten-point chain was posted out by the long parties at 2 yuan. After the opening, Chunyuan Yongfu Yu Da Heng posted in and fell to 1.9 yuan. Yuxin Xiang Fuxing Yong Yuanmao Yong Ding Kang retail investors posted out and once rose to 2.5 yuan. Before long, Yuanmao Yong Da Decheng posted in and fell to 2 yuan. Heng Chang Yong took the opportunity to post out at a low price, and the noon closing was posted out by the long parties at 2.1 yuan.</p>
<p>As for the September term notes that have not been properly exchanged, the long parties accounted for more than 700 shares of Da Changxiang, more than 400 shares of Qiafeng Yongfu Taiheng each, more than 300 shares of Qingfa Yong, and more than 200 shares of Xianghe Da Decheng Fu Da Yuxinxiang each, more than 100 shares of Yuanmao Yong, and the short parties accounted for more than 900 shares of Jingfu, more than 800 shares of Yicheng, more than 300 shares of Dashun Huixiang each, more than 200 shares of Qian Changxiang Chunyuan Yong each, and more than 100 shares of Ruixing, The total number was 3423 shares. There were 18 long parties and 21 short parties. The total number of transactions was 12,782 shares.</p>
<p>The new lineup for the October term market included long parties who accounted for 1400 shares of Qiafeng and Yong, less than 1200 shares of Fuxing, more than 700 shares of Heng Chang Yong, more than 600 shares of Huixiang, more than 500 shares of Wanxing and Wu Changxiang each, more than 400 shares of Ding Kang, less than 400 shares of Shen Kang, more than 200 shares of Shunli Tongtai Chang Yuanmao Yong each, and more than 100 shares of Da Cheng Yuqing Yong Yuan Heng Da Shun Qingfa Yong Ju Da Yuxinxiang each. The short parties accounted for more than 1200 shares of Tongfeng Heng Chunyuan Yong each, more than 900 shares of Da Decheng Yicheng each, more than 400 shares of Shengyuan Yong, less than 400 shares of Lifeng, more than 200 shares of Yiyu Futaiheng Dafeng Heng Yuan Chang Yong Jingfu each, and more than 100 shares of Tianfa Daheng Jinfeng Yongrun Chang Yu each. The total number of chips was 9903 shares. There were 27 long positions and 40 short positions.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Rates Showed No Change in the Near or Distant Future</p>
<p>The exchange rate market yesterday saw varying levels of bank trading, with many still swapping terms, resulting in a lack of change. Initially, overseas telegrams indicated that the London large bar had shrunk by 0.0625 in both near and distant terms, the New York silver market remained unchanged, Monte Rei's forward silver prices were unchanged and shrunk by 0.002, etc. The London raw gold price was unchanged, the British exchange rate against the US dollar was unchanged, the US dollar against the British pound shrank by 0.0625, the British exchange rate against the French franc was unchanged, and the US dollar against the French franc increased by half a point. The Central Bank's listing prices showed that the exchange rates between the British pound and the US dollar were flat, and the customs gold unit was unchanged. In the morning opening, the near-term selling price of the British exchange rate was one shilling, two pence, 4.0625, and the US exchange rate was thirty yuan, 15625. Compared to the previous closing, the exchange rates between the British pound and the US dollar were flat. After the opening, banks slightly released some funds, but there was no impact. The HSBC Bank's listing prices showed that the exchange rates between the British pound and the US dollar were flat. Later, the silver balance tax was announced to have shrunk by 0.0025. Foreign firms and banks traded US dollar forward, and Dongfang also made an August British pound and US dollar exchange rate swap at five yuan, 0.0275, causing the process to hover. At noon closing, the near-term selling price of the British exchange rate was one shilling, two pence, 4.0625, and the US exchange rate was thirty yuan, 15625. Compared to the previous closing, the exchange rates between the British pound and the US dollar were flat, and the quick exchange rates were the same. Chinese merchants slightly increased the shilling rate. The transaction records for the first half of the day are recorded as follows:</p>

The buying price was added 0.0625.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<p>The Financial World Sells Public Bonds Again</p>
<p>Yesterday, the atmosphere in the Chinese Stock Exchange initially showed a gradual decline. Then, the mad selling of No. 4 fully represented the outflow of spot goods in the financial world. The trend became increasingly weak. The long-awaited signs of the times were not obvious, so the sale of spot goods was already visible. The coming of the fluctuation should not be far away. After the opening yesterday, the selling of No. 4, No. 35, and No. 10 was met with few buyers. The market price unanimously tended to be weak, mostly falling by one to three corners. The closing price was stable and firm at the beginning. Since the beginning of this month's C type, No. 4 suddenly had a large number of sales, the number of which was insignificant, which was obviously the outflow of spot goods. The market price then turned to a weak path. The future is at the turning point, which is at present. Moreover, it is also the time when the delivery is gradually approaching. It is feared that there will be a relatively large change. The market price result was that only the D type forward price was good by 0.05 yuan. The rest fell unanimously, calculated from a small amount of 0.1 yuan to 0.4 yuan. The total number of transactions was 3,925,000 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared in the table on the left. (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: 100 Yuan)</p>

<p>Responsible Sales are Still Smooth and the Closing Price Recovers Slightly</p>
<p>But the Month Still Falls by 1.3 Yuan</p>
<p>The yarn market started to fall and then continued. The situation was still high. The sales of good yarn developed. In view of the expectation that agricultural products will have a bumper harvest this year, the economy of the farmers can be substantially rich, and the sales of yarn in the autumn must be prosperous. Therefore, most people have been paying close attention to the future yarn recently. Shenxin Factory has exclusively opened 14,500 packages of 20-count people's bell double horse yarn for the October to December term during these two days.</p>

<p>Local Supplement of Shen Bao Amateur Weekly World Knowledge The Conquest of the Arctic Ocean by Zhu</p>
<p>The Arctic Ocean, due to its harsh climate and perennial ice and snow, is inaccessible to humans. In the past, it was a mysterious and unknown world. Some, seeing the aurora in the Arctic sky, claimed the Arctic Ocean to be the northern end of the world. Others, observing its prolonged darkness, believed the opposite shore of the Arctic Ocean to be hell, where the wicked would be escorted after death to suffer. In the area of Dudora, a legend circulated: "From the Kola Peninsula to hell is three hundred versts, a desolate and extremely cold region." This was the popular conception of the Arctic Ocean.</p>
<p>The mystery of the Arctic Ocean piqued the curiosity of Europeans: What kind of world is the Arctic Ocean? To answer this question, they embarked on expeditions. In 1596, the Dutchman Barents ventured to 79.40 degrees north latitude (713 miles from the North Pole). In 1909, the American Peary reached the exact North Pole at 90 degrees. Subsequently, many explorers passed through the Arctic region. The so-called secrets of the Arctic Ocean gradually became known.</p>
<p>However, the aforementioned Arctic explorers were driven by curiosity and a desire for fame. Consequently, besides learning about whales spouting water, polar bears roaring, and other strange phenomena, they paid little attention to the Arctic Ocean's significance to human life. Naturally, they gave no thought to conquering the region to benefit humanity. Only the Soviet Union, with its planned and organized investigations, explorations, and conquests of the Arctic Ocean, genuinely pursued exploration and conquest for practical purposes.</p>
<p>When the Soviet people began exploring the Arctic Ocean, many practical questions arose in their minds: What is the terrain and geology of the Arctic Ocean coastline? Besides what is already known, are there any new rivers or islands along the Arctic Ocean coast? Are there errors in past maps of the Arctic Ocean? What marine animals and fish live in the Arctic Ocean? What minerals are buried in the lands along the Arctic Ocean? How can navigation be achieved amidst the vast ice floes of the Arctic Ocean? How can one live in the ice and snow of the Arctic Ocean coastline? They explored the Arctic Ocean under these practical questions and, in the process, gradually answered them concretely.</p>
<p>First, the Soviet people needed a lot of meat. Therefore, the Soviet state vigorously encouraged people to raise livestock. At one time, they focused on raising rabbits, but even then, they could not quickly satisfy the great need. This led to the first task of conquering the Arctic Ocean: striving to capture the marine animals there.</p>
<p>The Arctic Ocean is rich in marine animals such as whales, seals, walruses, and polar bears, found almost everywhere. The Soviet Union used scientific methods to capture them systematically, which was not only crucial in solving the food problem but also produced a large quantity of fur, addressing the problem of keeping the Soviet people warm. Without a large amount of marine animal fur, the Soviet people would have found it difficult to cope with the terrible cold of minus thirty or forty degrees.</p>
<p>Secondly, many rivers in Siberia flow into the Arctic Ocean. Along those rivers are vast, untouched primeval forests. The wood of cold-climate trees is extremely fine and sturdy, making it an excellent building material. However, the timber from these areas could not be transported by the Siberian Railway. It was necessary to open steamer routes in the Arctic Ocean for transportation. After conquering the Arctic Ocean, the Soviet Union adopted scientific methods to systematically harvest and transport timber from those forests. This not only alleviated the shortage of much-needed building materials in the Soviet Union but also enabled it to export large quantities of timber to Western European countries.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Soviet Union gradually discovered that many minerals, such as coal and rock salt, were buried along the Arctic Ocean coastline. The amount of these resources is unknown, but they will be gradually exploited and enjoyed by humanity as the Soviet Union's construction develops.</p>
<p>Finally, the Soviet Union's conquest of the Arctic Ocean has gradually raised the cultural living standards of many barbarian tribes there. This further demonstrates its greatness.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the Five-Year Plan is the guideline for the Soviet Union's efforts in economic construction. Within the Five-Year Plan, there is a clear section on the investigation, research, and conquest of the polar regions and the Arctic Ocean. This shows how much attention and effort the Soviet Union is putting into the work of conquering the Arctic Ocean. Here are some of the major Arctic Ocean expeditions undertaken by the Soviet Union in recent years:</p>
<p>The 1930 expedition of the icebreaker Sedov.</p>
<p>In 1932, the voyages of the icebreakers Taimyr, Krasin, and Sibiryakov encountered obstacles.</p>
<p>In 1933, the Sibiryakov safely reached its destination. However, in late June of the same year, another ship was trapped in ice near the Chukchi Peninsula. Fortunately, through the efforts of the Soviet people, all personnel were rescued.</p>
<p>Since then, in 1934, 1935, and recently, the Soviet Union has continued its efforts to conquer the Arctic Ocean, despite encountering many difficulties and dangers. Currently, aircraft bases and wireless telegraph offices are established throughout the Arctic Ocean coastline, equipped with many ships for capturing marine animals and whales, icebreakers, and aircraft, all striving to capture various marine animals. As for the various minerals buried underground along the Arctic Ocean coastline and those vast forests, they are, of course, being investigated and harvested. Thus, the hell-like Arctic Ocean, under the Soviet people's efforts to conquer it, is becoming an increasingly useful place for humanity.</p>
<p>Economic Exchange Recent World Trade Overview by Yi Ping</p>
<p>With the increase in industrial production and the rise in prices, the long-stagnant world trade has begun to show signs of improvement since the third quarter of last year. However, looking at the individual situations of capitalist countries, the development of trade is very uneven. For example, the Gold Bloc countries (France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, etc.) have not seen any increase in their foreign trade, even as the total volume of world trade has begun to increase. However, countries that have abandoned the gold standard have shown a clear increase in their foreign trade. Let us first take the United States as an example.</p>
<p>In recent years, the United States, due to currency devaluation and vigorous inflation, has seen the following increase in its foreign trade: (Unit: Millions of US Dollars)</p>
<p>From the table above, it can be seen that the United States' foreign trade has been increasing since 1934. However, one point worth noting in this increase is that the increase in exports last year was very small, especially when compared to the increase in imports, resulting in a significant decrease in last year's trade surplus. What is the reason for this? Apart from the fact that Roosevelt's policy of reducing agricultural production led to a decrease in agricultural exports, one of the reasons is that the domestic and foreign markets have shrunk, so even the inflation policy could not promote a continued large increase in exports.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the United Kingdom. In the gradual improvement of the world economy, the United Kingdom is one of the countries that has shown the most obvious improvement. Similarly, its foreign trade has also shown an increasing trend. According to a recent report by the British Secretary of Commerce, Mr. Runciman, the United Kingdom's share of world export trade was 9.9 percent in 1932, and by last year, it had increased to 10.8 percent. Regarding this year, according to Mr. Runciman's analysis: "In the first six months of 1936, compared with 1935, although the increase in export trade is not as fast as in recent years, it is still increasing. The total value of exports from January to June 1935 was £206,500,000, while in the same period this year, it increased to £207,900,000. The increase in imports was even greater than that in exports. Imports of food, beverages, and tobacco increased from £166,000,000 to £179,000,000. Imports of raw materials and semi-finished goods increased from £103,000,000 to £119,000,000. Imports of fully or mostly manufactured goods increased from approximately £88,000,000 to £101,000,000. Although exports increased by only £1,400,000, this should not be considered a completely unfavorable situation. One of the reasons for the slow growth is that export trade to Italy was temporarily completely halted, with a reduction of £4,000,000 compared to the first half of last year. Although the trade deficit has increased from £124,000,000 to £162,000,000, it is not possible to predict any serious unfavorable balance of payments within the year...". This analysis cannot be entirely believed, but the increase in British trade in recent years is a fact. As for the main reason for the slower increase in exports in the first half of this year, it is indeed due to the reduction in exports to Italy. This may be why British imperialism is eager to lift sanctions against Italy, attempting to</p>
<h3>Wuxi Substitution of the Director of Public Security</h3>
<p>Chen Yuchu, the Director of Public Security of Wuxi County, was transferred to be the Director of Public Security of Changshu. The vacancy was filled by Zhang Da, the former Director of Public Security of Kunshan County, who came to Wuxi to take over. After receiving the order, Zhang arrived in Wuxi the day before yesterday afternoon, and immediately went to the Commissioner's Office and the County Government to pay respects to Commissioner Zang and County Magistrate Long for instructions. Then he went to the County Public Security Bureau to visit Director Chen and discuss handover matters. That evening, Director Chen convened a meeting of the heads of the various sub-bureaus in the urban area to report on the significance of the Civil Affairs Department's change to police-administered areas, and advised them to be at ease and not to panic themselves. On the morning of the 15th, Yang Yuanpei, the supervisor appointed by the Civil Affairs Department, arrived in Wuxi from the province. At 8:30, Zhang, accompanied by the representative of the Civil Affairs Department, went to the bureau to take over. Director Chen handed over the seals and all important official documents one by one, and then resigned. The assistants of the new director who have been announced are Chuan Boliang as the head of the Second Section, Jin Lunyuan as the head of the Third Section, and Tang Heling as the head of the First Public Security Sub-bureau and acting Inspector General. The head of the First Section is Lin from the province, who is expected to arrive on the morning of the 16th. Zhang Ruifu is the Inspector and Captain of the Special Task Force, and Lu Han is in charge of general affairs. In addition, more than 30 police officers from the Provincial Police Academy who were brought along will be assigned to the Inspectorate and various sub-bureaus in the urban area. Former Director Chen left for Yu on the morning of the 16th to take up his new post.</p>
<p>Urgent Appeal to Abolish Household Donation</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in order to expand the police funding of various counties, added a household property donation. Zhenjiang and Kunshan counties were the first to collect it, and the two counties telegraphed all counties to strive for consistency. The local Chamber of Commerce has always considered that the Jiangsu Provincial Government's reorganization of property donations and the addition of household donations clearly exceed the scope of reorganization and have not gone through legal procedures. The matter concerns the burden of the people and affects more than just one county. Most of the urban households in Wuxi are engaged in industry and commerce. The original small property donation was used to provide security funding. If household donations are added again, it will inevitably repeat the same mistake as setting up a separate budget for security funding. It is a budget outside the budget, an extra levy on top of levies, which increases the burden on the people and nullifies the central government's previous achievements in abolishing harsh and miscellaneous taxes. Moreover, the central government's income tax is bound to be levied, and the Jiangsu Provincial land tax is also being discussed to be reduced. However, the people's resources are limited, and how can they bear the heavy burden? Yesterday, the Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Department of Finance, and the Jiangsu Provincial Donation and Tax Supervision Committee, urging them to investigate and clarify whether the counties in Jiangsu Province have existing household property donations. If not, they should be ordered to stop them uniformly. Before legal procedures have been completed, the government has no right to enforce it, and the people have no reason to obey it. This would bring everything into order and avoid further burdening the local area.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Villagers Riot at Corpse Examination Site</h3>
<p>Sun Xiaolong, a resident of Chouxiangli Village, Shijuzhen, Third District, Wuyi County, suddenly died. His wife, Zhu, only learned from neighbors after the coffin was prepared and buried that he had been beaten and seriously injured by Luo Husheng and others, and died the next day. Zhu immediately reported to the Third Police Station of the Public Security Bureau, which forwarded the report to the local court to send someone to examine the body. Guan Junjie, a prosecutor from the local court, led forensic officer Shen Shaochun and bailiffs to the village on the morning of the 14th. After arriving at the corpse examination site, he first summoned the deceased's family members for questioning, and then ordered the coffin to be opened and the body to be carried out for examination according to law. The family members asked the forensic officer if there were any injuries. The officer replied that he had not seen any injuries yet, as the examination had not been completed. However, those related to the family members saw two bruises on the lower abdomen of the body, which led to misunderstandings. The spectators at the site also felt injustice. Then the forensic officer announced that there were two injuries on the lower abdomen, which were caused by pressure injuries before death, and he died the next day. At this time, someone started a riot and resorted to violence at the site. The order was immediately in chaos. Prosecutor Guan was pushed and fell into the field, and his clothes were torn. The clerk and bailiffs were beaten and fled to hide. Fortunately, the police officers from the Third Police Station of the Public Security Bureau were at the scene for emergency defense and fired shots into the sky to suppress the situation. The villagers dispersed and fled. Prosecutor Guan and others were escorted by the police to a car and returned to the city. It is reported that several people who caused the riot at the site have been arrested and sent to the court for investigation on the 15th. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, in view of the water conservancy work in various counties, believes that Jiangyin has achieved the most remarkable results. Therefore, there is a motive to set it as a model county for water conservancy. The Department of Construction is currently instructing the relevant departments to make detailed plans, but it is still necessary to send personnel to Cheng to conduct on-the-spot investigations of the water conservancy projects to conduct research so that all counties can use it as a model.</p>
<h3>Wanyuan Collective Interrogation of False Accusation Case</h3>
<p>The case of alleged forgery of documents and false accusations against former trial judge Zhou Xiangshi Wending, and lawyer Deng Zesan, etc., has been judged by the Wuxi Court. Zhou was fined 250 yuan, Shi Wending was sentenced to two months of imprisonment, Huang Shaoying was sentenced to three years, Er Nian was sentenced to two years, and Kao Gongsan was found not guilty. Prosecutor Shen Ming believes that the original judgment was too lenient and appealed to the High Court. The hearing is now scheduled for 8:00 AM on the 26th, and Wang Jiajun and Chen Yipeng, Yuan Quanmei, and Wu Shunsheng, a teahouse attendant at the Huayuan Hotel, have been summoned to court for questioning. The Zhenyang Long-Distance Bus Company, which recently undertook the Yanghuo Line, has completed the construction of the road surface and is scheduled to have a trial run for one week starting from September 1, before officially opening to traffic. The road is 10 kilometers long and has a total of five stations along the way. In addition to the "Yang" and "Huo" stations at the starting and ending points, which are manned by company staff, the remaining Xu Ningmen, Huanjiaqiao, Gaoju, and three stations are managed by local people. The fare is said to be 6 cents from Yang to Xu Ningmen, 11 cents from Xu Ningmen to Huanjiaqiao, 10 cents from Huanjiaqiao to Gaoqiao, and 13 cents from Gaoqiao to Huojiaqiao. The total fare for the entire route is 40 cents in silver dollars. It is learned that the company is offering a 20% discount to passengers. It is expected that once this route is open, most of the passengers and goods traveling along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River from Yang to various ports in Shanghai will no longer need to go through Zhenjiang and the canal.</p>
<h3>Nantong Suppression of the Sijiao Mutiny</h3>
<p>The Sijiao police in the Fifth District of Chongming, Nantong, suddenly mutinied and shot and killed the water police squad leader Shen and the district chief Ling Pengcheng. The situation is quite serious. The Fourth District Security Command often sends staff officer Zhang Weiqun on the Haiying warship to cooperate with the Second Brigade of the Third District Water Police to suppress the mutiny.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Overseas Chinese Inspection Group Resistance</h3>
<p>A group of fifteen people from the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Motherland Inspection Group, led by the head of the group, Chen Chunhai, arrived in Hangzhou by the Shanghai-Hangzhou express train at 12:30 noon yesterday (the 15th). The Hangzhou Municipal Government specially sent Commissioner Zeng Guanguang to the station to welcome them. After getting off the train, the members of the group went to the Dielai Hotel to rest. They are scheduled to visit various scenic spots in West Lake on the 16th and visit various new constructions on the 17th. They will stay in Hangzhou for several days.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Jianglu Fire</h3>
<p>Dafeng Department Store at No. 43, Benbei River, is operated by Yong natives Chen Jirong and Shi Wanji with Taiwanese capital. Ba Li has been in charge for five or six years, also serving as manager. His family also lives in the store. Business is doing quite well. They have insurance from Ba Li Insurance Company for 3,000 yuan worth of goods and 1,500 yuan worth of business assets from the Siming Insurance Company. Next door is Zhou Wenxing, who runs a vegetable stall, and his twelve-year-old daughter live there. There is only one board separating them, with a door connecting them, so they often visit each other. At around 10:00 PM on the 13th, Chen, a junior owner of Dafeng, suddenly invited friends to Zhou Wenxing's bedroom to play mahjong until after 1:00 AM, when they finished the game and went out for a late-night snack. Unexpectedly, the bedroom suddenly caught fire, and in an instant, it broke through the roof. After the various Yilong heard the alarm and rushed to the rescue, it took more than an hour to extinguish the fire. It is estimated that two buildings of Dafeng Department Store, one building of Zhou Wenxing, and two buildings of Zhang Yiyu's cigarette and paper shop were destroyed, with losses of nearly 10,000 taels of gold. The cause of the fire is under investigation.</p>
<h3>Bengbu Police Donation Transferred to Tax Bureau for Collection</h3>
<p>The police donation of the Bengbu Public Security Bureau used to be collected by personnel sent by the Donation Affairs Office. The Anhui Provincial Government has clearly ordered that the police donation be collected by the collection agency. The bureau recently abolished the Donation Affairs Office and dismissed the donation collection personnel with salaries. From August of this year, all police donations will be transferred to the Fengyang Business Tax Collection Bureau for collection. The five types of additional fees that are close to harsh and miscellaneous taxes, such as vehicle and grain tax, copper stove donation, street cleaning donation, ship donation, and livestock slaughter donation, have been ordered to be stopped uniformly. There are currently thirteen types of legal police donations collected by the Fengyang Business Tax Collection Bureau, namely, housing and shop rent, rickshaw donation, automobile donation, fertilizer donation, banquet donation, restaurant donation, hotel donation, entertainment donation, singing donation, public land rent, public housing rent, salt tax, and health inspection fee. Receipts are issued by the Finance Department in triplicate and reported monthly to ensure that every penny goes to the public. The expenses of the Fengyang Business Tax Bureau for collecting police donations each month shall not exceed one-quarter of the previous expenses of the Donation Affairs Office of the Public Security Bureau, so as to save money and increase police salaries. The monthly police salaries of the Public Security Bureau will be allocated by the Business Tax Bureau.</p>

<h3>Citizen Oath Registration Begins Today in Various Organizations Citizen Registration in Each District Scheduled for the 18th</h3>
<p>Today is the third day of the citizen oath registration in this city, and various professional organizations are beginning to hold it. At 9:00 AM yesterday, the ten district party headquarters and one directly affiliated branch in the city convened the executive committee members of their respective district branches to take the oath and register. Approximately 1,000 people participated. At 9:00 AM this morning, officials from the Municipal Farmers' Association and various district farmers' associations and fishermen's associations jointly took the oath at the Farmers' Association. Officials from the General Labor Union and various industry labor unions, and officials from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various industry guilds, held the event at their respective associations. Officials from the Municipal Education Association and various district education associations also held the event at the same time at the association on Daji Road.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's Schedule</p>
<p>Tomorrow (the 17th), free professional organizations will take the oath, including (1) executive and supervisory committee members and staff and all members of the Accounting Association, (2) all executive and supervisory committee members, staff, and members of the Physicians and Pharmacists Association, (3) all executive and supervisory committee members, staff, and members of the Chinese Medicine Association, and (4) all executive and supervisory committee members, staff, and members of the Journalists Association. Except for the Journalists Association, which is scheduled to hold the event at 4:00 PM due to the nature of the profession, the venue for the Physicians and Pharmacists Association oath has been changed to the Physicians Association Auditorium at No. 41 Chihama Road due to the original Physicians Association venue being insufficient. The rest will be held at their respective associations at 9:00 AM. The National Election Office has appointed He Yuanming, Mao Yun, Yu Zhongbiao, and Huang Xianggu to supervise the oath-taking at that time. All staff and members of the various associations have also been notified by the associations and must attend.</p>
<p>Citizen Registration</p>
<p>Regarding citizen registration, the National Election Office has already established methods and published a notice in the newspaper today. The original text is as follows: National Assembly Shanghai Municipal Representative Election Office Notice No. 9. It has been determined by this office that the dates for citizen registration in this city are August 18 and 19. The registration procedure is as follows: the first day is for distributing registration forms and oaths, and the second day is for collecting registration forms (oaths are not collected). All citizens of this city who are 20 years old or older must fill out the registration form immediately in accordance with the law when they receive it (the "What professional organization member" column does not need to be filled out if you have not joined an organization. If you have joined an organization, you must indicate it in order to participate in professional elections). The next day, the form collectors will collect the forms. The oath-taking date will be announced separately. This citizen registration is related to the election administration. Citizens who have not taken the oath and registered have no right to vote or be elected. Also, this registration does not charge any fees. Please be informed. Director Wu Tiecheng, August 15.</p>
<p>Registration Notice</p>
<p>Yesterday, a person in charge of the office stated that in the citizen oath registration form, there is a column for "What professional organization member". If the registrant has not joined a professional organization, they should fill in "None". If they have joined, they must indicate it in order to participate in professional elections in the future. According to the Election Law Article 5 "Those who have the right to vote in both regional elections and professional elections should participate in professional elections," it is inevitable that both parties will lose the right to vote in the future. Therefore, in addition to the corrections that have been made, it is hoped that all registrants will pay attention to it in the future.</p>

<h3>The Coal Mining Industry Joint Office Held its Second Representative Congress Yesterday Elected Chairman and Passed Articles of Association</h3>
<p>In accordance with the resolution of the National Mining Conference convened by the Ministry of Industry on June 1, and with the Ministry sending personnel to unite various mines, the Coal Mining Industry Joint Office of the Republic of China was formed. The second representative congress was held yesterday morning. Director Cheng of the Ministry of Industry attended the meeting to preside over the congress. The articles of association were passed and the chairman and vice-chairmen and the preparatory personnel of the branch offices were elected. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Representatives Present</p>
<p>The representatives present yesterday were Guo Fangke (Ping Mining Bureau), He Liwen (Fuguo Coal Mine), Xia Jiliang (Jingxing Mining Bureau), Xu Zhongling (Jinhe Coal Mine), Zhou Fengzhang (Mentougou Coal Mine), Zhou Liangchai (Pingding Baojin Company), Lu Bingru (Datong Company Jinbei Mining Bureau), Zhang Zhongping, He Shoukang (Zhongxing Lihua Company), Li Zucai (Yili Company), Zhu Yonghe (Datong Company), Chen Hansan (Yuanhua Company), Gu Zhen, Sun Mou (Kailuan Mining Bureau), Zhang Hu (Lieshan Coal Mine), Gao Hechao (Huafeng Company), Dai Linshu (Huadong Company), Li Guangqi (Liuhegou Company), Tong Kangling (Dule Company), Meng Xinzhi (Zhongfu Company), and Cheng Yifa, Director of the Mining Department of the Ministry of Industry, a total of twenty-one people. Director Cheng presided over the meeting, and Zhu Jichi, secretary of the joint association, recorded the meeting. The meeting started at 10:00 AM and adjourned at 1:00 PM. It resumed at 3:00 PM and adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After opening the meeting and performing the rituals, Chairman Cheng Yifa first reported that the Ministry of Industry, in view of the decline of domestic coal and the dumping of foreign coal, believed that if measures were not taken to remedy the situation urgently, the national mining industry would be bankrupted. Therefore, it specially convened national mine owners to gather in Beijing for discussions. It was generally agreed that if remedies were to be sought, unified marketing was essential to achieve results. Therefore, it was specially decided to establish a joint office to conduct overall planning and eliminate the long-standing problems of each acting on its own and not coordinating with each other. Two preparatory meetings have already been held, a draft of the articles of association has been drawn up, and it has been decided to set up a general office in Shanghai and branch offices in Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, Hankou, Guangdong, Fujian, Qingdao, and Jinan to facilitate planning, cooperation, management, and marketing in the vicinity. However, the articles of association are the norm for the entire enterprise. Unless they are discussed in detail, it is difficult to be comprehensive. The relationship with the entire mining industry is extremely important, and it is hoped that everyone will express their opinions and jointly plan the progress.</p>
<p>Resolutions</p>
<p>After discussion, (1) the chairman reported on the drafting and process of the articles of association and read them item by item. After public modification, they were passed by the whole body, and it was agreed that the joint office would be established immediately.
