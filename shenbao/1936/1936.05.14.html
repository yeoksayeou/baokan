<h3>上海之玻璃製造業</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信　主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概况之二十四）</p>
<p>三·晶華玻璃廠——該廠成立於民國二十一年七月，為徐肇龢王敬業等所主辦。設廠址於白利南路一四五九號。資本原為五萬元，現擬增至二十五萬元。現由徐冠南氏任董事長，徐肇龢任經理，其出品以玻璃瓶為主，每年營業額，達二三十萬元云。</p>
<p>四·晶鑫玻璃廠——該廠係周文美君獨資經營，創設於民國二十一年九月，開始資本約一萬餘元，現達五萬餘元，廠址在小沙渡六七九弄一〇〇號。建有爐灶二座，製瓶機器十五，專製各式玻璃瓶類，行銷本埠及華南長江各埠。</p>
<p>五·光明製造水瓶電器有限公司——該廠於民國十四年成立，係雷炳林吳鼎銘等發起組織，資本十八萬元，廠赴為閘北靑雲路一一〇號房間。該廠廠屋基地，均係已產，雇有男女工人二百餘名，目下專製造冷熱水瓶，每年營業額，達三十餘萬元云。</p>
<p>玻璃販賣與市况——本埠各玻璃廠之出品，如前所述，以瓶，杯，盆，缸等器皿為主，因相繼改進之結果，頗能與外貨（尤其是日貨）競爭。至其銷路則多半限於本埠及江浙兩省，他如九江，蕪湖，漢口等地，雖有運往，但為數有奶，僅及本埠之五六成。本埠各廠對於出貨之推銷，計分三種，一為定貨交易，二為批發交易，三為兜銷交易。定貨交易，即欲定貨者，擬定製何種玻璃器，親自向廠家接洽，商定價格。定貨之價格，貨品體積至大者，以每件計價，普通大小以每打計價，特別小者如十滴水瓶之類，則以百數計價。自志交至交貨，期間長短不一，大槪為三星期。批發交易，則先由買主向廠方說明擬購品名，以便審別其貨質好壞，合意後再接洽件數與價格，至成交後貨物，有由廠方運送，有由買主自行取回，原無一定。兜銷交易普通乃小玻璃廠所採用，其法乃先由廠方雇用兜銷夫，每日掮挑玻璃製品，向中上雜貨店兜銷，成交數額不若批發交易之大。至平板玻璃，前一方之，十九皆由外洋輸入，今將四號原片玻璃過去一年之售價列後，以供參攷（以百方呎計價，價格單位元）</p>
<p>廿四年一月　七·八〇　七月　六·〇〇</p>
<p>二月　七·八〇　八月　六·〇〇</p>
<p>三月　七·四〇　九月　六·二〇</p>
<p>四月　七·四〇　十月　六·二〇</p>
<p>五月　六·八〇　十一月　七·一〇</p>
<p>六月　六·〇〇　十二月　七·一〇</p>
<p>註：數字根據國定稅則委員會編上海物價月報。</p>
<p>本年來價格仍有上漲，一月為七·二五，二月為七·三〇，三月為七·五〇，此與法幣滙價，蓋有密切相關。</p>
<p>此外關於碎玻璃之進口及其市價，亦頗値一述。碎玻璃主要自美國輸入，每年約四五百噸，專供本埠各廠用作原料，目下時價，每噸約美金十四元左右。本埠各廠為减輕成本，往往收買本埠之碎玻璃，以其售價遠較美貨為廉也。本埠經營碎玻璃進口者，現僅四川路二一五號之大方進出口行一家云。（完）</p>

<h3>田徑訓練班　第三次成績測驗記</h3>

<p>打破紀錄一　一千五百公尺賈連仁、以四分十三秒創全國之新紀錄、競賽時、老將劉長春與賈週旋、第一圈與第三圈、劉已汗流夾跑、但賈則視若無事、逐步進行、最初三百公尺、賈之速度四十五秒、至七百公尺時、計一分四十秒、至一千一百公尺時為三分正、當塲情續緊張、劉亦加油、惟抵終點時、賈以四分十三秒之速度、獲得冠軍、按日本健將田中、靑地之能力、亦非必高於賈氏、賈氏第一次測騐造成八百公尺全國新紀錄、第二次造成四百公尺五十二秒四之優秀成績、</p>
<p>打破紀錄二　高欄黃英傑以十六秒打破全國紀錄、競賽時、黃與林紹州最為努力、跑過五個欄時、林尙在黃前約三公尺、但林中途退下、黃則始終努力、結果創造全國新紀錄、按黃於去年全國運動會中、兩造十六秒四、回粵後、苦練百公尺、此次北上參加訓練班、已有相當把握、高欄十六秒之紀錄、中國選手可稱第一、希望黃氏再加努力、</p>
<p>打破紀錄三　標槍彭永馨以五十一公尺五三創全國新紀錄、競賽時彭與健將周長星、程孟平週旋、周因左臂微痛、臨陣失去戰鬥力、終於退出戰團、彭投擲標槍甚努力、但投至五十一公尺五三時、足部僅離板寸許、其能打破全國紀錄、實山險境中取得、程孟平以四十六公尺三十居第二、</p>
<p>健將來去忙　東北中距離虎將王銘紳、素以保持全國八百公尺紀錄有名、現已携眷　平、仍繼續練習、大有重整旗鼓之勢、按王之八百公尺曾有二分以內之非正式成績、又上海全市春季運動會、將提前於十九日南返、</p>

<h3>汪錡</h3>
<p>— 蘇子涵</p>
<p>魯國同齊國雖然都是周朝開國時候的功臣的後人，但是她們兩國却時常打仗；齊國要大些，要强些，所以，齊國去打魯國的時候要多些。</p>
<p>魯哀公十一年春天，齊國的國君又呌大夫國書同高無丕兩個人，帶領人馬，去攻打魯國，不幾天，大兵就到了魯國邊境了。</p>
<p>那時魯國的政權已經落在大夫季孫叔孫孟孫三家手裏。這三個入裏面，季孫又頂專權不過，叔孫孟孫兩個人都不大高興他，他們在那裏爭權奪利，却把魯國弄得烏七八糟。</p>
<p>這决齊兵來了，季孫就同他的家臣，孔夫子的學生冉求商議。冉求主張季孫守城，叔孫同孟孫帶兵去抵敵齊兵。季孫知道叔孫孟孫同自己不合，决不會出去打仗的。冉求就說：「如果這樣，主公一個帶兵出去抵敵好了。主公是魯國當政的人，齊國來侵略，如果不出去抵敵，是魯國的羞恥，也是主公的羞恥。幷且魯國的兵馬百姓也不少，未見得就打不贏齊兵。除非他不是魯國人，他就不跟着出去打仗；只要是魯國人，都應該跟着出去的！」</p>
<p>大家商議一法子，商量好了：孟孫帶領魯國的中央軍做右軍，冉求帶領季孫的部下七千人，同武城的守軍三百人做左軍，出南門去抵敵齊兵。</p>
<p>那時魯國有個童子，名呌注錡，還在學堂裏讀書，聽見齊兵來攻打魯國，孟孫同冉求帶兵出城抵敵去了，當下就暗自想道：「齊國眞算是蠻橫無理極了，時常都到我們魯國來騷擾：現在又來了，我雖然年輕，但是也是魯國人，齊國欺侮魯國，我常常不是氣憤不過嗎？現在我們的兵將都出城去拚命去了，我幹嗎不去呢？學裏先生不是時常說，只要是魯國人，就應該衛護魯國的。我現在應該帮我們的兵將去打仗，只要殺死一個齊國人，也算替魯國報了仇，替魯國增了光，也不枉自我是一個魯國人！好，就這樣辦。」</p>
<p>在錡打定了主意，也不吿訴家裏的大人，就把長大衣服脫了，提着家裏製來防賊的銅頭長矛，悄悄悄的溜出來，到街上去了</p>
<p>汪錡到了街上，就去把他的同學們以及平常同他一道玩耍的小朋友們找到一塊，就開口說：「齊國欺負我們魯國也欺負得够了，現在又來欺負我們了，我們的兵將也出城抵敵去了。學裏先生不是常向我們說：只要是魯國人，就得衛護魯國。現在正是我們衛護魯國的時候了。諸位，有膽量的，就同我一道去殺齊國人罷！」</p>
<p>有人說：「打仗不是要死嗎？」</p>
<p>汪綺說：「只要能够替魯國增光，死算甚麼！」</p>
<p>有三四個人異口同聲說：「好！我有膽量，我不怕死，在哥，我同你一道去！可是，我們沒有兵器，怎辦？」</p>
<p>汪錡說：「這不要緊，你們家裏有的是刀矛，有的是木棍。就說沒有刀矛木棍，難道拳頭脚尖不能够用嗎？」</p>
<p>那三四個人說：「好的！我們回家去找。汪哥，你在這裏等一會兒吧。」</p>
<p>這三四個人跑了，那些膽小怕死的也漸走開了，只剩下在錡一個人站在那兒，看着通南門的那一條大街，聽着南門外的喊殺聲。</p>
<p>不多久，那些回去找兵器的三四個人都來了，汪綺就帶着這一羣小英雄，大踏步向南門去了。</p>
<p>他們剛走到南門城門口，就碰見在綺的鄰居公叔務人，公叔務人就問在錡拿着兵器到那裏去，汪錡說：「出城帮我們兵將殺齊國人去。」</p>
<p>公叔務人說：「我也是的。我們一道走吧。」</p>
<p>他們一道出城去了。</p>
<p>汪錡他們剛一出城門，就看見許多人扶老携幼，揹包　裏，慌慌張張的往城裏逃走，有的走不動的，就在路邊上歇氣，有的又在抱怨，有的又在哭。</p>
<p>公叔務人看見這樣情形，不覺長歎道：「當公事的事這樣多，苛捐雜稅又這樣重，把百姓都弄得走頭無路。現在齊國的兵又來了，如果當政的人能够上下齊心，去抵敵外國到也罷了；偏偏現在這些卿大夫只會爭權奪利，軍士們又不能死戰，這成甚麼話！你看這些逃難的人多慘！這全是他們幹的！」</p>
<p>汪錡說：「我們不要管別人，只管自己。我們這回出去拼命，總算是一個魯國人應該做的。像我們這樣的人魯國也許不少；我們一會兒瞧罷。」</p>
<p>公叔務人說：「那自然。我們笑別人不能够死戰，我們也不能死戰，豈不是笑話一塲。我們要替魯國增光，至死方休！」</p>
<p>他們邊說邊走，離戰塲已經不遠了。</p>
<p>話說魯國孟孫同冉求這兩支人馬，出了南門，到了郊外，在離稷曲不遠地方，就碰見了齊兵。在齊兵同魯兵的中間，隔着一條泗水，齊兵在泗水那面，魯兵却在泗水這面不過去。虧了冉求說了多少話去鼓勵，魯兵才過了泗水</p>
<p>兩陣對圓，冉求的左軍就殺進齊陣去了，孟孫的右軍剛同齊兵一打，就敗了下來，齊將陳瓘陳莊兩人，帶了一支人馬緊緊追趕，一直追過泗水。</p>
<p>汪錡他們走到戰塲的時侯，孟孫的右軍已經敗了下來，「孟」字旗號亂得不堪；但是左邊的「冉」字旗號却在齊陣裏攪着一團，殺得灰塵四起。</p>
<p>汪錡看見了，就說：那「冉」字旗號一定是冉求，他是好男子。我們讓過這邊，到那邊去殺齊國人罷！」</p>
<p>於是在錡他們讓過右邊孟孫的敗兵，趕到左邊去，一聲大喊，棍矛並舉，衝殺進去，同冉求會在一處。兩邊殺得天地變色，日月無光，一直殺到下午，才把齊兵殺退。</p>
<p>第二天，在戰塲上找到了汪錡他們的屍首，全是全身是傷，全身是血，但是仍然是生氣勃勃的。</p>
<p>魯國的人用成人的禮葬了汪綺。孔夫子知道了，說：「汪錡能够捨死忘生的替魯國打仗，替魯國爭光，雖然是童子，照成人禮葬他是對的。」</p>
<p>正是：汪錡雖年幼，丹心垂千古！</p>
<h3>培爾　Alexander　Graham　Bell（1847-1922）</h3>
<p>— 鐘寶</p>
<p>—電話發明家—</p>
<p>培爾於一八四七年三月三日，生於英國蘇格蘭的愛丁堡市。父親是一偭硏究音響學的學者，母親是非常喜歡音樂的人。培爾從小跟着他的父母學習，運用慣了他的聽覺，因此對於一切聲音都發生趣味。</p>
<p>培爾是一個很富同情心的孩子。有一天，他聽着母親奏琴，覺得非常快樂，但他忽然想到許多人沒有他這樣好福氣，决定下决母親奏琴，我聲個小朋友來聽。第二天早上，母親又在奏琴了，他來不及的人，忙到街上隨便拉人聽去，不想拉着隣街一個耳聾的女孩子。那孩子因爲有了這廢疾，常常受別的孩子欺負。她以爲培爾要來欺負他，忙擺脫了他的手跑去了。培爾捨不得，在後頭追趕着。他正追得起勁，猛不防從橫裏伸出一只大手來攔住了去路。培爾抬頭一看，不是別人，正是他父親攔住他問他忙什麼。培爾一面指着那女孩子，一面喘氣道：「我要請她聽母親奏琴去。」父親很嚴厲的喝止他道：「不要這樣！你怎麼無緣無故和人開起玩笑來了？雜道你不曉得她是聾子嗎？」培爾很驚奇的問道：「爲什麼不讓聾子聽琴呢？」父親才曉得兒子是不懂得聾子是不能聽的，於是改了溫和的辭色吿訴他道：「兒，不是我不讓聾子聽琴，實在是因爲聾子的耳朶有毛病，不能聽。她何止不能聽琴，什麼聲音也不聽得出來的。聾子因爲失了聽覺，也不能學話，所以一個早聾的聾子，同時也是一個不能說話的啞叭。」培爾聽　父親的話，心裏很難過，老是想道：「我怎能有法子使聾子能聽，啞叭能說呢？」以後培爾無論何時何地，看見有人欺負聾子，必定走上前來替他　忙，盡力愛護他們？好像全世界的聾子，都是他的好朋友似的。他的愛心一天一天的發展起來，很自然的變了一個仁義爲懷的君子了。這件事情對於他將來的發明事業，有很大帮助的。</p>
<p>培爾到了學年，父親便送他到學校念書去。那時他還很留意各種的聲音。他聽見什麼，都愛傾耳聽聽。住在培爾隣近，有一家人是以磨麵爲生的。培爾每天上學去，總是愛站着那家鬥首，聽一會水車推磨的聲音。這樣不覺過了好幾年了。有一個早上，培爾又按時經過那裏，竟然聽不見應聲。他很奇怪，把耳朶貼近門來聽裏面像有人哭着。他曉得一定有人受了委曲，他急於知道究竟，好設法解救人。他打了幾下門，沒有人理他，只得推門進來。他看見一個頭髪全白的老人伏在石磨上，嗚嗚咽咽的哭着。培爾於是脫了帽，走上前來很恭敬的說道：「老先生，請恕我未曾得到您的准許便跑進來看您，我是住在這裏不遠的一個少年，我有責任帮忙您一切，請吿訴我您的委屈！」</p>
<p>老人抬起頭夾，看見一個陌生的小孩站着他面前說這樣的話，覺得很滑稽，幾乎要破涕爲笑了。但他忽然受培爾摯誠的態度感激了，知道培爾的來意是眞的，忍不住感激得淌下淚來。他坦坦白白地對培爾說道：「小哥兒，我的事不是一個孩子可能帮忙的。但是你旣然願意知道，我可以吿訴你我的困難，你能吾帮忙，我是一樣感激你的。我今年巳經七十三歲了，只有一個二十三歲的小兒子，我們是靠着磨麵爲生的。兒子在家，一切工作都是兒子幹。不想最近兒子給國家微去當兵了。剩下我一個人在家磨麵過日。」老人一面說一而指着水車道：「有水，車好動，磨麵的事，我勉强還能幹得來。無如現在天早了許久，水少，移不動車。我眼見沒法磨麵，準要餓死的，思前想後，以後的日子眞不好過啊。」培爾安慰他道：「這好辦，我替您推磨就是了。」</p>
<p>培爾忙回到校裏，立刻找了一班小朋友，把這事吿訴他們，拿義氣激動他們，和他們約定每天來帮助老人推磨。小孩子以爲推磨也是一件好玩的事情，大家都答應了。果然第二天許多小朋友跑來帮忙。人多力大，沒有水，磨也能動了。過了些日子，小孩都覺得推磨的事情，單調無味。一個爲頭的推辭不來，大家都逃避一空了，最後只剩培爾一個人替老人推磨。培爾拚命的使勁，急到淚和汗都流個不止，也沒法把磨推得動。他很慚愧的辭了老人回家，悄悄地溜進父親的書房裏，苦思救濟的方法。過了一會，他自心裏猜想道：「磨要這樣費力才能推得動，一定是因爲牠的磨擦力太大。如我能設法把　擦力减少，應一定很容易推動的。」他廢寢忘餐，想了一個月功夫，才弄成功一個改良膚臼的圖案，使臼齒與白齒相接得吻合，减少摩擦，又利用圓形麥粒，互相挨　，减輕磨白廻旋之力。他拿着圖案去敎工匠改造新白，和改良舊臼。結果新磨很便利使用，可不用借助於水，只要一老人或一孩子的氣力，也能推動牠。從此不但是這老人的困難解救了，一付靠磨麵爲生的人，都受培爾的賜呢。</p>
<p>中學畢業後，培爾便進愛丁堡大學硏究音響學。後來又進倫敦大學研究，同時做他父親的助理。培爾禀着他小時愛護聾子的心，很注重聾子的敎育。二十一歲那年，他便到聾啞學校敎書去。他非常的努力硏究，盼望能發明一種工具，可以敎他的聾啞學生也能發音正確。不幸他正在埋頭硏究的時候，他兩個兄弟都因爲肺病在倫敦死了。父親怕培爾也會染着致命的肺病，馬上要他到坎拿大去。培爾在那裏因爲努力的結果，名噪一時，第二年波士頓大學便聘他做敎授。</p>
<p>兼時　報已　道行，但是　沒有電話。培爾以爲音波也可以借電綫傳達而成電話的。他因爲不懂得電學，不敢下結論，特地到華盛頓請敎一位有名的電學技師去。技師聽了培爾的話，很不客氣的笑道：「你相信音波可以靠電綫傳達，完全是因爲你不懂得電學。如果你稍微有一點電學常識，你就不會發這樣荒謬的議論了。」培爾不好意思，不敢多說，回家專心硏究電學去。研究了兩年，更加堅决了他的音波可由電綫傳達的信仰。他决定發明一個電話機，但他不懂得製造器械的技術，知道非找一個精於機械學的助手不可。他物色了好些日子，才找到瓦特孫（Thomas　A.Watson）。他們决定彼此用全力來發明電話，於是培爾辭去敎授之職，整日整夜和瓦特孫在研究室裏工作。他們硏究一有所得，常常幾天不睡覺，追求結果。這樣又過了兩年，電話機果然給他們發明了。培爾非常高興的把電話機專賣得來的錢都捐給整啞學校。此時培爾才二十九歲，馬特孫不過二十一歲。</p>
<p>第二年培爾娶一個聾女爲妻，夫婦倆笑容可掬地到英法度蜜月去。以後他一方面推廣電話的用途，一方面爲聾子和啞吧謀幸福。他賺得來的錢，往往不論多少，全部捐去帮助聾啞敎育。他一生盡力用科學方法來帮忙聾子啞吧也能有聽說話的本領，還使不聾不啞的人隔着幾千里路也能互相對話。</p>

<h3>如何養成學術風氣（下）</h3>
<p>— 周寒梅</p>
<p>小學生人事未通，姑不置論，一般大中學生應該有點覺悟而自奮了，然而不然。這我們與其說是大中學生不刻苦自勵，不如說社會環境和學校情形决定了他如此的。他們眼見社會上對於靑年的錄用並不着眼於眞才實學，而是八行書及學歷，那麼在校內讀書祗須分數及格文憑到手足矣，苦口硏讀，豈非獃子？致於將來有吾八行書到手，那是很渺茫的事了，何必管它；這是社會環境决定他不讀書的最大原因。同時現在的一般學校，不要說正心誠意於念書的學生有幾，就是正心誠意於辦學的究有幾何呢？不妨以上海而論，有多多少少的一商業敎育家」，藉辦敎育而歛錢，以學生爲商品，這種學校，這種敎育，還談得上學術空氣之淺薄與否嗎？致於公立學校之成績優良老，恐怕也鳳毛麟角吧！</p>
<p>一切都陷於畸形狀態中的中國，是非不分，功罪不明，賞罰不淸，學術空氣之日趨衰落，將來舉國滔滔者，盡屬不學無術吹牛拍馬之徒，也都在我們意料之中，而絕不足怪異者。所以我們要撥正這現象，旣非一朝一夕之功，但亦非雷厲風行的手腕，針對時弊的方案不可。現在試述作者對於養成全國學術風氣的辦法如决，以求賢明的讀者加以指正！</p>
<p>第一，全國勵行考試制　作者理想的終極目的，是各個職業羣中都實行考試制，不論求職或升降，都須以學識才能和工作成績爲絕對的準則。不過，這辦法並不能一蹴就幾，而應該逐步推進。第一步瞧從政府各機關施行起，所有各級公務人員，都應該經過嚴格而公正無私的考試，然後錄用或升降。如是，不獨行政效率可不推進而自推進，倖進奔競之風，亦可稍殺。政府機關推行有成效後，然後用政府的力量，施行於各個職業羣中各高級的職員。務須全國達到其「人盡其才」，「用其所學」的目的。那麼社會上的學術風氣可養成，而學校裏的學術空氣更可濃厚了。</p>
<p>第二，政府及社會，應積極獎勵學術。國家之治，由於是非明而賞罰公；社會之亂，繋於是非顚倒而賞罰不明。賢明之政府，在消極方面的工作固然不應予以鬆弛，在積極方面的獎　更應切實注意。須知德治與法治，相轉而相成，决不可偏廢。中國固窮，但是微薄的　　學術的費用在預算中總可列入千萬份中之一二；退一步說，偌大的一筆庚欵，總該做些獎勵學術的工作。然而我們祗聽到國家補助敎育的經費，祗是完成了幾所公立的美輪美奐的大中學校舍；庚欵的基金，好像暴發戶的子第們濫花浪用；我們何嘗聽到有積極的實在的獎勵學術上的條例或辦法呢？刻苦好學之士，埋頭工作之人，旣得不到生活上的保障，又得不到社會上的援助，更談不上政府的獎勵，風尙日墮，人性日惡，其來也有自矣！所以我認爲政府，與社會的獎獎學術之舉，實刻不容緩。</p>
<p>一個社會的組織是有它密切的聯環性的，正好像一隻鐘表內的機輪，一方面的努力往往事倍而功半，共同的恊力的前進始能事半而功倍。出版事業之所以衰落，我們與其歸罪於出版事業，從事者的不努力，不如說楚社會畸形狀態下的必然的反映！</p>
<h3>幾種週刊</h3>
<p>— 靈光</p>
<p>說到目前上海的出版界，那是不能不承認週刊的蓬勃；這現象，我們可以說跟讀者購買力的衰落，是不無微妙關係的。不錯，週刋是介於日報。半月刊。月刋之間的刋物，近年來由於國內所造成的局勢“，日報上種種滑稽而又不盡確的新聞，這使誰都感苦悶的；半月刋與月刋啦？那是盡多通篇大論，不是自己所專於硏究的，誰都感到頭痛吧。週刋正介於這兩者的中間，內容力趨於通俗化，一般性；此外對於時事作簡明的解釋，論文則短小精悍，其爲一般小市民所歡迎，自無疑義。</p>
<p>週刊之出現於出版界，那是遠在十餘年前「禮拜六」聞其端的，不過這個刋物，雖然到現在還是繼續出版，然鮮少有人注意，筆者在這裏也不願加以論列，聰敏的讀者自能判別它的是非的。不過週刋之能給出版界一個衝動，那是「生活週刋」之出現，編者鄒韜奮君好像一個興奮劑醫師那樣，拼命對於小市民打嗎啡針，因此能我着近七八萬讀者，現在且把上海新近出版的幾種週刋來談談吧：</p>
<p>申報週刋　這是隨申報所附送的週刋，它的前身是申報月刋，它的內容是於偏重時事系統解釋，和各地方民情風俗的介紹，也可可說在許多週刋當中比較地知識化一點。它是沒有麻醉性的評論，有的是警闢的「小言」。「時事一週」，把一週來的時事，做了一種分析工作，這自然較日報上的單是記載來得詳盡一點；雖然也有人說，唯其是申報週刋，因爲補日報之不足，所以才會有分析時事的文章，共實，因爲是週刋，很應該多登些時間性的東西，這種分析時事，我說倒是每一個週刋所應有的任務。此外，它們每期有國際，政治，經濟，以及小說，散文，隨筆之類的文章，雖在編輯上欠活潑了一點，但究不失爲一高級的讀物。</p>
<p>新人週刋「新人週刋」出版到現在，已經有二年光景吧，從第二卷起，是由周寒梅君所編輯，一週論壇裏的文章，那是很能引起讀者大衆的共鳴的。不過筆者引以爲憾的，那就是關於國際，政治，經濟方面文章的缺少，這是該刋應該加以注意的。近幾期來，對於日本方面的風俗，人物，政治等等，介紹殊多，這確能引起一般時下靑年所注意。此外，它們還有「國內外大小事」，「文化報道」，「人物評傳」，「生活實感」，「文藝創作」等，每期統有値得一讀的文章。最近每期銷行巳達三四萬之多，這的確是它的內容保證它的發展的。</p>
<p>末了，我覺得「新人」的書報應該力求時朋性一點，雖然這是一般刋物的通病，但我們不得不厚責於「新人」的主持者的。</p>
<p>中國學生　看到它的名字，我們就知道它的對象是學生方面。不錯，這確是一般學生所應該一讀的，它每期有「評論」，有「時事講活」，有關於學生方面的通訊，大事記，有「海外紀聞」與「文藝」等，不但內容可觀，就是文字也很充實的。在編排方面也很美觀，這是値得提出來的。在這裏，筆者特爲推荐於全中國學生前。</p>
<p>人言週刋　好像形式决定了內容似地。在現在還用老五號字排印，竟太笨重了一點。對於這木週刋，無論是內容以及形式，　　實在是不敢恭維，就是很漂亮的影寫版畫報，它的照片是失去了時間性的。</p>
<p>汗血週刋　這是一本印得很美觀的週刋，從書報以至於裏邊文字，無一不表示其富麗的樣子，不過遺憾的裏邊幾篇文字太欠高明了，這是應該請他門的主持人注意的。</p>
<p>永生　這是一本繼承「大眾生活」而來的週刋，這是誰都知道的，正因為「大眾生活」之被禁，所以「永生」的內容也略略改變了一點，然乃而大體上，還是一仍其舊。這裏應該提到的，就是時事圖表，那的確値得一讀的。最近又增加了分析事的「每週的中國和世界」，這也是很好的。</p>
<p>這裏總算把上海發行的幾種週刋，加了點簡單的批評，同時筆者還得聲明的，這裏所謂的批評，實際上不過是作者的印象而已，我唯有誠懇地禱祝全上海乃至全國所有週刋的編輯，竭力檢討自己的內容，充份地擔負起敎育大眾的使命來。</p>
<h3>我的讀書經過（上）</h3>
<p>— 獨秀</p>
<p>自己在社會上奮鬥，巳經有八個年頭了，在未入社會之前，正式受學校敎育也經過了小學中學大學三個階段：在求學時代固然讀書，在社會上服務也仍繼續讀書，讀了二十四年的書，現在回憶起來，眞够慚愧與懊喪的。</p>
<p>我想不僅是我一個人有這種慘痛的過去吧？恐怕有許多人都會和我一樣的悲哀的，雖然讀了二十多年的書，却像是在一片渺茫的沙漠中睹衝盲撞，在知識的烟海中簡直像是一隻失去了指南針的小舟，載浮載沉，所以航駛了二十多個年頭，旣談不到什麼目的地，更說不上什麽學術上的造就。在大中小學校的過程中，老師沒有讀書指導的敎訓；在社會上服務，更有許多惡的環境壞的刺戟誘離你的書本；現在來描述我的讀書經騐，眞不無感慨具痛心啊！</p>

<h3>治頑癬惡瘡之特效藥</h3>
<p>— （季常）</p>
<p>治療皮膚病之外用藥極多。而功效亦有優有劣。苟選擇不得其常。非但不能顯共效騐。有時且呈反對作用。譬如欲消炎而炎症反著。欲止癢而癢感愈劇。故藥劑之選擇。不可不注意也。夫治療皮膚病之外用藥物以具有深達作用而無害於人體爲原則。蓋皮膚之對於藥物。因共表皮角質層之保護作用。不使藥物透過。如藥料精良。配製適宜。則表皮細胞漸被浸潤。細胞間之連絡。於是疏鬆。而藥物之作用。可深達內部矣。上海法租界西新橋街德行里一號。同仁西藥社發行之『甘露』藥水。深達作用殊爲卓著。殺虫殺菌。解毒去腐。止癢消炎。以之治各種頑癬疥癩。瘡癤濕疹。腫毒濕氣等一切皮膚疾患。無不奏效如神。速於痊瘉者。且所採原料。均係上品。製造方法。盡合藥理。故色澤氣味。淸香可愛。允共特長云。（按『甘露』每瓶價一元。）</p>
<h3>論胃病</h3>
<p>— （振邦）</p>
<p>夫胃健而身强。胃病而體弱者。此自然之理。人所恒知者也。蓋胃爲水穀之海。消化之官。居腹腔膈下。上接食管。下速小腸。飲食入口。經食管達胃。則胃即起蠕動。分泌胃液。而消化之。成爲糜粥。流入小腸。腸粘膜選其滋養分而吸收。以運行於全身各器官組織之細胞。其無用之廢料。則輸入大腸而由肛門排出。故吾人有正規之食物。正規之消化。正規之吸收。正規之排泄。然後生命得賴以保持。身體可以强健也。若胃罹病。則消化，吸收，排泄諸機能。俱起障害。惡心，嘔吐。胃痛，飽滿。消化不良。吞酸，嘈雜。貧血，眩暈。腹脹便秘。是皆胃病之主徵及其續發之症候。如此而欲身强體壯。必不可得。是以養心莫善於寡慾。而益壽莫善乎健胃也。近者上海法租界西新橋街德行里一號。同仁西藥社。本共歷年硏究之經騐。精製一種『胃必靈』藥粉。專治胃病。予臨床上。用之屢奏特效。誠患胃病者之救星。養生家之常備聖品也。每盒售洋一元。</p>
<h3>容顏保護法</h3>
<p>— （謹身）</p>
<p>顏面爲人之表。由稚幼而壯老。隨年齒以變其丯采。雖曰天然的生理機能爲主宰。然亦未使不可由人工保護而得左右者。夫衣以護身。髮以護首。顏面則因五官之所在。不得不直露以利其所司。因此迎風曝日。旣受塵沙之侵。復多微菌之染。常有使面部皮膚受摧殘之機。故雀斑飯瘰面皰。患之者多且夥也。旣患之。則損容顏而增痛癢。此所以面部不得不加以適當之保護法。即每日晨夕。先用冷熟水洗擦面部。揩乾之後。用『面麗』勻敷之。有殺菌去垢。嫩膚美容之功。預防面部疾患於未然。速愈雀斑飯瘰面皰於已發。最簡捷易行。適當而又有效者也。</p>
<h3>戒煙後遺症</h3>
<p>— （愚園）</p>
<p>戒煙不難。難在後遺症之得以善爲處置耳。所謂後遺症者。在戒煙將終了。或已戒絕後。所發之病象是也。其間最多遭遇者。厥爲神經衰弱。其症象頗複雜。就中以遺精失眠。最足以引起戒煙者之驚　。是故戒煙期間。施戒者。不得不預先顧慮及之，　用峻烈收歛之劑以止遺。麻醉安神之品以催眠。果可獲效於一時。而日久連用。釀成慢性中毒。實爲醫者之咎。此所以正式醫家所不取。惟『喜汝康』丸之治神經衰弱症。功效特著。對於遺精失眠。其療治之能力。尤爲出於自然。合乎生理。連續服用。毫無釀成慣性之弊。在戒煙期間服之。有頭止後遺症發作之功。在戒煙後已發遺精失眠者服之。有確實療治之效。深望戒煙者注意之。</p>
<p>（編者按。『喜汝康』治神經衰弱。確有獨到之處。該藥由上海法大馬路西新橋街。德行里一號同仁西藥社總經售。每瓶價二元云。）</p>
<h3>治療白濁病的檢討</h3>
<p>— （人俊）</p>
<p>在一般的傳染病中。傳播的範圍最普遍淹纏的時期最長久。而治療上又最不易的。這要算白濁病了。因爲白濁病的難治。所以治療的方法也最多。換一句話。就是治療本病的藥物。也算得是最多了。各種各色的注射液。病者旣感到不便。那就不得不求諸內服藥了。但是此種內服藥。又何啻數百種。我人治療疾病的方法如何。第一先要視乎所採用的藥劑是否盡屬優良可靠。如能利用良藥。那麼欲求痊愈。就不成問題。目今市上所見到的內服藥。只有「哥那多登」丸。可稱有效。因爲該藥在體內分解散佈的力量旣大。而深入病灶粘膜的滲透力。尤其偉大。至於利尿殺菌。止痛消炎等功效。尤與他藥卓然不同。無論亞急性急性。或是頑固的慢性。都能收根治之功。（按『哥那多登』每盒售二元。上海法大馬路西新橋街。德行里一號。同仁西藥社經售）</p>
<h3>白帶內外兼治良劑</h3>
<p>— （軼羣）</p>
<p>『內服白帶丸』與『外用白帶藥』。爲上海法大馬路西新橋街德行里一號。同仁西藥社獨家經售之著名婦科良藥。專治婦女新久赤白帶症。功效特偉。即淋濁性白帶。尤著奇績。婦女患單純白帶。或淋濁性白帶而不治者。唯有服用此兩藥。無不有藥到病除之功。吾儕於臨症上。巳歷試不爽。內服者每服二丸。日三次。價每盒二元。外用者爲陰道坐藥。每晚用一片。價每盒亦二元。病而內外兼治之。則奏效之速。亦意中事也。用刊之以貢獻於婦女界患者。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>這樣懲戒就算了事麼？</h3>
<p>— 閑</p>
<p>近據電訊，浙省兩縣長受懲戒處分，其一，浙崇德縣縣長羅仲達，經監院提劾後，中懲會議决免職，並停止任用二年，其二，浙天台縣縣長張寶琛，亦經監委會提劾後，中懲會議决降二級改叙。這兩縣長也算倒霉，一個小小的功名，拋掉了不算，名譽上的犧牲，終究罄西江之水，莫能洗掉了。</p>
<p>試一檢討兩縣長免職與改叙的原因，一個罪狀，是得賄朋分，縱匪殃民，羈押無辜，受賄改判。其他一個罪狀，是縱匪燒殺，濫押濫罰。試問這樣的罪狀，僅僅以免職降叙了事，未免看官階太重，看民命太輕了。照這兩個罪狀看來，該兩縣長在其任內，入民之受其荼毒的，已是不可勝數，今輕輕以免職改叙了事，恐怕對於入民還不免有些遺憾吧。</p>
<p>自國民政府成立以來，卽厲行廉潔政治，然而到現在，這種貪汚之風，還是盛行者，懲戒官吏方法的不嚴厲，恐怕也是一原因罷？苟其一官在身，無論貪贓枉法，作奸犯科，倘不發覺，儘可恣意橫行，無所忌憚，萬一發覺，亦不過拋却一官，便算了事，沒有甚麼大了不得，如是做官吏太便宜，做百姓太苦惱。幷且一個是停止任用二年，二年之後，仍可任用，一個是降叙二級，仍可做一小官，萬一手叚高明，一轉瞬間，還可恢復舊秩，而該地人民所受的創痛，當永永遺留也。</p>
<p>再檢査其罪狀中，縱匪燒殺，濫押無辜，是何等殘酷的舉動，眞是罪大惡極，莫說親罹其禍者，原是不堪設想，卽使異地之人聞之，亦已心驚肉跳，怒髪衝冠。而其結果，不過如是如是，不免令人興歎。在封建時代，官官相護，原屬平凡，革命以還，此種弊政，剷除已久，然其一種遺傳性質，還未根除，所以病民殃民之毒，還時留於各地也。</p>
<p>前日行政院通令各機關，嚴査貪汚，並列舉十項，限期塡報，在廉潔政府之下，自應有此嚴厲之裁制，但是塡報結果，成績尙佳，這種情形，早可預料，蓋政治的設施，未成萬分周密時，其現狀固如斯也。惟欲眞正嚴査官吏之貪汚與否，决不能以一紙空文便算了事，非時時密派專員，赴各地秘密偵査其治蹟，和聽取當地人民一般的口碑，不足以得貪汚之眞相，若案經人民吿發，當局派員調査，在此時期，該縣長已得施其掩飾手段，而其眞相，已有所難明矣。</p>

<p>迎聖母恐怕祗有在余山才可看到，佘山是江南九峯之一，和松江祗有十二里之隔，山上有夫主敎會建築敎堂，經過了五十多年的經營，茂林修竹，景色已略有可觀。每年的五月，照例要來一决迎聖母，遠近的天主敎友，要是抽得出閒吧，都要到佘山去祈禱一决的。</p>
<p>不過迎聖母是在早上的，佘山又沒有旅館，而迎聖母的前夜，又有一回空前的熱鬧；所以你耍去看迎聖母吧，最好隔晚就僱了船去，那麼可以歇宿在船裏。要是離佘山近，那麼一大早走去或是搖船去，也還可以看見，但到了迎聖母的一天，要是天公作惡，下起雨來，那便要改期的。</p>
<p>自我們的家鄕走到余山，祇有七八里路，不消一個鐘頭就可到達，而且走還比船快得多。當我們到達佘山的時候，老遠已看見那綠樹靑竹之中，顯出了幾所白色的敎堂，人聲是那麼熟鬧，使你在遠處也可聽到。環山的那條小河之中，船停泊得把通路塞斷了，在整千萬的大小不一致的船隻之中，特別多的是米船和漁船，因爲販米和捕魚的人們之中，信天主敎的有不少呢！</p>
<p>在前山門口，這裏趕節的小販，搭起了布蓬，在出售食物和玩具這一類東西，人又那麼多，軋得要命，眞像戲塲上面一樣呢！天是快要暗下來了，走進山門，路是非常的寬闊，一叚沙泥路，中間有幾層石級，所以平坦得和平地一樣，非常好走。上面是被樹葉和竹葉遮得看不見天空，望不到日月，路的旁邊，每間十幾步掛着一盞紅綠燈，蠟燭也一齊點亮了。在走道之中，偶然還可看見有西洋人在燃放紅　色的外國烟火。</p>
<p>到了中山，這裏有一所敎堂，前面是一個曠塲，也紮滿了燈彩，堂裏坐滿了敎友，在喃喃誦經？四周是掛着繡花的旗旛。和敎堂相對的一面，齊巧在綠樹靑竹之中，裝有幾尊神像，敎友們大家跪在神像之前祈禱，而燈彩也紮得更多，這裏可算全山的精華，最熱鬧的地方了。</p>
<p>再打石級上走去，到了山頂，還有一所敎堂，而余山的天文台，也就在敎堂的後而。下山的時候，另一面還有通路，成了凹形，呌做經折路，每一個轉角，建有一所苦路亭，一共是十所，象徵耶穌十决蒙難，而最高的一處是十字架亭，敎友上山，每個人都要在每一苦路本前跪着誦經祈禱的。</p>
<p>約摸自八點鐘起，巾山的空塲上面，聖像之前，已是燈火齊明，看熱鬧的人這時都會集在那邊，軍樂隊，淸音班，中樂西樂，一邊開頭，一邊停止，接連着合奏起來？還有某一個敎會學校的童子軍表演。深山幽谷之間，來一决這樣的狂歡，也是別有的情調。不過這晚上女人是不准上山的，據說以前女人也好看的，爲了某一年出了事情，幾個女人被歹人調笑引誘，所以而今已不准女人在迎聖母的前夜上山看熱鬧了。</p>
<p>熱鬧過後，人是一齊下了山，橫豎那晚到陳坊橋去的人多！我們軋在人叢之中，披星戴月，經過了兩里路的夜行，才到了陳坊橋的鎭上。這晚上，在那鎭上是特別的多，茶館裏每家客滿，打牌的聲音，充溢於耳際，結果我們找到了朋友，就借宿在一家洋貨店裏，但他們沒有餘舖，祗借到了兩條被頭，就在櫃台上歇了一宿。</p>
<p>第二天起來，路上已透濕了，昨晚顯然又下過陣雨，幸而現在已放晴了。吃了一些早點心，馬上走到余山去，因爲八點鐘就要開始迎聖母的。雨後的泥路，爛得怪難走，一滑就要跌交，到了佘山，人像潮水般的擁上山去，現在女人也可以上山了，並不禁止。</p>
<p>這時候山巓上的砲聲，鐘聲，已在接連的在發出來，就是遠處的人家，也可隱約的聽見。聖母是在中山的，迎到山頂上的堂裏去，我們就在中山和上山的過路之中，人堆裏面，揀到一處地方立着看，走道之中，人正在不停的上山或下山。</p>
<p>迎聖母是開始了，在人聲擾雜之中</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>，突然看見中山的道子是上來了，旗傘前導，軍樂隊，淸音班，都很嚴肅的在慢步上山，麥着中西樂曲，而最後便是聖母的神像，有八個穿着白衣服的神父抬着走上山去。迎聖母的熱鬧就是這樣的一慕，和賽會文有什麼不同呢？</p>
<p>聖母迎到上山之後，什麽事情都過去了，人立刻又像潮水般得擁下山去，有船得各自回到船裏，沒有船得走回家去。這天德晚上，你要是再到佘山一看，那前山門已緊閉，攤子全部都收掉，而河裏的船隻，也大半開走了。待等明年五月，再來一决同樣的熱鬧。</p>
<h3>山</h3>
<p>— 丁厂</p>
<p>——紀念我底父親——</p>
<p>在外邊整整度過了四年的流浪生涯，我簡直有如大海里一個被颶風激揚的浪花，翻轉着，撕掙着，在向着不知去向的遠方奔流了。</p>
<p>日子在我的沉鬱的夢想裏轉動着。</p>
<p>偶然，我漫步於靜夜的街道上，用着疲憊的脚步去測度着黑暗中的艱險；或者趁四週都沉於死寂的無聲中，我從床上爬起來，在黯色的狹小的屋子裏徘徊着，輕輕地推開了窗，我向遠處望，呵，一片灰濛的夜，閃着光明的火點。星星脥着眼，流雲就是我的旅人的踪跡呵——　凄　的酸味，凟　在我底心上。於是，我悒鬱地患起了遼遠的懷鄕病來了。</p>
<h3>流動的家</h3>
<p>— 陳浩雄作</p>
<p>人間再沒有比我的家庭是孤苦的了。</p>
<p>我，遠遠地在這異地的驛站上，對於那掙扎在災患的壓榨下，和着飢餓的羈困中的母親，弟弟，我只有以懷念的心情寂寞地思戀着。除此而外，我有什麼力量補償他們曾經對我幻起的美滿之夢的熱望！我不曾有過一决勇氣給他們去封信，詢問他們的生活已經被迫而臨到那一步？這正像我自己不曾有過一次勇氣來問自己的生活明天會臨到那一步一樣。</p>
<p>是在我底記憶裏永遠不會忘却的一個秋天的深夜，我們全家人在××兵攻城的槍聲中而逃散了。茫然地奔走着，在豐盛的長滿着高粱的野地裏，在繁密的伸罩着樹葉子的森林裏，一些聲音，混雜着一些泣哭而開始了。</p>
<p>母親和弟弟不知逃到那裏去了。我扶着父親的賂膊，踉蹌地在一個深的山谷裏攢動着。夜氣已經有些寒冷了。當父親疲累得不能再舉步往前走時，總算爬出了山谷，然而依然是一片墨黑的很高很高的山。父親絕望似地，悲哀地說：「不必爬吧，爬到天亮也是山……就在這過個宿吧……」</p>
<p>這樣，我們便摸索到一塊舖滿着落葉的地方，就蓆地躺着而做着恐怖的夢。我時而望望樹林，時而聽聽遠處；槍聲，砲聽，人聲，震碎了我的心了！我心裏想：城市是燬滅了！父親似乎安靜地睡去，但突然，他顫抖一下，就爬起來，愁傷地喃喃說：「你母親和你弟弟，他們，他們，唉……」</p>
<p>天亮了。</p>
<p>灰暗的天空落着細雨。秋山的落葉一片黃色。峯巒起伏的山嶺，遮蔽着我們的視綫。我們望不見一個小村落四週是充滿着荒凉。我們又向另一個由動着脚步。父親走不幾步，便歪着頭和我說：「我怕是受凉了，腦袋又暈迷又痛。胸部也一跳一跳地痛呀！」</p>
<p>「快找一個人家好好睡一回。」我安慰他說」。</p>
<p>在另一個山上，母親和弟弟，還有幾個鄰人和我們遇上了。</p>
<p>半月的山中逃難的生活結束後，我們便回到城裏去。我們的一切都被燒燬</p>
<p>父親病了</p>
<p>不久，我也從家裏走出了。</p>
<p>一年以後的秋天，我居然回了一决家。</p>
<p>母親哭着向我嚕囌：「你，你在外邊住了一年了你就不來個信。你父親的病也很重，他想你要命，白黑痴說痴道，總是說：要兒子幹什麼，有病也不回來看看……」抹着淚，抽抽摘摘地又：「你倒底在外邊幹些什麼？錢也不往家寄個來，家裏的外債一個也沒還人家，你，你，你這次可帶回……」</p>
<p>我臉上立刻流滿了汗珠。我眼睛罩上一層灰影。我沉痛的始終沒有回答母親一個字。</p>
<p>家沒有方法挽留我這一個大野裏的跋踄人。一個月的出幽禁似的枯燥的家庭生活，已經把我底心折磨得冷然了。於是，我悄悄地踏上旅程。</p>
<p>誰知，當我離開家不久，我底父親便死了。</p>
<p>而今，當我憶起那曾被我底父親在逃難中所踏過的故鄕的山，這時該已經滿處是蘊藏着爆炸的火花吧？</p>
<h3>遲暮</h3>
<p>— 燕汀</p>
<p>遲暮。</p>
<p>暮靄已罩了遼遠的羣山，虹彩抹着半個天空。</p>
<p>在這時，那通連到維克普村道上，一個遼闊而靜寂的村道上，有一個人，用他疲憊的困乏的步伐在走着。他是一個的將五十年紀，穿着一身髒汚的舊水手服裝，鬚髮盡白的老人。他底面孔很端莊而愁悶。除了在他底背上，馱着的那個白帆布布袋和手中的木杖外，他是什麼也沒有携帶的。他是從維克普來的</p>
<p>當他停止在村子外一家小香烟店休息，而且拋給那店裏一個肥胖的小婦人一個値十仙銀幣要一包香烟時，他便用嘆息的聲調介紹着自己道：</p>
<p>「唉老媽媽，進林薩克村去，我想該不遠了吧？（其實村子就在他面前）」香烟店的小婦人，用吃驚的眼睛向他看着。「我是一個老水手，巳經十五年沒有回家了！……」小婦人默默的點着頭。他沒有在那兒停滯了好久，便去馱着帆布袋向村裏前進。</p>
<p>這村子，在十五年前是他底家，一個出色的漁村，背靠了山，而面却朝着那面浩茫的大海。那時，他還是一個强壯的中年人，爲着漁汛期近，他必須隨着他底瑪麗皇后號出發，在他和他底美麗的，年輕的妻和十歲的女兒擁抱中，海用粗亢的，莊嚴的聲音抱他們分開，使他們之間永遠有了一條水的隔離。因了在中途遇了可怕的風浪，三十幾個精練的水手，居然駕御不住　匹咆吼的巨獸，使得它毫無畏忌地隨着海底浪潮，望若遼闊的，無垠的海之邊沿奔潰。末了，他們是在一個陌生的，異鄕人底地域上被發現；而且爲着生活，他們不得不放棄了航海，而去替人家做點粗工度活，現在，他回來了，海和他隔絕了十五年，故鄕和他也隔絕了十五年。然而，他並沒有忘記自己是一個善良的水手，他穿着水手的衣服（雖然它是那麼地破舊而且　汚）：他沒有忘記了故鄕和家：他回來了。他現在是現得那麼地蒼老，而他相信這個曾熟稔地撫模過他，使他長大起來的村子，也變得比從前蒼老了。他想：麗絲一定也變得老了，而綠黛却不知長怎樣了。也許她已經是</p>

<p>Course of Changes in Illness in Recent Days</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Mr. Hu Hanmin suddenly fainted at 8:00 PM on the 9th at Chen Rong's residence in Yongyuan. Doctors Yang Zixiang and Chen Yiping were immediately summoned for diagnosis and treatment. At that time, the blood pressure was checked: systolic blood pressure was 210 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure was 135 mmHg, and there was left-sided hemiplegia. It was diagnosed as right-sided cerebral hemorrhage. Ice packs were immediately applied to the head and hot compresses to the lower limbs. At about 10:00 PM, he slightly regained consciousness. Mr. Hu seemed to know that he would not recover, so he immediately ordered the summoning of Xiao Focheng, Chen Jitang, Zou Lu, Lin Yunhai, Yang Xiji, Chen Yaohuan, Zhang Renmin, his wife Chen Shuzi, and his daughter Mulan, etc., to his bedside to dictate his will, which was recorded by Xiao Focheng. At this time, his consciousness was restless and indescribable. He frequently scratched his head with his right hand, as if he wanted to get up, and asked people to help him home. Doctors Yang and Chen wanted to calm him down and administered a small dose of sleeping pills, but he vomited and could not swallow them, so they switched to injection therapy, which slightly calmed him down. On the morning of the 10th, he fell into a coma, so they added doctors Bernot and Wang Xizhang for joint diagnosis and treatment. All agreed that his heart was weak, so they decided to inject cardiac stimulants. There was no major change that day. By the afternoon of the 11th, his condition gradually worsened, his pulse was intermittent, his systolic blood pressure was 150 mmHg, his temperature increased to 40.02 degrees Celsius, his pulse reached 275 beats per minute, and his respiration was 42 breaths per minute.

<p>Soliciting Opinions on Posthumous Ceremonies</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke telegraphed Xiao Focheng, Zou Haibin, Chen Bonan, Li Delin, Lin Yunhai, and other comrades of the Southwest Political Affairs Council on the 13th, stating, "Having received the telegram and learned of Mr. Hu's death, the fall of a mountain and the collapse of a tree causes sorrow throughout the world. Mr. Hu assisted Premier Sun in the revolution for decades, his name will go down in history, and his merits are for the nation. It was decided that after returning from overseas, he would recuperate and recover, and lead the people of the country to overcome difficulties. How could he have passed away so suddenly? The loss to the Party and the nation is indescribable. Regarding the posthumous ceremonies and national funeral matters, the central government is planning to proceed. Please provide details on how to handle matters in Guangdong, so that I can submit them for a decision." (12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A reporter recently visited Sun Ke to ask about his feelings on the death of Mr. Hu. When he arrived at Sun's residence, Sun, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Gongbo, Ce, and others were talking about the death of Mr. Hu. He then came out to meet the reporter. After explaining the purpose of his visit, he remained silent for a long time, looking extremely solemn, as if he had boundless sorrow. Then he slightly opened his lips and said to the reporter in a sorrowful tone, "Mr. Hu's death is indeed a major loss to the Party and the nation. I recall that recently, a friend came from the South and said that Mr. Hu did not mean not to come to Nanjing, but only said that the trip might be slightly delayed due to health and climate reasons. I never expected that he would pass away." At this point, his words gradually became inaudible, and tears were about to well up in his eyes. Fearing that he would be overwhelmed with grief, the reporter asked about the issues such as Mr. Hu's posthumous ceremonies. He replied that Mr. Hu's contributions to the Party and the nation deserved a national funeral. He said that he had to discuss with Mr. Chu Cang before deciding whether he should go south to mourn and assist in the funeral arrangements. He said that Mr. Hu was the first President of the Legislative Yuan, and in order to commemorate his pioneering efforts, the Legislative Yuan decided to suspend the regular meeting on the 15th to express its condolences. At this point, the reporter, fearing that he would interfere with Mr. Sun's important business, said goodbye. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chen Juesheng Discusses the Hebei-Chahar Diplomatic Incident; The Chahar North Issue Is Difficult to Resolve Temporarily; The Beining Railway Bureau Adopts a Three-Line Approach</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Chen Juesheng stated that the Hebei-Chahar diplomatic negotiations are being continued by the Hebei-Chahar diplomatic authorities. The cancellation of the Hebei-Shandong organization is only a matter of time for resolution, as there are still other issues to be discussed. The Chahar North issue is difficult to resolve temporarily due to the unique situation. The issue of building the Cangzhou-Shijiazhuang railway is currently under careful study by the Construction and Economic Committees, and progress can only be made after specific plans are obtained. The Beining Railway Bureau previously planned to adopt a three-line approach: one southern line from Cangxian to Shijiazhuang, one central line from Dagu to Shijiazhuang, and one northern line from Tianjin to Shijiazhuang. This plan is also being discussed in conjunction with the case.

<h3>British House of Commons Schedules Consideration of Smuggling in North China</h3>
<p>(London) The China Committee of the House of Commons is scheduled to meet on May 19 to consider the issue of smuggling in North China, with the aim of urging the government to make serious representations to the Japanese government and obtain their assistance in curbing smuggling. The committee will have several experts as assistants. The Times today published a detailed report on the smuggling situation in North China in a prominent position, and listed the adverse effects it has on customs loans and legitimate business. The newspaper also criticized the fact that the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin do not allow customs patrol boats to enter within three miles of Tianjin to pursue smuggling vessels. The report stated that due to the Tanggu Truce Agreement, Chinese police are responsible for maintaining law and order in the non-armed zone. The general opinion is that the Japanese military authorities are now using smuggling to pressure the Chinese government in order to obtain the concessions they desire. As for the dangers of anything that would undermine the integrity of the Chinese customs, the Japanese government is of course aware of them. (13th day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The House of Commons also discussed the China issue today. Conservative MP Maugham asked if the British government had received any reports regarding Japan's request for the North China Customs to be completely detached from the jurisdiction of the Nanjing government, with Chinese tariffs as collateral for British loans. Prime Minister Baldwin replied that he was aware of these rumors, but Foreign Secretary Eden had not received any reports confirming this statement. The Japanese Foreign Minister recently made a statement to the British Ambassador to Japan that Japan does not support the promulgation of a special tariff by any local authority within China. The British government is of course very concerned about maintaining the integrity of Chinese customs administration. (13th day Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) According to the Tianjin General Merchandise and Sugar Guild, the total value of general merchandise and sugar smuggled into the country each month since January of this year is approximately 1.5 million. The sales of domestic red and white sugar have been completely cut off. Even the sales in the six provinces of Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Suiyuan, Chahar, and Gansu, which used to rely on the Tianjin port for transit, have now been seized by smuggled goods. Merchants are suffering losses and are on the verge of collapse. If no urgent measures are taken, there will be significant changes in North China's commerce. (13th day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Due to rampant smuggling affecting domestic sugar sales and legitimate commerce, the Tianjin Sugar Industry Association petitioned the Customs Administration on the 13th, requesting the Tianjin and Donghai customs to find ways to crack down on smuggling and prevent smuggled goods from flooding in, forcing honest merchants to resort to smuggling for business. A petition was submitted to the Tianjin Customs, requesting that domestic sugar imports be allowed an extension for customs declaration and tax payment to avoid missing opportunities and allowing smuggled goods to sell freely. (13th day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Xi Dingmo, the superintendent of the Qinhuangdao Customs, came to Tianjin on the 13th at the invitation of Xiao Xichao to discuss anti-smuggling matters. Xi stated that the Qinhuangdao Customs has lost over ten million in customs duties due to smuggling since August of last year. The original armed anti-smuggling team of sixty members had their weapons confiscated due to restrictions in the Tanggu Truce Agreement, designating eastern Hebei as a non-armed zone, and interference from a certain party. As a result, the anti-smuggling personnel are all unarmed, leading to rampant smuggling. (13th day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to Tianjin Customs, the Tianjin Customs trade survey for March showed imports of 2,261,500 gold units and exports of 5,168,970 gold units. Compared to the same period last year, imports decreased by 2,657,000 gold units and exports increased by 2,472,000 gold units. On average, there was a 40% decrease, mainly due to smuggling and tax evasion, making it difficult to maintain customs revenue. (13th day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Merchants who recently purchased large quantities of rayon and sugar from smugglers are facing the risk of price drops due to the market being flooded with smuggled goods after the lifting of the Dagu port restrictions. The price of sugar has fallen sharply in the past three days, affecting small merchants as well. As a result, merchants are warning each other not to purchase rayon and sugar anymore. Merchants are also afraid that import taxes on these two items will be reduced, so they dare not buy more. Due to the sluggish sales of rayon and sugar, smugglers are now engaged in transporting other goods. In April, a total of 268 packages of smuggled rayon and 2,790 packages of sugar entered Tianjin. The East Station freight yard is full of these smuggled goods, with many having been piled up for weeks. It is reported that there are also twenty boxes of pistols smuggled in with general merchandise. The East Station freight yard is occupied by smugglers, leaving legitimate merchants with no place to store their goods, causing them to complain endlessly. (13th day Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>In Memory of Mr. Hu Zhantang</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>The sudden passing of Mr. Hu Zhantang, Chairman of the Central Supervisory Committee, in Guangzhou the night before last due to a cerebral hemorrhage has sent shockwaves throughout the country. Mr. Hu, with a body weakened by years of toil, suffered from high blood pressure and followed medical advice to travel abroad for a short period. Last winter, urged by the Central Government, he promptly returned home. His physical condition was unstable, and he stayed in Guangzhou for a short period, stating that with careful recuperation, he could gradually recover. Who would have thought that a sudden shock would bring news of the fall of a great pillar? The national crisis has not yet been resolved, and a virtuous person has passed away first. It is not just a source of sorrow within the party; all Chinese people should feel deep regret.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu was a pioneer of the Party and the nation, bearing the hope of saving the times. In his early years, he followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen, driving the revolution, starting with literary advocacy and then participating in practical work. His assistance and support in the strategic planning were repeatedly meritorious. When he assumed important responsibilities, he became even more dedicated and self-disciplined. His past achievements are clearly visible to all, and his unwavering integrity and consistent principles are sufficient to serve as a model for future generations, refining customs and inspiring integrity. As for his strict self-discipline and frugality, things that ordinary people find difficult to achieve were secondary matters for Mr. Hu. Today, central authorities such as Chairman Lin and President Chiang are preparing to save the country by promoting integrity and clarifying righteousness. After Mr. Hu entered Beijing, he would have been able to take the lead in promoting and encouraging each other, increasing the strength of advocacy, hoping to rally the country to follow suit. It is a pity that this plan has become a futile wish.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu devoted his life to the Party, so he was particularly concerned about Party affairs. Even while abroad, he was always preoccupied with them. At the beginning of his return to China this spring, he issued a written statement saying, "The Party should restore itself to a party with principles and spirit, and strive to eliminate the errors of dismemberment and disorganization in the past." Later, during his interactions with various sectors in Guangzhou, he repeatedly spoke about rectifying Party affairs. One statement was, "To save the country, we must first save the Party. Party members must all go deep into the people and uphold the principle of saving the country." Another statement was, "The only important thing for party members is sacrifice and duty." A third statement was, "Party members' responsibilities must not be evaded." His sincere concern was evident in his words. Mr. Hu believed that unity was even more necessary due to the numerous border troubles. Even in his overseas convalescence, he wanted to return promptly to participate in major planning. Unfortunately, he passed away before he could fulfill his aspirations. How disappointed must the central government officials who were looking forward to his cooperation be?</p>
<p>In short, although Mr. Hu has passed away, his spirit cannot be erased. Those who admire Mr. Hu can truly understand his legacy, promote unity within the Party, and also know to make sacrifices as a prerequisite to correct past mistakes. Then, even if Mr. Hu did not live to see the improvement of the atmosphere, he should close his eyes and smile in the afterlife.</p>

<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Budget Subcommittee: Nagano Announces Expansion of Navy; Air Force Armaments Also to Be Enhanced; But No Need to Establish an Aviation Ministry</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) At today's sixth subcommittee of the House of Representatives on the budget, after Seiyukai member Nagata Ryokichi questioned Minister of Communications Raemugi regarding civil aviation and international scheduled air service policies, he strongly advocated the unification of national aviation policies and believed it necessary to establish an aviation ministry. Minister Raemugi replied that there were no clear opinions on the establishment of an aviation ministry. Since civil aviation is already under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications, it will naturally strive to assist and develop it in the best possible manner. (Thirteenth Day Allied Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The fourth subcommittee of the House of Representatives on the budget (matters under the jurisdiction of the Army and Navy) convened on the afternoon of the 13th. Members Shimizu Ryuzaburo, Hachisuka Saburo, Matsuki Tadao, and others raised questions such as: What is the determination regarding the naval arms race in an era without treaties? Is there an intention to reduce the unit price of manufacturing warships and aircraft? What are Japan's countermeasures in a state without treaties?</p>
<p>Navy Minister Nagano expressed his significant determination in response to the above questions. The main points of his response are recorded below: The strength of the Imperial Japanese Navy has entered an era without treaties. If there is no maintenance and enhancement, by the end of 1941, its ratio to the United States will often become a disadvantageous 58%. From next year onwards, due to the absence of treaties, the naval armaments of the great powers will undergo epoch-making changes. This is inevitable. In order to cope with this international situation, the Japanese Navy must quickly establish a new enhancement plan. The enhancement of air force armaments is also necessary. Although the specific plan is still being fully formulated, it is not appropriate to explain it at this time. As for private military suppliers, strict control will be exercised, so there will be no profiteering. Efforts will be made to reduce the unit price of custom-made items. The total amount of military equipment purchased by the Navy from foreign countries is only 22 million yen, accounting for only 5% of the total. The main item is oil, while the remaining 95% is purchased domestically. The Navy's regular expenses will also need to expand in the future, and expenses such as the purchase of land and sea maintenance military supplies should also increase temporarily. These are all things we should be aware of. (Twelfth Day Allied Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The plenary session of the House of Representatives on the budget on the 12th continued at 7:10 p.m. Seiyukai member Fukazawa Toyotaro asked, based on the events of the February 26 Incident, whether it was suspected that former Prime Minister Okada had exhausted his loyalty to the Emperor, whether the survival of former Prime Minister Okada had been reported to the Emperor, and what the situation was. He also asked how many irresponsible points the cabinet members at that time had. Prime Minister Hirota replied that, in his consideration, the fact that former Prime Minister Okada was alive seemed to have reached the Emperor's ears.</p>
<p>Fukazawa then used fierce language to urge Minister of Education Hirao to abandon the theory of abolishing Chinese characters. However, Minister of Education Hirao stubbornly insisted on the theory of abolishing Chinese characters. Miyoshi Eikichi, Takahashi Kumakichi, Matsuda Kisaburo, Hanna Kanwa, Nakamura Kaju, and Nakamura Sanzojo each answered questions regarding local problems, financial problems, etc., with the relevant ministers. Nagata Ryosaburo strongly advocated that the establishment of a private Sino-Japanese international air service is an urgent task at present.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hirota and Foreign Minister Arita jointly replied that this matter had almost been resolved, but due to certain reasons on the Chinese side, it was temporarily suspended, and they intended to make efforts.</p>
<p>Finally, Kobayashi Ki also raised the issue of human rights violations, and thus all questions were completed. The meeting adjourned at 10:30 p.m. The budget plenary session lasted for four days, and a total of forty-seven questioners participated. Chairman Kawasaki expressed his gratitude to the members for their efforts in his closing remarks. (Thirteenth Day Allied Telegram)</p>

However, various factions also intend to hold meetings to discuss whether to allow Kato to question this issue. If his questioning is permitted, a closed-door meeting will be necessary.

<h3>London Times Comments on Japanese Army Minister's Remarks, Worries About the Future of the Pacific</h3>
<p>(London) Today's editorial in The Times criticized the Japanese Army Minister Terauchi's statement that a Soviet proposal to conclude a non-aggression treaty was of little value, and that the Soviet Union has 50 submarines and a squadron of aircraft that can attack Japanese cities from Vladivostok. The editorial stated that if Terauchi's words reflect Japan's future policy, then the future of the Pacific is indeed bleak. Since Japan considers non-aggression treaties to be useless, it will inevitably engage in an arms race with the Soviet Union. In this competition, the Soviet Union has various advantages. Japan cannot consolidate its military position on the Asian continent except through aggression. The only location for large-scale war preparations is in Russia. The improvement of the Siberian Railway is a very important factor in the current situation, and the Soviet Air Force is of crucial importance. The number and range of Soviet bombers will increase with time until the concerns currently raised by Japan become more acute. (Thirteenth Day Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Rice Cake Contains Deadly Poison; Thousands of Students Poisoned; Thirty-Eight Have Died</h3>
<p>Hamamatsu: Yesterday, on the 10th, Hamamatsu First Middle School held its annual sports day. It ordered more than 6,000 daifuku mochi (rice cakes) from a confectionery shop in the city to share with more than 1,000 students and all the school staff. Unexpectedly, more than 1,200 people were poisoned after eating them, causing great panic. As of 10:00 a.m. on the 13th, 38 people had been found dead from poisoning. A technical team from the Ministry of Home Affairs' Sanitation Bureau and a medical team from the Hamamatsu Garrison Hospital are currently investigating the cause and working hard to provide relief. However, the authorities are still avoiding publishing the contents of their investigation, as the rice cakes seem to have been mixed with a deadly poison. The Governor of Shizuoka Prefecture attaches great importance to this situation and immediately went to Tokyo to consult with the Ministry of Home Affairs on how to deal with the aftermath.

<h3>Itagaki Leaves Tokyo to Return to His Post, Says Kwantung Army Expansion Will Be Implemented Starting Next Year</h3>
<p>(Yokohama) Lieutenant General Itagaki, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, came to Japan to discuss policies towards Manchuria with the central authorities of the Army. Regarding the issue of strengthening the Kwantung Army, he reached a consensus with the central authorities and decided to implement it with the budget after the Showa 12th year. Itagaki completed his official duties and left Tokyo at 9:30 p.m. on the 12th with Staff Officers Hanatani and Chida to return to his post. Itagaki gave a speech in the train, saying: "Enhancing the Kwantung Army's military equipment is a problem that we have already determined. Now that the Kwantung Army and the central army have completely consistent specific opinions, it will naturally be realized from next year onwards. Therefore, the Army's budget will have to increase by a large amount in these years. When I stayed in Tokyo, various parties questioned the border issue. However, the border issue and the Japanese-Soviet war are different issues. If Japan and the Soviet Union go to war, there must be other reasons. However, there is no such problem now. The eastern border issue will be resolved through diplomatic negotiations. However, it is still doubtful whether the Soviet Union will conduct negotiations with sincerity in the future. The Outer Mongolia side has maintained a calm state after being struck once. The Manchuria Conference cannot be reopened unless the other party eliminates the reasons for the split and comes forward with sincerity. As for the immigration issue, the cabinet should decide as soon as possible on a policy to transfer a large number of immigrants to 'Manchukuo.' However, this requires funding. Some immigrants can be realized from the 12th year onwards. However, the government should decide on a national policy to realize a large-scale immigration policy in ten years. The immigration plan of 500,000 people in twenty years is a reference case and not a decision." (Thirteenth Day Allied Telegram)</p>
<h3>In the Border Area of Pseudo Yangyuan County, Guerrilla Forces Attack Japanese Troops, Killing Three Japanese Officers and Seizing Countless Weapons</h3>
<p>(Changchun) Six white bandits from the guerrilla forces of Zhao Shangzhi recently attacked Tangyuan County in Pseudo Sanjiang Province and fought fiercely with the Japanese Qinggu Detachment for six hours. As a result, three Japanese officers, including Qinggu, were killed, and dozens of boxes of military equipment and ammunition were seized. Because the peasants in Pseudo Manchuria cannot bear the exorbitant taxes and levies, whenever guerrilla forces arrive, they are happy to act as guides, pointing out the situation of the Japanese troops stationed there. Moreover, there are also strong men who temporarily join the battle, so the guerrilla forces are invincible wherever they go. (Thirteenth Day China United Telegram)</p>

<h3>Japan Decides to Establish Dedicated Police to Suppress Fascist Groups</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to suppress the activities of fascist groups, the Japanese government has decided to increase the number of police officers dedicated to this task by 567, and allocate them to the Special Higher Police Sections of various prefectures. The expenses have also been set at 450,000 yen. Previously, the Japanese political police had completely focused their attention on suppressing the activities of Communist Party members, and had tacitly condoned fascist groups. Because these people had no fear, they acted recklessly and presumptuously, creating the unprecedented February 26 Incident. The government then decided to limit their scope of activities. There are more than 600 fascist organizations in Japan, with a total of more than 200,000 members. (Thirteenth Day China United Telegram)</p>

He said that if it were not so, he would not forgive the violation of international duties. The Emperor also said that the reason why he and the royal family left the country was to end the slaughter of the people and the unnecessary destruction of property. Future plans have not yet been decided, but he does not want to announce them before they are implemented.

<h3>Italy's Policy of Annexing Albania: Albanian Representative Issues Weak Appeal, Urging All Countries to Take Effective Measures; Survival of the League of Nations Depends on This One Move</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Albanian representative to the League of Nations, Marian, made a statement to reporters last night when he left here for Paris, claiming that he hoped the League of Nations could take strong measures to prevent Italy's annexation of Albania, because the un-conquered area of Albania still accounts for half of the country, and this half is also the richest area in the country. Attempts should be made to make it independent. (Thirteenth Day National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council held a public meeting this afternoon. After the Albanian representative made a passionate appeal, it passed a resolution to postpone discussion of the Italian-Albanian dispute until June 15, in order to maintain sanctions against Italy and request that sanctions not be relaxed during this period. The Chilean representative did not vote on this resolution, while the representatives of Ecuador and Argentina attached reservations. The Italian representative, Aloisi, returned to his country with the rest of the delegation under instructions from Rome. He had already left before the meeting this afternoon, so he did not attend. The resolution stated that the new steps taken by the Italian government (regarding the severe new measures) require more time for consideration. Before the vote, the Albanian representative, Marian, requested the Administrative Council to severely criticize the Italian government's new policy and earnestly implement sanctions against Italy with all its might, so that all countries, large and small, can be protected from the arbitrary treatment of their neighbors. The Albanian representative also said that this is a time of crisis for Albania's survival. Not only the future of the League of Nations, but even its survival depends on this resolution. The Chilean representative said that the war is now over, and continuing sanctions is like shooting arrows at a target without a purpose, so he did not vote. The Ecuadorian representative said that his government has decided to abolish sanctions against Italy. (Twelfth Day Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Italian-Albanian Dispute: League of Nations Postpones Discussion; Administrative Council Passes Resolution</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council held a closed-door meeting at 3:00 p.m. today. League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol submitted a report, stating briefly that "he received a notification from the Italian representative Aloisi at noon stating that the Italian delegation had been instructed by the government to leave Geneva immediately accordingly. As to why the government adopted this resolution, Aloisi did not explain." The Administrative Council then decided to hold a public meeting and invited the Albanian representative to attend to study the issue of postponing the discussion of the Italian-Albanian dispute. Then, at 5:20, it held a public meeting and the representatives of all the council member states, except for the Chilean representative who abstained, unanimously passed a resolution deciding that the Italian-Albanian dispute should be discussed again at the extraordinary meeting to be held on June 15, and that from now until then, the current sanctions measures should continue to be maintained. (According to Chilean representative Vicuña, before the Administrative Council meeting today, he sent a letter to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol stating that since the Italian-Albanian war has now ended, the economic and financial sanctions against Italy should be lifted immediately.)</p>
<p>Chairman Eden, the British Foreign Secretary, read the full text of the resolution to the public. The text stated: "The Administrative Council, in view of the serious steps taken by the Italian government (referring to the annexation of Abyssinia), has created a new situation and believes that it is necessary to postpone the discussion so that the council member states can fully study this situation. Therefore, it is decided to re-discuss this issue on June 15. The measures currently taken by the member states of the League of Nations (referring to sanctions measures) should not be changed for the time being."</p>
<p>After the Chairman finished reading, the Albanian representative Ward made a statement, stating that the people of his country are determined to continue resisting the Italian aggression, and said that the Italian-Albanian dispute is not only a dispute between the two countries concerned, but a dispute between Italy and the League of Nations. The fate of the League of Nations depends on how this case is resolved. Therefore, the Administrative Council must implement all the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant, so that all countries can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>The Argentine representative Gnazzi rose to speak and stated that his country expressed its support for the resolution, but submitted a reservation regarding the postponement of the discussion. The Chilean representative Vicuña expressed his opposition to the continued maintenance of sanctions measures, and expressed his support for the postponement of the discussion. The Ecuadorian representative Chirden explained that after the cessation of the Italian-Albanian war, his government had already lifted the sanctions measures. At 5:40, the Chairman announced the adjournment and decided to hold another meeting tomorrow to postpone the Locarno case to the extraordinary meeting to be held in June, and to pass the reports of various important issues one by one in order to conclude this session. The general public believes that the Italian government will issue an official document soon regarding the reasons for instructing its delegation to return home. (Twelfth Day Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Italian Delegation Leaves Geneva to Return Home: What Is the Truth Remains a Matter of Speculation</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Aloisi, the Italian representative to Geneva, dissatisfied with the attitude of the League of Nations Administrative Council, departed today with the entire Italian delegation. According to responsible sources, Rome issued instructions to withdraw its representatives in light of the developments of the past few days. Although Rome acknowledges that this contains great significance, it is not yet certain what Italy will do. The general public is speculating whether this is a sign that Italy will completely withdraw from the League of Nations. When the Italian delegation left, the Italians working here and those employed by the League of Nations all went to see them off. (Twelfth Day Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The League of Nations Italian delegation returned to its country from Geneva this afternoon. Italian people here interpreted this move, saying it should not be regarded as a sign that Italy is about to withdraw from the League of Nations. Its purpose is only to express that if the Italian-Albanian problem is not resolved for one day, Italy will not be able to participate in cooperation in European affairs for one day. (Twelfth Day Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the Italian government ordered its representative Aloisi and his party to return home, as of now, the general public here still does not know the truth, but most believe that Italy is currently bound to refuse to participate in all actions of the League of Nations, and will certainly not agree to explain its attitude before the Administrative Council convenes an extraordinary meeting on June 15. Those who are pessimistic believe that this move by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is to suggest that the League of Nations member states must change their attitude before June 15. In other words, the current sanctions measures must be lifted, the Italian-Albanian dispute must be removed from the Administrative Council's agenda, the Italian King Victor Emmanuel III must be recognized as the Emperor of Abyssinia, and the Albanian representative must also be refused participation in the League of Nations meetings. Otherwise, Italy will withdraw from the League of Nations in retaliation. (Thirteenth Day Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) Speculation is still rife here today about the question of Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations. The general opinion in political circles is that Prime Minister Mussolini's instruction to the Italian delegation to leave Geneva will cause serious developments. Although officials are unwilling to express their opinions on this, observers believe that since Mussolini insists that the League of Nations must not interfere in the Abyssinian problem, it can be seen that there has been a drastic change in Italy's foreign policy. The Chamber of Deputies will meet on Thursday to approve the annexation of Abyssinia, and it remains to be seen whether Mussolini will make an important declaration at that time. (Twelfth Day National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) All newspapers are shocked that Aloisi, the chief representative of the League of Nations Italian delegation, suddenly left Geneva yesterday with all members of the delegation to return to his country. The Petit Parisian newspaper carried a report stating, "If Italy's move is only a warning, then there may be room for maneuver. On the contrary, if the country's representatives leave for good, then not only will the League of Nations lose a pillar, but the European community will also lose a good friend to cooperate with. As for the relationship between Italy and France, it will be a miracle if it can still be friendly and unquestioning after this incident." The Business newspaper carried a report stating, "The only hope for the League of Nations Administrative Council when it holds an extraordinary meeting on June 15 is that Italy will agree to cooperate in various European events as the price for all countries and the League of Nations to recognize its management of Abyssinia. Therefore, there are now some countries hoping that the United Kingdom and France can ask Italy some clear questions to know what attitude the country intends to take in Central Europe, the Mediterranean, or the Rhine region under certain circumstances." However, other member states believe that this method is to use the Abyssinian nation as a medium for trading and engaging in buying and selling behavior, and it is inevitable that they will fall into injustice, so they expressed their opposition.

<h3>British Press Reacts with Cold Cynicism</h3>
<p>(London) After the League of Nations Italian delegation returned from Geneva yesterday, all newspapers here commented on it. Those belonging to the left wing were all happy with the wording, while those belonging to the right wing criticized the League of Nations. The News Chronicle, the organ of the Liberal Party, carried a report stating, "We hope that Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations can be seen as a fact soon, because in truth, Italy should have been expelled from the League of Nations long ago." The Daily Herald, the organ of the Labor Party, carried a report stating, "The fact that Geneva still had the footprints of the Italian delegation was already unpleasant for people, and strictly speaking, according to the text of the League of Nations Covenant, Aloisi and his colleagues should have been expelled long ago. The fact that these unwelcome elements are now being ordered to return home by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini can be said to be the first meritorious service to the League of Nations." The right-wing Morning Post carried a report stating, "If the League of Nations argues endlessly with Mussolini, it will inevitably be defeated by his hands. It should rein in the horse at the edge of the cliff and quickly revoke the sanctions measures. We have already gained some experience in the past twelve months, that is, to survive in this world and ensure safety, one must only rely on strength." (Thirteenth Day Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Rome) The Chamber of Deputies is scheduled to hold an extraordinary meeting this Thursday (the 14th) to approve the order of annexing Abyssinia. The Senate is scheduled to meet on Saturday (the 16th) to approve this order. When the Prime Minister officially read the annexation order at the Venice Palace last Saturday, the envoys of all countries that did not participate in the sanctions were present. The newspapers commented on this matter, saying that it was tantamount to tacitly recognizing what Italy had done. Semi-official sources said that the envoys of the countries concerned were invited and came only as a diplomatic courtesy, and had no political meaning. (Twelfth Day Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Italy: Developing Resources in Abyssinia; Committee Organized for Research, Rejecting Foreign Capital; Close Economic Ties Between Italy and Germany</h3>
<p>(Rome) Prime Minister Mussolini recently ordered Senator Volpi (Chairman of the National Industrial Groups Federation) to form several committees with representatives from relevant ministries and professional groups to conduct research on the development of Abyssinia's resources and to submit a report to the government based on the findings. These committees are expected to be established and begin work soon. It is Italy's hope to find copper, gold, iron, mica, nitrates, mercury, and crude oil deposits within Abyssinia. Related sources stated that the development of Abyssinia's resources will be based on the Fascist principles of justice, which are: "Natural resources should belong to the public and not be monopolized by a few capitalists." The necessary development funds should be borne solely by Italy, without seeking assistance from foreign capital. However, in terms of machinery, significant assistance will be required from the German industry, as Italy's existing mining machinery is insufficient. Italy will rely on foreign sources for supply, at least in the initial stages. Since the implementation of sanctions in November of last year, the Italian Industrial Groups Federation has frequently traded with German industry. Since the establishment of a barter agreement between the two countries, the volume of mutual trade is expected to increase significantly. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Minister of Agriculture, Rossoni, returned to the country a few days ago after an official visit to Germany. He was immediately received by Prime Minister Mussolini. It is rumored that the government intends to appoint Rossoni as Minister of National Economy to oversee the development of Abyssinia's resources. This news has not been confirmed. According to semi-official sources, Rossoni's visit to Germany was to discuss economic relations between Italy and Germany. During his stay in Germany, he received preferential treatment from members of the National Socialist Party. He had originally planned to stay longer, but was recalled by the government to attend the Fascist Party's Supreme Council meeting last Saturday. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(Brussels) The Italian Ambassador to Belgium delivered a note to the Belgian government, stating that Italy has annexed Abyssinia. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the occupation of Abyssinia's capital by Italian forces, the Japanese government suddenly announced the recall of the current representative to Abyssinia, Suzuki, and appointed Asada Kousuke, an official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Trade Bureau, as his replacement. The intention behind this move is unclear to all parties. Asada departed from Kobe on the Haruna Maru yesterday morning. (China United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Italian government notified the Japanese government that Italy has merged all of Abyssinia and that the Italian Emperor has assumed the title of Emperor of Abyssinia, while fully protecting Japan's interests in Abyssinia, requesting Japan's understanding. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs recognizes the military and civilian administration led by General Badoglio as the authority on the ground and will continue negotiations with them. However, this does not constitute recognition of the annexation. Japan will continue to maintain a policy of watchful waiting regarding the annexation issue. (Dentsu dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Discusses Foreign Policy; Lloyd George Criticizes the Government</h3>
<p>(London) The House of Commons recently discussed foreign policy. Member of Parliament Cox of the opposition Labour Party raised a question, asking whether the British government was prepared to notify Italian Prime Minister Mussolini that it would not recognize the annexation of Abyssinia. Prime Minister Baldwin, on behalf of Foreign Secretary Eden (currently in Geneva), replied that Britain's policy regarding the Italo-Abyssinian dispute was based on the collective action of the member states of the League of Nations, as had been repeatedly declared. Cox subsequently stated that Italy should no longer be allowed to remain in the League of Nations. The Prime Minister then replied that it would be inappropriate at this time to propose forcing Italy to withdraw from the League of Nations (Article 16, Paragraph 4 of the League of Nations Covenant contains provisions for this). (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources, the government is about to recall Sir Barton, the British Minister to Abyssinia, leaving only a consul stationed in the Abyssinian capital. Sir Barton was appointed to Abyssinia to negotiate with the Abyssinian government on behalf of Britain. Now that that government no longer exists, there is no need for a British Minister to remain in Abyssinia. Furthermore, it is rumored that Britain will soon sever diplomatic relations with Italy. This has been denied by semi-official sources, who stated that the government is currently adopting a wait-and-see attitude for three reasons: 1. Italy's true intentions are not yet clear; 2. Germany has not yet responded to the British question; 3. A new French cabinet has not yet been formed. Until these three points are clarified, Britain is unwilling to take any action. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the new situation in the Italo-Abyssinian issue, most members of parliament in the parliamentary tearoom believe that the cabinet does not intend to take a tough stance at this time, but they are not unwilling to see the issue resolved as soon as possible, they just haven't announced it publicly. In general, as long as Britain's interests in Egypt are not threatened by Italy, the government is unwilling to go to war with Italy. This can be seen in the recent recall of many British warships in the Mediterranean to their home ports. However, young members of the Conservative Party and members of the clergy criticize Prime Minister Baldwin for lacking leadership and insist on taking strong action to deal with Italy. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) The Executive Committee of the Peace and Economic Reconstruction Movement recently met in the House of Commons this month. The initiator, former Prime Minister Lloyd George, delivered the opening speech, stating, "We should all be vigilant about what Abyssinia has recently experienced. Hypocritical sanctions have been delayed in many ways and then declared a failure, while effective sanctions have been refused. The peace plan formulated by former British Foreign Secretary Hoare and former French Prime Minister Laval was intended to partition Abyssinia in order to satisfy the private ambitions of the aggressor. It was extremely despicable, and yet it was proposed. After the Italian army used poison gas, countless innocent men, women, children, and elderly people in Abyssinia were poisoned, and the world supplied them with kerosene, which ultimately led to the devastation of the land that we were supposed to protect according to the League of Nations Covenant." Lloyd George then turned his attention to domestic politics, stating, "Before the parliamentary re-election last winter, this association formulated a political program, listing our association's various positions on domestic and foreign affairs. Most of them were usurped by the majority party represented by the current cabinet. At that time, most candidates used this association's political program as a guide, advocating for the maintenance of peace, economic recovery, and unemployment relief. However, once most of these candidates were elected to parliament, they forgot about it and did not implement it urgently. But what is the result of these people usurping this association's political program? We now know it very well. In a word, the general public has universally felt disappointed with the current situation. I say this not to ridicule others, but to make people aware of the true meaning of elections, so that they do not repeat the same mistakes." (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>British People Also Dislike the League of Nations; Five European Countries Organize a Committee to Guarantee Peace; Lord Sembill's Proposal</h3>
<p>(London) At today's meeting of the House of Lords, Lord Sembill delivered a speech, advocating that a committee be formed by the five countries of Britain, Germany, France, Italy, and Russia to guarantee peace in Europe. He also stated that "Britain does not have the mission to reform the world, so as far as Britain is concerned, it is better if the League of Nations does not exist." (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>British Budget Leak; Extensive Involvement in Political Circles; Cabinet Position Begins to Shake</h3>
<p>(London) The cabinet is scheduled to hold its weekly meeting today to discuss three issues: 1. The diplomatic situation; 2. Italy's accusations that Britain supplied Abyssinia with dumdum bullets; 3. The propaganda campaign conducted by Italy amidst the conflicts between Jewish and Arab peoples in Palestine. However, Foreign Secretary Eden is still in Geneva at this time, and the cabinet is unlikely to take substantive action until he returns. In addition, regarding the issue of the leaked budget content, the government has obtained concrete results after investigation. Many political figures are involved, and even Colonial Secretary Thomas and his son are suspected. It is generally believed that the cabinet's position may be shaken as a result, which is not certain. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>

It is reported that the US representative to Abyssinia, Engelhard, may remain in the Abyssinian capital indefinitely. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Italian Ambassador to the United States, Rosso, visited Secretary of State Hull today, formally notifying him of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia.

<h3>Rumors of Cabinet Reshuffle in Austria; Limited to Technical Matters; No Change in Political Orientation</h3>
<p>(Vienna) It is generally believed that the Schuschnigg cabinet will be reshuffled this week. The talk of a reshuffle had been circulating for six weeks before being postponed indefinitely. It is now being mentioned again, apparently as a result of the conflict between the Heimwehr and the Free Union last week (see separate dispatch). It is reported that the planned changes to cabinet positions are limited to those of a technical nature, and there will be no change in political orientation. Approximately, the position of Minister of Defense will be concurrently held by Prime Minister Schuschnigg.

<h3>Private Goods Rampant: Tianjin Customs Losses Estimated; Military Supplies by the Boxcar-Load Start Arriving in Tianjin, Oversupply Leads to Diversion to Eastern Shandong</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: According to a recent investigation by Tianjin Customs, from May 5th to May 12th, in just one week, the following goods were smuggled into Tianjin from places like Dongnan Dasi, Beidaihe, Liushouying, and Changli: 13 million kilograms of rayon, 6.03 million kilograms of sugar, 30,000 kilograms of cigarette paper, 3,000 bundles of cotton cloth, 8,000 packages of marine sundries, and 4,775 cases of kerosene and gasoline. The amount is far greater than in the past. Previously, smuggled goods were limited to rayon, sugar, cotton cloth, and cigarette paper. Recently, foreign wines, sodas, sodas, candles, needles, porcelain, plain iron, printing paper, and steel plates, etc., have all been transported using tax evasion methods. Unless the items are bulky and require time to load and transport, smugglers can find ways to transport almost anything. On the 12th, twenty boxes of handguns, with twenty guns in each box, were transported from Nandasi. Half of the shipment was unloaded in Tianjin and moved to a certain concession, while the other half was transported to Beiping by car. Customs believes that this type of military smuggling is only the beginning, and more will be shipped in continuously. Whether the supply side belongs to bandits or has other uses is a matter that deserves great attention. According to customs officials familiar with the situation in Dalian, Dalian was a prosperous port in 1905 and had designated an area as a free trade zone. All goods, regardless of nationality, could be loaded into the port without tax. This system still exists today and has become a base for smugglers. Therefore, tax-evading goods are not limited to products from a certain country; European and American goods can also be accommodated in the area and then transported to eastern Hebei.</p>
<p>Customs estimates that since last August, the rampant smuggling has caused the Tianjin Customs alone to lose more than 10 million gold units in tax revenue. In March and April of this year, the Tianjin East Railway Station alone was losing an average of 10,000 to 15,000 yuan per day in tax revenue. From January to April of this year, tax revenue decreased by half compared to the same period last year. The peak season is approaching, and if there are no good policies to stop smuggling, the total customs revenue for this year will be unimaginable. Xiao Xichao, the special commissioner sent by the Ministry of Finance to inspect the smuggling situation, has completed his investigation in Tianjin. Recently, the Director of the Anti-Smuggling Division of the Customs Service, Bai Licza, came to the north and also inspected the current smuggling situation. On the 9th, he exchanged views at the Tianjin Customs. Those present at the same time included Lin Shize, Superintendent of Tianjin Customs; Xu Liya, Chief of Tianjin Customs; Spu, Chief of the Anti-Smuggling Division of Tianjin Customs; and Chen Gongzhe, Chief of the Third Section of the Tianjin Municipal Government. As a result of the discussion, an opinion was decided, and Xiao Xichao immediately took it back to Beijing to submit it to the ministry for review. The Customs feels that although there are methods available now, it is difficult to implement them satisfactorily under special circumstances. Moreover, the railway is under external pressure, and it is difficult to ensure that the anti-smuggling agreement promulgated on February 21 is strictly followed. If the Customs uses armed anti-smuggling measures, it can still be handled at sea, because the smuggling ships of Japanese ronin have limited military power. Each time they smuggle, they can never form dozens of ships to sail in a fleet, so Customs gunboats have the power to deal with them. However, when it comes to land smuggling, there are ronin everywhere. Once discovered and detained, a call from the ronin can easily gather dozens or hundreds of people to commit violence and assault, inevitably leading to bloodshed. As a result, the goods may not be seized, and it only provokes bloodshed and humiliation. Therefore, it is argued that the anti-smuggling methods of the Ministry of Finance have many difficulties in implementation and must be changed. Bai Licza and Xiao Xichao will separately present this view to the central government when they return south. The Customs plans to follow the instructions of the central government and continue to discuss with the Beining and Jinpu Railway Bureaus to find appropriate and practical anti-smuggling methods, hoping that the railway authorities will fully assist. If the railway does not evade, negotiations can begin soon. Bai Licza went to Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe last Saturday and Sunday to investigate the current situation of smuggling. He returned on Sunday and transferred to Qingdao that night to inspect. Smuggling has also been discovered there recently. Japanese ronin are transporting smuggled goods from eastern Hebei to Tianjin, which is becoming increasingly common. They are piled up in a certain concession, and sales are slow for a time. Shops in the pseudo-area of eastern Hebei are affected by the influx of smuggled goods. Large merchants cannot sustain themselves and reduce their business scope, while small merchants are unable to struggle and eventually close down. No matter how cheap the smuggled goods are, they cannot be purchased, and the market is completely dead. Tianjin, on the other hand, has too much inventory, making it difficult to re-export and sell. The amount of accumulated goods is gradually increasing, and the ronin have to find another way. Therefore, most of the smuggled goods shipped by steamship from Dalian are now being diverted to Qingdao and the Jiaodong area, on the one hand, dumping them in eastern Shandong, and on the other hand, transporting them to the south bank of the Yellow River. The scope of smuggling is becoming wider and wider, and it is increasingly felt that there is no perfect way to combat smuggling. Xiao Zhenying advocates armed anti-smuggling, with the cooperation of the army, navy, police, and other agencies, regardless of responsibility, and a slight reduction in tariff rates. He also advocates opening up diplomatic channels to eliminate obstacles. Only then can the problem be completely eradicated. Therefore, he plans to formulate a strategy and send personnel to Beijing to present it to the Ministry of Finance, hoping to be approved. At a time when there is no way to combat smuggling in North China, it may be possible to obtain central approval.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Beining Railway issued nine regulations restricting cargo space because too many smuggled goods have arrived recently, and a certain concession cannot store them, so they occupy the cargo yards of the station, claiming to be transported out, but in fact, they do not even pay the station fees. Therefore, the new regulations are intended to restrict this. Those who rent the station must pay fees according to regulations and transport the goods to the site within 24 hours. Each person must not rent more than two sites at a time. If the prescribed time is exceeded, additional rental fees must be paid. (13th)</p>
<h3>Compatriots in Guangzhou Bay Petition for Tax Exemption; Bloodshed Incident; Famine in Disaster Year, Unable to Pay Poll Tax; Vietnamese Soldiers Open Fire, Killing and Wounding More Than a Dozen People; Refugees Flee to Chinese Territory for Refuge</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: A case of local officers and soldiers shooting and killing many refugees occurred in Guangzhou Bay. The details are extremely complicated, and outsiders are mostly unaware of the truth. According to an account of the tragic incident from returned overseas Chinese in the bay, the situation is very detailed. It is lamentable that overseas Chinese in weak countries are subjected to human slaughter everywhere. According to reports, the tragic incident occurred in the South Second District and South Third District of the French-controlled Guangzhou Bay (these two districts formerly belonged to Wuchuan County, Guangdong Province). The area has recently suffered from repeated droughts and floods. Last winter and this spring, the rice harvest was poor, and the people lacked food. To save lives was to be fearless, causing people to become displaced. However, the French government not only did not show compassion but also wanted to drain the pond to catch all the fish. To increase government revenue, on the 20th of last year, troops were sent to the two districts to forcibly collect service tax. All men from the age of twenty to fifty were required to serve the government. Those who wanted to be exempt from service had to pay a service tax (paying four French coins, equivalent to one yuan in national currency, to offset one day of labor). The villagers did not have enough daily income and could not afford to pay the tax. Seeing this situation, more than 2,000 village chiefs resigned. Because the _ officer of the Bo Xian camp (French soldiers) _, sent troops to _ forcibly collect _, detained village councilors, and _ threatened _ them. _ Furthermore, _ troops _ of French _ soldiers _ and Southern soldiers were sent to the South Third District. The villagers were frightened and fled, helping the old and carrying the young, in an extremely miserable state. Those who did not have time to escape mostly starved and were on the verge of death. On April 23rd, Chinese merchants in Chikan (place name) witnessed the plight of the famine victims in the South Second and South Third Districts and raised donations to purchase more than 3,000 bags of rice, which were transported to Potou for distribution. More than 30,000 famine victims gathered unexpectedly. The French camp officer in Potou, fearing that the refugees would affect security, immediately sent a centurion (i.e., a military system with 100 men under his command) Lu Wenqun, leading troops to drive them away, opening fire and attacking the crowd, killing three refugees, Chen Shixuan, Xu Afu, and Li Qifu, and others. The crowd was greatly angered as a result and pursued the murderers to the front of the Public Security Bureau. The crowd was shot and killed again, Chen Qinggui, Li Zhihe, and others. Twelve people, including Dong Macheng, were injured by gunfire. The crowd's anger could no longer be contained. Coincidentally, they encountered Public Security Bureau members Zhang Jiwen and Guan Qianchu, and there were conflicts between them. The French soldiers then exerted great pressure and fabricated facts, falsely accusing the crowd of causing trouble, and detained the 3,000 bags of relief rice. The refugees, feeling that they had been innocently massacred and their relief rice detained, elected representatives to send telegrams, appealing to all parties for support. An original telegram is appended as a decision: "Since Guangzhou Bay was leased to France in the year of Xinchou, our compatriots have groaned in pain under the iron hooves of the French for more than 30 years. At this time, our country is facing increasing foreign insults, the Northeast has fallen, and common disasters are lurking. The French treat our compatriots more oppressively. They treat the Annamites with cruel policies, but they turn around and treat the people of Guangzhou Bay with exploitation and tyrannical levies, regarding them as cattle and horses. Recently, they have planned to collect a poll tax and ordered all villages to report their able-bodied men quickly. The councilors of various villages in Potou, representing the compatriots, pleaded with tears, saying that it was a year of famine and local famine, begging them to consider the suffering of the people and postpone the implementation. This touched the anger of the Bo Tou camp officer of the French government, who fired shots to threaten them and detained four people. Subsequently, he ordered the Public Security Bureau under his jurisdiction to arrest three wealthy councilors from each district within three days and hand them over to the court for punishment. He also sent troops to garrison Tientou Village to demonstrate and intimidate, causing men and women to flee and the chickens and dogs to be restless. What crime did our compatriots commit to suffer this great disaster? On the (23rd), our compatriots, having no other choice, went to the Bo Tou camp officer empty-handed to petition, asking to exempt them from the poll tax and to withdraw the troops. They were shot and killed by the soldiers of the French Public Bureau, Li Qifu, Chen Shixuan, Xu Afu, Chen Zhihe, Chen Qinggui, and others, and twelve people, including Dong Mawei, were injured by gunfire. They continued to kill arbitrarily, and the people fled to Chinese territory. We believe that the hundreds of thousands of compatriots in Guangzhou Bay were originally citizens of the Republic of China, and our government cannot turn a blind eye to their suffering. At this time of deep water and fire, with no way to call for help and no way to turn, we, on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of people in Guangzhou Bay, run around and cry out to our National Government, pouring out our grievances, begging you to have pity and rescue the refugees from water and fire and bring them to safety. We cannot bear to wait in tears. Refugees' representatives from the Guangzhou Bay Concession, Chen Bao, Xu Qing, Zhang Lin, Li Rilong, Huang Benhan, together weep and kowtow with seals," (May 8th).</p>
<h3>Chairman Yu Xuezhong of Gansu Province Concerned About the Suffering of the People; Convenes an Emergency Relief Meeting; Prohibits Military from Apportioning</h3>
<p>Lanzhou Correspondence: Chairman Yu of the Gansu Provincial Government is very active in all aspects of administration, especially concerned about the suffering of the people. The following is a record of recent administrative situations:</p>
<p>Handling Emergency Relief in Hexi: Chairman Yu of the Provincial Government, considering the severe disaster situation in various counties in Hexi, which urgently needs relief, specially convened more than 50 leaders of various agencies and legal entities in the provincial capital to discuss emergency relief measures. As a result, six measures were decided: _ All leaders of agencies and legal entities will be listed as initiators; _ The Provincial Government will be responsible for drafting and printing donation notices and donation booklets; _ The Provincial Relief Committee will be responsible for the handling agency without forming another organization; _ Leaders of the party, government, and military will telegraph the central government to allocate funds, and at the same time, various legal entities will telegraph to request relief; _ Student fundraising should be handled by the school authorities at their discretion; _ Other detailed measures will be planned by the Accounting Committee.</p>
<p>Rectifying the Granary Administration of Various Counties: The management expenses of the granaries in various counties of Gansu Province should be paid from local public funds and should not use grain funds and interest. The Provincial Government had previously issued a notice for compliance. Recently, Chairman Yu stated that various counties still allocate funds from grain funds and interest for the management of granary expenses, which is not appropriate. He ordered all county heads to use the grain funds and interest for the purchase of grain and price stabilization. If they still use them without authorization, they will be held responsible for compensation to emphasize granary administration.</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibiting Team Raids: Chairman Yu stated that security teams in various counties often privately apportion grain and arbitrarily extort money, resulting in too heavy a burden on the people, making it impossible for them to make a living. This should be strictly prohibited to alleviate the people's difficulties. In the future, the supplies needed by security teams in various counties must be properly planned by the counties and must not be privately apportioned, especially arbitrarily extorted. If anyone dares to violate this, they will be severely punished. It is heard that a notice has been issued to all counties for compliance.</p>
<p>Rectifying the County Militia Teams: The county militia teams were originally established to protect the local area and maintain public order. All militiamen should be selected locally to ensure their permanence. The Provincial Government recently investigated that many militiamen in the county militia teams are from other provinces or are hooligans, which is inappropriate. It has ordered all county governments to strictly rectify the militia teams in the future and not to recruit militiamen from other provinces or hooligans to show prudence.</p>
<h3>The Border Areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces Suffer Severe Disasters; The China Relief Commission Allocates 25,000 Yuan for Relief; Setting Up Soup Kitchens and Disaster-Stricken Children's Shelters</h3>
<p>(Wuhu) Correspondence: The border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces have suffered repeated banditry, droughts, and strange disasters for years, resulting in thousands of miles of barren land where no grass or trees grow. Now that the banditry has gradually been cleared up, the famine is becoming more and more serious. The tragedy of people eating people has become commonplace. Wei Lihuang, the Commander-in-Chief of the Suppression of Bandits in the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces, and charitable organizations in the counties have repeatedly appealed to all parties, requesting early relief. It is heard that the Central Relief Commission has allocated 25,000 yuan and sent Commissioner Tang to the most severely affected Huoqiu County and its vicinity to provide emergency relief. The China International Famine Relief Commission has allocated 4,800 yuan and entrusted Father Lan of the Catholic Church in Huoqiu to provide relief on its behalf. The Anhui Provincial Disaster Area Relief Committee has also sent personnel to provide relief. The World Red Swastika Society's Joint Office for Central and Southern Anhui has raised more than 5,000 yuan in relief funds from all parties and sent Liu Xichun, the president of the Wuhu branch, and others to the area for distribution. According to Liu's telegram to the Wuhu News, the relief personnel sent by all parties have arrived in the disaster area one after another. Huoqiu County has 300,000 disaster victims who cannot survive without relief. However, due to the severity of the disaster and the lack of funds, it is difficult to provide universal relief. After consultation among all parties, under the leadership of Commissioner Tang, 14 soup kitchens were opened in Huoqiu City and its countryside, with more than 10,000 people eating at each kitchen every day. In areas far from the soup kitchens, Tang also raised donations separately for relief. The World Red Swastika Society is responsible for providing relief in the 51 Bao areas in the southwestern countryside of Huoqiu, covering more than 300 li. In addition to distributing emergency relief in severely affected areas, it is also planned to open a soup kitchen in Yejiaji, 140 li from the city and close to the border with Henan, so that displaced disaster victims can have a place to seek food. The telegram detailed the severity of the disaster and expressed hope for raising funds quickly for assistance to proceed as soon as possible to save the majority of dying disaster victims.</p>
<p>In the Lu'an area, the local Red Swastika Society also sent a telegram to Wuhu yesterday, stating that hunger victims are everywhere in the urban area and nearby suburbs, with at least 5,000 people who cannot survive without relief. There are more disaster victims in the countryside, but there are no accurate statistics yet. A disaster-stricken children's shelter has been established to provide immediate relief to disaster-stricken children, and rice and grain are being purchased for distribution to disaster victims to help them survive.</p>
<p>The disaster situation in the rural areas of Hefei is also very serious, and telegrams requesting relief are arriving like snowflakes. The Central and Southern Anhui Office of the Red Swastika Society has recently raised thousands of yuan in relief funds from the Southeast General Office in Shanghai and plans to raise some more funds here to send personnel to various counties for distribution.

<h3>The Situation of Spring and Agricultural Relief in Xuzhou Prefecture; The Four Counties are Divided into Three Zones; Relief Funds are Still Feared to be Insufficient</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Xuzhou Prefecture's spring and agricultural relief efforts are being investigated and released by personnel dispatched by the Relief Committee and the Provincial Government. The four counties of Pei, Feng, Tongshan, and Pi have been divided into three zones. Qiu Xiang, the investigation and relief chief of the Pei-Feng zone, Wang Jiaji, the investigation and relief chief of the Tongshan zone, and Chen Huichen, the investigation and relief chief of the Pi County zone, have completed the investigation. Pei is starting to correct the early reports. As of now, the release has not been completed. Pei is the first, second, fifth, sixth, and seventh zones, 38 townships, 359 Bao, 26,889 households, 58,798 adults, and 50,176 children. Adults are given 1 yuan in relief, and children are given 50 cents in relief, for a total of 83,886 yuan in relief funds released. 8,218 households received agricultural relief, releasing 10,998 yuan and 50 cents. Feng is the second and third zones, 11 townships, 67 Bao, 5,518 households, 15,978 adults, and 7,534 children, totaling 19,745 yuan released in relief money. 1,943 households received agricultural relief, releasing 1,797 yuan. Tongshan is the second, third, sixth, eighth, and ninth zones. 18,581 spring relief tickets have been investigated and issued, with 62,236 yuan in relief funds to be released. 3,017 agricultural relief tickets have been issued, with 7,454 yuan in relief funds to be released. The investigation has been completed and is being distributed. Pi County has a more severe disaster situation and a wider disaster area, totaling 42,531 households, 93,907 adults, and 80,782 children, divided into seven grades of 2 yuan, 3 yuan, 4 yuan, 6 yuan, 8 yuan, 10 yuan, and 12 yuan, totaling 139,386 yuan in relief funds to be released. Pi County is divided into seven zones. Only the seventh zone is disaster-free. The disaster situation in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth zones is overlapping. In townships such as Tanshang and Qinren in the first zone, the water has not receded due to the breach of the Bulao River, making it difficult to sow. In the second zone, it is also difficult to sow in areas such as Lin Yun, Yunhe, Paoche, and Shagouhu due to the breach of the Dayushu. In the third zone, Yumin, Lujiacheng, Sanwangzhuang, Wuyuan, Hanlou, Guochang, and Zhangxinzhuang, and in the fourth zone, Shangyi, Dahanzhuang, Liujing, Dongxi Guanhu, and Jiangjiahudeng, etc., have suffered from both the Yellow River disaster and hailstorms. The fields are barren, and the scene is bleak. In the fifth zone, Yue Wang, Che Fushan, and Wangmu Mountain are located between drainage dams, and the water has not receded, reaching a depth of more than four feet. Townships such as Ni Jiao and Xie He are affected by the collapse of the Bulao River and have been turned into a vast expanse. In the sixth zone, the water in townships such as Xiliu, Jiakou, and Siyuan has not completely receded, and there is no way to cultivate. The strong have scattered to all directions, either to Su-Sui or to Lu-Wan. At present, those who have heard of the relief and returned are coming one after another and are given relief. The relief funds are still feared to be insufficient, so we still hope that the authorities will increase them. (12th)</p>
<h3>Starting from the 25th Year, Jiangsu Province Will Abolish Miscellaneous Levies, All of Which Have Been Passed Down for Many Years and Are Nearly Onerous, Totaling 13 Types and More Than 30,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: The burden of land tax in this province varies from county to county. Some have only 10 cents or a few cents of regular tax, while the surtax can be more than ten times that amount. The Finance Department is currently planning to reorganize it. Those with excessively low regular tax will be appropriately increased, and those with excessively high regular tax will be appropriately reduced. After the regular tax is re-divided, the surtax will be reduced. If the surtax with a fixed collection period expires, it will be ordered to stop collecting. The increased tax amount in various counties that have filed land reports, except for maintaining local education and other operating expenses, will all be used to offset the reduction of the surtax. There is also a type of item called "Miscellaneous Levies" in the land tax, which has a long history and is nearly onerous, totaling 23 types, including business tax, mill salary, fishing tax, comb base, hemp glue, hemp, yarn string, rouge powder, yellow and white wine tax, calico tobacco package tax, brokerage fee, horse grazing, cattle grazing, cattle and donkey tax, contract salary, extra, ministry post, tooth tax, cattle tax, living tax, pig and sheep tax, cattle and horse tax, and soup tax, totaling more than 32,619 yuan. It is heard that the above miscellaneous levies have been passed down for decades or hundreds of years. Among them, the "rouge powder" is the cosmetic fee for the deposed Qing imperial family, which is also imposed on the people. This shows the extravagance and extreme desire of the imperial era, and the meticulous harassment of the people. Although times have changed and the situation has shifted, these miscellaneous levies are still collected as usual. The Finance Department will abolish these 23 types of miscellaneous levies, except for those that are fundamentally illegal in nature, and will classify them into reasonable taxes such as business tax for collection based on their nature. It will be implemented starting from the 25th year.</p>

<h3>Wuxi: The Go-Slow Strike in the Foundry Industry Expands</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the suspension of work by workers, 17 foundries, including Xichenglongchang Sanxin, etc., have had go-slow strikes one after another on the previous day. By yesterday, the situation was expanding. The factory side published advertisements in the industry association, saying that the workers were demanding and threatening by going slow, while the labor side said that the factory side had voluntarily suspended medicine and framed the workers. Both sides held different views, and the dispute could not be resolved. Unexpectedly, one wave was not settled, and another rose. At about 10 a.m. yesterday (the 13th), suddenly 50 or 60 people resembling workers went to the Sanxin Foundry in Huinong Bridge and beat up the factory owners Hou Jiquan and Hou Zhu, as well as feeding them feces. Hou and others were humiliated and went to the local court at 2 p.m. to request an injury examination and request a ticket to summon the worker leaders Qian Chunsheng, Bao Acai, Gu Shiquan, Lu Yaozu, Shen Wenda, Zhou Yuquan, and Li Shenggen to the case for interrogation.

<h3>Sending Teams to Suppress Su-Xi Road</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in the past, due to the frequent reports of large groups of bandits along the Taihu Lake plotting to cause trouble, ordered the water and land police teams of the counties bordering the lake to hold a large-scale joint patrol in order to eliminate them in one fell swoop. Recently, it was reported that the Su-Xi Highway, which borders the Taihu Lake, is currently under construction, and there are many road workers, who are mostly of mixed quality. If there is incitement, it will be enough to disturb the neighbors. Therefore, it has ordered Zheng Dexin, the commander of the 6th Security Brigade of Wuxi Province, and Nie Dezhao, the commander of the 7th Brigade of Wu County, to each send a detachment of soldiers to garrison important places along the road, and to patrol and defend in the construction area at any time. Zheng and Nie have agreed to establish mutual contact and earnestly take responsibility for protection.</p>
<h3>Fire Destroys Tailong Flour Mill</h3>
<p>The Tailong Flour Mill, located north of the Yanshou Temple outside the East Gate, was established in the third year of the Republic of China by the late local resident Guo Huiping. Subsequently, due to poor business performance, it was sold to Sun Huabo of Fufeng Company for continued operation, but it still failed to generate profits. Last year, it was leased to Cantonese businessman Feng Qihuai, with He Zechun as manager, and the business showed some improvement. At the beginning of this month, due to a shortage of raw wheat, operations were temporarily suspended to prepare for machinery maintenance, with a scheduled resumption of work yesterday. Unexpectedly, at around 2:00 AM, an electrical fault occurred in the engine room near the west side of the chimney, causing a fire. The flames spread to the building on the north side, and the fire illuminated the sky. Various fire brigades responded to the alarm and rushed to put out the fire, but the fire was too strong, and their efforts were futile. The entire factory was completely burned down, including seven five-story buildings, three single-story buildings, the general accounting office, flour output room, public accounting office, and oil room, along with all the production machinery. The losses amounted to 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, making it an unprecedented major fire in recent years in Xiyi.</p>

His weight of judgment was great, and his great plans were remarkable. Recently, he devoted himself to national affairs, recuperating in the southeast, hoping for an early recovery of health and leadership in the central government.

<h3>Famous American Journalist Vanderbilt Discusses World Heroes; Says East Has Become a Center of World News</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News: Famous American railway tycoon, now a journalist, Mr. Vanderbilt, recently traveled the world and arrived in Shanghai from Japan yesterday, intending to stay for a week before heading to Europe via Siberia. He is accompanied by journalist Wabalin. Both are visiting the Far East for the first time. According to Mr. Vanderbilt, he intends to visit the capital, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Beijing, Shenyang, Seoul, and Harbin, before returning home via Moscow. He hopes to meet many famous leaders in China. During his two-week stay in Japan, he met many famous people in that country. He feels that Japan is currently on a volcano and is entering a critical transitional period. Whether the military can win will be known in the next two or three months. If the military wins, what will happen is unpredictable. Perhaps they will implement a direct military dictatorship or a fascist dictatorship. The general labor force bears a heavy burden and may rise up to urge the government to move towards a more democratic system, but this is unlikely to happen. Once the military knows that the people's resentment is deepening, they may use the Manchurian border incidents or deliberately create incidents to engage in propaganda at home, promote nationalism, and preemptively prevent social resentment from being vented. This is expected and can be watched with bated breath. The center of world news has now shifted to the East. News from Manchuria or the East is published on the front page of all newspapers. This is why he is traveling to the Far East. Famous journalists such as Gibbon and Durant are also coming to Shanghai to travel to the East. Although Japan feels peaceful on the surface now, embarrassment can be seen everywhere, and something may be brewing in secret. Mr. Vanderbilt has met famous European leaders such as Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin. He said that Hitler is a dangerous person and he does not admire him at all. If Hitler's policies continue, they will disrupt the whole world. Mussolini is a greater leader, and his measures are more beneficial than harmful to the country. However, his handling of Abyssinia is not very clever. He has visited the Soviet Union seven times, the most recent being in 1933. At that time, the domestic situation was better than in 1930. Stalin is the most powerful dictator and the greatest leader in the world today. He intends to visit Stalin and Gorky and other leaders on this visit to Russia. President Roosevelt is expected to be re-elected and may visit the Far East after winning the election. Mr. Vanderbilt recently published a book called "Farewell to Fifth Avenue," which is said to have sold 1.2 million copies in the United States alone and has been translated into 16 languages, selling 600,000 copies. His latest book, "A Woman of Washington," will be published soon. Mr. Vanderbilt is currently writing for several magazines and is very popular.</p>
<h3>Minsheng Company's Minqiang Ship Sinks After Hitting a Reef Yesterday Morning; Passengers Safe...One Cabin Boy Dies</h3>
<p>Minsheng Industrial Company's Minqiang ship is a shallow-water river boat that navigates between Shanghai, Yichang, and Chongqing. It has a carrying capacity of 239 tons, a registered tonnage of 166 tons, a hull length of 115 feet, a width of 20 feet, and a depth of 6.6 feet. On February 29th of this year, when it was launched in Chongqing, it hit a reef in the Dongyangzi River downstream of Yunyang. The bottom of the ship was caught on the reef, and river water flooded in, sinking it to the second deck and tilting it to 30 degrees. It took great effort and expense to rescue it, lasting more than a month. After repairing the hole, it was towed to Shanghai for a major overhaul, incurring significant losses. After the repairs were completed last month, it was loaded with cargo in Shanghai and sailed to Sichuan. However, due to the shallow water in the Sichuan River, navigation was interrupted, and the cargo was stored in Yichang. The ship then made a short trip, loading a large batch of goods in Yichang on the afternoon of the 11th of this month.</p>
<p>Departing from Yichang into Sichuan: Many passengers disembarked in Yichang, some traveling to Chongqing. Until yesterday (the 13th) morning, when it sailed downstream of Wanxian, near Wuling, at a place called Chayuzi on the river, where there are originally many reefs, which can still be seen in shallow water, allowing navigation to avoid them. Recently, the Sichuan River has been flooding, rushing thousands of miles, and the reefs on both sides have been submerged, making them difficult to see. Perhaps due to the pilot's negligence, it entered the reef cluster, causing</p>
<p>The Ship to Hit a Reef: The hull was caught on a reef, and the bottom of the ship was immediately pierced. When it was in shallow water last time, it was still washed to the second deck by the river water. The current flood in the Sichuan River caused the water to flood in, and the ship lost its center of gravity, and the furnaces were extinguished, making it impossible to move. The only option was to rescue the passengers and crew on board. After the accident, passengers on the ship rushed to the deck to escape. The ship owner had no choice but to first rescue all of the</p>
<p>Passengers: By using planks to create a temporary haven from the danger of sinking, while rescuing the crew members. However, one cabin boy could not be rescued and died. This time, the damage was very severe, and the river water flooded in very quickly. Within an hour or two, it sank into the water. The cargo inside the ship, mostly textiles and other imported goods, was also very expensive, and now it is all sunk in the Chayuzi on the river. Shanghai received the telegram yesterday afternoon. When the reporter received the news, he immediately went to Minsheng Company. According to Mr. Zhang Shulin, the manager in Shanghai, the Minqiang ship sank near Wuling yesterday morning after hitting a reef. All the passengers were rescued safely, and only one cabin boy died. There were no further details. The ship has marine insurance with the North America Company in this port.</p>
<p>Marine Insurance: After receiving the telegram, Minsheng General Company telegraphed the Wanxian branch to quickly find a way to rescue the passengers and crew to that location and transfer them to other company ships to travel upstream to Chongqing. Whether it can be rescued and salvaged, it has notified the insurance company yesterday to send personnel to inspect and make a decision. The ship's hull and cargo losses are at least 300,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Banking Association Discusses Opinions on Establishing Agricultural Capital Bureau</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Ministry of Industry, in conjunction with the national financial community, established the Agricultural Capital Bureau. Minister Wu has come to Shanghai twice to invite the financial community to discuss it. A general outline of the measures was agreed upon, and the Shanghai Banking Association sent a letter to solicit opinions from all parties. Yesterday, the association held another meeting to discuss it and decided to send it to the Ministry of Industry for discussion at the third meeting. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Banking Association Held Discussions Yesterday: The Banking Association has collected opinions on the establishment of the Agricultural Capital Bureau, and 25 responses have been received. Most expressed agreement, but only four or five had suggestions for revising the agreed-upon general outline of the measures. The association held a special meeting to discuss it yesterday, attended by representatives from various banks, including Sun Jingxi, Wang Boyuan, Wu Rencang, Xi Demao, Yao Yinpeng, Lu Fengjiu, Wu Weiru, Hu Mengjia, Song Hanzhang, Wang Lengbo, Wu Yunzhai, Bei Songsun, Tong Zhaodao, Zhu Miaosheng, Liu Zhengyun, Huang Yuyi, Chen Yingsheng, Qu Jigang, Chen Hang, Pan Jiufen, Wang Shaoxian, Li Zhongchu, Hu Xian, Ye Fuxiao, Zhang Zhuyu, Wu Xizhi, Wang Yansong, Li Fusun, Zhu Runsheng, Zhang Peishen, Shi Boqun, Qian Xinzhi, Zou Bingwen, and Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the association, and over 30 others, chaired by Wu Yunzhai. He reported that 25 responses had been received and read out the opinions put forward by various parties. It was decided to collect them and submit them to the Ministry of Industry for discussion at the third meeting.</p>
<p>Collecting Opinions and Submitting to the Ministry of Industry: According to reporters' inquiries from various parties, the financial community strongly agrees with the organization of the Agricultural Capital Bureau and hopes that it can be established as soon as possible. To seek the revival of China's rural economy, this type of organization is extremely necessary. However, in addition to assisting the government and society in their construction efforts, banks should seek to ensure the stability of their investments and the favorability of interest rates. Therefore, some parties suggest that the government and the financial community should cooperate effectively, as stipulated in the general outline of measures, with both parties contributing funds, selecting directors, and participating in joint efforts so that both parties can effectively assume responsibility for the implementation of the business. Others advocate for a division of labor and cooperation to leverage each party's strengths. Still others request that the government guarantee the principal and interest and request an increase in interest rates. However, all agree with the principles of its organization. The Banking Association is currently collecting and submitting the opinions to the Ministry of Industry. Minister Wu is expected to come to Shanghai this weekend to convene the third meeting for discussion, and concrete decisions are expected to be made.</p>
<h3>Business and Industry Telegraph to Urge a Stop to Smuggling in North China</h3>
<p>Since smuggling in North China began, it has gradually spread from Tianjin and Beijing to the Yangtze River inland areas. The impact is not only the loss of national tax revenue and direct damage to industry and commerce, but also the indirect loss of livelihood for workers. The business and industrial sectors feel this acutely and telegraphed the authorities yesterday to urge strict measures to stop it. The following is a record:</p>
<p>The Municipal General Labor Union telegraphed the Executive Yuan and Ministries yesterday, saying: "To President Jiang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry: As reported in the news, smuggling in North China is becoming increasingly serious. At a time when the market is sluggish, all industries are depressed, and the number of unemployed is soaring, such a large amount of tax evasion and free private transportation not only affects national fiscal revenue, but also the endangered national industry will also be destroyed, and our laboring workers will suffer even greater blows. To protect the national industry and stabilize the livelihood of the workers, this association cannot remain silent and sends this telegram to appeal. We urge the President of the Executive Yuan to immediately implement effective measures and strictly crack down to maintain national taxes and protect sovereignty. We respectfully send this telegram, awaiting your urgent orders. Zhou Xuexiang, acting chairman of the Shanghai General Labor Union, Standing Committee members Li Mengnan, Zhang Kechang, Ye Xianggao, Shao Xubai, Long Peiyun, respectfully bow."</p>
<p>The Electrical Machinery and Stockings Industry Association, recently in view of the rampant smuggling in North China, and the government's intention to appropriately reduce import taxes on sugar and rayon, believes that this matter not only affects national tax revenue but also harms industrial development, and is therefore serious and significant. Therefore, an executive committee meeting was convened at the association's location on Hankou Road the day before yesterday afternoon to discuss all matters. It was generally agreed that using the smuggling issue to coerce tax reductions is not motivated by pure intentions, and there is no guarantee that tax reductions will actually stop smuggling. Therefore, the tax reduction issue is related to the development of our country's industry and the national economy and is truly harmful and not beneficial. The meeting resulted in Chairman Cai Shengbai preparing a document to submit to the government, requesting that the original tariffs be maintained and that effective measures be taken to stop smuggling in North China. The following is the text submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance: "We submit this document to request that you quickly adopt effective measures to stop smuggling in North China and maintain the original tariffs to protect the national treasury's tax revenue. We have read in the newspapers that smuggling in North China is becoming increasingly rampant and has recently spread to various places, eroding without limit. There are rumors that the government intends to reduce the import tax on sugar and rayon, etc. We investigate that smuggling in North China harms our country's production to a profound and significant degree. At a time when the national goods business is just budding and thriving, and the market is depressed and businesses are stagnant, it is already difficult to progress, let alone suffer this unexpected attack and a major injury. Therefore, the impact of smuggling in North China is not only to make our tax revenue short, but also to disrupt the market. The production of national goods is almost entirely deprived. If we do not take measures to stop it, then our country's industry and commerce will inevitably collapse completely and fall into bankruptcy. The association is a silk weaving industry group, and in terms of the rayon raw material for weaving, the news and information about smuggling are more closely related. Recently, in Shanghai, foreign warships have even hoisted flags and openly loaded and transported rayon, blatantly importing and unloading from Wusong. This large amount of tax evasion has caused a huge loss to our tax revenue, and the chaos in the market price of national goods and the stagnation of sales have also been greatly affected recently. The association feels the pain and is more deeply concerned and dares not remain silent. We should prepare a document to submit, asking that you quickly adopt effective measures to stop smuggling in North China, and earnestly request that you maintain the original tax rates for the import tariffs levied so as not to confuse the market and save the precarious situation of national goods. The anticipation is extreme."</p>
<h3>Customs Authority Report: North China Smuggling: Statistics on Tax Revenue Losses (Continued) - A Major Incident Unprecedented in Chinese Customs History</h3>
<p>Since the expansion of smuggling in North China, customs anti-smuggling personnel have frequently encountered smugglers and lawbreakers. These rogues mostly carry firearms, while customs officers are unarmed, creating a stark contrast. It is clearly impossible for a small number of customs officers, unarmed, to control armed smugglers and bring them to justice. Moreover, customs officers are often attacked by smugglers when performing their duties, resulting in serious injuries. On January 5th of this year, Japanese and Korean vagrants even threatened customs officers, vowing to kill them. Previously, the Qinhuangdao Customs, near Houzhuang, seized nine trucks of smuggled liquor escorted to Qin Island by one Japanese and one Korean. When customs officers approached to detain them, the Korean suddenly attacked the officers with an axe. Fortunately, six farmers passing by helped the officers disarm him and escort the trucks to the Shanhai Pass tax station. At about 12 o'clock that afternoon, three Japanese men arrived at the tax station, demanding the release of the smuggled goods with a menacing attitude. The customs officers told them that all the smuggled goods had been transported to the main station. Enraged, one of the three Japanese men slapped the customs officer in the face, searched the room, seized the confiscated axe, and threatened to kill the officer before leaving. Another incident occurred on February 18th when customs authorities seized a quantity of smuggled kerosene. Thugs swarmed the customs station, seizing part of the smuggled goods, while the other five severely beat two guards, one of whom sustained serious head injuries. Unsatisfied, the five thugs stormed into the station, attacking anyone they encountered. At the time, Japanese consular police witnessed the incident but did not intervene. On another occasion, the Shanhai Pass Investigation Team discovered that some Koreans were attempting to smuggle silver coins out of the Great Wall. As soon as they approached to inquire, the Koreans pelted them with stones, forcing the customs officers to retreat to the customs station. One of the guards was injured by a stone. Furthermore, the customs investigation team went to Dapuhe to investigate smuggled sugar and found ten donkey carts loaded with smuggled sugar by the sea. Upon seeing the customs officers, the smugglers scattered in all directions on the donkey carts. The investigation team managed to catch several carts, including seventeen bags of white sugar. Just as they were about to escort them to the customs station, a Japanese policeman passing by advised the customs officers to release the smuggled sugar, stating that he could not be responsible if any incidents occurred. The team refused and still escorted the smuggled goods to the customs station. Immediately, some Koreans broke in and seized all the donkey carts. In yet another incident, the investigation team, while investigating in Mengjiatun, discovered a large quantity of smuggled goods being escorted by two Koreans into the country. They proceeded to apprehend them. Outnumbered, the two Koreans fled. When the smuggled goods were passing by the Japanese consulate, the Japanese police attempted to detain the goods. After negotiations, they agreed to release them, but the customs authorities had to pay 50 yuan as the cost of escorting the two Koreans back to their country. On the same day, two Japanese men came to the customs station, claiming that one of the Koreans was their servant and that the customs officer had injured him, demanding compensation of several thousand yuan. The customs authorities refused. The Japanese men, out of shame and anger, attacked and injured a guard with an iron rake. In another incident, the Qinhuangdao Investigation Team intercepted five donkey carts loaded with sixty bags of smuggled sugar in Dangye. After escorting them to the customs station, a Japanese policeman and several followers came to the station, demanding their release. The customs officers had to comply due to force. In March of this year, two customs officers were attacked and injured by Koreans to the point of unconsciousness. One of them is still recuperating. Judging from the above incidents, the seriousness of the North China smuggling incident is indeed unprecedented in the history of Chinese customs. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Communications and Other Banks Handling Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Loans: A Total of More Than 2.23 Million Yuan. Loans to Tea Warehouses Have Been Recalled Batch by Batch. The First Batch of 1,000 Boxes of Black Tea Has Now Arrived in Shanghai.</h3>
<p>New Sound News Agency reports that the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Marketing Committee has handled loans for tea merchants, with Communications, Yumin, Anhui Local, and other banks lending a total of more than 2 million yuan. Previous loans to tea warehouses have been recovered batch by batch. After the establishment of the Marketing Headquarters, it handles the marketing of black tea. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Handling Goods Loans for Black Tea in Various Counties: The Anhui Provincial Local Bank, to handle the goods loans for black tea in Qimen, Zhide, and Wuliang counties, specifically borrowed 600,000 yuan from Cheng Zhenji, the manager of the bank, and Qi Yunqing, the general manager of the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, which has been successful. The local bank has now lent a total of 1,537,500 yuan to tea merchants in the three counties, with the Jiangxi Provincial Government and the Anhui Provincial Government each guaranteeing 10% of the total loan amount. As for the loans issued by the Qimen Black Tea Cooperative to tea merchants, the Communications Bank lent 320,000 yuan, the Anhui Bank lent 80,000 yuan, and the Jiangxi Yumin Bank handled loans for Raozhou black tea, totaling 300,000 yuan. The monthly interest rate for the above loans is 8 per cent.</p>
<p>Tea Warehouses Recover Black Tea Loans: After the foreign merchants' tea industry association formerly imposed control over Qimen black tea in Anhui Province and suspended exchange, the green tea part has now resumed acceptance. For the black tea part, Chen Yizhou, Hong Mengpan, and others from the association negotiated with Cheng Zhenji, the manager of the Shanghai Marketing Headquarters of the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Marketing Committee, and others to resolve the matter. It has now been decided that the director of the promotion team of the Marketing Headquarters will be assumed by a representative from the foreign merchants' tea industry (i.e., tea warehouses). The director of the team, Zheng Jianyuan, is the manager of Yuan Fengrun Tea Warehouse, a member of the foreign merchants' tea industry association. Detailed measures are still under discussion. As for the black tea loans previously issued by the various tea warehouses to the tea merchants in Anhui and Jiangxi provinces, they have been returned by the tea merchants one after another, with only a few remaining unpaid.</p>
<p>First Batch of Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Arrives in Shanghai: The manager of the sea transport headquarters is Cheng Zhenji, the deputy manager is Zeng Zhen, the director of the promotion team is Zheng Jianyuan, the director of the economic team is He Chongjie, and the director of the general affairs team is Lu Zhaomei. The first batch of 1,000 boxes, each weighing 60 catties, has been shipped from Anhui and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today. It will be sold by the promotion team of the Marketing Headquarters to various foreign firms for export. Currently, Mr. Cheng Zhenji, the manager of the headquarters, is very busy handling the marketing of black tea in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Consultations on Promotion Organization the Night Before: For promotional matters, Zheng Jianyuan will be in charge, nominated by the tea warehouses. As for the operating expenses of the office, it is stipulated that 5,000 yuan will be deducted from the commission of 20% of the tea sold. Everything is no problem, and the letter of appointment for the director of promotion has also been issued and is expected to take office within days. Unexpectedly, on the 11th of this month, Cheng Zhenji and Zeng Zhen of the Shanghai Management Office of the Association made a statement in the newspaper, announcing the detailed rules of the promotion team's office. The clauses contained therein were too restrictive, which once again caused misunderstandings among the tea warehouses and led to the involvement of black tea sales. Previous mutual understandings between the two sides have been virtually shelved. It is reported that Ling Shumo, Zeng Bangxi of the former Anhui Economic Committee, Qian Chengxu of the China Industrial Association, and others have visited tea merchants such as Hong Mengpan, chairman of the Foreign Tea Industry Association, and Chen Yizhou, manager of Zhongxinchang Tea Warehouse, successively to earnestly dredge the tea sales problem, advocating that under the current situation, the problem should be solved based on facts first to save the situation. At the same time, they urged the tea warehouses to be accommodating, and the tea warehouses' views are not entirely without basis in terms of facts and laws. After all, there have always been habits and practices in business matters. If the restrictions are too strict, not only will everything be hindered, but it is feared that the tea sales this year will not be good, and in the future, it will be criticized by all parties. Furthermore, according to the current understanding, the responsibility for promotion is entirely borne by the tea warehouses. How should they promote it to be reasonable? The power is entirely in the hands of the merchants. It does not seem that the committee can restrict it. According to the recent situation, the key to the problem seems to focus on whether there should be no regulations on the promotion organization. Therefore, people ask whether the Anhui-Jiangxi Marketing Committee can handle the matter with flexibility, and the day of resolution can be expected to be realized in the short term.</p>

<h3>Dredging Situation of Two Important Rivers</h3>
<p>The Zhao Jia River and the upstream waters of Chengchuan Sha, located between Gao Xing and Lu Xing districts of this city, flow westward through Dajiangpu and into the Huangpu River, making it one of the city's important rivers. However, it has been silted up for a long time, which has greatly affected farmland irrigation. Since the Chuansha County Government dredged a section of the upstream in the 23rd year [of the Republic], the section in this city, located downstream, urgently needed dredging. However, due to financial constraints, it was delayed several times. Finally, the Public Works Bureau, in the spring of this year, followed the usual method of requisitioning labor to dredge the river and established the Zhao Jia River Dredging Office to take charge. All the costs for water conservancy, dam construction, and office expenses were covered by the city government funds. The excavation of earthwork was assigned to each map along the river based on acreage, and those who could not provide labor could pay a substitute fee to the office to hire workers to do the work. It is now learned that the river has been dredged and completed, which is of great benefit to farmland irrigation. However, it is reported that the bureau, in order to maintain the depth of the river, has sent a letter to the Shipping Department of the Public Utilities Bureau to prohibit the operation of steamers.</p>
<p>Also, the Beixin Jing in the Pu Song district of western Shanghai is the hub connecting the Wusong River and the Puhui Pond. In the past, due to severe silting, the Public Works Bureau originally planned to dredge it together when dredging the Puhui Pond, but it did not materialize due to financial constraints. It is now being handled by adopting a small-scale labor method. All expenses and progress are the same as Zhao Jia River. However, because the conscripted personnel are not enthusiastic, it has not been completed yet.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Instructions on Stamping Methods for Factory Records, etc. - No Stamping Required If Not Used for Business</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance issued instructions on the method of affixing stamp tax, sending a telegram to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, stating that the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce had previously sent a substitute telegram in January, submitting eight types of sample booklets, such as diaries used by the Xinfeng Printing and Weaving Factory, for review. At that time, it was assumed that the submitted samples had not arrived for a long time, and it was asked if they were missing, and it was ordered to investigate and resubmit them. Now, the Chamber of Commerce has resubmitted sample booklets for factory affairs meeting minutes, factory affairs logs, group meeting minutes, work diary lectures, circular copies, correspondence archives, and reward and punishment records. Whether the booklets used by stores should be affixed with stamps should be determined based on whether they are used for business. Now, reviewing the factory affairs meeting minutes, group meeting minutes, lecture correspondence archives, circular copies, and reward and punishment records used by Xin Weaving Factory, all six types of booklets are not used for business, so they do not need to be affixed with stamps. One type of thin booklet, the factory affairs log, cannot be said to be not used for business based on the content recorded, and should still be handled according to the booklets used for business. As for the work diary, the factory should send this diary used in the twentieth year to the association for review before ordering compliance. It is appropriate to telegraph the association to immediately forward the instructions for compliance. Revenue Stamp of the Ministry of Finance.</p>

<h3>Philippine Overseas Chinese Inspection Group - Very Good Impressions from Beijing and Hangzhou - Government Seeks Education Level Improvement and Transportation Convenience for National Goods Development</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reported that the Philippine Overseas Chinese Return to China Inspection Group, a group of sixteen people led by the head Wang Quansheng, arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou at about 10 pm the night before. The reporter recently interviewed and asked about their impressions of this trip. According to them, after the group arrived in the capital, they immediately paid visits to the relevant authorities to report on the situation of the overseas Chinese. Among them, the group members Chen Zhonggang, Wu Zeto, Wu Yongdu, Huang Yongke, and other five people went directly to North China for sightseeing. The remaining sixteen people all went to Hangzhou via the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway and returned to Shanghai on the night of the 12th. Now they are going to Wuxi, Suzhou, and other places, which has not yet been decided. There are four impressions of this inspection: The factory business is progressing, and the development of national goods is rapid. When I was in the Philippines, I only knew about resisting foreign goods, but I didn't know that the development of national goods was so rapid, which is commendable. The progress in transportation, the development of highways, and the convenience of transportation. The improvement of education level. There are many universities in all the places I have been to. The government is working hard and the progress of various constructions is increasing day by day. After returning to the Philippines, the above points will be passed on to the overseas Chinese, which will surely arouse their deeper patriotic enthusiasm. At present, a group of members will take the Guangzhou ship to Xiamen on the 16th to return to their ancestral home in Fujian Province to visit relatives, and then return to the Philippines by different routes depending on the amount of business. The members who went to North China will not be able to come to Shanghai until the end of this month.</p>

<h3>Shanghai General Labor Union Requests Central Government to Amend Two Articles of the Labor Union Law - Workers' Freedom to Join and Withdraw from Unions Leads to Encouraging Reactionary Forces and Destroying Organizations</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai General Labor Union submitted a request to the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, and the Legislative Yuan to amend Articles 20 and 21 of the Labor Union Law. The original submission stated, "Request to amend Articles 20 and 21 of the Labor Union Law to benefit the labor movement and maintain the organization. The Chinese Kuomintang takes liberating the suffering of the people as its duty, and pays great attention to supporting the labor movement. The declarations and resolutions of the previous National Congresses all contain explanations on cultivating the labor movement, and the domestic policy outline clearly stipulates 'Formulating labor laws, improving the living conditions of workers, protecting labor organizations, and supporting their development.' This shows that our party attaches importance to labor organizations. How can we enable labor organizations to actively develop and fully complete their mission? It all depends on whether their own organization is sound. To seek a sound organization of labor organizations, in addition to passively eliminating harms that may hinder their existence, it is necessary to actively establish the status of labor organizations from a legislative perspective and prevent the destruction of bad elements. In other words, it is necessary to force all members to unite closely, and then the entire organization will have strength. However, the current Labor Union Law, Article 20, states that 'Labor unions may not force workers to join or prevent them from withdrawing,' and Article 21 of the same law states, 'Labor union members may withdraw from the labor union at any time, but if the labor union constitution stipulates a notice period, they must give prior notice.' According to the above-mentioned legal provisions, labor union members can freely choose to join or withdraw without any restraint, and the labor union has no right to interfere. In this way, it is impossible to seek a strict organization of labor unions, and it is even more likely to give reactionary forces a chance to destroy loyal unity. This kind of fact is often exemplified at present, and it is the only obstacle to the labor movement. Today, the national crisis is deepening, and the people need a sound organization more urgently than before, so that actions will not be chaotic in case of emergency. Therefore, the freedom of labor union members to join and withdraw should be restricted, which is necessary in fact. Moreover, there are many precedents in the labor legislation of various countries that stipulate mandatory membership for workers and restrictions on withdrawal. Its purpose is nothing more than to protect the development of legitimate organizations in order to seek the common welfare of members. Article 7 of our country's current Industry and Commerce Association Law also clearly stipulates that 'Companies and firms in the same industry should be members of the same industry association.' Recently, the Central Department of Civil Training also decided on sanctions for companies and firms that do not join the association or have joined the association but do not pay membership fees (see Central Department of Civil Training Public Letter No. 1575). Although the nature of the organization is one for the organization of employers and one for the organization of employees, their purpose of seeking common welfare for the same class is the same. Applying this example to that, the inapplicability of Articles 20 and 21 of the Labor Union Law to practical application is very obvious. Now, with the resolution of the Fourth Congress of this association, we request that Article 20 of the Labor Union Law be amended to 'All workers in the same industry or the same occupation organized by the labor union should join the labor union of each industry as members,' and Article 21 be amended to 'Labor union members may not arbitrarily withdraw from the labor union or fail to pay membership fees without legitimate reasons and approval from the labor union.' We are now submitting this document to your esteemed council, requesting your review and transfer to the Legislative Yuan for prompt amendment in order to benefit the labor movement and maintain the organization. We are anxiously awaiting your instructions."</p>
<h3>Disastrous Situation Severe - Sichuan Relief Association Sends Urgent Telegram for Relief - Chen Peide Visits Zhu Ziqiao to Discuss the Recent Situation of the Sichuan Disaster - More Than 20 Million Disaster Victims in 65 Counties</h3>
<p>Chen Peide, the secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Government and correspondent stationed in Shanghai, and the representative of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs to the National Children's Welfare Leaders Conference, received a telegram from Chengdu on the 9th from Mr. Yin Changling, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Relief Association, instructing him to report to Chairman Zhu Ziqiao on the severe situation of the Sichuan disaster and urge him to fly to Sichuan to inspect the relief efforts. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Urgent Telegram for Relief: The original letter stated, "The Central Government allocated 1 million yuan in public bonds, which only amounts to 620,000 yuan in cash. Distributing this to the 29 counties most severely affected is already insufficient. The 36 counties with secondary disasters, in addition to the ten or so counties with lighter disasters that can find their own solutions, still have twenty or so counties that must be relieved. However, the amount of money needed is also huge, and we can only distribute the previously borrowed money and the subsidies from the Department of Finance for public bonds as much as possible, which is very inadequate. I have urged you to come to Sichuan in a letter to Gongshu, and I have also sent an urgent telegram to Chairman Jiang, also urging you to come quickly. I dare to trouble you to inquire on my behalf," etc.</p>
<p>Visiting Zhu Ziqiao: After receiving the letter, Mr. Chen paid a visit to Chairman Zhu at the Shanghai office of the Relief Committee at 4 pm yesterday. Chairman Zhu was very concerned about the relief efforts in Sichuan Province and has sent people to take photos in various counties of Sichuan Province to complete on-the-spot investigations. He plans to go to Beijing within the week to vigorously apply to the Central Government and instructed Mr. Chen to convey this situation to the Sichuan Relief Association to comfort the people in the disaster area.</p>
<p>Real Situation of the Sichuan Disaster: After visiting Chairman Zhu, Mr. Chen published the real situation of the Sichuan disaster to the Shanghai News reporters as follows: "After the bandit disasters in Sichuan Province, there was a famine. Starving people blocked the roads, which is a catastrophe unprecedented in modern times. According to statistics from the Provincial Relief Association, the disaster-stricken area in the province is 65 counties (there are a total of 148 counties, three districts, and six bureaus in the whole province, and the disaster areas are mostly large counties), and the disaster-stricken area is 32,533,587 square kilometers (the area of the whole of Sichuan is 41,553,587 square kilometers), accounting for more than three-quarters of the total area of the province. The number of people affected by the disaster is more than 30 million (the total population of Sichuan is said to be 70 million, and there are no accurate statistics on the number of people who have died in wars and banditry over the years), accounting for more than half of the total population of the province. Even in wealthy areas, such as the Jiaojiao Field on the South Bank of Ba County (Chongqing), the 19 townships and towns in Jiangbei County (North Bank of Chongqing), and the various fields in the six districts of Luzhou County, there are also people fighting to eat 'white sturgeon mud' (commonly called Guanyin rice), and some have died as a result. Grass roots and tree bark have been dug up. In the third and fourth districts of Fuling, there are also people digging up this Guanyin mud, causing the rock feet to be hollowed out and crushing more than fifty people to death. Taking Fuling County alone, the number of disaster-stricken households has reached 49,443 households, and the disaster-stricken farmland has exceeded 9,811,856 mu, which is inevitable after three years of continuous drought. Also, in the second district of Nanjiang County alone, more than 2,000 famine victims have died within two months, and other districts have not yet been counted. In other places such as Langzhong, Cangxi, Beichuan, Xuanhan, Wanyuan, Zhaohua, Guangyuan, Dianjiang, Tianquan, Songpan, etc., there are even those who use only a broken pot with no rice to cook to exchange for poison and commit suicide with their entire family (according to the report of Hou Zongyao, the head of Pengju Township, Cangxi County), and there are those who commit suicide with their entire family for 200 wen (one cent in legal currency) (Sun Ershun, a porter in Rongchang County). The horrors of hell are unbearable to hear. According to the latest report from the special envoy of Songpan, the Provincial Relief Association, the cruelty from the Pingding Pass to Baicao Field, Suozi, Banbian Street, Wu Jialiang, Maming, Piankou to Huazi Ling is unbearable to describe. Moreover, the rice shortage is widespread in the southeast, with each dou rising to more than three yuan (in disaster areas such as Wanyuan, a dou of rice is as high as eight yuan, and it is extremely difficult to find), and famine victims from all over are forming teams to eat. In Shunqing alone, there are tens of thousands of people gathered, mostly from Tongnanba, looking like withered wood, and their condition is extremely miserable. At present, it is difficult to raise bandit forces in the north and south of eastern Sichuan, and it seems that the situation is more serious in several counties in northern Sichuan. In this situation, how can we sit idly by? If we do not plan to rescue them as soon as possible, what will the future be like? I will return to the province to work on the ground in the near future," he said.</p>
<h3>Yu Kaizhan Appointed - Government Representative for Directors and Supervisors of the Exchange Association</h3>
<p>Du Yong, the government representative for the directors and supervisors of the Shanghai Exchange Association, has repeatedly requested to resign, which has been approved by the Ministry of Commerce. Yu Kaizhan, a consultant, has been appointed as his successor.</p>
<h3>Public Concession to Encourage Inspection of Tuberculosis in Milk - All Milk Must Be Disinfected Starting in the Second Half of the Year</h3>
<p>Regarding the tuberculosis prevention movement in this port, it has recently been heard that the Public Concession Health Department intends to add tuberculosis inspection to the ordinary disinfection of milk sold in the Public Concession. Ordinary disinfection and tuberculosis inspection were originally two different things. Therefore, some milk farms have already voluntarily requested inspection, and the animals in their farms show no signs of tuberculosis infection, which can be said to be free of tuberculosis. However, in order to encourage milk farm owners to implement tuberculosis inspection, the concession health authorities intend to allow those who have passed the inspection to print "TT" on the bottle caps of "Grade A" milk for identification. However, this tuberculosis inspection is not intended to be forcibly implemented at present. However, those who voluntarily request inspection and regularly conduct health checks on the workers employed, etc., must be given some encouragement to promote it. In addition, ordinary disinfection procedures have been largely implemented in various milk farms, but they are not yet widespread. It is reported that disinfection will be uniformly implemented from July 1 this year, and then they will be allowed to sell it. Even milk that has passed the tuberculosis inspection must also comply with the procedure in order to ensure uniformity.</p>
<h3>Movie Star - Charlie Chaplin Passed Through Shanghai to Japan Yesterday</h3>
<p>The famous movie star Charlie Chaplin, accompanied by Ms. Paulette Goddard, recently traveled to Singapore and other places from Shanghai, and took a boat to the United States via Japan. He passed through Shanghai a few days ago, and held a banquet that night to entertain his Shanghai manager, Mr. Kreisel, and the French novelist Gao, who he met on the ship. Chaplin heard that his film "Modern Times" had been screened in Shanghai, with more than 72,000 viewers, and was very pleased. According to him, he is currently writing a film script with the East as the background. Since the decision to come to Shanghai, one-third of the script has been completed, totaling eight or nine thousand words. He plans to direct it himself, and Ms. Paulette Goddard will also appear on the screen. Mr. Chaplin, accompanied by Ms. Gao and his mother, took the original ship to Kobe yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Station Names Specified for the Sujia Railway - A Total of Six Stations Set Up in the Middle, Submitted to the Ministry for Approval</h3>
<p>The Sujia Railway, built by the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau, has recently been completed and will be open to traffic soon. In addition to the starting station Suzhou Station and the terminal station Jiaxing Station, the railway has a total of six stations in the middle. All station names have been investigated and proposed, and submitted to the Ministry for approval. The excerpts are as follows: 1. Xiangmen Station, located in Wuxian County. In the Spring and Autumn Period, it was simply called Jiangmen, which later changed to Xiangdou. The city gate was blocked in the Sui Dynasty. When the Sujia Railway was first built, it was discussed with the Wuxian County Government to reopen Xiangmen to facilitate transportation. A station was set up outside it, so the station was named Xiangmen. 2. Wujiang Station, located in Wujiang County. The name has not changed from the Ming Dynasty to the present. The railway station is located in the northeast corner outside the county seat, so it is named Wujiang Station. 3. Bachai Station is an important town in Wujiang County. The Moklu station is located on the west side of the canal, facing the town, so the station is named Bachai. 4. Pingwang Station, Pingwang Town is located on the main road of Jiahuzhou, and the shops are filled with goods and abundant grain. The railway station is located close to the west of the town, so the town's name is used as the station name. 5. Shengze Station, this town has been famous for cotton and silk weaving since ancient times, and merchants gather from far and near. Modern Shengfang is famous at home and abroad. The railway station is set up according to the town, so it is named Shengze Station. 6. Wangjiang Jing Station, Wangjiang Jing is well-known, and the town is located on the east side of the canal. The railway station is located on the west side of the canal, and there is a Hongqiao Bridge over the Changhe River for access, so the station name is determined to be Wangjiang Jing Station.</p>
<h3>Tangshan Qixin Porcelain - Applicable to the Special Price for Combined Transport of Coarse Porcelain - The Railway Bureau Will Conduct a One-Year Trial, Starting on June 1</h3>
<p>The products of Tangshan Qixin Porcelain Factory used to be shipped to Shanghai by ship from Qinhuangdao. Now, in order to facilitate transportation, the factory plans to change to combined railway transport to Beijing, Shanghai and other places. However, the railway freight is higher, and the factory cannot afford it. It has sent a letter to the Jinpu Railway, requesting a reduction to avoid affecting costs. The Jinpu Railway believes that this porcelain is indeed a large-volume transport, and it is self-inviting, so it has agreed on three methods: 1. For all whole-car porcelain from the factory that is transported to various stations between Beijing and Shanghai, the freight for this road (Jinpu Road) section should be collected at 80% of the fifth-class ordinary freight rate of 800 kilometers, and a letter should be sent to the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, requesting that the freight for this road section be calculated at 85% of the fifth-class ordinary freight rate based on the actual kilometers (the Beining Railway has already set a special price for this porcelain at 56% of the fifth-class freight rate). 2. This transport is still applicable to the combined transport's method of decreasing over distance. 3. The aforementioned price reduction method will be provisionally tried for one year, and whether to continue it will be determined after assessing the results at that time. After inquiring and the two roads agreed, the road, in addition to replying to the bureau, expressing its agreement, submitted it to the Ministry for review and approval. Now, Ministry Order 4242 has been received, approving a one-year trial as a special price for combined transport of coarse porcelain, openly applicable. The transport area is limited to the transport from Tangshan, Wahei, Kaiping, and Guye stations of the Beining Road to various stations between Beijing and Shanghai. It is scheduled to be implemented from June 1 this year.</p>
<h3>Ningbo People - Planning to Build a Bronze Statue for Yu Qiaqing</h3>
<p>Shen Wenzhi, Weng Shanlu, and other Ningbo gentry in Shanghai believe that Yu Qiaqing has spared no effort in serving the community, and has vigorously promoted public welfare in Sanbei, building a gate on the Lunbu Pier on the Longshan Coast, connecting automobiles on the Yin-Zhen Ci Road, and also setting up schools, developing water conservancy, and benefiting the local area. Recently, he also created an inland port Lunbu Pier on the banks of the Dajia River in Zhenhai, hoping to achieve the purpose of duty-free. It has already been seen in practice, costing more than two million yuan. In order to permanently commemorate Mr. Yu, it is planned to build a bronze statue in Longshan to show admiration. Yesterday, a special letter was sent to various Ningbo compatriots and people from all walks of life to solicit participation in the initiation. For the convenience of the process, a preparatory office was set up in Zhenbei.</p>
<h3>Central Savings Association - Second Lottery to Be Held Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Since the Central Savings Association opened last month, its business has been extremely developed due to the various preferential features of the regulations set for depositors. Every day, tens of thousands of people flock to the association to save money. Recently, as branches have been successively established in various places in the interior, new depositors have become more enthusiastic. It is learned that the association will hold a lottery in public at the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 2 pm tomorrow, with a special prize of 25,000 yuan. The association will guarantee and pay the amount in full according to the method of the first period. Because each association proposes half a yuan as the standard for calculating the special prize, it must satisfy 50,000 numbers to have 25,000 yuan. Now, in order to give preferential treatment to depositors, the association still issues 25,000 yuan when the number is less than 50,000, and gradually increases to 50,000 yuan after exceeding 50,000 numbers. Therefore, general depositors take advantage of this special opportunity to rush to join, because when the number is not large, this special prize is easy to win. In addition to the special prize, there is also a first prize of 2,000 yuan, a second prize of 200 yuan, a third prize of 200 yuan, and a fourth prize of 100 yuan for every 2,000 numbers, each with one prize. There are also four additional prizes. In addition, there must be a last prize of 12 yuan in every ten numbers, so there are many opportunities for depositors to win prizes. When the principal is returned, the bonus issued by the association is accumulated at compound interest, and the bonus not issued when withdrawing from the association in the middle is also included in the interest. Therefore, all depositors rush to join the association. Because the lottery is imminent, depositors are crowded and cannot fill in the association form. They temporarily issue a temporary receipt with the number so that it can be included in this month's lottery. It is heard that it is still possible to join the association before 11 am tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Madame Martin's Lecture Yesterday on Birth Control Methods at the New Location of the Shanghai Birth Control Guidance Center</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, British birth control expert Madame Martin, after arriving in Shanghai from Hong Kong last month, delivered successive lectures on "Population Problems and Birth Control" and "Women's Participation in Politics," attracting considerable social attention. Recently, she returned from travels in the capital and the Tianjin-Hebei area and gave her third lecture yesterday at 2:00 PM at the new location of the Shanghai Birth Control Guidance Center, affiliated with the Chinese Women's Birth Control Association at 40 Rue Tenant. Her topic was "Birth Control Methods." Madame Martin first introduced the guidance center, saying that from now on, every Wednesday from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, specialized doctors would be present to provide free guidance on various birth control methods that do not harm physiology.</p>
<p>Reasons: She detailed the purpose of birth control, not to prohibit childbirth, but to allow mothers to rest for two years after childbirth, up to the number of children they can support and educate. Therefore, parents can come to the guidance center for guidance immediately after the birth of their first child. If they want a second child after eighteen months, they can allow it to be born without hindrance. This will greatly benefit not only family finances and physical health but also the country and society, reducing the number of poor children adrift without support. The street children in Shanghai are rife because parents who cannot afford to raise their children do not know how to control childbirth. If a mother's health is not good, or if she suffers from lung, liver, or heart disease, she should rest for three years after childbirth until she recovers. If she has a difficult birth requiring surgery, a maximum of two births is advised; otherwise, it will endanger the mother's body. All this requires attention to the implementation of birth control methods (the church's advocacy of separate residence for couples is opposed by us). Methods: There are many ways to limit childbirth. Natural methods include famine, disease, infanticide, abortion, and war. However, what we seek is scientific birth control. At this point in her lecture, Madame Martin displayed a diagram of a woman's reproductive organs made of rubber in a black square box, explaining that when a fetus is formed, a man's sperm must pass through the cervix and unite with a woman's egg to form it. The scientific birth control method is to prevent the union of sperm and egg. She then showed a cervical cap made of strong rubber, explaining that it is used as a barrier between sperm and egg. She explained it in great detail, but said that because of differences in the internal structure of women's reproductive organs, those who want to use it should first go to the guidance center for a doctor's examination and then choose a cervical cap of the appropriate size. Madame Martin then introduced another method: a square rubber sponge that is first soaked in warm water and then lightly sprinkled on both sides with Form Powder (a soapy medicinal powder containing starch and acid) produced by Philip Stoughton Pharmacy in New York and lightly rubbed to produce foam, which is then used to block the cervix. The annual cost of these two items is only one or two yuan. Madame Martin believes this is a perfect scientific contraceptive method. However, this medicinal powder is not yet sold in Shanghai and has been ordered from the New York pharmacy by the Birth Control Guidance Center. In addition, there is a common "empty tube" method. Although Madame Martin introduced it, she did not praise it, only saying that it should be used if a man suffers from venereal disease.</p>
<h3>Special Second Court Summoned Yesterday Regarding Gu Zhuxuan's Smoking Case, Gu Still Denies, Court Ordered Expert Assessment</h3>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, owner of the former Tianchan Theater, was sentenced to fifteen years in prison and ten years of deprivation of civil rights by the Special Second Court for inciting the assassination of Tang Jiapeng. He appealed the original judgment to the Higher Third Branch Court. After the conclusion of the arguments, it was discovered that Gu had bribed guards to incite the original accuser, Zhao Guangfu, Zhang Xiaosizi, and others to recant in an attempt to evade guilt. While the Higher Court sent the case to the Special Second Court Procuratorate for investigation, fellow prisoners Li Heshang and Guo Shanyu accused Gu Zhuxuan of bribing the warden Jia Furong and Wu Lu to shield him while he smoked opium and inhaled heroin in Guangci Hospital. The Special Second Procuratorate has already arrested Warden Jia and Wu for investigation and filed a public prosecution with the Criminal Court, which sentenced Jia and Wu to five years in prison each. Regarding Gu Zhuxuan's opium smoking, yesterday afternoon at 3:30, the police department dispatched Chinese and French police officers to Guangci Hospital to bring Gu before Judge Sun Pengxian in the Eighth Criminal Court for interrogation. After asking Gu's age and place of origin, the police department representative, lawyer Yuan Jiahuan, presented the case, stating that the defendant Gu Zhuxuan smoked opium while detained in Guangci Hospital, according to accusations by other prisoners. The prosecution was brought under Article 262 of the Criminal Law regarding opium offenses, requesting that he be interrogated according to the law. In court, Gu was asked, "Did you smoke opium in the hospital ward?" Gu replied, "No. The room I'm detained in is very small, how could I smoke?" He was asked, "Do you know that the two wardens have already been punished for your smoking?" Gu replied, "I know about that, but I really didn't smoke." He was asked, "Do you know prisoners Li Heshang and Guo Shanyu? They accused you of smoking." Gu replied, "Those two wanted to extort money from me. They kept asking me for money and arguing, so the doctor ordered them to be sent to the same prison. I arrived on August 15th, and there were always two Annamese, three detectives, and guards watching me, so how could I smoke? Besides, the regulations state that anyone caught smoking cigarettes will be handcuffed for eight hours, so how would I dare to violate them?" He was asked, "Do you know another prisoner, Wang A'er? The opium dregs he stole were what you smoked." Gu replied, "He was digging a tunnel to escape, it was another small room, not where I lived. I didn't go to that room either." At this point in the interrogation, the judge said that he would have Gu examined, review the case files, and bring in witnesses for further questioning, and then adjourned the hearing, scheduling another interrogation at a later date. Gu was taken back to the detention center by the police officers.</p>
<h3>New Life Movement Inspection Team Disputes During Duty Enforcement, Rectifying Oneself Before Rectifying Others, Clash Between Apprentice and Police Officer</h3>
<p>Yang Jiazhen, an apprentice from Hengde Tang Pharmacy on the border of Zhabei at the intersection of Chang'an Road and Hanzhong Road, was carrying a child from the shop to buy white sugar from a southern goods store across the road at 5:30 PM the day before yesterday. At that time, six members of the New Life Movement inspection team from the Hengfeng Road Police Station passed by and, seeing that Yang's coat buttons were not fastened, immediately stepped forward to correct him. After Yang fastened them, he noticed that the uniform of one of the officers had a torn right arm. Yang immediately said that the New Life Movement should rectify oneself before rectifying others, and that the officer's uniform should be sewn first. The officer, angered by Yang's criticism, punched him in the face, and the police officers surrounded and beat him. This led to an argument, and two officers, numbered 1972 and 1974, tore off their police caps and shoulder patches, falsely accusing Yang of obstructing official duties. The station chief, Lu Pei, presented Yang to the Public Security Bureau. After investigation by staff member Xie, it was determined that police officer Jiang Hualou, numbered 197, had indeed falsely accused a pedestrian. A public statement was issued to the Public Security Bureau by the shop, so the police officer was detained and transferred to the court for investigation. The court investigated what patrol officer had led the team at the time and how the station chief, Lu Pei, explained the situation, and determined that these matters should be thoroughly investigated. Therefore, yesterday, a summons was issued for investigation. Only one patrol officer, surnamed He, arrived. Prosecutor Li ordered him to post bail and ordered him to reach a settlement with the plaintiff within three days.</p>
<h3>Argument Over a White Tile Leads to Tragic Murder, Chen Hougui Dies from Injuries, Bao Liangxiao Arrested and Sent to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The upper floor of No. 604 Avenue Edward VII is the residence of a so-called "Third Sister," which is used exclusively for gambling by lower-class individuals. On March 29th of this year, at 6:00 PM, a fight broke out in the house. By the time the police arrived, the fighters had all fled. Only two people were found with knife wounds, one named Chen Hougui, who was seriously injured, and one named Wang Renhai, whose injuries were minor. Detectives from the Old Gate Police Station sent the injured to the hospital for treatment. Chen died on the 31st. An investigation was conducted. It was discovered that Chen Hougui was from Danyang and worked at a printing press on North Henan Road. He had been laid off last year. The perpetrator was Dou Liangqing (also known as "Little Chatterbox"), a colleague of Chen's, also from Danyang. The incident was the result of gambling. Police officers went to Dou's home at No. 18 Haikou Road to arrest him, but he was not found. A wanted warrant was issued by the First Special District Court for his strict arrest. Recently, the Old Gate Police Station received a notice from the Danyang Public Security Bureau stating that Dou had been arrested by the bureau and requesting that someone be sent to bring him in. Chief Detective Lu Gengsheng and detectives Chen Shanji and Chen Ruisheng went and brought Dou to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the case, charging him with intentional injury resulting in death under Article 277, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, and stated that further investigation was needed, requesting an extension. Subsequently, Wang Renhai surrendered, testifying that Dou was one of the people who wielded the knife at the time. Under interrogation, Dou Liangqing confessed that at the end of January of this year, he was gambling with the deceased's brother, Chen Mingguig and others, in room 308 of the Tianran Hotel. He claimed that the conflict arose because he played a "white tile," and on that day, Chen and others gathered many people to attack him at No. 604 Avenue Edward VII. He said that he turned off the lights and hid under the table, and he did not know how the deceased was injured. Criminal Court Judge Qian Hongye reviewed the confession and ordered a postponement of the hearing for one week.</p>
<h3>Fish Market Opens Special Ferry Service, From Xiaodongmen to the Market to Benefit Fish Merchants, Free Transportation of Fish Cargo to Facilitate Transactions</h3>
<p>Since its opening on the 12th, the Shanghai Fish Market of the Ministry of Industry has seen a continuous stream of wheeled transport from Dinghai Island, and it has been quite prosperous. The turnover of the market yesterday morning was more than 10,000 yuan. Because river fish are currently in short supply, and the season for large yellow croaker ice fish has not yet started, transactions are not very active. The market is paying close attention to water transportation to facilitate the movement of fish merchants. In addition to arranging for municipal ferries to stop, it has also opened a ferry service from the pier in the Xiaodongmen fishmonger gathering area to the fish market. The ferry runs from Xiaodongmen to the fish market twice every night (i.e., early morning) at 2:00 and 2:30, and from the fish market to Xiaodongmen twice every morning at 5:00 and 5:30. Fish market transactions all take place late at night and early in the morning, so the ferry service is very convenient for fish merchants. In addition, to give preferential treatment to fish merchants and fishermen, the fish market provides free transportation for fish cargo from the shore to the market for transactions, without charging a penny, but only for one week. At the same time, all fish cargo arriving at the market for the first time will be given three days of free ice, with no refrigeration fees, and only a handling fee of one yuan per ton.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Fellow Association Rescues Yang Wendao</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Fellow Association in Shanghai held its 16th executive board meeting yesterday. Attendees included Tang Haian, Guo Shun, Guo Zhongliang, Li Dachao, Chen Fengyuan, Chen Qifen, Li Ze, and others. Tang Haian was the chairman, and Jiang Tianduo recorded the minutes. After the chairman announced the opening of the meeting, in addition to reporting and discussing various cases, the association also addressed the case of fellow villager Yang Wendao and others, who were suspected of involvement in the murder of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo last year. Since their detention by the Public Concession police, the association has submitted separate requests to the municipal government and letters to the court police, requesting a thorough investigation of the truth to avoid harming the innocent. After the court conducted two preliminary hearings, much new evidence was discovered, all of which was sufficient to prove that Yang Wendao was indeed wronged. Zheng Pingshan, Zeng Yuan, Zhang Caiyuan, and others, greedy for rewards, used despicable means to implicate him. In order to uphold humanity and justice, every effort should be made to provide relief. Therefore, it was resolved to: Unite with groups from all walks of life to organize a Yang case support association, advocate for fairness, and jointly seek rescue; Issue a declaration, announcing the true facts and appealing to public judgment; Submit a request to the municipal government to determine the truth and falsehood of the facts and provide effective relief; Send letters to the Municipal Council and the Chinese Ratepayers Association, urging them to pay attention to the true facts of the case and provide humanitarian relief; Send a letter to the court, urging it to determine the truth and falsehood of the facts and provide legal relief to avoid the innocent being victimized by a scam.</p>
<h3>Bullet Hits Chest, Watch Shatters but Person Unharmed, Yang Xiaoqi Narrowly Escapes Death</h3>
<p>Yang Xiaoqi, from Ningbo, and his wife, Ms. Yao, traveled together from Ningbo to Shanghai by boat the day before yesterday, intending to transfer to Nantong to visit his wife's family. After arriving yesterday, they went to the City God Temple to sightsee and buy things. As they were walking near Fangbang Road and Guangji Road, three robbers suddenly jumped out from the side of the road, brandishing guns and ordering them to be silent. They robbed Ms. Yao of a gold-plated bracelet worth more than forty yuan from her arm and were about to flee with their loot when Yang bravely stepped forward and grabbed one of the robbers holding the gun. In desperation, the robber turned around and fired a shot at Yang's chest. Coincidentally, the bullet struck Yang's pocket watch, which he carried at his chest, shattering the watch completely. Yang was only grazed on the skin. The three robbers took the opportunity to escape without a trace. After hearing about the incident, the City God Temple police station ordered a large number of police officers to the scene and reported the incident to headquarters for investigation.</p>
<h3>Woman Attempts Suicide with Daughter, Found Innocent</h3>
<p>Wen Jian, a Cantonese woman residing at 121 Tiantong Road, had a three-year-old daughter named Meimei. Her husband, Wen Ren, worked as a stoker on a British ship. Last spring, he wrote to her, saying that he had other matters in England and could not return home, but that expenses would be sent home on time. However, since January of this year, contact was lost, and no money was sent. Ms. Wen gradually became impoverished and found it difficult to make a living. She owed several months' rent and was unable to pay it. Thinking about the long road ahead and how to survive, she suddenly had a desperate idea. On the morning of the 8th of this month, at 11:00 AM, she poured a small box of leftover opium dregs from her late great uncle into tea and drank it with her daughter. After the poison took effect, they were sent to Shanghai Nursing Home Hospital for treatment. The Hongkou Police Station was notified and took Ms. Wen and her daughter into custody, charging her with attempted murder and sending her to the Special District Court for interrogation and detention. All these details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao presided over the trial. Wen Jian was found innocent of attempting suicide with her daughter. The daughter, Wen Meimei (who was being cared for at the Women and Children's Relief Association), was allowed to be taken back by her mother, and Ms. Wen was admonished not to commit suicide again in the future.</p>
<h3>Xue Zhenyi Withdraws Lawsuit Against Zhao Guangfu, Zhao Says He Doesn't Understand Writing, Otherwise He Would Also Sue Xue</h3>
<p>Xue Zhenyi, from Tongshan County, Xuzhou, was arrested in April 1933 for opening fire in the French Concession in an attempt to kill Hai Zongqi, a resident of Beiping, and was sentenced to seven years in prison by the Special Second Court. During his imprisonment in the Special Second Prison, in connection with Gu Zhuxuan, the owner of Tianchan Theater, inciting the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, the original accuser, Zhao Guangfu, testified during Gu's appeal hearing in the Higher Third Branch Court that the purpose of accusing Gu Zhuxuan was to extort money, and that the plan was devised and the documents were written by fellow prisoners Xue Zhenyi and Zhu Jincheng. Now that Xue has been paroled, he believes that Zhao's testimony was deliberately disruptive and slanderous, so he hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Special Second Court, accusing Zhao Guangfu of obstruction and requesting an investigation, and also attaching a civil suit. The case has been investigated by Jones, and all the details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday was the date for the continued hearing. After Judge Chen Pusheng arrived in court, he ordered the defendant Zhao Guangfu to be brought in and summoned guard Zhang Ximin from the detention center to testify. The plaintiff Xue Zhenyi and his lawyer arrived in court. The court first asked Zhao Guangfu when he met Xue Zhenyi. Zhao replied, "After the first trial of my case." The court asked, "When was your case decided by the Supreme Court?" Zhao replied, "In December 1934." The court asked, "During the Gu case trial, did you say that Xue Zhenyi and Zhu Jincheng planned to extort Gu Zhuxuan?" Zhao replied, "I said a lot of things, but I've forgotten them all now. I can't remember." The court asked, "Why did you say Xue was a great lawyer?" Zhao replied, "Xue used to pull rickshaws. Later, he carried briefcases for lawyers. After the Shanghai war broke out, he joined the Red Cross and made a lot of money. Because the money wasn't divided evenly, he wanted to shoot Hai Zongqi. After Wang Xinggao was arrested, Xue said to me that we could use this opportunity to extort money, so Xue and others made the plan." The court asked, "What was Xue's intention in the Gu case?" Zhao replied, "On one hand, he acted like a good guy and mediated. On the other hand, he got money and distributed it. Xue also wanted me to buy him a suit worth more than a hundred yuan, but unfortunately, it didn't work out. When I withdrew my appeal, Xue wrote the document for me. The Higher Third Court was scared when they saw the document he wrote, so everyone in prison called Xue the Chief of General Staff and the Military Advisor, and even called him the Shui Muting Great Lawyer, but he just couldn't appear in court to defend me." The judge, based on the testimony, said to Xue, "Zhao Guangfu has already been sentenced to life imprisonment. There's no point in you accusing him." Xue replied, "Since the court has interrogated everything clearly, I don't want Zhao to be further punished. I am willing to withdraw the lawsuit." At this point, Zhao Guangfu said, "Because I am illiterate and don't understand writing, I am helpless. If I had the same abilities as Xue, I would accuse him of false accusation. Please arrest him, or at least order him to post bail." The court, based on the testimony, ruled in court that the lawsuit was not accepted and the attached civil suit was dismissed.</p>
<h3>Higher Court Sends Representatives to Shanghai to Investigate the Local Court Gun Theft Case, Radio Found on the Empty Field of Datong University, Court Sends Police Chief to Inspect and Confirms it is Stolen Goods</h3>
<p>The theft of twenty handguns, ammunition, and a radio from the Shanghai Local Court's evidence room has been reported in previous issues of this newspaper. It was discovered yesterday morning by Du Erlang, a caretaker at Datong University behind the South Railway Station, while sweeping the school's empty field. He found a radio, and upon inspection, all the light bulbs, magnets, and parts were missing, leaving only an empty shell. An investigation into how it got there revealed that the empty field was inside the wall, and the wire mesh on the wall was broken, indicating that it had been thrown in. After asking around, no one had lost it. The school immediately reported the incident, recalling that the newspaper had reported the theft of a radio and other items from the court, and that the school had recently lost five boxes of clothing, suspecting it was the work of the same thieves. The school immediately reported the incident to the local police station, which sent the radio shell to the Ximen Branch. After notifying the Local Court by telephone, Police Chief Zhang Shuping was dispatched to the Ximen Branch to investigate. It was confirmed that it was the original stolen item from the court, and he went to Datong University to investigate. He reported back to President Luo and the Chief Prosecutor, relying on the clues to investigate and ensure the case was solved. At the same time, after receiving the report, Zhu, the President of the Jiangsu Higher Court, dispatched Wu Yuheng, a judge from the Criminal Third Court of the Higher Court, and Prosecutor Zhang Yaoyuan to Shanghai in the same car yesterday morning to investigate. They went to the Local Court to meet with President Luo. President Luo accompanied the chief clerk, Yin Wenlian, to inspect the evidence room for a long time, and President Luo explained the details of the theft. After inspecting the scene, Judge Wu has returned to Jiangsu to report his findings.</p>

<h3>Two Robbers Who Stole Police Weapons in Zhabei Arrested, Three Previously Arrested Were Not the Real Culprits, Confession Made After Xu Xueqin's Arrest</h3>
<p>Liang Yu and Chu Jingwu, the leaders of the First Detachment of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's Detective Corps, received a tip that the real culprits behind the robbery of firearms from police officers on Xibaoxing Road, under the jurisdiction of the Zhabei North Station Branch, and on Gonghe Xin Road, under the jurisdiction of the Xin Zha Branch, were Xu Xueqin, Cui Xiaoguizi, and others. The three people arrested by the Ximen Branch were not the real culprits but were framed. Now Xu and his accomplices knew that</p>
<p>the case was serious</p>
<p>and could not stay in Shanghai for long, so they planned to flee to other cities and had decided to leave tonight (i.e., the night before last). Liang and Chu, after receiving the report, immediately led their deputies to monitor a certain location on Huangjia Que Road. Around midnight, they saw Xu leaving a certain Li's house (i.e., the house of Li Xiaobao, the leader of the Ximen Detective Squad) and traveling by rickshaw with Li toward the wharf. At this time,</p>
<p>the informant</p>
<p>identified him. Liang and his deputies stepped forward and arrested Xu. After being taken back to headquarters and interrogated, Xu confessed that his name was Xu Xueqin and admitted to robbing the firearms from police officers at the intersection of Xibaoxing Road and Tiantong'an Road, under the jurisdiction of the Zhabei North Station Branch, and at the intersection of Gonghe Xin Road and Taiyang Temple Road, under the jurisdiction of the Xin Zha Branch. After the robbery, the firearms were initially hidden in Jiangwan. Later, my mentor, named Lu Jinchun, told me to</p>
<p>hand over the firearms</p>
<p>and take them to the Ximen Detective Squad for safekeeping. After a few days, my mentor and Chief Li discussed that because the case was serious, it had to be solved. So, they found the three people, surnamed Liu, who have now been arrested, by tricking them into going to a certain location on Dapu Road to commit a crime. The firearms were supplied by my mentor and others. Then my mentor and one surnamed Yang, and a Ximen</p>
<p>Detective Squad</p>
<p>tea server and I took the firearms (i.e., the firearms robbed from the police officers). At the same time, detective Jin Yushan (i.e., Chief Li Xiaobao's disciple) and two others secretly followed behind and ambushed on both sides of the location. After we handed over the firearms to them, they were immediately arrested. So, the three people arrested earlier were not the real culprits but were framed. Today, because I was</p>
<p>going to another city</p>
<p>, I went to Chief Li's place to borrow some travel expenses. He was seeing me off to the ship when I was arrested. My accomplices, Cui Xiaoguizi, Lu Jinchun, and others, are currently in a certain location on Gonghe Xin Road in Zhabei. After verifying the confession, the team, together with police officers dispatched from the Xin Zha Branch, went to Gonghe Xin Road and other locations around 4:00 AM the next morning and arrested Lu Jinchun, Madam Lu Song, Madam Wang Qiu, Cui Xiaoguizi, and others and brought them back to the case. After clarifying the situation, they were sent to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau yesterday. It is also rumored that the leader of the Ximen Detective Squad has fled.</p>
<h3>Car Plunges into River, Three Bodies Retrieved for Autopsy, Relatives Claim Bodies for Burial After Autopsy</h3>
<p>At 3:00 AM the morning before last, a car with the license plate number Friendship 6835, carrying a driver and seven employees from a fish market, was driving along Liping Road in Yangshupu when the car suddenly plunged into the river. Because it was late at night, all the occupants drowned. Patrol officers from the Yangshupu Police Station later found the car and retrieved three bodies from the harbor. The details have been read in the newspapers. The three corpses were identified as Ye Zhiping (27 years old, from Jiashan), Hu Jinglian (40 years old, from Pudong), and Gu Changshu (30 years old, from Pudong). The police station sent the three corpses to the hospital for medical examination. Having determined they had already died, they were transferred to the autposy room on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, Song Genshan, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, arrived at the room to conduct an autopsy, confirming that the corpses were real. He ruled that the three corpses of the deceased Ye Zhiping, Hu Jinglian, and Gu Changshu had all died by drowning. Ye's body was handed over to Gu Xuegen, Hu's body was handed over to his son Hu Shude, and Gu's body was handed over to his mother, Madam Gu Yuan, who signed acknowledgments to take them back for burial.</p>
<h3>Hong Jixing: Fishing Boat Finds Fortune Amidst Misfortune – Loses Two Nets but Saves Three, Helping with Fishing and Returns Fully Loaded</h3>
<p>About twenty spring fishing boats from the second district of Wusong arrive daily. Although the number of boats is not large, the fish catch is indeed plentiful. This is due to the abundance of yellow croaker in the northern seas, allowing each fishing boat to return fully loaded. Among them, there is a large sand boat named Hong Jixing, sold through the Cui Sheng Fish Firm from Xuzhou. It caught six large boats of fish. According to the fish firm's sales, it is estimated to be around 900 *chou* (a unit of measure), totaling more than 5,000 silver dollars. This massive sum, a windfall from the sea, sets an unprecedented new record. It is said that there is a story behind the boat's huge catch, worth recording. According to reports, the sand boat set out with three *gang* (nets), two new and one old. When fishing, the new nets were first cast to catch spring fish. Because of the surge in fish, the nets quickly filled and could not be lifted. In desperation, the captain ordered the crew to cut the ropes, abandoning the nets to prevent greater danger. After one net was abandoned, the second net filled again, forcing another cut. In this way, two new nets were completely lost. At this point, the crew was extremely distressed and worried. Suddenly, they spotted three people in distress near the boat. Zhang Peiheng, a senior member of the Hong boat crew, quickly ordered the crew to rescue them. Upon inquiry, the three said they were crew members of the Yan Dexing fishing boat, which had capsized in a hurricane and giant waves. All twelve crew members had fallen into the water. The three rescued were named Wang Shaogui, Wang Tonghua, and Wang Xiaoer. The other nine were reportedly rescued by other boats. After being rescued, the three learned of the Hong boat's situation with the nets. Grateful for being saved, they volunteered to teach the Hong boat crew how to set nets, using their own experience. They also worked wholeheartedly to help with fishing, enabling the Hong boat to return fully loaded. Therefore, people say they found fortune amidst misfortune, and that good deeds are rewarded, which is undoubtedly true. The boat now plans to send Wang Shaogui and the others back to their hometown.</p>
<h3>The Situation of Shanghai Maids' Emancipation</h3>
<p>Since the government announced the prohibition of keeping maids, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau has issued notices requiring maid-owning families to register within a deadline. It also sent letters to the Chinese Child Welfare Association, requesting practical assistance and determined implementation. Yesterday, the reporter visited Zhao Jian, a protection officer of the Chinese Child Welfare Association, to inquire about the recent situation of maid emancipation in Shanghai. According to Mr. Zhao, the emancipation of maids is not easy. The deadline, from March 1st to the end of August, has already passed for two months, but very few have registered. After the association investigates cases of maid abuse with evidence, they still try every means to deny it and are unwilling to hand them over easily. For example, the family of Huang Lansheng, residing at No. 67, Washington Lane, Qiujiang Road, keeps a maid named Wang Guixiang, a nine-year-old from Ningbo, who is severely abused by her master. After the association investigated, it reported to the North Sichuan Road Police Station, which took the girl to the station for questioning. After various investigations, it was confirmed that she was a maid. However, Huang Lansheng's mother-in-law falsely claimed that she was her niece, orphaned by her deceased mother, entrusted to their care. Speaking of it, it was actually like the ancient people of today, and no one dared to criticize. Looking at the girl again, she was dressed in rags, her hands and feet covered in calluses, which was very pitiful. After the Public Security Bureau repeatedly ordered, she was finally emancipated. Another example is Zhuo Chen, a Cantonese woman residing at No. 6, Wuxianfang, Baoan Road, who abused Zhuo Xiulian, a thirteen-year-old maid. The association reported to the Linping Road Police Station, which took Zhuo Xiulian to the station for questioning and sent her to Guangren Hospital for examination. It was confirmed that there were slight injuries, and the case was sent to the Public Security Bureau for investigation that day. Furthermore, the association sent people to investigate the neighbors on both sides of the family, who signed statements saying that the maid was often beaten and scolded, and sometimes driven out late at night, forcing her to sleep outdoors, confirming the abuse. Zhuo Chen claimed that the girl was adopted as her daughter when she was three years old and refused to release her. There are too many examples to list. They all say that they were entrusted by close friends or relatives, or fostered by relatives. According to this situation, haven't all maid-owners become charitable benefactors? According to this situation, it is still difficult to predict whether satisfactory results can be achieved in the future. It is said that keeping maids was originally a remnant of feudal society, not only violating humanity, but also, purely in terms of human interests, it is not very beneficial at all. If people are wise, they dare to advise those who have maids to register them quickly.</p>
<h3>Dismissed Chinese Constable Remains Unrepentant for Evil Deeds – Arrested for Assembling a Crowd to Commit Assault</h3>
<p>Sheng Qichang, residing at No. 8, Panshan Road, a native of the city, served as Chinese constable No. 2908 two years ago. After being dismissed for some reason, he did not behave himself and liked to fight with people. On the afternoon of the 29th of last month, at 6 pm, he assembled a gang in Yangshupu and beat up his fellow villager Li Axiang, injuring his buttocks and breaking half of his teeth, who was sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. The injury was slight. Later, he was summoned to the Special First Court, but was released due to insufficient evidence. He resented Li Axiang's son, Buyun, and wanted to deal with him. Buyun, a worker in the Ewo Cotton Mill, was very afraid when he heard about it and often had friends protect him. At 7 pm on the 12th of this month, after finishing work at the factory, Sheng and more than ten thugs waited for him near Qiwupu Road, Shengshan Road. Without asking the situation, they rushed up and knocked him to the ground. He pulled out a small knife and stabbed him in the head and buttocks, trying to escape. Chinese detective Lu Baosheng and Chinese constable No. 1366 arrived and arrested Sheng, taking him to the Yulin Road Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that the victim's father and son were both in the hospital for treatment and had not arrived. The blood stains, especially since he was previously handled for assaulting a constable a month ago, requested a postponement for detailed investigation. When questioned, Sheng claimed that Li Buyun assembled many people yesterday and beat him up. He was captured, and his companions used a knife to stab him, causing him to face lawsuits.

<h3>Shen Xuezhen, a Woman from Pudong, Sues Zhu Mingquan for Offenses Against Public Morality – Case Concluded After Hearing, Judgment to be Announced Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Shen Xuezhen, a woman from Pudong, was formerly a concubine of Qiu Guiqing, residing at No. 111, Peide Lane, Datong Road. Since March 25th of last year, through the enticement of a young matchmaker, she met Zhu Mingquan, a native of Nanhui and owner of Zhu Mingji Construction Factory at No. 22, Lane 33, Chengdu Road. That day, they engaged in illicit behavior at Room 54, Pacific Hotel, Guangxi Road. At that time, Zhu claimed to have no wife and would definitely marry her in the future. Since then, every week, they would secretly meet in a room at the Hongxiang Hotel, Avenue Edward VII. They also frequently rented rooms at the Tianran Hotel, Zhifu Road, and the Zhongnan Hotel, Avenue Edward VII. From November 2nd to the 28th of last year, they stayed in Room 22 of the Tianran Hotel for as long as 25 days. Zhu also instigated Shen to break away from Qiu. But recently, Zhu suddenly abandoned Shen, so Shen hired lawyer Wu Peng to file a complaint against Zhu in the First Special District Court for offenses against public morality, requesting that he be punished under Article 229 of the Criminal Code. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui presided over the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. According to Shen's statement of the course of events, Zhang Mingfu, a tea server at the Zhongnan Hotel, testified that Room 22 was opened from November 2nd to the 28th last year, with Zhu Mingji and Shen's names written in the register. Qiu Azhang, a tea server at the Pacific Hotel, testified that a Zhu Mingquan came to rent a room for one day with a family member on March 29th last year, but his face could not be clearly recognized. When questioned, Zhu Mingquan admitted that he met the plaintiff at the Xin Xin Company's Dajing troupe. He also admitted that the plaintiff took the initiative to open a room at the Pacific Hotel. He admitted to the adultery at hotels such as Hongxiang and Tianran, but denied instigating Shen to break away from her husband. Judge Liu, with the facts clear, ordered the lawyers from both sides to begin their arguments and then adjourned the hearing, scheduling the judgment to be announced on the afternoon of the 15th.</p>
<h3>How Did His Wife Die? – Xu Fengting Pursues His Brother-in-Law</h3>
<p>Xu Fengting, a 37-year-old jade dealer from Yangzhou, residing at No. 98, Linyin Branch Lane, outside the West Gate, married the younger sister of his fellow villager Jiang Ruan. The couple's relationship was harmonious. Last year, Xu Fengting suffered from a serious internal illness and was hospitalized. Xu's wife, Jiang, had no one to take care of her, so her elder brother Jiang Ruan took her away. A few days later, Jiang Ruan reported to Xu that his sister had died and brought a letter as proof. At that time, Xu was seriously ill and unable to attend to it. Until now, after recovering from his illness, he questioned Jiang about his wife's unclear death, which he could not explain in detail, and the coffin was nowhere to be found. Yesterday morning at 11 am, they were arguing at the Huayuan on Fangbang Bridge. Police officer Wang Huaili, hearing about it, brought them to the Lao Beimen Police Station for investigation because the case involved a human life. After questioning, the defendant was found to have lured, hidden, and falsely reported the death, and was ordered to be sent to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Heart Testing</h3>
<p>Dr. Ding Huikang, the director of the Hongqiao Sanatorium, purchased the latest type of electrocardiograph *Elektrocardiograph* when he inspected Europe last year. It has been installed recently. For all kinds of heart diseases, arteriosclerosis, high blood pressure, infectious diseases, and after lung diseases, if you want to test whether the heart function is complete, you can use the three automatic guidance types of the machine to get the most accurate report in a few minutes. It is not only of great help in terms of treatment, but also of greater significance in preventing unexpected events. It is said that the initial stage of heart disease is only slightly short of breath when walking. In recent times, people are increasingly busy. Due to the advancement of diagnosis in various countries, the discovery of heart diseases is also increasing day by day.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Accuses Biological Mother and Lover of Torture</h3>
<p>Lin Yicheng, a 19-year-old from Changzhou, is an apprentice at the Zhenhexiang Hardware Store on Xingsheng Street. He was sent by the store manager to deliver funds to the old store, but was pickedpocketed. The store ordered Lin's mother, Xu, to compensate. Xu has a lover, Wang Jinkun, who has always been a thorn in Lin Yicheng's side. He instigated Lin Xu to torture her own son, hanging him up and beating him, forcing him to admit embezzlement before expelling him. Lin Yicheng, in view of his father's bones not yet cold, and that the Yuchang Rosewood Store left by his father, located at No. 431, Fangbang Road, will be squandered by his biological mother and her lover, he was unwilling to accept this and, being seriously injured by the torture, sought medical verification from the Procuratorate of the Shanghai Local Court and submitted an indictment, suing his biological mother, Lin Xu, and her lover, Qing Jinkun, for obstructing freedom, and private torture and injury.</p>
<h3>Li Tiankui Accused of Raping Goddaughter</h3>
<p>Lu Chen, a 39-year-old woman from Tongzhou residing at No. 14, Xujiazhai, Jinji Bridge, West Shanghai, accompanied by her 17-year-old daughter Lu Maotou, reported to the responsible police station at about 10 o'clock the night before last, accusing Li Tiankui, a 49-year-old man from Hebei residing at No. 34 next door, of raping her daughter Maotou and threatening her with a knife. Police chief Li Xuede, after receiving the report, sent police to arrest Li Tiankui and bring him back to the station. After questioning by director Yi, Lu Chen claimed that her daughter Maotou is 17 years old. Last summer, Li Tiankui, a neighbor, often came to her house to play and insisted on adopting her daughter. Seeing his sincerity, she told her daughter to recognize him as her godfather. Unexpectedly, Li Tiankui was a beast in human clothing. Last winter, he tricked Maotou into his house and raped her, threatening her with a knife not to speak out. In October, he tricked her to Xieqiao under the pretext of watching a show and told her about all the past deceptions and rapes. She finally learned the truth and reported to the police for investigation. Lu Maotou's statement coincided with the foregoing. However, the defendant Li Tiankui consistently denied it, stating that it was because Lu Chen owed him money and refused to pay it back, which caused him to hate her. The director, considering the case involved accusations of rape, instructed that it be prepared and sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Ningbo Merchant Ma Yuren Sends Letter to Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association – Describes Tragic Situation of Tomb Relocation</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai has repeatedly reported the case of tomb relocation in various towns in Ningbo, which has been disputed by the Ningbo Association in Shanghai. Now, Ma Yuren, a Ningbo merchant in Shanghai, sent a letter to the association, describing the tragic situation and asking the association to find ways to remedy it. The letter said: After seeing the news in Ningbo and Shanghai newspapers about the tomb relocation in our Ningbo, this matter can finally come to an end. But for us ordinary people, whether abroad or at home, the mental and material losses caused by this matter are like a dumb person eating *huanglian* (a bitter Chinese herb), and we can't express it. Now that we can survive for the time being, it is a blessing from heaven. Alas, those who have not been demolished can rest assured, but how can those who have been destroyed feel good? In the documents of the former county magistrate and township offices, it says "…there are wild graves and exposed coffins beside the villages, which are everywhere, not only hindering public health, but also…" According to this order, it seems that it is undoubtedly necessary to expand and relocate the exposed coffins because they hinder hygiene and appearance. However, before, the township offices unauthorized destroyed the actual tombs of tomb owners who were abroad or far away and had not registered in time (what was destroyed were all well-quality actual tombs, not dilapidated tombs and genuinely ownerless exposed coffins). Naturally, the tomb materials were sold completely. But the disinterred bones, still several, were placed in a small coffin together and abandoned by the roadside, piled up like a mountain, exposed to the sun and rain. I don't know when they can be buried. Thinking of this, I can't help but feel emotional. The late Sun Yat-Sen's legacy, the world is for the public. The New Life Movement promotes filial piety first. Who in life does not have the corpses of parents and ancestors? Because it involves others, we look forward to achieving great harmony. The township offices have other intentions for such cruel actions. Leaving aside that, the small coffins containing the corpses abandoned by the roadside should be disposed of in a way that calms people's hearts. For this reason, I am writing to your association, and asking you to quickly contact the You County Government to order the burial as soon as possible, to obtain humanity, etc. It is heard that the association will forward the letter to the Yin County Government, requesting the townships to pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>American Criminal Reuben Arrested</h3>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, We have reviewed the "New Jinggang Canal Excavation Completed" item in the Shanghai News column of your newspaper on the 12th of this month. The facts are slightly inaccurate. This canal is a waterway recently excavated by the city government. The necessary water drainage, dam construction, and office expenses are paid for by the city government's funds. Those who cannot work will pay a substitute labor fee, which will be used by the dredging office to hire workers to do it instead. However, due to the failure of the various households to respond enthusiastically, the project has been slow to progress and has not yet been completed. This is a special letter stating the actual situation. Please investigate and correct it in the Letters column. Respectfully, Second Section, Public Works Bureau of Shanghai Municipality, May 13th.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, The "Shao Lizi's Shanghai Residence Robbed" item in the Shanghai News column of your newspaper on the 13th of this month contains statements that are not in line with the facts. According to Wang Shugen, he is a fellow villager and clansman of Madam Shao, but your newspaper mistakenly reported him as Madam Shao's brother. It also stated that Wang had borrowed 200 yuan from Madam Shao on the 9th of this month, but it was not successful. After investigation, the above facts did not occur on the 9th of this month, which is probably due to inaccurate investigation by your newspaper. In order to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world, I hope you will publish a correction in the Letters column. Shao Residence, No. 6, Masnan Road.</p>

<h3>Glass Manufacturing Industry in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Compiled by China Credit Information</p>
<p>(Twenty-Fourth Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce)</p>
<p>3. Jinghua Glass Factory – Established in July of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), it was founded by Xu Zhaohe, Wang Jingye, and others. The factory is located at 1459 Bailinan Road. The original capital was 50,000 yuan, and it is now planned to increase to 250,000 yuan. Mr. Xu Guannan is currently the chairman of the board, and Xu Zhaohe is the manager. Its products are mainly glass bottles, with an annual turnover of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>4. Jingxin Glass Factory – This factory is solely owned and operated by Mr. Zhou Wenmei. It was founded in September of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932). The initial capital was approximately 10,000 yuan, and it has now reached over 50,000 yuan. The factory is located at No. 100, Lane 679, Xiaoshadu. It has two furnaces and fifteen bottle-making machines, specializing in the production of various types of glass bottles, which are sold in this port and various ports in South China and along the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>5. Guangming Kettle &amp; Electric Appliance Co., Ltd. – This factory was established in the 14th year of the Republic of China (1925). It was initiated and organized by Lei Binglin, Wu Dingming, and others, with a capital of 180,000 yuan. The factory is located at Room 110, Qingyun Road, Zhabei. The factory's buildings and land are all owned property. It employs over 200 male and female workers and currently specializes in the production of insulated kettles, with an annual turnover of over 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Glass Sales and Market Conditions – As mentioned earlier, the products of various glass factories in this port mainly consist of bottles, cups, basins, jars, and other utensils. Due to successive improvements, they are quite capable of competing with foreign goods (especially Japanese goods). As for their sales, most are limited to this port and the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Although some are shipped to places such as Jiujiang, Wuhu, and Hankou, the number is small, only reaching 50-60% of the sales in this port. The various factories in this port have three methods for promoting the sale of goods: first, order transactions; second, wholesale transactions; and third, door-to-door sales. Order transactions involve customers who want to order specific types of glassware personally contacting the factory to negotiate prices. The price for ordered goods is calculated per piece for items with very large volumes, per dozen for items of ordinary size, and per hundred for particularly small items such as ten-drop medicine bottles. The period from placing the order to delivery varies, generally around three weeks. Wholesale transactions involve buyers first informing the factory of the names of the items they intend to purchase in order to assess the quality of the goods. After agreeing on the quality, they then negotiate the quantity and price. After the transaction is completed, the goods are either delivered by the factory or picked up by the buyer, with no fixed arrangement. Door-to-door sales are commonly used by small glass factories. This method involves the factory hiring salesmen to carry glass products daily and sell them door-to-door to middle and upper-class grocery stores. The sales volume is not as large as wholesale transactions. As for flat glass, in the past, most were imported from overseas. Now, the past year's selling prices of No. 4 original sheet glass are listed below for reference (priced per 100 square feet, price unit: yuan):</p>
<p>January, Year 24: 7.80 July: 6.00</p>
<p>February: 7.80 August: 6.00</p>
<p>March: 7.40 September: 6.20</p>
<p>April: 7.40 October: 6.20</p>
<p>May: 6.80 November: 7.10</p>
<p>June: 6.00 December: 7.10</p>
<p>Note: The figures are based on the Shanghai Commodity Price Monthly Report compiled by the National Tariff Commission.</p>
<p>This year, prices have continued to rise, with January at 7.25, February at 7.30, and March at 7.50. This is closely related to the exchange rate of legal tender.</p>
<p>In addition, the import and market price of broken glass are also worth mentioning. Broken glass is mainly imported from the United States, with approximately 400-500 tons imported annually, specifically for use as raw material by various factories in this port. The current market price is approximately 14 US dollars per ton. In order to reduce costs, the factories in this port often purchase broken glass from this port, as its selling price is much cheaper than that of American goods. Currently, the only company in this port engaged in the import of broken glass is Dafa Import and Export Company at No. 215 Sichuan Road. (End)</p>

<h3>Track and Field Training Class - Third Performance Test Record</h3>
<p>Jia Ren, Huang Yingjie, and Peng Yongxin Break National Records. The Third Test Shows Significant Progress Compared to the First Two.</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Beiping) Our country's track and field training class participating in the World Games held its third performance test at Tsinghua University in the western suburbs of Beiping at 4:00 PM on the 11th. The test included nine events: 100 meters, 400 meters, 1500 meters, hurdles, long jump, pole vault, shot put, discus, and javelin. The results were excellent, with all events exceeding the expected standards except for the long jump. The 1500 meters, hurdles, and javelin events all broke national records. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Record Broken 1: Jia Lianren broke the national record in the 1500 meters with a time of 4 minutes 13 seconds. During the race, the veteran Liu Changchun competed closely with Jia. In the first and third laps, Liu was sweating profusely, but Jia seemed unaffected and steadily progressed. The initial 300 meters for Jia was 45 seconds, reaching 700 meters in 1 minute 40 seconds, and 1100 meters in exactly 3 minutes. The atmosphere was tense. Liu also accelerated, but Jia won the championship with a speed of 4 minutes 13 seconds at the finish line. According to the abilities of Japanese athletes Tanaka and Aochi, they are not necessarily superior to Jia. In his first test, Jia set a new national record in the 800 meters. In the second test, he achieved an excellent time of 52.4 seconds in the 400 meters.</p>
<p>Record Broken 2: Huang Yingjie broke the national record in the high hurdles with a time of 16 seconds. During the race, Huang and Lin Shaozhou were the most dedicated. After passing five hurdles, Lin was about three meters ahead of Huang, but Lin withdrew midway. Huang continued to strive, ultimately setting a new national record. Huang previously achieved a time of 16.4 seconds in the National Games last year. After returning to Guangdong, he worked hard on the 100 meters. Now, after participating in the training class in Beiping, he has considerable confidence. A 16-second record in the high hurdles makes him arguably the best Chinese athlete. It is hoped that Huang will continue to work hard.</p>
<p>Record Broken 3: Peng Yongxin set a new national record in the javelin with a throw of 51.53 meters. During the competition, Peng competed closely with athletes Zhou Changxing and Cheng Mengping. Zhou lost his fighting ability due to slight pain in his left arm, eventually withdrawing from the competition. Peng threw the javelin with great effort, but when he threw 51.53 meters, his foot was only an inch away from the board. Breaking the national record was truly achieved in a precarious situation. Cheng Mengping finished second with a throw of 46.30 meters.</p>
<p>Athletes Come and Go Busily: Wang Mingshen, the tiger general from Northeast China, is famous for holding the national record in the 800 meters. He has now brought his family to Beiping and continues to practice, showing a strong resurgence. Wang has an unofficial time of under two minutes in the 800 meters. Also, the Shanghai All-City Spring Games will be moved forward to the 19th before returning south.</p>
<p>Results of Each Test</p>
<p>100 Meters: 1st Zhao Bingheng 11 seconds (passing standard), 2nd Liu Shikui, 3rd Zhou Changxing</p>
<p>Pole Vault: 1st Fu Baolu 3.87 meters (passing standard), 2nd Wang He did not complete the jump due to a leg injury.</p>

<p>High Hurdles: 1st Huang Yingjie 16 seconds (new national record), 2nd Zhou Changxing, Lin Shaozhou withdrew after clearing five hurdles.</p>
<p>400 Meters: 1st Dai Shuguo 52.5 seconds (passing), 2nd Li Shiming. Li Shiming failed because he came from afar and lacked training.</p>
<p>Long Jump: 1st Wang Shilin 6.64 meters</p>
<p>Discus: 1st Cheng Mengping 36.24 meters (passing)</p>
<p>Shot Put: 1st Chen Baoqiu 12.62 meters (passing), Javelin: 1st Peng Yongxin 51.53 meters (new national record), 2nd Cheng Mengping, 3rd Lin Shaozhou reached the goal with 51.53 meters.</p>

<h3>Finance: Although Customs Gold Units Fall</h3>
<p>The Gold Market, Weak Then Firm, Continues to Rise One Yuan as the Central Bank Accepts Spot. Although Backwardation Approaches, the Atmosphere Is Quite Calm.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market opened weakly due to the drop in London spot gold. The Central Bank intermittently accepted spot at a price of 33 yuan, gradually boosting confidence and stimulating buying, which led to price increases. This was largely due to the cash opening price helping buyers. In the early morning, the overseas silver market showed no change in both the UK and the US. Sources claimed that after the market closed, Indian and speculative buyers entered below the listed price of 0.0625. The backwardation in the forward silver price in Monterey narrowed by 1.5 to 2 fen. The exchange rate rose. London spot gold fell by 3.5 pence. The Central Bank's listed prices showed no change in both the UK and the US. The listed price of the standard gold unit fell to 1140.2 yuan. Outside the market, preliminary trading opened and retreated to around 33 yuan. Dadecheng, Hengchang, and Yonglaijin began to slightly push it up. After opening, it was still relatively stable, but due to some spot firms selling, supply exceeded demand in the market, gradually declining. HSBC's listed prices showed no change in both the UK and the US, presenting a sideways trend. However, there was still a slight drop afterward. The announcement of the silver equalization tax showed no change. Subsequently, Futai bought 700 bars at a price of 33 yuan, which improved sentiment. Major players also gradually bought in, gradually increasing the price. The trend turned bullish at noon. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1133.4 yuan, a drop of 7 jiao compared to the previous close. Chunyuan, Yongda, and Fayong jointly advanced, rising to 3 yuan 7 jiao. Hengyu, Dingkang, and Yongde sold off, retreating to 2 yuan 9 jiao. Yicheng, Qiafeng, Yongda, Dedingkang, Yuanmao, and Yongchunyuan sold off in large quantities, dropping to 2 yuan 8 jiao. Futai Heng Yicheng and Dadecheng still purchased, rising to 3 yuan 2 jiao. HSBC's listed prices showed no change in both the UK and the US. At this time, the market situation was calm. Later, the price dropped to 2 yuan 6 jiao as Jingfu and Dingkang sold bars. The announcement of the silver equalization tax showed no change. Futai Heng Dadecheng Hengyu Yuantai Huixiang Qianyuan Yongyuanchang Yongtong Taichang Xiang Fengyu Qingyong jointly purchased, gradually rebounding to 5 yuan 8 jiao. Fuxing Yongyuan Mao Yong took advantage of the high price to sell off. The noon closing was 1135.2 yuan, which was flat after closing.</p>
<p>The closing price, according to the Central Bank's standard gold unit price, dropped to around 1140 yuan. The June book entry price was 1135 yuan, and the morning supplement was 1135 yuan. The price of pure gold was increased by 5 yuan to 1138.4 yuan. The spot market was stable. Tianjin goods were increased by 13.5 yuan, and smelted red was increased by 12 yuan, but there was a lack of matching transactions. The Central Bank once opened to accept 700 spot bars, reportedly at a price of 33 yuan, which was very close to the futures price.</p>
<p>Market trading was normal. In total, Futai Heng (transferring 161 bars to Shengyuan Yong, 105 bars each to Qian Changxiang, Dafeng, and Heng, 91 bars each to Dadecheng, Yingfeng, and Heng, and 42 bars to Yuanmao Yong at a price of 33.5 yuan), Fayong Yong, Dadecheng, Yicheng, Shunmao, Xiangfeng, Tongtai Chang, Chunyuan Yong, etc. were on the buying side. Jingfu, Qianyuan Yong, Dachangxiang, Fuxing Yong, Qingfayong, Yuanmao Yong, Huixiang, Wanxing, etc. were on the selling side. Dadecheng Hengchang Yong first advanced and then exited, while Yongde Chunyuan Yong first exited and then advanced.</p>
<p>The market situation for the first half of the day was initially weak but later strengthened. The morning opened at 1133.4 yuan, and the noon closing was 1135.2 yuan. The highest price was 1135.8 yuan, and the lowest price was 1132.6 yuan, with a fluctuation of 3 yuan 2 jiao. As a result, it rose by 1 yuan 1 jiao compared to the previous close. The total turnover for the first half of the day was 7000 bars.</p>

<h3>Chinese Merchants Buying in, the Foreign Exchange Market Is Flat for Sterling and Soft for US Dollars</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw the exchange rate lengthen, causing sterling to be flat and the US dollar to be soft. Although Chinese merchants were buying, the process was relatively calm. In the early morning, overseas telegrams reported that the London market was flat for both near and far positions. It was claimed that after the market closed, Indian and speculative buyers bought in at 0.0625 below the listed price. The New York silver market showed no change. The backwardation in the forward silver price in Monterey narrowed by 1.5 to 2 fen. London spot gold fell by 3.5 pence. Sterling rose against the US dollar by 1.25 points. Sterling rose against the French franc by 18 points. The US dollar rose against sterling by 1 point, and the US dollar narrowed against the French franc by 0.5 points. The Central Bank's listed prices showed no change in both the UK and the US. The Customs Gold Unit fell by 9 fen. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with recent selling prices of 1 shilling 2 pence 4375 for sterling and 29 yuan 9375 for US dollars, indicating that sterling was flat and the US dollar was soft by 0.0625 compared to the previous close. This was largely due to the exchange rate lengthening. After opening, banks were either buying or selling, and there were matching transactions, but it was relatively calm. HSBC's listed prices showed no change in both the UK and the US, and the announcement of the silver equalization tax was also flat. At this time, banks continued to match transactions, and there was little impact. Later, although there was large-scale buying by Chinese merchants, the trend slightly tightened due to bank buying. At midday, the recent selling prices were 1 shilling 2 pence 4375 for sterling and 29 yuan 9375 for US dollars, indicating that sterling was flat and the US dollar was soft by 0.0625 compared to the previous close. The same was true for forward positions. Chinese merchants bought approximately 400,000 US dollars. Xinfeng also bought in. Dongfang sold sterling, taking profits. The results are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening for sterling was at a recent selling price of 1 shilling 2 pence 4375. Youli bought September 3125 and 375 pairs. Dongfang sold August 375 to Great Britain. Youli accepted the same month at the same price. Shanghai sold September 3125 and 375 pairs to Great Britain. Dongfang sold August 375 to Youli and July 375 and 4375 pairs. The selling and buying prices at midday were 1 shilling 2 pence 4375 for spot, with monthly differentials of 0.03125 thereafter.</p>
<p>The morning opening for US dollars was at a recent selling price of 29 yuan 9375. Shanghai bought June 875. Zhongnan sold to Xinfeng. Holland sold May 9375 to Dongfang. Shanghai Citibank bought the same month at the same price. Citibank sold July 8125 to Xinfeng. Korea sold May 9375 to Xinfeng. Dongya sold May 9375 to Macgregors. Macgregors sold June 875 to Dongya.

The closing selling and buying prices were 29 yuan 9375, with monthly differentials of 0.03125 thereafter.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Suddenly Rise, an Unexpected Rally, Recent Ding Issues Soar by Over One Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw considerable trading. The sudden rally in market prices was truly abnormal. According to the Customs' announcement of smuggling, the value of goods involved reached a massive 30 million. Rumors circulated in the market about a 20 million loan being established. At the same time, both the securities and cotton yarn exchanges received an unexpected stimulus, and market prices soared. Various groups shifted from short to long positions, one after another. However, viewing the financial performance of issues 46, 47, 54, and 72, which are close to the financial sector, as they came onto the market, the various groups' enthusiastic buying created opportunities for them. Therefore, the claim of a loan cannot be trusted. It is unknown whether it was actual cash or goods. Because after Issue A once found a new high price, forward positions were all backwardated, and the long positions were showing signs of exhaustion. A slight relaxation would inevitably lead to a sharp drop because it could only advance and not retreat. Yesterday's process was extremely flat and weak in the morning. Due to the sudden passing of Mr. Hu Hanmin, sentiment was slightly dampened. Opening prices saw highs and lows, varying by one or two jiao. The second session was weak, falling slightly by 0.05 to 0.25 jiao. Most of the sellers were from the financial sector, and the buyers were mostly from the northern groups. In the afternoon, the situation suddenly changed, and rumors flew, all completely baseless. However, the northern groups' buying was unusually enthusiastic. At the same time, various firms close to the financial sector were all selling, and the long positions in Issues 4 and 11 also came onto the market. Therefore, after Issue A once found a new high price of 69.2 yuan, it immediately fell back. Forward positions were smaller than recent ones, and both sessions saw backwardation, revealing a flaw in the market. Therefore, after the sharp rise in the third session, the closing price of Issue A had fallen back slightly by 0.15 jiao. There were many changes ahead. As a result, market prices unanimously continued to rise by 0.35 to 0.79 jiao. Recent Ding issues soared by over one yuan. The total value of transactions was 6.86 million yuan. The results of the rises and falls, expressed as ratios, are listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Bulls and Bears Each Show Off Their Skills, Cotton Yarn Sees Repeated Ups and Downs, Afternoon Sees a Sudden Change, Marked Yarn Re-emerges Above the 200 Yuan Mark, Trading Is Extremely Active, Closing Is Extended to Around 6:00 PM</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market has seen wild drops and sharp rises recently, and the situation is unusually turbulent. This is because the minds of general speculators are feverish, entering and exiting suddenly in huge amounts. The chips for both long and short positions increase daily, leading to rapid changes, changing several times a day. It began with a certain account, uniformly tightening and rising. It was expected that the second session's rally would settle down slightly, and the sellers would be actively applying pressure, causing the price of the far month contracts to fall sharply by 1.78 yuan. In the afternoon, the momentum shifted. By the closing, the market situation for the June contract changed rapidly. Sellers suddenly disappeared, and buying voices clamored above 200 yuan. For a time, favorable rumors abounded, and the rally was extremely strong, jumping by 2.67 yuan. All months broke through the 100 yuan mark together.</p>
<p>Marked Yarn Pulled Up by 2-3 Yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the marked yarn market, the near month contracts were unchanged, and the June contract fell slightly by 0.3 jiao. When trading the far month contracts, a certain giant absorbed them forcefully, causing the price to tighten extremely. All months rose by one yuan. Unexpectedly, the second session was relatively flat, and when the third session opened, the situation was stagnant. The short positions suddenly became active, applying considerable pressure, causing the far month contracts to plummet by 1.57 yuan. As a result, all months fell by 0.79 jiao to 1.24 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. However, the current month rose by 0.3 jiao. The trend tightened in the afternoon opening, and all months rose differently by 0.68 jiao to one yuan. However, rumors arose in the market after entering, and sentiment became extremely tense. The buying forces surged in like a tide. By the time of closing, sellers of the June contract suddenly disappeared, and general floating holders panicked, creating a chaotic clamor. Later, after Dafu issued a large quantity, and Xin Chengyu and Dashen Chang suddenly made efforts to add positions, the market situation was suppressed. The closing price of each month jumped by 2.56 jiao to 1.6 yuan compared to the third session price. However, the long positions of the major players continued to absorb forcefully. As a result, all months uniformly broke out of the 200 yuan mark, rising by 1.4 jiao to 3.5-4.1 yuan compared to the morning closing price. The reason for this was that the continuous drop had exceeded ten yuan, and at the same time, spot yarn saw customer activity for purchasing due to the low price. It was found that Dafu sold 6550 bales, Jifeng 1150 bales, Deda 1000 bales, Taixing 1150 bales, Yuda 3600 bales, Dafeng 1150 bales, Yuanji 1950 bales, Gengfeng 1000 bales, Dachangcheng 1850 bales, Yiyong 1700 bales, Runkang 1050 bales, Dachang 2050 bales, Jinghua 2050 bales, and Xincheng 4300 bales. The purchases were Yuanda 1300 bales, Mingde 1200 bales, Zhouxing 950 bales, Shenji 2800 bales, Renfeng 2300 bales, Yuan Yi 1300 bales, Taichang 3400 bales, Changfeng 4850 bales, Xiecheng 3250 bales, Runkang 850 bales, Hengchang 1000 bales, Tonghe 1600 bales, and Xinhua 1300 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Also Rises by 1-2 Yuan</p>
<p>Sales of spot yarn remain active. According to statistics, all groups bought a total of 1855 bales for the day, and the selling price rose by 1-2 yuan. The purchasing volume of each group is as follows:</p>
<p>The cotton market sees large ups and downs, and the situation is extremely treacherous. This is because the core members of the long position companies and the financial sector not only do not settle their positions, but rather drag in and add positions in large quantities. However, the floating longs with weaker strength have been liquidated in full. As for the short positions of cotton merchants, they already occupy an advantage and remain unmoved. However, Japanese mills are actively purchasing spot cotton.</p>
<p>The Current Month Rises by 0.65 Jiao</p>
<p>At the opening of the marked flower market, all months opened with high prices. The buying sentiment in the market was strong. The old sellers took advantage of the rise to sell in large quantities, putting considerable pressure. After the first session's rally, the sellers became active, and the market gradually trended downwards. By the closing, when trading far month contracts, they turned higher. As a result, all months rose by 0.09 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. At the opening in the afternoon, the current month jumped by 0.45 jiao. The market was especially strong, and there was a lack of sellers, bringing up the far month contracts. After the second session, the momentum became more and more upright. At the same time, favorable rumors in the market were dense and flattering, boosting sentiment, and high prices were uniformly shouted wildly. By the closing, which was already around 6:00 PM, the market sentiment weakened, and all months fell back by 0.34 jiao. However, the amount purchased by a certain party remained unmoved. As a result, all months rose by 0.125 jiao to 0.46 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Yuda sold 4100 piculs, Changji 2200 piculs, Shenchang 3400 piculs, Shengyuan 4100 piculs, Hexing 4400 piculs, Shenji 2500 piculs, Runkang 4800 piculs, Dachang 5700 piculs, Jinghua 8000 piculs, Xincheng 3400 piculs, and Yikang 3300 piculs. The purchases were Taichang 3500 piculs, Changfeng 13,100 piculs, Yicheng 3100 piculs, Senkang 2700 piculs, Tongji 2200 piculs, Mingde 6000 piculs, Gengfeng 2000 piculs, Yuan Yi 4800 piculs, Xiecheng 2500 piculs, Xinchang 6400 piculs, Runkang 5300 piculs, Yongchang 2200 piculs, and Yongda 1600 piculs. The highest, lowest, and closing prices between 200 companies are listed below.</p>
<h3>US New Cotton Is Weaker Due to Rain</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened, and there was a large demand from fellow traders for old cotton. The stockpiling department sold about 10,000 bales of the May contract at 0.1158 yuan. New cotton was relatively weak due to continued showers. After the broker absorbed the excess amount, it slightly improved. Off-market transactions were limited. If the government clears the stockpiled cotton, the future of the market is quite promising. Current demand is calm, and cloth is dull. The closing price was flat. Futures prices rose or fell by 0.01-0.02 pounds. UK spot cotton fell by one point, and futures rose by one to three points. Indian cotton dropped from near-term to far-term, and brokers slightly sold it. Scattered purchases were made. Flat Gul rose by 1.25 rupees, Wu Mula rose by 0.5-1.25 rupees, and Bairoxi rose by 0.5-1 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated the 12th).</p>
<p>According to the Mumbai telegram from Qudachengchao, the opening prediction for the July/August Bairoxi flower on the 13th was 198 rupees, down 0.75 rupees from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Slight Fluctuations in Three-Product Yarn and Flower</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from Osaka on the 13th, three-product futures yarn fell by 0.1-0.3 yuan, with the near month at 195 yuan and the far month at 194.1 yuan. Cotton futures rose or fell by 0.05-0.15 yuan, with the near month at 63.9 yuan and the far month at 59.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Local Mill Coarse Cloths Fall, Influenced by the Sudden Drop in Various Grades of Yihua Mill</h3>
<p>The dull situation of cotton cloth, despite being slightly brightened by the previous day's sharp rise in yarn and flowers, saw a slight return in sentiment. However, the buying appetite of various parties was weak, and sentiment was uncertain. Yesterday, yarn and flowers saw a market downturn, and the cloth market relaxed. The selling prices of various goods, including fancy goods, occasionally fell, depending on the amount of inventory. The selling prices of local color cotton cloth and eastern goods were unchanged. Local mill coarse cloths were affected by the sudden drops in various grades of light and heavy coarse cloths from Yihua Mill, and they all followed, falling by 0.025-0.1 yuan per bolt. Scarce arrivals, such as Minfeng Mill's 14-pound Dog Head coarse cloth, were still able to maintain their original prices. The Qingdao group purchased 60 pieces of Shenxin Mill's 14-pound Four-Plain Ao Aolian coarse cloth, and the Guangdong group purchased over 100 pieces of Shenxin Mill's 16-pound and 14-pound Four-Plain Lian, with an optimistic outlook, all destined for special military purposes. 25 pieces of Yihua Mill's 16-pound Five-Blessing coarse cloth, loaded onto a sand boat, were headed to the three northeastern provinces.</p>
<h3>White Woolen Fabrics Are Popular, Standard Prices Rise Due to Scarcity</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Wednesday, the Ni Rong Gong Yi Hui market was stable and firm. Retail transactions were brisk, and there were successes at various tea parties in Changle Yi Linchun. 70-80% were summer white goods, such as white Zhigong, white Biji, white Zhuye, white ash feather yarn, Tengpi Qu, and Palini. These were all selling well. Those who were ordering from foreign firms were quite crowded. Standard prices rose due to scarcity. Yesterday, the trading price of Fengyu white Biji was 6.4 yuan, and Yiji 1111 was 4.85 yuan. Eastern goods were 3.7 yuan for yellow-edged, 3.6 yuan for blue-edged, and 3.35 yuan for red-edged and natural-colored edged. Ordinary white Zhigong sold for 4.5 yuan, and second grade sold for 3.9 yuan. Western goods, Lihe brand, were 5.5 yuan, Heji Tianxiang was 5.7 yuan, and Yide was 5.3 yuan.</p>
<h3>Food: Many Changes in the June Contract, Rest of the Months See Little Fluctuation</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw the market surface present a fatigue followed by stability after opening in the morning. The quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago fell by 0.12-0.5 yuan, and Canada fell by about 0.2-0.3 yuan. At the opening price, foreign wheat was still small, and the weather also turned better, so sentiment was tired. The opening price for June was only 3.1 yuan, and distant months also saw fatigue. However, in the second session and below, June gradually rose again due to outside parties pulling in. The rest were stable. When the market opened in the afternoon, June saw good again because the goals of both parties were different, and the environment was used as bait. The rest of the months saw transactions turn light, and there was little fluctuation. Speaking in terms of the current situation, June saw the most changes. A moment's rise or fall is feared to be precisely what the positive side has not yet achieved.</p>
<h3>Fluctuations in Wheat Futures Minimal; Weak Demand from Mills Depresses Spot Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw stability in the morning session across all months after opening. Although imported wheat prices were slightly down, ranging from ten, twenty, thirty, or even fifty cents, the volume of selling was low. Therefore, bids across all months remained calm, with July and August contracts rising by four or five cents compared to the previous day's closing price, while others remained unchanged. The afternoon session saw limited trading activity across all months, as the overall market was flat and slightly weakened. Given the unpredictable weather and the distant new wheat harvest, the market is expected to consolidate. The spot market is suffering due to poor demand from mills, causing high prices to decline gradually. Consequently, Bengbu and Yaowan wheat was priced at $4.71, a drop of fourteen cents from the previous day, involving 1,500 bags purchased by Fuxin. The U.S. wheat market assessment by the government, based on May 1st conditions, indicates slight improvement in crops. Since May 1st, heavy rains have continued. External shipments of wheat, intended for May futures deliveries, have recently softened. Canadian wheat production estimates have been reduced by 8,645,000 bushels, slightly reducing market optimism.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat, May 12th, May 12th</p>
<h3>Rice Market Remains Weak</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's arrivals from various sources totaled just over ten shipments, amounting to over 2,000 stones. There was relatively more Bo rice. Sales in the local market remained slow. Baozi handled over 1,000 packages of Bo rice from Tianjin and other regions, resulting in a softer market for thick early japonica rice. The price of Bo rice was stable. The price of Du Yang pointed rice remained weak, with no significant change in Yin Bian Yuan rice.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday's arrivals from various river routes were slightly higher, numbering thirty-seven or thirty-eight shipments. Sales of all types of rice remained sluggish. The price of white japonica rice slightly decreased by a few cents to one dime. Continuous arrivals of Bo rice led to stagnant retail sales and a price decrease of about one dime. Yin Yuan rice was stable. White Yuan rice turned sluggish, with prices falling by nearly one dime. Yang Du pointed rice decreased by four or five cents, and the price of Ke pointed rice was weak. Prices for other varieties were also soft.</p>
<h3>Dealers and Wholesalers Eager to Sell; Customer Sentiment Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the customer Indica rice market saw continued arrivals from the Yangtze River and Wenzhou-Taizhou regions, resulting in ample supply and persistently weak demand. With hot weather, dealers and wholesalers were eager to sell to avoid prolonged storage. Although inland and Quanzhou buyers purchased late-season Jiangxi machine-milled rice, and demand on Shuijie Street was good, heavy selling pressure caused the market to slightly weaken, with prices falling by five cents to nearly one dime compared to the previous day. Total daily sales included 4,000 bags of Jiangxi rice, 100 bags of Hunan rice, 700 bags of Taiwan rice, and 300 bags of small-batch rice. Except for the late-season Jiangxi rice bought by customers, all other varieties were purchased by local dealers. Market sentiment suggests that dealers' eagerness to sell, driven by a lack of confidence, will likely lead to further price declines.</p>
<h3>Soybean Cake Price Drop Stimulates Sales</h3>
<p>Recently, soybean cake sales have been affected by unfavorable weather conditions, delaying distribution to inland areas. Large purchases by Guangdong and Liang Guang merchants have been undermined by Northeast bean cakes. Consequently, limited sales to remaining inland wholesalers and a few destinations like Fuzhou and Xiamen have forced manufacturers to lower prices to reduce growing inventories. Yesterday, Dayouyu Factory discounted 4,000 pieces of their "Four Brand" bean cake to $1.90, purchased by wholesalers serving inland markets. The price of raw material soybeans also weakened. Yesterday's sales included over 430 bags of Du Yellow soybeans, 250 bags of Andong soybeans, one truckload of Changchun soybeans, and one truckload of Harbin soybeans, all purchased by local retailers.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Market Quiet and Dull</h3>
<p>Yesterday's local silk market remained inactive. The price of New York and Habin silk continued to decline, and the international market remained weak, resulting in sparse silk transactions. Export sales of Chinese silk suffered setbacks, and domestic users lacked interest. The Shanghai silk market is gradually entering a state of stagnation.</p>
<h3>April Silk Export Statistics</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau's Silk Inspection Group under the Ministry of Industry, the quantity of Shanghai raw silk exports in the latter half of April has been previously reported. A review of the entire month of April shows that Shanghai exported a total of 1,243 bales of raw silk and 2,091 bales of waste silk, totaling 3,234 bales. Details are listed in the table below.</p>
<h3>Expired Italian Artificial Silk Transshipped to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The customs-auctioned inventory of "120-" numbered Da Qiao Brand has been exhausted. No private imports have arrived, and sales are weak, with a current price of around $300. Local silk factories purchased 25 cases of 120-numbered Sino Ayer No. 4 glossy silk for $280 per case. Yesterday's duty was also about $280 per case, leaving no profit beyond the duty. Sock factories purchased ten cases of 150-numbered Sino Ayer No. 3 matte silk for $405 per case. This variety, due to its whiteness, is an excellent raw material for summer matte textiles and socks. The remaining inventory of approximately 140 cases of Italian silk is facing customs warehousing expiration and potential tariff increases. To avoid these risks, the goods are being transshipped to Hong Kong via mail.</p>
<h3>New Teas from Various Regions Arrive Successively in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Wuyuan New Tea Transactions in Small Quantities - Wuyuan green tea has traditionally been sold in bulk. However, this year, due to early harvesting and financial constraints, most tea-producing regions have switched to selling in small quantities. Recently, the price of teas purchased by various shops ranges from thirty cents to thirty-seven or thirty-eight cents per jin. Merchants estimate that the production volume is only 80% of last year's. Tea factories face tightened credit from tea warehouses, with only 96%勉力經營 (struggling to operate), while the rest remain on the sidelines. The decline in the tea industry in the county is unprecedented in recent years.</p>
<p>Wenzhou Eyebrow Pearl Tea Trading Begins - Yesterday, Yingfa Foreign Firm opened trading of Wenzhou shrimp-eye pearl tea, priced at $50 to $52, slightly higher by two or three dollars compared to the morning. English merchants and traders are restocking Zhen Mei tea from local estates and Wenzhou due to the upcoming ship departure dates. Sales remain stable. Sales of Wenzhou black tea are trending upward, with premium grades remaining firm and lower grades slightly softer. However, based on current market conditions, there are no major concerns. A total of 616 boxes of black and green tea were traded across the city, with the market showing signs of both rising and falling trends.</p>
<p>Gaozhuang Qihong Tea Soon to Arrive - According to sources from the Black Tea Distribution Office, a telegram was received from Hangzhou yesterday stating that over 160 boxes of Qimen West Road Gaozhuang black tea will arrive in Shanghai within a few days.</p>
<p>Zhuji Mao Tea Market Price Declines - News of the poor market for low-grade tea in Shanghai has weakened market sentiment. The selling price of Mao tea has fallen from $34-35 to $31-32, and prices are likely to continue to decline.</p>
<p>Suian New Green Tea Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday - Yesterday, Shengchang Prosperous Tea Warehouse transported 67 boxes of Luzhuang Suian Zhen Mei green tea from Hangzhou, and samples will be available for distribution today.</p>
<p>Tea Industry Association Report - Since the opening of Zhen Mei teas from various regions, merchants have been sending telegrams to foreign customers. However, most have not received responses or have received complaints about high prices, resulting in limited trading of Zhen Mei teas from regions like Huzhou and Wenzhou and soft prices. Wenzhou Pearl Tea samples have been available for several days, but merchants have yet to negotiate prices. Arrivals of Wenzhou black tea remain limited, and foreign firms indicate low demand, resulting in market instability. Suian Luzhuang Zhen Mei tea is expected to be available for sampling on the 14th.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Chaoqing Production Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market remained stable. The association's wholesale prices for Number 2, Number 4 coarse granulated white sugar, as well as Eastern red and white sugar for spot and transit goods, remained unchanged. The price of Number 4 Eastern white spot goods was discounted by Number 5. According to telegrams from Shantou yesterday, Chaoqing sugar produced domestically is scarce, with prices increasing by one or two dimes. However, the Shantou exchange rate rose to $1,148, slightly increasing the combined price compared to before. High-quality red sugar is scarce, while ordinary-quality red sugar is being purchased by merchants from Tianjin, resulting in firm prices. Local traders are offering over one hundred bags of high-quality Huanggang Qing sugar at $10, and one hundred seventy bags of Fuzhi red sugar at $11.50. Hainan red sugar traders may be willing to soften prices further. If the negotiated prices are close, a bulk transaction is expected within days.</p>
<p>The Sugar Industry Joint Company held its tender auction yesterday, with the total quota for Guangdong sugar being 6,158 bags. The tender prices remained unchanged. 587 bags of Shunde Factory's Five Sheep coarse white sugar were sold at $21.80, and Quxi Factory also sold a package at $21.60. There were no transactions for Number 2, Number 4 cotton white sugar, or medium granulated white sugar.</p>

<h3>Wang Qi</h3>
<p>— Su Zihan</p>
<p>Although both the states of Lu and Qi were descendants of meritorious officials from the founding of the Zhou Dynasty, they often fought each other. The state of Qi was larger and stronger, so it attacked the state of Lu more often.</p>
<p>In the spring of the eleventh year of Duke Ai of Lu, the ruler of Qi once again ordered the ministers Guo Shu and Gao Wu-pi to lead troops to attack the state of Lu. Within a few days, the large army reached the border of Lu.</p>
<p>At that time, the power of the state of Lu had fallen into the hands of the three families of the ministers Jisun, Shusun, and Mengsun. Among these three, Jisun was the most autocratic, and Shusun and Mengsun were not very happy with him. They were fighting for power and profit, but they made the state of Lu a mess.</p>
<p>When the Qi army came, Jisun discussed the matter with his retainer, Ran Qiu, who was a student of Confucius. Ran Qiu suggested that Jisun defend the city while Shusun and Mengsun lead troops to resist the Qi army. Jisun knew that Shusun and Mengsun were not in agreement with him and would not go out to fight. So, Ran Qiu said, "If that's the case, then it would be better for you, my lord, to lead the troops out to resist. You are the one in power in the state of Lu. If you don't go out to resist the invasion of Qi, it would be a disgrace to the state of Lu and also a disgrace to you, my lord. Moreover, the state of Lu has no shortage of soldiers and people, so it's not certain that we can't win against the Qi army. Unless they are not from Lu, they won't follow you out to fight. As long as they are from Lu, they should all follow you!"</p>
<p>They discussed a plan and agreed that Mengsun would lead the central army of Lu as the right army, and Ran Qiu would lead Jisun's seven thousand troops, along with three hundred soldiers from the defense of Wucheng, as the left army, to go out of the south gate to resist the Qi army.</p>
<p>At that time, there was a boy in the state of Lu named Wang Qi, who was still studying in school. When he heard that the Qi army had come to attack Lu and that Mengsun and Ran Qiu had led troops out of the city to resist, he thought to himself, "The state of Qi is truly unreasonable and barbaric. They often come to harass our state of Lu. Now they've come again. Although I am young, I am also a person from Lu. I am often angry at Qi's bullying of Lu. Now that our soldiers and generals have gone out of the city to fight to the death, why shouldn't I go? The teacher at school often says that as long as you are from Lu, you should defend Lu. Now I should help our soldiers and generals to fight. Even if I only kill one person from Qi, it would be avenging Lu and adding glory to Lu, and it would not be in vain for me to be a person from Lu! Good, that's what I'll do."</p>
<p>After Wang Qi made up his mind, he didn't tell the adults in his family. He took off his large clothes, picked up the bronze-headed spear that his family had made to defend against thieves, and quietly slipped out to the street.</p>
<p>When Wang Qi arrived on the street, he went to find his classmates and the little friends he usually played with. He began to speak, "The state of Qi has bullied our state of Lu enough. Now they've come to bully us again, and our soldiers and generals have gone out of the city to resist. The teacher at school often says to us, 'As long as you are from Lu, you must defend Lu.' Now is the time for us to defend Lu. Everyone, if you have courage, come with me to kill people from Qi!"</p>
<p>Someone said, "Isn't fighting going to lead to death?"</p>
<p>Wang Qi said, "As long as we can add glory to Lu, what does death matter!"</p>
<p>Three or four people said in unison, "Good! I have courage. I'm not afraid of death. Brother Wang, I'll go with you! But, we don't have weapons, what should we do?"</p>
<p>Wang Qi said, "That doesn't matter. Your families have knives and spears, and they have wooden sticks. Even if you don't have knives, spears, or wooden sticks, can't you use your fists and toes?"</p>
<p>Those three or four people said, "Good! We'll go home to find them. Brother Wang, wait for us here for a while."</p>
<p>Those three or four people ran off, and those who were timid and afraid of death gradually walked away, leaving only Wang Qi standing there, looking at the main street leading to the south gate and listening to the sounds of fighting and killing outside the south gate.</p>
<p>Before long, those three or four people who had gone back to find weapons returned. Wang Qi led this group of little heroes and strode towards the south gate.</p>
<p>Just as they reached the city gate of the south gate, they ran into Wang Qi's neighbor, Gongshu Wuren. Gongshu Wuren asked Wang Qi where he was going with weapons. Wang Qi said, "I'm going out of the city to help our soldiers and generals kill people from Qi."</p>
<p>Gongshu Wuren said, "So am I. Let's go together."</p>
<p>They went out of the city together.</p>
<p>As soon as Wang Qi and the others went out of the city gate, they saw many people, supporting the old and carrying the young, with bags on their backs, fleeing into the city in a panic. Some who couldn't walk were resting on the side of the road, and some were complaining, and some were crying.</p>
<p>When Gongshu Wuren saw this situation, he couldn't help but sigh and say, "There are so many official duties, and the exorbitant taxes are so heavy, that the people have been driven to the point where they have nowhere to turn. Now the Qi army has come again. If those in power could unite and work together to resist foreign countries, that would be fine. But now these ministers only know how to fight for power and profit, and the soldiers can't fight to the death. What's the point of that! Look how miserable these refugees are! It's all their doing!"</p>
<p>Wang Qi said, "Let's not worry about others, let's just worry about ourselves. It's the duty of a person from Lu to go out and fight to the death. There may be many people like us in Lu. We'll see later."</p>
<p>Gongshu Wuren said, "That's natural. If we laugh at others for not being able to fight to the death, and we can't fight to the death, wouldn't that be a joke? We must add glory to Lu, even if it means dying!"</p>
<p>They talked as they walked, and they were not far from the battlefield.</p>
<p>It is said that Mengsun and Ran Qiu, these two forces from Lu, went out of the south gate and arrived in the suburbs. Not far from Jiqu, they encountered the Qi army. Between the Qi army and the Lu army, there was the Si River. The Qi army was on the other side of the Si River, but the Lu army was on this side and did not cross over. Thanks to Ran Qiu saying so many words to encourage them, the Lu army finally crossed the Si River.</p>
<p>As the two armies faced each other, Ran Qiu's left army charged into the Qi formation. As soon as Mengsun's right army engaged with the Qi army, they were defeated. The Qi generals Chen Guan and Chen Zhuang led a force closely pursuing, all the way across the Si River.</p>
<p>When Wang Qi and the others arrived on the battlefield, Mengsun's right army had already been defeated, and the "Meng" flag was in utter disarray. However, the "Ran" flag on the left was stirring up a cloud of dust as it fought in the Qi formation.</p>
<p>When Wang Qi saw this, he said, "That 'Ran' flag must be Ran Qiu. He is a good man. Let's pass by this side and go over there to kill people from Qi!"</p>
<p>So Wang Qi and the others passed by the defeated soldiers of Mengsun's right army and rushed to the left side. With a loud shout, they raised their sticks and spears and charged in, joining forces with Ran Qiu. The fighting on both sides was so fierce that the sky and the earth changed color, and the sun and moon were darkened. It wasn't until the afternoon that they drove the Qi army back.</p>
<p>The next day, Wang Qi and the others were found dead on the battlefield. Their bodies were covered with wounds and blood, but they still looked full of life.</p>
<p>The people of Lu buried Wang Qi with the rites of an adult. When Confucius heard about it, he said, "Wang Qi was able to give up his life and forget his own safety to fight for Lu and add glory to Lu. Although he was a child, it is right to bury him with the rites of an adult."</p>
<p>It is right to say: Although Wang Qi was young, his loyal heart will last for thousands of years!</p>
<h3>Alexander Graham Bell (1847-1922)</h3>
<p>— Zhong Bao</p>
<p>—Inventor of the Telephone—</p>
<p>Bell was born on March 3, 1847, in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK. His father was a scholar who studied acoustics, and his mother was a great lover of music. From a young age, Bell learned from his parents and became accustomed to using his hearing, thus developing an interest in all sounds.</p>
<p>Bell was a very empathetic child. One day, he was listening to his mother playing the piano and felt very happy, but he suddenly thought that many people did not have such good fortune as he did, so he decided to ask his mother to play the piano for some deaf children to listen. The next morning, his mother was playing the piano again, and he, not having time to explain to people, hurriedly went to the street to pull someone to listen, but he accidentally pulled a deaf girl from the neighborhood. Because of her disability, the child was often bullied by other children. She thought Bell was going to bully her, so she struggled out of his hand and ran away. Bell was reluctant to let her go and chased after her. Just as he was chasing hard, suddenly a large hand stretched out from the side and blocked his way. Bell looked up and saw that it was none other than his father stopping him and asking him what he was busy with. Bell pointed at the girl and gasped, "I want to invite her to listen to Mother play the piano." His father sternly stopped him, saying, "Don't do that! Why are you playing jokes on people for no reason? Don't you know she's deaf?" Bell asked in surprise, "Why can't deaf people listen to the piano?" Only then did his father realize that his son didn't know that deaf people couldn't hear, so he changed his tone and told him gently, "Son, it's not that I won't let deaf people listen to the piano, it's just that deaf people have problems with their ears and can't hear. She can't just not hear the piano; she can't hear any sounds. Because deaf people have lost their hearing, they can't learn to speak, so a deaf person who is deaf from an early age is also a mute who cannot speak." Bell felt very sad after hearing his father's words and always thought, "How can I find a way to make deaf people hear and mutes speak?" Later, whenever and wherever Bell saw someone bullying a deaf person, he would definitely come forward to help them and do his best to protect them? It was as if all the deaf people in the world were his good friends. His love grew day by day, and he naturally became a gentleman with benevolence and righteousness. This matter greatly helped his future invention career.</p>
<p>When Bell reached school age, his father sent him to school. At that time, he still paid close attention to various sounds. He loved to listen carefully to whatever he heard. Living next to Bell was a family that made a living by grinding flour. Every day when Bell went to school, he always liked to stand at the door of their house and listen to the sound of the waterwheel grinding flour for a while. Several years passed in this way without him realizing it. One morning, Bell passed by there again as usual, but he couldn't hear the sound he expected. He was very surprised, so he put his ear close to the door and heard someone crying inside. He knew that someone must have been wronged, and he was anxious to know what had happened so that he could find a way to help. He knocked on the door a few times, but no one answered him, so he had to push the door open and go in. He saw an old man with completely white hair lying on the stone mill, sobbing softly. Bell took off his hat, walked up to him, and said respectfully, "Sir, please forgive me for coming in without your permission. I am a young man who lives not far from here, and I have a responsibility to help you with everything. Please tell me your grievance!"</p>
<p>The old man raised his head, saw a strange child standing in front of him saying such things, and felt it was so ridiculous that he almost burst into laughter. But he was suddenly moved by Bell's sincere attitude, knew that Bell's intention was genuine, and couldn't help but shed tears of gratitude. He frankly told Bell, "Young man, my matter is not something a child can help with. But since you are willing to know, I can tell you my difficulties. If you can help, I will be just as grateful to you. I am already seventy-three years old this year and only have a twenty-three-year-old son. We make a living by grinding flour. When my son is at home, he does all the work. I didn't expect my son to be drafted into the army recently. Now I am left alone at home to grind flour to make a living." The old man pointed to the waterwheel as he spoke and said, "With water, the wheel can move, and I can barely manage to grind flour. But now the weather is dry, and there is little water, so the wheel won't move. I see that I have no way to grind flour and will surely starve to death. Thinking about it, the days ahead are really hard." Bell comforted him, "This is easy to solve; I'll help you grind flour."</p>
<p>Bell hurried back to school, immediately found a group of children, told them about this matter, stirred them up with righteousness, and agreed with them to help the old man grind flour every day. The children thought that grinding flour was also a fun thing, so they all agreed. Sure enough, the next day many children came to help. With many people and great strength, the mill could move even without water. After some days, the children all felt that grinding flour was a monotonous and boring thing. One of the leaders refused to come, and everyone avoided it completely. In the end, only Bell was left to grind flour for the old man. Bell tried his best, so anxious that tears and sweat flowed non-stop, but he couldn't get the mill to move. He said goodbye to the old man with shame and went home, quietly slipped into his father's study, and thought hard about a way to help. After a while, he guessed in his heart, "The mill must be so hard to move because its friction is too great. If I can find a way to reduce the friction, it should be very easy to move." He forgot to eat and sleep, and after a month of effort, he finally created a design for an improved mortar, so that the molar teeth and white teeth were connected snugly to reduce friction, and he also used round wheat grains to rub against each other, reducing the turning force of grinding the white. He took the design to teach the craftsmen to remodel the new white and improve the old mortar. As a result, the new mill was very convenient to use, and it could be moved without the help of water, with just the strength of an old man or a child. From then on, not only was this old man's difficulty solved, but all the people who relied on grinding flour for a living were blessed by Bell.</p>
<p>After graduating from middle school, Bell went to the University of Edinburgh to study acoustics. Later, he went to the University of London to study and also worked as his father's assistant. Bearing in mind his childhood love for the deaf, Bell paid great attention to the education of the deaf. At the age of twenty-one, he went to teach at a school for the deaf and mute. He worked very hard on his research, hoping to invent a tool that could teach his deaf and mute students to pronounce correctly. Unfortunately, while he was engrossed in his research, both of his brothers died of lung disease in London. His father was afraid that Bell would also contract the deadly lung disease, so he immediately asked him to go to Canada. There, Bell became famous for his efforts, and the following year, Boston University hired him as a professor.</p>
<p>At that time, newspapers had already been published, but there were no telephones. Bell believed that sound waves could also be transmitted through wires to create a telephone. Because he did not understand electricity, he did not dare to draw a conclusion, so he specially went to Washington to consult a famous electrical technician. After listening to Bell's words, the technician laughed impolitely, "Your belief that sound waves can be transmitted through wires is entirely because you do not understand electricity. If you had even a little knowledge of electricity, you would not make such an absurd argument." Bell was embarrassed and did not dare to say more, so he went home and concentrated on studying electricity. After two years of study, he became even more determined in his belief that sound waves could be transmitted through wires. He decided to invent a telephone, but he did not understand the technology of manufacturing machinery, so he knew that he had to find an assistant who was proficient in mechanics. After searching for many days, he finally found Thomas A. Watson. They decided to devote all their efforts to inventing the telephone, so Bell resigned from his professorship and worked day and night with Watson in the laboratory. Whenever they made a breakthrough in their research, they often stayed up for days to pursue the results. After another two years, they finally invented the telephone. Bell was very happy and donated all the money he made from the sale of the telephone to schools for the deaf and mute. At this time, Bell was only twenty-nine years old, and Watson was only twenty-one years old.</p>
<p>The following year, Bell married a deaf woman, and the couple went to England and France for their honeymoon with beaming smiles. Afterwards, he promoted the use of the telephone on the one hand and sought happiness for the deaf and mute on the other. He often donated all the money he earned, no matter how much, to help deaf and mute education. Throughout his life, he devoted his efforts to using scientific methods to help deaf and mute people have the ability to hear and speak, and he also enabled people who were not deaf or mute to talk to each other across thousands of miles.</p>

<h3>How to Cultivate an Academic Atmosphere (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Hanmei</p>
<p>Elementary school students are not yet aware of human affairs, so let us not discuss them. However, general middle school and university students should have some awareness and strive for self-improvement, but they do not. We should not say that middle school and university students are not diligent in self-exhortation, but rather that the social environment and school conditions determine this. They see that society's employment of young people does not focus on true talent and practical knowledge, but rather on flowery writing and academic qualifications. Therefore, reading in school only requires passing grades and obtaining a diploma. Is it not foolish to study diligently? As for the possibility of obtaining flowery writing in the future, that is very uncertain, so why bother with it? This is the biggest reason why the social environment determines that they do not study. At the same time, in general schools today, not to mention how many students are truly dedicated to studying, how many are truly dedicated to running the school? Taking Shanghai as an example, there are many "commercial educators" who use education to make money and treat students as commodities. Can we still talk about the superficiality of the academic atmosphere in such schools and such education? As for the public schools with excellent achievements, I am afraid they are also rare.</p>
<p>Everything is trapped in an abnormal state in China. Right and wrong are not distinguished, merits and demerits are not clear, rewards and punishments are not clear. The academic atmosphere is declining day by day. In the future, those who are boastful and good at flattering, without learning or skill, will be all over the country. This is all within our expectations and is not at all surprising. Therefore, it is not a task that can be accomplished overnight, nor is it a matter of swift and forceful measures, to correct this phenomenon. We must have a plan that addresses the shortcomings of the times. Now, let me describe the author's methods for cultivating a national academic atmosphere, in order to seek the correction of enlightened readers!</p>
<p>First, implement a nationwide examination system. The author's ideal ultimate goal is to implement an examination system in every occupational group. Regardless of job application or promotion, academic knowledge, talent, and work performance must be the absolute criteria. However, this method cannot be achieved overnight and should be promoted gradually. The first step is to start with various government agencies. All public servants at all levels should undergo strict, fair, and impartial examinations before being hired or promoted. In this way, not only will administrative efficiency be promoted automatically, but the trend of seeking advancement through personal connections can also be curbed to some extent. After the government agencies have been successfully promoted, the government should use its power to implement this system in various occupational groups for senior officials. It is necessary to achieve the goals of "everyone uses their talents to the fullest" and "applying what they have learned" nationwide. Then the academic atmosphere in society can be cultivated, and the academic atmosphere in schools can be even more intense.</p>
<p>Second, the government and society should actively encourage academics. The governance of a country depends on clear right and wrong and fair rewards and punishments; the chaos of society is due to the inversion of right and wrong and unclear rewards and punishments. An enlightened government should not relax its negative work, and should pay close attention to its positive encouragement. It must be known that moral governance and legal governance complement each other and cannot be ignored. China is indeed poor, but a small amount of money for academic expenses can always be included in one or two out of ten million in the budget; to take a step back, a large sum of Boxer Indemnity funds should be used for academic encouragement. However, we only hear about the state subsidizing education funds, which only completed the magnificent school buildings of several public middle schools and universities; the Boxer Indemnity funds seem to be squandered and wasted by the children of the nouveau riche; we have never heard of active and practical regulations or measures to encourage academics. Those who are diligent and eager to learn, and those who are devoted to their work, cannot obtain security in life, nor can they obtain assistance from society, let alone rewards from the government. The decline of customs and the evil of human nature have their own origins! Therefore, I believe that the government and society's encouragement of academics is an urgent matter.</p>
<p>The organization of a society has a close interrelationship, just like the gears in a clock. Efforts in one area are often twice as effective with half the effort. Only by advancing together can we achieve twice the result with half the effort. The decline of the publishing industry is not so much due to the lack of effort of those engaged in the publishing industry as it is an inevitable reflection of the abnormal state of society!</p>
<h3>Several Weekly Magazines</h3>
<p>— Ling Guang</p>
<p>Speaking of the current publishing industry in Shanghai, it is impossible not to acknowledge the prosperity of weekly magazines; we can say that this phenomenon has a subtle relationship with the decline in readers' purchasing power. It is true that weekly magazines are publications that fall between daily newspapers, semi-monthly magazines, and monthly magazines. In recent years, due to the domestic situation, the various humorous and not entirely accurate news in daily newspapers have caused everyone to feel depressed; what about semi-monthly and monthly magazines? They are mostly filled with lengthy treatises, which are not the focus of one's research, and everyone feels a headache. Weekly magazines fall in between these two, with content that tends to be popular and general; in addition, they offer concise explanations of current events, and the essays are short and pithy, so they are undoubtedly welcomed by the general public.</p>
<p>The appearance of weekly magazines in the publishing industry dates back more than a decade to "Saturday," but although this publication is still continuing to be published to this day, few people pay attention to it, and I do not wish to discuss it here. Clever readers can judge its right and wrong for themselves. However, the publication that gave the publishing industry an impetus was the appearance of "Life Weekly." The editor, Mr. Zou Taofen, was like a stimulant doctor, desperately injecting morphine needles into the general public, and was therefore able to attract nearly seventy to eighty thousand readers. Now let's talk about several weekly magazines that have been recently published in Shanghai:</p>
<p>Shen Bao Weekly This is a weekly magazine that is included with the Shen Bao newspaper. Its predecessor was the Shen Bao Monthly. Its content focuses on systematic explanations of current events and introductions to the customs and folklore of various places. It can be said to be a bit more intellectual compared to many weekly magazines. It does not have anesthetizing commentaries, but rather insightful "small words." "Weekly Current Events" provides an analysis of the week's current events, which is naturally more detailed than the mere recording in daily newspapers; although some people say that it is only because it is the Shen Bao Weekly, supplementing the deficiencies of the daily newspaper, that there are articles that analyze current events. In fact, because it is a weekly magazine, it should publish more time-sensitive things. I say that this kind of analysis of current events is a task that every weekly magazine should have. In addition, each issue has articles on international affairs, politics, economics, as well as novels, essays, and miscellaneous writings. Although it lacks a bit of liveliness in the editing, it is still a high-level reading material.</p>
<p>Xin Ren Weekly "Xin Ren Weekly" has been published for about two years now. From the second volume onwards, it has been edited by Mr. Zhou Hanmei. The articles in the weekly forum are very capable of arousing the resonance of the general public. However, what I regret is the lack of articles on international affairs, politics, and economics, which is something that this publication should pay attention to. In recent issues, there have been many introductions to Japanese customs, people, politics, etc., which can indeed attract the attention of the current young people. In addition, they also have "Major and Minor Events at Home and Abroad," "Cultural Reports," "Character Biographies," "Real Life Experiences," and "Literary Creations," and each issue has articles that are worth reading. Recently, each issue has sold as many as thirty to forty thousand copies, which is indeed its content guaranteeing its development.</p>
<p>Finally, I feel that the books and newspapers of "Xin Ren" should strive for a bit more timeliness, although this is a common problem of general publications, but we must hold the organizers of "Xin Ren" more accountable.</p>
<p>Zhongguo Xuesheng (Chinese Students) Seeing its name, we know that its target audience is students. That's right, this is indeed something that general students should read. Each issue has "Commentary," "Current Affairs Lectures," communications and news about students, "Overseas News" and "Literature," etc. Not only is the content considerable, but the writing is also very substantial. The layout is also very beautiful, which is worth mentioning. Here, I would especially recommend it to all Chinese students.</p>
<p>Ren Yan Weekly It seems that the form determines the content. It is still printed in old No. 5 font, which is too cumbersome. For this weekly magazine, whether it is the content or the form, I really dare not flatter it, and even the very beautiful photogravure pictorial has photos that have lost their timeliness.</p>
<p>Han Xue Zhou Kan (Sweat and Blood Weekly) This is a very beautifully printed weekly magazine. From the books and newspapers to the writing inside, everything shows its magnificence, but regrettably, the articles inside are too lacking in brilliance, which should be noted by its organizers.</p>
<p>Yongsheng (Eternal Life) This is a weekly magazine that inherited from "Dazhong Shenghuo (Public Life)," as everyone knows. It is precisely because "Dazhong Shenghuo" was banned that the content of "Yongsheng" has also changed slightly, but on the whole, it is still the same as before. What should be mentioned here is the current affairs chart, which is indeed worth reading. Recently, it has also added "China and the World Weekly," which analyzes events, which is also very good.</p>
<p>Here, I have provided some simple criticisms of several weekly magazines published in Shanghai. At the same time, I must also state that the so-called criticisms here are actually just the author's impressions. I can only sincerely pray that the editors of all weekly magazines in Shanghai and even the whole country will strive to review their own content and fully assume the mission of educating the public.</p>
<h3>My Reading Experience (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Du Xiu</p>
<p>I have been struggling in society for eight years. Before entering society, I also received formal school education, going through three stages: elementary school, middle school, and university. I read books during my school days, and I continued to read books while serving in society. After reading books for twenty-four years, I now recall that I am truly ashamed and frustrated.</p>
<p>I think it's not just me who has such a painful past, right? I'm afraid that many people will have the same sadness as me. Although I have read books for more than twenty years, it's like stumbling blindly in a vast desert, or like a small boat that has lost its compass in a sea of knowledge, drifting up and down. So after sailing for more than twenty years, I can't talk about any destination, let alone any academic achievements. In the process of going through elementary, middle, and high schools, the teachers didn't have lessons to guide reading; while serving in society, there were many bad environments and bad stimuli that tempted you away from your books. Now, describing my reading experience is truly full of emotion and heartache!</p>

<h3>An Effective Medicine for Treating Stubborn Ringworm and Malignant Sores</h3>
<p>— (Ji Chang)</p>
<p>There are many external medicines for treating skin diseases. Their efficacy also varies, with some being superior and others being inferior. If the selection is not done properly, not only will their effectiveness not be evident, but they may also have adverse effects. For example, if one wants to reduce inflammation but the inflammation worsens, or if one wants to relieve itching but the itching becomes more severe. Therefore, attention must be paid to the selection of medicines. The principle of external medicines for treating skin diseases is to have a deep-penetrating effect without harming the human body. Because of the protective effect of the stratum corneum of the epidermis, the skin does not allow medicines to penetrate. If the ingredients are of high quality and the formulation is appropriate, the epidermal cells will gradually be infiltrated, the connections between the cells will be loosened, and the effect of the medicines can penetrate deep inside. "Gan Lu" medicated water, issued by Tongren Western Pharmacy, No. 1 Dexing Lane, West Xinqiao Street, French Concession, Shanghai, is remarkably effective in penetrating deeply. It kills insects and bacteria, detoxifies and removes pus, relieves itching and reduces inflammation. It is effective in treating various stubborn ringworms, scabies, sores, eczema, carbuncles, dampness, and other skin diseases. The quick recovery is also due to the fact that the raw materials used are all top-grade, and the manufacturing method is in accordance with pharmaceutical principles. Therefore, its color and smell are clear, fragrant, and lovely, which is truly its specialty. (Note: The price of each bottle of "Gan Lu" is one yuan.)</p>
<h3>On Stomach Diseases</h3>
<p>— (Zhen Bang)</p>
<p>It is a natural and universally known truth that a strong stomach leads to a strong body, and a sick stomach leads to a weak body. The stomach is the sea of water and grains and the organ of digestion. It is located in the abdominal cavity below the diaphragm, connected to the esophagus above and to the small intestine below. When food enters the mouth and reaches the stomach through the esophagus, the stomach begins to peristaltic, secreting gastric juice to digest the food into chyme, which flows into the small intestine. The intestinal mucosa selects and absorbs its nutrients and transports them to the cells of various organs and tissues throughout the body. The useless waste is then sent to the large intestine and excreted through the anus. Therefore, we need regular food, regular digestion, regular absorption, and regular excretion in order to maintain life and strengthen the body. If the stomach becomes diseased, the functions of digestion, absorption, and excretion will be impaired. Nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, fullness, indigestion, acid reflux, heartburn, anemia, dizziness, abdominal distension, and constipation are all the main symptoms of stomach disease and its secondary symptoms. It is impossible to have a strong body in such a state. Therefore, there is nothing better than having few desires to nourish the heart, and there is nothing better than having a healthy stomach to prolong life. Recently, Tongren Western Pharmacy, No. 1 Dexing Lane, West Xinqiao Street, French Concession, Shanghai, has used its years of research experience to produce a kind of "Wei Bi Ling" medicinal powder, which specializes in treating stomach diseases. I have used it in clinical practice and have repeatedly achieved special effects. It is truly a savior for those suffering from stomach diseases and an essential product for health experts. Each box is sold for one silver dollar.</p>
<h3>Facial Protection Method</h3>
<p>— (Jin Shen)</p>
<p>The face is the exterior of a person. It changes its appearance from childhood to adulthood, following the years. Although natural physiological functions are the master, it is not impossible to control it through artificial protection. Clothes protect the body, and hair protects the head. However, because the five senses are located on the face, it must be directly exposed to benefit its functions. Therefore, it is exposed to wind and sun, and is invaded by dust and sand and infected with bacteria. There are often opportunities for the skin of the face to be damaged. Therefore, many people suffer from freckles, rice lumps, and acne. Once they are infected, they damage the appearance and increase pain and itching. Therefore, the face must be given appropriate protection. That is, wash and rub the face with cold or warm water every morning and evening. After wiping it dry, apply "Mian Li" evenly. It has the effect of killing bacteria, removing dirt, tenderizing the skin, and beautifying the face. It can prevent facial diseases before they occur, and quickly heal freckles, rice lumps, and acne that have already developed. It is the simplest, easiest to implement, appropriate, and effective method.</p>
<h3>Sequelae of Quitting Smoking</h3>
<p>— (Yuyuan)</p>
<p>Quitting smoking is not difficult. What is difficult is the proper handling of the sequelae. The so-called sequelae are the symptoms that appear near the end of the quitting process, or after one has already quit. Among the most frequently encountered, the most prominent is neurasthenia. Its symptoms are quite complex. Of these, seminal emission and insomnia are the most likely to cause alarm among those quitting. Therefore, during the quitting period, those administering the cessation should take these into consideration in advance, using drastic astringent medicines to stop emission, and anesthetic or sedative products to induce sleep. While these may be effective temporarily, prolonged use can lead to chronic poisoning, which is the fault of the physician. This is why formal medical practitioners do not adopt them. However, 'Xirukang' pills are particularly effective in treating neurasthenia. Their therapeutic ability regarding seminal emission and insomnia is especially natural and physiological. Continuous use does not lead to addiction. Taking them during the quitting period can prevent the onset of sequelae. Taking them after the onset of seminal emission and insomnia after quitting has a definite therapeutic effect. It is hoped that those quitting smoking will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note: 'Xirukang' is indeed uniquely effective in treating neurasthenia. This medicine is sold by the Tongren Western Pharmacy at No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, Fada Road, Shanghai. The price is two yuan per bottle.)</p>
<h3>Examination of Treatments for Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— (Renjun)</p>
<p>Among common infectious diseases, gonorrhea has the most widespread dissemination, the longest duration, and the most difficult treatment. Because gonorrhea is difficult to treat, there are many methods of treatment. In other words, there are a great many medicines for treating this disease. Various types of injectable solutions are inconvenient for patients, so they have to resort to oral medications. But there are hundreds of such oral medications. How should we treat diseases? First, we must consider whether the drugs used are all high-quality and reliable. If good medicines are used, then the desire for recovery is no longer a problem. Among the oral medicines currently seen on the market, only "Gonadoton" pills can be considered effective. This is because the drug has a great ability to decompose and spread within the body, and its penetrating power into the lesion mucosa is especially great. Its effects, such as promoting urination, killing bacteria, relieving pain, and reducing inflammation, are also distinctly different from other drugs. Whether it is subacute, acute, or stubborn chronic, it can achieve radical cure. (Note: 'Gonadoton' sells for two yuan per box. It is sold by the Tongren Western Pharmacy at No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, Fada Road, Shanghai.)</p>
<h3>Excellent Remedy for Leukorrhea, Treating Both Internally and Externally</h3>
<p>— (Yiqun)</p>
<p>"Internal Leukorrhea Pills" and "External Leukorrhea Medicine" are famous gynecological medicines exclusively sold by Tongren Western Pharmacy, No. 1 Dexing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, Fada Road, Shanghai. They are specialized in treating new and old red and white leukorrhea in women. The effect is especially great. It has a miraculous effect, especially on gonorrheal leukorrhea. Women suffering from simple leukorrhea or gonorrheal leukorrhea without treatment can only take these two medicines. They are all effective in eliminating the disease. We have repeatedly tested them in clinical practice without failure. For internal use, take two pills each time, three times a day, priced at two yuan per box. For external use, it is a vaginal suppository, use one piece every night, also priced at two yuan per box. Treating both internally and externally, the speed of efficacy is also a matter of course. This is published to contribute to the female patients.</p>

However, my two-year-old child has wet poison all over his body, with dripping mucus. Some say it is fetal toxin, and others say it is scabies. I don't know which one is correct. Can I still use 'Ganlu' to apply it? (Zhang Jing'an asks)</p>
<p>(Answer) Ganlu lotion can be applied to all skin diseases. The efficacy is indeed effective and miraculous. For young children, the lotion can be diluted with boiled water (about half) before applying it. It is safer.</p>
<p>New Medicine for Treating Spots</p>
<p>It is most regrettable to have freckles on the face. This is true for both men and women. Although there are many spot-treating drugs on the market, few are effective. I don't know if there is a new medicine for treating freckles that can turn ugliness into beauty. (Yan Minqiu asks)</p>
<p>(Answer) Freckles are indeed an obstacle to beauty. 'Face Beauty' cream has the effect of removing them.</p>
<p>Years of Old Turbidity</p>
<p>I had one extramarital affair and have been sick for ten years. It recurs repeatedly. Everyone says that old turbidity is difficult to eradicate. Now I see in the newspaper that "Gonadoton" pills have a rapid effect. I don't know if it is true. (Guo Xinqiu asks)</p>
<p>(Answer) Tongren Western Pharmacy in this city sells 'Gonadoton' pills. It is indeed very effective in treating various types of gonorrhea. You can go and buy it. It will surely have a quick and complete effect. The price is two yuan per box.</p>

<h3>Is This How Punishment is Dealt With?</h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>According to recent news reports, two county magistrates in Zhejiang Province have been disciplined. One is Luo Zhongda, the magistrate of Chongde County, Zhejiang, who was impeached by the supervisory court, and the central disciplinary conference decided to remove him from office and suspend him from employment for two years. The second is Zhang Baozhen, the magistrate of Tiantai County, Zhejiang, who was also impeached by the supervisory committee, and the central disciplinary conference decided to demote him by two grades and change his assessment. These two county magistrates are also unlucky. Not only have they lost a small reputation, but the sacrifice of their reputation can never be washed away by the water of the West River.</p>
<p>Let's examine the reasons for the dismissal and change of assessment of the two county magistrates. One charge is accepting bribes and dividing the spoils, conniving with bandits and harming the people, detaining innocent people, and accepting bribes to change the verdict. The other charge is conniving with bandits to burn and kill, and arbitrarily arresting and fining people. May I ask if such charges are only dealt with by dismissal and change of assessment, it is unavoidable to look at the official rank too heavily and the people's lives too lightly. Judging from these two charges, the people who have been poisoned by the two county magistrates during their tenure are already countless. Now, lightly dealing with it by dismissal and change of assessment, I am afraid that the people will still inevitably feel some regret.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the National Government, it has been strictly enforcing honest politics. However, even now, this trend of corruption is still prevalent. The lack of strict methods for punishing officials is probably also one of the reasons? If an official is in office, no matter how he embezzles and perverts the law, commits adultery and commits crimes, if he is not discovered, he can do whatever he wants without any scruples. If he is discovered, he will only lose his official position, and that's it. There is nothing great. If this is the case, officials are too cheap and the people are too miserable. Moreover, one is suspended from employment for two years, and can still be employed after two years. The other is demoted by two grades, and can still be a small official. If the means are clever, he can restore his old rank in an instant, while the trauma suffered by the people of that place will remain forever.</p>
<p>Furthermore, examining the charges, conniving with bandits to burn and kill, and arbitrarily arresting innocent people, are such cruel actions. They are truly heinous. Not to mention those who have suffered the disaster, it is unimaginable. Even people in other places, when they hear about it, are already frightened and angry. But the result is just like this, which cannot help but make people sigh. In the feudal era, it was common for officials to protect each other. Since the revolution, this kind of malpractice has been eliminated for a long time. However, a kind of hereditary nature has not been eradicated, so the poison of harming the people still remains in various places.</p>
<p>The Administrative Yuan issued a circular to all agencies a few days ago, strictly investigating corruption, and listed ten items, with a deadline for filling out the report. Under an honest government, there should naturally be such strict sanctions. However, the results of the report are still good. This situation can be expected early. After all, when political facilities have not been perfected, the current situation is like this. If you want to truly strictly investigate whether officials are corrupt, you can never just settle it with a piece of paper. You must send special commissioners to secretly investigate their governance in various places from time to time, and listen to the general word-of-mouth of the local people. This is not enough to get the truth of corruption. If the case is reported by the people, the authorities send someone to investigate. During this period, the county magistrate has already been able to use his means of concealment, and the truth has become difficult to understand.</p>

<h3>Welcoming the Holy Mother</h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>Welcoming the Holy Mother can probably only be seen at Yu Mountain. Sheshan is one of the nine peaks of Jiangnan, and is only twelve miles away from Songjiang. There are churches built by the husband and wife church on the mountain. After more than fifty years of operation, the lush forests and bamboos have become somewhat scenic. Every year in May, as usual, a decision is made to welcome the Holy Mother. If the Catholics from far and near can spare the time, they will go to Sheshan to pray and make a decision.</p>
<p>However, welcoming the Holy Mother is in the morning. There are no hotels in Sheshan, and the night before welcoming the Holy Mother is an unprecedentedly lively time; so if you want to see welcoming the Holy Mother, it is best to hire a boat the night before, so you can rest in the boat. If you are close to Sheshan, then you can go early in the morning or go by boat, and you can still see it, but on the day of welcoming the Holy Mother, if the weather is bad and it rains, then it will have to be postponed.</p>
<p>It is only seven or eight miles from our hometown to Yu Mountain, and it takes less than an hour to get there, and walking is much faster than by boat. When we arrived at Sheshan, we saw the white churches showing through the green trees and bamboos from a distance. The sound of people was so familiar that you could hear it from a distance. In the small river around the mountain, the boats were parked so tightly that they blocked the road. Among the tens of millions of boats of different sizes, there were especially many rice boats and fishing boats, because there are many Catholics among the people who sell rice and fish!</p>
<p>At the front gate of the mountain, the vendors who were catching up with the festival set up cloth sheds and were selling food and toys. There were so many people that it was so crowded that it was like a theater! The sky was about to get dark. Entering the mountain gate, the road was very wide, a section of sandy road, with several layers of stone steps in the middle, so it was as flat as the ground and very easy to walk. The top was covered by leaves and bamboo leaves, so you couldn't see the sky and you couldn't see the sun and moon. Next to the road, every dozen steps or so, a red and green lantern was hung, and candles were lit together. In the walkway, you could occasionally see Westerners setting off red foreign fireworks.</p>
<p>Arriving at Zhongshan, there is a church here, and in front of it is an open space, which is also full of lanterns. The church is full of Catholics, chanting scriptures? Around it are hung embroidered flags and banners. On the opposite side of the church, in the green trees and bamboos, there are several statues of gods. The Catholics are kneeling in front of the statues of gods to pray, and even more lanterns are set up here. This can be said to be the essence of the whole mountain and the most lively place.</p>
<p>Walking up the stone steps again, to the top of the mountain, there is another church, and the Yu Mountain Observatory is also behind the church. When going down the mountain, there is another road, which is concave, called the Sutra Fold Road. At each corner, there is a Suffering Road Pavilion, a total of ten, symbolizing Jesus' ten trials and tribulations. The highest point is the Cross Pavilion. When Catholics go up the mountain, everyone must kneel in front of each Suffering Road and chant scriptures and pray.</p>
<p>From about eight o'clock, on the open space of Jinshan, in front of the statue, the lights were all lit up. People who were watching the excitement gathered there at this time. Military bands, Qingyin bands, Chinese and Western music, started and stopped, and then played together in succession? There was also a performance by the Boy Scouts of a certain church school. In the deep mountains and valleys, to have such a carnival is also a different kind of mood. However, women are not allowed to go up the mountain this night. It is said that women used to look good, but because something happened one year, several women were teased and seduced by bad guys, so women are no longer allowed to go up the mountain to watch the excitement on the night before welcoming the Holy Mother.</p>
<p>After the excitement, people all went down the mountain together, anyway, there were many people who went to Chenfangqiao that night! We squeezed into the crowd, wearing the stars and the moon, and after two miles of night walking, we arrived at the town of Chenfangqiao. There were especially many people in that town that night. The teahouses were full, and the sound of playing cards filled the air. As a result, we found friends and stayed overnight in a foreign goods store, but they had no extra beds, so we borrowed two quilts and rested on the counter for the night.</p>
<p>When I got up the next day, the road was already wet. It had obviously rained again last night, but fortunately it was clearing up now. After eating some breakfast, I immediately went to Yu Mountain, because welcoming the Holy Mother was about to begin at eight o'clock. The muddy road after the rain was so rotten that it was difficult to walk. It was easy to fall. When I arrived at Sheshan, people were pouring up the mountain like a tide. Now women can also go up the mountain and are not prohibited.</p>
<p>At this time, the sound of cannons and bells on the top of the mountain were being fired in succession, and even people in distant houses could hear them faintly. The Holy Mother is in Zhongshan, and she is welcomed to the hall on the top of the mountain. We stood in a place in the crowd in Zhongshan and on the way up the mountain to watch. In the walkway, people were constantly going up or down the mountain.</p>
<p>Welcoming the Holy Mother has begun. In the midst of the noise of people</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>, I suddenly saw the Taoists of Zhongshan coming up. Flags and umbrellas led the way, the military band, the Qingyin band, were all solemnly walking up the mountain slowly, playing Chinese and Western music, and finally came the statue of the Holy Mother, carried up the mountain by eight priests in white clothes. The excitement of welcoming the Holy Mother is such a scene. What is the difference from the race meeting?</p>
<p>After the Holy Mother was welcomed up the mountain, everything was over. People immediately poured down the mountain like a tide. Those with boats returned to their boats, and those without boats went home. If you go to Sheshan again on this night, the front mountain gate will be tightly closed, all the stalls will be cleared away, and most of the boats in the river will have left. Wait until next May, and then come and make a decision on the same excitement.</p>
<h3>Mountain</h3>
<p>— Dingchang</p>
<p>——In memory of my father——</p>
<p>After spending four whole years of wandering outside, I was simply like a wave in the sea, stirred up by a hurricane, turning, tearing, and rushing towards the unknown distance.</p>
<p>The days turned in my gloomy dreams.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I wandered on the streets on a quiet night, using tired steps to measure the dangers in the darkness; or when everything around was immersed in silent silence, I got up from the bed and wandered in the dim, narrow room, gently pushing open the window, I looked into the distance, ah, a gray night, flashing with bright spots of fire. The stars narrowed their eyes, and the flowing clouds were the traces of my travelers, ah—— The sad taste invaded my heart. So, I became depressed and suffered from the distant homesickness.</p>
<h3>The Moving Home</h3>
<p>— Written by Chen Haoxiong</p>
<p>There is no family more lonely in the world than mine.</p>
<p>I, far away at this post station in a foreign land, only think of my mother and younger brother, who are struggling under the oppression of disasters and trapped by hunger, with lonely longing. Other than that, what power do I have to compensate for the ardent hopes of the beautiful dreams they once had for me! I have never had the courage to send them a letter asking what step their lives have been forced to. It's just like I've never had the courage to ask myself what step my life will take tomorrow.</p>
<p>It was one autumn night that I will never forget in my memory, our whole family was scattered by the sound of guns in the attack on the city by the ×× soldiers. Running blindly, in the rich fields full of sorghum, in the dense forests covered with leaves, some voices, mixed with some crying, began.</p>
<p>I don't know where my mother and younger brother fled to. I held my father's arm and staggered through a deep valley. The night air was already a bit cold. When my father was too tired to take another step forward, he finally climbed out of the valley, but it was still a very high, very high mountain. My father said despairingly and sadly: "Don't climb, even if you climb until dawn, it's still a mountain... Let's spend the night here..."</p>
<p>In this way, we groped to a place covered with fallen leaves, and lay down on the ground to have terrifying dreams. I looked at the woods from time to time, and listened to the distance from time to time; the sound of guns, artillery fire, and people's voices shattered my heart! I thought to myself: the city is destroyed! My father seemed to be sleeping quietly, but suddenly, he trembled, then got up, and murmured sadly: "Your mother and your younger brother, they, they, alas..."</p>
<p>It dawned.</p>
<p>The gray sky was drizzling. The fallen leaves in the autumn mountains were all yellow. The mountains with undulating peaks blocked our view. We couldn't see a small village. The surroundings were full of desolation. We moved our feet again to another place. After walking a few steps, my father tilted his head and said to me: "I'm afraid I've caught a cold. My head is dizzy and painful. My chest is also jumping and jumping with pain!"</p>
<p>"Find a family to sleep well," I comforted him."</p>
<p>On another mountain, my mother and younger brother, and several neighbors, met us.</p>
<p>After half a month of fleeing in the mountains, we returned to the city. Everything we had was burned down.</p>
<p>My father was sick.</p>
<p>Soon, I also walked out of the house.</p>
<p>In the autumn of a year later, I actually returned home.</p>
<p>My mother cried and complained to me: "You, you have been living outside for a year and you haven't sent a letter. Your father's illness is also very serious. He misses you so much, saying nonsense all day and night, always saying: what do I need a son for, he doesn't even come back to see me when I'm sick..." Wiping her tears, she sobbed again: "What are you doing outside anyway? You don't send money home, and none of the debts at home have been paid back. You, you, you can bring back this time..."</p>
<p>Sweat immediately filled my face. A layer of gray shadow covered my eyes. I sadly did not answer my mother a word from beginning to end.</p>
<p>My family had no way to keep me, a wanderer in the wilderness. A month of boring family life like imprisonment had already tormented my heart to the point of coldness. So, I quietly embarked on my journey.</p>
<p>Who knew that not long after I left home, my father died.</p>
<p>Now, when I recall the mountains of my hometown that my father had walked through during his escape, at this time, it should already be full of sparks of explosion?</p>
<h3>Twilight</h3>
<p>— Yan Ting</p>
<p>Twilight.</p>
<p>The evening mist has already shrouded the distant mountains, and a rainbow is smearing across half the sky.</p>
<p>At this time, on the road leading to Vikpu Village, a vast and silent village road, a person is walking with his weary and exhausted steps. He is an old man approaching fifty years of age, wearing a set of dirty old sailor's clothing, with his beard and hair completely white. His face is very dignified and melancholic. Apart from the white canvas bag he is carrying on his back and the wooden staff in his hand, he is carrying nothing else. He came from Vikpu.</p>
<p>When he stopped at a small cigarette shop outside the village to rest, and tossed a plump little woman in the shop a ten-cent silver coin for a pack of cigarettes, he introduced himself in a sighing tone:</p>
<p>"Ah, old woman, is it far to go to Linsark Village, I wonder? (In fact, the village is right in front of him)" The little woman in the cigarette shop looked at him with surprised eyes. "I am an old sailor, and it has been fifteen years since I returned home!..." The little woman nodded silently. He did not linger there for long, then carried the canvas bag and moved forward towards the village.</p>
<p>This village, fifteen years ago, was his home, a prominent fishing village, with its back against the mountains and its face towards the vast sea. At that time, he was still a strong middle-aged man. Because the fishing season was approaching, he had to depart with his Mary Queen. In the embraces of his beautiful, young wife and ten-year-old daughter, the sea separated them with its rough and solemn voice, leaving a permanent water barrier between them. Due to encountering terrible storms along the way, more than thirty skilled sailors were actually unable to control this roaring beast, causing it to recklessly collapse towards the edge of the vast and boundless sea along with the underwater currents. In the end, they were discovered in a strange, foreign land; and for the sake of survival, they had to abandon navigation and do some rough work for others to make a living. Now, he is back. The sea has separated him from his home for fifteen years, and his hometown has also separated him from him for fifteen years. However, he has not forgotten that he is a good sailor. He is wearing sailor's clothes (although they are so old and dirty): he has not forgotten his hometown and his home: he has returned. He is now so old, and he believes that this village, which once knew him so well and nurtured him as he grew up, has also become older than before. He thought: Liss must have become old, and he does not know how Green Dye has grown. Perhaps she is already</p>
