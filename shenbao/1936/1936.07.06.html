<p>華聯社特稿英人愛麥尼氏、在其新著原料戰術一書中、列舉近代資本主義國家所不可缺少之原料共廿二種之中、日本僅有石炭·硫黃·鎘·鎢·雲母石等五種、勉强可以自給、其他如最主要之羊毛·棉花·及鐵·石油等、大部份或全部份均依存於外國的輸入、如貿易表所示、此項重要之原料、均佔全輸入量之六成、因此、一遇外國實行對日輸出禁止、或貿易上發生故障、卽可使日本上產業上及軍事上受到重大在打擊、於是、日本政府乃加緊對華侵略、推行南進政策、藉以補救此種缺憾、例如羊毛在去年度一億九千一百萬、因自對澳通商决裂以後、大受影響、商工省除了　獎勵生產木棉以代替羊毛、　節約限制羊毛的使用、　必要時改向紐西蘭·南阿·南美等地購買輸入、農林省亦計劃以廿年乃至三十年爲期、使內地農民養育綿羊六七百萬頭、以補救當前的危機外、滿鐵會社並計劃在哈爾濱創設大規模之畜牧塲、陸軍常局則加緊掠奪蒙古平原、以利用牧畜民族的蒙古人、做他們飼養綿羊的奴隸、棉花大半依靠由美國·印度及埃及的輸入、如去年度輸入額七億一千四百萬之中、三億七千一百萬元、係由美國進口、三億二百萬元、係由印度埃及輸入、二千萬元係由中國輸入、由此可知設若英美兩國間任何一方對日實行禁止棉花輸出、日本卽將感受重大困難、因此他乃在華北積極棉花改良的計劃、提出所謂工業日本農業中國的口號、其原因在此、欲華北農民一律爲其種植棉花、說什麼提倡農業啦、改良技術啦、說自然科學研究所栽培人才啦、這都是欺人的鬼話、再說到鐵的一項、根據去年度的輸入統計、鑛石爲四千四百萬元、銑鐵爲四千一百萬元、鐵板等爲一億六千五百萬元、其中鑛鐵之一千一百萬元·銑鐵之一千八百萬元·由中國及「滿洲」輸入外、其餘大部份均仰給於歐美各國、及英美各國勢力範圍之領域內、這也是日本所不放心的、所以他自從掠奪東北四省以後、便在華北各省進行所謂自治陰謀、其目的也在於山西所蘊藏的著名媒礦以外之大量鐵礦至於石油、去年度的輸入額、亦達一億五千萬元之多、其來源亦以美國及荷領印度爲主要、因爲這是日本最需要而最感缺乏的原料之一、所以除了謀向山西等地進行奪取油鐵礦的陰謀外、又在國內積極提倡石炭液化的研究與製造、上面所說是爲解决原料恐慌、在經濟提携的烟幕下、以向中國不斷侵攻的內在原因、然而日本的野心與陰謀、猶不止此、他不但要掠奪中國的資源、以求滿足慾壑、並且還垂涎南洋各島、因此、除陸軍的北進政策以外、還有海軍的南進政策、也正在積極進行之中、以圖用各種手段、刦掠南洋的資源、如南洋拓植和台灣拓植兩會社、便是爲實現這種陰謀的觸乎、拓務省中設立南洋局的醞釀、也就是這種陰謀的日趨於具體化的表徵、總之、日本是個先天不足資源貧弱的國家、他要稱覇東洋、遂不惜以各種掠奪手段、向外取得經濟方面的滿足、無論對中國對南洋的任何和平方策、揭開面具、都有着一副猙獰可怖的面目、不過、中國爲某最大的目標、而軟進硬幹的方法也特別多、我們不要生存則已、不然的話、難道還不應該起來爲保衛僅有的資源而奮鬭、以求自力更生麼、</p>

<p>— 本報特派記者石瑛</p>
<p>浙江的交通</p>
<p>浙江地處中國沿海省份的中部，仰賴自然環境的厚賜，氣候適宜，土地肥腴，物產豐富，文化優越，向來都以繁華進步見稱。自民國十八年以來，當局銳意建設交通，如浙贛路的展築通車，錢江大橋的積極建設，滬杭甬鐵路工程的節節進展，以及分頭完成各縣公路，俾與七省公路網的脈絡打通，此種突飛孟晋之成績，確非他省建設所能比擬。此外還有正在籌建中的京衢鐵路，路綫山首都南行，經安徽歙縣（徽州），直與浙贛路中點衙縣相接，此路在地理應用上的形勢，很與新近建築成功的蘇（州）嘉（興）路相似，但以國防中樞捷徑運輸言之，京　路乃重要冬矣。</p>
<p>浙省交通，如此發達，在相反的作用上，地方受到的壤影響，目前却也不少。第一，外來的工業品，對於邊遠縣份和鄉村的傾銷，更將如虎添翼，長伸直入，向每一縣每一鄉的血管　聲。中外聞名的所謂「杭綢」「湖縐」「熟羅」的絲織業，一向暢銷省外國外市塲者，近年突被日本人造絲衝破，已漸見一蹶不振之勢。最近華北走私盛行，人造絲更南下偷營刦寨，首先侵入浙西一帶絲綢業的大本營，决卽遠及浙東邊區江山等縣，（江山商界會有驅逐私商出境之事，）這自然是交通贊翊之功</p>
<p>其次今後施展政治軍事，交通便利，本可增進效率。何况浙省與閩贛皖毘接的邊區縣份，不久的以前，會受過赤化的洗禮，假如那裏突生變動，杭州或其他重要都市的兵，不消幾個鐘頭，便可應聲而往，從事淸勦，以免死灰復燃。但是每一條公路或鐵路的新築通車，緊接着就有幾萬船夫挑夫的失業羣。固然一部份也會為交通業所吸收，如車站上的搬運夫，公路上的養路工，然而僅佔極少數。其餘大部份的失業羣，也就是年富力强的苦力，等到東也碰壁西也碰壁之後，自然是要去過流浪掠奪的生活了。浙東多山的縣份，常有拿着土法製造的手溜彈，去幹一請活財神」的綁票勾當，十發九中，這不是偶然的事。</p>
<p>而且交通發展，對於勦辦大股赤匪的軍運，固然很占優勢，但欲藉此肅淸化整為零的散匪，却無怎樣的把握。因為汽車不能追着匪踪去登山越嶺，履險如夷。而堂堂的正式官軍，更不能與匪軍載戰載追，以致引入絕地，因小失大。匪的流竄，甚至食糧都可以不帶，而官軍的行軍，僅公文箱至少也有幾大担。叉如某山某村發生了匪踪，有人報告附近駐軍，該駐軍必先向上峯請示，并派人偵察各情，後才動員，匪軍叉不恭候送禮，甯不早已溜之大吉麽？所以浙東有位保安司令說，「淸勦殘匪之難於圍勦股匯，道很像捉幾個跳蚤，比打一隻老虎還困難。」然而這話還未搔着癢處。記者曾和浙東鄰匪區的幾個老百姓談過話，問他們當匪的，究竟那一類人多些，答語歸納起來是：「當匪的就是苦腦子，苦腦子就是老百姓。老百姓沒有飯吃的太多，匪是不會肅淸的。」這樣樸質無文的老實話，却是追溯匪因，一針見血之至言。</p>
<p>杭州市的熱鬧街頭，熙來攘往的人繁中，細加觀察，也有不少的流浪者，在那裹像煞無目的而又有所期待似的游蕩着，看他們那副栖栖惶惶的尊容，假若有人肯惠然拍肩一呼：「朋友，你是由鄉下跑來找工做的麼？現在某工廠正在招工哩！」那麼他們馬上便會喜了，吊出淚來。杭州流浪的失業者，雖則與上海情形差不多，但是强盜綁票的案犯却極少，這是要歸功於杭州沒有租界的好處。還有滿街的人力車，為數也非常可觀，尤其在碼頭車站或旅館門口，不待你呌「黃包車」，他們常常會一擁而上，把你圍得水洩不通。可是見你指定一車講價，其餘的便漸漸退開了，很少像上海特別是南京廣州的車夫，往往互相拼命的爭生意，結果甲拉而乙不讓，乙拉而甲不許，反由第三人者的丙，笑眯眯地把乘客拖着去了。他們（杭州的車夫）在傍晚生意鬆閒的辰光，便有意無意地放下空車，各自坐在踏板上，大家聚攏談話。若在車站碼頭或湖濱一帶的，那還另有一些船夫挑夫，也會一個個的歡然加入。見有警察走過，或者生人注意，他們又很機警地拿起傢伙，（車或扁担，）隨便講起生意話來。所以我覺得他們之間，好像有一種什麽默契和了解，也許是一種新式團結習慣與潛力，此間熟視的人，大概是不會介意的。</p>
<p>丟開勞力無出路的問題，再概括地談談其他方面的。杭州因為沾了美麗幽靜的西湖的光，并承環湖許多名山寺院的庇蔭，每當春遊香汎的季節，拿着法幣到這裹來調劑市面的，眞不知有幾千幾萬。據說今春天氣失常，花事參差開放，好像西子故意把春多留住了些時候，所以比往年多逗引來些遊客。可是事後去問旅館商店和出賣特產的老闆，今年是吾特別多賺了幾個錢，然而十家有九家，仍是向你搖頭。這其中的曲折奧妙雖多，但總解答只消去請教海關的出超先生。</p>
<p>浙江人民，大多數以農為業，因為地味得天獨厚，農民生活頗稱優裕。可是自民國九年以後，迭經軍閥內戰，稅捐頻繁，農民的安居問題，和經濟基礎，使逐漸動搖起來。尤其前年旱魆為患，客鄉亳無收成，人造絲襲破農村副產絲業的壁　，農村經濟更一敗而不可收拾。全省田地的五千萬畝，以所產而供給二千一百餘萬人口的消費，無怪洋米洋麪須入境補充，長此不謀補救，生路甯不愈走愈仄？</p>
<p>濱海各縣，本是魚鹽之鄉，可惜鹽稅向來很重，近年尤甚，從反面激了販私之風，亦日甚一日，辦鹽務的為欲增加并固定稅額起見，常委託一二鹽商去包辦，鹽商怕無厚利可賺，只好由緝私方面去努力，又因查鹽手續的失當，常常惹起人民極度的公憤，倘野心家乘機煽動，誰敢說不是一大禍胎，鄭板橋昔做某縣令時，會把鹽販押赴鹽店門首，并畫幾幅蘭竹貼在滑稽的刑具上，衆聚圍觀，鹽商無法做生意，再三請求，始將私商笑釋。可見居間剝削的鹽商，自來不大為人所歡迎。假使政府能設法减少食鹽的一分剝削，無形中必能釋一分民怨　，而蘇一分民困。私販無大利可圖，可望絕跡，猶其餘事。</p>
<p>要之，浙江交通建設的發達，得與七省公路網作便捷的聯絡，在所謂安內或國防的立塲上，自必將致大用。憔在發展經濟意義上，當此農村破產，商業疲敝，外貨充斥，足族工業萎縮的現狀中，目前却無什麼大利可述，主幹交通如浙贛路貨運的異常淸淡，卽其一證，然而道是受了客觀上政治經濟條件的限制，而非交通本身問題上的缺陷呵。</p>

<p>王曉籟詞</p>

<h3 id="c188">中國合作運動向那裏去 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 壽勉成</p>
<p>近來我國合作事業，幾如雨後春荀，到處奔放；但是在這風行一時的運動裏面，我們可以看到幾個不同的方向：有的主張由上而下的推行，有的主張由下而上的滋長，此其一；有的主張强制組織，有的主張自動採納，此其二；有的主張以生產合作為本位，有的主張以消費合作為本位，此其三；有的主張合作事業的計劃統制，有的主張合作事業的自由發展，此其四。在這各種不同的方向裏面，我們究竟應該向那裏去，就成為一個很大的問題。假使我們不能及時確定途徑，以致誤入歧路，則中國合作運動的成功，就是中國合作的失敗，這是不可以不慎重的。</p>
<p>我以為一切經濟政策的决定，都離不了三個原則：第一就是要能夠合乎此時此地之社會的需要，不合此需要的建設，是不經濟的建設；第二就是要能夠合乎此時此地之社會的能力，能力所不可及的計劃，是沒有效力的計劃；第三就是要能夠認識一種政策之各方面的關係，假使顧此失　，則於不經濟與無效力之間，二者必居其一。</p>
<p>中國合作運動，既已成為中國經濟政策必不可少之部份，則其不能違反上述三原則，自亦不能例外。所以陳立夫先生最近在合作學院演講，謂中國為農業國家，彼資本主義國家所產生之合作組織，必經相當修改，然後能適合我國需要，的確是很不錯的。不過，我們要注意，需要與供給的適應是相對的；適合中國需要的組織，不一定是好的組織；同時，不適合中國現實需要的組織，也不一定是壞的組織。第一因為需要的本身，還有好壞的不同，假使需要的本身就有缺點，則適應之反為不美。第二因為需要的感覺，大有程度的不同。有的需要，在旁觀的人以為確是存在，而在當事的人，也許因為智識及習慣的關係，並沒有這種感覺。所以所謂需要，應指客觀的合理的需要而言。至於能力的解釋，亦復如是，蓋亦須以動的觀察决定之，因為吾人能力的大小，亦每視運用之是否得法而異。</p>
<p>明乎上述三原則，請再進而分析我國合作運動應取的動向。</p>
<p>所謂由下而上及由上而下的劃分，就是現在有一部分同志所說，合作運動與合作政策的區別。不過，我以為將運動與政策認為對立的名稱，尚覺不甚正確，因為我們可以有推行合作運動的政策，也可以有推行合作政策的運動。而且合作運動，也不一定由下而上，我們試一看各國合作事業發展的經過，雖或不由政府負責推動，但每有其他由上而下之力量，從事推進，如各國農會及農業協會對於合作之提倡維護是。所以這裏面的區別，實在還不是上下的先後，而在知道的主體。那末；我們的問題，也可以說就是：中國的合作運動，還是應該歸政府指導呢？還是應該歸私人的團體指導？我在別的地方已經說過，在這兩條路裏面，我是主張歸政府指導的。這裏面的理由，不必再去細講。不過從前許多國家的合作事業，何以多歸私人團體指導？這我以為有幾個理由：第一，從前的政府，對於合作事業的意義及其重要，還沒有充分的認識；第二，有的政府，因為受資本家的控制，所以不敢公然出來提倡合作；第三，私人團體確有充分力量可以替代政府負擔這種使命；第四，一般人民智識較高，組織能力較强，故即由私人團體指導，亦易於生效；第五，資本主義已經相當發展，所以一部分人民雖感覺合作事業的需要，而在政府則不免漠視；第六，外國政黨的政策，比較顯明。政黨不同，則其政綱亦不相同，故合作專業為避免政治影響，不如歸私人團體指導。但是反轉來看看中國的情形怎樣？照我們的需要，照我們的能力，照各方面的關係觀察，我們的合作專業，實非歸政府指導不可。不過，政府指導與私人指導，並不是互相排斥的。假使有可以輔助政府的私人指導機關，政府正不妨獎勵其盡輔導的責任，以補政府之所不及。而且政府固然負担了整個的指導責任，同時仍須培養人民的自動力量，使其逐漸能夠自立。</p>
<p>既已决定由政府負責指導，我們又發見兩條不同的途徑，就是酒精還是採取强制組織呢？還是由人民自動的去組織？我以為我們至少可以承認，强制組織是一個可以酌量採用的方法：第一因為合作事業既為發展國民經濟的主要方法，而國民經濟建設又必須以最高速度求其發展，則非加以强制，自將無以達到目的；第二因為合作雖應出于自動，但是假使合作的結果，必能於各分子有實在的利益，則强制亦復何妨，第三因為合作是方法，並不是目的，合作的目的，應該是生存的維持與改善，那末，衹要能以同樣方法達到同樣目的，就行，至於方法的方法，究竟是否出於强制，可以不問；第四因為社會的惰性甚强，許多新興事業，人民因限於習慣，每不肯自動進行，故為克服社會惰性起見，亦有强制的必要。但是我們研究的對象，如係專指某一地方某種合作事業在某人指導之下是否可以强制組織，那就很容易决定其是否宜於强制。現在要想把這個原則，應用到任何地方任何事業及任何人指導之下，那就會發生很大的流弊與危險。所以我們對於這個問題，不但不能有，而且不應該有絕對的决定，必須視個別情形而異其處置，方能合理。</p>
<p>其次，再讓我把合作事業的本位問題來分析一下。這就是說，中國的合作運動，究竟還是應該拿生產合作做本位呢？還是應該拿消費合作做本位？有的人也許以為這是根本不能成立的一個問題，因為事實上中國所有已往的消費合作社，差不多都是失敗的，衹有農村裏面的生產合作社（包括運銷合作社）倒還有相當的發展，假使現在還要主張以消費合作為本位，不是倒行逆施嗎？但是從合作制度的本質來說，生產合作既以分配　餘為目的，他就不能說是真正的合作。雖然生產合作社的贏餘，並不依股份的多少而分配，似乎與純粹資本主義的公司組織不盡相同，但是各社員所繳的生產品實與股本同樣性質，所以依生產品分配贏餘，與依股本分配贏餘，名異而實相同，那末，假使生產合作，可以說是合作，工商業者所組織的聯合購買或運銷機關，應該也可以說是合作社了。這當然是不對的。所以真正的合作運動一定要從消費合作出發。惟有以消費合作為本位的合作制度，然後可以達到取消贏餘的目的，可以替代資本主義而實現三民注意的經濟制度。我在從前已經講過，有的時候因為環境的要求，合作事業的本質是可以有相當變化的，但是合作制度的本質，必有其最低限度的挑件，換言之，就是合作制度的變化不能不有其最大限度的範圍。如果衹講方法而忘其目的，僅留軀殼而去其靈魂，那還成什麽合作運動呢？所以我以為生產合作衹能在兩個條件以下，求其發展：第一就是組織生產合作社的分子，其生產收入必在社會一般之平均收入以下，則雖享受贏餘，仍僅足以補財富分配之不均；第二就是消費合作社必須同時求其發展，務使生產合作社，事實上能逐漸成為消費合作社之生產機關。那　能算是雙方兼顧的辦法。</p>
<p>但是消費合作社在過去既然這樣沒有成　，又怎麼辦呢？這個問題固然很值得我們考慮，但是我們也不要認為太沒有辦法了；第一因為中國政府對於消費合作從來沒有同對於生產合作一樣的加以積極的指導與提倡；第二因為過去經營消費合作社的人選，大都不甚適當，或雖有能力而不認真，或雖欲認真辦理而無營業經騐；第三因為我國一般生活之不科學化與合理化，雖然是推行消費合作的一大障碍，但是我們就是不為推行消費合作，這種生活方式也是應該要改善的；第四因為消費合作的成效，有時候好像同商業社會化的進步成反比例，換一句話就是說商業方法愈不能適合消費者的要求，則消費合作愈易發達，那末，中國的商店既然那樣幼稚，消費合作應該是可以發達的。</p>
<p>最後，還有一個問題，就是政府對於合作事業的發展，是否應該採取計劃統制的辦法，以完成整個的合作綱，使其不致長在無政府狀態之中而且可以提高合作組織的效率呢？計劃統制對於經濟建設的重要，我在別的地方已經講過。根據同樣立塲我當然希望合作事業，也能夠有它的計劃與統制。所以行政權的統一，總登記的實行，運銷的集中等等，都是最低限度之應有的設施。不過計劃統制的實施，稍有疏忽，即可鑄成大錯，因此非絕對　慎不可。最要緊的就是要時時刻刻記住計劃統制是方法不是目的。計劃統制的目的，在促進合作綱的健全，提高合作綱的效率，與增進合作者的幸福。所以假使但求計劃之實現與統制之執行，甚至已見流弊而仍不知所以善其後，那就是所謂弄巧成拙，不足為法了。至於善意對合作加以種種障　，美其名曰統制，而實即所以害之，那是反合作的活動，當然不在我們所講的統制意義之內。</p>
<p>根據以上各點，我們對於中國合作運動應該走的途徑或方向，已經可以得到相當的瞭解。概括的說，就是：一，全國的合作事業，應由政府負責積極指導，而以私人團體居於輔導地位；二，强制組織在原則上可以採用，但不宜普遍推行；三，合作運動應以消費合作為本位，生產合作僅能在某種條件下認為合理；四，合作事業應有其整個的計劃與統制，但應％慎辦理，務以不妨害其目的為標準。</p>
<h3 id="c189">消費合作如何推廣問題 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 陳惠武</p>
<p>關於消費合作可以解決國民生計的理論，不在我們討論範圍之內，但，我們之所以要推廣消費合作，却是根據這個信念而來。雖然，這衹是我們曾對合作稍曾認識的人的信念，許多的貧民，忍受着痛苦，忍受着商人們的剝削，過着淒慘黑暗的生活，却不知用以自救。他們缺乏教育，缺乏能力，缺乏組織，又因為曾受過許多的欺騙，存着懷疑，缺乏信仰。當我們告訴他們說：「組織合作社可以解救你們！」他們一方面不甚理解合作是什麽；即使有較聰明的，也衹接受了合作制度中較動人聽聞的東西，譬如說發還盈餘，價格公道等等，一方面他們懷疑我們，性情惡劣些的會馬上罵我們是騙子，是說謊；性情好些的也會婉言拒絕，即或有若干好奇的，感覺興趣而來嘗試，也常常歸於失敗。</p>
<p>還有職業較佳的薪水階級，由於普通商業交易的習慣，並無若何興趣來實行合作。若干被勸說或被強迫而加入的社員，也只是徒具虛名，不願「惠然光顧」、即有若干本具濃厚興趣的社員也因了社中售價與普通商店相仿，雖有盈餘可分，而為數不免又須在數月之後，因之也感乏味，而重為一般甜言蜜語的商人所吸引以去。</p>
<p>這樣消費合作在我國就呈着不生不死的現象，而它之所以能不死，還是因了許多熱心提倡者的維持。</p>
<p>但消費合作究竞是解决生計最好的辦法，一般人的不肯採用，寗可受着痛苦，不知自救，在我們旁觀的人看來，如果是稍存一些熱心的，真是有些不可耐了，因之我們毅然主張在這方面稍稍的用一些强迫。</p>
<p>强迫驟然看來，彷彿和合作精神大相違背，可是在特殊情形之下，我們可以視為例外的。最好的　　，我們可以借醫病來說明，有些病人須受力刲的治療，而常因了一些輕信和恐懼拒絕了醫生的施術，但如果所遇到的是一位忠實的醫生時，一定會被他毅然地加以强制，因為一個忠實的醫生爲了病人的幸福起見，一時的怨恨，是所不惜的。</p>
<p>我們用一些小小的强迫來推進合作也正和這意思一樣。</p>
<p>强迫之所以有人反對者，因為它不管一切，突然地按照了少數人的私意，改變了人們的生活方式，不管這些人們對於他們的新環境是否愛好，能否適應；社會主義者所唱的革命，用暴動和沒收的方法來改革政治和經濟，就是如此。可是我們主張的强迫的性質和程度就與之不同。我們所主張的强迫，衹是暫時性的，程度上也衹是很輕微地不會破壞他們以往生活的秩序，即或有所破壞，也衹是那些惡習慣，破壞了然後可以使他們向我們公認的善的路上走去。</p>
<p>這種主張的立塲，也許有人要問，那，我們很高興地回答是安穩地立在連鎖主意之上的</p>
<p>連鎖的演進和文化的發展有密切的關係，一種文化的發展，不是因少數人的推動所可致，必須得到大多數人的接受方算告成。連鎖不是文化，它是文化階段的關係。它倆正比例地演進着，文化進步，連鎖的關係也進步，反之，文化退縮，連鎖關係也就畏縮不前，所以文化日漸進步，連鎖關係也從强制性質的，進步為半强制的，而現在據說已至。逐漸進入全然自由的時代了。</p>
<p>但這三分的連鎖過程，衹是為我們解說便利而設的。從强迫到自由的進化過程中，並沒有任何具體的階級。我們從强制出發向着自由走去，多行一里，離自由也就愈近一里，這是一個連續的過程，並不是像一個三級的梯　。所以我們可以說，我們所經過的那是半强制半自由的過程，　可以說經過了許多程度不齊的强制和自由混合的階段。自由的連鎖雖是行程的終點，理想的止境，但如果文化程度，尚躊躇於需要一些强制的過程中時，勉強着來試行自由的連鎖，實是一個錯誤。這錯誤並會帶給我們一個不可倖免的失敗。因為連鎖關係是一個結果，而不是能推動文化的因子。我們鼓吹自由，主張自由，實無濟於事，除非從它的原因，促進文化，着手，我們决不能奢望獲得希冀着的結果的，但文化的促進，雖可因我們的努力結成，却也不是一蹴所能即就。</p>
<p>我們的推行合作就是促進文化，由此我們可以得到所希冀的自由。我們利用合作為敎育的工具，糾正我們自私觀念的錯誤，訓練我們的組織自治能力，這樣，我們知道自動地去擇善，而自由也不求自來。但，我們决不能因自由而得到合作，非但不能，一些誤解的自由反為合作之敵。借了自由的名義，許多人演出了不法行為，因為自由和其它名誤一樣，詞解的容易實甚於了解。</p>
<p>現在我們試來看看，我們自己的文化，究竟怎樣？在我們之間，都是中國人，實無需任何的誇張—誇張本身也許會給我們一些快感，可是於實際决無好處。</p>
<p>我們不必追述我們的三皇五帝，孔孟郅治心靜氣，照一下鏡子，看看我們的現狀就够了</p>
<p>文盲的遍地，自治精神的缺乏，團結力的薄弱——在一個很小的團體之中，也必起分化，正如總理所說的一盤散沙，性格的懦弱，自私心的强盛，政治的不上軌道，產業的東後，經濟的瀕於破產，外侮的日甚，一切的一切，無非是醜態百出，在這樣的文化條件之下，我們是不能奢望自由的。我們在我們過分的自由之中，不得不加一些强制，雖然，我們所主張的强制確實祗有那小小的一點。</p>
<p>强制並不是恥辱，並不是不道德，各國都有它的存在。季特敎授在他的恊作中，也曾讚美過。就是我們的合作大師薛仙舟先生的「中國的合作的方案」也主張用國家的力量來實行統制。</p>
<p>所以，我們的結論是，現在我國民生的凋敝，唯有合作能救濟，而推行合作，則必須政府加以一些强制。</p>
<p>至於推廣的辦法，雖然應顧到許多方面，但，這裏，我們只就城市的薪給工人階級和農民兩方面來說：</p>
<p>薪給工人階級</p>
<p>公務人員，機關職員，工廠工人，都是這階級的主要份子，他們薪資的發給必經機關之手，這樣我們可以代替他們取出一部份極小的數目，預備積聚為合作社股金。譬如我們以兩元為股額，那麼每月五毛錢，四個月的繳納，就使他們成為一個合作社的社員了。這種扣折薪資的辦法，當我國災荒嚴重時，常常地施行，祗是那時是救人賑災，而這時是救己加入合作社。我們强迫他們救人，當然也應强迫他們救己。强迫救己又是流行的事實，譬如勞働保險制，强迫儲蓄等，都是最好的例子。而合作較之這些方式更來得切實，因為這些儲蓄保險制，非特一些不幸事件發生了，他們不會感覺任何好處，而加入了合作社，他們却可卽時得到經濟上以及其它的利益。這樣的强制的自助，為什麼不能實行呢？——如這種辦法實行時，各機關工廠，可以預墊一筆資金，卽時使之開辦。</p>
<p>但在這種情形之下，一些社員，因為他們的加入是受强迫的，除非合作社本身對他們有許多顯著的利益，——一個健全的合作商店當然應該辦到這點，——他們常常不願光顧交易，為了彌補這缺陷，我們又有如下的一個方法。</p>
<p>這方法就是由各機關或工廠當局墊欵開辦一個合作商店，然後印行一種向這商店通用的特種的代價券，在他們的薪給中發付，替代一部的現金。代價券所占的成數，當然應該愼重考慮，在試辦時，尤須少發。這樣，職員或工人們拿了這和外界不能交易的代價券，就祗得向合作商店交易了，而合作商品交易額，旣有了最少的限度，維持自無困難；祗要辦得健全，不使社員有不如其它普通商店之感，社員决不會覺得發行代價券有什麼不便。反之，他們的興趣，反會日漸濃厚。</p>
<p>這樣的辦法不是憑空的理想，上海那家聞名的康元製罐廠，就有這樣一家小小的商店，工人們都感到許多的方便。</p>
<p>這辦法還有一個好處，就是能使社員有一筆正常用途的消費，不致有全部浪費於縱慾賭博等事發生。</p>
<p>農村</p>
<p>農村中不適宜於推行分配合作，因為鄕村分散沒有一個適中的地點，而且今日我國農民，消費的範圍實在很狹，他們所消費的可說只是糧食，眞是說來有些可憐。</p>
<p>但他們為了生產的消費却不能减少，所以我們可以推廣他們的供給合作社。</p>
<p>推廣供給合作社最好與信用合作社合作。如果在可以兼營的信用合作社中，我們可以用供給貨品的辦法來替代現金借貸，這樣信用合作與供給合作的目的都能達到，而信用合作從事於生產放欵的原則也可因以維持。</p>
<p>如果信用合作不得兼營的話，那也可以在貸欵以後，强迫社員組織供給合作社。因為信用合作的目的，在促進生產，而供給合作社則是達到合理的生產的必經過程。有些人以為信用合作社社員負了無限責任不應再組其它合作社以免影響他們所負的責任。其實這是一個錯誤，因為單獨購買與共同合作購買同為經濟行為，如果說有危險性的話，那麼除非停止賣買外，决不能免，而實際前者因受不合理條件的交易，危險尤大，怎樣可以允許社員單獨的交易，而不准合作的合理交易，豈不是不近情理之談！所以供給合作實在是最切要的一個推廣方面。</p>
<p>但無論推廣那種消費合作都好，合作社本身的健全和合理實是成功最大的關鍵。在這裏我們只能討論一個原則，至於一個合理的健全的消費合作社應怎樣辦理，除了依照許多先進者的經騐與敎訓外，還望我們大家隨時研究和試騐，我們少數人的幻想是决不可靠的。</p>
<h3 id="c190">合作社組織之効率問題 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 程君淸</p>
<p>合作社之組織，乃為適應某種需要而發生。於是其主要業務，有信用，供給，生產，運銷等種種之類別。然宇宙間事，往往當事者不感覺其有某種之需要，實則其需要性非常殷切；或則感覺需要之切，而無法使適應需要之手段，迅速而美滿。是二者，於國內邇來不合作事業，頗似有此現象。於是乎合作社之組織，發生其效率之問題焉。所謂合作社組織之效率問題，卽若何喚起大多數人民感覺其眞正之需要；與若何使合作社組織，在迅速而美滿之過程中，滿足其迫切之需要也。</p>
<p>國人對於前項問題，曾提出種種辦法；姑不具論。不佞以為解决之名義。一，為在不違反中央有關合作業之法令下想辦法；否則不得援用合作社之名義。茲略述其綱要如下：</p>
<p>關於第一個問題，可提出如下各項辦法：　已組織之合作社，應切實查明其成効，詳細尋得其利益所在，以之比較未組織合作社同一樣區域內同樣人民之單獨處理其經濟事務，尋求其得失所在；而後廣為傳佈之。此項辦法，必先切實整頓原有合作社，使其經營有利方可。</p>
<p>隨時多舉行或按時舉行集會講演。以誠懇和平之態度，坦直切實之內容，粗淺有趣之語調，引起人民注意。</p>
<p>從事藝術化之傳導。如戲劇，歌曲，電影等，使深入民間。（如陳果夫先生所編合作之初及中國華洋義賑會之擴大社務週辦法）</p>
<p>合作指導員應學習一二種本領，為人民所普遍需求者。如通常之醫療及衛生方法，音樂，算術，書畫，美術。掌故。小說等等，以為聯絡之媒介，而後因勢利導之。</p>
<p>關於第二個問題，可提出如下各項辦法：</p>
<p>在一般人智識低微之現狀下，合作組織之需要，賴合作指導員認淸事實而測定其種類。不忍先就智識較高品行善良之人民中，徵集合法人數，迅予組織成立。每一鄕鎭至少一社。</p>
<p>合作社成立後，為維持其業務之繁榮起見，除信用放欵外，盡量與非社員交易。不妨採用商業化之推廣方法。惟凡與非社員交易之辦法，與社員同；卽必須每人有一分戶紀錄之盈餘，祇能作為移充社股之用。在未得本人同意加入時，暫記存欵賬，不得兌現。祇有利息可付，</p>
<p>同一地方合作社數，同一業務者滿五社以上時，迅予成立區聯合社。區聯社五社以上時，迅組縣聯社。一省之縣聯合社，滿十社以上時，迅予組織省聯合社。縣或省之聯合社，農民銀行有儘量供給資金之義務。其經理等主要職員，由省主管合作行政機關甄別合格後方得任用。省聯合社之開支經費，應在最初之五年內就該省內放欵銀行所收合作社借欵利息中，撥出一部份，按其核准之預算數（預算由省主管行政機關核定）中分擔補助之。</p>
<p>省縣聯合社得取兼營制，或單營制。就事實之需要而定。省內合作社一切業務進行，由聯合社層層統制之。</p>
<p>各省聯合社同一業務滿五個以上時，迅予組織全國性質之合作社聯合社。其中主要辦事人員，經實業部合作司甄別合格後，由聯社之理事會任用之。開支經費預算，經合作司核准後，在最初五年內，應由全國各主要銀行之經營合作貸欵者，就其合作部份所獲利息中各撥一部份分擔補助之。</p>
<p>以上二項辦法，純屬個人之意見。就正於合作先進。深願起予批評；以求合作社組織之効率問題，在原則上，得一相當之解决後，　諸中央合作主管機關，加以審核，而規定其實施辦法。則幸甚矣。</p>

<p>夢蘭一口氣把這封信看過之後，早是全身出了一身冷汗，趕快把信紙折叠着，依然塞到信封裏去。將信封揣到裏衣的口袋裏，還用手按了一按，這才牽扯牽扯自己的衣襟擺，向四周看了一看。雖然四處無人，可是自己的臉皮，只加倍感到緊張，便是耳朶背後，也都覺得有些發燒似的。站在芭蕉陰下右手扯了芭蕉葉子尖端，左手却將芭蕉葉的邊緣，撕開一條縫，慢慢的向中間撕了去。他也不知道這是一種什麽情景，只是這樣一條條的撕下去。過了一會子，忽然有人呌道：密撕江，爲什麽不上課？早打過鐘了。夢蘭哦着笑了一聲，就跑上講堂去。可是他心裏紊亂極了，在課堂上，先生所講的是些什麽，完全都不知道。下午有四堂課，却只上了三堂，便回家了。所以急於要回家的原故，是想把這封信，仔仔細細的重看一遍。可是到家之後，母親嫂嫂，全都　着，今天何以回來得這樣的早。這樣的話，也是極平常的，可是夢蘭一聽到了，就彷彿這是有心問出來的話似的，勉強答應了是先生請假，那聲音還是非常之細小。雖是家裏人並不根據這句話盤問了下去，但是也不便立刻就走回自己樓上去，在嫂嫂屋子裏坐一會，在母親屋子裏又坐一會，直等着吃過了晚飯，這才從容不迫的回到樓房裏去。自己先把房門關上了，將背對了房門坐下，才把那封信掏了出來，先將信封凝神注視了一會然後把信紙抽出，捏在手心裏，却把信封折疊着，先揣到衣袋裏，然後兩手捧着信紙，就了燈火，一行行的看去。把三張宜紙的恭楷信箋，全都看完了。把信紙折疊着，依然塞到信封裏面，而且依舊把信封揣到懷裏去。自己兩手抱了膝蓋，對了燈，呆呆的望着。心裏這就想到，這位章先生，可有點胡鬧了。他在朋友家裏，去打聽我的姓名。這豈不是故意讓人知道？彼此雖是在巷子裏常常遇到，那不過是一位神交的朋友，信上所說的那些話，全差得很遠。他很大胆的，把這種信寄到學堂裏去。幸而是我自己接着了，這信若是落到別人手上去了，那不是一樁很大的笑話嗎？他心裏想着，先是兩手撑了頭，然後兩手　交着，按在桌沿上，頂了自己的下巴　。最後拿起筆來，展開了一張紙，在上面有氣無力的寫着字。（四三）</p>
<h3 id="c201">新婚旅行和結婚指環的來源 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>現今流行於都市城鎮裏的新式結婚儀式中，新郎新娘交換指環，早已是習見不鮮的事情，而且成為婚式中所必有的節目了。同樣，新婚旅行也幾乎成為有錢而又時髦的人們當甜蜜地結婚之後的必要的舉動，毫不使我們覺得刺眼。人們總是沿着習慣而生活的，但極少有人想去考據一下這習慣之所以會得形成的起源。即如新婚旅行與結婚指環，大多人僅只知道它們是舶來的事物，而對於它們的產生，却全都茫然不知。</p>
<p>我們知道，掠奪婚在古代是到處都有，差不多一切民族都有。在婦女缺少的地方，結婚困難，掠奪結婚便是最簡便的補救方法。而實行一夫多妻制的地方，也因為婦女的不夠分配，同樣也流行婦女掠奪的事。</p>
<p>這種婚姻的　　，直至今日我們還可以在南部智利的阿洛剛人的婚儀中看到。當女婿的朋友和新娘的父親商量的時候，新郎偷偷地奪了新娘，騎着事前預備的馬匹，向森林中奔逃，他不顧男女老小大聲呼喚的阻止，將新娘帶到樹林的深處，於是婚姻便算成立了。新婚旅行，也就表示新郎將新娘從伊的家裏奪走，逃　開去以達到他掠奪的目的而已。</p>
<p>交換指環是從單由新娘接受新郎的指環　　來的。這風俗起源於羅馬，指環是鐵製的，用來表示妻子被丈夫　縛的意思。後來為求美觀，指環變成金製的，就把起初的用意消减了一半。再後來交換指環，表示互相結合，便把剩下的一半意義也完全消減完了。</p>

<p>淋病之療法甚多，有注射，有電療，有器械療法，以及內服製劑等等。顧數種療法中，除藥治之外，皆須手術諳練之醫師行之，方不致引起他虞。而藥物一項，求共效騐確切者，又屬罕覯。近來雖有透膜殺菌療法，亦不過作用于局部。不能奉根治之實效也。</p>
<p>邇日在各國醫界中，盛行一種白血球增加療法，其神效至足驚人，老其學理，則因增加白血球，而喰菌之力猛增，于是不論潛伏體內何部或留居血中之淋毒，莫不根本肅淸，淋菌遂告根除矣，此為近頃非特異性療法成功之最大原因。實開淋病治療之另一新境地也。</p>
<p>畢德氏後又根據此理，採用動植物之類脂質，及偶以責色素，用特殊科學方法，精提而成「克淋儂」一藥，服後能旺盛白血球，以增進滅菌抗毒之力，而奏永遠免疫之功，故無論有無淋病，若服以此藥，可預防淋病之發生，或已經感染，服此亦得全治，凡急慢性之淋濁，男子前尿道淋，後尿道攝護腺炎，膀胱炎，睪丸炎，女子陰門淋，膿淋，子宮淋，以及關節炎等，一經服此，立奏殊效，而得逐步除根，徹底根斷。但購服時切勿誤聽他人言，而忘購廉價雜牌劣品，致服後引起生命之危險，故宜認淸眞正「克淋儂」三字。因「克淋儂」藥性王道，毫不敗胃及有任何不良刺激，早已風行各國也。</p>

<p>夏令之腸胃病，治法須迅除胃內之炎症，及腸中之酸酵物，而促增其消化機能，以亢進營養之吸收，則可恢復健康，「强胃精」一藥，確具此等功能，故年來醫界，一致認為夏令要藥，而此藥因係酵　複方劑，對于慢性胃病，飲食見畏，食欲減少，嘈雜胸悶，噯氣頻頻，嘔吐嗯心腹部膨脹，陣痛隱隱，及腸嗚下痢，大便溏薄，小兒吐乳綠便等，均有特效，又能增速腸之蠕動，善治大便秘結，並內食大量之蛋黃素，以治老年及烟客便秘與戒　允佳。兼有補血補腦之A，B，D，三種生活素，能於治療因缺乏生活素B之脚氣症外，更有健胃强身之偉力，至其藥性王道，性質和平，允其餘事。</p>

<p>可怖之肺結核</p>
<p>自德國古霍氏發見結核菌後，人類始知結核菌之可怖，其形狀細長，染色後用顯徵鏡檢查之下，全身披有赤毛布狀之毛茸，有如斬斷之一束毛髮然。其體積至小，每一痰塊中，的含有三億萬個，不想以此等么小之細菌，而傷害吾人七尺身軀之生命。其可怖之程度，實在猛虎之上。</p>
<p>考此等肺病之由來，大多數為從呼吸器之傳染，凡傷風感冒，輕徵咳嗽，均為結核病之發端，但常人多忽視之，而不知防患於未然，及至病成，而謀補救，巳覺困難矣。至結核病之症狀，有如下述，如熱型之變態，脈搏之失常，食慾之减退，性慾之亢進，體重之變化，女子月經之困難，（如停經或經閉等），凡發覺有上述種種現象，卽須注意是吾肺病，而謀治療，余在臨床上三十餘年之經騐，凡遇肺結核病患者，除令絕對安靜，注意衛生，多攝有滋養食品外，率令其進服『補肺拿爾』其因體弱者，兼進『補體康』，以增體健，而抗結核菌，女子月經困難，可服『補女容』，無不迅獲奇效，因此等藥劑不但有殺菌之效，並有强身，而增加抗禦結核菌之效能也。</p>

<p>診所：四川路寗波路轉角　診時：上午十時至下午六時</p>
<p>睪丸炎與生殖問題</p>
<p>睪丸，是製造精子之製造所，此等器官如一旦發生病態，輕者妨害其製造工作，重者卽全部毀壞，不能複行製造精子之工作，而生殖能力自此絕矣。故因淋病睪丸炎而致絕嗣者，其百分率甚高。息者在淋病之經過期中，因飲酒勞動，或房事與醫生失當之療法，及其他不攝生而來，其淋菌經由輸精管而侵入副睪丸，在相當時間，卽覺睪丸作痛腫大，在急性期之睪丸炎，恒發四十度乃至四十一度之高熱，但慢性多在不知不覺之中成之。不過淋毒性睪丸炎，多發於右睪，稱為副睪丸炎，如不醫治，則延及左側，而成兩側睪丸炎，副睪丸炎尚有生殖希望，因其尚有保全之一側睪，可以製造精子也。但如兩側睪丸皆已發炎，及化膿脹硬，則生育希望，卽告斷絕矣。</p>
<p>故如患者發見副畢丸炎時，亟宜醫治，切勿遲延，致貽後悔。余遇此症，恒囑其內服克淋藥，俾消內部炎腫，更用電氣及X線療法，以追剿剩餘之淋菌，而恢復生殖力，恒於極短期間，將其治愈。愈後永不復發，且能照常生殖。萬無一失。但如妻子已染淋毒性白帶，致下部糜爛，小腹膨脹，月經不調妨害排尿，亦可外用陰道片為坐藥，內服克淋藥，自可短期治愈，以免互相傳染。</p>
<h3 id="c213">白帶病之變症 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>白帶，本為婦女習見之病，婦女亦以此病為常見而忽視之。豈知許多病症，多從白帶病而起。如月經困難，小腹膨脹，陰門及腔道，皆呈糜爛及紅腫之症象，因此每於小便時，輙覺刺痛異常，以致不能盡量排泄，將餘尿積儲膀胱，而成膀胱炎。更由此而成尿中毒之危險，又因白帶最易招惹細菌，往往發生不測之症狀。</p>
<p>關於白帶之療法，以用「卡而魯氏陰道片」最為有效。因此片有抗禦細菌，制止分泌，平復糜爛，消炎鎮痛之效。每次以一片放入腔道，次晨洗去，卽覺白帶减少，依法應用，效如桴鼓。其因體虛而來者，可兼服『補女容』，以强壯身體，共因淋病傳染者可內服『克淋儂』，以拔去內部淋毒。內外兼治，獲效更速。</p>
<h3 id="c214">對於治肺癆之必要條件 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>肺癆之傳播，雖極廣泛，然感染者，未必卽時發病，吾人在兒時，為癆菌侵襲者，幾於人所不免，而發病則不必每個人皆然，此為普徧易知之事實，蓋肺病之發生，必俟人體抵抗力衰减之時，故在外表上，如見身體衰瘦，食慾减退等，或時見一二聲輕咳，則為肺癆之徵象。此時惟一條件，卽為安靜休息，節省腦力與勞動，而服以防癆之製劑。若肺癆旣已形成，以至第二第三各期，則安靜療法，食餌療法，藥物療法等，皆為治愈之必要條件。所謂食餌療法，卽多食補品，以增進營養，安靜療法，卽多事睡眠，避免神經之過度興奮，而藥物療法，舊來製劑，每不能盡合醫師之意，蓋其功效，至多只能止咳化痰，雖有治病之功，而無防癆之力，故不甚適用。</p>
<p>自近世科學昌盛以來，對於肺病治療，知有增進抵抗力之一法，其奏效與防病之偉績，每超過吾人意想之限度，查此項製劑，則有「補肺拿爾」一藥，其治癆也，則于喀血咯痰，咳嗽氣急，胸部刺痛，食减困倦，潮熱盜汗等，均有顯著之治效，以此藥尤善驅痰鎮咳，故對於久咳頑痰，老年哮喘，小兒百日咳，傷風等，卓著殊功，而其補身防癆之力量，允為他藥所望塵莫及，至肺癆兼罹腦弱失眠，心悸健忘，男子有遺精腰痠，女子有月經諸病，可分別以男用「補體康」女用『補女容』，與此藥同時進服，則遺精自除，經病消失，而衰弱各症，與癆症都捐。</p>

<p>如何始可挽治？</p>
<p>人之所以繼續生存，勞作不息，惟內分泌機能旺盛，繼續其分泌工作，以灌溉全身而已。此種內分泌，從各臟器腺囊泌出，入於血液，分布全身，其功用恰如汽車之與燃料。有之則身體壯健活潑，無之則行動滯重，頭腦不敏，思考遲鈍，面容憔悴，髮白額皺，呈未老先衰之象；此患性神經衰老者，允為著明。所以近頃內分泌學說，甚為風行。冀挽救此項早衰現象，而綿延人類生存於不息。實乃人類極大幸福之發明也。</p>
<p>惟一般學者研究結果，尚多缺陷，迄未能如預期之效力。，獨梅倫氏所發明之男用「補體康」女用「補女容」，一藥，功效卓絕，堪稱內分泌療法中之獨步，考其原料，係擷取勇壯動物之睪丸與卵巢，分別提出荷爾蒙而製成之。會歷多决之動物試騐，結果無不圓滿，復經千萬人之服用，確有如預期之效力，世界科學家，皆譽此二　為「超特之發明」云。凡男性由手淫或房事過度而來之遺精，漏精，下部不舉，發育不全，及女子月經失調，乳房及臀部平坦如男性，及久婚不孕等，服後皆有至效。良由體之內部內分泌機能旺盛，有如汽車之獲汽油，四肢百骸，婦活異常，現此二藥久為世界各大需院臨床所採用，我國醫家用此二藥治愈男女兩性之性神經衰老者，亦日有見聞云。</p>

<h3 id="c218">小學生入山訪道求仙 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>近日報載，本地有兩個十四歲的孩子，相繼入山訪道求仙。這兩個孩子，是某小學的四年級生。平日喜看劍俠小說，志同道合，非常要好。他們時常向同學吐露，欲赴崑崙峨嵋諸名山，尋師學術，以期報效國家。不料兩人竟於上星期日，相約出走，實行仿學奇俠的故事。</p>
<p>記得先前，上海也曾發生過同類的事情？這種愚笨的舉動，顯然是受小說之害的。他們平日喜閱劍俠小說，在書上看過不少奇俠的故事，故一時着迷，自己也效法起來，入山尋師學術，希望成就一個故事中的人物。他們思想幼稚，辨不出小說中的情節是荒誕無稽的，自不免要受共欺騙，作出異想天開的行為。</p>
<p>對於這一個事實，値得注意的，是我國社會教育的不良。劍俠的故事，在舞台上，終年演得很熱鬧。電影界有一個時期，也風行過這一種片子。影響所及，一班孩子玩的，盡是飛劍取人頭的把戲。還有各衖堂口，及各馬路旁的小書攤，劍俠一類的小書，也觸目皆是。這種小書攤，主顧大半是孩子。結果因而受害的，不知有多少？入山訪道求仙的事情，不過是一例而已。</p>
<p>這里一般從事教育和文化的人，實不能熟視無睹。市上不良讀物的存在，是很危險的，應設法使之消滅。像劍俠小說，不但無益，而且有損。但這種書本，坊間到處充斥，流行極廣。無怪孩子一被引誘，便要著述。至若學校及家庭，也須深切注意。平時對於孩子的讀書，應充分加以指導，不可任他們濫看不良的書籍。最好能置備幾種兒童讀物，使孩子閱讀，這在求知方面，是很有益的。</p>
<h3 id="c219">流浪之歌 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 孟華</p>
<p>一離開曼谷，這充溢着熱帶情調的暹羅的首都，我就沒有一個時候不想到它，不想到那些會在一起流浪過的熱情的朋友。</p>
<p>我愛南國，我愛曼谷，我允愛曼谷的夏天同夏的曼谷之夜。</p>
<p>多麼可愛呵，炎夏的夜的曼谷，湄公河上的炎夏的夜呵！河水低低地唱着，輕輕地拍着船身，睡在船上，（船是我們的家，）看皎潔的月亮，看閃耀的星星，看遼廓而蔚藍的雲天。聽江水在耳畔私語，同南風送來遠處近處水手們的歌唱。</p>
<p>陰影之下，河是黑的，月光之下，河是白的。敞開的蓬窗，送進來原野六月的稻香，還有成羣的飛蛾撲着燈火，飛着拍着，團團作戲。我們等着潮來，準備起椗了。就在這時候，年老的伯伯，噙着油亮的旱烟管，用驚異的神色，抖顫的聲調，同我們講述着常他們在幾十年前，到這蠻荒之國來，跟烈火一樣的天氣，野獸一樣的土人，以及與大蛇老虎奮鬥的事蹟。那些像傳奇，像中古的英雄與武士的經歷，（這里頭充滿着汗，淚，與血服的氣息）迷醉了我們，戚動了我們，蠱惑了我們。呵。曼谷的夏之夜是美麗的，曼谷的夏之夜是神秘的。</p>
<p>我那能不愛曼谷同它的夏，夏之夜？那又那能忘記那些熱情的，在生與死的邊綫上掙扎着的朋友們？</p>
<p>我遙望着南國的雲天，祝他們康健。</p>
<p>在曼谷，我有過一些曾經一同流浪過的朋友。</p>
<p>我們是年靑而又苦難的一羣。我從新嘉坡被逐逃到暹羅來，就混在他們的隊伍里，當一名水手。我是一個年靑的教書先生，然而因為我們都是年靑，我們消除了一切的隔閡。我亦曾同他們一起到山巴里去，一天要走百發十里並不平坦的山路同水路。夜晚宿在土人的家里，靜夜里聽着「伯公」的吼聲。</p>
<p>等到「火礱」（機器輾米廠）的生意歇了之後，我們失業了。那時日里，我們把餘下的錢，拚命喝着濃烈的酒同咖啡，亦曾整夜地賭錢。直到身上沒有半個「冬」，我們就餓着肚子在街上瞎跑着，嘴里吹着流行的小調。或是走到市外廟南橋邊，站在小垃圾堆頂，聽那受難的產婦的呻吟。我們不羨慕凝固的安樂與庸俗的幸福，我們更不希求腐霉的閒適的日子，我們過的是滿含着浪漫的情趣，是緊張的而又冒險的生活。我們有獵戶樣靈活而又精明的眼睛，直視着生活，而且時時作着未來的熱烈的夜。</p>
<p>自然，在這樣的時日里，我們屢屢從生活的尖端上摔了下來，但每一次我們都崛强地爬起來，崛强地掙扎着。許多决我們都爬起來，同樣也有許多决我們在爬起來之後又被生活的大錘打擊下去。我們不倦怠亦不灰心，雖然希望時常騙去了我們許多時間，在我們生命的篇幅里塗下一大幅灰色的遺漬。</p>
<p>有一天夜里，在熱鬧的街頭走着。明亮的街燈忽然使我看淸了同伴們的臉龐，這樣，我便想到自己自然也有一頂蓬亂的頭髮，在這又髒又長的頭髮的下面，一定嵌着兩顆父黑又凹的眼晴，還有瘦削的臉龐同粗黑的髭鬚。我靜靜地想：「生活呵！」然而我竟瘋在地笑着，連身子亦搖撼了。</p>
<p>「老三，你笑什麽？」我的同伴面上露出驚異的神色。</p>
<p>「我笑生活休想壓死我們！我說。於是我們把各人袋子里剩下的錢凑攏起來，到一家「枯脾」店里去喝幾杯濃濃的</p>
<p>回到船上來，老伯伯熟睡了。月光淹着我們的船。我們邊吹着口哨，邊卸下衣服，先後地溜入河里，在微溫的河里游着泳着。</p>
<p>我們泅着，我們談着，我們唱着，當第一道海潮衝進湄公河來的時候。</p>
<p>自從那年秋初，我便離開曼谷了，到現在已經五年。我無時不想念着他們、這些會經一同流浪過的朋友。亦時常想到那滿含浪漫情趣的夏天！</p>
<p>在異國的殘酷的待遇之下，在生活的剝削之下，朋友們該流散了吧？我　望着南國的雲天，祝他們康健。</p>

<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>蓮花河里戲鴛鴦；窗外風淸，乳燕兒飛雙，兩岸竹橋－柳綠花嬌。牛背牧童橫笛奏：靑山綠水多逍遙！</p>
<p>歌聲，划過了搖顫不住的樹梢，在少女的嘴里，不知怎麽，調子總帶有說不出來的凄淸，彷彿有無限的幽怨，將要藉了這一闋詞曲，訴與那同情的人兒領略。</p>
<p>秋夏之交的時候，野籐從樹梢上斜吊下來像蛇，花葉濃密得能藏幾個人都不露踪影，野蟲唧唧地躲在草地里亂呌，月華，偸瞧着這銀色的自然。於此，亞瑪尼－那懷了凄淸的少女，悄悄地推開了房門，向四下里張望一回，忽忙的穿過了房前的小徑，讓樹葉緊遮了身子，跨上竹橋，淸麗的喊出了慣常的歌調。</p>

<p>— 高卓</p>
<p>（五）戀愛舆婚姻</p>
<p>男女授受不親，是中國的古禮，這一個封建禮教統治中國社會已有幾千年；在这種禮教下不知演過多少慘劇，憔悴了多少相愛着的男女的心．現在，一部地方的男女是得到社交的自由了，然這不知道是經過多少門爭，費了多少犧牲而獲得的。但在苗民，男女的社交自來便普徧而絕對地自由着。男女戀愛的事跡，也極盡香艷的能事。前面已經說過，苗民大都是務農的，所以青年苗民的交際與戀愛的場所，自然多在野外的田間，山上，以及森林裏。苗民很能唱歌，在田野工作時，總唱歌自娛，但却也就常常以此而作有引誘異性的工具。月，南風吹起，大麥在田裹黄了，苗民們都在郊外去工作，這時，你可以聽見隨處都有青年苗民們的高歌，聲調嘹亮而婉轉，這往往是出發於燃　着的戀情的。有時，一男一女遙遙相隔，不能望見而祇能互相聽見歌聲，最初便以情歌互相酬答，連績不已，而漸次走近，燒着如熾的情　，終於相聚在一起，而以短促的時間，達到了戀愛的最高點。</p>
<p>苗民的戀愛自由的，家長對於子女一切的行爲，也不加以阻撓。青午的男子可以公開往戀人的家裹陪伴愛人住宿過夜，但是，若到生育孩子時，便是這一對戀者的難關。因爲，按苗民的迷信，認爲在家中生育孩子不吉祥的事，若果在家分娩，必實行驅逐或給以更殘酷的處罰。所以，一至將生育時，必先在戶外去爲孕婦搭起一個臨時的草棚，暫作遮避風雨之用。</p>
<p>那是一種誘惑，經過拉哈　的門口，她總想着：茂爾包也許在里面等候着我吧？真的，整整地兩灭啦，他家里爲了怕招惹是非，看管着不准他出來。哼，看管子制不了火熱的心呵！她笑了。可是，她總沒有膽量走進廟里去，常想到看廟的那小厮擠眉弄眼的樣子，再連想到那一身臭衣服，滿嘴臭牙齒就不由得噁心，她不敢多逗留卞去，沿了圍笆，往村西走去。</p>
<p>（拉哈　，不知道命名的　　，只　　　　　　　　　年代剝年　　　　的　璜，神祇也分不出是怎樣的面貌。）</p>
<p>站在茂爾包的窗前，不見燈火，偏斜的月兒，投射看她整個的身體，一個影子緊印在窗紙上，自付着，他也許睡熟了吧?不，說不定在外面没有回來。怎樣的把這件不幸的事告訴他呢？順了小洞看一下，黑遮　了視覺，敲了敲窗子—</p>
<p>—那一個？說話的聲音顯然的是他的叔叔，一陣亂跳，趕緊把步子拉回來，往原路上奔去！身影在後面的追逐，狗不住的　　　　　犯還樣，　　橋邊得茂葉里。</p>
<p>流言，很快的傅遍了整個的山村，仿佛在唱新聞，什麽亞瑪尼和茂爾包在山根的底下發生了怎樣的趣史，什麽茂爾包被看管不准出外，又什麽一百七十塊錢把亞瑪尼押給了老黑，（因爲亞瑪尼的父親欠了老黑還不清的债）當空下來的時候，這些很容易的掛上了每個人的嘴角。</p>
<p>日子很快的溜過去，那一天亞瑪尼的堂前點遍紅燭，婦女們湊在一塊咕　着—</p>
<p>—亞瑪尼今天領過門，不久，將要做大房家小！拉哈廟的邊房一定很熱鬧。但是情愛燒透了年青人的心苗，抽一個空手，亞瑪尼偷開了後門，準備追回了過往的自由，重次的走上村西的路。那拉哈廟的小厮，突的，從廟里　出來，擋住了她的行進!—</p>
<p>—這樣夜深，到那里去？她窘了，星，擠着眼，四外還是那麼靜。</p>
<p>—看喲，亞瑪尼偷會茂爾包喲!小厮狂笑着，兩隻把掌亂拍，嚷着，從廟門前跑向村西去！</p>
<p>熟睡的人兒驚醒了，带一付張皇的神情相觑着。就在這一個夜晚，亞瑪尼被拴在拉哈廟的柱子上，皮的鞭子捲去了她的肉條，血，滴在磚地里，死上了舞鞭者的衣裳，濺到觀看者的身上。</p>
<p>消息，又迅速的傅播出去。跟着茂爾包被打發進了百里外的縣城。</p>
<p>一個月後，拉哈廟張開了盛大的筵席，亚瑪尼被彫琢得像泥菩薩一樣，擁推着，走上了廟堂。——走，去看，這是老黑收房的日子呵！</p>
<p>中弦，月色非常的明亮，北角，那花枝密茂的底下，　伏着一個壯漢子右手拿了月牙形的尖刀，在月光的底下，發着閃閃地寒光，急速的，他跨過了竹橋，摘了些枝條纏着身子，躲進廟的一角。聽聽，沒有一點聲音，悄悄地，溜到了後門，跳進屋子去，眼里暴跳着火花，他憤怒，他發狂，野獸一樣把鋒利的尖刀刺上了老黑的背脊。於是，他們相偕着，邁過了山田，立在竹橋上向河心投去，水花驚起了絕大的回　，屍身，順了平滑的河流，攤抱着向下端飄去</p>

<p>— 小綺</p>
<p>深夜朱眠，冥想便往往趁着繽紛地開綻，這比孤無意跌進蜘蛛網上．愈纏鬧愈擺脫不了的蜻蜒更加苦惱。而隨這苦惱洶湧起來的，不久將變成一些惆悵和一些輕烟樣的哀怨，稀薄地游蕩在心湖上。若是偶然自遠處有隱約沉滞的汽車的喇叭聲，落在靜肅的空氣中；或在静肅的窗外弄堂下有夜販者敲着木　　篤的聲音，與人的哭訴似的叫喊，仿佛是誰在一架破舊的　　前，彈奏着綜雜</p>

<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>無　但是凄鬱的一支歌，我是　的　　着，緩緩地，　　　我無　德　　來，甚至不值錢的眼淚因此　　的淌着。我不知道為了什麼原故，可是我此時的一顆心的確太脆弱了。似乎經不起過分劇烈的刺激。而那呌喊，那木梆的聲音，是清晰的，正好為我已經太寂寞的情　，再疊放一層悲惻的意味。</p>
<p>每夜，每夜，當我睡不着的時分，聽到了夜販者一邊敲木梆，一邊嘶着發沙的嗓子，從弄堂中走過，不久又走回來，一會兒模糊，一會兒嘹喨，我的心思亦跟着如潮汐般起伏着。於是我閉了眼睛，往腦海里摸索着，我看見一個人，挑着沉重的擔子，前面的一頭點了盞火油燈，薄弱的光芒照射在地上，這也許是沒有月也沒有星的，而高高地貼在木桿上的街燈，是為濃厚的露　所罩籠，幾乎等於沒有一樣的夜晚，這樣地拖着自家的影子，噙住一份卑微的希冀，走過冷漠的每一條街，每一條胡同，以及每一個黑越越的地方，去碰撞不可知的命運的賞賜。無論是刮大風的日子，雨雪飄搖的日子，晴放的日子，總是單個兒，一副影，和兩隻擔子，打傍晚起，一直走到更闌天亮。生活就是無窮盡的黑暗的延續。……</p>
<p>對於熟悉了的夜販者的呌喊，和木梆的聲音，它時常給予我一種與她很隔膜的憫念，同時使我想到了人合人之間勞息的距離，而這種人的生命是像生銹的爛銅片，永遠不會茁出燦爛的光彩，並且呌生的皮鞭日夕抽躂着。</p>
<p>可是他的吃得下惡毒命運所有的捉弄的勁力是值得讚美的。</p>

<p>迷途的羔羊</p>
<p>「漁光曲」歌，已是一個極流行的歌曲，這歌聲，曾瀰漫了全中國。</p>
<p>「漁光曲」歌之後，這裏又產生了一支「迷途的羔羊」歌，這歌的詞曲，都是非常之好的。</p>
<p>這支歌，由蔡楚生作詞，任光作曲，陳娟娟主唱，已由百代公司收成唱片，歌譜，現在印刷中，不日可以贈送各界。</p>
<p>下面，是「逃涂的羔羊」的歌詞：</p>
<p>月光光　照村莊，</p>
<p>村莊破落炊無糧；</p>
<p>租稅重重稻麥荒！</p>
<p>月圓圓　照籬邊，</p>
<p>籬邊狗犬不能眠；</p>
<p>饑寒交迫淚漣漣！</p>
<p>月朗朗　照池塘，</p>
<p>池塘水乾種田難；</p>
<p>他鄉流落哭道旁！</p>
<p>月亮亮　照他鄉，</p>
<p>他鄉兒郎望斷腸；</p>
<p>何時歸去插新秧？</p>
<p>月依依　照河堤，</p>
<p>河堤水决如山移；</p>
<p>家家冲散死別離！</p>
<p>月黯黯　照荒塲，</p>
<p>荒塲屍骨白如霜；</p>
<p>又聽戰鼓起四方！</p>
<p>月凉凉　照羔羊，</p>
<p>羔羊迷途受災殃；</p>
<p>天涯何處覓爹娘？</p>
<p>月明明　照天心，</p>
<p>天心不知兒漂零？</p>
<p>風吹雨打任欺凌？</p>
<p>月微微　照海水，</p>
<p>海水奔流永不回；</p>
<p>苦兒無家不得歸！</p>
<p>月　　　照破衣，</p>
<p>破衣單薄碎　　；</p>
<p>凍死道旁無人理！</p>
<p>月茫茫　照高房，</p>
<p>高房歡笑如顛狂；</p>
<p>苦兒饑餓正彷徨！</p>
<p>月慘慘　照海灘，</p>
<p>海灘無人夜漫漫；</p>
<p>苦兒血淚已流乾！</p>

<p>話言　賊下燕京。鵲亂鴉飛紫禁城。官眷大都尋短見。明君自縊壽　亭。賊兵賊將紛紛進。奸掠淫肆獸行。太液池中屍壓積。因此上。費妃自溺未曾沉。賊兵一見心歡喜。一把拖將主帥營。那賊將。名喚搖旗原姓郝。本來。時時刻刻起邪心。况且時。費妃嬌艷人間少。好如。出水芙蓉一朶輕。命他換去濕衣服。怎奈費妃不肯聽。因為。暗藏利器縫腰袴。否則，泄露機關斷不行。嬌聲對着搖旗說，我是，玉葉金枝應自尊。苟蒙主將相垂愛應當，奉旨完姻好稱心。燈下美人分外美。更兼費妃　飲若多情。喝得酩酊歸臥室。一上床，鼾聲雷動若泥人。費妃支使他人出。頓時惡向拆開縫袴雙刀出膽邊生。兩手擎來步不停。猛向賊匪當胸刺。呵呵呀，喚聲好似發雷霆，費妃惟恐遭荼毒，忙把左手鋼鋒插已身。咕咚倒地流鮮血。去追明帝見　君。剛貞勇烈人間少。况是　柔一舞人。青史芳名千古在。愧煞那，一班文武在朝臣，更比那，當年故事令人欽。</p>

<p>一部影片，無論在那一方面，是應當有它的創作，因為能夠如此，　顯得它的生命活潑，健康有力。</p>
<p>「迷途的羔羊」，確是秉着這種創作精神來　　完成的。</p>
<p>蔡楚生的對於藝術認真的態度實足可佩，他處理每一塲戲，每一個鏡頭都很審慎，所以他的作品都是需要極長的攝製時間，大量資本，可是，他的每一部作品問世，都是轟動一時。</p>
<p>「迷途的羔羊」非但是演出形式極為新穎，而內容亦極充實有力，在蔡楚生的諸多作品中，這算是一部有更高價值的東西吧。</p>
<p>蔡楚生確是戴著一副鬼臉來製作他的影片，如果看過「迷途的羔羊」，那你更會覺到他這副瞪視着現實的鬼臉兒，比較製作「漁光曲」時，是更陰沉，更惱怒得多了。</p>

<h3 id="e10">The Tragi-Comedy of the League of Nations Assembly <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— Dou</p>
<p>Recently, two unexpected events occurred consecutively within three days at the extraordinary session of the League of Nations Assembly. One was the demonstration by Italian journalists against the attendance of the former Emperor of Abyssinia, and the other was the sudden suicide of a Czech journalist inside the Assembly. Whether the two are related is unknown, but the fact that they occurred in such quick succession and their momentum is undeniable. Whether the journalists were acting in concert, intending to use these acts to appeal to the League of Nations, or whether it was merely coincidental is also unclear. While members of the League may not have felt particularly pressured, the atmosphere in the Assembly at the time was tense. The staging of this tragi-comedy is likely something that the conveners of the Assembly find regrettable and concerning.</p>
<p>The Italian journalists' demonstration was reportedly motivated by the fear that the Abyssinian Emperor's attendance at the Assembly would hinder Italy's cooperation with the League. They sought to display their remaining aggression by mocking the deposed monarch in his state of displacement. They failed to realize that the honor and dignity of the League of Nations should take precedence over their petty actions. Such unbridled behavior is hardly befitting of a major nation. Normally, such excessive behavior is only found amongst the oppressed who suffer grievances that cannot be redressed, feel that their appeals are unheard, and are driven to desperation by their inability to endure, seeking only to vent their anger. But what is the situation with Italy today? Since declaring the annexation of Abyssinia, Italy, despite the world's general disapproval, has already seized control of the actual benefits. They should have been content and refrained from making a public scene that would only make them seem to have lost control of themselves. It is no wonder that the Romanian Foreign Minister was indignant and the Parisian newspapers unanimously condemned them. The Czech journalist's attempted suicide, on the other hand, was due to the dire situation of Jews in Germany, hoping that his death would draw the world's attention. This, in contrast to the former, shows opposite results. One is actively pursuing the goal of aggression, while the other is passively seeking the extension of justice. One uses demonstration to indirectly criticize others' faults, while the other uses tragic behavior to stimulate general sympathy. In the end, both serve to increase the League of Nations' distress.</p>
<p>The League of Nations' inability to effectively restrain aggression has long been recognized by the world. Although this extraordinary session has not yet voted to lift sanctions against Italy, the general trend has already become a spent force. On the one hand, due to its own position, it cannot but struggle to salvage the crumbling situation. Thus, some advocate for reorganizing the League, while others advocate for amending the Covenant. Their state of confusion is something we cannot help but feel regretful about. Representative Gu Weijun of China wisely said, "The League of Nations' failure is not due to the uselessness of the Covenant, but to the inadequacy of the methods and strategies for implementing it." If the League of Nations had been able to impose direct and decisive sanctions on aggressive countries earlier, it would not have created today's continuous distress. Changing the course is about the League of Nations making amends from now on.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Income Tax Will Be Collected in Three Categories; Foreigners in China Will Also Pay Taxes; The Legislative Yuan Will Review It at This Morning's Session <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Income Tax Regulations will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval on the 7th. In the future, it will be collected in three categories: Salary, Profit, and Interest. Foreign nationals residing in China will also be required to pay taxes on their salary income, profit, or interest income. Because people of various countries reside in the country where the tax is levied, and the country has an income tax, they should pay in accordance with the law. Moreover, the tax rate set by China is very low, and people of various countries residing in China are quite aware of this, so it is expected that people of various countries residing in China will express their approval when it is implemented. As this tax system is newly created, one side hopes that the people will assist in the implementation, and the other side requires the collecting agency to have a complete and fair investigation. The amount of tax to be collected should be based on the exact amount of income to avoid unequal burden. In the future, it is planned to establish an arbitration committee, hiring local impartial gentlemen, business leaders, and administrative heads as arbitration committee members. If the taxpayer believes that the assessed amount is too high, they can submit it to the arbitration committee for detailed review, with fairness as the primary consideration. However, the tax amount due should still be deposited in the designated bank first. If it is indeed too high, the overcharged amount and interest will be returned to the taxpayer. Otherwise, it will be directly deposited into the national treasury. (5th Day Special Dispatch) (Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan will review important cases such as the Income Tax Regulations at this morning's session on the 7th. The tax rates for the three categories of income tax in the regulations have been drafted separately. The first category, income from profit-making enterprises, is taxed based on the ratio of income to capital, with tax rates ranging from 20 per thousand to 100 per thousand per month. The second category, income from salaries and remuneration, is taxed based on the amount of income. Those with a monthly income of less than 30 yuan are exempt from tax. Those with an income of 30 to 100 yuan, 101 to 200 yuan, 201 to 300 yuan, 301 to 400 yuan, 401 to 500 yuan, 501 to 600 yuan, and 601 to 800 yuan or more, each level of ten yuan, will be taxed at rates of one jiao, two jiao, three jiao, four jiao, six jiao, eight jiao, and one yuan, respectively. The taxation method adopts a progressive excess rate system. The third category, income from securities deposits, is taxed based on the amount of interest income. However, educational savings deposits with an annual interest income of less than 100 yuan are exempt from tax. Deposits from various levels of government agencies, statutory savings of civil servants, and the foundations of educational and charitable organizations are exempt from tax. The tax rate for this type of income has not been graded and a common standard is to be set. The exact amount is currently unknown, but it is said to be very low, with a maximum of no more than 7 percent. (5th Day Central News Agency Telegram) (Nanjing) The Central Preparatory Office for Direct Taxation has decided to select specialized talents to be responsible for important tasks such as accounting, auditing, and statistics, and will publicly select them. In the future, after the preparations are completed, it is planned to immediately establish a Central Direct Taxation Management Office.

If such an agency exists but is practically unnecessary, it should be reduced or merged as much as possible. The organizational system consists of fourteen points, all based on the bureau chief system.

It is understood that this statement is entirely speculative. It has been more than a month since Mao Xu led the remnants of the bandits to flee west, and they are still trapped in Weichong and Yuwang in southern Ningxia, surrounded on all sides. No bandit has been able to enter Suiyuan. The Ningxia garrison is determined to suppress the bandits, and the national forces on the southeast and west sides are also advancing. It is absolutely impossible for Mao Xu's remnants to flee to Xinjiang via the Suixin road or the Hexi region. (4th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e35">Resolution Passed, League of Nations Assembly Concludes, Abyssinia Votes Against, Four Countries Abstain, Request for Financial Aid Rejected <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly has today passed the resolution submitted by the Presidium for discussion. Its content is divided into three points: 1. Reaffirming the principle of non-recognition of the use of force to occupy territory, but the wording is vague and does not specifically mention Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. 2. Announcing that continuing sanctions against Italy would be of no avail. 3. Requesting the governments of all relevant countries to propose a plan to consolidate the League of Nations. This resolution was not formally passed because Abyssinia voted against it and is only considered a recommendation and filed for record. After the Assembly passed the recommendation, it discussed Abyssinia's request for a loan of 10 million pounds from the League of Nations. The voices of the representatives of various countries who spoke against it were very low, almost inaudible in the audience. Finally, it was rejected with 23 votes against and 25 abstentions. The Assembly also decided to change the date of the regular meeting from September 7th to September 21st. The Chairman of the Assembly, Qi Lan, delivered a closing speech, saying that the League of Nations has now passed a major crisis. He then announced the adjournment of the meeting, which was at 7:55 PM in the evening. (4th Day National Telegram) The Abyssinian representative looked extremely depressed when he walked out of the Assembly Hall after the Assembly adjourned. (5th Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly convened at 6:30 PM this afternoon and passed the draft resolution adopted by the Presidium this morning. Of the 49 countries present, 44 voted in favor, 1 voted against (Abyssinia), and 4 abstained (the Union of South Africa, Chile, Panama, and Venezuela). The representative of Mexico was absent. According to this resolution, the sanctions against Italy will be revoked by the Sanctions Scheme Adjustment Committee. Regarding the improvement of the operational methods of the League of Nations Covenant, each member state shall submit a proposal to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Aveenol, before September 1st. As for the financial assistance requested by Abyssinia, it has been rejected. Therefore, the League of Nations has determined to let the country take its course and is unwilling to help it. When the meeting was held today, although the Abyssinian Emperor was not present, the Permanent Bureau of the League of Nations was deeply concerned that another incident might occur, so a large number of police, in uniform or plainclothes, were deployed inside and outside the venue to strictly guard against it.</p>
<p>Abyssinian Representative Delivers Doleful Declaration After the meeting began, the Abyssinian representative stood up to read a declaration and make a final appeal. The wording was lengthy and doleful. He said, "Will the League of Nations abandon the invaded country and allow it to be slaughtered by the invading country? This is what our delegation dares not believe. The League of Nations Assembly passed a resolution on October 10th of last year, declaring Italy's crimes and judging it as an aggressor. The ironclad case is as solid as a mountain and cannot be shaken. May I ask, does this resolution conform to the previous resolution? Moreover, most of Abyssinian territory has not been occupied by Italian troops. May I ask, will the League of Nations recognize the use of force to annex territory? All of this should be clearly stated by the Assembly. The Abyssinian delegation hereby requests the Assembly to submit the two draft resolutions previously submitted by Abyssinia regarding the non-recognition of the use of force to annex territory and the request for financial assistance for discussion so as to provide a clear answer to the Abyssinian nation."</p>
<p>Result of Resolution Vote Then the representatives of Panama, Canada, South Africa, and Colombia spoke successively, expressing their grief over the current situation and saying that they hoped that the League of Nations Covenant would be amended as soon as possible. Among them, the representative of South Africa declared that when the draft resolution was submitted for voting, the country would abstain from voting. Then the Chairman of the Assembly, the Prime Minister of Belgium, Qi Lan, requested that the draft resolution passed by the Presidium be submitted for voting first. The Assembly then held a vote to pass the draft resolution.</p>
<p>Abyssinia's Proposal Ultimately Rejected The Chairman then submitted the two draft resolutions submitted by the Abyssinian delegation to the Assembly a few days ago for opinions and voting (Abyssinia's draft resolutions are: 1. Requesting the Assembly to declare its compliance with the provisions of Articles 10 and 16 of the Covenant and not to recognize the use of force to annex territory. 2. Requesting financial assistance and guaranteeing the 10 million pound bond proposed by Abyssinia). As a result, the representatives of the countries attending the Assembly did not express any opinions on the first proposal, because this issue had been resolved in the report submitted by the Presidium. As for the second proposal, namely Abyssinia's borrowing, the result of the vote was rejected by 23 votes to 1 vote (Abyssinia) and 25 abstentions. Then the work of the Assembly came to an end.</p>
<p>Chairman Delivers Closing Speech Chairman Qi Lan then stood up to deliver a closing speech, saying that much has been learned from the Assembly's process, and we dare not forget it. The work of this Assembly has been arduous and not easily understood by people. All member states have completed their work with good will and courage, which is admirable. He also said, "We have now witnessed the most serious setback of the League of Nations. However, we should still try our best to ensure that a temporary setback does not transform into a permanent failure. As for sanctions, the methods adopted by the League of Nations have not been without benefit to Abyssinia. Even the economic sanctions method, if the participating countries can adhere to it faithfully, it has given Abyssinia strong spiritual assistance. But the ultimate outcome of the war cannot be determined, because this economic measure cannot replace cannons and tanks. In short, the sanctions method has demonstrated a new spirit in international relations, but the League of Nations still needs to make more efforts to revive world economic activity. With this new spirit, we have high hopes for the future endeavors of the League of Nations." In conclusion, he said that looking at the world today, there is no other organization that can replace the League of Nations. Therefore, we must use our intelligence and wisdom to seek the future development of the League of Nations. After the Chairman's speech, the 16th League of Nations Assembly adjourned at 8:00 PM.

The Italian Minister expressed his support without any reservations. (4th Day Havas Telegram) (Rome) Political circles here generally expressed support for the form of the resolution recently passed by the League of Nations Assembly. However, they said that unless the sanctions against Italy are revoked, Italy's attitude will not change. In semi-official circles, it is also said that the continued stationing of the British navy in the Mediterranean is tantamount to military sanctions, and the country's establishment of compromises with the countries along the Mediterranean coast under the pretext of defending against Italian threats is tantamount to diplomatic sanctions. With military and diplomatic sanctions being carried out in tandem, Italy and other countries cannot be in an absolutely equal position. Therefore, it is very difficult for Italy to rejoin European events for cooperation. (4th Day Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e42">Where is the Hope of the League of Nations? The Italian-Abyssinian Case is Barely Resolved, and the Serious Dispute in Danzig Follows <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) After the meetings of the Executive Yuan and the Assembly of the League of Nations yesterday, the special correspondents of various newspapers stationed in Geneva sent messages, all saying that the scenery yesterday was the most bleak since the establishment of the League of Nations. The Italian-Abyssinian issue has been barely resolved, and the dangerous Danzig issue has followed. A reporter from the Bai Ri Bao said, "The League of Nations has suffered greatly from the Abyssinian issue in the past, and today the Danzig issue has occurred, and soon the Austrian issue will be encountered. It can be said to be extremely unfortunate." A reporter from the Daily News, Saint-Puiste, also said, "The events of yesterday can make the League of Nations lose its courage." Bertina, a reporter for the Paris Echo, compared the Abyssinian issue with the speech delivered by Greiser, the President of the Senate of the Free City of Danzig, saying, "Perhaps the future aggressor (referring to Germany) believes that the spirit of international solidarity has disappeared, and from now on, it can do whatever it wants, so it no longer hides its aggressive intentions." Mrs. Tabui, a reporter for the Business Daily, talked about Greiser's contempt for the audience in the Executive Yuan yesterday, saying, "Although this behavior can be considered a ridiculous move, it is also a tragedy, because the representatives of various countries now believe that after the recent events, the League of Nations should strictly close its doors and no longer meet the world. Some representatives have already publicly made this proposal. However, if the League of Nations closes its doors and does not accept people, the overall situation in Europe may suffer another military catastrophe." She also said that when the representatives of various countries voted on the resolution, they knew that after voting in favor, there would be others who would envy Italy's victory and rise up to follow it. Affected by this, most of these countries will become victims of war. However, those who ultimately voted in favor were also dominated by the psychology of fearing dictators. However, the Little Parisian Newspaper still believes that the future status of the League of Nations is promising, saying, "Belgian Prime Minister Qi Lan once said that the League of Nations has avoided two dangers: the danger of discouragement after failure and the danger of forcibly concealing and not admitting failure. This statement is true. In the future, when the signatories of the Locarno Treaty meet in the Belgian capital, if Italy can accept Prime Minister Qi Lan's invitation and the representatives of the three countries, Britain, France, and Belgium, can meet together, then this result alone is enough to compensate for the twists and turns that the League of Nations has experienced in the past week."

<h3 id="e43">League of Nations Mediation of the Danzig Dispute: Poland Entrusted with Mediation, Tripartite Committee Formed to Monitor Situation; Fiery Speech by Danzig Senate President, Sharp Criticism of League High Commissioner <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) Yesterday, during a League of Nations Administrative Council meeting to discuss the Danzig issue, the President of the Danzig Senate, Greiser, vehemently criticized the League High Commissioner in Danzig, Lester. Shortly thereafter, the Administrative Council unanimously passed a resolution requesting the Polish government, as the representative of the Administrative Council, to mediate the dispute between Lester and the Danzig Free City's National Socialist Party (Nazi Party). This was because Poland was responsible for handling Danzig's foreign relations according to the regulations of the Danzig Free City. After the resolution was passed, Greiser immediately stood up and gave the Nazi salute to British Foreign Secretary Eden, French Foreign Minister Delbos, and Polish Foreign Minister Beck. Many onlookers laughed. As Greiser passed by the press gallery, he initially covered his nose with his hand, and then repeatedly pointed fingers at the journalists, causing a great uproar among the reporters, who criticized him. Police then escorted Greiser out of the meeting hall amidst shouts of condemnation.</p>
<p>Earlier, the German cruiser "Leipzig" arrived in Danzig harbor, and its captain did not, as was customary, pay a courtesy call on High Commissioner Lester, causing Lester to become very angry. This led to a dispute with the local Nazi Party. Lester then reported the situation to the League of Nations, opposing the Nazi Party's attitude. The League of Nations Administrative Council then convened yesterday to consider the report. Upon hearing that Lester had lodged a protest, Greiser hurriedly flew from Berlin to Geneva, intending to enter the Administrative Council meeting room, but was denied entry because he did not have the necessary pass. This was because, following recent demonstrations by Italian journalists in the press gallery and the suicide of Czech photographer Roux in the same area, the number of guards at the venue had been tripled, and security was very strict. Greiser, being denied entry, raged loudly, but was later admitted. Greiser then addressed the Administrative Council, criticizing Lester's report for being released too early in Danzig. He stated that he was speaking on behalf of 400,000 Germans, and that Lester consistently supported minority groups against the majority. At this point, Greiser exclaimed, "Even during the Great War, I never saw corpses so riddled with injuries as those murdered by the thugs supported by Lester!" The only solution, he said, was to replace Lester with someone else, or to abolish the position of High Commissioner altogether, and have the President of the Senate report directly to the League of Nations. After finishing his speech, Greiser angrily threw his manuscript on the table, prompting loud shouts of condemnation from the press gallery.</p>
<p>The League of Nations then held a closed-door meeting and decided to form a committee composed of representatives from Britain, France, and Portugal to monitor the overall situation in Danzig. (Reuters, 5th) (Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council today discussed the Danzig Free City issue, holding two meetings. The first resolution was passed at 4:30 PM, and the second at 8:20 PM. The resolution draft was passed, entrusting Poland to investigate the circumstances of recent incidents in Danzig and report to the next meeting of the Administrative Council. The draft resolution stated: "Based on the report submitted by the League of Nations High Commissioner in Danzig, Lester, on the 30th of last month, the various incidents that occurred when the German cruiser "Leipzig" visited the Danzig Free City on the 25th of last month (referring to the captain of the ship visiting the President of the City Senate, Greiser, Polish High Commissioner Babe, and Nazi Party branch leader Forster, but not High Commissioner Lester, and Forster's declaration calling for the abolition of the position of League of Nations High Commissioner) should be considered as having international significance." The Administrative Council then held a closed-door meeting at 10:10 PM, and decided to appoint a committee composed of representatives from Britain, France, and Portugal to cooperate with Poland and set September 18 as the date for the next meeting. The meeting then adjourned. The details of today's meeting are recorded below.</p>
<p>After the Administrative Council convened at 4:30 PM, the President of the Danzig Free City Senate, Greiser, spoke first, explaining the City Senate's views on the incidents that occurred in the Free City and raising the entire issue of the Free City's existence. He stated: "What is the reason for forcibly separating Danzig from Germany? The 400,000 Germans in Danzig do not want their fate to be permanently linked with the League of Nations. I speak here on behalf of 400,000 Germans. Since its establishment, the Danzig Free City has been a focus of disputes in the European situation. Thanks to the efforts of German Chancellor Hitler and the late Polish Minister of Military Affairs Pilsudski, the Danzig situation can be resolved through direct negotiations between Germany and Poland, without the interference of League of Nations High Commissioner Lester." Greiser then vehemently attacked Lester, stating that the Nazi Party had held a majority of seats in the Danzig parliament for the past three years, but Lester disregarded democratic principles and favored the minority, using terror tactics against the majority. He was prepared to hold a referendum to put Lester's attitude to a vote, or to have the League of Nations appoint someone else to replace Lester, and to no longer interfere in Danzig's internal affairs. However, the best solution would be to abolish the position of High Commissioner altogether. While Greiser was speaking, Lester was also present in the Administrative Council and remained calm and composed, while the audience members, due to the extreme nature of Greiser's words, whispered to each other, expressing their dissatisfaction. Seeing this, Greiser slammed the documents he was carrying on the table and said, "I do not wish to see this kind of situation." At this point, the Administrative Council, with the League of Nations General Assembly about to convene, announced an adjournment.</p>
<p>The meeting continued at 8:20 PM, when Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck made a statement, saying, "Greiser's accusations against Lester are completely unfounded. I believe that the League of Nations Administrative Council should fully support Lester, and Poland is duty-bound to accept the responsibility of investigation." French Foreign Minister Delbos also said that Lester had handled the Danzig situation well and advocated entrusting Poland with the responsibility of investigation. The President of the Administrative Council, British Foreign Secretary Eden, also expressed the same opinion as Delbos, and said that the Administrative Council specifically requested that all parties concerned treat Lester with respect. Australian representative Bruce said that Greiser's attitude was sufficient to diminish the prestige of the Danzig Free City. The Administrative Council then passed the resolution draft and adjourned at 9:30 PM. Before shaking hands with Eden, Avenol, Bruce, and others to say goodbye, Greiser raised his hand to his forehead in a Nazi salute, causing another incident. When the audience members saw Greiser give this salute, they expressed their dissatisfaction. Greiser then stuck out his tongue at these individuals, with a haughty expression. The president of the International Federation of Journalists, Thurnal, stood up to protest, but Chairman Eden acted as a peacemaker, saying that he had not seen Greiser make this gesture. In any case, for the sake of the dignity of the Administrative Council, it would be best to ignore it. (Havas, 4th) (Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council yesterday discussed various novel issues and took special steps regarding the Danzig Free City issue, entrusting a committee composed of representatives from Britain, France, and Portugal to pay attention to the current situation in the Free City. As soon as the Nazi Party again staged a coup d'état, an emergency meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council would be convened to deal with it. Regarding this, Polish representatives declared this morning that Poland would not be moved by the threatening remarks made by the President of the Danzig Free City Senate, Greiser. The promises made by Poland regarding the Free City were in fact being prepared for implementation, and if necessary, several divisions of troops could be mobilized to occupy the entire Free City within six hours. In short, Poland would never accept a "fait accompli." In addition, Poland would never allow anyone to harm League of Nations High Commissioner in Danzig, Lester. Greiser knew this well and would not offend the Polish government. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Members of the Nazi Party's stormtroopers in the Danzig Free City who were on vacation were ordered to return to their posts yesterday. German army officers and soldiers who were on vacation were also recalled to their garrisons yesterday. Upon hearing this news, rumors arose in the city and spread rapidly. The tense situation of the past few weeks has become even more severe as a result. Greiser's speech yesterday at the League of Nations Administrative Council was only reprinted in full in the Nazi Party's newspaper "Vorposten" this morning. The opposition newspapers said that although Greiser made threatening remarks yesterday in the name of 400,000 Germans in Danzig, at least 250,000 of these 400,000 "honest citizens" opposed the Nazi Party's policies and had no complaints about the League of Nations and its representative Lester. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Political figures here expressed their agreement with the remarks made by the President of the Danzig Senate, Greiser, in Geneva today. They said that the City of Danzig had a long history of political experience and that its political ability had matured, as evidenced by its past achievements. At present, all affairs were being discussed directly between the City authorities and the Polish government, so the position of League of Nations High Commissioner was virtually redundant and out of date. If this position could be changed to a purely honorary one, it would be acceptable to the Free City. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The speech made by the President of the Danzig Senate, Greiser, at the League of Nations Administrative Council yesterday made a deep impression on Nazi Party members here. The newspapers expressed their indignation at the actions taken by the Administrative Council. The "Local Guidance Newspaper" stated, "The policies pursued by the diplomats of various countries, disregarding good faith, have already been declared bankrupt. They are now using the Danzig Free City issue as a cover-up. Little do they know that although the City of Danzig is small, it has the support of 67 million German people." (Havas, 5th)</p>

<p>(London) A political reporter for the Sunday Express recently stated that Parliament was about to go on recess, and that the cabinet members were planning to leave the capital for summer to escape the heat; however, the government, in view of the tense international situation, would request that all cabinet members not to stray too far from London, so as to avoid the disadvantage of slow response. The implementation of military expansion plans, especially plans for expanding the air force, would be accelerated. It was also generally believed that the government would submit a report before the House of Commons went on recess, stating that contracts had been signed for the construction of two warships with specific deadlines, and that government bonds would be issued to finance the expansion of armaments.

<p>(London) Well-informed sources recently stated that regarding the issue of amending the League of Nations Covenant, the British government would exchange views with the various Dominions in the coming weeks. A diplomatic reporter for the Sunday Times also stated that the British government's intention was that the resolutions passed by the League of Nations General Assembly should not be worded too strictly, so as not to restrict Britain and prevent it from acting freely during the regular session of the League of Nations General Assembly. Regarding the issue of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, some people in Britain now advocated recognizing it, taking the dispute between China and Japan over Manchuria as a cautionary tale: the world did not recognize "Manchukuo", but Japan resolutely recognized it, and therefore enjoyed its benefits alone.

<p>(Berlin) Observers here recently stated that although the Germans expressed their pleasure at the League of Nations General Assembly's lifting of sanctions against Italy, they were not pleased with the remarks made by some representatives regarding strengthening collective security.

The Frankfurter Zeitung stated that regional pacts, as proposed by French Foreign Minister Delbos, were a fuse for war. For the sake of Europe, rather than starting from scratch and concluding regional pacts, it would be better to restore the old concept of the Locarno Pact, because in some respects, the Locarno Pact was a good treaty.

<p>(Rome) After Air Force Minister General Valle signed an aviation agreement with the German authorities on the 26th of last month, officials here stated that according to this agreement, Germany would be allowed to establish an airfield on one of the Italian-held Dodecanese islands in the Aegean Sea. The two sides would also jointly operate aviation services between Rome, Italy, and the German North Sea coast, passing through Venice, Italy; Munich, Germany; and Berlin. (Havas, 3rd) (Paris) After Germany and Italy signed an aviation agreement on the 26th of last month, Le Matin recently reported that this agreement was valid for ten years and had significant economic and political implications. On the one hand, it stipulated that the two sides could open up aviation routes between Rome and the North Sea, and on the other hand, it allowed Germany to establish an airfield on one of the Italian-held Dodecanese islands (on the eastern coast of the Aegean Sea). "The former can cut across the aviation routes operated by France and Russia, while the latter allows Germany to gain a foothold in the Mediterranean, which is the focus of British attention."

<p>(Tokyo) The so-called important national policy, which is being reviewed with the slogan of a complete renewal of administration, only began to take shape during the Cabinet meeting on the 3rd. Starting with the three national policy proposals of the Minister of Communications (electricity), aviation, and shipping, each cabinet member will continue to put forward national policy proposals under the jurisdiction of their respective ministries. In general, the explanations by each cabinet member will be completed by the 13th. The goal is to hold a second stage of Cabinet meeting on national policy. The total amount of budget required to implement the important national policy proposals put forward by each cabinet member, only for the next fiscal year, has already been submitted. Starting with 5.25 million yen for national electricity management, 24 million yen for aviation promotion, and 15 million yen for shipping national policy, totaling approximately 45 million yen, the estimated amounts of future requests that have already been identified, including the new national defense plan of the Army and Navy, health national policy, fuel national policy, and preparatory expenses for the implementation of the eight-year compulsory education system, etc., show that the new amount required to implement important national policy reaches a huge sum of 1.2 billion yen. Therefore, the total budget for the next fiscal year will inevitably exceed 3 billion yen. However, Finance Minister Baba's plan is to limit the total amount of revenue for the next fiscal year, including government bonds, to approximately 2.8 billion yen. Plans to reorganize the tax system and increase revenue through increased taxes are also being strongly restricted due to concerns about financial instability, and are limited to the minimum possible extent. Therefore, the important national policy expenditures are bound to be greatly reduced, and how this is handled is likely to become a political issue, so its future is worth watching. (Domei News Agency, 5th) Tokyo The Ministry of Commerce and Industry's national policy proposal to the Cabinet places its emphasis on establishing a raw materials national policy, actively promoting trade, developing small and medium-sized industries, and establishing basic industries. After days of negotiations, the raw materials national policy has been decided. Its content is divided into the following sectors: Liquid Fuel Policy, Iron and Steel Policy, Artificial Wool Raw Materials Policy. The specific measures to implement this national policy are also divided into three types: Resource Development, Use of Alternative Fuels, and Rationalization of Fuel. (Domei News Agency, 5th)</p>

This means breaking down the current restrictions on the Technical Headquarters, broadly recruiting researchers, research institutions, and motivated individuals from the public, and commissioning them by the military to conduct design and research, in order to achieve a rapid development of new types of combat materials for the Army, so as to catch up with the European and American powers.

<p>In his new book, "Raw Material Tactics," British expert A. M. Neeny lists twenty-two raw materials indispensable for modern capitalist countries, of which Japan can barely self-supply only five: coal, sulfur, cadmium, tungsten, and mica. Others, such as the most important wool, cotton, iron, and oil, are mostly or entirely dependent on foreign imports. As shown in trade tables, these important raw materials account for 60% of total imports. Therefore, once foreign countries impose export bans on Japan or trade disruptions occur, Japan's industry and military will suffer a major blow.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Japanese government is intensifying its aggression against China and pursuing its "Southward Advance" policy to remedy this deficiency. For example, wool imports reached 191 million last year, but were greatly affected after trade relations with Australia broke down. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry is now encouraging the production of cotton to replace wool, conserving and restricting the use of wool, and, if necessary, buying from New Zealand, South Africa, South America, and other places. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry also plans to have farmers raise 6-7 million sheep domestically over the next 20 to 30 years to alleviate the current crisis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the South Manchuria Railway Company is planning to establish large-scale livestock farms in Harbin, and the Army's Standing Bureau is intensifying the plunder of the Mongolian plains to use the Mongolian herding people as slaves to raise sheep. Cotton is mostly imported from the United States, India, and Egypt. Of the 714 million imported last year, 371 million came from the United States, 302 million from India and Egypt, and 20 million from China. This shows that if either the United States or Britain imposes a cotton export ban on Japan, Japan will face significant difficulties. Therefore, it is actively pursuing cotton improvement projects in North China, proposing the slogan of "Industrial Japan, Agricultural China." The reason for this is to have North Chinese farmers grow cotton exclusively. Their talk of promoting agriculture, improving technology, and cultivating talent at natural science research institutes is all deceitful nonsense.</p>
<p>Turning to iron, according to last year's import statistics, ores amounted to 44 million, pig iron to 41 million, and iron plates, etc., to 165 million. Of these, 11 million of ore and 18 million of pig iron were imported from China and "Manchuria," while the rest largely depended on European and American countries and territories within their spheres of influence. This is also a concern for Japan. Therefore, since plundering the Northeast provinces, it has been conducting so-called autonomy schemes in North China provinces, aiming at the large iron ore deposits in Shanxi province, in addition to the famous coal mines. As for oil, last year's imports amounted to as much as 150 million, mainly from the United States and the Dutch East Indies. Because this is one of the raw materials that Japan needs most and lacks the most, in addition to plotting to seize oil and iron mines in Shanxi and other places, it is also actively promoting research and production of coal liquefaction domestically.</p>
<p>The above describes the underlying reasons for Japan's continuous invasion of China under the smokescreen of economic cooperation, to solve its raw material panic. However, Japan's ambitions and conspiracies do not stop there. It not only wants to plunder China's resources to satisfy its insatiable greed, but also covets the islands of the South Seas. Therefore, in addition to the Army's "Northward Advance" policy, the Navy's "Southward Advance" policy is also being actively pursued, aiming to plunder the resources of the South Seas by various means. The South Seas Development Company and the Taiwan Development Company are pawns in realizing this conspiracy, and the brewing of a South Seas Bureau within the Colonial Affairs Ministry is a manifestation of this conspiracy becoming more concrete.</p>
<p>In short, Japan is a country with inherent deficiencies and poor resources. To dominate East Asia, it does not hesitate to use various plundering methods to obtain economic satisfaction from abroad. Regardless of any peaceful strategies towards China or the South Seas, behind the mask lies a hideous and terrifying face. However, China is its largest target, and it employs particularly numerous soft and hard tactics. If we do not want to survive, then so be it. Otherwise, shouldn't we rise up to defend our remaining resources and strive for self-reliance?</p>

<p>(London) Walter Citrine, Secretary-General of the British Trades Union Congress, recently visited Soviet Russia for five weeks and has now returned. He has published a work entitled "I Seek Truth in Soviet Russia," in which he concludes: "Soviet Russia deeply fears a German-Japanese pincer attack, even more so than before. Therefore, on the one hand, it is striving to promote a policy of compromise, and on the other hand, it is striving to strengthen national defense in order to prepare for contingencies. The country's military budget for this year is more than double that of last year. Soviet Russia is not only seeking support from the working class, but also wants to enlist the help of capitalist countries. It is true that Soviet Russia does not want to provoke a war, but if the aggressive policies pursued by German leader Hitler are not stopped by the solidarity of the countries concerned, war will eventually break out. If Soviet Russia is attacked by Japan in the Far East and simultaneously attacked by Germany in Europe, its situation may become desperate. Although I do not have specialized knowledge to evaluate the strength of Germany, Japan, and Russia, based on what I have seen and heard, I can say that if war breaks out only in 1938, Hitler will surely suffer a disastrous defeat, just as Napoleon I did before in 1812."

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in Guizhou Province, military expenditures have been huge, and the province has suffered economic difficulties, which has greatly affected the province's finance and banking. Due to the difficulty of remittances, most transactions in the commercial arena have been suspended. Because all remittances from Wuzhou to outside the province must be approved by the Foreign Exchange Committee, and each store is only allowed to remit 300 yuan out of the country, goods imported into the province are often delayed. As for export goods, wood oil, tea oil, oranges, star anise, rosin, camphor, cassia bark, Polygonum multiflorum, fragrant melon seeds, cloud ears, green hemp, cowhide, and dried ginger have always been the main items. Most of the exports are established in Hong Kong. Recently, due to the drop in Guizhou currency and soaring prices, sales have been greatly reduced. Recently, most of the merchants in the Guangxi gang in Hong Kong have suffered losses. As for Wuzhou, since the suspension of business by various silver and money shops, banknotes from outside the province and foreign countries can no longer be exchanged, and foreign exchange is handled by the Guangxi Bank. As for export goods, since June 20, all shipments must be reported to the Guangxi Provincial Bank for payment, and the bank will issue a bill of exchange before they can be transported for export. It seems that exports are difficult in this way, and sales are reduced as a result. The province's finances are becoming tighter. At the same time, due to the drop in Guizhou currency, foreign exchange rates have skyrocketed. The highest record for foreign exchange rates is 400 yuan of Guizhou currency for every 100 Hong Kong dollars. The Guizhou authorities, in order to maintain Guizhou currency due to its drop, issued copper coin notes in Nanning to adjust the shortage of copper coins in the market. It was approved by the provincial government to issue a total of 30 million copper coin notes starting from early July, with 1 million notes of 10 coins each and 4 million notes of 5 coins each. In order to maintain the commercial arena, the Nanning Price Assessment Committee convened a meeting on the 27th to discuss ways to adjust food, raise the prices of daily necessities, and re-evaluate various prices as follows: High-quality rice 14 yuan per 100 catties, medium-quality rice 13 yuan or less per 100 catties, low-quality rice 12 yuan or less per 100 catties, shipped high-quality rice 13 yuan or less per 100 catties, medium-quality rice 12 yuan or less per 100 catties, and broken rice 11 yuan and 50 cents or less per 100 catties; firewood, dry pine firewood 1 yuan and 40 cents or less per 100 catties, dry miscellaneous firewood 1 yuan and 10 cents or less per 100 catties; peanut oil 70 cents or less per catty, medium-quality raw oil 65 cents or less per catty; salt, high-quality white cooked salt 22 cents per catty, broken salt 20 cents or less per catty; pork 64 cents or less per catty, beef 50 cents or less per catty, and semi-fat pork 45 cents or less per catty.

<p>National Economic Council Plans to Organize the East and West Zhejiang Canals - After the Plan is Completed, Giant Ships Can Sail Directly to the Yellow River and Yangtze-Qiantang River Basins of Hebei and Shandong, and Inter-River Navigation Will Also Be Possible</p>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: The canal starts from Hang County, Zhejiang Province, passes through Jiangsu and Shandong, and ends in Tianjin, Hebei, covering a length of 2,210 kilometers. It is an important route for north-south shipping. It has been carefully managed and operated in past dynasties to maintain shipping and provide irrigation. It is indeed an important construction project. Since the Qing Dynasty stopped shipping and the management of dams was ineffective, the Yangtze River and the Yellow River have lost their organization, and the canal waterways have been mostly interrupted. Frequent droughts and floods have caused agricultural land to suffer from natural disasters from time to time, and shipping has also declined day by day. Therefore, in the early years of the Republic of China, the government deeply felt the importance of the canal and repeatedly hired British and American water conservancy experts to engage in design and organization, but due to the country's many troubles and financial difficulties, it has not been realized. Since the establishment of the North China, Huai River, Yellow River, Taihu Lake, and Yangtze River water conservancy agencies, the organization of the country's major rivers has begun to be carried out. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the construction departments of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces jointly formed the Canal Discussion Conference in Nanjing, hired responsible personnel, and engaged in planning, so that the entire north-south canal could become a modern waterway. After the completion of this plan, the most important benefits can be divided into the following aspects: The shipping of the Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Qiantang River basins can be connected, and north-south products can be exchanged with each other due to the convenience of transportation. After the transportation is convenient, the goods will flow smoothly, and the social economy can also develop year by year. The banks of the canal are all farmland, and after organization, drainage and water supply will be more convenient, and droughts and floods can be relieved, and the benefits are even more difficult to estimate.</p>
<p>Zhejiang West Canal Organization Measures: The entire canal organization project can be divided into five sections for construction: Tianjin-Beijing, Tianjin-Yellow River, Yellow River-Huai River, Zhenjiang-Suzhou, and Suzhou-Hangzhou. The sections within the territory of Jiangsu and Shandong have been organized since the 23rd year of the Republic of China. The Suzhou-Hangzhou section is the hub for connecting the Yangtze River and the Qiantang River, and because construction is easier, it has been included in the first phase of the project. The Zhejiang section of the Suzhou-Hangzhou section is listed below: (A) The standard of the canal body, according to the regulations of the Canal Discussion Conference, the minimum cross-section is 16 meters wide at the bottom, the bank slope is 1:2, and the water depth is 3 meters, in order to allow ships with a displacement of 300 tons to pass; (B) The Zhejiang section of the Suzhou-Hangzhou Canal is 107 kilometers long from Wangjiangjing Town, the border between Jiangsu and Zhejiang, to Gongchen Bridge in Hangzhou. The estimated organization cost is more than 700,000 yuan; (C) From Gongchen Bridge, the end point of the canal, to the provincial capital, there are seven or eight kilometers, and there are still twelve kilometers from the Qiantang River. For the sake of communication, it is planned to open up a navigable waterway from the north of Gongchen Bridge Town, passing through the east of the provincial capital to the Jiangbian four kilometers downstream of Sanlang Temple, and set up a relatively complete ship lock and an inland river wharf at the junction with the river. The total cost of various projects is more than one million yuan. According to the National Economic Council, the total cost of the Suzhou-Hangzhou section of the canal is 2.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Zhejiang East Canal Development Plan: The Zhejiang East Canal runs 79 kilometers east from Xixing to Cao'e Town, crosses the Cao'e River, and runs 32 kilometers east from Baiguan to Yuyao. From here eastward, it can pass through the Yao River, Yong River, and reach the Ningbo seaport, which is an extension line of the Jiangnan Canal operated during the Southern Song Dynasty, with a total length of 170 kilometers. The National Economic Council has now designated it as a waterway in urgent need of organization, and the plan has also been formulated. It is 79 kilometers long from Xixing to Cao'e, and the standard cross-section should be dug to a volume of 4,900,000 cubic meters. It is 32 kilometers long from Baiguan to Yuyao, and the volume of earth to be dug is 6,400,000 cubic meters, and it is planned to set up large-scale ship locks in Xixing, Cao'e, Baiguan, Yuyao and other places. After the implementation of this plan, passengers and goods can directly reach Hangzhou, and the agricultural products of the Qiantang River basin and the Zhejiang West Canal will also be more convenient to transport to domestic and foreign countries. Yang Jian, a technician from the Zhejiang Construction Department, was ordered to depart to survey and develop the route of the Zhejiang East Canal and has now returned to Hangzhou. He has specially reported the details of the survey of the Zhejiang East Canal along the line to the Zhejiang Construction Department, which will forward it to the National Economic Council for appropriation of funds for construction.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Excellent Deeds in the Southern Tour <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Shi Ying</p>
<p>Transportation in Zhejiang</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province, located in the central part of China's coastal provinces, benefits from the generous gifts of nature. It has a suitable climate, fertile land, abundant resources, and a superior culture, and has always been known for its prosperity and progress. Since the 18th year of the Republic of China [1929], the authorities have been determined to develop transportation. Examples include the expansion and opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the active construction of the Qiantang River Bridge, the steady progress of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway project, and the separate completion of highways in various counties to connect with the network of highways in seven provinces. Such rapid progress is indeed unmatched by construction in other provinces. In addition, there is the Beijing-Quzhou Railway, which is currently under construction. The route bypasses the provincial capital and heads south, passing through She County (Huizhou) in Anhui and connecting directly to Yaxian, the midpoint of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The geographical application of this railway is very similar to the recently completed Suzhou-Jiaxing Road. However, in terms of rapid transportation for the central government's national defense, the Beijing-Qu Railway is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province's transportation is so developed that the local area is suffering many adverse effects. First, the dumping of foreign industrial products on remote counties and villages will be even more powerful, stretching straight into every county and village's veins. The silk weaving industry, famous both domestically and internationally, including the so-called "Hangzhou Silk," "Huzhou Crepe," and "Shuluo," which has always sold well in markets outside the province and abroad, has recently been severely impacted by Japanese rayon, and its decline is already visible. Recently, smuggling has been rampant in North China, and rayon has moved south to steal and plunder, first invading the base of the silk industry in western Zhejiang, and soon reaching remote counties such as Jiangshan in eastern Zhejiang (the Jiangshan business community has expelled smugglers from the area). This is naturally due to the assistance of transportation.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the future, the convenience of transportation can increase efficiency in deploying politics and military affairs. Moreover, the counties in Zhejiang Province that border Fujian, Jiangxi, and Anhui have been subjected to the baptism of communism not long ago. If there is a sudden change there, soldiers from Hangzhou or other important cities can respond in a few hours and engage in suppression to prevent a resurgence. However, with the new construction and opening of each highway or railway, tens of thousands of boatmen and porters immediately lose their jobs. Of course, some will be absorbed by the transportation industry, such as porters at stations and road maintenance workers, but this only accounts for a very small number. The vast majority of the unemployed are strong laborers. After hitting walls everywhere, they will naturally resort to a life of wandering and looting. In the mountainous counties of eastern Zhejiang, people often use homemade hand grenades to engage in kidnapping, succeeding nine times out of ten. This is not accidental.</p>
<p>Moreover, the development of transportation is certainly advantageous for military transport in suppressing large groups of communist bandits, but there is no guarantee that it can be used to eliminate scattered bandits who have broken up into smaller units. Because cars cannot chase after bandits to climb mountains and cross ridges, traversing dangerous terrain with ease. Moreover, the formal official army cannot fight and chase the bandit army at the same time, leading them into dead ends and suffering great losses for small gains. Bandits can even travel without food, while the official army's march requires at least several loads of official documents. For example, if bandits are spotted in a certain mountain or village, someone reports it to the nearby garrison. The garrison must first report to their superiors and send people to investigate the situation before mobilizing. The bandit army will not wait for a gift, so wouldn't they have already slipped away? Therefore, a security commander in eastern Zhejiang said, "The difficulty of suppressing residual bandits is like trying to catch fleas, which is more difficult than fighting a tiger." However, this statement does not address the root cause of the problem. The reporter spoke with several locals in the bandit-adjacent areas of eastern Zhejiang and asked them what kind of people were most likely to become bandits. The answer can be summarized as: "Bandits are people in distress, and people in distress are the common people. Too many common people have nothing to eat, and bandits will not be suppressed." This simple and honest statement is a penetrating remark that traces the cause of banditry.</p>
<p>On the bustling streets of Hangzhou, among the crowds of people coming and going, a closer look reveals many vagrants wandering aimlessly yet expectantly. Looking at their distressed appearances, if someone were to kindly pat them on the shoulder and call out, "Friend, did you come from the countryside to look for work? A certain factory is hiring!" then they would immediately rejoice and shed tears. Although the situation of unemployed vagrants in Hangzhou is similar to that in Shanghai, there are very few cases of robbers and kidnappers. This is due to the benefit of Hangzhou not having a foreign concession. There are also a considerable number of rickshaws on the streets, especially at wharves, stations, or hotel entrances. Without you calling out "rickshaw," they will often rush up and surround you. However, when you designate a rickshaw and negotiate the price, the others will gradually withdraw. It is rare to see rickshaw pullers in Hangzhou, especially in Nanjing and Guangzhou, desperately fighting for business, with one pulling while the other refuses, and one forbidding the other to pull, while a third person, smiling, drags the passenger away. When business is slow in the evening, they (the rickshaw pullers in Hangzhou) intentionally or unintentionally put down their empty rickshaws and sit on the footboards, gathering to talk. Those near the station, wharf, or lakeside will also be joined by boatmen and porters, one by one, happily. When they see a policeman passing by or strangers noticing them, they will vigilantly pick up their tools (rickshaw or carrying pole) and start talking about business. Therefore, I feel that there seems to be some kind of tacit understanding and understanding between them, perhaps a new type of solidarity, habit, and potential. People who are familiar with this place probably wouldn't mind.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the problem of lack of employment for laborers, let's talk more generally about other aspects. Hangzhou, thanks to the beautiful and tranquil West Lake and the blessing of the many famous mountains and temples around the lake, attracts countless people with legal tender to adjust the market every spring tourism season. It is said that the weather was abnormal this spring, with flowers blooming at different times, as if Xizi [West Lake] deliberately kept the spring for a while longer, so it attracted more tourists than in previous years. However, when you ask the owners of hotels, shops, and specialty stores afterwards, did you earn a few extra dollars this year? Nine out of ten will still shake their heads at you. Although there are many twists and turns in this, the overall answer is to ask the customs surplus Mr.</p>
<p>The majority of the people of Zhejiang Province are engaged in agriculture. Because the land is naturally endowed, the lives of farmers are quite comfortable. However, since the 9th year of the Republic of China [1920], they have been subjected to frequent warlord civil wars and frequent taxes, and the farmers' security and economic foundation have been gradually shaken. In particular, the drought and locust plagues of the previous year left the guest townships with no harvest, and the rayon attack broke through the walls of the rural silk industry, making the rural economy irretrievable. With 50 million mu of arable land in the province supplying the consumption of more than 21 million people, it is no wonder that foreign rice and flour must be imported to supplement the supply. If no remedy is sought for this in the long term, will the path to survival not become narrower and narrower?</p>
<p>The coastal counties are originally lands of fish and salt, but unfortunately, the salt tax has always been very heavy, especially in recent years. This has conversely stimulated the wind of smuggling, which is also increasing day by day. In order to increase and fix the tax amount, the salt affairs office often entrusts one or two salt merchants to take charge. Salt merchants, fearing that they will not make substantial profits, can only work hard to combat smuggling. Moreover, due to improper salt inspection procedures, they often provoke extreme public anger. If ambitious people take the opportunity to incite the public, who dares to say that this is not a major disaster? When Zheng Banqiao was the magistrate of a certain county, he once escorted salt smugglers to the salt shop and drew a few orchids and bamboos on the funny instruments of torture, which attracted crowds to watch. The salt merchants could not do business and repeatedly pleaded for mercy, so he released the smugglers with a smile. It can be seen that salt merchants who exploit the middle ground have never been welcomed. If the government can find a way to reduce one cent of exploitation on salt, it will invisibly release one cent of public resentment and alleviate one cent of public hardship. If there is no great profit to be made from smuggling, it can be expected to disappear, which is a secondary matter.</p>
<p>In short, the development of transportation construction in Zhejiang, which allows for convenient connections with the highway networks of seven provinces, will certainly be of great use in terms of so-called internal security or national defense. However, in terms of developing the economy, in the current situation of rural bankruptcy, commercial exhaustion, foreign goods flooding the market, and the shrinking of indigenous industries, there is currently no great benefit to speak of. The unusually light freight traffic on major trunk lines such as the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is one proof of this. However, this is due to the limitations of objective political and economic conditions, and not to defects in the transportation system itself.</p>

<p>The Wu County Party Department, having previously received a secret report stating that Ni Songyun, Wu Mou, and others in the coal industry were secretly contacting Japanese merchants to transport and sell stolen coal, Special Commissioner Sun is currently investigating. It is said that some clues have already been found. There are more than ten people involved in smuggling, and 600 tons of Liujiang coal have been sold in two months. The Coal Industry Association, in view of this, specially convened a meeting of fellow traders at the association at 10 a.m. on the 5th to discuss solutions. On the spot, it was decided to organize an anti-smuggling committee to investigate whether fellow traders were transporting and selling Liujiang coal. As for the disciplinary measures, they still need to be carefully considered.</p>

<p>Recently, moldy rain has been continuous in Suzhou. The day before yesterday (4th) was rainy all day and night, and the river water rose sharply. At about 11 p.m. that day, when the rain was pouring, the fire-prevention wall of the Jusha Nunnery in Ganjiangfang, in the city suddenly collapsed, collapsing the Gu family's house along the Yanqiao Xiatang River. The house was inhabited by seven men, women, and children, who were all crushed under the rubble in their sleep. As a result, all were injured. Neighbors then worked together to rescue the seven people from the rubble and send them to the hospital for treatment. Fortunately, none were in mortal danger. Yesterday (5th), the Gu family homeowner was in negotiations with the Jusha Nunnery.</p>

<p>Boat households from Laogang, Xindun, and other villages in the first district, mistakenly hearing rumors that after the registration of ships in this county is completed, they will have to pay four jiao per year and four jiao each time, were panicked. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, hundreds of people gathered in the city to petition the county government, and the situation was tense for a while. Zhang, the county magistrate, and Xu, the member of the county party department, came forward to explain that ship registration is carried out in accordance with provincial orders, and registration can provide protection. The fee is only one jiao and four corners, and the registration has already ended. If there are any cases of extortion under false pretenses, they can be handed over to the law for handling. A notice was posted, and the boat households dispersed in understanding.</p>

<p>Shen Shunyuan from Jiangyin, 26 years old, was a partner in the Tianlun Cloth Factory in Niantuo Corner, this county. He was usually cautious. Unexpectedly, the factory recently reduced expenses and dismissed Shen. In his anger and frustration, Shen once sought pleasure. Recently, because he could not return to his hometown, he lived in the Nanfang Hotel outside the South Gate on the 3rd night. Unexpectedly, Shen wrote several suicide notes and then took poison to commit suicide. The next morning, the tea servant noticed it and reported it to the accountant, who sent him to the County Hospital. Several suicide notes were found, and a letter to the cloth factory owner was the most painful. At the moment, Shen's life is in danger, the cloth factory is unwilling to take responsibility, and the family cannot be notified for a while, so all parties feel quite troubled.</p>

<p>After the smuggling case at the station in this county occurred, it caused a sensation. A large number of employees have been dismissed and demoted by the two-railway management offices, as reported in this newspaper. Now, it is learned that Shi Jintang, the deputy stationmaster who was ordered to be dismissed, was wrongly accused of never participating in the case. Therefore, on the day of his dismissal, he took a train to Shanghai to visit Xiao Weiguo, the chief of the traffic section of the Management Bureau, to appeal for injustice and request a thorough investigation into whether he had harbored smugglers to clear his name. He also said that if there is solid evidence, he is willing to accept the old law. Mr. Dang diligently ordered Mr. Shi to return to Wuxi and await the . At the same time, Deputy Stationmaster Wang, Zhou Qinhuang, Special Site Supervisor Luo Fenchu, and Freight Building Director Ma Ziliu also went to Shanghai together to appeal to the Party Departments of the two railways and the relevant authorities, requesting a speedy investigation to reveal the truth.

<p>The Transportation Industry Association of this county specially convened an emergency meeting yesterday to prevent smuggling. The chairman was Shao Baochu. The discussion was: 1. Smuggling incidents have become increasingly serious in recent days. Our industry is responsible for transportation, and we fear that there will be people who are greedy for profit and disregard the overall situation, secretly transporting goods. How should we effectively prevent the case? It was resolved that each company should inform the joint transport companies of the Beijing-Shanghai-Tianjin-Pukou stations that they absolutely refuse to transport smuggled goods, pay close attention to being confused by passenger homes, and organize anti-smuggling groups. Each company should monitor each other. If smuggled goods are found, they should immediately report them without avoiding suspicion, to protect the overall reputation.</p>

<p>The Xiangshan bandit leaders Shen Heming, Zhou Axing, Lai Gentu, and others led more than 200 bandits to harm the local area, and the situation was extremely cruel. They raped as many as 25 women and looted six or seven villages. People ran around and appealed, but no troops have been sent to suppress them. As a result, people are panicked and quite a few have moved to other places. It is now learned that the Xiangshan Association in Shanghai cannot sit idly by while their hometown is suffering from a catastrophe. Yesterday, they sent telegrams to the Yin District Security Office and the Administrative Inspector's Office, urging them to send troops to suppress the bandits as soon as possible to stabilize the local area and appease the people.</p>

<p>The Provincial Security First Detachment, stationed in the old school building on Cangshui Street in this port, has more than 80 soldiers. At about 1 a.m. the day before yesterday, a soldier from the team, Lu Yongfu, saw a monster like a cow in his sleep, galloping and jumping. Lu woke up in shock and shouted, and the soldiers sleeping with him were startled and went mad, as if they had received an emergency assembly order from their superiors. They carried their guns and climbed onto the roof from the windows, running across the ridge. Shops and residents in the Beida Road area were startled and suspected that something had happened. Later, they saw many soldiers standing on the roof, which was even more surprising. The team leader then issued a standing order, and they woke up and returned to the team. When asked, they were all at a loss. One soldier fell from the building during the chaos and was seriously injured.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Grand Celebrations for the Past Two Days: Mr. Yu Recollects His 55 Years in Shanghai; Seven or Eight Hundred Guests Attend the Magnificent Theatrical Performance <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Ningbo Association in Shanghai held a grand celebration for Mr. Yu Qiaqing's 70th birthday and his 55th anniversary of living in Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, a grand ceremony took place at the association's premises. Approximately seven to eight hundred dignitaries and fellow townsmen attended. During the meeting, Mr. Yu Qiaqing recounted his experiences over the past 55 years in Shanghai, followed by speeches from guests and a magnificent theatrical performance. Details are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Hall Decorations</p>
<p>A tall paifang (ceremonial archway) stood at the entrance of the association. Police officers were dispatched to maintain order at the entrances and exits on Lloyd Road. The corridor leading to the hall was adorned with numerous banners from various parties, reflecting red light and reaching the hall's surroundings. Chairman Lin inscribed "Flourishing Fortune and Longevity" as a tribute. Other couplets were abundant and pleasing to the eye. Golden and silver gifts were displayed on both sides of the hall, creating a magnificent scene. In the center was a cake presented by the association's staff, towering over six feet in height, truly gigantic. The meeting was held in the lecture hall on the second floor, and the banquet was on the third floor, both perfectly decorated.</p>

<p>Celebration Ceremony</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM, the meeting commenced with the ringing of a bell. Guests entered and took their seats in order, observing proper etiquette. Chairman Fang Jiaobo delivered a speech first, recorded by Yang Youlong. The entire assembly paid respects to Mr. Yu Qiaqing. Following the greetings, Mr. Yu Qiaqing reported on his experiences over the past 55 years in Shanghai. His speech was concise, touching on historical materials related to the Shanghai Gazetteer. Finally, Wu Zhihao, He Dekui, Chen Renhe, Zhang Yongni, Feng Zhenwei, and others delivered eulogies. A group photo was then taken to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu's Recollection</p>
<p>Qiaqing came to Shanghai at the age of fifteen. At that time, there were no houses in Hongkou; only Ren Zhi Li and Qing Yun Li existed. There were only three bridges across the Suzhou Creek, whereas now there are twelve. At that time, foreigners organized small companies outside the Waibaidu Bridge, charging each person two copper coins to cross the bridge. Land prices were extremely low at that time. Land along the Huangpu River cost only five thousand yuan per mu, while other land cost three hundred yuan. The Tianhou Temple was located in Xiaodongmen and later moved to North Henan Road, financed by the Chaozhou community. Qiaqing was involved in this. The concessions were originally called "settlements" and were not very large. After two expansions, they reached their present state. Hongkou was originally the American Concession. Because it did not conform to their principles, it was not developed. Later, the Germans came and proposed changing the country's name, which led to it becoming the International Settlement. The Municipal Council flag was originally a collection of the national emblems of thirteen countries. The British and French concessions had different natures; the British were a "Settlement," and the French were a "Concession." All places were later collectively referred to as "concessions" without distinction. This was a mistake made by the Zongli Yamen (foreign affairs office). The Municipal Council's regulations were based on the Yangjingbang Regulations, established by the Shanghai Daotai and consuls of various countries. Thirty-five years ago, the treatment of Chinese people was extremely unfair. Parks and racetracks were not allowed to enter. The most ridiculous thing was that there were no automobiles at that time, only horse-drawn carriages. If a Chinese carriage passed a foreign carriage, they would be fined twenty-five taels of silver. On the sidewalks of the main roads, if a Chinese person accidentally bumped into someone, they would be beaten with a stick. At that time, Chinese people did not dare to take any action. The Chinese movement began with the Siming Gongsu (Ningbo Guildhall) case. At that time, Zhong Fangchong was the Fangbo (governor). Zhu Baosan, Shen Zhongli, and Qiaqing oversaw the matter, erecting a stele inscribed in Chinese and French at the corner of the Ningbo Road Guildhall in the French Concession. The next case was the Zhou Shengyou case. Zhou was mistakenly killed by an officer of a Russian warship at the Bund's bronze statue wharf. A strike was organized in support, and the German consul mediated, resulting in the dismissal of the officer responsible. The third case was the disturbance at the public court, the Li Huangshi case. Patrolmen were originally not allowed to carry guns. After this incident, they were all required to carry guns, and a rule was implemented that they could fire if there were ten or more people. At that time, the Five Ministers were abroad, causing a strike in Shanghai, creating a very serious situation. A suggestion was made to the Municipal Council to hand over the defense of the concession to Chinese control, pending the arrival of Zhou Yushuai, the Governor-General of Liangjiang, to resolve the situation. Qiaqing consulted with Guan Jiongzhi, the judge of the Mixed Court, and requested five hundred troops from Shanghai Daotai Yuan Haiguan to maintain order for three hundred nights, which resulted in a very satisfactory outcome. The issue of Chinese directors was raised with the Municipal Council at that time, requesting more Chinese directors. The Municipal Council authorities only agreed to Qiaqing joining, but later feared that Chinese people would demand the same, and the previous proposal was shelved. Qiaqing was only given a gold watch as a souvenir. Next came the May Fourth Movement, followed by the May 30th Movement. Later, foreigners realized that cooperation between Chinese and foreigners was essential. Therefore, three Chinese directors were added, then two more, for a total of five. The current image is very good. The Jiangwan Racecourse had seventy mu of land, approved by Governor-General Duanwu of Liangjiang. For the first fifteen of the fifty-five years, things were very good, completely following the Yangjingbang Regulations. For twenty-five years, it was completely abandoned by the Chinese government. In the last ten years, with the sympathy of the public, there has been a gradual hope of revival. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps, through the personal example of Qiaqing, Hu Jimei, Yuan Hengzhi, and others, and after several negotiations, was finally allowed to formally join. It has been more than twenty years since then, and the performance has been the best among all teams. He continued to discuss the situation of overseas renovations, emphasizing that establishing industries was essential. Among industries, banks and shipping companies were the most important. Qiaqing first established the Siming Bank and Ning Shao Steamship Company, with the original intention of developing foreign finance and shipping as the main focus. The way people treated others was mostly putting themselves first. This was wrong. Qiaqing advocated the opposite, believing that if everyone else was good, he would naturally be good. Therefore, he planned to prioritize the hometown before the nation in social undertakings. At the age of twenty, Qiaqing had a vision that if he could raise five million yuan, he could complete the predetermined plan. Later, due to the rise in Shanghai real estate prices, he actually reached this amount. With the main purpose of prioritizing the hometown before the nation, he gradually sold off properties to seek development for his hometown, spending more than three million yuan. By last year, it had yielded substantial results. Ningbo native products exported through commercial ports had to pay export taxes. Those that could be used as inland ports were only Dinghai and Chuanshan on Zhoushan Island. However, Chuanshan could not accommodate large ships. Therefore, the construction of the Longshan Pier and the construction of dams cost more than two million yuan, but it could only accommodate small ships. Therefore, he devised a plan to build highways and establish inland port docks in Zhenhai. The Zhenhai port boundary, starting from Jinji and Zhaobin Mountains, was originally set by the British when they first occupied Dinghai, fearing that it would have an impact. Therefore, this boundary was set. After more than six months of negotiations with the Inspector General of Customs, and using the Shanghai port boundary as a ratio, the goal was finally achieved. Ningbo flowers exported had to pay a tax of one yuan and sixty-eight cents, and transportation costs were more than two yuan. After arriving in Shanghai, they could not be compared with flowers from other regions. At that time, it took more than twenty days for transportation to Shanghai. Now, it takes one day. Considering this aspect alone, the people of Sanbei can save more than six hundred thousand yuan each year. This matter was discussed with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. He pointed out that since our hometown already has an inland port situation, not only would Zhejiang people benefit, but even the cargo transport from the entire province of Jiangxi could also be exported from Zhenhai. From this perspective, the relationship is indeed quite significant. Qiaqing came to Shanghai with only five yuan. His father's salary at that time was only ten yuan per month, so he remained consistent with the idea of frugality. Unlike the current college students and returned students, it costs more than twenty thousand yuan to train one person. Qiaqing's purpose in life is to uphold trustworthiness. This year, Qiaqing is seventy years old, and the main purpose he holds is still to prioritize public interests. If the public benefits, then personal interests will naturally follow. One must not think only of oneself; if one only cares about oneself, it will inevitably lead to failure and the inability to recover the original state. This point is what I admire. I advise all of you guests that it is best to engage in industry, which is also for the sake of your descendants. Leaving cash to your descendants, if they are unworthy, they will immediately squander it all. Industry is ultimately more difficult, and industry is ultimately for the livelihood of many people. Finally, let me say a few more words: we must ensure that everyone in the country has food to eat so that the country can be stable. And the general public must work hard. Today, I am very honored and very happy that you have come in this hot weather. As for all of you wishing Qiaqing a happy birthday, I am ashamed that I am not worthy. I only hope that all of you are healthy and strong, and that we can gather together again in ten years.</p>
<p>Niu Tisen's Words: Today is Mr. Qiaqing's 70th birthday. I came to Shanghai specifically to participate in the birthday celebration. I was very impressed after hearing Mr. Qiaqing's report on his successful journey. Mr. Qiaqing has been striving in Shanghai for fifty-five years. Creating industries is all related to the local area. The most related thing is Mr. Qiaqing's establishment of the Sanbei Company. China's coastline occupies more than seven provinces. The shipping industry should be promoted. Mr. Qiaqing, as a citizen, developed the shipping industry and achieved such results, which is truly commendable. In the future, if the shipping industry achieves success, it should be attributed to Mr. Qiaqing. The National Government established its capital in Nanjing, which was personally decided by Sun Yat-sen. The Xinhai Revolution first occupied Nanjing, which allowed the organization of a provisional government. This matter is very related to Mr. Qiaqing. During the Xinhai Revolution, the Ninth Town of the New Army stationed in Beijing was quite inclined towards the revolution, but its strength was insufficient and it almost failed. At that time, Mr. Xu Guqing was the commander, and I also participated in the matter. After making an appointment with the chief of staff of the army, we went to Mr. Qiaqing's residence on Haining Road. Mr. Qiaqing readily agreed to lend us ten thousand yuan temporarily to cover military expenses. Therefore, in one fell swoop, Mr. Xu Guqing immediately went to Beijing, regrouped the old troops, recaptured Tianbao City, and occupied Nanjing. Thus, success was achieved, and the founding of the Republic of China was based on this. Mr. Qiaqing's position in Shanghai's business community and his great contribution to the creation of the Republic of China are probably not known to the general public. I would like to point out two things that are most relevant and worthy of eternal remembrance, which must be reported.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai's Words</p>
<p>Mr. Qiaqing is seventy years old this year, but his spirit is like that of seventeen years old. His life encompasses two major concepts: his career view, enduring hardship, all came from hardship and difficulty, what is called success from sweat and blood. His view of life is that he is dedicated to work during the day and seeks entertainment at night. With a broad mind, his career can develop and serve the country for life without becoming an official, and only seeking career development, regardless of the amount of money. Now, his ships are increasing day by day, like the reproduction of his own children. In short, Mr. Qiaqing is a hero who creates the situation for Shanghai, and also a hero who creates the times (at this point, the entire hall laughed).</p>
<p>Anecdotes of Birthday Gifts</p>
<p>During the Nanyang Industrial Exposition in the second year of the Xuantong era of the Qing Dynasty, which was initiated by Mr. Qiaqing, the scale was even larger than the West Lake Exposition. At that time, Mr. Qiaqing printed 20,000 commemorative towels. The towels were made of white Hangzhou silk, finely printed using collotype printing (collotype printing was newly invented in the market at that time), depicting a picture with the Regent, Duanfang Bridge, Zhang Renjun, Chen Lanxun, Yang Shiqi, and Qiaqing's six major officials. The preciousness of this commemorative towel is evident. Liu Yumen's wife, Jiao Jun, once possessed one of the above commemorative towels. For this birthday event, she specially framed the towel to serve as a birthday gift and leave a memory. Also, this birthday celebration was solemn and grand. The director of the association, Mao Heyuan, specially presented the birthday star with a sumptuous banquet, inviting Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Jin Tingsun, Chuan Xiaoan, Yang Xiaotian, Yu Zuoting, Zhang Jiguang, and others to accompany him.

<h3 id="e106">Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau to Issue 12 Million Yuan in Public Bonds; Negotiating with Shanghai Banking Group for 10 Million Yuan Mortgage;杭江 Segment Re-railing and Renovation; Xiang-Ping Segment Scheduled for Completion and Opening by June Next Year <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Administration, in order to replace the heavy rails on the Hangzhou-Yushan section, renovate the Xiaoshan-Jingjiang and Xiangtan-Pingxiang sections of the railway, plans to issue 12 million yuan in corporate bonds and is currently in contact with Shanghai banking groups to negotiate a mortgage. The construction of the Xiangtan-Pingxiang section is progressing rapidly and is scheduled to be completed and opened to traffic in June next year. A Xin Xin News Agency reporter investigated and reported the details as follows:</p>
<p>Re-railing of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway: The Hangzhou-Jiangshan section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway previously used 35-pound light rails to expedite traffic and save costs. It could only handle 15-ton vehicles, while 35-ton and 40-ton vehicles could not travel on it. The Yushan-Nanchang section, which has been completed, and the Nanchang-Pingxiang section, which is under construction, both use 63-pound heavy rails that can handle 40-50 ton vehicles. In order to unify the standard, it has been decided to replace the Hangzhou-Jiangshan section with 63-pound heavy rails. The project will cost six to seven million yuan. At the same time, the section from Pingxiang through Liling to Zhuzhou has many steep slopes and bends and needs to be renovated. The Xiaoshan to Jingjiang station route also needs to be rebuilt, with an estimated cost of two million yuan.</p>
<p>Continuing to Issue Public Bonds for Construction Costs: The Board of Directors of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Administration, recognizing that the above projects are essential and require significant funds, resolved through a board meeting to issue 12 million yuan in corporate bonds. Three million yuan will be used to repay accumulated debts, and the remaining seven million yuan will be used for re-railing the Hangzhou-Jiangshan section, realigning the Xiaoshan-Jingjiang section, and renovating the Pingxiang-Zhuzhou section. It is proposed to use the entire railway's revenue as collateral for the corporate bonds and the assets of the Hangzhou-Yushan section as a mortgage for annual principal and interest payments. A Xin Xin News Agency reporter learned from the banking group that Zeng Huopu, Director of the Railway Department and Chairman of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau, had repeatedly contacted them regarding the mortgage of the corporate bonds. The banking group considers the bond guarantee to be no problem, but is currently considering the mortgage because the Hangzhou-Yushan section is subject to the Boxer Indemnity. At the same time, Zeng Huopu is also trying to raise funds in many ways, so it is expected to become a reality soon.</p>
<p>Xiang-Ping Project to be Completed Next Year: After the groundbreaking ceremony for the Xiangtan-Pingxiang section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway on February 16th of this year, all earthwork projects were contracted out and construction began simultaneously in March in three main sections and twelve large sections. Therefore, the project is progressing rapidly, and one-third of the earthwork has been completed. The Nanchang to Zhangshu section will begin laying tracks soon. The entire section of the project is scheduled to be completed in May of next year and opened to traffic in June. By then, the Qiantang River Bridge will also be completed, and the Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces will be connected eastward from Hangzhou to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, and will be connected to the Guangdong-Hankou Railway in Zhuzhou, becoming a major artery of transportation in the Southeast.</p>
<p>Organizing a Bridge Contractor Survey Team: There are more than eighty large and small bridges along the entire line of the Xiangtan-Pingxiang section, including the Gan River Bridge, which is 800 meters long. Its construction is second only to the Qiantang River Bridge, with a construction cost of 1.15 million yuan. Bids have been solicited separately, and the required steel, cement, and other materials have already been transported to Shanghai and will be shipped from Shanghai to the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway. Construction is scheduled to begin on the 15th of this month. Bids have been solicited for other bridges separately. To facilitate surveys by contractors, a survey team has been organized. Any construction company or construction firm of Chinese nationality that is registered as Class A with the Ministry of Industry or the provincial government and has experience in railway bridge construction can participate. Registration must be completed by the 10th of this month at the Engineering Section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau in Hangzhou or the Engineering Office of the Xiangtan-Pingxiang section in Zhangshu. The team will gather in Zhangshu on the 20th of this month and will be led by personnel from the Engineering Office to inspect the locations of various bridges along the line.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Hongxing Hosiery Factory Labor Dispute: Formal Mediation Today; Cause is Factory's Order for Workers to Register and Provide Guarantees <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>According to Guomin News Agency, the Hongxing Hosiery Factory on Caishi Road in the French Concession was initially founded by Ge Hongsheng as a sole proprietorship and has been in operation for seventeen or eighteen years. Ge Shengru was hired as the general manager of the factory. The dog-head brand nylon stockings produced are widely sold. Later, the factory owner Ge Hongsheng passed away, and the factory partnered with Sun Hengfu, who hired Che Zhenchu as the deputy manager of the factory. There are more than 400 male and female workers in the factory, with female workers making up the majority. The treatment of staff and male and female workers has always been very good. Since February of this year, when the former manager Ge Shengru resigned due to old age, Sun hired Li Mingxuan as the general manager. After taking office, Manager Li dismissed Zhou Haiquan, Zhang Hongmao, Xu Binghua, and seventeen other employees, causing all employees to feel threatened. Therefore, in March of this year, with the approval of the Party and government authorities, a knitting industry union was established. The factory stops work every year on June 28th to sort out the accounts and resumes work on July 3rd. This year, on June 27th, the factory issued a notice stating that the internal affairs would be reorganized. All staff should re-verify their guarantee letters, and workers should register and provide guarantees. All male and female workers of the factory unanimously refused to register and provide guarantees. The union also sent representatives to Manager Li to request that work resume on the 3rd as usual, but the factory refused, resulting in a labor dispute. Therefore, the entire workforce went to the Municipal Party Headquarters to petition in heavy rain the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Party and Government Mediation: According to sources from the workers, they braved the rain to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau, demanding that the factory resume work immediately to maintain the livelihoods of the workers. Li Weixiong was sent by the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Zhang Chuqiang was sent by the Social Affairs Bureau to meet with them. The Municipal Party Headquarters advised the factory to resume work first and then mediate according to the law. The factory is still considering it. The Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a meeting between labor and management today for mediation.</p>
<p>Registration Guarantee: The key to this labor dispute is that the factory requires workers to register and provide guarantees, while the workers refuse to do so. Therefore, the factory is threatening to suspend work. The factory's registration form and guarantee letter are recorded as follows: "Hongxing Weaving Factory Worker Registration Form": The undersigned worker ××× hereby agrees to work at the Hongxing Weaving Factory and agrees to abide by the rules, obey commands, and the following conditions. In addition to finding a guarantor and filling out a guarantee letter, this registration is made for record. The registrant is willing to obey commands and abide by the rules. If there is any violation, he is willing to accept severe punishment. The registrant is willing not to work if he is unable to work, or to be idle, or to make unreasonable demands. If there is any violation, he will voluntarily resign. (Signature/Seal) ×××, on ××th day of ××th month of ××th year of the Republic of China, Gender: ×, Age: ××, Native Place: ××, Address: ××. "Hongxing Weaving Factory Worker Guarantee Letter": The undersigned guarantor ×××, courtesy name ××, age ××, from ××, hereby guarantees that the worker ×××, courtesy name ×××, age ×××, is working in your factory. After this guarantee, if the guaranteed person violates any regulations or engages in any improper actions that cause property loss to your factory, the guarantor is willing to waive the right to prior recourse and will be fully responsible for compensation and will not shirk responsibility and is willing to abide by the following conditions: After the guarantee, even if the guaranteed person's position is changed, the guarantor's responsibility remains the same as before the change. Regardless of the reason for the guaranteed person's resignation, if your factory believes that the guarantee responsibility has not ended, this guarantee letter may be retained and not returned. If the undersigned wishes to withdraw the guarantee in the future, a written statement shall be made to your factory, and the undersigned shall only be released from the guarantee responsibility after your factory permits the return of this guarantee letter. Posting in the newspaper shall not be effective. Any litigation arising from this guarantee letter shall be under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Second Special District Court. To Hongxing Weaving Factory, dated ××th day of ××th month of ××th year of the Republic of China, Guarantor: ××××, Occupation: ××, Address: ".</p>
<p>Factory Notice: Hongxing Weaving Factory Notice No. 13: This notice concerns the reorganization of internal affairs in the factory. All staff are required to re-verify their guarantee letters, and workers are required to re-register and provide guarantees. A notice was issued on the 1st of this month.

<p>Yu Qingsong and Chen Zunyi, the representatives sent by our country to Hokkaido, Japan, to observe the solar eclipse of June 19, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Mr. Yu told a Central News Agency reporter that after leaving Shanghai on the 5th of last month, they arrived at Zhixing Village, the observation site, on the 11th. The villagers and students of the village welcomed them warmly. Upon arriving at the village, they immediately assembled the instruments and worked hard to calibrate the position of the instruments, etc. Although the weather was clear on the day of the solar eclipse, one of the four coronal photos taken failed due to clouds. In addition, three sets of movies were also taken. Except for one set of color movies that was sent to the United States for development, the rest have been developed and will be publicly shown to promote and publicize the event. There were a total of 38 teams, 170 people, observing the solar eclipse in Japan, divided into 23 locations. The observation teams from various countries included China, Britain, the United States, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and India. The Chinese team had a total of six members. In addition to Yu and Chen, there were also Wei Xueren, Zou Yixin, Shen Bingxian, and Feng Jian. Yu and others were late in arriving in Shanghai until today because the Imperial Academy of Japan and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science formally invited members of the observation teams from various countries on the 2nd of this month. During this period, they visited various observatories to inspect their facilities. They now plan to report everything to President Cai Yuanpei and will return to Nanjing tomorrow. The Japanese government specially increased the budget by hundreds of thousands of yuan for this solar eclipse observation. Astronomers, physicists, and meteorologists from all over the country, regardless of age, were all mobilized. People all over the country, regardless of gender or age, knew the term "corona." The national press all published special editions and extras. The impression gained by Yu and the others on this trip was very good, and they gained a lot of experience. They now plan to return to Nanjing and work hard to prepare for the investigation of the location, transportation, and weather conditions of the total solar eclipse that will be visible in China on September 21, 1941. The results of this trip will be reported in detail by the Chinese Solar Eclipse Observation Committee or the Chinese Astronomical Society.</p>

<p>The National Goods Movement Federation of Shanghai hosted members of the press, academic circles, and the national goods industry yesterday, establishing a student summer vacation national goods promotion group. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: Yesterday afternoon, the Federation hosted members of the press, academic circles, and the national goods industry on the ninth floor of the YMCA at the Baixianqiao. Principals from Guanghua, Jiaotong, Shanghai Girls' High School, Guohua, Provincial Shanghai High School, Huamin, Qixin, McLane, Xinhuan, Nanli, and other large and small schools, as well as representatives from the National Goods Maintenance Association, the National Goods Factory Federation, the Machinery Industry Federation, the Citizen National Goods Annual Meeting, the National Product Manufacturers Association, and other groups, as well as reporters from various newspapers, Ren Jinping, Shao Daren, Xu Jianruo, Wang Xingyi, Zheng Tonghe, and others, totaling more than eighty people. Hu Xiyuan, Huang Renzhi, Zhu Wenqi, Zhang Huikang, and Wang Xingyao served as the presidium.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: Chairman Hu Xiyuan said in his speech: "Distinguished guests, since the establishment of our association this spring, we have been deeply grateful for your assistance in carrying out our work. Currently, our association plans to take advantage of the summer vacation of various schools to invite students from various schools to promote the use of national goods to all sectors of society in order to revitalize the industry, etc." Huang Renzhi decided to give a speech, saying, "The educational circles are all intellectuals, and they are very active in promoting and protecting national goods. Although the schools have already started their vacations, we hope that we can fully prepare during this vacation and implement it when the next semester starts, cooperate with each other to save the crisis. I am willing to follow you all and be a small soldier in promoting national goods."</p>
<p>Reporting the Process: Wang Xingyao of the Domestic Group then reported on the preparations for organizing the Women's National Goods Use Group and the Yangtze River Inspection Group, and also sent letters to local governments to lead and organize national sports meetings. Zhang Huikang of the Foreign Group then reported on the situation of the Nanyang Inspection Group and also sent letters to Nanyang overseas Chinese merchants to promote national goods and asked the government to refund the export raw material tax. Zhu Wenqi said in his speech that to promote national goods, we should first enable the public to have the ability to distinguish between national goods and smuggled goods. The press should cooperate with industry and commerce to carry out publicity and introduction to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Pan Yangyao reported on the meaning and method of organization (the original text has been seen in previous reports, omitted).</p>
<p>Speech Notes: After the report, Zheng Xigu then replied, "We very much agree with your association's proposal. Smuggling is rampant everywhere today, and promoting national goods is the best way to prevent smuggling, etc." Wang Jie'an said in his speech, "Our country's industry and commerce are backward and are subject to the dumping of foreign goods, which has led to a gradual decline. Promoting national goods is not only for the sake of the industrial and commercial circles, but also an important plan to save the industry." Wang Xingyi said in his speech, "The press and academic circles can all be models for society. Our country's fledgling industry and commerce rely entirely on promotion and publicity to develop, etc." Zhu Youquan said in his speech, "Recently, the New Life Promotion Group went to the interior to promote. We hope that your association can cooperate with them. All universities will host literacy schools during the summer vacation based on the special education plan. We hope that industrial and commercial circles can provide materials for publicity. At the same time, the academic circles also hope to be close to society and enter factories to practice and help each other."</p>

<p>The Central Breeding Farm of the Ministry of Industry, in view of the backwardness of China's animal husbandry, urgently needs to improve it. Therefore, in recent years, it has been engaged in breeding improvement and promotion throughout the country to improve the local inferior livestock breeds in order to increase farmers' production. Recently, it has reached an agreement with the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction to jointly promote the Feng County, etc., livestock extension area, which has been established one after another. Because Feng County's sheep are mainly used for meat, and the output is weak, the farm specially selected fifty Spanish Merino (wool breed) sheep to breed a dual-purpose breed and built sheep sheds and sent technicians Pan Guosong and Gao Depei to transport them, and appointed Gao Depei as the Feng County Livestock Instructor. The farm is now carrying out livestock promotion in Dou Mountain and Shanghai counties.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Zhang Xueliang Leads Troops to Eradicate Bandits in Northwest China; All Reports in Japanese Newspapers are Rumors <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter interviewed a certain member of the Central Committee who had recently returned from an inspection in the Northwest. According to him, the troops led by Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang are working extremely hard to eradicate bandits in the Northwest. The bandit stronghold of Wayaobao has been captured by the Northwest Army. The director's report disclosed in various newspapers the other day recently provided detailed information on the progress of bandit eradication. On June 30, various Japanese newspapers in Shanghai published reports saying that the Northeast Army held a meeting of generals in Xi'an and passed resolutions to secede from the central government, ally with Russia and accommodate the Communists, and organize an independent government. This is completely rumor-mongering. The generals of the Northeast Army are currently working hard to eradicate bandits at the front and there is no such meeting. Deputy Commander Zhang follows the orders of the central government in everything. The facts of the bandit eradication that have occurred recently prove that this rumor can be disproven without attacking it.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Cost Losses and Sluggish Sales; Yarn Factories Reduce Shifts to Maintain Operations; Night Shifts Suspended, Day Shifts Reduced; Northern China Yarn Industry in Dire Condition; Ministry Requested for Relief <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the Chinese yarn factories in Shanghai are suffering from the dumping of products from Japanese yarn factories and the impact of expensive cotton and cheap yarn, resulting in sluggish sales and cost losses. For example, the cost of producing one package of yarn, including the cost of cotton and labor, is seven or eight jiao more than the market price, and each piece loses 30 yuan. In addition, Japanese yarn is being dumped at lower prices, resulting in sluggish sales of Chinese yarn. It is difficult for the factories to maintain operations under these difficult conditions. They are now suspending night shifts first and reducing working hours for day shifts to avoid accumulating goods and maintain operations. As for the yarn industry in North China, since the Chinese yarn factories in Tianjin, Yuda, Yuyuan, Beiyang, etc., were acquired by Japanese merchants, they are now operating on a large scale, preparing to add 300,000 yarn spindles, and have established contact with Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai and Qingdao. Therefore, the situation of the yarn industry in North China has become like overturning a bird's nest. The factories are now requesting relief from the Ministry of Industry and are sending representatives to Shanghai to report on the situation of the yarn industry in North China to the National Chinese Yarn Factory Federation and discuss rescue measures.</p>

<p>Families Weep by the River</p>
<p>Listeners Saddened</p>
<p>At around 6 AM yesterday morning, a rowboat numbered 822 in the Yangjing Port of Pudong, carrying eleven passengers, men and women, was being rowed across the river by rower Wang Shaokun. When it reached Puxin, a small steamer suddenly sailed downstream. At that time, raging waves surged, and Wang's boat was overloaded, unable to withstand the impact, and suddenly overturned. All eleven passengers, who were all small vegetable vendors, and the rower fell into the river. The vegetable baskets that they were carrying were also completely lost. The No. 4 ferry from the nearby Xidukou went to rescue them, and the rower Wang Shaokun, and the passengers Yang Kouquan, Yu Minshi, Qian Shenshi, and Qian Chenshi, and other five people were rescued on the spot. Six other women passengers were drowned, and their bodies sank and their whereabouts are unknown. The Customs Water Police brought the rower who caused the accident, together with the rowboat, to the police station for investigation. Five of the six women who died have been identified as being from Pudong: Yin Zhangshi, 47 years old; Yin Xinbao, 17 years old; Zhang Yinshi, 42 years old; Xu Shenshi, 52 years old; Xu Genying, 32 years old, Xu Shenshi's daughter. There is one other woman whose name, age, and place of origin are unknown as no family members have reported it. Afterwards, the majority of the deceased's family members went to the riverside to cry, and the spectators were saddened.</p>

<p>Many Treated for Rabies; One Person Dies in Isolation Hospital</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of rabies in dogs and pigs in this city, it has remained severe. In May, a total of 132 people who had dog rabies sought diagnosis, cauterization, and treatment at the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department's Medical Laboratory. Of these, 21 were from other cities, and 111 were from Shanghai. At the same time, there was also a patient with dog rabies in the Isolation Hospital of the Shanghai Municipal Council, who died due to ineffective treatment.</p>

<p>Electrocuted and Fainted While Getting a Perm; Gradually Awakened After Being Sent to the Hospital</p>
<p>Xu Zhixue, a 19-year-old woman from Guangdong, lived at No. 85 Youheng Road, Hongkou. Yesterday afternoon, as it was a weekly holiday from school, Xu went to the Continental Barber Shop under the Continental Department Store on Shandong Road with four or five female companions to get a haircut. Xu asked the barber to give her a perm. It turned out that the barber shop's equipment was not good, the skills were poor, and the use of the equipment was completely unknown. Before Xu had been getting a perm for long, she was electrocuted and fainted on the chair. Seeing that he had caused a disaster, the barber quickly pulled the power switch to avoid a fire, but Xu was already barely breathing. Her companions reported to the police, who dispatched a car to rush her to the hospital for treatment. After the doctor injected her with stimulants, she gradually regained consciousness and is still being treated. The police will investigate the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Gun Theft Case at the District Court: Criminal's Confession is Cunning and Evasive <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Unable to Trace Accomplices; Local Prosecution to Proceed First</p>
<p>On the night of May 9, the Shanghai District Court's exhibit warehouse was burglarized, and 20 new-style pistols were stolen. The Yulin Road Police Station subsequently arrested the criminals Wang Xiao'a'yu and the female criminal Wang Shishi, seized 12 stolen guns, and handed them over to the Public Security Bureau, who transferred them to the District Court for detention and investigation. It has been a long time, and there has not been a rigorous interrogation at the Public Security Bureau and the police station, which led to the criminals remaining uncooperative. After being sent to the court, the criminals evaded the issue in a very cunning manner, claiming that only they had entered to steal the guns, and that there were no accomplices. The court thinks that this matter is very important and it cannot be as simple as that, and the criminals are very experienced in this way, which is enough to see it clearly. However, in order to thoroughly understand and eliminate evil, the Criminal Police Division was ordered to try all kinds of methods, but the criminals still did not reveal any flaws, and no one has visited the criminals in the detention center, which made the investigation of the remaining criminals very difficult. Therefore, in addition to investigating elsewhere, the court will proceed with a partial prosecution of the criminals first.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Police Officer Deeply Addicted to Opium <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Opium Found in Pocket, Already Sent to Headquarters for Investigation</p>
<p>Yang Wanchun, a police officer from the Yongxing Road Police Station in Zhabei, is 37 years old and from Shandong Province. Recently, he was ordered by headquarters to go to the police training center for training. A few days ago, Deputy Captain Zhou of the training team noticed that Yang looked sallow and haggard, listless, and suspected that he was addicted to opium. Therefore, during a drill, he ordered Yang to step out of the line and searched him. Unexpectedly, five small packets of opium were found in his pocket. He was immediately taken back to the Yongxing Road Police Station. After a brief interrogation, a report was prepared and submitted to headquarters for investigation. It is also reported that headquarters will strictly deal with this case in accordance with the regulations on smoking and guarantee bonds for police personnel.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Ningbo Native Association Petitions for the Cancellation of the Qing County Cemetery Registration Regulations <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Ningbo Native Association submitted a document to the Civil Affairs Department of Zhejiang Province yesterday, which reads: "Respectfully, our association previously petitioned for a legal correction regarding the hasty demolition of graves by the Yin County government, and requested that the cemetery registration regulations implemented in various towns and villages of Yin County be fundamentally cancelled to prevent future troubles. We also proposed a comprehensive plan for reorganizing cemeteries, adopting local public cemeteries, and implementing it in stages. We received Jun Qing's telegraphic reply No. 360 on May 22, acknowledging receipt of the memorial submitted on May 9. After investigation, in the urban and rural areas of Yin County, in addition to the temporary coffins that should continue to be ordered to be buried, all actual graves not located within specific land utilization zones will be registered and exempted from relocation. The 'Yin County Cemetery Registration Regulations for Various Towns and Villages' (hereinafter referred to as 'the Regulations'), which the county presented to the department for record in January of the 21st year, do not conflict with the current regulations and do not need to be cancelled. In addition to copying the submitted memorial, the Yin County government is ordered to investigate and pay attention to whether cancellation is necessary, based on whether it conflicts with current regulations. If there is a conflict, it should not be allowed to exist, and the petition for cancellation is approved, demonstrating the department's utmost intention to uphold the rule of law. Therefore, our association is submitting to the department a separate explanation of the points where the Regulations absolutely conflict with the current regulations (including all laws and regulations). It is a fact that humans cannot be born without dying. Before birth, they are called fetuses; after death, they are called corpses. Current laws treat corpses and fetuses equally, adopting an active protection policy. Cemeteries are where corpses are buried, so they are also under protection (Articles 246 to 250 of the Criminal Law). However, because it protects corpses, it also protects cemeteries. Therefore, it is not necessary to involve the corpse's remains, bones, hair, or burial items (coffins are a type of burial item); even simple insults or excavations are considered crimes. These are all clearly stipulated by law. Now that the Regulations are called 'Cemetery Registration Regulations,' the ultimate purpose should be registration and should not involve matters outside of registration, which is very clear. However, Article 3 stipulates a registration fee of 20 cents per grave, and Article 4 stipulates that graves not registered within one year will be treated as ownerless and relocated to public cemeteries. This transforms the cemetery registration regulations into cemetery demolition regulations. Implementing cemetery demolition regulations through a county order is already inappropriate. Furthermore, using the payment or non-payment of a 20-cent registration fee as the standard for whether to demolish a grave conflicts with the current policy of protecting cemeteries. This is one point. Article 1 of the Regulations states, 'All cemeteries in various townships of this county must be registered with the local township office within one year of the promulgation of these Regulations,' etc. The Regulations were promulgated in January of the 21st year, and one year from then is the 22nd year. During this period, if not registered, they must be relocated to the public cemetery according to Article 4. However, the department's telegraphic reply states that all actual graves will be registered and exempted from relocation. It is unclear whether 'all actual graves will be registered and exempted from relocation' refers to those already registered before February of the 22nd year, or whether the deadline is extended by one year for new registration. Our association is deeply concerned. If it is the former, those not registered will still not be exempted from relocation to the public cemetery. If it is the latter, until which year and month will the deadline be extended? After the deadline, will the policy of relocating ownerless graves to the public cemetery according to Article 4 still be followed? If the policy of relocating ownerless graves to the public cemetery according to Article 4 is still followed, it will conflict with the telegraphic reply stating that actual graves will be registered and exempted from relocation. This is another point. After investigating judicial precedents regarding crimes related to graves, excavating a grave with an owner determines the number of crimes based on the owner; for ownerless graves, the number of crimes is determined by the act. Initially, the crime and punishment did not differ based on whether it had an owner or not. The Ministry of Interior's Public Cemetery Regulations of the 17th year also did not explicitly mention the removal of ownerless graves. Although Article 14 of the Provincial Public Cemetery Regulations of the same year (Public cemeteries will be registered every two years. If not registered for five consecutive times, the administrator or operator should notify the grave owner. If still not registered within two years, it will be considered ownerless. The corpses in the aforementioned ownerless graves should be reburied in a public burial area within the public cemetery and marked.) contains provisions for ownerless graves, it also states that relocation cannot be carried out until twelve years of non-registration have passed. Now, the Regulations only stipulate one year as the limit. Calculating by year, the deadline is shortened by eleven years; calculating by month, the deadline is shortened by 132 months; calculating by day, the deadline is shortened by 4,015 days, not only conflicting with judicial precedents but also with the public cemetery regulations. This is a third point. Article 5 of the Regulations states, 'After cemetery registration, the township office will issue a registration certificate. The owner of each grave should mark the registration number on the upper left corner of the front of the grave for identification,' etc., which is another important cause of this cemetery dispute. Whether or not a cemetery is registered, the grave owner naturally uses the registration certificate as the basis. If the basis is whether there is a number on the corner of the grave, there are no explicit regulations on how the code number on the corner of the grave should be kept or who should keep it. Even if the grave owner has the obligation to keep it, it is questionable whether it can be permanently maintained after rain, snow, wind, and frost. Once demolished, the physical evidence is destroyed, and there is no way to prove whether the number existed. As a result, not registering will certainly lead to demolition, and even those who have registered and hold a registration certificate will be demolished without recourse. What is the use of issuing a registration certificate? What is the effect of the registration certificate? Furthermore, what is the meaning of Article 7, which states that the registration form uses a three-part form? Even if questioned, the county would probably have to admit that it is self-contradictory. This is a fourth point. In summary, the 'Yin County Cemetery Registration Regulations for Various Towns and Villages' promulgated in the 20th year still need to be cancelled. We dare to continue our previous request, respectfully asking the department to approve the cancellation of these regulations and formulate a comprehensive plan for reorganizing cemeteries to urge implementation, in order to promote the rule of law. We are anxiously awaiting your instructions. Respectfully presented to Xu, the Director of the Zhejiang Civil Affairs Department."</p>
<h3 id="e123">A Record of Liu Haisu's Art Exhibition <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Over Eight Thousand Visitors in the Past Two Days, More Than Seventeen Works Sold in Three Days</p>
<p>Although yesterday was Sunday, the solo exhibition of artist Liu Haisu was extremely crowded, with visitors coming from Hangzhou, Nanjing, and other places. From morning till night, over three thousand seven hundred people purchased tickets to enter, and many others used invitation tickets. Many continued to visit four or five times, such as Wen Yuanning, the editor of *Tianxia* magazine; lawyer Chen Tingrui; the German Consul-General, Kriebai; the German painter, Luxon; and the British Commercial Counselor, Anna. They visited repeatedly, lingering and admiring, with the feeling of "loving it so much that they couldn't bear to leave." They all said that Liu "conquered nature with his great character, and what he shows in his heart is a mountain range, waves, the sea, waterfalls, old pines, withered forests, and giant rocks. If it is a bird, it is a white phoenix, or a roc, 'whose wings are like clouds hanging from the sky, bearing the blue sky on its back, and nothing can stop it.' If it is a beast, it is a tiger, a cow, a huge creature. This is entirely borrowing these forms to express the concept in his heart, especially the concept of 'greatness,' which is active everywhere in Liu's work." Yesterday alone, eight of Liu's works were sold: No. 8, "White Ape," and No. 99, "Flower," were purchased by Gu Kemin for four hundred gold; No. 93, "Withered Lotus Fighting Autumn Wind," was purchased by Mrs. Huang for three hundred and fifty yuan; No. 69, "Plum and Bamboo in Clear Reflection," was purchased by Ma Bingxun; No. 34, "Yellow Mountain Lotus Peak," was purchased by Cao Keyou; No. 43, "Lotus Pond Scales," was purchased by Sun Shouzhen; and No. 84, "Gourd," was purchased by Zong Boxuan for his collection.</p>

<p>Rescuing Two Kidnapped Girls</p>
<p>On the 2nd of this month, at around 10 AM, just as the Japanese postal company's Hokuyo line ship "Dalian Maru" was about to set sail from the Huangpu Wharf in Hongkou, customs officers discovered a kidnapping case. They immediately reported it to the water police station, which dispatched detective Hu Changqing to board the ship for investigation. He found two young girls, dressed in old, worn-out short shirts and pants, but with fashionable qipao (cheongsam) worn over them, which seemed highly suspicious. An old woman stood beside the two girls, claiming to be their mother, but their surnames were different. After questioning, it was confirmed that they were being kidnapped. The detective then arrested the male kidnapper, Miao Shougen, on the wharf. At that moment, a Japanese police officer arrived and questioned them in detail. Finally, they took the group back to the water police station. According to one girl, named Wang Xiaoshu, 16 years old, she lived in the straw hut in Jiaotong Road, Zhabei, in her unmarried fiancé's home, where her fiancé's grandfather had died and the aunt was living there. The other girl, named Hong Jinmei, 18 years old, from Yancheng, was also raised as a child bride in her fiancé's grandfather and grandmother's home at No. 4, Xibaoxing Lane, Zhongxing Road, Zhabei. Both girls said that they used to work at the Ping An No. 6 Yarn Factory. Recently, they were lured to a hotel by two acquaintances, Li San and Xiao Erzi, and raped. Then, they were led to the home of Miao Shougen's mother, Miao Lao, at No. 797, Qiujiang Road, Baoshan Road. Their attire and titles, all of which were taught by those people, and so on. According to the old woman, surnamed Li Wan, 43 years old, from Yangzhou, the kidnapping plan was orchestrated by Miao Lao Si. Because Miao's daughter, named Lao Jiu, runs a brothel in Liaoning, she was taking the two girls to Lao Jiu to work as prostitutes. She only took care of them along the way, and so on. According to Miao Shougen, 19 years old, from Yancheng, the mastermind behind this kidnapping of the two girls was Zhang Jiting, who is on the run, and so on. The police chief found that Miao Lao Si, Zhang Jiting, and others specialized in kidnapping, and the number of victims was unknown. Therefore, he ordered to keep it secret for the time being and ordered a strict search, but they had already escaped upon hearing the news and could not be arrested. So, yesterday, he notified investigators Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang from the Women and Children Relief Association, who, together with the original detective, took the four people to the local court. The prosecutor Xie conducted a preliminary hearing and ordered the male and female criminals to be detained. The two kidnapped girls will be released to their families to be claimed.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Scuffle Between Rickshaw Gang and Fruit Gang at Xinza Bridge <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Resulting in Injuries on Both Sides</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at about 10 o'clock, a scuffle suddenly broke out between the rickshaw gang and the fruit gang at Xinza Bridge South. Each side gathered dozens of people. The weapons used by the rickshaw gang were wooden sticks used on the rickshaws, while the fruit gang occasionally used fruit knives. Without asking why, they attacked each other indiscriminately. At that time, many members of the fruit gang were injured by the sticks. A rickshaw puller was chased by a thug from the fruit gang to the entrance of the Fang Shed at No. 13, Dianli Company, Xinza Bridge Road, and stabbed to the ground. He was stabbed four or five times in the chest, abdomen, legs, and other places, and blood flowed continuously. He lay in a pool of blood next to the electric pole. Fortunately, the street patrol officer heard the alarm and arrived, blowing the whistle wildly and reporting the situation to the Xinza police station via telephone. A large number of Chinese and foreign detectives rushed to the scene, and the thugs dispersed in a panic. The ambulance sent the stabbed rickshaw puller, who had collapsed on the ground, to Baolong Hospital for treatment. It is said that he lost too much blood and was seriously injured, so there is a danger of death. As for the cause of the scuffle, it was because a fruit vendor, A, saw the rickshaw pullers loading beans at the Zhabei Rice Wharf. At first, they quarreled over trivial matters, and then they resorted to violence. Neither side was willing to back down, and soon they gathered their colleagues and the above-mentioned martial arts drama broke out. It was also heard that after the patrol officers arrived to investigate, they arrested a person nicknamed "Little Suzhou A Xiang" from the fruit gang. However, A Xiang also suffered serious injuries from wooden sticks.</p>

<p>Husband and Wives Repeatedly Sue Each Other</p>
<p>Xu Bozhang, a native of Fuzhou, in his forties, is a businessman in Shanghai. In September of the 23rd year (likely of the Republic), he cohabited with Pan Jingyu, a 22-year-old woman from Changzhou, at No. 50, Fengyu Lane, Route Saossey, French Concession. In October of last year, they had a daughter. At the beginning of this summer, Xu's wife, Wang Aiyu, came to Shanghai from her original home in Fuzhou and stayed with Xu at No. 22, Dacheng Apartment, Putiebang Pubo Road. Later, Xu did not return home for a long time. Pan Jingyu mistakenly thought that Xu had another new love outside and abandoned her, so she reported to the French police. When the police sent detectives to arrest Xu and Wang Aiyu, they learned that Xu and Wang were legally married and did not prosecute them. Later, Pan filed another complaint with the police, accusing Xu Bozhang of bigamy. Xu was arrested and sent to the court. It was found that the statute of limitations had expired and he was not convicted. Now, Wang Aiyu has hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Special Second Court, accusing Pan Jingyu of obstructing freedom and false accusation, and attaching a civil suit, requesting a judgment ordering compensation for damages to reputation and other losses of 1,000 yuan. After Judge Li Changnian opened a court hearing and summoned the defendant, the defendant also hired a lawyer, Pan Zhensheng, to defend.

<p>Lu Ma, an Anhui woman, 57 years old, lived at No. 753, Fangbang Road, in the city and made a living by washing clothes for others. Two months ago, she returned to her hometown. At that time, her neighbor Li Yunting had a daughter named Er Guniang, who was just a young girl. Because of poverty, she could not support herself, so she entrusted Lu to bring her to Shanghai to find someone to marry. Then, on March 2nd, she brought Er Guniang to Shanghai and lived at Lu's place. Li Songshou (22 years old), a fellow villager who was a machine worker, heard about the matter. Lu saw that Li was young and docile, so she agreed to the marriage and betrothed Li's daughter to him. They agreed on a bride price of 140 yuan. At that time, Li agreed without hesitation and promised to pay it later. He then made an excuse that there was no one to take care of her at home and took Er Guniang to live at No. 5, Qinxian Lane, Junying. But after Li's daughter went to her husband's home, she was raped by her fiancé for a month. Now, Lu accused Li of failing to fulfill the marriage contract and failing to pay the bride price. She had repeatedly spoken to him, but he always prevaricated. Yesterday afternoon at 6:05, Lu went to Li's place again to argue, but to no avail. Because he was actually engaged in fraudulent marriage, she grabbed him and reported it to the police. Then, they were taken to the Dongjiadu Police Station for questioning. According to Li Songshou, he admitted to raping his fiancée, but he could not afford the bride price because of financial difficulties, and so on. The station chief, because the case involved fraudulent marriage and seduction of a young girl, has now reported it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Wen Xiushan, a native of Funing, who lived at No. 31, Wuzhou Road, married Wu Xiaolong (21 years old), a woman from Yangzhou, Shenjiatan, Yangshupu, as his second wife after his first wife passed away. Wu was frivolous, and at first they lived in peace after she married into the family. Later, she often went out to play, causing Wen to quarrel with her from time to time. Their relationship became increasingly cold. In May of this year, Wu once secretly returned home and sent a letter to Wen through a lawyer surnamed Ma, intending to divorce. As a result, her mother sent her back and advised her to settle the matter. Unexpectedly, Wu recently became acquainted with Wang Debao, a native of Jiangbei, and went to a small inn in Hanqiao, Zhabei, secretly. On the evening of the 9th of last month at 8 o'clock, she took the opportunity to go to the inn and never returned. After Wen found out about this matter, he learned that the neighbor and fellow villager, Xiao Jinbao, a cobbler, had introduced them. So, he reported it to the Jiaxing Road Police Station, which sent detectives to arrest him. He was questioned and learned that Wang Debao's mother, Ni, had helped her son to do such a disgraceful thing beforehand. The detectives went to No. 21, Yangshupu Road, and arrested her as well, and escorted her to the Special First Court. Ni firmly denied that her son and Wu had eloped to Ningbo and claimed that she knew nothing about it, and that her son had already married a wife. She also hired a lawyer to defend her, claiming that Wu was not Wen's legal wife, but a concubine. The court ordered a postponement and summoned the woman's parents to testify. Yesterday, Xiao Fen, a judge, continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. According to the woman's mother, Wu Liu, her father, Wu Zhenxing, and the matchmaker, Wang Xiaolin, she was indeed the second wife, and the bride price, including jewelry, was 250 yuan. However, there were contradictions in their testimonies. Judge Xiao questioned the two defendants in detail and sentenced Xiao Jinbao to one year of imprisonment. Wang Ni was acquitted and released.</p>

<p>Tan Yun: One Hundred Pieces of Calligraphy: Tan Yun has been doing business in Shanghai for more than ten years. During his spare time, he always enjoys writing calligraphy. The various styles of calligraphy he writes, whether it is meticulous small regular script or large characters, have their own unique charm. He wields the brush with his left wrist, and his strokes are particularly strong. Previously, Wang Tiechan, an overseas Chinese from Nanyang, commissioned Tan to write a large hanging scroll. The brushstrokes were vigorous and ancient, deeply capturing the essence of Wei stele calligraphy. When Mr. Wang took the scroll abroad and returned to Nanyang, the local overseas Chinese praised it as "Tan's Wei Stele," and everyone was eager to see it first. Recently, Mr. Tan, considering that the hot summer is approaching and there is an endless stream of people requesting calligraphy on fans, has decided to set a limit. Starting from July 1, the fee for each piece is two yuan, with a limit of one hundred pieces. The fee for scrolls is five yuan each, regardless of size, and the fee for large hanging scrolls is doubled. Inferior paper will not be used. The pieces can be collected in five days. The collection address is Tan Guosheng, 2nd Floor, No. 403 Zhejiang Road, British Concession, Shanghai.</p>

<p>Zhenru Initial School, jointly run by the Shanghai Education Bureau and National Jinan University, has a history of many years and focuses on experimental production education. However, due to the constraints of past personnel environment and material conditions, it has not been able to fully develop, and even experienced repeated disturbances and endless troubles. Therefore, at the end of the last academic year, the City Education Bureau proposed to stop the co-operation. However, at that time, Jinan University happened to change its president, and He Bingsong succeeded the President of Jinan University, so the previous proposal was shelved. Recently, due to the dilapidated school building facilities, it is not easy to seek rapid progress, and the city treasury is in short supply. Therefore, from the 25th year, the previous proposal was reiterated and the co-operation with Jinan University will no longer be carried out, but will be hosted by Jinan University alone.

<p>17. The judging committee must be composed of the chief judge and judges. In addition, two clerks must be assigned.</p>
<p>18. In the World Games and European Championships, each final competition must be assigned seven judges approved by the International Amateur Swimming Association. For other formal international competitions, five judges are sufficient.</p>
<p>19. The chief judge must manage the competition and supervise the implementation of the rules.</p>
<p>20. The competition records must be kept by two clerks.</p>
<p>21. The judges must be directed by the chief judge in different positions. If it does not interfere with the facts, it is best to be on both sides of the diving board.</p>
<p>22. After each dive, the judges must immediately report their individual scores clearly at the same time upon hearing the chief judge's signal. No consultation is allowed.</p>
<p>23. The chief judge must record each judge's score on the record sheet one by one in order, and delete the highest and lowest scores, and then hand it over to the first clerk. If two or more scores to be deleted are equal, then none of them may be deleted.</p>
<p>24. The first clerk must fill in the result of multiplying the average value of the remaining scores by the difficulty factor into the actual score column on the sheet.</p>
<p>25. The first clerk must bind the copies of the record sheets for safekeeping.</p>

<p>28. The athlete who obtains the highest total score in the competition is the winner. If two or more athletes obtain the same total score, the athlete with the higher total score in the required dive shall be determined. If the total score in the required dive is still equal, the score of the required dive with the highest difficulty factor shall be determined.</p>
<p>29. The giving of scores must be based on the following table and the judges' opinions, from zero to ten points.</p>

<p>The Second Battle of Medan</p>
<p>(June 13th) The reporter injured his finger in the first battle. Taking advantage of today's match against the weak European All-Stars, I asked for leave to rest. The European team is large in stature, but their football skills are mediocre and their movements are slow. They are not a match for our team. In addition, we have taken into account the audience's dissatisfaction from the previous day and further reformed the lineup, strengthening the strength of the center-back line. Therefore, the game was full of highlights, winning constant praise. A certain English fighter, with a fat body, had already saved many dangerous balls in the previous day's match. Today, he has even more amazing skills. The audience, seeing him as chubby but agile like an ape, all exclaimed and applauded to celebrate him. It is heard that after the game, this gentleman was awarded a silver cup to reward his assistance. This gentleman's contribution was the greatest in preventing the European team from being completely defeated. Our team is evenly matched as a whole. In contrast, they are even more beautiful. Individually, Li Tiansheng in the back defense and Feng Jingxiang in the front forward were the most outstanding. Feng, as the center forward, scored three goals alone, which is very commendable. Unfortunately, he injured his knee in the second half and was forced to leave the field, replaced by Zhuo Shijin. Bei Hua also injured his back in this match and could not run well. After the match, Mrs. Huang, the consul, presented the award in French, and I thanked her in English. Our lineup is on the left. The score was two to zero in the first half and four to zero in the end. The goalscorers were Jingxiang (3) and Jinshun (1). Xu Yahui was the acting captain.</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping, Tan Jiangbai, Li Tiansheng, Chen Zhenhe, Xu Yahui, Liang Rongzhao, Feng Jingxiang, Sun Jinshun, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>The Third Battle of Medan</p>
<p>(June 14th) Although our team relied on superb football skills after yesterday's game to win back praise from all walks of life, injuries to Feng, Ye, and Jia and others greatly damaged our vitality, which was a net loss. Today, the third battle followed closely. The reporter was still unable to play, so the famous players on the team were all in danger. Fortunately, all the friends worked hard and tried their best, and finally defeated the Su Dong All-Stars 2-0 under the shouts of thousands of spectators, which can be regarded as one of the best works. After careful deliberation, the following eleven players were selected to take the field. The score was two to zero in the first half and two to zero in the end. The goalscorers were Shijin and Jiangbai, each with one goal. Jinshun was the acting captain. Bao Jiaping, Li Tiansheng, Mai Shaohan, Li Guowei, Liang Rongzhao, Zhang Yuan, Chen Zhenhe, Tan Jiangbai, Sun Jinshun, Zhuo Shijin, Yang Shuiyi</p>
<p>The Su Dong All-Stars are a collection of excellent football players from the east coast of the island of Sumatra. Their strength is stronger than the previous two teams. Therefore, when they came into contact on the field, our team was cautious and did not dare to deal with them rashly. The Su Dong All-Stars were also ambitious, wanting to break through our goal as soon as possible. Since our team arrived in Medan, they have not lost a single city. Their eagerness to capture it can be imagined. Twenty minutes after the start of the game, each side attacked and defended. The ball went back and forth between the two goals, each presenting dangerous signs. At twenty-two minutes, Shijin scored a long shot from twenty-five yards away. In less than five minutes, Jiangbai scored another goal with a copper head. The first half ended there. The two teams fought again. We gradually showed signs of fatigue, and the forward offensive slackened slightly. Fortunately, the defense was tight and the response was proper. Under the enemy's fierce attack, we were still able to maintain our flawless form. In this battle, Tiansheng, Jiaping, Shaohan, Rongzhao, Zhenhe, and others were exceptionally good. The rest of the players also worked extremely hard. Although we cannot have a large number of goals today, our side has not lost a single goal so far. The overseas Chinese fans are all happy. There are also people who are tempted to bet and see if we can guarantee not to lose a single goal in the final battle. It can be regarded as the most confusing and the most bettable of all bets.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Where is China's Cooperative Movement Going? <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Shou Miancheng</p>
<p>Recently, China's cooperative enterprises have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain, blooming everywhere; however, in this popular movement, we can see several different directions: some advocate top-down promotion, some advocate bottom-up growth, this is one; some advocate compulsory organization, some advocate voluntary adoption, this is two; some advocate production cooperation as the foundation, some advocate consumer cooperation as the foundation, this is three; some advocate planned control of cooperative enterprises, some advocate free development of cooperative enterprises, this is four. Among these various directions, where should we go becomes a major question. If we cannot determine the path in time, leading to a wrong turn, then the success of China's cooperative movement will be the failure of China's cooperation, which cannot but be taken seriously.</p>
<p>I believe that the decision of all economic policies cannot be separated from three principles: first, it must be able to meet the needs of society at this time and place; construction that does not meet this need is uneconomical construction; second, it must be able to meet the social capacity at this time and place; plans that are beyond capacity are ineffective plans; third, it must be able to recognize the relationships of various aspects of a policy; if one is favored over another, then one of the two between uneconomical and ineffective must be the case.</p>
<p>China's cooperative movement has become an indispensable part of China's economic policy, so it cannot violate the above three principles, naturally no exception. Therefore, Mr. Chen Lifu recently gave a speech at the Cooperative College, saying that China is an agricultural country, and the cooperative organizations produced by capitalist countries must be modified considerably before they can suit China's needs, which is indeed very good. However, we must pay attention that the adaptation of needs and supplies is relative; an organization suitable for China's needs is not necessarily a good organization; at the same time, an organization that is not suitable for China's practical needs is not necessarily a bad organization. First, because the needs themselves have different qualities, if the needs themselves have shortcomings, then adaptation will be unaesthetic. Second, because the feeling of needs has very different degrees. Some needs, which onlookers think certainly exist, may not be felt by the parties involved because of knowledge and habits. Therefore, the so-called needs should refer to objective and rational needs. The explanation of ability is also the same, it must also be determined by dynamic observation, because the size of our ability also varies depending on whether the application is appropriate or not.</p>
<p>Knowing the above three principles, please further analyze the trend that China's cooperative movement should take.</p>
<p>The so-called division of bottom-up and top-down is what some comrades now say is the difference between the cooperative movement and cooperative policy. However, I think it is not very accurate to regard movement and policy as opposing names, because we can have policies to promote the cooperative movement, and we can also have movements to promote cooperative policies. Moreover, the cooperative movement is not necessarily bottom-up. If we look at the development of cooperative enterprises in various countries, although they may not be promoted by the government, there are other top-down forces engaged in promotion, such as the promotion and maintenance of cooperation by farmers' associations and agricultural associations in various countries. Therefore, the real difference here is not the order of top and bottom, but in the subject who knows. Then; our question can also be said to be: should China's cooperative movement still be guided by the government? Or should it be guided by private groups? I have said elsewhere that in these two paths, I advocate being guided by the government. The reasons here need not be explained in detail. However, why have cooperative enterprises in many countries in the past been mostly guided by private groups? I think there are several reasons for this: first, previous governments did not have a full understanding of the meaning and importance of cooperative enterprises; second, some governments, because they were controlled by capitalists, did not dare to openly come out to advocate cooperation; third, private groups did have sufficient power to replace the government in shouldering this mission; fourth, the general public had higher knowledge and stronger organizational skills, so even if they were guided by private groups, it would be easier to take effect; fifth, capitalism has developed considerably, so although some people feel the need for cooperative enterprises, the government inevitably ignores them; sixth, the policies of foreign political parties are relatively clear. Different political parties have different political programs, so cooperative specialization should be guided by private groups to avoid political influence. But turning back to look at China's situation, what is it like? According to our needs, according to our abilities, and according to the observation of all aspects of relations, our cooperative specialization must be guided by the government. However, government guidance and private guidance are not mutually exclusive. If there is a private guidance organization that can assist the government, the government may as well encourage it to fulfill its guiding responsibilities to compensate for what the government cannot do. Moreover, while the government bears the overall guiding responsibility, it must still cultivate the automatic power of the people, so that they can gradually become self-reliant.</p>
<p>Having decided that the government should be responsible for guidance, we again discover two different paths, that is, should alcohol still adopt compulsory organization? Or should it be organized by the people automatically? I think we can at least admit that compulsory organization is a method that can be considered for adoption: first, because cooperative enterprises are the main method of developing the national economy, and the construction of the national economy must seek its development at the highest speed, then if it is not compulsory, it will naturally not be able to achieve its purpose; second, because although cooperation should be voluntary, if the result of cooperation can certainly bring practical benefits to each member, then why not be compulsory? Third, because cooperation is a method, not an end, the purpose of cooperation should be the maintenance and improvement of survival, then as long as the same method can achieve the same purpose, it is fine, as for whether the method of the method is compulsory, it does not matter; fourth, because social inertia is very strong, for many emerging enterprises, people often do not want to proceed automatically due to limitations in habits, so in order to overcome social inertia, compulsory measures are also necessary. However, if the object of our research refers specifically to whether a certain cooperative enterprise in a certain place under the guidance of a certain person can be compulsorily organized, then it is easy to decide whether it is suitable for compulsory measures. Now, if we want to apply this principle to any place, any enterprise, and under the guidance of anyone, then there will be great malpractices and dangers. Therefore, we not only cannot have, but should not have an absolute decision on this issue, we must vary its disposal depending on individual circumstances in order to be reasonable.</p>
<p>Secondly, let me analyze the base problem of cooperative enterprises. That is to say, should China's cooperative movement still take production cooperation as the foundation? Or should it take consumer cooperation as the foundation? Some people may think that this is a question that cannot be established at all, because in fact, almost all past consumer cooperatives in China have failed, and only production cooperatives (including marketing cooperatives) in rural areas have had considerable development, if we still want to advocate consumer cooperation as the foundation now, isn't that going against the trend? However, from the essence of the cooperative system, since production cooperation takes the distribution of profits as its purpose, it cannot be said to be true cooperation. Although the profits of production cooperatives are not distributed according to the amount of shares, which seems to be not entirely the same as the purely capitalist company organization, the products paid by each member are the same nature as the shares, so distributing profits according to products is different in name but the same in reality as distributing profits according to shares, then if production cooperation can be said to be cooperation, the joint purchasing or marketing agencies organized by industrial and commercial operators should also be able to be said to be cooperatives. This is certainly not right. Therefore, the true cooperative movement must start from consumer cooperation. Only a cooperative system that takes consumer cooperation as its foundation can achieve the purpose of eliminating profits, can replace capitalism, and can realize the economic system that is of the Three Principles of the People. I have said before that sometimes, due to the requirements of the environment, the nature of cooperative enterprises can have considerable changes, but the nature of the cooperative system must have its minimum conditions, in other words, the changes in the cooperative system cannot but have its maximum range. If we only talk about methods and forget the purpose, only leave the body and go to the soul, then what kind of cooperative movement is that? Therefore, I think that production cooperation can only seek its development under two conditions: first, the production income of the members who organize the production cooperative must be below the average income of the general public, then even if they enjoy profits, it is only enough to make up for the uneven distribution of wealth; second, consumer cooperatives must also seek their development at the same time, so that production cooperatives can gradually become the production agencies of consumer cooperatives in fact. Only then can it be considered a method that takes both sides into account.</p>
<p>But what if consumer cooperatives have been so unsuccessful in the past? This question is certainly worth our consideration, but we should not think that there is too little we can do; first, because the Chinese government has never given consumer cooperation the same active guidance and promotion as it has given production cooperation; second, because the people who have managed consumer cooperatives in the past have mostly been inappropriate, or although they have the ability but are not serious, or although they want to handle it seriously but have no business experience; third, because the unscientific and rationalization of the general life in our country, although is a major obstacle to promoting consumer cooperation, but we should also improve this lifestyle even if we do not promote consumer cooperation; fourth, because the effectiveness of consumer cooperation sometimes seems to be inversely proportional to the progress of commercial socialization, in other words, the more commercial methods cannot meet the requirements of consumers, the easier it is for consumer cooperation to develop, then since the shops in China are so immature, consumer cooperation should be able to develop.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more question, that is, should the government adopt a planned control method for the development of cooperative enterprises to complete the entire cooperative program, so that it will not grow in a state of anarchy and can improve the efficiency of cooperative organizations? I have spoken elsewhere about the importance of planned control for economic construction. Based on the same standpoint, I certainly hope that cooperative enterprises can also have their plans and control. Therefore, the unification of administrative power, the implementation of general registration, the concentration of marketing, etc., are the minimum facilities that should be available. However, the implementation of planned control can easily lead to great mistakes if there is a slight negligence, so it must be absolutely cautious. The most important thing is to remember at all times that planned control is a method, not an end. The purpose of planned control is to promote the soundness of the cooperative program, improve the efficiency of the cooperative program, and increase the happiness of cooperators. Therefore, if we only seek the realization of the plan and the execution of control, and even see malpractices and still do not know how to improve it, that is the so-called counterproductive, not enough to be a law. As for those who put various obstacles in the way of cooperation in good faith, calling it control in name, but in fact harming it, that is anti-cooperative activity, which is certainly not within the meaning of the control we are talking about.</p>
<p>Based on the above points, we can get a considerable understanding of the path or direction that China's cooperative movement should take. In general, that is: 1. The national cooperative enterprise should be guided actively by the government, and private groups should be in a guiding position; 2. Compulsory organization can be adopted in principle, but it should not be promoted universally; 3. The cooperative movement should take consumer cooperation as the foundation, and production cooperation can only be considered reasonable under certain conditions; 4. The cooperative enterprise should have its entire plan and control, but it should be handled with caution, and it should be based on not harming its purpose.</p>
<h3 id="e189">On the Question of How to Promote Consumer Cooperatives <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Huiwu</p>
<p>The theory that consumer cooperation can solve the livelihood problems of the people is beyond the scope of our discussion. However, we promote consumer cooperation based on this belief. Although this is just the belief of those of us who have a little understanding of cooperation, many poor people endure suffering, endure exploitation by merchants, and live miserable and dark lives, yet they do not know how to save themselves. They lack education, lack ability, lack organization, and because they have been deceived many times, they are suspicious and lack faith. When we tell them, "Organizing a cooperative can save you!" they do not quite understand what cooperation is; even the smarter ones only accept the more sensational aspects of the cooperative system, such as the return of surpluses and fair prices. On the other hand, they suspect us. Those of a worse disposition will immediately scold us as swindlers and liars; those of a better disposition will politely refuse. Even if some curious people are interested and try, they often fail.</p>
<p>Moreover, the salaried class with better occupations has no interest in practicing cooperation due to ordinary commercial transaction habits. Some members who are persuaded or forced to join are merely in name only and are unwilling to "graciously patronize." Even some members who have a strong interest are discouraged because the prices in the cooperative are similar to those in ordinary stores. Although there is a surplus to be distributed, the amount is inevitably small and only available after several months, so they feel bored and are once again attracted by sweet-talking merchants.</p>
<p>Thus, consumer cooperation in our country presents a state of suspended animation, and it is only kept alive by the maintenance of many enthusiastic promoters.</p>
<p>However, consumer cooperation is ultimately the best way to solve livelihood problems. The general public's unwillingness to adopt it, preferring to suffer and not knowing how to save themselves, is truly unbearable for those of us who are watching with some enthusiasm. Therefore, we resolutely advocate using some compulsion in this regard.</p>
<p>Compulsion may seem to contradict the spirit of cooperation at first glance, but under special circumstances, we can regard it as an exception. The best analogy we can use is medical treatment. Some patients need forceful treatment but often refuse the doctor's procedures due to some credulity and fear. However, if they encounter a loyal doctor, they will definitely be forced to do it resolutely, because a loyal doctor, for the sake of the patient's well-being, does not hesitate to cause temporary resentment.</p>
<p>We use some small compulsions to promote cooperation in the same way.</p>
<p>The reason why some people oppose compulsion is because it disregards everything and suddenly changes people's lifestyles according to the selfish intentions of a minority, regardless of whether these people like their new environment or can adapt to it. The revolution advocated by socialists, using riots and confiscation to reform politics and economics, is like this. However, the nature and degree of the compulsion we advocate are different. The compulsion we advocate is only temporary, and the degree is only very slight, so it will not disrupt the order of their past lives. Even if there is some disruption, it will only be to those bad habits. Once these habits are broken, it can lead them to the path of goodness that we recognize.</p>
<p>Regarding this proposition, someone may ask, and we are very happy to answer that it is firmly based on the principle of association.</p>
<p>The evolution of association is closely related to the development of culture. The development of a culture cannot be achieved by the promotion of a few people; it must be accepted by the majority to be considered complete. Association is not culture; it is a relationship in the stage of culture. The two evolve proportionally. As culture progresses, the relationship of association also progresses. Conversely, as culture regresses, the relationship of association also shrinks back. Therefore, as culture gradually progresses, the relationship of association also progresses from being compulsory to semi-compulsory, and now it is said to have gradually entered an era of complete freedom.</p>
<p>However, this three-part process of association is only for our convenience in explanation. There is no concrete stage in the evolutionary process from compulsion to freedom. We start from compulsion and move towards freedom. The more we advance towards freedom, the closer we get to freedom. This is a continuous process, not like a three-step ladder. Therefore, we can say that what we have gone through is a semi-compulsory and semi-free process, or we can say that we have gone through many stages of unequal degrees of compulsion and freedom mixed together. Although the free association is the end point of the journey and the ideal destination, it is a mistake to force the trial of free association if the level of culture is still hesitant in the process of needing some compulsion. This error will bring us an inevitable failure. Because the relationship of association is a result, not a factor that can promote culture. It is useless for us to advocate freedom unless we start from its cause, promoting culture. We can never expect to obtain the desired result, but the promotion of culture, although it can be achieved through our efforts, cannot be accomplished overnight.</p>
<p>Our promotion of cooperation is to promote culture, from which we can obtain the freedom we desire. We use cooperation as a tool of education, correct the errors in our selfish concepts, and train our ability to organize self-governance. In this way, we know how to choose the good automatically, and freedom will come naturally. However, we can never obtain cooperation through freedom. Not only can we not, but some misunderstood freedom is an enemy of cooperation. In the name of freedom, many people have committed illegal acts, because freedom, like other misunderstood names, is easier to define than to understand.</p>
<p>Now let us try to see what our own culture is like. Among us are all Chinese people, so there is no need for any exaggeration—exaggeration itself may give us some pleasure, but it is of no practical benefit at all.</p>
<p>We do not need to trace back to our Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, Confucius and Mencius's rule of tranquility and calmness. It is enough to look in the mirror and see our current situation.</p>
<p>The prevalence of illiteracy, the lack of the spirit of self-governance, the weakness of unity—division will inevitably arise even in a very small group, just like the disc of sand that Premier Sun described, the weakness of character, the strength of selfishness, the disorder of politics, the backwardness of industry, the economic bankruptcy, the increasing foreign insults—all of these are nothing but ugly appearances. Under such cultural conditions, we cannot expect freedom. In our excessive freedom, we have to add some compulsion, although the compulsion we advocate is indeed only a small amount.</p>
<p>Compulsion is not a shame, it is not immoral, it exists in all countries. Professor Gide also praised it in his "Cooperation." Even our cooperation master, Mr. Xue Xianzhou's "Cooperation Program in China" also advocates using the power of the state to implement control.</p>
<p>Therefore, our conclusion is that the only way to save the current economic distress of our people is through cooperation, and to promote cooperation, the government must add some compulsion.</p>
<p>As for the promotion methods, although many aspects should be taken into account, here, we will only focus on the salaried working class in cities and farmers:</p>
<p>Salaried Working Class</p>
<p>Civil servants, institutional staff, and factory workers are the main components of this class. The payment of their salaries must go through the institution. In this way, we can take out a very small amount on their behalf, ready to accumulate as cooperative shares. For example, if we take two yuan as the share amount, then paying five jiao per month for four months will make them a member of a cooperative. This method of deducting salary is often implemented when our country suffers severe disasters, but at that time it was to save people and relieve disasters, and this time it is to save oneself and join a cooperative. We force them to save people, of course, we should also force them to save themselves. Forcing self-help is also a popular fact. For example, the labor insurance system and forced savings are the best examples. Cooperation is more practical than these methods, because these savings and insurance systems do not feel any benefit unless some unfortunate events occur. By joining a cooperative, they can immediately obtain economic and other benefits. Why can't such forced self-help be implemented? — If this method is implemented, various institutions and factories can prepay a sum of funds to enable them to start immediately.</p>
<p>But in this situation, some members, because their participation is forced, often do not want to patronize the transaction unless the cooperative itself has many significant benefits for them — a healthy cooperative store should of course be able to do this — In order to make up for this shortcoming, we have the following method.</p>
<p>This method is for each institution or factory authority to prepay money to open a cooperative store, and then print a special kind of value coupons that are commonly used in this store, and pay them in their salaries to replace part of the cash. The percentage of value coupons should of course be carefully considered, and should be issued less during the trial run. In this way, employees or workers who take these value coupons that cannot be traded with the outside world will only have to trade with cooperative stores. Since the transaction volume of cooperative commodities has a minimum limit, it is not difficult to maintain. As long as it is handled properly and does not make members feel that it is inferior to other ordinary stores, members will not feel any inconvenience in issuing value coupons. On the contrary, their interest will become more and more intense.</p>
<p>Such a method is not an empty ideal. The famous Kangyuan Canning Factory in Shanghai has such a small store, and the workers feel a lot of convenience.</p>
<p>This method also has a benefit, which is to enable members to have a normal consumption for a legitimate purpose, and not to waste all of it on indulgence in gambling and other things.</p>
<p>Rural Areas</p>
<p>It is not suitable to promote distribution cooperation in rural areas, because the villages are scattered and there is no suitable location, and today's farmers in our country have a very narrow range of consumption. What they consume can be said to be only food, which is really a bit pitiful to say.</p>
<p>But their consumption for production cannot be reduced, so we can promote their supply cooperatives.</p>
<p>It is best to promote supply cooperatives in cooperation with credit cooperatives. If we can use the method of supplying goods instead of cash loans in credit cooperatives that can be operated concurrently, the purposes of both credit cooperation and supply cooperation can be achieved, and the principle of credit cooperation engaging in production loans can also be maintained.</p>
<p>If credit cooperatives cannot be operated concurrently, then members can also be forced to organize supply cooperatives after the loan. Because the purpose of credit cooperatives is to promote production, and supply cooperatives are a necessary process to achieve rational production. Some people think that members of credit cooperatives bear unlimited liability and should not form other cooperatives to avoid affecting their responsibilities. In fact, this is a mistake, because individual purchasing and joint cooperative purchasing are both economic activities. If there is any danger, then unless the buying and selling are stopped, it cannot be avoided, and in fact, the former is even more dangerous due to transactions with unreasonable conditions. How can members be allowed to trade individually without allowing cooperative reasonable transactions? Isn't this an unreasonable argument! Therefore, supply cooperation is indeed the most important aspect to promote.</p>
<p>But no matter what kind of consumer cooperation is promoted, the soundness and rationality of the cooperative itself is the greatest key to success. Here, we can only discuss a principle. As for how to manage a rational and sound consumer cooperative, in addition to following the experience and lessons of many pioneers, we also hope that everyone will study and test at any time. Our few people's fantasies are absolutely unreliable.</p>
<h3 id="e190">On the Efficiency of Cooperative Organization <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Junqing</p>
<p>The organization of a cooperative arises to meet a certain need. Therefore, its main businesses include credit, supply, production, marketing, and other categories. However, in the universe, the parties involved often do not feel that there is a certain need, but in fact, the need is very urgent; or they feel the need is urgent, but there is no way to make the means to meet the need quick and satisfactory. These two things seem to be the case in domestic non-cooperative businesses in recent times. Therefore, the organization of cooperatives raises the issue of its efficiency. The so-called efficiency problem of cooperative organization is how to awaken the majority of people to feel their real needs; and how to make the cooperative organization meet their urgent needs in a quick and satisfactory process.</p>
<p>People in our country have put forward various methods for the former question; let's not discuss them here. In my opinion, the name of the solution. First, find a way without violating the central government's laws and regulations on the cooperative industry; otherwise, the name of the cooperative must not be invoked. Here is a brief description of its outline:</p>
<p>Regarding the first question, the following methods can be put forward: The organized cooperatives should carefully find out their effectiveness and find out where their interests lie in detail, and compare them with the individual handling of their economic affairs by the same people in the same area where the cooperatives are not organized, and seek their gains and losses; and then widely disseminate them. This method must first thoroughly rectify the original cooperatives to make their operations profitable.</p>
<p>Hold more or hold regular meetings and lectures at any time. With a sincere and peaceful attitude, a frank and practical content, and a simple and interesting tone, attract people's attention.</p>
<p>Engage in artistic dissemination. Such as dramas, songs, movies, etc., to penetrate into the folk. (Such as Mr. Chen Guofu's "The Beginning of Cooperation" and the China International Famine Relief Commission's "Expanded Social Affairs Week Measures")</p>
<p>Cooperative instructors should learn one or two skills that are generally needed by the people. Such as common medical and health methods, music, arithmetic, calligraphy and painting, art. Anecdotes. Novels, etc., as a means of contact, and then guide them according to the situation.</p>
<p>Regarding the second question, the following methods can be put forward:</p>
<p>Under the current situation of low general knowledge, the need for cooperative organization relies on cooperative instructors to recognize the facts and determine their types. I can't bear to first collect the legal number of people with higher knowledge and good conduct, and quickly organize and establish them. At least one community in each township.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the cooperative, in order to maintain the prosperity of its business, in addition to credit lending, trade with non-members as much as possible. You may as well adopt commercial promotion methods. However, all methods of trading with non-members are the same as members; that is, each person must have a separate household record of surplus, which can only be used to transfer to the shares of the cooperative. Before obtaining the consent of the person to join, temporarily record the deposit account and do not cash it. Only interest can be paid.</p>
<p>When the number of cooperatives in the same place and the same business is more than five, quickly establish a district joint cooperative. When there are more than five district joint cooperatives, quickly form a county joint cooperative. When there are more than ten county joint cooperatives in a province, quickly organize a provincial joint cooperative. The Farmers Bank has the obligation to provide as much funding as possible to county or provincial joint cooperatives. The main officers such as managers must be qualified by the provincial cooperative administrative agency before they can be employed. The expenses of the provincial joint cooperative should be taken out of the interest on the cooperative loans received by the loan banks in the province within the first five years, and a part should be allocated according to the approved budget amount (the budget is approved by the provincial administrative agency).</p>
<p>Provincial and county joint cooperatives may adopt a concurrent system or a single system. Determined by the needs of the facts. All business operations of the cooperatives in the province are controlled by the joint cooperatives at all levels.</p>
<p>When there are more than five joint cooperatives of the same business in each province, quickly organize a national cooperative joint cooperative. Among them, the main office personnel will be appointed by the council of the joint cooperatives after being qualified by the Cooperative Department of the Ministry of Industry. After the budget for expenses is approved by the Cooperative Department, within the first five years, each of the major banks in the country that operate cooperative loans should allocate a part of the interest earned from its cooperative portion to subsidize it.</p>
<p>The above two methods are purely personal opinions. I would like to ask the cooperative pioneers for correction. I deeply hope to criticize it; in order to solve the efficiency problem of cooperative organization in principle, after obtaining a considerable solution, I would like to ask the central cooperative authorities to review it and stipulate its implementation methods. Then it will be fortunate.</p>

<p>96 Once Raised</p>
<p>Last week, from June 29th to July 4th, the Chinese Securities Exchange coincided with the end of the first half of the year's settlement period. The market was closed for two days. Only four days of trading were actually done. The market situation was stable and firm due to the dullness of the current situation. Because the military confrontation in the front is still ongoing, the situation may ease for a while, waiting for the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee. The dull situation is like all the trees waiting for rain to come silently. The market trend is mostly that large households are waiting and watching, retail investors are covering short positions, and the Sichuan gang is slightly absorbing. As for the saying of issuing circulating bonds and raising 96, they are all rumors created by speculators and are not credible. The weekly situation was dull on Monday, and retail investors and the northern gang covered short positions, rising by about one yuan. On Tuesday, sellers sold at high prices, slightly falling back by about half a yuan. Wednesday and Thursday were the settlement period for the first half of the year of the exchange, and the market was closed for two days. On Friday, only 96 government bonds suddenly rose unconsciously, which was nothing but a flash in the pan. Various government bonds hovered and brewed, rising and falling between five cents and one jiao. The market price increased by several jiao to one yuan. As a result of the weekly market price, it rebounded in unison, totaling from five or six jiao to one jiao and a half. The total number of transactions was 25,010,500 yuan. The results of the increase and decrease are compared in the table on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit hundred yuan).</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of various gangs was limited. Only 78, the goods totaled 1,560 stones. However, the sales were also dull, and the stomachs were only handled by the Dalian gang in 5600 packages, so the market situation was normal. If the early japonica rice and thin rice prices do not rise or fall, the situation seems to be softening. Du Yangyuan's tip is firm, and the yin change yuan is similar.</p>

The market price of white japonica was high, and the medium and secondary prices were soft by five or six points. Thin rice was standing firm, and white yuan was slightly tight. The price of Yang Du's guest tip was flat and tired.</p>

<p>Flour Sales in Tianjin Recover</p>
<p>The flour and miscellaneous grains trade in this city has always been the largest by the Tianjin merchant gangs. Since the environment in Tianjin has changed, and it is manipulated by a certain country, the flour transported to Tianjin has gradually decreased. Since last week, it has suddenly turned around. Although the price of futures flour in this city has soared, the China Merchants, Taikoo, and Jardine Matheson ships to Tianjin are all fully loaded. Yesterday, the Yushun ship also loaded 48,000 bags. In total, about 200,000 bags of flour were shipped out last week, as well as 15,000 bags of rice and more than 4,000 bags of broad beans, it is said.</p>

<p>— (Drunken Woodcutter)</p>
<p>A person who has never been subjected to any oppression will never know that the world is deformed. He only knows that life is meant for enjoyment, and thus becomes infected with the bad habit of being decadent. It's like living in an old broken house on a sunny day, not realizing that on a windy and rainy night, there will be no place to live!</p>
<p>When a heavy burden is placed on your shoulders, you can't help but shout "Hang Yu" due to the pressure: this great shout is the reaction aroused by the pressure! Then you realize that a world cannot be based on a few people living mediocre lives! It takes a warrior who dares to fight to survive.</p>
<p>Therefore, we now need a harsh environment to spur us on, and then we can stimulate the dying will to spark a fiery flame and resist the oppression! Hey, friends: the storm is about to come, let's rush through it in the raging wind and rain!</p>
<h3 id="e197">Feelings on Visiting Yue Fei's Tomb <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— A Beggar from the Lake</p>
<p>Passing the Fenglin Temple, I paid my respects at Yue Fei's shrine, my heart shaken with an unspeakable sense of depression and desolation. The setting sun pressed down on the lake, the water red as if boiling, and the hero's lingering tears seemed to resonate with the mountains and rivers. Behind the shrine, several dozen ancient cypress trees embrace the solitary tomb. Their southern branches remain healthy, the spirit undiminished. Even if the grave fields surrounding the lake are not leveled, I fear that the faint ghost fires would have no place to hide. Before the tomb stand statues of Zhongshi, solemn and respectful. There are also statues of treacherous officials, emanating a foul stench of accumulated filth. Whether betraying the enemy or flattering them, the lesson they impart is clear, so that future generations may know what to embrace and what to reject. I often think that during the Southern Song Dynasty, the land was shrinking by hundreds of miles each day, the humiliation and hatred were unprecedented, yet the ruler and his ministers still clung to life in Hangzhou, considering sending envoys to seek peace as the supreme strategy. Their lack of intention to recover lost territories made the need for talents capable of killing enemies and achieving results glaringly apparent. Small wonder that only one Yue Fei could not be tolerated. Moreover, Yue Fei exemplified leading by personal example, expecting civil officials not to love money and military officials not to fear death. Yet at that time, the vast majority were doing the opposite. It was not just Wang Yan, Zhang Jun, and Qin Hui; with such a decline, how could one expect Yue Fei not to die and the Southern Song not to fall? What is particularly painful is that as the enemy forces advanced deeply, internal troubles arose one after another. Consider Yue Fei's memorial to Emperor Gaozong, saying, "The Jin people are establishing Liu Yu in Jiangnan precisely to devastate the Central Plains, using Chinese to attack Chinese, so that they may rest and observe." He meant that those who exploited the chaos to seize power, or those who falsely claimed to be seeking glory, certainly deserved to be killed, but those who planned for the country failed to move and please people with sincerity and trust, leading to mutual slaughter and providing the enemy with opportunities to exploit. How could that be considered a wise strategy? Emperor Gaozong did not understand, and this was another sign of the Song's demise. Though Yue Fei died, his words and deeds can serve as a model for later generations; moreover, they can be used to revitalize the nation. The honoring of his shrine is not merely about paying respects to a past worthy, but about inspiring future generations. Pacing back and forth, lost in thought, the wind and cypresses roared, and the heroic spirit seemed to say: I have twice seen the glory of China submerged by foreign tribes. May future sages cherish our territory! Leaving the shrine, the southern wind was strong, and the lake's waves were surging, waiting to surge again.</p>
<h3 id="e198">University Graduation Ceremony <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>In a classroom where forty or fifty people usually sit, professors shout from the podium, but the future graduates below chatter and make noise, turning the classroom into something resembling a teahouse. Today, however, the situation is different. Hundreds of people are seated in a spacious auditorium, yet it is as silent as an ancient tomb. Besides the habitual sound of waving fans and the occasional applause, only the orderly announcements and speeches from the stage, clear and resonant like a wireless radio, can be heard. It is, after all, the annual, grand, and solemn graduation ceremony!</p>
<p>On the stage sit many dignitaries and representatives from the Ministry of Education in both Chinese robes and Western suits. The principal, with a dignified appearance and a face full of smiles, bows as he greets the guests. Below the stage, the first few rows are filled with graduating students in square caps and black gowns, with an air of excitement like soldiers returning victorious from battle to receive their medals. In the rows behind are the graduates' parents and relatives. Some spirited old gentlemen and ladies, seeing their sons and daughters achieve such glory today, are as delighted as if they had just passed the imperial examinations in the Qing Dynasty, their eyes narrowed in happiness. They must be thinking, "It was not in vain that we mortgaged our fields and sold our houses to cultivate them to this day's harvest." In the rows further back are students who have not yet graduated, some staring enviously, others making faces in jest, each with their own thoughts and demeanor.</p>
<p>The order of the ceremony is largely the same, so I will not dwell on it. In short, whether the speeches by important figures and the principal's address are good or bad, whether the audience understands or not, the conclusion is always thunderous applause. Finally, after the adjournment, one by one, the bachelors of law, bachelors of arts, bachelors of science... gleefully receive their diplomas. However, in this depressed society, there are now more unemployed graduates.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Fine Rain and Slanting Wind Still Leave Traces, a Quiet Night and Silent Man Writes a Letter of Severance</p>
<p>After reading the letter in one breath, Menglan was covered in a cold sweat. She quickly folded the letter and put it back in the envelope. She tucked the envelope into the pocket of her inner garment, pressing it down with her hand. Then, she straightened her clothes and looked around. Although there was no one in sight, she felt her face become even more tense, and even behind her ears felt hot. Standing under the shade of the banana tree, she tugged at the tip of a banana leaf with her right hand, while her left hand tore a slit in the edge of the banana leaf, slowly tearing it towards the middle. She didn't know what kind of mood she was in, but she just tore it strip by strip. After a while, someone suddenly called out: "Mi Sijiang, why aren't you in class? The bell rang a long time ago." Menglan laughed awkwardly and ran to the lecture hall. But her mind was extremely confused, and she didn't understand anything the teacher was saying in class. There were four classes in the afternoon, but she only attended three before going home. The reason she was so eager to go home was that she wanted to reread the letter carefully. However, when she got home, her mother and sister-in-law were all there, asking why she had come home so early today. These were very ordinary words, but when Menglan heard them, she felt as if they were asking her on purpose. She forced herself to reply that the teacher had excused her, and her voice was very soft. Although her family didn't question her further, she didn't immediately go back to her room upstairs. She sat in her sister-in-law's room for a while, then sat in her mother's room for a while, waiting until after dinner before calmly returning to her room upstairs. She first closed the door, then sat down with her back to the door. Then, she took out the letter, first staring at the envelope intently for a while before taking out the letter paper. She held the letter paper in her palm, shielding it from the lamp, and read it line by line. She read all three sheets of paper filled with neat calligraphy. She folded the letter paper and put it back in the envelope, and put the envelope back in her pocket. She hugged her knees with both hands, staring blankly at the lamp. In her heart, she thought that this Mr. Zhang was being a bit reckless. He went to her friend's house to inquire about her name. Wasn't that deliberately letting people know? Although they often met in the alley, they were just friends who admired each other from afar. The things he said in the letter were completely off. He was so bold as to send this kind of letter to the school. Luckily, she had received it herself. If this letter had fallen into someone else's hands, wouldn't it have been a big joke? She thought, first supporting her head with her hands, then interlacing her fingers and pressing them against the edge of the table, supporting her chin. Finally, she picked up a pen, unfolded a piece of paper, and wrote weakly on it. (43)</p>
<h3 id="e201">The Origins of Honeymoons and Wedding Rings <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>In the modern wedding ceremonies now popular in urban areas, the exchange of rings between the bride and groom is already a common sight, and has become a must-have part of the wedding ceremony. Similarly, honeymoons have almost become a necessary act for wealthy and fashionable people after their sweet wedding, and do not strike us as unusual at all. People always live according to custom, but few people think to investigate the origins of how these customs came to be formed. For example, with honeymoons and wedding rings, most people only know that they are imported items, but they are completely ignorant of their origins.</p>
<p>We know that marriage by capture existed everywhere in ancient times, in almost every nation. Where women were scarce and marriage was difficult, marriage by capture was the simplest remedy. And in places that practiced polygamy, the scarcity of women also led to the prevalence of the capture of women.</p>
<p>Traces of this type of marriage can still be seen today in the marriage ceremonies of the Araucanian people of southern Chile. When the groom's friends are negotiating with the bride's father, the groom secretly snatches the bride, mounts a pre-arranged horse, and flees into the forest, ignoring the loud cries of men, women, old and young, and takes the bride to the depths of the woods, and thus the marriage is considered established. Honeymoons, therefore, represent the groom taking the bride away from her home and fleeing to achieve his goal of abduction.</p>
<p>The exchange of rings evolved from the single acceptance of a ring from the groom by the bride. This custom originated in Rome, and the ring was made of iron, used to signify that the wife was bound by the husband. Later, for the sake of beauty, the ring became made of gold, which halved the original intent. Later, the exchange of rings, signifying mutual union, completely eliminated the remaining half of the meaning.</p>

<p>— Liping</p>
<p>After the death of Master of Pragmatic Learning Zhang Taiyan in Suzhou on the 14th, the entire nation mourned in unison. It is said that due to recent illnesses and physical weakness, Mr. Zhang had declined all social engagements, including writing poems and inscriptions, for the sake of recuperating. However, last month, Mr. Song Renying, a faculty member of the Arts Department of Great China University, requested an inscription, and Mr. Zhang, without hesitation, wrote it despite his illness. The characters are ancient and extraordinary, and the poem is even more outstanding. Now that Mr. Zhang has passed away, this piece of calligraphy is all the more precious. Here is the poem: "Shadows slant, leaning against bamboo by the water, the east wind first unfolds a sprig of red. Don't boast of the fairy of Mount Guye as being like ice and snow, to have a wife is truly like Duke Lu."</p>

<p>One might think that an "idler" is free and unfettered, but they are also very likely to receive "scornful glances." If they are polite, they are respectfully called "the leisure class," but if they are impolite, they are cursed as "unemployed vagrants." What can you do?</p>
<p>An "idler" also has one hardship, and what is that? It is:</p>
<p>Important Place,</p>
<p>Idlers Keep Out!</p>
<p>However, since "idlers" are so miserable, shouldn't "idlers" be eliminated from the world? No, definitely not! You only need to look at how many "idlers" there are who "steal half a day of leisure from a busy life." There are many, many of them in movie theaters, dance halls, Mogan Mountain, everywhere. Who doesn't like "leisurely enjoyment"?</p>

<p>On the west bank of the upper reaches of the Konkouré River in Africa, there is a mountain, which is the natural boundary between two tribes. The people on the shaded side of the mountain are more fierce than those on the sunny side, so their strange customs are particularly numerous! The strangest is carving things from the skulls of those they kill. It is said that on the day of the great sacrifice and a week before the completion of the chief's mansion, the terrible duel begins! The duel takes place in a field of lush grass and trees. At the moment of the killing, one only sees the crossing of spears, halberds, sticks, and the wolf-like howls of mourning! After the truce, there are always piles of female corpses, and blood flows into ditches! The victors dismember the corpses with knives, hang them on trees, and feast, sing, and dance under the dim moonlight! The remaining skulls are carved into objects and displayed in thatched huts. As for the people on the sunny side, during the sacrifice to heaven, they bind a woman and beat her to death in front of the chief to thank heaven's will?</p>

<p>The Path to Health</p>
<h3 id="e209">What Kind of Treatment Should Be Used for Gonorrhea? <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>There are many treatments for gonorrhea, including injections, electrotherapy, mechanical therapy, and oral medications. However, among these treatments, except for medication, all require the skill of a surgeon to perform, so as not to cause other problems. And among medications, it is rare to find one that is both effective and reliable. Recently, although there is a transdermal sterilization therapy, it only acts locally and cannot achieve a truly radical cure.</p>
<p>Recently, a white blood cell increasing therapy has become popular in medical circles in various countries, and its miraculous effect is truly amazing. The theory behind it is that increasing white blood cells greatly increases the ability to devour bacteria, so that no matter where in the body the gonorrhea bacteria are hidden or remain in the blood, they are completely eradicated, and gonorrhea is eradicated. This is the biggest reason for the success of non-specific therapy in recent times and opens up a new frontier in the treatment of gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Based on this theory, Mr. Bi De has used lipids from animals and plants, and occasionally dyes, and refined them into a drug called "Kelinong" using special scientific methods. After taking it, it can vigorously stimulate white blood cells, enhance the ability to kill bacteria and resist toxins, and achieve permanent immunity. Therefore, whether or not one has gonorrhea, taking this drug can prevent the occurrence of gonorrhea, or if one is already infected, taking this drug can also be completely cured. For all acute and chronic gonorrhea, urethritis in men, prostatitis, cystitis, orchitis, vulvar gonorrhea, pyorrhea, uterine gonorrhea in women, and arthritis, once taken, it will have a special effect and gradually eradicate the root cause. However, when purchasing, do not mistakenly listen to others and forget to buy cheap, miscellaneous, and inferior products, which may cause a life-threatening situation after taking them. Therefore, be sure to recognize the genuine "Kelinong" brand. Because the medicine of "Kelinong" is kingly and does not harm the stomach or have any adverse stimulation, it has long been popular in various countries.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Summer Gastroenteritis <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Summer gastroenteritis is mostly caused by direct bacterial infection. This is because eating too many melons, fruits, and cold foods stimulates the gastric and intestinal mucosa, or because food has been licked by flies, which introduces a large number of bacteria and causes a toxic effect, leading to gastroenteritis. The symptoms include burning and stinging pain in the stomach, vomiting, nausea, belching of acid water, intestinal rumbling, abdominal diarrhea, even thirty bowel movements a day, fever, and fatigue. Also, in the summer climate, the temperature sometimes drops sharply, which can cause the disease to be contracted, which is also very common. Treatment must be prompt, otherwise, complications such as cholera can be even more dangerous, and it can also turn into chronic gastroenteritis, which cannot be cured in a short period of time.</p>
<p>The treatment of summer gastroenteritis must quickly remove the inflammation in the stomach and the fermented substances in the intestines, and promote digestive function to enhance the absorption of nutrients, so as to restore health. The medicine "Qiang Wei Jing" (Strong Stomach Essence) has these functions, so it has been unanimously regarded by the medical community as an essential medicine for summer in recent years. Because this medicine is a complex yeast preparation, it has special effects on chronic stomach diseases, fear of food, reduced appetite, noisy chest tightness, frequent belching, vomiting, abdominal distension, intermittent pain, and diarrhea, loose stools, and infant vomiting of milk and green stools. It can also speed up intestinal peristalsis, treat constipation well, and contains a large amount of egg yolk lecithin to treat constipation in the elderly and smokers and help with quitting smoking.

<p>The Terrible Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Ever since the German Koch discovered the tubercle bacillus, mankind has known the terror of the tubercle bacillus. It is long and thin in shape, and after staining, it has a red, hair-like fringe all over its body when examined under a microscope, like a bundle of hair that has been cut off. Its volume is extremely small, and each lump of sputum contains 300 million of them. It is hard to imagine that such tiny bacteria can harm the life of our seven-foot body. Its degree of terror is truly above that of a tiger.</p>
<p>The origin of these lung diseases is mostly due to infection through the respiratory system. Colds, minor coughs, are all the beginnings of tuberculosis, but most people ignore them and do not take precautions before they happen. By the time the disease has developed, it is already difficult to remedy. The symptoms of tuberculosis are as follows, such as changes in fever patterns, abnormal pulse, decreased appetite, increased libido, changes in weight, and menstrual difficulties in women (such as amenorrhea or closed menstruation). If you find that you have the above symptoms, you must pay attention to whether you have lung disease and seek treatment. With my experience of more than thirty years in clinical practice, whenever I encounter patients with tuberculosis, in addition to ordering them to be absolutely quiet, pay attention to hygiene, and eat nutritious foods, I usually order them to take "Bu Fei Na Er" (Lung Tonic) and those who are weak take "Bu Ti Kang" (Body Tonic) to increase their health and resist the tubercle bacillus. Women with menstrual difficulties can take "Bu Nu Rong" (Female Tonic), and without exception, they quickly achieve miraculous results. Because these drugs not only have the effect of killing bacteria, but also have the effect of strengthening the body and increasing resistance to the tubercle bacillus.</p>

<p>Orchitis and Reproductive Problems</p>
<p>The testicles are the manufacturing plant for sperm. If these organs become diseased, the mild case will hinder their manufacturing work, and the severe case will completely destroy them, making it impossible to manufacture sperm again, and reproductive ability will be lost from then on. Therefore, the percentage of those who become infertile due to gonorrheal orchitis is very high. Those who suffer from drinking, labor, or improper sexual intercourse and treatment by a doctor during the course of gonorrhea, and other unhygienic conditions, the gonorrhea bacteria enter the epididymis through the vas deferens. After a considerable period of time, one will feel testicular pain and swelling. In the acute phase of orchitis, a high fever of 40 to 41 degrees will always occur, but the chronic phase often develops unconsciously. However, gonorrheal orchitis mostly occurs in the right testicle, called epididymitis. If it is not treated, it will extend to the left side and become bilateral orchitis. Epididymitis still has hope of reproduction, because it still has one testicle that can be preserved, which can produce sperm. However, if both testicles are inflamed and festering, then the hope of fertility is cut off.</p>
<p>Therefore, if a patient discovers epididymitis, they should seek treatment as soon as possible and not delay, lest they regret it later. When I encounter this symptom, I always instruct them to take Kelinong internally to eliminate internal inflammation and swelling, and also use electricity and X-ray therapy to track down the remaining gonorrhea bacteria and restore reproductive power. I always cure it in a very short period of time. After healing, it will never recur, and they can reproduce as usual. There is no chance of failure. However, if the wife has already been infected with gonorrheal leucorrhea, causing lower part erosion, abdominal swelling, irregular menstruation affecting urination, she can also use vaginal tablets as suppositories externally, and take Kelinong internally, which can be cured in a short period of time to avoid mutual infection.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Metamorphoses of Leucorrhea <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Leucorrhea is a common disease among women, and women often overlook it because it is common. Who knows that many diseases arise from leucorrhea. Such as menstrual difficulties, abdominal swelling, the vulva and vaginal passage, all show symptoms of erosion and redness, so every time you urinate, you always feel abnormally stinging pain, so that you cannot excrete as much as possible, storing the remaining urine in the bladder, resulting in cystitis. More from this into the danger of urine poisoning, and because leucorrhea is most prone to attract bacteria, often unexpected symptoms occur.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of leucorrhea, the use of "Kalu's Vaginal Tablets" is most effective. Because this tablet has the effects of resisting bacteria, stopping secretions, smoothing erosion, and relieving inflammation and pain. Each time, put one tablet into the vaginal passage, wash it away the next morning, and you will feel that the leucorrhea is reduced. Use according to the law, and the effect is like a drumbeat. Those who are caused by physical weakness can also take "Bu Nu Rong" (Female Tonic) to strengthen the body, and those who are caused by gonorrhea can take "Kelinong" internally to remove the internal gonorrhea toxins. Internal and external treatment will achieve results faster.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Necessary Conditions for Treating Pulmonary Tuberculosis <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Although the spread of pulmonary tuberculosis is extremely widespread, those infected do not necessarily develop the disease immediately. Almost everyone is attacked by tubercle bacilli in childhood, but not everyone develops the disease. This is a commonly known fact. The occurrence of pulmonary disease must wait until the body's resistance is weakened. Therefore, outwardly, symptoms such as physical wasting, loss of appetite, or occasional mild coughing are signs of pulmonary tuberculosis. The only condition at this time is quiet rest, saving brainpower and labor, and taking anti-tuberculosis preparations. If pulmonary tuberculosis has already formed, reaching the second or third stage, then quiet therapy, diet therapy, and drug therapy are all necessary conditions for recovery. Diet therapy means eating more supplements to increase nutrition. Quiet therapy means getting more sleep and avoiding excessive excitement of the nerves. As for drug therapy, traditional preparations often do not fully meet the doctor's intentions, as their effectiveness is at most only to relieve cough and reduce phlegm. Although they have the effect of treating the disease, they lack the power to prevent tuberculosis, so they are not very suitable.</p>
<p>Since the flourishing of modern science, it has been known that one method for treating pulmonary disease is to increase resistance. Its effectiveness and great achievements in preventing disease often exceed our expectations. Upon investigation, this preparation is a medicine called "Bu Fei Na Er" [Lung Nourishing Nall]. In treating tuberculosis, it has significant therapeutic effects on hemoptysis, coughing with phlegm, shortness of breath, chest pain, loss of appetite, fatigue, night sweats, etc. This medicine is particularly good at expelling phlegm and suppressing cough, so it has remarkable effects on chronic coughs, persistent phlegm, senile asthma, childhood pertussis, colds, etc. Its power to nourish the body and prevent tuberculosis is unmatched by other medicines. For pulmonary tuberculosis combined with neurasthenia, insomnia, palpitations, forgetfulness, seminal emission and back pain in men, and menstrual disorders in women, "Bu Ti Kang" [Body Strengthening Kang] for men and "Bu Nü Rong" [Beauty Supplement] for women can be taken simultaneously with this medicine. This will eliminate seminal emission, disappear menstrual disorders, and alleviate various symptoms of weakness and tuberculosis.</p>
<h3 id="e215">The Aging of Sexual Nerves <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>How can it be restored and treated?</p>
<p>The reason why people continue to survive and work tirelessly is that the endocrine function is vigorous, continuing its secretory work to irrigate the whole body. These endocrine secretions come from various organ glands, enter the blood, and are distributed throughout the body. Their function is just like fuel for a car. With it, the body is strong and active; without it, actions are sluggish, the mind is not sharp, thinking is slow, the complexion is haggard, hair turns white, and the forehead wrinkles, presenting a premature aging appearance. Those suffering from aging sexual nerves can certainly understand this. Therefore, the theory of endocrinology has become very popular recently, hoping to save this premature aging phenomenon and extend human survival indefinitely. This is truly a great invention for human happiness.</p>
<p>However, the results of general scholars' research still have many shortcomings and have not yet achieved the expected effect. Only the "Bu Ti Kang" [Body Strengthening Kang] for men and "Bu Nü Rong" [Beauty Supplement] for women invented by Mr. Mei Lun have remarkable efficacy and can be called a unique step in endocrine therapy. Examining their raw materials, they are extracted from the testicles and ovaries of strong animals, and hormones are extracted separately and made into medicine. Numerous animal experiments have been conducted, and the results have been satisfactory. After being taken by millions of people, it has indeed had the expected effect. Scientists around the world have praised these two medicines as "super special inventions." All male seminal emission, spermatorrhea, impotence, and underdevelopment caused by masturbation or excessive sexual activity, as well as female menstrual disorders, flat breasts and buttocks like a man, and infertility after prolonged marriage, have been found to be very effective after taking the medicine. This is because the internal endocrine function of the body is vigorous, like a car getting gasoline, making the limbs and bones unusually invigorated. These two medicines have long been used clinically by major hospitals around the world. It is said that Chinese doctors are also seeing and hearing about cases of healing male and female sexual nerve aging with these two medicines.</p>

<p>Foreskin Eversion</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Lin Xuncong previously contracted gonorrhea after drinking and visiting prostitutes. Recommended by Dr. Deng Yuanhe, he took "Ke Lin Nong" [Clean Nong]. After taking only one bottle, he stopped taking it because the inflammation subsided. He continued to exercise, and before long, the inflammation recurred, with burning and stinging pain in the urethra, hindering urination, and an extremely urgent urge to urinate, with thick pus discharging, causing unusual pain and endless cries. At this time, the foreskin was also everted and swollen. He then purchased "Ke Lin Nong" [Clean Nong] from the pharmacy and took it again. After taking it, the inflammation subsided again. Learning from his previous mistake of stopping treatment halfway, he continued to take it for about three weeks, and the swelling and pain completely disappeared, with clear urine, no different from before the illness. It is said that it has not recurred to this day.</p>
<p>Weak Body Due to Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Yin Lizun was usually healthy, but after contracting gonorrhea, he repeatedly failed to treat it, leading to the subsequent development of seminal vesicle inflammation and occasional seminal emission. As a result, his body weakened, his head became dizzy, his mind became muddled, and he was often depressed and pessimistic. He repeatedly sought medical treatment, but to no avail. Later, recommended by Dr. Dai De, he switched to taking "Ke Lin Nong" [Clean Nong] internally to clear away the gonorrheal toxins and promote the internal elimination of inflammation. At the same time, he also took "Bu Ti Kang" [Body Strengthening Kang] to transform the sexual tissues and strengthen his nerves. After taking it for less than ten days, the disease was already seven or eight parts gone. He then continued to take it for more than ten days, and the disease suddenly disappeared. Mr. Yin also learned that his wife had contracted gonorrhea, so she also took "Ke Lin Nong" [Clean Nong] internally and used "Ka Er Xue Di Shi Yin Dao Pian" [Car Snow Dishi Vaginal Tablets] externally as a suppository. After taking them for several weeks, she also recovered. It is said that she now has a two-year-old son.</p>
<p>Rectal Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Lu Yiwen originally had gonorrhea, which later turned into rectal gonorrhea. Pus and blood were constantly discharged from the anus, and he felt pain during bowel movements. Mr. Lu initially thought it was hemorrhoids and sought treatment from a hemorrhoid specialist. Unexpectedly, after a detailed examination, he was diagnosed with rectal gonorrhea and was recommended to take the special "Ke Lin Nong" [Clean Nong] medicine for gonorrhea. After taking it for less than four or five weeks, he completely recovered.</p>
<p>Female Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Patient Mrs. Zhou was infected with vaginal gonorrhea by her husband, who had gonorrhea. The local area was severely eroded, with yellow and white fluid draining, to the point where she could not urinate, and her menstruation was disrupted. Repeated treatments were ineffective. Later, recommended by Dr. Jin Yueren, she took "Ke Lin Nong" [Clean Nong] internally and used "Ka Er Xue Di Shi Yin Dao Pian" [Car Snow Dishi Vaginal Tablets] externally to wash away the secretions in the affected area. Fortunately, she saw results in just a few weeks, with reduced discharge and pain. She then continued to take the medicine for another week and recovered. Later, she also took "Bu Nü Rong" [Beauty Supplement] to regulate her menstruation, which was also cured in a short period of time.</p>

<p>Curing seminal emission is also a difficult task, because for those who have nocturnal emission with dreams, even if taking medicine can stop the emission, erotic dreams still occur frequently, so how can the emission be stopped? Or if someone has suffered from this for a long time and the seminal ducts are relaxed, if the sexual tissues are not transformed, the previous methods are reversed, and "Yu Jing Pian" [Sperm Cultivating Tablets] are made based on the principle of calming the nerves. After taking this medicine, it is effective for seminal emission regardless of frequency, scanty or profuse discharge, nocturnal emission during urination and bowel movements, seminal leakage, and various neurasthenia, dizziness, and depression caused by seminal emission. It can also enhance willpower, so masturbation can be stopped.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Elementary School Students Enter the Mountains to Seek the Tao and Immortality <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>According to recent news reports, two fourteen-year-old children in this city have successively entered the mountains to seek the Tao and immortality. These two children are fourth-grade students at a certain elementary school. They usually enjoy reading chivalry novels and are like-minded and very good friends. They often confide to their classmates that they want to go to famous mountains such as Kunlun and Emei to seek teachers and learn skills, in order to serve the country. Unexpectedly, the two of them agreed to leave together last Sunday, practicing imitating the stories of chivalrous heroes.</p>
<p>I remember that similar things happened in Shanghai before? This kind of foolish behavior is obviously harmed by novels. They usually like to read chivalry novels and have seen many stories of chivalrous heroes in books, so they were fascinated for a while and imitated them, entering the mountains to seek teachers and learn skills, hoping to become a character in a story. Their thinking is naive, and they cannot distinguish that the plots in the novels are absurd and unfounded, so they cannot avoid being deceived and making whimsical behaviors.</p>
<p>Regarding this fact, what is worthy of attention is the poor social education in our country. The stories of chivalrous heroes are performed very lively on stage all year round. The film industry also had a vogue for this kind of film for a period of time. As a result of the impact, the games that a group of children play are all tricks of flying swords to take people's heads. There are also small book stalls in various alleys and by the roadside, and small books of the chivalrous hero type are everywhere. Most of the patrons of these small book stalls are children. As a result, I don’t know how many people have been harmed? The matter of entering the mountains to seek the Tao and immortality is just one example.</p>
<p>Those generally engaged in education and culture here cannot turn a blind eye. The existence of bad reading materials on the market is very dangerous and should be eliminated. Like chivalry novels, they are not only useless but also harmful. However, this kind of book is everywhere in the market and is very popular. No wonder children want to write after being lured. As for schools and families, they must also pay close attention. Usually, they should fully guide children's reading and not let them indiscriminately read bad books. It is best to have several kinds of children's reading materials available for children to read, which is very beneficial in terms of seeking knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Song of a Wanderer <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Hua</p>
<p>Once I left Bangkok, the capital of Siam filled with tropical sentiments, I never stopped thinking about it, or about those enthusiastic friends who had wandered together.</p>
<p>I love the southern country, I love Bangkok, and I especially love the summer of Bangkok and the summer nights of Bangkok.</p>
<p>How lovely, Bangkok in the summer night, the summer night on the Mekong River! The river sang softly, gently lapping against the hull of the boat. We slept on the boat (the boat was our home), watched the bright moon, watched the shining stars, watched the vast and azure sky. We listened to the river whispering in our ears, and to the sailors’ songs, near and far, brought by the southern wind.</p>
<p>In the shadow, the river was black; in the moonlight, the river was white. Open the window on the cabin allowed the fragrance of rice to come in from the fields in June, and swarms of moths flapped and fluttered, playing around the lamps. We were waiting for the tide, ready to weigh anchor. It was at this time that the old uncle, chewing on his oily bamboo pipe, told us, with an expression of surprise and trembling voice, about how they came to this wild country decades ago, the weather like a raging fire, the natives like wild animals, and the battles with big snakes and tigers. These experiences, like legends, like the heroes and warriors of the Middle Ages (full of sweat, tears, and the breath of blood), fascinated us, moved us, and bewitched us. Ah, the summer nights of Bangkok are beautiful, the summer nights of Bangkok are mysterious.</p>
<p>How could I not love Bangkok and its summer, its summer nights? How could I forget those passionate friends, struggling on the edge of life and death?</p>
<p>I gaze at the clouds in the southern country, wishing them good health.</p>
<p>In Bangkok, I had some friends who had wandered together.</p>
<p>We were a group of young and suffering people. I had been expelled from Singapore and escaped to Siam, and I mingled in their ranks, becoming a sailor. I was a young school teacher, but because we were all young, we eliminated all barriers. I had also gone with them to Sanpari, walking a hundred and ten miles a day on uneven mountain roads and waterways. At night we stayed in the homes of the natives, listening to the roar of the "Bo Gong" in the quiet night.</p>
<p>After the business of the "Huo Long" (machine rice mill) closed down, we lost our jobs. In those days, we desperately drank strong wine and coffee with the remaining money, and we also gambled all night long. Until there wasn't half a "Dong" (currency) on us, we ran blindly on the streets hungry, whistling popular tunes. Or we would walk to the edge of Miao Nan Bridge outside the city, stand on top of a small pile of garbage, and listen to the groans of women suffering childbirth. We did not envy the frozen comfort and vulgar happiness, and we did not desire the moldy leisure, but we lived a life full of romantic interest, tense and adventurous. We had the agile and shrewd eyes of hunters, looking directly at life, and always making enthusiastic nights for the future.</p>
<p>Naturally, in such days, we repeatedly fell from the cutting edge of life, but each time we climbed up stubbornly, struggling stubbornly. Many times we climbed up, and many times we were struck down again by the sledgehammer of life. We were not tired and not discouraged, although hope often cheated us out of a lot of time, painting a large area of gray stains in the pages of our lives.</p>
<p>One night, walking on the bustling streets. The bright street lights suddenly made me see the faces of my companions clearly. In this way, I thought that I naturally had a messy hair, and under this dirty and long hair, there must be two dark and sunken eyes, as well as a thin face and rough black mustaches. I thought quietly: "Life, ah!" But I laughed like crazy, even shaking my body.</p>
<p>"Old San, what are you laughing at?" My companion showed a look of surprise on his face.</p>
<p>"I'm laughing that life can't kill us!" I said. So we pooled the remaining money in each person's pocket and went to a "Ku Pi" (bitter skin) store to drink a few cups of strong coffee.</p>
<p>Back on the boat, the old uncle was fast asleep. Moonlight flooded our boat. We whistled, took off our clothes, and slipped into the river one after another, swimming in the lukewarm river.</p>
<p>We swam, we talked, we sang, when the first sea tide rushed into the Mekong River.</p>
<p>Since the early autumn of that year, I left Bangkok, and it has been five years now. I always think of them, these friends who have wandered together. I also often think of that summer full of romantic interest!</p>
<p>Under the cruel treatment in a foreign country, and under the exploitation of life, the friends should have scattered, right? I look at the clouds in the southern country, wishing them good health.</p>

<p>— Especially</p>
<p>Mandarin ducks playing in the Lotus River; outside the window, the breeze is clear, and the swallows fly in pairs, bamboo bridge on both sides - green willows and beautiful flowers. A shepherd boy on a cattle's back plays the flute: green mountains and green water are so leisurely!</p>
<p>The singing cut through the trembling treetops. In the mouth of the girl, the melody always had an indescribable desolation, as if there was infinite melancholy, wanting to use this song to tell the sympathetic person to understand.</p>
<p>When autumn and summer meet, wild vines hang down from the treetops like snakes, and the foliage is so dense that it can hide several people without revealing any trace. Wild insects chirped, hiding in the grass, and the moonlight peeked at this silvery nature. Here, Yamani - the girl filled with desolation - quietly pushed open the door, looked around, hastily passed through the path in front of the house, let the leaves tightly cover her body, stepped on the bamboo bridge, and clearly shouted the usual song.</p>

<p>— Gao Zhuo</p>
<p>(V) Love and Marriage</p>
<p>Men and women should not touch hands directly, is an ancient Chinese etiquette. This feudal etiquette has ruled Chinese society for thousands of years; under this etiquette, I don’t know how many tragedies have been staged, and how many hearts of loving men and women have been worn out. Now, some local men and women have gained the freedom of social interaction, but I don't know how many disputes and sacrifices have been made to obtain it. However, among the Miao people, the social interaction between men and women has always been widespread and absolutely free. The deeds of love between men and women are also extremely fragrant and beautiful. As mentioned earlier, the Miao people are mostly farmers, so the places for young Miao people to socialize and fall in love are naturally mostly in the fields in the wild, on the mountains, and in the forests. The Miao people are very good at singing, and when working in the fields, they always sing to entertain themselves, but they often use this as a tool to seduce the opposite sex. In July, the south wind blows, and the barley turns yellow in the fields. The Miao people go to work in the suburbs, and at this time, you can hear the loud and melodious singing of the young Miao people everywhere, which is often based on burning love. Sometimes, a man and a woman are far apart, unable to see each other and only able to hear each other's singing. At first, they reciprocate with love songs, continuously, and gradually approach each other. The blazing love finally makes them meet together, and they reach the highest point of love in a short time.</p>
<p>The Miao people's love is free, and parents do not hinder all the actions of their children. Young men can openly accompany their lovers to their homes to stay overnight, but when it comes to having children, it is a difficult time for this pair of lovers. Because, according to the superstitions of the Miao people, it is considered unlucky to have children at home. If they give birth at home, they must be expelled or given more cruel punishment. Therefore, when it is about to give birth, they must first set up a temporary shed for the pregnant woman outdoors to temporarily protect from the wind and rain.</p>
<p>That was a temptation. Passing by the entrance of the Laha Temple, she always thought: Mao'erbao might be waiting for me inside? Really, it's been two months, and his family is watching him to prevent him from coming out for fear of causing trouble. Hmph, the guardian cannot control the burning heart! She laughed. However, she never had the courage to go into the temple. She often thought of the way the little servant in charge of the temple squeezed his eyebrows and made eyes, and then thought of his smelly clothes and smelly teeth, she couldn't help but feel sick. She didn't dare to stay longer, and walked along the fence to the west of the village.</p>
<p>(Laha Temple, I don't know the name, I only know that the years have stripped away the details. The deity can't be distinguished from the appearance.)</p>
<p>Standing in front of Mao'erbao's window, there were no lights. The slanted moon projected her entire body, and a shadow was tightly printed on the window paper. It seemed that he was already asleep? No, maybe he hasn't come back from outside. How to tell him this unfortunate thing? Looking through the small hole, blackness covered her vision, and knocking on the window -</p>
<p>- "Who is it?" The voice was obviously his uncle's. She jumped in fright, quickly pulled back her steps, and ran back the way she came! A figure was chasing behind her, and the dog kept barking, like a criminal, hiding in the茂葉 by the bridge.</p>
<p>Rumors quickly spread throughout the mountain village, as if singing the news: what kind of fun history happened between Yamani and Mao'erbao at the foot of the mountain, what Mao'erbao was being watched and not allowed to go out, and what one hundred and seventy yuan had mortgaged Yamani to Lao Hei (because Yamani's father owed Lao Hei an uncleared debt). When there was empty time, these things easily hung on everyone's lips.</p>
<p>The days passed quickly. On that day, red candles were lit everywhere in Yamani's hall, and the women gathered together whispering -</p>
<p>- Yamani is getting married today, and soon she will be the young lady of the big house! The side room of Laha Temple must be very lively. But love burned through the young people's hearts. Taking a free hand, Yamani secretly opened the back door, preparing to regain her past freedom and walk the road to the west of the village again. The little servant of the Laha Temple suddenly jumped out of the temple and blocked her path! -</p>
<p>- It's so late, where are you going? She was embarrassed, the stars winked, and it was still so quiet all around.</p>
<p>- Look, Yamani is secretly meeting Mao'erbao! The little servant laughed wildly, clapping his hands, shouting, and running from the temple gate to the west of the village!</p>
<p>The sleeping people woke up, looking at each other with panicked expressions. On this night, Yamani was tied to a pillar in the Laha Temple, and leather whips rolled away her flesh. Blood dripped on the brick floor, dying the clothes of the whip dancer, and splashing on the spectators.</p>
<p>The news quickly spread out again. Then Mao'erbao was sent to the county town hundreds of miles away.</p>
<p>A month later, Laha Temple opened a grand feast. Yamani was sculpted like a clay Bodhisattva, and pushed and shoved onto the temple hall. - Go, go and see, this is the day that Lao Hei takes her as his wife!</p>
<p>At midnight, the moonlight was very bright. At the north corner, under the densely flowered branches, a strong man was lying in ambush. He held a crescent-shaped sharp knife in his right hand, shining with cold light under the moonlight. Quickly, he crossed the bamboo bridge, picked some branches and wrapped them around his body, and hid in a corner of the temple. Listen, there wasn't a sound. Quietly, he sneaked to the back door, jumped into the house, and his eyes were bursting with fire. He was angry, he was crazy, and like a wild beast, he stabbed the sharp knife into Lao Hei's back. Then, together, they crossed the mountain fields, stood on the bamboo bridge, and threw themselves into the heart of the river. The water splashed up a huge echo, and the corpses, following the smooth river, floated embracing each other towards the lower end.</p>

<p>In the deep of night, as red slumber descends, wild imaginings often take the opportunity to bloom, more vexing than a dragonfly aimlessly blundering into a spider's web, the more it struggles, the less it can escape. Along with this vexation surge feelings of melancholy and wisps of sorrow, thinly drifting across the lake of my heart. If, by chance, from afar comes the faint and lingering sound of an automobile horn, falling into the silent air, or beneath the silent window, from the alley below, the sound of a night vendor tapping on a wooden clapper, with cries like a person lamenting, as if someone is playing a mixed and disordered tune on a broken stringed instrument.</p>

<p>It is not musical, but a sorrowful song. I am wrapped in it, slowly, it overwhelms me. I cannot resist it, and even worthless tears flow profusely. I don't know the reason, but at this moment, my heart is indeed too fragile, seemingly unable to withstand excessive stimulation. And that calling, that sound of the wooden clapper, is clear, perfectly layering another layer of sorrowful meaning upon my already too lonely feelings.</p>
<p>Every night, every night, when I can't sleep, I hear the night vendor tapping his wooden clapper, hoarsely calling out with a raspy voice, walking through the alley, then soon walking back, sometimes faint, sometimes loud and clear, my thoughts also rising and falling like the tide. So, I close my eyes and search my mind, and I see a person, carrying a heavy burden, with a kerosene lamp lit at the front end, the weak light shining on the ground. Perhaps it is a night without moon or stars, and the streetlights high on the wooden poles are shrouded in thick dew, almost as if they don't exist. Dragging their own shadow like this, holding onto a humble hope, they walk through every indifferent street, every alley, and every dark place, colliding with the unpredictable rewards of fate. Whether it's a day with strong winds, a day with rain and snow, or a clear day, it's always a solitary figure, a shadow, and two burdens, starting from dusk and continuing until late at night and dawn. Life is an endless continuation of darkness...</p>
<p>The cries and the sound of the wooden clapper of the familiar night vendor often give me a kind of pity that is very distant from them, and at the same time make me think of the distance between people's labor and rest. And this kind of person's life is like a rusty, rotten piece of copper, never able to sprout a brilliant light, and the whip of life lashes them day and night.</p>
<p>But their strength to endure all the tricks of cruel fate is worthy of praise.</p>

<p>The Lost Lamb</p>
<p>The song "Fishing Light Song" is already an extremely popular song, and its melody has spread throughout China.</p>
<p>After "Fishing Light Song," another song, "The Lost Lamb," has been created. Both the lyrics and music of this song are excellent.</p>
<p>The lyrics for this song are by Cai Chusheng, the music is by Ren Guang, and it is sung by Chen Juanjuan. It has been recorded by Pathé Records, and the sheet music is currently being printed and will soon be distributed to all sectors of society.</p>
<p>Below are the lyrics for "The Lost Lamb":</p>
<p>Moonlight shines on the village,</p>
<p>The village is desolate, with no grain to cook;</p>
<p>Taxes are heavy, and the rice and wheat fields are barren!</p>
<p>The moon is round, shining on the fence,</p>
<p>The dogs by the fence cannot sleep;</p>
<p>They are tormented by hunger and cold, with tears streaming down!</p>
<p>The moon is bright, shining on the pond,</p>
<p>The pond is dry, making planting difficult;</p>
<p>They wander to other places, crying by the roadside!</p>
<p>The moon is bright, shining on other places,</p>
<p>The children in other places yearn with broken hearts;</p>
<p>When will they return to plant new seedlings?</p>
<p>The moon is gentle, shining on the riverbank,</p>
<p>The riverbank bursts, like a mountain shifting;</p>
<p>Families are washed away, separated by death!</p>
<p>The moon is dim, shining on the wasteland,</p>
<p>The bones on the wasteland are as white as frost;</p>
<p>And again, we hear the war drums rising from all directions!</p>
<p>The moon is cool, shining on the lamb,</p>
<p>The lamb is lost, suffering disaster;</p>
<p>Where on earth can it find its parents?</p>
<p>The moon is clear, shining on the heart of heaven,</p>
<p>Does the heart of heaven not know of the child's drifting?</p>
<p>Letting the wind blow and the rain beat, allowing it to be bullied?</p>
<p>The moon is faint, shining on the sea,</p>
<p>The sea flows forever, never returning;</p>
<p>The suffering child has no home and cannot return!</p>
<p>The moon shines on tattered clothes,</p>
<p>The tattered clothes are thin and frayed;</p>
<p>Freezing to death by the roadside, with no one to care!</p>
<p>The moon is hazy, shining on tall houses,</p>
<p>Tall houses filled with laughter, as if mad;</p>
<p>The suffering child is hungry and hesitating!</p>
<p>The moon is bleak, shining on the beach,</p>
<p>The beach is deserted, the night long and endless;</p>
<p>The suffering child's blood and tears have already run dry!</p>

<p>China 4 (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening: "Consort Fei Assassinating the Traitor"</p>
<p>It is said that the rebel forces captured Beijing. Magpies and crows flew in disarray in the Forbidden City. The officials' families mostly sought death. The Ming Emperor hanged himself at Longevity Pavilion. Rebel soldiers and generals poured in, committing rape, plunder, and atrocities like beasts. Corpses piled up in the Taiye Pond. Therefore, Consort Fei drowned herself but did not sink. The rebel soldiers were overjoyed at the sight and dragged her to the commander's camp. That rebel general, named Yao Qi, originally surnamed Hao, had always harbored wicked intentions. Moreover, Consort Fei's beauty was rare in the world, like a lotus emerging from the water. He ordered her to change out of her wet clothes, but Consort Fei refused. Because she secretly hid a sharp weapon sewn into her waistband. Otherwise, the secret would be revealed and everything would be ruined. She said to Yao Qi in a soft voice, "I am from a noble family and should be respected. If the commander truly loves me, he should formally marry me with the emperor's approval." The beauty under the lamplight was even more alluring, and Consort Fei drank with a semblance of affection. After drinking to the point of being drunk, she returned to her room. As soon as she got into bed, she snored loudly like a clay figure. Consort Fei sent the others away. Immediately, with hatred, she tore open the seam of her waistband, revealing two daggers, and courage arose in her. Holding them in both hands, she walked non-stop. She fiercely stabbed the bandit in the chest. Oh, her cry sounded like a thunderclap. Consort Fei, fearing torture, quickly plunged the steel blade in her left hand into herself. She fell to the ground with a thud, shedding fresh blood. She went to follow the Ming Emperor and meet their ancestors. Her chastity, bravery, and fortitude were rare in the world, especially for a dancer. Her fragrant name will be remembered for eternity in history, putting to shame that group of civil and military officials in the court, and even surpassing the stories of the past, inspiring admiration.</p>

<h3 id="e229">Shanghai Professional Circles National Salvation Association Letter to the Experimental Theatre <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Respected Director, regarding the patriotic drama performed by your theater, which has suffered unreasonable oppression from the Public Concession工部局, our association believes that this act by the Concession authorities is an insult to Chinese人格 and disregards international treaties. We will use the strength of all our members as a backing for your theater, and hope to continue to fight, to seek justice, in order to overcome the adverse environment and eliminate obstacles to the national liberation movement. We are at a loss for words and extremely indignant. Respectfully, to the Experimental Theatre, Shanghai Professional Circles National Salvation Association</p>
<h3 id="e230">A Word on "The Lost Lamb" <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>A film, in every aspect, should have its own creation, because being able to do so shows its life is lively, healthy, and vigorous.</p>
<p>"The Lost Lamb" was indeed created in this creative spirit.</p>
<p>Cai Chusheng's serious attitude towards art is truly admirable. He handles every scene and every shot with great care, so his works require extremely long production times and a large amount of capital. However, every one of his works causes a sensation.</p>
<p>"The Lost Lamb" is not only extremely novel in its form of performance, but also extremely rich and powerful in its content. Among Cai Chusheng's many works, this can be considered a work of even greater value.</p>
<p>Cai Chusheng is indeed making his films wearing a ghost mask. If you have seen "The Lost Lamb," then you will feel that this ghost mask, staring at reality, is much gloomier and angrier than when he made "Fishing Light Song."</p>

<h3 id="e231">Zuo Ming's Hard Work Spirit <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>Zuo Ming is a promising director among Chinese directors. Tianyi's new film "The Strange Adventures of Mr. Wang" is his debut work. This film has been in production for nearly a month since filming began, and more than 8,000 feet of film have been shot, of which only one-third is usable. The remaining two-thirds are failed shots (N.G.). According to Kay Mela Manshen Yongshi, the shots are not bad due to "insufficient lighting" or "blurred lens," but purely because Director Zuo takes filming seriously. If the actors make a slight mistake in their performance or their acting is not powerful enough, it must be reshot. The other day, a shot of Mrs. Chen's family's teacher Wang was reshot as many as nine times. Also, yesterday, a major scene of Mr. Wang and Little Chen et al. at the entrance of the gangster's house was filmed. Director Zuo rehearsed each shot many times in advance out of seriousness, and then started filming. Mr. Wang "Jie," because of his seniority, was unwilling to prolong the rehearsal time in the sunlight, and grumbled in his mouth. Mr. Shao Cunren mediated, and Director Zuo anxiously pleaded with Mr. Wang: "They can't act, please help them!" Mr. Wang dared not complain any further. This scene took a full five hours, Little Chen fainted from the heat, and Mr. Wang was covered in sweat, fully setting off Director Zuo's spirit of hard work!</p>
<p>Director Zuo, our newcomer! We hope you will continue to work hard!</p>
