<p>蔣院長致訓詞</p>
<p>（南京）蔣院長於十日晨、在地方行政會議訓詞、題為「地方行政會議之宗旨與要點、」原詞如下、</p>
<p>「綱目」　會議之宗旨、在檢討地方行政實效、以改革弊害、增進效能、　會議之要點、一·各人應儘量貢獻研究之材料、二·現行各行政法規制度之斟酌損益、（特別注意經費使用之合理化）、三·地方政府各部門之密切連繫、四·敎育應注重充實師資、與訓練失業靑年、五·民政方面最切要工作、（甲）改良警政、（乙）舉辦地政、　希望互相觀摩研討、使本會議得最圓滿之效果、</p>
<p>各位同志、前年三月在南昌召集各省高級行政人員會議、討論改進地方行政事宜、當時曾的定此種會議、可每年舉行一决、旣可聽取各地的報吿、亦藉以討論改進的途徑、但去年本席駐在四川、交通不便、未克召集、現在由行政院召集各省廳長專員、在此舉行第二决地方行政會議、在今天開會的時候、想先將召集會議的宗旨和討論的要點、簡略的向大家報吿、大槪我們每决會議、最主耍目的、就是要就過去一年以來、各地方行政特別是民政敎育兩項、為內政的基本、我們要就其實施情况、與各人所得的實際經騐、藉此會議的機會、大家報吿出來、相互觀摩、共同研討以期改進過去的缺點、解决當前的困難、使今後的地方行政、能够加速的推進、這就是我們會議的宗旨、至於會議的要點、槪括的說起來、的有以下幾項、第一、我們會議最大的目的、旣是要拿我們各地方施政的實况、和各人的經驗做材料來研究、以求增加地方行政的效率、那末我們大家參加會議最耍緊的一項基本的任務、當然就是要將各地施政的實况、和自己的經騐允其是自己最近特殊的心得、以及所遇到的困難、和所發現缺點、儘量貢獻於大會、使大家得到很好的材料來研究、第二、關於現得各種行政法規制度、無論是關於組織人事經費那一方面的法規或制度、在各地究竟能吾實行、有無窒礙、以及實施的情形如何、利害如何、希望大家在此决會議的時候、要加以客觀的檢討和切實的研究、然後可以斟酌損益、以期盡善、因為現在我們的國家、一切還在艱難創造之中、允其是各地的情形很多差別　所以一種法規一個制度、要想全國各地普通適用、是很困難的、所以一切法規制度、必須右中央所訂的原則之下、適應各地特殊的情况、斟酌損益、多方調整救濟、然後可以運用靈活、措施得當、這伴事情、就是耍我們參加會議的各位同志盡心討論、允其是經費一項、現在無論在中央與地方、都成了一個很困難的問題、我們要解决這個問題、不外開源和節流兩個途徑、但是除將來交通農礦及其有關各經濟事業、能够發達以後、可以充裕員源之外、照現在各方面的情形看起來、可以說、都是無源可開、至於節流的辦法、最近中央與各地方都很注重、値此困難時期、大家當然應該盡量節的、以一文錢當十文用、不過就目前的情况而論、恐怕各地所能節省出來的經費、也很有限、我們旣不能開源、又很難節流、然則今後各種經費的問題、如何解决呢、本席以為最要緊的、而且比較易於做到的辦法、就是就現有的經費、通盤籌算、分別事業之本末輕重、先後緩急、與所能發生效益之大小、斟酌增减、予以合理的調劑、總須移緩就急、移輕就重、化無用為有用、我想現在各地的經費雖然困難、如果照這個原則詳細統籌、適當支配、政治上一定可以增進很大的效能、例如保安團隊的經費、從前是縣自為政、不可統計、現在各省已經全區或全省統一了、比以前便要减少很多濫收與浪用的經費、以後我們如果再設法整理、我相信一定再可節省經費、現在各地花費很大一筆經費、養了保安團、有些腐敗的旣不像國防軍、也不像地方的軍隊、這種不三不四的軍隊、對國家旣無效益、對地方允多擾害、賓在應該裁汰、其節餘的經費、拿來辦理保甲、或改良警察、其效用一定要比現在增多、這不過舉其一例而言、其他各方面可以裁减緊縮、化無用為有用的經費很多、只要各位同志能以「公忠謀國」的心思、切實討論、一定可以想出辦法、得到相當的效果、第三、近年各地行政效率、不能十分增進的原因、當然很多、而民財敎建各廳之間、缺乏橫的連絡、每每各廳只顧各應的事情、不能眞正打成一片、也是重要原因之一、我們要曉得一個省政府、原來是整個的、所以要分設四廳、不過為工作的便利、使各負專責、以便推動而已、在精神與事業上、原來是整個不可分的、允其是各廳一切工作之推進、事業之發展、無不是成敗得失、息息相關、祗有大家通力合作、决不好各自為政、所以民政一定耍兼顧到財政敎育和建設、敎育一定要兼顧到民政財政與建設、任何一廳、必須兼顧到其餘三廳、允其是民政與敎育、關係格外密切、彼此更要確實連絡、必須如此、然後可以彼此相得益彰、無論民財敎建那一廳的事情、都可以事半功倍、兼程並進、所以此次會議、雖然各省的財政和建設廳長沒有出席、各位民政和敎育廳長、對於各省財政和建設方面的事情、也應當注意討論同時討論民政和敎育方面的事情、也務必兼顧財政和建設方面的情形、所有各廳之間、如何互助合作、打成一片、以期增進行政效能的辦法、也希望大家在此决會議時注意討論、第四、我們今後要發展敎育、一方面固然要設法普及、以求數量的增加、但一方面允其耍力求質的改良、以期進步、就我們現在的力量與事實上的需要而論、目前對於敎育、應當先謀質的改進、而數量的擴充、還在其决、因為現在我們國家社會最嚴重的問題、還不是能識字的國民或已受敎育者、數目太少、而是這些在國民總數中僅佔極少數的已受敎育的分子、知識能力、多不健全、大多數沒有適當的職業、負學校敎育與社會敎育的責任的、又不能好好的敎導一般缺乏知識的普通國民、與學齡兒童、所以我們要發展敎育、一定先要改良敎育、耍改良敎育、一定先要改良師資、允其是要訓練出一大批中小學敎師、如果中小學敎師不能健全、不明敎育的目的和敎師的責任、我們的敎育無論如何普及、也沒有用、而且不良的敎育會推廣、在不良的敎育之下、所敎出來的識字的人愈多、我們的社會國家愈不能受益、所以今後無論是中央和各地方、一定要先注意培養健全的師資、以改進敎育、先在質的方面能够改進、然後再在量的方面逐漸推廣、如此敎育纔能健全的發展、國家纔有堅實的某礎、現在大學畢業的靑年學生很多失業、這些靑年學生、都是受過社會國家長期敎養的人、但是他們都沒有機會為社會國家服務、這實在是最矛盾的一個現象、與國家社會最大的一個損失、今後我們要想補救、最好由中央或地方設法召集這一般失業的大學畢業生、加以必要的訓練、使能成為健全的中小學師資、與民衆的導師、担負各地方民政與敎育各方面的基本工作、這件事無論就靑年本身與社會國家各方面、都有無窮的利益、而且並不難做到、現在郵政局要招收郵務生、普通機關考錄事　月薪金不過一二十元、往往只有兩三名缺額、而有幾百人來應試、其中總有不少的大學畢業生、卽此可見一般生活之艱難、與失業學生之衆多、所以我們雖然沒有大量的經費、也不難訓練大批健全的師資、在明年度以內、我們的中小學敎育在量的方面、預期增多四分之一、我們現在就應該趕緊訓練好四分之一的中小學師資、準備補充、以後再逐年訓練師資、便可以逐年减少失業的大學生或中等學校的畢業生、而且可以逐年改良並普及我們的敎育、這伴事要如何纔能實施有效推行盡利、要請大家注意研究、第五、本席以為在民政方面最急要的事情有兩件、在消極方面要改良警政、在積極方面要舉辦地政、我們曉得天下無論什麼事物、凡是沒有益處的、便有害處、例如警察本來是用以維護公共安寗增進社會福利的、當然很重要很有益、但是現在我們中國的警察、便是無益而有害、我們如果到各地鄉區去實地考查一下、便知道現在許多地方的警察、不僅不能維護公安、增進福利、而且包烟包賭包娼、貧汚索詐、甚至串通匪賊欺壓良民、無惡不作、不僅偏僻地方的警察每每如此、就是通都大邑的警察、也不能盡免、各地的警察一方面積習如此之壞、一方面又以經費太少、所以要改良警察很不容易、所以我一向認為各地方經費不足的警察、對於人民旣絕對　無益而有害、最好能一律裁撤、而用保甲或團體來代替、各位從事地方行政工作很久、一定知道各地方團隊有團隊的毛病、保甲有保甲的毛病、十豪劣紳有士豪劣紳的毛病、而在各種病態當中、特別是警察的毛病格外多、今後究竟應當如何裁汰訓練、如何改革刷新、使能克盡警察的職責、希望大家要特別注意研究、這是民政工作在消極方面最要緊的一件事、至於積極方面就是要舉辦地政、以謀解决土地問題、大家要曉得土地問題是政治上一個根本問題、土地行政是政治上一種基本工作、如果士地行政不能舉辦完善、土地問題不得相當解决、政治建設不但不能成功、而且無法推進、大家不好以為舉辦地政、一定要先籌好幾多經費、然後可以進行、如果這樣、我們的地政一定什麼事都不能進行、永遠也不會辦好、所以務必以此為根本要政、籌集一部分最必要的經費、來竭力舉辦、此决會議的時候、大家耍將各省籌辦地政的情形報吿、互相參考、並且要作一個共同的决議、以為今後推進的張本、以上就是本席今天在開會的時候、向各位提出的幾點簡要的意思、希望大家就此數點、精心討論、此决十省高級行政人員聚首一堂、實在是很難得的機會、希望大家耍利用這個機會、儘量將各人的經騐和意見、貢獻出來、大家互相觀摩、互相研討、使本屆會議能得到最圓滿的效果、今後各地方的行政、能够得到最大的進步卽己盡到各位的職責、完成我們敎國救民的使命、（十日中央社電）</p>

<p>— 朗</p>
<p>隨着意大利軍隊的進佔阿國京城阿比西尼亞的命運固然卽將完結就是日內瓦的國際聯盟也已到了最後的生死關頭了自從去年十月三日意大利發動東菲的侵略戰爭後國際聯盟就宣判意國爲侵略者施以經濟的制裁自此五十餘國的對意經濟戰爭就接着意阿戰爭而爆發現在經過七個月的時間東菲戰爭已因阿國武器的窳劣而吿結束而國聯對意的經濟戰爭也因各會員國間陣綫的不齊沒有顯著的與迅速的成效在東菲戰爭結束後日內瓦的經濟戰爭是吾接着停出還是仍然繼續呢？要是停止了那不但表明意大利戰勝了日內瓦而國聯的命運也將跟着阿比西尼亞的失敗而完結要是仍然繼續下去的話則又爲那些抱着實利主義的國家所不願在這樣進退兩難的情形下國聯是已到了最後的生死關頭了</p>
<p>因爲日內瓦所遭遇的嚴重打擊現在各國政府都已在討論善後之策了有的主張改組國聯的組織刪除盟的第十條與第十六條的規定使其純然成爲一個調解國際糾紛的和平機關有的則仍主張繼續對意制裁以維持國聯的最後一口氣對於國聯的前途最爲關心的當然是英國政府因爲國聯的實施對意制裁大部是由於英國發動的力量所以現在制裁的失敗羅馬的戰勝了日內瓦實不啻表明意大利的戰勝英國英國對於國聯的善後問題在保守黨的政府方面多主張終止制裁改組國聯的機構首相包爾溫說：「英政府因鑒於意阿戰爭中集體行動的失敗必須淸理國聯的地位」外相艾登在六日下院外交政策辯論中也說：「國聯的行動旣未能於戰爭未作前阻止戰爭之發作亦不能於戰爭旣作後制止戰爭之進行國聯最多不過使戰爭較爲困難且代價較高而已……政府將以實事求是之精神與建設性質之政治手腕以應付所遇的困難」此外前外相張伯倫與上院議員樂相勛爵等也均主停止制裁與改組國聯而政府的反對黨議員如戴爾頓阿特里等則堅主繼續制裁南菲聯邦首相赫索格且主維持對意制裁延至數年之久以迫意國的讓步此外北歐瑞典丹麥挪威荷蘭等國代表則於九日集會一致主張靜觀英法兩國的態度倘不能獲得任何眞正具體的結果則彼等將考慮根據公理原則另糾新國聯的建議預料今日開會的行政院雖將討論到意阿問題但終止制裁决議的通過常然還非其時不過國聯的存亡在最近的將來總耍所有决定了</p>
<p>近牛以來因爲侵略的帝國主義者之先後退出日內瓦國聯已經比較地成爲一個維持國際和平的機關這决的遭遇實由於英法等大國沒有眞正擁護集體制度的誠意所致有許多人因爲國聯的不能切實帮助阿國而就痛恨國聯其實國聯不是一個太上政府它本身是沒有什麼力量的它的力量全建築於會員國的身上允其是愛好和平民衆的身上當此侵略者得意忘形與火藥氣充滿全世界的時候集體安全制度的建立是非常急需的而國聯的組織尚不失爲集體安全制度中的一個重要因素所以實有繼續存在的必要然而國聯現已到了最後的生死關頭了怎樣去維持它的生命充實它的力量實是愛好和平的民衆所需考慮解决的問題</p>

<p>（羅馬）意相墨索里尼今夜於敎堂鐘聲鏗鏗各處汽笛聲嗚之中、在威尼齊亞宮對二十萬民衆宣布以阿比西尼亞加入意國版圖、墨氏演詞之際、民衆興奮欲在、幾無一句不為歡呼之聲所隔斷、墨氏謂今已以正式命令將阿比西尼亞帝國置於意大利充分與完全主權之下、意王伊瑪呂爾已加阿比西尼亞帝號、阿比西尼亞將由一總督統治、伊利特里與索瑪里倫知事均歸其節制、墨氏繼於歡呼如雷之聲中宣布將以在東菲奏凱之巴杜格略上將任阿比西尼亞總督、</p>
<p>墨氏演說中有言日、意大利卒吿成其帝國矣、此為具有羅馬標章不可毀滅的决心與權力表徵之法西斯帝國、此並為和平帝國、蓋意大利願自己與其餘諸國悉處和平中、惟任何國欲以武力反對吾人者、吾人必拒之以自衛、意大利靑年之一代、慘淡經營十有四年、卽以此帝國為目的、此為羅馬之傳統、蓋羅馬於戰勝之後、輒與戰敗之民族合而為一、共存共榮、此使意大利歷史上之一時代吿一結束、而開啟趨向前途可能性之偉大門戶、以入一新時代、爾等其能勝任乎、墨氏於羣衆大呼表示能勝任後、復曰、此呼聲不啻為在上帝與人類前偉大之誓言而生死不渝者、</p>
<p>墨氏演說中並無一言述及國聯及與阿比西尼亞有關係之各國、此節殊堪注意、衆料國聯意代表阿洛錫將在星期一日國聯行政院會議中拒絕討論阿比西尼亞問題、否認阿代表摩里安有為新帝「臣民」之權利、並將要求渠（阿洛錫）為阿比西尼亞之惟一代表、</p>

<p>— 荘舉本</p>
<p>（三）羣科灘蒙　羣科灘蒙</p>
<p>我們從兩力克景勒處、知道在羣科灘駐牧的有八個蒙　、以　數的密度以較永安柴達木等任何地方爲多、可以說是青海蒙　的　集地、現把八個蒙　都記在下面、</p>
<p>一、綽羅斯部南右翼頭　爾力克·貝勒、郡王的名字林沁旺濟勒、</p>
<p>二、綽羅期部北中　哈爾格貝子、郡王的名字札什安木濟勒、</p>
<p>三、和碩特部北右翼　宗貝子、郗王的名字索南木安得海、</p>
<p>四、和碩特部南右翼後　托毛公、鎮國公的名字索南木　排勒、</p>
<p>五、和碩特南左翼後　阿喀公、鎮國的名字拉布旦、</p>
<p>六、和碩特部南左翼羣科　薩克、輔國公的名字丹增、</p>
<p>七、和碩特部東上　巴汗綽爾札薩克、輔國公的名字勒多日、</p>
<p>八、獨立部察罕詰們汗（白佛）札薩克大喇嘛的名字　歲克　代、</p>
<p>郡王·鎮國公·輔國·公札薩克大喇嘛、都　清朝封他們的爵位、各　王公所轄的百姓、都不過幾百個帳房、或幾　個帳房、所以勢力很小、最小的一　巴汗綽爾札薩克、據設祇有二家百姓、這　王云已經有名無實了、</p>
<p>羣科灘地地勢</p>
<p>二十四日那天風雲不停、早上我們在賬房門口看婦女們擠牛乳、寒冷的風雪擊在面上、使我們發愁、今天打算到羣科　薩克的牧聲上去參觀、但是聽說王爺已在前幾天到大通的廣惠寺去了、現在我們祇有改道到察罕諾們汗去、考察獨立部的狀祝、十時左右、爾力克買勒派了鳥拉送我們出發、　着風雪西行、手足都凍得優痛、</p>
<p>十五里的行程　過了一條八公尺闊的　水、水已經結了厚水、此地顧出　水很窄、將　其源了、河道迂緩曲折、直向草山中仲展過去、一個紅岩的山角、又把牠份成北西二條支流、</p>
<p>灘上的地勢開期平緩、兩邊的山　都是不很傾斜的黃土層、沿着　地去、有剛站路的深度、直達到北首的　游、東邊接連大通、四邊臨蒲青海、面積也有幾百方里、高度都在拔海三千公尺以上、地勢愈往上去、高度也漸增加、沿途有幾個　　落落的帳房、大隊的牛羊不避風雪的在吃黃草、現在我們登上那個紅岩的山角、又跨　西邊的一條　水支流　風雪慢慢的止了、</p>
<p>我們由嚮導　領在西邊一個土房連接的村落中、此地就是白佛的家裹、一個高大土房中的主人迎接我們進去、室中煨的羊　爐子、非常溫暖、</p>
<p>蒙　的番族</p>
<p>在此地值得我們奇怪的他們的語言都用番話、當初我還以爲他們鄰近「剛咱」番族、所以能講番話、後來我向他們問、「你們是那一族人」、而他們的答復、「我們是Wu——番人」、</p>
<p>來之先、我雖已知道察罕諾們汗是一個獨立　、沒有王公而有　薩克活佛統治、活佛是藏人而不是蒙人、所以他們是特殊的部落、但是經現在向各方調查的結果、證明他們非但統治有　薩克喇嘛是藏族、而被統治者百姓也都是藏族、青海的蒙人共有六部二十九　、現在察罕諾們汗是一個名實不相符的蒙　、所以真正的蒙人祇有五部二十八　、但是他們藏族而蒙　的特殊狀態、引起了我們歷史的興趣、</p>
<p>他們是文化落後、沒有歷史的民族、所以要知道他們歷史的演進、很困難、後來在幾個老者之前、得到後面的一小段傳說、</p>
<p>察罕諾們汗、白佛、在古時由西藏派來、青海傳教、蒙人很信仰宗教、所以他常駐有蒙人的部落裹、清朝年羹堯平西後、編蒙人爲　、就將他鞠在蒙　中、統轄番人成爲獨立部、誥封札薩克大喇嘛、以後我在西寗青海南部警備司令都、得到一段較有考據的材料、</p>
<p>清順治時、西藏大喇嘛齊遇嘉木錯來青、　　　教、番眾服從爲七世呼畢動汗、康熙四十四年（一七〇五）第八世羅　嘉木錯入觀、詔封察諾們、汗雍正三年授　薩克、察罕諾汗們蒙　也、漢之　意曰「白法王」、</p>
<p>羊子的悶死</p>
<p>此在是白佛的一個管家的家庭、白佛還很幼　、今年　十歲、正在離此很遠的一所喇嘛寺中讀經、他在這裏　有一千　羊、三百條牛、八十匹馬、家產很不小、我們無聊的在荘上閑逛、他們房屋全是立體的平房、建築材料祇有衫木和黃土、所以屋頂牆壁多是泥土構成、</p>
<p>荘上也有農田、他們的生活是半耕半牧的、普通一家都種有五六斗田、養幾十個羊、荘稼祇出　稞·燕麥·菜子·三種、因爲地勢很高、已在三〇八〇公尺、陰歷七月結冰、三月開凍、夏季多冰雹、去年遭遇雹災很重、所以荘稼歉收、過去此地全部是牧場、自民國八年後纔開墾、</p>
<p>氣候很冷、午後二時有淡淡的陽光、寒暑表還停留在零下五度、飲食完令　粑牛羊肉、我們也得到盤羊肉、一盒　粑的招待、</p>
<p>我們初來、管家的宰一個羊子招待、一個年輕的喇嘛他在羊圈中帶到了一個肥羊牽在屋　底下、把四個足　在一起推　地上、再用一根毛繩把羊嘴上緊緊的緾了幾轉、使他不能透氣、羊子倒在地上掙扎、喇嘛用力的按住不使牠動彈、一刻鐘以後、羊子的肚子膨脹了、眼珠突山了、喇嘛發現牠已悶死、然後纔開刀剝皮、慈悲的喇嘛、爲吃的問題也殘酷了、羊子的身上充滿紫紅的熱血、因爲番人喜歡吃血水肉、（以肉中帶血爲味美）、所以羊子多受到這樣慘酷的死法、</p>
<p>荘上有十幾家土房、烟戶不多、但附近的帳房參是察罕諾們汗的百姓、</p>
<p>社交真自由</p>
<p>我們在荘上一共住了兩夜、附近的番人都來探看、這裏的番人沒有什麼別織的裝束、祇有女子、她們也常戴蒙古式的尖頂帽子、但是上面沒有紅綫　頭、富有的婦女背上掛着狠多如碗大的銀飾、通常用十二個、四個一排　在三條闊的帶上、下面垂一行紅鬚頭、上面又是七個較小的銀飾或銀牌、直連到她們頭頂中的幾根辮梢上、銀飾多刻有美麗的花紋、中間嵌一粒紅色珊瑚、很像一雙紅結子瓜皮帽、她們道樣美麗的裝東有數斤軍，會使她們頭部感覺到沉屋、所以她們又用一要皮　連着裝飾、束在胸前、減輕頭部的負担、頭上週圍的小辮共有幾十根、分披在兩肩、和一般番女相此地的番女都能歌舞、我們初就在商人的帳房中沽一塊錢酒請她們歌唱、她們唱的時候兩人對立、舉袖而歌聲調清脆、但多歌少舞、舞的動作很簡單、祇有舉袖磚身、也流行歌舞侑酒、有客人來她們唱一雙曲、敬·碗酒、或許男女在會中兩情相契、也亙相唱歌敬酒、以示纏綿、</p>
<p>女子幾天頭自由戀愛、在番人中間很平常、此地結婚的規矩、新女過門一日、即返娘家、直到生　子　纔正式過門，如果子女生得晚、陋了幾年、那就通融、或者夫婦的感情不台、也就道樣一去而不來、過門時的新婦、有二個女嬪扶住她兩腋、走人男家的大門、新婦低頭用袖子遮蓋而部、表示她的羞縮的狀態、</p>
<p>她們的社交真自由、今天管家的來了一個戴狐皮帽的新客人、晚上一個漂亮的番女—傭人—就陪他在灶房中睡覺，這是一個羊把勢（收羊真子）很氣憤的向警察訴說、</p>

<p>— 李惠堂</p>
<p>五月二日的下午四時、法郵、亞林美斯一號蠕蠕出動、向吳淞口南航了、我們一班隊友們、　一個不唏一口安樂愉快大氣、表現着舒適的快感、這並不是我們厭惡上海、以早早離開為妙、不不過、我們對球事和球空氣委實有點厭倦了、快些離開了到海上去吸點新空氣自然是欣悅不過的一回事、半月前、世運足球預選在香江舉行、同時我們港中球隊為着趕淸結束常年比賽、於是便球賽連疊、每星期賽上四五决、選拔有了結果後、我們的精神巳萎靡不堪、我們的肌肉已疲乏萬分、我們的興味已冷到零點、我們眞存着「見球生厭」的心理了、接着奉全國體協會的命到上海來作表演賽、惟覺身倦神疲、但協會之召又何敢辭、</p>
<p>以困憊之師、跑到上海而應新覊之馬、我們雖則自信確已各盡人事、努　到極點、俱我們自知在這環境之下是斷沒有把我們的十足眞本領拿出來的可能件、眞的、這幾决的比賽中、誰都沒有精彩的表演、這失常的顯露、是我們本身所預料得到的、因此、我們統希望愛好的人們對我們這回的不滿意處、不可加以苛責、</p>
<p>最不幸的便是四月二十八日那天、我們十一雙毛腿太不爭氣、不能把西聯隊打敗、累到那盈千累萬的「愛之彌殷望之彌切」的球迷們、個個都掃與歸家這是我們這回上海行引為最大的憾事、其實、球賽勝敗、最難逆料、我經騐所得、英倫的一等球隊、常會負於三等球隊、又何况西聯的戰鬥力、和我們實無甚高下相夫不遠呢、優勝劣敗、雖則是天演公例、但一二次的球賽是說不定的、除非是兩隊賽上十次八次、幸運之神才不容易播弄作怪、才證得出誰優誰劣、</p>
<p>為了這一次的敗績、便引起了滿城風雨、報章上的批評、球迷們的疵議、論調紛紜、給予我們一番大敎訓、給予我們一番深刻的印象、這不得不說是這回失敗的厚賜、我常感覺到我國無論報界或球迷們的批評是時存偏見或有不適當的地方、他們對「勝負」兩個字、委實看得太重要了、勝球時無論表演得怎麼劣也必全隊博得好評、說個天花亂墜、負球時則適得其反、全不考究失敗之原由、全不體諒失敗的苦衷、其實同時方趾圓顧、同有血氣、到了場誰不想表演盡力、我們有切身利害的、誰甘心自暴自棄、不過有時「馬不進也非敢後也」、為着特殊的原因、方表演不滿人意而已、關於這回的評議、我想借這裹的篇幅把眞相稍為大略的說明、</p>
<p>某報紙說我「罰十二碼球時、彈柱後竟不明規則、再加一脚、」這才算寃枉得狠、我如果連這顯淺的規則也不懂、則我又有什麼資格做隊長和裁判員、事實上是那球兒從柱彈回太急、叫我廻避不來、因以觸着犯規而己、我何嘗有再加一脚的蓄意、這種記載是失實、是記者的智識膚淺的證明、於體育進展是有妨碍、</p>
<p>還有一位素昧平的「老何君」投報向我殷切的指示啟迪、我生平最歡迎人們對我的忠吿、不過他所說的也有辯釋的必耍、他說上半時中衛綫表演不佳、下半時為隊長者竟視若無覩、不調換他人、其實那天是賽英國例、不許換人的、這是他不明眞相、白費議論之處、他又說「老將曹桂成李國威不能再用」、曹李兩人是日表演、的確失常、但球員誰也有失常的日子、又焉能以一二回比賽觀的察來評定優劣、來作肯定的决斷、况且「老將」三字、用在曹桂居還有可言、李國威今年才二十三、難道也算老去麼、國威在港表演平均頗佳、中西報均認為最佳之左中衛、「今後不宜再用」這句話、恐怕言之失當吧總之、我上面會說過、這回各人都感覺得太疲乏、興趣不濃厚、每决的比審雖則並沒仔放棄食任的心、但也不過從勉强支待精神萎頽中努力而已、在這種情形之下來作定論是最不公允的、還有素來攻擊我的「××週報竟把道决的失敗令諉過於我個人身上加上其他種種的貶議、說我已老而沒用、不應入選、應有盡有、攻訐到不遺餘力、我和他們有麼不共載天的仇恨、我也莫名其妙、好在這一類的烏報、也不過是博得下流社會的同情踢、是沒有甚麼價値的其實、十二碼、踢不進、不一定便會影響到勝負最終的局面、而　十二碼不進便司空慣見的一回事、不値得大駕小怪的、全球上最佳的射手也時有失脚、何况我們程度較低的輩子、至於老」和「退化」、我非超人、這遲早必來的事我又焉能像冗、是祇可憐他們儘命賣氣力地攻擊也臺不收效、協會充耳不聞遼把隊長的責任放到我肩膊上來、是則我又何嘗太老、何嘗太沒中用、極還記得在港最後的表演賽我還托福射入五球、獲得報章和迷民們標好的批評、今日相距不過半月而已、退化斷不會來麼得這快、我堅持着我本人的自信心、說我還未太老還非全不中用、</p>
<p>這篇文字、如果我非患病的話、早就要發表給大衆以事實的眞相的我並無非存心洩忿或代表隊　們辯護、其實我們把心血精神氣力都出盡了便問心無愧、人家的論是論非和球賽的勝敗、我們又焉管得許多、我們這决旬日的上海居留、所得的印象是上海的人們也和他處的同胞懷着一樣的心理、這心理是甚麼、這便是「球賽勝敗、愛惡隨之」、把「勝」字看得太偏重、因此、我們對我們球賽失敗了絕對並不悲觀、我們看見報章批評和聽見人們議的論不適當、和球迷們擁護的不符正義、才感覺到我國體育前途的無望、</p>

<p>— 胡祖蔭</p>
<p>該校訓育的中心是在培養民族精神。培養民族精神的第一步是在實施國民性的敎學，就是說，在語言，文學，歷史，地理各科中儘量採用本國國民所需要的材料。同時，該校常將本國民族的發展和成功提示兒童，使兒童在潛移默化中養成高尙的民族精神。例如，此决德國宣佈廢棄　卡路公約，派兵駐紮在萊茵非武裝區。該校史地敎師乃將關於萊茵河及附近　方的地理，風俗，人情等項用幻燈放射給兒童看，使這些身在異國的兒童亦能明曉祖國的情况，可使地們的愛國心油然而生。</p>
<p>還有一種方法該校用以培養民族精神的就是鍛鍊兒童的體格。健全的體格乃是民族精神的基礎。該校雖無完美的體育館設備，但是對於鍜鍊兒童的體格卻是積極地進行。校中平時每日上午課五節，自八時半起至十二時半止。午后各級均無正式的功課，但是各級學生均須輪流來校參加健身運動。各級男生每星期午后輪流來校三次鍛鍊體格：女生亦須同樣地來校，但是有一二次的健身運動是改為針綫的工作。其他團體的健身運動，如運動會，遠足，登山等也是常常舉行的。</p>
<p>六、希特勒青年團</p>
<p>德國的青年訓練在過去歷史上頗負盛名。自希特勒秉政以來、青年訓練的工作更是積極地進行。希特勒現在已將全國的靑年訓練工作集中在政府的指導之下，為國家訓練未釆的公民。希特勒靑年團乃是德國靑年訓練中的一種方式。上海德國學校亦有希特勒靑年團的組織。關於希特勒靑年團的編制　活動現在簡單地介紹一下。</p>
<p>希特勒靑年團可以根據兒童的年齡分為兩組：第一組是幼童隊，由十歲至十四歲的兒童加入；第二組是靑年隊，由十五歲至十八歲的靑年加入。在女子方面，亦有相似的兩隊。第一隊是少女隊，由十歲至十四歲的女童加入；第一隊是聯邦德意志女子隊，由十五歲至二十一歲的女子加入。團的編制是如此：的有十五入稱一小隊，五十人稱一中隊，一百五十人稱一大隊，六百人稱一區分隊，滿若干區分隊可成一區隊，滿若干區隊可成一團。德國現有希特勒靑年團二十五團；每團團員人數男人約有七萬五千人，女子亦有相等的人數。上海德國學校的靑年團也是直接屬於希勒特指揮的。該團的團旗，制服等均由希特勒規定。</p>
<p>希特勒育年團訓練的目的是在養成健全的體恪與盡職的觀念。因此靑年團的訓練包括健身運動，拳術，射擊，野外露營，偵察測嚴，遠足登山等。同特對於精神的訓練也　非常的注意。德國男女學生加人希特勒靑年團是自動的，並不是勉强的。但是一經加入以後，必須接受嚴密的訓練。去年夏天，希特勒曾在德國召集國內外的靑年團，舉行集中的訓練；上海德國學校的靑年團亦會派代表同國參加。（完）</p>

<p>— （亢遯）</p>
<p>亞比西尼亞有個流行民間的故事：</p>
<p>有一天，一雙豹有事出外，留着豹子在洞裏，一隻象闖入豹窟，把豹子殺害了，膏了它的饞吻。豹子的鄰居走去報吿：</p>
<p>「你的愛子殺死了。」</p>
<p>「是誰殺死它的？」</p>
<p>「給象殺死的。」</p>
<p>「啊！象？象不會殺害我的見子。這定是給那可惡的山羊害死的。」</p>
<p>「不，確是象、」</p>
<p>「我告訴你，殺我的兒子的定是那山羊，不是別的。」說完了，它縱身一跳，把山羊吞噬，以　殺子之恨。</p>
<p>原來那豹明知它的兒子是給象殺死的；只是因為自己氣力不是巨象的對手，祇好借山羊來出氣。這便是「山羊之過」（It　is　thefoultof　the　goats）的成語的來原。</p>
<p>目下的阿比西尼亞已是戰敗了。但他們這次并不會为了惧怕那巨象而埋怨山羊。他們畢竟與巨象作了殊死的奮鬥，雖敗猶榮的。</p>

<p>國器對於這件事非常的抱歉，覺得讓人家來消坐了一會，連熱茶全沒有喝一杯，這還罷了。出門的時候，還讓人家濺了一身泥水。無論如何，明天得到人家去回拜一次，天晴也好，下雨也好，這個的是不可失的。他心裹有了這個主意，看看對面屋子裹，母親已經安歇，也就息燈睡覺，預備明日早上趕着把功課趕完，早點下課，好去會平山。當他早上醒了過來，料着還是陰雨天，在被裏還是很遲鈍的起身，可是翻身坐起，睜眼就看到玻璃窗上一片金黃的日光。過去許多天的沉悶，就在這樣睜開眼來的時候，完全消失。自己漱洗了一陣，喝了茶吿別母親，忽忽走出門去。這緊隔壁，是人家一所菜園子，兩面是土墻，一面是籬笆，地上種了許多菜蔬，在靠籬笆一帶，種了百十來根細竹子，那竹　被雨水浸淋之後，晴朗的太陽一照，格外現着靑翠，也不知道是什麼小烏，七八上十個，在竹枝上飛着叫着。那菜地裏的菜棵，零零落落的抽出幾寸茶心　，上面頂着零碎的小黃花兒。就是這麼一些點綴，這初春給與人的印象，也就很深了。這條路原是國器日日經過的，平常不感到有什麼欣喜之處，現在在融和的春光裏照着，這就覺得是非常之悅目。允其是那竹子梢上吹過來的東南風彿到人臉上，一點也不冷。這就籤自己胸樣裏的空氣，也是很舒暢的呼吸着。南京城雖是那麼偉大，可是在這個日子，城北完全是竹林子和菜地麥田。城南人家儘管稠密，但是那水塘和菜園子，也隨處皆是。國器所住的地方是門西，這裏長的大街小巷，完全是那古老式的建築，沒有檐的屋瓦，蓋在低矮而石灰剝落的墻上。在三兩處人家中間，總是夾着兩三畦菜地，或者一業野竹子。窄小的巷子，地面上鋪着鵝卵石，雜亂不成紋理。在鵝卵石的縫裏，或者人家墻脚下，伸出那一業的野草葉子，或者一圈靑苔。巷子裏是很少行人，除非是那在野塘裏洗衣服的女人，提了洗衣籃子經過。或者挑籮　的小販，挑了一担綠油油的菜，很快的過去。行人少，人聲也很沉寂的，倒是織緞子的機房，吱咯吱咯，在睛空裏，把織機聲送了過來。國器想到小樓一夜聽春雨，深巷明朝賣杏花的詩句，心裏揣想着，假使這時候有個賣花的人，由這裏經過，不問是什麼花罷，那倒是很富於詩意的。（一九）</p>

<p>— 霞飛</p>
<p>是一個暮春的黃昏，密密的雨絲在無聲地　着，　着。大都會已像死了一般，一切實　都已暫時安息了。</p>
<p>室內的週遭是靜寂的，那陰濕的空氣壓迫着，使我呼吸一下都會感到困難；我隨便地抽出一本賽來閱看，但沒有讀上半頁就把它撩在一邊了。走到窗口，將那扇玻璃窗子推開了，打算伸頭到窗外去望望細雨下的街頭，但風吹在身上，雨飄在臉上，一縷陰凄寒顫之感直像一條褐色小蛇似的爬進了心頭。</p>
<p>現在雖然已經是慕春時候了，可是那氣候却老是滯留在一個初春的季節裹，那麼陰寒的，使人不容易感到道就是春光明媚的開花時節。</p>
<p>打上窗子，回進來將一個沉重的肢體投入了一隻躺椅裏，一種無名的哀愁，把我的心緊緊地抓住着，感覺到人生的虛無飄渺，感覺到人間世的一切，無謂，多餘。……</p>
<p>當我正在默默地追溯過去，咀嚼現在，和憧憬未來的時候，一種幽怨鳴　的音調，從遠處的街頭飄過來，一聲聲，一節節的，鑽進了我的耳朶裏，使我的神經敏銳地激起了一陣高潮，覺得那顫抖的聲調裹，在訴說着人生的凄苦。聲昔漸漸地由遠而近，愈淸晰了；於是我站起來推開了窗子，伏在窗檻上聽，使我忘記了寒冷，忘記了風雨之夜。只聽着那凄絕的，悲愴的調子，像空谷猿鳴，像嫠婦低泣地送過來，我從那每一僩曳長而顫動的尾音裏，彷彿看見了一個臺鬱的老人，在慘淡的街燈下站着，或　　在陰暗的街頭和衡裏，像個幽靈似的，拖着一條寂寞的影子，想把那無限幽怨，悲傷，屈辱，憤怒……都　這根單弦訴說出來。</p>
<p>那聲音過去了，漸漸地由近而遠，甚至消失在那風雨的黑夜裏：於是，我才失望地抬起頭來望望這靜穆的街頭，只見那幽黯的路燈照着這寬平的馬路，這些建築物在地上縱橫地賽着許多影子，給那昏黃的色調襯托得好像是經過了一决暴風雨一樣。</p>
<p>回到裏面，纔發現自已的衣服上，頭髮上全給淋濕了。</p>
<p>這夜躺在床上，反覆地不能入眠，雖然將頭深深地埋在被窩裏面，並且摒絕了一切思慮，以冀使神經安靜起來。但是不行，——那幽怨嗚咽的音調，那瘦創焦黃的臉龐，儘在我腦子裏旋廻着，幻現着。一縷悲愴蒼凉的感覺也不住地在我心裏爬動，它像一條毒蛇，將我這顆歷經滄桑，屢受創傷的心靈　着，　得發痛</p>
<p>我整整地一夜沒有闔眼，只是眼睜睜地瞪着天花板，搜素一些不相干的往事，一直到玻璃窗上透着白光時。</p>
<p>自從道一晚起，我就每晚聽到那凄絕的，悲凉的調子，在我耳邊盪漾着，而我也就從這一晚起，開始患着了沉重的失眠症。</p>

<p>— 予敻</p>
<p>戰時我們的金融怎樣？應該有看怎樣一種　施，這在目前已成為不得不考慮的問題。遭裏擬簡單的討論一個綱領。</p>
<p>戰事發生之後，金融市塲將發生何種影　？簡言之，就是國際的和國內的信用的　　破壞。吾人問題，就在如何應和這種國內外信用破壞後的局面，戰事發生後，第一感受影響的必是外匯和證券市場，戰機一現，國外資金必大規模退出我國。外人財產，不問其為股票債券地產或其他投資，必設法變價提回。外國銀行方面，必將其活動資產運回本國，至其所有的股票債券及貼現票據，或則傾出市場，或則直接轉向國成家銀行貼現外匯。外人資金的移動，成為壓近我國外滙和證券市　的市塲的第一層重力。國內方面，必有一部分資金擬乘機逃出，商人售出證券，提取存欵，轉向國家銀行購買外滙，內國資金的逃避，成為壓迫外匯和證券市塲的第二層重力。在此情形之下，證券市塲，必先起嚴重風潮，而銀行方面，放欵不能即行收回，無以應付顧客提存，必相率擱淺；錢業因銀行緊縮信用，追回放欵，無處周轉，　將接續倒閉；國家銀行，亦逢非常危機，蓋外人財產旣擬進行變價提回，國內資金亦有一部擬乘機逃出，外人財產一轉瞬而　至三行，購取外匯，人民自銀行提得存欵，　踵亦至三行換易外滙，三行穏定外滙力量，必逢非常試騐。在現行幣制之下。——外滙本位，爭購外滙，事實上與一般所謂銀行擠兌無異，外酒準備，轉瞬可以吿罄。信用恐慌，便成不可收拾。如何鎭壓風潮，關　就在這一點。</p>
<p>此時的問題，一在避免金融市塲的擾亂，二在保障信用機構的　整，三在保存外滙凖備。應急的辦法，其一，為　免金融市塲的擾亂，唯有命令交易所即行停市；其二，為保障信用機構的完整，唯有命令銀行及一切銀錢機關暫停支付；期三，為保存外滙凖備，唯有暫時施行外滙封鎖。這三點就是應付戰時金融的第一步。交易所停市，為證券　價　起重大變動的心然結果，此或不經政府命令，而已先被迫停市。然交易所交易以政府債券為大家，政府信用直接由交易表現。倘任交易所自行被迫停市，政府信用，不質於人民心目中先留一不良印象。是以政府應及　　置，逆料不能毫的周面即精聞　時，寗可先期令其停市，母特局面已成不可收拾而後以不得已的手叚出之。至宣布停止支付，目的在保障信用機構的完整，不應臨機應變，勿待銀錢業憶相繼顚仆，市塲已經窒塞而後施行。目此　問題，與保存外匯凖備亦有甚大關係。蓋任人民自由提存，則人民自普通銀行存欵之後，立鄧轉向中央銀行購取外匯，或竟以各行存單支摺向三行貼現外匯，　無異以各行存欵强迫三行以外匯支有，外匯的員失益速。是以　布停止支付，亦為保存外匯凖備的　種手叚。至封鎖外匯，事實上與停止兌無異。在現行幣制之下，人民雖不能以法幣向銀行兌現，但可按法佈兌取外匯，且依法幣原定，三行負無限制供給的責任，倘任中外人民自由購買外匯，以外人在華資產的龐大與國人自信心薄弱，外匯凖備旋踵可以全部損失，是以戰機出現之後立即施行外匯封鎖，為絕對必要。縣此舉亦可以間接制止普通銀行的提存風潮。鹽外匯不通，提得存欵之後，不能購買外匯，而所提者悉為法幣，並非現貨，不能用以藏匿，提　風潮，自可間接受到影響而稍殺其勢。</p>
<p>上述一種手叚，僅在消極的制裁紊亂的局面，猶之以重力鎭在波動的水面，使具內部得以澄清。然交易所停市，債權務停止支付，外匯施行封鎖，其結果必為經濟活動的靜止。戰時正最發揮國力以爭生存的時候，經濟活動靜止，為絕對不良現象。蓋經濟活動靜止，國力勢將無從發揮。是以更進一步的工作，就在施行積極的政策，以推動停頓的經濟機構，這就是吾人史進一步的工作。</p>
<p>更進一步的工作，可分成五方面言之：其一，政府應以實力支持撑信用機構。使其恢復活動；其二，政府應以全力支持工商業，使其能適應戰時的非常環境。其三，政府應以新增的信用，救濟戰時普通信用手叚失去後通貨緊縮局面；其四，政府應全力制裁擾亂法幣流通的因子，保障法幣流通。其五，實行國外債權動員，維持外匯　定·茲分別討論如次。</p>
<p>銀行旣已奪令停止支付在先，所有債務均行攔置，　　愈久，則待給的帳面債務愈多，而在此種恐慌與緊縮的局面之下，　欵　難順利收回，倘非政府擴大信用，直接　以援助，則銀行將長無開門之日。　業界方面，平素原無充分準備經濟周縛，惟藉同業信用及銀行的短期拆欵，銀行旣　緊　於上，同業又彼此　相警戒，此種信用調動的方法，不復存在，其不能　門復業，可以待言。銀行錢莊，為經濟活動的樞紐，不能恢復活動，則經濟上殭結的局面，即無鬆解之望。　以在停止支付期中。政府應即進行實力援助各行及錢業。其辦法可分二點啻之；第一，政府可信照歐戰時英國的方法，假手中交三行，直接　欵各銀行，以各能應付其即期債務為目的。此舉在使各行能如其完結債務，恢復營業。第二，中交三行憑凖備充足基金，辦事各種商業票據的貼現及再貼現。此舉目的，昨使一般普通銀行及錢業界因停止支付而凍結的資金。有活動餘地。蓋停止支付之後，各家收存票據，無形凍結，倘中交三行能以實力吸收此類票據，代以本身信用，則凍結的債務能繼續周轉　通，活動資金增加，對於　動市面與完結債務，自有甚大帮助。英國戰時，亦以此為重要手叚之一。政府直接墊欵各銀行，銀行票據的凍結資金，又能因三行的盡量客納貼現而恢復融通，銀行活動機能，自可逐漸恢復。</p>
<p>其次，政府應支撐工商業的活動。此點蓋甚重要，蓋戰時工商業為物資取給的來源，一切經濟設施，均應以使工商業能允分發揮效能為目的，工商業的活動，在乎資金，若干事業，固　由政府出資經營，私人企業，仍屬重要。關於私人企　的運動資金問題，吾人主張政府應仿照歐戰時英國的辦法，對銀錢界的工商　欵，由政府直接擔保。蓋戰時政局不定，銀錢業縱有　足資金，恐不敢盡量貨放，此殆為事實所不能免。倘政府能直接予以信用上的擔保，使銀錢界放出資金，無凍結之危險，則銀行資金，自可直接運用於援助生產之途，此舉蓋亦在使政府對於金融界的信用援助，能推其效果以達於工商業。　然者則政府雖救濟銀錢業，銀錢業則不敢救濟工商業，政府對銀錢業的信用援助，將無　義可言。為使銀錢業能　分運用政府所給與的信用以支撐工商業界，則政府對於產業界信用擔保，為絕對必要。</p>
<p>第三，政府應準備以新增信用，救濟戰事起　籌碼缺乏的局面。此點有我國亦甚重要。蓋我國通組織。原甚愎雜，法幣政策施行後，現貨法令上雖已不能流通，但仍有一部分散存民間，若干地方，有實値的　幣仍占勢力。一且信用風潮發生，銀幣固將全被藏匿，即一般銅元　輔，亦將避不見世，逆　目將有一部分奸商輸通幣往內地收買銅元及有實値　幣。民十六年武漢集中現金時的事實，可為借鏡。有實値的貨幣瞬被蒞匿，籌碼缺乏，交易阻帶，若干地方，且將變成死市。以新增信用，謀市面安定，為絕對必要。歐戰時英法德　國，於戰事初起時無不大量發出小額票幣，目的所在，無非在便上市面融通，避免經濟週轉的殭結。此點當為吾人所取法。且戰事發生，經濟活動勢將側　內　，在內地一帶，小額信用籌碼，應付此種非常的局面，尤為必要。</p>
<p>第四，制裁　亂法幣價値的因子，保障法幣流通。此點在我國亦特重要。此地可以討論之　有」：第一現幣的秘密流通問題。我國現貨尚未完全集申，一旦戰事發生，初則藏匿，絕跡市場，雖鋼元亦不能兌；繼則出現於暗盤市場，成為破壞法幣流通嚴有力的因子。蓋民間現貨，不能長義死藏，經相當時日之後，必現出現於市場，暗盤交易，由是而起。南北戰爭進的美國，歐戰時的歐洲，均有同類經騐。信用制度發達，如英國，對銀幣秘密流通，亦不能不明令禁止。即民十六武漢集中現金後現幣出現於暗盤市場的擾亂物價及害法幣流通，尤為吾人現身的經騐。是以防　現皆及有實値的貨幣出現於暗盤市場，為鞏固法幣流通必採的手段。其次，外滙的用為支付手段問題。歐戰　各國背幣恐慌期中，以外滙　　手　，成商場風氣。結果外滙因需要　增而飛漲，本國紙幣因無用途而成　物。民國十六年武漢集中現金的　期，商人競以申滙申鈔為支付工具，結果便申滙於短期內狂騰至六千兩以上，武革認為準幣　中交三行鈔，於短期內跌至不能流通。這種歷史事實，深候吾　注意。禁止外滙作為支付手段，殆為鞏固法幣流通必採的方法。</p>
<p>第五，集中債權，維持外滙穏定。此點至為重要，赤至困難。前旣施行外滙封鎖，然外滙不能長期鎖閉，終必徐　開放，開放之　　何維持穏定，　是吾人的問題。歐戰時各國為應　外滙，曾先後施行國外債權動員，初則由國家組行設法收買，繼則課以特稅，迫人民自動交出，最後則雷　風行，對一切國外　權，强迫集中，由政府在國外出賣。强迫集中國外債權，殆為吾人絕對必採的手段。蓋就我國人民的效　程度，非以强制手段施行，人民决不願自動獻出。然戰時要以一國之力，穏定外滙，殆至困難，重要之點尤在取得國外的合作，惟强制集中國外債權，仍為吾人應採的斷然手段之一。</p>
<p>上面五點的主要目的，消極方面在制裁擾亂的因子，積極方面，在以政府的力量，支撐信用機構的活動，以達戰時發揮國力的目的，而主要之點，尤在於後者，此外問題多尚多，此地所述，不過其大要者而已。最後，吾人且再一論黨前應做的準備工作問題。</p>
<p>吾人所要提出之點有三：其一，民間現貨，仍應從速集中；其二，通貨的；其二，通貨的供給來源，仍應速求統一；其三，金融機構，仍應從速應行調整。　　　未能完全集中，殆不容諱言，一日戰事發生之後，存留民間的　貨，逆料即將成為擾亂市塲的有力因子。為使暗盤交易不至發　，物價不致擾亂計，現貨集中為絕對必要。其次，貨幣供給來源的統一，殆即發行集中之意。現在市　的紙幣，仍甚複雜，地方銀行鈔票，在內　尤點地位·一旦戰事發生，因人民心理作用之故，市價難免發生參差，物價將因之感受擾亂。為使此種　幣價參差而致紊亂的局面不致出現，首在使貨幣發行完全統一。貨幣旣統一，無比　選擇餘地，自無參差物價之事發生。其三，金融機構的調整，比在目前尤為重要，問題亦至複雜。吾人所要提出者僅有三點：一，中中交三行聯立式的中央銀行制度，决不適合於戰時的　常局面。統制金融的中心機關，仍應從速　織成立。其　，目前這種小銀行林立的銀行組織，决不適合於戰時的非常局面，如何促其集中合併，為當前應行研究的問題。其三，戰事發生後，上海的地位殆將難以確定，如何便政府離聞上海之後對全國的金融能指擇裕如，如　俠臂，為當前最値注意的問題之一。七舉三點為調整銀行制度的中心問題，願懸之以待國內賢達也。</p>

<p>— 卜愈之</p>
<p>在未入本題以前，先當說明三點：</p>
<p>本文的範圍，只就合會的「事實」分析估價，對於合會的論文和著作的意見，除非萬不得已，槪不牽涉。</p>
<p>作者派居國外多年，對於國內最近的合會趨勢，未能親自考察，最近　於合會制度的叙述，也未能一一閱讀，本文材料，只　所知的論著做根據。</p>
<p>本文　篇幅有限，對於合會的各種辦法，不能詳細說明，在此謹介紹兩本專著，以便讀者家考。</p>
<p>甲，王宗培著：中國之合會　民國二十年上海中國合作學社出版。</p>
<p>乙，楊西孟著：中國合公之研究（國立中央研院社　科學研究所叢刋第一種）民國　十四年商務印書舘出版。</p>
<p>一，中外對於「合會」的重視</p>
<p>從民國初年薛向舟先生和幾位朋友鼓吹德國　發巽的使合作銀行制度，民國八年創辦『上海國民合作儲蓄銀行』，九年又發行平民週刋宣傳合作學說，這便是合作的埋論和運動在中國的開始。</p>
<p>當民國　年，北方的大旱災蔓延五省，皒萃滿野，於是中外人才設法救濟，到民國十年救災以後，還多二三百萬元，因於民國—『年籌設「中國華洋義賬救災總會」，這是中國　村信用合作運動的　樞。</p>
<p>民國—七年江蘇省籌設農民銀行，並關辦「全作指　員養成所　，對信用合作運動的貢獻，也很重要，此外還有個人與團體，或從事鄱譯著作（如樓桐孫子樹德先生等），或作理論研究，參證實騐，（如上海中國合作學社），數目很多。到民國二十年，實業部更訂定「農村合作的誓行規程」。</p>
<p>在這擔出合作運動中，聯帶引起了一件事，非常重　，便是　班人對於中國一個老制度—合會的重視。幾年之中，在上海北平杭州…等地所出版的幾種重　的雜誌上，常看到關於合會的論文。民國二十年王宗培氏更出一尊書，題中國之合會，是合會在中國有專著的開始。今天商務印書館最近出新書，題是：中國合　之研究，又貢獻　材料很多。</p>
<p>從表　看，合會在民間不過是一件小小的玩意兒，幾年之間，竟有　多論文，兩本專青似乎小題大做，可是從合會的作用上，效率上，和影響上看來，還　國人對牠注意太少。</p>
<p>就作　所知，當　百五十七年前（西歷一七七八年黨乾隆四十三年）法國在北京的敎士們曾著中國民俗　（Memoires　Ccocenant　les　Chinese）其十六　冊，　　四同中（三八四　三八七頁）便是說明中國合會的制度。又在五十五年以前（西歷　八八〇年當光緒六年）勞缽　神父（Pere　Lebouca）曾久住中國著中國的集會（Asscciaons　de　la　Chine），書中介紹合會（　〇八　　　　　頁），　　詳細；而　於合會的方式簡單，友誼濃厚，稱贊很多。又在四十四年前（西歷一八九一年緒十七年），西蒙在中國任領事很久，對中國非常了解愛護，他曾著中國的城市（La　Cite　chinoisse），對合會的介紹，更加詳細，書末並附圖表七，說明各種會式，認合會是民間互相的妙品。</p>
<p>秋巴黎大學開學以後，經濟學敎援西明　（F.Simiand囑作者關於合會做一講演，在講演會中師人們對論很久，問題中最値得我們注意的有三　：</p>
<p>合會的起源問題有沒有解决？作者的回答是對於起源問題，沒有解決，但憑合理的推測，至少已有一千年左右的歷史。（據王著和作者推測都在千年以上）</p>
<p>合會在中國如此流行，何以中國立法上無明文規定？回答是：中國社會重道德不重法律，正和西洋的社會相反，並引孔子的一導之以德，之以禮有恥且格導之以政，齊之以刑，民免而無恥。作為根據。又引法蘭西學院社會學敎授謨斯（M.Mauss）的論點：「哀方國家」以道德習慣統治：西方國家以法律統治一（見所著敘述社會學綱目織於“Annales　Sociologigues”一九三四年巴黎Alcan）</p>
<p>合公在中國如此流行，效用如此大，究竟每年合會的團體有多少？參加的人數有多少？由合會借得的　項若十？合會的目的，生產的多還是消費的多？若是消費的多，是那一種消費的多？以上各點，中國沒有統計？作者除用推測的回答外，只能說中國還沒有統計。</p>
<p>至關於合會制度對於現代文化的貢瓛，大家無疑的　定了兩點：</p>
<p>對於「合作史」的貢獻：班經濟學家以為信用合作是近代的人物，若認合會是借用合作的一種，那麼這個結　　當，刻打破。</p>
<p>對於「合作制」的貢獻：全作主義雖經學著提倡，政府扶助組黨派鼓吹，現在還不免漸漸失勢，合作社的倒敗常有所聞，到於合會制學者不音，政府不問，可是能了然　然的在民間流傳千年之久，這其間必有牠的特點：這種特點，無欵的能　合作制人有貢獻。</p>
<p>對於合會的三個問題：合　的起源問題，合會應否有立法的根據問題，合會的統計問題，作著不騰　述出來，乃是盼望我們能列進一步的研究討論解決一班人的疑問。</p>
<p>至於合會有　種特點，事實上我們不能否認，幾年以　　於合會，中國有好多人主張應將合　改為合作，作　和巴黎大學幾位敎授談，他們又主張合作改為合　，將來的問題，究竟　將　合會合作化呢，運是將合作合會化」？這是很値得大家討論的問題。</p>
<p>大家如能將本文念完，明白了合會的價値，對於這個問題，我想不　解決，（未完）</p>

<p>人之生活，端賴營養以維持之，而攝取製造營養者，厥為人之胃臟耳。故胃强則身健，胃弱則病生。良以營養充足與否，定體之强弱也。</p>
<p>「强胃精」一藥，乃近代健胃藥中之新發現也。此藥含有極豐富之生命素，蛋黃素等費重成分。用極簇新科學方法製成之。凡有胃病及消化不良者服之，能使迅速吸收，將營養成分，分佈全體，而發出新的「生活力」。對於貧血，嘔吐冷惡，胃痙孿痛，腹脹，大便秘結，屁多，見飯生厭等症，服之皆因消化機能之改良，營養之補給，恍如枯木逢春，欣欣向榮，飲食培進，諸病皆去，體重大增，故世界有名醫家，莫不競相采用，譽為「胃藥之王」云。</p>

<p>淋病不能斷根，蓋出於患者之放任，及醫治之失當，致淋菌深入潛進。更因不知此毒已傳染其妻，己雖治愈，旋叉肉房事而復發，至證明正確斷桹之方法，卽凡經各種刺戟及血淸檢查等，而無淋毒反應者。皆可保其根治，永不復發。</p>
<p>故對於久治不能斷根之治法，如已結婚者，必須男女兩方同時療治。始可達到根治目的。住西藏路××里鄭少卿君，年卅歲，可婚十年，患淋巳有五年之久，雖經數决治愈，然回家後數日，即又復發，蓋其夫人亦早染淋毒，致白帶甚多。經余嚴密檢查之下，知鄭君巳變成攝護腺炎及睪丸炎等併發症，急先施以抗淋血淸，及Ｘ線與電療法，同時內服「克淋儂」，使在病灶上直接發生殺菌除炎，鎭痛利尿作用，治療月餘，復診四决，卽吿全治，其夫人之白帶糜爛，已延及膣道深部，妨害排尿及房事，隨即囑其內服「克淋儂」，以撲滅散處內部之淋菌。復外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」，於臨睡時取一片挿入　道，以除帶消炎，服用的四星期，白帶已凈，病痕平復，夫婦用血淸檢查，均無淋毒反應，偕居至今數年，均未復發。此乃老淋病正確斷根之鐵證也。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3 id="c213">國聯理事有什麼作頭？ <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 無聊</p>
<p>國聯本來是一隻紙糊的老虎，是幾個强國操縱和籠絡一般弱小民族的工具，故自九一八後，這只紙糊的老虎已經戳穿，至意阿一役，而這只紙老虎，可算已不復存在，故現在國聯的理事一席，莫說去運動，去要求，卽使他們拿了二十四版的帖子來請，亦只有以「敬謝不敏」四字答之。</p>
<p>自國聯成立以來，我國代表，力爭國聯行政院中理事一席，已非一决，卒以中國武力薄弱，與國內多故，均遭失望，今年九月，國聯行政院又將改組，行政院組織委員會已於近日討論理事席之分配問題，據該委員之議决後，則本年之國聯天會，應增加行政院非常任理事一席，以畁中國，委員會之决定，雖尙待行政院之核准，及大會三分之二通過，然觀今日之趨勢，中國本年之得重人行政院，似無甚大困難，這事雖感國聯行政院組織委員的盛情，承蒙關注，但是到現在時期，再欲到國聯去任行政院非常任理事，也可不必了，試問做了國聯行政院的非常任理事，是怎樣？不做國聯行政院非常任理事，又是怎樣？</p>
<p>我現在且略一檢討國聯數年來的政蹟，及近日國聯會員國的情形，加以考量，蓋現行國聯行政院之組織系統，實定於一九二六年羅加諾條的成立，德國加入國際聯盟之時，常時决定以英法意日德為常任理事，另添非嘴任理事九人，故國聯的組織，完全以英法意日德五國為中心，現在德國日本已退出國聯意國雖未退出，而自經國聯議决意國為侵略國後，國聯對於意國，已處反對地位，故意國名未退出，而事實上業已脫離，故現在的國聯，只有英法兩國為重心，及後來加入的蘇俄而已，但是英之與法，同床異夢，意見亦各有不同，所以英國亦有退出國聯之說，以如此情形渙散之國聯，而再欲去加入，眞是戇莫甚焉。</p>
<p>並且各國之欲加入國聯者，為其能帮弱小國家之忙也，能以國聯的力量，制裁强國的侵略，而以國聯為弱小民族的救濟機關也，但九一八之役，我國雖求籤問卜，虔誠禱吿，而效騐毫無，意阿之役，阿國亦力竭聲嘶，碰頭禮拜，國聯雖大施神通，而阿國竟卒消滅，其效果亦等於零，而國聯的會員國，對於國聯所納的會費，乃屬不貲，此種怨枉孽障的金錢，惟有寃大頭肯去浪費，故觀以上悄形，卽做國聯的會員國，已有所小屑，若欲做非常任理事，更是徒多此一舉矣。</p>
<h3 id="c214">開幕後 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 鄒衡</p>
<p>隔室是藥劑室，各樣大小的藥瓶子，擺滿了一行行白漆架子。穿着簇新西服的藥劑師，正在案頭調着藥膏。塗演香油的亮髮卜，映出一張瘦白的面孔。唇角上掛着一絲媚人的笑意。他一面工作，一面偷瞟着身旁正在剪紗布的女護士。</p>
<p>『密斯李，院長那裏去了？十點多了，不知掛號不？』</p>
<p>『還不是到小張屋去』密斯李看他一眼。</p>
<p>『到底今天掛號不掛號？他也沒吿訴聲。』</p>
<p>『那誰知道？好像你很高興做似的又看一眼。</p>
<p>『誰才高興！不過儘在這呆着多沒意思。我看呌老李問一聲罷。』他說着走近窓口。</p>
<p>『老李，老李，問院長今天掛號不掛。快點！』他喊。</p>
<p>『今天星期六，明天星期。若今天不掛號，起碼兩天—』密斯李輕輕算着說。說到後來又突然中止了，接着是一陣吃吃的笑。</p>
<p>『多好玩呀，兩天？』她一邊笑一邊說。</p>
<p>『下午到濟南去，好罷？』藥劑師走近她。</p>
<p>『多怎回來？』</p>
<p>『後天早車。—兩個整天。』他的手扶着她的肩。</p>
<p>『好罷，這地方眞要命，一天都住不得！什麼都土里土氣地。你說若眞是那些東西來看病，你認眞去給他們洗呀，敷藥呀！我想我會吐了。』</p>
<p>『眞是土地方！』藥劑師同情地說。『你看剛換了衣服，從街上走一趟就髒了。鞋子從泥道上踩過，回來就得重刷。過幾天我們還是回靑島罷。』韓倚了案子，抓着女人的手。</p>
<p>『院長說今天剛開幕不掛號。』老李在窓外喊。</p>
<p>『聽到了，去罷。』兩人相對一笑。</p>
<p>下午，大門旁又添了一張紙條：「本院因今日舉行開幕典禮，休息一日，改星期一起掛號診病。」（完）</p>

<p>— 李軒</p>
<p>老疤拉坐在廟門口，光着那浮了一層汚泥的脊梁，廟前是靜蕩蕩的。陽光打迎壁墻一直撒到五道爺神像的供桌下。老疤拉依着墻根，使隻油黑的手爪搔胳肢窩底下的肋巴骨。指甲息率的嚮着，細小的泥片像麩皮般飄落下來。他打了個哈欠，低下頭重又在那件夾色破軍裝襖上捉虱子，虱子沿着撕裂的縫里正蠕蠕的動着，白色的，在白色的小胖身子中，有個暗紅色小小的肚囊，他看着那小東西急忽怱，想要躱藏的樣子，便翻起那發黑的嘴唇笑了：</p>
<p>「往那兒跑！」</p>
<p>兩個手指輕輕的一攝，揉着，過一陣，虱子昏了，再把牠丟到脚底下的磚上，使姆指的指甲向下一擠，卜，發出一點微嚮，老疤拉舐舐嘴唇，自個兒開着玩笑的說：</p>
<p>「下一輩再來咬我，哈，」</p>
<p>虱子是那麼多，碴死一個，回過頭來再找，就又是兩個壘在一起的，老疤拉微微的笑着，他伸開手掌，將一口粘粘的吐沫噴在手心裏，兩手搓搓，然後，像匹螃蟹似的，展開兩隻背膊，每隻手的姆指跟食指張開，一變手捏住一匹虱子，把牠們分開了。</p>
<h3 id="c216">一羣被擯於學校圈外的流浪兒童 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 陳浩雄作</p>
<p>「你們倆幹麼那麼親熱，大白天！」</p>
<p>說着，便連卜卜兩聲，蚤給碴在磚上，死了。他把棉襖穿好，仰頭睢了應廟簷下的陽光，立起身，獨自嘟噥着：</p>
<p>「提不净的虱子拿不完的賊，—啊，該去找點東西吃了」。</p>
<p>剛拐過廟前的迎壁墻，從東而斜速里跑過了個人來。穿着黑襖，下身是條</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>破毛藍單褲，頭髮披散了一脖子，兩隻脚一跌跌的跑着像個老女人，懷着抱了個小女孩子，她大張着嘴，一邊哭，嚷着「我要我媽」，一邊用小手打那張瘦臉，　漢子被打的只扭腦袋，腿加緊的動着，口里上氣不接下氣的在發喘，歪歪斜斜的蹭到廟門口，看見有人，撩了下頭髮使又往西跑，可是老疤拉看出是誰來了，扯起嗓子就嚷了聲：</p>
<p>「馬靑，你抱的誰家的孩子？」</p>
<p>那傢伙給這一嚇，瘋了像的就直向鎭上鑽，這使老疤拉看着古怪，橫緊得到鎭里找吃的去，他惴踱着：這個嗎啡鬼鬼祟祟的定不會是好事，便一口氣跑着，追了上去，也跑着，嘴裏仍不停的喊：</p>
<p>「怎麼回事，幹麼像兎子遇了鷹像的」！</p>
<p>追跑着，那個嗎啡鬼始終頭也沒敢回，一鼓氣跑進鎭口，拐過一條小街，把懷裏的孩子撫起嘴來，旋風似的，轉進一個釘着「松井洋藥行」木牌子的小黃門，老疤拉追到門口，楞了，呼呼的噓着氣，　里邊，知道是韓國人開的藥針房，他坐到門旁的石台上，肚子覺得更餓了，抱着兩隻胳膊，想不透馬靑那小子搗的什麼鬼……</p>
<p>這時要邊小屏門里走出了個人來，沙拉沙拉的脚步聲，使老疤拉扭轉過臉，向里看了下，恰巧是楊猴兒，他們去年冬天同在五道廟里過了一整冬，現在他混好了，給洋行里「打雜」，老疤拉仰起臉說：</p>
<p>「猴兒」。</p>
<p>「你上這幹麼來啦？又不買藥，（嗎啡）」。</p>
<p>那個咕唧了下嘴，眼着對面這個嗎啡葫蘆，扎的都直不起腰的那樣兒，覺得變化得太快，霎了霎眼說：</p>
<p>「他媽我什麼也沒吃呢，你龍行里……」</p>
<p>「巧」，他拍了下手說：「你替我跑這趟差吧，給你兩毛錢」。</p>
<p>「什麼勾當，吮他媽牛皮，有兩毛錢？」</p>
<p>這個勾僂着腰的漢子一聲不嚮，打袋里掏出一片白紙來交給老疤拉，另外又拿出了兩毛的角票，這才像個主人似的吩咐着：</p>
<p>「你到北街胡家送了　封信去，說今天十二點以前帶五十塊錢到松井洋行來贖他閨女，明天來加倍」。</p>
<p>「嗅，原來是馬靑那小子幹這個！」</p>
<p>「這是好買賣，弄一個人能得十來塊呢，你不試……」</p>
<p>「不犯法？」</p>
<p>「我們是外國洋行，怕麼」。</p>
<p>老疤拉買了幾個燒餅一邊吃，一邊往北街走，路過住着外國兵的那所房子，門口掛着一幅有紅點子的旗，他想連這個春天整四年了，那年中國兵打了敗仗，以後就沒再看見過他們，這走道像鴨子樣的兵倒越來越多了。</p>
<h3 id="c217">茶花 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>「四月里冬靑開茶花，</p>
<p>年輕阿姐滿山爬，</p>
<p>可有那里來個小夥子，</p>
<p>臉兒俏，</p>
<p>唱出山歌順風飄，</p>
<p>唱得阿姐身上兩奶卜卜跳！</p>
<p>採得山茶又覅少，</p>
<p>阿姐工錢貼給山歌郎…………」</p>
<p>桂珍那破舊的藍布衣裳上，帶着輕便的布袋，那滿是靑春的紅雲底臉孔迎着太陽，四月的太陽好像她的臉兒一樣，帶着一點兒害羞地爬上了山崗，那遼遠地展開着的山崗呀！舖滿了碧綠的山茶，在她們的眼珠子里反照出寂靜底盡圖。這一羣年輕的姐兒們紛紛地爬上山坡了。她們大都唱着溫柔而迷人的山歌。桂珍一邊天眞地跳着，頭搖了搖，那根黑辮子在春風里飄了一飄。就在這當兒，從那小樹的叢葉枝底下，扔來一塊石子，跟着透出了嘻嘻哈哈的笑聲，桂珍的心胸卜卜地跳了一跳，睜着眼睛的望過去：</p>
<p>「是小眞那臭嘴貨呀！」罵着，一跳一跳的跑了過去，「什麼時侯來的？」</p>
<p>那年輕的女兒，小眞，沒有回答她，只是禁不住地笑了一會才在叢葉里說道：</p>
<p>「不要跑來呀！你猜一猜，這兒還有那個？你的山歌郎在等侯你了！」</p>
<p>桂珍的臉兒紅熟了起來，像掛在東方的天空上的太陽似的。</p>
<p>「唱呀！桂珍姐兒！你底歌聲比阿郎的歌聲還要好聽哪。」</p>
<p>「嗅！眞會捉弄人，你原來跟小夥子混在一塊兒呢！還要造謠哪！」</p>
<p>桂珍說着，就哈哈地笑了起來，拉緊了她們兩　的膀子，快樂的心房卜卜地跳躍着，跑向山崗上去了。這是淸明的時節，下過了幾天雨，這乾燥的原野，現在已經舖滿了潤濕的露珠，遍野的山茶「抽靑」了，帶着黃紫色和淡綠色的茶芽都開放了，在溫柔的風里，輕輕地盪漾着，遠遠近近，都滿是採茶的姑娘們出現了，她們的身子那麼輕盈，活潑，燕子似地在跳着，伸開了手臂，開始忙着採茶的工作。桂珍，小其，阿四，她們三個也是這座茶山里採花的姑娘，所以，一爬上山坡來，就可以遇見了許多相識的姐兒們，大家一夥兒的唱着，吵着，呌着，可是，她們的手，却不斷地採摘着，很少工夫去望着遠遠的山崗，和漸漸兒溜走了紅艷的光彩的太陽。可是，她們大都是年輕的姑娘，愛說愛笑，像桂珍，小眞，就不斷地說說笑笑的，有時，桂珍偷偷地折了一些枯枝扔在小眞的竹籃里，跟着，用左手壓着自己的布袋口，一邊兒哈哈地笑了起來。</p>
<p>「別纏別扭哎！我今晚對你的情郎說，你在山上吊上了別人！」</p>
<p>「你去說吧！我沒有那個，只有你才有十幾個，阿四！你說對嗎？」</p>
<p>阿四趕緊了採取靑嫩的茶蕊，聽到</p>
<p>她們在胡扭，禁不住的抬起頭來：</p>
<p>「鬼才知道，你們都有十個八個！」</p>
<p>說着，三個兒都禁不住地笑了起來。</p>
<p>「好呀！小眞，可憐她，那臭嘴貨沒有男人，你讓給她三個兩個吧！」</p>
<p>「老是胡鬧，你看，人家都採得滿滿的了只有我們採得少，怎好回去見人呀！」</p>
<p>阿四掀着嘴巴說着，她想到了家，家里選有老母！病弱的老母，她不能上山採茶了，所以，除了她的哥哥在別人家里做田工外，家里的零用還要靠她採茶的收入來幫輕的，可是，她雖然有氣力，又會採摘，最多不過採得十五六斤，（很少人會採到二十斤的。）每斤也不過四枚銅元，整天的採呀採的，才不過一百個銅元呀！………………想着，心里又焦急起來了。</p>
<p>「眞不容易呀呀！」阿四嚕囌着：「看！今年的春天太冷了，山茶大都受了凍枯，淸明到了，雖然下了幾天雨，可是，還有好多未發芽呢！」</p>
<p>「眞的！這樣看來！探上三五天，就沒有得採了！我們又沒有工好做了！」</p>
<p>桂珍變得沉悶地說着，抬起頭來望着滿野的綠茶樹，和滿野的採茶的姑娘們，太陽已高高地掛在半空了。她又想起了去年的茶價低落，貨品滯銷來：</p>
<p>「也許，今年也是一樣沒有銷路吧！聽說，外洋，上海，都滿是東洋貨了。」</p>
<p>她們一邊說着，一邊探着，望着那並不滿是嫩芽的的茶崗，太陽快要落下</p>
<p>尚有本埠增刋轉入第五版</p>

<p>去了。可是，她們煙是　着肚子，挨着酸痛的腰，緊張地採着茶葉。</p>
<p>「桂珍姐兒，聽說在劉家採的只有三枚銅元一斤，而且那把稱又大得很呢！」</p>
<p>小其搖着頭脫，阿四接着說下去：</p>
<p>「收成不好，又沒有銷路，我們採茶的也更苦了！」</p>
<p>桂珍的腦袋里想到明天，後天，也許，茶就沒有得採了，沒有工錢了………抬起頭來望了望她們，嘆了一口氣的說：</p>
<p>「太陽落山了，天就要黑了！我們回去吧！」</p>
<p>當她們挽着手的，跟着那許多女兒們，三三兩兩的，跑下了陰暗的山坡了，那淸淸楚的山歌，又跟着春晚的風，輕輕地飄揚着：</p>
<p>「日落西山一點黃，</p>

<p>President Chiang's Instruction</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Chiang's instructions at the local administrative conference on the morning of the 10th were titled "The Purpose and Key Points of the Local Administrative Conference." The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Outline" The purpose of the conference is to review the effectiveness of local administration to reform malpractices and improve efficiency. The key points of the conference are: 1. Each person should contribute as much research material as possible; 2. Deliberate on the advantages and disadvantages of current administrative laws and regulations (with special attention to the rationalization of expenditure use); 3. Close connection between local government departments; 4. Education should focus on enriching teachers and training unemployed youth; 5. The most important tasks in civil affairs are (A) improving police administration, (B) implementing land administration. It is hoped that there will be mutual learning and discussion so that this conference can achieve the most satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Fellow comrades, in March two years ago, we convened a conference of senior administrative personnel from various provinces in Nanchang to discuss improving local administrative matters. At that time, it was decided that such a conference could be held annually, both to hear reports from various regions and to discuss ways to improve. However, last year, I was stationed in Sichuan, and transportation was inconvenient, so I was unable to convene it. Now, the Executive Yuan has convened the chiefs and inspectors of various provincial departments to hold the second local administrative conference here. At the opening of the conference today, I would like to briefly report to you the purpose of convening the conference and the key points of discussion. Roughly speaking, the most important purpose of each of our conferences is to focus on the past year, especially the two basic aspects of local administration, namely civil affairs and education. We want to take advantage of the opportunity of this conference to report on the actual implementation and the practical experience gained by everyone, so that everyone can report, learn from each other, and jointly discuss in order to improve past shortcomings and solve current difficulties, so that local administration can be accelerated in the future. This is the purpose of our conference. As for the key points of the conference, to sum it up, there are the following items: First, the biggest purpose of our conference is to use the actual situation of our local governance and everyone's experience as materials for research, to increase the efficiency of local administration. Then, the most important basic task for all of us attending the conference is, of course, to present the actual situation of local governance and our own experiences, especially our recent special insights, as well as the difficulties encountered and the shortcomings discovered, to the conference as much as possible, so that everyone can get good materials for research. Second, regarding the various existing administrative laws and regulations, whether they are regulations or systems related to organization, personnel, or funding, can they be implemented effectively in various places? Are there any obstacles? And what is the situation of implementation? What are the advantages and disadvantages? We hope that everyone will conduct an objective review and practical research at this conference, and then consider the advantages and disadvantages to achieve perfection. Because our country is still in a difficult and creative process, especially since the situation in various places is very different, it is very difficult to apply a regulation or system universally across the country. Therefore, all laws and regulations must, under the principles established by the central government, adapt to the specific circumstances of each place, consider the advantages and disadvantages, and make various adjustments and remedies, so that they can be used flexibly and measures can be appropriate. This matter requires the conscientious discussion of all comrades attending the conference, especially regarding the funding item. Now, whether in the central or local government, it has become a very difficult problem. To solve this problem, there are only two ways: increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. However, except for the future when transportation, agriculture, mining, and related economic industries can be developed to increase revenue, it can be said that there is no source to open up based on the current situation. As for the method of reducing expenditure, the central and local governments have been paying attention to it recently. In this difficult period, everyone should, of course, try to save as much as possible, using one penny as ten. However, based on the current situation, I am afraid that the funds that can be saved in various places are also very limited. We cannot increase revenue, and it is difficult to reduce expenditure. Then, how will the problem of various expenses be solved in the future? I believe that the most important and relatively easy way to do this is to make a comprehensive calculation of existing expenditures, distinguish the essentials and the non-essentials of the cause, the relative importance, the order of urgency, and the size of the benefits that can be generated, and make reasonable adjustments to increase or decrease them. We must always shift from slow to urgent, from light to heavy, and transform the useless into the useful. I think that although the funding in various places is difficult now, if we make a detailed plan according to this principle and allocate it appropriately, we can definitely increase the efficiency of politics greatly. For example, the funding for security teams used to be the responsibility of the county itself, and it was impossible to count. Now, each province has unified it across the region or the province, which will reduce a lot of wasteful and wasted expenses compared to before. If we find a way to reorganize it in the future, I believe that we can definitely save more expenses. Now, various places spend a lot of money to support security teams. Some of them are corrupt, neither like the national defense army nor like the local army. This kind of nondescript army is of no benefit to the country and is often harmful to the local area. It should be reduced and the remaining funds should be used to handle baojia or improve the police, and its effect must be more than it is now. This is just one example. There are many other aspects that can be reduced and tightened, and the useless can be turned into useful expenses. As long as all comrades can discuss with a "public and loyal country" mind, they will definitely come up with a solution and achieve considerable results. Third, there are, of course, many reasons why the administrative efficiency of various places has not been greatly improved in recent years, and the lack of horizontal connections between the civil affairs, finance, education, and construction departments is also one of the important reasons. Each department only cares about its own affairs and cannot truly work together as a whole. We must know that a provincial government is originally a whole, so it is divided into four departments, but this is only for the convenience of work, so that each is responsible for its own responsibilities in order to promote it. In terms of spirit and cause, it is originally an inseparable whole, especially the promotion of all the work of each department and the development of the cause, which are all closely related to success or failure. Only when everyone works together can we truly do things, and it is not good to each govern its own government. Therefore, civil affairs must take into account finance, education, and construction, and education must take into account civil affairs, finance, and construction. Any department must take into account the other three departments, especially civil affairs and education, which are closely related to each other and must be in close contact with each other. Only in this way can they complement each other, and no matter what the matter is in civil affairs, finance, education, or construction, it can be done with half the effort and double the results. Therefore, although the chiefs of finance and construction departments of various provinces did not attend this conference, the civil affairs and education chiefs should also pay attention to discussing the affairs of finance and construction in various provinces. At the same time, when discussing civil affairs and education matters, they must also take into account the situation of finance and construction. All the methods for mutual assistance and cooperation between the various departments to work together as a whole in order to improve administrative efficiency, I hope that everyone will pay attention to discussing at this conference. Fourth, if we want to develop education in the future, on the one hand, we must try to popularize it in order to increase the quantity, but on the other hand, we must strive for quality improvement in order to progress. In terms of our current strength and the actual needs, we should first seek quality improvement for education, and then increase the quantity. Because the most serious problem in our country and society is not that there are too few literate citizens or educated people, but that these educated people, who account for only a very small number of the total population, have unhealthy knowledge and abilities, and most of them do not have appropriate occupations. Those who are responsible for school education and social education cannot properly guide ordinary people and school-age children who lack knowledge. Therefore, if we want to develop education, we must first improve education. If we want to improve education, we must first improve teachers, especially to train a large number of primary and secondary school teachers. If primary and secondary school teachers cannot be healthy and do not understand the purpose of education and the responsibility of teachers, our education will be useless no matter how popular it is. Moreover, bad education will spread. Under bad education, the more literate people are educated, the less our society and country will benefit. Therefore, in the future, whether it is the central government or various local governments, we must first pay attention to cultivating healthy teachers to improve education, and first be able to improve in terms of quality, and then gradually promote it in terms of quantity. Only in this way can education develop healthily, and the country can have a solid foundation. Now, many young college graduates are unemployed. These young students have all been educated by the society and the country for a long time, but they do not have the opportunity to serve the society and the country. This is really the most contradictory phenomenon and the greatest loss to the country and society. If we want to remedy this in the future, it is best for the central government or local governments to find a way to convene these unemployed college graduates and give them the necessary training so that they can become healthy primary and secondary school teachers and mentors to the people, and shoulder the basic work of various aspects of civil affairs and education in various places. This matter has infinite benefits for both the youth themselves and the society and the country, and it is not difficult to do. Now, when the post office wants to recruit postal workers and ordinary agencies record events, the monthly salary is only a dozen or twenty yuan, and there are often only two or three vacancies, but hundreds of people come to apply. This shows the difficulty of life in general and the number of unemployed students. Therefore, although we do not have a lot of funds, it is not difficult to train a large number of healthy teachers. In the next year, our primary and secondary school education is expected to increase by one-fourth in terms of quantity. We should now hurry up to train one-fourth of the primary and secondary school teachers to prepare for supplementation. In the future, we will train teachers year by year, which can gradually reduce the number of unemployed college or secondary school graduates, and gradually improve and popularize our education. How can this matter be implemented effectively to promote the benefits to the fullest? I would like to ask everyone to pay attention to research. Fifth, I believe that the most urgent things in civil affairs are two things: in the negative aspect, we must improve police administration; in the positive aspect, we must implement land administration. We know that whatever things in the world, if they are not beneficial, they are harmful. For example, the police were originally used to maintain public order and increase social welfare, which is of course very important and very beneficial. However, now the police in our country are useless and harmful. If we go to various rural areas to investigate in person, we will know that the police in many places now not only cannot maintain public order and increase welfare, but also cover up smoking, gambling, prostitution, poverty, extortion, and even collude with bandits to oppress good people, and commit all kinds of evil. Not only the police in remote areas are often like this, but also the police in big cities cannot be completely exempt. The police in various places have such bad habits on the one hand, and on the other hand, they have too little funding, so it is not easy to improve the police. Therefore, I have always believed that the police in various places with insufficient funding are absolutely useless and harmful to the people. It is best to abolish them all and replace them with baojia or groups. You have been engaged in local administrative work for a long time, and you must know that the teams in various places have the problems of the teams, the baojia have the problems of the baojia, and the local bullies have the problems of the local bullies. Among the various morbid states, especially the problems of the police are particularly numerous. How should we reduce, train, reform, and refresh them in the future so that they can fulfill the responsibilities of the police? I hope that everyone will pay special attention to research. This is the most important thing in the negative aspect of civil affairs work. As for the positive aspect, it is to implement land administration in order to solve the land problem. Everyone must know that the land problem is a fundamental problem in politics, and land administration is a basic work in politics. If land administration cannot be implemented perfectly and the land problem cannot be solved properly, political construction will not only fail, but also be impossible to promote. Everyone should not think that to implement land administration, we must first raise a lot of funds before we can proceed. If so, our land administration will not be able to proceed with anything and will never be done well. Therefore, we must regard this as a fundamental and important policy, raise a part of the most necessary funds, and try our best to implement it. At this conference, everyone should report on the situation of land administration in various provinces, refer to each other, and make a common resolution to serve as a basis for promotion in the future. The above are the few brief points that I would like to raise to you today at the opening of the conference. I hope that everyone will discuss these points carefully. It is really a rare opportunity for senior administrative personnel from ten provinces to gather together. I hope that everyone will take advantage of this opportunity to contribute their experiences and opinions as much as possible, learn from each other, and discuss with each other, so that this conference can achieve the most satisfactory results, and the administration of various places in the future can achieve the greatest progress, and we can fulfill our responsibilities and complete our mission of teaching the country and saving the people.

<h3 id="e3">Large-Scale Smuggling of Petroleum into North China; U.S. Consulate in Tianjin Lodges Protest with Customs; More Than 31,000 Cases Arrived Last Month; U.S. Petroleum Sales Market Almost Completely Seized; Tianjin Customs Revenue Sharply Reduced <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The U.S. Consul-General in Tianjin protested to the Customs, stating that a total of 31,000 cases of smuggled gasoline and petroleum arrived last month, with a cost of $5.35 per case. The unloading locations were Yanghekou, Nandasi, Beidaihe, and Changli Liushouying in eastern Hebei. 13,000 cases have been transported from the 1st to the 9th, flooding the market. A certain petroleum company in a Tianjin concession specializes in this business, and the U.S. oil sales market has been almost completely seized. The British Consul-General will also make a similar representation. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The U.S. Consul-General has protested to the Tianjin-Qinhuangdao Customs regarding the smuggling of petroleum into North China and dumping at low prices, demanding a stop. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Armed gunboats of the Japanese Tianjin-Qinhuangdao and Zhifu Customs are seizing smuggled ships in the Bohai Bay south of the Laotieshan Cape. Eleven ships of 500 tons each have been seized so far. The Governor-General of the Kwantung Territory has protested to us through the Tianjin Consulate, alleging intrusion into public territorial waters. Negotiations are underway. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tianjin Post Office is paying attention to inspecting parcels sent abroad, and if it finds suspected smuggled goods, it will stop sending them and hand them over to the customs for inspection. If there is no tax bill, it will be confiscated. Previously, it could receive and send 4,000 parcels per day, but now it has been reduced by half. Smugglers have probably abandoned this route. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to Tianjin Customs statistics, the total tax revenue collected by the Customs and the tax cards at the Great Wall ports last year reached more than 41 million yuan. Due to the impact of smuggling this year, it has been reduced by as much as 20 million yuan. Although export taxes have increased by hundreds of thousands of yuan, it is far from enough to compensate. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) From November last winter to the end of last month, the Tianjin-Qinhuangdao and Great Wall ports lost 20 million in customs duties due to smuggling. Although export taxes increased by hundreds of thousands, the difference is huge. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Korean laborers formed labor groups at the Qinhuangdao wharf to contract for unloading smuggled goods. Recently, Japanese laborers also formed labor groups to compete for business. On the 9th, a vicious fight broke out over the business, resulting in many casualties. The Japanese Consulate in Tianjin dispatched a large vessel, Zhongren, to investigate on the 10th. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to Japanese investigations, from March 23 to the present, the Japanese ships transporting rayon and sugar that have been intercepted by the Customs anti-smuggling gunboats are Yurong Maru, Bianyang Maru, Fuan Maru, Dengzhou Maru, Xifu Maru, Changsheng Maru, Shoude Maru Zhoufashun, Hiruko Maru, Feihang Maru, and Xintongshun, totaling eleven ships. The places where they were seized were all 120 nautical miles south of the Laotieshan Cape in Lushun and the Customs ship lies in wait at 60–70 nautical miles between the Laotieshan Cape and Zhifu. When a ship carrying smuggled goods comes, it follows it, then speeds up to intercept it near Changli or outside Zhifu port. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding smuggling in North China, a certain party stated that if the Hebei-Chahar authorities cannot follow their instructions and make some performance, and want to seek assistance in cracking down on it to achieve a complete ban, they must adapt to the current environment in North China, reduce the tax rate, or change the method of collection. Otherwise, they cannot help in any way. Xiao Xichao, an inspector from the Ministry of Finance, took the resolutions made in Tianjin and returned to the Ministry to report within days. The trip to Chahar, Shanxi, Shandong, and Suiyuan was postponed. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 9th and 10th, ice police intercepted several smuggled ships in the Ziya Daqing Southern Grand Canal. Japanese Consul Nagai protested again. The municipal government and customs decided to take a consistent attitude, saying that anti-smuggling is our legal action and there is nothing wrong with it. They decided to reply separately on the 11th. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Dai Jitao went to Shanghai on the night of the 10th and will take the German mail ship "Gneisenau" to go abroad on the 20th. Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, Wang Yongbin, Minister of Judicial Administration, and Jiao Yitang, President of the Supreme Court, hosted farewell banquets at noon and evening of the 10th. The Boy Scout troops in Beijing each sent ten Boy Scouts to the Xiaguan Railway Station in the evening to see him off. Dai will meet with Wang Jingwei in Germany to inquire about his injury. Many important figures in Beijing have personally written letters for Dai to take with him. Dai Chuanxian said that he was ordered to represent the government to participate in the World Games. As he had not been overseas for many years, he planned to take this opportunity to visit various countries in Europe to observe the recent construction situation, so he left early. He will take a train to Shanghai tonight and leave the country by ship on the 20th. If Mr. Hu is in Hong Kong when passing through, he will visit him. If Hu stays in Guangzhou, he may not be able to visit him because the ship will only stay in Hong Kong for a few hours. He will land in Marseille to visit the sights of major French cities, and then take a train to Germany and Italy to visit Mr. Wang and convey the greetings of the central colleagues. Then, he plans to go to various parts of Europe to observe the recent political situation and construction of various countries, and arrive in Berlin before the end of July. After the World Games close, he plans to have a long talk with Mr. Wang. If Wang recovers by then, he plans to invite him to return to China on the same ship. (10th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e11">The League of Nations at a Critical Juncture <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>As Italian troops advance into Addis Ababa, the capital of Abyssinia, the fate of Abyssinia is about to end, and the League of Nations in Geneva has reached a final critical juncture. Since Italy launched the aggression war in East Africa on October 3 last year, the League of Nations has declared Italy an aggressor and imposed economic sanctions. Since then, the economic war against Italy by more than 50 countries has followed the Italian-Abyssinian war. Now, after seven months, the East African War has ended due to the poor equipment of Abyssinia, and the economic war against Italy by the League of Nations has not achieved significant and rapid results due to the uneven front among its member states. After the end of the East African War, will Geneva's economic war continue or stop? If it stops, it will not only show that Italy has defeated Geneva, but also that the fate of the League of Nations will end with the failure of Abyssinia. If it continues, it will be unwanted by those countries that hold pragmatism. In such a dilemma, the League of Nations has reached a final critical juncture.</p>
<p>Because of the serious blow Geneva has suffered, governments are now discussing how to deal with the aftermath. Some advocate reorganizing the League of Nations, deleting the provisions of Articles 10 and 16 of the Covenant, and making it purely a peaceful organization for mediating international disputes. Others still advocate continuing sanctions against Italy to maintain the last breath of the League of Nations. The British government is naturally most concerned about the future of the League of Nations, because the implementation of sanctions against Italy by the League of Nations was largely due to the power launched by the United Kingdom. Therefore, the failure of sanctions and the victory of Rome over Geneva is tantamount to the victory of Italy over the United Kingdom. Regarding the aftermath of the League of Nations, the Conservative government mostly advocates ending sanctions and reorganizing the League of Nations' organization. Prime Minister Baldwin said: "The British government, in view of the failure of collective action in the Italian-Abyssinian war, must clarify the status of the League of Nations." Foreign Secretary Eden also said in the House of Commons debate on foreign policy on the 6th: "The League of Nations' actions failed to prevent the outbreak of war before the war was waged, nor could they stop the war from proceeding after the war was waged. At most, the League of Nations only makes war more difficult and costly... The government will deal with the difficulties it encounters in a pragmatic spirit and with constructive political means." In addition, former Foreign Secretary Chamberlain and Lord Louraine in the House of Lords also advocated stopping sanctions and reorganizing the League of Nations. However, opposition party members such as Dalton and Attlee firmly advocated continuing sanctions. South African Federal Prime Minister Hertzog even advocated maintaining sanctions against Italy for several years to force Italy to make concessions. In addition, representatives of Northern European countries such as Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and the Netherlands met on the 9th and unanimously advocated observing the attitudes of Britain and France. If they cannot obtain any real and concrete results, they will consider forming a new League of Nations based on principles of justice. It is expected that the Executive Yuan, which will meet today, will discuss the Italian-Abyssinian issue, but the passage of the resolution to terminate sanctions is certainly not yet the time. However, the survival of the League of Nations will ultimately be decided in the near future.</p>
<p>In recent years, because aggressive imperialists have successively withdrawn from the League of Nations in Geneva, the League of Nations has become a relatively better organization for maintaining international peace. This setback is due to the lack of sincerity of major powers such as Britain and France in truly upholding the collective system. Many people hate the League of Nations because it cannot effectively help Abyssinia. In fact, the League of Nations is not a supreme government. It itself has no power. Its power is entirely based on its member states, especially the people who love peace. At a time when aggressors are complacent and the world is full of gunpowder, the establishment of a collective security system is very urgent, and the organization of the League of Nations is still an important factor in the collective security system, so it is necessary to continue to exist. However, the League of Nations has now reached a final critical juncture. How to maintain its life and enrich its power is a problem that people who love peace need to consider and solve.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Local General Budgets for Various Provinces and Cities in the 25th Year Must Be Handled in Advance, and the Review Procedures for Provincial and Municipal Budgets Will Be Shortened <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The 24th year is coming to an end, and many provinces and cities still have not submitted their local general budgets for the 23rd and 24th years to the central government through legislative procedures. It is said that the reason for the delay is that the review during previous decisions was delayed for too long. For example, at the beginning of the preparation of a provincial local general budget, the provincial government first reviewed it, and after submitting it to the Executive Yuan, it had to be reviewed again. After being forwarded to the Central Political Council, it still had to be reviewed. The Central Political Council sent it to the Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounts and Statistics for compilation, and after transferring it to the Legislative Yuan, it had to be reviewed again. In order to be cautious, each agency has undergone four decisions of review. There was once a provincial budget in which questions arose during the review, and when the province was asked to send personnel to Beijing to state their opinions, the personnel in the province had already been transferred. If this continues, it will lose the original purpose of establishing a budget system. Now the 25th year is about to begin. It is hoped that the national general budget for the 25th year can be completed according to the precedent of the 24th year before the beginning of the year, and it is still difficult to determine whether each province and city can complete the legislative procedures uniformly before the beginning of the year. In addition to instructing each province and city to handle the local general budget for that year in advance in order to comply with the spirit of the budget system, the central authorities will also find ways to shorten the review procedures for provincial and municipal budgets in order to save time and avoid delays.

<p>(Washington) Foreign policy observers here believe today that the European crisis caused by Italy's annexation of Abyssinia will be more serious than when Mussolini launched his troops to attack Abyssinia. In the future, conflicts over control of the Mediterranean will be unavoidable. Britain's need for free passage through the Suez Canal to connect with India and the East will be directly opposed to Mussolini's repeated statement that "the Mediterranean will be Italy's lake." Moreover, Britain's desire to maintain the European balance of power and maintain peace through collective security is also a cause of international tension. State Department officials stated today that they have not yet received formal notification regarding the status of Chargé d'Affaires Engert in Abyssinia, so they are unwilling to express what steps the U.S. government will take. President Roosevelt has sent a telegram to Mr. Engert, praising his spirit during difficult times and promising to recommend him for promotion. (9th National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Paris) Édouard Herriot, leader of the Radical Socialist Party and Mayor of Lyon, recently published an article in the party's newspaper, the "Action Report," discussing the international situation. He believes that the crisis is imminent and that the League of Nations has collapsed and France has been isolated. The cause is that domestic opinions in Britain are divided, the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente countries have lost credibility and have to seek help themselves, and the dictatorial countries control everything and do not hesitate to despise the liberal countries. "On the one hand, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini annexed Abyssinia with straightforward means, and on the other hand, he prepared to listen to the League of Nations' mediation and re-participate in negotiations on collective security. What he did was to disregard everything. How can we be so ignored?" (10th Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e16">New Roman Imperialism; Mussolini Announces Annexation of Black Lion Country in East Africa; Italian King Gains Title of Emperor of Abyssinia; Badoglio Appointed as Foothold <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) Tonight, amid the chiming of church bells and the sound of whistles everywhere, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini announced to 200,000 people in the Piazza Venezia that Abyssinia would be incorporated into Italian territory. When Mussolini delivered his speech, the public was so excited that almost every sentence was interrupted by cheers. Mussolini said that he had officially ordered the Abyssinian Empire to be placed under the full and complete sovereignty of Italy. Italian King Emmanuel III has added the title of Emperor of Abyssinia. Abyssinia will be ruled by a governor, and the governors of Eritrea and Somaliland will be under his control. Mussolini then announced amid thunderous cheers that General Badoglio, who had triumphed in East Africa, would be appointed Governor of Abyssinia.</p>
<p>Mussolini said in his speech: Italy has finally completed its empire. This is the fascist empire with the Roman seal of indestructible determination and power. This is also an empire of peace, because Italy wants to be at peace with itself and all other countries. However, if any country wants to oppose us with force, we must defend ourselves. The young generation of Italy has been painstakingly working for fourteen years for the purpose of this empire. This is the tradition of Rome, because Rome, after victory, always merges with the defeated nation, coexisting and prospering together. This brings an era in Italian history to an end and opens a great gateway to the possibilities of the future, to enter a new era. Can you be up to the task? After the crowd shouted that they could, Mussolini said again, "This cry is nothing less than a great oath before God and mankind that will never change."</p>
<p>Mussolini's speech did not mention the League of Nations or any countries related to Abyssinia. This is particularly noteworthy. It is expected that the Italian representative to the League of Nations, Aloisi, will refuse to discuss the Abyssinian issue at the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting on Sunday, deny that the Abyssinian representative, Mr. Monde, has the right to be a "subject" of the new empire, and will demand that he (Aloisi) be the sole representative of Abyssinia.</p>
<p>Tonight, before Mussolini made this historically memorable announcement, the Fascist Supreme Council met for ten minutes and the Cabinet met for three minutes to pass the annexation of Abyssinia.</p>
<p>Today, the people of Rome are so happy that words cannot describe it. Hours before Mussolini's announcement, people flocked to the Piazza Venezia, waiting for Mussolini's appearance, causing the streets in the city center to be blocked by vehicles. The Piazza Venezia was extremely beautiful, with all the houses decorated with electric lights, illuminating it like daytime. When Mussolini gave his speech, the Roman garrison was stationed around the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. (9th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Determined to Resist the World</p>
<p>(Rome) Italy's decision to annex Abyssinia is an act of resistance to the League of Nations and the United Kingdom and France. When the League of Nations Administrative Council meets on Monday, Abyssinia, with 350,000 square miles and 10 million people, has already been swallowed up by Italy as a fait accompli. Mussolini claimed today that Italy will defend this newly acquired territory with red blood, which shows its determination to resist the world. Now, among the titles of Italian kings, only the monarchs of Britain and Japan are comparable. Mussolini's speech lasted eleven minutes. He said, "Italians have created an empire with red blood and should make it prosperous with labor. Italy wants peace with the world and does not want war unless forced to do so. Therefore, its empire is an empire of peace, and for the people of Abyssinia, it is also an empire of culture and guidance." (9th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Various Countries Adopt a Reserved Attitude</p>
<p>(London) Authorities around the world have adopted a reserved attitude toward Mussolini's declaration on the annexation of Abyssinia. No one is making comments lightly. French political circles are not surprised, but they do not conceal that this move is unfavorable to all parties, especially Britain and France. British Foreign Secretary Eden and his entourage only said before going to Geneva, "This is what we expected." Political circles in Berlin refused to comment, saying that Germany has always maintained a neutral attitude and will not change now. The Berlin Daily said that the title of Caesar was resurrected not in Rome but in Africa. This is truly a great fantasy of fate. Mussolini's actions have brought Africa closer to Europe and will inevitably cause new problems and dangers. Geneva is speculating on the actions that various countries will take, and is focusing on Britain and France. Many people feel that although France is willing to turn a deaf ear to Italy's aggression, it also did not expect such a serious result. All the small countries are very frightened. At the same time, the Americas all believe that the United States will abide by the Stimson Non-Recognition Doctrine, as before with "Manchukuo," and refuse to recognize the new situation created by force. The American public now recognizes this as the foundation of American policy. (10th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Rome) After Prime Minister Mussolini announced the annexation of Abyssinia last night, citizens cheered and danced all night, and went to the Royal Palace to cheer and pay tribute to Italian King and Emperor of Abyssinia Emmanuel III. The king accepted the congratulations on the balcony. Celebrations were held simultaneously throughout the country. In addition, Prime Minister Mussolini received British Ambassador Grandi at the Palazzo Venezia, as well as the envoys of countries that did not participate in sanctions, including German Ambassador Hahaner, Japanese Ambassador Sugimura, the Brazilian Ambassador, the ministers of Hungary and Austria, the Chargé d'Affaires of Albania, and their military attachés. (10th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) 60,000 soldiers of the army, fully armed, stood in front of the Palazzo Venezia at 8:00 p.m. last night. The officers were all wearing uniforms, gathering on the stone steps of the monument to the Unknown Soldier of the European War. Military songs and Fascist Party songs resonated with each other. The Prime Minister's residence and the statue of King Emmanuel I (Emmanuel I was the founder of the unified Kingdom of Italy) were illuminated by electric lights, as bright as day. Wounded soldiers who participated in the Italian-Abyssinian War were all dressed in colonial military uniforms. When the crowd saw them, they cheered and paid tribute. The railings of the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia were filled with Fascist Party flags. Envoys from all countries that did not participate in sanctions were invited to participate in the grand ceremony. Members of the Italian royal family also appeared on the balcony of the residence to watch. The scene was unprecedentedly grand. (10th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>People from the League of Nations in Geneva recently declared that when the Administrative Council meets tomorrow, it will definitely refuse to file the fait accompli created by Italy, and maintain legal relations with the Abyssinian government. That is, the sanctions measures will probably not be lifted, because the legal status of a country can never be changed by the unilateral actions of other countries. The Abyssinian representative, that is, the Minister to France, Mr. Wold, is officially appointed by the Abyssinian government and has the right to represent the country at the Administrative Council. For example, when Germany occupied Belgium in 1914 and Austria occupied Serbia, this did not affect the legal status of Belgium and Serbia. The matter is exactly the same. (10th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Administrative Council of the League of Nations is scheduled to hold a regular meeting tomorrow. In general, it is believed that the Council will postpone the discussion of various important issues, especially the Abyssinian and Rhineland issues. However, people from the League of Nations recently declared that at tomorrow's meeting, all major issues, especially the Abyssinian issue, will be submitted for discussion. The Italian representative, Aloisi, will probably speak first, stating that the Abyssinian state no longer exists, and demanding that the Abyssinian representative, Mr. Wold, the country's Minister to France, not attend the meeting. The Administrative Council will definitely reject this, without a doubt. At that time, the majority of representatives, especially the British representative, will definitely protest, and other countries, including France, will submit a reservation.

<p>(Paris) The Cabinet held a meeting at 4:40 PM and concluded at 7:00 PM, discussing the attitude France should adopt at the League of Nations Council meeting. Foreign Minister Flandin gave a detailed report on the new situation regarding the Italian-Abyssinian issue and the developments of the Locarno Pact. He stated that France was adopting a reserved attitude towards Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. He also said that France had been working hard to develop a common policy with Britain on the Italian-Abyssinian issue and had been in constant contact with the Italian government, hoping to find a suitable basis for resolving the dispute that would be acceptable to both Britain and the League of Nations. The Foreign Minister then presented and read aloud many correspondences between the British, French, and Italian governments. He also mentioned the questions raised by Britain to Germany, stating that they differed from those he had raised at the end of March (referring to his speech on March 29 in the Yonne constituency). The Locarno Pact will now be fully handled by the future cabinet. The current cabinet's documents exchanged with various governments regarding German rearmament will soon be published in the form of a Yellow Book. The Foreign Minister finally mentioned Turkey's request to re-establish defenses in the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits, saying that France supports discussing this matter. The Cabinet unanimously approved the Foreign Minister's explanation and then adjourned. The results of yesterday's political situation discussions between Prime Minister Sarraut, Orthodox Socialist Party leader Léon Blum, and Radical Socialist Party leader Daladier were not brought up for discussion at today's cabinet meeting. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the Italian government formally announced the annexation of Abyssinia, the French government issued a statement to that country, reserving all rights. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the Italian government announced the annexation of Abyssinia, newspapers here, such as Le Petit Parisien, L'Écho de Paris, L'Intransigeant, and Le Petit Journal, all focused on the potential diplomatic consequences. Berthold, a renowned journalist from L'Écho de Paris, stated, "The cabinet discussed this issue at a state council meeting yesterday morning. Foreign Minister Flandin expressed the opinion that if Italy directly annexes Abyssinia, it will be difficult to abolish the sanctions decided by the League of Nations on November 18 last year. Britain's attitude in Geneva will be supported by other countries. This opinion has been accepted by the State Council and instructed to Minister Bengough, who is not a member of the cabinet, to follow it. Bengough has also obtained the agreement of Léon Blum, the leader of the Orthodox Socialist Party, who is the future prime minister. However, in our view, what should the British government do about this issue? This question, while not impossible to answer, is difficult to answer at present. The British Baldwin cabinet is still wavering between two divergent opinions and is truly in a dilemma. However, after Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, the pro-sanctions faction in Britain will definitely use this as an excuse to make their case. It is especially feared that today, the principle has been broken, and sanctions cannot save the situation. In short, Abyssinia has been defeated, and the war has ended. How the current problem is resolved and its potential international impact should be taken into account." Paul Guirgand, a renowned journalist from Le Petit Parisien, said, "After Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, the League of Nations has encountered a major difficulty. The only way to overcome this difficulty is to postpone a decision. In other words, the League of Nations cannot abolish the sanctions at this time, nor can it tighten their implementation. If they are abolished, it would be self-defeating and reward aggression. However, if they are tightened, it would violate the League of Nations covenant, because once a war ends, punishing the victorious country is not provided for in the covenant. At tomorrow's Council meeting, representatives from various countries plan to simply prolong the current situation. In addition, the communist newspaper L'Humanité only disclosed the decree issued by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, with the headline 'Fascists Have No Regard for Others.'" (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Since the meeting of the seven countries, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Spain, and Switzerland, there have been many rumors. Some say that these countries will withdraw from the League of Nations as soon as the Italian-Abyssinian dispute cannot be resolved satisfactorily, while others say that these countries have decided to jointly pressure the Executive Council to take immediate action to maintain the prestige of the League of Nations. The meeting of these countries ended this afternoon and issued a communiqué stating that these countries remain loyal to the League of Nations. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Member states of the League of Nations that remained neutral today held a closed-door meeting to discuss the situation caused by the Italian-Abyssinian war and the League's failure to curb the war with sanctions. As a result, they unanimously decided to adopt a wait-and-see attitude. The foreign ministers of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands, as well as representatives from Switzerland and Spain, attended the meeting and unanimously agreed to wait and see what proposals Britain and France would make at the League of Nations Executive Council meeting on Monday. Danish Foreign Minister Munch stated that he would wait for the development of the situation and consult with allied countries on all matters. According to the consensus of today's meeting, the League of Nations' failure to protect Abyssinia does not preclude the possibility of building a more solid foundation for the current League of Nations. However, if no genuinely concrete results can be obtained, they are very willing to consider proposals to reorganize a new League of Nations based on the principles of justice. The neutral countries' meeting expressed great sympathy for Germany's return to the League of Nations. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<p>Berlin The British Admiralty decided yesterday to reorganize the mail ships belonging to the Cunard White Star Line in that country, so that they could be equipped with six-inch guns. The expenses required will be borne by the country's Admiralty. When this news reached Berlin, German shipping industry figures commented one after another. The Berliner Tageblatt published an article saying, "Will all British mail ships sailing on the Atlantic from now on be armed? From this, we can see that the atmosphere of military preparations has permeated the whole of Europe, and the psychology of the people of various countries can also be glimpsed. International law makes a very strict distinction between merchant ships and warships. After British merchant ships are equipped with gun emplacements, they should be regarded as warships.

<p>Versailles The aviator Truillé, who served as the aviation advisor to the Abyssinian Emperor, disregarded the official ban on April 25 and arbitrarily flew an airplane from the Villacoublay airfield here to the Abyssinian capital to welcome the Abyssinian Emperor to France. Unexpectedly, he landed in the Italian city of Salsomaggiore and was detained by the Italian authorities. He was only allowed to fly back in the original plane this morning and arrived at the Villacoublay airfield here at 5:45 pm this afternoon. Beforehand, Home Guard members, journalists, and photographers had heard the news and were waiting at the scene. When Truillé flew out on April 25, the police chief who was in charge of escorting him was also waiting in the crowd. When Truillé got off the plane, the police chief wanted to take out the arrest warrant issued by the Prosecutor's Office to arrest him. Many of Truillé's relatives and friends and well-wishers at the scene came forward to protest, but he was eventually taken to the Prosecutor's Office by two gendarmes. Because the Prosecutor's Office had issued an arrest warrant after Truillé left here, he had to report to the case for interrogation at this time. However, he was released after a preliminary hearing. According to reports, there were also many private lawyers and journalists on the plane that came with Truillé today. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<p>Madrid The general election was held at the Crystal Palace at 10:45 am this morning and was completed at 12:15 pm this afternoon. The interim speaker of the House of Representatives, Jimenas, announced the election results at 2:00 pm this afternoon. Out of 847 votes, the incumbent Prime Minister Azana won the presidential election with 754 votes against 120 votes. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Madrid The presidential election is scheduled to be held today. Half of the voters are members of the House of Representatives, and half are representatives of the national voters recently elected, a total of 925 people. Political figures predict that the incumbent Prime Minister Azana can be elected with a majority of 800 votes. The right-wing People's Action Party, the right-wing Catholic Party, and the Royalists, led by the former Landelino Lavilla Alsina, will vote against him. The left-wing Radical Party, led by Carballeiro, would rather Azana remain as Prime Minister. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Madrid The new president, Azana, was born on January 1, 1880. He studied at a church school from an early age. After being admitted to the University of Madrid, he joined the famous Liberal Literary Research Association and organized the Restoration Party. In 1923, he joined the Republican Party and conspired to overthrow the late dictator General Rivera. In 1925, he recruited various Republicans and organized the "Civil Governance League." In 1930, he was elected as the chairman of the "Arden Valley Association" of the Republican faction and formed an alliance with the leaders of various Republican factions in San Sebastian to prepare for the revolution. He also organized a revolutionary committee and launched uprisings in the cities of Gallaecia and Madrid, but both failed. He then fled abroad. On April 14, 1931, after the revolution was completed, Azana took office as the Minister of the Army in the Zamora Cabinet and dismissed all the officers of the imperial faction. In the same year, he succeeded Zamora as Prime Minister. In August 1933, he resigned due to a vote of no confidence in the House of Representatives and took the position of leader of the opposition party. In 1934, the right-wing and central parties overthrew the government and seized power. Azana, as one of the key figures of the left wing, was immediately arrested and imprisoned. He was released soon after his imprisonment. After his release, he carried out anti-government movements and joined forces with the left-wing parties to organize the "People's Front." On February 16 of this year, the results of the general election of the House of Representatives showed that the left-wing parties had won a great victory. Azana then made a comeback and resumed his position as Prime Minister. Later, President Zamora was forced to resign, and the government decided to elect a successor president today, and he was elected president by an overwhelming majority. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>(Dalian) After returning here from Tokyo, President of South Manchuria Railway, Matsuoka, convened a meeting of the Railway Bureau staff today and decided to immediately pilot a coal liquefaction plant in Fushun that can produce 20,000 tons of oil per year. The production will be expanded in the future to meet the needs of the whole country of Japan. It is reported that Japan currently needs 3.5 million tons of oil per year, most of which comes from foreign countries. The coal liquefaction method will be entirely Japanese-style, and almost all the machinery used in the plant will also be made in Japan. However, it is reported that the hydrogenation method of British oil production will also be used. Matsuoka said today that this move is not only for the South Manchuria Railway's business but also has national implications. Prime Minister Hirota and the cabinet both support this matter.

<p>(Tokyo) The Army believes that the "Manchuria" immigration problem is to solve the Japanese population problem. At the same time, from the perspective of national defense, it is also very important. Therefore, the Army is carefully considering the immigration policy that Seiyukai is advocating. The Army has already decided on the following policy to complete the first line of national defense. The methods are as follows:</p>
<p>Manchuria Immigration After several decisions to send agricultural immigrants and confirmed that the results are sufficient, the government should quickly review the immigration policy again, place its main focus on this, establish an immigration policy, make a plan to immigrate hundreds of thousands of people every year, and must allocate a considerable amount of budget to provide subsidies. Dispatching a large number of immigrants to Manchuria is absolutely necessary from the perspective of national defense. In the future, the military preparedness of the Kwantung Army and the mobilization of conscription on the spot should be placed in a possible state. The Army's view is that from Meiji 8 to Meiji 32, the reserve and reserve soldiers were used to take charge of the security of Hokkaido's inland areas. At the same time, a military settlement system was established to reclaim cultivated land. The system of combining soldiers and farmers should be established in Manchuria. This method is currently being studied. (Domei News Agency, 10th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador to Belgium, Kurusu, is scheduled to depart from Yokohama on the 14th to take office. The other ambassadors, Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Yoshida, and Ambassador to China, Kawagoe, will also go to their respective places of assignment soon. However, Foreign Minister Arita, who advocates liberalism and activism, is looking forward to seeing concrete developments after each ambassador takes office. That is, the principle of maintaining and developing the people's right to survival. The only way to implement the continental policy with Manchuria as the center is to do so. Furthermore, the Soviet Union's military preparedness in the Far East will be further strengthened, and it will inevitably conflict with Japan's policy. Therefore, in order to implement the Japanese policy, coordination with countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and France should be avoided, and friendly relations should be maintained, especially with the United Kingdom, the stable force in Europe. Furthermore, the policy towards China should also be based on Prime Minister Hirota's three principles, temporarily refraining from rapidly resolving political issues and focusing on promoting friendly relations through economic cooperation. After the opening of Japan-Russia relations and the stabilization of the situation in East Asia, formal work will be carried out. Arita diplomacy, which is slightly different from the tendency of the former Foreign Minister Hirota, is worthy of legal interpretation. (Den Tsushin, 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e37">Taking Taiwan as a Major Base: Japan's Southern Advance Policy, Conspiratorial Activities in South China and Southeast Asia, Hoping to Achieve its Dream of Dominating East Asia <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>A special article from the Hualian News Agency: Since the occurrence of the North China Incident, it seems that the people of our country are not as concerned about the trend of the Japanese government's southern advance policy as they are about the mainland policy. This is a big mistake. Although Japan's offensive in North China is becoming increasingly urgent, its management in Taiwan, its conspiracies in South China, and its activities in various parts of Southeast Asia are all likely to cause serious situations. The Japanese government's ambition is to annex the entire China, control the weak nations along the Pacific coast, and fulfill its dream of dominating East Asia. The trend of its foreign policy, regardless of north or south, is closely related to the survival of our country and nation. After the establishment of the Hirota Cabinet, Navy Minister Nagano requested an expansion of the naval budget to a total of more than 550 million yuan to expand naval power and implement the southern advance policy. He also recently announced a new marine policy, determined to actively develop in all directions of the South Pacific. At the same time, he is also very active in the provinces of South China, such as the activities of Japanese adventurers in Xiamen and the secret activities of Han traitor organizations in various counties in southern Fujian, all of which are directly or indirectly assisted by Taiwan. This is something that we must pay close attention to. In order to realize the above-mentioned goals, the Japanese authorities are planning to change Taiwan's administrative organization, fill the governor's post with military figures, implement the unification of military and political affairs, and plan to establish a colonial company as a major base for economic aggression. This plan is currently being discussed in a special parliament, and the date of its realization should not be far away. As for the strengthening of the army and air force, efforts are also being made. The Taipei airport has been completed. The construction of this airport took seven months. The equipment is completely scientific, and its function is said to be the best in Japan. The keynote of the new naval policy recently announced by the Japanese government is completely consistent with the mainland policy of the Army Ministry, that is, to make the superiority of Southeast Asia a further preparation for dominating East Asia. The Japanese government's development towards Southeast Asia mainly targets Siam, Borneo, Malaya, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies, in order to confront the British and American navies and plunder natural resources. Therefore, the previous visit of Osami Nagano to the mandated islands was to plan for the establishment of defenses on the islands to cover the implementation of this marine policy. Japan's management of the Philippine Islands has not been a day or two. Currently, 60% of the land on Davao Island is owned by Japan, which shows the expansion of its power. The Japanese in the island intend to form a solid base as preparation for future wars. Therefore, the Filipinos said that it is possible to erupt a second "September 18th" incident, which is not unfounded. However, in the Japanese plan to dominate Southeast Asia, the management of the Philippine Islands is not a major task. Their current policy seems to be focused on the East Indian Islands and the Kra Isthmus of Siam. We all know that the East Indies are rich in natural resources, with oil reserves being the most abundant, which has long been coveted by the Japanese. But in addition to this, the Japanese also want to get involved in the island of New Guinea to cut off the connection between Hawaii and the Philippines. The second is the plan to cross the Kra Isthmus of Siam. In order to prosper Indochina and facilitate transportation with their own country, France once encouraged the Siamese government to carry out a canal digging plan, while Britain strongly opposed it due to military reasons, because if a canal is dug here, it will make Malaya a dead port. Now Japan is doing its best to contact Siam to promote its realization, and has repeatedly decided to send survey teams to carry out surveying and mapping in the name of studying geography, entomology or natural science, and has been trying to win over the Siamese government, hoping to eliminate the resistance of Britain and France, and carry out the excavation with Japanese capital assistance. Now a competition among Britain, France and Japan has been launched around this issue. Britain recently added 2 million pounds to its national defense expenditure to strengthen the defense preparations in Singapore, the target of which is nothing more than preparing for Japan's ambitions. In short, in the low-pressure Southeast Asia, Japan has the possibility of causing disputes anytime and anywhere. After Japan's decision to withdraw from the naval treaty and implement its marine policy, its future will become even more uncertain.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The case of Lieutenant Colonel Aizawa assassinating Lieutenant General Nagata, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, in the Army Ministry, after the first trial of the first division was held on January 28 this year, ten consecutive trials were held. However, on February 26, the continued trial was suspended due to the outbreak of the incident. The authorities transferred the judge and renewed the trial. The first public trial was held on April 22. At the same time, all newspapers were prohibited from publishing news. At 11:30 p.m. on the 9th, the Army Ministry officially announced the following:</p>
<p>The case of Lieutenant Colonel Aizawa killing Lieutenant General Nagata was tried by the first division's military law conference. However, as a result of the outbreak of the rebellion incident, a part of the judges were replaced, and the case was retried. Five public trials have been held since April 22. However, the presiding judge believes that the debate in this case endangers the current order and military interests, and prohibits publicity. The trial continued, and the verdict was announced on May 7. On May 8, Lieutenant Colonel Aizawa appealed the verdict to the Army High Military Law Conference. The full text of the verdict is as follows:</p>
<p>"Aizawa Shiro, reserve army infantry lieutenant colonel, post-five rank, and the fourth class, former belongs to the Taiwan First Regiment, head of the family of samurai in No. 1, East Sixth Street, Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture, is accompanied by the case of assaulting superior officer and murdering harm. The present Military Law Conference is prosecuted by Judge-Army Judge Shimada Tomosaburo, and the judgment is as follows: The defendant is sentenced to death, and the seized military sword is confiscated.</p>
<p>Summary of the Judgment Reason</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The summary of the Army Military Law Conference's judgment reason for Lieutenant Colonel Aizawa is as follows:</p>
<p>The defendant has always had a strong sense of respect for the emperor. Since Showa 4 (1929), he has recognized the necessity of the so-called Restoration, and his acquaintance with comrades such as Oishi Yoriyoshi, Okura Eiichi, Nishida Zei, Muranaka Koji, and Isobe Senichiro strengthened his belief. By Showa 8 (1933), he believed that in order to achieve the goal of the Showa Restoration, the national army should thoroughly understand the principle of the national polity. However, the current situation of the army runs counter to this. In March of Showa 9 (1934), Lieutenant General Nagata Tetsuzan took office as the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau. Based on the speeches of the aforementioned comrades, he believed that Lieutenant General Nagata used the name of controlling the military to obstruct the Showa Restoration. At that time, Infantry Captain Muranaka Koji and First Class Paymaster Ishikawa Asakazu were suspected of having a rebellion conspiracy and were suspended from their duties, and he believed that Director Nagata and others were scheming to harm his comrades, and was very angry. Also, in his post in Fukuyama City, he read the newspaper and learned that General Mazaki had resigned from the post of Education Director, and presumed that this was the result of Director Nagata's instigation. Therefore, he met Nagata and personally reported his resignation, but after learning that Nagata had no intention of resigning, he returned to Fukuyama. Not long after, after reading the strange document "The Rebellion of the Military Clique and Senior Ministers", he believed that the change of General Mazaki was an infringement of the supreme command, and decided to assassinate Director Nagata. Therefore, on August 11 of the tenth year, he came to Tokyo and stayed at Nishida Zei's house. After the meeting, he decided to carry out the assassination of Director Nagata. At 9:30 a.m. on the decided day (i.e., the 12th), he went to the Army Ministry, first entered the Director of the Maintenance Bureau's office to meet with Lieutenant General Yamaoka, and sent an aide to spy on Director Nagata in the office. At 9:45, he entered the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau's office and saw Director Nagata talking with Colonel Niimi Hideo, the commander of the Tokyo Military Police. He immediately threw the military sword he was wearing and slashed his back. The director fell beside the reception round table, and then slashed his head and stabbed his lungs several times, including the left side. Director Nagata died at 11:00 a.m. due to the knife wounds. When he added the first knife to Lieutenant General Nagata's back, seeing the colonel get up to stop him, Aizawa immediately injured his right upper arm. (10th day, Dentsu News Agency)</p>
<p>Talk from the Army Authorities</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army authorities issued a statement. The most regrettable point about this case is the destruction of military rules. Military rules are the lifeblood of the army. Lieutenant Colonel Aizawa assassinated his superior Lieutenant General Nagata, regardless of the reason, disturbed military rules, and the reason for his serious crime also exists in this. According to the court's deliberations on the cause of the crime, he generally believed in rumors and was based on his own self-righteous views. It is extremely regrettable that such a pure-hearted person was misled by strange documents. The army strictly maintains military discipline in order to eliminate such behavior. At the same time, it is necessary to thoroughly crack down on the strange documents that are the direct cause of this incident. Also, assassinating such public figures often has important behind-the-scenes relationships as usual. The world also holds such doubts about this incident. However, after the trial, it was clarified that there were no other accomplices. (10th day, Domei News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e54">The Donations and Taxes for Enterprises Held in Various Provinces and Cities Should be Handled in Accordance with Legal Procedures <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Shuyong, chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Donation and Tax Supervision Committee, and others, submitted a letter to the Executive Yuan, saying that recently new policies have become increasingly complex, and most of the funding sources are not clearly defined. Local governments cannot cook without rice, so they set up various names to levy on the people, which is repeatedly burdensome and cannot be counted. The Central Government urged the abolition of exorbitant taxes and levies, and strives to implement it. Therefore, those who raise funds locally do not use the name of donations and taxes, but rather use certain expenses, believing that it does not involve the scope of donations and taxes, and can be free from legal restrictions. However, the funds contributed by the people, whether they are donations and taxes or expenses, are essentially the same. If this trend continues, after starting an enterprise and raising funds, arbitrary exactions will be made, and the people's strength will be unbearable. I am sincerely afraid that the benefits of the enterprise will not be developed, but the resources that can be exploited will be exhausted. It is a hindrance to both national planning and people's livelihood. After all, is the levy of taxes by local governments for the purpose of starting an enterprise, even if it is not called a donation or tax, should it be within the scope of donations and taxes, and can we be free from the restrictions of financial supervision laws? I have some doubts. After discussion, the people who were promoted and han asked your court to explain and instruct. If it is believed that it should be within the scope of donations and taxes, please order the provincial government to handle this kind of situation in accordance with legal procedures to show prudence. On the 23rd, according to Zhang Shuyong and others, the Executive Yuan notified all provinces and cities on the 9th that when a local government starts an enterprise and collects expenses, although it is not called a donation or tax, it is essentially no different from a donation or tax. It is true that you cannot avoid the name of donation or tax and be free from the restrictions of financial laws. At the same time, it also ordered the Ministry of Finance to comply.

<p>Capture of Seven Key Bandits, Yin Lidong Escapes</p>
<p>Xiamen Communication: In early April of this year, after the entire communist organization and maritime network of Xiamen Central City were dismantled, from late April to May 4th, the Anxi Anti-Communist Volunteers of the 26th Brigade of the 9th Division further dismantled the central hub of Anxi, Nan'an, and Jinjiang under Quanzhou Prefecture. On the 6th, the brigade headquarters issued the following report: After the leader of the pseudo-Liancheng District group, Peng Degui, the political instructor of the central county committee of An'nan Yongde, slipped into the vicinity of the city temple while our army was suppressing bandits in the third and fourth districts of Anxi, he gathered disillusioned local militias. In less than a month, it had become the First District of Anxi, with over 300 party members, over 600 civilians, and possessing over ten rifles and short guns. Due to the diligent suppression by Wang Lichun, Chen Jiang, Chen Shuxing, and others, except for the bandit Peng, Ye Che, Zeng Kui, and Li Jingwen who fled to southern Jinjiang, all personnel and weapons were resolved. Most of the civilians came from self-rehabilitation. Bandit Peng entered Jinjiang and Nan'an to provide assistance, forming a pseudo-organization in southern Jinjiang. On April 19th, the team, led by Wang Lichun, a rehabilitated individual, spent six days searching the area of southern Jinjiang, uncovering the location of bandit Peng and his main institution in Nan'an's Hehe. On the night of the 27th, they surrounded and attempted to capture bandit Peng in the area of Xidong, but he broke through and escaped. The next day, they captured Ye Che, the pseudo-reserve team leader, who confessed that Peng had been fatally wounded by bullets, causing widespread panic among the pseudo-party in southern Jinjiang. Over three days, they also captured Old Li, a highly effective reward recipient from the Li Lisan era, Chen Xiulan, a former worker at the pseudo-party headquarters of An'nan Yong, and Old Xie, a former pseudo-party military doctor from An'nan Yong, among others. On May 4th, they further uncovered the pseudo-central institution in Hehe. Yin Lidong, a key bandit leader from Quanzhou, escaped. They captured Lao Cai, an executive committee member of the pseudo-Southern Fujian Special Committee and leader of the guerrilla brigade, Xiao Fu, the propaganda chief of the pseudo-Southern Fujian Special Committee, and Cai She, the pseudo-reserve team leader of Jin Tao, Nan'an, among others. Investigations revealed that the local communists between Quanzhou and Yongchun were recently contemplating renewed activities, with Yin Lidong and Lao Cai as the masterminds, and Peng Deqing, Xiao Fu, and Cai She attached to them. Now that five bandits are either dead or captured, only Yin Lidong remains, who is now completely isolated. (May 7th)</p>

<p>(Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Cheng Jun) (9) Examination of the Daye Mining Area</p>
<p>Daye's mineral wealth is unmatched in the entire province. Gold, silver, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, tin, coal, and various other minerals are certainly produced, and all should be available. In addition to the gold mine in Jinshan Temple, the silver mine in Longjiao Mountain, the manganese mine in Baiyanglin, and the mica in Lingzi Mountain, iron, coal, lime, and cement are being separately mined and manufactured. Mining companies are numerous, employing a large number of workers, and have a significant impact on the countryside. In recent years, Yangxin and Daye counties have suffered successive disasters, with the rural areas of Yangxin completely bankrupt, while the people of Daye have been spared death. The suffering is the same, but the outcome is different, which can undoubtedly be attributed to the employment opportunities provided by the various mines. The largest mines include the Hanyeping Iron Works, the Xiangbishan Iron Mine, the Fuyuan, Fuhua, and Lihua coal mines, and the Huaji Cement Factory. The Xiang Mine is government-run, while the rest are privately run. Due to external treaty restrictions or sluggish sales, they are declining daily, all facing an uncertain future. There are more than twenty smaller coal mines, such as Fudong, Yuli, Huaxing, Fuchun, Siwei, Yue, Dehe, and Housheng mines, which are either still operating or have already closed down, and are even less worthy of mention. To understand the actual situation of each mine, the reporter traveled from Daye County to Shihuiyao on April 5th, spending four days visiting almost all the major mines and factories, gaining a great deal of information, which is detailed below:</p>
<h3 id="e71">Hanyeping Iron Mine <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The iron mine mined by Hanyeping Company was discovered in the second year of Guangxu's reign in the late Qing dynasty when Sheng Xuanhuai hired a British mining engineer to identify the geology and ore deposits. The mining area stretches hundreds of miles, and its reserves are estimated by German engineer Reulen to be at least 30 million tons. In the sixteenth year of Guangxu, Zhang Wenxiang, the Governor-General of Huguang, recognized the importance of industry and began government-led operations. Mining began in the same year, but due to objections from the Ministry of Revenue, it was changed to commercial operations in the twenty-second year. Records of iron production began at this time. In the thirty-fourth year, it merged with the Pingxiang Coal Mine and the Hanyang Iron Works, using the iron ore produced and the Pingxiang coking coal to smelt iron in the Hanyang Iron Works. The so-called Hanyeping Company included the coal from Pingxiang, the iron from Daye, and the ironworks from Hanyang. Later, due to the inconvenience of transporting iron ore to Hanyang, a furnace was built in Shihuiyao to smelt iron. Construction began in 1915 and was completed in 1919, but smelting has long been discontinued. However, iron ore mining continues.</p>
<p>The mining area is divided into two sections: Laotieshan and Dedao Bay. The Laotieshan section is divided into Tiemenkan and Shamaochi. Tiemenkan uses open-pit mining, while Shamaochi has tunnels. A total of 2,070 tons of ore sand are mined daily, producing 60,648 tons annually. Currently, the third layer is being mined, and the high mountain has been turned into a deep valley. After many years of excavation, the ore is nearly exhausted. The Dedao Bay section is divided into eight locations: Shishan Qianchang, Shishan Zhongchang, Shishan Qian Er Ceng, Shishan Hou Er Ceng, Shishan Hou San Ceng, Dashimen, Jiji Jianchang, and Shishilongdong, producing 396,000 tons of iron ore annually, totaling approximately 600,000 tons per year. A railway over fifty miles long has been laid from the mining area to Yuanjiahu. Yuanjiahu is the location of the mine factory, where iron ore enters the Yangtze River. The reporter arrived at the Yuanjiahu mine factory on the evening of the 5th. The factory area is large, and there are many workers. In the past, over ten thousand people worked there, and now there are no fewer than three to four thousand. Most of them are employed under a contracting system. Workers work eight hours a day, earning 12 cents per ton of ore mined. Generally, each person can earn 30 to 40 cents per day, and can also engage in agriculture. There is a compensation policy for deaths due to work-related accidents. Nearby farmers benefit greatly. However, due to debt relations, the factory is completely controlled by the Japanese. The laborers ultimately work hard, no different from working for others. On April 3, 1924, the factory borrowed 12 million Japanese yen from the Yawata Iron Works and the Yokohama Specie Bank in Japan, signing a contract to supply 15 million tons of ore sand and pig iron over ten years. On February 11, 1912, the Japanese government advanced 3 million yen and signed another contract. From then on, the ore sand was not allowed to be sold to other countries, and German engineers were replaced by Japanese engineers. On January 18, 1915, the Japanese government presented the Twenty-One Demands to Yuan Shikai, including Article 3, paragraphs 1 and 2, requesting that Hanyeping be jointly operated by China and Japan. The articles stated: "The two contracting parties mutually agree that when a suitable opportunity arises in the future, the Hanyeping Company will be operated jointly by the two countries, and unless with the consent of the Japanese government, the Chinese government shall not independently dispose of all rights and properties of the company." "The Chinese government especially allows all affiliated mines belonging to the Hanyeping Company to not be exploited by companies other than the company without the consent of the company, and agrees that if any borrowing is desired, whether directly or indirectly, that may affect the company, it must first be approved by the company." The Japanese government advanced from providing loans to implementing annexation, and subsequently, production declined sharply. Further loans were obtained from Japan, amounting to 30 million yen, bringing the total Japanese debt (including the entire Hanyeping) to 90 million yen. The Japanese then interfered with the factory's affairs as creditors, seizing sovereignty. Important positions such as chief engineer, engineer, chief accountant, and consultant were all filled by Japanese, and expenses exceeding 200 yuan were not valid without the signature of a Japanese. The situation was completely reversed, a complete disaster.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Xiangbishan Iron Mine <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The Xiangbishan Iron Mine is located northwest of Daye County, in Jiangjiawan, not far from Huangshigang and Shihuiyao. A railway leads directly to Shenjiaying for export on the Yangtze River. The mine is divided into three areas, with the Xiangshan area being the main one, divided into four layers. The first and second layers are each over 70 feet high, the third layer is over 90 feet high, and the fourth layer is over 100 feet high. The second is the Laoshuwei area, divided into two layers, one over 50 feet high and the other over 40 feet high, connected to the Shishan of Hanyeping. The boundary was only recently established. The third is the Jianshan area, which has not yet been mined.</p>
<p>Xiangshan is connected to Shishan. Previously, there were no mining regulations, and those who purchased land privately had mining rights. It was initially owned by a private individual. Hanyeping Company took possession of it because its mining area was very large. The mountain owner was unwilling to be controlled by them, so the Hubei Official Currency Bureau took it over with 400,000 cash, making it provincial property. Planning began in 1918, and actual mining began in 1920. It was successively managed by the official mining supervision office, the official mining bureau, the agricultural department, and the construction department. Currently, the Construction Department has organized the "Xiangbishan Iron Mine Management Office," with three sections: mining, transportation, and research, and a newly added general affairs section.</p>
<p>The reporter visited the Laoshuwei mining area at 3:00 PM on the 6th, then transferred to Xiangbishan and arrived at the office. Because it was too late, I could only briefly view the mining equipment. There is a generator, boilers, lathes, planers, drilling machines, a foundry, and a carpentry shop, all of which should be available. The total capital is 6 million yuan, and the scale is of course much smaller than that of the Hanyeping factory. However, China has sovereign rights and has not been seized by others like Hanyeping, which is something to be proud of. The daily mining volume is 1,000 tons, or several hundred tons, because it is open-pit mining, the amount of mining cannot but depend on whether it is sunny or rainy. The sales market is the Liuhegou Yangtze Factory, which only sells 90,000 tons per year, and most of it still has to be sold to the Japanese. There are over 600 workers in the entire mine, divided into inside and outside workers. Inside workers earn more than 30 cents per day, and outside workers are dedicated to mining, earning 12 cents per ton. Most of them can earn 40 to 50 cents per day, and can also engage in agricultural work.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Fuhua Coal Mine <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>In the morning of the 7th, I went to visit the Fuhua Coal Mine Company. The mine is located in Huangshiwan, with lush trees and pleasant scenery, unlike the barren iron mountains. The person in charge of the company warmly welcomed me and led me into the mine. I changed into worker's clothes, put on long boots, carried a flashlight, and bravely entered with a walking stick. I fell down an 18-meter-deep shaft. The mine is divided into three entrances, with horizontal and vertical tunnels reaching over 20 li. The room and pillar method is used, which is the latest design by mining engineer Wang Jiliang and deputy mining engineer Song Jun. The mine is equipped with electric lights, pumps, and other equipment. Water sounds can be heard everywhere, which is very different from the dryness of the iron mine, and the danger is also greater than the iron mine. The coal miners all work naked, sweating profusely, covered in black coal, with only their eyes shining like ghosts. At first sight, it is quite frightening, but looking at myself, I am not much different, and I can't help but laugh. The workers dig coal with great difficulty. If they are lazy, the foreman's whip will immediately follow. I have seen several people being flogged, not daring to say a word. I walked in the mine for about three hours, and my waist and legs were tired. I left the mine at 6:00 PM, and a heavy mountain rain fell with loud thunder. This could not be heard in the mine at all.</p>
<p>The mine area is 452.50 hectares. It produces lignite and is entirely commercially operated with a capital of 560,000 yuan. Wuhan and the downstream areas are its sales markets. In recent years, due to the economic downturn in various markets and the impact of foreign coal dumping, sales have been extremely sluggish. There are currently 30,000 tons of coal in stock, piled up like mountains. At its peak, the mine had 1,300 to 1,400 workers, and at its lowest, 600 to 700 workers, divided into 20 groups. Management is also quite effective, but wages cannot be paid on time. In the future, workers must still be laid off and costs reduced to maintain operations. It is reported that the company is discussing that sales are now bad, and taxes are also high, including property tax, financial committee donation, union donation, chamber of commerce donation, public security donation, first district donation, second district donation, public welfare donation, and other miscellaneous donations, amounting to over 2,800 yuan per month, which is truly unbearable during the coal industry's decline.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Fuyuan Coal Mine <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The Fuyuan Coal Mine is located in Tongzibao, Shihuiyao, with an area of 498.5378 hectares. It produces lignite, which is semi-anthracite, with an estimated reserve of 2 million tons. It was opened in the third year of Xuantong in the late Qing dynasty with a capital of 280,000 yuan, with Wuhan and the downstream of the Yangtze River, and the coastal ports of Fujian and Guangdong as sales markets, reaching 150,000 to 160,000 tons per year. Before 1931, profits were quite large. After the great flood, sales stagnated and prices fell, resulting in considerable losses and debts of about 200,000 yuan. The reporter visited the mine on the 8th, guided by Mr. Liu Liping to visit various places. The mine is divided into vertical shafts and horizontal tunnels. The vertical shaft is 200 meters deep, divided into two layers. There are two dark vertical shafts in the horizontal tunnel, each 100 meters deep. The caves are intricate, even more complex than Fuhua. There are about 1,200 workers, with the highest wages being about 50 cents per day and the lowest 30 cents. During prosperous times, there were still bonuses to be distributed. Each team elected a foreman to manage, and most of the short-term workers were nearby farmers. A worker representative office was also set up to facilitate contact with the employer. Currently, sales are sluggish, and inventory is piled up like a mountain. Wages have been in arrears for several months, the same as Fuhua. They are planning to merge with Fuhua, because the two mountains are connected, and mining will be more convenient after the merger, which can save expenses and jointly seek development. However, it is said that the opinions of the authorities on both sides are still inconsistent, and it is feared that it will be difficult to realize.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Lihua Coal Mine <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The Lihua Coal Mine has a long history of using French methods of mining. It was renamed to its current name in 1928. The mine is located in Huangjingshan, eight li south of Dajiangbian in Shihuiyao. The coal is a type of anthracite white coal with strong ignition and heating power. The coal seam is only one, with an average thickness of two meters and a reserve of 15 million tons, with a daily output of 500 tons, which can be mined for 80 years. Its head office is located in Hankou, and the mining area has a mining office, with a branch office in Shihuiyao, from which the coal is exported. Because Shihuiyao is separated from the mining area by the Huangjingshan Mountains, and the mountain is rugged, it is impossible to lay a railway. A German Braesi Tow-line aerial cableway was specially built to facilitate coal transportation. The double cableway in the air is a great sight. The reporter was received by Deputy Cheng Xingjian at the branch office. Due to the strong wind and rain, I could not take the aerial cable car to visit the mine, which was quite a regret. According to Mr. Cheng, the mine's engineering equipment includes a well project, with east and west vertical shafts for coal output, each with a winder, 156 meters deep. Currently, it only reaches 125 meters. The horizontal tunnels are each 1,000 meters long. Coal mining is entirely manual. Hard rock roadways are excavated, with a part using pneumatic rock drills. There are 20 large and small pumps in the well, which can drain 1,000 tons of water per hour. The air outlet has an electric fan and an electric blower. The mining area currently has an area of 500 hectares. After being reorganized again in 1932, the capital was increased to 500,000, and 1 million was borrowed. All equipment was completed in one go. Coal sales are mainly in Wuhan, followed by Shanghai and Nanjing, followed by Zhenjiang, Fuzhou, Shantou, and Xiamen. Because the coal selection is better, sales are relatively smooth. There are currently 1,200 prospectors, divided into contractors and hourly workers. Contractors are paid either by the foot or by the ton. Large workers earn 3,800 wen, and small workers earn 2,000, with the foreman providing meals and paying monthly. Therefore, workers are quite hardworking. Compared with Fuhua and Fuyuan, it seems to have vitality.</p>
<p>The above mines used to employ a total of over 30,000 workers, which was enough to save the rural economy during times of panic. Now, each mine is declining daily, with the number of workers reduced to over 10,000, and their treatment is not as good as before. It is difficult to maintain the remaining situation. The prosperous times will not return. Thinking silently about the future, I can't help but feel terrified.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Travel Notes from Qinghai (Continued) <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuang Juben</p>
<p>(3) The Mongolians of the Qunke Grassland</p>
<p>From the two Likjingles, we learned that there are eight Mongolian banners grazing in the Qunke Grassland. The density of banners is higher than anywhere else, such as Yongan and Qaidam, and it can be said to be a gathering place for the Mongolians of Qinghai. Now, all eight banners are listed below:</p>
<p>1. The Right Wing Leader of the Choros Tribe, Erlik Baylor, whose prince's name is Linqin Wangjile.</p>
<p>2. The Central Middle Banner of the Choros Tribe, Harge Beizi, whose prince's name is Zhashi Anmujile.</p>
<p>3. The Right Wing of the North Banner of the Khoshut Tribe, Zong Beizi, whose prince's name is Sonam Mu'andehai.</p>
<p>4. The Rear Banner of the Right Wing of the South Banner of the Khoshut Tribe, Tuo Mao Gong, whose Duke's name is Sonam Mu'pai Le.</p>
<p>5. The Rear Banner of the Left Wing of the South Banner of the Khoshut Tribe, Ake Gong, whose Duke's name is Labudan.</p>
<p>6. The Qunke Banner of the Left Wing of the South Banner of the Khoshut Tribe, Sack, whose Duke's name is Dan Zeng.</p>
<p>7. The Upper East Banner of the Khoshut Tribe, Bahaan Chorja Zasack, whose Duke's name is Le Duo Ri.</p>
<p>8. The Independent Banner, Chahan Qiejimen Khan (White Buddha) Zasack Grand Lama, whose name is Sui Ke Dai.</p>
<p>The Princes, Dukes, and Grand Lamas were all titles conferred by the Qing Dynasty. The subjects of each prince and duke are no more than a few hundred tents, or a few dozen tents, so their power is very small. The smallest banner, Bahaan Chorja Zasack, is said to have only two households. This prince is already nominal.</p>
<p>The Topography of the Qunke Grassland</p>
<p>On the 24th, the wind and clouds did not stop. In the morning, we watched the women milking cows at the door of the yurt. The cold wind and snow hit our faces, making us worry. Today, we planned to visit the pasture of Qunke Sack, but we heard that the prince had gone to Guanghui Temple in Datong a few days ago. Now we have to change our route to Chahannomen Khan to investigate the situation of the Independent Banner. At about ten o'clock, Erlik Beller sent Ula to see us off. Traveling west in the wind and snow, our hands and feet were frozen and sore.</p>
<p>After a journey of fifteen li, we crossed a river eight meters wide. The water had already frozen thick. The water source here is very narrow, drawing from its source. The river channel is slow and winding, stretching into the grassy mountains. A red rock mountain corner divides it into two tributaries, north and west.</p>
<p>The terrain on the grassland is open and gentle. The mountain slopes on both sides are gently sloping loess layers. Along the grassland, there is a depth that just passes the ankles. It reaches the upper reaches in the north, bordering Datong in the east, and facing Qinghai Lake on all sides. The area is also several hundred square miles, and the altitude is all above 3,000 meters above sea level. As the terrain goes up, the altitude gradually increases. Along the way, there are a few scattered yurts. Large herds of cattle and sheep are eating yellow grass, unafraid of the wind and snow. Now we climb that red rock mountain corner and cross the western tributary. The wind and snow slowly stopped.</p>
<p>Guided by the guide, we arrived at a village connected by adobe houses in the west. This is the home of the White Buddha. The owner of a tall adobe house welcomed us in. The stove with simmering mutton in the room was very warm.</p>
<p>The Tibetan Tribes of Mongolia</p>
<p>What is worth noting here is that their language is all Tibetan. At first, I thought that they were adjacent to the "Gangza" Tibetan tribe, so they could speak Tibetan. Later, I asked them, "Which ethnic group are you from?" And their reply, "We are Wu - Tibetan people."</p>
<p>Before coming, I already knew that Chahannomen Khan was an independent banner, without a prince but ruled by a Zasack Living Buddha. The Living Buddha is Tibetan and not Mongolian, so they are a special tribe. However, the results of investigations in all directions have now proven that not only is the ruling Zasack Lama Tibetan, but the ruled people are also Tibetan. There are a total of 6 tribes and 29 banners of Mongolians in Qinghai. Now Chahannomen Khan is a Mongolian banner that does not match its name. So the real Mongolians have only five tribes and twenty-eight banners. However, their special state of being Tibetan but Mongolian has aroused our historical interest.</p>
<p>They are a culturally backward nation without history, so it is difficult to know the evolution of their history. Later, in front of several elders, I obtained a small passage of legend:</p>
<p>Chahannomen Khan, the White Buddha, was sent from Tibet in ancient times to preach in Qinghai. Mongolians are very religious, so he often resides in Mongolian tribes. After Nian Gengyao pacified the west in the Qing Dynasty, he compiled Mongolians into banners and put him in the Mongolian banner, ruling Tibetans and becoming an independent banner, and was conferred the title of Zasack Grand Lama. Later, I obtained a more documented material from the Qinghai Southern Garrison Command in Xining:</p>
<p>During the Shunzhi period of the Qing Dynasty, the Tibetan Grand Lama Qi Yu Jiamu Cuo came to Qinghai to spread the teachings, and the Tibetan people obeyed and became the Seventh Hupilidong Khan. In the forty-fourth year of Kangxi (1705), the eighth Luo Bu Zang Jiamu Cuo entered the court and was granted the title of Chano Men, Khan Yongzheng awarded the title of Zasack in the third year. Chahannomen Khan is Mongolian, and the meaning of Khan in Han is "White Dharma King".</p>
<p>The Suffocation of the Lamb</p>
<p>This is the family of a steward of the White Buddha. The White Buddha is still very young, only ten years old this year, and is studying scriptures in a lama temple far away from here. He has 1,000 sheep, 300 cows, and 80 horses here, and his family property is not small. We wandered aimlessly in the village. Their houses are all three-dimensional bungalows. The building materials are only fir and loess, so the roofs and walls are mostly made of mud.</p>
<p>There are also farmland in the village. Their lives are half farming and half grazing. An average family cultivates five or six dou of land and raises dozens of sheep. The crops only produce highland barley, oats, and rapeseed, because the altitude is very high, already at 3,080 meters. The land freezes in July of the lunar calendar and thaws in March. There is often hail in summer. Last year, there was a severe hailstorm, so the crops were poor. In the past, this place was all pasture, and it was only reclaimed after 1919.</p>
<p>The climate is very cold. At 2:00 PM, there is a faint sunlight, and the thermometer still stays at minus five degrees. After eating tsampa and mutton, we also received a plate of mutton and a box of tsampa.</p>
<p>When we first arrived, the steward slaughtered a lamb to entertain us. A young lama took a fat sheep from the sheepfold and led it under the roof. He tied the four feet together and pushed it to the ground. Then he tightly wrapped the sheep's mouth with a woolen rope several times, preventing it from breathing. The lamb struggled on the ground, and the lama pressed it hard to prevent it from moving. After a quarter of an hour, the lamb's belly swelled and its eyeballs protruded. The lama found that it had suffocated, and then he started to skin it. The compassionate lama was also cruel for the sake of eating. The lamb's body was filled with purplish red hot blood, because the Tibetans like to eat blood-soaked meat (considering meat with blood as delicious), so the lamb is often subjected to such a cruel death.</p>
<p>There are more than a dozen adobe houses in the village, not many households, but the yurts nearby are all subjects of the Chahannomen Khan.</p>
<p>Social Life is Truly Free</p>
<p>We stayed in the village for two nights in total. The Tibetans nearby came to visit. The Tibetans here do not have any special clothing, only women. They also often wear Mongolian-style pointed hats, but there is no red thread tassel on them. Wealthy women hang many silver ornaments the size of bowls on their backs, usually twelve, four in a row, sewed on three wide belts, with a row of red tassels hanging below, and above are seven smaller silver ornaments or silver plates, directly connected to the ends of the braids in the middle of their heads. The silver ornaments are mostly engraved with beautiful patterns, with a red coral inlaid in the middle, very much like a pair of red knotted skullcaps. Their beautiful clothing weighs several pounds, which makes their heads feel heavy, so they use a leather cord to connect the decorations and tie them in front of their chests to reduce the burden on their heads. There are dozens of small braids around their heads, draped over their shoulders. Compared with ordinary Tibetan women, the Tibetan women here can all sing and dance. When we first arrived, we spent one yuan on wine in a merchant's yurt to invite them to sing. When they sing, they stand opposite each other, raising their sleeves and singing in a clear voice, but they sing more than they dance. The dancing movements are very simple, only raising their sleeves and turning around. It is also popular to sing and dance while toasting wine. When guests come, they sing a duet and offer a bowl of wine. Perhaps men and women are attracted to each other in the meeting, and they also sing and toast wine to each other to show their affection.</p>
<p>It is very common for girls to have a few days of free love among the Tibetans. According to the customs of marriage here, the new woman returns to her parents' home one day after entering the door, and only officially enters the door when she gives birth to a child. If the child is born late, and several years pass, then they will accommodate. Or, if the relationship between the couple is not good, then they will never come back like this. When the bride enters the door, two female attendants hold her armpits and walk through the gate of the man's house. The bride lowers her head and covers her face with her sleeves, showing her shy state.</p>
<p>Their social life is truly free. Today, a new guest wearing a fox fur hat came to the steward's house. At night, a beautiful Tibetan woman - a servant - slept with him in the kitchen. This was something that a sheep herder was very angry about and complained to the police about.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Guangkai Coal Oil Company, located at No. 14 Wubuyuan Road, previously loaded 200 barrels of San Gui coal oil and 1,300 pairs of new wicks onto the Zhang Qiaji Li Jiu sailboat to be shipped to Zhabei for sale. On the 3rd of this month, while sailing through the waters off Jinshanwei in this county, it suddenly encountered strong winds and waves, and dense fog covered the sky. The navigator lost direction and carelessly struck a reef. The sailboat sank, and all the coal oil drifted onto the sea, where it was secretly salvaged and profited from by local fishermen. The company's chairman, Xu Shiying, has telegraphed the county's Public Security Bureau to investigate. Director He has telegraphed the Ninth Precinct to investigate and seize [the stolen goods].</p>

<p>The Wuxian Fresh Meat Industry Guild, due to the recent scarcity of pig supplies from Danyang, Jiangbei, and other places, despite discussions on the afternoon of the 9th to consider increasing fresh meat prices, due to the shortage of incoming goods, there will inevitably be no goods available for the market. Therefore, it was decided that starting today (the 10th), all meat shops in the city will uniformly suspend slaughter for three days, while sending personnel to Danyang and other places to purchase pigs in bulk to supply the market, and requesting the Slaughter Tax Collection Office to appropriately reduce the slaughter tax.</p>

<p>Suzhou Anshi Middle School was established and funded by Cheng Wang Jichang, who resides in Xibaihua Lane. It has been five years since its establishment. However, the registration issue has not yet been resolved. More than ten graduates of another school, including Xu Guoyuan, concerned about the difficulty of transferring schools, specifically hired lawyers Zhou Yu and Zhang Yu to file a lawsuit with the Wuxian District Court, demanding that Cheng Wang Jichang compensate each student 2,000 yuan for losses. After repeated court hearings, the case has concluded, and the judgment is scheduled for 5:00 PM today (the 11th).</p>

<p>Wangzhuang, Yangjian, Langganqiao, and other places in the northwest of this area have traditionally been silkworm farming regions. This year, personnel were dispatched from the Silkworm Improvement Zone to provide guidance in the villages. Due to the uneven temperature this spring, the spring silkworms have been affected. The current silkworm rearing method involves joint rearing of young silkworms by the guidance center. However, hatching and the arrival of ant-like larvae are uneven. The early batches have already reached the third molt, while the late batches have not yet turned into ant-like larvae. The future harvest will inevitably be affected, and the general villagers are extremely anxious.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon (the 9th), the corpse of a murdered man was discovered by Kuncheng Lake in Youdun Village, outside Xiaodongmen. He had eleven knife wounds on his body, and half of his head and neck had been severed, a truly tragic sight. The village reported to the county for inspection. The corpse was particularly unusual. The first discoverer was a fisherman. The corpse was wrapped in a cotton quilt, then further wrapped in a straw mat and bound with ropes. The corpse's feet were particularly long, and they were curled up and tightly bound inside. Examination revealed five knife wounds on the face, half of the neck severed, and six knife wounds on the chest. It was confirmed that he had been murdered before being thrown into the river to eliminate traces. The county government has already ordered the village guards to collect and bury [the body] and is conducting a careful investigation.</p>

<p>In Chen Sifang, Meicun Town, Second District of this county, a widow, Madam Chen, is over forty years old. Her husband, Chen Fengwei, has passed away, leaving behind a beloved son of fourteen years. The family is of modest means, which attracted the covetousness of bandits. Last night (the 9th) at around 10 PM, four bandits suddenly arrived, each wielding iron bars and flashlights, and broke into the house. At that time, Madam Chen and her son were awakened from their sleep and got out of bed to prepare to hide. Unexpectedly, they were grabbed by the bandits and forbidden to make a sound. The bandits ransacked the boxes and chests, stealing 340 yuan in legal tender and one merchant's scale. After obtaining the loot, the bandits fled to the north.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Bengbu: Improving Tea Production in Western Anhui <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Western Anhui is known for its tea production, particularly the yellow tea from Huoshan, which is highly regarded. Annual tea revenue amounts to no less than eight or nine hundred thousand yuan. The new tea is already on the market, and it is said that prices are still good at the beginning of the season. The county's Tea Industry Guild believes that most tea farmers still cling to old habits in tea harvesting and production, adhering to outdated methods and failing to make improvements. They often over-manipulate the original tea quality, reduce drying and roasting, and mix in old, coarse leaves to deceive tea merchants and profit from it. As a result, the reputation of tea from this region in the Shandong and Hebei markets has plummeted in recent years, causing tea merchants to be at a loss. If this continues, sales will be blocked, and no one will inquire, which will have a profound and significant impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. In order to urgently seek a remedy, they have drafted measures to improve tea production and submitted them to the county government, requesting the elimination of old methods of harvesting and production commonly used by tea farmers, such as restricting tender leaf picking, prohibiting mixing of grades, and ensuring proper roasting. Detailed instructions have been given. It has been learned that the Huoshan County Government has expanded the presentation and strictly ordered various districts to instruct chiefs and heads of the Baojia system to earnestly implement these measures, urging all tea farmers and tea shops to comply with the improvements, so as to facilitate sales and save the rural areas.</p>

Ferry No. 6 will depart from the Bund terminal of Beijing Road at 5:20 AM today and go directly to the Dinghai Island Fish Market. All guests can wait at the terminal before 9:20 AM. The Fish Market will send staff to the terminal to take care of things after 8:30 AM.</p>
<p>Opening Tomorrow Morning: After the Fish Market opens this morning, it will begin operations at 3:00 AM tonight (i.e., 3:00 AM tomorrow morning). Currently, various fish businesses are enthusiastically participating in the market as brokers or wholesalers. Although some fish businesses had previously expressed non-cooperation and intended to operate in Xiaodongmen, the City Chamber of Commerce is advising them, so there should be no problems. As for the brokers, the market will give priority to fish businesses joining, and the market has notified the Fish Industry Association to inform all fish businesses that it will not monopolize.</p>

<p>Naval Escort for Fishing: Since its establishment, the Shanghai Fish Market has been very concerned about the interests of fishermen. In order to protect the safety of fishermen and increase fish production, it submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry to forward to the Navy Department yesterday, requesting the dispatch of warships to escort fishing. The original text is as follows: "Regarding the matter of petitioning, the fishing administration scope of the market is of utmost importance to the protection of fishing. Now that the Fishing Protection Office has been abolished, it is insufficient to maintain protection without borrowing the power of the fleet. It is most appropriate for the gunboats of the Ning-class fleet of the First Fleet of the Navy Department to protect fishing. It is requested that your ministry consult the Navy Department and order the Coast Guard Command of the First Fleet to designate the gunboats for the specific purpose of protecting fishing. Respectfully submitted for your review and approval. Respectfully submitted to Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, General Manager Wang Xiaolai, Deputy General Managers Zhu Kaiguan, Sun Guchen."</p>

<p>Preparation Process: Mr. Yao Huanzhou, the current chief technician of the market and former member of the preparatory committee, yesterday published the preparation process as follows: "During the term of Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry, there was a plan to develop the fishing industry, open fishing ports, and build fish markets. Minister Chen continued to follow Minister Kong's original intention and regarded the development of the fishing industry and the establishment of fish markets as one of the urgent industries to be improved. In October of the 23rd year, Hou Zhaohai, Zhang Zhuzun, and others were sent to Japan to investigate the organization of fish markets, so as to prepare for the establishment of a fish distribution agency. Shanghai is an international and national important market, with four major cities standing on three sides. Coastal ships and land transportation are concentrated here. The products of the whole country are discharged in this area. Therefore, it is proposed to establish a fish market in Shanghai as a national pioneer. By January of the 23rd year, this plan and estimate were submitted to the Executive Yuan and approved by the Central Political Conference. It was decided to be jointly operated by the government and merchants. In February, Yu Kaizhan, Xu Tinghu, Hou Zhaohai, Yao Huanzhou, Feng Limin, and other seven people were appointed as members of the preparatory committee to establish the Shanghai Fish Market Preparatory Committee on Sichuan Road. The preparatory committee appointed Zhang Zhuzun, Wang Chong, Wang Defa, Shen Zutong, and others as design committee members to actively proceed in accordance with the plan approved by the Central Political Conference. It took 22 months. The plenary meeting of all committee members was held for six times, and the Standing Committee for 116 times. The first estimated budget of the market, which was submitted to and approved by the Central Political Conference, was a total of 1,671,000 yuan. Based on the principle of joint government-merchant operation, since the recruitment of commercial shares was difficult and because the site of the Pujiang Bureau was leased, the original land purchase fee of 500,000 yuan was deleted. The Ministry of Industry submitted a request to the Central Political Conference to reduce it to 1 million yuan, of which 500,000 yuan was paid by the national treasury, and the remaining 500,000 yuan was invested by merchants. By March of this year, Minister Wu and Mr. Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Kui Yanfang, Lin Kanghou, Zhu Kaiguan, and Sun Guchen decided after repeated discussions that the continued fixed expenses of 1 million yuan were really insufficient. After the government and merchants reviewed the results, Minister Wu submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to increase the previously determined budget from 1 million yuan to 1.2 million yuan, with the principle that the government and merchants would each invest half. Commercial shares were recruited for 300,000 yuan first, and the Ministry of Industry would subsidize 600,000 yuan. The amount insufficient for commercial shares would be subsidized by the Ministry of Industry. As for the site, the newly filled land of the Pujiang Bureau, Dinghai Island, the current site of the market, was leased. It was chosen for its wide river surface and suitable water depth. Ships with a draft of about 20 feet can dock at will, regardless of high or low tide. After a long period of consultation and personnel mediation, the decision was finally made. However, the rent is high, with a value of more than 700 yuan per mu per year, totaling 47 mu and 6 fen, and an annual rent of more than 30,000 yuan must be paid. By April of this year, the founding meeting was established, and it can be opened today."</p>

<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that smuggling has recently become increasingly rampant. Almost all vagrants of a certain country scattered in various places regard smuggling as their profession. As a result, the scope of smuggling has been expanding day by day. The financial authorities regard this issue as increasingly serious, and have repeatedly discussed with all relevant parties to formulate effective measures to thoroughly curb smuggling, maintain tax revenue, and stabilize commerce. A national anti-smuggling headquarters is now planned to be established to oversee anti-smuggling matters, with branch offices to be widely established in various parts of Guangzhou to strictly crack down on smuggling and curb the smuggling trend. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance authorities have telegraphed the Guangdong Provincial authorities to seek their consent and have appointed Tang Hai'an, the Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, to go south as soon as possible to meet with the Guangdong authorities to negotiate specific measures. After receiving the order, Tang has scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 13th aboard the President Jackson of the Da Lai Company, heading to Hong Kong and then to Guangdong to discuss all matters.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Yu Shunqing Reports on the Discovery of Oil Wells: Abundant Oil in the Wells, Locals Use it for Salt Production; Chemical Tests Show It Also Contains Potassium, Sodium, and Iodine <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Yu Shunqing, a standing committee member of the National Coal Production and Sales Federation in this city, believes that Sichuan province has abundant oil resources, readily available everywhere. It is regrettable that Chinese people do not know how to exploit them, resulting in the waste of resources. In order to promote domestic oil and prevent financial leakage, he has specially united with both political and business circles to organize the Puli Oil Company and actively carry out operations. In addition to spending days running around seeking support from all sides, Yu also sent letters yesterday reporting on the discovery of oil wells in Sichuan province. Excerpts from his original text are as follows: "Since our country wants to seek national prosperity and strength, and improve social welfare, we must devote ourselves to production. Moreover, looking at the success of Russia's Five-Year Plan, its booming production has amazed countries all over the world. Modern</p>
<p>Scientific progress requires the use of machinery for any production undertaking. Therefore, the uses of iron and coal are extensive and significant. Furthermore, since the invention of airplanes and the popularity of automobiles, factories and ships also compete to use engines. As a result, the need for petroleum surpasses that of coal. Although our country has wide coal-producing areas, most rely on native methods of mining, resulting in high prices and low production, which provides an opportunity for foreign coal to enter. Shunqing, though not talented, once organized the Puli Coal Company, dedicated to circulating domestic coal. He also initiated the National Coal Production and Sales Federation with prominent figures in Shanghai, appealing loudly, hoping to work with gentlemen in the country to promote it. Remembering that the supply of coal and oil completely depends on imported goods, he was always concerned and puzzled. Recently, he heard that in the Zigong area of Sichuan, in addition to extracting salt water from salt wells, a kind of oily substance is produced. After analysis and chemical use,</p>
<p>It is petroleum. Hearing this, he was overjoyed and immediately prepared travel expenses to Sichuan. Regardless of the hardships, he happily packed his bags and set off, personally going to Zigong for on-the-spot investigation. Thanks to the hospitality of local people, they told me everything and gave me samples of analyzed well oil and various brines to take back to Shanghai for formal chemical testing. Now, I present my findings to all of you, hoping for your guidance. The only well I saw dug was a hundred zhang deep, and the brine was inexhaustible. Each unit could produce twenty catties of salt. When the well water is first drawn, it is all oily, light in quality, and combustible. The locals use it for lighting lamps and call it well oil. After the oil is exhausted, it becomes brine, clear in color, turning yellow after three hours. The locals call it yellow water. There is also gas discovered in the well, which the locals use</p>
<p>Connect pipes to ignite the fire, like the Shanghai gas lamps, to boil brine for salt. The locals call it well water. If you dig to two hundred zhang, you must pass through hard rock layers. Each dan of brine can produce more than forty catties of salt, and the color is either black or grayish-white. The locals call it black water. In the Dawenbao area, there is another type of rock formation. The extraction method is to first pour clear water into the well and then extract it. The quality is very salty, and each dan can produce eighty catties of salt. The locals call it salt rock water. When boiling, they all use gas to connect pipes for burning. The situation is similar in Gongjing, fifteen li away from Zigong, but salt rock has not yet been discovered. The locals rely on manual labor to dig wells. If they dig to three hundred and fifty zhang or three hundred and twenty zhang, red rock is found below. The soil is loose, similar to the surface soil. Geologists call it the boundary between the Triassic and Permian periods. An American gentleman once investigated the area and said that if wells are dug to four hundred zhang or below, kerosene can be extracted. Its</p>
<p>Abundant oil reserves, can be extracted without end. Someone once proposed a plan to initiate exploitation, but it failed to raise funds, and the proposal was shelved. Upon inquiry, the salt water was analyzed by Mr. Tan Shoutian, Director of the Central Geological Survey, and technician Jin Kaiying eighteen years ago. In addition to potassium and sodium, iodine was found. If a method can be devised to extract these two substances, it would also be a great source of profit. Shunqing is old and unable to do anything. I dare to express my sincerity, hoping that gentlemen and young people in the country will jointly fulfill this great wish, exploit this inexhaustible source of profit, wash away the shame of relying entirely on imported goods, and elevate our country to prosperity and strength. This is what I pray for fervently. The results of the chemical testing by the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau's Industrial Chemistry Testing Institute, Testing Form No. 930, are recorded on the left."</p>

<p>Wanlei Ya Sa Di, Chairman of the Philippine Foreign Affairs Committee, accompanied by Kuang Yaokun of the Institute of International Studies, went to Nanjing a few days ago to pay respects to our central authorities. Having completed his business, he returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. Speaking to a reporter from the Central News Agency, he said that his trip was extremely pleasant, and he deeply felt that China's construction had made rapid progress. All its buildings are magnificent and impressive. He highly praised the grandeur of Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum project, which combines beauty and solemnity. Because the Chinese government lacks publicity, he did not know beforehand that China's capital had developed so rapidly. Sun Yat-sen engaged in revolution and single-handedly created the Republic of China. His achievements are extremely admirable. While in Nanjing, he discussed with Foreign Minister Zhang and Minister Wu about developing Sino-Philippine trade and other issues. China's trade with the United States used to rank first, but has since dropped to fifth. Efforts should be made to develop international trade, he said. It is reported that Mr. Ya, accompanied by Kuang Yaokun, will still go to Hangzhou for sightseeing on the afternoon of the 10th, return to Shanghai on the evening of the 11th, and return to the Philippines on the President Jackson of the Da Lai Company on the 12th.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government, in order to reorganize Zhejiang's finances and unify local public bonds, specially obtained approval from the central government to issue 60 million yuan of the 25th Year Zhejiang Provincial Reorganization Public Bonds. In addition to the 55 million yuan needed to reorganize old debts, there is still a surplus of 5 million yuan. Cheng Yuanfan, Director of the Zhejiang Finance Department, has come to Shanghai several times to negotiate with banking circles, intending to pledge the remaining bond amount to borrow cash. Although banking circles have expressed acceptance of the principle of borrowing, no concrete decision has yet been made. After Director Cheng returned to Hangzhou, he continued to negotiate with the Hangzhou branches of the China and Communications Banks, intending to reduce the loan amount and pledge 1.4 million yuan of the new public bonds at a 60% discount to obtain 840,000 yuan to meet urgent needs.

<h3 id="e94">Germany Tightens Trade Controls, Chinese Goods Linger in German Ports, Exporters Request Assistance from the International Trade Bureau to Cope with the Planned Sino-German Trade Payment Method <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Shenshi News Agency reports that China's exports to Germany mainly include eggs and egg products, peanuts, casings, bristles, lace, tablecloths, etc. However, since Germany implemented exchange controls, the impact on China's export trade with Germany has been profound. Because Germany's trade controls are very strict, the German government does not allow the proceeds from goods exported from China to Germany to be repatriated, but limits it to local consumption. With the permission of the German government, real estate can be purchased in Germany. If German goods are to be purchased back, three times the original value of the goods must be paid. Through the above three measures, Germany strictly restricts the outflow of cash, causing China's exports to Germany to be unable to recover payment for goods, which has become a thorny issue for Chinese exporters to Germany, making it impossible to develop. Therefore, Shanghai Kaiji Trading Company and other exporters to Germany have requested the International Trade Bureau to find ways to provide relief. The bureau is doing its best to provide assistance in order to maintain the past prosperity of trade with Germany. It is now planned to first unite importers and exporters who have trade relations with Germany and implement local purchasing through transfer or substitution methods as a temporary remedy. They will also contact each other and notify export trading firms dealing with Germany that they can consult with the bureau on this issue in the future.</p>

If five years have passed since the date the right to claim could be exercised and no claim has been made, in accordance with the provisions of Article 126 of the Civil Code, it should be considered that the right to claim has expired due to the statute of limitations, and any claim made after five years can be rejected.

<p>Since the assassination of tobacco magnate Wu Tingsheng in Xuchang at the end of last year, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Ningbo Compatriot Association in Shanghai have successively telegraphed President Chiang Kai-shek, requesting him to order the apprehension of the murderer. Now, the Wu family, fearing that the injustice will remain unresolved after nearly half a year since Wu's assassination, has sent another letter to the Ningbo Compatriot Association in Shanghai requesting assistance. Upon receiving the letter, the association has scheduled a standing committee meeting for the afternoon of the 13th to discuss the matter specifically. The letter is excerpted below: "Respectfully, We recently received a letter from Wu Ding, a member of the family of the late director Wu Tingsheng, stating that they are deeply grateful for your association's previous telegram to President Chiang requesting him to order the apprehension of the murderer in the case of my late husband, Tingsheng, being assassinated. However, after several months, the murderer has still not been apprehended. We fear that if this continues, the injustice will never be resolved. We earnestly request your further assistance." In addition, Executive Committee members Wu Zhihao and Chen Zhong also submitted letters with the same request.

<p>The Shanghai County's rice stem borer control campaign involved a meeting of district heads convened by the county government, which decided to promote properly managed rice seedlings. The method involves arranging the rice paddies in a square shape, with a four-meter perimeter without restrictions, and leaving walkways on both sides for egg removal. All egg masses found on the rice seedlings should be picked off and burned. All rice straw owned by farmers should be used as soon as possible, and any leftovers should be burned immediately to kill the stem borers lurking inside. Those that must be retained should improve storage methods to prevent the borers from escaping. Now that the planting season has arrived, each district has notified township chiefs to inform each Bao chief to promote trial implementation.</p>

<p>At this time of year, when spring and summer intersect, the weather alternates between cold and hot. According to reports from the municipal agricultural authorities, there were initial hopes for good harvests of spring crops such as soybeans, wheat, and rapeseed. However, due to this abnormal weather, the prospects for a good harvest are uncertain. Currently, the wheat and rapeseed are in the flowering stage, so the impact is still small. If the weather remains the same for another week, then a poor spring harvest will be inevitable. Furthermore, according to news from the grain industry, rice prices in Shanghai have been declining in recent days due to sluggish sales from out-of-town merchants, leading to an increase in rice stocks. In previous years, rice prices would inevitably rise during this lean season, but this year, they are contracting, which shows how deeply the economic downturn is affecting society. This has a serious impact on the agricultural economy.</p>

<p>Fu Yu, a policeman from the Hengfeng Road Police Station of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, a 33-year-old native of Shandong, was ordered by his superior on February 8th to deliver official documents to the headquarters by bicycle and return to the station. While passing the entrance of the Xihai Grand Theater at Xinzha Road and Chibang Road, a British-owned Route 10 public bus, number 15041, driven by Wang Jinfang, came speeding towards him. Due to reckless driving, Wang knocked down and ran over Officer Fu, killing him. After an investigation by the relevant patrol station and the Hengfeng Road Police Station, the patrol station surprisingly did not prosecute Wang Jinfang. However, Director Cai of the Municipal Police Department believed that this matter involved a life, and that Wang Jinfang's culpability should be investigated according to the law in order to ensure fairness. Therefore, he appointed the department's legal counsel, lawyer Zhan Jifeng, as the agent for Officer Fu's family to file a private prosecution with the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court, with an attached civil suit seeking compensation of 2,800 yuan in national currency for damages. As a result of the trial, Wang Jinfang was sentenced to five months in prison, and the civil suit was transferred to the Civil Division. Wang, dissatisfied with the judgment, hired a lawyer to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. Lawyer Zhan also appeared in court on behalf of the family. The Second Branch of the High Court recently announced its judgment, rejecting Wang Jinfang's appeal.</p>

They have now completed their work and returned to Shanghai. A reporter from the Continental News visited the Yang residence yesterday afternoon (the 9th) for an interview. Mr. Yang eagerly recounted his experiences, saying that the beautiful scenery and wonders witnessed were beyond words. The journey involved one or two dangerous incidents, but the life experience and accomplishments were extremely worthwhile. The two brothers, after bidding farewell to their friends in Shanghai last summer, went to Dajianlu. The ones from New York are slightly different in shape from the Tibetans, and their reproductive abilities are declining significantly. These people are quite suspicious of travelers. The team stayed until the danger had passed before leaving. Then they returned to Dajianlu and advanced to the Minya Konka (transliteration) mountain range, where the scenery was excellent. They stayed there for three months, engaging in collecting. Many beasts were seen, among which the blue sheep were abundant, with more than 2,000 heads seen. Their footprints extended over a hundred square miles, making it one of the richest animal-producing areas in western China. One of the most interesting discoveries of the team was a lake at a high altitude of 12,000 feet, with cliffs as high as 20,000 feet next to it. The beauty of the scene was truly rare. Harden Brock also accompanied them, and he stayed with the team for several months, achieving much. The entire team set off in August, arriving in Dajianlu in western Sichuan in October. After completing their base, they climbed over mountains and crossed ridges, traveling for five days, arriving at Tongyu (transliteration) northeast of Dajian (transliteration), which is on the upper reaches of the Tong River (transliteration). No specimen collectors had ever been there, so the team was almost the first to arrive. They stayed for more than ten days, gaining much. Then they heard that bandits were gathering 20 miles away, very close, and could be seen with binoculars. The team had very few bullets, but decided to stay and help the people resist the bandits, because if they retreated for fear of danger, they would be looked down upon by the people. The residents of this place were said to be descendants of those who had been expelled from Tibet a hundred years ago, and were rarely seen. It was difficult to find food there, and the team members often relied on blue sheep to fill their stomachs. Afterwards, because they had obtained enough, they went to the Muli (transliteration) territory, and then met General Yang Ren'an (transliteration) of the Nanjing government, who allowed them to travel together in the Yi district. The team stayed on the border of Sichuan and Yunnan for a long time. On the way, they heard rumors of bandit troubles around Dajianlu, so they were worried about the many valuable specimens stored there. Then they returned there, packed everything up, and prepared to return. They suddenly abandoned some luggage. This trip obtained many bird and animal specimens, which will be shipped to the California Academy of Biological Sciences in a few days. Some of them will be given to Mr. Poth of San Francisco. Mr. Yang also brought back two Tibetan dogs and two monkeys.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Tenants of Yuanjili, Tangshan Road, File Lawsuit Requesting Rent Reduction; Court Adjourns Hearing the Previous Day; Judgment Scheduled for the 14th <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The houses in the Yuanjili area of Tangshan Road in Hongkou were built by the Real Estate Department of the Siming Bank. Recently, 102 tenants, including Zhou Yansheng, have jointly hired three lawyers, Jiang Baoli, Jiang Pingfan, and Peng Xuehai, to file a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the First Special Court against Cheng Lansun, the legal representative of the Siming Bank, requesting a rent reduction. The reasons stated were roughly as follows: Since the "January 28th" Incident, Shanghai's economy has declined to an extreme point, and real estate values ​​everywhere have naturally decreased. Therefore, many landlords have voluntarily reduced rents. The defendant's houses not only have not been reduced, but have even increased rents by one or two yuan per month. The plaintiffs are suffering, so they specifically request legal assistance to reduce the monthly rent by 40% from August 1935 to July of this year, based on the original rent. According to Article 44 of the Civil Code, parties may petition the court to increase or decrease rent based on fluctuations in the market value of real estate. The court approved the petition. The previous day, Judge Huang Risheng heard the case in Civil Court Twelve. The courtroom was filled with tenants who came to observe the proceedings, while the defendant's side also hired lawyer Dai Xuzhai to defend them, refusing to reduce the rent. Judge Huang ordered the arguments in the case to be closed and scheduled the judgment for the 14th.</p>

<p>At 2:40 AM the previous morning, the home of Wang Tiecheng, the principal of Dalu School, located at No. 4, Lane 59, Jiaxing Road, was broken into. The intruder brandished a handgun, forbidding anyone to make a sound. They stole gold watches and rings, and foreign currency worth more than 200 yuan before fleeing. After an investigation by Inspector Bao Shuji of the Hongkou Patrol Station, Sun Hengji, a Jiangbei native who used to work as a chauffeur for Wang's family, was apprehended at No. 196 Meihua Road as a suspect. He was taken to the patrol station and transferred to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the Public Works Department stated that Sun was fired for stealing gasoline. Before the robbery, he had visited Wang's home to scout it out, and knew that there were nearly 3,000 yuan in legal tender stored in a dragon safe. He then conspired with accomplices to rob it, and asked where the money was placed during the robbery. They searched and robbed, but found nothing. Since the victim has not arrived, a postponement is requested. When questioned, Sun Hengji pleaded guilty. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

They went and arrested her, seizing 195 yuan in legal tender. They discovered that the main hub was located inside No. 199 Chengdu Road.

The Public Works Department filed a public indictment according to Article 257, Section 2 of the Criminal Code, for the crime of selling the drug "red pills." The representative lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that the case was quite complicated, and that the main suspect was still on the run, so he asked for an extension to investigate further.

<h3 id="e121">Inland River Steamboat Association: Sends Telegram to Zhejiang Construction Department Requesting Exemption from Fuel Storage <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Inland River Steamboat Association of Shanghai has received reports from members operating in Zhejiang province that the Wuxing Second District Ship Management Office is forcing shipping companies to store fuel. Yesterday, the association sent a telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department requesting consideration of the shipping companies' difficulties and exemption from fuel storage. The original telegram is as follows: "Respectfully to Wu Junjian, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department, Hangzhou: Recently, we have received reports from members operating in Zhejiang province stating that the Wuxing Zhejiang Second District Ship Management Office recently drafted seven measures for shipping companies in the Lake District to store fuel and attached a guarantee form, forcing shipping companies to sign it. They also claimed that it was being handled according to your instructions, requiring reporting within three days. At a time when the shipping industry is declining, the Ship Management Office is not thinking about ways to protect shipping companies, but is instead arbitrarily drafting impractical fuel storage measures, using administrative power and falsely using your name to force shipping companies to sign, which is a stain on official integrity. We are reporting this and requesting relief. The issue of shipping companies storing fuel was originally for emergency needs. However, since the opening of highways in various parts of the two Zhejiang provinces, the inland river shipping industry has declined drastically. In recent months, the prices of both coal and diesel fuel have soared. Shipping companies are still buying fuel on credit for daily needs. How can they have the ability to store more? We sent a telegram to you in April reporting our difficulties, which was approved. However, the Inland River Shipping Industry Association believes that the inland river shipping environment is deteriorating daily, and there are still problems with the daily fuel requirements. We have the will to serve the country, but we are unable to store fuel. The Second District Shipping Office drafted measures to force shipping companies to sign. After reviewing the proposed measures, each of them increases the burden on shipping companies. Once implemented, it will be equivalent to cutting off the livelihood of our shipping industry. All members of the association are firmly opposed to the above storage measures. In this day and age when strong neighbors are pressing on the border and the country is in dire straits, caring for the people and honest governance are the urgent measures to save the country. There is no reason to disturb the people in order to prepare for national defense. The association believes that this matter concerns the survival of the industry, and that the actions of the Ship Management Office are harmful to the country and the people. For the sake of protecting your good reputation, we cannot remain silent. We respectfully report our business difficulties and hope that you will understand. This is in the public interest. Signed, Han Yimin, Chairman of the Shanghai Inland River Steamboat Association."</p>

<p>Similar Situation to Mei Hua Bank; Creditors Sue Manager for Fraud</p>
<p>The Yicheng Exchange Shop on Beijing Road was established in March of this year by Qiu Zuxian and others, with a capital of only a few thousand yuan. However, since its opening, business has been poor. Thus, it closed down on the evening of April 9th, just over 30 days after opening. For a circulating financial exchange shop to open for only a little over a month and then close is a rare occurrence, similar to the case of the Mei Hua Bank on Jiujiang Road closing just 19 days after opening. Recently, 22 creditors of the exchange shop, including Hong Bingquan, Yu Rongxing, Chen Laisheng, Xu Zhizhu, and Chen Yaoting, stated that the shop's actions were actually a sham to absorb deposits and take all of the plaintiffs' hard-earned money, which constituted fraud and theft. They jointly hired lawyers to file a lawsuit against the exchange shop's manager Qiu Zuxian, assistant manager Wu Zhengyun, and accountant Jiang Bochuan, in accordance with Article 339 of the Criminal Code, with the First Special Court. In addition to requesting severe punishment according to the law, they also filed a civil suit requesting the recovery of deposits totaling 9,719 yuan. The previous afternoon, the court summoned the defendants. Only Qiu Zuxian, represented by lawyer Lin Yingqing, appeared in court, requesting a postponement. The court ordered the case to be rescheduled for further questioning.</p>

Now that the industry has an association, this year's celebration will be organized and prepared by the industry association.

<p>The New Star Pharmaceutical has expanded its business recently. The original location on Hankou Road was insufficient, so it moved to the Parker Road Building on Jing'an Temple Road yesterday.

In addition to serving tea and refreshments, Mr. Yao gave each guest a bottle of bottled Golden Dragon Supreme Oil, manufactured by the pharmacy's Supreme Factory, and a copy of the latest magnum opus, "The New Star Encyclopedia", in order to thank the guests for their kindness. At the same time, the pharmacy's newly established Tou Shi Department and the expanded Mail Order Department offered special prices and half-price items, and prepared a large number of exquisite gifts to increase the interest of buyers during the opening period, so customers were very crowded. The pharmaceutical, Leteling, for gonorrhea, various skin diseases, and eczema, as well as the newly launched four new drugs, Fuxing, Tongnaiping, etc., were welcomed by customers. This is because Mr. Yao Junzhi, the manager of the pharmacy, has been managing it effectively and has an outstanding reputation. The various medicines managed and issued by the pharmacy have the special effect of saving lives and helping the world, which is why. In the following is a recent photo of Yao Junzhi.</p>

<p>Since the implementation of the New Civil Procedure Law on July 1 last year, although there have been many publications and treatises in the market, there are still few that focus on the interpretation of the righteous principles.

Moreover, I work for a certain company and earn more than 20 yuan a month, which is enough to maintain a small family. How could I know that my wife, He, would not care at all and would borrow indiscriminately, even pawning and mortgaging everything? That was still the limit. Unexpectedly, recently a change has occurred, and she has become acquainted with Xu Qingfa. She does not return day or night, as if they were husband and wife. Seeing this situation, I am ashamed and have no interest in being a human being. Being in this world is just suffering. In addition, yesterday my wife even deliberately made a scene at the company, demanding money, causing a great disturbance and damaging my reputation. My colleagues laughed at me. After a brief argument, I was humiliated by her. Resentful, I had nowhere to vent my anger, so I had to drown myself to end my remaining life. If anyone finds my body, please provide a coffin for burial. I am wearing a thread-lined jacket and pants, black socks, and slightly broken leather shoes. There is a 20-cent auxiliary coin in my pocket. Please also notify the rescue bureau to pay attention. I would be grateful." Attached was a letter to his wife: "Wife Xuezhen, today I bid you farewell forever. See how you enjoy your life alone. How can you bear to treat your husband so ruthlessly? I have nothing more to say to you now, only to sacrifice my life before you. However, after my death, I want you to think about whether I have done anything wrong to you. You probably don't understand, and there is also your cousin. Since we have lived together, I believe I have not treated you badly. As for money, although it is not abundant, it is enough to support the family. You still say in front of others that your husband supports you. Alas, you are embarrassing me. What benefit is there to you? As the saying goes, 'Marry a dog, follow the dog; marry a pig, follow the pig.' You should have conjugal harmony. Even if you are dissatisfied, you can always get a divorce. Don't do such shameless things in secret. You also have to think about where to put your husband's face and how to face relatives and friends. What you have done, you still don't realize. You don't return day or night. I don't know what you are busy with. Everyone goes to shows, but no one is as shameless as you. For example, a few days ago, you told me you were going to your sister's place in Hongkou. I, as your husband, didn't stop you. How could I know your words were still lies, and you went to the Oriental Hotel with your lover? At that time, I couldn't sternly tell you why you didn't return. How can you be worthy of your husband in this respect? When you came back the next day, you were still being unreasonable, treating your husband as a fool, and advising you with kind words, considering our marriage, but you still wanted to quarrel with me, acting arrogantly. Aren't you clearly deceiving me? As the ancients said, 'Family scandals should not be made public.' I am your husband, and I don't want to tell others, but you have the nerve to say that having lovers in Shanghai is okay. Your neighbors and teachers can testify to this. According to you, there is no relationship. Still, I provide you with clothes and food. So heartless. No wonder your cousin scolded you as inhuman. You said the more you are controlled, the more you are like this. Now I will let you go. Staying in the world is just anger. Let you be free and unrestrained. As for the company, since I can sacrifice my life today, I will not spare anything else. I have already sent another letter. You can take all the items and sell them as you please. This is the end for us. No more words. Finished. Written by your deceased husband, Gong Yaoqing." After receiving the letter, the branch notified the rescue bureau to order the rescue boats to pay attention to retrieving the body from the river.</p>

<h3 id="e144">General Manager of Meiya Silk Weaving Factory Cai Shengbo Sued; Court Will Continue Hearing Today <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>After the government designated blue robes and black jackets as formal attire, they have been worn for weddings, funerals, and gatherings. Since the creation of group weddings, they have also been used as formal attire for the groom. As a result, silk and satin companies have been vying for business. The Meiya Silk Weaving Factory at No. 140 Tianjin Road and its branch store, Kai Li Silk and Satin Company at No. 765 Jing'an Temple Road, have taken advantage of the opportunity to advertise their production of formal attire, claiming that they have been approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. A certain Standard Silk and Satin Company, separated by a wall of profit, is also located at No. 763 Jing'an Temple Road, engaged in the same silk and satin business, and also making various formal attires. Due to business competition, they have ended up in litigation. The court held a hearing on this case a few days ago. The plaintiff is Lin Zhixiang, the owner of Standard Silk and Satin Company, and the defendants are Cai Shengbo, the general manager of Meiya Silk Weaving Factory and chairman of Kai Li Silk and Satin Company, and Gao Shiheng, the manager of Kai Li Company. According to the plaintiff's statement of reasons for the lawsuit, Li Li Company sells silk and satin and also makes formal attire. It once published an advertisement stating that it provides free production of the blue robe and black jacket standard formal attire approved by this association. Cai Shengbo and Gao Shiheng envied the plaintiff's business and damaged it by falsely accusing the plaintiff of counterfeiting and secretly presenting a request to the Social Affairs Bureau to stop it, attempting to obstruct the business. They then publicly hung the instructions obtained from the Bureau at the entrance of the Kai Li Company on Jing'an Temple Road. Under the instructions, they added an advertisement with the words "Purchase Meiya standard formal attire. Please pay attention to counterfeiting and shoddy goods masquerading as genuine." publicly damaging the plaintiff's reputation. The formal attire approved by the Social Affairs Bureau is based on silk-woven blue robes and black jackets as the standard. Any manufacturer can weave according to this standard. The Meiya Silk Factory and Kai Li Company operated by the defendants do not have the exclusive right to weave or produce them, and the term "Social Affairs Bureau approved standard formal attire" is not a special trademark. The defendants have no right to interfere with the plaintiff's advertisement for making "Social Affairs Bureau approved standard formal attire." Now, they have spread these words to the public, pointing fingers and damaging the reputation of the plaintiff, thus jointly committing the crime of defamation under the criminal law and filing a civil lawsuit requesting the court to order the defendants to publish an apology advertisement on the cover of the "Shen Bao" and "Xin Wen" newspapers. Judge Yang Qianchang is handling this case in the Criminal Division Two. The plaintiff has commissioned lawyers Zhu Chengxun and Xue Jiaqi to appear in court, while the defendant Gao Shiheng has appeared, and Cai Shengbo has not appeared due to other matters. The defendant has commissioned Chen Tingrui to appear and defend. According to the defendant's defense, the production of formal attire has been approved by the Social Affairs Bureau, and Meiya has been entrusted with handling it in Shanghai. It has been ordered that Meiya products can be used for all formal attire. Therefore, the plaintiff is deliberately interfering with the business and now filing a criminal lawsuit, which is unreasonable. During the statement, the plaintiff gesticulated and lost the dignity of the court. The judge reprimanded him to correct his behavior. The plaintiff replied that the standard formal attire is the blue robe and black jacket, and the Social Affairs Bureau has approved that it is a silk fabric. Any manufacturer can produce it according to this standard. How can the defendant monopolize it? Moreover, they spread words publicly, deliberately hanging the Social Affairs Bureau's note on the doorway and adding annotations, which clearly defames the plaintiff's reputation and constitutes a crime. Judge Yang then said that both parties are legitimate merchants. This is a trivial matter and should be resolved out of court. The hearing was adjourned to next Monday (today).</p>

The first special zone has He'an Elementary School, the second special zone has Tonghuan Elementary School, District 1 of South Shanghai has Jingye and Shihua, and Zhabei District has Jirong Elementary School, all of which can compete for the top two or four places. The male shot put champion in Yangjing District is undoubtedly theirs. The talents in other districts are relatively uneven.</p>

The referee was Liu Chunshu. Taiping had strong players such as Wanxianghua, Feng Nianhan, and Chen Dejie, making them a strong team. Yizhong relied on its even talent distribution and gave it their all. The result was a 2-2 draw. The competition between the two sides was fierce. It was a pity that the rainy and slippery field made the battle even more exciting. Yizhong now has six wins and two draws, with a total of 14 points, winning the Foot Group championship.

<p>— Li Huitang</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM on May 2nd, the French postal ship, the Aramis, slowly moved and sailed south to Wusongkou. Our team members all took a deep breath of fresh air, expressing a comfortable pleasure. This was not because we disliked Shanghai and wanted to leave as soon as possible. However, we were indeed a bit tired of the ball games and the ball atmosphere. It was naturally a joyful thing to leave quickly and go to the sea to breathe some fresh air. Half a month ago, the World Games football preliminary selection was held in Hong Kong. At the same time, our Hong Kong team was rushing to finish the annual competition. As a result, there were overlapping matches, with four or five matches every week. After the selection results were out, our spirits were exhausted, our muscles were fatigued, and our interest had cooled to zero. We really had a "seeing the ball makes us sick" mentality. Then, we were ordered by the National Sports Association to come to Shanghai to perform in the exhibition matches. We felt tired and exhausted, but how could we refuse the association's summons?</p>
<p>As a tired army running to Shanghai to meet new horses, although we were confident that we had done our best and worked hard to the extreme, we knew that it was impossible for us to bring out our full skills in this environment. Really, in these matches, no one had a brilliant performance. This abnormal display was something we expected. Therefore, we all hope that people who love us will not be too harsh on our dissatisfaction this time.</p>
<p>The most unfortunate thing was that on April 28th, our eleven pairs of hairy legs were too disappointing and could not defeat the West League team, causing thousands of fans who "loved us deeply and hoped for the best" to go home disappointed. This is the biggest regret of our trip to Shanghai. In fact, the outcome of a ball game is the most unpredictable thing. According to my experience, first-class teams in England often lose to third-class teams. Moreover, the fighting power of the West League team is not much better than ours. Although winning or losing is a natural principle, one or two games are not certain. Unless the two teams play ten or eight times, the goddess of luck will not easily play tricks and prove who is superior and who is inferior.</p>
<p>Because of this defeat, it caused a storm in the city. The criticisms in the newspapers and the criticisms of the fans were varied, giving us a great lesson and a deep impression. This has to be said to be a great gift from this failure. I often feel that the criticisms of our country's press or fans are often biased or inappropriate. They really attach too much importance to the words "win or lose." When they win the ball, no matter how bad the performance is, the whole team will surely win praise, saying it like a cascade of flowers. When they lose the ball, the opposite is true. They don't investigate the reasons for the failure at all, and they don't understand the difficulties of the failure at all. In fact, the same square toes, the same circle, and the same blood, who doesn't want to perform their best when they get to the stadium? We have a vital stake in it, who would willingly abandon themselves? However, sometimes "if the horse doesn't go forward, it's not because it dares to go backward." It is only because of special reasons that the performance is not satisfactory. Regarding this review, I want to use the space here to briefly explain the truth.</p>
<p>A newspaper said that "when I kicked the penalty kick, I didn't understand the rules after hitting the post, and I added another kick." This is too wronged. If I don't even understand this simple rule, then what qualifications do I have to be a captain and referee? The fact is that the ball bounced back from the post too quickly, so I couldn't avoid it, so I touched it and fouled. How could I have the intentional intention to add another kick? This kind of record is untrue and is proof of the reporter's superficial knowledge, which is an obstacle to the development of sports.</p>
<p>There is also an unknown "Old He Jun" who earnestly gave me instructions and enlightenment in his report. I always welcome people's sincere advice to me, but what he said also needs to be explained. He said that the performance of the center back line in the first half was not good, and the captain turned a blind eye in the second half and did not replace others. In fact, that day was a British game and was not allowed to be replaced. This is where he didn't know the truth and wasted his argument. He also said that "the old generals Cao Guicheng and Li Guowei can no longer be used." Cao and Li's performance that day was indeed abnormal, but every player has a day of abnormality, so how can we observe the superiority or inferiority with one or two games and make a definite decision? Besides, the word "old general" can still be said to be in Cao Guizhen, but Li Guowei is only twenty-three this year, so is he considered old? Guowei's average performance in Hong Kong is quite good. Both Chinese and Western newspapers believe that he is the best left center back. "It should not be used again in the future." This sentence may be inappropriate. In short, I said above that everyone felt too tired this time, and the interest was not strong. Although every game did not give up the heart of eating, it was only a forced effort to support the spirit and exhaustion. It is most unfair to draw a conclusion under these circumstances. There is also the "×× Weekly" that has always attacked me, who puts the failure of Dao Jue on my personal head and adds other kinds of demeaning remarks, saying that I am old and useless, and should not be selected. It should have everything, attacking with all its strength. I have no common hatred with them, and I don't know why. Fortunately, this kind of black newspaper is just to win the sympathy of the lower class, and there is no value. In fact, a penalty kick, if you can't kick it in, it won't necessarily affect the final situation of winning or losing. But it's a common thing to not be able to kick a penalty kick, and it's not worth making a fuss about it. The best shooters in the world sometimes lose their feet, not to mention our lower-level generations. As for "old" and "degeneration," I am not a superman, and this is something that will come sooner or later. How can I be so stupid? It is only a pity that they attack so hard, but the station does not work. The association turned a deaf ear and put the responsibility of the captain on my shoulders. Then how can I be too old, or not at all useful? I still remember that in the last performance match in Hong Kong, I was blessed to score five goals, and I got good criticisms from newspapers and fans. Today is only half a month away, and degeneration will never come so quickly. I insist on my own self-confidence, saying that I am not too old or not at all useless.</p>
<p>If I were not sick, I would have published this article to the public to show the truth of the facts. I did not intend to vent my anger or defend the team members. In fact, we have exhausted our blood, spirit and energy, and we have a clear conscience. People's arguments are about right and wrong and the victory or defeat of the ball game. How can we care so much? Our ten-day stay in Shanghai has given us the impression that the people of Shanghai have the same mentality as their compatriots in other places. What is this mentality? This is "the victory or defeat of the ball game, love and hate follow," and the word "victory" is too heavily biased. Therefore, we are not at all pessimistic about our ball game failure. We see that the criticisms of the newspapers and the arguments of the people are inappropriate, and that the support of the fans is not in accordance with justice, and then we feel the hopelessness of our country's sports future.</p>

<p>School Investigation</p>
<h3 id="e176">An Overview of the German School in Shanghai (4) <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>The focus of the school's moral education is to cultivate national spirit. The first step in cultivating national spirit is to implement national character teaching, that is, to use materials needed by the people of the country as much as possible in language, literature, history, and geography. At the same time, the school often reminds children of the development and success of their nation, so that children can develop a noble national spirit in a subtle way. For example, in this decision, Germany announced the abandonment of the Locarno Treaty and sent troops to station in the Rhineland demilitarized zone. The history and geography teachers of the school used slide projectors to show the children about the geography, customs, and human feelings of the Rhine River and nearby areas so that these children in foreign countries could also understand the situation of their motherland and make their patriotism arise spontaneously.</p>
<p>Another method used by the school to cultivate national spirit is to train children's physique. A healthy physique is the foundation of national spirit. Although the school does not have perfect gymnasium facilities, it actively trains children's physique. The school usually has five classes every morning, from 8:30 to 12:30. There are no formal lessons for each grade in the afternoon, but students of all grades must take turns coming to school to participate in fitness exercises. Boys in each grade take turns coming to school three times in the afternoon every week to exercise their physique: girls also have to come to school in the same way, but one or two of the fitness exercises are changed to needlework. Other group fitness activities, such as sports meets, excursions, and mountain climbing, are also often held.</p>
<p>6. Hitler Youth League</p>
<p>German youth training has been quite famous in the past. Since Hitler came to power, the work of youth training has been carried out more actively. Hitler has now concentrated the national youth training work under the guidance of the government to train uncivilized citizens for the country. The Hitler Youth League is one of the ways in German youth training. The German School in Shanghai also has the organization of the Hitler Youth League. Now I will briefly introduce the organization and activities of the Hitler Youth League.</p>
<p>The Hitler Youth League can be divided into two groups according to the age of the children: the first group is the young children's team, which children from ten to fourteen years old join; the second group is the youth team, which young people from fifteen to eighteen years old join. On the girls' side, there are also similar two teams. The first team is the girls' team, which girls from ten to fourteen years old join; the first team is the Federal German Girls' Team, which girls from fifteen to twenty-one years old join. The organization of the group is like this: There are fifteen entries called a squad, fifty people called a company, one hundred and fifty people called a battalion, six hundred people called a district team, and a certain number of district teams can form a district team, and a certain number of district teams can form a regiment. There are currently twenty-five Hitler Youth League regiments in Germany; the number of members in each regiment is about 75,000 for men and an equal number for women. The Youth League of the German School in Shanghai is also directly under the command of Hitter. The regiment's flag, uniform, etc. are all stipulated by Hitler.</p>
<p>The purpose of Hitler's Youth League training is to develop a healthy personality and a sense of duty. Therefore, the training of the Youth League includes fitness exercises, boxing, shooting, field camping, reconnaissance, hiking, mountain climbing, etc. Special attention is also paid to spiritual training. It is automatic for German male and female students to join the Hitler Youth League, not reluctant. However, once you join, you must accept strict training. Last summer, Hitler summoned the domestic and foreign youth groups in Germany to hold centralized training; the Youth League of the German School in Shanghai also sent representatives to participate in the country.

<h3 id="e177">The Goat's Fault <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— (Kang Dun)</p>
<p>There is a popular folk tale in Abyssinia:</p>
<p>One day, a pair of leopards went out and left their cub in the cave. An elephant broke into the leopard's den, killed the cub, and savored its tender flesh. The leopard's neighbor went to report:</p>
<p>"Your beloved son has been killed."</p>
<p>"Who killed it?"</p>
<p>"An elephant killed it."</p>
<p>"Ah! An elephant? An elephant wouldn't kill my cub. It must have been that hateful goat that killed it."</p>
<p>"No, it was definitely an elephant."</p>
<p>"I'm telling you, it must have been the goat that killed my son, not anyone else." After saying this, it leapt up and devoured the goat to vent its hatred for the death of its cub.</p>
<p>Originally, the leopard knew that its son had been killed by the elephant, but because it was not a match for the giant elephant, it had to vent its anger on the goat. This is the origin of the idiom "the goat's fault" (It is the foul of the goats).</p>
<p>The current Abyssinia has been defeated. But this time, they will not blame the goat for fearing the giant elephant. After all, they fought to the death with the giant elephant, and although they were defeated, they were still honorable.</p>
<h3 id="e178">30th Anniversary of Joining the Army <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Chou Cheng</p>
<p>In the 32nd year of Emperor Guangxu's reign during the Qing Dynasty, Su Fu Jichunjiang, in view of the fact that the practice of recruiting soldiers was too deeply ingrained and unreliable, started conscription in the counties of Su, Song, and Tai. In addition to assigning graduates of the Land Army and Military Preparatory Schools to set up conscription bureaus in various counties of the three prefectures, he also ordered local gentry to carefully draft methods for serving, waiting, and encourage them to persuade. Xu stipulated that if conscripts had important matters at home, acquaintances would help each other to avoid worries at home. After retirement, they would be invited to the upper seat at public banquets to show respect. He also specially composed a farewell song, referring to the example of scholars entering the academy, publicly preparing colorful flags and drums, and the public group school would welcome and send them to the camp. The song said: "Great citizens of the East and West, people like to be soldiers, one son is a soldier, six relatives are honored, walk and send them with joy. There are many good men in Jiangsu, they should enlist together, the military uniform is glorious, and it is a credit to their parents and fame. Last year, the military power shone in Beiyang, and Hejian was used as a drill ground. The two armies fought like facing an enemy, and the dragon flag fluttered in the morning sun. Military officials from various countries came one after another, and the progress was surprising. Newspapers praised them, and the names of the soldiers were spread. Since ancient times, Wu has had many heroes, who regard death as if returning home. Those who start out in the army are noble, and their ambitions will not be violated. You see Zhang Yao and Sun Shao Xiang, how glorious their battle achievements are. If they return with meritorious service in other countries in the future, their bronze statues will stand tall. Soldiers, soldiers, don't waste your time, listen to my conscription song. Soldiers, farmers, industry and commerce are all equal, let's all hold weapons together. The forest of guns and the rain of bullets are not enough to fear, victory lies in harmony, and the heroism in our hearts is now revealed, to protect our beautiful rivers and mountains." Therefore, for a time, the sons of gentry and tribute students broke the old saying that "good iron is not made into nails, and good men are not soldiers," and enlisted one after another, totaling more than 1,500 people. At that time, I was studying at Jiaxing Xiushui School, so I asked for leave to go to Suzhou, pretended to be a native of Wuxian County, and enlisted. In the same year, I was admitted to the Land Army Training School out of 80 people out of 1,500 people, and taught two subjects of academics. After graduation, I was assigned to the first and second standard generals. In the Xinhai Restoration, I followed Governor Cheng Xuelou to attack Ning, and it has been 30 years since then. Among these 1,500 people, many died in battle and of illness, and those who are still alive are scattered in all directions and have changed careers. Now the government is promoting the conscription system again. We can be called the first group of conscripts. Therefore, I initiated the 30th anniversary of joining the army on May 3rd, which was held at Huqiu in Suzhou. Forty people reported, and they talked about their experiences in the past 30 years, which was quite emotional. Several of them had not met for more than 20 years, and they almost did not recognize each other.</p>

<p>The Suzhou Canglangting Academy of Fine Arts was founded by Wu Zishen and Yan Wenbiao. Graduates from previous sessions have reached hundreds of people and have all achieved considerable positions in the art world. In terms of both teaching and management within the school, it can be said to be one of the best in the country's public and private art schools. Therefore, every year when new students are recruited, people from all provinces of the country can come from afar. Recently, students from the Chinese and Western painting departments of the school have each organized a painting society and started exhibitions. The painting society organized by the Western painting department is named Nanyuan. More than a dozen male and female members each brought their school works and went to Beiping to hold an exhibition. A list of exhibits was found and excerpted as follows: Quan Yuxiu's self-portrait, Li Zongjin's looking up at Canglangting and Ping's recent shadow, Li Zheng's Song Chushi's self-portrait, Du Xueli's bottle, Fan Xianying's child, Xu Dawei's vegetable flavor old man, Hua Shirong's self-portrait of Dou Antinous, Sun Baochang's ancient forest autumn temple by the river, Min Wanshi's vegetables, Fei Yifu's silver people's Sheep King Temple (according to the Sheep King Temple, it is the second courtyard of the Academy of Fine Arts. Jun's accommodation here, writing day and night, took up to five months. Before the exhibition in the school, hundreds of people came to visit every day). After arriving in Beiping, it was displayed in the Taimiao. Within three days, thousands of people from the Beiping art world went to visit every day, and there was almost a sense of congestion. Reporters from various Beiping newspapers went to take many photos and published them on the front page, which was truly an unprecedented event. It is heard that after the closing ceremony, the members still have a week's stay in Tianjin. They went to scenic spots in the old capital to sketch. Recently, the Zhuanyou Painting Society, organized by the Chinese painting department, has also been ready. Members such as Wu Zhongying, Li Yanjiang, Dai Xi, and Yan Yucai are all outstanding talents of the time. The landscape and flower paintings they have made have all been paid for; and in their spare time, they have also made 120 pages of fan paintings. They will hold an exhibition at the Suzhou Public Association in a few days, and I think there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>

<p>Chapter One: Sipping Tea and Engaging in Conversation by a Night Window Listening to Rain, Plucking Branches to Admire Their Beauty as Fragrance Flows Through the Flower Lane</p>
<p>Guoqi felt extremely sorry about this matter, thinking that he had kept the person sitting for a while without even offering a cup of hot tea. To make matters worse, he had even splashed mud on them when they left. In any case, he had to return the visit tomorrow, whether it was sunny or raining; he could not miss this opportunity. With this idea in mind, he glanced at the house across the way, where his mother had already retired, and he turned off the lamp to sleep, planning to finish his homework early the next morning so he could leave class early and meet Pingshan. When he woke up in the morning, expecting it to be another rainy day, he was still reluctant to get out of bed. But as he rolled over and sat up, he opened his eyes and saw a golden ray of sunlight on the glass window. The gloom of the past several days vanished completely as he opened his eyes. He washed up, drank tea, and bid farewell to his mother before hurrying out the door. Right next door was someone's vegetable garden, enclosed by earthen walls on two sides and a fence on the other. Many vegetables were planted on the ground, and along the fence were planted a hundred or so slender bamboo stalks. After being soaked by the rain, the bamboo appeared especially verdant in the bright sunlight. He didn't know what kind of small birds they were, but seven or eight of them were flying and chirping on the bamboo branches. In the vegetable garden, a few inches of chives were sparsely emerging, topped with tiny yellow flowers. With just these embellishments, the impression of early spring was quite profound. This was the same road that Guoqi passed every day, but he usually didn't find anything particularly delightful about it. Now, illuminated by the gentle spring light, it felt exceptionally pleasing to the eye. In particular, the southeast wind blowing from the bamboo tips caressed his face without feeling cold at all. This made the air in his chest feel very comfortable to breathe. Although Nanjing City was so grand, on this day, the north of the city was entirely bamboo groves and vegetable and wheat fields. Even though the south of the city was densely populated, ponds and vegetable gardens were everywhere. Guoqi lived in the west of the city, where the streets and alleys were filled with old-style architecture, with roof tiles without eaves covering low, crumbling lime walls. Between every two or three houses, there were always two or three patches of vegetable gardens or a clump of wild bamboo. The narrow alleys were paved with cobblestones, arranged in no particular pattern. In the cracks between the cobblestones or at the foot of the walls, a patch of wild grass leaves or a ring of moss protruded. There were few pedestrians in the alleys, except for women washing clothes in the wild ponds, carrying their laundry baskets. Or peddlers carrying baskets, carrying a load of green vegetables, passing by quickly. With few pedestrians, the sounds of people were also very quiet. Instead, the clatter of silk weaving machines echoed from the workshops, carrying the sound of the looms through the clear sky. Guoqi thought of the lines, "Listening to spring rain overnight in a small building, selling apricot blossoms in a deep lane in the morning," and wondered, if there were a flower seller passing by here at this moment, no matter what kind of flower it was, it would be very poetic.

<p>Short Story</p>
<h3 id="e182">Street Violinist <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Fei</p>
<p>It was a twilight evening in late spring, with dense rain falling silently. The metropolis seemed dead, all worldly affairs temporarily at rest.</p>
<p>The surroundings in the room were silent. The damp air was oppressive, making it difficult to breathe. I casually picked up a book to read, but I set it aside without even finishing half a page. I walked to the window and pushed open the glass pane, intending to look out at the streets in the drizzling rain, but the wind blew on my body and the rain splattered on my face. A chilling, dismal feeling crept into my heart like a small brown snake.</p>
<p>Although it was already late spring, the weather seemed stuck in early spring, so cold and gloomy that it was hard to believe it was the season of bright spring and blooming flowers.</p>
<p>I closed the window, went back in, and threw my heavy body into a recliner. An nameless sorrow gripped my heart, making me feel the emptiness and impermanence of life, the meaninglessness and superfluity of everything in the world...</p>
<p>As I was silently tracing the past, savoring the present, and longing for the future, a melancholic melody drifted from the streets in the distance. The sounds, one after another, section after section, entered my ears, causing my nerves to be keenly stimulated, feeling that the trembling tone was telling the misery of life. The sound gradually came closer and became clearer. So I stood up and opened the window, leaning on the windowsill to listen, forgetting the cold, forgetting the rainy night. I only heard the mournful, sorrowful tune, like the cry of apes in a valley, like a widow weeping, sending it over. From each prolonged and trembling cadence, I seemed to see a haggard old man standing under a dim street lamp, or squatting in the dark streets and alleys like a ghost, dragging a lonely shadow, trying to use this single string to express his boundless sorrow, grief, humiliation, anger...</p>
<p>The sound passed, gradually fading into the black night of wind and rain. Only then did I look up in disappointment at the silent street, seeing only the dim streetlights illuminating the wide, flat road. These buildings cast many shadows on the ground, making it seem as if they had gone through a storm under the dim yellow light.</p>
<p>Returning inside, I realized that my clothes and hair were all wet.</p>
<p>That night, I lay in bed, unable to fall asleep, tossing and turning. Although I buried my head deep in the covers and tried to shut out all thoughts to calm my nerves, it didn't work. That melancholic melody, that thin, sallow face, kept circling and appearing in my mind. A feeling of sadness and desolation kept crawling in my heart, like a poisonous snake coiling around my weathered, wounded soul, causing it to ache.</p>
<p>I didn't close my eyes all night, just staring blankly at the ceiling, searching for unrelated memories, until the glass window showed a glimmer of white light.</p>
<p>Since that night, I have heard that mournful, sorrowful tune every night, echoing in my ears. And since that night, I have begun to suffer from severe insomnia.</p>

<p>— Qiu Jie</p>
<p>When someone possesses something I don't, it's reasonable for me to borrow it from them and return it when I have it myself. However, there are two things that can only be demanded from others and cannot be borrowed. If you say you're borrowing, you will definitely be hated by the other party. What are these two things? They are "tea" and "fire." If you say you're borrowing "tea" (especially from women), it implies flirtatiousness, and borrowing "fire" is taboo in social superstition. The most ridiculous thing is that people clearly spend betrothal gifts and go through all sorts of complicated procedures to marry a woman, but society commonly calls it "demanding a wife." This use of the word "demand" is extremely illogical! Moreover, the women who are married are all young and beautiful, so how can they be called "old women"? It's truly unbelievable!</p>

<p>— Ji Yijie</p>
<p>The famous painter Fei Xiaolou was a person from the Jiaqing and Daoguang periods of the Qing Dynasty. His painted beauties are still praised to this day. People all know that Xiaolou was a famous painter of beauties, but they don't know that his portraits were incredibly lifelike and exquisite, possessing the magic of surpassing nature.</p>
<p>Legend has it that during the Daoguang period of the former Qing Dynasty, there was an uncle of the Emperor who was blind in one eye. He repeatedly hired painters to paint his portrait, but none satisfied him because all the painters simply copied what they saw, failing to conceal his defect. Later, Xiaolou was invited. Xiaolou discreetly learned of the situation and specially painted a picture of a barber cleaning ears. The person in the picture (the Emperor Daoguang's uncle) had one eye slightly closed, as if unable to bear the tickling sensation. It was both realistic and concealed his blindness. The Emperor Daoguang's uncle praised him greatly and gave him generous gifts. Painters like Xiaolou can be said to have come up with an original idea, and his "reputation in painting" has a reason.</p>

<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>It is correct that tofu, known as Chengzhaojun tofu, was invented by Liu An, the King of Huainan. However, besides being called shuru, tofu also has the aliases laiqi and liqi. The name laiqi can be found in "Yu Ji's Writings": "In local language, tofu is called laiqi." The name liqi can be found in Lu You's poem: "Wipe the plate and quickly spread it out; wash the pot and cook liqi." Most likely, laiqi and liqi are simply variations of the same pronunciation! As for the reason why Zhu Xi didn't eat tofu, besides what Chengzhaojun said, it is rumored that Zhu Xi's family sold tofu, and he must have eaten too much of it and didn't want to eat it anymore.</p>

<p>— Yu Qiong</p>
<p>What will our finances be like during wartime? What kind of measures should be implemented? This has become a problem that must be considered now. Here, I intend to briefly discuss an outline.</p>
<p>What impact will war have on the financial markets? In short, it is the destruction of international and domestic credit. Our problem lies in how to respond to this situation after the destruction of domestic and foreign credit. After the outbreak of war, the first to be affected will undoubtedly be the foreign exchange and securities markets. Once the opportunity arises, foreign capital will inevitably withdraw from our country on a large scale. Foreign property, regardless of whether it is stocks, bonds, real estate, or other investments, will be disposed of and taken back. Foreign banks will inevitably transfer their active assets back to their home countries. As for their stocks, bonds, and discounted notes, they will either be dumped on the market or directly transferred to domestic banks for foreign exchange discounting. The movement of foreign capital will become the first layer of heavy pressure on our foreign exchange and securities markets. Domestically, some capital will inevitably try to escape at the opportunity. Merchants will sell securities, withdraw deposits, and turn to national banks to purchase foreign exchange. The flight of domestic capital will become the second layer of heavy pressure on the foreign exchange and securities markets. Under these circumstances, the securities market will inevitably experience severe turmoil first, and banks will be unable to immediately recover loans to meet customer withdrawals, inevitably leading to widespread insolvency. Money shops will collapse one after another due to banks tightening credit and recalling loans with no place to turn around. National banks will also face an extraordinary crisis, because foreign property is intended to be disposed of and taken back, and some domestic capital is also intended to escape at the opportunity. Foreign property will quickly turn to the Big Three banks to purchase foreign exchange, and people will withdraw deposits from banks and follow suit to the Big Three banks to exchange for foreign exchange. The Big Three's ability to stabilize foreign exchange will face an extraordinary test. Under the current monetary system—the foreign exchange standard—the scramble to purchase foreign exchange is, in fact, no different from a general bank run. Foreign exchange reserves can be exhausted in an instant. Credit panic will become unmanageable. The key to suppressing the turmoil lies in this point.</p>
<p>At this time, the problems are: first, to avoid disruption of the financial markets; second, to ensure the integrity of credit institutions; and third, to preserve foreign exchange reserves. The emergency measures are: first, to avoid disruption of the financial markets, the only way is to order the exchanges to immediately close; second, to ensure the integrity of credit institutions, the only way is to order banks and all monetary institutions to temporarily suspend payments; third, to preserve foreign exchange reserves, the only way is to temporarily implement foreign exchange controls. These three points are the first step in dealing with wartime finance. The closure of the exchanges is an inevitable result of major changes in securities prices. This may happen even before the government orders it, and it will be forced to close first. However, government bonds are the mainstay of exchange trading, and government credit is directly reflected by the exchange. If the exchange is allowed to be forced to close on its own, government credit will inevitably leave a bad impression on the people's minds first. Therefore, the government should take precautions and anticipate that the situation may not be completely controllable. It is better to order it to close in advance than to resort to it as a last resort after the situation has become unmanageable. As for announcing the suspension of payments, the purpose is to ensure the integrity of credit institutions. It should not be a reactive measure, and should not be implemented until banks and money shops have collapsed one after another and the market has become blocked. This problem is also closely related to preserving foreign exchange reserves. If people are allowed to withdraw and deposit freely, they will immediately turn to the Central Bank to purchase foreign exchange after depositing in ordinary banks, or even discount foreign exchange to the Big Three with deposit slips and passbooks from various banks, which is no different from forcing the Big Three to pay foreign exchange with deposits from various banks, and the loss of foreign exchange will be accelerated. Therefore, announcing the suspension of payments is also a measure to preserve foreign exchange reserves. As for foreign exchange controls, it is, in fact, no different from suspending convertibility. Under the current monetary system, although people cannot exchange legal tender for cash at banks, they can exchange it for foreign exchange according to the law, and the Big Three are legally responsible for unlimited supply. If Chinese and foreigners are allowed to freely purchase foreign exchange, given the huge assets of foreigners in China and the weak confidence of the Chinese people, foreign exchange reserves can be completely lost in an instant. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to implement foreign exchange controls immediately after the outbreak of war. This measure can also indirectly curb the bank run on ordinary banks. If foreign exchange is restricted, people cannot purchase foreign exchange after withdrawing deposits, and what they withdraw is all legal tender, not cash, which cannot be used for hoarding. The bank run can naturally be indirectly affected and its momentum slightly curbed.</p>
<p>The above measures are only to passively control the chaotic situation, like using gravity to suppress the turbulent surface of the water so that its interior can be clarified. However, the closure of the exchanges, the suspension of debt payments, and the implementation of foreign exchange controls will inevitably result in the stagnation of economic activity. Wartime is precisely the time to exert national strength to fight for survival, and the stagnation of economic activity is an absolutely undesirable phenomenon. Because the stagnation of economic activity will make it impossible to exert national strength. Therefore, the next step is to implement proactive policies to promote the stagnant economic institutions, and this is our next step.</p>
<p>The next step can be discussed from five aspects: first, the government should use its strength to support credit institutions so that they can resume activity; second, the government should fully support industry and commerce so that they can adapt to the extraordinary environment of wartime; third, the government should use new credit to alleviate the deflationary situation after ordinary credit measures are lost in wartime; fourth, the government should fully suppress factors that disrupt the circulation of legal tender and ensure the circulation of legal tender; fifth, implement the mobilization of foreign debt to maintain foreign exchange stability. These are discussed separately as follows.</p>
<p>Since the banks have already been ordered to suspend payments, all debts are blocked. The longer the suspension lasts, the more overdue debt will accumulate. Under this kind of panic and contraction, it will be difficult to smoothly recover loans. If the government does not expand credit and directly provide assistance, the banks will have no day to reopen. In the money shop industry, there is usually no sufficient preparation for economic turnover, and they rely on interbank credit and short-term loans from banks. Since the banks are tightening credit at the top, and the money shops are on guard against each other, this method of credit transfer no longer exists, and it goes without saying that they cannot reopen. Banks and money shops are the hubs of economic activity. If they cannot resume activity, there is no hope of loosening the economic stagnation. Therefore, during the suspension of payments, the government should immediately provide substantial assistance to banks and money shops. The method can be divided into two points: first, the government can use the British method during the European War, entrusting the Big Three to directly loan to the banks, with the purpose of enabling each bank to meet its immediate debts. This measure is to enable each bank to settle its debts and resume business. Second, the Big Three should handle the discounting and rediscounting of various commercial bills with sufficient funds. The purpose of this measure is to enable the frozen funds of ordinary banks and money shops due to the suspension of payments to have room for activity. After the suspension of payments, the bills received by each company are frozen in an invisible manner. If the Big Three can substantially absorb these bills and replace them with their own credit, the frozen debts can continue to circulate, and the increase in active funds will greatly help to activate the market and settle debts. Britain also used this as one of its important measures during the war. The government directly advances money to the banks, and the frozen funds of bank bills can also be restored through the Big Three's full acceptance of discounting. The banks' active functions can gradually recover.</p>
<p>Second, the government should support the activities of industry and commerce. This point is very important, because industry and commerce are the source of materials in wartime, and all economic measures should aim to enable industry and commerce to fully exert their effectiveness. The activity of industry and commerce depends on funds. Some businesses are indeed operated by the government with its own funds, but private enterprises are still important. Regarding the working capital issue of private enterprises, we advocate that the government should follow the British method during the European War and directly guarantee the industrial and commercial loans of banks and money shops. In wartime, the political situation is uncertain, and even if banks and money shops have sufficient funds, they may not dare to lend them out as much as possible. This is probably unavoidable. If the government can directly provide credit guarantees so that banks and money shops can release funds without the risk of freezing, bank funds can be directly used to support production. This measure is also to enable the government's credit assistance to the financial sector to extend its effect to industry and commerce. Otherwise, even if the government rescues the financial sector, the financial sector will not dare to rescue industry and commerce, and the government's credit assistance to the financial sector will be meaningless. To enable the financial sector to fully utilize the credit granted by the government to support industry and commerce, it is absolutely necessary for the government to provide credit guarantees to the industrial sector.</p>
<p>Third, the government should prepare to use new credit to alleviate the shortage of small change at the beginning of the war. This point is also very important for our country. Because our currency organization is very complicated. After the implementation of the legal tender policy, although cash cannot be circulated legally, some of it is still scattered among the people. In some places, real money still occupies a dominant position. Once a credit crisis occurs, silver coins will be completely hoarded, and even general copper coins will disappear. It is expected that some unscrupulous merchants will transport currency to the inland to purchase copper coins and real money. The fact that Wuhan concentrated cash in the 16th year of the Republic of China can be used as a reference. Real money was quickly hoarded, small change was lacking, transactions were hindered, and some places even became dead markets. It is absolutely necessary to use new credit to stabilize the market. During the European War, Britain, France, and Germany all issued a large number of small-denomination banknotes at the beginning of the war, with the purpose of facilitating market financing and avoiding the stagnation of economic turnover. This point should be adopted by us. Moreover, after the outbreak of war, economic activity will inevitably shift to the interior. In the inland areas, small-denomination credit small change is especially necessary to cope with this extraordinary situation.</p>
<p>Fourth, sanction factors that disrupt the value of legal tender and ensure the circulation of legal tender. This point is also particularly important in our country. This can be discussed from the following points: first, the issue of the secret circulation of cash. The concentration of cash in our country has not been completely completed. Once a war breaks out, it will first be hoarded and disappear from the market, and even copper coins cannot be exchanged; then it will appear on the black market, becoming a powerful factor in undermining the circulation of legal tender. Because the cash of the people cannot be hoarded forever, after a considerable period of time, it will inevitably appear on the market, and black market transactions will arise from this. The United States during the Civil War and Europe during the European War all had similar experiences. Even in countries with developed credit systems, such as Britain, the secret circulation of silver coins cannot be explicitly prohibited. The experience of the disturbance of prices and harm to the circulation of legal tender after the emergence of cash on the black market after Wuhan concentrated cash in the 16th year of the Republic of China is also a lesson for us. Therefore, preventing cash and real money from appearing on the black market is a necessary measure to consolidate the circulation of legal tender. Second, the issue of using foreign exchange as a means of payment. During the currency panic in various countries during the European War, the use of foreign exchange for transactions became a common practice. As a result, foreign exchange soared due to increased demand, and local paper money became useless due to lack of use. During the period when Wuhan concentrated cash in the 16th year of the Republic of China, merchants competed to use Shanghai exchange and Shanghai banknotes as payment tools. As a result, Shanghai exchange soared to over 6,000 taels in a short period of time, and Wuhan regarded Central Bank notes as semi-legal tender and fell to the point where they could not be circulated in a short period of time. This historical fact deserves our attention. Prohibiting foreign exchange as a means of payment is probably a necessary method to consolidate the circulation of legal tender.</p>
<p>Fifth, concentrate debt and maintain foreign exchange stability. This point is extremely important and extremely difficult. Since foreign exchange controls have been implemented, foreign exchange cannot be locked up for a long time and will eventually be gradually opened up. How to maintain stability after opening up is our problem. During the European War, various countries successively implemented the mobilization of foreign debt to cope with foreign exchange. First, the state organized banks to try to buy it, then levied special taxes to force the people to hand it over voluntarily, and finally, it became a common practice to forcibly concentrate all foreign debt and sell it abroad by the government. Forcible concentration of foreign debt is probably an absolutely necessary measure for us. Judging from the effectiveness of our people, the people will never voluntarily offer it unless it is enforced. However, it is extremely difficult to stabilize foreign exchange with the strength of one country in wartime. The key point is to obtain international cooperation, but the forcible concentration of foreign debt is still one of the decisive measures we should take.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the above five points is to sanction disruptive factors in a passive way, and to support the activities of credit institutions with the power of the government in an active way, so as to achieve the goal of exerting national strength in wartime. The main point is the latter. There are still many other problems, and what is described here is only the main points. Finally, let us discuss the preparatory work that should be done before the war.</p>
<p>There are three points that we want to propose: first, cash in the hands of the people should be concentrated as soon as possible; second, the supply sources of currency should be unified as soon as possible; third, financial institutions should be adjusted as soon as possible. It cannot be denied that cash has not been completely concentrated. Once a war breaks out, the cash remaining in the hands of the people is expected to become a powerful factor in disrupting the market. In order to prevent the occurrence of black market transactions and the disruption of prices, cash concentration is absolutely necessary. Second, the unification of currency supply sources probably means the centralization of issuance. The banknotes in the market are still very complicated, and the banknotes of local banks still have a certain status in the interior. Once a war breaks out, due to the psychological effects of the people, price differences will inevitably occur in the market, and prices will be disrupted as a result. In order to prevent the emergence of this situation of price differences due to currency differences, the first step is to completely unify currency issuance. Once the currency is unified, there is no room for comparison or choice, and there will be no price differences. Third, the adjustment of financial institutions is even more important at present, and the problem is also very complicated. We only want to propose three points: first, the Central Bank system in the form of a joint venture of the Big Three is definitely not suitable for the extraordinary situation of wartime. The central agency for controlling finance should be organized and established as soon as possible. Second, the current bank organization with numerous small banks is definitely not suitable for the extraordinary situation of wartime. How to promote its concentration and merger is a problem that should be studied at present. Third, after the outbreak of war, the position of Shanghai will probably be difficult to determine. How to enable the government to choose the right financial path for the whole country after leaving Shanghai is one of the most noteworthy issues at present. These three points are the central issues for adjusting the banking system, and I hope to present them for consideration by domestic talents.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Evaluation of Chinese Hui Societies <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Bu Yu Zhi</p>
<p>Before entering the topic, three points should be clarified:</p>
<p>The scope of this article is only to analyze and evaluate the "facts" of Hui societies. Opinions on papers and writings on Hui societies will not be involved unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>The author has lived abroad for many years and has not been able to personally investigate the recent trends of Hui societies in China. The recent descriptions of the Hui society system have also not been read one by one. The materials in this article are only based on known writings.</p>
<p>Due to limited space, the various methods of Hui societies cannot be explained in detail. Here, I would like to introduce two monographs for readers' reference.</p>
<p>A. Wang Zongpei's "Hui Societies of China," published by the Shanghai China Cooperative Society in 1931.</p>
<p>B. Yang Ximeng's "A Study of Chinese Hui Societies" (Collection No. 1 of the Institute of Social Sciences, National Central Research Institute), published by the Commercial Press in 1925.</p>
<p>I. Importance of "Hui Societies" in China and Abroad</p>
<p>Starting from the early years of the Republic of China, when Mr. Xue Xiangzhou and a few friends advocated the German Schulze-Delitzsch cooperative banking system, and in 1919 founded the "Shanghai National Cooperative Savings Bank," and in 1920 published the "Common People's Weekly" to promote cooperative theory, this was the beginning of cooperative theory and movement in China.</p>
<p>In 1921, a major drought spread across five northern provinces, and the fields were full of corpses. Chinese and foreign talents tried to provide relief. After the disaster relief in 1921, there was still more than two or three million yuan left. Therefore, in 1922, the "China-Foreign Joint Relief and Disaster Relief General Association" was established. This was the hub of the rural credit cooperation movement in China.</p>
<p>In 1928, Jiangsu Province established a farmers' bank and also established a "Cooperative Guidance Staff Training Institute," which also made important contributions to the credit cooperation movement. In addition, there were also individuals and groups who either engaged in translation and writing (such as Mr. Lou Tongsun Zishu De), or conducted theoretical research and reference experiments (such as the Shanghai China Cooperative Society). The number was very large. In 1931, the Ministry of Industry further formulated the "Provisional Regulations for Rural Cooperation."</p>
<p>In this cooperative movement, an event was linked and aroused, which was very important, that is, the attention of a group of people to an old system in China—Hui societies. In a few years, articles on Hui societies were often seen in several important magazines published in Shanghai, Peiping, Hangzhou, etc. In 1931, Wang Zongpei even published a book titled "Hui Societies of China," which was the beginning of monographs on Hui societies in China. Today, the Commercial Press has recently published a new book titled "Research on Chinese Hui Societies," which also contributes a lot of materials.</p>
<p>From the surface, Hui societies are just a small game among the people. In a few years, there have been so many papers and two monographs, which seems to be making a fuss over a trifle. However, from the perspective of the role, efficiency, and impact of Hui societies, it seems that Chinese people have paid too little attention to it.</p>
<p>As far as the author knows, 157 years ago (1778 AD, the 43rd year of Qianlong), the French missionaries in Beijing wrote "Memoires Ccocenant les Chinese," and its 16th volume (pages 384-387) described the system of Chinese Hui societies. Also, 55 years ago (1880 AD, the 6th year of Guangxu), Father Lebouca, who had lived in China for a long time, wrote "Asscciaons de la Chine," which introduced Hui societies (pages 108-125) in more detail; and praised the simple method and strong friendship of Hui societies. Also, 44 years ago (1891 AD, the 17th year of Guangxu), Simon, who had served as a consul in China for a long time and understood and loved China very much, wrote "La Cite chinoisse," which introduced Hui societies in more detail, and attached seven diagrams at the end of the book to illustrate various Hui styles, believing that Hui societies were a wonderful product of mutual assistance among the people.</p>
<p>After the opening of the University of Paris, Professor of Economics Simiand instructed the author to give a lecture on Hui societies. During the lecture, teachers and students discussed it for a long time. Among the questions, the three that deserve our attention the most are:</p>
<p>Has the origin of Hui societies been solved? The author's answer is that the origin has not been solved, but based on reasonable speculation, it has at least a thousand years of history. (According to Wang's book and the author's speculation, it has been more than a thousand years)</p>
<p>Why are Hui societies so popular in China, but there are no explicit regulations in Chinese legislation? The answer is: Chinese society values morality over law, which is the opposite of Western society, and cites Confucius's "Lead them with virtue, regulate them with propriety, and they will have a sense of shame and moreover be reformed; lead them with government regulations and restrain them with penalties, and the people will avoid wrong-doing but will have no sense of shame" as the basis. It also cites the views of Professor Mauss of the French Academy of Social Sciences: "Eastern countries" are ruled by moral customs; Western countries are ruled by law (see his outline of sociology described in "Annales Sociologigues" 1934 Paris Alcan)</p>
<p>Hui societies are so popular in China and so effective. How many Hui society groups are there each year? How many people participate? How much is borrowed from Hui societies? Is the purpose of Hui societies more for production or for consumption? If it is more for consumption, what kind of consumption is more? China does not have statistics on the above points? In addition to answering with speculation, the author can only say that China does not yet have statistics.</p>
<p>As for the contribution of the Hui society system to modern culture, everyone undoubtedly affirmed two points:</p>
<p>Contribution to the "History of Cooperation": Economists believe that credit cooperation is a modern thing. If Hui societies are recognized as a kind of borrowing cooperation, then this conclusion should be broken.</p>
<p>Contribution to the "Cooperative System": Although cooperationism has been advocated by scholars, supported by the government, and promoted by political parties, it is now inevitably declining. The failure of cooperative societies is often heard. As for the Hui society system, scholars do not pay attention to it, and the government does not ask about it, but it can naturally circulate among the people for thousands of years. There must be its characteristics in this. This feature can undoubtedly contribute to cooperativists.</p>
<p>Regarding the three questions about Hui societies: the origin of Hui societies, whether Hui societies should have a legislative basis, and the statistics of Hui societies, the author does not list them again, but hopes that we can conduct further research and discussion to resolve the doubts of some people.</p>
<p>As for the characteristics of Hui societies, we cannot deny the fact. Several years ago, regarding Hui societies, many people in China advocated changing Hui societies to cooperation. The author talked to several professors at the University of Paris, and they also advocated changing cooperation to Hui societies. In the future, will it be "cooperationizing Hui societies, or will it be Hui societyizing cooperation"? This is a question worth discussing by everyone.</p>
<p>If everyone can finish reading this article and understand the value of Hui societies, I think this question will not be difficult to solve. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e194">Finance: Gold Exchange Public Notes Cleared Today <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The public notes of the Gold Exchange for May were cleared yesterday due to the school holiday being postponed by one day. The short sellers who settled their accounts included 21 notes from Yongfengheng and 7 notes from Tongtaichang. The longs, who should have been collected by Shengyuanshui today, were settled at 1,127 yuan. The notes for this month have temporarily come to an end.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Call Loan Interest Rate Returns to 8% <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and banks were closed for a regular holiday. The market situation was idle, and the market price remained stable. The call loan interest rate was 8% in the morning and afternoon, down 1% from the previous day. The transaction volume of call loan bills was over 2.8 million yuan in the morning session, with over 200,000 yuan in new transactions. The afternoon session saw transactions of just over 10,000 yuan. The transaction volume of the Small General Association was over 300,000 yuan. The receipts and settlements of money shops' foreign public notes are suspected to be over 45 million yuan. Remittances from various routes totaled over 900,000 yuan. The situation of auxiliary coins: Guangdong small foreign coins were sold in the morning session, with 10,000 jiao completed. The afternoon session saw 5,000 jiao completed. The black market price was still 12 jiao and 3 fen, equivalent to 3,400 yuan of legal tender.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Securities: Weak Maintaining Power of the Bulls; Government Bonds Gradually Decline Last Week; Initial Drop of Half a Yuan to One Yuan and Five Jiao <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>From May 4th to 9th, the Shanghai Commercial Securities Exchange experienced a very brief and hurried struggle to rise, which suddenly turned weak and gradually declined. This was just a rebound caused by excessive increases in the past. Sellers from the north were surging, and No. 35 also began to decline from beginning to end. Most of the large bulls had some local fluctuations, but most were still holding on. However, the maintaining power seemed to be gradually exhausted. There were actual entries, but the number was small. Actual buyers were quite willing to raise prices to maintain their large interests with the sacrifice of a few. The sellers did not exert their pressure because their shorts were suppressed. Every time the longs needed them, they lowered the price to let them out. This kind of attitude of both sides showed a difference between reality and emptiness. Therefore, the future of the market price depends on whether the longs' pulling up work continues uninterrupted. Otherwise, it is inevitable that it will be fleeting. Last week, at the beginning of Monday, it initially inherited the remaining power of the previous week. Type A once saw a new high price of 68 yuan and 9 jiao and a half. But as the selling pressure increased, it was forced to decline, and the trend suddenly became chaotic, with different opinions. On Tuesday and Wednesday, trading was slightly clearer, and market prices were weak, falling by about 3 or 4 jiao per day, with no flaws. On Thursday, the atmosphere was very strong, and some of the longs came out and added to their positions, which also caused the maintaining side to be slightly relaxed. Market prices declined throughout the day, from half a yuan to eight jiao. On Friday morning, the decline continued. In the afternoon, Nos. 10 and 47 and others bought in and raised prices once, so the final result showed a mixture of highs and lows. The market closed on Saturday, and the environment was brewing for change. Although there were many rumors, they were still chronic and would not cause major unrest for the time being. The bond market will also not be very active. As a result of a week of market prices, there was a consistent decline, ranging from half a yuan to one yuan and a half. Nos. 5 and 6 also fell by a small amount of two jiao. The total transaction volume was 21,134,500 yuan. The results of its rise and fall are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3 id="e197">North Goods: Sudden Increase in the Price of Tianjin Red Dates Due to Guangdong Merchants and Fruit Dealers' Purchases <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>According to a customer's letter, the price of Tianjin red dates has recently surged by one and a half yuan due to purchases by Guangdong merchants and fruit dealers, totaling six to seven thousand packages. This has further depleted existing stock. It is estimated that there are only five thousand packages currently in stock in Tianjin, and the market is expected to tighten further. Local market prices have also risen accordingly, and it is said that stock levels are very low, with miscellaneous goods even scarcer. For example, there are no more "Chicken Heart" red dates, and "Long Red" dates are in short supply, priced at approximately six and a half yuan. Ordinary Haozhou red dates are priced between eight and six and a half yuan, while Tianjin red dates vary from sixteen to nine yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Seafood: Over Supply of Arrowroot Flour <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The arrowroot flour market has been sluggish recently, with few transactions from Sichuan, Hubei, Beijing, and Hunan merchants. Only the local Tianjin area and inland regions have seen some trade, but in very small quantities. There is already an abundant supply of medium and high-grade goods, and the arrival of foreign goods is increasing daily, making the market feel even more saturated. Merchants are eager to sell off their stock, but there are few interested buyers, causing prices to decline. Yesterday, merchants sold Dutch goods at a flat price of six yuan for the top grade, fifteen yuan and twenty cents for "Man Gun," thirteen yuan for European products, twenty-one yuan for "Green Pagoda" No. 2 goods, ten yuan and eight cents for domestic Wenzhou No. 1 goods, ten yuan and four cents for No. 2 goods, and nine yuan and six cents for Japanese No. 1 goods. Market prices for all grades have fallen by sixty to seventy cents, or at least thirty to forty cents, compared to last week's prices. If there are bulk transactions, merchants are willing to make special concessions.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Increase in Stock of Foreign Sugar in This City (As of May 9th)</p>
<p>Totaling 406,858 pieces (including approximately 200,000 bags of "Five Rams White" sugar in the miscellaneous sugar category)</p>

<p>After Mr. Cheng Zhenzhenji, the general manager of the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Marketing Committee, came to Shanghai to plan the promotion of black tea from Qimen, Fuliang, and Zhide, negotiations with tea warehouses have been ongoing for many days. According to news from the warehouses, the matter has now been decided: Hong Yuan Yong, Zhong Xin Chang, Yong Xing Long, Ren De Yong, and Yuan Shuang Run, six tea warehouses will organize a black tea promotion office to accept black tea bills of lading, extract tea samples, and hand them over to the trading floor to handle as before. The draft contract is said to have been telegraphed to the Anhui government for review, and it can be implemented after formal approval.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Grains: White Japonica Rice Sales Relatively Active <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, No. 445 rice from various sources in Hexia (lower river areas) saw slightly more active sales of various types of white Japonica rice on the market, with prices remaining high. Medium-grade rice was slightly tight, while thin Indica rice was stable. White yuan retail prices softened slightly, with market conditions tightening by nearly ten cents, while shade yuan prices were stable. White yuan retail prices softened slightly, with market conditions tightening by nearly ten cents, while shade yuan prices were stable. Prices for various Indica and other grains did not fluctuate much.</p>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, over thirty-one hundred stones of goods from various gangs arrived. The market was sluggish and lacked vitality due to weak local sales. Orders from Tianjin and Dalian merchants totaled over a thousand packages. Prices for thin Japonica rice remained unchanged. Shadow yuan prices for Du Yang pointed rice were believed to have changed.</p>

<p>The trade in white lead sheets has been quite brisk recently. Battery factories, ordnance factories, cigarette factories, printing bureaus, and weighing scale factories, among others, have all been making purchases, leading to a high level of market activity. However, market inventories have become extremely scarce since the authorities began procuring supplies, leading to a situation where patterns such as No. 2 and No. 47 are nearly exhausted. Furthermore, due to high overseas prices, few dealers are willing to buy, resulting in limited imports. As a result, standard market prices are rising sharply due to the shortage of goods on the market. For example, No. 2 pattern is selling for 135 yuan per barrel, No. 3 for 132 yuan per barrel, No. 4 for 131 yuan per barrel, No. 5 for 130 yuan and 50 cents, No. 6 for 129 yuan, No. 7 for 129 yuan and 50 cents, and Nos. 8 and 5 are both selling for 128 yuan, No. 10 for 127 yuan and 50 cents, while pattern are selling for 120 yuan. Despite the fact that it is a Sunday, there were still 30 to 40 barrels being sold. It is said that battery factories are the biggest buyers.</p>

<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened with increases of two to four "bang yin" (British pounds). Trading was sluggish in the early morning. Old cotton was firm due to short covering by traders. Warehouse brokers sold May futures at 11.158 cents. New cotton saw a slight decline due to rain in the west. The eastern cotton region is in dire need of rain. Cotton merchants are indecisive, waiting for progress in Europe and the disposal of cotton loans. Closing was stable, with spot prices falling two "bang yin" and futures rising three "bang yin" to falling four "bang yin". British cotton spot prices fell 2 points, futures fell 1 point. Indian cotton was initially weak due to farmers' selling and long liquidations, but recovered due to purchases by a few European exporters, with the plain grade falling 0.5 to 1 rupee, Oomra falling 0.75 to a rupee, and Broach falling 1 to 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded to the left (May 9th telegram).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for Broach cotton for the 7th and 8th was 198.5 rupees, up 0.25 rupees from the previous day.</p>

<p>According to a report from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, tea exports in April that passed inspection and were approved for export totaled 3,172.53 metric tons, a decrease of 12,394.58 metric tons compared to the same month last year. It is noted that this month is the beginning of the new tea season, and normally inland tea merchants would transport large quantities of new tea to Shanghai to compete for sales overseas. However, recently, local tea warehouses have suspended trading and closed down in opposition to the unified control of tea transportation and sales in Anhui and Jiangxi, resulting in new tea being held up in the producing areas and unable to be transported, and the local tea market is in a state of stagnation. Therefore, the quantity of exports has decreased significantly. The following is a table showing the statistics of tea exports by country in April:</p>

<h3 id="e205">A Strong Stomach Eliminates All Diseases <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Li Fumin</p>
<p>Human life depends on nutrition for sustenance, and the organ that takes in and manufactures nutrition is the stomach. Therefore, a strong stomach leads to a healthy body, while a weak stomach leads to illness. This is because the adequacy of nutrition determines the strength of the body.</p>
<p>"Strong Stomach Essence" is a newly discovered medicine for strengthening the stomach in modern times. This medicine contains extremely rich vital elements and important components such as egg yolk lecithin. It is made using the latest scientific methods. Those with stomach problems or indigestion can take it to be quickly absorbed, distributing nutrients throughout the body and generating new "vitality". It is effective for anemia, vomiting, cold chills, stomach cramps, abdominal distension, constipation, excessive gas, and aversion to food. Taking it improves digestive function and replenishes nutrition, like withered trees revitalized in spring. It improves appetite, eliminates various diseases, and significantly increases body weight. Therefore, world-renowned physicians are competing to use it, praising it as the "King of Stomach Medicines".</p>
<h3 id="e206">Immunity: An Effective Treatment for Gonorrhea <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Immunology possesses unparalleled power in modern medicine. Experiments show that injecting bacteria into animals causes the animal's blood serum to have the effect of dissolving the bacteria. Applying this principle to the treatment of gonorrhea has achieved unprecedented success. The German medicine "Klinon" is made using this immune method. Initially, gonococci are transplanted into animals, which causes a direct dissolving action in the blood serum, producing a substance called Alexin, which becomes Complement, and the gonococci are eliminated. Then, it is combined with anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving agents to create "Klinon". After taking it, it immediately exerts a great anti-gonorrheal and bactericidal effect, allowing the human body's blood serum to fully dissolve toxins, leading to their complete elimination. Therefore, this medicine has a special effect on treating gonorrhea with almost certain success, which is truly rare. Furthermore, the medicinal properties are pure and benign, without any harsh side effects. Even taking it when not sick will not harm the stomach. However, when purchasing, it is important to recognize the three characters "Klinon" to avoid mistakenly taking other medicines and avoiding various risks. In recent times, famous public and private hospitals in Europe and the United States have unanimously adopted it, praising it highly. In cases of acute gonorrhea, taking four or five bottles ensures a complete cure. Chronic prostatitis and epididymitis can be cured with six or seven bottles, and severe arthritis can be cured with a maximum of ten bottles. Its miraculous effects are remarkable and renowned worldwide. This is truly a blessing for humanity. - Translated from the German Medical Journal.</p>

<p>The Most Difficult Sexual Aging Problem for Both Sexes</p>
<p>Currently, the most difficult and painful problem for young people is sexual aging. The reasons for this are nothing more than being seduced by bad friends during adolescence, leading to the bad habit of masturbation, or excessive sexual activity, which hinders the development of their youth glands. As a result, men have short stature, underdeveloped lower bodies, nocturnal emissions, premature ejaculation, and weak penile erection, while women have delayed menstruation, leucorrhea, and deformed lower body development. They also have a haggard appearance, premature aging, back pain, weak legs, weak limbs, headaches, insomnia, forgetfulness, palpitations, and long-term infertility, which are all characteristics of sexual aging in both sexes. I have always used "Boti Kang" for men and "Bu Nu Rong" for women to treat sexual aging, with extremely rapid results. This is because these two medicines are the crystallization of Dr. Melen's lifelong efforts. The original formula extracts hormones from the youth of both sexes, such as sea dogs, orangutans, lions, and tigers, and refines them separately.</p>
<p>Mr. He Jiashu, 26 years old, has been married for six years and has not conceived. He indulged in masturbation in his youth, resulting in a weak body, nocturnal emissions, and incomplete penile erection. He also suffered from dizziness, mental confusion, palpitations, shortness of breath, memory loss, and a sallow complexion. Repeatedly taking tonics for strengthening the essence and brain was ineffective. Later, introduced by a friend, he came to me for treatment. This was a sign of sexual neurasthenia. I prescribed him to take twenty "Boti Kang" to transform his sexual system organization for a period of half a month. When he came to see me again, the problems of nocturnal emissions and premature ejaculation had been eliminated, and his vitality had also been revived. He continued to take "Boti Kang" for three weeks, and all his ailments were cured. His muscles became strong and healthy, surpassing his former self. His wife also suffered from menstrual difficulties for a long time, and was taught to take "Bu Nu Rong" for five bottles in a row, and her menstrual period arrived on schedule. After six months, she became pregnant, bringing great joy to the family.</p>

<p>(I) Suddenly Developed Gonorrhea in the Month</p>
<p>Patient Chen Letang, 22 years old, met a girlfriend in a certain amusement park, and soon concluded a Qin-Jin alliance. Unexpectedly, he developed gonorrhea during his honeymoon. The glans penis was huge, the foreskin was inverted, and a lot of purulent blood was secreted. The urethra was burning hot and painful like a needle prick. The urge to urinate was frequent, and excretion was difficult and unsatisfactory. He immediately took German "Klinon" to reduce inflammation and kill bacteria, to relieve swelling and pain. After taking it for less than two weeks, urination felt extraordinarily comfortable, the pain stopped and the swelling subsided. When he came to my clinic again, the condition had decreased by 70 to 80 percent. I again told him to continue taking it for a week and he recovered. Later, it was discovered that his wife originally suffered from gonorrhea, with a lot of leucorrhea in her lower body. I also taught her to use "Carl Scheidig Vaginal Tablets 20" externally, inserting one tablet into the vagina as a suppository to remove the discharge, and to take "Klinon" internally. After taking several bottles of each, the pain stopped and the discharge was clear, and the lesions healed as usual. They still live a sweet life.</p>
<p>(II) Weak Gonorrhea Rescued</p>
<p>Patient Xie Dongshan, 34 years old, suffered from nocturnal emissions. He suffered from gonorrhea the year before, resulting in a listless condition with no improvement. A lot of white liquid was flowing out, and the urethra was swollen and painful, and urination was unpleasant. Repeatedly resolved to treat it, but no good results were seen. When I diagnosed him, it was chronic prostatitis. First, he was told to take "Klinon" to remove gonococci, promote urination and relieve pain. After taking it for three weeks, the pain stopped, the swelling subsided, and the white discharge also stopped. When he returned for a follow-up visit, he was instructed to take "Klinon" and "Boti Kang" at the same time. After two weeks, the gonococci disappeared, his weight increased, and his spirits were high. He was immediately hired by a department store, where he worked diligently and was highly valued by the authorities and promoted to a key position. It has not been issued to date.</p>
<h3 id="e209">The treatment of red and white leucorrhea <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Yueren</p>
<p>Leukorrhea has red and white, and the cause is inflammation of the uterus and genital organs. The secretions are leucorrhea, which is actually a kind of pus, smelly and dirty pants, and the bad smell is unbearable. It is even worse in hot weather. Over time, the lower body will be eroded and the pain will be unbearable. This secretion is acidic, and sperm die when they encounter it, so it is the main cause of infertility. My clinical experiment is that I only use the German "Carl Scheidig Vaginal Tablets" as an external medicine, which is inserted into the vagina before the patient goes to bed, one or two tablets every night. The method is simple and the effect is huge. It can be called a self-healing medicine for leucorrhea. If the patient is weak and has irregular menstruation and other symptoms, he can also take "Bu Nu Rong" internally to regulate menstruation, replenish the brain, and strengthen his physical strength. If a husband's gonorrhea is transmitted and he suffers from leucorrhea, he must take "Klinon" internally to resist gonorrhea and kill bacteria, clear blood toxins, and treat internally and externally in this way. The effect is rapid and abnormal. Therefore, "Carl Scheidig Vaginal Tablets" has long been popular in Europe and the United States. According to statistics from the previous month, more than 93% of those who were cured by external treatment with this medicine were cured.</p>

<p>— Han Pengzhen's contribution</p>
<p>I was careless with my mouth and stomach, and mistakenly ate spoiled food, which caused vomiting and diarrhea. After recovering, I felt full and stuffy in my chest, afraid of eating, noisy and nauseous, sour swallowing and belching, and bloated when eating. Although I took medicine, it was useless. I moved many times, and my stomach and body were weak. My abdominal pain was faint, and I became thin and weak. I was tired and sleepless at night, my heart was pounding, my liver was strong and irritable, and my face was withered. Later, I saw that my colleague Xu Caifu suffered from stomach pain and was cured by taking the German "Strong Stomach Essence". I tried to buy and take four bottles, and I immediately gained food and sleep. My spirit was radiant. I took a large amount of it with peace of mind. In a month, the above-mentioned stomach symptoms were completely cured. This year, my complexion is rosy, my body is strong, and my appetite is strong.</p>

<p>Sexual Repentance</p>
<p>I am 21 years old this year, and I am a loser in sex. Every time I see beautiful young ladies, I will admire and covet them all day and night. I know that my psychology is not good, and over time, I have developed the fatal disease of nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea. Now not only has it not healed, but it has become more serious, and I have also developed fever and cough. What medicine can be used to treat it? - A dying patient, Wei Zixue. (Answer) Nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea are not fatal diseases. As long as you get rid of the desire for women and pay attention to health, and take "Boti Kang" at the same time, then there will be no cure. As for coughing and fever, you can take "Bu Fei Na Er", because this disease is most likely to become lung disease, so you should take this medicine to cure it.</p>
<p>Early Stage of Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Last month, I was seduced by a prostitute and developed gonorrhea. Now I feel that the head of the penis is red and swollen, and urination is astringent and painful. Urination is very painful, and there is a lot of thick and turbid pus. It has only been a week since the disease started. May I ask what is the appropriate treatment? - Wang Benren (Answer) This is acute gonorrhea. Please quickly go to Dr. Yao Juyan, a medical doctor, for electrotherapy and other physical and surgical treatments to avoid becoming chronic gonorrhea. Before being diagnosed, taking "Klinon" and paying attention to hygiene can also cure it.</p>
<p>Three Years of Lung Disease</p>
<p>I have been suffering from the disease for three years. I cough up blood, have a lot of phlegm, shortness of breath, and a great reduction in appetite. I am weak and powerless. Please indicate the proper treatment!) - Ping Zang</p>
<p>(Answer) Your disease is the third stage of lung disease. You can take "Bu Fei Na Yu". If your appetite is poor, you can also take "Strong Stomach Essence" at the same time to increase your appetite, so that your resistance will be greater and your lung disease will be cured. Or please ask Dr. Deng Yuanhe, a lung disease expert, to treat it, and you will be able to cure it quickly. Because Dr. Deng is a lung disease expert in Shanghai for more than 30 years.</p>
<p>Menstrual Irregularities and Excessive Leukorrhea</p>
<p>My wife's menstrual period is irregular, sometimes early and sometimes late, with no regularity. When it comes, she has abdominal pain like a knife cut. After the menstruation is gone, she is tired and sleeps. She also has a lot of leukorrhea and is dizzy and like a dementia. Therefore, she has not been pregnant for many years. Please indicate a good medicine! - Wang Duzhi (Answer) This is ovarian dysfunction. You can take "Bu Nu Rong" to adjust her menstruation and relieve her abdominal pain. For leucorrhea, you can use "Carl Scheidig Vaginal Tablets" externally. Take one tablet and insert it into the vagina before going to bed. Self-treatment at home. Taking it like this for several weeks will definitely be effective.</p>

<p>Patient: Miss Cheng Lingjing, 43 years old, business world (cause) Mistakenly committed masturbation, did not repent for a long time, (symptoms) Dry cough occurred from time to time, relied on being strong, did not pay attention, the cough gradually increased, coughed up blood frequently, appetite decreased, and there was pain in the chest and flanks. Her body was hot at dusk and she lost sleep at night. One sweat every five days, one nocturnal emission every three days. Her essence was dry and her body was deficient, making it unsustainable. Repeated medication failed to heal. Later, introduced by a friend, Mr. Xie, she came to me for treatment (diagnosis) X-ray examination immediately revealed a cavity in the left lung and tubercles densely distributed in the right lobe. It could not be cured by ordinary treatment, so an injection was given and the recuperation method was told. On the one hand, she was instructed to take the German medicine "Bu Fei Na Er", because it is a hormone preparation made from the liver, lungs, pancreas and other organs of whole fish, bear, deer, etc., to nourish blood and remove phlegm, and to cure cough. At the same time, she was instructed to take the German "Bu Ti Kang" to calm and nourish the nerves in order to treat kidney deficiency and insomnia. After taking five bottles, all the cough and blood were lost, and the various symptoms of weakness were swept away. She was instructed to continue taking it for two weeks to ensure a complete cure. Following the instructions, she not only recovered, but also her complexion was radiant and her spirits increased sharply. This spring, the lung examination showed that the cavity had shrunk and the sputum was free of TB germs.</p>

<p>A New Therapy for Correctly Curing Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Gonorrhea cannot be completely cured because patients are careless and the treatment is inappropriate, causing gonococci to penetrate deeply. Furthermore, because they do not know that the poison has been transmitted to their wives, they relapse after a few days of sexual intercourse. Therefore, to prove the method of correct cure, that is, those who have no gonococcal reaction after various stimuli and blood serum tests, can be guaranteed to be completely cured and will never relapse.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the treatment of those who have not been completely cured for a long time, if they are married, both men and women must be treated at the same time. This can achieve the purpose of complete cure. Zheng Shaoqing from ×× Lane, Xizang Road, 30 years old, has been married for ten years and has suffered from gonorrhea for five years. Although he has been cured several times, he relapses a few days after returning home, because his wife has also been infected with gonorrhea for a long time, resulting in a lot of leucorrhea. After a thorough examination by me, I knew that Mr. Zheng had developed complications such as prostatitis and orchitis. I quickly administered anti-gonococcal blood serum and X-ray and electrotherapy, and at the same time took "Klinon" internally, so that bactericidal, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and diuretic effects directly occurred on the lesions. After a month of treatment and four re-examinations, he was completely cured. His wife's leucorrhea erosion had extended to the deep part of the vagina, hindering urination and sexual intercourse. She was immediately instructed to take "Klinon" internally to kill the gonococci scattered inside. Re-use "Carl Scheidig Vaginal Tablets" externally, take one tablet and insert it into the vagina before going to bed to remove the discharge and reduce inflammation. After four weeks of taking the medicine, the leucorrhea has been cleared and the lesions have healed. Both husband and wife had no gonococcal reaction in the blood serum test. They have been living together for several years and have not relapsed. This is solid evidence of the correct cure of old gonorrhea.</p>

<h3 id="e214">What is the Point of Being a League of Nations Councilor? <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Useless</p>
<p>The League of Nations was originally a paper tiger, a tool for several powerful nations to manipulate and control weaker nations. Therefore, after the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident), this paper tiger was already exposed. With the Abyssinian Crisis (Second Italo-Ethiopian War), this paper tiger can be considered to have ceased to exist. Therefore, the seat of a councilor in the League of Nations now, let alone campaigning or requesting for it, even if they sent an invitation with twenty-four pages, one could only respond with the four characters "Respectfully decline".</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the League of Nations, our country's representatives have strived for a councilor seat in the League of Nations Administrative Council, but it was never resolved. Ultimately, due to China's weak military strength and many domestic troubles, they were disappointed. This year in September, the League of Nations Administrative Council will be reorganized again. The Administrative Council Organization Committee has recently discussed the allocation of councilor seats. According to the committee's resolution, this year's League of Nations General Assembly should add one non-permanent councilor seat to the Administrative Council to appease China. Although the committee's decision still awaits the approval of the Administrative Council and a two-thirds vote by the General Assembly, judging from today's trends, China's acquisition of a seat on the Administrative Council this year does not seem to face much difficulty. Although this matter is appreciated as a gesture of goodwill from the League of Nations Administrative Council Organization Committee, and we are grateful for their attention, at this stage, there is no need to go to the League of Nations to serve as a non-permanent councilor. Let me ask, what is it like to be a non-permanent councilor of the League of Nations Administrative Council? What is it like not to be a non-permanent councilor of the League of Nations Administrative Council?</p>
<p>I will now briefly review the League of Nations' political achievements over the past few years and the current situation of the League of Nations member states, and consider them. The current organizational system of the League of Nations Administrative Council was actually established with the formation of the Locarno Treaties in 1926, when Germany joined the League of Nations. At that time, it was decided that Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and Germany would be permanent councilors, with nine additional non-permanent councilors. Therefore, the League of Nations' organization was entirely centered on Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and Germany. Now, Germany and Japan have withdrawn from the League of Nations. Although Italy has not withdrawn, since the League of Nations resolved that Italy was an aggressor nation, the League of Nations has adopted an opposing stance towards Italy. Therefore, although Italy's name has not been withdrawn, it has de facto seceded. Therefore, the current League of Nations has only Britain and France as its center, as well as Soviet Russia, which joined later. However, Britain and France have different dreams in the same bed, and their opinions also differ. Therefore, there is also talk of Britain withdrawing from the League of Nations. To join such a disorganized League of Nations is truly foolish.</p>
<p>Moreover, the reason why countries want to join the League of Nations is because it can help weak countries and use the power of the League of Nations to sanction the aggression of strong countries, and use the League of Nations as a relief agency for weak nations. However, during the September 18th Incident, although our country sought divination and prayed sincerely, there was no effect. During the Abyssinian Crisis, Abyssinia also shouted itself hoarse and prostrated in prayer. Although the League of Nations performed great feats, Abyssinia was eventually annihilated, and the effect was also equal to zero. And the membership fees that the League of Nations member states pay to the League of Nations are not insignificant. Only a big fool would be willing to waste this kind of wronged money. Therefore, judging from the above situation, even being a member state of the League of Nations is somewhat disdainful, and wanting to be a non-permanent councilor is even more futile.</p>

<p>The next room was the pharmacy, with rows and rows of white-painted shelves filled with medicine bottles of various sizes. A pharmacist wearing a brand-new Western suit was mixing ointments at the desk. The bright, oiled hair reflected a thin, white face with a charming smile on the corner of his lips. While working, he was stealing glances at the nurse who was cutting gauze next to him.</p>
<p>"Miss Li, where did the director go? It's past ten o'clock, I wonder if we're taking appointments?"</p>
<p>"He went to little Zhang's room again." Miss Li glanced at him.</p>
<p>"Are we taking appointments today or not? He didn't tell me."</p>
<p>"How would I know? It's like you're very happy to do it," she glanced at him again.</p>
<p>"Who's happy! It's just boring to stay here all the time. I think I'll ask Old Li." He said, walking to the window.</p>
<p>"Old Li, Old Li, ask the director if we're taking appointments today. Hurry up!" he shouted.</p>
<p>"Today is Saturday, tomorrow is Sunday. If we don't take appointments today, that's at least two days—" Miss Li calculated softly. She suddenly stopped talking and started giggling.</p>
<p>"How fun, two days?" she said, laughing.</p>
<p>"Let's go to Jinan in the afternoon, okay?" the pharmacist said, walking closer to her.</p>
<p>"When will we be back?"</p>
<p>"The morning train the day after tomorrow. — Two full days." His hand rested on her shoulder.</p>
<p>"Okay, this place is killing me, I can't stand living here for even a day! Everything is so provincial. You tell me, if those things really come to see a doctor, are you really going to wash them and apply medicine for them? I think I'll throw up."</p>
<p>"It's really a provincial place!" the pharmacist said sympathetically. "Look, I just changed my clothes, and they get dirty after walking down the street. If my shoes step on the mud road, I have to brush them again when I get back. Let's go back to Qingdao in a few days." Han leaned against the desk, holding the woman's hand.</p>
<p>"The director said that since it's the grand opening today, we won't be taking appointments." Old Li shouted from outside the window.</p>
<p>"Got it, go away." The two looked at each other and smiled.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, a piece of paper was added next to the front door: "This hospital will be closed for one day due to the grand opening ceremony today. Appointments will be taken from Monday." (The End)</p>

<p>— Li Xuan</p>
<p>Old Scar sat at the entrance of the temple, his back, covered in a layer of mud, bare. The temple front was still and quiet. Sunlight shone on the facing wall all the way to the offering table of the Five Path Lord statue. Old Scar leaned against the base of the wall, using a greasy black hand to scratch the ribs under his armpit. His fingernails rasped, and small flakes of mud fell down like bran. He yawned, lowered his head, and began to catch lice on the faded, patchwork military jacket again. The lice were wriggling along the torn seams, white ones, with a small, dark red sac inside their small, plump bodies. He watched the little things scurrying about, trying to hide, and smiled, revealing his blackened lips:</p>
<p>"Where do you think you're going!"</p>
<p>He gently pinched one between two fingers, rubbing it. After a while, the louse fainted. He threw it onto the brick under his feet and pressed down with his thumbnail. *Pop*, a slight sound rang out. Old Scar licked his lips and joked to himself:</p>
<p>"Come back and bite me next life, ha."</p>
<p>There were so many lice. As soon as he crushed one, he turned around to find two more piled together. Old Scar smiled slightly. He opened his palm and spat a mouthful of sticky phlegm into it. He rubbed his hands together and then, like a crab, spread out his arms. He spread his thumb and forefinger on each hand and pinched a louse, separating them.</p>

<p>— Written by Chen Haoxiong</p>
<p>"Why are you two being so intimate in broad daylight!"</p>
<p>Saying this, with two pops, the fleas were crushed on the brick and died. He put on his cotton jacket, looked up at the sunlight under the eaves of the temple, stood up, and muttered to himself:</p>
<p>"Lice that can't be gotten rid of, thieves that can't be caught—Ah, I should go find something to eat."</p>
<p>As soon as he turned past the facing wall in front of the temple, someone came running diagonally from the east. Wearing a black jacket and a pair of</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>torn blue woolen pants, her hair was disheveled and draped around her neck. She ran unsteadily like an old woman, holding a little girl in her arms. She opened her mouth wide, crying and shouting, "I want my mom," and hit the thin face with her small hand. The man only twisted his head when he was hit, and his legs moved faster, panting and wheezing. He staggered to the entrance of the temple, saw someone, brushed his hair, and ran west again. But Old Scar recognized who it was, raised his voice, and shouted:</p>
<p>"Ma Qing, whose child are you carrying?"</p>
<p>The fellow was so startled that he drilled straight into the town like a madman. This made Old Scar look strange. He was just about to go into the town to find something to eat. He pondered: This morphine ghost won't be up to anything good. He ran in one breath, chasing after him, still shouting as he ran:</p>
<p>"What's going on? Why are you acting like a rabbit that's seen a hawk!"</p>
<p>As he chased, the morphine ghost never dared to turn his head. He ran into the town entrance in one breath, turned down a small street, pinched the child in his arms to shut her up, and turned into a small yellow door with a wooden sign that read "Matsui Foreign Pharmacy" like a whirlwind. Old Scar chased to the door and froze, gasping for breath. Inside, he knew it was a Korean-run pharmacy. He sat on the stone platform next to the door, feeling even hungrier, and hugged his arms, unable to figure out what Ma Qing that kid was up to...</p>
<p>At this moment, someone came out of the small side door, the rustling of footsteps causing Old Scar to turn his face and look inside. It happened to be Yang Monkey. They had spent the whole winter together in the Five Path Temple last winter. Now he was doing well, "doing odd jobs" for the foreign firm. Old Scar looked up and said:</p>
<p>"Monkey."</p>
<p>"What are you doing here? You're not buying medicine (morphine)."</p>
<p>That hunchback mumbled, looking at the morphine gourd opposite him, who was so hunched over that he couldn't straighten his back, he felt that he had changed so quickly, and said, blinking:</p>
<p>"Damn, I haven't eaten anything yet. Your foreign firm..."</p>
<p>"What a coincidence," he clapped his hands and said, "can you run this errand for me? I'll give you twenty cents."</p>
<p>"What's the catch? You're talking nonsense, you have twenty cents?"</p>
<p>This stooped man didn't say a word, took a piece of white paper out of his bag and handed it to Old Scar, and then took out twenty cents, and then ordered like an owner:</p>
<p>"You deliver this letter to the Hu family on North Street and tell them to bring fifty dollars to Matsui Foreign Pharmacy to redeem their daughter before twelve o'clock today. Double it tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Oh, so that's what Ma Qing that kid is doing!"</p>
<p>"This is a good business, you can get ten or twenty dollars for getting one person. Don't you want to try..."</p>
<p>"Isn't it illegal?"</p>
<p>"We're a foreign firm, what are we afraid of."</p>
<p>Old Scar bought a few sesame cakes and ate them while walking towards North Street. He passed the house where the foreign soldiers lived. There was a flag with red dots hanging at the door. He thought that this spring marked four years since the Chinese soldiers were defeated that year, and he hadn't seen them since. But there were more and more soldiers walking like ducks.</p>

<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>"In April, the holly blooms with camellias,</p>
<p>Young girls climb all over the mountains,</p>
<p>Could there be a young lad coming from somewhere,</p>
<p>With a handsome face,</p>
<p>Singing mountain songs drifting in the wind,</p>
<p>Singing makes the young girls' chests jump!</p>
<p>Picking camellias, not wanting too few,</p>
<p>The young girls' wages are given to the mountain song lad..."</p>
<p>Gui Zhen's tattered blue cloth clothes carried a light cloth bag. Her youthful, rosy cheeks faced the sun. The April sun, like her face, climbed up the hillside with a bit of shyness. The distant, spreading hillside! Covered with verdant camellias, reflecting a silent picture in their eyes. This group of young girls climbed up the hillside one after another. Most of them sang gentle and charming mountain songs. Gui Zhen jumped innocently, shaking her head, and her black braid fluttered in the spring breeze. Just then, a stone was thrown from under the thick leaves of the small tree, followed by chuckles. Gui Zhen's heart jumped. She opened her eyes and looked over:</p>
<p>"It's that foul-mouthed Xiao Zhen!" She cursed, jumping and running over. "When did you come?"</p>
<p>The young girl, Xiao Zhen, did not answer her, but just couldn't help laughing for a while before saying from the thick leaves:</p>
<p>"Don't run over! Guess what else is here? Your mountain song lad is waiting for you!"</p>
<p>Gui Zhen's face turned red, like the sun hanging in the eastern sky.</p>
<p>"Sing! Sister Gui Zhen! Your singing is even better than the lad's."</p>
<p>"Hmph! You really know how to tease people. You're actually mixed up with the young lad! Still trying to spread rumors!"</p>
<p>Gui Zhen said, laughing, and grabbed their arms, her happy heart leaping, and ran to the hillside. It was the Qingming Festival. It had rained for a few days, and the dry wilderness was now covered with moist dew. Camellias "sprouted green" all over the fields. The yellowish-purple and light green tea buds were all blooming, gently swaying in the gentle wind. From near and far, there were girls picking tea everywhere. Their bodies were so light, lively, and hopping like swallows. They stretched out their arms and started busy with the work of picking tea. Gui Zhen, Xiao Qi, and A Si, were also girls picking flowers in this tea mountain. So, as soon as they climbed the hillside, they could meet many acquaintances. Everyone sang, argued, and shouted together, but their hands were constantly picking, rarely taking the time to look at the distant hillside and the sun, which was gradually slipping away with its red and beautiful colors. But they were mostly young girls who loved to talk and laugh. Like Gui Zhen and Xiao Zhen, they kept talking and laughing. Sometimes, Gui Zhen secretly broke some dry branches and threw them into Xiao Zhen's bamboo basket, then, pressing the mouth of her own cloth bag with her left hand, laughed.</p>
<p>"Don't be so annoying! I'll tell your lover tonight that you've hooked up with someone else on the mountain!"</p>
<p>"Go ahead and say it! I don't have one, only you have a dozen or so, A Si! Are you right?"</p>
<p>A Si quickly picked the tender tea buds. Hearing them fooling around, she couldn't help but raise her head:</p>
<p>"Who knows, you all have ten or eight!"</p>
<p>Saying this, the three couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>"Okay! Xiao Zhen, pity her, that foul-mouthed girl has no man, give her three or two!"</p>
<p>"Always fooling around, look, other people have picked full baskets, only we have picked so little, how can we go back to face people!"</p>
<p>A Si said, twisting her mouth. She thought of home, of her old mother at home! Her weak old mother, she couldn't go up the mountain to pick tea anymore. So, besides her brother working as a farmhand in someone else's house, the family's expenses still depended on her tea picking income to help. But, although she had strength and could pick, she could only pick fifteen or sixteen catties at most (very few people could pick twenty catties). Each catty was only four copper coins, and picking all day long was only a hundred copper coins!………………Thinking about it, she became anxious again.</p>
<p>"It's really not easy!" A Si muttered: "Look! This year's spring is too cold, most of the camellias are frozen and withered. Qingming has arrived, and although it has rained for a few days, there are still many that have not sprouted!"</p>
<p>"Really! If you look at it this way! In three or five days of picking, there will be nothing to pick! Then we won't have any work to do!"</p>
<p>Gui Zhen said in a depressed tone, raising her head to look at the green tea trees all over the fields, and the girls picking tea all over the fields. The sun was already hanging high in the sky. She also thought of the low tea prices last year and the sluggish sales:</p>
<p>"Maybe, this year will be the same, with no sales! I heard that the seas, Shanghai, are full of Japanese goods."</p>
<p>They talked and searched, looking at the tea hills that were not full of tender buds. The sun was about to set.</p>
<p>Continued on Page 5 of the Local Supplement</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>It was going down. However, they were hungry, enduring their sore waists, and picking tea leaves nervously.</p>
<p>"Sister Gui Zhen, I heard that picking at the Liu family's is only three copper coins a catty, and that scale is very big too!"</p>
<p>Xiao Qi shook her head. A Si continued:</p>
<p>"The harvest is bad, and there are no sales, it's even harder for us tea pickers!"</p>
<p>In Gui Zhen's mind, she thought of tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, maybe there would be no tea to pick, no wages…… She raised her head and looked at them, sighed, and said:</p>
<p>"The sun is setting, it's going to get dark! Let's go back!"</p>
<p>As they walked arm in arm, following the many girls, in twos and threes, running down the dark hillside, the clear mountain songs, followed by the spring evening wind, gently wafted:</p>
<p>"The sun sets in the west, a bit of yellow,</p>
<p>Young lady carries a stick and chases a weasel.</p>
<p>The weasel's feet are small and can steal chickens;</p>
<p>The young lady's feet are small and can steal a man."</p>

<p>Zigong said, "To be poor without flattery, and rich without arrogance, what do you think?" The Master said, "Acceptable, but not as good as being poor and joyful, and rich and loving propriety." Zigong said, "The Book of Odes says, 'As if cutting, as if filing; as if carving, as if polishing.' Is that what it means?" The Master said, "Ci, now I can discuss the Book of Odes with you. Tell you the past and you know the future."</p>
<p>The Master said, "Do not worry that others do not know you; worry that you do not know others."</p>
<p>The Master said, "Governing with virtue is like the North Star, abiding in its place, and all the stars revolve around it."</p>
<p>The Master said, "The three hundred Odes can be summed up in one sentence: 'Do not think impurely.'"</p>
<p>The Master said, "Lead them with government orders and regulate them with punishments, and the people will avoid [crime] but have no sense of shame. Lead them with virtue and regulate them with ritual, and they will have shame and also be upright."</p>

<p>The weather is clear and the herbs are fragrant. Unable to dispel my worries, I stroll through the streets. I am, born with a chivalrous heart that is hard to subdue. Unexpectedly, I married Yan Xijiao. I have to swallow my anger and suffer in silence. Unexpected incidents are no one's concern. Affairs of the pillow are especially strange. She is, like a drifting catkin, hard to restrain. Constantly, stirring up trouble, looking for snakes in the grass. Oh, how hateful! Oh, how hateful! Her dissolute behavior is not punished by heaven. Now, her disloyal heart has already been revealed. Oh, Yan Xijiao, I see that, your constant quarrels are not without reason. When the truth is revealed, how will you resist? Full of thoughts, my mind is confused. I meet her mother on the street. She has failed the fragrant quilt until today. How can I comfort Xijiao? She is, tears often thinking of you. I still regret my troubles. You must know that, quarrels between husband and wife are common. You should not, stubbornly run elsewhere. It is so coincidental to meet here. I advise you to be patient and return to your fragrant nest for now. My thoughts are confused, and my body is too lazy to lift. I am, suddenly startled by a shout. One is, a thorn in my eye, meeting with resentment in my heart. The other is, afraid she will not come even in broad daylight. But they say Sanlang is sitting downstairs, making me suspicious. This time, I will punish his unfaithfulness. I will make him, kneel in the courtyard to apologize. Only then can I quell my anger.</p>
