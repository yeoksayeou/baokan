<p>— 緯</p>
<p>華北今日之局面自其表面觀之雖暫呈靜止狀態然駐屯軍之擴充也滄石鐵路之擬經營也龍烟煤礦之擬採掘也平西湯山之擬設鍊鋼廠也冀察公路網之擬大事建築也北方不凍港之擬開闢也皆足證明外力在華北之發展仍本其一貫政策「軍事行動」與「經濟開發」雙管齊下因程序之不同而步驟有緩急此乃其政策之活用非予中國有喘息之機會也</p>
<p>就經濟上言華北不獨爲吾國礦產富饒之區爲吾國出產棉花最多之區惟最宜種植棉花者僅冀魯晋省之棉田面積及其產量歷年平均的占全國三分之一強東三省之被占領也關東軍之計劃卽圖擴大滿洲棉花種植面積以供其國內紡織業之用然因地土氣候之不適宜三年來之結果證明推廣棉花種植毫無成績可言東三省之棉田根據外人統計一九三三年爲一二二·五〇〇英畝其產量爲一二〇、〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊一九三四年爲二〇〇·〇〇〇英畝而其產額僅一五六、三四〇·〇〇〇一九三五年爲一一八·三〇〇英畝其產額亦僅九〇、〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊此戔戔之數除供東省農民自身消費外可運出而供工業之用者爲量極少日本爲獲得棵花原料目光之移注華北乃其必然之勢日本以天津爲其農業中心對華北農民以技術經濟援且獎勵農民栽培棉花所謂經濟合作所謂開發華北其着眼點乃皆在此</p>
<p>因此所謂經濟開發乃獲得原料之別名以華北資源之富人口之多在經濟意義上不獨可解决其國內原料之不足且可爲其過剩商品傾銷之尾閭日本工業品因其勞力低廉品質較遜售價獨廉使歐美商品無法與之競爭故黃色貿易早有壓倒一切之勢加之自外力深入華北以來走私橫行中國海關雖曾努力緝私然以華北受塘沽協定之制限及僞自治成立後之結果此等地帶中國地方當局早已無法過問而私貨之來源地卽由此等地帶運往天津租界各貨棧然後再由貨棧分散各地商家海關人員明知私貸無法緝捕者有之緝捕而遭私販武力抗拒者有之卽査出沒收而橫遭駐軍干涉者亦有之據海關統計去年一年中私運入口之貨物其價値達二萬一千萬元本年一·二·三·三個月中私運入口之貨物更多其價値至少在一萬萬元以上在此種情形之下因走私橫行之結果日本商品受漏稅之惠與他國商品比較成本自相去懸殊。貨之獨占華北市場因勢所必然同時中國關稅收入發生絕大影響亦自屬意料中事其結果不獨影響中國財政卽外債担保亦將發生問題說者謂某國人之鼓勵走私破壞中國海關行政尙挾有一大且的蓋中國之總稅務司向以英人充任地位重要夙爲某國人所覬觀近來所以不顧國際信義百計鼓勵走私者卽爲要索此席之張本總之人之謀我無孔不入固不僅對海關行政爲然海關行政之攘奪特其小焉者耳</p>

<p>海雲掉頭　國營招商局之海雲輪、即係購入之法船達飛號所改稱、專行連去港裝隴海路貨物者此次來滬、於前日（二十號）上午十時許、海雲開進吳淞、駛往浦東之楊家渡碼頭、停泊卸貨、查楊家渡碼頭與浦東之日清碼頭昆連啣接、海雲輪到楊家渡時、例先掉頭、然後靠泊、其時江面則風激潮烈、海雲船主黃鴻騫就江面將輪轉身、照例船道係向浦東面掉轉者、詎日清公司之廬山丸輪、</p>
<p>不顧江面　有船掉頭、就從日清碼頭起椗開行、係駛往福州及廣東者、廬山丸在離碼頭時、係船尾行由碼頭上橫出、打倒車而至江面、然後開行、廬山丸船尾伸出之時、海雲正欲轉頭、黃船主見此情形大警、恐釀巨禍、急將海雲輪之船道改向西掉、以期避免重碰之禍、無如日輪此際並未停車、或因不及、以致廬山丸之船尾、已經向海雲輪之左舷</p>
<p>中艙碰撞　致海雲左外舷中艙鐵板受授、廬山丸輪之後尾、亦以反激過猛、撥壞頗巨、此時廬山丸之船身尙未全離碼頭、在該輪之前、本停有嵩山丸輪、及南陽丸輪兩艘、廬山丸後尾揥後、其船首轉向南陽丸後尾將所擊之錮絲纜衝斷、以致南陽丸輪亦受到極度之靈盪、先將在船身外擋的駁船　艘猛激、其靠輪之一駁、竟</p>
<p>軋入輪底　損毀至巨、在外擋的一駁、亦遭擊壞、南陽丸輪首尾啣泊者、為嵩山丸輪、已經裝齊貨件、搭載旅客、正欲開赴北洋各埠、不意經南陽輪之一撞、其船頭之鐵錨、對凖嵩山丸輪之後尾衝去、致又將嵩山丸之後尾鐵板、被</p>
<p>南陽撞破</p>
<p>幸而損破處與廬山丸輪之後尾毀壞、同在載貨沙沙綫以上、與航行尙無重大妨碍、惟該兩輪均以急待開駛、未能久留在滬、當時船主即報生日清公司、第雲船主黃鴻騫、亦陳報總局、日清公司得報立請公正人員到兩輪檢騐損害、佔計一切損失、擬向招商局交涉、一面令廬山丸與嵩山丸侯騐過後先行開出、其損壞處暫時略修、候此行返滬、再行大修、招商局亦派張工程師</p>
<p>檢騐海雲</p>
<p>並查詢碰撞之經過、復由張工程師至兩日輪勘騐情形以此次之碰撞責任、完全在日輪廬山丸開船時之不顧浦江有船、致釀此禍端、咎不在海雲輪、昨日午後、已將此事分報、航政局、並通知保險、昨日午後、已將此事分報航政局、並通知保險公司、派員覆騐、關於責任問題、將由雙方交涉、海雲輪損害尙輕、今晨仍可開赴海州連雲港、至於軋毀之駁船等、則歸日清辦理、今回之一撞而損二輪、並擊毀駁船、其損失可謂極巨矣、</p>

<p>（上海工商業概況這二十三）</p>
<p>一·上海保險業之沿吊</p>
<p>上海保險業之鼻祖，當推英商永福與小東方兩公司，兩公司創設於一八叫六年，其時規模甚小，國人亦不了解保險之性質與意義，故受保者多屬外人，一八八五年中國招商局創設仁濟和保險公司，是爲我國經營水火保險之始，迫一八八八年至一九〇〇年間，永福公司製成華人死亡經騐表，開始承保華壽險，乃先後有美國之紐的人壽保險公司New　York　ＬifeIn　Co.公平人壽保險公司The　Equitable　LifeIns.　Co.　of　Ｎew　Yourk在華設立分公司，一八九九年，中國永年人壽保險公司成立，此為國人經營壽險之始，此後外人在滬設立之水火保險分公司者，殆不勝枚舉，一九○五年後，華商保險公司始成勃興之象，計有合衆，華安，華興，華成，萬豐，福安等公司成立，一九〇五年成立上海保險公會，此時華商保險衆已漸具規模，嗣後華安合羣保險公司，永寗保險行，中央信託公司保險部，寗紹商輪公司保險部，相繼辦，先施永安等復設分公司於上海，於是上海保險業，遂愈兒興盛，最近三年，上海金融界因受工商衰落，農村破產，資金集中都巿之影響，復競以其過剩之資金，投資於保險　，以是益呈長足之進步，不特新公司（如太平天一等）紛紛成立，日資本之雄厚，遠超龍者，固亦為今日整個社會不景氣中之一特殊現象也。</p>
<p>二·上海保險　之現况</p>
<p>一、華商洋商數量之對比</p>
<p>目前上海之保險公司，以敬量言，洋商公司的一百四十餘家，華商僅二十六家，華洋合辦者二家，以資本言，華商公司總分行合計在內，實收資本二千五百餘萬元，洋商公司雖因百分之八十，均係代理性質，其資本數字，一時頗難統計，但就美國保險公會一家而言，其資本即達一萬三千六百四十叫萬餘美金，華商資本之微薄，誠與洋商相去霄壤。</p>
<p>二、各國在滬保險公司之概况</p>
<p>上海洋商保險公司之勢力，當推英商為最大，美商决之，法日保險公司則甚少，至德，意，瑞，奧及其他國籍之公司，其勢力則更為微弱，茲分述如下：</p>
<p>A英商：英商保險公司中，尤以），保安保險公司Union　Insurance　Society　of　Canton　Ltd保裕保險公司Employes'　Liability　AssuranceCorp,Ltd．保泰保險公司　South　british　Ｉnsurance　Co　公裕太陽保險公司Sun　Insurance　Ｃffice,　Ltd　等四公司為領袖，茲將前兩公司之內容，略述於下：</p>
<p>一，保安保險公司　　該公司創立於一八三五年，在香港政府註冊，資本總額一百萬金磅，實收資本五十四萬金磅，總公司設於香港，分公司遍於廣州，漢口，北平，天津，上海等處，專保水險，火險，汽車險，信用險，四種，為股份有限公司，其董事爲C.　G.　Mackie,S.H.　Dodwell.J.　Owen　Hugbes,　G,　MIskinoT.A.　Mitcbell,K.S.　Monison總經理為A.　W.Hughes上海分公司設於外灘奪六號，成立於一九〇八年，現經理爲G．G．Franklin</p>
<p>二、保裕保險公司該公司總公司設於倫數，一八八〇年設立上海分公司於外灘沙遜大厦，經理爲　Bang　T．R．君，現任上海洋商火險公會主席，該公司資產總額的一千七百萬磅，每年保費收入的七百餘萬磅。</p>
<p>B美商：美商保險公司，當推美國保險公會，American　Foreign　In,　urance　Associatn北美洲保險公司，In,urance　Company　of　Nortb　America保險公司，AmericaAsiatic　Unjerwrite,　Fed,　Inc,　U.S.A家範圍最大，茲分述其內容如下：</p>
<p>一、美國保險公會總公司設立於美國紐的彌敦哥　Maiden　Lane　八十號，上海分公司在廣東路五一號，係以下十七家美國公司所聯合組織：American　Insurance　Co.　New　Yook　N.J,　Continental　Insurace　Co,　New　York,　Fidelity-Phenix　Fire　Ins.　Co.　New　YorkFire　AssociationPhiladelphia,　Pa,　Glens,　Fa;cs　Ins　Bo.　New　York.　Great　American　Ins.Co,　New　York,　Halifax　Fire　Ins.　Co,　conneticut　Home　Indemnity　Co,　New　York,　Natonal　Fire　Ins　Co.　Hartford　Conn,　NEw　HaCi.　hire　Fire　Ins.　Co,　Springield　Frei　&amp;nMisrae　In　.　Co.　Minnesota,　United　States　Fie　Ins.Co,New　York,　Westchester　Fire　In　s.　Co,　New　York,&amp;　Home　Ins,Co,　NewYork,　U.S.A</p>
<p>上述十七家公司，實收資本，共美金一三六、四四二、七三七·〇〇元，公積達美金三八一、一一九〇七四·〇〇元，共資產總額在在一九三二年時，値美金七〇七、九三九、三二四·〇〇元，是年收入保險費達美金二四七、三九一、九四五·〇〇元。該公會各種性質保險均承保，在華每年保險費收入的華幣一百萬元，駐華總經理為M，上海協理為　Muldoon　A.G君，漢口天津亦設有分會。</p>
<p>二、北美洲保險公司該公司成立於一七九二年，總公司在美國費城Philaidelana在華分公司有香港，上海，天津等處，上海分公司設於九江路一二號，實收資本共美金一千二百萬，資產現値七千二百餘萬，承保各種性質保險，其總經理為Kreulen　Ｒ．Ａ．上海分公司經理為Petrsen　V.I.G華經理朱言斌君。</p>
<p>三、美亞保險公司該公司為代理性質之公司，成立於民國九年，遼東總行設於本埠外灘一七號，分行設於漢口，天津，重慶，廣州，杭州，福州，香港，仰光，小呂宋，巴達維亞，海防紐的等處，實收資本二、七九七、二〇二·八〇元，公積及準備金一、〇七四、七六四·八九元，（一九三三年止）董事長兼總經理為Slan　C.V，現為友邦銀行董事長，四海泰山等保險公司董事，承保各種保險，代理保險行多至二十六家，每年保費收入達三百萬元，惟前年則减退至八十一萬餘兀，其歷年盈餘如下民國十九年　二五二、三三·〇四兩民國二〇年　三〇二、〇四三·六二兩民國一二年　七八、六五七·八五兩民國二二年　三四四、八〇八·七七元民國二三年一四四、一九九·六五元</p>
<p>該公司投資方面，執有友邦人壽保險公司股票，在其總額四萬股中，獨佔二萬五千股，投資於法美保險公司，的佔其資產牛數，此外並為四海保險公司股東。在上海保險代理公司中，堪稱巨臂，惟自美豐銀行淸理後，該公司在該銀行投資十八萬三千元，均遭損失，財力不免略受影響（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c154">首都的國貨商場 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— 瘦秋</p>
<p>在這兩三年裹，首都對於提倡國貨的聲浪，的確是很高的，有一部的人，也都知道提倡國貨的重要性。在這種狀况之下，於是國貨商場，也就應運而興了—在現在首都的國貨商塲，共計有叫處，資格最老的，首推淮淸橋國貨陳列館裏的國貨商場；規模最大的，那耍以最近開幕的中央商場了？關於這四處國貨商場的情形，現在分別的幻述在後面：</p>
<p>中央商塲　中央商塲開幕才兩三個月，它的地點是在中正路，靠着新街口廣塲不遠，距離太平路，中山路等也很近，所以地點是很好的。那裹面的商店，也很齊全，並且還有一所中國銀行，和一家中央花園，這是其他各商塲所沒有的。樓上有一家中菜館：：更有一家西餐社：理髮所也有一所，全塲的商店，的有一百多家，有上海國貨工廠聯合營業所，都是上海有名的工廠，為全塲殺有精彩最有價値的商塲。三樓是辦事處，塲裏的墻柱上，都懸掛着提倡國貨和新生活的標語。售貨員也都有一個證章，以便易於辨認。所以秩序方面，的確非常整齊。商塲的右首，是一家大華電影院，不過現在還沒有開幕，如果開慕以後，該塲的營業當然要比現在好多了</p>
<p>該塲有一個特點，就是找進找出，並不依照南京的銀錢行市，而以財政部規定的法價為標準。因為南京的行市，每一元法幣，可兌銅元三千一百幾十文，而在該塲，則以每元三千文計算，不論找進找出，都楚這樣的。</p>
<p>國貨商塲　淮淸橋的國貨商塲，是實業部國貨陳列館所附設的。在南京已有十年上下的歷史了！不過因為地點不很適宜的緣故，在競爭方面，似乎要吃點虧。可是現在該處已經造成馬路了，交通也還算便利，加之該塲對於一切營業，頗能實事求是，這是很値得讚許的。該塲的大門，在國貨陳列館的左邊。大概是兩個月前吧？該場已經移歸南京市政府管理，和實業部是脫離關係了。</p>
<p>中國國貨公司　它的地址是在建康路奇望街中央銀行的間壁，也是一個熱鬧的所在，它開幕到現在，已經有一年又六個月了，營業方面，據說是很發達。因為它是南京市政府所辦的，差不多的地方，自然佔些便宜，可是該公司的地點很狹小，這似乎是美中不足。不過在那條馬路上，要找一個佔地較多的房屋，的確是很不容易的。好在該公司的營業，並不會因地點狹小而减色呀！</p>
<p>因為該公司是巿府所辦的，所以對於貨色方面，很是不錯，售價也還公道，這是値得稱讚的。</p>
<p>大中國商塲　它好像開幕還沒有一年，它的地址，是太平路門窄橋世界大飯店的舊址，除了大門以外，北部也開了一個門，起其太平路來，也是南京的一條熱鬧馬路，但是不知什麽緣故，該塲的營業，却並不見得好。最近，該塲曾舉行大减價一個月，購滿一元的，並贈送獎學金的獎券，同時，更有犧牲品。無敵牙粉，一分錢可以買三袋；固本肥皂，一塊售洋一分，雙錢牌膠皮鞋也祗賣五角五分，這可說是誠實大犧牲了！但是除了犧牲品買的人還多，其餘的營業，依然是很淸淡的。</p>
<p>南京的國貨商塲，除了上面所說的四家以外，在現在還沒有第五家出現。最後，再要報吿一下的，就是中央商塲，為當防止抬高售價起見，將組織一個評價委員會，大概該塲也聽到外面的傳說了！因為很有不少的人說該塲的貨物售價，是比較昂貴一點的。</p>

<p>— 馨秀</p>
<p>李夫人是很愛好化裝的，她允其是對於頭髮非常注意，因為她保護得好，所以她的頭髮時常是滋潤芳香，髮髻如雲。</p>
<p>但是李夫人所用的香粉，香蜜，美容霜，雖然都是國貨，可是香髮水一項，却用的是舶來品，有人詢問她，她總是說：「國貨的高等香髮水，向來很少，所以使我引為憾事，不得</p>
<p>最近，李夫人的梳妝台上是放着淸一色的國貨化妝品了，原來她聽說五洲藥房有一種新出品的香髮水很好，便買回來一試，果然滿意，於是她又對人說：『現有了「一三一香髮水」，我這困難的問題就解决了。』</p>

<h3 id="c156">兩廣考察與南洋考察 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>上海實業界組織兩廣實業考察團，歸來末久，最近又復發起南洋商業考察團，預定七月初出國。有人問兩廣實業考察團之結果何若？記者認為此行收穫，雖無驚人之成績，但彼此情　，已見溝通，彼此隔閡，巳能消除，而最大之效力，則滬粵桂之貿易，將由間接的，進而為直接的，將由枝節的，進而為整個的。希望最短期內，由粵之省營物產經理處廣州市商會，與桂之出入口貿易經理處，與工商局等，會同上海之市商會中國工業總聯合會與國貨團體，組織一相互貿易局之經理機關，以負担此種永久之使命。粵挂當局及伍廷颺先生，俱主張應有此種組織，而各實業家亦力贊其成，不久之將來，或可起草組織，商定辦法，俾粵桂滬之貿易，可以開發展之新紀元，而不負此决之考察，此則記者所殷願切禱者也。至南洋商業考察團之組織，允為今日國外貿易上所切要；記者之意，應網羅各業領袖，親往一行，事前允應有充分之凖備，與切實之接洽，時間不妨從容，調査最宜研究。而彼此聯絡之方案，相互貿易之計劃，最好在事前先有準備，帶往研究，庶幾考察之時，卽可商定，或可卽席組織，俾返滬後，卽得進行，似更較有效，此則於未去以前，敢獻其一得者也。</p>
<h3 id="c157">國貨的兩條進行綫 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>國貨工業在現階段，展開在我們面前的，是兩條十分淸晰地正確地進行綫，一條是積極的謀海外市塲的開拓，允其是對於南洋各地的擴展貿易，使消滅入超和增加輸出。一條是努力務使國產深入民間，向邊區各省設法推銷，佈成全國產銷合作之網</p>
<p>近年來的我們國貨的前途，因了國貨界的埋頭苦幹，政府的保護，和全體民衆熱烈的擁戴，確已使工業界，——允其是一般機製工業廠商，奠定了很堅强的基礎，而今後的工作，該如何切實地發展生產，推廣銷路，喚起全體人士，使都市農村及海外僑胞的任何一個人民，都有辨別購買國貨的處所，自然是更應加緊工作，努力進行，急須由我們產業界確定具體計劃，來逐漸使它積極實現的。</p>
<p>關於在這兩條進行錢上，最近國貨發展的動向，在這裏値得一提的，就是對於推廣邊區銷路這一方面，前星期有寗夏省主席馬鴻逵先生來滬，向國貨廠商接洽，將在那裏舉行一個國貨展覽會，使國貨進展至西北——西安，蘭州後，今更到邊陲最遠的寗夏去。對於開拓海外市塲這一方面，最近更聞中華國外貿易恊會，在積極籌備組織國外推銷團，並訓練人員，研究各種進行步驟，擬先赴南洋展覽，實施開拓國外市塲的新計劃。</p>
<p>歴史敎訓我們：「空言無補，事重實踐，」我們現在是只有從努力開拓海外市塲，和推廣邊區銷路——這兩條國貨的進行綫上，大家團結一致，共同合作，很勇敢地前進。</p>

<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>現代的一切科學上的新發明，一伴一件的供我人享用，這是多麼幸福的一件事？但是當我們安坐而享用這些科學的發明品時，我們該怎麽的紀念着發明這些東西的科學家呀？</p>
<p>每一科學家，發明一件東西，决不是只費一舉手之勞，便能成功的。歷史吿訴我們，有若干科學家，是窮年累月的把數年，或是數十年，甚至於畢生的光陰，都消費在試騐管裏，或是顯微鏡，或是其他的科學儀器之中的。而且也儘有研究了一世，尙未成功，而把未竟之功，交給後死者，或是下一世的科學家去研究而發明。這種研究的精神，似乎是有些兒其愚不可及也，為的是這麽窮畢生之精力，卽使有所發明，可是待到發明，自己巳是髮蒼視茫，在實際上，已是不能享受了。苦了自己，造化了別人，那豈不是天下的第一號大呆子。但是科學家們，却不是這麽想，他們只知有科學，願與科學共存亡，而終於把我們這個世界，進化到了今日那麽的物質文明。</p>
<p>例如說，不用鑽木，我們可假火柴以取火。不用點火，我們可用電燈以取光。這是多麽地便利？用一個瞧着是十分簡單的收音機，便能從空氣中，收得地珠的每一角上，所廣播出來的聲響。似乎一切聲響，就是在斗室中發出的多麽神奇？據說，這些年來，無錢電寫眞，也已有了相當的成就，這更是玄中玄，秘中秘，我輩只得咋舌而贊嘆着科學的偉大。再如說罷，關山萬里，可用火車汽車，縮短行程。大海重洋，可用巨輪，而乘風破浪，限期到達。那已是有些了不得。如今呢，後起之秀的飛機，像飛鳥凌空般的無遠不屆，數千里的程途，朝發夕至。偉大哉科學，眞是嘆觀止矣。</p>
<p>但是在這年頭兒，科學雖是那麽的發達，可是放在我們面前的，還儘有許多，期待着人類去發明。如天災的防止，疾病的治療，以至於星際的交通等等，在今後的若干世紀中，正需要着為入類造福的科學家們的努力。自然，我們的後代，對於科學化的物質享受，或許比了我們，不知將更幸福着若干倍呢。</p>

<p>— 黎光</p>
<p>日前偶讀韜奮先生的萍踪憶語，其中一段說：</p>
<p>有一次有一個美國中年婦人帶了一個小女兒到英國旅行，經友人的介紹，向我住的這個人家租了一個房間，說明住一星期。她和她的女兒來住以後，我因事忙，早出遲回，並未見過面。當晚房東老太太偶然和她談起我，承房東滿口讚譽，而這位美國婦入聽見有一個「材納門」（Chinaman）住在這家裏，雖則她從未見過面，談過話，卽毅然决然地對她（房東）說道：『我不能和「材納門」住在一個屋子裏！』第二天一早就忽忽忙忙地搬走。……房東老太太只是暗中詫異，覺得「材納門」何以這樣使人避若蛇蝎，使入這樣地厭惡痛恨！</p>
<p>碧眼兒瞧不起咱們黃帝子孫，已無待諱言。但絕不像那美國婦人的鄙視厭惡之極，或許韜奮先生意在激奮國人的覺醒，我未敢深信有這麼一回事。</p>
<p>一天，獨自散步於公園，瞥見一阿媽領着一小碧眼兒坐於蔭翳的大樹下的靠椅上休息着。忽然一個黃臉婆也帶一小兒（此小兒却不是碧眼的），行到大樹下，就坐在靠椅上的另一端。那小碧眼兒立卽扳起臉孔，裂開他的小嘴，帶斥責的口吻說：Get　awat　I　You　can't　sit　here　with　me　一那阿媽就為伊的小主子充作翻譯員，對那婦人說道：『他不歡喜你同坐在這兒，請你走開吧！』那婦入無奈，只得悻悻然走開去。</p>
<p>那時，我看見這種情况，悵然久之，何以一乳臭兒也驕妄得了不得呢？此正足以印證韜奮先生那段話的千眞萬確了。</p>

<p>第一回　品茗作清談夜窗聽雨　折柭驚艷花巷流芳</p>
<p>距今二十年前，革命軍初定江南，國歷絲毫不曾通行到社會。民間沿聽着幾千年來的風俗，兀自過着舊歷年。南京雖是江南一座大械，那人民的守舊性，是不下於內地任何城市。當正月燈節前後，人家門墻上，還留着鮮紅的宜春帖子，在細雨紛飛的陰天小巷子裏人家，在一字門墻中間，緊閉了雙門，將門上的紅春聯，平直着對了過路人，這是充分的表顯着過年的風味。天色快昏黑了，一位二十歲將近的靑年，穿了灰布棉袍，戴着鴨舌帽，左手夾着書包，右手撑了一柄靑布傘，由巷口進來。只聽他脚上的皮鞋，走在巷子地而的鵝卵石上，並沒有什麽重大的響聲，可以猜想出他走路之慢，下脚之輕。走到一所黑板門邊，他停了步，敲了幾下門環。門開了，是一位中年以上的太太出來了。當他看到這位靑年的時候，他憂鬱的臉上，立刻展開了笑容，先問道：今天回來得很晚，功課更忙嗎？靑年光叫了一聲媽，一面收起雨傘，一面問道。劉媽不在家嗎？怎麽讓媽自己來開門？老太太道：劉媽滿了工了，我讓他回去了。他說着話，關了大門，引兒子進去。市京的屋子，那構造總是一律的一條龍式。大的屋子，一進套着一進，可以到六七進。小的屋子，便是兩進，或一進半。這母子二人，是住在前進屋子裏，小小的三開間，配沿一個磚石天井。天井却是不小，有半截花台子，上面養了一叢天竹，和一棵彎着腰的小樹。因為這是春初，還看不出來是什麼樹。但這兩樣東西，到底是表示這人家，並不帶有那傖俗之氣的。由堂屋左邊的住房，直通連了那天井旁的廂房，成了一間長式的書房。靑年將傘放在外面，走進屋來，他的母親，也就捧了一盞煤油燈，跟着走進來了。少年呵喲一聲，兩手接住了燈，笑道：媽，你怎麽來伺候我？不該把劉媽辭了。這人作事也很謹愼的。老太太道：我並不是因為他作事不好，把他辭了。我想着，你若不在家，只有我一個人，什麼組細的事，我也全作得下，何必用一個人。工錢雖省得有限，一個工人的吃喝，一個月也很可觀，不用這個人，究竟每月能省下好幾塊錢。</p>

<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>年紅火管從這家牽連到那家，酒吧間，舞塲，咖啡店，旅邸……這些買醉和享樂的塲所，密佈在短短的朱葆三路兩旁。白天是靜悄悄的，像神志昏糊而沉寐着的濕溫症患者，夜晚便躁擾起來了，酒精，烟草，脂粉……混合的氣息，爵士樂，瘋在的笑，醉後放浪的話語……一直到午夜，到天明……</p>
<p>外國水兵戴着白布帽，有着紅紅的猴子般的臉，「哩哩啦啦」地從白漆玻璃門裹繁出來，一陣人力車衝上去，操着幾句强口的英吉利語；「先生，我拉你到碼頭回兵艦去。」「我拉你上窰子去：可是，那位文明國的勇士惱了，撩起拳頭扔在人力車夫的頸項裏。於是，人力車的陣列散退了「吱咕」地駡着。</p>
<p>凑上去的，是賣花的姑娘，頭髮是篷鬆的，擦着粗質的粉，不很入時的布旗衫，染有泥斑的皮鞋，乾燥的手拿一枝花儘往水兵領襟上扦，扦……糾纏着，文明國的勇士却並不惱，笑着醉紅的臉，打褲袋裏掏出銀幣來，扔在賣花姑娘手裏，扔在黑暗的水門汀牆角邊，於是，賣花姑娘笑了，似乎慶幸着利益的收獲。可是，這眞是伊們的收獲嗎？我們正不知有多少利益被人家收獲以去，現在扔下些微的渣粒，笑嗎？慶幸嗎？無知的賣花姑娘是不會明白的，在伊們，為圖生活的維持。而人力車夫是失敗了。</p>
<p>人力車夫認識了文明勇士的拳頭，甚至亭的刺刀，自已的血。</p>
<p>而第二枇外國水兵又從酒吧間瘋在地出來了，人力車夫，賣花姑娘，十歲左右的僕歐又凑上去。朱葆三路之夜是熱閙的，一直到天明……</p>
<h3 id="c165">男美於女 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 亦菴</p>
<p>男子的容貌美於女子，雖在美人濟濟的好萊塢也不能例外。在外表上，女子似乎比較美麗，可是事實並不如是，女子之所以看來似乎美麗者，靠的是化妝，頭髮的調整和衣服的形色。男子之所以似乎不及女子好看者，因為他們的頭髮都剪成一律，挽不出什麼可以調整容顏的花頭，所穿的衣服形式又是差不多的。假如你把女子的衣服穿得同男子一樣，頭髮也剪成男子的樣子，那時恐怕伊們會遠不如男子之來得動人了。一般事實上男子的眉，睫，皮色都較勝於女子，這是出於天賦的。在一個兒女很多的家庭裏頭，一定是兄弟們貌美於他們的姊妹。</p>
<p>這是「自然」的意思，不是我個人的見解。男子正如別種雄的動物一樣，他們的形狀是生成要來惹起異性的注意的，而女性則是配偶的選擇者。但是後來因為社會的演變，男子做了社會的主人翁，他們就把選擇配偶的權力也攘奪了過來，於是女子就不得不變為惹起異性注意的角色了—現在的情形，你看吧。</p>

<p>— 叔範</p>
<p>笋為竹萌，質嫩而潔，味永而清；以　盤餐，四時咸宜。自來安貧之士，灌園藝圃，盛稱菜根；不知蔬類滋味，淸靈弗厚，較諸出土犢尖，終遜一籌。今試以饌例人，則薤菘如山林　客，峭然微闕蘊藉。若笋，殆似田園野老之流，其氣龐樸，而仍不失幽逸蕭寒之風。下而若豚若膾，吧圓腥刺，直貪賈劣官之類耳，不足論巳。嘗過僧寮，當落花時節，乞食齋廚，馨芬浮筋，無　不雜黃犢角；迴腸繞舌，覺人間至味無復加矣！而寺僧猶歉然曰：衲千長餚餉客，幸恕慢！私念市上方千錢一斤，視若上珍，貧家得薦新者，尙百無一二，而緇流已日飫且厭；循此推論，僧伽何處不超人世，寗徒名山被佔多而巳哉？吾因是有慕乎逃禪。</p>
<p>曩客富春，主盛枚封孝廉家，秫酒三斗，縱我醉嘯。時江上荻芽方肥，山中林　正綻，其老僕　雲鋤露，日擷以佐盤者，宛然雪藕。緣是處居民，以織紙為生，十畝之間閑閑者，恃竹而不重桑。故緣江縈坡，猗猗風淸，每値春三，滿地怒茁；視笋猶嶺南之於檳榔，湘湖之於蒪菜，取求較魚蝦便過多多也。而吾亦安之，澹忘諸味。有時坐到春星殘碧，薄寒暈上燈花，老僕知吾嗜飲，出餘酷，為解料峭；父恐下酒味劣，更拮籬角坼土纖纖者數枚，帶　入松火炙之；微焦剝食，甘芬鎖舌本，不數古寺煨芋，囂衢聚票；覺向之日陷而津津者，猶未盡善盡美。於是吾又發願，何日得結廬於春江一曲間也。</p>
<p>甲戌之春，余旋里小憇，頗揭溪泊之閟。一日，自燭溪湖陟許郞山，而上窮流源，止於戚姓。重巒如甕，日色都綠，古木無數，　　者擢翠其間。撫倚巡視，紫芽紛觸履；亦有一二新篁，方舒　隕粉，展其天機；度高，織綠過襟腰爾。念一物滋生之艱如此，何忍多所踐陒。：因佇聽泉之流，禽之鳴，松與風之和而吟，寄耳目焉。亭午進餐，山家斷魚肉，絕春釀，恣吾腹者，有香稻一甑，笋　滿缶。日斜點飢，更出筍脯，至甘且淸，覺江上之所嘗者，又不足數矣。其明晨，宿露未晞，採野芝盈筥，和笋燖之；則甘者且醇，色轉如珀，洞客之所餐耶？上仙之所遺耶？太和之味，無得而名，吾於是渴慕乎山居。</p>
<p>余家亦小具園圃，開簾有叢　一籬，猗然而茂者，童年寢讀處焉。憶春闌，每見吾姊劇笋過，必低呼曰：餐次乞留少許！遂以為常。亦有幸而免斧斤者，見其由咫而尺，由　而葉，必默識之。今日纔及窗者，易宿視之，已小礙日影矣；無何，越　而上，拂簷牙；及夏，且能招展凉風矣。偶對之，輒作痴想：使我而竹者，將日與羣蟬狎也。時淸音方嘒，目冉冉偷注，弗自己。比落江湖，此夢邈矣—間或心頭溫過，亦祗餘痕一霎耳。客臘歸省，見姍姍者，都花而實，念竹老始菽，衰之象也，亦猶吾之髮褪靑，而髯日就蒼乎？今者春事垂暮，遙想富春江畔，燭溪湖頭，紫笋父當怒綻；而吾道塗飢驅，仍栖皇未息，息，意者歸山之願，必待頭白始了耶？</p>

<h3 id="c190">上海英國學校槪况（四） <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 胡祖蔭</p>
<p>在實質方面，平時訓練有下列數種：</p>
<p>宗敎訓練　每日上午八時三刻至九時，全校學生均須排隊到禮拜堂參加早禱。牧師常在早禱時，將基督教義及做人方法講解給學生聽。</p>
<p>集合訓練　每次上課時各級學生均須先到雨操塲集合集合。時由體育指導主持排隊。吹第一决警笛時，全體學生必須靜止不講話；吹第二决警笛時，各級學生必須排好，依决入敎室。排隊時如有學生不守秩序者，將共姓名記下，於星期一下午將其留置反省室半小時，促其自省。</p>
<p>童子軍訓練　童子軍訓練現為大多數英國學校所施行。該校過去對於童子軍訓練頗著相當的成績。該校童子軍現已正式編入上海西人童子軍團；過去參加西人童子軍活動亦有良好結果。該校校長會指定一空，專爲童子軍活動和辦公之用。</p>
<p>學長訓練學長（Prefect）訓練是英國公立學校中一種特殊的訓練。這種訓練的目的是在訓練各級中一兩個品學兼優的學生，請他們襄助學校維持同學間的秩序，同時在各方面為學校做各種服務的工作。有許多英國學校能保持良好的校風多半是得着學長忠心的服務。</p>
<p>五、促進學生學業和自修辦法</p>
<p>雖然該校所採用的敎學方法多牛是普通的，但是該校對於學生的學業却是非常地注重。在前節已經說過，該校敎師每月舉行月會一决。在月會中，每個級訓導須將一月中每生各科的成績報吿校長。在這張成績單上，除有全級學生各科分數以外，還將各生各科成績的名次排列出來；同時亦將該生上月各科成績的名决列出，以資比較。假如某生上月某科的成績是第三，而本月份同科成績的名决忽然降到第十五；該科敎帥就要找出該生成绩退步的原因。假如該生是囚為懶惰而致學業成績退步，校長就將他叫全校長室向他警吿；同時在星期五下午四時至五時將他留置校中，請該科敎師督促他補做功課。假如該生仍不肯用功補習，且無進步，校長就要將他叫至校長室笞之以杖，同時吿知他的家長共同督促。據該校校長說，此種體罰的方法有時頗有效騐。</p>
<p>關於該校促進學生在家自修的方法也値得在此處介紹。英國現有一班敎育家和議員提倡廢止兒童在家的自修工作，而主張設法令兒童在校中做好第二日要準備的功課。該校願未能廢除學生在家自修的工作，但是却能設法盡量地减少，同時對於學生自修的方法亦加以適當的指導。該校對於預科兩年（即高小）的學生可以說沒有正式規定的自修工作；有時僅有極少份量的非正式的自修工作。對於中學第一年的學生，每日只有一種規定的自修工作。中學第一年學生每日只有二種規定的自修工作。中學第三年起至第六年止學生每日至多只有三種規定的自修工作。該校所以能有此種精密的規定就是因爲各級各科教師事先會有一種磋商，將全部的學生自修工作均勻地分配在一週間，可使學生不致於某晚太忙或某晚太空。在該校各級功課時間表上，，另有一行空白可以塡寫各級學生每晚的自修工作；敎師將這張表揭示在敎室內，全體擊生當然可以有所遵循了。</p>

<p>金鷄繼續下跌　標紗前市開聲、各朋繼續下挫、形勢軟化、蓋以本月交貨籌碼充足、倉庫囤積已達三萬包以外、所以人氣不振、市價緩步下落、結果各月以上日收盤價均跌六·七角、午後開盤、本月仍屬平庸、但有一部份多頭開始掉期、因此近疲遠緊、結果近月比上午收盤價跌二角、遠漲一·三角、查賣出昌記七百包、遠記七百包、明德四百五十包、振大四百五十包、賡豐七百五十包、森廉一千包、仁豐七百五十包、同和一千八百包、信減一千四百包、經華四百五十包、買進豪興七百包、德大七百包、大豐一千五百五十包、愼記一千三百五十包、泰昌八百包、長豐八百包、裕大四百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份初疲繼復稍堅之象、洋麥報價、芝加哥回跌四五六角不等、坎拿大跌四五角、開價時人心曾見軟弱、以後則因多空觀望、賣戶更少、致各月份又復回穩、查新粉行市、如此高昂、拋者反不如往年之盛、大致仍屬貨幣問題、內地不肯胃險耳、迨至下午開盤、交易更清、價則與上午收盤相仿、因廠方觀望、業外更少拋售、是以盤旋不動、後步如天時良好、仍看定局云、</p>
<p>麥市上午開盤後、各月份呈初平繼穩之態、開價時因洋麥報價頗巨、人心平疲、旋以拋戶反寂、粉市又見銷佳、喊價遂提升一二分、迨至下午開盤、交易異常清淡、價與上午相仿、聞空頭方面尙有空出、餘若津浦滬寗等帮、均一無動靜、市面之沉寂、當屬此故、現麥市面仍然平定、五無軒輊、開出山東宿州麥五元三角二分、計一千餘包、由福新辦去云、</p>

<h3 id="c228">廣州重視「賢母良妻」敎育 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 家爲</p>
<p>記得是一年多以前了：大槪廣東當局是關懷着那裏的婦女界，所以我們接連的在報紙上讀到了許多關於那方面努力於各種婦女問題的消息。比方說，下令禁止「男女同浴」，「男女同行」，以至「同食」，「同床」等等——這都是爲着維護女子們的尊敬（？）與注重於當地的「風化吧」！</p>
<p>最近的報紙上我們又讀到一個新的消息了；那裏現在正注重着女子們的敎育呢！據報所載！他們正預備遣派了女子師範的校長等諸人，特地出國東渡，去考察我們同文同種的「大日本」國裏的女子敎育；而允其是注重於「賢母良妻」的敎育。然而，那裏的師範學生却羣起反對，同時，印發着致她們的校長先生的宣言。言詞很激昻，頗得人同情云。</p>
<p>眞的，那裏果然沒有放鬆着對於婦女們的一切問題，可惜我們沒有機會讀得學生們反對的宣言；不知道她們的立論與主張究竟怎樣。不過，在我們就事論事的說來，今日廣州當局的要注重於「賢母良妻」制敎育，却並不偶然的。</p>
<p>誰都知道的吧，「賢母良妻」制原是封建社會裏私有制度下的產物。因此，牠是正得處於社會制度的同一命運之下，跟隨着封建社會的崩潰而崩潰了。所以，跟着偉大的「五四運動」，中國的婦女們在社會上是獲得相當的勝利——突破了家庭的鏈鎖，走向着社會的大道。</p>
<p>不過，事情終於沒有如人望的那樣簡單而容易：在初期的，不澈底的革命運動之下，根深蒂固的封建餘孽，在帝國中義的庇護與利用之下，終於到處給頑强地猖獗了起來，而形成了我們今日這個「半殖民半封建的社會」！</p>
<p>所以，在不久，在德國希特勒的獨裁鐵腕之下，產生了一個「三K運動」——德語孩子，廚房，敎堂三字的第一個字母——而唱出了「婦女的天職在敎養子女」（希氏在國社黨運動中的婦女大會上語）的「新賢母良妻制」。繼着，在我國，我們也就聽到有一部份人出來高唱起「婦女回到家庭去」的口號了。</p>
<p>雖然，這種口號在當前我們的社會動態正急劇地變轉着的情勢之下，是顯露着那樣的幼稚與渺小。但是，在今日廣州當局一貫的禁令着「男女同浴」，「同行」…等的設施之卞，來注重於這「新賢母良妻」制度，正可說得一句是「天經地義」的事吧！何况，在這「大日本帝國裏」，他們那婦女們的「善良」，而永遠作着男子們的「侍侯者，」原是世界聞名的啊！所以，在今日日本統治當局一貫地努力着保存這個光榮的「國粹」，而更在各「文明國」人士的仰慕與贊嘆之下，終於給廣州當局作爲「他山之石」而特爲遣派許多學者去那裏考察了！</p>
<p>不過，在這樣矛盾的情勢之下，我們却眞有些不敢設想：他們這樣「努力着」，是預備把今日的時代要拉回到什麼年頭去？而「大中華民國」以來一些可憐的「婦女運動」的萌芽，與所獲得的些微浮面的，局部的「平權」，眞得這樣無情地給拋去黑暗的汪洋大海而不顧嗎？在我們這個所謂「革命的策源地」！</p>
<h3 id="c229">搶親 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 新野</p>
<p>—鄕俗剪誌—</p>
<p>春天的朝陽很嫵媚地在原野里舖着，晨風瓢來了醉人的淸香；梅花村就這樣的陶醉在那溫柔的大自然里。</p>
<p>村子里是靜悄悄的，只有這條環繞着村子的玉帶似底小河中，却有幾對鴨子在綠楊蔭下浮游嬉戲。天氣雖則已經春暖了，可是，那週遭的田野里却是找不出一個農人的影子來，祇是一些菜花荳花在空氣中播送着一種寂寞的芬芳。</p>
<p>雙觀音堂上的戲開鑼的第一天，那些村人都闔家的去觀看；士婆四是在城隍廟前擺了一個點心攤，趕做戲塲上臨時買賣的，所以他老夫妻倆一淸早就起身到攤頭上去整頓佈置了，只剩下他那個十九歲的女兒阿英在家里做飯：</p>
<p>「阿英，你在家里吃了飯來，我們的飯菜你裝在飯籃里送來好了。」土婆四的老婆，臨走的時候這樣地可囑着她。</p>
<p>太陽過橫了東方，村子里的男女老小都吃了早飯到戲塲上去了，卽有幾條比較玲瓏而活潑的狗子，也夾了一條尾巴，跟着牠們的主人去軋熱閙了。</p>
<p>在早些年，年勢好的時光，本來，這雙觀音堂上每年的春秋二季總要演兩次戲的，而且演一决至少是三台；但是近來幾年的年頭眞不行，這雙觀音堂也就一連停了十來年的鑼。難得今年王鄕長肯發起來做兩臺戲，這自然要使這班已經十年沒有過着戲癮的鄕下人起勁得瘋狂　般了。</p>
<p>那條出入總匯的大官路上，行人漸漸地稀疎起來，雙觀音堂上也在開始打閙塲了；那響亮的鑼鼓聲很淸晰的飄過了梅花村，飄過了蔡母嶺，飄過了顧家埠，使一些還在家里裝扮或給孩子喂奶，換衣的娘兒們慌忙起來，使一些已經走在路上的也加快了脚步。這時阿英也趕緊將飯菜裝好了，準備自家兒穿好了衣服上戲塲去。</p>
<p>「阿英，戲已經在開臺了！」黃頭三娘子攙了孩子，站在門口向阿英催促。</p>
<p>「好了，你進來等一等我吧！」阿英一面將一副絞絲式的銀鐲子套在手腕上，一面在房里回答她。</p>
<p>「不，我要先走了，你來吧，我帶了小人是走不快的。」她說着却頭也不回顧的從樸樹底下走了過去。</p>
<p>村中是一刻一刻的靜寂下來，人也越走越光了，雖然有幾家還留個把年老身弱的老人在守家，可却是躱在屋子里，屋外祇有菜園邊上的幾隻老母鷄，照例地領着一羣雛鷄在太陽下悠閒地散着步。</p>
<p>這時從村梢頭望到蔡母嶺上，在那條曲折的山徑上這時正有幾個人抬着一乘布幔小轎，在向這村里來。</p>
<p>轎子到了村里，便在土婆四家的門前停下了，從轎廂里走出一個戴灰色呢帽，穿黑色馬褂，藍色長袍的靑年來，四個轎夫却不動聲色的在牆邊站着。那靑年抬頭朝着那扇古老的牆門望望，便闖了進去。</p>
<p>—碰—碰—另外一個轎夫等那靑年進了門之後，就把帶來的小爆竹燃放了一個。</p>
<p>阿英已經穿扮好了，正想鎖上了房門提着飯籃出門，陡的聽到了兩下淸脆的聲響，這不覺使她突然震了一驚。但等到她提着飯籃衝出門來時，却見一個陌生靑年正朝着她闖過來，他臉上現着一層猙獰可怕的笑容：她要想迴避，已經來不及，早已給他像餓鷹抓小鷄似的撲了過來摟住了，接着她呌喊了一聲，四個轎夫也擁到了里面。</p>
<p>她扔了手中的飯籃，掙扎，嘶喊，踢打，哭駡，但有點什麼用呢？她給他們這一羣七手八脚，扛扛抬抬的推進了轎子里面，那個靑年也一同坐了進去，把她緊緊地抱着。任她去哭駡打踢，他却帶笑地說：</p>
<p>「瘋什麽呢？你旣然是我的老婆了，早晚是要嫁給我的」，他說着俏皮地將她的腰肢摟了摟緊。「我本來是要好好的來娶你的啊，爲什麽你的爸媽這樣的不講理呢？哼！現在看你們賴婚可賴得成不？……」她還儘是哭罵打踢，和不住地掙扎，轎夫們却笑着在打趣。</p>
<p>「好了，已經到手啦！還要强什麽，到了晚上你却笑也來不及呢？哈！哈！哈……」</p>
<p>—碰—碰—小爆竹又響了兩聲，轎子就抬着走了。</p>
<p>老母鷄給驚得領着雛羣躱進了竹園里，村里剩下的那條癩皮狗却不住的狂吠着，—那個寗靜的村子頓時起了一陣騷動，使幾個看家的老太婆，和那拐了一條腿的五叔都跑過來看了，但是搶婚，在梅巷村里是沒有人敢干涉的。</p>
<p>—砰啦…砰啦！轎子當要走上蔡母嶺時，轎窗上的坡璃却給她擊破了兩塊，她的手上泊泊地淌着鮮血，轎底板也給蹬得蓬蓬價響，使轎杠震得轎夫們的肩頭發痛。</p>
<p>「殺千刀的……哎，……你們要天火燒的……哎！嗎！爸呀！」這聲音漸漸地遠了。</p>

<p>櫻花節</p>
<p>三月下句至四月上旬是櫻花盛開的時節，是日本風習上莫名其妙的狂醉的時節啊！</p>
<p>在這樣的時候，一般小市民階級的</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>男女老幼都絡繹地到櫻花名地去買醉，携着飯盒子啦，酒啦，什麽生菓餅物之類啦。那期間電車廂裏塞得緊緊的，假如有急事，你或者寗可站着給人擠不願意坐下去，因爲下車時，鑽扒出來也相當辛苦的。但鐵路局的收入，是一年中最滿意的日子。</p>
<p>就隨便到一個櫻花盛開的地方去玩玩看吧，稻田堤也好，小金井也好。</p>
<p>在途上，可看見給一兩個人扶着，或獨個兒顚顚歪歪地走着，嘶聲唱着什麼歌曲的醉漢。</p>
<p>走到那地方時，如同神話中的魔窟似的。不但要提防耳朶沒給那些玩把戲的鑼鼓，管鈸，以及嘶聲唱或呌的雜聲震裂，走着時還要留神那些醉漢撲過來獰笑地拉着你走，或者沒給他們拿着的酒瓶碰上腦袋或什麼地方，同時還要沒給那些顚狂的女入推倒（我曾在稻田堤的木橋上差點兒沒給一羣女人推擠下橋去，但頭上的帽子却已飛下水面，像一個圓形的小汽艇似的在風送中滑走着，幸而有一位漢子划出泊在岸邊的小艇子追上抓了回來，然而我白花掉一角錢的報酬了）。在滿枝怒放着潔白中帶些微紅的櫻花的倩影下，有的圍坐着酌酒，有的醉沉沉的狼藉地睡着，有花面粉臉的男女唱着歌跳舞，有的玩什麼滑稽的把戲。但也有給你休息的，也是做生意人正逢機運的臨時擺設的茶亭，生菓舖……。你可以坐着悠然地放目溜覽那種種色色的景象，尤其是中年婦人跟男漢混在一起唱唱跳跳，或挽着臂兒一拖一推的走着，以及一些躺在草地上像弔唁又像在喜得喪失了靈魂似的老婆子哼出奇妙的歌聲，或者老是蜷動着，呢喃着，赤紅的臉绷着一絲絲的不知什麼意味的笑紋。</p>
<p>現在又正是櫻花時節了，想不會因什麼政變，社會的動亂及種種恐慌而影響到這狂醉的時節吧？</p>
<h3 id="c231">殺烏記 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 耳禾</p>
<p>自從决定將孔林改爲孔林公園後，幾十年來住宿在孔林裏的烏便成了可憎厭的東西了。孔林在學校的前面，孔林的南邊是一條很闊的泥山河。一向，孔林是十分荒蕪的，除了數十株古柏及四五株合抱的烏柏外便只有滿地的茅草了。在冬天，孔林幾乎成爲烏的大本營。牠們展着黑色的翅膀，盤旋着，哀號着。當我初到這兒的時候，我就害怕着，我從來沒有看見有這麼多的烏的，牠們像一大隊無組織的兵士，將孔林全部佔據下來了。爲了身體的不健全，早上或晚上我總要出外走一會，但一走出校門，牠們的無休止的絮聒，以及成團的黑色的影子深深的襲擊着我的心，使我不安，使我感到有大禍立刻降下來似的。但住在這兒的人，似乎絲亳無動於中，這也許是已成了習慣的緣故吧？</p>
<p>這樣，孔林的給烏統治已是幾十年來的事情了。（也許是數百年來的事情呢。）但厄運終於降臨到烏的身上了。去年冬天，有人主張將孔林整理一下，搬些花卉石凳進去，泥山河裏又可蕩蕩小舟，使荒蕪的孔林變成一個可以怡情適性的地方未始不是一件美事。於是今年春天就從事整理的工作了。將茅草除去，花卉培種了後，便覺非殺烏不可了。可是烏已不知費了許多心血築好了巢預備繁殖牠們的子孫了。單就四五株合抱的烏柏而言，巢，已有三四十個了。其他築在古柏上的大的，小的，總計不下百餘個。</p>
<p>一個傍晚，孔廟的東南角立滿了學生，大家用好奇的眼光瞧着孔林裏的烏巢，他們都知道將有什麽事發生了。那時滿臉堆着笑的趙先生用着賊子那樣的脚步靜悄悄的蹲伏在烏柏底下，烏，都零亂地從遠方歸來了。牠們在樹際盤旋了一會，終於停息在烏柏上了。於突然拍拍拍…」的幾響，在學生的喧鬧中三隻烏跌下來了。幹前去一看，知道槍彈都中在腹部，殷紅的血滴在泥上却變成黑色了。未死的烏都像臨陣脫逃的兵士慌張地，驚恐地展着黑色的翅膀，一點，一點，在半空裏盤旋，哀號。可是下面却有歡笑聲以及三隻死了的烏。</p>
<p>第二天有好多隻烏在孔林的四周探視着，見了人便飛去了，第三天還是這樣，第四第五天…，於是又聚在孔林裏了，大家覺得不妥，要求趙先生再來一次屠殺。於是在昏黑的夜裏又是突然「拍拍拍…」的幾響電筒照射起來的時侯，又看見四隻死了的烏。翌晨，又遣僕人將長竹竿把烏巢完全打毀，於是有無數的烏蛋摔碎在地上…。</p>
<p>這羣烏將到什麽地方去呢？每家的住宅上是不許牠們築巢的。（這兒的風俗，認爲宅上有烏巢是不幸的。）可是牠們要有歸宿，要繁殖子孫。去尋沒人管理的荒林吧，可是荒林有多少呢？於是我爲烏悲哀了。</p>
<p>如今孔林的四周已有鐵鉛絲圍住了，林內有木椅，石凳，和各種花卉，泥山河裏有蕩漾的輕輕的小舟，人們絡釋不絕…，孔林，的確成爲孔林公園了。每一個遊人的心裏都充滿了喜悅，他們卽使有心事，卽使有悒鬱和痛苦，但若想起那幕殺烏的悲劇恐怕沒有幾個人吧？然而畢竟是眼前事，徜徉在烏柏古柏的旁邊，在閒談中也許有人會提到殺烏的事的。然而三年四年，十年二十年，殺烏的事在每一個人的腦海中磨滅了時，人們便只會玩賞或談其他的荒誕故事了。</p>

<p>— 白木</p>
<p>有人說過王引是硬漢，這原因無疑地是因為他在歷來所演各片中，扮飾着所謂粗錢條一類角色的緣故。自然假使是耍認眞玫其根據的話，我相信是不會有人說得出道理來的。事實上，這種觀念完全錯誤，王引不但不是硬漢，簡直就是一個十足標準的軟漢，然而這有什麼根據呢？有的，卽將公映的藝華有聲新片，方沛霖導演「化身姑娘」便是最好沒有的鐵證，只消看他在袁美雲，周璇，許曼麗三位小姐面前東跪西跪的幾個鏡頭，已足够像心靈坐在沙發椅上一樣，感到說不盡的爽快舒適，同時也就承認王引的的確確不是硬漢，而且完全相反的一個軟漢了。</p>

<p>洪深編劇，程步高導屆的「新舊上海」，是老早給了我們绝大的注意的，在很順利的工作進行之後，很快地它是已經全部完成了。在一個下着細雨的春之夜裏，「新舊上海」到中央初試，冒雨而來的參觀人是滿了座，是誰都懷着一重興奮的心情。</p>
<p>「新舊上海」以一個有趣的演出博取了觀　的微笑，但那個有趣的演出的後面，便是張着一張淡淡的灰幕，最明顯的便是到處的不景氣呵不景氣。朱秋痕和顧梅君一對舞女是常常碰見了跳了舞溜走的舞客；謝云聊正要推銷一堂木器，坐汽車的幾位貴客來了，可是他們是來出售家里的木器的：汽車夫尤光照的東家破了產，失業；王獻齊服務絲廠倒閉了，也是失業；而空得慌的弄堂房子，又有人設法做贈品打拆扣地誘房客。</p>
<p>故事產生在一座二上二下的房子的幾個房客間，在細部的　寫中間大量地容入着趣味，有一個最顯明的諷刺便是上海人那種有錢裝窮，沒錢裝闊的神秘心理，王獻　失了　，猶裝着大模大樣吃着「紅燒蹄膀」「豆腐漿」的吃得神氣活現，可是一旦中了一條二彩五千元的航空獎券，馬上設計着要裝着上一决典當，要法搬到亭子間去住，「紅燒蹄膀」「豆腐漿」也忍住饞不吃……可是後來錢莊倒了，存欵一古腦兒落了空時，偏又闊了起來……。</p>
<p>至於導演，收音，攝影，演員……的俊秀成績，讀者一定自己會予他們非常的信任，這裏的介紹是無庸的。</p>

<p>（一）參觀難</p>
<p>在日本有許多數工廠。我們不得進去參觀。允其關於軍需相關的工塲。祇得望門興歎。看看烟突吧。為的在日本政府軍需工業動員法管理之下。戰時政府有權轉用或管理一切軍需工塲。所以工廠中有一部份在試騐改製軍火或軍需品。準備戰時。立刻可變作兵工廠。關於政府如何規定工廠臨時改製軍火或軍用品辦法。且看下面幾個例子。便知道了。</p>
<p>鋼鍊製造工業　改製彈子</p>
<p>鑽刨機械設備之各種工業　改鑽彈丸</p>
<p>鋼琴製造工業　改製火藥盒</p>
<p>引擎機械工業　改製機關槍</p>

<p>英國運輸部大臣李思廉華畢立歇氏。最近在倫敦無錢電臺作廣播演說。渠稱一九三五年時。因運輸部從事於道路安全運動之結果。車輛肇禍而未被犧牲之性命。其數逾八百云。又據華畢立歇氏稱。一九三五年中。每日道路上增加之新汽車。平均計之。其數雖逾四百五十輛。但肇禍事件祗有六千五百二十一起。一九三四年為七千三百四十三起。因車輛肇禍而受傷者。一九三五年為二八一，七九八人。一九三四年則多至二三一，六〇三人。</p>
<p>運輸大臣華氏對於此事。謂每輛汽車之肇禍比率跌落。多年以來。此决尚係破題兒第一朝云。由統計上之數字觀之。一九三四年時。每一〇〇〇輛汽車肇禍而致人生命傷亡者。達九十九人。一九三五年其數下降。每千輛汽車已低落至八十七人。因之華畢立歇氏甚冀全國人民。一致努力。俾一九三六年在交通方面。成為眞正的平安之年云。華氏續謂。余深望一九三六年之公共安全乃為最卓越之一種工作。一九三五年肇禍事件之咸少。已證明普通之决心。得令全國免去損失不少。各地民衆注意並促進各種交通上之設備。如交通燈火。行人穿越口·欄柵·及警告記號等。但有一事决不可以漠視者。卽人事上之注意。較諸機械之束縛。有力萬分也。</p>
<p>華畢立歇氏於廣播之夜又稱。今晚在空氣中傾聽演說者。其人數當不下二，五〇〇，〇〇〇。渠深冀大衆能切實瞭解。如各人能對於各種道路規律。嚴加注意。則其安全之增進。必更甚矣。又聞近日運輸部。尚擬完成一種更擴大之　　　數、其計劃中之一端。即為將道路安全之方法。強迫灌注於各學校兒童之腦中。以為學課中必修之一種。凡屬英國之學校。均將實行此項策劃。一九三五年因肇禍之發生而令人傷亡者。其數雖减少八百人。但華畢立歇氏以為在成千累萬之傷亡數目中。祇得减少如許。尚不能令人感得滿意云。</p>

<p>— Wei</p>
<p>The current situation in North China, from its superficial observation, may appear to be temporarily static. However, the expansion of the garrison troops, the planned operation of the Cangshi Railway, the planned mining of the Longyan Coal Mine, the planned establishment of a steel plant in Tangshan, Pingxi, the planned large-scale construction of the Hebei-Chahar highway network, and the planned opening of a northern ice-free port all prove that foreign forces are still developing in North China based on their consistent policy of "military action" and "economic development" going hand in hand. Due to the difference in procedures, the steps are slow or fast. This is the flexible application of their policy, not giving China a chance to catch its breath.</p>
<p>Economically speaking, North China is not only a region rich in mineral resources in our country but also the region that produces the most cotton. Only the cotton field area and output of Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces, which are most suitable for planting cotton, account for an average of more than one-third of the country's total over the years. The occupation of the three northeastern provinces is also part of the Kwantung Army's plan to expand the cotton planting area in Manchuria to supply its domestic textile industry. However, due to the unsuitability of the land and climate, the results of the past three years have proved that the promotion of cotton planting has been unsuccessful. According to foreign statistics, the cotton field in the three northeastern provinces was 122,500 acres in 1933, with an output of 120,000,000 pounds; in 1934, it was 200,000 acres, but the output was only 156,340,000; in 1935, it was 118,300 acres, and the output was only 90,000,000 pounds. These few numbers, in addition to being consumed by the farmers in the eastern provinces themselves, can be transported out for industrial use in very small quantities. In order to obtain cotton raw materials, it is inevitable that Japan will shift its attention to North China. Japan takes Tianjin as its agricultural center and provides North China farmers with technical and economic assistance, as well as encouraging farmers to grow cotton. The so-called economic cooperation and the so-called development of North China are all focused on this.</p>
<p>Therefore, the so-called economic development is just another name for obtaining raw materials. With the abundance of resources and the large population of North China, in economic terms, it can not only solve the shortage of domestic raw materials but also serve as a vent for the dumping of its surplus commodities. Japanese industrial products are inexpensive due to their low labor costs and inferior quality, making it impossible for European and American products to compete with them. Therefore, yellow trade has long had an overwhelming trend. In addition, since foreign forces have penetrated into North China, smuggling has been rampant. Although the Chinese customs has worked hard to combat smuggling, due to the restrictions of the Tanggu Agreement in North China and the establishment of the puppet autonomy, the Chinese local authorities in these areas have long been unable to intervene. The source of smuggled goods is transported from these areas to warehouses in the Tianjin Concession, and then distributed by the warehouses to merchants in various places. Customs officers know that they cannot arrest smugglers, and some are resisted by smugglers with force. Even if they are found and confiscated, they are often interfered with by the garrison troops. According to customs statistics, the value of goods smuggled into the country last year reached 210 million yuan. In the first, second, and third months of this year, even more goods were smuggled into the country, with a value of at least 100 million yuan. Under these circumstances, due to the rampant smuggling, Japanese commodities enjoy tax evasion, and the cost comparison with other countries' commodities is naturally very different. The exclusive occupation of the North China market by goods is inevitable. At the same time, the impact on China's customs revenue is also to be expected. As a result, not only will it affect China's finances, but also the foreign debt guarantee will be a problem. Some say that certain foreigners' encouragement of smuggling and destruction of China's customs administration still have a major goal. Because China's Inspector General of Customs has always been held by the British, the position is important and has long been coveted by certain foreigners. Recently, the reason for disregarding international credibility and encouraging smuggling in every possible way is to create a foundation for demanding this position. In short, people's schemes against us are all-pervasive, and it is not only the customs administration that is the target. The seizure of the customs administration is only a small part of it.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Li Zilosin made a speech in Shanghai, saying that China should avoid currency inflation and pay attention to rural construction. According to responsible officials of the Ministry of Finance, this ministry is now striving to balance the revenue and expenditure of the national treasury. The Central Bank has in fact gradually become a reserve bank. Regarding rural construction, such as ordering the Farmers Bank to handle agricultural loans with 50 million yuan, other banks also have preparations for investing in rural areas. This ministry has long paid attention to this, urging the financial community and all parties to move forward and work hard to develop. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance responded to reporters' inquiries on the 21st about his thoughts on Li Zilosi's speech, saying that the knight came to China this time to investigate China's economy, traveling north and south, and working extremely hard, which we admire very much. However, his claim that the Chinese government's promise to promote the independence of the Central Bank system should be implemented as soon as possible, and that the revenue and expenditure of the national treasury should be balanced as soon as possible to avoid currency inflation and pay attention to the rural economy, is exactly what we are now doing to meet his expectations. The amendment to the Central Bank as the Central Reserve Bank was drafted by Finance Minister Kong and sent to the Executive Yuan for transfer to the Central Political Committee for review. However, this matter is of great importance, and the Central Political Committee needs time to study it. After the review and approval is completed and the legislative procedure is completed, the Central Reserve Bank can be realized. Regarding balancing the revenue and expenditure of the national treasury, the government has an overall plan and has been implementing it step by step, but it will take a considerable amount of time to see results. The so-called policy of avoiding currency inflation, as a means of balancing the revenue and expenditure of the national treasury, is the government's consistent proposition. Since the implementation of the new currency policy, the government has never abused the issuance of one-yuan legal tender. As for paying attention to the rural economy, the government is working hard to move forward. In addition to ordering the China Farmers Bank to allocate 50 million yuan first to relieve the rural areas, the Ministry of Industry is also preparing to establish a Rural Capital Bureau to provide large-scale relief.

In general, in light of the League of Nations' failure to protect Abyssinia, people are gradually realizing that it is difficult to achieve the goal of defending peace on a global scale.

<p>Mexico City, Mexico: Mexico previously announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations due to financial difficulties (this was in 1932), and then immediately declared its re-entry. It is now about to announce its withdrawal again. According to the latest news reports, based on the opinions of the members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives, this move could be decided on Wednesday. "The League of Nations is a costly and ineffective organization, and its demise is not far off. After Paraguay implemented its withdrawal in February of last year, other Latin American countries will inevitably follow suit. This organization failed to provide any assistance in handling the disputes between China and Japan and the Chaco War. Recently, it has been at a loss for what to do about the dispute between France and Germany. What it does is no different from a puppet, and it cannot continue to deceive people for long. Its absurdity and darkness have been seen through by the world." (Havas dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The results of today's Executive Council meeting have created an unfavorable impression, as the debate did not reveal genuine unity among the member states. The speeches of British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Cabinet member Pang Gu allow one to see the differences in their opinions. Observers believe that the cracks in the structure of the League of Nations are almost visible at a glance. Before the resolution was passed, all members of the Executive Council made speeches, and it was heard that several countries, including South American countries, opposed placing the blame for undermining reconciliation on any one party. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Executive Council of the League of Nations continued its non-public meeting at 6:40 PM today and then held a public meeting at 10:10 PM, at which it unanimously passed a resolution to record the failure of the mediation of the Italy-Abyssinia dispute, stating:</p>
<p>Full Text of the Resolution</p>
<p>"The Executive Council hereby takes note of the report submitted by the Committee of Thirteen. The Committee previously applied on March 3 for Italy and Abyssinia to swiftly cease hostilities and restore peace within the framework of the League of Nations and in accordance with the spirit of the Covenant of the League of Nations, and the Executive Council hereby ratifies this. It should also be noted that the Abyssinian government accepted the commencement of peace talks on March 5 in order to resolve the dispute. It is regrettable that the reconciliation work ultimately failed, and the war not only failed to stop but continued, which is in conflict with the Covenant of the League of Nations and has been declared as such. Therefore, the various obligations stipulated by the Covenant must be implemented. In view of this, the Executive Council hereby makes a final appeal to the Italian government. As a founding member of the League of Nations, and in the current situation where cooperation between countries is most urgent, the country should demonstrate a spirit to resolve the dispute and live up to the expectations of the League of Nations. Furthermore, all countries signed a protocol on June 17, 1925, mutually prohibiting the use of poisonous gas, and there are also other international protocols signed successively regarding methods of warfare. Both Italy and Abyssinia are signatories to these documents and are bound by them. All countries that participate in these documents should abide by them, which is what the Executive Council values."</p>
<p>When the resolution was put to a vote, only Italy voted against it, but since the country is a party to the dispute, its vote was not counted. After the resolution was passed, the representative of Ecuador, Chaldermik, stood up and spoke, stating a reservation that the country had already canceled sanctions against Italy, so the phrase in the resolution, "Therefore, the various obligations stipulated by the Covenant must be implemented," could not be accepted by the country. Subsequently, the Abyssinian representative, Walter, spoke, stating that Italy was waging a war of aggression and that its methods of warfare violated international law, but the Executive Council's resolution did not mention this, which was regrettable. Furthermore, the Covenant of the League of Nations contains clear provisions for member states to provide assistance to countries that have been invaded, but the Executive Council has failed to maintain its commitment to these provisions, which sets a bad precedent with endless consequences. After the speech, the Chairman, the Australian representative Bruce, announced the adjournment of the meeting, which was at 10:20 PM, only ten minutes after the public meeting began.

<p>(Geneva) The Executive Council of the League of Nations held a public meeting at 3:00 PM today.</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Eden spoke first, stating the responsibility of each member state regarding collective security. His words were straightforward and received close attention from the audience. Eden stated that seven months ago, the League of Nations had decided that Italy's commencement of war violated the Covenant of the League of Nations. The governments of all countries must express their obligations during these critical times and clearly announce the policies they intend to adopt. The United Kingdom is prepared to further implement economic and financial sanctions. The use of poisonous gas in war has long been deemed illegal by Italy, Abyssinia, and eleven other countries, and is related to the residents of major cities around the world. It now appears to have been used to harm people who are completely unprepared for this type of poisonous gas. How can we stand idly by and remain silent? Can we be confident that our own people will not suffer the pain of being burned, blinded, or killed in the future? In general, the future effectiveness of the League of Nations for all the countries attending the Executive Council that may need the protection of the Covenant of the League of Nations will largely depend on the final outcome of the current issue. The United Kingdom is prepared to act in accordance with the policies of the League of Nations, and its progress will be the same as other countries, but no greater than other countries. If the League of Nations is fundamentally shaken and its future effectiveness is uncertain, then we can only consider the policies that we are responsible for adopting. Eden finally appealed to the member states to do their best to jointly uphold the authority of the League of Nations. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>French Minister Without Portfolio Pang Gu spoke next, saying, "We must now address the threat in Europe, so we must restore peace in Africa. To complete the construction of Europe, we must have the full cooperation of Italy. The situation of Italy should also be resolved. The Italian representative Aloisi said this morning that Italy has never intended to deviate from the Covenant of the League of Nations. This statement is gratifying." Pang Gu further explained that the situation in Europe has become complicated due to the violation of current treaties by a certain country and that ways should be found to remedy this.</p>
<p>Soviet representative Bodankin, who is also the Ambassador to France, spoke after Pang Gu, saying that the reason why the reconciliation efforts of the Committee of Thirteen ultimately failed was due to the League of Nations' weak attitude towards the aggressor. The more arrogant and stubborn the aggressor's attitude, the more lenient the treatment it received, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>Polish representative Komarnicki said that if the League of Nations makes another attempt to reconcile the Italy-Abyssinia dispute, Poland is ready to participate.</p>
<p>Argentine representative Granchi expressed hesitation about tightening sanctions against Italy and stated that regarding the Locarno Pact, he hoped that the signatories of the Locarno Treaty would maintain close contact.</p>
<p>Portuguese representative Vasconcelos, Danish representative Baudebierre, Romanian representative Antoniade, Turkish representative Suat, Chilean representative Ordini, and Ecuadorean representative Chaldernik spoke in succession, all expressing regret over the failure of the reconciliation efforts.</p>
<p>Spanish representative Madariaga (Chairman of the Committee of Thirteen) said that in his opinion, the implementation of Article 11 of the Covenant of the League of Nations should precede Article 16 (regarding sanctions), and that the general international situation is such that the responsibilities of the League of Nations will inevitably become more difficult. He hoped that Italy would show goodwill so that the reconciliation efforts might succeed. (Above, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>At this point, the Chairman of the Executive Council, Australian representative Bruce, said that 52 countries have agreed to apply pressure within their capabilities to stop the aggression. This pressure must continue. If it is abandoned, then the entire principle of collective action and the regulations of human affairs will suffer a fatal blow. Member states must not take any action to undermine the collective action efforts represented by the League of Nations. Therefore, it is now necessary to re-examine the entire system of collective security in light of the events of the past seven months and seek the best way to improve the situation. As for the use of poisonous gas, it is an insidious and cruel form of warfare. (Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Italian representative Aloisi then stood up to respond to this issue, saying that all countries only know how to criticize Italy, but no one pays attention to the atrocities committed by the Abyssinian army that Italy has exposed. At this point, Abyssinian representative Walter declared that he would respond to what Aloisi had said. At this point, the Executive Council announced the adjournment of the meeting.</p>
<p>According to Article 11 of the Covenant, it is stated: It is hereby declared that any war or threat of war, whether it directly or indirectly involves any Member of the League, is a matter of concern to the entire League, and the League shall endeavor to prevent it in order to maintain peace among nations. At the request of any Member of the League, the Secretary-General shall immediately convene the Executive Council. It is also declared that any situation affecting international relations that is sufficient to disturb international peace or endanger the good understanding on which international peace depends, any Member of the League has the right, in the name of friendship, to bring to the attention of the Assembly or the Executive Council.

<p>(Geneva) Vasconcelos, Chairman of the League of Nations Assembly's Eighteenth Nation Committee, recently sent letters to the representatives of the member states, stating that convening the committee at this time would be inappropriate. The date for the meeting will be selected later, after the Ninetieth Ordinary Session of the Administrative Council convenes on May 11th. However, should any major incident occur in the interim, the committee will be convened promptly. Appended to the end of the letter were import and export trade figures for Italy before and after the implementation of sanctions. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Extraordinary Session of the League of Nations Administrative Council has concluded, and it has been decided to convene a committee of experts on sanctions to review the implementation of existing sanctions measures, in order to provide some satisfaction to public opinion. The Ninetieth Ordinary Session of the Administrative Council is scheduled to convene on May 11th. According to speculation by members of the British delegation, the Administrative Council will definitely discuss tightening sanctions against Italy during the ordinary session. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Secretariat of the League of Nations recently issued a brief communiqué stating that the committee of experts on sanctions convened this morning. The chairman, Swedish representative Westman, was followed by the chairman of the Sanctions Adjustment Committee, Portuguese representative Vasconcelos, who stated that the sanctions measures decided by the Adjustment Committee had severely reduced Italy's import and export trade, and that the financial resources necessary for Italy to continue the war had been limited, demonstrating the great effectiveness of the sanctions. The committee of experts then discussed two issues: 1. The legal measures taken by member states in implementing sanctions, as reported recently. 2. The amount of import and export trade between member states and Italy and its territories, as reported at the request of the League of Nations. (Havas, 21st)</p>

<p>(Rome) Although Italian forces in East Africa have not yet captured Addis Ababa, Italians here celebrated the anniversary of the founding of Rome today. Two 8,000-ton cruisers were launched today to embellish the celebration. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini gave a speech to 100,000 people from the balcony of his residence, including the words, "We have gone through a difficult voyage and are now gradually approaching the port." The audience cheered upon hearing this. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Rome) Today marks the 2,690th anniversary of the founding of the city of Rome. Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a short but meaningful speech from the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia at 11:30 this morning, stating, "Today we celebrate our arduous work and victory. What we have done is like sailing; we have now weathered the waves and reached the shore. We bring with us the strength, justice, and civilization of Rome, and we can go anywhere and be successful." From dawn, flags were hung everywhere in the city. Although it was raining heavily, the city was brightly lit and decorated, creating a festive atmosphere. At 9:00 a.m., the Prime Minister, wearing the uniform of the Party Army Commander, went to the Central Hospital to preside over the opening ceremony of the malaria ward. Then, because the Via del Teatro di Marcello was about to be widened, he went there to perform the groundbreaking ceremony, personally pushing down a short wall of an old building. After the ceremony, he immediately returned to the Palazzo Venezia and personally distributed gratuity licenses to 100 elderly and disabled workers to show his concern. (Havas, 21st)</p>

<p>(Rome) Italian East African High Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force, General Badoglio, recently issued a communiqué stating, "The Italian army in the south has advanced 100 kilometers from its front-line base in the Wogaidan Province, pursuing the Abyssinian army. The headquarters of the Italian army in the north has been moved to the city of Taixi." (Havas, 21st) Mogadishu: The fierce battle of Goianacobo ended on April 17th, resulting in the defeat of the Abyssinian army. In this battle, one Abyssinian soldier fired a machine gun at the Italian army, and was unfortunately killed. Thereupon, his wife took his place and fired the machine gun for six hours until she was captured by Filipino soldiers in the Italian army. She is truly a heroine. The purpose of this major battle was to clear the road to Daga Modyu, which is the right end of the fortified line between Daga Fort and Daga Modyu built by the famous Turkish general Vehip Pasha during the European War, the "Hindenburg Line." General Graziani's troops are now attacking the "Hindenburg Line" along the road from Gabirarda Ri to Sassabana. (Reuters, 21st) Addis Ababa: Political circles here deny reports that the Italian army has advanced to within a day's journey of Addis Ababa. The whole city is now plastered with notices reassuring the people, stating that the Abyssinian government has been in communication with all towns rumored to have been occupied by the enemy, including Suramita (100 miles from Addis Ababa on the road to Taixi), Ankober, Hua Hsu, Daga Fort, Xiga, and Harar. The Abyssinian people are urged not to believe enemy propaganda. At the same time, residents of the capital are still evacuating in droves, with only the military and police remaining in the city. The Abyssinian people are now withdrawing their savings from the Bank of Abyssinia, sewing them into canvas bags for concealment. (Reuters, 21st) Addis Ababa: Thousands of wealthy Abyssinian and foreigners, hearing that the Italian army is about to advance to Addis Ababa, have moved elsewhere today. Most shops have closed, and almost all doors are closed. Only the Abyssinian Queen remains in the city, serving calmly as usual. All embassies are full of their own nationals. Large tents have been built on the airfields and large stoves have been set up to provide three meals a day. Thousands of Indians, Arabs, and other British nationals are lying in the gardens of the British Embassy, which has gradually become the last center of activity in Addis Ababa. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e57">British Armed Forces Budget: Totaling 790 Million Pounds; National Defense Expenditure Increases Sharply This Year; Chancellor of the Exchequer Explains to the House of Commons <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>(London) This year's budget, which is regarded as an armed forces budget, was submitted to the House of Commons today by Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain. The galleries were unusually crowded, including many diplomats and representatives from overseas autonomous territories. There was, of course, a large turnout of Members of Parliament. At 3:33 p.m., Chamberlain presented his fifth budget amidst cheers.</p>
<p>The Chancellor first stated that one notable fact was that the surplus of the previous term was 3 million pounds, 2.5 million pounds more than he had budgeted. He had estimated an additional budget of 14 million pounds, but in reality, he raised 14 million pounds. This indicates an extraordinary willingness to contribute to national income. So far, the country has been able to cope with unexpected new financial demands with ease. This is something the country can congratulate itself on. The increase in national wealth and the expansion of commerce can also be seen from this. The operation of the Exchange Equalisation Fund is still profitable. In the past fiscal year, the national debt has been reduced by £4,500,000, and the amount of floating debt has also been reduced by £51,500,000. The amount of debt repayment has not been increased, and the figure for debt clearance remains at £124,000,000.</p>
<p>At the beginning of his speech, the Chancellor distributed a financial report stating that the total budget for the army, navy, and air force was £537,000,000, compared to £512,000,000 last year.</p>
<p>The Chancellor stated that he had decided to allocate an additional £110,000,000 this year for additional national defense expenditure outside of the announced budget. It is estimated that the new national defense expenditure for 1936-7 will be £10,000,000 for the air force, while the new expenditure required for the army and navy has not yet been determined, but may also require £10,000,000. The total expenditure for 1936-7, including supplements, will be £798,000,000. Although national expenditure will increase greatly, the Chancellor expects national income to increase as well. He estimates that customs and excise duties will amount to £314,000,000, an increase of £10,500,000 over last year. He also estimates that income tax revenue will be £248,000,000, an increase of £10,000,000 over last year. Increased business expansion tax revenue should increase. In addition to the expected increase in income tax revenue of £10,000,000, beer tax revenue may increase by £.000.000, tobacco tax by £3,000,000, and oil tax by £3,000,000, estimating inland revenue at £420,000,00. Based on current tax rates, the total income from all sources should be £776,000,000, and the shortfall will be £21,000,000. The government will revise the law in the future to prevent tax evasion, and will pay attention to those who live in the country but manage their assets transferred abroad, as well as so-called one-man companies. It is expected that this measure will increase income by 4 million pounds in one year. Attention should also be paid to so-called educational custody funds, as they are used to evade taxes. Assets given by parents to their children have always been tax-free, but the tax-free method is now being abolished, which will generate £2,500,000. He intends to make up the shortfall from this year's income.</p>
<p>Referring to the difficulty of military expenditure, the Chancellor said that it would not be fair if the entire cost of re-equipping the military were to be recovered from national donations over the next five years. If a disarmament agreement cannot be reached, national defense expenditure will soon reach its peak. In the future, part of this expenditure may rely on loans. The Chancellor announced that income tax will increase by three pence per pound and tea tax by two pence per pound. He also intends to withdraw £5,250,000 from the road reserve fund, so that the budget surplus can reach £500,000. The only benefit that taxpayers will receive is that the children's allowance will be increased from £50 to £60, and the married allowance will be increased from £170 to £180. In the budget, the plan to help disaster areas is to organize a company with a fixed capital of £1,000. 000 to provide financial assistance to small businesses. The Chancellor stated that the final estimate was revenue of £798,381,000 and expenditure of £797,897,000, resulting in a surplus of £484,000. The Chancellor's report on the financial budget lasted for one hour and twenty-seven minutes. He finished speaking and sat down at 5:00 p.m. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<p>(London) Secretary of State for War Cooper spoke to the Territorial Army in Munchster last night, saying that the situation in Europe today is more serious than in 1914. The stakes are higher, so the losses will be greater. The only real progress we have made since the European War has been the manufacture of more destructive weapons. This is nothing short of the suicide of civilization. The suicide of civilization may be seen in our time. Without the Territorial Army, I don't know how we would be able to defend Britain on a voluntary basis.

The gifts received by Chancellor Hitler were of all shapes and sizes, and there were many that were unique and had deep meaning, such as the donation of 30,000 pairs of socks for use by the troops. The Berlin National Socialist Women's Association donated twelve cradles for use by babies born today. The Women's Civil Servants Association donated one thousand cradles for use by poor families. In addition, there were donations of food, paintings, sculptures, and books. (Havas, 20th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) In view of the tense international situation, the Japanese government has decided that, after the regular cabinet meeting every Friday, an informal three-minister conference of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs will be held. (The Prime Minister will also participate when necessary.) The first meeting is scheduled to be held on the 24th of this month. The discussion will cover the general situation of national defense and diplomacy, and a free and candid discussion will be held from a broad perspective, agreeing on the fundamental policies that Japan should adopt. At the same time, opinions will be exchanged on the international situation in order to determine and adjust the general outline of concrete countermeasures for foreign relations under satisfactory coordination. The main agenda for the conference is roughly as follows: 1. Establishing the coordination and unification of diplomacy and national defense. 2. What practical methods should be adopted in accordance with the independent and proactive national policy of diplomacy? 3. What policies should be implemented to eliminate the Red Movement in East Asia? 4. Adjusting diplomatic relations between Japan, Manchuria, China, and the Soviet Union. 5. Fundamentally handling relations with Britain and the United States. (Domei News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan's implementation of its continental policy is related to the fulfillment of the important mission of national defense by the army. The central military authorities, in response to the independent and proactive policy of the current cabinet, are devoting all their efforts to its realization. They are paying very close attention to the recent new situations in which the Soviet Union, Outer Mongolia, and China have unfolded. Comprehensively considering the current situation, observing future Sino-Japanese relations, it is recognized that there is no immediate way to adjust Sino-Japanese relations based on Japan's three principles for China, and to improve all Sino-Japanese relations. Therefore, the military authorities attach great importance to the current situation in the Far East. In order to implement the continental policy, it is necessary to first seek the fulfillment of national defense, so this point must require the serious attention of the people. Minister of the Army Terauchi said that the Prime Minister's speech in the Diet should reflect the general intention of the military, and will exchange opinions candidly with the cabinet members. After the Diet ends, Minister of the Army Terauchi's plan to fulfill national defense will gradually become concrete. Regarding budgetary relations, etc., officials are currently conducting concrete research. (Den Tsushin, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Kokumin Shimbun published an article today, stating that Prime Minister Hirota is now planning to clear all obstacles in the path of Japan's continental policy. Hirota has consulted with Minister of the Army Terada several times and reached a complete compromise. The military is now studying the following policies: 1. Closer cooperation between the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs Ministries. 2. Abandoning the "inertia" plan regarding the border dispute in "Manchukuo" and formulating a fundamental and permanent countermeasure policy. The military does not feel that the frequent changes in the Chinese government's policy toward Japan have caused Japan much suffering. Therefore, the military is now considering permanent policies, and the relationship between the Chinese government and the Kuomintang should be handled accordingly. The military believes that the intrusion of the Communist Party into Shanxi Province affects the administration of eastern Hebei and Chahar, and in turn harms the interests of "Manchukuo." Therefore, the Chinese government should be advised to quell the communist rebellion. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e61">Japanese Government Considers Reforming Administrative Agencies; Baba to Be Appointed Vice Prime Minister <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government is now considering a plan to reform national administrative agencies. Finance Minister Baba may be appointed as Vice Prime Minister, but as a minister without portfolio. This step will be taken after the end of the special Diet session. Japanese Prime Minister Hirota recently said that he would cancel one or two administrative departments and merge them, and appoint several ministers without portfolio separately. Prime Minister Hirota and influential figures in the cabinet all believe that administrative reform must be implemented at the same time as the appointment of ministers without portfolio, so that the political system can be completely reformed. There are two methods for appointing ministers without portfolio, both of which are currently under consideration: 1. Appointing four or five people to assist the current ministers. Their responsibility is to plan important national policies. 2. Appointing a Vice Prime Minister. Prime Minister Hirota does not want to recruit figures from political parties as newly appointed cabinet members, so it seems that the second method will be adopted in the future. Finance Minister Baba, one of the important figures in the Hirota cabinet, seems likely to be appointed as Vice Prime Minister and Director of the Cabinet Investigation Bureau, an agency that investigates national policies. Minister of Commerce and Industry Ogawa is expected to succeed as Finance Minister. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) For the pivotal position in Japanese diplomacy, the ambassador to China, Kawatatsu, has already been transferred as Consul-General in Tianjin, thus resolving the previous intention to appoint former Vice-Minister Shigemitsu. However, recently, there has been talk that Ambassador to the Soviet Union Ota is willing to retire, and there have been suggestions to appoint former Vice-Minister Shigemitsu to succeed him. It is said that Ambassador Ota will take the opportunity of the expiration of the Soviet Fisheries Agreement on the 27th of next month to submit his resignation. At a time when Japanese-Soviet relations are becoming more important, it is questionable whether his wish will be realized. If it is realized, the promotion of Togo, Director of the Eurasian Bureau, is also quite likely. The transfer of Sato, Ambassador to France, and the appointment of former Vice-Minister Shigemitsu are also under consideration. However, Ambassador Sato to France is currently difficult to leave France. Prime Minister Hirota greatly hopes that former Vice-Minister Shigemitsu will return to the front line of diplomacy. If former Vice-Minister Shigemitsu agrees, there is a strong possibility that he will be appointed as Ambassador to the Soviet Union. (Den Tsushin, 21st)</p>

<p>(London) When the Locarno Treaty signatory countries held their second meeting in Geneva on the 10th of this month, the British and French representatives immediately agreed to base their demands on the French memorandum of April 8th, asking Germany to clarify the four points contained in its memorandum of March 31st. The four points are: 1. How can the mutual non-aggression pact proposed by Germany be integrated with the basic principles of the League of Nations, namely the principle of collective security? 2. What is the intention of separating the League of Nations Charter from the Treaty of Versailles and making it an independent chapter? 3. What is the content of the equal rights demanded by Germany on the colonial issue? 4. Regarding the current situation in Austria, the Free City of Danzig, and the Memel Autonomous Region, are there any immediate demands for changes to the current European borders? According to our reporter, British officials, unwilling to act hastily, will generally wait for the end of the French legislative elections, i.e., after May 3, before raising this issue with Germany. The wording will be as precise as possible, so that Germany can clearly explain its views on the European and colonial issues without any ambiguity. At that time, a memorandum will be attached, making various suggestions to reconcile the plans put forward by France and Germany, so that the mutual non-aggression pact proposed by Germany can be integrated with the French claims, one to implement the various principles of the League of Nations Charter, and the other to establish a mutual assistance system. Informed sources also said that Germany originally intended to demand that the signatory countries of the mutual non-aggression pact should remain neutral if Germany took action against non-signatory countries. The main goal of Britain is to dispel this demand. According to British opinion, the mutual non-aggression pact proposed by Germany, compared with the obligations stipulated by the League of Nations Covenant, should naturally take second place.

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt delivered a speech to the annual meeting of the Daughters of the American Revolution today, stating that the government is determined to strengthen national defense while not forgetting the Good Neighbor Policy, and that there is no contradiction between the two goals. The current national defense strength is much stronger than before, and this is intentional. Aggressive war is definitely not the policy of the United States and is not included in the plans of the US Army and Navy. Our goal is to adapt to the needs of national defense, and we seek nothing else. The needs of national defense vary with changes in the international situation. If all countries can disarm, then the United States' need for national defense will also decrease accordingly. Unfortunately, the current world is not like that. However, our disarmament policy is clear: first, we propose to continue seeking international agreements to limit armaments. Even if this effort fails, we do not want to increase armaments, unless the expansion of armaments by other countries endangers our security, then we should consider other options.

<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced today that talks with the Chinese banking delegation led by Chen Guangfu may last for another two weeks. However, I do not believe this indicates an obstacle to the current talks, and he stated that the scope of the talks is wider than expected, so we intend to proceed deliberately. Regarding the rise in silver prices in the New York market, the Treasury Secretary stated that the silver prices held by the Treasury Department have not changed, so the reason for the rise must be that the business community believes that silver prices are higher than before. As for the rumors that the rise in silver prices is due to the Chinese currency being linked to the US dollar, Morgenthau declined to discuss it. Experts generally believe that this is the result of speculator activity, and that the markets in India and China are also more active. According to reports from here, India recently stopped purchasing silver and is now suddenly re-importing it, possibly due to increased imports. During the spring of this year, the volume of Indian imports exceeded seven times that of the same period last year, and nearly half of the highest record in 1930. At the same time, it is known that a small amount of silver is currently being shipped from London to China. Observers familiar with the situation believe that this is quite strange, but some also believe that individual merchants hope to sell it to the Chinese government, and the Chinese government will then sell it to the US to make a profit. Other observers believe that this silver is shipped to China and then transshipped to the United States. Currently, Sino-American talks are still strictly confidential, but there is a growing feeling here that the United States may agree to purchase Chinese silver to alleviate the pain that China claims to have suffered from the US silver purchase policy. As for the price issue, it is not believed here that the US price can be excessively higher than the world price, because the Treasury Department must also prevent political attacks at home. It is said that after the Sino-American talks are over, Chen Guangfu will go to New York to assist in establishing a New York branch of the Bank of China. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Washington) US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, when discussing the silver situation today, said that although silver prices in New York and London have risen, the silver purchase price of the Treasury Department remains at 45 cents per ounce. Morgenthau declined to comment on the recent activity in the silver market, or whether he would rather see the Chinese currency linked to the US dollar rather than to the British pound and the US dollar as it is today. Morgenthau replied that he did not wish to comment on this issue, and also stated that he and the Chinese financial experts visiting the United States will continue negotiations for about a week.

This morning, when the ship arrived here, a representative from the Japanese consulate boarded the ship to escort the rescued men ashore and thank Captain Bruce and others for their rescue efforts. According to Mr. Bruce, the plane flew from Japan to Qingdao, and then flew out of Qingdao, destination unknown. In the afternoon, it flew over the Hunan and appeared to have lost its way. Around 5:00 p.m., the crew of the ship saw the plane again, hovering around the ship before landing nearby. The chief mate of the Hunan boarded a small boat that had been unloaded and rescued the two men onto the ship. Neither of them could speak English, but it was known that they were forced to land due to a lack of fuel. The Hunan was preparing to tow the plane to the side of the ship and lift it onto the deck, but unexpectedly, the Japanese aviators suddenly fired incendiary bullets at the plane, and the plane immediately caught fire and was destroyed in a matter of minutes.

<h3 id="e85">A Certain Foreign Ronin Assaults European Police Officer in Shantou; Police Officer Seriously Injured; Two Ronin Arrested; Foreign Consulate Requests Jurisdiction from Municipal Government <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The actions of foreign ronin in Chaozhou and Shantou have become increasingly arrogant recently. Smuggling and tax evasion have long become commonplace. Harassment of Europeans is also frequently seen. After a certain foreign cruiser arrived in Shantou a few days ago, the ronin, relying on its power, again engaged in an outrageous incident of assaulting a European police officer. It is said that a certain foreign ronin smuggling syndicate has been severely punished by the anti-smuggling authorities for smuggling rice, resulting in sluggish sales of smuggled goods. Recently, in addition to trying to expand sales in the interior, the ronin have also enticed traitors in Shantou, granting them the ostensible title of "Distribution Office of a Certain Foreign Firm" to facilitate the expansion of their business. They instructed them to set up shops and sell smuggled rice, exempting them from paying business taxes and not requiring them to obtain business licenses or pay any other donations or taxes. A general group of unemployed hooligans, blinded by profit, competed to obtain wooden signs from the syndicate bearing the name of a certain foreign firm for their business. In the past month, the establishment of such distribution stores has sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain. According to investigations, there are no less than a hundred stores in the city. Because rice prices have risen in recent months, the price of smuggled rice per bag is one yuan or several dimes cheaper than taxed rice. The psychology of the masses in the impoverished society is to be greedy for convenience, so those who flock to it are like ducks. Inspectors and anti-smuggling officers, in order to maintain government revenue, earnestly advised citizens not to purchase smuggled rice. If they repeatedly refused to listen, they would have to stop them. As a result, they were envied by the ronin, who regarded the police as enemies and always thought of harassing and insulting them. Around 3:00 p.m. on the 14th, police officer Ou Han of the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau was on duty at the 15th section when five or six foreign ronin approached him and deliberately kicked him. Ou did not argue with them. Seeing that their plan did not succeed, the ronin walked along Tongping Road. At the intersection of Tongping Road, they deliberately stood in the middle of the road, obstructing traffic, and talked and laughed loudly. Police officer Zhu Rili of the section, believing that they violated police regulations, stepped forward to persuade them politely. The ronin did not listen and instead insulted Zhu, then even pushed Zhu to the ground and surrounded him, violently beating him. At that time, a special police officer for defense funding happened to be passing by and stepped forward to dissuade them, but the ronin ignored him. Later, a police team from the Third Branch came to relieve the shift and, seeing their colleague being beaten, were filled with righteous indignation and rushed forward to stop them. Only then did the ronin flee in panic, but two of them were captured by the police team and taken back to the branch for interrogation. It is said that one, surnamed Lin, and another, surnamed Huang, are citizens of a certain foreign country and work at a certain foreign firm at the end of Shanpai Street. They only admitted that a misunderstanding had occurred with the police due to language barriers and that they did not assault the police officer. The branch believed that Lin, Huang, and others assaulting the police officer was witnessed by many people, so how could it be allowed to be excused with sophistry? The injured police officer, Zhu Rili, was sent to the Gospel Hospital run by the British for an examination. After the hospital doctor examined Zhu, he found that Zhu had multiple injuries to his face and body, and he filled out an injury report. He sent Zhu back to the branch. At this point, Feng Gang, the head of the Third Branch, did not dare to act arbitrarily regarding how to handle Lin, Huang, and others assaulting the police officer. He telegraphed Song Dejian, the head of the Public Security Bureau, for instructions. Song instructed to transfer the case to the bureau for handling. After receiving the instruction, Feng handed Lin Yingjie and the others over to the Public Security Bureau along with the confession and injury report. The bureau, believing that foreign ronin did not abide by the police laws of their residence, and even assaulted the police, disregarded our government, and insulted our civil servants, felt that if this was not seriously negotiated, it would greatly hinder the police from performing their duties in the future. In addition to detaining Lin and Huang, the case was reported to the municipal government. After receiving the report, the municipal government, in addition to first contacting a certain foreign consulate by telephone, formally submitted a note to the foreign consulate on the afternoon of the 15th. It is heard that the foreign consulate has requested that the municipal government first send Lin and Huang back to the consulate for their own handling. (April 17)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Mid-Term Situation in the Suppression of Bandits; Brief Overview of Shanxi's Financial Situation; Military Expenditures Surge; Bandit Areas Spread, Revenues Sharply Decline <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Shanxi's finances have long been in a state of exhaustion, due to the devastation caused by the provincial currency in 1919, and the vitality has not yet recovered. With the bankruptcy of rural areas and the stagnation of finance in recent years, both public and private finances have been very strained even before the Communist bandits disturbed Shanxi. The provincial treasury's income and expenditure were in deficit by more than 700,000 yuan per month. The arrears transferred throughout the last year were nearly 10 million yuan. While the authorities were trying to make up for it, the Communist bandits disturbed Shanxi, military affairs suddenly arose, and income sharply decreased. Its financial difficulties, from a global perspective, occupy the same important component as military affairs. Since the Communist bandits sneaked into Shanxi from northern Shaanxi, initially only occupying Zhongyang and Shilou, most of them were ravaged by bandit troops. Although the degree of damage varied, the scene of people supporting the old and young and fleeing in groups was the same. Up until recently, it has reached thirty or forty counties. In these areas, people have no time to pay public funds, let alone save their lives. Therefore, the province's income has completely come to a standstill. Moreover, Shanxi, a rich area in the province, is known as southern Shanxi. The province's tax revenue has always been rooted in the Hedong Road. This time, the bandit troops focused their attention on this area. The counties disturbed were mostly in southern Shanxi, so the sharp decline in the province's tax revenue can be imagined. As for the huge expenditures after the military mobilization, it is even more difficult to predict. In order to encourage morale, Yan issued a clear order from the day of the attack that each soldier would receive an additional four yuan and fifty cents per month on top of his original salary. Including other items, it is said that an additional 1 million yuan must be spent each month. If we add the previous deficit of 700,000 yuan per month, it would be useless to raise another 2 million yuan per month on top of the original income. The authorities are extremely anxious about this. In addition to repeatedly appealing to the central government for assistance, they have also repeatedly convened financial meetings to discuss ways to raise funds to make up for the deficit. Currently, in addition to the central government agreeing to provide monthly assistance of 500,000 yuan (some say 300,000 yuan), the province's fundraising methods have been either clearly ordered to be implemented or are being planned, including the following: In the entire province, except for the three counties of Zhongyang, Shilou, and Xi County, which were most severely affected by the bandit disaster, an additional tax of one yuan per tael will be levied. For all houses, if they are not self-occupied and are rented out, one-tenth of the rent income will be collected per month. Business stall taxes are determined differently depending on the situation in Taiyuan City. Donations will be deducted from the salaries of civil servants. Those who actually receive more than 600 yuan per month will have 70% deducted, those who receive more than 500 yuan will have 60% deducted, those who receive more than 400 yuan will have 50% deducted, those who receive more than 300 yuan will have 40% deducted, those who receive more than 200 yuan will have 30% deducted, and those who receive more than 100 yuan will have 20% deducted. Even those who receive as little as 20 yuan will have a deduction rate. Those who receive less can donate freely. All civil servants who receive public funds from the province or county will be subject to the above regulations and will be deducted by the disbursing agency. However, the deduction rate for the education sector is slightly lighter than for other sectors. The banquet donation is organized by the municipal government. It is stipulated that those with a菜价菜价 above 5 yuan will be charged one-tenth of the tax, and those with 菜价菜价 below 5 yuan will be exempt from the tax. The above measures have been clearly ordered to be implemented. In addition, there are anti-communist donations, but the amount is very small. It is currently planned to levy additional donations on luxury goods, etc., similar to the anti-bandit military vehicle period in Jiangxi Province. The implementation method is being researched, and it is heard that personnel have been sent to Jiangxi for on-site investigation, and it should be implemented soon. Among the above measures, the land tax surcharge and the deduction from civil servants' salaries are the largest amounts. However, with the spread of military affairs and the expansion of bandit areas, the original income has decreased invisibly. It is truly difficult to estimate whether the newly raised funds can replenish the loss of the bandit areas. Therefore, the authorities are still extremely worried about this financial problem.

<h3 id="e87">Remnants of Liu Guitang's Bandits Defeated in Linyi; Mao and Zhang, Major Bandits, Intercepted in Bengbu; Escorted to Jinan for Execution <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: More than a hundred bandits including Mao Xuehai and Zhang Jincai, who were wreaking havoc in Linyi, Shandong Province, were originally remnants of Liu Guitang's bandits. A few days ago, Han Duoxi sent Liu Yaoting, the captain of the special reconnaissance team of the Second Route Headquarters, to lead the team to suppress them. They engaged the bandits in the Shangfang Village area of Linyi and killed five bandits on the spot, burned six to death, and captured eight prisoners including Guo Wenyan, all of whom were executed in Zaozhuang. The remaining bandits were all defeated. The two major bandits, Mao and Zhang, fled south along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and arrived in Bengbu a few days ago, hiding in the home of Zhang Hanbin, a native of Yi County, Hebei, in Xujiagangzi. Liu Yaoting, based on a secret report, immediately led eight team members, including the team leader, to track them down. At 4:00 p.m. on the 19th, Mao, Zhang, and the mastermind Zhang Hanbin were captured in Xugang. It was found that bandit Mao was 40 years old and bandit Zhang was 34 years old, both from Maojiabu, Linyi. They had been rampant in the border area between Jiangsu and Shandong for many years with Liu Guitang. They had been repeatedly suppressed and arrested, but they had always escaped the net. They had been wanted by the Shandong Provincial Government. Their arrest in Bengbu this time is truly a great benefit to Shandong Province. This morning (the 20th), Liu Yaoting led his troops to escort the three criminals onto the Ping-Hu train to Jinan for execution. (20th)</p>
<h3 id="e88">Guangdong Province Actively Promotes Agricultural and Forestry Movement: Gaoyao County Opens New Lingyang Gorge Forest Farm, Heshan County Opens Civilian Reclamation Area, Chaoyang County Can Complete Two Forest Farms This Year <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: In recent years, Guangdong Province has paid extreme attention to the agricultural and forestry movement. Afforestation and reclamation work in various counties are unusually active. Recently, Ma Bingqian, the head of Gaoyao County, believed that although the various trees planted in the Zhaoqing Gui Ding Mountain Forest Farm were properly planted, the roadsides on both sides still needed to be planted to provide shade for tourists. Yesterday, a special commissioner was sent to the site to plant various trees to enhance the scenery. Also, considering that the area north of Lingyang Gorge is vast, covering hundreds of acres, and can be developed into a forest farm, technicians were sent to survey and draft plans and project proposals. Construction has now begun, and a large number of seedlings, such as tung oil and eucalyptus, have been purchased, hoping to take advantage of the spring rains when plants grow easily. More than one hundred workers have been hired to speed up the work. The Heshan County Government, to help unemployed and impoverished people, has designated Longyan Cave in the Sixth District as the first county-run civilian reclamation area, which has now been opened. It is estimated to accommodate more than 10,000 people. The county government has issued orders to district offices, instructing township heads to clearly investigate the food situation of unemployed impoverished people, list them, and submit reports in order to relocate them to the reclamation area in batches. Furthermore, since the establishment of the Chaoyang County Agricultural and Forestry Promotion Office, it has extensively planted trees. Therefore, the previously barren mountains and desolate lands are now lush with trees and a sight to behold. It has been found that the forest farms that have already been developed include the Xishan County-run Zhongshan Memorial Forest Farm and the Dongyan County-run First Forest Farm. The First Forest Farm is divided into seven forest classes. The second, fourth, fifth, and sixth forest classes were completed last year, and it has been decided that the first, third, and seventh forest classes will also be completed this year. As for the Xishan Forest Farm, which was originally divided into two forest classes, although it was completed last year, the trees in the farm were severely damaged by major and minor typhoons, so replanting will be carried out this year to ensure concealment. In addition, 2,500 acacia trees have been planted along the Huan Cheng Road. In the next few days, 5,000 willow trees will be planted along the river from Shuimen to Houxi Wharf.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Guangdong Province Actively Purchases Silver from Various Affiliated Areas: Special Commissioners Sent to Various Counties to Be Responsible for Absorption; Silver Purchasing Supervisory Office Established <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Since the implementation of legal tender in Guangdong Province, the province has been engaged in absorbing silver with legal tender. Recently, the original Japanese fractional coins have disappeared in Guangzhou City. However, various counties are still using paper money (i.e., silver fractional notes of the Provincial and Municipal Banks) to purchase silver as much as possible. The purchasing office is purchasing silver from various villages, and the provincial headquarters has issued orders to various counties and cities, instructing their subordinates to prohibit the direct use of silver. Meanwhile, the Finance Department has telegraphed various counties, sending instructions to county governments, tax revenue agencies, silver purchasing commissioners, tax revenue inspectors, and sub-treasury chiefs, stating roughly that the Provincial Bank has sent staff carrying legal tender to the county to set up offices to purchase silver. It should be announced that from the date of the announcement, all tax revenues and all income from contractors, no matter how much, even less than one yuan, must not accept silver. Violators will be arrested by people's organizations, military and political agencies, and sent to the special court, to be convicted of corruption. The use of silver is also prohibited in market trading and all personnel transactions. Violators on both sides will be punished severely for disrupting financial order. If the delivering party delivers silver, the receiving party should immediately report it and will be rewarded with 80% of the silver delivered. The receiving party should instruct the delivering party to exchange the silver for legal tender at the purchasing office, and the receiving party will still collect the payment from the delivering party separately. The county inspectors should inspect the aforementioned prohibitions at any time. In case of an offender caught in the act, they may immediately arrest and send them to the police. Those who are aware of but fail to report should be punished as accomplices. The Public Security Bureau and district and township offices under the jurisdiction of the county government are responsible for inspection, arrest, and reporting. In addition to submitting separate reports and telegraphing, it is urgent to obey and implement the instructions. The county government immediately recorded the telegraph and announced it on the day of receiving the telegram, and instructed its subordinates to comply with it. It has been found that the most provincial bank purchased about 60 million yuan of silver. Currently, the silver purchased by various staff members in various counties and cities is about 10 million yuan, accounting for about six-tenths of the total silver in the province. The silver received will be stored in silver warehouses built by the Provincial Bank. The number will be transferred to the Legal Tender Issuance Preparatory Management Committee for safekeeping. The Legal Tender Management Committee held a meeting on the 16th to discuss the methods and dates for receiving silver. The candidates for the members of the expert committee and the staff and advisors of the committee have been largely determined. In addition, the Provincial Bank recently established a Silver Purchasing Supervisory Office in conjunction with the Finance Department, which is jointly organized by five members sent by the Finance Department and one member from the Provincial Bank. The responsibilities of the office are to design and supervise the progress of silver purchasing (April 17).</p>
<h3 id="e90">Tang Dynasty Tomb Discovered in Quanzhou: Tomb Bricks Have the Words "Zhenguan Three Years"; Four Tombs Excavated, Yielding Many Ancient Artifacts <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Communication: During the recent expansion of the Zhongshan Park public sports field in Quanzhou City, many ancient tombs were discovered during excavation. It has been confirmed that these are tombs from the Tang Dynasty, but there are no coffins inside, only tomb chambers. When they were discovered, the Jinjiang County Government believed that they had archaeological value and sent a letter to Xiamen University, and the university sent professors Lin Huixiang, Zheng Dekun, and Zhuang Weiji from the School of Arts to supervise the excavation. Initially, a coffin-less tomb was excavated, shaped like a cross. The walls of the tomb were built with ancient bricks engraved with patterns, and the top was like a circular dome with three recessed corners. The tomb pit was 15 feet long, 12 feet 1 inch wide at the shoulder, and 4 feet 10 inches wide at the other end. The bricks were about a foot long, five or six inches wide, and three inches thick. The edges were engraved with patterns of dragons, grass, double fish, turtles, snakes, ancient coins, and six-holed flowers. On the 16th, another tomb was excavated nearby, 4 feet 8 inches deep, and everything was the same as before, but the brick patterns were slightly different. There were words "Suici Yichou" on it. Inside the tomb, there were a broken bottle (amphora-shaped), as well as a bowl-shaped, chamber pot-shaped, candlestick-shaped, lid-shaped, shoe-shaped, and magnetic bottle, one of each, three broken coins, one five-turtle coin, and one large iron nail. On the 17th, two more tombs were excavated, making a total of four. The orientation of all the tombs was northeast to southwest at a 10-degree angle. The first tomb, counting from the east, was only half-excavated because it was quite laborious and was temporarily covered with earth. The second tomb was the one excavated on the 16th. The third tomb was excavated on the 17th and contained ancient bricks, one of which had the four characters "Suici Guiyou". A small round wooden charcoal was also found, and whether it was the charcoal left over from a coffin remains to be studied. The fourth tomb was also excavated on the 17th, and a broken ancient brick was found, with the four characters "Zhenguan Three Years" on it. Connecting it with the "Suici Yichou" character bricks excavated from the second tomb, it can be confirmed that these four tombs are all Tang Dynasty artifacts. Another brick had the words "Intercalary December Fourth," and the following characters were blurred. Inside the fourth tomb, a magnetic plate, five small teacups on the plate (already broken), a magnetic lamp base, and many pieces of broken magnetic bowls were also found. The distance between the first and second tombs is 116 inches, the distance between the second and third tombs is 119 inches, and the distance between the third and fourth tombs is the same. According to Zhuang Weiji, "There are more than ten similar ancient tombs in this area of Zhongshan Park. Four tombs have been excavated, and the unearthed items are now on display for public viewing. When more are excavated in the future, some of the unearthed artifacts will be taken to Xiamen University for research." On the 18th, the first tomb was continued to be excavated. From morning to night, only a quarter was excavated, and a complete round arch door and bones have been discovered. The third tomb was also continued to be excavated, yielding more than 40 kinds of Ming artifacts, including a stove with two pots attached, a , a chamber pot, a spoon, and large and small magnetic bottles. According to Lin Huixiang, it is planned to only excavate these four tombs and not to excavate others, because the unearthed artifacts are sufficient for research (April 19).</p>
<h3 id="e91">Jiangsu Province Anti-Smoking Conference Concludes: Support for Chairman Chiang's Elimination of Opium Addiction <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Communication: The Jiangsu Provincial Anti-Smoking Conference continued to hold two or three general meetings on the 21st, chaired in rotation by the three standing committee members of the Provincial Anti-Smoking Association, Leng Yuqiu, Zhou Houjun, and Gu Ziyang. At the morning meeting, the appointed review committee divided all the proposals into four groups for review. In the afternoon, the proposals were discussed one by one based on the review opinions, and the closing ceremony was held. The meeting did not end until 6:00 PM. Provincial Chairman Chen and the provincial party department hosted banquets for the committee members of various counties in the evening. The general meeting resolved the proposals, and the opinions were summarized into the following categories, which are described as follows:</p>
<p>Shorten the Time Limit for Prohibition: Jiangsu Province's anti-smoking limit is four years, starting in May of the 23rd year. Two years have passed. This general meeting decided that if the prohibition in various counties does not require four years in practice, they may request approval from higher authorities to shorten the time limit for prohibition.</p>
<p>Improve the Adjudication of Opium Cases: Regarding the adjudication of opium cases, the counties proposed many opinions for improvement, all advocating that except for special cases, the cases should be tried as soon as they arrive and be completed within a prescribed time limit to avoid backlog. This case is important and will be specially requested by the Provincial Anti-Smoking Association to the provincial government for review and implementation.</p>
<p>Dredge Out Inmates Imprisoned for Opium Offenses: Inmates imprisoned for opium offenses in various county prisons received special support. In addition to the bail measures already stipulated by the provincial government, the general meeting believes that inmates imprisoned for opium should be separated from ordinary inmates and given opportunities to learn skills so that they will not be unemployed after being released from prison. It also advocates for the establishment of more opium addicts factories. Each administrative region should have at least one such facility, implementing military management.</p>
<p>Increase Anti-Smoking Funding: The issue of increasing anti-smoking funding was also the focus of the general meeting's proposal. Therefore, it was resolved to request the provincial government to moderately increase the funding in the provincial budget, and for the anti-smoking associations in various counties to increase the number of investigators and add funding. It was requested that the provincial government implement this in the next year. As for the funding for the anti-smoking departments in various counties, it was advocated that the funding should be determined according to the number of opium addicts and the complexity of the tasks. This should also be implemented in the next year.</p>
<p>Opium Addicts' Treatment Problems: Opium addiction treatment centers in various counties should improve their equipment. Special training should be given for chemical testing techniques, the number of free places should be expanded, and the testing fees should be reduced. After opium addicts quit, they should stay in the treatment center for another week for observation. If opium addicts in various counties evade the treatment, they should be severely punished and prevented from relapsing after quitting. If opium addicts serve as members or staff of public groups, they must be treated in advance.</p>
<p>Opium Paraphernalia Should Be Under Unified Control: The opinions in the proposals are summarized as follows: All opium pipes and lamps originally used by opium-smoking households and opium-selling places must be registered and numbered with the seal of the district office where they are located within a prescribed time limit. All opium pipes and lamps of opium addicts who have been treated and quit must be chemically tested, matched, and burned. Before the end of June of this year, households that do not smoke opium and have opium paraphernalia in stock should report to the district office in charge for destruction. If discovered after the deadline, they will be treated as private opium smokers. The provincial association should send a letter to the provincial government to order the county to quickly implement the "magpie's nest is occupied by the cuckoo" (i.e., confiscate).</p>
<p>Reporting Opium Addicts: Combining everyone's opinions, reporting opium addicts should be handled in accordance with the prescribed procedures. If those who are treated and tested are found to be not addicted, they should be released immediately and should not be detained arbitrarily. The chemical testing fee should be borne by the plaintiff. If they refuse to accept the decision of the opium addiction treatment center and request a re-examination, it should be approved without exception. If the re-examination shows that they are addicted, they should be punished more severely.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Songjiang: Xin Town Chamber of Commerce Must Be Re-elected <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Half of the members of the first session of the Xin Zhuang Town Chamber of Commerce in the county have completed their terms of office. Therefore, at 9:00 AM on April 20th, the third member representative assembly was convened to re-elect the members in accordance with the law. On that day, 57 member representatives, including Qian Jizhang, attended. Commissioner Xu Zhao of the County Party Department was sent to attend and guide the election. The county government sent Chen Changshan, the head of the third district, as a representative to supervise the election. After performing the rituals, Jin Zhecheng, Wang Zhaoyun, and Shi Guihang were elected as the presidium. The instructors and supervisors gave speeches.

<p>Various rural areas in Xiyi have received orders to take advantage of the spring agricultural slack season to quickly dredge rivers, and work has already started separately. Details are as follows: The Yang Yuan River in the Tenth District was previously estimated for the project by the Construction Bureau, and the deadline for dredging was set. However, due to the large size of the dam construction project, work has not yet started. Now, in accordance with the provincial labor service regulations, the county government has ordered Assistant Zhou Yeping from the district to work with Qian Nianwen, the head of Yangshuyuan Town, and Kuang Bo'an, the head of Kuangqiao Township, to supervise the work, which has now started. The Zhang Miao She River in Zhang Miao She Township in the Sixth District has been decided to be dredged by the village chief meeting.

<p>Last year, the Runfeng Rice Mill in this county dismissed four workers, including Zhang Yinchang. The labor union believed that they were dismissed without reason, and a dispute arose between labor and management. It has been more than eight months since then, and the labor's demand for the factory to continue employing them has not been resolved. Strikes and petitions have occurred repeatedly. Now, the Central Ministry of Industry and Commerce has approved that the dismissed workers should be reinstated in accordance with the Trade Union Law. However, the management also handles the matter according to the Factory Law of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, resulting in prolonged unresolved situation. On the 20th of this month, the rice mill workers stopped working again and gathered to petition both the party and the government, demanding the implementation of the arbitration agreement. At that time, the county secretary went to Wuxi for a meeting, and the section chief was unwilling to take responsibility, causing the petitioning workers to gather and wait for the secretary to return to Changshu for implementation. In the evening, the workers camped out to wait for a resolution. Various labor unions learned about the situation, and people such as rickshaw pullers and barbers bought bread and other food to console them. However, the rice hall stated that the workers were pulled away by Zhang Yinchang and others to strike without reason, causing the hall to be shut down and resulting in heavy losses. They have informed the labor union that if the workers do not return to work in the hall on the 21st, they will be considered to have resigned automatically. As a result, the gap between labor and management is widening, and it is difficult to resolve the situation for the time being.</p>

<p>The farm household of Zhu Kaitong, located about three miles northeast of Shi Zhuang Township in the sixth district of this county, is quite wealthy, which attracted the attention of bandits. At about 1:00 AM last night (the 18th), more than a dozen bandits, each carrying guns, knives, and flashlights, broke into the house, waking up the family members. They searched everywhere and only found more than one hundred yuan in cash and jewelry and clothing worth about two hundred yuan, which was not enough to satisfy them. They then tied up Zhu himself with ropes, beat him severely, forced him to hand over the hidden silver, and used fire to burn his armpits. Zhu could not bear the pain and said that there was one hundred yuan in cash under the stove. The bandits went to get it as he said and then fled with the loot. The total loss is estimated at more than four hundred yuan.</p>

<p>Chen Guiqing, the magistrate of Haimen County, recognizing that the county seat is a densely populated area lacking a proper public recreational area, purchased more than ten mu of private land north of the old West Garden to develop a park. The budget is 5,000 yuan, which was approved by the Construction Department to be used from the county's reserve fund. The preliminary shape of the park is now taking shape, and various flowers and trees have been planted. The Construction Section is currently drafting plans for the pavilions and bridges to be built and will start construction. In addition, Gu Shaoqing, the general manager of the Shanghai Huacheng Tobacco Company, and squire Wang Yijing, both natives of the county, each donated 500 yuan to build two pavilions. The plans were drafted by the design committee member Lu Qinmin, and construction is scheduled to begin on the first day of next month.</p>

<p>There are a total of seventeen main roads in Haimen County. They have been in disrepair for years, and the road surface is uneven. The county government has long planned to add cinders and prepared a budget, which was submitted to the Construction Department for approval last winter. The instruction was received that the plan was feasible, but before the Puqi Highway is built, the route may be changed, so it seems unnecessary to add cinders first, and it is difficult to approve. Last month, Gu Shiyi, a technician from the Construction Department, and Zhao Zuzhang, a resident engineer from Nantong, came to Haimen to inspect the road construction. Both believed that it was necessary to expedite the repairs. After receiving the instruction, Section Chief Jiang first added cinders to the section connecting Nantong to the county seat, which is more than 20 li long. The cinders needed were all supplied by the three factories, and the cars were used for loading and transportation. The project can be completed within days. Section Chief Jiang is currently drafting a plan to add cinders to all the main roads in the county. The budget plan was delivered to technician Wang Jie yesterday for drafting, and it will be submitted to the department for approval and implementation as soon as it is drafted.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Li Shizeng Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Central Committee member Li Shizeng traveled to Europe and America at the end of last year. He returned to Shanghai yesterday at 12:30 PM aboard the Empress of Japan, a ship of the Chang &amp; Co. Upon arrival, former Minister of Justice and Administration Wei Daoming, Xiao Jinfang representing Central Committee member Wang Chonghui, Li's secretary Li Xixian, and friends Pang Zanchen, Chen Mengzhao, Qi Yunqing, and others went to the ship to welcome him. Li met with reporters from the Xin Sheng News Agency on the ship and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>The Journey: Li first said, "Due to international cultural affairs, I must go abroad once a year to make contacts. This time, I departed in December last year and first went to the United States to carry out the establishment of an international library in New York. Then, I crossed the Atlantic to Europe, visited the Chinese International Libraries in Geneva and Paris, Switzerland and France, and then crossed the Atlantic again, taking a ship from Canada back to China. This trip lasted four months. Besides the aforementioned tasks, there were no other missions."</p>
<p>European Situation: Li then answered reporters' questions, saying, "The world situation is changing rapidly. One does not know what will happen tomorrow. For example, regarding the situation in Europe, one or two days before the German army entered the Rhineland, I was in Strasbourg, France, visiting the largest printing house in France. The bureau specializes in the publication of large dictionaries and encyclopedias, which are world-famous. Unexpectedly, only a few dozen hours after I left the place, this sudden incident occurred. As for what will happen in the future, whether this will lead to a major war, I dare not say."</p>
<p>Unity Issue: The reporter then raised the issue of the sincere unity that all parties are currently working for and asked Li for his opinion. According to his answer, "I have been abroad for months and am not yet clear about the domestic situation. This matter is a long story. I feel like asking 'where to begin talking about the Twenty-Four Histories.' Now that Mr. Hu Zhantang has returned to China, when I arrived in Europe, Mr. Hu had already left Europe, and I did not get to meet him. This time I returned to China by ship from America, and I was unable to go through the ports of Hong Kong and Guangdong, so I did not get to meet him either. After arriving in Shanghai, I will visit Mr. Wang Liangchou. I will also have to go to Nanjing to visit President Jiang and others to catch up."</p>

<p>Strive for Prudence and Avoid Haste During the Transition Period. Yu Qiaqing and others from the Ningbo Association in Shanghai believe that the Yinxian government's demolition and relocation of graves in the market towns is not being handled according to procedures, causing unrest among the villagers. They have proposed three measures and submitted them to the Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government for adoption in order to show compassion. The original submission stated: "We humbly submit that our association recently learned that the demolition and relocation of graves in various townships under the jurisdiction of Ji (Ningbo) is being handled hastily, causing overseas compatriots to protest. In addition, the Yinxian government recently announced that all existing floating coffins and exposed coffins in the old urban area must be demolished by the 15th of May. The villagers are extremely anxious after hearing the news. We have already submitted a request to your office on the 9th to correct this matter. We received a reply from your office, showing your Excellency's utmost concern for the people. We admire you immensely. We have investigated that Yinci counties are handling this case without following procedures and without considering the situation, causing unrest among the villagers. This is a dispute in Ningbo that has not occurred in recent years. Based on our limited perspective, we believe that there are several aspects that should be corrected, and we respectfully present them to your Excellency. The first is the procedural issue. Moving graves must first have a public cemetery as a place for them to be relocated. This way, the graves being moved will not have nowhere to go. Now, let us ask how many townships have already established public cemeteries, and what is the capacity of the existing public cemeteries? The county government has not yet unified them, and it is difficult for each township to popularize them. However, those in charge disregard the facts and focus solely on registration and urging relocation. The people do not know what to do, leading to complaints. In recent times, the graves that have been forced to be relocated have had no choice but to be moved into the mountains. The price of mountain land has soared, and the work of building graves has become busy. The cost of moving one grave is at least over one hundred gold. If they still need to be moved into the public cemetery in the future, they will inevitably fall into double the labor and expense. If we put ourselves in their shoes, how many can not complain? For the government's sake, it is advisable to urge the townships to concentrate their efforts on establishing public cemeteries. When the public cemeteries are completed, then demand that the people relocate, so that things can be fair and the resentment can be eliminated. This concerns the handling</p>

If the Railway Bureau or the Company encounters a train or plane stopping or being unable to proceed midway, or for other reasons, it needs to cancel the passenger's seat or berth and return all or part of the joint transportation fare to the passenger, the passenger should submit the relevant ticket to the departure station of the Railway Bureau or the Company or the station where the journey is stopped for visa. Then, the Railway Bureau or the Company will refund all or part of the ticket price to the passenger and invalidate the original ticket. 10. The inquiry method stipulated in Article 2, for the Railway Bureau and the Company's transfer stations, both parties may inquire nearby. If one party does not have a transfer station, the other party may notify the transfer station by telegram or telephone for inquiry, depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Settlement of Joint Transportation Fees</p>
<p>11. Joint transportation ticket fees will be settled once a month. Before the 10th of each month, the joint transportation statements of each camp for the previous month (such as ticket sales statements and ticket refund statements) shall be exchanged between the two parties for detailed verification. The accounting department of the Railway Bureau shall prepare a settlement list and hand it over to the Company clearly on the 24th of the same month. 12. The tickets sold or collected by both parties, together with the canceled tickets, should be reported to each other on a monthly basis for verification. 13.

When selling road-air joint transportation tickets, ticket sellers from both parties must have the passenger declare that, when boarding the plane, they should personally sign under the abstract of the Company's passenger regulations on the back of the joint transportation ticket and hand it over to the person in charge of the airport for safekeeping.</p>
<p>Contract Period of One Year</p>
<p>16. This platform will be in the same format from May 1, 1936 to April 30, 1937, with a one-year trial period. If both parties are willing to continue, they should notify each other in person one month before the expiration date. 17. If there are any matters not covered by this contract, the other party may be notified in writing one month in advance to negotiate revisions.</p>
<p>Both Parties Are Signing</p>
<p>Attached are the prices of various departments of the two roads and airlines, all of which have been corrected into three identical copies. The operations group director of Eurasia Aviation Company, Liao Guanxuan, is signing them and submitting them to General Manager Li Jing for approval. Then, a letter will be sent to the Railway Bureau, signed by the head of the transportation department, Xiao Weiguo, deputy director Liu Dingxin, and Wang Zhigang, and submitted to Director Huang Boqiao and Deputy Director Wu Shaozeng for approval before taking effect. Each party shall hold one copy as proof. However, the company stated regarding the provisions of Article 8 that no refunds may be requested at intermediate stations during air travel and has notified the Railway Bureau. As for the passenger ticket, the format has also been determined, with a total of five copies. In addition to the stub retained by the passenger, the first and second copies will be collected for verification when boarding the plane and alighting from the train. The third copy is the regular ticket, with the child ticket attached. Note 1: It will be collected upon arrival at the destination station. Each copy details the departure and arrival stations and the transfer station designated by the passenger. There is also an abstract of the company's regulations attached for passengers to consult. The procedures that need to be corrected are also described. 1. Regarding the area issue, the current demolition and relocation of graves is not based on the county as a unit, but on the township or town as a unit. Often, township A has already carried out the relocation, while town B still allows new construction. Within the same county, there is this extreme contradictory situation. The people clearly observe and listen, but cannot decide whether to comply. The names and areas of townships and towns have been repeatedly changed in recent years, sometimes dividing the whole into parts, and sometimes merging B into A. Villagers live in their place but do not know the name of their township or town. Moreover, those who are buried here are not necessarily people from their township or town. Those who are from different townships, different towns, or different counties, and who are distant guests from other places, are also often found. If the township or town head urges registration and relocation every day, even though announcements have been issued and advertisements have been placed, it is already difficult to expect people to know about it through local newspapers that are only sold in Ningbo Port and announcements posted in one town or township. In addition, the names and areas of their townships and towns are not fully understood by the people, so the effectiveness of the announcement can be said to be equal to zero. If people are blamed for not registering on time, and if demolition and relocation are carried out when they do not register, and the entrusted person is not the right person, the supervision may not be perfect, and opportunities are taken to engage in personal gain. Bad people take the opportunity to allude, and there are those who are suddenly discovered without being designated by the township or town office. There are those who impersonate the township or town office and extort money. According to reports from villagers, the recent demolition of graves in the eastern part of Yinxian County focuses on the large and intact ones, while the dilapidated and exposed coffins are given a slow treatment. What is the intention? It is not necessary to ask. What crime have the villagers committed to suffer such trampling? Tracing back to the reason, it is because the township is self-governing, which is extremely harmful. It is advisable for the county government to handle it in a unified manner according to the regulations, and at the same time, clearly announce the registration deadline and publish it in various newspapers in Shanghai so that everyone can know it, so that all those who have graves in the county know where the rules are and there will be no ambiguity in the measures, so as to avoid being excavated due to misunderstanding. This concerns the area of handling that should be corrected. The second is the time issue. According to Ningbo customs, grave sacrifices are usually held during Qingming. It is rare to go to the countryside to sacrifice to graves at other times. Townships and towns often arbitrarily set the deadline for registering graves, sometimes setting it in March or May, extending it for one or two months, and then closing it immediately. It is not easy to make the general public aware of the opportunity unless it happens to be during the Qingming sacrifice period. It is advisable to set a generous deadline so that people can register as much as possible. The registration period should start before Qingming of the previous year and end after Qingming of the next year. Those who still have not registered according to the regulations after two sweeping and sacrificing periods should be designated as ownerless graves, so as to avoid the suspicion of arbitrary decisions. This concerns the handling of time that should be corrected. 3. Summarizing the above three points, they are all the shortcomings of the current handling. Unless they are corrected one by one, it will be difficult to eliminate the disturbances and facilitate the promotion. Some argue that the current disturbances are due to the poor burial system in the past, which is true. However, reforming the old system also has its own gradual process and a considerable period of time. The ancients have warned us that haste makes waste. Everyone secretly discusses and believes that moving floating graves and limiting the future are appropriate ways to deal with filling graves at present. Going beyond this limit involves complexity and harshness. Our fellow villager Committee Member Jiang Weifang will govern the world with filial piety. Reports on the relocation of graves in Guangdong Province have been repeatedly seen in newspapers and spread among the villagers as a good story. We believe that the government officials should admire the meaning of the Chairman's intention and promote his benevolence to all kinds. When handling this case, we must strive for prudence and avoid haste. Who is not a child of man? Who does not have ancestral graves? When one thinks of this, how can one not be fearful? If one manages this matter with utmost care, there is nothing that will not be done with even more care. If this is the way the world is influenced, the morals of the people will return to generosity, and the governance will become prosperous. Due to the previous reasons, we have gathered the public opinion of the villagers and presented our humble opinions. We humbly request your office to adopt them and order the counties under the jurisdiction of Old Ningbo to implement them. We cannot wait anxiously. Ningbo Association in Shanghai, Yu Qiaqing and others respectfully submit to the Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government issued an order to establish township and town cemeteries and ordered the districts to follow the regulations. It is heard that Minhang and Zhuanqiao and other places have plans to prepare for construction. Yesterday, the county government also instructed the district chiefs, stating that for prosperous towns and cities or villages with mostly rice fields that are not suitable for building graves, appropriate areas should be found in other nearby townships and towns for construction. As for mountains and barren land, if the property rights are privately owned, they can be requisitioned according to law.</p>

<p>Due to the Yangzhuang tea firms' inability to operate because the Anhui Provincial Government is controlling Qimen tea, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce resolved to suspend foreign exchange transactions. The Chamber persuaded them to postpone the suspension for two days, implementing it from the 23rd. Meanwhile, it telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government, requesting the adoption of the tea industry's demands, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the Chamber received a telegraph from the Provincial Government yesterday, and urgently telegraphed the Shanghai Municipality, and submitted another petition to the Shanghai Municipal Government, requesting the telegraphing of the Anhui Provincial Government to order the retraction of loans. Special inquiries reveal the following telegrams:</p>
<p>Anhui Provincial Government Telegram</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government telegraphed a reply to Yu Qiaqing, stating: "To Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, your kind telegram has been received. The improvement of black tea transportation and sales in both provinces takes into account both tea farmers and tea merchants. If the tea firms in Shanghai can fully accept and implement the points mentioned in the telegram, it would be most appropriate. The submission from the association, delivered only recently, contains many discrepancies compared to what the representatives negotiated in the province. Instructions have been given to proceed according to the telegram. We hope for your strong and sincere persuasion to benefit the tea industry. Anhui Provincial Government Chairman Liu Zhenhua, with seal."</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Urgent Telegram: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce urgently telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government in Anqing, stating: "Your Excellency, Anhui Provincial Government, your telegram has been received. We have just received a statement from all tea firm merchants, stating that the Anhui Provincial Government's reply to Mr. Yu Qiaqing instructs our Chamber to fully accept the points mentioned in the telegram. We have investigated and found that the True Telegram is subject to the supervision and direction of the transportation and sales office, which is completely obstructed according to reason and cannot be followed. We intend to adhere to the requests in the submission on the first day of the month, where each firm will set up a sales office, open a report of the tea market daily, and submit it to the transportation and sales office. Upon arrival of the tea, the transportation and sales office will immediately send the bill of lading to the sales office jointly formed by the tea firms, so that there is capital turnover. Other methods shall be in accordance with the submission on the first day of the month. After investigating the submission on the first day of the month and what the representatives proposed in the province, there are only four points added, and the rest are completely the same. We implore you to show compliance. All tea firms in our Chamber stretch their necks and stand on tiptoe, waiting for your final orders, otherwise they will inevitably walk into the dead end of suspending foreign exchange transactions and closing their businesses on the 23rd." An investigation reveals that the industry's proposal to open a report of the tea market daily is under the supervision of the transportation and sales office, which is what our Chamber's telegram means by following the True Telegram and handling it in a compromise manner. In addition, the points listed in the original submission of the Chamber members, according to reports, are the same as the face-to-face negotiations in the province. We implore your Excellency to consider the tea firms, which are a Chinese export industry with a long history, and show extraordinary compassion to fully preserve the foundation and avoid sudden changes. The tea industry is following the persuasion of our Chamber to postpone the suspension of foreign exchange transactions and business closures from the 23rd. If, before the deadline, we do not obtain your Excellency's order to adopt the telegram, the suspension of foreign exchange transactions must be implemented, which will inevitably increase commercial panic and affect finance. The situation is urgent. Awaiting your telegram reply. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, respectfully."</p>
<p>Tomorrow's Suspension of Foreign Exchange Transactions: A reporter from the New Voice Society obtained definite news from the Yangzhuang Tea Industry Association yesterday that the tea firms' resolution to suspend foreign exchange transactions is actually for the sake of fighting for survival. The Chamber of Commerce is currently strongly persuading them to postpone it for two days, implementing it from the 23rd. If the Anhui Provincial Government is unwilling to be understanding and accepting, then the tea firms will have no business to operate and will have no choice but to suspend the exchange of bills and announce it to the people in order to seek public judgment, it is said.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>"To His Excellency, the Shanghai Municipal Government, on the 20th of this month, according to a letter from the Shanghai Yangzhuang Tea Industry Association, it states: 'Our association previously stated that the Anhui Provincial Government planned to control the transportation and sale of black tea, which hindered business. Earlier, a telegram from Dong expressly promised not to hinder the tea firms' lending, but now goes back on their word, which is tantamount to trapping people in a pit. We have repeatedly asked your esteemed association to telegraph the Anhui Provincial Government to request exemption from discussion in order to relieve commercial difficulties. At the same time, we sent Sun Xiquan, etc., to Anhui to petition, and they have stated the position of the tea firms, the situation of lending, and all opinions to Yang, the Director of the Department of Finance, and Liu, the Director of the Department of Construction, reasonably. The representatives also took into account the government's credibility and the merchants' business, and under the circumstances of considering both sides, they drafted a compromise method and presented the draft, sincerely discussing it. Subsequently, Chen, the secretary of the competent department, and others informed them that if they could obtain the consent of the industry when they returned to Shanghai and submit a revised formal presentation, they would approve the telegram reply. This government need not lend separately, etc.' Our association then submitted this presentation on the first day of the month by post, and it was also sent by Hong Mengpan, Chen Yizhou, and others, and your esteemed association repeatedly re-telegraphed the situation in the case. Since the opening of trade, the position of the tea firms and the freedom of the people to operate businesses should be protected by law. Even if we discuss this year's lending, it was because we received a reply from the Anhui Provincial Government in advance that it would not hinder it, that we actively raised funds and invested. If the Anhui Provincial Government is not forgetful, it should clearly know that the tea firms' business starts with lending and ends with sales, which is a consistent commercial practice that cannot be analyzed separately. It is inappropriate to explicitly promise in advance and then discuss the method of controlling transportation and sales later, using the excuse of revitalizing the tea industry to exhaust the profits of merchants. Therefore, from our association's perspective, even if we insist on maintaining the original business model unchanged, it would be legally justified and logically reasonable. Moreover, the aforementioned compromise method has indeed sought a compromise. Because we saw that the tea season was approaching and time was pressing, we did not want to suspend the case indefinitely, causing long-term disturbances, leading to disadvantages for tea merchants and farmers, and taking into account the overall situation with great pains. We were waiting for a reply, but unexpectedly, the Anhui Provincial Government did not issue it and instead proceeded with lending in the Qimen production area to the tea houses that had already received firm loans, which shows that they have gone back on their word repeatedly and are attempting to fulfill their exclusive desires. There is no need to conceal that they are operating a provincial monopoly. Such deliberate destruction will not only make it impossible for the tea firms' business to continue in the future, but also cause the current millions of loans to be on the verge of falling through. Under the circumstances where black tea is being sacrificed, green tea has no more energy to take care of it. Bankruptcy and collapse are imminent. At this time when all industries are sluggish and the market is very depressed, what impact will the tea industry have on the producing provinces if it is allowed to decline? We will not discuss it for the time being. However, if the tea firms in this city, which occupy an important position, all perish, then the disastrous impression that will affect the entire city will be unbearable. Our association, in view of the seriousness of the situation, has not only stopped the release of all black tea loans and waited quietly for a solution, but also corresponded to your esteemed association, requesting you to quickly present the case to the Shanghai Municipal Government to appeal for relief and immediately telegraph the Anhui Provincial Government for strict negotiations to maintain business and protect the market. Based on this, after the news of the Qimen tea control was published in the newspapers, the association repeatedly sent letters to the industry association to request rescue. After receiving a letter from the National Economic Committee, it replied that the purpose of the previous tea technology discussion meeting was to improve Chinese tea and there was no matter of controlling Qimen tea. The transportation and sales method is still under careful study and will not hinder the tea firms' lending, etc. Now the Anhui authorities have gone back on their word, and the four compromise methods presented by the three representatives of the industry have not been approved. In the Qimen production area, loans are being implemented to the tea houses that have already received firm loans. The industry was alarmed upon hearing the news and convened an emergency meeting of the industry on the 19th of this month, resolving to stop the release of all red and green tea loans. The association, in view of the urgency of the situation, advised the industry to postpone the aforementioned resolution for two days and urgently telegraph the competent authorities to telegraph a fair solution. We hereby submit this matter to your honorable government for observation, and request your honorable government to telegraph the Anhui Provincial Government, instructing the Black Tea Transportation and Sales Association to retract the loans from the tea houses that have already received firm loans. On the one hand, we instruct them to follow the four compromise methods presented by the three representatives, so as to maintain the dwindling life of the tea firms, which is for the public good. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, respectfully."</p>

<p>After Wang Xiaolai was elected as an executive committee member of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession in the current election, he immediately sent a letter to the association resigning, stating: "I have been undeservedly elected to the executive committee. I am extremely apprehensive. I once declared on the spot that I am not virtuous enough to convince people, nor talented enough to adapt to changes. After nine years of abusing my position, I have not benefited the association in any way. I reiterate my previous statement to express my sincerity. I beg you to consider and approve my request." After receiving the letter, the association sent a reply earnestly retaining him, stating: "Upon receiving your letter requesting to resign from the position of executive committee member of this association, it was reported to the first executive committee meeting of this session and discussed. Everyone agreed that you have long been known for your leadership in the work of this association. In recent years, you have participated in the Municipal Council's municipal administration and strived for the rights of Chinese taxpayers. We rely on you to preside over the current difficult times in the country. We especially rely on your talents to overcome difficulties. It was resolved to unanimously retain you. We are sending this letter especially to reply, and we hope that you will comply with the wishes of the public and jointly plan for development." Also, more than 50 organizations including the First Special District Citizens' Federation, the Shaoxing Seven Counties Shanghai Fellow-Provincials Association, the Chinese National Products Manufacturers' Federation, the Subei Shanghai Fellow-Provincials Association, the Haimen Shanghai Fellow-Provincials Association, the Common Fellow-Provincials Association, the Rugao Fellow-Provincials Association, the Shanghai Retail Cloth Industry Association, and the Jiangsu Fellow-Provincials Association also sent letters to Wang Xiaolai retaining him, stating: "We recently read in the newspaper that you sent a letter resigning from the executive committee of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association. We were very apprehensive after reading it. The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Special District is not only a backing organization for our diplomacy, but also a community that concentrates our Chinese rights. Therefore, its responsibilities are extremely important and large-scale. It is not enough to elect those who are highly virtuous and prestigious to represent public opinion. This time, you have been elected by popular demand as an executive committee member of this session, and we are deeply gratified that we have found the right person. In addition to the fact that the entire executive committee of your association has resolved to retain you, we dare to jointly sign this letter requesting you to dismiss your intention to resign and bravely take on the heavy responsibility. This is not only what we hope for, but also the happiness of the future of the citizens of our special district."</p>

<p>The newly appointed Army Military Attaché to the Japanese Embassy in China, Kita Seiichi, came to China to take up his new post. He arrived in Shanghai at 3:40 PM yesterday, accompanied by his wife and daughter, on the Japanese ship Asama Maru. The ship docked at the Huishan Wharf. Wang Changchun, a commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Government, Zhou Jue, the director of the Diplomatic Ministry's Shanghai Office, and Wakasugi, a councilor of the Japanese Embassy in China, Ishishe, the consul-general in Shanghai, Ueda, the head of the police corps, Utsunomiya, the military attaché stationed in Beijing, Sakamoto, and dozens of representatives of Japanese residents in Shanghai welcomed him at the port. After greeting each welcoming person, Kita met with Chinese and Japanese newspaper reporters. According to him, the rumors that he would convene a meeting of military attachés stationed in China after taking office are not true. As for the Japanese military's plan to increase the number of troops stationed in North China, as of today, not a single soldier has been added. It has not yet been decided when he will go to Beijing to pay respects to the Chinese authorities. It is also a misunderstanding that he will go to Southern China, he said.</p>
<p>A Telecommunications Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 21st reported: "The military authorities believe that the attitude of the National Government and the situation in North China are not optimistic. After Kita, the military attaché stationed in China, who is currently on his way to take office, inspects the local situation, a major meeting will be held in Qingdao around June, gathering military attachés stationed in various parts of China. The central government will also send powerful officials concerned to China to comprehensively review China policy, especially relations with the Soviet Union, focusing on the results of Kita's military attaché's inspection and reports from local military attachés, and comprehensively review China's policy towards Japan and the Soviet Union in order to establish a concrete plan for implementing continental policy, and advance in the same direction as the military streamlining and national administration reform currently underway."</p>

<p>The Chinese General Federation of Industry sent letters to members in various places yesterday, stating: "We have received a letter from the Municipal Government, stating that the Vancouver Consulate General's letter No. Wen Zi 463 states that the Vancouver Municipal Government states that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the founding of Vancouver, Canada. The government has scheduled a large-scale celebration from July 1st to the end of September. Please notify Chinese merchants to participate in the celebration, etc. After our consulate gathered various Chinese merchants to discuss, they unanimously agreed to join the celebration. However, there is no way to collect Canadian local specialty products, so Chinese merchants are raising funds to select Situ Guojun to return to China to purchase them. Please ask our consulate to send a letter to your government stating that when Mr. Situ arrives, please send personnel to take care of and assist in everything, etc. The above mentioned matters are all true. Furthermore, this is a good opportunity to promote domestic products and develop Sino-Canadian trade. We hereby send a letter to your government requesting you to investigate. When Mr. Situ pays a visit, please allow personnel to meet him and guide him to visit, and provide all assistance, etc." We are preparing a letter to notify you. We have also received a letter from Situ Guo, the General Representative of the Chinese Cultural and Art Exhibition in Canada, stating: "The 50th anniversary of the founding of Vancouver will be held from July 25th to September 7th. Local overseas Chinese are preparing to participate in the celebration and have specially built five exhibition venues in the center of the Chinese district to exhibit our country's culture and goods. Representatives have been sent back to China to collect materials and high-quality domestic goods. We sincerely hope that your association members will work hard to participate in order to promote national glory and promote goods. Our association will be very honored. If you have any guidance, please contact our association's Shanghai office at Room 1, 2nd Floor, China Trust, 156 Beijing Road," etc. Vancouver is a Canadian city located on the Pacific coast, and it takes more than ten days to reach it by ship. There are many overseas Chinese there. If you are willing to participate, it is a good opportunity to promote domestic goods. We are sending this letter to inform you and hope that you will contact the above address directly."</p>

<h3 id="e120">Daily Meetings Will Be Held Starting on the 1st <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Since the government's new currency system policy and the unrestricted buying and selling of foreign exchange by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications were implemented, the foreign exchange market rate is announced daily by the Central Bank, and domestic exchange has become balanced. The Shanghai Bankers Association's previous Market Rate Committee is no longer necessary and was immediately disbanded. Now, in order to improve their business, the banks have decided to reorganize the Market Rate Committee into a Bankers' Business Mutual Benefit Association, which belongs to the same industry association as the Bankers' Society.</p>
<p>Establishment Purpose: The association's articles of association have been approved by the eighth executive committee meeting of the Bankers Association. Its purpose is: A. To connect the friendship of colleagues and to facilitate the handover of affairs in the same industry. B. To assist each other in studying all the main issues in business. C. To investigate the financial market conditions and visit various industries. Members are divided into basic members and proficient members. All member banks of the Bankers Association are basic members. All non-member banks of the Bankers Association are ordinary members, and a committee is established to preside over it.</p>
<p>Prior Meetings: In addition to the member banks of the Bankers Association joining as basic members, the Central Bank and other banks have joined as ordinary members. It is stipulated that at 10:00 AM every day, each bank should send one representative to gather at the Bankers Association meeting (except Sundays and holidays), report on the financial market conditions in various ports to each other, and study the improvement of business. Now each bank has sent personnel (i.e., the former Market Rate Committee representatives) to the Bankers Association meeting for about one hour starting on April 1st, and a check-in book is prepared for the representatives to sign.</p>
<p>Further General Meeting: The association has decided to hold a general meeting in the near future to elect a committee of about 15 members and elect one chairman and one vice-chairman to preside over everything. If there are opinions on improving banking business, they will be submitted to the association's executive committee for handling after being approved by the association. In the future, it will be decided to solicit various non-member banks to join as ordinary members, and various rules are being drafted by the association.</p>

<p>The China Mining Association believes that foreign coal is being dumped in China, and domestic coal is inconvenient to transport and the mining tax is too high, making it difficult to compete with foreign coal. In order to save the situation, the representatives of all members decided at a general meeting to submit a petition to the Ministry of Industry to transfer it to the Ministry of Finance for a reduction of the mining tax. After receiving the Ministry's instructions, they were instructed to fill in the actual annual output, sales price, and exact amount of mining tax of each mine in detail and report them in order to verify and transfer them, etc. The association immediately formulated forms and distributed them to various mines. More than 30 detailed forms filled out by the Six River Gulch and North China mines have been received one after another. They are currently being reviewed separately. After completing the procedures, they will be submitted to the Ministry of Industry and the details of each mine will be reported to request the Ministry of Finance to reduce the mining tax again in order to reduce costs, fight against foreign coal, prevent leaks, and benefit the mining industry.</p>

<p>According to the Park Management Office of the Public Concession's report for March, the total number of visitors to various parks and children's playgrounds this month was 285,911, an increase of more than 134,000 compared to the previous month.

<h3 id="e126">Skin Thread Tobacco Association Submits to the Tax Bureau: Requesting Prohibition of Special Tax on Fujian Tobacco Threads; Tobacco Threads are Made with Ingredients, Cannot be Taxed the Same as Tobacco Leaves <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Skin Thread Tobacco Association, due to the Fujian Tingzhou Tax Collection Bureau's unauthorized addition of a special tax on tobacco threads, has specially submitted a request to the Tax Bureau, requesting a prohibition. The original text reads: "Submitting a request regarding the Fujian Tingzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Collection Bureau's unauthorized addition of a special tax on tobacco threads, which is demanding and distorting, violating established cases, coercing and obstructing, hindering freight transport, earnestly requesting strict prohibition to alleviate merchants' difficulties and maintain regulations."</p>
<p>"According to reports from fellow businesses in Minnan and Yongding, the Fujian Tingzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Collection Bureau, using the excuse of untaxed tobacco threads, has decided to implement a presumed tax increase from April 1st of this year. Fearing that the increase would be insufficient, they have also ordered the provision of a guarantee bond, holding them responsible for supplementary payments. Tobacco merchants cannot bear the burden, and goods cannot be shipped out, resulting in obstruction and coercion. Both domestic and foreign merchants are deeply angered and have requested the association to quickly negotiate based on reason, striving to restore the original state and expedite commerce."</p>
<p>"A copy of the Tingzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Collection Bureau's tax increase announcement and a guarantee bond form have been sent to the association. Based on this, the regulations regarding the special tax on native tobacco stipulate separate calculations of the quantity of native tobacco leaves that have not had their veins removed and net tobacco leaves that have had their veins removed, with different collection provisions. The original principle was to apply it to the taxation of tobacco leaves. As for the method of including non-special zones into special zones, those taxing tobacco threads are all taxed according to the weight of the tobacco threads at the prescribed rate, regardless of the tobacco leaves required to make the tobacco threads and the amount of veins removed. For the past three years, skin threads, Chaozhou tobacco, etc., have all been taxed according to this method. Therefore, the quantity stipulated for the taxation of skin thread tobacco is 67 catties per hundred packages. The so-called 67 catties refers to the quantity of net tobacco threads, not the quantity of tobacco leaves, and especially disregarding the amount of veins removed."</p>
<p>"The Tingzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau is completely ignorant of the process of handling this case and the original intention of taxing tobacco threads, and has presumptuously acted clever, distorted the established regulations, and falsely associated them with provincial orders (provincial orders for tax increases refer to tobacco, not tobacco threads). They have added tobacco veins to the tobacco threads for joint taxation, treating tobacco leaves and tobacco threads as one, thinking that they can increase the country's tax revenue and perform a small service. However, they are unaware that they are deeply involved in overturning the established deployment. One discrepancy is that even if tobacco threads are taxed, their quantity should not be estimated based on tobacco leaves, but on the amount of veins removed from the tobacco leaves used to make the tobacco threads, which should not be added to the tax outside the quantity of tobacco threads. Tobacco threads and tobacco leaves are different. Tobacco leaves become pure net tobacco leaves on the tax list after the veins are removed. In addition to net tobacco leaves as the main material, tobacco threads also have a large number of ingredients mixed in, such as oil and water, each accounting for 15% to 20%, and color powder, flower petals, etc., accounting for about 5% to over 10%. The quantity of these ingredients is sufficient to offset the quantity of tobacco veins with a surplus. Since these ingredients are not taxable items and have not been marked out as tax-free within the quantity of tobacco threads, how can the tobacco veins be added to the quantity of tobacco threads for joint taxation? The principle is very clear, but if the Tingzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau does not understand, is it because they are harming merchants or is there another purpose? This is the second discrepancy."</p>
<p>"The Ministry of Finance stipulates that the standard for the taxation quantity of skin thread tobacco is originally 67 catties per hundred packages. Later, for the sake of calculation, the Tingzhou Bureau changed it to 70 catties, exceeding the Ministry's stipulation by 3 catties. The merchants did not haggle over such a small amount, which shows that the merchants have done their best to fulfill their tax obligations within their capabilities. Now, due to the addition of tobacco veins to the tax, it has further increased to 91 catties, and they still think it is not enough, ordering tobacco merchants to guarantee that if it exceeds 91 catties, they will be responsible for any tax losses. Such relentless demands are not the original intention of the country to collect taxes. This is the third discrepancy."</p>
<p>"Regarding the inappropriate methods and the tax increases that change established cases, without the approval of superiors, they have prematurely announced and implemented them, which shows their stubbornness. Moreover, they are coercively obtaining guarantee bonds. Merchants do not owe taxes, and they are coerced into adding taxes. Why should they provide guarantees? If it is said that the assumed tax increase method cannot be implemented effectively, so tobacco merchants must provide guarantees to be responsible for supplementary tax payments, then if the superiors reject the bureau's tax increase, who will guarantee and return the tax payments that have already been collected? There is nothing more deceitful than this. In short, methods that are not practical should not be imposed on the people. This is the fourth discrepancy."</p>
<p>"We believe that maintaining national taxes depends on the cooperation of officials and civilians. Unilateral harassment is not appropriate. The quantity of ingredients used in the manufacture of tobacco threads stated by our association is all based on factual circumstances and does not contain any fabrication. There are many tobacco thread factories in Beijing and Shanghai, which can be easily investigated. If your office believes that the investigation is not credible, then for the sake of the merchants expressing their intentions, they can only request that your office change to taxing tobacco leaves. Furthermore, Yongding in Fujian Province has already been designated as a special tax area and should originally tax tobacco leaves instead of tobacco threads. In the past, it was temporarily handled due to the unrest in the area and the changes of the puppet government, and the special tax on tobacco leaves could not be implemented. The reason why the taxation of tobacco threads has not been changed is simply because the method is simple and definite, officials do not create extraneous branches, and the people are content to comply. Now, the Tingzhou Tax Collection Bureau is wantonly creating chaos, destroying established cases, and once the chaos begins, it is difficult to predict the consequences. If there is no proper way to maintain the situation, then following the Ministry's regulations to tax leaves can fundamentally solve the problem."</p>
<p>"As for the Tingzhou Bureau's false accusation that tobacco veins are evading taxes, hoping to supplement them to gain merit, their wishful thinking and erroneous actions have harmed merchants and disregarded regulations. Whether they should be thoroughly dismissed to suit the merchants' situation and protect the credibility of all Ministry regulations is up to your office to weigh. Our association does not dare to request presumptuously. However, the tobacco threads waiting to be transported in Yongding have been obstructed and delayed by the Tingzhou Bureau and cannot be exported. They have been accumulating for a long time, and mold is a concern. Commerce is not smooth, and both domestic and foreign businesses are deeply harmed. As a last resort, we have specially attached a copy of the Tingzhou Bureau's tax increase announcement and a guarantee bond form and submit this document to your office for review. We humbly request that you quickly order the Tingzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Collection Bureau to immediately cancel the tax increase, restore the original state, and expedite the release of tobacco threads waiting for export to relieve tobacco merchants from their predicament. We are extremely anxious and await your orders." Sincerely submitted.</p>

<p>The Chinese Aviation Association is expanding the national aviation salvation movement, and the Shanghai Municipality is raising funds to purchase aircraft to present to the government as a commemorative gift for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday. The committee previously sent a letter to all theaters and entertainment venues in the city, requesting that they donate one day's income. The details of the Empire and Golden Theaters' performances have been reported in various newspapers. Furthermore, Mr. Huang Jinrong invited actors from all venues of the Great World and famous actors from the Gong Stage to perform for one day, donating all ticket income and the wages of backstage staff and actors. This was held on the previous two days. It is reported that the Great World sold tickets worth $8,459.00. The number for the Gong Stage will be announced later after it is known. Mr. Huang Jinrong, the Great World, and the Gong Stage's enthusiastic support is admirable. Other theaters will soon follow suit. In addition, the association received a letter from the United Actors Association yesterday, stating that the association's fourth regular meeting on the 17th of this month decided that comrades from various stages and theaters would separately choose a day to perform plays, and the proceeds from the seats would be used to purchase aircraft to present to the government to celebrate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's birthday. The association has sent a letter of thanks, requesting them to work hard to promote the event.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the association has been soliciting participation from all circles, organizations, and individuals to become promoters, participation has been very enthusiastic. Recently, we have continued to receive participation from Lu Feibo, Chen Jicheng, Jiang Xianzhi, Song Qiyuan, Zheng Shixu, Kong Fanxi, Dai Yuheng, Zhang Yunhe, Ma Yinliang, Shen Zongyong, Zhu Yaoming, Xu Runsheng, Sun Xiong, Zhou Shenqian, Xu Kaifu, Wang Zhenhai, and others, as well as the Central Bank, Jiangsu Bank Head Office, Guohua Bank, Juxingcheng Bank, China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, Jincheng Bank Head Office, Zhejiang Industrial Bank Head Office, the Antique Industry Association, the Grain, Oil, and Cake Industry Association, and the China Educational Supplies Manufacturing Factory, who have also agreed to participate as promoters. This is enough to see the enthusiastic support from all circles and organizations.</p>

<p>Cui Dongbi's Posthumous Writings is a historical work of great scientific value. His research on ancient Chinese history and his methods of identifying falsehoods are unmatched by any previous historian. However, for more than a hundred years, it has been neglected, which is truly regrettable. Later, Mr. Hu Shi loudly called for it, and his praise has not waned. Mr. Qian Xuantong and Mr. Gu Jiegang followed him, and the book was greatly revealed to the world. Mr. Gu Jiegang spent more than ten years punctuating, editing, and adding many lost manuscripts. Mr. Cui's spirit of scholarship is as clear as the sun and stars. This book is now available for presale reservations by the Shanghai Yadon Library. Orders from all over the country have been overwhelming. However, the deadline is currently approaching, and those who want to buy it are still coming in an endless stream, which is truly a grand occasion in the publishing industry.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Favoring Concubine, Abusing Wife: Ye Bingzhang Accused; Wife Enters a Nunnery to Chant Sutras and Barely Make a Living; Petitioning for One-Time Alimony <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Liu Caiyun, a 39-year-old woman from Suzhou, currently residing at the Jingxinglin of Fayun Lane, Lingyin Temple, Hangzhou, married Ye Bingzhang, a 54-year-old wealthy businessman from Ningbo (currently residing at No. 5, Tongfu Lane, Julai Road, French Concession), as his second wife in the ninth year of the Republic through a matchmaker. Initially, they lived in harmony, but recently, the relationship between the couple,</p>
<p>broke down. Liu hired lawyer Wu Kaisheng to file a lawsuit in the civil court of the Second Court, stating, in brief: "When the plaintiff married the defendant, Ye Daozhou and Zhang Wenlan acted as matchmakers. They married in the Taihe enclosure on Er Ma Road and then lived together in Yao Shuping's house in Xiaotaoyuan in the city. They had a daughter and a son, but both died young. Unexpectedly, the defendant,</p>
<p>getting old and greedy for beauty, actually liked the new and disliked the old. He became acquainted with a prostitute named Huijuan in Huile Lane, and from then on, he regarded the plaintiff as a nail in his eye, abusing her in every possible way. Later, because Huijuan gave birth to a son and a daughter one after another, the defendant's abuse of the plaintiff became even more intensified. On August 20th of the 22nd year of the Republic, she was severely beaten for a trivial matter. From then on, the defendant never returned and did not provide for the plaintiff's</p>
<p>daily life. Helpless, the plaintiff had to reside in the Zhizhi Nunnery in Waicang Bridge, Hangzhou (the Ye family's nunnery), chanting sutras to barely make a living. The defendant's malicious abandonment clearly violates criminal law. After investigating, the defendant has substantial assets and owns real estate, houses, and fields in the original Lai, and has a large deposit in a certain bank. The plaintiff requests permission to live separately and requests the defendant Ye Bingzhang to pay alimony of 13,060 yuan,</p>
<p>paid in one lump sum." The court approved the lawsuit and summoned the parties yesterday morning. The plaintiff, accompanied by her lawyer Wu Kaisheng, and the defendant, accompanied by his lawyers Wu Linkun and Tang Youwei, appeared in court. First, the plaintiff's lawyer described the situation, stating that the case was filed on February 27th to request mediation, but it was unsuccessful, so the lawsuit was formally filed. The defendant abandoned the plaintiff for three years and has never paid a penny, etc. The plaintiff, Liu Caiyun, recounted the husband's</p>
<p>abusive behavior, also claiming that her husband had various misdeeds. The woman, thinking of their relationship as husband and wife, temporarily concealed them. If she were to say them, he (referring to the defendant) would have no place to stand. The woman has to cultivate herself wholeheartedly because of her husband's behavior. However, daily necessities all require money, and she requests that her husband pay at least 80 yuan per month to maintain her livelihood. Ye Bingzhang claimed that the businessman has been unemployed for three years and would have gone bankrupt without the help of relatives. He is now working as a low level employee at the Jicheng Company on Minquan Road, with a monthly salary of only 40 yuan. How can he pay a large amount of alimony? The official asked what amount he was willing to pay the plaintiff. He replied, "At most 15 yuan per month." The plaintiff claimed that the defendant spends no less than 400 to 500 yuan per month, and it is not true that he earns 40 yuan per month. After hearing the statements from both sides, the court earnestly advised them to reconcile. Both lawyers also agreed, and the court adjourned the hearing to May 1st. In the meantime, both parties will try to reconcile outside of court.</p>

<p>Shen Xiangrui, the director of the Municipal Zoo, went to Japan last October to study and investigate methods of preventing and controlling animal diseases. He returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon on the Japanese ship Asama Maru. Mr. Shen also brought back a bear beast donated by Japan, which will be displayed in the zoo soon for citizens to visit. According to Mr. Shen, when speaking to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, after going to Japan last October, he entered the Ueno Imperial Gift Animal Park in Tokyo to study the administration of the zoo, as well as methods of preventing and controlling animal diseases and education. He completed his research on March 12th and went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Cultural Enterprise Department, the Ministry of Culture's Social Affairs Bureau, the Imperial Museum, the Science Museum, the National Defense Museum, the Library, the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, the Bureau of Fisheries, the Bureau of Animal Husbandry, the Animal Husbandry Experimental Field, the Veterinary Epidemic Investigation Institute, and other places such as Nagoya, Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe, Shizuoka, local animal parks, aquariums, chicken farms, and art experimental fields to conduct visits and inspections. In every more prosperous port in Japan, there must be a large-scale zoo and aquarium. The birds and beasts inside are very complete. Precious birds and animals are purchased and displayed at a great cost. Because of the development of animal husbandry and educational talent, there is much that our country can learn from. The knowledge of animal husbandry is too numerous to mention, said Shen. Mr. Shen brought back a bear beast (i.e., a man-bear) this time, which was donated by the Ueno Imperial Gift Animal Park in Tokyo. The beast has black hair all over its body, is fat and bloated, weighs 260-70 pounds, and likes warmth. It eats both meat and vegetables, but it is a bit difficult to feed. It was loaded in a wooden cage and unloaded from the ship that evening and transported to the zoo on Wenmiao Road. It will be open to the public for viewing in the next few days.</p>

<p>The Yu Shunxing iron shop at No. 19 Nanchang Road, Wusong, recently purchased several pieces of scrap iron from Bao Rongquan, a scrap dealer. Among them was a mortar shell. The mortar shell was left over from the January 28th Incident. At that time, the shop assistants did not know it was a dangerous item. At about 3:30 pm yesterday, they hit the shell hard with a hammer. Unexpectedly, although the outside of the shell was rusty, the explosive inside had not disappeared. It exploded at that time with a loud noise that could be heard far and wide. It is estimated that six men and women were injured in the explosion, including Lu Xicheng, Yang Fulang, Xu Baosheng, Jin Xingquan, Li Changlin, and Pan Liu. The post police reported to the Wusong Police Station. After police officers Yang Haitian and Inspector Zhu Bingzhao went to investigate the circumstances of the incident, they sent the injured men and women to the Wusong Health Office for treatment and detained Jin Dongsheng, a shop assistant, and Bao Rongquan, a scrap dealer, to inquire about the source of the shell. It is reported that among the six injured, Lu Xicheng had his abdomen blown open and was the most seriously injured. The other five had their hands and feet blown up, but there was no danger to their lives.</p>

<p>At 11:50 pm the night before last, four robbers wearing blue cloth shirts and pants and speaking with a Jiangbei accent suddenly came to the Yixintang Hotel at No. 323, Tailaomiao Road, Gonghe New Road, Zhabei, which was opened by Xiong Jichen. Three robbers entered, and one robber was guarding the door. While robbing, someone ran to report to the No. 31 post policeman Yang Shichao of the nearby Zhongxing Road Police Station, claiming that there was a fire in the Yixintang Hotel. The policeman believed it to be true and rushed to the hotel, seeing a person standing at the door with no fire. Suspecting that the person was the arsonist, he was about to arrest him when three robbers rushed out of the hotel, each holding a handgun. They grabbed the policeman and said, "Friends, please help," snatched the policeman's handgun (containing six bullets), fired two shots, and fled. It is also reported that the hotel was only robbed of 2,700 copper coins and four dimes. The robbers were about to go upstairs, but because the policeman had arrived, they did not have time to go upstairs to rob.</p>

<p>Lu, the wife of Ye Chongliang, a tea shop worker, lived at No. 1223, Yongqingli, Roberts Road. She was thirty years old, from Suzhou, and had two children, one thirteen years old and the other three years old. Recently, she became pregnant again, about four months along, and was suffering from an illness that she could not tolerate. She discussed it with her neighbor, Zhang Fang, a woman from Ningbo, who introduced her to Zhang Lou, an old woman living at No. 1294, Gexiebang, who worked at home. On the afternoon of the 17th of this month, at about 6:00 pm, she came to the house to perform an abortion, inserting a grass root into her vulva. By 5:00 pm that night, the fetus was aborted. The next day at noon, the old woman went to Mrs. Lu's house, and Mrs. Lu gave her a two-dollar reward. Mrs. Lu suffered severe abdominal pain, and by 12:00 am on the 19th, the pain worsened. Her husband sent her to Guangren Hospital, where the treatment was ineffective, and she died on the morning of the previous day. The hospital found that she had developed peritonitis due to the abortion and reported it by telephone to the Putuo Road Patrol Room. The patrol dispatched detectives to investigate and arrested Zhang Fang and Zhang Lou. The body of Ye Lu was taken to the Fei Lun Road mortuary for an autopsy. Yesterday morning, the patrol sent the two women to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the patrol's lawyer, charged Zhang Lou with Article 290 of the Criminal Law and Zhang Fang with Article 292 of the Criminal Law. Judge Liu Yu-gui interrogated Zhang Fang, who confessed that she was a neighbor of the deceased. Recently, because she was not feeling well after becoming pregnant, she repeatedly asked me to help her have an abortion. I was pregnant last year, and the child died in my womb. I called Zhang Lou to come and remove it for me. Only then did I know that the old woman could perform abortions, and I introduced her to the deceased. Zhang Lou confessed that she worked in a cigarette factory and admitted to performing an abortion on Mrs. Lu. She did not know the name of the herb. After questioning, Judge Liu adjourned the hearing for a later date. Zhang Fang was allowed to be released on bail, and Zhang Lou was detained. At about 10:00 am, Prosecutor Tang of the First Court came to the mortuary to conduct an autopsy. After confirming that the deceased Ye Lu was indeed a woman who had died from an abortion, he ordered her husband Ye Chongliang to sign a guarantee and take the body back for burial.</p>

<p>Xu Xueseng, the former magistrate of Zhangye County, Gansu Province, resided at No. 9, Dongming Deli, Malang Road, French Concession, Shanghai. At about 5:00 pm on the 6th of last month, he was with friends Dong Ronggen and Chuan Jichun when he was bathing at the Xinxin Pool on Bai Er Road. While leaving the pool, as they were walking down Wangzhi Road, a thug, arrived in a car, and sprayed sulphuric acid on his face from the bottled acid he was holding. Xu was unable to dodge and his face was burned by the sulphuric acid. Fortunately, Xu's companions came forward and apprehended the assailant. At the time, the assailant panicked and splashed the sulfuric acid on his own face. Then, the patrolmen arrived and took the assailant to the patrol room. The assailant confessed that his name was Gao Jinsheng, 25 years old, from Changshu, and lived at No. 19 Lanwei Ai Road. He was sent to the Second Special Court. Gao initially confessed that it was at the instruction of Little Mao, who was on the run. Subsequently, he changed his statement, claiming that it was accidental and that he poured the acid on the plaintiff's face without anyone instigating him. After the debate was concluded, the judgment was announced yesterday morning. The motion on Gao was based on the court president Wang Gangxu determining Gao Jinsheng guilty of causing serious injury to others and sentenced him to four years of imprisonment.</p>

He fled to Suzhou and hid in Room 18 of the Daxingtai Hotel in Changmen. After the incident, he was arrested by the Public Security Bureau and found to have a Shanghai China General Chamber of Commerce Bank savings passbook with 400 yuan, 285 yuan in legal tender, and some jewelry, which was sent to the Local Court for detention. The day before yesterday, detectives Jian Chunshu and Wu Junqing of the Yulin Road Patrol Room learned of this and went to Suzhou with a letter from the First Special District Court to bring the apprentice Cai back to Shanghai. He was taken into custody in the patrol room. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court. Lawyer Zhu of the Bureau of Public Works, stated the facts and claimed that the owner of the Dechang Pawnshop, Weng Xuchen, suspected that Cai had started the fire when he was at the patrol room, but Cai denied it. He is now being prosecuted for theft. He also presented the seized evidence for inspection. Please investigate. Weng Xuchen also claimed that more than 400 yuan worth of jewelry was missing and that the apprentice Cai had been with him for a year and a half. The defendant admitted to stealing the items and selling the gold jewelry to various silver shops in the French Concession, and the rest was used for spending. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered that he be held for sentencing on a scheduled date.</p>

<h3 id="e137">One Collision Causes Harm to Three Ships: Lushan Collides with Haiyun, Damages Nanyang, Songshan, and a Barge, Resulting in Significant Losses – Incident Occurs in Front of Yangjiadu <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Haiyun, a ship belonging to the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, arriving in Shanghai from Lianyungang, was struck by the Lushan, a ship belonging to the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha company, upon reaching the dock. The impact also affected the Nanyang and Songshan vessels, and a barge was crushed, resulting in substantial damage. This newspaper's reporter, upon learning of the incident, went to investigate the situation and will present the details below:</p>
<p>Haiyun Turns Around: The Haiyun, formerly the French ship "D'Artagnan" purchased by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, is dedicated to transporting freight from the Longhai Railway to the port of Lianyungang. This time, the Haiyun arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 20th (the day before yesterday), at approximately 10:00 AM. The Haiyun entered Wusong, heading for the Yangjiadu pier in Pudong to unload cargo. The Yangjiadu pier is connected to the Nisshin pier in Pudong. When the Haiyun vessel reached Yangjiadu, it usually turned around before docking. At that time, the river surface was turbulent with strong winds and tides. Captain Huang Hongqian turned the ship around on the river surface. Normally, the ship channel faces towards Pudong when turning. However, the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha's Lushan vessel,</p>
<p>Disregards the River Surface: Ignoring that a ship was turning around on the river, it undocked from the Nisshin pier. It was heading to Fuzhou and Guangdong. When the Lushan left the dock, the stern was facing out from the dock, backing out onto the river surface before heading off. As the stern of the Lushan extended out, the Haiyun was in the process of turning around. Seeing this situation, Captain Huang was alarmed, fearing a major disaster. He quickly changed the Haiyun's ship channel to turn west, hoping to avoid a severe collision. Unfortunately, the Japanese vessel did not stop at this time, possibly because it was too late. As a result, the stern of the Lushan collided with the port side of the Haiyun,</p>
<p>Mid-cabin Collision: Causing damage to the iron plates of the Haiyun's port side mid-cabin. The stern of the Lushan also suffered significant damage due to the excessive recoil. At this point, the hull of the Lushan had not fully left the dock. In front of this vessel were the Songshan and Nanyang vessels. The rear of the Lushan struck the Nanyang. The impact broke the mooring cables, causing the Nanyang to also experience extreme turbulence. It first violently struck a barge that was outside the hull,</p>
<p>Crushed Under the Hull: Causing significant damage. Another barge that was also next to the hull was also damaged. The Songshan vessel was moored at the bow and stern of the Nanyang vessel. It had already loaded its cargo and was carrying passengers, ready to sail to various ports in Northern China. Unexpectedly, after being struck by the Nanyang, the iron anchor of its bow went towards the rear of the Songshan,</p>
<p>Nanyang Breaks Through: Fortunately, the damaged area and the damage to the rear of the Lushan were both above the cargo line, and did not significantly affect navigation. However, both vessels were eager to depart, so they could not stay in Shanghai for long. At the time, the captain reported the incident to Nisshin Kisen Kaisha. Captain Huang Hongqian of the Haiyun also reported the incident to the General Bureau. Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, upon receiving the report, immediately requested that impartial personnel inspect the damage to both vessels, estimate all losses, and prepare to negotiate with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. They also instructed the Lushan and Songshan to depart after inspection, with the damaged areas temporarily repaired. Major repairs would be done upon their return to Shanghai. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company also sent Engineer Zhang to</p>
<p>Inspect the Haiyun: And inquire about the cause of the collision. Engineer Zhang also inspected the situation on both Japanese vessels. The responsibility for this collision lies entirely with the Japanese vessel Lushan, for not considering the presence of a ship in the Huangpu River when setting sail, resulting in this disaster. The Haiyun is not at fault. Yesterday afternoon, the incident was reported to the Navigation Administration Bureau and the insurance company was notified. The insurance company will send personnel to reinspect the case. The issue of responsibility will be negotiated by both parties. The Haiyun suffered minor damage and can still sail to Haizhou Lianyungang this morning. As for the damaged barge, Nisshin will handle the matter. This collision, which damaged two vessels and destroyed a barge, resulted in very significant losses.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Wheeler Speaks on Slaughterhouses: Lecture Given Yesterday at the Lester Institute of Technology <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Institute of Engineers held a meeting yesterday at the Lester Institute of Technology, where Wheeler, a technician from the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, gave a lecture on the Council's plans and equipment for establishing slaughterhouses. He stated that the design of modern slaughterhouses requires careful consideration. For example, when the Municipal Council established a slaughterhouse in this city, it sought the opinions of various experts in order to achieve perfection and provide the residents of this city with a modern, scientific slaughterhouse that could provide ample meat. The establishment of slaughterhouses is entirely due to the large urban population and the demand for high-quality meat products, rather than the meaning of slaughtering animals in a humane manner. After the establishment of slaughterhouses, the benefits include lower meat prices, concentrated livestock, convenient veterinary inspections, the ability to improve breeding through the study of animal diseases, and the promotion of legislation to protect public health. Dead animals can be disinfected and sold for other uses, avoiding waste. In some countries, hygiene is not considered when raising livestock, and the quality of meat is not considered. These types of livestock only have the opportunity to be inspected after being transported to slaughterhouses. Purchasers can see whether there is a slaughterhouse inspection stamp and know what to choose. During the lecture, a video on the equipment and slaughtering process of slaughterhouses was shown, providing a reference for engineering professionals. Members of the association are scheduled to visit the Municipal Council's slaughterhouse on Saturday.</p>

<p>There are many overseas Chinese on Mindanao Island in the Philippines, all of whom care about their motherland. When the National Government issued aviation and highway construction lotteries, Wang Yiji of the Zhongxing Bank on Sichuan Road in this city was appointed as the agent to promote the lotteries among overseas Chinese starting from the first issue in the 22nd year. A large number of lottery tickets have been sold over the years. The first prize of the 21st issue, number 081945, was purchased from Wang Yiji and resold to Mindanao Island. It is said that a foreman named Xu from a rubber factory on the island purchased the entire sheet and then sold six of the tickets to workers from the same factory, including Zhang and Lu, and many other small workers. Xu himself kept four tickets. After the lottery drawing, it was revealed that he had won the first prize. The workers in the entire factory were overjoyed. The news spread, and the overseas Chinese were all moved to tell each other. As a result, sales of lottery tickets in that area for the 22nd issue increased dramatically.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Bazizhao Police Station of the North Station Branch received a tip that the robbers involved in the recent robberies of guns from the Pengpu District Defense Corps and the police officers on Zhongxing Road near the Bazizhao Police Station were meeting on the upper floor of the Sande Tea House at 330 Zhongshan Road, planning further criminal activities. Upon receiving the information, the police station immediately dispatched Inspector Li Jinrong, Sergeant Chuan Yongkang, police officers Han Pingzhou and Qi Wenbin, and more than ten detectives to secretly surround the location. After being identified by an informant, the police detectives issued an order and apprehended the four robbers who were drinking tea. A 4-inch pistol and four bullets were found on one of the robbers. Unexpectedly, two other robbers sitting at a nearby table fled downstairs upon seeing their accomplices being captured. The police detectives noticed this and immediately went downstairs in pursuit. The two robbers desperately fled into the wilderness to hide. Seeing that the police detectives were closing in, they opened fire to resist arrest while running. Gunshots were heard continuously. However, due to the darkness and the wilderness, the two robbers managed to escape. Afterwards, the area was searched, and another 4-inch pistol and two bullets abandoned by the robbers were found. The four captured robbers were taken back to the police station. After interrogation, they identified themselves as Dong Jingzhai, 30 years old, Xiao Fulong, 28 years old, and Qi Defu, 34 years old, all from Jinan, and Wang Huanting, from Fengtian, 33 years old. The pistol and bullets were found on Xiao Fulong, who claimed that the weapons were supplied by someone else. They confessed to the numerous gun robbery cases. When asked about the names of the masterminds, they claimed that one was Li Shouheng from Jinan, residing at 3 Zhonghua Fang, Zhonghua New Road, and the other was Zhao Debiao from Tancheng, 27 years old, residing at 6 Xiangshan Lane, Yanjiage Road. All the weapons and criminal plans were directed by these two individuals. The two who resisted arrest in the wilderness were also these two, they said. After receiving the confession, the police station immediately dispatched detectives to secretly arrest them. However, Li Shouheng had already fled. It was not until approximately 10:30 PM that Zhao Debiao and his mistress, Bu Sanyuan, a local resident aged 29, were captured in Xiangshan Lane. After being taken to the police station for interrogation, Zhao claimed to be working as a gatekeeper at Tianyun Paradise, and remained evasive. Bu Sanyuan claimed that she had only recently become acquainted with Zhao. She worked as a female tea server in the Shenqu theater at the Paradise and did not know much about Zhao's activities. The police station then handed over the captured criminals, along with the guns and bullets, to the General Bureau for further investigation. In the meantime, they continued to dispatch detectives to pursue Li Shouheng and bring him to justice. At the same time, a man from Jiangbei named Wang Yongfu, 25 years old, was struck by five bullets while the robbers were being arrested and fell in the wilderness. He was subsequently found by the police officers, who took him to the hospital for treatment. He suffered one gunshot wound to the neck and four to his legs. The injured man claimed to be a tailor and was unable to avoid the gunfire. However, according to the police station's investigation, the man was injured in the wilderness. At the time of the shootout between the police and the robbers, there were no other people walking around, so it is difficult to immediately determine whether he was a robber or a civilian. A fortune teller has been consulted.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Shooting Case on Route Doumer: Shanghai Police Arrest Two Key Suspects <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>—Various Parties Maintain Strict Secrecy and Refuse to Announce Details—</p>
<p>An Outer News Agency reported in the Continental Daily that two Chinese men, said to be directly related to the shooting of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo on Route Doumer on November 9th last year, were brought to the First Special District Court yesterday for a brief hearing. They were then returned to the Central Police Station for custody under strict guard.</p>
<p>The interrogation was conducted in extreme secrecy. The only attendees were a small number of police officers directly involved in the case. A reporter from the Continental Daily witnessed the two suspects being taken to the court, but despite his best efforts to inquire about the details of the case, he was unable to obtain any information. According to reports, the Legal Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council informed reporters that they had received instructions not to disclose any information about the case. However, it has now been confirmed that the two men were arrested in connection with the Nakayama Hideo shooting case and are believed to be directly involved in the shooting.</p>
<p>According to a reliable source, one of the two men was arrested in Tianjin last week and was immediately extradited to Shanghai. The other was arrested yesterday morning by the detectives of the Route des Soeurs Police Station.</p>
<p>Japanese officials are also maintaining the same secrecy regarding the matter. However, given that the arrest of the two men has already been made, it seems undeniable. It is said that the two men were taken to the Central Police Station yesterday morning for temporary detention, and then taken to the court for interrogation in the afternoon.</p>
<p>What is strange is that most of the personnel at the Central Police Station are unaware of this matter. Those who know about it are also maintaining secrecy and refuse to disclose any information.</p>
<p>The case of the shooting of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo occurred on November 9th last year. The authorities offered a reward of 1,000 yuan for the capture of the murderer.</p>

<p>Industrial Therapy</p>
<p>Those who attended the meeting yesterday included Dr. Eli, a representative of the Lester Institute of Medical Research, and directors Clark, Pang Die, Bullock Hall, Luo Chen, Jian Ji, Glen 克孫, Municipal Council Director Arnold, Guo Shun, Director of the Department of Health Qiao Dou, and over 50 Chinese and foreign donors.

Mrs. Su Yanzhen has recently been in charge of industrial therapy at the hospital, which is suitable for patients with lung disease, surgical disease, neurological disease, and chronic diseases who are gradually recovering and will soon be discharged from the hospital. The treatment method involves patients working for about one hour a day, performing light industrial handicrafts in which they excel, such as knitting wool clothing, weaving rattan handbags, and student satchels. Yesterday, all of these items were displayed on the table. According to Mrs. Su, this treatment emphasizes the use of bright colors and unique methods to make patients happy in mind and body through work, forgetting their illnesses. Xiehe Hospital in Beiping has a large-scale treatment program that provides significant psychological comfort to patients, reducing their symptoms. It has only been two months since the trial implementation at this hospital, so it is too early to say what the results will be. The cost of various handicrafts is 50 to 60 yuan, and they are sold at cost. The products were displayed on the table yesterday, with over 20 items, large and small, creating a miniature handicraft exhibition. The ladies who attended the meeting purchased them as souvenirs.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Zhong Yuliang Requests Correction of Unauthorized Excavation of Abandoned Graves <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The practice of grave robbing has been prevalent in the four rural areas of this city, especially in Gaoqiao in Pudong. Now, former Municipal Councilor Zhong Yuliang of the district has submitted a case to the Farmers' Association. The case proposes that Yin [surname only] is encroaching on the official river and instructing the excavation of abandoned graves, requesting that the situation be corrected. The Qingpu River is a major river in our rural area. Due to the large scale of the project, it has been silted up for decades and impossible to dredge. In the past, the joint efforts of the three counties of Baoshan and Chuansha were required to dredge it. All of us villagers should cherish it and avoid clogging it up. However, Yin has privately filled in the Qingpu River behind his residence, encroaching on more than two zhang (during the river dredging, large trees were used as boundaries, and the current trees are over two zhang from [what is considered the original location], and there is a public land of one zhang to the west of the trees, which can be proven by the Qing Dynasty survey map). Yin also slightly expanded on the east bank, hoping to deceive the public. As a result, the straight river has become a back-bow shape. The surrounding area is silted up, making it difficult for boats to travel and water to flow smoothly, harming merchants, travelers, and farmers. There have been consecutive years of crop failure, with far-reaching impacts. In addition, there is a grave robbing problem in our hometown. When Yuliang was a Municipal Councilor, he submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Government for a public ban, which was approved. Now, Yin is instructing the excavation of ownerless graves in order to buy grave bricks and stones for building family shrines and viewing platforms. The foundations of the platforms were originally abandoned graves, which have now been almost completely occupied and excavated. More than ten other abandoned graves have been destroyed in the four rural areas, and the buying continues. As a result, even graves with owners have been excavated. Encroaching on the official river and instructing the excavation of abandoned graves both involve violating the law. Yuliang has repeatedly advised Yin in person, but to no avail. He sent a letter of sincere advice, which was also ignored. The Qingpu River is related to the water conservancy of the entire township, and grave robbing is related to customs and traditions. Therefore, I dare to recount the circumstances and request that your association correct the situation, order Yin to restore the Qingpu River to its original state, order him to stop buying abandoned grave bricks and stones, and demolish the foundations of the occupied abandoned graves, so as to set an example for others. Whether this is appropriate, please make a public decision. Respectfully submitted by proponent Zhong Yuliang.</p>

<p>Lawyer Luo Hanzhen (style name Jiaxuan), a native of Dexian County, Shandong Province, has been practicing in Liaoning. Last March, he joined the Shanghai Bar Association as a member and resides at No. 7 Tongchunfang, Baker Road. Recently, Luo Hanzhen and a local man named Chen Peide were jointly prosecuted by the Public Security Bureau to the First Special Court for defrauding a local woman, Wang, of 500 yuan of deposits, violating Article 339 of the Criminal Law. This morning, Judge Ye Shengchao held a trial in the Second Criminal Court. The defendant Chen Peide was not present because his address was unknown and he could not be summoned. Only Luo Hanzhen complied with the summons to appear in court.</p>
<p>The victim, Wang, hired Lawyer Feng Song to appear in court and filed a civil suit as an attachment. Qian Xunjiu, the lawyer of the Public Security Bureau, rose to state the case, saying that at 10:50 AM on the 9th of this month, the Public Security Bureau received a phone report saying that a robbery had occurred at No. 7 Tongchunfang, Baker Road. The Public Security Bureau sent Chinese detective Yin Zhanqing and a Western detective to investigate. It was learned that the place was the residence of the defendant Luo Hanzhen, and there was no robbery. Only the victim Wang and her son Wang Lianwen had a civil dispute. Wang Lianwen paid the China National Products Bank</p>
<p>A thousand yuan passbook</p>
<p>Wang wanted to withdraw the deposit, but the seal was kept by her son, who refused to hand it over. Wang then, through the introduction of hooligan Jiao Fakui, hired defendant Luo Hanzhen to sue her son in the civil court of the local court, asking him to pay 1,000 yuan for alimony. After the court session, because Wang Lianwen did not arrive, the hearing was ordered to be postponed. On March 28, Luo Hanzhen opened a room in Room 101 of the Tianran Hotel on Zhifu Road and invited Wang to talk. Unexpectedly, at 3:00 AM, Wang Lianwen was also invited by his friend Yao Miaofu to</p>
<p>Natural Hotel</p>
<p>Enter Room 108. At that time, there were already seven or eight people in the room, including Lawyer Luo. Jiao Fakui wanted to drag Wang Lianwen to the Public Security Bureau, so Wang Lianwen handed a seal to Yao for temporary safekeeping, and then went to the Public Security Bureau together. After investigation by the detectives, it was determined that it was a civil dispute and they refused to accept the case. On April 2, Lawyer Luo invited Wang to his office, saying that her son's seal had been obtained and that she could go to the bank to collect the money. Luo and Wang and Chen Peide then carried</p>
<p>Passbook Round Seal</p>
<p>And the insurance policy, went to the National Products Bank and asked Wang to wait at the door. Luo went inside and came out after two hours. According to him, the money was not received. Later, Wang and her son Wang Lianwen reconciled, so on April 9, they went to Lawyer Luo's office to ask for the passbook and seal, which caused a dispute. Lawyer Luo accused the Wang mother and son of robbing a receipt for 1,000 yuan. Luo's wife reported the robbery to the Public Security Bureau by phone. After the Chinese and Western detectives learned the details, they went to the National Products Bank to investigate. It was said that the deposit of 1,000 yuan had been withdrawn by Chen Peide on April 1 and transferred to the Ningbo Road Zhengming Bank. The detectives then went to</p>
<p>Certificate Inquiry</p>
<p>It is true that there is a deposit of 1,000 yuan in Wang's name, but Chen Peide withdrew 750 yuan by two decisions. Therefore, the Public Security Bureau believes that Lawyer Luo and Chen Peide have colluded in fraud and filed a lawsuit against Jun Ruan. Wang also confessed the details, saying that Jiao Fakui had returned 500 yuan in installments, and Luo had taken the remaining 500 yuan. When asked, Luo Hanzhen admitted that he had collected a bank draft of 1,000 yuan on behalf of Wang and had handed it over to Wang, who issued a receipt. On April 9, Wang and her son came with many people and stole the receipt. I have filed a separate lawsuit, and I don't know about the rest. Judge Ye said that the case still needs to be investigated, so he ordered a rescheduling for further questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Details of the Sudden Death of the Giant Elephant in the Municipal Zoo – Colleagues in the Zoo Express Deep Sorrow <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The news of the sudden death of a giant elephant in the Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road due to electric shock has been briefly reported. However, the cause of death is not clear. The Datong News Agency reporter learned from the zoo that the gray elephant was purchased in the 23rd year of the Republic of China and transported to Shanghai in July of that year. It was put on display in the park at a cost of 2,800 yuan. The zoo immediately purchased the base in the southwest corner of the park adjacent to the park and built an elephant house, intending to ensure the safety of the giant elephant's life. Because elephants like heat and have a huge body, the materials of the elephant house are all made of steel and cement. There is an open space in front of the house, a swimming pool, and two wall-mounted stoves in the house. The cleanliness and health of the elephant are fully considered. Recently, spherical parasites were found on the skin of the elephant. After rigorous treatment, it has not yet recovered. Suddenly, on the 19th of the month, it jumped violently in the middle of the night, destroyed the door lock, and died of electric shock. The colleagues in the park usually work carefully, but unexpectedly the elephant died suddenly and unexpectedly. They were unable to rescue it and were all extremely sad.</p>

<p>Dear Sir, I recently read a report in your newspaper's local news section about a conflict between the incense workshop workers in Zhabei and the security team. The content is inconsistent with the facts. The incense workers' strike was very painful because Dayuan Shipping arbitrarily reduced wages. During the strike period, it was inevitable that bad elements would mix in. The association specially sent inspectors to maintain order among the workers in four directions. Only four inspectors were sent to the area. The security team leader Li Huaizhang (also known as Li San) was not wearing military uniform that day and interfered arbitrarily. In a verbal conflict, he gathered people to beat the four inspectors of the association, and also detained the regiment headquarters. At that time, no White Langlin pistol was seen, and there was no incident of injuring neighboring women. In addition to filing a lawsuit in accordance with the law, we have sent a letter to you, hoping that you will publish a correction.

<h3 id="e160">The Insurance Industry in Shanghai <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Chief Editor of China WeChat</p>
<p>(General Conditions of Industry and Commerce in Shanghai, No. 23)</p>
<p>1.  The Evolution of the Insurance Industry in Shanghai</p>
<p>The pioneers of the insurance industry in Shanghai were undoubtedly the British firms, Yongfu and Small Eastern. These two companies were established in 1836. At that time, their scale was very small, and the Chinese people did not understand the nature and significance of insurance. Therefore, most of the insured were foreigners. In 1885, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company established the Renjihe Insurance Company, which marked the beginning of our country's engagement in fire and marine insurance. From 1888 to 1900, Yongfu Company compiled a Chinese mortality experience table and began to underwrite Chinese life insurance. Subsequently, American companies such as New York Life Insurance Co. and The Equitable Life Ins. Co. of New York established branches in China. In 1899, the China Yongnian Life Insurance Company was established, marking the beginning of Chinese involvement in life insurance. Thereafter, the number of foreign fire and marine insurance branches established in Shanghai was innumerable. After 1905, Chinese insurance companies began to flourish, including companies such as Hezong, Huaan, Huaxing, Huacheng, Wanfeng, and Fuan. In 1905, the Shanghai Insurance Association was established. At this time, Chinese insurance companies had gradually grown in scale. Subsequently, companies such as Huaan Hequn Insurance Company, Yongning Insurance Firm, the Insurance Department of the Central Trust Company, and the Insurance Department of the Ning Shao Merchant Shipping Company were successively established. Xianshi, Yongan and others re-established branches in Shanghai. Thus, the insurance industry in Shanghai became increasingly prosperous. In the past three years, the Shanghai financial sector has been affected by the decline of industry and commerce, the bankruptcy of rural areas, and the concentration of capital in cities. It has also competed to invest its surplus capital in insurance, resulting in significant progress. Not only have new companies (such as Taiping Tianyi, etc.) been established one after another, but the strong capital of Japanese companies, far surpassing others, is also a special phenomenon in today's overall economic downturn.</p>
<p>2.  The Current Situation of Insurance in Shanghai</p>
<p>1. A Comparison of the Number of Chinese and Foreign Merchants</p>
<p>Currently, in terms of the number of insurance companies in Shanghai, there are more than 140 foreign companies and only 26 Chinese companies, with two Sino-foreign joint ventures. In terms of capital, the paid-up capital of Chinese companies, including branches, totals more than 25 million yuan. Although 80% of foreign companies are agency-based, their capital figures are difficult to calculate temporarily. However, the capital of the American Insurance Association alone reaches more than 136.4 million US dollars. The meager capital of Chinese merchants is indeed vastly different from that of foreign merchants.</p>
<p>2. An Overview of Insurance Companies from Various Countries in Shanghai</p>
<p>Among the foreign insurance companies in Shanghai, the British have the largest influence, followed by the Americans. There are very few French and Japanese insurance companies. The influence of German, Italian, Swiss, Austrian, and other nationalities is even weaker. A detailed description follows:</p>

<p>B. American Merchants: Among American insurance companies, American Foreign Insurance Association, Insurance Company of North America, and AmericaAsiatic Unjerwrite, Fed, Inc, U.S.A have the largest scope. A detailed description of their contents follows:</p>
<p>1. American Foreign Insurance Association. The head office is located at 80 Maiden Lane, New York, USA. The Shanghai branch is located at 51 Guangdong Road.

It underwrites various types of insurance and acts as an agent for as many as 26 insurance companies. Its annual premium income reaches 3 million yuan, but it decreased to more than 810,000 yuan in the previous year.

<p>In terms of investment, the company holds shares in American Asiatic Life Insurance Company, accounting for 25,000 shares out of its total of 40,000 shares. It invests in French American Insurance Company, accounting for half of its assets. In addition, it is a shareholder of Sihai Insurance Company. It can be called a giant among insurance agencies in Shanghai. However, since the liquidation of American Asiatic Bank, the company's investment of 183,000 yuan in the bank has been lost, and its financial strength has inevitably been slightly affected.

<p>Shen Bao National Products Special Issue</p>
<h3 id="e161">National Products Market in the Capital <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Shouqiu</p>
<p>In the past two or three years, the voice of advocating national products in the capital has indeed been very high, and some people also know the importance of advocating national products. Under such circumstances, national products markets have emerged accordingly. There are a total of four national products markets in the current capital. The oldest one is the national products market in the Huaiqing Bridge National Products Exhibition Hall. The largest one is the recently opened Central Market. The situation of these four national products markets is described separately below:</p>
<p>Central Market The Central Market has only been open for two or three months. It is located on Zhongzheng Road, not far from Xinjiekou Square, and is also very close to Taiping Road, Zhongshan Road, and others, so the location is very good. The shops inside are also very complete, and there is also a Bank of China and a Central Garden, which other markets do not have. There is a Chinese restaurant upstairs: There is also a Western restaurant: There is also a barber shop. There are more than one hundred shops in the whole market. There is a United Sales Office of Shanghai National Products Factories, which are all famous factories in Shanghai, and it is the most exciting and valuable market in the whole market. The office is on the third floor. Slogans advocating national products and new life are hung on the walls and pillars in the market. Salespersons also have a badge for easy identification. Therefore, the order is indeed very orderly. To the right of the market is a Dahua Cinema, but it has not yet opened. If it opens, the business of the market will definitely be much better than it is now.</p>
<p>A special feature of this market is that the change is not based on the market rate of silver coins in Nanjing, but on the legal price stipulated by the Ministry of Finance. Because the market rate in Nanjing is that one yuan of legal tender can be exchanged for three thousand one hundred and several dozen copper coins, while in this market, it is calculated at three thousand coins per yuan, regardless of change in or out.</p>
<p>National Products Market The National Products Market of Huaiqing Bridge is affiliated with the National Products Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Industry. It has been around for about ten years in Nanjing! However, because the location is not very suitable, it seems to be at a disadvantage in terms of competition. However, a road has now been built there, and transportation is still considered convenient. In addition, the market can be pragmatic in all business operations, which is very commendable. The gate of the market is on the left side of the National Products Exhibition Hall. Probably two months ago? The market has been transferred to the management of the Nanjing Municipal Government and is no longer related to the Ministry of Industry.</p>
<p>China National Products Company Its address is next to the Central Bank on Qi Wang Street, Jiankang Road, which is also a lively location. It has been open for one year and six months, and the business is said to be very developed. Because it is run by the Nanjing Municipal Government, it naturally has some advantages in almost every aspect, but the location of the company is very small, which seems to be a fly in the ointment. However, it is indeed not easy to find a building with a large area on that road. Fortunately, the company's business will not be diminished by the small location!</p>
<p>Because the company is run by the municipal government, the quality of the goods is very good, and the price is fair, which is commendable.</p>
<p>Great China Market It seems that it has not been open for a year. Its address is the old site of the World Hotel on Taiping Road Men Zhai Bridge. In addition to the main entrance, a door is also opened in the north. Speaking of Taiping Road, it is also a lively road in Nanjing, but for some reason, the business of the market is not very good. Recently, the market held a big sale for a month, and those who bought one yuan or more were given a scholarship lottery ticket. At the same time, there were also loss leaders. Invincible Tooth Powder, three bags can be bought for one cent; Guben Soap, one piece is sold for one dime, and Double Coin brand rubber shoes are also sold for fifty-five cents, which can be said to be a truly big sacrifice! But except for the loss leaders that were bought by many people, the rest of the business is still very sluggish.</p>
<p>In addition to the four mentioned above, there is no fifth national products market in Nanjing at present. Finally, what I want to report is that the Central Market will organize an evaluation committee to prevent raising prices. Perhaps the market has heard the rumors outside! Because many people say that the prices of goods in the market are relatively expensive.</p>

<p>— Xinxiu</p>
<p>Mrs. Li is very fond of makeup. She pays special attention to her hair. Because she protects it well, her hair is always moisturized, fragrant, and her hair bun is like clouds.</p>
<p>However, although the fragrant powder, fragrant honey, and beauty cream used by Mrs. Li are all domestic products, the perfumed hair water she uses is an imported product. When someone asks her, she always says: "There have always been very few high-quality perfumed hair waters from domestic products, so I regret it and can't find any good one."</p>
<p>Recently, Mrs. Li's dressing table is filled with domestic cosmetics. It turns out that she heard that Wuzhou Pharmacy has a new perfumed hair water that is very good, so she bought it back to try it, and she was really satisfied. So she said to others: "Now that I have '131 Perfumed Hair Water', my difficult problem is solved."</p>

<p>— Yang’an</p>
<p>The Shanghai industrial circles organized a Guangdong and Guangxi Industrial Investigation Group, and it has not been long since they returned. Recently, they have launched a Nanyang Commercial Investigation Group, which is scheduled to go abroad in early July. Someone asked about the results of the Guangdong and Guangxi Industrial Investigation Group. The reporter believes that although this trip did not yield amazing results, the mutual understanding has been communicated, and the mutual barriers have been eliminated. The greatest effect is that the trade between Shanghai, Guangdong, and Guangxi will be indirect, and will become direct, and will be partial, and will become whole. It is hoped that in the shortest period of time, the Guangdong Provincial State-owned Products Management Office, Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce, and the Guangxi Import and Export Trade Management Office, and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, etc., will jointly organize with the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the China General Federation of Industry, and national products groups to establish a mutual trade bureau management organization to bear this permanent mission. The Guangdong and Guangxi authorities and Mr. Wu Tingyang all advocated that there should be such an organization, and all industrialists strongly supported it. In the near future, they may draft the organization and discuss the method, so that the trade between Guangdong, Guangxi, and Shanghai can open a new era of development, and not fail the decision of this investigation. This is what the reporter earnestly hopes and prays for. The organization of the Nanyang Commercial Investigation Group is necessary for today's foreign trade. The reporter believes that we should recruit leaders from all industries to go there in person. We should have sufficient preparations and practical contacts in advance. The time may be leisurely, and the investigation should be studied carefully. The plan of mutual contact and the plan of mutual trade are best prepared in advance and brought for research, so that they can be discussed and decided during the investigation, or can be organized on the spot, so that they can be carried out immediately after returning to Shanghai. It seems to be more effective. This is what I dare to offer before I leave.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Two Lines of Progress for National Products <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>At the current stage, there are two very clear and correct lines of progress for national products industry unfolding before us. One is to actively seek the development of overseas markets, especially to expand trade in various places in Nanyang, so as to eliminate the trade deficit and increase exports. The other is to strive to make domestic products penetrate deeply into the people, and try to promote sales to various provinces in the border areas, and form a national production and sales cooperation network.</p>
<p>In recent years, the future of our national products has been due to the hard work of the national products industry, the protection of the government, and the enthusiastic support of the entire people, which has indeed enabled the industrial sector—especially the general mechanical industry manufacturers—to lay a very solid foundation. The future work should be to earnestly develop production, expand sales, and awaken all people, so that any people in urban and rural areas and overseas Chinese have places to identify and purchase national products. Naturally, we should step up our work, work hard, and urgently need our industrial sector to determine a concrete plan to gradually make it actively realized.</p>
<p>Regarding these two lines of progress, the recent trends in the development of national products, it is worth mentioning here that in terms of promoting sales in border areas, Mr. Ma Hongkui, Chairman of Ningxia Province, came to Shanghai last week to contact national products manufacturers to hold a national products exhibition there, so that national products will progress to the northwest—after Xi'an and Lanzhou, now to Ningxia, the farthest frontier. In terms of developing overseas markets, it was recently heard that the China National Foreign Trade Association is actively preparing to organize overseas sales teams, training personnel, and studying various steps to implement new plans to first go to Nanyang for exhibitions and develop overseas markets.</p>
<p>History teaches us: "Empty words are useless, and things are important to practice." We are now only from the two lines of progress of national products—striving to develop overseas markets and promoting sales in border areas—that everyone unites and cooperates, and moves forward very bravely.</p>

<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Wang Youshang’s article “Introduction to National Products Welcomed by Foreigners” in the National Products Year, he said: He is a student at Xitai Western Food Store, specializing in trading with foreigners, and is very familiar with the promotion of national products. Based on facts, he sells more than 1,500 yuan of Mabingshan biscuits every month, 90% of which are sold to foreigners. In addition, there are also canned foods produced by Merlin, Pagoda. Butter butter produced by Daya, black tea produced by Yutai, and Five Star Beer produced by Shuanghesheng. The Chinese people only know how to buy Sullivan, Yili, and other biscuits, which is very sad (see the supplement of the Xinwen Bao on March 24). The Chinese people treat their own national products as worn-out shoes and disdain to take a look, but only admire foreign goods. Simply this kind of psychology is the psychology of national subjugation! The slave psychology is incorrigible, and one day disaster will come! Alas! Foreigners still know how to use our national products and welcome our national products, but the Chinese people are assimilating with foreigners, which is a shameful phenomenon that has never existed in various countries in the world! I hope that the Chinese people will correct it if they have it, and encourage it if they don't have it! Don't make foreigners laugh, but deeply reflect on yourselves!</p>

<p>In our daily diet, after eating vegetables for too long, we feel that the taste of meat is rich and beautiful. After eating fish and meat, we feel bored, and we feel that vegetables are fresh and tender. In life adjustment, all things should be viewed in this way.</p>
<p>Bridges are easy to fall from when they are high, and roads are difficult to run when they are far. Those in the mountains do not know the height of the mountains, and those on the peaks do not know the danger of the peaks. Breaking through difficulties and advancing bravely, the Himalayas are high, but they cannot hinder the feet of explorers.</p>
<p>Modern people do things like old women reading scriptures, only seeking to read them fluently, not seeking their meaning. Giving weight to quantity and not quality is a common problem of modern human beings.</p>
<p>When young people study, it is better to study how to use living words than to turn over dead dictionaries, and it is better to read ancient and modern books than to write articles indiscriminately.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Random Talk on Science <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>Modern new inventions in science are one after another for us to enjoy. What a happy thing this is? But when we sit back and enjoy these scientific inventions, how should we commemorate the scientists who invented these things?</p>
<p>Every scientist who invents something is definitely not just a matter of one stroke of the hand to succeed. History tells us that some scientists have spent years or decades, or even their entire lives, in test tubes, microscopes, or other scientific instruments. Moreover, there are also some who have studied for a lifetime and have not succeeded, and leave the unfinished work to the deceased, or to the scientists of the next generation to study and invent. This kind of research spirit seems to be somewhat foolish, because for the sake of spending a lifetime of energy, even if there is an invention, but by the time of the invention, oneself is already gray-haired and dim-sighted, and in reality, one can no longer enjoy it. To make oneself suffer and create others, wouldn't that be the number one fool in the world? But scientists don't think so. They only know that there is science, and they are willing to coexist and die with science, and finally evolve our world to today's material civilization.</p>
<p>For example, without using a fire drill, we can use matches to make fire. Without lighting a fire, we can use electric lights to get light. How convenient is this? With a seemingly very simple radio, you can receive sounds broadcast from every corner of the earth from the air. It seems that all sounds are emitted in the small room. How magical is that? It is said that in recent years, wireless telegraphy has also achieved considerable success, which is even more mysterious. We can only marvel at the greatness of science. To say it again, Wanshan Wanli can shorten the journey with trains and cars. The vast ocean can be reached on time by giant ships that ride the wind and waves. That's already quite something. Now, the rising star of airplanes, like flying birds, can reach everywhere, and the journey of thousands of miles can be reached in the morning and evening. Great science, it's really amazing.</p>
<p>But in these years, although science is so developed, there are still many things in front of us, waiting for humans to invent. Such as the prevention of natural disasters, the treatment of diseases, and even interplanetary traffic, etc., in the next few centuries, scientists who benefit humankind are needed for their efforts. Naturally, our descendants may be several times happier than us in terms of the material enjoyment of science.</p>

<p>— Li Guang</p>
<p>A few days ago, I happened to read Mr. Taofen's "Recollections of Drifting Footprints," in which there was a passage that said:</p>
<p>Once, an American middle-aged woman brought her young daughter to travel to England. Introduced by a friend, she rented a room from the family I was staying with, saying she would stay for a week. After she and her daughter moved in, I was busy with work, leaving early and returning late, so I hadn't met them. That evening, the landlady casually talked to her about me, praising me profusely. When the American woman heard that there was a "Chinaman" living in the house, even though she had never met or spoken to me, she resolutely said to the landlady, "I can't live in the same house as a 'Chinaman'!" The next morning, she hurriedly moved out. The landlady was secretly surprised, wondering why "Chinaman" made people avoid him like a venomous snake, causing people to hate him so much!</p>
<p>It is no secret that Westerners look down on us descendants of the Yellow Emperor. But it is not as extreme as the American woman's contempt and disgust. Perhaps Mr. Taofen intended to inspire the awakening of the Chinese people, and I dare not fully believe that such a thing actually happened.</p>
<p>One day, I was walking alone in the park and caught sight of an amah leading a little Western child, sitting on a recliner under a shady tree to rest. Suddenly, a woman with a yellow face also brought a child (but this child was not Western) and walked to the tree, sitting on the other end of the recliner. The little Western child immediately pulled a face, opened his small mouth, and said in a scolding tone: "Get away! You can't sit here with me!" The amah then acted as a translator for her young master, saying to the woman: "He doesn't like you sitting here with him, please go away!" The woman had no choice but to walk away resentfully.</p>
<p>At that time, when I saw this situation, I was saddened for a long time. How could a mere child be so arrogant? This is enough to confirm the complete truth of Mr. Taofen's words.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 1: Sipping Tea and Engaging in Idle Chat by a Night Window Listening to the Rain, Startled by Beauty in a Flower-Filled Lane</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, the revolutionary army had just stabilized Jiangnan. The national calendar had not yet been adopted by society. The people still followed the customs that had been passed down for thousands of years, celebrating the old lunar year. Although Nanjing was a large city in Jiangnan, its people were no less conservative than those in any inland city. Around the Lantern Festival in the first month, bright red "Welcoming Spring" posters still adorned the walls of people's homes. In the rainy and gloomy alleys, the double doors of houses were tightly closed between the walls on either side, with the red spring couplets displayed straightly to passersby, fully expressing the festive atmosphere. The sky was about to darken, and a young man of nearly twenty, wearing a gray cotton robe and a peaked cap, came into the alley, carrying a bag in his left hand and holding a blue cloth umbrella in his right. The sound of his leather shoes walking on the cobblestones on the ground was not very loud, suggesting that he was walking slowly and lightly. He stopped at a black wooden door and knocked on the door knocker a few times. The door opened, and a middle-aged woman came out. When she saw the young man, a smile immediately spread across her worried face. She asked, "You're back very late today, are your studies even busier?" The young man simply called out "Mom" and, while putting away his umbrella, asked, "Isn't Aunt Liu at home? Why did you come to open the door yourself?" The old lady said, "Aunt Liu's contract is up, I let her go back." As she spoke, she closed the door and led her son inside. The structure of houses in cities was generally the same, in a long, linear style. Large houses had one courtyard leading into another, up to six or seven courtyards. Smaller houses had two courtyards, or one and a half. The mother and son lived in the front courtyard, a small three-room space with a brick and stone patio. The patio was not small, with half a flower bed on which grew a clump of nandina and a small tree with a bent trunk. Because it was early spring, it was not yet clear what kind of tree it was. But these two things showed that this family did not have a vulgar air. From the living room on the left, a room led directly to the wing room next to the patio, forming a long study. The young man put his umbrella outside and walked into the room. His mother carried a kerosene lamp and followed him in. The young man exclaimed, took the lamp with both hands, and said with a smile, "Mom, why are you serving me? You shouldn't have dismissed Aunt Liu. She was also very careful in her work." The old lady said, "I didn't dismiss her because she didn't do her job well. I was thinking that if you're not home, and it's just me, I can do all the trivial things myself, so why hire someone? Although the wages saved are limited, a worker's food and drink are considerable each month. Not having this person can save several dollars each month."</p>

<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Strings of red firecrackers stretched from one house to another. Bars, dance halls, cafes, hotels... these places of intoxication and enjoyment were densely packed along the short Zhu Bao San Road. During the day, it was quiet, like a typhoid patient in a coma, but at night it became restless. Alcohol, tobacco, powder... a mixture of smells, jazz music, hysterical laughter, drunken ramblings... continued until midnight, until dawn...</p>
<p>Foreign sailors wearing white cloth hats, with red, monkey-like faces, stumbled out of the white-painted glass doors, shouting boisterously. A group of rickshaws rushed forward, shouting a few broken phrases in English: "Sir, I pull you to the dock to return to warship." "I pull you to whorehouse!" However, the warrior of the civilized country got angry, raised his fist, and threw it at the rickshaw puller's neck. Then, the line of rickshaws scattered, cursing.</p>
<p>The flower girls crowded in, their hair disheveled, wearing cheap powder, unfashionable cloth cheongsams, mud-stained leather shoes, their dry hands holding a flower, trying to pin it on the sailor's collar, pinning it... entangled. The warrior of the civilized country was not angry, his face flushed with a drunken smile, he took out silver coins from his pocket and threw them into the flower girl's hand, onto the dark cement corner. Then, the flower girl smiled, seeming to celebrate the harvest of profit. But, was this really their harvest? We don't know how much profit was harvested by others. Now, they were throwing down some crumbs, were they smiling? Were they celebrating? The ignorant flower girls would not understand, for them, it was for the sake of maintaining their livelihood. And the rickshaw puller had failed.</p>
<p>The rickshaw pullers knew the fists of the civilized warriors, even the bayonets, their own blood.</p>
<p>And the second batch of foreign sailors stumbled out of the bar, the rickshaw pullers, the flower girls, the Eurasians of about ten years old crowded in. The night on Zhu Bao San Road was lively, until dawn...</p>
<h3 id="e172">Men are More Beautiful than Women <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Yi An</p>
<p>Men's appearance is more beautiful than women's, even in Hollywood, which is full of beauties. On the surface, women seem more beautiful, but the fact is not so. The reason women seem beautiful is because of makeup, hairstyle adjustments, and the colors of their clothes. The reason men seem less attractive than women is because their hair is cut uniformly, and they cannot create any hairstyles to adjust their appearance. The clothes they wear are also similar in style. If you dress women the same as men, and cut their hair like men, then they would probably be far less attractive than men. In general, men's eyebrows, eyelashes, and skin tone are better than women's, and this is due to natural talent. In a family with many children, the brothers are always more beautiful than their sisters.</p>
<p>This is the meaning of "nature," not my personal opinion. Men, like other male animals, are shaped to attract the attention of the opposite sex, while women are the ones who choose their mates. But later, because of the evolution of society, men became the masters of society, and they seized the power to choose their mates. As a result, women had to become the ones who attracted the attention of the opposite sex—look at the situation now.</p>
<p>Small Garden</p>
<h3 id="e173">The Purple Bamboo Shoots are Plump as Spring Ends <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Fan</p>
<p>Bamboo shoots are bamboo sprouts, tender and pure, with a lasting and clear taste; they are suitable for use in meals at any time of the year. Since ancient times, those who were content with poverty cultivated gardens and vegetable patches, praising vegetable roots as the greatest delicacy; they did not know that the taste of vegetables was light and not substantial, and compared to the sharp tips of the bamboo shoots emerging from the soil, they were ultimately inferior. Now, if we try to compare dishes to people, then scallions and bok choy are like reclusive guests in the mountains and forests, aloof and slightly lacking in depth. Bamboo shoots, on the other hand, are like hermits in the fields, their essence simple and unadorned, yet still retaining a secluded and cool air. As for pork and sashimi, with their round and fishy taste, they are simply like greedy merchants and inferior officials, not worth discussing. I once visited a monastery during the season when flowers were falling, begging for food from the kitchen. The fragrance floated in the air, everything mixed with the yellow tips of bamboo shoots; lingering in the intestines and tongue, I felt that there was no better taste in the world! But the monks still said apologetically: "We have little to offer our guests, please forgive our neglect!" I thought to myself that in the market, one pound cost a thousand coins, regarded as a precious delicacy, and poor families were lucky to taste them, while the monks ate them every day without any appreciation; following this reasoning, monks are always beyond this world, is it merely because the famous mountains are occupied too often? Because of this, I was envious of escaping to Chan Buddhism.</p>
<p>In the past, I stayed in Fuchun as a guest in the house of Lord Mei Fengxiao, drinking three dou of sorghum wine, letting me get drunk and chant. At that time, the reeds on the river were plump, and the forest orchids in the mountains were blooming; the old servant would dig them up with a hoe in the morning dew, picking them daily to serve as side dishes, resembling white snow lotuses. The residents here live by weaving paper, relying on bamboo rather than mulberry trees in their free time among the ten acres of land. Therefore, along the river and slopes, the bamboo grew abundantly in the clear wind, and every spring, they sprouted everywhere; bamboo shoots were to them like betel nuts to Lingnan and water shield to Xianghu, and it was much easier to obtain than fish and shrimp. And I was content with it, forgetting all other tastes. Sometimes I would sit until the spring stars faded, a thin cold mist blurred the lamp, the old servant knew I liked to drink, and would bring out leftover dregs to relieve the chill; my father, fearing the flavor of the wine was lacking, further gathered a few of the tender shoots from the hedge corner, roasting them over pine fire; they were slightly charred and peeled for eating, a sweet fragrance locked in my tongue, surpassing the roasted taro of the ancient temple, or the noisy crowds of the streets; I felt that the flavors of the past were not yet perfect. So I made another vow, when will I be able to build a hut on a bend of the Chunjiang River?</p>
<p>In the spring of Jiaxu, I returned to my hometown for a short rest, enjoying the tranquility of the Xi Stream. One day, from the Zhuxi Lake, I climbed Mount Xulang, and traced the source of the stream to the Qi family. The mountains were like urns, the sunlight all green, countless ancient trees, with bamboo soaring green among them. Leaning on them, I surveyed, and purple buds touched my shoes; there were also a few new bamboo shoots, just shedding their powdery sheaths, unfolding their natural potential; I guessed they grew tall, weaving green past my lap. Thinking of the difficulty of nurturing one thing so much, how could I bear to trample on them even more? So I stood listening to the flow of the spring, the singing of the birds, the harmony of the pine and the wind, entrusting my ears and eyes to them. At noon, I ate my meal, the mountain family lacked fish and meat, and cut off spring wine, so I indulged myself in a steaming bowl of fragrant rice and bamboo shoots, filled to the brim. When hunger struck at sunset, they brought out dried bamboo shoots, extremely sweet and clear, realizing that what I had tasted on the river was not enough. The next morning, before the morning dew had dried, they gathered wild mushrooms in a basket, and stewed them with bamboo shoots; they were sweet and mellow, the color turned like amber, were these the dishes of mountain guests? Or the relics of the upper immortals? The taste of Great Harmony, indescribable, so I longed for mountain living.</p>
<p>My family also had a small garden, and opening the curtain, there was a bamboo fence, luxuriantly growing, where I slept and studied in my childhood. I remember when spring was ending, every time I saw my sister picking bamboo shoots, I had to whisper, "Please leave a little for the next meal!" And so it became routine. There were also those that were fortunate enough to avoid the axe, and I would see them grow from inches to feet, from shoots to leaves, and I would remember them silently. Today, those that just reached the window, I had looked at them overnight, and they were already slightly obstructing the sunlight; before long, they would go over the eaves; and by summer, they could attract a cool wind. Occasionally facing them, I often indulged in foolish thoughts: if I were a bamboo shoot, I would be friends with the cicadas every day. At that time, the clear sounds were still singing, my eyes secretly watching, unable to restrain myself. Since falling into the Jianghu world, this dream has long disappeared—occasionally the thoughts warm my heart, but only a brief trace remains. Last winter, returning home to visit, seeing the bamboo shoots swaying, all flowering and bearing fruit, thinking that bamboo only bears fruit when it is old, a sign of decline, is it like my hair has lost its youthful color, and my beard is growing gray day by day? Now, as the spring season is coming to an end, I imagine that on the banks of the Fuchun River, at the head of Zhuxi Lake, the purple bamboo shoots are sprouting; and I am driven by hunger along the road, still wandering without rest, I wonder if the desire to return to the mountains must wait until my hair turns white?</p>

Bourlton is an old billiards player who once won the Shanghai billiards championship. Although he has been neglecting practice recently, he still plays with great experience. Ding is also a strong player, and his luck is unique. Yesterday, he had very good luck, often surviving in desperate situations. The competition between the two sides was fierce. Ding reversed the dangerous situation with the last shot, reaching 600 points first, only ten points apart. The current situation is that China has a total of 2285 points, and England has 1636 points. Today is the final act, with the billiards king Li Gongying playing against Bernal. There will be a wonderful performance. Li can control victory, and China winning the championship is expected to be no problem. The details of yesterday's competition are as follows.</p>
<p>Fierce Competition Between the Two Sides</p>
<p>After the start of the game, both sides won points, evenly matched. Ding scored 38 points (the highest score of yesterday's game) at the 24th shot, and then added 27 points in one shot. At that time, the score difference was 35 points. Bourlton suddenly overtook with two wonderful shots, with 193 points against 189. After that, Bourlton had 11 shots without scoring, while Ding continuously scored points. At the 49th shot, he took the lead again with a difference of 68 points. Unfortunately, good times do not last long. Ding lost consecutive called shots, and Bourlton scored 16 and 30 points in a row, reducing the difference to 12. Then it was Ding's turn to shoot, and he scored 26 points in one shot with two double shots. Bourlton tried his best to follow, and scored 27 points in one shot at the 61st shot, only 6 points behind Ding.</p>
<p>Ding Mingyi Wins</p>
<p>Bourlton continued to work hard and scored 28 and 17 points, taking the lead by 32 points. Ding also scored 13 and 26 points to catch up. Bourlton suddenly got an unexpected pocket shot, scoring 19 points. From then on, he led the way. Ding, although he survived several desperate shots, led by 71 points with 531 against 460, the largest difference in yesterday's game. After that, Ding calmly fought, accumulating points. Bourlton repeatedly missed good opportunities, and his momentum suddenly declined. At the 104th shot, the difference was only 4 points. Bourlton then scored 590 points, and Ding scored 5788 points at that time. With the last shot, Ding even scored 22 points, ending the game first. The giant points of yesterday's game were 38, 27, 33, 29, 26, and 27 for Ding, and 30, 27, 28, 26, 25, and 24 for Bourlton.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the second day of the Sino-Western handball competition, with a total of four singles groups. The third singles game was originally He Shuo against Qi Ge Ling, but Chen Linan temporarily replaced He. Afterwards, He would specialize in doubles, and Chen would attend all singles games. Chen Linan had some wonderful shots last night, but unfortunately, his luck was poor. In the first game, Qi Ge Ling won with 21 to 12. There were even more dangerous balls in the second game, and the scores were very close. When Chen took the lead with 17 to 10, he then scored several balls in a row, and won the game back with 21 to 15. In the last game, both of them showed fatigue. As a result, Chen was physically inferior, and when he was tied at 17 to 17, Qi scored four points in a row again, ending the game with 21 to 17. The overall result was that Qi Ge Ling won two to one. In the last game, Hua Fenggang and Rankin appeared. Fenggang was slightly careless, resulting in the loss of the first game with 13 to 21. In the second game, Fenggang shook up his spirits, leading strongly with 5 to 0. The situation was extremely tense. Although he tried his best to display his wonderful shots, Rankin caught up quickly and was defeated 12 to 21 in reverse. The results of each group are as follows.</p>

<p>This city’s universities received a letter from the Northeastern Youth Education Relief Office of the Ministry of Education yesterday, stating: Regarding the measures for remedying lost graduation certificates, graduation certifications, and certificates due to the September 18th Incident issued by Northeastern schools before the September 18th Incident, which were previously presented to the Ministry of Education by this office in October of the 23rd year of the Republic and were deemed to have impractical aspects. This office, after considering the actual situation and circumstances, presented an amended version for approval in October of the previous year. Subsequently, it has been found that many schools are not familiar with the amended measures, making it difficult to standardize the procedures. Therefore, last month, the Ministry of Education ordered that all schools be notified to ensure uniformity. In addition to separate letters, a copy of the amended measures is enclosed for your reference. The attached measures are as follows: 1. When there is a need to verify graduation certificates issued by Northeastern schools before the September 18th Incident, schools may send letters to this office for verification and certification. 2. Graduation certifications issued by Northeastern schools in the autumn of the 20th year of the Republic have expired. From August 1st of the 24th year of the Republic, regardless of whether they have been used for further education, if proof of qualification is needed, it shall be handled in accordance with the Provisional Measures for Further Education and Transfer of Northeastern Students. 3. If graduation certificates of graduates from Northeastern schools before the September 18th Incident were indeed lost due to the Incident and there is solid evidence, when there is a need to prove their qualifications, this office may submit a request to the Ministry of Education to verify the records and issue a certification.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Sichuan Educator Ye Chengyi Discusses His Observations on National Education Across the Country (Part 2) <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Q: What is your impression after inspecting national education across the country? A: Looking at the entire national education of the past, it can be said that it has lost all credibility and achieved nothing. Looking at the present, it can be said that there has been a slight turnaround, but there is still a lack of a comprehensive fundamental plan. It is just some poor planning and stopgap measures, mostly to maintain appearances and perfunctorily deal with things. Moreover, opinions vary, and everyone goes their own way. Therefore, national education lacks a common central goal, and the education community lacks unified and sincere unity. Of course, there is no strength, and many difficult problems that should be and can be solved cannot be solved. As for the general shortcomings that I have felt, there are four: 1. Lack of driving force for promotion. There is no great power or determination from the authorities above to act as a driving force, and there is no unified propaganda force from the education community below to provide guidance. 2. Lack of economic power. The national education expenditure borne by the Chinese people each year averages less than two dimes, which is twenty to hundreds of times less compared to the average of thirty yuan for Americans and five yuan for Japanese. No wonder there are no achievements. 3. Lack of good teachers, because the treatment of primary school teachers is too meager and their status is too low, so there is a trend that the wise and capable do not want to do it. Occasionally, there are wise and capable people who become children's kings because they have no rice at home, and they go to the countryside because they have no wealthy relatives or friends. Therefore, while teaching, they are thinking about other careers and are not content with their positions. 4. Lack of unified national spirit training. Area A focuses on progressive trends, Area B emphasizes conservative colors, the interior values courage, and Area D promotes concession. Of course, it is impossible to cultivate a unified and integrated national consciousness in this way. Q: What are your methods and suggestions for implementing national education in the future? A: Running national education is not for current needs and should avoid seeking quick results to be used as decorations for stopgap measures. Even if we apply two years of education to all six- or eight-year-old children across the country, not only will we fail to achieve the goal of drastically removing national shortcomings and establishing a new national consciousness, but even if we do achieve it, how can children under the age of ten bear the responsibility of saving the current national crisis? From this perspective, running national education across the country should not be rushed for quick results but should have far-reaching, continuous, and constantly progressive plans, and there will be a day to achieve the goal in the future. My suggestions are: First, the state should centrally manage and convene a national education conference to coordinate opinions from all parties, create an educational focus, and formulate fundamental principles that are common throughout the provinces. Unite people in the education circle and primary school teachers to form the National Education Promotion Association. With united will from top to bottom and national unity, action should show the strength of the education world and strive forward, instead of hesitating and diversifying powers by promoting novel names on wrong roads (such as the experimental area). Second, spend according to what is available and fully allocate national education funds. The funds used for sorting out cultural relics of the old capital, holding cultural undertakings, building memorial halls, opening exhibitions, building national art clubs, building university school buildings, as well as repairing temples and graves, should be saved as much as possible and the funds should be concentrated for the promotion of compulsory education. Even if the government clearly orders the collection of national education donations per household, averaging three yuan depending on the people's ability to bear the burden and adjusting the amount according to their means, it is also feasible. If full effort is not put in, there is no need to talk about the issue of national education with empty voices and floating words. Third, raise the status and treatment of teachers. The monthly salary should be at least fifty yuan, and a seniority-based salary increase system should be implemented. Then, teachers should be carefully selected, and those who can truly be national role models and serve as teachers should be filled. If the meager salary of eight or nine yuan is still used to disperse them in the countryside, it will only damage credibility and have no practical benefit. Fourth, implement simple and clear, unified national spirit training. Pay attention to removing the old ideas of reading to become an official and the inferior habits of favoritism and laziness, and establish a new national consciousness of public spirit, courage, and shame, and unremitting progress. The thinking of the general public should be simplified as much as possible, and too much will lose its effectiveness. The only requirement is that future citizens have a spirit of great impartiality, selfless dedication, unity, courage, justice, integrity, and unremitting progress, and not the inertia of being lifeless and getting by. In short, this is the model of a good citizen. Finally, in one word, implementing national education throughout the country and enrolling all children is an extremely difficult task to promote. Chinese people have always only cared about the present and have no long-term plans, only seeking surface appearances and no fundamental designs. Those who know that it is difficult and retreat, those with talent cannot avoid it. It must be known that the more difficult things are in the world, the more important they are. The promotion of national education today should take avoiding difficulties as the initial starting point in order to achieve thorough results from beginning to end.</p>
<p>School Survey</p>
<h3 id="e197">Overview of Shanghai British Schools (4) <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>In terms of substance, there are several types of routine training:</p>
<p>Religious Training: Every morning from 8:45 to 9:00, all students are required to line up and attend morning prayers in the chapel. The pastor often explains Christian doctrines and principles of conduct to the students during morning prayers.</p>
<p>Assembly Training: Students from each grade must first gather in the covered playground before each class. The physical education instructor oversees the lining up. When the first whistle is blown, all students must stand still and remain silent. When the second whistle is blown, students from each grade must line up properly and enter the classroom accordingly. If any student disrupts order during the lining up, their name will be recorded and they will be detained in the reflection room for half an hour on Monday afternoon to encourage self-reflection.</p>
<p>Scouting Training: Scouting training is now implemented in most British schools. This school has achieved considerable success in scouting training in the past. The school's scouts are now officially incorporated into the Shanghai Western Scouts Regiment. Participation in Western Scout activities in the past has also yielded good results. The school principal has designated a space specifically for scout activities and offices.</p>
<p>Prefect Training: Prefect training is a special type of training in British public schools. The purpose of this training is to select one or two students with good character and academics from each grade and ask them to assist the school in maintaining order among the students, while also providing various services to the school in all aspects. Many British schools are able to maintain a good school ethos mostly due to the loyal service of the prefects.</p>
<p>5. Methods to Promote Students' Academics and Self-Study</p>
<p>Although the teaching methods adopted by the school are mostly ordinary, the school pays great attention to students' academics. As mentioned in the previous section, the school teachers hold a monthly meeting every month. In the monthly meeting, each grade advisor must report the grades of each student in each subject during the month to the principal. In addition to the scores of all students in each subject in the grade, this transcript also lists the ranking of each student's score in each subject. At the same time, the ranking of the student's score in each subject in the previous month is also listed for comparison. If a student's score in a certain subject was third in the previous month, and the ranking of the score in the same subject in this month suddenly drops to fifteenth, the teacher of that subject must find out the reason for the student's academic decline. If the student's academic performance has declined due to laziness, the principal will call him to the principal's office to warn him. At the same time, he will be detained in the school from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM on Friday afternoon, and the teacher of that subject will supervise him to make up his homework. If the student still refuses to work hard to make up his studies and does not make progress, the principal will call him to the principal's office and beat him with a stick, and inform his parents to jointly supervise him. According to the school principal, this method of corporal punishment is sometimes quite effective.</p>
<p>The school's method of promoting students' self-study at home is also worth introducing here. A group of educators and members of parliament in Britain are advocating abolishing children's self-study work at home, and advocating to find ways to let children do the homework to be prepared for the next day at school. The school has not been able to abolish students' self-study work at home, but it can find ways to reduce it as much as possible, and at the same time provide appropriate guidance to students' self-study methods. It can be said that the school has no formally prescribed self-study work for students in the two years of preparatory courses (ie, high school); sometimes there is only a very small amount of informal self-study work. For students in the first year of middle school, there is only one type of prescribed self-study work per day. Students in the first year of middle school have only two types of prescribed self-study work per day. Students in the third year of middle school to the sixth year have at most three types of prescribed self-study work per day. The reason why the school can have this precise regulation is that teachers in each grade and each subject will have a consultation in advance to evenly distribute all the students' self-study work in a week, so that students will not be too busy or too empty on a certain night. In the timetable of each grade of the school, there is a blank line that can be filled in with the self-study work of each grade of students every night. The teacher posts this table in the classroom, and all the students can of course follow it.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Long-Term Settlements Can Be Safely Passed <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>This year's long-term settlements, since the large-scale consolidation on the 15th, to the 17th and 18th, all the Ningbo money shops' lenders came to organize everything. It has been precisely stipulated that the amount due on the 20th, more than 4 million in Ningbo loans, will all be transferred for relief. The interest rate, from 8.5 yuan to 10 yuan, all belongs to registered old accounts. As for new loans and recovered amounts, they are few. After several detailed investigations, there were only 70,000 to 80,000 in new loans, from foreign goods dealers and various factories, etc., with the largest amount not exceeding 10,000. The total amount recovered, according to this term's statistics, is less than 500,000. All the long-term loans from silver and money shops to the China National Exchange and the stock exchange for ticket discounting and mortgage credit, etc., have been approved for a one-term extension. The amount to be repaid in October is more than 10 million, so the difficult situation can be safely passed. In addition, various banks have rural development plans, so lending to the entire Shanghai market is simply limited. The amount due on the 21st is about 6 to 7 million. It is predicted that most of them will be old accounts that are simply transferred. It is currently heard that the total amount of long-term debts that have not yet been settled and should be settled still reaches a huge 20 to 30 million, of which Ningbo loans account for less than a quarter, about 5 to 6 million. And the number of Ningbo money shops recovering remittances to Ningbo is more than 100,000. According to people in the industry, this long-term settlement was fortunately prepared by all parties, so it was able to pass safely.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Securities: Post-Rise Correction of Public Bonds - Each Down 1 Jiao to 6 Jiao - <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange experienced a correction due to the rapid rise in recent days. However, the trend is still that long-term is weaker than short-term. Because the settlement period is approaching, there are few short sellers selling this month. The long-term bulls have been crowded in recent days, and naturally they will come out due to the rapid rise. The short sellers are also concentrated here. Types A and B have a lottery relationship, and those without goods dare not sell. On the surface, many parties did not dare to let go. Watching numbers 4, 11, and 43, etc., repeatedly raise prices, but there are many people who sell at high prices, and the crowded chips are really not easy to make them soar. The closer to settlement, or there may not be a change in the multi-party barriers. In the morning, it was heard that the initial auction was still rising by 1, 2 jiao to 4 jiao in the strong buying of numbers 4, 11, and 43, etc. However, the selling momentum became stronger and stronger, and numbers 47 and 48 were also sold, making types A and B unable to maintain their prices. The long-term A type fell sharply by 4 jiao. The market atmosphere was discouraged, and people's hearts were relaxed. In the second market, there was a frantic sale of numbers 16 and 35, etc. Although numbers 4, etc., still had an appetite, they felt unable to support the prices. All bonds fell uniformly. The long-term C type fell sharply by 4 jiao and a half. In the afternoon, the situation did not improve. Number 48 suddenly had a sale, which was quite enthusiastic. Number 16 also continued to sell. Types E and C fell another 3 jiao, and the rest also fell by 1, 2, or 3 jiao. Fewer transactions at the close, and the trend still failed to improve. Most continued to fall by 1, 2, or 3 jiao. As a result, prices fell uniformly by 1 jiao to 6 jiao. The total transaction amount was 6,575,000 yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared and listed on the right (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3 id="e204">Yarn and Cotton: Bullish Roll-Over - Standard Yarn Weak in Near Term, Tight in Far Term - <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is very weak in the near month due to the settlement. However, long-month bullish roll-over is more expensive. However, the gold merchants rarely take action, so the market is still in a state of silence. Judging from the overall situation, it is currently in a period of firm support.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Continues to Fall - Standard Yarn Opens Lower - The offers continued to decline, and the situation softened. Because the chips for delivery this month are sufficient, and warehouse hoarding has reached more than 30,000 bales, the popularity is depressed, and the market price is slowly falling. As a result, each month fell by 6.7 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market opened flat in the afternoon this month, but some bulls began to roll over, so it was weak in the near term and tight in the far term. As a result, the near month fell by 2 jiao compared to the closing price in the morning, and the far term rose by 1.3 jiao. It was found that Changji sold 700 bales, Yuanji 700 bales, Mingde 450 bales, Zhengda 450 bales, Gengfeng 750 bales, Senlian 1,000 bales, Renfeng 750 bales, Tonghe 1,800 bales, Xinjian 1,400 bales, Jinghua 450 bales, Haoxing bought 700 bales, Deda 700 bales, Dafeng 1,550 bales, Shenji 1,350 bales, Taichang 800 bales, Changfeng 800 bales, Yuda 450 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices during the day are listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e205">This Month's Cotton: Bullish Side Again Claims to be Receiving Goods - Price Decline Relies on Control - <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market first fell and then rose. Although the short side used a large amount of coarse cotton to deliver, the bulls again claimed to be preparing to receive goods, and the far month still dragged in to increase the margin, which shows the determination of the bulls. However, the demand for spot cotton is currently sluggish.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton First Falls Then is the Same</p>
<p>The standard cotton market opened lower in the morning. Because American cotton fell by 3 to 10 pounds, Indian cotton rose by 0.25 to 1 rupee, and Osaka Three-Product Cotton fell by 2.3 jiao, the market sentiment was flat. The short side has 110,000 dan of goods to deliver, and although the bulls are preparing to accept them, a virtual atmosphere still comes to control it. As a result, each month fell by 5 cents to 1 jiao and a half compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market opened higher in the afternoon, and the near-month trend turned strong due to strong buying. Moreover, a certain company came to drag in a large amount, and the far-month market rose again. As a result, each month rose by 1 jiao to 1 jiao and a half compared to the closing price in the morning. It was found that Jinchang sold 1,800 dan, Yuanji 4,600 dan, Senkang 2,100 dan, Tongfeng 1,400 dan, Runkang 1,300 dan, Yikang 2,600 dan, Yuanxingchang 1,700 dan, Yongda 900 dan, Tonghe 900 dan, Xincheng 900 dan, Dafu bought 8,300 dan, Tongji 4,400 dan, Juxing 1,400 dan, Renfeng 1,200 dan, Yuan Yi Yi 1,300, Dachangcheng 1,600 dan, Dafeng 2,700 dan, Changhe 2,300 dan.

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with a stagnant market condition, and each month fell by 3 pounds or rose by 1 pound. Early in the morning, brokers bought, and the market price was firm due to lack of rain in the dry area. Later, due to bull closings and spot merchants selling short, a reaction occurred. Finally, it rose again due to inter-industry buying and near-month short positions covering. It is rumored that the stockpiled cotton office will not sell futures unless the difference between futures and spot reaches a certain level. Before the close, the stock market was sluggish, and both Wall Street sold, and cotton farmers sold short, still returning to weakness. It is estimated that spot fell by 4 pounds, and futures fell by 2 to 9 pounds. Borrowed cotton sold 25,000 bales each in Memphis and Texas. According to the Cotton Exchange, the stockpiled cotton office sold 5,000 bales of spot last week, and no futures. British cotton spot fell by one point, and futures fell by two or three points. Indian cotton short positions covered and futures traders bought, encountering European exporters selling. Later, it softened due to bad news from Liverpool and bull closings. It is estimated that Pingguo rose by two and a half, and Aomula fell by 0.25 rupee, and Bairoxi rose by 0.5 to 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (20th telegram).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay on the 21st, the opening forecast for Bairoxi cotton was 204 rupees for the April-May period and 205.5 rupees for the July-August period, both up 0.75 rupee from the previous day.</p>

<p>Overseas silk sales have not been smooth for a long time. The frequent decline in silk prices in Hengyan has followed, and New York has followed suit, making the domestic and foreign silk industries even more bleak. A lot of telegrams were sent out from this port for overseas sales, but there was no reply yesterday. The market atmosphere in Shanghai became more depressing, and users' silk sales were still stagnant. Even sporadic transactions were rare.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Soviet Russia Will Purchase Our Green Tea <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the trade of Chinese tea with Russia has only seen a slight export of black tea from Hubei, Hunan, Qimen, Ningzhou, and Fuzhou. As for the sales of green tea, they have been completely taken over by Japanese tea. Because Japanese tea is cheap and can be sold on long-term credit, but the taste does not suit the Russian stomach, causing the accumulation of inventory and difficulty in selling. The Ministry of Commerce of Russia, in view of the difficulty in promoting Japanese tea, has decided to purchase Chinese green tea again. The procedures are under consideration.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Wenzhou New Tea Begins Picking <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>New green tea in Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, has now begun to be picked. Generally, tea farmers, because the weather has been sunny and warm recently, are deeply afraid that the tea branches will easily age, and have already processed and picked leaves. Looking at the gardens on the mountains, the branches and leaves are lush, and the output of new tea there is expected to be a bumper harvest. Tea houses such as Zhengtaychang and Chen Qianchun have already started searching for new goods. It is expected that the first batch will be transported to Shanghai for sale in early next month.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Grain, Flour, and Wheat Sellers are Quiet - Market Initially Weak, Then Firm <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, each month initially showed a weak and then slightly firm trend. The quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago fell back by 4, 5, and 6 jiao, Canada fell by 4 and 5 jiao. When the price opened, the market sentiment was weak, but later, due to the wait-and-see attitude of the bulls and bears, there were fewer sellers, so each month returned to stability. In the new flour market, the price is so high that sellers are not as prosperous as in previous years. The general issue is still the currency problem, and the inland areas are unwilling to take risks. When the market opened in the afternoon, transactions were even clearer, and the price was similar to the morning closing price. Because factories are waiting and seeing, there are fewer outside sellers, so it is spinning without moving. If the weather is good later, the final outcome can still be seen.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning, each month showed an initial flat and then stable trend. When the price opened, the market sentiment was weak due to the large quoted price of foreign wheat. Then, because sellers were quiet and the flour market saw good sales, the asking price was raised by 1 or 2 fen. When the market opened in the afternoon, transactions were unusually quiet, and the price was similar to the morning. It was heard that the short side still had empty positions, but the Jinpu, Shanghai-Ningbo, and other gangs were all inactive. The quietness of the market is due to this. The current wheat market is still flat and stable. Shandong Suzhou wheat was offered at 5.32 yuan, totaling more than 1,000 bags, and was handled by Fuxin.</p>
<p>US wheat market conditions: there was scattered light rain in the dry area, and continued rain is expected. It is reported that dust storms and aphids occurred in the central United States, but this was offset by profit-taking from the more prosperous. Murray estimates that the total wheat production is 475 million bushels.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of more than 20 numbers arrived from the gang source (more than 4,000 stone of goods). The local sales were still flat. The thick and pure glutinous rice was scarce, and it could only be settled. The Tianjin and Dalian gangs were very happy to buy thin rice, with more than 2,000 bags. Because the selling price was called high, the market price returned by an angle. Du Yangjian and Yin Bianyuan were not honored.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 30 numbers arrived from various sources in Hexia. Various transactions in the market were normal. The price of Gao Baijing was settled, and the middle and sub-prices were called tight near the corner. The buying was not good in the noon market, and the closing price was increased by 3 or 5 fen. The price of early thin rice was tight, and the price of Yang Du Jian was also firm and tight. The price of Yin Yuan was stable, and the price of Bian Yuan was slightly weak. The customer's tip was dull, and the price shape was similar to the previous one. The other goods were not honored.</p>

<p>Yesterday, passenger Xian rice turned flat and weak again. The fourth arrival continued to have various ports in Jiangxi and Wenzhou arriving in Shanghai, but the passenger storage disappeared, and the local market became weak day by day. In the past two days, 6,000 to 7,000 bags of newly arrived passenger Xian rice have arrived, but yesterday's digestion was only 66 bags of Jiangxi rice and 290 bags of Taizhou rice, totaling only more than 300 bags. However, the trading storage is still insisting on support and is unwilling to sell lightly, so the market price has not fallen sharply. However, considering the actual sales at present, the market may have to soften later.</p>

<p>Yesterday's yellow soybean market situation, because Dong Province soybeans, the source has arrived (70,000 to 80,000 bags were transported by Hai Shun Wheel, etc.), the popularity continued to decrease, and the price fell by 5 fen compared to the previous day. The sales market was still not improving, and only 200 bags of Si Ping Street soybeans, 400 bags of Shayang, 30 bags of Du soybeans, and 650 bags of green beans were traded. The cargo of Hongliang Niuzhuang was connected, and the purchasing power of liquor factories in the interior was reduced due to the economic impact, so the market atmosphere also turned down. Yesterday, 4,200 bags of Hongke from Niuzhuang were sold at a price of 3.52 yuan. Bean oil was also weak, but it was heard in the afternoon that the Dalian market was rising again, so the market may have the possibility of rebounding today.</p>

<h3 id="e216">Sugar Market: Chao Sugar Falls with Shantou Exchange Rate <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was still stagnant, and there was no sign of recovery. The guild's settlement was 22 yuan for 24 coarse sand white spot, 6.9 yuan for re-export goods, 15.8 yuan for Dongchi (MS), 21.4 yuan for No. 4 white spot, 6.9 yuan for No. 4 re-export goods, 6.5 yuan for No. 8, and 6.54 yuan for No. 9, all with little change. This factory's Zhenji No. 1 cotton white was 20.6 yuan, and Dahua Jinxin No. 1 was 20.8 yuan, all with previous discounts.</p>
<p>Due to the contraction of Shantou's exchange rate, the production price of domestic Chao sugar has returned to slack. The Qinghu Lake went down by one or two jiao, and the red sand went down by three or four jiao, so the market's quotation slightly softened. The traveling party waited and watched without entering, only the Jian gang opened 17.4 yuan for Shilu Bai, and 9.9 yuan for Chongbing Huaying, which was still good in color, but its identity was very soft, so the grain was obtained at a price, and only dozens of bags were traded in total.</p>

<p>The sales of golden needle vegetables in Guangdong have resumed recently, and more than 300 bags have been processed before and after, which will be loaded in the near future, so the market has become tight, and the price increase has started again. The Haoxiang Zhuang vegetables are quoted at 28.5 yuan, the top Zhuang vegetables are called 31 and 2 yuan, and the more common goods are 26 yuan. The rise this time, the grounding has gradually become stable, because the stock is indeed rare, and the sales have turned prosperous, and the market seems to have a tightening trend.</p>

<p>Kelp, also known as deer horn vegetables, is also known as chicken feet vegetables, and the names vary. There are distinctions between lion hair, Ceylon, dragon buds, Wudun, and Diphi. It is produced in various places in Nanyang Singapore, Qatar, Ceylon, and Makassar, and is sold in various provinces. It is sticky and easy to freeze. It is fried with fire, and it also solidifies in the hot summer. It is used to make dishes, and the lower ones are used as glue. There are very few goods in the spring, which has led to an increase in the market price. Yesterday, the lion hair dishes opened at 18.4 yuan, the Ceylon dishes opened at 15.8 yuan, the dragon buds opened at 14.5 yuan, and the middle grade opened at 13.1 yuan. There is no market for Wudun Di Long.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the weather suddenly became hot, and the trade of woolen white goods was therefore suddenly smooth. The trend of plain white flannel is popular, and the market is also expensive, because its sales are launched, and each gang buys together, the outlet is very active, and the Shanghai market is short of spot goods, resulting in the most popular goods in recent days. The 6 yuan Guangjing white flannel now seems to have a tendency to break peaches.</p>

<p>The Xingye Iron Factory's rebar has been selling very well in this port recently. Even foreign customers and the construction industry are ordering it because of its low selling price, superior quality, and ease of sale. The raw materials of the rebar produced by the factory are made of ship plates from the United Kingdom and the United States, so its elasticity is very strong. Recently, it was heard that the factory has reduced the market price to attract customers. For example, 3-point yuan rebar and 3-point square rebar are sold at 125 yuan per ton, and 2-point 2-point half 3-point Guangyuan is sold at 118 yuan. Therefore, general users and dealers have been ordering in large quantities for days. It is found that the market has opened more than 300 tons, but most of them are sold by hardware stores along North Suzhou Road.</p>
<p>In addition, the new ocean yuan from 2 points to 4 points produced by the factory is sold at 6.25 yuan per dan, and the new ocean board from 2 points to 4 points is opened at 6.5 yuan per dan, and the Tonghua color flat silk is sold at 6.5 yuan per dan.

<p>Because the traveling party's entry was stalled, Sand Nai showed a slight soft appearance, but the stock in the Shanghai market was thin, and a certain number wanted to stick to it, intending to collect, so the asking price rose again, and the cost of incoming goods has indeed increased a lot, so it is loose and tight again. The No. Fang is unwilling to sell, and the traveling stomach is not greedy, and it is gradually becoming a support situation.</p>

<p>— Wang Shiying</p>
<p>This disease is most common among young people, mostly caused by masturbation.</p>
<p>The symptoms include nocturnal emission with dreams, nocturnal emission without dreams, seminal emission during bowel movements during the day, and ejaculation upon seeing erotic stimulation. If it is not treated in a timely manner, it can easily lead to premature ejaculation and kidney failure. It is not suitable for marriage and hinders offspring. Health is lost and happiness is not part of it.</p>
<p>The essence is the most precious thing in the body, not only the source of offspring, but also the brain, blood, nerves, and all parts of the body, which are nourished by it. Therefore, patients with this disease often have mental weakness, insomnia, anemia, pale complexion, neurasthenia, muscle wasting, and other pathological conditions.</p>
<p>The patient, Liu Jian'e, came to seek treatment for his seminal emission last fall because he was about to get married. After I prescribed medicine for the symptoms, I instructed him to purchase and take "Hemitus Solid Essence Tablets" from Wuzhou Pharmacy to consolidate his seminal gate. After taking three boxes in a row, the seminal emission was cured. He also took "Reproductive Element" to replenish essence and replenish deficiency. The whole body regained development. Before and after, it was like two different people.</p>

<p>— Qiao Wenbin</p>
<p>This condition is the most common type of sexual neurasthenia. It is generally caused by masturbation or excessive sexual activity. It is extremely easy for those who marry early to suffer from it. Patients experience a decline and weakening of their reproductive glands. A slight stimulus will trigger ejaculation. Therefore, it is often the case that after many years of marriage, conception is impossible.</p>
<p>This condition can be treated more quickly with electrotherapy administered by a venereal disease expert equipped with the latest electrotherapy equipment. The most appropriate medication is a preparation of reproductive glands.</p>
<p>Patient Yuan Shenzhai, age thirty-two, from Hangzhou, came for consultation last summer, seeking treatment for premature ejaculation. He complained of losing his virility and being unable to conceive after a long marriage. I instructed him to purchase the famous medicine "Reproductive Element" from Taihe Pharmacy and take it. For the sake of rapid treatment, I also introduced him to a venereal disease expert for electrotherapy. Before a full month had passed, the premature ejaculation was cured. His body quickly regained its strength, and his vitality was reborn, as if he had been recreated. The relationship between him and his wife was harmonious, even better than during their honeymoon. Early this spring, Mr. Yuan sent a letter of thanks, from which I learned that his wife was already several months pregnant.</p>

<p>Last winter, a patient named Yin Zhaosheng came to complain of rheumatic bone pain. He said that he had repeatedly taken wind-dampness medicinal wine and bone pain medicine, but without any effect. After my examination, I found that Mr. Yin's disease originated from uncleared residual toxins. I immediately instructed him to purchase "Strongston's Bone Pain Tablets" from Zhongfa Pharmacy to eliminate the wind-dampness and residual toxins. Because the medication was appropriate for the condition, he took only four and a half boxes and was completely cured. He happily thanked me and left.</p>

<p>(Letter from Mr. Zou of Tianzhu Church Street in this city) I suffered from stomach pain in my youth due to irregular eating habits. When the pain came, I felt like I was going to faint. I tried almost every medication, but they only provided temporary relief and could not cure the root cause. I had no choice but to listen to a friend's advice and smoke to relieve the pain, which led to addiction. (Omission) Up until now, it has been nearly twelve years. The addiction has become heavier, the toxins have become deeper, and the stomach pain remains. I cannot stop taking stomach medicine, and it is difficult to quit smoking. I am very distressed. Previously, I read in this publication that "Stomach Pain Elixir" can cure stomach pain, and "Stomach Invigorator" can nourish the stomach. The famous smoking cessation remedy "Reproductive Element" also has the effect of eliminating toxins, breaking addiction, reversing decline, and restoring weakness. I first purchased four or five boxes each from Huamei Pharmacy and Zhongxi Pharmacy. After taking the medicine, the pain was relieved, my stomach became healthier, my body became stronger, and the addiction was broken. I successfully quit smoking safely.</p>

<p>(Letter from Mrs. Ni Xiamin of Lanzhou) I suffer from leukorrhea and have no way to treat it. My body is weak, and many diseases have developed. My menstruation is irregular, my uterus is cold, and my abdomen aches. My breasts are withered, and my face is withered and yellow. I have been married for eight years and have not conceived. I am criticized by my in-laws and rejected by my husband. My happiness has disappeared, and my body and mind are in pain. Last autumn, I sent a letter to the Q&amp;A section of this publication. I was told that the famous medicine "Female Reproductive Element" and "Leukorrhea Relief" could be used internally and externally for treatment. I immediately purchased half a dozen of each by airmail. I secretly treated myself according to the instructions. (Omission) Before I finished using them, I was completely cured. My menstruation was regulated, and the leukorrhea disappeared. My blood was abundant, and my spirit was strong. My breasts developed, and I regained my health and beauty. I am now pregnant. I am continuing to take "Female Reproductive Element" to calm the fetus and strengthen my body. I believe that the health and happiness I have today are all due to the treatment methods taught in the Q&amp;A section of this publication. I am expressing this out of gratitude.</p>

<p>Regulate menstruation, treat leukorrhea, eliminate toxins, break addiction, reverse decline, restore weakness, and restore health and beauty!</p>
<p>Patient Mrs. Hong Qingtang has been addicted to smoking for many years. She is only twenty-eight years old. The smoking toxins have damaged her, and her chest and back are almost flat. She also suffers from scanty menstruation, irregular periods, and persistent leukorrhea. Last winter, she came to my clinic through the introduction of her relative, Mr. Hong. I used "Female Reproductive Element" to treat her disease and help her quit smoking, and used "Leukorrhea Relief" externally to treat her leukorrhea. Mrs. Hong was instructed to purchase them from Zhongxi Pharmacy. Both internal and external treatments were used. The leukorrhea cleared up first, and the menstruation was also regulated. The smoking toxins disappeared, and the smoking addiction was also broken. Qi and blood were replenished, and muscles developed, restoring the health and beauty of her youth many years ago. Looking in the mirror, she looked like a completely different person.</p>

<p>Sexual dysfunction, loss of vitality, kidney weakness, turbid urine, all cured!</p>
<p>Patient Weng Shangbin, age twenty-nine, committed masturbation before adulthood and excessive sexual activity after marriage, resulting in premature ejaculation and kidney weakness. He could not fulfill his duties as a husband, and his wife complained. He consulted doctors and took medicine, but there was no improvement. His spirit weakened day by day, and his essence was exhausted. His body was weak and thin, and his body and mind were decadent. Last autumn, he visited my clinic seeking treatment. I diagnosed that he also suffered from turbid urine. I performed the latest scientific surgical painless electrical therapy. Because Mr. Weng's root cause was the destruction of the reproductive glands, which could not be directly reached by other agents, I instructed him to purchase "Reproductive Element" from Huamei Pharmacy. The effects were obvious after taking the medicine, so he continued to take half a dozen with peace of mind. The premature ejaculation was cured first, and the kidney weakness was also cured. His spirit was strong, his essence was abundant, his muscles were strong, and his body was healthy. His vitality was like that of a dragon and tiger.</p>

<h3 id="e235">Guangzhou Values "Virtuous Mother and Good Wife" Education <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Wei</p>
<p>I remember it was more than a year ago: Perhaps the Guangdong authorities were concerned about the women's community there, so we successively read many news reports in the newspapers about their efforts in various women's issues. For example, issuing orders to prohibit "men and women bathing together," "men and women walking together," and even "eating together" and "sleeping together," etc. — all of these were to maintain the respect (?) of women and to focus on the local "morality!"</p>
<p>Recently, we read another new message in the newspaper: they are now focusing on the education of women there! According to the report! They are preparing to send principals of women's normal schools and others to go abroad to the east to investigate the women's education in our fellow country, "Great Japan," with particular emphasis on the education of "virtuous mother and good wife." However, the normal school students there rose up to oppose it, and at the same time, they printed a declaration to their principal. The language was very passionate and sympathetic, it is said.</p>
<p>Indeed, they have not relaxed on all issues concerning women, but unfortunately we have not had the opportunity to read the students' declaration of opposition; we do not know what their arguments and opinions are. However, from our point of view, it is not accidental that the Guangzhou authorities today want to focus on the "virtuous mother and good wife" system of education.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the "virtuous mother and good wife" system was originally a product of the private system in feudal society. Therefore, it is in the same fate as the social system, and it collapses with the collapse of feudal society. Therefore, following the great "May Fourth Movement," Chinese women have achieved considerable success in society — breaking through the chains of the family and moving towards the avenue of society.</p>
<p>However, things are not as simple and easy as people hoped: under the initial, incomplete revolutionary movement, the deep-rooted feudal remnants, under the protection and utilization of imperialism, finally prevailed everywhere stubbornly, and formed our current "semi-colonial and semi-feudal society"!</p>
<p>Therefore, before long, under the dictatorial iron fist of Hitler in Germany, a "Three K Movement" was produced — the first letter of the three words "Kinder, Küche, Kirche" (children, kitchen, church) in German — and shouted the "women's duty is to raise children" (spoken by Hitler at the women's conference in the National Socialist Party) "new virtuous mother and good wife system." Following that, in our country, we also heard some people singing the slogan of "women return to the family."</p>
<p>Although this slogan reveals its naivety and smallness under the current situation where our social dynamics are changing dramatically, it can be said that focusing on this "new virtuous mother and good wife" system under the Guangzhou authorities' consistent ban on "men and women bathing together," "walking together," etc. is "a matter of course!" What's more, in this "Great Japanese Empire," their women's "goodness" and their eternal "service" to men are world-famous! Therefore, under the consistent efforts of the Japanese ruling authorities to preserve this glorious "national essence," and even under the admiration and praise of people from various "civilized countries," the Guangzhou authorities have finally taken it as "the stone of other mountains" and specially sent many scholars there to investigate!</p>
<p>However, in such a contradictory situation, we are indeed somewhat afraid to imagine: what year are they "trying" to pull today's era back to? And can the sprouts of some poor "women's movements" and the slight, superficial, and local "equality" gained since the "Republic of China" really be thrown into the dark ocean so ruthlessly? In our so-called "source of revolution!"</p>

<p>— Xin Ye</p>
<p>—Clippings of Local Customs—</p>
<p>The spring morning sun is very charmingly spreading across the fields, and the morning breeze carries a intoxicating fragrance; Plum Blossom Village is so intoxicated by the gentle nature.</p>
<p>The village is quiet, but in the jade belt-like small river surrounding the village, there are several pairs of ducks swimming and playing under the green willows. Although the weather has warmed up in spring, there is not a farmer's shadow to be found in the surrounding fields, only some rape flowers and bean flowers are broadcasting a lonely fragrance in the air.</p>
<p>It was the first day of the opera at the Double Guanyin Temple. All the villagers went to watch it with their families; Old Lady Tuo was setting up a snack stall in front of the City God Temple, rushing to do temporary business on the opera stage, so she and her old husband got up early in the morning to go to the stall to tidy up and arrange things, leaving only her nineteen-year-old daughter Aying at home to cook:</p>
<p>"Aying, after you eat at home, put our meals in the lunch basket and send them over." Old Lady Tuo instructed her like this when she left.</p>
<p>The sun was passing by the east. The men, women, old, and young in the village had eaten breakfast and gone to the opera stage. Even a few more exquisite and lively dogs wagged their tails and followed their masters to join in the fun.</p>
<p>In the early years, when the situation was good, the Double Guanyin Temple used to stage two operas every spring and autumn, and at least three shows were performed each time; but in recent years, the year has been really bad, and the Double Guanyin Temple has stopped ringing the gong for more than ten years in a row. It is rare that Chief Wang is willing to start performing two operas this year, which will naturally make this group of villagers who have not had their opera addiction for ten years go crazy.</p>
<p>The main road where people come and go gradually became sparse. The Double Guanyin Temple was beginning to make a fuss. The loud gongs and drums clearly floated over Plum Blossom Village, over Cai Mu Ridge, and over Gu Jia Bu, causing some mothers who were still dressing up or feeding their children and changing clothes at home to panic, and those who were already on the road to speed up their pace. At this time, Aying also quickly packed the food, prepared to put on her own clothes and go to the opera stage.</p>
<p>"Aying, the opera has already started!" Third Lady Yellow Head, supporting her child, stood at the door and urged Aying.</p>
<p>"Okay, come in and wait for me!" Aying, while putting a twisted silver bracelet on her wrist, replied to her in the room.</p>
<p>"No, I'm going first. You come here. I can't walk fast with a small person." She said, but without looking back, she walked past under the hackberry tree.</p>
<p>The village became quieter and quieter every moment, and the people were getting fewer and fewer. Although a few families still left an old and weak old man to guard the house, they were hiding in the house. Outside the house, only a few old hens by the vegetable garden were leisurely leading a group of chicks walking in the sun as usual.</p>
<p>At this time, looking from the end of the village to Cai Mu Ridge, on that winding mountain path, several people were carrying a small sedan chair with cloth curtains, coming towards the village.</p>
<p>When the sedan chair arrived in the village, it stopped in front of Tuo's house. A young man wearing a gray woolen hat, a black mandarin jacket, and a blue robe walked out of the sedan chair. The four sedan bearers stood silently by the wall. The young man looked up at the old wall door and broke in.</p>
<p>—Bang—Bang—Another sedan bearer waited for the young man to enter the door and lit a small firecracker that he had brought.</p>
<p>Aying had already dressed up and was about to lock the door and go out with the lunch basket when she suddenly heard two crisp sounds, which could not help but shock her suddenly. But when she rushed out of the door with the lunch basket, she saw a strange young man rushing towards her. His face showed a ferocious and terrible smile: she wanted to avoid it, but it was too late, she had already been pounced on and hugged by him like a hungry eagle grabbing a chick. Then she screamed, and four sedan bearers also crowded in.</p>
<p>She threw the lunch basket in her hand, struggled, screamed, kicked, and cursed, but what use was it? She was pushed into the sedan chair by them with seven hands and eight feet, carried and lifted, and the young man also sat in it, holding her tightly. No matter how she cried, cursed, kicked, or struggled, he said with a smile:</p>
<p>"What are you crazy about? Since you are my wife, you will marry me sooner or later," he said, playfully hugging her waist. "I was going to marry you properly, why are your parents so unreasonable? Humph! Now let's see if you can get away with breaking the engagement?..." She kept crying, cursing, kicking, and struggling, and the sedan bearers were laughing and joking.</p>
<p>"Okay, we've got it! What are you still struggling with? You'll be laughing too late at night! Ha! Ha! Ha..."</p>
<p>—Bang—Bang—The small firecrackers sounded twice again, and the sedan chair was carried away.</p>
<p>The old hen was startled and led the chicks into the bamboo garden, but the mangy dog ​​left in the village kept barking madly — the quiet village suddenly stirred up a commotion, causing several old women guarding the house and Uncle Wu, who had a limp, to run over to see, but no one dared to interfere with bride kidnapping in Mei Xiang Village.</p>
<p>—Bang…Bang! When the sedan chair was about to go up Cai Mu Ridge, two pieces of the slope glass on the sedan window were broken by her, and her hands were dripping with blood. The bottom of the sedan chair was banging, causing the sedan pole to shake, and the sedan bearers' shoulders were sore.</p>
<p>"Damn it……Hey,……You are going to be burned by fire……Hey! Mom! Dad!" The voice gradually faded away.</p>

<p>Cherry Blossom Festival</p>
<p>The period from the end of March to the beginning of April is the season when cherry blossoms are in full bloom, a bewildering season of drunken revelry in Japanese customs!</p>
<p>At such times, the general petty bourgeois class</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Men, women, young and old all flock to famous cherry blossom spots to get drunk, carrying lunch boxes, wine, and various fruits and cakes. During that period, the train compartments are packed tightly. If you have urgent business, you might as well stand and be squeezed rather than sit down, because it is quite difficult to crawl out when you get off the train. But the railway bureau's income is the most satisfactory day of the year.</p>
<p>Just go to a place where cherry blossoms are in full bloom to have some fun, whether it is an embankment of rice paddies or Koganei.</p>
<p>On the way, you can see drunkards being supported by one or two people, or walking unsteadily alone, hoarsely singing some songs.</p>
<p>When you arrive at that place, it is like a den of demons in mythology. Not only do you have to beware of your ears not being split by the gongs and drums of those playing tricks, cymbals, and the miscellaneous sounds of hoarse singing or shouting, but you also have to be careful when walking that those drunkards don't rush over and drag you away with a sneer, or that their wine bottles don't hit your head or something, and at the same time, that you don't get pushed over by those crazy women (I almost got pushed off the wooden bridge in Inada Embankment by a group of women, but the hat on my head had already flown down to the water surface, like a round little speedboat gliding in the wind. Fortunately, a man rowed out a small boat parked on the shore, chased after it and grabbed it back, but I lost a dime's reward for nothing). Under the charming shadows of the cherry blossoms in full bloom, with white and slightly red flowers, some are sitting around drinking, some are drunkenly sleeping messily, some flowery-faced men and women are singing and dancing, and some are playing some funny tricks. But there are also tea pavilions for you to rest in, which are also temporary stalls set up by businessmen during the opportunity, fruit shops... You can sit and leisurely browse all kinds of scenes, especially middle-aged women singing and dancing with men, or walking with arms linked, pushing and shoving each other, and some old women lying on the grass humming strange songs that seem to be mourning and seem to be happy that they have lost their souls, or always twitching, murmuring, with red faces stretched with a trace of unknowing what it means smile lines.</p>
<p>Now it is cherry blossom season again. I don't think this drunken revelry will be affected by any coups, social turmoil, or various panics, will it?</p>
<h3 id="e238">Killing Crows <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Er He</p>
<p>Ever since the decision was made to turn Kong Forest into Kong Forest Park, the crows that had lived in Kong Forest for decades became something detestable. Kong Forest is in front of the school, and to the south of Kong Forest is a wide Mud Mountain River. Kong Forest has always been very desolate; apart from dozens of ancient cypresses and four or five Chinese tallow trees that could be encircled by several arms, there was only grass everywhere. In winter, Kong Forest almost becomes the crows' main camp. They spread their black wings, circling and wailing. When I first came here, I was afraid. I had never seen so many crows; they were like a large, disorganized army, occupying the entire Kong Forest. Because of my poor health, I always had to go out for a walk in the morning or evening, but as soon as I left the school gate, their endless chatter and the swarms of black shadows deeply attacked my heart, making me uneasy and making me feel like a great disaster was about to descend. But the people who live here seemed completely unmoved. Perhaps this is because they have become accustomed to it?</p>
<p>Thus, the crows' rule over Kong Forest has been going on for decades. (Perhaps it has been going on for centuries.) But misfortune finally befell the crows. Last winter, someone suggested tidying up Kong Forest, moving some flowers and stone benches in, and letting small boats drift on the Mud Mountain River. Turning the desolate Kong Forest into a place where people could relax and enjoy themselves would not be a bad thing. So this spring, the work of tidying up began. After removing the grass and planting flowers, it was felt that it was necessary to kill the crows. But the crows had already spent a lot of effort building nests, preparing to breed their offspring. Just taking the four or five tallow trees that could be encircled by several arms as an example, there were already thirty or forty nests. The large and small nests built on the ancient cypresses totaled no less than a hundred.</p>
<p>One evening, the southeast corner of the Confucius Temple was full of students, all watching the crows' nests in Kong Forest with curious eyes. They all knew what was about to happen. At that time, Mr. Zhao, with a smiling face, squatted quietly under the tallow trees with the steps of a thief. The crows were returning haphazardly from afar. They circled in the trees for a while and finally landed on the tallow trees. Suddenly, there were several "snap, snap, snap..." sounds, and three crows fell down amidst the students' clamor. Upon closer inspection, it was found that the bullets had hit their abdomens, and the bright red blood dripped onto the mud, turning black. The crows that were not dead, like soldiers deserting the battlefield, flapped their black wings in panic and fear, circling and wailing, little by little, in the air. But below, there was laughter and three dead crows.</p>
<p>The next day, many crows were exploring around Kong Forest. They flew away when they saw people. The third day was the same, and the fourth and fifth days... Then they gathered in Kong Forest again. Everyone felt it was inappropriate and asked Mr. Zhao to come and slaughter them again. So in the dark night, there were sudden "snap, snap, snap..." sounds, and when the flashlights shone, four more dead crows were seen. The next morning, servants were sent to completely destroy the crows' nests with long bamboo poles, and countless crow eggs were smashed on the ground...</p>
<p>Where will these crows go? They are not allowed to build nests on people's houses. (The local custom is that a crow's nest on a house is considered unlucky.) But they need a home and need to breed their offspring. Go and find a deserted forest that no one manages, but how many deserted forests are there? So I felt sorry for the crows.</p>
<p>Now, Kong Forest is surrounded by barbed wire. Inside the forest, there are wooden chairs, stone benches, and various flowers. In the Mud Mountain River, there are gentle small boats drifting. People come and go in an endless stream... Kong Forest has indeed become Kong Forest Park. Everyone's heart is filled with joy. Even if they have worries, even if they have melancholy and pain, if they think of that tragedy of killing crows, probably not many people will? But after all, it is a recent event. Strolling next to the tallow trees and ancient cypresses, perhaps someone will mention the killing of crows in their idle conversation. But after three or four years, ten or twenty years, when the killing of crows has faded from everyone's minds, people will only admire or talk about other absurd stories.</p>

<p>Opening "Jade Offering to Qingwen"</p>
<p>Fine weather, beautiful scenery, and a good festival are here. The hibiscus-filled garden redoubles the sorrow. Throughout the ages, beautiful women have had ill-fated lives. It's a pity that she died of illness. The little maid sadly and sincerely spoke. Baoyu is, teardrops soaking his clothes. Tonight is, respectfully offering water chestnuts and fragrant valley. A wisp of incense is offered to the hibiscus goddess. Sister, are you not sleeping in the White Emperor Palace? Tell me not to refuse love before the falling flowers. Sister is, coming into the world at the age of sixteen. Only five years together. She was naturally beautiful, pure, and chaste. The flowers were ashamed, and the moon was embarrassed by her beauty. Alas, she was born intelligent and suffered jealousy. Poison is an ancient saying. She cherished her sorrows and pitied her premature death. Where will her traces be found in the future? Again, the wise coffin was heartbroken. It will be difficult to share a grave in this life. It is remembered that her eyebrows were still painted with green smoke. Today, the jade ring is cold. The remaining medicine in the tripod is still there. The remaining tears on the collar are still fresh. Now, who can I tell my dreams to on the lonely bed? Again, I feel that there is no one in the empty room. At this moment, the steps are covered with dew, and the moon is dark, and her soul is faint. Only the sound of crickets can be heard. Unexpectedly, the hibiscus is withered and not what it used to be. To this day, the parrot in front of the curtain still calls her name. Your life is thin in the mound of yellow earth. You were very affectionate under the red gauze window. Separation in life and death was predestined. How many women find happiness? I will wait, meditate in an empty temple, and give up the world.</p>

<p>The sister of the E tile leans on the dressing table. Thinking of her man, there are few letters coming. Before parting, she still exhorted him. He promised me he would be back in five or six turns. He swore. Tell the Heaven tile. The earth nine, long three, gather as a pair. The family is thinking foolishly. Suddenly I hear three or four knocks at the door, I wonder who it is. Lightly open the two-five door. I only see the four-six official walking in. Fifth Auntie quickly sends over fragrant tea. Sixth Auntie lifts herself up to drink a cup of tea, brother. Where is the one-way blood nine? Because of him. He has been gone for a long time without a letter coming. Wise sister. I am three-six-nine at his house. Suddenly I think, two-six wise sister, can you arrange it? Take the four-red lantern to the boudoir. I ponder a song and secretly guess. The two of them sit on a stool. Today, the three-five are together. They meet in the plum blossom tent.</p>

<h3 id="e243">Is Wang Yin a Tough Guy? <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Mu</p>
<p>Someone said that Wang Yin is a tough guy, undoubtedly because he has played the so-called rough characters in various films he has starred in. Naturally, if you are seriously seeking evidence, I believe no one will be able to say why. In fact, this view is completely wrong. Wang Yin is not only not a tough guy, but simply a completely standard softie. What is the basis for this? Yes, the soon-to-be-released new film "Incarnation Girl" directed by Fang Peilin is the best irrefutable proof. Just watching him kneeling east and west in front of Miss Yuan Meiyun, Zhou Xuan, and Xu Manli is enough to make the soul feel indescribably refreshed and comfortable, as if sitting on a sofa chair. At the same time, it also admits that Wang Yin is indeed not a tough guy, but a softie in the completely opposite direction.</p>

<p>"New and Old Shanghai," written by Hong Shen and directed by Cheng Bugao, has long received our great attention. After a very smooth work progress, it was quickly completed in its entirety. On a rainy spring night, "New and Old Shanghai" was first tried at the Central Theater, and the audience who braved the rain to watch filled the seats, everyone with a feeling of excitement.</p>
<p>"New and Old Shanghai" won the audience's smiles with an interesting performance, but behind that interesting performance, there is a faint gray curtain, the most obvious being the ubiquitous depression, ah, depression. Zhu Qiuhen and Gu Meijun, a pair of dancers, often encounter dance customers who dance and slip away; Xie Yunliao is about to sell a piece of woodenware, and a few VIPs in a car come, but they are here to sell the woodenware in their home: The car driver You Guangzhao's boss went bankrupt and lost his job; Wang Xianqi, who served in a silk factory, also went bankrupt and lost his job; and the empty lane houses are being used to attract tenants with giveaways and discounts.</p>
<p>The story takes place between several tenants in a two-up-and-down house. In the detailed description, a large amount of interest is incorporated. The most obvious satire is the mysterious psychology of Shanghainese who pretend to be poor when they have money and pretend to be rich when they have no money. Wang Xianqi loses his job, but still pretends to be grand and eats "braised pork knuckles" and "tofu soup" with great spirit. But once he wins a second prize of 5,000 yuan in the aviation lottery, he immediately plans to pawn his clothes and move to the pavilion. He endures the desire for "braised pork knuckles" and "tofu soup"... But later, when the money shop collapses and all the deposits are lost, he becomes rich again...</p>
<p>As for the director, sound recording, photography, actors... the reader will definitely give them their trust, so there is no need to introduce them here.</p>

<p>(1) Difficulty in Visiting</p>
<p>There are many factories in Japan. We are not allowed to visit them. Only those related to military needs are allowed. We can only sigh at the door and look at the chimneys. Because under the management of the Military Industry Mobilization Law of the Japanese government, the government has the right to transfer or manage all military factories in wartime. Therefore, some factories are experimenting with converting to the manufacture of munitions or military supplies, preparing for wartime. They can immediately be turned into arsenals. Regarding how the government stipulates the temporary conversion of factories to the manufacture of munitions or military supplies, let's look at a few examples below.</p>
<p>Steel Chain Manufacturing Industry Conversion to Bullets</p>
<p>Various Industries with Drilling and Planing Equipment Conversion to Drilling Bullets</p>
<p>Piano Manufacturing Industry Conversion to Cartridge Cases</p>
<p>Engine Machinery Industry Conversion to Machine Guns</p>
<p>Various Chemical Industries Conversion to Explosives.</p>
<p>Explosives, Poisonous Gases, etc.</p>
<p>The Automobile Manufacturing Industry must be one of the industries within the scope. It stipulates the conversion to combat vehicles, armored vehicles, or armored trains in wartime. It is impossible to visit now. It was the Chinese Youth Association in Japan that pleaded with Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Fortunately, it was exceptionally allowed. The reporter then joined the Youth Association's visiting group and went to pay respect on the 14th of this month. There were 24 of us in total. We hired a car from Tokyo to Tsurumi in Yokohama. It took almost an hour to see the towering chimney of the factory from afar. Soon the car stopped outside the gate. Walking into the factory gate, rows of brand-new automobiles were lined up in front of us. At the same time, many cars were coming and going. Presumably, they were testing the newly manufactured vehicles. After detailed inquiries, we were finally led by the doorman into a large reception hall. After a brief refreshment, Mr. Adachi Kotaro, an engineer from the factory, came in to greet us. He first told us about the factory's general situation and manufacturing overview. Then he led us to visit the factory and explained everything in detail. We are truly grateful. The gains from the visit are arranged in order below.</p>
<p>Overview of the Factory</p>
<p>History In September of Showa 6 (1931), Tobata Casting Co., Ltd. merged with "Tato" Automobile Manufacturing Co., Ltd. In February of Showa 8 (1933), Tobata Ironware Co., Ltd. established an automobile manufacturing department. In December of Showa 8 (1933), Automobile Manufacturing Co., Ltd. was founded, inheriting the business of Tobata Casting Co., Ltd. In June of Showa 9 (1934), the company name was changed to "Nissan Motor Co., Ltd." Founded in December of Showa 8 (1933).</p>
<p>Capital A joint-stock company. The shares are fully paid up to ten million yen.</p>
<p>Main Factory Located on the reclaimed land in the second district of Moriyacho, Kanagawa Ward, Yokohama City (commonly known as Yokohama Shinkoyasu.)</p>
<p>Branch Factory Located at No. 1 Minami Onkajimacho, Taisho Ward, Osaka.</p>
<p>President Ayukawa Yoshisuke.</p>
<p>Managers Yamamoto Soji and Kubota Atsuketsuro.</p>
<p>Technicians Japanese are self-appointed. It is heard that the president of the company is a graduate of the engineering department of the Imperial University. He has rich experience in mechanical manufacturing. At the same time, he employs students who have studied in Europe and America to serve as technicians. There are no foreign technicians or consultants. Mr. Adachi Kotaro, who led us on the tour, is also one of the technicians. It is also heard that he worked at Chevrolet Automobile Manufacturing for eight years.</p>
<p>Products Small automobiles and automobile parts.</p>
<p>Production Rate 20,000 vehicles per year. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e248">The Results of the British Road Safety Campaign <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Mr. Leslie Hore-Belisha, Minister of Transport of the United Kingdom, recently made a radio broadcast in London. He claimed that as a result of the Ministry of Transport's road safety campaign in 1935, the number of lives saved from vehicle accidents exceeded 800. According to Mr. Hore-Belisha, although the average number of new cars added to the roads every day in 1935 exceeded 450, there were only 6,521 accident incidents, compared to 7,343 in 1934. The number of people injured in vehicle accidents was 281,798 in 1935, compared to 231,603 in 1934.</p>
<p>Minister of Transport Hore said that the accident rate per vehicle has fallen. This is the first time in many years that this has happened. From the statistics, in 1934, the number of people killed or injured in accidents per 1,000 vehicles reached 99. In 1935, the number decreased, and the number per 1,000 vehicles fell to 87. Therefore, Mr. Hore-Belisha hopes that the people of the whole country will work together to make 1936 a truly safe year in terms of transportation. Mr. Hore continued, "I deeply hope that public safety in 1936 will be one of the most outstanding tasks. The reduction in accident incidents in 1935 has proven that ordinary determination can save the country from many losses. The public in various places should pay attention to and promote various transportation facilities, such as traffic lights, pedestrian crossings, fences, and warning signs. But one thing that must not be ignored is that human attention is far more powerful than mechanical constraints."</p>
<p>Mr. Hore-Belisha also said on the night of the broadcast that the number of people listening to the speech in the air tonight should be no less than 2,500,000. He deeply hopes that the public can truly understand that if everyone pays close attention to various road regulations, their safety will be greatly improved. It is also heard that the Ministry of Transport is still planning to complete a larger number of plans. One of the plans is to forcibly instill road safety methods into the minds of school children as a compulsory subject in the curriculum. All schools in the United Kingdom will implement this plan. Although the number of people killed or injured in accidents in 1935 decreased by 800, Mr. Hore-Belisha believes that reducing the number by so much in the tens of thousands of casualties is still not satisfactory.</p>

<h3 id="e249">Miscellaneous Morris Snippets <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Australia has two famous passes. These are the Barry Pass and the Victoria Pass. Both passes are winding and exceptionally precipitous. People near and far all regard them as daunting routes. Recently, a Morris Twenty-Five model, under the supervision of the authorities, was able to safely pass through both places in top gear. The results were: climbing the Barry Pass in four minutes and one second, with an average speed of 33.064 miles per hour. Passing through the Victoria Pass took three minutes and ten seconds, with an average speed of 37.09 miles per hour. It is said that among British cars capable of such a feat, Morris is the foremost.</p>
<p>Mr. Lang La Taylor of Landtybosch, South Africa, told people: "I purchased my first Morris Cowley car in 1929. I drove it in Cape Town for transportation. Since then, I continued to use it until 1935. The total mileage reached 170,000 miles. Now this car is still being driven by another owner, and I have purchased a new 18-horsepower Morris car. The new car is extremely sturdy and beautiful to the utmost degree. Its many advantages are too numerous to mention. I love it. I enjoy using it, because it truly satisfies me." Mr. Baden of Lithgow, New South Wales, has been using Morris cars since 1925. He wrote recently saying: "In these eleven years, I have driven this vehicle and have never encountered any difficulty or trouble. And, apart from occasional tire punctures, I have not experienced any delays in travel that caused me to miss official appointments. I have been driving cars for 27 years. I have never seen a car engine more reliable than Morris."</p>
