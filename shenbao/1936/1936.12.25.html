<p>（南京）浙江省政府主席朱家驊氏爲出席中政會、於二十三日抵京、下午記者往訪、據談、浙省治安、絕無足慮、現有軍警、可資應付、惟財政困難、然亦非無辦法、能依適當步驟調處一切、建設工作、仍可充分進行云云、又承其發表時局談話如下、現在浙省人民官吏軍警所最關心的、是蔣委員長安全、與西安叛變的處置問題、當叛變消息最初傳到杭州的時候、民衆不免驚疑、到了政府採取極嚴厲的方針、人心纔定、大家以爲制裁張賊的辦法、只有用神速的兵力戡定他、張賊從沒有料到中央在委座蒙塵約期間、竟仍舊這樣安定、所以他擾亂中區的計劃是失敗了、到了中央立刻將他撤職交軍委會處置、加以各方聲討、繼以討伐令下、飛機轟炸開始張賊立刻現出各種恐慌的狀態來、如其放出蔣銘三先生飛京、就是恐慌的表現、此時恪遵中央决議、繼續施以大壓力、特別是用飛機、大規模轟炸其前方陣力、及其正在集中的部隊、實爲最有效的戡亂方法、如此一定能够搖其軍心、使他的部下的深明大義者、有反正的機會、儻使稍有遷循、便給張賊以打通共黨陣綫的便利、那末枝節就多、大局更不堪設想了，所以全浙民人、對於中央偉大的决議、是十二分擁護、同時對於軍事大壓迫的好消息、盼望得很切、我在報上看見委座十六日給何部長的手諭、實在無量的佩服、在這樣環境當中、仍舊保持平時光明磊落的態度、於體念人民疾苦之中、仍舊予張賊以自新的機會、幷且絲毫不苟、且眞是中國史中稀有的英傑、細看信中的語氣、明明表示此間各負責人同情中央迅速用兵的處置、幷主張迅速解决、手諭裏說星期六以前之不轟炸、不啻說過此以後之必須轟炸、來征「戎社」、也是這個意思、全國上下應該體念委座的用意、求其實現、積極進行軍事包圍、方不負委座光明磊落「母苟免」「不可奪」的態度、同時張賊要是稍有天良、稍微知道利害關頭、在此光明磊落的領袖反映之下、也應該得反省、一面打量自己兵力的强弱曲直、也應該要降服、以免徒然的犧牲、有的誤會、以爲操之過切、不無危險、殊不知惟有此堅决迅速的伐罪討逆的辦法、委座方能萬分安全出險、皆是正當的處置、我們試分析張賊的心理、最初是想「挾天子以令諸侯」、後來曉得沒有用、徒然遭了各方的痛罵、再加國軍四集、性命不保、末了便想靠委座做救命符、他决不敢謀害委座的、至於張賊之勾結共黨、分明是搗亂、其實紈袴子弟、平日以嫖賭過日子的人、根本同流市式的共產黨過漂泊生活的不能相容、講到鞏固中央、安靜地方、也靠中央用兵之神速、我在杭州、每天聽到中央軍事行動迅速的消息、到京後又知道中央政策及其行使之迅速與堅决、所以很安慰、深信張賊必能於再受攻擊與轟炸之後、會禮送委座回京的、（廿三日中央社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>言論界的團結問題</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>有組織的民意。是民主政治的動力所在。是外交軍事勝利的主要條件。要民意有組織。有力量。那負著領導民意同表現民意責任的言論界。非先有健全的組織。强固的團結。與密切的合作不可。中國在最需要健全輿論的現在。而輿論還沒有表現出必要的力量。最大困難。是言論界不能團結。最近。上海市記者公會舉行大會。有人主張邀請一切已登記的報社記者。加入該會爲會員。以健全記者團體的組織。這個建議是値得輿論界考慮的。</p>
<p>以領導社會代表人民爲職業的新聞記者。至少要有律師醫生及敎員一樣的職業地位。才可以保證職業的神聖和榮譽。我們不能否認目前以記者爲職業的手續。有時太不嚴格了。做了記者以後。受同業的監督程度也太不够了。在歐美國家。很少沒有健全的記者組織。這些組織的任務。是提高職業標準。改進記者生活。共同硏究記者應有的學問技術。及代表全言論界。與各界發生接觸。當然。歐美的記者組織。有純以記者爲本位的英美報業組織。有以國家利益爲最高原則的德意記者組織。此兩種組織。雖都有受人詬病的地方。但是就新聞界論。就全社會全國家論。有了這些組織。總比放任的時代情形進步些。</p>
<p>卽就言論最不自由的德國來說。德意志的新聞記者協會。據一九三三年德國新聞記者法的規定。有以全體監視各同人履行義務及保障各同人的權利之責任。凡是沒有加入德國新聞記者協會的。都不能在德國境內行使記者之業務。中央新聞記者協會。設法養成新聞人材。謀報界之共同福利。凡是新聞界有爭執事項。由恊會附設的職業法庭去處理。我們不能武斷這種組織。是希特勒壓迫言論界的工具。因爲在希特勒執政以前德國已有這個職業組織。德國新聞界在質量上所以有很高的成就。多半得力於健全的記者組織。英美諸國記者國體不單是求生活之改良。地位之提高。並相互硏究報業之改進。及對於某種問題。求共同之主張與見解。</p>
<p>在非常時期。意見總動員之準備。較軍事總動員與經濟總動員爲尤重要。因爲沒有民意與士氣。一切事是沒有力量去推動的。報業對國家負責最大。然而報業現在。不但無軍隊一樣的嚴格組織。運產業界一樣的輕度合作與團結。尙未做到。所以積極的爲改良新聞事業發揚民氣。消極的爲應付非常局面及澄淸報界。健全的組織乃是迫切之要求。這是報界所需要的。也便是他們所代表的中國四百兆人民所最需要的。</p>
<h3>泛美和會閉幕日　美國務總理宣布　新門羅主義　美洲團結共禦外來侵略　為全世界樹一和平楷模</h3>
<p>「非消滅戰爭卽為戰爭所消滅」</p>

<p>（東京）鑑於外交問題爲各派間所重視、故於二十四日之各派交涉會、有人主張由第二休憇室之田川大吉郞、於二十七日關於外交問題提出緊急質問者、交涉會未與承認、遂被擱置、政民兩黨對於外交問題、雖有相常程度之關心、然亦無提爲正式議題决定黨之態度之熱意、縱令以其他之方法質問政府之所信、然在議會假期以前、不致以緊急質問之形式質問外交問題云、（廿四日同盟電）</p>

<p>（紐約）本年美國耶誕節之繁榮情况、爲多年來所未有、全國郵務局之函件、其數之夥實前所罕覩、局中人員原有二萬、因公務忙碌應接不暇、故加僱臨時辦公員五千人、愆期之歐郵船多艘、均將於今夜或明日駛抵紐約、共載有郵包二萬七千件、郵務局將儘力於二十五日前送出、全國航空鐵路公路之運輸亦極擁擠、紐約居民多冒寒紛集各大商店購買物品、故各店莫不利市三倍、社會應酬漸復不景氣時代以前之狀態、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>干涉西班牙內戰　德國變本加厲　志願兵開西境有增無减　外艦數艘參加封鎖港口</h3>
<p>（倫敦）頃據消息靈通人士透出消息、西班牙叛軍所轄領土內、意大利人業已逐漸撤退、而德國人士則陸續入境、其人數益見增多、卽如國民軍所轄加第克斯港、十一月二十一日到有德國人九千名、二十六日又到有六百名、十二月六日則有德國容克斯廠所製飛機六架運抵該港、機上均裝有四十二米里密達口徑之砲、又聞現有外國軍艦數艘、改懸西班牙國民軍旗幟、參加封鎖巴塞洛那港之行動、卽如國民軍有巡洋艦一艘、卽「塞凡拉上將」號參加封鎖、但曾有人在同一時間、在不同之三處地方瞥見該艦、可見至少有兩艘、係由外國軍艦喬裝而用該艦之名也、此外據消息靈通方面接得報告、巴塞洛那港·伐朗西亞港·與瑪德里城三處地方、悉爲無政府黨所控制、蘇聯當局、僅與無政府黨合作、至與西班牙共產黨則並無聯絡、蓋共產黨在西班牙、人數廖寥、其聲勢亦不大也、共和政府所轄境內、間有在夜間四出殺害反政府派人士者、然均係不負責任之個人行動、至於共和政府當局、則曾盡其最大力量、以禁止恐怖行動云、據一般觀察者意見、西班牙全國人民對於外國干涉內亂、已深感厭倦、因此調停內戰之舉、在相當時期內或有實現之可能也、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>法國表示　嚴守中立　他國干涉不予停止　現行政策勢將變更</h3>
<p>（倫敦）泰晤士報頃登載巴黎訪員所發消息稱、法政府業已發出公吿、據云、不干涉西亂調整委會所提議各項辦法、俾不干涉恊定得以切實執行者、各關係國若不予以採納、則法政府卽當變更現行政策、此舉乃因德國干涉西國內戰日甚一日所致、並非該國共產黨宣傳運動有以促成之云、（廿四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）不干涉西亂調整委員會主席卽外務次官派莢茅斯勛爵、日前曾向各關係國政府詢問、關於禁止問接干涉西內戰一事之意見、（按所謂間接干涉、係指各國志願兵赴西班牙投效、及以金錢接濟內戰當事雙方而言）關於此項問題、法政府本日以覆文送達派萊茅斯、據負責方面所知、法政府在其復文中、縷舉該國現所採行之各項措置、並表示準備採取立法程序、藉以禁止間接干涉西亂行爲、但須俟其他各國亦在立法上採取同樣决定之後、法國政府方可照辦云、又謂法政府對於本國人民與外國人前往西班牙者、均擬加以取締、凡欲前往西班牙者槪須查明有正當理由、始可發給護照、此外、法政府並擬採取其他辦法、俾禁止以金錢接濟西班牙內戰當事雙方云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德對西行動　英感不安　盼德轉換態度　緩和緊張局勢</h3>
<p>（倫敦）德國經濟狀况極形惡劣、尤其食糧來源最覺困灘、外傳該國當局現擬計口授糧、此間政治經濟界人士聞訊餘、極感不安、深恐此種狀况日益嚴重、則德國干涉西班牙內亂行爲、或將變本加厲因而求一出路、亦未可必、關于此層、英京瞪券交易所市况、業已戚受影響、雖然英京負責方面、仍希望不干涉西亂不干涉辦法調整委員會現所進工之工作、能有以减削德國之干涉、從而避免巨禍之發生、此外、德國所提恢復殖民地一項主張、英國負責方面以爲、此項殖民地、有由英國加以統治者、乃受國聯會之委託、其移轉管轄、自非英國政府所可决定、以言原料重新分配問題、則其解决方案、實乃歐洲各項問題普遍解决之一部份、必如是英國乃可加以考慮云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）德國大使里賓特洛浦業於日前返國安渡聖誕節、此間政界人士甚望該大使返任時關、於禁止志願兵投効西班牙暨未來羅卡諾公約兩項問題、能携該國政府新訓令以俱來、俾國際時局趨於緩和、此在負責人士則謂英國政府正由外交途徑、向各國政府尤其是德國政府進行交涉、要求禁止志願兵投効西班牙、並聲明此舉乃維護歐洲和平所必需、關於此層、里賓特洛浦大使返國之前、卽曾與艾登外相討論及之、艾登外相當時曾謂、英國亟願解决歐洲一般問題、然據一般人所知、德國與他國成立諒解之最大障礙、端在侵略國如何下定義、曁侵略國如何予以指定兩項間題、綠德國所反對者、乃由國聯會加以决定也、此外政界人士並發表意見云、里賓特洛浦大使返任時、對於侵略國定義倘能携帶該國政府所提而爲各關係國所可接受之建議、則該國對於新羅卡諾公約與法俄兩國互助公約所持之反對態度、亦必隨之而趨於緩和、特此種辦法僅屬一種希望、未便過於樂觀耳、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>對德殖民地要求　法國所持態度　切實解决歐洲一般問題　作為交換殖民地之代價</h3>
<p>（倫敦）「泰晤士報」本日登載駐巴黎訪員發來消息就法國對於德國要求殖民地及不干涉西亂兩項問題之態度、有所論列、略謂德國若準備以切實辦法解决歐洲一般問題、作爲代價、以交換殖民地、則法國自當允許以殖民地畀予德國、反之德國要求殖民地若僅係標榜國社黨之聲威、則法國决定不作任何犧牲、要之、法國雖準備隨時舉行談判、以解决西歐問題、然若以殖民地問題作爲談判之階梯，而藉此以引起其他各項協定之討論則非法國之所願爲、在决國之意、德國應首先變更其政策、捨棄其威脅恫嚇而代以安全保瞪、捨棄其大規模重整軍備之計劃而代以軍縮及軍備監察、誠能如此、法國方可就殖民地問題對於德國有所讓步、惟法國此種讓步、、亦必須他國同時有所犧牲而後可、則以法國本非大戰後獲利最鉅之國家故也、且卽令德國對於世界各國不復有所要求、其在目前干涉西亂之一事、亦大足以促成戰事、此事性質重要、殊在其他事件之上、德國元首希特勒已迭次宣佈志在和平、則對於此項干涉行爲、自應竭力避免而後可、因此法國外長台爾博斯、聞已通知德國政府、謂德國對於西班牙叛軍倘變本加厲、而在實質上予以援助、則法國自未便始終採取不干涉政策云、此外、泰晤士報駐巴黎訪員並獲得可靠消息、足信法國外長台爾博斯業已訓令該國駐英大使戈爾平轉向英國政府建議、謂在目前英法兩國允宜聯合、向德國堅决聲明、該國若在實際上侵入西班牙、斷非英國所能忍受、英法兩國認爲德國此種舉動、乃係禍崇之端、其用意顯在變更歐洲地中海之軍略形勢、藉使未來戰爭中德國得佔先着、此種行動斷難促使英法兩國以若干土地畀予德國、俾該國作爲從事戰事之前哨、固甚明也、（二十二日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>新寰職業學校中學小學第二小學四週紀念特刊</p>
<h3>弁言</h3>
<p>— 張新伯</p>
<p>本校創立迄今，瞬屆四載。此四載中，幸賴敎育當局之指導與督促，社會人士之贊助與鼓勵，校董·敎職員及學生之勞力與合作，得有今日之成績。如擴充校舍，充實設備，添設部科，增加學級，提高學生程度，注意學生訓練，進行硏究工作，推廣補　敎育，雖艱辛締造，慘澹經營，但一切進行，莫不遵照預定計劃，决第實施，並經市敎育局立案敎育部備案，此新伯等所引爲白慰者也。</p>
<p>惟敎育事業，百年樹人，新寰前途，今方發軔，此後當益加努力，另行籌建校舍，繼續充實設備，並隨時代需要，力謀進展，以期更有貢獻於我國敎育前途，與夫民族復興也。莊子曰：「作始也簡，將畢也鉅。」是更有待於敎育當局之繼續指導與督促，社會人士之熱心贊助與鼓勵，及校董·敎職員。學生之加倍努力與合作也。</p>
<p>茲屆四週紀念之期，爰編印特刊，略叙本校渦去之情形，現在之狀况，及將來之計劃，以求正於當世賢達，亦所以紀念過去，策勵未來之意云爾。</p>
<h3>四年來之新寰</h3>
<p>— （張仲寰）</p>
<p>「新寰」自呱呱墮地以來，瞬將四易寒暑矣，茲乘四週紀念之期，爰就四年來進展情形，作一簡要之叙述，亦所以檢閱過去之實施，策勵未來之努力也。</p>
<h3>董事長江問漁</h3>
<p>（一）創校的旨趣</p>
<p>（一）學校敎育，宜力求普及；惟是我國學校稀少，入學兒童尙不及百分之二十。本校係以私資興學，補助國家敎育之不足。而謀敎育之量的發展。</p>
<p>（二）我國學校之適合標準，辦理完善者，竟寥若晨星，而以私立舉校爲允甚。本校目前因限於人力財力，雖不免因陋就簡，去理想標準尙遠，但總期逐步進展，成爲一理想完善之私立學校，而謀敎育之質的改進。</p>
<h3>創辦人兼校長張伯</h3>
<p>（三）敎育理想，敎學方法，必有賴於實地證騐，始克有濟。但公立學校，往往受時局之影響，爲法令所限制，不能有絲毫之自由；本校在國家敎育政策與法令規定之下，酌量伸縮，以期更能適應實情。並實騐敎育實際問題。</p>
<p>（四）中學畢業學生，往往缺乏相當之智識與技能，不能適應社會需要，而性行氣質，流入浮誇游惰；馴至學校多一畢業之學生，社會卽增一失業之份子，家庭即少一有用之子弟？將見敎育愈普及，而公私生活所受之禍害愈廣大。如欲實現敎育救國之主張，必須力矯此弊，提倡職業敎育，注重生產訓練，此本校所以有創辦職業學校之動機。</p>
<h3>創辦人兼校長張仲寰</h3>

<p>（三）物質的充實</p>
<p>（一）校舍之擴展　本校於廿一年度第二學期校舍在辣斐德路辣斐坊，非常狹小廿二年度起遷至派克路特　路口，並於附近增質寄宿舍二幢，二十三年度將派克路原址專辦小學，而將職校遷至監維藹路康悌路口，亦於附近增賃寄宿舍一幢，並增辦弟一小學。廿四年度又以該處狹小，不敷客納，更不能發展，遂將職校及二小遷至重慶路二七零號現址。第一學期又增賃威海衛路一一二號洋房一座爲小學低級敎室。本學期又自建禮堂一所，的可容七八百人。</p>
<p>校具之增置本校校具，爲應實際需要起見，逐年添置；一一十年度起因人數激增，添置更多。而於敎學用具方面，如新式鐵脚課桌椅，標準黑板，”鋼琴，風琴，中英文打字機，計算機，算學敎具，史地掛圖，自然掛圖，幼軍玩具等，萬為充實。</p>
<p>本校全體師生攝影之一部（因製　關係兩　截去一半）</p>
<p>（三）圖書之添置　本校圖書，除由創辦人捐贈二千餘冊外，並於每學期指定專欵，添置圖書。最近小學又定購小學生文庫，幼童文庫，小學生分年補充讀本小朋友文庫，小學各科　課本小世界等，職校復預的二十五史，叢書集成，萬有文庫第一　　　　二集，部叢刋，化　工業叢書，初中學生文庫，基本智識叢書等鉅著多部。</p>
<p>（四）儀器之增購　本校對於物理儀器，化　儀器藥品，博物標本等，原已粗具現模剮因增設高級，並添辦應用化科，故儀器藥品，添置史多，今後並擬分年增購，漸臻完備。</p>
<p>（五）實習之擴充本校自添辦商科以來，卽注意商業之實習，先後添設實習商店，實習銀行，商品陳列室，中英文打字室統計實習室等以供學生平日研究，練習，及實習之用；近年來又逐漸設法充實，商店，銀行，均粗具規模，商品陳列室更　分列國貨與外貨兩部，以供硏究及鑑別之用，中文打字　　　　　　機現有六架，英文　字機現有二十四架，今後每學期擬再增購若干架，以期學生練習之機會更可增加；該擬特的大公司及大銀行數處，俾學生於畢業前有實地實習之機會，（年來已在商務印書館及中華書局等實習，成績甚佳，備承讚許）。至於應用化學科方面，於二十三年秋卽與東方儀器公司合設工廠於南市高昌廟新肇周路，內分木工，鑄工，鍛工，鉗工，金工等工塲，以供學生實習。上年度校舍遷移，往返不便，除於畢業前在該廠作長時期實習外，並於校中另闢工塲一座，計分金木工及應用化學工塲兩部，所有　　　　工塲用具，亦逐添置，以期完備</p>
<p>（四）內容的改進</p>
<p>（一）提高學生程度年來各級學校，往往偏重於形式及活動方面，致學生程度，大有每况愈下之勢。故本校對於課程之編制，敎材之支配，敎本之選擇，旣非常注意；並預訂各科學程綱要，改進各科敎學方法，鼓勵敎師繼續進修；而對於成績考查，課外研究，敎學設備，以及修學指導職業指導等，允爲認眞；是以學生程度。逐漸提高</p>
<p>（二）訓練專業知能　本校職業學校，對於專業知能之訓練，特別注意。如注重實　　　　　習及練習，與行專業講座，舉行專題硏究等，務使學生於畢業後，有專門之知能，下足以謀個人之生活，上足以使國家民挨之復興。</p>
<p>（三）確定訓練目標本校深感敎育之範圍，不僅傳授智識而已，故平日對於學生訓練方面，非常重視。遍觀我國一般國民，愚昧無知，且大都具有「貧」「弱」「私」「散」四大通病；故本校訓練目標，卽培養生產知能，鍛鍊健全體魄，陶冶高尙人格，注重紀律訓練，以補救民生之凋敝，體格之衰弱，公　不修，精神之散漫；而於實施這際，復根據靑年及兒童之心理，注重人格感化，採取積極指導，以訓練健全之公民。</p>
<p>（四）培養愛國精神輓近以來，民氣不振，生活墮落，大半祇知自私自利，因循茍且，旣乏自信自覺之能力，復無犧牲奮鬥之精神，致國勢日弱，外侮日亟，民族國家，危在旦夕。故本校訓練兒　及靑年。無論敎學方面，訓導方面，均側重培養學生民族之意識，愛國之精神，務使成爲忠勇，奮發，犧牲，爲公之國民，俾能拯救國運，復興民族。</p>
<h3>大門</h3>
<p>（五）注重敎學硏究本校創設機，乃欲藉以從事於敎育之研究及實騐；顧四載以來，自愧尙無具體及圓滿之結果。近正對於課程，敎學，設備，訓練各方面，進行調查，參觀，討論，實騐等；並着手編肴新寰職業叢書，及新寰兒童叢書，民族英雄故事叢書等。</p>
<p>（五）今後的計劃</p>
<p>（一）另行籌建校舍本校中小學部校地尙不及上畝，校舍僅白數十間，現有九白餘學生，已感局促無地可容，故欲圖進展，非另行籌建校舍不可。今後擬將原有之職校曁二小校址專辦初中及第二小學，再於滬郊購地五十畝，籌建敎室一座，宿舍二座，禮堂一座，工廠一座，預計的二十萬元，可容千五百學生，俾成一較爲完善之職業學校。在購地建築未完成以前，仍須擴充校舍，以資發展。</p>
<h3>校景之一</h3>
<p>（二）充實必需設備本校對於設備方面，每學期均盡量添置；近年來以學生增加，所有桌椅，櫉櫃，圖書；儀器，以及商科實習用具，應用化農科實習工塲等設備，更大量增購，惟尙不足以言充實；今後仍須年撥鉅欵，並請求敎部補助費，專爲購置圖書，儀器及商科，應用化學科實習設備等之用，以期三年之內，超過部定標準，臻於完備之境。</p>
<p>（三）增設部科學級本校職中現有十一學級，今後擬添辦土木科，期達十八學級，使應用化學科商科及土木科均完成高初級六學級；初中各級均達三級共九學級；至新寰小學，擬逐漸增至十學級，卽初級雙級八學級，高級二學級；第二小學擬增爲幼稚國二學級，小學各年級均達三級，共二十學級；全部　額爲二千人。</p>
<p>（四）推廣補習敎育敎育係社會事業之一，學校之設施，應與社會打成一片，若閉門辦學，决非敎育之本旨。故本校對於推廣補習敎育事業，素甚重視，年來舉辦職業補習學校，如國語專修科，英語專修科，日語專修科，算學專修科，婦女補習科，店員補習科，中英文打字科，中文速記科等，所收學費，均極低廉。惟以致力於職中及小學之進展，致補習學校未能十分推進，今後須益加注意，以期推廣，力求普及。</p>
<p>雖然，一新寰經四年來之努力奮鬥，慘淡經營，由一低級之單級小學，而今且有幼稚園，第一小學，第二小學初級中學，及初高級職業學校矣；由一學級而今且有二十九學級矣；由二十餘學生，而今且有九百餘學生矣；由二敎員，而今且有六十餘敎員矣；進展之速，誠足驚人！惟敎育事業，乃　　　　百年大計，今後之發揚允大，俾稍有貢獻於民族國家者，更有賴於社會人士與校董之熱心贊助，及敎職員與學生之共同努力也</p>

<h3>紗花　三品紗暴漲停市　本紗跌後重回</h3>
<p>昨日紗市、初以賣方交貨踴躍、日本月份又爲最後之一幕、前日解入倉庫之紗三千五白包、據市塲中人云、昨日續解進三千七百包共計自七千包之多、市盤受其壓迫而拌、繼以中棉公司掃數接受、午後大阪現紗綫又在漲六·七元至十一·十五元、人心復爲其提高市價又見回昂、本月份氣勢則頗和平、末槃價爲二百六十三元、比上月價漲十六元九角、</p>
<p>紗價受日紗之影響</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、承上日收盤漲風之餘、且本月份爲最後一天營　、傳說交貨有四五千包之巨、然多方準備掃　收受、因此本月市態堅昂、漲一元三角、惟遠期較鬆動而跌、但大戶吸收之額、仍不放棄、故遠期跌勢尙平、現紗情形尙好、標紗結果本月比上日收盤價漲八角、其餘跌九角至二元四角、午後開盤、因本月交貨充足、市况甚疲、賣氣亦强、一致下跌、拍至三月期、已得大阪電訊期貨停市、現紗在漲六七元、綫漲十一至十五元、市塲震盪、多說東洋發行公價幾萬萬對於三品紗前途看漲、各月均漲八九角至一元外、迨至三收盤、本月平定、遠期稍疲、結果各月比上午收盤價漲四·六·九角、本月跌八角、查賣出裕大二千一百五十包、大豐一千五百九十包、振大五百包、合興一千五百包、望泰興一千一百五十包、長豐五千　五十包、大昶二千九百包、豐泰六百包、泰昌一千一百五十包、買進錦昌一千二百包、振大六百包、瑞大七百五十包、義成二千五百包、大昌成一千化百包、潤康三千九百包、協成一千一百包、恒昌一千二百包、福康七百五十包、賡豐二千包長餘八百包、愼記八百包、茲將一日間行市比較如下、</p>
<p>現紗銷路仍屬平淡</p>
<p>查全日各帮買去統計五百八十一包售價平平、各帮買額如下、</p>
<p>紗布新年例假五天</p>
<p>華商紗布交易听標準紗花市塲、茲屆國　年關市塲自二十五年十二月三十一日起至二－六年一月四日止、昭章休假、一月五日起照常營業、其年內各經紀人每日收付、自十二月二十六日起均用三十日期莊票結算云、</p>
<h3>連日跌價太猛　本月解進之花　空頭臨時抽回一半</h3>
<p>棉市轉昂、本月期爲最後一日、據市塲言、有外棧萬數干　之花、在四十二元左右抵進、業已收回不交解、於是籌碼抽少、市面轉緊復升、但現棉交易仍然岑寂、本月末盤價爲四十二元九角、比上月漲元七角、</p>
<p>沂月獨漲力角半</p>
<p>標花斬市開盤、本月份數後一日營業、據云有一部交貨二萬擔、因價跌後收轉不交解、同時英棉市情良好、人心允挺、但市塲交易不暢、標花結果本月比上日收盤價漲一角半、遠跌一角、午後開盤、隨紗市上升、同時本月空方收轉、半不解、本月轉挺、遠期帶好、結果各月上午收盤價均漲二三四角、查賣出裕大九千四百擔、振大一千一百擔、泰興二千九百擔、仁豐二千五百擔、潤康六千一百擔、長豐一千六百據、大昶二千一百擔、源興昌一千七百擔、聚興二千四百擔、瑞大一千三百　、長和四千二白担、買進吉豐二千八百担、大豐八千三百扣、合興三千一百擔、望泰興二千八百擔、明華二千二百　、長餘二千擔、仁豐二千一百擔、同和二千五百擔、生源二千擔、賡豐一千一百擔、愼記一千四百擔、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>粗細絨略有做開</p>
<p>現棉消費平常、廠胃不開、來源姚化一千八白包、通州花一千二百包、</p>
<h3>美棉之堅昂可見　雖有大宗賣出…行市仍漲</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤美棉之堅昂可見因利物浦消息良好，國外市塲堅昂、國內外同業買進、各月小組長　三到九磅音、旋因多頭了結、華爾街售出三月及五月期的三萬包、市價略回、此項售額、內有一半、係代廠家所出、惟均爲同業所吸收、塲中趨勢堅穩、外商購買遠月、近月因差價太巨、低級借欵棉花或將套出、形勢較軟、新戶缺乏、布市較活、收盤前、據報德美商的已有進展、大衆買進、市價上升、計現貨漲十二磅音、期貨漲十二至十九磅音、英棉現貨漲一點期貨漲二三點、印棉出口商及期貨商因日紗漲價、傾向買進、計平果爾漲跌〇·二五羅比、奧姍辣漲一·二五至一·五羅比、白羅溪漲一羅比、原電錄左、（二十三日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、二十四日開盤預測、白羅溪爲二百二十四羅比半、奧姆辣為二百　四羅比七五、平果爾爲一百七十一一羅比二五、均漲　·七五羅比、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋麥報價回升　標粉業外大批吸進　市盤昨亦回漲六七分</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份又呈激漲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥回漲二四五角不等、坎拿大漲四五角、利物浦漲一辦士、當開價時、本月份因係最後一月交易、　銷去胃、未見吒盛、故趨勢尙平、一月份爲廢歷年底、買戶較寂、漲勢而不甚疾、二月份以下、則因業外又見暢吸、開價即漲三四六分、以後交易仍暢、價呈盤旋、迨至下午開盤、本月份初出平靜、旋因客戶抽動、浮空又補、故續提二三分、二月份以下、因外行有巨額收進、曾續呈騰貴、如四月份又重出四元三局零二釐半、後則業中多頭脫手、稍見回軟、此種局面、純以洋麥報價爲轉移、故或漲或跌、國內市塲已失其定力云、</p>
<h3>遠期麥反漲亦勁　竟好一角以外　現貨未有做開</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份漲勞頗盛、因洋麥回漲、人心續俏、惟本月份因廠方現麥停進，人心尙定、遠期則以前日之跌勢太盛、兼之洋麥反漲、故交易雖稀、喊價卽提八分至一角不等、迨至下午開盤、交易已見暢、價續趨穩、較上午續好一二四分不等、現麥市面、仍無正式見交、因各廠方面、對江北一路之貨、祇還價六元五角半、客戶扳至六角不售、致相差五分、未有成交云、</p>
<h3>食米市况稍轉平定</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、共到百餘號、貨共二萬二千四五百石、內中薄稻有四十餘號、本街銷塲因雲南起義紀念關係、頗有動辦、包胃雖不見暢、但形勢似較前爲佳、計辦薄稻五千餘包、是以市况轉定、結果厚薄粳行情悉無榮辱、杜洋尖亦然、僅陰元供過於求、獨貶角許耳、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各地來源三十四五艘、市上各貨銷路依然平淡、惟白粳囤戶取巧稍辦、早市空盤、午市轉懈數分、早稱跟小五六分、薄稻價又見疲勢、白元小一角左右、羊埠杜尖價平疲、客尖價站定、其餘各貨價無甚上落、</p>
<p>今日為雲南起錢紀念日，南北米市雜糧麺粉紗花標金匯兌公債交易市塲，均休業一天，明日故無行市報告。</p>
<h3>客秈供過於求　市價又跌三五分至一角</h3>
<p>昨日客秈到頭仍旺、而消化淸淡、市面續見疲落、比之前市又見跌小三五分至一角不等、實因客化停頓、本銷不旺、而貨主與行囤頗有售意、且粵帮在湘省直接辦米已經中止、湘米產價回落後、來源勢必見肝、人心更爲軟弱矣、統市開出江西米一百九十包、湖南米九百三十四包、漢糙一千五百包、除湘砶靖三百五十包爲內地辦去外、其餘均由本衢應酬云、</p>
<h3>油市　豆油橫漲暴跌　比最高價慘落一元八九角</h3>
<p>豆油市况、自大連在漲後激成非常局面、因大連回修、人心軟化、致市擯持一星期未昨始由大連報升少許、因而跌開、統計成交廠油一百五十件、牛莊油二百件、大連油二百件、岐山油一百五十件、行情比前最高價慘跌一元八九角不等、（參閱市價攔、）此種橫漲暴跌、在現貨市塲中、實所罕見也、</p>

<p>昨日華商證券交易所、公債市塲、爲十二月份期貨之最後一日、趨勢因時局形勢晤淡、軋多甚稱猛烈、藍人　鑒於局勢混沌愈見萎疲、多方大戶均有戒懼、出　及掉期極爲踴躍、市價於枯滯檯面下、續見挫落、昨日上午開盤、檯面形勢頗形恍惚、大戶如十·四十五號等均多出售、　戶掉期甚爲踴躍、五十一·及十一號收買不少、市價均下降一角至四角半、乙甲遠期及丁種本月則好五分次盤多空仍忙於掉期、惟四十三四十五號　陸續有拗賣、五十號收買甚多、市價除甲種本月及戊下月跌落二三角、餘均同升五分至三角半、下午開盤、市况仍覺不振、十。六號籌續有實力賣出或掉期、丙戊種本月徵升五分、他如丁甲等一律降跌一角至四角半、收盤賣氣愈盛、四十七·五·十號等賣出仍極躅　、散戶亦有參頭掉期、市價軋多頗熾、均下跌五分至三角、全日結果、一律跌落一角至七角、乙種下月則好一角、成交總數、計一千二百八十七萬元、茲將其漲跌高低比較、列表如左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>

<p>晨開為一一五七元九角、較前收跌一角、大德成售條、退為七元八角、福與永鼎康同泰昌俱進、匯豐銀行掛牌揭曉英美俱平、逐漸升至八元四角、入後白銀平衡稅雖小二分、元茂永力購、反漲到九元七角散戶及生源永福興永洽豐永景福紛售、降爲八元、鼎康恒昌永大德成趁低納條、午收爲二五八元半、</p>

<h3>雨</h3>
<p>— 張春橋</p>
<p>雨是下得慢一點了，可是，起了風，雨點驚慌不安地往玻璃窗上撲，好像這麽一來，風就追不著他了。雖然，雨點很稀，聲音倒蠻大的。</p>
<p>屋里只有我一個人，寂寞地，不，好像有些苦楚似地，在給你寫這封信。</p>
<p>坐在椅子上，執著筆，我不知道先吿訴你什麽好。</p>
<p>窗子是向北的，在平常，就很暗，整天沒有一點陽光，屋角處不時向外散出潮濕的氣味，空氣沉重得不能向外流動似的，我不敢在這里多留一會兒；成天東跑西顚的，我希望能够多受一點兒陽光底照耀，比方，到附近的公園去，坐在草地上，看一看書，該是多麽適宜呢，對我這樣衰弱的身體。然而，你是知道的，那些書籍又敎育了我們，使你找這樣的人，不能够有一會兒的休息。爲了未來的永遠照耀我們的陽光。</p>
<p>這幾天，我實在支持不下來了，兩條腿走不多遠的路，就給誰拖著似的，走不動了。加上生活給我的磨難，他們勸我休息一下，在幾天的本閑里，寫一點文章，弄點踐，維持下個月的生活。我沒有作得好。我不願寫無聊的，有意義的却不能發表。這幾犬，我就盡所有的時間，讀平常沒時間看的書</p>
<p>可是，報紙上的消息擾亂了我，使我不能安心。</p>
<p>今天，夜裏就落雨了。我這屋里，暗得要命。好像世界上就沒有了光，潮濕的氣味很濃厚地擁擠在我底四周，想把我壓死似的。</p>
<p>我想出去。皮鞋是早破了，在這冷天，從柏油路，黃泥路上滲進鞋里的冰冷的水和泥沙，我怎樣抵禦呢？再說，到哪兒去呢？</p>
<p>這會兒雨又瘋在地呼嘯起來了，跟風攪在一起，凶暴地往大地冲擊。在初冬，輕易碰不到這樣兒的雨的。好像要把世界毀滅，不，要把一切齷齪的東西洗刷乾凈，連我心里的苦悶也冲走。</p>
<p>周圍被壯烈的交嚮佔有了。</p>
<p>我聽不到另外的聲昔。</p>
<p>我底注意力整個兒被暴風雨抓住了。</p>
<p>屋門什麽時候開的，我不知道。</p>
<p>「彭先生！」</p>
<p>呌我的是一個糢糊不淸的影子，他底聲音是提高了的，彷彿跑了一段長路，嗓子里給東西擋住了怎麽的，有些沙啞，又有些戰抖。聽起來，好像很熟悉，却又不記得這是誰底聲音。</p>
<p>我扳一下電燈底開關。</p>
<p>是沙？</p>
<p>她穿著那身穿久了的，深藍色的夾袍，雨淋得變成黑色了。臉上的水珠發亮地向下墜，頭髮死貼在一起，有一綹就沉重地垂在左耳旁的頰上。那一對閃著火一樣熱的光芒的眼睛注視著我，等到我驚愕地望她的時候，微笑了！</p>
<p>「雨這麼大，你……」</p>
<p>「很奇怪嗎？」</p>
<p>她說著，一邊解她底衣服。我從箱子里取出我底一身破棉袍來遞給她，她擺擺手，向我床上躺好，拉過棉被來蓋上。</p>
<p>我把椅子拖正，向著她　。</p>
<p>她側著身子，兩隻手放在被子上，面部露在外面，頭髮潮濕地披散在枕頭上。很疲倦了的樣子，休息著。</p>
<p>我很驚奇她怎麼知道我住在這兒，而且，在在風暴雨里，穿著單薄的衣服跑出來。</p>
<p>我認識她是在一個學校里，在第一次上課的時候，我就發覺到她是一個有才能的人，她底豐饒的天才，還是一塊剛剛開墾的處女地。她學習的成績使人吃驚，我簡直不相信她沒有求學過，或者過去不曾會說北方話。她在很短約期間里，已經可以寫得流利，優良的文章，講很正確的北方話了。</p>
<p>可是，這是四個月以前的事，從她在學校裏畢了業以後，我沒有再見過她。只聽別人說，她已經敎別人，而且有著很好的成績。還聽人說，她想找我談一决話，來解决她底幾個疑問。</p>
<p>但是，我們一直沒有見面。</p>
<p>今天她底突然地來臨，我怎麽不驚奇呢？</p>
<p>我望著她。她眼睛注視著天花板，靜靜地沒有一點兒聲音，好像在回憶著一段故事或者戀愛的夢境。</p>
<p>「你從那裏來？」</p>
<p>「我正要吿訴你。」她停了會兒。「你沒有從報紙上得到消息嗎——外面很緊張呀！」</p>
<p>她底臉上激動地浮著一層光。她底聲音好像用力壓著，發出的却仍舊很大，風雨底呌號從外面擁進來，想把它掩沒似的。</p>
<p>「你關上窗子好嗎？—風太大了……」</p>
<p>「好的，你說下去，」</p>
<p>我回身關上窗千，屋里就顯得寂靜下來，只能聽到逮處呌囂似的風雨聲。</p>
<p>我望著她興奮的樣子，沉默着。</p>
<p>「你怎麽想到我這里呢</p>
<p>？」</p>
<p>「沒有地方去，記起你來了。」</p>
<p>「因爲你是我們先生呀！我們時常談到你，有什麼事情更時常往你身上想，我們總希望得到你底意見，這些時，你不去了，我們更容易想起你，—可是，你底身體好些嗎？」</p>
<p>她底音調平穩而且淸楚。兩隻天眞的眼睛笑着。等我向她點點頭，她才放心地沉默住了。</p>
<p>我望望窗外，燈光射出去，把雨絲分得淸淸楚楚的，好像千萬條棉繩，隨風剪碎了，墜到地面上，消逝了　。</p>
<p>我還沒有棉衣，沒有過冬的一切準備。然而，她的那種熱情，我的煩悶都經不起道熱流地溶化，我底健康也好像復原了。</p>
<p>明天，我就恢復我底一切。</p>
<h3>晨</h3>
<p>— 高爾基作　任鈞譯</p>
<p>世界上最有意思的事情，就是——看見一天是怎樣地誕生出來的。</p>
<p>太陽最初的光亮在天空裏燦然輝耀，黑夜的昏闇悄悄地躱進到山谷裏和岩石的裂痕裏去，躱進到林木的葉叢和滿披朝露，恰似在編着花邊的草叢裏去，這時候，各處的山頂就很慈和似的微笑着，好像對着溫柔的夜影這麽說：　「不要怕——這是太陽公公啦！」</p>
<p>海波高抬着白頭，像宮廷的美女們，朝着自己的君王一般地，向太陽行禮，歌唱</p>
<p>「世界的主人喲，我們歡欣地迎接您！」</p>
<p>和靄的太陽笑着。這些波濤們已經滾來滾去的遊玩了一整夜；現在，頭髮已經弄得很凌亂了，綠色的衣裳也弄皺了，天鵝絨的裙裾也弁得纠纏小淸了。</p>
<p>「日安！說着，太陽就昇到海面上來。「日安，美麗的諸君！但——已總够了，給我安靜些吧！要是你們權續跳躍得那麽高，孩子們不是不能够洗澡了嗎！我們不是非讓地上的一切都過得舒舒適適不可嗎？」</p>
<p>綠色的蜥蜴們從岩石的裂痕裏跳了出來，閃着惺忪的眼，彼此攀談着。</p>
<p>「今天會熱起來啦！」</p>
<p>炎熱的日子，蒼蠅們就會憂悶地飛舞，蜥蜴們要捉牠們來吃是很容易的。吞食美味的蒼蠅，乃是——頂高興的事體！原來蜥蜴是——非常講究吃喝的呢！</p>
<p>花兒濕濃濃地含着露珠，用詼諧的恣態互相搖曳着，好像在調弄般地說着這樣的話：</p>
<p>「老爺，請你描寫下來吧，大淸早我們裝飾着露珠是怎樣地美麗！諸你望着我們，把各種花兒的小照，用文字描寫下來吧，請你試試看吧！那是很容易的事體——我們是這麽單純的東西……，</p>
<p>這些小計般的小鬼頭們！他們完全曉得：人是不能够把他們的可愛的美麗用文字描寫出來的——他們在笑着！</p>
<p>我恭敬地把帽子脫下來，對着花兒們說：　「你們的懇切，眞使人不敢當。謝謝各位的美意——但我此刻沒有工夫，以後大槪……。」</p>
<p>當花兒們把手脚伸向太陽，好像誇耀地微笑着的時候，太陽的光綫就照耀着露滴，在花瓣和靑葉上面鏤着鑽石般的光輝。</p>
<p>這其問，在花上，已經有着一大羣，一大羣的黃余色的蜜蜂，好像很貪婪似地吮吸着甘蜜。並且，牠們的低而粗的歌聲還在暖和的空氣裏面流動着：</p>
<p>慶賀快樂的生命之源的陽允，</p>
<p>慶賀美化大地的功業</p>
<p>紅胸脯的知更雀醒過來了。用瘦小的雙足站着，搖擺着身體，也在唱着自已的，沈靜的，歡欣的歌兒。——烏兒比人邊更加曉得：住在地上，是一件多麽寫實的事體。知更雀無論什麽時候都最早出來迎接太陽。並且，因爲這小烏的小胸脯上的羽　，還給朝該的光彩所煊染，所以，在遙遠而寒冷的俄羅斯，還鳥就被稱做「曉星一。在樹叢裏，那快活的，綠灰色的烏兒正在跳來跳去。這鳥兒很像街頭的孩子們——非當暴躁，不管呌喚多少時候都不會感到困倦。</p>
<p>燕子們全然跟黑箭般地輕快地交飛着，追趕着小蟲，很快意般地，很幸福般地呌喚着——具有輕快的翼膀，是寫意的。</p>
<p>笠松的枝兒在顫動着——笠松正像一個大酒杯；滿溢着黃金色的酒漿似的太陽的光亮。</p>
<p>此刻，人們也醒過來了。他們的全部生涯都是——勤勞；生都在裝飾，豐富這地面——但，從生到死，他們自身仍舊是一個窮人。</p>
<p>爲什麽呢？</p>
<p>你如果想要曉得個中的理由，等將來長成之後，你就會明瞭。此刻——你愛着那一切喜歡和力量的根源的太陽就行。而且，正如太陽對於一切都一視同仁般地，你也盡量慈愛和快活吧。</p>
<p>人們醒過來了。然後就出去耕種，出去勞働——太陽望着他們，微笑着。人類在地上做了怎樣多的好事情：它比誰都還要知道。太陽　覩大地曾經是一片沙漢；如今，大地已經完全給人類——我們的父親，祖父，曾祖父的偉大的工作，給重要的，小孩子所不能理解的東西所掩蔽着。他們還在地上創造出各種玩具和各種愉快的東西——其中，特別是像電影那樣的東西。</p>
<p>啊啊，我們的祖先，他們曾經好好地勞作過。所以，我們應該愛惜，尊敬那些在我們的周圍無論什麼地方都有着的，他們所做下來的偉大的工作。</p>
<p>年幼的人們啊，你們不妨試行想想這件事情——叙述人類怎樣在地上勢作的章話，乃是——世界上最有趣味的故事……。。</p>
<p>野籬上，薔薇緋紅，到處都有着她的花兒在破蕊，而一般的花却已經凋殘了；但還在凝視着靑空，凝視着黃金色的太陽。那天鵝絨般的花瓣，搖擺着，發出甘美的香氣，在充滿着芳香的，碧綠的，暖和的大氣當中，靜靜地漂流着柔和的歌聲：</p>
<p>縱然凋殘了</p>
<p>美麗的還是——美麗</p>
<p>縱然死滅了</p>
<p>可愛的還是—可愛呀…</p>
<p>一天又來到了。</p>
<p>日安，年幼的人們啊！但願各位的生涯裏有着許多的好日子！</p>
<p>我一邊寫着這，一邊却感到寂寞。</p>
<p>從前的小孩，已經到四十歲了，但什麽工作都沒有做。—他是有點感到寂寞的。</p>
<h3>從四妹出嫁想起</h3>
<p>— 陳毅</p>
<p>昨天收到了父親的一封信說四妹十月初三要出嫁了。讀了這個消息，除了嘆當兒子的不能替老父分一點勞而外，一個人靜了好一陣才吐出一口氣來。</p>
<p>『四妹呵！又一個犧牲者。』</p>
<p>四妹還有暈病的，暈病一發，什麼都不知道了，然而因爲父親爲一家仔生活常年在外間奔跑，母親又是一個病弱的身軀，兩個大的妹妹已經出嫁了，小妹妹又是不知事的七歲的孩子，所以家裏的一切事都落在四妹身上。她管着油鹽柴米，她管着一家人的換洗衣裳，還管着支人待客，我去年回家要一根綫也要向她要，母親就常說妹妹小，我又沒接媳婦，四妹一天出嫁怎麼了？所以四妹的婆家好幾次來討年庚，，母親都堅持不發，爲的就是這個。</p>
<p>但鄉下人常說的，「女生外相」，女兒家大了終歸是要嫁的。讀了父親的來信，照理應該是要歡喜，應該是要慶視自己的妹妹，然而我的確是難安極了，我想起了我已出嫁的兩個妹妹。</p>
<p>在我們那末一個崇山峻嶺的家鄉被人家當着沒有開化的家鄉，女兒們的未受敎育，是司空見慣的事。我的家旣不是特殊階級，妹妹當然也不會讀書了。自己旣沒有自由選澤婚姻的自山，當父母的又是限於自身所處的時代，所以對於兒女婚姻的包辦，是無可如何。雖然這包辦也經過鄭重選擇，但畢竟因爲是包辦，結果就不會好　。</p>
<p>大的個妹妹嫁給一個農家的兒子，妹夫說是贖過幾天的書的，但却不願上進，寗願去作什麼團體的事情。妹妹是一個個性很强的人，看看自己的哥哥能够跑北京，跑上海，想自己的丈夫也能够這樣，但是假定自己的丈夫眞一天這樣了，到外間找一個女人，就拋去她，這，她釗反沒有想到。</p>
<p>新婚的初夜，像被禽獸蹂躪一樣，不會反抗，禮敎之給她，這是人倫，應該忍受的。受孕，生孩子，婆家怕沒奶請奶媽花錢，第一天生下孩子就擠奶，按照生理常識講，產婦是要第三天才來奶的，終於擠成了一個奶瘡，半年醫不好。</p>
<p>生瘡沒人管，回家來醫，當我看見母親給她扯濃頭的時候，我眼前立刻顯現一個陰影，我的身上不禁冷顫起來，我幾乎要呌出來了。</p>
<p>母親弓着背，我掌着燈，妹妹坐在椅子上，當母親的手一觸到瘡口，妹妹就慘呌一聲，這慘呌特別打動我的心坎，像針在刺。鄉下的醫生可是那樣的令人想也想不到，把一束不知呌什麼名的草擱在灶頭上烘，也不敷在瘡口上說就可以醫病，這眞只有天明白。想買點什麼最普通的西藥，就好像海裏撈針一樣，眼看着妹妹一天天的瘦下來了，瘡口老是收不攏，母親焦得飯都吃不下去了。</p>
<p>但是那個當丈夫的，好像沒有這回事一樣，一直等到托人到城裏去買了藥來，根據我自已的一點醫藥常識來治，慢慢的减輕了。可是妹妹的頭髪已經落了一半，瘦得脫了人形。我離開家第一决得到父親的信，就是說妹妹的事的。</p>
<p>「菊女病已好，惟家巳分炊，××未讀書，不知事，可嘆！菊女亦苦命人矣。」</p>
<p>我還能說什麼呢？</p>
<p>第二個妹妹，嫁給一個中學畢業的人，丈夫雖吃大烟，也賭錢，也宿娼妓，所幸他對妹妹還好，但這好是有緣因的，爲的他有後娘。</p>
<p>後娘刻待妹妹，妹妹如何低聲下氣，總得不到後娘的歡喜。除了跟大的個妹一樣也受孕生孩子而外，這個妹妹的身體要健康一點，人也忠厚一點，所以她還能安然處下去，但她每天從早上一起米，燒飯，喂豬，七洗衣裳，一直到睡才能沐息。</p>
<p>我離開家的時候，妹妹是道樣的過着，想從婆家來送送我的行，都沒有得到允許。今後十年，二十年，以至於死，如果社會還是和今天一樣，妹妹的處境恐怕不會有半點改蠻的。</p>
<p>想到這兩個妹妹的遭遇，對於十月初三出嫁的四妹，我眞爲她可憐，我邊看信邊想，我自己雖想出了緣因，而且深信這緣因，但我難過</p>
<p>想到在萬里之外，一個鄉間，一幢房，一間小屋子，一個粗魯的大漢擁抱着一個純眞的女人，在敦所謂人倫，我的眼前發黑了，陰影在我的眼前顯現出一個，兩個，三個……</p>
<h3>告辭</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>薄暮的練湖</h3>
<p>— 千冬</p>
<p>獨　牙牆　客程，</p>
<p>殘年風景促鄉情，</p>
<p>寒天半夜無人語，</p>
<p>明月滿船　雁聲。</p>
<p>雲外好山如有約，</p>
<p>烟中野樹不知名。</p>
<p>來朝烏鵲橋頭閙，</p>
<p>應是人家出迎戶。</p>
<p>——薩都刺：臘盡過練湖。</p>
<p>故鄉給與我的印象本來是非常淡薄；尤其是這幾年來，無論自己到什麽地方去混日子，背後總是拖着長長的一絛尾巴：母親，妹妹，妻子，孩子，我的故鄉是跟着我走，我到處不愁沒有聽到故鄉的硬重底語音，我時刻可以看到家庭的零亂底什物，故鄉與我是更沒有什牽眸了。</p>
<p>今年，我的故鄉突然遷移到丹陽來了。</p>
<p>丹陽是過去騷人墨客所歌頌的地方。這條古老的運河的旁邊，有唐張又新所評定的天下第四泉的丹陽觀音寺底玉乳泉，在那裏，詩人常歌詠着：「汲來玉乳泉堪煮，坐月談空欲共僧。」而玉乳泉對面的練湖，更是他們所嚮往的地方，什麼「淡淡輕波細細風」，什麽「正是月明茶又熟，隔湖聽唱採菱歌」，這些，都是從詩人的湖上小艇裏盪漾出來的淸歌。</p>
<p>今天傍晚，下了課以後，我想抖去身上的疲倦，獨自個兒也沿着運河走過去。運河的兩岸已經沒有像李太白所說的那樣「兩岸饒商賈」，現在却一切都像沒落了。那污濁得和泥水一樣的河水上，只有幾個老頭兒在捕着魚；那荒凉得各處都是枯草的堤岸上，三三五五搭著着江北人的草棚。</p>
<p>北風像要呑人一樣的張着嘴怒吼，走過堤岸，風彷彿吹得更兇了我。縮着身子，走到湖邊</p>
<p>黑暗宛若幕一樣的垂下來，廣大的湖面像罩着一層黑色的面紗，陰沉沉的波浪洶湧着，啪唦地擊撞着湖邊。看看天空，也滿佈着烏雲，大槪是快要下雪了。</p>
<p>當然，我沒有雅土的幸福，到這湖畔上來品茗；而且我也沒有聽隔湖山歌的性情。我却只希望能够看看廣大湖面上的明鏡一般的水。可是，黑暗很快地垂着，洶湧的波濤依然啪唦啪唦地衝着。</p>
<p>在這破殘底時代和這破殘底年與日的角邊上，在這廣大底黑暗底天空和這廣大底黑暗底練湖的角邊上，一個永遠想不到故鄉的人，現在却想起需要有一個像故鄉那樣的處所了。</p>
<p>薩都刺，你的船是從這裏過去的，請你吿訴我，我將停泊在那裏才好呢？</p>
<h3>紀德的「新的菓子」</h3>
<p>— 荃麟</p>
<p>當米非斯特要去誘惑浮士德的時候，天帝對他說：</p>
<p>「枝葉已繁盛，便是園丁也知道，</p>
<p>來年將有花菓的收成。」</p>
<p>但是浮士彼終於沒有收穫到他的菓子。米非斯特勝利了。浮十德便以悲劇而結束。</p>
<p>歌德以偉大的熱情，去追求現實矛盾的解决，去追求一個完全的人格，但當他寫完浮士德以後，他對　Eckerman嘆息說：「這不是人力所能及，去解决世界的問題；他只能找出問題從什麽地方開始，而停留於他可能理解的界限之內。他的機能不允許他去了解自然的活動。他以有限的展望，想去理解宇宙，是徒勞的事。人神之理是兩種截然不同的東西。」當這一位偉大的詩人漸漸老去的時候，他終於感釗疲倦了。</p>
<p>歌德的煩悶，正是十九世紀中許多偉大藝術家的煩悶。他們憑着偉大的天才，認識了現實的矛盾和醜惡，但却我不到一條解决牠的出路，他們想找求一個滿足的生活，但却感覺在這現實世界中無從找到；於是他們傍徨，苦悶，而不知所從，終於躱入到唯心論或宗敎的懷抱裏，以求得慰藉—這差不多成爲十九世紀的文藝中一種代表的調子。</p>
<p>在現在，我們從歷史上看來，可以了解這些偉大的藝術家爲什麽不能找到他們的出路。這不是由於他們天才不够偉大，而是他們的歷史時代限制了他們。當他們生在一個以個人主義爲基礎的歷史時代中，而從個人主義的方法上去找求這一時代的出路，正如歌德所說是徒勞的。</p>
<p>我們應該感謝生在現在這個時代，我們不僅從理論上，並且從實際上，看到了人類新的前途。從個人主義的歷史泥土中開出來的新社會制度的花，把前人所不能解决的問題答覆了。一個自由的，沒有壓迫的社會，在我們的展望之中，從那裏我們可以我到一個完全的人格，我到人類眞芷的幸福。但是這個新時代却還沒有到來——也許離開我們還有相當的距離。這需要我們用更艱苦，更堅决的努力去達到牠，在這樣一個艱苦的奮鬬過程中，我們是可能遭遇到更大的苦悶與失望的。我們將怎樣去克服這些苦悶（這可以說，是現代靑年一般的苦悶）呢？紀德的「新的菓子」（Les　Nouvelles　Nouritures　一九三五出版）給予我們一個明確的答覆。</p>
<p>我們將以怎樣態度去面對這現實呢？作者吿訴我們：</p>
<p>「抬起你低俯着的頭。抬起你回墳墓中下視着的眼睛，不要抬得太高，去望那渺茫的天空，而是向地平綫上望去。同志，大膽地，更生地，準備離開這被死屍的毒菌所腐化着的地方，走向你的脚步引導你去的那裏去。讓你的希望推動你向前。別讓你被對於過去的戀慕所拉回去！向未來而前進。從你的夢想中去找求詩，已經够了；現在要懂得向現實中間去找，假使那裏沒有，那末，你目己去創造牠牠」</p>
<p>是的，去創造牠。人類是受現實所决定的，而同時也是創造現實的，我們將怎樣去創造新的現實，道不是在僩人主義的圈子所能解决的。我們需要有一個新的人生觀：</p>
<p>「懂得去獲取那使哀訴成爲無用的東西！不要去向別人乞求你自已所不能獲得的東西。</p>
<p>「……把你的快樂去建築於爲衆人的快樂的創造上。工作，奮鬬，和不去接受你所不能改變的瓖的事物。要懂得去反覆這一句話：一切事情全靠我自己。人們去低首於人們自己所引起的罪惡，這是卑怯。不要再想—假使你會經這樣想過——馴從是聰明，否則，就不要再去向這種聰明乞靈。</p>
<p>「同志，不要去接受別人給與你的生活。繼續去追求你自己，那使生活能改善——這是我們的生活，你的生活和衆人的生活；不是人們所說的那種能給我們現世生活一種安慰的未來生活，那呌我們去忍受不幸的。不要去接受牠！當你知道了這是人而不是神，應該負責生活中的一切罪惡時，你將再不會去屈服於罪惡了。</p>
<p>「不要對偶像去再作任何犧牲。」</p>
<p>把你的快樂去建築於爲衆人的快樂的創造上，這是最重要的一點。你的快樂和衆人的快樂是不能分離的。人們要滿足他自己，只有當衆人能滿足他們自己。這不是依靠於浮士德式的博學，而是應去懂得獲取一使哀訴成爲無用的東西」——鬬爭。造出一切罪惡的是人們自己，而不是神，人們就應該不屈服於一切罪惡。人們要達到他們所快樂，必須要有勇氣去破壞這罪惡的社會的表皮。相信你自己的力量，去和一切偶像，一切壓迫人類的事物去繼續鬬爭。從鬬爭中去改造現實，創造現實。只有用這樣的代價，才能達到人類眞正的幸福，才能獲得人類眞正的解放，才能創造出完全的人格，人類才能征服自然，才能獲得所謂愛的無限制擴大」。</p>
<p>紀德的「新的菓子」是經現實的泥土中生長出來的。牠沒有一絲玄學的氣味（雖然道個園丁却會一度是忠實的基督主義者），牠是靑年人一件寳貴的體物。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>中學爲體西學爲用</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>中國的社會，是一個極古舊的，保守的但又帶矛盾性的社會，爲證明我這話的不是瞎說，就請拿醫生來談談。</p>
<p>中國的醫學，據說發明甚早，自從神農嘗百草之後，幾千年來，經過多少名醫的經騐，又發明了陰陽九行之說，　種玄理，頗使一般人莫測高深。最近百年，因海通之故，中國人知道所謂「天下」也者，除了「華夏」之外，也還有並不是蠻夷之族的國家，而中國人的疾病，在感到華陀不能再世之後，碰到沒有法子時，也只好去請敎西醫。事實上，也是因爲有這樣的需要，學西醫的人，才漸漸地多起來。到了現在，西醫的業務，漸漸地發達，病家對於他們的信仰，也因了事實而增加了。</p>
<p>在大城市中，中醫與西醫，已經山對立的形勢，變成一個壓迫，一個退議的地步，這退讓的一方並且感到有點支持不住的樣子，於是覺到對方某種利器的厲害，自己也去倣造起來。但是不幸得很，醫生的資任，是救生而不是殺生，用西醫的方法去抵抗西醫，非但抵擋不住，而且對於病人，往往有枉死的危險。我會經遇到一些病家，他們爲傳統的觀念所拘　，以爲某些病，中醫不行，醫如外科，那是必須請敎西醫的，但某些內科症候，卻又非中醫小可，他們大抵相信「中學爲體，西學爲用」的名言，對於醫藥，也相信只有中西兼治。然後才可以把病治愈的。有些病家，往往吃中醫的藥，打西醫的針，以爲這樣中西兼治，病是會好得快的，但也有中西醫都束手的時候。</p>
<p>一方面，因爲病家有這　的需要，一方面，爲顯示自己的聰明，於是　醫　有自己兼行打針的，如退熱針，血淸針之類。某些巾醫竟自己帶了藥來，不必西醫再費心了。但　針打下去之後，對於病人，有沒有反應，反應的程度怎樣，以及對於身體其他各部有沒有損害，那就不得而知，病家在這種情形之下，便只有聽憑天命了。</p>
<p>最近報上就有一中醫　　冒用西藥，及西醫醫療器械，曾山前衛生部通令查禁，本市衛生局，鑒於少數中醫，仍有濫用西藥及注射器爲人冶病者，，特通令各中醫團體，均切遵照禁用，並隨時派昌查察，以資取締，而重民命…云」。如果不是對於病人的生命有過威脅，衛生局是不會呌他們「而重民命」的。我這樣的提出，倒並不是反對中醫，中醫雖然有它幾千年的歷史，但因時代的高速度進展，它是無法挽回它的刦運的。時至今日，因交通的發達，機械的普遍，一些都會上特有的病症，中醫不僅醫不好，並且速致病的原因，也無法得知。因爲在古醫書裏，並沒有　樣病名的存在，　們便只有瞎猜「候症了，舉一個眼前的例來說吧，「癌」之成因，歐美日本各　的「癌」專家，到現在還尋不出它的眞正原因來，所以西醫遇到癌，便只有束手無策的，而我們的中醫，據說是有法治愈這　毛病的，可是黃膺白先生，畢竟是死了。</p>
<p>這些話全是事實，而且沒有一點意氣，，沒有一點輕視中醫的地方，我以爲中醫到了這個時候，應該承認自己方法的不够，與認識的不健全，而以「知之爲知之，不知爲不知」的熊度去對付病家，病家呢，相信中醫和西醫都可以，但不要誤信「中學爲體，西學爲用」之說，而杜作主張，截長補知起來，因爲醫藥並不是兒戲的事，而且天下的眞理，也到底只有一個呀！</p>
<h3>梅花</h3>
<p>— 孟華</p>
<p>是冬天了，照時序講，現在也快到了「大雪」的時節。但在這江南的上海，但只能見到小小的雪珠，雜在牛毛一樣的「秋淋」　。在這時候，我就時常懷念着北方，懷念着北方那皎潔如銀的白雪。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>今天一早，剛醒來時，窗外却朦着一片濛濛的白霧，天色像鉛一樣陰沉。我以爲該是降雪的時候了，想不到過了一二刻鐘，外面却響起了淅瀝的雨聲，開窗一望，正像北國暮春的氣象，知道下雪又是無望了。住在這渾濁的都市裏，我們與自然是隔離得太遠，太遠了。</p>
<p>並不是我有了重裘或是溫暖的家，才愛着雪。我是從雪得到安慰的。一看見一片片的在空中飛舞着的雪，我就像置身故鄉一般，感到滿足了。但現在，外面正淋着雨，我不禁寂寞起來。</p>
<p>在雨滴的旋律裏，都市的囂聲是遲鈍的。枯坐在凄冷的房間裏，我想起了幾年前的往事來了。</p>
<p>是在大雪新晴的一天淸晨，我們起身的時候，一打開窗，便看見階前積了幾寸的雪，屋頂也是白皚皚的一片。於是淑向我提議着說：「我們上北海去吧。」</p>
<p>我們踏着雪朝北海走去，金鼇玉蝀橋的白石圍欄滿積着白白的雪，南海池邊的枯柳也披上新裝。御河凍結的水面勻勻地蓋上一重潔白柔軟的白氈。北海門口的雪地上，最先吻着我倆的足印。</p>
<p>「是不是梅花開了呢！」淑指着遠處那一株株的結了霜花的樹問我。從我們站的地方望過去，那確像是一片開滿着白花的梅林。</p>
<p>「眞是南方人的口氣，現在那裏有梅花　是霜花呢！」我說。</p>
<p>我們邁着步子朝那兒走去。在這玉樹瓊枝之下緩緩踱着。脚下的雪發出了低低的脆脆的聲音，時不時有一片霜花和殘雪落在我們的衣領上面，我們像被包圍在一片白茫茫的花的霧中，又好像開到了一種淸幽的冷香。</p>
<p>淑舉起手，扳住了一枝小枝，剛想折下來，猛不防把枝枒上面的雪花　搖下來了，剩下的却是焦黃的樹枝她好容易地折下了一枝，送給我說：</p>
<p>美，明年冬天我捫不會再在這兒了　　也許這是最末的一度，也許回南方後永遠看不見白雪了，留下這結着霜花的嫩枝作紀念吧。」</p>
<p>我們默默地互相凝視着。我從她手裏接過了那支嫩枝。</p>
<p>「你曉得，霜花是容易消逝的，不一會牠就溶掉了。」</p>
<p>她沒有回答，抬起頭來望我一眼，眼裏飽噙着熱淚。</p>
<p>現在在我的行囊裏，還寳藏着她給我的那支嫩枝，但自從那一回之後，我們便一齊離開了北方，到這繁華的江南來。江南偶而也降雪的，但在十月之前，她已消然地回她南方的家去了。</p>
<p>也許她正在等着南方的梅花的開放吧，這正如我之等着大雪一般。雪先緩該會下一塲吧，但我們什麽時候才得相會呢？</p>
<p>窗外的雨在沙沙地下着，我的心便越發寂寞起來了。</p>
<h3>檢垃圾的孩子</h3>
<p>— 路直</p>
<p>早晨。拿了書走出衖子的時候，劈面走來一個小孩子。年紀很小，高不過三尺，穿着一伴女式的斜襟袷襖。我說女式，因爲襖不長也不短正蓋住他的膝頭。一條紮脚褲子，一隻灰色　另一隻是黑色的破膠鞋，戴了頂翻出裏子來的瓜皮帽，背着破麻包，拿了一具檢垃圾用的鐵鉗，這是我們常會遇到的流浪在衢頭的窮小孩子。他路走得太莊重了，這異乎平常小孩的行動留了我的步伐，仙却沒注意，走到離我不遠的一隻垃圾桶邊，站住，踮起脚，俯了半個身子爬進垃圾桶，桶口一陣陣灰塵飛起，他在裏面檢他所需要的東西。</p>
<p>掬了一刻，他掙扎地立起身，顯然很失望，將袋子扶正，拿了鐵钳要向第二個垃圾桶走去。這時候，他却用手很專誠的拂去留在他破的汚穢的袷襖上的灰塵，他一邊拂一邊又走到第二個垃圾桶照舊去檢垃圾。第二個桶掏到一些什麽，他站起，又照樣拂着衣襟轉過弄子去　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　輕輕的　自然的動作，使我很爲感動。</p>
<p>衣服本來很髒了，而且他還要繼續去爬垃圾桶，繼續將他掩　的。可是他沒有因爲這必然的理由而不去拂那染在上面的灰塵。他不因爲過去而懊喪，未來而失望，目前有灰塵，還要盡力拂去，這一種行爲，我看出人類生命力的偉大。</p>
<p>小孩子對於生活還茫然，也許他這動作很偶然，但在一般人不都是這樣麽？不因爲自己過去的不如意而懊喪，也不問未來的境遇是否可以改善而失望，還在努力他所分應做的事，努力他能力所能達到的完整，卽使已經墜在失望之中，還不斷努力着，不正和這個檢垃圾孩子拂那件骯髒衣服上的灰塵同樣麼？</p>
<p>我想到廚川白村在苦悶的象徵一書上說的：「永遠不願意凝固和停滯，避去妥恊和降伏，只尋求着自由和解放的生命的力，是無論有意識地或無意識地，總是不住地從裏面熱着的心胸，就在那深奧處，烈火似的焚燒着。」正是這焚燒着的烈火，使人們不墜於失望的深淵，使人類戰勝自然，建造社會了吧？</p>
<p>這檢垃圾孩子年歲還小，所以他的能力所能及到的改善自己，只有拂去身上的灰塵，但他能維持他這一精神，不讓他凝固和停滯在他這一生活中，則他必能超過他現在這一種生活的，這是不可置疑的事。因此我看到他背後正有一隻可怕的魔掌抓住他，將他塞進滿是骯髒的垃圾桶裏，終天討着生活，活活的害死他。這魔掌不是別的，正是他活在裏面的社會，我們這社會。</p>
<p>看着他那黑黑的，天眞的手，我暗暗祝福他，希望他以這手拂去正抓緊他的魔掌，這也正是我應做的事。</p>
<p>生命的力在人類是可貴的，可是有多少生命力被壓抑着，坑害着，消滅着</p>
<p>我咬着嘴唇走出弄子，孩子早不見了。</p>
<h3>樵歌</h3>
<p>— 劉亡</p>
<p>早晨，濃霧彌漫着起伏的山崗，猶如一條寬闊的白色紗帶，緊裏住山上的樹木。太陽已經從山背後爬起，那麽莊麗，那麼璀璨。金黃的光絲，像千萬支羽箭，射穿了霧幛，向人間發出金屬的笑聲。</p>
<p>莉伽，村莊裏那個年輕活潑的姑娘，這時掮了一支細長的扁担，跳呀奔的穿過給霧迷住的曲折小徑，向山上走去。靑白花紋的土布頭巾，在晨風中飄蕩着，勇健英俊。扁担常從她的肩胛上跳起來，她索性把它拎在手裏，像一位江湖術士般熟練地揮舞着。</p>
<p>除了下雨下雪，莉伽每天總是一早便跑到村莊前面的小山上去打柴，到太陽快移直在天空正中，村子裏，人家茅屋頂上繚繞起靑灰的炊烟的時候，她的柴也樵得堆成兩個大堆了，用繩子綑起，便挑若回家。</p>
<p>近來，她起身得更早，幹這活兒也更高興了。原來她在前個月，和東村的雲哥兒結識了，兩口子私心的愛上，借這絕早的時問，人家不大注意，作爲他們幽會的機會。</p>
<p>沿着一條黃沙的山道，莉伽輕捷地爬上山去，到山腰，她向林子裏一竄，讓翠綠的松針把她遮掩着，披開了荆　，跨到那塊　色的　　邊去。　　　的草叢中，一條泉水靜靜地流着，它射過草堆，爬過石屑，發出潺潺聲音，許多黑色的蜥蝪，在石上爬動。莉伽伸　她赤裸的脚，這些小動物全從她的足背上滑過，流向山下去。</p>
<p>莉伽在一處較深的遷子裏照下子臉，看看眼屎還糊在長睫毛上，便捧一把泉水，朝臉上抹着。她望望美麗的土布頭巾，點一點頭，笑了。她很喜愛今天紮上的這新的頭巾，她想雲哥兒見到，定會讚嘆不置的。</p>
<p>等着等着，雲哥兒還不見來。山上的濃霧，卻已變得稀薄，快要被太陽吸乾了。她覺得有一點煩躁，心裏空蕩蕩的。把扁担向泉水裏一拋，便坐下了岩石上，唱起她的情歌來。歌聲嘹喨，在山谷裏起着鏗鏘的回響。</p>
<p>「樵柴要在朦朧天，</p>
<p>戀妹要趁正少年；</p>
<p>松林底下有黑岩石，</p>
<p>恰好讓我倆交頸眠。……</p>
<p>唱得莉伽自己也有點害羞，把末句哼得又低又弱，一樓捲不住的柔情，隨着流泉遠去。她的臉孔漸漸赤紅起來，摸一下雙頰，熱得發燙。她有些憎恨雲哥兒了，怎麼到這時還不來？他應該懂得時間的珍貴的哪！</p>
<p>她想：也許他病了？可是，像一頭獅子那麽壯碩的身子會生病，這是絕對不可能的，那末是不是有別的要緊事纏住了他？想着想着，莉伽又拾起扁担，走出了松林，她站在山徑上望向山麓，沒有雲哥兒的影子。人是有一個走上來，她認得淸，那是祥生嫂，雲哥兒的鄰居。</p>
<p>待祥生嫂走近來，莉伽再也遏止不住熱情的沸勝，便急急地問着，這時，她全忘記了害羞。</p>
<p>「大嫂，你有沒有見到雲哥兒？」</p>
<p>「雲哥兒？他昨天下午去良老爺山上去樵柴，給入家看見了，去吿訴良老爺，今天一早良老爺便敎鎭上保衛團的三個團丁來把他捉去了。」祥生嫂一邊說，一邊關心地望着聽話的人。</p>
<p>莉伽沒有向祥生嫂打一下招呼，便瘋狂地奔下山去。扁担被拖得在崎嶇的山道上跳躍，靑白花的士頭巾布，像一角旗幟，在風中飄散着。</p>

<h3>敖恩洪盧氏昆仲　聯合援綏影展</h3>
<p>最近的大新公司在不斷的舉行各種展覽，不過都遍重於書畫方面，除了前次西人尼布氏的之外，攝影展覽寂寞得許久了，不想在這歲末將終的時候靑年攝影家敖恩洪和盧馥昆仲，又在大新公司四樓，（日期是本月十九至卅一日）舉行了聯合　綏攝影展覽，來結束今歲的藝壇。而他們的影展，並且是帶有救國性質的。</p>
<p>這次他們三人的作品，共有二百卅餘幀，就中以敖恩洪的最多，佔全數之半，盧毓最少。</p>
<p>敖恩洪作品中，以描寫華北方面生活建築</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>爲多，在這華北風雲緊急的時候，看了培增惆悵：敖氏的攝影，往往以極簡單的景物，抓住最緊要之點，輕描淡寫，構成優美的畫面。其中如二號「一扃風行」，　號的「烟雨圖」，古松獨立陪襯著生動的人物，畫面淸雅，更裱成立軸橫幅，古色古香，簡是一幅唐宋名畫。九十九號之「憑吊」，九十三號「飛揚」，調子强烈，別具風格，他如人像中之「白雲如駛流水年」，意味深長，靜物「枝頭小鳥伴紅妝」，生活「揚麥」，建築「白塔之夜」均爲優美之作。</p>
<p>盧馥作品多諷刺性質，題名甚切，如「懶惰者之結果」「面團團如富翁等，大有漫畫作風，一五四號「月在東窗」線條甚佳，富有詩意；他如　毓　「飮水思源」，「老樹橫秋」，均稱佳作。</p>
<p>據說他們這决援綏的辦法，是以作品售出所得之半數，捐助前方，這樣的舉動，自然是頗熱心可嘉的。</p>
<h3>「壯志凌雲」主題歌</h3>
<p>新華鉅片「壯志凌雲」是一部反映「時代的暴風雨」的作品，由吳永剛編導，金燄，王人美，陳娟娟，王决龍，韓蘭根等主演。這部片子描寫農民被掠奪的過程，完全根據血淋淋的實生活的紀錄，在吳先生的新奇活潑的手法處理之下，不啻展開了一幅觸目驚心的圖畫。劇中主題歌「拉犁歌」，由金燄王人美主唱，慷慨激昂，滿含奮鬥之精神，足以鼓動觀衆之民族意識，茲探錄其歌詞如下</p>
<p>（甲）嘿喲拉啊，（乙）嘿喲拉啊，（甲）嘿喲拉啊，（乙）嘿喲拉啊，莫回頭，莫回頭，老家自有窮和愁啊喲！水早成災三千里，縣官催租如火急喲！棄家嘿喲，離鄉嘿喲，天下走嘿喲，邊省地廣堪存留喲！</p>

The encirclement of the rebel forces remaining in Weinan has been completed. Before Zhang's rebellion, he had been in close contact with the Red bandits, deliberately ordering his subordinate cavalry unit, Bai Fengxiang's troops, to hand over weapons to the Red bandits under the guise of disarmament, providing them with 6,000 men and weapons. Recently, the Red bandits sent sixty men to serve as lower-ranking officers in Zhang's guard regiment. Sun Kexin, the battalion commander of Zhang's guard battalion, is a Red element. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhengzhou) Because Henan and Shaanxi border the rear of the Punitive Expeditionary Forces' Eastern Route Headquarters, and public security is extremely important, Henan Province has declared martial law to prevent the activities of traitors.

<h3>Yu Youren Publishes an Open Letter to the Soldiers and People of the Northwest and Northeast, Hoping Everyone Can Have a Great Awakening and Turn Danger into Safety</h3>
<p>Tongguan Yu Youren published an Open Letter to the Soldiers and People of the Northwest and Northeast. The original text is recorded below: "Since the national crisis, our Chinese nation has been under unprecedented external pressure, and national disasters and unrest have continued for years. The military and civilians across the country are in grief and composure, preparing for resistance in the face of numerous trials and tribulations in order to seek rejuvenation. Over the past few years, under the guidance of Chairman Chiang, unification has been successfully completed, and national strength has gradually increased. All spiritual and material constructions have made significant progress. The recent Battle of Suiyuan has demonstrated the great strength of the entire country in resisting foreign aggression with sincerity. International opinion has changed suddenly, and the vitality of the country and nation has also seen progress. Unexpectedly, Zhang Xueliang and others kidnapped Chairman Chiang and the central generals in Xi'an, making reckless claims and attempting to overthrow the government. As soldiers, they committed insubordination and rebellion, claiming to save the country while shaking the foundations of the nation. This will obstruct the foundation of unity, return the international status to a state of decline, and destroy all the efforts to resist aggression and survive that have been painstakingly made over the years. The Chinese people will be heartbroken, and the enemies will laugh. If Zhang Xueliang and others have any conscience, how can they bear to do this? It must be known that at this time, Chairman Chiang is using himself to ensure the safety of the entire country and nation. Harming the safety and freedom of Chairman Chiang is harming the life of the entire country and nation. Obstructing Chairman Chiang's work is destroying the vitality of the entire country and nation. Since the Xi'an Incident, both domestically and internationally, everyone has recognized this. In order to protect the country and nation, they have all resolved to protect Chairman Chiang and the central generals. The feelings of grief and urgency are all natural and cannot be suppressed. The central government's handling of this rebellion is primarily to rectify discipline, so there are orders for strict punishment and punitive expeditions. At the same time, out of concern for the innocent military and civilians, I was ordered to enter the pass to express condolences. Due to my responsibility to the country and my relationship with the Northwest, I have now been ordered to enter the pass. Traditionally, governments have always used both kindness and force when dealing with rebellions, combining punishment and persuasion. Moreover, in this Xi'an Incident, apart from the ringleaders, the generals, children, and people of the Northeast and Northwest had no prior knowledge of the incident, and were under coercion afterward. News was isolated, and their true intentions were difficult to discern. However, judging from the situation and reasoning, the central government and the entire country understand each other. Furthermore, I believe that the generals, children, and people of the Northeast, after the loss of their provinces and homes, miss their hometowns and their closest relatives, and when the compatriots across the country see the current situation of the generals, children, and people of the Northeast, they will think of their future destiny and who will not sympathize and who will not grieve. At this time, do not think that Zhang Xueliang's actions are enough to help you avenge your grievances and shame and enough to save you from returning to your hometown. How can you know that imprisoning the commander can still command troops to resist the enemy and provoke the anger of the whole country and how can there be a hometown to return to? This is truly a one-man ambition that puts you on the road to ruin. The generals, children, and people of the Northwest must know that my greatest mission here is to save Chairman Chiang and the central generals and to ensure that they regain their freedom as soon as possible, that is, to save the Northwest and the entire country and nation by saving Chairman Chiang and his comrades. We were born in the Northwest and caused such a disaster. Chairman Chiang was imprisoned in our hometown, which is tantamount to destroying the path to national and national survival. The anger of the world will turn to us, and the people of the Northwest will forever become sinners of national subjugation and genocide for thousands of generations. I am just beginning to recover from a long illness and am extremely anxious about this disaster. If the central government had not ordered me to come, I would have rushed back to the Northwest to shout loudly and call on the generals, children, and people who have long suffered with me to find a way to save the disaster. Looking back over the past ten years or so, the Northwest has suffered from war, famine, drought, and floods, and disasters have been reported every year. After the disasters, the people have been barely able to catch their breath, truly unable to save the dying and unable to seek death. At this time, what doctrines and policies can be used for empty talk, and what human and financial resources can be consumed? Those who deceive us may have other rhetoric, but those who truly care about us can only cry for us. For the sake of the present plan, if Zhang and others still do not deeply repent, turn around and redeem themselves, then the country has a code of law, and the large army has gathered from all sides. Their path to self-destruction is imminent, and the generals, children, and people of the Northeast and Northwest, who are scattered and left behind, must quickly seek self-extrication and self-rescue. This is the moment. Soldiers should clearly distinguish between what is right and wrong and should not accept illegal orders. They should always have the interests of the country and nation in mind. The people should clearly recognize what is right and wrong, and they should work hard to maintain local order. They should not be moved by heresies and conspiracies to avoid being guilty of ignorance and recklessness. Maintaining one more point of public security means avoiding one more point of destruction. It must be known that the entire country and nation is in a critical autumn of survival. No place, no organization, and no force can possibly take risks and be lucky. I only hope that everyone will be of one mind and one virtue, overcome this difficult situation, deeply understand the great righteousness, firmly uphold the great righteousness, and protect Chairman Chiang and the central generals, which is to protect themselves, which is to protect the Northwest, and to protect the second hometown of the generals, children, and people of the Northeast, and which is to protect the bright future of the Republic of China and the Chinese nation. When I was about to enter Shaanxi, they telegraphed to stop me, but I believed that the Northwest was the fourth pole of the Republic of China and also my hometown. Although they stopped me from coming, I had to come, because although I did not come specifically for them, if it could be redeemed and taken care of, then my coming would not necessarily be a blessing for them. Therefore, at this time, I still hope that everyone will have a great awakening and work together to create a situation of turning danger into safety, so that discord can be transformed into peace and harmony. The generals, children, and people of the Northwest and Northeast, at this moment of safety and danger, are still making extremely important contributions to the country and nation. Sincere words, I hope you will listen and observe. Yu Youren." (23rd) Sent from Tongguan. (24th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Zhu Jiahua Publishes a Talk on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhu Jiahua, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, arrived in Nanjing on the 23rd to attend the Central Political Council meeting. In the afternoon, reporters visited him. According to him, public security in Zhejiang Province is not a cause for concern, and there are existing military and police forces that can be used to deal with it. However, there are financial difficulties, but there are also ways to deal with them, and everything can be handled according to appropriate steps, and construction work can still be carried out fully. He also published a talk on the current situation as follows: "What the people, officials, soldiers, and police of Zhejiang Province are most concerned about now is the safety of Chairman Chiang and the handling of the Xi'an Rebellion. When the news of the rebellion first reached Hangzhou, the people could not avoid being surprised and suspicious. When the government adopted extremely strict policies, people's hearts were settled. Everyone believed that the only way to sanction Zhang the thief was to use rapid military force to suppress him. Zhang the thief never expected that the central government would still be so stable during the period when the Chairman was in trouble, so his plan to disturb the central region failed. When the central government immediately dismissed him from his post and handed him over to the Military Council for disposal, coupled with condemnations from all sides, followed by the issuance of a punitive expeditionary order, and the start of bombing by aircraft, Zhang the thief immediately revealed various states of panic. For example, his release of Mr. Chiang Ming-san to fly to Nanjing was an expression of panic. At this time, strictly abiding by the central government's decision to continue to apply great pressure, especially using aircraft to bomb his forward positions and the troops he is concentrating on a large scale, is the most effective method of suppressing the rebellion. This will definitely be able to shake his military morale, so that those under his command who understand the great righteousness will have the opportunity to defect. If there is any slight deviation, it will give Zhang the thief the convenience of opening up the Communist Party's front, then there will be more branches and the overall situation will be even more unthinkable. Therefore, the entire people of Zhejiang Province support the central government's great decision by twelve points, and at the same time, they are very eager to hear the good news of the great military pressure. I saw in the newspaper the Chairman's handwritten note to Minister He on the 16th, and I admire it immeasurably. In such an environment, he still maintains his usual upright attitude. While understanding the suffering of the people, he still gives Zhang the thief an opportunity to reform, and he is not perfunctory at all. He is truly a rare hero in Chinese history. Looking closely at the tone of the letter, it clearly shows that the responsible persons here sympathize with the central government's rapid use of troops and advocate a rapid solution. The handwritten note says that no bombing will be done before Saturday, which is tantamount to saying that bombing must be done after this. The 'Rong She' [military society] is also this meaning. The whole country should understand the Chairman's intentions, seek their realization, and actively carry out a military encirclement, so as not to fail the Chairman's upright attitude of 'never evading' and 'unyielding.' At the same time, if Zhang the thief has any conscience and knows the critical moment of life and death, under the reflection of this upright leader, he should also reflect, measure the strength and weakness of his own troops, and surrender to avoid futile sacrifice. Some misunderstandings believe that handling things too hastily is not without danger. However, the fact is that only by this resolute and rapid method of punishing crimes and rebelling can the Chairman be safe from danger, and all of these are proper measures. Let us try to analyze Zhang the thief's psychology. At first, he wanted to 'hold the emperor to command the princes,' but later he realized that it was useless and was only scolded by all sides. In addition, the national army gathered from all sides, and his life was not guaranteed. In the end, he wanted to rely on the Chairman as a life-saving talisman. He would never dare to harm the Chairman. As for Zhang the thief's collusion with the Communist Party, it is clearly to cause trouble. In fact, the playboy sons of rich families, who usually live a life of prostitution and gambling, are fundamentally incompatible with the wandering life of the flowery Communist Party. When it comes to consolidating the central government and stabilizing the locality, it also depends on the speed of the central government's use of troops. In Hangzhou, I heard the news of the rapid central military actions every day. After arriving in Nanjing, I also learned about the speed and decisiveness of the central government's policies and their implementation, so I am very relieved. I firmly believe that Zhang the thief will be polite in sending the Chairman back to Nanjing after being attacked and bombed again." (23rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Dai Chuanxian Vigorously Advocates Rectifying Discipline</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Dai Chuanxian, President of the Examination Yuan, has vigorously advocated rectifying discipline and suppressing rebels since the Xi'an Rebellion occurred. He has made impassioned statements at various meetings, saying that the country's righteousness cannot be suppressed in the slightest. Zhang's rebellion in kidnapping the leader is an act of insubordination and rebellion that affects the foundation of the party and the country and is not comparable to ordinary rebellions. He has also personally drafted a eulogy for the deceased in Shaanxi, which is righteous and solemn. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Shaanxi Party Committee Talks About the Situation in Xi'an</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Qingyuan and Guo Zijun of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, who escaped from danger in disguise, said: "On the 12th, during Zhang's rebellion, the people inside and outside Xi'an city still did not know the truth on the 13th and 14th. It was not until the central government's aircraft went to Xi'an to distribute newspapers from Nanjing and Shanghai that they learned the details of Zhang's rebellion. People from all walks of life were extremely indignant. After Zhang's rebellion, reactionary slogans were found on the streets of Xi'an, but they were quickly torn down, which shows a glimpse of the internal chaos. Now the people of Shaanxi Province are eager for the central army to drive straight in as soon as possible to relieve their distress, and the Northeast Army is also disintegrating due to Zhang's perverse actions. The punitive expeditionary military affairs will surely be successful in the short term." (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Public Telegrams</h3>
<p>Telegram from London: To the Central Party Committee and the National Government, Zhang Xueliang's betrayal of the Party and the country, kidnapping President Chiang, and shaking the Suiyuan anti-Japanese front have aroused the indignation of overseas students. It has been resolved that the Central Government be requested to issue a clear order for suppression to uphold national discipline, and to order the soldiers in the front to take advantage of the victorious momentum to recover the lost territory. Furthermore, the Chinese Communist Party is harming the people and the country, and disrupting the rear. They should be thoroughly wiped out to avoid future troubles. All members of the Chinese Students' Association in London.</p>
<p>Telegram from Tunxi: To all compatriots at home and abroad, Our school recently sent a telegram to Zhang Nilang Xueliang in Xi'an, which reads, "Mr. Zhang Hanqing of Xi'an, One person in trouble can make the whole country sad and shocked the world. This one person is one who has never been seen in Chinese and foreign history. You have actually violated him. From the perspective of public morality, no matter what your claims or excuses are, may I ask what path you can take? Moreover, this one person is the one who bears the death penalty for losing territory for you, and the one who has painstakingly considered and ordered you to travel to Europe, so that you, as a stubborn young master, can be reborn and become a promising and outstanding military leader who has the hope of avenging his father and wiping out national humiliation. You have actually violated him. From the perspective of private morality, no matter what your claims or excuses are, may I ask what path you can take? Fortunately, think a thousand times, think ten thousand times. The only path you can take now is to respectfully send Chairman Chiang Gong, who has the destruction of the nation on his shoulders, back to Nanjing to preside over the great plan of saving the nation. If you still have some conscience left, if you want to calm the grief and anger of the whole country and the shock of the world, only Chairman Chiang Gong has this power. Fortunately, think a thousand times, think ten thousand times, and we also hope that all your subordinates and compatriots will think a thousand times and think ten thousand times, etc." Zhang Nilang Xueliang committed treason and rebellion, destroying national discipline and destroying the foundation of the country. He is worse than a beast. The whole world is indignant. We humbly think that our compatriots should unanimously advocate and request the government to quickly stir up national sentiment and intensify the suppression, so that when the rebel is in the midst of the artillery fire of the national army, like an ant on a hot pot, looking for a way to survive, perhaps he can stimulate one ten-thousandth of his conscience that has not been completely lost. The teachers, students, and workers of the Middle and Primary Schools of the Anhui Provincial Huizhou Middle School, 721 people in total, respectfully.</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Question of Solidarity in the World of Opinion</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>Organized public opinion is the driving force of democratic politics and the main condition for victory in diplomacy and military affairs. For public opinion to be organized and powerful, the world of opinion, which bears the responsibility of leading and expressing it, must first have a sound organization, strong unity, and close cooperation. China is currently in a time that most requires sound public opinion, yet it has not demonstrated the necessary strength. The biggest difficulty is the inability of the world of opinion to unite. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Journalists Association held a general meeting, and some advocated inviting all registered newspaper reporters to join the association as members in order to improve the organization of the journalists' association. This suggestion is worthy of consideration by the world of opinion.</p>
<p>News reporters, whose profession it is to lead society and represent the people, should at least have the professional status of lawyers, doctors, and teachers in order to ensure the sanctity and honor of their profession. We cannot deny that the procedures for entering the profession of journalism are sometimes too lax. After becoming a reporter, the degree of supervision by colleagues is also insufficient. In European and American countries, there are few that do not have sound journalists' organizations. The task of these organizations is to raise professional standards, improve the lives of reporters, jointly study the knowledge and skills that reporters should possess, and represent the entire world of opinion in contact with all sectors. Of course, European and American journalists' organizations include British and American press organizations that are purely journalist-centric, as well as German and Italian journalists' organizations that take national interests as their highest principle. Although both types of organizations have their critics, from the perspective of the press and the entire society and country, having these organizations is an improvement over the era of laissez-faire.</p>
<p>Even in Germany, where freedom of speech is most restricted, the German Journalists' Association, according to the 1933 German Journalists' Law, has the responsibility to monitor all members' fulfillment of their obligations and to protect their rights. Anyone who is not a member of the German Journalists' Association cannot practice journalism in Germany. The Central Journalists' Association seeks to cultivate journalistic talent and promote the common welfare of the press. All disputes in the press are handled by the professional court attached to the association. We cannot arbitrarily assume that this organization is a tool for Hitler to suppress freedom of speech, because Germany already had this professional organization before Hitler came to power. The high achievements of the German press in terms of quality are mostly due to the sound journalists' organization. In the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries, journalists' national bodies not only seek to improve their lives and raise their status, but also study the improvement of the newspaper industry and seek common propositions and views on certain issues.</p>
<p>In extraordinary times, the preparation for the mobilization of opinion is even more important than military and economic mobilization. Because without public opinion and morale, nothing can be pushed forward. The press bears the greatest responsibility to the country. However, the press today has not yet achieved the same strict organization as the military, or the same level of cooperation and unity as the transportation industry. Therefore, a sound organization is an urgent requirement for actively improving the newspaper industry, promoting public spirit, and passively coping with the extraordinary situation and clarifying the press. This is what the press needs, and it is also what the 400 million people of China, whom they represent, need most.</p>
<h3>Closing Day of the Pan-American Conference: U.S. Secretary of State Announces New Monroe Doctrine: The Americas Unite to Defend Against External Aggression, Setting a Peaceful Example for the World</h3>
<p>"Either Eliminate War, or Be Eliminated by War"</p>
<p>(Buenos Aires) At the closing of the Pan-American Peace Conference in the capital of Argentina today, U.S. Secretary of State Hull delivered an inspiring speech, stating, in brief, that we must eliminate war, or war will eliminate us. Now that a list has been made for each country to examine its own goals and government, each country should, like an individual, forgive and forget the damages inflicted by other countries. He must solemnly declare that the American countries are not moving towards an isolationist policy. The American countries will never harbor the illusion of egoism, knowing the harm of this doctrine. In this closely organized and interdependent world, we deeply feel the folly of building a Great Wall of China around the New Hemisphere. Our purpose is not to isolate the American continent, but to delineate the path by which we can achieve peace, thereby setting an effective example for other parts of the world. Free people of the world do not believe that war is inevitable. They are no longer intimidated by the spears of warmongers. They will loudly stop those who seek to destroy peace for the sake of power. They believe that the future peace can be guaranteed by the development of public opinion everywhere, because that public opinion will completely condemn the actions of politicians who promote militarism, etc. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull recently delivered a closing address to the Inter-American Conference, praising the conference's ability to unite the American nations to resist external aggression. Responsible parties here believe that this is the New Monroe Doctrine announced by the United States. Informed observers stated that such an interpretation will implicitly transform the Monroe Doctrine from a policy of the United States alone into a common policy of all American countries. Therefore, the American nations will henceforth jointly bear the responsibility of maintaining peace in the Americas and resisting external aggression. If the nations of Europe and Asia dare to attack the Americas, the combined forces of the navies and armies of all American nations will respond, not just the military strength of the United States alone. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>Chairman's Address</p>
<p>The Pan-American Peace Conference in the capital of Argentina, which began on the first of this month, has lasted more than twenty days. The closing ceremony was held today, with the chairman, Argentine Foreign Minister Lamas, delivering an address, stating that this conference has benefited both the Americas and world peace, and is worthy of attention. The results are numerous, and the most important are (1) the method of consultation, that is, the American countries should consult each other to prevent or stop wars through joint and concerted action; (2) the principle of non-intervention, that is, other countries should not interfere in the internal affairs and foreign affairs of each country that do not involve other countries. "According to the Geneva Protocol of 1924, all countries should enjoy equal sovereignty and have the right to pursue a policy of neutrality. We now reiterate this and seek new ways to achieve neutrality in order to avoid the scourge of war. The 'Declaration of Cooperation among American Countries' is sufficient to prove the existence of democratic rule and joint responsibility, and reiterates that all wars of aggression and violent intervention are illegal... In short, if disputes occur between the American countries in the future, they must be resolved by peaceful means. Even when wars occur outside the Americas, we should cooperate with other countries to stop the conflict, because although we pursue a policy of neutrality, we cannot ignore the scourge of war," etc. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Philippine Islands Issue: Consultation Principle Applies</h3>
<p>(Washington) At the closing of the Pan-American Peace Conference today, representatives from 21 countries placed great emphasis on the principle of mutual consultation. This has raised speculation among U.S. authorities as to whether this principle can also be implemented in the Pacific in the future. It is said that the conversation between U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Murphy and President Roosevelt next Monday, and Philippine President Quezon's planned trip to the United States in February or March of next year, may indicate that the government is trying to implement the neutrality of the Philippines. Therefore, the government may consult with countries related to the Pacific. (Note: Article 11 of the Philippine Independence Act stipulates that the President should negotiate with other countries as soon as possible to recognize the permanent neutrality of the Philippines after its independence.) Observers believe that no matter how the Philippine issue is resolved, this consultation plan can enhance the U.S. position, that is, the Pacific issue should be resolved through mutual consultation among all interested countries, rather than through any bilateral agreement. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Suggest to the U.S. Negotiations on Pacific Issues</h3>
<p>(Washington) It is reported that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita plans to propose to the United States to conduct negotiations on the issue of Japanese-American relations in the Pacific. Semi-official circles here have expressed considerable goodwill towards this news, believing that according to the Philippine Independence Act, the island will separate from the United States and become independent in 1946. The United States should try to guarantee the neutral status of the Philippines before that date. If Japan is willing to start negotiations with the United States now, it will be easier for the United States to guarantee the neutral status of the Philippines. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>18th Session of the League of Nations Assembly to Be Convened at the End of January Next Year, Abyssinia to Lose Right to Attend</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The 18th session of the League of Nations Assembly will be convened between January 25th and February 5th of next year to vote on Egypt's admission as a member state. League of Nations officials recently announced that notices of the assembly meeting will be sent to all member states at the end of this month. The Administrative Council originally planned to meet on January 18th of next year, but it may have to be postponed by several days due to the simultaneous holding of the assembly. In addition, the United Kingdom and France will submit a proposal to all member states of the League of Nations, asking them not to allow the Abyssinian delegation to attend the League of Nations again, so that the factual status of the country can be determined, and Italy can cooperate with the League of Nations again. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Drafts of Two International Conventions: China's Reply Sent to the League of Nations, Expressing Acceptance of the Establishment of an International Criminal Court, Two Suggestions Made for Punishing Terrorism</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Regarding the issue of punishing international terrorism, the League of Nations Administrative Council's Committee of Legal Experts previously drafted two types of conventions, one being the Convention for the Suppression and Prevention of Terrorism, and the other being the Convention for the Establishment of an International Criminal Court. The Administrative Council sent them to the governments of all member states for review. The Chinese government recently sent a reply to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, accepting in principle the proposal to establish an International Criminal Court. Regarding the issue of suppressing and preventing terrorism, it stated that it was regrettable that the Committee of Legal Experts had failed to consider the proposal submitted by the Chinese government. The Chinese government felt that it was difficult to punish terrorism due to the existence of concessions, public concessions, and leased territories in China, and requested that the Committee of Legal Experts study it again. According to the Chinese government's proposal, there were two items: (1) Any country that enjoys extraterritoriality in another country should have consular courts to manage cases involving its nationals. If such nationals commit crimes of political terrorism, they should be transferred to the jurisdiction of the judicial authorities of the host country. (2) Any country that administers part of the administrative affairs in another country due to the existence of concessions, public concessions, and leased territories within the territory of another country should provide all kinds of conveniences to the judicial authorities of the host country when punishing political terrorism.

<h3>Japanese Parliament Convenes and Establishes, Opening Ceremony to Be Held Tomorrow</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The 70th Ordinary Session of the Japanese Parliament convened at 9:00 AM on the 24th in the newly completed Parliament Building. All members of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives attended. After determining the seats of each member, each department elected its ministers, directors, etc. Thereupon, the parliament was established. (Domei, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The opening ceremony of the Japanese Parliament is scheduled to be held at 11:00 AM on the 26th in the House of Peers. The Emperor is scheduled to personally attend the venue that morning, bestow a rescript, and then return to the palace. (Domei, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In view of the fact that diplomatic issues are valued by all factions, at the factional negotiation meeting on the 24th, some people advocated that Daikichi Tagawa from the Second Lounge should raise an urgent question on diplomatic issues on the 27th. The negotiation meeting did not approve, and it was shelved. Although both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties are concerned about diplomatic issues to a considerable extent, they do not have the enthusiasm to raise them as a formal agenda item and decide on the party's attitude. Even if the government's beliefs are questioned by other means, diplomatic issues will not be questioned in the form of urgent questions before the parliamentary recess. (Domei, 24th)</p>
<h3>Japan-Soviet Fisheries Agreement Extended for One Year, Both Parties Sign Provisional Agreement</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Recently, Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Shigemitsu Kui has repeatedly visited Litvinov and Deputy Commissar Stomonyakov to discuss the fisheries agreement. Shigemitsu suggested signing a provisional agreement to extend the validity period of the old agreement to December 31, 1937, since the old agreement has expired and the Soviet government has stated that it cannot conclude a new agreement at this time. That is, the current fishing regulations will remain in effect until the end of next year. Both parties have agreed to this suggestion in principle, and the text of the provisional agreement is currently being drafted. (TASS, 20th)</p>
<h3>Tokyo Jiji Shinpo, Which Has a History of More Than Fifty Years, to Cease Publication Today</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Tokyo Jiji Shinpo Co., Ltd. decided to dissolve at its 33rd shareholders' meeting on the 24th. The newspaper was one of the two major businesses of the late Yukichi Fukuzawa and has a history of 55 years. It is truly regrettable that the newspaper will have to cease publication on the 25th.

<h3>Cuban President Recently Removed from Office, Issues Address to the Nation, Worrying About the Future of the Political Situation</h3>
<p>Havana: The special court formed by the Senate tonight tried the President's impeachment, and with a vote of 22 to 12, ruled that President Gómez should be removed from office immediately and replaced by Vice President Laredo Brú in accordance with the constitution (scheduled to be sworn in at noon tomorrow). As for most of the cabinet members, they have now resigned en masse. Earlier, Senator Portela had presented and read the defense statement personally drafted by the President, stating in brief: "This impeachment case is a violation of the constitution. Its motive is not to uphold justice and fairness, but to force me to resign. I am willing to abide by all rulings of the special court, but I must appeal to public opinion to clarify right and wrong. After I leave office, an era of infighting for power and profit will begin in the country. The freedom and rights of the Cuban people will also disappear completely. Democratic politics will come to an end from then on, and a dictatorship will rise up." (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Havana: President Gómez recently issued an address to the nation from his private residence, attacking Colonel Batista, the Chief of Staff of the Army, with all his might, stating in brief: "Does Colonel Batista dare to openly establish a dictatorship? All he has done is reactionary. I am a Cuban revolutionary and should criticize him. We have suffered greatly from tyranny and have risen up to resist since former President Machado fled." Finally, the President wished the people of the country a safe Christmas. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Havana: The President's dispute with the Parliament and Army leader Colonel Batista this time was over the sugar tax of nine cents, which was used to establish rural schools for the army. It has been passed by both houses, but the President believes that such schools will turn Cuban youth into warlords, which led to Batista's attack on the President, saying that if the people want a dictatorship, he can be a dictator. Now that the President has resigned, a military coup is unlikely to occur. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) The sudden surge in Cuban national politics, with President Gómez having been removed from office by a special court, has all been noted by the U.S. State Department. Some even asked whether the new government to be established in Cuba is in accordance with the law. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Switzerland Recognizes Italy's Sovereignty in Abyssinia, Embassy in Addis Ababa Converted into Consulate</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Swiss government has legally recognized Italy's sovereignty over Abyssinia. In addition, the Belgian government has decided to withdraw its embassy in Addis Ababa and convert it into a consulate general. Foreign Minister Ciano expressed satisfaction to the governments of both countries on behalf of the Italian government. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Professor of Peking Medical University Discovers Ancient Human Bones, Dating Back 500,000 Years</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) "Sinanthropus pekinensis" is the oldest Neanderthal bone in Europe, discovered near Beijing in 1929. It is considered to be the oldest human bone in the world, along with the so-called Java Man, which was discovered in Java 40 years ago. However, in the middle of last month, Professor Hua Ding of Peking Medical University also discovered similar human bones in Yanjiaodian, east of Beijing, which has attracted attention from the archaeological community. The new discoveries include four skull bones, twelve skull fragments and lower jaw bones, and hundreds of teeth, belonging to two adult corpses. The human bones are almost in the same location as those discovered in 1929, buried only ten feet deep in the soil. These human bones are believed to be 500,000 years old. It is said that cannibals at the time hid in caves to avoid diseases. Peking Medical University was greatly stimulated by this discovery and will continue to excavate after receiving support from the American oil tycoon. (Domei, 24th)</p>

<h3>Pope Reads Encyclical, Calls for World Peace, Criticizes Red Propaganda Movement, and Attacks German Heresy</h3>
<p>Vatican City: At 11:30 this morning (7:30 PM Shanghai time), the Pope delivered a speech from his sickbed using a specially made silver-plated microphone, appealing for peace to the world. After the Pope finished his speech, it was immediately translated into English. The entire speech was probably quite lengthy. Because the Pope had just recovered from a long illness, his doctor, Dr. Milani, would be at his side to administer medicine at any time. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Vatican City: Pope Pius XI recently used a radio broadcast to read the Christmas encyclical. He began by saying that the current crisis was urgent and that the whole world and the Catholic Church were under threat. He specifically mentioned the Spanish Civil War at length, saying that "the civil war is intensifying, with mutual killings and destruction reaching extreme cruelty." He then denounced the communist propaganda movement and attacked German heresy. Finally, he prayed for peace, saying that while appealing to the whole world, we should still sincerely pray to God to obtain peace and tranquility, and that justice should be realized between individuals and groups, because only by achieving peace can we enjoy peace, and without justice, order cannot be maintained. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Goes to Villa to Spend Christmas, Discusses Current Situation with Aides Before Leaving Capital</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German leader Hitler left for the Berghof villa in Berchtesgaden last night, planning to stay there until January 11th of next year, so all official duties were suspended, and preparations were made for the holiday. After Hitler left Berlin, the worries about imminent conflicts in Europe were relieved. It was originally scheduled for Hitler to go to the villa on Tuesday, but he did not leave that day. Instead, he spent the whole day meeting with Aviation Minister General Göring, Defense Minister General von Blomberg, and other important officials. For a time, rumors spread, and people generally believed that the meeting was about the overall situation in Spain, the implementation of the non-intervention agreement, and economic issues. It is said that Hitler instructed his subordinates not to give him Christmas gifts, but Hitler himself sent several of his adjutants to buy suitable Christmas gifts several weeks ago so that they could be distributed to his friends and colleagues under the Christmas tree in Hitler's villa tonight amidst songs. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Celebrates Christmas, Full of Prosperity, Post Offices Are Extremely Busy, Stores Triple Their Profits</h3>
<p>(New York) The prosperity of this year's Christmas in the United States is unprecedented in many years. The number of letters at the national postal offices is truly rare. The offices originally had 20,000 employees, but because the workload was too busy, 5,000 temporary office workers were hired. Several overdue European mail ships will arrive in New York tonight or tomorrow, carrying a total of 27,000 mailbags. The postal office will try its best to deliver them before the 25th. Transportation by national aviation, railways, and highways is also extremely congested. Many New York residents braved the cold and flocked to major stores to buy goods, so each store more than tripled its profits. Social events are gradually returning to the state before the recession.

<h3>Intervention in the Spanish Civil War Intensifies in Germany, Number of Volunteers Entering Western Territory Increases, Several Foreign Warships Participate in Blockade of Ports</h3>
<p>(London) According to informed sources, Italians have been gradually withdrawing from the territory controlled by the Spanish rebels, while Germans are continuously entering the country, and their numbers are increasing. For example, 9,000 Germans arrived in Cadiz, a port controlled by the Nationalists, on November 21st, another 600 arrived on November 26th, and on December 6th, six Junkers aircraft made in Germany were transported to the port, all equipped with 42-millimeter cannons. It is also said that several foreign warships have changed to the flags of the Spanish Nationalists and participated in the blockade of the port of Barcelona. For example, the Nationalist army has a cruiser, the "Admiral Cervera," participating in the blockade, but some people have glimpsed the ship at three different places at the same time, indicating that at least two ships are disguised as foreign warships and using the name of the ship. In addition, according to reports from informed sources, Barcelona, Valencia, and Madrid are all controlled by anarchists. The Soviet authorities only cooperate with the anarchists and have no contact with the Spanish Communist Party, because the Communist Party in Spain is small in number and its influence is not great. In the territory controlled by the Republican government, there are occasional cases of people going out at night to kill anti-government elements, but these are all irresponsible individual actions. As for the Republican government authorities, they have done their utmost to prohibit terrorist actions. According to general observers, the people of Spain are deeply tired of foreign intervention in the civil war, so mediation of the civil war may be possible in the near future. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Adjustment Committee Passes Detailed Monitoring Plan, Awaiting Agreement from Relevant Governments, Then Submitted to Warring Parties with Deadline for Reply</h3>
<p>(London) The Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War Adjustment Committee met at the Foreign Office here today for two hours and unanimously passed a detailed plan to monitor the shipment of arms to Spain by sea, land, and air. Relevant governments are required to reply by January 1st of next year. If all countries agree, the plan will be submitted to the warring parties in Spain with a deadline of ten days to endorse it. Today's meeting also resolved to ask relevant countries to submit documents to the committee by January 4th of next year, stating whether they are prepared to allocate funds to implement the aforementioned plan, and the percentage of their contribution has been explained to them by the committee. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) The government has recently decided to instruct the ambassadors stationed in Germany, Italy, and Russia, and the minister stationed in Portugal, to explain repeatedly to the governments of their respective host countries that the non-intervention measures in the Spanish Civil War must be monitored, and it is also necessary to prohibit foreign volunteers from going to Spain to participate in the civil war. Responsible parties believe that the influx of volunteers from certain countries to Spain will inevitably cause serious repercussions and will greatly hinder the prospects for peace in Europe. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>France Expresses Strict Neutrality; Will Change Current Policy if Other Countries Don't Cease Interference</h3>
<p>(London) The Times recently published a dispatch from its Paris correspondent stating that the French government has issued a public announcement. It states that if the involved countries do not adopt the proposals of the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish conflict to ensure that the non-intervention agreement can be effectively implemented, the French government will change its current policy. This action is due to the increasing interference of Germany in the Spanish Civil War and not due to the communist propaganda movement in that country. (24th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Lord Plymouth, Chairman of the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Conflict and Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, recently inquired of the governments of the involved countries about their opinions on prohibiting indirect intervention in the Spanish Civil War. (Note: "Indirect intervention" refers to the dispatch of volunteers from various countries to serve in Spain and the provision of financial assistance to both sides of the civil war.) Regarding this issue, the French government sent a reply to Plymouth today. According to responsible sources, the French government, in its reply, listed the various measures it is currently taking and expressed its willingness to adopt legislative procedures to prohibit indirect intervention in the Spanish conflict. However, France will only do so after other countries have also adopted similar legislative decisions. It is also said that the French government intends to crack down on both French and foreign nationals traveling to Spain, and all those wishing to travel to Spain must be investigated to ensure that they have legitimate reasons before passports are issued. In addition, the French government also intends to take other measures to prohibit the provision of financial assistance to both sides of the Spanish Civil War. (23rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Britain Feels Uneasy About Germany's Actions in Spain; Hopes Germany Will Change its Attitude and Ease Tensions</h3>
<p>(London) Germany's economic situation is extremely dire, especially the food supply. It is rumored that the authorities are now planning to ration food. Upon hearing this news, political and economic figures here are extremely uneasy, fearing that if this situation worsens, Germany's interference in the Spanish Civil War may intensify in order to find a way out. The London stock market has already been affected by this. Although responsible figures in London still hope that the work currently being carried out by the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Conflict will reduce German interference and thereby avoid a major disaster. In addition, regarding Germany's proposal to restore colonies, responsible figures in the UK believe that some of these colonies are administered by the UK under the mandate of the League of Nations, and their transfer of jurisdiction is not something that the British government can decide. Regarding the issue of raw material redistribution, its solution is actually part of the overall solution to various European problems, and only then can the UK consider it. (23rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) German Ambassador Ribbentrop returned to his country some days ago to spend Christmas. Political figures here very much hope that when the ambassador returns to his post, he will bring new instructions from his government on the issues of prohibiting volunteers from joining the Spanish Civil War and the future Locarno Treaty, so that the international situation can be eased. Responsible figures say that the British government is currently conducting negotiations with various governments, especially the German government, through diplomatic channels, requesting the prohibition of volunteers from joining the Spanish Civil War, and declaring that this move is necessary to maintain peace in Europe. Regarding this, Ambassador Ribbentrop had discussed it with Foreign Secretary Eden before returning to his country. Foreign Secretary Eden said at the time that Britain is eager to resolve general European problems, but as far as is generally known, the biggest obstacles to Germany reaching an understanding with other countries are the definition of an aggressor nation and how to designate an aggressor nation, which Germany opposes being decided by the League of Nations. In addition, political figures have also expressed the opinion that if Ambassador Ribbentrop can bring back a proposal from his government regarding the definition of an aggressor nation that is acceptable to all parties concerned when he returns to his post, then his country's opposition to the new Locarno Treaty and the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pacts will also be eased accordingly. However, this approach is only a hope and should not be overly optimistic. (24th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>France's Attitude Towards Germany's Colonial Demands: A Genuine Solution to General European Problems as the Price of Exchanging Colonies</h3>
<p>(London) The Times published a dispatch from its Paris correspondent today discussing France's attitude towards Germany's demands for colonies and non-intervention in the Spanish conflict. It briefly stated that if Germany is prepared to solve general European problems in a practical way as the price of exchanging colonies, then France should naturally agree to give colonies to Germany. Conversely, if Germany's demand for colonies is only to flaunt the power of the Nazi Party, then France has decided not to make any sacrifices. In short, although France is prepared to hold negotiations at any time to resolve Western European problems, it is not willing to use the colonial issue as a stepping stone for negotiations and thereby trigger discussions on other agreements. In France's view, Germany should first change its policies, abandon its threats and intimidation, and replace them with security guarantees. It should abandon its plans for large-scale rearmament and replace them with disarmament and arms control. Only then can France make some concessions to Germany on the colonial issue. However, such concessions by France must also be accompanied by sacrifices from other countries, because France is not the country that has benefited the most since the war. Even if Germany no longer has any demands on the countries of the world, its current interference in the Spanish conflict is more than enough to promote war. The nature of this matter is important and surpasses other events. German leader Hitler has repeatedly declared his aim is peace, so he should make every effort to avoid this interference. Therefore, French Foreign Minister Delbos is said to have informed the German government that if Germany intensifies its aid to the Spanish rebels and provides it with substantive assistance, then France will not be able to consistently adopt a non-intervention policy. In addition, The Times' Paris correspondent has also obtained reliable information to believe that French Foreign Minister Delbos has instructed the French Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Corbin, to suggest to the British government that the UK and France should jointly declare to Germany that the UK cannot tolerate Germany's actual invasion of Spain. The UK and France believe that this move by Germany is the beginning of disaster, and its intention is clearly to change the military strategic situation in the European Mediterranean, so that Germany can gain the upper hand in future wars. It is very clear that this kind of action will not prompt the UK and France to give some land to Germany, so that the country can use it as an outpost for engaging in war. (22nd Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Negotiations for Exchange of Hostages Break Down</h3>
<p>Saint-Jean-de-Luz: The hope of exchanging 4,000 detainees held as hostages by the warring parties in Spain before Christmas has been dashed due to the breakdown of negotiations. After many discussions, the representatives of the two sides have reached a complete stalemate. The main difficulty in the discussion is the age of military service. This afternoon, a British warship arrived here from Bilbao, carrying only a small number of refugees and no released hostages, which caused considerable disappointment to the welcomers on the dock.

<h3>He Jingwu Arrives in Jinan; Will Meet with Song After Visiting Han, Then Head to Ping</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Mr. He Jingwu left Beijing on the 21st and took the Pingpu train north, arriving in Jinan at 10:00 a.m. on the 22nd. Chairman Han sent Zhang Cheng from the Provincial Committee to welcome him at the station. After Mr. He got off the train, he stayed at the Jinpu Railway Hotel to rest. Then, accompanied by Zhang Cheng, he toured Jinan's market streets and the road on the city wall. At 11:30 a.m., he went to the Provincial Government to meet with Chairman Han and attended a banquet hosted by Han. He had a lengthy conversation with Han in the office. Chairman Han expressed great concern for Chairman Chiang and said that he would support any good proposals and would do his best if needed. He would follow the Central Government in everything. Mr. He left the Provincial Government at 1:30 p.m. and took the Jinpu train 202 to Ping at 8:18 p.m. to meet with Chairman Song. He plans to stay in Ping for three or two days before returning to Beijing to report. Before Mr. He left Jinan, the reporter visited him and asked about the purpose of his visit and the results of his meeting with Chairman Han. I was granted an audience and recorded the following conversation:</p>
<h3>He Jingwu's Talk</h3>
<p>"The Xi'an Incident was completely unexpected. The entire country is extremely anxious and hopes for a swift resolution and the early rescue of Chairman Chiang. I have been traveling back and forth between Beiping, Luoyang, and Nanjing these past six or seven days, without any free time, which has made me feel unwell. I have not yet recovered. This trip north is to visit friends in a private capacity and to meet with Chairman Han of Shandong and Chairman Song of Beiping. I have known both Chairman Han and Chairman Song for a long time. Chairman Han has met me in Ping several times and invited me to visit Shandong, but I have been unable to accept due to work. Later, Shi Tang passed through Jinan, but he was also unable to get off the train due to being busy. I am very happy to have this opportunity to visit Chairman Han and reminisce about the old days. During the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army in 1928, I served as the Transportation Commander, leading the armored car team to Jinan. I only stayed for one day, and then the May 3rd Incident occurred and I was forced to leave Jinan. I lived on the train for six days and left with great pain. It has been ten years since I came to Jinan again. In recent years, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the country's political construction has been thriving, and the country's future is very promising. Unexpectedly, Zhang Xueliang suddenly launched a coup in Xi'an, kidnapping Chairman Chiang, which aroused unanimous opposition from the entire country. When I left Beijing, I had not heard the news of Chairman Song (Ziwen) returning to Beijing. I have read in the newspapers that Chairman Song has returned to Beijing. Madame Chiang Song Meiling is naturally even more worried about Chairman Chiang's safety. Even if someone tries to stop her, I am afraid she must go to Xi'an. When Jiang Dingwen left Xi'an and passed through Luoyang, I met with him and talked for a long time. Jiang did not know Zhang's true intentions. Zhang also knew that Chiang was in danger and that he himself would hardly escape. He told Chiang Dingwen to tell everyone to absolutely ensure Chairman Chiang's safety and believed that Chairman Chiang was in no danger. Zhang's actions against the will of the people will ultimately fail. The fact that the country has remained exceptionally stable in the midst of this crisis shows the progress of the nation and the people, which is truly gratifying. After arriving in Jinan this morning, I was greeted at the station by Chairman Han's representative, Chairman Zhang Bingqian. After getting off the train, I toured the streets of Jinan and felt that Shandong, under the leadership of Chairman Han, has made great progress in construction and the local area is extremely peaceful, which I deeply admire. At noon, I went to the Provincial Government to visit Chairman Han. After talking with the Chairman for a long time, we both felt that there were no specific measures to rescue Chairman Chiang. Chairman Han said that he would support any opinions and do his best wherever he was needed, and that he would follow the Central Government's policies in everything. I also felt that the news media in various places should contact the local newspapers to print additional copies and send them to Luoyang to be delivered by air to Xi'an by the Commander of the Air Force, Mao Bangchu, to let Zhang Hanqing understand public opinion and realize his mistake as soon as possible. I think this move will definitely be effective."</p>
<h3>Yu Hanmou Sends Li Xuhuan to Beijing by Air to Request Instructions; Zou Lu Forcibly Travels to Beijing to Discuss National Affairs; Zhang Renmin Accompanies Deng Shizeng to Guilin</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the Shaanxi Incident, the authorities in Guangdong and Guangxi made efforts to maintain local security. In addition to issuing a telegram to express his attitude, Yu Hanmou, the Pacification Commissioner of Guangdong Province, also reported on the Shaanxi Incident at the joint military and political memorial week on the 21st. He solemnly declared that unified resistance to aggression is the unanimous demand of the whole country, and that those who violate the above requirements and obstruct the safety of the leader will be abandoned by the people of the whole country. Yu originally planned to go to Beijing to request instructions from the Central Government on the major plan for maintaining security, but because it was the winter defense period and defense was important, he could not spare the time. Therefore, he sent Li Xuhuan, Director of the Political Training Department of the Fourth Route Army, by air on the 20th, via Jiangxi Province, to Beijing, to represent him in reporting on the recent military and political situation in Guangdong Province and to request instructions on future policies.</p>
<p>Zou Lu, the President of Zhongshan University, had been living in seclusion to recuperate after returning from Europe following the renewal of the situation in Guangdong. He had not been involved in the affairs of Zhongshan University for a long time. His place of recuperation was first at Nengren Temple on Baiyun Mountain in the suburbs of Xi Zhou, then he moved to the Hot Springs area of Conghua County, and recently he has been hiding in an ancient temple on Mount Luofu. He has changed his place of recuperation three times and seemed to have not heard about the current situation for a long time. However, after the occurrence of the Shaanxi Incident, Zou's long-term illness had improved slightly. On the 21st, he attended the Zhongshan University Memorial Week, convened all the faculty and students to give instructions, and told them that the current situation was serious, and the students should implement their past proposals and jointly bear the responsibility of resisting aggression and saving the country. Zou also told reporters that after the Shaanxi Incident, the Central Government immediately telegraphed him to go to Beijing to discuss national affairs. Zhang Xueliang's rash action was extremely regrettable. He had to travel to Beijing with all his might to discuss effective methods with his comrades in the Central Government to assist Sui and rescue Chairman Chiang. On the 22nd, Zou, along with six or seven attendants, took the early morning ferry from Guangdong and Hong Kong to Hong Kong to wait for a boat to Shanghai and then to Beijing.</p>
<p>Regarding the attitude of Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi in Guangxi towards the Shaanxi Incident, two telegrams have already been sent. It is said that Li Pinxian was also planning to fly to Guangdong to exchange opinions some days ago, but it has not been possible due to weather conditions. It is said that Li will be able to fly to Guangzhou on the 22nd. Zhang Renmin, the staff officer of the Guangxi Army who led the Guangxi military and political inspection delegation some days ago, hurriedly passed through Guangdong the other day and went to Hong Kong, intending to lead the inspection delegation north. However, due to the situation, it was terminated. The Guangxi inspection delegation is now temporarily staying in Hong Kong awaiting orders. Zhang returned to Guangdong from Hong Kong again on the 20th, stayed in Guangdong for one day and night, and accompanied Deng Shizeng, the chief adviser of the Fourth Route Army, to Guilin by plane on the 21st to report to Li and Bai and to coordinate everything.

<h3>The Pseudo Southeast Special Committee on the Border of Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi has Disintegrated; More Than Eighty Pseudo County, District and Township-Level Organs Have Been Uncovered One After Another</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The counties of Wanzai, Yifeng, Pingjiang, Liuyang, Yangxin, Tonggu, Wuning, and Pingxiang in the combined area of Jiangxi, Hubei and Hunan provinces are surrounded by mountains and have complicated terrain. The remnant bandits under Xu Yigang, Fang Buzhou, and Yan Tuguo, based in places such as Huangjin Cave, constantly roamed the borders of northwestern Jiangxi, eastern Hunan, and southern Hubei. Under the command of Xiong Bin, the Commander of the Jiangxi Northwestern Anti-Banditry Campaign, the First and Second Security Regiments and the 708th Regiment of the 36th Brigade were divided into two columns to advance. They advanced from Yifeng towards the Hunan-Hubei border and recovered Huangjin Cave. In order to completely eliminate the remnant bandits, the department established political training sub-groups in the border areas of the bandit-suppression counties, and established model guerrilla groups under the sub-groups. These groups absorbed repentant elements to infiltrate the bandit forces for reconnaissance in order to uncover various secret organs of the bandits, which has been effective. Xiong Bin has reported to the Anti-Banditry Command of the Pingxiang Jiangxi-Hunan Border Region on the progress of bandit suppression. The progress is recorded as follows: "It has been found that three parts military and seven parts political is the only strategy for bandit suppression. Since its establishment in August this year, in addition to strictly supervising the troops to actively suppress the bandits, in terms of party and government, we have assisted the county magistrates of various counties to work hard. In order to increase efficiency, this headquarters has established political training groups in Wanzai, Pingxiang, Xiushui, Tonggu, Yifeng, Gaoan, Fengxin, Jingan, Wuning and other counties. Political training sub-groups were established in the border areas, all of which were directly under the command of the political training group of this headquarters. The main task is to eliminate remnant bandits, eliminate internal spies, improve mass organizations, awaken the anesthetized masses, convert to the Three People's Principles, thoroughly expose the bandit party's means of deceiving the masses, and crush the bandit party's internal and external organizations at all levels. Each sub-group is attached to a model guerrilla group (i.e. armed plainclothes team) for suppressing reactionaries, searching for scattered bandits, and covering the work of the sub-group. This system is actually the first of its kind since the launch of the suppression in this province, and it is also the most effective strategy for suppressing scattered bandits. Although the establishment of the sub-groups in the counties has been gradual, the statistics show that more than 80 pseudo county, district and township-level organs in various places have been uncovered, with 600 to 700 members of pseudo organizations, more than 100 captured, recruited, and killed red bandit cadres, and a large number of guns and various reactionary documents have been seized. The pseudo Southeast Special Committee, which occupied the border between Wanyi, Pingliu, and has been completely disintegrated."</p>
<h3>Fujian Province: This Year's Budget Established, In Reality Still Deficit Spending</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The budget proposal for the 25th year of the Republic of China in Fujian Province has now been compiled by the Provincial Government and submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and approval. Although the figures on paper show balanced income and expenditure, the reality is still deficit spending. This is because the income figures are based on the highest possible projections, which will certainly not be reached in the final accounting. The expenditure figures are based on the lowest possible projections, which will certainly be exceeded in the final accounting. Therefore, the provincial authorities are still making great efforts to rectify various taxes, such as conducting special investigations to clarify the reasons for the revenue shortfall. Starting from the 26th year, the system of contracted tax collection will be abolished to prevent tax collectors from enriching themselves. At the same time, all government agencies will be encouraged to economize on expenditures to reduce waste, only allowing for surpluses within the budgeted amount and not exceeding the original budget proposal. The main points of the local budget for the 25th year of this province are outlined below:</p>
<p>(A) Income Section</p>
<p>(1) Regular Revenue: Land tax 1,426,034 yuan, deed tax 600,000 yuan, business tax 2,815,993 yuan, house and shop tax 479,968 yuan, boat tax 207,712 yuan, local administrative revenue 503,197 yuan, local property income 112,000 yuan, subsidy income 2,156,556 yuan, other income 220,000 yuan, totaling 9,827,838 yuan. (2) Temporary Revenue: Collection fee 182,252 yuan, stamp tax 595 yuan, construction surtax 416,050 yuan, education surtax 411,354 yuan, security surtax 8,990.42 yuan, special business tax 2,237,386 yuan, central subsidy income 932,000 yuan, construction funds allocated by the National Economic Council (00,000 yuan, road construction subsidy income 180,000 yuan, other income 749,800 yuan, debt income 3,800,000 yuan, totaling 9,596,479 yuan.</p>
<p>(B) Expenditure Section</p>
<p>(1) Regular Expenditure: Party affairs expenses 151,490 yuan, administrative expenses 2,280,135 yuan, judicial expenses 800,160 yuan, public security expenses 4,163,000 yuan, financial expenses 1,017,084 yuan, education and cultural expenses 2,006,208 yuan, construction expenses 903,982 yuan, health expenses 261,920 yuan, assistance expenses 789,374 yuan, totaling 12,854,590 yuan. (2) Temporary Expenditure: Administrative expenses 129,360 yuan, construction expenses 986,930 yuan, assistance expenses 153,029 yuan, miscellaneous expenses 252,000 yuan, totaling 6,569,727 yuan.</p>
<p>As for the local income and expenditure of various counties and cities in the province, no budget proposals have been prepared in the past. In order to thoroughly reform the financial and administrative system of the province, the provincial government started the compilation and review of the local budgets of the counties and cities for the 15th year of the Republic of China in May and June of this year. The method was for each county and city government to compile a preliminary budget proposal based on the amount of local income and expenditure for this year and submit it to the province. The provincial government then handed it over to the Department of Finance to review it together with the relevant departments, bureaus, and offices. By September, all reviews were completed. However, at the beginning of this year, the financial and administrative systems and various taxes of the counties had undergone unprecedented changes. In order to accurately determine income and expenditure, the provincial government reissued the reviewed preliminary budget proposals to each county, ordering them to be provisionally implemented on a trial basis. If there were any comments, they were to be reported back within a limited time. Subsequently, the counties and cities successively reported back, and after the Department of Finance re-examined them, they were submitted to the provincial government committee for discussion in batches. Now, all have been approved. According to statistics, the total income and expenditure of 62 counties and one city is more than 8 million yuan. More than 120 kinds of miscellaneous taxes have been abolished, resulting in a reduction of more than 300,000 yuan. It can be said that the counties and cities of this province have only produced legally binding budget proposals this year. (23rd)</p>
<h3>Baoding Fourth Prison: Political Prisoners Plot Escape, Guards Bribed to Allow Thugs to Enter Prison, Escapees Surrounded and Captured by Military and Police</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Political prisoners in Baoding Fourth Prison have been actively plotting since the Shaanxi Incident, intending to take advantage of the opportunity to incite ordinary prisoners to jointly storm the prison. A guard named Wang Keren, having been bribed by people outside the prison, allowed four thugs to enter before the lockdown on the 22nd, mixing them in with the political prisoners. Each thug carried a firearm. At around 3:00 a.m. on the 23rd, they started an incident inside the prison, with all the prisoners rushing out. The guards' firearms were completely seized, and the office of the Second Section of the prison was surrounded. The on-duty chief guard, Zhao Xingwu, and the staff were driven into a corner of the room, and Zhao was forced to hand over the keys to each prison. Zhao refused and was severely injured. At that time, most of the prison gates were broken open by the prisoners, who rushed out and plundered more than 30 large rifles stored in the warehouse, carrying them out the gate, shouting slogans, and distributing leaflets. At this time, some staff of the prison and the chief of the Second Section, Zhou Kuiyuan, etc., escaped over the wall because the telephone lines were cut, and reported to the Hebei Provincial Security Office, Public Security Bureau, etc. Gao Shuxun, the deputy director of the Security Office, immediately dispatched a team to be on guard in the area of the east gate of the prison. At the same time, he quickly notified the 53rd Army to send two companies of soldiers and the Guards Battalion to send one company of soldiers to surround the prison. At around 4:00 a.m., the military, police, and constabulary had all arrived at the scene and made proper arrangements. When the thugs came out of the gate, they were intercepted by layers of military and police, and a fierce conflict immediately broke out. The thugs tried to rush out three times, but were all driven back. For a time, in order to prevent further incidents, the authorities ordered the traffic to be cut off, and the city gates were all tightly closed. The two sides confronted each other until around 6:00 a.m., when the authorities increased the number of reinforcements by dispatching two battalions of infantry from the 109th Brigade of the 37th Division and ordered them to climb the houses around the prison and press inward. At this point, the thugs began to surrender their weapons, and the escapees were captured one by one. By 7:30 a.m., the entire incident was resolved. By 9:00 a.m., the entire city had returned to normal.</p>
<p>After receiving the news of the prison storming in Baoding, Deng Zhexi, the president of the Hebei Provincial High Court, immediately went to Song's residence in Wuyi Ku Hutong to meet with Song and report the incident. Mr. Song was extremely furious and ordered that the lawless elements be dealt with by military law. At the same time, the prison warden, Ma Shixiong, and the security personnel were also severely punished for dereliction of duty. After Deng resigned, he convened a meeting at the High Court with Wu Shiyuan, warden of the First Prison, Tian Wenlie, warden of the Second Prison, and Wu Bingcheng, director of the Beiping Detention Center, to discuss the prevention measures for the prisons in Beiping. A decision was made after much discussion. After the meeting, Tianjin Third Prison and other prisons were also ordered to pay attention to prevention to avoid similar incidents from happening. In order to investigate the truth of the Baoding incident, Deng sent a Mr. Zhou to Baoding on the 23rd. Deng himself is also planning to go there in the next few days. (23rd)</p>
<h3>Kunshan: Tea Shop Tragically Robbed by Bandits</h3>
<p>Recently, robbery cases in various villages have been reported frequently. The Fuxin Tea and Food Shop in Binxi Township, Second District, was suddenly attacked by more than ten bandits at around 1:00 a.m. on the 22nd. The shop owner, Chen Baisheng, the maid, Yang, and the apprentices were tied up and beaten severely. The bandits then wantonly searched and looted the shop, resulting in a loss of more than 200 yuan in cash and other items. The case was reported to the county for investigation and pursuit, but the bandits had already fled far away.</p>
<h3>Refugees Disturbing Villages and Towns</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 23rd, more than 200 refugees arrived in the Huangjing area, which is the border area of Kunshan, Changshu, and Wujiang counties, disturbing the villages and towns in the area and occupying the local temple. The Fourth Branch Bureau of Bacheng in this county immediately reported the incident and, together with the County Bureau, the water patrol team, and the security team, rushed to the area to intercept and drive them out of the area.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Xijing Traitor Captured in Zhitang</h3>
<p>After the garrison stationed here arrested two traitors the other day and executed them, yesterday (the 23rd), the Zhitang Public Security Bureau arrested four more traitors at the train station. The traitors were disguised as chicken vendors and carried more than 20 chickens, male and female. They boarded a car at the Zhitang Bus Station. Because their actions were suspicious, they were identified by the police at the station. After questioning, they did not understand any of the jargon used by chicken vendors. They were immediately taken to the local Second Branch Bureau for detailed interrogation. They confessed their names as Gu Yulong (from Rugao), Li Xiuzhen, Liu Guangfa, and Wang Qiyou (all from Anhui). They directly admitted that they were being used by a certain party to come to Changshu to carry out reconnaissance work and investigate troop movements. Each person could get 1.4 yuan per day. This time, they came to Changshu for the second time, etc. After obtaining the confession, the branch bureau immediately sent them to the Public Security Bureau. The Supervisory Office, considering that the case was a serious crime involving traitors, secretly interrogated them again that night. It is reported that, except for Gu Yulong's cunning confession, the other three criminals have confessed without reservation. They will now be transferred to military law for trial.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Summoning Tu Zheng for Instruction</h3>
<p>Because the major households in this county owed more than one million yuan in land tax, Su Caiying sent Dong Qicheng, a tax collection commissioner, to Wuxi to urge payment. After Dong arrived in Wuxi, he consulted with the Long County Chief several times on how to recover the arrears. The matter was completed yesterday and he returned to the province. Currently, the county government has decided to summon all the Tu Zheng and tax collectors of the county on the 29th of this month to the county for instruction, instructing them to make efforts to collect taxes and ensure that 600,000 yuan must be collected in the shortest possible time. If there is any delay, they will be dealt with according to law. As for the years for which arrears are being collected, the focus is on the taxes owed from the 20th to the 24th years of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Hunger Strike by Prisoners</h3>
<p>The prisoners in the county prison and detention center are protesting over the issue of food rations. According to regulations, each prisoner is supposed to receive one jiao of silver per day, with a meal weighing 24 taels. Recently, the amount of food has been reduced. Yesterday (the 23rd) at 3:00 p.m., the prisoners rioted and refused to eat, causing great chaos. The warden, Tang Qimu, went to stop them, but they refused to listen to his advice. Tang A'bao, a prisoner awaiting trial for opium offenses, and Zhang Jinbao, an administrative detainee, were the most激烈。 They were taken out separately. At the same time, the county government was telephoned, and Tang Jien, the leader of the Second Platoon of the Security Team, led the team to suppress the riot and persuade them to eat as usual. The situation did not calm down until around 5:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Building a Ring Road</h3>
<p>Hou Houzong, the county chief of Wujin County, said that the ring road in the county, except for the section near Qingliang Temple, which was built by public labor service in the 24th year of the Republic of China, the section from De'an Bridge eastward to Wuqing Road, and the section where the existing roadbed extends and connects to Wuyi Road, have not yet been completed. Yesterday, he specially ordered Zhao Changfeng, the district chief of the First District, to list this as a labor service project for the 25th year of the Republic of China in the district, and issued blueprints, etc., ordering him to immediately instruct the relevant township chiefs to supervise the strong men to start work on schedule and report the tools so that personnel can be dispatched at any time to guide the project.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Brothel Bathhouse Cracked Down</h3>
<p>Li Yurong, the Baozhang of Menghu Township, No. 10 Xinximen Riverside in this port, runs a paper mill as his business. Recently, due to the arrival of the severe winter, business has been slow. Suddenly, he had a whim to build a small room in the store and secretly set up a women's bathhouse, enticing ignorant women to go to bathe. Each bath only cost five jiao of silver. The average woman was greedy for its cheap price, so they introduced each other and flocked to it. Little did they know that the bathhouse was not only poorly equipped and unsanitary, but also mixed men and women, which was a matter of morality. The incident was discovered by the Public Security Third Branch Bureau. Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 p.m., the Branch Bureau Chief Ji Zonghan led Patrol Officer Weng Zuyi and more than ten policemen to arrest them. At that time, the Kunqu opera actors Zuo Yunxia and Zuo Cai were bathing in the room, and a woman named Zhang was undressing outside the room, waiting to bathe. Seeing a large number of men in black entering, they were shocked and discolored. The Branch Bureau Chief Ji ordered those who had entered the bath to quickly put on their clothes and took them to the branch bureau for interrogation. It is heard that they will be transferred to the General Bureau for punishment.</p>
<h3>Wanfu Bridge Completed</h3>
<p>Wanfu Bridge in Jiangdu County, this province, has been destroyed by military service for a long time. The Jiangsu Construction Department believes that the bridge is a necessary thoroughfare for the Yangqing, Yangjing, and Yangpu roads. In August of this year, the Construction Department allocated funds and specially dispatched engineers to supervise the construction. Now, it has been fully completed. The road surface paving on the roads connected to the bridge has been completed one after another, and all can be opened to traffic.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Woman Heartbroken and Dying</h3>
<p>Guan Xueren, a tea servant at the Zhongnan Bank in Shanghai, from No. 7, Jia 6, Bao 10, Maqiao Township, Fourth District, Jiangdu, only has his wife Jiang, age 24. On the night of the 22nd, Li Yuanhai, a resident of the same village, suddenly broke open the gate and entered, hacking at Jiang's head and arms with a sharp axe and cutting off her right ear. At that time, the sound of screams spread to the neighbors, who rushed to check and rescue her. Jiang was already lying in a pool of blood, and Li was still holding the axe beside her. Jiang's father, Songlin, was notified and reported to the Winter Defense Office. The patrol team leader, Zhan Shucun, led the team to rush to the scene and arrested the murderer and the carpenter Chen Xiaoqi, who lent Li the axe, and sent them to Xianzhen. Currently, Jiang is dying after being injured. It is said that Li and Jiang had previously been in love, but Jiang followed her husband to Shanghai. Li once followed her, and Jiang told him to return to his hometown and talk about it again. This summer, Jiang returned, and always gave Li the cold shoulder. The seeds of disaster may have been planted here.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Murderer Arrested in Tong</h3>
<p>Zhang Wenwei, from Yuyao, was doing business in Shanghai. His son was defrauded of a huge sum of money by Shen Lishun and killed.

On the 23rd, the Nantong District Court concluded the trial of Shen Lishun and sentenced him to life imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Schools Stop Giving Winter Vacation</h3>
<p>The county government stated that this year's winter vacation, according to the primary school layer regulations, will be given from January 18th to January 31st. However, during this year's winter vacation, it is appropriate for the second phase of mass training. Teachers and staff of primary schools at all levels mostly serve as political training instructors, bearing heavy responsibilities and unable to ask for leave. On the 24th, all primary schools in the county were ordered to stop giving winter vacation. All teachers and staff should stay in school and not listen to their own wishes. In addition to undertaking mass training political program, they must also conduct a thorough investigation of school-age children in the education area, so that the enrollment system can be promoted in the next semester.</p>
<h3>Handling Rent Collection According to Previous Cases</h3>
<p>In order to ensure the main source of land tax revenue for the first period of this year, the county government is using the Baojia system to strictly urge households to pay, in order to achieve results. It is also said that grain comes from rent, and the poor harvest of rent rice will damage the income from grain tax. Now, in order to take into account the collection of rent rice by industry households, it has been decided to follow previous cases and establish a rent collection office in the county from the winter solstice, where industry households can apply for the recovery of unpaid rent rice from tenants in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Strict Handling of County Chief in Lost City Case</h3>
<p>The county town of Changhua was recently captured by bandits, and the county government, the Party headquarters, and many houses were burned down, resulting in huge local losses. The provincial government, considering that the county chief, Yu Mingchang, had left his post without permission and stayed in the provincial capital, detained him and transferred him to the Zhejiang High Court for trial in accordance with the law. The criminal division of the court once held a trial. Yu's testimony was evasive, and he was sent to the detention center and prosecuted by the court for dereliction of duty and strictly handled.</p>
<h3>Conscripting Strong Men to Fill the Seawall</h3>

<h3>Representatives from All Circles Held a Grand Meeting Yesterday to Support the Central Government in Punishing the Rebels; Over Two Thousand Five Hundred Representatives from Various Groups Attended; All Vowed Allegiance to the Party and the Nation and Supported Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, in order to uphold the central government in punishing the rebels Zhang Xueliang, who betrayed the Party and the nation, hijacked the supreme commander, detained generals who were suppressing the Communists and resisting the enemy, and obstructed the defense against humiliation and national salvation, specially convened a grand meeting of representatives from all circles at the City Chamber of Commerce Auditorium at 2:00 PM yesterday to support the central government in punishing the rebels. Important proposals were also passed. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Representatives Present</p>
<p>Including Wu Xianxian, Tao Baichuan, and Pan Gongzhan from the Municipal Party Headquarters; Wu Tiecheng from the Municipal Government (represented by Zhou Yongneng); Yang Hu from the Garrison Headquarters; Zhou Xuexiang and Zhu Xuefan from the Lu Jingshi General Labor Union; Tong Xingbai from the Boy Scouts Council; Huang Zaoxiong from the Education Association; Zhang Shouyong from the New Life Movement Promotion Association; Du Yuesheng and Wang Kui Sheng from the Local Association; Wang Xiaolai and Jin Runyang from the City Chamber of Commerce; Yu Zhenhui from the City Morning Association; Cai Jinjun and Liang Fuchu from the Public Security Bureau; as well as representatives from various agencies, groups, schools, and Party departments at all levels, including Liu Heqin, Huang Xianggu, Zhang Yunzeng, and Yu Yaoqiu, totaling more than two thousand five hundred people, with Wu Tiecheng (represented by Zhou Yongneng), Pan Gongzhan, Cai Jinjun, Tong Xingbai, Lu Jingshi, Zhang Shouyong, Du Yuesheng (represented by Wang Kui Sheng), Zhu Xuefan, Huang Zaoxiong, Yu Zhenhui, and Pan Gongbi as the twelve members of the presidium.</p>
<p>Meeting Order</p>
<p>(1) Opening of the meeting; (2) Playing of the national anthem; (3) Paying respects to the Party, the nation, and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen; (4) Reading the Last Will and Testament of Sun Yat-sen; (5) Observing three minutes of silence for the martyrs who died in the Xi'an Incident; (6) Chairman's report; (7) Speeches; (8) Discussion of proposals; (9) Shouting slogans; (10) Playing music; (11) Adjournment of the meeting.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the rituals were completed, Chairman Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech, stating that the representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai are holding this meeting to support the central government in punishing the rebels. All representatives have come to participate, and they must have two kinds of feelings: (1) Infinite pain and indignation at Zhang Xueliang's rebellion in Xi'an. At a time when peace and unification have been achieved internally and the war of resistance against the enemy is beginning externally, Zhang Xueliang, driven by madness, hijacked our national leader, causing great damage to all the great undertakings of national construction and rejuvenation, both internally and externally. This is truly the public enemy of our entire nation and a matter of great pain and indignation. (2) Showing great strength. Zhang Xueliang's unrighteous, disloyal, and unfilial actions will surely be punished by justice. When Zhang Xueliang's rebellion occurred, the central government initially showed magnanimity, so on the 12th, it still considered giving him a chance to reform himself, only giving him the punishment of dismissal and investigation. However, Zhang was completely unrepentant. People across the country, regardless of their position, expressed great indignation and unanimously applied to the central government to punish him. Therefore, on the 16th, the central government issued a decree to punish him. The whole country is united. Under the leadership of the central government, all people are of one mind, rising up to condemn him, supporting the central government, punishing the rebels, and rescuing Chairman Chiang. After this incident, we can fully demonstrate the organized and united spirit of our country. The government still maintains a consistent spirit of implementing national policies in the event of unexpected incidents. This is a manifestation in the political aspect. Furthermore, in terms of the economic situation, the stability of international exchange rates and the market transactions are also not chaotic, which shows that our business and financial circles have a deep understanding of the country and a sound organization of themselves. Other examples include young students, workers, etc., who sincerely support the leader, support the central government, and work harder at their own duties. At this time, the only thing to do is to stabilize local order and calm the people of the whole country. Shanghai is an important town in the country and an international metropolis. The gentlemen participating today represent 3.6 million citizens of the city. Everyone should wholeheartedly support the central government, implement national policies, support the hardworking and meritorious Chairman Chiang, punish the rebel Zhang Xueliang, and strive for the revolution. We will surely achieve the final victory, and the great cause of saving the country and rejuvenation will surely be completed.</p>
<p>Speeches from All Circles</p>
<p>Subsequently, Zhou Yongneng, the representative of Mayor Wu, gave a speech, stating that our nation's highest leader, Chairman Chiang, has been engaged in revolution for many years. After the death of Sun Yat-sen, he laid the revolutionary base in the southwest and consolidated the revolutionary foundation. Afterwards, he led the national army to eliminate the warlords, suppress the communist bandits, and unify China. He also created all spiritual and material constructions. The nation's rejuvenation is just around the corner. However, Zhang Xueliang disregarded the will of the people and hijacked the supreme commander, causing great damage to this nascent revival movement. His crime is extremely heinous. In addition to supporting the government, thoroughly discussing the rebels, and rescuing Chairman Chiang to get out of danger as soon as possible, we must continue to lead the great cause of national revival. Then Zhang Shouyong gave a speech, stating that I will talk about the past, the present, and the future. Chairman Chiang painstakingly built the revolutionary foundation in the past and is now working hard to revive the great cause. Zhang Xueliang is an unrighteous, disloyal, and unfilial person. In comparison, everyone knows who has the support of the whole country. Now, the general youth have a real understanding. From a justice perspective, Zhang will surely be destroyed, and Chairman Chiang will be able to get out of danger as soon as possible. Then the future of the country will definitely have unlimited hope. When Zhang was giving his speech, he spoke with tears in his voice, moving the audience. Then Cai Jinjun and Liu Hequn gave speeches. The length of the words is omitted.</p>
<p>Declaration of the Congress</p>
<p>The declaration of the Shanghai All-Circles Representative Congress to support the Central Government in suppressing the rebellion: Since the September 18th Incident, our country has suffered from the invasion of strong neighbors and the harassment of communist bandits. The national crisis is serious, like eggs piled up. Fortunately, our Chairman Chiang has been able to withstand the current and prop up the precarious situation, upholding the intention of perseverance and determination, and setting the policy of internal pacification and external resistance. He has worked diligently day and night, bearing hardships and enduring grievances, and has been able to sweep away the communist bandits that spread like wildfire, lay the foundation for a unified political situation, and then develop the spirit of national self-defense, stepping up the work of resisting the enemy and saving the country. When the pseudo-bandits attacked our Suiyuan border, our loyal and brave soldiers on the front line, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, fought and conquered Bailingmiao in the icy and snowy weather, and then recovered Damiao. This is indeed the starting point for our people to recover and revive, a fact that people all over the world do not deny. Unexpectedly, at this time of defending against humiliation in Suiyuan, when good news was frequently reported, and the recovery of lost land had just begun, Zhang Xueliang, a wolf with wild ambitions, actually colluded with communist bandits and hijacked the leader. This kind of rebellious behavior directly wants to rekindle the ashes of the communist bandits, destroy national unity, undermine national discipline, and deter the morale of resisting the enemy. This can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? The Shanghai All-Circles Congress to Support the Central Government in Suppressing the Rebellion, representing the entire Shanghai. After all three speeches were given,</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals</p>
<p>After the speeches were completed, Chairman Tong Xingbai presented the proposals to the conference for discussion. (1) Issuing a declaration, resolved, amended and passed. (2) Telegram to the Central Government to support the Central Government in suppressing the rebellion, resolved, passed. (3) Telegram to Minister He of the Ministry of Military Affairs, requesting that troops be dispatched quickly to suppress the rebellion and rescue Chairman Chiang, resolved, passed. (4) Circulating a telegram to compatriots across the country to unanimously condemn the rebellion, resolved, passed. (5) Loyally advising the Northeast soldiers to defect to justice as soon as possible and rescue Chairman Chiang to return to the capital, resolved, and a letter to the Northeast soldiers was drafted, and then distributed to the Northwest by plane. (6) Telegram to Yang Hucheng to escort Chairman Chiang back to the capital, resolved, passed. (7) Telegram to the Suiyuan bandits suppression soldiers, continue to work hard to suppress bandits, resolved, passed. (8) Organizing a delegation to welcome Chairman Chiang, resolved, and fifty people including Yu Qiaqing were nominated (details of the list will be given separately). The 3.6 million citizens dare to tell our countrymen with a few meanings. The fall of the four northeastern provinces, Zhang Xueliang, is the culprit and should be placed under the law to show warning. Our central government and Chairman Chiang take the enemy in front of them, and do not pursue the past, hoping that the rebel will move to good and correct his mistakes, work hard to govern the army, and store it for national use. He did not make this rebel hide evil intentions and repay kindness with resentment when he waited for a long time for obvious crimes, and exhausted the ability to turn clouds and rain, old crimes of rebellion and chaos, taking advantage of Chairman Chiang and the generals to discuss major plans, suddenly carrying out the hijacking of the leader, claiming soldiers to coerce, acting like bandits, and the crime cannot be forgiven. All of our countrymen should abandon him. This is one of them. Chairman Chiang endures humiliation and bears burdens, and has experienced hardships. His daily and monthly operations are the foundation of revival and self-improvement. Recently, the completion of China's unification, the gradual consolidation of national defense, the rapid advancement of domestic politics and economy, and the increasing international status and reputation are all the harvest of Chairman Chiang's perseverance and hard work. Now Chairman Chiang is continuing to deploy national defense against the enemy and seeking to wash away the strange shame of the lost land, but Zhang Xueliang is scattered and hijacked the commander of the whole country, so that he cannot carry out his wishes. Its influence on resisting the enemy and defending against humiliation must not be small. Judging from his crimes, he is deeper than the traitor who acts as a tiger's paw. If the traitor is not eliminated, the national crisis will not end. All of our countrymen who are determined to eliminate traitors and defend against humiliation should rise up to punish him. Zhuang, this is the second. Discipline is the foundation of the country, and without discipline, how can there be a country? Today, Zhang Xueliang, as a soldier, hijacked the commander and acted arbitrarily, undermining discipline. Nothing is more serious than this. Gu still wants to steal the name of saving the country to cover up his mistakes. People are not cattle or pigs, and they are cursed to be deceived. Moreover, the fallacies of saving the country listed by him are all mistakes and disasters for the country. Saying "accommodate the communists" is not tolerated by the national conditions, and it is no different from colluding with communist bandits. Saying "ally with Russia" is like an idiot's dream, and he vainly hopes for the pity of different species. If we stop suppressing bandits, how can we stabilize people's livelihood? If we reorganize the government, we will directly subvert the foundation of the country. All our countrymen who support the central government's policies and do not want to sit idly by and watch the decline of discipline should rise up and kill this man to maintain discipline. This is the third. At this time when the leader is in distress, the foundation of the country is shaken, the enemy's atmosphere has not subsided, and the rebellion has recurred, those traitors who are willing to be tigers, and the politicians who have lost their conscience, cannot avoid being tempted to act at the right time and take advantage of the opportunity to incite them. From the perspective of the nation, they are all enemies of the people. All sectors of our country should be loyal to the country and rescue our leader at this difficult time. On the one hand, we should support the central government in suppressing the rebellion, and on the other hand, we should gather forces to maintain law and order, so that our country, even if it suffers an unprecedented incident, and the leader, even if he is temporarily hijacked, the national policy will always be implemented, and the people's hearts will be as stable as ever. It is almost as if Chairman Chiang has given persevering teachings. This is the point. In short, Zhang Xueliang, with his mind lost and sick, raised troops to cause chaos, colluding with communist bandits internally, obstructing combat opportunities externally, betraying the country as disloyalty, not avenging his father as unfilial piety, poisoning living beings as unkindness, and hijacking the leader as injustice. Filling this disloyalty, unfilial piety, unkindness, and injustice, is truly what the gods and people are angry about, and what heaven and earth cannot tolerate. Suppressing rebellion and eliminating traitors, suppressing bandits and defending against humiliation are the national duties of the people, and we must not refuse. I hereby declare that we will jointly eliminate the great rebels.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Central Government</p>
<p>Nanjing Central Party Headquarters and the National Government, with respect: Since the Xi'an rebellion, the whole country has been shocked, and all those who have blood and breath are angry. In the past ten days, all parties, from the court to the public, have expressed their views, severely sanctioning the country to the full extent of the state's organizational discipline. However, Zhang has no remorse and sincerity. At first, he requested the central government to postpone the suppression in order to delay the war, and then he deployed troops and generals, attempting to complete his conspiracy to betray the Party and the country. When the bandits in the border areas were in urgent need, it was the time when the whole country was united to resist humiliation. Zhang Xueliang, who was responsible for suppressing bandits, should be loyal and repay the country so as not to fail the country's trust. However, he colluded with bandits because of suppressing bandits, and funded the enemy because of colluding with bandits. Moreover, he hijacked the commander and detained the generals, committing crimes and doing everything. The people of the whole country felt the pain of the rebel's death and the destruction of the country, and they still had the heart of being afraid of killing the rat. It was unexpected that the rebel was rebellious by nature and refused to repent. If such a big crime is not eliminated, the national disaster will have no bottom. If you raise it, it will cause trouble. If you tolerate it, it will be good. It should be requested that the central government immediately order the front line to add punishment, destroy this man, so as to maintain discipline, and Zhang Zheng Yi. This association is willing to lead 3.5 million citizens and vow to be a reserve force. The electric shock cannot overcome the indignation and wait for orders.</p>
<p>Communicate to the whole country</p>
<p>(Title omitted) Zhang rebel Xueliang was a death row prisoner who lost his division and lost land, and he was responsible for suppressing bandits in the border area of Chongqing. How should he be loyal to the Party and the country, and work hard to make contributions? However, he colluded with bandits because of suppressing bandits, and funded the enemy because of colluding with bandits. He hijacked the commander and detained the generals. His mind was lost and sick, and nothing was more serious than this. Moreover, according to reports in recent days, the rebel has not regretted his mistakes since the incident, and he has requested the central government to postpone the suppression in order to delay the war, and on the other hand, he has mobilized troops and actively prepared for military action. His conspiracy to betray the Party and the country has been clearly revealed. If we do not immediately add punishment, it will raise the symptoms and cause trouble, and the national disaster will become more and more serious. As the saying goes, "If a poisonous snake bites your hand, a strong man will break his wrist." In addition to requesting the central government to immediately add punishment to destroy this man and rescue Chairman Chiang, we should ask the whole country to unanimously advocate for justice. The telegraph is urgent, and we await your Mingjiao.</p>

<h3>More Than Two Thousand Young Men in Shanghai County Vow to Rescue the Leader from Danger; Held at the County Government on the Morning of the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after the Shaanxi Incident occurred, Chiang Kai-shek was in distress. People from all walks of life in Shanghai County were extremely angry. For the past ten days, Zhang Xueliang has not had any sincere repentance, and the leader has not been out of danger. More than 2,500 young men who were trained in the second phase of the county were willing to dedicate their blood and sweat to the central government, rescue the leader, and suppress the rebels. Therefore, at 9:00 AM on the day before yesterday (23rd), all the trained young men in the county, except for the four, five, and three districts that were far away from the county government, gathered at the same time. All the districts should take an oath. In addition, more than 200 young men from the one, three, and two districts gathered in the auditorium of the county government to swear allegiance to the leader. Commissioner Guo Hongxin of the Second District Supervision Commissioner's Office, County Mayor Li Zhifu, and Liu Jiaoguan Shen and others attended the swearing-in ceremony. After the ceremony, Ding Hongzhang, the principal of the First District Civil School, led the young men to read the oath, which said, "We swear to be sincere and support the leader, and we are willing to dedicate our blood and sweat to the central government, suppress the rebels, and rescue the leader from danger. From the day we take the oath, we are willing to bear the responsibility of rescuing the leader from danger under the unified leadership and command of the central government. Even if we go through fire and water, we will never lag behind. We will never stop until we achieve our goal. This oath." After the oath was taken, Commissioner Guo Hongzhi gave a training speech first, followed by County Mayor Li Zhifu and Liu Jiaoguan Shen, who gave training speeches one after another. The words all encouraged the young men to support the leader and be loyal to the central government, especially when County Mayor Li Zhifu gave a detailed explanation of the Xi'an Incident and Zhang rebel's past behaviors. The words were extremely indignant. The atmosphere in the whole place was very tense, and the emotions were extremely enthusiastic. Finally, Principal Ding led the crowd to shout slogans: (1) Chiang Kai-shek is our only leader, (2) Chiang Kai-shek is the savior of our country, (3) Chiang Kai-shek is the teacher of our people's revival, (4) We must revive the nation, and we must first rescue Chairman Wei from danger, (5) We must save the country, and we must first eliminate the rebels, (6) We must swear to rescue Chairman Wei from danger, (7) Support the leader, (8) Support the central government, (9) Long live the Three Principles of the People, (10) Long live the Republic of China, and other slogans, and then they all returned to their teams at about 11:00.</p>

<p>As the end of December in the national calendar nears, silver and money businesses are starting to close their accounts and are also trying their best to provide loans to facilitate various industries. Today is the Yunnan Uprising Memorial Day, and both Chinese and foreign banks are closed for the day. Detailed information is provided below:</p>
<p>Silver and Money Businesses: Account Closings</p>
<p>Account closings for banks are typically done at the end of June and December. Currently, various banks have started calculating interest for savings deposits on the 20th. Interest calculations for commercial deposits and debts will begin today, with the year-end final account closings scheduled for the end of the month. The Bankers' Association has scheduled a regular meeting of its members for 4 PM on the 29th. Account closings for money businesses are traditionally done at the end of the lunar year; however, starting this year, they will also be done once at the end of the national calendar year. Various firms are already complying. The Money Business Association has scheduled a members' representative meeting for 2 PM on the 31st.</p>
<p>Firms Provide Loans to Facilitate Various Industries</p>
<p>Agricultural products in various regions have had bumper harvests this year, making various industries vibrant, especially the cotton textile industry. Banks and money businesses have generally tightened various loans, both secured and unsecured. However, since the autumn of this year, they have changed their previous methods and have been particularly lenient in providing loans, aiming to facilitate various industries. Loan interest rates have also been slightly reduced compared to the past. Therefore, it is expected that various industries will weather the year steadily without any other concerns.</p>

Labor and management in all industries should share hardships and maintain their livelihoods without causing disputes. This committee (government) is jointly issuing this notice to prevent labor unrest and maintain local security. It is hoped that employers in all industries will uphold the overall situation and not take this opportunity to cut wages or lay off workers, so as not to provide ammunition for critics. Workers in all industries should also not arbitrarily neglect their duties or go on strike. Both sides should uphold a spirit of mutual assistance and resolve disputes amicably. Any lawless individuals who incite labor unrest and endanger order will be immediately and severely arrested without leniency. Everyone must strictly comply and avoid transgressions. This is the notice."</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau Intensifies Anti-Drug Propaganda; Second Day's Situation</h3>

The propaganda methods used were (1) door-to-door persuasion, (2) speeches, and (3) posting or distributing propaganda materials. It is said that the bureau is also planning to hold a large-scale parade in the near future.

(3) Advise landlords and sub-landlords not to rent houses to people who manufacture, sell, or use drugs.

At the same time, they are checking door-to-door to urge smokers who have not renewed their licenses to quickly renew their third-term smoking cessation licenses.</p>
<h3>Anniversary of Tang Youren's Death; His Relatives and Friends Chanting Sutras Today; Inscription of Epitaph Personally Written by Wang Jingwei</h3>
<p>The late Central Committee member Tang Youren was assassinated at his residence in Shanghai on December 25th of last year. Today is the anniversary of his death. Due to the Xi'an Incident, Tang's family did not want to make a big show. Initiated by relatives and friends, they are chanting sutras in commemoration at the Huguo Chan Temple on Mengdelan Road in the British Concession of this city, without holding any other ceremony. The epitaph written by Chairman Wang was sent some time ago. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>(Epitaph for Mr. Youren) Mr. Tang Youren, whose given name was Lin and used his courtesy name, was assassinated at his residence in Shanghai on December 25th of the 24th year of the Republic. He was buried in the Wanguo Public Cemetery in western Shanghai in February of the following year. His family and friends entrusted Zhao Ming with the responsibility of writing the epitaph. I, Zhao Ming, respectfully note that Mr. Tang's given name was Lin, and he used his courtesy name. He was born on the 20th day of the sixth month of the year Jiawu in the 18th year before the Republic, in Xixiang, Liuyang, Hunan. His grandfather's name was Xianchou, courtesy name Shoutian, a famous person in the county, known for his filial piety. His father's name was Caichang, courtesy name Fochen, who died for the cause in Ezhou during the Gengzi Rebellion. His younger brother, Cichen, also died for the cause in Changsha. The heroism of their deaths is recorded in history. Mr. Tang was only seven years old at that time. Mr. Shoutian was poor, but he spared no effort to raise his grandchildren, and he provided food and clothing to revolutionaries who were in danger. His lofty character and sincere actions are detailed in the Biography of Tang Taigong of Liuyang by Xiao Peigen of Taoyuan. Mr. Tang received education from his grandfather when young. From Gengzi to Jiyou, he lived in exile for ten years. During this time, he once went to Japan with his elder brother Guiliang, and entered the Shanghai Sanyu School with his younger brother Bunian. He returned in Gengxu and studied at the Hunan Higher Industrial School. In Xinhai, the Wuchang Uprising occurred, and Jiao Dafeng, Chen Zuoxin, Li Xigui, and other party members responded in Changsha. Mr. Tang was deeply involved in the events. After the first year of the Republic, he studied in Japan, graduating from Keio University in the eighth year. After returning to China, he assisted his brother Guiliang in founding the Yangtze Daily in Hankou. The following year, he traveled north and worked at the Bank of China. Mr. Tang had long specialized in economics and finance, and at this time, he devoted himself to examining the national situation, gaining profound insights. He also worked as a university professor and wrote articles for newspapers, expressing his accumulated knowledge. He was knowledgeable and insightful. The Modern Review, published by Wang Shijie, Zhou Gengsheng, Yang Duanliu, Ding Xielin, and others, was particularly valued by the world. In the 20th year, he was elected as an alternate member of the Central Executive Committee at the Fourth National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang. In the 21st year, he served as the Secretary-General of the Central Political Council in the party headquarters, and as a member of the Legislative Yuan in the government. He then served as the Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At the Fifth National Congress in the 20th year, he was elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee and transferred to the position of Vice Minister of the Ministry of Transportation. During these years, although the country was in deep crisis, Mr. Tang devoted himself to his duties. He particularly worked tirelessly day and night in diplomacy, seeking ways to save the nation. He firmly believed in and adhered to the teachings of Sun Yat-sen regarding the world situation and Sino-Japanese relations. He did his best to implement the decisions of the party headquarters and the government, not avoiding hardship, and not caring about doubts and slanders. China had been weak for a long time, and it was compounded by years of war and chaos. The threat from abroad was imminent. Responding with recklessness would only harm the life of the nation, while enduring with patience would harm the nation's dignity. National strength is accumulated bit by bit and cannot be achieved overnight. Sacrifice cannot be based on empty words. The anxiety in his heart and the depth of his worries could not be fully understood by everyone. His assassination may have been due to the fact that in recent years, he had been constantly concerned about survival and danger. As a negotiator, he could not avoid disappointing some people, which led to this. However, Mr. Tang had long put reputation, life, and death aside. Mr. Tang died at the age of only forty-two. The National Government issued an order to commend his loyalty and gave generous compensation to his family. His wife was Ouyang, the granddaughter of Mr. Ouyang. His sons, Youcheng and Mancheng, and his three daughters, Liancheng, were all young. Mr. Tang was sincere by nature. When his father, Mr. Fochen, entrusted himself to national affairs, he never forgot it. He often told Zhao Ming about the recovery of Changsha in Xinhai, feeling comforted by the fact that he could carry on his father's ambitions. He said that his mother had wept blood for more than ten years, but now she could finally smile for her children. When Mr. Tang was studying in Tokyo, Mr. Huang Xing saw his youthful and vigorous spirit and said with joy and sorrow, "Fochen has an heir, that is for sure." Mr. Tang's actions during his life are detailed in his biography written by his younger brother Bunian, and in the biographical sketch written by his friend Huang Jun. Here, I summarize the major events to mark his grave. Written by Zhao Ming with respect.</p>

<h3>The Dahua Ship Ran Aground But Was Rescued; Shuangqiyang Waters Near Dinghai; Passengers and Crew Rescued and Arrived in Dinghai</h3>
<p>The Dahua ship, owned by the Ping'an Steamship Company and operating on the Shanghai-Taiwan route, weighed 1,071.19 tons, was 199 feet long, 29 feet 1 inch wide, and 18 feet 2 inches deep, with a draft of 13 feet and a speed of 10 nautical miles per hour. On the evening of the 22nd, it departed from Haimen with more than 300 passengers and a large amount of cargo, heading to Shanghai via Shipu, Dinghai, Chuanshan, and other places. At 4 AM on the 23rd, when it reached the Shuangqiyang waters, 60 nautical miles from Dinghai, it suddenly encountered thick fog, causing it to steer off course.</p>
<p>Accidentally Hit a Reef</p>
<p>The ship ran aground on a reef. The area is full of hidden reefs, and the mountain foot extends into the sea. When the ship hit the reef, the hull shook violently. The stern was broken by the reef, and the bottom of the rear hold cracked, allowing seawater to immediately enter. All passengers on board were extremely frightened. The captain urgently sent a distress signal, which was received by the Nanhai ship sailing between Ningbo and Haimen. The Nanhai ship immediately rushed to the Shuangqiyang waters to rescue the Dahua ship. The Nanhai ship anchored in the open sea and launched lifeboats to the Dahua ship. They managed to first rescue all the passengers, more than 300 people, and some of the crew,</p>
<p>Rescued in Succession</p>
<p>and transferred them to the Nanhai ship, which then sailed to Ningbo. They arrived safely in Ningbo yesterday morning. After receiving the telegram from the captain of the Dahua ship, the manager of the Shanghai head office, Li Yaoting, took the Chuanshan ship to Dinghai to assess the situation and prepare for rescue. As there are many pirates in the area and the ship still had cargo, the ship's accountant first arranged for local military police in Dinghai to</p>
<p>Send Ships for Protection</p>
<p>in case of emergency. Although the rear hold was flooded after the ship ran aground, the hull was supported by the reef and did not sink immediately. The first and second holds are said to be intact.</p>
<h3>The Red Cross Transports a Large Number of Medicines to Suiyuan Yesterday; Representatives from Shanxi Come to Shanghai to Collect Them; Yan Fuqing Receives Reports from Suiyuan</h3>
<p>Since the Suiyuan Incident occurred, the local association of the Chinese Red Cross in this city, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and other organizations jointly formed the Suiyuan Bandit Suppression Relief and慰劳Committee, and sent representatives to the front lines to inquire about needed supplies. Yesterday, the committee transported a large number of medicines to General Fu. At the same time, Mr. Yan Fuqing received letters from the front lines reporting on the situation in Suiyuan. Details are provided below:</p>
<p>Special Train Transports to Suiyuan Li Hongwen, the representative of the Taiyuan Pacification Commissioner's Office stationed in Nanjing, sent his son to Shanghai yesterday to collect medicines from the Relief Committee of the Red Cross Society of China. The committee immediately handed over 87,750 packages of first-aid and other medicines, totaling 186 pieces, which were transported to the front lines by several specially prepared train cars attached to two routes for delivery to General Fu. At the same time, the Red Cross Society of China also transported 5,000 packages of injectable medicines and first-aid medicines to the Suiyuan Branch of the Red Cross and the North China Temporary Branch of the Relief Committee for use. According to the association, it has been repeatedly receiving telegrams from the front lines stating that various supplies are urgently needed, and they still hope that all sectors will continue to donate generously.</p>
<p>Reports from the Front Lines Yesterday, Mr. Yan Fuqing received a letter from Dr. Sang Pei'en of the Guisui Mongolian Health Institute, reporting on the situation in Suiyuan. The original letter stated, (omitted above) "The Military Medical Department sent the entire staff of the Fifth Temporary Hospital to Suiyuan the day before yesterday. The hospital is quite large and can accommodate 500 people. Four doctors from Peking Union Medical College have come to assist, so there is no immediate shortage of medical personnel. However, there is still a shortage of medical supplies. I wonder if the General Society can find a way to supplement them. All the lightly wounded soldiers have gradually recovered, and the seriously wounded have also improved. During this period, I am deeply afraid that the wounded soldiers will engage in irregular activities and seek entertainment. Therefore, local colleagues have asked me to solicit various legitimate entertainment items from Shanghai, such as various old books, newspapers, magazines, educational chess pieces, and other game items to relieve boredom. There must be many enthusiastic men and women in Shanghai who are willing to donate. Both new and old items, regardless of type, are very welcome and can be sent directly to the Army-Civilian Joint Entertainment Society, or handed over to me for transfer. It is reported that women in various places are rushing to knit woolen sweaters and other items for the soldiers on the front lines, which is really touching to see the patriotic enthusiasm of the women, but these are not suitable for this place outside the Great Wall. In addition to the large leather jackets and pants produced locally, (large fur coats cost about five yuan each) other cotton and woolen items are not enough to keep out the cold, etc."</p>

<h3>Customs Brokers Association Held a General Meeting Yesterday to Oppose Weighing Goods; Calculating and Paying Waterpower Based on Declared Weight; Shanghai Native Place Associations Association Will Hold a Meeting</h3>
<p>Da Gong She reports that regarding the proposal by the six shipping companies to weigh heavy goods by the Pingzhun Company and charge waterpower based on the weighed tonnage, the Shanghai Native Place Associations Association has published an objection in the newspaper on behalf of the Transportation and Customs Brokers Association. The six companies have also invited Wu Yongxia, a representative of the Native Place Associations Association, and Chen Panjun, a representative of the Customs Brokers Association, to hold a joint meeting at the Shipping Club. It is reported that the Yangtze River branch of the Customs Brokers Association held a general meeting of all members yesterday to discuss the case. Everyone unanimously insisted on calculating and paying waterpower based on the declared and taxed weight, refusing to recognize the weighing by the Pingzhun Company, believing that calculating based on customs weight is fair to all parties. Among the six companies, the three Chinese companies are closer to the customer associations and the customs brokers, and they should uphold the spirit of Chinese business cooperation. Although the idea of promoting domestic goods was expressed with some dissent in the meeting, foreign companies have always set lower waterpower rates for foreign goods than for domestic goods, which shows the intention of foreign merchants to maintain foreign goods. Compared to that, domestic goods are already at a disadvantage in waterpower rates, but Chinese companies have not paid attention to this. Now, a new rule is being created, which seems excessive. No wonder customer associations and customs brokers insist on opposing it. It is also learned that the customer association also plans to convene a meeting within a few days. If it is found out which company initiated the case, they will first try to deal with it in the hope that they will reflect on it.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Foreign Banks Cooperate to Maintain Foreign Exchange Successfully; Finance Minister Kong Thanks Foreign Merchants</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng She reports that since the Xi'an Incident, foreign exchange transactions at the Central, Bank of China, and Communications Bank suddenly increased. At that time, the three banks held a meeting and tried their best to maintain stability. With the cooperation and assistance of the British HSBC and other banks, the foreign exchange transactions continued to be bought and sold without limitation by the three banks based on the past policy of stabilizing foreign exchange. Now that the incident has gradually eased, foreign exchange transactions have returned to their previous state. The daily exchange rate quoted by the Central Bank is one shilling and two and a half pence for the British pound and thirty US dollars for the US dollar, which is the same as the previously set standard. Minister of Finance and Governor of the Central Bank Kong Xiangxi expressed his gratitude to the foreign banks for their kind cooperation and assistance.</p>
<h3>National Goods Movement Federation Held Fourth Executive Committee Meeting Yesterday; Reported on Work and Financial Summary; Family Visits Will Continue</h3>

<h3>Noodles Industry Association Sent Representatives to Petition Yesterday; Social Affairs Bureau Agreed to Provide Relief</h3>
<p>Due to the recent high price of wheat and the low price of rice, the price of flour has more than doubled, which has greatly affected the business of the machine-made noodles industry in this city. It has been difficult to maintain the livelihood of the industry across the city. The Social Affairs Bureau was previously submitted to twice, requesting to suppress the price. Now, because the price of flour and wheat is still rising, the members' meeting again resolved the day before yesterday to nominate Wang Gangwen, Xu Jinfa, Wu Jingeng, etc., to represent the entire industry to petition the Social Affairs Bureau. Yesterday, the representatives took the petition to the bureau to petition. The director sent a clerk, Mr. Song Zhongqing, to receive them. In addition to submitting the petition, Wang Jinwen verbally requested four goals on behalf of the association: (1) Flour is essential to the staple food of civilians. The price increase not only affects the industry's business but also causes panic among civilians across Shanghai. (2) Request to order restrictions on wheat prices, which must not be higher than rice prices. (3) Request to set the price of wheat at no more than six yuan per dan (石) and the price of flour at no more than three yuan per bag. (4) Strictly order the market operating flour and wheat not to monopolize and raise prices. Mr. Song fully accepted the four requests and replied to the representatives that the principles of your association's petition are nothing more than two methods: addressing the symptoms and addressing the root cause. I will convey this to the director and ask to convene a meeting of flour and wheat merchants, such as the Flour Exchange, flour manufacturers, and the Grain Exchange, to discuss relief measures. The representatives were satisfied and returned,</p>

<h3>Buddhist Laymen, etc. Pray for Perfect Merit, Expenses of 2,000 Donated by Initiators, More Than Two Loads of Sandalwood Burned</h3>

<h3>Sujia Railway to Join Through Transport Starting New Year's Day, Approved by Order of the Ministry of Railways</h3>
<p>Since the Sujia Railway officially opened for business on July 15 of this year, all previous through transport of passengers and goods on the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways and domestic through transport, which had to pass through Shanghai, now have a shortcut to pass through.

<h3>Woman's Hospital Burial Case, Appeal Case Adjudicated Yesterday, Male and Female Convicts Claimed No Premeditated Murder, Forensic Doctor Chen Ming Confirmed Both Bodies Had Signs of Strangulation, Judgment Scheduled for the 31st of this Month</h3>
<p>Zhang Wenhua, a local resident, 27 years old, formerly worked as a "宥護"(unclear profession), so he has some medical knowledge. Later, Zhang suddenly used the name of the late Dr. Gu Qing to open the Hongkou Gynecology Hospital at No. 290 Zhaofeng Road, employing Chen Xiaobao (also known as Liang Meiyu and Xu Shuzhen, 25 years old), a woman from this area, as a nurse. They soon became lovers. On the morning of September 4th, Zhang Wenhua suddenly colluded with Chen Xiaobao to</p>
<p>Strangulate Two People</p>
<p>who had abortions, Sichuan woman Lu Aili and man Yu Gengsheng, with gauze, bury the bodies underground, attempting to destroy the evidence and flee. Later, on October 2nd, Hua Detective Huang Fugen and Cui Chengke of the "山稱山"(unclear place) Police Station arrested Zhang and Chen at No. 13, Lane 455, Kangti Road in the French Concession and escorted them to the First Special District Court. After clear confessions, Zhang Wenhua was sentenced to death for joint murder, and Chen Xiaobao was sentenced to life imprisonment for the same crime, both deprived of their civil rights for life. Later, Zhang and Chen refused to accept the verdict and hired Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, and Li Zhongwen. Three lawyers appealed to the High Second Branch Court</p>
<p>Requested an Appeal</p>
<p>Requesting that the original judgment be revoked and a more appropriate judgment be made. The reasons for their appeal have been seen in previous newspapers. At 2:30 p.m. yesterday, Judge Yu Hua, accompanied by Nie and Zhou, two judges, ascended the seat of the First Criminal Court to interrogate the case. The appellants' representatives, attorneys Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, and Li Zhongwen, all arrived on time. First, Judge Yu inquired about Zhang Wenhua's reasons for appealing against the first-instance judgment. According to Zhang, when I was arrested on October 2nd, due to</p>
<p>Unclear Mind</p>
<p>the statements I made may have been incorrect, and because the Western detectives interrogated me and the statements had to be translated, misunderstandings and coercion were unavoidable. Therefore, the statements I made during the initial trial were all untrue. It was not until the last few decisions that I truthfully stated that the woman Lu Ai died because of careless use of instruments during the abortion, causing the uterus to rupture and blood to flow into the abdomen. At that time, the man Yu Gengsheng, who came with her, had a major dispute with me. In order to save the woman, I drew blood from the man. Unexpectedly, the father was caused to</p>
<p>Surgery Carelessly</p>
<p>Air entered the blood vessels and caused death. There was no premeditated murder. Moreover, the deceased were unknown to me and there was no grievance between us. Why would I have to murder them? This point can be requested from the forensic doctor to examine the body to see if there are any poisonous juices or drugs in the body, and it will be clear. As for the gauze wrapped around the neck of the body, it was completely to prevent the odor from overflowing and there was no other reason, and so on. When questioned, Chen Xiaobao stated that I am a nurse, and later became acquainted with Zhang Wenhua. All</p>
<p>Everything</p>
<p>was done by Zhang personally. I did not assist in the conspiracy. Moreover, I worked as a nurse in Guangci Hospital for only three months, so I do not have any medical knowledge, etc. Then, the fourth lawyers of the appellant, Yu Enliang and Li Zhongwen, stood up and stated that it should be requested to consult the forensic doctor again as to whether the deceased died from poisonous drugs or strangulation. The court then summoned forensic doctor Zhang to the case, who stated that the woman's death was</p>
<p>Related to Abortion</p>
<p>Because her uterus had broken, she was bound to die. She was then strangled to death with a rope. The man's body appeared to have been strangled based on surface inspection, because there was gauze around his neck and there were strangulation marks. As for whether there were poisonous juices in his body, it was not possible to know because there was no autopsy, and so on. Judge Yu ordered that</p>
<p>Debate Began</p>
<p>Police Lawyer Gan Jingxian stated that the original sentence of the first instance in this case was not inappropriate and should be rejected and the original judgment maintained. Then, after the appellants' representatives Yu, Fan, and Li. Three lawyers debated, the court debate ended, and the judgment was scheduled to be announced at 2 p.m. on the 31st of this month. Zhang Wenhua and Chen Xiaobao were still returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Yu Wenlin Sues for False Imprisonment; Xing Zhigang and Others Not Guilty; Yu's Transfer to Xiqin Institute Was an Administrative Punishment; Lawsuit Invalid, Should Appeal to Higher Authority</h3>
<p>Xing Zhigang, the district chief of the fifth district of Chenjiaxing Town in Pudong, Shanghai County, Shi Konghuai, the secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Utilities Bureau, Gao Shu'an, the deputy director of the Wharf Management Office, and Wang Jun, an inspector, were sued by Yu Wenlin, also known as Yu A-si, in the local court by Zhou Yingjie and Zhou Yingcai, two lawyers. Xing Zhigang, in the name of the shipping association, allegedly instigated Wang Jun to arrest Yu and take him to the Wharf Management Office, from where Gao Shu'an sent him to the Caoxi River vagrant labor institution via Shi Konghuai, falsely accusing him of</p>
<p>Collecting Illegal Fees</p>
<p>at the wharf.</p>
<p>However, the plaintiff claims to be a watchman hired by various shipping companies, exchanging labor for money, and requests that the defendants be punished for false imprisonment and defamation, and that he be released from the institution. He was summoned for questioning, but because Yu was still at the institute, the court ordered a postponement. Yesterday, Judge Yu Lude continued the trial, with the official arguing from the plaintiff's lawyer's statement that, "This morning, the court ordered the bailiff to go to the Xiqin Institute to bring Yu Wenlin, but they have not been able to bring him yet. According to the bailiff, he can only be brought at noon. Now, let us first question the defendants."</p>
<p>Shi Minhuai Testified:</p>
<p>Age 39, from Haimen, Secretary of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and concurrently the Director of the Wharf Management Office, residing at 92 Longmen Village. I am responsible for the wharf warehouse. Daily and special matters are handled by the Director of the Bureau.

<p>More than Sixty Establishments</p>
<p>Totaling over one hundred dollars. Because this violated Article 16 of the Wharf Regulations, Vice Director Gao and Wang Jun brought him to the Management Office. Yu admitted his wrongdoing, so according to Article 7 of the Wharf Regulations, he was sent to the Vagrant Labor Institute. At this point, Gao Shu'an testified that after bringing in Yu, they found that Yu had committed a criminal offense before, as proven by a letter from the Yangjing Security Corps. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that, regarding the information in the Security Corps' letter, the plaintiff had stated that the Security Corps had</p>
<p>Falsely Accused Him of Theft</p>
<p>and that the High Court had acquitted him, so this evidence is not credible. At this point, the official ordered that Yu Wenlin be brought in and the trial would resume at 2 p.m. In the afternoon, after Yu Wenlin was brought in, Judge Yu continued the trial with all defendants present. Yu Wenlin, also known as Yu A-si, testified that he was 42 years old, from Dongtai, residing at 52 Laobaidu, Pudong, had previously rowed boats, and that since June 20th of this year, he has been working as a night watchman for ships, not insurance, but rather that the wharf owners at Gongyi Wharf</p>
<p>Voluntarily Paid</p>
<p>him. This small book is mine, and the one hundred plus dollars in it are what the ship owners gave me, one or two dollars each. I have no grudges against the Wharf Management Office, the local inspectors, or Xing Zhigang. That day, Inspector Wang called me ashore and immediately arrested me and took me to the Management Office, and sent me to the Xiqin Institute. At this point, Xing Zhigang testified that someone was impersonating me and extorting money from ship owners. The water patrol team wrote to me, saying they had captured Yu A-si. I said not to deal with it. I am the district chief, I have no time to advise. At this point, the official began the debate. The defendant's lawyer, Li Zuyu, argued that one could collect over two hundred dollars in insurance fees per month, and that there would be danger if one did not pay, so it can be seen that it was</p>
<p>Not Voluntary.</p>
<p>Moreover, this punishment, based on the management regulations, sent him to the Vagrant Labor Institute for rehabilitation, not imprisonment. The lawsuit is therefore invalid. The judge declared the debate closed and announced the verdict that the defendants were all not guilty. Yu Wenlin was sent back to the Xiqin Institute, and it was ordered that this was an administrative punishment and could only be appealed to the higher authorities of the original punishment. The lawsuit was not legal. The court then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Disputes Arise Again at Longhua Temple; Ten Directions Monks Accuse Yuanming; Accuse Yuanming of Controlling Temple Property with Secretive Actions; Allege Buddhist Instruments, Religious Items, and Silk Fabrics All Sold Off; Chinese Buddhist Association Sends Letter to Shanghai Branch for Handling</h3>
<p>Longhua Temple in this city is a famous ancient temple. Since the former abbot, Yuanzhao, was accused of selling temple property by the succeeding abbot, Xingkong, a lawsuit arose in the Shanghai Local Court and disputes occurred repeatedly. This year, Xingkong resigned again, and the temple elected Yuanming to succeed him. In September of this year, the Shanghai Buddhist Association went to take over, but this did not materialize. Now, more than ten monks from the ten directions, including Yueqiao, have filed a complaint with the Chinese Buddhist Association accusing Yuanming of controlling temple property. The association has forwarded it to the Shanghai Buddhist Association for handling together. The Datong News Agency reporter has recorded the original complaint and official letter below.</p>
<p>Monk Yueqiao, et al., Submit a Complaint</p>
<p>A document from the ten-direction monks Yueqiao et al. to the Chinese Buddhist Association states: "Regarding the matter of an inferior monk controlling the temple, which has become bankrupt, requesting a ruling for relief. Longhua Temple is an ancient temple of thousands of years. Since Xingkong retreated and requested that your Association elect a worthy successor, Yuanming and a group of Sichuan monks have taken the position of abbot and expelled monks from other provinces who were staying there. The ten-direction monastery has become the private property of Sichuan people, and their conduct speaks for itself. Yueqiao and others further investigated the temple and found that its actions were secretive, disorderly, and</p>
<p>Refused to Accept the Abbot Selected by Your Association, Rejecting them twice and resorting to violence at every turn, making their arrogance evident. Yueqiao and others, as members of the Longhua staff and as Buddhists, could not bear to sit idly by for the sake of preserving the ancient temple of thousands of years, and were therefore compelled to speak out. Hereby, they present a list of their illegal actions and the bankruptcy situation, as stated on the left: (1) Closing the mountain gate tightly and secretly constructing hidden doors behind the abbot's residence and the supervisor's residence, making their whereabouts secretive. (2) The temple's property has all been mortgaged. The temple rooms east of the gate are mortgaged to the residents. (3) They have entered into contracts with people to privately sell the temple's annual income from tin foil, fire wax, and candles. (4) All the solemn religious instruments in the temple have been pawned. (5) A set of red satin embroidered Buddha canopies, four in total, worth five to six hundred dollars, donated by layman Zhang Xiaolin, have already been pawned, along with hundreds of beds, Buddhist instruments, religious items, bronze stoves, and many vestments used for Buddhist ceremonies, as well as furniture items, and wooden items purchased for over one thousand and forty dollars during this year's precepts period, all have been pawned and sold off, and hidden elsewhere. What is the intention behind these actions? Are they intentionally planning to abscond with the temple's funds, or do they have other intentions? It is difficult to guess. Longhua is an ancient temple of thousands of years, a monastery of the ten directions, now being ravaged and plundered by Yuanming and the supervisor Xinghui. Not only is it destroying the Buddha Dharma, but it is also harming public morals day by day. We petition that your Association, as the highest group and organization of Buddhism, is responsible for guiding and protecting the Buddha Dharma and temple property. Therefore, we humbly request that your Association promptly send personnel to investigate and refer the matter to government agencies for legal sanctions to maintain the temple property and protect the ancient temple. The merit is immeasurable. Presented to the Chinese Buddhist Association. Presented by the representatives of the ten directions, Shengzhi, Yueqiao, Bensen, Cizheng, Yongjian, Manyue, Zhikai, Hongjing, Benwu, Guangli, Shanxiang, Ruhai, Shiyin, Yuansheng, Zhihui, Yuxiu, Ji Hui."</p>
<p>Chinese Buddhist Association Letter</p>
<p>According to the submission of the Chinese Buddhist Association, a public letter to the Shanghai Buddhist Association states: "The Chairman has forwarded a complaint from Monk Yueqiao, et al., and Lu Mingzhao, the representative of the Longhua Temple's Shan Lord, regarding the inferior monk occupying Longhua, selling off temple property, and requesting a ruling for relief, etc. The Longhua Temple incident is currently being handled by your Association, and we believe you should copy the original complaint and send it for reference, and we hope that you will report the handling situation to this Association at any time. This is addressed to the Shanghai Branch, Secretariat of the Chinese Buddhist Association."</p>
<h3>American Trading Company Representative to Arrive in Shanghai Soon; Will Purchase as Many Chinese Goods for Export as Possible</h3>
<p>Mr. Leo Jesfsberg, a famous merchant from New York, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on January 5th of next year. He is the general manager of the American Trading Company, a well-known firm in New York. The company is a joint venture between Mr. Jessberg and Mr. Greenberg and is now one of the largest importing firms in the United States. Its branch offices are located all over the world. In addition to purchasing all kinds of goods manufactured in various parts of the world in large quantities, the company is also happy to be the first to introduce any new products suitable for sale in the US and Canadian markets to people in those countries. Therefore, the company is not only an importer but also an entrepreneur. Mr. Jessberg is a talented man in the business world, shrewd, capable, enterprising, optimistic, fond of traveling, and fluent in twelve languages. He has been paying attention to the East for five years. In addition to three branch offices already established in Yokohama, Kobe, and other places in Japan, the company has also established a branch office at 467 Jiangxi Road, Shanghai, in July of this year to purchase various Chinese manufactured products for sale in those countries. Because the company has many branch offices, sales are extremely convenient, so all goods are purchased in large quantities. Since the establishment of the branch office in Shanghai, it has become increasingly convenient to export Chinese manufactured products to the United States and Canadian markets. It is said that Mr. Jessberg's visit to Shanghai will not be delayed much. During his stay in Shanghai, he is very willing to have Chinese merchants and major manufacturers bring various samples of goods to the branch office on Jiangxi Road for negotiations, so that he can purchase as much as possible. It is also said that Mr. J. Rechter, the company's Far East purchasing agent, will accompany Mr. Jessberg. Mr. Rechter is the representative stationed in Shanghai and is well known to manufacturers in Shanghai and other ports.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Dispatches Plane to Distribute Lottery Tickets and Flyers</h3>
<p>The 30th period of the National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery has been scheduled to be drawn publicly at Yiyuan, 16 Yierdu Road, French Concession, on January 8th, 1937. It is reported that the China National Aviation Corporation, in order to assist with publicity and to attract the attention of people from all walks of life, has specially dispatched an airplane to carry flyers and distribute them to various ports. It is planned that on November 15th, it will fly to Haizhou, Qingdao, Beiping, and Tianjin; on the 26th, it will fly to Hankou, Shashi, Yichang, Wanxian, Chongqing, Chengdu, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangzhou; and on January 3rd, it will return to Shanghai to distribute them. Before the plane departed, the lottery ticket office sent telegrams to the authorities of various cities and counties to inform them.</p>
<h3>City Taxi Drivers Demand Improved Treatment</h3>
<p>The taxi driver workers in the city, in view of the harsh treatment and the fact that their monthly wages are all below thirty yuan, resulting in insufficient income to maintain daily life, the Shanghai Automobile Driver's Professional Union held an emergency meeting and decided to demand improved treatment. The working hours must not exceed twelve hours per day. The tip should be one yuan per car, and the gas tip should be two jiao, to be determined by the company. The union submitted the request to the trade association for negotiation, but it was ineffective. It has now formally presented it to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Department, requesting a swift mediation. As for the Yunfei workers, they have requested that their wages be increased to forty yuan per month.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Bus Employees' Demand; Social Affairs Bureau Mediation Ineffective</h3>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Bus Company employees demanded double pay at the end of the year (that is, an annual bonus). After some employees went on strike and refused to sell tickets, fortunately, the Party and government authorities persuaded them to return to their original state. The Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon at 2 pm convened labor and management for mediation. Mao Xinhui, the executive director of the Sixth District Bus Industry Professional Union, Liu Shouchun, the director, Huang Zhongwen, the general manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council Bus Company, Shi Ti, the head of the Transportation Department, and the social affairs coordinator of the Social Affairs Bureau were present. As the mediator, Zai Zhusun, was on leave, Zhu Quantao acted as chairman, and Jiang Shifu recorded the minutes. First, the management representative stated that the company's business has been repeatedly affected by the current situation, resulting in losses, and it is really impossible to bear the employee's annual bonus of one month's salary. He had explained the company's difficulties to the union director, but had not been understood. On the morning of the 23rd, the ticket sellers on each bus route went on strike and refused to sell tickets, causing unexpected losses to the company. It should be severely punished. Then, the labor representative stated that the employees' year-end bonus has been distributed every year, such as one month last year and twenty-three last year. This year, the company suddenly refused to issue it, and negotiations were ineffective, resulting in a strike. Fortunately, after trying their best to persuade them, they immediately returned to work. After the chairman's repeated persuasion, the management was still willing to issue a ten-day annual bonus, but it must be paid next year. The labor side conceded the annual bonus to twenty days, which must be issued this year, resulting in ineffective mediation. It was announced that the director would be consulted before proceeding with the review. The meeting adjourned at around 4 pm.</p>
<h3>China Match Factory All Workers Strike</h3>
<p>The China Match Factory in Pingjiangqiao, Zhabei, this city, has a total of more than five hundred male and female workers. Recently, a labor dispute arose because the workers demanded meal money during the shutdown period. After the Federation of Trade Unions sent someone to mediate, the factory agreed to pay each male worker one yuan and six jiao, but refused to pay the female workers. The workers were still dissatisfied. At 10 a.m. the day before yesterday, Wu Alian, a female worker in the factory's box department, was found by Shen Jingren, an employee of the factory, to have used the paste prepared in the factory, and was immediately notified to be suspended for a week. Wu expressed her dissatisfaction because she used very little paste and argued with the factory, requesting that the order be revoked. Later, the factory changed the fine to three boxes of matches for Wu's salary (120 boxes per box, totaling only four and a half cents in national currency). Wu was still dissatisfied, and the workers were usually dissatisfied with Shen's abuse of workers, so they believed that Shen was causing trouble, so they joined forces to help. All five hundred workers in the factory suddenly went on strike, demanding that the factory cancel Wu Alian's fine and replace Shen Jingren. Because the factory director, Pan Guiru, had gone to other ports to promote sales and no one was responsible, there was no result. The workers continued to strike yesterday and, at 10 a.m., sent representatives Tao Shubao and Wu Xiaolan to the Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Party Department, and the Federation of Trade Unions to petition, demanding that the factory be ordered to accept the conditions this time, and requesting that the decision to resolve the meal money for male and female workers during the shutdown period be resolved uniformly. After the Party and government agencies were petitioned, they all persuaded the workers to resume work first and wait for legal mediation.</p>

The police station ordered the arrest of the perpetrator. It was discovered the day before yesterday by Detective Xiang that the perpetrator was Shen Xijin (age 27), a local resident living at 94 Vermon Road. He was arrested at that address and sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday. Judge Chen Shuoying questioned him. Chen Ming, the lawyer from the Police Department, stated that the victim is still in the hospital for treatment and that the reason for the perpetrator's actions needs to be investigated in detail. He requested a postponement. After verifying the confession in court, the defendant Shen Xisheng was questioned. He denied splashing acid. The court ordered that the hearing be rescheduled for the 29th. The defendant was remanded in custody, and a forensic doctor will be sent to Guangci Hospital to examine the victim's injuries for further verification.</p>
<h3>Two Peddlers Commit Suicide Together; One Dies, One Survives</h3>
<p>Zhou Xianbo (age 44), a local, and Shen Meisheng (age 37) were both peddlers. For unknown reasons, the two men decided to commit suicide together. On the afternoon of the 23rd, they purchased raw opium and went to the Huashang Inn at 140 Mofang Street, French Concession, and opened room number one, ostensibly to stay overnight. They divided the opium and ate it to commit suicide. After taking it, the two slept together in one bed, waiting for death to come. At 10 a.m. yesterday, Wang Qingfu, a waiter from Ningbo, went upstairs to urge the lodgers to get up and heard vomiting and moaning from room number one. He entered the room and found that Zhou had died in bed. Shen was vomiting and moaning incessantly. There were six small boxes of opium (two jiao each) on the table in front of the bed. Knowing that they had taken poison, he immediately reported it to the French police station, who sent detectives to investigate. Shen was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment, and Zhou's body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Parlor for an autopsy. No family members were found. A request was made today to the Second Special District Court to send someone to conduct an autopsy. Shen is expected to recover after treatment, but the reason why the two men committed suicide together is unknown and will be clarified after Shen is discharged from the hospital and questioned.</p>

<h3>General Overview of Education in Jiangxi Province in the 24th Year of the Republic</h3>
<p>The following is a summary of the general overview of education in Jiangxi Province in the 24th year of the Republic, based on the results of the survey. The province's educational expenses for the 24th year of the Republic were 2,100,002 yuan, distributed as follows: Agricultural College 15 yuan, accounting for 37.14 percent (hereinafter, the word "percent" is omitted); Specialized Schools 1,658,307 yuan, accounting for 7.89; Middle Schools 408,234 yuan, accounting for 19.42; Vocational Schools 218,292 yuan, accounting for 10.18; Normal Schools 309,645 yuan, accounting for 4.73; Studying Abroad 18,290 yuan, accounting for 5.63; Social Education 123,562 yuan, accounting for 5.88; Provincial Elementary Schools 372,506 yuan, accounting for 17.72; Subsidies, Stipends, and Awards 100,000 yuan, accounting for 4.76; Affiliated Institutions 10,032 yuan, accounting for 0.48; Educational Miscellaneous Expenses 46,852 yuan, accounting for 2.23; and Institutional Construction 78,757 yuan, accounting for 3.74. The county educational expenses for the 24th year of the Republic were 1,041,890 yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding compulsory education in elementary education, there were 5,900 schools, 244,645 students, and 2,022,704 yuan in expenses in the 22nd year of the Republic. In the latter half of the 23rd year of the Republic, the number of schools increased by 2,776, the number of students increased by 139,940, and the expenses increased by 656,731 yuan. In the first half of the 24th year of the Republic, the number of schools increased by 10,192, the number of students increased by 498,575, and the expenses for supporting education increased by 1,580,604 yuan. Compared with the figures for the 22nd year of the Republic, both the number of schools and the number of students have more than doubled. It is estimated that there are more than 25,000 schools throughout the province, and 4,000 new schools are established each year. It is hoped that compulsory education will be universal in the province after five years. There are 37 elementary schools with 236 classes and 11,376 students in the provincial capital. In addition, there are 13 schools affiliated with the Provincial Normal School and the Provincial Central Elementary School, with 102 classes and 4,607 students.</p>
<p>Regarding secondary education, there are 35 public and private middle schools with 9,587 students, 14 normal schools with 2,175 students, and 15 vocational schools with 1,661 students. The province's policy for secondary education is to limit the establishment of new schools and, depending on local needs, convert them into vocational or rural normal schools. On the one hand, the content of existing middle schools is improved, and on the other hand, vocational and normal education facilities are expanded as much as possible. Therefore, the number of middle schools has been decreasing since the 21st year of the Republic, and vocational and normal schools have been built to fill the void.</p>
<p>Regarding higher education, there are specialized schools, including the provincial agricultural, medical, and technological schools. In the 23rd year of the Republic, the agricultural school was transferred to the provincial agricultural college. In the 24th year of the Republic, there were 281 students in the two specialized schools. As for studying abroad, there was one student studying engineering in the United States and one student studying medicine.</p>
<p>Regarding various social education endeavors, in addition to establishing a music education committee, expanding the provincial sports field, enriching the provincial science museum, and reorganizing the provincial library and civic education center, efforts have been made to promote civic education, including organizing itinerant education film groups, promoting radio education, vigorously carrying out popular lectures, unifying the training of people's work, compiling people's reading materials, establishing itinerant people's schools, and short-term elementary schools in the provincial capital. Furthermore, progress has been made in scouting training and the promotion of music education, health education, the implementation of civic training in the provincial capital, the promotion of simplified education in the provincial capital, and the organization of youth new life labor service groups.</p>

<h3>Preparation for the Alumni Association of the National Research Institute</h3>
<p>Previously, universities in China established various research institutes one after another in order to pursue advanced academic research. However, the administrative system has always belonged to the university headquarters, and there has been a lack of organizational connections between the various research institutes. Since the Ministry of Education promulgated the Research Institute Organization Law two years ago, research institutes have reached an independent status and are the highest stage in the academic system. More than 30 research institutes have been registered with the Ministry of Education. In order to promote academic cooperation and emotional connections between the various institutes, the Alumni Association of the National Sun Yat-sen University Research Institute plans to initiate a National Research Institute Alumni Association. It is reported that it has already begun to investigate the situation of new and old alumni in various research institutes across the country, as well as their opinions on the organization of the association. Once the investigation is completed, it plans to start the process immediately.</p>

<p>Special Issue Commemorating the Fourth Anniversary of New Cosmos Vocational School, Middle School, Elementary School, and Second Elementary School</p>
<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xinbo</p>
<p>Our school was established four years ago in the blink of an eye. During these four years, thanks to the guidance and supervision of the educational authorities, the support and encouragement of people from all walks of life, and the hard work and cooperation of the school board, faculty, and students, we have achieved today's results. Such as expanding school buildings, enriching equipment, adding departments, increasing classes, raising the level of students, paying attention to student training, conducting research work, and promoting supplementary education, although it has been a difficult creation and a painstaking management, all the progress has been in accordance with the predetermined plan, resolutely implemented, and has been filed with the Shanghai Education Bureau and the Ministry of Education, which is what Xinbo and others are comforted by.</p>
<p>However, the education cause is a century-long plan. The future of New Cosmos is just beginning. In the future, we should work harder to raise funds to build new school buildings, continue to enrich equipment, and strive for progress as needed by the times, in order to make greater contributions to the future of education in our country and the revival of the nation. Zhuangzi said: "The beginning is simple, but the end will be great." It is even more necessary for the educational authorities to continue their guidance and supervision, for people from all walks of life to enthusiastically support and encourage, and for the school board, faculty, and students to work harder and cooperate.</p>
<p>As the fourth anniversary approaches, we are compiling and printing a special issue, briefly describing the past situation, the current state, and the future plans of our school, in order to seek correction from the virtuous and wise of the world, and also to commemorate the past and encourage the future.</p>
<h3>New Cosmos in the Past Four Years</h3>
<p>— (Zhang Zhonghuan)</p>
<p>"New Cosmos" has been around for four years since it was born. Taking advantage of the fourth anniversary, I will make a brief description of the progress in the past four years, which is also to review the implementation of the past and encourage the efforts of the future.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the Board Jiang Wenyu</h3>
<p>(1) The Purpose of Founding the School</p>
<p>(1) School education should strive for universality; however, there are few schools in our country, and less than 20% of children attend school. Our school is to run a school with private funds to supplement the inadequacy of national education. And to seek the quantitative development of education.</p>
<p>(2) There are very few schools in our country that meet the standards and are well-managed, and it is very appropriate to run a private school. At present, due to the limitations of manpower and financial resources, our school is inevitably simple and crude, and is still far from the ideal standard, but we always hope to make progress step by step and become an ideal and perfect private school, and to seek the qualitative improvement of education.</p>
<h3>Founder and Principal Zhang Bo</h3>
<p>(3) Educational ideals and teaching methods must rely on practical experience to be effective. However, public schools are often affected by the situation and restricted by laws and regulations, and cannot have the slightest freedom; our school can make appropriate adjustments under the national education policy and regulations, in order to better adapt to the actual situation. And test the actual problems of education.</p>
<p>(4) Middle school graduates often lack considerable knowledge and skills, and cannot adapt to the needs of society, and their character and temperament flow into frivolousness and laziness; if the school has one more graduate, society will add one unemployed person, and the family will have one less useful child? It will be seen that the more popular education is, the greater the harm to public and private life. If we want to realize the claim of education to save the country, we must correct this malpractice, promote vocational education, and pay attention to production training. This is why our school has the motivation to found a vocational school.</p>
<h3>Founder and Principal Zhang Zhonghuan</h3>

<p>(3) Material Enrichment</p>
<p>(1) Expansion of School Buildings The school building in the second semester of the twenty-first year was on Lafayette Road, Lafayette Lane, which was very small. From the twenty-second year, it moved to the intersection of Pike Road and Special Road, and added two dormitories nearby. In the twenty-third year, the original site on Pike Road was used exclusively for elementary school, and the vocational school was moved to the intersection of Jianwei Road and Kangti Road, and a dormitory was rented nearby, and the first elementary school was added. In the twenty-fourth year, because the place was small and insufficient to accommodate, and could not be developed, the vocational school and the second elementary school were moved to the current address at No. 270 Chongqing Road. In the first semester, a Western-style house at No. 112 Weihaiwei Road was rented as a lower-grade classroom for the elementary school. This semester, a new auditorium was built, which can accommodate 700 to 800 people.</p>
<p>(2) Increase in School Equipment The school equipment has been added year by year to meet actual needs; since the increase in the number of people from 1931, more has been added. In terms of teaching equipment, such as new-style iron-legged desks and chairs, standard blackboards, pianos, organs, Chinese and English typewriters, computers, arithmetic teaching aids, history and geography maps, natural science maps, and military toys for children, everything has been enriched.</p>
<p>Part of the Faculty and Students of Our School (Half of it was cut off due to the relationship of the manufacturing relationship)</p>
<p>(3) Addition of Books In addition to the donation of more than 2,000 books by the founder, the school also designates special funds every semester to add books. Recently, the elementary school has also ordered the Elementary School Student Library, the Children's Library, the Elementary School Student Supplementary Readers, the Little Friend's Library, and the Elementary School Textbooks and Small World for each subject. The vocational school has reordered the Twenty-Five Histories, the Congshu Jicheng, the Wanyou Wenku, the First and Second Series, the Ministry of Publications, the Chemical Industry Series, the Junior High School Student Library, the Basic Knowledge Series, and many other great works.</p>
<p>(4) Increase in Instruments The school already has a rough model for physics instruments, chemical instruments and reagents, and museum specimens. Due to the addition of senior grades and the addition of applied chemistry departments, the instruments and reagents have been added to a greater extent. In the future, it is planned to increase purchases year by year to gradually achieve perfection.</p>
<p>(5) Expansion of Practice Since the school added the business department, it has paid attention to commercial practice, and has successively added practice shops, practice banks, commodity showrooms, Chinese and English typing rooms, and statistical practice rooms for students to study, practice, and practice on weekdays; in recent years, it has gradually tried to enrich them. The shops and banks are roughly scaled, and the commodity showroom is divided into two parts, domestic goods and foreign goods, for research and identification. There are currently six Chinese typewriters and twenty-four English typewriters. In the future, it is planned to add several more machines each semester, so that students can have more opportunities to practice; it is planned to go to several large companies and banks to allow students to have the opportunity to practice on the spot before graduation (in recent years, they have practiced in the Commercial Press and Zhonghua Book Company, etc., and the results are very good, and have been praised). As for the applied chemistry department, in the autumn of the twenty-third year, it jointly established a factory with the Oriental Instrument Company at Gaochang Temple Xinzhaozhou Road in Nanshi, which is divided into woodworking, casting, forging, fitter, and metalworking workshops for students to practice. Last year, the school building was moved, which was inconvenient for commuting. In addition to doing a long-term practice in the factory before graduation, another workshop was opened in the school, which is divided into two parts: metal and woodworking and applied chemistry workshops. All the workshop equipment is also gradually added to make it complete.</p>
<p>(4) Content Improvement</p>
<p>(1) Improving the Level of Students In recent years, schools at all levels often focus on form and activities, resulting in a general downward trend in the level of students. Therefore, the school pays great attention to the compilation of the curriculum, the distribution of teaching materials, and the selection of textbooks; it also pre-orders outlines of the curriculum for each subject, improves the teaching methods for each subject, encourages teachers to continue their studies; and pays serious attention to the examination of grades, extracurricular research, teaching equipment, and guidance on study and career; therefore, the level of students is gradually improving.</p>
<p>(2) Training Professional Knowledge and Skills The vocational school pays special attention to the training of professional knowledge and skills. Such as emphasizing practice and exercises, conducting professional lectures, and conducting special research, etc., to ensure that students have specialized knowledge and skills after graduation, not enough to make a living for individuals, but enough to revive the country and the people.</p>
<p>(3) Determining Training Objectives The school deeply feels that the scope of education is not only to impart knowledge, so it attaches great importance to student training on weekdays. Looking at the general public in our country, they are ignorant and ignorant, and most of them have four common problems: "poverty", "weakness", "selfishness", and "scattered"; therefore, the school's training objectives are to cultivate production knowledge and skills, to forge a sound physique, to cultivate a noble personality, and to pay attention to discipline training, in order to remedy the withering of the people's livelihood, the weakness of the physique, the lack of public morality, and the scattered spirit; and in the implementation of this, based on the psychology of young people and children, we pay attention to personality influence and adopt positive guidance to train sound citizens.</p>
<p>(4) Cultivating Patriotic Spirit In recent times, the people's morale has been low and life has been decadent. Most people only know how to be selfish and self-interested, and follow the old ways. They lack the ability to be confident and self-aware, and they have no spirit of sacrifice and struggle, which has led to the weakening of national power and the urgency of foreign insults. The nation-state is in danger. Therefore, the school trains children and young people. Whether in teaching or guidance, we focus on cultivating students' national consciousness and patriotic spirit, so that they become loyal, courageous, striving, sacrificing, and public-spirited citizens, so that they can save the country and revive the nation.</p>
<h3>Gate</h3>
<p>(5) Paying Attention to Teaching Research The school was founded in order to engage in educational research and experimentation; however, in the past four years, we are ashamed that there are no concrete and satisfactory results. Recently, we are conducting investigations, visits, discussions, and experiments on the curriculum, teaching, equipment, and training; and we are starting to compile the New Cosmos Vocational Series, the New Cosmos Children's Series, and the National Hero Stories Series.</p>
<p>(5) Future Plans</p>
<p>(1) Raising Funds to Build New School Buildings The school site of the middle and elementary school departments is less than 1 mu, and there are only a few hundred school buildings. There are more than 900 students, and we feel that there is no room to accommodate them. Therefore, to make progress, we must raise funds to build new school buildings. In the future, it is planned to use the original vocational school and the second elementary school site exclusively for junior high school and the second elementary school, and then purchase 50 mu of land in the suburbs of Shanghai to build a classroom, two dormitories, an auditorium, and a factory, which is expected to cost 200,000 yuan and can accommodate 1,500 students, so as to become a more perfect vocational school. Before the purchase of land and construction are completed, we must still expand the school buildings to facilitate development.</p>
<h3>One of the School Views</h3>
<p>(2) Enriching Necessary Equipment The school has been adding equipment as much as possible every semester; in recent years, due to the increase in students, all desks, chairs, cabinets, books, instruments, and business practice equipment, applied agricultural science practice workshops, etc., have been purchased in large quantities, but this is still not enough to be considered rich; in the future, we must still allocate large sums of money every year and request subsidies from the Ministry of Education, specifically for the purchase of books, instruments, and commercial and applied chemistry practice equipment, etc., in order to exceed the standards set by the Ministry within three years and reach a perfect state.</p>
<p>(3) Adding Departments and Classes The school's vocational middle school currently has eleven classes. In the future, it is planned to add a civil engineering department, aiming to reach eighteen classes, so that the applied chemistry department, business department, and civil engineering department will all complete six grades each for senior and junior high school; each grade of junior high school will reach three grades, totaling nine grades; the New Cosmos Elementary School plans to gradually increase to ten grades, that is, eight grades for the first-grade dual-grade elementary school and two grades for senior high school; the second elementary school plans to increase to two grades in kindergarten and each grade of elementary school will reach three grades, totaling twenty grades; the total number of students will be 2,000.</p>
<p>(4) Promoting Supplementary Education Education is one of the social undertakings. The facilities of the school should be integrated with the society. If we run the school behind closed doors, it is definitely not the essence of education. Therefore, the school has always attached great importance to promoting supplementary education, and has held vocational supplementary schools in recent years, such as the Mandarin Specialization Department, the English Specialization Department, the Japanese Specialization Department, the Arithmetic Specialization Department, the Women's Supplementary Department, the Shop Assistant's Supplementary Department, the Chinese and English Typing Department, and the Chinese Shorthand Department, etc., and the tuition fees charged are very low. However, due to focusing on the progress of vocational middle school and elementary school, the supplementary school has not been able to make much progress. In the future, we must pay more attention to it in order to promote it and strive for popularization.</p>
<p>However, after four years of hard work and struggle, and painstaking management, New Cosmos has grown from a low-level single-grade elementary school to now having a kindergarten, a first elementary school, a second elementary school, a junior high school, and a junior and senior vocational school; from one class to now having twenty-nine classes; from more than twenty students to now having more than nine hundred students; from two teachers to now having more than sixty teachers; the speed of progress is truly amazing! However, the education cause is a century-long plan. The future development is great. In order to make a slight contribution to the nation and the country, we rely more on the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life and the school board, and the joint efforts of teachers, staff, and students.</p>

<h3>The Recent Price Drops Were Too Sharp: Half of This Month's Forward Contracts Temporarily Withdrawn</h3>
<p>Cotton Market Rebounds: Today is the last day for this month's contracts. According to market sources, merchants who had committed to deliver tens of thousands of bales at around 42 yuan per bale have withdrawn and will not deliver. Consequently, the amount of available cotton has decreased, causing the market to tighten and prices to rise again. However, spot cotton trading remains sluggish. The closing price for this month is 42.90 yuan, an increase of 1.70 yuan compared to last month.</p>
<p>Single Month Sees a Rise of 1.50 Yuan</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Market Opens: This month's trading concludes tomorrow. It's reported that some 20,000 bales were originally scheduled for delivery, but due to price declines, deliveries have been withdrawn. Simultaneously, favorable conditions in the English cotton market have boosted confidence. However, market trading is not smooth. The final spot price for this month is up 0.15 yuan from yesterday's closing price, while the forward price is down 0.10 yuan. The afternoon session opened, rising in line with the yarn market. At the same time, short sellers for this month are covering positions and not delivering, causing the price for this month to rise. Forward contracts are also doing well. The closing prices for all months in the morning session are up 0.20, 0.30, or 0.40 yuan respectively. Sales included 9,400 bales from Yuda, 1,100 bales from Zhenda, 2,900 bales from Taixing, 2,500 bales from Renfeng, 6,100 bales from Runkang, 1,600 bales from Changfeng, 2,100 bales from Dachang, 1,700 bales from Yuanxingchang, 2,400 bales from Juxing, 1,300 bales from Ruid , and 4,200 bales from Changhe. Purchases included 2,800 bales from Jifeng, 8,300 bales from Dafeng, 3,100 bales from Hexing, 2,800 bales from Wangtaixing, 2,200 bales from Minghua, 2,000 bales from Changyu, 2,100 bales from Renfeng, 2,500 bales from Tonghe, 2,000 bales from Shengyuan, 1,100 bales from Gengfeng, and 1,400 bales from Shenji. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Slight Activity in Coarse and Fine Cotton</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is normal. Factories are not operating at full capacity. The sources include 1,800 bales from Yao Hua and 1,200 bales of Tongzhou cotton.</p>
<h3>Strength of American Cotton Evident: Despite Large Sales, Market Prices Still Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's opening of American cotton showed the strength of American cotton. Due to favorable news from Liverpool, international markets are strong. Domestic and foreign traders are buying, with prices for various months up 3 to 9 points. Later, due to profit-taking by long positions, Wall Street sold 30,000 bales of March and May contracts, causing prices to fall slightly. Half of these sales were on behalf of factories, but all were absorbed by traders. The overall trend is firm. Foreign merchants are buying distant months. Near months are softer due to large price differences. Lower-grade loan cotton may be sold. There is a lack of new entrants. The cloth market is more active. Before the close, it was reported that German and American merchants were making progress, and the public was buying, causing market prices to rise. Spot prices are up 12 points, and futures prices are up 12 to 19 points. Spot English cotton is up 1 point, and futures are up 2 to 3 points. Indian cotton exporters and futures traders are inclined to buy due to rising Japanese yarn prices. Calcutta is up or down 0.25 rupees, Oomra is up 1.25 to 1.50 rupees, and Broach is up 1 rupee. Original telegram recorded (dated 23rd).</p>
<p>Also, according to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 24th is Broach at 224.5 rupees, Oomra at 204.75 rupees, and Bengal at 171.25 rupees, all up 0.75 rupees.</p>
<h3>Grain: Barley Prices Rebound; Outside Investors Absorb Flour in Large Quantities; Market Prices Also Rebound by 6 to 7 Points Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, prices for various months showed signs of sharp increases. Barley prices in Chicago rebounded by 2 to 5 points, Canada rose by 4 to 5 points, and Liverpool rose by 1 pence. At the opening, this month's contract, being the last month of trading, saw selling pressure and lacked strong buying, so the trend was relatively flat. January, being the end of the lunar year, saw quieter buying, and the price increases were not very rapid. From February onwards, due to renewed strong buying from outside investors, prices rose by 3 to 6 points immediately at the opening. Trading remained active thereafter, and prices fluctuated. In the afternoon session, this month's contract opened quietly, but then continued to rise by 2 to 3 points due to customer activity. From February onwards, prices continued to rise sharply due to large purchases from outside investors, with April reaching 4.30 yuan and 2.5 cents. Later, profit-taking by traders caused prices to soften slightly. This situation is purely driven by barley prices, so prices rise or fall accordingly. The domestic market has lost its stability, it is said.</p>
<h3>Forward Wheat Also Rises Strongly, Up More Than 10 Points; Spot Trading Has Not Started</h3>
<p>Yesterday's forward wheat market saw strong price increases for all months in the morning session due to rebounding barley prices and continued positive sentiment. However, the price for this month was relatively stable as factories had stopped buying spot wheat. Forward contracts, on the other hand, rebounded strongly, with prices immediately rising by 8 to 10 points despite sparse trading, due to the sharp price falls of the previous day and the rebound in barley prices. In the afternoon session, trading became more active, and prices continued to stabilize, up 1 to 4 points from the morning. Spot wheat trading has still not formally started. Factories are only offering 6.55 yuan per bushel for goods from Jiangbei, while customers are holding out for 6.60 yuan, resulting in a difference of 5 points and no transactions.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Conditions Slightly More Stable</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, shipments from various sources totaled over 100 vessels, carrying a total of 22,450 bushels of grain. Among them, thin indica rice accounted for over 40 vessels. Sales in this district were somewhat active due to the Yunnan Uprising commemoration. While wholesale trading was not brisk, the situation seemed better than before, with over 5,000 bags of thin indica rice sold. As a result, market conditions stabilized. Thick and thin japonica rice prices remained unchanged, as did Du Yang tip rice. Only Yin Yuan rice was oversupplied, resulting in a price drop of a few cents.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, 34 or 35 vessels arrived from various locations along the river. Sales of various grains in the market remained flat. However, holders of white japonica rice took advantage of the situation to sell small quantities. The morning market was quiet, but the afternoon market weakened by a few points. Early shipments were 5 to 6 points higher. Thin indica rice prices weakened again. White Yuan rice was down about 10 cents. Yangbu Du tip rice prices were flat to weak, while Ke tip rice prices held steady. Prices for other grains remained largely unchanged.</p>
<p>Today is the Yunnan Uprising Commemoration Day. All trading markets for rice, miscellaneous grains, flour, cotton yarn, bullion, foreign exchange, and public bonds in both the North and South are closed for the day. There will be no market reports tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Passenger Indica Rice Oversupplied, Market Prices Fall Again by 3 to 10 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, arrivals of passenger indica rice remained high, but sales were slow. Market prices continued to weaken, falling by another 3 to 10 cents compared to the previous session. This was mainly due to the halt in passenger traffic and weak local sales. Furthermore, merchants and wholesalers were keen to sell, and Cantonese merchants had already stopped buying rice directly from Hunan Province. As Hunan rice production prices fell, supplies were bound to increase, leading to further weakness in sentiment. The overall market opened with 190 bags of Jiangxi rice, 934 bags of Hunan rice, and 1,500 bags of Han rough rice. Except for 350 bags of Xiang Jing rice, which were purchased for inland consumption, the rest was handled by this firm, it is said.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Experiences Wild Fluctuations, Plunging 1.80 to 1.90 Yuan from Its Peak</h3>
<p>Soybean oil prices, after rising sharply in Dalian, created an extraordinary situation. Due to a correction in Dalian, sentiment softened, and the market has been in a state of suspension for a week. Only yesterday did Dalian report a slight increase, causing prices to fall. Total trading volume included 150 lots of factory oil, 200 lots of Niuzhuang oil, 200 lots of Dalian oil, and 150 lots of Qishan oil. Prices have fallen by 1.80 to 1.90 yuan from their previous peak. Such wild fluctuations are rare in the spot market.</p>
<h3>Securities: Last Day of the Month, Public Bonds Experience a Short Squeeze; Prices Down 60 to 70 Cents for This Month, Forward Contracts Only Down About 10 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market at the Chinese Securities Exchange was the last day for December futures. The trend was pessimistic due to the uncertain political situation, and the short squeeze was very strong. Dealers, seeing the increasingly weak and chaotic situation, were wary, and selling and switching positions were very active. Market prices continued to fall under the stagnant surface. In the morning session, the market was quite uncertain. Major dealers such as Nos. 10, 45, etc., were mostly selling, and switching positions were very active. Nos. 51 and 11 bought a lot. Market prices fell by 10 to 45 cents. Class B and A forward contracts and Class D contracts for this month were up 5 cents. Secondary dealers were still busy switching positions, but Nos. 43 and 45 were gradually selling, and No. 50 was buying a lot. Market prices, except for Class A for this month and Class E for next month, which fell by 20 to 30 cents, were all up 5 to 35 cents. In the afternoon session, the market remained sluggish. No. 16 continued to sell or switch positions aggressively. Class C and E contracts for this month rose by 5 cents, while Class D and A contracts all fell by 10 to 45 cents. Selling pressure intensified at the close. Nos. 47, 5, 10, etc., were still selling aggressively, and retail investors were also switching positions. The short squeeze was quite intense, and prices all fell by 5 to 30 cents. Overall, prices fell by 10 to 70 cents across the board. Class B for next month was up 10 cents. The total trading volume was 12.87 million yuan. A table comparing the price increases and decreases, highs and lows is listed below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Finance: Before the Customs Closure, Bullion Prices Rise by 1.20 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sentiment in the gold market was better, and there was considerable buying to support prices. Sellers remained cautious, so while prices rose, trading was not very active. Early in the morning, overseas silver markets in England and America were both down. It was said that after the market closed, India would follow up and add 1.25 to the listed price, and sellers were holding back. The silver market was down 1.25. Forward silver prices in Monte Carlo were down 5 to 9.5 cents. Exchange rates fell slightly. Spot gold in London fell by 1 pence. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates showed England and America unchanged. The customs gold unit fell by 2 cents. The listed price for standard bullion fell to 1150.70 yuan. There was a lack of formal trading in the over-the-counter market. Later, with sales by German firms, the market opened slightly lower. After the opening, prices were relatively stable. Then, due to large purchases by major dealers, although the amount was small, there were not many sellers either. The HSBC's listed exchange rates showed England and America unchanged, with slight gains. Later, although the silver equalization tax fell by 2 cents, buyers continued to pour in. Lacking counterparties, prices once approached the 60 yuan mark. Then, sellers began to become active, and prices fell quickly. However, there was still support at lower levels, and the market remained stable at noon. In the afternoon session, the market was relatively stable. Later, due to a lack of supply, buyers, though not numerous, were more eager, so prices gradually rose. However, buying interest waned after the rise, and the market fluctuated.</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 1157.90 yuan, down 10 cents from the previous close. German merchants sold bars, falling back to 7.80 yuan. Fu, Yu, Yong, Ding, Kang, and Tong Taichang all bought. The HSBC's listed exchange rates showed England and America unchanged, gradually rising to 8.40 yuan. Later, although the silver equalization tax fell by 2 cents, Yuan Mao and Yong Li bought, pushing prices back up to 9.70 yuan. Retail investors and Shengyuan, Yongfu, Xingyong, Qiafeng, and Yongjingfu sold, bringing prices down to 8 yuan. Dingkang, Hengchang, Yongda, and Decheng took advantage of the lower prices to buy bars. The noon close was 1158.50 yuan.</p>
<p>The opening price in the afternoon session was 1158.30 yuan. Jingfu, Dingkang, Shenda, Yongda, Decheng, Qiafeng, and Yongda came in to buy, pushing prices up to 9.40 yuan. Yuanheng and Fuxingyong sold, pushing prices back down to 8.90 yuan. Chunyuanyong and others replenished slightly. The closing price was 1159.20 yuan.</p>
<p>The final price, based on the Central Bank's listed standard bullion price of 1150.70 yuan, was 8 yuan higher than the closing price. January was registered at 1157 yuan, and February at 1159 yuan. The replenishment price for the morning session was 1156 yuan. The spot gold price was 10 yuan higher, at 1168 yuan. The spot market was slightly weak. Refined gold was 14 yuan higher, and about 100 taels were traded between gold shops. The buying price was 19 yuan higher, and Tianjin goods were 19 yuan higher, but there were no transactions. In the switching market, Chunyuanyong sold 70 bars, and Decheng sold 35 bars, at 2.10 yuan. Yuanmaoyong sold 84 bars at 2 yuan, all of which were bought by Yicheng. The situation was cheaper in the afternoon session, which was without counterparties.</p>
<p>It was clear that transactions within the market were eye-catching. Overall, Dingkang, Yuanmaoyong, Hengyu, Chunyuanyong, Hengchangyong, Shendayong, etc., were on the buying side. Fuxingyong, Yongda, Decheng, Shengyuanyong, Qiafengyong, Yuanhengyong, Hongchangyong, etc., were on the selling side. Jingfu first sold and then bought. Chunyuanyong first bought and then sold.</p>
<p>The market was stable throughout the day. The opening price in the morning was 1157.90 yuan. The highest price was 1159.70 yuan, and the lowest price was 1157.80 yuan. The final price was 1159.20 yuan, with a range of 1.90 yuan. The result was a rebound of 1.20 yuan compared to the previous close. There were 2,527 January bar contracts, with 9 long positions and 10 short positions. There were 7,427 January/February contracts, with 34 long positions and 18 short positions. The total trading volume was 581 bars in the morning session and 84 bars in the afternoon session.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange: Japanese Bank Sells Shanghai Exchange, British and American Companies Aggressively Close Shilling Positions; Interbank Trading Remains Calm</h3>
<p>The exchange market saw some support for the Shanghai Exchange yesterday, and the result was continued stability. Early in the morning, overseas telegrams reported that London rates were down by 3.75 points for both near and far months. It was said that after the market closed, India would cover positions, adding 1.25 to the listed price, and sellers were holding back. The silver market was down 1.25. Forward silver prices in Monte Carlo were down 0.5 and 5.5 cents. Spot gold in London was down 1 pence. Sterling against US dollar was down 1.15, and Sterling against French franc was unchanged. US dollar against Sterling and US dollar against French franc were both down 0.0625. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates showed the Fire US dollar unchanged. The customs gold unit fell by 2 cents. The exchange market opened with near-term selling prices of 1 shilling, 2 pence, 4.0625 and 4.375 against each other, and US dollar at 29.53125, unchanged from the previous close for both near and far months. Banks were still buying after the opening, so while Chinese merchants were selling, the HSBC's listed exchange rates showed the Fire US dollar unchanged, and the market remained stable. Later, although the silver equalization tax fell by 2 cents, the Japanese bank slightly sold Shanghai exchange and the Dongjin Bank also sold slightly. The situation was relatively weak. However, because British and American tobacco companies aggressively closed shilling positions, the market recovered at noon. In the afternoon session, banks continued to buy far-term US dollars, with occasional trades between them. The process was difficult to change quickly. Although the Japanese bank was selling Shanghai Exchange, Chinese merchants were still buying, and the market stabilized in the end. The closing selling prices for near-term were 1 shilling, 2 pence, 4.0625 and 4.375 against each other, and US dollar at 29.53125, unchanged from the previous close. Chinese merchants slightly sold US dollars, and the Japanese bank sold Shanghai Exchange. A record of the day's transactions is listed below:</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Market Strong; Factory Merchants and Silk Merchants Hold Prices More Firmly</h3>
<p>This week, the overseas silk market has gradually rebounded, and it was even stronger yesterday. New York's Japanese silk was at 83.75 cents, and Shanghai silk was at 78 cents, both up 5 cents. Guangdong silk was up 4 cents. The exchange's near-term contracts were up 2 cents, and far-term contracts were up 3 cents. Jicang spot prices were up 15 yuan, and futures prices were up 24 yuan. The market atmosphere was instantly prosperous. Only Lyons silk prices remained stubbornly unchanged. In the local silk market, firms such as Jardine had sales yesterday, but because Christmas was near, and domestic silk merchants held prices more firmly, sales were not very smooth. Sales by factories included White Factory with a uniformity of 85 at 900 yuan, a uniformity of 78 for coarse silk at 755 yuan, and Jin Ai Ying grade at 785 yuan, all of which were considered firm prices. Total sales, both domestic and foreign, were 120 bales. Western merchants are closed today, and there will also be no market on the 26th. The silk market will depend on the situation in the next adjustment.</p>
<h3>The Downward Trend in Piece Goods and Cotton Cloth Has Gradually Subsided; Japanese Factories Refuse to Open Forward Contracts</h3>
<p>The cloth market showed a slight turnaround yesterday, due to the sharp rise in the Osaka yarn and cloth market. Local Japanese yarn factories were also watching with interest, refusing to open forward contracts for brocade cloth. Retailers in the cloth industry, facing a glut of spot goods, were also eager to sell. However, some who held large quantities had changed their strategy and slightly held up prices. Therefore, the downward trend in yesterday's market had gradually subsided. However, differing opinions led to extreme chaos in the market, with prices 5 cents per piece higher than the previous session. A large number of cheap goods previously contracted by the Guanggang from the Bengchang fine twill were shipped from various Japanese factories. Because the market in Guangdong was not good, many were resold in Shanghai to other gangs, with dyeing factories absorbing more. Prices were down about 10 cents per piece. Coarse cloth, coarse twill, dyed goods, and printed goods prices were all stable. Actual sales remained slow. Only sporadic transactions were made along the various routes. The dispatch of confirmed orders was as busy as usual. With the end of the year approaching, factories were eager to close out confirmed orders. Yesterday, dyeing factories absorbed fine cloth and fine twill from the Huai Dong series, such as the Dragon Head and Five-Width Yang He brands, as well as fine twill from various Bengchang brands. The Shugang bought over 100 cases of undyed and gray fine twill, it is said.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: New Qing Cakes Prices Turn Upward</h3>
<p>The arrival of new Qing cakes has been scarce recently, and market sentiment has tightened. It was heard yesterday that Taier goods opened at 6.12 yuan, up 30 to 40 cents from before. Current sales in the inland areas of Water Street and the Wintai gang are still active. Higher quality goods are sold at 6.60 yuan to 6.73 yuan. Discounts may apply.</p>
<h3>Rain</h3>
<p>— Zhang Chunqiao</p>
<p>The rain is falling a little slower now, but the wind has picked up. The raindrops, panicked and uneasy, huddle against the windowpane, as if by doing so, the wind wouldn't be able to catch them. Though there aren't many raindrops, they make quite a noise.</p>
<p>I'm alone in my room, writing this letter to you with a sense of loneliness, no, almost a pang of sadness.</p>
<p>Sitting here in my chair, holding my pen, I don't know what to tell you first.</p>
<p>The window faces north, and it's always dark here. No sunlight penetrates the gloom, and a damp smell wafts from the corners of the room, making the air so heavy it feels like it can't circulate. I don't dare stay here too long. I'm always running around, hoping to bask in the sun a little more. I'd love to go to the nearby park, sit on the grass, and read a book. That would be so wonderful for my weak body. But, as you know, those books have educated us, and they don't allow someone like you or me to rest for even a moment, all for the sake of the sunshine that will forever illuminate our future.</p>
<p>These past few days, I really haven't been able to keep it up. My legs can't carry me very far before they feel like they're being dragged by someone. Add to that the hardships life has thrown my way. They advised me to rest for a bit, and during these few days of leisure, write something to earn some money to sustain me next month. I haven't been able to do it. I don't want to write anything frivolous, but meaningful works can't be published. So I've been spending all my time reading books I usually don't have time to read.</p>
<p>But the news in the papers has been disturbing me, making it impossible to concentrate.</p>
<p>Tonight, the rain started to fall. It's deathly dark in this room. It's as if all the light in the world has vanished. The thick, damp smell crowds around me, as if trying to suffocate me.</p>
<p>I want to go outside. My leather shoes are long since broken. How can I withstand the icy water and mud that seep into my shoes from the asphalt and dirt roads on a cold day like this? Besides, where would I go?</p>
<p>Just then, the rain began to howl wildly again, mixing with the wind and violently assaulting the earth. It's rare to encounter rain like this in early winter. It's as if it wants to destroy the world, no, to wash away all the filth, even the depression in my heart.</p>
<p>I am surrounded by a magnificent symphony.</p>
<p>I can't hear any other sounds.</p>
<p>My entire attention is captured by the storm.</p>
<p>I don't know when the door opened.</p>
<p>"Mr. Peng!"</p>
<p>The person calling me was a blurry figure. Her voice was raised, as if she had run a long way, and her throat was blocked by something, making her voice a little hoarse and trembling. It sounded familiar, yet I couldn't remember whose voice it was.</p>
<p>I flipped the light switch.</p>
<p>It was Sha?</p>
<p>She was wearing her old, dark blue gown, which had turned black from the rain. Water droplets sparkled as they slid down her face, and her hair was plastered to her head. A heavy strand hung limply on her cheek, beside her left ear. Her eyes, shining with a fire-like heat, stared at me, and when I looked at her in astonishment, she smiled!</p>
<p>"The rain is so heavy, you..."</p>
<p>"Is it strange?"</p>
<p>As she spoke, she took off her coat. I took my own worn-out cotton gown from my trunk to give to her, but she waved it away. She lay down on my bed, pulled the quilt over herself.</p>
<p>I pulled the chair closer to her.</p>
<p>She lay on her side, her hands on the quilt, her face exposed, her wet hair spread across the pillow. She looked very tired, resting.</p>
<p>I was surprised that she knew I lived here, and that she had run out in such a storm, wearing such thin clothes.</p>
<p>I had met her at a school. During the first class, I realised she was a talented person. Her abundant talent was still a virgin land, just waiting to be cultivated. Her academic results were astonishing. I simply couldn't believe that she had never studied before, or that she hadn't known how to speak Mandarin. In a very short period, she was already able to write fluent, excellent essays and speak accurate Mandarin.</p>
<p>But that was four months ago. I hadn't seen her since she graduated from the school. I had only heard from others that she was teaching, and doing very well. I had also heard that she wanted to talk to me to resolve some questions she had.</p>
<p>But we had never met.</p>
<p>How could I not be surprised by her sudden arrival today?</p>
<p>I looked at her. Her eyes were fixed on the ceiling, silent, as if she were recalling a story or a romantic dream.</p>
<p>"Where did you come from?"</p>
<p>"I was just about to tell you." She paused for a moment. "Haven't you seen the news in the papers? Things are very tense outside!"</p>
<p>Excitement shone on her face. She seemed to be forcing her voice down, but it was still very loud. The howling of the wind and rain poured in from outside, as if trying to drown it out.</p>
<p>"Could you close the window? The wind is too strong..."</p>
<p>"Of course, tell me,"</p>
<p>I turned and closed the window, and the room became quiet. All that could be heard was the howling of the wind and rain outside.</p>
<p>I looked at her excited face, remaining silent.</p>
<p>"How did you think to come here?"</p>
<p>"I had nowhere else to go, then I remembered you."</p>
<p>"Because you're our teacher! We often talk about you, and we often think of you when something happens. We always hope to get your opinion. These days, you haven't been coming, and we think of you even more often—but, are you feeling better?"</p>
<p>Her tone was steady and clear. Her innocent eyes smiled. She only fell silent after I nodded at her reassuringly.</p>
<p>I looked out the window. The lamplight shone out, clearly dividing the raindrops, like countless cotton threads, shredded by the wind, falling to the ground, disappearing.</p>
<p>I still didn't have a cotton coat, or any preparations for winter. But her enthusiasm, my anxieties were all melted by that heat. My health seemed to have been restored as well.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I'll get back to everything.</p>
<h3>晨</h3>
<p>— Gao Erji (Gorky) 作, Ren Jun 譯</p>
<p>The most interesting thing in the world is to see how a day is born.</p>
<p>The first light of the sun shines brightly in the sky, the darkness of night quietly hiding into the valleys and cracks in the rocks, hiding in the leaves of the trees and covered with morning dew, just like in the lace-knitting grass. At this time, the tops of the mountains smile kindly, as if saying to the gentle night shadows: "Don't be afraid—this is the sun!"</p>
<p>The waves of the sea raise their white heads, like the beautiful women of the court, bowing to the sun as if to their king, singing:</p>
<p>"Master of the world, we joyfully welcome you!"</p>
<p>The kind sun smiles. These waves have been playing and rolling all night; now their hair is disheveled, their green clothes are wrinkled, and the velvet skirts are tangled.</p>
<p>"Good day!" says the sun, rising above the sea. "Good day, beautiful gentlemen! But—enough is enough, give me some peace! If you continue to jump so high, won't the children be unable to bathe? Shouldn't we make everything on earth comfortable?"</p>
<p>Green lizards jump out of the cracks in the rocks, blinking their sleepy eyes, talking to each other.</p>
<p>"It will be hot today!"</p>
<p>On hot days, flies will fly around in depression, and it will be easy for lizards to catch them to eat. Devouring delicious flies is—the most delightful thing! It turns out that lizards are—very particular about what they eat and drink!</p>
<p>Flowers, wet with dew, sway each other in a playful manner, as if teasingly saying:</p>
<p>"Sir, please describe how beautiful we are when we are decorated with dewdrops in the early morning! Please look at us and describe the little portraits of various flowers in words, please try it! It's a very easy thing—we are such simple things..."</p>
<p>These little mischievous devils! They know perfectly well that people cannot describe their adorable beauty in words—they are laughing!</p>
<p>I respectfully take off my hat and say to the flowers: "Your sincerity is truly undeserved. Thank you for your kindness—but I don't have time at the moment, maybe later..."</p>
<p>When the flowers stretch their hands and feet towards the sun, as if proudly smiling, the sun's rays shine on the dewdrops, carving diamond-like brilliance on the petals and green leaves.</p>
<p>In the meantime, on the flowers, there is already a large group, a large group of yellow bees, as if greedily sucking on sweet honey. Moreover, their low and rough singing is still flowing in the warm air:</p>
<p>Celebrating the sun, the source of happy life,</p>
<p>Celebrating the merit of beautifying the earth.</p>
<p>The red-breasted robin has woken up. Standing on its slender feet, swaying its body, it also sings its own quiet, joyful song. — Birds know better than people how realistic it is to live on earth. Robins are always the first to greet the sun. And because the feathers on this little bird's small chest are still dyed by the morning light, in distant and cold Russia, this bird is even called "Morning Star." In the bushes, that cheerful, gray-green bird is jumping around. This bird is very much like the children on the street—extremely irritable, and never tired no matter how much you call.</p>
<p>Swallows fly as lightly as black arrows, chasing small insects, calling out happily, blissfully—having light wings is delightful.</p>
<p>The branches of the umbrella pine are trembling—the umbrella pine is like a large wine glass; the sunlight is like golden wine overflowing.</p>
<p>At this moment, people have also woken up. Their entire lives are—hard work; their lives are all about decorating and enriching this earth—but, from birth to death, they themselves remain poor.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>If you want to know the reason, you will understand when you grow up. For now—just love the sun, the source of all joy and strength. And, just as the sun treats everyone equally, try to be kind and cheerful as much as possible.</p>
<p>People have woken up. Then they go out to farm, go out to work—the sun looks at them and smiles. Humankind has done so many good things on earth: it knows better than anyone else. The sun has witnessed that the earth was once a desert; now, the earth has been completely covered by the great work of humankind—our fathers, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers, by important things that children cannot understand. They have also created various toys and various pleasant things on earth—among them, especially things like movies.</p>
<p>Ah, our ancestors, they worked hard. Therefore, we should cherish and respect the great work they have done that is everywhere around us.</p>
<p>Young people, you might as well try to think about this matter—narrating the chapters of how humankind works on earth is—the most interesting story in the world...</p>
<p>On the wild fence, roses are scarlet, and her flowers are blooming everywhere, while ordinary flowers have withered; but they are still gazing at the blue sky, gazing at the golden sun. The velvety petals, swaying, emit a sweet fragrance, in the fragrant, green, warm atmosphere, gently drifting soft songs:</p>
<p>Even if withered</p>
<p>Beautiful is still—beautiful</p>
<p>Even if dead</p>
<p>Lovely is still—lovely...</p>
<p>Another day has arrived.</p>
<p>Good day, young people! May you have many good days in your life!</p>
<p>As I write this, I feel lonely.</p>
<p>The child of the past is now forty years old, but has not done any work.—He feels a bit lonely.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on My Fourth Sister's Marriage</h3>
<p>— Chen Yi</p>
<p>Yesterday, I received a letter from my father saying that my fourth sister will get married on the third day of the tenth month. After reading this news, besides sighing that as a son, I cannot share a little of my old father's burden, I sat quietly for a while before exhaling a breath.</p>
<p>"Fourth sister! Another victim."</p>
<p>Fourth sister also has dizzy spells. When a dizzy spell comes on, she doesn't know anything. However, because my father is constantly running around outside to support the family, and my mother has a weak body, and the two older sisters have already married out, and the younger sister is an ignorant seven-year-old child, all the affairs of the family fall on fourth sister's shoulders. She manages the oil, salt, firewood, and rice, she manages the family's laundry, and also manages receiving guests. When I went home last year, I had to ask her for a thread. My mother often said that my younger sister is young, and I haven't taken a wife yet. What will happen when fourth sister gets married one day? So fourth sister's in-laws have come several times to ask for her birth date, but my mother has insisted on not giving it, for this very reason.</p>
<p>But as the country people often say, "Girls are outsiders." Daughters will eventually marry when they grow up. After reading my father's letter, I should be happy, I should congratulate my sister, but I am indeed extremely uneasy. I thought of my two married sisters.</p>
<p>In our hometown, such a remote mountainous area, regarded by others as an uncivilized place, it is common for daughters to be uneducated. My family is not a special class, so my sisters certainly didn't go to school. They themselves didn't have the freedom to choose their own marriages, and their parents were limited by the era they lived in, so they could do nothing about arranging their children's marriages. Although this arrangement was done with careful selection, because it was an arrangement after all, the result would not be good.</p>
<p>The older sister married a farmer's son. The brother-in-law is said to have studied for a few days, but he is unwilling to improve himself, preferring to do something for the community. My sister is a very strong-willed person. Seeing that her brother could run to Beijing and Shanghai, she thought her husband could do the same. But assuming her husband really did that one day, and found a woman outside and abandoned her, this, she never thought of.</p>
<p>On the first night of her marriage, she was ravaged like an animal, unable to resist. Etiquette taught her that this was human relations and should be endured. Getting pregnant, having children, the in-laws were afraid of spending money on a wet nurse, so on the first day after giving birth, they squeezed her milk. According to physiological knowledge, milk comes on the third day for a new mother. Eventually, she squeezed out a milk sore, which didn't heal for half a year.</p>
<p>No one cared about her sore. She came home to get medical treatment. When I saw my mother pulling out the pus, a shadow immediately appeared before my eyes, and I couldn't help but shudder. I almost shouted.</p>
<p>My mother bent over, I held the lamp, my sister sat on the chair. When my mother's hand touched the sore, my sister screamed miserably. This miserable scream particularly struck my heart, like a needle pricking it. The country doctors were unbelievably ignorant. They put a bundle of grass of unknown name on the stove to bake, and didn't even apply it to the sore, saying it could cure the disease. Only heaven knew if this was true. Trying to buy some of the most common Western medicine was like looking for a needle in a haystack. Watching my sister get thinner day by day, and the sore never closing, my mother was so anxious that she couldn't eat.</p>
<p>But her husband acted as if nothing had happened. It wasn't until they asked someone to buy medicine in the city and treated her according to my own little medical knowledge that she slowly improved. But half of my sister's hair had fallen out, and she was so thin she was unrecognizable. The first letter I received from my father after leaving home was about my sister's affair.</p>
<p>"Ju Nu's illness has recovered, but the family has already separated, ×× has not studied, doesn't know anything, alas! Ju Nu is also a person with a hard life."</p>
<p>What else could I say?</p>
<p>The second sister married a high school graduate. Although her husband smoked opium, gambled, and frequented prostitutes, fortunately, he was still good to my sister, but there was a reason for this: because he had a stepmother.</p>
<p>The stepmother treated my sister harshly. No matter how humble my sister was, she could never please the stepmother. Apart from getting pregnant and having children like the older sister, this sister was a bit healthier and more honest, so she could still get by. But every day, from the moment she got up in the morning, she cooked, fed the pigs, washed clothes, until she went to sleep, she could rest.</p>
<p>When I left home, my sister was living like this, and she wasn't even allowed to come to her in-law's house to see me off. In the next ten years, twenty years, until death, if society is still the same as it is today, my sister's situation probably won't change in the slightest.</p>
<p>Thinking of the experiences of these two sisters, I truly pity fourth sister, who will get married on the third day of the tenth month. As I read the letter, I thought to myself, although I have figured out the reason and deeply believe in it, I am sad.</p>
<p>Thinking of a remote countryside thousands of miles away, a house, a small room, a rough man embracing a pure woman, doing what is called human relations, my eyes turned black, and shadows appeared before my eyes, one, two, three...</p>
<h3>Farewell</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>Dusk at Lian Lake</h3>
<p>— Qian Dong</p>
<p>Alone by the white-walled inn on my journey,</p>
<p>The scenery of the fading year hastens homesickness,</p>
<p>In the cold night, no one speaks,</p>
<p>The bright moon fills the boat, the sound of wild geese.</p>
<p>Good mountains beyond the clouds seem to have an appointment,</p>
<p>Wild trees in the mist are of unknown name.</p>
<p>Tomorrow at the Magpie Bridge, it will be lively,</p>
<p>It must be that families are coming out to welcome their kin.</p>
<p>——Sa Dula: Passing Lian Lake at the End of the Year</p>
<p>The impression my hometown gave me was originally very faint; especially in recent years, no matter where I went to make a living, I always dragged a long tail behind me: my mother, sister, wife, children, my hometown followed me, I never worried about not hearing the harsh local accent of my hometown, I could always see the messy belongings of my family, my hometown and I had no more ties.</p>
<p>This year, my hometown suddenly moved to Danyang.</p>
<p>Danyang is a place praised by poets and writers of the past. Next to this ancient canal is the Jade Milk Spring of Danyang Guanyin Temple, which was rated as the fourth spring in the world by Zhang Youxin of the Tang Dynasty. There, poets often sang: "Fetching jade milk spring water is worth boiling, sitting in the moonlight talking about emptiness, wanting to be with the monks." And Lian Lake, opposite the Jade Milk Spring, is even more what they yearn for. "Faint light waves, gentle breeze," "Just when the moon is bright and the tea is ripe, listening to the lotus-picking song across the lake," these are all clear songs that sway from the poets' small boats on the lake.</p>
<p>This evening, after class, I wanted to shake off the fatigue on my body, so I went alone along the canal. The banks of the canal are no longer "rich in merchants" as Li Bai said, but everything seems to have declined. On the turbid river water, which is as muddy as mud, only a few old men are fishing; on the desolate embankments, which are covered with weeds, are scattered the grass sheds of Jiangbei people.</p>
<p>The north wind roared as if it wanted to swallow people, walking across the embankment, the wind seemed to blow even harder. Shrinking my body, I walked to the lakeside.</p>
<p>Darkness hung down like a curtain, the vast lake surface was like being covered with a layer of black veil, the gloomy waves surging, crashing against the lakeside. Looking at the sky, it was also covered with dark clouds, it was probably going to snow soon.</p>
<p>Of course, I don't have the elegance and fortune to come to this lakeside to taste tea; and I don't have the mood to listen to mountain songs across the lake. But I only hope to see the mirror-like water on the vast lake surface. However, darkness quickly hung down, and the surging waves still crashed.</p>
<p>In this broken era and at the edge of these broken years and days, at the edge of this vast dark sky and this vast dark Lian Lake, a person who never thinks of hometown now remembers that he needs a place like hometown.</p>
<p>Sa Dula, your boat passed by here, please tell me, where should I moor?</p>
<h3>Gide's "New Fruits"</h3>
<p>— Quan Lin</p>
<p>When Mephistopheles was about to tempt Faust, the Heavenly Emperor said to him:</p>
<p>"The branches and leaves are lush, even the gardener knows,</p>
<p>There will be a harvest of flowers and fruits next year."</p>
<p>But Faust never harvested his fruit after all. Mephistopheles won. Faust ended in tragedy.</p>
<p>Goethe, with great enthusiasm, pursued the resolution of real contradictions, pursued a complete personality, but after he finished writing Faust, he sighed to Eckerman: "It is beyond human power to solve the problems of the world; he can only find out where the problems begin, and stay within the limits of what he can understand. His function does not allow him to understand the activities of nature. It is futile for him to try to understand the universe with a limited perspective. The principles of man and God are two completely different things." As this great poet gradually aged, he finally felt tired.</p>
<p>Goethe's ennui was precisely the ennui of many great artists in the 19th century. With their great genius, they recognized the contradictions and ugliness of reality, but they could not find a way out to solve it. They wanted to find a fulfilling life, but they felt that they could not find it in this real world; so they hesitated, were distressed, and did not know what to do. Finally, they hid in the embrace of idealism or religion to seek comfort—this almost became a representative tone in 19th-century literature and art.</p>
<p>Now, looking at it from a historical perspective, we can understand why these great artists could not find their way out. It was not because their genius was not great enough, but because their historical era limited them. When they lived in a historical era based on individualism, and tried to find a way out for this era from an individualistic approach, as Goethe said, it was futile.</p>
<p>We should be grateful for being born in this era. We have seen not only in theory but also in practice a new future for humanity. The flowers of a new social system that have bloomed from the historical soil of individualism have answered the questions that the predecessors could not solve. A free, unoppressed society is in our prospect. From there we can find a complete personality, find humanity's true happiness. But this new era has not yet arrived—perhaps it is still quite a distance from us. This requires us to reach it with even more arduous and determined efforts. In such an arduous struggle process, we may encounter greater distress and disappointment. How will we overcome these distresses (which can be said to be the general distresses of modern youth)? Gide's "New Fruits" (Les Nouvelles Nouritures, published in 1935) gives us a clear answer.</p>
<p>With what attitude will we face this reality? The author tells us:</p>
<p>"Raise your lowered head. Raise your eyes that are looking down into the tomb, but don't raise them too high, to look at the vast sky, but look at the horizon. Comrade, boldly, renewedly, prepare to leave this place corrupted by the poisonous bacteria of corpses, and go where your steps guide you. Let your hope push you forward. Don't let yourself be pulled back by the love of the past! Move forward to the future. It is enough to seek poetry from your dreams; now you must learn to find it in reality. If it is not there, then create it yourself."</p>
<p>Yes, create it. Human beings are determined by reality, but at the same time they are also creating reality. How we will create a new reality cannot be solved in the circle of individualism. We need to have a new outlook on life:</p>
<p>"Know how to acquire that which makes lamentation useless! Do not beg from others what you cannot obtain yourself.</p>
<p>"...Build your happiness on the creation of happiness for all. Work, struggle, and do not accept things that you cannot change. You must learn to repeat this sentence: Everything depends on myself. It is cowardly for people to bow their heads to the evils caused by themselves. Don't think anymore—if you have ever thought this way—that submission is clever, otherwise, don't go to this kind of cleverness for inspiration again.</p>
<p>"Comrade, do not accept the life that others give you. Continue to pursue yourself, that which can improve life—this is our life, your life, and the life of all; not that kind of future life that people say can give us comfort in this present life, that calls us to endure misfortune. Do not accept it! When you know that it is man, not God, who should be responsible for all the evils in life, you will no longer succumb to evil.</p>
<p>"Do not make any more sacrifices to idols."</p>
<p>Building your happiness on the creation of happiness for all is the most important point. Your happiness and the happiness of all cannot be separated. People must satisfy themselves only when all can satisfy themselves. This does not depend on Faustian erudition, but on knowing "how to acquire that which makes lamentation useless"—struggle. It is people themselves, not God, who create all evils, and people should not succumb to all evils. People must have the courage to break the surface of this evil society in order to achieve their happiness. Believe in your own strength, and continue to struggle against all idols, all things that oppress humanity. Transform reality and create reality through struggle. Only at such a price can we achieve humanity's true happiness, can we obtain humanity's true liberation, can we create a complete personality, can humanity conquer nature, can we obtain the so-called "unlimited expansion of love."</p>
<p>Gide's "New Fruits" grows out of the soil of reality. It has not a trace of metaphysical odor (although this gardener was once a faithful Christian). It is a valuable treasure for young people.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement</p>
<p>Brief Notes</p>
<h3>Using Chinese Learning as the Core and Western Learning for Application</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Chinese society is a very ancient, conservative, yet contradictory society. To prove that I am not talking nonsense, let's talk about doctors.</p>
<p>Chinese medicine is said to have been invented very early. Since Shennong tasted hundreds of herbs, for thousands of years, after the experience of many famous doctors, the theory of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements and various mysterious principles have also been invented, making it difficult for the general public to fathom its profundity. In the last century, due to the opening of the sea, the Chinese people have come to know that the so-called "world" also includes countries that are not barbarian tribes besides "Hua Xia". When Chinese people suffer from diseases and feel that Hua Tuo cannot be reborn, when they have no other way, they have to ask Western doctors for advice. In fact, it is because of this need that more and more people are learning Western medicine. Now, the business of Western medicine is gradually developing, and patients' belief in them has also increased due to facts.</p>
<p>In big cities, the situation of Chinese medicine and Western medicine being on opposite sides has turned into a situation of one pressing and one retreating. The retreating side even feels a bit unsustainable, so they realize the power of some kind of weapon of the other side and try to imitate it. But unfortunately, the doctor's responsibility is to save lives, not to kill. Using Western medicine methods to resist Western medicine will not only fail to resist, but will also often put patients at risk of dying in vain. I have encountered some patients who are bound by traditional concepts, believing that for certain diseases, Chinese medicine is not good, such as surgery, which must be taught by Western medicine, but for certain internal medicine symptoms, Chinese medicine is indispensable. They generally believe in the famous saying "Chinese learning as the core, Western learning for application," and for medicine, they also believe that only a combination of Chinese and Western medicine can cure the disease. Some patients often take Chinese medicine and get Western medicine injections, thinking that this combination of Chinese and Western medicine will cure the disease faster, but there are also times when both Chinese and Western medicine are helpless.</p>
<p>On the one hand, because patients have this need, and on the other hand, to show their intelligence, some Chinese medicine doctors also administer injections themselves, such as antipyretic injections and serum injections. Some Chinese medicine doctors even bring their own medicine, so Western doctors don't have to bother anymore. However, after the injection is given, whether there is a reaction in the patient, what the degree of the reaction is, and whether there is any damage to other parts of the body, is unknown. In this situation, patients can only rely on fate.</p>
<p>Recently, there was a report that a Chinese medicine doctor was "falsely using Western medicine and Western medical equipment, which was prohibited by the former Ministry of Health. The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, in view of the fact that a few Chinese medicine doctors still abuse Western medicine and syringes to treat people, specially ordered all Chinese medicine groups to strictly abide by the prohibition and send inspectors to investigate at any time to crack down on it and value people's lives...etc." If it were not for the threat to patients' lives, the Health Bureau would not have told them to "value people's lives." My bringing this up does not mean that I am opposed to Chinese medicine. Although Chinese medicine has thousands of years of history, due to the high-speed progress of the times, it cannot reverse its fate. Today, due to the development of transportation and the prevalence of machinery, some diseases unique to metropolises cannot only not be cured by Chinese medicine, but even the causes of the diseases cannot be known. Because such disease names do not exist in ancient medical books, they can only blindly guess the "symptoms." To give an example, the causes of "cancer" have not been found by "cancer" experts in Europe, America, and Japan, so Western doctors are helpless when they encounter cancer. However, our Chinese medicine doctors are said to have a way to cure this problem, but Mr. Huang Yingbai ultimately died.</p>
<p>These words are all facts, without any emotionality or contempt for Chinese medicine. I believe that at this time, Chinese medicine should admit its own lack of methods and incompleteness of knowledge, and treat patients with the attitude of "knowing what you know, and not knowing what you don't know." Patients can believe in both Chinese and Western medicine, but do not misunderstand the saying "Chinese learning as the core, Western learning for application" and make presumptuous claims to combine the strengths of both, because medicine is not a child's play, and the truth of the world is only one after all!</p>
<h3>Plum Blossom</h3>
<p>— Meng Hua</p>
<p>It is winter. According to the seasons, it is almost the time of "Heavy Snow". But in Shanghai, in the Jiangnan region, one can only see small snowflakes mixed in the "autumn rain" like cow's hair. At this time, I often miss the north, missing the pure white snow of the north.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Early this morning, when I just woke up, the outside of the window was covered with a hazy white fog, and the sky was as gloomy as lead. I thought it was time for snow, but unexpectedly, after an hour or two, the sound of rain rang outside. Looking out the window, it was just like the weather in the late spring of the north, knowing that there was no hope of snow again. Living in this turbid city, we are too far, too far away from nature.</p>
<p>It is not because I have heavy fur coats or a warm home that I love snow. I get comfort from the snow. As soon as I see snowflakes flying in the air, I feel like I am in my hometown, and I feel satisfied. But now, it is raining outside, and I can't help but feel lonely.</p>
<p>In the rhythm of raindrops, the noise of the city is dull. Sitting in the cold room, I thought of what happened a few years ago.</p>
<p>It was on a clear morning after a heavy snowfall. When we got up and opened the window, we saw several inches of snow accumulated in front of the steps, and the roof was also covered with a white layer. So, Shu suggested to me, "Let's go to Beihai Park."</p>
<p>We walked towards Beihai Park, stepping on the snow. The white stone railings of the Jin'ao Yudong Bridge were covered with white snow, and the withered willows by the South China Sea pond were also dressed in new clothes. The frozen water surface of the Imperial River was evenly covered with a clean and soft white felt. On the snowy ground at the entrance of Beihai Park, our footprints were the first to be printed.</p>
<p>"Could it be that the plum blossoms are blooming!" Shu pointed to the trees covered with frost flowers in the distance and asked me. From where we were standing, it really looked like a plum forest full of white flowers.</p>
<p>"Really the tone of a southerner, where are there plum blossoms now? They are frost flowers!" I said.</p>
<p>We walked towards there, stepping slowly under the jade trees and jade branches. The snow under our feet made a low, crisp sound. From time to time, frost flowers and residual snow fell on our collars. We seemed to be surrounded by a misty sea of white flowers, and it seemed as if we had entered a quiet, cold fragrance.</p>
<p>Shu raised her hand and held onto a small branch. Just as she was about to break it off, she inadvertently shook off the snowflakes on the branches. What remained were the scorched yellow branches. She finally managed to break off a branch and gave it to me, saying:</p>
<p>"Beautiful. Next winter, we won't be here anymore. Maybe this is the last time, maybe after returning to the south, we will never see snow again. Let's keep this tender branch covered with frost flowers as a souvenir."</p>
<p>We looked at each other silently. I took the tender branch from her hand.</p>
<p>"You know, frost flowers are easy to disappear. They will melt in a short while."</p>
<p>She didn't answer, but looked up at me, her eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>Now, in my luggage, I still treasure the tender branch she gave me, but since that time, we have left the north together and come to this prosperous Jiangnan. Jiangnan occasionally snows, but before October, she had quietly returned to her southern home.</p>
<p>Maybe she is waiting for the plum blossoms to bloom in the south, just as I am waiting for heavy snow. The snow should fall soon, but when will we meet again?</p>
<p>The rain is falling rustlingly outside the window, and my heart is even more lonely.</p>
<h3>The Child Picking Up Trash</h3>
<p>— Lu Zhi</p>
<p>Morning. When I took the book and walked out of the alley, a child walked towards me. He was very young, no more than three feet tall, wearing a single-breasted jacket in the style of a woman. I say "woman style" because the jacket was neither long nor short, just covering his knees. He wore a pair of foot-wrapped trousers, one gray and the other black broken rubber shoes, a melon-shaped hat turned inside out, carrying a broken burlap bag, and holding a pair of iron tongs for picking up trash. This is a common sight of poor children wandering the streets. He walked too solemnly, this unusual behavior of the child caught my attention, but I didn't pay attention. When he walked to a trash can not far from me, he stopped, tiptoed, and leaned half his body to climb into the trash can. A burst of dust flew up from the mouth of the can as he searched for what he needed.</p>
<p>After a while, he struggled to stand up, obviously disappointed. He straightened his bag, took the iron tongs and was about to walk to the second trash can. At this time, he very sincerely brushed away the dust on his dirty jacket. While brushing, he walked to the second trash can and picked up trash as before. He picked up something from the second can, stood up, and brushed his clothes as before, then turned and walked into the alley... A light, natural action that moved me very much.</p>
<p>The clothes were already very dirty, and he was going to continue climbing into trash cans, continuing to soil them. But he didn't give up brushing off the dust just because of this inevitable reason. He was not upset because of the past, nor disappointed by the future. There was dust now, and he still tried his best to brush it off. From this kind of behavior, I saw the greatness of human vitality.</p>
<p>The child is still ignorant of life, maybe his action was accidental, but isn't this the case for most people? They are not upset because of their past unhappiness, nor are they disappointed by whether the future can be improved. They are still working hard on what they should do, working hard to achieve the completeness that their ability can reach, even if they have already fallen into disappointment, they are still constantly working hard, isn't this the same as the child picking up trash brushing the dust off his dirty clothes?</p>
<p>I thought of what Kouchuan Baicun said in his book "Symbols of Melancholy": "The life force that never wants to solidify or stagnate, avoids compromise and surrender, and only seeks freedom and liberation, is always burning in the depths of the heart, whether consciously or unconsciously." It is this burning flame that prevents people from falling into the abyss of despair, and enables mankind to conquer nature and build society, right?</p>
<p>This child picking up trash is still young, so the only way he can improve himself is to brush off the dust on his body. But if he can maintain this spirit and not let it solidify and stagnate in his life, then he will definitely be able to surpass his current life, this is undeniable. Therefore, I saw a terrible devil's hand grabbing him from behind, stuffing him into a trash can full of filth, begging for a living all day long, killing him alive. This devil's hand is none other than the society he lives in, our society.</p>
<p>Looking at his dark, innocent hands, I secretly blessed him, hoping that he would use these hands to brush away the devil's hand that was grabbing him, which is also what I should do.</p>
<p>The power of life is precious in human beings, but how much life force is suppressed, harmed, and eliminated?</p>
<p>I bit my lip and walked out of the alley, the child was long gone.</p>
<h3>Woodcutter's Song</h3>
<p>— Liu Wang</p>
<p>In the early morning, a thick fog was permeating the rolling hills, like a broad white gauze belt, tightly wrapping the trees on the mountains. The sun had already climbed up from behind the mountains, so magnificent and so brilliant. The golden light threads, like thousands of feathered arrows, pierced through the fog and sent out metallic laughter to the world.</p>
<p>Liga, the young and lively girl in the village, at this time shouldered a slender carrying pole, skipping and running through the winding path obscured by the fog, and headed towards the mountain. The blue and white patterned homespun headscarf fluttered in the morning breeze, brave and handsome. The carrying pole often jumped off her shoulders, so she simply held it in her hand, waving it skillfully like a Jianghu street performer.</p>
<p>Except when it rained or snowed, Liga would always run to the small mountain in front of the village early in the morning to chop firewood. When the sun was about to move directly in the middle of the sky, and the blue-gray smoke was swirling from the thatched roofs of the houses in the village, her firewood would also be piled into two large piles. Tying them up with ropes, she would carry them home.</p>
<p>Recently, she had been getting up even earlier and was even happier doing this work. It turned out that she had met Yun Ge'er from the east village the month before. The two fell in love privately and used this early time, when people didn't pay much attention, as an opportunity for their secret trysts.</p>
<p>Along a yellow sand mountain road, Liga nimbly climbed up the mountain. When she reached the mountainside, she darted into the woods, letting the emerald green pine needles conceal her. She pushed aside the thorns and stepped to the [blank] colored [blank] side. In the [blank] grass, a spring quietly flowed. It shot through the grass piles, climbed over the stone chips, making a gurgling sound. Many black lizards were crawling on the stones. Liga stretched out her bare feet, and these small animals all slid over the back of her feet and flowed down the mountain.</p>
<p>Liga reflected her face in a deeper part of the stream, checking if there was still sleep in her long eyelashes, and then scooped up a handful of spring water and smeared it on her face. She looked at the beautiful homespun headscarf, nodded, and smiled. She loved this new headscarf that she had tied on today. She thought that when Yun Ge'er saw it, he would definitely praise it endlessly.</p>
<p>Waiting and waiting, Yun Ge'er was still not seen. The thick fog on the mountain had become thin and was about to be dried up by the sun. She felt a little agitated, her heart empty. Throwing the carrying pole into the spring water, she sat down on the rock and sang her love song. The singing was clear and loud, echoing in the valley.</p>
<p>"Chopping firewood requires a hazy sky,</p>
<p>Loving a girl should be in her young years;</p>
<p>Beneath the pine forest, there is a black rock,</p>
<p>Just right for us to sleep neck to neck..."</p>
<p>Singing, Liga herself felt a little shy, humming the last sentence in a low and weak voice. A burst of irrepressible tenderness went away with the flowing spring. Her face gradually turned red, and touching her cheeks, they were burning hot. She somewhat hated Yun Ge'er, why hadn't he come yet? He should understand the preciousness of time!</p>
<p>She thought: Maybe he is sick? But it was absolutely impossible for a body as strong as a lion to get sick, so maybe he was tied up by other important things? Thinking and thinking, Liga picked up the carrying pole again and walked out of the pine forest. She stood on the mountain path looking towards the foot of the mountain, but there was no sign of Yun Ge'er. There was a person walking up, she recognized her clearly, it was Sister-in-law Xiang Sheng, Yun Ge'er's neighbor.</p>
<p>As Sister-in-law Xiang Sheng got closer, Liga could no longer restrain her boiling enthusiasm, and hurriedly asked. At this time, she had completely forgotten her shyness.</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law, have you seen Yun Ge'er?"</p>
<p>"Yun Ge'er? He went to Mount Liang Laoye to chop firewood yesterday afternoon. Someone saw him and reported it to Liang Laoye. This morning, Liang Laoye ordered three militiamen from the town's security regiment to arrest him." Sister-in-law Xiang Sheng said, while looking at the listener with concern.</p>
<p>Liga didn't even say hello to Sister-in-law Xiang Sheng and ran madly down the mountain. The carrying pole was dragged, jumping on the rugged mountain road. The blue and white homespun headscarf, like a corner of a flag, fluttered in the wind.</p>

<h3>Ao Enhong and Lu's Brothers Joint Aid to Sui Film Exhibition</h3>
<p>Recently, the Daxin Company has been constantly holding various exhibitions, but they are all more focused on calligraphy and painting. Except for the previous exhibition by the Westerner Mr. Nibbs, the photography exhibition has been deserted for a long time. Unexpectedly, at the end of this year, the young photographers Ao Enhong and the Lu Fu brothers will hold a joint aid to Sui photography exhibition on the fourth floor of Daxin Company (dates are from the 19th to the 31st of this month) to end this year's art scene. And their film exhibition is also of a patriotic nature.</p>
<p>This time, the three of them have a total of more than 230 works, of which Ao Enhong's are the most, accounting for half of the total, and Lu Yu's are the least.</p>
<p>Ao Enhong's works mainly depict life and architecture in North China.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>At this critical time in North China, looking at them increases melancholy. Ao's photography often captures the most important point with extremely simple scenes, using light strokes to create beautiful pictures. Among them, No. 2 "A Blow of Wind", and No. [blank]'s "Smoke and Rain Picture", an ancient pine standing alone complementing the vivid characters, the picture is clear and elegant, and it is also mounted into a vertical axis, antique, simply a famous painting of the Tang and Song dynasties. No. 99's "Eulogy" and No. 93 "Flying", have strong tones and unique styles. Other outstanding works include the portrait "White Clouds Like Running Water Years", which is meaningful, the still life "Little Birds on Branches Accompany Red Makeup", the life scene "Winnowing Wheat", and the architecture "White Pagoda Night".</p>
<p>Lu Fu's works are mostly satirical, with very appropriate titles, such as "The Result of Laziness" and "Face as Round as a Rich Man," etc., with a strong cartoon style. No. 154 "Moon in the East Window" has excellent lines and is full of poetry; others, such as [blank] Yu [blank] "Drinking Water and Thinking of the Source" and "Old Tree Across Autumn," are all considered masterpieces.</p>
<p>It is said that their method of aiding Sui is to donate half of the proceeds from the sale of their works to the front line. Such an act is naturally enthusiastic and commendable.</p>
<h3>"Lofty Ambition" Theme Song</h3>
<p>The Xinhua blockbuster "Lofty Ambition" is a work reflecting the "storm of the times," directed by Wu Yonggang, starring Jin Yan, Wang Renmei, Chen Juanjuan, Wang Jielong, Han Langan, and others. This film depicts the process of farmers being plundered, entirely based on a bloody record of real life. Under Mr. Wu's novel and lively treatment, it unfolds as nothing less than a shocking picture. The theme song "Pulling the Plow Song" in the play, sung by Jin Yan and Wang Renmei, is generous and passionate, full of the spirit of struggle, enough to inspire the audience's national consciousness. The lyrics are recorded below:</p>
<p>(A) Heiyo pull, (B) Heiyo pull, (A) Heiyo pull, (B) Heiyo pull, don't look back, don't look back, our hometown only has poverty and sorrow! The water has become a disaster for three thousand miles, and the county magistrate urges rent as if it were fire! Abandon home, heiyo, leave the village, heiyo, walk the world, heiyo, the vast land of the border provinces can still survive!</p>
<p>(A) Pull hard, (B) Pull hard, (A) No livestock, (B) No livestock, (A) Let’s carry the adopted son on our shoulders, (B) Let’s carry the rope on our shoulders, heiyo pull, heiyo pull, reclaim wasteland, heiyo, open up wilderness, heiyo, rely on our own hands, heiyo, walk forward with blood and sweat! (B) Heiyo pull, (A) Heiyo pull, Heiyo pull, (B) Heiyo pull, don't look back, don't look back, our hometown only has poverty and sorrow, (A) Heiyo pull, (B) Heiyo pull, (All) Pull, pull!</p>
<h3>Art China Recent News</h3>
<p>Art China Company's special blockbuster of this year, produced by Yan Chuntang, written by Huang Mo, and directed by Fang Peilin, "Sequel to Incarnation Girl," has been in production for half a year, exhausting all efforts, and is now announced to be completed. It is scheduled to be released publicly in Shanghai on New Year's Day, and it will surely cause a sensation among the audience, with a special grand occasion.</p>
<p>"Sequel to Incarnation Girl" stars Yuan Meiyun, along with Lu Ming, Wang Naidong, Han Langan, Guan Hongda, Qin Tong, Wang Guilin, Liang Dusheng, and others, working together with outstanding talent and skilled acting, goes without saying. The film has beautiful writing, clear light, bright sound, and magnificent scenery, which is the fact that Art China dominates the silver screen. It is a sincere contribution after Christmas, and a blockbuster worth watching.</p>
