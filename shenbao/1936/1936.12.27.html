<h3>歐洲外交的親展開</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>上週英意關於地中海的紳士協定成立以後。法意之間亦成立同樣性質的妥恊。一年來地中海上的緊張空氣。在這年殘歲暮的時候。居然顯示了逐漸的好轉這好轉。現在已產生具體的結果。卽對於西班牙內戰的不干涉問題。意國已改變態度。停止對於西國叛軍的接濟。而繼續實行積極干涉的德國。則已由英法加以共同的勸告。</p>
<p>這次英法對於西班牙不干涉問題的共同態度。其重要性不單在於應付西班牙事件的本身。而在於這兩個國家外交上的切實合作一年以來。英法對於歐洲許多重要問題的應付態度。始終是貌合神離的。如關於意阿問題。法國的態度不及英國的强硬。關於洛卡諾問題。英國態度又不如法國的關切。這種態度的不一致。實際上乃是造成一年來歐洲許多危機的原因。但是。在最近一兩月來。英國對意的談判。法國顯然是從旁助其一臂的。而對於西班牙問題的應付。法國也始終堅守與英國的共同態度。這樣的外交策略。現在已經獲得相當的成功了。所以地中海上紳士協定簽訂之後。英法對於德國干涉西國內戰的勸吿。也立卽同時發出。而這樣的共同勸吿。事實上卽等於很有力的警吿。</p>
<p>從這種形勢看來。現在法國人民陣綫政府的外交。顯然比拉伐爾時代的外交。更來得成功。自從去年德國宣佈恢復軍備到今年的進兵萊茵河。爲戰後法國外交力量最衰微的一個時期。這次法外長台爾波招德使談話。對於德國的接濟西班牙叛軍。已給與相當强硬的勸吿。這種比較有力的表示。當爲法國逐漸恢復它的原有外交地位的先聲。我們細察萊翁勃侖的外交政策。覺得他的。方針是很不錯的一方面。他以全力信賴法蘇互助協定。另一方面。他也堅持不放棄對於英國的合作。甚至與法國政策包含多少矛盾的意國。他也盡量保持其妥協的目的。此外在設法更加增强法國與小協的各國的關係之外。更盡力使近年來比較疏遠的波蘭。與法國重整舊日的友好。這樣的外交方策有一個中心目標。卽防止法國最大敵人德國的侵略。現在歐洲一般外交局勢的展開。證明萊翁勃侖這種外交上的努力。已經多少能够達到他的目標了。</p>

<h3>日本統治軍需工業　擴張民間軍需工業改善生產　各工場受軍部之指導與監督　海陸軍兵工廠工人達十萬人</h3>
<p>東京特訊、日本目前一切設施、最足爲我國國民所應注意者、卽其軍需工業之統治問題、明平度軍事預算約十四億元、較今年增加三億四千萬圓、陸軍之六年三十二億計劃、（自明年起）與海軍部少第三次補充計劃、可以得悉日本軍費膨脹之新趨勢、因此軍需工業、亦隨之擴充、日本軍需工業、國營者佔少數、多半寄托在民間工業、茲分誌如次、</p>
<p>民間工業</p>
<p>據陸軍省之調査、自昭和六年（一九三一年）至昭和十年、此五年間、支出軍需品經費總額十億六千六百萬圓、其中七億八千五百萬元、係注入民間工業者、又昭和十年海軍軍需品百分之六八係由民間工業供給、由此可知民間工業與軍需生產品之關係、軍費膨脹後、民間軍需工業有强化統治之絕對必要、如擴張民間軍需工業之能力、防制價格之提高、抑制高利貸、統治大資本工業與中小工業之聯絡、改善生產技術與設備、保護機密、及戰時勳員之迅速化種稀問題、均與統治民間軍需工業有非常之必要、日本軍部對於強化軍需工業、現正在愼重考慮中、</p>
<p>統治現況</p>
<p>日本軍需工業統治政策、早已存在、大正七年制定之軍需工業動員法係最早之統制法、此係受世界大戰之影響與蘇聯誕生兩　因素直接刺激之結果、但僅係法律之存在、施行律令與施行細則、始終未公佈、軍需工業統制法雖未實施、但事實上已有統制事實之存在、（一）石油　業法、強制石油公司有貯油之義務、以保護國內製油工業為其方針、（二）汽事事業法、以發展國產汽車爲目標、此二種法令均含有事業許可統制之意味、同時政府對於事業計劃、以强力干涉之權能、達到統制之效果、表面上　係普通經濟統制之範關、但實際上係以强化直接軍需工業爲主眼、現今提出之電力統治問題、其所以得軍部强力支持　因其間接含有軍需工業統治之意義、遞信省爲適應海軍預算膨大起見、積極統制造船業、現正起革造船事業法、共不根據法令而達到統制效能者、陸軍方面、有日本製鋼、大島制鋼·騰倉工塲·住友伸銅·日本樂器·汽車製造·南部造槍所·石川島飛行機·日本車輛·汽車工業·日立製作·國產·業·等工塲、海軍方面、有日本電池·菱電機·藤永田造船·昭和製作·石川島造船·大阪鐵工·川西航空機·日本毛織·日本火工·日本電工·帝國製麻·日本精工·幸袋工作所·愛知時計·等工塲、陸海軍雙方面者、三菱重工業·東京計器·日本光學·東京瓦斯電工·川崎造船·中島飛行機·當士電機·等工塲、各工塲受軍部之統制、有嚴守秘密之義務、關於設備能力製造品之品質、均受嚴格之干涉與監督、</p>
<p>今後傾向</p>
<p>日本陸軍兵工廠、在昭和七年有工人一萬三千、海軍兵工廠有三萬八千、現陸軍工廠之普通工與臨時工已達三萬二千人、海軍工更擴充到七萬九千、合計的十萬人、日本國營軍需工業、雖規模宏大、但仍不能完成明年軍費擴充之任務、今後將努力指導民間生產力之擴張、努力研究平時工業生產設備、如何能轉換而成戰時軍需工塲、此點與歐戰前夕之德國情形相似、此極堪注意者也、（二十日）</p>
<h3>上月東北特產　由大連輸出統計　豆油高粱減退　大豆豆餅增加</h3>

<h3>上海之電器製造業　（續）</h3>
<p>— 中國微信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概況之四十）</p>
<p>去年一年間本埠電器材料之營業情形，據本所調查綜合所得，春季銷路甚爲平淡，且以外匯逐漸放長，存貨較多之廠家甚至大吿虧蝕，如三月間上海燈泡公司之收歇，卽其影響所致。惟入秋以後頽勢逆轉，更以意阿戰爭及新貨幣制度之影響，料價大漲，存貨較多者，均能補得上半年之損失而有餘，如匯通·鴻康·協豐·天發協等家，均獲有盈餘。至過去一年間本埠燈泡一業一產銷槪况，據大美晚報記者向該業廠家調査所得，產額最多者爲亞浦爾廠，共達二百萬只，營業價値四十萬元，决爲華德廠，產量雖不及亞浦爾廠，但其所出燈泡之支數多爲高伏特，故營業額超過前者達六十萬元以上，但均較前年爲减。同時更因供過於求之關係，泡價削跌至血本以內者亦有之，按二十三年普通燈泡每百只售價三十二三元，去年竟一度跌至十元左右。又能申報所載稍有上下，卽去年本埠各燈泡廠共產燈泡一千六百餘萬只，亞浦爾佔三分之一，卽佔五百餘萬只，較前說多三百餘萬只，售價最高者普通泡每百只二十二元、最低者八元、兩者均足供參考、</p>

<p>局長致詞　潘局長公展演說云、各位同志、今天是我們全國最歡喜的一天、我們的領袖五十生辰上海各學校靑年學生慶祝領袖時、曾經說過我們革命領袖的工作、在最近期內有偉大的貢默、本月十二日在西安被張學良刦持我們全國聽到這個消息我們起來就一致討逆、我們相信一定可以安然出險、繼續行使職權、我們現在得到領袖、安然回京、我們十幾天內的痛恨、現在回來之後之歡騰、充分表示擁護領袖之熱烈、我們自這一次、西安事變、及我們領袖之能回來、其間有三種力量、（一）是領袖偉大崇高的人格感化的力量、我們民族復興從此次事變完全表露出來、今天慶祝非但慶祝領袖回來、並祝民族復興、我們要認識、我們領袖到西安、明知是危險、然而竟不避危險而去、這就可知我們領袖的魄力、張學良之行爲、全國多已知道他的陰謀、都勸領袖不要去、我們領袖乃不怕死、他要用偉大的人格去感動不能感動的人、所以他有西安之行、不料狼子野心的張學良非但不能感動、而且刦持、我們的領袖在圍困之中、第一件事、使張學良感動的卽領袖的日記、同時領袖在張學良屢决見他的時候、對他說、你呌我委員長、卽是我的部下、應送我回京、你要挾我、卽是叛逆可以立刻殺我、這也是領袖偉大之處、最後領袖寫信給何部長停止轟炸、不爲了私人之故而犧牲民衆、並且此次一到洛陽、卽下令停止軍事行動、此種偉大崇高的人格、雖然不能完全感動張學良、然而至少可使其認識、領袖人格之偉大、（二）是全國民意團結的力量、道决的事件雖然不幸、然而得到一個測騐、卽除了極少數的漢奸共產黨之外、全國四萬萬五千萬人民、都一致的擁護領袖、聲討叛逆、這一種空前偉大的測騐、卽證明了中國的力量、這一種力量足以蛾倒任何鉅大的變亂、何况一個張學良、此次事變、世界各國都一致注意、看中國如何應付此次事變而斷定中華民族之造吾能復興、我們且看昨夜一種熱烈歡騰的情形、和前幾天的痛憤表示、簡直無老無幼、無男無女不論何地、不論何階級都是一致的、這一種團結的偉大的力量、足以證明中國已到了怒吼的時候、民族復興一定會成功的、（三）是政府健全組織的力量、人家說我們無組織、但從此次測騐中證明、我們的政府是有組織的、不因爲一個人失了自由而搖動、所以領袖被刦持之後、中央政府第一步卽褫職嚴辦、第二步卽卜令討伐、步驟分明、系統不亂、卽可知我們的政府是絕對有健全的組織、張學良刦持領袖、完全一種要挾、以爲我們必定要投鼠忌器、然而我們的政府決定的辦法、乃投鼠不忌器、此種政府有健全組織的力量表示出來、就可以克服了叛逆、總之此次事變的測騐就證明了中國有偉大人格的領袖、有團結一致的民衆、有組織健全的政府、道三種力量混合爲一、卽是一個現代國家、我們二具備了此種條件、故中國已是一個現代的國家、所以我們今天慶祝領袖脫險、同時也是慶祝我們的民族已走上復興之大　、</p>

<p>昨日客秈到　兩旺、市面又轉活潑氣象、客貨汕頭帮暢辦外、外經停辦之廣州帮亦有早糙與碎米問津、粵帮　向湘省直接辦裝後、滬上動辦立見沉寂、近以湘省轉運與手續均極麻煩、故略有在市點綴　、本街進胃亦活、且時局安定、人心向上、水貨立見加旺、行情亦復回好　角矣、全日　出江西米五千二百包、湘米一千五百包、沙漢糙米一千包、溫甬各米一千七百五十包、</p>
<h3>油餅漲風復熾</h3>
<p>昨日豆油豆餅、因大連市況續升、復行上騰、市氣非常緊張、豆餅有行家問津、以套　交易所盈利、故買氣見盛、行情（四牌廠餅）自一元九角二分、立卽步漲至一元九角五分、統計成交九千餘片、豆油刻下各路內地備冬、銷塲已減少、本街槽坊購存、為時尙早、所以交易未見興奮、結果成交各油六百餘件、行情漲六七角不等、</p>
<h3>證券　債市頓形蓬勃　市場買氣異常熱烈　各債一致漲起元餘</h3>
<p>昨日華商證券交易所、公債市場祇做一月份期貨交易、市況因蔣委員長安然出險，時局之暗淡、頓見明朗、市場人氣、驟呈蓬勃氣象、大戶吸收愈為濃厚、檯面堅昂狀態、已超越西安事變　之挺秀、市價亦因人心活躍、惟環境變化、已入另一階段、前途將續多激烈之升降也、昨日經過、因晨初報載有蔣院長脫險之佳音、人心極為振奮、上午開盤、十一·五十四號等羣起買進、頗見踴躍惟散戶則已漸多賣出作為了結、市價一致猛騰一元零五分至一元四角半、次盤四十七號及四十三號等　賣甚湧、散戶亦續有出售、戊丁丙種回跌五分至一角半、惟五十四·十一號仍　　　　返京　訊、買　　　　　五·十一號等續見買進、戊乙等均好五　至二角、甲種則跌　五分、收盤四十七·四十三號復　大　售出統戊乙等回降一角至三角、十一十號等買　仍湧、甲種又好起五分、全日結果一律昂騰一元一角半至一元　角半、成交總數、計八百九十一萬五千元、茲　其　跌高低比較、列表如左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>一年中　黃金流動</h3>
<p>為二九五，六八〇兩</p>
<p>年來金價昂貴、內地黃金、集中上海而由上海出口者、數亦可驚、茲為明瞭黃金之流動狀　起見、就本年（二十五年）金業交易所現貨現金交割之　量、可見一斑、查本年金業交易所現黃金交割總數共達二萬九千五百六十八條、其中以正月份為最巨、七月份為最少、此乃各路來源及結價　抑抬高之關係、解出者泰半屬於現貨號家、收進者純屬金融界之有力者、是以近來本埠黃金存底、倍極涸竭、標金因扼於結價難於活動、來源遂稀、烚赤竟需照加近三十元、現標金亦較期貨高五元、尙乏供給、此可為黃金垂盡之徵象、茲將二十五年度現金收解細數詳誌於左、</p>

<h3>紗花　紗價曾一度上漲　受三品市場橫漲影響　終為掉期及了結而跌</h3>
<p>紗市初以大阪　品紗市狂騰十二元、有謂　品紗花之頻漲、為自明年以後、一年中輸入澳洲洋毛八十萬包、同時　日本輸往　物一億五千三百七十萬　方碼、因之紗價飛漲、本埠市場人心震湯買氣濃烈而漲、繼以年暮將屆、　二月期交貨充足、多方出檔、抬面鬆懈、市盤轉趨下游、但有一部份多頭、對於遠期仍不放棄也</p>
<p>一月紗獨跌二元餘</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、一月期市氣平靜、因十二月期交貨有七千七百包之巨、人心壓平、但後得大阪三品紗市消息、各月獨跳十二元、這個問題買氣驟盛、二月期突漲　元七角、三月期亦漲三元八角八角、二盤開拍、長豐·裕大在近期大量賣出、檯面　鬆、跌一角至　元九角、但現紗生意尙稱不薄、迨至三收盤平平、結果一月比上日收盤價僅漲三角、遠漲一元二角至　元半、午後開盤本月份市傳某商及某公司掉期出　市況愈　、遠期亦受其影響、市價步　步落、結果各月比上午收盤價跌二元五·六·角角至一元三角、查賣出裕大五千三百五十包、賡豐一千九百包、興昌一千一百包、長豐三千三百包、明德一千六百五十包、潤康一千〇五十包、買進　記一千一百包、　孚八百包、通記一千三百五十包、恒盛　千三百包、慎記一千〇五十包、望泰興一各四百包大昌成一千三百包、協成九百包、福康八百五十包、泰昌一千二百包、一日間最高　價列左、</p>

<p>標花反跌一角左右</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因大阪三品花猛跳二元七八角至三元外、美印棉一致上漲、人心緊俏、各月一律上騰、均跳六·七角、但入後因紗市回挫、市盤受其牽制、結果各月比上日收盤價漲二角半至三角、午後開盤市情甚弱市價步步下跌、因紗市乏力、浮多了結、但日　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　均跌三角半至四角、查　　通　五千二百　　豐三千五百担、大豐一千七百担、錦昌二千六百擔、大慶二千担、昶記三千四百担、望泰興一千七百担大昶六千五百担、生源四千担、長和一萬三百擔、興昌一千二百担潤康四千担、恒益四千二百担、泰興二千二百担、長豐八豐六百担、益康五千七百担、達記二千八百担、合興一千八百担、泰昌三千一百擔、益昌二千三百擔一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<h3>「要做大事先立大志」</h3>
<p>— 高啟鳴</p>
<p>小朋友，我知道你們預備着要做一番大事哩！有的要做科學家像愛迪生。</p>
<p>有的要做文學家像安徒生。</p>
<p>有的要做運動家像歐文思。</p>
<p>有的要做民族英雄像岳飛史可法。</p>
<p>但是小朋友們，你們應該先想一想，要怎樣預備才能夠做成偉大的惠業；這里，我送給你們八個字，就是—</p>
<p>「要做大事先立大志」</p>
<p>要知道。有了偉大的志向，就是立了一個目標在你的面前，你們　抱着志向奮鬥的做去，便可實現你們的大事。小朋友！希望你們立定偉大的志向，預備未來做一番大事。偉大的志向中，希望多產生幾個像岳飛，像史可法，像文天祥，像郭子儀，像戚繼光一樣的民族英雄。</p>
<h3>林肯留鬚的故事</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>我們日常所見的美國解放黑奴自林肯總統肖像，不是滿面鬍鬚的麽？其實他在五十一歲做總統以前，還沒有留鬚哩。他所以留鬚的原故，郤有一段小小故事，當一八六〇年美國選舉總統的時候，林肯是共和黨的總統候選人，共和黨爲宣傳起見，把他的肖像貼在滿街。一個十一歲的小女學生無意中看見那肯像的臉上，修得光光地，便暗忖道，一國的大總統，沒有鬍鬚，不覺得莊嚴；於是伊便寫了一封信，寄給林肯，上面寫的是：「親愛的林肯先生，我想您留了鬚，定此現在好看得多，我有四個哥哥，兩個是共和黨，兩個是民主黨，徜若您聽我的話，留了鬚，我想我能够勸那兩個民主黨的哥哥也投票選舉您。」林肯接了這信，便寫信回覆伊道：「多謝您的好意，不過我倘若聽了您的話，馬上留鬚，您想想，豈不要被入笑我痴情麽？」後來林肯獲選大總統，一日坐火車到那小女孩住的華盛頓州西鎭的時候，便派人把那小女孩領到面前，他一見伊走來，便跳下火車，經過人叢，和伊同坐在車站月台旁邊，他指着臉上道：「小！您瞧，我不是留了麼？我爲了您才留上的，」說着，便和伊很熱烈地親了一吻。但楚從此直到林肯遇刺，他們兩人沒有再會面，那小女孩便把這件事視爲無上光榮，牢記心頭，常常和人談起。小女孩是誰？便是新近才死的坎薩斯州台爾爾福斯鎭八十八歲的老太太皮林斯夫人。</p>

<h3>植物</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>一天，敏兒無意的拔起了一棵小樹，他連自已也不知道拔它起來幹什麽？但他呆呆的對那稞樹看着，便自言自語的說，一稞樹總有這樣的根，莖，葉三部，生這三部有什麼用呢？這個奇怪的開題。倒使他回答不出來了。這樣使他回答不出的疑問，時時在無意中發現着。</p>
<p>「哥哥，你瞧、世界上十之八九的樹木都生着這根，莖，葉三部，那樹木生了這三部有什麽用呢？」</p>
<p>「是的，植物差不多都是生着這三部的，非但有道根，莖，葉三部，但比較高等的植物更有花，果實和植子三部。　根莖葉，花果　種子都呌它們爲器官，根，莖，葉呌營養器官，花，果實，種子呌生殖器官。這六種器官都有特別的構造和功用，但它們的構造不是我們肉眼所能看見的，並且各器官互相合作，來維持植物的生命。講到六種器官的功用，你仔細的一想便可知道的，我不妨先講給你聽聽：根，通常的根都生在泥土中，但也有生在水裏和空氣中的，這不過是例外罷了。生在泥土中的根的功用有二：（一）吸收泥土中的水分和溶解在水中的礦物質，輸送釗莖裏，（二）使植物在地面上的一部分，能夠很堅固的直立在空氣裏，（三）儲藏葉中已製成的養料。莖：莖，都生在空氣中，它的功用有四。（一）把葉展開在空氣裏，使每一片葉都充分的受到陽光，因爲葉在陽光中能製成較多的養料。（二）把由根中所送到的水分和溶解的礦物質，繼續輸送到葉裏去。（三）把葉裏　經製造成的養料，輸送到植物本體的各部、（四）長時期短時期的儲藏養料。葉：葉都者生在莖上，主要的功用便是製造食物。花，果實，種子都是使植物產生小植物，延良它們的種族。不過這六種器官是在高等的植物才有。</p>
<p>什麽呌高等植物？</p>
<p>「植物可分做大類：（一）種子植物，這類都是用種了生殖，是植物界裏最高等的一類，並日和人類有密切的關係。（二）蕨類植物：它是有根莖葉的分別，但它的生殖方法，仍用蕨子生殖，胞子就是一粒子而已，產生這胞子是不用開花的手續，故較種子植物爲低，（三）苔蘚植物：大都生在水中或陰濕的地方，但沒有根。（四）藻菌植物：這是最下等的植物，構造很是簡單，沒有根莖葉的區別」。</p>
<h3>奇怪的水蜘蛛</h3>
<p>— 仲美</p>
<p>「敏哥在那邊水中的是什麽束西呵」，小勇很驚奇的閃着，而同時把小手指着那邊水中的東西，敏哥瞧了一會，於是回答他道：「勇弟，這大槪就是水中的蜘蛛罷」。</p>
<p>「那麽它們在水中呼吸用什麽？是小是像魚兒用鰓呼吸和我們人類用肺呼吸的。」</p>
<p>「它們的呼吸器極奇怪，並不如魚兒用鰓呼吸和我們人類用肺呼吸，是用一種貯氣房，這貯氣房是長圓形，口開的是在下方，它們造的時候並不費力，只須用它們腹中的黏絲，就造成了，它們搬運空氣是利用氣泡的方法，它們爬上水面後，用一對脚一划，就做成一個小小的氣泡，於是把氣泡擱在脚的中間，挾入水中去，到貯氣後把水泡弄破，那氣就昇到貯氣房中，照這樣做了十多决，貯氣房中就貯滿新鮮空氣了。」</p>
<p>「它們在夏天的時候做些什麼工作。」</p>
<p>「它們在夏天要做的工作，就是繁殖水蜘蛛卵的數目常常很多的，的有幾千幾百不等，是用絲做好的殼子把它們放在裏面，沒有許多時候，這些卵都變成小的水蜘蛛，從絲殼裏而爬出來，隔不多時，也一樣會造貯氣房和搬運新鮮空氣了。</p>
<p>「敏哥，它們有什麽用處？」</p>
<p>「它們的用處也很大，常常在水面上帮助我們捉蚊虫和毒蠅，所以它們也是很有益處的動物呢。」</p>
<h3>蝸牛圍蜈蚣記</h3>
<p>— 枕</p>
<p>據常識　斷：蜈蚣是著名的五毒之一，卽有　長的身材，又有最多的健足，所謂「百足之蟲，死而不殭，那裏會有被那細不盈寸，動作遲緩，視若一無所能的標準弱蟲」蝸牛　服之理？　總詫異我們江南人偶見一條蜈蚣在近旁爬行着，想去立卽處死它以免後患，可是用手捉拿又恐皮膚中毒，往往採用着迷信的禁咒方式，口中念念有詞道：「蜒蝣蜒蝣蜒蝣……」這麼地連連呼喚，　說是很效騐地，自會使那蜈蚣頓時白肢無力，爬行呆滯。讓人們得仁寬裕的時間找到一件攻擊的武器，加以殺害的。原來鱖蝣便是蝸牛的俗名；不知爲什麽蜈蚣長懼蝸牛如此其甚，竟至於聞名喪膽？經過我的內兄周銘新醫家眼見過一幕驚心動魄的侵略戰，恰可切實明牠們的尅性自有由來。</p>
<p>一天晚上，周君在無意中瞥見墻脚上有一條很大的蜈蚣，弓起它的身子幾乎對彎而相貼，只用那頭部和尾部兩旁的脚兒支撑站着。這個奇觀引得周君携燈逼視，他便又瞧見那蜈蚣的近旁正有一頭蝸牛，儘自緩緩地繼續它的繞圈遊行的工作。它所經行之處遣留着的黏液閃耀出螺圖形的線路，愈遠處那圍圓愈是疏大，歷歷　覩。在雖極遲緩却不停頓的，愈繞愈小，愈逼愈近的，這眞不離譜的「蝸牛爬墻」的情形之下，蜈蚣的踮起的脚兒站得愈併愈近，那高聳的身子彎得愈貼愈緊，危顫顫的塔似的身形至於上重下輕，它終於無法維持而頹然倒地，同時它的生命也消失無復生理了！</p>
<p>原來蜈蚣是最怕懼蝸牛所排洩的那黏液，非但不敢稍爲觸及，便是聞到了那氣味也不舒服的。可異的是一條蜈蚣所在之處，不知怎樣那蝸牛自會知曉的。它便開始它的戰術，老遠的好像漫不經心地帶着它的黏液繞行着大圈兒，漸繞漸進。那蜈蚣憑恃它的毒氣正在橫行無忌，無章間忽然行近那蝸牛所遺的液線，自會退不迭。經此體騐，它一心要遠而避之。它在初時還優遊自得，却不曾知道它的身子已陷入重圍，不能移動一步。到底被困在內，容身無地，以至於死。</p>
<p>這麽看來，那小小蝸牛，實在不容輕視咧。</p>
<h3>蒂兒病了</h3>
<p>— 重樓</p>
<p>蒂兒是我的外甥女她有一雙流利的眸子，有一個活潑的性情，我從開曾經寫過一篇文字，把她介紹給本刋的小讀者們了。</p>
<p>我和蒂兒分別了數年的時候，今年我回到故鄕去，蒂兒的身軀已長高了許多，她已經不是一個要我抱的孩子了。不過她的性情還是那樣的活潑，看見我總是要我把她吊在臂膀上，像飛機一樣的旋轉。</p>
<p>後來我們去游華山，也帶着蒂兒同去；那樣危險的由路，蒂兒却一點也不怕，她奔走跳躍在山路　，不肯乘坐由輿，跟我們攀着鐵繩，一直到那千尺嶂的峻嶺。</p>
<p>可是自從我回到上海以後，接連接到幾封故鄉的來信，都說是蒂兒生了病，並且說她每天發熱，咳嗽，……恐怕是　期的肺病！這消息使我很焦急，想去看她的病又不能够，只有寫信給家裏敎他們好生調養，療治，現在我心裏時時要牢記她那流利的眸子呢！</p>
<p>小讀者們啊！你們也懷念蒂兒的病嗎？那麽我希望注意衛生，不要使身體發生病才好。</p>
<h3>準備</h3>
<p>— 戶人</p>
<p>天氣漸漸地冷了，蟻兒們都忙忙碌碌地在尋食物，以備過它們的冬天；這天，蟻大哥，在地上找着了一隻死蒼蠅，便慢慢地拖向窠去。</p>
<p>在途中，遇見了它從前鄰居的金甲蟲。</p>
<p>「蟻哥，你好啊？爲什麼整天的這樣忙啊？」金甲蟲很神氣的問。</p>
<p>「噲！老哥！你好？」螞蟻說道這兩天天氣漸冷啦，尋些東西，冬天好吃哇」。</p>
<p>「唔！你那忒傻啦！你看我整天的跑東跑西，一些沒有事做，多麽適意！像你老是做工，眞是大傻子，眞是個大傻子，哈哈……」金甲蟲很驕傲地狂笑了一陣走去了。</p>
<p>蟻大哥望着它的背影，搖頭長嘆，仍拖　食物回窠去。</p>
<p>西北風一天緊一天了，樹葉都括盡了，外面的景况也不知怎麽樣了，蟻大哥趁這大太陽光好一點的時候，出去走走，在路中會見金甲蟲臥在地上不　了。</p>
<h3>狐狸和白鵝</h3>
<p>— 張一志</p>
<p>有一天，狐狸肚裏餓極了，走到河邊，看見河裏有一隻白鵝，就想從白鵝來吃。</p>
<p>它騙白鵝道：一朋友，我來吿訴你一個好消息：前天鳥獸們在山上開會，議决自後不許互相殘殺。因此今天在山上開一個慶祝會，我特地來請你去參加，你快跟我走吧」</p>
<p>白鵝聽了心裏想：狐狸是著名的狡猾東西，這番或許不會懷着好意。　就伸着頭頸，向前面望着，不睬狐狸。</p>
<p>好一會，狐狸不耐煩的說：「你瞧見了什麼？怎麽儘是瞧着不睬我？你究竟去不去？」</p>
<p>白鵝忽露出驚慌的樣子說：「我看見兩隻狗，搖着尾巴向這裏很快的走來」！</p>
<p>狐狸是最怕狗的，聽說有狗來，心裏害拍極了，身子不禁索索的抖着，要想逃走。</p>
<p>白鵝笑道：「狐先生，你剛才不是說，鳥獸們已經議决自後不許自相殘殺嗎？怎麼你還怕狗呢」？</p>
<p>我們看了上面的童話，可得到三個敎訓：</p>
<p>一：生活在社會上，必須誠實。欺騙手段，不能取信於人，反失自己的信譽。</p>
<p>二：偶然聽得的話，要審察是否可靠，不可輕信。</p>
<p>三：白鵝不輕信狐狸的話，是白鵝的審愼；白鵝用計試探狐狸眞偽，是白鵝的機警。</p>

<h3>寫給全國小朋友的一封信</h3>
<p>— 知本小學五年級生吳品賢</p>
<p>全國親愛的小朋友：最近僞匪軍侵擾綏遠，用許多飛機大砲，日夜進攻，而綏遠守土的將士，在冰天雪地，身背長槍，手　大刀，不畏飢寒，不惜犧牲，和敵人　戰，爲國家而奮鬥，爲民族而爭光，他們的精神，我們應該怎樣的景仰，怎樣的敬佩呢！</p>
<p>諸位要知道，綏遠並不是綏遠將士的綏遠，也不是綏遠人民的綏遠，是全國人民的綏遠，大家應該保衛他，我們小朋友，雖說年齡尙幼，不能作戰疆塲，惟愛國心不應落在人後，也應該在後方負點接濟的責任，我希望全國小朋友，一致起來援綏，把每天買糖果買玩具的錢，節省下來，集在一起，轉給前方一班英雄的將士，作爲他們一切的需用。希望小朋友們，從　以後，趕快的節省起來，負起我們的責任吧！不多寫了再會！祝你們前進！</p>
<p>妹吳品賢敬上十二，三，</p>

<h3>深海夢遊記</h3>
<p>— 江中魚作</p>
<p>（十七）敏兒抬起來一望，見一條頭上有發光器的大黑魚，遠遠的游來。（十八）他就驚惶地去躱在貝殼傍邊。（十九）他見那大黑魚很快的游過去，他心裏安慰了一些。二十）忽然接着父來了一條兇暴的鮟鏮魚。（二十一）那兩條巨魚過去以後，又來一條怪樣的闊嘴魚，這時候眞把敏兒怕得氣也不敢透了！</p>
<h3>孝（十）</h3>
<p>— 海</p>
<p>這是一個快樂的復活節堂日，在那希臘禮拜堂中？凡是意見不合的都到此言歸於好了。人家彼此遇見時，繼德含笑相迎說道：「耶穌基督是升起來了。」一方面也就答道：他眞的是升起來了；」於是彼此接吻，卽使雙方有什麼意見這時也完全忘懷了。</p>
<p>柏絲可菲正在和伊就把自己替父親前來請命的經過訴說了出來；那位先生很注意於伊，連忙將伊介紹給他，伊就把自己替父親前來。命的經過訴說了出來；那位先生很注意於伊，對伊很表同情，但是切實的對伊說：向上議院中去請求是沒有用的；因爲伊卽使能得到上議院中的帮助，重行審査伊父親的案件，一定是很磨煩，並且很費時間的，而有沒有平反的希望，也沒有什麽把握；所以還是直接去向亞歷山大皇帝請求，他要是肯一發慈悲之心，那就達到目的了。</p>
<p>柏絲　菲很高興的回到商人那裏去，笑着說這一回的事情倒眞的要感謝那彼得大帝像的，因爲那時要是不向他瞧，伊就不會留心尼佛河已經開凍。此刻那商人恰好從里加回來，知道了柏絲司菲的事情，並沒有什麼進步，他就立刻帶了伊去見那位梯郡主，郡主是一位年老的太太，很溫和的接待柏絲可菲，並且留伊住在來裏。可是一連幾天，郡主的邸第中，總是奉行着熱鬧的宴會，大家都玩着紙牌，那年老的那主和一般賓客都已忘却了柏絲可菲的使命，可憐伊老是一天天的在屋子裏，旁皇着，心中非常的焦急，覺得那無限的希望，怕不免失望的了。伊記得郡主曾勸伊去見一位維先生，他是皇太后瑪麗的秘書，定可給伊設法的。於是俘就接到維先生的家裏去，維先生恰好不在家裏，但他早已知道伊要來是他，以爲是家裏窮苦而求仙周濟來的，因此預先留下了五十個盧布，給伊帶回去。維夫人却瞧見了伊，很爲歡喜，聽伊訴說了前後的經過，很爲感動，就留住了伊，等候維先生回來。維先生回來之後，知道了這回事，也表示熱烈的同情，立刻趕去見皇太后。伊老人家也是世界中一個最溫和最慈善的婦人。命令維先生常晚帶同柏絲可菲前來覲見。可憐的女孩子一聽得了這好消息，連臉色都泛白了，兩眼中滿含着眼淚。已來不及向維先生道謝，向天歡呼着道：一我的上帝，我始終的信任你，到底是不錯的。」當下，伊又親着維夫人的手嚷道；「太太，你得接受我的感謝，因爲你的奴丈夫已救了我的父親了！」</p>
<p>柏絲可菲不管自己身上穿着什麼衣服，也不管朝見皇太后的什麽禮節：伊那單純的心中，只有一個爲父請命的志願。維夫人只把伊隨身的衣服整理了一下，就喚俘跟着維先生同去。柏絲可菲一見了面前的皇宮，就歡天喜地的說道：「此刻我的父親要是看見了我，他是多麽的快樂呀！我的上帝。完成了你的工作吧！」</p>

<p>名人訪問記</p>
<h3>從綏遠前方歸來京周</h3>
<p>— 景差</p>
<p>寵京周先生這决爲了救護綏遠剿匪將士事，不辭長途跋涉，不憚泳天雪地辛苦，特地趕到前綫去主持救護傷兵事宜。當他這次由前方回來，熟心的社會人士紛紛地去拜候他，並殷勤地詢問受傷士兵的情形。筆者由胡蕙如女士之紹介，也去訪問過龐先生。龐先生身軀魁梧龐大，濃眉大眼，一口舊京白講得很好，他那藹然可親的態度，使我想起在「一二八」滬戰時也曾看見過他，不過沒有直接和他談話罷了，那時，他同丁惠康醫師們都很努力地爲滬戰抗敵受傷將士們服務過。</p>
<p>「這决眞正辛苦了你了！」</p>
<p>『不，做醫生本來是爲了救護人類，而况是爲了我們民族抗戰的將士呢？」</p>
<p>「前方的情形怎麽樣？」</p>
<p>「我在報紙上發表的談話想來你已看見了，目前看上去，更覺得救謎工作是十分要緊的！」</p>
<p>「聽說您要組織大規模的救護隊再往前錢去，何時可以實現呢？」</p>
<p>「這便是救護事業協進會訓練推行會所組織的訓練班了。這可以說完全是爲了綏遠救傷而組織的。同時，會中本有很多外界組成的救護班在加緊訓練，一到應有學識學習完畢，卽行前往服務。但現在該會已經决定自辦了。現在先辦一所，暫定地點爲成都路和安小學。並且已由會方把聘請敎員的責任交付給我，不到幾天就可開學了。現在已分別通知錄取了的學員。」</p>
<p>「關於應用藥品和包紮紗布等物件有人捐助嗎？」</p>
<p>「這一次也不减於「一二八」！只要有人提倡或者說明是必需品，就會有人大批的捐來。我這次剛從前方回來時，不過隨意講了一點關於前方需要的如禦寒禦毒等物品，不到幾天，就已經彙集了不少運到前方去，這已見報載，用不着我再來報吿數目了！」</p>
<p>「藥品等物共捐了多少呢？」</p>
<p>「該會本組織得有一個藥物供應委員會，據統計，本市各藥房慨捐急救藥包已達十三萬隻左右，這還是三四天前的話。此外，由各處直接送往紅十字會的也很多。眞是數也數不淸！」</p>
<p>「我想前錢的救護工作大槪很艱難吧？」</p>
<p>「當然很艱難，不過，有時精神的奮發倒很能克服一切。雖是在冰天雪地往往零度以下的天氣中，但從事工作的却仍熱血沸騰，而不致縮手縮脚做不來事。不過，爲了使工作加强起見，對於訓練救護人才，我們很注重於精神訓話和常識問題。」</p>
<p>他說到這裏，便給了我一個極强度的印象，他那還帶着風塵之色的面龐上，從黃色皮膚裏透出紅潤，濃黑的鬚眉表示出莊重而威嚴，但又是極和平鎭靜的。我又進一步問他；</p>
<p>「精神訓話是怎麽一回事？」</p>
<p>「救護前線傷者的工作和平時看護情形絕不相同。前者是動的工作，後者是靜的工作。而且往往是含有充分胃險性和犧牲精神的！必須不慌不忙，細心細意，從容而又敏捷，更要能臨機應變。以我自己的觀察來說；如果訓練生手，必須先使他或她們知道一些重要的戰時常識，常識一豐富，便不致於心慌意亂，無所措手了，然後再以國家民族，救亡圖存的觀念，鼓勵起工作人員犧牲勇敢的精神！」</p>
<p>「我佩服機了！這眞是我們綏遠前線抗敵將士們的幸福！」</p>
<p>「抗敵將士們莫說是眞能有人悉心救護，就是聽見一兩句鼓勵他們的話，他們都是很激發地感動的。這在「一二八」時就已給了我們一個經騐。這决我們當然更要雜力，但有時，我也極爲在</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>前線努力的健兒們那種精神所鼓勵着。所以，我相信現在的精神訓話不過是一種應備的手續。如果工作人員到了前線，我相信他們精神上更可得到不可思議的鼓勵！」</p>
<p>「聽說僞匪們竟是那樣的殘暴蠻橫，連救護的人也有不免被作爲攻擊目標的。」</p>
<p>「進攻基督敎堂，殺死敎友的事件，曾聽見發生過，至於救護工作，則因爲我們老早料到這點，已預爲防範，所以還沒有發生甚麼不幸事。」</p>
<p>「是的，報上也揭載過敎會司鍔易世芳君指揮敎友開土砲抗敵，而得到傅作義先生嘉慰的事！」我接着又說；「目前前方戰事大槪又移到綏東方面了吧？」</p>
<p>「現在敵人處心積慮回興和方面覬覦。爲了那裏東北部毘連張北商都。張北是僞匪的根據地，也同從前克復的百靈廟一樣。敵人也知道我軍根據地是在山西，而興和的南部却又正接着長城和山西的門戶天鎭陽高，而且集寗也近在咫尺。敵人北侵再四敗退，要想入包頭已經絕望，那便只有向興和進攻之一策了。」</p>
<p>談到這裏，見來訪的人已不少，於是我便告辭而退。</p>

<h3>介紹「戰爭與間諜」</h3>
<p>— 坎孚</p>
<p>——英國路威著，胡愈之譯，生活書店出版，每冊定價三角——</p>
<p>世界在一個大戰的前夜里，火藥的氣息瀰漫着整個的歐洲和太平洋，只要稍有常識的人，都知道第二次大戰的威脅，是一天天的向我們更加迫近了</p>
<p>就在這個時候，各國間除努力從事於軍備的競爭以外，並熱烈的進行着間諜的戰爭，他們爲要刺探他國軍事上的秘密，爲要了解他國外交上的活　，不惜每年花費鉅大的金錢，利用各種巧妙的方法，以組織自己的間諜網。所以，現在各國間的戰爭雖還沒有正式爆發，可是間諜戰爭却早已開始了。因之，使許多國家都鬧着間諜的恐慌，不久以前，新加坡不是破獲了很大的間諜機關嗎？而我們東鄰的友邦，不也是發現過美國武官利用婦女刺探軍情的桃色事件嗎？甚至蘇聯國內也發現過德國方面大規模的間諜組織，這一切都向我們說明；一九一四年前間諜活躍的狀態，又重新再現於今日了。</p>
<p>正因爲我們世界上佈滿了間諜的活動，所以，近年來歐美各國關於間諜一類的傳說，迥憶錄，小說和論著，已成爲最流行的通俗讀物了。「但其中大部份的著作，因爲過分迎合庸俗的心理，往往偵探小說化，甚至神話化了，完全失却了歷史的價値。」比較上，只有英國路威（Rowan）所著的「戰爭與間諜」一書，還有値得推荐的價値。</p>
<p>這本書最近已由胡愈之先生譯出來了，作爲世界知識叢書之一，由生活書店發行。內容共分十四章。第一章是「現代戰爭與間諜」，在這一章裏，他首先說明了現代戰爭與間諜的關係，他認爲「間諜工作已成爲現代戰爭中所必不可缺的一件東西，」「間諜和軍隊最大的一個不同的地方，就是軍隊只能在戰時活動，而間諜活動則不分戰時和平時」，同時，他還指出間諜的活動是現社會中一種道德的矛盾，在目前是無法解决的。第二章「現代間諜制度的發展」，主要的是說明；從一八七〇年俾士麥著名的偵探長史蒂白從事工作以來，問諜術這門獨立科學的發展。第三章是說明間諜工作的基本原则。第四五六三章是專門討論間諜的情報工作，傳遞方法與女間諜的問題，作者對於歐戰時代的間諜活動情形非常熟習，每說明一項事情，都在歷史上舉出許多極動人的故事來加以申述。例如，歐戰时德國如何在英法等國佈置問諜，法比等國如何利用極巧妙的方法傳遞情報，英國間諜如何在深海中去探索已沉的敵軍潛水艇，協的國如何截獲德軍的密電碼，以及各種各樣的秘密通信方法。在他的叙述中，就好比聽傳奇的故事」樣，不僅有濃厚的趣味，而且令人異常的驚心動魄。</p>
<p>但是，單是說明間諜的工作還不够的。因爲各有了間諜工作，同時也必須有反間諜的工作。「所謂反間諜，表面和間諜互相對立，實際上却不然。假如間諜所担任的是進攻，那麽反間諜所担任的是防守。進攻和肪守不是相反而是相成」，換句話說，反間諜就是間諜的間諜，也可說是史高一級的間諜。所以，這種間諜在目前的各個國家是更重要的。這也就是各國用以防止他國間諜，保障本國秘密的重要工具。</p>
<p>所以，在第七，八，九三章中，著者對於反間諜制度說得非常詳細，如關於反問諜制度建立的歷史，方法，以及秘密警察，書信檢査和歐戰前後」切反間諜的動人故事，使我們讀了之後，對於防止敵人活動的方法上，至少是可以得到許多帮助的。</p>
<p>第十章談的是「宣傳」，是談的利用間諜造謠言，煽動軍心的方法，著者還舉出歐戰時奧軍利用謠言大敗意軍，使全軍五十萬人大受損失的故事。</p>
<p>最後四章，著者用來叙述近幾世紀中許多名震一時的問諜。第一個是俾士麥的偵探長史蒂白，第二個是拿破崙的間諜胥爾梅斯德，其决是歐戰中兩個著名的女間諜。「博士姑娘」和舞女瑪泰哈莉，再决是歷史上著名的間諜，如魯濱孫飄流記的作者狄福，十八世紀的間諜台翁，同時他也叙述了一些鹵莽的間諜以及他們的笑話，非常有趣。</p>
<p>這本書的作者路威對間諜術極有研究，書中所搜集的史料也相當豐富而精審，在了解近代間諜制度的發展和國際問諜的活動上是非常重要的。胡先生的譯筆異常流麗，讀之不但使人不會感到讀的是翻譯的作品，而且好像是在讀小說一樣。</p>
<p>不過，這本書也有相當的缺點，第一，他所談的多是歐戰前後的故事，對於目前世界的間諜戰毫未提及，第二，對於美國日本的問諜情形根本沒有叙述，第三，他底國家觀念太深，雖然經過譯者的斧削，但是，他對於帝國主義壓迫弱小民族以及其他方面的暴露還不充分。雖然這樣，但這本書對於目前我們中國仍是非常需要的。因爲，我們目前正當着一個嚴重的民族的危機，帝國主義對我們的間諜活動正發生着很大作用，因之，以民族自衛爲目的的間諜活動與反間諜活動，也是我們目前所非常需要的。因爲這是一種非武裝的戰鬥組織，在我們是不應當放棄的。這本書的出版，無疑地會給我們對這一問題的了解上以很大的帮助和啟示。</p>

<h3>街頭藝術品</h3>
<p>— 魯人</p>
<p>通常被人注意的藝術，是陳列館或展覽室裏所陳列的西洋畫，水彩畫，塑像，浮雕，版畫，木刻，而不是街頭的藝術，殊不知十字街頭也有我們的藝術家在那裏辛辛苦苦地创作他的藝術作品呢。</p>
<p>在那鄙靜的，湫隘的小街小巷口—不是那華貴的南京路上，我們每每看見一羣小孩擁做一團，圍着一個揑糖人兒的挑担的小販。在那些藝術家的心目中，在那些藝術品鑑賞家的心目中，是决不會　　　到藝術之宮」以外還有這無名的　　的　然而　般貧　的小孩，窮困的人們，他們却有他們自己的藝術，這街頭捏糖人兒的小販便是他們心目中的藝術家。</p>
<p>說也奇怪，同是一樣的糖，除了極簡單的工具外，完全都靠他一雙手做成白十種的東西。在我參觀的短短幾十分鐘內，他已作成了一只烏龜，一條蛇，一個靑蛙，一根龍，一隻鳥。據他說；他不但能做蝴蝶，魚，時鐘，算盤，老鼠等等日常所見的食物，而且還能作各色各樣的人物，如關公，張飛之之類，同現在的戲班上出塲的關公，張飛一樓一樣。</p>
<p>我們的街頭藝術家，他懂　　歷史，比　歷史的人還　得　那　　　的人該穿那一種衣服，那些人該拿那些武器</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>，甚麼人是白臉，甚麼人應塗紅臉，這些舊劇家的臉譜學，他也完全懂得。在他的作品中，連面部的表情，眉和眼的姿式，各入都有一定的特色。把兩個關公放在一起，簡直使你分辨不出那是那個來。也他會揑漂亮的摩登女郞，他也揑西裝革履的少年。他看一樣會一樣。他能作飛機，火車，輪船。世界上發明了一件東西，似乎在他的担子上也可發現出同樣的東西來。</p>
<p>還有，他懂得一般的兒童心理學，以迎合無數兒童的心理。他所揑的東西，必是小孩心中所喜歡的東西。小孩口裏所要的，他也能不假思索地馬上給他捏出來。他能與小孩周旋。不怕好多小孩和他搗亂，打他，擠他，搶他的糖人，妨碍他的工作，他都不發氣，而且能應付裕如。他在許多小孩爭先搶糖人時，他能使他們依次取貨面不爭吵。一方面要趕工作，一方面又要防小孩偸東西，而一方面又要防備來驅逐他的巡捕或警察。這同那坐在「藝術之宮裏靜心製作藝術品的藝術家，眞有天淵之別。</p>
<p>他又在担子的一端設一磨盤，呌小孩出一個銅板來賭勝負，輸贏都給他們糖吃。一副担子，又當桌子用，又常檯盤用，又當坐位用。他的心裏很快活，一天到晚都在做藝術品，而又與那些天眞爛漫的小朋友爲伍，他也是小朋友們所頂喜歡的朋友。這同那些文縐縐的藝術家，常常都閙着「煩悶」呵，「苦惱，呵，也不有同。</p>
<p>費不了五分鐘，我眼見着他作了兩條蛇。蛇的顏色是靑花的菜色。他把綠色和黃色的糖很巧妙地揉合起來，便如畫家配色一樣，成爲靑花的蛇的顏色。一塊扁圓的糖，一轉眼就拉長了，似眞蜿蜓着的一條蛇。蛇的斑紋是用一柄斷了的木梳來印的。他這木梳，比那糜登女郞在電車上從皮夾中取出來的梳子，自然不値錢些，但是牠的用處就大得多了。不但做蛇的斑紋，而且又印成人和動物的手指，又可印成頭髮。一柄斷梳，其功用之宏，實出人意表之外！</p>
<p>蛇是盤在一幅硬紙片上的。頭最複雜，也最有趣。有口中吐出的鬍子。有兩隻晶亮的眼睛。他不僅能做出各種單個的動物，而且能如畫家一樣，把各種動物配合起來，得其勻稱。在蛇的面前置一靑蛙，蛇望着要咬牠，而那靑蛙則有如越王勾踐在途中所遇着的怒蛙，表示出不肯屈服的樣子。</p>
<p>這位街頭藝術家有如法國大文豪莫泊桑，他所描寫的題材是細小的，瑣碎的，日常見慣的，俯拾卽是的。像這樣的藝術家，還有做小玩意的兒，畫廣吿畫的，玩把戲的。他們眞的是民衆藝術家呢。</p>
<h3>侵略的先鋒隊</h3>
<p>— 金岳</p>
<p>這世間有許多我們所意想不到的人，我這位初次識面的朋友便是其中的一個。</p>
<p>我與他認識，是在一個朋友的家裏，他剛倒在床上抽大烟，經過朋友介紹以後，他用着近視的眼睛向我一看，大槪因爲我的朋友在他面前爲我說了許多話，先入爲主地使他感覺到我是一個可以承受他相當敬禮的一個人。－其實，我只是一個一無所能一無所有的窮漢－他霍然地放下烟槍，用着手指夾定了他那副近視的眼鏡，再向我周身上下看了一看，然後放着喉嚨說；一呵！金先生，請坐，幾時到？我們正在念你，呵！請坐，喝茶，上海生意不好啊！我們正在念你呢！請坐，那麼，抽口大烟。」他一口氣說了這麽多的話，他要我坐，喝茶，又要我抽烟，他全不想到我只是一個人，我不能同時分出身體來做這許多事。而且，在那種紛亂的情景之中，我不知應當回他說些什麽話，我只得一面脫去長衫，一面連聲說着；「好，好，你倒，不客氣，你喝，你抽。」</p>
<p>如響斯應般地他居然照着我的話做着，他坐起來喝了一杯茶，又倒下去抽烟了。</p>
<p>我的朋友向他說；「金先生旅居厦門很久，曾在報界做過事，新近是從北平方面來的。」</p>
<p>一談到北平，我那位初决識面的朋友又放下他的烟槍向我說；。「北平，皇帝都，那裏有皇帝殿啊。」</p>
<p>我是愛好北平，而且也愛與人談談北平的。我向他約略地說到皇宮內各種壯麗的情形，臨後，我說到那御用的黃金印。「似方硯」般大，大約十多塊，黃閃閃的。」</p>
<p>金子動人心，他從床上跳起來了，喊着說；「十多塊？天啦，那不是要十多萬塊錢麼？」</p>
<p>「是的，大的要幾萬塊錢吧」我點着頭說，但他却不只是點頭而已，而且還把頭拚命地搖着，頭搖完以後，接著嘆口氣說；「北平！你看！北平」</p>
<p>他要我們看北平，但看什麼呢？凡到過北平的人都愛北平，那裏有都市的繁華，同時也有鄕村的靜意。但在他的心目中，北平却只有十多顆黃閃閃的御用余印。</p>
<p>從北牛的御用金印的談話中，我的略地了解了我那位初識面朋友的愛好。而且在那瀰漫的烟霧裏，我也的略地認識了他的形容；一副鼠一般的近視眼，瘦到無可再瘦的面龐底下長着幾根雜亂的短鬚，染着鴉片的細長的指爪。</p>
<p>他臨去時很熱意似地要我到他家裏去玩，而且還肯空出房間給我去住，我一一道謝過了。我也跟着朋友送他出門，並說了再會。我很願意與他再作一番詳細的談話，並很想知道他是怎樣地活在人間。從朋友的談話中，我曉得　　以下接第五版</p>

<p>他姓王，而且是一爿錢莊的老板。</p>
<p>他自己雖很瘦，却有一位很肥胖的老板娘，還有一位頗有姿容的妹子。</p>
<p>他還有幾個婢女，如今都長大了，都很能够爲王老板賺錢。婢子出堂差時，如果是有錢的客人，王老板娘是時常跟在後面的。</p>
<p>王老板很能救濟窮人，經濟困難的人可向他錢莊裏借錢，借一百元只實得八十五元，餘十五元做利息，以一個月爲限，到期交還一百元。王老板是籍民，一切的事都有靠山，他不怕人走他的債。</p>
<p>王老板的住房很寬敞，樓下是錢莊，一樓是老板娘的臥室。據王老板說，因爲三樓空着可惜，所以把一半給朋友做俱樂部，朋友在那裏賭錢抽大烟，王老板也可以每月抽到幾百塊賭頭。還有一半，據說是給婢子們去玩，王老板對於她們似不很關心，不過在沒有客人來同婢子們一同玩的時候，，王老板是要她們來莊烟與泡茶的。</p>
<p>因此，王老板現在很富足，據他自己對人說；他是有靠近十萬的家當了。</p>
<p>過了幾天，我又在朋友的家裏看見王老板。</p>
<p>從他的談話中，我又知他是愛賭「十一枝」的人。他說；「我前夜夢見兩頭猪，猪頭長起兩隻角，站在我母親面前。猪是黑象，我押黑象，押十元，中了。」</p>
<p>我覺得王老板不會打誑語，像他這種人應時常做夢，他會夢見惡魔在喫人，也會夢見狼虎嚼他的骨頭的。</p>
<p>他向人說；「押！從一元起，一元贏十元，再押，十元變百元，百元變千元，再押，千元變一萬元，十萬元，百萬元。媽你的，把厦門二一十多個賭塲都押到倒閉，讓我們來發財。」</p>
<p>有一位朋友向他說；「如果三十幾個賭塲都倒閉了，那厦門還好住嗎？每個賭塲至少可養活四五十個流氓，三十多個賭塲便養活一二千個流氓，賭塲都倒閉了，試問呌道一二千流氓到那裏去討生活？你的錢莊怕會發生危險，你的女人怕不好帶金器出門呢。」</p>
<p>雖然這位朋友的政治主張是不大高明，但我們的王老板却全不管這些事情，他只是說；「押！大家押！押他個倒閉。」</p>
<p>王老板對於這些賭塲經琊好像有夙世的寃仇似的，後來據我調査的結果，纔知道原來是因爲有一爿賭塲不肯給他加入做股東的緣故。</p>
<p>有一天，爲着好奇心所驅使，我居然同朋友去拜訪王老板。</p>
<p>在樓下錢莊裏，我看見他那位肥胖的老板娘和他那位穿着紅色旗袍的妹子。在二層樓一裏，我看見王老板倒在床上抽烟。</p>
<p>他一看見我們，立卽放下烟槍，一而招呼我們坐，一面張着喉嚨向樓下喊着；「來喲！泡一壺茶。」</p>
<p>我們都坐下來，談了許多話，而茶還沒有泡來。</p>
<p>「來喲！泡一壺茶，鐵觀音，加量的。再買兩個鷄蛋糕，五根香蕉。」王老板又繼續地向樓下喊着。</p>
<p>過了　　　五分鐘，茶與香烟還是沒有送來。</p>
<p>我想，大約老板娘不大理會王老板的吩咐，而樓上的婢女們又恰好有生意吧。樓上有打牌的聲音，也有女人與男人嬉笑的聲音，大的王老板今夜裏至少又可有百把塊錢進賬吧</p>
<p>但正當我想得要發笑的常兒，王老板却忽然地提出一個問題來了。</p>
<p>「是不是？金先生，我說做人要仁義禮智信，我們要相信孔子公，耶穌上帝，菩薩，土地公，是不是？金先生。」</p>
<p>但我那時實在不能向王老板解答這一問題，其實，王老板也不需要我的解答，所以我只是這樣地問着；「這幾天做些什麼夢，王老板？」</p>
<p>說到夢的上面，王老板便更加起勁，他大聲地說。。「有，昨天又夢見一隻猪，倒霉，一到天亮就忘了，一直等開了十二枝，是黑象，才想起來，眞倒霉，昨天輸了十塊錢，今天贏不轉來。」</p>
<p>「呵！又夢到猪。」</p>
<p>「是的，出奇，我常常夢到猪。</p>
<p>我們一似談了很多的話，但茶與香蕉還是不來。王老板也許爲着自己需要喝茶，因而他眞發怒了。他曉得在床上喊茶與香蕉是不會發生效力的，於是勉强地爬下床來，一面指着脚上的疔瘡向我們說；「唉！你們看，面上兩粒，脚上兩粒，一共四粒，疔瘡哪，都是疔瘡，疼的要命，昨夜沒有帶手電燈出鬥，碰着石獅，破了，流了兩杯血，噯喲，痛得要命。」王老板這樣說着拐着，一直拐到樓梯頭，才伸着頭頸向樓下喊着；　見　　　　　　　香蕉喲！」</p>
<p>「去買沒有來啦！拚命的喊幹嗎？」老板娘些發怒發了。於是，站在樓梯頭　王老板，不聲不響地靜默二分鐘，然後才拐到床邊，爬上去裝起烟來抽着。</p>
<p>茶與香蕉終於給一個最小的婢女拿來，王老板　時却發怒了。他拿着竹片向婢子身上截了幾下，駡着說；「你這臭ｘ，ｘ你娘，你到那裏去了？婊仔生的。」虎虎的雄風在王老板短而且亂的髭鬚裏透露着，王老板在這時候是確實有點英雄氣慨的。</p>
<p>經過我們說情以後，王老　終於放了婢子，而去談他的正經話。</p>
<p>他要求我替他做一件事</p>
<p>據王老板說，有　與　換帖的弟兄，全不顧　德仁　，把他婢子的首飾騙去附錢。　天有時不生眼睛，他偏賭贏了錢，也　買了幾　婢子來做生意。而且，他偶要住在王老板的隔壁。據王老板的意思，　切都可看　帖弟兄的情義，不與計較。只是這幾個婢女實在　臭賤了，他時常把王老板樓上的朋友誘騙過去，這是很使王老板難　的。因爲王老板很担心自已樓上的朋友，這些朋友都很年輕，假使給隔壁那些在王老板以爲是臭賤的婢女們騙壞了，那不是對不住朋友而失了信義嗎？因此，他不得不請求我的帮忙，至於怎樣帮忙，王老板對於這事是胸有成竹的。他輕聲地對我說：「這在你先牛很便當，他不是眞正籍民，又沒有向中國官廳領過牌，你只要把　做一則新　，他就不得不搬走了。」</p>
<p>我這才恍然大悟，原來王老板的　與香蕉是與仁義相關。而在那時我也確曾喝了王老板的茶，因此，我雖不曾直接答應他的要求，但我却不能不預祝他多做幾　準確的夢，可以多押中幾回上二枝。</p>
<p>在事實上，王老板在那一夜裏也確曾做了一個夢，不過這個夢不是一隻猪頭上長起兩個角，而是一隻狗與一隻貓相咬。</p>
<p>在第二天下午，我的朋友向我說。。「王老板娘今天大駡王老板，因爲王老板的夢不準確，使她輸了　多塊錢。」</p>

<h3>研究昆蟲學者須知怎樣自製昆蟲標本？</h3>
<p>— 子雲</p>
<p>有一個西國朋友，他是一個昆蟲　專家，所以他非常歡喜製作動物標本，以供研究之用。在他客廳的四壁上，差不多全是一匣一匣瑰麗的蝴蝶，蜻蜓，以及許多其他種類的甲殼蟲；大家都認爲這比屛條字畫還要好看，還要有意義些。下面便是他所吿訴我的製作昆蟲標本的簡單法則。</p>
<p>必需的工具；剪刀一柄，需頭尖而直的，用以分離動物的各部。鑷子一柄，通常所用多爲小而尖者，用以撮物，惟恐用手指拾取，有汚損之弊。止蟲鑷一把；刺動物於板上時，若用手壓入，易使釘針彎曲，且栘動標本時，常損壞物體，所以用止蟲鑷來鉗住針的尖端，或拔出，或刺下，均極方便。捕蟲網一個，用以捕捉昆蟲；網長的二尺半，口徑的尺半，張以蚊帳紗，漸漸由口徑縮小成圓錐形，縫其口於鐵圈之上，圈上裝以木柄，長的四尺。玻璃瓶二三隻，以圓而有蓋者爲最合宜，中貯靑化鉀少許，上蓋棉花或布一層，可以作毒瓶畜養器。刺蟲臺一座，以木爲之，共分二級，每級有孔，須能使昆蟲針頭穿過。展翅板一套，用長方形木板一塊，兩旁向內側，中留一溝，用以展平昆蟲之翅；若無此板，則用玻璃片疊作二排，中留一溝亦可。濕蟲器一個，用一大玻璃缸，中盛飽和水分的沙約二吋，再加入二硫化炭及石炭酸各數滴，以防菌類發生。缸的中部，置一鐵絲網，網上放置將拿去展翅的標本。若無此濕蟲器，昆蟲的翅便很容易破碎，而製出來的標本也就小美觀了。此外　需要昆蟲針若干。這些工具都可自製，同時各科學儀器社也有發售。</p>
<p>必需的藥品；（一）麻醉劑，最合用的爲哥羅芳，（二）保存劑，以酒精爲最佳，（三）防腐劑，樟腦粉或樟腦丸最爲通用。</p>
<p>製作標本最好在春末夏初，因爲那時百花齊開，昆蟲最多。現在試將製法分做幾類來講</p>
<p>關於鱗翅類的，如樟蠶蛾，金鳳蝶，蛺蝶等類都是，一這類昆蟲的標本格外美麗有趣。捕捉樟蠶蛾須在夜問，先塗誘蛾糖於樹皮上，夜半掌燈至樹下，便看見糖上有不少的蛾正在吸吮，於是用毒瓶輕輕將蛾撮入。待毒死後，用鑷鉗出，放在展翅板上，其法將蛾的身體置　　以下接第九版</p>

I am even more saddened and concerned for the comrades and soldiers who suffered during the incident. Fortunately, the central authorities have managed the situation appropriately, and the national military and political authorities have fulfilled their duties, maintaining national stability as usual.

Over the past two weeks, I have been deeply moved by the warm concern of compatriots and comrades everywhere. I regret that my sincerity was insufficient and my guidance was inadequate, causing this extraordinary upheaval in the nation, adding to the worries of our compatriots. Reflecting on my responsibilities, I feel deeply indebted and should apologize to the Central Government and the compatriots of the entire nation. Since this incident, the unanimous enthusiasm of our compatriots in protecting the nation has demonstrated a great and unparalleled force. This force is the primary reason for stabilizing the precarious situation today and will be the guarantee for the success of our national rejuvenation in the future. This is what I, Zhongzheng, dare to celebrate for the future of the nation, despite my feelings of guilt and shame. I sincerely express my feelings and hope for our joint efforts.

<h3>Zhang Xueliang Petitions Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to Punish Him Severely; To Uphold Discipline and Warn Future Generations, He Would Die Ten Thousand Times Without Regret; Do Not Be Concerned About Private Feelings and Have Reservations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang arrived in Nanjing at a little after 2:00 PM on the 26th. Upon arrival, he wrote a letter to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, expressing his intention to await punishment in Nanjing. The original letter is recorded as follows: "To Generalissimo Jiegong: Xueliang is by nature reckless and crude, and has committed the great crime of violating discipline and disrespect in this incident. I now come to Nanjing shamelessly, with utmost sincerity, to receive your punishment and be subjected to the punishment I deserve, to uphold discipline and warn future generations. I would die ten thousand times without regret for anything that benefits our country. I beg you not to be concerned about private feelings and have reservations. Xueliang is uneducated and cannot fully express myself. I humbly ask for your understanding of my humble sincerity. I respectfully salute you, Zhang Xueliang, sincerely, 26th." (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>Generalissimo Chiang's Address to Zhang and Yang Before Leaving Shaanxi; Sincere and Moving, Extremely Detailed; Recorded Personally by Madam Chiang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Before Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek left Xi'an, he summoned Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng for a very detailed address, which was recorded by Madam Chiang. The original text is as follows: "This Xi'an Incident is truly related to the continuation of China's five thousand years of history, a critical juncture for the survival of the Republic of China, and a distinction between the high and low character of the Chinese nation. Today, you both have prioritized the overall situation of the country and resolved to send me back to Nanjing. You no longer force me to sign any documents or issue any orders that are not my responsibility, nor do you have any special requests. This is not only a good opportunity for the Republic of China to turn danger into safety, but also a noble manifestation of the character and culture of the Chinese nation. China has always considered admitting mistakes and correcting them to be the mark of a gentleman. The fact that this incident has this result is due to your courage to correct your mistakes, which will add infinite light to the future of our nation. With your character and spirit, you can be moved by my spirit this time, and you are worthy of being my subordinates. The response you have received is so rapid, so other people can know even more. In the past, you were incited by the reactionaries, thinking that I treated people unfairly or was insincere to the revolution. Now, my diary from the past year, about 60,000 words, and my official and private telegrams and handwritten drafts from the past two months, are no less than 40,000 to 50,000 words. In addition, there are various national salvation plans, and various policies and programs for domestic affairs, diplomacy, military affairs, finance, education, etc., totaling no less than 100,000 words. You have all seen them. In these more than 100,000 words, you must have reviewed them in detail. Is there a single word or phrase in them that is not for the sake of the country but for selfish reasons? Is there a single bit of insincerity or dishonesty, or self-deception? Since I started schools and led troops, I have always taught people with two sentences when speaking to my subordinates and students. You must have heard of them as well. These two sentences are: (1) If I have the slightest selfishness and do not have the heart for the country and the people, then no matter who it is, they can regard me as a sinner of the country, and anyone can kill me. (2) If my words and deeds are slightly insincere, dishonest, or deceptive, and not for the sake of the revolution and the principles, then any subordinate can regard me as an enemy, and they can kill me at any time. These two sentences are what I usually use to teach my subordinates. Now, my diary and telegrams are all in your hands. Is it possible to find a single word or phrase in them that is sufficient to be evidence of my revolutionary crimes? If there is, then I am still in Xi'an at this moment, and you can still follow the words I have instructed and execute me by shooting. I am even more convinced today that what I usually teach people can be put into practice, and I feel no shame whether I am dealing with superiors or subordinates. As for the responsibility for this incident, of course, you two should bear the responsibility, but in investigating the cause, I myself should also be responsible. I have always been single-minded in serving the country, and I always thought that sincerity and instructions could be instilled in my subordinates. I have never valued my personal safety, and my precautions have been too inadequate. My daily life and actions have been too simple, too easy, and too negligent, which has caused the reactionaries to incite the army to take advantage of the opportunity to plot harm. Everything in the world has a cause. The cause of this incident was my own negligence, which led to such an act of destroying the law and discipline, causing worry and labor to the central government, unrest to the people, and losses to the country. I ask myself and find that I have nothing to say to the Party and the country, nothing to say to the people, and I cannot help but apologize to the Central Government and the people. You must know that the country cannot be without laws and discipline. You two are generals who directly lead troops, and of course you should be responsible and listen to the Central Government's decision. However, I have clearly understood that you were indeed influenced by the propaganda of the reactionaries, mistaking my sincerity for malice, and made this extraordinary upheaval. At the beginning of the incident, you already recognized that it was a reckless act that would bring disaster to the country, and expressed deep repentance. Now you both know that you have been deceived by the reactionaries, know that I not only have no malice towards you, but also have always cared for you, and have already realized this and are willing to send me back to Nanjing. I have always taught my troops that if subordinates are not good, it is because superiors are not good. To punish subordinates, superiors should be punished first. As the commander-in-chief, my education has been poor, causing my subordinates to commit this act of contempt for the law and destruction of discipline. I should of course be responsible first, apologize to the Central Government, and present your repentance to the Central Government. You have realized this early, and the incident has been spared from being prolonged and expanded. The Central Government will be able to be exceptionally generous. You should tell your subordinates about the experience of being incited by the reactionaries in this incident, as well as my attitude of only knowing the country and not knowing anything else, and earnestly comfort them so that they will not be panicked by the Central Government's handling of the matter. I usually teach people to be clear about etiquette, know shame, take responsibility, and abide by discipline. If superiors fail to teach and lead their subordinates, they should be responsible. Therefore, I am willing to take responsibility in this incident as a superior. You should listen to the Central Government's decision, and your subordinates should not be panicked. We should always regard the survival of the country as above all else, and should recognize that the country must survive and that personal considerations are insignificant. We must know that personal character must be preserved, and only then will the nation have a foundation. Therefore, our lives can be sacrificed, but the laws and disciplines of the country cannot be compromised. The body can be bound, but the freedom of the spirit must never be bound. I will never dare to shirk or abandon my responsibility to the Central Government and the country as long as I have a breath left. You have repeatedly asked me to sign and issue orders, but I have always refused, because personal character is more important than life and death. My words and deeds should not only be passed down to future generations, but also to show you by example so that you also know that the importance of personal character is greater than everything else. I said repeatedly at the time that if I were in Xi'an and allowed you to sign a single word to your demands, the country would be as good as destroyed. Because I represent the character of the 400 million people of the Republic of China, if I were to be intimidated by the power of my subordinates and seek to avoid danger, then my personal character would be swept away, which is equivalent to the character of the Chinese nation being swept away. Whether it is an individual or a country and nation, if personal character is lost, then even if they are alive, they are as good as dead, and even if they exist, they will surely perish. I usually proclaim to the people the four words of being clear about etiquette, knowing shame, taking responsibility, and abiding by discipline, regarding them as the only way to save the country. Of course, I should not hesitate to make any sacrifices to maintain personal character and promote righteousness, and I must not act contrary to my words, leaving my subordinates and the people at a loss and plunging the country into destruction. Since this incident, you should have learned a definite lesson. You must know that personal character is more important than everything else, the interests of the country are more important than everything else, mistakes should be admitted frankly, faults should be sincerely repented, and responsibilities should be clearly borne, and you should tell your subordinates this idea as well. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once instructed us that we must restore national morality in order to save the nation. The so-called trustworthiness, righteousness, peace are all essential virtues of the nation. What I have devoted myself to for more than ten years is to unite the spirit and unify the country to save the country, and especially to emphasize trustworthiness. What I have always encouraged myself with are the two words: " 言必信、行必果" *words must be kept, actions must be decisive*. For anything that benefits the country and the nation, I will never have the slightest selfishness, and there is nothing that cannot be adopted or implemented. The policies and guidelines of the Central Government in recent years have also been focused on peaceful reunification, cultivating national strength, uniting the people's hearts, and unwilling to damage the strength of the nation. Therefore, in this incident, if you detain me in Xi'an, then the responsibility for causing war should be borne by your actions of destroying discipline. Now that you have expressed remorse, I can request the Central Government to continue to uphold the spirit of cherishing national strength and have appropriate arrangements to save the crisis of the country. In short, you have now understood the current situation of the country and my painstaking efforts to save the country. In my life, I have always taken the survival of the country and the success or failure of the revolution as the premise, and never considered personal grievances, let alone any thoughts of life, death, interests, or losses. Moreover, I have personally received Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings of broad-mindedness and kindness, and have always used love and sincerity as the way to deal with people, and never pursued things excessively. The speed at which you have repented this time shows that you still know to prioritize the country. In that case, you should absolutely obey the orders of the Central Government, and everything should follow the decisions of the Central Government, and jointly save our precarious national fortune. This is the way to turn misfortune into blessing." (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>America and Japan Purchase Old Cotton in Large Quantities in Hong Kong, Causing the Poor to Lament Their Lack of Warm Clothing</h3>
<p>Hong Kong dispatch: Wadded cotton and cotton wadding in Guangdong and Hong Kong have always been essential items for the lower classes to keep warm. This is because they are affordable and within the economic means of these people. However, since the beginning of winter this year, the prices of old cotton clothing and wadding in Hong Kong and Guangdong have not only skyrocketed, but supplies have also dwindled, with demand exceeding supply. The reason for this is that the United States and Japan have recently been purchasing large quantities of old cotton in Guangdong and Hong Kong to ship back to their home countries. This has led some merchants to dismantle old cotton clothing and wadding to extract the cotton to meet this demand, as this is more profitable. As a result, old cotton clothing and wadding have become scarce, and prices have soared, causing the lower classes to lament their lack of warm clothing.</p>

<h3>Favorable Developments in European Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Since the signing of the Anglo-Italian Gentleman's Agreement regarding the Mediterranean last week, a similar agreement has also been reached between France and Italy. The tense atmosphere in the Mediterranean over the past year has surprisingly shown gradual improvement towards the end of the year. This improvement has now produced concrete results: Italy has changed its attitude towards the non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, ceasing its support for the rebel forces in Spain. As for Germany, which continues its active intervention, it has been jointly advised by Britain and France.</p>
<p>This joint British and French stance on the issue of non-intervention in Spain is important not only for addressing the Spanish situation itself but also for the genuine cooperation between these two countries in diplomacy. Over the past year, Britain and France have consistently appeared to be cooperating superficially but not genuinely on many important European issues. For example, France's attitude towards the Italian-Abyssinian issue was not as firm as Britain's, and Britain's attitude towards the Locarno issue was not as concerned as France's. This inconsistency in attitudes has actually been the cause of many European crises over the past year. However, in the past month or two, France has clearly been helping Britain in its negotiations with Italy. And in dealing with the Spanish issue, France has consistently adhered to a common stance with Britain. This diplomatic strategy has now achieved considerable success. Therefore, after the signing of the Gentleman's Agreement on the Mediterranean, Britain and France simultaneously issued warnings to Germany regarding its intervention in the Spanish Civil War. And such a joint warning is, in fact, equivalent to a very strong warning.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the diplomacy of the current French Popular Front government is clearly more successful than that of the Laval era. From Germany's announcement of its rearmament last year to its advance into the Rhineland this year, it has been the weakest period for French diplomatic power since the war. This time, French Foreign Minister Delbos's talks with the German ambassador have given a fairly tough warning regarding Germany's support for the Spanish rebels. This relatively forceful expression should be the prelude to France gradually restoring its original diplomatic position. Upon closer examination of Léon Blum's foreign policy, it seems that his approach is very good. On the one hand, he fully trusts the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact. On the other hand, he also insists on not abandoning cooperation with Britain. He even tries to maintain a compromise with Italy, whose policies contain some contradictions with French policies. In addition to seeking to further strengthen France's relations with the Little Entente countries, he also strives to restore the old friendship between Poland, which has been relatively estranged in recent years, and France. This diplomatic strategy has one central goal: to prevent the aggression of Germany, France's greatest enemy. The general development of the European diplomatic situation now proves that Léon Blum's diplomatic efforts have been somewhat able to achieve his goal.</p>

<p>(Paris) This year, during the Christmas holiday, residents of the capital flocked to the mountains for winter sports.

Yesterday, passenger trains departed from various stations in the capital every three and a half minutes. Most passengers were traveling in groups, carrying skiing equipment, climbing into the carriages, jostling to get ahead. All seats on every train, from the most luxurious sleeping cars to third-class carriages, were fully booked more than ten days in advance. As for the streets near the stations, taxis were lined up in three rows, with dozens running. Passengers, fearing they would miss their trains, urged the drivers to honk their horns, the sound deafening. These passengers all carried skiing equipment, placed on top of the cars, as dense as a forest. This was truly a spectacular sight unprecedented in previous years. (December 25, Havas)</p>
<p>(Rome) Last year, during Christmas, it was shortly after the start of the Italian-Abyssinian War, and when various countries implemented sanctions against Italy, all celebrations were suspended.

<h3>Soldiers on the Spanish Front Do Not Forget Christmas; Rebel Artillery and Aircraft Bomb the Capital; Great Panic Among Pedestrians in the Streets of Madrid</h3>
<p>Madrid: The government army and militia today granted a rebel army officer permission to cross the "no man's land" between the two armies to spend Christmas with his family in the suburbs. (December 25, National Telegraph)</p>
<p>Avila: Yesterday was Christmas Day. The Carlist soldiers belonging to the Nationalist militia in the Guadarrama Mountains north of Madrid celebrated the holiday in their military quarters. The terrain there is high, 1,500 meters above sea level, surrounded by huge pine trees covered with snow. The soldiers sat on the ground, each bringing out food sent by relatives and the public, such as ham, sausages, poultry, cakes, and wine, scattered all over the ground, sitting around eating heartily. The army had no kitchen equipment, so they roasted turkeys on bayonets and then ate them. Candles were placed nearby, and pine needles were scattered above. In this solemn environment, they spent the holiday peacefully, while reconnaissance teams remained on guard at the front lines. (December 26, Havas)</p>
<p>Madrid: Today is Christmas Day. Nationalist artillery units heavily shelled Madrid amidst the ringing of church bells. At least 20 artillery shells landed near the telephone bureau, and many shells also landed in the Gran Vía area. Fires broke out in several places, and the sound of sirens filled the air as fire trucks rushed through the streets to put out the fires. Although several Nationalist artillery shells hit the telephone bureau, none of the staff inside were injured. (December 25, National Telegraph)</p>
<p>Madrid: Although today is Christmas Day, Nationalist forces continued to shell the capital for an hour. The main targets of the shelling were the Central Telephone Company building and the Stock Exchange. Both places were hit, with no fewer than thirty shells landing. Fortunately, the number of casualties was not very high. The first few shells landed on Gran Vía Avenue at 4 PM. The glass windows of several cafes were shattered. The weather was mild at the time, and there were many pedestrians on the street. When the shells landed, the crowd panicked and fled to the subway and the corridors of private residences. Women clutched babies in their arms, not knowing what to do. Several militiamen immediately rushed to the scene to restore order, ordering the crowd to evacuate to neighboring streets and protecting the area near the Central Telephone Company and the Stock Exchange. At 4:20 PM, a fire broke out on the upper floor of the Central Telephone Company building. Staff inside immediately extinguished the fire with fire extinguishers. Soon, firefighters arrived and put out the fire in a quarter of an hour. Several special correspondents from this newspaper were gathering inside the Central Telephone Company building at the time, conducting their daily interviews, and witnessed the situation. By 5 PM, the fire was completely extinguished. The facades of the Telephone Company and the Stock Exchange were destroyed by the fire, but telegraph and telephone communications with the rest of the world had not been interrupted. According to the latest news, three women and two men were killed and seriously injured in the incident. There were several interesting anecdotes during the incident. When the Telephone Company caught fire, a servant calmly washed the marble steps in front of the building, as if thinking that the steps had been trampled by firefighters and had to be cleaned immediately, while the sound of artillery fire outside was ignored. In the telephone switchboard room, a female telephone operator did not immediately evacuate to a safe place after hearing the alarm, but insisted on asking the manager for a pencil. The manager replied, "Forget it." Such anecdotes are common in the most serious incidents. (December 25, Havas)</p>
<p>Madrid: Although yesterday was Christmas Day, several Nationalist aircraft bombed the city again at 11 PM, dropping many bombs on the outskirts of the capital.

(December 25, Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) Bertin, a famous reporter for the Paris Echo, recently stated that the attitude that the British and French governments should take towards Germany is to issue a statement to Berlin stating that "Germany's current policy of self-sufficiency is a reckless move. Its four-year plan must be abandoned, and it must work with us to allow Germany to rejoin the international community where capital, commerce, and services are connected. Germany's gold reserves are exhausted, and its deposits are also lacking. We will remedy this. We will also facilitate Germany's access to colonial raw materials needed by German producers, just as we do. We may go further and give Germany land outside of Europe, but with one condition: that we sincerely hope that Germany's current policies can be fundamentally changed and no longer openly prepare for aggression. On the contrary, provide concrete guarantees to show its determination to abide by international law." Bertin then concluded, "If Germany's self-sufficiency policy is to be eased, then Germany's socialist system may be weakened or even overturned." The Communist Party's newspaper "L'Humanité" stated, "Can Germany obtain colonies?" This is not impossible, but Germany must cease its intervention in the Spanish Civil War and not use this as an exchange condition. Can we say to German leader Hitler, "If you abandon your policy of intervening in the Spanish Civil War, we will give you colonies?" (December 26, Havas)</p>
<h3>Germany Deploys Military Forces on the Swiss Border; Report by a French Reporter</h3>
<p>(Paris) Boursier, a famous reporter for L'Intransigeant, recently described the military preparations being carried out by Germany in areas adjacent to the Swiss border, as well as the Swiss government's response. He stated that the holidays for the German National Defense Force and the Labor Service Corps during Christmas and New Year's have been canceled. Since the 13th of this month, members of the National Socialist Storm Troopers and the SS have been carrying machine guns and cannons, traveling by car to station themselves in the area of Lörrach in the southwestern border region, which is only seven kilometers away from Basel, Switzerland. "The railway from Stuttgart to Friedrichshafen, which originally passed through Basel, Switzerland, has now been rebuilt within the country, only five kilometers from Basel. A cave has been built on the shores of Lake Constance, fully loaded with bullets and explosives. All of this is due to the efforts of the Storm Troopers and the SS." The Swiss government feels threatened by this move by Germany and has begun preparations to respond. On the 4th of this month, a new company of volunteers was formed, consisting of engineers and unemployed workers from the reserve army, and is scheduled to be stationed in the city of Porrentruy in the north (twenty kilometers from the Jura region). The General Staff has also taken various measures to prepare to quickly form several volunteer teams. "In addition, all active-duty soldiers of the Swiss Army have been building trenches and fortifications along the Rhine River between Basel and Schaffhausen since the 21st of this month, but so far, nothing has been leaked to the outside world."

These will be established as national policies, and their realization will be ensured. Therefore, when compiling the budget for 1937, the necessary expenses must be concentrated on the execution of important military and national policies. At the same time, efforts must be made to increase ordinary revenue in order to consolidate the foundation of finances. This is the policy adopted for this budget compilation."

<h3>Political Tide in Cuba</h3>
<p>Havana, Cuba After former President Gomez was removed from office by a special tribunal of the Senate, Vice President Laredo Bru legally succeeded him. Political figures have recently stated that Army Chief of Staff Colonel Batista may force Laredo Bru to resign in the coming week. (25th Havas News)</p>
<p>Havana, Cuba The rumor that Army Chief of Staff Colonel Batista will force the new President Laredo Bru to resign has been denied by those around the Colonel. However, the majority of members of Congress still say a political storm is about to break out, and Cuba will soon establish a military dictatorship. According to the constitution, if the new president does resign, then the Prime Minister, General Montalvo, a confidant of Colonel Batista, will succeed as president. Political figures say that when former President Gomez left office, he issued a declaration accusing Colonel Batista of harboring dictatorial ambitions, which he directly admitted. Colonel Batista will surely respond to this. Yesterday, it was heard that he had a two-hour meeting with the new President Laredo Bru, but the contents of the conversation were not disclosed. In addition, after the new president took office, he sent a telegram to Colonel Batista saying, "I greatly admire Your Excellency, and I especially admire the army led by Your Excellency, which is capable of guiding Cuba into an increasingly powerful realm." Colonel Batista replied with a telegram saying, "The army will always support Your Excellency's policy plans. This is what I can guarantee to Your Excellency. On the occasion of Christmas, I wish Your Excellency success and Cuba success." Furthermore, a political friend of former President Gomez recently stated that after the government banned the publication of the former president's declaration in newspapers, two million copies have been printed and distributed to the people of the country.

<h3>Famous American Reporter Brisbane Passes Away with an Annual Salary of $250,000</h3>
<p>(New York) Hearst newspaper reporter Brisbane passed away here at 5:30 this morning due to heart disease. Brisbane was involved in the newspaper business for 53 years. (25th National News)</p>
<p>(New York) Famous American journalist Arthur Brisbane died here today at the age of 72. Brisbane received an annual salary of $250,000 from the Hearst newspapers, and his writings were read by three to four million people. He opened a column called "Today" in two hundred newspapers, commenting on current events with a short and witty style. The writing was simple but flavorful, and it was published daily without interruption, making newspaper readers addicted to it. He also opened a column called "This Week" in 1,200 weekly magazines, chatting with rural people. Each Hearst weekly used large fonts to publish his full-page criticisms. Although unsigned, readers knew it was written by Brisbane. Brisbane was good at describing details to move the majority of readers. For example, on Washington's birthday, he discussed the size of the first president's feet, which was interesting and made readers reluctant to put it down. Brisbane returned to the country after studying in France and Germany for five years and served at the New York Sun. He was only 19 years old at the time. He later served as the chief editor of the New York World for seven years. In 1897, the circulation of the New York Evening Journal was only 40,000 copies, and it was on the verge of collapse. Brisbane was confident that he could increase the newspaper's circulation and save it, so he gave up his annual salary of $15,000 from the World and took the job at the Evening Journal with an annual salary of $7,500 to try his hand. Brisbane joined the Evening Journal in less than four months, and the circulation increased sharply because the editorials he wrote attracted readers. His contract with Hearst stipulated that his salary would increase according to the increase in the newspaper's circulation, so Brisbane's annual salary increased greatly, and he gained both fame and fortune. Brisbane had a very quick mind. He could dictate 1,200 to 1,500 words in 30 minutes. Brisbane set up an office in New York. When he crossed the Hudson River to return home every day, he always took a secretary with him and revised his articles on the ferry. Once, because he wanted to travel, he drafted 39 editorials in three hours so that the Evening Journal could use them before he returned. When Brisbane traveled, whether by boat or car, he always took a secretary and a typewriter. Even in the car, he dictated the text, and his secretary recorded it on the typewriter. On the train, he often used the sleeping car as an office. The Pullman train company always prepared the latest newspapers published in the area Brisbane passed through at the station and gave them to him when he arrived for him to use as source material.

<h3>Japan Controls Military Industrial Production Expansion of Private Military Industry, Improvement of Production Each Factory Subject to Guidance and Supervision by the Military Department Naval and Army Arsenal Workers Reach 100,000</h3>
<p>Tokyo Special Dispatch, The most noteworthy facility in Japan currently, which our country's citizens should pay attention to, is its control of military industrial production. This year's military budget is about 1.4 billion yuan, an increase of 340 million yuan compared to this year. The Army's six-year, 3.2 billion plan, (starting next year) and the Navy Department's third supplementary plan, show the new trend of Japan's expanding military spending. Therefore, military industrial production is also expanding accordingly. In Japan's military industrial production, state-owned enterprises account for a minority, and most rely on private industry. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Private Industry</p>
<p>According to the Army Ministry's investigation, from Showa 6 (1931) to Showa 10, the total amount of military supplies expenses for these five years was 1.066 billion yuan, of which 785 million yuan was invested in private industry. In Showa 10, 68% of the Navy's military supplies were supplied by private industry. From this, we can see the relationship between private industry and military industrial production. After the expansion of military spending, it is absolutely necessary to strengthen the control of private military industry, such as expanding the capacity of private military industry, preventing price increases, suppressing high interest rates, controlling the connection between large capital industries and small and medium-sized industries, improving production technology and equipment, protecting secrets, and speeding up wartime merit awarding. All these issues are very necessary for controlling private military industrial production. The Japanese military is currently carefully considering strengthening military industrial production.</p>
<p>Current Control Situation</p>
<p>Japan's policy of controlling military industrial production has long existed. The Military Industry Mobilization Law formulated in Taisho 7 was the earliest control law. This was the result of the direct stimulation of the World War and the birth of the Soviet Union. However, it was only a law, and the enforcement regulations and implementation details were never announced. Although the Military Industry Control Law has not been implemented, there has been control in fact. (1) The Petroleum Industry Law forces petroleum companies to have oil storage obligations to protect domestic oil refining industry as its policy. (2) The Automobile Industry Law aims to develop domestic automobiles. These two laws both contain the meaning of business license control. At the same time, the government uses its power to strongly intervene in business plans to achieve the effect of control. On the surface, it is an ordinary economic control, but in fact, it mainly focuses on strengthening direct military industrial production. The currently proposed electricity control problem has gained strong support from the military because it indirectly contains the meaning of controlling military industrial production. In order to adapt to the expanding naval budget, the Ministry of Communications actively controls the shipbuilding industry and is currently reforming the Shipbuilding Industry Law. As for those that achieve control effectiveness without according to laws, on the Army's side, there are Japan Steel Works, Oshima Steel Works, Tengcang Factory, Sumitomo Copper Rolling, Japan Musical Instruments, Automobile Manufacturing, Nanbu Arsenal, Ishikawa Island Aircraft, Japan Vehicle, Automobile Industry, Hitachi Manufacturing, Domestic Industry, etc. On the Navy's side, there are Japan Battery, Mitsubishi Electric, Fujinagata Shipbuilding, Showa Production, Ishikawa Island Shipbuilding, Osaka Iron Works, Kawanishi Aircraft, Japan Wool Textile, Japan Fireworks, Japan Electric Industry, Teikoku Hemp Manufacturing, Japan Seiko, Kobukuro Workshop, Aichi Clock, etc. For both the Army and Navy, there are Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Tokyo Instruments, Nippon Kogaku, Tokyo Gas Electric Industry, Kawasaki Shipbuilding, Nakajima Aircraft, Dangshi Electric, etc. Each factory is subject to the military's control, has the obligation to strictly maintain secrecy, and is subject to strict intervention and supervision regarding equipment capacity and the quality of manufactured goods.</p>
<p>Future Trends</p>
<p>In Showa 7, the Japanese Army Arsenal had 13,000 workers, and the Navy Arsenal had 38,000. Currently, the Army's ordinary workers and temporary workers have reached 32,000, and the Navy has expanded to 79,000, totaling 100,000. Although Japan's state-owned military industry is large-scale, it still cannot complete the task of expanding military spending next year. In the future, it will strive to guide the expansion of private productivity and strive to study how peacetime industrial production equipment can be converted into wartime military industrial factories. This point is similar to the situation in Germany on the eve of the European War, which is very noteworthy. (20th)</p>
<h3>Last Month's Northeast Special Products Statistics on Exports from Dalian Soybean Oil and Sorghum Decline, Soybeans and Soybean Cakes Increase</h3>

Compared with the same month last year, soybeans increased by 61,800 tons, soybean cakes increased by 6,600 tons, soybean oil decreased by 2,200 tons, and sorghum decreased by 380 tons. The export to Europe increased by 54,000 tons of soybeans, almost doubling. However, the last year's relationship with "water soybeans" caused a big reduction. This year, exports to Europe are usually 120,000. The same is true for soybean cakes. Exports to Japan increased by 4,500 tons, and the United States increased by 3,100 tons. Soybean oil is the opposite. Europe decreased by 2,500 tons, and China decreased by 280 tons. Sorghum exports to Japan decreased by 388 tons, which may be due to the high price of raw materials. The statistics of exports to various places are compared with the same month last year and listed on the left. (Unit: tons)</p>

<h3>Xiamen Customs Cracks Down on Taiwanese Sailing Vessels Returning Home Strictly Preventing Smuggling and Importation of Contraband Goods Guangdong and Hong Kong Will Jointly Fight Smuggling</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence Smuggling into Fujian Province is mostly done by sailing vessels from Taiwan, which unload goods at various coastal ports in Quanzhou and Zhangzhou. Taiwan is separated from the southern Fujian coast by a strait, and the narrowest point is only 70 miles, which can be reached by sailing. However, if they can break through the patrol line of the customs inspection ships and reach the coast of Fujian Province, they can unload smuggled goods without hindrance. Therefore, the Xiamen Customs is extremely strict in inspecting civilian ships. On the 23rd of this month, a notice was issued, which stated, "It has been found that civilian ships returning to China from Taiwan must report to the Daguan Yinao Branch or Dongshan Branch for verification in accordance with the current regulations. Now, in order to facilitate the navigation of civilian ships from Taiwan to northern Fujian and the coastal areas of Zhejiang, it is stipulated that from January 1, 1937, all civilian ships that clear customs to any place and sail to places north of Beijiao in Fujian Province may directly sail to the Dongchong Branch of the Fuhai Customs (Sandu Ao) for verification. However, before leaving Taiwan, the civilian ship must first submit to the Chinese Consul-General in Taipei to stamp the ship's registration book. If the civilian ship does not have the registration book stamped by the Chinese Consul in Taipei and directly sails to the Dongchong Branch for verification, it will be considered smuggling, and the shipowner or captain will be punished in accordance with the revised regulations on the management of navigation and shipping of civilian ships by the customs. As for civilian ships clearing customs in Taiwan and sailing to places south of Jiaobei, they must still follow the current regulations and report to the Guanyin Ao Branch or Dongshan Branch for verification."</p>
<p>It is also heard that smugglers have recently secretly established smuggling cooperatives in various parts of Fujian and Guangdong to contact each other. Currently, many private merchants carry goods on each ship exporting from Hong Kong and smuggle them ashore in Shantou, Xiamen, or Fuzhou to evade taxes. There are countless tricks, and it is not easy to crack down on them. According to Xiamen Customs, the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance has not only ordered the Shantou, Xiamen, and Fuzhou customs to crack down on smuggling, but has also negotiated with the Hong Kong government on joint smuggling prevention measures. The Hong Kong government has agreed to strictly inspect smuggling from Hong Kong, which should make smugglers restrain themselves. (December 25th)</p>
<h3>Rampant Bandits in the Suburbs of Guangzhou Bridges on the Luogangdong Highway Burned Down Sugar Cane Field in Chebei Sugar Factory Looted</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence, In recent years, various parts of Guangdong Province have seen increasing rural bankruptcies and unemployment. Desperate and strong people who lack food and clothing are forced to take risks. In addition, the weather is cold at the end of the year, and unruly people are even more rampant. Robbery cases in villages and towns are frequent. The previous week, an incident was discovered in Luogangdong, a northeast suburb, where bandits burned down bridges on the Luogang highway. Luogangdong is only a dozen miles away from Guangzhou, and there is a lot of car and truck traffic every day. Luogangdong is one of the famous scenic spots in the suburbs. There is the Luofeng Temple there, and in winter, the plum trees bloom, and the color of the plum blossoms can be seen within 20 miles. Ladies and gentlemen who踏雪寻梅 leave many footprints. In summer, it is famous for producing fragrant lychees. A few years ago, the authorities designated several villages in the area as pilot areas for compulsory education and established compulsory primary schools. There is also a vegetable exhibition and the awarding of agricultural production certificates every year, so Luogangdong has gradually become a prosperous area. Bandits take advantage of this to covet the merchants and passengers who come and go, destroying bridges to rob vehicles. Fortunately, it was discovered early. The authorities have ordered the Panyu County government to instruct local gentry to investigate the bandits and strictly protect travelers. In addition, the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is not far from the east of the city, and there is a station called Chebei, which is adjacent to Luogangdong. In the Yonghewei Village of Chebei near the station, there is a sugar cane field of the provincial sugar factory. There are employees inside who work every day and live in peace with each other. Unexpectedly, at about 1:00 a.m. on the 19th, many bandits suddenly rushed into the factory, threatened the employees with guns and prohibited them from shouting. At the same time, several bandits looted all the silver, clothing, and bedding stored in the field. The employees then reported the case to the nearby Chebei Commune and the Dongpu Police Branch and reported the robbery to the provincial sugar factory, requesting that the local authorities be instructed to arrest the bandits and investigate the case. In addition to ordering the Panyu County government to investigate the case, the authorities have been strictly guarding against traffic in the near suburbs of the city and the city itself in recent days. Yesterday, military police were sent out to set up temporary inspection posts in the suburbs.

<h3>Kunshan: Planning to Re-investigate Opium Addicts</h3>
<p>The county's general re-investigation of opium addicts is scheduled to begin on New Year's Day next year. A large number of propaganda materials have been printed and dispatched to villages to urge opium addicts to surrender themselves.

<h3>Suzhou: County Magistrate Deng Resigns Twice</h3>
<p>Since taking office, Wu County Magistrate Deng Xianghai has not been in office for even a year. Due to various reasons and the difficulty in handling affairs, he has taken a passive attitude and has twice returned to the Civil Affairs Department to request resignation in order to relieve his responsibilities. Commissioner Yu earnestly persuaded him to stay and encouraged him to face the serious situation, so Deng has dismissed the idea of resigning.</p>
<h3>Another Trafficking Organization Cracked</h3>
<p>The garrisoned gendarmes in Suzhou recently seized two drug cases in a row at the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Station. One case involved more than ninety catties of red pills, and the other involved twenty-nine kilograms of opium. Two opium traffickers, Qian Sen and others, were also arrested and sent to the Military Police Investigation Office. They are currently being interrogated and may be sent to the Commissioner's Office for trial. Also, at around 8:00 PM on the 25th, police officers from the Sixth Section of the Second Public Security Bureau raided Zhang Peizhi's home in Tianxian Lane, Siqian Street, and seized three catties and four taels of smuggled opium.

Onlookers were like walls, and everyone was vigilant. In advance, the county issued dozens of plain wooden coffins, which were parked at various city gate intersections, with strips of white paper pasted on them, reading "Opium addicts who do not surrender will enter here." The parade gathered at the public stadium, circled around the streets, and then dispersed at the stadium.</p>

<h3>Gaoyou: Freezing Temperatures</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of winter in this county, it has not been severely cold. After a sudden shift to extreme cold following northwest winds, water has been freezing since the 23rd. Rivers and ports have also begun to freeze. The thermometer has dropped to 26 degrees Fahrenheit. One male beggar, in his forties, has already frozen to death in the eastern countryside.</p>
<h3>Haizhou: Security Team Confiscates Civilian Guns</h3>
<p>Chang Chunqing, the leader of the Second Squad of the Third Company of the Thirty-first Security Brigade stationed in Lianshui, led a plainclothes team of more than 30 people to the townships of the Second District, Longju, in the East China Sea the other day to confiscate dozens of civilian guns, causing panic and unease. Local responsible persons have repeatedly negotiated without success. Li Shoutong, the district chief of the district, telegraphed the county government yesterday to find a way to stop it.</p>

<p>The county government, in view of the winter defense period, urgently needs to arrange things properly. It has ordered the subordinate public security agencies to comply with the winter defense.

<h3>Municipal Bureau of Public Works: Completion of Shanghai South No. 1 Warehouse, Leased to Minsheng Company for Exclusive Use for Ten Years, Tea Reception Yesterday to Invite People from All Walks of Life to Visit</h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau's Shanghai South No. 1 Warehouse, located in front of the Maojia Lane intersection on the outer road in Nanshi, is magnificent in construction and novel in equipment. Construction began in May of this year and was completed in seven months. It has been leased to Minsheng Industrial Company for exclusive use for ten years. A completion ceremony was held yesterday, inviting people from all walks of life to visit. Director Xu Peihuang of the bureau reported on the construction process. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tea Reception: The municipal warehouse is a five-story long building, horizontally erected in front of the Nanshi Outer Road, behind Pier No. 11 on the Pujiang Riverside Road. The entire building is white with steel windows, neat and magnificent, making it a major building in Shanghai South. Yesterday, a completion ceremony was held. More than a hundred people from all walks of life were invited to visit, including Yu Qiaqing, Gu Xinyi, Lin Jinyu, Zhang Shulin, and Tan Boying. They were greeted by staff and toured the rooms. Tea and refreshments were served on the third floor. During the reception, Xu Peihuang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, reported on the construction of the warehouse. This was followed by a speech by Yu Qiaqing, a senior figure in the shipping industry, who stated that he was delighted that the municipal authorities and shipping merchants had cooperated to complete this new type of warehouse. He recalled that when Zhang Yuejun was in charge of Shanghai, he had offered advice to have the city government organize and sub-lease the piers of the Shiliupu to various shipping companies, which was adopted. The situation is now well-organized. This time, Minsheng Industrial Company and the municipal government have completed the construction of the warehouse, and the facilities are even more perfect. He hoped that other companies could also cooperate in construction to facilitate shipping and develop industry and commerce. Next, Zhang Shulin, Manager of Minsheng Industrial Company, gave a speech. He said that Minsheng Company has a relatively short history, having only established a branch in Shanghai for five years. Previously, the lack of a pier caused inconvenience for both passengers and cargo. A few years ago, the Public Works Bureau approved the lease of Piers No. 11 and 12. Now, the Public Works Bureau has built a new warehouse, leased to the company for exclusive use for ten years, with perfect facilities, and the company will work harder to provide services. It is said that the construction cost of the warehouse was about 210,000 yuan, and it will be managed by the Public Works Bureau Pier Warehouse Management Committee and will be put into use on New Year's Day next year.</p>
<p>Warehouse Facilities: The warehouse base covers an area of 1.588 acres, forming a narrow and long shape. The length from north to south is 90.49 meters (296 feet 10 inches), the width at the north end is 8.5 meters (28 feet), and the width at the south end is 16.95 meters (55 feet 7 inches). The area is 1,078 square meters (11,600 square feet). The internal layout of the first floor includes the customs office, private goods storage room, inspection room, Minsheng Company manager's office, office reception room, warehouse, management room, washroom, crane room, elevator room, and storage room. The second, third, fourth, and fifth floors are all storage rooms. The total net storage area inside the warehouse is 3,927.5 square meters (42,260 square feet), and the net open-air storage area on the roof is 870 square meters (9,370 square feet). Therefore, the storage capacity of the municipal warehouse is more than 5,000 tons. The height of the building, from the first floor to the roof, is 18.6 meters (61 feet). The first floor is 0.61 meters (2 feet) above the road surface, so that goods inside will not be wet when the tide rises. The project and materials strive for solidity. All columns, beams, foundations, roofs, stairs, and floor slabs are made of steel and concrete to ensure durability and fire resistance. The foundation piles are all made of round wooden piles of 18.29 meters (60 feet) and 21.34 meters (70 feet) in length. The warehouse site was formed by filling with soil by the Dredging Bureau, and it has only been twenty years. The soil is loose and cannot bear heavy loads, so it is necessary to drive long piles to achieve solidity. In addition, underground beams are built on top of the wooden piles to quickly connect all the piles. In this way, even if the house subsides, it will be a complete and even drop, without unevenness or cracks. Internal equipment pays the most attention to facilitating the loading and unloading of goods and preventing fires. There are three types of equipment to facilitate the loading and unloading of goods: one is an escalator, with a gentle slope for easy walking; the second is an elevator, with two elevators, each with a load capacity of 1.996 kilograms (2 tons, i.e., 4,400 pounds) and a speed of 35 meters per minute; the third is a unloading machine, also known as a crane, with two cranes installed on the fifth floor for unloading. The load capacity is 762 kilograms (3/4 ton, i.e., 1,680 pounds). All operations are done manually. The manufacturing cost is low, and its application in domestic warehouses is still a pioneering effort. The crane room is equipped with sliding doors, and cargo trucks can drive in from the road and load and unload goods indoors, so even on rainy days, the goods will not be wet. As for fire prevention design, it is even more meticulous. The warehouse building frame is made of steel and concrete, and the brick walls are covered with cement and yellow sand, so there is no risk of fire. In the escalator office, all doorways connecting to the storage area are equipped with fire doors. In case of an accident, the fire doors can close automatically to prevent the spread of fire. There are also five fire escape ladders around the building, and each floor is equipped with a fire platform so that firefighters can climb onto the platform to rescue in case of a fire. In addition, there are two types of fire fighting equipment: one is a fire hydrant system, with one fire hydrant in each storage area, equipped with various accessories such as fire hoses. In case of a fire, the fire hose is connected to the hydrant, and water can be released for rescue. The second is an automatic fire extinguisher, installed under the floor slabs of each floor. Every three square meters is equipped with a fire extinguisher, shaped like a faucet, with the opening sealed with a fuse. Water will not overflow. If a fire occurs and the temperature in the room rises to 58 degrees Celsius, the fuse will melt, and water will spray outwards to extinguish the fire, which is very effective. For fire fighting water, two water tanks are placed on the roof in case the tap water supply is insufficient or the pressure is too low.</p>

<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters of this city, in order to promote the work of the district branches, has specially drafted rectification measures and issued a notice for re-registration.

<h3>For the Issue of Manufacturing and Selling Gas Masks: Unified Guidance Methods, Air Defense Association Creates Two Types of Registration Forms: Manufacturers and People Must First Fill Them Out Before Instructions Are Given</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Air Defense Association, recently in view of the fact that there are many manufacturers in this city who independently manufacture and sell gas masks, and many civilians blindly prepare them, is concerned that merchants may only be interested in profits or lack skills, inevitably cutting corners and producing shoddy products, so that the products are not enough to defend against poison gas and are difficult to ensure safety, which is very dangerous. It is also worried that allowing civilians to buy them casually will easily fall into the hands of traitors, who will turn to help bandits, which is even more harmful. Therefore, the association has issued a public notice in newspapers, calling on the people to pay attention and carefully select purchases to avoid wasting money and being deceived. On the other hand, it has also submitted a request to the highest military and political authorities for rapid control measures and the implementation of manufacturing and sales management to prevent abuses. It is said that after the news was revealed, manufacturers of gas masks and people concerned about gas prevention have flocked to the association to request instructions, and they are overwhelmed. Now, in order to seek a unified guidance method to facilitate both manufacturers and people, the association has now created a gas mask manufacturing registration form and a purchase registration form. Those who want to request instructions, such as manufacturers, must first fill out the manufacturing registration form, and people must first fill out the purchase registration form, then the association will give detailed instructions. It is also said that the forms can be obtained directly from the association or by enclosing postage.</p>

<p>Memorial Text of the Meeting</p>
<p>On December 26th, the 25th year of the Republic of China, the party, government, military, and police agencies of Shanghai, as well as various agencies, groups, and people from all walks of life, respectfully offer incense, flowers, and wine to the spirit of National Government Member Huang Yingbai, saying, Alas, recalling the past years, the country is in unprecedented difficulties. In the struggle to resist foreign aggression and revitalize the nation, you took the lead. In Zhejiang, you abandoned your pen and discussed military affairs with patriots. You secretly planned reforms and were determined to sacrifice. You first went to the East and joined the Tongmenghui with great enthusiasm. As a man of courage, you implemented your plans. In the autumn of the Xinhai Revolution, all sides were united in hatred. You and the Shanghai Governor had deep mutual understanding. You entered the command tent and took charge of the troops. You planned the advance and took charge of the strategy. You transported supplies and arms. In a few months, you recovered China. Whose merits can compare with yours? After the establishment of the Republic of China, you were humble and unpretentious. You took the lead in relinquishing your post, creating a new atmosphere. How could we have foreseen that great villains would rise up at that time, deceiving us with treachery? They harmed good people and trampled on justice. You and the Shanghai Governor resumed the righteous crusade. Heaven did not bless us, and the righteous banner suddenly fell. You traveled to the United States and Japan, determined to rebuild. The Anmin Society advocated, and the country's path shifted imperceptibly. The Southwest Protectorate was almost unsustainable. Your anger was aroused, and you quickly returned to your hometown. You supported the independence of Zhejiang Province. Before long, you raised the banner of righteousness. The country was pacified, and you did not claim credit for your achievements. You retired to Tianjin and devoted yourself to writing books. With foresight and prescience, you deeply pondered the lessons of the European War. You were determined to save the times and entered the government several times. Your grand plans and regulations are worthy of being passed down for thousands of years. The revolutionary army rose from the South. The righteous banner pointed to the hope of contact. You and Feng Yuxiang shared the same heart and mind. You secretly discussed the response to achieve penetration. The foundation in the North was thus successful. China was unified, and Nanjing was established as the capital. You continued your efforts and served as the mayor of Shanghai. You used people and administered the government with utmost impartiality. The scale and order became a national model. You then took charge of the altar, but a great disaster suddenly occurred. You painstakingly tried to salvage the situation, regardless of gains or losses. National opinions were divided. You lived in the mountains to express your ambition, practiced metaphysics, and did not forget national affairs. You taught and established societies, being impartial and not partisan. You led the wise and presided over the atmosphere. As the years became more treacherous, and strong enemies roamed, you accepted the order with a sigh and went north in a hurry. You resisted the enemy alone, relying only on sincerity. The northern border was thus safe, and the overall situation was stable. Matters were as tangled as silk, and your hard work was high. You made concessions in adversity, and ultimately became ill. Alas, my lord, you forgot yourself for the country, and did not refuse hard work and complaints. With iron shoulders, you unswervingly upheld righteousness. Alas, my lord, you are a hero of all ages. Those who come after will never forget your loyalty to the country. May you enjoy this offering.</p>
<p>Memorial Text of the National Government</p>
<p>Chairman Lin of the National Government specially sent Mayor Wu to offer a memorial text, saying, On December 26th, the 25th year of the Republic of China, Chairman Lin Sen of the National Government specially sent Mayor Wu Tiecheng of Shanghai to respectfully offer incense and pay tribute to the spirit of National Government Member Huang Yingbai, saying, Alas, the ocean tide is turbulent, and the country's path is difficult. Heaven does not pity us and has taken away our wise man. It is difficult to find talents to save the world, a common lament of ancient and modern times. The grand structure is being built, but the beam is suddenly lost. In your life, you were born in Zhejiang, endowed with intelligence. With ambitions like wind and clouds, and intelligence like ice and snow, you took the reins in Japan, with a high ambition for the universe. With the ability to adapt and store talent, you were endowed with both literary and military skills. You followed the Father of the Nation and allied overseas, uniting your comrades and following the principles. After the Xinhai Revolution, the Republic was established. You took charge of national plans and assisted in the new model. You took the lead in advocating disarmament, setting an example for the military. You soared high over thousands of miles in the South. Xiangcheng stole the country, and you went to the rescue with a crown. Riding through the ranks, you saw a line of life. You traveled far to search for political news, pondered the past, and revealed it to the people. To govern the country, talent is needed, and it is difficult to ensure impartiality. You rose again in the East Mountains to uphold the overall situation. You pushed your comrades forward with a sincere heart, moving eastwards towards the sea. You secretly supported the National Army and facilitated reunification. Without boasting or claiming credit, who could have known your deep plans? You took over the municipal government and later took charge of foreign affairs. Before your plans could be completed, your reputation was even more evident. You retired to an empty mountain, longing for national politics. You secretly discussed good plans, never forgetting your loyalty. In the 22nd year, the national crisis deepened. The bustling Yan City was filled with wind and cranes. You accepted the order and went north, feeling the difficulty. You made concessions in diplomacy. You were the only one who could be relied on. You weighed the situation and responded appropriately. You silently used your spirit to manage this crisis, hoping to plan for the future and care for the people. You had ways to heal the country, and your skills were hard-won. You did not claim credit for your achievements, and did not shirk responsibility for your faults. With sincerity for the country, you did not seek people's knowledge. In the stormy and dangerous boat, you supported it in the middle of the stream. Your heart and strength were exhausted, and your worries were different. You suffered from illness in Shanghai, and the days passed slowly. People in the central government praised you, and the public hoped to return. We hoped for your grand plans to bless our party and country. How could it be that you suddenly passed away and your spirit went to the stars? Your last words were earnest, and you were concerned about national affairs. You remained in our thoughts. The safety of East Asia was on your mind. Alas, my lord, why did you depart so quickly? Your loyalty and love can be made in the nine springs. There are classics for the funeral, and the central government praised you. The ceremony was a public burial, the light of Wu and Yue. It is not easy to pacify foreign and internal troubles. It is difficult to lose people in times of trouble, and the world is melancholy. Your merits are immortal, and your model still exists. We respectfully offer fragrant offerings and respectfully inform your spirit. May you enjoy this offering.</p>
<p>Memorial Text of Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang wrote a text, saying, On December 26th, the 25th year of the Republic of China, Chiang Kai-shek and others respectfully offer fragrant incense and pay tribute to the spirit of National Government Member Huang Yingbai, saying, Alas, Zheng Tan was destroyed, and Wu Gou was covered. The party lost a famous hero, and the country lost a great man. In your life, you were born with the spirit of the Dipper and Scorpio, the spirit of Huangyue, and the treasure of Zhejiang. You were young and talented, with wisdom. You were unrestrained and surpassed the ordinary. You had Pei Xiu's maps, Xiahou's calculations, Sun Wu's military strategy, and Huang Gu's principles. You combined literary and military skills, and were well-versed in everything. You observed the outside world, and your principles were profound. You were concerned about the difficulties and went east. You followed the first awakened and were intoxicated with innovation. You united your comrades, and the talented followed. The spirit was united, and the wind and clouds were calm. When the Wuhan incident occurred, you assisted the Shanghai army and pulled out Zhao Zhi. You saw the Han rites again. The usurpers stole the throne and coveted the divine weapon. You did not submit to Qin and rose up again. You participated in the Chinese Association and made concessions at the altar. You expanded education and lectured in the military. You assisted the righteous army and returned to the South. The revolutionary forces were transplanted to Youyan. You entered the government and rectified discipline. You removed Yu Bin and maintained the national system. The Northern Expedition was successful, and you were appointed mayor. Your reputation was trusted at home and abroad. You were promoted to foreign affairs. When the country was in crisis, you went to rectify the administration. You were busy planning the difficult mission. You did not count your merits or complaints. If it was beneficial to the country, you would die for it. You supported for many years, and your worries were numerous. You suffered from Ji An's illness and Marquis Wu's lack of food. The central government waited anxiously for you to bring rain. How could it be that you suddenly passed away in Shanghai? Your last words on your sickbed were concerned about national affairs. Your loyalty was unwavering. Even in death, you were still watching. The people shed tears, and the officials were sad. Your name will be passed down forever, and your achievements will be recorded. The rain in the borderland is bleak, and the north wind is cold. We respectfully offer pepper wine. May your spirit come and enjoy this offering.</p>
<p>Memorial Text of the Mayor</p>
<p>On December 26th, the 25th year of the Republic of China, Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of Shanghai, led all the officials of the municipal government to respectfully offer clear wine and sacrifices to the spirit of the late Shanghai's first Mayor, Huang Yingbai, saying, The stars are sinking, and the clouds are dimming over Shanghai. The people are shedding tears, and the streets are quiet. Heaven has brought misfortune, and Yinbin has lost its light. The country has lost a great man, and the central government is shocked. Alas, sir, you were born in Zhejiang, endowed with both literary and military skills, with a chest full of military strategy. You assisted the revolution and were a hero of the party and the country. Your achievements are recorded, and your merits are inscribed. You were the first mayor of Shanghai, and you started in difficult times. You set the example and prepared the school, summoning Bo Tang and erecting Yang Gong's monument. The old officials hated gratitude, and the old friends wept. You were ordered to the old capital, and it was a time of difficulty. You carefully planned and operated in silence, and you were trusted by China and foreign countries. You nourished yourself in the forest and enjoyed yourself in the hills. Your reputation was respected in the East Mountain. You came out of the Huang Pavilion. The two evils caused disaster, and a pillar was finally destroyed. People died, and the country suffered. The frost was bleak, and the wind was sad. Alas, the wind and rain are Xiao Xiao, sing a great invitation, the banners are magnificent, drive the cloud, the soul returns, the god's whirlwind, spring here, protect our cells, alas, alas, may you enjoy, in addition to the Foreign Minister Zhang Qun and other memorials, not recorded here.</p>

<h3>Cen Chai Suffers from Coal Poisoning - On a Night When Her Husband Did Not Return - She Lost Her Life</h3>
<p>Cen Chai, a woman from Shaoxing, was 21 years old. She lived with her husband, Cen Zenglai, at No. 11, Lane 557, Dongyouheng Road. It happened that her husband was not at home the night before. Because she was afraid of the cold, she lit a coal briquette stove in the bedroom for warmth and closed the windows tightly, causing coal poisoning. It was not until 7:00 AM the next morning, when her husband returned home, that he found her unconscious in bed. He rushed her to Shanghai Nursing Home for treatment, but she soon died. The hospital reported to the Jiuxing Road Police Station in charge, who sent investigators to investigate. The body was then taken to the Phelon Road Mortuary.

<h3>Sampan Capsizes - Seven People Fall into the River and Are Rescued</h3>
<p>Wang Baoyi, from Jiangbei, together with his sister-in-law, Mrs. Chen, and five children, Xingan and Xingming, recently arrived in Shanghai on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tai Shun steamer. Yesterday morning at 2:30 AM, after the steamer docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf on the 16th Pier, Wang and others were greeted by his cousin Wang Baogui and friend Qian Yuansheng, and boarded Sampan No. 849 to cross to Yangjiadu in Pudong to return home. At this time, three garbage boats were rushing to dock. Because the sampan had not yet left the dock, it was violently rammed by Garbage Boat No. 30542 and capsized, and seven passengers, both adults and children, fell into the river at the same time. Fortunately, they were rescued separately by the French Concession Chinese police and the garbage boat crews. Because all seven people had swallowed a considerable amount of river water, they were rushed to Guangci Hospital on Jinshenfu Road for treatment, and fortunately, they were all safe. Later, Li Wenqi, a Chinese detective from the Customs Water Police Station, took Zhou Xuecai, the crew of the offending boat, along with the luggage of the seven people, to the police station for investigation.</p>

<h3>National Goods Joint Venture Company - All Sectors Enthusiastically Subscribe to Shares - The Goal of $1 Million Can Be Achieved - Shanghai Has the Most Participants</h3>
<p>The China National Goods Joint Venture Company, initiated by the General Committee of the National Economic Construction Movement, has been actively recruiting shareholders since inviting leaders from all sectors across the country to form a preparatory committee and holding a preparatory meeting in Beijing, where the preparatory office was formally established. The articles of association, prospectus, share subscription form, and other documents were sent to various factories, companies, banks, and money shops for recruitment. According to a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency, the total capital stock of the company is temporarily set at $2 million in legal tender, divided into 4,000 shares, each share being $500. The capital is raised in two phases. In the first phase, 2,000 shares are raised, with the government subscribing to one-third and national goods factories and companies subscribing to two-thirds. All shares must be paid in full before the company is established, but individuals are not allowed to subscribe in their own names. If national goods factories and companies are willing to subscribe to more shares than the aforementioned quota, a portion of the government shares may be allocated to allow commercial shares to be subscribed. After the company is established, if newly established national goods factories and companies and consumer cooperatives in various regions that have not joined wish to subscribe to shares, a portion may also be transferred from the government shares. The second phase of capital, $1 million, will be raised after the company has been established for one year, as determined by the board of directors. Therefore, national goods companies, factories, consumer cooperatives, and others in various regions are enthusiastically subscribing to shares, especially in Shanghai. It is expected that the goal of $1 million will be reached soon, and a second preparatory meeting will be scheduled to discuss further preparatory matters.</p>

<h3>Yesterday, Shanghai District Court Strictly Interrogated the Ye Fu Kang Case; Lawyers Gu Ao and Gu Ji Rong Appeared in Court to Present Arguments; Repeatedly Questioned the Revocation of the Complaint by Wang Han Qing; Ye Stated That There Was No Such Person as Li Sun Min, Requesting Confrontation; the Court Ordered a Change of Date to Re-examine When Wang Han Qing Arrives in Court</h3>
<p>Former Judge of the Shanghai District Court, now the owner of a small Lu Song hat shop, lawyer Ye Fu Kang, was accused by Wang Han Qing, a Henan native who previously worked as a detective in the Hankou Public Security Bureau, in a complaint to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, of embezzling a large sum of money under the pretext of defending a case. The Ministry ordered the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor Tang to prosecute Ye Fu Kang, and a public prosecution was initiated. However, before the public trial, Wang Han Qing suddenly hired lawyer Gu Ji Rong to draft a statement requesting revocation and confessing to making false accusations. Wang himself fled to another port and never appeared in court. The court noted that Ye Fu Kang had twice, in 1933 and last year, reached settlements through lawyers Gu Ao, Zha Ruwei, Cai Ding, Shen Zengkuan, and others. According to Ye, he only received public funds of 4,000 yuan, while according to Gu Ao, the two settlements involved Ye Fu Kang returning as much as 6,300 yuan. In the previous summons of witness Hu Jin Kun, it was also stated that after this lawsuit, lawyer Gu Ao also brought a receipt for Ye Fu Kang's 20,000 yuan bail to the Great British Apartments to settle with Wang Han Qing, saying he was willing to pay 10,000 yuan to settle the matter. Judge Lu Hongyi of the court then ordered a cross-examination at 10:00 AM yesterday. Only Gu Ao and Gu Ji Rong arrived. The questioning officer asked Gu Ao, who admitted to the previous settlement but denied this one, also stating that he had never been to the Great British Apartments. He said that Wang Han Qing and others wanted 10,000 yuan, and when Ye Fu Kang questioned them after this lawsuit, he and lawyer Zha Ruwei discussed that Wang Han Qing was thinking about money, so they advised Ye to return a little to him, and not to be as short-sighted as them. Ye Fi Kang then said that he had already paid a 20,000 yuan bail to the court, and had a receipt to prove it, and the newspapers had reported it messily. Therefore, he, Zha Ruwei, Cai Ding, Shen Zengkuan published a statement in the newspaper on his behalf to clarify the untrue points, and Wang Han Qing made corrections. However, Wang Han Qing was illiterate. The court believed that he had repeatedly settled with them, but the parties repeatedly demanded it, which was a matter of morality, so he settled. The questioning officer said, "Didn't you tell witnesses Hu Jin Kun and Li Sunshi not to appear in court?" He replied, "No." He was asked whether they had said so during the investigation and trial, and he replied, "This is not my own business, why would I tell them not to come?" At this point, lawyer Gu Ji Rong was asked, "Didn't you say that Wang Han Qing could come to court, why hasn't he come now?" He replied, "Hu Jin Kun has already gone to Hankou to find him." He was asked, "Didn't Wang Han Qing go back to his hometown in Henan?" He replied, "Hu Jin Kun said he can find him." He was asked, "Who introduced Wang Han Qing to you to write the statement?" He replied, "Li Songtang introduced him." He was asked, "Was it to handle a case, or just to write the statement?" He replied, "Just to write the statement." He was asked, "What did he mean to write?" He replied, "He said the money was used by his wife, Zhang, and if the trial continued, it would be unfavorable to him, and he would be guilty of false accusation." He was asked, "Now he is suing, and the defendant is Ye Fu Kang, not him committing a crime, how can he write this statement out of thin air?" He replied, "That is what he meant." He was asked, "Does Wang Han Qing have mental illness?" He replied, "No." He was asked, "Then who came up with the idea to write the statement?" He replied, "He said to make such a statement." The official said, "Wang Han Qing has accused Ye Fu Kang more than once or twice. He himself is willing to admit to false accusations, and he's saying it casually? Is it really his own intention? Before he comes to court, this court cannot believe it." At this point, Ye Fu Kang stated that he was baffled by the words of Li Sunshi, Hu Jin Kun, Wang Han Qing, etc., and that there was no such person as Li Sunshi. The whole thing was fabricated, so Li Sunshi must appear in court. The official ordered that the date be changed and that Wang Han Qing be re-examined when he arrives in court.</p>

<h3>### A Quarrel Between Two Children Leads to a Case of Manslaughter; Fellow Villagers Bicker; Xia Cheng Shan Utters a Final Lament</h3>
<p>A four-year-old girl named Ai Mao, daughter of Jiangbei woman Zhou Wang (34 years old) residing at No. 401 Saposai Road, French Concession, was squatting on the ground in front of her door urinating at 9:00 AM yesterday, when a ten-year-old boy named Xiang Bao, son of local resident Lu Jin Kui (42 years old, working in a pharmacy) residing at No. 409, passed by and reached out to tease the girl's head. The girl's right arm had a smallpox vaccination that had not yet healed. Touching the vaccination scar caused the girl to cry in pain. Her mother, Zhou Wang, heard the noise from inside the house and came out to investigate. Upon learning that the child had been hurt by the Lu child, she went to the Lu's house to question the Lu child's parents. Both sides began to argue and quarrel, and more than ten neighbors and fellow villagers from both sides gathered, bickering with each other. When they were about to resort to violence, Xia Cheng Shan (approximately 40 years old), a Jiangbei native who pulled a rickshaw and lived at No. 403 on the same road, kindly stepped forward to mediate. Chen Zhi Xiang (36 years old), a Jiangyin native and tailor who lived with the Lu family, worried that Xia was helping the other side, and immediately reached out to stop Xia. Xia lost his balance and fell backward, hitting his head on the door sill, causing a concussion. Yuan Si, a Jiangbei native who lived and worked with Xia, picked Xia up and sent him to Guangci Hospital, but Xia died before receiving medical treatment. The hospital reported to the French Concession police, who sent detectives to the scene to investigate. Lu Jin Kui, Zhou Wang, Chen Zhi Xiang, and others involved were taken to the police station for questioning. After questioning, Lu and Chen were detained pending further investigation. Xia's body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall for an autopsy, and a report will be submitted to the Second Special Court tomorrow to send personnel for examination. The deceased was working alone in Shanghai, and his family is in the countryside of Dongtai. His fellow villagers have sent a telegram to notify his family to come to Shanghai to claim the body for burial.</p>
<h3>### Traveler Found Dead from Poisoning at the Aidoo Hotel; the Deceased Claimed to Be Lu Xin Chang</h3>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the 25th of this month, a man claiming to be Lu Xin Chang, 29 years old, a local native engaged in the foreign goods business, checked into Room 6 of the Aidoo Hotel at No. 10, Chu Qing Lane, West Xin Qiao Street, French Concession. By noon yesterday, he had not yet gotten up. The tea boy, Xu A Chang (35 years old, from Shaoxing), knocked on the door as usual, asking if the room needed to be extended. To his surprise, there was no response after knocking for a long time. He opened the door and went inside, finding Lu unconscious on the bed, unresponsive, and his face turned pale. Realizing something was wrong, he informed the cashier, who had him taken to Renji Hospital. After the doctor's diagnosis, it was found that Lu had committed suicide by taking poison. Due to severe poisoning, he died at 2:45 PM despite medical treatment. The hospital reported to the French Concession police, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was then transported to the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall for an autopsy, pending investigation and notification of the family. A report will be submitted to the Second Special Court tomorrow to send personnel for examination.</p>

Zhuang's lawyer, Chen Ting Rui, presented the divorce certificate and evidence of alimony payments, but Zhu firmly denied the divorce. This case had already been argued, but the presiding judge, Qian Hong Ye, believed that the facts of the case depended on the civil resolution of whether the divorce certificate was valid. Therefore, he ordered Zhu to first file a civil suit. Now that Zhu has complied with the order and filed a separate lawsuit in the civil court, Judge Qian announced yesterday that the trial would be suspended.</p>

<h3>Xu Xue Seng Sues Zhu Guang Han Case; Gao Jin Sheng Testified Yesterday; Gao Denies His Aunt Wrote the Letter; The Plaintiff's Withdrawal is Suspicious; the Court Orders Xu Xue Seng to be Summoned for Another Interrogation</h3>
<p>Xu Xue Seng from Songjiang, who had served as the director of the Gansu Anti-Smoking Bureau and a county magistrate, was severely injured in the French Concession Wang Zhi Road when Gao Jin Sheng splashed nitric acid on him. Gao Jin Sheng was sentenced to four years in prison by the Second Special Court. Xu then sued Zhu Guang Han, also from Songjiang, in the Nanshi Court, claiming that ten years ago, Zhu had instigated Chen A Xi to instruct Gao Jin Sheng to cause harm, requesting an investigation. Zhu claimed that Xu was insatiable in borrowing money and was taking the opportunity to make false accusations. Both sides held their ground, and the trial has been ongoing for a long time without a resolution. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Bo Jun opened the court and brought Gao Jin Sheng from the French Concession for questioning. Gao Jin Sheng testified that he was 25 years old, from Shanghai, lived in Nanyang Bridge, and owned a bicycle shop. He did not know Zhu Guang Han or Chen A Xi, nor was he instigated by them to cause harm. He was asked if he had written a letter to his aunt while in custody, and he replied that he did not have such an aunt at all. The official ordered the handwriting to be compared. Finally, the defendant's defense lawyer stated that the plaintiff had suddenly submitted a statement withdrawing the case, which clearly indicated that there was insufficient evidence and he feared it would be detrimental to him. Gao Jin Sheng, a key witness in the case, also made it clear in his testimony that the facts were clear, and requested that a ruling be made immediately to avoid further litigation. The official ordered Xu Xue Seng to be summoned for another interrogation.</p>
<h3>### Zhang Wei Liang's Failure to Pay Alimony Leads to Civil and Criminal Lawsuits; Marriage with Money, but no Money to Repay Debts Puts Dong Mei Zhen in a Difficult Position; a Lawsuit for Damage and a Lawsuit for Objection Keep Zhang Yu Liang Busy</h3>
<p>Zhang Wei Liang and Zhang Yu Liang, local natives, had jointly opened a brothers' dental hospital at No. 3, Zhejiang Road, Zhifu Road. Zhang Wei Liang previously married Dong Mei Zhen from Ningbo. They lived together for 13 years and had three children. Last year, Zhang and Dong had a disagreement, which led to litigation. As a result, the court ruled that Zhang and Dong should be divorced and ordered Zhang to pay alimony of 2,160 yuan. After the case was finalized, Zhang failed to pay, resulting in his detention by the court for a month and a half. Zhang then agreed to pay on a monthly basis and was released. However, after regaining his freedom, Zhang went back on his word and married a woman surnamed Xu at the Central Hotel on the 9th of this month, spending thousands of yuan. Dong, seeing Zhang's lavish wedding and his failure to pay the alimony she deserved, requested the First Special Court to seal up Zhang Wei Liang's movable property in the brothers' dental hospital. The court approved the request, and the clerk and bailiff sealed the property on the 14th of this month. When the movable property in Zhang Wei Liang's medical room was to be sealed up, Zhang Wei Liang's copper sign was still hanging at the entrance of the medical room. However, Zhang Yu Liang first expressed an objection to the execution, and then removed the Zhang Wei Liang's copper sign. Therefore, Dong took photos of the traces left on the wall where the copper sign was hung, and accused Zhang Yu Liang of helping to damage her debt claim, filing a complaint with the First Special Court in accordance with Article 356 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, Judge Dai Rong Duo summoned Zhang Yu Liang to the Second Criminal Court. Zhang Yu Liang testified that although the brothers' dental hospital was nominally jointly organized by his brothers, they actually each handled their own affairs, and the medical rooms were also separated. Later, Wei Liang owed rent, and the landlord sealed up his movable property, which he then bought after the auction. Wei Liang was also hired by him as an assistant. The copper sign was indeed removed by him, because after Wei Liang's marriage on the 9th, there were disagreements, so he was fired. Since he had been fired, the copper sign was removed on the 10th, not when it was sealed on the 14th. He had also filed a lawsuit objecting to the sealing. Dong Mei Zhen claimed that all of this was a deliberate attempt to deceive the court and requested severe punishment according to the law. Judge Dai, after reviewing the testimonies, ordered the end of the debate and set the sentencing for 2:00 PM on the 30th.</p>
<h3>### Dr. Ma Song Ting to Return Home Tomorrow; Efforts to Promote Islamic Culture; Expected to Arrive in Shanghai on the 28th</h3>
<p>Dr. Ma Song Ting is a well-known Ahong of Islam in our country. In 1925, he and Mr. Tang Ke San, the current member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, founded the Chengda Normal School in Jinan, and later moved it to Beiping. The purpose was to cultivate religious teachers with both new and old knowledge, so as to communicate Chinese and Western cultures. In the past ten years, in addition to being assigned to the Northwest to establish the latest type of primary and secondary schools, the graduates have been sent to Egypt to enter Al-Azhar University, specializing in philosophy and Islamic history and culture. Therefore, the school's achievements have made great strides.</p>
<p>In 1932, Mr. Ma Song Ting traveled to Egypt, and paid homage to the former King Fuad I of Egypt. The King donated thousands of books and specially sent two doctors to China to serve as volunteer professors and agreed to accept as many students as our country sends, with free tuition (food and accommodation are all provided by the Ministry of Education).</p>

<p>In order to further strengthen emotional ties, Mr. Ma Song Ting went to Egypt again on October 5th of this year, staying in Cairo for more than a month. He paid homage to the new King Farouk I of Egypt and the Prime Minister of the country, Nahas Pasha, who gave him a warm welcome and promised to send more professors to our country and donate thousands of books to enrich the Fuad Library. He also made very good criticisms of our President Chiang.</p>
<p>During this trip abroad, Mr. Ma carried more than 100 copies of the Three Principles of the People in English and French and distributed them to the Egyptian government and the public. He also lectured on the construction of our country in recent years and the situation of Muslims in our country at the Posai Municipal Government and various cultural organizations in Cairo, which were warmly welcomed by the upper and lower classes of the country's public opinion and cultural circles.</p>
<p>It is reported that Mr. Ma will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (28th) morning on the Italian ship Conte Verde. It is said that many people are planning to welcome him.</p>

<h3>Kidnapping a Married Woman: Man and Woman Each Sentenced to Months in Prison - Mrs. Yang Wang and Her Husband Estranged - Chen Gongjian Takes Advantage to Entice</h3>
<p>A young woman from Haizhou, Yang Wang (also known as Xiuying), residing in a bungalow on Huasheng Road, worked in a cotton mill. Recently, she had frequent quarrels with her husband, Yang Qingyuan, and often confided in her neighbor and fellow townsman, Wang Jinbiao. Wang harbored malicious intentions, and on October 22nd at 5 PM, he seized the opportunity to incite her to run away. She took all her clothes and jewelry and went with him to a hotel upstairs in the French Concession’s Yong'an Street, where Chen Gongjian from Qingjiang, a friend of Wang's, resided. Wang Jinbiao claimed that she was his goddaughter, and they hid her there for a month. They conspired with Chen to take her to another port to sell her, but because they couldn't find a buyer and feared detection by the French police, they moved to a certain address on Fuyou Road in the Chinese district to stay temporarily. They told the woman that there was a factory in Nanjing with good wages. In reality, they had plotted to trick her into going to Nanjing and then selling her to Fujian to split the profits. However, detectives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau found out about their plan. On the 16th, Chen Gongjian was arrested. Yang Wang took the opportunity to escape.

<h3>Shanghai's Electrical Manufacturing Industry (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Chief Editor of China WeChat</p>
<p>(Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce, Part 40)</p>
<p>According to our agency’s comprehensive survey, the business situation of electrical materials in Shanghai last year was generally sluggish in the spring. With the gradual lengthening of foreign exchange rates, manufacturers with large inventories even reported significant losses. The closure of Shanghai Bulb Company in March was a result of this influence. However, the downward trend reversed after autumn, further impacted by the Italo-Ethiopian War and the new currency system. Material prices rose sharply, allowing those with large inventories to more than make up for the losses of the first half of the year. Companies such as Huitong, Hongkang, Xiefeng, and Tianfaxie all achieved profits. Regarding the production and sales of the light bulb industry in Shanghai over the past year, according to a survey conducted by the Greater American Evening Post among manufacturers in the industry, the highest output was from the Ya'er Bulb Factory, reaching 2 million units, with a business value of 400,000 yuan. Followed by Huade Factory, although its output was less than Ya'er Bulb Factory, the number of high-voltage bulbs it produced was greater, so its business volume exceeded the former by more than 600,000 yuan. However, both were lower than the previous year. At the same time, due to oversupply, some bulb prices fell below cost. In the twenty-third year, the selling price of ordinary bulbs was 32-33 yuan per hundred, but last year it once fell to about 10 yuan. Shenbao reported slightly different figures, stating that the total output of bulbs from various bulb factories in Shanghai last year was over 16 million units, with Ya'er accounting for one-third, or over 5 million units, which is more than 3 million units higher than the previous statement. The highest selling price for ordinary bulbs was 22 yuan per hundred, and the lowest was 8 yuan. Both are for reference.</p>

In the second half, the left wing lacked strength, resulting in many missed opportunities. Towards the end, Willy Walter scored another goal, resulting in a 2-0 victory for the French businessmen. The glorious Meiling Engineering Cup was once again lost, which is regrettable. Mayor Wu, as the event was for charity, personally presided over the opening ceremony, watched the game from the sidelines, and presented awards and auctioned the old ball before leaving. All proceeds from yesterday will be distributed by the association to various charitable organizations in the city.</p>
<p>After the game, the president of the Shanghai Football Association, Green Xu, and the general secretary of the Association for the Advancement of Physical Education, Shen Siliang, both gave speeches, and Mayor Wu was invited to give instructions and present awards. The mayor personally presented the Charity Cup to the captain of the French business team, Bausch, to keep for a year. Then, the mayor auctioned off the ball, starting at 50 yuan and increasing to 65 yuan. Finally, Mr. Kailai, a staff member of the French Businessmen's Association, purchased it for 70 yuan. Therefore, all the silver cups and leather balls were won by the French Businessmen's Association in this tournament. The lineups of both teams remained unchanged yesterday, as follows:</p>

<p>Celebration Order: (1) Stand at attention; (2) Sing the Party song; (3) Pay the highest respect to the Party and National flags, and the portrait of the Premier and the Leader; (4) Chairman respectfully reads the Premier's will; (5) Silence; (6) Chairman reports; (7) Director Pan delivers a speech; (8) Speeches; (9) Shout slogans; (10) Fire cannons; (11) Have a meal together.</p>
<p>Director's Speech: Director Pan Gongzhan said in his speech, "Comrades, today is the happiest day for our entire country. Our leader's fiftieth birthday. When Shanghai's school youth and students celebrated the leader, they once said that our revolutionary leader's work has made great contributions in the recent period. On the 12th of this month, when Zhang Xueliang hijacked him in Xi'an, we heard the news and unanimously condemned the rebels. We believed that he could get out of danger safely and continue to exercise his functions. Now that we have our leader back safely, the grief we felt in those ten days has turned into joy, fully expressing our support for the leader. From this Xi'an Incident and the return of our leader, we can see three forces: (1) the power of the leader's great and noble personality to influence people. Our national revival has been fully revealed from this incident. Today's celebration is not only to celebrate the leader's return, but also to celebrate the national revival. We must recognize that our leader went to Xi'an knowing it was dangerous, but he did not avoid the danger. This shows our leader's courage. The whole country already knows about Zhang Xueliang's conspiracy and advised the leader not to go. Our leader was not afraid of death and wanted to use his great personality to move people who could not be moved, so he went to Xi'an. Unexpectedly, Zhang Xueliang, with the heart of a wolf, could not only not be moved, but also hijacked him. The first thing our leader did in the siege was to make Zhang Xueliang moved by the leader's diary. At the same time, when Zhang Xueliang repeatedly decided to see him, the leader said to him, 'You call me Chairman, which means you are my subordinate, and you should send me back to Beijing. If you want to threaten me, you are a rebel and you can kill me immediately.' This is also the greatness of the leader. Finally, the leader wrote a letter to Minister He to stop the bombing, not sacrificing the people for personal reasons. Furthermore, as soon as he arrived in Luoyang, he ordered a halt to military action. This kind of great and noble personality, although it cannot completely move Zhang Xueliang, can at least make him realize the greatness of the leader's personality. (2) The power of national unity. Although the hijacking was unfortunate, it provided a test, which proved that except for a very small number of traitors and communists, all 450 million people in the country unanimously supported the leader and condemned the rebels. This unprecedented great test proves the strength of China. This kind of force is enough to overthrow any huge turmoil, let alone a Zhang Xueliang. This incident has attracted the attention of countries all over the world, who are watching how China responds to this incident to determine whether the Chinese nation can revive. Let's look at the enthusiastic and joyful scene last night, and the expressions of pain and anger in the previous few days. It is simply that everyone, regardless of age, gender, or class, is united. This united and great force is enough to prove that China has reached the time of roaring, and the national revival will definitely succeed. (3) The power of a sound government organization. People say that we are unorganized, but this test proves that our government is organized and does not waver because one person has lost his freedom. Therefore, after the leader was hijacked, the central government's first step was to dismiss and severely punish, and the second step was to order a crusade. The steps were clear and the system was not chaotic, which shows that our government has an absolutely sound organization. Zhang Xueliang hijacked the leader entirely as a means of coercion, thinking that we would definitely be constrained. However, the government's decision was to not be constrained. The power of such a government with a sound organization can overcome the rebels. In short, the test of this incident proves that China has a leader with a great personality, a united people, and a government with a sound organization. The combination of these three forces is a modern country. We have all the conditions, so China is already a modern country. Therefore, today we celebrate the leader's escape from danger, and at the same time, we celebrate that our nation has embarked on the road to revival."</p>

<h3>Gold Circulation in One Year</h3>
<p>Was 295,680 Liang</p>
<p>In recent years, the price of gold has been expensive, and the number of inland gold concentrated in Shanghai and exported from Shanghai is also amazing. In order to understand the flow of gold, the volume of spot cash delivery of this year's (25th year) Gold Exchange can be seen. It is found that the total number of spot gold deliveries at the Gold Exchange this year reached 29,568, of which January was the largest and July was the least. This is due to the relationship between the source of each road and the settlement price, and the majority of the release belongs to the spot number of households, and the receipt is purely the powerful people in the financial community, so the recent gold reserves in this port have been extremely depleted, the bid gold because it is tied to the settlement price is difficult to move, the source is rare, the quick red needs to be added nearly thirty yuan, now the bid gold is also five yuan higher than the futures, and still lacks supply, this can be a sign of the exhaustion of gold, now the detailed number of cash receipts and releases in the twenty-fifth year is detailed on the left,</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn</h3>
<h3>Yarn Prices Once Soared, Affected by the Tri-Product Market Surge, Ultimately Falling Due to Swaps and Liquidations</h3>
<p>Initially, the yarn market in Osaka saw a surge of 12 yuan in cotton yarn prices. It was said that the frequent rise in cotton yarn prices was due to the import of 800,000 bales of Australian wool in the coming year, along with Japan exporting 153.7 million square yards of goods. Consequently, yarn prices soared, causing anxiety in the local market and driving strong buying interest and price increases. However, as the year-end approached and the February futures delivery was ample, many sellers emerged, loosening the market and shifting the trend downward. Nevertheless, some bulls remained optimistic about the forward market.</p>
<p>A Loss of Over Two Yuan in January Yarn Alone</p>
<p>The opening price of the January yarn futures market was calm, as the December delivery had a substantial 7,700 bales, suppressing market sentiment. However, news from the Osaka tri-product yarn market caused a surge of 12 yuan in all months. This suddenly boosted buying interest, with the February contract jumping by [blank] yuan and 70 cents, and the March contract rising by 3 yuan and 88 cents. In the second round of trading, Changfeng and Yuda heavily sold near-term contracts, softening the market and dropping prices by 10 cents to [blank] yuan and 90 cents. However, spot yarn business remained robust. By the third closing, the market was flat, with January rising only 30 cents compared to the previous day's close, and the far-month rising 1 yuan and 20 cents to [blank] yuan and 50 cents. In the afternoon session, rumors spread that a certain merchant and company were swapping out of the market, further weakening market sentiment. The forward market was also affected, with prices steadily declining. As a result, all months fell by 2 yuan, 50 cents, 60 cents to 1 yuan and 30 cents compared to the morning closing. It was found that Yuda sold 5,350 bales, Gengfeng 1,900 bales, Xingchang 1,100 bales, Changfeng 3,300 bales, Mingde 1,650 bales, and RunKang 1,050 bales. Buyers included [blank] Ji 1,100 bales, [blank] Fu 800 bales, Tong Ji 1,350 bales, Hengsheng [blank] thousand and 300 bales, Shen Ji 1,050 bales, Wang Taixing and [blank] each 400 bales, Dachangcheng 1,300 bales, Xiesheng 900 bales, Fukang 850 bales, and Taichang 1,200 bales. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Thread Prices Rise by Five Yuan</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. It is found that all guilds bought a total of 875 bales throughout the day, with sales prices rising by 2 yuan and thread prices rising by 5 yuan. The purchase volume of each guild is listed below:</p>
<p>Guangdong: [blank] 220, [blank] 510; Xiamen: [blank] 5</p>
<p>Shantou: [blank] 55; Hankou: [blank] 15; Luzhou: [blank] 40</p>
<p>Sichuan: [blank] 30</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Lack Momentum, Falling with the Yarn Market</h3>
<p>Initially, cotton prices rose due to the consistent increases in overseas [blank] American [blank] and the Osaka tri-product market surge of 2 to [blank] 3 yuan [blank], raising market sentiment and driving prices higher. However, in the afternoon, the cotton market was drawn into the vortex of the declining yarn market and steadily declined.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Prices Fall by Around Ten Cents</p>
<p>The opening price of the spot cotton market was bullish due to the surge in the Osaka tri-product cotton market by 2 yuan, 78 cents to 3 yuan, and the consistent increase in American and Indian cotton prices. All months rose uniformly, jumping by 60-70 cents. However, as the yarn market retreated, the cotton market was constrained. As a result, all months rose by 25 to 30 cents compared to the previous day's closing. In the afternoon session, market sentiment was weak, and prices steadily declined due to the weakness of the yarn market and floating profits being liquidated. [blank] however, daily [blank] all fell by 35 to 40 cents. It was found that [blank] Tong sold 5,200 [blank], [blank] Feng 3,500 dan, Dafeng 1,700 dan, Jinchang 2,600 dan, Daqing 2,000 dan, Changji 3,400 dan, Wang Taixing 1,700 dan, Dachang 6,500 dan, Shengyuan 4,000 dan, Changhe 10,300 dan, Xingchang 1,200 dan, RunKang 4,000 dan, Hengyi 4,200 dan, Taixing 2,200 dan, Changfeng Bafeng 600 dan, Yikang 5,700 dan, Daji 2,800 dan, Hexing 1,800 dan, Taichang 3,100 dan, and Yichang 2,300 dan. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Factories Continue to Purchase Spot Cotton</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is still good, with factories continuing to make sporadic transactions. The source is 1,100 bales of Yao cotton and 890 bales of Tong cotton.</p>

<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Has No Futures Available for Sale</h3>
<p>Japanese Factories Are Fully Booked for January, February, March, and April; Chinese Merchants Also Have Large Orders and Are Rushing to Weave</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was stimulated by the continued surge in the Osaka tri-product cotton market, and market sentiment improved. Japanese manufacturers continue to refuse to sell futures, as they already have a large number of orders outstanding, especially for poplin gray fabric, which is made of all-yarn and 42-count single-strand and 60-count single-strand yarn. It is reported that the output for January, February, March, and April is already fully booked. Chinese manufacturers also have large orders to weave, mainly for old-style and new-style poplin gray fabric. Other weaving factories that also have finishing and dyeing departments are also starting to weave gray fabric to supply their own factory's needs. There are more orders from distant customers in Hunan, etc., and from wholesale shops on this street. However, due to the high prices of yarn and thread, the cost has increased, reaching 6-7 cents per yard. Therefore, customers are hesitant to make reservations, and [blank] white goods [blank] twill [blank] return to strong, [blank] 1-2 cents of [blank] goods are stronger than those from our factory. Nowadays, flannel goods and dark-colored cloths are still soft. Sales of coarse cloth, coarse twill, and patterned goods [blank] report a stable situation. Factories in Yunnan, Hunan, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Bengbu, Xuzhou, and Shanghai are all making slight progress, with more transactions in plain cotton cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill. However, the Guangdong, Northern, and Local guilds are all particularly [blank].</p>
<h3>Dried and Fresh Goods: Orchid Seeds, Long Out of Stock, Have Arrived</h3>
<p>Orchid seeds have been out of stock for a long time, almost two months. It is found that the higher-stocking firms in the market have all reported stockouts, with only a few inferior goods remaining. The production price was previously reported to have risen by 12 yuan. Yesterday, it was heard that Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. [blank] should be imported, with a small amount being shipped. There are only five boxes. Samples will be available today. If the color is bright yellow and the aroma is fragrant, the asking price is expected to increase.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Over a Thousand Pieces of Green and Red Sugar Have Been Offered</h3>
<p>The sugar market trend was flat yesterday. The association's [blank] prices for grades such as 24 coarse white and Dongbai numbers 489 and original fine white remained unchanged. Transactions for numbered grades were still lively. It is estimated that the Xinghua guild offered over a hundred boxes of high-grade green flakes at 10 yuan, 70 cents. Also, the Guangchao guild offered dozens of bags of special high-grade Yu Ji green at 13 yuan, 80 cents, and over a hundred bags of Huanggang green at 13 yuan, 12 cents. The Fengho bag shop offered 160 bags of red sugar at 15 yuan. Gao Hainan offered 5,000 bags of red sugar at 14 yuan, 20 cents, and [blank] Tong offered over 700 bags at 13 yuan, 90 cents. Zhu Qing offered over a hundred bags at 12 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Recent Situation of Moroccan Green Tea</h3>
<p>The Moroccan green tea market situation was previously affected by the Spanish War and the French franc [blank] although [blank] [blank] good [blank]. According to recent news from British and French tea [blank] the [blank] tea [blank] route still cannot be unimpeded. This year, our country has imported 180,000 boxes of flowers such as Chun Mee and Needle Mee [blank] and Xiu Mee [blank]. Sales of goods such as Needle Mee and Pearl Tea are [blank] good and prices are also stable. High-grade Chun Mee and local Huzhou route goods are also selling quite well. However, medium-grade Chun Mee from Tunxi, Shexian, and Suian routes has slightly fallen in price due to the excessive quantity. The [blank] route for broken Mee tea is also reduced compared to other flowers.</p>
<h3>"To Do Great Things, First Set Great Ambitions"</h3>
<p>— Gao Qiming</p>
<p>Children, I know you are preparing to do great things! Some want to be scientists like Edison.</p>
<p>Some want to be writers like Andersen.</p>
<p>Some want to be athletes like Owens.</p>

<p>But children, you should first think about how to prepare to accomplish great deeds. Here, I give you eight words, which are—</p>
<p>"To Do Great Things, First Set Great Ambitions"</p>
<p>You must know. Having great ambitions means setting a goal in front of you. If you embrace your ambitions and strive to achieve them, you can realize your great deeds. Children! I hope you set great ambitions and prepare to do great things in the future. I hope that great ambitions will produce more national heroes like Yue Fei, Shi Kefa, Wen Tianxiang, Guo Ziyi, and Qi Jiguang.</p>
<h3>The Story of Lincoln Growing a Beard</h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>Isn't the portrait of President Lincoln, the American emancipator of slaves, that we see every day, full of beard? In fact, he didn't grow a beard until he became president at the age of 51. The reason he grew a beard has a small story. When the United States was electing a president in 1860, Lincoln was the Republican presidential candidate. For publicity purposes, the Republican Party posted his portraits all over the streets. An eleven-year-old girl accidentally saw Lincoln's face in the portrait, which was shaved clean, and thought to herself that a country's president shouldn't be solemn without a beard. So she wrote a letter to Lincoln, which read: "Dear Mr. Lincoln, I think you would look much better with a beard. I have four brothers, two Republicans and two Democrats. If you listen to me and grow a beard, I think I can persuade my two Democratic brothers to vote for you." Lincoln received the letter and wrote back: "Thank you for your kindness, but if I listen to you and grow a beard right away, don't you think I'll be laughed at for being infatuated?" Later, Lincoln was elected president. One day, when he was taking a train to West Town in Washington State, where the little girl lived, he sent someone to bring the little girl to him. As soon as he saw her coming, he jumped off the train, walked through the crowd, and sat with her next to the station platform. He pointed to his face and said, "Little [one], look, didn't I grow [it]? I grew it for you." With that, he gave her a warm kiss. But from then until Lincoln was assassinated, they never met again. The little girl regarded this as supreme glory, kept it firmly in her heart, and often talked about it to others. Who was the little girl? She was Mrs. Pillings, an 88-year-old woman from Telleffos Town, Kansas, who recently passed away.</p>

<h3>Plants</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>One day, Min'er unintentionally pulled up a small tree. He didn't even know why he pulled it up. But he stared at the tree blankly and said to himself, a tree always has these three parts: root, stem, and leaves. What are these three parts for? This strange opening question made him unable to answer. This kind of question that he couldn't answer was often discovered unintentionally.</p>
<p>"Brother, look, eight or nine out of ten trees in the world have these three parts: root, stem, and leaves. What are these three parts for?"</p>
<p>"Yes, almost all plants have these three parts. Not only are there the root, stem, and leaf parts, but the more advanced plants also have the flower, fruit, and seed parts. The root, stem, leaf, flower, fruit, and seed are all called organs. The root, stem, and leaf are called vegetative organs, and the flower, fruit, and seed are called reproductive organs. These six organs all have special structures and functions, but their structures cannot be seen by our naked eyes, and each organ cooperates to maintain the life of the plant. Speaking of the functions of the six organs, you can know if you think carefully. I might as well tell you first: the root, usually the roots grow in the soil, but there are also those that grow in water and air, but these are just exceptions. The function of the roots growing in the soil is twofold: (1) To absorb water and minerals dissolved in the water from the soil and transport them to the stem, (2) To enable the part of the plant on the ground to stand upright firmly in the air, (3) Store the nutrients already made in the leaves. Stem: The stem grows in the air. Its functions are four. (1) Spread the leaves in the air so that each leaf receives enough sunlight, because the leaves can make more nutrients in the sunlight. (2) Continue to transport the water and dissolved minerals sent by the roots to the leaves. (3) Transport the nutrients that have been manufactured in the leaves to all parts of the plant body, (4) Store nutrients for a long or short period of time. Leaves: Leaves all grow on the stem. The main function is to make food. Flowers, fruits, and seeds are all for plants to produce small plants and extend their race. However, these six organs are only found in higher plants.</p>
<p>What are higher plants?</p>
<p>"Plants can be divided into major categories: (1) Seed plants. These are all propagated by planting seeds. They are the most advanced class in the plant kingdom and have a close relationship with humans. (2) Ferns: They have roots, stems, and leaves, but their method of reproduction is still fern spores. A spore is just a particle. Producing this spore does not require flowering procedures, so it is lower than seed plants. (3) Mosses: Most grow in water or shady and damp places, but have no roots. (4) Algae and fungi plants: These are the lowest-level plants, the structure is very simple, and there is no distinction between roots, stems, and leaves."</p>
<h3>Strange Water Spider</h3>
<p>— Zhong Mei</p>
<p>"Brother Min, what is that thing in the water over there?" Little Yong asked in surprise, flashing his eyes, while pointing his little finger at the thing in the water. Brother Min looked for a while, then answered him: "Brother Yong, that's probably a water spider."</p>
<p>"Then what do they use to breathe in the water? Are they like fish using gills and humans using lungs?"</p>
<p>"Their breathing apparatus is extremely strange, and it is not like fish breathing with gills or we humans breathing with lungs, but with a kind of air storage room. This air storage room is oblong, and the opening is at the bottom. They don't have to work hard to build it, they just need to use the viscous silk in their abdomen to make it. They transport air using the bubble method. After they climb to the surface of the water, they use a pair of feet to stroke, and they make a small bubble. Then they put the bubble in the middle of their feet and clamp it into the water. After storing the gas, they break the bubble, and the gas rises into the air storage room. After doing this more than ten times, the air storage room is filled with fresh air."</p>
<p>"What kind of work do they do in the summer?"</p>
<p>"The work they have to do in the summer is to reproduce. The number of water spider eggs is often very large, some have thousands and hundreds. They put them inside a shell made of silk. After not much time, these eggs turn into small water spiders, and crawl out of the silk shell. After not much time, they can also build air storage rooms and transport fresh air.</p>
<p>"Brother Min, what are they used for?"</p>
<p>"Their usefulness is also great. They often help us catch mosquitoes and poisonous flies on the water surface, so they are also very beneficial animals."</p>
<h3>Snail Encirclement of Centipede</h3>
<p>— Pillow</p>
<p>According to common sense [blank] judgment: The centipede is one of the famous five poisonous creatures, that is, it has [blank] long body and the most healthy feet. The so-called "a hundred-legged worm dies but does not fall," how could there be a standard weak insect, the snail, that is less than an inch long, moves slowly, and is regarded as being incapable of anything [blank] conquering it? I was always surprised that when we Jiangnan people occasionally saw a centipede crawling nearby, we wanted to kill it immediately to avoid future troubles, but we were afraid of poisoning the skin by catching it with our hands, so we often used a superstitious curse method, chanting: "Land slug land slug land slug..." Saying this repeatedly, [blank] it is said to be very effective, and it will naturally make the centipede's white limbs weak and its crawling sluggish. It gives people time to find a weapon of attack and kill it. It turns out that the land slug is the common name of the snail; I don't know why the centipede is so afraid of the snail, even to the point of being terrified at the mention of its name? After my brother-in-law, the physician Zhou Mingxin, witnessed a heart-pounding invasion battle, it can accurately explain that their restraint comes from a reason.</p>
<p>One night, Zhou Jun inadvertently caught sight of a large centipede on the base of the wall, arching its body almost bent and sticking together, supporting it with only the feet on both sides of the head and tail. This spectacle led Zhou Jun to carry a lamp and look closer. He then saw a snail near the centipede, leisurely continuing its work of circling. The viscous liquid left behind where it traveled sparkled with a spiral line. The circle surrounding it further away was looser, clearly [blank] visible. Under the circumstances of the snail slowly crawling on the wall in a situation that was slow but unceasing, circling smaller and smaller, closer and closer, this was truly not far-fetched, the centipede's tiptoed feet were standing closer and closer, and the towering body was bent tighter and tighter. The shaky tower-like body became top-heavy, and it finally failed to maintain its position and collapsed. At the same time, its life disappeared without any physiological recovery!</p>
<p>It turns out that the centipede is most afraid of the viscous liquid excreted by the snail. Not only does it not dare to touch it slightly, but it also feels uncomfortable smelling the odor. What is strange is that the snail will know how the centipede is, and then it will start its tactics. From afar, it seems to be carelessly walking around the big circle with its viscous liquid, gradually circling closer. The centipede relies on its venom to run rampant and recklessly, and suddenly it will retreat without stopping when it approaches the liquid line left by the snail. After this experience, it is determined to avoid it from afar. At first, it was still carefree, but it never knew that its body had fallen into a heavy siege and could not move a step. In the end, it was trapped inside, with no place to live, to the point of death.</p>
<p>In this way, the little snail should not be underestimated.</p>
<h3>Di'er Is Sick</h3>
<p>— Chonglou</p>
<p>Di'er is my niece. She has a pair of bright eyes and a lively personality. I once wrote an article introducing her to the little readers of this publication.</p>
<p>I was separated from Di'er for several years. When I returned to my hometown this year, Di'er's body had grown a lot, and she was no longer a child who wanted me to hold her. However, her temperament was still so lively. Whenever she saw me, she always wanted me to hang her on my arm and rotate her like an airplane.</p>
<p>Later, we went to travel to Mount Hua, and we also took Di'er with us. Di'er was not afraid of the dangerous road. She ran and jumped on the mountain road [blank], refusing to ride in a sedan chair, and climbed the iron rope with us all the way to the precipitous ridge of Qianchi Zhang.</p>
<p>But since I returned to Shanghai, I have received several letters from my hometown in succession, all saying that Di'er was sick, and that she had a fever and cough every day... I'm afraid it's [blank] early stage tuberculosis! This news made me very anxious. I wanted to see her illness but couldn't. I could only write letters to my family to teach them to take good care of her and treat her. Now I always have to remember her bright eyes in my heart!</p>
<p>Little readers! Do you also miss Di'er's illness? Then I hope you pay attention to hygiene and don't let your body get sick.</p>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>— Householder</p>
<p>The weather is gradually getting colder, and the ants are busily searching for food to prepare for their winter. One day, Brother Ant found a dead fly on the ground and slowly dragged it back to the nest.</p>
<p>On the way, he met his former neighbor, the golden beetle.</p>
<p>"Hello, Brother Ant? Why are you so busy all day long?" the golden beetle asked smugly.</p>
<p>"Hey! Hello, Brother! The weather has been getting colder these past few days, so I'm looking for some things to eat in the winter," the ant said.</p>
<p>"Ugh! You're so silly! Look at me, running around all day with nothing to do, how comfortable! You're always working, you're such a fool, such a fool, haha..." The golden beetle laughed proudly for a while and walked away.</p>
<p>Brother Ant watched its back, shook his head and sighed, and continued to drag the food back to the nest.</p>
<p>The northwest wind grew stronger day by day, the leaves were all blown away, and no one knew what the outside situation was like. Brother Ant took advantage of the good sunshine to go out for a walk and met the golden beetle lying on the ground, unable to move.</p>
<h3>The Fox and the White Goose</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yizhi</p>
<p>One day, a fox was extremely hungry and walked to the riverbank. He saw a white goose in the river and wanted to eat it.</p>
<p>He tricked the white goose, saying: "Friend, I have good news for you: the birds and beasts had a meeting on the mountain the day before yesterday and decided that they should not kill each other from now on. Therefore, there is a celebration today on the mountain. I have come specially to invite you to participate. Come with me quickly!"</p>
<p>The white goose heard this and thought: "The fox is a famous trickster, this may not be a good intention." So it stretched its neck, looked ahead, and ignored the fox.</p>
<p>After a while, the fox said impatiently: "What are you looking at? Why do you keep looking and ignoring me? Are you going or not?"</p>
<p>The white goose suddenly showed a panicked look and said: "I see two dogs wagging their tails and walking quickly towards here!"</p>
<p>The fox was most afraid of dogs. When he heard that dogs were coming, he was extremely frightened. His body couldn't help but tremble, and he wanted to run away.</p>
<p>The white goose laughed: "Mr. Fox, didn't you just say that the birds and beasts have already decided not to kill each other from now on? Why are you still afraid of dogs?"</p>
<p>We can learn three lessons from the above fable:</p>
<p>One: To live in society, one must be honest. Deceptive methods cannot gain people's trust and will only lose one's own credibility.</p>
<p>Two: When hearing something, one must examine whether it is reliable and not believe it lightly.</p>
<p>Three: The white goose's distrust of the fox's words is the white goose's prudence; the white goose's use of a trick to test the fox's truthfulness is the white goose's alertness.</p>
<h3>Naughty Kid Beating a Dog</h3>

<p>Children's Creation</p>
<h3>A Letter to All the Children of the Nation</h3>
<p>— Wu Pinxian, Fifth Grader of Zhiben Elementary School</p>
<p>Dear children of the nation: Recently, the puppet bandit army has been invading Suiyuan, using many airplanes and cannons to attack day and night. The soldiers defending the land of Suiyuan, in the freezing weather, carrying long guns on their backs, holding big knives in their hands, not afraid of hunger and cold, not hesitating to sacrifice, are fighting with the enemy for the country and striving for glory for the nation. How should we admire and respect their spirit!</p>
<p>You must know that Suiyuan is not the Suiyuan of the Suiyuan soldiers, nor is it the Suiyuan of the Suiyuan people. It is the Suiyuan of the people of the whole country. Everyone should protect it. We children, although we are still young, cannot fight on the battlefield, but our patriotism should not lag behind others. We should also bear the responsibility of providing support in the rear. I hope that all the children of the nation will unite to aid Suiyuan, save the money for buying candies and toys every day, collect it together, and transfer it to the heroic soldiers at the front as their needs. I hope that children, from now on, quickly save money and take on our responsibilities! I won't write much more, goodbye! I wish you progress!</p>
<p>Sister Wu Pinxian respectfully on December 3,</p>
<h3>The Benefits of Reading Newspapers</h3>
<p>— Cheng Ming</p>
<p>Children: In addition to your daily schoolwork, you need to read more newspapers, because the news and articles published on the newspapers can increase your general knowledge and help the progress of your studies. For example, international news can help you understand the general trends of the world, domestic news can help you know the major events of the country and the various things in provinces, counties, and districts. Local news is related to the construction, finance, education, sports, and other important events in the city area. Moreover, the supplements of various newspapers have children's works, and you can exchange knowledge in children's works, which is a very beneficial and interesting thing! And the prices of various newspapers are also very cheap. In addition to cutting out the articles in the newspaper supplements and pasting them into booklets for reference, you can also sell the old newspapers to get a value equal to three-tenths of the newspaper price. If you want to save money and be economical, then there is a very good method that everyone can try. You only need to contact a few children and organize a small newspaper reading club. Each month, each person only needs to take out a few dimes to subscribe to several beneficial newspapers, and everyone can take turns reading them. That is a good and economical way to benefit a lot!</p>
<h3>Deep Sea Dream Diary</h3>
<p>— Jiang Zhongyu</p>
<p>(17) Min'er looked up and saw a large black fish with a light-emitting organ on its head swimming from afar. (18) He panicked and hid beside a seashell. (19) He saw the big black fish swim past quickly, and he felt a little relieved. (20) Suddenly, a fierce anglerfish came next. (21) After the two giant fish passed, another strange-looking wide-mouthed fish came. At this time, Min'er was so scared that he didn't dare to breathe!</p>
<h3>Filial Piety (10)</h3>
<p>— Hai</p>
<p>This was a joyful Easter Sunday. In that Greek chapel, all those with differing opinions had come to reconcile. When people met each other, Jide greeted them with a smile, saying, "Jesus Christ is risen." On the other hand, they also replied: "He is truly risen." Then they kissed each other, and even if there were any differences of opinion, they were completely forgotten at this time.</p>
<p>Berth Schofield was talking to Yi when he told him about his coming to plead for his father; that gentleman paid close attention to Yi and quickly introduced Yi to him, Yi told him about his coming to plead for his father. The gentleman paid close attention to Yi, showed great sympathy for Yi, but earnestly said to Yi: "It is useless to appeal to the Upper House; because even if Yi can get help from the Upper House to re-examine Yi's father's case, it will be very troublesome and time-consuming, and there is no guarantee that it will be overturned; so it is better to directly appeal to Emperor Alexander, if he is willing to show a compassionate heart, then the goal will be achieved."</p>
<p>Berth Schofield happily returned to the merchant, smiling and saying that this time it was really necessary to thank the Peter the Great statue, because if he hadn't looked at him at that time, Yi would not have noticed that the Neva River had thawed. At this moment, the merchant happened to return from Riga and knew that there was no progress in Berth Sfield's matter, so he immediately took Yi to see that Lord Ti, the lord was an old lady who received Berth Schofield very kindly and left Yi to live in Laili. But for several days in a row, the lord's residence was always holding lively banquets, everyone was playing cards, the old lord and the general guests had forgotten Berth Schofield's mission, poor Yi was always in the house every day, wandering around, very anxious in his heart, feeling that the infinite hope was afraid of disappointment. Yi remembered that the lord had advised Yi to see a Mr. Wei, who was the secretary of the Empress Dowager Mary and would definitely find a way for Yi. So the prisoner was taken to Mr. Wei's house, Mr. Wei happened to be not at home, but he already knew that Yi was coming to him, thinking that he was from a poor family and seeking Zhouji, so he left fifty rubles in advance for Yi to take back. Mrs. Wei saw Yi, and was very happy, listened to Yi's account of the past and present, was very moved, and kept Yi to wait for Mr. Wei to come back. After Mr. Wei came back, he knew about this and also expressed enthusiastic sympathy, and immediately rushed to see the Empress Dowager. Her old man was also one of the most gentle and charitable women in the world. Ordered Mr. Wei to bring Berth Schofield to see her every night. The poor girl turned pale when she heard the good news, and her eyes were full of tears. She didn't have time to thank Mr. Wei, and shouted to the sky: "My God, I have always trusted you, and it is not wrong in the end." At that moment, Yi kissed Mrs. Wei's hand and shouted; "Madam, you must accept my thanks, because your slave husband has saved my father!"</p>
<p>Berth Schofield didn't care what clothes she was wearing, nor did she care about the etiquette of meeting the Empress Dowager: Yi's simple heart only had the wish to plead for her father. Mrs. Wei only tidied up Yi's clothes and asked the prisoner to follow Mr. Wei. As soon as Berth Schofield saw the palace in front of her, she said happily: "If my father sees me now, how happy he will be! My God, complete your work!"</p>

<h3>Returning to Beijing Zhou from the Suiyuan Front Lines</h3>
<p>— Jingcha</p>
<p>Mr. Chong Jingzhou decided to go to the front lines to preside over the rescue of wounded soldiers in Suiyuan, without regard for the long journey and the hardships of swimming in the snowy weather. When he returned from the front lines, familiar people from the community went to visit him and inquired diligently about the situation of the wounded soldiers. Introduced by Ms. Hu Huiru, I also went to visit Mr. Pang. Mr. Pang was tall and burly, with thick eyebrows and big eyes, and spoke fluent old Beijing dialect. His kind and approachable attitude reminded me that I had also seen him during the "January 28th" Shanghai War, but I had not spoken to him directly. At that time, he and Dr. Ding Huikang worked very hard to serve the wounded soldiers fighting against the enemy in Shanghai.</p>
<p>"You must have worked really hard this time!"</p>
<p>"No, doctors are supposed to rescue people, especially the soldiers who are fighting for our nation!"</p>
<p>"How is the situation on the front lines?"</p>
<p>"You must have seen the talks I published in the newspapers. Looking at the current situation, I feel that rescue work is very important!"</p>
<p>"I heard that you want to organize a large-scale rescue team to go to the front lines again. When can it be realized?"</p>
<p>"This is the training class organized by the Training Promotion Association of the Rescue Cause Association. It can be said that it is entirely organized for the rescue of the wounded in Suiyuan. At the same time, there are many rescue classes organized by the outside world in the association that are stepping up training. Once they have completed the necessary knowledge, they will go to serve. But now the association has decided to do it themselves. Now we will set up a school first, temporarily located at Chengdu Road and Anxiao Elementary School. And the association has entrusted me with the responsibility of hiring teachers, and it will start in a few days. Now the admitted students have been notified separately."</p>
<p>"Are there any donations for the application of medicines and bandages, etc.?"</p>
<p>"This time is no less than the "January 28th"! As long as someone advocates or explains that it is a necessity, people will donate a large amount. When I just came back from the front lines this time, I just casually talked a little about the needs of the front lines, such as cold protection, anti-poison, etc., and in a few days, a lot of them had been collected and transported to the front lines. This has been reported in the newspaper, and I don't need to report the numbers again!"</p>
<p>"How much medicine and other things have been donated in total?"</p>
<p>"The association is organized with a drug supply committee. According to statistics, pharmacies in the city have generously donated about 130,000 first aid kits, which was just three or four days ago. In addition, many were sent directly to the Red Cross from various places. It's really impossible to count!"</p>
<p>"I think the rescue work at the front lines is probably very difficult, right?"</p>
<p>"Of course it is very difficult, but sometimes the inspiration of the spirit can overcome everything. Even in freezing weather, often below zero degrees, those engaged in work are still full of enthusiasm and do not shrink back and cannot do things. However, in order to strengthen the work, we pay attention to mental training and common sense issues in training rescue talents."</p>
<p>When he said this, he gave me a very strong impression. On his face, which still had the color of dust, the ruddy color shone through his yellow skin, and his thick black beard and eyebrows showed solemnity and majesty, but also extreme peace and calmness. I further asked him;</p>
<p>"What is mental training?"</p>
<p>"The work of rescuing the wounded on the front lines is completely different from the situation of peacetime nursing. The former is dynamic work, and the latter is static work. And it often contains full of danger and spirit of sacrifice! You must be calm, careful, deliberate and agile, and be able to adapt to the situation. From my own observation; if you train novices, you must first let him or her know some important wartime common sense. If you are rich in common sense, you will not panic and be at a loss, and then use the concept of the country, the nation, and saving the country to encourage the spirit of sacrifice and bravery of the staff!"</p>
<p>"I admire the machine! This is really the happiness of the soldiers fighting against the enemy on the Suiyuan front lines!"</p>
<p>"Not to mention that the soldiers fighting against the enemy can really have someone to take care of them carefully, even if they hear a word or two to encourage them, they are very excited and moved. This has already given us an experience during the "January 28th". This time we will certainly make every effort, but sometimes I am also very</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Encouraged by the spirit of the strong men who worked hard on the front lines. Therefore, I believe that the current spiritual training is just a necessary procedure. If the staff arrives at the front lines, I believe that they can get incredible encouragement in spirit!"</p>
<p>"I heard that the puppet bandits are so brutal and unreasonable that even the rescuers may be targeted as attack targets."</p>
<p>"I have heard of the incidents of attacking Christian churches and killing church members. As for the rescue work, because we had already expected this, we had taken precautions in advance, so nothing unfortunate has happened."</p>
<p>"Yes, the newspaper also published that the church minister Yi Shifang commanded the church members to open earthen cannons to resist the enemy, and received Mr. Fu Zuoyi's praise!" I then said; "The current war on the front lines has probably moved to the eastern part of Suiyuan, right?"</p>
<p>"Now the enemy is scheming to covet the Hsingho area. Because the northeast there is adjacent to Zhangbei Shangdu. Zhangbei is the base of the puppet bandits, and it is the same as the conquered Bailing Temple before. The enemy also knows that the base of our army is in Shanxi, and the southern part of Hsingho is directly connected to the Great Wall and the gateway to Shanxi, Tianzhen Yanggao, and Jining is also nearby. The enemy's northern invasion has repeatedly retreated, and it is already hopeless to enter Baotou, then there is only one strategy to attack Hsingho."</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I saw that there were already many visitors, so I said goodbye and left.</p>
<p>Book and Newspaper Introduction</p>
<h3>Introducing "War and Espionage"</h3>
<p>— Kanfu</p>
<p>——Written by Rowan of England, translated by Hu Yuzhi, published by Shenghuo Bookstore, priced at three jiao per volume——</p>
<p>The world is on the eve of a great war, the smell of gunpowder permeates the whole of Europe and the Pacific Ocean, as long as a person with a little common sense knows that the threat of the Second World War is getting closer and closer to us every day.</p>
<p>At this time, in addition to striving for military competition, countries are also enthusiastically engaged in espionage warfare. In order to spy on the military secrets of other countries, in order to understand the activities of other countries' diplomacy, they spend huge sums of money every year, and use various clever methods to organize their own spy network. Therefore, although the war between countries has not officially broken out, the espionage war has already begun. As a result, many countries are suffering from espionage panic. Not long ago, Singapore did not crack a large espionage organization? And our friendly neighboring country in the east also discovered the sex scandal of American military officers using women to spy on military intelligence? Even a large-scale German espionage organization has been discovered in the Soviet Union. All of this tells us; the active state of espionage before 1914 has reappeared today.</p>
<p>Precisely because our world is full of espionage activities, legends, memoirs, novels, and treatises about espionage in European and American countries in recent years have become the most popular popular readings. "However, most of the works, because they cater too much to the vulgar psychology, are often detective novels, and even mythologized, and completely lose the value of history." Comparatively, only the book "War and Espionage" written by Rowan of England is worth recommending.</p>
<p>This book has recently been translated by Mr. Hu Yuzhi and published by Shenghuo Bookstore as one of the World Knowledge Series. The content is divided into fourteen chapters. The first chapter is "Modern War and Espionage". In this chapter, he first explains the relationship between modern war and espionage. He believes that "espionage has become an indispensable thing in modern war." "The biggest difference between spies and the military is that the military can only operate in wartime, while espionage activities do not distinguish between wartime and peacetime." At the same time, he also pointed out that espionage activities are a moral contradiction in the current society, which cannot be resolved at present. The second chapter, "The Development of Modern Espionage Systems", mainly explains the development of the independent science of espionage since Steib, Bismarck's famous detective chief, started working in 1870. The third chapter explains the basic principles of espionage work. Chapters four, five, six, and three are dedicated to discussing the information work of spies, the methods of transmission, and the issue of female spies. The author is very familiar with the espionage activities during the European War. Every time he explains something, he cites many extremely moving stories in history to elaborate. For example, how Germany deployed spies in countries such as Britain and France during the European War, how countries such as France and Belgium used extremely clever methods to transmit information, how British spies explored the sunken enemy submarines in the deep sea, how the Allied countries intercepted the German military codes, and various secret communication methods. In his narration, it is like listening to a legendary story, which is not only full of interest, but also makes people extraordinarily thrilling.</p>
<p>However, it is not enough to simply explain the work of spies. Because there is espionage work, there must also be counter-espionage work. "The so-called counter-espionage, on the surface, is opposed to espionage, but in reality it is not. If spies are responsible for offense, then counter-espionage is responsible for defense. Offense and defense are not opposite but complementary." In other words, counter-espionage is the spy of spies, and it can also be said to be a higher-level spy. Therefore, this kind of spy is more important in the current countries. This is also an important tool used by various countries to prevent spies from other countries and protect their own secrets.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the seventh, eighth, and ninth chapters, the author talks about the counter-espionage system in great detail, such as the history, methods, and secret police of the establishment of the counter-espionage system, the examination of letters, and the moving stories of all counter-espionage before and after the European War, which makes us read and learn about the methods of preventing enemy activities. At least we can get a lot of help.</p>
<p>Chapter 10 talks about "Propaganda", which talks about the method of using spies to spread rumors and incite military morale. The author also cites the story of the Austrian army using rumors to defeat the Italian army during the European War, causing the entire army of 500,000 people to suffer great losses.</p>
<p>In the last four chapters, the author is used to describe many spies who shocked the world in recent centuries. The first is Steib, Bismarck's detective chief, the second is Napoleon's spy Schulmeister, and the other is two famous female spies during the European War. "Miss Doctor" and the dancer Mata Hari, and the other is a famous spy in history, such as Defoe, the author of Robinson Crusoe, and Taion, an eighteenth-century spy, and he also described some reckless spies and their jokes, which are very interesting.</p>
<p>The author of this book, Rowan, has a great research on espionage. The historical materials collected in the book are also quite rich and precise. It is very important to understand the development of modern espionage systems and international espionage activities. Mr. Hu's translation is exceptionally fluent, and reading it not only does not make people feel that they are reading a translated work, but also feels like they are reading a novel.</p>
<p>However, this book also has considerable shortcomings. First, most of what he talks about are stories before and after the European War, and there is no mention of the current world espionage war. Second, there is no description of the espionage situation in the United States and Japan. Third, his national concept is too deep. Although it has been cut by the translator, his exposure to imperialism's oppression of small and weak nations and other aspects is still not sufficient. Even so, this book is still very necessary for our current China. Because, we are currently facing a serious national crisis, and imperialism is playing a great role in our espionage activities. Therefore, espionage activities and counter-espionage activities for the purpose of national self-defense are also what we currently need very much. Because this is an unarmed combat organization, we should not give it up. The publication of this book will undoubtedly give us a great help and inspiration in understanding this issue.</p>
<p>Essays</p>
<h3>Street Art</h3>
<p>— Lu Ren</p>
<p>The art that people usually notice is the Western paintings, watercolors, sculptures, reliefs, prints, and woodcuts displayed in galleries or exhibition halls, not street art. Little do they know that there are also our artists working hard to create their artworks at street corners.</p>
<p>In those humble and narrow streets and alleys—not on the magnificent Nanjing Road—we often see a group of children huddled together, surrounding a peddler with a shoulder pole making sugar figurines. In the minds of those artists, in the minds of those art connoisseurs, it is never considered that outside the "palace of art" there is also this nameless art... However, for ordinary poor children and impoverished people, they have their own art. The sugar figurine peddler on the street is the artist in their minds.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, using the same sugar, except for very simple tools, he relies entirely on his hands to make dozens of different things. In the short tens of minutes I observed, he had already made a turtle, a snake, a frog, a dragon, and a bird. According to him, he can not only make butterflies, fish, clocks, abacuses, mice, and other commonly seen objects, but also various characters, such as Guan Gong, Zhang Fei, and the like, just like Guan Gong and Zhang Fei appearing on stage in current opera troupes.</p>
<p>Our street artist understands history better than those who study history. He knows what kind of clothes those characters should wear, what weapons they should carry.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>He also fully understands the facial makeup techniques of old operas, knowing who should have a white face and who should have a red face. In his works, each character has a specific characteristic in their facial expressions, eyebrow and eye positions. Putting two Guan Gongs together, it's simply impossible to tell which is which. He can also create beautiful modern girls, and he can also create young men in suits and leather shoes. He can do anything he sees. He can make airplanes, trains, and ships. It seems that whatever is invented in the world, a similar thing can be found on his carrying pole.</p>
<p>Moreover, he understands general child psychology to cater to the minds of countless children. The things he makes must be what children like in their hearts. He can immediately create whatever a child asks for without hesitation. He can deal with children. He is not afraid of many children disturbing him, hitting him, squeezing him, snatching his sugar figurines, or hindering his work. He does not get angry and can handle everything with ease. When many children are vying for sugar figurines, he can make them take their turns without arguing. On one hand, he has to rush his work, on the other hand, he has to prevent children from stealing things, and on the other hand, he has to guard against patrols or police officers who come to drive him away. This is truly a world apart from the artists who sit in the "palace of art" and create artworks in peace.</p>
<p>He also sets up a grinding disc at one end of his carrying pole, asking children to bet on winning or losing with a copper coin, and giving them sugar to eat whether they win or lose. A carrying pole serves as a table, a counter, and a seat. He is very happy at heart, making artworks all day long, and also being with those innocent and lovely children. He is also a favorite friend of the children. This is also different from those bookish artists who are often complaining about "boredom" and "suffering."</p>
<p>In less than five minutes, I watched him make two snakes. The color of the snakes was celadon green. He skillfully blended green and yellow sugar together, just like a painter mixing colors, to create the color of celadon green snakes. A flat, round piece of sugar was stretched out in the blink of an eye, resembling a real wriggling snake. The patterns on the snake were printed with a broken wooden comb. This wooden comb of his is naturally less valuable than the comb that a modern girl takes out of her purse on a tram, but it is much more useful. It not only makes the patterns on snakes, but also imprints the fingers of people and animals, and can also imprint hair. The utility of a broken comb is truly beyond expectation!</p>
<p>The snake is coiled on a piece of cardboard. The head is the most complex and also the most interesting, with whiskers coming out of its mouth and two sparkling eyes. He can not only make various individual animals, but also, like a painter, combine various animals to achieve balance. A frog is placed in front of the snake, and the snake is looking at it as if to bite it, while the frog is like the angry frog encountered by King Goujian of Yue on the road, showing an unwillingness to submit.</p>
<p>This street artist is like the great French writer Guy de Maupassant. The subjects he depicts are small, trivial, and commonplace, readily available. There are also artists like this who make small toys, paint advertisements, and perform tricks. They are truly folk artists.</p>
<h3>Vanguard of Aggression</h3>
<p>— Jin Yue</p>
<p>There are many people in this world that we would never expect, and this friend whom I met for the first time is one of them.</p>
<p>I met him at a friend's house. He had just collapsed on the bed to smoke opium. After my friend introduced us, he looked at me with his nearsighted eyes. Probably because my friend had said a lot about me in front of him, which made him feel that I was someone who deserved his considerable respect—in fact, I was just a poor man who was incapable and had nothing—he suddenly put down his opium pipe, pinched his nearsighted glasses with his fingers, looked me up and down, and then said loudly, "Oh! Mr. Jin, please sit down. When did you arrive? We were just talking about you! Please sit down, have some tea. Business in Shanghai is not good! We were just talking about you! Please sit down, have a smoke." He said so much in one breath. He wanted me to sit down, have tea, and have a smoke, completely forgetting that I was just one person and could not split myself to do so many things at the same time. Moreover, in that chaotic situation, I didn't know what to say in response. I could only take off my long gown and repeatedly say, "Okay, okay, you pour, don't be polite, you drink, you smoke."</p>
<p>As if responding to an echo, he actually did what I said. He sat up, drank a cup of tea, and then collapsed back down to smoke.</p>
<p>My friend said to him, "Mr. Jin has lived in Xiamen for a long time and has worked in the press. He recently came from Beijing."</p>
<p>As soon as Beijing was mentioned, my friend whom I had just met put down his opium pipe and said to me, "Beijing, the emperor's capital, there's the emperor's palace."</p>
<p>I love Beijing, and I also love talking about Beijing with others. I briefly described the magnificent scenes in the imperial palace to him. Finally, I mentioned the imperial gold seals. "Like square inkstones," about ten or so, all gleaming gold.</p>
<p>Gold is moving, and he jumped up from the bed, shouting, "Ten or so? My god, wouldn't that be over ten thousand dollars?"</p>
<p>"Yes, the big ones must be worth tens of thousands of dollars," I nodded and said. But he did not just nod, but also shook his head desperately. After shaking his head, he sighed and said, "Beijing! Look! Beijing!"</p>
<p>He wanted us to look at Beijing, but what to look at? Everyone who has been to Beijing loves Beijing. There is the prosperity of the city, and there is also the tranquility of the countryside. But in his mind, Beijing only has ten or so gleaming imperial gold seals.</p>
<p>From the conversation about the imperial gold seals of Beijing, I roughly understood the hobby of my friend whom I had just met. And in the pervasive smoke, I also roughly recognized his appearance: a pair of rat-like nearsighted eyes, and a few messy short whiskers growing under a face that was so thin that it could not be thinner, and slender fingernails stained with opium.</p>
<p>When he left, he enthusiastically invited me to his house to play, and even offered to spare a room for me to live in. I thanked him one by one. I also followed my friend to see him out and said goodbye. I would very much like to have a detailed conversation with him again and would like to know how he lives in this world. From my friend's conversation, I knew...</p>

<p>His surname is Wang, and he is the owner of a money shop.</p>
<p>Although he himself is very thin, he has a very fat mistress and a quite beautiful younger sister.</p>
<p>He also has several maids, who have now grown up and are very able to make money for Boss Wang. When the maids go out on errands, if there are wealthy customers, Boss Wang's mistress often follows behind.</p>
<p>Boss Wang is very good at helping the poor. People with financial difficulties can borrow money from his money shop. Borrowing one hundred yuan actually gets eighty-five yuan, with the remaining fifteen yuan as interest, for a period of one month, and one hundred yuan must be returned upon maturity. Boss Wang is a foreigner, and everything has backing. He is not afraid of people running away with his debts.</p>
<p>Boss Wang's residence is very spacious. The money shop is downstairs, and the mistress's bedroom is on the first floor. According to Boss Wang, because the second floor is a pity to leave empty, half of it is given to friends as a club. Friends gamble and smoke opium there, and Boss Wang can also get several hundred yuan in gambling commissions each month. The other half, it is said, is for the maids to play in. Boss Wang does not seem to care much about them, but when there are no guests to play with the maids, Boss Wang wants them to come to his room to smoke opium and make tea.</p>
<p>Therefore, Boss Wang is now very rich. According to what he himself tells people, he has close to ten thousand in assets.</p>
<p>A few days later, I saw Boss Wang again at my friend's house.</p>
<p>From his conversation, I also learned that he is a fan of gambling "Eleven Sticks." He said, "I dreamed of two pigs the night before, with two horns growing out of their heads, standing in front of my mother. Pigs are a black image, I bet on black image, bet ten yuan, and won."</p>
<p>I felt that Boss Wang would not tell lies. Someone like him should often have dreams. He would dream of demons eating people and also dream of wolves and tigers chewing his bones.</p>
<p>He said to people, "Bet! Starting from one yuan, one yuan wins ten yuan, then bet again, ten yuan becomes a hundred yuan, a hundred yuan becomes a thousand yuan, then bet again, a thousand yuan becomes ten thousand yuan, a hundred thousand yuan, a million yuan. Damn it, shut down all the twenty or so gambling dens in Xiamen, let us get rich."</p>
<p>One friend said to him, "If all thirty or so gambling dens are closed down, would Xiamen still be a good place to live? Each gambling den can at least support forty or fifty hooligans. Thirty or so gambling dens can support one or two thousand hooligans. If the gambling dens are all closed down, where will one or two thousand hooligans go to make a living? Your money shop might be in danger, and your women might not be able to take gold jewelry out."</p>
<p>Although this friend's political views are not very brilliant, our Boss Wang does not care about these things at all. He just says, "Bet! Everyone bet! Bet them into bankruptcy."</p>
<p>Boss Wang seems to have some past vendetta with these gambling dens. Later, according to my investigation, I learned that the original reason was that one gambling den refused to let him join as a shareholder.</p>
<p>One day, driven by curiosity, I actually visited Boss Wang with a friend.</p>
<p>In the money shop downstairs, I saw his fat mistress and his younger sister wearing a red cheongsam. On the second floor, I saw Boss Wang collapsed on the bed smoking opium.</p>
<p>As soon as he saw us, he immediately put down his opium pipe, invited us to sit down, and shouted loudly downstairs, "Hey! Brew a pot of tea."</p>
<p>We all sat down and talked a lot, but the tea had not yet been brewed.</p>
<p>"Hey! Brew a pot of tea, Tieguanyin, a lot of it. Buy two more chicken cakes and five bananas." Boss Wang continued to shout downstairs.</p>
<p>After five minutes, the tea and cigarettes still had not been delivered.</p>
<p>I thought that the mistress probably did not pay much attention to Boss Wang's instructions, and the maids upstairs just happened to be busy with business. There were sounds of playing cards upstairs, as well as the sounds of women and men laughing. Boss Wang would have at least a hundred or so dollars in income tonight.</p>
<p>But just as I was about to laugh, Boss Wang suddenly raised a question.</p>
<p>"Isn't it? Mr. Jin, I say that being a person requires benevolence, righteousness, courtesy, wisdom, and trustworthiness. We must believe in Confucius, Jesus God, Bodhisattva, and the Earth God, isn't it? Mr. Jin."</p>
<p>But at that time, I really could not answer this question to Boss Wang. In fact, Boss Wang did not need my answer, so I just asked, "What kind of dreams have you had these days, Boss Wang?"</p>
<p>Speaking of dreams, Boss Wang became even more energetic. He said loudly, "Yes, yesterday I dreamed of a pig again, unlucky, I forgot it as soon as it dawned, I waited until I opened the Eleven Sticks, it was a black image, then I remembered, really unlucky, I lost ten dollars yesterday, I can't win it back today."</p>
<p>"Oh! You dreamed of a pig again."</p>
<p>"Yes, strange, I often dream of pigs."</p>
<p>We seemed to talk a lot, but the tea and bananas still did not come. Boss Wang was probably angry because he needed to drink tea himself, so he was really angry. He knew that shouting for tea and bananas on the bed would not be effective, so he reluctantly got out of bed, pointed to the boils on his feet, and said to us, "Sigh! You see, two on the face, two on the feet, a total of four, boils, all boils, they hurt like hell, I didn't bring a flashlight last night when I went out, I bumped into a stone lion, it broke, and I bled two cups of blood, oh, it hurts like hell." Boss Wang said this and limped, limped to the head of the stairs, stretched his neck and shouted downstairs, "... Bananas!"</p>
<p>"I went to buy them, and I haven't come back yet! Why are you shouting so desperately?" The mistress was a little angry. So, Boss Wang, standing at the head of the stairs, remained silent for two minutes, and then limped to the bed, climbed up, and started smoking.</p>
<p>The tea and bananas were finally brought by the smallest maid. Boss Wang was angry at that moment. He took a bamboo strip and slapped the maid a few times, scolding, "You stinky x, x your mother, where did you go? Bastard." The tiger-like power was revealed in Boss Wang's short and messy beard. Boss Wang was indeed a bit heroic at this time.</p>
<p>After our intercession, Boss Wang finally let the maid go and went on to talk about his real business.</p>
<p>He asked me to do something for him.</p>
<p>According to Boss Wang, there was a sworn brother who did not care about morality and benevolence, and cheated his maid's jewelry to gamble. Heaven sometimes doesn't have eyes, and he happened to win money gambling, and he also bought a few maids to do business. Moreover, he happened to live next door to Boss Wang. According to Boss Wang, everything can be done according to the brotherhood and not be bothered with. It's just that these few maids are really stinky and cheap, and they often lure Boss Wang's friends upstairs over there, which makes it very difficult for Boss Wang. Because Boss Wang is very worried about his friends upstairs, these friends are very young, and if they are corrupted by those maids next door who Boss Wang thinks are stinky and cheap, wouldn't that be letting his friends down and losing faith? Therefore, he had to ask for my help. As for how to help, Boss Wang was confident about this. He said to me softly, "This is very easy for you, sir. He is not a real foreigner, and he has not obtained a license from the Chinese authorities. You just need to write a news report about him, and he will have to move away."</p>
<p>I suddenly realized that Boss Wang's tea and bananas were related to benevolence and righteousness. And at that time, I did drink Boss Wang's tea, so although I did not directly agree to his request, I could not help but wish him more accurate dreams so that he could win a few more rounds of Eleven Sticks.</p>
<p>In fact, Boss Wang did have a dream that night, but this dream was not a pig's head with two horns growing out of it, but a dog and a cat fighting.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, my friend said to me, "Boss Wang's mistress scolded Boss Wang a lot today because Boss Wang's dream was not accurate, which made her lose a lot of money."</p>
<p>Amateur Study</p>
<h3>What Insect Researchers Need to Know About Making Their Own Insect Specimens</h3>
<p>— Ziyun</p>
<p>I have a Western friend who is an insect expert, so he is very fond of making animal specimens for research purposes. On the four walls of his living room, there are almost all boxes of gorgeous butterflies, dragonflies, and many other kinds of beetles; everyone thinks this is more beautiful and meaningful than screen paintings and calligraphy. The following are the simple rules for making insect specimens that he told me.</p>
<p>Necessary tools: a pair of scissors, the tips of which should be sharp and straight, used to separate the various parts of the animal; a pair of tweezers, usually small and pointed, used to pick up objects, lest picking them up with fingers would cause contamination; a bug-stopping clamp; when sticking animals on the board, if you use your hands to press them in, it is easy to bend the pins, and when moving the specimens, it often damages the object, so use a bug-stopping clamp to hold the tip of the needle, either to pull it out or to stick it down, which is very convenient; a bug-catching net, used to catch insects; the net is two and a half feet long, the diameter of the mouth is half a foot, stretched with mosquito netting yarn, gradually shrinking from the diameter of the mouth into a conical shape, sew its mouth onto a steel ring, and install a wooden handle, four feet long, on the ring; two or three glass bottles, the most suitable being round with lids, containing a small amount of potassium cyanide, covered with a layer of cotton or cloth, which can be used as a poisonous bottle for raising animals; an insect-stabbing platform, made of wood, divided into two levels, each level has holes, which must be able to allow the insect needle heads to pass through; a set of wing-spreading boards, using a rectangular piece of wood, with the sides inward, leaving a groove in the middle, used to spread the wings of insects flat; if there is no such board, two rows of glass sheets can be stacked, leaving a groove in the middle; a humid insect container, using a large glass jar, containing about two inches of saturated moisture sand, and then adding a few drops of carbon disulfide and carbolic acid to prevent the growth of fungi; in the middle of the jar, place an iron wire mesh, and place the specimens to be taken to spread the wings on the mesh; if there is no such humid insect container, the wings of the insects will easily break, and the specimens produced will not be beautiful; in addition, some insect needles are needed. These tools can be made by oneself, and scientific instrument companies also sell them.</p>
<p>Necessary medicines: (1) Anesthetic, the most suitable being chloroform; (2) Preservative, alcohol is the best; (3) Antiseptic, camphor powder or camphor pills are the most commonly used.</p>
<p>The best time to make specimens is in late spring and early summer, because that is when hundreds of flowers are in full bloom and there are the most insects. Now I will try to divide the methods into several categories.</p>
<p>Regarding Lepidoptera, such as silkworm moths, swallowtail butterflies, nymphalid butterflies, etc., these are all, the specimens of this type of insect are exceptionally beautiful and interesting. To catch silkworm moths, you must go at night, first apply moth-attracting sugar on the bark of the tree, go to the tree under the light in the middle of the night, and you will see that there are many moths sucking on the sugar, so use a poisonous bottle to gently pick up the moths. After they are poisoned to death, use tweezers to clamp them out and place them on the wing-spreading board. The method is to put the body of the moth...</p>
