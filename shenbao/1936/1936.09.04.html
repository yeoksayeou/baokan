<p>時評</p>
<h3>粵漢路全綫通車都</h3>
<p>粵漢路全綫通車。巳於九月一日正式開始。以廣州武昌為南北兩終點。跨地三省。計長千里。而於四十四小時畢其行程。不可謂非快舉。將來與平漢鐵路接軌以後。則南北幹綫。直達無阻。謂縮地之無術。將以此為憑信。宏圖乍展。屬望彌殷。不待雙十節開幕盛典之烘託。而吾人今日欣抃之情。已有不勝共詡舒發皇者矣。</p>
<p>修築粵漢路之建議。猶遠在七十年前。幾經磋酌商洽。始克購料賦工。而集貲匪易。程作浩大。不得不藉逐步興修之程序。以徐圖全路工事之完成。當時就事實之所便。計分三段以策進行。在北為湘鄂路。在南為廣韶路。均經分別通車在先。唯中間株韶一段。以山嶺重疊。工程艱阻。懸擱延岩。迄十三年。迨至二十二年。鐵部始下决心。督促工事。銳意經營。限期雖有四年。而實際動工以來。祇兩年八個月卽吿完成。同一工程也。緩之則十三年而無成。念之則卅二月以集事。由是可知需為事賊。政在人為。誠令在位者痛下决心。任事者各自奮勉。卽何政不易措。亦奚事不克舉。泄沓因循者。一味諉卸責任。縱使委宛道來。亦適等於辭費而已。</p>
<p>基上所述。吾人以為此决粵漢路之全綫通車。不僅資交通以利便。不僅助長經濟文化之發展。其重大意義所暨。允在於顯示我國工程事業之進步。並以見任事者已能秉其果敢之精神。一洗已往泄沓之惡習。俾與民衆希望相接近也。蓋我國國民。狃執成見。對於官營事業。每持懷疑態度。非曰於己靡補。卽謂觀成無望。而官事之率意頓迥。亦誠多莫辭其咎。或則徒以文書功令相傳遞。或則專做紙面宣傳之文章。一事進行。動延歲月。不悟民智牖啟。遠非昔比。狙公伎倆。寧堪復用。自非以事實相標示。要難博人民之信仰。近數年來。各地公路建設。著著進展。多數人民。固已逐漸改其觀感。今株韶段復能以彈指之光陰。完艱巨之工事。共所以昭示人人者。寗直小補已哉。</p>
<p>由於粵漢路之完成。吾人復得返顧江浙間之兩大工事矣。錢塘江大橋之興築。滬杭甬全路之溝通。吾人在三年前卽已致其殷望。其後復一再著論鼓勵。佇觀厥成。迄於今日。雖尙未臻實現之期。而工事浩穰顯在積。極進行之中。據聞明年八月初旬。杭甬間必可通車。而錢江大橋亦可於雙十節前後竣工。藉當前之餘欣。策未來之展望。衷腸熱烈。殆難自抑。甚願主持共事者。更能以兼程之努力。促工事之早畢。俾得與粵漢路後先媲美也。</p>

<h3>如何保護農作物的益蟲（下）</h3>
<p>— 浙江大學農學院院長吳福楨</p>
<p>（乙）幼蟲寄生性的益蟲來講兩種：第一，我們在稻田中，常常可以看到稻螟蛉幼蟲的寄生蜂。這種蜂產卵於螟蛉蟲幼蟲的體內，孵化以後，就吸取螟蛉蟲體內的養液為食料，等到長成以後，就穿破螟蛉的體壁而外出，到稻葉上結成小形的黃白色繭而化蛹。這種繭常常數十個聚在一處，外觀好像一菜米粒，這蜂就是呌小繭蜂。今春各地秧出採卵，一般農人不如道牠是益蟲，都採下來弄死，實在可惜。牠撲殺螟蛉，據調查結果，一百條螟蛉幼蟲中有十八條是給牠寄生而死的，所以我們在田間看見了牠，切不要摧殘牠，應該任其自然繁殖。</p>
<p>第二，我們大家知道蒼蠅是害蟲，但是有一種寄生蠅却是益蟲。為害麥類及穀子的行軍蟲，（江蘇北部呌子蝗，河北省呌粘蟲，）常常被寄生蠅寄生而死。道種寄生蠅，當行軍蝨遷移的時候，常飛翔其左右而產卯於其體上，卯孵化為幼蟲後，就鑽入體內吸取養液而生長。凡被寄生的行軍蟲，都不能化蛹而中途死亡。我們在田中，如果看見行軍蟲背上附有寄生蠅所產的白色卵粒，不要以為行軍蟲是害蟲而隨意殺死牠，因為這種行軍蟲不用我們來殺死牠，寄生蠅產在蟲身上的卵，孵化為幼蟲後，已足致牠的死命了；否則把這種行軍蟲殺死，產在牠身上的寄生蠅卵，將來孵化為幼蟲後，因為寄主已死，牠也不能生存，結果打死一條行軍蟲，却損失了不少個寄生蠅——就是我們的助手。所以我們看到道種行軍蟲，不但不應該殺死牠，最好還要携回室中放在細孔的綠紗籠裏飼養，以便將來寄生蠅羽化後冉放人麥田，尋覓寄主——行軍蟲—再行產卯繁殖。</p>
<p>（丙）蛹寄生性的益蟲蛹亦有寄生蜂寄生，像稻螟蛉和稻苞蝨的蛹，在稻田中時常可以發現寄生蜂去寄生地。這兩種害蟲的蛹，一經寄生蜂寄生後，就不能羽化為蛾。所以我們採集到的蛹三繭，最好不要弄死牠，都放入有細孔的鉛絲籠中，等牠羽化後，仍能從細孔飛出，而沒有被寄生蜂寄生過的蛹化蛾以後，却因為牠的身體較大，無法飛出，而死於籠中了。</p>
<p>（丁）、成蟲寄生性的益蟲　蚜蟲繁殖力之强，在前幾天已經講過，所以至今我們的地球還沒有被牠完全佔據，雖然因為我們人類加以摧殘，但是總不及牠的各種天敵殘殺牠來得厲害。寄生蜂，我們上面已經講了好幾種，此地講的亦是寄生蜂——就是成虫寄生蜂。蚜虫雖然細小，但是還有比牠更小的寄生蜂能够產卵其體中。這種卵孵化以後，就在蚜虫體內吸取養料以生長，生畏成熟，就變為蛹，再化為蛾，穿破蚜蟲的體壁而飛出，另到其他健全蛛蟲身上去產卵。這種被寄生的蚜蟲，不容說是被寄生死了。</p>
<p>（二）捕食性的益蟲</p>
<p>（一）蜻蜓蜻蜓是一種肉食性昆蟲，牠專食動物質而不食植物質。牠的幼蟲—一就是水蔓，在水裏能吃蚊類的幼蟲——就是孑孑，帮助我們消減蚊類，牠成長以後，就各處飛舞，捕食各種蠅類及蛾類昆蟲；而在水稻田附近，往往特別的多，以致一般曼人以為蜻蜓在稻田上面飛舞，牠的尿撒在稻葉上會變稻苞蟲，把稻苞蟲的災害，歸罪於蜻蜓，這實在是一個極大的錯誤。我們知道蜻蜓能捕食螟蛾及其他稻作的害蟲，不但無害，其保護農作物的功勞實在偉大，我們應當竭力保護。絕對禁止捕段牠。許多兒童往往歡喜捕捉蜻蜓作玩物，這是應該隨時勸阻的。又如捕魚的時候，如果捉到了牠的幼蟲——水躉——就應該隨時放入水中，切不可任意殘殺牠</p>
<p>（二）螳螂　螳嫏也是一穢極大的益蟲。螳螂捕蟬是人人都知道的事，其實螳螂不僅捕蟬，其他一切害蟲都能捕食的，所以我們對於螳螂，也應當盡力保護，不可捕殺。螳螂的卵塊，就是標蛸，（遼寗省呌猴子，常州一帶呌拉尿郞）中藥店裏常用作藥材。牠的卵常產在樹技上過冬，我們除掉必要的時候要採作藥材外，切不可任意把牠傷害。</p>
<p>（三）步行蟲行軍蟲是一種極大的害蟲，各處的麥類及毅子，往往被牠肆意食害，釀成巨災。但是行軍蟲猖獗的時候，同時有一種步行蟲的幼蟲，亦盛行活動。這蟲有很大的鉗狀口器，專在田間吃食行軍蟲。牠道時東奔西走，簡直橫行無忌，無怪江蘇北都稱牠氣不憤了。我們的麥類及穀子，所以能得豐收，步行蟲實在也有一部分功勞，我們怎能不盡力保護牠呢！</p>
<p>（四）瓢蟲　蟲是各種作物極大的害蟲，前幾天我已講過，但是蚜蟲繁殖的地方，常有許多瓢蟲聚集，這瓢蟲就是專門捕食蚜蟲的。瓢蟲的種類很多，牠的背部光澤美麗，並且有二個，四個，十四個等不等的星，所以有二星瓢蟲，四星瓢蟲等的名稱。牠的形狀好像我們舀水的瓢，這就是稱棉瓢蟲的緣故。牠是肉食性的昆蟲，不吃植物質的東西，只吃蚜蟲等害蟲；所以我們要盡力保護牠。不過有一種吃害茄科械物的二十八星瓢蟲是害蟲，却不要保護，而應隨時隨地殺死牠的。</p>
<p>（五）蚜蠅　還有一種蚜蠅（食蚜虻）牠常常產卵於蚜蟲集居的植物上，這卵孵化為幼蟲後，就捕食蚜蟲為生。牠捕食蚜蟲的方法很特別，先把口器鑽人蛀蟲體內，然後盡力吸取其中的養液，養液吸完，再換一個，一直吸到飽為止，所以蚜羣中我們常常可以看見許多蚜蟲的空殼。牠的成蟲，好似蜜蜂，常飛翔於花叢中，我們切不可捕牠殺。</p>
<p>（六）蚜獅　蚜獅，亦是因為牠能捕食蚜蟲而得名的。牠的卵產在植物的葉子上。常常十幾個簇聚在一處，並且有絲狀的長柄托着，外觀很奇特。這卵孵化為幼蟲後，就捕食蚜蟲等害蟲。</p>
<p>以上幾種昆蟲，都是很有名的農作物益蟲，我們應當隨時隨地加以保護，切不可任意殘殺，</p>
<p>此外遝有一種蜘蛛，一般人往往認為益蟲，其實牠對於人類益是有益的，却不是昆蟲，不過和昆蟲很相近罷了。蜘蛛的種類很多，大都能够張網捕食害蟲，所以也應該保護的。今春有好多的地方實行秧田採除螟蟲卵塊工作，秧葉上有很多的蜘蛛卵囊，一般農人因為不認識牠，以為牠也是害稻的螟蟲卯塊，都從秧葉上摘下來弄死了，這實在是摧殘我們的天助，是件再可惜沒有的事。其實螟蟲卵塊和蜘蛛卵囊完全不同，卽拿牠們的顏色比較，蚊蟲卵塊是棕黃色的，蜘蛛卯囊是白色，就可分辨淸楚了。</p>
<p>田鷄，一般人也呌牠是益蟲，的確，牠能捕食農作物的害蟲，是有益人類，不過却不是昆蟲，並且已與昆蟲相差得很遠，這我們要弄清楚的。（完）</p>

<p>自九一八事變後，東北四省失陷，繼以冀東之自治，今春察北復不戰而亡，最近綏東又緊張萬狀，眼見國人注意之西北，又將繼東北而為國防之第一綫，思之痛心，記者奉館命，北行旬日，茲將在綏觀感所及，敬為國人述之，</p>
<p>綏遠地處　西北門戶，為山西·陜西·甘肅·寗夏·青海·新疆之屏障·北連蒙古，更為國境之管鑰，在國防上佔極重要地位，惟地勢平坦，無險可守，自庫倫外向，百靈廟事變之後，綏遠之處境更為困難，而況自冀東以至察北，自察北以至綏東，為侵略者　已定之計劃，故冀東準備略定，卽發生察北事件，察北準備略定，卽發生綏東事件，明眼人固一望而知之也。</p>
<p>大抵侵略之道，最上者為利誘歸順，利誘不成，則加以威脅，威脅不成，則分化內部而加以騷擾，如再不成，則方用實力以征取冀東察北之事，卽此三部曲之奏演，綏東之事亦猶是也，惟有一點可明告國人者，依最近之情勢觀察，則三部曲之奏演已失其功效，而使敵人不得不實施最後之途徑，綏東近況雖甚安靜，惟安靜之時期愈久，則危險之程度愈高，斯則凡我國人均當加以深切之注意，執政者更應深思遠慮　及早預防者也。</p>
<p>記者抵歸綏之日，適綏東四旗剿匪司令達密凌蘇龍氏亦到綏，同寓綏遠飯店，蒙胡鳳山先生之傳譯，以身歷其境之人，暢談綏東事變，據云此事發生於七月三十日，是日有匪軍數百人，進窺陶林，經民團擊退後，卽向商都遁去，八月二日復集眾數千人，再度來　犯，與我部正式接觸，相持數日，不支而退，此後彼方乃知騷擾之不可能，迄今正在準備大舉，故尚未敢來犯，據云察北來犯僞軍，德王原有之蒙隊約千餘人，李守信部千餘人，卓什海部千餘人，包悅卿包貴卿王英等共合數千人，總計約在萬人左右，惟多烏合之眾，故抵禦尚不甚難，此後匪軍　準備充足，匪軍之幕後　又有强大之助力，則防守之事，極難言矣，達氏為人豪爽，談論戰事，愛國之心，溢於言表，可佩也。</p>
<p>記者又訪　傳作義主席於省府，省府處歸綏新城—卽綏遠城，在舊城—卽歸化城　之東北約四五里，公路建築，整斉寬大，綠柳成陰，空氣清爽，省政府合署辦公敬肅而美觀，當蒙省府秘書　陳崇德先生之介紹，卽承接見，為談綏東事變，興奮異常，是晚並蒙設宴相招，特約潘王，康王，榮總管，巴總管，及達司令等相會，諸王均略能漢語，而歸化土默特　特別旗榮祥總管，更精通漢字，座間談笑風生，頗多樂趣，大抵綏遠全省，自傳主席以下，對綏東匪變，俱有抵抗之決心，綏境人力財力，兩俱缺乏，惟在埋頭苦幹之下，全境人民，俱能各盡其國，其結果雖不可知，而一般之現象極可欽佩，所望中央當局，無負苦心，全國民眾，予以援助，為國保英才，守疆土，使此西北之屏藩，不再淪為夷有，家家復興之前途，庶有豸乎。</p>
<p>綏遠商業，自庫倫路斷，新疆道阻，各地交易，日就蕭條，省政府每年總收入僅一百四十餘萬，其窮苦可知，記者在途中遇天津交通銀行行長徐柏園君，亦方在西北視察分行及各地方經濟狀況，據云今春天旱，農產歡收，西北以農物物之輸出為大宗，故開發西北，先以改進西北水利為最要，誠至言也。</p>
<p>記者又曾赴昭君墓一遊，墓在城南二十餘里，出城，道路崎嶇，步履維艱，公路以沙地築成，尚未工峻，行十餘里到黑水河，河架以橋，而水不盈尺，所謂黑水青塜，卽指此處，過橋後，一片平沙，間以綠草，極目四望，惟視烏雲洶湧，想見當年昭君出塞悲壯之氣，行片刻抵墓，墓前樹碑凡八，以道光十一年之「漢明妃塜」為最古，墓高十餘丈，登墓蹤望，一片平原無際，天蒼蒼，地茫茫，正是一坯黃土，長埋艷骨，誦杜詩「一去紫臺連朔漢，獨留青塜向黃昏，」之句，不禁與無限之感慨也。</p>
<p>記者留綏僅一日，而返館後綏遠之印象永留腦際，願我國人，慎毋忘此國防之前綫也。</p>

<h3>海利輪開船時　撞壞三駁船　兩水手帶纜被鉅浪捲去</h3>
<p>招商局海利輪、昨日上午九時、在滬裝齊貨物旅客解纜開赴靑島、時正漲潮之際、該輪甫離碼頭、向前進行、而船頭前忽有小輪五艘、</p>

<h3>人力車同業公會　條陳不能减車理由　函請各華董向工部局交涉</h3>
<p>特區人力車同業公會、因工部局近又提議减少人力車輛、故條陳理由、函各華董交涉、茲分誌群情如下、</p>
<p>函各華董　請求交涉</p>
<p>該會昨致函公共租界工部局華董虞洽卿·江一平·郭順·奚玉書·徐新六、等請求向工部局交涉、免予减少、原文云、敬啟者、竊查工部局前以人力車務委員會、建議减少人力車數一案、敝會會臚陳理由、函請援助、嗣該案業經决議保留在案、仰見諸公維護華人商業、關懷貧民疾苦之至意、佩甚佩甚、茲聞工部局方面、又有提議减少車輛之說、似有不達目的不止之意、聞之不勝駭異、謹臚陳三點於後、（另錄）綜上所陳、人力車輛、關係於社會需要及貧民生計、至為重鉅、工部局無論直接取消人力車輛、間接限制車夫人數、以淘汰人力車辦法、均非所宣、務懇諸公為社會前途及貧民民計着想、賜予據理力爭、以打消减少車輛之提議、則車業幸甚、社會幸甚、臨頴不勝屏營待命之至、</p>
<p>不能减少　理由三點</p>
<p>該會條陳不能减少理由三點、計（一）减少人力車輛、原為工部局之一貫政策、幷會於一九二四年、决定每年减少五百輛、至一九一五年减至五千輛之議、但此項政策、迄未實行者、乃實行此項政策、有背於事實、蓋今日賴人力車為生者、達數十萬人之業、當此市况蕭條之秋、一旦車輛减少、社會陡增數萬失業羣衆、殊非社會之福、而今日上海賴人力車運輸代步者、的一百餘萬人、雖機車之發達、亦不足以供全市市民之乘用、是减少人力車、影響於社會需要、更為重大、且政業基於人情與事實、不合人精與事實之政策、固無堅持實現之必要、此為社會需要計、為貧民生計計、車輛之不可减少者一也、（二）關於人力車輛阻碍交通問題、查近十年來公用人力車幷未增加、而在此期間、自用人力車、幾增至二倍以上、現有通行租界自用人力車二萬餘輛、比租界公用人力車較多一倍、工部局不謀限制自用人力車、而徒然主張减少公用人力車、殊屬不解、且限制或减少自用人力車、其影響每車僅於一人、而因此失業之少數車夫、公用人力車、足以容納之、而公用人力車、影響於廣大之乘客羣衆、及多數車夫之生計、一旦减少車輛、則無法解决此廣大失業羣衆之生計問題、且就事實言、道路交通之受人力車阻碍者、遠不及電車及公共汽車之甚、工部局獨縱此而欲去彼、殊令人奐測高深、此就交通言、人力車輛之不可减少者二也、（三）人力車每年納捐數達二十餘萬元之多、較諸公共汽車及電車等專利事業之納捐額、超媧達三分之一、對於市政當局之義務、不謂不大、且人力車關係於社會前途、至深重鉅、為市政稅收計、為社會前途計、人力車輛之不可减少者三也、</p>
<h3>實部令飾　推廣種植番薯</h3>
<p>實業部訓令上海市社會局云、案查前准行政院秘書處函、以奉李振漢呈請、令飭各省積極種植番薯、以謀解决全國糧食間題一案、應交實業部酌核辦理等因、抄同原件、函達查照等由到部、除函復外、經抄發中央農業實騐所核議、茲據呈復、以番薯作物、種植便利、生長極易、旣可作菜羹佐食、及代替米麥充飢、且可用作製酒精原料、處此非常時期、為預籌糧食自給、及液體燃料自給計、推廣種植番薯、實為要圖等情、經核尙屬切要、除分令外合、行抄發李振漢原呈、仰轉飭所屬各農事機關、提倡番薯、並首先從事該項作物育種試騐及推廣優良品種、俾可改進生產為要、此令、部長吳鼎昌、</p>
<h3>颶風吹坍房屋　李金根全家幸免</h3>
<p>滬西虹橋鎭西首李家塔農民李金根家甚貧苦、所居瓦屋五間、年代已久、頹廢不堪、詎昨日下午二時許、狂風暴雨之際、屋中忽然軋軋作嚮、李全家驚惶無措、向外奔逃、未幾、果嘩拉一聲、該屋全部坍倒、幸時在白畫、人畜均未捐傷云、</p>
<h3>為調整中國佛敎會　告全國僧尼（續）</h3>
<p>— 張廷灝</p>
<p>（一）僧尼必須入會和居士不得入會的規定</p>
<p>人言入會與吾、應隨僧尼的自由、殊不知該會為特殊的宗敎團體、不有組織則已、要有組織、必須强令全國僧尼加入、方可整飭敎規、逐漸養成中國佛敎徒的特殊精神、為護敎救國的準備、况且、律師公會和會計師公會等、早已都有强制入會的規定、倘使說事實上有困靴、那總理早有遺訓、「能知必能行、」知而不行、這是並非眞的不能行、是沒有誠意去行罷了、「誠」是做佛敎徒的基本條件、豈有做了佛敎徒而尚不知「誠」的道理呢、至於居士不得入會、這是並非不准居士做佛敎徒、要知道佛門七衆、其證果原有不同、其地位亦自有別、况且章程軍案中、居士還有被聘為擅護的規定、則居士雖不得人會、而護持佛法的義務、還是絲毫沒有妨碍、或者有人說、「被聘」兩字、似乎有待遇不公之嫌、其實這兩字、就正面稅正所以鼓勵居士熱心護法、就反面說、正所以防止掛羊頭賣狗肉的野心份子、來混入佛敎會、或者還有人說、僧尼沒有辦事經騐、所以非有居士加入不可、那就是僧尼自願永久處於被動地位、永久不願增進其辦事才能、實行自治、况目按諸律儀原則、居士本不能直接管理佾事、佛說「有願必成、」僧尼如果不願住持佛法、那又何必要佛敎會呢、</p>
<p>（二）開除僧尼會籍和勒令還俗的規定</p>
<p>國有國法、敎有敎規、法規不嚴、則基礎不固、所以犯法當誅、違規豈可不懲、况且懲一儆百、對被懲者說、似乎不仁、對整個佛敎和全體僧尼說、未始非仁、僧尼之所以能稱僧寳、就是在能够嚴持戒律、僧尼如果能够遵守會童和敎規、無過無愆、人方尊敬之不暇、那又何必怕受懲戒呢、</p>
<p>（三）寺庵收支的監督和財政公開的規定</p>
<p>寺庵財產、本是十方的公產、住寺者有保管整理的義務、沒有認為私有的權利、况且出家人不得私蓄財物、是佛門戒律之一、身為住持、豈可知戒犯戒、至於監督收支、在會是實行自治、為整頓的初步、在政府為固有的職權、敎產的用途、原為供養僧尼脩持、從事宏法利他、住持如果用得其當、無私無弊、那又何必怕監督收支公開財政呢、（未完）</p>

<h3>寫給肺病患者之忠告！</h3>
<p>— 沈兆荃醫師</p>
<p>肺病為頑固難治之惡疾、非一朝一夕之療養。即可痊癒。須長期脫離社會。專心療養。方可竟達全功。故欲戰勝肺病。將其治癒。患者必須有大無畏之精神。養成長期間之勇氣及忍耐力。此實為治愈肺病之重要的關鍵。而世之死於肺病者。大都非死於病之本身。乃由於長期間自尋無謂之煩惱。心身困憊。因之死者。</p>
<p>肺病須長期間之療養。故每不　免思及活動社會。思及健康之世人。而咒詛世界。艷羨他人。以為世人皆健康。而自獨染肺病。心懷不平。此雖為患者所常有之不平不滿現象。而此不平不滿之煩惱。確能妨害精神之安靜。而促成强度之神經衰弱則夜不能安眠，食慾减退。續發各種障礙。不但使病不易早愈。而且不免病勢增惡。故治療肺病之第一步。卽應達觀一切。超越環境。修養精神。最為當務之急。</p>
<p>患者如有百折不撓之忍耐及沈勇之毅力。從事修養。同時再圓增進其體內之生理上的防禦作用（卽抵抗力）。而發揮其自然治癒之機能。由此而病變部之進行性者得變為停止性。熱度减退。痰咳减少。自然元氣旺盛。精神爽快。對於治癒。可有無窮希望。</p>
<p>世之患肺癆者每惶駭憂懼。惴惴然如末日之將至。實則於適當之時期。謀積極之治療。全治可期。惜乎病者多昧於醫藥常識。初時或忽焉不察。放任不治。或用藥不當。誤入岐途。卒至不治。堪為太息。就今日之醫藥進步狀況言。肺病已有效之療法可施。近據各國肺病療養院所稱。德國新出「肺活」Phith　Weal　一藥。用以治療一二三各期肺癆（肺結核）確有著效。倘患者按法服用。同時并注意衛生。忍耐堅定。作長時期之療養。而獲痊癒。重登健康者。竟能達至百分之九十五人云。</p>
<p>按「肺活」Phith　Weal　之成分。係採取壯健動物新鮮肺與脾臓中提出之。內分泌素—荷爾蒙—混合製成之內服液。其效用能使已衰萎之肺臓機能—返弱為强—促進其防禦力。而使生理的自然治癒之機能旺盛。如組織缺損（卽肺有空洞之處）者得以填補之。同時在病部之周圍。築成鞏固結締織之牆壁。使之硬化。促其疤痕之結合。完全包裹惡魔之結核菌（癆菌）。禁其活動。終必使其完全消減。以至痊癒。故患者於服用「肺活」Phith　Weal　之後。不數日卽感覺精神爽快。食慾增進。咯痰稀鬆。咳嗽减少。血痰，潮熱，盜汗，皆見消失。並能於極短期內達到完全治癒之望。因而世界學者均一致推獎「肺活」為最合理且切實有效之肺病內服治療劑也。</p>
<h3>男女青春期的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 李志榮</p>
<p>生殖器的機能障礙</p>
<p>嫩綠的葉子，發出來的時候，在活潑的青年的內心裏潛伏着人們所不知道的苦惱…日夜悶憂着；而最使元氣旺盛的青年所苦惱者，恐怕是生殖器的機能障礙吧！</p>
<p>什麼是生殖器機能障礙？在男子一方面的，大槪是陰莖短小，腎萎，早洩，夢遺，漏精等症。在女子一方面的，為性慾異常，快感缺乏，性交時的痛苦，同時并發現月經不正（行經前後的腹痛，經期不是超前就是落後，經水過多或者過少，甚至於經閉不行）帶下頻多等症候。無論夫妻任何一方，若患生殖器機能障礙諸病的結果，定能破壞其家庭的幸福，而演成種種的悲劇…………</p>
<p>患生殖器機能障礙的人，同時并有極屬害的精神的煩悶，終日苦惱，鬰鬰不樂，意氣消沉，减退氣力，如此即逐漸陷入劇烈的神經衰弱的狀態；頭重，眩暈，頭痛，失眠，耳鳴，疲勞倦怠，記憶力减退，精神不安，腰背部庱痛，总而言之，是成了一个百病纏身！毫無生氣的廢人。羅患生殖器機能障礙者大多數是先天虛弱和神經質之人。其主要的原因；即無論男女，多犯過過度的手淫，因而陷入此不幸的病症。又有因為房事過度，或在花柳病經過之後，或出於身心腦力的過勞等，而致發生此症的，也確實不少。</p>
<p>關於生殖器機能障礙的治療方法，依據各專科醫師的經驗，欲挽救男性的生殖機能障礙，宜服用德國內分泌製劑「還爾童」WELL　TONIC女性障礙和月經不正，宜服用「美媽寗」MENORRIN這兩種藥品，用以治療男女兩性的生殖器機能障礙都很有驚奇的效果，如其依着本身的癥狀，經過相當時期的服用，其機能上的障礙一定可以除去，自然就能營正常的夫婦生活了。</p>
<p>神經衰弱！是毀減吾人生命力的惡魔；在治療上應與生殖器機能障礙同等看做一個重要的問題。所以在治療生殖器機能障礙的時候，必須并用滋養强壯神經的藥劑，各國醫師都推獎「米美爾補腦汁」MEMORY　NEUROTIC有返弱為强的權威。本劑不限男女，都可服用，普通連服用二三星期後，就顯出昭著的效果；精神活潑，元氣倍增，頭腦明晰，心志爽快，思想靈敏，食慾亢進，全身的健康狀態自然恢復了。</p>
<h3>哮喘病根治問題</h3>
<p>— DR.　W.R.　CHIYLON　M.　D.作　沈兆荃醫師譯</p>
<p>氣喘又名痰喘。自古難治。按本病之發生。往往始於小兒時。其初起出。易受風寒。常發鼻粘膜炎發　蔓性氣管支炎有類鼾聲。笛聲。及呼吸困難諸症。久則發為定型性之哮喘。此種小兒。身體常　瘦細長。其胸部發達。不甚良好。然往往至發育完成。廿歲前後。而哮喘宿疴。消散若失。倘過此而不愈者。將終其身為不治之患矣。亦有至老年始見者。四十五十歲之人。始發哮喘。積滯終身者。此例亦為多見。哮喘之癥狀。以高度呼吸困難為主徵。其發作恒以夜間突然而至。氣息阻　。不能就枕。或坐或立。以舒其氣。顏色蒼白或青紫。發作回數。多寡不一。時間亦長短不一。有一星期發數次者。有一二年中發一二次者。有發作一二時即愈者有一夜或數日而後愈者。甚至呼吸困難之苦惱。積留至數星期不去者。大多數之氣喘患者。因體力不健。對作業問題。頗感苦惱。如不設法治癒。則終身受慮。</p>
<p>哮喘之療法。從前因無完美之藥物。故皆認為極難要治。即臨床醫家。對於本症亦感束手。往往於發作時。亦惟藉麻醉劑（嗎啡鴉片）等暫時緩解其痛苦而已。惟此等麻醉劑不宜常用。因恐有中毒之虞耳。市間販賣之氣喘藥。大多數含有麻醉劑。雖能立刻生效。但有成癮之弊。病家如採用此等藥品在家自療。更為危險。、</p>
<p>茲有德國最新發明之氣喘根治特效內服藥「哮立平」Holipin依據各國醫師實騐之結果。對於小兒或老年之各種氣喘。均有治愈可能。若用於發作時，衹需吞服二至三片。大抵十分鍾即得平喘之效。以後在閒歇期若績服半打至一打。定能解除復發之苦。且「哮立平」Holipin之藥性和平。其成分中絕無絲毫麻醉劑。故宜久服。不生流弊。是以各國醫師公認本品為根治氣喘之安全內服劑也。</p>

<h3>紅白痢疾</h3>
<p>— 俞琦錫醫師</p>
<p>—癥狀及療法—</p>
<p>痢疾有菌痢及虫痢之別。其病狀—在急性者。便數增頻。衰急後重。便中多粘液而帶血色。下腹丙旁或全部發疝痛。全身違和。胃口不開。有時尚發寒熱及頑固之嘔吐呃逆。若病重則四肢厥冷。身出冷汗。眼窩凹陷。臉色，唇色，爪色皆變紫。顏容苦悶。心跳微弱。脈搏幽細。此為高度中毒之象。又在小兒。往往致項筋强直。全身痙攣。人事不省。茍治理稍遲。則生命甚為危險。</p>
<p>治療法—病起時。可餓一二天。一切飲食均不宜進。服用「敵腸痢」藥片Dysetrin　Tab.一日三回，每回吞服三片。連用三四日。輕病可治癒。重症轉輕。則需七八日。方可痊治。於治療期內之飲食。應非常謹慎。衹可用牛乳及薄粥等。嚴禁生酸不消化及含油質之食物。肚腹須注意保煖。不可受寒。</p>
<h3>女子春情發動期</h3>
<p>— 陳杏芬女醫師</p>
<p>易起之疾病</p>
<p>……應注意其治療…</p>
<p>女子之春情發動期。其身體及精神上。有一大變動。易起諸病。特如隱伏其體內之傳染病及遺傳病。皆於此時發生。尤以肺病，萎黃病（俗名女兒癆）及精神病（希斯的里）為最多。其他如月經不調緒症。亦所常見。</p>
<p>於春情發動期之女子。若有潮熱，虛汗，咳嗽，食慾不振，身體消瘦，月經不見等現象者。斯為肺癆之微。即宜服用「肺活」Phith　weal　使其早愈。不可治之過晚。以免延誤病機。</p>
<p>萎黃病之現象。為身體瀠瘦，顏色蒼白，無血氣，糦神頹唐，食慾減退，月經閉止，四肢乏力，耳鳴，目花。其療法須服補血强壯劑「康氏生活素」Conbour's　San-Cell及調理月經之專劑「美媽寗」Eenorrin兩種藥品。則能使氣血旺足。子宮與卵巢等生殖器機能健全。月經正常。恢於健康。</p>
<p>精神病—希斯的里—之病狀。大抵性情異常。（忽而狂歡，忽而憂鬰）喜怒無定。嫉妬心深刻。容易生氣。并發腦神經衰弱各種癥狀。如頭痛，失眠，眩暈，記憶减退，胸部苦闷，全身疲劳等现象。本病之疗法。须服用滋养神经之補剂「米美尔補脑汁」Memory　Neuratic　可鎮靜安神。强身壯體。對於衰萎之神經。能恢復健全活躍。上述各種病態。均見消失。而精神愉快。更顯青春健美之槪。</p>

<h3>淋病指迷</h3>
<p>— 上海海寗路克能海路口市民療養院編述</p>
<p>慢性淋病的</p>
<p>—根治秘訣—</p>
<p>患了淋痛的人。若在急性的時候。就應該加意衛生和施行正規的治療。不要把牠轉成慢性。倘是已經成了慢性的時候。更加要注意攝生。積極治療。終要知道剷草要　除根。醫治淋病。也要這樣。才可以沒有後患呢。若要淋病斷根。就該注意下面的攝生和療法。</p>
<p>注意攝生</p>
<p>（一）應當安靜避去各種的運動。譬如跳舞·騎馬·乘脚踏車·游泳·遠途旅行等。都是要注意避免的事情。（二）飲食的注意。應當忌酒頹·汽水·香味和辛辣等有刺戟性的食物。倘是吃了之後。往往能使淋病增惡。宜食用牛乳·粥·茶麥等。多喝些開水。到是有益的。（三）禁止交接。不論在急性或是慢性的淋病患者。都不可以行房事。倘若一經過了房事之後。非但要傳染給妻子的危險。本來是轉好的淋病。忽又凶惡起來。並且還有發生睪丸炎的痛苦。所以要極力節慾才好。（四）大便應當每日通順因為大便秘結。也容易使淋病增惡。</p>
<p>正規治療</p>
<p>淋病怎樣可以醫治斷根。實在是病家所渴望的一件事。然而市上販賣的淋病的服藥。種類之多。實有令人無所適從之憾。但是那些淋病藥中有着治療實效的。百不得一。雖然說得天花亂墜。大都是名不符實。劣藥欺人而已。所以病家擇藥。也是一個極難解决的問題。所以。淋病是否能根治。那就要看你用的藥是否適當為標準了。</p>
<p>現今於治淋內服藥中。依據病家的證明和醫師的報告。要算是『九一餘白濁片』“918”Anti-Gono-Tab。的功效最可靠。因此藥的配製方法合成方。都與別種藥完全不同。</p>
<p>，牠有强力透膜殺菌的功用。但是對於人體是絕對無害。服用之後。就吸收到腸之粘膜內。旋至膀胱變為强力殺菌性之尿。將淋菌隨殺隨排。所以不致傷害胃和腎臟。并且見效頗速。患者不論是急性或是慢性的淋濁。如其得受此正規之治療和攝生。在經過相當之時期。一定可以達到醫治斷根的希望。因此。『九一八白濁片』已得國際醫學界的推獎。一致公認道是淋病內服治療的特效劑了。</p>
<h3>青年之危機的遺精！</h3>
<p>— 章元楨醫師</p>
<p>遺精多由艷夢而起。如春情發動之青年。難與婦人交接者。或血氣已壯。尚未娶妻者。或在他鄉。不能與妻同衾者。易犯之。其他有因濫行手淫。房事過度而起者。特青年之人。每以妄起淫念。亂行手淫。釀成此症。其結果至精神衰頹。頭腦暈眩。耳鳴。頭痛。失眠。腰背酸痛。四肢乏力。面容枯瘦。毫無生氣。若不早治。或醫治不當。終至虛弱癆療而亡。</p>
<p>遺精之療法。必須節制情慾。禁用刺戟性之飲食物。避免身心過芝勞。止遺藥品。宜服用「福郎」固精片Folan　Tab於夜間臨睡之前。吞服二至三片。頗有著效。大都衹服一二瓶。即能全愈。對於腎虧所引起之衰弱諸症。當用强精劑。「還爾童」Well　Tonic有防止衰老。挽救虛弱之權威。</p>

<p>申報文藝專刋丹容巴葛躑躅  稜磨　　到星加坡第一步所踐踏到的地方是丹容巴葛。但我第一次過丹容巴葛却經過得那樣意外的匆匆。一切在船上所擔心的行李的搬運的困難，檢查的麻煩，路途的不認識等等，却被絕未擔心到的水警局的拘押極簡便地解决了。这次我除踏到第二十二號碼頭的一部份外，沒有踐到丹容巴葛的寸土。到後來知道，二十二號碼頭，且正只是丹容巴葛的邊際。　　再到已是半年後，隨着人送朋友返唐山，再後送人去荷屬，送人去歐洲，對這碼頭已逐漸熟悉。也許因為與所送的人，多沒有深切的友誼，也許因為別離會聚，由交通的便利，在近代已變得極其平常，全沒有在這碼頭上感到一點黯然銷魂的境味，却轉在這裏看出都會的最基本的活動的倥惚。二十二座碼頭，可泊萬噸以上的輪船十隻以上，有時竟全被大大小小的輪船擠滿。在岸上，碼頭區域以內也擠滿了人，從上帝的選民到造剩下的人類，一時俱集。那種熱鬧的情形，和四週比較起來，幾乎是兩個世界。背後空塲上疎落地豎着油池；右手延長出的海峽邊專用碼頭上比顯出冷落；對面聳立着靜寂的荒山；左面一片狹長的淺灣，灣口擱着一條破船，灣東一排半駕水上的原始式馬來居宅。不知道那些居宅內過簡單生活的居民，時對着鄰近的近代文明的威脅，又起怎樣的感想。　　因為去馬六甲海峽沿岸一所在的原故。我曾經三五次經歷丹容巴葛及巡西各碼頭的全程。大的中段以西，就間或兩岸都有碼頭。峽中最狹處相距不過數丈，而世界班，歐亞班的數萬噸巨輪，這裏都能通過，可說是天然的良港。先前不是葡萄牙人竭力把梓着馬六甲港，英人也許未必努力來發現這新港，不料一偶然的發現，竟逐漸形成東西交通上的重鎭，而使馬六甲的地位一落千丈。這是英人有可贊美的眼光呢，抑或僅是機會？　　峽中的碼頭，論位置當比丹容巴葛更好，不過却離市面太遠。丹容巴葛則緊靠市面的西南。位於新加坡河兩岸的市面，地位確是海岸一帶比較圾平坦的。丹容巴葛及以西各築碼頭的地方，都只是闢山塡海而成，斷續還留存着許多未剗小丘，所以在岸上各碼頭問不能通行。有人說這些殘存的小丘，當是故意留着，備軍事上用的，這說法想有幾分可信。這海峽是很容易阻止西來的競爭者的侵入的。可是東面的外港，却極為空闊，把新加坡軍港，造在島的東北部，上述的形勢，或不免也是理由之一吧。　　碼頭的背後，是一條很長的平坦遠通島的西部的大路，我只走到過班讓，一路都以相當距離沿着海岸，迤西如何就不淸楚。到班讓的决數實也極少，通常只由丹容巴葛的東頭，走到P＆O（英郵船公司）的大門左近打轉罷了，這時節，凑巧我移居到丹容巴葛的附近，所以這條路成為我躑躅的塲所。說躑躅，這兩字似乎太嫌詩意，實在這條路也頗與我前一向的認識相反，竟頗不缺乏詩意，很値得詩人去躑躅。不過我幷不想冒充詩人，我用這兩個字，僅僅只是代表常地僑胞所常說的，等於散步的一句潮州話，平常聽慣了這兩個字，總覺這比說散步富於餘味。　　大概躑躅兩字的由來，只是形容木屣和道路相擊的聲言，自我們不再着木屣以後，我們對這意味已不能領味，因而這句話也在我們口頭消失，而南方人還繼纕用着木屐，所以還仍用作口語。他們整天穿木屐的，倒還視着木屐行路為平常，我們却縱在南方，還是着木屐的時候太少，只有在身體完全不被一切雜事拘束的時候，才會隨意拖上木屣，又偶然信步走出屋子，再隨便走向漸遠。這樣，每一次躑躅躑躅的聲音，都是伴着一空明的心境的，自然每會感着躑躅是一種愉快。有一次在深深的靜夜，和一個熟友躑躅進寂然無人的植物園。兩下都不作聲響，只互聽着足下的屐聲，那時眞有一切是整個的和諧，安定之感。不料這樣的感覺，居然在一向只見牠的活動的丹容巴葛，又偶然會領略得到。　　遇着碼頭上熱鬧，我的躑躅只是在外面的道上。碼頭上冷落，連守門的馬打都閒得諱着路人攀話的時候，也就時躑躅到碼頭上去。有時簡直一隻船沒有，有時縱有一兩隻，船上也除一二個看守人以外，也都走盡，寂寞的看守人，很歡迎你去船游覽。殷勤地招呼談話，雖然發覺我們不能聽懂他們的語言，他們却看作更有趣的對象，變換着廣州話，廈門話，海南話，馬來話，英國話企圖講通。The　That　IlnMata等幾個簡單的字，也居然能帮助不少。憑他們的指點，我認識了一些海中的生物。有一次使我認識了水母，眞非常高興。牠的形體，很像是戴着圓笠，披着裙裾的小人兒，或者眞就是希臘神話中女水仙的影子吧。　　想起金蘋菓的故事，海匃力士不是遇到女水仙們，要留他在一起玩嗎？她們在天涯海角，實在太寂寞了。一個繁盛商港前水母的飄游，實在也反應出寂寞之感。寂寞中能生長許多懷想，想到過去各地留下的踪跡，想到接觸的事物，想到交識過的人，速以前在丹容巴葛送走的一些幷不十分熟悉的人也都想到。到底他們走掉了後，還有我以偶然的機會，到這離別地來起一些不相干的懷念。我呢，當前就只是獨自的躑躅，這躑躅把我對碼頭弄得十分熟悉，將來我自然不免懷念牠，可是牠决不會懷念我。後來我終於要在丹容巴葛留下一會懷念的人，這時實萬想不到。　　匆匆的又是幾月，故國的冰霜，終於牠困於炎熱的人誘引回去。預定六點鐘開的船到八點還沒有開，問船上的人，知道在十二時以前總不會開，於是我又到碼頭去作最後一次的散步，送客的是早已散了，碼頭上只賸零落的幾盞燈，遠遠地晃動着一兩個人影。人影正對着我走行來，不知我為什麼要轉灣，那面的人把我呌住，我才知道是來送我的。他們白天本已來過，我也和離別一般人一樣地向他們道過別。一塲離別，本來也很灑然，他們却再來了，丹容巴葛眞會要使我在再嘗一點別離的滋味？這幾月來，他們已經是同我一起躑躅過的人，此來正好同完成最後最後一次的躑躅。然而这次大家雖依然默默地走着，大家的心境終不免有點異樣。終於我們三人中感情最柔脆的一個受不住了，我們只能換一地方去走。到深夜我才設法把他們送回家，在獨自回船的道上，我心裏亂得一榻糊塗。回到船上竟不能陲，船又延到决早才開，到四時我只得再得岸上去走一回。半路就遇咋夜來送的人，他們幷不一定料着船還未開，却想早一點知道我確已走了的事實，所以來到我泊船地作一躑躅。呵，這躑躅，我去後想又有過不知幾决，我每一次見到丹容巴葛道名字就不能不懷念。夏　牛　對比  TK離  香山　　雨，推開前面的綠紗窗：植物園的鬱蒼的老樹，籠罩在迷矇的烟霧中，溫室的玻窗上，迸散着玉似的雨珠。　　一木一草，尤其最貧乏的熟透了的景色，但每在自己感情的轉移之間，就能生出種難言的情感：今朝，對於這諳熟的植物園雨景，就有一種甚於靜寂的孤獨之感。　　我廻視下陰暗的屋裏，看見一冊西行歌集塞在桌下的雜紙堆裏，那剝削了的金紙面，在這微暗的室中，露出種豐富的微溫的氣息。　　西行法師的對於旅的熱忱，却引起自己今天出發的旅愁，再遇着這鬱陶的夏雨，從渺漠的夏的空氣裏，就有像油般的戀念之情，湧了過來。這乃是種綜合的感情，雜孕着許多在異國所感到的切身之念。　　至下午，雨還淋然的降着，後窗的小巷眞，有撑着油紙傘的眉頭瑣着憂愁的少女往來若，這時，我的室裏，坐着三個送行的友人，靜穆地頻看窗外的雨景；靜穆達到相當的深度的，就能變成一種超然的恐怖之念；對於這幾個將離開的友人，在這時，與其說是感到離的痛苦，母寗說是感到離的恐怖；因為在偶然的塲合上，短短的行程上，或許都能變得各不相識，甚之成為永訣的事情也有。　　傍晚，雨霽了，我們都不期然的露出笑容；正待走時，靜枝回來了－靜枝是特地為送我走，而提早請假回來的；這裏小小的行動，使自已空虛的心充實起來，豐富起來。當雇好車，以為她可以送我到東京驛去時，但她却含羞的不去了，用盈盈的微笑送着我踏上汽車；汽車在潤濕的街路裏跑者，我感到難言的遺憾－靜枝不能送我走，但同時我却吸盡了這個少女的含羞之情，在她的含羞的脈脈的情感裏，我感得幸福和一首抒情詩的中絕。西江的流浪者  斐兒　　在廣東西江，輸船上永遠不會停止了沿途兜賣膏藥，徵求看相，打打拳頭，或請求施捨的「廣告演唱」，除了夜深睡熟的時候。　　於是從腦筋上勾出了引人聽講的故事，從姿勢上擺出了吸人注意的神情。舌頭果然生了花，而頭腦里眞要裝了不少「寳貝」。　　却也少不了淸唱。　　這里有的是老人，中年人，年輕者，甚至還會看見不滿十歲的小孩子。　　旅途無聊，人是樂於聽聽故事，聽無稽的謊言，杜撰的新聞，和自家製造的小調的。　　人也喜歡看看滑稽的姿態；看人家的胸膛挺得多麼高，筋肉挺得多麼硬的。　　可是——　　『再賣二塊膏藥便不要再賣了。』　　沒有回應。　　『我只看五個相，五個相，多便不來了。』　　其實看相的何曾滿了五個。　　於是輪船上熱哄哄，毫不寂寞：機器聲之外，可也來了「人問苦」的哀唱。　　在西江，我還看過和聽過一對盲人在唱歌。面貌黝黑，鬍鬚是叢生在嘴邊了，為了找尋「仙士」（銅板）的綠故，裝起偏喉來却也會唱起肉麻麻的女調，另一個却是當丈夫，張起大嘴巴露出一口黃牙齒。於是唱着對答的歌詞，夾着調笑的說白。「摩登」和「跳舞」等名詞，突然和「死鬼」「衰佬」碰在一起，引得滿船大笑，倒也勞力稍稍得了報償。　　江上永遠排定有這種滑稽的節目，有娛人「趣味」（什麼趣味？）的淸唱；「大江之歌」在今天還未被改換了樂譜，於是「江上之歌」不知是歌唱着昨天的腐爛，還是今天的頽喪？袁伯修和公安文學  周木齋　　提起明末公安派的袁中郎，總很熟悉的了。現在中郎已被遺忘的時候，再提出乃兄伯修來，雖然也還有跡近附驥尾的嫌疑，想要標榜，已經委屈，但實在覺得有可取的見解，如「白蘇齋類集」卷二十「雜說類」的「論文」上下。「論文上」說：「口舌，代心者也。文章，又代口舌者也。展轉隔礙，雖寫得暢顯，已恐不如口舌矣，况能如心之所存乎？故孔子曰：「辭達而已」。達不達，文不文之辨也。……夫時有古今，語言亦有古今。今人所詫為奇字奧句，安知非古之街談巷語耶？「方言」謂楚人稱「知」曰「黨」，稱「慧」曰「謂」，稱「跳」曰「　」，稱「取」曰「挺」。予生長楚國，未聞此言。今語異古，此亦一證。」從語言的觀點論文，一方面是口語文的暗示，一方面又指出了語言有古今的演變。尤其是「雖寫得暢顯，已恐不如口舌矣」這兩句，借用過去不久的事來譬，近乎大衆話的對於白話。為了文學，單是暢顯，還不够的，具有另一因素的逼眞，是大衆語超過白話的地方。又如「論文下」說：「爇香者，沉則沉烟，檀則檀氣。何也？其性異也。奏樂者，鐘不藉鼓響，鼓不藉鐘音。何也？其器殊也。文章亦然。有一派學問，則釀出一種意見。有一種意見，則創出一般言語。」在縱的時間性以外，又含有橫的空間性的意味，而亦語言的跟着時間自然演變以外，更含有人工創造的意味。　　兩文全篇說得都好，這裏不過選出更精闢的幾句。但假使從這見解去衡量「類集」，結果却未免要失望。別說對於語文的主張沒有實踐，至多只是在「說書類」較多帶些語錄的氣味而已，就是像兩文的見解，也只有「雜說類」的「論隱者異趣」的一則，可以互相發明：「農工商買，廝養皂隸，所作之事，日化月遷，所說之語，亦日異月殊。以其新也。惟俗學終身在人涎沫下作生涯，無一新語，大可厭。」這和「有一派學問，則釀出一種意見，有一種意見，則創出一般言語」相像，却比較更深進了一層，從生活着眼。語言的新異，在於生活有變化，陳腐山於停滯的奴性。對於「農工商買，廝養皂隸」，固然誇張太過，但在反襯出俗學的不堪，可知出於憤慨，而以士人指摘俗學，又顯得痛切的。卽使這一則罷，已經够充實了。　　關於語文主張的不實踐，其實也非偶然，原來兩文的主旨，是反對前後七子的摸擬，語文主張只用以作為破壞的手段，並不是建設的目標。說到反對摸擬，「論文下」還揭露摸擬的「病源」，直接說明的是「在無識」，也就是「無意見」，間接暗示的是「無學問」，無情感。「無學問」又是「無識」的根源，無情感則好像「戲塲中人，心中本無可喜事，而欲强笑，亦無可哀事，而欲强哭」。　　公安派的文學解放運動，是受王陽明學派的思想解放運動的影饗。陽明學派的思想解放運動好比長江大河，公安派的文學運動便是發展的一條支流。單說伯修，他的思想歷程，是歸結到屬於陽明學派的，這關係在「雜說類給充分地顯露了。中間起媒介的作用的，有李卓吾的高足深有，而起决定的作用的，則是卓吾本人。中郎小修，還是受伯修的影響。思想解放和文學解放的關係，可以借用「有一派學問，則釀出一種意見」，可以說是原則，而原則的內容，最好還是「雜說類」引卓吾的「說童心」（「焚書」「雜述」作「童心說」），這是很可貴的一段公安文學史料，因為裏面透露了微妙的消息：「龍洞山農序『西廂』，末語云：『知我者，勿謂我尙有童心可也』。夫童心者，眞心也。若以童心為不可，是以眞心為不可也。夫童心者，絕假純眞，最初一念之本心也。若失却童心，便失却眞心；失却眞心，便失却眞人。人而非眞，全不復有初矣。童干者，人之初也；童心者，心之初也。夫心之初，曷可失也？……童心旣障，於是發而為言語，則言語不由衷；見而為政事，則政事無根底；著而為文辭，則文辭不能達：非內貪以章美也，非篤實生光輝也，欲求一句有德之言，卒不可得。……豈非以假人言假言而事假事，文假文乎？蓋其人旣假，則無所不假矣。由是而以假言與假人言，則假人喜；以假事與假人道，則假人喜；以假文與假人談，則假人喜：無所不假，則無所不喜。滿塲是假，矮塲何辯也？然則雖有夫下之至文，其湮滅於假人而不盡見於後世者，又豈少哉？何也？天下之至文，未有不出於童心焉者也。苟童心常存，則……無時不文，無人不文，無一樣創制體格文字而非文者。詩何必古選？文何必先秦？降而為六朝，變而為近體，又變而為傳奇，變補為院本，為雜劇，為「西廂」曲，為「水滸傳」（這裏原文下面還有「為今之舉子業。大賢言：聖人之道」三句，引文沒有，皆古今至文，不可得而時勢先後論也。故吾因是而有感於童心者之自文也」。原引到這裏為止，但原文下面還有一段譏訾，「六經，語，孟」的話，從道點和上面刪節三句看來，可知車吾着重「童心」，文學是附帶說到的，伯修則比較注意「童心」和文學的關係一方面。這裏再引，用意也在這點。「童心」見於「左傳」；「於是昭公十九年矣，猶有童心，君子是以知其不能終也」，原是一種貶辭，所以龍洞山農序「西廂」要那樣担心。卓吾的「童心晚」，是翻案的文章，以「童心」為「眞心」，已是思想解放，附帶說到的「文何必先秦」，也和公安派的反對「文必秦漢」相近，而以「童心」為「眞心」的理論根據，已無疑的是應用了陽明的「良知」說。伯修所謂「展轉隔礙」，中郎所謂「性靈」，也都有淵源的關係的。白朗布將軍靜聽着  法Andre　Maurois作　　奧萊勒米自法國，在倫敦街上撞着歐格雷德博士。他們在大戰時混在一起會有四年之久。　　「多麼運氣！」博士大聲說。「我正向陸海軍俱樂部去和派克大佐與白朗布將軍午餐。你一定也得去。」　　這位將軍並沒有怎樣改變。他依舊保持以前那樣鎭靜；他的膚色依然紅潤，他的眼睛依舊有生氣。他欣然迎接奧萊勒，派克大佐，雖不减他那譏刺的本色，也有着同樣的友情。　　「怎麼，奧萊勒，」他說「你敢冒你的生命的危險到這個危險的島國來？你們的報紙上還在登載着，卽是現在不，三個月前可是這樣，那樣我們詭計的故事，使我驚奇不止。同時也有些驕傲。我從來沒有想釗英國人能够這樣像你們所描摹的巧詐。誠懇地立卽告訴我們，奧萊勒，眞有許多法國人他們把我們描摹得像——我將怎樣措辭呢？——那樣聰明與陰惡麼？」　　「有許多法國人，」奧萊勒，回答「他們一生從來沒有看到過一個英國人，而他們已經輕信許多關於你們的浮言，正如你們輕信關於他們的一樣。卽是我，大佐，－－敢承認的話？——也有些難於了解你們過去三個月的拖泥帶水。比如說，賀爾。拉伐爾協定，起初採納，後來又推翻了——這件事我深以為並非不列顚的光明正大的態度。」　「關於這件事毫無疑問」，大佐同意着說，「換了巴摩斯東或狄斯拉理，一定不會那樣幹。由我看來，這問題是很簡單的。如果意大利人的光臨伊索比亞對於英帝國眞是一個威脅，我們從開始就應堅决，不向會發生怎樣危險。否則，如果他們的侵入毫無危害我們——從我剛談過的專家報告，情形恰巧如此——那末用這樣無効的制裁去觸怒意大利，是一種謬舉動，我們和意大利一直是好朋友。」　　「那還不是你們揀這樣去做的原因，」奧萊勒說。　　「我的朋友，」大佐回答，「在大戰時，我曾說給你聽好多次，說英國有兩個，保王黨的英國和淸敎徒的英國，前者是獨善的，後者是兼善的。在這次混亂中，我們以往是一直採用淸敎徒的政策。這政策之不會繼續長久。謝天，這是世界上最不合理的國家。空氣已經在逐漸改變。在幾月之內，我們將和意大利把事體解决。　　「怎樣解决呢？」　　「正像一個法國人的問法」，大佐笑着說。「怎樣解决讓我來先問你，一個人能事前知道麼，我們要有什麼機會把握什麼機會。記好英國是一個唯實主義者，是時常預備承認她的錯悞的。他咬牙齒，而繼續保持到底，只有當她不得不這樣做的時候；否則，她並不堅持她自己的立塲。你們法國人信仰理想。而我們英國人崇拜事實。舉例來說，那就是為什麼我們和德國成立海軍談判，這件事也傷了你們的心，但事實上那件事帮助了你們，也帮助了我們。　　「那件事傷了我們的心」，奧萊勒回答，「因為那件事破壞了一個條約。」　　「也許是，奧萊勒，但你可看到你們陸軍方面的困難情形。你們曾經用最可佩服的戇勁來保障條約的尊嚴。可是事實上你們讓德國重整軍備到那樣程度，比之我們不費一文的和解，共危險遠過之無不及。你們這所保持了你們條約上的文字，但精神在什麼地方呢？」　　「由我看起來，大佐，」奧萊勒少許帶些惱怒地搶着說，「你們也同樣曉得怎樣依附條約的字面，當牠可達到你們的目的的時候。你們强制我們嚴格遵守盟的第十六條。不但此也，自戰後以來，你們曾一再勸誘，或者强迫我們走向好多次的折中辦法——每次折中辦法，都是當為最後一次，但沒有一次是遵守的——而其結果，到了現在，像你所說的一樣，那是我們在咬牙切齒。」　　歐格雷德博士到了這時也加入陣營。　　「曾有一個貴國人，奧萊勒，說，將軍們總在準備戰爭，剛在戰爭完畢的時候。外交家也每次同樣起草了以前和平條約中所應載的事物。在一八一四年維也納會議中，梅德湼，泰雷則與加瑟兒里考量當時的觀點，最後勞結成功最能合乎理想的條的。他們獲得歐洲的勢力均衡－那一種勢力以前會經存在過的。但他們忘記了一個新勢力，那就是民族主義。這一新勢力毀壞了他們的工作。在一九一九年，巴黎的條約締造者，有着那樣的前例在他們前面，用盡全力尊重民族性的各方面。但他們太急切於改正上次條約的錯誤，結果他們忘記了一切關於經濟學上的事物。現在，那些他們所很聰明劃分出來的國家不能够自給。你一定會明白下次的和平會議將不想到別的問題而專注重於資源的分配，而同時也必忘了許多我們還沒有想到的原則，但這些原則將來也必變為唯一有關大家的因素。」　　「博士，」奧萊勒笑着說，「我承認你一如往昔的高論。我們獲得了什麼敎訓呢？」　　「怎末，那就是條約永遠是不完全的；而我們也應該竭力設法利用無數次的再生的國聯去改正條約的錯，加果達到這樣目的而對於國聯並不過分的毀損的話說。」　　「你得承認，」奧萊勒說，「我們對那個機關的第一次經騐就不大圓滿。」　　「第一次經濟從來就沒圓滿過，」博士回答。「記着國聯從開始就應該有藥國的扶助。如果我們獲得這，一切事都將兩樣。」　　「你認為我們可以麼？」　　「也許可能吧」大佐回答着。美國抱定中立的觀念已有十年。現在她也許明白眞正的中立是空中樓閣。歐洲發生戰爭的第一個影響就會把幾百萬以上的美國人推入失業之羣。你怎會相信那裏一個政府到了那時會阻止製造廠家接受付現金的定貨呢？卽是那能辦到，難道墨西哥或加拿大的貨物也不流出麼？那末一九一六年的故事又將再見。最有見識的美洲人士早已在考量是不是在這時候把美國的力量放在維護和平方面較為有見地些。」　　「找希望他們快些，」裏萊勒說。　　「衆位先生們，」白朗布將軍挿進來說，「在一個鐘點裏，在我靜聽你們的時條，　　我已經是在奇怪——」　　「什麼先生？」　　「不過這一點吧了，先生們——我們午餐將吃些什麼呢？」（絡緯譯）</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言居正等飛邕遇風  我　　一日廣州電，居正朱培德程潛，於今晨四時三十分，由廣州乘飛機，前往南寗，對和平解决桂局事，作最後之努力，居等並携有蔣委員長致李白親筆函，內容勸李白以民族利害為前提，協力完成國家統一，不料飛至肇慶，突遇在風大雨，中途折回，致一些和平之希望，又為風伯雨師所打斷，雖風定雨息之後，仍可前往，惟於最短時期中，則和平之機不免為之停頓矣。　　我國人渴望廣西事件之能和平解决，猶如望歲，不料又為風雨所阻，深為遺憾，蓋此次李白崛强於廣西，不與中央合作，此在李白個人言之，誠不免昧於識時之譏，而以國家大局言之，原有深切不幸之慨，故中央為李白計，為國家前途計，極願與李白和平合作，决不願操同室之戈，是以和平之使，至再至三，派遣前往，更不惜提出和平最低條件，與李白協商，而不意又為風伯雨師所作祟也。　　我考量此次李白所以不能與中央合作之理由，眞百思而莫得其解，李白固以救國禦禍為旗責者，倘李白不與中央合作，是否可以救國？中央不與李白合作，必為救國禦禍之障碍，此固彰彰在人耳目者也，李白對於此種地方，不能平心靜氣，多加考慮，根本不受和平條件，則李白樹立救國禦禍之幟，無非是欺世盜名之具，而非眞有救國禦禍的精神者也。　　李白卽不為國家大局計，卽為個人一身計，為桂省一地人民計，亦不應倔强不屈到底，萬一中央忍無可忍，竟至不得已而用兵，則戎首之罪，李白其安能辭，並且桂省僻處西南隅，地廣而荒，財力竭蹶，從前兩粵之所以能獨樹一幟，而不受中央命令者，恃廣東財富之區為之合作耳，今廣東已歸中央統制，則桂省一隅之地，任何頑强抵抗，必至玉石俱焚，此塗炭生靈糜爛地方之罪，又當誰受之？　　總之李白對於中央或個人，卽有嫌隙，亦不能以國家為犧牲，以地方為孤注，當此千鈞一髮的環境中，而不能舍一己之私怨，而亂國家之大謀，今之持論者當以李白為何如人耶，後之讀史者更將以李白為何如人耶，惟昨又據香港電訊，居正等已飛抵南寗，李白均到機塲歡迎，同赴省府，恊商和平方案，並且南路桂軍，亦有大部撤回之訊，果爾，則和平曙光，雖暫受打擊，而結果仍回復光明，此固我人所當額手稱慶者也，國家安危之機，在此一舉，我輩不勝熱烈望之。報娘恩  梅平　　七月，是鬼的季節。在上海，有一部份特殊人物就在鬼的身上打算，現在每一條弄口，每一條小巷不是都張掛着紙衣紙帽嗎？在鄉下，七月里一定有一次城隍爺出巡。他們的理由是：餓鬼在這個月里都被陰曹釋放出來，到處與風作浪，時疫的發生，田地的歉收都和那批鬼有關係的。城隍爺出巡一次，就是把那批鬼收去，同時出巡時大家散振一點錠箔之類作為送鬼的路費，從此天下太平了。　　出巡時的仗儀是頗為壯觀的，金鑼，馬牌，亭傘…還有許多外行人所呌不出的名目。如果今年大家捐欵擁躍，辦事人就特別出勁，扮戲文，蚱殼精，蕩湖船，那些扮演的人又有種出奇的本領，用丈來高的木棍縛在鞋子上，像二個木脚似的，呌做高蹺。要顯出他們本領的高强，戲文總是三本鐵公鷄什麼的打武戲。那你就想一想吧，做馬夫的，做向大人的在高過屋脊的半空中賣力做戲，但是二支脚已被木棍管束着了，他們要維持着身體的重心不致傾跌，那就比舞臺上的戲文好看得多了。城隍爺出巡總是兜着田岸，因為他們最主要的原因是希望大豐收，他們把自已的貧窮都歸罪於那批餓鬼了。這樣，頭道鑼打過之後，要看到做戲文的高蹺常常費去大半天的。有的小孩子，婦人都跟隨在仗儀後面看他們做戲，他們是難得有這樣的好戲看的。　　除高蹺之外，還有二種好看的節目，是報娘恩和犯人。做犯人的他們都生過難治的病症，在醫生束手之後，他們就向城隍爺乞靈了，普通總一杯水和一包香灰，據說這種仙藥十之九是有起死回生的效力的。於是病人就是寄名給城隍爺，到每次出巡的時候，他們都穿了紅衣紅裙的犯衣，跟在仗儀的後面，一直從城隍爺出巡到回閣。（城隍爺坐鎭的廟的最後進呌閣）我的堂兄生下地來就是一塲大病，是服了仙水和香灰得以更生的，自然他每年要做一次犯人：後來他到中學讀書，他明白了這種習俗的荒謬，他要拒絕那種扮演，幾乎被鎭上人打到我叔父的家里去，他們要叔父保證那年田里不出毛病。那些可憐的鄕下人，完全屈服在神的威靈（？）之下了！　　報娘恩，從這名字上就可以知道它的意義了。但是你曉得是怎樣一種報法呢？那些扮報娘恩的在出巡的午前都喝飽了酒，在他們神志糢糊的時候，有執事入用生薑搽擦他們的手臂，使那地方的神經麻木了，用一連串的銅鈞穿過他們的皮膚，再在銅鈎下縛着重量的物件，如香爐，蠟臺，甚至是放一架留聲機，沿途唱着蠟片的。自己離開故鄉太久了，在我糢糊的記憶中，我小時候是很喜歡看那種殘酷的扮演的，他們伸直了手臂，用一支木棍支在脅下，這樣不致手臂上吃不住底下的重量。他們都是很英雄地跟在仗儀之中；但是在他們酒性過了之後，他們感到了刺骨的疼痛，不過他們還得忍耐着到城隍爺回閣。做母親的對於那種報娘方法，却從來沒有想到那是不合法的，而且兒子做過報娘恩回家她們認為是無上的光榮，因為可以使全鎭人知道她的兒子是個孝子。　　現在已經沒有人肯替那批餓鬼焚化錠箔了，孩子們也沒有戲文好看了，故鄉的城隍爺已三年沒有出巡，那不是神的威靈失敗了，實在他們已沒有多餘的錢，雖然他們心中都默認着現在更窮的情况是城隍爺沒有出巡的緣故。嘯  廖楚咻　　昔人云「淸秋宜嘯」，現在淸秋雖則年年有，而嘯大槪已經失傳了。嘯在昔人的詩中常常引用到，可見在當時嘯實在有方法，有程度的，絕對不像某地人認為嘯就是狂喊！　　世說「阮步兵嘯聞數百步，蘇門山中，忽有眞人，樵伐者咸共傳說，阮籍往觀見其人，擁膝岩側，藉登嶺就之，箕踞相對，籍商略終古，上陳黃農主寂之道，下考三代盛德之美，以聞之，屹然不應，復叙有為之敎，棲神導氣之術，以觀之，彼猶如前，凝矚不轉，籍因</p>

<p>對之長嘯，乃笑曰；「可更作」，籍復長嘯，意盡退還半嶺許，聞上猶然有聲，如數命鼓吹，林谷傳響，顧看，乃向人嘯也」。魏氏春秋亦云「嘗遊蘇門山，有隱者，莫知姓名，有竹實數斛，杵臼而已。籍聞而從之，談太古無為之道，論五帝三五之義，蘇門先生翛然，曾不眄之籍以於嘐然長嘯，韵響寥亮，蘇門先生乃翛然而笑。籍旣降，先生喟然高嘯，有如鳳音，籍所知音，乃假蘇門先生之論，以寄所懷。湧幢小品，亦云：「蘇門公嘯有六如，一如深由虎，一如大海龍，一如高柳蟬，一如巫峽猿，一如華丘鶴，一如瀟湘雁。」可見所謂蘇門先生，實在是一位嘯的名家，而阮嗣宗，也是一個能手。　　當時他們的嘯，到底有幾種方法，現在是不能知道了。但是嘯的失傳，我們是比什麼都可惜的。　　「言為心聲」，這雖則是一句老話，但是不錯的。音樂所以成為高度的藝術者，就是牠能够直接表現人們的悲哀。當然唱歌所以較之音樂更高，也就因為他比音樂更直接。不過，歌唱是需要文學幫助的，唱辭根本就經過一度製作。而嘯大槪不需要字句的罷，那末較之歌唱，嘯是更直接了。　　和嘯一同用的，有長字，有清字，我們從這兩個字上，以及上邊所說的蘇門公約產如中，似乎約略可以知道嘯的達意處了，「會心處，正不在遠」。但是我說不出來。　　我真不知道在我的腦海中，幾次搆成這樣一幅有聲的圖畫，萬山重疊，老松參天，兩個深解嘯理的人，偶然相逢，各不發言，唯相對長嘯，意盡可退，各知其意。那時他們一定感到人類的言語，實在是多餘的。其實不但會嘯的人，不但解嘯的人，就是我們現在假使到了一個雄奇挺秀的深山，或則入幽谷。或則登絕頂，那時，我們一定覺得沒有言語，可以形容我們心上的喜悅，只有對着長空，不自主的脫口高呼。那大槪還是嘯之餘意，同時也是嘯的起源罷。東坡赤　：「劃然長嘯，山鳴谷應」，我不知道東坡之嘯，還是真的嘯，還是像我們一樣的狂喊；不過，到那時需要長嘯是一定的。王維詩：「獨生幽　裏，彈琴復長嘯」。我想這時候王維之嘯，說是「如華丘鶴，如瀟湘雁」，而不會是「如深山虎，如大海龍」罷！　　影片「人猿泰山」中，泰山的幾次高呌，音節雄偉，雖則帶有原始的「嚎聲」，　不過他喊出了「力」和「勇敢」，我們是可以清楚的在聲音中感到的。這聲音，我不知道到底震撼了多少觀眾的心靈，也使我們感到靈魂的活動，那末，當時的專六技門的一種，——「嘯」，給我們一定是更大的感動罷。　　清秋了！使人感到異常的清遠，在這時候，我們希望聽到一聲長嘯，不問「如虎如龍如猿如鶴」！佃戶  士希　　去年七八月間，我和四嬸回到合江鄉下去。　　四嬸在這里是地主，她有幾百畝好田地，佃給人家種的，陳老五便是她們佃戶的一家。　　他是一個五十四五歲的老農民，在兩年前為着納不起租，四嬸曾呌過這公所里的火兵把他抓去關起來，後來他底老婆着了急，便籌了二三十個包谷）在上海呌珍珠米）和幾十個雞蛋，兩眼汪着淚，跑來找四嬸。　　「做做好事吧，把陳老五放出來……」她說：用一種憂傷的調子。　　「我放他出來倒容易，但是你們底租呢？」四嬸用不高興的品調問着。　　「天公在上面，我們實在是沒有辦法，天旱呢……」於是，她咽聲咽氣的便哭起來了，四嬸心內開始軟化了，她呌人把珍珠米和雞蛋檢好收起來。　　第二天陳老五，也就從區公所里給放出來了。但是，老年人經不起苦氣，不久便病倒，死了—從此，陳老五一家只有那個老太婆和金秀，金蝥兩個女孩子了。　　她們母女三口兒克苦地生活着，兩姊妹上山去檢草，檢柴，擔上城去賣，有時從山上回得早，便幫老太婆燒燒飯，上田去做工。老太婆心性硬直，她沒灰心，也沒失過望，她相信自己只要用力苦幹，日子是會過得好起來的；因此她每當天還沒大亮時，便爬起來上田地去工作。她工作得很好，一個人管了好幾畝田地，陳老五在時種幾畝田地，現在她也種幾畝田地，她沒有向四嬸退過　　但是，她底日子并沒有變得好，當四嬸到了鄉下時，便有人偷偷替她着急了。　　「你看連金秀這麼大的女孩子還赤着屁股過日子，看她拿什麼去上租。」　　「年運衰啊，幾十年來也沒有看見像這樣的，谷子剛含苞便被太陽晒死了……」　　「這個老太婆也實在可憐，這一季她是白忙了……」　　「血且說不足還要吃官司呢！」　　村裏人都紛紛議論着，替她擔掛，但是她却像沒有這回事似的向人說着：　　「我要帶她上田里去看，土地開口，種人都變成乾草了，這還向我收什麼。……」　　「我不怕，這不能單怪我的。……」於是她便伸出她那黝黑色，變成乾枯了的手掌，在人家面前揚着，然後便嚴肅地跨着步走了。　　到村後第二天，四嬸便帶了幾個粗工挑着籃子出發，因為天氣還沒見涼爽，我被留在家里，當我躺在竹榻子上看一本從城里帶來的小說，忽然聽見了一陳喊聲從門外揚進來，我忙着爬起來趕出去看，只見四嬸帶了幾個粗工跑在前面，滿面冒着火氣，大着步望門里跑來，籃子是空的，幾個粗工手里却都抓有幾頭雞，它們不時就鼓動着翅膀和足爪，哀哀的呌着。　　在他內們後面跟來了一大羣看熱鬧的人，陳老五老太婆就滿面通紅的，眼里汪着淚水，兩手高高地搖恍着，口里用着嗚咽的聲調呌號着：　　你們要有天良啊！把我家里什麼都打破了，雞也搶走了，我要請你們跟我去看也不行嗎。……」　　隊伍到了門便止住了，有兩個粗工把着扁担把在門口等打老太婆，老太婆也知道他們會有這麼一着，不敢趕近前，只在遠遠地地方站着，呌罵……直到倦了，才沮喪地回去。　　第二天，四嬸帶了同樣的幾個粗工要到另一家佃戶那里去，在路上便聽見說這老太婆一家都吊死了，先是她把那兩個女孩逼上吊，然後自己也上吊………。手册  勞心　　眼看着生活便成问题了，一个失　的穷汉是完全想不到方法去補救的。是又来一次翻箱倒箧。——這無疑是夢想，要希望在箱子里找出點意外的，從前閃在角落里的小錢，那恐怕已是比偷星還要難的事了。　　這樣的一種蠢的，明曉得沒有希望還去死碰的動作，這已不是第一次了。要是有的話，在從先便應該翻了出來，决不會等到今天。——不是嗎？兩個一角的港幣已在一年前換掉了，現在再找，怕連銅錢也找不出一枚。　　當然，結果絲毫沒有例外。來的時候是　滿了衣服的皮箱，翻起來確得花點時候，希望也可多延長幾分鍾才打破。現在咧，衣服已換來了毛邊紙，那紙上真若幾個這衣服的名稱字樣，那日期已是很久很久以前的了。所以也可以少花點工夫，要翻也儘可一翻到底，毫不費力。　　——沒有！　　當然是沒有。有是有的，幾本日記簿，和一些遺留在這兒的舊照片，這些這些都看得已沒了興緻的了，手也懶得翻一翻。要翻嗎。還是翻那本還是這箱子的新客人——一個小學生給我的手册。　（未完）播音節目特别節目　　稚鳴社　　交通（一三○○）下午五時三刻至六時半　　您要那一個抱　（沈瑛）　　梅花接老爺　（柴瑟）　　微微風　（陳萍）　　蝴蝶姑娘　（沈玲陳萍）　　努力　（沈瑛柴瑟）　　路柳墻　　（沈玲）　　電話點唱請撥一八二二八號彈詞　　曹笑英玉蜻蜓　　中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻　　開篇「西廂記」　　秀才人情紙半張。白銀一兩具禪堂。最喜物華三寶地。參禪坐聽解金剛。耳畔杜鵑啼寂寞。異鄉施捨更凄凉。此問是，清風明月無人管。息肩駐足借西廂。閑坐小軒參易理。螢窗開卷念文章。一雙僧俗嘵嘵話。步出青衣婢女娘。為遵崔老夫人命。特地襌房定道塲。先老相爺生死忌。請僧追蔗上西方。十五良辰拜法王。說罷欲行留一步。為是情痴傳粉郎。張生湊上深深揖。姐姐是，莫非鶯鶯小姐的婢紅娘。我是，洛陽才子張君瑞。為姻緣僧舍作書房。蕊珠宮裏煩通報。說我，家中尚未有妻房。紅娘聽。變而龐。相公說話太荒唐。非禮不言從古說。聽書君子愛輕狂。老夫人操冰霜節。三尺僅兒不許入中堂。話說婢聽還可恕。夫人知曉恨非常。從今出口要思量。　　陳楹峯黃迺明故事開篇　　東方（一〇二〇）下午二時至二時三刻　　開篇「琵琶記　書館」　　思親無日不凄凉。蔡伯喈獨坐在書房。想爹娘敎吾勤功讀。到如今，文章反悮吾爹娘。悶來卽便觀書本。誰知偏又動悉腸。離坐壁間觀山水盡。看到圖容情暗傷。盡來彷彿吾雙親樣。難道是，聖人楊貨一般龐。卽忙便把夫人問。未知何故掛書房。相公嚇。欲知圖畫之中意。上面題句細推詳。反一句來反一句。觀來合我意徬徨。夫人起口呼姊姊。相請五娘出內堂。何故渾身穿素縞。怎得孤身到帝邦。相公嚇，自從別後飢荒遇。翁姑相繼命辭陽。聞一語。淚兩行。傷心哭倒蔡中郎。掛冠解帶藍袍脫。辭官居上表別君干。共行孝道轉家鄉。　　邢瑞亭三笑　　上海（一一〇〇）下午四時至四時三刻、　　開篇「武十回　打虎」　　英雄自古性剛强。何懼高峯虎豹狼。纔信酒家言確實。單身切莫過山崗。景陽崗近有斑爛實。單身切莫過山崗。景陽崗近有斑爛虎。鳴鑼聚眾預提防。武松未見心無慮。醉薰薰提棍步跟蹌。正逢日暮星辰起。遙觀峻嶺樹蒼蒼。荊棘業中虎穴藏。醉時困倦朦朧睡。半刻之間風正狂。吼聲大作振山崗。虎威舞爪張牙勢。武松記棍太匆忙。平空棍斷膽驚慌。幸虧力大如牛勇。白額斑爛頃刻降。故此聖嘆好批章。　　周振玉義妖傳　　元昌（一一二〇）午夜零時三刻至一時半、　　開篇「沈鳳喜」　（咪咪集創刊號）　　憔悴春風兩髪無。飄零誰識舊韓娥。天橋賣藝聊糊口。可憐她是，末路的生涯受災磨。絃鼓清彈身世戚。悲秋一曲斷腸歌。偏遇那，知音的年少樊家子。蜜意稠情未可多。誰知道，好事從來遭物忌。傷心無限惡風波。莫怪那，窮途無賴的三絃叔。只怪得，兩字虛榮竟入魔。可笑她，想思唱斷陽嗣曲。十斛的難愁淚滿渦。誰知一入侯門深如海。將軍的勢力果嵯峨。但見那，珠眾繽紛心先醉。竟將舊日恩情助碧莎。　管得，又盟細約訂香羅。可憐她，一片痴心無藥救。可憐她，因緣錯指竟做蘭中　。只　得，凄凉紈易秋風斷。病榻呻吟</p>

<h3>Bank of China to Establish Branch in Bangkok; Ling Bing in Contact with Minister Kong</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) When our delegation to Siam conducted its investigation, it made efforts to develop trade between China and Siam. However, neither country has a large-scale banking or financial institution in Bangkok, causing great inconvenience to overseas Chinese. They repeatedly requested the delegation to convey their request to the domestic financial authorities to establish a large-scale bank with Chinese capital in Bangkok to facilitate the commercial development of overseas Chinese. The delegation followed the opinions of the overseas Chinese and mentioned this matter when discussing it with the Siamese Minister of Economic Affairs, who agreed to support it. Therefore, there are rumors of the Bank of China establishing a branch in Siam. The reporter recently visited Ling Bing, the head of the delegation, to inquire about this matter. According to him, there is indeed a proposal to request the Bank of China to establish a branch in Bangkok to facilitate trade between China and Siam. He has been in contact with Minister Kong these days, and he will have to go to Shanghai to discuss it with Song Ziwen in the near future. The outcome is still uncertain.

<h3>Bandit Troops in Zhangbei Suddenly Active in Western Suiyuan</h3>

<h3>The Entire Guangdong-Hankou Railway Has Opened to Traffic</h3>
<p>The entire Guangdong-Hankou Railway has opened to traffic. It officially began on September 1st, with Guangzhou and Wuchang as the northern and southern terminal points. Spanning three provinces, it is a thousand miles long, and the journey takes 44 hours. This can be said to be a fast achievement. In the future, when it is connected with the Pinghan Railway, the north-south trunk line will be direct and unimpeded. It can be said to be a testament to the power to shrink distances. With the grand plan just beginning to unfold, our expectations are high. Without waiting for the fanfare of the grand opening ceremony on Double Tenth Day, our feelings of joy and celebration today are already overflowing.</p>
<p>The proposal to build the Guangdong-Hankou Railway dates back as far as seventy years ago. After several deliberations and negotiations, materials were purchased, workers hired, and funds raised. It was not easy to gather the funds, and the project was vast. It was necessary to adopt a step-by-step approach to gradually complete the entire railway project. At that time, for the sake of convenience, it was divided into three sections for implementation. In the north was the Xiang-E Road, and in the south was the Guang-Shao Road, both of which were opened to traffic earlier. Only the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section in the middle was suspended due to overlapping mountains and difficult engineering. It was not until thirteen years later, in the twenty-second year of the Republic, that the Ministry of Railways finally made the determination to supervise the project and diligently manage it. Although the deadline was four years, the actual construction took only two years and eight months to complete. It is the same project. Delaying it took thirteen years without success, while focusing on it took thirty-two months to complete. From this, it can be seen that for those who need to be engaged in affairs, the key lies in human effort. If those in power are determined to make a decision and those in charge of affairs work hard, what policies are not easy to implement, and what things cannot be achieved? Those who are dilatory and follow the old ways only shirk responsibility. Even if they speak euphemistically, it is only equal to wasting words.</p>
<p>Based on the above, we believe that the completion of the entire Guangdong-Hankou Railway not only facilitates transportation, but also promotes economic and cultural development. The significant meaning lies in demonstrating the progress of China's engineering industry and showing that those in charge of affairs can uphold their spirit of courage and wash away the bad habits of the past. This will bring them closer to the hopes of the people. The Chinese people are accustomed to clinging to preconceived notions and hold a skeptical attitude towards government-run enterprises. They either say that they are of no benefit to themselves or that they see no hope of success. The carelessness and negligence of official affairs are indeed mostly to blame. Some pass on documents and orders, while others focus on making propaganda on paper. A matter takes months or years to complete. They do not realize that the people's wisdom is opening up and is far different from the past. Tricks are no longer effective. It is difficult to win the trust of the people unless they are marked by facts. In recent years, the construction of highways in various places has made great progress, and most people have gradually changed their views. Now, the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section has been able to complete a difficult project in the blink of an eye. What it shows to everyone is no small supplement.</p>
<p>Due to the completion of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, we can now turn our attention back to the two major projects in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The construction of the Qiantang River Bridge and the connection of the entire Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway were what we eagerly hoped for three years ago. Since then, we have repeatedly written articles to encourage them, looking forward to their completion. To this day, although the time for their realization has not yet arrived, the vastness of the project is obvious and is progressing actively. It is said that traffic between Hangzhou and Ningbo will be open by early August next year, and the Qiantang River Bridge will be completed around the Double Tenth Festival. Borrowing the current joy to plan for the future, our hearts are fervent and almost unable to be restrained. We sincerely hope that those in charge of these matters can work even harder to expedite the completion of the projects, so that they can rival the Guangdong-Hankou Railway in terms of speed.</p>

<h3>Japan Increases Submarines and Destroyers, Exceeding Treaty Limits Significantly; Ambassador Yoshida Prepares to Negotiate with Britain; US Government Not Expected to Protest</h3>
<p>(London) London naval circles are discussing the fact that Japan intends to invoke the escalator clause of the London Naval Treaty, reserving 11,059 tons of excess destroyer tonnage and 15,598 tons of excess submarine tonnage, in response to Britain's reservation of 40,000 tons of excess destroyer tonnage. Strictly speaking, the warships that Japan is allowed to reserve under the naval treaty must be of the same type as those reserved by Britain. However, Japan claims that it has a large number of aged destroyers, which is far from the 28,000 tons permitted by the treaty, so it is adding submarines to make up for it. According to the opinion of experts, Japan's current submarines have already reached the maximum limit permitted by the treaty, and if it increases further, its number will greatly exceed the limit by the end of this year. The United Kingdom and the United States are currently considering how to respond to Japan. The Times commented on this matter as follows: "Although some people believe that Japan's decision does not violate the spirit of the naval treaty, we must know that the actions of any country," "If there is any excess of the treaty provisions, the consent of all signatory countries must first be obtained, and all matters related to both parties must not be decided unilaterally. If there is any doubt about the interpretation of the treaty, Japan will continue to discuss and resolve it." According to Japanese sources in Washington, the United States seems unlikely to protest, because Japan's actions do not violate the spirit of the treaty, and allowing it to retain old submarines after the deadline is far more economical than building new destroyers. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Teruo Hachiya, Secretary of the Japanese Embassy in Britain, visited Holman, Secretary of the British Foreign Office, at noon on the 2nd to personally deliver the Japanese government's note on increasing warship tonnage and to negotiate the timing of a formal meeting between Ambassador Yoshida and Counselor Craigie. The Japanese government's note is quite simple, informing Japan of its treaty-exceeding submarine tonnage to maintain equal strength with Britain's destroyer reserves. According to observers familiar with the matter, Ambassador Yoshida's negotiations with Counselor Craigie on this matter are bound to gain British understanding. It is reported that the main points of Japan's note to Britain are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Japanese government acknowledges that Britain holds 40,000 tons of destroyers exceeding the tonnage limit of the treaty.</p>
<p>(2) The Japanese government holds 11,000 tons of destroyers exceeding the tonnage limit and 15,600 tons of submarines exceeding the tonnage limit, totaling 26,600 tons. The Japanese government holds submarines because the destroyer excess tonnage is small and communicates this information. (2nd Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Representatives of 32 Countries Convene World Peace Conference; France Has 2,500 Representatives; Germany Is the Only Country Without a Representative</h3>
<p>Brussels The World Peace Movement Conference is scheduled to open at 8:00 PM today. Participants include representatives from 32 countries (Germany has not sent a representative). China is represented by Tao Xingzhi and Qian Junrui. The agenda includes the following three items: (1) The inviolability of treaty obligations should be recognized. (2) Concluding international agreements to reduce and limit armaments and abolish the profits of arms manufacturing and sales. (3) Strengthening the League of Nations. In terms of the number of representatives, France has the largest number, totaling 2,500.

<p>(Paris) The Morning Post recently commented on the turbulent situation in the Soviet Union, stating, "The working masses in the country have recently had various brewing incidents. For example, in Magnitogorsk (in the Ural Mountains region), a Communist Party fighter named Dabagov, who is very old, is one of the leaders of the trade unionist faction, and a friend of Tomsky (who recently committed suicide in the counter-revolutionary case), recently gathered several workers from the opposition faction of the Stakhanov movement (movement to improve productivity), that is, workers with lower wages, and secretly organized a committee to plan to incite a general strike and to incite peasants and soldiers to revolt at the same time. However, the matter was discovered by Gugo Berk, an investigator from the secret political police bureau, who arrested Dabagov and twelve of his accomplices and sent them to Moscow, where they were detained in Lubyanka Prison. In addition, investigators Yagoda, Agranov, and Lyushkov are investigating in other industrial centers, paying particular attention to workers in the Ural Mountains region." (3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Spanish Government Troops Retreat: Irun on the Brink of Collapse; Outlying Defenses Lost; Defenders Prepare for Street Fighting</h3>
<p>Hendaye: Yesterday, Spanish rebel forces seized Mount Turiat and Mount Labentxa, controlling two of the three high points overlooking Irun. With these losses, the government forces defending Irun are in a precarious situation. It is reported that the rebels are now close to the outskirts of the city, but it is expected that fierce fighting will be necessary to capture it. Government troops in Irun are now desperately preparing for a last-ditch stand, setting up barricades in all streets and deploying troops to defend all strategic locations. Mount Turiat, the first and most important gateway, fell yesterday after heavy fighting. The mountain's trenches were heavily fortified with militia, and their forward defenses were constructed of iron plates and sandbags, but all were destroyed by rebel bombardment. The intensity of the artillery fire was unprecedented. Once the bombardment had taken effect, they awaited with rifles. Foreign legionnaires, regular troops, and Falangist party members charged forward at the order to attack, and quickly seized the position. A government armored train returned fire, rapidly and repeatedly. Defenders behind the sandbags also fired continuously from the mountain, attempting to cut off the rebel advance. However, the rebels advanced relentlessly and irresistibly, catching the government troops off guard. In a matter of moments, the yellow and red flag was waving from the mountaintop. Having succeeded, the rebels took the opportunity to attack Mount Labentxa. The defenders fiercely resisted for some time under a hail of machine-gun and rifle fire, but were ultimately forced to retreat due to the overwhelming rebel assault. With the fall of Mount Labentxa, the rebels completed their seizure of the ridge of Mount Turiat, and were able to advance to the hilltop area around the San Marcial church, controlling the entire city. The rebels bombarded the church for a while. The government artillery at Fuenterrabía also returned fire vigorously. The rebels then launched a strong assault on the San Marcial church. The government troops, relying on their advantageous position near the French border, only occasionally responded with rifle fire, offering little resistance. Rebel foreign legionnaires also attacked Behobia on the border. The defenders retreated while fighting, but gave up every inch of ground only after a fierce struggle. By 5:15 PM, the rebel vanguard had reached the city gates, and street fighting began. Government troops and militia used all sorts of cover to prepare for a bitter fight into the night. It was then reported that demoralized troops were looting in the city. Government troops were fleeing into France, where they were disarmed by French border guards. It is said that a total of one thousand refugees crossed the border into France last night. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Behobia: Our special correspondent reports that Spanish rebel forces occupied the heights of Labentxa at 5:30 PM today, and the San Marcial fort at 6:35 PM. Although government forces still hold Irun, the situation in the city is extremely critical, as the rebels have seized all the high ground surrounding Irun. It is expected that the outskirts of the city will be occupied by the rebels tonight. From 12:30 PM today, the rebels began preparations for an attack, heavily bombarding the government positions on Mount Turiat. At 1:30 PM, rebel infantry charged the government trenches. Government forces on Mount Labentxa resisted with armored vehicles. The two sides held out for three hours. At 5:15 PM, the rebels had advanced to within 500 meters of Mount Labentxa. The government armored vehicles were forced to retreat. Fifteen minutes later, the red and yellow royalist flag was hoisted on Mount Labentxa, which was then occupied by the rebels. The People's Front troops defending the position were annihilated. Among them were many foreign volunteers, including French, German, Italian, and Belgian nationals, who also perished. In addition, eighty People's Front fighters fled in panic across the French border, where they were disarmed and taken in by French police. At the same time, the rebels pursued to the town of Behobia. Residents resisted by firing out from behind walls and indoors, hindering the rebel advance. However, at that time, all roads leading to Behobia and Irun were under rebel control. The rebels pressed their attack, and the San Marcial fort was occupied after a brief resistance. The rebels then opened fire on the town of Behobia. Civilians in the town fled to France with bags and furniture, and driving livestock. The People's Front fighters in the town were determined to defend it to the death, retreating to the next building to resist after one building was destroyed. As for the government troops inside Irun, they have prepared for street fighting. Therefore, before the rebels occupy the outskirts of Irun, the number of casualties on both sides is feared to be very high. Tonight, government forces fired large 75mm guns from the Fuenterrabía fort, striking the San Marcial fort and the rebel rear. Three shells landed in rice paddies in the French town of Biriatou, but only one exploded, fortunately without injuring anyone. San Sebastián was quiet during the day, and the fighting has not yet begun there. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Irun Suburbs: Both Armies Hastily Construct Fortifications; Rebel Attacks Make No Progress</h3>
<p>Hendaye: The rebels won a victory in their attack on Irun, but did not enter the border town of Behobia. Since occupying San Marcial, which controls the mountaintop overlooking Irun, the rebels have made no further progress. Fighting resumed at dawn today, and was very intense. Both sides exchanged rifle fire. The government artillery at Fuenterrabía bombarded San Marcial continuously, struggling to stop the rebel advance. The rebels are now building defenses around Irun to hold their ground, and the government troops are also building new defensive works throughout the night. The rebels were blocked by the dark and rain and made no progress. All traffic in Irun is now at a standstill. Residents of the French town of Hendaye are afraid to go out due to the falling stray bullets. Two French border guards were wounded by bullets near Behobia. Today, another fifty-four militiamen fled into France, and were all disarmed. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Hendaye: Our special correspondent, just arrived from the front lines of Irun in northern Spain, reports that after the rebels succeeded in seizing the heights of Labentxa and the San Marcial fort yesterday, they transferred three hundred fresh troops from Pamplona, along with a machine gun unit, and two additional cannons, which were towed to the designated locations. This morning at 9:00 AM, they resumed firing on Irun. "The situation in the city is dire, and it is likely to fall this afternoon." As a result, refugees from the war zone have again crossed the border into Hendaye. It is estimated that no less than several thousand people arrived here this morning, and they will be sent by the local authorities to Saint-Jean-de-Luz, Biarritz, and Bayonne for temporary shelter. However, before departure, they must receive vaccinations at the station. The government troops in Irun, faced with a desperate situation, are digging trenches everywhere in an attempt to stop the rebel advance. On the rebel side, troops first gathered on the heights of Labentxa, and were then ordered to attack the town of Behobia, engaging in fierce fighting with the government troops holding the houses in the town. Other rebel units remained in the rear as reserves. These troops were singing, lying down, or bathing in the Bidassoa River, appearing very relaxed. Most of these troops are Carlist royalists, wearing red berets, making them easy to distinguish. In addition, three government aircraft flew to the rebel front lines, dropping bombs and driving away one rebel aircraft. The artillery bombardment on both sides was not as intense as in previous days, and most of the shells did not explode upon landing. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Hendaye: Our correspondent reports that the Irun area in northern Spain was quiet overnight. At 6:00 AM this morning, both sides reopened fire, and the fighting was extremely fierce. The rebels advanced along the banks of the Bidassoa River. Government troops immediately responded with heavy bombardment from the Fuenterrabía fort. After the two sides engaged, several stray bullets landed in Hendaye. The local authorities have prohibited citizens from walking in the streets to avoid danger. In addition, two French soldiers in the border town of Behobia were killed by stray bullets at night. At this time, government troops in Irun have deployed obstacles in the city in preparation for street fighting. At the same time, the air force will also be deployed to assist in the battle. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Hendaye: After the rebels in northern Spain resumed their offensive towards Irun this morning, their air force flew to Irun and Fuenterrabía at 1:30 PM, dropping bombs. Three bombs landed in Irun and four in Fuenterrabía. At the same time, government artillery fired on rebel positions. In Behobia, near Irun, the situation has remained unchanged since the fighting began this morning. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Biriatou: Spanish rebels fiercely attacked the outer defenses of Irun today, advancing half a mile and breaching the defenses of Mount Benta. In this battle, the rebels advanced on several fronts, using rifles, machine guns, cannons, and aircraft. They first occupied the customs house, planting rebel flags along the way. Government troops and militia were unable to resist and fled to the village of Biriatou for a brief respite, and burned two abandoned cars. After the rebels seized the customs house, armored vehicles arrived and threw hand grenades. Three French militiamen in the customs house were killed by the explosions. Fifteen Spanish militiamen had fled in advance. The rebels also knew that spies inside France were directing government artillery fire, so they shot at anything that moved. They then occupied a mountain peak overlooking Irun. The defenders in the city returned fire from the houses. The attack began at 2:00 PM today. There was fog in the morning, and the fighting stopped briefly. When the battle resumed, the sun was shining brightly. (Guomin, 2nd)</p>
<p>Hendaye: The rebels began attacking the town of Behobia this morning. Over three hundred rebels, in four heavy trucks adorned with the rebel red and yellow flags, arrived at the observation posts of the bunkers at Lapentxa, reinforcing the attacking rebels. Subsequently, several new armored vehicles and two heavy cannons, towed behind tractors, arrived one after another. These fresh troops were all Carlists, wearing small red caps. All the reinforcements, according to predetermined military strategy, advanced in skirmish lines towards Behobia, and then opened fire on the enemy, using natural cover. The rebel reinforcements rested in the rear, singing loudly and shouting the slogan "Long live Spain." Government shells fell on rebel positions, but most did not explode. Several People's Front militia units advanced from the other side of Behobia, onto the international bridge, and dispersed at the entrance to the town, firing continuously. At the same time, three government aircraft appeared in the sky, dropping bombs on rebel lines. Hundreds of refugees fled into France today, saying, "The fighting is about to stop, and Irun will soon be lost." They also said that the morale of the defenders seems to be collapsing. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Madrid: The rebels have a widespread network of spies throughout the country. Several have been arrested here recently, including one active-duty colonel. The government's air defense committee has issued an order to residents of the capital that whenever rebel aircraft attack, they should sound a siren as a warning. The public should take shelter in cellars within thirty minutes of the warning. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Losses in the Spanish Civil War</h3>
<p>(Paris) Informed sources estimated today that in the seven weeks of the Spanish Civil War, fifty to sixty thousand people have died, of whom ten thousand were murdered, and the rest were killed in action. The number of wounded is even greater, around ninety thousand. In the recent battle of Irun, nine hundred died and two thousand were wounded. Fighting has been most intense in the Guadarrama Mountains, where two thousand rebels have been killed to date. As for the national economy, the war is causing losses of nearly one million pesetas per day. (Guomin, 2nd)</p>
<h3>International Neutrality Committee: Soviet Russia Expresses Participation; British Chargé d'Affaires Pressuring Germany for a Response</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War by other countries, after the French government proposed to the relevant countries to organize an adjustment committee to formulate various implementation measures, according to official sources, the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Finland have agreed to participate. Among the major European countries, only Germany has not yet submitted a reply. It is generally believed that even if Germany's reply can be delivered here today, this committee will likely not be established within this week. Officials hope that the committee can begin work in the middle of next week. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) It is heard that Germany is prepared in principle to participate, but insists that the committee's powers should be considered first. Because only Germany has not yet accepted this invitation, the British chargé d'affaires in Germany has been ordered to urge the German Foreign Ministry on this matter, and hopes for an early reply agreeing. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) The British and French diplomatic circles, in view of the Spanish Civil War, urgently need to take swift action to deal with it. They are now advocating a committee. Regarding Germany's proposals for the establishment of this committee, there has been no reply to date. However, the Portuguese government has replied in agreement, but with a statement that the scope of the committee's powers must be clearly defined. At the same time, it is a clear and undeniable fact that the Spanish rebels are receiving more foreign aid than the Spanish government, and Portugal is a "corridor" through which war supplies reach the rebels. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Political figures recently stated that if other countries violate the non-intervention agreement in the Spanish Civil War, the Italian government will resume free action. It is commendable that the French government is making every effort to prohibit private agencies within France from secretly transporting weapons to Spain. However, democratic political systems often cannot strictly fulfill their obligations, which is where autocratic systems are superior. If this private trafficking continues, Italy will reconsider its adopted attitude. Regarding the amendment of the League of Nations Covenant, political figures believe that the Italian government does not intend to make any suggestions, because in the government's view, the amendment of the Covenant was still feasible when the Four-Power Pact of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy was signed in July 1933. At this time, the League of Nations has become a "corpse," and amending the Covenant is now too late. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) L'Intransigeant reported that, according to information obtained by the Argentine Ambassador to Spain, Mr. Mansilla, the Madrid government and the Northern Command of the rebel forces in Burgos began contact today. It is heard that the Madrid government has appointed Castro as its "special envoy," who will soon travel to Saint-Jean-de-Luz, where diplomats from various countries are holding a meeting to engage in peace talks. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Hendaye: Our special correspondent reports that members of the diplomatic corps stationed in Spain recently held a meeting in Saint-Jean-de-Luz in southern France, chaired by the head of the diplomatic corps, the Argentine Ambassador to Spain, Mr. Mansilla, to discuss ways to ensure humanitarian considerations in the Spanish Civil War. The Spanish government appointed former Ambassador to Germany, Castro, as a special envoy to represent the government in the discussions of the diplomatic corps meeting. It is heard that the diplomats from various countries not only want to make the war more humane, but also want to find ways to stop the armed conflict between the two sides. However, the Spanish government is making every effort to ensure that the attitude expressed by the diplomatic corps is not seen as recognizing the Burgos military government as a belligerent.

<p>(Paris) The various parties participating in the Spanish People's Front have organized a delegation to France. The delegation, which includes the Spanish Minister of Justice, Domingo, the famous female Communist parliamentarian, Mrs. Iburi, and the former Minister of Justice and Finance, Lalle, arrived in Paris a few days ago. Today, the delegation issued a statement to the press, recounting the origins of the Spanish unrest and the possible consequences of a rebel victory. It stated, "We hope that the Spanish unrest should be judged fairly on its merits. As for the neutrality of various countries, we believe that it is contrary to the rules of international law, not only failing to achieve neutrality, but even achieving the opposite. Because in fact, refusing any assistance to the legitimate current government, while on the other hand some countries are providing open and powerful assistance to the rebels, if this is the case, then so-called neutrality is tantamount to imposing sanctions on the Spanish government. Imposing this kind of real and effective sanction on the legitimate and orderly Spanish government is not only a novel and unheard-of act, but also has infinite dangers. We now dare to assert that French public opinion will agree with our views." Domingo, a member of the delegation, also announced that the delegation will publish a detailed report on the situation of the civil war, which recounts the issue of the German Nazi Party and the Italian Fascist Party aiding the Spanish rebels. He also said that, given the current situation, there is absolutely no possibility of a compromise between the government forces and the rebels. It is heard that members of the delegation will soon meet with Prime Minister Blum for discussions. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Madrid: The Ministry of War announced today that it shot down an aircraft behind the government lines yesterday. The pilot, Manigu, 29 years old, has been proven to be Italian, and documents were found in his aircraft proving that the rebels do indeed have relations with a certain country. According to late-arriving news from the Orsaz area, the most intense air battle occurred on Monday, when four rebel three-engine aircraft and one fighter aircraft attempted to bomb the Taibao area. The government sent two fighter planes, which immediately took off to chase them away, shooting down three enemy aircraft. (Guomin, 2nd)</p>
<p>Perpignan: It was learned here today that a group of Italian expatriate anti-Fascists, led by an Italian colonel, have occupied several villages in the province of Catalonia, and have cut off the road between Alentefar and Huesca. The group has now besieged the rebels near Vichy. (Guomin, 2nd)</p>
<p>Madrid: The American Chargé d'Affaires in Spain, Ventlin, issued a final notice today to American citizens, urging them to leave Madrid as soon as possible. Officials also said today that the United States is considering withdrawing American warships from Spanish waters. (Guomin, 2nd)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Discusses Palestine Issue; Decides to Take Stern Measures; Cuba Opposes Jewish Immigration</h3>
<p>(London) According to reports from the Daily Telegraph and the Morning Post political correspondents, yesterday's cabinet meeting lasted four hours. The most important issue discussed was the current situation in Palestine. According to the Morning Post, there was an absolute guarantee at yesterday's meeting that Jewish immigration to Palestine would not cease. However, the local government is willing to make concessions to the Arabs so that strikes and violence can be avoided. Both newspapers predict that the British government will use stern measures to deal with lawbreakers, and it is possible that martial law will be declared. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) According to responsible sources, the British Cabinet held a meeting today and believes that it would be unfavorable to convene a five-nation Locarno Treaty conference before the Spanish situation is resolved. Therefore, it was decided that preparatory negotiations should be held before the five-nation conference. In addition, the Cabinet discussed the general international situation for four hours. Regarding the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, the Cabinet decided to contact Germany again this afternoon to determine whether Germany would participate in the proposed adjustment committee to be established in London. Germany had suggested that the British government be responsible for coordinating the opinions put forward by the countries concerned, and that it was not necessary to appoint another adjustment committee. On the other hand, the Portuguese government had previously requested an explanation of the implementation of the non-intervention agreement, and the French government has now provided a more detailed explanation to Portugal. If Portugal still has difficulties in participating in the non-intervention agreement, the United Kingdom will negotiate with Portugal again. The Cabinet also considered ways to prevent British citizens from serving in the Spanish army. These methods will soon be implemented. Regarding general international issues, it is heard that the British government is eager for Germany to accept the inclusion of Eastern European issues in the discussions of the Locarno Treaty signatory countries' conference. As for the United Kingdom's proposal to amend the Covenant of the League of Nations, it is now planned not to submit it to this session of the League of Nations General Assembly, because it is futile and useless to discuss the League of Nations and European issues without knowing Germany's intentions. Finally, the Cabinet also discussed the situation in Palestine and decided that the government would not make any concessions under violent pressure. An investigation committee would only be able to start its investigation after order was restored and terrorist acts ceased in Palestine. The next Cabinet meeting is scheduled for next week. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Havana. U.S. Congressman Sirovich recently suggested to Cuban President Gómez that 100,000 to 200,000 oppressed German Jews be relocated to Cuba to engage in agriculture, industry, and commerce. There has been a reaction to this proposal here today. The Spanish-language "Marina Daily" and the "Review Daily" published by the National Democratic Party have both published articles opposing it. Cuban congressmen also privately doubt whether Jewish immigration to Cuba would be beneficial. The "Marina Daily" said that there should be no large-scale immigration of any race to Cuba at this time. The unemployment problem in Cuba is becoming increasingly serious. The Congress has already passed a labor law to take away the jobs of foreigners so that the people of the country can have work. There are still many unemployed and starving Cubans and Spaniards. How can 100,000 to 200,000 more Jews be allowed to come here? Even if Cuba has the possibility of accommodating immigrants, Spaniards should be selected for racial, linguistic, and religious reasons. If the immigrants form their own colonies after entering the country, then the fruits of their labor will only be enjoyed by themselves. The "Review Daily" also stated that the Jewish colonization plan is all bad and will make the people of the country unable to become economically independent forever. As for the opinions of the congressmen, they vary, but those who oppose it are slightly in the majority. Dr. Clima Ta, secretary of the House of Representatives and one of the leaders of President Gómez's Republican Action Party, also opposes the plan, stating that Congress should conduct a thorough study of it before approving it. This is because Jews who immigrate to Cuba mostly gather in one place, adhere to their original customs, do not mix with the Cuban people, and will compete with Cuban workers. Dr. Rivas, the leader of the Liberal Party, further stated that the current state of unemployment in Cuba is already extremely difficult to solve due to the immigration of people from China, the West Indies, and Northern European countries. How can more Jews be allowed to enter the country? Moreover, Jews can form their own countries within countries all over the world.

<h3>Polish Army Chief of Staff Declares Continued Cooperation with France; French Minister of Commerce Scheduled to Visit Warsaw</h3>
<p>Nancy. Polish Army Chief of Staff General Rydz-Śmigły, accompanied by French Army Chief of Staff General Gamelin, inspected French army autumn maneuvers in the vicinity of Souppes and arrived here this afternoon. The city was filled with French and Polish flags, and the garrison troops lined up and saluted with their guns. When the people saw General Rydz-Śmigły, they also cheered him.

<p>(Paris) According to a well-informed diplomatic correspondent of the "L'Écho de Paris," it is rumored in Berlin that France plans to increase the quality and quantity of guns, cannons, and other military supplies to counter Germany's extension of military service. At the same time, France still intends to organize collective security. Regarding this matter, the re-establishment of an alliance between France and Poland is a major element. If France wants to extend its military service, it may not be allowed for economic reasons. French Minister of National Defense and Deputy Prime Minister Daladier estimated that the total number of German troops will reach 850,000 by October of this year, of which 280,000 will be professional soldiers. Of the 400,000 troops of the French army, only 80,000 are professional soldiers. It is reported that German leader Adolf Hitler signed an order on August 25 of this year, increasing the term of active service in the German army, navy, and air force from one year to two years, so that the German army can increase by at least one million soldiers in one year.

<p>Romanian Foreign Minister Announces Foreign Policy; Still Based on Alliances</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania. The new Minister of Foreign Affairs, Antonescu, recently made a statement to the newspapers, explaining the current government's foreign policy, stating that Romania had previously signed treaties of alliance with several countries, and Romania's victory in the European War and the realization of domestic unification after the war were all due to these alliances. In the future, Romania's foreign policy will still be based on these alliances, with the alliances signed with France, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia being the most important. "As far as the Little Entente is concerned, the various economic agreements signed by the three countries and the determination of each country to implement the agreements are sufficient to make the Entente even stronger. As far as Poland is concerned, Romania and Poland previously signed a treaty of alliance based on common interests. We are now willing to maintain and strengthen the existing friendly and cooperative relationship with that country. We are also willing to enhance friendship with the Balkan Entente countries and other countries that have not yet signed treaties of alliance with Romania, especially the United Kingdom, Italy, and Russia. Furthermore, Germany and the countries adjacent to Romania are economically interdependent and have always maintained friendly relations with us. We will naturally continue to maintain them in the future. As for the League of Nations, Romania will continue to actively cooperate with it." (Havas, 2nd)</p>

<h3>How to Protect Beneficial Insects of Crops (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Wu Fuzhen, Dean of the College of Agriculture, Zhejiang University</p>
<p>(B) Speaking of larval parasitic beneficial insects, let's talk about two types: First, in rice paddies, we can often see parasitic wasps of rice stem borer larvae. This wasp lays its eggs inside the borer larvae. After hatching, it feeds on the nutrients inside the borer larva. When it grows up, it breaks through the borer's body wall and goes out to form small, yellowish-white cocoons on the rice leaves and pupates. These cocoons are often clustered in dozens, looking like grains of rice. This wasp is called the small cocoon wasp. This spring, when seedlings were transplanted in various places, farmers generally did not know that it was a beneficial insect, and they picked it off and killed it, which is a pity. According to investigations, 18 out of every 100 borer larvae are parasitized and die. Therefore, when we see it in the field, we must not destroy it, but should allow it to reproduce naturally.</p>
<p>Second, we all know that flies are harmful insects, but there is a type of parasitic fly that is a beneficial insect. Armyworms that harm wheat and millet (called grasshoppers in northern Jiangsu and armyworms in Hebei) are often parasitized and killed by parasitic flies. When armyworms migrate, this parasitic fly often flies around them and lays its eggs on their bodies. After the eggs hatch into larvae, they burrow into the body and absorb nutrients for growth. Armyworms that are parasitized cannot pupate and die midway. If we see white egg masses laid by parasitic flies on the backs of armyworms in the field, we should not kill them just because armyworms are pests, because these armyworms don't need us to kill them. The eggs laid on the worms by the parasitic flies will hatch into larvae and kill them. Otherwise, if we kill this kind of armyworm, the parasitic fly eggs laid on it will hatch into larvae, but because the host is dead, they will not be able to survive. As a result, we kill an armyworm but lose many parasitic flies—which are our helpers. Therefore, when we see this kind of armyworm, we should not only not kill it, but it is best to bring it back to the room and keep it in a fine-mesh green gauze cage for rearing, so that the parasitic flies can emerge and then be released into the wheat field to find hosts—armyworms—for laying eggs and reproduction.</p>
<p>(C) Pupa-parasitic beneficial insects. Pupae are also parasitized by parasitic wasps. The pupae of rice stem borers and rice leaf folders can often be found to be parasitized by parasitic wasps in rice paddies. Once the pupae of these two pests are parasitized by parasitic wasps, they cannot emerge into moths. Therefore, it is best not to kill the pupae and cocoons we collect. Put them all in a fine-mesh wire cage and let them emerge. The pupae that have not been parasitized by parasitic wasps can fly out through the fine holes after they become moths, but because their bodies are larger, they cannot fly out and die in the cage.</p>
<p>(D) Adult-parasitic beneficial insects. The reproductive power of aphids is very strong, as mentioned in the previous few days. Therefore, our earth has not been completely occupied by them. Although we humans destroy them, it is not as effective as the various natural enemies that kill them. We have already talked about several kinds of parasitic wasps above, and the one we are talking about here is also a parasitic wasp—an adult parasitic wasp. Although aphids are small, there are even smaller parasitic wasps that can lay their eggs inside them. After this egg hatches, it absorbs nutrients in the aphid's body to grow. When it matures, it turns into a pupa, then into a moth, breaks through the aphid's body wall and flies out, and goes to other healthy spiders to lay eggs. It goes without saying that this kind of parasitized aphid dies.</p>
<p>(II) Predatory Beneficial Insects</p>
<p>(1) Dragonfly. The dragonfly is a carnivorous insect. It eats only animal matter and not plant matter. Its larva - the nymph - can eat mosquito larvae - the wrigglers - in the water, helping us reduce mosquitoes. After it grows up, it flies everywhere, preying on various flies and moth insects. There are often especially many of them near rice paddies. As a result, ordinary people think that the dragonfly flying above the rice paddy and urinating on the rice leaves will turn into rice leaf folders, blaming the disaster of rice leaf folders on the dragonfly. This is a big mistake. We know that dragonflies can prey on moth borers and other rice pests. Not only are they harmless, but their contribution to protecting crops is truly great. We should do our best to protect them and absolutely prohibit catching them. Many children often like to catch dragonflies as toys, which should be dissuaded at any time. Also, when fishing, if you catch its larva—the nymph—you should always put it back into the water and never kill it arbitrarily.</p>
<p>(2) Mantis. The mantis is also a very great beneficial insect. Everyone knows that the mantis catches cicadas. In fact, the mantis not only catches cicadas, but also preys on all other pests. Therefore, we should also do our best to protect the mantis and not catch and kill it. The mantis's egg mass, the ootheca (called monkeys in Liaoning Province and urine lads in the Changzhou area), is often used as a medicinal material in Chinese medicine stores. Its eggs are often laid on tree branches to overwinter. Except when it is necessary to collect them as medicinal materials, we must not harm it arbitrarily.</p>
<p>(3) Ground Beetle. Armyworms are a very great pest. Wheat and millet everywhere are often eaten arbitrarily by it, causing great disasters. However, when armyworms are rampant, there is also a ground beetle larva that is prevalent. This insect has large, pincer-like mouthparts and specializes in eating armyworms in the field. It runs around at that time, simply recklessly. No wonder northern Jiangsu calls it angry. Our wheat and millet can have a good harvest, and ground beetles really have a part of the credit. How can we not do our best to protect them!</p>
<p>(4) Ladybug. Aphids are a very great pest of various crops, as I mentioned a few days ago. However, in places where aphids reproduce, there are often many ladybugs gathered. This ladybug specializes in preying on aphids. There are many kinds of ladybugs. Their backs are shiny and beautiful, and they have two, four, fourteen, and other different stars, so there are names such as two-star ladybug and four-star ladybug. Its shape is like a ladle we use to scoop water, which is why it is called a cotton ladybug. It is a carnivorous insect that does not eat plant matter, only aphids and other pests. Therefore, we must do our best to protect it. However, the twenty-eight-star ladybug, which eats harmful eggplant plants, is a pest and should not be protected, but should be killed anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p>(5) Aphid Fly. There is also an aphid fly (syrphid fly). It often lays its eggs on plants where aphids gather. After these eggs hatch into larvae, they prey on aphids for a living. Its method of preying on aphids is very special. It first drills its mouthparts into the borer's body, and then tries its best to absorb the nutrients inside. After the nutrients are absorbed, it changes to another one, and continues to absorb until it is full. Therefore, we can often see many empty shells of aphids in aphid colonies. Its adult, like a bee, often flies among the flowers. We must not catch and kill it.</p>
<p>(6) Aphid Lion. The aphid lion is also named because it can prey on aphids. Its eggs are laid on the leaves of plants. They are often clustered in dozens and supported by thread-like long stalks, which is very unique in appearance. After these eggs hatch into larvae, they prey on aphids and other pests.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned insects are all very famous beneficial insects of crops. We should protect them anytime and anywhere and never kill them arbitrarily.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a kind of spider, which is often regarded as a beneficial insect by ordinary people. In fact, it is beneficial to humans, but it is not an insect, but it is very similar to insects. There are many kinds of spiders, most of which can weave webs to prey on pests, so they should also be protected. This spring, many places implemented the work of collecting and removing borer egg masses in seedling fields. There were many spider egg sacs on the seedling leaves. Because ordinary farmers did not recognize them, they thought they were also borer egg masses that harmed rice, and they all picked them off the seedling leaves and killed them, which is really destroying our natural helpers, and it is a pity. In fact, borer egg masses and spider egg sacs are completely different. Even if we compare their colors, borer egg masses are brownish-yellow, and spider egg sacs are white, so we can distinguish them clearly.</p>
<p>Frogs are also called beneficial insects by ordinary people. Indeed, they can prey on crop pests and are beneficial to humans, but they are not insects and are very different from insects. We need to make this clear. (The End)</p>

News has arrived that approximately 1,000 infantry, cavalry, and artillery soldiers stationed in the Dongjuzi barracks in Tianjin began practicing marching and camping in the Heiniucheng Wangzhuangzi area south of Tianjin on the morning of the 2nd for four days. Night attack battles were held on the nights of the 3rd and 4th, and they returned to Tianjin on the evening of the 5th. In addition to these two exercises, small-scale exercises, such as street battles within the Japanese concession in Tianjin, are held once every day or two. Each time they are held, traffic is blocked, soldiers climb onto roofs to set up machine guns, as if facing a great enemy. The sounds of gunfire and cannons are mixed together, making every resident of Tianjin involuntarily recall the Tianjin Incident, and feel a chill down their spine. Since being strengthened, the Japanese army in North China has reached over 8,000 in number, still short of the 2,000 required for a mixed brigade formation. The original plan was to send them here on a regular basis, but due to attention from Europe and America, and protests from our side, the dispatch was delayed. Recently, due to a general lack of attention to this issue, they were transported secretly on a military supply ship on August 26th, landed at the South Beach of Yu Guan, disguised as a Yu Guan summer vacation team, and divided into four batches of approximately 140 people each on the 27th and 28th, and successively arrived in Tianjin and entered the Dongjuzi barracks. The new troops were formed by drawing a portion from various elite divisions in the country, and carried twelve heavy artillery pieces, eight 38-caliber field guns, thirty-six heavy machine guns, twenty-four heavy-duty trucks, three small motorboats, and two small blimps, totaling more than 570 people. The unit designation is the Independent Artillery Regiment of the North China Garrison Army. Its regimental commander, Colonel Suzuki, arrived in Tianjin on the night of the 31st, took office on the 1st, and visited various parties. The regimental headquarters is located in the new barracks in Dongjuzi, Tianjin. This is only one-fifth of the total number. It is said that more than 1,000 people will continue to be secretly transported in this way in the middle of the month. At the latest, the strengthening formation can be completed by the beginning of next month. The new troops in Tianjin are mostly stationed in the Dongjuzi barracks, but the water source in that camp is insufficient, and every time they drink it, they suffer from diarrhea. Therefore, the military headquarters used the name "Okura-gumi" to rent more than 600 mu of land at Liulitai, Nankai, across from the Sino-Japanese Middle School, next to the Daqing Chemical Society, to build barracks, and construction has been underway for a month. The Tianjin Municipal Government believes that the land is ours, and the Japanese side should not act without informing our side, and has sent personnel to negotiate and stop the construction, which was refused. It was answered that the land was purchased from local households, and everything was based on the wishes of the owners. However, after investigation, the households all cried out for injustice, saying that they were forcibly occupied and did not want to rent. The municipal government protested again a few days ago, but has not yet received a reply. If these barracks are built, there will be three Japanese military garrisons in Tianjin, and the increase in military strength is secondary. (2nd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Conspiracy to Invade South China Established an Immigration Company with a Huge Capital of 50 Million, Immigrating 100,000 to Engage in Fishing, Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Other Industries</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that after much preliminary effort, the Japanese have finally formed an immigration company in Taiwan with a capital of 50 million Japanese yen. The company plans to engage in fishing, animal husbandry, reclamation, and all related agricultural activities in Fujian and Guangdong. The company is expected to receive its business license around October 10th. There are already many such companies in Malaysia, Java, Sumatra, and the southern regions. The methods of invasion are appalling. The fishing industries in the aforementioned locations are all controlled by these companies. The Malaysian fishing industry used to be operated by Malays and Chinese in small, independent groups. Since being invaded by the Japanese, they have been organized and cooperated, and will soon be plundered completely. Their fishing method involves setting up nets between two sailboats. These sailboats never return to port. They cruise at sea at night, hauling up the nets every few hours. The fish caught are transported to major ports such as Singapore by high-speed gasoline boats, transported every few hours. The price is low and the goods are fresh. Although fishermen rest on schedule, the supply of fish is never interrupted. The company plans to transport 100,000 immigrants to Fujian and Taiwan provinces in the next five years to engage in farming using scientific methods, making it impossible for local farmers to compete and difficult to make a living, or turning them into immigrants elsewhere to find a livelihood. This year, in the planting of fruits in the Xiamen area, local Japanese farmers have used scientific methods to improve cultivation, and the harvests have been several times higher than usual, with profits reaching tens of thousands of [currency units]. Chinese farmers who grow fruits not only have no profit to gain, but also face freezing and starvation due to depreciation. A few years ago, when taking a public bus to Zhangzhou, one could see banana fields all along the way, endless and fruitful, with golden colors shining. But now, this industry has also been lost to the Japanese. Taiwanese bananas are imported duty-free, and Chinese bananas have been eliminated. The reason for the success or failure is that the Japanese have received considerable education and specialized training, while the Chinese are ignorant and follow old rules. One side is united and cooperates with each other to engage in invasion, while the other is like a plate of loose sand, so it is difficult to escape the natural law of survival of the fittest. If the Chinese wake up early and cooperate to save themselves, it is not too late. If they are still apathetic and live in a drunken stupor, then after five years, these 100,000 immigrants will arrive at their destination, establish a core of supreme power, be deeply rooted, and look down on everything. At that time, the Chinese will sink into a sea of suffering and have no hope of extricating themselves.</p>
<h3>Jinan Cracks Down on Bizarre Attire Chairman Han Personally Arrests Modern Women Arrested Women are Detained at Headquarters Awaiting Han's Interrogation</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Bizarre and foreign attire has long been strictly prohibited in Shandong Province. It was once rigorously enforced this summer, and the arrested modern women in bizarre attire have all been punished separately. It was hoped that the customs would be straightened to the right track and the habits would be pure and good. However, stubborn habits persist. The government showed a little leniency, and the women who were obsessed with modernity, while chanting about equality between men and women and not being playthings of men, their curiosity and love of novelty were able to overcome everything. At first, they wore long sleeves and trousers, but the sleeves were rolled up above the elbows, so that the general law enforcement police had no reason to question them. Later, they saw that this trick worked, so they gradually restored the old appearance, parading through the streets and revealing a lot of flesh. They ignored government laws and social accusations. Unexpectedly, today (the 1st), Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuju happened to go to Nanguan for business, and discovered a modern woman with short sleeves and exposed elbows on the way. He immediately arrested her, capturing Zhang Qingbo, Sun Ruiqin, Cai Hong, and others. The Public Security Bureau said that they continued to capture more than 50 people, including Zhang Yulan and Wang Meili, at key traffic intersections in various cities, and detained them all at the military law office of headquarters to await Han's interrogation.</p>

<h3>Suzhou Trends in National Assembly Elections in the Vocational Sector</h3>
<p>The vocational representative election in Suzhou has been very tense recently. The labor union has unanimously recommended Shi Zhifan. The Chamber of Commerce initially strongly supported Cheng, but Cheng expressed his intention to withdraw, so Zhang Shoupeng's election trend has improved. The silk and transportation guilds have held meetings and reached a unanimous attitude, recommending Zhang as a candidate. Zhang has recently contacted various counties, and the results are very satisfactory. Therefore, the election atmosphere in the local Chamber of Commerce has become unanimous in supporting Zhang.</p>
<h3>Li Hong Gas Boat Encountered Robbery</h3>
<p>The Li Hong gas boat, which travels between Suzhou City and Lili in Wujiang, set off from Suzhou on the afternoon of the 2nd. When passing by the Yishan Railway Bridge, a robber disguised as a passenger suddenly opened a box cannon and fired into the air to demonstrate, searching passengers for cash, etc., for about more than one hundred yuan. He forced the gas boat to dock and went ashore. Yesterday (the 3rd), the boat returned to Suzhou and reported to the relevant public security branch to request assistance in arresting him.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Embezzlement and Escape Arrested</h3>
<p>Wu Gucheng, an apprentice at Yongyuansheng Rice Shop in Sanliqiao, Beicheng, was ordered to take 3,425 yuan in goods funds to the Bank of Communications at about 1:00 p.m. on the 26th of last month to be remitted to Shanghai Yifa Shenzhuang for receipt. Unexpectedly, Wu saw the money and became greedy, and embezzled the money and fled. Then, his introducer, He Tianyu, traced his whereabouts from his biological mother, and reported to the Public Security Bureau's Criminal Investigation Team to request pursuit. After receiving the report, the newly appointed Criminal Investigation Team Leader Wang Zhongyun immediately dispatched detectives Dai Shouquan and Wang Bingsheng to lead detectives to Beijing and Shanghai to pursue. Wu Gucheng and his late father, Zhang Debiao, were arrested in Room 90, 18 Jia, Confucius Temple, Nanjing. More than 2,900 yuan in the original stolen legal currency was found in the leather suitcase in his room and was transferred together immediately. Yesterday, it was presented to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. At the same time, the detectives also found 92 yuan of the original stolen money in the grass shed near the Tailong Flour Mill in Nancangmen, where his mother, Wu, lived, and took it to the bureau for verification.</p>
<h3>Unveiling of Candidates for the Second Electoral District</h3>
<p>The selection of candidates for the National Assembly from the eight counties of the Second Electoral District—Wuxi, Wuxian, Changshu, Wujin, Wujiang, Jiangyin, Taicang, and Kunshan—was completed simultaneously in each county's district offices on the 31st of last month. All ballot boxes were sealed by the respective county governments and uniformly sent to the district office on the 2nd. District Supervisor Zang Qifang appointed the magistrates of the eight counties and Gao Yang, director of the Provincial Education Institute, as vote counting supervisors, the secretaries of the eight county governments as administrators, and other staff members were also assigned. The vote counting took place on the afternoon of the 3rd. This time, the eight counties comprised a total of seventy districts, one thousand and thirty townships, and three hundred and forty-one towns, totaling one thousand three hundred and seventy-one townships and towns. The total number of citizens was 316,848, and sixty candidates were to be selected. The results of the vote count showed that Li Tipi, An Jianping, Song Yongsün, Cai Ziping, Tang Ruilin, Feng Xiaozhong, Tao Guanshi, Hua Jinji, Hua Yanquan, and Xin Zenghui, all from Wuxi, were elected as selectors.

<h3>Changzhou: Temple Monks Request Exemption from Monthly Donations</h3>
<p>Qinghai and Cheng Lian, monks of Qingliang Temple and Tianning Temple in Wuyi County, respectively, reported that the Public Security Bureau had initiated the collection of monthly donations for temple buildings, sending personnel to each temple to record donations in registers. There was no prior announcement of the measures, nor any explanation of the nature of the donations. They verbally assessed the value of the buildings, instructed how many yuan should be paid each month, and recorded this in the registers before leaving. Considering that land rents are being reduced due to droughts and floods, and that chanting services are declining with the market, they jointly petitioned the provincial government to order the county to uniformly exempt them from these donations. The response received yesterday stated that the revised regulations for house donations in the province only stipulate two types of donations: shop house donations and residential house donations, excluding public welfare and charitable organizations that have already had their property registered. However, those who rent civilian houses are still subject to donations. The provincial government ordered the Wujin County government to investigate the circumstances of these temples' buildings, whether they rent civilian houses or lease their properties to others, and to handle the matter in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Progress of the Qiantang River Bridge Project</h3>
<p>The construction project of the Qiantang River Bridge is being steadily promoted and improved, and the work is becoming more active. Of the fifteen bridge piers for the main bridge, one has already been completed, and the remaining fourteen are floating caissons, thirteen of which have been poured. The remaining one is undergoing pouring and excavation. Of the nine foundation sites, only one remains to be worked on. Of the ten bridge piers for the north bank approach bridge, all but the second one closest to the river have been completed. All five bridge piers for the south bank approach bridge have been completed, with only one pier wall still under construction. All sixteen spans of the main bridge's steel beams have been transported to the construction site and are being assembled on the shore for installation using a floating vessel method. The steel beams for the approach bridges will be installed on site, and the road surface on top of the beams has also been constructed.</p>
<h3>Qiantang Tide Sweeps Away Spectators</h3>
<p>The tidal bore in Haining has been exceptionally large for several days. Yesterday (the 3rd) at 0:10 AM, the east and west tides converged, making the night tide even larger than the daytime tide. It surged in from afar, violently hitting the embankment, rising more than twenty feet above the sea wall. The steel-reinforced concrete railings and iron-legged chairs of the seaside park outside the South Gate were completely destroyed, and the corner of the waiting pavilion outside the East Gate also collapsed. Several houses were destroyed between the piers. Many travelers watching the night tide were swept away by the huge waves. Di Qunrong, a police supervisor, was critically injured by the force of the water and died at 7:00 AM. Two floating corpses were found in the sea when the tide receded in the morning but could not be rescued and were carried away by the waves.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Young Boy Kidnapped from the Hu Family Tomb</h3>
<p>Ye Pinfa, a resident of the Hu Family Tomb in Yinnan, makes tofu for a living. One night at 11:00 PM, two to four bandits broke into his house, each wielding a sharp blade. After ransacking the place, they were not satisfied and kidnapped Ye's six-year-old son, also sending a letter demanding a large ransom. The responsible police station is currently investigating and attempting a rescue.</p>

<h3>Suiyuan, the Frontier of National Defense</h3>
<p>— Shouzhuo</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the four northeastern provinces have fallen, followed by the autonomy of eastern Hebei. This spring, northern Chahar was lost without a fight. Recently, eastern Suiyuan has become extremely tense. It is evident that the northwest, which the nation has been watching, will become the first line of national defense after the northeast. Thinking of this, I am heartbroken. I, as a reporter, was ordered to travel north for ten days. I will now respectfully describe my observations in Suiyuan to the nation.</p>
<p>Suiyuan is located at the gateway to the northwest, serving as a shield for Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang. Bordering Mongolia to the north, it is also the key to the national border, occupying a very important position in national defense. However, the terrain is flat and undefendable. Since the events outside Kulun and the Bailingmiao Incident, Suiyuan's situation has become even more difficult. Moreover, from eastern Hebei to northern Chahar, and from northern Chahar to eastern Suiyuan, this is a predetermined plan of the invaders. Therefore, as eastern Hebei was being prepared for seizure, the Chahar Incident occurred; as northern Chahar was being prepared for seizure, the eastern Suiyuan Incident occurred. Clear-sighted people would know this at a glance.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the best way to invade is to entice with benefits and induce surrender. If enticement fails, then threats are used. If threats fail, then the internal is divided and harassed. If that still doesn't work, then force is used to conquer. The events in eastern Hebei and northern Chahar were a performance of this three-part play. The events in eastern Suiyuan are similar. However, there is one point that I can clearly tell the nation: based on recent observations, the performance of the three-part play has lost its effectiveness, forcing the enemy to implement the final approach. Although the recent situation in eastern Suiyuan is very quiet, the longer the period of quiet, the higher the degree of danger. This is something that all of us Chinese people should pay close attention to. The rulers should think deeply and plan ahead, and take preventive measures as soon as possible.</p>
<p>On the day I arrived in Guisui, Damiling Sulong, the commander of the bandit suppression in the four banners of eastern Suiyuan, also arrived in Guisui, staying at the Suiyuan Hotel. Through the interpreter, Mr. Hu Fengshan, he, as someone who had personally experienced the situation, spoke freely about the eastern Suiyuan Incident. According to him, this incident occurred on July 30th. On that day, several hundred bandits attempted to invade Taolin. After being repelled by the militia, they fled to Shangdu. On August 2nd, they gathered several thousand people and attacked again, making formal contact with our troops. After holding out for several days, they were defeated and retreated. Since then, the other side has realized that harassment is impossible and is currently preparing for a large-scale offensive, so they have not dared to attack again. According to him, the puppet troops coming from northern Chahar consisted of about a thousand Mongolian troops originally under De Wang, over a thousand troops under Li Shouxin, over a thousand troops under Zhuoshikehai, and several thousand troops combined under Bao Yueqing, Bao Guiqing, Wang Ying, and others, totaling about ten thousand people. However, most of them were a motley crew, so it was not too difficult to resist. However, after the bandits are fully prepared, and there is strong support behind the bandits, the defense will be extremely difficult. Mr. Da is forthright and his patriotic heart overflows in his discussions of the war. He is admirable.</p>
<p>I also visited Chairman Fu Zuoyi at the provincial government. The provincial government is located in Guisui New City—that is, Suiyuan City—about four or five li northeast of the old city—that is, Guihua City. The roads are well-built, neat, wide, and lined with green willows, and the air is fresh. The provincial government offices are combined and operate with reverence and beauty. Through the introduction of Mr. Chen Chongde, the secretary of the provincial government, I was immediately granted an audience, and we discussed the eastern Suiyuan Incident with great enthusiasm. That evening, I was invited to a banquet, specially inviting Prince Pan, Prince Kang, Chief Steward Rong, Chief Steward Ba, and Commander Da. All the princes could speak some Chinese, and Rong Xiang, the chief steward of the Guihua Tumote Special Banner, was even proficient in Chinese characters. There was much laughter and joy during the gathering. Generally speaking, the entire Suiyuan province, from Chairman Fu down, is determined to resist the eastern Suiyuan bandit rebellion. Suiyuan is lacking in both manpower and financial resources, but through hard work, all the people of the province are able to do their best for the country. The outcome may not be known, but the general phenomenon is extremely admirable. It is hoped that the central authorities will not fail to live up to their hard work, and that the people of the whole country will provide assistance, to protect the nation's talents, guard the territory, so that this northwest barrier will no longer fall into the hands of foreigners, and that there will be a future for the revival of every household.</p>
<p>Suiyuan's commerce has declined since the Kulun road was cut off and the Xinjiang road was obstructed. The provincial government's total annual income is only over 1.4 million, so its poverty is evident. On the way, I met Mr. Xu Baiyuan, the manager of the Tianjin Bank of Communications, who was also inspecting the branches in the northwest and the economic conditions of various places. According to him, there was a drought this spring and agricultural products were scarce. The export of agricultural products is the mainstay of the northwest, so the most important thing for the development of the northwest is to improve its water conservancy. This is truly an excellent point.</p>
<p>I also took a trip to the Zhao Jun Tomb. The tomb is located more than twenty li south of the city. Leaving the city, the roads are rugged and walking is difficult. The road is built of sand and is not yet fully completed. After traveling more than ten li, we reached the Black Water River. The river is spanned by a bridge, but the water is less than a foot deep. The so-called "Black Water Green Mound" refers to this place. After crossing the bridge, there is a stretch of flat sand, interspersed with green grass. As far as the eye can see, only dark clouds are surging. I imagined the tragic atmosphere of Zhao Jun leaving the border in those years. After walking for a while, we reached the tomb. There are eight steles in front of the tomb, with the "Han Mingfei Tomb" of the eleventh year of Daoguang being the oldest. The tomb is more than ten zhang high. Climbing the tomb and looking out, there is an endless plain. The sky is vast, and the earth is boundless. It is truly a mound of yellow earth, burying the beautiful bones. Reciting Du Fu's poem, "Once gone from the purple terrace to the northern Han, only a green mound remains facing the dusk," I could not help but feel infinite emotion.</p>
<p>I only stayed in Suiyuan for one day, but after returning to the residence, the impression of Suiyuan remains in my mind forever. I hope that my countrymen will never forget this frontline of national defense.</p>

<h3>Hurricane Swept Through Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon; Changed to a Northeastward Direction Towards Korea; Shanghai Had Gale-Force Winds, Light Rain, and a Giant Tide on Shore</h3>
<p>The new hurricane that recently arose in the South Pacific moved with alarming speed. By 10:00 AM yesterday, the hurricane had reached 28 degrees north latitude and 123 degrees 30 minutes east longitude, southeast of Wenzhou. The wind direction was north-northwest, blowing directly towards Shanghai. It was also the time of a high spring tide. Therefore, by about 9:00 AM, the Customs had already raised the black ball storm warning signal. At 11:00 AM, the Customs received a report from the astronomical observatory that the hurricane was advancing towards Shanghai, with the center of the wind force 60 nautical miles away and the wind force extremely strong. The Customs added another black ball to warn Chinese and foreign merchant ships in Shanghai to be on alert. The turbid waves of the Huangpu River were reaching the sky, and the river water was level with the shore. At 11:15 AM, the Customs fired three cannons to warn all ships to be prohibited from leaving the port. The Shanghai-Ningbo liners Xin Jiangtian and Ningxing immediately stopped selling tickets and loading cargo in the morning and changed to exporting on Saturday. The Haili also stayed in Shanghai and did not depart. The Taikoo's Haikou and Yunnan, which had already left, all anchored at the Wusongkou. The China Merchants Bureau's Haiheng sent a telegram stating that it was sheltering from the wind in Xiangshan Port, and the shipping routes were completely blocked. Even the Yangtze River ship Jiangshun was unable to load cargo because the wharf was submerged by water, and passengers requested a postponement. The bureau decided to delay the departure by one day, allowing it to export at midnight today. At 11:40 AM, the tide had reached the shore. Sichuan Road, Fuzhou Road, Hankou Road, along the Bund, were all submerged, and the Bund Garden was also completely submerged in water until about 4:00 PM. After 4:00 PM, the astronomical observatory reported that the direction of the hurricane had changed, bypassing Shanghai to the north-northeast, about 100 nautical miles away from Shanghai, and heading towards Korea. At this time, the wind had reached 122 degrees 50 minutes east longitude and 31 degrees north latitude, and Shanghai was spared from the storm. The various conditions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Violent Wind Force, Rapid Advance</p>
<p>The hurricane originated at 6:00 PM on the 1st of this month, advancing north-northeast with extreme violence and speed, unprecedented in recent years. At the beginning, it appeared to be stationary, but by the morning of the 2nd, it advanced rapidly. The speed of its journey, from 6:00 AM on the morning of the 2nd to 6:00 AM yesterday morning, was 660 nautical miles. The hurricane blew to the sea area of 124 degrees east longitude and 27 degrees north latitude at 6:00 AM yesterday morning. The center of the wind was 60 nautical miles, and it continued to advance in a north-northeast direction. At that time, it was about 240 nautical miles from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Afternoon Wind Direction Changed to Northeast</p>
<p>The wind speed has gradually slowed down since 6:00 AM yesterday morning. According to the astronomical observatory's second report at 11:00 AM yesterday morning, it had advanced to the sea area of 130 degrees east longitude and 28 degrees north latitude. The center of the wind was still 60 nautical miles, and the direction remained unchanged, 180 nautical miles from Shanghai. The third report at 2:00 PM stated that it had blown to the sea area of 130 degrees east longitude and 30 degrees north latitude. The wind speed had slowed down again, and the direction had changed from north-northeast to northeast. The center of the wind had shrunk to 30 nautical miles.</p>
<p>Swept Through Shanghai at 4:00 PM</p>
<p>Afterwards, the wind became even more severe, and everyone thought that the port of Shanghai would inevitably be hit by the storm. However, at that time, the atmospheric pressure in the port of Shanghai suddenly changed, and the direction of the wind also changed to due north, or northeast. As a result, the area of this city was fortunately spared from the storm, and swept through the sea area 100 nautical miles outside Wusongkou at about 4:00 PM. According to the fourth report issued by the astronomical observatory at 4:00 PM, the center of the wind was still 30 nautical miles, blowing to the sea area of 122 degrees 50 minutes east longitude and 31 degrees north latitude, in a direction of due north or northeast, predicting that it would violently attack the Korean coast.</p>
<p>Giant Tide Ashore, Astonishing Amount</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the high spring tide and the passage of the hurricane, the tide rose astonishingly. At 11:00 AM, it had already exceeded the 11:30 AM tide forecast of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau, rising rapidly in advance. At 11:30 AM, the tide was rapid. At 12:34 PM, it rose rapidly. At 1:29 PM, it was fully risen. The highest tide at 11:30 AM exceeded the forecast of 11 feet 6.5 inches, reaching 12.5 to 13 feet. The speed of the water flow at each point reached approximately 2.2 nautical miles. It began to recede at 3:50 PM, with a maximum height of 13 feet, the highest record of the year.</p>
<p>Low-Lying Areas of the City a Vast Expanse</p>
<p>The Bund outside Jianghai Customs, Sichuan Road, Hankou Road, Nanjing Road Bund, Edward Road Bund, Nanjing Road Zhejiang Road, both banks of the Suzhou River, Alabasters Road, Bank of China warehouses, Zhejiang Industrial Bank warehouses, Broadway Road on the Bund, Wuma Road, Niuzhuang Road, Yunnan Road, Sima Road, French Concession Maiserdi Road, Sapore Road, Marang Road, Nanshi Railway Station Road, Local Hall, National Goods Road, Bansongyuan Road, Gaochangmiao Road, Xuejia浜, and the surrounding alleys were all ankle-deep in water, a vast expanse. The warehouses were fortunately not flooded due to prior flood prevention.</p>
<p>Air and Water Transportation Affected</p>
<p>Yesterday, from morning to dusk, this port was constantly hit by gusts of wind and drizzle, and the climate was already like late autumn. When the hurricane swept through Shanghai, the rain and wind were even stronger, and the waves in the Huangpu River were huge. Smaller boats sailed into the Suzhou River to temporarily avoid the wind and waves. All export liners from this port yesterday, which were related to the hurricane, were postponed. Import merchant ships were also delayed in arriving in Shanghai. The Shanghai-Guangdong mail plane of China National Aviation Corporation also did not depart. The electric</p>

<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Telegrams Song Zheyuan to Inquire About the Truth of Consumption Taxes; Rumor Has It That Another Inspection Office Has Been Set Up in Tianjin; National Goods Manufacturers Already Affected</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed Song Zheyuan yesterday, which reads: To Chairman Song of the Beiping Hebei-Chahar Political Council. The issue of smuggling in North China involves the lifeblood of national finance, the integrity of tariff rights, and the survival of industry and commerce. All citizens of the Republic of China are eagerly hoping that it will not worsen. Your Excellency sits in the north, a pillar of the nation, and you must be worried and anxious about this situation, hoping that the central government will adopt a diplomatic stance and find a comprehensive solution. It is rumored that another inspection office has been set up in Tianjin, which will levy a tax of one-eighth of the tariff on smuggled goods, allowing them to circulate within Hebei and Chahar. This clearly follows the precedent of the one-quarter tariff collected privately in eastern Hebei. It is a reckless speculation and not worth refuting. However, domestic goods manufacturers have been considerably affected because the northern gangs dare not take action. In order to maintain the market, our chamber requests that your council indicate the truth to dispel doubts. This is convenient for everyone. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce bows. Jiang and Che were unable to operate from 3:30 PM to 6:00 PM and were temporarily stopped at the Waitanyao Bridge. Private cars burned electric lights and honked their horns, advancing slowly one after another. Shops throughout the city also traded with the lights on.</p>
<p>Two Ships Destroyed Near Baotaiwan</p>
<p>Since 12:00 noon yesterday, Wusong experienced a sudden high tide. In addition, the northeast wind was strong, the water flow was rapid, and the waves were monstrous. The surging conditions caused panic. By 1:30 PM, the tide of Yuncao River was level with the outer Ma Road, and the south bank was a vast expanse of water, turning into a marshland. Near Baotaiwan, one pig boat and one jellyfish fishing boat were destroyed by the wind and waves. In addition, many cargo ships anchored on the Pudong beach suffered losses due to drifting anchors and broken chains. The highest tide yesterday rose to 40 feet on the customs gauge.</p>
<h3>Xin Jiangtian Wheel Workers' Strike Resolved: Explaining the Greater Good and Encouraging Unity; Six Ring Leaders Fired</h3>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Bureau's Xin Jiangtian Wheel, which operates on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, had over 250 stewards. Last autumn, they were divided into two shifts to implement new operational training. It was agreed with the bureau in advance that the workers would return to work on the original wheel after training. When the first batch of trainees returned to the wheel and the second batch continued to go ashore for training, the bureau's attitude suddenly changed, and it planned to assign the class of stewards to other wheels. Labor and management had a dispute, and the details were repeatedly reported in the newspapers. At the request of the workers, the Seamen's Union upheld justice and maintained work. The union then filed a negotiation with the bureau, but the bureau firmly refused. With the approval of the Central People's Training Committee, the Ministry of Transportation, and the four-party representatives of the bureau and the union, it was jointly decided that all stewards in the first and second shifts would return to Xin Jiangtian, and the shifts would be worked without prejudice. All parties were satisfied, and the labor strike was over. However, the first batch of workers serving on the wheel suddenly expressed disagreement and refused to allow the second batch of workers to board the wheel to work, causing new waves between labor and labor. The second batch of workers requested the union to maintain their work. After the union repeatedly persuaded the first batch of workers, explaining the greater good and encouraging unity, and with the bureau's approval, the six ringleaders of the first batch of workers were fired. The long-standing Xin Jiangtian stewards' strike, which had been unresolved for years and had caused repeated disturbances, was completely resolved. The first batch of workers went ashore to do shift work on the Yangtze River wheel, and the second batch of workers returned to Xin Jiangtian to work. The handover was implemented a few days ago. From then on, one and two batches of workers will rotate monthly, alternating with each other.</p>
<h3>Hebei-Chahar Political Committee Levying New Taxes: Shanghai Yarn Association Cables for Suspension; Tax Rate Only One-Eighth of Current Tariffs; Trade Barriers Will Be Destroyed and Industry and Commerce Will Inevitably Collapse</h3>
<p>The Hebei-Chahar Political Committee recently drafted new tax rates for goods transported to Tianjin. The United Association of Chinese Cotton Mills, considering the importance of the matter to national industry and commerce, submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry, and sent a letter to the Cotton Industry Control Committee, which reads: According to today's newspaper, the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee has decided to levy a new tax on goods transported to Tianjin from September 1st, which is equal to one-eighth of the current tariff. Goods that have paid this tax will be protected by the authorities. The description is brief and the details are unknown. However, judging from this measure, its impact on domestic industry and commerce is not insignificant, and its impact on the cotton industry is particularly great. It is known that the cotton industry has been declining in recent years. The only thing that has allowed it to barely struggle is the increase in import tariffs, which has reduced the pressure of foreign competition on domestic products. However, since the emergence of smuggling in North China, the situation has changed dramatically. Factories that have stopped work or reduced work have sprung up one after another. Fortunately, the central government has vigorously stopped it, slightly reversing the decline. However, Hebei and Chahar have taken new tax measures. If the newspaper report is true, the tax rate is only one-eighth of the current tariff, and it is lighter than the current yarn and cloth unified tax. Foreign yarn and cloth will inevitably be imported in large quantities from North China and transferred to the south. Our country's tariff barriers will be completely destroyed, and industry and commerce will inevitably collapse. Even if we take a step back and say that this new tax is a local tax of Hebei and Chahar, and that those who transfer it from Hebei and Chahar to other provinces must still pay taxes as usual, it is not known that the factories in Hebei and Chahar will obtain extremely cheap raw materials and manufacture goods, which will be dumped in the south, which is enough to restrain the mission of each factory. Please quickly consult with the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee to stop the new tax in order to maintain the national economy. We are very grateful.</p>

If anyone has indeed taken the oath but has not obtained a citizen certificate, they should quickly describe the facts within the next two days and request the office to investigate and issue one, so as not to lose the right to elect.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Journalist Representatives: Candidates to be Elected in This City on Schedule; This Month, the 6th, from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM at the Journalists Association of This City</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Journalists Association received an order from the Shanghai Municipal National Assembly Representative Election Office yesterday, which stated that in accordance with the National Assembly Representative Election Headquarters and the National Assembly Independent Professional Groups Representative Election Headquarters (successively issuing orders to handle the election of representatives from independent professional groups in this city, it should be complied with.

<h3>You Lie Sends a Telegram to Li and Cai, Urging Them to Cherish Past Glory and History, Tolerate Private Grievances, and Resist National Enemies Together</h3>
<p>You Lie, a veteran revolutionary and old friend of the late Mr. Sun Yat-sen, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong. The day before yesterday (the 2nd), he telegraphed Li Jishen and Cai Tingkai in Nanning. The original telegram reads: "Respectfully sent to brothers Li Renchao and Cai Xianchu in Nanning, greatly admired. It is regrettable that brother Xianchu suddenly entered Guangxi without prior notice. Since the changes in the two Guang provinces, the national foundation has been endangered. Fortunately, comrades in eastern Guangdong rectified the situation. It is hoped that Mr. De Lin and Mr. Jiansheng will maintain their sincerity in protecting the party and saving the country, put aside private grievances, and support unification. Even if the central government's handling is not perfect, it should be accepted with an open mind. How can we rashly resort to arms at a time of national crisis and take a step backward? Recently, I read in the newspaper that the Guangxi army is attacking Guangdong. It is shocking to hear that brother Ren is serving as a fighting advisor, and brother Xian is serving as a pioneer. Is the glorious history of the past going to be used for a desperate gamble in a civil war? If this is true, it is very painful. It must be known that unification is the only way to resist foreign aggression, which is what the people of the whole country desire. If one abandons the public and acts alone, the result will inevitably be failure. The Fujian incident can serve as a warning. The brothers have joined the ranks of right and wrong. The principle is not right, and the strength is not sufficient. Remembering when brother Ren held power in the two Guang provinces, and Mr. De Lin was in charge of the two Hunan provinces, and brave men from up and down the Pinghan line gathered under Mr. Jiansheng, at that time, they controlled half of the country. What could not be done? In the end, because the measures slightly violated public opinion, they still could not avoid failure and escape. Now, wanting to resist the whole country with a small corner of Guangxi, the outcome of victory or defeat, why wait for divination? I hope that the brothers will not take this as an outlet, and jointly persuade Mr. De and Mr. Jian to restrain the military, drive away reckless guests, tolerate private grievances, and resist national enemies together. I have explained the situation in detail. I hope you will consider and accept it. Yun Lie Dong."</p>

<h3>Tang Shaoyi Returns to Shanghai; Mayor Wu and Others Welcome Him</h3>
<p>Mr. Tang Shaoyi, a member of the Central Committee, returned from Lushan with his wife and sons Liu, Zhu, and Liang. He took the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s "Gonghe" ship. He passed through Nanjing the day before yesterday afternoon, without stopping, and came directly to Shanghai. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 10:00 AM yesterday morning, but it arrived earlier at about 8:00 AM and docked at the Shuntai Wharf on East Broadway Road. The city's Mayor Wu Tiecheng, the director of the Municipal Treasury Wu Zixiang, Tang's son-in-law Jiang Haiman, the superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, Gan Hansen, the comprador of the Gonghexiang Wharf, and many others went to the ship to welcome him. After landing, Tang first went to Gan Hansen's residence on East Broadway Road for breakfast, and then went to the Xin Ya Hotel on Tiantong Road to rest. According to Tang Zhu, speaking to a reporter from the New Sound News Agency, "Whether my father will stay here in Shanghai for a long time after returning, or whether he will go to Guangdong or elsewhere, depends on whether the climate in Shanghai is suitable for his health. It is currently undecided," he said.</p>

<h3>The Haili Steamer Damaged Three Lighters When Leaving Port; Two Sailors Were Swept Away by Huge Waves While Carrying Cables</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Haili" steamer, at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, finished loading goods and passengers in Shanghai and cast off to Qingdao. It was during high tide, and the steamer had just left the dock and was moving forward when suddenly five small steamers appeared in front of the bow,</p>
<p>Obstructing the Waterway</p>
<p>The captain of the "Haili," Teng Shibiao, seeing that the five steamers neither stopped nor gave way, knew that if the steamer steered to the right, it would have to collide with a Taikoo ship. If it moved forward, these five small steamers would inevitably be sunk. Although the boatmen of each small steamer were to blame, they would all be drowned. Captain Teng, to avoid the greater evil, decided to steer the "Haili" inward to give way, in order to save the five steamers, while also considering avoiding contact with the Taikoo ship. He also reversed the engine. At the time, three loaded lighters were moored in front of the Jinliyuan Wharf. The stern of the "Haili" reversed and</p>
<p>Violently Struck the Three Lighters</p>
<p>Among them, lighter No. 6463, loaded with over 1,400 crates of bananas, was hit the hardest. The hull immediately capsized, and the cargo and boatmen all fell into the Huangpu River. Lighters No. 26633 and No. 6274 were also struck by the stern of the "Haili," although they did not sink, and over a thousand crates of bananas in the holds were also dumped into the river. The damage to the hulls was significant. As for the boatmen who fell into the water, they were fortunately rescued by people on the dock. Immediately after the accident, the dock immediately reported it to the General Bureau, and the bureau quickly sent specialists and engineers to</p>
<p>Conduct an On-Site Inspection</p>
<p>And inquire about the circumstances of the accident. The inspection revealed that the dock was not damaged, and the damage to the three lighters was not the fault of the "Haili." Captain Teng's maneuver to avoid hitting the lighters preserved what was substantial. The "Haili" was ordered to supplement its report, so that it could be forwarded to the insurance company. As a result, the "Haili" could not depart immediately and had to remain in Shanghai temporarily and anchor. At the time, a hurricane warning had been issued by the customs, and a strong wind was blowing from the Wenzhou coast. The "Haili" was ordered to temporarily moor to the river pilings in front of the Jinliyuan Wharf. At 11:00 AM, the second typhoon signal was hoisted on the customs roof. The "Haili" then released its steel cable. Two sailors from the Jinliyuan Wharf, Sun Guoshun and Chen Aiqing, were sent out at 11:02 AM in a</p>
<p>Sampan to Carry the Cable to the River Pilings</p>
<p>The wind and waves were very large, the tide was swift, and there was heavy rain. Sun Guoshun and Chen Aiqing braved the wind and waves to reach the center of the river, just as they were about to carry the "Haili"'s steel cable to the pilings. Unexpectedly, the wind was fierce, the waves surged, and the tide rose. Sun and Chen were standing in the sampan. A wave came, and both men lost their footing and were knocked into the river at the same time, immediately sinking to the bottom of the river. The sampan boatman shouted, and the "Haili" crew saw it and quickly sent out boats to search in all directions. The two sailors had already been swept away by the rapid current, and it was not known where the waves had taken them. As a result, their bodies were not recovered, and others were assigned to carry the cable. The report was made to the General Bureau in the afternoon. In addition to sending people to search for the bodies again, the bureau will give pensions after the bodies are found. The "Haili" steamer will be exported today.</p>

<h3>Industrial and Commercial Loan Association Approved Small Loans Totaling 4,050 National Currency</h3>

All the approved cases will be notified to the applicants by the association for verification and collection of the funds. It is also reported that the association is still accepting applications for small loans, and there are many people who come to the association's office on the second floor of the China National Products Bank on Tianjin Road to obtain application forms.</p>
<h3>Issuance Reserve Management Committee Recovered Banknotes from Zhejiang Xingye and Other Banks; Issuance of Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks Increased Sharply; Subsidiary Coinage Certificates Issued by Local Banks</h3>
<p>Since the banknotes of the Central, China, and Communications Banks were designated as legal tender, and the banknotes of the Farmers Bank of China were specially approved to be used in the same way as legal tender, the reserves of other banknote-issuing banks were all taken over by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee. Now, the Central, China, and Communications Banks' legal tender is issued at any time according to market needs. As of the end of August, the Central Bank issued 30,595,5375 yuan, the China Bank issued 36,742,5895 yuan, and the Communications Bank issued 20,647,6451 yuan. As for the total amount of banknotes issued by the Farmers Bank of China, it is 10,000,000 yuan. However, the banknotes previously issued by nine banks, including Zhejiang Xingye, China Industrial, China Agricultural and Industrial, China General Commercial, China Reclamation, Zhejiang Local, Siming, Farmers and Merchants, and Central South (i.e., the Four Banks), have been gradually recovered by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee. Currently, the number circulating in the market is very small, and after a considerable period of time, they will be completely recovered. It has also been decided that after the reorganization of the Central Bank into the Central Reserve Bank is successful, it will specialize in operating the national treasury, keeping the reserves of various banks, storing all public funds, providing the convenience of rediscounting to various banks, and no longer engaging in ordinary commercial banking business. It will enjoy the exclusive right of issuance two years later. Therefore, in the near future, only the Central Bank's banknotes will circulate in the market. Regarding the issuance of subsidiary coinage certificates, it will be handled by provincial banks, such as the Zhejiang Local Bank in Zhejiang Province, the Jiangsu Farmers Bank in Jiangsu Province, the Anhui Local Bank in Anhui Province, and the Jiangxi Yumin Bank in Jiangxi Province.</p>

<h3>China Paper Mill Project Submitted to the Boxer Indemnity Board for Discussion; Construction Can Begin Immediately After Passage; Preparatory Office Moving to Beijing for Departmental Approval</h3>
<p>The China Paper Mill project proposal was submitted to the China Engineering Society by the preparatory office of the mill at the request of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board. It has now been completed and the society has expressed its agreement with the plan, and is drafting an opinion letter. After the research committee signs it, it will be sent back to the preparatory office to submit to the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board for approval. Construction can begin immediately after approval. It is reported that the new head of the preparatory office, Zhou Yichun, recently came to Shanghai to inspect the site and discuss with the preparatory committee. Most of the matters to be handled in Shanghai have been completed. In the future, regarding the construction of the mill, it will be necessary to contact the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board at any time. For convenience, it is planned to move the preparatory office to Beijing and submit it to the department for approval. When the company is established in the future, it will still be located in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Society: Work Relief Ended Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Society, which was established in 1934, handled work relief in various parts of Zhejiang. It was originally scheduled to end in 1935, but because some of the work relief projects were not completed, it was postponed until August of this year. A total of over 310,000 yuan was raised in donations, all of which was used for expenses such as rice, flour, and straw mats for relief. The society decided that the relief projects had been completed and announced the end of the society yesterday. It also printed and distributed a credit record report book for distribution to donors to verify.</p>
<h3>The Reason for the Debt of the New Pharmaceutical Industry</h3>
<p>The representative of the New Pharmaceutical Industry creditors returned to Shanghai from Zhenjiang, as reported yesterday. According to Yuan Guansong, the Supervisory Committee member of the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the debt of over 31,960 yuan mentioned in yesterday's newspaper regarding Shanghai only refers to Zhongwai Pharmacy. Other debts in Shanghai related to Taihe Pharmacy amount to 32,458.935 yuan. Therefore, the total is as high as 64,420.0702 yuan. After filing a lawsuit with the Wuxi Local Court for this debt, a judgment order of 204 and 105 of the 24th year of the Republic was received, ordering Taihe and Zhongwai Pharmacies to repay the debt in full. According to the latest interpretation of the Military Commission, the revenue from the "Regulations for the Punishment of Drug Trafficking" is limited to those who have no rights other than the criminals. Now, Taihe and Zhongwai Pharmacies in Wuxi owe over 64,000 yuan to Shanghai. Most of their assets, including pharmaceuticals in stock, were taken from creditor pharmacies and are unpaid commodities. The wholesale price is the entire guarantee for the debt. Now, if they are all confiscated at once, the rights of the creditor pharmacies will be greatly harmed. The Provincial Security Headquarters believes that there is indeed a reason for this, so they have agreed to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Chinese Agricultural Loan Syndicate Discusses Loan Measures for Anhui; Peng Yin-xuan to Return to Wuhu to Oversee Loans; Flexibility to Be Allowed if Loans Exceed One Million</h3>
<p>The Chinese Agricultural Loan Syndicate and the Anhui Provincial Finance and Construction Departments have agreed to a one million yuan loan for agricultural warehouse storage collateral, designating 24 counties including Fengyang as loan areas. Peng Yin-xuan, the director of the Syndicate's Anhui office (and manager of the Bank of Communications' Wuhu branch), arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. Three executive directors of the Syndicate, Zou Bingwen, Li Zhongchu, and Wu Nanyuan, hosted Peng at a banquet at the Bank Club on Hong Kong Road at noon yesterday to discuss loan measures for the Anhui Agricultural Association's storage collateral. The loan measures, in addition to complying with the regulations stipulated in the contract between the Syndicate and the Finance and Construction Departments, state that once the warehouses in each county are completed, the Anhui Agricultural Warehouse Management Office will notify the Syndicate, which will send personnel to inspect the warehouse facilities. For the initial warehouse loan, the warehouse will sign an overdraft agreement with the Syndicate, and subsequent loans will require farmers' storage collateral certificates. This year, Anhui Province has reported bumper harvests of rice and wheat. To aid the rural areas, it has been decided that lending will commence as soon as the warehouses are completed, which is expected to be by the end of the month in all counties. If future loans exceed one million yuan, flexibility will be allowed to increase the total loan amount. Mr. Peng has decided to return to Anhui to oversee the loan matters.</p>

<h3>Labor Strife Escalates in Britain and the United States; All Machine Workers Leave Factory Yesterday; Party and Government Mediation Rejected by Factory</h3>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports that all workers at the Third Factory of the British American Tobacco Company on Taopeng Road in Pudong (now known as Gu Zhong Tobacco Company) have gone on strike to protest the harsh treatment by Chinese Manager Wei Ziqian and the unwarranted dismissal of more than 400 employees in recent months, which has triggered a strike wave that has lasted for more than ten days and remains unresolved. All workers in the machine department left the factory. Party and government officials sent representatives to mediate yesterday morning but were rejected by the factory. All employees of the factory have established a strike committee to demonstrate long-term resistance. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Machine Workers Leave Factory</p>
<p>After 2,600 male and female workers in various departments of the factory, such as cigarette leaf stuffing, boxing, canning, and tin packaging, went on strike on August 18, the workers still went to the factory as usual but did not work. Subsequently, direct negotiations between labor and management failed, and the workers all left the factory and officially went on strike. However, workers in the machine room, such as stoker, firemen, coppersmiths, and janitors, remained at the factory. As the dispute has dragged on until now without resolution, these workers, to show solidarity, have also all left the factory starting yesterday, willing to stand with all workers, their attitude being extremely firm.</p>
<p>Refused Mediation</p>
<p>As the labor dispute at British American Tobacco has lasted for many days without resolution and the stalemate affects local security, the city's Party and government agencies, upon receiving a report from the workers, dispatched Fan Guoren, a cadre from the Civil Movement Section of the Municipal Party Committee, and Zhu Jintao, a staff member from the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, to the factory yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to mediate. However, they were rejected by the factory, resulting in their return without success. The officials have reported to the relevant committees and bureaus to convene both parties to the bureau according to the Labor Dispute Handling Law for mediation.</p>
<p>Supervisory Measures</p>
<p>Provisional Measures for Supervising Communist Party Surrenderers: (1) These measures are formulated to supervise the actions of Communist Party surrenderers, prevent their recidivism, and promote their sincere rehabilitation. (2) All Communist Party members who have been approved for surrender by the Communist Party Surrender Case Review Committee of this city, or Communist Party members who have been approved for surrender by similar agencies in other places and have moved to this city (hereinafter referred to as "surrenderers"), shall be supervised in accordance with these measures. (3) Surrenderers shall submit a written report in the first ten days of each month, reporting their actions in the past month. The format of the report shall be specified by the committee.

The format of the report shall be specified by the committee. (6) If the above two reports have been submitted for more than one year, and the committee, after assessment or upon request of the surrenderer, believes that the surrenderer is indeed not at risk of recidivism, it may allow them to be exempted from submitting one or both reports. (7) If the guarantor of the surrenderer discovers that the guaranteed surrenderer has committed a relapse, they shall immediately report it to the committee or the relevant agency for verification. (8) The committee may notify the surrenderer to come to the committee for an interview at any time, and the surrenderer shall not refuse on any pretext.

<h3>Rickshaw Guild Lists Reasons for Not Reducing Rickshaws; Letter to Chinese Directors Asking Them to Negotiate with the Public Works Department</h3>
<p>Due to the Public Works Department's recent proposal to reduce the number of rickshaws, the Concession Rickshaw Guild has listed reasons and sent a letter to the Chinese Directors to negotiate. The various sentiments are as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to Chinese Directors Requesting Negotiation</p>
<p>The guild yesterday sent a letter to Public Concession Public Works Department Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing, Jiang Yiping, Guo Shun, Xi Yushu, Xu Xinliu, etc., requesting them to negotiate with the Public Works Department to avoid the reduction. The original text stated: "Respectfully, upon investigation, regarding the case of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee's proposal to reduce the number of rickshaws, our guild has listed the reasons and sent a letter requesting assistance. Subsequently, the case was resolved to be retained on file, demonstrating your excellencies' concern for the Chinese business community and the hardships of the poor people. We are extremely impressed. We have now heard that the Public Works Department is proposing to reduce the number of rickshaws again, as if they will not stop until their goal is achieved. We are shocked to hear this. We respectfully list three points below (recorded separately). In summary, rickshaws are of great importance to social needs and the livelihoods of the poor. Whether the Public Works Department directly cancels rickshaws or indirectly restricts the number of rickshaw pullers to eliminate rickshaws, it is not what they advocate. We earnestly request your excellencies to consider the future of society and the livelihoods of the poor and give us reasonable arguments to strive for in order to dispel the proposal to reduce the number of rickshaws. Then the rickshaw industry will be fortunate, and society will be fortunate. We eagerly await your orders with anxiety."</p>
<p>Three Reasons Why Rickshaws Cannot Be Reduced</p>
<p>The guild listed three reasons why rickshaws cannot be reduced: (1) Reducing the number of rickshaws is a consistent policy of the Public Works Department and it was decided in 1924 to reduce 500 vehicles each year until 1915, when the number would be reduced to 5,000. However, this policy has not been implemented because implementing this policy goes against the facts. Today, hundreds of thousands of people rely on rickshaws for a living. In this time of economic depression, once the number of vehicles is reduced, the society will suddenly increase by tens of thousands of unemployed people, which is not a blessing for society. Today, more than one million people in Shanghai rely on rickshaws for transportation. Although motor vehicles are developed, they are not sufficient for the use of all citizens. Therefore, reducing rickshaws has a major impact on social needs. Moreover, government and industry are based on human feelings and facts. Policies that do not conform to human essence and facts do not necessarily need to be insisted on. This is one reason why vehicles cannot be reduced for the sake of social needs and the livelihoods of the poor. (2) Regarding the issue of rickshaws obstructing traffic, the number of public rickshaws has not increased in the past ten years. During this period, the number of private rickshaws has increased to more than twice the number. There are currently more than 20,000 private rickshaws operating in the concession, which is more than twice the number of public rickshaws in the concession. The Public Works Department does not seek to restrict private rickshaws, but only advocates reducing public rickshaws, which is incomprehensible. Moreover, restricting or reducing private rickshaws only affects one person per vehicle, and the small number of rickshaw pullers who become unemployed as a result can be accommodated by public rickshaws. Public rickshaws affect a large number of passengers and the livelihoods of many rickshaw pullers. Once the number of vehicles is reduced, it will be impossible to solve the livelihood problem of this large unemployed population. Moreover, in fact, the obstruction of roads by rickshaws is far less than that of trams and buses. The Public Works Department only tolerates this while wanting to eliminate the other, which is puzzling. This is the second reason why rickshaws cannot be reduced from the perspective of transportation. (3) Rickshaws pay more than 200,000 yuan in taxes each year, which is more than one-third higher than the tax amount paid by public buses and trams, which are franchise businesses. Their obligations to the municipal authorities are considerable. Moreover, rickshaws are deeply related to the future of society and are of great importance. For the sake of municipal tax revenue and the future of society, rickshaws cannot be reduced.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Orders Promotion of Sweet Potato Planting</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry instructed the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau: "The Secretariat of the Executive Yuan previously sent a letter stating that Li Zhenhan had submitted a request to order all provinces to actively plant sweet potatoes to solve the national food problem, which should be handed over to the Ministry of Industry for consideration and handling, etc. A copy of the original document was attached and sent to you for your reference. In addition to replying to the letter, the central agricultural experiment was issued to review the matter. According to the reply, sweet potato crops are easy to plant and grow very easily. They can be used as vegetable soup for meals, and as a substitute for rice and wheat to fill the stomach, and can also be used as raw materials for making alcohol. In this extraordinary period, in order to prepare for food self-sufficiency and liquid fuel self-sufficiency, promoting the planting of sweet potatoes is a key plan. After verification, it is still necessary, in addition to issuing separate orders, to copy and issue the original presentation of Li Zhenhan, and request that you forward it to all agricultural institutions under your jurisdiction to promote sweet potatoes, and first engage in crop breeding experiments and promote excellent varieties, so as to improve production. This order is issued by Minister Wu Dingchang."</p>
<h3>Hurricane Collapses House; Li Jingeng's Family Escapes Unharmed</h3>
<p>Li Jingeng, a farmer from Lijiata in the west of Hongqiao Town in western Shanghai, is very poor. His five-room tile house, which he lives in, is very old and dilapidated. It was unexpected that during a storm and heavy rain at about 2:00 PM yesterday, the house suddenly creaked. Li's whole family panicked and fled outside. Before long, the house completely collapsed with a crash. Fortunately, it was during the day, and no people or animals were injured.</p>
<h3>For the Readjustment of the Chinese Buddhist Association - An Announcement to Monks and Nuns Nationwide (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Tinghao</p>
<p>(1) Regulations stipulating that monks and nuns must join the association and laypersons may not join the association.</p>
<p>Some say that joining the association should be the freedom of monks and nuns. They do not know that this association is a special religious group. If it is not organized, then so be it; if it is to be organized, then all monks and nuns nationwide must be forced to join in order to rectify the monastic rules and gradually cultivate the special spirit of Chinese Buddhists in preparation for protecting the Dharma and saving the country. Moreover, bar associations and accounting associations have already made compulsory membership regulations. If it is said that there are practical difficulties, then President Sun Yat-sen has a legacy of instruction: "Knowing is being able to do." Knowing but not doing is not really being unable to do, but rather not having the sincerity to do it. "Sincerity" is the basic condition for being a Buddhist. How can one be a Buddhist and not know the principle of "sincerity"? As for laypersons not being allowed to join the association, this does not mean that laypersons are not allowed to be Buddhists. It should be known that among the seven assemblies of Buddhism, their attainment of the fruit of enlightenment is originally different, and their positions are also different. Moreover, the articles of association stipulate that laypersons may be hired as Dharma protectors, so although laypersons may not join the association, their duty to uphold the Dharma is not hindered in the slightest. Perhaps some may say that the words "be hired" seem to imply unfair treatment. In fact, these two words, from the positive side, are precisely intended to encourage laypersons to be enthusiastic about protecting the Dharma, and from the negative side, they are precisely intended to prevent ambitious elements who are not what they seem from mixing into the Buddhist Association. Or perhaps some may say that monks and nuns do not have experience in handling affairs, so it is necessary for laypersons to join. That would mean that monks and nuns are voluntarily and permanently in a passive position, permanently unwilling to improve their ability to handle affairs and implement self-government. Moreover, according to the principles of monastic rules, laypersons cannot directly manage affairs. Buddha said, "With a wish, success is certain." If monks and nuns are unwilling to uphold the Dharma, then why is there a need for a Buddhist Association?</p>
<p>(2) Regulations for expelling monks and nuns from membership and ordering them to return to lay life.</p>
<p>A country has its laws, and a religion has its rules. If the laws and rules are not strict, then the foundation will not be solid. Therefore, those who break the law should be punished, and those who violate the rules cannot go unpunished. Moreover, punishing one as a warning to a hundred seems to be unkind to the punished, but it is not necessarily unkind to the entire Buddhist community and all monks and nuns. The reason why monks and nuns can be called the Sangha Jewel is that they are able to strictly uphold the precepts. If monks and nuns can abide by the articles of association and monastic rules and have no faults, people will not have enough time to respect them, so why fear being punished?</p>
<p>(3) Regulations for supervising the income and expenditure of temples and nunneries and making finances public.</p>
<p>The property of temples and nunneries is originally the public property of the ten directions. Those who live in the temple have the duty to manage and organize it, but not the right to consider it as private property. Moreover, Buddhist monks and nuns are not allowed to privately accumulate wealth, which is one of the Buddhist precepts. As abbots, how can they know the precepts and violate them? As for supervising income and expenditure, the association is practicing self-government as an initial step towards rectification, and the government has inherent powers. The purpose of religious property is originally to support monks and nuns in their practice and to engage in propagating the Dharma and benefiting others. If the abbots use it properly, without selfishness or corruption, then why fear supervising income and expenditure and making finances public? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>People Arrested in Pudong Shantytowns Prosecuted Yesterday; Total of 12 Charged with Disturbing the Peace; Penglianhui Issues Statement of Facts Seeking Assistance</h3>
<p>At 9:40 AM the day before yesterday, the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council, together with Chinese detectives Liu Wenzao, detectives Jin Wanrong, Liu Changgen, and Western detective Cleighton of the Yangshupu Police Station, and Western inspector McNarn from the Works Department's Engineering Office, went to 448 Chaoyang Road to execute an order to demolish. Unexpectedly, the shantytown residents refused and gathered a crowd of four to five hundred people, using bricks, stones, bamboo poles, and manure to beat and throw, and damage vehicles. As a result, Yangzhounese Wang Lukuan, Pudongnese Zhou Azhang, Jiangbeinese Hong Aliu, Zhou Jinbang, Yang Shiyi, Wang Xiaosan, Sun Hankui, Gu Siming, Gu Luotian, Hu Guangyu, and women Lou Wangshi and Zhang Shishi were arrested, totaling twelve people. They were taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, filed a public prosecution based on Article 150 of the Criminal Law for disturbing the peace, requesting an extension for further investigation. Deputy Inspector McNarn, an Englishman from the Engineering Office, claimed that on August 28, he went to the site and saw that shantytown 448 had collapsed and was being rebuilt, violating the previous contract. He stopped the demolition. The next morning, he went there again and saw that it had been completed and notified them to demolish it, and warned Ji Yunsheng, a representative of a part of the Shantytown Federation, that they had set up. He promised to demolish it within 30 days. Unexpectedly, on the 31st, he went to inspect again, but it had not been demolished. On the first of this month, he went with the Chinese and Western police and asked the workers to automatically demolish the house, but the work was not carried out due to heavy rain, and they only went yesterday morning. Unexpectedly, a crowd of four or five hundred people used barbaric means to throw bricks, stones, mud, and filth at the public officials and beat the detectives. His right leg was also injured. According to Western Detective White Lake, the main culprits in this case were the defendants Wang Lukuan, Hong Aliu, and Sun Hankui, who took the lead. At the time, he personally witnessed the defendants Wang and Hong Aliu injure the arms of the Indian detectives at No. 410. The defendants Zhou Azhang, Zhou Jinbang, Yang Shiyi, Wang Xiaosanzi, Sun Hankui, Gu Siming, Gu Luotian, Hu Guangyu, and others all threw bricks and stones. There were also 20 women who all held chamber pots outside to help the men throw at the Chinese and Western detectives. The defendants Lou Yangshi and Zhang Shishi were among them. The car that the police went to arrest people was also damaged by the crowd with bricks and stones. When questioned, the defendant Wang Lukuan denied participating in the assault and hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. The male and female defendants Hong Aliu and others gave vague testimony. Judge Xiao Bianfen decided to remand them separately for seven days for further investigation. The following is the news from the shantytowns obtained by the New Sound News Agency:</p>
<p>Continued Petitions</p>
<p>The shantytown residents of Chaoyang Road, because of the many injuries caused by this bloody incident, are deeply concerned that they have no protection and demand that the demolition be avoided and the housing problem be completely resolved. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, representatives Tang Anping, Zhu Yuchang, Hu Yumen, Sun Weijin, Jiang Shanchang, etc. continued to petition Public Works Department official He (De Kui), who told the shantytown residents that they should not disturb each other and wait quietly for the board of directors to discuss and resolve the matter. The representatives then went to a northern company and made the same statement of petition to Chinese Director Yu.</p>
<p>Letter for Negotiation</p>
<p>The Municipal Shantytown Federation sent a letter to the Public Works Department for negotiation yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, at 9:30 AM yesterday morning, the Yangshupu Police Station led a large team of Chinese and Western detectives and more than 80 workers, riding in police cars, with a menacing air, to forcibly demolish shantytown 448 on Chaoyang Road. The nearby shantytown residents panicked and inquired about what was going on with the police chief and requested that the demolition be avoided. Unexpectedly, due to language barriers, there was a misunderstanding. All the Chinese and Western detectives abused their powers and brutally beat the unarmed shantytown residents, resulting in more than 40 injuries. Unexpectedly, the police station in charge arrested many of the injured and, on the morning of the 3rd, transferred them to the court to prosecute them for openly disturbing the peace under Article 150 of the Criminal Law. Thinking about the fact that the shantytown residents have been innocently beaten and then unreasonably arrested afterwards, and now they are being accused of unwarranted crimes, it is truly a brutal means of destroying the coolies, which is more than this. Our association is heartbroken that the day of subjugation is approaching and cannot remain silent. Therefore, after an emergency meeting, it was resolved: (1) Request the Public Works Department to stop the demolition. (2) The detectives are derelict in their duties and should be temporarily punished. (3) Guarantee that the same thing will not happen again in the future. (4) Release the arrested poor people within 24 hours. (5) The injured should be responsible for medical expenses and compensation for losses by the Public Works Department. The record is on file, and we respectfully submit the case for your perusal, hoping that you will consider the shantytown residents as the poorest people in the city, do not favor private interests, and approve the implementation of the above resolutions of our association to appease the public anger. We deeply hope and pray."</p>
<p>Request for Assistance</p>
<p>The Shantytown Federation also issued a statement of the facts and requested assistance from all sectors, stating: "The shantytown residents' request to avoid demolition has been made for two months, and the Public Works Department has not yet made a clear statement. Our shantytown organization and federation are all proceeding in accordance with the regulations. In August, the shantytown residents suffered from summer rainstorms and the thatch was rotten, and we repeatedly asked our federation to find a way to repair it. In order to remedy this and to be cautious, we printed a repair book with two copies. The repairer reported to both the Public Works Department and the Shantytown Federation, and only after the investigation was qualified could the repair be carried out. Otherwise, we would not be responsible. Therefore, the shantytown at No. 448 was old, the walls had collapsed, and the house was dilapidated, and we repeatedly decided to request repairs. Our association sent Wang Tongyi and Ji Yunsheng to measure the width and narrowness of the old site and started repairs. Therefore, after receiving the report, we filled in the permission and reported it to the Works Bureau. It happened that the Public Works Department was demolishing an illegal thatched house that day, and it was allowed on the spot. This was on August 27. Unexpectedly, on the 29th, an order was suddenly given to demolish it. The shantytown residents were shocked and asked our association to find a way. Our association held a meeting to discuss it, and it was decided that this house had been handled in accordance with the procedures and there was no violation of the regulations. If it was demolished because of repairs, our thatched house would have no hope of survival. Therefore, on September 1, we again asked the First Special District Citizen's Association and the Taxpayer's Chinese Association to send a letter to the Public Works Department to handle it slowly. We have not yet received a reply. Yesterday (the 2nd), the Public Works Department immediately ordered a total of more than 80 Chinese and Western detectives to lead the workers to demolish it. The shantytown residents, upon hearing the news, all held the heart of lip-to-teeth cold. It is being repaired and still being demolished. We will all have a day of perishing together. Therefore, the shantytowns pushed Sun Hankui and Ji Yunsheng to request a postponement and wait for the board of directors to resolve it and the superiors to handle it. They did not wait to finish speaking before they took out their police batons and beat them wildly. Sun Hankui was the first to be injured and fell to the ground. Seeing that the situation was not good, the shantytown residents could not avoid it, and more than 40 people were injured before and after by more than 80 detectives, regardless of whether they were shantytown residents or not. The seriously injured were dying, and the injured were taken to the police car without being sent to the hospital and detained in the police station. Thinking about our shantytown people being in such a difficult situation and suffering such a tragedy, how can we be at ease? Therefore, we have specially stated the true facts and respectfully ask all sectors to treat us fairly and find a way to help us, and to seriously negotiate with the authorities in the concession to achieve the purpose of punishing the murderers and ensure that the same thing will not happen again in the future. Our shantytown residents will tie grass and repay your kindness and will never forget your great virtue. This is our tearful announcement."</p>
<h3>Long Dormant Case of Japanese Sailor: Two More Suspects Apprehended, Police Gathering Evidence</h3>
<p>Cantonese individuals Yang Wendao, Ye Haisheng, Zhou Sherong, and others, were accused of the suspected murder of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo on Douanle Road on November 9th of last year. The case was concluded by the First Special Court, but due to crucial evidence requiring further investigation, the debate was retracted, and the investigation is still ongoing. It has come to light that the Special Political Department of the Public Concession General Inspectorate has discovered that Zhu Guisheng (29 years old) from Yangzhou and Jin Daoquan (19 years old) from Jiangbei are suspected of involvement in the Nakayama Hideo murder. They are also potentially related to the murder of Japanese man Xuan Sheng near North Sichuan Road on July 10th of this year. With the assistance of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, Zhu and Jin have been apprehended and taken into custody at the Dixiwei Road Police Station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court, where the police lawyer Zhang Shizhu, in accordance with Articles 76 and 101 of the Criminal Procedure Law, requested their detention. Judge Xiao Xiefen conducted the interrogation. Due to the police's ongoing evidence collection and secret investigation, the hearing was not open to the public. After a brief questioning by Judge Xiao, he ordered their detention and scheduled a subsequent hearing for further review.</p>
<h3>Passenger Jumps into the River from the "Gonghe" Steamer: Student Returning from France Unsuccessful in Finding Employment, Commits Suicide by Jumping into the Yangtze River in Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>The "Gonghe" steamer of Jardine Matheson, returning to Shanghai from Hankou yesterday morning, encountered a tragic incident of a passenger committing suicide by jumping into the river near Zhenjiang. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Seeking Employment in the Capital</p>
<p>A Mr. Zhou, residing on Lixian Gua Street in this city, in his thirties, was a student who had studied in France. He had worked at a French newspaper and the French Municipal Council in Shanghai. Having been unemployed in recent years, Mr. Zhou went to Nanjing to seek employment and find a way out. However, things did not go as planned, and his efforts were unsuccessful. He became depressed and developed a skin disease on his back, falling ill during his travels. Upon receiving the news, his father, with paternal affection, ordered his daughter-in-law to go to Nanjing to persuade her son to return to Shanghai for medical treatment.</p>
<p>Husband and Wife Returning Together</p>
<p>The Zhou family is quite wealthy. After Zhou's wife received her father-in-law's order and arrived in Nanjing, she immediately persuaded her husband to return to Shanghai quickly. Originally, she suggested taking the Shanghai-Nanjing train, but Zhou had already made up his mind to end his life. He falsely claimed he would travel by boat and boarded the "Gonghe" steamer. He initially purchased a second-class cabin with meals, but later upgraded to a first-class cabin with meals.</p>
<p>Suicide by Jumping into the River</p>
<p>As the ship passed Zhenjiang, around midnight, Zhou suddenly wanted to go out to the deck to take a stroll. His wife accompanied him outside, and they walked and talked together. The two walked to the side of the ship and leaned against the railing. Taking advantage of his wife's distraction, Zhou suddenly jumped into the Yangtze River and committed suicide. When his wife noticed and cried out loudly, the captain was informed and immediately ordered the ship to stop. A sampan was quickly launched, and people were sent to search for him. However, in the vast expanse of water and the rolling river currents, his body was nowhere to be found. After about an hour of unsuccessful searching, the ship continued on its journey.</p>
<p>Report Back to Shanghai</p>
<p>Zhou's wife, unable to save her husband, was also in such grief that she wished to follow him into the river. She was repeatedly restrained by the ship's staff. Yesterday morning, at about 7:00 AM, the "Gonghe" steamer arrived in Shanghai. In addition to reporting to the company, the ship's compradore sent someone to escort Zhou's wife to the Zhou residence on Lixian Gua Street in the South City, to explain to her in-laws the circumstances of her son's suicide by jumping into the river, and to advise them to pay attention to their daughter-in-law.</p>
<h3>Zhu Leifu, All Alone: Suicide by Hanging or Strangulation? Su Changsheng and Others Accuse Xiao Hongxiang, Requesting the Prosecutor to Open the Coffin and Examine the Wounds</h3>
<p>Zhu Leifu, 37 years old, from Jiangyin, was unmarried and without family. He had been working at the Tianyi Factory in Pudong for many years. He had accumulated 200 yuan in hard-earned wages, which he deposited with his fellow townsman, Xiao Hongxiang, who lived in the house of Shu Rong in Yinxianggang. Recently, Zhu became ill and stayed at the home of his fellow townsman, Bao Quanlang. Needing money for medical treatment, he asked Xiao to return the deposited funds. However, Xiao had malicious intentions and embezzled all the money, leading to an argument between Zhu and Xiao. Zhu returned home in anger, and his illness worsened. He summoned his uncle, Su Changsheng, and friend, Bao Quanlang, to his bedside, where he tearfully recounted the embezzlement of his savings and stated that he would have to go to Xiao's house to demand the money, even if he had to be carried there, and that he would rather die than give up. However, Zhu Leifu died at Xiao's house. Afterwards, Su Changsheng, Bao Quanlang, and others investigated and discovered that the deceased had first argued with Xiao, then fought, and was ultimately beaten by Xiao's accomplices. They strangled him with a rope from a well bucket and claimed that he had died by suicide by hanging. They did not report the death for examination and hastily prepared the body for burial, concealing the matter. Now, Su Changsheng has discovered that Xiao Hongxiang is a Communist Party leader. He was arrested by the Jiangyin County Government for the murder and arson case in Hengmen Township two years ago and sentenced to three years and six months in prison. Not long after his release, he resorted to the vicious tactic of embezzling funds and strangling someone to death. Several days ago, he hired someone to draft a complaint and submitted it to the Shanghai District Court, requesting that the accused be arrested and that Zhu Leifu's coffin be opened to examine the wounds, along with a private prosecution to console the wronged soul.</p>
<h3>University Students Accused of Murdering a Cook: Hearing Held, Hou Chuansan Requests Witness to Continue the Hearing</h3>
<p>He Cangyun and Li Gan, students at St. John's University in Zhabei, Shanghai, had a conflict with the cook, Zhang Yuanquan, on June 15th because they found a fly in their egg fried rice. They were fined one yuan as a week's deposit. Later, on July 18th, Zhang Yuanquan wanted to return the one yuan but verbally abused He and Li, causing He to punch him, resulting in Zhang falling and injuring his head, leading to his death. The Shanxi Road police station detained He Cangyun and Li Gan and handed them over to the District Court for trial, indicting them for causing death through injury. Yesterday morning, Judge Xie opened the court to hear the case. According to He Cangyun's testimony, he is seventeen years old, from Guangdong, and studying at St. John's University. On June 15th, because Li Gan finished his major exam and didn't have time to eat, he went to the small kitchen to order a bowl of egg fried rice, costing two jiao. However, when Li was eating, he suddenly discovered a fly in the rice. Considering hygiene concerns, he negotiated with the kitchen, and Li took one yuan from the table as a deposit. If no illness occurred within a week, the money would be returned. On July 18th, Li borrowed a book from me, a book borrowed from the library and then borrowed to Li, who came to school to return it to me. At that time, I walked past the kitchen, and Zhang Yuanquan and Pu A'kui came to demand the one yuan. Li said to him to hand over at the dormitory, Zhang scolded them to be robbers and bandits, snatching things and so on, so I slapped him in the face. Afterwards, he called seven or eight people to beat us. Seeing that there were many of them, we ran away. Later, they caught up with us, and I was knocked unconscious. I don't know how Zhang Yuanquan fell and died. Li Gan testified, stating that he is twenty years old, from Jiaxing, Zhejiang, and that his testimony was the same. Then, the witness Pu Along testified that he is twenty years old, from Liuhe, and works in the kitchen at St. John's. On July 18th at 1:00 PM, the two defendants walked by, and the kitchen owner asked Li to return the one yuan, which led to an argument. The defendant surnamed Li snatched the deceased's straw hat, and the defendant surnamed He slapped the owner in the face. After being hit, the owner sat blankly on the orange (likely bench), and they took the book and left. The owner asked them again, and the defendant surnamed He hit him again, and the owner fell to his death. As for the wound on the head, the large one was from the injury. At this point, the defense lawyers for the defendants, Jiang Yiping, Shi Kuan, Liang Yaobing, etc., stated that the deceased called seven or eight people to beat the defendants. At that time, he fell down himself, and his head hit a stone, causing his death. They requested to summon two students and a tea server from the school as witnesses. At this point, the judge then approved a change of date to summon three witnesses for further questioning. The defendants were released on bail of 10,000 yuan in cash, pending further interrogation.</p>

He was traveling north from Fangxie Road and, while turning at the Chongqing Li intersection, the bus stopped abruptly due to excessive speed and mechanical failure. The bus overturned a rickshaw, injuring the rickshaw passenger, Madam Tang Pu, a 28-year-old woman from Suzhou, causing head injuries.

Yesterday, the Shanxi Road security guard Yang Jingwan reported to the District Court. The prosecutor, Lei, and the coroner arrived at the scene to conduct separate examinations, confirming that the deaths were caused by being run over.

<h3>Adultery and Assault Case in a Leather Goods Shop: Apprentice Testifies to Everything, Hearing Adjourned for Further Investigation</h3>
<p>Ren Liqun, 47 years old from Jiangxi, is engaged in the leather goods business. He owns the Hengfengxiang Leather Goods Shop at No. 313 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. He also co-owns the Wuhonglong Leather Goods Shop at No. 344 Avenue Edward VII in the Public Concession. Ren is usually stationed at Hengfengxiang, entrusting the management of Wuhonglong to his wife, Ren Wang. Ren Wang is required to stay overnight at Hengfengxiang after closing the shops each day. Ren and his wife have been married for over ten years, and their relationship has generally been harmonious. They had four children, but all have died prematurely. Recently, Ren noticed a sudden change in his wife's behavior, as she began returning to the shop late at night. Suspicions arose, and around 11:00 PM the night before last, Ren went to inspect the Wuhonglong Leather Goods Shop because his wife, Wang, had not yet returned. Upon arrival, he found the shop door closed but unlocked. He pushed the door open and saw his wife and the bookkeeper, Wei Rongshou, lying together on a</p>
<p>canvas bed</p>
<p>in the shop. Their clothes were disheveled, and the buttons of Wang's undergarments were undone, indicating clear adultery. Ren was enraged upon seeing this and rushed forward to slap Wang twice in the face. Wang resisted, leading to a scuffle. At that moment, Wei Rongshou grabbed a small pair of scissors and came forward to assist, stabbing Ren Liqun in the thighs and ribs. Shop employees shouted and alerted the No. 166 Chinese constable, who arrested Wei and Wang, along with the scissors, and took them to the Central Police Station for detention. Ren Liqun was sent to Hôpital Sainte-Marie for examination and</p>
<p>minor injuries</p>
<p>Treatment and bandaging were provided, and he was soon discharged. Yesterday morning, the police escorted Wei Rongtao and Ren Wang to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian charged them with assault under Article 177 of the Criminal Code and adultery under Article 239 of the same code, recounting the above circumstances. Ren Liqun testified that Ren Wang is his wife, they have been married for over ten years, and last night, he saw his wife and Wei sleeping together on a canvas bed. As soon as she saw him, she</p>
<p>got up to put on clothes</p>
<p>her vest was unbuttoned, and her underwear was around her knees, so undoubtedly, they committed adultery. So, I twisted my wife, unexpectedly Wei then took the opportunity to stab me with scissors. When questioned, Wei Rongshou stated that the Wuhonglong Leather Goods Shop was originally opened by Ren Liqun and four others. Because Ren did not manage the shop and was addicted to vices, he and Ren Wang jointly operated the business. Ren then held a grudge and</p>
<p>fabricated allegations</p>
<p>In addition to strongly denying the adultery, he claimed that Ren's injuries were self-inflicted. Ren Wang also denied committing adultery with Wei. Finally, witness Chen Changsheng, 17 years old, an apprentice at Wuhonglong Leather Goods Shop, testified that last night, he was already asleep when he suddenly heard cries for help. He saw that the landlady's clothes were untidy, and both Wei and Ren were shop owners, and Wei and the landlady often joked and teased each other. Judge Zhan Liangce ruled that the case required further investigation and ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody, with a rescheduled hearing for next Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Old Prisoners Extort and Assault New Inmates After Failing</h3>
<p>Prisoners Yang Wenchang, Gui Jinhu (both murderers), Zhu Jinhai, Hu Shenglong, Xue A'gen, and two other individuals in the Second Special District Prison and the Second Special Court Detention Center at Masinan Road extorted Zhao Taotao and Fang Dalang (both defendants in a kidnapping case undergoing a third trial appeal) demanding 30 yuan each. When the demand was not met, the five men took advantage of an opportunity and ganged up to assault Zhao and Fang. The guards discovered and stopped the assault, reporting it to their superiors. The five men were handed over to the Second Special Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation, which filed a public prosecution with the Criminal Court. The afternoon before yesterday, at 3:00 PM, Judge Chen Shuoying opened the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. Prosecutor Wang Ren first presented the indictment, followed by Zhao and Fang, who testified about the extortion attempt and the subsequent assault. The five defendants, Yang, and other individuals testified that the prison's treatment was poor, and they intended to request improvements from the warden. Zhao Taotao and Fang Dalang opposed speaking on behalf of the inmates, accusing them of violating regulations, and thus harboring resentment and causing arguments. After reviewing the testimonies, the court ordered further investigation and scheduled another hearing. The defendants and victims were returned to prison pending further proceedings.</p>
<h3>High School Student Huang Qiluan: Record of Sleeping with a Dance Hostess: A One-Night Stand Not Leading to Marriage, Mother and Daughter Sue for Decency Offense</h3>
<p>Zou Cuifei, a sixteen-year-old dance hostess at the Shunfeng Dance Hall on North Sichuan Road, lives with her mother, Zou Loushi, at No. 115 Ruifuli, Tangjia Lane. In February of this year, Huang Qiluan, residing at No. 29 Wusong Road, a student at Yuqing Middle School in Jiangwan, was young, romantic, and fond of entertainment. Therefore, whenever he had free time after class, he would often visit dance halls with his friends. One day, while dancing at Shunfeng, he met Zou Cuifei and</p>
<p>Embraced and Huddled Together</p>
<p>They immediately felt like old friends. Huang had a friend named Lu Bin, who lived at No. 57 Avenue Edward VII and was also a regular at the Shunfeng Dance Hall. Lu had a close relationship with another dance hostess, Yu Ying, at the same dance hall. On the night of March 30th of this year, Huang and Lu went to Shunfeng together, choosing partners to dance with. With beautiful women in their arms, their enthusiasm for dancing was intense, and they danced until 5:00 AM the next morning, when they finally became tired. Huang Qiluan and Lu Bin, along with Yu Ying, Zou Cuifei, and Zou's cousin, Jin Mei (also a dance hostess), went to the Lanting Restaurant on North Sichuan Road for a meal,</p>
<p>Chatting Lovingly Over Drinks</p>
<p>They were very happy. However, Zou Cuifei was not good at drinking, so after a few cups, she became intoxicated. At that time, Jin Mei intended to send her home, but Yu Ying thought that it was already late and asked Jin Mei to go back first. Yu Ying would take responsibility for escorting Cuifei home. After Jin Mei left, Huang hired a car from the Hongkou Motor Company, helped Cuifei into the car, and went with Lu and Yu to the Hongkou Grand Hotel, where they booked rooms, numbers 128 and 138, each with their own partner,</p>
<p>Living in Separate Rooms</p>
<p>At that time, Huang Qiluan, taking advantage of Zou's intoxication, forcibly defiled her. Afterwards, he even talked about marriage. Who knew that after a one-night stand, Huang abandoned Zou. Although Zou sometimes met Huang at the dance hall and urged him to fulfill his promise, Huang instead accused Zou of having another lover. In a fit of anger, Zou booked a room at the Hongkou Grand Hotel on August 8th and secretly took sleeping pills, intending to commit suicide. Fortunately,</p>
<p>She Had Not Taken a Lethal Dose</p>
<p>The overdose was discovered early, and the hotel tea server reported it to the Hongkou Police Station, which immediately sent her to the hospital for treatment, saving her life. At that time, the police did not know Huang's address and could not investigate, so no public prosecution was initiated. However, her mother, Zou Loushi, learned about this and hired lawyer Lu Shidao to file a self-prosecution with the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing Huang Qiluan, Lu Bin, and Yu Ying of violating Articles 221 and 227 of the Criminal Code, offenses against decency. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhong Qing presided over the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. The three defendants</p>
<p>Did Not Surrender Themselves</p>
<p>According to the testimonies of Zou Cuifei and her mother, the above circumstances were stated, claiming that they suffered Zou Cuifei being raped once by Huang Qiluan. The witness Jin Mei also proved that they had the same meal at Lantin, and that Miss Zou was drunk, and that the tea person of the Hongkou Hotel said that the tea server of the Hongkou Grand Hotel Jin Hong Kui said that Lu Bin was a regular in the inn, where Lu and others came together in the daytime, and the one two-eight room was gathered and talked about.</p>
<p>Many men and women</p>
<p>They came to the same place and first opened the 128 room for a gathering, and then opened the 138 room, but they could not remember the tenants. The Zhong Judge approved and recorded that the examination on the issue of Zou's rape should be tested, and Zou was ordered to go to the court physician's office to check Zou on the fourth day (ie today). The case was scheduled to be heard again after the detainees were summoned to the court.</p>
<h3>McTaggart Road Discovery: Female Corpse in a Sack, Seventeen Knife Wounds All Over, Appearance Suggesting a "Blacklisted" Person</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 4:30 AM, a Chinese constable patrolling McTaggart Road in Hongkou suddenly noticed a sack on the roadside, which aroused his suspicion. He tried to lift it and found it unusually heavy, with bloodstains. Upon opening it, he was shocked to discover a female corpse, covered in knife wounds and soaked in blood. The woman appeared to be in her forties, with her hair in a bun, wearing a blue striped white cotton shirt, small blue striped trousers, gray cotton socks, and blue cloth shoes with bound feet. Her appearance suggested she was a "blacklisted" person. Alarmed, the constable immediately reported the situation to the police station via telephone. Detectives were dispatched to investigate and found a packet of morphine tucked inside the corpse's shoe. An examination of the body revealed as many as seventeen knife wounds: one on the neck, four on the throat, seven on the right hand, one on the left wrist, one on the chest, two beside the right breast, and one on the right leg. The gruesome sight was unbearable to witness. The police used a vehicle to transport the corpse to the morgue, awaiting an autopsy by the court. The body was photographed for record, and an investigation into the case was launched to apprehend the perpetrator.</p>

<p>Qu Zhenhua Resigns from the Rice Industry Executive Committee</p>
<p>Qu Zhenhua, an executive committee member of the Shanghai Rice Dealers Association, resigned from the association yesterday. His original letter stated: "To the esteemed association, the members' meeting was adjourned twice in a row. After I, Zhenhua, was ordered to reorganize it, the meeting was successfully convened at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce on August 20, and the number of attendees even exceeded two-thirds of the members, which was an unprecedented event since the establishment of the association. I am celebrating the successful reorganization and can finally take off my burden. Moreover, I am ashamed of my dullness and intended to retire quietly. However, at the general election, I was mistakenly elected by the members as an executive committee member, which makes me deeply apprehensive. I have been a mediocre member for ten years without any achievements. The seniors have been fair in their work, and the members have benefited a lot in recent years, which has made a deep and admirable impression on our colleagues. After this election, the committee is full of famous figures. I, a slow horse, want to follow them, but I am afraid of falling behind. Moreover, I am self-aware of my lack of talent and have been busy with my own affairs in recent years, with little time to spare. Rather than occupying a vacant position and not contributing anything, it would be better to retire early and give way to the capable. Therefore, I am stating the facts directly to avoid causing any mistakes. I sincerely hope that you will understand my personal feelings and approve my resignation so that I can fulfill my wish and avoid delaying the association's affairs. Thank you very much," etc.</p>
<p>Wang Shilong, the Assassin of Shao Wenbin, Arrested</p>
<p>Apprehended in the Xin Kang Li on Xin Zha Road, He Has Been Transferred to the Second Special Court for Interrogation</p>
<p>Shao Wenbin, a native of Pudong who was once a Banghuang opera performer and later ran a large gambling house for flower arranging, also known as Ma Fu A Liu, was assassinated on Huage Nie Road in the French Concession at around 8:00 PM on July 28, 1933. At that time, the detectives pursued the murderer and shot one of them dead. Later, the French police arrested an accomplice, Zhang Bingrong, nicknamed Xiao Ningbo, a native of Ningbo, and handed him over to the Second Special Court. After the first instance trial, he was sentenced to fourteen years in prison. He appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, which changed the sentence to life imprisonment. He appealed again to the Supreme Court, which upheld the original sentence. In his appeal, Zhang confessed that Shi Laohu, Lu Laoqi, and others discussed and instructed Wang Shilong, who was still at large, to go and kill Shao. Subsequently, the French police arrested Shi Laohu and Lu Laoqi, but they were not prosecuted due to lack of evidence. Wang Shilong was ordered to be arrested, and it was not until the day before yesterday that the French police received a tip-off that Wang Shilong, also known as Wang Shirong, 41 years old, a native of Danyang, who was involved in the assassination of Shao Wenbin, was hiding in the Xin Kang Li on Xin Zha Road in the Public Concession. Therefore, Inspector Gellerich (transliteration) and Chinese detectives Li Tonghua and Sun Zhaorong from the Western Precinct, along with detectives from the Xin Zha Police Station, went to the address at 9:00 PM that night and arrested Wang Shilong. He was taken into custody and transferred to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon. Judge Wang Gangzhao interrogated him. First, Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the police department, stated the case, saying that the defendant was arrested for the assassination of Shao Wenbin in 1933, and the police department needed to conduct a detailed investigation and requested that the defendant be detained for two weeks to investigate the case before filing a lawsuit. Then, the Chinese and foreign detectives in charge of the case reported the circumstances of the defendant's arrest. After the court verified the information, Wang Shilong was interrogated about his age and origin, and then he was ordered to be detained pending further investigation and interrogation.</p>

<p>Zhengdao Layman has been in Shanghai for ten years and has recovered from serious illnesses repeatedly. More than two hundred celebrities and literati have inscribed couplets as gifts of gratitude for his medical services.

After extensive investigation for two days, there was no clue to be found. It was not until 1:00 AM yesterday that Dr. Wu suddenly called his home, saying that he had returned. He hired a car and returned to his residence. After arriving home, he looked exhausted. According to him, he hired a rickshaw to go to Daxin Street that day, but after walking a few steps, the rickshaw overturned and he fell down, losing consciousness. When he woke up, he was in another place. Because he had been away from Shanghai for many years, he was unfamiliar with the routes and could not tell the direction. It was not until late at night the day before yesterday that he walked from the northern suburbs of Shanghai to the vicinity of the North Station and hired a car to return home. He only felt mentally exhausted.</p>

<p>Lao Jie Fu's Grand Moving Sale</p>
<p>Lao Jie Fu Silk and Satin Store in this city will soon move to its new location at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Henan Road. All the inventory will be sold yesterday at the original location on Er Ma Road in a grand moving sale. Some items are priced at less than one-tenth of the usual price, which is truly the lowest record. The low prices of the new autumn goods are even more unexpected. As a result, the store was extremely crowded with customers today. In this economic downturn, this grand occasion is due to the store's historical reputation and the rare opportunity of the moving sale, which is not comparable to ordinary price reductions.</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<p>To the editor, after reading the news item "Tianchan Teahouse Closed" on page 15 of the fourth edition of your newspaper on September 3, I was shocked to read it, which led to continuous phone calls from all parties inquiring and believing it to be true. Not only has our teahouse not closed, but it has also been greatly renovated recently, and business is booming and improving. I am deeply afraid that the rumors will be spread and mislead our teahouse's business. I hope that your newspaper will publish this statement in the letter column and correct it. This is my sincere prayer. Tianchan Teahouse on Xizang Road, September 3.</p>
<p>To the editor, after reading the news item "Zhang Dengying, General Secretary of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association, Accused of Defamation by the Rickshaw Pullers Council" in your newspaper, since I became a director of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association, because I am loyal to my duties, I have been envied and resented by Dengying, who distributed leaflets everywhere on the 17th of last month that were printed to damage Cang Gongwen's reputation. This is fundamentally inconsistent with the facts. I have to make a statement. The day the leaflets were distributed was when I was on leave at Putuo. I did not discover the origin of the leaflets until after I returned to Shanghai, and it has nothing to do with me. It is only because I have not been understood by Cang Gongwen, so he attacked me and falsely accused me, intending to take over the association's affairs, monopolize everything, and that the accounts are not public. These points are even more fabricated. I cannot remain silent, lest I confuse the public. The organization of the mutual aid association is supervised and urged by the custody committee and the council. How can it be said that I am taking over the association's affairs and monopolizing everything? The expenditure accounts for the 23rd year were published in the Chinese and foreign newspapers long ago. The accounts for the 24th year have been audited by the accountant and are being published. Each year's and each month's expenditures are determined by the council's budget. Even if a penny is spent, it must be strictly reviewed by the accountant and carefully approved by the custody committee before it can be implemented. How can it be said that it is not public? In short, the truth of this case will eventually come to light. I do not want to defend myself. I only want to maintain the credibility of the entire mutual aid association and the prestige of other directors. Therefore, I briefly describe it and ask the editor of your newspaper to uphold the spirit of safeguarding the people's wisdom and promoting it. It would be a public service to publish my letter. This is my sincere gratitude. Zhang Dengying, tobacco industry, September 3, 25.</p>

<p>Zhu Xiongwu and Others Appeal Request to Re-Appraise Handwriting Denied Debate Ended Yesterday, Judgment in Ten Days</p>
<p>Zhu Xiongwu, a dismissed clerk of the Jiangsu High Court, was prosecuted by the Wuxian District Procuratorate for conspiring with Chen Chaozuan, a clerk of the same court, and Lu Wenguang, a lawyer's clerk, to solicit lawsuits and defraud parties of money on eight occasions while in office. The case was filed in the Criminal Court of the Wuxian District Court. Later, at Zhu's request, the Supreme Court transferred the two defendants, Chen and Lu, along with Zhu Xiongwu, to the Shanghai First Special District Court for the convenience of the trial. The first instance trial has ended, and Zhu Xiongwu has been sentenced to two years in prison, Lu Wenguang to one year and six months in prison, and Chen Chaozuan was acquitted. Details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that Zhu and Lu are dissatisfied with the sentence and have submitted reasons, and hired lawyers Li Mo and Ge Zhiqin to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu Hua, accompanied by assessors Xiao and Nie, took the bench in the First Criminal Court for questioning. Witness Li Shannan did not appear. His wife, Li Zhao, stated that her husband, Li Shannan, had been sentenced to one year in prison and fined 1,000 yuan by the Shanghai District Court for the Xu Shanlang fraud case. Because she was friends with Lu Wenguang, she visited Mr. Lu and asked for help in writing an appeal. At that time, Lu comforted her, saying not to be anxious. Her husband, Li Shannan, had been in prison for ten months. If the appeal could reduce the sentence, he could be released. She then stated that if her husband could have his prison time reduced and not be fined, she would be willing to give a reward of 200 national currency. After her husband was released from prison, he was unwilling to pay the promised reward, so he has not paid it to this day. Zhu Xiongwu and Lu Wenguang confessed that they were not convinced by the crimes and sentences imposed in the first instance and requested the High Court to conduct further investigation. They also expressed dissatisfaction with the handwriting appraisal and requested a new appraisal, but the results were not approved. The court then ordered the debate to begin. First, Prosecutor Lin made a statement, saying that the original trial was correct in the sentence imposed on the two appellants, and that the statements made by the two appellants were not sufficient to overturn the first instance judgment. The evidence of the two appellants colluding to defraud money was indeed convincing and should be rejected. Finally, the defense lawyers of the appellants debated for a long time. The court adjourned the case and announced that the judgment would be announced on September 10. The appellants were still remanded to the detention center.</p>
<p>New Family and Hygiene</p>

<h3>Sincere Advice to Lung Disease Patients!</h3>
<p>— Physician Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>Lung disease is a stubborn and difficult disease to cure, not something that can be cured with a day or two of treatment. It requires a long period of separation from society and dedicated recuperation to achieve complete success. Therefore, to conquer lung disease and cure it, patients must have a spirit of great courage and cultivate long-term courage and patience. This is indeed a crucial key to curing lung disease. However, most people who die from lung disease do not die from the disease itself, but from causing themselves unnecessary trouble over a long period, exhausting their minds and bodies, and thus dying.</p>
<p>Lung disease requires a long period of recuperation, so it is inevitable that patients will think about active society and healthy people, cursing the world and envying others, thinking that everyone else is healthy while they alone suffer from lung disease, harboring resentment. Although this is a common feeling of injustice and dissatisfaction among patients, such troublesome dissatisfaction can indeed hinder mental tranquility and promote severe neurasthenia, resulting in sleepless nights, decreased appetite, and various secondary obstacles. This not only makes it difficult for the disease to heal early but also inevitably worsens the condition. Therefore, the first step in treating lung disease is to be optimistic about everything, transcend the environment, and cultivate the mind, which is the most urgent task.</p>
<p>If patients have unyielding patience and steadfast perseverance, engage in self-cultivation, and at the same time further enhance their body's physiological defense functions (i.e., resistance) and unleash their natural healing functions, then the progressive nature of the diseased part can be transformed into a stationary one, the fever will subside, the cough with phlegm will decrease, and naturally, vitality will be vigorous and the spirit will be refreshed. Regarding healing, there can be infinite hope.</p>
<p>People who suffer from tuberculosis are often frightened and worried, trembling as if the end of the world is approaching. In reality, complete cure can be expected if positive treatment is sought at the appropriate time. It is a pity that many patients are ignorant of medical common sense. Initially, they may neglect to notice it, let it go untreated, or use inappropriate medications, going astray, and ultimately becoming incurable, which is truly regrettable. In terms of today's medical advancements, effective treatments for lung disease are available. According to recent reports from various lung disease sanatoriums around the world, the newly developed German drug "Phith Weal" has proven effective in treating tuberculosis (pulmonary tuberculosis) in stages one, two, and three. If patients take it according to the instructions, while also paying attention to hygiene, persevering steadfastly, and engaging in long-term recuperation, the number who recover and regain their health can reach as high as 95 percent.</p>
<p>According to the composition of "Phith Weal," it is made from the endocrine secretions—hormones—extracted from the fresh lungs and spleens of strong and healthy animals, mixed into an oral liquid. Its effect is to revitalize the weakened lung function—turning weakness into strength—promoting its defense capabilities, and making the physiological natural healing functions vigorous. Tissue defects (i.e., where there are cavities in the lungs) can be filled in. At the same time, a solid wall of connective tissue is built around the diseased part, hardening it and promoting the combination of scar tissue, completely enveloping the evil tubercle bacilli (tubercle bacilli), preventing their activity, and ultimately causing them to be completely eliminated, leading to recovery. Therefore, patients taking "Phith Weal" feel refreshed in just a few days, their appetite increases, their phlegm becomes thinner, their cough decreases, and hemoptysis, night sweats, and hot flashes all disappear. It can achieve the hope of complete cure in a very short period of time. Therefore, scholars around the world unanimously recommend "Phith Weal" as the most reasonable and truly effective oral treatment for lung disease.</p>
<h3>The Sorrows of Puberty in Men and Women</h3>
<p>— Li Zhirong</p>
<p>Dysfunction of Reproductive Organs</p>
<p>Tender green leaves, emerging, harbor unknown distress in the hearts of lively youth... They worry day and night; and what troubles the most vigorous youth is probably dysfunction of the reproductive organs!</p>
<p>What is dysfunction of the reproductive organs? In men, it is generally symptoms such as small penis, kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, nocturnal emission, and spermatorrhea. In women, it is abnormal libido, lack of pleasure, pain during intercourse, and also irregular menstruation (abdominal pain before and after menstruation, menstrual periods that are either too early or too late, excessive or insufficient menstrual flow, or even amenorrhea), frequent leukorrhea, and other symptoms. If either husband or wife suffers from diseases of reproductive organ dysfunction, the result will surely destroy the happiness of the family and develop into various tragedies...</p>
<p>People suffering from reproductive organ dysfunction also experience extremely harmful mental distress, agonizing all day long, depressed and unhappy, dispirited, and reduced in strength. This gradually leads to a state of severe neurasthenia; head heaviness, dizziness, headache, insomnia, tinnitus, fatigue, memory loss, mental anxiety, back pain. In short, they become a useless person afflicted with all kinds of diseases! Lacking vitality. Most people suffering from reproductive organ dysfunction are inherently weak and nervous. The main reason is that both men and women have excessively masturbated, thus falling into this unfortunate disease. There are also quite a few cases where this condition arises due to excessive sexual activity, after suffering from venereal disease, or due to excessive physical and mental exertion.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment methods for reproductive organ dysfunction, according to the experience of various specialist physicians, to save male reproductive dysfunction, it is advisable to take the German endocrine preparation "WELL TONIC." For female dysfunction and menstrual irregularities, it is advisable to take "MENORRIN." Both of these drugs have surprising effects in treating reproductive organ dysfunction in both men and women. If they follow their own symptoms and take them for a considerable period, the functional impairment can definitely be eliminated, and they will naturally be able to lead a normal married life.</p>
<p>Neurasthenia! is the demon that destroys our vitality; in treatment, it should be regarded as an important issue equal to reproductive organ dysfunction. Therefore, when treating reproductive organ dysfunction, it is necessary to also use tonic and nerve-strengthening medications. Physicians in various countries recommend "MEMORY NEUROTIC," which has the authority to turn weakness into strength. This medicine is not limited to men or women and can be taken by anyone. Usually, after taking it for two or three weeks, obvious effects appear; the spirit is lively, vitality is doubled, the mind is clear, the mind is refreshed, thoughts are sharp, appetite is increased, and the overall state of health naturally recovers.</p>
<h3>The Question of Curing Asthma</h3>
<p>— DR. W.R. CHIYLON M. D., translated by Physician Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>Asthma, also known as phlegm asthma, has been difficult to treat since ancient times. The onset of this disease often begins in childhood. In its early stages, it is easily affected by wind and cold, often developing rhinitis and chronic tracheobronchitis, with symptoms such as snoring, whistling, and difficulty breathing. Over time, it develops into fixed asthma. Such children are often thin and tall, and their chest development is not very good. However, often by the time they reach full development, around the age of twenty, the chronic asthma disappears as if lost. If it does not heal after this age, it will remain incurable for the rest of their lives. There are also cases where it appears in old age. People in their forties or fifties develop asthma and suffer from it for the rest of their lives. This type of case is also common. The symptoms of asthma are mainly characterized by severe difficulty breathing. The onset is usually sudden at night. Breathing is obstructed, making it impossible to lie down, so they sit or stand to ease their breathing. Their complexion is pale or bluish-purple. The frequency of attacks varies, and the duration also varies. Some have several attacks a week, while others have one or two attacks in one or two years. Some recover after one or two hours, while others recover after one night or several days. Some even suffer from breathing difficulties for several weeks. Most asthma patients suffer from poor physical strength and find work quite distressing. If a way to cure it is not found, they will suffer for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>In the past, asthma treatment was considered extremely difficult because there were no perfect medications. Even clinical physicians felt helpless with this condition, often only using anesthetics (morphine, opium, etc.) to temporarily relieve the pain during attacks. However, these anesthetics should not be used frequently, as there is a risk of addiction. Most of the asthma medications sold in the market contain anesthetics. Although they can take effect immediately, they have the disadvantage of being addictive. It is even more dangerous for patients to use these medications at home for self-treatment.</p>
<p>Now, there is the latest German invention, "Holipin," an oral medicine with a special effect on curing asthma. According to the results of experiments by physicians in various countries, it has the potential to cure various types of asthma in children and the elderly. If used during an attack, it is only necessary to swallow two to three tablets, and generally, the asthma will be relieved in ten minutes. Afterwards, if continued to be taken during the remission period, from half a dozen to a dozen tablets, it will definitely relieve the suffering of recurrence. Moreover, "Holipin" has a peaceful medicinal nature, and its ingredients do not contain any anesthetics, so it is suitable for long-term use without causing any adverse effects. Therefore, physicians in various countries recognize this product as a safe oral medicine for curing asthma.</p>

<h3>Red and White Dysentery</h3>
<p>— Physician Yu Qixi</p>
<p>—Symptoms and Treatment—</p>

<h3>The Period of Spring Awakening in Women</h3>
<p>— Female Physician Chen Xingfen</p>
<p>Diseases that are Easily Triggered</p>
<p>...Attention Should be Paid to Treatment...</p>
<p>During the period of spring awakening in women, there is a major change in their body and mind. Various diseases are easily triggered.

<p>The symptoms of chlorosis are emaciation, pale complexion, no blood, dull spirit, decreased appetite, amenorrhea, limb weakness, tinnitus, and blurred vision.

<h3>Misconceptions About Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Compiled by the Citizen Sanatorium at the Intersection of Haining Road and Keneng Road, Shanghai</p>
<p>The Chronic Gonorrhea's</p>
<p>—Secret to Radical Cure—</p>
<p>If someone has contracted gonorrhea, they should pay attention to hygiene and carry out regular treatment when it is in the acute stage. Do not let it turn into chronic. If it has already become chronic, you must pay more attention to health maintenance and actively treat it. You must always know that to eradicate weeds, you must pull them up by the roots. The same goes for treating gonorrhea. You need to do this so there are no future troubles. To eradicate gonorrhea, you should pay attention to the following health maintenance and treatments.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Health Maintenance</p>
<p>(1) You should rest quietly and avoid various sports. For example, dancing, horseback riding, cycling, swimming, long-distance travel, etc. are all things to avoid. (2) Pay attention to your diet. You should avoid wine, soda, fragrant and spicy, and other irritating foods. If you eat them, it can often make the gonorrhea worse. It is advisable to eat milk, porridge, tea, and wheat, etc. Drinking more boiled water is beneficial. (3) Prohibit intercourse. Whether you have acute or chronic gonorrhea, you cannot have sex. If you have sex, not only is there a risk of infecting your wife, but the gonorrhea that was getting better will suddenly become worse again. There is also the pain of developing orchitis. So you should try your best to restrain your desires. (4) Bowel movements should be smooth every day because constipation also easily makes gonorrhea worse.</p>
<p>Regular Treatment</p>
<p>How can gonorrhea be cured radically? This is something that patients really long for. However, there are so many kinds of medications for gonorrhea sold on the market that it is really confusing. However, among those gonorrhea medicines, very few really have therapeutic effects. Although they are described in flowery language, most of them are not what they claim to be. Inferior medicines deceive people. So choosing a medicine is also a very difficult problem for patients to solve. Therefore, whether gonorrhea can be cured radically depends on whether the medicine you use is appropriate as the standard.</p>
<p>Currently, among the oral medications for treating gonorrhea, according to patient testimonials and doctor reports, the most reliable effect is "918" Anti-Gono-Tab. The method of preparation and the synthetic formula of this medicine are completely different from other medicines.</p>
<p>It has the powerful function of penetrating membranes and killing bacteria. But it is absolutely harmless to the human body. After taking it, it is absorbed into the mucous membrane of the intestine and then turns into powerful bactericidal urine in the bladder. The gonococci are killed and excreted. So it does not harm the stomach and kidneys. And it takes effect quite quickly. Whether the patient has acute or chronic gonorrhea, if they receive this regular treatment and health maintenance, after a considerable period of time, they can definitely achieve the hope of radical cure. Therefore, "918 Anti-Gono-Tab" has been praised by the international medical community and is unanimously recognized as an effective oral medicine for treating gonorrhea.</p>
<h3>The Crisis of Youth: Nocturnal Emission!</h3>
<p>— Physician Zhang Yuanzhen</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission is mostly caused by erotic dreams. It is easy to commit if one is a youth whose spring passion is stirring and who has difficulty having contact with women, or if one's blood and qi are strong but one has not yet married, or if one is in another place and cannot sleep with one's wife. Others are caused by excessive masturbation or excessive sexual activity. Especially young people often have lewd thoughts and masturbate recklessly, resulting in this disease. The result is mental decline, dizziness, tinnitus, headache, insomnia, sore back, limb weakness, and a gaunt, lifeless appearance. If not treated early or treated improperly, it will eventually lead to weakness, consumption, and death.</p>
<p>The treatment for nocturnal emission requires restraining sexual desire, abstaining from stimulating foods and drinks, and avoiding excessive physical and mental labor. For medicines to stop nocturnal emission, it is advisable to take "Folan Tab" orally two to three tablets before going to bed at night. It is quite effective. Most people can recover completely after taking only one or two bottles. For the various weakness symptoms caused by kidney deficiency, a strong tonic should be used. "Well Tonic" has the authority to prevent aging and save weakness.</p>

<h3>A Correspondent's Account of Our National Team's Participation in the Games (Letter No. 11) - Special Correspondent Feng Youzhen from the Central News Agency</h3>
<p>Javelin Results Lack Distinction</p>
<p>The javelin qualifying round was held at 10:30 AM, with a requirement of 60 meters to qualify for the afternoon's preliminary and final rounds. Thirty-five athletes participated, but only nine qualified. Our nation's only participant, Hao Chunde, had a strength far below 60 meters and was naturally eliminated. The preliminary round began at 3:15 PM. The top six results were as follows:</p>
<p>Nikanen (Finland) 70.64 meters</p>
<p>Attewall (Sweden) 69.20 meters</p>
<p>Järvinen (Finland) 69.18 meters</p>
<p>Toivonen (Finland) 68.17 meters</p>
<p>Stöck (Germany) 68.11 meters</p>
<p>Tilley (USA) 67.15 meters</p>
<p>Järvinen of Finland, the world record holder (77.66 meters, set in 1934) and the Olympic record holder (72.72 meters, set in 1923), failed to exceed 70 meters in three throws, which was quite disappointing and greatly surprised the audience. In the final three throws, Järvinen not only failed to improve but was surpassed by others, finishing fifth, the same fate as Torrance in the shot put, Schlott in the discus, and Glehre in the pole vault. This can be called a miracle of this Games (Note: All four of the above were world record holders, and all finished fifth in this Games). Among the other five athletes, Nikanen, Toivonen, and Stöck all improved, and Stöck's ability to win the top spot was quite unexpected. However, the results were far from the world record and less than one meter short of the Olympic record.</p>
<p>(1) Stöck (Germany) 71.84</p>
<p>(2) Nikanen (Finland) 70.77</p>
<p>(3) Toivonen (Finland) 70.72</p>
<p>(4) Attewall (Sweden) 69.20</p>
<p>(5) Järvinen (Finland) 69.18</p>
<p>(6) Tilley (USA) 67.15</p>
<p>High Hurdles Semi-Finals and Final</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM, the high hurdles semi-finals were divided into two groups. In the first group, the American athlete Towns displayed unmatched grace and speed in his hurdling technique. His front foot lightly brushed the hurdle on takeoff, and he landed in a straight line without delay, leading the entire way. He finished four meters ahead of second place with a time of 14.1 seconds, breaking the world record of 14.2 seconds set by the American athlete Beard in 1934 and the Olympic record of 14.4 seconds set by the American athlete Saling in 1932. The British athlete Thornton finished half a meter behind the Swedish athlete Lidman, taking third place and becoming the first British athlete to reach the finals in track events. In the second group, the British athlete Finley and the American athlete Borath competed fiercely. Finley won by a shoulder's length due to a swift final sprint. The Canadian athlete O'Connor finished three meters behind, taking third place. The results were: First place, Towns (USA) 14.1 seconds, new world record; Second place, Lidman (Sweden) 14.5 seconds; Third place, Thornton (England) 14.7 seconds; Fourth place, Steile (USA) and below were eliminated; Fifth place, Murakami Tadashi (Japan); Sixth place, Lavelles (Argentina). In the second group, First place, Finley (England) 14.5 seconds; Second place, Borath (USA) 14.6 seconds; Third place, O'Connor (Canada) 15.0 seconds; Fourth place, Ivanivic (Czechoslovakia) and below were eliminated; Fifth place, Wegner (Germany); Sixth place, Ravelley (South Africa). The final was held at 5:15 PM. Towns' secure grasp of the championship was expected. The second place was fiercely contested by Finley, Borath, and Lidman. After the starting gun, Towns took the lead with a swift start at the second hurdle. Finley and Borath closely followed, competing fiercely. However, Towns ran faster and faster, finishing over a meter ahead with a time of 14.2 seconds, equaling the world record, although slightly slower than his semi-final time. Finley and Borath finished at the same time, with a very small difference. Both of their times equaled the Olympic record. The fourth place and below were more than a foot behind.</p>
<p>(1) Towns (USA) 14.2 seconds</p>
<p>(2) Finley (England) 14.4 seconds</p>
<p>(3) Borath (USA) 14.4 seconds</p>
<p>(4) Lidman (Sweden)</p>
<p>(5) Thornton (England)</p>
<p>(6) O'Connor (Canada)</p>
<p>1500 Meter Final</p>
<p>The twelve heroes participating in the 1500-meter final were all renowned athletes from various countries. Among them, the American middle-distance running master Cunningham, the New Zealand star Lovelock, the Canadian black athlete Edwards, and the defending champion, the Italian athlete Beccali, were the most notable. Although Lovelock finished third in the preliminary round, observers knew that his strength and light strides made him Cunningham's greatest rival. After the start, the twelve athletes were in a chaotic battle, constantly close to each other. After three laps, Lovelock broke free from the crowd, running like a raging horse. Although Cunningham tried his best to catch up, he lacked the strength and fell behind by three or four meters. Both Lovelock and Cunningham broke the world record (3 minutes 48.8 seconds, set by the American Ponstullon in 1934). The top five results all broke the Olympic record (3 minutes 51.2 seconds, set by the Italian Beccali in 1932), which was truly remarkable. Lovelock's time, shortened by one second, was particularly valuable. First place, Lovelock (New Zealand) 3 minutes 47.4 seconds, new world record; Second place, Cunningham (USA) 3 minutes 48.4 seconds, new world record; Third place, Beccali (Italy) 3 minutes 49.2 seconds, new Olympic record; Fourth place, San Romani (USA) 3 minutes 50.0 seconds, new Olympic record; Fifth place, Edwards (Canada) 3 minutes 50.4 seconds, new Olympic record; Sixth place, Cornes (England) 3 minutes 51.4 seconds.</p>
<p>Women's Hurdles Final</p>
<p>After the preliminary and semi-final rounds of the women's 80-meter low hurdles, all the remaining athletes were top-notch. Before the final, no one could predict who would win. At the start, the six athletes were equally matched, clearing the first two hurdles together. After the third hurdle, Mrs. Van der and Mrs. Taylor competed fiercely, as in the semi-finals. Mrs. Steward also tried her best to catch up. At the last hurdle, the three athletes sprinted with all their might, separated by only a hair's breadth, determining the final standings. The results were all 11.7 seconds, equaling the Olympic record, slightly slower than the semi-final results. Mrs. Deszeni was half a step behind in fourth place, and the fifth and sixth-place athletes were also less than a meter behind, showing the fierce competition. First place, Van der (Italy), 11.7 seconds, equals Olympic record; Second place, Steward (Germany), 11.7 seconds; Third place, Taylor (Canada), 11.7 seconds; Fourth place, Deszeni (Italy); Fifth place, Brackett (Netherlands); Sixth place, Eckert (Germany).</p>

Although the competition time was set at 8:30 PM, the entrance was already crowded with spectators from 7:00 PM.

<h3>Jiangsu Province to Alleviate Competition for Elementary School Entrance Exams; Department of Education Considers Lifting Restrictions on Establishing Junior High Schools and Adding Grades</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education believes that in recent years, when middle schools recruit students, the number of applicants often exceeds the number of admitted students by more than tenfold. County-run and private middle schools are also in short supply. As a result, elementary schools compete in exams to show their academic excellence, which has a great impact on the physical and mental development of children. Often, their studies are not completed, and their bodies are already destroyed. On the middle school side, due to the large number of applicants, it is difficult to select students. They have to raise the admission standards as much as possible, and the difficulty of the questions exceeds the elementary school curriculum standards. Even if the exam score is above 60 points, they are often not admitted. As a result, the middle and elementary school curriculums never connect, and there are so-called cram schools between middle and elementary schools, which virtually extend middle and elementary school education by one or two years. Furthermore, because education is meant to support people's livelihoods, vocational education is certainly an essential plan. However, given the current backwardness of the country's production industries, how can there be a way out? Therefore, even with the excellent facilities and generous treatment of outstanding students in provincial vocational schools, students still hesitate to apply. What about county-run and private schools? Therefore, on the one hand, it reduces the opportunity for elementary school students to enter higher schools, and on the other hand, it wastes the country's public funds. Therefore, the Department of Education believes that although the laws have restrictions, it has to be slightly modified. Therefore, at the Department of Education's meeting held a few days ago, it specifically proposed to consider lifting the restrictions on establishing junior high schools and adding grades to meet social needs. The resolution in principle has been passed, and it is expected to be implemented soon.</p>
<h3>National Scout Review; Organizational Design Committee</h3>
<p>The organizing committee of the Second National Review and Jamboree of the China Boy Scouts, in order to plan the conference in detail, specially hired experts to form an organizational design committee.

It is learned that since the association started working on August 23, it has completed all the important designs of the conference and handed them over to the organizing committee for transfer to various groups for reference and implementation. It is heard that the association's planning of various matters is quite precise and detailed, which is very helpful to the progress of the conference.</p>
<p>Director Yan has decided to return to Wuhan on the 5th and come back at the end of this month to participate in the National Review.</p>
<h3>Ten Groups in This City Sent Off Wang Longzhang Yesterday; Chairmen Pan Gongzhan and Wang Xiaolai Gave Farewell Speeches</h3>

<h3>Social Recession; Sharp Decline in the Number of Students in Private Schools</h3>
<p>All schools in this city, large, medium, and small, have started classes one after another. According to the Shanghai News Agency's investigation from various sources, except for public schools, where students are still crowded, the number of students in private schools has decreased sharply this semester, with some even decreasing by more than one-third. This is especially true for middle schools. This is also due to the social recession and the fact that general families cannot afford the education expenses of their children.</p>

<h3>Yuanfang Piece Goods Sales Stagnant in the North</h3>
<p>Last week, on Thursday, Yuanfang held its 3005th auction, displaying four types of goods across thirty-nine brands, totaling sixty-two cases. Trade with northern merchants was sluggish, making it difficult to increase the number of cases. Bidding prices trended downward. Prices for Western satins, across six brands, remained similar to the previous period. Prices for Yuan velvet and tribute cloth, seven cases in total, held steady. Yuan silk fabrics, forty-nine cases, saw ten more cases included compared to the previous period, but most auction prices were lower. "Deng Gao," "Dong Hua," "Monkey, Deer, Butterfly, Immortal Nine-Linked Lantern," "Mid-Autumn," "Bo Zi An," and "Dian Bao" (eight brands) each fell by five or six jiao. Only "Luan Feng" and "Er Mei" (two brands) rose by three or four jiao. The rest were flat or weak.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: User Sales of Silk Still Strong; Possible Bumper Autumn Cocoon Harvest; Silk Prices May Not Decline Excessively</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in Shanghai saw excellent sales to users. Unfortunately, overseas silk prices fell again (New York’s average price for silk grades 83 and 75 fell by three fen; Shanghai silk grade 78 fell by one fen; Guangdong silk fell by two fen; Yokohama spot prices fell by 10 yuan; futures held steady; New York standard silk spot and futures prices both fell by one fen). This prevented foreign firms from achieving brisk sales; only Da Chang Da Feng and other firms shipped 111 bales. In addition, users completed transactions for a total of 173 bales. It is now understood that the silk market anticipates a potential continued weakening of silk prices due to the bumper autumn cocoon harvest. However, it is rumored that the raw cocoon purchase price might be set at 30 yuan per dan, which would calculate the cost of silk to be around 600 yuan per dan. Therefore, even if silk prices decline slightly, it appears there will not be a huge disparity. Shandong yellow and white spun silk and Sichuan spun silk, due to falling white factory prices leading to brisk sales, have experienced extremely sluggish sales recently, with very few transactions.</p>
<p>Appendix: August New York Raw Silk Inventory Report</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to Reuters, the New York raw silk inventory report showed a sharp increase in raw silk imports in August. Japanese silk increased by 12,061 bales compared to the previous month, Chinese silk increased by only 50 bales, and European silk decreased by 1,092 bales. Total New York sales increased by 5,358 bales compared to the previous month. The inventory sales situation in August and the status of raw silk from various countries in the U.S. are listed below:</p>
<p>Import       Sales        Inventory</p>
<p>Japanese Silk       40,487         39,828          25,754</p>
<p>European Silk        1,059          565</p>
<p>Russian Silk         -            -            -</p>
<p>Guangdong Silk        -             8          1,585</p>
<p>Shanghai Silk        1,205          1,581          1,931</p>
<p>Total            41,702         42,026          29,825</p>
<p>Qimen Black Tea Sales Active in England; Green Tea Transactions Very Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday, Qimen black tea from British firms such as Xiehe Jinlong saw decent buying interest due to favorable prices. Other merchants also sent many telegrams. Based on the current situation, the market may continue to see activity. Ningzhou black tea inventories are exhausted, but some of the later shipments of flower grades are still arriving. Green tea sales remained sluggish yesterday. Dealers in both local and foreign firms were awaiting responses to telegrams sent regarding "Zhen Mei." Only "Zhen Mei" and "Zhu Cha" saw slight restocking by Tongfu, Xiehe, Yongxing, and other firms. Prices remained stable.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Tea Warehouses Association, green tea inventories are not high due to previous brisk sales, and the quality is slightly lower than before, resulting in very quiet transactions. Yesterday, Xiehe continued to import over 500 boxes of Suian "Zhen Mei" at 52 yuan, and imported over 100 boxes of small "Zhen Mei" at the same price as before. Jinlong also slightly imported small "Zhen Mei." Tongfu and Fushi had discussions about "Zhen Mei," but no transactions occurred. Yihua completed transactions for over 600 boxes of tea from Hunan and Hubei.</p>
<p>Grains: Flour Market Driven Up by Wind and Rain; Afternoon Market Suddenly Rises: Jumping Up Three Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the prices for each month initially remained calm, then resumed the pattern of horizontal jumping. The quoted prices for foreign wheat from Chicago and Canada fell by about one or two jiao. Therefore, at the opening, the price for the current month was 3.14 yuan, up one and a half fen from the previous day. Trading was smooth for both near and distant futures. Factories continued to hedge, so there was no favorable outlook. As a result, after the second round of trading, prices for each month fell by one or two fen. After the third round, due to renewed strong buying interest, opening prices rebounded. When the market opened in the afternoon, the atmosphere suddenly turned brisk, largely due to significant windstorms. Insiders and outsiders alike could not help but consider taking action. Near-term futures saw minimal rebound due to sluggish real sales, while distant futures rose by two, three, or four fen. Observing subsequent steps, if the weather improves and real demand remains sluggish, it is feared that the market will not remain brisk.</p>
<p>Wheat: Morning Decline, Afternoon Rise; Resulting in Only One Fen Difference</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw prices for each month generally flat at the morning opening. Due to foreign wheat price quotations being slightly lower by one or two jiao, opening prices initially remained unchanged. Later, as dealers hedged by selling near-term futures, prices gradually weakened, reaching a low of 4.86 yuan at closing. Distant futures also declined slightly by two or three fen. When the market opened in the afternoon, due to significant windstorms, the flour market had already been stimulated, so the initial trading was flat, followed by a rise. Fortunately, dealers hedged, so the rise was not too severe. As a result, the difference compared to the previous day was only one fen. The wheat market remains stable. Factories are still eager to buy, offering 4.94 yuan for Wuhe wheat, 4.945 yuan for Yingzhou wheat, 4.90 yuan for Mingguang wheat, 4.72 yuan for Hankou cart wheat (4.77 yuan for secondary), 4.60 yuan for Wuhu wheat, 4.85 yuan for Huaian wheat (4.883 yuan for premium), 4.85 yuan for Yaowan and Suqian wheat (4.88 yuan for secondary), 4.75 yuan for Jiangbei wheat, 4.93 yuan for Suzhou wheat, 4.445 yuan for Chongming wheat, 4.81 yuan for Bengbu wheat (4.76 yuan for secondary). Fufeng purchased 5,000 bags, Fuxin purchased 6,000 bags, and Shenda purchased 2,000 bags.</p>
<p>Foreign Firms Continue to Trade Sesame Seeds; Japanese Buy Over 40,000 Pieces of Bean Cakes; Soybean Market Able to Recover from Decline</p>
<p>Foreign firms are dumping new sesame seeds, and market prices continue to fall. Due to the recent increase in sellers, Daufu Foreign Firm remains the only buyer, so market sentiment is not likely to improve in the short term. Yesterday's market saw brisk trading, but prices remained weak, opening at 12.275 yuan and falling to 12.20 yuan, with a total of 800 tons traded for delivery in October, November, and December. Currently, selling pressure does not appear strong, and the future trend may stabilize. New Yangzhou soybeans have also entered the market, with inconsistent quality, opening for over 200 bags at prices of 5.20 yuan and 4.80 yuan. In addition, Changzhou Niupi Huang opened for over 1,600 bags, purchased by local and oil pressing factories. Shantou merchants purchased 79 bags of Hankou early soybeans, and domestic buyers and local merchants purchased over 1,200 bags of various Jiujiang soybeans. The market trend might stabilize after bean cake sales suddenly increased in the afternoon (with Japanese merchants buying over 40,000 pieces of various cakes), and it would not be surprising if prices stabilize.</p>
<p>Guangdong Merchants Continue to Buy Briskly; Ke Xian Rice Rebounds Quickly</p>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian rice arrivals remained brisk, with batches arriving from various Yangtze River routes. Market inventories are ample, and sources continue to arrive, so merchants and owners are still eager to sell. After the morning opening, prices were lowered by merchants from various groups seeking sales, and the market appeared to be rapidly trending downward. Subsequently, local buyers suddenly showed strong interest. Importers, fearing damage to the autumn harvest due to unfavorable weather, showed strong buying interest. In addition to brisk local sales, domestic buyers also inquired, and Guangdong merchants were even more eager to buy. In addition to continuing to purchase brown rice, Guangdong merchants also expressed strong interest in machine-milled Jing and early rice. As a result, prices for various grades immediately reversed, rebounding by five or six fen to nearly one jiao compared to the previous market. A total of 2,760 bags of Gan rice, 4,600 bags of Xiang rice, 7,000 bags of Hankou brown rice, 300 bags of Shasha rice, 150 bags of Taiwanese rice, and 320 bags of Beijing brown rice were sold throughout the day.</p>
<p>White Jing Rice Sales Unaffected by Wind and Rain</p>
<p>(Jinan) Yesterday, supplies arrived from various groups, totaling 2,500 to 2,600 shi across 13 or 14 shipments. Local sales remained flat, with no movement in bag purchases. However, due to sudden changes in the weather with windstorms and rain, sentiment slightly stabilized, and higher-quality thick and thin Jing rice appeared to be firming. However, mid-grade rice remained only flat.</p>
<p>Foreign grade and inferior "Qian Yuan" rice saw no change. Arrivals of Dongxin Jing rice decreased, with only 400 to 500 shi arriving. The new crop market is inherently dependent on weather conditions, so prices rose by one chi with the windstorms, and new crop rice also appeared to be benefiting.</p>
<p>(Northern Shanghai) Yesterday, 17 or 18 shipments of various goods arrived from He Xia. Despite the continuous wind and rain, local sales of white Jing rice, new Ke grain, and sharp-grained rice were brisk, leading to lively trading. The remaining goods saw some transactions. Market prices for white Jing rice, Yang Du Bu Ke grain, and new sharp-grained Ke rice stabilized. Thin rice held firm, and "Bian Yuan" rose by three to five fen. Dongxin Jing rice rose by one jiao. Arrivals of new Tuan Xian and new Yang sharp-grained rice continued to be absorbed, and prices fluctuated.</p>

<p>Securities: Bond Market Fails to Break Dullness</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange remained very stable. Trading by various groups was very quiet, awaiting progress in the environment. Throughout the day, the market remained in a state of broad consolidation, and it seemed unlikely to break the dullness in the short term. At the morning opening, market prices fluctuated up and down by about five fen to one jiao. No. 35 saw some activity. The second round of trading still saw mixed gains and losses, with a few unchanged and most showing mixed ups and downs. The afternoon trading still lacked vitality, either up by five fen to one jiao, or down by a small one jiao, or completely unchanged. Closing transactions were low, with most completely unchanged and a few slightly down by five fen. However, No. 96 had already risen by two jiao, and a reversal was inevitable soon. The total number of transactions was 2,505,000 yuan, including an estimated 855,000 yuan for No. 96. The results of the price changes are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<p>North-South Goods: Black Melon Seed Market Prices Tighten</p>
<p>Yesterday evening's telegram reported that the production price in Xuzhou rose again by five or six jiao.</p>
<p>Recently, due to brisk sales by various groups, black melon seed merchants held firm and released few goods. In addition, production prices tightened, so the market has repeatedly shown upward movement, with exceptional tightness. Yesterday, Xukui seeds opened at 16.20 yuan, Dangshan seeds at the same price, Tizhuang seeds at 17.50 yuan, and Mingguang seeds at 13 yuan, all up by varying amounts of four to five jiao. Secondary grades were slightly lower. In addition, last night's telegram from Xuzhou reported that production prices rose again by five or six jiao, and inventories were short, suggesting continued price increases.</p>
<p>Seafood: Sea Cucumber and Jian Dried Clams See Uniform Price Increases</p>
<p>(Sea Cucumber) There is not much old stock remaining in the market, and the supply of new goods is scarce. Sellers are tightening their positions daily.

<p>Denrong Pagat Wandering, Ling Mo</p>
<p>The first place I set foot in Singapore was Tanjong Pagar. But my first visit to Tanjong Pagar was such an unexpected and hurried one. All the difficulties I had worried about on the ship, such as moving luggage, inspection troubles, unfamiliar routes, etc., were easily resolved by the detention by the water police, which I had never worried about. This time, I did not set foot on an inch of Tanjong Pagar, except for a part of Pier 22. Later I learned that Pier 22 was just the edge of Tanjong Pagar.</p>
<p>The next time I went there was half a year later, accompanying people to send friends back to China, and then to send people to the Dutch East Indies, to Europe. I gradually became familiar with this pier. Perhaps because I didn’t have deep friendship with most of the people I sent, or perhaps because the convenience of transportation in modern times has made partings and gatherings extremely common. I didn’t feel any melancholy at this pier, but instead I saw the basic activities of the city here. The twenty-two piers can accommodate more than ten ships of 10,000 tons or more, and sometimes they are crowded with ships of all sizes. On the shore, the pier area is also crowded with people, from God's chosen people to the rest of humanity, all gathered together at once. The bustling scene is almost like two worlds compared to the surroundings. Behind it, sparse oil pools stand on the open space; the dedicated pier on the right side of the strait shows desolation; the silent barren mountains stand opposite; and on the left is a narrow and long shallow bay, with a broken ship stranded at the mouth of the bay, and a row of primitive Malay houses halfway above the water on the east side of the bay. I don't know what kind of feelings the residents living a simple life in those houses have when they face the threat of modern civilization nearby.</p>
<p>Because I went to a place along the Strait of Malacca, I had three or five times experienced the entire journey of Tanjong Pagar and Keppel Harbour. West of the large middle section, there are occasionally piers on both sides. The narrowest part of the strait is only a few feet apart, and tens of thousands of tons of giant ships from the world and Eurasia can pass through here, which can be said to be a natural good port. Earlier, the Portuguese tried their best to seize the port of Malacca. If the British hadn't worked so hard to discover this new port, they might not have discovered this new port so hard. Unexpectedly, an accidental discovery gradually formed an important town on the east-west transportation route, making Malacca's status plummet. Is this the British having admirable vision, or just an opportunity?</p>
<p>The piers in the strait should be better located than Tanjong Pagar, but they are too far from the city. Tanjong Pagar is close to the southwest of the city. The city area on both sides of the Singapore River is indeed more flat than the coast. The places where Tanjong Pagar and the piers to the west were built were only reclaimed from mountains and seas, and there are still many small hills that have not been leveled, so there is no passage between the piers on the shore. Some people say that these remaining hills are deliberately left for military purposes. This statement may be credible. This strait is easy to prevent the invasion of competitors from the west. However, the outer harbor on the east side is extremely open. Building the Singapore military port in the northeast of the island, the aforementioned situation may also be one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Behind the pier is a long, flat road leading to the west of the island. I have only walked to Panjang, and the road runs along the coast at a considerable distance. I don’t know what happens further west. I have only been to Panjang a few times. Usually, I only walk from the east end of Tanjong Pagar to near the gate of P&amp;O (British Mail Ship Company) and turn back. At this time, I happened to move to the vicinity of Tanjong Pagar, so this road became my place to wander. Saying "wandering" seems too poetic. In fact, this road is quite different from what I used to know. It is quite poetic and worth wandering by poets. However, I don't want to pretend to be a poet. I use these two words only to represent what the local compatriots often say, which is equivalent to a Teochew word for "taking a walk." I am usually used to hearing these two words, and I always feel that it is more meaningful than saying "taking a walk."</p>
<p>Probably the origin of the word "wandering" is just to describe the sound of wooden clogs hitting the road. Since we no longer wear wooden clogs, we can no longer appreciate the meaning of this word, so this word has also disappeared from our mouths, while the southerners still continue to use wooden clogs, so they still use it as colloquial language. They wear wooden clogs all day long, and they regard walking in wooden clogs as normal. However, even in the south, we still wear wooden clogs too rarely. Only when the body is completely unrestrained by all kinds of chores, will we casually drag on wooden clogs, and occasionally walk out of the house at will, and then casually walk further away. In this way, every sound of wandering is accompanied by a clear state of mind, and naturally, it will be felt that wandering is a kind of pleasure. Once in the deep quiet night, I wandered into the silent and deserted botanical garden with a close friend. Neither of us made a sound, only listening to the sound of clogs under our feet. At that time, there was a feeling that everything was whole and harmonious and stable. Unexpectedly, such a feeling can actually be occasionally appreciated in Tanjong Pagar, where I have only seen its activities.</p>
<p>When the pier is lively, my wandering is only on the road outside. When the pier is deserted, even the mata at the gate are so idle that they talk to passers-by, I also wander to the pier from time to time. Sometimes there is simply no ship, and sometimes even if there are one or two ships, all the people on the ship have left except for one or two watchmen. The lonely watchmen welcome you to tour the ship. They greet you and talk to you enthusiastically. Although they find that we cannot understand their language, they regard us as more interesting objects and try to communicate by changing Cantonese, Amoy, Hainanese, Malay, and English. A few simple words such as The That IlnMata can also help a lot. With their guidance, I learned about some sea creatures. Once, I was very happy to learn about jellyfish. Its shape is very much like a little man wearing a round hat and wearing a skirt, or it may really be the shadow of a water nymph in Greek mythology.</p>
<p>Thinking of the story of the Golden Apple, didn’t Hercules encounter water nymphs and want to keep him playing with them? They are really too lonely at the ends of the earth. The drifting of jellyfish in front of a prosperous commercial port also reflects a sense of loneliness. In loneliness, many reveries can grow, thinking of the traces left in various places in the past, thinking of the things I have come into contact with, thinking of the people I have met, and even thinking of some people who I sent away at Tanjong Pagar who I am not very familiar with. After all, after they left, I had the opportunity to come to this place of parting and have some irrelevant memories. As for me, I am just wandering alone. This wandering makes me very familiar with the pier. I will naturally miss it in the future, but it will never miss me. Later, I will finally leave a person in Tanjong Pagar who I will miss. I never thought of this at this time.</p>
<p>Hurriedly, it was a few months again. The frost of the motherland finally lured him, who was trapped in the heat, back. The ship scheduled to leave at six o'clock had not left at eight o'clock. I asked the people on the ship and learned that it would not leave before twelve o'clock, so I went to the pier again for the last walk. The people who sent off the guests had already left. There were only a few scattered lights on the pier, and one or two figures were swaying in the distance. The figure was walking towards me. I don’t know why I wanted to turn a corner. The person on that side called me to stop, and I realized that they were here to see me off. They had already come during the day, and I had said goodbye to them like ordinary people who were leaving. A parting was originally very free and easy, but they came again. Did Tanjong Pagar really want to make me taste a little more of parting? In the past few months, they had already been people who had wandered with me, and this time it was just to complete the last, last wandering. However, although everyone was still walking silently this time, everyone's mood was inevitably a little different. Finally, one of the three of us with the most fragile emotions could not bear it, so we could only change a place to walk. Late at night, I managed to send them home, and on the way back to the ship alone, my heart was in a mess. I couldn’t sleep when I returned to the ship, and the ship was delayed until early in the morning. At four o’clock, I had to go ashore again for a walk. Halfway, I met the people who came to see me off last night. They didn’t necessarily expect that the ship hadn’t left yet, but wanted to know sooner that I had indeed left, so they came to where my ship was docked to wander. Alas, this wandering, I think there will be countless times after I leave, I can't help but miss it every time I see the name of Tanjong Pagar.</p>
<p>Summer, Cow, Comparison, TK Leave, Xiangshan</p>
<p>Rain, pushing open the green gauze window in front: the lush old trees in the botanical garden are shrouded in misty smoke, and the glass windows of the greenhouse are bursting with jade-like raindrops.</p>
<p>Every tree and every grass, especially the most impoverished and ripe scenery, can give birth to an unspeakable emotion between the shifts of one's own emotions: this morning, for this familiar rain scene in the botanical garden, there is a sense of loneliness that is even more silent than silence.</p>
<p>I turned back to look at the dark room, and saw a collection of Westbound Songs stuffed in a pile of miscellaneous papers under the table. The peeling gold paper surface revealed a rich, warm breath in this dim room.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm of the Westbound Master for travel aroused his own travel sorrow today. Encountering this depressing summer rain again, from the vast summer air, there was a kind of oily love, pouring over. This is a comprehensive emotion, mixed with many personal thoughts felt in a foreign country.</p>
<p>Until the afternoon, the rain was still pouring down. In the small alley behind the window, there were girls with frowning eyebrows holding oiled paper umbrellas coming and going. At this time, three friends who came to see me off were sitting in my room, silently watching the rain scene outside the window; when silence reaches a considerable depth, it can turn into a transcendent sense of terror; for these friends who will leave, at this time, rather than feeling the pain of separation, it is better to say that they feel the terror of separation; because in occasional situations, on short journeys, they may become strangers, or even things that will never be seen again.</p>
<p>In the evening, the rain cleared, and we all smiled unexpectedly; just as we were about to leave, Jingzhi came back - Jingzhi took a leave of absence specifically to see me off; this small action filled and enriched his empty heart. When I hired a car, thinking that she could send me to Tokyo Station, she shyly refused to go, and sent me to the car with a smile; as the car ran through the wet streets, I felt an unspeakable regret - Jingzhi could not see me off, but at the same time I absorbed the shy emotion of this girl. In her shy and affectionate emotion, I felt happiness and the interruption of a lyric poem.</p>
<p>The Wanderer of the West River, Fei Er</p>
<p>In the West River of Guangdong, the ship will never stop selling plasters along the way, soliciting fortune-telling, doing push-ups, or requesting alms in the "advertising concert," except when you are fast asleep late at night.</p>
<p>So the story that attracted people to listen to was drawn out of the mind, and the expression that attracted people's attention was put out of the posture. The tongue really grew flowers, and there must be a lot of "treasures" in the head.</p>
<p>But there is no shortage of Qing singing.</p>
<p>There are old people, middle-aged people, young people, and even children under the age of ten.</p>
<p>The journey is boring, and people are happy to listen to stories, listen to absurd lies, fabricated news, and self-made ditties.</p>
<p>People also like to watch funny postures; to see how high someone's chest is, how hard someone's muscles are.</p>
<p>But -</p>
<p>"I won't sell any more after selling two plasters."</p>
<p>There was no response.</p>
<p>"I only look at five phases, five phases, and I won't come any more."</p>
<p>In fact, there have never been five people for whom phases have been looked at.</p>
<p>So the ship is hot and unlonely: in addition to the sound of the machine, there is also the sad singing of "people asking for suffering."</p>
<p>In the West River, I also saw and heard a pair of blind people singing. Their faces were dark, and their beards were growing on the sides of their mouths. In order to find the green of "Xianshi" (copper coins), they would also sing a numb female tune when they started singing with a partial throat. The other was the husband, opening his big mouth and showing a mouthful of yellow teeth. So they sang answering lyrics, interspersed with teasing jokes. Terms such as "modern" and "dancing" suddenly collided with "dead ghost" and "declining old man", which made the ship laugh, and the hard work was slightly rewarded.</p>
<p>There are always such funny programs arranged on the river, and there are Qing singing that entertains people's "interests" (what interests?); "The Song of the Great River" has not been changed its music today, so I don't know whether "The Song of the River" is singing the rot of yesterday or the decadence of today?</p>

<h3>Preparations for the Zhejiang Provincial Document Exhibition: Opening on October 10th at the Zhejiang Provincial Library; Collection Sub-committees established in Shanghai, Beijing, and various regions of Zhejiang</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Library has a long history and comprehensive facilities. In the past four or five years, in addition to improving reading services, it has devoted considerable effort to collecting documents and books related to the province, and has frequently held exhibitions, implicitly becoming one of the academic and cultural centers of Zhejiang Province. The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, recognizing that there is only one provincial-level library in the entire province, has not only designated it to be responsible for guiding libraries throughout the province but also regularly assists its development. To promote the spirit of loving the province and the country by showcasing Zhejiang's historical documents, the Department of Education has specifically decided to hold the Zhejiang Document Exhibition on October 10th of this year, designating the Provincial Library to be in charge of hosting it. The library on Daxue Road will serve as the venue. The Department has separately hired scholars from inside and outside the province, as well as people from political and educational circles who care about academia, to serve as design committee members. The design committee will review and assist in the collection of exhibits, and a secretariat composed of library staff will handle preparations. The secretariat recently held its second meeting, where many discussions took place. The content of the exhibition has been determined, with detailed procedures for collecting exhibits. Generally, these include books (works, manuscripts, annotated versions of Zhejiang's past sages, and books related to Zhejiang), images (precious images of Zhejiang's past sages, paintings, pictures of historical sites and relics), calligraphy, paintings, rubbings from bronzes and stone inscriptions, and antiquities (focusing on those that are handwritings of Zhejiang's past sages). In addition, a special room will be dedicated to displaying the relics of revolutionary martyrs of Zhejiang Province. To maximize the effectiveness of the collection, in addition to Hangzhou, where design committee members will be divided into groups to assist in the collection, administrative inspectorates in various regions of Zhejiang Province will also establish sub-committees for collecting exhibits. One commissioner and one local elder will be appointed as directors. The Department has also instructed each county or district to hold its own county-level document exhibition separately within September. Furthermore, it has been decided to set up sub-committees for collecting exhibits in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Beijing. It is heard that Wu Leichuan and Ma Shuping have been asked to preside over the collection in Beijing. The Nanjing collection sub-committee was established in the middle of last month, with its office located at the China-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Board on Shanxi Road, and Zhu Jiahua and Liu Yimou have been appointed as directors. In Shanghai, the committee has hired many leaders and scholars from various sectors as design committee members, and it is heard that they have been communicating and coordinating. When Chen Xunzi, the director of the Zhejiang Library, attended the Library and Museum Association in Qingdao last month, he had substantial contact with Ye Yuhu, who was also present. It is heard that Chen will come to Shanghai soon to coordinate the collection of exhibits in Shanghai. The preparation office of the committee is located within the Provincial Library on Daxue Road in Hangzhou, and it is said that special brochures and registration forms are available for request.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Cotton Crop Affected by Wind and Rain; Cotton Prices Rebound</h3>
<p>The cotton market saw a rebound due to the rise in American cotton. News of a hurricane in the city caused anxiety, leading to a rush by small investors to cover their short positions, resulting in a sharp rise in market prices. It is believed that the hurricane and rain, if passing through cotton-growing areas along the Yangtze River and the coast, could easily cause unbloomed cotton bolls to fall off, potentially affecting the cotton harvest. Furthermore, the continuous decline in raw cotton prices, already exceeding six yuan, made a sharp rebound inevitable once the environment changed.</p>
<p>Prices Rise by Seven to Eight Dimes in Near and Distant Futures</p>
<p>The opening of spot cotton trading in the morning saw a significant increase, as American cotton continued to rise by seventeen to eighteen points, with an overall increase of over thirty points in three days. The cotton markets in Liverpool and Osaka were consistently strong, and the previously fatigued market atmosphere showed signs of a turnaround. The warning of a hurricane passing through the city further fueled excitement, with prices for all months rising by five to seven dimes. Companies such as Cheng Ji, Da Fu, Tong Ji, Da Feng, Zhen Da, Geng Feng, Sen Kang, Xin Cheng Chang, and Chang He sold off large quantities, with Chang He's sale of 10,000 dan being the largest. Japanese traders generally leaned towards short selling. However, small short sellers, mindful of the poor weather and estimates of a potential reduction in American cotton, frequently covered their positions. As a result, the final price was only five cents higher than yesterday's closing price. Sales included 12,500 dan by Chang He, 9,200 dan by Zhen Da, 5,000 dan by Da Fu, 5,900 dan by Cheng Ji, 4,100 dan by Tong Ji, 4,300 dan by Da Feng, 1,700 dan by Weng Chang, 1,800 dan by Ming De, 2,600 dan by Sen Kang, 3,100 dan by Shen Ji, 2,000 dan by Chang Feng, 7,000 dan by Xin Cheng Chang, and 2,800 dan by Yi Kang. Purchases included 10,900 dan by Run Kang, 6,200 dan by Yu Da, 4,300 dan by Da Ji, 2,500 dan by He Xing, 2,700 dan by Xing Chang, 2,700 dan by Ren Feng, 5,200 dan by Tai Chang, 3,600 dan by Yi Chang, 6,500 dan by Chang Feng, 2,000 dan by Heng Chang, and 3,500 dan by Tong He. The highest and lowest market prices for the day are listed below:</p>

<p>Tongzhou 44.25 Tongxing Factory purchased 1,000 bales.</p>
<h3>Raw Cotton is Firm and Expensive: Small Investors Cover Short Positions; Cotton Yarn Market Begins to Turn Around</h3>
<p>The yarn market previously suffered from a decline in raw cotton prices. Although spot sales were frequently active, the market showed little improvement. However, with the recent rebound in American cotton and news of a hurricane passing through the city, raising concerns about damage to cotton-growing areas along the Yangtze River and the coast, raw cotton prices have become firm and expensive. Small short sellers are covering their positions, leading to a turnaround in the yarn market yesterday, with prices gradually rising.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Rises by Around Two Yuan</p>
<p>The opening of spot yarn trading in the morning saw a significant increase, as American cotton continued to rise, and the cotton markets in Liverpool and Sanpin were both doing well. The news of an impending hurricane in the city boosted market sentiment, with prices for all months rising by 1.5 to 1.8 yuan. Companies such as Da Fu, Tong Ji, Da Chang, Xin Cheng Chang, De Da, and Da Feng sold off large quantities, while Heng Yi, Ming De, Shen Ji, and Chang Feng actively purchased. In addition, many small investors were covering their short positions. As a result, prices for all months rose by 1.5 to 2.2 yuan. Market activity slowed in the afternoon, and trading was less active. The closing price was 2 dimes lower for the near-term July contract, with distant futures unchanged and other months up by 2 to 3 dimes. Sales included 1,300 bales by De Da, 950 bales by Tong Ji, 900 bales by Da Feng, 1,100 bales by Jin Chang, 1,300 bales by Zhen Da, 1,000 bales by Xie Cheng, 4,950 bales by Xin Cheng Chang, 1,200 bales by Tong He, and 800 bales by Yong Da Shun. Purchases included 950 bales by Da Fu, 350 bales by Heng Yi, 2,250 bales by Ming De, 1,150 bales by Yu Da, 900 bales by Xing Chang, 2,400 bales by Tong Feng, 700 bales by Feng Tai, 1,650 bales by Shen Ji, 1,600 bales by Chang Feng, 1,200 bales by Da Chang, and 950 bales each by Da Chang Cheng and Chong An. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Spot Yarn	Highest Price	Lowest Price	Closing Price	Compared to Previous Day	Account Balance</p>

<p>Guangdong 350 Hankou 30 Ningbo 12</p>
<p>Changsha 90 Anqing 20 Peer 10</p>
<h3>American Cotton Absorption Becomes Smooth; Overseas Cotton Prices Rise Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday's opening of American cotton trading saw increases due to the upcoming government report, with local firms covering their positions. Favorable news from Liverpool and estimates of reduced cotton harvests led domestic and foreign traders to buy, with New Orleans making purchases. The selling of southern cotton and the closing of long positions were absorbed by buyers. There were few new outside participants. Spot demand was moderate. The clearance of transactions was smooth. Textile activity increased as prices fell. At the close, market conditions were extremely firm, with spot prices up by 18 points and futures prices up by 16 to 18 points. English cotton spot prices rose by 8 points, and futures prices rose by 3 to 7 points. Indian cotton traders bought, and speculators sold Oomras and Bengals, buying Broach. There were no relief measures for the southern cotton regions. European exporters bought Oomras during the price decline. Bengals rose by 0.5 rupees, Oomras by 1.25 rupees, and Broach by 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded to the left (telegram dated the 2nd):</p>
<p>American Cotton	Compared to Previous Day	Legal Tender	English Cotton	Compared to Previous Day	Legal Tender</p>
<p>October	2.65	Up 18	43.60	Spot 6.73	Up 8	30.50</p>
<p>December	2.165	16	43.60	9.636	7	48.00</p>
<p>January	2.69	17	43.80	16.28	6	47.50</p>
<p>March	2.73	17	44.00	11.618	4	46.9</p>
<p>May	2.80	18	44.30	12.618	3	46.9</p>
<p>July	2.80	16	44.20	1.619	4	47.0</p>
<p>Spot 12.05	18	45.10</p>
<p>Bengals 153.25	Up 0.50	27.90</p>
<p>Oomras 188.50	Up 1.25	33.60</p>
<p>Broach 22.75	Up 1.50	38.20</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast on the 3rd was that Broach would be 213.5 rupees, up 1.75 rupees; Oomras would be 190 rupees, up 1.5 rupees; and Bengals would be 154 rupees, up 0.75 rupees.</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Osaka on the 3rd, Sanpin yarn futures rose by 1.3 to 2.7 yuan, with near-term contracts at 211.9 yuan and distant contracts at 202.1 yuan. Cotton futures rose by 0.75 to 0.8 yuan, with near-term contracts at 66.45 yuan and distant contracts at 62.8 yuan.</p>
<p>Private Estimates Indicate American Cotton Production Lower Than Last Year</p>
<p>According to a telegram from New York on the 2nd, the Commercial Gazette's estimate of this year's new cotton production is 59.3%, with a production volume of 10,980,000 bales, a decrease of 532,000 bales compared to the previous year (August 5th).</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Factory Cloth Follows the Rebound in Yarn and Cotton; Actual Sales Also Show Some Improvement</h3>
<p>Yesterday's strong wind and rain were sufficient to impact cotton production, causing yarn and cotton prices to rebound, which in turn led to a rebound in cloth prices. Eastern piece goods, white cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, market cloth, and gray cloth rebounded by about 1 dime per piece. Market sentiment improved, and actual sales showed some improvement. Dyers on this street were actively collecting goods, purchasing fine cloth and fine twill from brands such as Wufuji Xiang, Longtou Lan, Shuangyu Yanghe, and Longmen, totaling over 300 pieces. The procurement of fine twill by Guangdong buyers from this factory has gradually developed. However, due to price differences, transactions were not yet very active. There were continued purchases of fine cloth, broadcloth, serge, line fabric, printed satin, light twill, bleached cloth, and other goods. Yunnan buyers purchased over 300 pieces of Shilin blue cloth, printed velvet, coarse cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill from factories such as Guanghua, Renfeng, and Hongzhang. The momentum for Sichuan buyers of blue cloth was not strong, and they were mainly purchasing previously ordered goods. As a result, the blue cloth market was affected by actual sales and the continued decline in raw gray fine cloth prices. Yesterday, Louchang Haoxia Tu blue cloth continued to fall by 2.5 dimes per piece, with the current price at 10.055 yuan. Northern Tianjin buyers slightly purchased heavy coarse cloth, broadcloth, line fabric, printed velvet, and twill velvet. However, the purchase of printed broadcloth, serge, and satin was greatly weakened by the news of tax reductions in Hebei and Chahar. It is said that the current imports of piece goods mainly consist of printed goods and 1.6-yuan velvet and other goods.</p>
<h3>Lower-End Woolen Fabrics Are Even More Scarce - Both Supply and Inventory in the Market Are Lacking</h3>
<p>The woolen fabric market has seen significant progress recently. With the arrival of autumn, actual sales have begun. Buyers from various regions are actively purchasing goods. Transactions of domestic yarn, wool, silk, and linen fabrics, as well as various Western and Eastern imports, are all reported to be brisk. Inquiries reveal that the inventory of goods in warehouses both inside and outside Shanghai is low, and the arrival of goods from foreign firms is also lacking. As a result, prices have risen, and there is a general sense that ordinary goods are in short supply. Market sentiment for lower-end goods is particularly strong, so industry confidence is very firm.</p>
