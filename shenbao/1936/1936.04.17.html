<p>— 朗</p>
<p>關於印度民族解放運動的消息已經很久沒有聽到了可是印度被壓迫民族之爭取獨立自由的解放運動仍在暗中積極進行並沒有中止其勢力且有驚人的發展最近全印大會通過許多極有重要意義的决議案就是一個顯例全印大會爲印度民族解放運動的重要指導機關由各界人士組成如甘地與尼赫魯輩均爲其中重要角色其內部份子雖稍複雜但在過去印度民族的獨立運動史上實佔極重要的地位此决在勒克諾召開大會歷時數日於十四日深夜始行閉幕通過要案十餘其中最重要者厥爲反對去年英政府所頒布之印度新憲法與不參加帝國主義戰爭就此二點可知今後印度民族解放運動的趨向茲分別述之</p>
<p>印度的新憲法是去年夏天由英國國會通過的這是數年來印度民族獨立運動的結果因爲大英帝國主義鑒於印度民族獨立運動的高漲就草凝這部新憲法允許印人以一小部的自治權藉以緩和革命的勢力新憲法的主要內容爲允許印度三萬五千萬人享有自治權中央與各省各組織政府其閣員對立法院負責國防外交與宗敎事件由總督主持至其他事件凡不礙及維持公安及保障少數民族利益與財政安定的特殊責任者則由總督與省長依照閣員的主張辦理觀此規定可知印政府的重要權力如外交軍事等都仍握在英帝國的手中而印度人民所得到的祇是一些不關緊要的權力連印度境內一般溫和獨立派之自治殖民地地位的要求也不曾予以滿足其不爲完全獨立運動者所贊成乃是當然的事可是有一部分高等印人却對於這種憲法已經有接受的傾向卽在以領導獨立運動爲任務的全印大會中也有一部人表示贊成主張接受但在這决勒克諾全印大會中反對派的主張已經獲得勝利了會長尼赫魯明顯地指此新憲法爲奴隸的新憲章志在鞏固英帝國統治權的束縛不過這新憲法的實行已經决定無法推翻於是尼赫魯就勸全印大會同人利用新憲法以奪取立法權並利用這立法權以作進行從經濟程序而造成政治的僵局我們現於全印大會對此新憲法的態度就可知此後印度的民族獨立運動决不會因英帝國的分化政策而緩和下去相反的却有更趨高漲的可能因爲印度的大衆所要求的是印度民族的完全獨立而脫離大英帝國的束縛啊</p>
<p>其次全印大會决議不參加帝國主義的戰爭這於印度民族解放的前途也有重大的關係我們知道在上决世界大戰中印人因惑於「民族自决」的口號已替英國犧牲很大可是結果仍沒有達到獨立的目的現在戰爭的危機日益緊迫英國又必將利用印人去作犧牲不過印人已受到一次很大的敎訓現在是再不會上當了所以這决大會就决定不參加帝國主義的戰爭這種决議一方面固然含有反英的意義想從它的羈絆下解放出來而在另一方面却表明印度不願參加帝國主義的戰爭而要準備聯合弱小民族去發動反帝的戰爭了</p>
<p>這决全印大會的决議雖然不多可是都含有極重要的意義此後印度的民族獨立運動必將走上更正確的道路而有更驚人的發展那是我們可以看到的</p>

<p>— Dr.　Ralph　W.　Chaney原著　陳紹燕譯</p>
<p>最早原始人的飲食習慣，我們只有憑推想而知。在一百萬年以前，我們人類的祖先，還沒有學會書寫的技術，所以也沒有遺留下食品的單子，或是烹調方法這一類的書籍，可以作為他們選擇食品的證據。</p>
<p>我們從現代大猿類的食性推想起來，可以假定他們兼食植物和動物。這種雜食的食物，早期人類化石齒牙的性質也暗示着。这一类齒牙，似乎適於咀嚼種類繁多的食物，其中肉類和植物都有。</p>
<p>在早期人類的實筆法紀錄裏面，直至最近為　，找不出關於他們的食物的確實證據。爪哇直立猿人（Pithecanthropus　e　tus）在一八九一年方始發現，但所能代表的，他僅有頭蓋骨的一部份，和幾片殘餘的骨骼而已。貢國畢爾脫頓的初期人或古猿人，（Eoanthropus,pildown）其所代有的史料也不完全，除他所有的齒牙所能供給的材料外，關於食物和飲食的習慣，從業沒有人提出過疑問和討論。</p>
<p>此問題直至第三種原人發現，方才解决。此種原人，也如上述之直立猿人和初期人一樣，遠在冰河時代的初期生存着。這樣，也可說是我們最初祖先實際居住的地方被發現了。</p>
<p>中國地質調查會的會員，在寶維生勃拉克博士Dr.　Davidson　Black指導之下，於過去六年中，掘得不少頭蓋骨和許多在亞洲居住最古原人的齒牙。還有在這些古代穴居者的老家裏，發掘得許多石器，火爐底，和尚未吃過的食物殘片。這可算是關於亞洲已知的最古人類的食品的第一次紀錄了。</p>
<p>千百萬年以前，在淺海裏沉澱着和們停積着的許多石灰　，現在在中國故都北京附近的西山顯露出來了。由於地下泉的溶解力，山　穿成了不少窟洞，這些窟洞，給中國古代原人做過居住的塲怕，給海乙那和別種獸類，做過地下的巢穴。有一部分的窟洞，因為巖石的碎片，時時由洞頂和洞壁落下，已有被塞住的情形。這些落下來的碎片，經過含有石灰質滲下來的水的停積作用，逐漸膠結而成為堅固的硬塊，平常通稱為角礫石（Breccia）。</p>
<p>歲月慢慢地過去，一直到了我們的時代，中國的工人們到山裏來開掘石灰石了，他們預備將這些石類石做建築的材料，或做道路的基石。他們遇到了這些不整齊的起角礫石塊，因為質地不純粹，所以一向是沒有動過。在一九二三年裏，很有聲望的瑞典古生物學家安特生氏（J.G.Anderson）曾將這角礫石塊加以研究，並且在石內發現了不少在中國北部已經絕跡的　牛，野牛，和其他獸類的化石骨骼。在這樣辛苦發掘工作之下，從這些含有化石骨骼的角礫石塊裏面，竟揭開了亞洲人類最古的歷史！</p>
<p>周家店鎭，位置在北平西面三十英里，是一個內地開掘煤塊和採取灰石的中心點，年幾前已有一條鐵路通到那裏，將那些笨重的產　運到北平，但是因為近年來中國北聞政治的不安定，有時將運輪用的車輛，從事於戰爭的活動。結果很長的駱駝隊，全是亞洲內　雙　駝，踏着沉重的步調，在這富有灰沙的大路上出現了，並且時常也行躭誤時光的驢子，跋涉着延長的山坡到那礦密裏去。</p>
<p>在周家店上面的小山上，傍近山洞的地方，積存骨化石最多，中國地質調查會在那裏建造了一個極舒適的試騐所，和那些從事發掘的科學工作人員的住宅。那裏時常有參觀的人從世界各處到來，連許多著我聽人類學家和占生物學家在內，為的是看看這最早人類最完全的紀錄。山旁滿佈着目洞内搬出的角礫石的残塊，洞的入口入，上面有巖石器住，可避强烈的日光。</p>
<p>這似乎是實在的：在守去的時候，這裏有過一個或多個進出口，被原人或獸類當作門路的。這些洞門大約已經陷沒和塞住了，所以他們在將來發掘的過程中，或許能發現更重要的事實，為現在所未知的。自石灰石夾道中下去，距現在出入口深至六十英就的地方，巖洞的底層就達到了，這就是亞洲最古居民的　實住宅！這裏，已被許多尺的角礫石蓋住，並且錄得許多頭骨，從這些頭蓋骨看來，我們知道這人類祖先所有的智慧，已達到了羣獸水平綫以上。</p>

<p>現任軍事參議院院長陳調元與已故遼寗高志淸（名鏡）有舊、民國二年時、馮國璋以副總統兼任江蘇督軍、高充馮之高等顧問、而陳其時則任憲兵司令、過從頗密、交誼益篤、嗣陳為督軍更以高為秘書長、未幾締結兒女親家、高以長女字陳次子、自是</p>
<p>愈形密切　　至民國十七年、乃合資開設豫成公司、專銷鄱樂產煤公司與鄱樂煤礦、訂立專銷該礦出品之合同、當時陳付資十五萬元、高付資本兩萬元、陳充公司董事長、高任經理、詎一年之後、鄱樂所負豫成之債、竟達十三萬三千數百金、經豫成訴由法院判决連同利息照數分期歸償、而陳卽將彼對於此欵應得之債權、</p>
<p>舉以贈高</p>
<p>蓋陳因次子不願娶高女為妻、斯時業已解除婚的、深對高抱歉、故除將高之長女認為乾女外、復以應得之債權相贈、藉示調濟之意也、上年八月間、高病革時、特書遺囑、以鄱樂債權分給其媳高于秀芸·高盛眞卿·及孫高澤溥·高澤厚·等、隨由承襲諸人聯名具呈第一特區地方法院</p>

<p>鄱樂三萬</p>
<p>三千元、分文未交付原吿、被其化名存於銀行、及臨死竟將其所保管而屬於豫成之欵、列入遺囑、俾其遺族得不法利益、迨高志淸死後、被吿尙向鄱樂私收六千元、是以訴請判令被吿等償還國幣三萬九千元、以及利息云云、高等被控、亦延史良律師抗辯、首述陳高相交有素、合資經商、為</p>
<p>兒女訂姻</p>
<p>嗣因子女意見不合、解除婚的、陳乃以所得債權悉以贈高之經過事實、次言原吿以豫成公司名義起訴不適格、陳蔭南以法定代理人名義、亦不合法之理由、末謂陳調元昔以債權相贈被告、有種種物證人蹬、堪資證明、乃其今於故人已亡之後、</p>

<h3 id="c197">溫俠玉 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 龍貢公</p>
<p>自從那年輕的失業鐵匠到我這里住下之後，溫俠玉就變成一個驚怯而害羞的姑娘了。臉白得和　紙一樣，長着許多小小的紅色的暗瘡。粗大的骨骼不自然地顫傈着，聲音　匹綿羊似地低沉而緊滯，常常嘆氣而說不出話。我們那對靠放債過活的房東去婦請我們吃開燈飯的時候，這位房東小姐却什麼都吃不下，而且打破了一隻調羹。</p>
<p>她經過我們房門口，步伐就莊重起來。有時故意跌落什麼東西，然後紅着臉，瘋裏瘋氣地把那件東西拾起來。……這個驕傲的中學生從前是只讓我看見一副石板一樣的臉孔的。</p>
<p>年輕鐵匠出去了的一個禮拜天早上，天氣很暖和，刮肉的北風已經停止，黃色的雲球在空中從容不迫地沉下來又浮上去。溫俠玉撞進我房間裏來了，她底姿勢好像被一個人在背後猛力撞碰了一下似地……簡直是跳進來。</p>
<p>「你知道小鐵匠這個傢伙　？……唉，你不知道的……」她激動地說，眼睛不安定地旋轉着。「他簡直向我表示愛情</p>
<p>「有這麼一回事？」</p>
<p>「是的，有這麼一回事。雖然我們住在一間房屋裏，」她彷彿回憶着什麼似地頓了一頓，接着說：「他倒常常給我寫信的。我們還沒有認眞說過話。不過一個打鐵仔會寫信——做出這種聰明能幹的事，究竟是少有的呀！」</p>
<p>我底驚訝溶解了。我知道那年輕人寫過許多信給她，而關於愛情的句子一個也不曾有過。請她坐下，斟了一杯茶給她，我對着一面鏡子——那就是窗檑裏的，後面糊了報紙的一塊玻璃，在拔我自己的鬍鬚。</p>
<p>「你答應過和他通信的嗎？」我道樣問了。</p>
<p>「答應過？——我沒有說過什麼。不過……是的，就是這個樣子……他常常寫信遞給我。」</p>
<p>「他在賣弄他底文才麼？」</p>
<p>「不！你看，他寫給我關於夫妻事情的信！」溫俠玉做出顯明的嚴肅能度，說。「我知道這年輕仔底用意——很簡單的用意。」</p>
<p>「他寫的信有使你佩服的地方沒有？這小孩子受着社會上不公平的待遇，但是他却要在所有的機會裹表現自己的才能。」我明白地說了。</p>
<p>「我可憐他。」她這樣承認，</p>
<p>「有時我倒反而覺得他這樣過活很有意思，而我自己是平淡無味的。他好像什麼都知道，這鬱鬱不樂的年輕人，還有很不錯的文學天才。——學校裹面不容易找出一個兩個哩！」</p>
<p>我還沒有答話，她又迷惑地，歇斯的里地說了。</p>
<p>「無論如何，他不應該老早存道樣的念頭。他應該承認那是他底幻想。就是這麼說，他也是太快了呀！……這樣　個人，我和他說一句話都不會有人贊成的。……你知道他底性格了，他很驕傲：我甚至這樣告訴過他，我說，『你老是把那些土話混進去，如果你是一個學生，你會知道改卷子的先生要怎樣駡你！」……是的，他眞是又偏執又頑固，不像一個年輕人……」</p>
<p>我問她：「你為什麼要把這些吿訴我呢？」</p>
<p>「你吿訴他，把一切都告訴他——」</p>
<p>她並非出於本意地說了，而且突然中止。開頭她是無意中掉進我底房間裹的——她使我這樣感覺到，現在她覺得陌生起來了。她不安定地朝我們底牀舖，堆着臉盆，漱口盂和裝鞋的紙盒子的墻角落，和別的地方張望着。她從前不會獨自走進過我們底房間的。</p>
<p>「或許，這樣是很不好的。」她一會兒之後改正地說。「我和你談談並沒有別的意思……凡是我們講過的話，你還是一句都不要對他說吧。」</p>
<p>四月十四，一九三六。</p>
<h3 id="c198">春遊 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 江京</p>
<p>到龍華去，是到放春假前一天才决定的，可說非常倉卒。决定的經過，說來也好笑。要不是男先生想藉這機會和女先生去玩，還不會特地在孩子們頭上着想哩。不幸，女先生終於沒有去。這使這次短程旅行，顯然地受了影響。</p>
<p>自然，孩子們是不明白這些的。當先生們在自已課堂內宣佈要到龍華去旅行的，大家都快活的起哄了。天天都是死板板地上課下課，多討人厭呵！「我去」！「我去」的叫聲，從各人口里噴出來。</p>
<p>都市的孩子們實在被店房，煤烟壓閉得太利害了，允其是這批家境淸寒的孩子們。除了天空，他們看不見自然，就是大地，也被人蒙住了本來面目，因此，他們一到了這半村半市的郊外，也覺什麼都新奇。誰先看見一株揚柳，就急口嚷着「楊柳！楊柳！」誰先看見一具紙蔦，就急口嚷着紙蔦的名字，或是蝴蝶，或是蜈蚣，而其餘的孩子，也就跟着嚷起來，好像比賽聲音高大似地嚷起來。</p>
<p>我們到了打浦路　衢路口。本來，應該向右折到康衢路去的，但孩子們堅執着要沿着前面的鐵路走。「鐵路上有橋哩，會走花眼睛的！」我警戒他們說。</p>
<p>「不會的！」</p>
<p>「唔！不當心，會跌下河里去，！」</p>
<p>「不會的！」</p>
<p>這次無論我怎麼說都不靈了，他們總是把「不會的，」「不會」的來回駁你。這有什麼辦法呢？其實鐵路上的走道雖然沒有馬路寬，却沒有跟着脚起來的煤屑。步子踏下去，一步就是一步。孩子們自然不理會這許多，他們偏偏故意去踏枕木邊的石子，還要從鐵路上穿過來穿過去。像這樣的傻事，他們幹得頂高興。</p>
<p>陸軍弟五師陣亡將士的紀念塔立在我們面前了。一個年紀較大的孩子正經地對同伴說：</p>
<p>「鞠躬！喂，鞠躬！是紀念「　　八」的哩！」把帽子脫下，鞠了三個躬，有幾個也照着他的樣做了。</p>
<p>現在，我們踏上了龍華的市街，馬路兩旁，仍然是房子，和上海一樣，反而沒有上海的房子這樣　。「這就是龍華嗎？」孩子們簡直不相信這是他們一心想到的地方。</p>
<p>幸而龍華不就是這樣。領隊的先生，首先把我們帶到寺裏去。裏面人眞多。菩薩也多。但更多的是香紙的烟霧，無論那個殿堂裏，都被牠們充滿了。有的殿堂上，簡直把你的眼淚都烟了出來，使你實在沒有法子忍將下去。</p>
<p>寺的前面是報恩塔。這時開放了，任人登臨。這成為孩子們高興的地方。他們一定要上去。上去看，照規矩，每人得出一毛錢。不過我們受了優待，一共只化了兩毛。當我們踏上塔內的扶梯時，我覺到一種責任的恐怖，一要是塔倒下來了……。」雖然我們都平安地出來，總覺得是帶着他們冒了一次險。</p>
<h3 id="c199">山茶欣賞 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 緣　　　箋</p>
<p>孩子們本還想去看桃花的，可是問問別人，也不曉得什麼地方有桃花。現在，我們只有飛機場好看了。</p>
<p>吃過飯！其實吃的是五分錢一碗的光麵！後，因為到飛機場還有一些路，就先在寺左邊的一個公園裏去休息。這裏也有一個陣亡將士紀念塔，孩子們却沒有鞠躬。免得孩子們口渴，先生每人分了一些甘蔗，因為有的孩子沒有吃飽，又每人分了兩個牛肉饅頭。性急的孩子，就在這時把柳枝和桃花買好了。</p>
<p>一走進飛機埸的門，就聽到嗡嗡的聲音。一隻飛機正在預備起飛。這眞是孩子們的好運氣。他們高興地喊了一聲「哦——，去看呀」以後，就拔脚飛跑過去了，把我們遠遠的丟在後面。有一個年紀頗大的女孩子，一心只顧看，不曾留心脚下，竟被路旁的水槽坑陷得跌了一交，引得塲內修草的工人們直到我們走過時還在那里</p>
<p>那隻飛機飛得看不見了。可是場內還有其他的飛機在修理。孩子們就又把牠包圍起來。這時，有一個孩子用手摸了一下飛機的翅膀，被工人喝了一聲，眼看着這孩子露出了非常窘迫的狀態。</p>
<p>飛機的翅膀旣然不好摸，他們的注意又傾注在廣大的草塲上。多廣大呵。多靑綠呵。多好翻筋斗呵。他們被牠誘惑了。他們一窠蜂似的直向草塲中心衝去。不幸，剛跑了幾步又被看守人禁止了。他們只好呆呆地瞪着草地出神。</p>
<p>唉！我們用什麼方法去滿足這項難滿足的孩子們的心呢？</p>
<h3 id="c200">第一次的失望淚 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 臧克家</p>
<p>「中央在招海軍」。</p>
<p>訓育主任把從濟南帶來的這個消息當衆宣佈了之後，辦公室鬥前人山人海的了。個個口中咕嚕着什麼，嘴角貼上了笑，彷彿一條光明的捷徑展開在大家面前。</p>
<p>「走開，走開，個子大的不要！」</p>
<p>這幾句話像一陣無情的風把前邊的潮流吹落了。年齡大點的不消說帶着失望走開了，年紀差不多而身是高一點的直抱怨自己不該長得這麼長！</p>
<p>「老師，看看我行不」？</p>
<p>一些自己覺得有點希望的孩子，仰起臉等訓育主任的一句答話。笑和擺手代替了回答。然而黏黏纏纏地都不肯去，好似這辦公室門前的土地可以種下他們的希望。</p>
<p>「　度不合，往返白打路費，說着你們不聽」！</p>
<p>訓育主任放下了話手裏拾起了布尺來。這尺子是無情的，你到它身前去一站，它便可以一言不發的去取你。個子稍高一點的微微的屈一屈身子學着尺蠖，在布尺黑盡的面下面頭不敢抬起來。</p>
<p>布尺是鐵面的，多少人通不過它的允許失意的走開了。</p>
<p>翻開眼皮沙眼，露出手臂來相你的皮膚，訓育主任像一個關心着學生健康的醫生。</p>
<p>檢來檢去，一大灘沙中只檢出七粒黃金。</p>
<p>這七個幸運者雖是班次不同，不過年紀和身材都差不多，如果他們立在一起比一比的話，至多差不了一頭，　耳根。</p>
<p>他們與奮的忙着凑路費，忙着借自行車，為了省錢，决定不坐汽車，不坐火車。臨走的那天早晨，七個人排成一行列走出了大門，一堆一簇的同學眼送他們去了，回頭來更討厭了書本，覺得自己的前途更茫茫了。拾起一本破講義來用苦燥的腔調哼着：</p>
<p>「舊巢合是啣泥燕，</p>
<p>飛上枝頭變鳳凰」！</p>
<p>這七人的小行列出了校鬥，六個人踏上了自行車，最小的一個淋生（最可愛的一個孩子）附在別人的車後做一條尾巴，這天黃風大作，沙塵如雨，推動着希望的車輪去　盡　百里陌生的道路。這七個孩子都是第一决離開鄉土，淋生臨走再三請求訓育主任：</p>
<p>「請老帥打封信和我母親說說」。</p>
<p>同學們對他們的艷羨心還沒有淡盡，而這七人的行列忽然又給漫天的黃風吹回來了。聽到這消息我趕到寢室裹去問他們才知道高度合格的只有淋生一人，而他因為怕孤獨，所以也一同回來了。看他們人人一臉塵土，跨在床沿上像一塊石頭。年紀　　的到心底也大，在妞妮之餘還向同學們誇濟南　勝，我也用「塞翁失馬」的話　安他們。最後我到了淋生的屋裏去，冷淸淸只他一個人在擁着厚被睡，我叫醒他見他眼眶中含着淚。我用各樣的話來暖他的小心，然而他的眼淚却呌我的話碰落了一臉。</p>

<p>— 隅</p>
<p>時間雖見極短的一剎那，可是印象却是很深刻的。我從逼狹兩旁　曲道路的大石叢中，爬上天平山的絕頂，山風從後面吹來，雲從頂上　下，雨從橫面　點　點打在我的面上，我想呼吸一口自由的空氣，　我心中的焦慮，已使我沒有這樣的幽閒。人總共　有　個的，半途上退回了一　，能够一同登到絕頂的，只有三　，而三個人當中，各人都有　副嚴重的面目，也同樣有　副嚴重的心情，我不能從他們的面上表情，了解他們心中的蘊藏的感情是怎樣，正如他們不能了解我的一樣。把　從大衣角中猛力地抬平，看到四周起伏着的山，把當中形成一橢圓形的大谷，松樹隨山的斜度，成功高低的行列。松樹的枝幹在風中擺舞着，似乎在歡迎我們這一羣。牠們澎湃的吼聲，又似乎威嚇我們這一羣，因為牠們早巳感覺到我們這一羣身上都有着濃厚的都市氣息，而不是生活於牠們懷抱，或居住在牠們的邊緣的人呀。我們是山　的陌生客，自然不希望有什麼生靈歡迎，也不恐懼什麼生靈的威嚇。　情調牠們已領會。我們從夾着使人容易滑跌的沙屑的烏道中前進，沒有聽到春天鳥的鳴聲，也沒有什麼烏因為我們的走過向驚起。只有遠處的和山頂飛得差不多高下的幾隻餓鷹，發出慘厲而響亮的叫聲，一聲聲打入我們的心坎。牠們的呌聲，自然並不是為我們而發。牠們是與我們漠不相關的，　在我們有這樣感覺，而在牠們也許連　樣感覺都沒有。因此我們覺到牠們的存在，可是牠們孤獨而猛　地般旋，集中牠們的汴意力於覓食的工作　　可沒有覺得　我們的存在</p>
<p>我　　，　為牠們勇感，我可惡鷹，因為牠們的貪酷，和牠們的排他，雖則有我們偉大的詩人為牠辯護過「駑鳥之不羣兮，自前世而固然，」雖則意大利的志士，自由主義者瑪志尼在他著的有名的「歌德與拜輪」論中，說歌德與拜輪是十九世紀初　的盤旋於天際的餓鷹，他倆慘厲而失望的絕叫，震撼那時歐洲大陸的人心（大意如此，因手頭無此書，無從查考。）但我們這時代的特徵，已不是個人內心的煩悶，而是大衆生活的慘痛。過去與現在的分水嶺，似乎就在這地方。作為十九世紀初葉文學特徵的代表「浮士德」與「曼佛萊德」，我們從歌德講到拜輪的幾句話中：「這位特出的有才智的詩人（指拜輪）會把我的浮士德化為他自已，並且從道當中提鍊了極强的滋養品給他的憂鬱的趣味。他有他的個別的方法，有他自己的目的，利用內心衝動的力，因此所有那些都不是原來的了，也就特別因為這原故，我不能不贊美他的天才，」可以知道，這兩部傑作，有其共同時代的特徵。但我還不够了解浮士德，我不懂德文，郭鼎堂先生中譯本的浮士德第一部，以及英譯本的浮士德全部，我雖讀過一遍，可是我並沒有怎樣感動，反之，拜輪的曼　萊德，當我還是一個單純幼稚的孩子從那血腥的人間逃回來以後，關閉在一個小閣樓上，翻開這詩劇來讀的時候，却給我內心一個極大的衝動。尤其當曼佛萊德將死的時候，排拆那穿了死人外衣的敎士說敎，激起了我心底的反應。</p>
<p>你沒有力量及於我，我感覺到，　　你將永不會統屬我，我也知道，　　我所已經做成的事　，是故成了；我內心羅藏着</p>
<p>一個創痛，不會從你那兒得着什麼；　　永恒的心使牠自己</p>
<p>作牠的良善思想或罪惡思想的報應——</p>
<p>是牠自己的罪惡的開始也是罪惡的終結——</p>
<p>並且牠自已的空與時——牠的內在的感能當解除了這無常性——</p>
<p>從流動不居的外物得不着什麼顏色；　　而集中於痛苦或快樂之中</p>
<p>而這些乃從荒蕪的心地中知識所生出。　　你不曾誘惑我，你也不能誘惑我；　　我不是你的傀儡，也不是你的俘虜——　　但過去我是我自己的毀滅者，並且將來也還</p>
<p>一直是我自己的毀滅者。——退開，你這欺騙的魔鬼，</p>
<p>死神的手是接近了我——但不是你的！</p>
<p>曼佛萊德如果是拜輪的化身，那末拜輪在我心目中，他的可尊敬，就在他的反抗的精神，他的崛强的性格。世間最討厭的東西就是那些穿了黑的外衣的庸俗而煩瑣的說敎者。他們用欺騙的手段，想把你的良心換去，想把你的目標轉移開去，想把你的與客觀的環境所引起的失調而造成的痛苦，用麻醉性的藥劑，暫時止痛一下，他從你的身上，剝奪了好多東西，而他决沒有給你一件的東西。總之他為了維持那從泥土掘出來的腐朽的木偶以及木偶所放在裹面的那罪惡的神宇的尊嚴，不惜用任何手段。你假使有了自覺，有了一副銳利的眼，看穿了這一切，同時假使你還有一點原始的勇氣，或者有把這腐朽的木偶隨手擊毀的雄心，你就將見到那穿了黑的衣服的敎士，眼也紅了，嘴也歪了，毛孔上也噴着熱的水蒸氣了，他會把最初某一部落社會遺留下來的敎條或道德律，一條一條地推陳於你的面前，而　你　：按照某種敎條或道德律，你應該受懲罰，按照某種敎條或道德律，你應該入地獄，按照某種敎條或道德侓，你應該失去了你的靈魂，如果這樣的敎條或道德律，不能說服你，那末他就會用木偶的名義，說你是　個異端，一個撒旦的信仰者，因為你有兩隻明郎的眼，你的眼須挖去，你有兩隻活動的手，你的手須砍去，你有一個較公正的良心，你的心須剖開，你有一個傳達你的思潮的舌，你的舌須拔去，甚至他認為你巳到相當的年齡，你沒有多大的能力活動了，你也許會生長出一個更聰明更優秀的第二代，會繼承你的思想行動，於是最野蠻而最根本的辦法出現了，他們會將你消滅生殖的能力，這種中國古已有之的方法，我們在現代拿科學做護符的某種人所代表的某一種社會的法律上看到。</p>
<p>這樣黑衣敎士的說敎，這樣蠻俗的遺留，從二十世紀的初期，還是和十九世紀的初期一樣，我們並沒有看到質的方面有多大的變化，而只見其氣雾更　為濃厚，雖　從一羣欺騙者的社會基礎上，早已埋藏了一個爆發性的藥引，但這藥引要　出鮮明有色的火花，在時間上，似乎還要等待。不過蚊可悲憫的，是　些吸牧了時代毒質的Pgukustube們，他們認為拿人家的血肉來滋養那些黑衣敎士，　而從中得些　餘，認為這是應該的。他們鼓吹侵略，鼓吹殘殺，結果世界人類受了他的　毒，他們自己，他們子孫，也受了這樣的命運。一九三六年之與一九一四年，其類似之點是很多的。而最可悲憫的，自然不是那些死者，而是我們這　生者，我們這些生者是太無恥太無勇敢太無良心了。大戰時因反　戰爭而被捕人里分瓦斯獄（Leavenworth　Prison）的詩人查伯林（Ralpn　Cnaplin）他的「悲悼並不是對死者」的一首詩，足以使我們這些怯懦的人羞愧：</p>
<p>悲悼並不　　那　躺在　凉大地上的死者</p>
<p>屍體接連着屍體——</p>
<p>靜穆慈愛的大地撫慰着一切死的人</p>
<p>像一切人都必　的　樣；</p>
<p>悲悼並不是　你們被俘的同伴，你們須拘入</p>
<p>太堅牢而不能掙　的——</p>
<p>每個如鐵棺材的　　中，</p>
<p>活埋在那兒；</p>
<p>比較還是悲悼那些無情的羣氓——</p>
<p>那膽小與　柔　的人</p>
<p>他們看到世界的極　不幸和錯悞</p>
<p>而不　講。</p>
<p>我們應該有這樣的勇　把世界一切罪惡指示出來。但事實是　樣呢？我們如果反躬目問，我們都　在抹煞　實，做世界上最無恥最下流的騙子。這自有其客觀的原因，剷除這原因，須得集合的力量，而不是那些十五世紀文學家文學中所表現的，一個勇敢的巨人（Titan）的力　所能辦到；也不是把個人內心的苦悶，深刻地表　於文學上就能盡其任務。我們須有絕大的勇氣，向共同的目標　進。造成普遍的虛偽，自有其客觀的原因，這　觀的原因，究竟是什麼呢？自然不是　二語所能盡。一天我曾聽到一個故事，這故事內容雖很粗淺，意義却頗深刻，這故事的情節大概這樣：有　個富人用了　筆很大的獎金預備賞給一個在社會上發生最大影響的謊。結果有三個人都　要求得這筆獎金。第一個是發生絕大影響的謊的製造者，　為謊，是他製造的，獎自應給他；第二個　謊的傳播者，沒有他，謊不會發生影響，獎應給他。也頗有理；第三個是謊的保持者，沒有他，謊不會流傳下去，獎應給他，更有充分的理由。這一個人都要求這筆獎金，而不肯退讓，富人沒有辦法，於是請敎於一位聰明的法官。法官的判決，却出乎這三人意料之外。法官認為他們三人都沒有資格領獎，而獎應該給第四個，被忘記的人（ahe　Fogcitenman）——社會。這法官是頗懂　理，而其判决，也是高明的。</p>
<p>所以我們如果把現社會　切造成的不幸歸結到個人，某一羣人的特有的貪慾，或者人類的罪惡，歸結到個人內心的衝動，這是歪曲了事實，轉移了人類向光明的目標。心靈主義的哲學家由內心出發，丟開了客觀的現實，轉而向個人的內心，以求達於平治天下，我終　到是一種病在者的幻想。中國歷史幾十年來走來走去都走着循環的路程，恐怕就是這些庸俗哲學所造成。但這條路子至今還有人在拿了鋤頭，鍫，石滾，在那兒做修補的工作，結果我想一定是在草萊中掩沒掉他們修補的工程，而修補的人也死在草萊當中的。在另一方面，不甘死在草萊的人，自然，本着其不甘為奴隸的面目，挺出他那不甘塡平卑怯者墳墓的硬朗身體，拔出爭自由的劍，發着餓鷹般的叫喊，正面地對着侵略我們殘殺我們刦奪我們的一切。畸形社會下所造成而甘為這畸形社會做支持者分其殘餘掠奪物的敵人。</p>

<h3 id="c204">救濟春荒的辦法 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 筱山</p>
<p>「中央社西安電」陝南春荒嚴重，窮僻之區，樹皮草根，己為主要食物。省賑會正籌賑救辦法，擬籌七萬元辦理賑濟。</p>
<p>軍委會蔣委員長，昨令湖北省政府，略謂：頃據報稱，宜昌災荒嚴重，竟發生飢民奪食等情形，懇令迅飭救濟，以資維持，等情，除指令外，仰卽迅籌有效救濟辦法具報，以憑核奪……</p>
<p>生活在土地肥沃的江南的人們，似乎不知道有春荒，正好像年前西北的水旱災，那兒有幾千萬的災民，慘缺而死的不知有多少，而在江南的人們都好像沒有受怎麼的影饗，在上海，我們更不曾夢到春荒的慘劇吧。</p>
<p>現在，陝南的一帶的春荒，跟湖北省二十多縣的春荒又在亂荒的年頭出現了。從報紙上的消息，我們可以看到。陝南的大衆們，樹皮草根已成為主要食物，如果再延遲下去，我們相信他們連潤濕的泥塊也沒得喫了。在湖北宜昌的一樣，也同樣地，奪食，為了生存，弄得秩序上紊亂得很，就是湖北的全省，也在風雨盪動的危機中，我們不會忘記，去年襄漢長江水災以後，湖北省境內有許多縣分是鬧過秋荒的，當時已無法救濟，而今年的春荒，勢必嚴重了十倍</p>
<p>然而，這荒年，比較窮僻的省份，不僅是湖北陝西，就是共他許多省分，經濟的破產，已不是一天兩天的事，而是長久的普遍的現象。我們當局者確曾有過許多賑災會的事業出現，可是，那不過是表面的救濟，而不是根本上的救濟。我們從過去看到現在。災害，匪亂，到處一樣，人民的生命早已到了沒法掙扎的地步，每一决災害，不是死，就是逃亡，逃亡到那兒去呢？終歸是死，因為到處都是在經濟破產的底下，並不是臨時想想救濟的辦法，就可以的。反之，那完全是沒有用處。</p>
<p>從消息上看來，陝南已到了絕路時侯了，省賑會才「正籌賑辦法，擬籌七萬元辦理賑濟。」我想，賑會是應該早些去設法救濟的，現在才去想法，恐怕人民已多死亡了。</p>
<p>在湖北，人民因奪食而起了互爭的事實，也可以證明了，我們不事先設法，去防止災害，而災害以後，又不能澈底的着實去救濟。正到事發了許久，才决定了過去的老花樣的辦法：「除一面竭力籌集賑欵散放，並一面電請中央撥發春賑，增發義賑外，仍盼當局予以根本救濟辦法，俾期消弭於無形以維民命……」我們明白，那一套辦法，數年來都一樣的，而救濟名為救濟，災荒依然產生，而且日甚一日，所謂根本辦法，我們還是垂死的等候着，却不知何時才出現吧了！</p>
<h3 id="c205">醉 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 牧野</p>
<p>「走……我不走；我睡在你這里……小嫂子……」他含糊的咕嚕着。</p>
<p>店夥們又笑起來。</p>
<p>「笑什麼笑…」說着她自己也嘔笑了。她曉得他醉了就弄這一套的，她大聲向他嚷着：「快滾回去吧，你老婆跟着和尙跑了，你這隻活烏龜……」女店主笑得說不下去了，她搖　着腰肢，笑的接不上氣來。</p>
<p>那個像瘋在了一樣，張大了佈滿血絲的可怕的眼睛，一隻拳頭重重的打在桌子上，桌上的東西振得一跳，他在懷里掣出了一把鋒利的刀子，這刀子「咯支」的一聲給他揷在桌子里了，他哭起來。</p>
<p>女店主弄得呆住了。</p>
<p>「回去吧，呌他們把你送回去，呌輛車好嗎…」女店主怕他肇禍，向他軟軟地說着，聲調似乎在哀求他了。</p>
<p>「我不，我不回去…」他哭着說，倒像一個頑皮的孩子了，店夥們看熱閙高興了，又要笑出來，牠狠狠地瞪了他們一眼。「…我不回去…我回去要生氣的…我要嫉妬，我恨不得殺死那些霸佔我老婆的混蛋…你不曉得：你不曉得：呵！我底老婆是個……」</p>
<p>「你老婆是個啥？呵…」</p>
<p>「你不曉得，她每天夜里要呌別人樓着哩…這是我呌她幹的，沒有錢，沒有錢，哼…」他自己打着耳光。女店主忍不往「吃吃」的笑了。）</p>
<p>「好了，少說幾句醉話吧，連長，</p>
<p>醉話，不是醉話！你不信你去看看，看着她呌那個忘八蛋玩弄着……」他哭了…女店主在臉上也消逝了笑容。</p>
<p>沉默了一會兒，他一下子站起來，掏出了一把錢，什麼也沒有說就衝出去了，女店主的心上像是落了一塊石頭，</p>
<p>「天呵，眞想不到……」一句話沒有說完，李大魁又跟蹌着進來了，他走到桌子前，　下了那把鋒利的刀子，就離開了這　小酒店。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c206">人生一課 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 家人</p>
<p>冬季辰光，午後太陽便老是躱藏在烏雲層裏去了。　機關的辦公室，開亮着幾盞明晃晃的電燈，有十多個人佔頒着這屋子，却靜悄悄地，都低着頭，各各用着筆在寫在謄抄，遂使落在紙面上筆尖沙沙的走動聲。越發淸晰，而躺在牆根邊那兒的火爐，紅烘烘的火舌不時畢剝地跳響，總把沉寂的氣氛劃破了。</p>
<p>有張方臉孔，有付呌人厭惡的書明着是量勢利型的嘴眼的庶務員，掀開厚土布門簾進來，隨着吹入一陣冷冷的風，和他的脚步聲逗引了十八對眼晴本能的注射到他身上，不滿意地瞥了瞥，又縮回去。庶務員毫不在乎儘自走向角落裏出納課職員姓李的桌前，將手中一個紅色大信封望桌上神氣地一擲。另後手持着下巴的短鬍子站着。</p>
<p>「什麼事？」姓李的停停筆，笑着問</p>
<p>「你自己看就知道，公事。」庶務員擺着鄙屑的不耐煩的表情，好像十分不願意跟對方說話，雖然論地位他比姓李的要低一級，而此刻他的傲慢態度亦是平時所不常見的。這使姓李的更加納罕了。</p>
<p>「公事？」姓季的遲疑地楞了庶務員一眼，才又遲疑地抓過信拆開來讀。頓然他的神色綳了下來，彷彿一個罪犯讀了死刑判决書，那麼絕望而慘白起來</p>
<p>「是一封裁員的公事啊！」被裁的除了他自己之外，還有其他的同事兩人。他的指尖顫抖着。呆呆地對着它發楞，可是他仍然有點不相信一樣，下意識地再將信不出聲的唸了一遍。並沒錯，李浩然——他的姓名，三個字刺目地閃耀在眼底，傾刻變成三支捶子般直撞襲着他的腦袋，更像一只可怕的槍口，一個獰猙的惡魔，嚇落了他的膽子，撕破了他的一切冀望，他的前面完全黑　了，差點沒昏過去。</p>
<p>「怎麼啦，看够了末，別人還要看的，」庶務員故意提高了的嗓子，才使他竭力把迷糊的神志鎭定着。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>「可惡！」姓李的望着走開去的庶務員的後影，咬着牙根在心裏狠狠地罵。「三十塊錢一月的飯碗頭就這樣無緣無故地砸碎了，」接着他低低的太息了一陣。</p>
<p>從這刻起，他便和這裏的一切脫離關係了，他忿忿然摔掉了那支三個月，一天十個鐘頭不停地使用着的筆，想站起來，馬上走出去，是的他沒有資格，並且也不許容他再在這室內逗留一分鐘甚至一秒鐘了。多逗留一分鐘或一秒鐘他會感到增加一些侮辱與難堪。雖然事實上不致立卽有人來干涉或趕他。但他覺得無論如何需耍馬上就離開。可是不知怎樣，他的腿子忽的痙攣了，簡直連走數步路的力氣都消失，屁股像被黏性的東西緊緊地黏貼在坐椅上，怎亦掙不脫。</p>
<p>更使　敏捷地意識到的是，十多個同事都似乎明白了在這短促的時間內，他所遭受的不幸劇變的命運，而於是有十幾張幸災樂禍的臉，二十幾隻突然成為很陰的臉，冷酷的眼睛，箭鏃似的，一齊飛射在他全身，穿痛了他底心，戳破了他的胸膛。他差不多沒有勇氣抬起頭來瞧瞧週遭的同事們，不，現在是對立的仇敵者的面龐了。</p>
<p>「人類是慘毒的，絕無同情的」他又在心裏邊暗暗、詛咒着。</p>
<p>辦公室裏照舊是靜悄悄地，祇有他獨自在聽着精神上的均衡。緩緩崩潰的聲音。</p>
<p>窗外已全黑了下去。屋子裏因為有火爐，溫度很高，並不冷。然而他渾身老是戰慄着，每條血管的血液似冰一樣在無形凝結。</p>
<p>五點鐘敲過了。同事們都散去，屋子裏空洞洞的，只掉下了他一個人，聽差開始在打掃地板和修齊桌上的雜亂東西。他自己完全不能追憶到底在怎樣一種情形之下走到樓上的臥室中來。</p>
<p>在夜裏邊他的心境更加黯淡了。</p>
<p>「老李，你不必這樣頹喪，三十塊錢的差事算什麼。」</p>
<p>一個同住的同事安慰他似的說着。老李祇面色蒼白，失神地瞧着合他心境一般黯淡的電燈半天不開口，別人的話，不管如何出於良善或熱情，而在他現在聽來，總以為是有意的挖苦，以及奚落。</p>
<p>「已經失業了，縱使眞是同情的話又有烏用呢？」他想。</p>
<p>方臉孔的庶務員走進來了，命令樣向着他：</p>
<p>「喂，主任剛才說，最好你今天便搬出去，因為明天有人要搬來的。」往日李先生的稱呼取消了。</p>
<p>「難道明天搬就不成，呃，今天不搬將怎樣。）他着實冒火了。鼓着多大的勇氣說着。</p>
<p>「總是自動些好，等到人來曉舌已是沒趣的了。」</p>
<p>庶務員臉並不面對他，自管邊說邊跨出去。</p>
<p>他沉重地嘆息了一下，眼角濕淫淫地有兩泓淸水在逡巡，快滴在腮頰上。</p>
<h3 id="c207">好花林 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 米山</p>
<p>我們底住處不多遠，就是一片樹林。凡是曾經坐過葉綠河底船隻，而又經過我們住處的人們，沒有不知道我們這片樹林的。那些旅客們站在船頭上向四周閑眺的時侯，時常地發出驚愕的聲音，尤其是在春天，樹林成了花簇了，那些旅客更會大聲呌着：「好花，好花！」如果不是隔著河水，他就想跑過去了。——有一次，一個人差一點沒有失足落水呢。</p>
<p>這些樹大半都是花菓樹，三月桃花開了，四月杏花開了，五月梨花開了，整個的春天，空氣里飄蕩著花香，所以許多打山東往西北去的人們——他們每當春荒來的時節，就成羣結隊的往西北去，每决總要經過這里，大家沒有什麼名稱呌這樹林，只嘆息這里的花好，所以便呌這片樹林「好花林」。</p>
<p>好花林給旅客非常的誘惑，——許多人想留在這里生活。　在以前，留下的還很多呢。他們有的很會治理樹木，以致這里的花更好，菓食更美了，每年下水的船隻，載滿了水菓去，換得沒有見過的的珍品回來。我們這里的生活除了靠打漁以外，好花林給我們以無限的帮助。</p>
<p>不但是物質上如此，我們底生活在春天也曾像花一樣燦爛的。那些像我這樣的少男少女們，全像給春天的花香灌醉了似的，當月光罩著大地，明星閃爍著快樂的眼睛的夜晚，像瘋狂了一樣，一對對的人們樓抱著，接吻著，歌唱著他們全是沸熱的血滾在心頭，充滿了血管的靑年人，在快樂里忘記了生活給他們底痛苦。不，那時還沒有什麼痛苦呢。我們底一位女性底祖先曾經說過的：「戀愛是酒一樣的東西，無論是男性也好，女性也好，喝它是有益的，它可以使人興奮，努力，勇敢，但是，沉醉在酒井里？却會被溺死呢」　我們靑年人就信這句話。</p>
<p>但是，葉綠河是魔鬼一樣的瘋在的，他咆哮著，或者漲大了自己底肚皮，使得茫茫的大野全是他底領域，我們底用血汗堆積成的房舍，和我們兄弟般友愛的牛，羊，……都給他黃泥的翅膀捲走了。</p>
<p>這好花林也被他們捲走了。</p>
<p>那正是一個春天，桃花開得緋紅的時候，許多年靑人高興地喚著他底伴侶說：「桃花像你底面頰樣鮮紅啦」！然而，河水暴發了，沒邊沒涯的水，漂走了我們底一切，自然也漂走了桃花！</p>
<p>我們坐著船逃荒，受盡了千辛萬苦以後，河水歸了槽，我們又回來了，重新建造我們簡單的房舍，繼續我們底日子，然而，我們再也沒有那一片可愛的樹林子了。根據我們底經騐，必須四年以後，才能恢復一個小林子。</p>
<p>這林子的消失，好像象徵著我們底生活一樣：　我們沒有燦爛的日子了。不但是老年人都悲苦地嘆著氣，就是年靑人也這樣了。—他們沒有了春天的熱愛的寄托了。</p>
<p>我們還以為那些旅客們此我們好呢。但是，他們吿訴我們：「西北也不行啦，懂嗎？——不說別的，孩子賈都賈不出去了」！抽著粗管的旱烟袋，他們好像要哭泣的樣子。……</p>
<p>有些人就開始種植樹木，預備恢復往日可觀的樣子，——那燦爛的春天，春的象徵，然而，一些人時常地唱著一隻小曲，說：「好花林是幸福所，恢復他是太難囉」！（葉綠河上的故事之三）</p>

<p>The Central Government Will Have a Clear Decision on Transitional Measures; The President's Power to Issue Emergency Orders Is in Chapter Four</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ye Chucang has gone to Shanghai to meet with Wang Chonghui, Dai Chuanxian, and others to continue exchanging views on the draft constitution. He is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the evening of the 16th. On the 16th, Chuan Bingchang invited Tao Lüqian, Lin Bin, and others to study the transitional clauses in the constitutions of various countries and the legislative precedents for granting the president the power to issue emergency orders. According to the draft constitution currently under review by the Central Government, matters originally stipulated in the constitution that require separate implementation procedures will be determined by law. Now that the Central Government will accept the proposal from all parties to explicitly stipulate transitional clauses in the constitution, the Central Government should make a clear decision on what should be determined by transitional measures and how these transitional measures should be handled from a legislative technical perspective. As for the legislative precedents in various countries for granting the president the power to issue emergency orders, many countries, such as the United States and France, either temporarily authorize the president by Congress or the president only has this power during Congress recess. If our country's constitution stipulates that the president also has the power to issue emergency orders, it will be stipulated in the presidential section of Chapter Four on the Central Government.

Currently, unscrupulous merchants in various places are relying on special forces to protect them, making it safe and profitable.

<p>With Four Conditions Attached, Replied to the Provincial Government</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) The Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Banking Industry Association, and the Hangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce, four organizations, were entrusted by the provincial government's deletion of the draft telegram regarding the reorganization of provincial debt. They recounted the difficult situation they had been through, requesting understanding and agreement. They held a joint meeting at the Banking Association at 10 a.m. on the 16th. Chairman Xu Xinggong resolved that the original resolution of the joint meeting was intended to understand the difficult situation faced by the government and to take into account the legitimate interests of creditors. Now that they have been instructed again by the provincial government to understand, they must reluctantly make sacrifices again due to the current national crisis and accept the proposed reorganization plan under the following conditions: The method of reducing interest rates for the old public debt listed in this revised reorganization plan, which is given the same treatment as other public debts with interest rates in the same industry, is unfair. The provincial government should make appropriate revisions, or find other remedies to adjust. It is inevitable that the original listed funds will have temporary shortfalls. The provincial government should find other special income as much as possible to supplement them, so as to avoid the risk of insufficient income in case of accidents. After this reorganization, the organization of the fund management committee should be further tightened, and the principle should be that the association directly withdraws the funds and must not be arbitrarily diverted, so as to consolidate and protect them. The second item stated in the above resolution, that the new public debt regulations must include explicit provisions that can be used as various guarantees and bank reserves, should be strongly advocated by the provincial government to achieve the goal, so as to increase the efficiency of provincial debt use and maintain financial circulation. They jointly replied to the provincial government by telegram. The Director of the Department of Finance visited financial leaders today to mediate, expressing that most can be accepted, and a part will be personally submitted to the central government in Nanjing for instructions.

<h3 id="e28">The Indian National Movement After the All-India Congress <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>It has been a long time since we have heard news about the Indian national liberation movement. However, the liberation movement of the oppressed Indian people striving for independence and freedom is still actively underway in secret, and its momentum has not ceased but has seen astonishing development. The recent passage of many extremely important resolutions by the All-India Congress is a clear example. The All-India Congress is an important guiding body for the Indian national liberation movement, composed of people from all walks of life. Figures such as Gandhi and Nehru are important figures within it. Although its internal elements are somewhat complex, it has played an extremely important role in the past history of the Indian national independence movement. This congress was convened in Lucknow and lasted for several days, finally closing late on the 14th. More than ten important resolutions were passed, the most important of which were opposition to the new Indian constitution promulgated by the British government last year and non-participation in imperialist wars. From these two points, we can know the future trend of the Indian national liberation movement, which I will describe separately below.</p>
<p>The new Indian constitution was passed by the British Parliament last summer. This is the result of years of Indian national independence movement. Because British imperialism, in view of the rising Indian national independence movement, drafted this new constitution to allow Indians a small part of self-government in order to ease the forces of revolution. The main content of the new constitution is to allow the 350 million people of India to enjoy self-government. The central and provincial governments are organized, and their cabinet members are responsible to the legislature. National defense, diplomacy, and religious affairs are presided over by the governor-general. As for other matters that do not hinder the maintenance of public security and the special responsibilities of protecting the interests of minorities and financial stability, they are handled by the governor-general and provincial governors according to the cabinet members' opinions. From this provision, it can be seen that important powers of the Indian government, such as diplomacy and military affairs, are still in the hands of the British Empire, and what the Indian people have obtained are only some unimportant powers. Even the demands of moderate independence factions in India for autonomous colonial status have not been met. It is natural that it is not supported by those who advocate complete independence. However, some higher-class Indians have already shown a tendency to accept this kind of constitution. Even in the All-India Congress, which is tasked with leading the independence movement, some people have expressed their support and advocated acceptance. However, in this All-India Congress in Lucknow, the opposition's views have won. Chairman Nehru clearly pointed out that this new constitution is a new charter of slavery, aiming to consolidate the British Empire's ruling power and restrain it. However, the implementation of this new constitution has been decided and cannot be overthrown. Therefore, Nehru advised the people of the All-India Congress to use the new constitution to seize legislative power and use this legislative power to create a political stalemate through economic procedures. Now, from the All-India Congress's attitude towards this new constitution, we can know that the Indian national independence movement will never be eased by the British Empire's policy of division. On the contrary, it is likely to become even more intensified, because what the Indian masses demand is the complete independence of the Indian nation and to break away from the shackles of the British Empire.</p>
<p>Secondly, the All-India Congress resolved not to participate in imperialist wars, which also has a significant relationship to the future of Indian national liberation. We know that in the last world war, the Indian people, deceived by the slogan of "national self-determination," sacrificed a great deal for Britain. However, the goal of independence was still not achieved. Now, the crisis of war is increasingly imminent, and Britain will inevitably use the Indian people as sacrifices again. However, the Indian people have learned a great lesson and will not be fooled again. Therefore, this congress has decided not to participate in imperialist wars. This resolution, on the one hand, certainly contains anti-British significance and wants to liberate itself from its shackles. On the other hand, it shows that India is unwilling to participate in imperialist wars and wants to prepare to unite with weak nations to launch anti-imperialist wars.</p>
<p>Although the resolutions of this All-India Congress are not many, they all contain extremely important significance. In the future, the Indian national independence movement will inevitably embark on a more correct path and have more astonishing development. That is what we can see.</p>

<p>(Washington) Both China and the United States solemnly declared today that the talks between Finance Minister H.H. Kung and the delegation from the Chinese banking community, led by Chen Guangfu, are currently limited to general issues. The public should not have excessive expectations for any outcome. This statement was issued in response to rumors circulating in the Far East and various silver markets, claiming that China and the United States had agreed on silver prices and detailed plans for developing the Chinese economy, and that the delegation had requested loans from New York banks and the US Treasury Department for China. According to sources in the United States, the most practical assistance China hopes to obtain from these talks is, at most, a US commitment to purchase a large amount of Chinese silver. However, no concrete resolutions have been made so far. The Associated Press also learned that Ku Yi-chun of the delegation had generally discussed ways to expand Chinese exports to the United States, such as tea, silk, and oil, but without result. Ku has now gone to New York. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>

<p>(London) The weather is now improving, and the British ship "Ranpura" has a good chance of getting out of danger. This morning, the ship began unloading cargo and luggage onto tugboats alongside it. After the "Ranpura" ran aground, fierce winds and raging waves made it impossible to load and unload cargo. Now the wind and waves have finally subsided somewhat, allowing the work of reducing the ship's load to proceed. (Reuters Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Education received a telegram from Tang Xifen on the 15th, stating that our antiquities are safe and that the "Ranpura" is sailing. The Ministry of Education telegraphed the consulate in Marseille and Zheng Tianxi and Tang Xifen on the morning of the 16th, instructing them to carefully inspect the ship when it arrives in Marseille to determine whether the antiquities should continue to be transported on the original ship. At the same time, this intention was telegraphed to the embassy in the United Kingdom to consult with the British government. Minister of Education Wang issued two telegrams on the 15th, one to our ambassador to the United Kingdom, Guo Taiqi, inquiring about the details of the accident, and one to our consulate in Marseille, Chen Zhongjun, asking him to go to the scene of the accident to investigate the truth and report back by telegram.</p>
<p>Ma Heng, Director of the Palace Museum, said that the antiquities from our country participating in the British art exhibition totaled 91 boxes, of which 70% belonged to the Palace Museum. The rest were from the Henan Antiquities Exhibition Hall, the Anhui Library, the Academia Sinica, and jade artifacts from Shanghai collector Zhang Naiji. The Palace Museum's collection included paintings and calligraphy from the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, bronzes from the Shang and Zhou dynasties, porcelain from the Song dynasty and later, carved lacquer from the Ming and Qing dynasties, and imperial palace thrones, totaling 735 pieces. At the time, for the sake of caution, they were not the essence of the Palace Museum, and many valuable items were not selected. It is said that the grounding of this commercial ship is not dangerous. (Central News Agency Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar After running aground off the coast here, the British company's ship "Ranpura" has not yet been rescued. Although naval tugboats were engaged in towing yesterday, they failed to make it float. However, efforts have been made to prevent the "Ranpura" from sinking into the sand. The ballast and fuel in the ship have been removed, but the ship has not yet floated. The wind is quite strong, hindering the work of the tugboats. It is hoped that the weather will improve and the ship can be rescued. The British company's "Parapool" carried 40 passengers from the "Ranpura" to Marseille last night. (Reuters Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>Port of Gibraltar Two giant tugboats sailed to the location where the "Ranpura" ran aground this afternoon to help tow it in order to get it out of danger. After several hours, it was still ineffective. At this time, the wind and waves had calmed down slightly, and most of the passengers on the "Ranpura" were able to disembark. However, because the local hotels were full, they had to return to the ship. The British Mail Ship Company has sent several experts by plane to inspect the rescue situation, and they are expected to arrive tomorrow. (Havas Telegram, 15th)</p>

<p>Palo Alto, USA Former President Hoover directly responded to President Roosevelt's campaign speech on Monday night, fiercely attacking the President's plan to solve the unemployment problem. Hoover said that what President Roosevelt advocates is still an unemployment relief plan, which has already proven to be a failure. Now, Roosevelt still advocates shortening working hours without reducing wages, which is tantamount to placing himself in a dilemma. What Hoover suggested was that the government reduce expenses, balance the budget, mint real currency, and stop the panic of expansion and other activities that destroy future credit. Hoover believes that by proceeding in this way, the United States can restore long-term confidence, obtain long-term investment, and generate new businesses and new jobs. The Republican Party has always advocated the restoration of basic industries as a necessary condition for solving the unemployment problem. This point is opposed by President Roosevelt. Today, Hoover still asked, "Why not increase jobs instead of sharing existing jobs?" (National Telegram, 15th)</p>

<p>Organizing a Committee to Resolve Border Disputes, No Longer Opposing the Exchange of Diplomatic Representatives</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to today's bulletin here, Outer Mongolia has accepted the "Manchukuo" proposal of April 5 with reservations, and has begun to resolve disputes between the two sides within Outer Mongolia. Outer Mongolia agrees to exchange diplomatic representatives with "Manchukuo," "but the diplomatic personnel sent by Manchukuo must not go deep into the interior of Outer Mongolia." As of the date, "Manchukuo" has not yet responded. It is found that the proposal made by "Manchukuo" includes two articles: organizing a border committee, delineating boundaries and investigating conflicts, and sending diplomatic representatives to be stationed in the capitals of the two countries. Outer Mongolia previously firmly opposed the exchange of diplomatic representatives, which was one of the main reasons for the breakdown of the Manzhouli conference last year.

As for Belgium, for domestic political reasons, it would rather be assisted by Britain than rely on France, and therefore insists that in the event of an emergency, Britain must fully assist it and the Netherlands. However, most of the British army is currently concentrated in Egypt to protect its territory there or, if necessary, to go to northern India to strengthen its defenses. Therefore, the number of deployable forces is insignificant. As for the British fleet, most of it is still stationed in the Mediterranean. Although this fleet can be quickly recalled to the country when necessary, the North Sea may be attacked unexpectedly. As for the British Air Force, its newest aircraft have been transferred to Egypt. In addition, although there are still some excellent aircraft that can be deployed, they are still insufficient. In short, the strength of the British navy, army, and air force is weak. Therefore, the general staff of the country is difficult to supply the information requested by France and Belgium in full. (Havas Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) Representatives of the British, French, and Belgian general staffs held group talks in the three departments of the navy, army, and air force at 3 pm today. As far as the general public knows, there are two main purposes of this talk: (1) Strategic cooperation methods among the three countries should be formulated so that they can be implemented in the event of unprovoked aggression. (2) The number of naval, army, and air force forces that Britain can deploy to assist the invaded country should be determined, especially the navy and air force, because in the army, the number of troops Britain dispatches is estimated to be only one or two divisions. Of the above two issues, the second is likely to cause difficulties. According to the expectations of the delegations of the three countries, the staff talks will continue for a week. Once the talks in the navy, army, and air force groups have yielded results, a plenary meeting will be convened to connect them. (Havas Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Representatives of the British, French, and Belgian general staffs held group talks this morning and are scheduled to hold a plenary meeting at the Admiralty this afternoon. The general public is quite pessimistic about the situation of the meeting, because the Belgian representatives, for domestic political reasons, insist that they must be fully assisted by Britain and do not want to rely on France. The major difficulty arises from this. It is reported that Belgium's reason for this move is that the Flemish people of the country do not want to rely solely on French assistance or to take French assistance as the mainstay in ensuring the country's safety. The Flemish people recently requested that the military alliance agreement previously signed between France and Belgium in 1920 be abolished. (Havas Telegram, 16th)</p>

<p>(London) Lansbury, the leader of the Labor Party in the House of Commons, who resigned due to his strong pacifist views, has set off for the United States today to promote peace. Lansbury is 77 years old, but he is still healthy and his enthusiasm has not diminished compared to his youth. When he set off today, many people came to see him off. This trip was at the invitation of several churches and other organizations in the United States, and Lansbury also firmly believes that now is a good opportunity to awaken the public to support world peace. Lansbury will lecture on pacifism in the eastern states of the United States, and Shalt, a member of the Labor Party in Congress who is traveling with him, will lecture on the same issue in the western states. Lansbury is currently scheduled to give 16 lectures in various places. If he has spare time, he plans to go to Canada to lecture in Toronto, and will return to the country by ship from New York on June 28. (Reuters Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e36">American Peace Conference: The US Plan Contains Four Points <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The US government's plan to be submitted to the preparatory committee for the Pan-American Peace Conference has four key points, one of which is that when war breaks out in Europe, the American countries should unanimously maintain neutrality. Regarding this, American experts are currently drafting a plan, which is said to be based on the current US Neutrality Act, so that American countries, whether they are members of the League of Nations or non-members, can adopt it. The diplomatic authorities of the Latin American republics (most of which are members of the League of Nations) believe that the current US Neutrality Act prohibits the export of arms to all warring countries, which is contrary to the sanctions policy of the League of Nations (the League of Nations advocates sanctions against aggressor countries and is against the invaded countries), but the United States believes that the Latin American republics' sanctions policy of the League of Nations may be further advanced, treating all warring countries equally, and saying that the embargo is limited to arms, and various raw materials are not included. The Latin American countries have no need to worry about it. (Havas Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>Baltimore, USA Secretary of State Welles recently delivered a speech at a banquet of the Maryland Federation of Women's Clubs, in which he discussed the Pan-American Peace Conference, saying that the conference hopes to establish a permanent security system to protect the peace of North and South America, and unanimously maintain neutrality in the event of war in Europe. It is also hoped that the tariff barriers between North and South American countries can be reduced. Although these are personal opinions, President Roosevelt's views are probably the same. The cultural and natural relations between North and South American countries must be close, and the degree of mutual understanding among the youth of the countries should be improved. Finally, he said that all the experiences since the end of the European War are not enough to consolidate peace. "This is an unprecedented opportunity for us American countries to establish a more appropriate system to protect peace," he said. (Havas Telegram, 15th)</p>

<p>Hindenburg Allowed to Stop at US Airfield, German-Made Vessels to be Used as Floating Seaplane Stations</p>
<p>(Washington) The US Navy Department has approved the German airship "Hindenburg I" to use the Lakehurst Airfield in New Jersey for a period of six months, so the "Hindenburg" can make several flights between Germany and the United States to test whether a scheduled air service across the North Atlantic can be established. For each flight, US Navy Department member Baker will travel with the ship. Germany has been operating a scheduled air service across the South Atlantic with the Graf Zeppelin for a long time. Germany is the only country in the world to maintain this type of business in this area. Now, Germany is planning to expand its business to the North Atlantic. (Reuters Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Germany and the United States signed an aviation agreement in February this year, stipulating that scheduled aviation services will be held between the two countries, and both parties may set up specially made vessels in the Atlantic Ocean as floating stations for aircraft to take off and land. Germany has already built one such vessel, named the "Ostmark," which was launched in Kiel Harbor and will soon sail to the waters off Africa to moor. The ship is 74 meters long and has a displacement of 2,000 tons. The top deck is equipped with a special aircraft launching machine, and the stern is equipped with a giant crane for hoisting aircraft. The ship has two diesel engines, each with 900 horsepower, and a speed of 15 nautical miles per hour. (Havas Telegram, 15th)</p>

<p>Peace on the Condition of Security and Glory</p>
<p>(Paris) The Federation of Provincial Journalists held a banquet tonight, and Premier Sarraut was invited to attend. He gave a broadcast speech on the diplomatic situation, saying, "France needs peace, which is a common aspiration. However, this so-called peace is a peace of security and glory. The pillars of the peace mechanism, the strongest and simplest, are none other than the equal rights that must be obtained among countries, international treaties that must be freely concluded, guaranteed by a system of mutual assistance, and the dignity of treaties that must be determined, thereby reducing the burden of international armament and military preparations. If the peace mechanism can take these three as its pillars, then all nations with sincerity, regardless of strength, can be sheltered by it without fear of aggression. France has generously abandoned the huge reparations owed by Germany after the European War and the guarantee measures given to France by the Treaty of Versailles, in order to use this as a shortcut to reach the path of peace. We have spared no effort to pursue peace, thinking more for others than for ourselves, and even for the former enemy countries, we do not hesitate to seek peace on their behalf. France has always been broad-minded, and now it is loyal to the League of Nations, abiding by it unchanged, also with this mentality. Is it that France, which has repeatedly been disappointed in the past, will now fall into extreme dismay, so that it will no longer rely on the organization of an ideal collective peace, which it has always believed in, and finally betray the League of Nations? Under these circumstances, where some nations are only seeking their own interests, and the will of other nations is volatile and full of absurdities, France, which formerly had hopes for an international system based on mutual assistance and solidarity, will now throw them into vain, and only seek its own security? We raise this question, and we are not without worry and fear in our hearts, but this is not for ourselves. On the contrary, there are some nations whose strength of self-defense is far inferior to ours, and they cannot cope with future aggression. The security of their country depends only on collective and unanimous action. For such nations, we should be worried. We have exhausted our wisdom and used all opportunities to promote the spirit of international rule of law. Now that the Locarno Treaty has been suddenly abolished, international disputes have arisen. In order to peacefully resolve these disputes, we are still patient and exhaust our intelligence, using all opportunities to do so. Regarding this, the world has its own public opinion. At the present time, we have never been unable to take oppressive measures immediately in the military, but the reason why we do not do so is nothing more than to protect peace, and to look ahead and behind, thinking that all issues must be resolved by law. Sarraut then mentioned the domestic discussions, many of which asked whether France's strength could resist Germany, saying, "I dare to assure you that our country's navy, army, and air force are now ready, and they will be able to fully perform their duties. I have had long meetings with the heads of the navy, army, and air force and experts, and I would not dare to say this with certainty if I did not know the truth," and so on.

<p>(London) Nurse Harding was accused of murdering Ms. Baglay. On February 26th, she was found guilty and sentenced to be hanged. She was executed in Birmingham today. It is noted that this is the first woman to be hanged in Britain this century. The condemned had five children, the youngest being only six months old. Initially, she was accused of conspiring with her companion, Mr. Sullivan, but Sullivan was found not guilty and acquitted. The jurors at the time unanimously ruled that Ms. Baglay died from morphine or heroin poisoning, and it must have been the result of a conspiracy. The coroner stated that in Ms. Baglay's will, she left all her assets, 1,600 pounds, to the defendant after her death, as compensation for her care. The defendant must have wanted to obtain this money quickly and devised a malicious scheme. The jurors requested clemency, but it was not approved by the relevant authorities, so she could not escape the death penalty. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Madrid Premier Azaña recently delivered a policy address to the House of Representatives, stating briefly, "The cabinet's program is none other than the program advocated by the left-wing Popular Front during the election campaign, which is known to the world. Among them, economic issues are particularly emphasized by the cabinet. Agricultural resources must be developed, but it should be based on the development of land reform laws." (Note: Most of Spain's land is owned by nobles. The House of Representatives passed the Land Reform Law on July 27th of last year, stipulating that agricultural workers can purchase small properties, which is a new policy of equal land rights benefiting farmers.) "In addition, large-scale public works should be carried out to solve the unemployment problem and reorganize the farmers' credit system to help the rural areas," he said. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Madrid After Premier Azaña delivered his policy address to the House of Representatives yesterday, the left-wing Socialist and Communist Party members were extremely disappointed. These people believed that since the re-election of the House of Representatives, incidents of disrupting public order have occurred repeatedly. The reason for this is that it was instigated by right-wing individuals. The Premier should have criticized these people, but he did not mention them at all, which is inappropriate. The general public believes that when the House votes today, the current cabinet will receive the support of a majority of the members. Although the Socialist and Communist Parties have complained, they will still vote in favor. The left-wing Republican Party and the Republican Center-Right Coalition Party are the pillars of the current cabinet, and they will definitely vote in favor unanimously. As for the right-wing and central parties, they did not obstruct the cabinet when it announced its policy address yesterday. Some of their members will also vote in favor, and the majority of the other members will only abstain from voting. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Italian government has put forward peace conditions: Peace negotiations must be conducted directly between Italy and Ethiopia, with Italy being the victor and Ethiopia being the defeated country. It is heard that the Italian chief delegate, Mr. Aloisi, stated this point when he met with Mr. Madariaga yesterday morning. Italy has repeatedly stated that the League of Nations cannot intervene in any peace negotiations between the two belligerent countries. The League of Nations can only send an observer to be present. It is also heard that Mr. Aloisi also told Mr. Madariaga that Italy is now willing to negotiate according to these conditions. At the same time, the meeting of the Committee of Thirteen has been extended to 6 p.m. today. This morning, the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Mr. Avenol, accompanied Mr. Madariaga and Mr. Aloisi for talks. At noon, the British Foreign Secretary Eden and the French Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Poncet, had lunch with Mr. Madariaga. After the meal, the postponement of the meeting of the Committee of Thirteen was announced. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Many believe that the negotiations of the Committee of Thirteen to reconcile the Italian-Ethiopian dispute will fail. The Chairman of the Committee of Thirteen, Mr. Madariaga, and the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Mr. Avenol, began peace talks with the Italian representative, Mr. Aloisi, for one hour yesterday, but the situation remains chaotic and urgent. Mr. Madariaga and Mr. Aloisi resumed talks in the evening, but still did not achieve any substantial results. It is heard that Mr. Boncour stated that he came to Geneva to discuss the possibility of peace negotiations, but he has not received government instructions regarding the basis of such negotiations. Now, he only wants to discuss the formalities. As for a ceasefire, it cannot be discussed because the government has not given instructions on this matter. Mr. Madariaga and Mr. Aloisi will meet again at 11:45 a.m. this morning, but the attitude of the Italian chief delegate has not changed at all. Therefore, when the Committee of Thirteen meets this afternoon, Mr. Madariaga will obviously not be able to report any satisfactory news to the meeting. Many believe that the Committee of Thirteen may wait quietly for 24 hours to see if the talks will be effective. If they are still ineffective, it will announce that its reconciliation efforts have failed and will listen to the League of Nations as a committee to resolve the issue. The various parties of the League of Nations have very serious views on the possibilities of the overall situation, and they feel that what needs to be discussed now is not only the issue of maintaining the existing sanctions against Italy, but also to continue to formulate a more severe plan against Italy. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Ethiopian government has firmly rejected the peace conditions put forward by the Italian government. It is heard that the Italian side is suggesting not to include a ceasefire. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to a semi-official statement, Italy has now decided to first occupy the capital of Ethiopia and then begin genuine peace negotiations. This determination is the basis of Italy's attitude towards the peace talks. It is speculated that the Ethiopian capital may fall on the 21st of this month (the founding day of Rome). If the capital has not fallen by then, the date will be delayed. It does not want to take diplomatic constraints, nor does it intend to announce a break with the League of Nations. As for the future peace terms, the semi-official side said that Italy still supports direct negotiations between Italy and Ethiopia in order to agree on a plan to protect the interests of various European countries in Ethiopia, which can also be accepted by the League of Nations. On the contrary, if the League of Nations intervenes in the peace talks, it is feared that there will be no real peace guarantee after the ceasefire, which Italy does not want to see. As for the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant, Italy will naturally abide by it. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Italian representative, Mr. Aloisi, held talks with the Chairman of the Committee of Thirteen of the Council of the League of Nations, Mr. Madariaga, this morning, which ended at 12:15 p.m. According to our correspondent, Mr. Aloisi put forward two conditions for the start of peace negotiations between Italy and Ethiopia: 1. The war in East Africa does not need to be stopped during the negotiation period. 2. The negotiations should be conducted directly between the two parties, Italy and Ethiopia, without the participation of the League of Nations. Only after the two parties reach an agreement, it should be submitted to the League of Nations for approval, so as to become a formal agreement. After the end of the talks, Mr. Madariaga invited the French Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Poncet, the British Foreign Secretary Eden, and the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Mr. Avenol, to lunch to discuss the meeting of the Committee of Thirteen in the afternoon and decided to convene a meeting of representatives of the member states at 6 p.m. to report on the results of his talks with the representatives of the two parties and the views of the two parties on the peace issue. It is heard that the Ethiopian Emperor has always entrusted his fate to the hands of the League of Nations. Even though he is at a critical moment of survival, his views have not changed. He will still invoke the League of Nations Covenant and use the resolutions passed by the League of Nations on the Italian-Ethiopian dispute as the basis. When the Committee of Thirteen meets in the afternoon, it will naturally decide on a procedure to meet the wishes of the two parties and the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Mr. Aloisi, the Chief Secretary of the Office of the Italian Prime Minister, arrived here at 4:40 p.m. with Mr. Rocco, the Director of the League of Nations Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Massia, the Director of the Information Department. He began talks with Mr. Madariaga, the Chairman of the Committee of Thirteen, at 6:10 p.m. The Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Mr. Avenol, was also present. The meeting lasted for one hour. Afterwards, Mr. Madariaga did not want to disclose the contents of the talks because the matters discussed were important. The second talk has now been scheduled for 11:45 a.m. tomorrow. A press release will be issued after the talks. Therefore, the League of Nations side speculates that, at least for the current situation, tomorrow's talks will be the last one. According to Italian semi-official sources, Mr. Aloisi's visit is purely exploratory. Therefore, what can be discussed at this time is only the issue of the extent of future peace negotiations. Even Mr. Aloisi's associates said that Italy cannot propose peace conditions at this time, and Mr. Aloisi himself is not the plenipotentiary representative of Italy for peace negotiations. The League of Nations personnel believe that what Mr. Madariaga and Mr. Aloisi are currently discussing are more far-reaching and substantial issues, not just the procedural issues of future negotiations. Also, according to some sources, the tense situation between Britain and Italy has recently eased significantly. This statement has been denied by the Italian delegation. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations' Committee of Thirteen, originally scheduled to meet at 4 p.m. today, has been changed to 6 p.m. at the request of British Foreign Secretary Eden.

<p>(Rome) According to embassy sources today, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will insist on demanding that the League of Nations abolish sanctions as a prerequisite for peace talks with Ethiopia. Mussolini has instructed Italy's chief delegate to the League of Nations, Mr. Aloisi, to inform the Committee of Thirteen of this intention. It is also learned that Mussolini believes that the war in Ethiopia is almost over, so he decided to notify the League of Nations of the peace conditions instead of directly notifying Ethiopia. As for the rumors that Mussolini had demanded that the withdrawal of the British Mediterranean Fleet must be a condition before discussing peace terms, the official here today denied this. Diplomatic circles indicated that Italy will be able to occupy the Ethiopian capital before the end of the month. The only obstacle now is General Nasibu's army, whose headquarters are located in Jijiga. Generally, the Italian army will encircle it next week. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Rome) After the army decided to occupy Qabri Dahar, the aerial distance to the Ethiopian capital is only 145 miles. Commander-in-Chief Badoglio's troops have now controlled all camel routes from the Ethiopian capital to the northwest and development areas of Ethiopia. All areas from the eastern front to Lake Haromaya are under the control of the Italian army. Since October 1st of last year, the Italian army has advanced 150 miles from the Eritrean border. Currently, if calculated by road distance, it is only 170 miles from the Ethiopian capital. Reliable sources believe today that Badoglio will order several air force teams to fly to Qabri Dahar. Once General Graziani's southern army defeats General Nasibu's army on the Harar-Jijiga line, they can fly to the Ethiopian capital. The Italian army's future actions will likely connect the troops in Qabri Dahar with the troops in Gondar and the Lake Tana area. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Mussolini today again summoned the youths of the 1915 class to join the military service, totaling 200,000 people. Therefore, Italy's active soldiers now number 1,250,000, of whom 350,000 are currently expeditioning in Ethiopia. Mussolini's conscription of this group of youths shows that he has no room for compromise with Ethiopia, even if Britain and the League of Nations intervene forcefully, he will not hesitate. According to reliable sources, Mussolini deeply feels that Italy's current military strength is sufficient to cope with Britain's sudden change of attitude. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e45">Achievements of League of Nations Sanctions: Italian Trade Decreases by One-Third, Britain Suffers the Greatest Sacrifice <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) According to the first official report on the impact of the League of Nations sanctions against Italy, Italy and its colonies' trade with the 47 countries implementing sanctions has decreased by one-third. This total was compiled by the League of Nations Economic Intelligence Service at the request of the Committee of Eighteen. It is limited to the achievements of the first four months of the implementation of sanctions. It states that Italian exports have decreased from US$68 million to US$45 million, and imports have decreased from US$73 million to US$64 million. In addition, Italy has lost US$63 million in gold reserves. These figures show that Britain has made the greatest sacrifice among the League of Nations countries in fulfilling its obligations. On average, the League of Nations countries have lost 44% of their export trade to Italy due to fulfilling their covenant, while Britain alone has lost 92%. In February 1935, Britain shipped goods to Italy worth US$18,417,000, while only US$82,100 was shipped last month. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chairman of the Economic Sanctions Committee today distributed a 15-page memorandum to the member states of the League of Nations, detailing the impact of economic sanctions on trade. The statistics, from November of last year to January of this year, are all based on the gold standard. This official document was published one day before the meeting of the Committee of Thirteen, and its meaning is even more important. The Chairman of the Economic Sanctions Committee stated in the attached letter that if necessary, the Committee of Eighteen will be convened for a meeting as soon as possible to discuss.</p>
<p>The memorandum pointed out that Italian exports to Britain, since the implementation of sanctions (November 1935 to January 1936), have decreased from US$2,800,000 to US$700,000; exports to France have decreased from US$2,200,000 to US$160,000; exports to the United States have decreased from US$3,500,000 to US$1,900,000; and exports to the Netherlands have decreased from US$180,000 to US$77,000. However, exports to Germany, Austria, and Hungary have remained almost the same. Imports have also decreased at the same time. Imports from Britain have decreased from US$850,000 to US$150,000; imports from France have decreased from US$2,900,000 to US$700,000; and imports from the United States have decreased from US$5,500,000 to US$700,000. France and Sweden are more important for gold imports. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The Standing Committee of the Soviet Government has approved the division of Moscow from ten districts to twenty-three districts. It is heard that the motive for this redrawing of district boundaries is due to the development of industry, municipal administration, and culture and construction. In recent years, Moscow has progressed extremely rapidly. Since 1930, the population has increased by one million. The latest population statistics for the city are 3,650,000 people, of whom the number of workers has doubled, totaling 600,000. It is heard that the government plans to invest 250,000 rubles in Moscow's construction projects this year. (Note: The total investment in 1911 was only 56 million rubles.) (TASS dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3 id="e50">The Food of Peking Man at Zhoukoudian (Part 1) <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Dr. Ralph W. Chaney, Translated by Chen Shaoyan</p>
<p>We can only guess at the eating habits of the earliest primitive humans. A million years ago, our human ancestors had not yet learned the art of writing, so they left behind no lists of foods or books on cooking methods that could serve as evidence of their food choices.</p>
<p>We can speculate, based on the diets of modern great apes, that they consumed both plants and animals. This omnivorous diet is also suggested by the nature of the fossil teeth of early humans. These teeth seem suitable for chewing a wide variety of foods, including both meat and plants.</p>
<p>In the early written records of humans, until recently, no concrete evidence about their food can be found. The Java Erect Ape-man (Pithecanthropus erectus) was not discovered until 1891, but all that could be represented were only a part of the skull and a few remaining bones. The historical material represented by the Early Man or Ancient Ape-man (Eoanthropus, Pildown) of Piltdown in England is also incomplete. Apart from the material provided by his teeth, no one has ever raised questions or discussions about food and eating habits.</p>
<p>This problem was not solved until the discovery of the third type of proto-human. This type of proto-human, like the aforementioned Erect Ape-man and Early Man, lived far back in the early Ice Age. In this way, it can also be said that the actual dwelling place of our earliest ancestors was discovered.</p>
<p>Members of the Geological Survey of China, under the guidance of Dr. Davidson Black, have excavated numerous skulls and teeth of the oldest proto-humans living in Asia over the past six years. Also excavated in the old home of these ancient cave dwellers were many stone tools, hearth bottoms, and uneaten food scraps. This can be regarded as the first record of the food of the oldest known humans in Asia.</p>
<p>Millions of years ago, many limestones were deposited and accumulated in shallow seas, and are now exposed in the Western Hills near the ancient capital of Beijing, China. Due to the dissolving power of underground springs, the mountains have been pierced into many caves, which have been used as dwellings by ancient Chinese proto-humans, and as underground nests by hyenas and other beasts. Some of the caves have been blocked because fragments of rock have fallen from the top and walls of the caves from time to time. These fallen fragments have gradually cemented into hard masses, commonly known as breccia, after being deposited by water containing limestone.</p>
<p>As time slowly passed, and it came to our time, Chinese workers came to the mountains to mine limestone. They were preparing to use these stone materials as building materials or as the foundation stones of roads. They encountered these irregular, angular breccia blocks, which had not been touched because of their impure texture. In 1923, the prestigious Swedish paleontologist J.G. Anderson studied these breccia blocks and discovered many fossil skeletons of extinct rhinoceroses, wild buffaloes, and other beasts in northern China. Through such hard excavation work, the oldest history of Asian humans was uncovered from these breccia blocks containing fossil skeletons!</p>
<p>Zhoukoudian Town, located thirty miles west of Peiping (Beijing), is a center for inland coal mining and limestone extraction. A railway was built there several years ago to transport those heavy products to Peiping, but due to the political instability in northern China in recent years, the vehicles used for transportation are sometimes used for war activities. As a result, long camel caravans, all Bactrian camels from inland Asia, appeared on this dusty road with heavy steps, and donkeys, often wasting time, trudged up the long slopes to the mines.</p>
<p>On the small hill above Zhoukoudian, near the cave, where the most ossified fossils are accumulated, the Geological Survey of China has built a very comfortable laboratory and residences for the scientific workers engaged in the excavation. There are often visitors from all over the world, including many famous anthropologists and paleontologists, to see the most complete record of these earliest humans. The hillside is covered with fragments of breccia removed from the cave, and the entrance to the cave is covered with rock to avoid the strong sunlight.</p>
<p>This seems to be true: in the past, there were one or more entrances and exits here, which were used as doorways by proto-humans or beasts. These cave entrances have probably collapsed and been blocked, so they may discover more important facts that are unknown now during future excavations. Going down from the limestone passages to a depth of sixty feet from the current entrance and exit, the bottom layer of the cave is reached, which is the real residence of the oldest residents of Asia! Here, it has been covered by many feet of breccia, and many skulls have been recorded. From these skulls, we know that the wisdom of these human ancestors has reached above the level of the beasts.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Resolutions of the Annual Meeting <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The first annual meeting of the Council of Academia Sinica was held on the 16th. As a result of the discussion of the proposals, the proposal by President Cai on the outline of the working policy of the Academia Sinica was resolved and passed. The case that Chinese scientific research should pay special attention to the urgent needs of the country, society, and practical method was discussed, and it was requested that the Academia Sinica negotiate with domestic research institutions to actively focus on scientific research related to national defense and production. It was resolved that A. Research work should pay special attention to the urgent needs of the country and society, including all types of science. B. The Academia Sinica should inform all its affiliated research institutes and other important academic institutions in the country to adopt this idea in the allocation of funds. C. The Council of Academia Sinica should, within the scope of each discipline, specifically list the problems that the country and society most urgently need to solve, estimating that considerable results can be achieved in two or three years, and send them to the Academia Sinica, which will then distribute them to relevant academic institutions for work. D. If government agencies have any problems that need to be researched, they can consult with the Academia Sinica on how to proceed. E. Academic institutions should report the research methods and results obtained on the above problems to the Council of Academia Sinica at any time. The proposal that the Council of Academia Sinica should make efforts to promote cooperation in domestic and foreign scientific work was resolved. A. The principle was approved. B. Preliminary review method: The council will send a letter to the embassies abroad and the student supervisors, stating that the names, subjects, and thesis titles of students who have graduated from foreign countries should be sent to the council annually, and it would be even better if the thesis could be attached. The council will send a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education, stating that all international conferences related to academic research should be notified to the council so that it can provide the government with opinions on whether China should participate in the conference. C. The council will send a letter to domestic academic institutions and organizations, stating that all information about their participation in international academic work should be reported to the council. D. Please ask the Academia Sinica to investigate and collect the organization history and past conference overviews of important international academic conferences as much as possible for reference. C. Advanced methods: Please ask the Academia Sinica to consult with the Ministry of Education to evaluate. The proposal to consult with various research institutions to open up research rooms and libraries to encourage scientific research was resolved. The proposal stated that the academy and most domestic research institutions have already implemented all points within a possible range, so there seems to be no need to discuss it again. The proposal that the Academia Sinica's Institutes of Physics, Chemistry, and Engineering should jointly organize a scientific instrument manufacturing institute with the government or large businesses was resolved. There are many types of scientific instruments, and the country's technical talents are not enough to meet the needs. The construction of large-scale instrument factories is not easy to achieve at once. The academy seems to be able only to follow its established policy, encourage domestic businesses that can manufacture various instruments themselves, and provide technical assistance. The proposal that the Council of Academia Sinica should appropriately commend those who have made outstanding achievements in scientific research in the country was resolved and passed. The proposal to add international scientific research conferences to the council was resolved. The Academia Sinica will decide on the participation methods and submit them to the government for resolution. Please ask the Academia Sinica to consult with the Ministry of Education on how to handle it. The proposal to plan the source of membership fees for my country to join the International Astronomical Society was resolved. The participating groups can be organized by the Chinese Astronomical Society and the Astronomical Research Institute. The required funds can be discussed and assisted by the Academia Sinica and the Ministry of Education. The draft articles of association for the Yang Quan Ding Wenjiang Scholarship was resolved and the principle was passed. The detailed methods will be determined by the Central Research Army. The proposal to compile a catalog of specialized works from various groups was resolved and passed according to the principles determined by the review. The specialized catalogs compiled in the future should be printed and distributed in groups. Also, Wang Shijie temporarily proposed to amend Article 12 of the Council's election regulations as follows: Candidates for council members will be elected by a roll-call voting method, and the final election will be by a secret ballot voting method. It was resolved and passed. It was also decided that the next annual meeting of the Council will be held during the spring vacation next year. The date will be decided by the secretary.

<h3 id="e89">Details of the Rome Conference of Italy, Austria, and Hungary <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Correspondence from Rome</p>
<p>Two years ago, Italy, Austria, and Hungary signed the "Rome Accords," forming a bloc through economic reciprocity and cultural cooperation. When the League of Nations discussed economic sanctions against Italy, the representatives of Austria and Hungary stated they could not participate, precisely because of this bloc relationship, which prevented them from joining in an unfriendly action towards Italy. Recently, Germany reoccupied the Rhineland with great force, which even France could not deter. Austria was concerned about the stability of its independent status. Italy, with its victories in the war against Abyssinia, was seeking to restore its dominance in Central Europe. Therefore, on the second anniversary of the Rome Accords, it convened Austria and Hungary in Rome for a meeting, hence the origin of this conference.</p>
<p>Participants: The delegations from Austria and Hungary arrived in Rome at 6 p.m. on March 20th. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini personally welcomed them at the station. The Austrian delegation included Chancellor Schuschnigg, Foreign Minister Guido Schmidt, Director of International Politics at the State Council Hornbostel, and the personal secretaries of Schuschnigg and Schmidt. The Hungarian delegation included Prime Minister Gömbös, Foreign Minister Kánya, Director of the State Council's Information Bureau Mikecz, Director of the Foreign Ministry's Information Bureau Mender, and the personal secretaries of Gömbös and Kánya. The Italian ambassadors to Austria, Plessi, and to Hungary, Clonar, also accompanied the delegations to Italy.</p>
<p>Public Agreements: After arriving in Rome, the delegations attended banquets, watched a play at the Royal Theater, visited the Royal University of Rome, and reviewed a cavalry school drill. They held two meetings with the Italian side at the Palazzo Venezia. The Italian attendees included Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mussolini, Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs Suvich, and Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Aloisi. The conference was divided into secret and public parts. The public part resulted in the establishment of "Supplementary Rome Accords," officially signed on March 23rd, consisting of three items, as follows:</p>
<p>The Prime Ministers of Italy, Austria, and Hungary, meeting again in Rome on March 21, 1936, expressed great satisfaction with the continued cooperation between the three countries for the purpose of European peace and economic prosperity. Therefore, they solemnly decided to continue the spirit of the Rome Accords of March 17, 1934, trusting and collaborating in political, economic, and cultural matters. At the same time, in order to develop the interests of the three countries in any aspect and to address the European situation, they decided to form a bloc and establish a permanent mechanism for consultation.</p>
<p>To comply with the aforementioned purpose, the three countries decided that in the future, no major political issues concerning the Danube River would be discussed or agreed upon by any one of the three countries without the consent of the other two. However, any economic agreements already concluded between the three countries and other Danube-related countries would not be bound by this restriction.</p>
<p>The aforementioned permanent consultation mechanism will be composed of the foreign ministers of the three countries. Meetings will be held both regularly and irregularly. The dates of the former will be determined separately, while the latter will be convened when the three governments deem it necessary. The present document will be in Italian, German, and Hungarian. In case of linguistic disputes, the Italian version will be used as the standard for resolution.</p>
<p>Secret Deliberations: In addition to the public agreements, the conference also involved secret deliberations, which had been discussed prior to the meeting. The son of Austrian Vice-Chancellor Starhemberg came to Rome on March 4th to introduce Schuschnigg, and the ambassadors of the three countries had also held secret discussions. These discussions were further confirmed at the conference. According to reporters, the main contents of these secret deliberations included four items:</p>
<p>Absolute guarantee of Austria's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity to maintain security in Central Europe.</p>
<p>Establishment of a military alliance between the three countries.</p>
<p>Economic and financial alliance between the three countries.</p>
<p>Efforts to conclude a Central European pact led by the three countries. In addition, it was decided that the various agreements reached at this conference would be tentatively set for a term of three years, after which further consultations would be held depending on the development of the European situation. The permanent consultation mechanism between the three countries would also meet at any time to seek close cooperation between the three countries.</p>
<p>Prospects for Central European Politics: The relations between Italy, Austria, and Hungary have been exceptionally close since the conclusion of the 1934 Accords. Italy has granted special tariff treatment to Austrian industrial exports and Hungarian grain exports. At the same time, Austria and Hungary have also extended preferential treatment to Italian goods. Italy has also donated a large number of aircraft, and there has been extensive cultural cooperation between the three countries. For example, a large number of Austrian and Hungarian students came to Italy last year to study. The Perugian International University has established a Hungarian section in addition to the English, German, and French sections, with more than 100 Hungarian students studying there. After the Rome conference, the three countries secretly formed a military alliance. This can protect Austria's independence, and Italy's position as a Central European leader will be strengthened, increasing its influence in discussions with Britain and France. In order to oppose Germany, France has recently openly demanded the abolition of economic sanctions against Italy, making its desire for reconciliation with Italy very clear. However, how Italy will use this superior diplomatic position and what developments will occur in Central European politics after this Rome conference are matters worthy of attention.

<h3 id="e90">Major Fire in Huangsha, Guangzhou, on Tiyun Road <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Eighty to Ninety Shops Were Burned Down, More Than One Hundred People Were Injured, and Losses Exceeded One Million Dollars</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Huangsha in Guangzhou is a prosperous area west of the city, facing the Pearl River to the south, with numerous sails and masts. At its western end is the Huangsha Main Station, the terminal of the southern section of the Yuehan Railway, connecting the North River and reaching Wuhan. Travelers and merchants come and go frequently. Several years ago, due to the lack of roads, it suffered a major fire. After the fire, roads were built, the city appearance was renewed, and transportation became more convenient than before. Unexpectedly, at around 1 a.m. on the 11th of this month, a major fire broke out again in the area of Tiyun West Road, Conggui Road, and Mibu Street, burning down eighty to ninety shops, injuring over one hundred firefighters and rescuers, and spreading to the warehouse of the Explosives Monopoly Bureau. The hazardous materials stored there, such as white powder and silver powder, numbered in the thousands of boxes, all consumed by the flames. Consequently, the raging flames soared into the sky, and explosive debris flew in all directions, causing harm to nearby residents and firefighters. Firefighting was particularly difficult. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Tragic Scene of the Burning: At around 1 a.m. on the 11th, while the city residents were sound asleep, a fire suddenly broke out in the rear of the Shenghe Warehouse at No. 3, First Lane, Conggui Road, and the western part of the rear of the Di Ji Peanut Shop at No. 25, Tiyun Road. The flames lit up the sky. By the time the shop employees realized it and sounded the alarm, the fire had already spread. Moreover, the north wind was very strong that night, causing the fire to spread even faster. In an instant, the fire had spread to four locations. Burning south, the back of the rice shops on Mibu Street and the Anle Soda Factory were burned simultaneously. Shops on Tiyun West Road and Desheng Lane on the left and right also suddenly caught fire. Soon, the warehouse of the Explosives Monopoly Bureau at No. 19, First Lane, Conggui Road, containing 1,700 barrels of white powder and explosive leaves, was heated and exploded. At that moment, the fire scene resembled a battlefield, with flames shooting in all directions and white light filling the sky. During the explosions, the ground shook, and door plaques fell one after another. Bricks and tiles flew in all directions. Refugees in the disaster area were scorched and disheveled. Firefighters retreated uniformly. Some who could not escape in time were burned by the fire, reaching over thirty people. The fire engine of the Huangsha Fire Substation was partially destroyed because it was close to the fire scene. The other fire engines of the Fire Department, including Nos. 11, 13, 6, 2, 4, and 8, drew water from the east, west, north, and south and sprayed from afar. The Jinghua Fire Ship, facing the Pearl River, drew water from the river surface and used hoses for remote firefighting. The firefighters bravely dismantled the fire pits and rescued refugees trapped in the fire scene. At that time, cries of distress filled the air, mixed with the sound of explosions, and the collapse of buildings. Displaced refugees huddled on the Shaji Road and Conggui Road. Some lost their children, some abandoned the elderly and weak, and some were groaning in pain. Various charitable organizations immediately dispatched teams to rescue the injured and engage in rescue work.</p>
<p>Number of Deaths and Injuries: That night, the injured firefighters included Zeng Shaoxiong, Chen Xia, Chen Yuan, Liu Rong, and Liu Xiwu, totaling thirty-two. Injured residents included Chen Wenan, Liu Hongqing, Luo Guangming, Lu Bin, Zong Wen, Wang Mingan, Li Chi, Chen Zucheng, Liang Song, Chen Youzhu, Zhou Ji, Dong Liu, Tan Sen, Fan Luoming, Wu Xing, Liang Shugui, Lu Jieping, Lu Sumei, Chen Nv, Li Yongsen, Chen Bing, Liu Rixiu, Mrs. Li, He Baishan, Zou Weichao, Zou Yuebang, Guan Ziying, Lin Jiebiao, Song Meijiao, totaling over thirty people. According to firefighters at the scene, more than ten people were burned to death due to being unable to escape. Due to the traffic disruption, the bodies were not exhumed until the next day. In addition, there were forty to fifty injured people who were not registered, bringing the total number of severely injured to over one hundred and twenty.</p>
<p>Shops Burned Down: Starting from No. 3, First Lane, Conggui Road, about thirty shops were burned down. The back of the rice shops on Mibu Street was completely destroyed by the fire. More than twenty households were burned in Desheng Lane. Shops burned on Tiyun West Road included Da Ji Shop at No. 1, Yun Yuan Tea House at No. 3, vacant shops at Nos. 4 and 7, Xie Fa Iron Shop at No. 9, Jiang Guilin Shop at No. 17, Chang Sheng Shop at No. 19, Yu Long Shop at No. 21, Zhong He Shop at No. 23, Di Ji Shop at No. 25, Fu Sheng Ju at No. 27, You Sheng Shop at No. 29, Huo Hou He Tang Charity Clinic at No. 31, Shun Tai Shop at No. 39, Xin Feng Shop at No. 41, Bi Residence at No. 1, Shende Water Lane, Deng Residence at No. 11, Desheng Lane, Zheng Residence at No. 13, Liang Residence at No. 15, Yang Residence at No. 19, Li Residence at No. 32, Wu Residence at No. 34, Lu Residence at No. 36, Luo Residence at No. 38, Luo Residence at No. 40, Zeng Residence at No. 41, Si He Shop at No. 41, Liang Residence at No. 1, West Fort Ditch, Li Residence at No. 2, Fan Residence at No. 4, Huang Residence at No. 3, Nan He Shop at No. 38, Yi Mei Street, toilet at No. 40, Nan He Warehouse at No. 42, Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15, First Lane, Conggui Road, all vacant shops, Tong Zhi Machine Shop at No. 17, warehouse at No. 19, vacant shops at Nos. 11 and 13, Mibu Street, Zhong Hua Shop at No. 29, Shen Long Shop at No. 3, Zhong Hua Shop warehouses at Nos. 36 and 38, He Li Rice Milling Shop at No. 42, Shen Long Shop at No. 40, He He Rice Shop at No. 44, half of Anle Soda Factory was burned, Tong He Shop at No. 41, Yu Hua Shop at No. 24, both had their rear sections burned, the front section of No. 18 was burned, Gong Xing Warehouse at No. 34, Yu Chang Rice Shop at No. 28, vacant shops at Nos. 26 and 20, a packing shop at No. 12, and three boats near Liu Bo Ditch were also burned. Based on what is known, a total of over eighty shops were burned.</p>
<p>Estimated Losses: Excluding the goods, the value of the burned shops alone is estimated to be no less than 500,000 yuan. The largest loss was the 1,700 boxes of white powder and 50 boxes of silver powder stored in the warehouse of the Explosives Monopoly Bureau, each box weighing 84 catties and 100 catties respectively, with a total value of over 190,000 yuan. The losses of goods and residences in other shops have not yet been fully calculated.</p>
<p>Aftermath: The great fire took until 3 p.m. on the 11th to be completely extinguished. At 11 a.m., the embers of the burlap shop on Mibu Street reignited. Residents, thinking that another fire was about to break out, urgently requested assistance. The Fire Department dispatched two more fire engines to the scene to extinguish the flames. The embers were finally extinguished in the afternoon. Afterwards, the police investigated the cause of the fire and detained Pan, the manager of Shenghe Shop at No. 3, First Lane, Conggui Road, and He, the owner of Di Ji Shop, for questioning at the Huangsha Branch Bureau. Both Pan and He denied that the fire started in their shops, but the residents strongly accused them. The Branch Chief, considering the seriousness of the matter, kept the two in custody pending further investigation. (April 11th evening)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Martial Law Declared in Quanzhou, Fujian <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Due to Treacherous Collaborators Secretly Plotting Disruption, Seven Regulations for Martial Law are Stipulated</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Recently, there have been reports of instability in southern Fujian, with Quanzhou and Yongchun as the central areas, followed by Zhangzhou. The Pacification Commissioner's Office and the Third Pacification Area Command stationed in Quanzhou have issued orders to all subordinate garrisons to strictly guard against any disturbances. The Quanzhou Pacification Command has been particularly strict in its deployment and search of the defense areas under its jurisdiction. The headquarters of the 52nd Regiment of the 9th Division stationed in Quanzhou City announced a temporary martial law order for Quanzhou City and important towns under its jurisdiction from the night of April 9th, and the proclamation of martial law is as follows: "Proclamation: According to reports, many bandits, traitors, and vagrants have infiltrated various important towns in Jinjiang, secretly plotting disruption, and some are posing as refugees, inquiring about local conditions everywhere, showing obvious reactionary behavior. If they are not strictly arrested, it will be insufficient to maintain security. The following regulations are hereby stipulated, and all Lianbao chiefs and Baojia chiefs must strictly comply. Violators will be subject to joint liability. 1. From this (9th) day, temporary martial law is declared in various important towns under Quanzhou jurisdiction. From 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. the following morning, people are not allowed to enter or exit. Military and government personnel are not allowed to pass through the sentry line without official business. 2. All hotels, inns, hospitals, and public institutions that accommodate guests must report to this headquarters for record-keeping and must not conceal them. 3. All Baojia chiefs and militia teams must mobilize in full force to assist the military and police in arresting suspicious persons. 4. The troops stationed at each city gate must strictly check the people entering and exiting. If there are any suspicious persons, they must be arrested immediately. 5. Patrol teams should increase patrols. If they encounter suspicious persons, they must immediately interrogate or arrest them. 6. When the people are interrogated by the military, they should clearly state which Baojia they belong to. If they are from out of town, they should state their business, where they come from, and who they know in Quanzhou. 7. Refugees are not allowed to reside in public places, temples, ancestral halls, etc. in each Bao. The above seven items are hereby proclaimed for immediate knowledge and compliance by all parties."</p>
<p>Quanzhou Prefecture includes the five counties of Jinjiang, Nan'an, Hui'an, Tong'an, and Anxi. Jinjiang, Nan'an, Hui'an, and Tong'an are all coastal counties, which are important areas in southern Fujian, on the west coast of the Taiwan Strait. Furthermore, the Security Office recently captured Liao Heqin, an important member of a secret organization in southern Fujian. According to his confession, his accomplices include Chen Wei-yuan, He Xianzu, Yang Hanlie, Lin Daokuan, Hong Zheming, Guo Zong, Guo Lougu, Wu Peng, Li Fa, Yang Qiyuan, Zhang Jingshan, Li Jinri, He Lifu, Zhang Xiling, and Huang Ada, totaling fifteen people. On the 10th, the Security Office presented a report to the province requesting that these fifteen people be declared wanted for endangering the Republic of China. It is found that Chen Wei-yuan is from Minhou and served as a brigade commander in the 19th Route Army in the 17th and 18th years of the Republic. Later, due to a falling out with Chen Mingshu, he came to Fujian to rely on Fang Shengtao and served as the commander of the Second Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army. He resigned after the 19th Route Army entered Fujian. He Xianzu was the former leader of the Putian militia. He was detained when the 19th Route Army entered Fujian and then resigned. Yang Hanlie was the leader of the Anxi militia with a long history. Lin Daokuan was the leader of the Putian militia. Li Fa was the leader of the Hui'an militia. Hong Zheming was the leader of the Tong'an militia. Guo Lougu was the bandit leader of Putian. Guo Zong was the bandit leader of Anxi. However, in southern Fujian, the so-called militia are actually bandits, as they are sometimes incorporated into the army and are therefore called militia. (April 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e92">Strict Tobacco Prohibition in Fujian Province <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Registration of Smokers Extended and Completed; Those Who Smoke Privately Will Be Executed According to Law</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The investigation and prohibition of tobacco planting and the registration of smokers in Fujian Province have been handled very strictly recently. Regarding the prohibition of planting, after Qiu Hongjun was appointed as the special commissioner for investigating and prohibiting tobacco planting in Fujian by the Tobacco Prohibition Commissioner-General, Qiu has arrived in Fujian and has already worked with the Security Office, the Civil Affairs Department, and administrative commissioners of various districts to send commissioners to various counties to conduct on-site inspections to see if farmers have secretly planted tobacco seedlings and whether officials and troops have harbored and levied contributions. So far, nothing has been found. Qiu is now on a tour of inspection to various counties in eastern Fujian and will transfer to southern Fujian in about two weeks. Although the investigation has not yet been completed, the Fujian Provincial Government has been very serious about the prohibition of tobacco planting for the past two years, and it can be predicted that it has reached the stage of thorough elimination. Regarding licensing, the provincial government has already issued an order to the county governments to complete the handling within the extended deadline. If unregistered smokers are found again after the deadline, they will be executed according to law without leniency. The provincial party headquarters also issued an order to the county party headquarters the day before yesterday to assist the local government in handling tobacco prohibition matters and to convene mass organizations to hold expanded tobacco prohibition propaganda to make smokers aware of the alarm and reform themselves. The provincial capital has recently scheduled to hold an expanded anti-drug propaganda week on the 13th of this month. In addition to convening representatives of various agencies and groups to attend the meeting, each Lianbao office should also organize an anti-drug propaganda team to be directed by the county party headquarters to conduct extensive propaganda within the jurisdiction of the Lianbao. At the same time, the Public Security Bureau will commission the household registration officers of each branch bureau to serve concurrently as smoker registration investigators to check whether there are unregistered smokers in their jurisdictions and ask the Baojia chiefs to sign a guarantee stating that there are no unregistered smokers in their jurisdictions. Then, the Baojia chiefs will ask the heads of each household to sign a guarantee stating that there are no private smokers in their household. If unregistered smokers are found in the future, they will all be held jointly liable. The Bao chiefs are now printing admonitions to smoke and registration notices, and affixing them with guarantees, posting them in various households so that everyone knows and fills out the reports. As for the opium paste used by the licensed smokers in this province, it is contracted for transportation and sales by the Tobacco Prohibition Supervision Sub-Office by inviting merchants to divide the districts. The newly appointed Director Cheng Yunshan believes that there are many abuses in the district contracting and has decided to contract the transportation and sales of opium paste throughout the province to only one merchant from the south, with a capital of 600,000 yuan and a pre-payment of a 100,000 yuan deposit. They must sell at least 2,850 dan of Sichuan, Yunnan, Shaanxi, and Gansu opium paste with affixed stamps each year and pay a license fee of 40,000 yuan, allowing them to establish branches and warehouses in Fuzhou and Xiamen to operate wholesale business. Each county will set up only one opium paste shop, which will be contracted separately by the supervision office by inviting merchants, and the amount of opium paste to be sold each year and the amount of license fee to be paid will depend on the size of the county and the amount and grade.

<h3 id="e93">Robbers Killed One Person in Songjiang <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>On the night of the 15th, at about 2 a.m., the home of Shen Zhenqing, a villager in Zhujiahang Township, Punan, was suddenly attacked by more than ten robbers, all speaking in the local dialect. They broke into the house. Shen Zhenqing, hearing the alarm, sneaked out and summoned the guards of the guardhouse and neighbors to gather and arrest the robbers. Shen also joined in the resistance and injured a robber on the spot. The remaining robbers scattered with the stolen goods. The injured robber was then escorted to the Tinglin First Branch Bureau. It was learned that his name was Shen Zirong. Together with the plaintiff, Shen Zhenqing, they hired a boat and escorted him to Songjiang on the same day. While passing near Zhangze, the robber died of exhaustion in the boat. After arriving in Songjiang, the boat berthed at Lishuiguan Bridge and reported to the bureau for inspection. The county's civil servants' labor service has decided to dredge the section from Fangle Bridge to Hezhuang Bridge in the city. Civil servants from various agencies will be assigned to dredge the work. It has been rescheduled to hold a commencement ceremony at the sports ground at 8 a.m. on the 23rd of this month, and the work will be carried out for three days to dredge the section.

<p>At approximately 11 PM the night before last, at Xiao Mao's residence in Wu Jia, Wu Bao, Dacaixiang Township, within the jurisdiction of Baoshan County, a group of fifteen or sixteen bandits suddenly appeared, wearing short shirts and trousers of blue cloth and speaking with local accents. They were armed with iron and wooden clubs, as well as sharp blades, and proceeded to rob the residence. First, they bound and confined all the men, women, old, and young within the house into one room. Then, they arbitrarily searched and looted the premises. During the robbery, Mao Yucai and Mao Peisheng, who cried for help, were slashed in the head by the bandits. The search and robbery lasted for over four hours, until around 4 AM the following morning, when the bandits finally left, fully satisfied with their loot. As they departed, they left behind three iron clubs and a cloth cap. The stolen items are briefly listed as follows: Mao Rulan's family lost 127 yuan in legal tender, 10 silver dollars, a jade ring (worth over ten yuan), a pair of silver bracelets, a silk floss lined jacket, a gold ring, 20,000 copper coins, a pearl powder spoon (with five pearls), and five more pearls. Mao Zonglin's family lost a gold ring, a gold ring, a gold ear pick, two pairs of silver bracelets, one silver dollar, a pearl ear pick, a silver lock pendant, and over 2,000 copper coins. Mao Yucai's family lost seven yuan in legal tender, one silver dollar, 6,000 copper cash, a pair of twisted silk bracelets, two flat bracelets, a gold ring, a gold ring, and a watch. Mao Peisheng's family lost 82 yuan in legal tender, etc. Afterwards, the victims reported the robbery, along with the three iron clubs and the cloth cap left behind by the bandits, to the township head, Guo Yongfen, the district office, and the Public Security Bureau. They jointly went to investigate and reported the incident to the county government, urging a strict investigation and pursuit of the stolen goods.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Kunshan: Police Academy Students Come to Kunshan for Internship <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Our county is piloting a police district system, which is already taking shape. One hundred and twenty-six students from the Jiangsu Provincial Police Academy refresher course arrived in Kunshan from Zhenjiang on the morning of the 16th for an internship. After one week, they will return to the academy for their graduation ceremony and be assigned to various counties to serve, so as to gain experience. The student dormitory has been set at the Chen Family Shrine on Beitang Street. During the internship, Director Zhang of the Public Security Bureau personally provides guidance. On the 9th of this month, a prisoner named Xu, a smoker, suddenly died in the Fangqiao Detention Center in our county. The result of the examination at the time determined that the death was caused by typhoid fever. Xu Zhen, the son of the deceased, has now learned that his father's death was due to two reasons. After entering the hospital, the opium addiction had not been completely eliminated, and he was sent to the detention center. He had a severe opium craving and asked the detention center for medicine but was beaten instead, causing him to fall to the ground and vomit blood, leading to his death. Another account states that a doctor at the County Hospital mistakenly prescribed medicine, resulting in the injury and death. Given these two versions, a request has been submitted to the county for a re-examination and appeal. Xu Shichang, the judge handling this case, also has many doubts about it and has ordered the warden to file a report.</p>

<p>The preschool primary school in our county is the largest and most developed school in the city, with over one thousand students. The school has as many as two hundred or so delivery workers who bring meals every day. Principal Zou Lianfen, recognizing the opportunity during this period of popularizing literacy, is taking advantage of the opportunity to compile common phrases based on the meal delivery and student pick-up times for these workers. Teachers take turns instructing them for thirty minutes each day, and students at the school review the lessons when they return home. A letter has been sent to the families of each student to discuss and implement this plan.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Wuxi: Eastern Jin Dynasty Ancient City Bricks Discovered <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>In the third district of the county, about three miles from Zhouxin Town, in the Zhangwanli area, which is a necessary route for the Su-Xi Road, there is an earthen mound, about two to three zhang high, and over ten zhang in circumference. Coffins are scattered across the mound and few people visit it. Recently, the Su-Xi Road is under construction and while excavating the earth to fill the roadbed, two large brick tombs were suddenly discovered, buried more than one zhang apart in the middle of the large mound. Each tomb is over two zhang long, six or seven chi wide, and five or six chi high, surrounded by thick walls, and the top is constructed like a city gate arch, using special pointed bricks. Only mud is found in the middle, with nothing else. The ancient bricks of the tomb wall are one chi long, four cun and three fen wide, and one cun and two fen thick. Each brick weighs ten jin, has a dark bluish-green color, and is filled with ancient character; the size is similar to that of city bricks. Another type has diagonal mesh patterns on the surface. According to Cao Hengzhi, an archaeologist in the county, these ancient bricks are called "cloth-pattern bricks" because cloth was used to line the brick blanks during manufacture. One end of the ancient bricks has the seven characters "Fourth Year of Da Xing, August 6th," while the other end has the two characters "One Ten". According to historical records, Da Xing was the reign title of Emperor Yuan of the Eastern Jin Dynasty, corresponding to 321 AD in the Western calendar, meaning that the bricks are 1,615 years old this year. The bricks vary in shape, with the bricks used in the tomb cover being fan-shaped with uneven thickness at both ends and a solid texture. The total number is estimated to be over 10,000, but not all of them have the characters "Fourth Year of Da Xing, August 6th." Although the nearby villagers do not know the history and value of these bricks, driven by curiosity, they are rushing to collect and treasure them.</p>

<p>At about 11 PM the night before last, police officers from the Supervisory Office of the Public Security Bureau raided the Quanxing opium den at the Xinglong Bridge embankment in Xiatang within the city and seized five taels of privately manufactured opium. They also found 63 gray drug pills on Zhou Fuxing, a tea room attendant. They further arrested Shi Atong, an opium addict who sold drug pills, at house number 11 on the embankment, and seized an empty iron can that used to contain drug pills. The female cook of the den, Zhang Aren (also known as Zhang Lanying), the manager Ding Renjing, the caretaker Lu Shouqi, the opium paste maker Zhou Baolin, the opium addict Shi Atong, and the general affairs clerk Zhang Amo, totaling six people, were all taken to the bureau. Yesterday (the 16th), they were transferred to the county government, where Military Judge He held a court hearing. As a result, they were ordered to be detained pending transfer to the Commissioner's Office for interrogation. The Public Security Bureau was instructed to dispatch police officers, along with the local Tu Zheng (local head), to seal up the premises of the opium den and conduct further investigation.</p>

<p>Recently, various counties under the jurisdiction of Nantong district have been continuously sending opium and drug offenders to the Commissioner's Office. After the military judge concludes the trials, they are sent to addiction treatment centers and prisons. The addiction treatment centers, prisons, and opium addict workhouses are all overcrowded.

<p>The Zhenjiang Canal has been in disrepair for years, and residents on both banks arbitrarily dump garbage, causing the riverbed to silt up. During the summer and autumn, boats can still pass, but in winter, the water recedes and the river dries up, making navigation difficult. Even in the spring, the river water rises and falls intermittently, causing inconvenience to navigators. Recognizing that the river is the only waterway for the provincial capital, the Department of Construction ordered the Jiangnan Water Conservancy Engineering Office to quickly dredge it. After receiving the order, the office sent personnel to inspect it. Dredging the Zhenjiang Canal is not difficult, but there are many obstacles, such as removing the houses on both banks. Therefore, they changed their plan to dredge the Dantu Branch River. After the plan was formulated, Gu Houxi was appointed as the director of the engineering office and construction began last December. Since the start of construction, progress has been actively promoted, and the entire project is now largely completed. A stone sluice gate has been built, and the project can be completed by early May. According to news from the Jiangnan Water Conservancy Engineering Office, the completion of the dredging of the canal is of great importance to inland waterway transportation and commerce.</p>

<p>The four-tenths of the quota of the twenty-fourth year salt amount, that had not been collected from the Zhejiang Eastern Salt 引 (Salt Certificate) Public Warehouse in Yuyao was delayed due to the Pengzhang (Salt Transport Head) objecting to the reform of the official weighing system and the payment of capital. The warehouse official is now in urgent need of sales, so on the morning of the 13th, the Zhejiang Eastern General Office and both the Eastern and Western Sub-Offices began collecting salt at the same time and will directly pay the capital within days. The long-unresolved salt turmoil has thus come to an end.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Revision of the Sino-German Commercial Treaty <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Silk Industry Association of this City Sends a Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to Offer Opinions</p>
<p>According to the Hua Dong News Agency, merchants in the silk industry in this city believe that in recent years, China's trade with Germany has been declining. The export of 'Fuchou' silk, for example, used to be worth two to three million yuan per year to Germany, but now it only accounts for 10%, which is only 200,000 yuan per year. The situation is extremely bleak. The reason is due to the heavy taxes imposed by Germany. Recently, the German Ambassador, Mr. Knappe, and the economic representatives specially appointed by the syndicate to investigate China's economic conditions and seek progress in Sino-German trade, have been in contact with the Chinese authorities to revise the new Sino-German Commercial Treaty. Before the conclusion of the new Sino-German treaty, three requests are being made, and a letter is sent to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, so that they can be presented for negotiations. The Chamber of Commerce has now telegraphed these three opinions to the two departments for review. The contents are as follows:</p>
<p>Fuchou silk from Henan and Fuchou silk from Andong, Shandong, are made of Chinese wild silkworm silk. They are strong, durable, and inexpensive, and have long been recognized by various countries as the world's most economical materials. Germany should reduce its import tax.</p>
<p>Fuchou silk produced in Henan, Shandong, and Andong is the lowest and crudest grade of Chinese silk. The prices are low, which is different from other Chinese silk goods. It is not a luxury item, but a purely practical commodity. Germany must not classify it as an imported luxury item.</p>
<p>Germany shall not restrict the import quantity of Fuchou silk produced in Henan, Shandong, and Andong that are exported to Germany. It should be given a superior position and an opportunity for smooth sales.</p>

<p>Total Approved Amount: 12,050 Yuan</p>
<p>There Are Still Many Who Falsely Report Capital in Hopes of Obtaining Loans</p>
<p>The Shanghai Industry and Commerce Loan Review Committee held its 27th meeting at the China National Goods Bank on Tianjin Road at 4:30 PM on the 15th of this month. The committee members present were Cai Zengji, Qin Runqing, Zhang Peishen, Song Ziliang, Xi Demao (Zhang replacing), Yu Zuoting (Runqing replacing), and Bei Songsun. Chairman Cai Zengji reported on routine affairs, then presented 33 applications for small credit loans. After review, it was decided to reduce the loan amount for some, with the total approved loan amount being 12,050 yuan. Another 12 companies were either declared out of business or their business did not meet the principles for loan approval, and their loan applications were rejected. The applicants will be notified separately of all the approved cases. Furthermore, the committee stated that the applicant factories often do not follow the principles stipulated by the ministry, which is that the amount requested should not exceed half of the capital. Although the committee staff has repeatedly informed them in detail and published notices in newspapers, many still falsely report their capital in hopes of obtaining loans. The committee has decided to directly reject applications that do not comply with the regulations and will not investigate them. Factories wishing to apply for loans should be sure to pay attention and inquire in detail when obtaining the application form at the committee office on the upper floor of the National Goods Bank on Tianjin Road, to avoid being rejected and wasting effort.</p>
<h3 id="e111">The Yili Company Debt Dispute Was Resolved Yesterday <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Unanimous Support for Four Principles for Resumption of Business</p>
<p>Number of Creditor Representatives Expanded to Seventeen</p>
<p>Shanghai Huashang Yili Soda Company and Yili Glass Factory were forced to close down in September last year and are heavily in debt. The debt dispute could not be resolved, so they sought assistance from the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association. The association convened a meeting of all creditors yesterday afternoon to mediate. With the agreement of the public, four principles were decided and a settlement was announced. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives Present: The attendees yesterday included 122 creditor representatives, including Cheng Shouchong, Gui Xinyou, Xi Kang, Zhang Hanru, and Chen Baoli, as well as the mediators Yu Qiaqing, Fang Jiaobo, Zhang Jixian, Sun Meitang, Yuan Ludeng, Jin Tingsun, Mao Heyuan, Dong Xingsheng, Zhu Meixian, and Ren Jinping. Yu Qiaqing was elected as the chairman, and Ren Jinping was the recorder.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: After the ceremony, Chairman Yu Qiaqing reported that the Yili Soda Factory and Glass Factory founded by Xu Tingzuo are famous national goods industries in Shanghai with excellent products. The business was originally very prosperous. However, because Mr. Xu was too enthusiastic about investing in the development of Sanmen Bay, and the financial panic in recent years has become increasingly serious, he was forced to declare bankruptcy last year under economic pressure. The assets of the two factories were taken over by the Hui Zhong Bank, the first priority creditor, and the Meifeng Bank Liquidation Office, the second priority creditor. Mr. Xu believes that the two factories used to have annual profits of 30,000 and 50,000 yuan respectively. If they are sold off at auction, not only will the business be completely destroyed, but the other creditors will inevitably receive nothing. Feeling deeply uneasy, he tried his best to find a way to negotiate with the first and second priority creditors to temporarily suspend the execution. The first priority creditor learned that the two factories do have annual profits and has agreed to temporarily suspend the execution with the consent of the second priority creditor. The first priority creditor is willing to provide additional funds to assist in the resumption of business with the consent of other creditors. To this end, Mr. Xu specifically wrote to the association requesting that it convene all creditors other than the priority creditors to discuss mediation methods. The association believes that Mr. Xu has been very enthusiastic about social welfare and national goods industries in the past. Now that Mr. Xu is facing difficulties, it is appropriate to provide assistance under legal and reasonable conditions. Considering that many of the creditors other than the priority creditors are fellow Ningbo provincials, for the sake of safeguarding the rights and interests of the fellow provincials and other creditors, it is felt that this mediation request is also very beneficial. It is possible to find a suitable guarantee by following this mediation path. Therefore, the association accepted Mr. Xu's request and invited everyone to attend the meeting to discuss a solution, hoping that everyone would uphold the principle of safeguarding their own creditor's rights and safeguarding the national goods industry, and express their opinions. The association is willing to participate in the efforts with everyone's consent.</p>
<p>Principles Resolved: After the report, Fang Jiaobo stated the intentions of the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association to accept mediation. Then, each creditor expressed their opinions. Finally, four principles were decided:</p>
<p>All creditors unanimously support the resumption of business of Yili Soda Company and Yili Glass Factory.</p>
<p>Creditors shall jointly elect representatives to discuss methods for assisting in the resumption of business and repayment of debts.</p>
<p>Based on the above resolution, further negotiate with the first and second creditors to determine a written method for reducing the amount of debt, and request the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association to assist in the process.</p>
<p>According to the second resolution, 17 representatives shall be elected to form a delegation (with creditors holding 5,000 yuan or more as representatives). With the agreement of the creditors, a settlement was announced on the spot, signed by both the creditor and debtor, and will be implemented accordingly.</p>

<p>Temporary Suspension of Regular Public Funeral at Renxiao Funeral Parlor</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Lin Yishun, a prominent overseas Chinese leader and pioneer of the revolution, passed away in Shanghai some time ago. It was originally planned that his eldest son, Zhongguo, would escort the coffin back to Singapore for burial on the 14th of this month. However, due to the decision to hold a public funeral, it has been decided that the coffin will be transported to the North Station at 7:55 AM tomorrow and then transported to Beijing by special train. In addition to his son, Zhongguo, those escorting the coffin will include Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee members Zhang Yongfu, Feng Ziyou, Zhang Huadan, Shao Fu, and Lu Shiying, among others. The coffin will be transported from the Universal Funeral Parlor to the North Station without any ceremonial guard of honor. However, the Public Security Bureau band will play music at the North Station to see off the deceased. The special train will arrive in Beijing at 1:50 PM tomorrow. Lin's coffin will be temporarily placed at the Renxiao Funeral Parlor on Mochou Road for burial. His son, Zhongguo, will return to Shanghai in two weeks to await a ship back to the South. Once the burial date is set, he will return to Shanghai and then go to Beijing with his family. A brief biography of Mr. Lin and his contributions to the revolution are attached below.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin's Biography: Mr. Lin's given name is Yishun, and his courtesy name is Fachu. He was from Chenghai, Guangdong. He lost his parents at a young age and lived with his maternal grandparents in Singapore. At the age of ten, he entered St. Joseph's School and graduated at seventeen to study commerce. At the age of twenty, his maternal grandfather passed away, and he inherited a portion of his estate. At the age of twenty-three, he married Ruan Ju'an's eldest daughter, Bixia, and had sons Guo Zhong, Zhong Bang, Zhong Min, and daughter Zhiyu, etc. At the age of twenty-four, he joined his uncle Zhang Yongfu and friend Chen Chunan in engaging in the revolution. Dr. Sun Yat-sen admired his intelligence and entrusted him with handling all matters, large and small. He often engaged in agriculture, planting rubber trees and pineapples. After a year, when the Ba San Wang Company was established, he was appointed as the manager. He then took in comrades who had fled after the Huanghuagang Uprising as assistants, working tirelessly. After three years, he gained assets of hundreds of thousands and became known as the "Pineapple King." The rubber trees also yielded a large harvest, accumulating assets of up to one million. He then built the Zhanhua Villa to entertain comrades who had fled, such as Hu Hanmin, Wang Jingwei, and Bai Wenwei, all of whom were welcomed. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the Provisional President awarded him a Certificate of Honor. Mr. Lin was also extremely enthusiastic about public welfare in Singapore. The British government appointed him as a member of the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, a Justice of the Peace, and a member of the Opium Review Committee. He was also elected as Chairman or Director of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the Chaozhou Eight District Association, and the Hua Shang Bank, among others.</p>
<p>Revolutionary Achievements: After the Mao Su newspaper case, Zhang Binglin and Zou Rong were arrested in Shanghai, and Qing officials demanded their extradition. Lin, Zhang Yongfu, and Chen Chunan telegraphed the Shanghai consular body to strongly protest. In the year Gui Mao, Zhang Yongfu and Chen Chunan founded the "Tu Bao" newspaper in Singapore. Lin took on the task of promoting the revolution back in China, carrying thousands of copies of "Tu Cun Bian" (i.e., "Revolutionary Army") and secretly entering Chaozhou, Xiamen, and other places to spread propaganda. In the year Bing Wu, Dr. Sun Yat-sen formed the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) in Singapore, and Lin was elected as the director of the social affairs section. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, along with Chen Chunan and Lin, went to Kuala Lumpur to establish the Tongmenghui. They then entered Perak, but were rejected by opponents. They accompanied Dr. Sun Yat-sen into a foreign hotel to avoid trouble. Chen Chunan and Lin were ordered by Dr. Sun Yat-sen to establish the Tongmenghui in Penang and then went with Wu Yingpei to establish the Tongmenghui in Yangon. When the Tongmenghui established the "Zhongxing Daily," Lin was the general manager. During the Huanghuagang Uprising, Lin provided substantial financial assistance. After the failure, many comrades who had fled received assistance from Lin to support their lives. When Yu Jicheng was arrested in Hong Kong, Lin helped to rescue him. After the Zhennanguan Uprising failed, more than six hundred soldiers who fled to Singapore were largely assisted by Lin. When Wang Jingwei plotted to assassinate Prince Regent Zai Feng in Beijing and the matter was exposed, Chen Bijun went to Nanyang to raise funds for his rescue. Lin contributed four hundred dollars. Huang Xing and Hu Hanmin raised funds for the March 29th Uprising in the year Xin Hai, and Lin donated a considerable amount. During the Wuchang Uprising, Lin, Zhang Yongfu, and Chen Chunan formed the Fujian Security Donation and Guangdong Relief Security Donation groups, raising funds to support the military, making great contributions. When Yuan Shikai stole the country, many comrades fled to Nanyang, and Lin entertained them at Honghua Villa, using Tongmei Bank as a secret communications point, which was greatly resented by the local government. During the campaign against Yuan Shikai, Lin provided a lot of financial assistance. When the Guangdong Army returned to Guangdong, Lin once provided ten thousand taels of silver to support the military and raised 300,000 yuan. When Dr. Sun Yat-sen assumed the position of Extraordinary President in Guangdong, Lin personally participated. When Dr. Sun Yat-sen assumed the position of Grand Marshal, he appointed Lin as an advisor to the headquarters.</p>

<p>Bank Acceptance Bills Have Achieved Results; Money Shops Set to Discuss Internal Rates on the 25th</p>
<p>With the end of April approaching, banks and money shops have been directly contacting commercial firms and factories that have long-term loans due to negotiate extension procedures. However, loans to commercial firms and factories with poor credit are being recalled. The recovered funds are then being loaned to reliable and well-established commercial firms and factories, making the market very stable. The daily published morning and afternoon Shanghai interbank offered rates (SHIBOR) have been eight fen for several days. However, in previous years, the rates before the end of April were usually between three and four jiao.</p>
<p>Money Shops Scheduled to Discuss Internal Rates: The Money Shops Association will hold a special meeting of member representatives at its offices on Ningbo Road at 1:00 PM on April 25th to discuss internal rates as the end of April approaches. Regarding the 18 million yuan that various money shops borrowed from the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, which has been repeatedly extended, it is said that the money shops that have borrowed the money have received a notice from the Money Shops Supervisory Committee, allowing them to find ways to repay the loans after the end of April.</p>
<p>Acceptance Bills Have Been Quite Effective: Since the establishment of the Bank Union Reserve Committee, which includes bank acceptance facilities, an agreement has been made with member banks whereby member banks can apply to the facility for acceptance of commercial bills. A number of applications have been approved and signed after a thorough review. These bills have been circulating in the market and have been well-received by Chinese and foreign banks and various industries, who are happy to accept them. The facility also publishes the discount rate for 90-day bank acceptance bills daily. Yesterday, it was one jiao and two fen per thousand yuan.</p>
<p>The Total Amount of Negotiable Instruments Has Increased: Since the Central Bank and money shops joined the negotiable instruments clearing house established by the Bank Union Reserve Committee, the total amount of exchanged negotiable instruments has increased. Yesterday, the total amount was 55,598,157.59 yuan, including 14,659,520.10 yuan in exchanged amounts, 37,233,236.68 yuan in transferred amounts, 2,562,101.17 yuan collected on behalf of money shops, and 1,476,205.64 yuan for other items.

<h3 id="e117">The Rickshaw Driver Registration Craze Has Generally Abated Yesterday; The Vehicle Committee Continued Registration Yesterday; The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sent a Letter to the Public Works Department to Correct the Quota <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Public Works Department's Vehicle Committee accepted the request of the rickshaw owners to continue registering rickshaw drivers, but limited the quota to only 5,000 people. However, there are about 20,000 rickshaw drivers who are unemployed because they have not registered and cannot pull rickshaws. Therefore, they are deeply dissatisfied with this quota. They held a rally and parade on the morning of the 14th, which clashed with the patrolmen, and 23 people were arrested. As of yesterday, the situation has calmed down. The Vehicle Committee has also agreed to continue registration. However, the unemployed rickshaw drivers feel that there is too little porridge for too many monks and that the meager quota of 5,000 is difficult to distribute. Therefore, they are reluctant to come forward. As a result, only a hundred people applied to the Vehicle Committee for registration yesterday.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Official Letter: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that the Public Works Department's Vehicle Committee's continued registration of rickshaw drivers is too small and fails to provide universal relief to unemployed rickshaw drivers. Yesterday, it sent a letter to the Public Works Department requesting correction of the Vehicle Committee's quota and expansion. The original letter stated: "It has been learned that the Vehicle Committee of your department is continuing to register rickshaw drivers based on the request of rickshaw owners. However, there are nearly 10,000 rickshaws in the Public Concession. Owners with two rickshaws are required to recommend one person, and those with three rickshaws are required to recommend one person, limiting the total number to a maximum of 5,000 people. The demand exceeds the supply, resulting in yesterday's conflict between rickshaw drivers and patrolmen. At a time when rural areas are bankrupt and unemployed poor people are flocking to Shanghai, they cannot even find a coolie's life. The Vehicle Committee of your department should take a broader view and handle the matter fairly when continuing to register rickshaw drivers this time. If the restrictions are too narrow, it would be contrary to the Vehicle Committee's stated aim of benefiting rickshaw drivers. It is appropriate to inform your department of the situation and ask you to investigate it. The Vehicle Committee's method of restricting the registration of rickshaw drivers should be corrected quickly to avoid confrontation. We are deeply concerned."</p>
<p>Rickshaw Owners Meeting: The Shanghai Rickshaw Association and the Special Zone Office will hold a meeting of the Custodial Committee at the association at 7:00 PM today to benefit rickshaw drivers and discuss important issues such as raising funds to build dormitories and rickshaw registration. Yesterday, a notice was issued to all committee members stating: "Respectfully, it is hereby ordered that the Custodial Committee will hold a meeting at the association on Lloyd Road at 7:00 PM on April 17th (Friday) to discuss important issues. It is hoped that you will spare some time to attend the meeting on time. Please do not delay. Thank you."</p>

<h3 id="e125">The French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association Explains the Meaning of Recruiting Members - Reply to the Letter from the Third District Branch of the Municipal Federation <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Times News: The Third District Branch of the French Concession Citizens' Federation sent a letter requesting an explanation because the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association's recruitment of members was hindered. The Chinese Ratepayers Association replied to the Third District Branch of the Citizens' Federation in accordance with the Association's charter. The original letter stated: "Direct reply: Received your letter, (briefly stating) Recently, our association sent personnel to recruit members within the boundaries of this district. We learned that your association is also recruiting members, which has made our progress quite difficult. However, we believe that your association is the representative body of all Chinese ratepayers in the French Concession. All Chinese ratepayers are members. In short, all Chinese in the French Concession are members. Therefore, there is no organization without members. Now your association suddenly has this act of recruiting members, and our association is deeply puzzled and dares to ask for a detailed explanation, etc." This is approved. Article 6 of Chapter 2 of our association's charter states that any Chinese ratepayer residing in the French Concession who has one of the following qualifications and is registered as a member after issuing an entry card may be a member of this association and have the right to elect representatives to the general assembly: (A) Those who pay donations for properties with a land price of 500 yuan or more; (B) Those who pay more than 10 yuan in house or land donations annually. Therefore, Chinese ratepayers within the concession who have the qualifications for membership but have not registered as members cannot be called members of this association. The association's charter is very detailed. The purpose of our association's recruitment of members is to have the ratepayers within the concession who have not registered as members complete the registration. The above is the reason for the letter and a corresponding reply. I hope you will take note of it. This is addressed to the Third District Branch of the Citizens' Federation, from the Chinese Ratepayers Association."</p>

<p>Wu Liangcai Glasses Shop, No. 155 Fangbang Road in the city, was opened by Wu Guocheng and managed by Yu Ziming. The shop is an old shop with decades of history and is the crown of the industry. At 7:00 p.m. last night, just as it was closing, three robbers suddenly came. All of them were wearing long robes and felt hats. Two of the robbers held guns, and one robber stood guard. They broke into the shop and forbade any sound. They stole the cash and corner tickets in the drawer of the account table, totaling about 40 yuan, and wrapped more than one hundred pairs of eyeglass lenses that were being worked on in felt and escaped with the loot. After the robbers left, the police station in charge was immediately notified to request a strict search.</p>

<p>Tan Jiazhen, a native of Huzhou, Zhejiang, is 40 years old and lives at No. 30 Qu Lane, South Gate, Huzhou. He was able to make a living by inheriting his ancestors' legacy, but soon it gradually declined, and he had no skills to develop. Thinking that Shanghai's industry and commerce were the best in the country, he could find a place to settle down and temporarily fill his stomach. At the beginning of this month, he mortgaged all his possessions and set off from Huzhou to find a way, but half a month later, nothing had been achieved, and the funds he carried had been exhausted. Wanting to return to his hometown, he knew it would be difficult to plan. Turning and thinking, he suddenly developed a feeling of厭世, and yesterday afternoon, at the intersection of Pingliang Road and Linping Road, when people were unprepared, he jumped into the Huangpu River. Fortunately, at that time, Patrolman Xi Tan No. 222 led the Yibu and other patrols to pass by the place. Suddenly, they heard the sound of water crashing in the river and rushed to investigate. They were discovered and rescued in a hurry, and sent to the hospital for treatment. Fortunately, he did not drink much water and is expected to survive.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a letter was sent to various charitable organizations for assistance</p>
<p>Wang Yiting, chairman of the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Federation, in view of the fact that the exposed bones of floating coffins in Tongli, Shengze, Lili, Zhenze, Yan, Pingwang, Bei, Hubin, Luxu, Xinta, Beiku, and other remote areas of Wujiang County, Jiangsu, and Jiaxing, Wangdian, Puruan, Wangjiangjing, Pinghu, Xincheng, Huzhou, Tanghui, and other townships in Zhejiang, are extremely tragic, so he entrusted Wang Junsheng, Weng Yinchu, and other directors of the Pushan Villa to be responsible for handling the burial affairs in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The results have been very remarkable in recent years, raising a total of more than 27,000 yuan and collecting more than 80,000 exposed bones. People from all over the world have praised and praised it. A free public cemetery should be held, and preparations are underway. Yesterday, together with Pushan Villa, a letter was sent to the Charitable Organizations Federation, requesting to convene a meeting of various charitable organizations in the city to discuss and provide strong assistance. The letter is as follows: Our villa, since the winter of 1928, has been gratefully assisted by the association with a fund of 2,000 yuan. Director Wang Junsheng personally went to Jiaxing and Wujiang to conduct field investigations. There are more than 10,000 floating coffins along the way. Director Wang worked hard to raise a fund of 27,000 yuan and immediately started work. Up to now, more than 85,000 exposed bones have been collected, with a total expenditure of more than 29,000 yuan. Charity and health have both benefited. Local people have praised and praised it. However, due to the shortage of funds, it is impossible to continue, and the work has been suspended. There are still six or seven thousand floating coffins that have not been buried. The exposed bones are very pitiful and regrettable. Furthermore, the inland atmosphere is bad, and they are often not buried for a long time. This hinders hygiene and obstructs the view. To seek a thorough and complete plan, it is not easy to achieve results if a public cemetery is not held. As for the cemetery land, our villa has 185 mu of Zetian land in the San Gu Temple in Jiaxing, which can be allocated for application. In Wujiang, another 100 mu of land will be found. After its establishment, it will be presented to the government for filing and announced to the public. If there are any more floating coffins, the Baojia chief will be responsible for investigation. If this is done, it will be a permanent solution. It is estimated that it will take 6,000 yuan to start this public cemetery. All coffin burials will be free of charge, so that the bad habits of floating coffins can be corrected. As for the 60,000 unburied exposed remains, other methods should be found to raise funds and buried on the spot as usual. However, our villa is currently experiencing difficulties in terms of funding and has to truthfully submit it. I think your association can advocate in the past and will definitely maintain it in the future. I pray that your association will look at the humble opinions, convene a meeting, and provide strong assistance, so that it can be completed as soon as possible and the merit is immeasurable.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Chen Diaoyuan Gave Gold to Gao Zhiqing, Suddenly a Debt Lawsuit Arose After Gao's Death <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Friendship is Seen in Life and Death, the Court Approved the Summons of Chen to Court</p>
<p>Chen Diaoyuan, the current President of the Military Senate, and the late Liaoning Gao Zhiqing (Ming Jing) had an old friendship. In 1913, Feng Guozhang served as the Vice President and concurrently as the Governor of Jiangsu. Gao served as Feng's senior adviser, and Chen was the Commander of the Gendarmerie at that time. They were very close and their friendship grew. Later, when Chen became the governor, he appointed Gao as the Secretary-General. Before long, they concluded a marriage between their children. Gao gave his eldest daughter to Chen's second son. Since then,</p>
<p>Increasingly Close. In 1928, they jointly opened the Yucheng Company, specializing in the sale of coal from the Poler Coal Company and the Poler Coal Mine. A contract was signed to exclusively sell the mine's products. At that time, Chen paid 150,000 yuan and Gao paid a capital of 20,000 yuan. Chen was the chairman of the company and Gao was the manager. However, one year later, the debt owed by Poler to Yucheng reached 133,300 gold. Yucheng sued the court for a judgment to repay the amount in installments, including interest, and Chen transferred the debt owed to him.</p>
<p>Gifted to Gao</p>
<p>This was because Chen's second son was unwilling to marry Gao's daughter. At that time, the marriage had already been dissolved. Chen felt deeply sorry for Gao, so in addition to recognizing Gao's eldest daughter as his goddaughter, he also gave him the debt he was entitled to, in order to show his reconciliation. In August of last year, when Gao was critically ill, he wrote a will to distribute the Poler debt to his daughters-in-law Gao Yuxiu, Gao Shengzhenqing, and his grandchildren Gao Zepu, Gao Zehou, etc. Then the heirs jointly submitted a report to the First Special District Local Court</p>
<p>Approved for Management</p>
<p>The inheritance was on file. Now Chen Yinan, who was authorized by Chen Diaoyuan as the legal representative of Yucheng Company, hired Lawyer Dong Yu to file a lawsuit against Gao Yuxiu and other four people in the First Special Court, claiming that after the judgment was finalized, the debt owed by Poler was settled out of court. Poler repaid 145,000 yuan in principal and interest. On the day the settlement contract was signed, 30,000 yuan was paid first, and the remaining amount was paid in installments. Until Gao Zhiqing died,</p>
<p>Poler Collected 30,000</p>
<p>3,000 yuan, not a penny was delivered to the plaintiff, but was deposited in the bank under a pseudonym. When he died, he listed the money he kept that belonged to Yucheng in his will, so that his family could gain illegal benefits. After Gao Zhiqing's death, the defendants secretly collected 6,000 yuan from Poler, so they sued to order the defendants to repay 39,000 yuan in national currency, as well as interest, etc. Gao and others were accused and also hired Lawyer Shi Liang to defend, first stating that Chen Gao had a long-standing friendship and jointly invested in business,</p>
<p>Married for Children</p>
<p>Later, due to disagreements between the children, the marriage was dissolved. Chen then told the story of how he gave all the debt he had obtained to Gao. He then said that the plaintiff was not qualified to sue in the name of Yucheng Company, and Chen Yinan's name as legal representative was also illegal. Finally, he said that Chen Diaoyuan had given the debt to the defendant in the past, and there were various material evidence and witnesses to prove it. Now that his old friend has died,</p>
<p>The Bones Are Not Cold</p>
<p>He suddenly suppressed the facts and argued with the orphans and widows, requesting that Chen Diaoyuan be summoned to the case for detailed trial and to reject the original lawsuit, etc. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Yuhai of the First Special Court opened the court and briefly questioned both lawyers and Chen Yinan. The court approved the defendant's request and ordered a postponement, pending Chen Diaoyuan's summons to court for further questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Another Disturbance in the Gu Zhuxuan Case <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Xue Zhenyi Entrusted a Lawyer to Publish an Advertisement, Denying that He Authorized Zhao Guangfu to Sue Gu</p>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, the former owner of the Tianchan Stage, was detained by the Second Special Court for allegedly instigating the assassination of Tang Jiapeng and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Gu refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Second Branch of the Higher Court. During the open trial, the murderer Zhao Guangfu suddenly recanted his confession, saying that Xue Zhenyi, a prison lawyer, and Zhu Jincheng, Zhang Wenbing, etc. had authorized him to tell Gu Zhuxuan Wang Xinggao and others. Now, it is learned that Xue Zhenyi recently hired Lawyers Lou Yunmei and Liu Liangcai to publish a notice in the newspaper, stating, "According to the above-mentioned parties, Zhao Guangfu, not knowing what evil intentions he has, took advantage of the open court during the trial of Gu Zhuxuan's case to indiscriminately slander me and do his best to defame me. He said that I am a prison lawyer and that I and Zhu Jincheng and Zhang Wenbing authorized me to tell Gu Zhuxuan and Wang Xinggao. I have never met Zhao Guangfu before, and I have no hatred with Gu, Wang, etc. In addition, under special circumstances, I have lost my freedom, how can I participate in the discussion? It is known that it is a castle in the air and an attempt to tell a story. I believe that the court authorities will hang up the Qin mirror and the truth will come out sooner or later. However, Zhao Guangfu's behavior is particularly detrimental to my reputation. In addition to pursuing legal action, I also ask you to publish a statement in the newspaper." Zhao's empty words caused another unexpected communication.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Chinese Fresh Vegetables: Fiji to Ban Imports <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Trade with Fiji Plummets</p>
<p>Exports Sharply Decrease</p>
<p>According to a person who engages in procurement and transporting goods to the Philippines, who spoke to this publication, the most frequent exports from our country to the Philippines used to be fresh eggs, lard, raw oil, as well as fresh vegetables and refrigerated cargo. In previous years, just the item of first-grade lard alone could be shipped at least 5,000 tons per month. Now it has decreased to less than 200 tons. As for fresh eggs, in the past, thousands of boxes were shipped at a time, but now they are almost nonexistent. The fundamental reason for this is, first, the Fijian government</p>
<p>increased tariffs</p>
<p>on goods from our country, increasing heavy taxation on Chinese domestic products sent to the Philippines, which adds to the cost. This makes it impossible for Chinese merchants to purchase and sell. Due to the risk of financial loss, Chinese merchants have had to stop trading collectively. Now the Fijian government is encouraging locals to raise chickens themselves. In the future, Chinese fresh eggs will disappear from the island. Other products, such as lard and raw oil, are being</p>
<p>dumped into Fiji by the Japanese</p>
<p>because the Northeast has been lost and the Japanese have gained the production areas. The Japanese are taking advantage of various superior positions to gradually eliminate Chinese goods from the market. The Japanese have already achieved economic and trade priority in various parts of Fiji, and Chinese goods will have even less of a tendency to develop in the future. Furthermore, sweet potatoes, fresh vegetables, and fruits have always been produced exclusively by our country and have been the most profitable exports in our trade with Fiji. However, recently, a reliable report has been received that the Fijian government has already made a decision to ban Chinese</p>
<p>vegetables and fruits</p>
<p>from being imported, and this will be implemented soon. Since Chinese fresh vegetables and fruits will no longer be able to be shipped there, the Fijian government, in order to supply the needs of the people, is already encouraging local cultivation. The major shipping companies in this port, which have an average of twelve to fourteen mail ships sailing to Fiji each month, relied on the above-mentioned lard, raw oil, fresh eggs, vegetables, and fruits as their main exports. Now they are also suffering a major blow, and their business has plummeted. The cargo shipped each time by each ship is less than one-twentieth of what it was a few years ago. This is truly unfortunate.</p>

<p>Two Batches, Totaling Four Large Crates and Eight Large Packages, Valued at Over 3,000 Yuan, All Confiscated</p>
<p>Yesterday, the joint transportation depot at the North Railway Station discovered two batches of smuggled artificial silk being transported from the Tianjin main station to Shanghai. One batch consisted of four large wooden crates, valued at over 1,200 yuan. The other batch consisted of eight large packages, valued at over 2,000 yuan. The total value was over 3,000 yuan. After customs officers stationed at the station reported this to the Inspector General of Customs, at about 2:00 PM that afternoon, the goods were loaded onto trucks and taken to customs for auction and confiscation. It is reported that customs has heard of smuggled goods arriving at the North Station, so they have dispatched several officers to work with railway personnel and stationed them at the station full-time to step up their efforts to maintain customs revenue.</p>

<p>Lawyer Chen Passionately in Love with Russian Girl, Old Man Mauko Sues for Injury from Fall</p>
<p>—Defendant Guo Zongwen Did Not Appear Due to Illness—</p>
<p>Lawyer Chen, who resides at No. 31 North Sichuan Road, became acquainted with a 15-year-old Russian girl named Popova. They often went out together, and their friendship was quite deep. They were often seen at dance halls and nightclubs. On the night of September 28th of last year, Chen and his friend, an elderly Russian man named Mauko, went to the Saint George Dance Hall in the French Concession to dance. Suddenly, they saw Popova dancing intimately with a Cantonese man named Guo Zongwen. Chen became enraged. Later, because Guo and the girl went to the Metropolis Dance Hall on Gordon Road to continue dancing, Chen and Mauko also followed them. They chose seats next to Guo Zongwen and glared at him, waiting for an opportunity to act. Around midnight, the two sides began to argue, and then began to fight outside the dance hall. At that time, Chen's companion, the elderly Russian man Mauko, unable to withstand the attack, fled outside. As soon as he reached the entrance, he was tripped by someone, causing his arm to break, and he was seriously injured. However, Guo Zongwen was still unwilling to give up and chased after Mauko, punching him in the back. Eventually, others intervened and persuaded them to stop. The dance hall hired a car to take Mauko to the Baolong Hospital, and the incident was reported to the Xinzha Police Station, which sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. They found Guo at the Saint Anna Dance Hall. At the time, Guo expressed his willingness to pay the medical expenses, and Mauko did not object. So Guo paid 100 yuan for medical expenses, and the matter was settled. Unexpectedly, on the 4th of this month, lawyer Chen Dazhu, representing Mauko, sent a letter to the Legal Department of the Municipal Council, accusing Guo Zongwen of assault and requesting permission to sue. After receiving the letter, the Legal Department reported it to the First Special Court, which issued a subpoena and sent it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Chinese Detective Tang Zihong went to Guo Zongwen's residence at Room 211 of the Cangzhou Hotel to summon him. Yesterday morning, Judge Ye Shengchao presided over the trial in the Second Criminal Court. Neither the victim Mauko nor lawyer Chen Daxun appeared in court. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu presented the above facts and charged Guo with assault under Article 277 of the Criminal Code. The defendant Guo Zongwen did not appear, but sent a lawyer to court, stating that Guo was ill and requesting a postponement. The court ordered that the case be postponed for seven days.</p>

<p>Sister-in-Law Awakened and Stabbed with a Sharp Blade</p>
<p>Lu Guisheng, a native of Pudong, used to sell vegetables in the Wuzhou Road vegetable market. Recently, he lost heavily in gambling and was penniless. Unable to raise money, he went to the Zhongshan Hotel at No. 13 X'ian Road late one night. At 4:30 AM, armed with a flashlight and a sharp knife, he sneaked out. From the drying platform of No. 8 Baoyu Lane on Wuzhou Road, where his fellow townsman Gong Chuntao lived, he used a rope to climb into the bedroom of his brother Zhang Xigen's sister-in-law Qiao on the upper floor. He robbed a gold lock piece and a gold chain, worth 300 yuan, which his sister-in-law Qiao had hidden in a drawer. Ms. Qiao was awakened from her sleep and quickly got up to hug him and shout. Lu immediately took out a sharp knife and stabbed her head, face, and back. Ms. Qiao fell to the ground in pain. Lu took the opportunity to abandon the knife and flee. He was apprehended by Chinese Detective Shao Jingfan and Detective Zhang Desheng of the Jiaxing Road Police Station. Lu claimed that he had conspired with Xi Chuntao beforehand, so Xi was also arrested. Both were taken to the police station along with the knife and rope. The injured party was taken to Guangren Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, Lu and Xi were brought before the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Municipal Council lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the case, saying that Zhang Qiao was still in the hospital and requested a postponement. Subsequently, the Chinese and Western detectives reported the details and presented the knife and rope. According to Zhang Xigen, Lu Guisheng was indeed his cousin and at that time, he was selling beef at the small vegetable market.

<h3 id="e145">Strict Enforcement of Anti-Smoking Campaign Leads to Decrease in Smokers; Six Opium Dens Close Down <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Most New Licenses for the 25th Year Have Been Renewed; Strict Investigation of Public Officials Protecting Smoking and Gambling Is Absolutely Determined</p>
<p>The new licenses for the 25th year for opium dens approved by the municipal government have already begun to be renewed. Since the strict enforcement of the anti-smoking campaign in Shanghai, the number of smokers has gradually decreased. Therefore, when renewing licenses this year, six opium dens in the northern and southern parts of the city, including Lao Yufeng, have closed down. The Public Security Bureau issued a notice yesterday stating that after finding public officials protecting smokers, they will be severely punished. A reporter from the Dagong News Agency has investigated and reported on the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Opium Den Licenses: Renewal Begins</p>
<p>In the northern and southern districts of the city, opium dens that have been approved to operate by the Municipal Government Public Security Bureau and have been issued business licenses include 12 opium distributors (those who transport opium from Hankou opium warehouses to Shanghai and resell it to opium dens), 54 grade A opium dens, 25 grade B opium dens, and 1 grade C opium den. The business licenses for the 24th year of the Republic have expired, and the new licenses for the 25th year have already begun to be renewed this month. According to news from the Licensing Department of the Public Security Bureau, more than 50 opium dens have already renewed their licenses in recent days. The licenses for a small number of establishments expire between September and October, and they will renew them after they expire.</p>
<p>Six Opium Dens Close Down</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Public Security Bureau began implementing the anti-smoking campaign on July 1st of last year, under the order of the Anti-Smoking Supervision Department of the Military Affairs Commission, more than 35,000 people have registered voluntarily or been forced to register. The number of people sent to smoking cessation hospitals for forced cessation or who voluntarily entered hospitals for cessation has also reached 2,000 to 3,000. More than 300 opium dens have been cracked down on. As a result, the number of smokers in the city has gradually decreased, and the supply of opium has also decreased accordingly. Opium dens with smaller capital have seen sluggish business and found it difficult to maintain operations. Therefore, they inevitably engaged in illegal business and failed to pay license fees and taxes. According to investigations, when renewing new licenses this year, six opium dens, including Sheng Mao Yongchang, Lao Yufeng, Xieji Xingjin, Gonghe, and Zhabei Sanyi Gong, located in the Nine Acres area of the southern part of the city, have all closed down.</p>
<p>Strict Punishment for Protecting Smoking and Gambling</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau has recently received confidential reports that a small number of unscrupulous public officials are protecting opium dens, allowing people to smoke, gathering crowds to collect commissions, and profiting from them. Therefore, Director Cai Jingjun of the bureau is particularly resentful of these lawless elements and has ordered all sub-bureaus and district offices to conduct strict investigations and publicize this to all sectors of society. Once discovered, they will be severely punished without leniency.</p>

<p>Strict Investigation of Scoundrels Excavating Graves on Pretexts</p>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, because the demolition of graves in the Ningbo native cemetery caused disputes, causing panic among fellow villagers abroad, who repeatedly inquired about the situation, almost incessantly. Recently, the Yinxian County government issued a notice stating that all graves in the old urban area must be demolished before May 10, which aroused opposition from fellow villagers. Letters and telegrams were sent one after another, requesting a solution. On the 8th of this month, the Zhejiang Provincial Government was telegraphed to correct the situation. It is now heard that the association received a reply from the Zhejiang Provincial Government on the 1637th of the Civil Affairs Department, approving Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai Yu Hede, etc., a translated telegram, to request Yinxian to correct the deadline for moving actual graves and strictly prohibit excavation. The telegram was approved. It has been found that the relocation of temporary coffins and exposed coffins has been transferred to various counties to eliminate them and allocate land for burial as a result of orders from this government. As for tombs that have been buried for a long time, if they have been registered in accordance with regulations, they can be exempted from relocation. The so-called villages in Yinxian County often have scoundrels excavating graves on pretexts, which should be strictly investigated and dealt with. In addition to ordering the Yinxian County government to report the handling of this case in detail for verification, you should be informed of this approval, etc. The association, fearing that various fellow villagers may not be fully aware of the situation, specifically published the news in the newspaper, stating briefly that graves that have been buried for a long time can be exempted from relocation, and those that have not been registered can quickly register with the township offices in each area to comply with the law, etc. After this clear order is issued, all disputes over the demolition of graves can be temporarily put to rest.</p>

The next morning, after Yao got up, Hua Huizhen, a young girl from Suzhou who lived in the same place, came to Yao's room to chat for a long time. Later, Yao discovered that the legal tender and check under her bed had vanished, leading her to suspect Hua of theft. The two sides argued on the road, and bystanders intervened to mediate. At that time, detectives from the French police station arrived on patrol, inquired about the situation, and took Hua to the police station. Under interrogation, Hua confessed that she had given the legal tender to Ma Laosan, a native of Zhenjiang, who resided at No. 57 Ruichang Lane, East Zilaihuo Street.

<p>Shanghai's Straw Hat Industry (3)</p>
<p>Chinese Editor</p>
<p>(A Survey of Shanghai's Industry and Commerce, No. 20)</p>
<p>On the straw hat trade: Before 1926, the export of straw hats was entirely controlled by foreign merchants. All foreign export firms in Shanghai engaged in straw hats, with the British firm Anli Xinji, the German firms Lulin and Jiacheng, and the French firm Yongxing being the largest. However, the import and export of goods by foreign firms had to go through the hands of compradores, adding an extra commission and increasing costs and prices. After the establishment of Chinese export firms, because there were no commissions to be deducted, the selling price was cheaper than that of foreign firms. Foreign trading companies were happy to deal directly with Chinese merchants, and the number of foreign firms in Shanghai selling straw hats gradually decreased. Today, only Yongxing and a few others remain. Chinese merchants initially made profits, ranging from over ten thousand yuan for large businesses to seven or eight thousand yuan for smaller ones. After 1931, prices fell, and profits became meager, making business increasingly difficult. In November of that year, the Yuyao Straw Hat Company (located in Shanghai) went bankrupt, with losses reaching 220,000 yuan. The financial community became wary. However, general operations were still stable. Among the firms, Kunhe was the oldest, and Yingfeng was the leader. The organizational structures of the firms are summarized below for reference.</p>
<p>Yingfeng - Established in 1929, it was initially a partnership. The following year, shareholders Yuan Ludeng, Weng Yinchu, and Jin Zhongjian withdrew, and the business was solely operated by the Ma Bole, Ma Shenda, and Ma Shubo brothers. With ample capital, business was quite good and profitable. It also engaged in the export of pig bristles, egg whites, and fur. The address is currently 117 Edward Road.</p>
<p>Kunhe - Established in the early years of the Republic of China, it is the oldest in the industry. It is solely owned by Fu Qilin, with a capital of 140,000 yuan. It has directly engaged in straw hat exports for only the past ten years. It is said that the Ningbo Kunhe Straw Hat Company was established in 1907 during the Guangxu era and is also managed by Mr. Fu. The address is 19 Edward Road.</p>
<p>Ruihe - This firm was transformed from Huasheng, established in February 1935, with a capital of 20,000 yuan. It is a partnership between Wang Shenghe, Shao Jiyun, Sun Zongyou, and Feng Jiming. Feng is the manager and has ties to Lianchang. Transactions with foreign merchants still use the name Huasheng. The address is currently 149 Yuanmingyuan Road.</p>
<p>Lianchang - Established in April 1932, with a capital of 100,000 yuan. Its shareholders are the same as Ruichang, with Li Zuyin also holding shares. The address is currently 149 Yuanmingyuan Road.</p>
<p>Guo Huiji - Established in 1924, with a capital of 20,000 yuan. It is a partnership between Guo Sanjing and Guo Huichuan (deceased). Mr. Guo has branches of Guo Huiji in Ningbo, Haidou, Yuyao, etc., acting as an agent for Yongxing Foreign Company to purchase straw hats. It still exists today. The address is currently 505 Henan Road.</p>
<p>Huitai - Established in 1927, with a capital of 30,000 yuan. It is solely owned by Yang Wenlin. It has branches of Jiatai and Yuantai Straw Hat Companies in Ningbo. The address is 190 Beijing Road.</p>
<p>Huafu - This firm was reorganized on November 1st of last year, with a capital of 50,000 yuan. Former shareholders Zhu Xiangfu and Xu Xiusun remain, and new shareholders Cai Songfu, Zhao Zhaolian, Cai Qinfu, and Xie Junru have joined. Zhu Jincai is the manager. The address is currently 100 Beijing Road.</p>
<p>Hanli - This firm was established nearly ten years ago and is solely owned by the Wu family, with a capital of 100,000 yuan. The address is 467 Jiangxi Road.</p>
<p>Shanghai's straw hat factories date back to the late Guangxu period. Their origin was in Sanguantang, Hongkou. The products were crude, and the raw materials came from Luyi, Henan, hence the name "Luyi straw hats." After 1921, they gradually developed. Small and medium-sized factories were concentrated in the area around Miaoqian Street, Guangqi Road, and Dama Tou. According to a survey in 1931, there were over 90 factories, all small businesses. Some resold their products to larger factories, borrowing their brand names and trademarks to sell their products. After the January 28th Incident, many closed down, including Guanhua, Guanyi, Hualu, Shuangxin, Jiuhua, Wang Hengchang, Yuanchang, Yida, Ming, Lao Dingchang, Qiuji, Yousheng, Shen Hongchang, Shen Taixiang, Li Xieshun, Xie Kang, Jiang Wenhao, Jiang Linji, Huaguo, Huaan, Huasheng, Huaxing, Huatong, Guohua, Zhang Fuxing, Zhang Ruiji, Yixingxiang, Fuji, Yizengfu, Wancheng, Juchangxiang, Gu Tianchang, Guanmei, Huaxiang, and Xinhua. The larger straw hat factories are introduced below, which may give a glimpse of the general situation.</p>

After more than twenty years of continuous collection, he has built the most complete conchology library in East Asia. Some rare volumes were acquired during World War I, and even at a high price today, they would be difficult to purchase. The versions and bindings are meticulously researched, with an emphasis on colored illustrations.</p>
<p>Looking at the illustrations is like seeing the real thing. The collection includes 128 categories with over 2,000 volumes, including over ten complete sets of magazines. All British, German, French, American, Belgian, and Japanese scientific magazines are fully available. Some volumes span decades, making them specialized classics that are difficult to find today. Their value is estimated to be at least 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The Biology Institute of the Chinese Science Society is a pioneering private biological research institution in China. Mr. Jin visited Nanjing from Beijing and was impressed by the strong research atmosphere, the hard work of the staff, and the remarkable achievements in recent years. However, due to economic constraints, the institute lacked complete books and magazines. Mr. Jin, as a biologist himself, deeply understood the difficulty of conducting biological research without reference materials. To facilitate scholars' research and to support the development of private research institutions, he discussed the matter with the director of the institute, Mr. Bing Nongshan, and offered to donate his entire collection of conchology books to the library of the Chinese Science Society, for public access to benefit specialized scholars. In addition, he has set aside a fund, using the interest to continue purchasing various related magazines and books. The board of directors of the society unanimously resolved to accept the donation. They expressed their deep gratitude to Mr. Jin for his enthusiasm in promoting scientific research and supporting scientific endeavors. At the end of last month, they sent the head of the library, Mr. Liu Xianjun, to Beijing to arrange for the transportation of the books. It is reported that all the books have been transported from Beijing to Shanghai. The society, to thank Mr. Jin for his generous support, has established the "Shuchu Conchology Library Room" in the Mingfu Library as a memorial. All the books are being cataloged and will be compiled into a special volume, distributed to academic institutions across the country for public access. Mr. Jin's enthusiasm for science and his dedication to public service are commendable.</p>

Subsequently, under the advocacy of Chairman Lin and others, a proposal was made for them to go abroad for observation. It is now known that relatives and friends of the three sisters in the United States and Germany have repeatedly urged them to go. The three sisters have decided to travel at the end of this year and plan to take a thousand paintings with them for exhibition to promote artistic exchanges between young women in Europe, America, and China and to promote Chinese culture. Before going abroad, they plan to hold a pre-departure exhibition in Beijing at the China Road YMCA Auditorium and Reception Hall, scheduled to begin on May 1st. However, this exhibition will only feature four or five hundred works, all recent creations. Works previously exhibited in Beijing will not be exhibited again. The prices of the exhibition works will be reduced to commemorate their departure, with handscrolls and album pages priced at just over 200 yuan each, hanging scrolls priced from one to two hundred yuan, and many priced at one or two tens of yuan. There will also be one or two hundred exquisitely mounted square and rectangular pieces. At the opening, they will create paintings on the spot and give them to guests, charging only four or six yuan to show restraint. Chinese and foreign guests are welcome to request paintings. It is said that the sisters' itinerary will first take them to Germany, then through England and France, and then to America.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Further Hearing of Xu Qizhong's Case of Alleged Damage to Creditor Rights <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>After Wu and wealthy merchant Xu Guannan's son, Xu Qizhong, declared bankruptcy, some creditors, including Sincere Company, Sintong Motor Company, Shihe Jewelry Company, Jinjiang Hotel, and a woman named Hu Meiying, believed that Xu Qizhong's bankruptcy was due to extravagance.  They hired lawyer Yue Junwei to file a criminal lawsuit with the First Special District Court, based on Articles 154 and 156 of the Bankruptcy Law. The court has already summoned various parties, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Tan continued the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. The plaintiff's lawyer declared that the plaintiffs would all change to managers as their legal representatives and requested correction. They also clearly presented Xu's extravagant accounts one by one.  The defendant's lawyer then raised a question, stating that the implementation of the Bankruptcy Law was from October 1, 1935 (24th year), and all the debts owed by the defendant were before the implementation of the law. According to the principle that laws do not have retroactive effect, the case cannot be established. However, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that according to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Law, if there is any act that damages creditor rights within one year before the declaration of bankruptcy, a crime is established.  If according to the defendant's lawyer's statement, even if the most recent bankruptcy declarant has an act that damages creditor rights, the law cannot sanction them, which is greatly related to social security.  Furthermore, the case of lawyer Liu Fang suing Sun Chunsheng for fraudulent bankruptcy, the facts cited were also acts within one year before the implementation of the Bankruptcy Law. With this precedent, the defendant's defense is difficult to support and requested a postponement in order to present evidence. Judge Tan verified and decided to postpone the hearing for further investigation.</p>

<p>Lin Zhou, a woman from Hubei, had been working as a servant in Lei Xianglin's home in her hometown.

<p>Public Bonds Rise Three Hundred Points in Succession</p>
<p>Retail Investors Moved by the Upward Trend</p>
<p>Class B Bonds Rise a Remarkable Nine Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market situation became increasingly strong, and the rise became even more powerful. Various firms and retail investors were quite enthusiastic about buying. Multi-short swaps were bustling. The rise in Class A was only one jiao away from the highest price on March 4th. This could be called the second great rising wind. Some say it was due to the power of maintenance, but the rising market price is still a temporary struggle. Short side swaps were caused by the multi-party's price increases. The market price has risen for three consecutive days, and the multi-party has shown signs of emerging. Yesterday morning at the opening, numbers 10 and 48 were bought. Number 37 took the opportunity to swap to a multi-head, and the market price consistently rose from five fen to two and a half jiao. The impetus of the secondary market did not recede slightly, and retail investors were moved by the price increases, buying one or two jiao one after another. At the afternoon opening, the seed of this month actually led to a frantic rise of as much as five and a half jiao, and the rest also uniformly increased by two or three jiao. The firmness of the market was quite like a meteoric rise. As a result, the market price rose again by four jiao, five jiao to seven jiao, but the long-term Class B bonds rose by a maximum of nine jiao. The total number of transactions was 5,055,000 yuan.

<p>Three Qualities Rise; Standard Yarn Still Mediocre and Weak</p>
<p>The yarn market started high and continued low, and the situation is still revolving. The actual sales of current yarn are not smooth, and the period is still in the port, and the yarn in the yarn and cloth warehouse lacks mobility, so the industry is selling off. However, gold merchants and banking circles have never relaxed. However, the local yarn storage is slightly hidden, so the cotton yarn itself can still be strong.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Longs Emerge</p>
<p>The standard yarn jumped high in the previous market. The opening was slightly boosted by the good overseas yarn and cotton, but after the second market, it was heard that the spot yarn transactions were declining. A certain company's longs emerged, and although the amount was small, the market price had already turned downstream. The first Changfeng Shengjin, the result of each month compared to the previous day's tight price fell by 1.3.4.5 jiao, this month rose by 2 jiao. The afternoon opening market was still mediocre and weak. The second and third markets were driven by the gradual rise of Osaka's Three Qualities Yarn, but the face was still depressed and weak. As a result, each month fell by 1.2.4 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that 1,950 bales of Dafu, 350 bales of Dafeng, 750 bales of Yiji, 600 bales of Shenchang, 600 bales of Xingchang, 600 bales of Taichang, 1,250 bales of Xiacheng, 450 bales of Tonghe, 700 bales of Feng, 1,400 bales of Changfeng were sold, 550 bales of Tongji, 1,050 bales of Juxing, 600 bales of Mingde, 1,750 bales of Hexing, 1,300 bales of Senkang, 1,000 bales of Dachangcheng, 950 bales of Runkang, 750 bales of Xincheng were bought.

<p>The cotton market is slightly tired. Although the overseas Indian cotton market has rebounded, the local market does not believe it, because there are coarse flannel deliveries this month, and it is said that the delivery volume is about 70,000 to 80,000 dans. The market price is under pressure. However, the communication is still dragging into the wharf. According to a certain merchant, the inventory in various places is small, and the selling price has also risen by one yuan.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Tongji Still Buying</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard cotton market, although US cotton rose by 4 to 10 pounds, Indian cotton European exporters bought, rising by 0.75 to 2 rupees and a half, and Osaka's three qualities of cotton rose by 5.6 jiao. However, the market sentiment was normal, and each month rose slightly by five fen.

<p>In recent days, overseas silk prices have gradually risen, and the current prices of various goods in New York and Yokohama have rebounded considerably. However, due to the sluggish sales of European and American guests, the local foreign silk industry has not seen any improvement, and the user market is also bleak, and the price has also fallen. (The price of White Factory B, 20.22, is 740 yuan, which is about 60 yuan lower than before.) As a result, the market atmosphere is becoming more and more quiet.</p>

<p>The Supply of Powder in This Month Is Not Abundant</p>
<p>Yesterday, the powder market saw the same trend for each month's surface after the noon market, because the quoted price of foreign wheat in Chicago was 34 jiao higher, and Canada was 0 jiao higher. The foreign wheat market has been rising for several days, so although the domestic weather is still good, internal and external traders cannot avoid worrying. At present, the supply of chips in this month is not abundant, and the factory is trending towards contraction, so although the sales market has not been greatly improved, it is heard that the price has unanimously turned stable, which is 7.5 to fen higher than the previous day. By the time of the morning opening, this month was still trending steady, and the long-term transactions turned quiet, with few ins and outs.

By the time of the afternoon opening, it was slightly soft at first, but then it rebounded because the powder market was still stable. According to the current market value of new wheat, it is already high , and the prices of various commodities cannot be low and appropriate, so they will not be seen for a while.

<p>Yesterday's 客秈 rice market saw continued arrivals from the Yangtze River and eastern Zhejiang. Currently, there are rumors in the market about export bans in various provinces. Although a few counties did impose restrictions for a time to prepare for grain storage, these were quickly lifted and were not authorized by the authorities. Therefore, circulation continued in various provinces without obstruction. Due to sluggish sales and increasing daily arrivals, the market has been gradually weakening. Yesterday, sales in the local market were also sluggish, with total transactions not exceeding two thousand packages. Foreign rice was only four hundred and fifty-five packages. Although foreign broken rice is subject to full taxation, the ample domestic rice reserves have had no impact on the rice market. There has also been no impact on the market from dealers returning goods and closing down, it is said.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, various origins totaled over fifty businesses, with over ten thousand shih of goods arriving. The local market was sluggish. Package-selling Tianjin and Yantai merchants managed to sell over two thousand packages, further discouraging morale. The market situation weakened again. Thick early japonica rice fell by two jiao, and 晚稻 indica rice fell by half a jiao. Du Yangjian rice was also weak, with shade-dried Yuan rice falling by two jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, thirty-one or two businesses brought goods from various routes along the river. White japonica rice sold poorly on the market, sluggish and lifeless, and the market price was reduced by two jiao. Towards closing time, there was slight movement of retail sales. Besides early indica rice following by a small margin, the sales of thin indica rice were flat, with a price drop of one jiao and five or six fen. Yangjian rice was down by nearly one jiao, and Dujian rice was stable. Retail sales of dock-appearance Jian rice were sluggish, with prices showing signs of weakness. Shade-dried rice was down by a few fen, white Yuan rice was down by over one jiao, and all other goods showed signs of fatigue and weakness.</p>

<p>The skin market has been sluggish for a long time. Although bottom prices have not been significantly thickened, domestic sales have not shown a significant increase, so the market has remained weak recently. Sales of Eastern Zhuang goods have also been sporadic. Yesterday, the market quoted two yuan and seven jiao per unit, a drop of five or six jiao from the peak a month ago, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e197">Wen Xiaoyu <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Long Gonggong</p>
<p>Since that young unemployed blacksmith came to live here, Wen Xiaoyu has become a timid and shy girl. Her face is as white as paper, covered with many small red pimples. Her large bones tremble unnaturally, her voice is as low and tight as a sheep, and she often sighs without saying a word. When our landlords, who live by lending money, invited us to dinner, this young lady couldn't eat anything and even broke a spoon.</p>
<p>When she passes our door, her steps become more solemn. Sometimes she deliberately drops something, then picks it up with a red face, acting flustered... This proud middle school student used to only show me a face as stiff as a stone slab.</p>
<p>One Sunday morning, a week after the young blacksmith left, the weather was warm, the bone-chilling north wind had stopped, and the yellow clouds were leisurely sinking and floating in the sky. Wen Xiaoyu burst into my room, her posture as if someone had bumped into her hard from behind... she practically jumped in.</p>
<p>"Do you know what kind of guy the little blacksmith is?... Alas, you don't know..." she said excitedly, her eyes darting around nervously. "He actually expressed his love to me!"</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Yes, really. Although we live in the same house," she paused as if recalling something, then continued, "he often writes letters to me. We haven't really talked seriously. But a blacksmith writing letters—doing something so clever and capable—is quite rare!"</p>
<p>My surprise dissipated. I knew the young man had written her many letters, but there wasn't a single sentence about love in them. I asked her to sit down, poured her a cup of tea, and faced the mirror—which was a piece of glass in the window frame, with newspaper pasted on the back—to pluck my own beard.</p>
<p>"Did you promise to correspond with him?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Promise?—I didn't say anything. But... yes, that's how it is... he often hands me letters."</p>
<p>"Is he showing off his literary talent?"</p>
<p>"No! Look, he writes me letters about marital matters!" Wen Xiaoyu said with obvious seriousness. "I know what this young man is up to—a very simple intention."</p>
<p>"Are there things he wrote that you admire? This child is treated unfairly by society, but he wants to show his talents at every opportunity," I said clearly.</p>
<p>"I pity him," she admitted.</p>
<p>"Sometimes I feel that his life is very interesting, while mine is plain and tasteless. He seems to know everything, this melancholy young man, and he has a very good literary talent. —It's hard to find one or two like him in school!"</p>
<p>Before I could answer, she spoke again, confused and hysterically.</p>
<p>"In any case, he shouldn't have such thoughts so early on. He should admit that it's his fantasy. Even so, he's too fast!... Someone like that, no one would approve of me even saying a word to him... You know his character, he's very proud: I even told him, I said, 'You always mix in those colloquialisms, if you were a student, you'd know how the graders would scold you!'"... Yes, he is really prejudiced and stubborn, not like a young man..."</p>
<p>I asked her, "Why are you telling me all this?"</p>
<p>"You tell him, tell him everything—"</p>
<p>She said it unintentionally and stopped abruptly. At first, she had stumbled into my room unintentionally—that's how she made me feel, and now she felt strange. She looked around restlessly at our beds, the corner of the wall piled with washbasins, mouthwash cups, and shoeboxes, and other places. She had never walked into our room alone before.</p>
<p>"Perhaps, this is not very good," she said after a while, correcting herself. "There's no other meaning in me talking to you... Whatever we've said, don't say a word to him."</p>

<h3 id="e198">Spring Outing <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Jing</p>
<p>The decision to go to Longhua was made the day before the spring break, so it was very rushed. The process of deciding was actually quite funny. If the male teacher hadn't wanted to take the opportunity to play with the female teacher, they wouldn't have thought about the children in particular. Unfortunately, the female teacher didn't go after all. This clearly affected the short trip.</p>
<p>Of course, the children didn't understand any of this. When the teachers announced in their classrooms that they were going to Longhua for a trip, everyone cheered happily. It's so annoying to have class and dismissal every day! "I'm going!" "I'm going!" The shouts came from everyone's mouths.</p>
<p>The children in the city are really too stifled by the shops and smoke, especially these children from poor families. They can't see nature except for the sky, and even the earth has been covered up, so when they arrive in this semi-rural suburb, they find everything new and strange. Whoever sees a willow tree first shouts eagerly, "Willow! Willow!" Whoever sees a paper kite first shouts the name of the paper kite, or a butterfly, or a centipede, and the other children follow suit, shouting as if competing to see who can shout the loudest.</p>
<p>We arrived at the intersection of Dapu Road and Xukou Road. Originally, we should have turned right onto Kangxou Road, but the children insisted on walking along the railway in front. "There's a bridge on the railway, it'll make you dizzy!" I warned them.</p>
<p>"No, it won't!"</p>
<p>"Hmm! If you're not careful, you'll fall into the river!"</p>
<p>"No, it won't!"</p>
<p>This time, no matter what I said, it didn't work, they always retorted with "No, it won't," "No, it won't." What could I do? In fact, although the walkway on the railway wasn't as wide as the road, there wasn't any coal cinder rising up with your feet. When you step down, one step is one step. The children naturally didn't care about all this, they deliberately stepped on the stones beside the sleepers and crossed back and forth on the railway. They did such silly things with great pleasure.</p>
<p>The memorial tower for the fallen soldiers of the Fifth Division of the Army stood in front of us. An older child said seriously to his companions:</p>
<p>"Bow! Hey, bow! It's to commemorate the 'January 28th' incident!" He took off his hat and bowed three times, and several others followed his example.</p>
<p>Now, we stepped onto the streets of Longhua. The houses on both sides of the road were still houses, just like in Shanghai, but they weren't as grand as the houses in Shanghai. "Is this Longhua?" The children simply couldn't believe that this was the place they had been looking forward to.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Longhua wasn't just like that. The leading teacher first took us to the temple. There were so many people inside. And so many Buddhas. But there was even more smoke from incense and paper, filling every hall. In some halls, it even smoked your tears out, making it impossible to bear.</p>
<p>In front of the temple was the Pagoda of Gratitude. It was open at this time, allowing people to climb it. This became a place of joy for the children. They insisted on going up. According to the rules, each person had to pay ten cents to go up. But we received preferential treatment and only spent twenty cents in total. When we stepped onto the stairs inside the pagoda, I felt a kind of terrifying responsibility, "What if the pagoda collapses...?" Although we all came out safely, I always felt that I had taken them on a dangerous adventure.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Appreciating Camellias <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Jian</p>
<p>The children originally wanted to see peach blossoms, but when they asked others, they didn't know where there were any. Now, we only had the airport to see.</p>
<p>After eating! Actually, we ate light noodles for five cents a bowl! Afterwards, because it was still a bit of a walk to the airport, we first rested in a park to the left of the temple. There was also a memorial tower for fallen soldiers here, but the children didn't bow. To prevent the children from being thirsty, the teachers distributed some sugar cane to each of them. Because some of the children weren't full, they also gave each of them two beef buns. The impatient children had already bought willow branches and peach blossoms at this time.</p>
<p>As soon as we entered the airport gate, we heard a buzzing sound. A plane was preparing to take off. This was really good luck for the children. They shouted happily "Oh——, let's go see!" and then ran away, leaving us far behind. One of the older girls, focusing only on watching, didn't pay attention to her feet and tripped in a ditch beside the road, causing the workers who were mowing the grass in the field to laugh until we passed by.</p>
<p>The plane flew out of sight. But there were other planes being repaired in the field. The children surrounded them again. At this time, one of the children touched the wing of the plane and was shouted at by a worker, and the child looked very embarrassed.</p>
<p>Since the wings of the plane were not good to touch, their attention turned to the vast grass field. How vast. How green. How good for somersaults. They were tempted by it. Like a swarm of bees, they rushed straight to the center of the grass field. Unfortunately, they had only run a few steps when they were forbidden by the guards. They had no choice but to stare blankly at the grass.</p>
<p>Alas! What can we do to satisfy these children's hard-to-satisfy hearts?</p>

<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>"The Central Government is recruiting for the Navy."</p>
<p>After the Dean of Students announced this news he had brought from Jinan in public, the area in front of the office was crowded with people. Everyone mumbled something, smiles on their lips, as if a bright shortcut had opened up before everyone.</p>
<p>"Go away, go away, those who are tall, don't come!"</p>
<p>These words were like a gust of merciless wind blowing away the tide in front. The older ones needless to say walked away with disappointment, the ones who were about the right age but a bit taller complained that they shouldn't have grown so tall!</p>
<p>"Teacher, see if I can do it?"</p>
<p>Some children who thought they had a bit of hope, looked up, waiting for the Dean of Students' answer. Smiles and hand-waving replaced the answer. But they all clung on stubbornly, unwilling to leave, as if the land in front of the office door could be used to plant their hopes.</p>
<p>"If your height doesn't meet the requirements, it's a waste of travel expenses, you don't listen when I tell you!"</p>
<p>The Dean of Students spoke and picked up the cloth ruler in his hand. This ruler was merciless, if you stood in front of it, it could dismiss you without saying a word. The ones who were a bit too tall slightly bent their bodies, imitating inchworms, not daring to lift their heads under the black surface of the cloth ruler.</p>
<p>The cloth ruler was stern, many people failed its permission and walked away disappointed.</p>
<p>Opening eyelids to check for trachoma, showing arms to check skin, the Dean of Students was like a doctor concerned about the health of his students.</p>
<p>Checking and checking, only seven grains of gold were found in a pile of sand.</p>
<p>These seven lucky ones were from different classes, but they were all about the same age and build, if they stood together to compare, they would at most be no more than a head or an ear root apart.</p>
<p>They were enthusiastically busy collecting travel expenses, busy borrowing bicycles, to save money, they decided not to take the bus, not to take the train. On the morning of the day they left, the seven people lined up and walked out of the gate, clusters of classmates watched them go, turning back and disliking their books even more, feeling that their own future was even more uncertain. Picking up a broken lecture note, they hummed in a bitter, dry tone:</p>
<p>"Old nests are suitable for mud-carrying swallows,</p>
<p>Flying to the branches to become phoenixes!"</p>
<p>This small line of seven left the school gate, six people stepped on their bicycles, the smallest one, Linsheng (the most adorable child), clung to the back of someone else's bike as a tail, this day a yellow wind raged, dust like rain, pushing the wheels of hope towards the unfamiliar road a hundred miles away. These seven children were all leaving their hometown for the first time, Linsheng repeatedly asked the Dean of Students before leaving:</p>
<p>"Please, teacher, write a letter and tell my mother."</p>
<p>The students' envy for them had not yet faded, but this line of seven was suddenly blown back by the sky-filling yellow wind. Hearing this news, I rushed to the dormitory to ask them, only to find out that Linsheng was the only one who qualified in height, and he had also returned because he was afraid of being alone. Seeing them all covered in dust, sitting on the edge of the bed like a stone. The older ones had a bigger heart, and after murmuring, they still boasted to their classmates about the scenery of Jinan, and I also comforted them with the words "a blessing in disguise." Finally, I went to Linsheng's room, it was cold and quiet with only him hugging a thick quilt and sleeping, I woke him up and saw tears in his eyes. I used all sorts of words to warm his little heart, but his tears brushed my words off his face.</p>

<p>Hey, esteemed readers, hey,</p>
<p>This is a true story;</p>
<p>You can believe it as you read on,</p>
<p>But I don't know if it will become poetry.</p>
<p>"You need to breathe some fresh air, take some tonic medicine, Vitamin A or chicken essence..."</p>
<p>"Sir, I can only live in the kitchen lean-to,</p>
<p>I can only eat congee, pickled mustard greens, preferably dried fish."</p>
<p>"That won't work," he washed his hands with soap,</p>
<p>"The disease has already entered the second stage, without treatment, you'll only die!"</p>
<p>"But sir, what can I do? I only earn five dollars a month, and I have a little daughter..."</p>
<p>"What does your husband do?" He dried his hands and put away his stethoscope.</p>
<p>"A'Jin's father works in the countryside; we ran away because life in the countryside was hard."</p>
<p>"Ahem, then I don't know! I only know what kind of treatment your illness requires..."</p>
<p>"Then, sir, please treat me..." The hope shone in her feverish face.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes!" He sat down and wrote a prescription, gently placing it in Mother Wang's dry hand.</p>
<p>"What kind of medicine is this, is it expensive?" Her trembling hand nervously pressed her wheezing lungs.</p>
<p>"This is, this is a bottle of Vitamin A, a fair price, seven and a half dollars, the medicine is very effective..."</p>
<p>"Oh!" She was even more surprised than hearing about death, constantly coughing from her decaying lungs.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, I'm very busy, what about my consultation fee? Including the transportation fee, let's count it as ten dollars, a cheap price..."</p>
<p>"Oh!" Her heartbeat almost stopped,</p>
<p>Pressing her wheezing, her two frightening eyes bulging.</p>
<p>"Alright," he picked up his black leather bag and wanted to leave,</p>
<p>"What about my consultation fee?" He stretched out one hand longingly...</p>
<p>Hey, esteemed readers, hey,</p>
<p>I don't know when the doctor's hand retracted.</p>
<p>This story probably won't become poetry, I don't know how to end it!</p>
<h3 id="e203">Reflections Among the Peculiar Rocks <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Although the time seemed like a fleeting moment, the impression was very profound. I climbed to the summit of Tianping Mountain through the narrow, winding path between towering rocks. The mountain wind blew from behind, clouds descended from above, and rain lightly dotted my face from the side. I wanted to take a breath of free air, but the anxiety in my heart prevented me from such leisure. There were a total of four people, one of whom retreated halfway. Only three of us managed to reach the summit, and each of us wore a serious expression, carrying the same heavy mood. I couldn't discern their inner emotions from their faces, just as they couldn't understand mine. I vigorously raised the lapel of my overcoat, looking at the undulating mountains around us, which formed an oval-shaped valley. Pine trees followed the slope of the mountain, creating rows of varying heights. The branches of the pine trees swayed in the wind, seemingly welcoming our group. Their surging roars also seemed to intimidate us, as if they sensed the heavy urban air about us, knowing we were not those who lived within their embrace or resided on their fringes. We were strangers to the mountains, naturally not expecting any creatures to welcome us, nor fearing any to threaten us. They understood our mood. We advanced along the dark path, interspersed with sand that made it easy to slip. We didn't hear the chirping of spring birds, nor did any crows take flight because of our passing. Only a few hungry eagles in the distance, flying almost as high as the summit, emitted shrill and resounding cries that struck into our hearts. Their cries were certainly not meant for us. They were indifferent to us. We had such a feeling, but perhaps they didn't even have that feeling. Thus, we sensed their existence, but they circled alone and fiercely, focusing their attention on the task of finding food, without noticing our presence.</p>
<p>I admire eagles for their courage, yet I detest them for their greed and exclusivity. Although our great poets have defended them, "The wild bird does not flock; it has been so since ancient times." Although the Italian patriot and liberal Mazzini, in his famous essay "Goethe and Byron," said that Goethe and Byron were like hungry eagles hovering in the skies of the early 19th century, their shrill and disappointed cries shook the hearts of people on the European continent at that time (the gist of it, as I don't have the book at hand to verify). But the characteristic of our era is no longer personal inner turmoil, but the painful lives of the masses. The watershed between the past and the present seems to lie here. As representatives of the literary characteristics of the early 19th century, "Faust" and "Manfred," we can learn from Goethe's words about Byron: "This outstanding and talented poet (referring to Byron) will transform my Faust into himself, and extract from it an extremely strong nourishment for his melancholy taste. He has his own individual methods, his own purposes, using the power of inner impulse, so all those are not original, and especially because of this reason, I cannot but admire his genius." It can be seen that these two masterpieces have the characteristics of their common era. But I still don't understand Faust well. I don't understand German. I have read Guo Moruo's Chinese translation of Faust, Part One, and the English translation of the entire Faust, but I was not moved by them. On the contrary, Byron's Manfred, when I was still a simple and naive child escaping from that bloody world, closed myself in a small attic, and when I opened this poetic drama to read it, it gave my heart a tremendous impact. Especially when Manfred was dying, rejecting the sermon of the priest who wore the clothes of the dead, it aroused a reaction in the depths of my heart.</p>
<p>You have no power over me, I feel that,</p>
<p>And you will never govern me, I also know,</p>
<p>What I have already accomplished is done; I conceal within my heart</p>
<p>A trauma, nothing will be gained from you;</p>
<p>The eternal heart itself</p>
<p>Takes revenge for its good thoughts or evil thoughts—</p>
<p>It is its own beginning of sin and also the end of sin—</p>
<p>And its own emptiness and time—its inherent sensations when freed from this impermanence—</p>
<p>Gains no color from the transient external things;</p>
<p>But concentrates on pain or happiness</p>
<p>And these are born of knowledge from a barren heart.</p>
<p>You have not tempted me, nor can you tempt me;</p>
<p>I am not your puppet, nor your prisoner—</p>
<p>But in the past, I was my own destroyer, and I will</p>
<p>Always be my own destroyer. —Withdraw, you deceiving devil,</p>
<p>The hand of death is approaching me—but not yours!</p>
<p>If Manfred is the incarnation of Byron, then Byron, in my eyes, is respectable for his spirit of resistance, his unyielding character. The most annoying thing in the world is those vulgar and tedious preachers in black robes. They use deceptive means to try to exchange your conscience, to try to shift your goals, to try to use numbing drugs to temporarily relieve the pain caused by the disharmony between you and the objective environment. They deprive you of many things, but they never give you anything in return. In short, in order to maintain the dignity of the decayed puppet dug out of the earth and the sinful shrine placed inside the puppet, they will use any means. If you have self-awareness, a sharp eye to see through all this, and if you still have a bit of primitive courage, or the ambition to destroy this decaying puppet at will, you will see the priest in black robes, his eyes red, his mouth twisted, and hot steam spraying from his pores. He will present to you, one by one, the dogmas or moral laws left over from a certain tribal society, and tell you: According to a certain dogma or moral law, you should be punished; according to a certain dogma or moral law, you should go to hell; according to a certain dogma or moral law, you should lose your soul. If such dogmas or moral laws cannot convince you, then he will use the name of the puppet to say that you are a heretic, a believer of Satan, because you have two bright eyes, your eyes must be gouged out; you have two active hands, your hands must be cut off; you have a fairer conscience, your heart must be cut open; you have a tongue to convey your thoughts, your tongue must be pulled out. He even thinks that you have reached a considerable age and you don't have much ability to move around, you may grow a smarter and more excellent second generation who will inherit your thoughts and actions. So the most barbaric and fundamental method appears: they will eliminate your ability to reproduce. This method, which has existed in ancient China, is seen in the laws of a certain society represented by certain people in modern times who use science as a talisman.</p>
<p>Such sermons from black-robed priests, such barbaric remnants, are still the same in the early 20th century as in the early 19th century. We have not seen much change in the qualitative aspect, but only that its fog is even thicker. Although an explosive primer has long been buried on the social foundation of a group of deceivers, it seems that we still need to wait in time for this primer to produce bright and colorful sparks. However, what is pitiable are those Pgukustubes who have absorbed the toxic substance of the times. They think that it is right to use other people's flesh and blood to nourish those black-robed priests, and to get some leftovers from it. They advocate aggression, advocate slaughter, and as a result, the people of the world suffer from their poison, and they themselves and their descendants also suffer such a fate. The similarities between 1936 and 1914 are many. And what is most pitiable is naturally not those who have died, but we who are still alive. We who are still alive are too shameless, too unbrave, and too unconscionable. The poet Ralph Chaplin, who was imprisoned in Leavenworth Prison during the Great War for opposing war, wrote a poem "Mourn Not the Dead" which is enough to shame us cowards:</p>
<p>Mourn not those who lie on the cold ground,</p>
<p>Corpse next to corpse—</p>
<p>The silent and compassionate earth caresses all the dead</p>
<p>As all men must be;</p>
<p>Mourn not your captured companions, you must be detained</p>
<p>Too firmly to break free—</p>
<p>Each in an iron coffin,</p>
<p>Buried alive there;</p>
<p>Rather mourn those merciless mobs—</p>
<p>The timid and gentle people</p>
<p>They see the extreme misfortune and error of the world</p>
<p>Without speaking out.</p>
<p>We should have such courage to point out all the evils in the world. But what is the reality? If we look back and examine ourselves, we are all obliterating the truth and acting as the most shameless and base liars in the world. This has its objective reasons. To eradicate this reason, we must gather strength, which cannot be done by the strength of a brave giant (Titan) as expressed in the literature of the 15th century; nor can we fulfill our task by expressing personal inner distress deeply in literature. We must have great courage and advance towards a common goal. There are objective reasons for creating universal hypocrisy. What exactly are these objective reasons? Naturally, it cannot be fully explained in a few words. One day I heard a story. Although the content of this story is very superficial, its meaning is quite profound. The plot of the story is roughly like this: A wealthy man used a large bonus to reward a lie that had the greatest impact on society. As a result, three people all claimed to be entitled to this bonus. The first was the creator of the lie that had the greatest impact. Because he created the lie, the award should be given to him. The second was the spreader of the lie. Without him, the lie would not have had an impact, so the award should be given to him. This was also quite reasonable. The third was the preserver of the lie. Without him, the lie would not have been spread, so the award should be given to him, which was even more justifiable. Each of these people claimed the bonus and refused to give in, so the wealthy man had no choice but to consult a wise judge. The judge's judgment was beyond the expectations of these three people. The judge believed that none of them were qualified to receive the award, and that the award should be given to a fourth, forgotten man—society. This judge understood the truth quite well, and his judgment was also brilliant.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we attribute all the misfortunes created by the present society to individuals, to the specific greed of a group of people, or to human sin, to the impulses of individuals' hearts, we are distorting the facts and shifting humanity's goal towards the light. Spiritualist philosophers start from the heart, abandoning objective reality, and turn to the individual's heart in order to achieve peace and order in the world. I ultimately believe it is the fantasy of a sick person. For decades, Chinese history has been following a cyclical path, I am afraid it is caused by these vulgar philosophies. But there are still people taking hoes, shovels, and stone rollers to do repair work on this road, and as a result, I think their repair project will definitely be buried in the weeds, and the people doing the repairs will also die in the weeds. On the other hand, people who are unwilling to die in the weeds will naturally, based on their faces of not being willing to be slaves, stretch out their hard bodies that are unwilling to fill the graves of the cowardly, draw out the sword of fighting for freedom, and emit eagle-like cries, facing head-on the enemies who invade us, slaughter us, and plunder everything from us. The enemies are the supporters of this deformed society and share the remnants of the loot created by this deformed society.</p>

<h3 id="e204">Ways to Relieve the Spring Famine <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaoshan</p>
<p>"Central News Agency, Xi'an Dispatch" The spring famine in southern Shaanxi is severe. In remote areas, tree bark and grass roots have become the main food. The Provincial Relief Committee is raising funds for relief efforts and plans to raise 70,000 yuan to carry out relief.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Commission yesterday instructed the Hubei Provincial Government, saying: "According to reports, the famine in Yichang is severe, and there have been incidents of starving people seizing food. Please instruct to quickly provide relief to maintain order." In addition to instructions, please quickly devise effective relief measures and report them for verification...</p>
<p>People living in the fertile lands of Jiangnan seem unaware of the spring famine, just as they were unaware of the drought and flood disasters in the northwest years ago. There, tens of millions of disaster victims died miserably, and those in Jiangnan seemed unaffected. In Shanghai, we have never even dreamed of the tragedy of the spring famine.</p>
<p>Now, the spring famine in the southern Shaanxi area and the spring famine in more than 20 counties in Hubei Province have appeared again in a year of chaos. From the news in the newspapers, we can see that the masses in southern Shaanxi have tree bark and grass roots as their main food. If it is delayed any longer, we believe they will not even have wet clods of mud to eat. The same is true in Yichang, Hubei, where people are seizing food. For the sake of survival, order has been disrupted. The entire province of Hubei is also in a crisis of wind and rain. We will not forget that after the floods in the Xianghan Yangtze River last year, many counties in Hubei Province suffered autumn famines. At that time, there was no way to provide relief, and this year's spring famine will inevitably be ten times more severe.</p>
<p>However, this famine is not limited to the poorer provinces of Hubei and Shaanxi. The economic bankruptcy of many other provinces has not been a matter of a day or two, but a long-term and widespread phenomenon. Our authorities have indeed had many disaster relief efforts, but those are only superficial relief, not fundamental relief. We have seen from the past to the present that disasters and banditry are the same everywhere. The lives of the people have long been unable to struggle. Every disaster results in death or escape. Where to escape to? In the end, it is death, because everywhere is under economic bankruptcy. It is not enough to think of relief measures temporarily. On the contrary, it is completely useless.</p>
<p>Judging from the news, southern Shaanxi has reached a dead end, and the Provincial Relief Committee is only "planning relief measures and plans to raise 70,000 yuan to carry out relief." I think the Relief Committee should have tried to provide relief earlier. Now that they are only thinking about it, I am afraid that many people have already died.</p>
<p>In Hubei, the fact that people have fought each other for food can also prove that we do not try to prevent disasters in advance, and after disasters, we cannot thoroughly and practically provide relief. It is only after a long time that we decide on the old tricks of the past: "In addition to making every effort to raise relief funds and distribute them, we will also telegraph the central government to allocate spring relief and increase the distribution of charitable relief. We still hope that the authorities will provide fundamental relief measures to eliminate the crisis in its infancy and maintain the lives of the people..." We understand that that set of measures has been the same for many years, and relief is called relief, but famines continue to occur and are getting worse day by day. We are still waiting for the so-called fundamental solution until we die, but we don't know when it will appear!</p>

<p>— Muye</p>
<p>"Go... I'm not going; I'm sleeping here with you... little sister-in-law..." He muttered vaguely.</p>
<p>The shop assistants laughed again.</p>
<p>"What are you laughing at..." Saying that, she also giggled. She knew that he would do this when he was drunk, so she shouted at him loudly: "Hurry back, your wife ran away with a monk, you living turtle..." The female shopkeeper couldn't stop laughing, she shook her waist and couldn't catch her breath from laughing.</p>
<p>The man was like a madman, his terrible eyes filled with bloodshot, he slammed a fist heavily on the table, the things on the table jumped, and he pulled out a sharp knife from his arms. The knife "clicked" as he stuck it into the table, and he began to cry.</p>
<p>The female shopkeeper was stunned.</p>
<p>"Go back, let them send you back, shall I call a car..." The female shopkeeper was afraid that he would cause trouble, so she said softly to him, her tone seemed to be begging him.</p>
<p>"No, I'm not going back..." he said crying, like a naughty child. The shop assistants were happy to see the excitement and were about to laugh again, he glared at them fiercely. "...I'm not going back... I'll be angry when I go back... I'll be jealous, I can't wait to kill those bastards who occupy my wife... You don't know: you don't know: Ah! My wife is a..."</p>
<p>"What is your wife? Huh..."</p>
<p>"You don't know, she has to be held by others every night... I made her do this, no money, no money, hum..." He slapped himself. (The female shopkeeper couldn't help but laugh.)</p>
<p>"Okay, say a few less drunken words, company commander,</p>
<p>Drunken words, not drunken words! If you don't believe me, go and see, watching her being played with by that bastard..." He cried... The smile also disappeared from the female shopkeeper's face.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, he stood up suddenly, took out a handful of money, and rushed out without saying anything. The female shopkeeper felt as if a stone had fallen on her heart.</p>
<p>"God, I never thought..." Before she could finish a sentence, Li Dakui stumbled in again, he walked to the table, pulled out the sharp knife, and left the small hotel. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e206">A Lesson in Life <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Family Member</p>
<p>In winter, the afternoon sun always hid in the layers of dark clouds. The office of the agency, with several bright electric lights turned on, was occupied by more than ten people, but it was quiet. Everyone lowered their heads and used pens to write or copy, which made the sound of the pen tips scratching on the paper even clearer. The red fire tongues of the stove lying at the base of the wall crackled from time to time, always breaking the silent atmosphere.</p>
<p>A clerk with a square face, a mouth and eyes that showed an annoying, calculating type, lifted the thick cloth door curtain and came in. With the sound of his footsteps, a gust of cold wind blew in, which caused eighteen pairs of eyes to instinctively focus on him, glance at him with dissatisfaction, and then shrink back. The clerk didn't care and walked to the desk of the accountant surnamed Li in the corner and threw a large red envelope on the table with an arrogant expression. Afterwards, he stood holding his short beard with his hand on his chin.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" The accountant surnamed Li stopped writing and asked with a smile.</p>
<p>"You'll know when you read it yourself, official business." The clerk showed a contemptuous and impatient expression, as if he was very reluctant to talk to the other party, although he was one level lower than the accountant surnamed Li in terms of status, but his arrogant attitude at the moment was also not common. This made the accountant surnamed Li even more surprised.</p>
<p>"Official business?" The accountant surnamed Ji hesitated and glanced at the clerk before hesitantly grabbing the letter, tearing it open, and reading it. Suddenly his expression tightened, as if a criminal was reading a death sentence, so desperate and pale.</p>
<p>"It's an official letter of dismissal!" In addition to himself, two other colleagues were also dismissed. His fingertips trembled. He stared at it blankly, but he still couldn't believe it, and subconsciously read the letter silently again. There was no mistake, Li Haoran - his name, the three words flashed dazzlingly in his eyes, and instantly became three hammers that directly hit his head, more like a terrible muzzle, a ferocious demon, scaring away his courage and tearing apart all his hopes. Everything in front of him was completely dark, and he almost fainted.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, have you seen enough? Others still want to see it," the clerk deliberately raised his voice, which made him try his best to calm his confused mind.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>"Despicable!" The accountant surnamed Li watched the clerk's back as he walked away, gritting his teeth and cursing in his heart. "A job with a salary of thirty yuan a month was smashed for no reason," then he sighed softly for a while.</p>
<p>From this moment on, he was disconnected from everything here. He angrily dropped the pen that he had been using non-stop for ten hours a day for three months and wanted to stand up and walk out immediately. Yes, he was not qualified and was not allowed to stay in this room for another minute or even a second. Staying another minute or a second would make him feel more humiliated and embarrassed. Although in fact no one would immediately interfere with or drive him away, he felt that he needed to leave immediately anyway. But somehow, his legs suddenly cramped, and he simply lost the strength to walk a few steps. His buttocks seemed to be tightly glued to the chair by a sticky substance, and he couldn't break free.</p>
<p>What he was more keenly aware of was that a dozen colleagues seemed to understand the unfortunate and drastic change in his destiny that he had suffered in this short period of time, and as a result, there were a dozen gloating faces, and more than twenty faces that suddenly became very gloomy, with cold eyes, like arrowheads, all shooting at his whole body, piercing through his heart and piercing through his chest. He almost didn't have the courage to look up and look at the colleagues around him, no, now they were the faces of opposing enemies.</p>
<p>"Humans are cruel and have no sympathy" he cursed secretly in his heart again.</p>
<p>The office was still quiet, only he was listening to the sound of his mental balance slowly collapsing.</p>
<p>It was completely dark outside the window. Because there was a stove in the room, the temperature was very high and it was not cold. However, he was always trembling all over, and the blood in every blood vessel seemed to be freezing invisibly like ice.</p>
<p>Five o'clock struck. The colleagues all dispersed, and the room was empty, leaving only him alone. The handyman began to sweep the floor and tidy up the messy things on the table. He himself couldn't remember how he walked upstairs to the bedroom.</p>
<p>His mood was even darker in the night.</p>
<p>"Old Li, you don't have to be so depressed, what is a job of thirty yuan?"</p>
<p>A colleague who lived with him said in a comforting manner. Old Li only looked pale and stared blankly at the dim electric light for a long time without opening his mouth. Other people's words, no matter how good or enthusiastic they were, seemed to him now to be intentional sarcasm and ridicule.</p>
<p>"I've already lost my job, so what's the use of even if it's true sympathy?" he thought.</p>
<p>The clerk with a square face came in and said to him in a commanding tone:</p>
<p>"Hey, the director just said that it's best if you move out today, because someone will be moving in tomorrow." The title of Mr. Li was canceled.</p>
<p>"Is it impossible to move tomorrow? Uh, what will happen if I don't move today?" He was really angry. He said with great courage.</p>
<p>"It's always better to be proactive. It's boring to wait until people come and nag."</p>
<p>The clerk didn't face him, but walked out while talking.</p>
<p>He sighed heavily, and there were two puddles of clear water in the corners of his eyes, wandering and about to drip on his cheeks.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Good Flower Grove <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Mi Shan</p>
<p>Not far from our residence is a forest. All those who have traveled by boat on the Verdant Willow River and passed by our place know about this forest of ours. When those travelers stand on the bow of the boat, gazing idly around, they often exclaim in surprise, especially in the spring, when the forest becomes a cluster of flowers. The travelers shout even louder, "Beautiful flowers, beautiful flowers!" If it weren't for the river separating them, they would want to rush over there. – Once, someone almost fell into the water.</p>
<p>Most of these trees are fruit trees. Peach blossoms bloom in March, apricot blossoms in April, and pear blossoms in May. Throughout the spring, the air is filled with the fragrance of flowers. Therefore, many people traveling from Shandong to the northwest—they always go to the northwest in groups when the spring famine comes—must pass through here. Everyone doesn't have a name for this forest; they only sigh at the beauty of the flowers here, so they call this forest "Good Flower Grove."</p>
<p>Good Flower Grove is a great temptation to travelers – many people want to stay here and live. In the past, many more stayed behind. Some of them were very good at managing trees, making the flowers even more beautiful and the fruits even more delicious. Every year, boats loaded with fruits go downstream to exchange for unseen treasures. Besides fishing, Good Flower Grove gives us unlimited help in our lives.</p>
<p>It's not just materially; our lives in the spring were once as brilliant as flowers. Those young men and women like me all seemed intoxicated by the fragrance of spring flowers. When the moonlight covered the earth and the stars twinkled with happy eyes in the night, they would embrace and kiss each other like crazy, singing. They were all young people with boiling blood in their hearts, filling their veins, forgetting the pain that life had given them in their joy. No, there was no pain at that time. One of our female ancestors once said: "Love is like wine. Whether male or female, drinking it is beneficial. It can make people excited, hardworking, and brave. But, being drunk in the well of wine? You will be drowned." We young people believed in this saying.</p>
<p>However, the Verdant Willow River is a devil-like madman. It roars or swells its belly, making the vast wilderness all its territory. The houses we built with our blood and sweat, and our brothers-like, friendly cattle, sheep... were all swept away by its yellow mud wings.</p>
<p>This Good Flower Grove was also swept away by them.</p>
<p>It was a spring, when the peach blossoms were blooming scarlet red. Many young people happily called to their partners, "The peach blossoms are as red as your cheeks!" However, the river burst, and the endless water floated away all of us, and naturally the peach blossoms too!</p>
<p>We escaped the famine by boat, enduring all kinds of hardships. After the river returned to its course, we came back, rebuilt our simple houses, and continued our days. However, we no longer had that lovely grove of trees. Based on our experience, it would take four years to restore a small forest.</p>
<p>The disappearance of this forest seems to symbolize our lives: We no longer have brilliant days. Not only the old people are sighing in grief, but also the young people are like this—they have lost the sustenance of their springtime love.</p>
<p>We still think those travelers are better off than us. But, they told us, "The Northwest is not good either, understand? – Not to mention anything else, even children can't be sold!" Smoking a thick pipe, they seemed about to cry...</p>
<p>Some people began to plant trees, preparing to restore the spectacular appearance of the past – that brilliant spring, the symbol of spring. However, some people often sang a little song, saying, "Good Flower Grove is a place of happiness, restoring it is too difficult!" (Story of the Verdant Willow River, Part Three)</p>

Spring goes, spring comes, and autumn arrives again. The Cowherd and Weaver Girl joyfully meet. Pushing open the window to view the bright autumn moon, Chang'e tightly closes the Guanghan Palace. Autumn passes, and winter arrives early. Cold winds blow in gusts. The lonely woman fears the end of winter. The hateful wronged soul, in such cold weather, may not necessarily suffer loneliness.

<p>A scholar's feelings are worth half a piece of paper. One tael of silver provides for the meditation hall. He most delights in the blessed land of the Three Treasures. Meditating and listening to the Diamond Sutra. The cuckoo sings lonely by the ear. A traveler in a foreign inn feels even more desolate. Here is where the clear breeze and bright moon are unattended. Rest and sojourn in the Western Chamber. Sitting idly in a small pavilion, contemplating the principles of Yi. Opening a book by the firefly window, reciting essays. A pair of monks and laymen converse intimately. A maid walks out, dressed in green. To obey the command of Mistress Cui, she specifically sets up a ritual ground in the meditation room. To commemorate the death of the late Chancellor, she invites monks to pray for his ascent to the Western Paradise. On the fifteenth auspicious day, they worship the Dharma King. After speaking, she pauses, because she is a romantic fool who delivers rouge. Zhang Sheng comes forward and bows deeply. Elder sister, could you be Red Maid, the maid of Miss Yingying? I am Zhang Junrui, a talented scholar from Luoyang. I am using the monastery as a study for marriage reasons. Please report to the Palace of Pistil. Tell them I don't have a wife at home yet. Red Maid listens, her face changes. Sir, your words are too absurd. It is said from ancient times that one should not speak improperly. A reading gentleman is too frivolous. The old mistress is as unyielding as frost. No child over three feet is allowed into the main hall. What a maid hears can be forgiven. If the mistress finds out, she will be very angry. From now on, think before you speak.</p>

<h3 id="e213">Color Film "Revenge at Pine Ridge" Starring Shirley Vernet Set to Premiere <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>"The Trail of the Lonesome Pine," a Paramount production and the first full-color outdoor film in screen history, will soon be screened in Shanghai. The film stars Shirley Vernet, Fred McMurray, and Henry Fonda; the director is specialist Hardie Hatcheway, who directed "Battleground" and other films. This film is entirely natural color and natural background, opening up a new era in film art. The story depicts the combative life of the residents of the Blue Ridge Mountains of America, and interspersed with a sad and beautiful story of three love affairs. The plot is tortuous and the performance is profound. It is not only superior in beautiful pictures. Paramount believes that it is one of the best works of this year, which is definitely not without reason. It is expected that it will cause a sensation again after three days of premiere.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Boris Karloff Starring in Horror Film "Revenge of the Walking Dead" <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Premiering at the Great Light Theater on Saturday</p>
<p>Boris Karloff, who appeared on the screen in a terrifying posture, gained great fame after the release of the film "Frankenstein." Warner Pictures has recently hired him to star in the film "The Walking Dead," which is said to premiere at the Great Light Theater on Saturday. The film is based on the recent highly successful experiment in the scientific community. The plot extends the scientists' Nobel Prize winners, Carrel, and the world-admired Cornish's experiment of resuscitating newly dead animals. The scientific principle is the warp, and a bizarre revenge case is the weft. The interest is rich, the theme is novel, and the horror scenes in the film are even more than in "Frankenstein" and other films.</p>

Regarding this performance of "Peaches and Plums Competing for Beauty," Gu Lanjun stated the following opinions, she said:</p>
<p>"In the past, I have never taken on a role like the one that Mr. Li Pingqian asked me to take on. It always made me very worried. As for how good the results are now, I dare not say, but in good conscience, I have already fulfilled my due responsibility in acting skills. Of course, there are still unsatisfactory places, and of course, I hope that there will be progress in future works.</p>
<p>"Many people praise us for our good results. I only take it as an encouragement to me. I am determined to expect continued and greater efforts!"</p>
<p>That's right! We not only want to congratulate Miss Gu Lanjun on this amazing achievement, but we are also looking forward to Miss Gu's great efforts in the future. At the same time, we would like to recommend this "Peaches and Plums Competing for Beauty" to our readers.
