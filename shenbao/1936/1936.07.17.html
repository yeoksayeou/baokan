<h3 id="c11">內憂外患中之工業 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>我國工業處於特殊之環境。而又缺乏健全之組織。發展本不易。今則更有不欲與我共存者。藉提携為名。登堂入室。行其囊括之實。如天津華新紗廠因日紗業統制華北紡織市塲。無敢繼續投資。終於出售。又如柳江媒礦。因未克受政治之保護。已為他人所巧取豪奪。皆顯例也。準此以往。恐連固有之脆弱基礎。亦將全部動搖矣。</p>
<p>抑工業所受之打擊。不僅由於外患已也。亦有出於內憂者。如粉麥紗花期貨市塲之暴漲。與其謂為提高物價。造福工商。無寗謂為投機操縱。徒為他人造機會。期紗在此半月中漲十三五元。花亦漲四五元。然而實銷淸淡。囤積於倉庫中者絲毫未動。且聞全市存紗八萬餘包。日廠紗僅有六千餘包。以彼生產之富。而其存積之微。遠非華商紗廠所能企及。則操縱紗價。使之昂騰。非為日紗造機會而何。又如期粉投機。幾至不可收拾。而出於停市。及限制市價。多方仍不肯轉賣。空方亦無從買回。徒造成不死不活之局面。且引起日商向內地採辦小麥。雖其探辦。或為對澳貿易報復之一種作用。要亦由於粉價之狂掀。製粉業之原料問題。本患不給。自多一競爭。更多一困難。此又投機家所促成者也。夫以本業平準市價流通貨物之市塲。竟作業外人操縱牟利之工具。非工業腹心之患乎。在幣制未改革前。工業界以為一經改革。資金有着。復蘇有望。吾人嘗竊竊以為慮。蓋金融資本寬裕。能否轉注於產業資本。不為助長投機之用。一也。物價上漲。我國工商業所受之實惠如何。二也。而今固有不少工廠。依然缺乏資金。無術發展。物價雖漲。亦洋商出品所受之實惠為多。而金融資本之出路仍不脫投機之一途。聞倉庫中存紗多數為套利之品。從可知矣。</p>
<p>工廠業至於今日。已入危急存亡之際。舍自救外別無他道。而自救之道。要在集同業之力量。以抗外來之侵略。就歷來情形以觀。工商同業往往人各一心。排擠傾軋。是其慣技。臨難乃思乞靈於法律。期收統一步驟之效。蓋亦難。矣其次。新興工業每有微利可沾。輙羣起倣傚。粗製濫造。不策供求。不顧信譽。卒至一敗塗地。同歸於盡。而洋貨乃得再度重來。此類情形。亦不尠見。共三。資本薄弱。不自量力。擴大組織。終以週轉不靈。乞貸無門。而至失敗。其四。不求出品之精良。但知奔走鑽營。假竊名義。憑藉他力。以推銷其出品。此乃以政客手段。施展於工業。祗圖一時之利。不顧經商正道。何能謀工業之進步。其五。同業市塲。無法保持。外力侵入。轉為所制。失其平準流通之效。似此情形。亦數見不鮮。雖然。工廠業果能自身切實組織起來。痛改前非。而以同業一業之利害為利害。立定妥善之計畫。步步做去。金融業自亦能以抉助產業為其放欵唯一之方針。似此同舟共濟。以渡難關。我國工業前途。庶有一綫之生機歟。</p>

<p>— 家禾</p>
<p>人們把拜受組閣大命時候的廣田內閣，呌做「第一次廣田內閣」；被軍部干涉，改變組閣方針而成立的內閣，呌做「第二次廣田內閣」。如果上面的稱呼是對的，那末，「特別議會」後的廣田內閣，應呌做「第三次廣田內閣」。因為，「第一次內閣的使命，是對內肅軍，對外國際協調，充滿自由主義的色彩，而且組閣的參謀，尙是準元老牧野仲顯的女壻，現駐英大使吉田茂。第二次內閣」，顯然地受陸軍發揮「軍部武官制」合法戰術的掣肘，既捨棄自由主義的閣員，排斥政黨佔據內務省，尙與陸軍訂立秘密的口約：要改革政治的機構，要更高度地統制各產業部門，要提高軍部的工具內閣調查局的職權，要無限制的擴張軍備，要建立積極的自主外交；至於肅軍問題，那是軍部分內事，與外人無干。這樣性質的內閣，名曰「庶政一新，本質上就是急進法西斯的政權。若使廣田能够一一地奉行，則「二·二六」政變，不是失敗，而是成功，因為野中四郎們的靈魂，整個附着於廣田宏毅的身上。自然，那是絕不可能的。「二·二六」政變的發生，具着牠的歷史性；政變的失敗，也具着缺乏成功性的客觀條件。急進法西斯的登台，如果沒有客觀的需要，縱使三宅坂的少壯軍人，具有移山倒海的本領，也無能為力，所以，否定「第二次內閣」的行為，是必不可免的一幕。</p>
<p>廣田上台的使命，旣是繼續執行岡田內閣未了的任務，何以，他要和軍部訂立口約呢？理由十分簡單：按照法規，軍部大臣是武官制的。過去，無論那一位首相，不能於武官之外，推薦軍部的負責人，廣田自然也無法例外。再按照成例，陸相尙不是首相能够自由奏薦的，常先經參謀總長，敎育總監和前任陸相，所謂陸軍三長官的决議，而後交首和奏　勅任，政變之後的廣田，更談不上打破這個成規。處着上述前提之下，廣田的組閣，寗拉住寺內壽一，不肯受敎於荒木貞夫們，這不能不說是他的聰明。因為，寺內大將，不獨是陸軍內部所謂長閥領袖寺內正毅的後裔，而且是長袖善舞的伯爵。在關西財閥的陣營裏，他和宇垣一成，阿部信行兩大將，是可得相等的信任票的。其次，少壯軍人的政治手腕，在廣田看來，是相當幼稚。負着上惱聖慮之政變責任的他們，不努力於洗刷，只注目於訂立組閣的口約，把特別議會的難關，置諸腦後。殊不知議會的政治，既不能關門大吉，則議會的權力，不特可指揮內閣，還可以支配軍部。訂立口約是秘密的，而否定口約，卻有公開的機會，那廣田尙怕什麽呢？第三，軍人不能直接干政，載諸憲法。軍部要想兌現所求的口約，只能採取間接的手段。這一點，少壯軍人也十分明白。所以，他們和廣田的好，把內閣調查局的職權擴大為內閣中的小內閣，長官吉田茂（與現駐英大使是兩個人）昇為無任所大臣。但道個權力，廣田是沒有的，應待諸閣議。閣議是在內閣成立之後，到內閣成立，當前的問題，又不是履行軍部的要求，而是軍部和廣田，各忙着應付那特別會議了，特別會議所以然具有那樣的權力，不是僅為着握有一紙憲法的明文，乃為着日本的經濟中心，是操在資產階級的手裏。（地主和貴族自西南戰後，早已資產階級化。只有昧於日本歷史的人，方認為日本還有龐大的封建勢力。他們把軍部視為封建勢力，視為可與有產者扺抗的封建勢力，這也是錯誤的。因為陸海軍內部的分歧，就是有產者為爭割利潤而暗鬥的反映。殘餘的封建力量，是不足左右日本的整個政局的。）在明治維新前夜，大阪商人一怒，天下大名（諸侯）變色，就不說今日的三井，三菱，住友，安田們的權力，比前此的藏元」二扎差」，甚至「天下之鴻池，尙雄大萬倍；而軍部的領袖，也安足與封建的大名相持並論。為着上述的現由，廣田方毅然與寺內訂立口約，波過組閣的難關。</p>

<p>（倫敦）英國已正式援引一九三〇年倫敦海軍條約「活動梯」條欵、以便保留應在年底拆毀逾限、驅逐艦四萬噸、英政府昨晚以此項公文分致美日大使、轉達其本國政府，各海軍專家今皆以為最近外國海軍之發展、實使英國有援引此項條欵之必要、按該條欵規定、任何簽的國如以為其國家安全受非締的國建造新舰之重大危害時、得於照會其他締的國後、增加其噸位、而其他締約國亦可作比例的增加、至保留霍金斯級巡洋艦問題、現仍在英日美政府討論中、聞英政府對於該問題另有照會致日美大使、此項巡洋艦為霍金斯號（九八〇〇噸）·伊芬罕號（九七七〇噸）佛羅比歇號（九八六〇頓）、英政府對此三艦、擬予改造、或重置軍備、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）自英國政府、通告美日兩國、謂已决定援引倫敦海軍條約第二十一條「階梯式」各欵、藉以保存驅逐艦十九萬噸之後、美國政府卽當步其後塵、額外保存驅逐艦四萬噸、以謀對等、關於此層、海軍界人士對於英國政府此次所發通告、幷未提及巡洋艦噸位問題、實與本年五月間所發通告、不相符合、頗以為異、但仍加以好評、幷謂此舉可使驅逐艦額外噸位保存問題、獲有解决辦法、不稍失之含混云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（東京）英國保持驅逐艦四萬噸之條約超過量、决定援用遞補條欵、聞已將此意通告日美兩國、但外務省迄今尚未接到此項公電、近日或可達到、屆時當將英國之通告內容、移歸海外兩省協議後、卽可給與答覆、日本方面對於英國之申請、大致早已獲得諒解、確聞日方之根本主張如左、</p>
<p>（一）英國援用遞補條欵、則日本應取得之相當艦種、並無保持驅逐艦之相當條約超過量、故能取得潛水艦量也、</p>
<p>（二）潛水艦日本雖保持現有量、但倫敦條的在今年底失效、故與其從新造艦、不如保持老朽艦反適合軍縮之精神也、</p>
<p>（三）且日本雖保持其應行廢棄之驅逐艦與潛水艦、而大致皆係老齡艦、故不致給與英美以威脅、</p>
<p>（四）英國以為保持霍金斯號甲級巡洋艦、不得謂之違背條約、然關於倫敦條約第十九條之解釋、在日英美三國之交換公文、上巡洋艦分為艦種與艦級、甲級乙級有明顯之區別、故英國之主張、將甲級通用於乙級、作為同一艦種、實係違背條約之行為云、（十六日同盟社電）</p>

<p>— 本報記者　胡仲持　胡一臧</p>
<p>和這種藝術趣味同樣值得稱道的是日本人的禮貌和人情。這在神戶的旅館裏，我們就領略到了。我們是中國人，又初次住那樣的旅館，可是並不感到人地生疏的煩惱。旅館主人固然很殷勤很客氣，就是伺候我們的女中，（使女）態度也十分可愛。她雖是貧苦的農家女，却沒有一些組俗的姿態。她又大方又伶俐。她對我們講話滿口是敬語。她起初端了茶具和盛着神戶的名產「瓦煎餅」的果盒來，跪在旁邊恭恭敬敬地給我們倒茶。後來吃飯的時候，她跪着給我們盛飯，把飯碗放在木盤裏，像祭禮上獻爵一般地端給我們。進鬥出門，她總行個禮。晚上她給我們舖好了綿被，問明沒有什麽使喚了，才道一聲晚安走出去。</p>
<p>旅館裏的女中們屬於日木被壓迫的階層。她們那樣的恭敬有禮雖也可以說是職業的關係。然而根本的原因却還在日本傳統的道德習慣。日本各階級的人們無論男女素來是講求禮貌的。鞠躬總是四十度。語言上敬語也特別多。這種謙遜的禮貌所代表的日本的固有道德，連同日本的固有藝術是小泉八雲（巳故的英國文學家，在日本僑居很久）曾經用了最高級的形容詞讚賞過的。在今日的時代，這兩者還值得我們來稱道。這兩者象徵着古日本的，也就是和平的日本的精神；只有憑着這一種精神，中日兩國的感情才有融洽起來的可能。</p>
<p>然而可惜的是這可愛的古日本的精神已經發生動搖了。因為自從西洋的——尤其是德國的——文明傳到日木來以後，一種新的精神逐漸地膨脹起來，要排除那可愛的傳統的精神了。我們在神戶的旅館生活就使我們發生了那麽一種實際的感覺。我們正盤着腿坐在蓆子上，欣賞着純日本式的室內裝飾所表現的恬淡淳樸的美，以及伺候我們的使女的彬彬有禮的溫文的體態，領略到匾額上的題字所表明的一種幽閒和平的情味，忽地一陣隆隆的巨饗傳送過來，使我們住着的整所房屋震動了，所有的窗戶都格格作響。於是我們驚破了先前的美夢，醒覺到身在一個喧鬧的國際都市了。我們推窗一望，對面的高架鐵道上正駛過了一列急行的電車。神戶的高架鐵道完工還沒有多久。鐵軌舖在兩丈光景高的鋼骨水泥的架橋上，柱脚勻稱地排列着，中間可以搭造樓屋或是開馬路。現在這高架鐵道已經直通到大阪。從神戶三之宮車站坐特急電車去，只消二十八分鐘就到了。</p>
<p>像高架鐵道地下鐵道之類，巨大的驚人的建設工程，最近幾年來在日本發展得很厲害。這不一定由於工業發展上的需要。根本的原因第一是在日本帝國主義者的好勝心理。他們不但在軍備上要跟其他的强國競爭。就是在都市建設上，一見到紐的倫敦那些大都市有什麼驚人的建設，他們不管本國民衆負担得怎樣重，也非照樣來一套不可。第二是在近年來世界經濟恐慌的浪潮使日本各大財閥的資金沒有適當的出路。他們只得利用巨大的公共建設工程來消納過剩的資金，過剩的勞動力以及過剩的一切工業村料。</p>
<p>日本的物質文明從都市的表面上看來，的確到達很高的水準了。然而一般民衆在衣食住上却還只能牢牢地保持着極簡單的傳統的生活。在神戶的旅館裏，我們所享受的也還是那樣的生活。</p>
<p>我們在旅館的浴室，照日本人的習慣洗了澡，便換上了一套旅館特備的和服，回到自己的房間，那個房間舖有十二條蓆子，中間放着一張　几和一個炭鉢。休息了一會，女中搬進晚飯來。於是我們各自就四隻矮脚的一個漆盤吃着。漆盤裏放有各色各樣的碗碟，盛着生魚，烤魚，魚湯以及兩片黃蘿蔔，一撮半生不熟的靑菜。這些日本菜都只經過了極簡單的烹調，在吃慣了油膩的中國菜的我們，實在不大合胃口。暗紅色的生魚算是日本的美味，我們嫌着腥，給沖上了開水吃，才覺出一些滋味來。</p>

<p>— 中央廣播·講演稿　余靑松</p>
<p>各位聽衆、今年天文學上最重大的現象、能夠引起全世界的天文學家？物理學家、氣象學家的總動員、要算是六月十九日的日全食、在我們中國天文學史上來講、這次日食、要算最值得紀念的、因為我國派員觀測日食、和國際間著名天文學家共同觀測的、這是第一次我幸為參加觀測的一人、所以今天把觀測的經過和觀測日食的一般意義、簡單的和各位談一談、</p>
<p>我們知道日食和月食的現象、在天上不過是地球太陽月亮　體走到一條直綫上地位的關係、當月亮走到地球和太陽的中間、則太陽的光、有一部分達不到地球、就發生日食現象、所以日食一定在朔、（就是舊曆初一）當月亮影錐射到的地方、才發生日全食、就是太陽完全看不見、日食雖然必在朔、但是朔日未必都有日食、這是因為地球和月亮運行軌道位置的關係、至於日食的次數、按統計的結果、在三三六八年間、共有八〇〇〇次、這是平均每一百年間有二三七次的日食、其中全食的占六六次、這是就全地球來講、假定我國面積佔全地球一百分之二、則全食的中心落在我國的機滬、平均每百年內只有一次、我們再詳細的考查、知道從一五四二年（明嘉靖二十一年）到現在近乎四百年內、一共有過二六次日全食經過中國、從今年以後、一百年間、共有一〇次日全食可見於中國、但是其地位恰好能在中午見食的、在過去四百年內只有四次、在未來一百年內只有一次、如果還要求其經過黃河長江一帶人口稠密區域而且在本部的中區近中午而見食、則五百年內、只有二次、一個是一五四二年八月十一日（明嘉靖二十一年七月己酉）中午、日食在黃河流域、一個是一九四一年九月二十一日（民國三十年）中午、日食在長江流域、道兩次全食、差不多相距整整四百年、這樣的機滬、可算是難能可貴的、</p>
<p>日全食的時候、到底是什麽樣的現象、就是這次在日本北海道所看見的來講、當太陽被月亮漸漸的掩蔽的時候、太陽光漸漸的衰弱下去、當太陽快要全部看不見的時候、在他的邊緣一部分、現有極亮的光、好像金鋼鑽的戒指一樣、瞬時間此光輝部分、也就消失、太陽四周現出極亮的光芒、這種光芒、呌做日冕、這日冕的現象、每次不同、這次光芒、成為五角形狀，他的長短和太陽直徑差不多、同時在暗黑太陽的邊緣和日冕之間、有五個日珥、就是紅色的火燄、其中三個分列各處、兩個列在一塊、在太陽附近、還看見一個極亮的星、就是金星、這樣現象的有一分五十餘秒之後、就完全不見、日光漸漸又輝明起來、當全食的時候、全天的光亮、和滿月的時候差不多、但是滿月時候的光亮是白色、全食時候的光是黃綠色、所以覺得黑暗一點、快到全食的時候、看見很多的烏鴉都飛到巢窠裏頭去、全食以後經過二十分鐘左右、我們就聽見鷄呌、這是因為他們以為天亮的原故、</p>
<p>至於全食的時間、最長不過七分鐘、我這次所看見的有一分五十餘秒、約在六年以前美國舊金山附近所看見的全食僅一秒半而已、至於民國三十年九月二十一日、我國所看見的全食時閒、就一個地方講、最多可有三分二十秒左右、在如此短少時間的現象、全世界的天文家、物理學家、氣象學家、都要費了數十萬的金錢、不怕千里的辛苦、去觀測他、研究他的現象、譬如這次的日食、歐洲各國的天文家等大多數、都集在蘇聯的西部、就日本北海道地方來講、日本本國、凡是天文學家、物理學家、氣象學家、無論老幼、全體出發、共分為三十八隊、的一百七十人、政府方面增加預算數十萬元、其他還有外國觀測隊、除中國以外、還有英國·美國·波蘭·捷克·印度、等等在這樣短少時間的現象、為什麼要費了許多的金錢、驚動了全世界的學者、這是因為觀測這種現象可以供給科學研究的問題甚多、現在就其重要者來講、</p>
<p>（一）可以决定日月相對的位置、</p>
<p>（二）攝取太陽附近的天空、可以知道水星以內還有行星的存在與否、並觀察星光經過太陽邊時的曲折、可以供給普通相對論的研究、</p>
<p>（三）接攝取日冕及日珥的照片、可以研究其變化、</p>
<p>（四）可以為反逆層、光球及日冕的分光觀測、</p>
<p>（五）可以測量日冕的光强、</p>
<p>（六）可以測量日冕的輻射熱</p>
<p>（七）可以測量日冕光綫的分極性</p>
<p>（八）其他當日食漸甚時候、月影帶下各種氣象要素的變化、磁石的影響無綫電浪的影響等等、都可以觀測、</p>
<p>總之、觀測日食、不獨可以解决天文學上的問題、還可以供給物理學和氣象學的研究、因其在科學上的價值非常重要的原故、所以每逢日全食、各國政府多費金數十萬元、或特派軍艦護送觀測隊前往目的地從事觀测、並具若遇陰雨、則全功盡廢、譬如這次北海道觀測隊中、以英國隊的儀器最多最大、觀測人員在五月初就從英國到了目的地、經過一個多月的辛苦準備、不幸到了全食時候、因雲而不能觀測、我國所派到蘇聯伯力觀測隊也遇到同樣的不幸、</p>
<p>我國這次派遣觀測隊的目的、大約有三種、第一是攝取日冕、以研究他的光度愛化、結果攝取了日冕的照片三張、尚稱滿意、第二是為籌備民國三十年九月二十一日我國所見日食的參考、所得的經騐不少、第三是為增進一般民衆的智識、所以攝取了電影三組、將來可以公開演映、</p>
<p>六月十九日日冕時攝影、露光時間五秒、</p>
<p>中央黑圓為太陽、外面白光卽日冕、黑邊有白點處卽為白珥、</p>
<p>上為日本北海道技幸村專為歡迎我國觀測隊之歡迎門、下為我國觀測隊隊員、</p>

<p>勞働問題專家陳振鷺氏發表意見云、各國工人組織工會、初無自由、及到獲得自由、初則受政府之限制、後則其自身復由自由流於放任、出現自由的惰性、其結果、則工會之自由主義的組織、不得不改絃更張矣、歐戰以後、工會組織之自由、充分的表現其不規律、無團結、惰性與散漫、放任與無能、故昔之自由的組織、今則多易以統制的組織、如蘇俄之須在黨的路綫之內組織、意德之工會行動、須與國家意旨相符、法美之重視工人團體的交涉、皆其例也、</p>
<p>以言自由、初無可非讓、但自由而發生流弊時、則不得不救濟之、羅斯福說、「予以為自由之解釋、應為我人能使一般人民皆得較前更多之自由及安全、」此誠對於美國資本家所說的自由、予以當頭喝棒、畢克（Paul　Pic.）說、「自由的原則、應當放在社會利益之前」亦同此意、因為傳統的自由、已變為有資本者之少数人的自由、使大多数參加實際生產的份子無自由、自由已太受個人主義的渲染、而不顧社會一般的利益、此種自由、猶如普魯東（Prond＇hon）所說、「私產是盜竊」（Sa　Propriete　cestbvol）（註一）之方面、只見其弊、未見其利、當然應加以矯正、自由之極、將使其流於放任、散漫、無組織、如無政府然、經濟的自由主義、所以被目為生產的無政府狀態者、以此、自由之極、亦充分的養成社會的惰性、個人不知社會利益而追求、僅憑離羣寡歡之劣性而偷安、不具團體意識、自甘拂衆意以自滅亡、此種個人主義的自由、係走向死路之自由、若易以集團的自由、則係走向坦途之自由、二者應有區別、不宜以死路誤為坦途也、</p>
<p>最近上海市總工會呈請中央、將工會法第二十條「工會不得强迫工人入會及阻止其退會、」及第二十一條、「工會會員得隨時退出公會、」修改曰、「凡工會組織之同一產業或統一職業之工人、均應加入各該業工會為會員、」及「工會會員、非有正當理由、經公會准許者、不得隨意退出工會及不繳會費、」可謂係將工會組織由放任變為統制、由出軌的自由變為在軌道上受節制的自由、換言之、卽矯正工會組織之散漫的惰性與無能、使成為紀律上可以動員的團體、無論自原理上、說明、或自非常時期的實際需要上說明、皆可認為切當的建議、惜此建議、尙未蒙中央政府之採納、據行政院第七一三號批示、經飭實業部議復稱、「查工會法第二十條第一項及第二十一絛規定、係為防止工會妨害工人之自由起見、無修正之必要等語、此種根據、實不無商榷之餘地、</p>
<p>所謂「工人之個人自由、」應為「工人個人獲得安全之自由、」如羅斯福所說、自由應為一般人民皆得較前更多之自由與安全也、亦應如畢克所說、自由原則固當尊重、但此原則應放在社會利益之前」也、蓋個人自由之結果、有善與惡之二方面、善的方面、為其光明面、使工人地位向上、惡的方面、為其黑暗面、使工人生活愈陷於深淵、團家旣有勞工立法、其意旨原欲使工人得到保障、因是不能不分別工人個人自由之二種結果、善者可使工人得到保障、應保留之、惡者常使工人離羣孤立、被資本團體之各個擊破、各為工會自由、實為工人之自殺、應祛除之、俾與國家立法保障工人之基本意旨相符、</p>
<p>根據個人自由之理由、以反對社會利益之時代、已成過去、　者國家立法、保護童工女工、多有據引個人自由原則以反對之者、然國家立法保護童工女工之事、卒見於實行、團體協約法成立之初、曾受雇主之反對、其理由亦以個人契約自由為根據、然至今日、工人以工會名義與雇主締約之事愈多、團體恊約之憲章的特性愈顯其效用、就一般的言之、個人自由、初雖有其德行、但其後則變性、（註二）弊旣發生、不能不加以矯正、故至今日、個人自由之可貴、僅自由之善的方面而已、僅自由與社會莉益一致之方面而已、僅自由與保障勞工利益的意旨相符之方面而已、</p>
<p>準此以言工會法第二十條第一項及第二十一條立法意旨中的「工人之個人自由、」自不宜落於傳統的個人主義的自由解釋之窠臼、應採二十實際將自由作為社會的、多數人的、保障勞工生活安全的解釋、所以工會第二十條第一項及第二十一條之修改、如能增加工人對工會之向心力、提高工人之集團的利益、則修改為更嚴密的、有統制性的工會組織、實為貫澈立法保護勞工之始意、而日求進步、未可以件閉固拒而不納之也、</p>
<p>歐戰時、法國及英德工會、為民族主義所感召、帮助政府抗敵、動員無阻、以工會對於工人、能收如心使譬、如譬使指之效也、中國在此非常時期中、工會所屬工人之動員的訓練與準備、極端重要、非有嚴密的組織、統制的作用、在此間、將無以收統一意志、整齊步伐、指揮若定之效果、倘使下動員令而不能動員、則有組織如無組織、盲動亂動之結果、影響於禦侮救亡之全局、勢必不堪思議、此當及早預為之謀、則工會第二十條第一項及第二十一條之將平時的文句、改為非常時期文句、更於事實覺得迫切也、現上海市總工會、旣有呈請中央政府再議之事、甚望行政當局、立法諸賢、檢查工人組織之過去、重視時代之趨勢及需要、詳議工會法中各該條立法意旨所在的、「工人個人之自由、」而向其光明面着想、使中國工會組織、獲得更大的向心力、由有流弊的自由、變為無流弊的自由、由個人的放任、矯正為集體的統制、由弛緩的惰性、進步為緊張的幹的精神、</p>
<p>註一：普魯東說：「私產是公平亦是盜竊、」（Saproiteest　unematitution　de　jusitce　et　la　propricete　cest　levol）故私產自一方面觀之、雖無不公、而其流弊為不勞而獲時、則演成盜竊之醜劇、此另一方面的結果也、自由亦然、當初雖可貴、然羅蘭夫人說、「自由自由、天下許多罪惡、假汝之名以成、」在另一方面觀之、流弊所及、亦有不堪設想者、</p>
<p>註二：此實如物理上「量增質變」的原則所指示、個人自由之適度、固有德性、但個人自由之過度、則有惡性矣、</p>

<p>年來日本驅逐我國留東華僑、何止數千人、幾致每一船到上海、必有一二華僑逐回、赴日華人同時亦嚴加限制、如在日經商之僑胞、欲往該國、必先出示離日　歸國時　日水警所給發</p>
<p>許可上陸</p>
<p>證書、方准其買票上船、否則卽不許乘輪、又有赴日中國小商及華人店夥、如理髮料理等）在赴日時、亦必預繳一百元證金、留存與日輪公司、如果到日本時、日當局不准該客上岸、而押令返中國者、卽在此預存之證金內扣除船費等項、此項事實、已數見不鮮、滬上日輪公司、近忽接到日本電令、着</p>
<p>禁止閩人</p>
<p>乘船往日、其理由大致以福建籍華人、無論業工商者、到日本均無固定職業、而且此項閩籍華人在上海乘船者、十之八九係到門司上陸為多、今次禁止閩籍赴日、係不論工商業、槪不許售船票、卽槪行禁止其到門司、唯恐或有閩人偽充他省籍、而轉到其他港岸上陸、混入日境者、故在日輪上、特增添</p>
<p>旅客檢查</p>
<p>聞每一日輪、派有三人、對於乘三等艙之赴日華人、在船須經三次盤詰、問答均記錄冊簿內、如三次查盤、答詞稍有不符、便不准該客入境、須押逐回華、其嚴厲精密可稱無微不至、本埠日輪社已經遵照日本來電、拒乘往門司之閩籍華人矣、從此福建籍之工商業人赴東十分困難也、</p>

<p>昨日各路珍眉、因高者無多、而次者要　大高之故、市面頓轉清淡、惟低荘秀眉恊和有百餘箱進辦、價十六元、及土荘抽珍錦隆天裕各有百箱成交、價八十八元至九十四元、其餘各路珍眉交易殊覺靜寂、平水大帮錦隆等行仍略有辦胃、秀清茶萬年青祿字各帮均先後成交、批價仍與前相仿、該路中次檔秀眉、恊和杜德各有二百箱辦進、價十六元至廿元、至祁寗紅茶、昨市怡和恊助會等行、對於花香末片等項、進意尚殷、但正貨銷路、較前略為呆滯云、</p>

<p>昨日棉布市情、因標紗花及外棉繼續下挫、而先前狂驟時、各客帮及本街雖大事吸收、而實際交易並無起色、故號家手貨與一部份染廠多餘坯布額子、均頗有意走銷、粵帮因時局不靖以前所吸巨額本廠細斜、照目下市面每疋尚有三四角盈利、現均在滬轉出、致市面經此數重壓力、雖廠盤依然堅實、而趨勢頓形疲弱、本貨細布·細斜跌但他每疋五分至一角、市布八四跌每疋一角、本廠細斜跌一角至二角、漂布跌一角、本廠細布·粗布·粗斜、因前次漲勢緩和、細布現貨缺乏、故售盤均未更改、各路客帮及本街各布添貨均大形减缩云、</p>

<p>昨逢元芳二九九八次拍賣、陳列各貨計二十六牌二十六箱、市况頗形活躍、加呌三俠一色天兩牌泰西緞、因久未列入、業中爭購、故價獨秀、羽綢加入竹林東華兩牌、價亦堅俏、市價泰西緞較上期每碼好一二分、元絨升二角半、直賣呢亦漲三分、元羽綢十八牌彩八士九連燈愉雲牌皆漲六角、其餘皆升二三角、洋紅布呌八磅價亦挺秀、洋藍布祇女民軍一牌下遜一角云、</p>

<p>派力司日來銷塲暢達、棧存缺乏、因之又見續漲、怡和申織派力司每碼雖出價至二元九角、尚不易搜得、且顏色俱皆殘缺不齊、伊藤久孚永豊諸日貨、店方尚有存貨、洋行現貨早已斷檔、昨快發財派力司、門市零剪均非沽國幣三元四角不可辦到、久孚伊藤為三元六角、西貨最低價須四元四角、下檔貨上週已告馨、</p>

<p>昨日期麦市面、上午开盤後、各月份呈初漲繼平、後復轉穩之象、以洋麦報價、芝加哥回漲七八角不等、坎拿大漲五六七角不等、當開價時、因洋麦之回漲、人心見穩、較之前日大致穩定、因洋麦之回漲、人心見穩、較之前日大致穩定、後以多頭逐步脫手、又稍回落、迨至下午開盤、七月份回廠方擯住現貨、市面仍平、交易亦少、遠期各月份交易雖亦清淡、因洋麦究屬報漲、未免抬住、較前日計好一三分不等、觀察後步、如投機减退、市面當能步入正途矣、現麦市面見交不暢、廠方祗略動辦胃、趨擯局、開明光沙河集羊河張八嶺麦四元五角三分、計二千包、由福新辦去云、</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各份市面、依然停寂、市塲正式交易為數甚少、且大部分均係了結、新買賣無從談起、至所傳之暗盤、本月份籌碼較缺、并以洋麦之回漲五六七八角不等、喊價微升、大約五六分之間、惟八月份頗濫、則祇一二分之間云、</p>

<p>昨客秈到頭仍旺、因湘贛產價廉宜、且有减去捐税照费之举、今後到源当可繼續活潑、到頭旺而銷化反細、市面因此逐步疲落、且本客有實銷胃口者、以米市連日步趨而下、辦後卽小、不敢問津、去化一呆、市面更見不支、昨日本街續有應酬外、內地帮中次機早晚之問訊、北洋帮亦辦去湘油米五百十包、市形始轉定勢、全日開出贛米三千一百五十包、湘米一千五百十包、皖米二百包、除客化一千數百包外、盡係本街辦去云、</p>

<p>首批蘭竹枝昨已見樣、以身色較遜、開價不滿三十元、行家購進後、尚須加以選剔、售盤自必增高、鳥葉枝早紅枝與前相仿、次荘稍减、據產價合劃均須虧本、後市地頭當有隨鬆之望、</p>

<p>昨日天雨、五金交易冷落、各貨開出祗英鋼板三百擔、白鉛皮二十桶、瓦楞鐵白鐵絲各二百餘扎、其他則新鐵絲馬口鐵會司鐵小分釘本廠釘等皆有少數交易、行情白鐵皮因海外連電報跌、所以申市亦見下降、如二號每桶售一百四十元、三號一百三十四元、四號一百三十二元、五號一百二十八元、六七號一百二十七元、八號以上至厚花色則開一百二十三四元、增色比前小去五角至一元半不等、至海外行情、每噸價沽十七鎊十先令、比前小十先令、聞同業做進定貨有三四百桶之多、預料來日市價、仍有下跌之憂、此外舊鐵等市價因交易不多、故市無軒輊也、</p>

<h3 id="c178">紅鼻子 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>眞有點意外的，在古老的護龍街上一間半開間門面的小屋裏，偶然地又看到那個紅鼻子的壯大大老漢，傻坐在門口吸水烟，看守一個小糖食攤子。</p>
<p>使我有點詫異，紅鼻子竟那麼改樣子了。</p>
<p>七八年前，我在中學校念書，有一個時候，跟幾個同伴全很有興致的學習刻印章，每逢星期六星期日，就幾個同學一起上護龍街的收賣舊文物的舖子去買些便宜的刻印石。那時紅鼻子老漢子在護友街的另一地帶開着很像樣的古玩舖，門口排着玻璃櫃　，收藏的古物很多；我們時常到他的店裏去買印石，他收集的印章石頭比其他的舖子全多，然而紅鼻子的脾氣很不好碰，向他去買東西，時常要受他一套氣派的說話。</p>
<p>我們只買些十多個銅元一塊的劣等石頭，然而紅鼻子時常以為這樣的小生意是跟他胡擾，有時故意把二三元錢一塊的石章拿出來，同時跟我們說幾十元一方的全有；翻着如蕃茄似的紅臉，紅鼻一嗅嗅的，把手指頭在面頰左邊的一個紅肉塊上一下下的揑着；睜大着　颗綱滿了紅絲的眼珠子，兩片紫紅唇一顫一顫的，很不耐煩似的老是打我們說：</p>
<p>—麻煩，麻煩，儘是買那麼價廉的，要好的，買兩元五角一塊，眞的好印石。</p>
<p>我們凡事是經常地到他店裏去胡擾，老是跟他做一毛錢左右的小生意，他的說話氣派始終看不起我們，有幾次踏上去，他只管一個兒吸水烟，不睬我們，向他招呼後，覺到不耐煩地嗅動着红鼻子把一些最劣等的硬石頭拿出來。</p>
<p>以後我們不願再去碰他大脾氣了。一則為學校課程忙，沒空時間去分心到那些小趣味上；二則化了不少錢，學刻的成績並沒進步，而且畢業考逼在眼前，畢業後的生路問題又無法解决，於是再没有閑適的心境來用心在刻石的小趣味上了。</p>
<p>從此我們不再上紅鼻子的古玩舖，偶而經過他舖子前，　瞧見他一個兒在玻璃櫃檯裏悠然地吸烟。</p>
<p>走出中學之後，為生活在社會上茫然的摸索着，好多年来，哀愁與悲憤塡滿着必胸，當年學習刻印章的心情是早沒有了。</p>
<p>携着失業的哀悉愁，回到古城來，意料外的竟又看到了那個紅鼻子。想不到那個大牌氣的古玩舖老板，現在也如此沒落了。像親的古玩舖已倒閉，搬到那麼半開間的小屋裏來，紅鼻子　給生活攻倒了，竟改做起擺糖食的小攤生意來了。</p>
<p>在那個糖食攤子邊，我惘然的站停了一回，紅鼻子也許已不認識我，他那裏知道我也携着被生活攻倒的哀愁回古城來的呵！</p>

<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>才交了初春。</p>
<p>接連下過幾天雨，西北風一吹，放晴了，給鷄鴨踐踏過的晒榖塲上，全是一個個脚爪印；低潌　地方，還積着水，河里也是滿滿的。</p>
<p>靠近埠頭，一只船帶着纜。老金水站在埠頭上，正在打發他的兩個兒子，把畚箕，土笥，釘耙，掃帚等等拚土的用具，拿下船去，他們今天打算到鎭上去畚拉圾。</p>
<p>村上種田的人家，每年要在田里下一點肥料，肥田粉是用不起的，便是人糞也還要嫌太貴，他們常用的肥料是垃圾灰，那就是把垃圾堆成座小山，放一把火，這樣煆上六七天，都煆成灰了，用業壅田，這才是頂頂便宜的肥料。但村上大都是務農的，窮困的人家，照例捨不得把東西丟棄，因此垃圾也不多，就只好往鎭上拚。</p>
<p>用具放定當後，船便撑開了岸。</p>
<p>造近河塘的水面上，薄薄地結了一層冰。三寶把着櫓，四喜和老金水坐在船頭上。船身輕，河水大，一側一側的，顚簸得很利害，有時船身逼近河塘去，冰片擦着船沿，發出瑟瑟的聲音來。</p>
<p>從村里　鎭上，打水路去，是要一個悠長的時間的。老金水一面吸着烟，一面閑談着，他那乾　的臉上，刻着一條條痕路，說明了他的辛苦的經歷，是一張偉大的履歷表。</p>
<p>船　是個醉漢，踉踉蹌蹌地向前進。老金水談得挺起勁。</p>
<p>「得！那時候你們還是小孩呢！阿寶還只四歲，你還在吃乳，是宣統元年，那年的太陽毒得眞利害，田里的裂縫有尺把圖，災荒鬧得和去年一樣兇。」</p>
<p>老金水的話到這里頓了頓，啵啵地吸了幾口烟，又接下去：</p>
<p>「但第二年却是好年成，早稻長得半身高，足足收了四袋多，上下兩季，補過第一年的捐失。我就在這一回翻了頭。</p>
<p>二寶停止了搖拽，讓船在水面上淌。他聽得幾乎出了神，竟沒有注意對面的來船，及等聽到「來船靠邊」的喊聲時，已經來不及扳，兩只船就重重地碰了一下。聽着對面稍公約咕嚕，船就各自分道了。</p>
<p>「要這樣，今年也該埃到好年成了？」四喜　。</p>
<p>「是的，老話頭說得好：『頭八晴，好年成！』今年的頭八是好天氣。而且去年還下了一冬雪。」</p>
<p>希望的火熖然燒着老金水的心，燃燒阒三寶的心，四喜的心。幸福如同春草一樣，在這死寂的，灰色的原野里萌了芽。</p>
<p>「倘能這樣，我們得自己買頭牛，免得向這家那家借，出了錢還要看面孔。」三寶提議。</p>
<p>「而且，我也得做一套和哥哥樣的白洋布短衫褲。」四喜也說出了自己想望已久的心願。</p>
<p>老金水笑了笑。吓！吓！吓！在船沿上敲出了烟斗里的灰，重新装進烟去，吸了起來。他的兩眼里包含着熱望的光輝，像一個正在等候着情人的青年所有的一樣。他是那親地迫切，而又那樣地充滿着快樂的預感，簡直完全忘記了去年的災難，忘記了挨餓挨冷的日子。</p>
<p>三寶脫去了短棉襖，使勁搖起來。太陽慢慢地升高，船也一櫓一櫓的更近了目的地。</p>
<p>到得鎭上，已經是晌午辰光了。賣鮮貨的早已散了市，街路是潮濕的。父子們三個，就在船里吃了點帶來的乾糧。拿着拚具，跳上了岸。</p>
<p>鎭上的店家，好幾家關着門，有的貼着尺把轉方的大紅紙，有的又着白底黑字的十字條。但大金數還開着。店伙們靠着櫃檯，　閑地望着街上的行人。全鎭有兩條街，前後百來爿店。逢着單數的日子，四鄉農民都到這里來趕市，近海的漁家，也帶些鮮貨來，換得錢，終有些生意下顧到這些店家的頭上。但這幾年來，店家在農民們的眼里，謁變成了陳列所，他們嚴守着「只許參觀，不准動手」的信條。他們什麼也不買，因為買不起。</p>
<p>店家的生意一清淡，就越發想吸引買主。門前掛上大减價的旗兒，打着鑼鼓，鑼鼓的聲音里傳達出凄凉空虛的調子，不過驟然聽來，却還是熱鬧的。</p>
<p>這熱鬧使三寶和四喜覺得有趣，他們一邊挑垃圾，一邊觀賞，像觀着二月里的城隍會一樣。洋貨店的櫉窗里，放着精緻的家用東西；點心店里時時傳出旅人涎沫的香味來；洋布店里掛着各种衣料。四喜想到只要一等到秋初，自己就可以在这上面挑一件上好的衣料时，肩上的垃圾担陡的輕了起來。</p>
<p>老金水嘴裏催促着，心裏却也十分高興。他的高興原因，是因為下過幾天雨，上鎭來拚垃圾的並不多，所以垃圾積得非常高，往年終要一家一家地挨望去問，這一次却拚來就是，非常順手。這順手彷彿預言了今年的年成。飽暖，豊足，老金水已經望見了自己重新翻頭的日子。</p>
<p>因為　裝得多一點，及到傍晚辰光，這才滿滿地裝了一船。疲倦的身體包裹着兴奮的心，他們洗凈手，脚櫓子撥動河水，就這麼打了回程。</p>
<p>垃圾是滿滿的，這裏面有煤屑，有破布，有牲畜的骨骼，有魚類的鱗甲，這些東西，煆成了灰，用來壅田，對於禾類是十分滋養的。牠能夠使田禾很快地長起來，結成了纍纍的榖　一粒一粒的，可以換錢，置牛，剪洋布衫褲，由些起家的黃金色的榖。</p>
<p>這滿船的垃圾，這滿船的希望。</p>
<p>把櫓的依舊是三寶，老金水啣着烟斗，坐在船頭上，眼睛望着在岸上拉　的四喜的背影。西山上的殘霞，帶着一抹红光，慢慢地褪下去。大家因為在中午只吃了一點乾糧，又經過番勞作，肚子咕嚕呌起來，歸心就特別急。可是垃圾是經過雨霖的，份量十分可觀，船身吃水越重，越是搖不快，肚子也越是呌得利害。</p>
<p>「我餓得荒！」二寶說。</p>
<p>「為了將來的飽喛。你且耐一耐，」老金水放下烟斗，「今年的垃圾又多又好，壅在田裏，凖是好年成！」</p>
<p>「早該多帶些點心，還有燈籠。你看，天色已經黑下來！」</p>
<p>三寶一面說，一面就提起精神，大櫓的搖起業，船身開始向左右側動。這力量從縴繩裏一直傳給了在岸上的四喜，他也加緊地拉。船果然快了一點。船頭的浪花高高地濺上來，像十萬顆明珠在跳躍。</p>
<p>老金水疲倦得閉上兩眼，想打盹。</p>
<p>雖然已經過了大半程路，天色却越發昏暗了，灰藍的天面上釘着幾顆疎星。遠處的村落，沒入迷濛的夜色裏，初春的空氣是靜寂的。三寶盡力搖着櫓。船岙離開水面最近的地方，本來不過二三寸，這時候一經側動，水便一口一口地溢進來。飢餓使人躁急，疲倦使人疎忽，昏夜蒙住了人們的眼睛，蒙住了人們的良知。</p>
<p>岸上的四喜覺得縴繩一步重似一步了，但他還以為白天太辛苦，自己感到了疲乏的緣故。於是就拿出全身的力量，拚命地拉，沒走上幾步路，「拍」的一聲，縴繩斷了，四喜一直往前衝。</p>
<p>「阿呀！」三寶呌了起來。</p>
<p>老金水吃了一驚，睜開眼來，只看見白茫茫一的片。船頭和船尾還露在水面上，但中艙裏的垃圾，已經吃飽了水，牠帶着榖，帶着牛，帶着白洋短衫褲，帶着豊足，館暖，帶着這父子們三個的希望，和這只船一道，慢慢地沈下去了。</p>
<h3 id="c180">海燕 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 錫金</p>
<p>——一月二十日重讀高爾基詩</p>
<p>海燕又在天上飛，</p>
<p>拍一拍雙翅忽地騰起；</p>
<p>一聲呼呌悠長而嘹亮，</p>
<p>一個亮的身影，穿過了天空，</p>
<p>倒映入陰暗的深黝的海中……</p>
<p>狂風吼起在水上，</p>
<p>翻騰起滔天的巨浪：</p>
<p>大雨擊落軟弱的白鷗，</p>
<p>天際的鳥雲推轉，輾軋出</p>
<p>千條閃電和震人的電響；</p>
<p>海燕喜歡它暴風雨裏的飛翔，</p>
<p>驚濤駭浪裏它越飛越顯得勇猛，</p>
<p>飛掠過浪頭，飛掠過雲腳，</p>
<p>在門爭中乃威著不可一世的快樂！</p>
<p>展縮的清水烏被白浪吞沒，</p>
<p>企鹅藏躲的岸岸也全沖倒；</p>
<p>得意的海燕喊出勝利的預言：</p>
<p>「暴風雨後，將有晴明在前面！」</p>

<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>逢到颳了一天黃風或是雪道深厚時老種便不想嚧着塞氣到大街上作買賣去了，他的攤子從街角移到了自家雜院的門前，那塊矮小的照牆成了自來的擋風牌，在藍布頂　下，老種的黑布皮背心上　着光，他紅腫了手拉着麵團，像是排陣列似的。把一段　　在按板上。小鬍子上凝了呵氣，閃在暗暗的天光裏，人又打一下噤，心上呌一聲寒冷。</p>
<p>「多點芝蔴呀！」</p>
<p>「留神，烤得別太焦也別太嫩，不脆不　正　式！」</p>
<p>「芝蔴醫要多抹，香香的！」</p>
<p>雖然是兩個大銅子一個的買賣，主僱們也還是煩瑣地　　着他。</p>
<p>老種眼也不抬一抬地，不去搭話，他把讓風吹得快熄了的火星吹起來，把燒餅摸子多在芝蔴　子裏滾滾，抬頭望一望　頂幔，便又垂下頭去，人們也暫時閉住了嘴。</p>
<p>「老種，昨晚怎的那麼不走運，呵呵呵！」</p>
<p>「昨天那副牌到我裏可不那　鬥，捻長三　留么二……那夠多！」</p>
<p>對過煤鋪的黑張飛們或是拉包月（車）的伙伴們打着哈欠来找老頭兒。</p>
<p>傴僂着的黑皮背心霍地直了起來，振落了，兩顆沾在鬍了頂上的水珠兒，老種使那滿是油汚的袖子抹抹鼻子　媽的知道是什麼纏了心，一個勁兒地走了背運，別想捻，張好牌，哎，也是人老珠黃不値錢！我，一個眼花，　錯了地上的牌，是怪我鬥錯了……」</p>
<p>老鐘這可從心眼兒裏湧出一陣笑，簡起想用圍裙抹抹手撑起腰板來「神聊」一下，可是禁不住邊上的催促。宏亮的嗓子在風雪裏撼搖得像一陣笨濁的駝鈴：</p>
<p>「得啦，等一會兒不好麼，聽我們的舊賬不好麼，昨晚的不好今晚的一定「賽」極了，我老鍾十把裏總有一把贏，別的也不敢吹！老張飛你　我今晚和祥老弟他們剝你的皮……」</p>
<p>老種的「哈哈哈」呌僱客們的責罵給蓋住了。</p>
<p>那西口的王寡婦櫻唇愛背一遍書：</p>
<p>「老鍾可眞是傻瓜，當了一輩子光棍兒，把錢全送在紙　和牌九上了，家裏不是放着一畝高梁地不種，老鐘，不是麼？沒有弟見沒有姪兒，我說是不是傻瓜呀，十個指頭賺來的十來吊錢天天送在黑炭兒們手裏！」她扭一扭檢着「潛兒」（一種髪　）的腦袋往西復查了，發揮了議論怪高興的神兒。這裏可鬥起了一陣嘻笑：</p>
<p>「怎麼不　啦，鐘大哥！說說玩玩怕嗎的？」</p>
<p>「老鐘害羞呢，」也不知是哪個麻臉嫂子輕輕地又帶上了一句:「鐘大在哥五十多年沒有近過一個女人！」</p>
<p>「買燒餅就買得啦，還聊上十八串，聊些個「賭」倒還不大離兒，却總是什麼女人，沒兒沒女……」他氣得臉發紅，黏了一手芝蔴醬的大手來回來去地揮着：「我老種年輕時沒命兒娶，怨誰？年壯時剛夠吃半個肚子，怨誰？到如今，能剩個幾吊的又夠什麼？腦袋也禿了，——又怨誰？」他趁着會兒空擦乾了手點上支旱烟：</p>
<p>「不讓我歇歇儿看看牌幹嗎？我說——幹嗎？苦了一輩子，累了一輩子，也該喘喘氣兒啦！別的事情上受氣吃，只有在幾張牌面兒上，我作主張了；我捻誰就捻誰；我丟誰就丟誰，就像我遭幾十年被人拉被人推似的，」他嚼着檳榔般反覆回味：「被人拉，推，打，罵……哦，五十多年了，…」</p>
<p>大夥兒知道老鐘是拿過槍當過學徒要過把戲的，直到賣燒餅前一個月，老鐘還在街上要得滿頭是汗地向觀客們求錢，但當意外地使他失望了時，他憤怒得破口大罵，氣哼哼地不露面了一些日子。</p>
<p>在大夥兒的嚴肅的沉默下，老鐘却又猛地狂笑了，心上的一些暗影被這陣沒涙的號啕趕走了，重又看到了他那藍頂幔以外的青天，老人的氈毛靴邊鬆地移動幾下</p>
<p>他會下意識地把一段段麵團排成紙牌或骨牌上的點子，自言自語地太息着：</p>
<p>「梅花對！天槓來了，妙！喲，可惜了兒的！要來個別的……」他沈思去了。</p>
<p>在糖葫蘆的木籃邊，他也會站住擠緊了眉毛抽着　子；孩子们在地上玩玻璃球时也會聽：</p>
<p>「鐘老大，來不來，一大枚一盤！戰一戰！」</p>
<p>這老伙計會先忸怩一下，看邊上大人不多便也呆笨地慢慢蹲下身來，他會忘機地拍手。清了嗓子喊呌，　髴是：也輪着我捻你推你了！</p>
<p>有几天老鐘是自動停工的，那便是左近有了婚喪事的時候，在鼓手執紼的人蹲在地上玩牌九或骰子的一夥中，老鐘聲坐在地上大佛爺似地獃在那兒。眼珠子瞪着那骰子，兩隻大手在腿上拍着</p>
<p>在輸光了錢而買賣又清閑了一會兒時，老鐘便會拿出一副紙牌，在按板上自對自地鬥起來，左手放一張，右三摸一張，芝蔴粒移來移去地作了勝負。</p>
<p>嘴裏還是咕嚕着：</p>
<p>「我捻你，就許我不要你，你，敢說一個不字！」</p>
<p>「這樣來，這親來就大家公公平平，誰也沒話兒說，公公平平！主八蛋的世界才不公平呀！」末了一句他是嚥了下去了。</p>
<h3 id="c183">獻書 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>—彈指隨拾之一—</p>
<p>故宮博物院所葺的清代文字獄檔，其中很多悲劇，也很多喜劇。要說那些犯法的，認眞要叛清復明，做民族英雄的似乎很少；大抵是「朱買臣」之流的人物，要貪圖一時的富貴，伏　獻書，不能如願；乃去獻奉他自己所註的詩易會通給乾隆皇帝，想由皇帝來替他做媒，過「奉旨完婚」的是頗有趣的。而其中情最可憫，結局最慘的莫如丁文彬大夏大明新書一案。</p>
<p>丁文彬。浙江上虞人，生長杭州，雍正年間，依傍兄嫂住在松江十餘年。他的哥哥和倒兒都很窮苦，係賣餅做工營生；却不料這位好弟弟帶累他們鬧出大事來。乾隆十六年五月間，丁文彬獨自到山東曲阜衍聖公府上去獻書，（大夏大明新書和昭武年號時憲書二種。）說是老衍聖公在世時，曾將二女許配與他；他引番除完婚以外，還要傳位專員嚴刑拷問；我們且看看他的口供：</p>
<p>問——你旣是小家出身，現在看你形如乞丐，當睥衍聖公怎肯與你結親？况結親從無兩女同許一人之理，又並無媒妁，顯屬妄賴了！</p>
<p>供——小子結親，是奉上帝命，何須媒妁呢？那一夫二婦，乃堯舜之道；舜妻堯之二女，班班可考。當年老衍無異，故傳位與小子，以二女妻之。這都蒙上帝啟迪所成。小子聞得衍聖公歿了，就接了位，如今已八年了。實因沒有人帮助，連飯都沒得吃。……那南方的人都不明大道。不理小子，沒奈何才要把做成這部　——那衍聖公，你怎麼筄他為聖帝又有書稿寄孔家婦女們呢？那董氏是何人之女？逐一供來！</p>
<p>供——上帝之命，總以有德卽有位。老衍聖公能守堯舜之道，應居天子之位。小子蒙聖公傳堯舜之道，猶如傳位，故書內尊崇他為聖帝，又稱他為藝祖；當日舜受位於堯，也稱藝祖的。那書內載明一岳母妻子的書，都是自己空寫，並沒有寄去，也記不清是那一年的事了。……那書內又說對董氏為妃；那董氏是松江人，他父親呌董恒山，開茶館的。小子沒飯吃，帮他扇過半年風箱。見他這女兒年方十五，生得好，小子心裏想，就把他對了，記載在書上的。</p>
<p>問——你書中對孔大舅為冡宰，又對孔叔舅為大宗伯，孔伯舅為大司徒，那都是什麼名字？又對你哥子為夏文公，你父母都對王封后，他們都在何處受封？你曾否有剳付等項給他們呢？</p>
<p>供——孔磊汩就是衍聖公，官司員原訪人都是孔家人做的，故此隨手記着要封的。哥子名丁文耀，與嫂子有秦氏在松江打燒餅賣，今年在人家麵館帮工。他是不明道理的人，常罵我痴子，故此我書內說兄頑嫂　侄傲了。祇因小子卽了位，禮應對他，故此寫在書上。</p>
<p>問——你還有偽造的時憲書六本，怎敢擅寫欽定字樣？你旣妄筄在位八年，為何又是每樣兩本，只有六七八供——小子只有一個人著書抄寫，因上帝命我趕修這洪範春秋，故此不能再有工夫造這新書了。直到卽位六年上，　造起的，只造得三年。那大夏是小子國號，天元是年號；小子因做得一無好處，去年請命了上帝，把天元改作昭武，傳位與小聖公約。旣有年號，就寫欽定了。至於書面上寫，「大夏」「大明」，那是取明明德的意思；「大夏」是取行夏之時的意思。</p>
<p>這事情是很明顯的，山東巡撫楊應琚的奏摺，也說：「丁文彬乃一至貧至賤之人，一旦稍習陳言，遂自詡為奇材異能，無出其右；因為妄想富貴女色，痴心日熾，結為幻影，牢不可破，輒肆其梟獍之心，狼號狗吠，無所不至」。蛤這事件的結局，並不把丁文彬當作神經錯亂的人看待。乾隆十八年六月，丁文彬奉旨凌遲處死。乾隆十八年九月，伊兒丁文耀侄丁士賢丁士麟依律條坐，應斬侯秋後處决。尚有年十五以下之子丁士良丁士位，解部入官為奴。王素行見逆書，並不首告，照律杖一百，流三千里。蔡穎達，徐旭初混看邪書，各杖八十。這意義又是很明白的：「聖明」的乾隆皇帝，他就把丁文彬這瘋子當作「殺雞　猴」的榜樣，呌大家不敢藏匿反動的書，隱庇反動的人；也就是說：看見了反動的文書，便非告發不可。</p>
<p>這幕喜劇就此完結，大夏大明天子和夏文公父子一同送上法塲。</p>

<h3 id="c184">怎樣來做一個健美的女性少女的一封信 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>我是一個最會講求衛生的女子，無時不幻想來做一個健康的女性。很不幸，而我的體格適得其反。非但我的發育細小，而且離開健美的條件，也差得太遠了。這是我幾睥來所抱的遺憾！但是我深信這種缺憾，終有一天被我彌補，我有這樣堅强的自信力，現在的成功，確實不是偶然的。</p>
<p>我的發育不全，根據多數醫生的判斷，完全是先天不足的關係。當我踏進××女中求學的辰光，校醫不許我入學，原因就是體格過分衰弱，據檢騐的結果，說我患有很劇烈的神經衰弱症，並且肺病的嫌欵，不宜讀書。</p>
<p>的確，我神經衰弱症是有的，所以平時覺得突然頭暈。目眩，耳嗚，心跳，甚至於月經不調。但是限於身體的關係，剝消了我求智的機會，何異驅我淪入地獄，我氣極了，我負氣回家，預備把自殺來結果我的生命！</p>
<p>「自殺」是弱者的行為啊，我是一個受過敎育的女子，豈可自蹈絕路，因此我又覺悟過來。從此孜研究攝生的方法，所有關於醫藥的雜誌書報，竭力搜羅閱讀，因此我明白：人體上的機講構，完全依靠血液來維持，要維持血液永不枯竭，　未必須內分泌腺的靈活而尤以生殖腺的健全為最要，然後可以充分發育，　根據了這種原理，所以對於生殖腺素製劑的「女用生殖素」不斷試服，同時作有規則的運動來活絡我的血脈。這樣大約有兩個月吧？我的身體非常强壯，體重由七十磅增到九十二磅，以前的衣服，統統嫌小，特別在乳房一部，這樣又過了兩個月，情形是完全改變了，非但體重又增加了十一磅，肌肉也結實了，乳峰的發育特別夾得豊腴，終日操作也不覺疲乏，以前的神經衰弱症，肺弱症，及月經病，目彰早已痊愈了。今年春季再跨進××女中求學，同學們見了我這樣的體格，無不嘖稱贊，一致筄我為「健美皇后」試想，假若不服「生殖素」豈不仍舊浸沉在苦海之中嗎？，因為我覺得這過程大有足供同病們借鏡的價値，所以請求你闢貴刋一角，代為登出，諒不致加以拒絕吧！　　馮潔謹上</p>
<p>淋病</p>

<h3 id="c185">之後尿道炎　與副睪丸炎 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>淋病之變化多端，故危險亦殊堪注意也。若擇醫選藥不愼，淋病侵入後部尿道，能惹起後部尿道炎疾病，可將排出之小便試騐，前後溷濁頗為顯明也。</p>
<p>淋菌因何而侵入後尿道？或因種種動作，或國初期洗滌不愼所致。其他陰莖勃起，膿液由前端倒流向後；患者不攝養，醫生醫衛不精，都能若起此症。</p>
<p>淋菌旣侵入後尿道部之後，第一徵象，為小便頻數，且呈顯著出血症狀，此時患者應服黃色素製劑的『安敵淋』以包圍淋菌，蓋『安敵淋』透膜殺菌之力宏大，其功效自有特殊之優點，凡有學識有經騐之醫師類能道之，絕非空言也。</p>
<h3 id="c186">腦溢血與骨痛之關係 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 劉志民醫師</p>
<p>腦溢血，亦名之為腦出血。因為每人的腦中，都有無數動脈在跳動着。其中有稱為「內　」的局部血管，是最容易破捐。但是何以會惹起的呢？因為從心臟經過頭部動脈而達到這一部分，差不多是一條血綫，直接感受由心臟發出之血流之力；在心臟亢奮，血壓甚高的時候，這部受激烈的衝突，當然會容易破捐。在內　附近，有因手足運動之神經通過，這部分若是出血：其運動神經，受血塊的壓迫，不能運用，結果會惹起半身不遂症了。</p>
<p>左側腦際，除有司手足的神經外，尚有言語中樞，當然運帶受害。所以罹腦溢血而昏倒的人，十之七八是會言語糊塗，神志昏迷。</p>
<p>綜上所述，則腦溢血的促成，係由血管破裂之故，血管之破裂則純因血管之硬化，如吾人已覺得肩臂不爽，手腕酸疼，筋骨麻木，腰背等處，時感疼痛者，則其大動脈的硬化，已達到極點。故凡稍具有普通的醫學常識，從自覺症狀發現之後，就要趕緊設法來防止危險的來臨。第一步必須將骨痛治愈，如能這樣當心去實行調治，則腦溢血的疾病，便不足恐怖了。</p>
<p>治愈骨痛的方法，欲其最有效最切合吾人的理想者，祇有採用强斯登我的「骨痛片」了，因為牠不單是能夠治療一切骨痛，同時預防動脈硬化的能力，也無出其右了，所以罹有骨痛症的人們，及動脈硬化的患者，千切勿要滯疑而使你的病陷於惡化。</p>
<h3 id="c187">遺精與生命的關係 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 俞伯符醫師</p>
<p>罹患遺精的，在青年中幾成為普遍的現象。因為青年們患遺精的太多了綠故，所以罹神經衰弱症而煩惱的青年也特別的多。</p>
<p>青年所以患遺精可分為三部觀察。一，因手淫而促成精關鬆弛。二，因淋病而惹成攝護腺炎，致　精管機能破壞。三，因生理的關係，致身精中樞過敏，時起夢遺，這三點分別起來講，後者比較前兩點危險較少。</p>
<p>不過可以斷定，一個患遺精劇烈的人，精神是一定衰頹的。腦力是一定薄弱的，一切的一切，生氣全無，前途是沒有希望，惟有等待死神的宰割而已。</p>
<p>當罹本症的初期，每在夜間，夢幻顚倒，將精液流出，醒已無及，在過度勞動之後，尤易流出。假若次數頻繁，那病象已轉入惡化了。劇烈時患者幾日無間斷，且在白日稍一操勞，或生殖器不愼與衣服被褥磨擦之後，也能流出。這完全因精管鬆懈，失了控制。試想精液是人體的生命腺，攝生的人，窮思極想，增精補血惟恐不力，那可以任牠流無止境呢！？這種嚴重的危險性，確屬是不容忽視了。</p>
<p>現在市上出售遺精藥種類不能算少，但是確有固精治漏的効力，很少很少。惟有希米脫氏『固精片』最能見效，確能根治遺精，若因遺精而發生早洩陰萎等症，則須並服「生殖素」其效尤為　人。</p>

<p>患者徐民强，四十七歲，上海浦東人，據云，染烟聞　早在光緒三十四年，竟達二十八年之久。故體弱已至極點，屢次戒煙，半途而廢，家中人均甚憂慮，（主訴）——骨節酸痛，稍减煙量，卽告氣喘，故　竣全功。（現在情形）—實因家產中落，每日不能支出鉅額之煙欵，　迭遭家中老小所指　，現抱决心戒除，由其親子伴來余處診治。（治療）—余診得徐君染毒太深，非用培補戒煙法難收全功，乃以『生殖素』戒除其癮，同時注射『育維賜保命』為期兩月，煙　戒絕，體健頓增云，</p>

<p>— 劉志民醫師</p>
<p>發育不全就狹義言之。係指臟器組織先天卽極小或畸形者是也。其廣義則係指人在發育時期。或以先天不足。或以手淫過度。全身軀體肌肉。均不能得充分健全之發育者是也。本症患者每伴有機能不足。故對於生活上有巨大之影響。</p>
<p>又有的謂局部發育不全者。例如陰莖雖至成人仍　小如孩童。統係生殖腺內分泌不足。無論全身及局部。均能獲得充分良好之健全發育。</p>
<p>患者鄭子成。年廿九歲。因先天秉賦不足。在發育時期又犯手淫。故身柔體弱。不惟軀幹矮小且肌肉示瘦削。　如童子。狀則如老人。發育旣不健全。遇事又輒厭倦。略一操作。卽感疲勞。雖曾服補劑數種。但未對症。故未見起色。去冬由張君介紹來余處診治。余察得鄭君之恙。非投以生殖腺內分泌製劑無從奏效。卽囑向中英藥房購服「生殖素」。頓覺肌肉飽滿。身體壯茁。氣血育盈。精神振作。不惟全身各部得良好之發育。卽望其態度。亦宛如二十一二·在社交方面，備受異性之歡迎云。</p>
<p>如何戒煙</p>
<p>是我租界上的居民，有煙癮已經七年了。七年中的煙毒積累，我的身體衰弱到了極點，本來我早要戒煙了，因身體之故，投鼠忌器，不敢輕舉妄動，現在聽得租界上的行政機關，已經接受我政府戒煙的條例，所以我抱了决心，蓄意戒除，請問用何藥斷　較速痛苦最少而最經濟合算。　（徐鼎臣問）</p>
<p>答尊體旣已衰弱，非服『生殖素』不為功，同時請注射『育維賜保命』，則斷癮愈速，痛苦减輕，而最合算也</p>

<h3 id="c190">取締私校濫收學生 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 劍平</p>
<p>本市的私立小學在數目上是很可驚人的，所以有所謂「弄堂小學」的不雅稱呼。而這一類的「弄堂小學」，無非是少數投機份子，意圖謀利，才開設此類小學，經費困難和人材的缺乏便造成了因陋就簡，學校變成了營業的商店，便是現社會的教育制度也被破壞無餘，要它能夠教導一般小孩子成為良好有用的人材，那更用不着去希望了。然而，光是因陋就簡，那仍不失為一所學校，可惜的是辦此類「弄堂小學」的學者們，因營業上的競爭，往往把學生變成貨物，或者變成私人的財產　用盡一切方法去收買，欺騙，籠絡，只要一個學生踏進了這學校的校門，便很像是「學商」們的目的物一樣，再不會放你走出這學校門口，非使你繳了學費和一切苛捐什稅般的費用以後，不會空讓你過去的。在「做生意」的手腕來說，這一類的「學商」，可說是非常出色的；如果談到什麼的教育，什麼的使學生對危急存亡，生死關頭的現在的國家社會有所認識，那是只有天曉得的。</p>
<p>最近，市教育局也注意到這一類「弄堂小學」的諾色醜態了。十二日本埠訊：市教育局鑒於私校種種不良的行為，影響本市整個教育甚大，因此嚴定取締辦法三項——一，各校不得以不正當方法招攬學生，如有利用鄰校教員勾引學生轉學情事發生，一經查實，定予取締不貸。二，教員在聘的未滿期內，未經原校長許可，不得轉任他校教職。三，如有不良教員，煽動學生，任意轉學，一經查有實據，已登記者徹消登記，未登記者各校一律不得聘用，如有聘用此等不良教員學校，應受嚴厲處分。</p>
<p>教育當局能夠注意這一類教育敗類的棍騙勾當，而盡力去嚴厲取締，這是我們所深慶幸的。現在，所頒行的三項取締辦法中，我們所未能滿意的便是只限於「招攬學生」這一現象，而沒有發見此類私校的還有許多的不良現象。不過，一件事的開始，往往不能十全十美的，我們當然不能過事苛求，反之我們只希望能在一事收效了以後，而能更澈底地去了解一般「學棍」，「學商」們的對教育的破壞，而取締之。</p>
<p>關於這三項辦法，似乎也未盡善。原因是把着眼點完全放在「不良教員」身上，而忽略了當事的主動者——拿錢出來辦學，志在賺回一筆的那些，掛着名義是校董，校長，或什麼的那一種類傢伙。如果沒有了他們諸般勾引，相信一般教員也未必「不良」。因此，我們主張對主事者的「學商」「學棍」嚴予取締，那才是一件比較有效的方法。主犯不罪，反罪從犯，這是永遠纏夾不淸的。</p>
<p>最後，我們還主張用積極方法去取締這一類「弄堂小學」。方法是把學校教育本身健全起來，不要使之有少許缺點，那才不會給「學商」，「學棍」們的「乘虛而入」。</p>
<h3 id="c191">求業 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 石季達</p>
<p>幾處可以找尋職業的地方都寫信去了，許久都沒有得到覆信。在附近的幾處地方，却總張羅着一點微薄的路費，乘車或乘船，甚至是步行，訪求親友，請求有入會在什麼地方為他安置了一個可以維持生活的飯碗。</p>
<p>「我的希望很小很小呢，」柳金想道，「只要微薄的薪金，免致餓死便夠了。」</p>
<p>然而這社會，農村破產，都市却患着貧血病，這使柳金的微小的希望也破滅了。失業的人是那麼多，因此飯碗的爭鬥也越發利害，這使像柳金那麼的社會地位的人，碰到了極大的困難。</p>
<p>「老兄，」他說着諸如此類的話，「我失業已經一年了。如果再沒有職業，不但自己不得了，便是一家人都要餓死了！」</p>
<p>而對方雖抱着極大的同情，而回答的話總是很籠統，令人摸不着頭腦。</p>
<p>「老弟，再多些時看看吧。」</p>
<p>「或者可以有，或者沒有，總之我不敢說定，這只看您的運氣怎樣吧了」。</p>
<p>甚至也有這麽說法的：</p>
<p>「請您不必焦燥吧。這是心急不來的。這要看機會，看機會。」</p>
<p>「不要說你已經失業了一年，有的人失業兩三年了，到現在也還找不到事做呢。」</p>
<p>更有的是明白地拒絕了。</p>
<p>「請您原諒！我自己的職位現在都有點搖動呢。」</p>
<p>「我想大概沒有辦法了。如果有，我怎麽會不同您設法呢？這里還在裁員，還在裁員呀！」</p>
<p>每次得到這樣的回答，總使他滿腔的希望都打成粉碎了；而灰喪地拖着身子回來，知道這次的路費又是白掉了。而這些微薄的路費，對於一個失業的人，又是多麽大的損失呢！</p>
<p>「我，一個角子是看得比一個銀元還要大呀！還要大呀！」他回來時總憤怒地喊道。</p>
<p>然而有什麼法子呢？不去碰一碰，機會總不會突然地拋到他身上來的，不過每决過了一次打擊，便使他的心向下一沈。而現在，經過了太多次的打擊，簡直是使他的眼前幾乎完全黑暗了。</p>
<p>從遠方寄來的覆信，也一封一封地收到了。然而那是什麼話呢？又是那一套敷衍或甚至是道歉的信件呀！更令人心灰的是有的人竟連信也不覆，使人望眼欲穿，又使人非常懊惱！</p>
<p>於是家里的東西是差不多當光了，借債也到了差不多不能再借的地步。一家人節省儉用，總難以滿足那天天需求米粒的肚子，而求業的心越焦急；看起來職業是越來越更渺茫了。</p>
<p>竭力從新聞紙上找求那些「徵求」或「聘請」的廣告，而每一次看後却總使他心灰。什麽「二百元的保證金」呀，什麽「名人介紹或保證」呀，……於是每一次總使他把報紙憤憤地拋開，或撕碎了。</p>
<p>「我如果有二百元，我如果曾認識了名人，我那里會怕失業呢！」他喊道。心上更浮上了暗影。</p>
<p>也曾到職業介紹所里去登記，填完了長長的表格，或和所里的職員們懇摯地談了一會。可是懇摯的談話對於一個失業的人有什麼用處呢？</p>
<p>「待有機會的時候，我們一定通知您，」職員們對他說道。</p>
<p>然而通知却許久許久不曾有過。後來有了通知了，可是接洽之後，不是自己不合格，便是條件太苛。有二個職業是合格了，而且條件也已講妥，只待最後的决定，（「多麽好呀！」現在有二個機會了，這次總不會失望吧？他想道。）可是到了訂立聘約的那一天，早上一個機關的職員却告訴他道：</p>
<p>「對不起！我們的機關突然遭受一個意外的打擊，現在不要用人了！現在做事是多麼難呀！」</p>
<p>而下午，另一個介紹所的職員却通</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>知他道：</p>
<p>「柳金先生：那個地位在已經給別人取去了。現在失業人眞多！眞多！差一點的眞是受屈了！」</p>
<p>於是整個的世界在柳金的眼前坍塌下來，他的眼睛氏花了！</p>
<p>「讓我死吧！讓我死吧！這世界！這世界！」他激努地喊道想起一家人的挨餓，禁不住眼涙是流下來了。</p>
<h3 id="c192">暑期妓館 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 時玳</p>
<p>烟台，是渤海海濱的一個繁化的都市、在夏季這地方被人們稱為「避暑勝地」，事實也正如此，一到天熱，闊氣的人就加倍增多，市面的繁榮自然也有了新的轉機。以前我兩次留居在這裏，不過都是風雪狂暴的冬天，而且時間並不長久，那時烟台给我的印象是时间並不長久，那時烟給我的印象是怒海的巨浪，遠來求乞的難民，一羣羣受了飢餓的鞭笞的奴隸，以及寒冷所造成的慘苦的景象，一切都令人痛心。此次我是第三次來到這地方，因為是夏天，這都市的面目就呈現了與彰不同的形態。天空掛着灼熱的太陽，紅頂的洋房和士敏土馬路被陽火炙得發燙。鄉下來的運貨車不斷的走來走去，拉車的騾子，汗水直淌。齷齪的發着汗臭的碼頭苦力，在烈日炎炎之下，手忙脚亂的搬運貨物。海水是那麼平靜，小汽艇，偈飛翔的鳥兒似的，自由的在海面上奔馳，渾身是白的美利堅水兵，唱着歌，彷彿故意嘲笑那些舢板夫。</p>
<p>有好些人是把自己的希望放在夏天這個節季裏，他們盼望着，美利堅的軍艦一到一切應時的生意就都開始了。跳舞塲，西餐館，咖啡座，鮮花店，水菓公司，祗要美利堅水兵以及其他避暑的人們所需要的，都應有盡有。由於生活習慣的結果，烟台人並不感到停留在海港裏的三四十隻兵艦的威脅，總說他們是來「歇伏」（註：「避暑」的意思）究竟是侵犯了我們的自由，我們的海港為什麼他們隨便來駐軍艦？這些，烟台人都似乎弄不清楚，他们祇知道，「夏天来了就呆以赚外國人的錢。」</p>
<p>夏天，烟臺地方簡直跟殖民地差不多，被踐踏的奴隸們底血跡到處都是，祗要你不是聾子還可以聽到飢餓者的吼聲。「暑假妓館」裏的妓女就是被生活所逼迫而出賣肉體的奴隸。每晚我都打烟台山下這道街經過到後海岸去，從這條街上可以看到無數「暑假妓館」她們完全做外國人的生意，換句括說，她們是為美利堅水兵而來的。走在這條街上少微留心一下就會看到那些艶裝媚態的廣東妓女，和那些醉醺的外國水兵。幾次想到那妓館裏去看看，終沒有鼓起勇氣。所以祗有晚上路過看看外表而已，然而她們的生活內容我實在想知道知道。於是我去請敎曾經去過「暑假妓館」的朋友，那位朋友在一家英國洋行做事，因為有錢，烟花柳巷就不免常去。據他自己說，「暑假妓館」他時常去，裏邊的情形也非常熟習，可是他不肯告訴我：</p>
<p>——你年輕輕的不要問那些勾當！</p>
<p>他倒是好意，告訴了我怕我學壞。實他是錯了，我一個流浪者那來的閒錢復查花在妓女身上？喜幸得這一個好機會，那是一天晚上：我獨自在後海岸散步，討厭的外國水兵喝得瀾醉，吵嘴打架，踢翻洋車夫的洋車，我不忍去目覩那種慘景，悄悄的踱到岩石上去坐着歇凉，遥望着海裏的軍艦上的星星般的燈光，水面上動着巨影。西邊碼頭上傳來的苦力們的抗唷聲是那麼動聽。</p>
<p>——嘿嘍！——突然一個人拍我的肩膀——你什麼時候來的？</p>
<p>是孫衛民者君，就是我說的在英國人洋行裏做事的那位朋友，他身後還有一個女的，在黑暗中我看不出的她的面孔。當她坐在我旁邊的宕石上時，使我從黑影裏看出了她的打扮，顯然她是個妓女，衣裝的式樣也分明是「暑假妓館」裏出來的。</p>
<p>我們三個人坐在宕石上開始了談天，衛民是喜歡打趣的人，說起說來總是帶着滑稽成分，我們講星談月，又講到海，那位女的發言了：</p>
<p>——海，現在看怪可愛的，可是我怕海，前年媽媽從門夏帶我到香港去，她投海死了。去年我從香港來烟台，又遇到風浪，把我暈得死去活來唉，我眞怕海，為什麼有人發明火車飛機，却沒人發明塡海的機器！</p>
<p>——沒有海我們會給水淹死呢？</p>
<p>話趕話，她就露出了她的身世，我却乘着機會，問起他們「暑期妓館」裏的情形。</p>
<p>——先生！人家都說我閃這行人沒良心，這是太冤枉人了。我們的身子自已是做不過主來，鴇母呌我怎樣就得怎樣，她是為錢，我們呢？就是替她掙錢的傢器。像我們來烟台做這三個月的買賣，眞是難極了，不會說英文不行，不會唱洋歌還不行。烟台這裏的館子（註：卽暑期妓館）都是廣東人開的，姊妹們也都是廣東人，平常都是在香港，廣州，上海混事；夏天來了，就趕到此地來，唉！那些外國水兵太兇，動不動就打姊妹們誰也不願接外國人！……」</p>
<p>無邊的夜在海面上飄浮着軍艦上打着旗语SLE……潮水擊着宕石汽笛的吼擊壓抑了舢板的櫓聲。我閃離開了海岸，衛民和那個妓女回去。睡覺了，我回到家學徒們正在講着外國水兵打死妓女的事。</p>

<p>錢景章錢醉仙毛家書</p>
<p>中西（一〇四〇）上午十時至十時三刻</p>
<p>開篇「桃花源記」</p>
<p>何處仙源可避茶。探幽昔有武陵人。他是，捕魚為業身閒散。一櫂烟波來往頻。去去渾忘途遠近。綠溪祗顧向前行。忽然見，桃花夾岸紅於錦。芒草盈堤綠似茵。林盡好山迎面起。　然洞口露光明。漁翁是，舍舟登陸將身入。行盡桃花見一村。阡陌交通桑竹茂。雞嗚犬吠過相聞。田間男女衣冠古。驀地相逢笑語親。黃髪垂髫皆色喜。殺雞作食宴嘉賓。他們是，自言先世避贏秦亂。絕境同寄此身。今日不知何世界。恍如隔斷軟紅塵。漁翁備述今時事。相對同嗟世變更。各備酒肴邀下榻。互相留欵意殷勤。徘徊數日漁人返。俱說道，此遇休為外界云。漁父回船將原路誌。告知太守到溪濱。遺人隨往重探訪。洞口述茫無處尋。高士南陽劉子驥。欣然親往也枉勞神。從此無人再問津。</p>
<p>何芸芳何琴雙珠球</p>
<p>麟記（一二二〇）十一時一刻至十二時</p>
<p>開篇「潯陽琵琶」</p>
<p>香山司馬下江洲。夜泊潯陽渡古頭。送客黯然同惜別。荻花楓葉晚江秋。想我是，自悲宦謫飄萍梗。祖餞登帆水上浮。遙望江心盆浦月。已到了，　更二鼓起譙樓。忽聽得，衰聲四起調絃索。為　那，何處凄凉似訴愁。故而，賓主尋聲鄰舫近。喚敎他，移船相見半含羞。一見那，秋娘老去猶丰韻。座上樽添酒一甌。只聽那，自叙生平縈舊夢。奈何是，春花秋月不重留。鹍絃曲按調銀甲。那知道，鴛帳空戀墜玉鈎。往事不堪回首望。說不盡，幾番衷曲話從頭。見他是。殘脂　粉空餘恨。血染羅裙舊石榴。到後來，車馬漸稀悲冷落。怎嫁得，浮梁夫婿去難留。宛比是，秋風捐棄宮紈扇。月缺難邀玉斧修。可知道，自古歡塲同宦海。滄桑變易去悠悠。我亦是，天涯一樣飄零客。為勸你，再彈一曲更何求。都只為，卿卿無物重相贈，翻作新腔作歌曲酬。待到那，曲罷酒闌人去後。一聲歸路聽嗚騶。只覺得，紅粉青　　涙流。</p>

<p>元昌（一一二〇）午夜零時三刻至一時半</p>
<p>開篇「齊國馮驩」（咪咪集創列號）齊國馮驩赤骨貧。曾經投謁孟嘗君。自家懷刺登門拜。乍敘寒溫問姓名。狼狽衣冠羞面目。客旡好也客旡能。知君慷慨知君義。願廁三千食客人。已分上下中三舍。究竟東君愛客心。閒來倚柱三彈劍。食則旡魚出則行。況旡衣食及家庭。大度田文旡不允、。揚揚意氣訴親鄰。一旦雪中收債務。自然勞力費先生。矯詔傳呼焚契券。並將牛酒犒貧民。一雙空手歸報命。與君市義布聲名。不料齊王收相印。薛中父老謝深恩。馮驩遊說秦邦去。抵掌而談句句聽。高車駟馬聘田文。齊國敬向秦國聘。仍為齊相立朝庭。半生富貴馮驩力。食客三千難評論。足智多謀冠古今。</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) Today, the atmosphere of civil war is becoming increasingly evident. Yu Hanmou's troops are steadily advancing from Jiangxi towards Guangzhou. It is reported that they have reached Dazhao (transliteration), which is ten miles from Shaoguan. Shaoguan is 120 miles north of Guangzhou and is the ultimate destination of Yu's army. Chen Jitang is using Yingde, which is forty miles south of Shaoguan, as the first line of defense. The Second Army of Guangdong, led by Zhang Da, and other divisions have concentrated in that area, with Yuantan, which is 35 miles south of Yingde, as the second line of defense, and Juntian, which is only a few miles north of Guangzhou, as the third line of defense. Chen Jitang is currently dispatching trains to rush military supplies to the "front lines." The Guangyuan section of the Yuehan Railway has been requisitioned for military use, and passenger and freight trains have been suspended. Military vehicles and troops are very congested on that section of the railway line. Several airplanes arrived from overseas yesterday and are now being assembled and prepared for use as quickly as possible. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e2">Zhang Wei and Others Telegraph Their Opposition to the Unrest <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Zhang Wei, the head of the First Training Regiment of the Second Guangdong Army (and younger brother of the Second Army Commander Zhang Da), along with Qin Xiang, the head of the Tenth Regiment of the Fourth Division of the same army (Chen Jitang's former company scribe), and Huang Chaochong, the head of the Fourteenth Regiment of the Fifth Division, opposed the unrest in Guangdong and Guangxi, left the army, and came to Hong Kong. They published two telegrams on the 14th and 15th, one addressed to Chen Jitang and the other to the army and division commanders. The two telegrams are as follows: (1) To Commander-in-Chief Chen Boren, Regarding this Southwestern banner of resistance against Japan, your subordinates did not at first understand the true situation. How could we have known that you would wield your spears to the north, intending to shake the central government, building fortresses in Shaocheng, aiming inward rather than outward, causing panic in Guangdong, and confusion among the soldiers and the masses? After reading the telegrams from Yu, Li, Li, Huang, and Zhang, it became clear that you were using the name of resistance against Japan. Your subordinates were deeply fearful and could not express it in words. As soldiers, our duty is to obey, and our righteousness lies in loving our country. We can only follow you to devote ourselves to the revolution and are unwilling to blindly follow you, colluding with Li Bai to harm the country, misleading the nation, and selling out the race. Now, driven by conscience and blood, we left the unit on the 13th of this month. All matters within the unit have been handed over to the regimental adjutant to act as an agent. We travel far alone to make our intentions clear. (2) (Titles Omitted) We believe that the duty of a soldier is to obey first and foremost, and those who receive salaries as officials should seek to serve the country. Those who harm the people and rebel against the party are the accomplices of warlords, and those who flatter foreigners and endanger the country are marked by severe penalties. Historical teachings and public opinion are clear enough to warn us. This time, our Southwest raises the banner of resistance against Japan, but who knew that the secrets were heavy, and the two or three magnates had not awakened from their dreams? They used the authority of the heavens and humanity and boasted of the spirit of the king. They falsely invoked beautiful names, secretly communicated with enemy countries, arbitrarily changed ranks, confused the people, drove compatriots to kill each other, and deployed border defenses in the hinterland, intending to harm the central government, sparing no effort to engage in internal strife. Since the beginning of this incident, they have exhausted their skills to inflict hardship on the people of Guangdong, and there is no end to it. All loyal admonishments are regarded as enemies. There is a great tendency that the people will not be exhausted, the country will not be destroyed, and they will not stop. How can this not be painful? Alas, Sima Zhao's intentions are known to all. Therefore, some have telegraphed military advice in the past, and others have kept themselves clean and far away in the aftermath, truly driven by conscience and surging with blood, wanting to seek salvation in one out of ten thousand. Our fellow countrymen in Guangdong and Guangxi, embracing doctrine and loving the country without falling behind others, should seek good strategies for salvation and how to place themselves, and must not blindly follow and lightly test the edge of public opinion, leading to destruction together. This is truly fortunate. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Li Zhenqiu, the newly appointed Deputy Commander of the First Army of the Fourth Route Army, along with division commanders Mo Xide, Ye Zhao, Zhang Ruigui, and others, as well as all officers and soldiers, telegraphed Chen Jitang on the 14th, accusing him of colluding with Japan and selling out the country, confusing his subordinates, and deceiving the people. The original telegram stated: Guangzhou City, Mr. Chen Boren, Upon receiving your telegram, we were filled with emotion. What are your intentions in arbitrarily raising troops this time? Even women and children can see it. How can you still use the beautiful name of resistance against Japan to confuse your subordinates and deceive the people? May we ask, what was the so-called solution to diplomatic relations with Japan that Mr. Weizhou reported at the meeting in Meihuacun? Resisting Japan while actually colluding with Japan is the same farce as prohibiting opium while selling opium. The telegram also questioned us with the words "difficult to face the martyrs in the cemetery of the First Division." Zhenqiu and others are unwilling to blindly follow you in colluding with Japan and selling out the country, which is precisely why we are protecting the glory of the martyrs. If the martyrs were aware, they would certainly tacitly approve. We only fear that your actions will not be forgiven by the martyrs. Conscience cannot be extinguished, and facts cannot be concealed. We hope that you will think quietly and kneel and repent at the cemetery of the First Division, and do not babble any more. As the saying goes, "The faults of a gentleman are like the eclipses of the sun and moon." We hope that you will not be blinded by petty men and remain ignorant from beginning to end. The world is in turmoil, and it is all for you alone. We hope that you will handle it well. Zhenqiu and others only seek the survival of the country and the nation, and nothing else matters. We sincerely reply, hoping to be forgiven. Li Zhenqiu, Mo Xide, Ye Zhao, Zhang Ruigui, Peng Linsheng, Deng Ruichang, Zhong Fangjun, and other officers and soldiers together bow and ask for forgiveness. (14th) Printed.

<h3 id="e7">Kong's Financial Report at the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister Kong recently made an important report on finance at the Fifth Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, divided into two parts: finance and banking. The finance section was further divided into central finance and local finance. Regarding central finance, Kong described the state of revenue and expenditure in the 24th year in great detail. The following is an excerpt of the main points: Regarding the expenditure part, all types of regular and temporary payments were made in accordance with the published budget for the 24th year. However, the amount of various supplementary funds was quite large, so the expenditures for party affairs, political affairs, military affairs, national defense construction, education and culture, subsidies to local governments, capital for state-owned enterprises, and anti-communist expenses were all greatly increased compared to previous years. Although debt expenses were reduced to over 10 million yuan, unexpected expenses such as river embankment projects and disaster relief reached over 20 million yuan, so expenditures exceeded the budgeted amount by a considerable amount. As for the revenue part, customs revenue has always been the most important source, followed by salt tax and consolidated tax, and then tobacco and alcohol stamp tax. Other items were not major sources of revenue, and transaction tax and income tax were not collected in the 24th year. Among them, before the implementation of the legal currency, the customs revenue was affected by the rising price of silver overseas, financial tightening, industrial and commercial depression, and the widespread flooding, resulting in reduced purchasing power and declining tax revenue each month. After the implementation of the legal currency, export goods became very active. Last December and this January, international trade turned into a surplus, which was rare in decades. However, although exports increased, most of the export tax rates were low to encourage industry and commerce, which was beneficial to the national economy but not to customs revenue. This year, the customs revenue was further harmed by large-scale smuggling, resulting in a shortfall of over 90 million yuan in the national customs revenue for the 24th year compared to the budget. Salt tax and consolidated tax were short-collected in areas affected by floods, banditry, and in North China. However, due to strict supervision and reduced expenses, the revenue was not too different. Tobacco, alcohol, and stamp tax were short 6 million yuan because a portion was used to subsidize local tax revenue. The total revenue for the year was almost 100 million yuan short of the budgeted amount. With such a shortage of revenue and such an increase in expenditures, it was always difficult to find ways to make up the difference. However, in the face of this severe national crisis, national defense construction is necessary for the survival of the nation, economic construction relies on nurturing the nation's vitality, educational construction is necessary to promote the general improvement of society, and other capital for state-owned enterprises is for the development of transportation or for increasing production. The increase in these types of expenditures is all important and must be raised with all efforts to support them. Therefore, throughout the year, efforts were made to reorganize tax affairs. Strict punishment methods were set for customs smuggling, and tax collection agencies such as the central tax, tobacco and alcohol, and mining taxes were gradually merged and reorganized to eliminate long-standing malpractices. The stamp tax was changed to be sold by the post office, and the results were quite good. Financial administrative expenses were also gradually reduced. The percentage of administrative expenses in relation to tax revenue was 11% in the 20th year, 9.9% in the 21st and 22nd years, and was reduced to 9.2% in the 23rd and 24th years. On one hand, new taxes were being prepared. Income tax will soon be levied, and inheritance tax is also being actively prepared. The overall goal is to implement new taxes without disturbing the people or hindering the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce, in order to increase revenue and achieve a balance between revenue and expenditure. Regarding the debt portion, in addition to the issuance of the Unified and Revival Bonds, there was also the Telegraph Bond of 10 million yuan issued jointly with the Ministry of Transportation, and the Third Phase Railway Construction Bond of 12 million yuan issued jointly with the Ministry of Railways. The first 40 million yuan of this railway construction bond was used for railway and telegraph construction. The interest fund for the first four years of this railway construction bond was subsidized by the national treasury. In addition, foreign debts that have been in arrears over the years, such as the Crisp Loan, the Jinpu Railway Loan, and the Daowei Railway Loan, are now being separately reviewed and paid, or arrangements are being made to maintain credit. Regarding local finance, Kong stated that the most important point is to abolish exorbitant taxes and reduce surcharges on land tax. As of the end of June this year, it was reported that various provinces had abolished over 5,000 types of exorbitant taxes and reduced the amount by over 51 million yuan, and the Ministry of Finance gave subsidies based on the local situation. The key is to establish a budget system. Under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance, 21 provinces and municipalities and 1,059 counties compiled budgets in the 24th year. This kind of progress is gratifying. The financial situation of various provinces is gradually getting on the right track. For example, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan, Henan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces have not only established budgets but also have matching revenues and expenditures, and even have surpluses. The central government often tries its best to assist provinces with revenue and expenditure deficits within the possible scope. The most prominent example is Sichuan's finances, which were extremely chaotic in the past. Since Chairman Jiang entered Sichuan to suppress bandits, it was decided that the central government would assist in the reorganization. To date, Sichuan Post-War Bonds and financial treasury bills have been issued to reorganize finance, repay debts, and handle post-war construction. The local budget for Sichuan in the 25th year was also approved by the central government to achieve a balance between revenue and expenditure. The central government and local governments are originally one. If the local government has a surplus, it should be remitted to the central government. If the local government has a deficit, the central government should provide subsidies. This is the government's established policy and must be implemented with all efforts.

<h3 id="e11">Industry Amidst Internal and External Troubles <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>China's industry is in a special environment. It also lacks a sound organization. Development is not easy. Today, there are those who do not want to coexist with us. Under the guise of promotion, they enter our homes and carry out their plans of complete control. For example, the Tianjin Huaxin Yarn Factory was forced to sell because Japanese yarn companies controlled the North China textile market and dared not continue investing. Another example is the Liujiang Coal Mine, which was skillfully seized because it could not receive political protection. These are clear examples. If this continues, even the existing fragile foundation will be completely shaken.</p>
<p>However, the blows suffered by industry are not only due to external troubles. There are also internal troubles. For example, the soaring prices in the flour, wheat, yarn, and cotton futures markets cannot be said to have raised prices and benefited industry and commerce. Instead, they are said to be speculation and manipulation, creating opportunities for others. The price of yarn has risen by 135 yuan in the past half month, and cotton has also risen by 45 yuan. However, actual sales are sluggish, and the stockpiles in warehouses have not moved at all. Moreover, it is said that there are more than 80,000 bales of yarn in the city, and only 6,000 bales of Japanese yarn. With their rich production, their small stockpiles are far beyond the reach of Chinese yarn factories. Then, for whom is the manipulation of yarn prices to make them expensive, if not to create opportunities for Japanese yarn? Another example is speculation in flour futures, which is almost unmanageable. Even with the market closing and price restrictions, many people are still unwilling to resell. The short sellers also have no way to buy back. This only creates a situation of being neither dead nor alive. It has also led Japanese merchants to purchase wheat in the interior. Although their purchase may be a kind of retaliation for trade with Australia, it is also due to the skyrocketing price of flour. The raw material problem for the flour milling industry is already insufficient. The addition of more competition creates more difficulties. This is also promoted by speculators. A market that is supposed to stabilize prices and circulate goods for the industry has become a tool for outsiders to manipulate and profit from. Is this not a problem in the heart of the industry? Before the currency reform, the industrial community believed that once the reform was implemented, funds would be available and recovery would be hopeful. We have always secretly been worried about this. First, can the ample financial capital be transferred to industrial capital without fueling speculation? Second, what actual benefits will China's industry and commerce receive from rising prices? Today, many factories still lack funds and have no way to develop. Although prices have risen, the benefits are mostly received by foreign merchants' products. The outlet for financial capital is still speculation. It is said that most of the yarn stored in warehouses is for arbitrage. This can be seen.</p>
<p>The factory industry has reached a time of critical survival. There is no other way but to save itself. The way to save itself is to gather the strength of the industry to resist foreign invasion. Judging from past situations, industrial and commercial associations often have different goals and engage in exclusion and infighting. This is their usual skill. When facing difficulties, they then think of turning to the law, hoping to achieve the effect of unified action. This is also difficult. Secondly, new industries often have small profits to be made, and people rush to imitate them, producing crude and shoddy goods, without planning for supply and demand, and without regard for reputation. In the end, they suffer a complete defeat and perish together, and foreign goods can once again return. Such situations are also not uncommon. Third, the capital is weak, and they do not know their own capabilities, expanding their organization. In the end, they have insufficient turnover and no way to borrow money, leading to failure. Fourth, they do not seek the refinement of their products but only know how to run around and engage in speculation, falsely stealing names and relying on other forces to promote their products. This is using political means in industry, only seeking temporary gains, and not caring about the right way of doing business. How can they promote industrial progress? Fifth, the industry market cannot be maintained. When external forces invade, they are turned into control. They lose their effect of stabilizing prices and circulating goods. Such situations are also not uncommon. However, if the factory industry can truly organize itself, thoroughly correct its past mistakes, and take the interests of the industry as its own, set a proper plan, and proceed step by step, the financial industry can also take assisting industry as its only policy for lending money. If we can all help each other in the same boat to overcome difficulties, the future of China's industry may have a glimmer of hope.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Adjusting Sino-Japanese Relations: Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's Attitude - First Interview with the Foreign Minister by the Central News Agency Correspondent in Tokyo - Arita States that Basic Adjustment Requires Long-Term Patience <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, a Central News Agency correspondent visited Japanese Foreign Minister Arita at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a half-hour conversation. This marks the first time a Chinese news reporter has interviewed a Japanese Foreign Minister, and it is the first news report by the Central News Agency's Tokyo correspondent. After presenting his card, the reporter was immediately received. He first expressed his gratitude and explained his mission in Japan, then inquired about his attitude towards adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. Arita replied that he fully agreed with Foreign Minister Zhang's diplomatic report at the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. There is no doubt that Sino-Japanese relations should undergo a basic adjustment, but the matter involves numerous complexities and cannot be achieved overnight. It requires long-term patience. He is very concerned about this matter, having devoted his efforts to it since being appointed Ambassador to China and later promoted to Foreign Minister. The reporter further asked that currently, some quarters in both countries believe that it would be more effective to negotiate specific issues directly rather than discussing principles first, as this would more easily achieve adjustment. He inquired about the Foreign Minister's opinion. Arita replied that since fundamental and significant issues require a longer period of time and patience to resolve, attempting to resolve outstanding issues at this time is extremely necessary. This is my consistent policy towards China, as I have stated before. The reporter then asked whether the Foreign Minister agreed with the Chinese public opinion that the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations should be based on mutual respect for each other's national sovereignty and equality. Arita replied that indeed, he also firmly believes that only in this way can true friendship between the two countries be firmly established. The reporter further asked whether a unified and strong government in China would be beneficial to future Sino-Japanese relations. Arita replied yes. The reporter also inquired about his opinion on the Liangguang Incident. Arita stated that it was an internal Chinese matter, and he could not express any opinion. However, if there were anti-Japanese activities, the Japanese government could not ignore them. The reporter then discussed the administrative progress of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. Arita replied that this was also an internal Chinese affair, but the establishment of the East Hebei organization was due to the needs of the time. If there is no longer a need for it now, it can be abolished. The reporter asked about Japan's hopes for Wang Kemin. Arita frankly replied that Japan has two hopes: first, that North China should not be used as a base for anti-Japanese activities; and second, that North China should have close economic ties with Japan and Manchuria. Arita did not criticize Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, saying that he had only read a rough outline in the newspapers and had not yet had time to study its contents. When Arita met with the reporter, his attitude was gentle and sincere, with the demeanor of a statesman. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) A Japanese reporter inspection group visited Song Zheyuan this morning. Song expressed two points: first, the primary task in North China is to stabilize the people's hearts, and he hopes that China and Japan will trust each other; second, under mutual trust, consultations can be conducted on mutually beneficial social and economic cooperation.

<p>(Beiping) The Japanese reporter delegation to China paid a visit to Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, at 10:00 a.m. on the 16th, asking about Sino-Japanese opinions. Song often expressed that (1) the most important thing in North China at present is to stabilize the people's hearts, and he hopes that the governments and people of China and Japan will trust each other with sincere attitudes; (2) under mutual trust, mutually beneficial matters can be carried out, such as economic cooperation. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, met with a group of Japanese reporters at 11:00 a.m. today and made an important statement, saying that in order to realize Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, it is absolutely necessary to stabilize the people's hearts. I believe that at any time, we must give each other a deep impression of genuine friendship, and frequent exchanges should be made to seek emotional harmony. Only then will economic cooperation be possible. I hope that Japan will strongly assist in the economic revitalization of North China. The most promising area for developing North China's economy is the mining industry, among which the iron mines in the Ping-Sui-Xuanhua area are most likely to be realized. This matter is currently being studied by both China and Japan. Transportation construction is the foundation of economic development, so railway construction cannot be delayed. Therefore, it is imperative to realize the construction of the Cangshi Railway, the economic trunk line of North China. Preparations are currently underway. However, the issue of economic cooperation requires that the responsible person be the right person, so personnel selection must be prudent. Wang Kemin's return to North China will definitely open up a path in this regard. The strengthening and expansion of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council will also have to wait until Wang's return to North China before a decision can be made. I am determined to wait for the establishment of the executive organs to realize Sino-Japanese cooperation in military, economic, and cultural aspects. (Allied News dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The water level of the Yongding River in the Wuqing section has risen again, with many breaches along the river embankments. The Yubakou and Shuangkou sections north of Tianjin are overflowing the top of the embankments. More than a thousand people from over thirty villages in Pangzhuang are desperately trying to block the breaches. However, due to the rapid and large flow of water, they were unable to protect it in time, and the embankment collapsed for more than ten zhang (approximately 33 meters). More than twenty villages, including Chenzuizi and Qujiadian, were submerged, covering more than one hundred square li (approximately 50 square kilometers). The North Grand Canal Bureau is coordinating with the Yongding River Bureau to intensify rescue efforts. The upstream water level of the Hutuo River has risen sharply. It overflowed in Xuzhao Village, Anping, on the 13th. Villagers are sounding gongs day and night to protect the area. More than a thousand mu (approximately 67 hectares) of crops along the embankments have been flooded. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>

The project cost 300,000 yuan, which was used to dredge the river in sections, and was completed in two months. Water conservancy in the suburbs of Tianjin will be convenient from now on. Today, when the water was released, Li Tingyu wrote a couplet himself and hung it on the platform: "If the dredge takes even half a penny of graft, though spared by heaven's punishment today, he will surely fall into the river and die."

<p>Montreux - The Montreux Conference on the Dardanelles Strait has passed the Soviet amendment to the British draft regarding the need for the Straits in wartime. There were no objections. The final obstacle to the negotiations has now been removed as a result. It is said that the amendment that has now been passed is that warships of belligerent countries may not pass through the Straits, except for those fulfilling obligations under the League of Nations Covenant and those involving Turkey as a party to the agreement in certain situations. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Montreux - Since the Montreux Conference passed the Soviet amendment, the main point of contention has been resolved. The only remaining matters to be discussed are decisive issues, which should not be difficult to resolve. Representatives of all concerned countries may sign the new convention on Monday of next week and announce the closure of the conference. As for the unresolved decisive issues, there are three: (1) the issue of the survival of the Straits Management Committee. The Turkish government originally requested its abolition, and the United Kingdom is expected to agree. (2) The issue of aircraft of various countries flying over Turkish airspace. Turkey originally requested a ban, but because of the strong opposition from France and the United Kingdom, some concessions may be made so that the conference can adopt a compromise approach, namely, prohibiting aircraft from various countries from flying over military areas. (3) The Japanese amendment, which argues that the measures that the ten countries may take in accordance with Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant should be implemented only after the League of Nations Council has approved them with a two-thirds majority vote and the majority of the signatory countries of the new convention have also endorsed them. The conference has already satisfied this point in principle yesterday and is unlikely to cause disagreement again. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>Montreux - Since the Montreux Conference reconvened on the 6th of this month, the United Kingdom and Russia have been arguing for many days over the issue of warships of various countries passing through the Straits in wartime without a resolution. It was not until the afternoon of today that the Montreux Conference passed the Soviet amendment, and the points of contention between the United Kingdom and Russia were swept away. It is generally expected that the new convention can be signed at the end of this week or the beginning of next week. From then on, merchant ships of all countries, whether in war or peacetime, will be free to pass through the Straits. The French navy will also be able to obtain coal oil from Russia and Romania. It is also unknown whether France and Turkey will conclude a mutual assistance convention, as in the cases of the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Convention and the Balkan Entente. From this, it can be seen that the claims of France, Russia, and Romania have been victorious. As for the United Kingdom, its conciliatory attitude this time has been praised by the various delegations. The country had already made as many concessions as possible to the demands of other delegations. In addition, because the Russian Foreign Minister, Litvinov, insisted firmly, it became clear that the issue of blockading the Black Sea in wartime was a key point in Russia's plan and should be adhered to and never conceded. Therefore, [the UK] was unwilling to jeopardize the conference due to this dispute. And because there were many international conferences that ended in failure, if the Montreux Conference were to repeat the same mistake, or even if it did not fail but was postponed, it would be tantamount to a mental defeat for the countries that were loyal to the international rule of law. Therefore, [the UK] sacrificed itself and showed compromise to take care of the overall situation. When the vote was taken today, Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu had not returned home, so he did not vote. Japan and Yugoslavia had suggested to their respective governments that they support the Russian claim, but they still wanted to submit the full text of the Russian amendment to their respective governments for review, so they both abstained from voting. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Montreux - When the Montreux Conference voted on the Soviet amendment yesterday, the representatives of Japan and Yugoslavia both abstained from voting because they had to consult their respective governments. The Japanese delegation then submitted an amendment, which the conference immediately referred to the drafting committee for discussion in order to find a solution that would satisfy Japan and remove the difficulties that the Japanese amendment might cause in practice. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Montreux - The Soviet amendment has been passed by the Montreux Conference. When the vote was taken, Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu did not participate in the vote because he had already returned to his country, but the Romanian government has recently sent a telegram expressing its approval. Titulescu himself does not intend to come again because the conference is proceeding smoothly. As for the attitude of the Yugoslav government, it is still unknown. Observers believe that the Soviet amendment does not threaten the security of the Balkan Entente countries, and Yugoslavia will certainly express its approval. In addition, although Bulgaria had taken a reserved attitude on this matter, Yugoslavia had soothed it, and it is now expressing satisfaction. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>

What we see here is not only a sign of surrender but also a sign of the restoration of common sense. Moreover, Italy's economic victory this time is due to the efforts of all the people, young and old, male and female, who contributed to it. When the sanctions were implemented, our people did not panic or tremble, nor did they lose heart. Instead, they all prepared to sacrifice, because everyone held a belief that civilization and justice would ultimately prevail in both Europe and Africa."

<h3 id="e35">British Minister of Commerce Announces Progress in Various Industries; Sanctions Against Italy Resulted in a Loss of Four Million Pounds; Negotiations Are Underway to Restore Trade to Previous Levels <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(London) Minister of Commerce Runciman announced the recent commercial situation of Britain in the House of Commons today, stating that if there are no major developments overseas and if industrial peace in Britain can remain unchanged for a long time, then the progress made in the past few years has a great hope of continuing. British commercial policy remains unchanged, based on equal opportunities for all countries, but it will only be effective if all countries fulfill their responsibilities. Now, the unnatural restrictions and cumbersome examples that hinder multilateral international trade must be removed before the overseas trade that Britain enjoyed before the crisis of 1931 can gradually recover. The policy of developing overseas markets through commercial agreements is actively underway. In the coming period, British exporters' hopes will largely be focused on the continued expansion of intra-imperial trade and increased trade with the Sterling Area countries. However, looking at the global situation, there are still some exciting features. Statistics from the past few years have made us realize that although economic nationalism is growing daily, the prosperity of various countries rises and falls together. However, what is certain is that the progress of the gold bloc countries is still being hampered by special factors. Runciman then detailed the significant progress made by various major British industries in the past year, except for cotton and coal, stating that industries supplying the domestic market have made good progress in recent years, but export trade has progressed very slowly. Runciman then cited various statistics to prove the increase in the country's economic position, estimating that in June of this year, the number of insured unemployed who found work, excluding farmers, increased by 440,000 compared to a year ago, and the number of unemployed has decreased by 300,000. Although railway transportation faces competition from road transportation, the revenue for the first six months of this year increased by 1.83 million pounds compared to the same period last year, almost all of which was from freight revenue. Postal revenue also increased by 4% in six months. Retail sales best reflect the national situation, increasing by 6% in 1935 compared to the previous year, and continued to develop this year, with the value of goods in the first five months of this year increasing by 7.5% compared to 1935. Industrial products exported and sold domestically last year increased by 7% compared to 1934, and the first quarter of this year increased by 9% compared to the first quarter of last year. The merchant ships under construction at the end of June totaled 850,000 gross tons, compared to only 560,000 gross tons a year ago. Runciman continued, stating that sanctions against Italy caused Britain to lose 4 million pounds in exports to Italy in the first half of this year, but it is expected that it will be restored soon. The British authorities are in close contact with the Italian authorities to eliminate the obstacles to British trade with Italy as soon as possible. Runciman then described the situation of various major industries, stating that engineering continues to show signs of improvement, and there are several types, such as machine tools, where demand exceeds supply. Regarding electrical engineering, all aspects have continued to increase since 1935. The activity of various other industries can be seen from the huge demand for light and heavy electrical materials. The automobile industry also continues to thrive. From October last year to April this year, the production of passenger cars and chassis increased by more than 11% compared to the same period last year, while commercial vehicles increased by 10%. Although rayon is still a nascent industry, it has developed rapidly. Britain is now the largest producer of rayon yarn, and the export of rayon fabrics also ranks second in the world. The increase in sales of rayon does not hinder other textile industries but instead provides a valuable source of new raw materials for various textile industries. Runciman then analyzed the figures for overseas trade in the first half of this year, saying that although the increase in export trade in the first six months of 1936 compared to 1935 was not as rapid as in recent years, it still increased. The total value of exports from January to June 1935 was 206,500,000 pounds, which increased to 207,900,000 pounds in the same period this year. The increase in imports was even greater than that in exports. The import of food, beverages, and tobacco increased from 166,000,000 pounds to 179,000,000 pounds, while raw materials and unfinished goods increased from 103,000,000 pounds to 119,000,000 pounds, and finished or mostly finished goods increased from about 88,000,000 pounds to 101,000,000 pounds. Although exports only increased by 1,400,000 pounds, it should not be considered entirely unfavorable. The reason for the slow increase is partly due to the temporary complete cessation of export trade to Italy, which decreased by 4,000,000 pounds compared to the first half of last year. Although the trade deficit increased from 124,000,000 pounds to 162,000,000 pounds, it is not possible to predict any serious unfavorable balance of payments this year. The decline in international trade seems to have stopped and has slightly improved. Britain's position in world trade has clearly increased. In 1932, Britain accounted for 9.9% of world export trade, which increased to 10.8% in 1935. (Reuters, July 15)</p>

<p>(London) King Edward VIII, accompanied by his brother, the Duke of York, was returning to the palace from Hyde Park today when an unidentified assailant, intending to assassinate the King, attempted to fire a gun near the park. He was apprehended by police guarding the route, preventing him from firing the weapon. The King remained unharmed. The suspect is currently being interrogated by Scotland Yard. (National Telegram, July 16)</p>
<p>(London) Today, while King Edward VIII was riding from Buckingham Palace to Hyde Park to present colors to the Guards, an attempt was made to assassinate him. Fortunately, the handgun the assailant was holding was struck down just as he was aiming to fire. Four of the five chambers in the gun were loaded. The incident occurred near the Wellington Arch on Constitution Hill. The assailant, a British man, pushed through the crowd to the front row, and just as he was about to raise the gun, it was knocked out of his hand. The crowd surged forward, and the assailant turned to flee but was eventually exhausted and arrested. He was immediately taken to Hyde Park Police Station. The bullets in his gun were not fired. The man, wearing brown trousers and a collar, trembled violently after being captured. He has a disability in one foot and wears specially made leather boots. He has now been identified as George Andrew McMahon and will be arraigned this afternoon at Bow Street Magistrates' Court, where he is expected to be remanded for a week for further investigation. The suspect is charged with illegally carrying a weapon with intent to endanger life. Detectives presented the recovered handgun, discovering that four of its five chambers were loaded, with only the topmost chamber empty. According to his statement to detectives, "This is all the fault of Home Secretary Sir John Simon. I sent him a letter last night and spoke to him on the phone this morning. The King will not be harmed in any way. I had no intention of hurting him; I am only expressing a protest." This shocking incident, which has shaken the entire country, was witnessed by the Duke of York, who was riding behind the King as his personal aide-de-camp. Witnesses present at the scene all stated that the King remained very calm and his horse maintained its original speed. The King calmly looked around at the scene. The King and the Duke of York did not change their schedule for the day due to the incident. (Reuters, July 16)</p>
<p>(London) Today, King Edward VIII, accompanied by his brother, the Duke of York, was riding from Buckingham Palace when a shocking incident occurred at a corner in Hyde Park. A man attempted to break through the crowd lining the route and take action, but he was stopped on the spot and arrested. A handgun was found on the scene. The man will be prosecuted for political crimes. The King was not alarmed by the incident and proceeded as usual to Hyde Park, where he addressed the assembled guards, saying, "Humanity is now yearning for peace. Perhaps only a few of us gathered here this morning can truly understand the horrors of the World War twenty years ago. Though it contained much suffering, it was also filled with a spirit of mutual aid. It is my sincere hope and prayer that we will never again see such terrible times in our era. Humanity is now yearning for peace. In these peaceful days, you will find opportunities for fulfilling your duties and serving others, which are no less noble than what was demonstrated on the battlefield in the past." The ceremony took place in clear weather with bright sunshine. The new colors were received by the first and second battalions of the Grenadier Guards, the second and third battalions of the Coldstream Guards, and the second battalion of the Scots Guards. Cheering crowds stood along the route to watch the King and his brother, the Duke of York, ride to the parade ground. Queen Mary and other noble ladies also attended the ceremony. (Reuters, July 16)</p>
<p>(London) After a short stay at Buckingham Palace, the King traveled by car to St. James's Palace to review official documents. He then traveled by car to Belverdere Fort Villa to play golf. According to witnesses at the Wellington Arch, a mounted policeman's horse seemed to obstruct the assassin's view. While the assassin hesitated, his gun was knocked from his hand by a policeman and a woman standing nearby. The King's expression seemed to suddenly turn serious, and he turned his head to look at the people, seemingly searching for his equerry, Sir Aird. Sir Aird, who was riding behind with Lieutenant General White Rock, immediately returned to the scene and spoke to a policeman. A woman who was standing near the assassin said that the assassin seemed to have pushed forward from the fourth row behind us to the edge of the sidewalk. I heard someone shout, "Catch him, catch him!" As the assassin tried to break through the police cordon, a woman followed him. At the same time, the woman and the policeman knocked the gun from his hand onto the road. Another person said that when the assassin took out the gun, someone shouted and surrounded him. Just as the assassin was about to raise his gun, a policeman pushed his arm up, and then the surrounding crowd attacked him and threw him to the ground. Several officers of the Guards of the Duke of York also saw the whole incident. The Duke of York and the King were both unperturbed. When the assassin, McMahon, was arrested on the spot, another person rushed in front of the police and started a fight. That person was also arrested. Two women who witnessed the incident were taken to police headquarters in a police car. According to a photograph taken by a reporter, the assassin was being taken into an ambulance by three policemen. (Reuters, July 16)</p>
<p>(London) Police authorities issued a statement at 2:40 PM today, saying, "This morning, after the King presided over the flag-raising ceremony in Hyde Park, he immediately rode towards Buckingham Palace. When he reached near the Wellington Arch, a person suddenly jumped out of the crowd. The subsequent details are unclear, but a handgun, loaded with four bullets, fell to the ground between the King and his guards. No shots were heard. The police immediately arrested the person."

<p>(London) Home Secretary Simon made a statement in the House of Commons this afternoon regarding the incident involving the King. He first responded to a question from Labour MP Attlee, asking whether the Home Secretary could make a statement on the matter. Simon replied in a serious tone, saying, "This morning, as the King's entourage was returning to the palace from the flag-raising ceremony in Hyde Park, a person emerged from the crowd near the Wellington Arch on Constitution Hill and alarmed the royal entourage. The House of Commons is undoubtedly shocked by this news. The exact details of what happened are still unclear, but a handgun fell between the King and his accompanying soldiers. The person has been arrested and taken to Hyde Park Police Station. He did not fire the weapon, but the gun contained four bullets in its five chambers. The person will be arraigned at Bow Street Police Station this afternoon and is expected to be detained. The entire House is extremely grateful to God that the King escaped unharmed."

<h3 id="e38">Where Is the Hirota Cabinet Going? (1) <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Jia He</p>
<p>People call the Hirota Cabinet, which was appointed to form a cabinet, the "First Hirota Cabinet"; the cabinet that was interfered with by the military and changed its cabinet-forming policy is called the "Second Hirota Cabinet." If the above names are correct, then the Hirota Cabinet after the "Special Diet" should be called the "Third Hirota Cabinet." Because, "The mission of the First Cabinet was to purge the military internally and coordinate internationally, full of liberal colors, and the cabinet-forming staff was still the son-in-law of the quasi-elder Makino Nobuaki, and the current ambassador to the UK, Yoshida Shigeru. The Second Cabinet" was clearly constrained by the Army's deployment of the "military attache system" as a legitimate tactic. It abandoned liberal cabinet members, excluded political parties from occupying the Ministry of Home Affairs, and even made a secret oral agreement with the Army: to reform the political structure, to further control various industrial sectors, to increase the authority of the cabinet investigation bureau, which is the Army's tool cabinet, to expand armaments without limit, and to establish active autonomous diplomacy; as for the issue of military purge, that is the Army's internal affair and has nothing to do with outsiders. A cabinet of this nature, called "a new era for all government affairs, is essentially a radical fascist regime. If Hirota could carry it out one by one, then the "February 26th" coup would not have failed, but would have succeeded, because the souls of Shiro Nonaka and others are entirely attached to Hirota Koki. Naturally, that is absolutely impossible. The occurrence of the "February 26th" coup has its historical nature; the failure of the coup also lacks the objective conditions for success. If there is no objective need for the rise of radical fascism, even if the young military officers of Miyakesaka have the ability to move mountains and overturn seas, they will be powerless. Therefore, denying the actions of the "Second Cabinet" is an inevitable scene.</p>
<p>Since Hirota's mission to power was to continue to carry out the unfinished tasks of the Okada Cabinet, why did he make an oral agreement with the military? The reason is very simple: according to regulations, the Minister of the Army is a military officer. In the past, no matter which prime minister could recommend a responsible person from the military other than a military officer, and Hirota was naturally no exception. Furthermore, according to precedent, the Minister of the Army was not something that the Prime Minister could freely recommend; it was always decided by the Chief of the General Staff, the Inspector General of Military Education, and the previous Minister of the Army, the so-called three chiefs of the Army, and then submitted to the Emperor for appointment. Hirota after the coup could not even think about breaking this precedent. Under the above premise, Hirota's cabinet, who would rather pull in Terauchi Juichi than listen to Araki Sadao and others, it cannot be said that this was his intelligence. Because General Terauchi is not only the descendant of Terauchi Masatake, the so-called leader of the long-standing faction within the Army, but also a count with great skills in maneuvering. In the camp of the Kansai financial clique, he, together with Generals Ugaki Kazushige and Abe Nobuyuki, can obtain equal votes of confidence. Secondly, in Hirota's view, the political skills of the young military officers were quite naive. Bearing the responsibility for the coup that disturbed the Emperor, they did not strive to clear their names but only focused on making an oral agreement to form a cabinet, leaving the difficulties of the special Diet behind. They did not know that since parliamentary politics cannot be closed, the power of the parliament can not only direct the cabinet but also control the military. Making an oral agreement is secret, but there are public opportunities to deny the oral agreement, so what is Hirota afraid of? Thirdly, the constitution states that the military cannot directly interfere in politics. If the military wants to fulfill the requested oral agreement, it can only take indirect means. The young military officers also understand this very well. Therefore, their friendship with Hirota led to the expansion of the authority of the Cabinet Investigation Bureau into a small cabinet within the cabinet, and the chief, Yoshida Shigeru (a different person from the current ambassador to the UK), was promoted to Minister without Portfolio. However, Hirota did not have this power and should wait for a cabinet decision. The cabinet decision was made after the cabinet was formed. Before the cabinet was formed, the current problem was not to fulfill the demands of the military but that the military and Hirota were busy dealing with the special Diet. The special Diet has such power, not only because it holds a written constitution, but because the economic center of Japan is in the hands of the bourgeoisie. (Landlords and nobles have become bourgeois since the Southwest War. Only those who are ignorant of Japanese history believe that Japan still has a huge feudal force. They regard the military as a feudal force, as a feudal force that can resist the propertied class, which is also wrong. Because the divisions within the Army and Navy are a reflection of the propertied class fighting secretly for profit. The remaining feudal forces are not enough to influence the entire political situation in Japan.) On the eve of the Meiji Restoration, the anger of Osaka merchants changed the colors of the daimyo (feudal lords). Not to mention the power of Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda today is a thousand times greater than the "kuramoto" and "zakahai" of the past, and even the "Konoike of the world" is more雄大万倍; and the leaders of the military are not enough to be compared with the feudal daimyo. For the above-mentioned reasons, Hirota dared to make an oral agreement with Terauchi to overcome the difficulties of forming a cabinet.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Increased Destroyer Proposal: Britain Notifies the US and Japan of the London Treaty's "Escalator Clause" <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>(London) Britain has formally invoked the "escalator clause" of the 1930 London Naval Treaty in order to retain 40,000 tons of overage destroyers that should be scrapped by the end of the year. The British government sent this document to the US and Japanese ambassadors last night to convey it to their respective governments. Naval experts today believe that recent foreign naval developments make it necessary for Britain to invoke this clause. According to the clause, any signatory country that believes its national security is seriously threatened by the construction of new ships by non-signatory countries may increase its tonnage after notifying other signatory countries, and other signatory countries may also make proportional increases. The issue of retaining the Hawkins-class cruisers is still under discussion by the British, Japanese, and American governments. It is heard that the British government has sent another note to the Japanese and American ambassadors regarding this issue. These cruisers are the Hawkins (9,800 tons), the Effingham (9,770 tons), and the Frobisher (9,860 tons). The British government plans to改造or re-equip these three ships. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Since the British government notified the US and Japan that it had decided to invoke Article 21, the "escalator" clauses of the London Naval Treaty, in order to preserve 190,000 tons of destroyers, the US government should follow suit and additionally preserve 40,000 tons of destroyers in order to seek reciprocity. Regarding this, naval figures found it strange that the British government's announcement did not mention the issue of cruiser tonnage, which was inconsistent with the announcement made in May of this year, but they still praised it, saying that this move could provide a solution to the issue of additional destroyer tonnage preservation without any ambiguity. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Britain has decided to retain an overage of 40,000 tons of destroyers and has notified Japan and the United States of its intention to invoke the escalation clause. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received this telegram. It may arrive in the near future, and at that time, after the contents of the British notification are transferred to the two overseas provinces for consultation, a reply can be given. Japan has largely understood Britain's request. It is confirmed that Japan's fundamental position is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) If Britain invokes the escalation clause, the corresponding ship type that Japan should obtain does not have a corresponding treaty overage for retaining destroyers, so it can obtain a submarine tonnage.</p>
<p>(2) Although Japan maintains its current submarine tonnage, the London Treaty expires at the end of this year, so it is more in line with the spirit of naval arms reduction to maintain old ships rather than build new ones.</p>
<p>(3) Moreover, although Japan retains its destroyers and submarines that should be scrapped, they are mostly old ships, so they will not pose a threat to Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>(4) Britain believes that maintaining the Hawkins-class cruisers should not be considered a violation of the treaty. However, regarding the interpretation of Article 19 of the London Treaty, in the exchange of official documents between Britain, Japan, and the United States, cruisers are divided into ship types and ship classes, and there is a clear distinction between A-class and B-class. Therefore, Britain's claim to apply A-class to B-class as the same ship type is a violation of the treaty. (Domei, 16th)</p>

(Domei, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Border Dispute Resolution Committee and the Manchukuo-Russia Border Demarcation Committee, which aim to prevent conflicts on the Manchukuo-Russia border and clarify Japan-Russia relations, have been created by the Japanese side, so the Director of the Eurasian Bureau, Togo, invited Labet, the Counselor of the Soviet Russian Embassy, ​​to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11 a.m. on the 16th to hold the first Shanghai talk. First, the Director of the Eurasian Bureau, Togo, presented the Japanese concrete plan and explained it in detail, and the Counselor of the Eurasian Bureau, Togo, said that the Japanese proposal was quite broad and needed to be fully reviewed and that he needed to consult with his country's government before scheduling a meeting to discuss it. Therefore, there was no deliberation on the specific plan. After leaving at 12:30 p.m., it was decided that the meeting should be held after receiving instructions from the Soviet Russian side. (Domei, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government's policy on the Soviet Russian government's proposal to establish two committees, one for border demarcation and one for dispute resolution, is as follows: (1) The border demarcation must be based on the 1861 Beijing Treaty, the 1886 Hunchun Convention, and the 1861 Xingkai Lake Convention, and the investigation work must be promoted from south to north. (2) The issue of dispute resolution should focus on the particularity of the Russia-Manchukuo border. (Domei, 16th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Acting Secretary of the Navy and Director of Naval Allocations Admiral Stanley said today that after the case of retired naval officer Farnsworth selling US naval secrets to Japanese naval representatives was cracked, US naval strategy may be greatly changed. The book sold by Farnsworth was actually a tactical textbook for the commanders of each fleet. The book was printed in 1916 and only naval officers could purchase it. However, after each fleet exercise every year, senior naval officers would make revisions, so the latest revised version contains the latest operational strategies. Stanley would not disclose whether the current espionage case involved others, but said that the Navy Department was not overly surprised by the various acts of foreign spies, because after any country increases its military power, other countries' governments want to know its secrets. At the same time, the Department of Justice is doing its best to investigate whether Farnsworth has any accomplices. Federal agents are currently searching everywhere. If Japanese are involved, officials here said that they have not yet decided what action to take. If the Japanese involved are actually embassy officials, then the United States may formally ask the Japanese government to recall these personnel. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Agricultural Experiment Station has discovered a type of woody soybean in Yunnan Province, which is a perennial plant that can bear fruit twice a year. It can be used to make tofu and extract oil, and has a wide range of uses. It is currently being tested for planting, and the Central Industrial Experiment Institute has been requested to conduct tests. The results show that its oil content is 3.5%, which is not as high as that of ordinary soybeans. It is not very economical to extract oil from it, but it is rich in protein and carbohydrates, which can be used as food or to brew soy sauce. (Central News Agency, 16th)</p>

<p>— By Our Reporters, Hu Zhongchi and Hu Yizang</p>
<p>Equally commendable as this artistic sensibility are the Japanese people's politeness and human touch. We experienced this at the inn in Kobe. We were Chinese and new to such inns, but we did not feel the trouble of being strangers in a strange land. The innkeeper was very attentive and polite, and the waitresses who served us were also very endearing. Although they were poor farm girls, they had none of the rude manners. They were both generous and clever. They spoke to us with the utmost respect. At first, she brought tea sets and a fruit box filled with Kobe's specialty, "tile crackers," and knelt beside us to pour tea respectfully. Later, at mealtime, she knelt down to serve us rice, putting the rice bowl on a wooden tray and handing it to us as if offering a sacrifice. When entering and leaving the door, she always bowed. At night, she made up the cotton quilt for us, asked if there was anything else we needed, and then said good night and walked out.</p>
<p>The waitresses in the inns belong to the oppressed class of Japan. Their respectful politeness can also be said to be due to their profession. However, the fundamental reason is still in the traditional moral habits of Japan. People of all classes in Japan, whether men or women, have always been particular about politeness. Bows are always forty degrees. There are also many honorifics in the language. This humble politeness, which represents the inherent morality of Japan, along with the inherent art of Japan, was praised by Lafcadio Hearn (a deceased British writer who lived in Japan for a long time) with the highest adjectives. In today's era, these two are still worthy of our praise. These two symbolize the spirit of ancient Japan, that is, the spirit of peaceful Japan; only with this spirit can the feelings of China and Japan be reconciled.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, this lovely spirit of ancient Japan has begun to waver. Because since Western, especially German, civilization was introduced to Japan, a new spirit has gradually swelled up to eliminate that lovely traditional spirit. Our life in the Kobe inn made us feel that way in practice. We were sitting cross-legged on the mats, admiring the simple beauty of the purely Japanese-style interior decoration, as well as the polite and gentle demeanor of the maid who served us, and enjoying the leisurely and peaceful taste expressed by the inscription on the plaque, when suddenly a rumbling giant feast came over, shaking the entire house we were living in, and all the windows rattled. Then we shattered the previous daydream and realized that we were in a noisy international city. We looked out the window and saw a rapidly running train passing over the elevated railway opposite us. The Kobe elevated railway has not been completed for long. The rails are laid on steel and cement viaducts that are two meters high, with evenly arranged piers, in the middle of which buildings can be built or roads can be opened. Now this elevated railway has directly connected to Osaka. It only takes twenty-eight minutes to get there by taking the limited express train from Sannomiya Station in Kobe.</p>
<p>Huge and amazing construction projects such as elevated railways and subways have been developing very rapidly in Japan in recent years. This is not necessarily due to the needs of industrial development. The fundamental reason is first in the competitive psychology of Japanese imperialists. They not only want to compete with other powerful countries in armaments. Even in urban construction, when they see what amazing constructions are in the big cities such as New York and London, they have to follow suit, no matter how heavy the burden on their own people. The second is that in recent years, the tide of the world economic panic has left the capital of Japan's major financial groups with no proper outlet. They have to use huge public construction projects to absorb excess capital, excess labor, and excess industrial materials.</p>
<p>The material civilization of Japan, from the surface of the city, has indeed reached a very high level. However, the general public can only firmly maintain an extremely simple traditional life in terms of clothing, food, and housing. In the inn in Kobe, we also enjoyed that kind of life.</p>
<p>We took a bath in the inn's bathroom in the Japanese way, changed into a set of kimonos specially prepared by the inn, and returned to our room, which was covered with twelve mats and had a small table and a charcoal brazier in the middle. After resting for a while, the maid brought in dinner. So we each ate from a lacquered tray with four short legs. The lacquer tray contained various kinds of bowls and plates, filled with raw fish, grilled fish, fish soup, and two slices of yellow radish and a small handful of half-cooked green vegetables. These Japanese dishes were all cooked very simply, and they were not very palatable to us, who were used to greasy Chinese dishes. The dark red raw fish is considered a Japanese delicacy, but we disliked the fishy smell, so we poured boiling water on it and ate it, and then we felt a little taste.</p>

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the Kuomintang Second Plenary Session resolved to send Yu Hanmou back to Guangdong to reorganize military affairs and abolish the Southwest Executive Department and the Political Affairs Conference, the generals held a plenary conference at the Yantang Military and Political School on the evening of the 13th. Chen Jitang attended and reported that the central government had telegraphed to persuade him to go to Beijing. After deliberation, it was decided that Chen would remain in Guangdong to oversee military affairs. From then on, the Guangdong armies on the Guangdong-Fujian and Guangdong-Hunan borders began to shorten their defense lines, and the northeastern and Guangdong military situation became exceptionally tense. It is also reported that after Yu Hanmou returned to Dayu, the First Division of the First Army, under Li Zhenqiu, had begun to move south from Nanxiong and was heading towards Shixing. The Second and Third Divisions, under Ye and Zhang respectively, also followed closely behind. It is said that Yu has commanded the First Army's three divisions (Li, Ye, and Zhang) back to Guangdong to clean up the Guangdong situation. Therefore, Yu is currently preparing to march straight to Shaozhou, following the southern section of the Yuehan Railway to Guangzhou. On the 14th, the three divisions (4th, 5th, and 6th) of the Second Guangdong Army, under Zhang Da, were ordered by Chen Jitang to withdraw from Pingshi, Jiufeng, and Renhua to guard Shaozhou, with Shixing as the first defense line, Shaozhou as the second defense line, and Yingde as the third defense line. The Second Army is also the vanguard against Yu's army. The 14th and 15th Divisions of the Fifth Army are firmly defending from Shaoguan down to Yingde. The regiments of the 13th Division of the Fifth Army are guarding the outskirts of the provincial capital, extending to Conghua, Qingyuan, Yuantan, and Wengyuan, to coordinate with the Eastern Guangdong Army. As for the Guangdong army on the Fujian-Guangdong border, they are also withdrawing to the interior of Eastern Guangdong. The Fourth Army, under Huang Renhuan, is withdrawing to Meixian, Jiaoling, and Pingyuan counties. The Third Army, under Li Yangjing, is withdrawing to Xingning, Heping, Lianping, Heyuan, Zengcheng, and Longmen counties. Newly formed garrison troops are deployed in Shantou and coastal areas. Generally, all the elite troops of the Guangdong army are concentrated in the northeast of the provincial capital, purely adopting an interior defense strategy to avoid spreading their forces too thinly. It is expected that once the war breaks out, the people of Guangdong will feel even more hardship. If the war continues, the suffering will be unimaginable. (July 15th)</p>

The hearse for transporting the coffin was specially purchased from abroad, about thirteen feet long and seven feet wide. Rails are laid inside the car for moving the coffin up and down. The four sides of the car are decorated with black glass windows and doors. White cloths and white silk balls are attached to the car door. There are also water-patterned white silk ribbons around both sides of the car. The outer railing of the car is decorated with blue satin, which is extremely simple. Hu's portrait is also specially made, more than ten feet high and six feet wide, with Hu's portrait hanging inside. There are sixteen porters in front and behind the bier.</p>

A farewell place had been prepared there in advance. Officials from various agencies, representatives from various groups, and students from various schools all held a farewell ceremony there.

<p>Xiamen Correspondence: In recent years, due to the decline of industry and commerce and frequent disasters in Fujian Province, many people have lost their jobs. Laborers have flocked to foreign countries to make a living. Taiwan happened to increase the production of military, industrial raw materials, and minerals, and needed labor. Therefore, they came to Fujian to recruit laborers from Putian, Fuqing, and Wenzhou in Zhejiang to go to Taiwan. According to Taiwan news, according to the statistics of the Taiwan Governor's Office, more than 7,000 Chinese laborers came to Taiwan from January to the end of June this year. These Chinese laborers are more able to endure hardship than Japanese and Taiwanese, and their wages are also lower. Therefore, many mines, factories, and shops are happy to use them. As a result, Taiwanese laborers have been greatly affected. The number of unemployed workers has recently increased to 10,000. If this continues, the number of unemployed will inevitably increase. The Taiwan Governor's Office then ordered the Foreign Affairs Section and the Security Section to coordinate countermeasures. As a result, it was decided to restrict the entry of Chinese laborers and immediately ordered the Nanguo Company, which specializes in handling the procedures for Chinese laborers to go to Taiwan, to do so. Taiwan recruits Chinese laborers when they need them, fearing that they will not come. When they feel they have too many, they refuse them, fearing that they will not be able to get rid of them.

<p>In Li Tahuixiang, a district, there is Wan Da Distilling Workshop, which is a branch of Wan Shen Distilling Workshop in Cangqiao Beach in this city. At about 10 pm last night (the 15th), seven bandits suddenly entered the workshop through the back door. Four of them carried handguns and searched, while the other three carried flashlights, water sticks, and iron rulers to keep watch outside. While they were robbing, a small teahouse next to Wan Da was still gambling. Just as the stakes were high, a gambler opened the door to urinate and saw the bandit on watch. Mistaking him for a police officer catching gamblers, he returned to tell his gambling friends. Everyone went up to the roof to escape. There was chaos for a while, which made the bandits mistakenly think they were being arrested. They hurriedly tried to escape, and in the chaos, they dropped two handguns and one bullet. They fired four shots in the air to show their power before escaping. It is reported that Wan Da Distilling Workshop was robbed of a pair of gold rings, weighing one mace and five fen, more than 20,000 copper coins, and clothes. After the incident, the manager Lang Songquan reported it to the patrol station for investigation. The misunderstanding between the two parties disrupted the robbery case, which was a fortunate misfortune.</p>

<p>The silk factory strike in the county was originally scheduled to resume work on the 15th. Unexpectedly, a change occurred at the time of resumption. At about 9:00 pm that night, Wu Zhengrong, the director of political affairs, arrested Zhou Dechang (aka Zhou Sanbao), a suspect who instigated the strike, at No. 31 Cotton Alley outside the South Gate, and sent him to the county for detention to await transfer to the special commissioner's office for investigation. County Magistrate Long Tiyao, in order to quickly resolve the strike, summoned more than ten representatives of the silk factory trade association, including Qian Fenghao, Hua Shaochun, Zheng Haiquan, and Xue Zukang, to the county for talks and discussed the issue of guaranteeing the resumption of work. County Magistrate Long deeply regretted the failure to resume work on the 15th and said that he had implemented considerable vigilance and hoped that the resumption of work could be unified by the 17th at the latest and that there should be no more disturbances. At this point, the representatives resigned and left. On the 16th, the county party department also issued a notice to the workers, advising them to resume work. The county chamber of commerce reported the process of the strike to the provincial government for approval. At 5:00 pm, County Magistrate Long again summoned representatives of the employers to mediate and limited the resumption of business to the 17th. The losses amounted to more than 19,000 yuan. The Public Security Bureau arrested female worker Cai Mei again yesterday and sent her to the county and then to the special commissioner's office for disposal.</p>

<p>Recently, the Xihu Automobile Company stopped the special Changshu-Shanghai express bus due to the peak of summer and few passengers, and also submitted a portion of the vehicles for cancellation to save money. According to company sources, the daily income of each station on the Xihu main and branch lines is more than 1,600 yuan, but the expenditure reaches more than 1,400 yuan. On the surface, it seems to have a surplus, but because the company is heavily in debt, it is not enough to compensate. Therefore, the above-mentioned contraction has occurred. Recently, the Yangfu Road branch line is about to be completed. This line is also within the company's profit scope. However, the towns passed through are all small wharfs, and the company believes that there is not much profit in business or that it may not be able to maintain road maintenance costs. Therefore, the decision on opening the road is still pending.</p>

<p>The adopted son of Zhou Liu in Dingshe Town, the seventh district of Wujin, was kidnapped by bandits in 1932. After investigation, the investigation agency successively arrested four criminals: Ding Heshang, Zhu Pansheng, Zhu Peichang, and Wu Kunda. Ding Heshang and Zhu Pansheng were sentenced to death and executed by shooting. Zhu Peichang and Wu Kunda were sentenced by the court to 13 years of imprisonment and are currently serving their sentences. However, the main perpetrator of this case was Yang Weiquan, who had been hiding elsewhere and had not been arrested. Unexpectedly, thinking that five years had passed and he could be carefree, he suddenly returned to his hometown and hid in Yangjia Village in Qianheng Town. After receiving a report, the detective team of the Public Security Bureau immediately sent detectives such as Zhang Yuanxing to search and arrest him. He was arrested at Deng Canjin's house and taken to the county government for further investigation on the afternoon of the 15th.</p>

<p>Taihu Lake is originally a flood storage area in Jiangnan, benefiting agricultural irrigation greatly. In recent years, it has gradually become silted up, resulting in a shrinking capacity. Last spring, guest residents extensively reclaimed land in East Taihu Lake, causing a huge storm that lasted for half a year before it subsided. In addition to the Finance Department starting to clear official property, the East Taihu Lake waterfront water conservancy project is also extremely important. In view of this, the Jiangsu Construction Department will, in accordance with the general outline for preventing land reclamation, jointly survey and measure the project with the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Committee and discuss the design principles. It is planned to complete this project in stages within this year.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Solar Eclipse <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Central Broadcasting · Lecture Manuscript Yu Qingsong</p>
<p>Esteemed listeners, the most significant astronomical phenomenon this year, capable of mobilizing astronomers, physicists, and meteorologists worldwide, is the total solar eclipse on June 19th. In the history of Chinese astronomy, this eclipse is particularly memorable because it marks the first time China sent representatives to observe a solar eclipse alongside renowned international astronomers. I am fortunate to be one of those participants, so today I will briefly share the observation process and the general significance of observing a solar eclipse with you all.</p>
<p>We know that solar and lunar eclipses are merely celestial phenomena resulting from the alignment of the Earth, Sun, and Moon. When the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, it blocks a portion of the sunlight from reaching the Earth, causing a solar eclipse. Therefore, a solar eclipse always occurs during the new moon (the first day of the lunar month). When the Moon's umbral cone falls on a particular location, a total solar eclipse occurs, where the Sun is completely obscured. While solar eclipses always happen during new moons, not every new moon results in a solar eclipse. This is due to the relative positions of the Earth and Moon's orbits. As for the frequency of solar eclipses, statistical results show that there are 8,000 occurrences in 3,368 years, averaging 237 solar eclipses per century. Among these, 66 are total eclipses. This is for the entire Earth. Assuming China occupies two percent of the Earth's surface, the probability of a total eclipse's center falling within China is, on average, once per century. Examining this more closely, we know that from 1542 (the 21st year of the Ming Dynasty's Jiajing era) to the present, nearly 400 years, there have been a total of 26 total solar eclipses passing over China. From this year onward, there will be 10 total solar eclipses visible in China within a century. However, only four of these will occur around midday in the past four centuries, and only one in the next century. Further specifying that it crosses the densely populated areas around the Yellow River and Yangtze River, and is visible in the central region of the mainland near midday, there have only been two such occurrences in 500 years. One was on August 11, 1542 (the 7th lunar month of the 21st year of the Ming Dynasty's Jiajing era, Ji-You day) at noon, with the eclipse over the Yellow River basin. The other was on September 21, 1941 (the 30th year of the Republic of China) at noon, with the eclipse over the Yangtze River basin. These two total eclipses are almost exactly 400 years apart, making such an opportunity incredibly rare.</p>
<p>What exactly happens during a total solar eclipse? Based on what I witnessed this time in Hokkaido, Japan, as the Sun is gradually obscured by the Moon, sunlight gradually diminishes. When the Sun is almost entirely hidden, a particularly bright light appears at its edge, resembling a diamond ring. Instantly, this brilliant section vanishes, and an extremely bright halo appears around the Sun, known as the corona. This corona's appearance varies each time. This time, the corona was pentagonal in shape, its length nearly the same as the Sun's diameter. Simultaneously, between the dark Sun's edge and the corona, there were five solar prominences, red flames. Three were scattered individually, and two were clustered together. Near the Sun, a very bright star, Venus, was also visible. These phenomena lasted for one minute and fifty-odd seconds, then completely disappeared, and sunlight gradually brightened again. During totality, the overall brightness was similar to that of a full moon. However, the light during a full moon is white, while the light during totality is yellowish-green, making it seem darker. Shortly before totality, many crows were seen flying back to their nests, and about twenty minutes after totality, we heard roosters crowing, as they mistook the event for dawn.</p>
<p>The duration of totality is at most seven minutes. This time I saw one minute and fifty-odd seconds. About six years ago, the total eclipse seen near San Francisco, USA, lasted only one and a half seconds. As for the total eclipse visible in China on September 21, 1941 (the 30th year of the Republic of China), it could last up to three minutes and twenty seconds in one location. For such a short period of time, astronomers, physicists, and meteorologists worldwide spend hundreds of thousands of dollars and endure arduous journeys to observe and study these phenomena. For example, for this solar eclipse, most European astronomers gathered in western Soviet Union. In Hokkaido, Japan, virtually all Japanese astronomers, physicists, and meteorologists, regardless of age, participated, forming thirty-eight teams totaling one hundred and seventy people. The government increased the budget by hundreds of thousands of yen. Besides Chinese teams, there were also observation teams from Britain, the United States, Poland, Czechoslovakia, India, and so on. Why spend so much money and involve scholars worldwide for such a short period? It is because observing this phenomenon provides many opportunities for scientific research. I will now discuss the most important of these:</p>
<p>(1) Determining the relative positions of the Sun and Moon.</p>
<p>(2) Capturing images of the sky near the Sun to determine the existence of planets within Mercury's orbit and observing the bending of starlight passing near the Sun's edge, providing data for the study of general relativity.</p>
<p>(3) Taking photographs of the corona and prominences to study their changes.</p>
<p>(4) Conducting spectroscopic observations of the inversion layer, photosphere, and corona.</p>
<p>(5) Measuring the light intensity of the corona.</p>
<p>(6) Measuring the radiant heat of the corona.</p>
<p>(7) Measuring the polarization of light from the corona.</p>
<p>(8) Observing changes in various meteorological elements, magnetic influences, radio wave effects, and so on as the eclipse intensifies.</p>
<p>In short, observing solar eclipses can not only solve astronomical problems but also contribute to research in physics and meteorology. Because of its significant scientific value, each time there is a total solar eclipse, governments spend hundreds of thousands of dollars or dispatch warships to escort observation teams to their destinations for observation. However, if it rains, all efforts are in vain. For example, among the observation teams in Hokkaido this time, the British team had the most and largest equipment. The observation personnel arrived at the destination from Britain in early May and spent over a month preparing. Unfortunately, due to clouds during the eclipse, they could not observe it. The Chinese observation team dispatched to Boli (Khabarovsk) in the Soviet Union also encountered the same misfortune.</p>
<p>The goals of China's dispatch of an observation team this time were roughly threefold. First, to capture images of the corona to study its light intensity changes. As a result, three satisfactory photographs of the corona were taken. Second, to gather reference data for the solar eclipse visible in China on September 21, 1941 (the 30th year of the Republic of China). Much experience was gained. Third, to enhance the general public's knowledge, so three sets of films were taken, which will be publicly screened in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group Set Sail Yesterday Morning on Dutch Vessel · Enthusiastic Farewell from All Sectors · Returning to Country After Three-Month Inspection · Carrying Over One Hundred Boxes of Domestic Products in Preparation for Exhibition <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group organized by the China National Industries Overseas Trade Association, a party of fifteen led by the head and deputy heads Gao Shiheng and Hu Shicheng, set sail yesterday morning at half past ten o'clock on the Java Mailboat Company's Zhini Geila Wheel. More than a hundred representatives from all walks of life went to see them off. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Embarking on the Voyage</p>
<p>The group included head Gao Shiheng, deputy head Hu Shicheng, chief secretary Zhang Zuyin, Shanghai accountant Zhuang Maoru, public relations Xu Xuejie, secretary Yang Chonggao, and members Li Shenyan, Lu Zixian, Deng Qiyao, Xu Zhaolin, Jiang Junrui, Gao Juxin, Zhou Guojun, Wang Gongquan, Zhu Qizu, and others, fifteen in total. All wore white drill suits, gray pith helmets, black ties, and black leather shoes, appearing neat and spirited. At half past eight yesterday morning, they gathered at the New Customs Wharf and boarded the Java Shipping Company's passenger launch, crossing the river to the Pootung Blue Funnel Wharf to board the Zhini Geila Wheel. The vessel weighed anchor at half past ten in the morning.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Farewell</p>
<p>Those who went to see them off included representatives from the Machine-Made National Products Factories Joint Association, the Shanghai National Products Movement Joint Association, the National Products Production and Sales Association, the China National Industries Overseas Trade Association, as well as representatives from the Meyer Silk Weaving Factory, Huachang Enamelware Factory, Washeng Electric Appliance Factory, Home Industry Cooperative, Xingye Ceramic Tile Company, Yongzhou Paint Company, and others, including Hu Xiyuan, Cai Shengbai, Zhang Huikang, Huang Renzhi, Xu Xiaochu, Wang Xingyao, Cheng Shouchung, Xiang Kangyuan, Ye Youcai, and relatives and friends of the group members, totaling over a hundred people, creating a very enthusiastic scene.</p>
<p>Carrying Products</p>
<p>Prior to this trip, the group also separately solicited national products from over thirty national product factories, such as Meyer, Huachang, Washeng, Yukang, Sino-French, Tianyuan, Kangyuan, Home Industry Cooperative, and others. These included products such as silk fabrics, felt hats, straw hats, porcelain, electrical appliances, cosmetics, medicines, enamelware, native cloth, and various daily necessities, totaling several hundred varieties, packed into over one hundred and fifty boxes. On the evening of the 15th, they were entrusted to the China Travel Service to be transported and loaded onto the Zhini Geila Wheel, to be taken by the group. They will be exhibited in various ports in Nanyang in turn, to promote national products and develop the national product market in Nanyang. At the same time, the group also carried five thousand copies of a special publication compiled and printed by the group, to be distributed to the business community in various ports for reference.</p>
<p>Remarks by the Head</p>
<p>According to the group head Gao Shiheng at the New Customs Wharf, the day before yesterday he and Chairman Zhang Huikang went to the capital to pay respects to Executive Yuan President Chiang Kai-shek. Secretary-General Weng Wenhao stood in for the meeting with National Government Chairman Lin Sen, and Chief of the Civil Affairs Department Wei Huai stood in. Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang and Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Qun were met. He returned to Shanghai last night. Minister Zhang promised to immediately telegraph Chinese consuls in Singapore and other places to guide them at the time. Minister Wu immediately filled out the 5,000-yuan subsidy. The purpose of this trip is to inspect the commercial situation in various places in Nanyang, to serve as a basis for development, and to strive to improve the quality and manufacturing methods of national products, to prepare for foreign trade. The group's total expenditure is estimated at 50,000 yuan. In addition to the 5,000-yuan subsidy from the Ministry of Industry, the remainder will be borne by the participating factories. The inspection sites are planned to be Manila, Surabaya, Batavia, Singapore, Penang, Siam, Medan, and other seven locations. At each location, they will stay for ten days or half a month to hold national product circulation exhibitions (detailed schedules have been published in various newspapers previously, so I will not repeat them). The inspection period is three months, scheduled to return to the country at the end of October or the beginning of November, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Sun Ke Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday and Said · Turmoil in Guangdong and Guangxi Can Be Resolved Soon · Telegraphed Xiao Focheng Yesterday Urging Him to Go North <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, President of the Legislative Yuan Sun Ke left Beijing by overnight train the night before last at 11:00 PM and arrived at Zhenru Station at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning. He immediately returned to his private residence on Columbia Road to rest. He then went out to visit friends until noon before returning to his residence for lunch. Also arriving in Shanghai with Sun yesterday morning were Central Committee members Chu Minyi, Bo Wenwei, and Zhang Dingfan. Sun is scheduled to go to Lushan for a summer retreat within the next few days. The date of his departure has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Sun's Remarks</p>
<p>According to Sun, the resolution of the Guangdong and Guangxi turmoil will not exceed one month. Although Chen Jitang has not yet realized his errors, his subordinates can prioritize the nation and the people, surrendering to the Central Government and resisting the rebellion. Chen Jitang's failure is already a foregone conclusion. When Guangdong and Guangxi held military conferences, the generals were concerned about the defense of the coast after their troops moved north, while Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and Chen Weizhou claimed that they had reached an agreement on the Japanese issue and that the Japanese could help them resist the Central Government. Zhang Ruigui, commander of the 2nd Division of the 1st Army, said that the front was ostensibly resisting Japan, while the rear was actually collaborating with Japan. Such resistance was difficult to support, and Zhang immediately resigned from his position as division commander. Zhang Ruigui was a trusted confidant of Chen Jitang and has now also surrendered to the Central Government and is resisting Chen Jitang's rebellion. Chen Jitang's current situation is clear from this. Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi are still unrepentant and resisting the Central Government's orders, and war seems unavoidable. However, based on my observation, the war will be completely resolved within one month. After this, China will be able to achieve true unification. The Hong Kong telegram reported that the Southwest will convene a so-called emergency meeting of the Central Executive Committee. Xiao Focheng and Chen Rong, who remained in Guangdong, have both discerned the treacherous plot and refused to listen, and have left Guangdong one after another. If the Hong Kong telegram is accurate, they will only collude with the Third Party and the State Socialist Party, seeking to carry out their conspiracy to disrupt.</p>
<p>Welcoming Xiao to the North</p>
<p>Sun had previously telegraphed Chen Jitang inviting him to Beijing and telegraphed Xiao Focheng urging him to go north together. Sun learned yesterday that Xiao had already left Guangdong for Hong Kong, so he sent a special telegram to Hong Kong welcoming him to the north. His original telegram stated, "Transmitted to Committee Member Xiao Focheng, Hong Kong Telegraph Office: Having arrived in Shanghai this morning from Beijing and read the newspaper, I am exceedingly pleased that you have left Guangdong for Hong Kong. I earnestly hope you will come north to discuss the aftermath of the Guangdong situation. Colleagues in the Central Government are unanimously and eagerly welcoming you. I send my regards and wish you good health. Sun Ke, bow."</p>

<p>The Ministry of Judicial Administration, in order to plan the improvement of forensic medicine and assist in solving difficult forensic medical problems, has specially established a Forensic Medicine Review Board, hiring domestic medical experts to serve in groups. The inaugural meeting was held on the 11th of this month at the Bankers' Association in this city. Minister Wang was unable to attend due to attending the Second Plenary Session, so he specially dispatched Zheng Yue, Chief Prosecutor of the Jiangsu High Court Second Branch, and Zhao Shibei, Chief Prosecutor of the High Court Third Branch, to deliver congratulatory speeches on his behalf. The details of the meeting are recorded below.</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>Those present: Zeng Guangfang, Zhao Chengxia, Kuang Ankun, Liang Hanfen, Le Wenzhao, Weng Zhilong, Liu Yongchun, Cheng Muyi, Chen Hongkang, Zhu Hengbi, Niu Huisheng (representing Sun), Shen Chengwu, Guo Qiyuan, Pan Chenggao, Yan Fuching, Li Qingmao, Fu Wenshou, Sun Dafang, Zheng Yue and Zhao Shibei representing the Ministry of Judicial Administration, Chairman Sun Kuifang, recorders Chen Renjun and Zu Zhaoji.</p>
<p>Meeting Proceedings</p>
<p>The meeting was opened as scheduled. The chairman delivered an opening speech, stating in essence: "Today is the day of the establishment of the Forensic Medicine Review Board of the Ministry of Judicial Administration. I should use simple language to announce the purpose of the meeting. As civilization advances, the methods of committing crimes become more complex, and the scope of forensic medicine also expands accordingly. Today, the identification of cases in forensic medicine requires the knowledge of all scientific medicine. Therefore, solving all cases with all knowledge cannot be achieved by the knowledge of one or two people alone. It is necessary to gather the specialized knowledge of many people in order to cope with everything. The establishment of this association adheres to the above purpose, to work together and jointly promote the development of the association. The future forensic medicine is deeply relied upon," and incidentally reported that at the last standing committee meeting, the正副主任s of each group were elected, and the procedural rules were drafted. At this meeting, it is planned to discuss the procedural rules.</p>
<p>Minister's Congratulatory Speech</p>
<p>Next, a congratulatory speech was delivered by a representative of Minister Wang of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, stating in part that today is the day of the establishment of the Forensic Medicine Review Board. Medical experts from all over the country are gathered here. Because of the meeting of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, this Minister has not been able to attend the ceremony in person. I hereby express my feelings and express infinite hope, and wish the review board success. The intention of the Ministry to establish this association is to promote the development of forensic medicine and the editing of forensic medical textbooks. In terms of the former, forensic examinations of cases are to discover the truth and achieve credible verdicts, which is of the deepest help to the trial affairs. Forensic medicine in our country is not yet developed. Although a Forensic Medicine Research Institute has been established to specialize in this matter, given the size of our country and the number of criminal cases, difficult problems arise from time to time, and the discussions are inconsistent and the clues are extremely complex. It is not easy to find a proper solution without relying on the strength of the masses and the strategies of the masses. Each expert's suggestions, as well as the matters submitted by the Ministry for discussion by the Forensic Medicine Research Institute, will certainly be able to make refined contributions based on their superior academic experience, so that the sentence will be in line with the crime and the crime will be in line with the circumstances. This is one. In terms of the latter, the lack of forensic medical personnel and equipment in our country is extremely serious. The implementation of鑑定检驗s in various courts still mostly embraces the old and outdated, which is not in line with the theory. During this period of transition from the old to the new, it is urgent to create 檢驗人村. Moreover, the compilation of standard 检验 books to unify the national 檢政 and teaching materials should not be delayed. These standard teaching materials should refer to the new law and improve the existing rules, so as to be suitable for practical application. It is hoped that the training of 檢驗 personnel can be regarded as the standard. Each expert in this field will certainly be able to express their great opinions and integrate them into great achievements, so that forensic medical education will be popularized as soon as possible. This is two. The above two points are only the main points that the Ministry considers urgent. All the gentlemen are famous scholars and medical scholars, and their enthusiastic support or instructions to this association will be a hundred times more than this. This Minister, on behalf of the national forensic medical community, extends the most sincere welcome and gratitude," and the second one said that at today's inaugural meeting of the Forensic Medicine Review Board, Chief Zheng and this Chief were ordered to represent Minister Wang of the Ministry of Judicial Administration to deliver congratulatory speeches and host a banquet. In addition to the Minister's congratulatory speech, which has been delivered by Chief Zheng, this Chief further extended Minister Wang's meaning, and briefly stated one or two of the important points in which this association is related to judicial inspection, in order to extend congratulations. In the past, the inspection in our country was based solely on the "Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified," but as times have changed and science has progressed, the methods of injury and death are beyond the scope of the "Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified," and the "Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified" has become an outdated academic subject. After the founding of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Justice of Beijing once issued a book entitled "New Knowledge of Inspection," which was not detailed and was not the result of discussions among forensic medical experts from all over the country. Moreover, because it has not been unified for many years, some provinces have followed it and some have not, and it still cannot adapt to the times. This is why the Ministry of Judicial Administration first established a Forensic Medicine Research Institute, with the aim of creating forensic medical personnel who can meet the requirements of the times. Now that this association has been established, it has gathered specialist scholars together, and there is no difficulty in solving all the difficult problems in the 检验 field. In the future, the forensic doctors who conduct inspections in various courts, as well as the prosecutors who go to the site for the 相驗, and the judges who judge the cases, will be able to take the deliberations of the Muhui as the standard, so as not to be at a loss, and the parties will have nothing to use to argue, and the sentence will be free of errors and the court will be free of injustice. The judicial world should release a different color, which can be celebrated for the future of justice, and so on.</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factories Association submitted documents to the Ministries of Finance and Industry yesterday, stating: "Submitting a proposal to restrict the use of cotton yarn tax receipts to exchange for cotton cloth export duty-free transport permits, praying for approval and instructing the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Consolidated Tax Bureau to implement it, in order to prevent smuggling and protect the national cloth industry." The association's tenth joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members included a proposal by Zhou Shixuan, representative of the Qinkun Shengji Dyeing and Weaving Factory, to restrict the use of cotton yarn tax receipts to exchange for cotton cloth export duty-free transport permits due to the smuggling case in Shanghai. The association has notified relevant factories to submit their opinions and, based on the current situation, has drafted seven proposed measures to be submitted to the eleventh joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members for discussion and submission to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for adoption and implementation. Therefore, the draft of measures to restrict the exchange of cotton yarn tax receipts for cotton cloth export transport permits (details omitted) is prepared and submitted, requesting your esteemed ministries to examine and approve its implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Tea Exports Increase Sharply <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, since the National Economic Council established tea planting experiment stations in the tea-producing areas of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces two years ago, researching and improving planting and scientific processing methods, and providing practical guidance to tea farmers, urging improvements and strictly prohibiting tea merchants from adulterating inferior tea, the quality has gradually gained the trust of foreign tea merchants. This year, Anhui and Jiangxi provinces have also implemented unified control over transportation and sales, which has been convenient for foreign merchants. Therefore, since the new tea season, tea merchants from various countries such as England, France, and Russia in Shanghai have been eagerly purchasing tea. Various types of red and green tea arriving in Shanghai are in high demand, and prices are gradually rising. In recent days, the selling price of high-grade tea has exceeded 80 yuan per box, and the market situation is the best in recent years. Moreover, since January, merchant ships heading to France, England, and Russia have been loaded with large quantities of tea. The quantity transported to Russia has increased by about 30-40% compared to last year. In the past two days, 280 tons were shipped to England, and over 2,500 boxes were shipped to France. Large quantities are still stored in warehouses, waiting to be loaded onto ships. However, foreign merchants are purchasing only high-quality tea, and inferior tea is ignored. According to inspections by European tea merchants, if the work of improving Chinese tea can continue unremittingly, it will surely surpass Ceylon, India, and Java tea, and restore the inherent reputation of Chinese tea overseas.</p>

<p>When the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Huaxin" ship was loading cargo in Haizhou, the Shanghai-based Jardine Matheson sent the large tugboat "Saint Cypress" to Haizhou to rescue the "Chunhe" ship, and it was also docked in the port. The tugboat had eight steel plates damaged by the "Huaxin" ship. According to Mr. Tang Danhua, director of the China United Ship Insurance Association, the owner of the "Huaxin" ship officially reported that he arrived in Shanghai yesterday and stated that when the "Huaxin" ship was tightly docked at the Haizhou pier, the stern cable platform was excessively impacted by the turbulent currents, causing the cable platform to suddenly break. The stern lost its mooring force, and the ship was pushed outwards by the current, causing it to collide with and damage the Jardine Matheson "Saint Cypress" tugboat. This was due to the pier breaking and the turbulent currents, which could not be resisted by human force, and therefore, the ship insurance does not bear any responsibility.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Freedom vs. Control in Trade Union Membership: An Opinion <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Labor expert Mr. Chen Zhenlu expressed his views, saying that in various countries, workers' organizations initially had no freedom to form trade unions. After gaining freedom, they were initially restricted by the government, and later their own freedom devolved into laissez-faire, resulting in the inertia of freedom. As a result, the liberal organization of trade unions had to change course. After the European War, the freedom of trade union organizations fully manifested its irregularity, lack of unity, inertia and dispersion, laissez-faire and incompetence. Therefore, the former liberal organizations have mostly been replaced by controlled organizations. For example, in Soviet Russia, organizations must be within the party line; in Italy and Germany, trade union actions must be in line with the national will; and in France and the United States, importance is attached to negotiations with workers' organizations.</p>
<p>Speaking of freedom, it is initially unobjectionable, but when freedom leads to abuses, it must be remedied. As Roosevelt said, "I believe that the interpretation of freedom should be that we can provide more freedom and security to the general public than before." This is indeed a sharp rebuke to the freedom claimed by American capitalists. Paul Pic said, "The principle of freedom should be placed before the interests of society," which is the same idea. Because traditional freedom has become the freedom of a minority of capitalists, depriving the majority of those who participate in actual production of freedom. Freedom has been too much influenced by individualism, disregarding the general interests of society. This kind of freedom is like what Proudhon said, "Private property is theft" (Sa Propriete cestbvol) (Note 1). Only its drawbacks are seen, and its benefits are not seen, so it should naturally be corrected. The extreme of freedom will lead to laissez-faire, dispersion, and disorganization, like anarchy. Economic liberalism is therefore regarded as a state of anarchy in production. The extreme of freedom also fully cultivates social inertia. Individuals pursue only their own interests, ignorant of social interests, and rely on the inferior nature of isolation to live in comfort, lacking a sense of community, and willingly defying public opinion to perish. This kind of individualistic freedom is a freedom that leads to a dead end. If it is replaced by collective freedom, it is a freedom that leads to a broad path. The two should be distinguished, and the dead end should not be mistaken for the broad path.</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions submitted a request to the central government to amend Article 20 of the Trade Union Law, which states that "Trade unions shall not force workers to join or prevent them from withdrawing," and Article 21, "Trade union members may withdraw from the union at any time," to read, "All workers in the same industry or unified occupation organized by a trade union shall join the respective trade union as members," and "Trade union members shall not arbitrarily withdraw from the trade union or fail to pay membership dues without a legitimate reason approved by the union." This can be said to be transforming the trade union organization from laissez-faire to control, from freedom that is off track to freedom that is restricted on the track. In other words, it is to correct the loose inertia and incompetence of the trade union organization, making it a disciplined and mobilized group. Whether explained from the perspective of principles or from the perspective of the actual needs of extraordinary times, it can be considered an appropriate suggestion. Unfortunately, this suggestion has not yet been adopted by the central government. According to Executive Yuan Instruction No. 713, after the Ministry of Industry deliberated and replied, "Article 20, Paragraph 1 and Article 21 of the Trade Union Law are intended to prevent trade unions from hindering the freedom of workers, and there is no need for amendment." This kind of reasoning is not without room for discussion.</p>
<p>The so-called "individual freedom of workers" should be "the freedom for individual workers to obtain security," as Roosevelt said, freedom should be more freedom and security for the general public than before. It should also be as Bic said, "The principle of freedom should be respected, but this principle should be placed before the interests of society." Because the result of individual freedom has two aspects, good and evil. The good aspect is its bright side, which improves the status of workers. The evil aspect is its dark side, which makes workers' lives sink deeper into the abyss. Since the country has labor legislation, its intention is originally to protect workers. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish between the two results of individual freedom for workers. The good results can protect workers and should be retained. The evil results often isolate workers and allow them to be defeated one by one by capital groups. Each claims to be for the freedom of trade unions, but it is actually suicide for workers and should be eliminated in order to conform to the basic intent of national legislation to protect workers.</p>
<p>The era of opposing social interests based on the reason of individual freedom has passed. In the past, national legislation to protect child labor and female labor was often opposed by citing the principle of individual freedom. However, national legislation to protect child labor and female labor was eventually implemented. At the beginning of the establishment of the collective bargaining law, it was opposed by employers, and the reason was also based on the freedom of individual contracts. However, to this day, more and more workers are signing contracts with employers in the name of trade unions, and the constitutional characteristics of collective agreements are becoming more and more effective. In general, individual freedom initially has its virtue, but later it changes its nature (Note 2). Since the drawbacks have occurred, they must be corrected. Therefore, today, the value of individual freedom lies only in the good aspects of freedom, only in the aspects of freedom that are consistent with social benefits, and only in the aspects of freedom that conform to the intent of protecting the interests of labor.</p>
<p>Based on this, the "individual freedom of workers" in the legislative intent of Article 20, Paragraph 1 and Article 21 of the Trade Union Law should not fall into the stereotype of the traditional individualistic interpretation of freedom. Instead, the actual meaning of freedom should be adopted as a social, majority, and labor security interpretation. Therefore, if the amendment of Article 20, Paragraph 1 and Article 21 of the Trade Union Law can increase the centripetal force of workers towards trade unions and improve the collective interests of workers, then amending it into a more rigorous and controlled trade union organization is the beginning of implementing the legislative protection of labor and striving for progress day by day, and should not be rigidly rejected without consideration.</p>
<p>During the European War, trade unions in France, England, Germany were inspired by nationalism, helping the government to resist the enemy and mobilizing without hindrance. This is because trade unions can have the effect of using workers as if they were appendages, like using fingers. In this extraordinary period in China, the mobilization, training, and preparation of workers belonging to trade unions are extremely important. Without a rigorous organization and the role of control, it will be impossible to achieve the effect of unified will, orderly steps, and decisive command. If the mobilization order is issued but cannot be mobilized, then having an organization is like having no organization. The result of blind and disorderly actions will inevitably have an unimaginable impact on the overall situation of resisting aggression and saving the nation. This should be planned for early on. Then, changing the peacetime wording of Article 20, Paragraph 1 and Article 21 of the Trade Union Law to extraordinary period wording is even more urgently felt in reality. Now that the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions has requested the central government to reconsider, it is hoped that the administrative authorities and legislative figures will examine the past of worker organizations, pay attention to the trends and needs of the times, and discuss in detail the legislative intent of each article of the Trade Union Law, the "freedom of individual workers," and think towards its bright side, so that Chinese trade union organizations can gain greater centripetal force, transforming freedom with drawbacks into freedom without drawbacks, correcting individual laissez-faire into collective control, and progressing from relaxed inertia to a tense and capable spirit.</p>
<p>Note 1: Proudhon said: "Private property is both justice and theft" (Saproiteest unematitution de jusitce et la propricete cest levol). Therefore, private property, from one perspective, may be fair, but when its drawbacks lead to unearned gain, it evolves into the ugly drama of theft. This is another aspect of the result. Freedom is also like this. Although it may be valuable at first, as Madame Roland said, "Oh Freedom, Freedom, many crimes are committed in your name." From another perspective, the impact of its drawbacks is also unimaginable.</p>
<p>Note 2: This is actually indicated by the physical principle of "quantitative change leading to qualitative change." The moderate amount of individual freedom has inherent virtue, but the excessive amount of individual freedom has evil nature.</p>

<p>The Chinese Vegetable Oil Plant, initiated and organized by the Ministry of Industry, aims to improve the production and sales of the tung oil industry nationwide. Since the establishment of the preparatory office, inland oil merchants, aware of their own needs, have followed suit, either inquiring by letter or telegram or sending personnel to Shanghai to negotiate. For example, the representatives of the Wanxian Oil and Grain Industry and Import Industry came to Shanghai some time ago to negotiate successfully, as previously reported. Chongqing is the second largest tung oil market in Sichuan, with annual exports of about 150,000 dan. The operators are divided into oil firms and foreign firms. There are two foreign firms in the city, and the original number of oil firms was five or six. In the past year or two, oil prices have risen repeatedly, gradually increasing to twelve. Now, the oil firms are afraid that there will be too many operators, leading to unfair competition. In order to rectify the oil industry, they have initiated the organization of the Chongqing Tung Oil Firms Guild, restricting the number of firms. It has been approved by the Chongqing Municipal Government for record. Because the vegetable oil plant is about to be established, the guild has specially sent representative Yang Dianzhang to Shanghai to negotiate. Mr. Yang flew from Hankou to Shanghai on the 15th. It is reported that he will soon discuss the conditions with Mr. Zhang Jiazhu, director of the oil plant's preparatory office.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Gold Trading Declines Sharply; Handling Fees Increased <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>In view of the sharp decline in trading, the Gold Exchange, in order to maintain business, decided through a board meeting to increase the collection of handling fees from July 16. After consultation with its brokers' association, it was approved to be implemented from the 20th. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Maintaining Business by Increasing Handling Fees</p>
<p>Previously, the daily gold trading volume of the Gold Exchange was always above 100,000 units, but now it has sharply declined to only 20,000 to 30,000 units. The original handling fee was 2.5 li per unit. After deducting the 25% broker incentive, the exchange actually received 1.575 li. Now, the board of directors has decided that, in order to maintain business, the handling fee will be increased to 1 jiao per unit, including the previous fee, from July 16. Its Announcement No. 2176 states: "Now, the board of directors has decided to temporarily change the handling fee paid by brokers to the exchange to 1 jiao in national currency per unit of gold trading, excluding the 2.5 fen in national currency broker incentive. The exchange will actually receive 7.5 fen in national currency for the handling fee. It will be implemented from the 16th of this month. This announcement is made to notify all brokers, in addition to a letter to the Brokers' Association."</p>
<p>Market Guild Postpones Implementation</p>
<p>Mr. Zhan Liansheng, chairman of the Brokers' Association, convened a meeting of all brokers regarding the handling fee increase. The brokers requested a reduction and negotiated with Mr. Xu Longzhu, chairman of the Gold Exchange. Now, an agreement has been reached to follow the board's decision, but the implementation is postponed to the 20th. Announcement No. 2178 of the Market Guild states: "Now, approval is given for the request by the chairman of the Brokers' Association to change the commission and handling fees because the time is too short, and it is feared that the clients are not yet aware of it. It is proposed to postpone it for three days. After investigation, the requested matters are factual and should be postponed for three days. The changed method will be collected from the 20th of this month (Monday). This is hereby announced."</p>
<h3 id="e96">Extending the Shanghai-Wusong Branch Line; Two Railway Bureaus Send Personnel to Survey the Roadbed; Construction Will Commence After Approval by the Ministry <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the Baoshan Shanghai Fellow-Villagers Association stated that the Shanghai-Wusong branch line of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway starts from Shanghai and ends at Fort Taiwan in Wusong Town, only four li away from the county seat of Baoshan. Moreover, the route is flat, making it easy to pave the roadbed and lay the tracks. It is estimated that ten mu of land will be needed. At a price of 200 yuan per mu, it will only cost 2,000 yuan. Adding the road construction costs, station building costs, etc., the total will be no more than about 50,000 yuan. If the route is completed, transportation in Shanghai will be closer, and land prices in Baoshan will be low, which will surely attract investment in the gold industry or the construction of residences. Therefore, a special request was submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval. After reporting to the Ministry of Railways, it was considered that the statements were not without merit. Therefore, a special instruction was issued to the directors of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus, Mr. Huang Bo, to be responsible for surveying the situation and submitting it to the Ministry for approval. After receiving the order, Director Huang sent two officers from the Revenue Department to survey the area near Baoshan on the previous day and consulted with the county government on everything. After the county government secretary, Bai Mingdao, described the situation in detail, they immediately returned to Shanghai to report. It is also learned that the association, in order to urge the authorities to commence construction as soon as possible, specially dispatched director Zhao Zhengping to meet with Director Huang to present everything in person. It is now awaiting approval from the Ministry of Railways, and construction will begin soon.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Japanese Ban Fujianese from Going to Japan: No Ticket Purchases Allowed <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, Japan has been expelling Chinese sojourners from the East in numbers exceeding thousands. Scarcely a ship arrives in Shanghai without one or two expelled overseas Chinese. At the same time, restrictions on Chinese going to Japan have also been tightened. For instance, overseas compatriots doing business in Japan who wish to go to that country must first produce a certificate issued by the Japanese water police when departing Japan and returning home.</p>
<p>Permission to Land</p>
<p>Only with this certificate are they allowed to buy a ticket to board a ship. Otherwise, they are not allowed to board. Furthermore, small Chinese merchants and shop assistants (such as barbers and cooks) going to Japan must also prepay a deposit of one hundred yuan to the Japanese shipping company. If, upon arrival in Japan, the Japanese authorities do not allow the passenger to disembark and instead order them to return to China, the ship fare and other expenses will be deducted from this prepaid deposit. Such cases have been seen frequently. Recently, Japanese shipping companies in Shanghai received a telegram from Japan ordering them to</p>
<p>Ban Fujianese</p>
<p>from traveling to Japan by ship. The reason given is that Fujianese, regardless of their occupation in industry or commerce, have no fixed occupation upon arriving in Japan. Moreover, eight or nine out of ten Fujianese boarding ships in Shanghai land at Moji. This time, the ban on Fujianese going to Japan applies to all, regardless of their industry or commerce, and ship tickets are not to be sold to them. That is, they are completely prohibited from going to Moji. Fearing that some Fujianese might falsely claim to be from other provinces in order to land at other ports and enter Japanese territory, the Japanese shipping companies have added</p>
<p>Passenger Inspection</p>
<p>It is said that each Japanese ship has three inspectors who interrogate Chinese passengers traveling in third class three times during the voyage. The questions and answers are recorded in a logbook. If the answers from the three interrogations are slightly inconsistent, the passenger will not be allowed to enter the country and must be sent back to China. The strictness and precision are said to be meticulous. Local Japanese shipping companies have already complied with the telegram from Japan and are refusing to carry Fujianese passengers bound for Moji. From now on, it will be extremely difficult for Fujianese industrialists and merchants to go to the East.</p>
<h3 id="e102">French Concession Police to Auction Cigars <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The French Concession Police Department has scheduled an auction of three batches of cigars to be held at the Cigarette Investigation Team Office (i.e., the Avenue Joffre Police Station) at 235 Avenue Joffre at 4:00 PM next Thursday, the 23rd of this month. The first and second batches each consist of 10,000 cigars, and the third batch consists of 9,113 cigars. The minimum price for each batch is 25 yuan. The prices listed above are the absolute minimum, so bids from buyers must not be lower than these prices. All other tax expenses are to be borne by the buyer. Potential buyers may view the cigars at the aforementioned location every morning from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM (except Sundays).</p>

<h3 id="e104">The Local Weather is Cool; Yesterday Afternoon Saw Thunderstorms and Heavy Rain; Fewer Cases of Heatstroke and Heat Exhaustion; Gastroenteritis and Diarrhea Cases on the Rise <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Since the thunderstorms and heavy rain on the 14th, the local weather has been cloudy and cool. Yesterday morning brought another heavy rain. The streets were flooded. Here is a summary of the situation:</p>
<p>Heavy Rain Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the heavy thunderstorms of the afternoon of the 14th, the local weather has remained cloudy. The weather has been cool. From 8:00 AM yesterday, there was a light drizzle. At 11:00 AM, there were several claps of thunder, and the rain suddenly turned torrential for over an hour before gradually easing. As the drainage was insufficient, the streets were flooded. The weather remained unsettled in the evening.</p>
<p>Disease Situation</p>
<p>In the past three days, there have been fewer cases of heatstroke and heat exhaustion. However, there has been a sharp increase in cases of gastroenteritis and diarrhea. This is likely due to the fluctuating weather and careless eating and drinking habits, especially eating cold foods and oversleeping, which are major causes of illness.</p>
<p>Zhabei Flooding</p>
<p>In Zhabei, low-lying areas such as Liuying Road, Baziqiao, Tanziwan, Tianbao Road, and Shunjin Lane were flooded with four to five inches of water. The houses were submerged as if in a swamp. Due to the lack of tile drainage, the water could not recede, and pedestrians had to wade through the water late into the night, much to their discomfort.</p>
<h3 id="e105">The Baishoutang Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop Bombing: What Was the Customer's Intention in Leaving the Basket? Han Abing Seriously Injured, Others Unharmed <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Shi Deli, a native of Shaoxing, together with friends, pooled capital to open the Baishoutang Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop on Bansongyuan Road in the South City last year. The business has been operating for over a year. At around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, a customer in his fifties, dressed in a white silk long gown and resembling a merchant, approached the counter with a prescription in hand. When Han Abing, a shop assistant, saw the customer, he immediately prepared the medicine according to the prescription, packaged it, and exchanged the medicine for money. Unexpectedly, after receiving the medicine, the customer asked Han to temporarily keep a round bamboo basket he was carrying, which contained a square tin of biscuits, saying he would return shortly to pick it up. Han, seeing that he was a customer, found it difficult to refuse and readily agreed, placing the basket in a corner of the shop. The customer left and never returned. By yesterday, he had still not come to pick it up. At around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Han accidentally kicked the basket while picking up coins on the shop floor. As soon as his foot made contact, the tin of biscuits inside the basket exploded suddenly with a loud bang, shaking the roof tiles. Han's head and body were injured severely. Nearby police officers rushed to the scene upon hearing the explosion and immediately reported it to the West Gate Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. They also rushed the injured Han Abing to Shanghai Hospital. His injuries are said to be severe and life-threatening. According to people in the shop, luckily, only Han was inside at the time of the explosion; otherwise, more people would have been injured. The Public Security Bureau is currently conducting a thorough investigation into the details of the case.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Execution of Opium Smoking Case: Gu Zhuxuan Imprisoned; Court Summoned Gu Yesterday for Investigation in Dai Dongpo Case; Gu Arrived in Court in Prisoner's Short Shirt to Testify <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, former head of the Chan Theater and president of the Jianghuai Association of fellow townsmen from Yancheng, and Wang Xinggao, formerly serving in the military and police, both natives of Ningbo, were arrested for allegedly inciting the assassination of Tang Jiapeng. The Special Court sentenced them to fifteen years and life imprisonment, respectively. Upon appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court, the results of the trial showed a lack of sufficient evidence of the crime, and both were acquitted. Wang Xinggao was released on bail with a written guarantee of 10,000 yuan during the appeal period. The Police Affairs Department, dissatisfied with the appeal verdict, has filed an appeal to the Supreme Court. Gu Zhuxuan was sentenced to eight months in prison for bribing guards outside the Guangci Hospital prison to smoke opium. The Third Branch of the High Court upheld the original sentence and deprived him of his civil rights for one year. Now that the sentence in the smoking case has been finalized, the Criminal Execution Court of the Third Branch of the High Court ordered that Gu Zhuxuan be sent to the Second Special District Prison to serve his sentence the day before yesterday. Separately, Dai Dongpo, a Jiangbei bandit, was in the process of appealing his crime in the Jiangsu High Court in Suzhou. Coincidentally, during the January 28th Incident, he was in a refugee shelter established by Gu Zhuxuan's Jianghuai Association. Therefore, the Suzhou High Court entrusted the Third Branch of the High Court to inquire with Gu Zhuxuan about whether there was such a person as Dai Dongpo after hearing Gu Zhuxuan's appeal case on the 20th of last month, The magistrate Wang Yue asked Gu to find out if such a person existed and Gu confessed that he needed to investigate the Jianghuai Association. Gu, on instruction from the court, entrusted his brother Songmao to investigate the matter at the association and report back. Now, the Suzhou High Court has again entrusted the Third Branch of the High Court to inquire. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Magistrate Wang Yue of the Third Criminal Court came to the Third Criminal Court and ordered Gu Zhuxuan to be brought to court. Gu, wearing a gray cloth prisoner's short shirt numbered 43 on his upper body and white silk trousers on his lower body, stood before the case. The official stated that he was questioning him about Dai Dongpo. Gu stated that at that time, the shelter took in many refugees, and he could not remember the names of the refugees at that time. He suggested that a letter could be sent to the office staff of the Jianghuai Association to investigate the roster, which would clarify the matter. The address of the association is now at the end of Zhongshan Road and Gonghe Xin Road in Zhabei. After verifying the confession, the court ordered the bailiff to escort Gu back to prison to serve his sentence and learned that the Third Branch of the High Court was scheduled to summon Wang Xinggao to court this morning to question him about a certain matter.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Throwing Away Elderly Mother, Wife, and Children: Tragedy in the Huangpu River <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>At 4:00 PM yesterday, a middle-aged male passenger suddenly jumped into the Huangpu River from the stern of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Shanghai-Ningbo route Xin Jiangtian steamship. His body struggled two or three times, but it was too late to save him, and he sank without a trace. The passenger was traveling with his elderly mother, wife, and one son and one daughter back home. Upon seeing this, his mother and wife were inconsolable. The French Concession Xiaodongmen Police Station took the four family members, young and old, back to the police station and notified the Customs Water Police, who sent Detective Zhou Zenghua to retrieve them. According to the deceased's wife, her husband's name was Chen Chenglong, 32 years old, from Yuyao. He had been working as a bookkeeper at the Zu'an Sock Factory on Dongyouheng Road in Hongkou. He suddenly developed a mental illness two months ago, and his speech and behavior were erratic, and he would cry uncontrollably. The illness would come and go. Today, the whole family, old and young, was traveling to Ningbo to seek medical treatment at home when he unexpectedly had an attack and committed suicide. The police chief, noting that the wife had nearly jumped into the river to seek death when she was brought back and was only stopped by the arresting officer, feared that she might repeat the attempt. Therefore, he waited for instructions to summon someone from the Zu'an Sock Factory to comfort her.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Puji Sanatorium Water Tower to Supply Drinking Water to the County <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Since taking office, Ye Zhendong, the magistrate of Shanghai County, has been aware that the county relies on natural water for drinking water, which is unhygienic. Therefore, he recently contacted Lu Bohong, the director of the Puji Sanatorium, to connect the sanatorium's water tower to the county government. The water tower can supply drinking water to 8,000 people, while the sanatorium currently only supplies 1,000 people. Mr. Lu agreed, and the application to the provincial government has been approved. Preparations have begun to purchase two kilometers of water pipes, costing 8,000 yuan, with the sanatorium and county government each bearing half the cost. The county government will use 7,500 gallons per month, paying a water fee of 60 yuan per month. The sanatorium will handle sales to the public. The water supply project is expected to be completed within this month.</p>
<h3 id="e109">New Invention: Double-Use Security Door Lock; The Engineering Research Institute of the Academia Sinica Certifies Its Excellent Construction <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The inclined column gate-type double-use security door lock, patented by the Ministry of Industry for five years, has been adopted by the Jiangwan Applied Science Society, which has produced six types of Arrow brand and unnamed brand door locks based on this principle, priced from 1.95 yuan to 10 yuan. The effectiveness and advantages of each lock vary. In particular, the bathroom lock, where the door handle automatically changes color depending on whether the door is open or closed, and the 1.95 yuan unnamed brand tumbler double-use door lock are the most ingenious and unique. These door locks have also been tested by the Academia Sinica, which has certified that the lock doors are within the NX range and that the tooth shapes of the keys are different for each lock, with the same effectiveness as the popular foreign "Yale" and "Corbin" locks on the market. Furthermore, it has been proven that the entire structure has three major advantages: A. The simple construction reduces costs, resulting in a low selling price; B. All parts are uniformly strong, ensuring durability and preventing sudden damage; C. Prevention of water ingress and rust, taking considerable care in this regard. The locks are currently sold by Fengyuan Trading Company at 356 Beijing Road, as well as by Yong'an Company, Sincere Company, and major hardware stores.</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Telephone Company Will Issue Another Notice to Subscribers Regarding the Reporting of Bills and Documents; This Concerns Your Vital Interests, Please Do Not Abandon Them <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Telephone Problem Committee of the Shanghai Special District, in preparation for negotiations with the Municipal Council to request that the council, based on the terms of the franchise agreement, convene a board meeting to re-discuss reducing telephone rates if the income of the Shanghai Telephone Company exceeds 10%, has issued a notice to all telephone subscribers in the city to promptly report their recent new fee bills to the committee. It has been more than three months since the committee requested subscribers to report their bills, and the number of bills reported by subscribers has been small, making it difficult to conduct a comprehensive audit. Yesterday, another notice was issued, urging them to promptly report the bills for verification. The notice is recorded as follows: Regarding the issue of negotiating the increase in telephone rates in the Special District, the Chinese Ratepayers' Meeting of the Public Concession resolved (1) to collect all relevant evidence, (2) to ensure that the profit does not exceed 10%, and (3) to calculate profits based on actual equipment. A letter was sent to the committee to collect new bills from subscribers and forward them for auditing so that a proposal could be submitted to the Municipal Council for rediscussing and lowering telephone rates. The committee issued a notice and sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to instruct all businesses to comply. However, since more than three months have passed, the number of reports received by the committee has been small, making it difficult to conduct a comprehensive audit and proceed with negotiations. Therefore, another notice is hereby issued, urging all telephone subscribers in the city to promptly submit all new bills and evidence of floating calculation figures to the committee (Shanghai Special District Telephone Problem Committee, located within the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce at Tianhougong Bridge) within the latest time limit so that they can be forwarded to the Chinese Ratepayers' Meeting for protest. This matter concerns the interests of all Chinese and is a struggle to control the benefits of public utilities. Please comply with the reporting requirements and do not delay.</p>

<p>The Yongtaihe Tobacco Company of this port, on the evening of the 27th of last month at 7:00 PM, hired barge number 20702 belonging to a Ningbo man named Wang Ahu, to unload various brands of cigarettes produced by the Yizhong Tobacco Company, including Little Fairy, Red Seal, Golden, Pinhai, Old Knife, Red Tin Package, and the Huacheng Tobacco Company's Golden Rat and Maoling brands, totaling thirty-nine boxes, from the company's warehouse on the south bank of the Zhabei Road Bridge in Suzhou Creek. These were to be transported to various sales locations of Wusong Zhang Yuanmao, Xiang Dalong, Lao Tongsheng, Tonghexing, and Yongtaihe distribution points. The barge arrived at</p>
<p>Qiujiang Wharf near the river surface, close to midnight. Suddenly, a wharf boat loaded with bandits approached and docked alongside Wang's boat. Ten bandits jumped out, brandishing handguns, and threatened and bound the master and crew members with ropes, locking them inside the cabin. They then proceeded to move the cigarette boxes onto the bandit boat, stealing a total of thirty-seven boxes, worth 6,060 yuan. Remaining were one box each of Little Fairy and Old Knife brands. The bandit boat then sailed away. Yongtaihe Company immediately reported the incident and dispatched personnel to request the assistance of the Customs Water Police in pursuit, and also</p>
<p>placed a notice in the newspaper offering a reward of 500 yuan, hoping for public cooperation in apprehending the criminals. On the 7th of this month, the Water Police learned that the cigarette robbers were crew members from several of Yizhong Tobacco Company's cigarette transport ships, all of whom had fled and disappeared. On the evening of the 12th, they received a tip-off about the bandits' whereabouts and, on the morning of the 13th, dispatched detectives, together with officers from the Pudong Branch Bureau, to apprehend three cigarette robbers from Chongming, Sheng Dalang, Shi Yinlang, and Gu Erlang, in a shed behind the Labor Village near the Branch Bureau. There was also a fugitive from Zhenjiang next door, Wang Jinsheng,</p>
<p>who had fled upon hearing the news, with only his wife, Wang Zhangshi from Yangzhou, being captured. The four suspects, both men and women, were taken to the Branch Bureau for interrogation and detention. On the morning of the 14th, they were transferred to the Water Police, where they confessed that the stolen goods had been transported to Zhou Pei and Zhang Cailin, because Zhang's family ran a general association, making it easier to sell the goods. Upon hearing this confession, the detective head immediately dispatched five experienced detectives, Cheng Yongnian, Shen Changshan, Hu Changqing, Qu HeKui, Gu Wenkui, etc., at 1:00 PM, along with one of the Sheng suspects, to</p>
<p>Zhoupu Town in Pudong, to cooperate with the police from the First Resident Police Station of the County Public Security Bureau in arresting Zhang. According to Zhang's confession, after the stolen goods arrived in Pudong, they were transported by Shen Jialu, Wu Jiasheng, and Wang Baoming, all from Beicai. The detectives then escorted Zhang to number 62, section seven of Beicai Town, and apprehended Shen Jialu and Wu Jiasheng. They were taken back to the police station, where Wu Jiasheng confessed that he was the Deputy Commander of the Xiukang Township Defense Corps in Nanhui County. According to both suspects, the stolen goods were initially transported to the NanChang Paper Shop near the Huanlong Bridge in Datuan Town,</p>
<p>but after failing to sell them, they were returned and transported by Wu to the home of Pan Xukui, the Township Head of the Sixth Bao of Xiukang Township. As a result, the case became increasingly complicated. The original detectives then cooperated with the Head of the Zhoupu Defense Corps, accompanied by four members of the corps and two officers from the First Resident Police Station, to escort Wu overnight to Pan Yongzhai's house in Qiujiage, Xiukang Township, the home of Township Head Pan Xukui, for a search. As they approached Pan's residence, it was already midnight.</p>
<p>They heard the sound of gongs being beaten loudly, followed by a dense barrage of gunshots. The detectives, unaware of the true situation, huddled in the fields to observe the situation. After a while, when the gunshots subsided, they learned that a Cai family residence in the area had been robbed. The villagers had sounded the gongs to gather a crowd to pursue the robbers, who resisted by firing guns as they fled. Once the detectives' panic subsided, they continued forward and arrived at Pan Xukui's residence, which turned out to be a huge complex of more than twenty interconnected rooms. The doors and windows of each room were open, and there were</p>
<p>several tables of food and drink still warm in the reception hall, but there was no one to be found. The detectives then entered the house with their guns and searched the premises. They soon discovered an empty room in the rear, with numerous box marks on the floor and a piece of crate recovered, bearing the name of the Yizhong Tobacco Company. The detectives tracked the trail to the rear bank and observed that the duckweed in the bank was disturbed, as if a large object had been thrown into it. At this point, it was clear that the Pan family had fled with the stolen goods upon hearing the news. They then discovered a sack of cigarettes hidden in a</p>
<p>field near the house, containing eight boxes of Pinhai brand cigarettes in packs of fifty, four boxes of Red Seal brand, one box of Old Knife brand, eighteen pieces of crate wood, and the words "Pan Xukui" painted on the outside of the bag. In addition, there were five carrying poles, indicating that the stolen goods had been transported away. On the 15th (the day before yesterday), after dawn, the Water Police received a report and dispatched additional detectives, Zhou Zenghua and Xu Lenian,</p>
<p>to assist. At around 8:00 AM, a villager reported to the Zhoupu First Resident Police Station that a large quantity of cigarettes was hidden in a graveyard about 150 yards east of Township Head Pan Xukui's residence. Because the surrounding area was surrounded by dense trees, it was difficult for outsiders to notice. The detectives rushed to the location and uncovered one box of 36 packs of Maoling brand, one box of 185 boxes of Golden Rat brand, one box of</p>
<p>76 boxes of Old Knife brand, one box of 28 boxes of Pinhai brand, one box of 53 boxes of Golden brand with 300 packs, nine boxes of 176 boxes of Red Seal brand with 73 packs, and six boxes of 96 boxes of Little Fairy brand with 470 packs, totaling 27 boxes. All of the boxes were extremely damp. It appeared that the remaining ten boxes had already been sold. The stolen goods were transported back to the police station for temporary storage. The detectives then searched again all night the night before last, until yesterday morning,</p>
<p>when the entire team of detectives brought the Sheng Dalang suspect back to Shanghai. Zhang Cailin, Shen Jialu, and Wu Jiasheng, the three suspects apprehended in Nanhui County, were escorted by the police station to the County Public Security Bureau for disposition yesterday. The Water Police then notified Yongtaihe Company to join them in Nanyi today to transfer the three suspects and the stolen goods for investigation and prosecution. The police also learned from the confessions of Sheng Dalang and other suspects that</p>
<p>the idea of the cigarette robbery had been in the works for a long time. The first attempt was about three weeks ago, when they secretly used boat owner Yang Maotou's wharf boat number 5728 to intercept the original cigarette transport ship, but they were unsuccessful. The second time, they used Yang Maotou's wharf boat number 5272 to wait at Qiujiang Wharf and successfully rob the cigarettes. They sailed the boat to Qichang Warehouse in Pudong and hired a new Fei tugboat to tow it to the Bailianjing port, where they sailed into Zhoupu, etc. Yesterday, the police also impounded the two boats mentioned and are awaiting instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Private Opening of Letters Results in Fine <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Lu Zhongwen, Ye Liang, and Chen Zhengzhou from Guangdong, the inventors of the three-purpose light bulb, entered into a contract to establish the Central Three-Purpose Light Bulb Factory at 221 Sapo Sai Road in the French Concession, with Ye as the factory manager, Chen as the general manager, and Lu as the deputy. Last month, Lu, Ye, and others discovered that Chen had falsified the accounting books, leading to a dispute. Accountant Wang Zikang was appointed as a mediator. On the 4th of this month, during negotiations at Wang Zikang's home, Chen discovered that Lu had secretly opened and read letters sent to him from Hong Kong, leading to an argument. Chen reported this to the Public Concession Police, who detained Lu and notified the French Police. Detective Jin Bingwen brought Lu back and sent him to the Special Second Court. The French Police Department filed a public prosecution against him for both obstructing privacy and theft. The defendant, Lu Zhongwen, argued that the plaintiff, Chen Weizhou, had established the Central Three-Purpose Light Bulb Factory in Hong Kong without his consent, infringing upon the inventor's interests and constituting a breach of trust, so he took the letters as evidence. After investigation and trial by Judge Qiu Huan of the Special Second Court, a date was set for sentencing. Lu was ordered to provide bail and be available for summons. Yesterday was the date of sentencing. At 8:00 AM, Judge Qiu delivered a judgment in the Eighth Criminal Chamber, finding Lu Zhongwen guilty of opening and concealing another person's sealed letter without reason, and sentenced him to a fine of twenty yuan. If he failed to pay, he would be required to perform labor service, with one yuan equivalent to one day. He was found not guilty on the other charges. Upon hearing the verdict, Lu expressed his dissatisfaction in court. The court ruled that the defendant must remain on bail pending the appeal period. It was also heard that Lu Zhongwen had filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court accusing Chen of forging documents and breach of trust, and a hearing would be held soon.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Foreign Automobiles Coming to Shanghai Can Obtain Temporary Concession Permits - Must Be Applied for Through the China Automobile Association - <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The China Automobile Association, after lengthy negotiations, has obtained permission from the Shanghai Public Concession and French Concession authorities to issue temporary permits to foreign automobiles for short stays in Shanghai. The fees for these permits have been set at two yuan in national currency for the first three days, with an additional one yuan for each subsequent three days (or less). The total stay in Shanghai cannot exceed thirty days. In addition, there is a one-yuan fee for a driver's license. Since the implementation of this new temporary permit system, it has been well-received by various sectors. Foreign automobiles can now easily come to Shanghai and drive around for a short stay without having to obtain a six-month automobile permit. However, these temporary permits must be applied for through the China Automobile Association. If they can be obtained, they are the right of the members, because all foreign automobiles staying in Shanghai are guaranteed by the association with cash deposits that they will return to their original place of registration on time and that all automobiles will pay the fees as required. This method was originally initiated by the association, which aims to develop the Chinese automobile industry and makes every effort to contribute to society in any way that benefits the public. It is believed that the two concession authorities welcome and support Chinese and foreign automobiles coming to Shanghai for sightseeing, as China has now opened its doors wide to automobile travel. The association hopes that the Chinese government authorities will recognize the permits issued by the governments of various friendly nations for automobiles, so that automobiles from all countries can freely come to China for travel and sightseeing, just as the concession authorities allow Chinese mainland automobiles to travel in the Shanghai concessions, providing convenience in order to promote China's tourism industry. The association has recently submitted a request to the Chinese government authorities to achieve this goal.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Western Body Found on Avenue Dubail: Murder or Suicide Yet to Be Determined <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that this morning (the 16th), a young man's body was found on Avenue Dubail, not far west of Avenue Haig. The man had been shot in the head. It was later learned that the deceased was an American, Mr. Covert. There was no weapon found near his body, so investigators today believe the man was murdered, not that he committed suicide. However, it is also possible that it was suicide. Around 3:00 AM this morning, a sentry at the Lancashire Barracks on Thibet Road heard a gunshot nearby, but could not see anything in the dark. Then, around 4:15 AM, a rickshaw traveling along Avenue Dubail found a man lying on the sidewalk north of the road, about 960 yards west of Avenue Haig. The rickshaw driver reported the incident to the Chinese police at number 276 nearby, who then notified the Avenue Haig police station by telephone. An ambulance arrived and took the man to a nearby rural hospital. Mr. Covert was not yet dead at that time. Doctors confirmed that he had been shot in the head and provided treatment, but he died of his injuries at 9:26 AM. At the same time, the Avenue Haig police station began a thorough investigation. Based on the condition of the injuries prior to death, the deceased had been lying on the ground for at least an hour before being discovered, so he had been shot at least an hour earlier. Police searched the dead man's pockets and found his passport, which revealed his name and that he was 36 years old. There were seven copper coins in his pocket. At 6:30 AM, they reported the incident to the American authorities, who ordered the body to be transferred to the International Funeral Parlor on Kiaochow Road for a preliminary examination. It was found that the bullet had entered near the right temple and exited the back of the head. The deceased was from the state of Utah in the United States. It is heard that he came from a famous family and married in Honolulu. The couple arrived in Shanghai about a year ago, but have not found employment. Not long ago, he went to Yantai once. When they first arrived in China, they had a large sum of money, but it has now been mostly spent. The couple has been living at 150 Thibet Road. This morning, his wife said that her husband returned home around 2:00 AM last night, and she and him went to visit a friend at 52 Avenue Dubail, but did not enter the house. Her husband gave her about 100 yuan and left, and that was the last time she saw him. She also said that her husband had a handgun that he had been trying to sell recently, but he had not found a buyer. She does not know the caliber of the gun, and the gun is now missing.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall has always been committed to promoting domestic products and expanding sales channels. It has been in operation for fifteen years. The previous director of the hall, Mr. Zhu Wenqi, has completed his two-year term, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has appointed Mr. Xu Xiaochu to succeed him. The colleagues of the hall believe that Mr. Xu is the manager of the Sino-French Pharmacy and the chairman of the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, and that he has always spared no effort in promoting domestic goods and serving the community with great enthusiasm. This time, at the beginning of his new appointment, he gave many instructions. Therefore, yesterday (the 14th) at 6:00 PM, a public banquet was held at the Jinlong Hotel. The previous director, Mr. Zhu Wenqi, also attended. First, General Manager Zhu Boyuan delivered a welcome speech on behalf of all the colleagues, saying that the hall has been established for fifteen years, and under the leadership of Director Zhu in the previous term, the internal and external work has been carried out successfully. Mr. Xu is also a veteran in the domestic goods sector. This time, he is taking over as the new director of the hall and will continue to lead us. I hope that Mr. Xu will give us more guidance, and I also hope that Mr. Zhu will give us advice from time to time to correct our shortcomings. Then, Director Zhu gave a speech, saying that he was very grateful for the assistance of all the colleagues during his two years as director of the exhibition hall. All of the colleagues are young and talented, and have rich work experience. After Mr. Xu takes over the new position, I still hope that everyone will adhere to their original intentions and continue to be enthusiastic to the end. Finally, Mr. Xu gave a training speech, earnestly encouraging everyone to work hard in the three major areas of exhibition, promotion, and cleanliness. The words were very sincere. The banquet ended happily with a group photo at 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Qingliang Temple Eviction Case: Qinghai Sues Sheng Yuyou, Alleging Perjury Before the Judicial Authorities; Defendant Has Gone to Study in England and Cannot Respond to the Lawsuit <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The abbot of Qingliang Chan Temple at 15 Xinchang Road, Qinghai, is seventy-three years old. Last year, he was sued by the British merchant Tonghe Yangxing, represented by a lawyer, in the Civil Division of the First Special Court, requesting eviction. The reason given was that the original site of Qingliang Temple at 15 Xinchang Road was the property of the late Qing Gongbao Sheng Xuanhuai's wife, Zhuang Laotaitai, and was leased by Qinghai for a term of five years. If Qingliang Temple added buildings or other structures on the vacant land, they should be</p>
<p>completely demolished after the expiration of the term. Later, in 1928, the Sheng family borrowed 150,000 taels of silver from Tonghe Yangxing and mortgaged the houses and vacant land at that location, transferring the property deed and all property rights. Later, Tonghe Yangxing, considering that the houses were old and in need of repair, planned to rebuild them, and therefore notified the Qinghai monk in writing in September 1934, giving him a deadline to move out. Because they could not get what they wanted, they filed a lawsuit. As a result, the first instance judgment ordered Qinghai to move out of the houses located at 15 and 16 Xinchang Road and</p>
<p>return them to the plaintiff. This case was not allowed to be provisionally enforced. Later, the defendant appealed the judgment, and the third and final instance has concluded, with Qinghai losing the case and now in the process of enforcement. Now, Qinghai alleges that Sheng Yuyou, the descendant of Sheng Zhuang, committed perjury before the judicial authorities, so he has hired two lawyers, Lu Qi and Yuan Xilian, to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the First Special Court, stating that when Tonghe Yangxing sued Qinghai for eviction, the defendant in this case, Sheng Yuyou, was clearly the landlord and one of the parties who signed</p>
<p>the lease in question, yet he did not file a lawsuit himself in accordance with the law, but colluded with Tonghe Yangxing, the manager, to file a lawsuit with the court and gave false testimony twice in court. For example, on the afternoon of January 29, 1935, in the Thirteenth Court, he testified that the land in question was initially mortgaged to Tonghe Yangxing for 150,000 taels of silver in 1928 and later increased to 350,000 yuan, and that the land in question was about twenty mu, including the house, and that the property title was also handed over to</p>
<p>Tonghe Yangxing. However, according to Tonghe Yangxing's complaint, the initial mortgage was 200,000 taels and now it has been increased to 350,000 yuan, and the land in question is twenty mu, three fen, four li, and five hao, and Tonghe Yangxing only has the mortgage right, not the ownership right. Because of Sheng Yuyou's false statements, the plaintiff in the original case lost the lawsuit, which constitutes the crime of perjury under Article 168 of the Criminal Law, etc. This case was heard by Judge Tan Xinzhen in the Eighth Criminal Chamber at 11:30 yesterday morning. The defendant, Sheng Yuyou, hired Xu Shihao and Zuo Detao as lawyers, who stated in court that Sheng Yuyou had gone to</p>
<p>England to study last August, and all the documents from the previous case have been forwarded by the Chinese Ambassador to England, so it is impossible for him to appear in court. Moreover, this case has already concluded in the third instance and is now in the stage of enforcement, and the plaintiff is aware that the defendant is far away overseas, but intentionally filed a lawsuit to confuse the court and presented the judgment. The plaintiff's lawyer, Lu Qi, said that although this case has already concluded in the third instance, Qinghai is still filing a lawsuit for execution objection and confirmation that the contract is invalid, etc. Judge Tan said that he needed to review the files from the previous case to investigate whether the defendant had gone abroad, and then ordered a change of date for further verification.</p>

<p>The Gongxin Accounting Firm was founded in February 1934 by Accountant Xi Yushu, assisted by Accountants Chen Chaolun and Cao Yu. The firm's name, Gongxin (public trust), was chosen because the accounting business places the utmost importance on creditworthiness and should be trusted by the public. However, in the initial stage of its establishment, all external matters were still conducted under the name of Accountant Xi personally. Now, Shen Weijing, Chen Zongshun, Zhu Xinmin, Zhang Genglin, Li Haopei, Yao Fuyuan, and other accountants and lawyers have joined the firm successively. It was originally planned to move into the Zhongshi Building on July 1, but for the convenience of registering creditors, the firm has expanded at its original address in the Jinxing Building at 509 Nanhe Road. In terms of internal organization, Accountant Xi will serve as the chief accountant, with Cao Yu as the director of general affairs, Gong Maode as the deputy director, Shen Weijing as the director of audit, Chen Chaolun as the deputy director, Chen Zongshun as the director of schools and editing, Zhu Xinmin as the deputy director, Li Haopei as the director of the legal department, and Yao Fuyuan and Zhang Genglin as lawyers and accountants. In the future, all external matters will be conducted under the name of the Gongxin Accounting Firm. Accountant Xi has been practicing in Shanghai for ten years, and he has always been serious and highly reputable in handling cases. Now, with the assistance of many scholars, its business prospects will definitely be even more promising.</p>

<p>The Shen Times News Agency reports from this port that recently, newspapers reported that the Executive Yuan had issued an order to stop the issuance of Yellow River flood relief charity lottery tickets. At the same time, the Yellow River Flood Relief Lottery Office published a notice stating that they would continue to issue the tickets, which had been filed with the Executive Yuan by the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. A reporter from the Shen Times News Agency interviewed the Ministry of Finance and other related parties to clarify the truth and learned that the Executive Yuan had previously approved the issuance of the tickets up to the twelfth issue. When the thirteenth issue was continued, the Hebei-Chahar Political Council did submit a request to the Executive Yuan for filing. The Executive Yuan forwarded it to the Ministry of Finance for review. The Ministry of Finance replied that the issuance of the lottery tickets had been approved previously as a temporary measure and should not be continued. The Executive Yuan then issued an order to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council to stop the continued issuance of the tickets as discussed. The Yellow River Flood Relief Lottery Office said that it had filed with the Executive Yuan, but in fact, although it had submitted a request, it had not been approved. Currently, the tickets are still being sold in Hunan, Hubei, Shanghai, and other places. The governments of various provinces and cities have successively sent telegrams to the Ministry of Finance asking whether to ban them and requesting a reply. The Ministry of Finance replied that the tickets had not been approved for continued issuance by the Executive Yuan and issued separate telegrams to ban them in accordance with the law. This is the origin of the statement that the issuance has been stopped.</p>

<p>Since last year, the Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association has successively established agricultural busy season daycare centers in Xiling, Xingang, and other places, assigning female teachers to be in charge of all matters, including training, education, and care. This has reduced the mental burden on farming families and provided educational convenience for children. With the help and assistance of the Gaoqiao Health Office and local people, the project has made further progress. Therefore, public opinion is in favor and the results are remarkable. This summer, in addition to the two existing centers, two more centers have been established in Gaoxing and Gaoqiao. Mr. Wang KuiSheng, the director of the association, also consulted with the China Children's Welfare Association, which agreed to provide a subsidy of 600 yuan for start-up costs for the establishment of the Gaoqiao daycare center and to supplement other centers. Children aged two to six can register to join. Admission and departure from the center are based on certificates with photos attached to ensure formality. The Gaoqiao Town Daycare Center is located in the park, which has a beautiful environment. Shuttle buses are used every day to pick up and drop off children in the morning and evening, and the facilities for naps, showers, games, etc. are also very complete. At present, the number of people in each center is quite developed. This project is still new in the Gaoqiao area, and future progress depends on the continued efforts of local organizations and enthusiastic people.</p>
<h3 id="e123">A New Scam in Shanghai Involving the Sale of Shotguns and Radios: Forged Seals Used to Collect Letters, Claiming Letters Not Received; When Police Investigated and Went to Make Arrests, the Company Had Moved Away; Zhang Wenwei, Who Was Visiting to Investigate Ways to Make Money, Detained by Detectives <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Wenwei, Wang Xu, Wang Xihua, etc., from Danyang, opened a Central Company inside Dahua Bookstore and Haoyundao Bookstore at 40 Jiaotong Road, specializing in the sale of shotguns, radios, etc., at particularly low prices. Those from other places who needed to purchase the above items only had to mail the money to the company, and the goods would be delivered immediately. Because of the low prices, the business was quite developed, and many people from other places sent money to purchase the items. Recently, it was discovered that the seals on many registered letters sent to the company were forged. The Central Company also contacted the post office to ask why so many letters had not been received. The post office investigated Huang Guozhen, the postman who delivered the letters to the company, number 450. According to Huang, all the letters were indeed delivered to the company, and the company personnel signed for them and provided the seals. He did not know whether the seals were genuine or not. The post office then sent an employee, Zhang Guangshu, and others to investigate, but no evidence was found. The case was reported to the Hongkou Police, and Chief Detective Xi dispatched Chinese detectives Huang Fusen and Lie Zhaonian to investigate. For several days in a row, there was no news. The day before yesterday morning, Detective Huang, disguised as a student, went to 40 Jiaotong Road. When pretending to buy books, he happened to hear two apprentices from the Central Company talking. They instructed each other that if postal or police personnel came to investigate, they must firmly claim that the letters had not been received and that no other information could be revealed. Detective Huang thought that the words of the apprentices were very suspicious, and that it was obviously a scam. He reported this to Chief Detective Xi and obtained a search warrant from the Special Court. In the afternoon, he went to the Central Company to search, but the company had moved away, and none of the responsible personnel could be found. The case was finally revealed, indicating that the company had forged its own seals to collect the mail. When customers questioned, they would answer that they had not received the money, in order to achieve their fraudulent financial goals. After strict investigation, it was learned that Zhang Wenwei lived at 2 Fangxie Road. An arrest was made, but he was not found. It was also found that all of the company's assets had been moved to the Renxing Postal Transport Company at 32 Chungen Lane, Edo Road, and were impounded. Unexpectedly, Zhang Wenwei went to Jiaotong Road in the afternoon to investigate the situation. He was spotted by the detectives on guard and arrested. Zhang denied the incident, saying that he needed to find Wang Xu (also known as Tongsheng) and Wang Xihua before he could know the truth. The detectives then went to 96 Anlan Road with the police detectives from the Public Security Bureau to arrest Wang and Wang, but they were not found. Yesterday morning, Zhang was sent to the Fifth Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the previous situation. Because the police still needed to investigate and arrest the remaining suspects, he requested permission for detention. Judge Fu Lin questioned Zhang Wenwei and ordered that he be detained and interrogated again in a week.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Arrest of a Chinese School Tea Boy on Suspicion of Robbery: Water Police Detectives Allege His Involvement in the Robbery, But Whether He Was at School at the Time Requires Further Investigation <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>On the 6th of last month, Shanlian Town, Wuxing County, was raided by a large gang of Anhui-籍 pirates, with losses amounting to over 40,000 yuan. At the same time, dozens of rifles were stolen from the security team. Subsequently, the Water Police Corps seized two ships in Jiaxing and other locations, apprehending several bandits and confiscating more than ten firearms. The fifth squad of the first brigade of the Water Police Corps also cooperated with Chinese Detective Feng Zhiming of the Shanghai Public Concession Police to capture three bandits in Shanghai, who have already been taken back. Now, Wang Qirong, a detective from the fourth team of the Water Police, also an Anhui native, happened to be in Shanlian Town when the bandits raided it, and many of the bandits were known to him. Among them, there was a bandit from Anhui named Wu Changhou (also known as Changnian), who he knew was working as a tea boy at the Shanghai Chinese Public School. He then accompanied a Zhu-姓 police officer to Shanghai. Because they did not know the location of the Chinese Public School or Wu's whereabouts, they took a trolley bus at 1 PM the day before yesterday, intending to visit Xiaoshadu Road to inquire. Unexpectedly, when the bus passed Avenue Road, they saw Wu walking on the road. They immediately got off the bus and, with the assistance of Chinese Constable No. 2942, arrested Wu and took him to the Chengdu Road Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the eighth criminal court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police station, requested permission to detain Wu temporarily, stating that the defendant had been working as a tea boy at the Shanghai Chinese Public School of the Public Works Department on Jingzhou Road for many years. According to Wu, he did indeed take a month's leave between April 27th or 28th and May 29th, but he returned to school on May 29th, meaning he was at school on June 6th. The period of leave is the key to this case, and the police station still needs to investigate, and so on. When questioned, Wu Changhou denied the allegations. Judge Tan Xinzhen reviewed the confession and ordered him to be detained for further questioning at a later date.</p>

<p>Liu Miao-氏, a 33-year-old woman from Yangzhou residing at No. 6, Xinglongfang, Lane 101, Chongqing Road, was found the day before yesterday with her hands and feet discolored and her condition critical. Her husband, Liu Dianlong, was informed, and he accompanied her to Renji Hospital. After examination by the hospital's doctor, it was determined that she had ingested opium, and an enema was administered, but to no avail. She soon died. The hospital reported the matter to the Chengdu Road Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. The body was then taken to the Philander Road Morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, Zhang Zongru, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, etc., arrived at the morgue to examine the body. Head Constable Jiang Linxiang reported the previous circumstances, and Liu Dianlong, the deceased's husband, stated that he was 33 years old, from Yangzhou, and had been a detective in the French Concession Police for two months, but now worked at a dance hall in the Albert Garden. At 5 AM yesterday morning, I finished work and returned home, where I saw my wife lying on the floor smoking opium. At 1 PM, the maid told me that my wife had suddenly fallen ill. When I went to see her, I noticed stains on her trousers. I then called Dr. Chen Jiuzhou of Chinese Medicine for treatment. He prescribed medicine. Later in the evening after I arrived to the dance hall, my family rushed to me, reporting that my wife's fever had worsened. I rushed back and saw that her hands, feet, and other parts of her body were purple. I then sent her to Renji Hospital. That hospital immediately recognized it as a drug overdose. Without even taking her pulse, they performed an enema. As a result, she died within fifteen minutes of arriving at the hospital. I know that those who treated her were not doctors, and my wife and I were very fond of each other. There was no reason for her to take her life through suicide. Therefore, I suspect if she indeed died from a drug overdose or she died from illness, I have doubts, so I ask for a detailed examination to determine the cause of death. After hearing the statement, Zhang-君 said, "If you have any doubts, then the body must be dissected for examination before a determination can be made." But Liu refused. Zhang-君 then ordered that the deceased, Liu Miao-氏, female, was indeed poisoned to death before death. The body was handed over to her husband, Liu Dianlong, who signed a statement to claim it for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Smuggling Ring Case Involving Two Section Chiefs of the Police: Defendants Charged Under the Statute for the Punishment of Smuggling and Tax Evasion Claimed They Refused at the Time; Trial Concluded Yesterday <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Liu Shu'en, Chen Yousan, Zhang Baoren, Chen Shaoqing, Wang Daosan, etc., chiefs of the fourth section of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway police on the Shanghai-Xihu line, allegedly opened a room at the Quancheng Hotel near the Shanghai North Station in April of this year and invited Ma Rongqi and Yao Changtai, former policemen, to discuss the formation of a smuggling ring for copper coins and rayon. This was discovered by Chen Tiemeng, chief of the section, who reported it to Zhong Jianhun, the head of the section. The police were ordered to arrest Liu Shu'en, Chen Yousan, Zhang Baoren, Chen Shaoqing, etc., and detain them at the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Police Department. Yao Changtai, Ma Rongqi, Wang Daosan, etc., fled. They were immediately transferred to the District Court, where Prosecutor Lei Binzhang completed the investigation and prosecuted them under Articles 1, Section 4 and Section 5 of the Statute for the Punishment of Smuggling and Tax Evasion (both of which carry the death penalty). As public officials, they should also be punished more severely in accordance with Article 134 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, Judge Zhao Yongzhou opened the trial. Liu Shu'en, Chen Yousan, Zhang Baoren, Chen Shaoqing, etc., stated that they had served in the railway bureau for periods ranging from two to three decades. Although former policeman Yao Changtai had solicited them, they refused. Chen Tiemeng had made a false report to curry favor, and they requested a clear judgment. Thereupon, Prosecutor Lei issued his opinion, believing that the facts of the crime were proven. Finally, lawyer Zhang Yongqing defended them at length. The presiding judge announced the end of the debate and scheduled a date for sentencing.</p>

I was delighted to read it. (Omission) In addition to being happy, I am planning to try planting a small amount first. However, it's hard to get seedlings and seeds in abundance. Mr. Chen is warm-hearted and benefits the people, and it might be helpful if you could first go collect them so that small numbers of people who have ambitions may have the convenience to buy seeds.

<h3 id="e158">Olympic World Games International Leisure and Entertainment Conference Will Introduce the Leisure and Entertainment Methods of Various Countries as Much as Possible The Chairman of the World Games Committee Will Also Participate and Give a Speech <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The International Leisure and Entertainment Conference will be held in Hamburg from July 23 to 30. The conference is international in nature, and its value and importance are worth introducing. The conference has invited governments of various countries to come and visit. It is expected that not only European and Western countries, but also African, Asian, and American countries will send representatives to attend. The conference will introduce as much as possible the leisure and entertainment methods adopted by various countries' official, semi-official, or private parties, so that people from all countries can use their spare time for appropriate and possible pastimes. Furthermore, the conference will also have experts from various countries come to discuss various physical and mental rest and adjustment methods, so that individuals can increase their enjoyment of life and health, and the welfare of society must also be increased. The scope of the conference will cover not only culture, but also the economic use step by step.</p>
<p>Sir Perera, Chairman of the International Olympic Committee, believes that the appropriateness of sports and the enjoyment of life are closely related, so he has agreed to give a public speech after the opening of the conference. Sir Perera has just returned to his hometown of Bai Seluo from Finland and made a stop in Hamburg on the way. He expressed his admiration for Finland's beautiful sports business, but he did not say that the 12th World Games in 1940 will be held in Finland, because some people still advocate that the next conference will be held in Japan, and Japan's sports business has been completed. Sir's participation in the conference and promotion of physical leisure methods have attracted great attention from all walks of life. It is estimated that there will be millions of people from home and abroad coming to Hamburg to participate in the conference, so the pre-event arrangements are quite costly to plan, in order to ensure that the participants can participate satisfactorily. The chief of the general affairs department once said that "every time we come to Hamburg to participate in this arrangement work, it is not easy, we need to single-handedly pave a room of 50,000 rooms, the hotel side should be able to accommodate such a number of people, and most of the hotels have already been reserved by foreign travel agencies and tourists. Now, in order to entertain thoughtfully, we have prepared 40,000 single and double rooms - the facilities are very perfect - so Germans and people from all countries can come to Hamburg to participate in this unprecedented event, and there are trained guides there, who are under the management of the general affairs department of the conference, to do their best to serve, and there will be no any difficulties."</p>

<p>Yesterday, the public bond market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange showed a trend towards consolidation. Although the environment, such as the outbreak of war with the Guangdong army, was quite unfavorable, the market sentiment was extremely scattered and trading became more and more sluggish, so it was not agitated by the period. The long and short sides held on very firmly, but because one or two large players had a slight purchase, the market price immediately saw an increase. However, the situation in South China has entered a state of war, and there are many branches in North China. In the midst of environmental storms, the future of the bond market feels quite bleak, and there should be drastic changes. Yesterday's market opened with quite a few swap trades. No. 11, No. 4, and No. 47 were sold very actively, while No. 54, No. 6, and No. 32 were purchased. From Tong Wu to Tong Yi, there was a drop of 1 to 3.5 corners, while Tong Jia recently rose by 1 corner, and 96 also rose slightly by 2.4 corners. The closing market turned to rise, and Nos. 48 and 35 were purchased quite a bit. No. 11 was still being sold. Tong Wu Jia and others rose uniformly by 1.5 to 4 corners, and 96 continued to drop slightly by 1 corner. The closing result was that except for Tong Wu and 96, which fell by 1.5 to 4 corners from the previous day, the rest rose by 5 to 2.5 corners. The total number of transactions was 4.77 million yuan. The results of its gains and losses, highs and lows are compared and listed on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan).</p>
<h3 id="e162">Yarn and Cotton: Market Transactions Decrease, Near-Term Yarn's Downward Trend Does Not Weaken <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline, and the situation turned peaceful, not as violent as the previous day. This is because most of those with shallow pockets have settled, so market transactions have decreased. At the same time, spot yarn sales and native yarn are extremely scarce, and people are tired. However, the long side is very strong, and they came to pull up prices again at the afternoon close.</p>
<p>Forward Months Rise by 5 Corners Due to Short Covering</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened with a decline in US cotton, and market sentiment was sluggish. The current month opened with a fierce momentum, falling sharply by 1.9 yuan. August saw a slowdown, falling by 9 corners, while the forward months saw an increase of 4.5 corners. This is because some people adopted a strategy of buying on dips. The second session was slightly higher for the current month, while the forward months suddenly relaxed and fell. However, market transactions decreased significantly, and the momentum was calm. Approaching the third close, raw cotton rose, and short covering was even more common. As a result, the near-term months fell by 2.8 corners compared to the previous day's close, and the forward months rose by 4.5.6 corners. The afternoon opening for July and August was because spot yarn business was extremely quiet, and those holding goods sold a lot. The second session was mixed, up and down by 2.3.4 corners. Following the Osaka Sanpin yarn market, which once again trended downwards, the market became soft again. Until the close, the near-term months continued to weaken, and the long side came to pull up the prices again, resulting in the near-term months falling by 9 corners compared to the morning close, and the forward months falling by 1 corner. It was found that Da Fu sold 1,650 bales, Yu Da 1,200 bales, Da Feng 650 bales, Da Ji 1,400 bales, Ming De 1,500 bales, He Ju 600 bales, Tai Chang 1,250 bales, Da Chang 750 bales, Feng Tai 3,000 bales, Yong Da 800 bales, and Shen Ji 800 bales.

<p>Because the cotton market fell too sharply the previous day, yesterday's market sentiment was not affected by the fall in US cotton of 16 points. This is because the long position companies' idea of squeezing Chen Cotton has not been abandoned. It is said that they are entering in this account and exiting in that account, making it unpredictable and making people fall into a fog.</p>
<p>Long Positions Pulled Up Prices Once This Month</p>
<p>The spot cotton market opened with US cotton falling by 11 to 14 points, Indian cotton falling even more sharply, with Robbie falling by 2.25 to 4.75 Robbie. The Osaka Sanpin cotton market alone rose by 6.5 corners this month, and the forward months were flat. Market sentiment was peaceful, Chen Cotton fell by 2 corners, and new cotton was relatively stable and unchanged. After the market opened, the prices of each month varied, up and down by 5 cents to 1 corner, but market transactions were relatively rare. Until the close, the long side came to pull up the prices again this month, jumping sharply by 5 corners, and August also rose by 2 corners. New cotton rose by 5 cents to 2 corners. The afternoon opening was flat and listless, with each month falling by 1.2 corners. The second session still had no major entries and exits, and the close was flat.

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened, and the news from Liverpool and Mumbai was not good. Liverpool, the Far East, the Mainland, and Wall Street sold off. The weather report was favorable, and each month fell by 12 to 16 points. Then, local merchants and fellow merchants bought in, and the market situation rebounded strongly.

Spot goods are scarce and strong, and the textile market is lively. English cotton spot fell by 14 points, and futures fell by 9 to 10 points.

It is said that in addition to some loads sold to Shanghai, there are also many people from various villages who have heard the news and directly transport them for sale.</p>

<p>The inventory of Japanese artificial silk in each store is low, and the buying is strong, so the market price has risen by several yuan again. The price of 120 Tianqiao brand is 417 yuan, and the price of 120 Taiyang Meinu brand is 405 yuan, with more than 20 boxes traded. Yesterday, local merchants, silk factories, and Rong sources purchased goods from a certain store.

<p>Because there are not many high-quality Zhenmei teas, and the price of the second-quality tea is too high, the market suddenly turned sluggish yesterday. Only more than 100 boxes of low Zhuang Xiumei Xie He were processed at a price of 16 yuan, and Tu Zhuang Chou Zhen Jin Long Tian Yu each had 100 boxes traded at a price of 88 yuan to 94 yuan. The transaction of other Zhenmei teas was particularly quiet. Jinlong and other firms in Pingshui Daba still had a slight appetite. Xiuqing tea Wanquanqing Lu character and other firms have successively traded, and the wholesale price is still similar to the previous one. In this region, second-grade Xiumei, Xie He and Du De each had 200 boxes processed at a price of 16 yuan to 20 yuan.

<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market situation was because spot yarn and cotton and foreign cotton continued to fall, and although various merchants and the local street had greatly absorbed them during the previous frenzy, actual transactions did not improve. Therefore, store owners' hand goods and some of the surplus blank cloth quotas from dyeing factories are quite willing to sell. Because the situation in Guangdong is unstable, the large amount of this factory's fine twill absorbed before still has a profit of 3 to 4 corners per piece in the current market, and they are now being transferred out in Shanghai. Because of these several layers of pressure on the market, although the factory plate is still solid, the trend has suddenly weakened. The prices of local fine cloth and fine twill fell, but only 5 cents to 1 corner per piece, the price of city cloth 84 fell 1 corner per piece, the price of this factory's fine twill fell 1 to 2 corners, and the price of bleached cloth fell 1 corner. Because the previous increase in prices for local fine cloth, coarse cloth, and coarse twill was moderate and there is a lack of spot fine cloth, the selling plates have not been changed. The purchases of various merchants and local streets have been greatly reduced.</p>

<p>The 2998th auction of Yuan Fang was held yesterday, and a total of 26 brands and 26 boxes of various goods were displayed. The market situation was quite active. The two brands of Jia Jiao San Xia Yi Se Tian of Tai Xi satin, which had not been listed for a long time, were fiercely purchased in the industry, so the price stood out. The addition of the Zhu Lin Dong Hua brands of feather satin also made the price firm. The market price of Tai Xi satin was 1 or 2 points better per yard than the previous period, the price of Yuan velvet rose by 2.5 corners, and the price of straight-selling wool also rose by 3 cents. Yuan Yu silk 18 brands, Cai Ba Shi, Jiu Lian Deng, Yu Yun brand all rose by 6 corners, and the rest all rose by 2 or 3 corners. The price of the red cloth Jia Jiao 8 pounds was also strong.

<p>Palicos has been selling well in the market recently, and there is a lack of inventory in the stores, so it has continued to rise again. Although the price of Yihe Shenzhi Palicos has been quoted at 2.9 yuan per yard, it is still not easy to find, and the colors are all incomplete. The Japanese goods of Ito, Jiu Fu, Yong Feng, etc., still have inventory in the stores, but the spot goods in the foreign firms have long been out of stock. Yesterday, the retail price of Palicos from Kuai Fa Cai in the market could not be obtained for less than 3.4 yuan of national currency, and Jiu Fu Ito was 3.6 yuan. The lowest price of Western goods must be 4.4 yuan, and the lower-grade goods were sold out last week.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the 期麥 market, after opening in the morning, showed an initial rise, followed by a flat, and then a steady trend in each month. The quotation of 洋麥, Chicago rebounded by 7 or 8 corners, and Canada rebounded by 5, 6, or 7 corners. When the price was opened, the market sentiment was stabilized due to the rebound of 洋麥, which was generally more stable than the previous day. However, after the long positions gradually sold out, it fell back slightly. Until the market opened in the afternoon, the market for July 回廠方擯住現貨 was still flat, and there were few transactions. Although the transactions in the forward months were also sluggish, they were inevitably supported by the fact that 洋麥 was reported to be rising, which was 1 to 3 points better than the previous day. Observing the following steps, if speculation is reduced, the market should be able to enter the right track. The current 麦 market is not selling well, and the factories are only slightly moving their appetites, tending towards the 擯局. Kaiming Guang, Sha He Ji, Yang He, Zhang Ba Ling 麦 was 4.53 yuan, a total of 2,000 bags, which was purchased by 福新.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, was still quiet. There were very few formal transactions in the market, and most of them were for settlement, and new buying and selling were out of the question. As for the rumored 暗盤, the籌碼 for this month is relatively lacking, and the quotation is slightly raised due to the rebound of 洋麥 of 5, 6, 7, or 8 corners, approximately between 5 and 6 points, but August is quite濫, so it is only between 1 and 2 points.</p>
<p>###秈米 客Sales Active, Market Prices Turn Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of 客秈 was still strong. Because the prices in Hunan and Jiangxi were cheap, and there was a move to reduce donations and taxes, the arrival source should be able to continue to be active in the future. The arrival was strong, but the sales were fine, so the market gradually weakened. And 客 who have a real sales appetite, after seeing the rice market stepping down day by day, take little after processing, and dare not ask for it. After the sale went dormant, the market became even more unsustainable. In addition to the usual social activities in this street yesterday, 內地 sources asked about medium and second-grade machines in the morning and evening, and 北洋 also processed 510 bags of Hunan oily rice. The market began to turn stable. A total of 3,150 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,510 bags of Hunan rice, and 200 bags of Anhui rice were opened throughout the day.

<p>(Shanghai Japan) Yesterday, there were more than 20 sources from various 河政 roads. The sales of goods in the city sleep market were sparsely due to the non-stop heavy rain. Although there were some sales, the price increase was similar to the previous one, only the fresh-topped 薄稻 was firm.</p>

<p>The first batch of 蘭竹枝 was seen yesterday. Because the body color was inferior, the opening price was less than 30 yuan. After the experts purchased it, they still had to select it, and the selling plate would inevitably increase. The 鳥葉枝 and 早紅枝 were similar to the previous ones, and the second 荘 was slightly reduced. According to the production price, it must be a loss. There is hope that the back market will loosen.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Red Nose <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>It was a bit of a surprise to see that burly old man with the red nose again in a small, half-open shop on the ancient Hulong Street, sitting foolishly at the doorway, smoking a water pipe, and watching over a small candy stall.</p>
<p>I was somewhat astonished that the red nose had changed so much.</p>
<p>Seven or eight years ago, when I was in middle school, there was a time when a few companions and I were very interested in learning to carve seals. Every Saturday and Sunday, we would go to the shops on Hulong Street that bought and sold old cultural relics to buy some cheap seal stones. At that time, the red-nosed old man had a very respectable antique shop in another area of Huyou Street. There were glass cabinets lined up at the door, and he had many antique collectibles. We often went to his shop to buy seal stones. He had more seal stones than other shops, but the red nose was very temperamental. When you went to buy things from him, you often had to put up with his arrogant manner of speaking.</p>
<p>We only bought inferior stones that cost a dozen or so copper coins each, but the red nose often thought that such small business was a nuisance to him. Sometimes he would deliberately take out stone seals that cost two or three yuan each and tell us that he also had ones that cost dozens of yuan each. His face turned as red as a tomato, and he would sniff his red nose, pinching the fleshy lump on the left side of his cheek repeatedly. His eyes, filled with red veins, would widen, and his purplish-red lips would tremble. He would always impatiently say to us:</p>
<p>—Trouble, trouble, you only buy such cheap things. If you want good ones, buy the ones that cost two yuan and five jiao each. They are really good seal stones.</p>
<p>We often went to his shop to bother him and always did small business of about one mao (tenth of a yuan). His way of speaking always looked down on us. A few times when we went there, he would just smoke his water pipe and ignore us. After we greeted him, he would impatiently sniff his red nose and take out some of the worst hard stones.</p>
<p>Later, we didn't want to bother him with his bad temper anymore. One reason was that we were busy with schoolwork and didn't have time to be distracted by those small hobbies. Another reason was that we had spent a lot of money, but our carving skills hadn't improved. Moreover, the graduation exam was approaching, and the problem of finding a job after graduation was still unresolved. So, we no longer had the leisure to put our hearts into the small hobby of carving stones.</p>
<p>From then on, we no longer went to the red nose's antique shop. Occasionally, when we passed by his shop, we would see him leisurely smoking in the glass cabinet.</p>
<p>After leaving middle school, we groped aimlessly in society for a living. For many years, sorrow and indignation filled our hearts, and the mood for learning to carve seals that we had in those years was long gone.</p>
<p>Carrying the sorrow of unemployment, I returned to the ancient city. Unexpectedly, I saw that red nose again. I never thought that the big-shot antique shop owner would be so down on his luck now. His once-respectable antique shop had closed down, and he had moved to such a small, half-open shop. The red nose had been defeated by life and had even started a small candy stall business.</p>
<p>I stopped blankly for a while by that candy stall. The red nose probably didn't recognize me. How could he know that I had also returned to the ancient city carrying the sorrow of being defeated by life!</p>
<h3 id="e178">Hope <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>It was only the beginning of spring.</p>
<p>After several days of rain, a northwest wind blew, and it cleared up. The threshing ground, which had been trampled by chickens and ducks, was full of footprints. The low-lying areas were still flooded with water, and the river was also full.</p>
<p>Near the pier, a boat was tied with a cable. Old Jinshui stood on the pier, sending off his two sons, who were taking shovels, earth baskets, rakes, brooms, and other soil-moving tools onto the boat. They planned to go to town to collect garbage today.</p>
<p>Every year, the farming families in the village have to put a little fertilizer in the fields. They can't afford fertilizer powder, and even human manure is considered too expensive. The fertilizer they usually use is garbage ash, which is made by piling up garbage into a small mountain and setting it on fire. It smolders for six or seven days until it is all burned into ash, which is used to fertilize the fields. This is the cheapest fertilizer. However, most of the people in the village are farmers, and poor families usually can't bear to throw things away, so there isn't much garbage. They have no choice but to go to town to collect it.</p>
<p>After the tools were secured, the boat pushed off from the shore.</p>
<p>Near the surface of the pond, a thin layer of ice had formed. Sanbao held the scull, and Sixi and Old Jinshui sat at the bow of the boat. The boat was light, and the river water was high. It rocked from side to side very badly. Sometimes the boat got close to the pond, and the ice scraped against the edge of the boat, making a rustling sound.</p>
<p>It takes a long time to go from the village to town by water. Old Jinshui smoked his pipe and chatted idly. The lines etched on his dry face explained his hard experiences, a great resume.</p>
<p>The boat was like a drunkard, staggering forward. Old Jinshui talked with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"Hey! You were just children then! Abao was only four years old, and you were still nursing. It was the first year of Xuantong. The sun was really poisonous that year. The cracks in the fields were a foot wide. The disaster was as bad as last year."</p>
<p>Old Jinshui paused here, took a few puffs of his pipe, and continued:</p>
<p>"But the second year was a good year. The early rice grew to half our height, and we harvested more than four bags. The two seasons made up for the losses of the first year. I turned things around that time."</p>
<p>Erbao stopped sculling, letting the boat drift on the water. He listened almost entranced, not even noticing the oncoming boat. By the time he heard the shout "Boat coming, keep to the side!", it was too late to turn, and the two boats bumped heavily into each other. After hearing the ferryman on the other side grumble, the boats went their separate ways.</p>
<p>"Does that mean this year will be a good year?" Sixi asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, the old saying goes, 'The first eight days are sunny, a good year!' The first eight days of this year were good weather. And it snowed all winter last year."</p>
<p>The flame of hope burned in Old Jinshui's heart, burning in Sanbao's heart, and in Sixi's heart. Happiness, like spring grass, sprouted in this dead, gray wilderness.</p>
<p>"If that's the case, we have to buy our own cow, so we don't have to borrow from this family and that family and still have to watch their faces," Sanbao suggested.</p>
<p>"And I have to make a set of white cotton short shirt and trousers like my brother," Sixi also said his long-awaited wish.</p>
<p>Old Jinshui smiled. Ha! Ha! Ha! He tapped the ashes out of his pipe on the edge of the boat, refilled it, and smoked it. His eyes contained the glow of warm hope, like that of a young man waiting for his lover. He was so urgent and so full of happy premonition that he completely forgot last year's disaster, forgot the days of hunger and cold.</p>
<p>Sanbao took off his short cotton jacket and shook it vigorously. The sun slowly rose, and the boat sculled closer and closer to its destination.</p>
<p>By the time they arrived in town, it was already noon. The vendors selling fresh goods had already left the market, and the streets were damp. The father and sons ate some dry rations they had brought with them in the boat. They picked up their collection tools and jumped ashore.</p>
<p>Several of the shops in town were closed, some with large red papers pasted on them, and some with white-bottomed black-character strips. But most of them were still open. The shop assistants leaned against the counters, idly watching the pedestrians on the street. There were two streets in the whole town, with about a hundred shops in front and back. On odd-numbered days, farmers from the surrounding villages would come here to the market, and fishermen from the coast would also bring some fresh goods to exchange for money, so some business would still come to these shopkeepers. But in recent years, the shops in the eyes of the farmers have gradually become showrooms. They strictly adhered to the motto "Only allowed to visit, not allowed to touch." They didn't buy anything because they couldn't afford it.</p>
<p>The more sluggish the business in the shops, the more they wanted to attract buyers. They hung up big "discount" flags in front of their doors and beat gongs and drums. The sound of the gongs and drums conveyed a desolate and empty tune, but it still sounded lively at first.</p>
<p>This excitement made Sanbao and Sixi feel interested. They collected garbage while watching the scenery, like watching the City God's Fair in the second month. The windows of the foreign goods store displayed exquisite household items; the snack shop constantly emitted the aroma of travelers' saliva; the foreign cloth store hung various kinds of clothing. When Sixi thought that as soon as the beginning of autumn came, he could pick out a fine piece of clothing here, the garbage he was carrying on his shoulders suddenly felt lighter.</p>
<p>Old Jinshui urged them on, but he was also very happy. The reason for his happiness was that after a few days of rain, there were not many people coming to town to collect garbage, so the garbage had accumulated very high. In previous years, they had to go door-to-door to ask, but this time, it came right to them, which was very convenient. This convenience seemed to foretell a good harvest this year. Plenty, abundance, Old Jinshui had already foreseen the days when he would turn things around again.</p>
<p>Because they loaded a little more, it was evening before they had a full boat. Tired bodies wrapped in excited hearts, they washed their hands, feet, and the scull stirred the river water, and that's how they started their return journey.</p>
<p>The garbage was full, containing coal ash, rags, animal bones, and fish scales. These things, burned into ash and used to fertilize the fields, were very nourishing for the rice. They can make the rice grow quickly and form heavy ears of grain, which can be exchanged for money, bought cows, made white cotton shirts and trousers, and built up a golden harvest from these.</p>
<p>This boat full of garbage is a boat full of hope.</p>
<p>The one sculling was still Sanbao. Old Jinshui held his pipe and sat at the bow of the boat, his eyes looking at Sixi's back as he pulled the rope on the shore. The setting sun on the west mountain, with a touch of red light, slowly faded away. Everyone only ate a little dry rations at noon, and after a day of labor, their stomachs were rumbling, so they were especially eager to get home. However, the garbage had been rained on, and the weight was quite considerable. The heavier the boat's draft, the slower it rocked, and the louder their stomachs rumbled.</p>
<p>"I'm starving!" Erbao said.</p>
<p>"For the sake of future fullness. You must be patient," Old Jinshui put down his pipe. "This year's garbage is plentiful and good. Buried in the fields, it's sure to be a good harvest!"</p>
<p>"We should have brought more snacks and a lantern. Look, it's already getting dark!"</p>
<p>As Sanbao said this, he perked up and started to scull harder. The boat began to move from side to side. This force was transmitted from the tow rope to Sixi on the shore, and he also pulled harder. The boat did indeed move a little faster. The waves at the bow of the boat splashed high, like tens of thousands of bright pearls jumping.</p>
<p>Old Jinshui was so tired that he closed his eyes, wanting to doze off.</p>
<p>Although more than half of the journey had already passed, the sky became even darker. A few sparse stars were nailed to the grayish-blue sky. The distant villages were submerged in the misty night. The air in early spring was quiet. Sanbao tried his best to scull. The side of the boat closest to the water was originally only two or three inches away, but at this time, with the boat tilting, water poured in mouthful by mouthful. Hunger made people impatient, fatigue made people careless, and the dark night obscured people's eyes and people's conscience.</p>
<p>Sixi on the shore felt that the tow rope was getting heavier with each step, but he thought it was because he was too tired from working so hard during the day. So he put all his strength into pulling desperately. After a few steps, with a "snap," the tow rope broke, and Sixi rushed forward.</p>
<p>"Ah!" Sanbao cried out.</p>
<p>Old Jinshui was startled and opened his eyes, only to see a vast expanse of white. The bow and stern of the boat were still exposed on the surface of the water, but the garbage in the middle cabin had already drunk its fill of water. It took the grain, the cow, the white cotton short shirt and trousers, the abundance, the fullness, the hopes of these three father and sons, and sank slowly along with the boat.</p>

<p>— Xijin</p>
<p>——Rereading Gorky's poem on January 20</p>
<p>The petrel is flying in the sky again,</p>
<p>Flapping its wings and suddenly soaring;</p>
<p>A long and loud cry,</p>
<p>A bright figure, crossing the sky,</p>
<p>Reflected in the dark and gloomy sea...</p>
<p>The gale roars on the water,</p>
<p>Churning up towering waves:</p>
<p>Heavy rain strikes down the weak white seagulls,</p>
<p>The dark clouds in the sky turn and crush out</p>
<p>Thousands of lightning bolts and deafening thunderclaps;</p>
<p>The petrel loves to fly in its storm,</p>
<p>The more it flies in the turbulent waves, the more courageous it appears,</p>
<p>Flying over the waves, flying over the foot of the clouds,</p>
<p>In the struggle, it shows off its invincible joy!</p>
<p>The shrinking clear water crow is swallowed by the white waves,</p>
<p>The shores where the penguins hide are also washed away;</p>
<p>The triumphant petrel shouts out a prophecy of victory:</p>
<p>"After the storm, there will be clear weather ahead!"</p>

<p>— Zigang</p>
<p>Whenever there was a yellow wind blowing for a day or deep snow, Old Zhong didn't want to force himself to the street to do business. His stall was moved from the street corner to the front of his own courtyard, and the small screen wall became a natural windbreak. Under the blue cloth top, Old Zhong's black cloth vest shone. His hands were red and swollen as he pulled the dough, like arranging an array. He segmented it on the pressing board. The little moustache was covered with condensed breath, flashing in the dim sky light. He shivered again, and his heart cried out for cold.</p>
<p>"More sesame seeds!"</p>
<p>"Be careful, don't bake it too burnt or too tender. If it's not crispy, it's not formal!"</p>
<p>"Put more sesame seeds, it's fragrant!"</p>
<p>Even though it was a business of two copper coins each, the customers were still troublesome and picky with him.</p>
<p>Old Zhong didn't even raise his eyes to talk back. He blew up the sparks that were about to go out from the wind, rolled the sesame seed in the sesame seed, looked up at the top of the canopy, and then lowered his head again. People also temporarily closed their mouths.</p>
<p>"Old Zhong, why were you so unlucky last night, ha ha ha!"</p>
<p>"Yesterday, that hand of cards wouldn't fight with me. Nian Chang San, leave Yao Er... that's enough!"</p>
<p>The "Black Zhang Fei" from the coal shop across the street or the partners who pulled the monthly (carriage) came to find the old man, yawning.</p>
<p>The hunched black vest straightened up suddenly, shaking off two drops of water stuck on the top of his moustache. Old Zhong wiped his nose with the oil-stained sleeves. "Damn, I don't know what's plaguing my heart. I'm just having bad luck. Don't even think about getting a good hand. Alas, I'm old and worthless! I, with my bad eyesight, picked the wrong card on the ground. It's my fault for playing it wrong..."</p>
<p>Old Zhong burst out laughing from the bottom of his heart, wanting to wipe his hands with his apron and straighten his back to have a "chat", but couldn't resist the urging of the people beside him. His loud voice shook like a clumsy camel bell in the wind and snow:</p>
<p>"Okay, can't you wait a while? Isn't our old story good? The bad one last night will definitely be 'better' tonight. I, Old Zhong, will win at least once in ten hands. I dare not boast about anything else! Old Zhang Fei, you wait, tonight, Brother Xiang and the others will peel your skin..."</p>
<p>Old Zhong's "ha ha ha" was drowned out by the reprimands of the customers.</p>
<p>The widowed woman Wang from the west entrance liked to recite a passage:</p>
<p>"Old Zhong is really a fool. He's been a bachelor his whole life, sending all his money to paper cards and pai gow. Doesn't he have an acre of sorghum land at home that he doesn't plant? Old Zhong, isn't that right? No brothers, no nephews, I'm saying, isn't he a fool, giving away the ten or so strings of money he earns with his ten fingers to the black charcoal guys every day!" She twisted her head, examining the "qian'er" (a kind of hair accessory), and went west, very happy to express her opinions. This stirred up a burst of laughter:</p>
<p>"Why don't you talk, Brother Zhong! Are you afraid of talking and playing?"</p>
<p>"Old Zhong is shy," said someone, probably the pockmarked sister-in-law, lightly adding, "Brother Zhong has never been near a woman in his fifty years!"</p>
<p>"Just buy the sesame cakes, that's all. Why chat about eighteen strings of things? Chatting about 'gambling' is not far off, but it's always about women, no children..." He turned red with anger, and his big hands, stained with sesame paste, waved back and forth: "I, Old Zhong, had no life to marry when I was young. Who's to blame? When I was strong, I could barely fill half my stomach. Who's to blame? Now, what's enough with a few strings left? My head is bald too - who's to blame?" He took advantage of a moment of free time to dry his hands and light a dry cigarette:</p>
<p>"Why don't you let me rest and look at the cards? I say - why? I've suffered all my life, I've worked hard all my life, and I should take a breather! I suffer and get angry in other things, only on a few cards, I call the shots; I pick whoever I pick; I discard whoever I discard, just like I've been pulled and pushed by people for decades," he chewed and savored it repeatedly like betel nut: "Pulled, pushed, beaten, scolded... Oh, more than fifty years..."</p>
<p>Everyone knew that Old Zhong had carried a gun, worked as an apprentice, and performed tricks, until a month before selling sesame cakes, Old Zhong was still sweating profusely on the street, begging for money from the spectators. But when he was unexpectedly disappointed, he angrily cursed and didn't show his face for a few days.</p>
<p>Under everyone's serious silence, Old Zhong suddenly laughed wildly, and some of the shadows in his heart were driven away by this tearless wail. He saw the blue sky outside his blue canopy again. The old man's felt boots moved loosely a few times.</p>
<p>He would subconsciously arrange the pieces of dough into dots on playing cards or dominoes, sighing to himself:</p>
<p>"Plum blossom pair! Heavenly bar is coming, wonderful! Oh, what a pity! Bring another one..." He went into thought.</p>
<p>Beside the candied haws wooden basket, he would also stop, squeezing his eyebrows and smoking. When the children played marbles on the ground, he would also listen:</p>
<p>"Old Zhong, are you coming, one big coin a game! Let's fight!"</p>
<p>This old fellow would be coy at first, and if there were not many adults around, he would clumsily squat down slowly. He would forget himself clapping his hands. He cleared his throat and shouted, as if saying: It's my turn to pick you and push you!</p>
<p>There were a few days when Old Zhong automatically stopped working, which was when there were weddings or funerals nearby. Among the group of drummers and coffin pullers squatting on the ground playing pai gow or dice, Old Zhong sat on the ground like a big Buddha, staring at the dice, his big hands patting on his legs.</p>
<p>When he had lost all his money and business was slack for a while, Old Zhong would take out a deck of cards and play against himself on the pressing board, putting down one card with his left hand and picking up one with his right hand, moving sesame seeds back and forth to determine the outcome.</p>
<p>He was still muttering:</p>
<p>"I pick you, and I can say I don't want you, you, dare to say no!"</p>
<p>"Like this, this will come fairly, and everyone has nothing to say, fairly! The world of the bastards is not fair!" He swallowed the last sentence.</p>

<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>—One of the Random Picks—</p>
<p>The Palace Museum is restoring the Qing Dynasty literary inquisition archives. There are many tragedies and many comedies. To say that those who broke the law, who really wanted to rebel against the Qing and restore the Ming, and become national heroes, seem to be few; most are like "Zhu Maichen" characters, who want to covet temporary wealth and offer books, but cannot get their wish. It is quite interesting that they then offered their own annotated versions of the Book of Poetry and the Book of Changes to Emperor Qianlong, hoping that the emperor would act as a matchmaker for them and grant them an "Imperial Mandate Wedding." Among them, the most pitiable and tragic ending is the case of Ding Wenbin's Great Xia Great Ming New Book.</p>
<p>Ding Wenbin, a native of Shangyu, Zhejiang, grew up in Hangzhou. During the Yongzheng period, he lived with his elder brother and sister-in-law in Songjiang for more than ten years. His brother and sister-in-law were very poor and made a living by selling cakes and doing odd jobs, but they did not expect this good brother to cause them big trouble. In May of the sixteenth year of Qianlong, Ding Wenbin went alone to the Duke Yansheng's mansion in Qufu, Shandong, to offer books (the Great Xia Great Ming New Book and the Zhaowu Reign Era Almanac). He said that when the old Duke Yansheng was alive, he had promised to marry his two daughters to him. Besides the marriage, he also wanted to pass on the throne. The special commissioner interrogated him severely. Let's take a look at his confession:</p>
<p>Question: "You are from a humble background, and now you look like a beggar. How could Duke Yansheng be willing to marry you? Moreover, there is no reason to promise two daughters to one person, and there is no matchmaker. This is obviously a false accusation!"</p>
<p>Answer: "My marriage is by the order of God, so why need a matchmaker? One husband and two wives are the way of Yao and Shun. Shun married Yao's two daughters, which is well-documented. The old Duke Yansheng was no different, so he passed the throne to me and married his two daughters to me. This was all inspired by God. I heard that Duke Yansheng had passed away, so I took over the throne, and it has been eight years now. Because no one helps me, I don't even have food to eat... The people in the South do not understand the great truth. They don't pay attention to me, so I had no choice but to write this book..."</p>
<p>Question: "How did you make him the Holy Emperor and send drafts to the women of the Kong family? Who is the daughter of that Dong family? Confess everything!"</p>
<p>Answer: "God's will is always that those with virtue have position. The old Duke Yansheng was able to uphold the way of Yao and Shun, so he should be in the position of Emperor. I was taught the way of Yao and Shun by the Holy Duke, as if he passed the throne to me, so I respected him as the Holy Emperor in the book and also called him the Artistic Ancestor. In the past, when Shun received the throne from Yao, he also called him the Artistic Ancestor. The book containing a mother-in-law and wife was all written by myself, and I did not send it out, and I don't remember which year it was... The book also said that Dong was to be a concubine; that Dong family is from Songjiang, her father is called Dong Hengshan, who runs a tea house. I had no food to eat, so I helped him fan the bellows for half a year. Seeing that his daughter was only fifteen years old and looked good, I thought in my heart and recorded it in the book."</p>
<p>Question: "In your book, you made Kong the eldest uncle the Grand Secretary, and Kong the uncle the Grand Minister of Rites, and Kong the uncle the Grand Minister of Education. What are their names? You also made your elder brother Duke Wen of Xia, and your parents King and Queen. Where were they enfeoffed? Did you have any edicts or other items for them?"</p>
<p>Answer: "Kong Lei is the Duke Yansheng. The officials and original investigators were all from the Kong family, so I casually recorded what I wanted to grant. My elder brother's name is Ding Wenyao, and my sister-in-law Qin sells sesame cakes in Songjiang. This year, he is helping in a noodle shop. He is a person who does not understand reason and often scolds me for being crazy, so I said in my book that my brother is stubborn and my sister-in-law is arrogant. Because I took the throne, I should treat him with courtesy, so I wrote it in the book."</p>
<p>Question: "You also forged six copies of the Almanac. How dare you write the words 'Imperial Decree' without authorization? You have been falsely claiming to be on the throne for eight years. Why are there two copies of each item, only six or seven...?"</p>
<p>Answer: "I only have one person writing and copying books. Because God ordered me to rush to revise this Great Plan of the Spring and Autumn Annals, I could not have the time to create this new book. It was not until the sixth year of my enthronement that I started to create it, and I only created it for three years. Great Xia is my country name, and Tianyuan is the reign era. Because I did nothing good, I asked God last year to change Tianyuan to Zhaowu and pass the throne to the Little Holy Duke. Since there is a reign era, I wrote Imperial Decree. As for writing 'Great Xia' and 'Great Ming' on the cover of the book, it means to cultivate virtue; 'Great Xia' means to implement the time of Xia."</p>
<p>This matter is very clear. The memorial of Yang Yingju, the governor of Shandong, also said: "Ding Wenbin is a person of extreme poverty and lowliness. Once he learned a little bit of old sayings, he boasted himself as a genius and exceptional talent, unmatched by anyone. Because he fantasized about wealth, noble women, and lust, his delusional mind grew stronger and could not be broken. He肆肆(transliteration error in source material)indulged in his fierce heart, howling like a wolf and barking like a dog, stopping at nothing." However, the ending of this event was not to treat Ding Wenbin as a mentally deranged person. In June of the eighteenth year of Qianlong, Ding Wenbin was executed by dismemberment by imperial decree. In September of the eighteenth year of Qianlong, his son Ding Wenyao, nephew Ding Shixian, and Ding Shilin were sentenced according to the law and should be beheaded after the autumn. Still, the son under the age of fifteen, Ding Shiliang and Ding Shiwei, were sent to the Ministry to become slaves. Wang Suxing saw the rebellious book and did not report it, so he was punished with one hundred strokes of the bamboo and exiled three thousand miles according to the law. Cai Yingda and Xu Xuchu mixed up to read the heretical book, each punished with eighty strokes of the bamboo. This meaning is very clear: the "sage and wise" Emperor Qianlong used Ding Wenbin, this madman, as an example of "killing the chicken to scare the monkey," so that everyone would not dare to hide rebellious books or shield rebellious people; that is to say: seeing a rebellious document, one must report it.</p>
<p>This comedy ended here, and the Great Xia Great Ming Emperor and Duke Wen of Xia and his son were sent to the execution ground together.</p>

<h3 id="e183">How to Become a Healthy and Beautiful Woman A Letter from a Girl <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am a girl who pays the most attention to hygiene, and I always dream of becoming a healthy woman. Unfortunately, my physique is the opposite. Not only is my development small, but I am also far from meeting the conditions for health and beauty. This is the regret I have had for several years! But I firmly believe that this shortcoming will be made up for by me one day. I have such strong self-confidence, and my current success is certainly not accidental.</p>
<p>My incomplete development, according to the judgment of most doctors, is entirely due to congenital deficiency. When I stepped into ×× Girls' High School to study, the school doctor did not allow me to enroll because my physique was too weak. According to the examination results, I was suffering from severe neurasthenia and was suspected of having lung disease, so it was not suitable for me to study.</p>
<p>Indeed, I do have neurasthenia, so I usually feel sudden dizziness, blurred vision, tinnitus, heart palpitations, and even irregular menstruation. However, due to my physical condition, I was deprived of the opportunity to seek knowledge, which is no different from driving me into hell. I was extremely angry and went home in a fit of pique, preparing to end my life by suicide!</p>
<p>"Suicide" is the behavior of the weak. I am an educated woman, so how can I embark on a dead end? Therefore, I realized it again. From then on, I diligently researched methods of health preservation. I tried my best to collect and read all kinds of magazines and newspapers about medicine. Therefore, I understand that the mechanical structure of the human body completely relies on blood to maintain. To maintain the blood from never drying up, it is necessary for the endocrine glands to be flexible, and the health of the gonads is the most important, so that they can fully develop. Based on this principle, I constantly tried to take the "Female Gonadal Hormone" gonadotropin preparation, and at the same time did regular exercises to activate my blood vessels. It has been about two months like this? My body is very strong, and my weight has increased from seventy pounds to ninety-two pounds. All the previous clothes are too small, especially in the breast part. After another two months, the situation has completely changed. Not only has my weight increased by another eleven pounds, but my muscles have also become firmer. The development of my breasts is particularly plump, and I do not feel tired even after working all day long. The previous neurasthenia, lung weakness, and menstrual diseases have long been cured. This spring, I re-entered ×× Girls' High School to study. When the classmates saw my physique, they all praised me and unanimously called me the "Health and Beauty Queen." Just think, if I did not take "Gonadal Hormone," wouldn't I still be immersed in the sea of suffering? Because I think this process has great value for my fellow patients to learn from, I ask you to open a corner of your esteemed publication to publish it on my behalf, and I don't think it will be rejected! Sincerely, Feng Jie</p>
<p>Gonorrhea</p>
<p>— Dr. Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<h3 id="e184">Post-Urethritis and Epididymitis <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Gonorrhea is so changeable that its danger is particularly noteworthy. If you choose a doctor and medicine carelessly, gonorrhea invades the posterior urethra and can cause posterior urethritis. You can test the discharged urine, and the turbidity before and after is quite obvious.</p>
<p>Why does gonorrhea invade the posterior urethra? It may be caused by various actions or careless washing in the early stages. Other causes include erection of the penis, pus flowing back from the front end to the back; patients not taking care of themselves, and doctors not being meticulous in their hygiene can all cause this disease.</p>
<p>After gonorrhea has invaded the posterior urethral part, the first sign is frequent urination, and there are obvious bleeding symptoms. At this time, the patient should take the yellow pigment preparation "Andi Lin" to surround the gonorrhea. The membrane-penetrating bactericidal power of "Andi Lin" is great, and its efficacy has special advantages. All knowledgeable and experienced doctors can say this, and it is by no means empty words.</p>
<h3 id="e185">The Relationship between Cerebral Hemorrhage and Bone Pain <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Liu Zhimin</p>
<p>Cerebral hemorrhage is also known as brain hemorrhage. Because everyone's brain has countless arteries beating. Among them, the local blood vessels called "Internal *" are the most easily damaged. But what causes it? Because from the heart through the head artery to this part, it is almost a blood line, directly feeling the power of the blood flow from the heart; when the heart is excited and the blood pressure is very high, this part is subject to fierce conflict, of course, it will be easily damaged. Near the internal *, there are nerves that control the movement of the hands and feet. If this part bleeds, the motor nerves are compressed by the blood clot, and cannot be used, resulting in hemiplegia.</p>
<p>The left side of the brain, in addition to the nerves that control the hands and feet, also has the language center, which of course is also harmed. Therefore, seven or eight out of ten people who suffer from cerebral hemorrhage and fall unconscious will have confused speech and a confused mind.</p>
<p>To sum up, the formation of cerebral hemorrhage is due to the rupture of blood vessels, and the rupture of blood vessels is purely due to the hardening of blood vessels. If we already feel uncomfortable shoulders and arms, sore wrists, numbness in the muscles and bones, and pain in the waist, back, etc., then the hardening of the large arteries has reached its extreme. Therefore, anyone with ordinary medical knowledge, after discovering the symptoms, should quickly find a way to prevent the arrival of danger. The first step is to cure the bone pain. If you can carefully implement the treatment in this way, then the disease of cerebral hemorrhage is not terrible.</p>
<p>The most effective and ideal method for curing bone pain is to use Strongstin's "Bone Pain Pills," because it can not only treat all bone pain, but also has unparalleled ability to prevent arteriosclerosis. Therefore, people who suffer from bone pain and patients with arteriosclerosis, do not hesitate to let your disease deteriorate.</p>
<h3 id="e186">The Relationship between Seminal Emission and Life <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yu Bofu</p>
<p>Suffering from seminal emission has become a common phenomenon among young people. Because so many young people suffer from seminal emission, young people who are troubled by neurasthenia are also particularly numerous.</p>
<p>The reasons why young people suffer from seminal emission can be divided into three parts for observation. One, masturbation promotes the relaxation of the sperm lock. Two, gonorrhea causes prostatitis, leading to damage to the function of the vas deferens. Three, due to physiological reasons, the body's sperm center is oversensitive, and nocturnal emission occurs from time to time. Separating these three points, the latter is less dangerous than the first two.</p>
<p>However, it can be determined that a person suffering from severe seminal emission is bound to be mentally weakened. Brain power is bound to be weak. Everything, everything, is lifeless, and there is no hope for the future. You can only wait for the slaughter of the god of death.</p>
<p>In the early stages of suffering from this disease, every night, dreams are upside down, and semen flows out. When you wake up, it is too late, and it is easier to flow out after excessive labor. If the number of times is frequent, the disease has turned into deterioration. In severe cases, the patient has almost no interruption for several days, and it can also flow out during the day if the genitals accidentally rub against clothes or bedding. This is entirely because the vas deferens is relaxed and loses control. Just think, semen is the life gland of the human body. People who focus on health preservation think hard and want to replenish sperm and blood, fearing that they are not strong enough. How can they let it flow endlessly!? This serious danger cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>There are quite a few types of seminal emission drugs sold on the market now, but there are very few that truly have the effect of consolidating sperm and stopping leakage. Only Schmidt's "Sperm Consolidating Pills" are the most effective and can truly cure seminal emission. If premature ejaculation, impotence, and other symptoms occur due to seminal emission, then you must also take "Gonadal Hormone," and its effect will be even more outstanding.</p>

<p>(21) Chronic Gonorrhea and Mental Decline</p>
<p>Patient Shen Ziqiu, 24 years old, from Hunan, has been studying in Shanghai for five years. Last autumn, due to socializing with friends, he consorted with prostitutes and contracted gonorrhea. (Main complaint) Gonorrhea has dragged on and turned into chronic gonorrhea. Although the pain is less, he is mentally depressed. He often feels tinnitus, headaches, and dizziness. After walking a little, he feels frequent turbid urination and is unbearable. This spring, the disease became more serious, and there was blood in his urine. The urine was turbid. He took various medicines repeatedly, but none of them had much effect. He was introduced to my clinic for treatment by a friend the day before yesterday. (Treatment) I prescribed the yellow pigment preparation "Andi Lin" to completely cure his * turbidity. And all the neurasthenia caused by leukorrhea is supplemented with "Gonadal Hormone." After taking it for less than a month, the gonorrhea has healed, the urine is clear, and the body has recovered to health.</p>
<p>(22) Effective Results from Strengthening and Replenishing while Quitting Smoking for the Weak</p>
<p>Patient Xu Minqiang, 47 years old, from Pudong, Shanghai, said that he had been addicted to smoking as early as the 34th year of Guangxu, for as long as 28 years. Therefore, his body was extremely weak. He had repeatedly quit smoking, but failed halfway. His family was very worried. (Main complaint) Joint pain, and shortness of breath if he reduces the amount of smoking, so * he has not been able to succeed. (Current situation) — Because the family property has declined, he cannot spend a huge amount of money on cigarettes every day. He has been repeatedly pointed out by his family. Now he is determined to quit, and his son accompanies him to my clinic for treatment. (Treatment) — I diagnosed that Mr. Xu was too deeply poisoned. It is difficult to achieve complete success without using the method of strengthening and replenishing while quitting smoking. Therefore, I used "Gonadal Hormone" to eliminate his addiction, and at the same time injected "Yuweici Boming" for a period of two months. The smoking * was completely quit, and his health suddenly increased.</p>
<h3 id="e188">How Can One Obtain Perfect Development? <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Liu Zhimin</p>
<p>Incomplete development, in a narrow sense, refers to organs and tissues that are congenitally extremely small or deformed. In a broad sense, it refers to the fact that during the development period, whether due to congenital insufficiency or excessive masturbation, the muscles of the whole body cannot be fully and healthily developed. Patients with this disease are often accompanied by insufficient function, so it has a huge impact on life.</p>
<p>Some say that there is partial incomplete development. For example, the penis is still as small as a child even when it reaches adulthood. It is all due to insufficient endocrine secretion in the gonads. Regardless of the whole body and local parts, full and healthy development can be obtained.</p>
<p>Patient Zheng Zicheng, 29 years old, because of insufficient congenital endowment and masturbation during the development period, his body is soft and weak. Not only is the trunk short, but the muscles are also thin and weak. He is like a child, but looks like an old man. Since development is not healthy, he is often tired of things. He feels tired after a little operation. Although he has taken several kinds of tonics, they are not suitable for the disease, so he has not seen any improvement. Last winter, he was introduced by Mr. Zhang to my clinic for treatment. I observed that Mr. Zheng's disease cannot be effective without injecting gonad endocrine preparations. I immediately asked him to buy "Gonadal Hormone" from Zhongying Pharmacy. He immediately felt that his muscles were full, his body was strong and strong, his energy was full, and his spirit was invigorated. Not only did all parts of his body get good development, but even his attitude was like that of a 21 or 22-year-old. In social aspects, he is very popular with the opposite sex.</p>
<p>How to Quit Smoking</p>
<p>I am a resident of the concession and have been addicted to smoking for seven years. The accumulation of tobacco poison in the past seven years has weakened my body to the extreme. I wanted to quit smoking a long time ago, but because of my body, I was afraid to act rashly. Now I hear that the administrative organs in the concession have accepted the smoking cessation regulations of my government, so I am determined to quit. I intend to quit. I would like to ask what medicine is the fastest, least painful, and most economical and cost-effective. (Asked by Xu Dingchen)</p>
<p>Answer: Since your body is already weak, it will not work if you do not take "Gonadal Hormone." At the same time, please inject "Yuweici Boming," then quitting the addiction will be faster, the pain will be reduced, and it will be the most cost-effective.</p>
<p>Severe Stomach Pain</p>
<p>I have been suffering from stomach pain for three years, and when the pain attacks, I cannot swallow food. Sometimes I cannot even eat porridge. Please ask your doctor to tell me what medicine is the most effective. Wang Wencheng</p>
<p>Answer: You can take "Weitongling" to treat stomach diseases, and at the same time take "Jianweisu" to promote digestion and increase nutrition.</p>
<p>Lingering Leukorrhea</p>
<p>I have been suffering from lingering leukorrhea since I was fifteen years old. I thought it was a common disease that could not be cured. After giving birth last month, I still see leucorrhea, and it has a strange odor. I beg to be cured. Yuqin</p>
<p>Answer: Take female "Gonadal Hormone" internally and use "Liaoda Ling" externally to completely cure it. Breastfeeding is not a problem.</p>
<p>Seminal Emission and Kidney Weakness</p>
<p>I have been masturbating for a long time. In the past two years, I have repeatedly taken a certain product, but it has not been fully effective. Now I have symptoms of seminal emission, kidney weakness, exhaustion, and blood loss. Please advise on the treatment method. Respectfully, Hu Xiaohai</p>
<p>Answer: Please quit masturbation quickly and take "Gonadal Hormone" and Schmidt's "Sperm Consolidating Pills" to treat it.</p>

Within three months, he suffered from premature ejaculation. He was mentally depressed and had no fun in life. (Current symptoms) — Premature ejaculation is becoming more and more serious. Recently, he has suffered from insomnia, headaches, tinnitus, palpitations, and other symptoms. His spirit has greatly declined, and he has completely fallen into a state of premature aging. Recently, rural areas have gone bankrupt, so Zhou Jun came to Shanghai to learn business. Last month, he came to my clinic for treatment.

<h3 id="e189">Banning Private Schools from Over-Enrolling Students <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Jianping</p>
<p>The number of private elementary schools in this city is alarming. Therefore, there is the vulgar name of "Lane Elementary School." These types of "Lane Elementary Schools" are nothing more than a few speculators who intend to make a profit and then open such schools. Financial difficulties and the lack of talent have led to simplicity. The school has become a business store, and even the current social education system has been completely destroyed. It is even more unnecessary to hope that it can teach ordinary children to become good and useful talents. However, simplicity is still a school. Unfortunately, the scholars who run this kind of "Lane Elementary School" often turn students into goods or private property due to business competition. They use all means to buy, deceive, and win over. Once a student steps into the school gate, it is like the target of the "school merchants." They will not let you out of the school gate, unless you pay the tuition and all kinds of exorbitant taxes and fees, you will not be allowed to pass. In terms of "doing business" skills, this type of "school merchant" can be said to be very outstanding; if you talk about education, or making students aware of the current national society in times of crisis, survival, and life and death, only God knows.</p>
<p>Recently, the Municipal Education Bureau has also noticed the ugly and nauseating aspects of this type of "Lane Elementary School." According to the local news on the 12th: The Municipal Education Bureau, in view of the various bad behaviors of private schools, has a great impact on the entire education of this city. Therefore, it has strictly formulated three measures to ban them — 1. Schools shall not solicit students by improper means. If there is any incident of using teachers from neighboring schools to induce students to transfer, once verified, they will be banned without leniency. 2. Teachers who are employed within the unexpired period shall not transfer to other schools without the permission of the original principal. 3. If there are bad teachers who instigate students to transfer schools arbitrarily, once there is conclusive evidence, those who have registered will have their registration revoked, and schools shall not employ those who have not registered. Schools that employ such bad teachers shall be severely punished.</p>
<p>It is our great good fortune that the education authorities can pay attention to the fraudulent activities of this type of educational scum and do their best to strictly ban them. Among the three banning measures currently promulgated, what we are not satisfied with is that it is limited to the phenomenon of "soliciting students" and has not found that there are still many bad phenomena in this type of private school. However, the beginning of a thing is often not perfect. Of course, we cannot be too demanding. On the contrary, we only hope that after one thing is effective, we can more thoroughly understand the destruction of education by the general "school swindlers" and "school merchants" and ban them.</p>
<p>These three measures do not seem to be perfect either. The reason is that the focus is entirely on "bad teachers," while neglecting the proactive actors — those who take money out to run schools, aiming to earn back a sum of money, those types of guys who are nominally school directors, principals, or something. If there were no various inducements from them, I believe that ordinary teachers may not be "bad." Therefore, we advocate strictly banning the "school merchants" and "school swindlers" who are in charge, which is a more effective method. If the main culprit is not convicted, but the accomplices are convicted, this will always be a mess.</p>
<p>Finally, we also advocate taking active measures to ban this type of "Lane Elementary School." The method is to improve the school education itself and not allow it to have the slightest shortcomings, so that the "school merchants" and "school swindlers" will not have a chance to "take advantage of the loopholes."</p>

<p>— Shi Jida</p>
<p>I've written to several places where I might find a job, but haven't received a reply in ages. In the nearby areas, I always manage to scrape together a meager amount of travel expenses, taking buses or boats, or even walking, to visit relatives and friends, begging them to get me into some organization where they could secure a job to sustain my livelihood.</p>
<p>"My hopes are very, very small," Liu Jin thought, "just enough meager salary to avoid starvation."</p>
<p>However, society is facing rural bankruptcy and cities are suffering from anemia, shattering even Liu Jin's small hope. There are so many unemployed people that the competition for jobs is becoming increasingly fierce, creating extreme difficulties for someone like Liu Jin with his social standing.</p>
<p>"Brother," he would say things like, "I've been unemployed for a year now. If I don't find a job soon, not only will I be in trouble, but my whole family will starve!"</p>
<p>Although the other party holds great sympathy, the answers are always vague and confusing.</p>
<p>"Brother, wait a little longer and see."</p>
<p>"Maybe there will be something, maybe not, I can't say for sure, it all depends on your luck."</p>
<p>Some even say:</p>
<p>"Please don't be anxious. You can't rush this. It depends on the opportunity, on the opportunity."</p>
<p>"Don't say you've been unemployed for a year, some people have been unemployed for two or three years and still haven't found anything."</p>
<p>Even more directly refuse.</p>
<p>"Please forgive me! My own position is a bit shaky right now."</p>
<p>"I don't think there's a way. If there were, why wouldn't I try to help you? There are still layoffs here, still layoffs!"</p>
<p>Each time he received such an answer, all his hopes were shattered; he dragged his body back dejectedly, knowing that the travel expenses were wasted again. And for an unemployed person, how much of a loss are these meager travel expenses!</p>
<p>"For me, one copper is worth more than a silver dollar! More! " he shouted angrily when he returned.</p>
<p>But what could he do? If he didn't try, the opportunity would never suddenly fall into his lap, but each blow made his heart sink lower. And now, after too many blows, his vision was almost completely dark.</p>
<p>The replies from afar also arrived one by one. But what were they? It was just another set of perfunctory, or even apologetic, letters! Even more disheartening, some people didn't even reply, making him long for a response and feel extremely annoyed!</p>
<p>So, the items in the house were almost all pawned off, and borrowing had reached the point where it was almost impossible to borrow any more. The family lived frugally, but it was still difficult to satisfy the daily need for rice, and the desire to find a job became more and more urgent; finding a job seemed to become more and more distant.</p>
<p>He tried his best to find "recruitment" or "employment" advertisements in the newspapers, but each time he read them, he felt discouraged. What "two hundred yuan deposit," what "famous person's introduction or guarantee," etc. So, each time, he would angrily throw the newspaper away or tear it up.</p>
<p>"If I had two hundred yuan, if I knew a famous person, how would I be afraid of being unemployed!" he shouted. A dark shadow floated in his heart.</p>
<p>He also went to employment agencies to register, filled out long forms, or talked sincerely with the staff. But what use is sincere conversation to an unemployed person?</p>
<p>"We will definitely notify you when there is an opportunity," the staff told him.</p>
<p>However, the notification was long, long overdue. Later, there was a notification, but after contacting them, either he was not qualified, or the conditions were too harsh. He qualified for two jobs, and the conditions had already been agreed upon, waiting only for the final decision ("How wonderful!" Now there are two opportunities, this time I won't be disappointed, he thought.) But on the day of signing the contract, an employee of one agency told him in the morning:</p>
<p>"I'm sorry! Our agency has suddenly suffered an unexpected blow and we don't need anyone right now! It's so difficult to get things done these days!"</p>
<p>And in the afternoon, an employee of another introduction agency noti</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>fied him:</p>
<p>"Mr. Liu Jin: That position has already been taken by someone else. There are so many unemployed people now! So many! Those who are a little lacking are really being wronged!"</p>
<p>Then the whole world collapsed before Liu Jin's eyes, and his eyes blurred!</p>
<p>"Let me die! Let me die! This world! This world!" he shouted angrily, thinking of his family starving, and couldn't help but shed tears.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Summer Brothels <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Dai</p>
<p>Yantai is a bustling city on the Bohai Sea coast. In summer, this place is called a "summer resort." In fact, it is true. As soon as it gets hot, the wealthy people double in number, and the prosperity of the market naturally has a new turn. I have stayed here twice before, but they were all violent winters with wind and snow, and the time was not long. At that time, Yantai gave me the impression that the time was not long. At that time, Yantai gave me the impression of angry sea waves, refugees begging from afar, groups of slaves whipped by hunger, and the miserable scene caused by the cold, all of which were heartbreaking. This is the third time I have come to this place. Because it is summer, the face of this city presents a different form. The sky is hanging with a scorching sun, and the red-roofed foreign houses and cement roads are scorching hot. Carts from the countryside are constantly walking around, and the mules pulling the carts are sweating profusely. Dirty dock coolies sweating with sweat are busy transporting goods under the scorching sun. The sea is so calm, and small motorboats, like flying birds, are running freely on the sea. American sailors, all white, are singing songs, as if deliberately mocking the sampan men.</p>
<p>There are quite a few people who put their hopes in the summer season. They are looking forward to the arrival of American warships and the start of all the seasonal businesses. Dance halls, Western restaurants, cafes, flower shops, and fruit companies have everything that American sailors and other vacationers need. As a result of their lifestyle habits, the people of Yantai do not feel threatened by the thirty or forty warships staying in the harbor. They always say that they are here to "rest" (note: meaning "summer resort"). After all, it is an infringement of our freedom. Why do they casually station warships in our harbor? The people of Yantai seem to be unclear about these things. They only know that "summer is here and they can earn money from foreigners."</p>
<p>In summer, Yantai is almost like a colony. The bloodstains of trampled slaves are everywhere, and as long as you are not deaf, you can still hear the roars of the hungry. The prostitutes in the "summer brothels" are slaves who are forced by life to sell their bodies. Every night I walked from the street under Yantai Mountain to the back coast. From this street, you can see countless "summer brothels." They do business entirely with foreigners. In other words, they are here for American sailors. If you pay a little attention while walking on this street, you will see those flamboyantly dressed Cantonese prostitutes and those drunk foreign sailors. I thought about going to the brothel to see it a few times, but I never mustered up the courage. So I only looked at the exterior when I passed by at night, but I really wanted to know the content of their lives. So I went to ask a friend who had been to the "summer brothel." That friend worked in a British foreign firm. Because he had money, he often went to brothels. According to him, he often went to "summer brothels" and was very familiar with the situation inside, but he was unwilling to tell me:</p>
<p>——You are young, don’t ask about those things!</p>
<p>He was kind and told me that he was afraid that I would learn bad things. In fact, he was wrong. How could a wanderer like me have the spare money to spend on prostitutes? Fortunately, I had this good opportunity. One night: I was walking alone on the back coast. The annoying foreign sailors were drunk and quarreling and fighting, kicking over the rickshaw puller’s rickshaw. I couldn’t bear to witness that tragic scene, so I quietly walked to the rocks and sat down to rest, looking at the star-like lights on the warships in the sea, and huge shadows moving on the water. The coolies’ cries coming from the west wharf were so beautiful.</p>
<p>——Hey! ——Suddenly someone patted my shoulder——When did you come?</p>
<p>It was Mr. Sun Weimin, the friend I mentioned who worked in a British firm. Behind him was a woman, whose face I could not see in the dark. When she sat on the rock next to me, I saw her dress from the shadows. Obviously she was a prostitute, and the style of her clothes was clearly from the "summer brothel."</p>
<p>The three of us sat on the rock and started chatting. Weimin likes to joke, and his speech is always humorous. We talked about the stars and the moon, and then we talked about the sea. The woman spoke:</p>
<p>——The sea looks cute now, but I am afraid of the sea. The year before last, my mother took me to Hong Kong from Xiamen, and she died by throwing herself into the sea. Last year, when I came to Yantai from Hong Kong, I encountered wind and waves again, which made me dizzy and almost die. Alas, I am really afraid of the sea. Why did someone invent trains and airplanes, but no one invented machines to fill the sea!</p>
<p>——If there is no sea, we will be drowned?</p>
<p>In the course of the conversation, she revealed her life story, and I took the opportunity to ask about the situation in their "summer brothel."</p>
<p>——Sir! Everyone says that we people in this line of work have no conscience, which is too wrong. We can't control our own bodies. We have to do whatever the madam tells us to do. She is for money, and what about us? We are the tools for her to make money. It is really extremely difficult for us to come to Yantai to do this three-month business. You can't do it if you can't speak English, and you can't do it if you can't sing foreign songs. The brothels here in Yantai (Note: That is, summer brothels) are all opened by Cantonese people, and the sisters are also Cantonese. They usually work in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Shanghai; when summer comes, they rush to this place. Alas! Those foreign sailors are too fierce, and they beat the sisters at every turn. No one wants to receive foreigners! ……”</p>
<p>The boundless night was floating on the sea. The warships were signaling SLE... The sound of the tide hitting the rocks and the roar of the ship's whistle suppressed the sound of the sampan's oars. We left the coast, and Weimin and the prostitute went back. I went to sleep. When I returned home, the apprentices were talking about the foreign sailors beating the prostitute to death.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Peach Blossom Spring"</p>
<p>Where is the fairy source to escape tea? In ancient times, there was a Wuling man who explored the secluded place. He was a fisherman who was leisurely in his profession. He came and went frequently on a boat of smoke and waves. He forgot how far or near the journey was. He only cared about going forward along the green stream. Suddenly, he saw peach blossoms on both sides of the bank that were redder than brocade. The reeds on the embankment were as green as grass. At the end of the forest, a good mountain rose up to meet him. The entrance of the cave was bright. The fisherman abandoned his boat and went ashore. He walked into the village through the peach blossoms. The fields were crisscrossed with mulberry and bamboo trees. The crowing of chickens and the barking of dogs could be heard in the distance. The men and women in the fields were dressed in ancient clothes. Suddenly, they met and laughed affectionately. The elderly and the young all looked happy. They killed chickens and made food to feast on the guests. They said that their ancestors had fled from the Qin Dynasty and lived in seclusion here. Today, they do not know what world it is, as if they are cut off from the mortal world. The fisherman described the events of today in detail. They sighed at the changes in the world. They prepared wine and food and invited him to stay. They were very kind to each other. The fisherman returned after several days. They all said, "Do not tell the outside world about this encounter." The fisherman returned to his boat and marked the original road. He told the governor to come to the stream. He left people to follow and explore again, but the entrance to the cave was gone. The virtuous scholar Liu Ziji from Nanyang was also in vain. From then on, no one asked about it again.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Pipa of Xunyang"</p>
<p>Sima Xiangshan went down to Jiangzhou. He stayed overnight at the ancient head of Xunyang Ferry. He sent off guests sadly and said goodbye. The reed flowers and maple leaves were in the late autumn of the river. I thought to myself, "I am sad that I have been exiled like a floating weed." The ancestor sent me off to board the boat on the water. Looking at the moon in the middle of the river, it was already the second watch when the watchtower was set up. Suddenly, I heard the sound of decay and the strings were plucked. Why is it so desolate that it seems to be complaining? Therefore, the host and guests searched for the sound and were close to the neighboring boat. They called him to move the boat to see each other, and he was half shy. Seeing that Qiu Niang was old but still charming, she added a pot of wine to the table. I only heard that she narrated her life and lingered in old dreams. But how could the spring flowers and autumn moon not stay again? The Kun string was pressed on the silver armor. Who knew that the mandarin duck tent was empty and the jade hook fell. The past is unbearable to look back on. There are endless stories from the bottom of my heart. Seeing that she was. There was only hatred left in the residual grease and powder. The blood-stained pomegranate skirt. Later, the carriages and horses gradually became scarce and desolate. How could she marry a husband from Fuliang and go and stay? It was like an autumn wind discarding the palace silk fan. It is difficult to invite the jade axe to repair the missing moon. It is known that the ancient Huanxi is the same as the officialdom. The vicissitudes of life have changed over the long years. I am also a wanderer in the world. I advise you to play another song and ask for more. It is all because I have nothing to give to you, so I will make a new tune and sing to repay you. When the song is over and the wine is gone and people are gone. A cry of the road back is heard. I only feel that red pink and blue tears are flowing.</p>

<p>Yuanchang (1120) Midnight 0:45 to 1:30 AM</p>
<p>Opening "Feng Huan of Qi" (Mimi Collection Listed Number) Feng Huan of Qi was poor and of humble origins. He once visited Lord Mengchang. He went to the door with a card in hand. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, he asked for his name. He was embarrassed by his shabby clothes and appearance. The guest was neither good nor capable. Knowing that you are generous and righteous, I am willing to be one of the three thousand retainers. He had already divided the houses into three classes, upper, middle, and lower. In the end, Lord Mengchang loved his guests. When he was idle, he leaned against the pillar and strummed his sword three times. When eating, there was no fish, and when going out, he had no carriage. Moreover, he had no food or clothing for his family. The generous Tian Wen did not refuse. He proudly told his neighbors. One day, he went to collect debts in the snow. Naturally, Mr. Feng Huan worked hard. He falsely conveyed an imperial decree, burned the contracts, and rewarded the poor people with beef and wine. He returned empty-handed to report. He made a name for you by buying righteousness. Unexpectedly, the King of Qi took back the prime minister's seal. The elders in Xue thanked him deeply. Feng Huan went to the state of Qin to persuade. He talked eloquently, and every sentence was listened to. He hired Tian Wen with high carriages and four horses. The state of Qi respectfully hired him from the state of Qin. He was still the prime minister in the court. Feng Huan's power brought half a lifetime of wealth. The three thousand retainers were difficult to judge. His wisdom and resourcefulness surpassed the past and the present.</p>

<p>Extra Notes</p>
<p>The Minyin Harmonica Society, organized by harmonica veterans Zhang Zhiren and scholars Chen Tianying and Zhao Jianqing, caused a sensation in Shanghai. Since April 10, when the main members of the society, Zhao Jianqing, Chen Tianying, etc., went to Suzhou for collective training, the special program has been suspended. It is now reported that the training period has expired, and they returned to Shanghai on the 10th of this month. It is expected that they will broadcast special programs on major radio stations soon, and it is believed that they will have better results and be heard by people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>The Yuanchang Broadcasting Station at No. 7, Sanrang Lane, Caishi Road, Shanghai, recently added a wireless radio repair department to meet the needs of listeners, specializing in repairing all kinds of wireless radios, with low prices, reliable projects, and fast delivery. For telephone notification, please call 82985. The station will send an engineer for free inspection upon receiving the call.</p>

<p>Since its publication, the Huguang Weekly has been warmly welcomed by readers in this city and other cities. The fourth issue was originally scheduled to be published on the 10th, but due to an unexpected incident between the journal and the printing house, it could not be published as scheduled. The fourth issue of the journal is now approved for publication on the 22nd of this month. The content is better than before, and the printing is exquisite and spectacular. There are more than 40 copperplate illustrations, and the cover is Shao Meiling, a dance star from Dahu Garden, specially printed in three-color collotype. Major dance halls, major theaters, and news vendors are all acting as sales agents.</p>
